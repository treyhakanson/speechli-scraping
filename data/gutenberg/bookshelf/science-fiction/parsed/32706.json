A couple of hundreds of\nmillions of years either way do not matter, since at least that much\ntime was required for the inter-passage. At about that same time--within\nthe same plus-or-minus ten percent margin of error, it is\nbelieved--practically all of the suns of both those galaxies became\npossessed of planets.\n\nThere is much evidence to support the belief that it was not merely a\ncoincidence that so many planets came into being at about the same time\nas the galactic inter-passage. Another school of thought holds that it\nwas pure coincidence; that all suns have planets as naturally and as\ninevitably as cats have kittens.\n\nBe that as it may, Arisian records are clear upon the point that before\nthe two galaxies began to coalesce, there were never more than three\nsolar systems present in either; and usually only one. Thus, when the\nsun of the planet upon which their race originated grew old and cool,\nthe Arisians were hard put to it to preserve their culture, since they\nhad to work against time in solving the engineering problems associated\nwith moving a planet from an older to a younger sun.\n\nSince nothing material was destroyed when the Eddorians were forced into\nthe next plane of existence, their historical records also have become\navailable. Those records--folios and tapes and playable discs of\nplatinum alloy, resistant indefinitely even to Eddore's noxious\natmosphere--agree with those of the Arisians upon this point.\nImmediately before the Coalescence began there was one, and only one,\nplanetary solar system in the Second Galaxy; and, until the advent of\nEddore, the Second Galaxy was entirely devoid of intelligent life.\n\nThus for millions upon untold millions of years the two races, each the\nsole intelligent life of a galaxy, perhaps of an entire space-time\ncontinuum, remained completely in ignorance of each other. Both were\nalready ancient at the time of the Coalescence. The only other respect\nin which the two were similar, however, was in the possession of minds\nof power.\n\nSince Arisia was Earth-like in composition, atmosphere, and climate, the\nArisians were at that time distinctly humanoid. The Eddorians were not.\nEddore was and is large and dense; its liquid a poisonous, sludgy syrup;\nits atmosphere a foul and corrosive fog. Eddore was and is unique; so\ndifferent from any other world of either galaxy that its very existence\nwas inexplicable until its own records revealed the fact that it did not\noriginate in normal space-time at all, but came to our universe from\nsome alien and horribly different other.\n\nAs differed the planets, so differed the peoples. The Arisians went\nthrough the usual stages of savagery and barbarism on the way to\nCivilization. The Age of Stone. The Ages of Bronze, of Iron, of Steel,\nand of Electricity. Indeed, it is probable that it is because the\nArisians went through these various stages that all subsequent\nCivilizations have done so, since the spores which burgeoned into life\nupon the cooling surfaces of all the planets of the commingling galaxies\nwere Arisian, not Eddorian, in origin. Eddorian spores, while\nundoubtedly present, must have been so alien that they could not develop\nin any one of the environments, widely variant although they are,\nexisting naturally or coming naturally into being in normal space and\ntime.\n\nThe Arisians--especially after atomic energy freed them from physical\nlabor--devoted themselves more and ever more intensively to the\nexploration of the limitless possibilities of the mind.\n\nEven before the Coalescence, then, the Arisians had need neither of\nspace-ships nor of telescopes. By power of mind alone they watched the\nlenticular aggregation of stars which was much later to be known to\nTellurian astronomers as Lundmark's Nebula approach their own galaxy.\nThey observed attentively and minutely and with high elation the\noccurrence of mathematical impossibility; for the chance of two galaxies\never meeting in direct, central, equatorial-plane impact and of passing\ncompletely through each other is an infinitesimal of such a high order\nas to be, even mathematically, practically indistinguishable from zero.\n\nThey observed the birth of numberless planets, recording minutely in\ntheir perfect memories every detail of everything that happened; in the\nhope that, as ages passed, either they or their descendants would be\nable to develop a symbology and a methodology capable of explaining the\nthen inexplicable phenomenon. Carefree, busy, absorbedly intent, the\nArisian mentalities roamed throughout space--until one of them struck an\nEddorian mind.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhile any Eddorian could, if it chose, assume the form of a man, they\nwere in no sense man-like. Nor, since the term implies a softness and a\nlack of organization, can they be described as being amoeboid. They were\nboth versatile and variant. Each Eddorian changed, not only its shape,\nbut also its texture, in accordance with the requirements of the moment.\nEach produced--extruded--members whenever and wherever it needed them;\nmembers uniquely appropriate to the task then in work. If hardness was\nindicated, the members were hard; if softness, they were soft. Small or\nlarge, rigid or flexible; joined or tentacular--all one. Filaments or\ncables; fingers or feet; needles or mauls--equally simple. One thought\nand the body fitted the job.\n\nThey were asexual: sexless to a degree unapproached by any form of\nTellurian life higher than the yeasts. They were not merely\nhermaphroditic, nor androgynous, nor parthenogenetic. They were\ncompletely without sex. They were also, to all intents and purposes and\nexcept for death by violence, immortal. For each Eddorian, as its mind\napproached the stagnation of saturation after a lifetime of millions of\nyears, simply divided into two new-old beings. New in capacity and in\nzest; old in ability and in power, since each of the two \"children\"\npossessed in toto the knowledges and the memories of their one \"parent.\"\n\nAnd if it is difficult to describe in words the physical aspects of the\nEddorians, it is virtually impossible to write or to draw, in any\nsymbology of Civilization, a true picture of an Eddorian's--_any_\nEddorian's--mind. They were intolerant, domineering, rapacious,\ninsatiable, cold, callous, and brutal. They were keen, capable,\npersevering, analytical, and efficient. They had no trace of any of the\nsofter emotions or sensibilities possessed by races adherent to\nCivilization. No Eddorian ever had anything even remotely resembling a\nsense of humor.\n\nWhile not essentially bloodthirsty--that is, not loving bloodshed for\nits own sweet sake--they were no more averse to blood-letting than they\nwere in favor of it. Any amount of killing which would or which might\nadvance an Eddorian toward his goal was commendable; useless slaughter\nwas frowned upon, not because it was slaughter, but because it was\nuseless--and hence inefficient.\n\nAnd, instead of the multiplicity of goals sought by the various entities\nof any race of Civilization, each and every Eddorian had only one. The\nsame one: power. _Power!_ P-O-W-E-R!!\n\nSince Eddore was peopled originally by various races, perhaps as similar\nto each other as are the various human races of Earth, it is\nunderstandable that the early history of the planet--while it was still\nin its own space, that is--was one of continuous and ages-long war. And,\nsince war always was and probably always will be linked solidly to\ntechnological advancement, the race now known simply as \"The Eddorians\"\nbecame technologists supreme. All other races disappeared. So did all\nother forms of life, however lowly, which interfered in any way with the\nMasters of the Planet.\n\nThen, all racial opposition liquidated and overmastering lust as\nunquenched as ever, the surviving Eddorians fought among themselves:\n\"push-button\" wars employing engines of destruction against which the\nonly possible defense was a fantastic thickness of planetary bedrock.\n\nFinally, unable either to kill or to enslave each other, the\ncomparatively few survivors made a peace of sorts. Since their own space\nwas practically barren of planetary systems, they would move their\nplanet from space to space until they found one which so teemed with\nplanets that each living Eddorian could become the sole Master of an\never increasing number of worlds. This was a program very much\nworthwhile, promising as it did an outlet for even the recognizedly\ninsatiable Eddorian craving for power. Therefore the Eddorians, for the\nfirst time in their prodigiously long history of fanatical\nnon-cooperation, decided to pool their resources of mind and of material\nand to work as a group.\n\nUnion of a sort was accomplished eventually; neither peaceably nor\nwithout highly lethal friction. They knew that a democracy, by its very\nnature, was inefficient; hence a democratic form of government was not\neven considered. An efficient government must of necessity be\ndictatorial. Nor were they all exactly alike or of exactly equal\nability; perfect identity of any two such complex structures was in fact\nimpossible, and any difference, however slight, was ample justification\nfor stratification in such a society as theirs.\n\nThus one of them, fractionally more powerful and more ruthless than the\nrest, became the All-Highest--His Ultimate Supremacy--and a group of\nabout a dozen others, only infinitesimally weaker, became his Council; a\ncabinet which was later to become known as the Innermost Circle. The\ntally of this cabinet varied somewhat from age to age; increasing by one\nwhen a member divided, decreasing by one when a jealous fellow or an\nenvious underling managed to perpetrate a successful assassination.\n\nAnd thus, at long last, the Eddorians began really to work together.\nThere resulted, among other things, the hyper-spatial tube and the fully\ninertialess drive--the drive which was, millions of years later, to be\ngiven to Civilization by an Arisian operating under the name of\nBergenholm. Another result, which occured shortly after the galactic\ninter-passage had begun, was the eruption into normal space of the\nplanet Eddore.\n\n\"I must now decide whether to make this space our permanent headquarters\nor to search farther,\" the All-Highest radiated harshly to his Council.\n\"On the one hand, it will take some time for even those planets which\nhave already formed to cool. Still more will be required for life to\ndevelop sufficiently to form a part of the empire which we have planned\nor to occupy our abilities to any great degree. On the other, we have\nalready spent millions of years in surveying hundreds of millions of\ncontinua, without having found anywhere such a profusion of planets as\nwill, in all probability, soon fill both of these galaxies. There may\nalso be certain advantages inherent in the fact that these planets are\nnot yet populated. As life develops, we can mold it as we please.\nKrongenes, what are your findings in regard to the planetary\npossibilities of other spaces?\"\n\nThe term \"Krongenes\" was not, in the accepted sense, a name. Or, rather,\nit was more than a name. It was a key-thought, in mental shorthand; a\ncondensation and abbreviation of the life-pattern or ego of that\nparticular Eddorian.\n\n\"Not at all promising, Your Supremacy,\" Krongenes replied promptly. \"No\nspace within reach of my instruments has more than a small fraction of\nthe inhabitable worlds which will presently exist in this one.\"\n\n\"Very well. Have any of you others any valid objections to the\nestablishment of our empire here in this space? If so, give me your\nthought now.\"\n\nNo objecting thoughts appeared, since none of the monsters then knew\nanything of Arisia or of the Arisians. Indeed, even if they had known,\nit is highly improbable that any objection would have been raised.\nFirst, because no Eddorian, from the All-Highest down, could conceive or\nwould under any circumstances admit that any race, anywhere, had ever\napproached or ever would approach the Eddorians in any quality\nwhatever; and second, because, as is routine in all dictatorships,\ndisagreement with the All-Highest did not operate to lengthen the span\nof life.\n\n\"Very well. We will now confer as to ... but hold! That thought is not\none of ours! Who are you, stranger, to dare to intrude thus upon a\nconference of the Innermost Circle?\"\n\n\"I am Enphilistor, a younger student, of the planet Arisia.\" This name,\ntoo, was a symbol. Nor was the young Arisian yet a Watchman, as he and\nso many of his fellows were so soon to become, for before Eddore's\narrival Arisia had had no need of Watchmen. \"I am not intruding, as you\nknow. I have not touched any one of your minds; have not read any one of\nyour thoughts. I have been waiting for you to notice my presence, so\nthat we could become acquainted with each other. A surprising\ndevelopment, truly--we have thought for many cycles of time that we were\nthe only highly advanced life in this universe....\"\n\n\"Be silent, worm, in the presence of the Masters. Land your ship and\nsurrender, and your planet will be allowed to serve us. Refuse, or even\nhesitate, and every individual of your race shall die.\"\n\n\"Worm? Masters? Land my ship?\" The young Arisian's thought was pure\ncuriosity, with no tinge of fear, dismay, or awe. \"Surrender? Serve you?\nI seem to be receiving your thought without ambiguity, but your meaning\nis entirely....\"\n\n\"Address me as 'Your Supremacy',\" the All-Highest directed, coldly.\n\"Land now or die now--this is your last warning.\"\n\n\"Your Supremacy? Certainly, if that is the customary form. But as to\nlanding--and warning--and dying--surely you do not think that I am\npresent in the flesh? And can it be possible that you are actually so\naberrant as to believe that you can kill me--or even the youngest\nArisian infant? What a peculiar--what an _extraordinary_--psychology!\"\n\n\"Die, then, worm, if you must have it so!\" the All-Highest snarled, and\nlaunched a mental bolt whose energies were calculated to slay any living\nthing.\n\nEnphilistor, however, parried the vicious attack without apparent\neffort. His manner did not change. He did not strike back.\n\nThe Eddorian then drove in with an analyzing probe, only to be surprised\nagain--the Arisian's thought could not be traced! And Enphilistor, while\nwarding off the raging Eddorian, directed a quiet thought as though he\nwere addressing someone close by his side:\n\n\"Come in, please, one or more of the Elders. There is a situation here\nwhich I am not qualified to handle.\"\n\n\"We, the Elders of Arisia in fusion, are here.\" A grave, deeply resonant\npseudo-voice filled the Eddorians' minds; each perceived in\nthree-dimensional fidelity an aged, white-bearded human face. \"You of\nEddore have been expected. The course of action which we must take has\nbeen determined long since. You will forget this incident completely.\nFor cycles upon cycles of time to come no Eddorian shall know that we\nArisians exist.\"\n\nEven before the thought was issued the fused Elders had gone quietly and\nsmoothly to work. The Eddorians forgot utterly the incident which had\njust happened. Not one of them retained in his conscious mind any\ninkling that Eddore did not possess the only intelligent life in space.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd upon distant Arisia a full meeting of minds was held.\n\n\"But why didn't you simply kill them?\" Enphilistor asked. \"Such action\nwould be distasteful in the extreme, of course--almost impossible--but\neven I can perceive....\" He paused, overcome by his thought.\n\n\"That which you perceive, youth, is but a very small fraction of the\nwhole. We did not attempt to slay them because we could not have done\nso. Not because of squeamishness, as you intimate, but from sheer\ninability. The Eddorian tenacity of life is a thing far beyond your\npresent understanding; to have attempted to kill them would have\nrendered it impossible to make them forget us. We must have time ...\ncycles and cycles of time.\" The fusion broke off, pondered for minutes,\nthen addressed the group as a whole:\n\n\"We, the Elder Thinkers, have not shared fully with you our\nvisualization of the Cosmic All, because until the Eddorians actually\nappeared there was always the possibility that our findings might have\nbeen in error. Now, however, there is no doubt. The Civilization which\nhas been pictured as developing peacefully upon all the teeming planets\nof two galaxies will not now of itself come into being. We of Arisia\nshould be able to bring it eventually to full fruition, but the task\nwill be long and difficult.\n\n\"The Eddorians' minds are of tremendous latent power. Were they to know\nof us now, it is practically certain that they would be able to develop\npowers and mechanisms by the use of which they would negate our every\neffort--they would hurl us out of this, our native space and time. We\nmust have time ... given time, we shall succeed. There shall be Lenses\n... and entities of Civilization worthy in every respect to wear them.\nBut we of Arisia alone will never be able to conquer the Eddorians.\nIndeed, while this is not yet certain, the probability is exceedingly\ngreat that despite our utmost efforts at self-development our\ndescendants will have to breed, from some people to evolve upon a planet\nnot yet in existence, an entirely new race--a race tremendously more\ncapable than ours--to succeed us as Guardians of Civilization.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Centuries passed. Millenia. Cosmic and geologic ages. Planets cooled to\nsolidity and stability. Life formed and grew and developed. And as life\nevolved it was subjected to, and strongly if subtly affected by, the\ndiametrically opposed forces of Arisia and Eddore._\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nTHE FALL OF ATLANTIS\n\n1. EDDORE\n\n\n\"Members of the innermost circle, wherever you are and whatever you may\nbe doing, tune in!\" the All-Highest broadcast. \"Analysis of the data\nfurnished by the survey just completed shows that in general the Great\nPlan is progressing satisfactorily. There seem to be only four planets\nwhich our delegates have not been or may not be able to control\nproperly: Sol III, Rigel IV, Velantia III, and Palain VII. All four, you\nwill observe, are in the other galaxy. No trouble whatever has developed\nin our own.\n\n\"Of these four, the first requires drastic and immediate personal\nattention. Its people, in the brief interval since our previous general\nsurvey, have developed nuclear energy and have fallen into a cultural\npattern which does not conform in any respect to the basic principles\nlaid down by us long since. Our deputies there, thinking erroneously\nthat they could handle matters without reporting fully to or calling for\nhelp upon the next higher operating echelon, must be disciplined\nsharply. Failure, from whatever cause, can not be tolerated.\n\n\"Gharlane, as Master Number Two, you will assume control of Sol III\nimmediately. This Circle now authorizes and instructs you to take\nwhatever steps may prove necessary to restore order upon that planet.\nExamine carefully this data concerning the other three worlds which may\nvery shortly become troublesome. Is it your thought that one or more\nothers of this Circle should be assigned to work with you, to be sure\nthat these untoward developments are suppressed?\"\n\n\"It is not, Your Supremacy,\" that worthy decided, after a time of study.\n\"Since the peoples in question are as yet of low intelligence; since one\nform of flesh at a time is all that will have to be energized; and since\nthe techniques will be essentially similar; I can handle all four more\nefficiently alone than with the help or cooperation of others. If I read\nthis data correctly, there will be need of only the most elementary\nprecaution in the employment of mental force, since of the four races,\nonly the Velantians have even a rudimentary knowledge of its uses.\nRight?\"\n\n\"We so read the data.\" Surprisingly enough, the Innermost Circle agreed\nunanimously.\n\n\"Go, then. When finished, report in full.\"\n\n\"I go, All-Highest. I shall render a complete and conclusive report.\"\n\n\n2. ARISIA\n\n\"We, the Elder Thinkers in fusion, are spreading in public view, for\nstudy and full discussion, a visualization of the relationships existing\nand to exist between Civilization and its irreconcilable and implacable\nfoe. Several of our younger members, particularly Eukonidor, who has\njust attained Watchmanship, have requested instruction in this matter.\nBeing as yet immature, their visualizations do not show clearly why\nNedanillor, Kriedigan, Drounli, and Brolenteen, either singly or in\nfusion, have in the past performed certain acts and have not performed\ncertain others; or that the future actions of those Moulders of\nCivilization will be similarly constrained.\n\n\"This visualization, while more complex, more complete, and more\ndetailed than the one set up by our forefathers at the time of the\nCoalescence, agrees with it in every essential. The five basics remain\nunchanged. First: the Eddorians can be overcome only by mental force.\nSecond: the magnitude of the required force is such that its only\npossible generator is such an organization as the Galactic Patrol toward\nwhich we have been and are working. Third: since no Arisian or any\nfusion of Arisians will ever be able to spear-head that force, it was\nand is necessary to develop a race of mentality sufficient to perform\nthat task. Fourth: this new race, having been instrumental in removing\nthe menace of Eddore, will as a matter of course displace the Arisians\nas Guardians of Civilization. Fifth: the Eddorians must not become\ninformed of us until such a time as it will be physically,\nmathematically impossible for them to construct any effective\ncounter-devices.\"\n\n\"A cheerless outlook, truly,\" came a somber thought.\n\n\"Not so, daughter. A little reflection will show you that your present\nthinking is loose and turbid. When that time comes, every Arisian will\nbe ready for the change. We know the way. We do not know to what that\nway leads; but the Arisian purpose in this phase of existence--this\nspace-time continuum--will have been fulfilled and we will go eagerly\nand joyfully on to the next. Are there any more questions?\"\n\nThere were none.\n\n\"Study this material, then, each of you, with exceeding care. It may be\nthat some one of you, even a child, will perceive some facet of the\ntruth which we have missed or have not examined fully; some fact or\nimplication which may be made to operate to shorten the time of conflict\nor to lessen the number of budding Civilizations whose destruction seems\nto us at present to be sheerly unavoidable.\"\n\nHours passed. Days. No criticisms or suggestions were offered.\n\n\"We take it, then, that this visualization is the fullest and most\naccurate one possible for the massed intellect of Arisia to construct\nfrom the information available at the moment. The Moulders therefore,\nafter describing briefly what they have already done, will inform us as\nto what they deem it necessary to do in the near future.\"\n\n\"We have observed, and at times have guided, the evolution of\nintelligent life upon many planets,\" the fusion began. \"We have, to the\nbest of our ability, directed the energies of these entities into the\nchannels of Civilization; we have adhered consistently to the policy of\nsteering as many different races as possible toward the intellectual\nlevel necessary for the effective use of the Lens, without which the\nproposed Galactic Patrol cannot come into being.\n\n\"For many cycles of time we have been working as individuals with the\nfour strongest races, from one of which will be developed the people who\nwill one day replace us as Guardians of Civilization. Blood lines have\nbeen established. We have encouraged matings which concentrate traits\nof strength and dissipate those of weakness. While no very great\ndeparture from the norm, either physically or mentally, will take place\nuntil after the penultimates have been allowed to meet and to mate, a\ndefinite general improvement of each race has been unavoidable.\n\n\"Thus the Eddorians have already interested themselves in our budding\nCivilization upon the planet Tellus, and it is inevitable that they will\nvery shortly interfere with our work upon the other three. These four\nyoung Civilizations must be allowed to fall. It is to warn every Arisian\nagainst well-meant but inconsidered action that this conference was\ncalled. We ourselves will operate through forms of flesh of no higher\nintelligence than, and indistinguishable from, the natives of the\nplanets affected. No traceable connection will exist between those forms\nand us. No other Arisians will operate within extreme range of any one\nof those four planets; they will from now on be given the same status as\nhas been so long accorded Eddore itself. The Eddorians must not learn of\nus until after it is too late for them to act effectively upon that\nknowledge. Any chance bit of information obtained by any Eddorian must\nbe obliterated at once. It is to guard against and to negate such\naccidental disclosures that our Watchmen have been trained.\"\n\n\"But if all of our Civilizations go down....\" Eukonidor began to\nprotest.\n\n\"Study will show you, youth, that the general level of mind, and hence\nof strength, is rising,\" the fused Elders interrupted. \"The trend is\never upward; each peak and valley being higher than its predecessor.\nWhen the indicated level has been reached--the level at which the\nefficient use of the Lens will become possible--we will not only allow\nourselves to become known to them; we will engage them at every point.\"\n\n\"One factor remains obscure.\" A Thinker broke the ensuing silence. \"In\nthis visualization I do not perceive anything to preclude the\npossibility that the Eddorians may at any time visualize us. Granted\nthat the Elders of long ago did not merely visualize the Eddorians, but\nperceived them in time-space surveys; that they and subsequent Elders\nwere able to maintain the status quo; and that the Eddorian way of\nthought is essentially mechanistic, rather than philosophic, in nature.\nThere is still a possibility that the enemy may be able to deduce us by\nprocesses of logic alone. This thought is particularly disturbing to me\nat the present time because a rigid statistical analysis of the\noccurrences upon those four planets shows that they cannot possibly\nhave been due to chance. With such an analysis as a starting point, a\nmind of even moderate ability could visualize us practically in toto. I\nassume, however, that this possibility has been taken into\nconsideration, and suggest that the membership be informed.\"\n\n\"The point is well taken. The possibility exists. While the probability\nis very great that such an analysis will not be made until after we have\ndeclared ourselves, it is not a certainty. Immediately upon deducing our\nexistence, however, the Eddorians would begin to build against us, upon\nthe four planets and elsewhere. Since there is only one effective\ncounter-structure possible, and since we Elders have long been alert to\ndetect the first indications of that particular activity, we know that\nthe situation remains unchanged. If it changes, we will call at once\nanother full meeting of minds. Are there any other matters of moment...?\nIf not, this conference will dissolve.\"\n\n\n3. ATLANTIS\n\nAriponides, recently elected Faros of Atlantis for his third five-year\nterm, stood at a window of his office atop the towering Farostery. His\nhands were clasped loosely behind his back. He did not really see the\ntremendous expanse of quiet ocean, nor the bustling harbor, nor the\nmetropolis spread out so magnificently and so busily beneath him. He\nstood there, motionless, until a subtle vibration warned him that\nvisitors were approaching his door.\n\n\"Come in, gentlemen.... Please be seated.\" He sat down at one end of a\ntable molded of transparent plastic. \"Psychologist Talmonides, Statesman\nCleto, Minister Philamon, Minister Marxes and Officer Artomenes, I have\nasked you to come here personally because I have every reason to believe\nthat the shielding of this room is proof against eavesdroppers; a thing\nwhich can no longer be said of our supposedly private television\nchannels. We must discuss, and if possible come to some decision\nconcerning, the state in which our nation now finds itself.\n\n\"Each of us knows within himself exactly what he is. Of our own powers,\nwe cannot surely know each others' inward selves. The tools and\ntechniques of psychology, however, are potent and exact; and Talmonides,\nafter exhaustive and rigorous examination of each one of us, has\ncertified that no taint of disloyalty exists among us.\"\n\n\"Which certification is not worth a damn,\" the burly Officer declared.\n\"What assurance do we have that Talmonides himself is not one of the\nringleaders? Mind you, I have no reason to believe that he is not\ncompletely loyal. In fact, since he has been one of my best friends for\nover twenty years, I believe implicitly that he is. Nevertheless the\nplain fact is, Ariponides, that all the precautions you have taken, and\nany you can take, are and will be useless insofar as definite knowledge\nis concerned. The real truth is and will remain unknown.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" the Psychologist conceded. \"And, such being the case,\nperhaps I should withdraw from the meeting.\"\n\n\"That wouldn't help, either.\" Artomenes shook his head. \"Any competent\nplotter would be prepared for this, as for any other contingency. One of\nus others would be the real operator.\"\n\n\"And the fact that our Officer is the one who is splitting hairs so\nfinely could be taken to indicate which one of us the real operator\ncould be,\" Marxes pointed out, cuttingly.\n\n\"Gentlemen! Gentlemen!\" Ariponides protested. \"While absolute certainty\nis of course impossible to any finite mind, you all know how Talmonides\nwas tested; you know that in his case there is no reasonable doubt. Such\nchance as exists, however, must be taken, for if we do not trust each\nother fully in this undertaking, failure is inevitable. With this word\nof warning I will get on with my report.\n\n\"This worldwide frenzy of unrest followed closely upon the controlled\nliberation of atomic energy and may be--probably is--traceable to it. It\nis in no part due to imperialistic aims or acts on the part of Atlantis.\nThis fact cannot be stressed too strongly. We never have been and are\nnot now interested in Empire. It is true that the other nations began as\nAtlantean colonies, but no attempt was ever made to hold any one of them\nin colonial status against the wish of its electorate. All nations were\nand are sister states. We gain or lose together. Atlantis, the parent,\nwas and is a clearing-house, a co-ordinator of effort, but has never\nclaimed or sought authority to rule; all decisions being based upon free\ndebate and free and secret ballot.\n\n\"But now! Parties and factions everywhere, even in old Atlantis. Every\nnation is torn by internal dissensions and strife. Nor is this all.\nUighar as a nation is insensately jealous of the Islands of the South,\nwho in turn are jealous of Maya. Maya of Bantu, Bantu of Ekopt, Ekopt of\nNorheim, and Norheim of Uighar. A vicious circle, worsened by other\njealousies and hatreds intercrossing everywhere. Each fears that some\nother is about to try to seize control of the entire world; and there\nseems to be spreading rapidly the utterly baseless belief that Atlantis\nitself is about to reduce all other nations of Earth to vassalage.\n\n\"This is a bald statement of the present condition of the world as I see\nit. Since I can see no other course possible within the constituted\nframework of our democratic government, I recommend that we continue our\npresent activities, such as the international treaties and agreements\nupon which we are now at work, intensifying our effort wherever\npossible. We will now hear from Statesman Cleto.\"\n\n\"You have outlined the situation clearly enough, Faros. My thought,\nhowever, is that the principal cause of the trouble is the coming into\nbeing of this multiplicity of political parties, particularly those\ncomposed principally of crackpots and extremists. The connection with\natomic energy is clear: since the atomic bomb gives a small group of\npeople the power to destroy the world, they reason that it thereby\nconfers upon them the authority to dictate to the world. My\nrecommendation is merely a special case of yours; that every effort be\nmade to influence the electorates of Norheim and of Uighar into\nsupporting an effective international control of atomic energy.\"\n\n\"You have your data tabulated in symbolics?\" asked Talmonides, from his\nseat at the keyboard of a calculating machine.\n\n\"Yes. Here they are.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\n\"Minister Philamon,\" the Faros announced.\n\n\"As I see it--as any intelligent man should be able to see it--the\nprincipal contribution of atomic energy to this worldwide chaos was the\ncomplete demoralization of labor,\" the gray-haired Minister of Trade\nstated, flatly. \"Output per man-hour should have gone up at least twenty\npercent, in which case prices would automatically have come down.\nInstead, short-sighted guilds imposed drastic curbs on production, and\nnow seem to be surprised that as production falls and hourly wages rise,\nprices also rise and real income drops. Only one course is possible,\ngentlemen; labor _must_ be made to listen to reason. This\nfeather-bedding, this protected loafing, this....\"\n\n\"I protest!\" Marxes, Minister of Work, leaped to his feet. \"The blame\nlies squarely with the capitalists. Their greed, their rapacity, their\nexploitation of....\"\n\n\"One moment, please!\" Ariponides rapped the table sharply. \"It is highly\nsignificant of the deplorable condition of the times that two Ministers\nof State should speak as you two have just spoken. I take it that\nneither of you has anything new to contribute to this symposium?\"\n\nBoth claimed the floor, but both were refused it by vote.\n\n\"Hand your tabulated data to Talmonides,\" the Faros directed. \"Officer\nArtomenes?\"\n\n\"You, our Faros, have more than intimated that our defense program, for\nwhich I am primarily responsible, has been largely to blame for what has\nhappened,\" the grizzled warrior began. \"In part, perhaps it was--one\nmust be blind indeed not to see the connection, and biased indeed not to\nadmit it. But what should I have done, knowing that there is no\npractical defense against the atomic bomb? Every nation has them, and is\nmanufacturing more and more. Every nation is infested with the agents of\nevery other. Should I have tried to keep Atlantis toothless in a world\nbristling with fangs? And could I--or anyone else--have succeeded in\ndoing so?\"\n\n\"Probably not. No criticism was intended; we must deal with the\nsituation as it actually exists. Your recommendations, please?\"\n\n\"I have thought this thing over day and night, and can see no solution\nwhich can be made acceptable to our--or to any real--democracy.\nNevertheless, I have one recommendation to make. We all know that\nNorheim and Uighar are the sore spots--particularly Norheim. We have\nmore bombs as of now than both of them together. We know that Uighar's\nsuper-sonic jobs are ready. We don't know exactly what Norheim has,\nsince they cut my Intelligence line a while back, but I'm sending over\nanother operative--my best man, too--tonight. If he finds out that we\nhave enough advantage in speed, and I'm pretty sure that we have, I say\nhit both Norheim and Uighar right then, while we can, before they hit\nus. And hit them hard--pulverize them. Then set up a world government\nstrong enough to knock out any nation--including Atlantis--that will not\ncooperate with it. This course of action is flagrantly against all\ninternational law and all the principles of democracy, I know; and even\nit might not work. It is, however, as far as I can see, the only course\nwhich _can_ work.\"\n\n\"You--we all--perceive its weaknesses.\" The Faros thought for minutes.\n\"You cannot be sure that your Intelligence has located all of the danger\npoints, and many of them must be so far underground as to be safe from\neven our heaviest missiles. We all, including you, believe that the\nPsychologist is right in holding that the reaction of the other nations\nto such action would be both unfavorable and violent. Your report,\nplease, Talmonides.\"\n\n\"I have already put my data into the integrator.\" The Psychologist\npunched a button and the mechanism began to whir and to click. \"I have\nonly one new fact of any importance; the name of one of the higher-ups\nand its corollary implication that there may be some degree of\ncooperation between Norheim and Uighar....\"\n\nHe broke off as the machine stopped clicking and ejected its report.\n\n\"Look at that graph--up ten points in seven days!\" Talmonides pointed a\nfinger. \"The situation is deteriorating faster and faster. The\nconclusion is unavoidable--you can see yourselves that this summation\nline is fast approaching unity--that the outbreaks will become\nuncontrollable in approximately eight days. With one slight\nexception--here--you will notice that the lines of organization and\npurpose are as random as ever. In spite of this conclusive integration I\nwould be tempted to believe that this seeming lack of coherence was due\nto insufficient data--that back of this whole movement there is a\ncarefully-set-up and completely-integrated plan--except for the fact\nthat the factions and the nations are so evenly matched. But the data\nare sufficient. It is shown conclusively that no one of the other\nnations can possibly win, even by totally destroying Atlantis. They\nwould merely destroy each other and our entire Civilization. According\nto this forecast, in arriving at which the data furnished by our Officer\nwere prime determinants, that will surely be the outcome unless remedial\nmeasures be taken at once. You are of course sure of your facts,\nArtomenes?\"\n\n\"I am sure. But you said you had a name, and that it indicated a\nNorheim-Uighar hookup. What is that name?\"\n\n\"An old friend of yours....\"\n\n\"Lo Sung!\" The words as spoken were a curse of fury.\n\n\"None other. And, unfortunately, there is as yet no course of action\nindicated which is at all promising of success.\"\n\n\"Use mine, then!\" Artomenes jumped up and banged the table with his\nfist. \"Let me send two flights of rockets over right now that will blow\nUigharstoy and Norgrad into radioactive dust and make a thousand square\nmiles around each of them uninhabitable for ten thousand years! If\nthat's the only way they can learn anything, let them learn!\"\n\n\"Sit down, Officer,\" Ariponides directed, quietly. \"That course, as you\nhave already pointed out, is indefensible. It violates every Prime Basic\nof our Civilization. Moreover, it would be entirely futile, since this\nresultant makes it clear that every nation on Earth would be destroyed\nwithin the day.\"\n\n\"What, then?\" Artomenes demanded, bitterly. \"Sit still here and let them\nannihilate us?\"\n\n\"Not necessarily. It is to formulate plans that we are here. Talmonides\nwill by now have decided, upon the basis of our pooled knowledge, what\nmust be done.\"\n\n\"The outlook is not good: not good at all,\" the Psychologist announced,\ngloomily. \"The only course of action which carries any promise whatever\nof success--and its probability is only point one eight--is the one\nrecommended by the Faros, modified slightly to include Artomenes'\nsuggestion of sending his best operative on the indicated mission. For\nhighest morale, by the way, the Faros should also interview this agent\nbefore he sets out. Ordinarily I would not advocate a course of action\nhaving so little likelihood of success; but since it is simply a\ncontinuation and intensification of what we are already doing, I do not\nsee how we can adopt any other.\"\n\n\"Are we agreed?\" Ariponides asked, after a short silence.\n\nThey were agreed. Four of the conferees filed out and a brisk young man\nstrode in. Although he did not look at the Faros his eyes asked\nquestions.\n\n\"Reporting for orders, sir.\" He saluted the Officer punctiliously.\n\n\"At ease, sir.\" Artomenes returned the salute. \"You were called here for\na word from the Faros. Sir, I present Captain Phryges.\"\n\n\"Not orders, son ... no.\" Ariponides' right hand rested in greeting upon\nthe captain's left shoulder, wise old eyes probed deeply into\ngold-flecked, tawny eyes of youth; the Faros saw, without really\nnoticing, a flaming thatch of red-bronze-auburn hair. \"I asked you here\nto wish you well; not only for myself, but for all our nation and\nperhaps for our entire race. While everything in my being rebels against\nan unprovoked and unannounced assault, we may be compelled to choose\nbetween our Officer's plan of campaign and the destruction of\nCivilization. Since you already know the vital importance of your\nmission, I need not enlarge upon it. But I want you to know fully,\nCaptain Phryges, that all Atlantis flies with you this night.\"\n\n\"Th ... thank you, sir.\" Phryges gulped twice to steady his voice. \"I'll\ndo my best, sir.\"\n\nAnd later, in a wingless craft flying toward the airfield, young Phryges\nbroke a long silence. \"So _that_ is the Faros ... I like him, Officer\n... I have never seen him close up before ... there's something about\nhim.... He isn't like my father, much, but it seems as though I have\nknown him for a thousand years!\"\n\n\"Hm ... m ... m. Peculiar. You two are a lot alike, at that, even though\nyou don't look anything like each other. ... Can't put a finger on\nexactly what it is, but it's there.\" Although Artomenes nor any other of\nhis time could place it, the resemblance was indeed there. It was in and\nback of the eyes; it was the \"look of eagles\" which was long later to\nbecome associated with the wearers of Arisia's Lens. \"But here we are,\nand your ship's ready. Luck, son.\"\n\n\"Thanks, sir. But one more thing. If it should--if I don't get\nback--will you see that my wife and the baby are...?\"\n\n\"I will, son. They will leave for North Maya tomorrow morning. They will\nlive, whether you and I do or not. Anything else?\"\n\n\"No, sir. Thanks. Goodbye.\"\n\nThe ship was a tremendous flying wing. A standard commercial job.\nEmpty--passengers, even crewmen, were never subjected to the brutal\naccelerations regularly used by unmanned carriers. Phryges scanned the\npanel. Tiny motors were pulling tapes through the controllers. Every\nlight showed green. Everything was set. Donning a water-proof coverall,\nhe slid through a flexible valve into his acceleration-tank and waited.\n\nA siren yelled briefly. Black night turned blinding white as the\nharnessed energies of the atom were released. For five and six-tenths\nseconds the sharp, hard, beryllium-bronze leading edge of the\nback-sweeping V sliced its way through ever-thinning air.\n\nThe vessel seemed to pause momentarily; paused and bucked viciously. She\nshuddered and shivered, tried to tear herself into shreds and chunks;\nbut Phryges in his tank was unconcerned. Earlier, weaker ships went to\npieces against the solid-seeming wall of atmospheric incompressibility\nat the velocity of sound; but this one was built solidly enough, and\npowered to hit that wall hard enough, to go through unharmed.\n\nThe hellish vibration ceased; the fantastic violence of the drive\nsubsided to a mere shove; Phryges knew that the vessel had leveled off\nat its cruising speed of two thousand miles per hour. He emerged,\nspilling the least possible amount of water upon the polished steel\nfloor. He took off his coverall and stuffed it back through the valve\ninto the tank. He mopped and polished the floor with towels, which\nlikewise went into the tank.\n\nHe drew on a pair of soft gloves and, by manual control, jettisoned the\nacceleration tank and all the apparatus which had made that unloading\npossible. This junk would fall into the ocean; would sink; would never\nbe found. He examined the compartment and the hatch minutely. No\nscratches, no scars, no mars; no tell-tale marks or prints of any kind.\nLet the Norskies search. So far, so good.\n\nBack toward the trailing edge then, to a small escape-hatch beside which\nwas fastened a dull black ball. The anchoring devices went out first. He\ngasped as the air rushed out into near-vacuum, but he had been trained\nto take sudden and violent fluctuations in pressure. He rolled the ball\nout upon the hatch, where he opened it; two hinged hemispheres, each\nheavily padded with molded composition resembling sponge rubber. It\nseemed incredible that a man as big as Phryges, especially when wearing\na parachute, could be crammed into a space so small; but that lining had\nbeen molded to fit.\n\nThis ball _had_ to be small. The ship, even though it was on a\nregularly-scheduled commercial flight, would be scanned intensively and\ncontinuously from the moment of entering Norheiman radar range. Since\nthe ball would be invisible on any radar screen, no suspicion would be\naroused; particularly since--as far as Atlantean Intelligence had been\nable to discover--the Norheimans had not yet succeeded in perfecting any\ndevice by the use of which a living man could bail out of a super-sonic\nplane.\n\nPhryges waited--and waited--until the second hand of his watch marked\nthe arrival of zero time. He curled up into one half of the ball; the\nother half closed over him and locked. The hatch opened. Ball and\nclosely-prisoned man plummeted downward; slowing abruptly, with a\nhorrible deceleration, to terminal velocity. Had the air been any trifle\nthicker the Atlantean captain would have died then and there; but that,\ntoo, had been computed accurately and Phryges lived.\n\nAnd as the ball bulleted downward on a screaming slant, it _shrank_!\n\nThis, too, the Atlanteans hoped, was new--a synthetic which air-friction\nwould erode away, molecule by molecule, so rapidly that no perceptible\nfragment of it would reach ground.\n\nThe casing disappeared, and the yielding porous lining. And Phryges,\nstill at an altitude of over thirty thousand feet, kicked away the\nremaining fragments of his cocoon and, by judicious planning, turned\nhimself so that he could see the ground, now dimly visible in the first\ndull gray of dawn. There was the highway, paralleling his line of\nflight; he wouldn't miss it more than a hundred yards.\n\nHe fought down an almost overwhelming urge to pull his rip-cord too\nsoon. He had to wait--wait until the last possible second--because\nparachutes were big and Norheiman radar practically swept the ground.\n\nLow enough at last, he pulled the ring. Z-r-r-e-e-k--WHAP! The chute\nbanged open; his harness tightened with a savage jerk, mere seconds\nbefore his hard-sprung knees took the shock of landing.\n\nThat was close--too close! He was white and shaking, but unhurt, as he\ngathered in the billowing, fighting sheet and rolled it, together with\nhis harness, into a wad. He broke open a tiny ampoule, and as the drops\nof liquid touched it the stout fabric began to disappear. It did not\nburn; it simply disintegrated and vanished. In less than a minute there\nremained only a few steel snaps and rings, which the Atlantean buried\nunder a meticulously-replaced circle of sod.\n\nHe was still on schedule. In less than three minutes the signals would\nbe on the air and he would know where he was--unless the Norsks had\nsucceeded in finding and eliminating the whole Atlantean under-cover\ngroup. He pressed a stud on a small instrument; held it down. A line\nburned green across the dial--flared red--vanished.\n\n\"Damn!\" he breathed, explosively. The strength of the signal told him\nthat he was within a mile or so of the hide-out--first-class\ncomputation--but the red flash warned him to keep away. Kinnexa--_it had\nbetter be Kinnexa!_--would come to him.\n\nHow? By air? Along the road? Through the woods on foot? He had no way of\nknowing--talking, even on a tight beam, was out of the question. He made\nhis way to the highway and crouched behind a tree. Here she could come\nat him by any route of the three. Again he waited, pressing infrequently\na stud of his sender.\n\nA long, low-slung ground-car swung around the curve and Phryges'\nbinoculars were at his eyes. It was Kinnexa--or a duplicate. At the\nthought he dropped his glasses and pulled his guns--blaster in right\nhand, air-pistol in left. But no, that wouldn't do. She'd be suspicious,\ntoo--she'd have to be--and that car probably mounted heavy stuff. If he\nstepped out ready for business she'd fry him, and quick. Maybe not--she\nmight have protection--but he couldn't take the chance.\n\nThe car slowed; stopped. The girl got out, examined a front tire,\nstraightened up, and looked down the road, straight at Phryges' hiding\nplace. This time the binoculars brought her up to little more than arm's\nlength. Tall, blonde, beautifully built; the slightly crooked left\neyebrow. The thread-line of gold betraying a one-tooth bridge and the\ntiny scar on her upper lip, for both of which he had been\nresponsible--she always did insist on playing cops-and-robbers with boys\nolder and bigger than herself--it _was_ Kinnexa! Not even Norheim's\nscience could imitate so perfectly every personalizing characteristic of\na girl he had known ever since she was knee-high to a duck!\n\nThe girl slid back into her seat and the heavy car began to move.\nOpen-handed, Phryges stepped out into its way. The car stopped.\n\n\"Turn around. Back up to me, hands behind you,\" she directed, crisply.\n\nThe man, although surprised, obeyed. Not until he felt a finger\nexploring the short hair at the back of his neck did he realize what she\nwas seeking--the almost imperceptible scar marking the place where she\nbit him when she was seven years old!\n\n\"Oh, Fry! It _is_ you! _Really_ you! Thank the gods! I've been ashamed\nof that all my life, but now....\"\n\nHe whirled and caught her as she slumped, but she did not quite faint.\n\n\"Quick! Get in ... drive on ... not too fast!\" she cautioned, sharply,\nas the tires began to scream. \"The speed limit along here is seventy,\nand we can't be picked up.\"\n\n\"Easy it is, Kinny. But _give_! What's the score? Where's Kolanides? Or\nrather, what happened to him?\"\n\n\"Dead. So are the others, I think. They put him on a psycho-bench and\nturned him inside out.\"\n\n\"But the blocks?\"\n\n\"Didn't hold--over here they add such trimmings as skinning and salt to\nthe regular psycho routine. But none of them knew anything about me, nor\nabout how their reports were picked up, or I'd have been dead, too. But\nit doesn't make any difference, Fry--we're just one week too late.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, too late? Speed it up!\" His tone was rough, but the\nhand he placed on her arm was gentleness itself.\n\n\"I'm telling you as fast as I can. I picked up his last report day\nbefore yesterday. They have missiles just as big and just as fast as\nours--maybe more so--and they are going to fire one at Atlantis tonight\nat exactly seven o'clock.\"\n\n\"Tonight! Holy gods!\" The man's mind raced.\n\n\"Yes.\" Kinnexa's voice was low, uninflected. \"And there was nothing in\nthe world that I could do about it. If I approached any one of our\nplaces, or tried to use a beam strong enough to reach anywhere, I would\nsimply have got picked up, too. I've thought and thought, but could\nfigure out only one thing that might possibly be of any use, and I\ncouldn't do that alone. But two of us, perhaps....\"\n\n\"Go on. Brief me. Nobody ever accused you of not having a brain, and you\nknow this whole country like the palm of your hand.\"\n\n\"Steal a ship. Be over the ramp at exactly Seven Pay Emma. When the lid\nopens, go into a full-power dive, beam Artomenes--if I had a second\nbefore they blanketed my wave--and meet their rocket head-on in their\nown launching-tube.\"\n\nThis was stark stuff, but so tense was the moment and so highly keyed up\nwere the two that neither of them saw anything out of the ordinary in\nit.\n\n\"Not bad, if we can't figure out anything better. The joker being, of\ncourse, that you didn't see how you could steal a ship?\"\n\n\"Exactly. I can't carry blasters. No woman in Norheim is wearing a coat\nor a cloak now, so I can't either. And just look at this dress! Do you\nsee any place where I could hide even one?\"\n\nHe looked, appreciatively, and she had the grace to blush.\n\n\"Can't say that I do,\" he admitted. \"But I'd rather have one of our own\nships, if we could make the approach. Could both of us make it, do you\nsuppose?\"\n\n\"Not a chance. They'd keep at least one man inside all the time. Even if\nwe killed everybody outside, the ship would take off before we could get\nclose enough to open the port with the outside controls.\"\n\n\"Probably. Go on. But first, are you sure that you're in the clear?\"\n\n\"Positive.\" She grinned mirthlessly. \"The fact that I am still alive is\nconclusive evidence that they didn't find out anything about me. But I\ndon't want you to work on that idea if you can think of a better one.\nI've got passports and so on for you to be anything you want to be, from\na tube-man up to an Ekoptian banker. Ditto for me, and for us both, as\nMr. and Mrs.\"\n\n\"Smart girl.\" He thought for minutes, then shook his head. \"No possible\nway out that I can see. The sneak-boat isn't due for a week, and from\nwhat you've said it probably won't get here. But you might make it, at\nthat. I'll drop you somewhere....\"\n\n\"You will not,\" she interrupted, quietly but definitely. \"Which would\n_you_ rather--go out in a blast like that one will be, beside a good\nAtlantean, or, after deserting him, be psychoed, skinned, salted,\nand--still alive--drawn and quartered?\"\n\n\"Together, then, all the way,\" he assented. \"Man and wife.\nTourists--newlyweds--from some town not too far away. Pretty well fixed,\nto match what we're riding in. Can do?\"\n\n\"Very simple.\" She opened a compartment and selected one of a stack of\ndocuments. \"I can fix this one up in ten minutes. We'll have to dispose\nof the rest of these, and a lot of other stuff, too. And you had better\nget out of that leather and into a suit that matches this passport\nphoto.\"\n\n\"Right. Straight road for miles, and nothing in sight either way. Give\nme the suit and I'll change now. Keep on going or stop?\"\n\n\"Better stop, I think,\" the girl decided. \"Quicker, and we'll have to\nfind a place to hide or bury this evidence.\"\n\nWhile the man changed clothes, Kinnexa collected the contraband,\nwrapping it up in the discarded jacket. She looked up just as Phryges\nwas adjusting his coat. She glanced at his armpits, then stared.\n\n\"Where are your blasters?\" she demanded. \"They ought to show, at least a\nlittle, and even I can't see a sign of them.\"\n\nHe showed her.\n\n\"But they're so tiny! I never saw blasters like that!\"\n\n\"I've got a blaster, but it's in the tail pocket. These aren't. They're\nair-guns. Poisoned needles. Not worth a damn beyond a hundred feet, but\ndeadly close up. One touch anywhere and the guy dies right then. Two\nseconds max.\"\n\n\"Nice!\" She was no shrinking violet this young Atlantean spy. \"You have\nspares, of course, and I can hide two of them easily enough in\nleg-holsters. Gimme, and show me how they work.\"\n\n\"Standard controls, pretty much like blasters. Like so.\" He\ndemonstrated, and as he drove sedately down the highway the girl sewed\nindustriously.\n\nThe day wore on, nor was it uneventful. One incident, in fact--the\ndetailing of which would serve no useful purpose here--was of such a\nnature that at its end:\n\n\"Better pin-point me, don't you think, on that ramp?\" Phryges asked,\nquietly. \"Just in case you get scragged in one of these brawls and I\ndon't?\"\n\n\"Oh! Of course! Forgive me, Fry--it slipped my mind completely that you\ndidn't know where it was. Area six; pin-point four seven three dash six\noh five.\n\n\"Got it.\" He repeated the figures.\n\nBut neither of the Atlanteans was \"scragged\", and at six P.M. an\nallegedly honeymooning couple parked their big roadster in the garage at\nNorgrad Field and went through the gates. Their papers, tickets\nincluded, were in perfect order; they were as inconspicuous and as\nundemonstrative as newlyweds are wont to be. No more so, and no less.\n\nStrolling idly, gazing eagerly at each new thing, they made their\ncircuitous way toward a certain small hangar. As the girl had said, this\nfield boasted hundreds of super-sonic fighters, so many that servicing\nwas a round-the-clock routine. In that hangar was a sharp-nosed,\nstubby-V'd flyer, one of Norheim's fastest. It was serviced and ready.\n\nIt was too much to hope, of course, that the visitors could actually get\ninto the building unchallenged. Nor did they.\n\n\"Back, you!\" A guard waved them away. \"Get back to the Concourse, where\nyou belong--no visitors allowed out here!\"\n\nF-f-t! F-f-t! Phryges' air-gun broke into soft but deadly coughing.\nKinnexa whirled--hands flashing down, skirt flying up-and ran. Guards\ntried to head her off; tried to bring their own weapons to bear.\nTried--failed--died.\n\nPhryges, too, ran; ran backward. His blaster was out now and flaming,\nfor no living enemy remained within needle range. A rifle bullet\nw-h-i-n-g-e-d past his head, making him duck involuntarily and\nuselessly. Rifles were bad; but their hazard, too, had been considered\nand had been accepted.\n\nKinnexa reached the fighter's port, opened it, sprang in. He jumped. She\nfell against him. He tossed her clear, slammed and dogged the door. He\nlooked at her then, and swore bitterly. A small, round hole marred the\nbridge of her nose: the back of her head was gone.\n\nHe leaped to the controls and the fleet little ship screamed skyward. He\ncut in transmitter and receiver, keyed and twiddled briefly. No soap. He\nhad been afraid of that. They were already blanketing every frequency he\ncould employ; using power through which he could not drive even a tight\nbeam a hundred miles.\n\nBut he could still crash that missile in its tube. Or--could he? He was\nnot afraid of other Norheiman fighters; he had a long lead and he rode\none of their very fastest. But since they were already so suspicious,\nwouldn't they launch the bomb _before_ seven o'clock? He tried vainly to\ncoax another knot out of his wide-open engines.\n\nWith all his speed, he neared the pin-point just in time to see a trail\nof super-heated vapor extending up into and disappearing beyond the\nstratosphere. He nosed his flyer upward, locked the missile into his\nsights, and leveled off. Although his ship did not have the giant\nrocket's acceleration, he could catch it before it got to Atlantis,\nsince he did not need its altitude and since most of its journey would\nbe made without power. What he could do about it after he caught it he\ndid not know, but he'd do _something_.\n\nHe caught it; and, by a feat of piloting to be appreciated only by those\nwho have handled planes at super-sonic speeds, he matched its course and\nvelocity. Then, from a distance of barely a hundred feet, he poured his\nheaviest shells into the missile's war-head. He _couldn't_ be missing!\nIt was worse than shooting sitting ducks--it was like dynamiting fish in\na bucket! Nevertheless, nothing happened. The thing wasn't fuzed for\nimpact, then, but for time; and the activating mechanism would be\nshell-and shock-proof.\n\nBut there was still a way. He didn't need to call Artomenes now, even if\nhe could get through the interference which the fast-approaching\npursuers were still sending out. Atlantean observers would have lined\nthis stuff up long since; the Officer would know exactly what was going\non.\n\nDriving ahead and downward, at maximum power, Phryges swung his ship\nslowly into a right-angle collision course. The fighter's needle nose\nstruck the war-head within a foot of the Atlantean's point of aim, and\nas he died Phryges knew that he had accomplished his mission. Norheim's\nmissile would not strike Atlantis, but would fall at least ten miles\nshort, and the water there was very deep. Very, _very_ deep. Atlantis\nwould not be harmed.\n\nIt might have been better, however, if Phryges had died with Kinnexa on\nNorgrad Field; in which case the continent would probably have endured.\nAs it was, while that one missile did not reach the city, its frightful\natomic charge exploded under six hundred fathoms of water, ten scant\nmiles from Atlantis' harbor, and very close to an ancient geological\nfault.\n\nArtomenes, as Phryges had surmised, had had time in which to act, and he\nknew much more than Phryges did about what was coming toward Atlantis.\nToo late, he knew that not one missile, but seven, had been launched\nfrom Norheim, and at least five from Uighar. The retaliatory rockets\nwhich were to wipe out Norgrad, Uigharstoy, and thousands of square\nmiles of environs were on their way long before either bomb or\nearthquake destroyed all of the Atlantean launching ramps.\n\nBut when equilibrium was at last restored, the ocean rolled serenely\nwhere a minor continent had been.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nTHE FALL OF ROME\n\n1. EDDORE\n\n\nLike two high executives of a Tellurian corporation discussing business\naffairs during a chance meeting at one of their clubs, Eddore's All\nHighest and Gharlane, his second in command, were having the Eddorian\nequivalent of an after-business-hours chat.\n\n\"You did a nice job on Tellus,\" the All-Highest commended. \"On the other\nthree, too, of course, but Tellus was so far and away the worst of the\nlot that the excellence of the work stands out. When the Atlantean\nnations destroyed each other so thoroughly I thought that this thing\ncalled 'democracy' was done away with forever, but it seems to be mighty\nhard to kill. However, I take it that you have this Rome situation\nentirely under control?\"\n\n\"Definitely. Mithradates of Pontus was mine. So were both Sulla and\nMarius. Through them and others I killed practically all of the brains\nand ability of Rome, and reduced that so-called 'democracy' to a\nhowling, aimless mob. My Nero will end it. Rome will go on by\nmomentum--outwardly, will even appear to grow--for a few generations,\nbut what Nero will do can never be undone.\"\n\n\"Good. A difficult task, truly.\"\n\n\"Not difficult, exactly ... but it's so damned _steady_.\" Gharlane's\nthought was bitter. \"But that's the hell of working with such\nshort-lived races. Since each creature lives only a minute or so, they\nchange so fast that a man can't take his mind off of them for a second.\nI've been wanting to take a little vacation trip back to our old\ntime-space, but it doesn't look as though I'll be able to do it until\nafter they get some age and settle down.\"\n\n\"That won't be too long. Life-spans lengthen, you know, as races\napproach their norms.\"\n\n\"Yes. But none of the others is having half the trouble that I am. Most\nof them, in fact, have things coming along just about the way they want\nthem. My four planets are raising more hell than all the rest of both\ngalaxies put together, and I know that it isn't me--next to you, I'm the\nmost efficient operator we've got. What I'm wondering about is why I\nhappen to be the goat.\"\n\n\"Precisely because you _are_ our most efficient operator.\" If an\nEddorian can be said to smile, the All-Highest smiled. \"You know, as\nwell as I do, the findings of the Integrator.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I am wondering more and more as to whether to believe them\nunreservedly or not. Spores from an extinct life-form--suitable\nenvironments--operation of the laws of chance--Tommyrot! I am beginning\nto suspect that chance is being strained beyond its elastic limit, for\nmy particular benefit, and as soon as I can find out who is doing that\nstraining there will be one empty place in the Innermost Circle.\"\n\n\"Have a care, Gharlane!\" All levity, all casualness disappeared. \"Whom\ndo you suspect? Whom do you accuse?\"\n\n\"Nobody, as yet. The true angle never occurred to me until just now,\nwhile I have been discussing the thing with you. Nor shall I either\nsuspect or accuse, ever. I shall determine, then I shall act.\"\n\n\"In defiance of _me_? Of _my_ orders?\" the All-Highest demanded, his\nshort temper flaring.\n\n\"Say, rather, in support,\" the lieutenant shot back, unabashed. \"If some\none is working on me through my job, what position are you probably\nalready in, without knowing it? Assume that I am right, that these four\nplanets of mine got the way they are because of monkey business inside\nthe Circle. Who would be next? And how sure are you that there isn't\nsomething similar, but not so far advanced, already aimed at you? It\nseems to me that serious thought is in order.\"\n\n\"Perhaps so.... You may be right.... There have been a few\nnonconformable items. Taken separately, they did not seem to be of any\nimportance; but together, and considered in this new light....\"\n\nThus was borne out the conclusion of the Arisian Elders that the\nEddorians would not at that time deduce Arisia; and thus Eddore lost its\nchance to begin in time the forging of a weapon with which to oppose\neffectively Arisia's--Civilization's--Galactic Patrol, so soon to come\ninto being.\n\nIf either of the two had been less suspicious, less jealous, less\narrogant and domineering--in other words, had not been Eddorians--this\nHistory of Civilization might never have been written; or written very\ndifferently and by another hand.\n\nBoth were, however, Eddorians.\n\n\n2. ARISIA\n\nIn the brief interval between the fall of Atlantis and the rise of Rome\nto the summit of her power, Eukonidor of Arisia had aged scarcely at\nall. He was still a youth. He was, and would be for many centuries to\ncome, a Watchman. Although his mind was powerful enough to understand\nthe Elders' visualization of the course of Civilization--in fact, he had\nalready made significant progress in his own visualization of the Cosmic\nAll--he was not sufficiently mature to contemplate unmoved the events\nwhich, according to all Arisian visualizations, were bound to occur.\n\n\"Your feeling is but natural, Eukonidor.\" Drounli, the Moulder\nprincipally concerned with the planet Tellus, meshed his mind smoothly\nwith that of the young Watchman. \"We do not enjoy it ourselves, as you\nknow. It is, however, _necessary_. In no other way can the ultimate\ntriumph of Civilization be assured.\"\n\n\"But can nothing be done to alleviate...?\" Eukonidor paused.\n\nDrounli waited. \"Have you any suggestions to offer?\"\n\n\"None,\" the younger Arisian confessed. \"But I thought ... you, or the\nElders, so much older and stronger ... could....\"\n\n\"We can not. Rome will fall. It must be allowed to fall.\"\n\n\"It will be Nero, then? And we can do nothing?\"\n\n\"Nero. We can do little enough. Our forms of flesh--Petronius, Acte, and\nthe others--will do whatever they can; but their powers will be exactly\nthe same as those of other human beings of their time. They must be and\nwill be constrained, since any show of unusual powers, either mental or\nphysical, would be detected instantly and would be far too revealing. On\nthe other hand, Nero--that is, Gharlane of Eddore--will be operating\nmuch more freely.\"\n\n\"Very much so. Practically unhampered, except in purely physical\nmatters. But, if nothing can be done to stop it.... If Nero must be\nallowed to sow his seeds of ruin....\"\n\nAnd upon that cheerless note the conference ended.\n\n\n3. ROME\n\n\"But what have you, Livius, or any of us, for that matter, got to live\nfor?\" demanded Patroclus the gladiator of his cell-mate. \"We are well\nfed, well kept, well exercised; like horses. But, like horses, we are\nlower than slaves. Slaves have some freedom of action; most of us have\nnone. We fight--fight whoever or whatever our cursed owners send us\nagainst. Those of us who live fight again; but the end is certain and\ncomes soon. I had a wife and children once. So did you. Is there any\nchance, however slight, that either of us will ever know them again; or\nlearn even whether they live or die? None. At this price, is your life\nworth living? Mine is not.\"\n\nLivius the Bithynian, who had been staring out past the bars of the\ncubicle and over the smooth sand of the arena toward Nero's garlanded\nand purple-bannered throne, turned and studied his fellow gladiator from\ntoe to crown. The heavily-muscled legs, the narrow waist, the\nsharply-tapering torso, the enormous shoulders. The leonine head,\nsurmounted by an unkempt shock of red-bronze-auburn hair. And, lastly,\nthe eyes--gold-flecked, tawny eyes--hard and cold now with a ferocity\nand a purpose not to be concealed.\n\n\"I have been more or less expecting something of this sort,\" Livius said\nthen, quietly. \"Nothing overt--you have builded well, Patroclus--but to\none who knows gladiators as I know them there has been something in the\nwind for weeks past. I take it that someone swore his life for me and\nthat I should not ask who that friend might be.\"\n\n\"One did. You should not.\"\n\n\"So be it. To my unknown sponsor, then, and to the gods, I give thanks,\nfor I am wholly with you. Not that I have any hope. Although your tribe\nbreeds men--from your build and hair and eyes you descend from\nSpartacus himself--you know that even he did not succeed. Things now are\nworse, infinitely worse, than they were in his day. No one who has ever\nplotted against Nero has had any measure of success; not even his\nscheming slut of a mother. All have died, in what fashions you know.\nNero is vile, the basest of the base. Nevertheless, his spies are the\nmost efficient that the world has ever known. In spite of that, I feel\nas you do. If I can take with me two or three of the Praetorians, I die\ncontent. But by your look, your plan is not what I thought, to storm\nvainly Nero's podium yonder. Have you, by any chance, some trace of hope\nof success?\"\n\n\"More than a trace; much more.\" The Thracian's teeth bared in a wolfish\ngrin. \"His spies are, as you say, very good. But, this time, so are we.\nJust as hard and just as ruthless. Many of his spies among us have died;\nmost, if not all, of the rest are known. They, too, shall die. Glatius,\nfor instance. Once in a while, by the luck of the gods, a man kills a\nbetter man than he is; but Glatius has done it six times in a row,\nwithout getting a scratch. But the next time he fights, in spite of\nNero's protection, Glatius dies. Word has gone out, and there are\ngladiators' tricks that Nero never heard of.\"\n\n\"Quite true. One question, and I too may begin to hope. This is not the\nfirst time that gladiators have plotted against Ahenobarbus. Before the\nplotters could accomplish anything, however, they found themselves\nmatched against each other and the signal was always for death, never\nfor mercy. Has this...?\" Livius paused.\n\n\"It has not. It is that which gives me the hope I have. Nor are we\ngladiators alone in this. We have powerful friends at court; one of whom\nhas for days been carrying a knife sharpened especially to slip between\nNero's ribs. That he still carries that knife and that we still live are\nproofs enough for me that Ahenobarbus, the matricide and incendiary, has\nno suspicion whatever of what is going on.\"\n\n(At this point Nero on his throne burst into a roar of laughter, his\ngross body shaking with a merriment which Petronius and Tigellinus\nascribed to the death-throes of a Christian woman in the arena.)\n\n\"Is there any small thing which I should be told in order to be of\ngreatest use?\" Livius asked.\n\n\"Several. The prisons and the pits are so crowded with Christians that\nthey die and stink, and a pestilence threatens. To mend matters, some\nscores of hundreds of them are to be crucified here tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Why not? Everyone knows that they are poisoners of wells and murderers\nof children, and practitioners of magic. Wizards and witches.\"\n\n\"True enough.\" Patroclus shrugged his massive shoulders. \"But to get on,\ntomorrow night, at full dark, the remaining hundreds who have not been\ncrucified are to be--have you ever seen sarmentitii and semaxii?\"\n\n\"Once only. A gorgeous spectacle, truly, almost as thrilling as to feel\na man die on your sword. Men and women, wrapped in oil-soaked garments\nsmeared with pitch and chained to posts, make splendid torches indeed.\nYou mean, then, that...?\"\n\n\"Aye. In Caesar's own garden. When the light is brightest Nero will ride\nin parade. When his chariot passes the tenth torch our ally swings his\nknife. The Praetorians will rush around, but there will be a few moments\nof confusion during which we will go into action and the guards will\ndie. At the same time others of our party will take the palace and kill\nevery man, woman, and child adherent to Nero.\"\n\n\"Very nice--in theory.\" The Bithynian was frankly skeptical. \"But just\nhow are we going to get there? A few gladiators--such champions as\nPatroclus of Thrace--are at times allowed to do pretty much as they\nplease in their free time, and hence could possibly be on hand to take\npart in such a brawl, but most of us will be under lock and guard.\"\n\n\"That too, has been arranged. Our allies near the throne and certain\nother nobles and citizens of Rome, who have been winning large sums by\nour victories, have prevailed upon our masters to give a grand banquet\nto _all_ gladiators tomorrow night, immediately following the mass\ncrucifixion. It is going to be held in the Claudian Grove, just across\nfrom Caesar's Gardens.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Livius breathed deep; his eyes flashed. \"By Baal and Bacchus! By\nthe round, high breasts of Isis! For the first time in years I begin to\nlive! Our masters die first, then and there ... but hold--weapons?\"\n\n\"Will be provided. Bystanders will have them, and armor and shields,\nunder their cloaks. Our owners first, yes; and then the Praetorians. But\nnote, Livius, that Tigellinus, the Commander of the Guard, is mine--mine\nalone. I, personally, am going to cut his heart out.\"\n\n\"Granted. I heard that he had your wife for a time. But you seem quite\nconfident that you will still be alive tomorrow night. By Baal and\nIshtar, I wish I could feel so! With something to live for at last, I\ncan feel my guts turning to water--I can hear Charon's oars. Like as\nnot, now, some toe-dancing stripling of a retiarius will entangle me in\nhis net this very afternoon, and no mercy signal has been or will be\ngiven this day. Such is the crowd's temper, from Caesar down, that even\nyou will get 'Pollice verso' if you fall.\"\n\n\"True enough. But you had better get over that feeling, if you want to\nlive. As for me, I'm safe enough. I have made a vow to Jupiter, and he\nwho has protected me so long will not desert me now. Any man or any\nthing who faces me during these games, dies.\"\n\n\"I hope so, sin ... but listen! The horns ... and someone is coming!\"\n\nThe door behind them swung open. A lanista, or master of gladiators,\nladen with arms and armor, entered. The door swung to and was locked\nfrom the outside. The visitor was obviously excited, but stared\nwordlessly at Patroclus for seconds.\n\n\"Well, Iron-heart,\" he burst out finally, \"aren't you even curious about\nwhat you have got to do today?\"\n\n\"Not particularly,\" Patroclus replied, indifferently. \"Except to dress\nto fit. Why? Something special?\"\n\n\"_Extra_ special. The sensation of the year. Fermius himself. Unlimited.\nFree choice of weapons and armor.\"\n\n\"Fermius!\" Livius exclaimed. \"Fermius the Gaul? May Athene cover you\nwith her shield!\"\n\n\"You can say that for me, too,\" the lanista agreed, callously. \"Before I\nknew who was entered, like a fool, I bet a hundred sesterces on\nPatroclus here, at odds of only one to two, against the field. But\nlisten, Bronze-head. If you get the best of Fermius, I'll give you a\nfull third of my winnings.\"\n\n\"Thanks. You'll collect. A good man, Fermius, and smart. I've heard a\nlot about him, but never saw him work. He has seen me, which isn't so\ngood. Both heavy and fast--somewhat lighter than I am, and a bit faster.\nHe knows that I always fight Thracian, and that I'd be a fool to try\nanything else against him. He fights either Thracian or Samnite\ndepending upon the opposition. Against me his best bet would be to go\nSamnite. Do you know?\"\n\n\"No. They didn't say. He may not decide until the last moment.\"\n\n\"Unlimited, against me, he'll go Samnite. He'll have to. These\nunlimiteds are tough, but it gives me a chance to use a new trick I've\nbeen working on. I'll take that sword there--no scabbard--and two\ndaggers, besides my gladius. Get me a mace; the lightest real mace\nthey've got in their armory.\"\n\n\"A _mace_! Fighting _Thracian_, against a _Samnite_?\"\n\n\"Exactly. A mace. Am I going to fight Fermius, or do you want to do it\nyourself?\"\n\nThe mace was brought and Patroclus banged it, with a two-handed\nroundhouse swing, against a stone of the wall. The head remained solid\nupon the shaft. Good. They waited.\n\nTrumpets blared; the roar of the vast assemblage subsided almost to\nsilence.\n\n\"Grand Champion Fermius versus Grand Champion Patroclus,\" came the\nraucous announcement. \"Single combat. Any weapons that either chooses to\nuse, used in any way possible. No rest, no intermission. Enter!\"\n\nTwo armored figures strode toward the center of the arena. Patroclus'\narmor, from towering helmet down, and including the shield, was of\ndully-gleaming steel, completely bare of ornament. Each piece was marred\nand scarred; very plainly that armor was for use and had been used. On\nthe other hand, the Samnite half-armor of the Gaul was resplendent with\nthe decorations affected by his race. Fermius' helmet sported three\nbrilliantly-colored plumes, his shield and cuirass, enameled in half the\ncolors of the spectrum, looked as though they were being worn for the\nfirst time.\n\nFive yards apart, the gladiators stopped and wheeled to face the podium\nupon which Nero lolled. The buzz of conversation--the mace had excited\nno little comment and speculation--ceased. Patroclus heaved his\nponderous weapon into the air; the Gaul whirled up his long, sharp\nsword. They chanted in unison:\n\n    \"Ave, Caesar Imperator!\n    Morituri te salutant!\"\n\nThe starting-flag flashed downward; and at its first sight, long before\nit struck the ground, both men moved. Fermius whirled and leaped; but,\nfast as he was, he was not quite fast enough. That mace, which had\nseemed so heavy in the Thracian's hands a moment before, had become\nmiraculously maneuverable--it was hurtling through the air directly\ntoward the middle of his body! It did not strike its goal--Patroclus\nhoped that he was the only one there who suspected that he had not\nexpected it to touch his opponent--but in order to dodge the missile\nFermius had to break his stride; lost momentarily the fine co-ordination\nof his attack. And in that moment Patroclus struck. Struck, and struck\nagain.\n\nBut, as has been said, Fermius was both strong and fast. The first\nblow, aimed backhand at his bare right leg, struck his shield instead.\nThe left-handed stab, shield-encumbered as the left arm was, ditto. So\ndid the next trial, a vicious forehand cut. The third of the mad flurry\nof swordcuts, only partially deflected by the sword which Fermius could\nonly then get into play, sheared down and a red, a green, and a white\nplume floated toward the ground. The two fighters sprang apart and\nstudied each other briefly.\n\nFrom the gladiators' standpoint, this had been the veriest preliminary\nskirmishing. That the Gaul had lost his plumes and that his armor showed\ngreat streaks of missing enamel meant no more to either than that the\nThracian's supposedly surprise attack had failed. Each knew that he\nfaced the deadliest fighter of his world; but if that knowledge affected\neither man, the other could not perceive it.\n\nBut the crowd went wild. Nothing like that first terrific\npassage-at-arms had ever before been seen. Death, sudden and violent,\nhad been in the air. The arena was saturated with it. Hearts had been\necstatically in throats. Each person there, man or woman, had felt the\nindescribable thrill of death--vicariously, safely--and every fiber of\ntheir lusts demanded more. More! Each spectator knew that one of those\nmen would die that afternoon. None wanted, or would permit them both to\nlive. This was to the death, and death there would be.\n\nWomen, their faces blotched and purple with emotion, shrieked and\nscreamed. Men, stamping their feet and waving their arms, yelled and\nswore. And many, men and women alike, laid wagers.\n\n\"Five hundred sesterces on Fermius!\" one shouted, tablet and stylus in\nair.\n\n\"Taken!\" came an answering yell. \"The Gaul is done--Patroclus all but\nhad him there!\"\n\n\"One thousand, you!\" came another challenge. \"Patroclus missed his\nchance and will never get another--a thousand on Fermius!\"\n\n\"Two thousand!\"\n\n\"Five thousand!\"\n\n\"Ten!\"\n\nThe fighters closed--swung--stabbed. Shields clanged vibrantly under the\nimpact of fended strokes, swords whined and snarled. Back and\nforth--circling--giving and taking ground--for minute after endless\nminute that desperately furious exhibition of skill, of speed and of\npower and of endurance went on. And as it went on, longer and longer\npast the time expected by even the most optimistic, tension mounted\nhigher and higher.\n\nBlood flowed crimson down the Gaul's bare leg and the crowd screamed its\napproval. Blood trickled out of the joints of the Thracian's armor and\nit became a frenzied mob.\n\nNo human body could stand that pace for long. Both men were tiring fast,\nand slowing. With the drive of his weight and armor, Patroclus forced\nthe Gaul to go where he wanted him to go. Then, apparently gathering his\nevery resource for a final effort, the Thracian took one short, choppy\nstep forward and swung straight down, with all his strength.\n\nThe blood-smeared hilt turned in his hands; the blade struck flat and\nbroke, its length whining viciously away. Fermius, although staggered by\nthe sheer brute force of the abortive stroke, recovered almost\ninstantly; dropping his sword and snatching at his gladius to take\nadvantage of the wonderful opportunity thus given him.\n\nBut that breaking had not been accidental; Patroclus made no attempt to\nrecover his balance. Instead, he ducked past the surprised and shaken\nGaul. Still stooping, he seized the mace, which everyone except he had\nforgotten, and swung; swung with all the totalized and synchronized\npower of hands, wrists, arms, shoulders, and magnificent body.\n\nThe iron head of the ponderous weapon struck the center of the Gaul's\ncuirass, which crunched inward like so much cardboard. Fermius seemed to\nleave the ground and, folded around the mace, to fly briefly through the\nair. As he struck the ground, Patroclus was upon him. The Gaul was\nprobably already dead--that blow would have killed an elephant--but that\nmade no difference. If that mob knew that Fermius was dead, they might\nstart yelling for his life, too. Hence, by lifting his head and poising\nhis dirk high in air, he asked of Caesar his Imperial will.\n\nThe crowd, already frantic, had gone stark mad at the blow. No thought\nof mercy could or did exist in that insanely bloodthirsty throng; no\nthought of clemency for the man who had fought such a magnificent fight.\nIn cooler moments they would have wanted him to live, to thrill them\nagain and yet again; but now, for almost half an hour, they had been\nloving the hot, the suffocating thrill of death in their throats. Now\nthey wanted, and would have, the ultimate thrill.\n\n\"Death!\" The solid structure rocked to the crescendo roar of the demand.\n\"_Death_! DEATH!\"\n\nNero's right thumb pressed horizontally against his chest. Every vestal\nwas making the same sign. Pollice verso. Death. The strained and\nstrident yelling of the mob grew even louder.\n\nPatroclus lowered his dagger and delivered the unnecessary and unfelt\nthrust; and--\n\n\"Peractum est!\" arose one deafening yell.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThus the red-haired Thracian lived; and also, somewhat to his own\nsurprise, did Livius.\n\n\"I'm glad to see you, Bronze-heart, by the white thighs of Ceres, I am!\"\nthat worthy exclaimed, when the two met, the following day. Patroclus\nhad never seen the Bithynian so buoyant. \"Pallas Athene covered you,\nlike I asked her to. But by the red beak of Thoth and the sacred Zaimph\nof Tanit, it gave me the horrors when you made that throw so quick and\nmissed it, and I went as crazy as the rest of them when you pulled the\nreal coup. But now, curse it, I suppose that we'll all have to be on the\nlookout for it--or no, unlimiteds aren't common, thank Ninib the Smiter\nand his scarlet spears!\"\n\n\"I hear you didn't do so badly, yourself,\" Patroclus interrupted his\nfriend's loquacity. \"I missed your first two, but I saw you take\nKalendios. He's a high-rater--one of the best of the locals--and I was\nafraid he might snare you, but from the looks of you, you got only a\ncouple of stabs. Nice work.\"\n\n\"Prayer, my boy. Prayer is the stuff. I prayed to 'em in order, and hit\nthe jackpot with Shamash. My guts curled up again, like they belong, and\nI knew that the portents were all in my favor. Besides, when you were\nwalking out to meet Fermius, did you notice that red-headed Greek\nposturer making passes at you?\"\n\n\"Huh? Don't be a fool. I had other things to think of.\"\n\n\"So I figured. So did she, probably, because after a while she came\naround behind with a lanista and made eyes at me. I must have the next\nbest shape to you here, I guess. What a wench! Anyway, I felt better and\nbetter, and before she left I knew that no damn retiarius that ever\nwaved a trident could put a net past my guard. And they couldn't either.\nA couple more like that and I'll be a Grand Champion myself. But they're\ndigging holes for the crosses and there's the horn that the feast is\nready. This show is going to be really good.\"\n\nThey ate, hugely and with unmarred appetite, of the heaped food which\nNero had provided. They returned to their assigned places to see\ncrosses, standing as close together as they could be placed and each\nbearing a suffering Christian, filling the whole vast expanse of the\narena.\n\nAnd, if the truth must be told, those two men enjoyed thoroughly every\nmoment of that long and sickeningly horrible afternoon. They were the\nhardest products of the hardest school the world has ever known: trained\nrigorously to deal out death mercilessly at command; to accept death\nunflinchingly at need. They should not and can not be judged by the\nhigher, finer standards of a softer, gentler day.\n\nThe afternoon passed; evening approached. All the gladiators then in\nRome assembled in the Claudian Grove, around tables creaking under their\nloads of food and wine. Women, too, were there in profusion; women for\nthe taking and yearning to be taken; and the tide of revelry ran open,\nwide, and high. Although all ate and apparently drank with abandon, most\nof the wine was in fact wasted. And as the sky darkened, most of the\ngladiators, one by one, began to get rid of their female companions upon\none pretext or another and to drift toward the road which separated the\nfestivities from the cloaked and curious throng of lookers-on.\n\nAt full dark, a red glare flared into the sky from Caesar's garden and\nthe gladiators, deployed now along the highway, dashed across it and\nseemed to wrestle briefly with cloaked figures. Then armed,\nmore-or-less-armored men ran back to the scene of their reveling.\nSwords, daggers, and gladii thrust, stabbed, and cut. Tables and benches\nran red; ground and grass grew slippery with blood.\n\nThe conspirators turned then and rushed toward the Emperor's brilliantly\ntorch-lit garden. Patroclus, however, was not in the van. He had had\ntrouble in finding a cuirass big enough for him to get into. He had been\ndelayed further by the fact that he had had to kill three strange\nlanistae before he could get at his owner, the man he really wanted to\nslay. He was therefore some little distance behind the other gladiators\nwhen Petronius rushed up to him and seized him by the arm.\n\nWhite and trembling, the noble was not now the exquisite Arbiter\nElegantiae; nor the imperturbable Augustian.\n\n\"Patroclus! In the name of Bacchus, Patroclus, why do the men go there\nnow? No signal was given--I could not get to Nero!\"\n\n\"What?\" the Thracian blazed. \"Vulcan and his fiends! It _was_ given--I\nheard it myself! What went wrong?\"\n\n\"Everything.\" Petronius licked his lips. \"I was standing right beside\nhim. No one else was near enough to interfere. It was--should have\nbeen--easy. But after I got my knife out I couldn't move. It was his\n_eyes_, Patroclus--I swear it, by the white breasts of Venus! He has the\nevil eye--I couldn't move a muscle, I tell you! Then, although I didn't\nwant to, I turned and ran!\"\n\n\"How did you find _me_ so quick?\"\n\n\"I--I--I--don't know,\" the frantic Arbiter stuttered. \"I ran and ran,\nand there you were. But what are we--you--going to do?\"\n\nPatroclus' mind raced. He believed implicitly that Jupiter guarded him\npersonally. He believed in the other gods and goddesses of Rome. He more\nthan half believed in the multitudinous deities of Greece, of Egypt, and\neven of Babylon. The other world was real and close; the evil eye only\none of the many inexplicable facts of every-day life. Nevertheless, in\nspite of his credulity--or perhaps in part because of it--he also\nbelieved firmly in himself; in his own powers. Wherefore he soon came to\na decision.\n\n\"Jupiter, ward from me Ahenobarbus' evil eye!\" he called aloud, and\nturned.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" Petronius, still shaking, demanded.\n\n\"To do the job _you_ swore to do, of course--to kill that bloated toad.\nAnd then to give Tigellinus what I have owed him so long.\"\n\nAt full run, he soon overtook his fellows, and waded resistlessly into\nthe fray. He was Grand Champion Patroclus, working at his trade; the\nhard-learned trade which he knew so well. No Praetorian or ordinary\nsoldier could stand before him save momentarily. He did not have all of\nhis Thracian armor, but he had enough. Man after man faced him, and man\nafter man died.\n\nAnd Nero, sitting at ease with a beautiful boy at his right and a\nbeautiful harlot at his left, gazed appreciatively through his emerald\nlens at the flaming torches; the while, with a very small fraction of\nhis Eddorian mind, he mused upon the matter of Patroclus and Tigellinus.\n\nShould he let the Thracian kill the Commander of his Guard? Or not? It\ndidn't really matter, one way or the other. In fact, nothing about this\nwhole foul planet--this ultra-microscopic, if offensive, speck of cosmic\ndust in the Eddorian Scheme of Things--really mattered at all. It would\nbe mildly amusing to watch the gladiator consummate his vengeance by\ncarving the Roman to bits. But, on the other hand, there was such a\nthing as pride of workmanship. Viewed in that light, the Thracian could\nnot kill Tigellinus, because that bit of corruption had a few more jobs\nto do. He must descend lower and lower into unspeakable depravity,\nfinally to cut his own throat with a razor. Although Patroclus would not\nknow it--it was better technique not to let him know it--the Thracian's\nproposed vengeance would have been futility itself compared with that\nwhich the luckless Roman was to wreak on himself.\n\nWherefore a shrewdly-placed blow knocked the helmet from Patroclus' head\nand a mace crashed down, spattering his brains abroad.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThus ended the last significant attempt to save the civilization of\nRome; in a fiasco so complete that even such meticulous historians as\nTacitus and Suetonius mention it merely as a minor disturbance of Nero's\ngarden party.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_The planet Tellus circled its sun some twenty hundred times. Sixty-odd\ngenerations of men were born and died, but that was not enough. The\nArisian program of genetics required more. Therefore the Elders, after\ndue deliberation, agreed that that Civilization, too, must be allowed to\nfall. And Gharlane of Eddore, recalled to duty from the middle of a\nmuch-too-short vacation, found things in very bad shape indeed and went\nbusily to work setting them to rights. He had slain one fellow-member of\nthe Innermost Circle, but there might very well have been more than one\nMaster involved._\n\n\n\n\nBOOK TWO\n\nTHE WORLD WAR\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\n1918\n\n\nSobbing furiously, Captain Ralph Kinnison wrenched at his stick--with\nhalf of his control surfaces shot away the crate was hellishly logy. He\ncould step out, of course, the while saluting the victorious Jerries,\nbut he wasn't on fire--yet--and hadn't been hit--yet. He ducked and\nflinched sidewise as another burst of bullets stitched another seam\nalong his riddled fuselage and whanged against his dead engine. Afire?\nNot yet--good! Maybe he could land the heap, after all!\n\nSlowly--oh, _so_ sluggishly--the Spad began to level off, toward the\nedge of the wheatfield and that friendly, inviting ditch. If the krauts\ndidn't get him with their next pass....\n\nHe heard a chattering beneath him--Brownings, by God!--and the expected\nburst did not come. He knew that he had been just about over the front\nwhen they conked his engine; it was a toss-up whether he would come down\nin enemy territory or not. But now, for the first time in ages, it\nseemed, there were machine-guns going that were not aimed at him!\n\nHis landing-gear swished against stubble and he fought with all his\nstrength of body and of will to keep the Spad's tail down. He almost\nsucceeded; his speed was almost spent when he began to nose over. He\nleaped, then, and as he struck ground he curled up and rolled--he had\nbeen a motorcycle racer for years--feeling as he did so a wash of heat:\na tracer had found his gas-tank at last! Bullets were thudding into the\nground; one shrieked past his head as, stooping over, folded into the\nsmallest possible target, he galloped awkwardly toward the ditch.\n\nThe Brownings still yammered, filling the sky with cupro-nickeled lead;\nand while Kinnison was flinging himself full length into the protecting\nwater and mud, he heard a tremendous crash. One of those Huns had been\ntoo intent on murder; had stayed a few seconds too long; had come a few\nmeters too close.\n\nThe clamor of the guns stopped abruptly.\n\n\"We got one! We got one!\" a yell of exultation.\n\n\"Stay down! Keep low, you boneheads!\" roared a voice of authority, quite\nevidently a sergeant's. \"Wanna get your blocks shot off? Take down them\nguns; we gotta get to hell out of here. Hey, you flyer! Are you O.K., or\nwounded, or maybe dead?\"\n\nKinnison spat out mud until he could talk. \"O.K.!\" he shouted, and\nstarted to lift an eye above the low bank. He stopped, however, as\nwhistling metal, sheeting in from the north, told him that such action\nwould be decidedly unsafe. \"But I ain't leaving this ditch right\nnow--sounds mighty hot out there!\"\n\n\"You said it, brother. It's hotter than the hinges of hell, from behind\nthat ridge over there. But ooze down that ditch a piece, around the\nfirst bend. It's pretty well in the clear there, and besides, you'll\nfind a ledge of rocks running straight across the flat. Cross over there\nand climb the hill--join us by that dead snag up there. We got to get\nout of here. That sausage over there must have seen this shindig and\nthey'll blow this whole damn area off the map. Snap it up! And you, you\ngoldbricks, get the lead out of your pants!\"\n\nKinnison followed directions. He found the ledge and emerged, scraping\nthick and sticky mud from his uniform. He crawled across the little\nplain. An occasional bullet whined through the air, far above him; but,\nas the sergeant had said, this bit of terrain was \"in the clear.\" He\nclimbed the hill, approached the gaunt, bare tree-trunk. He heard men\nmoving, and cautiously announced himself.\n\n\"OK., fella,\" came the sergeant's deep bass. \"Yeah, it's us. Shake a\nleg!\"\n\n\"That's easy!\" Kinnison laughed for the first time that day. \"I'm\nshaking already, like a hula-hula dancer's empennage. What outfit is\nthis, and where are we?\"\n\n\"BRROOM!\" The earth trembled, the air vibrated. Below and to the north,\nalmost exactly where the machine-guns had been, an awe-inspiring cloud\nbillowed majestically into the air; a cloud composed of smoke, vapor,\npulverized earth, chunks of rock, and debris of what had been trees. Nor\nwas it alone.\n\n\"Crack! Bang! Tweet! Boom! Wham!\" Shells of all calibers, high explosive\nand gas, came down in droves. The landscape disappeared. The little\ncompany of Americans, in complete silence and with one mind, devoted\nthemselves to accumulating distance. Finally, when they had to stop for\nbreath:\n\n\"Section B, attached to the 76th Field Artillery,\" the sergeant answered\nthe question as though it had just been asked. \"As to where we are,\nsomewhere between Berlin and Paris is about all I can tell you. We got\nhell knocked out of us yesterday, and have been running around lost ever\nsince. They shot off a rally signal on top of this here hill, though,\nand we was just going to shove off when we seen the krauts chasing you.\"\n\n\"Thanks. I'd better rally with you, I guess--find out where we are, and\nwhat's the chance of getting back to my own outfit.\"\n\n\"Damn slim, I'd say. Boches are all around us here, thicker than fleas\non a dog.\"\n\nThey approached the summit, were challenged, were accepted. They saw a\ngray-haired man--an old man, for such a location--seated calmly upon a\nrock, smoking a cigarette. His smartly-tailored uniform, which fitted\nperfectly his not-so-slender figure, was muddy and tattered. One leg of\nhis breeches was torn half away, revealing a blood-soaked bandage.\nAlthough he was very evidently an officer, no insignia were visible. As\nKinnison and the gunners approached, a first lieutenant--practically\nspic-and-span--spoke to the man on the rock.\n\n\"First thing to do is to settle the matter of rank,\" he announced,\ncrisply. \"I'm First Lieutenant Randolph, of....\"\n\n\"Rank, eh?\" The seated one grinned and spat out the butt of his\ncigarette. \"But then, it was important to me, too, when I was a first\nlieutenant--about the time that you were born. Slayton, Major-General.\"\n\n\"Oh ... excuse me, sir....\"\n\n\"Skip it. How many men you got, and what are they?\"\n\n\"Seven, sir. We brought in a wire from Inf....\"\n\n\"A _wire_! Hellanddamnation, why haven't you got it with you, then? Get\nit!\"\n\nThe crestfallen officer disappeared; the general turned to Kinnison and\nthe sergeant.\n\n\"Have you got any ammunition, sergeant?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. About thirty belts.\"\n\n\"Thank God! We can use it, and you. As for you, Captain, I don't\nknow....\"\n\nThe wire came up. The general seized the instrument and cranked.\n\n\"Get me Spearmint ... Spearmint? Slayton--give me Weatherby.... This is\nSlayton ... yes, but ... No, but I want ... Hellanddamnation, Weatherby,\nshut up and let me talk--don't you know that this wire's apt to be cut\nany second? We're on top of Hill Fo-wer, Ni-yun, Sev-en--that's\nright--about two hundred men; maybe three. Composite--somebody,\napparently, from half the outfits in France. Too fast and too far--both\nflanks wide open--cut off ... Hello! Hello! Hello!\" He dropped the\ninstrument and turned to Kinnison. \"You want to go back, Captain, and I\nneed a runner--bad. Want to try to get through?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"First phone you come to, get Spearmint--General Weatherby. Tell him\nSlayton says that we're cut off, but the Germans aren't in much force\nnor in good position, and for God's sake to get some air and tanks in\nhere to keep them from consolidating. Just a minute. Sergeant, what's\nyour name?\" He studied the burly non-com minutely.\n\n\"Wells, sir.\"\n\n\"What would you say ought to be done with the machine-guns?\"\n\n\"Cover that ravine, there, first. Then set up to enfilade if they try to\ncome up over there. Then, if I could find any more guns, I'd....\"\n\n\"Enough. Second Lieutenant Wells, from now. GHQ will confirm. Take\ncharge of all the guns we have. Report when you have made disposition.\nNow, Kinnison, listen. I can probably hold out until tonight. The enemy\ndoesn't know yet that we're here, but we are due for some action pretty\nquick now, and when they locate us--if there aren't too many of their\nown units here, too--they'll flatten this hill like a table. So tell\nWeatherby to throw a column in here as soon as it gets dark, and to\nadvance Eight and Sixty, so as to consolidate this whole area. Got it?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Got a compass?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Pick up a tin hat and get going. A hair north of due west, about a\nkilometer and a half. Keep cover, because the going will be tough. Then\nyou'll come to a road. It's a mess, but it's ours--or was, at last\naccounts--so the worst of it will be over. On that road, which goes\nsouth-west, about two kilometers further, you'll find a Post--you'll\nknow it by the motorcycles and such. Phone from there. Luck!\"\n\nBullets began to whine and the general dropped to the ground and crawled\ntoward a coppice, bellowing orders as he went. Kinnison crawled, too,\nstraight west, availing himself of all possible cover, until he\nencountered a sergeant-major reclining against the south side of a great\ntree.\n\n\"Cigarette, buddy?\" that wight demanded.\n\n\"Sure. Take the pack. I've got another that'll last me--maybe more. But\nwhat the hell goes on here? Who ever heard of a major general getting\nfar enough up front to get shot in the leg, and he talks as though he\nwere figuring on licking the whole German army. Is the old bird nuts, or\nwhat?\"\n\n\"Not so you would notice it. Didn'cha ever hear of 'Hellandamnation'\nSlayton? You will, buddy, you will. If Pershing doesn't give him three\nstars after this, he's crazier than hell. He ain't supposed to be on\ncombat at all--he's from GHQ and can make or break anybody in the AEF.\nOut here on a look-see trip and couldn't get back. But you got to hand\nit to him--he's getting things organized in great shape. I came in with\nhim--I'm about all that's left of them that did--just waiting for this\nbreeze to die down, but its getting worse. We'd better duck--over\nthere!\"\n\nBullets whistled and stormed, breaking more twigs and branches from the\nalready shattered, practically denuded trees. The two slid precipitately\ninto the indicated shell-hole, into stinking mud. Wells' guns burst into\naction.\n\n\"Damn! I hated to do this,\" the sergeant grumbled, \"On accounta I just\ngot half dry.\"\n\n\"Wise me up,\" Kinnison directed. \"The more I know about things, the more\napt I am to get through.\"\n\n\"This is what is left of two battalions, and a lot of casuals. They made\nobjective, but it turns out the outfits on their right and left\ncouldn't, leaving their flanks right out in the open air. Orders come in\nby blinker to rectify the line by falling back, but by then it couldn't\nbe done. Under observation.\"\n\nKinnison nodded. He knew what a barrage would have done to a force\ntrying to cross such open ground in daylight.\n\n\"One man could prob'ly make it, though, if he was careful and kept his\neyes wide open,\" the sergeant-major continued. \"But you ain't got no\nbinoculars, have you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Get a pair easy enough. You saw them boots without any hobnails in 'em,\nsticking out from under some blankets?\"\n\n\"Yes. I get you.\" Kinnison knew that combat officers did not wear\nhobnails, and usually carried binoculars. \"How come so many at once?\"\n\n\"Just about all the officers that got this far. Conniving, my guess is,\nbehind old Slayton's back. Anyway, a kraut aviator spots 'em and dives.\nOur machine-guns got him, but not until after he heaved a bomb. Dead\ncenter. Christ, what a mess! But there's six-seven good glasses in\nthere. I'd grab one myself, but the general would see it--he can see\nright through the lid of a mess-kit. Well, the boys have shut those\nkrauts up, so I'll hunt the old man up and tell him what I found out.\n_Damn_ this mud!\"\n\nKinnison emerged sinuously and snaked his way to a row of blanket\ncovered forms. He lifted a blanket and gasped: then vomited up\neverything, it seemed, that he had eaten for days. But he _had_ to have\nthe binoculars.\n\nHe got them.\n\nThen, still retching, white and shaken, he crept westward; availing\nhimself of every possible item of cover.\n\nFor some time, from a point somewhere north of his route, a machine-gun\nhad been intermittently at work. It was close; but the very loudness of\nits noise, confused as it was by resounding echoes, made it impossible\nto locate at all exactly the weapon's position. Kinnison crept forward\ninchwise; scanning every foot of visible terrain through his powerful\nglass. He knew by the sound that it was German. More, since what he did\nnot know about machine-guns could have been printed in bill-poster type\nupon the back of his hand, he knew that it was a Maxim, Model 1907--a\nmean, mean gun. He deduced that it was doing plenty of damage to his\nfellows back on the hill, and that they had not been able to do much of\nanything about it. And it was beautifully hidden; even he, close as he\nmust be, couldn't see it. But damn it, there _had_ to be a....\n\nMinute after minute, unmoving save for the traverse of his binoculars,\nhe searched, and finally he found. A tiny plume--the veriest wisp--of\nvapor, rising from the surface of the brook. Steam! Steam from the\ncooling jacket of that Maxim 1907! And there was the tube!\n\nCautiously he moved around until he could trace that tube to its\nbusiness end--the carefully-hidden emplacement. There it was! He\ncouldn't maintain his westward course without them spotting him; nor\ncould he go around far enough. And besides ... and besides that, there\nwould be at least a patrol, if it hadn't gone up the hill already. And\nthere were grenades available, right close....\n\nHe crept up to one of the gruesome objects he had been avoiding, and\nwhen he crept away he half-carried, half-dragged three grenades in a\ncanvas bag. He wormed his way to a certain boulder. He straightened up,\npulled three pins, swung his arm three times.\n\nBang! Bam! Pow! The camouflage disappeared; so did the shrubbery for\nyards around. Kinnison had ducked behind the rock, but he ducked still\ndeeper as a chunk of something, its force pretty well spent, clanged\nagainst his steel helmet. Another object thudded beside him--a leg,\ngray-clad and wearing a heavy field boot!\n\nKinnison wanted to be sick again, but he had neither the time nor the\ncontents.\n\nAnd damn! What _lousy_ throwing! He had never been any good at baseball,\nbut he supposed that he could hit a thing as big as that gun-pit--but\nnot one of his grenades had gone in. The crew would probably be\ndead--from concussion, if nothing else--but the gun probably wasn't even\nhurt. He would have to go over there and cripple it himself.\n\nHe went--not exactly boldly--forty-five in hand. The Germans looked\ndead. One of them sprawled on the parapet, right in his way. He gave the\nbody a shove, watched it roll down the slope. As it rolled, however, it\ncame to life and yelled; and at that yell there occurred a thing at\nwhich young Kinnison's hair stood straight up inside his iron helmet. On\nthe gray of the blasted hillside hitherto unseen gray forms moved; moved\ntoward their howling comrade. And Kinnison, blessing for the first time\nin his life his inept throwing arm, hoped fervently that the Maxim was\nstill in good working order.\n\nA few seconds of inspection showed him that it was. The gun had\npractically a full belt and there was plenty more. He placed a box--he\nwould have no Number Two to help him here--took hold of the grips,\nshoved off the safety, and squeezed the trip. The gun roared--what a\ngorgeous, what a heavenly racket that Maxim made! He traversed until he\ncould see where the bullets were striking: then swung the stream of\nmetal to and fro. One belt and the Germans were completely disorganized;\ntwo belts and he could see no signs of life.\n\nHe pulled the Maxim's block and threw it away; shot the water-jacket\nfull of holes. That gun was done. Nor had he increased his own hazard.\nUnless more Germans came very soon, nobody would ever know who had done\nwhat, or to whom.\n\nHe slithered away; resumed earnestly his westward course: going as fast\nas--sometimes a trifle faster than--caution would permit. But there were\nno more alarms. He crossed the dangerously open ground; sulked rapidly\nthrough the frightfully shattered wood. He reached the road, strode\nalong it around the first bend, and stopped, appalled. He had heard of\nsuch things, but he had never seen one; and mere description has always\nbeen and always will be completely inadequate. Now he was walking right\ninto it--the thing he was to see in nightmare for all the rest of his\nninety-six years of life.\n\nActually, there was very little to see. The road ended abruptly. What\nhad been a road, what had been wheatfields and farms, what had been\nwoods, were practically indistinguishable, one from the other; were\nfantastically and impossibly the same. The entire area had been churned.\nWorse--it was as though the ground and its every surface object had been\nrun through a gargantuan mill and spewed abroad. Splinters of wood,\nriven chunks of metal, a few scraps of bloody flesh. Kinnison screamed,\nthen, and ran; ran back and around that blasted acreage. And as he ran,\nhis mind built up pictures; pictures which became only the more vivid\nbecause of his frantic efforts to wipe them out.\n\nThat road, the night before, had been one of the world's most heavily\ntraveled highways. Motorcycles, trucks, bicycles. Ambulances. Kitchens.\nStaff-cars and other automobiles. Guns; from seventy-fives up to the big\nboys, whose tremendous weight drove their wide caterpillar treads inches\ndeep into solid ground. Horses. Mules. And people--_especially_\npeople--like himself. Solid columns of men, marching as fast as they\ncould step--there weren't trucks enough to haul them all. That road had\nbeen crowded--jammed. Like State and Madison at noon, only more so.\nOver-jammed with all the personnel, all the instrumentation and\nincidentalia, all the weaponry, of war.\n\nAnd upon that teeming, seething highway there had descended a rain of\nsteel-encased high explosive. Possibly some gas, but probably not. The\nGerman High Command had given orders to pulverize that particular area\nat that particular time; and hundreds, or perhaps thousands, of German\nguns, in a micrometrically-synchronized symphony of firepower, had\npulverized it. Just that. Literally. Precisely. No road remained; no\nfarm, no field, no building, no tree or shrub. The bits of flesh might\nhave come from horse or man or mule; few indeed were the scraps of metal\nwhich retained enough of their original shape to show what they had once\nbeen.\n\nKinnison ran--or staggered--around that obscene blot and struggled back\nto the road. It was shell-pocked, but passable. He hoped that the\nshell-holes would decrease in number as he went along, but they did not.\nThe enemy had put this whole road out of service. And that farm, the\nP.C., ought to be around the next bend.\n\nIt was, but it was no longer a Post of Command. Either by directed\nfire--star-shell illumination--or by uncannily accurate chart-work, they\nhad put some heavy shell exactly where they would do the most damage.\nThe buildings were gone; the cellar in which the P.C. had been was now a\ngaping crater. Parts of motorcycles and of staff cars littered the\nground. Stark tree trunks--all bare of leaves, some riven of all except\nthe largest branches, a few stripped even of bark--stood gauntly. In a\ncrotch of one, Kinnison saw with rising horror, hung the limp and\nshattered naked torso of a man; blown completely out of his clothes.\n\nShells were--had been, right along--coming over occasionally. Big ones,\nbut high; headed for targets well to the west. Nothing close enough to\nworry about. Two ambulances, a couple of hundred meters apart, were\ncoming; working their way along the road, between the holes. The first\none slowed ... stopped.\n\n\"Seen anybody--Look out! Duck!\"\n\nKinnison had already heard that unmistakable, unforgettable screech, was\nalready diving headlong into the nearest hole. There was a crash as\nthough the world were falling apart. Something smote him; seemed to\ndrive him bodily into the ground. His light went out. When he recovered\nconsciousness he was lying upon a stretcher; two men were bending over\nhim.\n\n\"What hit me?\" he gasped. \"Am I...?\" He stopped. He was afraid to ask:\nafraid even to try to move, lest he should find that he didn't have any\narms or legs.\n\n\"A wheel, and maybe some of the axle, of the other ambulance, is all,\"\none of the men assured him. \"Nothing much; you're practically as good as\never. Shoulder and arm bunged up a little and something--maybe shrapnel,\nthough--poked you in the guts. But we've got you all fixed up, so take\nit easy and....\"\n\n\"What we want to know is,\" his partner interrupted, \"Is there anybody\nelse alive up here?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" Kinnison shook his head.\n\n\"O.K. Just wanted to be sure. Lots of business back there, and it won't\ndo any harm to have a doctor look at you.\"\n\n\"Get me to a 'phone, as fast as you can,\" Kinnison directed, in a voice\nwhich he thought was strong and full of authority, but which in fact\nwas neither. \"I've got an important message for General Weatherby, at\nSpearmint.\"\n\n\"Better tell us what it is, hadn't you?\" The ambulance was now jolting\nalong what had been the road. \"They've got phones at the hospital where\nwe're going, but you might faint or something before we get there.\"\n\nKinnison told, but fought to retain what consciousness he had.\nThroughout that long, rough ride he fought. He won. He himself spoke to\nGeneral Weatherby--the doctors, knowing him to be a Captain of Aviation\nand realizing that his message should go direct, helped him telephone.\nHe himself received the General's sizzlingly sulphurous assurance that\nrelief would be sent and that that quadruply-qualified line would be\nrectified that night.\n\nThen someone jabbed him with a needle and he lapsed into a dizzy, fuzzy\ncoma, from which he did not emerge completely for weeks. He had lucid\nintervals at times, but he did not, at the time or ever, know surely\nwhat was real and what was fantasy.\n\nThere were doctors, doctors, doctors; operations, operations,\noperations. There were hospital tents, into which quiet men were\ncarried; from which still quieter men were removed. There was a larger\nhospital, built of wood. There was a machine that buzzed and white-clad\nmen who studied films and papers. There were scraps of conversation.\n\n\"Belly wounds are bad,\" Kinnison thought--he was never sure--that he\nheard one of them say. \"And such contusions and multiple and compound\nfractures as those don't help a bit. Prognosis unfavorable--distinctly\nso--but we'll soon see what we can do. Interesting case ... fascinating.\nWhat would you do, Doctor, if you were doing it?\"\n\n\"I'd let it alone!\" A younger, stronger voice declared, fervently.\n\"Multiple perforations, infection, extravasation, oedema--uh-uh! I am\nwatching, Doctor, and learning!\"\n\nAnother interlude, and another. Another. And others. Until finally,\norders were given which Kinnison did not hear at all.\n\n\"Adrenalin! Massage! Massage hell out of him!\"\n\nKinnison again came to--partially to, rather--anguished in every fiber\nof his being. Somebody was sticking barbed arrows into every square inch\nof his skin; somebody else was pounding and mauling him all over, taking\nparticular pains to pummel and to wrench at all the places where he hurt\nthe worst. He yelled at the top of his voice; yelled and swore bitterly:\n\"QUIT IT!\" being the expurgated gist of his luridly profane protests.\nHe did not make nearly as much noise as he supposed, but he made enough.\n\n\"Thank God!\" Kinnison heard a lighter, softer voice. Surprised, he\nstopped swearing and tried to stare. He couldn't see very well, either,\nbut he was pretty sure that there was a middle-aged woman there. There\nwas, and her eyes were not dry. \"He is going to live, after all!\"\n\nAs the days passed, he began really to sleep, naturally and deeply.\n\nHe grew hungrier and hungrier, and they would not give him enough to\neat. He was by turns sullen, angry, and morose.\n\nIn short, he was convalescent.\n\nFor Captain Ralph K. Kinnison, THE WAR was over.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\n1941\n\n\nChubby, brownette Eunice Kinnison sat in a rocker, reading the Sunday\npapers and listening to her radio. Her husband Ralph lay sprawled upon\nthe davenport, smoking a cigarette and reading the current issue of\nEXTRAORDINARY STORIES against an unheard background of music. Mentally,\nhe was far from Tellus, flitting in his super-dreadnaught through parsec\nafter parsec of vacuous space.\n\nThe music broke off without warning and there blared out an announcement\nwhich yanked Ralph Kinnison back to Earth with a violence almost\nphysical. He jumped up, jammed his hands into his pockets.\n\n\"Pearl Harbor!\" he blurted. \"How in.... How could they have let them get\n_that_ far?\"\n\n\"But _Frank_!\" the woman gasped. She had not worried much about her\nhusband; but Frank, her son.... \"He'll have to go....\" Her voice died\naway.\n\n\"Not a chance in the world.\" Kinnison did not speak to soothe, but as\nthough from sure knowledge. \"Designing Engineer for Lockwood? He'll want\nto, all right, but anyone who was ever even exposed to a course in\naeronautical engineering will sit this war out.\"\n\n\"But they say it can't last very long. It can't, can it?\"\n\n\"I'll say it can. Loose talk. Five years minimum is my guess--not that\nmy guess is any better than anybody else's.\"\n\nHe prowled around the room. His somber expression did not lighten.\n\n\"I knew it,\" the woman said at length. \"You, too--even after the last\none.... You haven't said anything, so I thought, perhaps....\"\n\n\"I know I didn't. There was always the chance that we wouldn't get drawn\ninto it. If you say so, though, I'll stay home.\"\n\n\"Am I apt to? I let you go when you were really in danger....\"\n\n\"What do you mean by _that_ crack?\" he interrupted.\n\n\"Regulations. One year too old--Thank Heaven!\"\n\n\"So what? They'll need technical experts, bad. They'll make exceptions.\"\n\n\"Possibly. Desk jobs. Desk officers don't get killed in action--or even\nwounded. Why, perhaps, with the children all grown up and married, we\nwon't even have to be separated.\"\n\n\"Another angle--financial.\"\n\n\"Pooh! Who cares about that? Besides, for a man out of a job....\"\n\n\"From you, I'll let that one pass. Thanks, Eunie--you're an ace. I'll\nshoot 'em a wire.\"\n\nThe telegram was sent. The Kinnisons waited. And waited. Until, about\nthe middle of January, beautifully-phrased and beautifully-mimeographed\nletters began to arrive.\n\n\"The War Department recognizes the value of your previous military\nexperience and appreciates your willingness once again to take up arms\nin defense of the country ... Veteran Officer's Questionnaire ... please\nfill out completely ... Form 191A ... Form 170 in duplicate ... Form\n315.... Impossible to forecast the extent to which the War Department\nmay ultimately utilize the services which you and thousands of others\nhave so generously offered ... Form ... Form.... Not to be construed as\nmeaning that you have been permanently rejected ... Form ... Advise you\nthat while at the present time the War Department is unable to use\nyou....\"\n\n\"Wouldn't that fry you to a crisp?\" Kinnison demanded. \"What in hell\nhave they got in their heads--sawdust? They think that because I'm fifty\none years old I've got one foot in the grave--I'll bet four dollars that\nI'm in better shape than that cursed Major General and his whole damned\nstaff!\"\n\n\"I don't doubt it, dear.\" Eunice's smile was, however, mostly of\nrelief. \"But here's an ad--it's been running for a week.\"\n\n\"CHEMICAL ENGINEERS ... shell loading plant ... within seventy-five\nmiles of Townville ... over five years experience ... organic chemistry\n... technology ... explosives....\"\n\n\"They want _you_,\" Eunice declared, soberly.\n\n\"Well, I'm a Ph.D. in Organic. I've had more than five years experience\nin both organic chemistry and technology. If I don't know something\nabout explosives I did a smart job of fooling Dean Montrose, back at\nGosh Whatta University. I'll write 'em a letter.\"\n\nHe wrote. He filled out a form. The telephone rang.\n\n\"Kinnison speaking ... yes ... Dr. Sumner? Oh, yes, Chief Chemist....\nThat's it--one year over age, so I thought.... Oh, that's a minor\nmatter. We won't starve. If you can't pay a hundred and fifty I'll come\nfor a hundred, or seventy five, or fifty.... That's all right, too. I'm\nwell enough known in my own field so that a title of Junior Chemical\nEngineer wouldn't hurt me a bit ... O.K., I'll see you about one o'clock\n... Stoner and Black, Inc., Operators, Entwhistle Ordnance Plant,\nEntwhistle, Missikota.... What! Well, maybe I could, at that....\nGoodbye.\"\n\nHe turned to his wife. \"You know what? They want me to come down right\naway and go to work. Hot Dog! _Am_ I glad that I told that louse\nHendricks exactly where he could stick that job of mine!\"\n\n\"He must have known that you wouldn't sign a straight-salary contract\nafter getting a share of the profits so long. Maybe he believed what you\nalways say just before or just after kicking somebody's teeth down their\nthroats; that you're so meek and mild--a regular Milquetoast. Do you\nreally think that they'll want you back, after the war?\" It was clear\nthat Eunice was somewhat concerned concerning Kinnison's joblessness;\nbut Kinnison was not.\n\n\"Probably. That's the gossip. And I'll come back--when hell freezes\nover.\" His square jaw tightened. \"I've heard of outfits stupid enough to\nlet their technical brains go because they could sell--for a\nwhile--anything they produced, but I didn't know that I was working for\none. Maybe I'm not exactly a Timid Soul, but you'll have to admit that I\nnever kicked anybody's teeth out unless they tried to kick mine out\nfirst.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEntwhistle Ordnance Plant covered twenty-odd square miles of more or\nless level land. Ninety-nine percent of its area was \"Inside the fence.\"\nMost of the buildings within that restricted area, while in reality\nenormous, were dwarfed by the vast spaces separating them; for\nsafety-distances are not small when TNT and tetryl by the ton are\ninvolved. Those structures were built of concrete, steel, glass,\ntransite, and tile.\n\n\"Outside the Fence\" was different. This was the Administration Area. Its\nbuildings were tremendous wooden barracks, relatively close together,\npacked with the executive, clerical, and professional personnel\nappropriate to an organization employing over twenty thousand men and\nwomen.\n\nWell inside the fence, but a safety-distance short of the One Line--Loading\nLine Number One--was a long, low building, quite inadequately named the\nChemical Laboratory. \"Inadequately\" in that the Chief Chemist, a highly\ncapable--if more than a little cantankerous--Explosives Engineer, had\nalready gathered into his Chemical Section most of Development, most\nof Engineering, and all of Physics, Weights and Measures, and Weather.\n\nOne room of the Chemical Laboratory--in the corner most distant from\nAdministration--was separated from the rest of the building by a\nsixteen-inch wall of concrete and steel extending from foundation to\nroof without a door, window, or other opening. This was the laboratory\nof the Chemical Engineers, the boys who played with explosives high and\nlow; any explosion occurring therein could not affect the Chemical\nLaboratory proper or its personnel.\n\nEntwhistle's main roads were paved; but in February of 1942, such minor\nitems as sidewalks existed only on the blue-prints. Entwhistle's soil\ncontained much clay, and at that time the mud was approximately six\ninches deep. Hence, since there were neither inside doors nor sidewalks,\nit was only natural that the technologists did not visit at all\nfrequently the polished-tile cleanliness of the Laboratory. It was also\nnatural enough for the far larger group to refer to the segregated ones\nas exiles and outcasts; and that some witty chemist applied to that\nisolated place the name \"Siberia.\"\n\nThe name stuck. More, the Engineers seized it and acclaimed it. They\nwere Siberians, and proud of it, and Siberians they remained; long after\nEntwhistle's mud turned into dust. And within the year the Siberians\nwere to become well and favorably known in every ordnance plant in the\ncountry, to many high executives who had no idea of how the name\noriginated.\n\nKinnison became a Siberian as enthusiastically as the youngest man\nthere. The term \"youngest\" is used in its exact sense, for not one of\nthem was a recent graduate. Each had had at least five years of\nresponsible experience, and \"Cappy\" Sumner kept on building. He hired\nextravagantly and fired ruthlessly--to the minds of some, senselessly.\nBut he knew what he was doing. He knew explosives, and he knew men. He\nwas not liked, but he was respected. His building was good.\n\nBeing one of the only two \"old\" men there--and the other did not stay\nlong--Kinnison, as a Junior Chemical Engineer, was not at first accepted\nwithout reserve. Apparently he did not notice that fact, but went\nquietly about his assigned duties. He was meticulously careful with, but\nvery evidently not in any fear of, the materials with which he worked.\nHe pelleted and tested tracer, igniter, and incendiary compositions; he\ntook his turn at burning out rejects. Whenever asked, he went out on the\nlines with any one of them.\n\nHis experimental tetryls always \"miked\" to size, his TNT\nmelt-pours--introductory to loading forty-millimeter on the Three\nLine--came out solid, free from checks and cavitations. It became\nevident to those young but keen minds that he, alone of them all, was on\nfamiliar ground. They began to discuss their problems with him. Out of\nhis years of technological experience, and by bringing everyone present\ninto the discussion, he either helped them directly or helped them to\nhelp themselves. His stature grew.\n\nBlack-haired, black-eyed \"Tug\" Tugwell, two hundred pounds of\nex-football-player in charge of tracer on the Seven Line, called him\n\"Uncle\" Ralph, and the habit spread. And in a couple of weeks--at about\nthe same time that \"Injun\" Abernathy was slightly injured by being blown\nthrough a door by a minor explosion of his igniter on the Eight line--he\nwas promoted to full Chemical Engineer; a promotion which went\nunnoticed, since it involved only changes in title and salary.\n\nThree weeks later, however, he was made Senior Chemical Engineer, in\ncharge of Melt-Pour. At this there was a celebration, led by \"Blondie\"\nWanacek, a sulphuric-acid expert handling tetryl on the Two. Kinnison\nsearched minutely for signs of jealousy or antagonism, but could find\nnone. He went blithely to work on the Six line, where they wanted to\nstart pouring twenty-pound fragmentation bombs, ably assisted by Tug and\nby two new men. One of these was \"Doc\" or \"Bart\" Barton, who, the\ngrapevine said, had been hired by Cappy to be his Assistant. His motto,\nlike that of Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, was to run and find out, and he did so\nwith glee and abandon. He was a good egg. So was the other newcomer,\n\"Charley\" Charlevoix, a prematurely gray paint-and-lacquer expert who\nhad also made the Siberian grade.\n\nA few months later, Sumner called Kinnison into the office. The latter\nwent, wondering what the old hard-shell was going to cry about now; for\nto be called into that office meant only one thing--censure.\n\n\"Kinnison, I like your work,\" the Chief Chemist began, gruffly, and\nKinnison's mouth almost dropped open. \"Anybody who ever got a Ph.D.\nunder Montrose would have to know explosives, and the F.B.I. report on\nyou showed that you had brains, ability, and guts. But none of that\nexplains how you can get along so well with those damned Siberians. I\nwant to make you Assistant Chief and put you in charge of Siberia.\nFormally, I mean--actually, you have been for months.\"\n\n\"Why, no ... I didn't.... Besides, how about Barton? He's too good a man\nto kick in the teeth that way.\"\n\n\"Admitted.\" This _did_ surprise Kinnison. He had never thought that the\nirascible and tempestuous Chief would ever confess to a mistake. This\nwas a Cappy he had never known. \"I discussed it with him yesterday. He's\na damned good man--but it's decidedly questionable whether he has got\nwhatever it is that made Tugwell, Wanacek and Charlevoix work straight\nthrough for seventy two hours, napping now and then on benches and\ngrabbing coffee and sandwiches when they could, until they got that frag\nbomb straightened out.\"\n\nSumner did not mention the fact that Kinnison had worked straight\nthrough, too. That was taken for granted.\n\n\"Well, I don't know.\" Kinnison's head was spinning. \"I'd like to check\nwith Barton first. O.K.?\"\n\n\"I expected that. O.K.\"\n\nKinnison found Barton and led him out behind the testing shed.\n\n\"Bart, Cappy tells me that he figures on kicking you in the face by\nmaking me Assistant and that you O.K.'d it. One word and I'll tell the\nold buzzard just where to stick the job and exactly where to go to do\nit.\"\n\n\"Reaction, perfect. Yield, one hundred percent.\" Barton stuck out his\nhand. \"Otherwise, I would tell him all that myself and more. As it is,\nUncle Ralph, smooth out the ruffled plumage. They'd go to hell for you,\nwading in standing straight up--they might do the same with me in the\ndriver's seat, and they might not. Why take a chance? You're IT. Some\nthings about the deal I don't like, of course--but at that, it makes me\nabout the only man working for Stoner and Black who can get a release\nany time a good permanent job breaks. I'll stick until then. O.K.?\" It\nwas unnecessary for Barton to add that as long as he was there he would\nreally work.\n\n\"I'll say it's O.K.!\" and Kinnison reported to Sumner.\n\n\"All right, Chief, I'll try it--if you can square it with the\nSiberians.\"\n\n\"That will not be too difficult.\"\n\nNor was it. The Siberians' reaction brought a lump to Kinnison's throat.\n\n\"Ralph the First, Czar of Siberia!\" they yelled. \"Long live the Czar!\nKowtow, serfs and vassals, to Czar Ralph the First!\"\n\nKinnison was still glowing when he got home that night, to the\nGovernment Housing Project and to the three-room \"mansionette\" in which\nhe and Eunice lived. He would never forget the events of that day.\n\n\"What a gang! _What_ a gang! But listen, ace--they work under their own\npower--you couldn't _keep_ those kids from working. Why should I get the\ncredit for what they do?\"\n\n\"I haven't the foggiest.\" Eunice wrinkled her forehead--and her\nnose--but the corners of her mouth quirked up. \"Are you quite sure that\nyou haven't had _anything_ to do with it? But supper is ready--let's\neat.\"\n\nMore months passed. Work went on. Absorbing work, and highly varied; the\ndetails of which are of no importance here. Paul Jones, a big, hard,\ntop-drawer chicle technologist, set up the Four line to pour demolition\nblocks. Frederick Hinton came in, qualified as a Siberian, and went to\nwork on Anti-Personnel mines.\n\nKinnison was promoted again: to Chief Chemist. He and Sumner had never\nbeen friendly; he made no effort to find out why Cappy had quit, or had\nbeen terminated, whichever it was. This promotion made no difference.\nBarton, now Assistant, ran the whole Chemical Section save for one\nunit--Siberia--and did a superlative job. The Chief Chemist's secretary\nworked for Barton, not for Kinnison. Kinnison was the Czar of Siberia.\n\nThe Anti-Personnel mines had been giving trouble. Too many men were\nbeing killed by prematures, and nobody could find out why. The problem\nwas handed to Siberia. Hinton tackled it, missed, and called for help.\nThe Siberians rallied round. Kinnison loaded and tested mines. So did\nPaul and Tug and Blondie. Kinnison was testing, out in the Firing Area,\nwhen he was called to Administration to attend a Staff Meeting. Hinton\nrelieved him. He had not reached the gate, however, when a guard car\nflagged him down.\n\n\"Sorry, sir, but there has been an accident at Pit Five and you are\nneeded out there.\"\n\n\"Accident! Fred Hinton! Is he...?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid so, sir.\"\n\nIt is a harrowing thing to have to help gather up what fragments can be\nfound of one of your best friends. Kinnison was white and sick as he got\nback to the firing station, just in time to hear the Chief Safety\nOfficer say:\n\n\"Must have been carelessness--rank carelessness. I warned this man\nHinton myself, on one occasion.\"\n\n\"Carelessness, hell!\" Kinnison blazed. \"You had the guts to warn _me_\nonce, too, and I've forgotten more about safety in explosives than you\never will know. Fred Hinton was _not_ careless--if I hadn't been called\nin, that would have been me.\"\n\n\"What is it, then?\"\n\n\"I don't know--yet. I tell you now, though, Major Moulton, that I _will_\nknow, and the minute I find out I'll talk to you again.\"\n\nHe went back to Siberia, where he found Tug and Paul, faces still\ntear-streaked, staring at something that looked like a small piece of\nwire.\n\n\"This is it, Uncle Ralph,\" Tug said, brokenly. \"Don't see how it could\nbe, but it is.\"\n\n\"What is what?\" Kinnison demanded.\n\n\"Firing pin. Brittle. When you pull the safety, the force of the spring\nmust break it off at this constricted section here.\"\n\n\"But damn it, Tug, it doesn't make sense. It's tension ... but\nwait--there'd be some horizontal component, at that. But they'd have to\nbe brittle as glass.\"\n\n\"I know it. It doesn't seem to make much sense. But we were there, you\nknow--and I assembled every one of those God damned mines myself.\nNothing else could possibly have made that mine go off just when it\ndid.\"\n\n\"O.K., Tug. We'll test 'em. Call Bart in--he can have the scale-lab boys\nrig us up a gadget by the time we can get some more of those pins in off\nthe line.\"\n\nThey tested a hundred, under the normal tension of the spring, and three\nof them broke. They tested another hundred. Five broke. They stared at\neach other.\n\n\"That's it.\" Kinnison declared. \"But this will stink to high\nHeaven--have Inspection break out a new lot and we'll test a thousand.\"\n\nOf that thousand pins, thirty two broke.\n\n\"Bart, will you dictate a one-page preliminary report to Vera and rush\nit over to Building One as fast as you can? I'll go over and tell\nMoulton a few things.\"\n\nMajor Moulton was, as usual, \"in conference,\" but Kinnison was in no\nmood to wait.\n\n\"Tell him,\" he instructed the Major's private secretary, who had barred\nhis way, \"that either he will talk to me right now or I will call\nDistrict Safety over his head. I'll give him sixty seconds to decide\nwhich.\"\n\nMoulton decided to see him. \"I'm very busy, Doctor Kinnison, but....\"\n\n\"I don't give a swivel-eyed tinker's damn how busy you are. I told you\nthat the minute I found out what was the matter with the M2 mine I'd\ntalk to you again. Here I am. Brittle firing pins. Three and two-tenths\npercent defective. So I'm....\"\n\n\"Very irregular, Doctor. The matter will have to go through\nchannels....\"\n\n\"Not this one. The formal report is going through channels, but as I\nstarted to tell you, this is an emergency report to you as Chief of\nSafety. Since the defect is not covered by specs, neither Process nor\nOrdnance can reject except by test, and whoever does the testing will\nvery probably be killed. Therefore, as every employee of Stoner and\nBlack is not only authorized but positively instructed to do upon\ndiscovering an unsafe condition, I am reporting it direct to Safety.\nSince my whiskers are a trifle longer than an operator's, I am reporting\nit direct to the Head of the Safety Division; and I am telling you that\nif you don't do something about it damned quick--stop production and\nslap a HOLD order on all the M2AP's you can reach--I'll call District\nand make you personally responsible for every premature that occurs from\nnow on.\"\n\nSince any safety man, anywhere, would much rather stop a process than\nauthorize one, and since this particular safety man loved to throw his\nweight around, Kinnison was surprised that Moulton did not act\ninstantly. The fact that he did not so act should have, but did not,\ngive the naive Kinnison much information as to conditions existing\nOutside the Fence.\n\n\"But they need those mines very badly; they are an item of very heavy\nproduction. If we stop them ... how long? Have you any suggestions?\"\n\n\"Yes. Call District and have them rush through a change of spec--include\nheat-treat and a modified Charpy test. In the meantime, we can get back\ninto full production tomorrow if you have District slap a\nhundred-per-cent inspection onto those pins.\"\n\n\"Excellent! We can do that--very fine work, Doctor! Miss Morgan, get\nDistrict at once!\"\n\nThis, too, should have warned Kinnison, but it did not. He went back to\nthe Laboratory.\n\nTempus fugited.\n\nOrders came to get ready to load M67 H.E., A.T. (105 m/m High Explosive,\nArmor Tearing) shell on the Nine, and the Siberians went joyously to\nwork upon the new load. The explosive was to be a mixture of TNT and a\npolysyllabic compound, everything about which was highly confidential\nand restricted.\n\n\"But what the hell's so hush-hush about _that_ stuff?\" demanded Blondie,\nwho, with five or six others, was crowding around the Czar's desk.\nUnlike the days of Cappy Sumner, the private office of the Chief Chemist\nwas now as much Siberia as Siberia itself. \"The Germans developed it\noriginally, didn't they?\"\n\n\"Yes, and the Italians used it against the Ethiopians--which was why\ntheir bombs were so effective. But it says 'hush-hush,' so that's the\nway it will be. And if you talk in your sleep, Blondie, tell Betty not\nto listen.\"\n\nThe Siberians worked. The M67 was put into production. It was such a\nsuccess that orders for it came in faster than they could be filled.\nProduction was speeded up. Small cavitations began to appear. Nothing\nserious, since they passed Inspection. Nevertheless, Kinnison protested,\nin a formal report, receipt of which was formally acknowledged.\n\nGeneral Somebody-or-other, Entwhistle's Commanding Officer, whom none of\nthe Siberians had ever met, was transferred to more active duty, and a\ncolonel--Snodgrass or some such name--took his place. Ordnance got a new\nChief Inspector.\n\nAn M67, Entwhistle loaded, prematured in a gun-barrel, killing twenty\nseven men. Kinnison protested again, verbally this time, at a staff\nmeeting. He was assured--verbally--that a formal and thorough\ninvestigation was being made. Later he was informed--verbally and\nwithout witnesses--that the investigation had been completed and that\nthe loading was not at fault. A new Commanding Officer--Lieutenant-Colonel\nFranklin--appeared.\n\nThe Siberians, too busy to do more than glance at newspapers, paid very\nlittle attention to a glider-crash in which several notables were\nkilled. They heard that an investigation was being made, but even the\nCzar did not know until later that Washington had for once acted fast\nin correcting a bad situation; that Inspection, which had been under\nProduction, was summarily divorced therefrom. And gossip spread abroad\nthat Stillman, then Head of the Inspection Division, was not a big\nenough man for the job. Thus it was an entirely unsuspecting Kinnison\nwho was called into the innermost private office of Thomas Keller, the\nSuperintendent of Production.\n\n\"Kinnison, how in hell do you handle those Siberians? I never saw\nanything like them before in my life.\"\n\n\"No, and you never will again. Nothing on Earth except a war could get\nthem together or hold them together. I don't 'handle' them--they can't\nbe 'handled'. I give them a job to do and let them do it. I back them\nup. That's all.\"\n\n\"Umngpf.\" Keller grunted. \"That's a hell of a formula--if I want\nanything done right I've got to do it myself. But whatever your system\nis, it works. But what I wanted to talk to you about is, how'd you like\nto be Head of the Inspection Division, which would be enlarged to\ninclude your present Chemical Section?\"\n\n\"Huh?\" Kinnison demanded, dumbfounded.\n\n\"At a salary well up on the confidential scale.\" Keller wrote a figure\nupon a piece of paper, showed it to his visitor, then burned it in an\nash-tray.\n\nKinnison whistled. \"I'd like it--for more reasons than that. But I\ndidn't know that you--or have you already checked with the General and\nMr. Black?\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" came the smooth reply. \"In fact, I suggested it to them and\nhave their approval. Perhaps you are curious to know why?\"\n\n\"I certainly am.\"\n\n\"For two reasons. First, because you have developed a crew of technical\nexperts that is the envy of every technical man in the country. Second,\nyou and your Siberians have done every job I ever asked you to, and done\nit fast. As a Division Head, you will no longer be under me, but I am\nright, I think, in assuming that you will work with me just as\nefficiently as you do now?\"\n\n\"I can't think of any reason why I wouldn't.\" This reply was made in all\nhonesty; but later, when he came to understand what Keller had meant,\nhow bitterly Kinnison was to regret its making!\n\nHe moved into Stillman's office, and found there what he thought was\nample reason for his predecessor's failure to make good. To his way of\nthinking it was tremendously over-staffed, particularly with Assistant\nChief Inspectors. Delegation of authority, so widely preached\nthroughout Entwhistle Ordnance Plant, had not been given even lip\nservice here. Stillman had not made a habit of visiting the lines; nor\ndid the Chief Line Inspectors, the boys who really knew what was going\non, ever visit him. They reported to the Assistants, who reported to\nStillman, who handed down his Jovian pronouncements.\n\nKinnison set out, deliberately this time, to mold his key Chief Line\nInspectors into just such a group as the Siberians already were. He\nreleased the Assistants to more productive work; retaining of Stillman's\noffice staff only a few clerks and his private secretary, one Celeste de\nSt. Aubin, a dynamic, vivacious--at times explosive--brunette. He gave\nthe boys on the Lines full authority; the few who could not handle the\nload he replaced with men who could. At first the Chief Line Inspectors\nsimply could not believe; but after the affair of the forty millimeter,\nin which Kinnison rammed the decision of his subordinate past Keller,\npast the General, past Stoner and Black, and clear up to the Commanding\nOfficer before he made it stick, they were his to a man.\n\nOthers of his Section Heads, however, remained aloof. Pettler, whose\nTechnical Section was now part of Inspection, and Wilson, of Gages, were\ntwo of those who talked largely and glowingly, but acted obstructively\nif they acted at all. As weeks went on, Kinnison became wiser and wiser,\nbut made no sign. One day, during a lull, his secretary hung out the \"In\nConference\" sign and went into Kinnison's private office.\n\n\"There isn't a reference to any such Investigation anywhere in Central\nFiles.\" She paused, as if to add something, then turned to leave.\n\n\"As you were, Celeste. Sit down. I expected that. Suppressed--if made at\nall. You're a smart girl, Celeste, and you know the ropes. You know that\nyou can talk to me, don't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, but this is ... well, the word is going around that they are going\nto break you, just as they have broken every other good man on the\nReservation.\"\n\n\"I expected that, too.\" The words were quiet enough, but the man's jaw\ntightened. \"Also, I know how they are going to do it.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"This speed-up on the Nine. They know that I won't stand still for the\nkind of casts that Keller's new procedure, which goes into effect\ntonight, is going to produce ... and this new C.O. probably will.\"\n\nSilence fell, broken by the secretary.\n\n\"General Sanford, our first C.O., was a soldier, and a good one,\" she\ndeclared finally. \"So was Colonel Snodgrass. Lieutenant Colonel Franklin\nwasn't; but he was too much of a man to do the dir ...\"\n\n\"Dirty work,\" dryly. \"Exactly. Go on.\"\n\n\"And Stoner, the New York half--ninety five percent, really--of Stoner\nand Black, Inc., is a Big Time Operator. So we get this damned\nnincompoop of a major, who doesn't know a f-u-s-e from a f-u-z-e, direct\nfrom a Wall Street desk.\"\n\n\"So what?\" One must have heard Ralph Kinnison say those two words to\nrealize how much meaning they can be made to carry.\n\n\"So what!\" the girl blazed, wringing her hands. \"Ever since you have\nbeen over here I have been expecting you to blow up--to smash\nsomething--in spite of the dozens of times you have told me 'a fighter\ncan not slug effectively, Celeste, until he gets both feet firmly\nplanted.' When--_when_--are you going to get your feet planted?\"\n\n\"Never, I'm afraid,\" he said glumly, and she stared. \"So I'll have to\nstart slugging with at least one foot in the air.\"\n\nThat startled her. \"Explain, please?\"\n\n\"I wanted _proof_. Stuff that I could take to the District--that I could\nuse to tack some hides out flat on a barn door with. Do I get it? I do\nnot. Not a shred. Neither can you. What chance do you think there is of\never getting any real proof?\"\n\n\"Very little,\" Celeste admitted. \"But you can at least smash Pettler,\nWilson, and that crowd. _How_ I hate those slimy snakes! I wish that you\ncould smash Tom Keller, the poisonous moron!\"\n\n\"Not so much moron--although he acts like one at times--as an ignorant\npuppet with a head swelled three sizes too big for his hat. But you can\nquit yapping about slugging--fireworks are due to start at two o'clock\ntomorrow afternoon, when Drake is going to reject tonight's run of\nshell.\"\n\n\"Really? But I don't see how either Pettler or Wilson come in.\"\n\n\"They don't. A fight with those small fry--even smashing them--wouldn't\nmake enough noise. Keller.\"\n\n\"Keller!\" Celeste squealed. \"But you'll....\"\n\n\"I know I'll get fired. So what? By tackling him I can raise enough hell\nso that the Big Shots will have to cut out at least some of the rough\nstuff. You'll probably get fired too, you know--you've been too close to\nme for your own good.\"\n\n\"Not me.\" She shook her head vigorously. \"The minute they terminate you,\nI quit. Poof! Who cares? Besides, I can get a better job in Townville.\"\n\n\"Without leaving the Project. That's what I figured. It's the boys I'm\nworried about. I've been getting them ready for this for weeks.\"\n\n\"But they will quit, too. Your Siberians--your Inspectors--of a surety\nthey will quit, every one!\"\n\n\"They won't release them; and what Stoner and Black will do to them,\neven after the war, if they quit without releases, shouldn't be done to\na dog. They won't quit, either--at least if they don't try to push them\naround too much. Keller's mouth is watering to get hold of Siberia, but\nhe'll never make it, nor any one of his stooges.... I'd better dictate a\nmemorandum to Black on that now, while I'm calm and collected; telling\nhim what he'll have to do to keep my boys from tearing Entwhistle\napart.\"\n\n\"But do you think he will pay any attention to it?\"\n\n\"I'll say he will!\" Kinnison snorted. \"Don't kid yourself about Black,\nCeleste. He's a smart man, and before this is done he'll know that he'll\nhave to keep his nose clean.\"\n\n\"But you--how can you do it?\" Celeste marveled. \"Me, I would urge them\non. Few would have the patriotism....\"\n\n\"Patriotism, hell! If that were all, I would have stirred up a\nrevolution long ago. It's for the boys, in years to come. They've got to\nkeep _their_ noses clean, too. Get your notebook, please, and take this\ndown. Rough draft--I'm going to polish it up until it has teeth and\nclaws in every line.\"\n\nAnd that evening, after supper, he informed Eunice of all the new\ndevelopments.\n\n\"Is it still O.K. with you,\" he concluded, \"for me to get myself fired\noff of this high-salaried job of mine?\"\n\n\"Certainly. Being you, how can you do anything else? Oh, how I wish I\ncould wring their necks!\" That conversation went on and on, but\nadditional details are not necessary here.\n\nShortly after two o'clock of the following afternoon, Celeste took a\ncall; and listened shamelessly.\n\n\"Kinnison speaking.\"\n\n\"Tug, Uncle Ralph. The casts sectioned just like we thought they would.\nDead ringers for Plate D. So Drake hung a red ticket on every tray.\nPiddy was right there, waiting, and started to raise hell. So I chipped\nin, and he beat it so fast that I looked to see his coat-tail catch\nfire. Drake didn't quite like to call you, so I did. If Piddy keeps on\ngoing at the rate he left here, he'll be in Keller's office in nothing\nflat.\"\n\n\"O.K., Tug. Tell Drake that the shell he rejected are going to stay\nrejected, and to come in right now with his report. Would you like to\ncome along?\"\n\n\"_Would_ I!\" Tugwell hung up and:\n\n\"But do you want _him_ here, Doc?\" Celeste asked, anxiously, without\nconsidering whether or not her boss would approve of her eavesdropping.\n\n\"I certainly do. If I can keep Tug from blowing his top, the rest of the\nboys will stay in line.\"\n\nA few minutes later Tugwell strode in, bringing with him Drake, the\nChief Line Inspector of the Nine Line. Shortly thereafter the office\ndoor was wrenched open. Keller had come to Kinnison, accompanied by the\nSuperintendent whom the Siberians referred to, somewhat contemptuously,\nas \"Piddy.\"\n\n\"Damn your soul, Kinnison, come out here--I want to talk to you!\" Keller\nroared, and doors snapped open up and down the long corridor.\n\n\"Shut up, you God damned louse!\" This from Tugwell, who, black eyes\nalmost emitting sparks, was striding purposefully forward. \"I'll sock\nyou so damned hard that....\"\n\n\"Pipe down, Tug, I'll handle this.\" Kinnison's voice was not loud, but\nit had then a peculiarly carrying and immensely authoritative quality.\n\"Verbally or physically; however he wants to have it.\"\n\nHe turned to Keller, who had jumped backward into the hall to avoid the\nyoung Siberian.\n\n\"As for you, Keller, if you had the brains that God gave bastard geese\nin Ireland, you would have had this conference in private. Since you\nstarted it in public, however, I'll finish it in public. How you came to\npick _me_ for a yes-man I'll never know--just one more measure of your\nstupidity, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Those shell are perfect!\" Keller shouted. \"Tell Drake here to pass\nthem, right now. If you don't, by God I'll....\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" Kinnison's voice cut. \"I'll do the talking--you listen. The\nspec says quote shall be free from objectionable cavitation unquote. The\nLine Inspectors, who know their stuff, say that those cavitations are\nobjectionable. So do the Chemical Engineers. Therefore, as far as I am\nconcerned, they are objectionable. Those shell are rejected, and they\nwill _stay_ rejected.\"\n\n\"That's what _you_ think,\" Keller raged. \"But there'll be a new Head of\nInspection, who will pass them, tomorrow morning!\"\n\n\"In that you may be half right. When you get done licking Black's boots,\ntell him that I am in my office.\"\n\nKinnison re-entered his suite. Keller, swearing, strode away with Piddy.\nDoors clicked shut.\n\n\"I _am_ going to quit, Uncle Ralph, law or no law!\" Tugwell stormed.\n\"They'll run that bunch of crap through, and then....\"\n\n\"Will you promise not to quit until they do?\" Kinnison asked, quietly.\n\n\"Huh?\" \"What?\" Tugwell's eyes--and Celeste's--were pools of\nastonishment. Celeste, being on the inside, understood first.\n\n\"Oh--to keep his nose clean--I see!\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"Exactly. Those shell will not be accepted, nor any like them. On the\nsurface, we got licked. I will get fired. You will find, however, that\nwe won this particular battle. And if you boys stay here and hang\ntogether and keep on slugging you can win a lot more.\"\n\n\"Maybe, if we raise enough hell, we can make them fire us, too?\" Drake\nsuggested.\n\n\"I doubt it. But unless I'm wrong, you can just about write your own\nticket from now on, if you play it straight.\" Kinnison grinned to\nhimself, at something which the young people could not see.\n\n\"You told me what Stoner and Black would do to us,\" Tugwell said,\nintensely. \"What I'm afraid of is that they'll do it to you.\"\n\n\"They can't. Not a chance in the world,\" Kinnison assured him. \"You\nfellows are young--not established. But I'm well-enough known in my own\nfield so that if they tried to black-ball me they'd just get themselves\nlaughed at, and they know it. So beat it back to the Nine, you kids, and\nhang red tickets on everything that doesn't cross-section up to\nstandard. Tell the gang goodbye for me--I'll keep you posted.\"\n\nIn less than an hour Kinnison was called into the Office of the\nPresident. He was completely at ease; Black was not.\n\n\"It has been decided to ... uh ... ask for your resignation,\" the\nPresident announced at last.\n\n\"Save your breath,\" Kinnison advised. \"I came down here to do a job, and\nthe only way you can keep me from doing that job is to fire me.\"\n\n\"That was not ... uh ... entirely unexpected. A difficulty arose,\nhowever, in deciding what reason to put on your termination papers.\"\n\n\"I can well believe that. You can put down anything you like,\" Kinnison\nshrugged, \"with one exception. Any implication of incompetence and\nyou'll have to prove it in court.\"\n\n\"Incompatibility, say?\"\n\n\"O.K.\"\n\n\"Miss Briggs--'Incompatibility with the highest echelon of Stoner and\nBlack, Inc.,' please. You may as well wait, Dr. Kinnison; it will take\nonly a moment.\"\n\n\"Fine. I've got a couple of things to say. First, I know as well as you\ndo that you're between Scylla and Charybdis--damned if you do and damned\nif you don't.\"\n\n\"Certainly not! Ridiculous!\" Black blustered, but his eyes wavered.\n\"Where did you get such a preposterous idea? What do you mean?\"\n\n\"If you ram those sub-standard H.E.A.T. shell through, you are going to\nhave some more prematures. Not many--the stuff is actually almost good\nenough--one in ten thousand, say: perhaps one in fifty thousand. But you\nknow damned well that you can't afford _any_. What my Siberians and\nInspectors know about you and Keller and Piddy and the Nine Line would\nbe enough; but to cap the climax that brainless jackal of yours let the\ncat completely out of the bag this afternoon, and everybody in Building\nOne was listening. One more premature would blow Entwhistle wide\nopen--would start something that not all the politicians in Washington\ncould stop. On the other hand, if you scrap those lots and go back to\npouring good loads, your Mr. Stoner, of New York and Washington, will be\nvery unhappy and will scream bloody murder. I'm sure, however, that you\nwon't offer any Plate D loads to Ordnance--in view of the temper of my\nboys and girls, and the number of people who heard your dumb stooge give\nyou away, you won't dare to. In fact, I told some of my people that you\nwouldn't; that you are a smart enough operator to keep your nose clean.\"\n\n\"You _told_ them!\" Black shouted, in anger and dismay.\n\n\"Yes? Why not?\" The words were innocent enough, but Kinnison's\nexpression was full of meaning. \"I don't want to seem trite, but you are\njust beginning to find out that honesty and loyalty are a hell of a hard\nteam to beat.\"\n\n\"Get out! Take these termination papers and GET OUT!\"\n\nAnd Doctor Ralph K. Kinnison, head high, strode out of President Black's\noffice and out of Entwhistle Ordnance Plant.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\n19--?\n\n\n\"Theodore K. Kinnison!\" a crisp, clear voice snapped from the speaker of\nan apparently cold, ordinary-enough-looking radio-television set.\n\nA burly young man caught his breath sharply as he leaped to the\ninstrument and pressed an inconspicuous button.\n\n\"Theodore K. Kinnison acknowledging!\" The plate remained dark, but he\nknew that he was being scanned.\n\n\"Operation Bullfinch!\" the speaker blatted.\n\nKinnison gulped. \"Operation Bullfinch--Off!\" he managed to say.\n\n\"Off!\"\n\nHe pushed the button again and turned to face the tall, trim\nhoney-blonde who stood tensely poised in the archway. Her eyes were wide\nand protesting; both hands clutched at her throat.\n\n\"Uh-huh, sweets, they're coming--over the Pole,\" he gritted. \"Two hours,\nmore or less.\"\n\n\"Oh, Ted!\" She threw herself into his arms. They kissed, then broke\naway.\n\nThe man picked up two large suitcases, already packed--everything else,\nincluding food and water, had been in the car for weeks--and made\nstrides. The girl rushed after him, not bothering even to close the door\nof the apartment, scooping up _en passant_ a leggy boy of four and a\nchubby, curly-haired girl of two or thereabouts. They ran across the\nlawn toward a big, low-slung sedan.\n\n\"Sure you got your caffeine tablets?\" he demanded as they ran.\n\n\"Uh-huh.\"\n\n\"You'll need 'em. Drive like the devil--_stay ahead_! You can--this heap\nhas got the legs of a centipede and you've got plenty of gas and oil.\nEleven hundred miles from anywhere and a population of one-tenth per\nsquare mile--you'll be safe there if anybody is.\"\n\n\"It isn't us I'm worried about--it's you!\" she panted. \"Technos' wives\nget a few minutes' notice ahead of the H-blast--I'll be ahead of the\nrush and I'll stay ahead. It's you, Ted--_you_!\"\n\n\"Don't worry, keed. That popcycle of mine has got legs, too, and there\nwon't be so much traffic, the way I'm going.\"\n\n\"Oh, blast! I didn't mean that, and you know it!\"\n\nThey were at the car. While he jammed the two bags into an\nexactly-fitting space, she tossed the children into the front seat, slid\nlithely under the wheel, and started the engine.\n\n\"I know you didn't, sweetheart. I'll be back.\" He kissed her and the\nlittle girl, the while shaking hands with his son. \"Kidlets, you and\nmother are going out to visit Grand-dad Kinnison, like we told you all\nabout. Lots of fun. I'll be along later. Now, Lady Lead-Foot, scram--and\nshovel on the coal!\"\n\nThe heavy vehicle backed and swung; gravel flew as the accelerator-pedal\nhit the floor.\n\nKinnison galloped across the alley and opened the door of a small\ngarage, revealing a long, squat motorcycle. Two deft passes of his hands\nand two of his three spotlights were no longer white--one flashed a\nbrilliant purple, the other a searing blue. He dropped a perforated\nmetal box into a hanger and flipped a switch--a peculiarly-toned siren\nbegan its ululating shriek. He took the alley turn at an angle of\nforty-five degrees; burned the pavement toward Diversey.\n\nThe light was red. No matter--everybody had stopped--that siren could be\nheard for miles. He barreled into the intersection; his step-plate\nground the concrete as he made a screaming left turn.\n\nA siren--creeping up from behind. City tone. Two red spots--city cop--so\nsoon--good! He cut his gun a trifle, the other bike came alongside.\n\n\"Is this IT?\" the uniformed rider yelled, over the coughing thunder of\nthe competing exhausts.\n\n\"Yes!\" Kinnison yelled back. \"Clear Diversey to the Outer Drive, and the\nDrive south to Gary and north to Waukegan. Snap it up!\"\n\nThe white-and-black motorcycle slowed; shot over toward the curb. The\nofficer reached for his microphone.\n\nKinnison sped on. At Cicero Avenue, although he had a green light,\ntraffic was so heavy that he had to slow down; at Pulaski two policemen\nwaved him through a red. Beyond Sacramento nothing moved on wheels.\n\nSeventy ... seventy five ... he took the bridge at eighty, both wheels\nin air for forty feet. Eighty five ... ninety ... that was about all he\ncould do and keep the heap on so rough a road. Also, he did not have\nDiversey all to himself any more; blue-and-purple-flashing bikes were\ncoming in from every side-street. He slowed to a conservative fifty and\nwent into close formation with the other riders.\n\nThe H-blast--the city-wide warning for the planned and supposedly\norderly evacuation of all Chicago--sounded, but Kinnison did not hear\nit.\n\nAcross the Park, edging over to the left so that the boys going south\nwould have room to make the turn--even such riders as those need _some_\nroom to make a turn at fifty miles per hour!\n\nUnder the viaduct--biting brakes and squealing tires at that sharp,\nnarrow, right-angle left turn--north on the wide, smooth Drive!\n\nThat highway was made for speed. So were those machines. Each rider, as\nhe got into the flat, lay down along his tank, tucked his chin behind\nthe cross-bar, and twisted both throttles out against their stops. They\nwere in a hurry. They had a long way to go; and if they did not get\nthere in time to stop those trans-polar atomic missiles, all hell would\nbe out for noon.\n\nWhy was all this necessary? This organization, this haste, this\nsplit-second timing, this city-wide exhibition of insane hippodrome\nriding? Why were not all these motorcycle-racers stationed permanently\nat their posts, so as to be ready for any emergency? Because America,\nbeing a democracy, could not strike first, but had to wait--wait in\ninstant readiness--until she was actually attacked. Because every good\nTechno in America had his assigned place in some American Defense Plan;\nof which Operation Bullfinch was only one. Because, without the presence\nof those Technos at their every-day jobs, all ordinary technological\nwork in America would perforce have stopped.\n\nA branch road curved away to the right. Scarcely slowing down, Kinnison\nbulleted into the turn and through an open, heavily-guarded gate. Here\nhis mount and his lights were passwords enough: the real test would come\nlater. He approached a towering structure of alloy--jammed on his\nbrakes--stopped beside a soldier who, as soon as Kinnison jumped off,\nmounted the motorcycle and drove it away.\n\nKinnison dashed up to an apparently blank wall, turned his back upon\nfour commissioned officers holding cocked forty-fives at the ready, and\nfitted his right eye into a cup. Unlike fingerprints, retinal patterns\ncannot be imitated, duplicated, or altered; any imposter would have died\ninstantly, without arrest or question. For every man who belonged\naboard that rocket had been checked and tested--_how_ he had been\nchecked and tested!--since one spy, in any one of those Technos' chairs,\ncould wreak damage untellable.\n\nThe port snapped open. Kinnison climbed a ladder into the large, but\ncrowded, Operations Room.\n\n\"Hi, Teddy!\" a yell arose.\n\n\"Hi, Walt! Hi-ya, Red! What-ho, Baldy!\" and so on. These men were\nfriends of old.\n\n\"Where are they?\" he demanded. \"Is our stuff getting away? Lemme take a\npeek at the Ball!\"\n\n\"I'll say it is! O.K., Ted, squeeze in here!\"\n\nHe squeezed in. It was not a ball, but a hemisphere, slightly oblate and\ncentered approximately by the North Pole. A multitude of red dots moved\nslowly--a hundred miles upon that map was a small distance--northward\nover Canada; a closer-packed, less numerous group of yellowish-greens,\nalready on the American side of the Pole, was coming south.\n\nAs had been expected, the Americans had more missiles than did the\nenemy. The other belief, that America had more adequate defenses and\nbetter-trained, more highly skilled defenders, would soon be put to\ntest.\n\nA string of blue lights blazed across the continent, from Nome through\nSkagway and Wallaston and Churchill and Kaniapiskau to Belle Isle;\nAmerica's First Line of Defense. Regulars all. Ambers almost blanketed\nthose blues; their combat rockets were already grabbing altitude. The\nSecond Line, from Portland, Seattle, and Vancouver across to Halifax,\nalso showed solid green, with some flashes of amber. Part Regulars; part\nNational Guard.\n\nChicago was in the Third Line, all National Guard, extending from San\nFrancisco to New York. Green--alert and operating. So were the Fourth,\nthe Fifth, and the Sixth. Operation Bullfinch was clicking; on schedule\nto the second.\n\nA bell clanged; the men sprang to their stations and strapped down.\nEvery chair was occupied. Combat Rocket Number One Oh Six Eight Five,\nfull-powered by the disintegrating nuclei of unstable isotopes, took off\nwith a whooshing roar which even her thick walls could not mute.\n\nThe Technos, crushed down into their form-fitting cushions by three G's\nof acceleration, clenched their teeth and took it.\n\nHigher! Faster! The rocket shivered and trembled as it hit the wall at\nthe velocity of sound, but it did not pause.\n\nHigher! Faster! Higher! Fifty miles high. One hundred ... five hundred\n... a thousand ... fifteen hundred ... two thousand! Half a radius--the\ndesignated altitude at which the Chicago Contingent would go into\naction.\n\nAcceleration was cut to zero. The Technos, breathing deeply in relief,\ndonned peculiarly-goggled helmets and set up their panels.\n\nKinnison stared into his plate with everything he could put into his\noptic nerve. This was not like the Ball, in which the lights were\nelectronically placed, automatically controlled, clear, sharp, and\nsteady. This was radar. A radar considerably different from that of\n1948, of course, and greatly improved, but still pitifully inadequate in\ndealing with objects separated by hundreds of miles and traveling at\nvelocities of thousands of miles per hour!\n\nNor was this like the practice cruises, in which the targets had been\nharmless barrels or equally harmless dirigible rockets. This was the\nreal thing; the targets today would be lethal objects indeed. Practice\ngunnery, with only a place in the Proficiency List at stake, had been\nexciting enough: this was too exciting--_much_ too exciting--for the\nkeenness of brain and the quickness and steadiness of eye and of hand so\nsoon to be required.\n\nA target? Or was it? Yes--three or four of them!\n\n\"Target One--Zone Ten,\" a quiet voice spoke into Kinnison's ear and one\nof the white specks upon his plate turned yellowish green. The same\nwords, the same lights, were heard and seen by the eleven other Technos\nof Sector A, of which Kinnison, by virtue of standing at the top of his\nCombat Rocket's Proficiency List, was Sector Chief. He knew that the\nvoice was that of Sector A's Fire Control Officer, whose duty it was to\ndetermine, from courses, velocities, and all other data to be had from\nground and lofty observers, the order in which his Sector's targets\nshould be eliminated. And Sector A, an imaginary but sharply-defined\ncone, was in normal maneuvering the hottest part of the sky. Fire\nControl's \"Zone Ten\" had informed him that the object was at extreme\nrange and hence there would be plenty of time. Nevertheless:\n\n\"Lawrence--two! Doyle--one! Drummond--stand by with three!\" he snapped,\nat the first word.\n\nIn the instant of hearing his name each Techno stabbed down a series of\nstuds and there flowed into his ears a rapid stream of figures--the\nup-to-the-second data from every point of observation as to every\nelement of motion of his target. He punched the figures into his\ncalculator, which would correct automatically for the motion of his own\nvessel--glanced once at the printed solution of the problem--tramped\ndown upon a pedal once, twice, or three times, depending upon the\nnumber of projectiles he had been directed to handle.\n\nKinnison had ordered Lawrence, a better shot than Doyle, to launch two\ntorpedoes; neither of which, at such long range, was expected to strike\nits mark. His second, however, should come close; so close that the\ninstantaneous data sent back to both screens--and to Kinnison's--by the\ntorpedo itself would make the target a sitting duck for Doyle, the less\nproficient follower.\n\nDrummond, Kinnison's Number Three, would not launch his missiles unless\nDoyle missed. Nor could both Drummond and Harper, Kinnison's Number Two,\nbe \"out\" at once. One of the two had to be \"in\" at all times, to take\nKinnison's place in charge of the Sector if the Chief were ordered out.\nFor while Kinnison could order either Harper or Drummond on target, he\ncould not send himself. He could go out only when ordered to do so by\nFire Control: Sector Chiefs were reserved for emergency use only.\n\n\"Target Two--Zone Nine,\" Fire Control said.\n\n\"Carney, two. French, one. Day, stand by with three!\" Kinnison ordered.\n\n\"Damn it--missed!\" This from Doyle. \"Buck fever--no end.\"\n\n\"O.K., boy--that's why we're starting so soon. I'm shaking like a\nvibrator myself. We'll get over it....\"\n\nThe point of light which represented Target One bulged slightly and went\nout. Drummond had connected and was back \"in\".\n\n\"Target Three--Zone Eight. Four--eight,\" Fire Control remarked.\n\n\"Target Three--Higgins and Green; Harper stand by. Four--Case and\nSantos: Lawrence.\"\n\nAfter a minute or two of actual combat the Technos of Sector A began to\nsteady down. Stand-by men were no longer required and were no longer\nassigned.\n\n\"Target Forty-one--six,\" said Fire Control; and:\n\n\"Lawrence, two. Doyle, two,\" ordered Kinnison. This was routine enough,\nbut in a moment:\n\n\"Ted!\" Lawrence snapped. \"Missed--wide--both barrels. Forty-one's\ndodging--manned or directed--coming like hell--watch it, Doyle--WATCH\nIT!\"\n\n\"Kinnison, take it!\" Fire Control barked, voice now neither low nor\nsteady, and without waiting to see whether Doyle would hit or miss.\n\"It's in Zone Three already--collision course!\"\n\n\"Harper! Take over!\"\n\nKinnison got the data, solved the equations, launched five torpedoes at\nfifty gravities of acceleration. One ... two--three-four-five; the last\nthree as close together as they could fly without setting off their\nproximity fuzes.\n\nCommunications and mathematics and the electronic brains of calculating\nmachines had done all that they could do; the rest was up to human\nskill, to the perfection of co-ordination and the speed of reaction of\nhuman mind, nerve, and muscle.\n\nKinnison's glance darted from plate to panel to computer-tape to meter\nto galvanometer and back to plate; his left hand moved in tiny arcs the\nknobs whose rotation varied the intensities of two mutually\nperpendicular components of his torpedoes' drives. He listened\nattentively to the reports of triangulating observers, now giving him\ndata covering his own missiles, as well as the target object. The\nfingers of his right hand punched almost constantly the keys of his\ncomputer; he corrected almost constantly his torpedoes' course.\n\n\"Up a hair,\" he decided. \"Left about a point.\"\n\nThe target moved away from its predicted path.\n\nDown two--left three--down a hair--_Right_! The thing was almost through\nZone Two; was blasting into Zone One.\n\nHe thought for a second that his first torp was going to connect. It\nalmost did--only a last-instant, full-powered side thrust enabled the\ntarget to evade it. Two numbers flashed white upon his plate; his actual\nerror, exact to the foot of distance and to the degree on the clock,\nmeasured and transmitted back to his board by instruments in his\ntorpedo.\n\nWorking with instantaneous and exact data, and because the enemy had so\nlittle time in which to act, Kinnison's second projectile made a very\nnear miss indeed. His third was a graze; so close that its proximity\nfuze functioned, detonating the cyclonite-packed war-head. Kinnison knew\nthat his third went off, because the error-figures vanished, almost in\nthe instant of their coming into being, as its detecting and\ntransmitting instruments were destroyed. That one detonation might have\nbeen enough; but Kinnison had had one glimpse of his error--how small it\nwas!--and had a fraction of a second of time. Hence Four and Five\nslammed home; dead center. Whatever that target had been, it was no\nlonger a threat.\n\n\"Kinnison, in,\" he reported briefly to Fire Control, and took over from\nHarper the direction of the activities of Sector A.\n\nThe battle went on. Kinnison sent Harper and Drummond out time after\ntime. He himself was given three more targets. The first wave of the\nenemy--what was left of it--passed. Sector A went into action, again at\nextreme range, upon the second. Its remains, too, plunged downward and\nonward toward the distant ground.\n\nThe third wave was really tough. Not that it was actually any worse than\nthe first two had been, but the CR10685 was no longer getting the data\nwhich her Technos ought to have to do a good job; and every man aboard\nher knew why. Some enemy stuff had got through, of course; and the\nobservatories, both on the ground and above it--the eye of the whole\nAmerican Defense--had suffered heavily.\n\nNevertheless, Kinnison and his fellows were not too perturbed. Such a\ncondition was not entirely unexpected. They were now veterans; they had\nbeen tried and had not been found wanting. They had come unscathed\nthrough a bath of fire the like of which the world had never before\nknown. Give them any kind of computation at all--or no computation at\nall except old CR10685's own radar and their own torps, of which they\nstill had plenty--and they could and would take care of anything that\ncould be thrown at them.\n\nThe third wave passed. Targets became fewer and fewer. Action slowed\ndown ... stopped.\n\nThe Technos, even the Sector Chiefs, knew nothing whatever of the\nprogress of the battle as a whole. They did not know where their rocket\nwas, or whether it was going north, east, south, or west. They knew when\nit was going up or down only by the \"seats of their pants.\" They did not\neven know the nature of the targets they destroyed, since upon their\nplates all targets looked alike--small, bright, greenish-yellow spots.\nHence:\n\n\"Give us the dope, Pete, if we've got a minute to spare,\" Kinnison\nbegged of his Fire Control Officer. \"You know more than we do--give!\"\n\n\"It's coming in now,\" came the prompt reply. \"Six of those targets that\ndid such fancy dodging were atomics, aimed at the Lines. Five were\ndirigibles, with our number on 'em. You fellows did a swell job. Very\nlittle of their stuff got through--not enough, they say, to do much\ndamage to a country as big as the U.S.A. On the other hand, they stopped\nscarcely any of ours--they apparently didn't have anything to compare\nwith you Technos.\n\n\"But all hell seems to be busting loose, all over the world. Our east\nand west coasts are both being attacked, they say; but are holding.\nOperation Daisy and Operation Fairfield are clicking, just like we did.\nEurope, they say, is going to hell--everybody is taking pot-shots at\neverybody else. One report says that the South American nations are\nbombing each other ... Asia, too ... nothing definite; as straight dope\ncomes in I'll relay it to you.\n\n\"We came through in very good shape, considering ... losses less than\nanticipated, only seven percent. The First Line--as you know\nalready--took a God-awful shellacking; in fact, the Churchill-Belcher\nsection was practically wiped out, which was what lost us about all of\nour Observation.... We are now just about over the southern end of\nHudson Bay, heading down and south to join in making a vertical Fleet\nFormation ... no more waves coming, but they say to expect attacks from\nlow-flying combat rockets--there goes the alert! On your toes,\nfellows--but there isn't a thing on Sector A's screen....\"\n\nThere wasn't. Since the CR10685 was diving downward and southward, there\nwouldn't be. Nevertheless, some observer aboard that rocket saw that\natomic missile coming. Some Fire Control Officer yelled orders; some\nTechnos did their best--and failed.\n\nAnd such is the violence of nuclear fission; so utterly incomprehensible\nis its speed, that Theodore K. Kinnison died without realizing that\nanything whatever was happening to his ship or to him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Gharlane of Eddore looked upon ruined Earth, his handiwork, and found\nit good. Knowing that it would be many of hundreds of Tellurian years\nbefore that planet would again require his personal attention, he went\nelsewhere; to Rigel Four, to Palain Seven, and to the solar system of\nVelantia, where he found that his creatures the Overlords were not\nprogressing according to schedule. He spent quite a little time there,\nthen searched minutely and fruitlessly for evidence of inimical activity\nwithin the Innermost Circle._\n\n_And upon far Arisia a momentous decision was made: the time had come to\ncurb sharply the hitherto unhampered Eddorians._\n\n\"_We are ready, then, to war openly upon them?\" Eukonidor asked,\nsomewhat doubtfully. \"Again to cleanse the planet Tellus of dangerous\nradioactives and of too-noxious forms of life is of course a simple\nmatter. From our protected areas in North America a strong but\ndemocratic government can spread to cover the world. That government can\nbe extended easily enough to include Mars and Venus. But Gharlane, who\nis to operate as Roger, who has already planted, in the Adepts of North\nPolar Jupiter, the seeds of the Jovian Wars...._\"\n\n\"_Your visualization is sound, youth. Think on._\"\n\n\"_Those interplanetary wars are of course inevitable, and will serve to\nstrengthen and to unify the government of the Inner Planets ... provided\nthat Gharlane does not interfere.... Oh, I see. Gharlane will not at\nfirst know; since a zone of compulsion will be held upon him. When he or\nsome Eddorian fusion perceives that compulsion and breaks it--at some\nsuch time of high stress as the Nevian incident--it will be too late.\nOur fusions will be operating. Roger will be allowed to perform only\nsuch acts as will be for Civilization's eventual good. Nevia was\nselected as Prime Operator because of its location in a small region of\nthe galaxy which is almost devoid of solid iron and because of its\nwatery nature; its aquatic forms of life being precisely those in which\nthe Eddorians are least interested. They will be given partial\nneutralization of inertia; they will be able to attain velocities a few\ntimes greater than that of light. That covers the situation, I think?_\"\n\n\"_Very good, Eukonidor,\" the Elders approved. \"A concise and accurate\nsummation._\"\n\n_Hundreds of Tellurian years passed. The aftermath.

A solid, unshakeable union._\n\n_Nor did any Eddorian know that such fantastically rapid progress was\nbeing made. Indeed, Gharlane knew, as he drove his immense ship of space\ntoward Sol, that he would find Tellus inhabited by peoples little above\nsavagery._\n\n_And it should be noted in passing that not once, throughout all those\ncenturies, did a man named Kinnison marry a girl with red-bronze-auburn\nhair and gold-flecked, tawny eyes._\n\n\n\n\nBOOK THREE\n\nTRIPLANETARY\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\nPIRATES OF SPACE\n\n\nApparently motionless to her passengers and crew, the Interplanetary\nliner _Hyperion_ bored serenely onward through space at normal\nacceleration. In the railed-off sanctum in one corner of the control\nroom a bell tinkled, a smothered whirr was heard, and Captain Bradley\nfrowned as he studied the brief message upon the tape of the recorder--a\nmessage flashed to his desk from the operator's panel. He beckoned, and\nthe second officer, whose watch it now was, read aloud:\n\n\"Reports of scout patrols still negative.\"\n\n\"Still negative.\" The officer scowled in thought. \"They've already\nsearched beyond the widest possible location of wreckage, too. Two\nunexplained disappearances inside a month--first the _Dione_, then the\n_Rhea_--and not a plate nor a lifeboat recovered. Looks bad, sir. One\nmight be an accident; two might possibly be a coincidence....\" His voice\ndied away.\n\n\"But at three it would get to be a habit,\" the captain finished the\nthought. \"And whatever happened, happened quick. Neither of them had\ntime to say a word--their location recorders simply went dead. But of\ncourse they didn't have our detector screens nor our armament. According\nto the observatories we're in clear ether, but I wouldn't trust them\nfrom Tellus to Luna. You have given the new orders, of course?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Detectors full out, all three courses of defensive screen on\nthe trips, projectors manned, suits on the hooks. Every object detected\nto be investigated immediately--if vessels, they are to be warned to\nstay beyond extreme range. Anything entering the fourth zone is to be\nrayed.\"\n\n\"Right--we are going through!\"\n\n\"But no known type of vessel could have made away with them without\ndetection,\" the second officer argued. \"I wonder if there isn't\nsomething in those wild rumors we've been hearing lately?\"\n\n\"Bah! Of course not!\" snorted the captain. \"Pirates in ships faster than\nlight--sub-ethereal rays--nullification of gravity mass without\ninertia--ridiculous! Proved impossible, over and over again. No, sir, if\npirates are operating in space--and it looks very much like it--they\nwon't get far against a good big battery full of kilowatt-hours behind\nthree courses of heavy screen, and good gunners behind multiplex\nprojectors. They're good enough for anybody. Pirates, Neptunians,\nangels, or devils--in ships or on broomsticks--if they tackle the\n_Hyperion_ we'll burn them out of the ether!\"\n\nLeaving the captain's desk, the watch officer resumed his tour of duty.\nThe six great lookout plates into which the alert observers peered were\nblank, their far-flung ultra-sensitive detector screens encountering no\nobstacle--the ether was empty for thousands upon thousands of\nkilometers. The signal lamps upon the pilot's panel were dark, its\nwarning bells were silent. A brilliant point of white light in the\ncenter of the pilot's closely ruled micrometer grating, exactly upon the\ncross-hairs of his directors, showed that the immense vessel was\nprecisely upon the calculated course, as laid down by the automatic\nintegrating course plotters. Everything was quiet and in order.\n\n\"All's well, sir,\" he reported briefly to Captain Bradley--but all was\nnot well.\n\nDanger--more serious by far in that it was not external--was even then,\nall unsuspected, gnawing at the great ship's vitals. In a locked and\nshielded compartment, deep down in the interior of the liner, was the\ngreat air purifier. Now a man leaned against the primary duct--the aorta\nthrough which flowed the stream of pure air supplying the entire vessel.\nThis man, grotesque in full panoply of space armor, leaned against the\nduct, and as he leaned a drill bit deeper and deeper into the steel wall\nof the pipe. Soon it broke through, and the slight rush of air was stopped\nby the insertion of a tightly fitting rubber tube. The tube terminated in\na heavy rubber balloon, which surrounded a frail glass bulb. The man stood\ntense, one hand holding before his silica-and-steel-helmeted head a large\npocket chronometer, the other lightly grasping the balloon. A sneering\ngrin was upon his face as he waited the exact second of action--the\ncarefully predetermined instant when his right hand, closing, would\nshatter the fragile flask and force its contents into the primary air\nstream of the _Hyperion_!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFar above, in the main saloon, the regular evening dance was in full\nswing. The ship's orchestra crashed into silence, there was a patter of\napplause, and Clio Marsden, radiant belle of the voyage, led her partner\nout onto the promenade and up to one of the observation plates.\n\n\"Oh, we can't see the Earth any more!\" she exclaimed. \"Which way do you\nturn this, Mr. Costigan?\"\n\n\"Like this,\" and Conway Costigan, burly young First Officer of the\nliner, turned the dials. \"There--this plate is looking back, or down, at\nTellus; this other one is looking ahead.\"\n\nEarth was a brilliantly shining crescent far beneath the flying vessel.\nAbove her, ruddy Mars and silvery Jupiter blazed in splendor ineffable\nagainst a background of utterly indescribable blackness--a background\nthickly besprinkled with dimensionless points of dazzling brilliance\nwhich were the stars.\n\n\"Oh, isn't it wonderful!\" breathed the girl, awed. \"Of course, I suppose\nthat it's old stuff to you, but I'm a ground-gripper, you know, and I\ncould look at it forever, I think. That's why I want to come out here\nafter every dance. You know, I....\"\n\nHer voice broke off suddenly, with a queer, rasping catch, as she seized\nhis arm in a frantic clutch and as quickly went limp. He stared at her\nsharply, and understood instantly the message written in her eyes--eyes\nnow enlarged, staring, hard, brilliant, and full of soul-searing terror\nas she slumped down, helpless but for his support. In the act of\nexhaling as he was, lungs almost entirely empty, yet he held his breath\nuntil he had seized the microphone from his belt and had snapped the\nlever to \"emergency.\"\n\n\"Control room!\" he gasped then, and every speaker throughout the great\ncruiser of the void blared out the warning as he forced his already\nevacuated lungs to absolute emptiness. \"Vee-Two Gas! Get tight!\"\n\nWrithing and twisting in his fierce struggle to keep his lungs from\ngulping in a draft of that noxious atmosphere, and with the unconscious\nform of the girl draped limply over his left arm, Costigan leaped toward\nthe portal of the nearest lifeboat. Orchestra instruments crashed to the\nfloor and dancing couples fell and sprawled inertly while the tortured\nFirst Officer swung the door of the lifeboat open and dashed across the\ntiny room to the air-valves. Throwing them wide open, he put his mouth\nto the orifice and let his laboring lungs gasp their eager fill of the\ncold blast roaring from the tanks. Then, air-hunger partially assuaged,\nhe again held his breath, broke open the emergency locker, donned one of\nthe space-suits always kept there, and opened its valves wide in order\nto flush out of his uniform any lingering trace of the lethal gas.\n\nHe then leaped back to his companion. Shutting off the air, he released\na stream of pure oxygen, held her face in it, and made shift to force\nsome of it into her lungs by compressing and releasing her chest against\nhis own body. Soon she drew a spasmodic breath, choking and coughing,\nand he again changed the gaseous stream to one of pure air, speaking\nurgently as she showed signs of returning consciousness.\n\n\"Stand up!\" he snapped. \"Hang onto this brace and keep your face in this\nair-stream until I get a suit around you! Got me?\"\n\nShe nodded weakly, and, assured that she could hold herself at the\nvalve, it was the work of only a minute to encase her in one of the\nprotective coverings. Then, as she sat upon a bench, recovering her\nstrength, he flipped on the lifeboat's visiphone projector and shot its\ninvisible beam up into the control room, where he saw space-armored\nfigures furiously busy at the panels.\n\n\"Dirty work at the cross-roads!\" he blazed to his captain, man to\nman--formality disregarded, as it so often was in the Triplanetary\nservice. \"There's skulduggery afoot somewhere in our primary air! Maybe\nthat's the way they got those other two ships--pirates! Might have been\na timed bomb--don't see how anybody could have stowed away down there\nthrough the inspections, and nobody but Franklin can neutralize the\nshield of the air room--but I'm going to look around, anyway. Then I'll\njoin you fellows up there.\"\n\n\"What was it?\" the shaken girl asked. \"I think that I remember your\nsaying 'Vee-Two gas.' That's forbidden! Anyway, I owe you my life,\nConway, and I'll never forget it--never. Thanks--but the others--how\nabout all the rest of us?\"\n\n\"It was Vee-Two, and it is forbidden,\" Costigan replied grimly, eyes\nfast upon the flashing plate, whose point of projection was now deep in\nthe bowels of the vessel. \"The penalty for using it or having it is\ndeath on sight. Gangsters and pirates use it, since they have nothing to\nlose, being on the death list already. As for your life, I haven't saved\nit yet--you may wish I'd let it ride before we get done. The others are\ntoo far gone for oxygen--couldn't have brought even you around in a few\nmore seconds, quick as I got to you. But there's a sure antidote--we all\ncarry it in a lock-box in our armor--and we all know how to use it,\nbecause crooks all use Vee-Two and so we're always expecting it. But\nsince the air will be pure again in half an hour we'll be able to revive\nthe others easily enough if we can get by with whatever is going to\nhappen next. There's the bird that did it, right in the air-room. It's\nthe Chief Engineer's suit, but that isn't Franklin that's in it. Some\npassenger--disguised--slugged the Chief--took his suit and\nprojectors--hole in duct--p-s-s-t! All washed out! Maybe that's all he\nwas scheduled to do to us in this performance, but he'll do nothing else\nin his life!\"\n\n\"Don't go down there!\" protested the girl. \"His armor is so much better\nthan that emergency suit you are wearing, and he's got Mr. Franklin's\nLewiston, besides!\"\n\n\"Don't be an idiot!\" he snapped. \"We can't have a live pirate\naboard--we're going to be altogether too busy with outsiders directly.\nDon't worry, I'm not going to give him a break. I'll take a\nStandish--I'll rub him out like a blot. Stay right here until I come\nback after you,\" he commanded, and the heavy door of the lifeboat\nclanged shut behind him as he leaped out into the promenade.\n\nStraight across the saloon he made his way, paying no attention to the\ninert forms scattered here and there. Going up to a blank wall, he\nmanipulated an almost invisible dial set flush with its surface, swung a\nheavy door aside, and lifted out the Standish--a fearsome weapon. Squat,\nhuge, and heavy, it resembled somewhat an overgrown machine rifle, but\none possessing a thick, short telescope, with several opaque condensing\nlenses and parabolic reflectors. Laboring under the weight of the thing,\nhe strode along corridors and clambered heavily down short stairways.\nFinally he came to the purifier room, and grinned savagely as he saw the\ngreenish haze of light obscuring the door and walls--the shield was\nstill in place; the pirate was still inside, still flooding with the\nterrible Vee Two the _Hyperion's_ primary air.\n\nHe set his peculiar weapon down, unfolded its three massive legs,\ncrouched down behind it, and threw in a switch. Dull red beams of\nfrightful intensity shot from the reflectors and sparks, almost of\nlightning proportions, leaped from the shielding screen under their\nimpact. Roaring and snapping, the conflict went on for seconds, then,\nunder the superior force of the Standish, the greenish radiance gave\nway. Behind it the metal of the door ran the gamut of color--red,\nyellow, blinding white--then literally exploded; molten, vaporized,\nburned away. Through the aperture thus made Costigan could plainly see\nthe pirate in the space-armor of the chief engineer--an armor which was\nproof against rifle fire and which could reflect and neutralize for some\nlittle time even the terrific beam Costigan was employing. Nor was the\npirate unarmed--a vicious flare of incandescence leaped from his\nLewiston, to spend its force in spitting, crackling pyrotechnics against\nthe ether-wall of the squat and monstrous Standish. But Costigan's\ninfernal engine did not rely only upon vibratory destruction. At almost\nthe first flash of the pirate's weapon the officer touched a trigger,\nthere was a double report, ear-shattering in that narrowly confined\nspace, and the pirate's body literally flew into mist as a half-kilogram\nshell tore through his armor and exploded. Costigan shut off his beam,\nand with not the slightest softening of one hard lineament stared around\nthe air-room; making sure that no serious damage had been done to the\nvital machinery of the air-purifier--the very lungs of the great\nspace-ship.\n\nDismounting the Standish, he lugged it back up to the main saloon,\nreplaced it in its safe, and again set the combination lock. Thence to\nthe lifeboat, where Clio cried out in relief as she saw that he was\nunhurt.\n\n\"Oh, Conway, I've been so afraid something would happen to you!\" she\nexclaimed, as he led her rapidly upward toward the control room. \"Of\ncourse you ...\" she paused.\n\n\"Sure,\" he replied, laconically. \"Nothing to it. How do you feel--about\nback to normal?\"\n\n\"All right, I think, except for being scared to death and just about out\nof control. I don't suppose that I'll be good for anything, but whatever\nI can do, count me in on.\"\n\n\"Fine--you may be needed, at that. Everybody's out, apparently, except\nthose like me, who had a warning and could hold their breath until they\ngot to their suits.\"\n\n\"But how did you know what it was? You can't see it, nor smell it, nor\nanything.\"\n\n\"You inhaled a second before I did, and I saw your eyes. I've been in it\nbefore--and when you see a man get a jolt of that stuff just once, you\nnever forget it. The engineers down below got it first, of course--it\nmust have wiped them out. Then we got it in the saloon. Your passing out\nwarned me, and luckily I had enough breath left to give the word. Quite\na few of the fellows up above should have had time to get away--we'll\nsee 'em all in the control room.\"\n\n\"I suppose that was why you revived me--in payment for so kindly\nwarning you of the gas attack?\" The girl laughed; shaky, but game.\n\n\"Something like that, probably,\" he answered, lightly. \"Here we are--now\nwe'll soon find out what's going to happen next.\"\n\nIn the control room they saw at least a dozen armored figures; not now\nrushing about, but seated at their instruments, tense and ready.\nFortunate it was that Costigan--veteran of space as he was, though young\nin years--had been down in the saloon; fortunate that he had been\nfamiliar with that horrible outlawed gas; fortunate that he had had\npresence of mind enough and sheer physical stamina enough to send his\nwarning without allowing one paralyzing trace to enter his own lungs.\nCaptain Bradley, the men on watch, and several other officers in their\nquarters or in the wardrooms--space-hardened veterans all--had obeyed\ninstantly and without question the amplifiers' gasped command to \"get\ntight\". Exhaling or inhaling, their air-passages had snapped shut as\nthat dread \"Vee-Two\" was heard, and they had literally jumped into their\narmored suits of space--flushing them out with volume after volume of\nunquestionable air; holding their breath to the last possible second,\nuntil their straining lungs could endure no more.\n\nCostigan waved the girl to a vacant bench, cautiously changing into his\nown armor from the emergency suit he had been wearing, and approached\nthe captain.\n\n\"Anything in sight, sir?\" he asked, saluting. \"They should have started\nsomething before this.\"\n\n\"They've started, but we can't locate them. We tried to send out a\ngeneral sector alarm, but had hardly started when they blanketed our\nwave. Look at that!\"\n\nFollowing the captain's eyes, Costigan stared at the high powered set of\nthe ship's operator. Upon the plate, instead of a moving, living,\nthree-dimensional picture, there was a flashing glare of blinding white\nlight; from the speaker, instead of intelligible speech, was issuing a\nroaring, crackling stream of noise.\n\n\"It's impossible!\" Bradley burst out, violently. \"There's not a gram of\nmetal inside the fourth zone--within a hundred thousand kilometers--and\nyet they must be close to send such a wave as that. But the Second\nthinks not--what do you think, Costigan?\" The bluff commander,\nreactionary and of the old school as was his breed, was\nfurious--baffled, raging inwardly to come to grips with the invisible\nand indetectable foe. Face to face with the inexplicable, however, he\nlistened to the younger men with unusual tolerance.\n\n\"It's not only possible; it's quite evident that they've got something\nwe haven't.\" Costigan's voice was bitter. \"But why shouldn't they have?\nService ships never get anything until it's been experimented with for\nyears, but pirates and such always get the new stuff as soon as it's\ndiscovered. The only good thing I can see is that we got part of a\nmessage away, and the scouts can trace that interference out there. But\nthe pirates know that, too--it won't be long now,\" he concluded, grimly.\n\nHe spoke truly. Before another word was said the outer screen flared\nwhite under a beam of terrific power, and simultaneously there appeared\nupon one of the lookout plates a vivid picture of the pirate vessel--a\nhuge, black torpedo of steel, now emitting flaring offensive beams of\nforce.\n\nInstantly the powerful weapons of the _Hyperion_ were brought to bear,\nand in the blast of full-driven beams the stranger's screens flamed\nincandescent. Heavy guns, under the recoil of whose fierce salvos the\nframe of the giant globe trembled and shuddered, shot out their tons of\nhigh-explosive shell. But the pirate commander had known accurately the\nstrength of the liner, and knew that her armament was impotent against\nthe forces at his command. His screens were invulnerable, the giant\nshells were exploded harmlessly in mid-space, miles from their\nobjective. And suddenly a frightful pencil of flame stabbed brilliantly\nfrom the black hulk of the enemy. Through the empty ether it tore,\nthrough the mighty defensive screens, through the tough metal of the\nouter and inner walls. Every ether-defense of the _Hyperion_ vanished,\nand her acceleration dropped to a quarter of its normal value.\n\n\"Right through the battery room!\" Bradley groaned. \"We're on the\nemergency drive now. Our rays are done for, and we can't seem to put a\nshell anywhere near her with our guns!\"\n\nBut ineffective as the guns were, they were silenced forever as a\nfrightful beam of destruction stabbed relentlessly through the control\nroom, whiffing out of existence the pilot, gunnery, and lookout panels\nand the men before them. The air rushed into space, and the suits of the\nthree survivors bulged out into drum-head tightness as the pressure in\nthe room decreased.\n\nCostigan pushed the captain lightly toward a wall, then seized the girl\nand leaped in the same direction.\n\n\"Let's get out of here, quick!\" he cried, the miniature radio\ninstruments of the helmets automatically taking up the duty of\ntransmitting speech as the sound disks refused to function. \"They can't\nsee us--our ether wall is still up and their spy-rays can't get through\nit from the outside, you know. They're working from blue-prints, and\nthey'll probably take your desk next,\" and even as they bounded toward\nthe door, now become the outer seal of an airlock, the pirates' beam\ntore through the space which they had just quitted.\n\nThrough the airlock, down through several levels of passengers' quarters\nthey hurried, and into a lifeboat, whose one doorway commanded the full\nlength of the third lounge--an ideal spot, either for defense or for\nescape outward by means of the miniature cruiser. As they entered their\nretreat they felt their weight begin to increase. More and more force\nwas applied to the helpless liner, until it was moving at normal\nacceleration.\n\n\"What do you make of that, Costigan?\" asked the captain. \"Tractor\nbeams?\"\n\n\"Apparently. They've got something, all right. They're taking us\nsomewhere, fast. I'll go get a couple of Standishes, and another suit of\narmor--we'd better dig in,\" and soon the small room became a veritable\nfortress, housing as it did those two formidable engines of destruction.\nThen the first officer made another and longer trip, returning with a\ncomplete suit of Triplanetary space armor, exactly like those worn by\nthe two men, but considerably smaller.\n\n\"Just as an added factor of safety, you'd better put this on,\nClio--those emergency suits aren't good for much in a battle. I don't\nsuppose that you ever fired a Standish, did you?\"\n\n\"No, but I can soon learn how to do it,\" she replied pluckily.\n\n\"Two is all that can work here at once, but you should know how to take\nhold in case one of us goes out. And while you're changing suits you'd\nbetter put on some stuff I've got here--Service Special phones and\ndetectors. Stick this little disk onto your chest with this bit of tape;\nlow down, out of sight. Just under your wishbone is the best place. Take\noff your wrist-watch and wear this one _continuously_--never take it off\nfor a second. Put on these pearls, and wear them all the time, too. Take\nthis capsule and hide it against your skin, some place where it can't be\nfound except by the most rigid search. Swallow it in an emergency--it\ngoes down easily and works just as well inside as outside. It is the\nmost important thing of all--you can get along with it alone if you lose\neverything else, but without that capsule the whole system's shot to\npieces. With that outfit, if we should get separated, you can talk to\nus--we're both wearing 'em, although in somewhat different forms. You\ndon't need to talk loud--just a mutter will be enough. They're handy\nlittle outfits--almost impossible to find, and capable of a lot of\nthings.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Conway--I'll remember that, too,\" Clio replied, as she turned\ntoward the tiny locker to follow his instructions. \"But won't the scouts\nand patrols be catching us pretty quick? The operator sent a warning.\"\n\n\"Afraid the ether's empty, as far as we're concerned.\"\n\nCaptain Bradley had stood by in silent astonishment during this\nconversation. His eyes had bulged slightly at Costigan's \"we're both\nwearing 'em,\" but he had held his peace and as the girl disappeared a\nlook of dawning comprehension came over his face.\n\n\"Oh, I see, sir,\" he said, respectfully--far more respectfully than he\nhad ever before addressed a mere first officer. \"Meaning that we both\n_will be_ wearing them shortly, I assume. 'Service Specials'--but you\ndidn't specify exactly _what_ Service, did you?\"\n\n\"Now that you mention it, I don't believe that I did,\" Costigan grinned.\n\n\"That explains several things about you--particularly your recognition\nof Vee-Two and your uncanny control and speed of reaction. But aren't\nyou....\"\n\n\"No,\" Costigan interrupted. \"This situation is apt to get altogether too\nserious to overlook any bets. If we get away, I'll take them away from\nher and she'll never know that they aren't routine equipment. As for\nyou, I know that you can and do keep your mouth shut. That's why I'm\nhanging this junk on you--I had a lot of stuff in my kit, but I flashed\nit all with the Standish except what I brought in here for us three.\nWhether you think so or not, we're in a real jam--our chance of getting\naway is mighty close to zero....\"\n\nHe broke off as the girl came back, now to all appearances a small\nTriplanetary officer, and the three settled down to a long and eventless\nwait. Hour after hour they flew through the ether, but finally there was\na lurching swing and an abrupt increase in their acceleration. After a\nshort consultation Captain Bradley turned on the visiray set and, with\nthe beam at its minimum power, peered cautiously downward, in the\ndirection opposite to that in which he knew the pirate vessel must be.\nAll three stared into the plate, seeing only an infinity of emptiness,\nmarked only by the infinitely remote and coldly brilliant stars. While\nthey stared into space a vast area of the heavens was blotted out and\nthey saw, faintly illuminated by a peculiar blue luminescence, a vast\nball--a sphere so large and so close that they seemed to be dropping\ndownward toward it as though it were a world! They came to a\nstop--paused, weightless--a vast door slid smoothly aside--they were\ndrawn _upward_ through an airlock and floated quietly in the air above a\nsmall, but brightly-lighted and orderly city of metallic buildings!\nGently the _Hyperion_ was lowered, to come to rest in the embracing arms\nof a regulation landing cradle.\n\n\"Well, wherever it is, we're here,\" remarked Captain Bradley, grimly,\nand:\n\n\"And now the fireworks start,\" assented Costigan, with a questioning\nglance at the girl.\n\n\"Don't mind me,\" she answered his unspoken question. \"I don't believe in\nsurrendering, either.\"\n\n\"Right,\" and both men squatted down behind the ether-walls of their\nterrific weapons; the girl prone behind them.\n\nThey had not long to wait. A group of human beings--men and to all\nappearances Americans--appeared unarmed in the little lounge. As soon as\nthey were well inside the room, Bradley and Costigan released upon them\nwithout compunction the full power of their frightful projectors. From\nthe reflectors, through the doorway, there tore a concentrated double\nbeam of pure destruction--but that beam did not reach its goal. Yards\nfrom the men it met a screen of impenetrable density. Instantly the\ngunners pressed their triggers and a stream of high-explosive shells\nissued from the roaring weapons. But shells, also, were futile. They\nstruck the shield and vanished--vanished without exploding and without\nleaving a trace to show that they had ever existed.\n\nCostigan sprang to his feet, but before he could launch his intended\nattack a vast tunnel appeared beside him--something had gone through the\nentire width of the liner, cutting effortlessly a smooth cylinder of\nemptiness. Air rushed in to fill the vacuum, and the three visitors felt\nthemselves seized by invisible forces and drawn into the tunnel. Through\nit they floated, up to and over buildings, finally slanting downward\ntoward the door of a great high-towered structure. Doors opened before\nthem and closed behind them, until at last they stood upright in a room\nwhich was evidently the office of a busy executive. They faced a desk\nwhich, in addition to the usual equipment of the business man, carried\nalso a bewilderingly complete switchboard and instrument panel.\n\nSeated impassively at the desk there was a gray man. Not only was he\ndressed entirely in gray, but his heavy hair was gray, his eyes were\ngray, and even his tanned skin seemed to give the impression of grayness\nin disguise. His overwhelming personality radiated an aura of\ngrayness--not the gentle gray of the dove, but the resistless, driving\ngray of the super-dreadnought; the hard, inflexible, brittle gray of the\nfracture of high-carbon steel.\n\n\"Captain Bradley, First Officer Costigan, Miss Marsden,\" the man spoke\nquietly, but crisply. \"I had not intended you two men to live so long.\nThat is a detail, however, which we will pass by for the moment. You may\nremove your suits.\"\n\nNeither officer moved, but both stared back at the speaker,\nunflinchingly.\n\n\"I am not accustomed to repeating instructions,\" the man at the desk\ncontinued; voice still low and level, but instinct with deadly menace.\n\"You may choose between removing those suits and dying in them, here and\nnow.\"\n\nCostigan moved over to Clio and slowly took off her armor. Then, after a\nflashing exchange of glances and a muttered word, the two officers threw\noff their suits simultaneously and fired at the same instant; Bradley\nwith his Lewiston, Costigan with a heavy automatic pistol whose bullets\nwere explosive shells of tremendous power. But the man in gray,\nsurrounded by an impenetrable wall of force, only smiled at the\nfusillade, tolerantly and maddeningly. Costigan leaped fiercely, only to\nbe hurled backward as he struck that unyielding, invisible wall. A\nvicious beam snapped him back into place, the weapons were snatched\naway, and all three captives were held to their former positions.\n\n\"I permitted that, as a demonstration of futility,\" the gray man said,\nhis hard voice becoming harder, \"but I will permit no more foolishness.\nNow I will introduce myself. I am known as Roger. You probably have\nheard nothing of me: very few Tellurians have, or ever will. Whether or\nnot you two live depends solely upon yourselves. Being something of a\nstudent of men, I fear that you will both die shortly. Able and\nresourceful as you have just shown yourselves to be, you could be\nvaluable to me, but you probably will not--in which case you shall, of\ncourse, cease to exist. That, however, in its proper time--you shall be\nof some slight service to me in the process of being eliminated. In your\ncase, Miss Marsden, I find myself undecided between two courses of\naction; each highly desirable, but unfortunately mutually exclusive.\nYour father will be glad to ransom you at an exceedingly high figure,\nbut in spite of that fact I may decide to use you in a research upon\nsex.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" Clio rose magnificently to the occasion. Fear forgotten, her\ncourageous spirit flashed from her clear young eyes and emanated from\nher taut young body, erect in defiance. \"You may think that you can do\nanything with me that you please, but you can't!\"\n\n\"Peculiar--highly perplexing--why should that one stimulus, in the case\nof young females, produce such an entirely disproportionate reaction?\"\nRoger's eyes bored into Clio's; the girl shivered and looked away. \"But\nsex itself, primal and basic, the most widespread concomitant of life in\nthis continuum, is completely illogical and paradoxical. Most\nbaffling--decidedly, this research on sex must go on.\"\n\nRoger pressed a button and a tall, comely woman appeared--a woman of\nindefinite age and of uncertain nationality.\n\n\"Show Miss Marsden to her apartment,\" he directed, and as the two women\nwent out a man came in.\n\n\"The cargo is unloaded, sir,\" the newcomer reported. \"The two men and\nthe five women indicated have been taken to the hospital.\"\n\n\"Very well, dispose of the others in the usual fashion.\" The minion went\nout, and Roger continued, emotionlessly:\n\n\"Collectively, the other passengers may be worth a million or so, but it\nwould not be worthwhile to waste time upon them.\"\n\n\"What are you, anyway?\" blazed Costigan, helpless but enraged beyond\ncaution. \"I have heard of mad scientists who tried to destroy the Earth,\nand of equally mad geniuses who thought themselves Napoleons capable of\nconquering even the Solar System. Whichever you are, you should know\nthat you can't get away with it.\"\n\n\"I am neither. I am, however, a scientist, and I direct many other\nscientists. I am not mad. You have undoubtedly noticed several peculiar\nfeatures of this place?\"\n\n\"Yes, particularly the artificial gravity and those screens. An ordinary\nether-wall is opaque in one direction, and doesn't bar matter--yours are\ntransparent both ways and something more than impenetrable to matter.\nHow do you do it?\"\n\n\"You could not understand them if I explained them to you, and they are\nmerely two of our smaller developments. I do not intend to destroy your\nplanet Earth; I have no desire to rule over masses of futile and\nbrainless men. I have, however, certain ends of my own in view. To\naccomplish my plans I require hundreds of millions in gold and other\nhundreds of millions in uranium, thorium, and radium; all of which I\nshall take from the planets of this Solar System before I leave it. I\nshall take them in spite of the puerile efforts of the fleets of your\nTriplanetary League.\n\n\"This structure was designed by me and built under my direction. It is\nprotected from meteorites by forces of my devising. It is indetectable\nand invisible--ether waves are bent around it without loss or\ndistortion. I am discussing these points at such length so that you may\nrealize exactly your position. As I have intimated, you can be of\nassistance to me if you will.\"\n\n\"Now just what could you offer any _man_ to make him join your outfit?\"\ndemanded Costigan, venomously.\n\n\"Many things,\" Roger's cold tone betrayed no emotion, no recognition of\nCostigan's open and bitter contempt. \"I have under me many men, bound to\nme by many ties. Needs, wants, longings, and desires differ from man to\nman, and I can satisfy practically any of them. Many men take delight in\nthe society of young and beautiful women, but there are other urges\nwhich I have found quite efficient. Greed, thirst for fame, longing for\npower, and so on, including many qualities usually regarded as 'noble.'\nAnd what I promise, I deliver. I demand only loyalty to me, and that\nonly in certain things and for a relatively short period. In all else,\nmy men do as they please. In conclusion, I can use you two conveniently,\nbut I do not need you. Therefore you may choose now between my service\nand--the alternative.\"\n\n\"Exactly what is the alternative?\"\n\n\"We will not go into that. Suffice it to say that it has to do with a\nminor research, which is not progressing satisfactorily. It will result\nin your extinction, and perhaps I should mention that that extinction\nwill not be particularly pleasant.\"\n\n\"I say NO, you....\" Bradley roared. He intended to give an unexpurgated\nclassification, but was rudely interrupted.\n\n\"Hold on a minute!\" snapped Costigan. \"How about Miss Marsden?\"\n\n\"She has nothing to do with this discussion,\" returned Roger, icily. \"I\ndo not bargain--in fact, I believe that I shall keep her for a time. She\nhas it in mind to destroy herself if I do not allow her to be ransomed,\nbut she will find that door closed to her until I permit it to open.\"\n\n\"In that case, I string along with the Chief--take what he started to\nsay about you and run it clear across the board for me!\" barked\nCostigan.\n\n\"Very well. That decision was to be expected from men of your type.\" The\ngray man touched two buttons and two of his creatures entered the room.\n\"Put these men into two separate cells on the second level,\" he ordered.\n\"Search them; all their weapons may not have been in their armor. Seal\nthe doors and mount special guards, tuned to me here.\"\n\nImprisoned they were, and carefully searched; but they bore no arms, and\nnothing had been said concerning communicators. Even if such instruments\ncould be concealed, Roger would detect their use instantly. At least, so\nran his thought. But Roger's men had no inkling of the possibility of\nCostigan's \"Service Special\" phones, detectors, and spy-ray--instruments\nof minute size and of infinitesimal power, but yet instruments which,\nworking as they were below the level of the ether, were effective at\ngreat distances and caused no vibrations in the ether by which their use\ncould be detected. And what could be more innocent than the regulation\npersonal equipment of every officer of space? The heavy goggles, the\nwrist-watch and its supplementary pocket chronometer, the flash-lamp,\nthe automatic lighter, the sender, the money-belt?\n\nAll these items of equipment were examined with due care; but the\ncleverest minds of the Triplanetary Service had designed those\ncommunicators to pass any ordinary search, however careful, and when\nCostigan and Bradley were finally locked into the designated cells they\nstill possessed their ultra-instruments.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\nIN ROGER'S PLANETOID\n\n\nIn the hall Clio glanced around her wildly, seeking even the narrowest\navenue of escape. Before she could act, however, her body was clamped as\nthough in a vise, and she struggled, motionless.\n\n\"It is useless to attempt to escape, or to do anything except what\nRoger wishes,\" the guide informed her somberly, snapping off the\ninstrument in her hand and thus restoring to the thoroughly cowed girl\nher freedom of motion.\n\n\"His lightest wish is law,\" she continued as they walked down a long\ncorridor. \"The sooner you realize that you must do exactly as he\npleases, in all things, the easier your life will be.\"\n\n\"But I wouldn't _want_ to keep on living!\" Clio declared, with a flash\nof spirit. \"And I can _always_ die, you know.\"\n\n\"You will find that you cannot,\" the passionless creature returned,\nmonotonously. \"If you do not yield, you will long and pray for death,\nbut you will not die unless Roger wills it. Look at me: I cannot die.\nHere is your apartment. You will stay here until Roger gives further\norders concerning you.\"\n\nThe living automaton opened a door and stood silent and impassive while\nClio, staring at her in horror, shrank past her and into the sumptuously\nfurnished suite. The door closed soundlessly and utter silence descended\nas a pall. Not an ordinary silence, but the indescribable perfection of\nthe absolute silence, complete absence of all sound. In that silence\nClio stood motionless. Tense and rigid, hopeless, despairing, she stood\nthere in that magnificent room, fighting an almost overwhelming impulse\nto scream. Suddenly she heard the cold voice of Roger, speaking from the\nempty air.\n\n\"You are over-wrought, Miss Marsden. You can be of no use to yourself or\nto me in that condition. I command you to rest; and, to insure that\nrest, you may pull that cord, which will establish about this room an\nether wall: a wall to cut off even this my voice....\"\n\nThe voice ceased as she pulled the cord savagely and threw herself upon\na divan in a torrent of gasping, strangling, but rebellious sobs. Then\nagain came a voice, but not to her ears. Deep within her, pervading\nevery bone and muscle, it made itself felt rather than heard.\n\n\"Clio?\" it asked. \"Don't talk yet....\"\n\n\"Conway!\" she gasped in relief, every fiber of her being thrilled into\nnew hope at the deep, well-remembered voice of Conway Costigan.\n\n\"Keep still!\" he snapped. \"Don't act so happy! He may have a spy-ray on\nyou. He can't hear me, but he may be able to hear you. When he was\ntalking to you you must have noticed a sort of rough, sandpapery feeling\nunder that necklace I gave you? Since he's got an ether-wall around you\nthe beads are dead now. If you feel anything like that under the\nwrist-watch, breathe deeply, twice. If you don't feel anything there,\nit's safe for you to talk, as loud as you please.\"\n\n\"I don't feel anything, Conway!\" she rejoiced. Tears forgotten, she was\nher old, buoyant self again. \"So that wall _is_ real, after all? I only\nabout half believed it.\"\n\n\"Don't trust it too much, because he can cut it off from the outside any\ntime he wants to. Remember what I told you: that necklace will warn you\nof any spy-ray in the ether, and the watch will detect anything below\nthe level of the ether. It's dead now, of course, since our three phones\nare direct-connected; I'm in touch with Bradley, too. Don't be too\nscared; we've got a lot better chance than I thought we had.\"\n\n\"What? You don't mean it!\"\n\n\"Absolutely. I'm beginning to think that maybe we've got something he\ndoesn't know exists--our ultra-wave. Of course I wasn't surprised when\nhis searchers failed to find our instruments, but it never occurred to\nme that I might have a clear field to use them in! I can't quite believe\nit yet, but I haven't been able to find any indication that he can even\ndetect the bands we are using. I'm going to look around over there with\nmy spy-ray ... I'm looking at you now--feel it?\"\n\n\"Yes, the watch feels that way, now.\"\n\n\"Fine! Not a sign of interference over here, either. I can't find a\ntrace of ultra-wave--anything below ether-level, you know--anywhere in\nthe whole place. He's got so much stuff that we've never heard of that I\nsupposed of course he'd have ultra-wave, too; but if he hasn't, that\ngives us the edge. Well, Bradley and I've got a lot of work to do....\nWait a minute, I just had a thought. I'll be back in about a second.\"\n\nThere was a brief pause, then the soundless, but clear voice went on:\n\n\"Good hunting! That woman that gave you the blue willies isn't\nalive--she's full of the prettiest machinery and circuits you ever saw!\"\n\n\"Oh, Conway!\" and the girl's voice broke in an engulfing wave of\nthanksgiving and relief. \"It was so unutterably horrible, thinking of\nwhat must have happened to her and to others like her!\"\n\n\"He's running a colossal bluff, I think. He's good, all right, but he\nlacks quite a lot of being omnipotent. But don't get too cocky, either.\nPlenty has happened to plenty of women here, and men too--and plenty may\nhappen to us unless we put out a few jets. Keep a stiff upper lip, and\nif you want us, yell. 'Bye!\"\n\nThe silent voice ceased, the watch upon Clio's wrist again became an\nunobtrusive timepiece, and Costigan, in his solitary cell far below her\ntower room, turned his peculiarly goggled eyes toward other scenes. His\nhands, apparently idle in his pockets, manipulated tiny controls; his\nkeen, highly-trained eyes studied every concealed detail of mechanism of\nthe great globe. Finally, he took off the goggles and spoke in a low\nvoice to Bradley, confined in another windowless room across the hall.\n\n\"I think I've got dope enough, Captain. I've found out where he put our\narmor and guns, and I've located all the main leads, controls, and\ngenerators. There are no ether-walls around us here, but every door is\nshielded, and there are guards outside our doors--one to each of us.\nThey're robots, not men. That makes it harder, since they're undoubtedly\nconnected direct to Roger's desk and will give an alarm at the first\nhint of abnormal performance. We can't do a thing until he leaves his\ndesk. See that black panel, a little below the cord-switch to the right\nof your door? That's the conduit cover. When I give you the word, tear\nthat off and you'll see one red wire in the cable. It feeds the\nshield-generator of your door. Break that wire and join me out in the\nhall. Sorry I had only one of these ultra-wave spies, but once we're\ntogether it won't be so bad. Here's what I thought we could do,\" and he\nwent over in detail the only course of action which his survey had shown\nto be possible.\n\n\"There, he's left his desk!\" Costigan exclaimed after the conversation\nhad continued for almost an hour. \"Now as soon as we find out where he's\ngoing, we'll start something ... he's going to see Clio, the swine! This\nchanges things, Bradley!\" His hard voice was a curse.\n\n\"Somewhat!\" blazed the captain. \"I know how you two have been getting on\nall during the cruise. I'm with you, but what can we do?\"\n\n\"We'll do something,\" Costigan declared grimly. \"If he makes a pass at\nher I'll get him if I have to blow this whole sphere out of space, with\nus in it!\"\n\n\"Don't do that, Conway,\" Clio's low voice, trembling but determined, was\nfelt by both men. \"If there's a chance for you to get away and do\nanything about fighting him, don't mind me. Maybe he only wants to talk\nabout the ransom, anyway.\"\n\n\"He wouldn't talk ransom to _you_--he's going to talk something else\nentirely,\" Costigan gritted, then his voice changed suddenly. \"But say,\nmaybe it's just as well this way. They didn't find our specials when\nthey searched us, you know, and we're going to do plenty of damage right\nsoon now. Roger probably isn't a fast worker--more the cat-and-mouse\ntype, I'd say--and after we get started he'll have something on his mind\nbesides you. Think you can stall him off and keep him interested for\nabout fifteen minutes?\"\n\n\"I'm sure I can--I'll do _anything_ to help us, or you, get away from\nthis horrible....\" Her voice ceased as Roger broke the ether-wall of her\napartment and walked toward the divan, upon which she crouched in\nwide-eyed, helpless, trembling terror.\n\n\"Get ready, Bradley!\" Costigan directed tersely. \"He left Clio's\nether-wall off, so that any abnormal signals would be relayed to him\nfrom his desk--he knows that there's no chance of anyone disturbing him\nin that room. But I'm holding a beam on that switch, so that the wall is\non, full strength. No matter what we do now, he can't get a warning.\nI'll have to hold the beam exactly in place, though, so you'll have to\ndo the dirty work. Tear out that red wire and kill those two guards. You\nknow how to kill a robot, don't you?\"\n\n\"Yes--break his eye-lenses and his ear-drums and he'll stop whatever\nhe's doing and send out distress calls.... Got 'em both. Now what?\"\n\n\"Open my door--the shield switch is to the right.\"\n\nCostigan's door flew open and the Triplanetary captain leaped into the\nroom.\n\n\"Now for our armor!\" he cried.\n\n\"Not yet!\" snapped Costigan. He was standing rigid, goggled eyes staring\nimmovably at a spot on the ceiling. \"I can't move a millimeter until\nyou've closed Clio's ether-wall switch. If I take this ray off it for a\nsecond we're sunk. Five floors up, straight ahead down a\ncorridor--fourth door on right. When you're at the switch you'll feel my\nray on your watch. Snap it up!\"\n\n\"Right,\" and the captain leaped away at a pace to be equalled by few men\nof half his years.\n\nSoon he was back, and after Costigan had tested the ether-wall of the\n\"bridal suite\" to make sure that no warning signal from his desk or his\nservants could reach Roger within it, the two officers hurried away\ntoward the room in which their space-armor was.\n\n\"Too bad they don't wear uniforms,\" panted Bradley, short of breath\nfrom the many flights of stairs. \"Might have helped some as disguise.\"\n\n\"I doubt it--with so many robots around, they've probably got signals\nthat we couldn't understand anyway. If we meet anybody it'll mean a\nbattle. Hold it!\" Peering through walls with his spy-ray, Costigan had\nseen two men approaching, blocking an intersecting corridor into which\nthey must turn. \"Two of 'em, a man and a robot--the robot's on your\nside. We'll wait here, right at the corner--when they round it take\n'em!\" and Costigan put away his goggles in readiness for strife.\n\nAll unsuspecting, the two pirates came into view, and as they appeared\nthe two officers struck. Costigan, on the inside, drove a short, hard\nright low into the human pirate's abdomen. The fiercely-driven fist sank\nto the wrist into the soft tissues and the stricken man collapsed. But\neven as the blow landed Costigan had seen that there was a third enemy,\nfollowing close behind the two he had been watching, a pirate who was\neven then training a ray projector upon him. Reacting automatically,\nCostigan swung his unconscious opponent around in front of him, so that\nit was into an enemy's body that the vicious ray tore, and not into his\nown. Crouching down into the smallest possible compass, he straightened\nout with the lashing force of a mighty steel spring, hurling the corpse\nstraight at the flaming mouth of the projector. The weapon crashed to\nthe floor and dead pirate and living went down in a heap. Upon that heap\nCostigan hurled himself, feeling for the pirate's throat. But the fellow\nhad wriggled clear, and countered with a gouging thrust that would have\ntorn out the eyes of a slower man, following it up instantly with a\nsavage kick for the groin. No automaton this, geared and set to perform\ncertain fixed duties with mechanical precision, but a lithe, strong man\nin hard training, fighting with every foul trick known to his murderous\nilk.\n\nBut Costigan was no tyro in the art of dirty fighting. Few indeed were\nthe maiming tricks of foul combat unknown to even the rank and file of\nthe highly efficient under-cover branch of the Triplanetary Service; and\nCostigan, a Sector Chief, knew them all. Not for pleasure,\nsportsmanship, nor million-dollar purses did those secret agents use\nNature's weapons. They came to grips only when it could not possibly be\navoided, but when they were forced to fight in that fashion they went in\nwith but one grim purpose--to kill, and to kill in the shortest possible\nspace of time. Thus it was that Costigan's opening soon came. The\npirate launched a vicious _coup de sabot_, which Costigan avoided by a\nlightning shift. It was a slight shift, barely enough to make the kicker\nmiss, and two powerful hands closed upon that flying foot in midair like\nthe sprung jaws of a bear-trap. Closed and twisted viciously, in the\nsame fleeting instant. There was a shriek, smothered as a heavy boot\ncrashed to its carefully predetermined mark--the pirate was out,\ndefinitely and permanently.\n\nThe struggle had lasted scarcely ten seconds, coming to its close just\nas Bradley finished blinding and deafening the robot. Costigan picked up\nthe projector, again donned his spy-ray goggles, and the two hurried on.\n\n\"Nice work, Chief--it must be a gift to rough-house the way you do,\"\nBradley exclaimed. \"That's why you took the live one?\"\n\n\"Practice helps some, too--I've been in brawls before, and I'm a lot\nyounger and maybe a bit faster than you are,\" Costigan explained\nbriefly, penetrant gaze rigidly to the fore as they ran along one\ncorridor after another.\n\nSeveral more guards, both living and mechanical, were encountered on the\nway, but they were not permitted to offer any opposition. Costigan saw\nthem first. In the furious beam of the projector of the dead pirate they\nwere riven into nothingness, and the two officers sped on to the room\nwhich Costigan had located from afar. The three suits of Triplanetary\nspace armor had been locked up in a cabinet; a cabinet whose doors\nCostigan literally blew off with a blast of force rather than consume\ntime in tracing the power leads.\n\n\"I feel like something now!\" Costigan, once more encased in his own\narmor, heaved a great sigh of relief. \"Rough-and-tumble's all right with\none or two, but that generator room is full of grief, and we won't have\nany too much stuff as it is. We've got to take Clio's suit along--we'll\ncarry it down to the door of the power room, drop it there, and pick it\nup on the way back.\"\n\nContemptuous now of possible guards, the armored pair strode toward the\npower plant--the very heart of the immense fortress of space. Guards\nwere encountered, and captains--officers who signaled frantically to\ntheir chief, since he alone could unleash the frightful forces at his\ncommand, and who profanely wondered at his unwonted silence--but the\nenemy beams were impotent against the ether walls of that armor; and the\npirates, without armor in the security of their own planetoid as they\nwere, vanished utterly in the ravening beams of the twin Lewistons. As\nthey paused before the door of the power room, both men felt Clio's\nvoice raised in her first and last appeal, an appeal wrung from her\nagainst her will by the extremity of her position.\n\n\"Conway! Hurry! His eyes--they're tearing me apart! Hurry, dear!\" In the\nhorror-filled tones both men read clearly--however inaccurately--the\ngirl's dire extremity. Each saw plainly a happy, carefree young\nEarth-girl, upon her first trip into space, locked inside an ether-wall\nwith an over-brained, under-conscienced human machine--a\nsuper-intelligent, but lecherous and unmoral mechanism of flesh and\nblood, acknowledging no authority, ruled by nothing save his own\nscientific drivings and the almost equally powerful urges of his desires\nand passions! She must have fought with every resource at her command.\nShe must have wept and pleaded, stormed and raged, feigned submission\nand played for time--and her torment had not touched in the slightest\ndegree the merciless and gloating brain of the being who called himself\nRoger. Now his tantalizing, ruthless cat-play would be done, the\nhorrible gray-brown face would be close to hers--she wailed her final\ndespairing message to Costigan and attacked that hideous face with the\nfury of a tigress.\n\nCostigan bit off a bitter imprecation. \"Hold him just a second longer,\nsweetheart!\" he cried, and the power room door vanished.\n\nThrough the great room the two Lewistons swept at full aperture and at\nmaximum power, two rapidly-opening fans of death and destruction. Here\nand there a guard, more rapid than his fellows, trained a futile\nprojector--a projector whose magazine exploded at the touch of that\nfrightful field of force, liberating instantaneously its thousands upon\nthousands of kilowatt-hours of-stored-up energy. Through the delicately\nadjusted, complex mechanisms the destroying beams tore. At their touch\narmatures burned out, high-tension leads volatilized in crashing,\nhigh-voltage arcs, masses of metal smoked and burned in the path of vast\nforces now seeking the easiest path to neutralization, delicate\ninstruments blew up, copper ran in streams. As the last machine subsided\ninto a semi-molten mass of metal the two wreckers, each grasping a\nbrace, felt themselves become weightless and knew that they had\naccomplished the first part of their program.\n\nCostigan leaped for the outer door. His the task to go to Clio's\naid--Bradley would follow more slowly, bringing the girl's armor and\ntaking care of any possible pursuit. As he sailed through the air he\nspoke.\n\n\"Coming, Clio! All right, girl?\" Questioningly, half fearfully.\n\n\"All right, Conway.\" Her voice was almost unrecognizable, broken in\nretching agony. \"When everything went crazy he ... found out that the\nether-wall was up and ... forgot all about me. He shut it off ... and\nseemed to go crazy too ... he is floundering around like a wild man now\n... I'm trying to keep ... him from ... going downstairs.\"\n\n\"Good girl--keep him busy one minute more--he's getting all the warnings\nat once and wants to get back to his board. But what's the matter with\nyou? Did he ... hurt you, after all?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, not that--he didn't do anything but look at me--but that was\nbad enough--but I'm sick--horribly sick. I'm falling ... I'm so dizzy\nthat I can scarcely see ... my head is breaking up into little pieces\n... I just _know_ I'm going to die, Conway! Oh ... oh!\"\n\n\"Oh, is _that_ all!\" In his sheer relief that they had been in time,\nCostigan did not think of sympathizing with Clio's very real present\ndistress of mind and body. \"I forgot that you're a ground-gripper--that's\njust a little touch of space-sickness. It'll wear off directly.... All\nright, I'm coming! Let go of him and get as far away from him as you can!\"\n\nHe was now in the street. Perhaps two hundred feet distant and a hundred\nfeet above him was the tower room in which were Clio and Roger. He\nsprang directly toward its large window, and as he floated \"upward\" he\ncorrected his course and accelerated his pace by firing backward at\nvarious angles with his heavy service pistol, uncaring that at the point\nof impact of each of those shells a small blast of destruction erupted.\nHe missed the window a trifle, but that did not matter--his flaming\nLewiston opened a way for him, partly through the window, partly through\nthe wall. As he soared through the opening he trained projector and\npistol upon Roger, now almost to the door, noticing as he did so that\nClio was clinging convulsively to a lamp-bracket upon the wall. Door and\nwall vanished in the Lewiston's terrific beam, but the pirate stood\nunharmed. Neither ravening ray nor explosive shell could harm him--he\nhad snapped on the protective shield whose generator was always upon his\nperson.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Clio reported that Roger seemed to go crazy and was floundering\naround like a wild man, she had no idea of how she was understanding\nthe actual situation; for Gharlane of Eddore, then energizing the form\nof flesh that was Roger, had for the first time in his prodigiously long\nlife met in direct conflict with an overwhelming superior force.\n\nRoger had been sublimely confident that he could detect the use,\nanywhere in or around his planetoid, of ultra-wave. He had been equally\nsure that he could control directly and absolutely the physical\nactivities of any number of these semi-intelligent \"human beings\".\n\nBut four Arisians in fusion--Drounli, Brolenteen, Nedanillor, and\nKriedigan--had been on guard for weeks. When the time came to act, they\nacted.\n\nRoger's first thought, upon discovering what tremendous and inexplicable\ndamage had already been done, was to destroy instantly the two men who\nwere doing it. He could not touch them. His second was to blast out of\nexistence this supposedly human female, but no more could he touch her.\nHis fiercest mental bolts spent themselves harmlessly three millimeters\naway from her skin; she gazed into his eyes completely unaware of the\ntorrents of energy pouring from them. He could not even aim a weapon at\nher! His third was to call for help to Eddore. He could not. The\nsub-ether was closed; nor could he either discover the manner of its\nclosing or trace the power which was keeping it closed!\n\nHis Eddorian body, even if he could recreate it here, could not\nwithstand the environment--this Roger-thing would have to do whatever it\ncould, unaided by Gharlane's mental powers. And, physically, it was a\nvery capable body indeed. Also, it was armed and armored with mechanisms\nof Gharlane's own devising; and Eddore's second-in-command was in no\nsense a coward.\n\nBut Roger, while not exactly a ground-gripper, did not know how to\nhandle himself without weight; whereas Costigan, given six walls against\nwhich to push, was even more efficient in weightless combat than when\nhandicapped by the force of gravitation. Keeping his projector upon the\npirate, he seized the first club to hand--a long, slender pedestal of\nmetal--launched himself past the pirate chief. With all the momentum of\nhis mass and velocity and all the power of his good right arm he swung\nthe bar at the pirate's head. That fiercely-driven mass of metal should\nhave taken head from shoulders, but it did not. Roger's shield of force\nwas utterly rigid and impenetrable; the only effect of the frightful\nblow was to set him spinning, end over end, like the flying baton of an\nacrobatic drum-major. As the spinning form crashed against the opposite\nwall of the room Bradley floated in, carrying Clio's armor. Without a\nword the captain loosened the helpless girl's grip upon the bracket and\nencased her in the suit. Then, supporting her at the window, he held his\nLewiston upon the captive's head while Costigan propelled him toward the\nopening. Both men knew that Roger's shield of force must be threatened\nevery instant--that if he were allowed to release it he probably would\nbring to bear a hand-weapon even superior to their own.\n\nBraced against the wall, Costigan sighted along Roger's body toward the\nmost distant point of the lofty dome of the artificial planet and gave\nhim a gentle push. Then, each grasping Clio by an arm, the two officers\nshoved mightily with their feet and the three armored forms darted away\ntoward their only hope of escape--an emergency boat which could be\nlaunched through the shell of the great globe. To attempt to reach the\n_Hyperion_ and to escape in one of her lifeboats would have been\nuseless; they could not have forced the great gates of the main airlocks\nand no other exits existed. As they sailed onward through the air,\nCostigan keeping the slowly-floating form of Roger enveloped in his\nbeam, Clio began to recover.\n\n\"Suppose they get their gravity fixed?\" she asked, apprehensively. \"And\nthey're raying us and shooting at us!\"\n\n\"They may have it fixed already. They undoubtedly have spare parts and\nduplicate generators, but if they turn it on the fall will kill Roger\ntoo, and he wouldn't like that. They'll have to get him down with a\nhelicopter or something, and they know that we'll get them as fast as\nthey come up. They can't hurt us with hand-weapons, and before they can\nbring up any heavy stuff they'll be afraid to use it, because well be\ntoo close to their shell.\n\n\"I wish we could have brought Roger along,\" he continued, savagely, to\nBradley. \"But you were right, of course--it'd be altogether too much\nlike a rabbit capturing a wildcat. My Lewiston's about done right now,\nand there can't be much left of yours--what he'd do to us would be a sin\nand a shame.\"\n\nNow at the great wall, the two men heaved mightily upon a lever, the\ngate of the emergency port swung slowly open, and they entered the\nminiature cruiser of the void. Costigan, familiar with the mechanism of\nthe craft from careful study from his prison cell, manipulated the\ncontrols. Through gate after massive gate they went, until finally they\nwere out in open space, shooting toward distant Tellus at the maximum\nacceleration of which their small craft was capable.\n\nCostigan cut the other two phones out of circuit and spoke, his\nattention fixed upon some extremely distant point.\n\n\"Samms!\" he called sharply. \"Costigan. We're out ... all right ... yes\n... sure ... absolutely ... you tell 'em, Sammy, I've got company here.\"\n\nThrough the sound-disks of their helmets the girl and the captain had\nheard Costigan's share of the conversation. Bradley stared at his\nerstwhile first officer in amazement, and even Clio had often heard that\nmighty, half-mythical name. Surely that bewildering young man must rank\nhigh, to speak so familiarly to Virgil Samms, the all-powerful head of\nthe space-pervading Service of the Triplanetary League!\n\n\"You've turned in a general call-out,\" Bradley stated, rather than\nasked.\n\n\"Long ago--I've been in touch right along,\" Costigan answered. \"Now that\nthey know what to look for and know that ether-wave detectors are\nuseless, they can find it. Every vessel in seven sectors, clear down to\nthe scout patrols, is concentrating on this point, and the call is out\nfor all battleships and cruisers afloat. There are enough operatives out\nthere with ultra-waves to locate that globe, and once they spot it\nthey'll point it out to all the other vessels.\"\n\n\"But how about the other prisoners?\" asked the girl. \"They'll be killed,\nwon't they?\"\n\n\"Hard telling,\" Costigan shrugged. \"Depends on how things turn out. We\nlack a lot of being safe ourselves yet.\"\n\n\"What's worrying me mostly is our own chance,\" Bradley assented. \"They\nwill chase us, of course.\"\n\n\"Sure, and they'll have more speed than we have. Depends on how far away\nthe nearest Triplanetary vessels are. But we've done everything we can\ndo, for now.\"\n\nSilence fell, and Costigan cut in Clio's phone and came over to the seat\nupon which she was reclining, white and stricken--worn out by the\nhorrible and terrifying ordeals of the last few hours. As he seated\nhimself beside her she blushed vividly, but her deep blue eyes met his\ngray ones steadily.\n\n\"Clio, I ... we ... you ... that is,\" he flushed hotly and stopped. This\nsecret agent, whose clear, keen brain no physical danger could cloud;\nwho had proved over and over again that he was never at a loss in any\nemergency, however desperate--this quick-witted officer floundered in\nembarrassment like any schoolboy; but continued, doggedly: \"I'm afraid\nthat I gave myself away back there, but....\"\n\n\"We gave ourselves away, you mean,\" she filled in the pause. \"I did my\nshare, but I won't hold you to it if you don't want--but I _know_ that\nyou love me, Conway!\"\n\n\"_Love_ you!\" the man groaned, his face lined and hard, his whole body\nrigid. \"That doesn't half tell it, Clio. You don't need to hold me--I'm\nheld for life. There never was a woman who meant anything to me before,\nand there never will be another. You're the only woman that ever\nexisted. It isn't that. Can't you see that it's impossible?\"\n\n\"Of course I can't--it isn't impossible, at all.\" She released her\nshields, four hands met and tightly clasped, and her low voice thrilled\nwith feeling as she went on: \"You love me and I love you. That is all\nthat matters.\"\n\n\"I wish it were,\" Costigan returned bitterly, \"but you don't know what\nyou'd be letting yourself in for. It's who and what you are and who and\nwhat I am that's griping me. You, Clio Marsden, Curtis Marsden's\ndaughter. Nineteen years old. You think you've been places and done\nthings. You haven't. You haven't seen or done anything--you don't know\nwhat it's all about. And whom am I to love a girl like you? A homeless\nspacehound who hasn't been on any planet three weeks in three years. A\nhard-boiled egg. A trouble-shooter and a brawler by instinct and\ntraining. A sp ...\" he bit off the word and went on quickly: \"Why, you\ndon't know me at all, and there's a lot of me that you never _will_\nknow--that I can't let you know! You'd better lay off me, girl, while\nyou can. It'll be best for you, believe me.\"\n\n\"But I can't, Conway, and neither can you,\" the girl answered softly, a\nglorious light in her eyes. \"It's too late for that. On the ship it was\njust another of those things, but since then we've come really to know\neach other, and we're sunk. The situation is out of control, and we both\nknow it--and neither of us would change it if we could, and you know\nthat, too. I don't know very much, I admit, but I do know what you\nthought you'd have to keep from me, and I admire you all the more for\nit. We all honor the Service, Conway dearest--it is only you men who\nhave made and are keeping the Three Planets fit places to live in--and I\nknow that any one of Virgil Samms' assistants would have to be a man in\na thousand million....\"\n\n\"What makes you think that?\" he demanded sharply.\n\n\"You told me so yourself, indirectly. Who else in the three worlds could\npossibly call him 'Sammy?' You are hard, of course, but you must be\nso--and I never did like soft men, anyway. And you brawl in a good\ncause. You are very much a _man_, my Conway; a real, _real_ man, and I\nlove you! Now, if they catch us, all right--we'll die together, at\nleast!\" she finished, intensely.\n\n\"You're right, sweetheart, of course,\" he admitted. \"I don't believe\nthat I _could_ really let you let me go, even though I know you ought\nto,\" and their hands locked together even more firmly than before. \"If\nwe ever get out of this jam I'm going to kiss you, but this is no time\nto be taking off your helmet. In fact, I'm taking too many chances with\nyou in keeping your shields off. Snap 'em on again--they ought to be\ngetting fairly close by this time.\"\n\nHands released and armor again tight, Costigan went over to join Bradley\nat the control board.\n\n\"How are they coming, Captain?\" he asked.\n\n\"Not so good. Quite a ways off yet. At least an hour, I'd say, before a\ncruiser can get within range.\"\n\n\"I'll see if I can locate any of the pirates chasing us. If I do it'll\nbe by accident; this little spy-ray isn't good for much except close\nwork. I'm afraid the first warning we'll have will be when they take\nhold of us with a tractor or spear us with a needle. Probably a beam,\nthough; this is one of their emergency lifeboats and they wouldn't want\nto destroy it unless they have to. Also, I imagine that Roger wants us\nalive pretty badly. He has unfinished business with all three of us, and\nI can well believe that his 'not particularly pleasant extinction' will\nbe even less so after the way we rooked him.\"\n\n\"I want you to do me a favor, Conway.\" Clio's face was white with horror\nat the thought of facing again that unspeakable creature of gray. \"Give\nme a gun or something, please. I don't want him ever to look at me that\nway again, to say nothing of what else he might do, while I'm alive.\"\n\n\"He won't,\" Costigan assured her, narrow of eye and grim of jaw. He was,\nas she had said, hard. \"But you don't want a gun. You might get nervous\nand use it too soon. I'll take care of you at the last possible moment,\nbecause if he gets hold of us we won't stand a chance of getting away\nagain.\"\n\nFor minutes there was silence, Costigan surveying the ether in all\ndirections with his ultra-wave device. Suddenly he laughed, and the\nothers stared at him in surprise.\n\n\"No, I'm not crazy,\" he told them. \"This is really funny; it had never\noccurred to me that the ether-walls of all these ships make them\ninvisible. I can see them, of course, with this sub-ether spy, but they\ncan't see us! I knew that they should have overtaken us before this.\nI've finally found them. They've passed us, and are now tacking around,\nwaiting for us to do something so that they can see us! They're heading\nright into the Fleet--they think they're safe, of course, but what a\nsurprise they've got coming to them!\"\n\nBut it was not only the pirates who were to be surprised. Long before\nthe pirate ship had come within extreme visibility range of the\nTriplanetary Fleet it lost its invisibility and was starkly outlined\nupon the lookout plates of the three fugitives. For a few seconds the\npirate craft seemed unchanged, then it began to glow redly, with a red\nthat seemed to become darker as it grew stronger. Then the sharp\noutlines blurred, puffs of air burst outward, and the metal of the hull\nbecame a viscous, fluid-like something, flowing away in a long, red\nstreamer into seemingly empty space. Costigan turned his ultra-gaze into\nthat space and saw that it was actually far from empty. There lay a vast\nsomething, formless and indefinite even to his sub-etheral vision; a\nsomething into which the viscid stream of transformed metal plunged.\nPlunged and vanished.\n\nPowerful interference blanketed his ultra-wave and howled throughout his\nbody; but in the hope that some parts of his message might get through\nhe called Samms, and calmly and clearly he narrated everything that had\njust happened. He continued his crisp report, neglecting not the\nsmallest detail, while their tiny craft was drawn inexorably toward a\nredly impermeable veil; continued it until their lifeboat, still intact,\nshot through that veil and he found himself unable to move. He was\nconscious, he was breathing normally, his heart was beating; but not a\nvoluntary muscle would obey his will!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9\n\nFLEET AGAINST PLANETOID\n\n\nOne of the newest and fleetest of the patrol vessels of the Triplanetary\nLeague, the heavy cruiser _Chicago_ of the North American Division of\nthe Tellurian Contingent, plunged stolidly through interplanetary\nvacuum. For five long weeks she had patrolled her allotted volume of\nspace. In another week she would report back to the city whose name she\nbore, where her space-weary crew, worn by their long \"tour\" in the\nawesomely oppressive depths of the limitless void, would enjoy to the\nfull their fortnight of refreshing planetary leave.\n\nShe was performing certain routine tasks--charting meteorites, watching\nfor derelicts and other obstructions to navigation, checking in\nconstantly with all scheduled space-ships in case of need, and so\non--but primarily she was a warship. She was a mighty engine of\ndestruction, hunting for the unauthorized vessels of whatever power or\nplanet it was that had not only defied the Triplanetary League, but was\nevidently attempting to overthrow it; attempting to plunge the Three\nPlanets back into the ghastly sink of bloodshed and destruction from\nwhich they had so recently emerged. Every space-ship within range of her\npowerful detectors was represented by two brilliant, slowly-moving\npoints of light; one upon a greater micrometer screen, the other in the\n\"tank,\" the immense, three-dimensional, minutely cubed model of the\nentire Solar System.\n\nA brilliantly intense red light flared upon a panel and a bell clanged\nbrazenly the furious signals of the sector alarm. Simultaneously a\nspeaker roared forth its message of a ship in dire peril.\n\n\"Sector alarm! N.A.T. _Hyperion_ gassed with Vee-Two. Nothing detectable\nin space, but....\"\n\nThe half-uttered message was drowned out in a crackling roar of\nmeaningless noise, the orderly signals of the bell became a hideous\nclamor, and the two points of light which had marked the location of the\nliner disappeared in widely spreading flashes of the same high-powered\ninterference. Observers, navigators, and control officers were alike\ndumbfounded. Even the captain, in the shell-proof, shock-proof, and\ndoubly ray-proof retreat of his conning compartment, was equally at a\nloss. No ship or thing could _possibly_ be close enough to be sending\nout interfering waves of such tremendous power--yet there they were!\n\n\"Maximum acceleration, straight for the point where the _Hyperion_ was\nwhen her tracers went out,\" the captain ordered, and through the fringe\nof that widespread interference he drove a solid beam, reporting\nconcisely to GHQ. Almost instantly the emergency call-out came roaring\nin--every vessel of the Sector, of whatever class or tonnage, was to\nconcentrate upon the point in space where the ill-fated liner had last\nbeen known to be.\n\nHour after hour the great globe drove on at maximum acceleration,\ncaptain and every control officer alert and at high tension. But in\nQuartermasters' Department, deep down below the generator rooms, no\nthought was given to such minor matters as the disappearance of a\n_Hyperion_. The inventory did not balance, and two Q.M. privates were\ntrying, profanely and without success, to find the discrepancy.\n\n\"Charged calls for Mark Twelve Lewistons, none requisitioned, on hand\neighteen thous....\" The droning voice broke off short in the middle of a\nword and the private stood rigid, in the act of reaching for another\nslip, every faculty concentrated upon something imperceptible to his\ncompanion.\n\n\"Come on, Cleve--snap it up!\" the second commanded, but was silenced by\na vicious wave of the listener's hand.\n\n\"What!\" the rigid one exclaimed. \"Reveal ourselves! Why, it's.... Oh,\nall right.... Oh, that's it ... uh-huh ... I see ... yes, I've got it\nsolid. So long!\"\n\nThe inventory sheets fell unheeded from his hand, and his fellow private\nstared after him in amazement as he strode over to the desk of the\nofficer in charge. That officer also stared as the hitherto easy-going\nand gold-bricking Cleve saluted crisply, showed him something flat in\nthe palm of his left hand, and spoke.\n\n\"I've just got some of the funniest orders ever put out, lieutenant, but\nthey came from 'way, 'way up. I'm to join the brass hats in the Center.\nYou'll know all about it directly, I imagine. Cover me up as much as you\ncan, will you?\" and he was gone.\n\nUnchallenged he made his way to the control room, and his curt \"urgent\nreport for the Captain\" admitted him there without question. But when he\napproached the sacred precincts of the captain's own and inviolate room,\nhe was stopped in no uncertain fashion by no less a personage than the\nOfficer of the Day.\n\n\"... and report yourself under arrest immediately!\" the O.D. concluded\nhis brief but pointed speech.\n\n\"You were right in stopping me, of course,\" the intruder conceded,\nunmoved. \"I wanted to get in there without giving everything away, if\npossible, but it seems that I can't. Well, I've been ordered by Virgil\nSamms to report to the Captain, at once. See this? Touch it!\" He held\nout a flat, insulated disk, cover thrown back to reveal a tiny golden\nmeteor, at the sight of which the officer's truculent manner altered\nmarkedly.\n\n\"I've heard of them, of course, but I never saw one before,\" and the\nofficer touched the shining symbol lightly with his finger, jerking\nbackward as there shot through his whole body a thrilling surge of\npower, shouting into his very bones an unpronounceable syllable--the\npassword of the Triplanetary Service. \"Genuine or not, it gets you to\nthe Captain. He'll know, and if it's a fake you'll be breathing space in\nfive minutes.\"\n\nProjector at the ready, the Officer of the Day followed Cleve into the\nHoly of Holies. There the grizzled four-striper touched the golden\nmeteor lightly, then drove his piercing gaze deep into the unflinching\neyes of the younger man. But that captain had won his high rank neither\nby accident nor by \"pull\"--he understood at once.\n\n\"It _must_ be an emergency,\" he growled, half-audibly, still staring at\nhis lowly Q-M clerk, \"to make Samms uncover this way.\" He turned and\ncurtly dismissed the wondering O.D. Then: \"All right! Out with it!\"\n\n\"Serious enough so that every one of us afloat has just received orders\nto reveal himself to his commanding officer and to anyone else, if\nnecessary to reach that officer at once--orders never before issued. The\nenemy have been located. They have built a base, and have ships better\nthan our best. Base and ships cannot be seen or detected by any ether\nwave. However, the Service has been experimenting for years with a new\ntype of communicator beam; and, while pretty crude yet, it was given to\nus when the _Dione_ went out without leaving a trace. One of our men was\nin the _Hyperion_, managed to stay alive, and has been sending data. I\nam instructed to attach my new phone set to one of the universal plates\nin your conning room, and to see what I can find.\"\n\n\"Go to it!\" The captain waved his hand and the operative bent to his\ntask.\n\n\"Commanders of all vessels of the Fleet!\" The Headquarters speaker,\nreceiver sealed upon the wave-length of the Admiral of the Fleet, broke\nthe long silence. \"All vessels in sectors L to R, inclusive, will\ninterlock location signals. Some of you have received, or will receive\nshortly, certain communications from sources which need not be\nmentioned. Those commanders will at once send out red K4 screens.\nVessels so marked will act as temporary flagships. Unmarked vessels will\nproceed at maximum to the nearest flagship, grouping about it in the\nregulation squadron cone in order of arrival. Squadrons most distant\nfrom objective point designated by flagship observers will proceed\ntoward it at maximum; squadrons nearest it will decelerate or reverse\nvelocity--that point must not be approached until full Fleet formation\nhas been accomplished. Heavy and light cruisers of all other sectors\ninside the orbit of Mars....\" The orders went on, directing the\nmobilization of the stupendous forces of the League, so that they would\nbe in readiness in the highly improbable event of the failure of the\nmassed power of seven sectors to reduce the pirate base.\n\nIn those seven sectors perhaps a dozen vessels threw out enormous\nspherical screens of intense red light, and as they did so their tracer\npoints upon all the interlocked lookout plates also became ringed about\nwith red. Toward those crimson markers the pilots of the unmarked\nvessels directed their courses at their utmost power; and while the\nwhite lights upon the lookout plates moved slowly toward and clustered\nabout the red ones the ultra-instruments of the Service operatives were\nprobing into space, sweeping the neighborhood of the computed position\nof the pirate's stronghold.\n\nBut the object sought was so far away that the small spy-ray sets of the\nService men, intended as they were for close range work, were unable to\nmake contact with the invisible planetoid for which they were seeking.\nIn the captain's sanctum of the _Chicago_, the operative studied his\nplate for only a minute or two, then shut off his power and fell into a\nbrown study, from which he was rudely aroused.\n\n\"Aren't you even going to _try_ to find them?\" demanded the captain.\n\n\"No,\" Cleve returned shortly. \"No use--not half enough power or control.\nI'm trying to think ... maybe ... say, Captain, will you please have the\nChief Electrician and a couple of radio men come in here?\"\n\nThey came, and for hours, while the other ultra-wave men searched the\napparently empty ether with their ineffective beams, the three technical\nexperts and the erstwhile Quartermaster's clerk labored upon a huge and\ncomplex ultra-wave projector--the three blindly and with doubtful\nquestions; the one with sure knowledge at least of what he was trying to\ndo. Finally the thing was done, the crude, but efficient graduated\ncircles were set, and the tubes glowed redly as their massed output\ndrove into a tight beam of ultra-vibration.\n\n\"There it is, sir,\" Cleve reported, after some ten minutes of\nmanipulation, and the vast structure of the miniature world flashed into\nbeing upon his plate. \"You may notify the fleet--coordinates H 11.62, RA\n124-31-16, and Dx about 173.2.\"\n\nThe report made and the assistants out of the room, the captain turned\nto the observer and saluted gravely.\n\n\"We have always known, sir, that the Service had _men_; but I had no\nidea that any one man could possibly do, on the spur of the moment,\nwhat you have just done--unless that man happened to be Lyman\nCleveland.\"\n\n\"Oh, it doesn't....\" the observer began, but broke off, muttering\nunintelligibly at intervals; then swung the visiray beam toward the\nEarth. Soon a face appeared upon the plate; the keen, but careworn face\nof Virgil Samms!\n\n\"Hello, Lyman,\" his voice came clearly from the speaker, and the Captain\ngasped--his ultra-wave observer and sometime clerk was Lyman Cleveland\nhimself, probably the greatest living expert in beam transmission! \"I\nknew that you'd do something, if it could be done. How about it--can the\nothers install similar sets on their ships? I'm betting that they\ncan't.\"\n\n\"Probably not,\" Cleveland frowned in thought. \"This is a patchwork\naffair, made of gunny sacks and hay-wire. I'm holding it together by\nmain strength and awkwardness, and even at that, it's apt to go to\npieces any minute.\"\n\n\"Can you rig it up for photography?\"\n\n\"I think so. Just a minute--yes, I can. Why?\"\n\n\"Because there's something going on out there that neither we nor\napparently the pirates know anything about. The Admiralty seems to think\nthat it's the Jovians again, but we don't see how it can be--if it is,\nthey have developed a lot of stuff that none of our agents has even\nsuspected,\" and he recounted briefly what Costigan had reported to him,\nconcluding: \"Then there was a burst of interference--on the\n_ultra-band_, mind you--and I've heard nothing from him since. Therefore\nI want you to stay out of the battle entirely. Stay as far away from it\nas you can and still get good pictures of everything that happens. I\nwill see that orders are issued to the _Chicago_ to that effect.\"\n\n\"But listen....\"\n\n\"Those are orders!\" snapped Samms. \"It is of the utmost importance that\nwe know every detail of what is going to happen. The answer is pictures.\nThe only possibility of obtaining pictures is that machine you have just\ndeveloped. If the fleet wins, nothing will be lost. If the fleet\nloses--and I am not half as confident of success as the Admiral is--the\n_Chicago_ doesn't carry enough power to decide the issue, and we will\nhave the pictures to study, which is all-important. Besides, we have\nprobably lost Conway Costigan today, and we don't want to lose _you_,\ntoo.\"\n\nCleveland remained silent, pondering this startling news, but the\ngrizzled Captain, veteran of the Fourth Jovian War that he was, was not\nconvinced.\n\n\"We'll blow them out of space, Mr. Samms!\" he declared.\n\n\"You just think you will, Captain. I have suggested, as forcibly as\npossible, that the general attack be withheld until after a thorough\ninvestigation is made, but the Admiralty will not listen. They see the\nadvisability of withdrawing a camera ship, but that is as far as they\nwill go.\"\n\n\"And that's plenty far enough!\" growled the _Chicago's_ commander, as\nthe beam snapped off. \"Mr. Cleveland, I don't like the idea of running\naway under fire, and I won't do it without direct orders from the\nAdmiral.\"\n\n\"Of course you won't--that's why you are going....\"\n\nHe was interrupted by a voice from the Headquarters speaker. The captain\nstepped up to the plate and, upon being recognized, he received the\nexact orders which had been requested by the Chief of the Triplanetary\nService.\n\nThus it was that the _Chicago_ reversed her acceleration, cut off her\nred screen, and fell rapidly behind, while the vessels following her\nshot away toward another crimson-flaring loader. Farther and farther\nback she dropped, back to the limiting range of the mechanism upon which\nCleveland and his highly-trained assistants were hard at work. And\nduring all this time the forces of the seven sectors had been\nconcentrating. The pilot vessels, with their flaming red screens, each\nfollowed by a cone of space-ships, drew closer and closer together,\napproaching the _Fearless_--the British super-dreadnought which was to\nbe the flagship of the Fleet--the mightiest and heaviest space-ship\nwhich had yet lifted her stupendous mass into the ether.\n\nNow, systematically and precisely, the great Cone of Battle was coming\ninto being; a formation developed during the Jovian Wars while the\nforces of the Three Planets were fighting in space for their very\ncivilizations' existence, and one never used since the last space-fleets\nof Jupiter's murderous hordes had been wiped out.\n\nThe mouth of that enormous hollow cone was a ring of scout patrols, the\nsmallest and most agile vessels of the fleet. Behind them came a\nsomewhat smaller ring of light cruisers, then rings of heavy cruisers\nand of light battleships, and finally of heavy battleships. At the apex\nof the cone, protected by all the other vessels of the formation and in\nbest position to direct the battle, was the flagship. In this formation\nevery vessel was free to use her every weapon, with a minimum of danger\nto her sister ships; and yet, when the gigantic main projectors were\noperated along the axis of the formation, from the entire vast circle of\nthe cone's mouth there flamed a cylindrical field of force of such\nintolerable intensity that in it no conceivable substance could endure\nfor a moment!\n\nThe artificial planet of metal was now close enough so that it was\nvisible to the ultra-vision of the Service men, so plainly visible that\nthe cigar-shaped warships of the pirates were seen issuing from the\nenormous airlocks. As each vessel shot out into space it sped straight\nfor the approaching fleet without waiting to go into any formation--gray\nRoger believed his structures invisible to Triplanetary eyes, thought\nthat the presence of the fleet was the result of mathematical\ncalculations, and was convinced that his mighty vessels of the void\nwould destroy even that vast fleet without themselves becoming known. He\nwas wrong. The foremost vessels were allowed actually to enter the mouth\nof that conical trap before an offensive move was made. Then the\nvice-admiral in command of the fleet touched a button, and\nsimultaneously every generator in every Triplanetary vessel burst into\nfurious activity. Instantly the hollow volume of the immense cone became\na coruscating hell of resistless energy, an inferno which with the\nvelocity of light extended itself into a far-reaching cylinder of\nrapacious destruction. Ether-waves they were, it is true, but vibrations\ndriven with such fierce intensity that the screens of deflection\nsurrounding the pirate vessels could not handle even a fraction of their\nawful power. Invisibility lost, their defensive screens flared briefly;\nbut even the enormous force backing Roger's inventions, far greater than\nthat of any single Triplanetary vessel, could not hold off the\nincredible violence of the massed attack of the hundreds of mighty\nvessels composing the Fleet. Their defensive screens flared briefly,\nthen went down; their great hulls first glowing red, then shining white,\nthen in a brief moment exploding into flying masses of red hot, molten,\nand gaseous metal.\n\nA full two-thirds of Roger's force was caught in that raging,\nincandescent beam; caught and obliterated: but the remainder did not\nretreat to the planetoid. Darting out around the edge of the cone at a\nstupendous acceleration, they attacked its flanks and the engagement\nbecame general. But now, since enough beams were kept upon each ship of\nthe enemy so that invisibility could not be restored, each Triplanetary\nwar vessel could attack with full efficiency. Magnesium flares and\nstar-shells illuminated space for a thousand miles, and from every unit\nof both fleets was being hurled every item of solid, explosive and\nvibratory destruction known to the warfare of that age. Offensive beams,\nrods and daggers of frightful power struck and were neutralized by\ndefensive screens equally capable; the long range and furious dodging\nmade ordinary solid, or even atomic-explosive projectiles useless; and\nboth sides were filling all space with such a volume of blanketing\nfrequencies that such radio-dirigible atomics as were launched could not\nbe controlled, but darted madly and erratically hither and thither,\nfinally to be exploded or volatilized harmlessly in mid-space by the\ntouch of some fiercely insistant, probing beam of force.\n\nIndividually, however, the pirate vessels were far more powerful than\nthose of the fleet, and that superiority soon began to make itself felt.\nThe power of the smaller ships began to fail as their accumulators\nbecame discharged under the awful drain of the battle, and vessel after\nvessel of the Triplanetary fleet was hurled into nothingness by the\nconcentrated blasts of the pirates' rays. But the Triplanetary forces\nhad one great advantage. In furious haste the Service men had been\naltering the controls of the dirigible atomic torpedoes, so that they\nwould respond to ultra-wave control; and, few in number though they\nwere, each was highly effective.\n\nA hard-eyed observer, face almost against his plate and both hands and\nboth feet manipulating controls, hurled the first torpedo. Propelling\nrockets viciously aflame, it twisted and looped around the incandescent\nrods of destruction so thickly and starkly outlined, under perfect\ncontrol; unaffected by the hideous distortion of all ether-borne\nsignals. Through a pirate screen it went, and under the terrific blast\nof its detonation the entire midsection of the stricken battleship\nvanished. It should have been out, cold--but to the amazement of the\nobservers, both ends kept on fighting with scarcely lessened power! Two\nmore of the frightful bombs had to be launched--each remaining section\nhad to be blown to bits--before those terrible beams went out! Not a man\nin that great fleet had even an inkling of the truth; that those great\nvessels, those awful engines of destruction, did not contain a single\nliving creature: that they were manned and fought by automatons; robots\ncontrolled by keen-eyed, space-hardened veterans inside the pirates'\nplanetoid!\n\nBut they were to receive an inkling of it. As ship after ship of the\npirate fleet was destroyed, Roger realized that his navy was beaten, and\nforthwith all his surviving vessels darted toward the apex of the cone,\nwhere the heaviest battleships were stationed. There each hurled itself\nupon a Triplanetary warship, crashing to its own destruction, but in\nthat destruction insuring the loss of one of the heaviest vessels of the\nenemy. Thus passed the _Fearless_, and twenty of the finest space-ships\nof the fleet as well. But the ranking officer assumed command, the\nwar-cone was re-formed, and, yawning maw to the fore, the great\nformation shot toward the pirate stronghold, now near at hand. It again\nlaunched its stupendous cylinder of annihilation, but even as the mighty\ndefensive screens of the planetoid flared into incandescently furious\ndefense, the battle was interrupted and pirates and Triplanetarians\nlearned alike that they were not alone in the ether.\n\nSpace became suffused with a redly impenetrable opacity, and through\nthat indescribable pall there came reaching huge arms of force\nincredible; writhing, coruscating beams of power which glowed a baleful,\nalthough almost imperceptible, red. A vessel of unheard-of armament and\npower, hailing from the then unknown solar system of Nevia, had come to\nrest in that space. For months her commander had been searching for one\nultra-precious substance. Now his detectors had found it; and, feeling\nneither fear of Triplanetarian weapons nor reluctance to sacrifice those\nthousands of Triplanetarian lives, he was about to take it!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\nWITHIN THE RED VEIL\n\n\nNevia, the home planet of the marauding space-ship, would have appeared\npeculiar indeed to Terrestrial senses. High in the deep red heavens a\nfervent blue sun poured down its flood of brilliant purplish light upon\na world of water. Not a cloud was to be seen in that flaming sky, and\nthrough that dustless atmosphere the eye could see the horizon--a\nhorizon three times as distant as the one to which we are\naccustomed--with a distinctness and clarity impossible in our Terra's\ndust-filled air. As that mighty sun dropped below the horizon the sky\nwould fill suddenly with clouds and rain would fall violently and\nsteadily until midnight. Then the clouds would vanish as suddenly as\nthey had come into being, the torrential downpour would cease, and\nthrough that huge world's wonderfully transparent gaseous envelope the\nfull glory of the firmament would be revealed. Not the firmament as we\nknow it--for that hot blue sun and Nevia, her one planet-child, were\nlight-years distant from Old Sol and his numerous brood--but a strange\nand glorious firmament containing few constellations familiar to Earthly\neyes.\n\nOut of the vacuum of space a fish-shaped vessel of the void--the vessel\nthat was to attack so boldly both the massed fleet of Triplanetary and\nRoger's planetoid--plunged into the rarefied outer atmosphere, and\ncrimson beams of force tore shriekingly through the thin air as it\nbraked its terrific speed. A third of the circumference of Nevia's\nmighty globe was traversed before the velocity of the craft could be\nreduced sufficiently to make a landing possible. Then, approaching the\ntwilight zone, the vessel dived vertically downward, and it became\nevident that Nevia was neither entirely aqueous nor devoid of\nintelligent life. For the blunt nose of the space-ship was pointing\ntoward what was evidently a half-submerged city, a city whose buildings\nwere flat-topped, hexagonal towers, exactly alike in size, shape, color,\nand material. These buildings were arranged as the cells of a honeycomb\nwould be if each cell were separated from its neighbors by a relatively\nnarrow channel of water, and all were built of the same white metal.\nMany bridges and more tubes extended through the air from building to\nbuilding, and the watery \"streets\" teemed with swimmers, with surface\ncraft, and with submarines.\n\nThe pilot, stationed immediately below the conical prow of the\nspace-ship, peered intently through thick windows which afforded\nunobstructed vision in every direction. His four huge and contractile\neyes were active, each operating independently in sending its own\nmessage to his peculiar but capable brain. One was watching the\ninstruments, the others scanned narrowly the immense, swelling curve of\nthe ship's belly, the water upon which his vessel was to land, and the\nfloating dock to which it was to be moored. Four hands--if hands they\ncould be called--manipulated levers and wheels with infinite delicacy of\ntouch, and with scarcely a splash the immense mass of the Nevian vessel\nstruck the water and glided to a stop within a foot of its exact berth.\n\nFour mooring bars dropped neatly into their sockets and the\ncaptain-pilot, after locking his controls in neutral, released his\nsafety straps and leaped lightly from his padded bench to the floor.\nScuttling across the floor and down a runway upon his four short,\npowerful, heavily scaled legs, he slipped smoothly into the water and\nflashed away, far below the surface. For Nevians are true amphibians.\nTheir blood is cold; they use with equal comfort and efficiency gills\nand lungs for breathing; their scaly bodies are equally at home in the\nwater or in the air; their broad, flat feet serve equally well for\nrunning about upon a solid surface or for driving their streamlined\nbodies through the water at a pace few fishes can equal.\n\nThrough the water the Nevian commander darted along, steering his course\naccurately by means of his short, vaned tail. Through an opening in a\nwall he sped and along a submarine hallway, emerging upon a broad ramp.\nHe scurried up the incline and into an elevator which lifted him to the\ntop of the hexagon, directly into the office of the Secretary of\nCommerce of all Nevia.\n\n\"Welcome, Captain Nerado!\" The Secretary waved a tentacular arm and the\nvisitor sprang lightly upon a softly cushioned bench, where he lay at\nease, facing the official across his low, flat \"desk.\" \"We congratulate\nyou upon the success of your final trial flight. We received all your\nreports, even while you were traveling at ten times the velocity of\nlight. With the last difficulties overcome, you are now ready to start?\"\n\n\"We are ready,\" the captain-scientist replied, soberly. \"Mechanically,\nthe ship is as nearly perfect as our finest minds can make her. She is\nstocked for two years. All the iron-bearing suns within reach have been\nplotted. Everything is ready except the iron. Of course the Council\nrefused to allow us any of the national supply--how much were you able\nto purchase for us in the market?\"\n\n\"Nearly ten pounds....\"\n\n\"Ten pounds! Why, the securities we left with you could not have bought\ntwo pounds, even at the price then prevailing!\"\n\n\"No, but you have friends. Many of us believe in you, and have dipped\ninto our own resources. You and your fellow scientists of the expedition\nhave each contributed his entire personal fortune; why should not some\nof the rest of us also contribute, as private citizens?\"\n\n\"Wonderful--we thank you. Ten pounds!\" The captain's great triangular\neyes glowed with an intense violet light. \"At least a year of cruising.\nBut ... what if, after all, we should be wrong?\"\n\n\"In that case you shall have consumed ten pounds of irreplaceable\nmetal.\" The Secretary was unmoved. \"That is the viewpoint of the Council\nand of almost everyone else. It is not the waste of treasure they object\nto; it is the fact that ten pounds of iron will be forever lost.\"\n\n\"A high price, truly,\" the Columbus of Nevia assented. \"And after all, I\nmay be wrong.\"\n\n\"You probably are wrong,\" his host made startling answer. \"It is\npractically certain--it is almost a demonstrable mathematical fact--that\nno other sun within hundreds of thousands of light-years of our own has\na planet. In all probability Nevia is the only planet in the entire\nUniverse. We are very probably the only intelligent life in the\nUniverse. There is only one chance in numberless millions that anywhere\nwithin the cruising range of your newly perfected space-ship there may\nbe an iron-bearing planet upon which you can effect a landing. There is\na larger chance, however, that you may be able to find a small, cold,\niron-bearing cosmic body--small enough so that you can capture it.\nAlthough there are no mathematics by which to evaluate the probability\nof such an occurrence, it is upon that larger chance that some of us are\nstaking a portion of our wealth. We expect no return whatever, but if\nyou _should_ by some miracle happen to succeed, what then? Deep seas\nbeing made shallow, civilization extending itself over the globe,\nscience advancing by leaps and bounds, Nevia becoming populated as she\nshould be peopled--that, my friend, is a chance well worth taking!\"\n\nThe Secretary called in a group of guards, who escorted the small\npackage of priceless metal to the space-ship. Before the massive door\nwas sealed the friends bade each other farewell.\n\n\"... I will keep in touch with you on the ultra-wave,\" the Captain\nconcluded. \"After all, I do not blame the Council for refusing to allow\nthe other ship to go out. Ten pounds of iron will be a fearful loss to\nthe world. If we _should_ find iron, however, see to it that she loses\nno time in following us.\"\n\n\"No fear of that! If you find iron she will set out at once, and all\nspace will soon be full of vessels. Goodbye.\"\n\nThe last opening was sealed and Nerado shot the great vessel into the\nair. Up and up, out beyond the last tenuous trace of atmosphere, on and\non through space it flew with ever-increasing velocity until Nevia's\ngigantic blue sun had been left so far behind that it became a splendid\nblue-white star. Then, projectors cut off to save the precious iron\nwhose disintegration furnished them power, for week after week Captain\nNerado and his venturesome crew of scientists drifted idly through the\nillimitable void.\n\nThere is no need to describe in detail Nerado's tremendous voyage.\nSuffice it to say that he found a G-type dwarf star possessing\nplanets--not one planet only, but six ... seven ... eight ... yes, at\nleast nine! And most of those worlds were themselves centers of\nattraction around which were circling one or more worldlets! Nerado\nthrilled with joy as he applied a full retarding force, and every\ncreature aboard that great vessel had to peer into a plate or through a\ntelescope before he could believe that planets other than Nevia did in\nreality exist!\n\nVelocity checked to the merest crawl, as space-speeds go, and with\nelectro-magnetic detector screens full out, the Nevian vessel crept\ntoward our sun. Finally the detectors encountered an obstacle, a\nconductive substance which the patterns showed conclusively to be\npractically pure iron. Iron--an enormous mass of it--floating alone out\nin space! Without waiting to investigate the nature, appearance, or\nstructure of the precious mass, Nerado ordered power into the converters\nand drove an enormous softening field of force upon the object--a force\nof such a nature that it would condense the metallic iron into an\nallotropic modification of much smaller bulk; a red, viscous, extremely\ndense and heavy liquid which could be stored conveniently in his tanks.\n\nNo sooner had the precious fluid been stored away than the detectors\nagain broke into an uproar. In one direction was an enormous mass of\niron, scarcely detectable; in another a great number of smaller masses;\nin a third an isolated mass, comparatively small in size. Space seemed\nto be full of iron, and Nerado drove his most powerful beam toward\ndistant Nevia and sent an exultant message.\n\n\"We have found iron--easily obtained and in unthinkable quantity--not in\nfractions of milligrams, but in millions upon unmeasured millions of\ntons! Send our sister ship here at once!\"\n\n\"Nerado!\" The captain was called to one of the observation plates as\nsoon as he had opened his key. \"I have been investigating the mass of\niron now nearest us, the small one. It is an artificial structure, a\nsmall space-boat, and there are three creatures in it--monstrosities\ncertainly, but they must possess some intelligence or they could not be\nnavigating space.\"\n\n\"What? Impossible!\" exclaimed the chief explorer. \"Probably, then, the\nother was--but no matter, we had to have the iron. Bring the boat in\nwithout converting it, so that we may study at our leisure both the\nbeings and their mechanisms,\" and Nerado swung his own visiray beam into\nthe emergency boat, seeing there the armored figures of Clio Marsden and\nthe two Triplanetary officers.\n\n\"They are indeed intelligent,\" Nerado commented, as he detected and\nsilenced Costigan's ultra-beam communicator. \"Not, however, as\nintelligent as I had supposed,\" he went on, after studying the peculiar\ncreatures and their tiny space-ship more in detail. \"They have immense\nstores of iron, yet use it for nothing other than building material.\nThey make little and inefficient use of atomic energy. They apparently\nhave a rudimentary knowledge of ultra-waves, but do not use them\nintelligently--they cannot neutralize even these ordinary forces we are\nnow employing. They are of course more intelligent than the lower\nganoids, or even than some of the higher fishes, but by no stretch of\nthe imagination can they be compared to us. I am quite relieved--I was\nafraid that in my haste I might have slain members of a highly developed\nrace.\"\n\nThe helpless boat, all her forces neutralized, was brought up close to\nthe immense flying fish. There flaming knives of force sliced her neatly\ninto sections and the three rigid armored figures, after being bereft of\ntheir external weapons, were brought through the airlocks and into the\ncontrol room, while the pieces of their boat were stored away for future\nstudy. The Nevian scientists first analyzed the air inside the\nspace-suits of the Terrestrials, then carefully removed the protective\ncoverings of the captives.\n\nCostigan--fully conscious through it all and now able to move a little,\nsince the peculiar temporary paralysis was wearing off--braced himself\nfor he knew not what shock, but it was needless; their grotesque captors\nwere not torturers. The air, while somewhat more dense than Earth's and\nof a peculiar odor, was eminently breathable, and even though the vessel\nwas motionless in space an almost-normal gravitation gave them a large\nfraction of their usual weight.\n\nAfter the three had been relieved of their pistols and other articles\nwhich the Nevians thought might prove to be weapons, the strange\nparalysis was lifted entirely. The Earthly clothing puzzled the captors\nimmensely, but so strenuous were the objections raised to its removal\nthat they did not press the point, but fell back to study their find in\ndetail.\n\nThen faced each other the representatives of the civilizations of two\nwidely separated solar systems. The Nevians studied the human beings\nwith interest and curiosity blended largely with loathing and repulsion;\nthe three Terrestrials regarded the unmoving, expressionless \"faces\"--if\nthose coned heads could be said to possess such thing--with horror and\ndisgust, as well as with other emotions, each according to his type and\ntraining. For to human eyes the Nevian is a fearful thing. Even today\nthere are few Terrestrials--or Solarians, for that matter--who can look\nat a Nevian, eye to eye, without feeling a creeping of the skin and\nexperiencing a \"gone\" sensation in the pit of the stomach. The horny,\nwrinkled, drought-resisting Martian, whom we all know and rather like,\nis a hideous being indeed. The bat-eyed, colorless, hairless,\npractically skinless Venerian is worse. But they both are, after all,\nremote cousins of Terra's humanity, and we get along with them quite\nwell whenever we are compelled to visit Mars or Venus. But the Nevians--\n\nThe horizontal, flat, fish-like body is not so bad, even supported as it\nis by four short, powerful, scaly, flat-footed legs; and terminating as\nit does in the weird, four-vaned tail. The neck, even, is endurable,\nalthough it is long and flexible, heavily scaled, and is carried in\nwhatever eye-wringing loops or curves the owner considers most\nconvenient or ornamental at the time. Even the smell of a Nevian--a\nmalodorous reek of over-ripe fish--does in time become tolerable,\nespecially if sufficiently disguised with creosote, which purely\nTerrestrial chemical is the most highly prized perfume of Nevia. But the\nhead! It is that member that makes the Nevian so appalling to Earthly\neyes, for it is a thing utterly foreign to all Solarian history or\nexperience. As most Tellurians already know, it is fundamentally a\nmassive cone, covered with scales, based spearhead-like upon the neck.\nFour great sea-green, triangular eyes are spaced equidistant from each\nother about half way up the cone. The pupils are contractile at will,\nlike the eyes of the cat, permitting the Nevian to see equally well in\nany ordinary extreme of light or darkness. Immediately below each eye\nsprings out a long, jointless, boneless, tentacular arm; an arm which at\nits extremity divides into eight delicate and sensitive, but very\nstrong, \"fingers.\" Below each arm is a mouth: a beaked, needle-tusked\norifice of dire potentialities. Finally, under the overhanging edge of\nthe cone-shaped head are the delicately-frilled organs which serve\neither as gills or as nostrils and lungs, as may be desired. To other\nNevians the eyes and other features are highly expressive, but to us\nthey appear utterly cold and unmoving. Terrestrial senses can detect no\nchanges of expression in a Nevian's \"face.\" Such were the frightful\nbeings at whom the three prisoners stared with sinking hearts.\n\nBut if we human beings have always considered Nevians grotesque and\nrepulsive, the feeling has always been mutual. For those \"monstrous\"\nbeings are a highly intelligent and extremely sensitive race, and\nour--to us--trim and graceful human forms seem to them the very\nquintessence of malformation and hideousness.\n\n\"Good Heavens, Conway!\" Clio exclaimed, shrinking against Costigan as\nhis left arm flashed around her. \"What horrible monstrosities! And they\ncan't talk--not one of them has made a sound--suppose they can be deaf\nand dumb?\"\n\nBut at the same time Nerado was addressing his fellows.\n\n\"What hideous, deformed creatures they are! Truly a low form of life,\neven though they do possess some intelligence. They cannot talk, and\nhave made no signs of having heard our words to them--do you suppose\nthat they communicate by sight? That those weird contortions of their\npeculiarly placed organs serve as speech?\"\n\nThus both sides, neither realizing that the other had spoken. For the\nNevian voice is pitched so high that the lowest note audible to them is\nfar above our limit of hearing. The shrillest note of a Terrestrial\npiccolo is to them so profoundly low that it cannot be heard.\n\n\"We have much to do.\" Nerado turned away from the captives. \"We must\npostpone further study of the specimens until we have taken aboard a\nfull cargo of the iron which is so plentiful here.\"\n\n\"What shall we do with them, sir?\" asked one of the Nevian officers.\n\"Lock them in one of the storage rooms?\"\n\n\"Oh, no! They might die there, and we must by all means keep them in\ngood condition, to be studied most carefully by the fellows of the\nCollege of Science. What a commotion there will be when we bring in this\ngroup of strange creatures, living proof that there are other suns\npossessing planets; planets which are supporting organic and intelligent\nlife! You may put them in three communicating rooms, say in the fourth\nsection--they will undoubtedly require light and exercise. Lock all the\nexits, of course, but it would be best to leave the doors between the\nrooms unlocked, so that they can be together or apart, as they choose.\nSince the smallest one, the female, stays so close to the larger male,\nit may be that they are mates. But since we know nothing of their habits\nor customs, it will be best to give them all possible freedom compatible\nwith safety.\"\n\nNerado turned back to his instruments and three of the frightful crew\ncame up to the human beings. One walked away, waving a couple of arms in\nan unmistakable signal that the prisoners were to follow him. The three\nobediently set out after him, the other two guards falling behind.\n\n\"Now's our best chance!\" Costigan muttered, as they passed through a low\ndoorway and entered a narrow corridor. \"Watch that one ahead of you,\nClio--hold him for a second if you can. Bradley, you and I will take the\ntwo behind us--now!\"\n\nCostigan stooped and whirled. Seizing a cable-like arm, he pulled the\noutlandish head down, the while the full power of his mighty right leg\ndrove a heavy service boot into the place where scaly neck and head\njoined. The Nevian fell, and instantly Costigan leaped at the leader,\nahead of the girl. Leaped; but dropped to the floor, again paralyzed.\nFor the Nevian leader had been alert, his four eyes covering the entire\ncircle of vision, and he had acted rapidly. Not in time to stop\nCostigan's first berserk attack--the First Officer's reactions were\npractically instantaneous and he moved fast--but in time to retain\ncommand of the situation. Another Nevian appeared, and while the\nstricken guard was recovering, all four arms wrapped tightly around his\nconvulsively looping, writhing neck, the three helpless Terrestrials\nwere lifted into the air and carried bodily into the quarters to which\nNerado had assigned them. Not until they had been placed upon cushions\nin the middle room and the heavy metal doors had been locked upon them\ndid they again find themselves able to use arms or legs.\n\n\"Well, that's another round we lose,\" Costigan commented, cheerfully. \"A\nguy can't mix it very well when he can neither kick, strike, nor bite. I\nexpected those lizards to rough me up then, but they didn't.\"\n\n\"They don't want to hurt us. They want to take us home with them,\nwherever that is, as curiosities, like wild animals or something,\"\ndecided the girl, shrewdly. \"They're pretty bad, of course, but I like\nthem a lot better than I do Roger and his robots, anyway.\"\n\n\"I think you have the right idea, Miss Marsden,\" Bradley rumbled.\n\"That's it, exactly. I feel like a bear in a cage. I should think you'd\nfeel worse than ever. What chance has an animal of escaping from a\nmenagerie?\"\n\n\"These animals, lots. I'm feeling better and better all the time,\" Clio\ndeclared, and her serene bearing bore out her words. \"You two got us out\nof that horrible place of Roger's, and I'm pretty sure that you will get\nus away from here, somehow or other. They may think we're stupid\nanimals, but before you two and the Triplanetary Patrol and the Service\nget done with them they'll have another think coming.\"\n\n\"That's the old fight, Clio!\" cheered Costigan. \"I haven't got it\nfigured out as close as you have, but I get about the same answer. These\nfour-legged fish carry considerably heavier stuff than Roger did, I'm\nthinking; but they'll be up against something themselves pretty quick\nthat is _no_ light-weight, believe me!\"\n\n\"Do you know something, or are you just whistling in the dark?\" Bradley\ndemanded.\n\n\"I know a little; not much. Engineering and Research have been working\non a new ship for a long time; a ship to travel so much faster than\nlight that it can go anywhere in the Galaxy and back in a month or so.\nNew sub-ether drive, new atomic power, new armament, new everything.\nOnly bad thing about it is that it doesn't work so good yet--it's fuller\nof bugs than a Venerian's kitchen. It has blown up five times that I\nknow of, and has killed twenty-nine men. But when they get it licked\nthey'll _have something_!\"\n\n\"When, or if?\" asked Bradley, pessimistically.\n\n\"I said _when_!\" snapped Costigan, his voice cutting. \"When the Service\ngoes after anything they get it, and when they get it it _stays_....\" He\nbroke off abruptly and his voice lost its edge. \"Sorry. Didn't mean to\nget high, but I think we'll have help, if we can keep our heads up a\nwhile. And it looks good--these are first-class cages they've given us.\nAll the comforts of home, even to lookout plates. Let's see what's going\non, shall we?\"\n\nAfter some experimenting with the unfamiliar controls Costigan learned\nhow to operate the Nevian visiray, and upon the plate they saw the Cone\nof Battle hurling itself toward Roger's planetoid. They saw the pirate\nfleet rush out to do battle with Triplanetary's massed forces, and with\nbated breath they watched every maneuver of that epic battle to its\nsavagely sacrificial end. And that same battle was being watched, also\nwith the most intense interest, by the Nevians in their control room.\n\n\"It is indeed a bloodthirsty combat,\" mused Nerado at his observation\nplate. \"And it is peculiar--or rather, probably only to be expected from\na race of such a low stage of development--that they employ only\nether-borne forces. Warfare seems universal among primitive\ntypes--indeed, it is not so long ago that our own cities, few in number\nthough they are, ceased fighting each other and combined against the\nsemicivilized fishes of the greater deeps.\"\n\nHe fell silent, and for many minutes watched the furious battle between\nthe two navies of the void. That conflict ended, he watched the\nTriplanetary fleet reform its battle cone and rush upon the planetoid.\n\n\"Destruction, always destruction,\" he sighed, adjusting his power\nswitches. \"Since they are bent upon mutual destruction I can see no\npurpose in refraining from destroying all of them. We need the iron, and\nthey are a useless race.\"\n\nHe launched his softening, converting field of dull red energy. Vast as\nthat field was, it could not encompass the whole fleet, but half of the\nlip of the gigantic cone soon disappeared, its component vessels\nsubsiding into a sluggishly flowing stream of allotropic iron. The\nfleet, abandoning its attack upon the planetoid, swung its cone around,\nto bring the flame-erupting axis to bear upon the formless something\ndimly perceptible to the ultra-vision of Samms' observers. Furiously the\ngigantic composite beam of the massed fleet was hurled, nor was it\nalone.\n\nFor Gharlane had known, ever since the easy escape of his human\nprisoners, that something was occurring which was completely beyond his\nexperience, although not beyond his theoretical knowledge. He had found\nthe sub-ether closed; he had been unable to make his sub-ethereal\nweapons operative against either the three captives or the war-vessels\nof the Triplanetary Patrol. Now, however, he could work in the\nsub-ethereal murk of the newcomers; a light trial showed him that if he\nso wished he could use sub-ethereal offenses against them. What was the\nreal meaning of those facts?\n\nHe had become convinced that those three persons were no more human than\nwas Roger himself. Who or what was activating them? It was definitely\nnot Eddorian workmanship; no Eddorian would have developed those\nparticular techniques, nor could possibly have developed them without\nhis knowledge. What, then? To do what had been done necessitated the\nexistence of a race as old and as capable as the Eddorians, but of an\nentirely different nature; and, according to Eddore's vast Information\nCenter, no such race existed or ever had existed.\n\nThose visitors, possessing mechanisms supposedly known only to the\nscience of Eddore, would also be expected to possess the mental powers\nwhich had been exhibited. Were they recent arrivals from some other\nspace-time continuum? Probably not--Eddorian surveys had found no trace\nof any such life in any reachable plenum. Since it would be utterly\nfantastic to postulate the unheralded appearance of two such races at\npractically the same moment, the conclusion seemed unavoidable that\nthese as yet unknown beings were the protectors--the activators,\nrather--of the two Triplanetary officers and the woman. This view was\nsupported by the fact that while the strangers had attacked\nTriplanetary's fleet and had killed thousands of Triplanetary's men,\nthey had actually rescued those three supposedly human beings. The\nplanetoid, then would be attacked next. Very well, he would join\nTriplanetary in attacking them--with weapons no more dangerous to them\nthan Triplanetary's own--the while preparing his real attack, which\nwould come later. Roger issued orders; and waited; and thought more and\nmore intensely upon one point which remained obscure--why, when the\nstrangers themselves destroyed Triplanetary's fleet, had Roger been\nunable to use his most potent weapons against that fleet?\n\nThus, then, for the first time in Triplanetary's history, the forces of\nlaw and order joined hands with those of piracy and banditry against a\ncommon foe. Rods, beams, planes, and stilettos of unbearable energy the\ndoomed fleet launched, in addition to its terrifically destructive main\nbeam: Roger hurled every material weapon at his command. But bombs,\nhigh-explosive shells, even the ultra-deadly atomic torpedoes, alike\nwere ineffective; alike simply vanished in the redly murky veil of\nnothingness. And the fleet was being melted. In quick succession the\nvessels flamed red, shrank together, gave out their air, and merged\ntheir component iron into the intensely crimson, sullenly viscous stream\nwhich was flowing through the impenetrable veil against which both\nTriplanetarians and pirates were directing their terrific offense.\n\nThe last vessel of the attacking cone having been converted and the\nresulting metal stored away, the Nevians--as Roger had anticipated--turned\ntheir attention toward the planetoid. But that structure was no feeble\nwarship. It had been designed by, and built under the personal supervision\nof, Gharlane of Eddore. It was powered, equipped, and armed to meet any\nemergency which Gharlane's tremendous mind had been able to envision.\nIts entire bulk was protected by the shield whose qualities had so\nsurprised Costigan; a shield far more effective than any Tellurian\nscientist or engineer would have believed possible.\n\nThe voracious converting beam of the Nevians, below the level of the\nether though it was, struck that shield and rebounded; defeated and\nfutile. Struck again, again rebounded; then struck and clung hungrily,\nlicking out over that impermeable surface in darting tongues of flame as\nthe surprised Nerado doubled and then quadrupled his power. Fiercer and\nfiercer the Nevian flood of force drove in. The whole immense globe of\nthe planetoid became one scintillant ball of raw, red energy; but still\nthe pirates' shield remained intact.\n\nGray Roger sat coldly motionless at his great desk, the top of which was\nnow swung up to become a panel of massed and tiered instruments and\ncontrols. He could carry this load forever--but unless he was very\nwrong, this load would change shortly. What then? The essence that was\nGharlane could not be killed--could not even be hurt--by any physical,\nchemical, or nuclear force. Should he stay with the planetoid to its\nend, and thus perforce return to Eddore with no material evidence\nwhatever? He would not. Too much remained undone. Any report based upon\nhis present information could be neither complete nor conclusive, and\nreports submitted by Gharlane of Eddore to the coldly cynical and\nruthlessly analytical innermost Circle had always been and always would\nbe both.\n\nIt was a fact that there existed at least one non-Eddorian mind which\nwas the equal of his own. If one, there would be a race of such minds.\nThe thought was galling; but to deny the existence of a fact would be\nthe essence of stupidity. Since power of mind was a function of time,\nthat race must be of approximately the same age as his own. Therefore\nthe Eddorian Information Center, which by the inference of its\ncompleteness denied the existence of such a race, was wrong. It was not\ncomplete.\n\nWhy was it not complete? The only possible reason for two such races\nremaining unaware of the existence of each other would be the deliberate\nintent of one of them. Therefore, at some time in the past, the two\nraces had been in contact for at least an instant of time. All Eddorian\nknowledge of that meeting had been suppressed and no more contacts had\nbeen allowed to occur.\n\nThe conclusion reached by Gharlane was a disturbing thing indeed; but,\nbeing an Eddorian, he faced it squarely. He did not have to wonder how\nsuch a suppression could have been accomplished--he knew. He also knew\nthat his own mind contained everything known to his every ancestor since\nthe first Eddorian was: the probability was exceedingly great that if\nany such contact had ever been made his mind would still contain at\nleast some information concerning it, however carefully suppressed that\nknowledge had been.\n\nHe thought. Back ... back ... farther back ... farther still....\n\nAnd as he thought, an interfering force began to pluck at him; as though\npalpable tongs were pulling out of line the mental probe with which he\nwas exploring the hitherto unplumbed recesses of his mind.\n\n\"Ah ... so you do not want me to remember?\" Roger asked aloud, with no\nchange in any lineament of his hard, gray face. \"I wonder ... do you\nreally believe that you can keep me from remembering? I must abandon\nthis search for the moment, but rest assured that I shall finish it very\nshortly.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Here is the analysis of his screen, sir.\" A Nevian computer handed his\nchief a sheet of metal, bearing rows of symbols.\n\n\"Ah, a polycyclic ... complete coverage ... a screen of that type was\nscarcely to have been expected from such a low form of life,\" Nerado\ncommented, and began to adjust dials and controls.\n\nAs he did so the character of the clinging mantle of force changed. From\nred it flamed quickly through the spectrum, became unbearably violet,\nthen disappeared; and as it disappeared the shielding wall began to give\nway. It did not cave in abruptly, but softened locally, sagging into a\npeculiar grouping of valleys and ridges--contesting stubbornly every\ninch of position lost.\n\nRoger experimented briefly with inertialessness. No use. As he had\nexpected, they were prepared for that. He summoned a few of the ablest\nof his scientist-slaves and issued instructions. For minutes a host of\nrobots toiled mightily, then a portion of the shield bulged out and\nbecame a tube extending beyond the attacking layers of force; a tube\nfrom which there erupted a beam of violence incredible. A beam behind\nwhich was every erg of energy that the gigantic mechanisms of the\nplanetoid could yield. A beam that tore a hole through the redly\nimpenetrable Nevian field and hurled itself upon the inner screen of the\nfish-shaped cruiser in frenzied incandescence. And was there, or was\nthere not, a lesser eruption upon the other side--an almost\nimperceptible flash, as though something had shot from the doomed\nplanetoid out into space?\n\nNerado's neck writhed convulsively as his tortured drivers whined and\nshrieked at the terrific overload; but Roger's effort was far too\nintense to be long maintained. Generator after generator burned out, the\ndefensive screen collapsed, and the red converter beam attacked\nvoraciously the unresisting metal of those prodigious walls. Soon there\nwas a terrific explosion as the pent-up air of the planetoid broke\nthrough its weakening container, and the sluggish river of allotropic\niron flowed in an ever larger stream, ever faster.\n\n\"It is well that we had an unlimited supply of iron.\" Nerado almost tied\na knot in his neck as he spoke in huge relief. \"With but the seven\npounds remaining of our original supply, I fear that it would have been\ndifficult to parry that last thrust.\"\n\n\"Difficult?\" asked the second in command. \"We would now be free atoms in\nspace. But what shall I do with this iron? Our reservoirs will not hold\nmore than half of it. And how about that one ship which remains\nuntouched?\"\n\n\"Jettison enough supplies from the lower holds to make room for this\nlot. As for that one ship, let it go. We will be overloaded as it is,\nand it is of the utmost importance that we get back to Nevia as soon as\npossible.\"\n\nThis, if Gharlane could have heard it, would have answered his question.\nAll Arisia knew that it was _necessary_ for the camera-ship to survive.\nThe Nevians were interested only in iron; but the Eddorian, being a\nperfectionist, would not have been satisfied with anything less than the\ncomplete destruction of every vessel of Triplanetary's fleet.\n\nThe Nevian space-ship moved away, sluggishly now because of its\nprodigious load. In their quarters in the fourth section the three\nTerrestrials, who had watched with strained attention the downfall and\nabsorption of the planetoid, stared at each other with drawn faces. Clio\nbroke the silence.\n\n\"Oh, Conway, this is ghastly! It's ... it's just simply too damned\nperfectly horrible!\" she gasped, then recovered a measure of her\ncustomary spirit as she stared in surprise at Costigan's face. For it\nwas thoughtful, his eyes were bright and keen--no trace of fear or\ndisorganization was visible in any line of his hard young face.\n\n\"It's not so good,\" he admitted frankly. \"I wish I wasn't such a dumb\ncluck--if Lyman Cleveland or Fred Rodebush were here they could help a\nlot, but I don't know enough about any of their stuff to flag a\nhand-car. I can't even interpret that funny flash--if it really was a\nflash--that we saw.\"\n\n\"Why bother about one little flash, after all that really did happen?\"\nasked Clio, curiously.\n\n\"You think Roger launched something? He couldn't have--I didn't see a\nthing,\" Bradley argued.\n\n\"I don't know what to think. I've never seen anything material sent out\nso fast that I couldn't trace it with an ultra-wave--but on the other\nhand, Roger's got a lot of stuff that I never saw anywhere else.\nHowever, I don't see that it has anything to do with the fix we're in\nright now--but at that, we might be worse off. We're still breathing\nair, you notice, and if they don't blanket my wave I can still talk.\"\n\nHe put both hands into his pockets and spoke.\n\n\"Samms? Costigan. Put me on a recorder, quick--I probably haven't got\nmuch time,\" and for ten minutes he talked, concisely and as rapidly as\nhe could utter words, reporting clearly and exactly everything that had\ntranspired. Suddenly he broke off, writhing in agony. Frantically he\ntore his shirt open and hurled a tiny object across the room.\n\n\"Wow!\" he exclaimed. \"They may be deaf, but they can certainly detect an\nultra-wave, and what an interference they can set up on it! No, I'm not\nhurt,\" he reassured the anxious girl, now at his side, \"but it's a good\nthing I had you out of circuit--it would have jolted you loose from six\nor seven of your back teeth.\"\n\n\"Have you any idea where they're taking us?\" she asked soberly.\n\n\"No,\" he answered flatly, looking deep into her steadfast eyes. \"No use\nlying to you--if I know you at all you'd rather take it standing up.\nThat talk of Jovians or Neptunians is the bunk--nothing like that ever\ngrew in our Solarian system. All the signs say that we're going for a\nlong ride.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11\n\nNEVIAN STRIFE\n\n\nThe Nevian space-ship was hurtling upon its way. Space-navigators both,\nthe two Terrestrial officers soon discovered that it was even then\nmoving with a velocity far above that of light and that it must be\naccelerating at a high rate, even though to them it seemed\nstationary--they could feel only a gravitational force somewhat less\nthan that of their native Earth.\n\nBradley, seasoned old campaigner that he was, had retired promptly as\nsoon as he had completed a series of observations, and was sleeping\nsoundly upon a pile of cushions in the first of the three\ninter-connecting rooms. In the middle room, which was to be Clio's,\nCostigan was standing very close to the girl, but was not touching her.\nHis body was rigid, his face was tense and drawn.\n\n\"You are wrong, Conway; all wrong,\" Clio was saying, very seriously. \"I\nknow how you feel, but it's false chivalry.\"\n\n\"That isn't it, at all,\" he insisted, stubbornly. \"It isn't only that\nI've got you out here in space, in danger and alone, that's stopping me.\nI know you and I know myself well enough to know that what we start now\nwe'll go through with for life. It doesn't make any difference, that\nway, whether I start making love to you now or whether I wait until\nwe're back on Tellus; but I'm telling you that for your own good you'd\nbetter pass me up entirely. I've got enough horsepower to keep away from\nyou if you tell me to--not otherwise.\"\n\n\"I know it, both ways, dear, but....\"\n\n\"But nothing!\" he interrupted. \"Can't you get it into your skull what\nyou'll be letting yourself in for if you marry me? Assume that we get\nback, which isn't sure, by any means. But even if we do, some day--and\nmaybe soon, too, you can't tell--somebody is going to collect fifty\ngrams of radium for my head.\"\n\n\"Fifty grams--and everybody knows that Samms himself is rated at only\nsixty? I _knew_ that you were somebody, Conway!\" Clio exclaimed,\nundeterred. \"But at that, something tells me that any pirate will earn\neven that much reward several times over before he collects it. Don't be\nsilly, my dear--goodnight.\"\n\nShe tipped her head back, holding up to him her red, sweetly curved,\nsmiling lips, and his arms swept around her. Her arms went up around his\nneck and they stood, clasped together in the motionless ecstasy of\nlove's first embrace.\n\n\"Girl, girl, how I love you!\" Costigan's voice was husky, his usually\nhard eyes were glowing with a tender light. \"That settles that. I'll\nreally _live_ now, anyway, while....\"\n\n\"Stop it!\" she commanded, sharply. \"You're going to live until you die\nof old age--see if you don't. You'll simply _have_ to, Conway!\"\n\n\"That's so, too--no percentage in dying now. All the pirates between\nTellus and Andromeda couldn't take me after this--I've got too much to\nlive for. Well, goodnight, sweetheart, I'd better beat it--you need some\nsleep.\"\n\nThe lovers' parting was not as simple and straightforward a procedure as\nCostigan's speech would indicate, but finally he did seek his own room\nand relaxed upon a pile of cushions, his stern visage transformed.\nInstead of the low metal ceiling he saw a beautiful, oval, tanned young\nface, framed in a golden-blonde corona of hair. His gaze sank into the\ndepths of loyal, honest, dark blue eyes; and looking deeper and deeper\ninto those blue wells he fell asleep. Upon his face, too set and grim by\nfar for a man of his years--the lives of Sector Chiefs of the\nTriplanetary Service were not easy, nor as a rule were they long--there\nlingered as he slept that newly-acquired softness of expression, the\nreflection of his transcendent happiness.\n\nFor eight hours he slept soundly, as was his wont, then, also according\nto his habit and training he came wide awake, with no intermediate stage\nof napping.\n\n\"Clio?\" he whispered. \"Awake, girl?\"\n\n\"Awake!\" her voice come through the ultra phone, relief in every\nsyllable. \"Good heavens, I thought you were going to sleep until we got\nto wherever it is that we're going! Come on in, you two--I don't see how\nyou can possibly sleep, just as though you were home in bed.\"\n\n\"You've got to learn to sleep anywhere if you expect to keep in....\"\nCostigan broke off as he opened the door and saw Clio's wan face. She\nhad evidently spent a sleepless and wracking eight hours. \"Good Lord,\nClio, why didn't you call me?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm all right, except for being a little jittery. No need of asking\nhow _you_ feel, is there?\"\n\n\"No--I feel hungry,\" he answered cheerfully. \"I'm going to see what we\ncan do about it--or say, guess I'll see whether they're still\ninterfering on Samms' wave.\"\n\nHe took out the small, insulated case and touched the contact stud\nlightly with his finger. His arm jerked away powerfully.\n\n\"Still at it,\" he gave the unnecessary explanation. \"They don't seem to\nwant us to talk outside, but his interference is as good as my\ntalking--they can trace it, of course. Now I'll see what I can find out\nabout our breakfast.\"\n\nHe stepped over to the plate and shot its projector beam forward into\nthe control room, where he saw Nerado lying, doglike, at his instrument\npanel. As Costigan's beam entered the room a blue light flashed on and\nthe Nevian turned an eye and an arm toward his own small observation\nplate. Knowing that they were now in visual communication, Costigan\nbeckoned an invitation and pointed to his mouth in what he hoped was the\nuniversal sign of hunger. The Nevian waved an arm and fingered controls,\nand as he did so a wide section of the floor of Clio's room slid aside.\nThe opening thus made revealed a table which rose upon its low pedestal,\na table equipped with three softly-cushioned benches and spread with a\nglittering array of silver and glassware.\n\nBowls and platters of a dazzlingly white metal, narrow-waisted goblets\nof sheerest crystal; all were hexagonal, beautifully and intricately\ncarved or etched in apparently conventional marine designs. And the\ntable utensils of this strange race were peculiar indeed. There were\ntearing forceps of sixteen needle-sharp curved teeth; there were\nflexible spatulas; there were deep and shallow ladles with flexible\nedges; there were many other peculiarly-curved instruments at whose uses\nthe Terrestrials could not even guess; all having delicately-fashioned\nhandles to fit the long slender fingers of the Nevians.\n\nBut if the table and its appointments were surprising to the\nTerrestrials, revealing as they did a degree of culture which none of\nthem had expected to find in a race of beings so monstrous, the food was\neven more surprising, although in another sense. For the wonderful\ncrystal goblets were filled with a grayish-green slime of a nauseous and\nover-powering odor, the smaller bowls were full of living sea spiders\nand other such delicacies; and each large platter contained a fish fully\na foot long, raw and whole, garnished tastefully with red, purple, and\ngreen strands of seaweed!\n\nClio looked once, then gasped, shutting her eyes and turning away from\nthe table, but Costigan flipped the three fish into a platter and set it\naside before he turned back to the visiplate.\n\n\"They'll go good fried,\" he remarked to Bradley, signaling vigorously to\nNerado that the meal was not acceptable and that he wanted to talk to\nhim, _in person_. Finally he made himself clear, the table sank down out\nof sight, and the Nevian commander cautiously entered the room.\n\nAt Costigan's insistence, he came up to the visiplate, leaving near the\ndoor three alert and fully-armed guards. The man then shot the beam into\nthe galley of the pirate's lifeboat, suggesting that they should be\nallowed to live there. For some time the argument of arms and fingers\nraged--though not exactly fluent conversation, both sides managed to\nconvey their meanings quite clearly. Nerado would not allow the\nTerrestrials to visit their own ship--he was taking no chances--but\nafter a thorough ultra-ray inspection he did finally order some of his\nmen to bring into the middle room the electric range and a supply of\nTerrestrial food. Soon the Nevian fish were sizzling in a pan and the\nappetizing odors of coffee and browning biscuit permeated the room. But\nat the first appearance of those odors the Nevians departed hastily,\ncontent to watch the remainder of the curious and repulsive procedure in\ntheir visiray plates.\n\nBreakfast over and everything made tidy and ship-shape, Costigan turned\nto Clio.\n\n\"Look here, girl; you've got to learn how to sleep. You're all in. Your\neyes look like you've been on a Martian picnic and you didn't eat half\nenough breakfast. You've got to sleep and eat to keep fit. We don't\nwant you passing out on us, so I'll put out this light, and you'll lie\ndown here and sleep until noon.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, don't bother. I'll sleep tonight. I'm quite....\"\n\n\"You'll sleep now,\" he informed her, levelly. \"I never thought of you\nbeing nervous, with Bradley and me on each side of you. We're both right\nhere now, though, and we'll stay here. We'll watch over you like a\ncouple of old hens with one chick between them. Come on; lie down and go\nbye-bye.\"\n\nClio laughed at the simile, but lay down obediently. Costigan sat upon\nthe edge of the great divan holding her hand, and they chatted idly. The\nsilences grew longer, Clio's remarks became fewer, and soon her\nlong-lashed eyelids fell and her deep, regular breathing showed that she\nwas sound asleep. The man stared at her, his very heart in his eyes. So\nyoung, so beautiful, so lovely--and _how_ he did love her! He was not\nformally religious, but his every thought was a prayer. If he could only\nget her out of this mess ... he wasn't fit to live on the same planet\nwith her, but ... just give him one chance, God ... just one!\n\nBut Costigan had been laboring for days under a terrific strain, and had\nbeen going very short on sleep. Half hypnotized by his own mixed\nemotions and by his staring at the smooth curves of Clio's cheek, his\nown eyes closed and, still holding her hand, he sank down into the soft\ncushions beside her and into oblivion.\n\nThus sleeping hand in hand like two children Bradley found them, and a\ntender, fatherly expression came over his face as he looked down at\nthem.\n\n\"Nice little girl, Clio,\" he mused, \"and when they made Costigan they\nbroke the mold. They'll do--about as fine a couple of kids as old Tellus\never produced. I could do with some more sleep myself.\" He yawned\nprodigiously, lay down at Clio's left, and in minutes was himself\nasleep.\n\nHours later, both men were awakened by a merry peal of laughter. Clio\nwas sitting up, regarding them with sparkling eyes. She was refreshed,\nbuoyant, ravenously hungry and highly amused. Costigan was amazed and\nannoyed at what he considered a failure in a self-appointed task;\nBradley was calm and matter-of-fact.\n\n\"Thanks for being such a nice body-guard, you two.\" Clio laughed again,\nbut sobered quickly. \"I slept wonderfully well, but I wonder if I can\nsleep tonight without making you hold my hand all night?\"\n\n\"Oh, he doesn't mind doing that,\" Bradley commented.\n\n\"Mind it!\" Costigan exclaimed, and his eyes and his tone spoke volumes.\n\nThey prepared and ate another meal, one to which Clio did full justice.\nRested and refreshed, they had begun to discuss possibilities of escape\nwhen Nerado and his three armed guards entered the room. The Nevian\nscientist placed a box upon a table and began to make adjustments upon\nits panels, eyeing the Terrestrials attentively after each setting.\nAfter a time a staccato burst of articulate speech issued from the box,\nand Costigan saw a great light.\n\n\"You've got it--hold it!\" he exclaimed, waving his arms excitedly. \"You\nsee, Clio, their voices are pitched either higher or lower than\nours--probably higher--and they've built an audio-frequency changer.\nHe's nobody's fool, that lizard!\"\n\nNerado heard Costigan's voice, there was no doubt of that. His long neck\nlooped and twisted in Nevian gratification; and although neither side\ncould understand the other, both knew that intelligent speech and\nhearing were attributes common to the two races. This fact altered\nmarkedly the relations between captors and captives. The Nevians\nadmitted among themselves that the strange bipeds might be quite\nintelligent, after all; and the Terrestrials at once became more\nhopeful.\n\n\"It isn't so bad, if they can talk,\" Costigan summed up the situation.\n\"We might as well take it easy and make the best of it, particularly\nsince we haven't been able to figure out any possible way of getting\naway from them. They can talk and hear, and we can learn their language\nin time. Maybe we can make some kind of a deal with them to take us back\nto our own system, if we can't make a break.\"\n\nThe Nevians being as eager as the Terrestrials to establish\ncommunication, Nerado kept the newly devised frequency changer in\nconstant use. There is no need of describing at length the details of\nthat interchange of languages. Suffice it to say that starting at the\nvery bottom they learned as babies learn, but with the great advantage\nover babies of possessing fully developed and capable brains. And while\nthe human beings were learning the tongue of Nevia, several of the\namphibians (and incidentally Clio Marsden) were learning Triplanetarian;\nthe two officers knowing well that it would be much easier for the\nNevians to learn the logically-built common language of the Three\nPlanets than to master the senseless intricacies of English.\n\nIn a short time the two parties were able to understand each other after\na fashion, by using a weird mixture of both languages. As soon as a few\nideas had been exchanged, the Nevian scientists built transformers small\nenough to be worn collar-like by the Terrestrials, and the captives were\nallowed to roam at will throughout the great vessel; only the\ncompartment in which was stored the dismembered pirate lifeboat being\nsealed to them. Thus it was that they were not left long in doubt when\nanother fish-shaped cruiser of the void was revealed upon their lookout\nplates in the awful emptiness of interstellar space.\n\n\"This is our sister-ship going to your Solarian system for a cargo of\nthe iron which is so plentiful there,\" Nerado explained to his\ninvoluntary guests.\n\n\"I hope the gang has got the bugs worked out of our super-ship!\"\nCostigan muttered savagely to his companions as Nerado turned away. \"If\nthey have, that outfit will get something more than a load of iron when\nthey get there!\"\n\nMore time passed, during which a blue-white star separated itself from\nthe infinitely distant firmament and began to show a perceptible disk.\nLarger and larger it grew, becoming bluer and bluer as the flying\nspace-ship approached it, until finally Nevia could be seen, apparently\nclose beside her parent orb.\n\nHeavily laden though the vessel was, such was her power that she was\nsoon dropping vertically downward toward a large lagoon in the middle of\nthe Nevian city. That bit of open water was devoid of life, for this was\nto be no ordinary landing. Under the terrific power of the beams braking\nthe descent of that unimaginable load of allotropic iron the water\nseethed and boiled; and instead of floating gracefully upon the surface\nof the sea, this time the huge ship of space sank like a plummet to the\nbottom. Having accomplished the delicate feat of docking the vessel\nsafely in the immense cradle prepared for her, Nerado turned to the\nTellurians, who, now under guard, had been brought before him.\n\n\"While our cargo of iron is being discharged, I am to take you three\nspecimens to the College of Science, where you are to undergo a thorough\nphysical and psychological examination. Follow me.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute!\" protested Costigan, with a quick and furtive wink at\nhis companions. \"Do you expect us to go through _water_, and at this\nfrightful depth?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied the Nevian, in surprise. \"You are air-breathers, of\ncourse, but you must be able to swim a little, and this slight\ndepth--but little more than thirty of your meters--will not trouble\nyou.\"\n\n\"You are wrong, twice,\" declared the Terrestrial, convincingly. \"If by\n'swimming' you mean propelling yourself in or through the water, we know\nnothing of it. In water over our heads we drown helplessly in a minute\nor two, and the pressure at this depth would kill us instantly.\"\n\n\"Well, I could take a lifeboat, of course, but that ...\" the Nevian\nCaptain began, doubtfully, but broke off at the sound of a staccato call\nfrom his signal panel.\n\n\"Captain Nerado, attention!\"\n\n\"Nerado,\" he acknowledged into a microphone.\n\n\"The Third City is being attacked by the fishes of the greater deeps.\nThey have developed new and powerful mobile fortresses mounting\nunheard-of weapons and the city reports that it cannot long withstand\ntheir attack. They are asking for all possible help. Your vessel not\nonly has vast stores of iron, but also mounts weapons of power. You are\nrequested to proceed to their aid at the earliest possible moment.\"\n\nNerado snapped out orders and the liquid iron fell in streams from\nwide-open ports, forming a vast, red pool in the bottom of the dock. In\na short time the great vessel was in equilibrium with the water she\ndisplaced, and as soon as she had attained a slight buoyancy the ports\nsnapped shut and Nerado threw on the power.\n\n\"Go back to your own quarters and stay there until I send for you,\" the\nNevian directed, and as the Terrestrials obeyed the curt orders the\ncruiser tore herself from the water and flashed up into the crimson sky.\n\n\"What a barefaced liar!\" Bradley exclaimed. The three, transformers cut\noff, were back in the middle room of their suite. \"You can outswim an\notter, and I happen to know that you came up out of the old DZ83 from a\ndepth of....\"\n\n\"Maybe I did exaggerate a trifle,\" Costigan interrupted, \"but the more\nhelpless he thinks we are the better for us. And we want to stay out of\nany of their cities as long as we can, because they may be hard places\nto get out of. I've got a couple of ideas, but they aren't ripe enough\nto pick yet.... Wow! How this bird's been traveling! We're there\nalready! If he hits the water going like this, he'll split himself,\nsure!\"\n\nWith undiminished velocity they were flashing downward in a long slant\ntoward the beleaguered Third City, and from the flying vessel there was\nlaunched toward the city's central lagoon a torpedo. No missile this,\nbut a capsule containing a full ton of allotropic iron, which would be\nof more use to the Nevian defenders than millions of men. For the Third\nCity was sore pressed indeed. Around it was one unbroken ring of\nboiling, exploding water--water billowing upward in searing, blinding\nbursts of super-heated steam, or being hurled bodily in all directions\nin solid masses by the cataclysmic forces being released by the\nembattled fishes of the greater deeps. Her outer defenses were already\ndown, and even as the Terrestrials stared in amazement another of the\nimmense hexagonal buildings burst into fragments; its upper structure\nflying wildly into scrap metal, its lower half subsiding drunkenly below\nthe surface of the boiling sea.\n\nThe three Earth-people seized whatever supports were at hand as the\nNevian space-ship struck the water with undiminished speed, but the\nprecaution was needless--Nerado knew thoroughly his vessel, its strength\nand its capabilities. There was a mighty splash, but that was all. The\nartificial gravity was unchanged by the impact; to the passengers the\nvessel was still motionless and on even keel as, now a submarine, she\nsnapped around like a very fish and attacked the rear of the nearest\nfortress.\n\nFor fortresses they were; vast structures of green metal, plowing\nforward implacably upon immense caterpillar treads. And as they crawled\nthey destroyed, and Costigan, exploring the strange submarine with his\nvisiray beam, watched and marveled. For the fortresses were full of\nwater; water artificially cooled and aerated, entirely separate from the\nboiling flood through which they moved. They were manned by fish some\nfive feet in length. Fish with huge, goggling eyes; fish plentifully\nequipped with long, armlike tentacles; fish poised before control panels\nor darting about intent upon their various duties. Fish with brains,\nwaging war!\n\nNor was their warfare ineffectual. Their heat-rays boiled the water for\nhundreds of yards before them and their torpedoes were exploding against\nthe Nevian defenses in one appallingly continuous concussion. But most\npotent of all was a weapon unknown to Triplanetary warfare. From a\nfortress there would shoot out, with the speed of a meteor, a long,\njointed, telescopic rod; tipped with a tiny, brilliantly-shining ball.\nWhenever that glowing tip encountered any obstacle, that obstacle\ndisappeared in an explosion world-wracking in its intensity. Then what\nwas left of the rod, dark now, would be retracted into the fortress-only\nto emerge again in a moment with a tip once more shining and potent.\n\nNerado, apparently as unfamiliar with the peculiar weapon as were the\nTerrestrials, attacked cautiously; sending out far to the fore his\nmurkily impenetrable screens of red. But the submarine was entirely\nnon-ferrous, and its officers were apparently quite familiar with Nevian\nbeams which licked at and clung to the green walls in impotent fury.\nThrough the red veil came stabbing ball after ball, and only the most\nfrantic dodging saved the space-ship from destruction in those first few\nfurious seconds. And now the Nevian defenders of the Third City had\nsecured and were employing the vast store of allotropic iron so\nopportunely delivered by Nerado.\n\nFrom the city there pushed out immense nets of metal, extending from the\nsurface of the ocean to its bottom; nets radiating such terrific forces\nthat the very water itself was beaten back and stood motionless in\nvertical, glassy walls. Torpedoes were futile against that wall of\nenergy. The most fiercely driven rays of the fishes flamed incandescent\nagainst it, in vain. Even the incredible violence of a concentration of\nevery available force-ball against one point could not break through. At\nthat unimaginable explosion water was hurled for miles. The bed of the\nocean was not only exposed, but in it there was blown a crater at whose\ndimensions the Terrestrials dared not even guess. The crawling\nfortresses themselves were thrown backward violently and the very world\nwas rocked to its core by the concussion, but that iron-driven wall\nheld. The massive nets swayed and gave back, and tidal waves hurled\ntheir mountainously destructive masses through the Third City, but the\nmighty barrier remained intact. And Nerado, still attacking two of the\npowerful tanks with his every weapon, was still dodging those flashing\nballs charged with the quintessence of destruction. The fishes could not\nsee through the sub-ethereal veil, but all the gunners of the two\nfortresses were combing it thoroughly with ever-lengthening,\never-thrusting rods, in a desperate attempt to wipe out the new and\napparently all-powerful Nevian submarine whose sheer power was slowly\nbut inexorably crushing even their gigantic walls.\n\n\"Well, I think that right now's the best chance we'll ever have of doing\nsomething for ourselves.\" Costigan turned away from the absorbing scenes\npictured upon the visiplate and faced his two companions.\n\n\"But what can we possibly do?\" asked Clio.\n\n\"Whatever it is, we'll try it!\" Bradley exclaimed.\n\n\"Anything's better than staying here and letting them analyze us--no\ntelling what they'd do to us,\" Costigan went on.\n\n\"I know a lot more about things than they think I do. They never did\ncatch me using my spy-ray--it's on an awfully narrow beam, you know, and\nuses almost no power at all--so I've been able to dope out quite a lot\nof stuff. I can open most of their locks, and I know how to run their\nsmall boats. This battle, fantastic as it is, is deadly stuff, and it\nisn't one-sided, by any means, either, so that every one of them, from\nNerado down, seems to be on emergency duty. There are no guards watching\nus, or stationed where we want to go--our way out is open. And once out,\nthis battle is giving us our best possible chance to get away from them.\nThere's so much emission out there already that they probably couldn't\ndetect the driving force of the lifeboat, and they'll be too busy to\nchase us, anyway.\"\n\n\"Once out, then what?\" asked Bradley.\n\n\"We'll have to decide that before we start, of course. I'd say make a\nbreak back for Earth. We know the direction and we'll have plenty of\npower.\"\n\n\"But good Heavens, Conway, it's so far!\" exclaimed Clio. \"How about\nfood, water, and air--would we ever get there?\"\n\n\"You know as much about that as I do. I think so, but of course anything\nmight happen. This ship is none too big, is considerably slower than the\nbig space-ship, and we're a long ways from home. Another bad thing is\nthe food question. The boat is well stocked according to Nevian ideas,\nbut it's pretty foul stuff for us to eat. However, it's nourishing, and\nwe'll have to eat it, since we can't carry enough of our own supplies to\nthe boat to last long. Even so, we may have to go on short rations, but\nI think that we'll be able to make it. On the other hand, what happens\nif we stay here? They will find us sooner or later, and we don't know\nany too much about these ultra-weapons. We are land-dwellers, and there\nis little if any land on this planet. Then, too, we don't know where to\nlook for what land there may be, and even if we could find it, we know\nthat it is all over-run with amphibians already. There's a lot of things\nthat might be better, but they might be a lot worse, too. How about it?\nDo we try or do we stay here?\"\n\n\"We try it!\" exclaimed Clio and Bradley, as one.\n\n\"All right. I'd better not waste any more time talking--let's go!\"\n\nStepping up to the locked and shielded door, he took out a peculiarly\nbuilt torch and pointed it at the Nevian lock. There was no light, no\nnoise, but the massive portal swung smoothly open. They stepped out and\nCostigan relocked and reshielded the entrance.\n\n\"How ... what....\" Clio demanded.\n\n\"I've been going to school for the last few weeks,\" Costigan grinned,\n\"and I've picked up quite a few things here and there--literally, as\nwell as figuratively. Snap it up, guys! Our armor is stored with the\npieces of the pirates' lifeboat, and I'll feel a lot better when we've\ngot it on and have hold of a few Lewistons.\"\n\nThey hurried down corridors, up ramps, and along hallways, with\nCostigan's spy-ray investigating the course ahead for chance Nevians.\nBradley and Clio were unarmed, but the operative had found a piece of\nflat metal and had ground it to a razor edge.\n\n\"I think I can throw this thing straight enough and fast enough to chop\noff a Nevian's head before he can put a paralyzing ray on us,\" he\nexplained grimly, but he was not called upon to show his skill with the\nimprovised cleaver.\n\nAs he had concluded from his careful survey, every Nevian was at some\ncontrol or weapon, doing his part in that frightful combat with the\ndenizens of the greater deeps. Their path was open; they were neither\nmolested nor detected as they ran toward the compartment within which\nwas sealed all their belongings. The door of that room opened, as had\nthe other, to Costigan's knowing beam; and all three set hastily to\nwork. They made up packs of food, filled their capacious pockets with\nemergency rations, buckled on Lewistons and automatics, donned their\narmor, and clamped into their external holsters a full complement of\nadditional weapons.\n\n\"Now comes the ticklish part of the business,\" Costigan informed the\nothers. His helmet was slowly turning this way and that, and the others\nknew that through his spy-ray goggles he was studying their route.\n\"There's only one boat we stand a chance of reaching, and somebody's\nmighty apt to see us. There's a lot of detectors up there, and we'll\nhave to cross a corridor full of communicator beams. There, that line's\noff--scoot!\"\n\nAt his word they dashed out into the hall and hurried along for minutes,\ndodging sharply to right or left as the leader snapped out orders.\nFinally he stopped.\n\n\"Here's those beams I told you about. We'll have to roll under 'em.\nThey're less than waist high--right there's the lowest one. Watch me do\nit, and when I give you the word, one at a time, you do the same. _Keep\nlow_--don't let an arm or a leg get up into a ray or they may see us.\"\n\nHe threw himself flat, rolled upon the floor a yard or so, and scrambled\nto his feet. He gazed intently at the blank wall for a space.\n\n\"Bradley--now!\" he snapped, and the captain duplicated his performance.\n\nBut Clio, unused to the heavy and cumbersome space-armor she was\nwearing, could not roll in it with any degree of success. When Costigan\nbarked his order she tried, but stopped, floundering almost directly\nbelow the network of invisible beams. As she struggled one mailed arm\nwent up, and Costigan saw in his ultra-goggles the faint flash as the\nbeam encountered the interfering field. But already he had acted.\nCrouching low, he struck down the arm, seized it, and dragged the girl\nout of the zone of visibility. Then in furious haste he opened a nearby\ndoor and all three sprang into a tiny compartment.\n\n\"Shut off all the fields of your suits, so that they can't interfere!\"\nhe hissed into the utter darkness. \"Not that I'd mind killing a few of\nthem, but if they start an organized search we're sunk. But even if they\ndid get a warning by touching your glove, Clio, they probably won't\nsuspect us. Our rooms are still shielded, and the chances are that\nthey're too busy to bother much about us, anyway.\"\n\nHe was right. A few beams darted here and there, but the Nevians saw\nnothing amiss and ascribed the interference to the falling into the beam\nof some chance bit of charged metal. With no further misadventures the\nfugitives gained entrance to the Nevian lifeboat, where Costigan's first\nact was to disconnect one steel boot from his armor of space. With a\nsigh of relief he pulled his foot out of it, and from it carefully\npoured into the small power-tank of the craft fully thirty pounds of\nallotropic iron!\n\n\"I pinched it off them,\" he explained, in answer to amazed and inquiring\nlooks, \"and maybe you don't think it's a relief to get it out of that\nboot! I couldn't steal a flask to carry it in, so this was the only\nplace I could put it. These lifeboats are equipped with only a couple of\ngrams of iron apiece, you know, and we couldn't get half-way back to\nTellus on that, even with smooth going; and we may have to fight. With\nthis much to go on, though, we could go to Andromeda, fighting all the\nway. Well, we'd better break away.\"\n\nCostigan watched his plate closely; and, when the maneuvering of the\ngreat vessel brought his exit port as far away as possible from the\nThird City and the warring tanks, he shot the little cruiser out and\naway. Straight out into the ocean it sped, through the murky red veil,\nand darted upward toward the surface. The three wanderers sat tense,\nhardly daring to breathe, staring into the plates--Clio and Bradley\npushing at mental levers and stepping down hard upon mental brakes in\nunconscious efforts to help Costigan dodge the beams and rods of death\nflashing so appallingly close upon all sides. Out of the water and into\nthe air the darting, dodging lifeboat flashed in safety; but in the air,\nsupposedly free from menace, came disaster. There was a crunching,\ngrating shock and the vessel was thrown into a dizzy spiral, from which\nCostigan finally leveled it into headlong flight away from the scene of\nbattle. Watching the pyrometers which recorded the temperature of the\nouter shell, he drove the lifeboat ahead at the highest safe atmospheric\nspeed while Bradley went to inspect the damage.\n\n\"Pretty bad, but better than I thought,\" the captain reported. \"Outer\nand inner plates broken away on a seam. We wouldn't hold cotton waste,\nlet alone air. Any tools aboard?\"\n\n\"Some--and what we haven't got we'll make,\" Costigan declared. \"We'll\nput a lot of distance behind us, then we'll fix her up and get away from\nhere.\"\n\n\"What are those fish, anyway, Conway?\" Clio asked, as the lifeboat tore\nalong. \"The Nevians are bad enough, Heaven knows, but the very idea of\nintelligent and educated _fish_ is enough to drive one mad!\"\n\n\"You know Nerado mentioned several times the 'semicivilized fishes of\nthe greater deeps'?\" he reminded her. \"I gather that there are at least\nthree intelligent races here. We know two--the Nevians, who are\namphibians, and the fishes of the greater deeps. The fishes of the\nlesser deeps are also intelligent. As I get it, the Nevian cities were\noriginally built in very shallow water, or perhaps were upon islands.\nThe development of machinery and tools gave them a big edge on the fish;\nand those living in the shallow seas, nearest the Islands, gradually\nbecame tributary nations, if not actually slaves. Those fish not only\nserve as food, but work in the mines, hatcheries, and plantations, and\ndo all kinds of work for the Nevians. Those so-called 'lesser deeps'\nwere conquered first, of course, and all their races of fish are docile\nenough now. But the deep-sea breeds, who live in water so deep that the\nNevians can hardly stand the pressure down there, were more intelligent\nto start with, and more stubborn besides. But the most valuable metals\nhere are deep down--this planet is very light for its size, you know--so\nthe Nevians kept at it until they conquered some of the deep-sea fish,\ntoo, and put 'em to work. But those high-pressure boys were nobody's\nfools. They realized that as time went on the amphibians would get\nfurther and further ahead of them in development, so they let themselves\nbe conquered, learned how to use the Nevians' tools and everything else\nthey could get hold of, developed a lot of new stuff of their own, and\nnow they're out to wipe the amphibians off the map completely, before\nthey get too far ahead of them to handle.\"\n\n\"And the Nevians are afraid of them, and want to kill them all, as fast\nas they possibly can,\" guessed Clio.\n\n\"That would be the logical thing, of course,\" commented Bradley. \"Got\npretty nearly enough distance now, Costigan?\"\n\n\"There isn't enough distance on the planet to suit me,\" Costigan\nreplied. \"We'll need all we can get. A full diameter away from that crew\nof amphibians is too close for comfort--their detectors are keen.\"\n\n\"Then they can detect us?\" Clio asked. \"Oh, I wish they hadn't hit\nus--we'd have been away from here long ago.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" Costigan agreed, feelingly. \"But they did--no use squawking.\nWe can rivet and weld those seams, and things could be a lot worse--we\nare still breathing air!\"\n\nIn silence the lifeboat flashed onward, and half of Nevia's mighty globe\nwas traversed before it was brought to a halt. Then in furious haste the\ntwo officers set to work, again to make their small craft sound and\nspaceworthy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12\n\nWORM, SUBMARINE, AND FREEDOM\n\n\nSince both Costigan and Bradley had often watched their captors at work\nduring the long voyage from the Solar System to Nevia, they were quite\nfamiliar with the machine tools of the amphibians. Their stolen\nlifeboat, being an emergency craft, of course carried full repair\nequipment; and to such good purpose did the two officers labor that even\nbefore their air-tanks were fully charged, all the damage had been\nrepaired.\n\nThe lifeboat lay motionless upon the mirror-smooth surface of the ocean.\nCaptain Bradley had opened the upper port and the three stood in the\nopening, gazing in silence toward the incredibly distant horizon, while\npowerful pumps were forcing the last possible ounces of air into the\nstorage cylinders. Mile upon strangely flat mile stretched that\nwaveless, unbroken expanse of water, merging finally into the violent\nredness of the Nevian sky. The sun was setting; a vast ball of purple\nflame dropping rapidly toward the horizon. Darkness came suddenly as\nthat seething ball disappeared, and the air became bitterly cold, in\nsharp contrast to the pleasant warmth of a moment before. And as\nsuddenly clouds appeared in blackly banked masses and a cold, driving\nrain began to beat down.\n\n\"Br-r-r, it's cold! Let's go in--Oh! _Shut the door!_\" Clio shrieked,\nand leaped wildly down into the compartment below, out of Costigan's\nway, for he and Bradley had also seen slithering toward them the\nfrightful arm of the Thing.\n\nAlmost before the girl had spoken Costigan had leaped to the controls,\nand not an instant too soon; for the tip of that horrible tentacle\nflashed into the rapidly narrowing crack just before the door clanged\nshut. As the powerful toggles forced the heavy wedges into engagement\nand drove the massive disk home, that grisly tip fell severed to the\nfloor of the compartment and lay there, twitching and writhing with a\nloathesome and unearthly vigor. Two feet long the piece was, and larger\nthan a strong man's leg. It was armed with spiked and jointed metallic\nscales, and instead of sucking disks it was equipped with a series of\n_mouths_--mouths filled with sharp metallic teeth which gnashed and\nground together furiously, even though sundered from the horrible\norganism which they were designed to feed.\n\nThe little submarine shuddered in every plate and member as monstrous\ncoils encircled her and tightened inexorably in terrific, rippling\nsurges eloquent of mastodonic power; and a strident vibration smote\nsickeningly upon Terrestrial ear-drums as the metal spikes of the\nmonstrosity crunched and ground upon the outer plating of their small\nvessel. Costigan stood unmoved at the plate, watching intently; hands\nready upon the controls. Due to the artificial gravity of the lifeboat\nit seemed perfectly stationary to its occupants. Only the weird\ngyrations of the pictures upon the lookout screens showed that the craft\nwas being shaken and thrown about like a rat in the jaws of a terrier;\nonly the gauges revealed that they were almost a mile below the surface\nof the ocean already, and were still going downward at an appalling\nrate. Finally Clio could stand no more.\n\n\"Aren't you going to do something, Conway?\" she cried.\n\n\"Not unless I have to,\" he replied, composedly. \"I don't believe that\nhe can really hurt us, and if I use force of any kind I'm afraid that it\nwill kick up enough disturbance to bring Nerado down on us like a hawk\nonto a chicken. However, if he takes us much deeper I'll have to go to\nwork on him. We're getting down pretty close to our limit, and the\nbottom's a long ways down yet.\"\n\nDeeper and deeper the lifeboat was dragged by its dreadful opponent,\nwhose spiked teeth still tore savagely at the tough outer plating of the\ncraft, until Costigan reluctantly threw in his power switches. Against\nthe full propellant thrust the monster could draw them no lower, but\nneither could the lifeboat make any headway toward the surface. The\npilot then turned on his beams, but found that they were ineffective. So\nclosely was the creature wrapped around the submarine that his weapons\ncould not be brought to bear upon it.\n\n\"What can it possibly be, anyway, and what can we do about it?\" Clio\nasked.\n\n\"I thought at first it was something like a devilfish, or possibly an\novergrown starfish, but it isn't,\" Costigan made answer. \"It must be a\nkind of flat worm. That doesn't sound reasonable--the thing must be all\nof a hundred meters long--but there it is. The only thing left to do\nthat I can think of is to try to boil him alive.\"\n\nHe closed other circuits, diffusing a terrific beam of pure heat, and\nthe water all about them burst into furious clouds of steam. The boat\nleaped upward as the metallic fins of the gigantic worm fanned vapor\ninstead of water, but the creature neither released its hold nor ceased\nits relentlessly grinding attack. Minute after minute went by, but\nfinally the worm dropped limply away--cooked through and through;\nvanquished only by death.\n\n\"Now we've put our foot in it, clear to the neck!\" Costigan exclaimed,\nas he shot the lifeboat upward at its maximum power. \"Look at that! I\nknew that Nerado could trace us, but I didn't have any idea that _they_\ncould!\"\n\nStaring with Costigan into the plate, Bradley and the girl saw, not the\nNevian sky-rover they had expected, but a fast submarine cruiser, manned\nby the frightful fishes of the greater deeps. It was coming directly\ntoward the lifeboat, and even as Costigan hurled the little vessel off\nat an angle and then sped upward into the air, one of the deadly\noffensive rods, tipped with its glowing ball of pure destruction,\nflashed through the spot where they would have been had they held their\nformer course.\n\nBut powerful as were the propellant forces of the lifeboat and fiercely\nthough Costigan applied them, the denizens of the deep clamped a tractor\nbeam upon the flying vessel before it had gained a mile of altitude.\nCostigan aligned his every driving projector as his vessel came to an\nabrupt halt in the invisible grip of the beam, then experimented with\nvarious dials.\n\n\"There ought to be some way of cutting that beam,\" he pondered audibly,\n\"but I don't know enough about their system to do it, and I'm afraid to\nmonkey around with things too much, because I might accidentally release\nthe screens we've already got out, and they're stopping altogether too\nmuch stuff for us to do without them right now.\"\n\nHe frowned as he studied the flaring defensive screens, now radiating an\nincandescent violet under the concentration of forces being hurled\nagainst them by the warlike fishes, then stiffened suddenly.\n\n\"I thought so--they _can_ shoot 'em!\" he exclaimed, throwing the\nlifeboat into a furious corkscrew turn, and the very air blazed into\nflaming splendor as a dazzlingly scintillating ball of energy sped past\nthem and high into the air beyond.\n\nThen for minutes a spectacular battle raged. The twisting, turning,\nleaping airship, small as she was and agile, kept on eluding the\nexplosive projectiles of the fishes, and her screens neutralized and\nre-radiated the full power of the attacking beams. More--since Costigan\ndid not need to think of sparing his iron, the ocean around the great\nsubmarine began furiously to boil under the full-driven offensive beams\nof the tiny Nevian ship. But escape Costigan could not. He could not cut\nthat tractor beam and the utmost power of his drivers could not wrest\nthe lifeboat from its tenacious clutch. And slowly but inexorably the\nship of space was being drawn downward toward the ship of ocean's\ndepths. Downward, in spite of the utmost possible effort of every\nprojector and generator; and Clio and Bradley, sick at heart, looked\nonce at each other. Then they looked at Costigan, who, jaw hard set and\neyes unflinchingly upon his plate, was concentrating his attack upon one\nturret of the green monster as they settled lower and lower.\n\n\"If this is ... if our number is going up, Conway,\" Clio began,\nunsteadily.\n\n\"Not yet, it isn't!\" he snapped. \"Keep a stiff upper lip, girl. We're\nstill breathing air, and the battle's not over yet!\"\n\nNor was it; but it was not Costigan's efforts, mighty though they were,\nthat ended the attack of the fishes of the greater deeps. The tractor\nbeams snapped without warning, and so prodigious were the forces being\nexerted by the lifeboat that as it hurled itself away the three\npassengers were thrown violently to the floor, in spite of the powerful\ngravity controls. Scrambling up on hands and knees, bracing himself as\nbest he could against the terrific forces, Costigan managed finally to\nforce a hand up to his panel. He was barely in time; for even as he cut\nthe driving power to its normal value the outer shell of the lifeboat\nwas blazing at white heat from the friction of the atmosphere through\nwhich it had been tearing with such an insane acceleration!\n\n\"Oh, I see--Nerado to the rescue,\" Costigan commented, after a glance\ninto the plate. \"I hope that those fish blow him clear out of the\nGalaxy!\"\n\n\"Why?\" demanded Clio. \"I should think that you'd....\"\n\n\"Think again,\" he advised her. \"The worse Nerado gets licked the better\nfor us. I don't really expect that, but if they can keep him busy long\nenough, we can get far enough away so that he won't bother about us any\nmore.\"\n\nAs the lifeboat tore upward through the air at the highest permissible\natmospheric velocity Bradley and Clio peered over Costigan's shoulders\ninto the plate, watching in fascinated interest the scene which was\nbeing kept in focus upon it. The Nevian ship of space was plunging\ndownward in a long, slanting dive, her terrific beams of force screaming\nout ahead of her. The beams of the little lifeboat had boiled the waters\nof the ocean; those of the parent craft seemed literally to blast them\nout of existence. All about the green submarine there had been volumes\nof furiously-boiling water and dense clouds of vapor; now water and fog\nalike disappeared, converted into transparent super-heated steam by the\nblasts of Nevian energy. Through that tenuous gas the enormous mass of\nthe submarine fell like a plummet, her defensive screens flaming an\nalmost invisible violet, her every offensive weapon vomiting forth solid\nand vibratory destruction toward the Nevian cruiser so high in the\nangry, scarlet heavens.\n\nFor miles the submarine dropped, until the frightful pressure of the\ndepth drove water into Nerado's beam faster than his forces could\nvolatilize it. Then in that seething funnel there was waged a starkly\nfantastic conflict. At its wildly turbulent bottom lay the submarine,\nnow apparently trying to escape, but held fast by the tractors of the\nspace-ship; at its top, smothered almost to the point of invisibility by\nbillowing masses of steam, hung poised the Nevian cruiser.\n\nAs the atmosphere had grown thinner and thinner with increasing\naltitude Costigan had regulated his velocity accordingly, keeping the\nouter shell of the vessel at the highest temperature consistent with\nsafety. Now beyond measurable atmospheric pressure, the shell cooled\nrapidly and he applied full touring acceleration. At an appalling and\nconstantly increasing speed the miniature space-ship shot away from the\nstrange, red planet; and smaller and smaller upon the plate became its\npicture. The great vessel of the void had long since plunged beneath the\nsurface of the sea, to come more closely to grips with the vessel of the\nfishes; for a long time nothing of the battle had been visible save\nimmense clouds of steam, blanketing hundreds of square miles of the\nocean's surface. But just before the picture became too small to reveal\ndetails a few tiny dark spots appeared above the banks of cloud, now\nbrilliantly illuminated by the rays of the rising sun--dots which might\nhave been fragments of either vessel, blown bodily from the depths of\nthe ocean and, riven asunder, hurled high into the air by the incredible\nforces at the command of the other.\n\nNevia a tiny moon and the fierce blue sun rapidly growing smaller in the\ndistance, Costigan swung his visiray beam into the line of travel and\nturned to his companions.\n\n\"Well, we're off,\" he said, scowling. \"I hope it was Nerado that got\nblown up back there, but I'm afraid it wasn't. He whipped two of those\nsubmarines that we know of, and probably half their fleet besides.\nThere's no particular reason why that one should be able to take him, so\nit's my idea that we should get ready for great gobs of trouble. They'll\nchase us, of course; and I'm afraid that with their power, they'll catch\nus.\"\n\n\"But what can we do, Conway?\" asked Clio.\n\n\"Several things,\" he grinned. \"I managed to get quite a lot of dope on\nthat paralyzing ray and some of their other stuff, and we can install\nthe necessary equipment in our suits easily enough.\"\n\nThey removed their armor, and Costigan explained in detail the changes\nwhich must be made in the Triplanetary field generators. All three set\nvigorously to work--the two officers deftly and surely; Clio uncertainly\nand with many questions, but with undaunted spirit. Finally, having done\neverything they could do to strengthen their position, they settled down\nto the watchful routine of the flight, with every possible instrument\nset to detect any sign of the pursuit they so feared.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13\n\nTHE HILL\n\n\nThe heavy cruiser Chicago hung motionless in space, thousands of miles\ndistant from the warring fleets of space-ships so viciously attacking\nand so stubbornly defending Roger's planetoid. In the captain's sanctum\nLyman Cleveland crouched tensely above his ultracameras, his sensitive\nfingers touching lightly their micrometric dials. His body was rigid,\nhis face was set and drawn. Only his eyes moved; flashing back and forth\nbetween his instruments and the smoothly-running strands of spring-steel\nwire upon which were being recorded the frightful scenes of carnage and\ndestruction.\n\nSilent and bitterly absorbed, though surrounded by staring officers\nwhose fervent, almost unconscious cursing was prayerful in its\nintensity, the visiray expert kept his ultra-instruments upon that awful\nstruggle to its dire conclusion. Flawlessly those instruments noted\nevery detail of the destruction of Roger's fleet, of the transformation\nof the armada of Triplanetary into an unknown fluid, and finally of the\ndissolution of the gigantic planetoid itself. Then furiously Cleveland\ndrove his beam against the crimsonly opaque obscurity into which the\npeculiar, viscous stream of substance was disappearing. Time after time\nhe applied his every watt of power, with no result. A vast volume of\nspace, roughly ellipsoidal in shape, was closed to him by forces\nentirely beyond his experience or comprehension. But suddenly, while his\nrays were still trying to pierce that impenetrable murk, it disappeared\ninstantly and without warning: the illimitable infinity of space once\nmore lay revealed upon his plates and his beams flashed unimpeded\nthrough the void.\n\n\"Back to Tellus, sir?\" The _Chicago's_ captain broke the strained\nsilence.\n\n\"I wouldn't say so, if I had the say.\" Cleveland, baffled and\nfrustrated, straightened up and shut off his cameras. \"We should report\nback as soon as possible, of course, but there seems to be a lot of\nwreckage out there yet that we can't photograph in detail at this\ndistance. A close study of it might help us a lot in understanding what\nthey did and how they did it. I'd say that we should get close-ups of\nwhatever is left, and do it right away, before it gets scattered all\nover space; but of course I can't give you orders.\"\n\n\"You can, though,\" the captain made surprising answer. \"My orders are\nthat you are in command of this vessel.\"\n\n\"In that case we will proceed at full emergency acceleration to\ninvestigate the wreckage,\" Cleveland replied, and the cruiser--sole\nsurvivor of Triplanetary's supposedly invincible force--shot away with\nevery projector delivering its maximum blast.\n\nAs the scene of the disaster was approached there was revealed upon the\nplates a confused mass of debris; a mass whose individual units were\napparently moving at random, yet which was as a whole still following\nthe orbit of Roger's planetoid. Space was full of machine parts,\nstructural members, furniture, flotsam of all kinds; and everywhere were\nthe bodies of men. Some were encased in space-suits, and it was to these\nthat the rescuers turned first--space-hardened veterans though the men\nof the _Chicago_ were, they did not care even to look at the others.\nStrangely enough, however, not one of the floating figures spoke or\nmoved, and space-line men were hurriedly sent out to investigate.\n\n\"All dead.\" Quickly the dread report came back. \"Been dead a long time.\nThe armor is all stripped off the suits, and all the generators and\nother apparatus are all shot. Something funny about it, too--none of\nthem seem to have been touched, but the machinery of the suits seems to\nbe about half missing.\"\n\n\"I've got it all on the reels, sir.\" Cleveland, his close-up survey of\nthe wreckage finished, turned to the captain. \"What they've just\nreported checks up with what I have photographed everywhere. I've got an\nidea of what might have happened, but it's so new that I'll have to have\nsome evidence before I'll believe it myself. You might have them bring\nin a few of the armored bodies, a couple of those switchboards and\npanels floating around out there, and half a dozen miscellaneous pieces\nof junk--the nearest things they get hold of, whatever they happen to\nbe.\"\n\n\"Then back to Tellus at maximum?\"\n\n\"Right--back to Tellus, as fast as we can possibly get there.\"\n\nWhile the _Chicago_ hurtled through space at full power, Cleveland and\nthe ranking officers of the vessel grouped themselves about the salvaged\nwreckage. Familiar with space-wrecks as were they all, none of them had\never seen anything like the material before them. For every part and\ninstrument was weirdly and meaninglessly disintegrated. There were no\nbreaks, no marks of violence, and yet nothing was intact. Bolt-holes\nstared empty, cores, shielding cases and needles had disappeared, the\nvital parts of every instrument hung awry, disorganization reigned\nrampant and supreme.\n\n\"I never imagined such a mess,\" the captain said, after a long and\nsilent study of the objects. \"If you have a theory to cover _that_,\nCleveland, I would like to hear it!\"\n\n\"I want you to notice something first,\" the expert replied. \"But don't\nlook for what's there--look for what _isn't_ there.\"\n\n\"Well, the armor is gone. So are the shielding cases, shafts, spindles,\nthe housings and stems ...\" the captain's voice died away as his eyes\nraced over the collection. \"Why everything that was made of wood,\nbakelite, copper, aluminum, silver, bronze, or anything but steel hasn't\nbeen touched, and every bit of that is gone. But that doesn't make\nsense--what does it mean?\"\n\n\"I don't know--yet,\" Cleveland replied, slowly. \"But I'm afraid that\nthere's more, and worse.\" He opened a space-suit reverently, revealing\nthe face; a face calm and peaceful, but utterly, sickeningly white.\nStill reverently, he made a deep incision in the brawny neck, severing\nthe jugular vein, then went on, soberly:\n\n\"You never imagined such a thing as _white_ blood, either, but it all\nchecks up. Someway, somehow, every atom of free or combined iron in this\nwhole volume of space was made off with.\"\n\n\"Huh? How come? And above all, _why_?\" from the amazed and staring\nofficers.\n\n\"You know as much as I do,\" grimly, ponderingly. \"If it were not for the\nfact that there are solid asteroids of iron out beyond Mars, I would say\nthat somebody wanted iron badly enough to wipe out the fleet and the\nplanetoid to get it. But anyway, whoever they were, they carried enough\npower so that our armament didn't bother them at all. They simply took\nthe metal they wanted and went away with it--so fast that I couldn't\ntrace them with an ultra-beam. There's only one thing plain; but that's\nso plain that it scares me stiff. This whole affair spells intelligence,\nwith a capital 'I', and that intelligence is anything but friendly. I\nwant to put Fred Rodebush at work on this just as fast as I can get\nhim.\"\n\nHe stepped over to his ultra-projector and put in a call for Virgil\nSamms, whose face soon appeared upon his screen.\n\n\"We got it all, Virgil,\" he reported. \"It's something\nextraordinary--bigger, wider, and deeper than any of us dreamed. It may\nbe urgent, too, so I think I had better shoot the stuff in on an\nultra-beam and save some time. Fred has a telemagneto recorder there\nthat he can synchronize with this outfit easily enough. Right?\"\n\n\"Right. Good work, Lyman--thanks,\" came back terse approval and\nappreciation, and soon the steel wires were again flashing from reel to\nreel. This time, however, their varying magnetic charges were so\nmodulating ultra-waves that every detail of that calamitous battle of\nthe void was being screened and recorded in the innermost private\nlaboratory of the Triplanetary Service.\n\nEager though he naturally was to join his fellow-scientists, Cleveland\nwas not impatient during the long, but uneventful journey back to Earth.\nThere was much to study, many improvements to be made in his\ncomparatively crude first ultra-camera. Then, too, there were long\nconferences with Samms, and particularly with Rodebush, the nuclear\nphysicist, who would have to do much of the work involved in solving the\nriddles of the energies and weapons of the Nevians. Thus it did not seem\nlong before green Terra grew large beneath the flying sphere of the\n_Chicago_.\n\n\"Going to have to circle it once, aren't you?\" Cleveland asked the chief\npilot. He had been watching that officer closely for minutes, admiring\nthe delicacy and precision with which the great vessel was being\nmaneuvered preliminary to entering the Earth's atmosphere.\n\n\"Yes,\" the pilot replied. \"We had to come in in the shortest possible\ntime, and that meant a velocity here that we can't check without a\nspiral. However, even at that we saved a lot of time. You can save quite\na bit more, though, by having a rocket-plane come out to meet us\nsomewhere around fifteen or twenty thousand kilometers, depending upon\nwhere you want to land. With their drives they can match our velocity\nand still make the drop direct.\"\n\n\"Guess I'll do that--thanks,\" and the operative called his chief, only\nto learn that his suggestion had already been acted upon.\n\n\"We beat you to it, Lyman,\" Samms smiled. \"The _Silver Sliver_ is out\nthere now, looping to match your course, acceleraction, and velocity at\ntwenty two thousand kilometers. You'll be ready to transfer?\"\n\n\"I'll be ready,\" and the Quartermaster's ex-clerk went to his quarters\nand packed his dunnage-bag.\n\nIn due time the long, slender body of the rocket-plane came into view,\ncreeping \"down\" upon the space-ship from \"above,\" and Cleveland bade his\nfriends goodbye. Donning a space-suit, he stationed himself in the\nstarboard airlock. Its atmosphere was withdrawn, the outer door opened,\nand he glanced across a bare hundred feet of space at the rocket-plane\nwhich, keel ports fiercely aflame, was braking her terrific speed to\nmatch the slower pace of the gigantic sphere of war. Shaped like a\ntoothpick, needle-pointed fore and aft, with ultra-stubby wings and\nvanes, with flush-set rocket ports everywhere, built of a lustrous,\nsilvery alloy of noble and almost infusible metals--such was the private\nspeedboat of Triplanetary's head man. The fastest thing known, whether\nin planetary air, the stratosphere, or the vacuous depth of\ninterplanetary space, her first flashing trial spins had won her the\nnickname of the _Silver Sliver_. She had had a more formal name, but\nthat title had long since been buried in the Departmental files.\n\nLower and lower dropped the speedboat, her rockets flaming ever\nbrighter, until her slender length lay level with the airlock door. Then\nher blasting discharges subsided to the power necessary to match exactly\nthe _Chicago's_ acceleration.\n\n\"Ready to cut, _Chicago_! Give me a three-second call!\" snapped from the\npilot room of the _Sliver_.\n\n\"Ready to cut!\" the pilot of the _Chicago_ replied. \"Seconds! Three!\nTwo! One! CUT!\"\n\nAt the last word the power of both vessels was instantly cut off and\neverything in them became weightless. In the tiny airlock of the slender\nplane crouched a space-line man with coiled cable in readiness, but he\nwas not needed. As the flaring exhausts ceased Cleveland swung out his\nheavy bag and stepped lightly off into space, and in a right line he\nfloated directly into the open port of the rocket-plane. The door\nclanged shut behind him and in a matter of moments he stood in the\ncontrol room of the racer, divested of his armor and shaking hands with\nhis friend and co-laborer, Frederick Rodebush.\n\n\"Well, Fritz, what do you know?\" Cleveland asked, as soon as greetings\nhad been exchanged. \"How do the various reports dovetail together? I\nknow that you couldn't tell me anything on the wave, but there's no\ndanger of eavesdroppers _here_.\"\n\n\"You can't tell,\" Rodebush soberly replied. \"We're just beginning to\nwake up to the fact that there are a lot of things we don't know\nanything about. Better wait until we're back at the Hill. We have a full\nset of ultra screens around there now. There's a couple of other good\nreasons, too--it would be better for both of us to go over the whole\nthing with Virgil, from the ground up; and we can't do any more talking,\nanyway. Our orders are to get back there at maximum, and you know what\nthat means aboard the _Sliver_. Strap yourself solid in that\nshock-absorber there, and here's a pair of ear-plugs.\"\n\n\"When the _Sliver_ really cuts loose it means a rough party, all right,\"\nCleveland assented, snapping about his body the heavy spring-straps of\nhis deeply cushioned seat, \"but I'm just as anxious to get back to the\nHill as anybody can be to get me there. All set.\"\n\nRodebush waved his hand at the pilot and the purring whisper of the\nexhausts changed instantly to a deafening, continuous explosion. The men\nwere pressed deeply into their shock-absorbing chairs as the _Silver\nSliver_ spun around her longitudinal axis and darted away from the\n_Chicago_ with such a tremendous acceleration that the spherical warship\nseemed to be standing still in space. In due time the calculated\nmidpoint was reached, the slim space-plane rolled over again, and, mad\nacceleration now reversed, rushed on toward the Earth, but with\nconstantly diminishing speed. Finally a measurable atmospheric pressure\nwas encountered, the needle prow dipped downward, and the _Silver\nSliver_ shot forward upon her tiny wings and vanes, nose-rockets now\ndrumming in staccato thunder. Her metal grew hot; dull red, bright red,\nyellow, blinding white; but it neither melted nor burned. The pilot's\ncalculations had been sound, and though the limiting point of safety of\ntemperature was reached and steadily held, it was not exceeded. As the\ndensity of the air increased so decreased the velocity of the man-made\nmeteorite. So it was that a dazzling lance of fire sped high over\nSeattle, lower over Spokane, and hurled itself eastward, a furiously\nflaming arrow; slanting downward in a long, screaming dive toward the\nheart of the Rockies. As the now rapidly cooling greyhound of the skies\npassed over the western ranges of the Bitter Roots it became apparent\nthat her goal was a vast, flat-topped, conical mountain, shrouded in\nviolet light; a mountain whose height awed even its stupendous\nneighbors.\n\nWhile not artificial, the Hill had been altered markedly by the\nengineers who had built into it the headquarters of the Triplanetary\nService. Its mile-wide top was a jointless expanse of gray armor steel;\nthe steep, smooth surface of the truncated cone was a continuation of\nthe same immensely thick sheet of metal. No known vehicle could climb\nthat smooth, hard, forbidding slope of steel; no known projectile could\nmar that armor; no known craft could even approach the Hill without\ndetection. Could not approach it at all, in fact, for it was constantly\ninclosed in a vast hemisphere of lambent violet flame through which\nneither material substance nor destructive ray could pass.\n\nAs the _Silver Sliver_, crawling along at a bare five hundred miles an\nhour, approached that transparent, brilliantly violet wall of\ndestruction, a light of the same color filled her control room and as\nsuddenly went out; flashing on and off again and again.\n\n\"Giving us the once-over, eh?\" Cleveland asked. \"That's something new,\nisn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes, it's a high-powered ultra-wave spy,\" Rodebush returned. \"The light\nis simply a warning, which can be carried if desired. It can also carry\nvoice and vision....\"\n\n\"Like this,\" Samms' voice interrupted from a speaker upon the pilot's\npanel and his clear-cut face appeared upon the television screen. \"I\ndon't suppose Fred thought to mention it, but this is one of his\ninventions of the last few days. We are just trying it out on you. It\ndoesn't mean a thing though, as far as the _Sliver_ is concerned. Come\nahead!\"\n\nA circular opening appeared on the wall of force, an opening which\ndisappeared as soon as the plane had darted through it; and at the same\ntime her landing-cradle rose into the air through a great trap-door.\nSlowly and gracefully the space-plane settled downward into that\ncushioned embrace. Then cradle and nestled _Sliver_ sank from view and,\nturning smoothly upon mighty trunnions, the plug of armor drove solidly\nback into its place in the metal pavement of the mountain's lofty\nsummit. The cradle-elevator dropped rapidly, coming to rest many levels\ndown in the heart of the Hill, and Cleveland and Rodebush leaped lightly\nout of their transport, through her still hot outer walls. A door opened\nbefore them and they found themselves in a large room of unshadowed\ndaylight illumination; the office of the Chief of the Triplanetary\nService. Calmly efficient executives sat at their desks, concentrating\nupon problems or at ease, according to the demands of the moment;\nagents, secretaries, and clerks, men and women, went about their wonted\ntasks; televisotypes and recorders flashed busily but silently--each\nperson and machine an integral part of the Service which for so many\nyears had been carrying an ever-increasing share of the load of\ngoverning the three planets.\n\n\"Right of way, Norma?\" Rodebush paused before the desk of Virgil Samms'\nprivate secretary. She pressed a button and the door behind her swung\nwide.\n\n\"You two do not need to be announced,\" the attractive young woman\nsmiled. \"Go right in.\"\n\nSamms met them at the door eagerly, shaking hands particularly\nvigorously with Cleveland.\n\n\"Congratulations on that camera, Lyman!\" he exclaimed. \"You did a\nwonderful piece of work on that. Help yourselves to smokes and sit\ndown--there are a lot of things we want to talk over. Your pictures\ncarried most of the story, but they would have left us pretty much at\nsea without Costigan's reports. But as it was, Fred here and his crew\nworked out most of the answers from the dope the two of you got; and\nwhat few they haven't got yet they soon will have.\"\n\n\"Nothing new on Conway?\" Cleveland was almost afraid to ask the\nquestion.\n\n\"No.\" A shadow came over Samms' face. \"I'm afraid ... but I'm hoping\nit's only that those creatures, whatever they are, have taken him so far\naway he can't reach us.\"\n\n\"They certainly are so far away that we can't reach them,\" Rodebush\nvolunteered. \"We can't even get their ultra-wave interference any more.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's a hopeful sign,\" Samms went on. \"I hate to think of Conway\nCostigan checking out. There, fellows, was a real observer. He was the\nonly man I have ever known who combined the two qualities of the perfect\nwitness. He could actually see everything he looked at, and could report\nit truly, to the last, least detail. Take all this stuff, for instance;\nespecially their ability to transform iron into a fluid allotrope, and\nin that form to use its atomic--nuclear?--energy as power. Something\nbrand new, and yet he described their converters and projectors so\nminutely that Fred was able to work out the underlying theory in three\ndays, and to tie it in with our own super-ship. My first thought was\nthat we'd have to rebuild it iron-free, but Fred showed me my error--you\nfound it first yourself, of course.\"\n\n\"It wouldn't do any good to make the ship non-ferrous unless you could\nso change our blood chemistry that we could get along without\nhemoglobin, and that would be quite a feat,\" Cleveland agreed. \"Then,\ntoo, our most vital electrical machinery is built around iron cores.\nWe'll also have to develop a screen for those forces--screens, rather,\nso powerful that they can't drive anything through them.\"\n\n\"We've been working along those lines ever since you reported,\" Rodebush\nsaid, \"and we're beginning to see light. And in that same connection\nit's no wonder that we couldn't handle our super-ship. We had some good\nideas, but they were wrongly applied. However, things look quite\npromising now. We have the transformation of iron all worked out in\ntheory, and as soon as we get a generator going we can straighten out\neverything else in short order. And think what that unlimited power\nmeans! All the power we want--power enough even to try out such hitherto\npurely theoretical possibilities as the neutralization of the inertia of\nmatter!\"\n\n\"Hold on!\" protested Samms. \"You certainly can't do _that_! Inertia\nis--_must_ be--a basic attribute of matter, and surely cannot be done\naway with without destroying the matter itself. Don't start anything\nlike that, Fred--I don't want to lose you and Lyman, too.\"\n\n\"Don't worry about us, Chief,\" Rodebush replied with a smile. \"If you\nwill tell me what matter is, fundamentally, I may agree with you.... No?\nWell, then, don't be surprised at anything that happens. We are going to\ndo a lot of things that nobody on the Three Planets ever thought of\ndoing before.\"\n\nThus for a long time the argument and discussion went on, to be\ninterrupted by the voice of the secretary.\n\n\"Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Samms, but some things have come up that you\nwill have to handle. Knobos is calling from Mars. He has caught the\n_Endymion_, and has killed about half her crew doing it. Milton has\nfinally reported from Venus, after being out of touch for five days. He\ntrailed the Wintons into Thalleron swamp. They crashed him there, and he\nwon out and has what he went after. And just now I got a flash from\nFletcher, in the asteroid belt. I think that he has finally traced that\ndope line. But Knobos is on now--what do you want him to do about the\n_Endymion_?\"\n\n\"Tell him to--no, put him on here, I'd better tell him myself,\" Samms\ndirected, and his face hardened in ruthless decision as the horny,\nmisshapen face of the Martian lieutenant appeared upon the screen. \"What\ndo you think, Knobos? Shall they come to trial or not?\"\n\n\"Not.\"\n\n\"I don't think so, either. It is better that a few gangsters should\ndisappear in space than that the Patrol should have to put down another\nuprising. See to it.\"\n\n\"Right.\" The screen darkened and Samms spoke to his secretary. \"Put\nMilton and Fletcher on whenever they come in.\" He turned to his guests.\n\"We've covered the ground quite thoroughly. Goodbye--I wish I could go\nwith you, but I'll be pretty well tied up for the next week or two.\"\n\n\"'Tied up' doesn't half express it,\" Rodebush remarked as the two\nscientists walked along a corridor toward an elevator. \"He probably is\nthe busiest man on three planets.\"\n\n\"As well as the most powerful,\" Cleveland supplemented. \"And very few\nmen could use his power as fairly--but he's welcome to it, as far as I'm\nconcerned. I'd have the pink fantods for a month if I had to do only\nonce what he's just done--and to him it's just part of a day's work.\"\n\n\"You mean the _Endymion_? What else could he do?\"\n\n\"Nothing--that's the hell of it. It had to be done, since bringing them\nto trial would mean killing half the people of Morseca; but at the same\ntime it's a ghastly thing to order a job of deliberate, cold-blooded,\nand illegal murder.\"\n\n\"You're right, of course, but you would ...\" he broke off, unable to put\nhis thoughts into words. For while inarticulate, man-like, concerning\ntheir deepest emotions, in both men was ingrained the code of the\norganization; both knew that to every man chosen for it THE SERVICE was\neverything, himself nothing.\n\n\"But enough of that, we'll have plenty of grief of our own right here.\"\nRodebush changed the subject abruptly as they stepped into a vast room,\nalmost filled by the immense bulk of the _Boise_--the sinister\nspace-ship which, although never flown, had already lined with black so\nmany pages of Triplanetary's roster. She was now, however, the center of\na furious activity. Men swarmed over her and through her, in the orderly\nconfusion of a fiercely driven but carefully planned program of\nreconstruction.\n\n\"I hope your dope is right, Fritz!\" Cleveland called, as the two\nscientists separated to go to their respective laboratories. \"If it is,\nwe'll make a perfect lady out of this unmanageable man-killer yet!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14\n\nTHE SUPER-SHIP IS LAUNCHED\n\n\nAfter weeks of ceaseless work, during which was lavished upon her every\nresource of mind and material afforded by three planets, the _Boise_ was\nready for her maiden flight. As nearly ready, that is, as the thought\nand labor of man could make her. Rodebush and Cleveland had finished\ntheir last rigid inspection of the aircraft and, standing beside the\ncenter door of the main airlock, were talking with their chief.\n\n\"You say that you think that it's safe, and yet you won't take a crew,\"\nSamms argued. \"In that case it isn't safe enough for you two, either. We\nneed you too badly to permit you to take such chances.\"\n\n\"You've _got_ to let us go, because we are the only ones who are at all\nfamiliar with her theory,\" Rodebush insisted. \"I said, and I still say,\nthat I _think_ it is safe. I can't prove it, however, even\nmathematically; because she's altogether too full of too many new and\nuntried mechanisms, too many extrapolations beyond all existing or\npossible data. Theoretically, she is sound, but you know that theory can\ngo only so far, and that mathematically negligible factors may become\noperative at those velocities. We do not need a crew for a short trip.\nWe can take care of any minor mishaps, and if our fundamental theories\nare wrong, all the crews between here and Jupiter wouldn't do any good.\nTherefore we two are going--alone.\"\n\n\"Well, be very careful, anyway. I wish that you could start out slow and\ntake it easy.\"\n\n\"In a way, so do I, but she wasn't designed to neutralize half of\ngravity, nor half of the inertia of matter--it's got to be everything or\nnothing, as soon as the neutralizers go on. We could start out on the\nprojectors, of course, instead of on the neutralizers, but that wouldn't\nprove anything and would only prolong the agony.\"\n\n\"Well, then, be as careful as you can.\"\n\n\"We'll do that, Chief,\" Cleveland put in. \"We think as much of us as\nanybody else does--maybe more--and we aren't committing suicide if we\ncan help it. And remember about everybody staying inside when we take\noff--it's barely possible that we'll take up a lot of room. Goodbye!\"\n\n\"Goodbye, fellows!\"\n\nThe massive insulating doors were shut, the metal side of the mountain\nopened, and huge, squat caterpillar tractors came roaring and clanking\ninto the room. Chains and cables were made fast and, mighty steel rails\ngroaning under the load, the space-ship upon her rolling ways was\ndragged out of the Hill and far out upon the level floor of the valley\nbefore the tractors cast off and returned to the fortress.\n\n\"Everybody is under cover,\" Samms informed Rodebush. The Chief was\nstaring intently into his plate, upon which was revealed the control\nroom of the untried super-ship. He heard Rodebush speak to Cleveland;\nheard the observer's brief reply; saw the navigator push the\nswitch-button--then the communicator plate went blank. Not the ordinary\nblankness of a cut-off, but a peculiarly disquieting fading out into\ndarkness. And where the great space-ship had rested there was for an\ninstant nothing. Exactly nothing--a vacuum. Vessel, falsework, rollers,\ntrucks, the enormous steel I-beams of the tracks, even the deep-set\nconcrete piers and foundations and a vast hemisphere of the solid\nground; all disappeared utterly and instantaneously. But almost as\nsuddenly as it had been formed the vacuum was filled by a cyclonic rush\nof air. There was a detonation as of a hundred vicious thunderclaps made\none, and through the howling, shrieking blasts of wind there rained down\nupon valley, plain, and metaled mountain a veritable avalanche of\ndebris; bent, twisted, and broken rails and beams, splintered timbers,\nmasses of concrete, and thousands of cubic yards of soil and rock. For\nthe atomic-powered \"Rodebush-Cleveland\" neutralizers were more powerful\nby far, and had a vastly greater radius of action, than the calculations\nof their designers had shown; and for a moment everything within a\nhundred yards or so of the _Boise_ behaved as though it were an integral\npart of the vessel. Then, left behind immediately by the super-ship's\nalmost infinite velocity, all this material had again become subject to\nall of Nature's every-day laws and had crashed back to the ground.\n\n\"Could you hold your beam, Randolph?\" Samms' voice cut sharply through\nthe daze of stupefaction which held spellbound most of the denizens of\nthe Hill. But all were not so held--no conceivable emergency could take\nthe attention of the chief ultra-wave operator from his instruments.\n\n\"No, sir,\" Radio Center shot back. \"It faded out and I couldn't recover\nit. I put everything I've got behind a tracer on that beam, but haven't\nbeen able to lift a single needle off the pin.\"\n\n\"And no wreckage of the vessel itself,\" Samms went on, half audibly.\n\"Either they have succeeded far beyond their wildest hopes or else ...\nmore probably....\" He fell silent and switched off the plate. Were his\ntwo friends, those intrepid scientists, alive and triumphant, or had\nthey gone to lengthen the list of victims of that man-killing\nspace-ship? Reason told him that they were gone. They _must_ be gone, or\nelse the ultra-beams--energies of such unthinkable velocity of\npropagation that man's most sensitive instruments had never been able\neven to estimate it--would have held the ship's transmitter in spite of\nany velocity attainable by matter under any conceivable conditions. The\nship must have been disintegrated as soon as Rodebush released his\nforces. And yet, had not the physicist dimly foreseen the possibility of\nsuch an actual velocity--or had he? However, individuals could come and\ngo, but the Service went on. Samms squared his shoulders unconsciously;\nand slowly, grimly, made his way back to his private office.\n\n\"Mr. Fairchild would like to have a moment as soon as possible, sir,\"\nhis secretary informed him even before he sat down. \"Senator Morgan has\nbeen here all day, you know, and he insists on seeing you personally.\"\n\n\"Oh, that kind, eh? All right, I'll see him. Get Fairchild, please ...\nDick? Can you talk, or is he there listening?\"\n\n\"No, he's heckling Saunders at the moment. He's been here long enough.\nCan you take a minute and throw him out?\"\n\n\"Of course, if you say so, but why not throw the hooks into him\nyourself, as usual?\"\n\n\"He wants to lay down the law to you, personally. He's a Big Shot, you\nknow, and his group is kicking up quite a row, so it might be better to\nhave it come straight from the top. Besides, you've got a unique\nknack--when you throw a harpoon, the harpoonee doesn't forget it.\"\n\n\"All right. He's the uplifter and leveler-off. Down with Triplanetary, up\nwith National Sovereignty. We're power-mad dictators--iron-heel-on-the\nnecks-of-the-people, and so on. But what's he like, personally?\nThick-skinned, of course--got a brain?\"\n\n\"Rhinoceros. He's got a brain, but it's definitely weaseloid. Bear\ndown--sink it in full length, and then twist it.\"\n\n\"O.K. You've got a harpoon, of course?\"\n\n\"Three of 'em!\" Fairchild, Head of Triplanetary's Public Relations,\ngrinned with relish. \"Boss Jim Towne owns him in fee simple. The number\nof his hot lock box is N469T414. His subbest sub-rosa girl-friend is\nFi-Chi le Bay ... yes, everything that the name implies. She got a\nsuper-deluxe fur coat--Martian tekkyl, no less--out of that Mackenzie\nRiver power deal. Triple play, you might say--Clander to Morgan to le\nBay.\"\n\n\"Nice. Bring him in.\"\n\n\"Senator Morgan, Mr. Samms,\" Fairchild made the introduction and the two\nmen sized each other up in lightning glances. Samms saw a big man,\nflorid, somewhat inclined toward corpulence, with the surface\ngeniality--and the shrewd calculating eyes--of the successful\npolitician. The senator saw a tall, hard-trained man in his forties; a\nlean, keen, smooth-shaven face; a shock of red-bronze-auburn hair a\ncouple of weeks overdue for a cutting; a pair of gold-flecked tawny eyes\ntoo penetrant for comfort.\n\n\"I trust, Senator, that Fairchild has taken care of you satisfactorily?\"\n\n\"With one or two exceptions, yes.\" Since Samms did not ask what the\nexceptions could be, Morgan was forced to continue. \"I am here, as you\nknow, in my official capacity as Chairman of the Pernicious Activities\nCommittee of the North American Senate. It has been observed for years\nthat the published reports of your organization have left much unsaid.\nIt is common knowledge that high-handed outrages have been perpetrated;\nif not by your men themselves, in such circumstances that your agents\ncould not have been ignorant of them. Therefore it has been decided to\nmake a first-hand and comprehensive investigation, in which matter your\nMr. Fairchild has not been at all cooperative.\"\n\n\"Who decided to make this investigation?\"\n\n\"Why, the North American Senate, of course, through its Pernicious\nActivities....\"\n\n\"I thought so.\" Samms interrupted. \"Don't you know, Senator, that the\nHill is not a part of the North American Continent? That the\nTriplanetary Service is responsible only to the Triplanetary Council?\"\n\n\"Quibbling, sir, and outmoded! This, sir, is a democracy!\" the Senator\nbegan to orate. \"All that will be changed very shortly, and if you are\nas smart as you are believed to be, I need only say that you and those\nof your staff who cooperate....\"\n\n\"You need say nothing at all.\" Samms' voice cut. \"It has not been\nchanged yet. The Government of North America rules its continent, as do\nthe other Continental Governments. The combined Continental Governments\nof the Three Planets form the Triplanetary Council, which is a\nnon-political body, the members of which hold office for life and which\nis the supreme authority in any matter, small or large, affecting more\nthan one Continental Government. The Council has two principal operating\nagencies; the Triplanetary Patrol, which enforces its decisions, rules,\nand regulations, and the Triplanetary Service, which performs such other\ntasks as the Council directs. We have no interest in the purely internal\naffairs of North America. Have you any information to the contrary?\"\n\n\"More quibbling!\" the Senator thundered. \"This is not the first time in\nhistory that a ruthless dictatorship has operated in the disguise of a\ndemocracy. Sir, I _demand_ full access to your files, so that I can\nspread before the North American Senate the full facts of the various\nmatters which I mentioned to Fairchild--one of which was the affair of\nthe _Pelarion_. In a democracy, sir, facts should not be hidden; the\npeople must and shall be kept completely informed upon any matter which\naffects their welfare or their political lives!\"\n\n\"Is that so? If I should ask, then, for the purpose of keeping the\nTriplanetary Council, and through it your constituents, fully informed\nas to the political situation in North America, you would undoubtedly\ngive me the key to safe-deposit box N469T414? For it is common\nknowledge, in the Council at least, that there is a certain amount\nof--shall we say turbidity?--in the supposedly pellucid reaches of North\nAmerican politics.\"\n\n\"What? Preposterous!\" Morgan made a heroic effort, but could not quite\nmaintain his poise. \"Private papers only, sir!\"\n\n\"Perhaps. Certain of the Councillors believe, however mistakenly, that\nthere are several things of interest there: such as the record of\ncertain transactions involving one James F. Towne; references to and\ndetails concerning dealings--not to say deals--with Mackenzie Power,\nspecifically with Mackenzie Power's Mr. Clander; and perhaps a juicy bit\nor two concerning a person known as le Bay and a tekkyl coat. Of\ninterest no end, don't you think, to the dear people of North America?\"\n\nAs Samms drove the harpoon in and twisted it, the big man suffered\nvisibly. Nevertheless:\n\n\"You refuse to cooperate, eh?\" he blustered. \"Very well, I will go--but\nyou have not heard the last of me, Samms!\"\n\n\"No? Probably not. But remember, before you do any more rabble-rousing,\nthat this lock-box thing is merely a sample. We of the Service know a\nlot of things that we do not mention to anybody--except in\nself-defense.\"\n\n\"I am holding Fletcher, Mr. Samms. Shall I put him on now?\" Norma asked,\nas the completely deflated Morgan went out.\n\n\"Yes, please.... Hello, Sid; mighty glad to see you--we were scared for\na while. How did you make out, and what was it?\"\n\n\"Hi, Chief! Mostly hadive. Some heroin, and quite a bit of Martian\nladolian. Lousy job, though--three of the gang got away, and took about\na quarter of the loot with them. That was what I want to talk to you\nabout in such a hurry--fake meteors; the first I ever saw.\"\n\nSamms straightened up in his chair.\n\n\"Just a second. Norma, put Redmond on here with us.... Listen, Harry.\nNow, Fletcher, did you see that fake meteor yourself? Touch it?\"\n\n\"Both. In fact, I've still got it. One of the runners, pretending to be\na Service man, flashed it on _me_. It's really good, too, Chief. Even\nnow, I can't tell it from my own except that mine is in my pocket. Shall\nI send it in?\"\n\n\"By all means; to Dr. H.D. Redmond, Head of Research. Keep on slugging,\nSid--goodbye. Now, Harry, what do you think? It _could_ be one of our\nown, you know.\"\n\n\"Could be, but probably isn't. We'll know as soon as we get it in the\nlab. Chances are, though, that they have caught up with us again. After\nall, that was to be expected--anything that science can synthesize,\nscience can analyze; and whatever the morals and ethics of the pirates\nmay be, they have got brains.\"\n\n\"And you haven't been able to devise anything better?\"\n\n\"Variations only, which wouldn't take much time to solve. Fundamentally,\nthe present meteor is the best we know.\"\n\n\"Got anybody you would like to put on it, immediately?\"\n\n\"Of course. One of the new boys will be perfect for the job, I think.\nName of Bergenholm. Quite a character. Brilliant, erratic, flashes of\nsheer genius that he can't explain, even to us. I'll put him on it right\naway.\"\n\n\"Thanks a lot. And now, Norma, please keep everybody off my neck that\nyou can. I want to think.\"\n\nAnd think he did; keen eyes clouded, staring unseeingly at the papers\nlittering his desk. Triplanetary needed a symbol--a something--which\nwould identify a Service man anywhere, at any time, under any\ncircumstances, without doubt or question ... something that could not be\ncounterfeited or imitated, to say nothing of being duplicated ...\nsomething that no scientist not of Triplanetary Service could _possibly_\nimitate ... better yet, something that no one not of Triplanetary could\neven wear....\n\nSamms grinned fleetingly at that thought. A tall order one calling for a\n_deus ex machina_ with a vengeance.... But damn it, there ought to be\n_some_ way to....\n\n\"Excuse me, sir.\" His secretary's voice, usually so calm and cool,\ntrembled as she broke in on his thinking. \"Commissioner Kinnison is\ncalling. Something terrible is going on again, out toward Orion. Here he\nis,\" and there appeared upon Samms' screen the face of the Commissioner\nof Public Safety, the commander-in-chief of Triplanetary's every armed\nforce; whether of land or of water, of air or of empty space.\n\n\"They've come back, Virgil!\" The Commissioner rapped out without\npreliminary or greeting. \"Four vessels gone--a freighter and a passenger\nliner, with her escort of two heavy cruisers. All in Sector M, Dx about\n151. I have ordered all traffic out of space for the duration of the\nemergency, and since even our warships seem useless, every ship is\nmaking for the nearest dock at maximum. How about that new flyer of\nyours--got anything that will do us any good?\" No one beyond the\n\"Hill's\" shielding screens knew that the _Boise_ had already been\nlaunched.\n\n\"I don't know. We don't even know whether we have a super-ship or not,\"\nand Samms described briefly the beginning--and very probably the\nending--of the trial flight, concluding: \"It looks bad, but if there was\nany possible way of handling her, Rodebush and Cleveland did it. All our\ntracers are negative yet, so nothing definite has....\"\n\nHe broke off as a frantic call came in from the Pittsburgh station for\nthe Commissioner; a call which Samms both heard and saw.\n\n\"The city is being attacked!\" came the urgent message. \"We need all the\nreenforcements you can send us!\" and a picture of the beleaguered city\nappeared in ghastly detail upon the screens of the observers; a view\nbeing recorded from the air. It required only seconds for the\ncommissioner to order every available man and engine of war to the seat\nof conflict; then, having done everything they could do, Kinnison and\nSamms stared in helpless, fascinated horror into their plates, watching\nthe scenes of carnage and destruction depicted there.\n\nThe Nevian vessel--the sister-ship, the craft which Costigan had seen in\nmid-space as it hurtled Earthward in response to Nerado's summons--hung\npoised in full visibility high above the metropolis. Scornful of the\npitiful weapons wielded by man, she hung there, her sinister beauty of\nline sharply defined against the cloudless sky. From her shining hull\nthere reached down a tenuous but rigid rod of crimson energy; a rod\nwhich slowly swept hither and thither as the Nevians searched out the\nrichest deposits of the precious metal for which they had come so far.\nIron, once solid, now a viscous red liquid, was sluggishly flowing in an\never-thickening stream up that intangible crimson duct and into the\ncapacious storage tanks of the Nevian raider; and wherever that flaming\nbeam went there went also ruin, destruction and death. Office buildings,\nskyscrapers towering majestically in their architectural symmetry and\nbeauty, collapsed into heaps of debris as their steel skeletons were\nabstracted. Deep into the ground the beam bored; flood, fire, and\nexplosion following in its wake as the mazes of underground piping\ndisappeared. And the humanity of the buildings died: instantaneously and\npainlessly, never knowing what struck them, as the life-bearing iron of\ntheir bodies went to swell the Nevian stream.\n\nPittsburgh's defenses had been feeble indeed. A few antiquated railway\nrifles had hurled their shells upward in futile defiance, and had been\nquietly absorbed. The district planes of Triplanetary, newly armed with\niron-driven ultra-beams, had assembled hurriedly and had attacked the\ninvader in formation, with but little more success. Under the impact of\ntheir beams, the stranger's screens had flared white, then poised ship\nand flying squadron had alike been lost to view in a murkily opaque\nshroud of crimson flame. The cloud had soon dissolved, and from the\nplace where the planes had been there floated or crashed down a litter\nof non-ferrous wreckage. And now the cone of space-ships from the\nBuffalo base of Triplanetary was approaching Pittsburgh hurling itself\ntoward the Nevian plunderer and toward known, gruesome, and hopeless\ndefeat.\n\n\"Stop them, Rod!\" Samms cried. \"It's sheer slaughter! They haven't got a\nthing--they aren't even equipped yet with the iron drive!\"\n\n\"I know it,\" the commissioner groaned, \"and Admiral Barnes knows it as\nwell as we do, but it can't be helped--wait a minute! The Washington\ncone is reporting. They're as close as the other, and they have the new\narmament. Philadelphia is close behind, and so is New York. Now perhaps\nwe can do something!\"\n\nThe Buffalo flotilla slowed and stopped, and in a matter of minutes the\ndetachments from the other bases arrived. The cone was formed and,\niron-driven vessels in the van, the old-type craft far in the rear, it\nbore down upon the Nevian, vomiting from its hollow front a solid\ncylinder of annihilation. Once more the screens of the Nevian flared\ninto brilliance, once more the red cloud of destruction was flung\nabroad. But these vessels were not entirely defenseless. Their\niron-driven ultra-generators threw out screens of the Nevians' own\nformulae, screens of prodigious power to which the energies of the\namphibians clung and at which they clawed and tore in baffled, wildly\ncoruscant displays of power unthinkable. For minutes the furious\nconflict raged, while the inconceivable energy being dissipated by those\nstraining screens hurled itself in terribly destructive bolts of\nlightning upon the city far beneath.\n\nNo battle of such incredible violence could long endure. Triplanetary's\nships were already exerting their utmost power, while the Nevians,\ncontemptuous of Solarian science, had not yet uncovered their full\nstrength. Thus the last desperate effort of mankind was proved futile as\nthe invaders forced their beams deeper and deeper into the overloaded\ndefensive screens of the war-vessels; and one by one the supposedly\ninvincible space-ships of humanity dropped in horribly dismembered ruin\nupon the ruins of what had once been Pittsburgh.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 15\n\nSPECIMENS\n\n\nOnly too well founded was Costigan's conviction that the submarine of\nthe deep-sea fishes had not been able to prevail against Nerado's\nformidable engines of destruction. For days the Nevian lifeboat with\nits three Terrestrial passengers hurtled through the interstellar void\nwithout incident, but finally the operative's fears were realized--his\nfar flung detector screens reacted; upon his observation plate they\ncould see Nerado's mammoth space-ship, in full pursuit of its fleeing\nlifeboat!\n\n\"On your toes, folks--it won't be long now!\" Costigan called, and\nBradley and Clio hurried into the tiny control room.\n\nArmor donned and tested, the three Terrestrials stared into the\nobservation plates, watching the rapidly-enlarging picture of the Nevian\nspace-ship. Nerado had traced them and was following them, and such was\nthe power of the great vessel that the now inconceivable velocity of the\nlifeboat was the veriest crawl in comparison to that of the pursuing\ncruiser.\n\n\"And we've hardly started to cover the distance back to Tellus. Of\ncourse you couldn't get in touch with anybody yet?\" Bradley stated,\nrather than asked.\n\n\"I kept trying, of course, until they blanketed my wave, but all\nnegative. Thousands of times too far for my transmitter. Our only hope\nof reaching anybody was the mighty slim chance that our super-ship might\nbe prowling around out here already, but it isn't, of course. Here they\nare!\"\n\nReaching out to the control panel, Costigan viciously shot out against\nthe great vessel wave after wave of lethal vibrations, under whose\nfiercely clinging impacts the Nevian defensive screens flared white;\nbut, strangely enough, their own screens did not radiate. As if\ncontemptuous of any weapons the lifeboat might wield, the mother ship\nsimply defended herself from the attacking beams, in much the same\nfashion as a wildcat mother wards off the claws and teeth of her\nspitting, snarling kitten who is resenting a touch of needed maternal\ndiscipline.\n\n\"They probably wouldn't fight us, at that,\" Clio first understood the\nsituation. \"This is their own lifeboat, and they want us alive, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"There's one more thing we can try--hang on!\" Costigan snapped, as he\nreleased his screens and threw all his power into one enormous pressor\nbeam.\n\nThe three were thrown to the floor and held there by an awful weight as\nthe lifeboat darted away at the stupendous acceleration of the beam's\nreaction against the unimaginable mass of the Nevian sky-rover; but the\nflight was of short duration. Along that pressor beam there crept a dull\nred rod of energy, which surrounded the fugitive shell and brought it\nslowly to a halt. Furiously then Costigan set and reset his controls,\nlaunching his every driving force and his every weapon, but no beam\ncould penetrate that red murk, and the lifeboat remained motionless in\nspace. No, not motionless--the red rod was shortening, drawing the\ntruant craft back toward the launching port from which she had so\nhopefully emerged a few days before. Back and back it was drawn;\nCostigan's utmost efforts futile to affect by a hair's breadth its line\nof motion. Through the open port the boat slipped neatly, and as it came\nto a halt in its original position within the multi-layered skin of the\nmonster, the prisoners heard the heavy doors clang shut behind them, one\nafter another.\n\nAnd then sheets of blue fire snapped and crackled about the three suits\nof Triplanetary armor--the two large human figures and the small ones\nwere outlined starkly in blinding blue flame.\n\n\"That's the first thing that has come off according to schedule.\"\nCostigan laughed, a short, fierce bark. \"That is their paralyzing ray,\nwe've got it stopped cold, and we've each got enough iron to hold it\nforever.\"\n\n\"But it looks as though the best we can do is a stalemate,\" Bradley\nargued. \"Even if they can't paralyze us, we can't hurt them, and we are\nheading back for Nevia.\"\n\n\"I think Nerado will come in for a conference, and we'll be able to make\nterms of some kind. He must know what these Lewistons will do, and he\nknows that we'll get a chance to use them, some way or other, before he\ngets to us again,\" Costigan asserted, confidently--but again he was\nwrong.\n\nThe door opened, and through it there waddled, rolled, or crawled a\nmetal-clad monstrosity--a thing with wheels, legs and writhing tentacles\nof jointed bronze; a thing possessed of defensive screens sufficiently\npowerful to absorb the full blast of the Triplanetary projectors without\neffort. Three brazen tentacles reached out through the ravening beams of\nthe Lewistons, smashed them to bits, and wrapped themselves in\nunbreakable shackles about the armored forms of the three human beings.\nThrough the door the machine or creature carried its helpless load, and\nout into and along a main corridor. And soon the three Terrestrials,\nwithout arms, without armor, and almost without clothing, were standing\nin the control room, again facing the calm and unmoved Nerado. To the\nsurprise of the impetuous Costigan, the Nevian commander was entirely\nwithout rancor.\n\n\"The desire for freedom is perhaps common to all forms of animate life,\"\nhe commented, through the transformer. \"As I told you before, however,\nyou are specimens to be studied by the College of Science, and you shall\nbe so studied in spite of anything you may do. Resign yourselves to\nthat.\"\n\n\"Well, say that we don't try to make any more trouble; that we cooperate\nin the examination and give you whatever information we can,\" Costigan\nsuggested. \"Then you will probably be willing to give us a ship and let\nus go back to our own world?\"\n\n\"You will not be allowed to cause any more trouble,\" the amphibian\ndeclared, coldly. \"Your cooperation will not be required. We will take\nfrom you whatever knowledge and information we wish. In all probability\nyou will never be allowed to return to your own system, because as\nspecimens you are too unique to lose. But enough of this idle\nchatter--take them back to their quarters!\"\n\nBack to their three inter-communicating rooms the prisoners were led\nunder heavy guard; and, true to his word, Nerado made certain that they\nhad no more opportunities to escape. To Nevia the space-ship sped\nwithout incident, and in manacles the Terrestrials were taken to the\nCollege of Science, there to undergo the physical and psychical\nexaminations which Nerado had promised them.\n\nNor had the Nevian scientist-captain erred in stating that their\ncooperation was neither needed nor desired. Furious but impotent, the\nhuman beings were studied in laboratory after laboratory by the coldly\nanalytical, unfeeling scientists of Nevia, to whom they were nothing\nmore or less than specimens; and in full measure they came to know what\nit meant to play the part of an unknown, lowly organism in a biological\nresearch. They were photographed, externally and internally. Every bone,\nmuscle, organ, vessel, and nerve was studied and charted. Every reflex\nand reaction was noted and discussed. Meters registered every impulse\nand recorders filmed every thought, every idea, and every sensation.\nEndlessly, day after day, the nerve-wracking torture went on, until the\nfrantic subjects could bear no more. White-faced and shaking, Clio\nfinally screamed wildly, hysterically, as she was being strapped down\nupon a laboratory bench; and at the sound Costigan's nerves, already at\nthe breaking point, gave way in an outburst of berserk fury.\n\nThe man's struggles and the girl's shrieks were alike futile, but the\nsurprised Nevians, after a consultation, decided to give the specimens\na vacation. To that end they were installed, together with their Earthly\nbelongings, in a three-roomed structure of transparent metal, floating\nin the large central lagoon of the city. There they were left\nundisturbed for a time--undisturbed, that is, except by the continuous\ngaze of the crowd of hundreds of amphibians which constantly surrounded\nthe floating cottage.\n\n\"First we're bugs under a microscope,\" Bradley growled, \"then we're\ngoldfish in a bowl. I don't know that....\"\n\nHe broke off as two of their jailers entered the room. Without a word\ninto the transformers they seized Bradley and Clio. As those tentacular\narms stretched out toward the girl, Costigan leaped. A vain attempt. In\nmidair the paralyzing beam of the Nevians touched him and he crashed\nheavily to the crystal floor; and from that floor he looked on in\nhelpless, raging fury while his sweetheart and his captain were carried\nout of their prison and into a waiting submarine.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 16\n\nSUPER-SHIP IN ACTION\n\n\nDoctor Frederick Rodebush sat at the control panel of Triplanetary's\nnewly reconstructed super-ship; one finger poised over a small black\nbutton. Facing the unknown though the physicist was, yet he grinned\nwhimsically at his friend.\n\n\"Something, whatever it is, is about to occur. The _Boise_ is about to\ntake off. Ready, Cleve?\"\n\n\"Shoot!\" laconically. Cleveland also was constitutionally unable to\nvoice his deeper sentiments in time of stress.\n\nRodebush drove his finger down, and instantly over both men there came a\nsensation akin to a tremendously intensified vertigo; but a vertigo as\nfar beyond the space-sickness of weightlessness as that horrible\nsensation is beyond mere Earthly dizziness. The pilot reached weakly\ntoward the board, but his leaden hands refused utterly to obey the\ndictates of his reeling mind. His brain was a writhing, convulsive mass\nof torment indescribable; expanding, exploding, swelling out with an\nunendurable pressure against its confining skull. Fiery spirals, laced\nwith streaming, darting lances of black and green, flamed inside his\nbursting eyeballs. The Universe spun and whirled in mad gyrations about\nhim as he reeled drunkenly to his feet, staggering and sprawling. He\nfell. He realized that he was falling, yet he could not fall! Thrashing\nwildly, grotesquely in agony, he struggled madly and blindly across the\nroom, directly toward the thick steel wall. The tip of one hair of his\nunruly thatch touched the wall, and the slim length of that single hair\ndid not even bend as its slight strength brought to an instant halt the\nhundred-and-eighty-odd pounds of mass--mass now entirely without\ninertia--that was his body.\n\nBut finally the sheer brain power of the man began to triumph over his\nphysical torture. By force of will he compelled his grasping hands to\nseize a life-line, almost meaningless to his dazed intelligence; and\nthrough that nightmare incarnate of hellish torture he fought his way\nback to the control board. Hooking one leg around a standard, he made a\nseemingly enormous effort and depressed a red button; then fell flat\nupon the floor, weakly but in a wave of relief and thankfulness, as his\nracked body felt again the wonted phenomena of weight and of inertia.\nWhite, trembling, frankly and openly sick, the two men stared at each\nother in half-amazed joy.\n\n\"It worked,\" Cleveland smiled wanly as he recovered sufficiently to\nspeak, then leaped to his feet. \"Snap it up, Fred! We must be falling\nfast--we'll be wrecked when we hit!\"\n\n\"We're not falling anywhere.\" Rodebush, foreboding in his eyes, walked\nover to the main observation plate and scanned the heavens. \"However,\nit's not as bad as I was afraid it might be. I can still recognize a few\nof the constellations, even though they are all pretty badly distorted.\nThat means that we can't be more than a couple of light-years or so away\nfrom the Solar System. Of course, since we had so little thrust on,\npractically all of our energy and time was taken up in getting out of\nthe atmosphere. Even at that, though, it's a good thing that space isn't\na perfect vacuum, or we would have been clear out of the Universe by\nthis time.\"\n\n\"Huh? What are you talking about? Impossible! Where are we, anyway? Then\nwe must be making mil.... Oh, I see!\" Cleveland exclaimed, somewhat\nincoherently, as he also stared into the plate.\n\n\"Right. We aren't traveling at all--_now_.\" Rodebush replied. \"We are\nperfectly stationary relative to Tellus, since we made that hop without\ninertia. We must have attained one hundred percent neutralization--one\nhundred point oh oh oh oh oh--which we didn't quite expect. Therefore we\nmust have stopped instantaneously when our inertia was restored.\nIncidentally, that original, pre-inertialess velocity 'intrinsic'\nvelocity, suppose we could call it?--is going to introduce plenty of\ncomplications, but we don't have to worry about them right now. Also, it\nisn't _where_ we are that is worrying me--we can get fixes on enough\nrecognizable stars to find that out in short order--it's _when_.\"\n\n\"That's right, too. Say we're two light years away from home. You think\nmaybe that we're two years older now than we were ten minutes ago?\nInteresting no end--and distinctly possible. Maybe even probable--I\nwouldn't know--there's been a lot of discussion on that theory, and as\nfar as I know we're the first ones who ever had a chance to prove or\ndisprove it absolutely. Let's snap back to Tellus and find out, right\nnow.\"\n\n\"We'll do that, after a little more experimenting. You see, I had no\nintention of giving us such a long push. I was going to throw the\nswitches in and out, but you know what happened. However, there's one\ngood thing about it--it's worth two years of anybody's life to settle\nthat relativity-time thing definitely, one way or the other.\"\n\n\"I'll say it is. But say, we've got a lot of power on our ultra-wave;\nenough to reach Tellus, I think. Let's locate the sun and get in touch\nwith Samms.\"\n\n\"Let's work on these controls a little first, so we'll have something to\nreport. Out here's a fine place to try the ship out--nothing in the\nway.\"\n\n\"All right with me. But I _would_ like to find out whether I'm two years\nolder than I think I am, or not!\"\n\nThen for four hours they put the great super-ship through her paces,\njust as test-pilots check up on every detail of performance of an\nairplane of new and radical design. They found that the horrible vertigo\ncould be endured, perhaps in time even conquered as space-sickness could\nbe conquered, by a strong will in a sound body; and that their new\nconveyance had possibilities of which even Rodebush had never dreamed.\nFinally, their most pressing questions answered, they turned their most\npowerful ultra-beam communicator toward the yellowish star which they\nknew to be Old Sol.\n\n\"Samms ... Samms.\" Cleveland spoke slowly and distinctly. \"Rodebush and\nCleveland reporting from the 'Space-Eating Wampus', now directly in line\nwith Beta Ursae Minoris from the sun, distance about two point two light\nyears. It will take six bands of tubes on your tightest beam, LSV3, to\nreach us. Barring a touch of an unusually severe type of space-sickness,\neverything worked beautifully; even better than either of us dared to\nbelieve. There's something we want to know right away--have we been gone\nfour hours and some odd minutes, or better than two years?\"\n\nHe turned to Rodebush and went on:\n\n\"Nobody knows how fast this ultra-wave travels, but if it goes as fast\nas we did coming out it's no creeper. I'll give him about thirty\nminutes, then shoot in another....\"\n\nBut, interrupting Cleveland's remark, the care-ravaged face of Virgil\nSamms appeared sharp and clear upon the plate and his voice snapped\ncurtly from the speaker.\n\n\"Thank God you're alive, and twice that that the ship works!\" he\nexclaimed. \"You've been gone four hours, eleven minutes, and forty one\nseconds, but never mind about abstract theorizing. Get back here, to\nPittsburgh, as fast as you can drive. That Nevian vessel or another one\nlike her is mopping up the city, and has destroyed half the Fleet\nalready!\"\n\n\"We'll be back there in nine minutes!\" Rodebush snapped into the\ntransmitter. \"Two to get from here to atmosphere, four from Atmosphere\ndown to the Hill, and three to cool off. Notify the full four-shift\ncrew--everybody we've picked out. Don't need anybody else. Ship,\nequipment, and armament are _ready_!\"\n\n\"Two minutes to atmosphere? Think you can do it?\" Cleveland asked, as\nRodebush flipped off the power and leaped to the control panel. \"You\nmight, though, at that.\"\n\n\"We could do it in less than that if we had to. We used scarcely any\npower at all coming out, and I'm going to use quite a lot going back,\"\nthe physicist explained rapidly, as he set the dials which would\ndetermine their flashing course.\n\nThe master switches were thrown and the pangs of inertialessness again\nassailed them--but weaker far this time than ever before--and upon their\nlookout plates they beheld a spectacle never before seen by eye of man.\nFor the ultra-beam, with its heterodyned vision, is not distorted by any\nvelocity yet attained, as are the ether-borne rays of light. Converted\ninto light only at the plate, it showed their progress as truly as\nthough they had been traveling at a pace to be expressed in the ordinary\nterms of miles per hour. The yellow star that was the sun detached\nitself from the firmament and leaped toward them, swelling visibly,\nmomently, into a blinding monster of incandescence. And toward them also\nflung the Earth, enlarging with such indescribable rapidity that\nCleveland protested involuntarily, in spite of his knowledge of the\npeculiar mechanics of the vessel in which they were.\n\n\"Hold it, Fred, hold it! Way 'nuff!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"I'm using only a few thousand kilograms of thrust, and I'll cut that as\nsoon as we touch atmosphere, long before she can even begin to heat,\"\nRodebush explained. \"Looks bad, but we'll stop without a jar.\"\n\n\"What would you call this kind of flight, Fritz?\" Cleveland asked.\n\"What's the opposite of 'inert'?\"\n\n\"Damned if I know. Isn't any, I guess. Light? No ... how would 'free'\nbe?\"\n\n\"Not bad. 'Free' and 'Inert' maneuvering, eh? O.K.\"\n\nFlying \"free\", then, the super-ship came from her practically infinite\nvelocity to an almost instantaneous halt in the outermost, most tenuous\nlayer of the Earth's atmosphere. Her halt was but momentary. Inertia\nrestored, she dropped at a sharp angle downward. More than dropped; she\nwas forced downward by one full battery of projectors; projectors driven\nby iron-powered generators. Soon they were over the Hill, whose violet\nscreens went down at a word.\n\nFlaming a dazzling white from the friction of the atmosphere through\nwhich she had torn her way, the _Boise_ slowed abruptly as she neared\nthe ground, plunging toward the surface of the small but deep artificial\nlake below the Hill's steel apron. Into the cold waters the space-ship\ndove, and even before they could close over her, furious geysers of\nsteam and boiling water erupted as the stubborn alloy gave up its heat\nto the cooling liquid. Endlessly the three necessary minutes dragged\ntheir slow way into time, but finally the water ceased boiling and\nRodebush tore the ship from the lake and hurled her into the gaping\ndoorway of her dock. The massive doors of the airlocks opened, and while\nthe full crew of picked men hurried aboard with their personal\nequipment, Samms talked earnestly to the two scientists in the control\nroom.\n\n\"... and about half the fleet is still in the air. They aren't\nattacking; they are just trying to keep her from doing much more damage\nuntil you can get there. How about your take-off? We can't launch you\nagain--the tracks are gone--but you handled her easily enough coming\nin?\"\n\n\"That was all my fault,\" Rodebush admitted. \"I had no idea that the\nfields would extend beyond the hull. We'll take her out on the\nprojectors this time, though, the same as we brought her in--she handles\nlike a bicycle. The projector blast tears things up a little, but\nnothing serious. Have you got that Pittsburgh beam for me yet? We're\nabout ready to go.\"\n\n\"Here it is, Doctor Rodebush,\" came Norma's voice, and upon the screen\nthere flashed into being the view of the events transpiring above that\ndoomed city. \"The dock is empty and sealed against your blast.\"\n\n\"Goodbye, and power to your tubes!\" came Samms' ringing voice.\n\nAs the words were being spoken mighty blasts of power raved from the\ndriving projectors, and the immense mass of the super-ship shot out\nthrough the portals and upward into the stratosphere. Through the\ntenuous atmosphere the huge globe rushed with ever-mounting speed, and\nwhile the hope of Triplanetary drove eastward Rodebush studied the\never-changing scene of battle upon his plate and issued detailed\ninstructions to the highly trained specialists manning every offensive\nand defensive weapon.\n\nBut the Nevians did not wait to join battle until the newcomers arrived.\nTheir detectors were sensitive--operative over untold thousands of\nmiles--and the ultra-screen of the Hill had already been noted by the\ninvaders as the Earth's only possible source of trouble. Thus the\ndeparture of the _Boise_ had not gone unnoticed, and the fact that not\neven with his most penetrant rays could he see into her interior had\nalready given the Nevian commander some slight concern. Therefore as\nsoon as it was determined that the great globe was being directed toward\nPittsburgh the fish-shaped cruiser of the void went into action.\n\nHigh in the stratosphere, speeding eastward, the immense mass of the\n_Boise_ slowed abruptly, although no projector had slackened its effort.\nCleveland, eyes upon interferometer grating and spectrophotometer\ncharts, fingers flying over calculator keys, grinned as he turned toward\nRodebush.\n\n\"Just as you thought, Skipper; an ultra-band pusher. C4V63L29. Shall I\ngive him a little pull?\"\n\n\"Not yet; let's feel him out a little before we force a close-up. We've\ngot plenty of mass. See what he does when I put full push on the\nprojectors.\"\n\nAs the full power of the Tellurian vessel was applied the Nevian was\nforced backward, away from the threatened city, against the full drive\nof her every projector. Soon, however, the advance was again checked,\nand both scientists read the reason upon their plates. The enemy had put\ndown reenforcing rods of tremendous power. Three compression members\nspread out fanwise behind her, bracing her against a low mountainside,\nwhile one huge tractor beam was thrust directly downward, holding in an\nunbreakable grip a cylinder of earth extending deep down into bedrock.\n\n\"Two can play at that game!\" and Rodebush drove down similar beams, and\nforward-reaching tractors as well. \"Strap yourselves in solid,\neverybody!\" he sounded in general warning. \"Something is going to give\nway somewhere soon, and when it does we'll get a jolt!\"\n\nAnd the promised jolt did indeed come soon. Prodigiously massive and\npowerful as the Nevian was, the _Boise_ was even more massive and more\npowerful; and as the already enormous energy feeding the tractors,\npushers, and projectors was raised to its inconceivable maximum, the\nvessel of the enemy was hurled upward, backward; and that of Earth shot\nahead with a bounding leap that threatened to strain even her mighty\nmembers. The Nevian anchor rods had not broken; they had simply pulled\nup the vast cylinders of solid rock that had formed their anchorages.\n\n\"Grab him now!\" Rodebush yelled, and even while an avalanche of falling\nrock was burying the countryside Cleveland snapped a tractor ray upon\nthe flying fish and pulled tentatively.\n\nNor did the Nevian now seem averse to coming to grips. The two warring\nsuper-dreadnoughts darted toward each other, and from the invader there\nflooded out the dread crimson opacity which had theretofore meant the\ndoom of all things Solarian. Flooded out and engulfed the immense globe\nof humanity's hope in its spreading cloud of redly impenetrable murk.\nBut not for long. Triplanetary's super-ship boasted no ordinary\nTerrestrial defense, but was sheathed in screen after screen of\nultra-vibrations: imponderable walls, it is true, but barriers\nimpenetrable to any unfriendly wave. To the outer screen the red veil of\nthe Nevians clung tenaciously, licking greedily at every square inch of\nthe shielding sphere of force, but unable to find an opening through\nwhich to feed upon the steel of the _Boise's_ armor.\n\n\"Get back--'way back! Go back and help Pittsburgh!\" Rodebush drove an\nultra communicator beam through the murk to the instruments of the\nTerrestrial admiral; for the surviving warships of the fleet--its most\npowerful units--were hurling themselves forward, to plunge into that red\ndestruction. \"None of you will last a second in this red field. And\nwatch out for a violet field pretty soon--it'll be worse than this. We\ncan handle them alone, I think; but if we can't, there's nothing in the\nSystem that can help us!\"\n\nAnd now the hitherto passive screen of the super-ship became active. At\nfirst invisible, it began to glow in fierce violet light, and as the\nglow brightened to unbearable intensity the entire spherical shield\nbegan to increase in size. Driven outward from the super-ship as a\ncenter, its advancing surface of seething energy consumed the crimson\nmurk as a billow of blast-furnace heat consumes the cloud of snowflakes\nin the air above its cupola. Nor was the red death-mist all that was\nconsumed. Between that ravening surface and the armor skin of the\n_Boise_ there was nothing. No debris, no atmosphere, no vapor, no single\natom of material substance--the first time in Terrestrial experience\nthat an absolute vacuum had ever been attained!\n\nStubbornly contesting every foot of way lost, the Nevian fog retreated\nbefore the violet sphere of nothingness. Back and back it fell,\ndisappearing altogether from all space as the violet tide engulfed the\nenemy vessel; but the flying fish did not disappear. Her triple screens\nflashed into furiously incandescent splendor and she entered unscathed\nthat vacuous sphere, which collapsed instantly into an enormously\nelongated ellipsoid, at each focus a madly warring ship of space.\n\nThen in that tube of vacuum was waged a spectacular duel of\nultra-weapons--weapons impotent in air, but deadly in empty space.\nBeams, rays, and rods of Titanic power smote crackingly against\nultra-screens equally capable. Time after time each contestant ran the\ngamut of the spectrum with his every available ultra-force, only to find\nall channels closed. For minutes the terrible struggle went on, then:\n\n\"Cooper, Adlington, Spencer, Dutton!\" Rodebush called into his\ntransmitter. \"Ready? Can't touch him on the ultra, so I'm going onto the\nmacro-bands. Give him everything you have as soon as I collapse the\nviolet. Go!\"\n\nAt the word the violet barrier went down, and with a crash as of a\ndisrupting Universe the atmosphere rushed into the void. And through the\nhurricane there shot out the deadliest material weapons of Triplanetary.\nTorpedoes--non-ferrous, ultra-screened, beam-dirigible torpedoes charged\nwith the most effective forms of material destruction known to man.\nCooper hurled his canisters of penetrating gas, Adlington his\nallotropic-iron atomic bombs, Spencer his indestructible armor-piercing\nprojectiles, and Dutton his shatterable flasks of the quintessence of\ncorrosion--a sticky, tacky liquid of such dire potency that only one\nrare Solarian element could contain it. Ten, twenty, fifty, a hundred\nwere thrown as fast as the automatic machinery could launch them; and\nthe Nevians found them adversaries not to be despised. Size for size,\ntheir screens were quite as capable as those of the _Boise_. The\nNevians' destructive rays glanced harmlessly from their shields, and the\nNevians' elaborate screens, neutralized at impact by those of the\ntorpedoes, were impotent to impede their progress. Each projectile must\nneeds be caught and crushed individually by beams of the most prodigious\npower; and while one was being annihilated dozens more were rushing to\nthe attack. Then while the twisting, dodging invader was busiest with\nthe tiny but relentless destroyers, Rodebush launched his heaviest\nweapon.\n\nThe macro-beams! Prodigious streamers of bluish-green flame which tore\nsavagely through course after course of Nevian screen! Malevolent fangs,\ndriven with such power and velocity that they were biting into the very\nwalls of the enemy vessel before the amphibians knew that their\ndefensive shells of force had been punctured! And the emergency screens\nof the invaders were equally futile. Course after course was sent out,\nonly to flare viciously through the spectrum and to go black.\n\nOutfought at every turn, the now frantically dodging Nevian leaped away\nin headlong flight, only to be brought to a staggering, crashing halt as\nCleveland nailed her with a tractor beam. But the Tellurians were to\nlearn that the Nevians held in reserve a means of retreat. The tractor\nsnapped--sheared off squarely by a sizzling plane of force--and the\nfish-shaped cruiser faded from Cleveland's sight, just as the _Boise_\nhad disappeared from the communicator plates of Radio Center, back in\nthe Hill, when she was launched. But though the plates in the control\nroom could not hold the Nevian, she did not vanish beyond the ken of\nRandolph, now Communications Officer in the super-ship. For, warned and\nhumiliated by his losing one speeding vessel from his plates in Radio\nCenter, he was now ready for any emergency. Therefore as the Nevian fled\nRandolph's spy-ray held her, automatically behind it as there was the\nfull output of twelve special banks of iron-driven power tubes; and thus\nit was that the vengeful Earthmen flashed immediately along the Nevians'\nline of flight. Inertialess now, pausing briefly from time to time to\nenable the crew to accustom themselves to the new sensations,\nTriplanetary's super-ship pursued the invader; hurtling through the void\nwith a velocity unthinkable.\n\n\"He was easier to take than I thought he would be,\" Cleveland grunted,\nstaring into the plate.\n\n\"I thought he had more stuff, too,\" Rodebush assented, \"but I guess\nCostigan got almost everything they had. If so, with all our own stuff\nand most of theirs besides, we should be able to take them. Conway's\ndata indicated that they have only partial neutralization of inertia--if\nit's one hundred percent we'll never catch them--but it isn't--there\nthey are!\"\n\n\"And this time I'm going to hold her or burn out all our generators\ntrying,\" Cleveland declared, grimly. \"Are you fellows down there able to\nhandle yourselves yet? Fine! Start throwing out your cans!\"\n\nSpace-hardened veterans, all, the other Tellurian officers had fought\noff the horrible nausea of inertialessness, just as Rodebush and\nCleveland had done. Again the ravening green macro-beams tore at the\nflying cruiser, again the mighty frames of the two space-ships shuddered\nsickeningly as Cleveland clamped on his tractor rod, again the highly\ndirigible torpedoes dashed out with their freights of death and\ndestruction. And again the Nevian shear-plane of force slashed at the\n_Boise's_ tractor beam; but this time the mighty puller did not give\nway. Sparkling and spitting high-tension sparks, the plane bit deeply\ninto the stubborn rod of energy. Brighter, thicker, and longer grew the\ndischarges as the gnawing plane drew more and more power; but in direct\nratio to that power the rod grew larger, denser, and ever harder to cut.\nMore and more vivid became the pyrotechnic display, until suddenly the\nentire tractor rod disappeared. At the same instant a blast of\nintolerable flame erupted from the _Boise's_ flank and the whole\nenormous fabric of her shook and quivered under the force of a terrific\ndetonation.\n\n\"Randolph! I don't see them! Are they attacking or running?\" Rodebush\ndemanded. He was the first to realize what had happened.\n\n\"Running--fast!\"\n\n\"Just as well, perhaps, but get their line. Adlington!\"\n\n\"Here!\"\n\n\"Good! Was afraid you were gone--that was one of your bombs, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes. Well launched, just inside the screens. Don't see how it could\nhave detonated unless something hot and hard struck it in the tube; it\nwould need about that much time to explode. Good thing it didn't go off\nany sooner, or none of us would have been here. As it is, Area Six is\npretty well done in, but the bulkheads held the damage to Six. What\nhappened?\"\n\n\"We don't know, exactly. Both generators on the tractor beam went out.\nAt first, I thought that was all, but my neutralizers are dead and I\ndon't know what else. When the G-4's went out the fusion must have\nshorted the neutralizers. They would make a mess; it must have burned a\nhole down into number six tube. Cleveland and I will come down, and\nwe'll all look around.\"\n\nDonning space-suits, the scientists let themselves into the damaged\ncompartment through the emergency airlocks, and what a sight they saw!\nBoth outer and inner walls of alloy armor had been blown away by the\nawful force of the explosion. Jagged plates hung awry; bent, twisted and\nbroken. The great torpedo tube, with all its intricate automatic\nmachinery, had been driven violently backward and lay piled in hideous\nconfusion against the backing bulkheads. Practically nothing remained\nwhole in the entire compartment.\n\n\"Nothing much we can do here,\" Rodebush said finally, through his\ntransmitter. \"Let's go see what number four generator looks like.\"\n\nThat room, although not affected by the explosion from without, had been\nquite as effectively wrecked from within. It was still stiflingly hot;\nits air was still reeking with the stench of burning lubricant,\ninsulation, and metal; its floor was half covered by a semi-molten mass\nof what had once been vital machinery. For with the burning out of the\ngenerator bars the energy of the disintegrating allotropic iron had had\nno outlet, and had built up until it had broken through its insulation\nand in an irresistible flood of power had torn through all obstacles in\nits path to neutralization.\n\n\"Hm ... m ... m. Should have had an automatic shut-off--one detail we\noverlooked,\" Rodebush mused. \"The electricians can rebuild this stuff\nhere, though--that hole in the hull is something else again.\"\n\n\"I'll say it's something else,\" the grizzled Chief Engineer agreed.\n\"She's lost all her spherical strength--anchoring a tractor with this\nship now would turn her inside out. Back to the nearest Triplanetary\nshop for us, I would say.\"\n\n\"Come again, Chief!\" Cleveland advised the engineer. \"None of us would\nlive long enough to get there. We can't travel inertialess until the\nrepairs are made, so if they can't be made without very much traveling,\nit's just too bad.\"\n\n\"I don't see how we could support our jacks ...\" the engineer paused,\nthen went on: \"If you can't give me Mars or Tellus, how about some\nother planet? I don't care about atmosphere, or about anything but mass.\nI can stiffen her up in three or four days if I can sit down on\nsomething heavy enough to hold our jacks and presses; but if we have to\nrig up space-cradles around the ship herself it'll take a long\ntime--months, probably. Haven't got a spare planet on hand, have you?\"\n\n\"We might have, at that,\" Rodebush made surprising answer. \"A couple of\nseconds before we engaged we were heading toward a sun with at least two\nplanets. I was just getting ready to dodge them when we cut the\nneutralizers, so they should be fairly close somewhere--yes, there's the\nsun, right over there. Rather pale and small; but it's close,\ncomparatively speaking. We'll go back up into the control room and find\nout about the planets.\"\n\nThe strange sun was found to have three large and easily located\nchildren, and observation showed that the crippled space-ship could\nreach the nearest of these in about five days. Power was therefore fed\nto the driving projectors, and each scientist, electrician, and mechanic\nbent to the task of repairing the ruined generators; rebuilding them to\nhandle any load which the converters could possibly put upon them. For\ntwo days the _Boise_ drove on, then her acceleration was reversed, and\nfinally a landing was effected upon the forbidding, rocky soil of the\nstrange world.\n\nIt was larger than the Earth, and of a somewhat stronger gravitation.\nAlthough its climate was bitterly cold, even in its short daytime, it\nsupported a luxuriant but outlandish vegetation. Its atmosphere, while\nrich enough in oxygen and not really poisonous, was so rank with\nindescribably fetid vapors as to be scarcely breatheable. But these\nthings bothered the engineers not at all. Paying no attention to\ntemperature or to scenery and without waiting for chemical analysis of\nthe air, the space-suited mechanics leaped to their tasks; and in only a\nlittle more time than had been mentioned by the chief engineer the hull\nand giant frame of the super-ship were as staunch as of yore.\n\n\"All right, Skipper!\" came finally the welcome word. \"You might try her\nout with a fast hop around this world before you shove off in earnest.\"\n\nUnder the fierce blast of her projectors the vessel leaped ahead, and\ntime after time, as Rodebush hurled her mass upon tractor beam or\npressor, the engineers sought in vain for any sign of weakness. The\nstrange planet half girdled and the severest tests passed flawlessly,\nRodebush reached for his neutralizer switches. Reached and paused,\ndumbfounded, for a brilliant purple light had sprung into being upon his\npanel and a bell rang out insistently.\n\n\"What the hell!\" Rodebush shot out an exploring beam along the detector\nline and gasped. He stared, mouth open, then yelled:\n\n\"_Roger_ is here, rebuilding his planetoid! STATIONS ALL!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 17\n\nROGER CARRIES ON\n\n\nAs has been intimated, Gray Roger did not perish in the floods of Nevian\nenergy which destroyed his planetoid. While those terrific streamers of\nforce emanating from the crimson obscurity surrounding the amphibians'\nspace-ship were driving into his defensive screens he sat impassive and\nimmobile at his desk, his hard gray eyes moving methodically over his\ninstruments and recorders.\n\nWhen the clinging mantle of force changed from deep red into shorter and\neven shorter wave-lengths, however:\n\n\"Baxter, Hartkopf, Chatelier, Anandrusung, Penrose, Nishimura, Mirsky\n...\" he called off a list of names. \"Report to me here at once!\"\n\n\"The planetoid is lost,\" he informed his select group of scientists when\nthey had assembled, \"and we must abandon it in exactly fifteen minutes,\nwhich will be the time required for the robots to fill this first\nsection with our most necessary machinery and instruments. Pack each of\nyou one box of the things he most wishes to take with him, and report\nback here in not more than thirteen minutes. Say nothing to anyone\nelse.\"\n\nThey filed out calmly, and as they passed out into the hall Baxter,\nperhaps a trifle less case-hardened than his fellows, at least voiced a\nthought for those they were so brutally deserting.\n\n\"I say, it seems a bit thick to dash off this way and leave the rest of\nthem; but still, I suppose....\"\n\n\"You suppose correctly.\" Bland and heartless Nishimura filled in the\npause. \"A small part of the planetoid may be able to escape; which, to\nme at least, is pleasantly surprising news. It cannot carry all our men\nand mechanisms, therefore only the most important of both are saved.\nWhat would you? For the rest it is simply what you call 'the fortune of\nwar,' no?\"\n\n\"But the beautiful ...\" began the amorous Chatelier.\n\n\"Hush, fool!\" snorted Hartkopf. \"One word of that to the ear of Roger\nand you too left behind are. Of such non-essentials the Universe full\nis, to be collected in times of ease, but in times hard to be\ndisregarded. Und this is a time of _schrecklichkeit_ indeed!\"\n\nThe group broke up, each man going to his own quarters; to meet again in\nthe First Section a minute or so before the zero time. Roger's \"office\"\nwas now packed so tightly with machinery and supplies that but little\nroom was left for the scientists. The gray monstrosity still sat unmoved\nbehind his dials.\n\n\"But of what use is it, Roger?\" the Russian physicist demanded. \"Those\nwaves are of some ultra-band, of a frequency immensely higher than\nanything heretofore known. Our screens should not have stopped them for\nan instant. It is a mystery that they have held so long, and certainly\nthis single section will not be permitted to leave the planetoid without\nbeing destroyed.\"\n\n\"There are many things you do not know, Mirsky,\" came the cold and level\nanswer. \"Our screens, which you think are of your own devising, have\nseveral improvements of my own in the formulae, and would hold forever\nhad I the power to drive them. The screens of this section, being\nsmaller, can be held as long as will be found necessary.\"\n\n\"Power!\" the dumbfounded Russian exclaimed. \"Why, we have almost\ninfinite power--unlimited--sufficient for a lifetime of high\nexpenditure!\"\n\nBut Roger made no reply, for the time of departure was at hand. He\npressed down a tiny lever, and a mechanism in the power room threw in\nthe gigantic plunger switches which launched against the Nevians the\nstupendous beam which so upset the complacence of Nerado the\namphibian--the beam into which was poured recklessly every resource of\npower afforded by the planetoid, careless alike of burnout and of\nexhaustion. Then, while all of the attention of the Nevians and\npractically all of their maximum possible power output was being devoted\nto the neutralization of that last desperate thrust, the metal wall of\nthe planetoid opened and the First Section shot out into space.\nFull-driven as they were, Roger's screens flared white as he drove\nthrough the temporarily lessened attack of the Nevians; but in their\npreoccupation the amphibians did not notice the additional disturbance\nand the section tore on, unobserved and undetected.\n\nFar out in space, Roger raised his eyes from the instrument panel and\ncontinued the conversation as though it had not been interrupted.\n\n\"Everything is relative, Mirsky, and you have misused gravely the term\n'unlimited.' Our power was, and is, very definitely limited. True, it\nthen seemed ample for our needs, and is far superior to that possessed\nby the inhabitants of any solar system with which I am familiar; but the\nbeings behind that red screen, whoever they are, have sources of power\nas far above ours as ours are above those of the Solarians.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"That power, what is it?\"\n\n\"We have, then, the analyses of those fields recorded!\" came\nsimultaneous questions and exclamations.\n\n\"Their source of power is the intra-atomic energy of iron. Complete; not\nthe partial liberation incidental to the nuclear fission of such\nunstable isotopes as those of thorium, uranium, plutonium, and so on.\nTherefore much remains to be done before I can proceed with my plan--I\nmust have the most powerful structure in the macrocosmic universe.\"\n\nRoger thought for minutes, nor did any one of his minions break the\nsilence. Gharlane of Eddore did not have to wonder why such incredible\nadvancement could have been made without his knowledge: after the fact,\nhe knew. He had been and was still being hampered by a mind of power; a\nmind with which, in due time, he would come to grips.\n\n\"I now know what to do,\" he went on presently. \"In the light of what I\nhave learned, the losses of time, life, and treasure--even the loss of\nthe planetoid--are completely insignificant.\"\n\n\"But what can you do about it?\" growled the Russian.\n\n\"Many things. From the charts of the recorders we can compute their\nfields of force, and from that point it is only a step to their method\nof liberating the energy. We shall build robots. They shall build other\nrobots, who shall in turn construct another planetoid; one this time\nthat, wielding the theoretical maximum of power, will be suited to my\nneeds.\"\n\n\"And where will you build it? We are marked. Invisibility now is\nuseless. Triplanetary will find us, even if we take up an orbit beyond\nthat of Pluto!\"\n\n\"We have already left your Solarian system far behind. We are going to\nanother system; one far enough removed so that the spy-rays of\nTriplanetary will never find us, and yet one that we can reach in a\nreasonable length of time with the energies at our command. Some five\ndays will be required for the journey, however, and our quarters are\ncramped. Therefore make places for yourselves wherever you can, and\nlessen the tedium of those days by working upon whatever problems are\nmost pressing in your respective researches.\"\n\nThe gray monster fell silent, immersed in what thoughts no one knew, and\nthe scientists set out to obey his orders. Baxter, the British chemist,\nfollowed Penrose, the lantern-jawed, saturnine American engineer and\ninventor, as he made his way to the furthermost cubicle of the section.\n\n\"I say, Penrose, I'd like to ask you a couple of questions, if you don't\nmind?\"\n\n\"Go ahead. Ordinarily it's dangerous to be a cackling hen anywhere\naround _him_, but I don't imagine that he can hear anything here now.\nHis system must be pretty well shot to pieces. You want to know all I\nknow about Roger?\"\n\n\"Exactly so. You have been with him so much longer than I have, you\nknow. In some ways he impresses one as being scarcely human, if you know\nwhat I mean. Ridiculous, of course, but of late I have been wondering\nwhether he really _is_ human. He knows too much, about too many things.\nHe seems to be acquainted with many solar systems, to visit which would\nrequire lifetimes. Then, too, he has dropped remarks which would imply\nthat he actually saw things that happened long before any living man\ncould possibly have been born. Finally, he looks--well, peculiar--and\ncertainly does not act human. I have been wondering, and have been able\nto learn nothing about him; as you have said, such talk as this aboard\nthe planetoid was not advisable.\"\n\n\"You needn't worry about being paid your price; that's one thing. If we\nlive--and that was part of the agreement, you know--we will get what we\nsold out for. You will become a belted earl. I have already made\nmillions, and shall make many more. Similarly, Chatelier has had and\nwill have his women, Anandrusung and Nishimura their cherished revenges,\nHartkopf his power, and so on.\" He eyed the other speculatively, then\nwent on:\n\n\"I might as well spill it all, since I'll never have a better chance and\nsince you should know as much as the rest of us do. You're in the same\nboat with us and tarred with the same brush. There's a lot of gossip,\nthat may or may not be true, but I know one very startling fact. Here it\nis. My great-great-grandfather left some notes which, taken in\nconnection with certain things I myself saw on the planetoid, prove\nbeyond question that our Roger went to Harvard University at the same\ntime he did. Roger was a grown man then, and the elder Penrose noted\nthat he was marked, like this,\" and the American sketched a cabalistic\ndesign.\n\n\"What!\" Baxter exclaimed. \"An adept of North Polar Jupiter--_then_?\"\n\n\"Yes. That was before the First Jovian War, you know, and it was those\nmedicine-men--really high-caliber scientists--that prolonged that war\nso....\"\n\n\"But I say, Penrose, that's really a bit thick. When they were wiped out\nit was proved a lot of hocus-pocus....\"\n\n\"_If_ they were wiped out,\" Penrose interrupted in turn. \"Some of it may\nhave been hocus-pocus, but most of it certainly was not. I'm not asking\nyou to believe anything except that one fact; I'm just telling you the\nrest of it. But it is also a fact that those adepts knew things and did\nthings that take a lot of explaining. Now for the gossip, none of which\nis guaranteed. Roger is supposed to be of Tellurian parentage, and the\nstory is that his father was a moon-pirate, his mother a Greek\nadventuress. When the pirates were chased off the moon they went to\nGanymede, you know, and some of them were captured by the Jovians. It\nseems that Roger was born at an instant of time sacred to the adepts, so\nthey took him on. He worked his way up through the Forbidden Society as\nall adepts did, by various kinds of murder and job lots of assorted\ndeviltries, until he got clear to the top--the seventy-seventh\nmystery....\"\n\n\"The secret of eternal youth!\" gasped Baxter, awed in spite of himself.\n\n\"Right, and he stayed Chief Devil, in spite of all the efforts of all\nhis ambitious sub-devils to kill him, until the turning-point of the\nFirst Jovian War. He cut away then in a space-ship, and ever since then\nhe has been working--and working hard--on some stupendous plan of his\nown that nobody else has ever got even an inkling of. That's the story.\nTrue or not, it explains a lot of things that no other theory can touch.\nAnd now I think you'd better shuffle along; enough of this is a great\nplenty!\"\n\nBaxter went to his own cubby, and each man of gray Roger's cold-blooded\ncrew methodically took up his task. True to prediction, in five days a\nplanet loomed beneath them and their vessel settled through a reeking\natmosphere toward a rocky and forbidding plain. Then for hours they\nplunged along, a few thousand feet above the surface of that strange\nworld, while Roger with his analytical detectors sought the most\nfavorable location from which to wrest the materials necessary for his\nprogram of construction.\n\nIt was a world of cold; its sun was distant, pale, and wan. It had\nmonstrous forms of vegetation, of which each branch and member writhed\nand fought with a grotesque and horrible individual activity. Ever and\nanon a struggling part broke from its parent plant and darted away in\nindependent existence; leaping upon and consuming or being consumed by a\nfellow creature equally monstrous. This flora was of a uniform color, a\nlurid, sickly yellow. In form some of it was fern-like, some\ncactus-like, some vaguely tree-like; but it was all outrageous,\ninherently repulsive to all Solarian senses. And no less hideous were\nthe animal-like forms of life which slithered and slunk rapaciously\nthrough that fantastic pseudo-vegetation. Snake-like, reptile-like,\nbat-like, the creatures squirmed, crawled, and flew; each covered with a\ndankly oozing yellow hide and each motivated by twin common impulses--to\nkill and insatiably and indiscriminately to devour. Over this reeking\nwilderness Roger drove his vessel, untouched by its disgusting, its\nappalling ferocity and horror.\n\n\"There should be intelligence, of a kind,\" he mused, and swept the\nsurface of the planet with an exploring beam. \"Ah, yes, there is a city,\nof sorts,\" and in a few minutes the outlaws were looking down upon a\nmetal-walled city of roundly conical buildings.\n\nInside these structures and between and around them there scuttled\nformless blobs of matter, one of which Roger brought up into his vessel\nby means of a tractor. Held immovable by the beam it lay upon the floor,\na strangely extensile, amoeba-like, metal-studded mass of leathery\nsubstance. Of eyes, ears, limbs, or organs it apparently had none, yet\nit radiated an intensely hostile aura; a mental effluvium concentrated\nof rage and of hatred.\n\n\"Apparently the ruling intelligence of the planet,\" Roger commented.\n\"Such creatures are useless to us; we can build machines in half the\ntime that would be required for their subjugation and training. Still,\nit should not be permitted to carry back what it may have learned of\nus.\" As he spoke the adept threw the peculiar being out into the air and\ndispassionately rayed it out of existence.\n\n\"That thing reminds me of a man I used to know, back in Penobscot.\"\nPenrose was as coldly callous as his unfeeling master. \"The\nevenest-tempered man in town--mad all the time!\"\n\nEventually Roger found a location which satisfied his requirements of\nraw materials, and made a landing upon that unfriendly soil. Sweeping\nbeams denuded a great circle of life, and into that circle leaped\nrobots. Robots requiring neither rest nor food, but only lubricants and\npower; robots insensible alike to that bitter cold and to that noxious\natmosphere.\n\nBut the outlaws were not to win a foothold upon that inimical planet\neasily, nor were they to hold it without effort. Through the weird\nvegetation of the circle's bare edge there scuttled and poured along a\nhorde of the metal-studded men--if \"men\" they might be called--who,\nferocity incarnate, rushed the robot line. Mowed down by hundreds, still\nthey came on; willing, it seemed to spend any number of lives in order\nthat one living creature might once touch a robot with one outthrust\nmetallic stud. Whenever that happened there was a flash of lightning,\nthe heavy smoke of burning insulation, grease, and metal, and the robot\nwent down out of control. Recalling his remaining automatons, Roger sent\nout a shielding screen, against which the defenders of their planet\nraged in impotent fury. For days they hurled themselves and their every\nforce against that impenetrable barrier, then withdrew: temporarily\nstopped, but by no means acknowledging defeat.\n\nThen while Roger and his cohorts directed affairs from within their\ncomfortable and now sufficiently roomy vessel, there came into being\naround it an industrial city of metal peopled by metallic and insensate\nmechanisms. Mines were sunk, furnaces were blown in, smelters belched\nforth into the already unbearable air their sulphurous fumes, rolling\nmills and machine shops were built and were equipped; and as fast as new\nenterprises were completed additional robots were ready to man them. In\nrecord time the heavy work of girders, members, and plates was well\nunder way; and shortly thereafter light, deft, multi-fingered mechanisms\nbegan to build and to install the prodigious amount of precise machinery\nrequired by the vastness of the structure.\n\nAs soon as he was sure that he would be completely free for a\nsufficient length of time, Roger-Gharlane assembled, boiled down and\nconcentrated, his every mental force. He probed then, very gently, for\nwhatever it was that had been and was still blocking him. He found\nit--synchronized with it--and in the instant hurled against it the\nfiercest thrust possible for his Eddorian mind to generate: a bolt whose\ntwin had slain more than one member of Eddore's Innermost Circle; a bolt\nwhose energies, he had previously felt sure, would slay any living thing\nsave only His Ultimate Supremacy, the All-Highest of Eddore.\n\nNow, however, and not completely to his surprise, that blast of force\nwas ineffective; and the instantaneous riposte was of such intensity as\nto require for its parrying everything that Gharlane had. He parried it,\nhowever barely, and directed a thought at his unknown opponent.\n\n\"You, whoever you may be, have found out that you cannot kill me. No\nmore can I kill you. So be it. Do you still believe that you can keep me\nfrom remembering whatever it was that my ancestor was compelled to\nforget?\"\n\n\"Now that you have obtained a focal point we cannot prevent you from\nremembering; and merely to hinder you would be pointless. You may\nremember in peace.\"\n\nBack and back went Gharlane's mind. Centuries ... millenia ... cycles\n... eons. The trace grew dim, almost imperceptible, deeply buried\nbeneath layer upon layer of accretions of knowledge, experience, and\nsensation which no one of many hundreds of his ancestors had even so\nmuch as disturbed. But every iota of knowledge that any of his\nprogenitors had ever had was still his. However dim, however deeply\nburied, however suppressed and camouflaged by inimical force, he could\nnow find it.\n\nHe found it, and in the instant of its finding it was as though\nEnphilistor the Arisian spoke directly to him; as though the fused\nElders of Arisia tried--vainly now--to erase from his own mind all\nknowledge of Arisia's existence. The fact that such a race as the\nArisians had existed so long ago was bad enough. That the Arisians had\nbeen aware throughout all those ages of the Eddorians, and had been able\nto keep their own existence secret, was worse. The crowning fact that\nthe Arisians had had all this time in which to work unopposed against\nhis own race made even Gharlane's indomitable ego quail.\n\nThis was _important_. Such minor matters as the wiping out of\nnon-conforming cultures--the extraordinarily rapid growth of which was\nnow explained--must wait. Eddore must revise its thinking completely;\nthe pooled and integrated mind of the Innermost Circle must scrutinize\nevery fact, every implication and connotation, of this new-old\nknowledge. Should he flash back to Eddore, or should he wait and take\nthe planetoid, with its highly varied and extremely valuable contents?\nHe would wait; a few moments more would be a completely negligible\naddition to the eons of time which had already elapsed since action\nshould have been begun.\n\nThe rebuilding of the planetoid, then, went on. Roger had no reason to\nsuspect that there was anything physically dangerous within hundreds of\nmillions of miles. Nevertheless, since he knew that he could no longer\ndepend upon his own mental powers to keep him informed as to all that\nwas going on around him, it was his custom to scan, from time to time,\nall nearby space by means of ether-borne detectors. Thus it came about\nthat one day, as he sent out his beam, his hard gray eyes grew even\nharder.\n\n\"Mirsky! Nishimura! Penrose! Come here!\" he ordered, and showed them\nupon his plate an enormous sphere of steel, its offensive beams flaming\nviciously. \"Is there any doubt whatever in your minds as to the System\nto which that ship belongs?\"\n\n\"None at all--Solarian,\" replied the Russian. \"To narrow it still\nfurther, Triplanetarian. While larger than any I have ever seen before,\nits construction is unmistakable. They managed to trace us, and are\ntesting out their weapons before attacking. Do we attack or do we run\naway?\"\n\n\"If Triplanetarian, and it surely is, we attack,\" coldly. \"This one\nsection is armed and powered to defeat Triplanetary's entire navy. We\nshall take that ship, and shall add its slight resources to our own. And\nit may even be that they have picked up the three who escaped me ... I\nhave never been balked for long. Yes, we shall take that vessel. And\nthose three sooner or later. Except for the fact that their escape from\nme is a matter which should be corrected, I care nothing whatever about\neither Bradley or the woman. Costigan, however, is in a different\ncategory ... Costigan _handled_ me....\" Diamond-hard eyes glared\nbalefully at the urge of thoughts to a clean and normal mind\nunthinkable.\n\n\"To your posts,\" he ordered. \"The machines will continue to function\nunder their automatic controls during the short time it will require to\nabate this nuisance.\"\n\n\"One moment!\" A strange voice roared from the speakers. \"Consider\nyourselves under arrest, by order of the Triplanetary Council! Surrender\nand you shall receive impartial hearing; fight us and you shall never\ncome to trial. From what we have learned of Roger, we do not expect him\nto surrender, but if any of you other men wish to avoid immediate death,\nleave your vessel at once. We will come back for you later.\"\n\n\"Any of you wishing to leave this vessel have my full permission to do\nso,\" Roger announced, disdaining any reply to the challenge of the\n_Boise_. \"Any such, however, will not be allowed inside the planetoid\narea after the rest of us return from wiping out that patrol. We attack\nin one minute.\"\n\n\"Would not one do better by stopping on?\" Baxter, in the quarters of the\nAmerican, was in doubt as to the most profitable course to pursue. \"I\nshould leave immediately if I thought that that ship could win; but I do\nnot fancy that it can, do you?\"\n\n\"That ship? _One_ Triplanetary ship against _us_?\" Penrose laughed\nraucously. \"Do as you please. I'd go in a minute if I thought that there\nwas any chance of us losing; but there isn't, so I'm staying. I know\nwhich side _my_ bread's buttered on. Those cops are bluffing, that's\nall. Not bluffing exactly, either, because they'll go through with it as\nlong as they last. Foolish, but it's a way they have--they'll die trying\nevery time instead of running away, even when they know they're licked\nbefore they start. They don't use good judgment.\"\n\n\"None of you are leaving? Very well, you each know what to do,\" came\nRoger's emotionless voice. The stipulated minute having elapsed, he\nadvanced a lever and the outlaw cruiser slid quietly into the air.\n\nToward the poised _Boise_ Roger steered. Within range, he flung out a\nweapon new-learned and supposedly irresistible to any ferrous thing or\ncreature, the red converter-field of the Nevians. For Roger's analytical\ndetector had stood him in good stead during those frightful minutes in\nthe course of which the planetoid had borne the brunt of Nerado's\nsuper-human attack; in such good stead that from the records of those\ningenious instruments he and his scientists had been able to reconstruct\nnot only the generators of the attacking forces, but also the screens\nemployed by the amphibians in the neutralization of similar beams. With\na vastly inferior armament the smallest of Roger's vessels had defeated\nthe most powerful battleships of Triplanetary; what had he to fear in\nsuch a heavy craft as the one he now was driving, one so superlatively\narmed and powered? It was just as well for his peace of mind that he had\nno inkling that the harmless-looking sphere he was so blithely attacking\nwas in reality the much-discussed, half-mythical super-ship upon which\nthe Triplanetary Service had been at work so long; nor that its already\nunprecedented armament had been reenforced, thanks to that hated\nCostigan, with Roger's own every worthwhile idea, as well as with every\nweapon and defense known to that arch-Nevian, Nerado!\n\nUnknowing and contemptuous, Roger launched his converter field, and\ninstantly found himself fighting for his very life. For from Rodebush at\nthe controls down, the men of the _Boise_ countered with wave after wave\nand with salvo after salvo of vibratory and material destruction. No\nthought of mercy for the men of the pirate ship could enter their minds.\nThe outlaws had each been given a chance to surrender, and each had\nrefused it. Refusing, they knew, as the Triplanetarians knew and as all\nmodern readers know, meant that they were staking their lives upon\nvictory. For with modern armaments few indeed are the men who live\nthrough the defeat in battle of a war-vessel of space.\n\nRoger launched his field of red opacity, but it did not reach even the\n_Boise's_ screens. All space seemed to explode into violet splendor as\nRodebush neutralized it, drove it back with his obliterating zone of\nforce; but even that all-devouring zone could not touch Roger's\npeculiarly efficient screen. The outlaw vessel stood out, unharmed.\nUltra-violet, infra-red, pure heat, infra-sound, solid beams of\nhigh-tension, high-frequency stuff in whose paths the most stubborn\nmetals would be volatilized instantly, all iron-driven; every deadly and\ntorturing vibration known was hurled against that screen: but it, too,\nwas iron-driven, and it held. Even the awful force of the macro-beam was\ndissipated by it--reflected, hurled away on all sides in coruscating\ntorrents of blinding, dazzling energy. Cooper, Adlington, Spencer, and\nDutton hurled against it their bombs and torpedoes--and still it held.\nBut Roger's fiercest blasts and heaviest projectiles were equally\nimpotent against the force-shields of the super-ship. The adept, having\nno liking for a battle upon equal terms, then sought safety in flight,\nonly to be brought to a crashing, stunning halt by a massive tractor\nbeam.\n\n\"That must be that polycyclic screen that Conway reported on.\" Cleveland\nfrowned in thought. \"I've been doing a lot of work on that, and I think\nI've calculated an opener for it, Fred, but I'll have to have number ten\nprojector and the whole output of number ten power room. Can you let me\nplay with that much juice for a while? All right, Blake, tune her up to\nfifty-five thousand--there, hold it! Now, you other fellows, listen! I'm\ngoing to try to drill a hole through that screen with a hollow,\nquasi-solid beam; like a diamond drill cutting out a core. You won't be\nable to shove anything into the hole from outside the beam, so you'll\nhave to steer your cans out through the central orifice of number ten\nprojector--that'll be cold, since I'm going to use only the outer ring.\nI don't know how long I'll be able to hold the hole open, though, so\nshoot them along as fast as you can. Ready? Here goes!\"\n\nHe pressed a series of contacts. Far below, in number ten converter\nroom, massive switches drove home and the enormous mass of the vessel\nquivered under the terrific reaction of the newly-calculated,\nsemi-material beam of energy that was hurled out, backed by the\nmightiest of all the mighty converters and generators of Triplanetary's\nsuper-dreadnaught. That beam, a pipe-like hollow cylinder of intolerable\nenergy, flashed out, and there was a rending, tearing crash as it struck\nRoger's hitherto impenetrable wall. Struck and clung, grinding, boring\nin, while from the raging inferno that marked the circle of contact of\ncylinder and shield the pirate's screen radiated scintillating torrents\nof crackling, streaming sparks, lightning like in length and in\nintensity.\n\nDeeper and deeper the gigantic drill was driven. It was through! Pierced\nRoger's polycyclic screen; exposed the bare metal of Roger's walls! And\nnow, concentrated upon one point, flamed out in seemingly redoubled fury\nTriplanetary's raging beams--in vain. For even as they could not\npenetrate the screen, neither could they penetrate the wall of\nCleveland's drill, but rebounded from it in the cascaded brilliance of\nthwarted lightning.\n\n\"Oh, what a dumb-bell I am!\" groaned Cleveland. \"Why, oh _why_ didn't I\nhave somebody rig up a secondary SX7 beam on Ten's inner rings? Hop to\nit, will you, Blake, so that we'll have it in case they are able to stop\nthe cans?\"\n\nBut the pirates could not stop all of Triplanetary's projectiles, now\nhurrying along inside the pipe as fast as they could be driven. In fact,\nfor a few minutes gray Roger, knowing that he faced the first real\ndefeat of his long life, paid no attention to them at all, nor to any of\nhis useless offensive weapons: he struggled only to break away from the\nsavage grip of the _Boise's_ tractor rod. Futile. He could neither cut\nnor stretch that inexorably anchoring beam. Then he devoted his every\nresource to the closing of that unbelievable breach in his shield.\nEqually futile. His most desperate efforts resulted only in more\nfrenzied displays of incandescence along the curved surface of contact\nof that penetrant cylinder. And through that terrific conduit came\nspeeding package after package of destruction. Bombs, armor-piercing\nshells, gas shells of poisonous and corrosive fluids followed each other\nin close succession. The surviving scientists of the planetoid, expert\ngunners and ray-men all, destroyed many of the projectiles, but it was\nnot humanly possible to cope with them all. And the breach could not be\nforced shut against the all but irresistible force of Cleveland's\n\"opener\". And with all his power Roger could not shift his vessel's\nposition in the grip of Triplanetary's tractors sufficiently to bring a\nprojector to bear upon the super-ship along the now unprotected axis of\nthat narrow, but deadly tube.\n\nThus it was that the end came soon. A war-head touched steel plating and\nthere ensued a space-wracking explosion of atomic iron. Gaping wide,\nhelpless, with all defenses down, other torpedoes entered the stricken\nhulk and completed its destruction even before they could be recalled.\nAtomic bombs literally volatilized most of the pirate vessel; vials of\npure corrosion began to dissolve the solid fragments of her substance\ninto dripping corruption. Reeking gasses filled every cranny of\ncircumambient space as what was left of Roger's battle cruiser began the\nlong plunge to the ground. The super-ship followed the wreckage down,\nand Rodebush sent out an exploring spy-ray.\n\n\"... resistance was such that it was necessary to employ corrosive, and\nship and contents were completely disintegrated,\" he dictated, a little\nlater, into his vessel's log. \"While there were of course no remains\nrecognizable as human, it is certain that Roger and his last eleven men\ndied; since it is clear that the circumstances and conditions were such\nthat no life could possibly have survived.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt is true that the form of flesh which had been known as Roger was\ndestroyed. The solids and liquids of its substance were resolved into\ntheir component molecules or atoms. That which had energized that form\nof flesh, however, could not be harmed by any physical force, however\napplied. Therefore that which made Roger what he was; the essence which\nwas Gharlane of Eddore; was actually back upon his native planet even\nbefore Rodebush completed his study of what was left of the pirates'\nvessel.\n\nThe Innermost Circle met, and for a space of time which would have been\nvery long indeed for any Earthly mind those monstrous being considered\nas one multi-ply intelligence every newly-exposed phase and facet of the\ntruth. At the end, they knew the Arisians as well as the Arisians knew\nthem. The All-Highest then called a meeting of all the minds of Eddore.\n\n\"... hence it is clear that these Arisians, while possessing minds of\ntremendous latent capability, are basically soft, and therefore\ninefficient,\" he concluded. \"Not weak, mind you, but scrupulous and\nunrealistic; and it is by taking advantage of these characteristics that\nwe shall ultimately triumph.\"\n\n\"A few details, All-Highest, if Your Ultimate Supremacy would deign,\" a\nlesser Eddorian requested. \"Some of us have not been able to perceive at\nall clearly the optimum lines of action.\"\n\n\"While detailed plans of campaign have not yet been worked out, there\nwill be several main lines of attack. A purely military undertaking will\nof course be one, but it will not be the most important. Political\naction, by means of subversive elements and obstructive minorities, will\nprove much more useful. Most productive of all, however, will be the\noperations of relatively small but highly organized groups whose\nfunctions will be to negate, to tear down and destroy, every bulwark of\nwhat the weak and spineless adherents of Civilization consider the\nfinest things in life--love, truth, honor, loyalty, purity, altruism,\ndecency, and so on.\"\n\n\"Ah, love ... extremely interesting. Supremacy, this thing they call\nsex,\" Gharlane offered. \"What a silly, what a meaningless thing it is! I\nhave studied it intensively, but am not yet fully enough informed to\nsubmit a complete and conclusive report. I do know, however, that we can\nand will use it. In our hands, vice will become a potent weapon indeed.\nVice ... drugs ... greed ... gambling ... extortion ... blackmail ...\nlust ... abduction ... assassination ... ah-h-h!\"\n\n\"Exactly. There will be room, and need, for the fullest powers of every\nEddorian. Let me caution you all, however, that little or none of this\nwork is to be done by any of us in person. We must work through echelon\nupon echelon of higher and lower executives and supervisors if we are to\ncontrol efficiently the activities of the thousands of billions of\noperators which we must and will have at work. Each echelon of control\nwill be vastly greater in number than the one immediately above it, but\ncorrespondingly lower in the individual power of its component\npersonnel. The sphere of activity of each supervisor, however small or\ngreat, will be clearly and sharply defined. Rank, from the operators at\nplanetary-population levels up to and including the Eddorian\nDirectorate, will be a linear function of ability. Absolute authority\nwill be delegated. Full responsibility will be assumed. Those who\nsucceed will receive advancement and satisfaction of desire; those who\nfail will die.\n\n\"Since the personnel of the lower echelons will be of small value and\neasy of replacement, it is of little moment whether or not they become\ninvolved in reverses affecting the still lower echelons whose activities\nthey direct. The echelon immediately below us of Eddore, however--and\nincidentally, it is my thought that the Ploorans will best serve as our\nimmediate underlings--must never, under any conditions, allow any hint\nof any of its real business to become known either to any member of any\nlower echelon or to any adherent of Civilization. This point is vital;\neveryone here must realize that only in that way can our own safety\nremain assured, and must take pains to see to it that any violator of\nthis rule is put instantly to death.\n\n\"Those of you who are engineers will design ever more powerful\nmechanisms to use against the Arisians. Psychologists will devise and\nput into practice new methods and techniques, both to use against the\nable minds of the Arisians and to control the activities of mentally\nweaker entities. Each Eddorian, whatever his field or his ability, will\nbe given the task he is best fitted to perform. That is all.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd upon Arisia, too, while there was no surprise, a general conference\nwas held. While some of the young Watchmen may have been glad that the\nopen conflict for which they had been preparing so long was now about to\nbreak, Arisia as a whole was neither glad nor sorry. In the Great Scheme\nof Things which was the Cosmic All, this whole affair was an\ninfinitesimal incident. It had been foreseen. It had come. Each Arisian\nwould do to the fullest extent of his ability that which the very fact\nof his being an Arisian would compel him to do. It would pass.\n\n\"In effect, then, our situation has not really changed,\" Eukonidor\nstated, rather than asked, after the Elders had again spread their\nVisualization for public inspection and discussion. \"This killing, it\nseems, must go on. This stumbling, falling, and rising; this blind\ngroping; this futility; this frustration; this welter of crime,\ndisaster, and bloodshed. Why? It seems to me that it would be much\nbetter--cleaner, simpler, faster, more efficient, and involving\ninfinitely less bloodshed and suffering--for us to take now a direct and\nactive part, as the Eddorians have done and will continue to do.\"\n\n\"Cleaner, youth, yes; and simpler. Easier; less bloody. It would not,\nhowever, be better; or even good; because no end-point would ever be\nattained. Young civilizations advance only by overcoming obstacles. Each\nobstacle surmounted, each step of progress made, carries its suffering\nas well as its reward. We could negate the efforts of any echelon below\nthe Eddorians themselves, it is true. We could so protect and shield\neach one of our protege races that not a war would be waged and not a\nlaw would be broken. But to what end? Further contemplation will show\nyou immature thinkers that in such a case not one of our races would\ndevelop into what the presence of the Eddorians has made it necessary\nfor them to become.\n\n\"From this it follows that we would never be able to overcome Eddore;\nnor would our conflict with that race remain indefinitely at stalemate.\nGiven sufficient time during which to work against us, they will be able\nto win. However, if every Arisian follows his line of action as it is\nlaid out in this Visualization, all will be well. Are there any more\nquestions?\"\n\n\"None. The blanks which you may have left can be filled in by a mind of\nvery moderate power.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Look here, Fred.\" Cleveland called attention to the plate, upon which\nwas pictured a horde of the peculiar inhabitants of that ghastly planet,\nwreaking their frenzied electrical wrath upon everything within the\ncircle bared of native life by Roger's destructive beams. \"I was just\ngoing to suggest that we clean up the planetoid that Roger started to\nbuild, but I see that the local boys and girls are attending to it.\"\n\n\"Just as well, perhaps. I would like to stay and study these people a\nlittle while, but we must get back onto the trail of the Nevians,\" and\nthe _Boise_ leaped away into space, toward the line of flight of the\namphibians.\n\nThey reached that line and along it they traveled at full normal blast.\nAs they traveled their detecting receivers and amplifiers were reaching\nout with their utmost power; ultra-instruments capable of rendering\naudible any signal originating within many light-years of them, upon any\npossible communications band. And constantly at least two men, with\nevery sense concentrated in their ears, were listening to those\ninstruments.\n\nListening--straining to distinguish in the deafening roar of background\nnoise from the over-driven tubes any sign of voice or of signal:\n\nListening--while, millions upon millions of miles beyond even the\nprodigious reach of those ultra-instruments, three human beings were\neven then sending out into empty space an almost hopeless appeal for the\nhelp so desperately needed!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 18\n\nTHE SPECIMENS ESCAPE\n\n\nKnowing well that conversation with its fellows is one of the greatest\nneeds of any intelligent being, the Nevians had permitted the\nTerrestrial specimens to retain possession of their ultra-beam\ncommunicators. Thus it was that Costigan had been able to keep in touch\nwith his sweetheart and with Bradley. He learned that each had been\nplaced upon exhibition in a different Nevian city; that the three had\nbeen separated in response to an insistent popular demand for such a\ndistribution of the peculiar, but highly interesting creatures from a\ndistant solar system. They had not been harmed. In fact, each was\nvisited daily by a specialist, who made sure that his charge was being\nkept in the pink of condition.\n\nAs soon as he became aware of this condition of things Costigan became\nmorose. He sat still, drooped, and pined away visibly. He refused to\neat, and of the worried specialist he demanded liberty. Then, failing in\nthat as he knew he would fail, he demanded something to _do_. They\npointed out to him, reasonably enough, that in such a civilization as\ntheirs there was nothing he could do. They assured him that they would\ndo anything they could to alleviate his mental suffering, but that since\nhe was a museum piece he must see, himself, that he must be kept on\ndisplay for a short time. Wouldn't he please behave himself and eat, as\na reasoning being should? Costigan sulked a little longer, then wavered.\nFinally he agreed to compromise. He would eat and exercise if they would\nfit up a laboratory in his apartment, so that he could continue the\nstudies he had begun upon his own native planet. To this they agreed,\nand thus it came about that one day the following conversation was held:\n\n\"Clio? Bradley? I've got something to tell you this time. Haven't said\nanything before, for fear things might not work out, but they did. I\nwent on a hunger strike and made them give me a complete laboratory. As\na chemist I'm a damn good electrician; but luckily, with the sea-water\nthey've got here, it's a very simple thing to make....\"\n\n\"Hold on!\" snapped Bradley. \"Somebody may be listening in on us!\"\n\n\"They aren't. They can't, without my knowing it, and I'll cut off the\nsecond anybody tries to synchronize with my beam. To resume--making\nVee-Two is a very simple process, and I've got everything around here\nthat's hollow clear full of it....\"\n\n\"How come they let you?\" asked Clio.\n\n\"Oh, they don't know what I'm doing. They watched me for a few days, and\nall I did was make up and bottle the weirdest messes imaginable. Then I\nfinally managed to separate oxygen and nitrogen, after trying hard all\nof one day; and when they saw that I didn't know anything about either\none of them or what to do with them after I had them, they gave me up in\ndisgust as a plain dumb ape and haven't paid any attention to me since.\nSo I've got me plenty of kilograms of liquid Vee-Two, all ready to touch\noff. I'm getting out of here in about three minutes and a half, and I'm\ncoming over after you folks, in a new, iron-powered space-speedster that\nthey don't know I know anything about. They've just given it its final\ntests, and it's the slickest thing you ever saw.\"\n\n\"But Conway, dearest, you can't possibly rescue me,\" Clio's voice broke.\n\"Why, there are thousands of them, all around here. If you can get away,\ngo, dear, but don't....\"\n\n\"I said I was coming after you, and if I get away I'll be there. A good\nwhiff of this stuff will lay out a thousand of them just as easily as it\nwill one. Here's the idea. I've made a gas mask for myself, since I'll\nbe in it where it's thick, but you two won't need any. It's soluble\nenough in water so that three or four thicknesses of wet cloth over your\nnoses will be enough. I'll tell you when to wet down. We're going to\nbreak away or go out trying--there aren't enough amphibians between here\nand Andromeda to keep us humans cooped up like menagerie animals\nforever! But here comes my specialist with the keys to the city; time\nfor the overture to start. See you later!\"\n\nThe Nevian physician directed his key tube upon the transparent wall of\nthe chamber and an opening appeared, an opening which vanished as soon\nas he had stepped through it; Costigan kicked a valve open; and from\nvarious innocent tubes there belched forth into the water of the central\nlagoon and into the air over it a flood of deadly vapor. As the Nevian\nturned toward the prisoner there was an almost inaudible hiss and a tiny\njet of the frightful, outlawed stuff struck his open gills, just below\nhis huge, conical head. He tensed momentarily, twitched convulsively\njust once, and fell motionless to the floor. And outside, the streams of\navidly soluble liquefied gas rushed out into air and into water. It\nspread, dissolved, and diffused with the extreme mobility which is one\nof its characteristics; and as it diffused and was borne outward the\nNevians in their massed hundreds died. Died not knowing what killed\nthem, not knowing even that they died. Costigan, bitterly resentful of\nthe inhuman treatment accorded the three and fiercely anxious for the\nsuccess of his plan of escape, held his breath and, grimly alert,\nwatched the amphibians die. When he could see no more motion anywhere he\ndonned his gas-mask, strapped upon his back a large canister of the\npoison--his capacious pockets were already full of smaller\ncontainers--and two savagely exultant sentences escaped him.\n\n\"I am a poor, ignorant specimen of ape that can be let play with\napparatus, am I?\" he rasped, as he picked up the key tube of the\nspecialist and opened the door of his prison. \"They'll learn now that it\nain't safe to judge by the looks of a flea how far he can jump!\"\n\nHe stepped out through the opening into the water, and, burdened as he\nwas, made shift to swim to the nearest ramp. Up it he ran, toward a main\ncorridor. But ahead of him there was wafted a breath of dread Vee-Two,\nand where that breath went, went also unconsciousness--an\nunconsciousness which would deepen gradually into permanent oblivion\nsave for the prompt intervention of one who possessed, not only the\nnecessary antidote, but the equally important knowledge of exactly how\nto use it. Upon the floor of that corridor were strewn Nevians, who had\ndropped in their tracks. Past or over their bodies Costigan strode,\npausing only to direct a jet of lethal vapor into whatever branching\ncorridor or open door caught his eye. He was going to the intake of the\ncity's ventilation plant, and no unmasked creature dependent for life\nupon oxygen could bar his path. He reached the intake, tore the canister\nfrom his back, and released its full, vast volume of horrid contents\ninto the primary air stream of the entire city.\n\nAnd all throughout that doomed city Nevians dropped; quietly and without\na struggle, unknowing. Busy executives dropped upon their cushioned,\nflat-topped desks; hurrying travelers and messengers dropped upon the\nfloors of the corridors or relaxed in the noxious waters of the ways;\nlookouts and observers dropped before their flashing screens; central\noperators of communications dropped under the winking lights of their\npanels. Observers and centrals in the outlying sections of the city\nwondered briefly at the unwonted universal motionlessness and\nstagnation; then the racing taint in water and in air reached them, too,\nand they ceased wondering--forever.\n\nThen through those quiet halls Costigan stalked to a certain storage\nroom, where with all due precaution he donned his own suit of\nTriplanetary armor. Making an ungainly bundle of the other Solarian\nequipment stored there, he dragged it along behind him as he clanked\nback toward his prison, until he neared the dock at which was moored the\nNevian space-speedster which he was determined to take. Here, he knew,\nwas the first of many critical points. The crew of the vessel was\naboard, and, with its independent air-supply, unharmed. They had\nweapons, were undoubtedly alarmed, and were very probably highly\nsuspicious. They, too, had ultra-beams and might see him, but his very\ncloseness to them would tend to protect him from ultra-beam observation.\nTherefore he crouched tensely behind a buttress, staring through his\nspy-ray goggles, waiting for a moment when none of the Nevians would be\nnear the entrance, but grimly resolved to act instantly should he feel\nany touch of a spying ultra-beam.\n\n\"Here's where the pinch comes,\" he growled to himself. \"I know the\ncombinations, but if they're suspicious enough and act quick enough they\ncan seal that door on me before I can get it open, and then rub me out\nlike a blot; but ... ah!\"\n\nThe moment had arrived, before the touch of any revealing ray. He\ntrained the key-tube, the entrance opened, and through that opening in\nthe instant of its appearance there shot a brittle bulb of glass, whose\nbreaking meant death. It crashed into fragments against a metallic wall\nand Costigan, entering the vessel, consigned its erstwhile crew one by\none to the already crowded waters of the lagoon. He then leaped to the\ncontrols and drove the captured speedster through the air, to plunge it\ndown upon the surface of the lagoon beside the door of the isolated\nstructure which had for so long been his prison. Carefully he\ntransferred to the vessel the motley assortment of containers of\nVee-Two, and after a quick check-up to make sure that he had overlooked\nnothing, he shot his craft straight up into the air. Then only did he\nclose his ultra-wave circuits and speak.\n\n\"Clio, Bradley--I got away clean, without a bit of trouble. Now I'm\ncoming after you, Clio.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's wonderful that you got away, Conway!\" the girl exclaimed. \"But\nhadn't you better get Captain Bradley first? Then, if anything should\nhappen, he would be of some use, while I....\"\n\n\"I'll knock him into an outside loop if he does!\" the captain snorted,\nand Costigan went on:\n\n\"You won't need to. You come first, Clio, of course. But you're too far\naway for me to see you with my spy, and I don't want to use the\nhigh-powered beam of this boat for fear of detection; so you'd better\nkeep on talking, so that I can trace you.\"\n\n\"That's one thing I _am_ good at!\" Clio laughed in sheer relief. \"If\ntalking were music, I'd be a full brass band!\" and she kept up a flow of\ninconsequential chatter until Costigan told her that it was no longer\nnecessary; that he had established the line.\n\n\"Any excitement around there yet?\" he asked her then.\n\n\"Nothing unusual that I can see,\" she replied. \"Why? Should there be\nsome?\"\n\n\"I hope not, but when I made my getaway I couldn't kill them all, of\ncourse, and I thought maybe they might connect things up with my\njail-break and tell the other cities to take steps about you two. But I\nguess they're pretty well disorganized back there yet, since they can't\nknow who hit them, or what with, or why. I must have got about everybody\nthat wasn't sealed up somewhere, and it doesn't stand to reason that\nthose who are left can check up very closely for a while yet. But\nthey're nobody's fools--they'll certainly get conscious when I snatch\nyou, maybe before ... there, I see your city, I think.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do?\"\n\n\"Same as I did back there, if I can. Poison their primary air and all\nthe water I can reach....\"\n\n\"Oh, Conway!\" Her voice rose to a scream. \"They must know--they're all\ngetting out of the water and are rushing inside the buildings as fast as\nthey possibly can!\"\n\n\"I see they are,\" grimly. \"I'm right over you now, 'way up. Been\nlocating their primary intake. They've got a dozen ships around it, and\nhave guards posted all along the corridors leading to it; and _those\nguards are wearing masks_! They're clever birds, all right, those\namphibians--they know what they got back there and how they got it. That\nchanges things, girl! If we use gas here we won't stand a chance in the\nworld of getting old Bradley. Stand by to jump when I open that door!\"\n\n\"Hurry, dear! They are coming out here after me!\"\n\n\"Sure they are.\" Costigan had already seen the two Nevians swimming out\ntoward Clio's cage, and had hurled his vessel downward in a screaming\npower dive. \"You're too valuable a specimen for them to let you be\ngassed, but if they can get there before I do they're traveling fools!\"\n\nHe miscalculated slightly, so that instead of coming to a halt at the\nsurface of the liquid medium the speedster struck with a crash that\nhurled solid masses of water for hundreds of yards. But no ordinary\ncrash could harm that vessel's structure, her gravity controls were not\noverloaded, and she shot back to the surface; gallant ship and reckless\npilot alike unharmed. Costigan trained his key-tube upon the doorway of\nClio's cell, then tossed it aside.\n\n\"Different combination over here!\" he barked. \"Got to cut you out--lie\ndown in that far corner!\"\n\nHis hands flashed over the panel, and as Clio fell prone without\nhesitation or question a heavy beam literally blasted away a large\nportion of the roof of the structure. The speedster shot into the air\nand dropped down until she rested upon the tops of opposite walls; walls\nstill glowing, semi-molten. The girl piled a stool upon the table and\nstood upon it, reached upward and seized the mailed hands extended\ndownward toward her. Costigan heaved her up into the vessel with a\npowerful jerk, slammed the door shut, leaped to the controls, and the\nspeedster darted away.\n\n\"Your armor's in that bundle there. Better put it on, and check your\nLewistons and pistols--no telling what kind of jams we'll get into,\" he\nsnapped, without turning. \"Bradley, start talking ... all right, I've\ngot your line. Better get your wet rags ready and get organized\ngenerally--every second will count by the time we get there. We're\ncoming so fast that our outer plating's white hot, but it may not be\nfast enough, at that.\"\n\n\"It isn't fast enough, quite,\" Bradley announced, calmly. \"They're\ncoming out after me now.\"\n\n\"Don't fight them and probably they won't paralyze you. Keep on\ntalking, so that I can find out where they take you.\"\n\n\"No good, Costigan.\" The voice of the old spacehound did not reveal a\nsign of emotion as he made his dread announcement. \"They have it all\nfigured out. They're not taking any chances at all--they're going to\nparal....\" His voice broke off in the middle of the word.\n\nWith a bitter imprecation Costigan flashed on the powerful ultra-beam\nprojector of the speedster and focused the plate upon Bradley's prison;\ncareless now of detection, since the Nevians were already warned. Upon\nthat plate he watched the Nevians carry the helpless body of the captain\ninto a small boat, and continued to watch as they bore it into one of\nthe largest buildings of the city. Up a series of ramps they took the\nstill form, placing it finally upon a soft couch in an enormous and\nheavily guarded central hall. Costigan turned to his companion, and even\nthrough the helmets she could see plainly the white agony of his\nexpression. He moistened his lips and tried twice to speak--tried and\nfailed; but he made no move either to cut off their power or to change\ntheir direction.\n\n\"Of course,\" she approved steadily. \"We are going through. I know that\nyou _want_ to run with me, but if you actually did it I would never want\nto see you or hear of you again, and you would hate me forever.\"\n\n\"Hardly that.\" The anguish did not leave his eyes and his voice was\nhoarse and strained, but his hands did not vary the course of the\nspeedster by so much as a hair's breadth. \"You're the finest little\nfellow that ever waved a plume, and I would love you no matter what\nhappened. I'd trade my immortal soul to the devil if it would get you\nout of this mess, but we're both in it up to our necks and we can't back\nout now. If they kill him we beat it--he and I both knew that it was on\nthe chance of that happening that I took you first--but as long as all\nthree of us are alive it's all three or none.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" she said again, as steadily, thrilled this time to the\ndepths of her being by the sheer manhood of him who had thus simply\nvoiced his Code; a man of such fiber that neither love of life nor his\ninfinitely greater love for her could make him lower its high standard.\n\"We are going through. Forget that I am a woman. We are three human\nbeings, fighting a world full of monsters. I am simply one of us three.\nI will steer your ship, fire your projectors, or throw your bombs. What\ncan I do best?\"\n\n\"Throw bombs,\" he directed, briefly. He knew what must be done were they\nto have even the slightest chance of winning clear. \"I'm going to blast\na hole down into that auditorium, and when I do you stand by that port\nand start dropping bottles of perfume. Throw a couple of big ones right\ndown the shaft I make, and the rest of them most anywhere, after I cut\nthe wall open. They'll do good wherever they hit, land or water.\"\n\n\"But Captain Bradley--he'll be gassed, too.\" Her fine eyes were\ntroubled.\n\n\"Can't be helped. I've got the antidote, and it'll work any time under\nan hour. That'll be lots of time--if we aren't gone in less than ten\nminutes we'll be staying here. They're bringing in platoons of militia\nin full armor, and if we don't beat those boys to it we're in for plenty\nof grief. All right--start throwing!\"\n\nThe speedster had come to a halt directly over the imposing edifice\nwithin which Bradley was incarcerated, and a mighty beam had flared\ndownward, digging a fiery well through floor after floor of stubborn\nmetal. The ceiling of the amphitheater was pierced. The beam expired.\nDown into that assembly hall there dropped two canisters of Vee-Two, to\ncrash and to fill its atmosphere with imperceptible death. Then the beam\nflashed on again, this time at maximum power, and with it Costigan\nburned away half of the entire building. Burned it away until room above\nroom gaped open, shelf-like, to outer atmosphere; the great hall now\nresembling an over-size pigeon-hole surrounded by smaller ones. Into\nthat largest pigeon-hole the speedster darted, and cushioned desks and\nbenches crashed down; crushed flat under its enormous weight as it came\nto rest upon the floor.\n\nEvery available guard had been thrown into that room, regardless of\ncustomary occupation or of equipment. Most of them had been ordinary\nwatchmen, not even wearing masks, and all such were already down. Many,\nhowever, were masked, and a few were dressed in full armor. But no\nportable armor could mount defenses of sufficient power to withstand the\nawful force of the speedster's weapons, and one flashing swing of a\nprojector swept the hall almost clear of life.\n\n\"Can't shoot very close to Bradley with this big beam, but I'll mop up\non the rest of them by hand. Stay here and cover me, Clio!\" Costigan\nordered, and went to open the port.\n\n\"I can't--I won't!\" Clio replied instantly. \"I don't know the controls\nwell enough. I'd kill you or Captain Bradley, sure; but I _can_ shoot,\nand I'm going to!\" and she leaped out, close upon his heels.\n\nThus, flaming Lewiston in one hand and barking automatic in the other,\nthe two mailed figures advanced toward Bradley, now doubly helpless;\nparalyzed by his enemies and gassed by his friends. For a time the\nNevians melted away before them, but as they approached more nearly the\ncouch upon which the captain was they encountered six figures encased in\narmor fully as capable as their own. The beams of the Lewistons\nrebounded from that armor in futile pyrotechnics, the bullets of the\nautomatics spattered and exploded impotently against it. And behind that\nsingle line of armored guards were massed perhaps twenty unarmored, but\nmasked, soldiers; and scuttling up the ramps leading into the hall were\ncoming the platoons of heavily armored figures which Costigan had\npreviously seen.\n\nDecision instantly made, Costigan ran back toward the speedster, but he\nwas not deserting his companions.\n\n\"Keep the good work up!\" he instructed the girl as he ran. \"I'll pick\nthose jaspers off with a pencil and then stand off the bunch that's\ncoming while you rub out the rest of that crew there and drag Bradley\nback here.\"\n\nBack at the control panel, he trained a narrow, but intensely dense\nbeam--quasi-solid lightning--and one by one the six armored figures\nfell. Then, knowing that Clio could handle the remaining opposition, he\ndevoted his attention to the reenforcements so rapidly approaching from\nthe sides. Again and again the heavy beam lashed out, now upon this\nside, now upon that, and in its flaming path Nevians disappeared. And\nnot only Nevians--in the incredible energy of that beam's blast floor,\nwalls, ramps, and every material thing vanished in clouds of thick and\nbrilliant vapor. The room temporarily clear of foes, he sprang again to\nClio's assistance, but her task was nearly done. She had \"rubbed out\"\nall opposition and, tugging lustily at Bradley's feet, had already\ndragged him almost to the side of the speedster.\n\n\"At-a-girl, Clio!\" cheered Costigan, as he picked up the burly captain\nand tossed him through the doorway. \"Highly useful, girl of my dreams,\nas well as ornamental. In with you, and we'll go places!\"\n\nBut getting the speedster out of the now completely ruined hall proved\nto be much more of a task than driving it in had been, for scarcely had\nCostigan closed his locks than a section of the building collapsed\nbehind them, cutting off their retreat. Nevian submarines and airships\nwere beginning to arrive upon the scene, and were beaming the building\nviciously in an attempt to entrap or to crush the foreigners in its\nruins Costigan managed finally to blast his way out, but the Nevians\nhad had time to assemble in force and he was met by a concentrated storm\nof beams and of metal from every inimical weapon within range.\n\nBut not for nothing had Conway Costigan selected for his dash for\nliberty the craft which, save only for the two immense interstellar\ncruisers, was the most powerful vessel ever built upon red Nevia. And\nnot for nothing had he studied minutely and to the last, least detail\nevery item of its controls and of its armament during wearily long days\nand nights of solitary imprisonment. He had studied it under test, in\naction, and at rest; studied it until he knew thoroughly its every\npossibility--and what a ship it was! The atomic-powered generators of\nhis shielding screens handled with ease the terrific load of the\nNevians' assault, his polycyclic screens were proof against any material\nprojectile, and the machines supplying his offensive weapons with power\nwere more than equal to their tasks. Driven now at full rating those\nfrightful beams lashed out against the Nevians blocking the way, and\nunder their impacts her screens flared brilliantly through the spectrum\nand went down. And in the instant of their failure the enemy vessel was\nliterally blown into nothingness--no unprotected metal, however\nresistant, could exist for a moment in the pathway of those iron-driven\ntornadoes of pure energy.\n\nShip after ship of the Nevians plunged toward the speedster in\ndesperately suicidal attempts to ram her down, but each met the same\nflaming fate before it could reach its target. Then from the grouped\nsubmarines far below there reached up red rods of force, which seized\nthe space-ship and began relentlessly to draw her down.\n\n\"What are they doing that for, Conway? _They_ can't fight us!\"\n\n\"They don't want to fight us. They want to hold us, but I know what to\ndo about that, too,\" and the powerful tractor rods snapped as a plane of\npure force knifed through them. Upward now at the highest permissible\nvelocity the speedster leaped, and past the few ships remaining above\nher she dodged; nothing now between her and the freedom of boundless\nspace.\n\n\"You did it, Conway; you did it!\" Clio exulted. \"Oh, Conway, you're just\nsimply wonderful!\"\n\n\"I haven't done it yet,\" Costigan cautioned her. \"The worst is yet to\ncome. Nerado. He's why they wanted to hold us back, and why I was in\nsuch a hurry to get away. That boat of his is bad medicine, girl, and\nwe want to put plenty of kilometers behind us before he gets started.\"\n\n\"But do you think he will chase us?\"\n\n\"_Think_ so? I _know_ so! The mere facts that we are rare specimens and\nthat he told us that we were going to stay there all the rest of our\nlives would make him chase us clear to Lundmark's Nebula. Besides that,\nwe stepped on their toes pretty heavily before we left. We know\naltogether too much now to be let get back to Tellus; and finally,\nthey'd all die of acute enlargement of the spleen if we get away with\nthis prize ship of theirs. I hope to tell you they'll chase us!\"\n\nHe fell silent, devoting his whole attention to his piloting, driving\nhis craft onward at such velocity that its outer plating held steadily\nat the highest point of temperature compatible with safety. Soon they\nwere out in open space, hurtling toward the sun under the drive of every\npossible watt of power, and Costigan took off his armor and turned\ntoward the helpless body of the captain.\n\n\"He looks so ... so ... so _dead_, Conway! Are you really sure that you\ncan bring him to?\"\n\n\"Absolutely. Lots of time yet. Just three simple squirts in the right\nplaces will do the trick.\" He took from a locked compartment of his\narmor a small steel box, which housed a surgeon's hypodermic and three\nvials. One, two, three, he injected small, but precisely measured\namounts of the fluids into the three vital localities, then placed the\ninert form upon a deeply cushioned couch.\n\n\"There! That'll take care of the gas in five or six hours. The paralysis\nwill wear off long before that, so he'll be all right when he wakes up;\nand we're going away from here with everything we can put out. I've done\neverything I know how to do, for the present.\"\n\nThen only did Costigan turn and look down, directly into Clio's eyes.\nWide, eloquent blue eyes that gazed back up into his, tender and\nunafraid; eyes freighted with the oldest message of woman to chosen man.\nHis hard young face softened wonderfully as he stared at her; there were\ntwo quick steps and they were in each other's arms. Lips upon eager\nlips, blue eyes to gray, motionless they stood clasped in ecstasy;\nthinking nothing of the dreadful past, nothing of the fearful future,\nconscious only of the glorious, wonderful present.\n\n\"Clio mine ... darling ... girl, girl, how I love you!\" Costigan's deep\nvoice was husky with emotion. \"I haven't kissed you for seven thousand\nyears! I don't rate you, by a million steps; but if I can just get you\nout of this mess, I swear by all the gods of interplanetary space....\"\n\n\"You needn't, lover. Rate _me_? Good Heavens, Conway! It's just the\nother way....\"\n\n\"Stop it!\" he commanded in her ear. \"I'm still dizzy at the idea of your\nloving me at all, to say nothing of loving me _this_ way! But you do,\nand that's all I ask, here or hereafter.\"\n\n\"Love you? _Love_ you!\" Their mutual embrace tightened and her low voice\nthrilled brokenly as she went on: \"Conway dearest ... I can't say a\nthing, but you know.... Oh, Conway!\"\n\nAfter a time Clio drew a long and tremulous, but supremely happy breath\nas the realities of their predicament once more obtruded themselves upon\nher consciousness. She released herself gently from Costigan's arms.\n\n\"Do you really think that there is a chance of us getting back to the\nEarth, so that we can be together ... always?\"\n\n\"A chance, yes. A probability, no,\" he replied, unequivocally. \"It\ndepends upon two things. First, how much of a start we got on Nerado.\nHis ship is the biggest and fastest thing I ever saw, and if he strips\nher down and drives her--which he will--he'll catch us long before we\ncan make Tellus. On the other hand, I gave Rodebush a lot of data, and\nif he and Lyman Cleveland can add it to their own stuff and get that\nsuper-ship of ours rebuilt in time, they'll be out here on the prowl;\nand they'll have what it takes to give even Nerado plenty of argument.\nNo use worrying about it, anyway. We won't know anything until we can\ndetect one or the other of them, and then will be the time to do\nsomething about it.\"\n\n\"If Nerado catches us, will you....\" She paused.\n\n\"Rub you out? I will not. Even if he does catch us, and takes us back to\nNevia, I won't. There's lots more time coming onto the clock. Nerado\nwon't hurt either of us badly enough to leave scars, either physical,\nmental, or moral. I'd kill you in a second if it were Roger; he's dirty.\nHe's mean--he's thoroughly bad. But Nerado's a good enough old scout, in\nhis way. He's big and he's clean. You know, I could really like that\nfish if I could meet him on terms of equality sometime?\"\n\n\"_I_ couldn't!\" she declared vigorously. \"He's crawly and scaly and\nsnaky; and he smells so ... so....\"\n\n\"So rank and fishy?\" Costigan laughed deeply. \"Details, girl; mere\ndetails. I've seen people who looked like money in the bank and who\nsmelled like a bouquet of violets that you couldn't trust half the\nlength of Nerado's neck.\"\n\n\"But look what he did to us!\" she protested. \"And they weren't trying to\nrecapture us back there; they were trying to kill us.\"\n\n\"That was perfectly all right, what he did and what they did--what else\ncould they have done?\" he wanted to know. \"And while you're looking,\nlook at what we did to them--plenty, I'd say. But we all had it to do,\nand neither side will blame the other for doing it. He's a square\nshooter, I tell you.\"\n\n\"Well, maybe, but I don't like him a bit, and let's not talk about him\nany more. Let's talk about us. Remember what you said once, when you\nadvised me to 'let you lay,' or whatever it was?\" Woman-like, she wished\nto dip again lightly into the waters of pure emotion, even though she\nhad such a short time before led the man out of their profoundest\ndepths. But Costigan, into whose hard life love of woman had never\nbefore entered, had not yet recovered sufficiently from his soul-shaking\nplunge to follow her lead. Inarticulate, distrusting his newly found\nsupreme happiness, he must needs stay out of those enchanted waters or\nplunge again. And he was afraid to plunge--diffident, still deeming\nhimself unworthy of the miracle of this wonder-girl's love--even though\nevery fiber of his being shrieked its demand to feel again that slender\nbody in his arms. He did not consciously think those thoughts. He acted\nthem without thinking; they were prime basics in that which made Conway\nCostigan what he was.\n\n\"I do remember, and I still think it's a sound idea, even though I am\ntoo far gone now to let you put it into effect,\" he assured her, half\nseriously. He kissed her, tenderly and reverently, then studied her\ncarefully. \"But you look as though you'd been on a Martian picnic. When\ndid you eat last?\"\n\n\"I don't remember, exactly. This morning, I think.\"\n\n\"Or maybe last night, or yesterday morning? I thought so! Bradley and I\ncan eat anything that's chewable, and drink anything that will pour, but\nyou can't. I'll scout around and see if I can't fix up something that\nyou'll be able to eat.\"\n\nHe rummaged through the store-rooms, emerging with sundry viands from\nwhich he prepared a highly satisfactory meal.\n\n\"Think you can sleep now, sweetheart?\" After supper, once more within\nthe circle of Costigan's arms, Clio nodded her head against his\nshoulder.\n\n\"Of course I can, dear. Now that you are with me, out here alone, I'm\nnot a bit afraid any more. You will get us back to Earth some way,\nsometime; I just know that you will. Good-night, Conway.\"\n\n\"Good-night, Clio ... little sweetheart,\" he whispered, and went back to\nBradley's side.\n\nIn due time the captain recovered consciousness, and slept. Then for\ndays the speedster flashed on toward our distant solar system; days\nduring which her wide-flung detector screens remained cold.\n\n\"I don't know whether I'm afraid they'll hit something or afraid that\nthey won't,\" Costigan remarked more than once, but finally those tenuous\nsentinels did in fact encounter an interfering vibration. Along the\ndetector line a visibeam sped, and Costigan's face hardened as he saw\nthe unmistakable outline of Nerado's interstellar cruiser, far behind\nthem.\n\n\"Well, a stern chase always was a long one,\" Costigan said finally. \"He\ncan't catch us for plenty of days yet ... now what?\" for the alarms of\nthe detectors had broken out anew. There was still another point of\ninterference to be investigated. Costigan traced it, and there, almost\ndead ahead of them, between them and their sun, nearing them at the\nincomprehensible rate of the sum of the two vessels' velocities, came\nanother cruiser of the Nevians!\n\n\"Must be the sister-ship, coming back from our System with a load of\niron,\" Costigan deduced. \"Heavily loaded as she is, we may be able to\ndodge her; and she's coming so fast that if we can stay out of her range\nwe'll be all right--he won't be able to stop for probably three or four\ndays. But if our super-ship is anywhere in these parts, now's the time\nfor her to rally 'round!\"\n\nHe gave the speedster all the side-thrust she would take; then, putting\nevery available communicator tube behind a tight beam, he aimed it at\nSol and began sending out a long-continued call to his fellows of the\nTriplanetary Service.\n\nNearer and nearer the Nevian flashed, trying with all her power to\nintercept the speedster; and it soon became evident that, heavily laden\nthough she was, she could make enough sideway to bring her within range\nat the time of meeting.\n\n\"Of course, they've got partial neutralization of inertia, the same as\nwe have,\" Costigan cogitated, \"and by the way he's coming I'd say that\nhe had orders to blow us out of the ether--he knows as well as we do\nthat he can't capture us alive at anything like the relative velocities\nwe've got now. I can't give her any more side thrust without overloading\nthe gravity controls, so overloaded they've got to be. Strap down, you\ntwo, because they may go out entirely!\"\n\n\"Do you think that you can pull away from them, Conway?\" Clio was\nstaring in horrified fascination into the plate, watching the pictured\nvessel increase in size, moment by moment.\n\n\"I don't know whether I can or not, but I'm going to try. Just in case\nwe don't, though, I'm going to keep on yelling for help. In solid? All\nright, boat, DO YOUR STUFF!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 19\n\nGIANTS MEET\n\n\n\"Check your blast, Fred, I think that I hear something trying to come\nthrough!\" Cleveland called out, sharply. For days the _Boise_ had torn\nthrough the illimitable reaches of empty space, and now the long vigil\nof the keen-eared listeners was to be ended. Rodebush cut off his power,\nand through the crackling roar of tube noise an almost inaudible voice\nmade itself heard.\n\n\"... all the help you can give us. Samms--Cleveland--Rodebush--anybody\nof Triplanetary who can hear me, listen! This is Costigan, with Miss\nMarsden and Captain Bradley, heading for where we think the sun is, from\nright ascension about six hours, declination about plus fourteen\ndegrees. Distance unknown, but probably a good many light-years. Trace\nmy call. One Nevian ship is overhauling us slowly, another is coming\ntoward us from the sun. We may or may not be able to dodge it, but we\nneed all the help you can give us. Samms--Rodebush--Cleveland--anybody\nof Triplanetary....\"\n\nEndlessly the faint, faint voice went on, but Rodebush and Cleveland\nwere no longer listening. Sensitive ultra-loops had been swung, and\nalong the indicated line shot Triplanetary's super-ship at a velocity\nwhich she had never before even approached; the utterly\nincomprehensible, almost incalculable velocity attained by inertialess\nmatter driven through an almost perfect vacuum by the _Boise's_ maximum\nprojector blasts--a blast which would lift her stupendous normal tonnage\nagainst a gravity five times that of Earth. At the full frightful\nmeasure of that velocity the super-ship literally annihilated distance,\nwhile ahead of her the furiously driven spy-ray beam fanned out in quest\nof the three Triplanetarians who were calling for help.\n\n\"Got any idea how fast we're going?\" Rodebush demanded, glancing up for\nan instant from the observation plate. \"We should be able to see him,\nsince we could hear him, and our range is certainly as great as anything\nhe can have.\"\n\n\"No. Can't figure velocity without any reliable data on how many atoms\nof matter exist per cubic meter out here.\" Cleveland was staring at the\ncalculator. \"It's constant, of course, at the value at which the\nfriction of the medium is equal to our thrust. Incidentally, we can't\nhold it too long. We're running a temperature, which shows that we're\nstepping along faster than anybody ever computed before. Also, it points\nout the necessity for something that none of us ever anticipated needing\nin an open-space drive--refrigerators or radiating wall-shields or\nrepellers or something of the sort. But to get back to our\nvelocity--taking Throckmorton's estimates it figures somewhere near the\norder of magnitude of ten to the twenty-seventh. Fast enough, anyway, so\nthat you'd better bend an eye on that plate. Even after you see them you\nwon't know where they really are, because we don't know any of the\nvelocities involved--our own, theirs, or that of the beam--and we may be\nright on top of them.\"\n\n\"Or, if we happen to be outrunning the beam, we won't see them at all.\nThat makes it nice piloting.\"\n\n\"How are you going to handle things when we get there?\"\n\n\"Lock to them and take them aboard, if we're in time. If not, if they\nare fighting already--_there they are_!\"\n\nThe picture of the speedster's control room flashed upon the speaker.\n\n\"Hi, Fritz! Hi, Cleve! Welcome to our city! Where are you?\"\n\n\"We don't know,\" Cleveland snapped back, \"and we don't know where you\nare, either. Can't figure anything without data. I see you're still\nbreathing air. Where are the Nevians? How much time have we got yet?\"\n\n\"Not enough, I'm afraid. By the looks of things they will be within\nrange of us in a couple of hours, and you haven't even touched our\ndetector screen yet.\"\n\n\"A couple of _hours_!\" In his relief Cleveland shouted the words.\n\"That's time to burn--we can be just about out of the Galaxy in\nthat....\" He broke off at a yell from Rodebush.\n\n\"Broadcast, Spud, BROADCAST!\" the physicist had cried, as Costigan's\nimage had disappeared utterly from his plate.\n\nHe cut off the _Boise's_ power, stopping her instantaneously in\nmid-space, but the connection had been broken. Costigan could not\npossibly have heard the orders to change his beam signal to a broadcast,\nso that they could pick it up; nor would it have done any good if he had\nheard and had obeyed. So immeasurably great had been their velocity that\nthey had flashed past the speedster and were now unknown thousands--or\nmillions--of miles beyond the fugitives they had come so far to help;\nfar beyond the range of any possible broadcast. But Cleveland understood\ninstantly what had happened. He now had a little data upon which to\nwork, and his hands flew over the keys of the calculator.\n\n\"Back blast, at maximum, seventeen seconds!\" he directed crisply. \"Not\nexact, of course, but that will put us close enough so that we can find\n'em with our detectors.\"\n\nFor the calculated seventeen seconds the super-ship retraced her path,\nat the same awful speed with which she had come so far. The blast\nexpired and there, plainly limned upon the observation plates, was the\nNevian speedster.\n\n\"As a computer, you're good, Cleve,\" Rodebush applauded. \"So close that\nwe can't use the neutralizers to catch him. If we use one dyne of drive\nwe'll overshoot a million kilometers before I could snap the switch.\"\n\n\"And yet he's so far away and going so fast that if we keep our inertia\non it'll take all day at full blast to overtake--no, wait a minute--we\ncould _never_ catch him.\" Cleveland was puzzled. \"What to do? Shunt in a\npotentiometer?\"\n\n\"No, we don't need it.\" Rodebush turned to the transmitter. \"Costigan!\nWe are going to take hold of you with a very light tractor--a tracer,\nreally--and whatever you do, DON'T CUT IT, or we can't reach you in\ntime. It may look like a collision, but it won't be--we'll just touch\nyou, without even a jar.\"\n\n\"A tractor--inertialess?\" Cleveland wondered.\n\n\"Sure. Why not?\" Rodebush set up the beam at its absolute minimum of\npower and threw in the switch.\n\nWhile hundreds of thousands of miles separated the two vessels and the\nattractor was exerting the least effort of which it was capable, yet the\nsuper-ship leaped toward the smaller craft at a pace which covered the\nintervening distance in almost no time at all. So rapidly were the\nobjectives enlarging upon the plates that the automatic focusing devices\ncould scarcely function rapidly enough to keep them in place. Cleveland\nflinched involuntarily and seized his arm-rests in a spasmodic clutch as\nhe watched this, the first inertialess space-approach; and even\nRodebush, who knew better than anyone else what to expect, held his\nbreath and swallowed hard at the unbelievable rate at which the two\nvessels were rushing together.\n\nAnd if these two, who had rebuilt the super-ship, could hardly control\nthemselves, what of the three in the speedster, who knew nothing\nwhatever of the wonder-craft's potentialities? Clio, staring into the\nplate with Costigan, uttered one piercing shriek as she sank her fingers\ninto his shoulders. Bradley swore a mighty deep-space oath and braced\nhimself against certain annihilation. Costigan stared for an instant,\nunable to believe his eyes; then, in spite of the warning, his hand\ndarted toward the studs which would cut the beam. Too late. Before his\nflying fingers could reach the buttons the _Boise_ was upon them; had\nstruck the speedster in direct central impact. Moving at the full\nmeasure of her unthinkable velocity though the super-ship was in the\ninstant of impact, yet the most delicate recording instruments of the\nspeedster could not detect the slightest shock as the enormous globe\nstruck the comparatively tiny torpedo and clung to it; accommodating\ninstantaneously and effortlessly her own terrific pace to that of the\nsmaller and infinitely slower craft. Clio sobbed in relief and Costigan,\none arm around her, sighed hugely.\n\n\"Hey, you spacelugs!\" he cried. \"Glad to see you, and all that, but you\nmight as well kill a man outright as scare him to death! So _that's_ the\nsuper-ship, huh? _Some_ ship!\"\n\n\"Hi-ya, Murf! Hi, Spud!\" came from the speaker.\n\n\"Murf? Spud? How come?\" Clio, practically recovered now, glanced upward\nquestioningly. It was plain that she did not quite know whether or not\nto like the nicknames which the rescuers were calling her Conway.\n\n\"My middle name is Murphy, so they've called me things like that ever\nsince I was so high.\" Costigan indicated a length of approximately\ntwelve inches. \"And now you'll probably live long enough--I hope--to\nhear me called a lot worse stuff than that.\"\n\n\"Don't _talk_ that way--we're safe now, Con ... Spud? It's nice that\nthey like you so much--but they would, of course.\" She snuggled even\ncloser, and both listened to what Rodebush was saying.\n\n\"... realize myself that it would look so bad; it scared me as much as\nit did anybody. Yes, this is IT. She really works--thanks more than\nsomewhat to Conway Costigan, by the way. But you had better transfer.\nIf you'll get your things....\"\n\n\"'Things' is good!\" Costigan laughed, and Clio giggled sunnily.\n\n\"We've made so many transfers already that what you see is all we've\ngot,\" Bradley explained. \"We'll bring ourselves, and we'll hurry. That\nNevian is coming up fast.\"\n\n\"Is there anything on this ship you fellows want?\" Costigan asked.\n\n\"There may be, but we haven't any locks big enough to let her inside and\nwe haven't time to study her now. You might leave her controls in\nneutral, so that we can calculate her position if we should want her\nlater on.\"\n\n\"All right.\" The three armor-clad figures stepped into the _Boise's_\nopen lock, the tractor beam was cut off, and the speedster flashed away\nfrom the now stationary super-ship.\n\n\"Better let formalities go for a while,\" Captain Bradley interrupted the\ngeneral introductions taking place. \"I was scared out of nine years'\ngrowth when I saw you coming at us, and maybe I've still got the humps;\nbut that Nevian is coming up fast, and if you don't already know it I\ncan tell you that she's _no_ light cruiser.\"\n\n\"That's so, too,\" Costigan agreed. \"Have you fellows got enough stuff so\nthat you think you can take him? You've got the legs on him, anyway--you\ncan certainly run if you want to!\"\n\n\"Run?\" Cleveland laughed. \"We have a bone of our own to pick with that\nship. We licked her to a standstill once, until we burned out a set of\ngenerators, and since we got them fixed we've been chasing her all over\nspace. We were chasing her when we picked up your call. See there? She's\ndoing the running.\"\n\nThe Nevian was running, in truth. Her commander had seen and had\nrecognized the great vessel which had flashed out of nowhere to the\nrescue of the three fugitives from Nevia; and, having once been at grips\nwith that vengeful super-dreadnaught, he had little stomach for another\nencounter. Therefore his side-thrust was now being exerted in the\nopposite direction; he was frankly trying to put as much distance as\npossible between himself and Triplanetary's formidable warship. In vain.\nA light tractor was clamped on and the _Boise_ flashed up to close range\nbefore Rodebush restored her inertia and Cleveland brought the two\nvessels relatively to rest by increasing gradually his tractor's pull.\nAnd this time the Nevian could not cut the tractor. Again that shearing\nplane of force bit into it and tore at it, but it neither yielded nor\nbroke. The rebuilt generators of Number Four were designed to carry the\nload, and they carried it. And again Triplanetary's every mighty weapon\nwas brought into play.\n\nThe \"cans\" were thrown, ultra-and infra-beams were driven, the furious\nmacro-beam gnawed hungrily at the Nevian's defenses; and one by one\nthose defenses went down. In desperation the enemy commander threw his\nevery generator behind a polycyclic screen; only to see Cleveland's even\nmore powerful drill bore relentlessly through it. After that puncturing,\nthe end came soon. A secondary SX7 beam was now in place on mighty Ten's\ninner rings, and one fierce blast blew a hole completely through the\nNevian cruiser. Into that hole entered Adlington's terrific bombs and\ntheir gruesome fellows, and where they entered, life departed. All\ndefenses vanished, and under the blasts of the _Boise's_ batteries, now\nunopposed, the metal of the Nevian vessel exploded into a widely\nspreading cloud of vapor. Sparkling vapor, with perhaps here and there a\ndroplet or two of material which had been only liquefied.\n\nSo passed the sister-ship, and Rodebush turned his plates upon the\nvessel of Nerado. But that highly intelligent amphibian had seen all\nthat had occurred. He had long since given over the pursuit of the\nspeedster, and he did not rush in to do hopeless battle beside his\nfellow Nevians against the Tellurians. His analytical detectors had\nwritten down each detail of every weapon and of every screen employed;\nand even while prodigious streamers of force were raving out from his\nvessel, braking her terrific progress and swinging her around in an\nimmense circle back toward far Nevia, his scientists and mechanics were\ndoubling and redoubling the power of his already Titanic installations,\nto match and if possible to overmatch those of Triplanetary's\nsuper-dreadnaught.\n\n\"Do we kill him now or do we let him suffer a while longer?\" Costigan\ndemanded.\n\n\"I don't think so, yet,\" Rodebush replied. \"Would you, Cleve?\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" said Cleveland, grimly, reading the other's thought and\nagreeing with it. \"Let him pilot us to Nevia; we might not be able to\nfind it without a guide. While we're at it we want to so pulverize that\ncrowd that if they never come near the Solarian system again they'll\nthink it's twenty minutes too soon.\"\n\nThus it was that the _Boise_, increasing her few dynes of driving force\nat a rate just sufficient to match her quarry's acceleration, pursued\nthe Nevian ship. Apparently exerting every effort, she never came quite\nwithin range of the fleeing raider; yet never was she so far behind that\nthe Nevian space-ship was not in clear register upon her observation\nplates.\n\nNor was Nerado alone in strengthening his vessel. Costigan knew well and\nrespected highly the Nevian scientist-captain, and at his suggestion\nmuch time was spent in reenforcing the super-ship's armament to the\niron-driven limit of theoretical and mechanical possibility.\n\nIn mid-space, however, the Nevian slowed down.\n\n\"What gives?\" Rodebush demanded of the group at large. \"Not turn-over\ntime already, is it?\"\n\n\"No.\" Cleveland shook his head. \"Not for at least a day yet.\"\n\n\"Cooking up something on Nevia, is my guess,\" Costigan put in. \"If I\nknow that lizard at all, he wired ahead--specifications for the\nwelcoming committee. We're getting there too fast, so he's stalling.\nCheck?\"\n\n\"Check.\" Rodebush agreed. \"But there's no use of us waiting, if you're\nsure you know which one of those stars up ahead is Nevia. Do you,\nCleve?\"\n\n\"Definitely.\"\n\n\"The only other thing is, then, shall we blow them out of the ether\nfirst?\"\n\n\"You might try,\" Costigan remarked. \"That is, if you're damned sure that\nyou can run if you have to.\"\n\n\"Huh? _Run_?\" demanded Rodebush.\n\n\"Just that. It's spelled R-U-N, run. I know those freaks better than you\ndo. Believe me, Fritz, they've got what it takes.\"\n\n\"Could be, at that,\" Rodebush admitted. \"We'll play it safe.\"\n\nThe _Boise_ leaped upon the Nevian, every weapon aflame. But, as\nCostigan had expected, Nerado's vessel was completely ready for any\nemergency. And, unlike her sister-ship, she was manned by scientists\nwell versed in the fundamental theory of the weapons with which they\nfought. Beams, rods, and lances of energy flamed and flared; planes and\npencils cut, slashed, and stabbed; defensive screens glowed redly or\nflashed suddenly into intensely brilliant, coruscating incandescence.\nCrimson opacity struggled sullenly against violet curtain of\nannihilation. Material projectiles and torpedoes were launched under\nfull beam control; only to be exploded harmlessly in mid-space, to be\nblasted into nothingness, or to disappear innocuously against\nimpenetrable polycyclic screens. Even Cleveland's drill was ineffective.\nBoth vessels were equipped completely with iron-driven mechanisms; both\nwere manned by scientists capable of wringing the highest possible\nmeasure of power from their installations. Neither could harm the other.\n\nThe _Boise_ flashed away; reached Nevia in minutes. Down into the\ncrimson atmosphere she dropped, down toward the city which Costigan knew\nwas Nerado's home port.\n\n\"Hold up a bit!\" Costigan cautioned, sharply. \"There's something down\nthere that I don't like!\"\n\nAs he spoke there shot upward from the city a multitude of flashing\nballs. The Nevians had mastered the secret of the explosive of the\nfishes of the greater deeps, and were launching it in a veritable storm\nagainst the Tellurian visitor.\n\n\"Those?\" asked Rodebush, calmly. The detonating balls of destruction\nwere literally annihilating even the atmosphere beyond the polycyclic\nscreen, but that barrier was scarcely affected.\n\n\"No. That.\" Costigan pointed out a hemispherical dome which, redly\ntranslucent, surrounded a group of buildings towering high above their\nneighbors. \"Neither those high towers nor those screens were there the\nlast time I was in this town. Nerado _was_ stalling for time, and that's\nwhat they're doing down there--that's all those fire-balls are for. Good\nsign, too--they aren't ready for us yet. We'd better take 'em while the\ntaking's good. If they _were_ ready for us, our play would be to get out\nof here while we're all in one piece.\"\n\nNerado had been in touch with the scientists of his city; he had been\ninstructing them in the construction of converters and generators of\nsuch weight and power that they could crush even the defenses of the\nsuper-ship. The mechanisms were not, however, ready; the entirely\nunsuspected possibilities of speed inherent in absolute inertialessness\nhad not entered into Nerado's calculations.\n\n\"Better drop a few cans down onto that dome, fellows,\" Rodebush\nsuggested to his gunners.\n\n\"We can't,\" came Adlington's instant reply. \"No use trying it--that's a\npolycyclic screen. Can you drill it? If you can, I've got a real bomb\nhere--that special we built--that will do the trick if you can protect\nit from them until it gets down into the water.\"\n\n\"I'll try it,\" Cleveland answered, at a nod from the physicist. \"I\ncouldn't drill Nerado's polycyclics, but I couldn't use any momentum on\nhim. Couldn't ram him--he fell back with my thrust. But that screen down\nthere can't back away from us, so maybe I can work on it. Get your\nspecial ready. Hang on, everybody!\"\n\nThe _Boise_ looped upward, and from an altitude of miles dove straight\ndown through a storm of force-balls, beams, and shells; a dive checked\nabruptly as the hollow tube of energy which was Cleveland's drill\nsnarled savagely down ahead of her and struck the shielding hemisphere\nwith a grinding, lightning-spitting shock. As it struck, backed by all\nthe enormous momentum of the plunging space-ship and driven by the full\npower of her prodigious generators it bored in, clawing and gouging\nviciously through the tissues of that rigid and unyielding barrier of\npure energy. Then, mighty drill and plunging mass against iron-driven\nwall, eye-tearing and furiously spectacular warfare was waged.\n\nWell it was for Triplanetary that day that its super-ship carried ample\nsupplies of allotropic iron; well it was that her originally Gargantuan\nconverters and generators had been doubled and quadrupled in power on\nthe long Nevian way! For that ocean-girdled fortress was powered to\nwithstand any conceivable assault--but the _Boise's_ power and momentum\nwere now inconceivable; and every watt and every dyne was solidly behind\nthat hellishly flaming, that voraciously tearing, that irresistibly\nravening cylinder of energy incredible!\n\nThrough the Nevian shield that cylinder gnawed its frightful way, and\ndown its protecting length there drove Adlington's \"Special\" bomb.\n\"Special\" it was indeed; so great of girth that it could barely pass\nthrough the central orifice of Ten's mighty projector, so heavily\ncharged with sensitized atomic iron that its detonation upon any planet\nwould not have been considered for an instant if that planet's integrity\nmeant anything to its attackers. Down the shielding pipe of force the\n\"Special\" screamed under full propulsion, and beneath the surface of\nNevia's ocean it plunged.\n\n\"Cut!\" yelled Adlington, and as the scintillating drill expired the\nbomber pressed his detonating switch.\n\nFor moments the effect of the explosion seemed unimportant. A dull, low\nrumble was all that was to be heard of a concussion that jarred red\nNevia to her very center; and all that could be seen was a slow heaving\nof the water. But that heaving did not cease. Slowly, _so_ slowly it\nseemed to the observers now high in the heavens, the waters rose up and\nparted; revealing a vast chasm blown deep into the ocean's rocky bed.\nHigher and higher the lazy mountains of water reared; effortlessly to\npick up, to smash, to grind into fragments, and finally to toss aside\nevery building, every structure, every scrap of material substance\npertaining to the whole Nevian city.\n\nFlattened out, driven backward for miles, the buffeted waters were\npressed, leaving exposed bare ground and broken rock where once had been\nthe ocean's busy floor. Tremendous blasts of incandescent gas raved\nupward, jarring even the enormous mass of the super-ship poised so high\nabove the site of the explosion. Then the displaced millions of tons of\nwater rushed to make even more complete the already total destruction of\nthe city. The raging torrents poured into that yawning cavern, filled\nit, and piled mountainously above it; receding and piling up, again and\nagain; causing tidal waves which swept a full half of Nevia's mighty,\nwatery globe. That city was silenced--forever.\n\n\"MY ... GOD!\" Cleveland was the first to break the awed, the stunned,\nsilence. He licked his lips. \"But we had it to do ... and at that, it's\nnot as bad as what they did to Pittsburgh--they would have evacuated all\nexcept military personnel.\"\n\n\"Of course ... what next?\" asked Rodebush. \"Look around, I suppose, to\nsee if they have any more....\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Conway--no! Don't let them!\" Clio was sobbing openly. \"I'm\ngoing to my room and crawl under the bed--I'll see that sight all the\nrest of my life!\"\n\n\"Steady, Clio.\" Costigan's arm tightened around her. \"We'll have to\nlook, but we won't find any more. One--if they could have finished\nit--would have been enough.\"\n\nAgain and again the _Boise_ circled the world. No more super-powered\ninstallations were being built. And, surprisingly enough, the Nevians\nmade no demonstration of hostility.\n\n\"I wonder why?\" Rodebush mused. \"Of course, we aren't attacking them,\neither, but you'd think ... do you suppose that they are waiting for\nNerado?\"\n\n\"Probably.\" Costigan paused in thought. \"We'd better wait for him, too.\nWe can't leave things this way.\"\n\n\"But if we can't force engagement ... a stalemate....\" Cleveland's voice\nwas troubled.\n\n\"We'll do _something_!\" Costigan declared. \"This thing has got to be\nsettled, some way or other, before we leave here. First, try talking.\nI've got an idea that ... anyway, it can't do any harm, and I know that\nhe can hear and understand you.\"\n\nNerado arrived. Instead of attacking, his ship hung quietly poised, a\nmile or two away from the equally undemonstrative _Boise_. Rodebush\ndirected a beam.\n\n\"Captain Nerado, I am Rodebush of Triplanetary. What do you wish to do\nabout this situation?\"\n\n\"I wish to talk to you.\" The Nevian's voice came clearly from the\nspeaker. \"You are, I now perceive, a much higher form of life than any\nof us had thought possible; a form perhaps as high in evolution as our\nown. It is a pity that we did not take the time for a full meeting of\nminds when we first neared your planet, so that much life, both\nTellurian and Nevian, might have been spared. But what is past cannot be\nrecalled. As reasoning beings, however, you will see the futility of\ncontinuing a combat in which neither is capable of winning victory over\nthe other. You may, of course, destroy more of our Nevian cities, in\nwhich case I should be compelled to go and destroy similarly upon your\nEarth; but, to reasoning minds, such a course would be sheerest\nstupidity.\"\n\nRodebush cut the communicator beam.\n\n\"Does he mean it?\" he demanded of Costigan. \"It sounds perfectly\nreasonable, but....\"\n\n\"But fishy!\" Cleveland broke in. \"Altogether too reasonable to be true!\"\n\n\"He means it. He means every word of it,\" Costigan assured his fellows.\n\"I had an idea that he would take it that way. That's the way they are.\nReasonable; passionless. Funny--they lack a lot of things that we have;\nbut they've got stuff that I wish more of us Tellurians had, too. Give\nme the plate--I'll talk for Triplanetary,\" and the beam was restored.\n\n\"Captain Nerado,\" he greeted the Nevian commander. \"Having been with you\nand among your people, I know that you mean what you say and that you\nspeak for your race. Similarly, I believe that I can speak for the\nTriplanetary Council--the governing body of three of the planets of our\nsolar system--in saying that there is no need for any more conflict\nbetween our peoples. I also was compelled by circumstances to do certain\nthings which I now wish could be undone; but as you have said, the past\nis past. Our two races have much to gain from each other by friendly\nexchanges of materials and of ideas, while we can expect nothing except\nmutual extermination if we elect to continue this warfare. I offer you\nthe friendship of Triplanetary. Will you release your screens and come\naboard to sign a treaty?\"\n\n\"My screens are down. I will come.\" Rodebush likewise cut off his power,\nalthough somewhat apprehensively, and a Nevian lifeboat entered the main\nairlock of the _Boise_.\n\nThen, at a table in the control room of Triplanetary's first super-ship,\nthere was written the first Inter-Systemic Treaty. Upon one side were\nthe three Nevians; amphibious, cone-headed, loop-necked, scaly,\nfour-legged things to us monstrosities: upon the other were human\nbeings; air-breathing, round-headed, short-necked, smooth-bodied,\ntwo-legged creatures equally monstrous to the fastidious Nevians. Yet\neach of these representatives of two races so different felt respect for\nthe other race increase within him minute by minute as the conversation\nwent on.\n\nThe Nevians had destroyed Pittsburgh, but Adlington's bomb had blown an\nimportant Nevian city completely out of existence. One Nevian vessel had\nwiped out a Triplanetarian fleet; but Costigan had depopulated one\nNevian city, had seriously damaged another, and had beamed down many\nNevian ships. Therefore loss of life and material damage could be\nbalanced off. The Solarian System was rich in iron, to which the Nevians\nwere welcome; red Nevia possessed abundant stores of substances which\nupon Earth were either rare or of vital importance, or both. Therefore\ncommerce was to be encouraged. The Nevians had knowledges and skills\nunknown to Earthly science, but were entirely ignorant of many things\ncommonplace to us. Therefore interchange of students and of books was\nhighly desirable. And so on.\n\nThus was signed the Triplanetario-Nevian Treaty of Eternal Peace. Nerado\nand his two companions were escorted ceremoniously to their vessel, and\nthe _Boise_ took off inertialess for Earth, bearing the good news that\nthe Nevian menace was no more.\n\nClio, now a hardened spacehound, immune even to the horrible nausea of\ninertialessness, wriggled lithely in the curve of Costigan's arm and\nlaughed up at him.\n\n\"You can talk all you want to, Conway Murphy Spud Costigan, but I don't\nlike them the least little bit. They give me goose-bumps all over. I\nsuppose that they are really estimable folks; talented, cultured, and\neverything; but just the same I'll bet that it will be a long, long time\nbefore anybody on Earth will really, truly _like_ them!\"\n\n\n\n\n   war of the galaxies\n\n   Eddore and Arisia fought desperately to control the Universe. The\n   ultimate battleground was a tiny, backward planet in a remote\n   galaxy--Earth.\n\n   And only a few Earthmen knew of the titanic struggle--and of the\n   strange, decisive role they were to play in the war of the\n   super-races.\n\n   Here is the beginning of \"Doc\" Smith's famous Lensman series--the\n   first of the celebrated novels that set a pattern for science\n   fiction.\n\n   BE SURE TO GET EVERY ONE OF THE LENSMAN NOVELS AS THEY GO ON SALE!\n\n   ONE OF THE GREATEST SCIENCE FICTION SERIES EVER WRITTEN!\n\n   A PYRAMID BOOK 95\u00a2 Printed in U.S.A.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Triplanetary, by Edward Elmer Smith\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TRIPLANETARY ***\n\n***** This file should be named 32706-8.txt or 32706-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/2/7/0/32706/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Graeme Mackreth and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
