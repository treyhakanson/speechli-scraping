The most noticeable one, of course, is the fact\nthat there are almost twice as many pages as in the September copy.\nBut our improvements do not end there--not by a long shot. Not only\nhas the circulation been doubled, but we have a new policy. Starting\nwith this issue, we will present a story every month (maybe more than\none) by Clark Ashton Smith, H. P. Lovecraft, August W. Derleth, and\nother top-notchers in the field of weird fiction. You science-fiction\nfans are probably wondering by the import of the last sentence why we\nwill not print science-fiction. Well, here's the reason. In the\nSCIENCE FICTION DIGEST we have a fan magazine for those\nscientifictionally inclined, which also presents gems of this type\nstory by Arthur J. Burks, Ray Palmer, and others. We feel that the\nweird fans should also have a magazine for themselves--hence THE\nFANTASY FAN. But don't get discouraged, you science-fiction guzzlers,\nwe have dozens of excellent articles composed just for you. Although\nTHE FANTASY FAN will present no science-fiction stories, we certainly\nwill continue to give absorbing columns, articles and departments that\nwill make each issue well worth a dime to you. You won't want to miss\nthe rest of Schwartz's \"How to Collect Fantasy Fiction,\" or Ackerman's\nstory of his A-1 collection, or the Club News or the Famous Fans\ndepartment, or the Boiling Point, or Science Fiction in English\nMagazines by Tucker, or the super-excellent material we have on hand\nbesides--dozens of articles of humor, satire, information, absorbing\ninterest--the type of article that only the science fiction fan can\nderive full enjoyment from. So, while THE FANTASY FAN will lean toward\nthe weird angle, it will be worth the while of every science fiction\nfan to continue to be a reader. Furthermore--through years of\nexperience (well, a month, anyway), we have learned that a great many\nweird fans--we could almost say a majority--are also readers of\nscience fiction and vice versa. After all, both science fiction and\nweird tales are fantastic, aren't they? They both are based on the\nhighly improbable, and they both stimulate the imagination. It is a\nrare fan that does not like both. The scientifically inclined reader\nmay not like weird tales; those that only want to be horrified and\nterrorized may not like science fiction; but those who want their\nimaginations stimulated like both.\n\nLet us remind you again, and inform the new readers, that this is\nprimarily a magazine for the fans, of the fans, and by the fans--the\nfan, the whole fan, and nothing but the fan. (We hope that by this\ntime you realize that we publish a FAN magazine). But all foolishness\naside, we want you to run the magazine. Tell us what you like and what\nyou don't like. As many letters as possible will be published in \"Our\nReaders Say\" department. We will always abide by the wishes of the\nmajority, and very often act upon the opinions of a single reader--try\nout his ideas to see how the rest of the readers like them. Make\nbelieve that you are an associate editor--criticize us \"to the hairy\nlimit\"--or tell us how good you think we are (we are not modest). If\nyou feel as though you have the ability to compose suitable articles\nfor publication in THE FANTASY FAN, send them in for our\nconsideration, and if we find them acceptable, you will be paid for\nthem in copies of THE FANTASY FAN--in cash as soon as possible. THE\nFANTASY FAN is still running on a deficit. Subscribe now, if you have\nnot already done so, and insure yourself of a bigger and better\nmagazine in the future.\n\nThe following departments: \"This Month's Cash Contest\"--\"Penpals\nWanted\"--and the Questionnaire have been discontinued because of lack\nof support and enthusiasm on the part of our readers. The\n\"Conglamitorial,\" and \"About Authors\" and similar departments may be\nleft out once in awhile to make place for material of greater merit.\n\nThe feature of next month's issue will be \"The Other Gods,\" by H. P.\nLovecraft--a picturesque and weird story well up to the standard of\nLovecraft's best, and far surpassing the general run of weird tale. We\nare extremely fortunate in being able to secure such stories. The\nNovember issue will also contain a poem by Clark Ashton Smith, the\ncontinuation of all continued in this issue (including another one of\nthe \"Annals of the Jinns\" and will present many new and interesting\nfeatures.\n\nYours for spreading the gospel of weird and science fiction.\n\nThe Editor\n\n\n\n\nOUR READERS SAY\n\n\n\"I have read the first issue of 'The Fantasy Fan' with much interest.\nGood work! I like your departments, and hope you will be able to\nexpand them, particularly those devoted to information about fantastic\nstories.\n\n\"'The Boiling Point' is going to be a great department. I was\ninterested by the article on 'Science Fiction in English Magazines' by\nBob Tucker. I predict that 'The Fantasy Fan' will be a success. With\nall best wishes\"--Clark Ashton Smith\n\n\"Vol. 1, No. 1, looks to me very much what the younger science fiction\ndevotee wants. Later on it might be a good idea to use matter of\ninterest to weird tales enthusiasts--articles on the classics of weird\nliterature, and information concerning weird magazines.\"--H. P.\nLovecraft\n\nWe'll wager Mr. Lovecraft is well satisfied with this issue. It\nincludes everything he asked for and then some. It is no longer for\nthe \"younger science fiction enthusiast,\" but for all lovers of the\nfantastic.\n\n\"I received the first issue of 'The Fantasy Fan' this morning and was\nindeed pleased with it.\"--August W. Derleth\n\n\"I recently received the first issue of 'The Fantasy Fan' and I want\nto congratulate you on your initial number. If future issues live up\nto the promise of the first one, you have nothing to fear. Your\nventure should be a successful one.\n\n\"Being essentially a collector, I enjoyed the articles 'How to Collect\nFantasy Fiction' and 'Science Fiction in English Magazines.' I hope\nMr. Tucker will be a more or less constant contributor to 'The Fantasy\nFan' with information regarding stories in the English magazines.\n\n\"I have only one fault to find with the first number of 'The Fantasy\nFan' and that's Forrest J. Ackerman. Can't you get along without him?\nIsn't it bad enough to find his letters appearing in all of the other\nmagazines without having to endure more of him in 'The Fantasy Fan?'\nMaybe he is the most active science fiction fan, but I wish he would\nconfine his activities to California. If you simply have to have him,\nplease keep his outbursts to a minimum. I wonder if the 'World's most\nactive science fiction fan;' 'The demon letter writer' realizes how\ntiresome and boring his continual out-pourings may become.\n\n\"Once more permit me to congratulate you on your efforts. I am looking\nforward with considerable interest to future issues. With best\nluck.\"--H. Koenig\n\nYou will be pleased to hear that Mr. Tucker has promised us a column\non English science fiction every month. The second in the series\nappear in this issue.\n\nOf course, we cannot take sides with you as to whether Mr. Ackerman's\n'outbursts' are boring. That is for the readers to decide. Yours is\nthe first unfavorable comment we have had upon Mr. Ackerman's efforts,\nand we feel that the majority of the readers enjoy his articles.\n\n\"Your first issue certainly satisfies! Like Chesterfields, huh? Of\ncourse, I don't know--I don't smoke. But I've just read TFF thru, and\nit's a dandy first number.\n\n\"A real good idea, that, of reprinting the article about author\nKostkos from the paper. He sounds a real stf'ist.\n\n\"If you want to know, I think that 'Science Fiction Alphabet' poem by\nAllen Glasser is great. I got a laugh out of every letter, and am\ninterested in seeing what happens from N to Z. Also, I greatly enjoyed\nhis 'Earthling Spurns Martian,' newspaper-of-the-future account--but\nEfjay Akkamin for the terrestrial! From Ockermann to McKerman\nmisspellings have ranged (and, yes, someone even addressed me Mr.\nStaples, once), but really----\"--Forrest J. Ackerman\n\n\"I enjoyed the first issue of 'The Fantasy Fan' very much, your\nfeatures and news items were well chosen and well written. There is\nlittle room for improvement, just more pages, better paper, and\nstories, which will come in time.\"--Philip Bridges\n\nMr. Bridges' wishes have also come true.\n\n\"Just what I think of TFF:--every single word in it is GOOD--I can't\nfind a solitary thing to kick about. Its perfect. Superb. I'm sure\nglad I'm a subscriber.\"--Ted Lutwin\n\nNo, readers, this is not a paid testimonial. Of course, we know the\nmagazine is far from perfect or superb, but we are pleased to see that\nthe greater part of our readers were not disappointed in it.\n\n\"Congrats on the first of the 'Fan,' it's darn good. The stf alphabet\nis swell. Tucker's article and 'Club News' are good as are the\ncolumns. Am eagerly awaiting No. 2 issue. 'The Fantasy Fan' is filling\na long-felt need and I expect it to grow and prosper. Bon\nvoyage.\"--Daniel McPhail\n\n\"Got my first issue of TFF other day. Best articles were 'Science\nFiction Alphabet,' 'About Authors,' and 'Conglamitorial.' I thought\nthe whole magazine was excellent.\"--J. Sam Smart\n\n\"'Earthling Spurns Martian' almost sent me into a fit. 'Tis a good\nlittle mag. I hope you enlarge the size later.\"--David Stolaroff\n\n\"Received my copy of your magazine and liked it swell. Just what I've\nbeen looking for! Your promise of some more new Clark Ashton Smith\nstories make it even more enticing. Good luck to you!\"--Duane W. Rimel\n\nWell, fans, just to show you that the above has not gone to our head,\nread what someone else says:\n\n\"At present, 'The Fantasy Fan' isn't worth the time it takes, to read\nit or the ink to print it. And same can be said about all the Science\nFiction 'fan' magazines.\"--B. K. Goree, Jr.\n\nMr. Goree forgot to mention that \"The Fantasy Fan\" isn't worth the\npaper it's printed on. Ink is very cheap.\n\n\"The first issue is really good, but I think a great many improvements\ncan be made. I would suggest that you use a stiff cover of some heavy\npaper, with a table of contents either on the front cover, as in the\n'Science Fiction Digest,' or on the inside of the front cover. A\nbetter grade of paper should prove of advantage. Leave the size the\nway it is.\n\n\"Now for the articles themselves. These were all good, especially\nJulius Schwartz's on the collection of science fiction, Science\nFiction in English Magazines and Sequels by Popular Demand. I do not\ncare an awful lot for Mr. Smith's stories, but have read some dandies\nby him. Some of his stories are a good cure for sleeping sickness, I\nagree with Mr. Ackerman on some points in The Boiling Point, but on\nothers--aw, phooie, Mr. Ackerman! Because I just half agree with him,\nI think I will stay neutral in the controversy. Best wishes to you in\nyour new venture. I hope you double your circulation in a few\nmonths.\"--Oswald Train\n\nWe have made several of the improvements you mention, and will make\nothers in good time. Do you want a contents page, fans, or would you\nrather have the space used for some interesting article? Give us your\nopinions on the current issue, and tell us your likes and dislikes. We\nwant to hear from you.\n\nThe Editor\n\n\n\n\nARGOSY FANTASTICS\n\n(Courtesy Don Moore, Managing Editor, Argosy)\n\n\nFantasy Fans may be interested to know some of the forthcoming\nfantastic and weird stories scheduled for publication in Argosy, which\nhas always featured this type of fiction. In the November 4th issue,\nRay Cummings has a novelette, \"Terror of the Unseen,\" in which a\ncriminal scientist masters the secret of electrical invisibility and\nthrows a great city into chaos. It is an exciting piece of science\nfiction complete in this issue.\n\nThe following week, November 11th, Erle Stanley Gardner presents the\nsecond of his series of stories about the Roadrunner, a lone wolf of\nthe Mexican border who has a strange faculty of seeing in the dark--a\nscientifically possible but rare phenomenon which leads him into\nunusual adventures. This novelette is entitled \"Border Justice.\"\n\nOtis Adelbert Kline starts his second novel of the red planet in the\nNovember 25th issue. \"The Outlaw of Mars\" is a full length novel of\nadventure in the weird world of canals, filled with amazing warfare\nand fantastic animals.\n\n\n\n\nThe Kingdom Of The Worm\n\nby Clark Ashton Smith\n\n\n[Every fantasy reader knows Clark Ashton Smith, and he needs no\nintroduction. Not only is he the favorite of thousands, but his work\nhas been said to rival and even surpass Poe. Although, as a general\nrule, we do not take sides, we admit without the slightest hesitation\nthat we enjoy Clark Ashton Smith's tales a great deal more than we do\nPoe's. Even those that find Smith's work altogether too fantastic must\nadmit that no other author has nearly as beautiful a vocabulary, and\nfew have as great an ability to produce the utterly weird effect as\nour present author. He claims that \"The Kingdom of the Worm\" is one of\nhis weirdest and most original of his tales, and we are inclined to\nagree with him. Let the story speak for itself.]\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nFOREWORD\n\nThis tale was suggested by the reading of \"The Voyages and Travels of\nSir John Maundeville,\" in which the fantastic realm of Abchaz and the\ndarkness covered province of Hanyson are actually described! I\nrecommend this colourful fourteenth-century book to lovers of fantasy.\nSir John even tells, in one chapter, how diamonds propagate\nthemselves! Truly, the world was a wonderful place in those times,\nwhen almost everyone believed in the verity of such marvels.\n\nNow in his journeying Sir John Maundeville had passed well to one side\nof that remarkable province in the kingdom of Abchaz which was called\nHanyson; and, unless he was greatly deceived by those of whom he had\ninquired the way, could deem himself within two days' travel of the\nneighboring realm of Georgia.\n\nHe had seen the river that flowed out from Hanyson, a land of hostile\nidolators on which there lay the curse of perpetual darkness; and\nwherein, it was told, the voices of people, the crowing of cocks and\nthe neighing of horses had sometimes been heard by those who\napproached its confines. But he had not paused to investigate the\nverity of these marvels; since the direct route of his journey was\nthrough another region; and also Hanyson was a place into which no\nman, not even the most hardy, would care to enter without need.\n\nHowever, as he pursued his wayfaring with the two Armenian Christians\nwho formed his retinue, he began to hear from the inhabitants of that\nportion of Abchaz the rumor of an equally dread demesne, named\nAntchar, lying before him on the road to Georgia. The tales they told\nwere both vague and frightful, and were of varying import: some said\nthat this country was a desolation peopled only by the liches of the\ndead and by loathly phantoms; others, that it was subject to the\nghouls and afrits, who devoured the dead and would suffer no living\nmortal to trespass upon their dominions; and still others spoke of\nthings all too hideous to be described, and of dire necromancies that\nprevailed in Antchar even as the might of emperors doth prevail in\nmore usually ordered lands. And the tales agreed only in this, that\nAntchar had been within mortal memory one of the fairest domains of\nAbchaz, but had been utterly laid waste by an unknown pestilence, so\nthat its high cities and broad fields were long since abandoned to the\ndesert and to such devils and other creatures as inhabit waste places.\nAnd the tellers of the tales agreed in warning Sir John to avoid this\nregion and to take the road which ran deviously to the north of\nAntchar; for Antchar was a place into which no man had gone in latter\ntimes.\n\nThe good knight listened gravely to all these, as was his wont; but\nbeing a stout Christian, and valorous withal, he would not suffer them\nto deter him from his purpose. Even when the last inhabited village\nhad been left behind, and he came to the division of the ways, and saw\nverily that the highway into Antchar had not been trodden by man or\nbeast for generations, he refused to change his intention but rode\nforward stoutly while the Armenians followed with much protest and\nsome trepidation.\n\nHowbeit, he was not blind to the sundry disagreeable tokens that began\nto declare themselves along the way. There were neither trees, herbs\nnor lichens anywhere, such as would grow in any wholesome land; but\nlow hills mottled with a leprosy of salt, and ridges bare as the bones\nof the dead.\n\nAnon he came to a pass where the hills were strait and steep on each\nhand, with pinnacled cliffs of a dark stone crumbling slowly into dust\nand taking shapes of wild horror and strangeness, of demonry and\nSatanry as they crumbled. There were faces in the stone, having the\nsemblance of ghouls or goblins, that appeared to move and twist as the\ntravellers went by; and Sir John and his companions were troubled by\nthe aspect of these faces and by the similitudes which they bore to\none another. So much alike, indeed, were many of them, that it seemed\nas if their first exemplars were preceding the wayfarers, to mock them\nanew at each turn. And aside from those which were like ghouls or\ngoblins, there were others having the features of heathen idols,\nuncouth and hideous to behold; and others still that were like the\nworm-gnawed visages of the dead; and these also appeared to repeat\nthemselves on every hand in a doubtful and wildering fashion.\n\nThe Armenians would have turned back, for they swore that the rocks\nwere alive and endowed with motion, in a land where naught else was\nliving; and they sought to dissuade Sir John from his project. But he\nsaid merely, \"Follow me, an ye will,\" and rode onward among the rocks\nand pinnacles.\n\nNow, in the ancient dust of the unused road, they saw the tracks of a\ncreature that was neither man nor any terrestrial beast; and the\ntracks were of such unwonted shape and number, and were so monstrous\nwithal, that even Sir John was disquieted thereby; and perceiving\nthem, the Armenians murmured more openly than before.\n\nAnd now, as they still pursued their way, the pinnacles of the pass\ngrew tall as giants, and were riven into the likeness of mighty limbs\nand bodies, some of which were headless and others with heads of\nTyphoean enormity. And their shadows deepened between the travellers\nand the sun, to more than the umbrage of shadows cast by rocks. And in\nthe darkest depth of the ravine, Sir John and his followers met a\nsolitary jackal, which fled them not in the manner of its kind but\npassed them with leisurely pace and bespoke them with articulate\nwords, in a voice hollow and sepulchral as that of a demon, bidding\nthem to turn back, since the land before them was an interdicted\nrealm. All were much startled thereat, considering that this was\nindeed a thing of enchantment, for a jackal to speak thus, and being\nagainst nature, was fore-ominous of ill and peril. And the Armenians\ncried out, saying they would go no further; and when the jackal had\npassed from sight, they fled after it, spurring their horses like men\nwho were themselves ridden by devils.\n\nSeeing them thus abandon him, Sir John was somewhat wroth; and also he\nwas perturbed by the warning of the jackal; and he liked not the\nthought of faring alone into Antchar. But, trusting in our Savior to\nforfend him against all harmful enchantments and the necromancies of\nSatan, he rode on among the rocks till he came forth at length from\ntheir misshapen shadows; and emerging thus, he saw before him a grey\nplain that was like the ashes of some dead land under extinguished\nheavens.\n\nAt sight of this region, his heart misgave him sorely, and he misliked\nit even more than the twisted faces of the rocks and the riven forms\nof the pinnacles. For here the bones of men, of horses and camels, had\nmarked the way with their pitiable whiteness; and the topmost branches\nof long dead trees arose like supplicative arms from the sand that had\nsifted upon the older gardens. And here there were ruinous houses,\nwith doors open to the high-drifting desert, and mausoleums sinking\nslowly in the dunes. And here, as Sir John rode forward, the sky\ndarkened above him, though not with the passage of clouds or the\ncoming of the simoon, but rather with the strange dusk of midmost\neclipse, wherein the shadows of himself and his horse were blotted\nout, and the tombs and houses were wan as phantoms.\n\nSir John had not ridden much further, when he met a horned viper, or\ncerastes, crawling toilsomely away from Antchar in the deep dust of\nthe road. And the viper spoke at it passed him, saying with a human\nvoice, \"Be warned, and go not onward into Antchar, for this is a realm\nforbidden to all mortal beings except the dead.\"\n\nNow did Sir John address himself in prayer to God the Highest, and to\nJesus Christ our Savior and all the blessed Saints, knowing surely\nthat he had arrived in a place that was subject to Satanical dominion.\nAnd while he prayed the gloom continued to thicken, till the road\nbefore him was half nighted and was no longer easy to discern. And\nthough he would have still ridden on, his charger halted in the gloom\nand would not respond to the spur, but stood and trembled like one who\nis smitten with palsy.\n\nThen, from the twilight that was nigh to darkness, there came gigantic\nfigures, muffled and silent and having, as he thought, neither mouths\nnor eyes beneath the brow-folds of their sable cerements. They uttered\nno word, nor could Sir John bespeak them in the fear that came upon\nhim; and likewise he was powerless to draw his sword. And they plucked\nhim from his saddle with fleshless hands, and led him away, half\nswooning at the horror of their touch, on paths that he perceived only\nwith the dim senses of one who goes down into the shadow of death. And\nhe knew not how far they led him nor in what direction; and he heard\nno sound as he went other than the screaming of his horse far off,\nlike a soul in mortal dread and agony: for the footfalls of those who\nhad taken him were soundless and he could not tell if they were\nphantoms or haply were veritable demons. A coldness blew upon him, but\nwithout the whisper or soughing of wind; and the air he breathed was\ndense with corruption and such odors as may emanate from a broken\ncharnel.\n\nFor a time, in the faintness that had come upon him, he saw not the\nthings that were standing beside the way, nor the shrouded shapes that\nwent by in funereal secrecy. Then, recovering his senses a little, he\nperceived that there were houses about him and the streets of a town,\nthough these were but scantly to be discerned in the night that had\nfallen without bringing the stars. Howbeit, he saw, or deemed, that\nthere were high mansions and broad thoroughfares and markets; and\namong them, as he went on, a building that bore the appearance of a\ngreat palace, with a facade that glimmered vaguely, and domes and\nturrets half swallowed up by the lowering darkness.\n\nAs he neared the facade, Sir John saw that the glimmering came from\nwithin and was cast obscurely through open doors and between\nbroad-spaced pillars. Too feeble was the light for torch or cresset,\ntoo dim for any lamp; and Sir John marvelled amid his faintness and\nterror. But when he had drawn closer still, he saw that the strange\ngleaming was like the phosphor bred by the putrefaction of a charnel.\n\nBeneath the guidance of those who held him helpless, he entered the\nbuilding. They led him through a stately hall, in whose carven columns\nand ornate furniture the opulence of kings was manifest; and thence he\ncame into a great audience-room, with a throne of gold and ebony set\non a high dais, all of which was illumed by no other light than the\nglimmering of decay. And the throne was tenanted, not by any human\nlord or sultan, but a grey, prodigious creature, of height and bulk\nexceeding those of man, and having in all its over-swollen form the\nexact similitude of a charnel-worm. And the worm was alone, and except\nfor the worm and Sir John and those beings who had brought him\nthither, the great chamber was empty as a mausoleum of old days, whose\noccupants were long since consumed by corruption.\n\nThen, standing there with a horror upon him such as no man had ever\nenvisaged, Sir John became aware that the worm was scrutinizing him\nseverely, with little eyes deep-folded in the obscene bloating of its\nface, and then, with a dreadful and solemn voice, it addressed him,\nsaying:\n\n\"I am king of Antchar, by virtue of having conquered and devoured the\nmortal ruler thereof, as well as all those who were his subjects. Know\nthen that this land is mine and that the intrusion of the living is\nunlawful and not readily to be condoned. The rashness and folly thou\nhast shown in thus coming here is verily most egregious; since thou\nwert warned by the peoples of Abchaz, and warned anew by the jackal\nand the viper which thou didst meet on the road into Antchar. Thy\ntemerity hath earned a condign punishment. And before I suffer thee to\ngo hence, I decree that thou shalt lie for a term among the dead, and\ndwell as they dwell, in a dark sepulcher, and learn the manner of\ntheir abiding and the things which none should behold with living\neyes. Yea, still alive, it shall be thine to descend and remain in the\nvery midst of death and putrefaction, for such length of time as\nseemeth meet to correct thy folly and punish thy presumption.\"\n\nSir John was one of the worthiest knights in Christendom, and his\nvalor was beyond controversy. But when he heard the speech of the\nthroned worm, and the judgement that it passed upon him, his fear\nbecame so excessive that once again he was nigh to swooning. And,\nstill in this state, he was taken hence by those who had brought him\nto the audience-room. And somewhere in the outer darkness, in a place\nof tombs and graves and cenotaphs beyond the dim town, he was flung\ninto a deep sepulcher of stone, and the brazen door of the sepulcher\nwas closed upon him.\n\nLying there through the seasonless midnight, Sir John was companioned\nonly by an unseen cadaver and by those ministrants of decay who were\nnot yet wholly done with their appointed task. Himself as one half\ndead, in the sore extremity of his horror and loathing, he could not\ntell if it were day or night in Antchar; and in all the term of\nendless hours that he lay there, he heard no sound, other than the\nbeating of his own heart, which soon became insufferably loud, and\noppressed him like the noise and tumult of a great throng.\n\nAppalled by the clamor of his heart, and affrighted by the thing which\nlay in perpetual silence beside him, and whelmed by the awesomeness\nand dire necromancy of all that had befallen him, Sir John was prone\nto despair, and scant was his hope of returning from that imprisonment\namid the dead, or of standing once more under the sun as a living man.\nIt was his to learn the voidness of death, to share the abomination of\ndesolation, and to comprehend the unutterable mysteries of corruption;\nand to do all this not as one who is a mere insensible cadaver, but\nwith soul and body still inseparate. His flesh crept, and his spirit\ncringed within him, as he felt the crawling of worms that went avidly\nto the dwindling corpse or came away in glutted slowness. And it\nseemed to Sir John at that time (and at all times thereafter) that the\ncondition of his sojourn in the tomb was verily to be accounted a\nworse thing than death.\n\nAt last, when many hours or days had gone over him, leaving the tomb's\ndarkness unchanged by the entrance of any beam or the departure of any\nshadow, Sir John was aware of a sullen clangor, and knew that the\nbrazen door had been opened. And now, for the first time, by the\ndimness of twilight that had entered the tomb, he saw in all its\npiteousness and repulsion the thing with which he had abode so long.\nIn the sickness that fell upon him at this sight, he was haled forth\nfrom the sepulcher by those who had thrust him therein: and, fainting\nonce more with the terror of their touch, and shrinking from their\ngigantic shadowy stature and cerements whose black folds revealed no\nhuman visage or form, he was led through Antchar along the road\nwhereby he had come into that dolorous realm.\n\nHis guides were silent as before; and the gloom which lay upon the\nland was even as when he had entered it, and was like the umbrage of\nsome eternal occultation. But at length, in the very place where he\nhad been taken captive, he was left to retrace his own way and to fare\nalone through the land of ruinous gardens toward the defile of the\ncrumbling rocks.\n\nWeak though he was from his confinement, and all bemazed with the\nthings which had befallen him, he followed the road till the darkness\nlightened once more and he came forth from its penumbral shadow\nbeneath a pale sun. And somewhere in the waste he met his charger,\nwandering through the sunken fields that were covered up by the sand;\nand he mounted the charger and rode hastily away from Antchar through\nthe pass of the strange boulders with mocking forms and faces. And\nafter a time he came once more to the northern road by which\ntravellers commonly went to Georgia; and here he was rejoined by the\ntwo Armenians, who had waited on the confines of Antchar, praying for\nhis secure deliverance.\n\nLong afterwards, when he had returned from his wayfaring in the East\nand among the peoples of remote isles, he told of the kingdom of\nAbchaz in the book that related his travels; and also he wrote therein\nconcerning the province of Hanyson. But he made no mention of Antchar,\nthat kingdom of darkness and decay ruled by the throned worm.\n\n\n\n\nHOW TO COLLECT FANTASY FICTION\n\nby Julius Schwartz\n\nPart Two\n\n\nThe next task is more difficult: the question of back numbers of the\ncurrent magazines. Some back issues are almost impossible to secure.\nHowever, be sure to try the magazine publishers. If this fails, scour\nthe second-hand book and magazine stores. If they haven't the issues,\nleave a standing order with them. (They're eager for business and\nthey'll make an honest attempt to secure the desired issues for you.)\nScan the discussions columns. Readers often offer to sell or trade\nback numbers. Then try the large second-hand magazine dealers, such as\nCarl Swanson, Washburn, North Dakota and the Smith Book Co., Box 661,\nLawrence, Massachusetts.\n\nAs a last resort advertise.\n\nThat takes care of all magazines that are now being published. Now we\nhave to contend with real difficulties. We're going to trail down\nfantasy stories that were published in magazines no longer sold at\nnewsstands! Chief among these defunct magazines is Astounding Stories,\nStrange Tales, and Wonder Stories Quarterly. (More details are needed\nwith these out-of-print magazines, so it'll be given whenever definite\ninformation is known concerning them.) This periodical (Astounding\nStories), a science fiction magazine, first appeared on the newsstands\nwith its January, 1930 issue and was discontinued but a short time\nago, in March 1933. Its companion magazine, Strange Tales, published\nweird, fantastic fiction. Dates: September, 1931 to January, 1933.\nWonder Stories Quarterly, science fiction, ran from Fall, 1929 to\nWinter, 1933, publishing only inter-planetary tales in the last two\nyears.\n\n(Next month Mr. Schwartz describes the less known fantasy magazines.)\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nSubscribe now and insure yourself of a monthly copy.

What happened to the sequel to \"Thru the Dragon Glass,\" by A.\nMerritt?--David Stolaroff\n\nFor some unknown reason, Mr. Merritt never wrote a sequel to this\nstory, although it could stand one very well.

Charles Willard\nDiffin and C. D. Willard is the same author.... The fastest writer:\nArthur J. Burks. The slowest: Edward Elme Smith.... P. Schuyler Miller\nbecame a science fiction author as the result of a cover contest....\nYou can't call Raymond Gallun a half-pint, anyway. (How did that pun\nget into this column?)... The question is still unsatisfactorily: WHO\nis Anthony Gilmore???... Allen Glasser's \"Captives in Space\" in the\nJuly, 1932 \"The Time Traveller\" is a rejected entry of the November,\n1929 Science Wonder Stories cover contest.... Two of the titles of H.\nG. Winter's stories contain the word \"ice,\" which seems quite\nappropriate.... Sewell Peaslee Wright had a story in Weird years\nbefore Astounding.\n\n\n\n\nCONTEST RESULTS\n\n\nThe winner of last month's cash prize contest is William Sykora, 35-51\n41st St., Long Island City, New York. Here is his answer to \"Why do\nyou read fantasy fiction?\"\n\n\"Why do I read fantasy fiction? I often wonder. The occult, the\nfantastic, have always held me with supreme, almost unholy,\nfascination. I have found that by constant practice, an all-excluding,\nall-consuming concentration bonds stronger than the strongest steel to\nall dismally horrible tales of the supernatural. The earthly ties that\nhold me mentally and morally to a workaday existence, are hypnotically\nrent asunder by a mesmerism born of steely sharp concentration. Thus\ndo I thrill--quake--and shudder with the delightful ecstasy of bizarre\nadventure through the awful expanse of the inconceivably terrible\nunknown universe, and I love it.\"\n\nBecause of lack of support, we will not present another cash prize\ncontest, until enough readers ask for one. If we receive enough\npetitions, we will take great pleasure in featuring another in the\nnear future.\n\n\n\n\nSUPERNATURAL HORROR IN LITERATURE\n\nby H. P. Lovecraft\n\n(Copyright, 1927 by W. Paul Cook)\n\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThe oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest\nand strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown. These facts few\npsychologists will dispute, and their admitted truth must establish\nfor all time the genuineness and dignity of the weirdly horrible tale\nas a literary form. Against it are discharged all the shafts of a\nmaterialistic sophistication which clings to frequently felt emotions\nand external events, and a naively insipid idealism which deprecates\nthe aesthetic motive and calls for a didactic literature to \"uplift\"\nthe reader toward a suitable degree of smirking optimism. But in spite\nof all this opposition, the weird tale has survived, developed, and\nattained remarkable heights of perfection; founded as it is on a\nprofound and elementary principle whose appeal, if not always\nuniversal, must necessarily be poignant and permanent to minds of the\nrequisite sensitiveness.\n\nThe appeal of the spectrally macabre is generally narrow because it\ndemands from the reader a certain degree of imagination and a capacity\nfor detachment from everyday life. Relatively few are free enough from\nthe spell of daily routine to respond to rappings from outside, and\ntales of ordinary feelings and events, or of common sentimental\ndistortions of such feelings and events, will always take first place\nin the taste of the majority; rightly, perhaps, since, of course,\nthese ordinary matters make up the greater part of human experience.\nBut the sensitive are always with us, and sometimes a curious streak\nof fancy invades an obscure corner of the very hardest head; so that\nno amount of rationalism, reform, or Freudian analysis can quite annul\nthe thrill of the chimney-corner whisper of the lonely wood. There is\nhere involved a psychological pattern or tradition as real and as\ndeeply grounded in mental experience as any other pattern or tradition\nof mankind; coeval with the religious feeling and closely related to\nmany aspects of it, and too much a part of our inmost biological\nheritage to lose keen potency over a very important, though not\nnumerically great, minority of our species.\n\nMan's first instincts and emotions form his response to the\nenvironment in which he found himself. Definite feelings based on\npleasure and pain grew up around the phenomena whose causes and\neffects he understood, whilst around those which he did not\nunderstand--and the universe teemed with them in the early days--were\nnaturally woven such personifications, marvelous interpretations, and\nsensations of awe and fear as would be hit upon by a race having few\nand simple ideas and limited experience. The unknown, being likewise\nthe unpredictable, became for our primitive forefathers a terrible and\nomnipotent source of boons and calamities visited upon mankind for\ncryptic and wholly extra-terrestrial reasons, and thus clearly\nbelonged to a sphere of existence whereof we know nothing and wherein\nwe have no part. The phenomenon of dreaming likewise helped to build\nup the notion of an unreal or spiritual world; and in general, all the\nconditions of savage dawn-life so strongly conduced to a feeling of\nthe supernatural, that we need not wonder at the thoroughness with\nwhich man's very hereditary essence has become saturated with religion\nand superstition. That saturation must, as a matter of plain\nscientific fact, be regarded as virtually permanent so far as the\nsubconscious mind and inner instincts are concerned; for though the\narea of the unknown has been steadily contracting for thousands of\nyears, an infinite reservoir of mystery still engulfs most of the\nouter cosmos, whilst a vast residuum of powerful inherited\nassociations clings around all the objects and processes that were\nonce mysterious, however well they may now be explained. And more than\nthis, there is an actual physiological fixation of the old instincts\nin our nervous tissue, which would make them obscurely operative even\nwere the conscious mind to be purged of all sources of wonder.\n\n(continued next month)\n\n\n\n\nTRUE GHOST STORIES\n\n\nEdwin C. Hill talks on various subjects every night on the Columbia\nBroadcasting System. One evening he devoted his program to ghost\nstories about London that are supposed to be true. They sound very\nconvincing and have many witnesses. We leave it to the reader whether\nto accept them as truth, or discard them as merely hallucinations.\nHowever, they are extremely interesting, nevertheless.\n\nOnce, two sailors were roaming around London and came upon an old, but\nhandsome, mansion.\n\n\"Funny no one lives here,\" said one, \"This shack seems too good to be\nleft vacant.\"\n\nBut the two sailors didn't intend to leave it vacant that night. They\nhad no money, and thus could not pay for lodging, so they entered the\nold house, intending to spend the night there.\n\nAfter climbing to the second floor and finding a fireplace, they built\na blazing fire with some wood they had secured. Curling up in some old\nclothes, they went to sleep beside the roaring fire.\n\nSuddenly, after many hours, one of the sailors awoke, half-conscious\nof some noise. There it was again! It sounded like a door being\nclosed. Yes--that's what it must have been. A few pieces of wood to\nbring the dying fire to renewed activity gave him some courage, but he\nwoke the other sailor anyway.\n\nHe had hardly time to explain to his friend the reason for his\ndisturbance, when the noise was repeated.\n\n\"It's the wind,\" said one, and they accepted that explanation,\npreparing to go to sleep again, but instantly their returned with\ngreater confirmation. Another sound.\n\nAny thoughts but of the supernatural were out of the question. This\ntime it was footsteps--but what footsteps! Not human--not animal! They\nwere padded sounds--something like bare feet. Nearer and nearer.\n\nSuddenly they stopped, and the door opened. Slowly--and there was\nrevealed to their terrified senses the most horrible monstrosity\nimaginable. It could not be of this earth!\n\nOne crazed sailor jumped past it and flew down the stairs, out of the\nhouse, and screamed in mortal terror into the streets.\n\nHe told his story--and the next day the body of his companion was\nfound mangled on the ground. He had leaped out of a second story\nwindow.\n\nAnother story tells the tale of a man walking through a London park at\nday-break on the bank of the Thames. While passing a bridge, he spies\na woman jumping into the river, and he takes off his coat preparing to\nsave her, but a hand touches his shoulder. An officer.\n\n\"It's no use,\" he said, \"You could not save her. She is not a living\nwoman. Return tomorrow at this time and you will see her repeat her\nghastly act.\"\n\nThe bewildered man did so, and the next morning was but a repetition\nof the one before.\n\n\"You see?\" said the officer, \"She does that for seven consecutive\nmornings each year. Today is the last one this year. She died here a\nlong time ago.\"\n\n(This article will be concluded next month.)\n\n\n\n\nTHE BOILING POINT\n\n\nYou will remember the terrific outburst Forrest J. Ackerman made upon\nClark Ashton Smith's stories and weird tales in general in last\nmonth's column. Shortly after the issue went to press, we received the\nfollowing postscript to his article which he requested to have printed\nat the beginning of this month's column.\n\n\"I could as well pick on John Taine--a favorite author, mind you--for\n'The Time Stream' in Wonder Stories, another story considered doubtful\nscience fiction. My only interest is to keep stf. in the stf.\npublications, and let fantasies and weird tales appear in the\nmagazines featuring that type.\n\n\"It is to be hoped that Mr. Smith will discover many of his admirers\nthru the writings of readers caring to present arguments....\"\n\nIt is only fair that Mr. Smith himself should have the first blow\nagainst Mr. Ackerman's argument, in defense of his own stories. He\ncalls his defense \"Horror, Fantasy and Science.\"\n\n\"Mr. Ackerman's fervent and ebullient denunciation of my stories,\nfollowed by Editor Hornig's invitation to join the melee, is not to be\nresisted.\n\n\"I infer that Forrest J. Ackerman considers horror, weirdness and\nunearthliness beyond the bounds of science or science or science\nfiction. Since horror and weirdness are integral elements of life (as\nis well known to those who have delved beneath the surface) and since,\nin all likelihood, the major portion of the universe is quite\nunearthly, I fail to understand the process of logic or syllogism by\nwhich he has arrived at this truly amazing proscription.\n\n\"Let me recommend to Mr. Ackerman, and to others like him, a more\nscientifically open and receptive attitude of imagination. If Mr.\nAckerman were transported to some alien world, I fear that he would\nfind the reality far more incredible, bizarre, grotesque, fantastic,\nhorrific, and impossible than any of my stories.\n\n\"In regard to 'The Light From Beyond,' I cannot see that this tale is\nany more fantastic and unreal than others dealing with unknown\ndimensions or planes of hyper-space. Physical entry into such planes\nis improbable, but form an alluring theme for fictional speculation.\n\n\"It is curious that Mr. Ackerman should profess to like 'Flight Into\nSuper-Time', a story which is wilder, if anything, than the ones he\nhas denounced. I might also add that it was written as a satire on\ntime-travelling, and should not have been read too seriously.\n\n\"Of course, it is Forrest Ackerman's privilege to dislike my stories,\nand to express his dislike whenever he chooses. I have merely tried to\npoint out that he is in error when he condemns them as being\ninherently unsuitable for a scientifiction magazine.\"\n\nH. P. Lovecraft also defends the weird tale:\n\n\"As for Ackerman's ebullition, I fear he can hardly be taken seriously\nin matters involving the criticism of imaginative fiction. Smith's\nstory was really splendid, except for the cheap ending on which the\nEditor Wonder Stories insisted. Ackerman once wrote me a letter with a\nvery childish attack on my work--he evidently enjoys verbal\npyrotechnics for their own sake and seems so callous to imaginative\nimpressions.\"\n\nAugust W. Derleth liked everything in \"The Fantasy Fan\" except the\nletter in this department from Forrest J. Ackerman \"Who,\" he says,\n\"while usually quite interesting, nevertheless has the unpleasant\nhabit of trying to make everything over into his own imagine.\"\n\nR. H. Barlow gives an open reply to Mr. Ackerman in defense of Clark\nAshton Smith.\n\n\"To my mind you are deplorably lacking in imagination to so condemn\nsome of the finest work of the greatest living fantasy writer. Must\nyou be so literal, physical, in your interpretation of imaginative\nliterature? Clark Ashton Smith, whom I have the honor of knowing, is\nprimarily and foremost a poet, his work having received the highest\ncommendation of such persons as Edwin Markham, George Sterling, etc.\nTruly, his colourfully nightmarish visions are far superior to the\nconventional type of--forgive me--trash--printed in the average\nmercenary scientifiction magazine. The mere fact that a few helpless\nray-projectors, heroine consisting mainly of lipstick and legs, and a\ndastardly villain, are not dragged in by the nape of their respective\nnecks certainly does nothing to impair the excellence of his dulcet\nprose, but rather it an agreeable relief.\"\n\nCome on, now, everybody join in the battle!\n\n\n\n\nANNALS OF THE JINNS\n\nby R. H. Barlow\n\n\"...Thither Ganigul often retired in the daytime to read in quiet the\nmarvelous annals of the Jinns, the chronicles of ancient worlds, and\nthe prophecies relating to the worlds that are yet to be born....\"\n\n    Wm. Beckford\n    --\"Story of Prince Barkiarokh\"\n\n\n1--The Black Tower\n\nAt the head of the winding river Olaee, nearby the fragrant forest,\nstands the Black Tower of the Southlands. High into the air rise its\nbleak stone walls, piercing the sunset with slender spire. For\neternity it has been there; by the sluggish waters on which float\ngreat bloated crimson lilies and for eternity will it be there. The\npeasants of the nearby village know not whence it came nor why 'tis\nthere, and wisely avoid it when the moon is on the wane. Few dare\nvisit the colourful forest of evil or the treacherous river, for\nstrange and unholy things dwell therein.\n\nSome tell of how on the dark of the moon there comes from the great\nstar Sirius a growing speck of flame ultimately losing itself in the\neternal midnight of outer space. However this may be, it is certain\nstrange and alien beings built this ebon tower in the dawn of the\nworld, for purposes not understood by mortals; sealing the door long\nages since.\n\nThere is a tale the old wives spin, saying: One of the adventurous\nvillagers, Castor by name, took undue interest in the tower and was\nfrequently seen slipping furtively to and from it in the dusk. Of all\nthe people of the town he had the least savoury ancestry, his father\nbeing a satyr, his mother a witch-woman. True, others mated with the\npeople of the glen, yet it is not considered a thing to be proud of.\nThe very Burgomaster had a gnome none too far back in his lineage,\nwhich was expressed in the coarse features of his evil countenance.\nBut a satyr! The righteous citizens avoided Castor scrupulously, and\nthe dislike was mutual. So it was he continued on his silent trips\nunheeded.\n\nWhat he did there so often not known but the seasons came and went and\nthe winter merged into spring and in time it was Walburgas Eve. That\nnight the town gates were tightly closed and bolted and all cowered\nbehind locked doors. Strange shapes flew screeching through the air\nand sniffed most horribly at the doorsteps.\n\nThat night Castor went to the tower as had become his habit, though\nhis better sense warned him to stay home abed. His satyr ancestry\nopenly rebelled, but the witch proved stronger. As he stole timorously\nthrough the wood he heard sounds of high revelry from within the\ncastle. Therefore, he was quiet as he hesitated before the foot of the\nlong unopened door. Queer things were abroad though he dared not\nreturn home alone through the forest, still more did he fear to remain\nwithin reach of the Things of the tower. As he deliberated on the\ncourse to take the great door swung silently open and a crab like claw\nlovingly encircled his waist and drew him in.\n\nAnd he was seen no more by the villagers.\n\n\n\n\nSCIENCE FICTION IN ENGLISH MAGAZINES\n\n(Series 2)\n\nby Bob Tucker\n\n\nWhat England needs is a good science fiction mag.

Ackerman\n\nPart Two\n\n\nThe foregoing covers approximately half of my set. The remaining\nportions of my stf collection are more to be looked at than read. My\nstf books and magazines lie behind sliding panels. These panels are\ndecorated with various original stf illustrations. Two are by an\nartist friend showing the rocketship STF-I over a foreign world, and\nthe other a city of the future. One is by Morey. There is a Tarzan\njig-saw puzzle, and one of the mighty 56 foot prehistoric ape, King\nKong, engaging in a battle with a flesh-eating allosaur. From \"The\nSwordsman of Mars\" comes another drawing. Two striking Paul\nillustrations are prominent, one being what I consider one of his very\nbest: the inside drawing for \"The City of Singing Flame,\" picturing\nthe towering black and ivory edifices of that weird world. Buck Rogers\nin his interesting costume with rocket pistol smiles down. And Elliott\nDold, Jr. has autographed his original frontispiece for Miracle\nStories' first issue, \"The Midnite Mail takes off for Mars.\" Paul's\noriginal Wonder Stories' cover for \"The Dust of Destruction\" hangs on\na side wall.\n\n(Next month Mr. Ackerman describes his science fiction autographs.)\n\n\n\n\nTHE SCIENCE FICTION ALPHABET\n\nby Allen Glasser\n\nPart Two--Conclusion\n\n\n    N is for Newton, the Gravity King,\n    Whose laws, in our mags, just don't mean a thing.\n\n    O's for Ourselves, who read science-fiction\n    We know what we like, and there's no dereliction.\n\n    P's for the Princess that's always on hand\n    To wed the brave Earthman who visits her land.\n\n    Q is for Quinn, the weird-story writer;\n    If he'd do science fiction his fame might be brighter.\n\n    R is for Robot, of whom much is said;\n    For many an author his antics have fed.\n\n    S is for Starzl, Schachner, and Sloane;\n    And let's not forget Doc Smith and Miss Stone.\n\n    T is for Time, a favorite theme\n    Which never grows stale--or so it would seem.\n\n    U is the Unknown, which writers employ\n    Whenever they need some death dealing toy.\n\n    V is for Venus, which belonged to one Kline\n    Until Mr. Burroughs took over that line.\n\n    W's Wonder, a changeable book;\n    You never can tell how it's going to look.\n\n    X means \"okay\" when written \"All X\"\n    A term which has brought Doctor Smith many checks.\n\n    Y's for the Yarn which will suit everyone;\n    We hardly believe it can ever be done.\n\n    Z is for Zagat--whom else could it be?\n    It's lucky for us his name starts with Z!\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nCome over to \"Our Readers Say\" and \"The Boiling Point\" and have a\nword.\n\n\n\n\nSEQUELS--BY POPULAR DEMAND\n\nby Walt Z. Russjuchi\n\nPart Two\n\n\nRay Cummings' first story, in 1919, \"The Girl in the Golden Atom,\"\npractically shrieked to the skies for a sequel, and Cummings obliged a\nyear later with \"The People of the Golden Atom.\"\n\nThen, in 1921, Austin Hall, and Homer Eon Flint collaborated to write\nthat remarkable story, \"The Blind Spot,\" and what a fervor that\ncreated! The mystery of the \"Blind Spot\" was left unexplained,\nloopholes were hanging in the air, and it had one of the most\nunsatisfactory endings of them all. Readers entreated and implored the\neditor and the authors for a sequel. But alas! Just about this time\nHomer Eon Flint died, and it wasn't until 11 years later that the fans\nread Austin Hall's sequel, \"The Spot of Life.\"\n\nRalph Milne Farley's \"The Radio Man\" created another sensation when it\nappeared in the 1924 Argosy-All Story, and it was followed by seven\n\"radio\" novels (only three of which, however, are related to the\noriginal story.)\n\n\"The Face in the Abyss\" by A. Merritt was received mildly by the\nreaders of the same magazine in 1923. It wasn't until Amazing Stories\nAnnual reprinted this story in 1927 that a sequel was asked for.\nIronically enough, though these readers were responsible for the\nsequels, \"The Snake Mother,\" being written, it appeared in Argosy in\n1930.\n\nWith the publication of Edward Elmer Smith's \"The Skylark of Space\" in\n1928, the editorial offices of Amazing Stories were swamped with\nbeseechings for the further adventures of the Skylark.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.  Email\ncontact links and up to date contact information can be found at the\nFoundation's web site and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
