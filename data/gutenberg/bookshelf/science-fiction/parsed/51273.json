The face that looked back wasn't bad, if he had\nexpected strong cheekbones, copper skin and a high-arched nose. But Dan\nwasn't used to it yet.\n\nHe straightened and his coat drew tight across chest and shoulders. The\nsleeves pulled up above hands that felt average, but that the mirror\nshowed to be huge and broad. Dan turned to go out in the hall and had\nto duck to avoid banging his head on the door frame. On the way down\nthe hall, he wondered just what sort of job he had drawn this time.\n\nDan stopped at a door lettered:\n\n      A SECTION\n    J. KIELGAARD\n      DIRECTOR\n\nA pretty receptionist goggled at him and said to go in. Dan opened the\ninner door.\n\nKielgaard--big, stocky, expensively dressed--looked up and studied Dan\nas he came in. Apparently satisfied, he offered a chair, then took out\na small plastic cartridge and held it in one hand.\n\n\"Dan,\" he said, \"what do you know about subspace and null-points?\"\n\n\"Practically nothing,\" admitted Dan honestly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKielgaard laughed. \"Then I'll fill you in with the layman's analogy,\nwhich is all _I_ know. Suppose you have a newspaper with an ant on the\nmiddle of the front page. To get to the middle of page two, the ant\nhas to walk to the edge of the paper, then walk back on the inside.\nNow suppose the ant could go _through_ the page. The middle of page\ntwo is just a short distance away from the middle of page one. That\ngoing _through_, instead of around, is like travel in subspace. And\na null-point is a place just a short distance away, going through\nsubspace. The middle of page two, for instance, is a null-point for the\nmiddle of page one.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Dan patiently, waiting for the point of the interview.\n\nKielgaard pushed the plastic cartridge he'd been holding through a slot\nin his desk. A globe to one side lighted up a cottony white, with faint\nstreaks of blue. \"This,\" he said, \"is Porcys.\"\n\nDan studied the globe. \"Under that cloud blanket, it looks as if it\nmight be a water world.\"\n\n\"It is. Except for a small continent, the planet is covered with water.\nAnd the water is full of seafood--_edible_ seafood.\"\n\nDan frowned, still waiting.\n\n\"Galactic Enterprises,\" said Kielgaard, \"has discovered a region in\nsubspace which has Porcys for one null-point and Earth for another.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Dan, beginning to get the point. \"And Earth's hungry, of\ncourse. Galactic can ship the seafood straight through subspace at a\nbig profit.\"\n\n\"That's the idea. But there's one trouble.\" Kielgaard touched a button,\nand on the globe, the white layer vanished. The globe was a brilliant\nblue, with a small area of mingled green and grayish-brown. \"The land\narea of the planet is inhabited. Galactic must have the permission of\nthe inhabitants to fish the ocean. And Galactic needs to close the\ndeal fast, or some other outfit, like Trans-Space, may get wind of\nthings and move in.\"\n\nKielgaard looked at the globe thoughtfully. \"All we know about the\nPorcyns could be put on one side of a postage stamp. They're physically\nstrong. They have a few large cities. They have an abundant supply\nof seafood. They have spaceships and mataform transceivers. This\nmuch we know from long-distance observation or from the one Porcyn\nwe anesthetized and brain-spied. We also know from observation\nthat the Porcyns have two other habitable planets in their solar\nsystem--Fumidor, a hot inner planet, and an Earthlike outer planet\ncalled Vacation Planet.\"\n\nKielgaard drummed his fingers softly. \"Granting the usual course\nof events, Dan, what can we expect to happen? The Porcyns have an\nabundance of food, a small living area, space travel and two nearby\nhabitable planets. What will they do?\"\n\n\"Colonize the nearby planets,\" said Dan.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Right,\" said Kielgaard. \"Only they aren't doing it. We've spied both\nplanets till we can't see straight. Fumidor has a mine entrance and a\nmataform center. Vacation Planet has a mataform center and one or two\nbig buildings. And that's it. There's no emigration from Porcys to the\nother two planets. Instead, there's a sort of cycling flow from Porcys\nto Vacation Planet to Fumidor to Porcys. Why?\n\n\"The Porcyn we brain-spied,\" he went on, \"associated Vacation Planet\nwith 'rejuvenation.' What does that mean we're up against? Galactic\nwants to make a contract, but not till they know what they're\ndealing with. There are some races it's best to leave alone. This\n'rejuvenation' might be worth more than the seafood, sure, but it could\nalso be a sackful of trouble.\"\n\nDan waited, realizing that Kielgaard had come to the crux of the matter.\n\nKielgaard said, \"Galactic wants us to find the answers to three\nproblems. One, how do the Porcyns keep the size of their population\ndown? Two, what is the connection between rejuvenation and 'Vacation\nPlanet'? And three, do the Porcyns have a proper mercantile attitude?\nAre they likely to make an agreement? Will they keep one they do make?\"\n\nKielgaard looked intently at Dan. \"The only way we're likely to\nfind the answers in a reasonable time is to send someone in. You're\nelected.\"\n\n\"Just me?\" asked Dan in surprise. \"All your eggs in one basket?\"\n\n\"In a situation like this,\" said Kielgaard, \"one good man is worth\nseveral gross of dubs. We're relying on you to keep your eyes open and\nyour mind on what you're doing.\"\n\n\"And suppose I don't come back?\"\n\n\"Galactic probably loses the jump it's got on Trans-Space and you miss\nout on a big bonus.\"\n\n\"When do I leave?\"\n\n\"Tomorrow morning. But today you'd better go down and pick up a set of\nPorcyn clothes we've had made for you and some of their money. It'd\nbe a good idea to spend the evening getting used to things. We've\nimplanted in your brain the Porcyn language patterns we brain-spied\nand we've installed in your body cavity a simple organo-transmitter\nyou can use during periods of calm. Because the Porcyns are physically\nstrong and possibly worship strength, we've had your body rebuilt to\none of the most powerful human physique patterns--that of an American\nIndian--that we have on record.\"\n\nThey shook hands and Dan went to his room. He practiced the Porcyn\ntongue till he had some conscious familiarity with it. Then he tried\nhis strength to make sure he wouldn't accidentally use more force than\nhe intended. Then, while the evening was still young, he went to bed\nand fell asleep.\n\nIt was Dan's experience that everything possible went wrong the first\nfew days on a new planet and he wanted to be wide-awake enough to live\nthrough it.\n\n\nII\n\nThe next day, Dan left in a spacetug that Galactic was sending on a\npractice trip through subspace to Porcys. From the tug, he went by\nmataform to the lab ship in the Porcyn sea. Here he learned that he had\nonly twenty minutes during which conditions would be right to make the\nnext mataform jump to a trawler close to the mainland.\n\nDan had wanted to talk to the men on the lab ship and learn all they\ncould tell him about the planet. This being impossible, he determined\nto question the trawler crew to the limit of their patience.\n\nWhen Dan reached the trawler, it was dancing like a blown leaf in a\nhigh wind. He became miserably seasick. That evening, there was a\nviolent electrical storm which lasted into the early morning.\n\nDan spent the whole night nauseously gripping the edge of his bunk, his\nlegs braced against the violent heave and lurch of the trawler.\n\nBefore dawn of the next day, aching in every muscle, his insides sore\nand tender, his mind fuzzy from lack of sleep, Dan was set ashore on a\ndark, quiet and foggy strip of beach. He stood for a moment in the soft\nsand, feeling it seem to dip underfoot.\n\nThis, he thought, was undoubtedly the worst start he had ever made on\nany planet anywhere.\n\nFrom around him in the impenetrable fog came distant croakings,\nwhistlings and hisses. The sounds were an unpleasant suggestion that\nsomething else had gone wrong. Between bouts of sickness, Dan had tried\nto arrange with the crew to land him near the outskirts of a Porcyn\ncity. But the sounds were those of the open country.\n\nWhat Dan wanted was to go through the outskirts of the city before\nmany people were moving around. He could learn a great deal from their\nhomes, their means of transportation and the actions of a few early\nrisers. He could learn from the things he expected to see, or from the\nlack of them, _if_ he was there to see them.\n\nDan moved slowly inland, crossed a ditch and came to what seemed to\nbe a macadam road. He checked his directions and started to walk. He\nforced the pace so his breath came hard, and hoped it would pump some\nlife into his dulled brain and muscles.\n\nAs his senses gradually began to waken, Dan became aware of an odd\n_swish-swish, swish-swish_, like a broom dusting lightly over the\npavement behind him. The sound drew steadily closer.\n\nDan halted abruptly.\n\nThe sound stopped, too.\n\nHe walked on.\n\n_Swish-swish._\n\nHe whirled.\n\nSilence.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDan listened carefully. The sound could be that of whatever on Porcys\ncorresponded to a playful puppy--or to a rattlesnake.\n\nHe stepped sharply forward.\n\n_Swish-swish._ It was behind him.\n\nHe whirled.\n\nThere was a feeling of innumerable hairy spiders running over him from\nhead to foot. The vague shape of a net formed and vanished in the gloom\nbefore him. He lashed out and hit the dark and the fog.\n\n_Swish-swish._ It was moving away.\n\nHe stood still while the sound faded to a whisper and was gone. Then\nhe started to walk. He was sure that what had just happened meant\nsomething, but _what_ it meant was a different question. At least, he\nthought ruefully, he was wider awake now.\n\nHe walked on as the sky grew lighter. Then the fog shifted to show a\nsolid mass of low blocky buildings across the road ahead. The road\nitself disappeared into a tunnel under one of the buildings. To one\nside, a waist-high metal rail closed off the end of one of the city's\nstreets. Dan walked off the road toward the rail. His eye was caught\nby the building ahead. Each was exactly the same height, about two to\nthree Earth stories high. They were laid out along a geometrically\nstraight border with no transition between city and farmland.\n\nThere was a faint hum. Then a long, low streak, its front end rounded\nlike a horseshoe crab, shot out of the tunnel under the building beside\nhim and vanished along the road where he'd just been walking.\n\nNow Dan saw a small modest sign beside the road.\n\n        Care\n     High-Speed\n    Vehicles Only\n     --_Swept_--\n\nDan crossed the rail at the end of the street with great caution.\n\nThe Porcyn clothing he was wearing consisted of low leather boots,\nlong green hose, leather shorts, a bright purple blouse and a sky-blue\ncape. Dan bunched the cape in his hand and thrust it ahead of him as\nhe crossed the rail, for some races were finicky about their exits and\nentrances. The straight, sharp boundary between city and farmland,\nand the identical buildings, suggested to Dan that here was a race\ncontrolled by strict rules and forms, and he was making an obviously\nunauthorized entrance.\n\nIt was with relief that he stood on the opposite side, within the city.\nHe glanced back at the sign and wondered what \"Swept\" meant. Then he\ngave his attention to the buildings ahead of him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLow at first, the buildings rose regularly to a greater height, as far\nas the fog would let him see. Dan remembered the storm of the night\nbefore and wondered if the progressive heightening of the buildings was\ndesigned to break the force of the wind. The buildings themselves were\nmassive, with few and narrow windows, and wide heavy doors opening on\nthe street.\n\nDan walked farther into the city and found that the street took\nright-angle bends at regular intervals, probably also to break the\nwind. There was no one in sight, and no vehicles.\n\nDan decided he was probably in a warehouse district.\n\nHe paused to look at a partly erected new building, built on the\npattern of the rest. Then he heard from up the street a grunting,\nstraining sound interspersed with whistling puffs. There was a stamping\nnoise, a _thud_ and the clash of metal.\n\nDan ran as quietly as he could up the street, stopped, glanced around\none of the right-angle bends. He was sure the sound had come from there.\n\nThe street was empty.\n\nDan walked closer and studied a large brass plate set in the base of\na building. It looked about twenty inches high by thirty wide with a\nrough finish. In the center of the plate was a single word:\n\n    SWEEPER\n\nDan looked at this for a moment. Then, frowning, he strode on. In his\nmind's eye, he was seeing the sign by the road:\n\n        Care\n     High-Speed\n    Vehicles Only\n     --_Swept_--\n\nDan couldn't decide whether the word \"Swept\" was part of the warning or\njust an afterthought. In any case, he had plainly heard a struggle here\nand now there was nothing to be seen. Alert for more brass plates, he\nwound his way through the streets until he came out on a broad avenue.\nOn the opposite side were a number of tall, many-windowed buildings\nlike apartment houses. On the sidewalks and small lawns in front,\ncrowds of children were playing. They were wearing low boots, leather\nshorts or skirts, brightly colored blouses and hose, and yellow capes.\nWalking quietly among them was a tawny animal with the look and lordly\nmanner of a lion.\n\nIt _was_ a lion.\n\nAs far as the rapidly dispersing fog let him see, the avenue ran\nstraight in one direction. In the other, it ended a block or so away.\nApparently the crooked, wind-breaking streets were only on the edge of\nthe city.\n\nDan thought of the questions Kielgaard wanted him to answer:\n\n1, how do the Porcyns keep the size of their population down?\n\n2, what is the connection between rejuvenation and Vacation Planet?\n\n3, do the Porcyns have a proper mercantile attitude? Are they likely to\nmake an agreement? Will they keep one they do make?\n\nTo find the answers, Dan intended to work his way carefully through\nthe city. If nothing went wrong, he should be able to see enough to\neliminate most of the possibilities. Already he had seen enough to\nmake Porcyns look unpromising. The rigid city boundary, the strict\nuniformity of the buildings and the uniform pattern of the clothing\nsuggested a case-hardened, ingrown way of living.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAcross the street, a low door to one side of the apartment building's\nmain entrance came open. The lion walked out.\n\nIt was carrying a squirming little boy by his bunched-up cape. The big\ncreature flopped down, pinned the struggling boy with a huge paw and\nmethodically started to clean him. The rasp of the animal's tongue\ncould be heard clearly across the street.\n\nThe boy yelled.\n\nA healthy-looking girl of about twelve, wearing a cape diagonally\nstriped in yellow and red, ran over and rescued the boy. The lion\nrolled over on its back to have its belly scratched.\n\nDan scowled and walked toward the near end of the street. On\nless advanced planets, where the danger of detection was not so\ngreat, agents often went in with complex, surgically inserted\norgano-transmitters in their body cavities. Unlike the simple\ncommunicator Dan had, these were fitted with special taps on the optic\nand auditory nerves, and the transmitter continuously broadcast all\nthat the agent saw and heard. Experts back home went over the data and\nmade their own conclusions.\n\nThe method was useful, but it had led to some dangerous mistakes. Sight\nand sound got across, but often the atmosphere of the place didn't. Dan\nthought it might be the same here.\n\nThe feeling that the city gave him didn't match what his reasoning told\nhim.\n\nHe crossed a street, passed an inscription on a building:\n\n     Freedom\n    Devisement\n    Fraternity\n\nThen he was back in a twisting maze of streets. He walked till the wind\nfrom the sea blew in his face.\n\nThe street dipped to a massive wall and the sea, where a few brightly\ncolored, slow-moving trawlers were going out. Dan turned in another\nstreet and wound back and forth till he came out along the ocean front.\nOn one side of the street was the ocean, a broad strip of sand, and\nthe sea wall. On the other side was a row of small shops, brightly\nawninged, with displays just being set in place out in front.\n\nIn the harbor, a ship was being unloaded. Flat-bottomed boats were\nrunning back and forth from several long wharves. On the street ahead,\na number of heavy wagons, drawn by six-legged animals with heads like\neels, bumped and rattled toward the wharves. Behind them ran a crowd\nof boys in yellow capes, a big tawny lioness trotting among them. On\nthe sidewalk nearby strode a few powerfully built old men, their capes\nof various colors.\n\nDan glanced at the displays in front of the shops. Some were cases of\nfish on ice. Others were piles of odd vegetables in racks. Dan paused\nto look at a stack of things like purple carrots.\n\nA man immediately came forward from the rear of the store, wiping his\nhands on his apron. Dan moved on.\n\nThe next shop had the universal low boots, shorts, skirts, blouses and\nhose, in assorted sizes and colors, but no capes. Dan slowed to glance\nat the display and saw the proprietor coming briskly from the dark\ninterior, rubbing his hands. Dan speeded up and got away before the\nproprietor came out.\n\nThe Porcyns, he thought, seemed at least to have a proper mercantile\nattitude.\n\n\nIII\n\nDan passed another fish market, then came to a big, brightly polished\nwindow. Inside was a huge, chromium-plated bar-bell on a purple velvet\ncloth. Behind it were arranged displays of hand-grips, exercise\ncables, dumb-bells and skipping ropes. The inside of the store was\nindirectly lighted and expensively simple. The place had an air that\nwas quiet, lavish and discreet. It reminded Dan of a well-to-do funeral\nestablishment. In one corner of the window was a small, edge-lighted\nsign:\n\n    You Never Know What the\n    Next Life Will Be Like.\n\nIn the other corner of the window was a polished black plate with a\ndimly glowing bulb in the center. Around the bulb were the words:\n\n       Your Corrected Charge--\n    Courtesy of Save-Your-Life Co.\n\nA tall, heavily muscled man in a dark-blue cape stepped outside.\n\n\"Good morning, Devisement,\" he said affably. \"I see you're a stranger\nin town. I thought I might mention that our birth rate's rather high\njust now.\" He coughed deferentially. \"You set an example, you know. Our\nmain store is on 122 Center Street, so if you--\"\n\nHe was cut off by a childish scream.\n\nDown the street, a little boy struggled and thrashed near an oblong\nhole at the base of a building, caught in a tangle of the mysterious\nropes.\n\n\"A _kid_!\" cried the man. He sucked in his breath and shouted, \"_Dog!_\nHere, Dog! _Dog!_\"\n\nOn the end of a wharf, a crowd of children was watching the unloading.\nFrom their midst, a lioness burst.\n\n\"_Here_, Dog!\" shouted the man. \"A sweeper! A sweeper! _Run_, Dog!\"\n\nThe lioness burst into a blur of long bounds, shot down the wharf,\nsprang into the street and glanced around with glaring yellow eyes.\n\nThe little boy was partway inside the hole, clinging to the edge with\nboth hands. \"Doggie,\" he sobbed.\n\nThe lioness crouched, sprang into the hole. A crash, a bellow and\na thin scream came from within. The lioness reappeared, its eyes\nglittering and its fur on end. It gripped the little boy by the cape\nand trotted off, growling.\n\n\"Good _dog_!\" cried the man.\n\nMen in the shops' doorways echoed his shout.\n\n\"A _kid_,\" said the man. \"They have to learn sometime, I know, but--\"\nHe cut himself short. \"Well, all's well that ends well.\" He glanced\nrespectfully at Dan. \"If you're here any length of time, sir, we'd\ncertainly appreciate your looking into this. And if you're planning to\nstay long--well, as you see, our sweepers are hungry--our main store\nis on 122 Center Street. Our vacation advisor might be of some service\nto you.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Dan, his throat dry.\n\n\"Not at all, Devisement.\" The man went inside, muttering, \"A _kid_.\"\n\nDan passed several more shops without seeing very much. He turned\nthe corner. Across the street, where the boy had been, was a dented\nbrass plate at the base of the building. On Dan's side of the street,\ntrotting toward him, was a big, tawny-maned lion. Dan hesitated, then\nstarted up the street.\n\nThere was a faint clash of metal.\n\n_Swish-swish._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA net seemed to form in the air and close around him. There was a feel\nof innumerable hairy spiders running over him from head to foot. The\nnet vanished. Something wrapped around his ankle and yanked.\n\nThe lion growled.\n\nThere was a loud _clang_ and Dan's foot was free. He looked down and\nsaw a brass plate labeled SWEEPER.\n\nDan decided it might be a good idea to see the Save-Your-Life Co.'s\nvacation advisor. He started out to locate 122 Center Street and gave\nall brass plates a wide berth on the way.\n\nHe strode through a briskly moving crowd of powerfully built men and\nwomen in capes of various colors, noticing uneasily that they were\nmaking way for him. He studied them as they passed, and saw capes of\nred, green, dark blue, brown, purple, and other shades and combinations\nof colors. But the only sky-blue cape he had seen so far was his own.\n\nA sign on the corner of a building told Dan he was at Center Street. He\ncrossed and the people continued to draw back for him.\n\nIt began to dawn on Dan that he had had the ultimate bad luck for a\nspy in an unknown country: He was marked out on sight as some sort of\nnotable.\n\nJust how bad his luck had been wasn't clear to him till he came to a\nsmall grassy square with an iron fence around it and a man-sized statue\nin the center. The granite base of the statue was inscribed:\n\n    I DEVISE\n\nThe statue itself was of bronze, showing a powerful man, his foot\ncrushing down a mass of snapping monsters. In his right hand, he held\ntogether a large circle of metal, his fingers squeezing shut a cut in\nthe metal, which would break the circle if he let go. His left hand\nmade a partially open fist, into which a wrench had been fitted. The\nstatue itself, protected by some clear finish from the weather, was\nplain brown in color.\n\nBut the statue's cape was enameled sky-blue.\n\nDan stared at the statue for a moment, then looked around. In the\nstreet beside it, a crowd of people was forming, their backs toward him\nand their heads raised. Dan looked up. Far up, near the tops of the\nbuildings, he could make out a long cable stretched from one building\nto another across the street. Just on the other side of the crowd was\nthe entrance to the main store of the Save-Your-Life Co.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDan crossed the street and saw a very average-looking man, wearing an\norange cape, come to a stop at the corner and look shrewdly around.\n\nDan blinked and looked again. _The man in orange was no Porcyn._\n\nThe man's glance fell on the statue and his lips twisted in an amused\nsmile. He looked up toward the rope, then down at the crowd, and then\nstudied the backs of the crowd and the fronts of the stores around him,\nthe lids of his eyes half-closed in a calculating look.\n\nA brass plate nearby popped open, a net of delicate hairy tendrils\nran over him, and something like a length of tarred one-inch rope\nsnaked out and wrapped around his legs. An outraged expression crossed\nhis face. His hand came up. The rope yanked. He fell on the sidewalk.\nThe rope hauled him into the hole. The brass plate snapped shut. From\ninside came a muffled report.\n\nIt occurred to Dan that Galactic was not the only organization\ninterested in Porcys.\n\nDan looked thoughtfully at the brass plate for a moment, then walked\ntoward the entrance of the Save-Your-Life Co., past display windows\nshowing weights, cables, parallel bars, trapezes and giant springs with\nhandles on each end.\n\nHe tried the door. It didn't move.\n\nA clerk immediately opened the door and took Dan along a cool, chaste\nhallway to an office marked \"Vacation Advisor.\" Here a suave-looking\nman made an offhand remark about the birth rate, took a sudden look\nat Dan's cape, blinked, stiffened, glanced at Dan's midsection and\nrelaxed. He went through his files and gave Dan a big photograph\nshowing a smiling, healthy, middle-aged couple and a lovely girl about\nnineteen.\n\n\"These are the Milbuns, sir. Mr. Milbun is a merchant at present.\nQuite well-to-do, I understand. Mrs. Milbun is a housewife right now.\nThe daughter, Mavis, is with a midtown firm at the moment. The mother\nbecame ill at an awkward time. The family put their vacation off for\nher, and as a result their charge has run very low. If you can get to\ntheir apartment without being--ah--swept, I feel sure they will welcome\nyou, sir.\" He scribbled a rough map on a piece of paper, drew an arrow\nand wrote \"6140 Runfast Boulevard, Apartment 6B,\" and stamped the paper\n\"Courtesy of Save-Your-Life Co.\"\n\nThen he wished Dan a healthy vacation and walked with him to hold open\nthe outer door.\n\nDan thanked him and went outside, where the crowd was now almost\nblocking the sidewalk. He forced his way free, saw someone point, and\nglanced at the statue.\n\nThe wrench in the statue's left hand had been replaced by what looked\nlike a magnifying glass.\n\nDan had gone a few steps when there was a thundering cheer, then a\nterrified scream high in the air behind him. He turned around and saw\na man come plummeting down. Dan gaped higher and saw a line of tiny\nfigures going across high up on the rope. One of the figures slipped.\nThere was another cheer.\n\nDan hurriedly turned away.\n\nHe had already convinced himself that the Porcyns had a \"proper\nmercantile attitude.\" And he thought he was beginning to get an idea as\nto how they kept their population down.\n\n\nIV\n\nCarefully avoiding brass plates, Dan made his way along an avenue of\nshops devoted to exercise and physical fitness. He came to Runfast\nBlvd. and located 6140, which looked like the apartment houses he had\nseen earlier.\n\nHe tried the outer door; it was locked. When someone came out, Dan\ncaught the door and stepped in. As the door shut, he tried it and found\nit was locked again. He stood for a moment trying to understand it, but\nhis sleeplessness of the night before was catching up with him. He gave\nup and went inside.\n\nThere were no elevators on the ground floor. Dan had his choice of six\nropes, two ladders and a circular staircase. He went up the staircase\nto the third floor, where he saw a single elevator. He rode it up to\nthe sixth, got off and found that there was a bank of four elevators on\nthis floor.\n\nHe looked at the elevators a minute, felt himself getting dizzy, and\nwalked off to locate apartment 6B.\n\nA powerfully built gray-haired man of middle height answered his\nknock. Dan introduced himself and explained why he had come.\n\nMr. Milbun beamed and his right hand shot forward. Dan felt like a man\nwith his hand caught in an airlock.\n\n\"Lerna!\" called Milbun. \"Lerna! Mavis! We have a guest for vacation!\"\n\nDan became aware of a rhythmical clinking somewhere in the back of the\napartment. Then a big, strong-looking woman, obviously fresh from the\nkitchen, hurried in, smiling. If she had been ill, she was clearly\nrecovered now.\n\n\"Ah, how are you?\" she cried. \"We're so happy to have you!\" She gripped\nhis hand and called, \"_Mavis!_\"\n\nThe clinking stopped. A beautifully proportioned girl came in, wearing\na sweatshirt and shorts. \"Mother, I simply have to get off another\npound or so--Oh!\" She stared at Dan.\n\n\"Mavis,\" said Mr. Milbun, \"this is Mr. Dan Redman. Devisement, my\ndaughter Mavis.\"\n\n\"You're going with us!\" she said happily. \"How wonderful!\"\n\n\"Now,\" said Mr. Milbun, \"I imagine his Devisement wants to get a little\nrest before he goes down to the gym.\" He glanced at Dan. \"We have a\nsplendid gym here.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Mavis eagerly, \"and you can use my weights.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said Dan.\n\n\"We're leaving tomorrow,\" Milbun told him. \"The birth rate's still\nrising here, and last night the charge correction went up again. A\nlittle more and it'll take two of us to get a door open. It won't\ninconvenience you to leave tomorrow?\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Dan.\n\n\"Splendid.\" Milbun turned to his wife. \"Lerna, perhaps our guest would\nlike a little something to eat.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe food was plain, good and plentiful. Afterward, Mavis showed Dan to\nhis room. He sank down gratefully on a firm, comfortable bed. He closed\nhis eyes....\n\nSomeone was shaking him gently.\n\n\"Don't you want to go down to the gym?\" asked Mr. Milbun. \"Remember,\nwe're leaving tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Dan.\n\nFeeling that his brain was functioning in a vacuum, Dan followed the\nMilbuns into the hall, climbed down six stories on a ladder, then into\nthe basement on a rope. He found himself in a room with a stony dirt\ntrack around the wall, ropes festooning the ceiling, an irregularly\nshaped pool, and artificial shrubs and foliage from behind which sprang\nmechanical monsters. The Milbuns promptly vanished behind imitation\nvine-covered doors and came out again in gym clothes.\n\nDan went through the doorway Mr. Milbun had come out of and discovered\nthat the Save-Your-Life Co. had a machine inside which dispensed\nwashed, pressed and sterilized gym clothes for a small fee. The machine\nworked by turning a selector dial to the proper size, pressing a lever,\nand then depositing the correct fee in an open box on the wall nearby.\nDan studied this a moment in puzzlement, guessed his proper size and\nput the correct payment in the box.\n\nHe put on the gym clothes and went outside.\n\nFor forty-five minutes, mechanical creatures of odd and various shapes\nsprang at him from behind shrubbery, gripped him when he passed holes\nin the floor and wound themselves around his legs as he tried to swim\nin the pool.\n\nHis temper worsened. He stopped to look at Mavis as she swayed,\nlaughing, on a rope above two things like mobile giant clamshells.\n\nMr. Milbun shook his head. \"Mavis, remember, we're leaving _tomorrow_.\"\n\nJust then, something snarled and lunged at Dan from the side. There was\na flash of teeth.\n\nDan whirled. His fist shot out. There was a scream of machinery, then\na crash and a clatter. An imitation monster with a huge jaw and giant\nteeth lay on its back on the floor.\n\nMilbun let out a slow whistle. \"_Dismounted_ it. Boy!\"\n\n\"A one-bite, too,\" breathed Mavis.\n\nMrs. Milbun came over and looked at Dan approvingly.\n\nDan had been about to apologize, but checked himself when the others\nsmiled cheerfully and went back to what they were doing. This consisted\nof dodging, tricking or outrunning the various contraptions that lunged\nat them, chased them, tripped them, trailed, stalked and sprang out at\nthem from nearly every place in the room.\n\nFinally the gym began to fill up with other people. The Milbuns got\nready to leave and Dan followed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDan lay in his bed that night and tried to summarize the points he\ndidn't understand. First was the question of vacation. But he supposed\nhe would learn about that tomorrow. Next was \"charge.\" Apparently\none went on vacation when his \"charge\" was low, because the vacation\nadvisor had said, \"The family put their vacation off for her, and as a\nresult their charge has run very low.\" But just what was \"charge\"?\n\nDan remembered the flickering bulb in the store window, ringed by\nthe words \"Your Corrected Charge--Courtesy of Save-Your-Life Co.\"\nApparently he had _some_ charge, because the bulb had flickered. But\nwhere did he get it?\n\nThen he thought of the waterfront and of the little boy caught at the\nhole. What was the point of that? And why did that produce such an\nuproar when, a little later, a grown man could get dragged out of sight\non a well-traveled street and never cause a single notice?\n\nDan felt himself sinking into a maze of confusion. He dismissed the\nproblems and went to sleep clinging to one fact. The Porcyns _must_ be\nhonest people who would keep an agreement, once made. On what other\nplanet could anyone find a slot machine with no slot, but just an open\nbox for the money?\n\nDan fell asleep, content that he had the answer to that part of the\nproblem, at least.\n\nBefore it was light, he awoke to an odd familiar buzz inside his head.\n\n\"Dan,\" said Kielgaard's voice, small and remote.\n\nDan rolled over, lay on his back and spoke sub-vocally. \"Right here.\"\n\n\"Can you talk?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Dan, \"if I can stay awake.\"\n\n\"Can you give us a summary?\"\n\n\"Sure.\" Dan told him briefly what had happened.\n\nKielgaard was silent a moment. Then he said, \"What do you think\n'charge' is?\"\n\n\"I haven't been in any condition to think. Maybe it's a surgically\nimplanted battery, set to run down after so long.\"\n\n\"Too clumsy. What about radioactivity?\"\n\n\"H'm. Yes, you mentioned a mine on the inner planet. Maybe they mine\nradioactive ore. That would explain why I have _some_ charge. There's\nresidual radioactivity even in the atmosphere of Earth.\"\n\n\"That's so,\" said Kielgaard. \"But not every planet has it. I'm\nwondering about this other agent you mentioned seeing. He sounds to me\nlike someone from Trans-Space. And that's bad.\"\n\n\"They play dirty,\" Dan conceded.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Worse than that,\" said Kielgaard's tiny voice. \"They recruit their\nagents from Lassen Two. Maybe that's a break. Unlike Earth, Lassen Two\nis nearly radiation-free. And Trans-Space doesn't use finesse. They'll\npump Porcys full of agents loaded down with organo-transmitters.\nVisual, auditory and olfactory. They'll broadcast on every wave-length,\nsuck out as much information in as short a time as they can, then\neither pull some dirty trick or slam the Porcyns an offer. That is, if\neverything goes according to plan.\n\n\"But meanwhile,\" he added, \"one or more of their agents is bound to\nstand in front of a free 'Your charge' device somewhere in the city.\nVery likely, that agent will be radiation-free and some Porcyn, for\nthe first time in his life, is going to see a bulb that doesn't even\nflicker. If the Porcyns are as scientifically advanced as we think, and\nif Trans-Space is as dirty as usual, there may be a rat-race on before\nwe know it.\"\n\nDan lay gloomily still.\n\n\"Dan,\" said Kielgaard, \"where were you standing in relation to the\nother agent? Did he come up from behind or was he in front of you when\nyou reached the statue?\"\n\n\"I was in front of him. Why?\"\n\n\"Because then you were in his range of vision. _He_ may not have\nnoticed you, but his organo-transmitter would. The chances are you\nappeared on the screen back at Trans-Space headquarters. They record\nthose scenes as they come in and their experts go over them frame by\nframe. Unless you happened to be behind someone, they'll see your image\non the screen, spot you here and there in other scenes from other\nagents, study your actions and recognize you as an agent just as\nsurely as you recognized their agent.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Dan wearily, \"of course they will.\" He was thinking that if\nhe had been more awake yesterday, he would have thought of this himself\nand perhaps avoided it. But he couldn't be alert without sleep and who\ncould sleep in a heaving boat in a thunderstorm?\n\n\"This changes things,\" Kielgaard was saying. \"I'm going to see if we\ncan get a little faster action.\"\n\n\"I think I'd better get some more sleep,\" Dan answered. \"I may need it\ntomorrow.\"\n\n\"I agree,\" said Kielgaard. \"You'll have to keep your eyes open. Good\nnight, Dan, and good luck.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\nDan rolled over on his side. He tried for a moment to remember how\nthe other agent had been standing and whether anyone had been between\nthem to block his view, but he couldn't be sure. Dan decided there was\nnothing to do but assume the worst. He blanked his mind. Soon a feeling\nof deep weariness came over him and he fell asleep.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the morning, Dan and the Milbuns ate a hurried breakfast. Dan helped\nMr. Milbun grease his rowing machine, weights, springs and chinning\nbar, so they wouldn't rust in his absence. Milbun worked in a somber\nmood. All the Milbuns, in fact, were unusually quiet for a family going\non vacation. When they went out into the hall, carrying no baggage,\nthey even took the elevator to the third floor.\n\n\"Better save our strength,\" said Mr. Milbun.\n\nThe street seemed to Dan to have a different atmosphere. People were\nwalking quietly in groups, their eyes cool and alert. The Milbuns\nwalked in front of the apartment houses Dan had passed the day before,\nand across the street he saw the place where the chiseled motto had\nread:\n\n     Freedom\n    Devisement\n    Fraternity\n\nIt was gone. Some workmen nearby were lifting a stone slab onto a cart.\nDan blinked. The motto now read:\n\n    Alertness\n    Devisement\n    Vigilance\n\nThe Milbuns plainly noticed it, too. They drew closer together and\nlooked around thoughtfully. Carefully keeping away from brass plates\nlabeled SWEEPER, they followed a devious route that led to the statue.\n\nThe statue had changed, too. The hand that gripped the circle was now\nhidden by a massive shield. The other hand still held what looked like\na magnifying glass, and the motto was still \"I Devise.\" But the shield\ngave the whole statue a look of strange menace.\n\nAcross the street, near the place where Dan had seen the Trans-Space\nagent, stood several men wearing orange capes, barred black across the\nshoulders. Nearby, the brass plate opened and a man in work clothes\nhanded out a box and went back in.\n\nAt a store entrance up the street, watching them, stood an\naverage-looking man in a purple cape, his look intent and calculating.\n\nMavis glanced at the statue and took Dan's arm. \"Devisement,\" she said,\n\"they won't take you now, will they, before vacation?\"\n\nDan kept an uneasy silence and Mr. Milbun said, \"Of course not, Mavis.\nWhere's the belt?\"\n\nMavis glanced at the statue. \"Oh.\"\n\nDan looked at the statue, then at Mavis and Mr. Milbun, said nothing\nand went on.\n\nThey came to a large building with a long flight of broad wide steps.\nAcross the face of the building was boldly and sternly lettered, high\nup:\n\n    HALL OF TRUTH\n\nLower down was the motto:\n\n        \"Speak the Truth--\n    Live Yet a While With Us.\"\n\n\nV\n\nOn one side of the stairs as they climbed was a statue of a man,\nsmiling. On the other side was an urn with a bunch of carved flowers\nlying beside it.\n\nA big bronze door stood open at the top. They walked through into a\nlarge chamber with massive seats in triple rows along two walls, and a\nsingle row of yet more massive seats raised along the farther wall.\n\nA bored-looking man got up from a low desk as the Milbuns sat down in\nthree of the massive seats.\n\nThe man asked in a dreary voice, \"Have you, to the best of your\nknowledge, committed any wrong or illegal act or acts since your last\nvacation?\" He picked up a whiskbroom and pan and waited for their\nanswers.\n\n\"No,\" said the three Milbuns in earnest quavering voices.\n\nThe man looked at each of them, shrugged and said boredly, \"Pass\nthrough to your vacations, live law-abiding citizens.\" He beckoned\nimpatiently to Dan, turned to scowl at him, saw Dan's cape, stiffened,\nlooked hastily out to the statue framed by the doorway, relaxed\nslightly and inquired respectfully, \"Is it time for you to go on\nvacation, Devisement?\"\n\n\"It seems to be,\" said Dan.\n\n\"I think you should, sir. Then you'd be still more helpful if called.\"\n\nDan nodded noncommittally and sat down in one of the massive chairs.\nHis glance fell on an ornamental carving above the big doorway. It was\na set of scales held by a giant hand. In one pan of the scales sat a\nsmiling man. In the other was a small heap of ashes.\n\n\"Have you,\" asked the bored man, \"to the best of your knowledge,\ncommitted any wrong or illegal act or acts since your last vacation?\"\n\nHe readied the dustpan and whiskbroom.\n\nThe Milbuns watched anxiously at a door in the back of the room.\n\nUneasily, Dan thought back and remembered no wrong or illegal acts he\nhad committed since his last vacation.\n\n\"No,\" he said.\n\nThe functionary stepped back. \"Pass through to your vacation, live\nlaw-abiding citizen, sir.\"\n\nDan got up and walked toward the Milbuns. Another bored functionary\ncame in wheeling a cartful of urns. He stopped at a massive chair with\na heap of ashes on the seat, a small pile on either arm, and two small\npiles at the foot. The functionary swept the ashes off and dumped them\nin the urn.\n\nA cold sensation went through Dan. He followed the Milbuns out into a\nsmall room.\n\nHe felt an out-of-focus sensation and realized the room was a mataform\ntransmitter. An instant later, they were in a spaceship crowded with\nthoughtful-looking people.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLife on the spaceship seemed to be given over to silent, morose\nmeditation, with an occasional groan that sounded very much like, \"Oh,\ngive me just one more chance, God.\"\n\nWhen they left the ship, it was again by mataform, this time to a\nbuilding where they stood in a line of people. The line wound through\na booth where the color of their capes was marked on their foreheads,\nthence past a counter where they received strong khaki-colored capes,\nblouses and hose, and new leather shorts and boots to replace those\nthey were wearing. They changed in tiny private rooms, handed their\nown clothing in at another counter, had a number stamped on their left\nshoulders and on their boxes of clothing.\n\nThen they walked out onto a strip of brilliant white sand, fronting on\nan inlet of sparkling blue water.\n\nHere and there huddled little crowded knots of people, dancing from one\nfoot to another on the hot sand and yet apparently afraid to go in the\nwater. Dan looked to the Milbuns for some clue and saw them darting\nintense calculating glances at the beach and the water.\n\nThen Mr. Milbun yelled, \"_Run for it!_\"\n\nA slavering sound reached Dan's ear. He sprinted after the Milbuns,\nburst through the crowd in a headlong bolt for the cove, then swam as\nfast as he could to keep up with them as they raced for the opposite\nshore. They crawled out, strangling and gasping, and dragged themselves\nup on the sand. Dan lay, heaving in deep breaths, then rolled over and\nsat up.\n\nThe air around them was split by screams, laced through with sobs,\ncurses and groans. On the shore opposite, a mad dog darted across\nthe crowded beach and emptied people into the cove. In the cove, a\nglistening black sweep of hide separated the water for an instant, then\nsank below. People thrashed, fought and went under.\n\nDan looked up. On the wooden building beyond the cove and the beach was\na broad sign:\n\n       PORCYS PLANET\n    REJUVENATION CENTER\n\nDan read the sign three times. If this was rejuvenation, the Porcyns\ncould have it.\n\nBeside Dan, Milbun stood up, still struggling for breath, and pulled\nhis wife and Mavis to their feet.\n\n\"Come on,\" he said. \"We've _got_ to get through the swamp ahead of the\ngrayboas!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe rest of the day, they pushed through slimy muck up to their knees\nand sometimes up to their necks. Behind them, the crowd screamingly\nthinned out.\n\nThat night, they washed in icy spring water, tore chunks of meat from\na huge broiled creature turning on a spit and went to sleep in tents\nto the buzz and drone of creatures that shot their long needle noses\nthrough the walls like drillers hunting for oil.\n\nThe following day, they spent carefully easing from crevice to narrow\ntoehold up the sheer face of a mountain. Food and shelter were at the\ntop. Jagged rocks and hungry creatures were at the bottom. That night,\nDan slept right through an urgent buzz from Kielgaard. The next night,\nhe woke enough to hear it, but he didn't have the strength to answer.\n\nWhere, he thought, is the rejuvenation in this?\n\nThen he had a sudden glimmering. It was the Porcyn _race_ that was\nrejuvenated. The unfit of the Porcyns died violently. It took stamina\njust to live from one day to the next.\n\nEven the Milbuns were saying that this was the worst vacation ever.\nTrails slid out from under them. Trees fell toward them. Boulders\nbounded down steep slopes at them.\n\nAt first, the Milbuns tried to remember forgotten sins for which all\nthis might be repayment. But when there was the dull _boom_ of an\nexplosion and they narrowly escaped a landslide, Milbun looked at the\nrocks across the trail with sunken red eyes. He sniffed the air and\ngrowled, \"Undevised.\"\n\nThat afternoon, Dan and the Milbuns passed three average-looking men\nhanging by their hands from the limb of a tree beside the trail.\nThe faces of the hanging men bore a surprised expression. They hung\nperfectly still and motionless, except for a slight swaying caused by\nthe wind.\n\nDan and the Milbuns reached a mataform station late that afternoon.\n\nA very hard-eyed guard in an orange cape, barred across the shoulders\nin black, let them through and they found themselves in another\nspaceship, bound for Fumidor, the mining planet.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDan sat back exhausted and fell asleep. He was awakened by a determined\nbuzz.\n\n\"_Dan!_\" said Kielgaard's voice.\n\n\"Yes.\" Dan sat up. \"Go ahead.\"\n\n\"Trans-Space is going to try to take over Porcys. There's nothing you\ncan do about that, but they've landed agents on Vacation Planet to pick\nyou off. Look out.\"\n\nDan told Kielgaard what had happened to the agents on Vacation Planet,\nsuch as the \"undevised\" explosion and being hung up by the hands.\n\nKielgaard whistled. \"Maybe the Porcyns can take care of themselves.\nTrans-Space doesn't think so.\"\n\n\"How did you find out?\"\n\nThe tiny voice held a note of grim satisfaction. \"They ran an agent in\non us and he gave himself away. He went back with an organo-transmitter\ninside him, and a memory bank. The bank stores up the day's\nimpressions. The transmitter squirts them out in one multi-frequency\nblast. The agent is poorly placed for an informant, but we've learned a\nlot through him.\"\n\n\"How are they going to take over Porcys?\"\n\n\"We don't know. They think they've found the Porcyns' weak point, but\nif so, we don't know what it is.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" urged Dan, \"maybe _we_ ought to put a lot of agents on\nPorcys.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Kielgaard. \"That's the wrong way to play it. If we go in\nnow, we'll be too late to do any good. We're still counting on you.\"\n\n\"There's not very much I can do by myself.\"\n\n\"Just do your best. That's all we can ask.\"\n\nDan spent the next week chipping out pieces of a radioactive ore. At\nnight, Kielgaard would report the jubilant mood of Trans-Space. On\nthe following days, Dan would chop at the ore with vicious blows that\njarred him from his wrists to his heels.\n\nThe steady monotonous work, once he was used to it, left his mind free\nto think and he tried furiously to plan what he would do when he got\nout. But he found he didn't really know enough about Porcys to make a\nsensible plan. Then he began trying to organize what he had seen and\nheard during his stay on the planet. At night, Kielgaard helped him and\ntogether they went over their theories, trying to find those that would\nfit the facts of Porcys.\n\n\"It all hinges on population pressure,\" said Kielgaard finally. \"On\nmost planets we know of, overpopulation leads to war, starvation,\nbirth control or emigration. These are the only ways. At least, they\nwere, till we discovered Porcys.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"All right,\" agreed Dan. \"Grant that. The Porcyns plainly don't have\nany of those things, or not to any great extent. Instead, they have\ninstitutions such as we've never seen before. They have 'sweepers,'\nso-called 'vacations' and a rope from building to building. All these\nthings cut down population.\"\n\n\"Don't forget their 'truth chairs,'\" said Kielgaard.\n\n\"Where you either tell the truth or get converted to ashes--yes. But\nhow does it all fit in?\"\n\n\"Let's take one individual as an example. Start at birth.\"\n\n\"He's born,\" said Dan. \"Probably they have nurseries, but we know they\nstick together as families, because we have the Milbuns to go by. He\ngrows up, living at his parents' place. He goes with other children to\nschool or to see different parts of his city. A lion--which he calls a\n'dog'--protects him.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Kielgaard. \"It protects him from sweepers. But most\ngrownups don't need protection. Only those whose charge is low.\"\n\n\"Of course. The boy hasn't been on vacation yet. He's not radioactive.\nApparently you have to be radioactive to open doors. At the apartment\nhouse, the boy comes in a small door to one side. The lions, or what\nresemble lions, like the children but don't like the sweepers. And the\nsweepers are afraid of them. All right. But what about when he grows\nup?\"\n\n\"Well, for one thing, he has to use the regular doors now. And they\nwon't open unless he's been on vacation. And if he hasn't been on\nvacation and if his charge isn't high, the sweepers will go out and\ngrab him. That must be what that sign you saw meant. 'Swept' was a\nwarning that there was no escape in that direction.\"\n\n\"I begin to see it,\" said Dan. \"I was safe on that road because the\nbirth rate in that section wasn't high. But in the city, the birth rate\n_was_ high, so, to keep the population down, the standards were raised.\nApparently the sweepers were fed less and got more hungry. People had\nto go on vacation more often. But what about the rope?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I don't think we really know enough to understand the rope,\" said\nKielgaard, \"but maybe it's a face-saving device. People who don't think\nthey're in good enough shape to get through 'vacation,' and who don't\nwant to die a slow death avoiding sweepers and waiting to go through\nlocked doors, can go across on the rope. Or perhaps it's a penance. If\na man has done something wrong and he's afraid to deny it in the truth\nchair, perhaps he's allowed to confess and go so many times across the\nrope as punishment. The people cheered. That must mean it's honorable.\"\n\n\"That makes sense,\" Dan agreed. \"All right, but why don't they just\nship their surplus population to the other two planets?\"\n\n\"We've studied that back here,\" said Kielgaard. \"We think it's because\nthey wouldn't dare. They've got their little mainland allotted and\nrationed down to the last blade of grass. They can do that because it's\nsmall enough to keep control of. Now suppose they try to enforce the\nsame system on a new planet with a hundred times the land area--what's\ngoing to happen? They'll have unknown, uncontrollable factors to deal\nwith. Their system will break down. That statue of theirs shows they\nknow it, too. The man in the blue cape 'devises' and his strong right\nhand does nothing but keep the circle--their system--from flying apart.\nWhat puzzles me is that they're satisfied with it.\"\n\n\"There's another point,\" Dan said, \"but I think I see it now. They've\ngot a caste system, but people must be able to move from one caste to\nanother. There must be a competitive exam or some system of choice.\nThe vacation advisor said Mr. Milbun was 'at present' a merchant. His\nwife was 'now' a housewife. And no one ever asked my name, though I\ntold it voluntarily to Milbun. It was always 'Yes, Devisement,' or 'Is\nit time to take your vacation, Devisement?' There were no personal\ntitles like 'Sir Moglin,' or 'First Magistrate Moglin,' such as we've\nencountered on other planets.\"\n\nKielgaard grunted. \"That would explain the differently colored capes,\ntoo. No one would care if a man was a street-cleaner ten years ago.\nThey'd see his cape was blue and give him immediate, automatic respect.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Dan. \"That's it. And no one would dare _cheat_ about\nthe color of the cape he wore, because, regardless of his position,\nsooner or later his charge would be gone. Then he would have to go on\nvacation. And to do _that_, he _has_ to sit in the truth chair and tell\nthe truth or get incinerated.\" Dan stopped suddenly and sucked in a\ndeep breath.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" asked Kielgaard.\n\n\"_That's_ the weak point.\"\n\n\nVI\n\nBy the end of the week, Dan was able to pass through a door with a\nspecialized type of Geiger counter in the locking circuit.\n\nAnd by that time, Kielgaard had noted sharp fluctuations in the mood\nat Trans-Space. There had been an interval of wild confusion, but it\nhadn't lasted. Many more Trans-Space agents had gone to Porcys and\nTrans-Space seemed to be on top again.\n\nThe instant Dan stepped from the mines through the door marked \"Out,\"\nhe was rushed through a shower, a shave and a haircut, shoved into\na truth chair and asked questions, given a new cape and clothes,\nand buckled into a glittering belt by a purple-caped man addressed\nas \"Reverence.\" No sooner was the belt in place than all, including\n\"Reverence,\" snapped to attention.\n\n\"Devisement,\" said a man in an orange-and-black cape, \"we need your\ndecision quickly. At home, men have usurped cloaks of devisement and\ngiven orders contrary to the public good. They wore belts of power, but\ndid not die when their false orders were given. In the Central City,\nthey convened a council, seated themselves in the Hall of Truth, and on\nthe very first oath every single one of them present was thrown into\nthe life beyond.\n\n\"Because the statue was already belted, men wearing cloaks of\ndevisement _had_ to give the orders. But now they were all gone.\nLooters roamed the streets, breaking in doors. These men were\nvacation-dodgers--out so long that they couldn't even make a\ncharge-light flicker--and the sweepers cleaned up some of them. _But\nthey killed the sweepers!_ Devisement, I tell you the truth!\"\n\n\"I believe you,\" said Dan.\n\n\"Thank heaven. Devisement, something must be done. A young boy passed\nand graduated to the devisement cape, but before he could take action,\nhe was shot from ambush. We found an old man of the right cape out\nin the country, and when we finally convinced him, he rounded up one\nhundred and fifty-seven vacation-dodgers and executed them. We had\nthings in order, but now a glut of lunatics in devisement capes and\nbelts of power have burst into the streets. Their orders are silly, yet\ntheir belts don't kill them. They have no fear of the Truth. Business\nis stopped and men are hungry. The people are going wild. Strange boats\nhave appeared offshore. Mataform transmitters of odd design are being\nset up near the shore. This cannot go on without breaking the circle!\"\n\nDan's throat felt dry.\n\n\"Sir,\" said the Porcyn desperately, \"you _must_ devise something! What\nshall we do?\"\n\nA faint tingling at Dan's waist suggested to him that he choose his\nwords carefully. One lie or bad intention and the belt of power would\nprobably finish him.\n\nHe thought carefully. The total power of the Porcyn planet must be at\nleast the equal of even the huge Trans-Space organization. And Porcys\nhad its power all in one place. The planet was organized to the last\nounce of energy, if only it could be brought to bear in time.\n\nDan ordered his anxious companions to take him to Porcys.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFar under the Central City, which was the city he had seen, he found\na weary, powerful old man in a light-blue cape and glittering belt,\ndirecting operations from a television command post. The console\nshowed street scenes of men in sky-blue capes and flashing belts, who\ndanced and jabbered, their faces aglow with lunacy as they rapped out\nconflicting orders and the people jerked and dashed this way and that,\ntears running down their faces.\n\nNear the statue, before the Hall of Truth, close ranks of Porcyn men in\norange-and-black capes stood massed on the steps, holding sleek-bored\nguns. On the street below, gibbering lunatics in sky-blue danced and\nshrieked orders, but the eyes of the men on the steps were tightly\nshut. By a technicality, they avoided obedience to the lunacy, for\nwith their eyes shut, how could they be sure who gave the command?\n\nAt the belted statue itself, a man in blue was clinging to one bronze\narm as he slammed down a hammer to knock loose the partly broken\ncircle. The statue obstinately refused to let go. At the base of\nthe statue, holding a microphone, stood an average-looking man in a\nsky-blue cape, his lips drawn back in an amused smile. He gestured to\nmen with crowbars and they tried to jam them between the statue and its\nbase. This failing, they took up chisels and hammers. The man working\non the circle shrugged and jumped down.\n\nAt the console, the old man looked up at Dan. He put his hand out and\nfelt Dan's belt. Apparently the tingle reassured him and he seemed to\naccept Dan without further question.\n\n\"This is about the end,\" he said. \"When that statue goes, those men\nwill feel the jolt and open their eyes. They're the last formed body of\ntroops on the planet, and when they go, we'll have nothing to strike\nwith. There must be something I could devise for this, but I've been up\nthree nights and I can't think.\"\n\n\"Can you delay it?\" asked Dan, grappling with the beginning of his plan.\n\n\"Oh, we'll delay it. I've got the last of the sweepers collected at\nthe holes opening into the square. Just when that statue begins to tip,\nI'll let the sweepers out. That will stop things for a while. Then\nthey'll kill the sweepers and my bolt is shot.\"\n\n\"Won't the men you've got here fire on those blue-caped fakes?\"\n\n\"Devisement,\" said the old man, shaking his head, \"you know better.\"\n\n\"Are there any fire hoses? Will your men squirt water on the blue-caped\nones?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the old man, leaning forward. \"They'll get shot. But yes,\nthey will. What is it? What are you devising?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDan outlined his plan. The old man's eyes lighted. He nodded and Dan\nwent out and climbed with guides through a grim, dark tunnel where the\nsweepers were kept. He peered out the hole, and as across the street\nthe statue began to tip, he burst outside and sprinted into the square.\n\nThe Trans-Space leader raised his microphone.\n\nDan ripped it out of his hand and knocked him off his feet, then knelt\nand picked up the heavy shield that had been taken off the statue to\nget at the ring.\n\nA bullet hummed over Dan's head.\n\nWith a rush of air and a heavy smash, the statue landed full length on\nthe ground. Dan hauled himself up onto its base. Another bullet buzzed\npast him. Then there was a yell, and Dan looked down in the street.\n\nThe sweepers were horrible as they poured from their holes, but they\nlooked almost beautiful to Dan. He glanced at the Porcyns massed on the\nsteps, their faces white with near-hysteria. Their eyes were open and\nwatching him; the Trans-Space men were too busy to give orders.\n\nDan raised the microphone and his voice boomed out:\n\n\"_Close your eyes till you hear the roar of the lion! Then obey your\ntrue leaders!_\"\n\nHe repeated the order three times before it dawned on the Trans-Space\ntechnicians that this was not according to plan. The loudspeaker gave\na booming click and cut off. By then, the sweepers had been killed and\nDan became aware of bullets thrumming past him. Suddenly he felt weak\nwith panic that the rest of the plan had fallen apart.\n\nUp the street, Porcyn men were unscrewing a cap on the face of a\nbuilding. They connected a hose. A sky-blue-caped Trans-Space agent\nordered them away. The Porcyns turned, wads of wax in their ears, and\nraised the hose.\n\nA stream of water knocked the agents backward. Shots rang out. Porcyns\nfell, but other Porcyns took their places. The stream arched and fell\non the Trans-Space agents and abruptly a whirl of color tinged the\nwater. Blots and blobs of green, orange, pink and yellow spattered the\nblue-caped agents.\n\nAt the end of the street, someone ran up tugging a lion by the mane.\n\n\"_Go_, dog! _Run!_\"\n\nSomewhere a child cried out in terror.\n\nThe lion roared.\n\nThe troops on the steps opened their eyes.\n\nAn old man's voice, amplified, spoke out with icy authority:\n\n\"_Deploy for street-fighting! First rank, move out along Center Street\ntoward North Viaduct. Rifles at full charge. Wide intervals. Use every\nscrap of cover. Shoot the false-belted usurpers on sight._\n\n\"_Second rank, move out along West Ocean Avenue toward the sea\nwall...._\"\n\nShots rang out.\n\nThere was a faint thrumming hum, like wires in the wind, and streaks of\ncherry radiance criss-crossed in the air.\n\nThe lion roared, unable to find the child. The roars of other lions\njoined in.\n\nDan was aware that he was lying atop the hard base of the statue, but\nhe didn't know how he had come to be there. He tried to stand up.\n\nHe heard voices screaming orders, then falling still, and a scene swung\ninto his line of sight like something watched through the rear-view\nmirror of a turning groundcar.\n\nHalf a dozen men, guns in their hands, their bodies and blue capes\nspattered and smeared till they could hardly be recognized, lay\nmotionless on the pavement\n\nThen the scene swung up and away, and Dan felt weightless. Something\nhit him hard. His head bounced and he rolled over. Soft grass was in\nhis face. It smelled fresh.\n\nThere was a dull boom that moved the ground under him.\n\nHe twisted his head to look up.\n\nA massive arm was stretched out over him, its hand firmly gripping the\ncut edges of a big metal ring.\n\nSomewhere a drum took up a steady monotonous beat.\n\nHe fell into a deep black quiet and all the sights and sounds grew\nsmaller and fainter and disappeared entirely.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe awoke in a Porcyn hospital. Kielgaard was there, wearing a broad\ngrin and brilliant Porcyn clothes and promising Dan a huge bonus. But\nit was all like a dream.\n\nKielgaard said the Porcyns were as mad as hornets. They had raised a\nbattle fleet and it had taken a corps of diplomats and the Combined\nIntergalactic Space Fleet to argue them out of personally chopping\nTrans-Space into fine bits. No one knew what would finally happen, but\nmeanwhile Galactic had its contract and everyone was tentatively happy.\n\nHis account finished, Kielgaard grinned more broadly yet and switched\non a bedside televiewer.\n\nDan lifted his head off the pillow and looked at the screen. Then he\nstared.\n\nIt was the statue, solid once more on its base, the ring grasped\nfirmly in one hand and a big wrench in the other. But something seemed\ndifferent.\n\nDan at last saw what it was.\n\nIt was the face. It wasn't a bad face, if one expected to see strong\ncheekbones, copper skin and a high-arched nose.\n\n\"What a compliment!\" he said, embarrassedly pleased. \"I--hell, I feel\nlike blushing.\"\n\n\"Make it a good one,\" said Kielgaard. \"After tomorrow, you'll have to\nblush with your own face again.\"\n\n\"_Tomorrow?_\"\n\n\"Sure. You're still working for us, remember.\"\n\nDan sank back on the pillow and gazed up speculatively at the ceiling.\n\"All right, but I want some time off. I have a fat bonus to spend.\"\n\n\"You could use a holiday,\" Kielgaard agreed. \"Why not try the\nAndromedan cloud gardens? Pretty expensive, but with your bonus--\"\n\n\"I've got a place picked out,\" said Dan. \"I'm going to take a vacation\non Porcys.\"\n\nKielgaard started. \"You're joking! Or you've gone twitchy!\"\n\n\"No. Before I have to give this face back to Surgery, I ought to get\na _little_ enjoyment out of it. And what could be more enjoyable than\nhanging around the statue, letting people see the resemblance? Besides,\nthey can't make me take my vacation on the Vacation Planet--I've\nalready had it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Advance Agent, by Christopher Anvil\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ADVANCE AGENT ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51273.txt or 51273.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/2/7/51273/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
