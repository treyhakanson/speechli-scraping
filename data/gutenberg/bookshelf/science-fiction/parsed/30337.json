LANGART\n\n\n     _That he was a phony Swami was beyond doubt. That he was a\n      genuine prophet, though, seemed ... but then, what's the\n      difference between a dictator and a true prophet? So was\n      he...._\n\n\n                      Illustrated by Schoenherr\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nDr. Joachim sat in the small room behind his reception hall and held\nhis fingers poised above the keys of the rather creaky electrotyper on\nhis desk. The hands seemed to hang there, long, slender, and pale,\nlike two gulls frozen suddenly in their long swoop towards some\nprecious tidbit floating on the writhing sea beneath, ready to begin\ntheir drop instantly, as soon as time began again.\n\nAll of Dr. Joachim's body seemed to be held in that same stasis. Only\nhis lips moved as he silently framed the next sentence in his mind.\n\nPhysically, the good doctor could be called a big man: he was\nbroad-shouldered and well-muscled, but, hidden as his body was beneath\nthe folds of his blue, monkish robe, only his shortness of stature was\nnoticeable. He was only fifty-four, but the pale face, the full,\nflowing beard, and the long white hair topped by a small blue skullcap\ngave him an ageless look, as though centuries of time had flowed over\nhim to leave behind only the marks of experience and wisdom.\n\nThe timelessness of an idealized Methuselah as he approached his ninth\ncentennial, the God-given wisdom engraved on the face of Moses as he\ncame down from Sinai, the mystic power of mighty Merlin as he softly\nintoned a spell of albamancy, all these seemed to have been blended\ncarefully together and infused into the man who sat behind the typer,\ncomposing sentences in his head.\n\nThose gull-hands swooped suddenly to the keyboard, and the aged\nmachine clattered rapidly for nearly a minute before Dr. Joachim\npaused again to consider his next words.\n\nA bell tinkled softly.\n\nDr. Joachim's brown eyes glanced quickly at the image on the\nblack-and-white TV screen set in the wall. It was connected to the\nhidden camera in his front room, and showed a woman entering his front\ndoor. He sighed and rose from his seat, adjusting his blue robes\ncarefully before he went to the door that led into the outer room.\n\nHe'd rather hoped it was a client, but--\n\n\"Hello, Susan, my dear,\" he said in a soft baritone, as he stepped\nthrough the door. \"What seems to be the trouble?\"\n\nIt wasn't the same line that he'd have used with a client. You don't\nask a mark questions; you tell him. To a mark, he'd have said: \"Ah,\nyou are troubled.\" It sounds much more authoritative and all-knowing.\n\nBut Cherrie Tart--_n\u00e9e_ Sue Kowalski--was one of the best strippers on\nthe Boardwalk. Her winters were spent in Florida or Nevada or Puerto\nRico, but in summer she always returned to King Frankie's _Golden\nSurf_, for the summer trade at Coney Island. She might be a big name\nin show business now, but she had never forgotten her carny\nbackground, and King Frankie, in spite of the ultra-ultra tone of the\n_Golden Surf_, still stuck to the old Minsky traditions.\n\nThe worried look on her too-perfect face had been easily visible in\nthe TV screen, but it had been replaced by a bright smile as soon as\nshe had heard Dr. Joachim opening the door. The smile flickered for a\nmoment, then she said: \"Gee, Doc; you give a girl the creepy feeling\nthat you really _can_ read her mind.\"\n\nDr. Joachim merely smiled. Susan might be with it, but a good mitt man\ndoesn't give away _all_ his little secrets. He had often wished that\nhe could really read minds--he had heard rumors of men who could--but\na little well-applied psychology is sometimes just as good.\n\n\"So how's everything been, Doc?\" She smiled her best stage\nsmile--every tooth perfect in that perfect face, her hair framing the\nwhole like a perfect golden helmet. She looked like a girl in her\nearly twenties, but Dr. Joachim knew for a fact that she'd been born\nin 1955, which made her thirty-two next January.\n\n\"Reasonably well, all things considered,\" Dr. Joachim admitted. \"I'm\nnot starving to death, at least.\"\n\nShe looked around at the room--the heavy drapes, the signs of the\nzodiac in gold and silver, the big, over-stuffed chairs, all designed\nto make the \"clients\" feel comfortable and yet slightly awed by the\nancient atmosphere of mysticism. In the dim light, they looked fairly\nimpressive, but she knew that if the lights were brighter the\nshabbiness would show.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Maybe you could use a redecorating job, then, Doc,\" she said. With a\ngesture born of sudden impulse, she reached into her purse and pulled\nout an envelope and pressed it into the man's hands. He started to\nprotest, but she cut him off. \"No, Doc; I want you to have it. You\nearned it.\n\n\"That San Juan-New York flight, remember?\" she went on hurriedly. \"You\nsaid not to take it, remember? Well, I ... I sort of forgot about what\nyou'd said. You know. Anyway, I got a ticket and was ready to go when\nthe flight was suddenly delayed. Routine, they said. Checking the\nengines. But I'd never heard of any such routine as that. I remembered\nwhat you told me, Doc, and I got scared.\n\n\"After an hour, they put another plane into service; they were still\nworking on the other one. I was still worried, so I decided to wait\ntill the next day.\n\n\"I guess you read what happened.\"\n\nHe closed his eyes and nodded slowly. \"I read.\"\n\n\"Doc, I'd've been on that flight if you hadn't warned me. All the\nmoney in the world isn't enough to pay for that.\" The oddly worried\nlook had come back into her eyes. \"Doc, I don't know how you knew that\nship was going to go, and I won't ask. I don't want to know. But, ...\none thing: Was it _me_ they were after?\"\n\n_She thinks someone blew up the ship_, he thought. _She thinks I heard\nabout the plot some way._ For an instant he hesitated, then:\n\n\"No, Susan; they weren't after you. No one was trying to kill you.\nDon't worry about it.\"\n\nRelief washed over her face. \"O.K., Doc; if you say so. Look, I've got\nto run now, but we've got to sit down and have a few drinks together,\nnow that I'm back. And ... Doc--\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Anytime you need anything--if I can ever help you--you let me know,\nhuh?\"\n\n\"Certainly, my dear. And don't you worry about anything. The stars are\nall on your side right now.\"\n\nShe smiled, patted his hand, and then was gone in a flash of gold and\nhoney. Dr. Joachim looked at the door that had closed behind her, then\nhe looked down at the envelope in his hands. He opened it gently and\ntook out the sheaf of bills. Fifteen hundred dollars!\n\nHe smiled and shoved the money into his pocket. After all, he _was_ a\nprofessional fortuneteller, even if he didn't like that particular\nlabel, and he _had_ saved her life, hadn't he?\n\nHe returned to the small back room, sat down again at the typer, and,\nafter a minute, began typing again.\n\nWhen he was finished, he addressed an envelope and put the letter\ninside.\n\nIt was signed with his legal name: _Peter J. Forsythe_.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt required less than two hours for that letter to end up at its\ndestination in a six-floor brick building, a rather old-fashioned\naffair that stood among similar structures in a lower-middle-class\nsection of Arlington, Virginia, hardly a hop-skip-and-jump from the\nPentagon, and not much farther from the Capitol.\n\nThe letter was addressed to _Mr. J. Harlan Balfour, President, The\nSociety for Mystical and Metaphysical Research, Inc._, but Mr. Balfour\nwas not at the Society's headquarters at the time, having been called\nto Los Angeles to address a group who were awaiting the Incarnation of\nGod.\n\nEven if he had been there, the letter wouldn't have reached him first.\nAll mail was sent first to the office of the Executive Secretary, Mr.\nBrian Taggert. Most of it--somewhat better than ninety-nine per\ncent--went directly on to Mr. Balfour's desk, if it was so addressed;\nBrian Taggert would never have been so cruel as to deprive Mr. Balfour\nof the joy of sorting through the thousands of crackpot letters in\nsearch of those who had the true spark of mysticism which so\nfascinated Mr. Balfour.\n\nMr. Balfour was a crackpot, and it was his job to take care of other\ncrackpots--a job he enjoyed immensely and wholeheartedly, feeling, as\nhe did, that that sort of thing was the only reason for the Society's\nexistence. Of course, Mr. Balfour never considered himself or the\nothers in the least bit crackpottish, in which he was just as much in\nerror as he was in his assumption of the Society's _raison d'\u00eatre_.\n\nNinety per cent of the members of the Society for Mystical and\nMetaphysical Research were just what you would expect them to be.\nAnyone who was \"truly interested in the investigation of the\nsupranormal\", as the ads in certain magazines put it, could pay five\ndollars a year for membership, which, among other things, entitled\nhim to the Society's monthly magazine, _The Metaphysicist_, a\nwell-printed, conservative-looking publication which contained\narticles on everything from the latest flying saucer report to careful\nmathematical evaluations of the statistical methods of the Rhine\nFoundation. Within its broad field, the magazine was quite catholic in\nits editorial policy.\n\nThese members constituted a very effective screen for the real work of\nthe society, work carried on by the \"core\" members, most of whom\nweren't even listed on the membership rolls. And yet, it was this\ngroup of men and women who made the Society's title true.\n\nMr. Brian Taggert was a long way from being a crackpot. The big,\ndark-haired, dark-eyed, hawknosed man sat at his desk in his office on\nthe fifth floor of the Society's building and checked over the mail.\nNormally, his big wrestler's body was to be found quietly relaxed on\nthe couch that stood against a nearby wall. Not that he was in any way\naverse to action; he simply saw no virtue in purposeless action. Nor\ndid he believe in the dictum of Miles Standish; if he wanted a thing\ndone, he sent the man most qualified to do it, whether that was\nhimself or someone else.\n\nWhen he came to the letter from Coney Island, New York, he read it\nquickly and then jabbed at a button on the intercom switchboard in his\ndesktop. He said three syllables which would have been meaningless to\nanyone except the few who understood that sort of verbal shorthand,\nreleased the button, and closed his eyes, putting himself in\ntelepathic contact with certain of the Society's agents in New York.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAcross the river, in the Senate Office Building, a telephone rang in\nthe office of Senator Mikhail Kerotski, head of the Senate Committee\non Space Exploration. It was an unlisted, visionless phone, and the\nnumber was known only to a very few important officials in the United\nStates Government, so the senator didn't bother to identify himself;\nhe simply said: \"Hello.\" He listened for a moment, said, \"O.K., fine,\"\nin a quiet voice, and cut the connection.\n\nHe sat behind his desk for a few minutes longer, a bearlike man with a\nround, pale face and eyes circled with dark rings and heavy pouches,\nall of which had the effect of making him look like a rather sleepy\nspecimen of the giant panda. He finished the few papers he had been\nworking on, stacked them together, rose, and went into the outer\noffice, where he told his staff that he was going out for a short\nwalk.\n\nBy the time he arrived at the brownstone building in Arlington and was\npushing open the door of Brian Taggert's office, Taggert had received\nreports from New York and had started other chains of action. As soon\nas Senator Kerotski came in, Taggert pushed the letter across the desk\ntoward him. \"Check that.\"\n\nKerotski read the letter, and a look of relief came over his round\nface. \"Not the same typewriter or paper, but this is him, all right.\nWhat more do we know?\"\n\n\"Plenty. Hold on, and I'll give you a complete rundown.\" He picked up\nthe telephone and began speaking in a low voice. It was an\nordinary-sounding conversation; even if the wire had been tapped, no\none who was not a \"core\" member of the S.M.M.R. would have known that\nthe conversation was about anything but an esoteric article to be\nprinted in _The Metaphysicist_--something about dowsing rods.\n\nThe core membership had one thing in common: _understanding_.\n\nConsider plutonium. Imagine someone dropping milligram-sized pellets\nof the metal into an ordinary Florence flask. (In an inert atmosphere,\nof course; there is no point in ruining a good analogy with side\nreactions.) More than two and a half million of those little pellets\ncould be dropped into the flask without the operator having anything\nmore to worry about than if he were dropping grains of lead or gold\ninto the container. But after the five millionth, dropping them in by\nhand would only be done by the ignorant, the stupid, or the\nindestructible. A qualitative change takes place.\n\nSo with understanding. As a human mind increases its ability to\nunderstand another human mind, it eventually reaches a critical point,\nand the mind itself changes. And, at that point, the Greek letter\n_psi_ ceases to be a symbol for the unknown.\n\nWhen understanding has passed the critical point, conversation as it\nis carried on by most human beings becomes unnecessarily redundant.\nEven in ordinary conversation, a single gesture--a shrug of the\nshoulders, a snap of the fingers, or a nose pinched between thumb and\nforefinger--can express an idea that would take many words and much\nmore time. A single word--\"slob,\" \"nazi,\" \"saint\"--can be more\ndescriptive than the dozens of words required to define it. All that\nis required is that the meanings of the symbols be understood.\n\nThe ability to manipulate symbols is the most powerful tool of the\nhuman mind; a mind which can manipulate them _effectively_ is, in\nevery sense of the word, truly human.\n\nEven without telepathy, it was possible for two S.M.M.R. agents to\ncarry on a conversation above and around ordinary chit-chat. It took\nlonger, naturally; when speaking without the chit-chat, it was\npossible to convey in seconds information that would have taken\nseveral minutes to get over in ordinary conversation.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSenator Kerotski only listened to a small part of the phone\ndiscussion. He knew most of the story.\n\nIn the past eight months, six anonymous letters had been received by\nvarious companies. As Taggert had once put it, in quotes, \"We seem to\nhave an Abudah chest containing a patent Hag who comes out and\nprophesies disasters, with spring complete.\"\n\nThe Big Bend Power Reactor, near Marfa, Texas, had been warned that\ntheir stellarator would blow. The letter was dismissed as \"crackpot,\"\nand no precautions were taken. The explosion killed nine men and cut\noff the power in the area for three hours, causing other accidents due\nto lack of power.\n\nThe merchant submarine _Bandar-log_, plying her way between Ceylon and\nJapan, had ignored the warning sent to her owners and had never been\nheard from again.\n\nIn the Republic of Yemen, an oil refinery caught fire and destroyed\nmillions of dollars worth of property in spite of the anonymous letter\nthat had foretold the disaster.\n\nThe Prince Charles Dam in Central Africa had broken and thousands had\ndrowned because those in charge had relegated a warning letter to the\ncylindrical file.\n\nA mine cave-in in Canada had extinguished three lives because a\nsimilar letter had been ignored.\n\nBy the time the fifth letter had been received, the S.M.M.R. had\nreceived the information and had begun its investigation. As an _ex\nofficio_ organ of the United States Government, it had ways and means\nof getting hold of the originals of the letters which had been\nreceived by the responsible persons in each of the disasters. All had\nbeen sent by the same man; all had been typed on the same machine; all\nhad been mailed in New York.\n\nWhen the sixth warning had come to the offices of Caribbean Trans-Air,\nthe S.M.M.R., working through the FBI, had persuaded the company's\nofficials to take the regularly scheduled aircraft off the run and\nsubstitute another while the regular ship was carefully inspected. But\nit was the replacement ship that came to pieces in midair.\n\nThe anonymous predictor, whoever he was, was a man of no mean ability.\n\nThen letter number seven had been received by the United States\nDepartment of Space. It predicted that a meteor would smash into\nAmerica's Moonbase One, completely destroying it.\n\nFinally, a non-anonymous letter had come to the S.M.M.R. requesting\nadmission to the society, enclosing the proper fee. The letter also\nsaid that the writer was interested in literature on the subjects of\nprescience, precognition, and/or prophecy, and would be interested in\ncontacting anyone who had had experience with such phenomena.\n\nPutting two and two together only yields four, no matter how often\nit's done, but two to the eighth power gives a nice, round two hundred\nfifty-six, which is something one can sink one's teeth into.\n\nBrian Taggert cut off the phone connection. \"That's it, Mike,\" he said\nto the senator. \"We've got him.\"\n\nTwo of the Society's agents, both top-flight telepaths, had gone out\nto \"Dr. Joachim's\" place on Coney Island's Boardwalk, posing as\ncustomers--\"clients\" was the word Dr. Joachim preferred--and had done\na thorough probing job.\n\n\"He's what might be called a perfectly sincere fraud,\" Taggert\ncontinued. \"You know the type I'm sure.\"\n\nThe senator nodded silently. The woods were full of that kind of\nthing. Complete, reliable control of any kind of psionic power\nrequires understanding and sanity, but the ability lies dormant in\nmany minds that cannot control it, and it can and does burst forth\nerratically at times. Finding a physical analogy for the phenomenon is\ndifficult, since mental activities are, of necessity, of a higher\norder than physical activities.\n\nSome of the operations of tensor calculus have analogs in algebra;\nmany do not.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTaggert gestured with one hand. \"He's been in business there for\nyears. Evidently, he's been able to make a few accurate predictions\nnow and then--enough to keep his reputation going. He's tried to\nincrease the frequency, accuracy, and detail of his 'flashes' by\nstudying up on the techniques used by other seers, and, as a result,\nhe's managed to soak up enough mystic balderdash to fill a library.\n\n\"He embellishes every one of his predictions to his 'clients' with all\nkinds of hokum, and he's been doing it so long that he really isn't\nsure how much of any prediction is truth and how much is embroidery\nwork.\n\n\"The boys are trying to get more information on him now, and they're\ngoing to do a little deep probing, if they can get him set up right;\nmaybe they'll be able to trigger off another flash on that\nmoon-hit--but I doubt it.\"\n\nSenator Kerotski thumbed his chin morosely. \"You're probably right.\nApparently, once those hunches come to a precog, they get everything\nin a flash and then they can't get another thing--ever. I wish we\ncould get our hands on one who was halfway along toward _the_ point.\nWe've got experts on psychokinetics, levitation, telepathy,\nclairvoyance, and what-have-you. But precognition we don't seem to be\nable to find.\"\n\n\"We've got one now,\" Brian Taggert reminded him.\n\nThe senator snorted. \"Even assuming that we had any theory on\nprecognition completely symbolized, and assuming that this Forsythe\nhas the kind of mind that can be taught, do you think we could get it\ndone in a month? Because that's all the time we have.\"\n\n\"He's our first case,\" Taggert admitted. \"We'll have to probe\neverything out of him and construct symbol-theory around what we get.\nI'll be surprised if we get anywhere at all in the first six months.\"\n\nSenator Kerotski put his hand over his eyes. \"I give up. First the\nChinese Soviet kidnaps Dr. Ch'ien and we have to scramble like maniacs\nto get him back before they find out that he's building a space drive\nthat will make the rocket industry obsolete. Then we have to find out\nwhat's causing the rash of accidents that is holding up Dr. Theodore\nNordred's antigravity project. And now, just as everything is coming\nto a head in both departments, we find that a meteor is going to hit\nMoonbase One sometime between thirty and sixty days from now.\" He\nspread apart the middle and ring fingers of the hand that covered his\neyes and looked at Taggert through one eye. \"And now you tell me that\nthe only man who can pinpoint that time more exactly for us is of no\nuse whatever to us. If we knew when that meteor was due to arrive, we\nwould be able to spot and deflect it in time. It must be of pretty\ngood size if it's going to demolish the whole base.\"\n\n\"How do you know it's going to be a meteor?\"\n\n\"You think the Soviets would try to bomb it? Don't be silly, Taggert,\"\nKerotski said, grinning.\n\nTaggert grinned back. \"I'm not thinking they'd bomb us; but I'm trying\nto look at all the angles.\"\n\nThe worried look came back to the senator's pandalike face. \"We have\nto do something. If only we _knew_ that Forsythe's prediction will\nreally come off. Or, if it will, then exactly _when_? And is there\nanything we can do about it, or will it be like the airline incident.\nIf we hadn't made them switch planes, nothing would have happened.\nWhat if, no matter what we do, Moonbase One goes anyway?\n\n\"Remember, we haven't yet built Moonbase Two. If our only base on the\nmoon is destroyed, the Soviets will have the whole moon to themselves.\nHave you any suggestions?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Taggert. \"Ask yourself one question: What is the purpose\nof Moonbase One?\"\n\nSlowly, a beatific smile spread itself over the senator's face.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe whole discussion had taken exactly ninety seconds.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Mrs. Jesser,\" said Brian Taggert to the well-rounded, fortyish woman\nbehind the reception desk at S.M.M.R. headquarters, \"this is Dr.\nForsythe. He has established a reputation as one of the finest seers\nliving today.\"\n\nMrs. Jesser looked at the distinguished, white-bearded gentleman with\nan expression that was almost identical with the one her grandmother\nhad worn when she met Rudolph Valentino, nearly sixty years before,\nand the one her mother had worn when she saw Frank Sinatra a\ngeneration later. It was not an uncommon expression for Mrs. Jesser's\nface to wear: it appeared every time she was introduced to anyone who\nlooked impressive and was touted as a great mystic of one kind or\nanother.\n\n\"I'm _so_ glad to _meet_ you, Dr. Forsythe!\" she burbled eagerly.\n\n\"Dr. Forsythe will be working for us for the next few months--his\noffice will be Room B on the fourth floor,\" Taggert finished. He was\ngenuinely fond of the woman, in spite of her mental dithers and\nschoolgirl mannerisms. Mysticism fascinated her, and she was firmly\nconvinced that she had \"just a _weenie_ bit\" of psychic power herself,\nalthough its exact nature seemed to change from time to time. But she\ndid both her jobs well, although she was not aware of her double\nfunction. She thought she was being paid as a receptionist and phone\noperator, and she was quick and efficient about her work. She was also\nthe perfect screen for the Society's real work, for if anyone ever\nsuspected that the S.M.M.R. was not the group of crackpots that it\nappeared to be, five minutes talking with Mrs. Jesser would convince\nthem otherwise.\n\n\"Oh, you're _staying_ with us, Dr. Forsythe? How wonderful! We simply\n_must_ have a talk sometime!\"\n\n\"Indeed we must, dear lady,\" said Forsythe. His voice and manner had\njust the right amount of benign dignity, with an almost indetectable\ntouch of pompous condescending.\n\n\"Come along, doctor; I'll show you to your office.\" Taggert's face\nbetrayed nothing of the enjoyment he was getting out of watching the\nmental gymnastics of the two. Forsythe and Mrs. Jesser were similar in\nsome ways, but, of the two, Mrs. Jesser was actually the more honest.\nShe only fooled herself; she never tried to fool anyone else.\nForsythe, on the other hand, tried to put on a front for others, and,\nin doing so, had managed to delude himself pretty thoroughly.\n\nTaggert's humor was not malicious; he was not laughing at them. He was\nadmiring the skill of the human mind in tying itself in knots. When\none watches a clever contortionist going through his paces, one\ndoesn't laugh at the contortionist; one admires and enjoys the weird\ntwists he can get himself into. And, like Taggert, one can only feel\nsympathy for one whose knots have become so devious and intricate that\nhe can never extricate himself.\n\n\"Just follow me up the stairs,\" Taggert said. \"I'll show you where\nyour office is. Sorry we don't have an elevator, but this old building\njust wasn't built for it, and we've never had any real need for one.\"\n\n\"Perfectly all right,\" Forsythe said, following along behind.\n\n_Three weeks!_\n\nTaggert had to assume that the minimum time prediction was the\naccurate one. Damn! Why couldn't this last prediction have been as\nprecise as the one about the air flight from Puerto Rico?\n\nIt had taken six days for the \"accredited\" agents of the S.M.M.R. to\npersuade Dr. Peter Forsythe that he should leave his little place on\nthe Boardwalk and come down to Arlington to work. It isn't easy to\npersuade a man to leave a business that he's built up over a long\nperiod of years, especially during the busy season. To leave the\nBoardwalk during the summer would, as far as Forsythe was concerned,\nbe tantamount to economic suicide. He had to be offered not only an\nincome better than the one he was making, but better security as well.\nAt fifty-four, one does not lightly throw over the work of a lifetime.\n\nStill, he had plenty of safeguards. The rent was paid on his Boardwalk\noffice, he had a guaranteed salary while he was working, and a\n\"research bonus,\" designed to keep him working until the Society was\nfinished with that phase of its work.\n\nIt's rather difficult for a man to resist the salesmanship of a\ntelepath who knows exactly what his customer wants and, better, what\nhe needs.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the fourth floor, there were sounds of movement, the low staccato\nchatter of typers, occasional bits of conversation, and the hum of\nelectronic equipment.\n\nForsythe was impressed, though not a line on his face showed it. The\noffice to which he had been assigned was lined with electronic\ncalculators, and his name had already been put on the door in gold. It\nwas to his credit that he was impressed by the two factors in that\norder.\n\nIn the rear of the room, two technicians were working on an open panel\nin one of the units. Nearby, a dark-haired, dark-eyed, maturely\nhandsome woman in her early thirties was holding a clip board and\nmaking occasional notes as the men worked. One of the men was using an\nelectric drill, and the whine of metal on metal drowned out the slight\nnoise that Taggert and Forsythe made as they entered. Only the woman\nwas aware that they had come in, but she didn't betray the fact.\n\n\"Miss Tedesco?\" Taggert called.\n\nShe looked up from her clip board, smiled, and walked toward the two\nnewcomers. \"Yes, Mr. Taggert?\"\n\n\"'Bout done?\"\n\n\"Almost. They're setting in the last component now.\"\n\nTaggert nodded absently. \"Miss Tedesco, this is Dr. Peter Forsythe,\nwhom I told you about. Dr. Forsythe, this is Miss Donna Tedesco; she's\nthe computer technician who will be working with you.\"\n\nMiss Tedesco's smile was positively glittering. \"I'm so pleased to\nmeet you, doctor; I know our work together will be interesting.\"\n\n\"I trust it will,\" Forsythe said, beaming. Then a faint cloud seemed to\ncome over his features. \"I'm afraid I must confess a certain ... er ...\nlack of knowledge in the realm of computerdom. Mr. Taggert attempted to\nexplain, but he, himself, has admitted that his knowledge of the details\nis ... er ... somewhat vague.\"\n\n\"I'm not a computerman, myself,\" Taggert said, smiling. \"Miss Tedesco\nwill be able to give you the details better than I can.\"\n\nMiss Tedesco blinked. \"You know the broad outline, surely? Of the\nproject, I mean.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, certainly,\" Forsythe said hurriedly. \"We are attempting to\ndetermine whether the actions of human beings can actually have any\neffect on the outcome of the prophecy itself. In other words, if it is\npossible to avert, say, a disaster if it is foretold, or whether the\nvery foretelling itself assures the ultimate outcome.\"\n\nThe woman nodded her agreement.\n\n\"As I understand it,\" Forsythe continued, \"we are going to get several\nscore clients--or, rather, _subjects_--and I am to ... uh ... exercise\nmy talents, just as I have been doing for many years. The results are\nto be tabulated and run through the computers to see if there is any\ncorrelation between human activity taken as a result of the forecast\nand the actual foretold events themselves.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" said Miss Tedesco. She looked at Taggert. \"That's what\nthe committee outlined, in general, isn't it?\"\n\n\"In general, yes,\" Taggert said.\n\n\"But what about the details?\" Forsythe asked doggedly. \"I mean, just\nhow are we going to go about this? You must remember that I'm not at\nall familiar with ... er ... scientific research procedures.\"\n\n\"Oh, we'll work all that out together,\" said Miss Tedesco brightly.\n\"You didn't think we'd plan a detailed work schedule without your\nco-operation, did you?\"\n\n\"Well--\" Forsythe said, swelling visibly with pride, \"I suppose--\"\n\nTaggert, glancing at his watch, interrupted. \"I'll have to leave you\ntwo to work out your research schedule together. I have an appointment\nin a few minutes.\" He grasped Forsythe's hand and pumped it\nvigorously. \"I believe we'll get along fine, Dr. Forsythe. And I\nbelieve our work here will be quite fruitful. Will you excuse me?\"\n\n\"Certainly, Mr. Taggert. And I want to thank you for this opportunity\nto do research work along these lines.\"\n\nBrian Taggert thanked Forsythe and hurried out with the air of a man\nwith important and urgent things on his mind.\n\nHe went up the stairs to the office directly over the one he had\nassigned to Forsythe and stepped in quietly. Two men were relaxed in\nlounge chairs, their eyes closed.\n\n_Meshing?_ Taggert asked wordlessly.\n\n_Meshing._\n\nTaggert closed the door carefully and went into his own office.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGeneral Howard Layton, USSF, looked no different from any other Space\nForce officer, except that he was rather handsomer than most. He\nlooked as though he might have posed for recruiting posters at one\ntime, and, in point of fact, he had--back when he had been an ensign\nin the United States Navy's Submarine Service. He was forty-nine and\nlooked a prematurely graying thirty.\n\nHe stood in the observation bunker at the landing area of St. Thomas\nSpacefield and watched through the periscope as a heavy rocket settled\nitself to the surface of the landing area. The blue-white tongue of\nflame touched the surface and splattered; then the heavy ship settled\nslowly down over it, as though it were sliding down a column of light.\nThe column of light shortened--\n\nAnd abruptly vanished as the ship touched down.\n\nGeneral Layton took his eyes away from the periscope. \"Another one\nback safely. Thank God.\"\n\nNearby, the only other man in that room of the bunker, a rather short\ncivilian, had been watching the same scene on a closed-circuit TV\nscreen. He smiled up at the general. \"How many loads does that make,\nso far?\"\n\n\"Five. We'll have the job done before the deadline time.\"\n\n\"Were you worried?\"\n\n\"A little. I still am, to be honest. What if nothing happens at the\nend of sixty days? The President isn't one of us, and he's only gone\nalong with the Society's recommendations so far because we've been\nable to produce results. But\"--he gestured outside, indicating the\nnewly-landed ship--\"all this extra expense isn't going to set well\nwith him if we goof this once.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said the civilian. \"But have you ever known Brian Taggert to\nbe wrong?\"\n\nGeneral Layton grinned. \"No. And in a lesser man, that sort of\nomniscience could be infernally irritating. How is he progressing with\nForsythe?\"\n\nThe civilian frowned. \"We've got plenty of data so far, and the method\nseems to be working well, but we don't have enough to theorize yet.\n\n\"Forsythe just sits in his office and gives 'readings,' or whatever\nyou want to call them, to the subjects who come in. _The\nMetaphysicist_ has been running an ad asking for volunteers, so we\nhave all kinds of people calling up for appointments. Forsythe is as\nhappy as a kid.\"\n\n\"How about his predictions?\"\n\n\"Donna Tedesco is running data processing on them. She's in constant\nmental contact with him. So are Hughes and Matson, in the office\nabove. The three of them are meshed together with each other--don't\nask me how; I'm no telepath--and they're getting a pretty good idea of\nwhat's going on in Forsythe's mind.\n\n\"Every once in a while, he gets a real flash of something, and it\napparently comes pretty fast. The team is trying to analyze the\nfine-grain structure of the process now.\n\n\"The rest of the time, he simply gives out with the old guff that\nphony crystal-ball gazers have been giving out for centuries. Even\nwhen he gets a real flash, he piles on a lot of intuitive\nextrapolation. And the farther he gets from that central flash, the\nless reliable the predictions are.\"\n\n\"Do you think we'll get theory and symbology worked out before that\nmeteor is supposed to hit Moonbase One?\" asked the general.\n\nThe civilian shrugged. \"Who knows? We'll have to take a lot on faith\nif we do, because there won't be enough time to check all his\npredictions. Each subject is being given a report sheet with his\nforecast on it, and he's supposed to check the accuracy of it as it\nhappens. And our agents are making spot checks on them just to make\nsure. It'll take time. All we can do is hope.\"\n\n\"I suppose.\" General Layton took a quick look through the periscope\nagain. The ship's air lock still hadn't opened; the air and ground\nwere still too hot. He looked back at the civilian. \"What about the\nespionage reports?\"\n\nThe civilian tapped his briefcase. \"I can give it to you in a capsule,\nverbally. You can look these over later.\"\n\n\"Shoot.\"\n\n\"The Soviets are getting worried, to put it bluntly. We can't hide\nthose rockets, you know. Their own Luna-based radar has been picking\nup every one of them as they come in and leave. They're wondering why\nwe're making so many trips all of a sudden.\"\n\n\"Have they done any theorizing?\" the general asked worriedly.\n\n\"They have.\" The civilian chuckled sardonically. \"They've decided\nwe're trying for another Mars shot--a big one, this time.\"\n\nThe general exhaled sharply. \"That's too close for comfort. How do\nthey figure?\"\n\n\"They figure we're amassing material at Moonbase One. They figure we\nintend to build the ship there, with the loads of stuff that we're\nsending up in the rockets.\"\n\n\"_What?_\" General Layton opened his mouth, then closed it. Then he\nbegan to laugh.\n\nThe civilian joined him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDonna Tedesco pushed the papers across Brian Taggert's desk. \"Check\nthem yourself, Brian. I've gone over them six ways from Septuagesima,\nand I still can't see any other answer.\"\n\nTaggert frowned at the papers and tapped them with a thoughtful\nfinger, but he didn't pick them up. \"I'll take your word for it,\nDonna. At least for right now. If we get completely balled up, we'll\ngo over them together.\"\n\n\"If you ask me, we've already completely balled up.\"\n\n\"You think it's that bad?\"\n\nShe looked at him pleadingly. \"Can you think of any other\nexplanation?\"\n\n\"Not just yet,\" Brian Taggert admitted.\n\n\"Nor can I. There it is. Every single one of his valid predictions,\nevery single one of his precognitive intuitions--_without\nexception_--has been based on the actions of human beings. He can\npredict stock market fluctuations, and family squabbles, and South\nAmerican election results. His disaster predictions, every one of\nthem, were due to _human_ error, _human_ failure--not Acts of God. He\nfailed to predict the earthquake in Los Angeles; he missed the flood\nin the Yangtze Valley; he knew nothing of the eruption of Stromboli.\nAll of these were disasters that took human lives in the past three\nweeks, and he missed every one of them. And yet, he managed to get\nnearly every major ship, airplane, and even automobile accident\nconnected with his subjects.\n\n\"Seven of his subjects had relatives or friends who were hurt or\nkilled in the earthquake-flood-eruption sequence, but he didn't see\nthem. Yet he could pick up such small things as a nephew of one of the\nmen getting a bad scald on his arm.\n\n\"In the face of that, how can we rely on his one prediction about a\nmeteor striking Moonbase One?\"\n\nTaggert rubbed his forehead thoughtfully. \"I don't know,\" he said\nslowly. \"There must be a connection somehow.\"\n\n\"Oh, Brian, Brian!\" Her eyes were glistening with as yet unshed tears.\n\"I've never seen you go off on a wild tangent like this before! On the\nword of an old fraud like Forsythe, a man who lies about half the\ntime, you talk the Administration into sinking hundreds of millions of\ndollars into the biggest space lift in history!\n\n\"Oh, sure; I know. The old fraud is convinced he was telling the\ntruth. But were you tapping his mind when the prediction flash came?\nNo! Was anyone? No! And he's perfectly capable of lying to himself,\nand you know it!\n\n\"And what will happen if it doesn't come off? We're past the first\ndeadline already. If that meteor doesn't hit within the next\ntwenty-eight days, the Society will be right back where it was ten\nyears ago! Or worse!\n\n\"And all because you trusted the word of Mr. Phony-Doctor Forsythe!\"\n\n\"Donna,\" Taggert said softly, \"do you really think I'm that big a\nfool?\" He handed her a handkerchief.\n\n\"N-no,\" she answered, wiping at her eyes. \"Of c-course I don't. It's\njust that it makes me so d-darn _mad_ to see everything go wrong like\nthis.\"\n\n\"Nothing's gone wrong yet. I suggest you go take a good look at\nForsythe's mind again and really try to understand the old boy. Maybe\nyou'll get more of the fine-grain structure of it if you'll try for\nmore understanding.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" she asked, sniffing.\n\n\"Look. Forsythe has made his living being a fraud, right? And yet he\nsent out those warning _free_--and anonymously. He had no thought of\nany reward or recompense, you know that. Why? Because he is basically\na kind, decent human being. He wanted to do all he could to stop any\ninjury or loss of life.\n\n\"Why, then, would he send out a fraudulent warning? He wouldn't. He\ndidn't. Every one of those warnings--_including the last one_--was\nsent out because he _knew_ that something was going to happen.\n\n\"Evidently, once he gets a flash about a certain event, he can't get\nany more data on that particular area of the future, or we could get\nmore data on the Moonbase accident. I think, if we can boost his basic\nunderstanding up past the critical point, we'll have a man with\ncontrolled prescience, and we need that man.\n\n\"But, Donna, the only way we're ever going to do that--the only way\nwe'll ever whip this problem--is for you to increase _your_\nunderstanding of _him_.\n\n\"You're past the critical point--way past it--in _general_\nunderstanding. But you've got to keep an eye on the little specific\ninstances, too.\"\n\nShe nodded contritely. \"I know. I'm sorry. Sometimes a person can get\ntoo near a problem.\" She smiled. \"Thanks for the new perspective,\nBrian. I'll go back to work and see if I can't look at it a little\nmore clearly.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the White House, Senator Mikhail Kerotski was facing two men--James\nBandeau, the Secretary of Space, and the President of the United\nStates.\n\n\"Mr. President,\" he said evenly, \"I've known you for a long time. I\nhaven't failed you yet.\"\n\n\"I know that, Mike,\" the President said smoothly. \"Neither has your\nSociety, as far as I know. It's still difficult for me to believe that\nthey get their information the way you say they do, but you've never\nlied to me about anything so far, so I take your word for it. Your\nSociety is the most efficient espionage and counterespionage group in\nhistory, as far as I know. But this is different.\"\n\n\"Damned right it's different!\" snapped Secretary Bandeau. \"Your own\nSociety, senator, admits that we've stirred the Soviets up with this\nspace lift thing. They've got ships of their own going out there now.\nAccording to reports from Space Force intelligence, Chinese Moon cars\nhave been prowling around Moonbase One, trying to find out what's\ngoing on.\"\n\n\"More than that,\" added the President, \"they've sneaked a small group\naboard the old _Lunik IX_ to see what they can see from up there.\"\n\nSecretary Bandeau jerked his head around to look at the President.\n\"The old circumlunar satellite? Where did you hear that?\"\n\nThe President smiled wanly. \"From the S.M.M.R.'s report.\" He looked at\nKerotski. \"I doubt that it will do them any good. I don't think\nthey'll be able to see anything now.\"\n\n\"Not unless they've figured out some way to combine X rays with\nradar,\" the senator said. \"And I'm quite sure they haven't.\"\n\n\"Senator,\" said the Secretary of Space, \"a lot of money has been spent\nand a lot of risks have been taken, just on your say-so. I--\"\n\n\"Now, just a minute, Jim,\" said the President flatly. \"Let's not go\noff half-cocked. It wasn't done on Mike's say-so; it was done on mine.\nI signed the order because I believed it was the proper, if not the\n_only_ thing to do.\" Then he looked at the senator. \"But this is the\nlast day, Mike. Nothing has happened.\n\n\"Now, I'm not blaming you. I didn't call you up here to do that. And I\nthink we can quit worrying about explaining away the money angle. But\nwe're going to have to explain _why_ we did it, Mike. And I can't tell\nthe truth.\"\n\n\"I'll say you can't!\" Bandeau exploded. \"That would look great,\nwouldn't it? I can see the headlines now: _'Fortuneteller Gave Me\nAdvice,' President Says_. Brother!\"\n\n\"Jim,\" the President said coldly, \"I said to let me handle this.\"\n\n\"What you want, then, Mr. President,\" Kerotski put in smoothly, \"is\nfor me to help you concoct a good cover story.\"\n\n\"That's about it, Mike,\" the President admitted.\n\nKerotski shook his head slowly. \"It won't be necessary.\"\n\nBandeau looked as though he were going to explode, but a glance from\nthe President silenced him.\n\n\"Go on, Mike,\" he said to the senator.\n\n\"Mr. President, I know it looks bad. It's going to look even worse for\na while. But, let me ask you one question. How is the Ch'ien space\ndrive coming along?\"\n\n\"Why ... fine. It checked out months ago. The new ship is on her\nshakedown cruise now. You know that.\"\n\n\"Right. Now, ask yourself one more question: What is the purpose of\nMoonbase One?\"\n\n\"Why, to--\"\n\nThe telephone rang.\n\nThe President scooped it up with one hand. \"Yes?\"\n\nThen he listened for a long minute, his expression changing slowly.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said at last. \"Yes, I got it. No; I'll release it to the\nnewsmen. All right. Fine.\" He hung up.\n\n\"Twelve minutes ago,\" he said slowly, \"the old _Lunik IX_ smashed\ninto Moonbase One and blew it to smithereens. The Soviets say that a\nmeteor hit _Lunik IX_ at just the right angle to slow it down enough\nto make it hit the base. They send their condolences.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBrian Taggert lay back on the couch in his office and folded his hands\ncomplacently on his abdomen. \"So Donna's theory held water and so did\nmine. The accident was due to human intervention. Forsythe saw\nsomething from space hitting Moonbase One and assumed it was a meteor.\nHe never dreamed the Soviets would drop old _Lunik IX_ on it.\"\n\nSenator Kerotski carefully lit a cigar. \"There's going to be an awful\nlot of fuss in the papers, but the President is going to announce that\nhe accepts the Soviet story. I convinced him that it is best to let\nthe Soviets think they're a long way ahead of us in the space race\nnow. There's nothing like a little complacency to slow someone down.\"\n\n\"How'd you convince him?\"\n\n\"Asked the same question you asked me. Now that we have the Ch'ien\nspace drive, what purpose does a moon base serve? None at all, of\ncourse.\"\n\nDonna Tadesco leaned forward in her chair. \"Did you happen to notice\nthe sequence of events, senator? We were warned that the base would be\nstruck. We decided to abandon it. We organized the biggest space lift\nin history to evacuate the men and the most valuable instruments. But\nthe Soviets thought we were sending equipment _up_ instead of bringing\nit _down_. They didn't know what we were up to, but they decided to\nput a stop to it, so they dropped an abandoned space satellite on it.\n\n\"If we hadn't decided to evacuate the base, it would never have\nhappened.\n\n\"_That_ is human intervention with a vengeance. We still don't know\nwhether or not Forsythe's predictions will ever do us any good or not.\nEvery time we've taken steps to avoid one of his prophesied\ncatastrophes, we've done the very thing that brought them about.\"\n\nThe senator puffed his cigar in thoughtful silence.\n\n\"We'll just have to keep working with him,\" Taggert said. \"Maybe we'll\neventually make sense out of this precognition thing.\n\n\"At least we've got what we wanted. The Soviets think they've put us\nback ten years; they figure they've got more time, now, to get their\nown program a long ways ahead.\n\n\"When they do get to Mars and Venus and the planets of Alpha Centauri\nand Sirius and Procyon, they'll find us there, waiting for them.\"\n\nSenator Kerotski chuckled softly. \"You're a pretty good prophet,\nyourself, Brian. The only difference between you and Forsythe is that\nhe's right half the time.\n\n\"You're right _all_ the time.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Taggert. \"Not all the time. Only when it's important.\"\n\n\nTHE END\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Fifty Per Cent Prophet, by Gordon Randall Garrett\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK FIFTY PER CENT PROPHET ***\n\n***** This file should be named 30337-8.txt or 30337-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/0/3/3/30337/\n\nProduced by Sankar Viswanathan, Greg Weeks, and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
