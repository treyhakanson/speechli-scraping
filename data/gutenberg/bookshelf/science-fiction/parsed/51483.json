ROBINSON\n\n                       Illustrated by DON SIBLEY\n\n           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n                 Galaxy Science Fiction January 1951.\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\n\n\n\n         Pioneers have always resented their wanderlust, hated\n       their hardships. But the future brings a new grudge--when\n           pioneers stay put and scholars do the exploring!\n\n\n_The very young man sat on the edge of the sofa and looked nervous. He\ncarefully studied his fingernails and ran his hands through his hair\nand picked imaginary lint off the upholstery._\n\n_\"I have a chance to go with the first research expedition to Venus,\"\nhe said._\n\n_The older man studied the very young man thoughtfully and then leaned\nover to his humidor and offered him a cigaret. \"It's nice to have the\nnew air units now. There was a time when we had to be very careful\nabout things like smoking.\"_\n\n_The very young man was annoyed._\n\n_\"I don't think I want to go,\" he blurted. \"I don't think I would care\nto spend two years there.\"_\n\n_The older man blew a smoke ring and watched it drift toward the air\nexhaust vent._\n\n_\"You mean you would miss it here, the people you've known and grown\nup with, the little familiar things that have made up your life here.\nYou're afraid the glamor would wear off and you would get to hate it on\nVenus.\"_\n\n_The very young man nodded miserably. \"I guess that's it.\"_\n\n_\"Anything else?\"_\n\n_The very young man found his fingernails extremely fascinating again\nand finally said, in a low voice, \"Yes, there is.\"_\n\n_\"A girl?\"_\n\n_A nod confirmed this._\n\n_It was the older man's turn to look thoughtful. \"You know, I'm sure,\nthat psychologists and research men agree that research stations should\nbe staffed by couples. That is, of course, as soon as it's practical.\"_\n\n_\"But that might be a long time!\" the very young man protested._\n\n_\"It might be--but sometimes it's sooner than you think. And the goal\nis worth it.\"_\n\n_\"I suppose so, but--\"_\n\n_The older man smiled. \"Still the reluctant heroes,\" he said, somewhat\nto himself._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nChapman stared at the radio key.\n\nThree years on the Moon and they didn't want him to come back.\n\nThree years on the Moon and they thought he'd be glad to stay for more.\nJust raise his salary or give him a bonus, the every-man-has-his-price\nidea. They probably thought he liked it there.\n\nOh, sure, he loved it. Canned coffee, canned beans, canned pills,\nand canned air until your insides felt as though they were plated\nwith tin. Life in a cramped, smelly little hut where you could take\nonly ten steps in any one direction. Their little scientific home of\ntomorrow with none of the modern conveniences, a charming place where\nyou couldn't take a shower, couldn't brush your teeth, and your kidneys\ndidn't work right.\n\nAnd for double his salary they thought he'd be glad to stay for another\nyear and a half. Or maybe three. He should probably be glad he had the\nopportunity.\n\nThe key started to stutter again, demanding an answer.\n\nHe tapped out his reply: \"_No!_\"\n\nThere was a silence and then the key stammered once more in a sudden\nfit of bureaucratic rage. Chapman stuffed a rag under it and ignored\nit. He turned to the hammocks, strung against the bulkhead on the other\nside of the room.\n\nThe chattering of the key hadn't awakened anybody; they were still\nasleep, making the animal noises that people usually make in slumber.\nDowden, half in the bottom hammock and half on the floor, was snoring\npeacefully. Dahl, the poor kid who was due for stopover, was mumbling\nto himself. Julius Klein, with that look of ineffable happiness on his\nface, looked as if he had just squirmed under the tent to his personal\nidea of heaven. Donley and Bening were lying perfectly still, their\ncovers not mussed, sleeping very lightly.\n\nLord, Chapman thought, I'll be happy when I can see some other faces.\n\n\"What'd they want?\" Klein had one eyelid open and a questioning look on\nhis face.\n\n\"They wanted me to stay until the next relief ship lands,\" Chapman\nwhispered back.\n\n\"What did you say?\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"No.\"\n\n\"You kept it short,\" somebody else whispered. It was Donley, up and\nsitting on the side of his hammock. \"If it had been me, I would have\ntold them just what they could do about it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe others were awake now, with the exception of Dahl who had his face\nto the bulkhead and a pillow over his head.\n\nDowden rubbed his eyes sleepily. \"Sore, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Kind of. Who wouldn't be?\"\n\n\"Well, don't let it throw you. They've never been here on the Moon.\nThey don't know what it's like. All they're trying to do is get a good\nman to stay on the job a while longer.\"\n\n\"_All_ they're trying to do,\" Chapman said sarcastically. \"They've got\na fat chance.\"\n\n\"They think you've found a home here,\" Donley said.\n\n\"Why the hell don't you guys shut up until morning?\" Dahl was awake,\nlooking bitter. \"Some of us still have to stay here, you know. Some of\nus aren't going back today.\"\n\nNo, Chapman thought, some of us aren't going back. You aren't. And\nDixon's staying, too. Only Dixon isn't ever going back.\n\nKlein jerked his thumb toward Dahl's bunk, held a finger to his lips,\nand walked noiselessly over to the small electric stove. It was his day\nfor breakfast duty.\n\nThe others started lacing up their bunks, getting ready for their last\nday of work on the Moon. In a few hours they'd be relieved by members\nof the Third research group and they'd be on their way back to Earth.\n\nAnd that includes me, Chapman thought. I'm going home. I'm finally\ngoing home.\n\nHe walked silently to the one small, quartz window in the room. It was\nmorning--the Moon's \"morning\"--and he shivered slightly. The rays of\nthe Sun were just striking the far rim of the crater and long shadows\nshot across the crater floor. The rest of it was still blanketed in\na dark jumble of powdery pumice and jagged peaks that would make the\nBlack Hills of Dakota look like paradise.\n\nA hundred yards from the research bunker he could make out the small\nmound of stones and the forlorn homemade cross, jury-rigged out of\nsmall condensed milk tins slid over crossed iron bars. You could still\nsee the footprints in the powdery soil where the group had gathered\nabout the grave. It had been more than eighteen months ago, but there\nwas no wind to wear those tracks away. They'd be there forever.\n\nThat's what happened to guys like Dixon, Chapman thought. On the Moon,\none mistake could use up your whole quota of chances.\n\nKlein came back with the coffee. Chapman took a cup, gagged, and forced\nhimself to swallow the rest of it. It had been in the can for so long\nyou could almost taste the glue on the label.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDonley was warming himself over his cup, looking thoughtful. Dowden and\nBening were struggling into their suits, getting ready to go outside.\nDahl was still sitting on his hammock, trying to ignore them.\n\n\"Think we ought to radio the space station and see if they've left\nthere yet?\" Klein asked.\n\n\"I talked to them on the last call,\" Chapman said. \"The relief ship\nleft there twelve hours ago. They should get here\"--he looked at his\nwatch--\"in about six and a half hours.\"\n\n\"Chap, you know, I've been thinking,\" Donley said quietly. \"You've\nbeen here just twice as long as the rest of us. What's the first thing\nyou're going to do once you get back?\"\n\nIt hit them, then. Dowden and Bening looked blank for a minute and\nblindly found packing cases to sit on. The top halves of their suits\nwere still hanging on the bulkhead. Klein lowered his coffee cup and\nlooked grave. Even Dahl glanced up expectantly.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Chapman said slowly. \"I guess I was trying not to think\nof that. I suppose none of us have. We've been like little kids who\nhave waited so long for Christmas that they just can't believe it when\nit's finally Christmas Eve.\"\n\nKlein nodded in agreement. \"I haven't been here three years like you\nhave, but I think I know what you mean.\" He warmed up to it as the idea\nsank in. \"Just what the hell _are_ you going to do?\"\n\n\"Nothing very spectacular,\" Chapman said, smiling. \"I'm going to rent\na room over Times Square, get a recording of a rikky-tik piano, and\ndrink and listen to the music and watch the people on the street below.\nThen I think I'll see somebody.\"\n\n\"Who's the somebody?\" Donley asked.\n\nChapman grinned. \"Oh, just somebody. What are you going to do, Dick?\"\n\n\"Well, I'm going to do something practical. First of all, I want to\nturn over all my geological samples to the government. Then I'm going\nto sell my life story to the movies and then--why, then, I think I'll\nget drunk!\"\n\nEverybody laughed and Chapman turned to Klein.\n\n\"How about you, Julius?\"\n\nKlein looked solemn. \"Like Dick, I'll first get rid of my obligations\nto the expedition. Then I think I'll go home and see my wife.\"\n\nThey were quiet. \"I thought all members of the groups were supposed to\nbe single,\" Donley said.\n\n\"They are. And I can see their reasons for it. But who could pass up\nthe money the Commission was paying?\"\n\n\"If I had to do it all over again? Me,\" said Donley promptly.\n\nThey laughed. Somebody said: \"Go play your record, Chap. Today's the\nday for it.\"\n\nThe phonograph was a small, wind-up model that Chapman had smuggled in\nwhen he had landed with the First group. The record was old and the\nshellac was nearly worn off, but the music was good.\n\n     Way Back Home by Al Lewis.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey ran through it twice. They were beginning to feel it now, Chapman\nthought. They were going to go home in a little while and the idea was\njust starting to sink in.\n\n\"You know, Chap,\" Donley said, \"it won't seem like the same old Moon\nwithout you on it. Why, we'll look at it when we're out spooning or\nsomething and it just won't have the same old appeal.\"\n\n\"Like they say in the army,\" Bening said, \"you never had it so good.\nYou found a home here.\"\n\nThe others chimed in and Chapman grinned. Yesterday or a week ago they\ncouldn't have done it. He had been there too long and he had hated it\ntoo much.\n\nThe party quieted down after a while and Dowden and Bening finished\ngetting into their suits. They still had a section of the sky to map\nbefore they left. Donley was right after them. There was an outcropping\nof rock that he wanted a sample of and some strata he wished to\ninvestigate.\n\nAnd the time went faster when you kept busy.\n\nChapman stopped them at the lock. \"Remember to check your suits for\nleaks,\" he warned. \"And check the valves of your oxygen tanks.\"\n\nDonley looked sour. \"I've gone out at least five hundred times,\" he\nsaid, \"and you check me each time.\"\n\n\"And I'd check you five hundred more,\" Chapman said. \"It takes only\none mistake. And watch out for blisters under the pumice crust. You go\nthrough one of those and that's it, brother.\"\n\nDonley sighed. \"Chap, you watch us like an old mother hen. You see we\ncheck our suits, you settle our arguments, you see that we're not bored\nand that we stay healthy and happy. I think you'd blow our noses for us\nif we caught cold. But some day, Chap old man, you're gonna find out\nthat your little boys can watch out for themselves!\"\n\nBut he checked his suit for leaks and tested the valve of his tank\nbefore he left.\n\nOnly Klein and Chapman were left in the bunker. Klein was at the work\ntable, carefully labeling some lichen specimens.\n\n\"I never knew you were married,\" Chapman said.\n\nKlein didn't look up. \"There wasn't much sense in talking about it. You\njust get to thinking and wanting--and there's nothing you can do about\nit. You talk about it and it just makes it worse.\"\n\n\"She let you go without any fuss, huh?\"\n\n\"No, she didn't make any fuss. But I don't think she liked to see me\ngo, either.\" He laughed a little. \"At least I hope she didn't.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were silent for a while. \"What do you miss most, Chap?\" Klein\nasked. \"Oh, I know what we said a little while ago, but I mean\nseriously.\"\n\nChapman thought a minute. \"I think I miss the sky,\" he said quietly.\n\"The blue sky and the green grass and trees with leaves on them that\nturn color in the Fall. I think, when I go back, that I'd like to go\nout in a rain storm and strip and feel the rain on my skin.\"\n\nHe stopped, feeling embarrassed. Klein's expression was encouraging.\n\"And then I think I'd like to go downtown and just watch the shoppers\non the sidewalks. Or maybe go to a burlesque house and smell the cheap\nperfume and the popcorn and the people sweating in the dark.\"\n\nHe studied his hands. \"I think what I miss most is people--all kinds\nof people. Bad people and good people and fat people and thin people,\nand people I can't understand. People who wouldn't know an atom from an\nartichoke. And people who wouldn't give a damn. We're a quarter of a\nmillion miles from nowhere, Julius, and to make it literary, I think I\nmiss my fellow man more than anything.\"\n\n\"Got a girl back home?\" Klein asked almost casually.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You're not like Dahl. You've never mentioned it.\"\n\n\"Same reason you didn't mention your wife. You get to thinking about\nit.\"\n\nKlein flipped the lid on the specimen box. \"Going to get married when\nyou get back?\"\n\nChapman was at the port again, staring out at the bleak landscape. \"We\nhope to.\"\n\n\"Settle down in a small cottage and raise lots of little Chapmans, eh?\"\n\nChapman nodded.\n\n\"That's the only future,\" Klein said.\n\nHe put away the box and came over to the port. Chapman moved over so\nthey both could look out.\n\n\"Chap.\" Klein hesitated a moment. \"What happened to Dixon?\"\n\n\"He died,\" Chapman said. \"He was a good kid, all wrapped up in science.\nBeing on the Moon was the opportunity of a lifetime. He thought so much\nabout it that he forgot a lot of little things--like how to stay alive.\nThe day before the Second group came, he went out to finish some work\nhe was interested in. He forgot to check for leaks and whether or not\nthe valve on his tank was all the way closed. We couldn't get to him in\ntime.\"\n\n\"He had his walkie-talkie with him?\"\n\n\"Yes. It worked fine, too. We heard everything that went through his\nmind at the end.\"\n\nKlein's face was blank. \"What's your real job here, Chap? Why does\nsomebody have to stay for stopover?\"\n\n\"Hell, lots of reasons, Julius. You can't get a whole relief crew and\nlet them take over cold. They have to know where you left off. They\nhave to know where things are, how things work, what to watch out for.\nAnd then, because you've been here a year and a half and know the\nropes, you have to watch them to see that they stay alive in spite of\nthemselves. The Moon's a new environment and you have to learn how to\nlive in it. There's a lot of things to learn--and some people just\nnever learn.\"\n\n\"You're nursemaid, then.\"\n\n\"I suppose you could call it that.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKlein said, \"You're not a scientist, are you?\"\n\n\"No, you should know that. I came as the pilot of the first ship. We\nmade the bunker out of parts of the ship so there wasn't anything to\ngo back on. I'm a good mechanic and I made myself useful with the\nmachinery. When it occurred to us that somebody was going to have to\nstay over, I volunteered. I thought the others were so important that\nit was better they should take their samples and data back to Earth\nwhen the first relief ship came.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't do it again, though, would you?\"\n\n\"No, I wouldn't.\"\n\n\"Do you think Dahl will do as good a job as you've done here?\"\n\nChapman frowned. \"Frankly, I hadn't thought of that. I don't believe\nI care. I've put in my time; it's somebody else's turn now. He\nvolunteered for it. I think I was fair in explaining all about the job\nwhen you talked it over among yourselves.\"\n\n\"You did, but I don't think Dahl's the man for it. He's too young, too\nmuch of a kid. He volunteered because he thought it made him look like\na hero. He doesn't have the judgment that an older man would have. That\nyou have.\"\n\nChapman turned slowly around and faced Klein.\n\n\"I'm not the indispensable man,\" he said slowly, \"and even if I was, it\nwouldn't make any difference to me. I'm sorry if Dahl is young. So was\nI. I've lost three years up here. And I don't intend to lose any more.\"\n\nKlein held up his hands. \"Look, Chap, I didn't mean you should stay. I\nknow how much you hate it and the time you put in up here. It's just--\"\nHis voice trailed away. \"It's just that I think it's such a damn\nimportant job.\"\n\nKlein had gone out in a last search for rock lichens and Chapman\nenjoyed one of his relatively few moments of privacy. He wandered over\nto his bunk and opened his barracks bag. He checked the underwear and\nhis toothbrush and shaving kit for maybe the hundredth time and pushed\nthe clothing down farther in the canvas. It was foolish because the\nbag was already packed and had been for a week. He remembered stalling\nit off for as long as he could and then the quiet satisfaction about a\nweek before, when he had opened his small gear locker and transferred\nits meager belongings to the bag.\n\nHe hadn't actually needed to pack, of course. In less than twenty-four\nhours he'd be back on Earth where he could drown himself in toothpaste\nand buy more tee shirts than he could wear in a lifetime. He could\nleave behind his shorts and socks and the outsize shirts he had\ninherited from--who was it? Driesbach?--of the First group. Dahl could\nprobably use them or maybe one of the boys in the Third.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut it wasn't like going home unless you packed. It was part of the\nritual, like marking off the last three weeks in pencil on the gray\nsteel of the bulkhead beside his hammock. Just a few hours ago, when he\nwoke up, he had made the last check mark and signed his name and the\ndate. His signature was right beneath Dixon's.\n\nHe frowned when he thought of Dixon and slid back the catch on the top\nof the bag and locked it. They should never have sent a kid like Dixon\nto the Moon.\n\nHe had just locked the bag when he heard the rumble of the airlock and\nthe soft hiss of air. Somebody had come back earlier than expected. He\nwatched the inner door swing open and the spacesuited figure clump in\nand unscrew its helmet.\n\nDahl. He had gone out to help Dowden on the Schmidt telescope. Maybe\nDowden hadn't needed any help, with Bening along. Or more likely,\nconsidering the circumstances, Dahl wasn't much good at helping anybody\ntoday.\n\nDahl stripped off his suit. His face was covered with light beads of\nsweat and his eyes were frightened.\n\nHe moistened his lips slightly. \"Do--do you think they'll ever have\nrelief ships up here more often than every eighteen months, Chap? I\nmean, considering the advance of--\"\n\n\"No,\" Chapman interrupted bluntly. \"I don't. Not at least for ten\nyears. The fuel's too expensive and the trip's too hazardous. On\nfreight charges alone you're worth your weight in platinum when they\nsend you here. Even if it becomes cheaper, Bob, it won't come about\nso it will shorten stopover right away.\" He stopped, feeling a little\nsorry for Dahl. \"It won't be too bad. There'll be new men up here and\nyou'll pass a lot of time getting to know them.\"\n\n\"Well, you see,\" Dahl started, \"that's why I came back early. I wanted\nto see you about stopover. It's that--well, I'll put it this way.\" He\nseemed to be groping for an easy way to say what he wanted to. \"I'm\nengaged back home. Really nice girl, Chap, you'd like her if you knew\nher.\" He fumbled in his pocket and found a photograph and put it on\nthe desk. \"That's a picture of Alice, taken at a picnic we were on\ntogether.\" Chapman didn't look. \"She--we--expected to be married when\nI got back. I never told her about stopover, Chap. She thinks I'll be\nhome tomorrow. I kept thinking, hoping, that maybe somehow--\"\n\nHe was fumbling it badly, Chapman thought.\n\n\"You wanted to trade places with me, didn't you, Bob? You thought I\nmight stay for stopover again, in your place?\"\n\nIt hurt to look in Dahl's eyes. They were the eyes of a man who was\ntrying desperately to stop what he was about to do, but just couldn't\nhelp himself.\n\n\"Well, yes, more or less. Oh, God, Chap, I know you want to go home!\nBut I couldn't ask any of the others; you were the only one who could,\nthe only one who was qualified!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDahl looked as though he was going to be sick. Chapman tried to recall\nall he knew about him. Dahl, Robert. Good mathematician. Graduate from\none of the Ivy League schools. Father was a manufacturer of stoves or\nsomething.\n\nIt still didn't add, not quite. \"You know I don't like it here any more\nthan you do,\" Chapman said slowly. \"I may have commitments at home,\ntoo. What made you think I would change my mind?\"\n\nDahl took the plunge. \"Well, you see,\" he started eagerly, too far gone\nto remember such a thing as pride, \"you know my father's pretty well\nfixed. We would make it worth your while, Chap.\" He was feverish. \"It\nwould mean eighteen more months, Chap, but they'd be well-paid months!\"\n\nChapman felt tired. The good feeling he had about going home was slowly\nevaporating.\n\n\"If you have any report to make, I think you had better get at it,\"\nhe cut in, keeping all the harshness he felt out of his voice. \"It'll\nbe too late after the relief ship leaves. It'll be easier to give the\ncaptain your report than try to radio it back to Earth from here.\"\n\nHe felt sorrier for Dahl than he could ever remember having felt for\nanybody. Long after going home, Dahl would remember this.\n\nIt would eat at him like a cancer.\n\nCowardice is the one thing for which no man ever forgives himself.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDonley was eating a sandwich and looking out the port, so, naturally,\nhe saw the ship first. \"Well, whaddya know!\" he shouted. \"We got\ncompany!\" He dashed for his suit. Dowden and Bening piled after him and\nall three started for the lock.\n\nChapman was standing in front of it. \"Check your suits,\" he said\nsoftly. \"Just be sure to check.\"\n\n\"Oh, what the hell, Chap!\" Donley started angrily. Then he shut up and\nwent over his suit. He got to his tank and turned white. Empty. It was\nonly half a mile to the relief rocket, so somebody would probably have\ngot to him in time, but.... He bit his lips and got a full tank.\n\nChapman and Klein watched them dash across the pumice, making the\ntremendous leaps they used to read about in the Sunday supplements. The\nport of the rocket had opened and tiny figures were climbing down the\nladder. The small figures from the bunker reached them and did a short\njig of welcome. Then the figures linked arms and started back. Chapman\nnoticed one--it was probably Donley--pat the ship affectionately before\nhe started back.\n\nThey were in the lock and the air pumped in and then they were in\nthe bunker, taking off their suits. The newcomers were impressed and\nsolemn, very much aware of the tremendous responsibility that rested on\ntheir shoulders. Like Donley and Klein and the members of the Second\ngroup had been when they had landed. Like Chapman had been in the First.\n\nDonley and the others were all over them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHow was it back on Earth? Who had won the series? Was so-and-so still\nteaching at the university? What was the international situation?\n\nWas the sky still blue, was the grass still green, did the leaves still\nturn color in the autumn, did people still love and cry and were there\nstill people who didn't know what an atom was and didn't give a damn?\n\nChapman had gone through it all before. But was Ginny still Ginny?\n\nSome of the men in the Third had their luggage with them. One of\nthem--a husky, red-faced kid named Williams--was opening a box about a\nfoot square and six inches deep. Chapman watched him curiously.\n\n\"Well, I'll be damned!\" Klein said. \"Hey, guys, look what we've got\nhere!\"\n\nChapman and the others crowded around and suddenly Donley leaned over\nand took a deep breath. In the box, covering a thick layer of ordinary\ndirt, was a plot of grass. They looked at it, awed. Klein put out his\nhand and laid it on top of the grass.\n\n\"I like the feel of it,\" he said simply.\n\nChapman cut off a single blade with his fingernail and put it between\nhis lips. It had been years since he had seen grass and had the luxury\nof walking on it and lying on its cool thickness during those sultry\nsummer nights when it was too hot to sleep indoors.\n\nWilliams blushed. \"I thought we could spare a little water for it and\nmaybe use the ultraviolet lamp on it some of the time. Couldn't help\nbut bring it along; it seemed sort of like a symbol....\" He looked\nembarrassed.\n\nChapman sympathized. If he had had any sense, he'd have tried to\nsmuggle something like that up to the Moon instead of his phonograph.\n\n\"That's valuable grass,\" Dahl said sharply. \"Do you realize that at\ncurrent freight rates up here, it's worth about ten dollars a blade?\"\n\nWilliams looked stricken and somebody said, \"Oh, shut up, Dahl.\"\n\nOne of the men separated from the group and came over to Chapman. He\nheld out his hand and said, \"My name's Eberlein. Captain of the relief\nship. I understand you're in charge here?\"\n\nChapman nodded and shook hands. They hadn't had a captain on the First\nship. Just a pilot and crew. Eberlein looked every inch a captain, too.\nCraggy face, gray hair, the firm chin of a man who was sure of himself.\n\n\"You might say I'm in charge here,\" Chapman said.\n\n\"Well, look, Mr. Chapman, is there any place where we can talk together\nprivately?\"\n\nThey walked over to one corner of the bunker. \"This is about as private\nas we can get, captain,\" Chapman said. \"What's on your mind?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEberlein found a packing crate and made himself comfortable. He looked\nat Chapman.\n\n\"I've always wanted to meet the man who's spent more time here than\nanybody else,\" he began.\n\n\"I'm sure you wanted to see me for more reasons than just curiosity.\"\n\nEberlein took out a pack of cigarets. \"Mind if I smoke?\"\n\nChapman jerked a thumb toward Dahl. \"Ask him. He's in charge now.\"\n\nThe captain didn't bother. He put the pack away. \"You know we have big\nplans for the station,\" he said.\n\n\"I hadn't heard of them.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, _big plans_. They're working on unmanned, open-side rockets\nnow that could carry cargo and sheet steel for more bunkers like this.\nEnable us to enlarge the unit, have a series of bunkers all linked\ntogether. Make good laboratories and living quarters for you people.\"\nHis eyes swept the room. \"Have a little privacy for a change.\"\n\nChapman nodded. \"They could use a little privacy up here.\"\n\nThe captain noticed the pronoun. \"Well, that's one of the reasons why\nI wanted to talk to you, Chapman. The Commission talked it over and\nthey'd like to see you stay. They feel if they're going to enlarge it,\nadd more bunkers and have more men up here, that a man of practical\nexperience should be running things. They figure that you're the only\nman who's capable and who's had the experience.\"\n\nThe captain vaguely felt the approach was all wrong.\n\n\"Is that all?\"\n\nEberlein was ill at ease. \"Naturally you'd be paid well. I don't\nimagine any man would like being here all the time. They're prepared to\ndouble your salary--maybe even a bonus in addition--and let you have\nfull charge. You'd be Director of the Luna Laboratories.\"\n\nAll this and a title too, Chapman thought.\n\n\"That's it?\" Chapman asked.\n\nEberlein frowned. \"Well, the Commission said they'd be willing to\nconsider anything else you had in mind, if it was more money or....\"\n\n\"The answer is no,\" Chapman said. \"I'm not interested in more money\nfor staying because I'm not interested in staying. Money can't buy it,\ncaptain. I'm sorry, but I'm afraid that you'd have to stay up here to\nappreciate that.\n\n\"Bob Dahl is staying for stopover. If there's something important about\nthe project or impending changes, perhaps you'd better tell him before\nyou go.\"\n\nHe walked away.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nChapman held the letter in both hands, but the paper still shook. The\nothers had left the bunker, the men of the Second taking those of\nthe Third in hand to show them the machinery and apparatus that was\noutside, point out the deadly blisters underneath the pumice covering,\nand show them how to keep out of the Sun and how to watch their air\nsupply.\n\nHe was glad he was alone. He felt something trickle down his face and\ntasted salt on his lips.\n\nThe mail had been distributed and he had saved his latest letter until\nthe others had left so he could read it in privacy. It was a short\nletter, very short.\n\nIt started: \"Dear Joel: This isn't going to be a nice letter, but I\nthought it best that you should know before you came home.\"\n\nThere was more to it, but he hadn't even needed to read it to know what\nit said. It wasn't original, of course. Women who change their minds\nweren't exactly an innovation, either.\n\nHe crumpled the paper and held a match to it and watched it burn on the\nsteel floor.\n\nThree years had been a long time. It was too long a time to keep loving\na man who was a quarter of a million miles away. She could look up in\nthe night sky when she was out with somebody else now and tell him how\nshe had once been engaged to the Man in the Moon.\n\nIt would make good conversation. It would be funny. A joke.\n\nHe got up and walked over to his phonograph and put the record on. The\nsomewhat scratchy voice sang as if nothing had happened\n\n     Way Back Home by Al Lewis.\n\nThe record caught and started repeating the last line.\n\nHe hadn't actually wanted to play it. It had been an automatic\nresponse. He had played it lots of times before when he had thought of\nEarth. Of going home.\n\nHe crossed over and threw the record across the bunker and watched it\nshatter on the steel wall and the pieces fall to the floor.\n\nThe others came back in the bunker and the men of the Second started\ngrabbing their bags and few belongings and getting ready to leave.\nDahl sat in a corner, a peculiar expression on his face. He looked as\nif he wanted to cry and yet still felt that the occasion was one for\nrejoicing.\n\nChapman walked over to him. \"Get your stuff and leave with the others,\nDahl.\" His voice was quiet and hard.\n\nDahl looked up, opened his mouth to say something, and then shut\nup. Donley and Bening and Dowden were already in the airlock, ready\nto leave. Klein caught the conversation and came over. He gripped\nChapman's arm.\n\n\"What the hell's going on, Chap? Get your bag and let's go. I know just\nthe bistro to throw a whing-ding when we get--\"\n\n\"I'm not going back,\" Chapman said.\n\nKlein looked annoyed, not believing him. \"Come on, what's the matter\nwith you? You suddenly decide you don't like the blue sky and trees and\nstuff? Let's go!\"\n\nThe men in the lock were looking at them questioningly. Some members\nof the Third looked embarrassed, like outsiders caught in a family\nargument.\n\n\"Look, Julius, I'm not going back,\" Chapman repeated dully. \"I haven't\nanything to go back for.\"\n\n\"You're doing a much braver thing than you may think,\" a voice cut in.\nIt belonged to Eberlein.\n\nChapman looked at him. Eberlein flushed, then turned and walked-stiffly\nto the lock to join the others.\n\nJust before the inner door of the lock shut, they could hear Chapman,\nhis hands on his hips, breaking in the Third on how to be happy and\nstay healthy on the Moon. His voice was ragged and strained and sounded\nlike a top-sergeant's.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDahl and Eberlein stood in the outer port of the relief ship, staring\nback at the research bunker. It was half hidden in the shadows of a\nrocky overhang that protected it from meteorites.\n\n\"They kidded him a lot this morning,\" Dahl said. \"They said he had\nfound a home on the Moon.\"\n\n\"If we had stayed an hour or so more, he might have changed his mind\nand left, after all,\" Eberlein mused, his face a thoughtful mask behind\nhis air helmet.\n\n\"I offered him money,\" Dahl said painfully. \"I was a coward and I\noffered him money to stay in my place.\" His face was bitter and full\nof disgust for himself.\n\nEberlein turned to him quickly and automatically told him the right\nthing.\n\n\"We're all cowards once in a while,\" he said earnestly. \"But your offer\nof money had nothing to do with his staying. He stayed because he had\nto stay, because we made him stay.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" Dahl said.\n\n\"Chapman had a lot to go home for. He was engaged to be married.\" Dahl\nwinced. \"We got her to write him a letter breaking it off. We knew it\nmeant that he lost one of his main reasons for wanting to go back. I\nthink, perhaps, that he still would have left if we had stayed and\nargued him into going. But we left before he could change his mind.\"\n\n\"That--was a lousy thing to do!\"\n\n\"We had no choice. We didn't use it except as a last resort.\"\n\n\"I don't know of any girl who would have done such a thing, no matter\nwhat your reasons, if she was in love with a guy like Chapman,\" Dahl\nsaid.\n\n\"There was only one who would have,\" Eberlein agreed. \"Ginny Dixon. She\nunderstood what we were trying to tell her. She had to; her brother had\ndied up here.\"\n\n\"Why was Chapman so important?\" Dahl burst out. \"What could he have\ndone that I couldn't have done--would have done if I had had any guts?\"\n\n\"Perhaps you could have,\" Eberlein said. \"But I doubt it. I don't think\nthere were many men who could have. And we couldn't take the chance.\nChapman knows how to live on the Moon. He's like a trapper who's spent\nall his time in the forests and knows it like the palm of his hand.\nHe never makes mistakes, he never fails to check things. And he isn't\na scientist. He would never become so preoccupied with research that\nhe'd fail to make checks. And he can watch out for those who do make\nmistakes. Ginny understood that all too well.\"\n\n\"How did you know all this about Chapman?\" Dahl asked.\n\n\"The men in the First told us some of it. And we had our own observer\nwith you here. Bening kept us pretty well informed.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEberlein stared at the bunker thoughtfully.\n\n\"It costs a lot of money to send ships up here and establish a colony.\nIt will cost a lot to expand it. And with that kind of investment, you\ndon't take chances. You have to have the best men for the job. You get\nthem even if they don't want to do it.\"\n\nHe gestured at the small, blotchy globe of blue and green that was the\nEarth, riding high in the black sky.\n\n\"You remember what it was like five years ago, Dahl? Nations at each\nother's throats, re-arming to the teeth? It isn't that way now. We've\ngot the one lead that nobody can duplicate or catch up on. Nobody has\nour technical background. I know, this isn't a military base. But it\ncould become one.\"\n\nHe paused.\n\n\"But these aren't even the most important reasons, Dahl. We're at the\nbeginnings of space travel, the first bare, feeble start. If this base\non the Moon succeeds, the whole human race will be Outward Bound.\" He\nwaved at the stars. \"You have your choice--a frontier that lies in the\nstars, or a psychotic little world that tries and fails and spends its\ntime and talents trying to find better methods of suicide.\n\n\"With a choice like that, Dahl, you can't let it fail. And personal\nlives and viewpoints are expendable. But it's got to be that way.\nThere's too much at stake.\"\n\nEberlein hesitated a moment and when he started again, it was on a\ndifferent track. \"You're an odd bunch of guys, you and the others in\nthe groups, Dahl. Damn few of you come up for the glamor, I know.\nNone of you like it and none of you are really enthusiastic about it.\nYou were all reluctant to come in the first place, for the most part.\nYou're a bunch of pretty reluctant heroes, Dahl.\"\n\nThe captain nodded soberly at the bunker. \"I, personally, don't feel\nhappy about that. I don't like having to mess up other people's lives.\nI hope I won't have to again. Maybe somehow, someway, this one can be\npatched up. We'll try to.\"\n\nHe started the mechanism that closed the port of the rocket. His face\nwas a study of regret and helplessness. He was thinking of a future\nthat, despite what he had told Dahl, wasn't quite real to him.\n\n\"I feel like a cheap son of a bitch,\" Eberlein said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_The very young man said, \"Do they actually care where they send us? Do\nthey actually care what we think?\"_\n\n_The older man got up and walked to the window. The bunkers and towers\nand squat buildings of the research colony glinted in the sunlight. The\ncolony had come a long way; it housed several thousands now._\n\n_The Sun was just rising for the long morning and farther down shadows\nstabbed across the crater floor. Tycho was by far the most beautiful of\nthe craters, he thought._\n\n_It was nice to know that the very young man was going to miss it. It\nhad taken the older man quite a long time to get to like it. But that\nwas to be expected--he hadn't been on the Moon._\n\n_\"I would say so,\" he said. \"They were cruel, that way, at the start.\nBut then they had to be. The goal was too important. And they made up\nfor it as soon as they could. It didn't take them too long to remember\nthe men who had traded their future for the stars.\"_\n\n_The very young man said, \"Did you actually think of it that way when\nyou first came up here?\"_\n\n_The older man thought for a minute. \"No,\" he admitted. \"No, we didn't.\nMost of us were strictly play-for-pay men. The Commission wanted\nmen who wouldn't fall apart when the glamor wore off and there was\nnothing left but privation and hard work and loneliness. The men who\nfell for the glamor were all right for quick trips, but not for an\neighteen-month stay in a research bunker. So the Commission offered\nhigh salaries and we reluctantly took the jobs. Oh, there was the\nidea behind the project, the vision the Commission had in mind. But it\ntook a while for that to grow.\"_\n\n_A woman came in the room just then, bearing a tray with glasses on\nit. The older man took one and said, \"Your mother and I were notified\nyesterday that you had been chosen to go. We would like to see you go,\nbut of course the final decision is up to you.\"_\n\n_He sipped his drink and turned to his wife: \"It has its privations,\nbut in the long run we've never regretted it, have we, Ginny?\"_\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Reluctant Heroes, by Frank M.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
