And of course everyone knows\nthey really don't, which is why they're acceptable.... ]\n\n\nThere are times when I don't know my own strength. Or, at least, the\nstrength of my advice. And the case of Jason Howley was certainly an\ninstance of one of those times.\n\nWhen he came to my office with his gadget, I heard him out, trying to\nappear both interested and co-operative--which is good business. But I\nam forced to admit that neither Howley nor his gadget were very\nimpressive. He was a lean, slope-shouldered individual, five-feet-eight\nor nine--which was shorter than he looked--with straight brown hair\ncombed straight back and blue eyes which were shielded with steel-rimmed\nglasses. The thick, double-concave lenses indicated a degree of myopia\nthat must have bordered on total blindness without glasses, and acute\ntunnel vision, even with them.\n\nHe had a crisp, incisive manner that indicated he was either a man who\nknew what he was doing or a man who was trying to impress me with a\nready-made story. I listened to him and looked at his gadget without\ngiving any more indication than necessary of what I really thought.\n\nWhen he was through, I said: \"You understand, Mr. Howley that I'm not a\npatent lawyer; I specialize in criminal law. Now, I can recommend--\"\n\nBut he cut me off. \"I understand that, counselor,\" he said sharply.\n\"Believe me, I have no illusion whatever that this thing is patentable\nunder the present patent system. Even if it were, this gadget is\ndesigned to do something that may or may not be illegal, which would\nmake it hazardous to attempt to patent it, I should think. You don't\npatent new devices for blowing safes or new drugs for doping horses, do\nyou?\"\n\n\"Probably not,\" I said dryly, \"although, as I say, I'm not qualified to\ngive an opinion on patent law. You say that gadget is designed to cause\nminute, but significant, changes in the velocities of small, moving\nobjects. Just how does that make it illegal?\"\n\nHe frowned a little. \"Well, possibly it wouldn't, except here in Nevada.\nSpecifically, it is designed to influence roulette and dice games.\"\n\nI looked at the gadget with a little more interest this time. There was\nnothing new in the idea of inventing a gadget to cheat the red-and-black\nwheels, of course; the local cops turn up a dozen a day here in the\ncity. Most of them either don't work at all or else they're too obvious,\nso the users get nabbed before they have a chance to use them.\n\nThe only ones that really work have to be installed in the tables\nthemselves, which means they're used to milk the suckers, not rob the\nmanagement. And anyone in the State of Nevada who buys a license to\noperate and then uses crooked wheels is (a) stupid, and (b) out of\nbusiness within a week. Howley was right. Only in a place where gambling\nis legalized is it illegal--and unprofitable--to rig a game.\n\nThe gadget itself didn't look too complicated from the outside. It was a\nblack plastic box about an inch and a half square and maybe three and a\nhalf long. On one end was a lensed opening, half an inch in diameter,\nand on two sides there were flat, silver-colored plates. On the top of\nit, there was a dial which was, say, an inch in diameter, and it was\nmarked off just exactly like a roulette wheel.\n\n\"How does it work?\" I asked.\n\nHe picked it up in his hand, holding it as though it were a flashlight,\nwith the lens pointed away from him.\n\n\"You aim the lens at the wheel,\" he explained, \"making sure that your\nthumb is touching the silver plate on one side, and your fingers\ntouching the plate on the other side. Then you set this dial for\nwhatever number you want to come up and concentrate on it while the ball\nis spinning. For dice, of course, you only need to use the first six or\ntwelve numbers on the dial, depending on the game.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI looked at him for a long moment, trying to figure his angle. He looked\nback steadily, his eyes looking like small beads peering through the\nbottoms of a couple of shot glasses.\n\n\"You look skeptical, counselor,\" he said at last.\n\n\"I am. A man who hasn't got the ability to be healthily skeptical has no\nright to practice law--especially criminal law. On the other hand, no\nlawyer has any right to judge anything one way or the other without\nevidence.\n\n\"But that's neither here nor there at the moment. What I'm interested in\nis, what do you want me to do? People rarely come to a criminal lawyer\nunless they're in a jam. What sort of jam are you in at the moment?\"\n\n\"None,\" said Howley. \"But I will be very soon. I hope.\"\n\nWell, I've heard odder statements than that from my clients. I let it\nride for the moment and looked down at the notes I'd taken while he'd\ntold me his story.\n\n\"You're a native of New York City?\" I asked.\n\n\"That's right. That's what I said.\"\n\n\"And you came out here for what? To use that thing on our Nevada\ntables?\"\n\n\"That's right, counselor.\"\n\n\"Can't you find any games to cheat on back home?\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly. Plenty of them. But they aren't legal. I wouldn't care\nto get mixed up in anything illegal. Besides, it wouldn't suit my\npurpose.\"\n\nThat stopped me for a moment. \"You don't consider cheating illegal? It\ncertainly is in Nevada. In New York, if you were caught at it, you'd\nhave the big gambling interests on your neck; here, you'll have both\nthem _and_ the police after you. _And_ the district attorney's office.\"\n\nHe smiled. \"Yes, I know. That's what I'm expecting. That's why I need a\ngood lawyer to defend me. I understand you're the top man in this city.\"\n\n\"Mr. Howley,\" I said carefully, \"as a member of the Bar Association and\na practicing attorney in the State of Nevada, I am an Officer of the\nCourt. If you had been caught cheating and had come to me, I'd be able\nto help you. But I can't enter into a conspiracy with you to defraud\nlegitimate businessmen, which is exactly what this would be.\"\n\nHe blinked at me through those shot-glass spectacles. \"Counselor, would\nyou refuse to defend a man if you thought he was guilty?\"\n\nI shook my head. \"No. Legally, a man is not guilty until proven so by a\ncourt of law. He has a right to trial by jury. For me to refuse to give\na man the defense he is legally entitled to, just because I happened to\nthink he was guilty, would be trial by attorney. I'll do the best I can\nfor any client; I'll work for his interests, no matter what my private\nopinion may be.\"\n\nHe looked impressed, so I guess there must have been a note of\nconviction in my voice. There should have been, because it was exactly\nwhat I've always believed and practiced.\n\n\"That's good, counselor,\" said Howley. \"If I can convince you that I\nhave no criminal intent, that I have no intention of defrauding anyone\nor conspiring with you to do anything illegal, will you help me?\"\n\nI didn't have to think that one over. I simply said, \"Yes.\" After all,\nit was still up to me to decide whether he convinced me or not. If he\ndidn't, I could still refuse the case on those grounds.\n\n\"That's fair enough, counselor,\" he said. Then he started talking.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nInstead of telling you what Jason Howley _said_ he was going to do, I'll\ntell you what he _did_ do. They are substantially the same, anyway, and\nthe old bromide about actions speaking louder than words certainly\napplied in this case.\n\nMind you, I didn't see or hear any of this, but there were plenty of\nwitnesses to testify as to what went on. Their statements are a matter\nof court record, and Jason Howley's story is substantiated in every\nrespect.\n\nHe left my office smiling. He'd convinced me that the case was not only\ngoing to be worthwhile, but fun. I took it, plus a fat retainer.\n\nHowley went up to his hotel room, changed into his expensive evening\nclothes, and headed out to do the town. I'd suggested several places,\nbut he wanted the biggest and best--the Golden Casino, a big, plush,\nexpensive place that was just inside the city limits. In his pockets, he\nwas carrying less than two hundred dollars in cash.\n\nNow, nobody with that kind of chicken feed can expect to last long at\nthe Golden Casino unless they stick to the two-bit one-armed bandits.\nBut putting money on a roulette table is in a higher bracket by far than\nfeeding a slot machine, even if you get a steady run of lemons.\n\nHowley didn't waste any time. He headed for the roulette table right\naway. He watched the play for about three spins of the wheel, then he\ntook out his gadget--in plain sight of anyone who cared to watch--and\nset the dial for thirteen. Then he held it in his hand with thumb and\nfinger touching the plates and put his hand in his jacket pocket, with\nthe lens aimed at the wheel. He stepped up to the table, bought a\nhundred dollars worth of chips, and put fifty on Number Thirteen.\n\n\"No more bets,\" said the croupier. He spun the wheel and dropped the\nball.\n\n\"Thirteen, Black, Odd, and Low,\" he chanted after a minute. With a\npracticed hand, he raked in the losers and pushed out Howley's winnings.\nThere was sixteen hundred dollars sitting on thirteen now. Howley didn't\ntouch it.\n\nThe wheel went around and the little ball clattered around the rim and\nfinally fell into a slot.\n\n\"Thirteen, Black, Odd, and Low,\" said the croupier. This time, he didn't\nlook as nonchalant. He peered curiously at Howley as he pushed out the\nchips to make a grand total of fifty-one thousand two hundred dollars.\nThe same number doesn't come up twice in succession very often, and it\nis very rare indeed that the same person is covering it both times with\na riding bet.\n\n\"Two thousand limit, sir,\" the croupier said, when it looked as though\nHowley was going to let the fifty-one grand just sit there.\n\nHowley nodded apologetically and pulled off everything but two thousand\ndollars worth of chips.\n\nThe third time around, the croupier had his eyes directly on Howley as\nhe repeated the chant: \"Thirteen, Black, Odd, and Low.\" Everybody else\nat the table was watching Howley, too. The odds against Howley--or\nanyone else, for that matter--hitting the same number three times in a\nrow are just under forty thousand to one.\n\nHowley didn't want to overdo it. He left two thousand on thirteen, raked\nin the rest, and twisted the dial on his gadget over a notch.\n\nEveryone at the table gasped as the little ball dropped.\n\n\"That was a near miss,\" whispered a woman standing nearby.\n\nThe croupier said: \"Fourteen, Red, Even, and Low.\" And he raked in\nHowley's two thousand dollars with a satisfied smile. He had seen runs\nof luck before.\n\nHowley deliberately lost two more spins the same way. Nobody who was\nactually cheating would call too much attention to himself, and Howley\nwanted it to look as though he were trying to cover up the fact that he\nhad a sure thing.\n\nHe took the gadget out of his pocket and deliberately set it to the\ngreen square marked 00. Then he put it back in his pocket and put two\nthousand dollars on the Double Zero.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was more than suspicion in the croupier's eyes when he raked in\nall the bets on the table except Howley's. It definitely didn't look\ngood to him. A man who had started out with a fifty-dollar bet had\nmanaged to run it up to one hundred seventy-four thousand two hundred\ndollars in six plays.\n\nHowley looked as innocent as possible under the circumstances, and\ncarefully dropped the dial on his gadget back a few notches. Then he bet\nanother two thousand on High, an even money bet.\n\nNaturally, he won.\n\nHe twisted the dial back a few more notches and won again on High.\n\nThen he left it where it was and won by betting on Red.\n\nBy this time, of course, things were happening. The croupier had long\nsince pressed the alarm button, and five men had carefully surrounded\nHowley. They looked like customers, but they were harder-looking than\nthe average, and they were watching Howley, not the wheel. Farther back\nfrom the crowd, three of the special deputies from the sheriff's office\nwere trying to look inconspicuous in their gray uniforms and white\nStetsons and pearl-handled revolvers in black holsters. You can imagine\nhow inconspicuous they looked.\n\nHowley decided to do it up brown. He reset his gadget as surreptitiously\nas possible under the circumstances, and put his money on thirteen\nagain.\n\n\"Thirteen, Black, Odd, and Low,\" said the croupier in a hollow voice.\n\nThe five men in evening dress and the three deputies moved in closer.\n\nHowley nonchalantly scraped in his winnings, leaving the two thousand on\nthe thirteen spot.\n\nThere was a combination of hostility and admiration in every eye around\nthe table when the croupier said, \"Thirteen, Black, Odd, and Low\" for\nthe fifth time in the space of minutes. And everyone of those eyes was\nturned on Jason Howley.\n\nThe croupier smiled his professional smile. \"I'm sorry, ladies and\ngentlemen; we'll have to discontinue play for a while. The gentleman has\nbroken the bank at this table.\" He turned the smile on Howley.\n\"Congratulations, sir.\"\n\nHowley smiled back and began stacking up over three hundred thousand\ndollars worth of plastic disks. It made quite a pile.\n\nOne of the deputies stepped up politely. \"I'm an officer, sir,\" he said.\n\"May I help you carry that to the cashier's office?\"\n\nHowley looked at the gold star and nodded. \"Certainly. Thanks.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe other two deputies stepped up, too, and the three of them walked\nHowley toward the cashier's office. Behind them came the five men in\ndinner jackets.\n\n\"You'll have to step into the office to cash that much, sir,\" said one\nof the deputies as he opened the door. Howley walked in as though he\nhadn't a care in the world. He put his chips on the desk, and the\ndeputies followed suit, while one of the dinner-jacketed men closed the\ndoor.\n\nThen one of the deputies said: \"I believe this gentleman is carrying a\ngun.\"\n\nHe had his own revolver out and had it pointed at Howley's middle.\n\"Carrying a concealed weapon is illegal in this city,\" he went on. \"I'm\nafraid we'll have to search you.\"\n\nHowley didn't object. He put his hands up high and stood there while his\npockets were frisked.\n\n\"Well, well,\" said the deputy coolly. \"What on Earth is this?\"\n\nIt was Howley's gadget, and the dial still pointed to Thirteen--Black,\nOdd, and Low.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next morning, I went down to the jail in response to a phone call\nfrom Howley. The special deputies had turned him over to the city police\nand he was being held \"under suspicion of fraud.\" I knew we could beat\nthat down to an \"attempt to defraud,\" but the object was to get Howley\noff scott-free. After Howley told me the whole story, I got busy pushing\nthe case through. As long as he was simply being held on suspicion, I\ncouldn't get him out on bail, so I wanted to force the district attorney\nor the police to prefer charges.\n\nMeanwhile, I made sure that Howley's gadget had been impounded as\nevidence. I didn't want anyone fiddling with it before the case went to\ncourt--except, of course, the D. A. and his men. There wasn't much I\ncould do to keep it out of _their_ hands.\n\nAfter throwing as much weight around as I could, including filing a\npetition for a writ of habeas corpus with Judge Grannis, I went over to\nHowley's hotel with a signed power of attorney that Howley had given me,\nand I got a small envelope out of the hotel safe. It contained a baggage\ncheck.\n\nI went over to the bus depot, turned over the check to the baggage\ndepartment, and went back to my office with a small suitcase. I locked\nmyself in and opened the case. Sure enough, it contained three dozen of\nthe little gadgets.\n\nThen I sat down to wait. By noon, Judge Grannis had issued the writ of\nhabeas corpus, and, rather than release Jason Howley, the police had\nbooked him, and District Attorney Thursby was getting the case ready for\nthe grand jury. There was over a quarter of a million dollars at stake,\nand the men behind the Golden Casino were bringing pressure to bear. If\nHowley wasn't convicted, they'd have to give him his money--and that was\nthe last thing they wanted to do. A quarter of a million bucks isn't\nsmall potatoes, even to a gambling syndicate.\n\nIt wasn't until early on the morning of the third day after Howley's\narrest that I got a tip-off from one of my part-time spies. I scooped up\nthe phone when it rang and identified myself.\n\n\"Counselor? Look, this is Benny.\" I recognized the voice and name. Benny\nwas one of the cabbies that I'd done favors for in the past.\n\n\"What's the trouble, Benny?\"\n\n\"Oh, no trouble. I just got a little tip you might be interested in.\"\n\n\"Fire away.\"\n\n\"Well, the D.A. and some of his boys went into the Golden Casino about\nten minutes ago, and now they're closin' up the place. Just for a little\nwhile, I understand. Hour, maybe. They're chasin' everyone out of the\nroulette room.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Benny,\" I said, \"thanks a lot.\"\n\n\"Well, I knew you was working on that Howley case, and I thought this\nmight be important, so I--\"\n\n\"Sure, Benny. Come by my office this afternoon. And thanks again.\"\n\nI hung up and started moving.\n\nWithin ten minutes, I was pulling up and parking across the street from\nthe Golden Casino. I locked the car and dodged traffic to get across the\nstreet, as though I'd never heard of laws against jaywalking.\n\nThere were still plenty of people in the Casino. The bar was full, and\nthe dice and card games were going full blast. The slot machines were\njingling out their infernal din while fools fed coins into their\ninsatiable innards.\n\nBut the roulette room was closed, and a couple of be-Stetsoned deputies\nwere standing guard over the entrance. I headed straight for them.\n\nBoth of them stood pat, blocking my way, so I stopped a few feet in\nfront of them.\n\n\"Hello, counselor,\" said one. \"Sorry, the roulette room's closed.\"\n\nI knew the man slightly. \"Let me in, Jim,\" I said. \"I want to see\nThursby.\"\n\nThe men exchanged glances. Obviously, the D.A. had given them orders.\n\n\"Can't do it, counselor,\" said Jim. \"We're not to let anyone in.\"\n\n\"Tell Thursby I'm out here and that I want to see him.\"\n\nHe shrugged, opened the door, stuck his head inside, and called to\nDistrict Attorney Thursby to tell him that I was outside. I could hear\nThursby's muffled \"Damn!\" from within. But when he showed up at the\ndoor, his face was all smiles.\n\n\"What's the trouble?\" he asked pleasantly.\n\nI smiled back, giving him my best. \"No trouble at all, Thursby. I just\nwanted to watch the experiment.\"\n\n\"Experiment?\" He looked honestly surprised, which was a fine piece of\nacting. \"We're just checking to see if the table's wired, that's all. If\nit is, your client may be in the clear; maybe we can hang it on the\ncroupier.\"\n\n\"And get a conspiracy charge on my client, too, eh? Well, if you don't\nmind, I'd like to watch that table check myself. You know how it is.\"\n\nThursby hesitated, then he scowled. \"Oh, all right. Come on in. But stay\nout of the way.\"\n\nI grinned. \"Sure. All I want to do is protect my client's interests.\"\n\nThursby just grunted and opened the door wider to let me in. He was a\nshrewd lawyer, a good D.A., and basically honest, even if he did have a\ntendency to bend under pressure from higher up.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were checking the table, all right. They had three specialists\ngoing over it with everything from fine tooth combs to Geiger counters.\nThey found nothing. No magnets, no wires, no mechanical gimmicks.\nNothing.\n\nIt took them an hour to take that table apart, check it, and put it back\ntogether again. When it was all over, Thursby glanced at me, then said:\n\"O.K., boys; that does it. Let's go.\"\n\nThe men looked at him oddly, and I knew why.\n\n\"Aren't you going to test my client's gadget?\" I asked innocently.\n\nThursby looked angrily baffled for a moment, then he clamped his lips\ngrimly. \"As long as we're here, I guess we might as well.\"\n\nI knew perfectly well it was what he had intended to do all along.\n\n\"One of you guys spin that wheel,\" he said to the technicians. One of\nthem gave the wheel a spin and dropped the ball. It clattered on its\nmerry way and dropped into a slot. Forty-two.\n\nThursby took the gadget out of his pocket. It was still set at Thirteen.\n\nThe men who had surrounded Howley on the night of his arrest had been\nkeeping their eyes open, and they had seen how Howley had handled the\nthing. Well--_almost_ how. Thursby had the lens opening pointed at the\nwheel, but his thumb and fingers weren't touching the silver plates\nproperly.\n\n\"Spin it again,\" he said.\n\nEveryone's eyes were on the ball as it whirled, so I had time to get my\nown copy of Howley's gadget out and set it at Thirteen. I hoped the\nthing would work for me. I concentrated on Thirteen, making sure my\nthumb and fingers were placed right.\n\nEvidently they were. The ball fell into Thirteen, Black, Odd, and Low.\n\nA huge grin spread over Thursby's face, but he was man enough not to\nturn and grin at me. \"Try it again,\" he said.\n\nThirteen, Black, Odd, and Low.\n\n\"I wonder how the thing works?\" said Thursby, looking at the gadget in a\nsort of pleased awe.\n\n\"You'd better be able to prove that it _does_ work, Thursby,\" I said,\ntrying to put irritation into my voice.\n\nThis time, he did grin at me. \"Oh, I think we can prove that, all\nright.\" He turned back to the technician. \"Spin it once more, Sam, and\nshow the defense counsel, here, how it works.\"\n\nThe technician did as he was told. \"Thirteen, Black, Odd, and Low,\" he\nchanted, grinning.\n\n\"Let's try another number,\" Thursby said. He turned the dial to One. And\nthis time, when he pointed it, his fingers were touching the plates in\nthe right places.\n\n\"Just a minute,\" I said. \"Let me spin that thing.\"\n\n\"Be my guest, counselor,\" said Thursby.\n\nI spun the wheel and scooted the ball along the rim. It dropped into a\nslot. One, Red, Odd, and Low. I looked as disappointed and apprehensive\nas I could.\n\n\"Co-incidence,\" I said. \"Nothing more. You haven't proved anything.\"\n\nThursby's grin widened. \"Of course I haven't,\" he said with a soothing,\npatronizing tone. \"But I don't have to prove anything until I get to\ncourt.\"\n\nThen he looked at the technicians and jerked his head toward the door.\n\"Let's go, boys. Maybe the counselor wants to look over the table for\nhimself. Maybe he thinks we've got it rigged.\"\n\nThere was a chorus of guffaws as they walked out. I just stood there,\nscowling, trying to keep from laughing even harder than they were.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJason Howley sat next to me at the defense table, just inside the low\npartition that divided the court from the public. There weren't many\npeople in the auditorium itself; listening to some poor dope get himself\nsentenced for cheating at gambling is considered pretty dull\nentertainment in the State of Nevada.\n\nThursby had managed to push the indictment through the grand jury in a\nhurry, but, as he sat across the room from me at the prosecution table,\nI thought I could detect a false note in the assumed look of confidence\nthat he was trying to wear.\n\nHowley tapped me on the shoulder. I turned around, and he whispered:\n\"How much longer?\"\n\nI tapped my wrist watch. \"Couple minutes. Judge Lapworth is one of those\nprecisionists. Never a moment late or early. Getting jumpy?\"\n\nHe shook his head gently and smiled. \"No. You've handled this even\nbetter than I'd have imagined. You thought of things I didn't even know\nexisted. I'm no lawyer; I can see that.\"\n\nI returned the smile. \"And I don't invent gimmicks, either. So what?\"\n\nHis eyes looked at me from behind the distorting negative lenses. \"I've\nbeen wondering, counselor--why are you so interested in this? I mean, I\noffered you a pretty good fee, and all that, but it seems to me you're\ntaking an unusual interest in the case.\"\n\nI grinned at him. \"Mr. Howley, my profession is Law--with a capital L.\nThe study of the Law isn't like the study of physics or whatever; these\nare manmade laws--commands, not descriptions. They don't necessarily\nhave anything to do with facts at all. Take the word 'insanity,' for\ninstance; the word isn't even used by head-shrinkers any more because\nit's a legal definition that has nothing whatever to do with the\ncondition of the human mind.\n\n\"Now, any such set of laws as that can't possibly be self-consistent and\nstill have some use on an action level. A lawyer's job is to find the\nlittle inconsistencies in the structure, the places where the pieces\nhave been jammed together in an effort to make them look like a\nstructured whole. To find, in other words, the loopholes and use them.\n\n\"And when I find a loophole, I like to wring everything I can out of it.\nI'm enjoying this.\"\n\nHowley nodded. \"I see. But what if something--\"\n\nI held up my hand to silence him, because the door to the judges'\nchambers opened at that moment, and Judge Lapworth came in as the\nbailiff announced him. We all stood up while the bailiff intoned his\n\"Oyez, oyez.\"\n\nThursby made a short preliminary speech to the jury, and I requested and\nwas granted permission to hold my own opening statement until the\ndefense was ready to present its case.\n\nThursby was looking worried, although it took a trained eye to see it. I\nwas pretty sure I knew why. He had been pushed too hard and had gone too\nfast. He'd managed to slide through the grand jury too easily, and I had\nmanaged to get the trial date set for a week later. Thursby's case was\nfar from being as tight as he wanted it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI just sat still while the prosecution brought forth its witnesses and\nevidence. The croupier, the deputies, several employees of the Golden\nCasino, and a couple of patrons all told their stories. I waived\ncross-examination in every case, which made Thursby even edgier than he\nhad been.\n\nWhen he called in the head of the technicians who had inspected the\ntable at the casino, I made no objection to his testimony, but I made my\nfirst cross-examination.\n\n\"Mr. Thompson, you have stated your qualifications as an expert on the\nvarious devices which have been used to illegally influence the\noperation of gambling devices in this state.\"\n\nThursby said: \"Oh, if the Court please, I should like to remind counsel\nfor the defense that he has already accepted the qualifications of the\nwitness.\"\n\n\"I am not attempting to impugn the qualifications of the witness,\" I\nsnapped.\n\nJudge Lapworth frowned at Thursby. \"Are you making an objection, Mr.\nDistrict Attorney?\"\n\nThursby pursed his lips, said, \"No, Your Honor,\" and sat down.\n\n\"Proceed with the cross-examination,\" said the judge.\n\n\"Mr. Thompson,\" I said, \"you have testified that you examined the table\nat the Golden Casino for such devices and found none. Is that right?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" he said positively.\n\n\"Have you seen the device labeled People's Exhibit A, which was found by\nthe officers on the person of the defendant?\"\n\n\"Well ... yes. I have.\"\n\n\"Have you examined this device?\"\n\nThursby was on his feet. \"Objection, Your Honor! This material was not\nbrought out in direct examination!\"\n\n\"Sustained,\" said Judge Lapworth.\n\n\"Very well, Your Honor,\" I said. Then I turned back to Thompson. \"As an\nexpert in this field, Mr. Thompson, you have examined many different\ndevices for cheating gambling equipment, haven't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have.\"\n\n\"How many, would you say?\"\n\n\"Oh ... several hundred.\"\n\n\"Several hundred different _types_?\"\n\n\"No. Several hundred individual devices. Most of them are just\nvariations of two or three basic types.\"\n\n\"And you are familiar with the function of these basic types and their\nvariations?\"\n\n\"I am.\"\n\n\"You know exactly how all of them work, then?\"\n\nHe saw where I was heading. \"Most of them,\" he hedged.\n\nThursby saw where I was heading, too, and was sweating. I'd managed to\nget around his objection.\n\n\"Have you ever examined any which you could not understand?\"\n\n\"I ... I don't quite know what you mean.\"\n\n\"Have you ever,\" I said firmly, \"come across a device used in cheating\nwhich you could not comprehend or explain the operation of?\"\n\nThursby stood up. \"Same objection as before, Your Honor.\"\n\n\"Your Honor,\" I said, \"I am merely trying to find the limitations of the\nwitness' knowledge; I am not trying to refute his acknowledged ability.\"\n\n\"Overruled,\" said Judge Lapworth. \"The witness will answer the\nquestion.\"\n\nI repeated the question.\n\n\"Yes,\" Thompson said in a low voice.\n\n\"More than once?\"\n\n\"Only once.\"\n\n\"Only once. You did find one device which didn't operate in any fashion\nyou can explain. Is that right?\"\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\n\"Can you tell me what this device was?\"\n\nThompson took a deep breath. \"It was People's Exhibit A--the device\ntaken from the defendant at the time of his arrest.\"\n\nThere was a buzz in the courtroom.\n\n\"No more questions,\" I said, turning away. Then, before Thompson could\nleave the stand, I turned back to him. \"Oh, just one moment, Mr.\nThompson. Did you examine this device carefully? Did you take it apart?\"\n\n\"I opened it and looked at it.\"\n\n\"You just looked at it? You didn't subject it to any tests?\"\n\nThompson took a deep breath. \"No.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"There wasn't anything inside it to test.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis time, there was more than just a buzz around the courtroom. Judge\nLapworth rapped for order.\n\nWhen the room was quiet, I said: \"The box was empty, then?\"\n\n\"Well, no. Not exactly empty. It had some stuff in it.\"\n\nI turned to the judge. \"If the Court please, I would like to have the\nso-called device, Exhibit A, opened so that the members of the jury may\nsee for themselves what it contains.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nJudge Lapworth said: \"The Court would like very much to see the internal\nworkings of this device, too. Bailiff, if you will, please.\"\n\nThe bailiff handed him the gadget from the exhibit table.\n\n\"How does it open?\" asked the judge. He turned to Thompson. \"Will the\nwitness please open the box?\"\n\nReluctantly, Thompson thumbed the catch and slid off the top.\n\nThe judge took it from him, looked inside, and stared for a long moment.\n\nI had already seen the insides. It was painted white, and there were\ninked lines running all over the inside, and various pictures--a ball, a\npair of dice, a roulette wheel--and some other symbols that I didn't\npretend to understand.\n\nOtherwise, the box was empty.\n\nAfter a moment, Judge Lapworth looked up from the box and stared at\nThursby. Then he looked at Thompson. \"Just what tests _did_ you perform\non this ... this thing, Mr. Thompson?\"\n\n\"Well, Your Honor,\" Thompson said, visibly nervous, \"I checked it for\nall kinds of radiation and magnetism. There isn't anything like that\ncoming from it. But,\" he added lamely, \"there wasn't much else to test.\nNot without damaging the box.\"\n\n\"I see.\" His honor glared at Thursby, but didn't say anything to him. He\nsimply ordered the box to be shown to the jury.\n\nThursby was grimly holding his ground, waiting.\n\n\"Have you any more questions, counselor?\" the judge asked.\n\n\"No, Your Honor, I have not.\"\n\n\"Witness may step down,\" said his honor to Thompson.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThursby stood up. \"If the Court please, I would like to stage a small\ndemonstration for the members of the jury.\"\n\nThe Court gave permission, and a roulette wheel was hauled in on a small\ntable.\n\nI watched with interest and without objection while Thursby demonstrated\nthe use of the gadget and then asked each of the jurors in turn to try\nit. It was a long way from being a successful demonstration. Some of the\njurors didn't hold the thing right, and some of those that did just\ndidn't have the mental ability required to use it. But that didn't\nbother Thursby.\n\n\"Your Honor, and Gentlemen of the Jury,\" he said, \"you are all aware\nthat a device constructed for the purpose of cheating at any gambling\ngame is not necessarily one hundred per cent infallible. It doesn't have\nto be. All it has to do is turn the odds in favor of the user.\n\n\"You are all familiar with loaded dice, I'm sure. And you know that\nloading dice for one set of numbers merely increases the probability\nthat those numbers will come up; it does not guarantee that they will\ncome up every time.\n\n\"It is the same with marked cards. Marking the backs of a deck of cards\ndoesn't mean that you will invariably get a better hand than your\nopponent; it doesn't even mean that you will win every hand.\n\n\"The device taken from the defendant at the Golden Casino does not, as\nyou have seen, work every time. But, as you have also seen, it certainly\n_does_ shift the odds by a considerable percentage. And that, I submit,\nis illegal under the laws of this state.\"\n\nHe went on, building on that theme for a while, then he turned the trial\nover to the defense.\n\n\"Call Dr. Pettigrew to the stand,\" I said.\n\nI heard Thursby's gasp, but I ignored it.\n\nA chunky, balding man with a moon face and an irritated expression came\nup to be sworn in. He was irritated with me for having subpoenaed him,\nand he showed it. I hoped he wouldn't turn out to be hostile.\n\n\"You are Dr. Herbert Pettigrew?\" I asked.\n\n\"That is correct.\"\n\n\"State your residence, please.\"\n\n\"3109 La Jolla Boulevard, Los Angeles, California.\"\n\n\"You are called 'Doctor' Pettigrew, I believe. Would you tell the Court\nwhat right you have to that title?\"\n\nHe looked a little miffed, but he said: \"It is a scholarly title. A\nDoctorate of Philosophy in physics from Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology.\"\n\n\"I see. Would you mind telling the Court what other academic degrees you\nhave?\"\n\nHe reeled off a list of them, all impressive.\n\n\"Thank you, doctor,\" I said. \"Now, what is your present occupation?\"\n\n\"I am a Professor of Physics, at the University of California in Los\nAngeles.\"\n\nI went on questioning him to establish his ability in his field, and by\nthe time I was finished, the jury was pretty well impressed with his\nstatus in the scientific brotherhood. And not once did Thursby object.\n\nThen I said, \"Dr. Pettigrew, I believe you came to this city on a\nprofessional matter?\"\n\n\"Yes, I did.\" He didn't hesitate to answer, so I figured I hadn't got\nhis goat too much.\n\n\"And what was the nature of that matter?\"\n\n\"I was asked to come here by Mr. Harold Thursby, the District Attorney,\nto perform some scientific tests on the ... er ... device ... the device\nknown as People's Exhibit A.\"\n\n\"Did you perform these tests?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"At the request of District Attorney Thursby, is that right?\"\n\n\"That is correct.\"\n\n\"May I ask why Mr. Thursby did not call you as a witness for the\nprosecution?\"\n\nThursby, as I had expected, was on his feet. \"Objection! The question\ncalls for a conclusion of the witness!\"\n\n\"Sustained,\" said Judge Lapworth.\n\n\"Dr. Pettigrew,\" I said, \"what were your findings in reference to\nExhibit A?\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"The thing is a plastic box with a dial set in one side, a\nplastic lens in one end, and a couple of strips of silver along two\nother sides. Inside, there are a lot of markings in black ink on white\npaint.\" He gestured toward the exhibit table. \"Just what you've seen;\nthat's all there is to it.\"\n\n\"What sort of tests did you perform to determine this, Dr. Pettigrew?\" I\nasked.\n\nHe took a long time answering that one. He had X-rayed the thing\nthoroughly, tested it with apparatus I'd never heard of, taken scrapings\nfrom all over it for microchemical analysis, and even tried it himself\non a roulette wheel. He hadn't been able to make it work.\n\n\"And what is your conclusion from these findings?\" I asked.\n\nAgain he shrugged. \"The thing is just a box, that's all. It has no\nspecial properties.\"\n\n\"Would you say that it could be responsible for the phenomena we have\njust seen? By that, I mean the peculiar action of the roulette wheel,\ndemonstrated here by the prosecution.\"\n\n\"Definitely not,\" he stated flatly. \"The box could not possibly have any\neffect on either the wheel or the ball.\"\n\n\"I see. Thank you, doctor; that's all. Cross-examine.\"\n\nThursby walked over to the witness stand with a belligerent scowl on his\nface. \"Dr. Pettigrew, you say that the box couldn't possibly have had\nany effect on the wheel. And yet, we have demonstrated that there _is_\nan effect. Don't you believe the testimony of your own senses?\"\n\n\"Certainly I do!\" snapped Pettigrew.\n\n\"Then how do you account for the behavior of the roulette wheel as you\nhave just seen it demonstrated in this court?\"\n\nI suppressed a grin. Thursby was so mad that he was having trouble\nexpressing himself clearly.\n\n\"In several ways!\" Pettigrew said sharply. \"In the first place, that\nwheel could be rigged.\"\n\nThursby purpled. \"Now, just a minute! I--\"\n\nI started to object, but Judge Lapworth beat me to it.\n\n\"Are you objecting to the answer, Mr. District Attorney?\"\n\n\"The witness is insinuating that I falsified evidence!\"\n\n\"I am not!\" said Pettigrew, visibly angry. \"You asked me how I could\naccount for its behavior, and I told you one way! There are others!\"\n\n\"The wheel will be examined,\" said Judge Lapworth darkly. \"Tell us the\nother ways, Dr. Pettigrew.\"\n\n\"Pure chance,\" said Pettigrew. \"Pure chance, Your Honor. I'm sure that\neveryone in this courtroom has seen runs of luck on a roulette wheel.\nAccording to the laws of probability, such runs must inevitably happen.\nFrankly, I believe that just such a run has occurred here. I do not\nthink for a minute that Mr. Thursby or anyone else rigged that wheel.\"\n\n\"I see; thank you, Dr. Pettigrew,\" said the judge. \"Any further\nquestions, Mr. District Attorney?\"\n\n\"No further questions,\" Thursby said, trying to hide his anger.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Call your next witness,\" said the judge, looking at me.\n\n\"I call Mr. Jason Howley to the stand.\"\n\nHowley sat down and was sworn in. I went through the preliminaries, then\nasked: \"Mr. Howley, you have seen People's Exhibit A?\"\n\n\"I have.\"\n\n\"To whom does it belong?\"\n\n\"It is mine. It was taken from me by--\"\n\n\"Just answer the question, please,\" I admonished him. He knew his\nscript, but he was jumping the gun. \"The device is yours, then?\"\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\n\"Under what circumstances did this device come into the hands of the\npolice?\"\n\nHe told what had happened on the night of the big take at the Golden\nCasino.\n\n\"Would you explain to us just what this device is?\" I asked when he had\nfinished.\n\n\"Certainly,\" he said. \"It's a good luck charm.\"\n\nI could hear the muffled reaction in the courtroom.\n\n\"A good luck charm. I see. Then it has no effect on the wheel at all?\"\n\n\"Oh, I wouldn't say that,\" Howley said disarmingly. He smiled and looked\nat the jury. \"It certainly has _some_ effect. It's the only good luck\ncharm I ever had that worked.\"\n\nThe jury was grinning right back at him. They were all gamblers at\nheart, and I never knew a gambler yet who didn't have some sort of good\nluck charm or superstition when it came to gambling. We had them all in\nthe palms of our hands.\n\n\"What I mean is, does it have any _physical_ effect on the wheel?\"\n\nHowley looked puzzled. \"Well, I don't know about that. That's not my\nfield. You better ask Dr. Pettigrew.\"\n\nThere was a smothered laugh somewhere in the courtroom.\n\n\"Just how do you operate this good luck charm, Mr. Howley?\" I asked.\n\n\"Why, you just hold it so that your thumb touches one strip of silver\nand your fingers touch the other, then you set the dial to whatever\nnumber you want to come up and wish.\"\n\n\"_Wish?_ Just _wish_, Mr. Howley?\"\n\n\"Just wish. That's all. What else can you do with a good luck charm?\"\n\nThis time, the judge had to pound for order to stop the laughing.\n\nI turned Howley over to Thursby.\n\nThe D.A. hammered at him for half an hour trying to get something out of\nHowley, but he didn't get anywhere useful. Howley admitted that he'd\ncome to Nevada to play the wheels; what was wrong with that? He admitted\nthat he'd come just to try out his good luck charm--and what was wrong\nwith that? He even admitted that it worked for him every time--\n\nAnd what was wrong, pray, with _that_?\n\nThursby knew he was licked. He'd known it for a long time. His summation\nto the jury showed it. The expressions on the faces of the jury as they\nlistened showed it.\n\nThey brought in a verdict of Not Guilty.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I got back to my office, I picked up the phone and called the\nGolden Casino. I asked for George Brockey, the manager. When I got him\non the phone and identified myself, he said, \"Oh. It's you.\" His voice\ndidn't sound friendly.\n\n\"It's me,\" I said.\n\n\"I suppose you're going to slap a suit for false arrest on the Casino\nnow, eh, counselor?\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it, George,\" I said. \"The thought occurred to me, but I\nthink we can come to terms.\"\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"Nothing to it, George. You give us the three hundred grand and we don't\ndo a thing.\"\n\n\"Yeah?\" He didn't get it. He had to fork over the money anyway,\naccording to the court order, so what was the deal?\n\n\"If you want to go a little further, I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll\ngive you one of our little good luck charms, if you'll promise to call\nyour boys off Howley.\"\n\n\"Nobody's on Howley,\" he said. \"You ought to know better than that. In\nthis state, if we get whipped in court, we play it square. Did you think\nwe were going to get rough?\"\n\n\"No. But you kind of figured on lifting that gadget as soon as he gets\nit back from the D.A., didn't you? I saw your boys waiting at his hotel.\nI'm just telling you that you don't have to do that. We'll give you the\ngadget. There are plenty more where that came from.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Brockey said after a long pause. \"O.K., counselor. It's a\ndeal.\"\n\n\"Fine. We'll pick up the money later this evening, if that's O.K.\"\n\n\"Sure, counselor. Anytime. Anytime at all.\" He hung up.\n\nI grinned at Howley, who was sitting across the desk from me. \"Well,\nthat winds it up.\"\n\n\"I don't get it,\" Howley said. \"Why'd you call up Brockey? What was the\npurpose of that 'deal'?\"\n\n\"No deal,\" I told him. \"I was just warning him that killing you and\ntaking the gadget wouldn't do any good, that we've covered you. He won't\nbother having anything done to you if he knows that the secret of the\ngadget is out already.\"\n\nHowley's eyes widened behind those spectacles of his. \"You mean they'd\nkill me? I thought Nevada gamblers were honest.\"\n\n\"Oh, they are, they are. But this is a threat to their whole industry.\nIt's more than that, it may destroy them. Some of them might kill to\nkeep that from happening. But you don't have to worry now.\"\n\n\"Thanks. Tell me, do you think we've succeeded?\"\n\n\"In what you set out to do? Certainly. When we mail out those gadgets to\npeople all over the state, the place will be in an uproar. With all the\npublicity this case is getting, it'll _have_ to work. You now have a\ncourt decision on your side, a decision which says that a psionic device\ncan be legally used to influence gambling games.\n\n\"Why, man, they'll _have_ to start investigating! You'll have every\npolitico in the State of Nevada insisting that scientists work on that\nthing. To say nothing of what the syndicate will do.\"\n\n\"All I wanted to do,\" said Howley, \"was force people to take notice of\npsionics. I guess I've done that.\"\n\n\"You certainly have, brother. I wonder what it will come to?\"\n\n\"I wonder, myself, sometimes,\" Howley said.\n\nThat was three and a half years ago. Neither Howley nor I are wondering\nnow. According to the front page of today's _Times_, the first\nspaceship, with a crew of eighty aboard, reached Mars this morning. And,\non page two, there's a small article headlined: ROCKET OBSOLETE, SAY\nSCIENTISTS.\n\nIt sure is.\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's ...Or Your Money Back, by Gordon Randall Garrett\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ...OR YOUR MONEY BACK ***\n\n***** This file should be named 23534.txt or 23534.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/3/5/3/23534/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Bruce Albrecht, Mary Meehan and\nthe Online Distributed Proofreading Team at\nhttp://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
