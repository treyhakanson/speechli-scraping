With the pursuing Federation ship hot on its taloned\nheels, the Morid zeroed on the Telethink signals\u2014fuzzy and\nincomprehensibly alien to its viciously direct mentality, but indicating\nlife and therefore food\u2014and aimed straight for their source.\n\nThe lifeboat crashed headlong in the mangroves fringing Dutchman\u2019s Key,\nperhaps ten miles west of the Oversea Highway and less than two from the\nTelethink station. The Morid emerged in snarling haste, anticipating the\npowerplant\u2019s explosion by a matter of seconds, and vanished like a\nmagenta-furred juggernaut into the moonlit riot of vegetation that\ncrowded back from the mangroved strip of beach. The Morid considered it\na success.\n\nThe lifeboat went up in a cataclysmic roar and flare of bluish light\nthat brought Vann, the Telethink operator on duty, out of his goldberg\nhelmet with a prickly conviction of runaway range missiles. It all but\nblinded and deafened Ellis, his partner, who was cruising with a\nportable Telethink in the station launch through a low-lying maze of\nislands a quarter of a mile from Dutchman\u2019s Key.\n\nTheir joint consternation was lost on the Morid because both at the\nmoment were outside its avid reach. The teeming welter of life on\nDutchman\u2019s Key was not. The Morid headed inland, sensing abundant quarry\nto satisfy the ravening hunger that drove it and, that craving\nsatisfied, to offer ample scope to its joy of killing.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Morid\u2019s escape left Xaxtol, Federation ship\u2019s commander, in a\ndilemma bordering upon the insoluble.\n\nIt would have been bad enough to lose so rare a specimen even on a\nbarren world, but to have one so voracious at large upon one so\nteeming\u2014as the primitive Telethink signals demonstrated\u2014with previously\nunsuspected intelligence was unthinkable.\n\nThis, at the outset, was Xaxtol\u2019s problem:\n\nForbidden by strictest Galactic injunction, he could not make planetfall\nand interfere with a previously unscouted primitive culture.\nContrariwise, neither could civilized ethic condone his abandoning such\nan unsuspecting culture to the bloody mercies of a Morid without every\neffort to correct his blunder.\n\nHanging in stationary orbit in order to keep a fixed relation to the\nMorid\u2019s landing site, the Federation commander debated earnestly with\nhis staff until a sudden quickening of the barbarous Telethink net made\naction imperative.\n\nTwo of the autochthons were isolated on a small island with the Morid.\nUnwarned, they were doomed.\n\nSo he grouped his staff about him\u2014sitting, crouching, coiling or\nhovering, as individual necessity demanded\u2014and as one entity put the\nwhole into rapport with the all-but-meaningless signals that funneled up\nfrom the Telethink station in the Florida Keys.\n\nAnd, in doing so, roused a consternation as great as his own and\ninfinitely more immediate.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe flash brought Vann away from the Telethink console and out of the\nquonset station to stare shakenly across the tangle of mangroved islands\nto the west. Weyman came out a moment later, on the run, when the\nteeth-jarring blast of the explosion woke him. They stood together on\nthe moon-bright sand and Vann relayed in four words the total of his\ninformation.\n\n\u201cIt fell over there,\u201d Vann said.\n\nA pale pinkish cloud of smoke and steam rose and drifted\nphosphorescently toward a noncommittal moon.\n\n\u201cSecond key out,\u201d Weyman said. \u201cThat would be Dutchman\u2019s, where the\nhermit lives.\u201d\n\nVann nodded, drawing minimal reassurance from the fact that there had\nbeen no mushroom. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be atomic.\u201d\n\nThe Gulf breeze was steady out of the west, freighted with its perpetual\nsalt-and-mangrove smell.\n\n\u201cThe Geigers will tell us soon enough,\u201d Weyman said. \u201cNot that it\u2019ll\nhelp us, with Ellis out in the launch.\u201d\n\nThey looked at each other in sudden shock of joint realization.\n\n\u201cThe launch,\u201d Vann said. \u201cEllis is out there with the portable Telethink\nrig. We were working out field-strength ratios for personal equipment\u2014\u201d\n\nThey dived for the quonset together. Vann, smaller and more agile than\nthe deliberate Weyman, reached the Telethink first.\n\n\u201cNothing but the regular standby carrier from Washington,\u201d Vann said.\n\u201cEllis may have been directly under the thing when it struck. He was\nworking toward Dutchman\u2019s Key, hoping for a glimpse of the hermit.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe he wasn\u2019t wearing the Telethink when the blast came,\u201d Weyman\nsaid. Then, with characteristic practicality: \u201cBetter image Washington\nabout this while we\u2019re waiting for Ellis to report in. Can\u2019t use the net\nradio\u2014we\u2019d start a panic.\u201d\n\nVann settled himself at the console.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll try. That is, if I can get across anything beyond the sort of\nsubliminal rot we\u2019ve been trading lately.\u201d\n\nHe signaled for contact and felt the Washington operator\u2019s answering\nsurge of subconscious resentment at being disturbed. With the closing of\nthe net the now-familiar giddiness of partial rapport came on him,\ntogether with the oppressive sense of bodily sharing.\n\nThere was a sudden trickle of saliva in his mouth and he resisted the\ndesire to spit.\n\n\u201cWashington is having a midnight snack,\u201d Vann said. \u201cRotted sardines and\nLimburger, I think.\u201d\n\nHe made correction when the Washington operator radiated indignation.\n\u201cGoose liver and dill pickles, then, but you wouldn\u2019t guess it. Salt\ntastes like brass filings.\u201d\n\nWeyman said shortly, \u201cGet on with it. You can clown later.\u201d\n\nVann visualized the flare of explosion and winced at the panicky\nhammer-and-sickled surmise that came back to him.\n\n\u201cHow would I know?\u201d he said aloud. \u201cWe have a man out\u2014\u201d\n\nHe recalled the inherent limitation of phonetics then and fell back upon\nimagery, picturing Ellis\u2019 launch heading toward an island luridly\nlighted by the blast. For effect he added, on the key\u2019s minuscule beach,\na totally imaginary shack of driftwood, complete with bearded hermit.\n\nHe knew immediately when authority arrived at the other end of the net.\nThere was a mental backwash of conversation that told him his orders\neven before the Washington operator set himself for their relay.\n\n\u201cThey want an eyewitness account from Ellis,\u201d he told Weyman. \u201cAs if\u2014\u201d\n\nEllis broke into the net at that moment, radiating a hazy image\u2014he was\nstill partially blinded from the glare of the blast\u2014of a lowering key\noverhung by a dwindling pall of pinkish smoke. In the foreground of\nlagoon and mangroves stood a stilted shack not unlike the one Vann had\npictured, but without the hermit.\n\nInstead, the rickety elevation of thatched porch was a blot of sable\ndarkness relieved only by a pair of slanted yellow eyes gleaming close\nto the floor.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nClimactically, Xaxtol entered the net then with an impact of total\ninformation that was more than the human psyche, conditioned to\nserialized thinking by years of phonetic communication, could bear.\n\nThe Washington operator screamed and tore off his helmet, requiring\nrestraint until he could compose himself enough to relay his message.\n\nEllis, in his launch, fainted dead away and ran the boat headlong\naground on the beach of Dutchman\u2019s Key.\n\nVann reeled in his chair, teetering between shock and lunacy, until\nWeyman caught him and slid the Telethink from his head. It was minutes\nbefore Vann could speak; when he did, it was with a macabre flippancy\nthat Weyman found more convincing than any dramatics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s come,\u201d Vann said. \u201cThere\u2019s an interstellar ship out there with a\nthousand-odd crew that would give Dali himself nightmares.\u201d\n\nWeyman had to shake him forcibly before he could continue.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re sorry they can\u2019t put down and help us,\u201d Vann said. \u201cGalactic\nregulations, it seems. But they feel they should warn us that they\u2019ve\nlet some sort of bloodthirsty jungle monster\u2014a specimen they were\nfreighting to an interplanetary zoo\u2014escape in a lifeboat. It\u2019s loose\ndown here.\u201d\n\n\u201cDutchman\u2019s Key,\u201d Weyman breathed. \u201cWhat kind of brute could live\nthrough a blast like _that_?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt left the lifeboat before the power plant blew,\u201d Vann said. \u201cThey\u2019re\ntracking its aura now. It\u2019s intelligent to a degree\u2014about on par with\nourselves, I gather\u2014and it\u2019s big. It\u2019s the largest and most vicious life\nform they\u2019ve met in kilo-years of startrading.\u201d\n\nHe frowned over a concept unsuited to words. \u201cLonger than thousands.\nTheir culture goes back so far that the term doesn\u2019t register.\u201d\n\n\u201cEllis,\u201d Weyman said. \u201cTell him to sheer off. Tell him to keep away from\nthat island.\u201d\n\nVann clapped on the Telethink helmet and felt real panic when he found\nthe net vacant except for a near-hysterical Washington operator.\n\n\u201cAliens are off the air,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t feel Ellis.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe he isn\u2019t wearing his Telethink. I\u2019ll try his launch radio.\u201d\n\nHe had the microphone in his hand when Vann said, \u201cThey got the message\nin Washington, and they\u2019re petrified. I asked for a copter to pick up\nEllis\u2014and the hermit, if they can reach them before this _thing_\ndoes\u2014but they\u2019re thinking along different lines. They\u2019re sending a\nsquadron of jet bombers with nonatomic HE to make sure the beast doesn\u2019t\nescape to the mainland and devastate the countryside.\u201d\n\nWeyman said incredulously, \u201cThey\u2019ll blow the key to bits. What about\nEllis and the hermit?\u201d\n\n\u201cEllis is to evacuate him if possible. They\u2019re giving us twenty minutes\nbefore the jets come. After that\u2014\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t have to finish.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt midnight old Charlie Trask was wading knee-deep in the eastside grass\nflats of his private lagoon, methodically netting shrimp that darted to\nthe ooze-clouded area stirred up by his ragged wading shoes. An empty\ngunny sack hung across one shoulder, ready for the coon oysters he would\npick from mangrove roots on his way back to his shack.\n\nIn his dour and antisocial way, Charlie was content. He had nearly\nenough shrimp for boiling and for bait, with the prospect of coon oyster\nstew in the offing. He had tobacco for his pipe and cartridges for his\nsingle-shot .22 rifle and a batch of potent homebrew ready for the\nbottling.\n\nWhat more could a man want?\n\nThe blast and glare of the Morid\u2019s landing on the western fringe of his\nkey jarred Charlie from his mellow mood like a clear-sky thunderbolt.\nThe concussion rattled what teeth remained to him and brought a distant\nsquall from his cat, a scarred and cynical old tom named Max, at the\nshack.\n\n_Damn rockets_, was Charlie\u2019s instant thought. _Fool around till they\nblow us all to hell._\n\nThe rosy phosphorescence drifting up from the mangroves a quarter of a\nmile away colored his resentment with alarm. A blast like that could\nstart a fire, burn across the key and gut his shack.\n\nGrumbling at the interruption of his midnight foray, Charlie crimped the\nlid tight on his shrimp bucket and stalked back along the lagoon toward\nhis shack. The coon oysters would have to wait.\n\nFive minutes later he reached his personal castle, perched on precarious\npiling in a gap hewn from the mangroves. The moon made it, to Charlie, a\nthing of black-and-silver beauty, with Max\u2019s yellow eyes gleaming from\nthe porch floor like wicked, welcoming beacons.\n\nStill muttering, Charlie waded out of the shallow-water ooze and stumped\nin squishing shoes up the ladder to his shack. The shrimp bucket he hung\non a wall peg out of Max\u2019s calculating reach. He found his pipe in the\nkitchen and loaded and lighted it, deliberately because the capacity for\nhaste was not in him. His homebrew crock bubbled seductively and he took\ntime out to raise the grimy toweling that covered it and sniff\nappreciatively.\n\n\u201cReady to cap by the time I come back and get the shrimp graded,\u201d he\ntold Max.\n\nHe changed his dripping brogans for a pair of snake-proof boots and took\ndown his .22 rifle from its pegs, not because he really imagined that\nanyone might have lived through such a blast but because strangers\u2014them\nradio fellows two keys east, for instance\u2014might take it into their heads\nto come prying around.\n\nHe was halfway across the key when the drone of Ellis\u2019 launch entering\nhis lagoon justified his suspicions.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nCharlie\u2019s investigation was soon over.\n\nA dying plume of steam rising from a circle of battered mangroves told\nhim that no danger of fire impended, and he turned back in relief. It\ndid not occur to him that the pilot of his hypothetical rocket might be\nlying desperately injured in the shallow water, at the mercy of sharks\nand crocodiles. If it had, he would not have moved to help. Any fool who\ngot himself into such a spot, in Charlie\u2019s rude philosophy, could get\nhimself out.\n\nThe drone of the launch\u2019s engine was loud when he reached his shack. The\nboat, handled by a pilot grotesque in what Charlie took at first for a\ndiver\u2019s helmet, was heading directly for his landing at an unsafe speed.\n\n\u201cServe him right if he shoals on a oyster bed and rips his bottom,\u201d\nCharlie said.\n\nAs if on cue, the boat swerved sharply. Its pilot came half erect, arms\nflung wide in a convulsive gesture. The engine roared wildly; the boat\nheeled, slamming its occupant against the right gunwale, and blasted\nstraight for Charlie\u2019s shack.\n\nMiraculously, it missed the shack\u2019s piling and lunged half its length\nupon the sand. The engine-roar died instantly. The pilot was thrown\nheadlong overside, goldberg helmet flying off in mid-arc, to lie stunned\nat the foot of Charlie\u2019s ladder.\n\nCallously, Charlie stepped over Ellis\u2019 twitching form and stumped up the\nladder to his shack. Max, who had taken to the porch rafters at the\ncrash of the launch, came meowing gingerly down to meet him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Charlie told him. \u201cJust some fool that don\u2019t know how\nto handle a boat.\u201d\n\nHe leaned his rifle against the wall and brought a split-bamboo chair\nfrom the kitchen. He was not too late; the bucket, when he took it from\nits peg, still slithered satisfactorily with live shrimp.\n\nThe squawking of the launch radio roused Ellis. He groaned and sat up,\ndazed and disoriented by the combined shock of Xaxtol\u2019s telepathic\nbombshell and his own rude landing, just as Weyman gave up his attempt\nat radio contact. In the silence that fell, Ellis would have fainted\nagain except for the chilling knowledge that he was unarmed and afoot on\nthe same key with a man-eating alien monster that might make its\nappearance at any moment.\n\nHe collected wits and breath to stave off the black pall of shock that\nstill threatened.\n\n\u201cCome down from there and help me push the launch off,\u201d he called up to\nCharlie Trask. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get off this key. Fast!\u201d\n\nCharlie separated a menu-sized shrimp from his bucket.\n\n\u201cYou grounded her,\u201d he said sourly. \u201cPush her off yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen,\u201d Ellis said desperately. \u201cThat blast was a ship from space,\nfrom another star. A wild animal escaped from it, something worse than\nyou ever dreamed of. We\u2019ve got to get out of here before it finds us.\u201d\n\nCharlie grunted and chose another shrimp.\n\nThe Morid, as Xaxtol had pictured it, rose vividly in Ellis\u2019 memory,\nfanged and shaggy and insatiably voracious, a magenta-furred ursine\nembodiment of blood-lust made the worst by its near-human intelligence.\n\nHe described it in dogged haste, his eyes frozen to the tangle of inland\nunderbrush behind the shack.\n\n\u201cNo such varmint in these kays,\u201d old Charlie said.\n\nThe launch radio blared again in Weyman\u2019s voice, speaking urgently of\njet bombers and deadlines. A glance at his watch brought Ellis up from\nthe sand in galvanic resolution.\n\n\u201cIn twelve minutes,\u201d he said grimly, \u201ca squadron of planes will pinpoint\nthis key and blast it out of the water. I\u2019m not going to be eaten alive\nor blown to bits arguing with you. If I can\u2019t push the launch off alone,\nI\u2019ll swim.\u201d\n\nHe scooped up his fallen Telethink helmet and ran for the launch. At the\nfourth step his foot caught in the iron-hard stump of a mangrove root\nthat had been chopped off inches above the sand and he fell heavily.\nPain blinded him; his right ankle lanced with fire and went numb.\n\nHe fought to rise and fell again when the ankle collapsed under him.\n\n\u201c_Hell_,\u201d he said, just before blackness claimed him for the second\ntime. \u201cI\u2019ve broken my leg!\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis twelve minutes had dwindled to seven when Ellis roused. He tried to\nstand, his twisted ankle momentarily forgotten, and gave it up when the\nmangroves spun dizzily before his eyes. He couldn\u2019t afford to pass out\nagain.\n\nHe made one last-ditch bid for help.\n\n\u201cMy leg\u2019s broken,\u201d he yelled up at old Charlie Trask. \u201cGet down here and\nlend a hand!\u201d\n\nCharlie glowered and said nothing.\n\nMax bounded down the ladder, tail stiffly erect and scarred ears cocked\nat the underbrush in baleful curiosity.\n\n\u201cThe thing is coming this way,\u201d Ellis called. \u201cYour cat scents it. Will\nyou let us all be killed?\u201d\n\nCharlie Trask graded another shrimp.\n\nSwearing bitterly, Ellis caught up his Telethink helmet and slid it over\nhis head. He found the net in a welter of confusion. Washington demanded\nfurther information; Vann, at the station, was calling him frantically.\nHis own scramble for help-images only added to the mental babel.\n\nOn the Federation ship, confusion was nearly as rampant.\n\nXaxtol\u2019s dilemma still held: he could not make planetfall\u2014time was too\nshort for aid now, in any case\u2014but neither could he, with clear Galactic\nconscience, desert the harried primitives below while hope remained.\n\nEllis\u2019 predicament forced Xaxtol to decision; he could only follow the\nMorid\u2019s aura and relay its progress.\n\nIt could not be helped that the relayed image was blurred of definition\nand weirdly askew; the Morid\u2019s visual and auditory range differed so\nsharply from either human or Galactic that even over the ship\u2019s\nwonderfully selective telecommunicator little of the Morid\u2019s immediate\nsurroundings came through clearly. Its aura arrived with a burning\nintensity that turned Xaxtol and his group faint with empathetic horror,\nbut the fact that the Morid had just made its first kill obliterated all\ndetail for the moment beyond a shocking welter of blood and torn flesh.\n\nEllis fared a little better under the second telepathic blast than under\nthe first\u2014he managed to snatch off his Telethink helmet just in time.\n\n\u201cThe thing just killed something out there,\u201d he yelled at Charlie Trask.\n\u201cIt\u2019s coming this way. Are you going to sit there and\u2014\u201d\n\nCharlie graded his last edible shrimp, took up his bucket and went\ninside. The leisurely clinking of homebrew bottles drifted after him,\nclear and musical on the still, hot air.\n\nEllis looked at his watch and considered prayer. He had three minutes\nleft.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen the Morid came, Ellis was sitting dumbly on the sand, nursing his\nbroken ankle and considering with a shock-detached part of his mind a\nfragmentary line of some long-forgotten schooldays poem.\n\n_What rough beast is this_ ... the rest eluded him.\n\nThe underbrush beyond the shack rustled and the Morid\u2019s ravening image\nsprang to Ellis\u2019 mind with a clarity that shook his three\nnet-participants to the core\u2014one of them past endurance.\n\nVann, in the station, said \u201c_Dear God_,\u201d and braced himself for the end.\nIn Washington, the operator fainted and had to be dragged from his\nconsole.\n\nAboard the Federation ship, Xaxtol radiated a shaken \u201cEnough!\u201d and\ntentacled a stud that sent his craft flashing on its way through\nsubspace.\n\nAt Charlie Trask\u2019s shack, Max bounded across the clearing and into the\nbrush. There followed a riot of squalling and screaming that brought\nCharlie out of his shack on the run. Ellis sat numbly, beyond shock,\nwaiting for the worst.\n\nUnaccountably, the worst was delayed.\n\nCharlie came back, clutching a protesting Max by the scruff of the neck,\nand threw down something at Ellis\u2019 feet. Something small and limp and\nmagenta-furred, smeared with greenish blood and very, very dead.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s your varmint,\u201d said Charlie.\n\nWith one minute remaining before the promised bombers roared over,\nEllis, with a frozen clarity he had not dreamed he possessed, radiated a\nfinal message before he fainted again.\n\n\u201cCall off the jets,\u201d he said, in effect. \u201cIt\u2019s over. The beast is dead.\nThe hermit\u2019s cat killed it.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nAn hour later at the station, his ankle bandaged and his third cup of\ncoffee in hand, Ellis could review it all with some coherence.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t consider the business of relative size,\u201d he said. \u201cNeither\ndid our Galactic friends. Apparently they\u2019re small, and so are all the\nspecies they\u2019ve met with before. Maybe we\u2019re something unique in the\nuniverse, after all. And maybe it\u2019s a good thing they didn\u2019t land and\nlearn how unique.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt figures,\u201d Weyman said. \u201cWashington let it out on the air that DF\nstations made a fix on the spaceship before it jumped off. It measured\nonly twenty-two feet.\u201d\n\nVann said wonderingly, \u201cAnd there were hundreds of them aboard.\nGentlemen, we are Brobdingnagians in a universe of Lilliputians.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been trying,\u201d Ellis said irrelevantly, \u201cto recall a poem I read\nonce in school. I\u2019ve forgotten the author and all the verse but one\nline. It goes\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c_What rough beast is this_,\u201d Vann quoted. \u201cYou were thinking about it\nhard enough when the debacle in the brush took place. The image you\nradiated was rough enough\u2014it shocked the pants off us.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd off the Galactics,\u201d Weyman said. \u201cThe shoe is on the other foot\nnow, I think.\u201d\n\nHe went to the quonset door and looked out and up, listening. \u201cJets. The\nWashington brass on its way to cross-examine us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe other foot?\u201d Vann said. \u201cDon\u2019t be cryptic, man.

It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org\n\n\n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\nlocations.

Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
