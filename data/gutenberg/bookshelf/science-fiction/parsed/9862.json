As I look back now, in the light of my present\nknowledge, I better comprehend the docile humility and carefully\nnurtured ignorance of this man. In his class rooms he used as a text a\ndescription of German life, taken from the captured submarine. From this\nbook he had secured his own conception of a civilization of which he\nreally knew practically nothing. I recall how we used to ask Herr\nMeineke if he had actually seen those strange things of which he taught\nus. To this he always made answer, \"The book is official, man's\nobservation errs.\"\n\n~2~\n\n\"He can talk it,\" said my playmates who attended the public schools\nwhere all teaching of the language of the outcast nation was prohibited.\nThey invariably elected me to be \"the Germans,\" and locked me up in the\nold garage while they rained a stock of sun-dried clay bombs upon the\nroof and then came with a rush to \"batter down the walls of Berlin\" by\nbreaking in the door, while I, muttering strange guttural oaths, would\nbe led forth to be \"exterminated.\"\n\nOn rainy days I would sometimes take my favoured playmates into my\nuncle's library where five great maps hung in ordered sequence on the\npanelled wall.\n\nThe first map was labelled \"The Age of Nations--1914,\" and showed the\nblack spot of Germany, like in size to many of the surrounding\ncountries, the names of which one recited in the history class.\n\nThe second map--\"Germany's Maximum Expansion of the First World\nWar--1918\"--showed the black area trebled in size, crowding into the\npale gold of France, thrusting a hungry arm across the Hellespont\ntowards Bagdad, and, from the Balkans to the Baltic, blotting out all\nelse save the flaming red of Bolshevist Russia, which spread over the\nEastern half of Europe like a pool of fresh spilled blood.\n\nThird came \"The Age of the League of Nations, 1919--1983,\" with the gold\nof democracy battling with the spreading red of socialism, for the black\nof autocracy had erstwhile vanished.\n\nThe fourth map was the most fascinating and terrible. Again the black of\nautocracy appeared, obliterating the red of the Brotherhood of Man,\nspreading across half of Eurasia and thrusting a broad black shadow to\nthe Yellow Sea and a lesser one to the Persian Gulf. This map was\nlabelled \"Maximum German Expansion of the Second World War, 1988,\" and\nlines of dotted white retreated in concentric waves till the line\nof 2041.\n\nThis same year was the first date of the fifth map, which was labelled\n\"A Century of the World State,\" and here, as all the sea was blue, so\nall the land was gold, save one black blot that might have been made by\na single spattered drop of ink, for it was no bigger than the Irish\nIsland. The persistence of this remaining black on the map of the world\ntroubled my boyish mind, as it has troubled three generations of the\nUnited World, and strive as I might, I could not comprehend why the\ngreat blackness of the fourth map had been erased and this small blot\nalone remained.\n\n~3~\n\nWhen I returned from school for my vacation, after I had my first year\nof physical science, I sought out my uncle in his laboratory and asked\nhim to explain the mystery of the little black island standing adamant\nin the golden sea of all the world.\n\n\"That spot,\" said my uncle, \"would have been erased in two more years if\na Leipzig professor had not discovered The Ray. Yet we do not know his\nname nor how he made his discovery.\"\n\n\"But just what is The Ray?\" I asked.\n\n\"We do not know that either, nor how it is made. We only know that it\ndestroys the oxygen carrying power of living blood. If it were an\nemanation from a substance like radium, they could have fired it in\nprojectiles and so conquered the earth. If it were ether waves like\nelectricity, we should have been able to have insulated against it, or\nthey should have been able to project it farther and destroy our\naircraft, but The Ray is not destructive beyond two thousand metres in\nthe air and hardly that far in the earth.\"\n\n\"Then why do we not fly over and land an army and great guns and batter\ndown the walls of Berlin and he done with it?\"\n\n\"That, as you know if you studied your history, has been tried many\ntimes and always with disaster. The bomb-torn soil of that black land is\nspeckled white with the bones of World armies who were sent on landing\ninvasions before you or I was born. But it was only heroic folly, one\ngun popping out of a tunnel mouth can slay a thousand men. To pursue the\ngunners into their catacombs meant to be gassed; and sometimes our\nforces were left to land in peace and set up their batteries to fire\nagainst Berlin, but the Germans would place Ray generators in the ground\nbeneath them and slay our forces in an hour, as the Angel of Jehovah\nwithered the hosts of the Assyrians.\"\n\n\"But why,\" I persisted, \"do we not tunnel under the Ray generators and\ndig our way to Berlin and blow it up?\"\n\nMy uncle smiled indulgently. \"And that has been tried too, but they can\nhear our borings with microphones and cut us off, just as we cut them\noff when they try to tunnel out and place new generators. It is too\nslow, too difficult, either way; the line has wavered a little with the\nyears but to no practical avail; the war in our day has become merely a\nwatching game, we to keep the Germans from coming out, they to keep us\nfrom penetrating within gunshot of Berlin; but to gain a mile of\nworthless territory either way means too great a human waste to be worth\nthe price. Things must go on as they are till the Germans tire of their\nsunless imprisonment or till they exhaust some essential element in\ntheir soil. But wars such as you read of in your history, will never\nhappen again. The Germans cannot fight the world in the air, nor in the\nsea, nor on the surface of the earth; and we cannot fight the Germans in\nthe ground; so the war has become a fixed state of standing guard; the\nhope of victory, the fear of defeat have vanished; the romance of war\nis dead.\"\n\n\"But why, then,\" I asked, \"does the World Patrol continue to bomb the\nroof of Berlin?\"\n\n\"Politics,\" replied my uncle, \"military politics, just futile display of\npyrotechnics to amuse the populace and give heroically inclined young\nmen a chance to strut in uniforms--but after the election this fall such\nfolly will cease.\"\n\n~4~\n\nMy uncle had predicted correctly, for by the time I again came home on\nmy vacation, the newly elected Pacifist Council had reduced the aerial\nactivities to mere watchful patroling over the land of the enemy. Then\ncame the report of an attempt to launch an airplane from the roof of\nBerlin. The people, in dire panic lest Ray generators were being carried\nout by German aircraft, had clamoured for the recall of the Pacifist\nCouncil, and the bombardment of Berlin was resumed.\n\nDuring the lull of the bombing activities my uncle, who stood high with\nthe Pacifist Administration, had obtained permission to fly over Europe,\nand I, most fortunate of boys, accompanied him. The plane in which we\ntravelled bore the emblem of the World Patrol. On a cloudless day we\nsailed over the pock-marked desert that had once been Germany and came\nwithin field-glass range of Berlin itself. On the wasted, bomb-torn land\nlay the great grey disc--the city of mystery. Three hundred metres high\nthey said it stood, but so vast was its extent that it seemed as flat\nand thin as a pancake on a griddle.\n\n\"More people live in that mass of concrete,\" said my uncle, \"than in the\nwhole of America west of the Rocky Mountains.\" His statement, I have\nsince learned, fell short of half the truth, but then it seemed\nappalling. I fancied the city a giant anthill, and searched with my\nglass as if I expected to see the ants swarming out. But no sign of life\nwas visible upon the monotonous surface of the sand-blanketed roof, and\nhigh above the range of naked vision hung the hawk-like watchers of the\nWorld Patrol.\n\nThe lure of unravelled secrets, the ambition for discovery and\nexploration stirred my boyish veins. Yes, I would know more of the\nstrange race, the unknown life that surged beneath that grey blanket of\nmystery. But how? For over a century millions of men had felt that same\nlonging to know. Aviators, landing by accident or intent within the\nlines, had either returned with nothing to report, or they had not\nreturned. Daring journalists, with baskets of carrier pigeons, had on\nfoggy nights dropped by parachute to the roof of the city; but neither\nthey nor the birds had brought back a single word of what lay beneath\nthe armed and armoured roof.\n\nMy own resolution was but a boy's dream and I returned to Chicago to\ntake up my chemical studies.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nI EXPLORE THE POTASH MINES OF STASSFURT\nAND FIND A DIARY IN A DEAD MAN'S POCKET\n\n\n~1~\n\nWhen I was twenty-four years old, my uncle was killed in a laboratory\nexplosion. He had been a scientist of renown and a chemical inventor who\nhad devoted his life to the unravelling of the secrets of the synthetic\nfoods of Germany. For some years I had been his trusted assistant. In\nour Chicago laboratory were carefully preserved food samples that had\nbeen taken from the captured submarines in years gone by; and what to me\nwas even more fascinating, a collection of German books of like origin,\nwhich I had read with avidity. With the exception of those relating to\nsubmarine navigation, I found them stupidly childish and decided that\nthey had been prepared to hide the truth and not reveal it.\n\nMy uncle had bequeathed me both his work and his fortune, but despairing\nof my ability worthily to continue his own brilliant researches on\nsynthetic food, I turned my attention to the potash problem, in which I\nhad long been interested. My reading of early chemical works had given\nme a particular interest in the reclamation of the abandoned potash\nmines of Stassfurt. These mines, as any student of chemical history will\nknow, were one of the richest properties of the old German state in the\ndays before the endless war began and Germany became isolated from the\nrest of the world. The mines were captured by the World in the year\n2020, and were profitably operated for a couple of decades. Meanwhile\nthe German lines were forced many miles to the rear before the\nimpregnable barrier of the Ray had halted the progress of the\nWorld Armies.\n\nA few years after the coming of the Ray defences, occurred what history\nrecords as \"The Tragedy of the Mines.\" Six thousand workmen went down\ninto the potash mines of Stassfurt one morning and never came up again.\nThe miners' families in the neighbouring villages died like weevils in\nfumigated grain. The region became a valley of pestilence and death, and\nall life withered for miles around. Numerous governmental projects were\nlaunched for the recovery of the potash mines but all failed, and for\none hundred and eleven years no man had penetrated those\naccursed shafts.\n\nKnowing these facts, I wasted no time in soliciting government aid for\nmy project, but was content to secure a permit to attempt the recovery\nwith private funds, with which my uncle's fortune supplied me in\nabundance.\n\nIn April, 2151, I set up my laboratory on the edge of the area of death.\nI had never accepted the orthodox view as to the composition of the gas\nthat issued from the Stassfurt mines. In a few months I was gratified to\nfind my doubts confirmed. A short time after this I made a more\nunexpected and astonishing discovery. I found that this complex and\nhitherto misunderstood gas could, under the influence of certain\nhigh-frequency electrical discharges, be made to combine with explosive\nviolence with the nitrogen of the atmosphere, leaving only a harmless\nresidue. We wired the surrounding region for the electrical discharge\nand, with a vast explosion of weird purple flame, cleared the whole area\nof the century-old curse. Our laboratory was destroyed by the explosion.\nIt was rebuilt nearer the mine shafts from which the gas still slowly\nissued. Again we set up our electrical machinery and dropped our cables\ninto the shafts, this time clearing the air of the mines.\n\nA hasty exploration revealed the fact that but a single shaft had\nremained intact. A third time we prepared our electrical machinery. We\nlet down a cable and succeeded in getting but a faint reaction at the\nbottom of the shaft. After several repeated clearings we risked descent.\n\nUpon arrival at the bottom we were surprised to find it free from water,\nsave for a trickling stream. The second thing we discovered was a pile\nof huddled skeletons of the workmen who had perished over a century\nprevious. But our third and most important discovery was a boring from\nwhich the poisonous gas was slowly issuing. It took but a few hours to\nprovide an apparatus to fire this gas as fast as it issued, and the\npotash mines of Stassfurt were regained for the world.\n\nMy associates were for beginning mining operations at once, but I had\nbeen granted a twenty years' franchise on the output of these mines, and\nI was in no such haste. The boring from which this poisonous vapour\nissued was clearly man-made; moreover I alone knew the formula of that\ngas and had convinced myself once for all as to its man-made origin. I\nsent for microphones and with their aid speedily detected the sound of\nmachinery in other workings beneath.\n\nIt is easy now to see that I erred in risking my own life as I did\nwithout the precaution of confiding the secret of my discovery to\nothers. But those were days of feverish excitement. Impulsively I\ndecided to make the first attack on the Germans as a private enterprise\nand then call for military aid. I had my own equipment of poisonous\nbombs and my sapping and mining experts determined that the German\nworkings were but eighty metres beneath us. Hastily, among the crumbling\nskeletons, we set up our electrical boring machinery and began sinking a\none-metre shaft towards the nearest sound.\n\nAfter twenty hours of boring, the drill head suddenly came off and\nrattled down into a cavern. We saw a light and heard guttural shouting\nbelow and the cracking of a gun as a few bullets spattered against the\nroof of our chamber. We heaved down our gas bombs and covered over our\nshaft. Within a few hours the light below went out and our microphones\nfailed to detect any sound from the rocks beneath us. It was then\nperhaps that I should have called for military aid, but the uncanny\nsilence of the lower workings proved too much for my eager curiosity. We\nwaited two days and still there was no evidence of life below. I knew\nthere had been ample time for the gas from our bombs to have been\ndissipated, as it was decomposed by contact with moisture. A light was\nlowered, but this brought forth no response.\n\nI now called for a volunteer to descend the shaft. None was forthcoming\nfrom among my men, and against their protest I insisted on being lowered\ninto the shaft. When I was a few metres from the bottom the cable parted\nand I fell and lay stunned on the floor below.\n\n~2~\n\nWhen I recovered consciousness the light had gone out. There was no\nsound about me. I shouted up the shaft above and could get no answer.\nThe chamber in which I lay was many times my height and I could make\nnothing out in the dark hole above. For some hours I scarcely stirred\nand feared to burn my pocket flash both because it might reveal my\npresence to lurking enemies and because I wished to conserve my battery\nagainst graver need.\n\nBut no rescue came from my men above. Only recently, after the lapse of\nyears, did I learn the cause of their deserting me. As I lay stunned\nfrom my fall, my men, unable to get answer to their shoutings, had given\nme up for dead. Meanwhile the apparatus which caused the destruction of\nthe German gas had gone wrong. My associates, unable to fix it, had fled\nfrom the mine and abandoned the enterprise.\n\nAfter some hours of waiting I stirred about and found means to erect a\nrough scaffold and reach the mouth of the shaft above me. I attempted to\nclimb, but, unable to get a hold on the smooth wet rock, I gave up\nexhausted and despairing. Entombed in the depths of the earth, I was\neither a prisoner of the German potash miners, if any remained alive, or\na prisoner of the earth itself, with dead men for company.\n\nCollecting my courage I set about to explore my surroundings. I found\nsome mining machinery evidently damaged by the explosion of our gas\nbombs. There was no evidence of men about, living or dead. Stealthily I\nset out along the little railway track that ran through a passage down a\nsteep incline. As I progressed I felt the air rapidly becoming colder.\nPresently I stumbled upon the first victim of our gas bombs, fallen\nheadlong as he was fleeing. I hurried on. The air seemed to be blowing\nin my face and the cold was becoming intense. This puzzled me for at\nthis depth the temperature should have been above that on the surface of\nthe earth.\n\nAfter a hundred metres or so of going I came into a larger chamber. It\nwas intensely cold. From out another branching passage-way I could hear\na sizzling sound as of steam escaping. I started to turn into this\npassage but was met with such a blast of cold air that I dared not face\nit for fear of being frozen. Stamping my feet, which were fast becoming\nnumb, I made the rounds of the chamber, and examined the dead miners\nthat were tumbled about. The bodies were frozen.\n\nOne side of this chamber was partitioned off with some sort of metal\nwall. The door stood blown open. It felt a little warmer in here and I\nentered and closed the door. Exploring the room with my dim light I\nfound one side of it filled with a row of bunks--in each bunk a corpse.\nAlong the other side of the room was a table with eating utensils and\nback of this were shelves with food packages.\n\nI was in danger of freezing to death and, tumbling several bodies out of\nthe bunks, I took the mattresses and built of them a clumsy enclosure\nand installed in their midst a battery heater which I found. In this\nfashion I managed to get fairly warm again. After some hours of huddling\nI observed that the temperature had moderated.\n\nMy fear of freezing abated, I made another survey of my surroundings and\ndiscovered something that had escaped my first attention. In the far end\nof the room was a desk, and seated before it with his head fallen\nforward on his arms was the form of a man. The miners had all been\ndressed in a coarse artificial leather, but this man was dressed in a\nwoven fabric of cellulose silk.\n\nThe body was frozen. As I tumbled it stiffly back it fell from the chair\nexposing a ghastly face. I drew away in a creepy horror, for as I looked\nat the face of the corpse I suffered a sort of waking nightmare in which\nI imagined that I was gazing at my own dead countenance.\n\nI concluded that my normal mind was slipping out of gear and proceeded\nto back off and avail myself of a tube of stimulant which I carried in\nmy pocket.\n\nThis revived me somewhat, but again, when I tried to look upon the\nfrozen face, the conviction returned that I was looking at my own\ndead self.\n\nI glanced at my watch and figured out that I had been in the German mine\nfor thirty hours and had not tasted food or drink for nearly forty\nhours. Clearly I had to get myself in shape to escape hallucinations. I\nwent back to the shelves and proceeded to look for food and drink.\nHappily, due to my work in my uncle's laboratory, these synthetic foods\nwere not wholly strange to me. I drank copiously of a non-alcoholic\nchemical liquor and warmed on the heater and partook of some nitrogenous\nand some starchy porridges. It was an uncanny dining place, but hunger\nsoon conquers mere emotion, and I made out a meal. Then once more I\nfaced the task of confronting this dead likeness of myself.\n\nThis time I was clear-headed enough. I even went to the miners' lavatory\nand, jerking down the metal mirror, scrutinized my own reflection and\nreassured myself of the closeness of the resemblance. My purpose framed\nin my mind as I did this. Clearly I was in German quarters and was\nlikely to remain there. Sooner or later there must be a rescuing party.\n\nWithout further ado, I set about changing my clothing for that of the\nGerman. The fit of the dead man's clothes further emphasized the closeness\nof the physical likeness. I recalled my excellent command of the German\nlanguage and began to wonder what manner of man I was supposed to be in\nthis assumed personality. But my most urgent task was speedily to make\nway with the incriminating corpse. With the aid of the brighter\nflashlight which I found in my new pockets, I set out to find a place to\nhide the body.\n\nThe cold that had so frightened me had now given way to almost normal\ntemperature. There was no longer the sound of sizzling steam from the\nunexplored passage-way. I followed this and presently came upon another\nchamber filled with machinery. In one corner a huge engine, covered with\nfrost, gave off a chill greeting. On the floor was a steaming puddle of\nliquid, but the breath of this steam cut like a blizzard. At once I\nguessed it. This was a liquid air engine. The dead engineer in the\ncorner helped reveal the story. With his death from the penetrating gas,\nsomething had gone wrong with the engine. The turbine head had blown\noff, and the conveying pipe of liquid air had poured forth the icy blast\nthat had so nearly frozen me along with the corpses of the Germans. But\nnow the flow of liquid had ceased, and the last remnants were\nevaporating from the floor. Evidently the supply pipe had been shut off\nfurther back on the line, and I had little time to lose for rescuers\nwere probably on the way.\n\nAlong one of the corridors running from the engine room I found an open\nwater drain half choked with melting ice. Following this I came upon a\ngrating where the water disappeared. I jerked up the grating and dropped\na piece of ice down the well-like shaft. I hastily returned and dragged\nforth the corpse of my double and with it everything I had myself\nbrought into the mine. Straightening out the stiffened body I plunged it\nhead foremost into the opening. The sound of a splash echoed within the\ndismal depths.\n\nI now hastened back to the chamber into which I had first fallen and\ndestroyed the scaffolding I had erected there. Returning to the desk\nwhere I had found the man whose clothing I wore, I sat down and\nproceeded to search my abundantly filled pockets. From one of them I\npulled out a bulky notebook and a number of loose papers. The freshest\nof these was an official order from the Imperial Office of Chemical\nEngineers. The order ran as follows:\n\n  Capt. Karl Armstadt\n      Laboratory 186, E. 58.\n\n  Report is received at this office of the sound of sapping\n  operations in potash mine D5. Go at once and verify the same\n  and report of condition of gas generators and make analyses\n  of output of the same.\n\nEvidently I was Karl Armstadt and very happily a chemical engineer by\nprofession. My task of impersonation so far looked feasible--I could\ntalk chemical engineering.\n\nThe next paper I proceeded to examine was an identification folder done\nup in oiled fabric. Thanks to German thoroughness it was amusingly\ncomplete. On the first page appeared what I soon discovered to be __\npedigree for four generations back. The printed form on which all this\nwas minutely filled out made very clear statements from which I\ndetermined that my father and mother were both dead.\n\nI, Karl Armstadt, twenty-seven years of age, was the fourteenth child of\nmy mother and was born when she was forty-two years of age. According to\nthe record I was the ninety-seventh child of my father and born when he\nwas fifty-four. As I read this I thought there was something here that I\nmisunderstood, although subsequent discoveries made it plausible enough.\nThere was no further record of my plentiful fraternity, but I took heart\nthat the mere fact of their numerical abundance would make unlikely any\ngreat show of brotherly interest, a presumption which proved\nquite correct.\n\nOn the second page of this folder I read the number and location of my\nliving quarters, the sources from which my meals and clothing were\nissued, as well as the sizes and qualities of my garments and numerous\nother references to various details of living, all of which seemed\npainstakingly ridiculous at the time.\n\nI put this elaborate identification paper back into its receptacle and\nopened the notebook. It proved to be a diary kept likewise in thorough\nGerman fashion. I turned to the last pages and perused them hastily.\n\nThe notes in Armstadt's diary were concerned almost wholly with his\nchemical investigations. All this I saw might be useful to me later but\nwhat I needed more immediately was information as to his personal life.\nI scanned back hastily through the pages for a time without finding any\nsuch revelations. Then I discovered this entry made some months\npreviously:\n\n\"I cannot think of chemistry tonight, for the vision of Katrina dances\nbefore me as in a dream. It must be a strange mixture of blood-lines\nthat could produce such wondrous beauty. In no other woman have I seen\nsuch a blackness of hair and eyes combined with such a whiteness of\nskin. I suppose I should not have danced with her--now I see all my\nresolutions shattered. But I think it was most of all the blackness of\nher eyes. Well, what care, we live but once!\"\n\nI read and re-read this entry and searched feverishly in Armstadt's\ndiary for further evidence of a personal life. But I only found tedious\nnotes on his chemical theories. Perhaps this single reference to a woman\nwas but a passing fancy of a man otherwise engrossed in his science. But\nif rescuers came and I succeeded in passing for the German chemist the\npresence of a woman in my new r\u00f4le of life would surely undo all my\neffort. If no personal acquaintance of the dead man came with the\nrescuing party I saw no reason why I could not for the time pass\nsuccessfully as Armstadt. I should at least make the effort and I\nreasoned I could best do this by playing the malingerer and appearing\nmentally incompetent. Such a ruse, I reasoned, would give me opportunity\nto hear much and say little, and perhaps so get my bearings in the new\nr\u00f4le that I could continue it successfully.\n\nThen, as I was about to return the notebook to my pocket, my hopes sank\nas I found this brief entry which I had at first scanning overlooked:\n\n\"It is twenty days now since Katrina and I have been united. She does\nnot interfere with my work as much as I feared. She even lets me talk\nchemistry to her, though I am sure she understands not one word of what\nI tell her. I think I have made a good selection and it is surely a\npermanent one. Therefore I must work harder than ever or I shall not\nget on.\"\n\nThis alarmed me. Yet, if Armstadt had married he made very little fuss\nabout it. Evidently it concerned him chiefly in relation to his work.\nBut whoever and whatever Katrina was, it was clear that her presence\nwould be disastrous to my plans of assuming his place in the\nGerman world.\n\nPondering over the ultimate difficulty of my situation, but with a\ngrowing faith in the plan I had evolved for avoiding immediate\nexplanations, I fell into a long-postponed sleep. The last thing I\nremember was tumbling from my chair and sprawling out upon the floor\nwhere I managed to snap out my light before the much needed sleep quite\novercame me.\n\n~3~\n\nI was awakened by voices, and opened my eyes to find the place brightly\nlighted. I closed them again quickly as some one approached and prodded\nme with the toe of his boot.\n\n\"Here is a man alive,\" said a voice above me.\n\n\"He is Captain Armstadt, the chemist,\" said another voice, approaching;\n\"this is good. We have special orders to search for him.\"\n\nThe newcomer bent over and felt my heart. I was quite aware that it was\nfunctioning normally. He shook me and called me by name. After repeated\nshakings I opened my eyes and stared at him blankly, but I said nothing.\nPresently he left me and returned with a stretcher. I lay inertly as I\nwas placed thereon and borne out of the chamber. Other stretcher-bearers\nwere walking ahead. We passed through the engine room where mechanics\nwere at work on the damaged liquid air engine. My stretcher was placed\non a little car which moved swiftly along the tunnel.\n\nWe came into a large subterranean station and I was removed and brought\nbefore a bevy of white garbed physicians. They looked at my\nidentification folder and then examined me. Through it all I lay limp\nand as near lifeless as I could simulate, and they succeeded in getting\nno speech out of me. The final orders were to forward me post haste to\nthe Imperial Hospital for Complex Gas Cases.\n\nAfter an eventless journey of many hours I was again unloaded and\ntransferred to an elevator. For several hundred metres we sped upward\nthrough a shaft, while about us whistled a blast of cold, crisp air. At\nlast the elevator stopped and I was carried out to an ambulance that\nstood waiting in a brilliantly lighted passage arched over with grey\nconcrete. I was no longer beneath the surface of the earth but was\nsomewhere in the massive concrete structure of the City of Berlin.\n\nAfter a short journey our ambulance stopped and attendants came out and\ncarried my litter through an open doorway and down a long hall into the\nspacious ward of a hospital.\n\nFrom half closed eyes I glanced about apprehensively for a black-haired\nwoman. With a sigh of relief I saw there were only doctors and male\nattendants in the room. They treated me most professionally and gave no\nsign that they suspected I was other than Capt. Karl Armstadt, which\nfact my papers so eloquently testified. The conclusion of their\nexamination was voiced in my presence. \"Physically he is normal,\" said\nthe head physician, \"but his mind seems in a stupor. There is no remedy,\nas the nature of the gas is unknown. All that can be done is to await\nthe wearing off of the effect.\"\n\nI was then left alone for some hours and my appetite was troubling me.\nAt last an attendant approached with some savoury soup; he propped me up\nand proceeded to feed me with a spoon.\n\nI made out from the conversation about me that the other patients were\nofficers from the underground fighting forces. An atmosphere of military\ndiscipline pervaded the hospital and I felt reassured in the conclusion\nthat all visiting was forbidden.\n\nYet my thoughts turned repeatedly to the black-eyed Katrina of\nArmstadt's diary. No doubt she had been informed of the rescue and was\nwaiting in grief and anxiety to see him. So both she and I were awaiting\na tragic moment--she to learn that her husband or lover was dead, I for\nthe inevitable tearing off of my protecting disguise.\n\nAfter some days the head physician came to my cot and questioned me. I\ngazed at him and knit my brows as if struggling to think.\n\n\"You were gassed in the mine,\" he kept repeating, \"can you remember?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I ventured, \"I went to the mine, there was the sound of boring\noverhead. I set men to watch; I was at the desk, I heard shouting, after\nthat I cannot remember.\"\n\n\"They were all dead but you,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"All dead,\" I repeated. I liked the sound of this and so kept on\nmumbling \"All dead, all dead.\"\n\n~4~\n\nMy plan was working nicely. But I realized I could not keep up this r\u00f4le\nfor ever. Nor did I wish to, for the idleness and suspense were\nintolerable and I knew that I would rather face whatever problems my\nrecovery involved than to continue in this monotonous and meaningless\nexistence. So I convalesced by degrees and got about the hospital, and\nwas permitted to wait on myself. But I cultivated a slowness and brevity\nof speech.\n\nOne day as I sat reading the attendant announced, \"A visitor to see you,\nsir.\"\n\nTrembling with excitement and fear I tensely waited the coming of the\nvisitor.\n\nPresently a stolid-faced young man followed the attendant into the room.\n\"You remember Holknecht,\" said the nurse, \"he is your assistant at the\nlaboratory.\"\n\nI stared stupidly at the man, and cold fear crept over me as he, with\npuzzled eyes, returned my gaze.\n\n\"You are much changed,\" he said at last. \"I hardly recognize you.\"\n\n\"I have been very ill,\" I replied.\n\nJust then the head physician came into the room and seeing me talking to\na stranger walked over to us. As I said nothing, Holknecht introduced\nhimself. The medical man began at once to enlarge upon the peculiarities\nof my condition. \"The unknown gas,\" he explained, \"acted upon the whole\nnervous system and left profound effects. Never in the records of the\nhospital has there been so strange a case.\"\n\nHolknecht seemed quite awed and completely credulous.\n\n\"His memory must be revived,\" continued the head physician, \"and that\ncan best be done by recalling the dominating interest of his mind.\"\n\n\"Captain Armstadt was wholly absorbed in his research work in the\nlaboratory,\" offered Holknecht.\n\n\"Then,\" said the physician, \"you must revive the activity of those\nparticular brain cells.\"\n\nWith that command the laboratory assistant was left in charge. He took\nhis new task quite seriously. Turning to me and raising his voice as if\nto penetrate my dulled mentality, he began, \"Do you not remember our\nwork in the laboratory?\"\n\n\"Yes, the laboratory, the laboratory,\" I repeated vaguely.\n\nHolknecht described the laboratory in detail and gradually his talk\ndrifted into an account of the chemical research. I listened eagerly to\nget the threads of the work I must needs do if I were to maintain my\nr\u00f4le as Armstadt.\n\nKnowing now that visitors were permitted me, I again grew apprehensive\nover the possible advent of Katrina. But no woman appeared, in fact I\nhad not yet seen a woman among the Germans. Always it was Holknecht and,\nstrictly according to his orders, he talked incessant chemistry.\n\n~5~\n\nThe day I resumed my normal wearing apparel I was shown into a large\nlounging room for convalescents. I seated myself a short distance apart\nfrom a group of officers and sat eyeing another group of large, hulking\nfellows at the far end of the room. These I concluded to be common\nsoldiers, for I heard the officers in my ward grumbling at the fact that\nthey were quartered in the same hospital with men of the ranks.\n\nPresently an officer came over and took a seat beside me. \"It is very\nrarely that you men in the professional service are gassed,\" he said.\n\"You must have a dull life, I do not see how you can stand it.\"\n\n\"But certainly,\" I replied, \"it is not so dangerous.\"\n\n\"And for that reason it must be stupid--I, for one, think that even in\nthe fighting forces there is no longer sufficient danger to keep up the\nmilitary morale. Danger makes men courageous--without danger courage\ndeclines--and without courage what advantage would there be in the\nmilitary life?\"\n\n\"Suppose,\" I suggested, \"the war should come to an end?\"\n\n\"But how can it?\" he asked incredulously. \"How can there be an end to\nthe war? We cannot prevent the enemy from fighting.\"\n\n\"But what,\" I ventured, \"if the enemy should decide to quit fighting?\"\n\n\"They have almost quit now,\" he remarked with apparent disgust; \"they\nare losing the fighting spirit--but no wonder--they say that the World\nState population is so great that only two per cent of its men are in\nthe fighting forces. What I cannot see is how a people so peaceful can\nkeep from utter degeneration. And they say that the World State soldiers\nare not even bred for soldiering but are picked from all classes. If\nthey should decide to quit fighting, as you suggest, we also would have\nto quit--it would intolerable--it is bad enough now.\"\n\n\"But could you not return to industrial life and do something\nproductive?\"\n\n\"Productive!\" sneered the fighter. \"I knew that you professional men had\nno courage--it is not to be expected--but I never before heard even one\nof your class suggest a thing like that--a military man do something\nproductive! Why don't you suggest that we be changed to women?\" And with\nthat my fellow patient rose and, turning sharply on his metal heel,\nwalked away.\n\nThe officer's attitude towards his profession set me thinking, and I\nfound myself wondering how far it was shared by the common soldiers. The\nnext day when I came out into the convalescent corridor I walked past\nthe group of officers and went down among the men whose garments bore no\nmedals or insignia. They were unusually large men, evidently from some\nspecially selected regiment. Picking out the most intelligent looking\none of the group I sat down beside him.\n\n\"Is this the first time you have been gassed?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Third time,\" replied the soldier.\n\n\"I should think you would have been discharged.\"\n\n\"Discharged,\" said the soldier, in a perplexed tone, \"why I am only\nforty-four years old, why should I be discharged unless I get in an\nexplosion and lose a leg or something?\"\n\n\"But you have been gassed three times,\" I said, \"I should think they\nought to let you return to civil life and your family.\"\n\nThe soldier looked hard at the insignia of my rank as captain. \"You\nprofessional officers don't know much, do you? A soldier quit and do\ncommon labor, now that's a fine idea. And a family! Do you think I'm a\nHohenzollern?\" At the thought the soldier chuckled. \"Me with a family,\"\nhe muttered to himself, \"now that's a fine idea.\"\n\nI saw that I was getting on dangerous ground but curiosity prompted a\nfurther question: \"Then, I suppose, you have nothing to hope for until\nyou reach the age of retirement, unless war should come to an end?\"\n\nAgain the soldier eyed me carefully. \"Now you do have some queer ideas.\nThere was a man in our company who used to talk like that when no\nofficers were around. This fellow, his name was Mannteufel, said he\ncould read books, that he was a forbidden love-child and his father was\nan officer. I guess he was forbidden all right, for he certainly wasn't\nright in his head. He said that we would go out on the top of the ground\nand march over the enemy country and be shot at by the flying planes,\nlike the roof guards, if the officers had heard him they would surely\nhave sent him to the crazy ward--why he said that the war would be over\nafter that, and we would all go to the enemy country and go about as we\nliked, and own houses and women and flying planes and animals. As if the\nRoyal House would ever let a soldier do things like that.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said, \"and why not, if the war were over?\"\n\n\"Now there you go again--how do you mean the war was over, what would\nall us soldiers do if there was no fighting?\"\n\n\"You could work,\" I said, \"in the shops.\"\n\n\"But if we worked in the shops, what would the workmen do?\"\n\n\"They would work too,\" I suggested.\n\nThe soldier was silent for a time. \"I think I get your idea,\" he said.\n\"The Eugenic Staff would cut down the birth rates so that there would\nonly be enough soldiers and workers to fill the working jobs.\"\n\n\"They might do that,\" I remarked, wishing to lead him on.\n\n\"Well,\" said the soldier, returning to the former thought, \"I hope they\nwon't do that until I am dead. I don't care to go up on the ground to\nget shot at by the fighting planes. At least now we have something over\nour heads and if we are going to get gassed or blown up we can't see it\ncoming. At least--\"\n\nJust then the officer with whom I had talked the day before came up. He\nstopped before us and scowled at the soldier who saluted in hasty\nconfusion.\n\n\"I wish, Captain,\" said the officer addressing me, \"that you would not\ntake advantage of these absurd hospital conditions to disrupt discipline\nby fraternizing with a private.\"\n\nAt this the soldier looked up and saluted again.\n\n\"Well?\" said the officer.\n\n\"He's not to blame, sir,\" said the soldier, \"he's off his head.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nIN A BLACK UTOPIA THE BLOND BROOD BREEDS AND SWARMS\n\n\n~1~\n\nIt was with a strange mixture of eagerness and fear that I received the\nhead physician's decision that I would henceforth recover my faculties\nmore rapidly in the familiar environment of my own home.\n\nA wooden-faced male nurse accompanied me in a closed vehicle that ran\nnoiselessly through the vaulted interior streets of the completely\nroofed-in city. Once our vehicle entered an elevator and was let down a\nbrief distance. We finally alighted in a street very like the one on\nwhich the hospital was located, and filed down a narrow passage-way. My\ncompanion asked for my keys, which I found in my clothing. I stood by\nwith a palpitating heart as he turned the lock and opened the door.\n\nThe place we entered was a comfortably furnished bachelor's apartment.\nBooks and papers were littered about giving evidence of no disturbance\nsince the sudden leaving of the occupant. Immensely relieved I sat down\nin an upholstered chair while the nurse scurried about and put the\nplace in order.\n\n\"You feel quite at home?\" he asked as he finished his task.\n\n\"Quite,\" I replied, \"things are coming back to me now.\"\n\n\"You should have been sent home sooner,\" he said. \"I wished to tell the\nchief as much, but I am only a second year interne and it is forbidden\nme to express an original opinion to him.\"\n\n\"I am sure I will be all right now,\" I replied.\n\nHe turned to go and then paused. \"I think,\" he said, \"that you should\nhave some notice on you that when you do go out, if you become confused\nand make mistakes, the guards will understand. I will speak to Lieut.\nForrester, the Third Assistant, and ask that such a card be sent you.\"\nWith that he took his departure.\n\nWhen he had gone I breathed joyfully and freely. The rigid face and\nstaring eye that I had cultivated relaxed into a natural smile and then\nI broke into a laugh. Here I was in the heart of Berlin, unsuspected of\nbeing other than a loyal German and free, for the time at least, from\nproblems of personal relations.\n\nI now made an elaborate inspection of my surroundings. I found a\nwardrobe full of men's clothing, all of a single shade of mauve like the\nsuit I wore. Some suits I guessed to be work clothes from their cheaper\ntexture and some, much finer, were evidently dress apparel.\n\nHaving reassured myself that Armstadt had been the only occupant of the\napartment, I turned to a pile of papers that the hospital attendant had\npicked up from the floor where they had dropped from a mail chute. Most\nof these proved to be the accumulated copies of a daily chemical news\nbulletin. Others were technical chemical journals. Among the letters I\nfound an invitation to a meeting of a chemical society, and a note from\nmy tailor asking me to call; the third letter was written on a\ntypewriter, an instrument the like of which I had already discovered in\nmy study. This sheet bore a neatly engraved head reading \"Katrina,\nPermit 843 LX, Apartment 57, K Street, Level of the Free Women.\" The\nletter ran:\n\n  \"Dear Karl: For three weeks now you have failed to keep\n  your appointments and sent no explanation. You surely know\n  that I will not tolerate such rude neglect. I have reported\n  to the Supervisor that you are dropped from my list.\"\n\nSo this was Katrina! Here at last was the end of the fears that had\nhaunted me.\n\n~2~\n\nAs I was scanning the chemical journal I heard a bell ring and turning\nabout I saw that a metal box had slid forth upon a side board from an\nopening in the wall. In this box I found my dinner which I proceeded to\nenjoy in solitude. The food was more varied than in the hospital. Some\nwas liquid and some gelatinous, and some firm like bread or biscuit. But\nof natural food products there was nothing save a dish of mushrooms and\na single sprig of green no longer than my finger, and which, like a\nfeather in a boy's cap, was inserted conspicuously in the top of a\nsynthetic pudding. There was one food that puzzled me, for it was\nsausage-like in form and sausage-like in flavour, and I was sure\ncontained some real substance of animal origin. Presuming, as I did at\nthat moment, that no animal life existed in Berlin, I ate this sausage\nwith doubts and misgivings.\n\nThe dinner finished, I looked for a way to dispose of the dishes.\nPacking them back in the container I fumbled about and found a switch\nwhich set something going in the wall, and my dishes departed to the\npublic dishwasher.\n\nHaving cleared the desk I next turned to Armstadt's book shelves. My\nattention was caught by a ponderous volume. It proved to be an atlas and\ndirectory of Berlin. In the front of this was a most revealing diagram\nwhich showed Berlin to be a city of sixty levels. The five lowest levels\nwere underground and all were labelled \"Mineral Industries.\" Above these\nwere eight levels of Food, Clothing and Miscellaneous industries. Then\ncame the seven workmen's residence levels, divided by trade groups.\nAbove this were the four \"Intellectual Levels,\" on one of which I, as a\nchemist had my abode. Directly above these was the \"Level of Free\nWomen,\" and above that the residence level for military officers. The\nnext was the \"Royal Level,\" double in height of the other levels of the\ncity. Then came the \"Administrative Level,\" followed by eight maternity\nlevels, then four levels of female schools and nine levels of male\nschools. Then, for six levels, and reaching to within five levels of the\nroof of the city, were soldiers' barracks. Three of the remaining floors\nwere labelled \"Swine Levels\" and one \"Green Gardens.\" Just beneath the\nroof was the defence level and above that the open roof itself.\n\nIt was a city of some three hundred metres in height with mineral\nindustries at the bottom and the swine levels--I recalled the\nsausage--at the top. Midway between, remote from possible attack through\nmines or from the roof, Royalty was sheltered, while the other\nprivileged groups of society were stratified above and below it.\n\nFollowing the diagram of levels was a most informing chart arranged like\na huge multiplication table. It gave after each level the words\n\"permitted,\" \"forbidden,\" and \"permitted as announced,\" arranged in\ncolumns for each of the other levels. From this I traced out that as a\nchemist I was permitted on all the industrial, workmen's and\nintellectual levels, and on the Level of Free Women. I was permitted, as\nannounced, on the Administrative and Royal Levels; but forbidden on the\nlevels of military officers and soldiers' barracks, maternity and male\nand female schools.\n\nI found that as a chemist I was particularly fortunate for many other\ngroups were given even less liberty. As for common workmen and soldiers,\nthey were permitted on no levels except their own.\n\nThe most perplexing thing about this system was the apparent segregation\nof such large groups of men from women. Family life in Germany was\nevidently wonderfully altered and seemingly greatly restricted, a\ncondition inconsistent with the belief that I had always held--that the\nGerman race was rapidly increasing.\n\nTurning to my atlas index I looked up the population statistics of the\ncity, and found that by the last census it was near three hundred\nmillion. And except for the few millions in the mines this huge mass of\nhumanity was quartered beneath a single roof. I was greatly surprised,\nfor this population figure was more than double the usual estimates\ncurrent in the outside world. Coming from a world in which the ancient\ntendency to congest in cities had long since been overcome, I was\nstaggered by the fact that nearly as many people were living in this one\ncity as existed in the whole of North America.\n\nYet, when I figured the floor area of the city, which was roughly oval\nin shape, being eight kilometres in breadth and eleven in length, I\nfound that the population on a given floor area was no greater than it\nhad been in the Island of Manhattan before the reform land laws were put\ninto effect in the latter part of the Twentieth Century. There was,\ntherefore, nothing incredible in these figures of total population, but\nwhat I next discovered was a severe strain on credence. It was the\nGerman population by sexes; the figures showed that there were nearly\ntwo and a half males for every female! According to the usual estimate\nof war losses the figure should have been at a ratio of six women living\nto about five men, and here I found them recorded as only two women to\nfive men. Inspection of the birth rate showed an even higher proportion\nof males. I consulted further tables that gave births by sexes and\ngroups. These varied somewhat but there was this great preponderance of\nmales in every class but one. Only among the seventeen thousand members\nof Royalty did the proportion of the sexes approach the normal.\n\nApparently I had found an explanation of the careful segregation of\nGerman women--there were not enough to go around!\n\nTurning the further pages of my atlas I came upon an elaborately\nillustrated directory of the uniforms and insignia of the various\nmilitary and civil ranks and classes. As I had already anticipated, I\nfound that any citizen in Berlin could immediately be placed in his\nproper group and rank by his clothing, which was prescribed with\nmilitary exactness.\n\nVarious fabrics and shades indicated the occupational grouping while\ntrimmings and insignia distinguished the ranks within the groups. In all\nthere were many hundreds of distinct uniforms. Two groups alone proved\nexceptions to this iron clad rule; Royalty and free women were permitted\nto dress as they chose and were restricted only in that they were\nforbidden to imitate the particular uniforms of other groups.\n\nI next investigated the contents of Armstadt's desk. My most interesting\nfind was a checkbook, with receipts and expenditures carefully recorded\non the stubs. From this I learned that, as Armstadt, I was in receipt of\nan income of five thousand marks, paid by the Government. I did not know\nhow much purchasing value that would amount to, but from the account\nbook I saw that the expenses had not equalled a third of it, which\nexplained why there was a bank balance of some twenty thousand marks.\n\nClearly I would need to master the signature of Karl Armstadt so I\nsearched among the papers until I found a bundle of returned decks. Many\nof the larger checks had been made out to \"Katrina,\" others to the\n\"Master of Games,\"--evidently to cover gambling losses. The smaller\nchecks, I found by reference to the stubs, were for ornaments or\nentertainment that might please a woman. The lack of the more ordinary\nitems of expenditure was presently made clear by the discovery of a\nnumber of punch marked cards. For intermittent though necessary\nexpenses, such as tonsorial service, clothing and books. For the more\nconstant necessities of life, such as rent, food, laundry and\ntransportation, there was no record whatever; and I correctly assumed\nthat these were supplied without compensation and were therefore not a\nmatter of personal choice or permissible variation. Of money in its\nancient form of metal coins and paper, I found no evidence.\n\n~3~\n\nIn my mail the next morning I found a card signed by Lieut. Forrester of\nthe hospital staff. It read:\n\n\"The bearer, Karl Armstadt, has recently suffered from gas poisoning\nwhile defending the mines beneath enemy territory. This has affected his\nmemory. If he is therefore found disobeying any ruling or straying\nbeyond his permitted bounds, return him to his apartment and call the\nHospital for Complex Gas Cases.\"\n\nIt was evidently a very kindly effort to protect a man whose loss of\nmemory might lead him into infractions of the numerous rulings of German\nlife. With this help I became ambitious to try the streets of Berlin\nalone. The notice from the tailor afforded an excuse.\n\nConsulting my atlas to get my bearings I now ventured forth. The streets\nwere tunnel-like passage-ways closed over with a beamed ceiling of\nwhitish grey concrete studded with glowing light globes. In the\nresidence districts the smooth side walls were broken only by high\nventilating gratings and the narrow passage halls from which led the\ndoors of the apartments.\n\nThe uncanny quiet of the streets of this city with its three hundred\nmillion inhabitants awed and oppressed me. Hurriedly I walked along\noccasionally passing men dressed like myself. They were pale men, with\nblanched or sallow faces. But nowhere were there faces of ruddy tan as\none sees in a world of sun. The men in the hospital had been pale, but\nthat had seemed less striking for one is used to pale faces in a\nhospital. It came to me with a sense of something lost that my own\ncountenance blanched in the mine and hospital would so remain colourless\nlike the faces of the men who now stole by me in their felted footwear\nwith a cat-like tread.\n\nAt a cross street I turned and came upon a small group of shops with\nmonotonous panelled display windows inserted in the concrete walls. Here\nI found my tailor and going in I promptly laid down his notice and my\nclothing card. He glanced casually at the papers, punched the card and\nthen looking up he remarked that my new suit had been waiting some time.\nI began explaining the incident in the mine and the stay in the\nhospital; but the tailor was either disinterested or did not comprehend.\n\n\"Will you try on your new suit now?\" he interrupted, holding forth the\ngarments. The suit proved a trifle tight about the hips, but I hastened\nto assure the tailor that the fit was perfect. I removed it and watched\nhim do it up in a parcel, open a wall closet, call my house number, and\nsend my suit on its way through one of the numerous carriers that\ninterlaced the city.\n\nAs I walked more leisurely back to my apartment by a less direct way, I\nfound my analytical brain puzzling over the refreshing quality of the\nbreezes that blew through those tunnel-like streets. With bits of paper\nI traced the air flow from the latticed faces of the elevator shafts to\nthe ventilating gratings of the enclosed apartments, and concluded that\nthere must be other shafts to the rear of the apartments for its exit.\nIt occurred to me that it must take an enormous system of ventilating\nfans to keep this air in motion, and then I remembered the liquid air\nengine I had seen in the mine, and a realization of the economy and\nefficiency of the whole scheme dawned upon me. The Germans had solved\nthe power problem by using the heat of the deeper strata of the earth to\ngenerate power through the agency of liquid air and the exhaust from\ntheir engines had automatically solved their ventilating problem. I\nrecalled with a smile that I had seen no evidence of heating apparatus\nanywhere except that which the miners had used to warm their food. In\nthis city cooling rather than heating facilities would evidently be\nneeded, even in the dead of winter, since the heat generated by the\ninhabitants and the industrial processes would exceed the radiation from\nthe exterior walls and roof of the city. Sunshine and \"fresh air\" they\nhad not, but our own scientists had taught us for generations that heat\nand humidity and not lack of oxygen or sunshine was the cause of the\ndepression experienced in indoor quarters. The air of Berlin was cool\nand the excess of vapor had been frozen out of it. Yes, the \"climate\" of\nBerlin should be more salubrious to the body, if not to the mind, than\nthe fickle environment of capricious nature. From my reasoning about\nthese ponderous problems of existence I was diverted to a trivial\nmatter. The men I observed on the streets all wore their hair clipped\nshort, while mine, with six weeks' growth, was getting rather long. I\nhad seen several barber's signs but I decided to walk on for quite a\ndistance beyond my apartment. I did not want to confront a barber who\nhad known Karl Armstadt, for barbers deal critically in the matter of\nheads and faces. At last I picked out a shop. I entered and asked for\na haircut.\n\n\"But you are not on my list,\" said the barber, staring at me in a\npuzzled way, \"why do you not go to your own barber?\"\n\nGrasping the situation I replied that I did not like my barber.\n\n\"Then why do you not apply at the Tonsorial Administrative Office of the\nlevel for permission to change?\"\n\nReturning to my apartment I looked up the office in my directory, went\nthither and asked the clerk if I could exchange barbers. He asked for my\ncard and after a deal of clerical activities wrote thereon the name of a\nnew barber. With this official sanction I finally got my hair cut and my\ncard punched, thinking meanwhile that the soundness of my teeth would\nobviate any amateur detective work on the part of a dentist.\n\nNothing, it seemed, was left for the individual to decide for himself.\nHis every want was supplied by orderly arrangement and for everything he\nmust have an authoritative permit. Had I not been classed as a research\nchemist, and therefore a man of some importance, this simple business of\ngetting a hair-cut might have proved my undoing. Indeed, as I afterwards\nlearned, the exclusive privacy of my living quarters was a mark of\ndistinction. Had I been one of lower ranking I should have shared my\napartment with another man who would have slept in my bed while I was at\nwork, for in the sunless city was neither night nor day and the whole\npopulation worked and slept in prescribed shifts--the vast machinery of\nindustry, like a blind giant in some Plutonic treadmill, toiled\nceaselessly.\n\nThe next morning I decided to extend my travels to the medical level,\nwhich was located just above my own. There were stairs beside the\nelevator shafts but these were evidently for emergency as they were\nclosed with locked gratings.\n\nThe elevator stopped at my ring. Not sure of the proper manner of\ncalling my floor I was carried past the medical level. As we shot up\nthrough the three-hundred-metre shaft, the names of levels as I had read\nthem in my atlas flashed by on the blind doors. On the topmost defence\nlevel we took on an officer of the roof guard--strangely swarthy of\nskin--and now the car shot down while the rising air rushed by us with a\nwhistling roar.\n\nOn the return trip I called my floor as I had heard others do and was\nlet off at the medical level. It was even more monotonously quiet than\nthe chemical level, save for the hurrying passage of occasional\nambulances on their way between the elevators and the various hospitals.\nThe living quarters of the physicians were identical with those on the\nchemists' level. So, too, were the quiet shops from which the physicians\nsupplied their personal needs.\n\nStanding before one of these I saw in a window a new book entitled\n\"Diseases of Nutrition.\" I went in and asked to see a copy. The book\nseller staring at my chemical uniform in amazement reached quickly under\nthe counter and pressed a button. I became alarmed and turned to go out\nbut found the door had been automatically closed and locked. Trying to\nappear unconcerned I stood idly glancing over the book shelves, while\nthe book seller watched me from the corner of his eye.\n\nIn a few minutes the door opened from without and a man in the uniform\nof the street guard appeared. The book seller motioned toward me.\n\n\"Your identification folder,\" said the guard.\n\nMechanically I withdrew it and handed it to him. He opened it and\ndiscovered the card from the hospital. Smiling on me with an air of\ncondescension, he took me by the arm and led me forth and conducted me\nto my own apartment on the chemical level. Arriving there he pushed me\ngently into a chair and stepped toward the switch of the telephone.\n\n\"Just a minute,\" I said, \"I remember now. I was not on my level--that\nwas not my book store.\"\n\n\"The card orders me to call up the hospital,\" said the guard.\n\n\"It is unnecessary,\" I said. \"Do not call them.\"\n\nThe guard gazed first at me and then at the card. \"It is signed by a\nLieutenant and you are a Captain--\" his brows knitted as he wrestled\nwith the problem--\"I do not know what to do. Does a Captain with an\naffected memory outrank a Lieutenant?\"\n\n\"He does,\" I solemnly assured him.\n\nStill a little puzzled, he returned the card, saluted and was gone. It\nhad been a narrow escape. I got out my atlas and read again the rules\nthat set forth my right to be at large in the city. Clearly I had a\nright to be found in the medical level--but in trying to buy a book\nthere I had evidently erred most seriously. So I carefully memorized the\nlist of shops set down in my identification folder and on my cards.\n\nFor the next few days I lived alone in my apartment unmolested except by\nan occasional visit from Holknecht, the laboratory assistant, who knew\nnothing but chemistry, talked nothing but chemistry, and seemed dead to\nall human emotions and human curiosity. Applying myself diligently to\nthe study of Armstadt's books and notes, I was delighted to find that\nthe Germans, despite their great chemical progress, were ignorant of\nmany things I knew. I saw that my knowledge discreetly used, might\nenable me to become a great man among them and so learn secrets that\nwould be of immense value to the outer world, should I later contrive to\nescape from Berlin.\n\nBy my discoveries of the German workings in the potash mines I had\nindeed opened a new road to Berlin. It was up to me by further\ndiscoveries to open a road out again, not only for my own escape, but\nperhaps also to find a way by which the World Armies might enter Berlin\nas the Greeks entered Troy. Vague ambitious dreams were these that\nfilled and thrilled me, for I was young in years, and the romantic\nspirit of heroic adventure surged in my blood.\n\nThese days of study were quite uneventful, except for a single\nilluminating incident; a further example of the super-efficiency of the\nGermans. I found the meals served me at my apartment rather less in\nquantity than my appetite craved. While there was a reasonable variety,\nthe nutritive value was always the same to a point of scientific\nexactness, and I had seen no shops where extra food was available. After\nI had been in my apartment about a week, some one rang at the door. I\nopened it and a man called out the single word, \"Weigher.\" Just behind\nhim stood a platform scale on small wheels and with handles like a\ngo-cart. The weigher stood, notebook in hand, waiting for me to act. I\ntook the hint and stepped upon the scales. He read the weight and as he\nrecorded it, remarked:\n\n\"Three kilograms over.\"\n\nWithout further explanation he pushed the scales toward the next door.\nThe following day I noticed that the portions of food served me were a\ntrifle smaller than they had been previously. The original Karl Armstadt\nhad evidently been of such build that he carried slightly less weight\nthan I, which fact now condemned me to this light diet.\n\nHowever, I reasoned that a light diet is conducive to good brain work,\nand as I later learned, the object of this systematic weight control was\nnot alone to save food but to increase mental efficiency, for a fat man\nis phlegmatic and a lean one too excitable for the best mental output.\nIt would also help my disguise by keeping me the exact weight and build\nof the original Karl Armstadt.\n\nAfter a fortnight of study, I felt that I was now ready to take up my\nwork in the laboratory, but I feared my lack of general knowledge of the\ncity and its ways might still betray me. Hence I began further\njourneyings about the streets and shops of those levels where a man of\nmy class was permitted to go.\n\n~4~\n\nAfter exhausting the rather barren sport of walking about the monotonous\nstreets of the four professional levels I took a more exciting trip down\ninto the lower levels of the city where the vast mechanical industries\nheld sway. I did not know how much freedom might be allowed me, but I\nreasoned that I would be out of my supposed normal environment and hence\nmy ignorance would be more excusable and in less danger of betraying me.\n\nAlighting from the elevator, I hurried along past endless rows of heavy\ncolumns. I peered into the workrooms, which had no enclosing walls, and\ndiscovered with some misgiving that I seemed to have come upon a race of\ngiants. The men at the machines were great hulking fellows with thick,\nheavy muscles such as one would expect to see in a professional wrestler\nor weight-lifter. I paused and tried to gauge the size of these men: I\ndecided that they were not giants for I had seen taller men in the outer\nworld. Two officials of some sort, distinguishable by finer garb,\nwalking among them, appeared to be men of average size, and the tops of\ntheir heads came about to the workers' chins. That there should be such\nmen among the Germans was not unbelievable, but the strange thing was\nthat there should be so many of them, and that they should be so\nuniformly large, for there was not a workman in the whole vast factory\nfloor that did not over-top the officials by at least half a head.\n\n\"Of course,\" I reasoned, \"this is part of German efficiency\";--for the\nmen were feeding large plates through stamping mills--\"they have\nselected all the large men for this heavy work.\" Then as I continued to\ngaze it occurred to me that this bright metal these Samsons were\nhandling was aluminum!\n\nI went on and came to a different work hall where men were tending wire\nwinding machinery, making the coils for some light electrical\ninstruments. It was work that girls could easily have done, yet these\nmen were nearly, if not quite, as hulking as their mates in the stamping\nmill. To select such men for light-fingered work was not efficiency but\nstupidity,--and then it came to me that I had also thought the soldiers\nI had seen in the hospital to be men picked for size, and that in a\nnormal population there could not be such an abundance of men of\nabnormal size. The meaning of it all began to clear in my mind--the\npedigree in my own identification folder with the numerous fraternity,\nthe system of social castes which my atlas had revealed, the\ninexplicable and unnatural proportion of the sexes. These gigantic men\nwere not the mere pick from individual variation in the species, but a\ndistinct breed within a race wherein the laws of nature, that had kept\nmen of equal stature for countless centuries, even as wild animals were\nequal, had been replaced by the laws of scientific breeding. These heavy\nand ponderous labourers were the Percherons and Clydesdales of a\ndomesticated and scientifically bred human species. The soldiers,\nsomewhat less bulky and more active, were, no doubt, another distinct\nbreed. The professional classes which had seemed quite normal in\nphysical appearance--were they bred for mental rather than physical\nqualities? Otherwise why the pedigree, why the rigid castes, the\nisolation of women? I shuddered as the whole logical, inevitable\nexplanation unfolded. It was uncanny, unearthly, yet perfectly\nscientific; a thing the world had speculated about for centuries, a\nthing that every school boy knew could be done, and yet which I, facing\nthe fact that it had been done, could only believe by a strained effort\nat scientific coolness.\n\nI walked on and on, absorbed, overwhelmed by these assaulting,\nunbelievable conclusions, yet on either side as I walked was the ever\npresent evidence of the reality of these seemingly wild fancies. There\nwere miles upon miles of these endless workrooms and everywhere the same\ngross breed of great blond beasts.\n\nThe endless shops of Berlin's industrial level were very like those\nelsewhere in the world, except that they were more vast, more\nconcentrated, and the work more speeded up by super-machines and\nexcessive specialization. Millions upon millions of huge, drab-clad,\nstolid-faced workmen stood at their posts of duty, performing over and\nover again their routine movements as the material of their labors\nshuttled by in endless streams.\n\nOccasionally among the workmen I saw the uniforms of the petty officers\nwho acted as foremen, and still more rarely the administrative offices,\nwhere, enclosed in glass panelled rooms, higher officials in more\nbespangled uniforms poured over charts and plans.\n\nIn all this colossal business there was everywhere the atmosphere of\nperfect order, perfect system, perfect discipline. Go as I might among\nthe electrical works, among the vast factories of chemicals and goods,\nthe lighter labor of the textile mills, or the heavier, noisier business\nof the mineral works and machine shops the same system of colossal\ncoordinate mechanism of production throbbed ceaselessly. Materials\nflowed in endless streams, feeding electric furnaces, mills, machines;\npassing out to packing tables and thence to vast store rooms. Industry\nhere seemed endless and perfect. The bovine humanity fitted to the\nmachinery as the ox to the treadmill. Everywhere was the ceaseless\nthrobbing of the machine. Of the human variation and the free action of\nman in labour, there was no evidence, and no opportunity for its\nexistence.\n\nTurning from the mere monotonous endlessness of the workshops I made my\nway to the levels above where the workers lived in those hours when they\nceased to be a part of the industrial mechanism of production; and\neverywhere were drab-coloured men for these shifts of labour were\narranged so that no space at any time was wholly idle. I now passed by\nmiles of sleeping dormitories, and other miles of gymnasiums, picture\ntheatres and gaming tables, and, strikingly incongruous with the\natmosphere of the place, huge assembly rooms which were labelled \"Free\nSpeech Halls.\" I started to enter one of these, where some kind of a\nmeeting was in progress, but I was thrust back by a great fellow who\ngrinned foolishly and said: \"Pardon, Herr Captain, it is forbidden you.\"\n\nThrough half-darkened streets, I again passed by the bunk-shelved\nsleeping chambers with their cavernous aisles walled with orderly rows\nof lockers. Again I came to other barracks where the men were not yet\nasleep but were straggling in and sitting about on the lowest bunks of\nthese sterile makeshift homes.\n\nI then came into a district of mess halls where a meal was being served.\nHere again was absolute economy and perfect system. The men dined at\nendless tables and their food like the material for their labours, was\nserved to the workers by the highly efficient device of an endless\nmoving belt that rolled up out of a slot in the floor at the end of the\ntable after the manner of the chained steps of an escalator.\n\nFrom the moving belts the men took their portions, and, as they finished\neating, they cleared away by setting the empty dishes back upon the\nmoving belt. The sight fascinated me, because of the adaptation of this\nmechanical principle to so strange a use, for the principle is old and,\nas every engineer knows, was instrumental in founding the house of\nDetroit Vehicle Kings that once dominated the industrial world. The\nfounder of that illustrious line gave the poorest citizen a motor car\nand disrupted the wage system of his day by paying his men double the\nstandard wage, yet he failed to realize the full possibilities of\nefficiency for he permitted his men to eat at round tables and be served\nby women! Truly we of the free world very narrowly escaped the fetish of\nefficiency which finally completely enslaved the Germans.\n\nEach of the long tables of this Berlin dining hall, the ends of which\nfaced me, was fenced off from its neighbours. At the entrance gates were\nsigns which read \"2600 Calories,\" \"2800 Calories,\" \"3000 Calories\"--I\nfollowed down the line to the sign which read \"Maximum Diet, 4000\nCalories.\" The next one read, \"Minimum Diet 2000 Calories,\" and thence\nthe series was repeated. Farther on I saw that men were assembling\nbefore such gates in lines, for the meal there had not begun. Moving to\nthe other side of the street I walked by the lines which curved out and\nswung down the street. Those before the sign of \"Minimum Diet\" were not\nquite so tall as the average, although obviously of the same breed. But\nthey were all gaunt, many of them drooped and old, relatively the\ninferior specimens and their faces bore a cowering look of fear and\nshame, of men sullen and dull, beaten in life's battle. Following down\nthe line and noting the improvement in physique as I passed on, I came\nto the farthest group just as they had begun to pass into the hall.\nThese men, entering the gate labelled \"Maximum Diet, 4000 Calories,\"\nwere obviously the pick of the breed, middle-aged, powerful,\nHerculean,--and yet not exactly Herculean either, for many of them were\noverfull of waistline, men better fed than is absolutely essential to\nphysical fitness. Evidently a different principle was at work here than\nthe strict economy of food that required the periodic weighing of the\nprofessional classes.\n\nTurning back I now encountered men coming out of the dining hall in\nwhich I had first witnessed the meal in progress. I wanted to ask\nquestions and yet was a little afraid. But these big fellows were\nseemingly quite respectful; except when I started to enter the Free\nSpeech Hall, they had humbly made way for me. Emboldened by their\ndeference I now approached a man whom I had seen come out of a \"3800\nCalories\" gate, and who had crossed the street and stood there picking\nhis teeth with his finger nail.\n\nHe ceased this operation as I approached and was about to step aside.\nBut I paused and smiled at him, much, I fear, as one smiles at a dog of\nunknown disposition, for I could hardly feel that this ungainly creature\nwas exactly human. He smiled back and stood waiting.\n\n\"Perhaps, I stammered,\" you will tell me about your system of eating; it\nseems very interesting.\"\n\n\"I eat thirty-eight,\" he grinned, \"pretty good, yes? I am twenty-five\nyears old and not so tall either.\"\n\nI eyed him up--my eyes came just to the top button of his jacket.\n\n\"I began thirty,\" continued the workman, \"I came up one almost every\nyear, one year I came up two at once. Pretty good, yes? One more\nto come.\"\n\n\"What then?\" I asked.\n\nThe big fellow smiled with a childish pride, and doubling up his arm, as\nhuge as an average man's thigh, he patted his biceps. \"I get it all\nright. I pass examination, no flaws in me, never been to hospital, not\none day. Yes, I get it.\"\n\n\"Get what?\"\n\n\"Paternity,\" said the man in a lower voice, as he glanced about to see\nif any of his fellows was listening. \"Paternity, you know? Women!\"\n\nI thought of many questions but feared to ask them. The worker waited\nfor some men to pass, then he bent over me, grinning sardonically. \"Did\nyou see them? You have seen women, yes?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I ventured, \"I have seen women.\"\n\n\"Pretty good, beautiful, yes?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I stammered, \"they are very beautiful.\" But I was getting nervous\nand moved away. The workman, hesitating a little, then followed at\nmy side.\n\n\"But tell me,\" I said, \"about these calories. What did you do to get the\nbig meals? Why do some get more to eat than others?\"\n\n\"Better man,\" he replied without hesitation.\n\n\"But what makes a better man?\"\n\n\"You don't know; of course, you are an intellectual and don't work. But\nwe work hard. The harder we work the more we eat. I load aluminum pigs\non the elevator. One pig is two calories, nineteen hundred pigs a day,\npretty good, yes? All kind of work has its calories, so many for each\nthing to do.\n\n\"More work, more food it takes to do it. They say all is alike, that no\none can get fat. But all work calories are not alike because some men\nget fatter than others. I don't get fat; my work is hard. I ought to get\ntwo and a half calories for each pig I load. Still I do not get thin,\nbut I do not play hard in gymnasium, see? Those lathe men, they got it\ntoo easy and they play hard in gymnasium. I don't care if you do report.\nI got it mad at them; they got it too easy. One got paternity last year\nalready, and he is not as good a man as I am. I could throw him over my\nshoulder in wrestling. Do you not think they get it too easy?\"\n\n\"Do the men like this system,\" I asked; \"the measuring of food by the\namount of work one does? Do any of them talk about it and demand that\nall be fed alike?\"\n\n\"The skinny minimum eaters do,\" said the workman with a sneer, \"when we\nlet them talk, which isn't often, but when they get a chance they talk\nBellamism. But what if they do talk, it does them no good. We have a red\nflag, we have Imperial Socialism; we have the House of Hohenzollern.\nWell, then, I say, let them talk if they want to, every man must eat\naccording to his work; that is socialism. We can't have Bellamism when\nwe have socialism.\"\n\nThis speech, so much more informative and evidencing a knowledge I had\nnot anticipated, quite disturbed me. \"You talk about these things,\" I\nventured, \"in your Free Speech Halls?\"\n\nThe hitherto pleasant face of the workingman altered to an ugly frown.\n\n\"No you don't,\" he growled, \"you don't think because I talk to you, that\nyou can go asking me what is not your right to know, even if you are\nan officer?\"\n\nI remained discreetly silent, but continued to walk at the side of the\nstriding giant. Presently I asked:\n\n\"What do you do now, are you going to work?\"\n\n\"No,\" he said, looking at me doubtfully, \"that was dinner, not\nbreakfast. I am going now to the picture hall.\"\n\n\"And then,\" I asked, \"do you go to bed?\"\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"we then go to the gymnasium or the gaming tables. Six\nhours' work, six hours' sleep, and four hours for amusement.\"\n\n\"And what do you do,\" I asked, \"the remainder of the day?\"\n\nHe turned and stared at me. \"That is all we get here, sixteen hours.\nThis is the metal workers' level. Some levels get twenty hours. It\ndepends on the work.\"\n\n\"But,\" I said, \"a real day has twenty-four hours.\"\n\n\"I've heard,\" he said, \"that it does on the upper levels.\"\n\n\"But,\" I protested, \"I mean a real day--a day of the sun. Do you\nunderstand that?\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" he said, \"we see the pictures of the Place in the Sun. That's\na fine show.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" I said, \"then you have pictures of the sun?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" he replied, \"the sun that shines upon the throne. We all\nsee that.\"\n\nAt the time I could not comprehend this reference, but I made bold to\nask if it were forbidden me to go to his picture hall.\n\n\"I can't make out,\" he said, \"why you want to see, but I never heard of\nany order forbidding it.\n\n\"I go here,\" he remarked, as we came to a picture theatre.\n\nI let my Herculean companion enter alone, but followed him shortly and\nfound a seat in a secluded corner. No one disputed my presence.\n\nThe music that filled the hall from some hidden horn was loud and, in a\nrough way, joyous. The pictures--evidently carefully prepared for such\nan audience--were limited to the life that these men knew. The themes\nwere chiefly of athletic contests, of boxing, wrestling and feats of\nstrength. There were also pictures of working contests, always ending by\nthe awarding of honours by some much bespangled official. But of love\nand romance, of intrigue and adventure, of pathos and mirth, these\npictures were strangely devoid,--there was, in fact, no woman's likeness\ncast upon the screen and no pictures depicting emotion or sentiment.\n\nAs I watched the sterile flittings of the picture screen I decided,\ndespite the glimmering of intelligence that my talking Hercules had\nshown in reference to socialism and Bellamism and the secrets of the\nFree Speech Halls, that these men were merely great stupid beasts\nof burden.\n\nThey worked, they fed, they drank, they played exuberantly in their\ngymnasiums and swimming pools, they played long and eagerly at games of\nchance. Beyond this their lives were essentially blank. Ambition and\ncuriosity they had none beyond the narrow circle of their round of\nliving. But for all that they were docile, contented and, within their\nlimitations, not unhappy. To me they seemed more and more to be like\nwell cared for domestic animals, and I found myself wondering, as I left\nthe hall, why we of the outer world had not thought to produce pictures\nin similar vein to entertain our dogs and horses.\n\n~5~\n\nAs I returned to my own quarters, I tried to recall the description I\nhad read of the \"Children of the Abyss,\" the dwellers in ancient city\nslums. There was a certain kinship, no doubt, between those former\nsubmerged workers in the democratic world and this labour breed of\nBerlin. Yet the enslaved and sweated workers of the old regime were\nalways depicted as suffering from poverty, as undersized, ill-nourished\nand afflicted with disease. The reformers of that day were always\ntalking of sanitary housing, scientific diet and physical efficiency.\nBut here was a race of labourers whose physical welfare was as well\ntaken care of as if they had been prize swine or oxen. There was a\npaleness of countenance among these labourers of Berlin that to me\nseemed suggestive of ill health, but I knew that was merely due to lack\nof sun and did not signify a lack of physical vitality. Mere\nsun-darkened skin does not mean physiological efficiency, else the negro\nwere the most efficient of races. Men can live without sun, without\nrain, without contact with the soil, without nature's greenery and the\nbrotherhood of fellow species in wild haunts. The whole climb of\ncivilization had been away from these primitive things. It had merely\nbeen an artificial perfecting of the process of giving the living\ncreature that which is needed for sustenance and propagation in the most\nconcentrated and most economical form, the elimination of Nature's\nsuperfluities and wastes.\n\nAs I thought of these things it came over me that this unholy\nimprisonment of a race was but the logical culmination of mechanical and\nmaterial civilization. This development among the Germans had been\nhastened by the necessities of war and siege, yet it was what the whole\nworld had been driving toward since man first used a tool and built a\nhut. Our own freer civilization of the outer world had been achieved\nonly by compromises, by a stubborn resistance against the forces to\nwhich we ascribed our progress. We were merely not so completely\ncivilized, because we had never been wholly domesticated.\n\nAs I now record these thoughts on the true significance of the perfected\ncivilization of the Germans I realize that I was even more right than I\nthen knew, for the sunless city of Berlin is of a truth a civilization\ngone to seed, its people are a domesticated species, they are the\nlogical outcome of science applied to human affairs, with them the\nprodigality and waste of Nature have been eliminated, they have stamped\nout contagious diseases of every kind, they have substituted for the\nlaws of Nature the laws that man may pick by scientific theory and\nexperiment from the multitude of possibilities. Yes, the Germans were\ncivilized. And as I pondered these things I recalled those fairy tales\nthat naturalists tell of the stagnant and fixed society of ants in their\nsubterranean catacombs. These insect species credited for industry and\nintelligence, have in their lesser world reached a similar perfection of\ncivilization. Ants have a royal house, they have a highly specialized\nand fixed system of caste, a completely socialized state--yes, a\nUtopia--even as Berlin was a Utopia, with the light of the sun and the\nlight of the soul, the soul of the wild free man, forever shut out. Yes,\nI was walking in Utopia, a nightmare at the end of man's long\ndream--Utopia--Black Utopia--City of Endless Night--diabolically\ncompounded of the three elements of civilization in which the Germans\nhad always been supreme--imperialism, science and socialism.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nI GO PLEASURING ON THE LEVEL OF FREE WOMEN AND DRINK SYNTHETIC BEER\n\n\n~1~\n\nI had returned from my adventure on the labour levels in a mood of\nsombre depression. Alone again in my apartment I found difficulty in\ngetting my mind back upon chemical books. With a sense of relief I\nreported to Holknecht that I thought myself sufficiently recovered to\nreturn to work.\n\nMy laboratory I found to be almost as secluded as my living quarters. I\nwas master there, and as a research worker I reported to no man until I\nhad finished the problem assigned me. From my readings and from\nHolknecht's endless talking I had fairly well grasped the problem on\nwhich I was supposed to be working, and I now had Holknecht go carefully\nover the work he had done in my absence and we prepared a report. This I\nsent to headquarters with a request for permission to start work on\nanother problem, the idea for which I claimed to have conceived on my\nvisit to the attacked potash mines.\n\nPermission to undertake the new problem was promptly granted. I now set\nto work to reproduce in a German laboratory the experiments by which I\nhad originally conquered the German gas that had successfully defended\nthose mines from the world for over a century. Though loath to make this\nrevelation, I knew of no other \"Discovery\" wherewith to gain the stakes\nfor which I was playing.\n\nEvents shaped themselves most rapidly along the lines of my best hopes.\nThe new research proved a blanket behind which to hide my ignorance. We\nneeded new material, new apparatus, and new data and I encouraged\nHolknecht to advise me as to where to obtain these things and so gained\nrequisite working knowledge.\n\nThe experiments and demonstrations finished, I made my report. My\nimmediate superior evidently quickly recognized it as a matter too\nimportant for his consideration and dutifully passed it up to his own\nsuperiors. In a few days I was notified to prepare for a demonstration\nbefore a committee of the Imperial Chemical Staff.\n\nThey came to my small laboratory with much eager curiosity. From their\nmanner of making themselves known to me I realized with joy that they\nwere dealing with a stranger. Indeed it was improbable that it should\nhave been otherwise for there were upwards of fifty thousand chemists of\nmy rank in Berlin.\n\nThe demonstration went off with a flourish and the committee were\ngreatly impressed. Means were at once taken to alter the gas with which\nthe Stassfurt mines were flooded, but I realized that meant nothing\nsince I believed that my companions had abandoned the enterprise and the\nsecret that had enabled me to invade mines had not been shared with any\none in the outer world.\n\nAs I anticipated, my revelation was accepted by the Chemical Staff as\nevidence of profound scientific genius. It followed as a logical matter\nthat I should be promoted to the highest rank of research chemists with\nthe title of Colonel. Because of my youth the more was made of the\nhonour. This promotion entitled me to double my previous salary, to a\nlarger laboratory and larger and better living quarters in a distant\npart of the city.\n\nMy assistant would now be of the rank I had previously been and as\nHolknecht was not eligible to such promotion I was removed entirely from\nall previous acquaintances and surroundings and so greatly decreased the\nchance of discovery of my true identity.\n\n~2~\n\nAfter I had removed to my new quarters I was requested to call at the\noffice of the Chemical Staff to discuss the line of research I should\nnext take up. My adviser in this matter was the venerable Herr von Uhl,\na white haired old patriarch whose jacket was a mass of decorations. The\ninsignia on the left breast indicating the achievements in chemical\nscience were already familiar to me, but those on the right breast\nwere strange.\n\nPerhaps I stared at them a little, for the old man, noting my interest,\nremarked proudly, \"Yes, I have contributed much glory to the race and\nour group,--one hundred and forty-seven children,--one hundred and four\nof them sons, fifty-eight already of a captain's rank, and twenty-nine\nof them colonels--my children of the second and third generation number\nabove two thousand. Only three men living in Berlin have more total\ndescendants--and I am but seventy-eight years of age. If I live to be\nninety I shall break all records of the Eugenic Office. It all comes of\ngood breeding and good work. I won my paternity right, when I was but\ntwenty-eight, just about your age. If you pass the physical test,\nperhaps you can duplicate my record. For this early promotion you have\nwon qualifies you mentally.\"\n\nAstonished and alarmed beyond measure I could find no reply and sat\nstaring dumbly, while Herr von Uhl, beginning to speak of chemical\nmatters, inquired if I had any preference as to the problem I should now\ntake up. Incapable of any clear thinking I could only ask if he had any\nto suggest.\n\nImmediately the old man's face brightened. \"A man of your genius,\" he\nsaid, \"should be permitted to try his brain with the greatest problems\non which the life of Germany depends. The Staff discussed this and has\nassigned you to original research for the finding of a better method of\nthe extraction of protium from the ore. To work on this assignment you\nmust of necessity share grave secrets, which, should they be disclosed,\nmight create profound fears, but your professional honour is a sufficient\nguarantee of secrecy. In this research you will compete with some of the\nmost distinguished chemists in Berlin. If you should be successful you\nwill be decorated by His Majesty and you will receive a liberal pension\ncommensurate with the value of your discovery.\"\n\nI was profoundly impressed. Evidently I had stumbled upon something of\nvital importance, the real nature of which I did not in the least\ncomprehend, and happily was not supposed to. The interview was ended by\nmy being entrusted with voluminous unpublished documents which I was\ntold to take home and study. Two armed men were ordered to accompany me\nand to stand alternate guard outside my apartment while I had the\ndocuments in my possession.\n\n~3~\n\nIn the quiet of my new abode I unsealed the package. The first sheet\ncontained the official offer of the rewards in store for success with\nthe research. The further papers explained the occasion for the gravity\nand secrecy, and outlined the problem.\n\nThe colossal consequence of the matter with which I was dealing gripped\nand thrilled me. Protium, it seemed, was the German name for a rare\nelement of the radium group, which, from its atomic weight and other\nproperties, I recognized as being known to the outside world only as a\nlaboratory curiosity of no industrial significance.\n\nBut, as used by the Germans, this element was the essence of life\nitself, for by the influence of its emanations, they had achieved the\nsynthesis of protein capable of completely nourishing the human body--a\nthing that could be accomplished in the outside world only through the\naid of natural protein derived from plants and animals.\n\nHow I wished, as I read, that my uncle could have shared with me this\nrevelation of a secret that he had spent his life in a fruitless effort\nto unravel. We had long since discovered how the Germans had synthesized\nthe carbohydrate molecule from carbon dioxide and water and built\ntherefrom the sugars, starches and fat needed for human nutrition. We\nknew quite as well how they had created the simpler nitrogen compounds,\nthat this last step of synthesizing complete food proteins--a step\nabsolutely essential to the support of human life wholly from synthetic\nfoods--the chemists of the outer world had never mastered.\n\nBut no less interesting than the mere chemistry of all this was the\nhistory of it all, and the light it threw on the larger story of how\nGermany had survived when the scientists of the world had predicted her\nspeedy annihiliation. The original use of protium had, I found, been\ndiscovered late in the Twentieth Century when the protium ores of the\nUral Mountains were still available to the German chemists. After Russia\nhad been won by the World Armies, the Germans for a time suffered\nchronic nitrogen starvation, as they depended on the protium derived\nfrom what remained of their agriculture and from the fisheries in the\nBaltic. As the increasing bombardment from the air herded them within\ntheir fast building armoured city, and drove them beneath the soil in\nall other German territory and from the surface of the sea in the\nBaltic; they must have perished miserably but for the discovery of a new\nsource of protium.\n\nThis source they had found in the uninhabited islands of the Arctic,\nwhere the formation of the Ural Mountains extends beneath the sea.\nSending their submarines thence in search of platinum ores they had not\nfound platinum but a limited supply of ore containing the even more\nvaluable protium. By this traffic Germany had survived for a century and\na half. The quantity of the rare element needed was small, for its\neffect, like that of radium, was out of all proportion to its bulk. But\nthis little they must have, and it seems that the supply of ore\nwas failing.\n\nNor was that all to interest me. How did the German submarine get to the\nArctic since the World State had succeeded, after half a century of\neffort, in damming the Baltic by closing up several passes among the\nDanish Islands and the main pass of the sound between Zealand and\nSweden? I remember, as a youngster, the great Jubilee that celebrated\nthe completion of that monumental task, and the joy that hailed from the\nannouncement that the world's shipping would at last be freed from an\nancient scourge.\n\nBut little had we of the world known the magnitude of the German fears\nas the Baltic dam neared completion. We had thought merely to protect\nour commerce from German piracy and perhaps to stop them from getting a\nlittle copper and rubber in some remote corner of the earth. But we did\nnot realize that we were about to cut them off from an essential element\nwithout which that conceited and defiant race must have speedily run up\nthe white flag of absolute surrender or have died to the last man, like\nrats in a neglected trap.\n\nBut the completion of the Baltic dam evidently had not shut off the\nsupply of Arctic ore, for the annual importation of ore was given right\nup to date though the Baltic had been closed for nearly a score of\nyears. Eagerly I searched my papers for an item that would give some\nhint as to how the submarines got out of the dammed-up Baltic. But on\nthat point the documents before me were silent. They referred to the\nArctic ore, gave elaborate details as to mineralogy and geology of the\nstrata from which it came, but as to the ways of its coming into Berlin\nthere was not the slightest suggestion. That this ore must come by\nsubmarine was obvious. If so, the submarine must be at large in the\nAtlantic and Arctic seas, and those occasional reports of periscopes\nsighted off the coast of Norway, which have never been credited, were\nreally true. The submarines, or at least their cargoes, must reach\nBerlin by some secret passage. Here indeed was a master mystery, a\nsecret which, could I unravel it and escape to the outer world with the\nknowledge, would put unconditionally within the power of the World State\nthe very life of the three hundred millions of this unholy race that was\nbred and fed by science in the armoured City of Berlin, or that, working\nlike blind moles of the earth, held the world at bay from off the\nsterile and pock-marked soil of all that was left of the one-time\nGerman Empire.\n\nThat night I did not sleep till near the waking hour, and when the\nbreakfast container bumped into the receiving cupboard I was nodding\nover the chemical papers amid strange and wonderful dreams.\n\n~4~\n\nNext day with three assistants, themselves chemists of no mean rank, I\nset to work to prepare apparatus for repeating all the known processes\nin the extraction and use of the rare and vital element. This work\nabsorbed me for many weeks, during which time I went nowhere and saw no\none and slept scarce one hour out of four.\n\nBut the steady application told upon me, and, by way of recreation, I\ndecided to spend an evening on the Level of Free Women, a place to\nwhich, much though it fascinated me, I had not yet mustered the\ncourage to go.\n\nMy impression, as I stepped from the elevator, was much as that of a man\nwho alights from a train in a strange city on a carnival night. Before\nme, instead of the narrow, quiet streets of the working and living\nquarters of the city, there spread a broad and seemingly endless hall of\nrevelry, broken only by the massive grey pillars that held up the\nmulti-floored city. The place was thronged with men of varied ranks and\nprofessions. But more numerous and conspicuous were the women, the first\nand only women that I had seen among the Germans--the Free Women of\nBerlin, dressed in gorgeous and daring costumes; women of whom but few\nwere beautiful, yet in whose tinted cheeks and sparkling eyes was all\nthe lure of parasitic love.\n\nThe multi-hued apparel of the throng dazzled and astonished me.\nElsewhere I had found a sterile monotony of dress and even of stature\nand features. But here was resplendent variety and display. Men from all\nthe professional and military classes mingled indiscriminately, their\ndivers uniforms and decorations suggesting a dress ball in the capital\nof the world. But the motley costumes of the women, who dressed with the\nlicense of unrestrained individuality, were even more startling and\nbizarre--a kaleidoscopic fantastic masquerade.\n\nI wondered if the rule of convention and tyranny of style had lost all\nhold upon these women. And yet I decided, as I watched more closely,\nthat there was not an absence of style but rather a warfare of styles.\nThe costumes varied from the veiled and beruffled displays, that left\none confounded as to what manner of creature dwelt therein, to the other\nextreme of mere gaudily ornamented nudity. I smiled as I recalled the\nworld-old argument on the relative modesty of much or little clothing,\nfor here immodesty was competing side by side in both extremes, both\nseemingly equally successful.\n\nBut it was not alone in the matter of dress that the women of the Free\nLevel varied. They differed even more strikingly in form and feature,\nfor, as I was later more fully to comprehend, these women were drawn\nfrom all the artificially specialized breeds into which German science\nhad wrought the human species. Most striking and most numerous were\nthose whom I rightly guessed to be of the labour strain. Proportionally\nnot quite so large as the males of the breed, yet they were huge,\nfull-formed, fleshly creatures, with milky white skin for the most part\ncrudely painted with splashes of vermilion and with blued or blackened\nbrows. The garishness of their dress and ornament clearly bespoke the\npoorer quality of their intellect, yet to my disgust they seemed fully\nas popular with the men as the smaller and more refined types, evidently\nfrom the intellectual strains of the race.\n\nHappily these ungainly women of the labour strain were inclined to herd\nby themselves and I hastened to direct my steps to avoid as much as\npossible their overwhelming presence.\n\nThe smaller women, who seemed to be more nearly human, were even more\nvariegated in their features and make-up. They were not all blondes,\nfor some of them were distinctively dark of hair and skin, though\nI was puzzled to tell how much of this was inborn and how much\nthe work of art. Another thing that astonished me was the wide\nrange of bodily form, as evidently determined by nutrition. Clearly\nthere was no weight-control here, for the figures varied from extreme\nslenderness to waddling fatness. The most common type was that of mild\nobesity which men call \"plumpness,\" a quality so prized since the world\nbegan that the women of all races by natural selection become relatively\nfatter than men.\n\nFor the most part I found these women unattractive and even repellent,\nand yet as I walked about the level I occasionally caught fleeting\nglimpses of genuine beauty of face and form, and more rarely expressions\nof a seeming high order of intelligence.\n\nThis revelling multitude of men and girls was uproariously engaged in\nthe obvious business of enjoying themselves by means of every art known\nto appeal to the mind of man--when intelligence is abandoned and moral\nrestraint thrown to the winds.\n\nI wended my way among the multitude, gay with colour, noisy with chatter\nand mingled music, redolent with a hundred varieties of sensuous\nperfume. I came upon a dancing floor. Whirling and twisting about the\ncolumns, circling around a gorgeous scented and iridescent fountain,\nofficers and scientists, chemists and physicians, each clasping in his\narms a laughing girl, danced with abandon to languorous music.\n\nAs I watched the dance I overheard two girls commenting upon the\nappearance of the dancers. Whirling by in the arms of a be-medalled\nofficer, was a girl whose frizzled yellow hair fell about a\ndun-brown face.\n\n\"Did you see that, Fedora, tanned as a roof guard and with that hair!\"\n\n\"Well, you know,\" said the other, \"it's becoming quite the fashion\nagain.\"\n\n\"Why don't you try it? Three baths would tan you adorably and you do\nhave the proper hair.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I have the hair, all right, but my skin won't stand it. I\ntried it three years ago and I blistered outrageously.\"\n\nThe talk drifted to less informing topics and I moved on and came to\nother groups lounging at their ease on rugs and divans as they watched\nmore skilful girls squirming through some intricate ballet on an\nexhibition platform.\n\nSeeing me stand apart, a milk-white girl with hair dyed pink came\ntugging at my arm. Her opalescent eyes looked from out her chalky\ncountenance; but they were not hard eyes, indeed they seemed the eyes of\ninnocence. As I shook my head and rebuffed her cordial advance I felt,\nnot that I was refusing the proffered love of a painted woman, but\nrather that I was meanly declining a child's invitation to join her\nplay. In haste I edged away and wandered on past endless gaming tables\nwhere men in feverish eagerness whirled wheels of chance, while garishly\ndressed girls leaned on their shoulders and hung about their necks.\n\nAnnounced by shouts and shrieking laughter I came upon a noisy jumble of\nmechanical amusement devices where men and girls in whirling upholstered\nboxes were being pitched and tumbled about.\n\nBeyond the noise of the childish whirligigs I came into a space where\nthe white ceiling lights were dimmed by crimson globes and picture\nscreens were in operation. It did not take long for me to grasp the\nessential difference between these pictured stories and those I had seen\nin the workmen's level. There love of woman was entirely absent from the\nscreen. Here it was the sole substance of the pictures. But unlike the\nlove romances of the outer world, there were no engagement rings, no\nwedding bells, and never once did the face or form of a child appear.\n\nIn seating myself to see the pictures I had carefully chosen a place\nwhere there was only room for myself between a man and one of the\nsupporting columns. At an interlude the man arose to go. The girl who\nhad been with him arose also, but he pushed her back upon the bench,\nsaying that he had other engagements, and did not wish her company. The\nmoment he was gone the girl moved over and proceeded to crowd\ncaressingly against my shoulder. She was a huge girl, obviously of the\nlabour strain. She leaned over me as if I had been a lonely child and\nshe a lonelier woman. Crowded against the pillar I could not escape and\nso tried to appear unconcerned.\n\n\"Did you like that story?\" I asked, referring to the picture that had\njust ended.\n\n\"No,\" she replied, \"the girl was too timid. She could never have won a\nroof guard captain in that fashion. They are very difficult men, those\nroof guard officers.\"\n\n\"And what kind of pictures do you prefer?\" I asked.\n\n\"Quartettes,\" she answered promptly. \"Two men and two girls when both\ngirls want the other man, and both men want the girl they have. That\nmakes a jolly plot. Or else the ones where there are two perfect lovers\nand the man is elected to paternity and leaves her. I had a man like\nthat once and it makes me sad to see such a picture.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" I said, speaking in a timorous voice, \"you wanted to go with\nhim and be the mother of his children?\"\n\nShe turned her face toward me in the dim light. \"He talked like that,\"\nshe said, \"and then, I hated him. I knew then that he wanted to go and\nleave me. That he hadn't tried to avoid the paternity draft. Yes, he\nwanted to sire children. And he knew that he would have to leave me. And\nso I hated him for ever loving me.\"\n\nA strange thrill crept over me at the girl's words. I tried to fathom\nher nature, to separate the tangle of reality from the artificial ideas\ningrained by deliberate mis-education. \"Did you ever see children? Here,\nI mean. Pictures of them, perhaps, on the screen?\"\n\n\"Never,\" said the girl, drawing away from me and straightening up till\nmy head scarce reached her shoulder. \"And I never want to. I hate the\nthought of them. I wish I never had been one. Why can't\nwe--forget them?\"\n\nI did not answer, and the labour girl, who, for some technical flaw in\nher physique had been rejected for motherhood, arose and walked\nponderously away.\n\nAfter this baffling revelation of the struggle of human souls caught in\nthe maw of machine-made science, I found the picture screen a dull dead\nthing, and I left the hall and wandered for miles, it seemed, past\nendless confusion of meaningless revelry. Everywhere was music and\ngaming and laughter. Men and girls lounged and danced, or spun the\nwheels of fortune or sat at tables drinking from massive steins, a\nhighly flavoured variety of rather ineffectual synthetic beer. Older\nwomen served and waited on the men and girls, and for every man was at\nleast one girl and sometimes as many as could crowd about him. And so\nthey sang, and banged their mugs and sloshed their frothy beverage.\n\nA lonely stranger amidst the jostling throngs, I wandered on through the\ncarnival of Berlin's Level of Free Women. Despite my longing for human\ncompanionship I found it difficult to join in this strange recrudescent\npaganism with any ease or grace.\n\nGirls, alone or in groups, fluttered about me with many a covert or open\ninvitation to join in their merry-making, but something in my halting\nmanner and constrained speech seemed to repulse them, for they would\nsoon turn away as if condemning me as a man without appreciation of the\nvalue of human enjoyment.\n\nMy constraint and embarrassment were increased by a certain sense of\nguilt, a feeling which no one in this vast throng, either man or woman,\nseemed to share. The place had its own standard of ethics, and they were\nshocking enough to a man nurtured in a human society founded on the\nsanctification of monogamous marriage. But merely to condemn this\nrecreational life of Germany, by likening it to the licentious freedom\nthat exists in occasional unrestrained amusement places in the outer\nworld, would be to give a very incorrect interpretation of Berlin's\nLevel of Free Women. As we know such places elsewhere in the world there\nis always about them some tacit confession of moral delinquency, some\npretence of apology on the part of the participants. The women who so\nrevel in the outer world consider themselves under a ban of social\ndisapproval, while the men are either of a type who have no sense of\nmoral restraint or men who have for the time abandoned it.\n\nBut for this life in Berlin no guilt was felt, no apology offered. The\nmen considered it as quite a normal and proper part of their life, while\nthe women looked upon it as their whole life, to which they had been\ntrained and educated and set apart by the Government; they accepted the\nr\u00f4le quite as did the scientist, labourer, soldier, or professional\nmother. The state had decreed it to be. They did not question its\nmorality. Hence the life here was licentious and yet unashamed, much, as\nI fancy was the life in the groves of Athens or the baths of\nancient Rome.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nI AM DRAFTED FOR PATERNITY AND MAKE EXTRAORDINARY\nPETITION TO THE CHIEF OF THE EUGENIC STAFF\n\n\n~1~\n\nMy research was progressing nicely and I had discovered that in this\nfield of chemistry also my knowledge of the outer world would give me\ntremendous advantages over all competitors. Eagerly I worked at the\nlaboratory, spending most of my evenings in study. Occasionally I\nattended the educational pictures or dined on the Level of Free Women\nwith my chemical associates and spent an hour or so at dancing or at\ncards. My life had settled into routine unbroken by adventure. Then I\nreceived a notice to report for the annual examination at the Physical\nEfficiency Laboratory. I went with some misgivings, but the ordeal\nproved uneventful. A week later I received a most disturbing\ncommunication, a bulky and official looking packet bearing the imprint\nof the Eugenic Office. I nervously slit the envelope and drew forth\na letter:\n\n\"You are hereby notified that you have reached a stage of advancement in\nyour professional work that marks you a man of superior gifts, and,\nhaving been reported as physically perfect you are hereby honoured with\nthe high privilege and sacred duties of election to paternity. Full\ninstructions for your conduct in this duty to the State will be found in\nthe enclosed folder.\"\n\nIn nervous haste I scanned the printed folder:\n\n\"Your first duty will be to visit the boys' school for which passport is\nhere enclosed. The purpose of this is to awaken the paternal instincts\nthat you may better appreciate and feel the holy obligation and\nprivilege conferred upon you. You will also find enclosed cards of\nintroduction to three women whom the Eugenic Office finds to be fitted\nas mothers of your children. That natural selection may have a limited\nplay you are permitted to select only one woman from each three\nassigned. Such selection must be made and reported within thirty days,\nafter which a second trio will be assigned you. Until such final\nselection has been recorded you are expressly forbidden to conduct\nyourself toward these women in an amorous manner.\"\n\nNext followed a set of exacting rules for the proper deportment, in the\ncarrying out of these duties to which the State had assigned me.\n\nA crushing sense of revulsion, a feeling of loathing and uncleanliness\noverwhelmed me as I pushed aside the papers. Coming from a world where\nthe right of the individual to freedom and privacy in the matrimonial\nand paternal relations was recognized as a fundamental right of man, I\nfound this officious communication, with its detailed instruction,\nappalling and revolting.\n\nA man cravenly clings to life and yet there are instincts in his soul\nwhich will cause him to sell life defiantly for a mere conception of a\nmoral principle. To become by official mandate a father of a numerous\nGerman progeny was a thing to which I could not and would not submit.\nMany times that day as I automatically pursued my work, I resolved to go\nto some one in authority and give myself up to be sent to the mines as a\nprisoner of war, or more likely to be executed as a spy. Cold reason\nshowed me the futility of neglecting or attempting to avoid an assigned\nduty. It was a military civilization and I had already seen enough of\nthis ordered life of Berlin to know that there was no middle ground of\nchoice between explicit obedience and open rebellion. Nor need I concern\nmyself with what punishment might be provided for this particular\ndisobedience for I saw that rebellion for me would mean an investigation\nthat would result in complete tearing away of the protecting mask of my\nGerman identity.\n\nBut after my first tumultuous feeling subsided I realized that something\nmore than my own life was at stake. Already possessed of much intimate\nknowledge of the life within Berlin I believed that I was in a way to\ncome into possession of secrets of vast and vital importance to the\nworld. To gain these secrets, to escape from the walls of Berlin, was a\nmore than personal ambition; it was an ambition for mankind.\n\nAfter a day or two of deliberation I therefore decided against any rash\nrebellion. Moreover, as nothing compromising was immediately required of\nme, I detached and mailed the four coupons provided, having duly filled\nin the time at which I should make the preliminary calls.\n\n~2~\n\nOn the day and hour appointed I presented the school card to the\nelevator operator, who punched it after the manner of his kind, and duly\ndeposited me on the level of schools for boys of the professional\ngroups. A lad of about sixteen met me at the elevator and conducted me\nto the school designated.\n\nThe master greeted me with obsequious gravity, and waved me to the\nvisitor's seat on a raised platform. \"You will be asked to speak,\" he\nsaid, \"and I beg that you will tell the boys of the wonderful chemical\ndiscoveries that won you the honours of election to paternity.\"\n\n\"But,\" I protested, as I glanced at the boys who were being put through\ntheir morning drill in the gymnasium, \"I fear the boys of such age will\nnot comprehend the nature of my work.\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" he replied, \"and I would rather you did not try to\nsimplify it for their undeveloped minds, merely speak learnedly of your\nwork as if you were addressing a body of your colleagues. The less the\nboys understand of it the more they will be impressed with its\nimportance, and the more ambitious they will be to become great\nchemists.\"\n\nThis strange philosophy of education annoyed me, but I did not have time\nto argue further for the bell had rung and the boys were filing in with\nstrict military precision. There were about fifty of them, all in their\ntwelfth year, and of remarkable uniformity in size and development. The\nblanched skin, which marked the adult faces of Berlin, was, in the pasty\ncountenance of those German boys, a more horrifying spectacle. Yet they\nstood erect and, despite their lack of colour, were evidently a well\nnourished, well exercised group of youngsters.\n\nAs the last boy reached his place the master motioned with his hand and\nfifty arms moved in unison in a mechanical salute.\n\n\"We have with us this morning,\" said the master, \"a chemist who has won\nthe honours of paternity with his original thought. He will tell you\nabout his work which you cannot understand--you should therefore listen\nattentively.\"\n\nAfter a few more sentences of these paradoxical axioms on education, the\nmaster nodded, and, as I had been instructed, I proceeded to talk of the\nchemical lore of poison gases.\n\n\"And now,\" said the master, when I resumed my seat, \"we will have a\nreview lesson. You will first recite in unison the creed of your caste.\"\n\n\"We are youth of the super-race,\" began the boys in a sing-song and well\ntimed chorus. \"We belong to the chemical group of the intellectual\nlevels, being born of sires who were great chemists, born of great\nchemists for many generations. It is our duty to learn while we are yet\nyoung all that we may ever need to know, to keep our minds free from\nforbidden knowledge and to resist the temptation to think on unnecessary\nthings. So we may be good Germans, loyal to the House of Hohenzollern\nand to the worship of the old German God and the divine blood of William\nthe Great.\"\n\nThe schoolmaster, who had nodded his head in unison with the rhythm of\nthe recitation, now smiled in satisfaction. \"That was very good,\" he\nsaid. \"I did not hear one faltering voice. Now you may recite\nindividually in your alphabetical order.\n\n\"Anton, you may describe the stages in the evolution of the super-man.\"\n\nAnton, a flaxen-haired youngster, arose, saluted like a wooden soldier,\nand intoned the following monologue:\n\n\"Man is an animal in the process of evolving into a god. The method of\nthis evolution is a struggle in which the weak perish and the strong\nsurvive. First in this process of man's evolution came the savage, who\nlived with the lions and the apes. In the second stage came the dark\nraces who built the so-called ancient civilizations, and fought among\nthemselves to possess private property and women and children. Third\ncame the barbarian Blond Brutes, who were destined to sire the\nsuper-race, but the day had not yet come, and they mixed with the dark\nraces and produced the mongrel peoples, which make the fourth. The fifth\nstage is the pure bred Blond Brutes, uncontaminated by inferior races,\nwhich are the men, who under God's direction, built the Armoured City of\nBerlin in which to breed the Supermen who are to conquer the mongrel\npeoples. The sixth, last and culminating stage of the evolution of man\nis the Divinity in human form which is our noble House of Hohenzollern,\ndescended physically from William the Great, and spiritually from the\nsoul of God Himself, whose statue stands with that of the Mighty William\nat the portals of the Emperor's palace.\"\n\nIt had been a noble effort for so young a memory and as the proud master\nlooked at me expectantly I could do nothing less than nod my\nappreciation.\n\nThe master now gave Bruno the following cue:\n\n\"Name the four kinds of government and explain each.\"\n\nFrom the sad-eyed youth of twelve came this flow of wisdom:\n\n\"The first form of government is monarchy, in which the people are ruled\nby a man who calls himself a king but who has no divine authority so\nthat the people sometimes failed to respect him and made revolutions and\ntried to govern themselves. The second form of government is a republic,\nsometimes called a democracy. It is usually co-existent with the lawyer,\nthe priest, the family and the greed for gold. But in reality this\ngovernment is by the rich men, who let the poor men vote and think they\nhave a share in the government, thus to keep them contented with their\npoverty. The third form of government is proletariat socialism in which\nthe people, having abolished kings and rich men, attempt to govern\nthemselves; but this they cannot do for the same reason that a man\ncannot lift himself by his shoestraps--\"\n\nAt this point Bruno faltered and his face went chalky white. The teacher\nbeing directly in front of the standing pupil did not see what had\nhappened, while I, with fleeting memory of my own school days,\nsuppressed my mirth behind a formal countenance, as the stoic Bruno\nresumed his seat.\n\nThe master marked zero on the roll and called upon Conrad, next in line,\nto finish the recitation.\n\n\"The fourth and last form of government,\" recited Conrad, \"is autocratic\nsocialism, the perfect government that we Germans have evolved from\nproletariat socialism which had destroyed the greed for private property\nand private family life, so that the people ceased to struggle\nindividually and were ready to accept the Royal House, divinely\nappointed by God to govern them perfectly and prepare them to make war\nfor the conquest of the world.\"\n\nThe recitations now turned to repetitions of the pedigree and ranking of\nthe various branches of the Royal House. But it was a mere list of names\nlike the begats of Genesis and I was not able to profit much by this\nopportunity to improve my own neglected education. As the morning wore\non the parrot-like monologues shifted to elementary chemistry.\n\nThe master had gone entirely through the alphabet of names and now\ncalled again the apt Anton for a more brilliant demonstration of his\nsystem of teaching. \"Since we have with us a chemist who has achieved\npowers of original thought, I will permit you, Anton, to demonstrate\nthat even at the tender age of twelve you are capable of\noriginal thought.\"\n\nAnton rose gravely and stood at attention. \"And what shall I think\nabout?\" he asked.\n\n\"About anything you like,\" responded the liberal minded schoolmaster,\n\"provided it is limited to your permitted field of psychic activity.\"\n\nAnton tilted back his head and gazed raptly at a portrait of the Mighty\nWilliam. \"I think,\" he said, \"that the water molecule is made of two\natoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen.\"\n\nA number of the boys shook their heads in disapproval, evidently\nrecognizing the thought as not being original, but the teacher waited in\nrespectful silence for the founts of originality to burst forth in\nAnton's mind.\n\n\"And I think,\" continued Anton, \"that if the water molecule were made of\nfour atoms of nitrogen and one of oxygen, it would be a great economy,\nfor after we had bathed in the water we could evaporate it and make air\nand breath it, and after we had breathed it we could condense it again\nand use it to drink--\"\n\n\"But that would be unsanitary,\" piped a voice from the back of the room.\n\nTo this interruption Anton, without taking his gaze from the face of\nWilliam, replied, \"Of course it would if we didn't sterilize it, but I\nwas coming to that. We would sterilize it each time.\"\n\nThe master now designated two boys to take to the guardhouse of the\nschool the lad who had spoken without permission. He then produced a red\ncardboard cross adorned with the imperial eagle and crossed test-tubes\nof the chemists' insignia and I was honoured by being asked to decorate\nAnton for his brilliant exploit in original thought.\n\n\"Our intellectual work of the day is over,\" resumed the master, \"but in\nhonour of our guest we will have, a day in advance, our weekly exercises\nin emotion. Heinrich, you may recite for us the category of emotions.\"\n\n\"The permitted emotions,\" said Heinrich, \"are: First, anger, which we\nshould feel when a weak enemy offends us. Second, hate, which is a\nhigher form of anger, which we should feel when a powerful enemy offends\nus. Third, sadness, which we should feel when we suffer. Fourth, mirth,\nwhich we should feel when our enemy suffers. Fifth, courage, which we\nfeel at all times because we believe in our strength. Sixth, humility,\nwhich we should feel only before our superiors. Seventh, and greatest,\nis pride, which we should feel at all times because we are Germans.\n\n\"The forbidden emotions are very numerous. The chief ones which we must\nguard against are: First, pity, which is a sadness when our enemy\nsuffers; to feel this is exceedingly wicked. Second, envy, which is a\nfeeling that some one else is better than we are, which we must not feel\nat all because it is destructive of pride. Third, fear, which is a lack\nof courage. Fourth, love, which is a confession of weakness, and is\npermissible only to women and dogs.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said the master, \"I will now grant you permission to feel\nsome of the permitted emotions. We will first conduct a chemical\nexperiment. I have in this bottle a dangerous explosive and as I\ndrop in this pellet it may explode and kill us all, but you must\nshow courage and not fear.\" He held the pellet above the mouth of\nthe bottle, but his eyes were on his pupils. As he dropped the\npellet into the bottle, he knocked over with his foot a slab\nof concrete, which fell to the floor with a resounding crash. A\nfew of the boys jumped in their seats, and the master gravely marked\nthem as deficient in courage.\n\n\"You now imagine that you are adult chemists and that the enemy has\nproduced a new form of gas bomb, a gas against which we have no\nprotection. They are dropping the gas bombs into our ventilating shafts\nand are killing our soldiers in the mines. You hate the enemy--hate\nhard--make your faces black with hate and rage. Adolph, you are\nexpressing mere anger. There, that is better. You never can be a good\nGerman until you learn to hate.\n\n\"And now we will have a permitted emotion that you all enjoy; the\nprivilege to feel mirth is a thing for which you should be grateful.\n\n\"An enemy came flying over Berlin--and this is a true story. I can\nremember when it happened. The roof guard shot at him and winged his\nplane, and he came down in his parachute, which missed the roof of the\ncity and fell to the earth outside the walls but within the first ring\nof the ray defences. He knew that he could not pass beyond this and he\nwandered about for many days within range of the glasses of the roof\nguards. When he was nearly starved he came near the wall and waved his\nwhite kerchief, which meant he wished to surrender and be taken into\nthe city.\"\n\nAt this point one of the boys tittered, and the master stopped his story\nlong enough to mark a credit for this first laugh.\n\n\"As the enemy aviator continued to walk about waving his cowardly flag\nanother enemy plane saw him and let down a line, but the roof guards\nshelled and destroyed the plane. Then other planes came and attempted to\npick up the man with lines. In all seven planes were destroyed in\nattempting to rescue one man. It was very foolish and very comical. At\nlast the eighth plane came and succeeded in reaching the man a line\nwithout being winged. The roof batteries shot at the plane in vain--then\nthe roof gunners became filled with good German hate, and one of them\naimed, not at the plane, but at the man swinging on the unstable wire\nline two thousand metres beneath. The shell exploded so near that the\nman disappeared as by magic, and the plane flew off with the empty\ndangling line.\"\n\nAs the story was finished the boys who had listened with varying degrees\nof mechanical smiles now broke out into a chorus of raucous laughter. It\nwas a forced unnatural laughter such as one hears from a bad actor\nattempting to express mirth he does not feel.\n\nWhen the boys had ceased their crude guffaws the master asked, \"Why did\nyou laugh?\"\n\n\"Because,\" answered Conrad, \"the enemy were so stupid as to waste seven\nplanes trying to save one man.\"\n\n\"That is fine,\" said the master; \"we should always laugh when our enemy\nis stupid, because then he suffers without knowing why he suffers. If\nthe enemy were not stupid they would cease fighting and permit us to\nrule them and breed the stupidity out of them, as it has been bred out\nof the Germans by our good old God and the divine mind of the House of\nHohenzollern.\"\n\nThe boys were now dismissed for a recess and went into the gymnasium to\nplay leap frog. But the sad-eyed Bruno promptly returned and saluted.\n\n\"You may speak,\" said the master.\n\n\"I wish, Herr Teacher,\" said Bruno, \"to petition you for permission to\nfight with Conrad.\"\n\n\"But you must not begin a fight,\" admonished the master, \"unless you can\nattach to your opponent the odium of causing the strife.\"\n\n\"But he did cause the odium,\" said Bruno; \"he stuck it into my leg with\na pin while I was reciting. The Herr Father saw him do it, \"--and the\nboy turned his eyes towards me in sad and serious appeal.\n\nThe schoolmaster glanced at me inquiringly and I corroborated the lad's\naccusation.\n\n\"Then,\" said the master, \"you have a _casus belli_ that is actually\ntrue, and if you can make Conrad admit his guilt I will exchange your\nmark for his.\"\n\nBruno saluted again and started to leave. Then he turned back and said,\n\"But Conrad is two kilograms heavier than I am, and he may not\nadmit it.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said the teacher, \"you must know that I cannot exchange the\nmarks, for victory in a fight compensates for the fault that caused it.\nBut if you wish I will change the marks now, but then you cannot fight.\"\n\n\"But I wish to fight,\" said Bruno, \"and so does Conrad. We arranged it\nbefore recitation that he was to stick me with the pin.\"\n\n\"Such diplomacy!\" exulted the master when the lad had gone, \"and to\nthink that they can only be chemists!\"\n\n~3~\n\nAs the evening hour drew near which I had set for my call on the first\nof the potential mothers assigned me by the Eugenic Staff, I re-read the\nrules for my conduct:\n\n\"On the occasion of this visit you must wear a full dress uniform,\nincluding all orders, decorations and badges of rank and service to\nwhich you are entitled. This is very important and you should call\nattention thereto and explain the full dignity and importance of your\nrank and decorations.\n\n\"When you call you will first present the card of authorization. You\nwill then present your identification folder and extol the worth and\ncharacter of your pedigree.\n\n\"Then you will ask to see the pedigree of the woman, and will not fail\nto comment favourably thereon. If she be already a mother you will\ninquire in regard to her children. If she be not a mother, you will\nsupplicate her to speak of her potential children. You will extol the\nvirtue of her offspring--or her visions thereof,--and will not fail to\nspeak favourably of their promise of becoming great chemists whose\nservice will redound to the honour of the German race and the\nRoyal House.\n\n\"After the above mentioned matters have been properly spoken of, you may\ncompliment the mother upon her own intelligence and fitness as a mother\nof scientists. But you will refrain from all reference to her beauty of\nperson, lest her thoughts be diverted from her higher purpose to matters\nof personal amours.\n\n\"You will not prolong your call beyond the hours consistent with dignity\nand propriety, nor permit the mother to perceive your disposition\ntoward her.\"\n\nSurely nothing in such formal procedure could be incompatible with my\nown ideals of propriety. Taking with me my card of authorization bearing\nthe name \"Frau Karoline, daughter of Ernest Pfeiffer, Director of the\nPerfume Works,\" I now ventured to the Level of Maternity.\n\nCountless women passed me as I walked along. They were erect of form and\nplain of feature, with expressions devoid of either intelligence or\npassion. Garbed in formless robes of sombre grey, like saints\nof song and story, they went their way with solemn resignation. Some of\nthem led small children by the hand; others pushed perambulators\ncontaining white robed infants being taken to or from the nurseries for\ntheir scheduled stays in the mothers' individual apartments.\n\nThe actions of the mothers were as methodical as well trained nurses. In\ntheir faces was the cold, pallid light of the mother love of the\nmadonnas of art, uncontaminated by the fretful excitement of the mother\nlove in a freer and more uncertain world.\n\nEven the children seemed wooden cherubim. They were physically healthy\nbeyond all blemish, but they cooed and smiled in a subdued manner.\nAlready the ever present \"_verboten_\" of an ordered life seemed to have\ncrept into the small souls and repressed the instincts of anarchy and\nthe aspirations of individualism. As I walked among these madonnas of\nscience and their angelic offspring, I felt as I imagined a man of\nearthly passions would feel if suddenly loosed in a mediaeval and\northodox heaven; for everything about me breathed peace, goodness,\nand coldness.\n\nAt the door of her apartment Frau Karoline greeted me with formal\ngravity. She was a young woman of twenty years, with a high forehead and\npiercing eyes. Her face was mobile but her manner possessed the dignity\nof the matron assured of her importance in the world. Her only child was\nat the nursery at the time, in accordance with the rules of the level\nthat forbids a man to see his step-children. But a large photograph,\naided by Frau Karoline's fulsome description and eulogies, gave me a\nvery clear picture of the high order of the young chemist's intelligence\nthough that worthy had but recently passed his first birthday.\n\nThe necessary matters of the inspection of pedigrees and the signing of\nmy card of authorization had been conducted by the young mother with the\ncool self-possession of a well disciplined school-mistress. Her attitude\nand manner revealed the thoroughness of her education and training for\nher duties and functions in life. And yet, though she relieved me so\nskilfully of what I feared would be an embarrassing situation, I\nconceived an intense dislike for this most exemplary young mother, for\nshe made me feel that a man was a most useless and insignificant\ncreature to be tolerated as a necessary evil in this maternal world.\n\n\"Surely,\" said Frau Karoline, as I returned her pedigree, \"you could not\ndo better for your first born child than to honour me with his\nmotherhood. Not only is my pedigree of the purest of chemical lines,\nreaching back to the establishment of the eugenic control, but I myself\nhave taken the highest honours in the training for motherhood.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I acknowledged, \"you seem very well trained.\"\n\n\"I am particularly well versed,\" she continued, \"in maternal psychology;\nand I have successfully cultivated calmness. In the final tests before\nmy confirmation for maternity I was found to be entirely free from\nerotic and sentimental emotions.\"\n\n\"But,\" I ventured, \"is not maternal love a sentimental emotion?\"\n\n\"By no means,\" replied Frau Karoline. \"Maternal love of the highest\norder, such as I possess, is purely intellectual; it recognizes only the\npassions for the greatness of race and the glory of the Royal House.\nSuch love must be born of the intellect; that is why we women of the\nscientific group are the best of all mothers. Thus, were I not wholly\nfree from weak sentimentality, I might desire that my second child be\nsired by the father of my first, but the Eugenic Office has determined\nthat I would bear a stronger child from a younger father, therefore I\nacquiesced to their change of assignment without emotion, as becomes a\nproper mother of our well bred race. My first child is extremely\nintellectual but he is not quite perfect physically, and a mother such\nas I should bear only perfect children. That alone is the supreme purpose\nof motherhood. Do you not see that I am fitted for perfect motherhood?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied, as I recalled that my instructions were to pay\ncompliments, \"you seem to be a perfect mother.\"\n\nBut the cold and logical perfection of Frau Karoline dampened my\ncuriosity and oppressed my spirit of adventure, and I closed the\ninterview with all possible speed and fled headlong to the nearest\nelevator that would carry me from the level.\n\n~4~\n\nIn my first experience I had suffered nothing worse than an embarrassing\nhalf hour, so, with more confidence I pressed the bell the second\nevening, at the apartment of Frau Augusta, daughter of Gustave Schnorr,\nAuthority on Synthetic Nicotine.\n\nFrau Augusta was a woman of thirty-five. She was well-preserved, more\nhandsome and less coldly inhuman than the younger woman.\n\n\"We will get the formalities over since you have been told they are\nnecessary,\" said Frau Augusta, as she reached for my card and folder\nand, at the same time, handing me her own pedigree.\n\nPeering over the top of the chart that recorded the antecedents of\nGustave Schnorr, I saw his daughter going through my own folder with the\nbusiness-like dispatch of a society dowager examining the \"character\" of\na new housemaid.\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" she said, raising her brows. \"I thought I knew the family.\nYour Uncle Otto was my second mate. He is the father of my third son and\nmy twin girls. I have no more promising children. Have you ever met him?\nHe is in the aluminum tempering laboratories.\"\n\nI could only stare stupidly, struck dumb with embarrassment.\n\n\"No, I suppose not,\" went on Frau Augusta, \"it is hardly to be expected\nsince you have upwards of a hundred uncles.\" She arose and, going toward\na shelf where half a dozen pictures of half a dozen men reposed in an\norderly row, took the second one of the group and handed it to me.\n\n\"He is a fine man,\" she said, with a very full degree of pride for a\npast and partial possession. \"I fear the Staff erred in transferring\nhim, but then of course the twin girls were most unexpected and\nunfortunate since the Armstadt line is supposed to sire seventy-five per\ncent, male offspring.\n\n\"What do you think? Isn't the Eugenic Office a little unfair at times?\nMy fifth man thought so. He said it was a case of politics. I don't\nknow. I thought politics was something ancient that they had in old\nbooks like churches and families.\"\n\n\"I am sure I do not know,\" I murmured, as I fumbled the portrait of my\nputative uncle.\n\n\"Of course,\" continued the voluble Fran Augusta, \"you must not think I\nam criticizing the authorities. It is all very necessary. And for the\nmost part I think they have done very well by me. My ten children have\nsix fathers. All of them but the first were men of most gracious manner\nand superior intelligence. The first one had his paternity right\nrevoked, so I feel satisfied on that score, even if his son is not\ngifted--and yet the boy has beautiful hair--I think he would make an\nexcellent violinist. But then perhaps he wouldn't have been able to\nplay, so maybe it is all right, though I would think music would be more\neasily learned than chemistry. But then since I cannot read either I\nought not to judge. I will show you his picture. I may as well show you\nall their pictures. I don't see why you elected fathers should not see\nour children--but then I suppose it might produce quarrels. Some women\nare so foolish and insist on talking about the children they have\nalready borne in a way that makes a man feel that his own children could\nnever come up to them. Now I never do that. Why should one? The future\nis always more interesting than the past. I haven't a single child that\nhas not won the porcelain cross for obedience. Even my youngest--he is\nonly fourteen months--obeys as if he were a full grown man. Some say\nmental and physical excellence are not correlated--but that is a\nprejudice because of those great labour beasts. There isn't one of my\nchildren that has fallen below the minimum growth standards, except my\nthird daughter, and her father was undersized, so it is no fault\nof mine.\"\n\nAs the loquacious mother chattered on, she produced an album, through\nwhich I now turned, inspecting the annual photographs of her blond\nbrood, each of which was labelled with the statistics of physical growth\nand the tests of psychic development.\n\nStrive as I might I could think of no comments to make, but the mother\ncame to the rescue. Unfastening the binding of the loose leaf album she\nhastily shuffled the sheets and brought into an orderly array on the\ntable before me ten photographs all taken at the age of one year. \"That\nis the only fair way to view them,\" she said, \"for of course one cannot\ncompare the picture of a boy of fifteen with an infant of one year. But\nat an equal age the comparison is fair to all and now you can surely\ntell me which is the most intelligent.\"\n\nI gazed hopelessly at the infantile portraits which, despite their\nvaried paternity, looked as alike as a row of peas in a pod.\n\n\"Oh, well,\" said Frau Augusta, \"after all is it fair to ask you, since\nthe twins are your cousins?\"\n\nDesperately I wondered which were the twins.\n\n\"They resemble you quite remarkably, don't you think so? Except that\nyour hair is quite dark for an Armstadt.\" Frau Augusta turned and\nglanced furtively at my identification folder. \"Of course! your mother.\nI had almost forgotten who your mother was, but now I remember, she had\nmost remarkably dark hair. It will probably prove a dominant\ncharacteristic and your children will also be dark haired. Now I should\nlike that by way of a change.\"\n\nI became alarmed at this turn of the conversation toward the more\nspecific function of my visit, and resolved to make my exit with all\npossible speed \"consistent with dignity and propriety.\"\n\nMeanwhile, as she reassembled the scattered sheets of the portrait\nalbum, the official mother chattered on concerning her children's\nattributes, while I shifted uneasily in my chair and looked about the\nroom for my hat--forgetting in my embarrassment that I was dwelling in a\nsunless, rainless city and possessed no hat.\n\nAt last there was a lull in the monologue and I arose and said I must be\ngoing.\n\nFrau Augusta looked pained and I recalled that I had not yet\ncomplimented her upon her intelligence and fitness to be the mother of\ncoming generations of chemical scientists, but I stubbornly resolved not\nto resume my seat.\n\n\"You are young,\" said Frau Augusta, who had risen and shifted her\nposition till she stood between me and the door. \"Surely you have not\nyet made many calls on the maternity level.\" Then she sighed, \"I do not\nsee why they assign a man only three names to select from. Surely they\ncould be more liberal.\" She paused and her face hardened. \"And to think\nthat you men are permitted to call as often as you like upon those\ndegenerate hussies who have been forbidden the sacred duties of\nmotherhood. It is a very wicked institution, that level of lust--some\nday we women--we mothers of Berlin--will rise in our wrath and see that\nthey are banished to the mines, for they produce nothing but sin and\nmisery in this man-made world.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"the system is very wrong, but--\"\n\n\"But the authorities, you need not say it, I have heard it all before,\nthe authorities, always the authorities. Why should men always be the\nauthorities? Why do we mothers of Berlin have no rights? Why are we not\nconsulted in these matters? Why must we always submit?\"\n\nThen suddenly, and very much to my surprise, she placed her hands upon\nmy shoulders and said hoarsely: \"Tell me about the Free Level. Are the\nwomen there more beautiful than I?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, \"very few of them are beautiful, and those of the labour\ngroups are most gross and stupid.\"\n\n\"Then why,\" wailed Frau Augusta, \"was I not allowed to go? Why was I\npenned up here and made to bear children when others revel in the\ndelights of love and song and laughter?\"\n\n\"But,\" I said, shocked at this unexpected revelation of character,\n\"yours is the more honourable, more virtuous life. You were chosen for\nmotherhood because you are a woman of superior intelligence.\"\n\n\"It's a lie,\" cried Frau Augusta. \"I have no intelligence. I want none.\nBut I am as beautiful as they. But no, they would not let me go. They\npenned me up here with these saintly mothers and these angelic children.\nChildren, children everywhere, millions and millions of them, and not a\nman but doctors, and you elected fathers who are sent here to bring us\npain and sorrow. You say nothing of love--your eyes are cold. The last\none said he loved me--the brute! He came but thrice, when my child was\nborn he sent me a flower. But that is the official rule. And I hate him,\nand hate his child that has his lying eyes.\"\n\nThe distraught woman covered her face with her hands and burst into\nviolent weeping.\n\nWhen she had ceased her sobs I tried to explain to her the philosophy of\ncontentment with life's lot. I told her of the seamy side of the gown\nthat cloaks licentiousness and of the sorrows and bitterness of the\nashes of burned out love. With the most iridescent words at my command I\npainted for her the halo of the madonna's glory, and translated for her\nthe English verse that informs us that there is not a flower in any\nland, nor a pearl in any sea, that is as beautiful and lovely as any\nchild on any mother's knee.\n\nBut I do not think I altogether consoled Frau Augusta for my German\nvocabulary was essentially scientific, not poetic. But I made a noble\neffort and when I left her I felt very much the preacher, for the\nfunction of the preacher, not unlike death, is to make us cling to those\nills we have when we would fly to others that we know not of.\n\n~5~\n\nThere remained but one card unsigned of the three given me.\n\nFrau Matilda, daughter of Siegfried Oberwinder, Analine Analyst, was\nregistered as eighteen and evidently an inexperienced mother-elect as I\nwas a father-elect. The nature of the man is to hold the virgin above\nthe madonna, and in starting on my third journey to the maternity level,\nI found hitherto inexperienced feelings tugging at my heartstrings and\nresolved that whatever she might be, I would be dignified and formal yet\nmost courteous and kind.\n\nMy ring was answered by a slender, frightened girl. She was so shy that\nshe could only nod for me to enter. I offered my card and folder,\nsmiling to reassure her, but she retreated precipitously into a far\ncorner and sat staring at me beseechingly with big grey eyes that seemed\nthe only striking feature of her small pinched face.\n\n\"I am sorry if I frighten you,\" I said, \"but of course you know that I\nam sent by the eugenic authorities. I will not detain you long. All that\nis really necessary is for you to sign this card.\"\n\nShe timidly signed the card and returned it to the corner of the table.\n\nI felt extremely sorry for the fluttering creature; and, knowing that I\ncould not alter her lot, I sought to speak words of encouragement. \"If\nyou find it hard now,\" I said, \"it is only because you are young and a\nstranger to life, but you will be recompensed when you know the joys of\nmotherhood.\"\n\nAt my words a look of consecrated purpose glowed in the girl's white\nface. \"Oh, yes,\" she said eagerly. \"I wish very much to be a mother. I\nhave studied so hard to learn. I wish only to give myself to the holy\nduties of maternity. But I am so afraid.\"\n\n\"But you need not be afraid of me,\" I said. \"This is only a formal call\nwhich I have made because the Eugenic Staff ordered it so. But it seems\nto me that some better plan might be made for these meetings. Some\nsocial life might be arranged so that you would become acquainted with\nthe men who are to be the fathers of your children under less\nembarrassing circumstances.\"\n\n\"I try so hard not to be afraid of men, for I know they are necessary to\neugenics.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said dryly, \"I suppose they are, though I think I would prefer\nto put it that the love of man and woman is necessary to parenthood.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" she said in a frightened voice, \"not that, that is very\nwicked.\"\n\n\"So you were taught that you should not love men? No wonder you are\nafraid of them.\"\n\n\"I was taught to respect men for they are the fathers of children,\" she\nreplied.\n\n\"Then,\" I asked, deciding to probe the philosophy of the education for\nmaternity, \"why are not the fathers permitted to enjoy their fatherhood\nand live with the mother and the children?\"\n\nFrau Matilda now gazed at me with open-mouthed astonishment. \"What a\nbeautiful idea!\" she exclaimed with rapture.\n\n\"Yes, I rather like it myself--the family--\"\n\n\"The family!\" cried the girl in horror.\n\n\"That is what we were talking about.\"\n\n\"But the family is forbidden. It is very wrong, very uneugenic. You must\nbe a wicked man to speak to me of that.\"\n\n\"You have been taught some very foolish ideas,\" I replied.\n\n\"How dare you!\" she cried, in alarm. \"I have been taught what is right,\nand I want to do what is right and loyal. I passed all my examinations.\nI am a good mother-elect, and you say these forbidden things to me. You\ntalk of love and families. You insult me. And if you select me, I\nshall--I shall claim exemption,--\" and with that she rose and darted\nthrough the inner door.\n\nI waited for a time and then gently approached the door, which I saw had\nswung to with springs and had neither latch nor lock. My gentle rap upon\nthe hollow panel was answered by a muffled sob. I realized the\nhopelessness of further words and silently turned from the door and left\nthe apartment.\n\nThe streets of the level were almost deserted for the curfew had rung\nand the lights glowed dim as in a hospital ward at night. I hurried\nsilently along, shut in by enclosing walls and the lowering ceiling of\nthe street. From everywhere I seemed to feel upon me the beseeching,\nhaunting grey eyes of Frau Matilda. My soul was troubled, for it seemed\nto stagger beneath the burden of its realization of a lost humanity. And\nwith me walked grey shadows of other men, felt-footed through the gloom,\nand they walked hurriedly as men fleeing from a house of death.\n\n~6~\n\nMy next duty as a German father-elect was to report to the Eugenic\nOffice. There at least I could deal with men; and there I went, nursing\nrebellion yet trying my utmost to appear outwardly calm.\n\nTo the clerk I offered my three signed cards by way of introduction.\n\n\"And which do you select?\" asked the oldish man over his rimless\nglasses.\n\n\"None.\"\n\n\"Ah, but you must.\"\n\n\"But what if I refuse to do so?\"\n\n\"That is most unusual.\"\n\n\"But does it ever happen?\"\n\n\"Well, yes,\" admitted the clerk, \"but only by Petition Extraordinary to\nthe Chief of the Staff. But it is most unusual, and if he refuses to\ngrant it you may be dishonoured even to the extent of having your\nelection to paternity suspended, may be even permanently cancelled.\"\n\n\"You mean\"--I stammered.\n\n\"Exactly--you refuse to accept any one of the three women when all are\nmost scientifically selected for you. Does it not throw some doubts upon\nyour own psychic fitness for mating at all? If I may suggest, Herr\nColonel--it would be wiser for you to select some one of the three--you\nhave yet plenty of time.\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, trying to hide my elation. \"I will not do so. I will make\nthe Petition Extraordinary to your chief.\"\n\n\"Now?\" stammered the clerk.\n\n\"Yes, now; how do I go about it?\"\n\n\"You must first consult the Investigator.\"\n\nAfter a few formalities I was conducted to that official.\n\n\"You refuse to make selection?\" inquired the Investigator.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because,\" I replied, \"I am engaged upon some chemical research of most\nunusual nature--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" nodded the Investigator, \"I have just looked that up. The more\nreason you should be honoured with paternity.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" I said, \"you are not informed of the grave importance of the\nresearch. If you will consult Herr von Uhl of the Chemical Staff--\"\n\n\"Entirely unnecessary,\" he retorted; \"paternity is also important.\nBesides it takes but little time. No more than you need for recreation.\"\n\n\"But I do not find it recreation. I have not been able to concentrate my\nmind on my work since I received notice of my election to paternity.\"\n\n\"But you were warned against this,\" he said; \"you have no right to\npermit the development of disturbing romantic emotions. They may be bad\nfor your work, but they are worse for eugenics. So, if you have made\nromantic love to the mothers of Berlin, your case must be investigated.\"\n\n\"But I have not.\"\n\n\"Then why has this disturbed you?\"\n\n\"Because,\" I replied, \"this system of scientific paternity offends my\ninstincts.\"\n\nThe investigator ogled me craftily. \"What system would you prefer\ninstead?\" he asked.\n\nI saw he was trying to trap me into disloyal admissions. \"I have nothing\nto propose,\" I stated. \"I only know that I find the paternity system\noffensive to me, and that the position I am placed in incapacitates me\nfor my work.\"\n\nThe investigator made some notes on a pad.\n\n\"That is all for the present,\" he said. \"I will refer your case to the\nChief.\"\n\nTwo days later I received an order to report at once to Dr. Ludwig\nZimmern, Chief of the Eugenic Staff.\n\nThe Chief, with whom I was soon cloistered, was a man of about sixty\nyears. His face revealed a greater degree of intelligence than I had yet\nobserved among the Germans, nor was his demeanour that of haughty\nofficiousness, for a kindly warmth glowed in his soft dark eyes.\n\n\"I have a report here,\" said Dr. Zimmern, \"from my Investigator. He\nrecommends that your rights of paternity be revoked on the grounds that\nhe believes yours to be a case of atavistic radicalism. In short he\nthinks you are rebellious by instinct, and that you are therefore unsafe\nto father the coming generation. It is part of the function of this\noffice to breed the rebellious instinct out of the German race. What\nhave you to say in answer to these charges?\"\n\n\"I do not want to seem rebellious,\" I stammered, \"but I wish to be\nrelieved of this duty.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Zimmern, \"you may be relieved. If you have no\nobjection I will sign the recommendation as it stands.\"\n\nSurely, I thought, this man does not seem very bitter toward my\ntraitorous instincts.\n\nZimmern smiled and eyed me curiously. \"You know,\" he said, \"that to\npossess a thought and to speak of it indiscreetly are two\ndifferent things.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" I replied, emboldened by his words. \"A man cannot do\noriginal work in science if he possesses a mind that never thinks\ncontrary to the established order of things.\"\n\nThe clerks in the outer office must have thought my case a grievous one\nfor I was closeted with their chief for nearly an hour. Though our\nconversation was vague and guarded, I knew that I had discovered in Dr.\nLudwig Zimmern, Chief of the Eugenic Staff, a man guilty himself of the\nvery crime of possessing rebellious instincts for which he had decided\nme unfit to sire German children. And when I finally took my leave I\ncarried with me his private card and an invitation to call at his\napartment to continue our conversation.\n\n~7~\n\nIn the weeks that followed, my acquaintance with the Chief of the\nEugenic Staff ripened rapidly into a warm friendship. The frank manner\nin which he revealed his dissatisfaction with the state of affairs in\nGermany pleased me greatly. Zimmern was interested in my chemical\nresearches and quickly comprehended their importance.\n\n\"I know so little of chemistry,\" he deplored, \"yet on it our whole life\nhangs. That is why I am so glad of an opportunity to talk to you. I do\nnot approve of so much ignorance of each other's work on the part of our\nscientists. Our old university system was better. Then a scientist in\nany field knew something of the science in all fields. But now we are\nspecialized from childhood. Take, for example, yourself. You are at work\non a great problem by which all of our labour stands to be undone if you\nchemists do not solve it, and yet you do not understand how we will all\nbe undone. I think you should know more of what it means, then you will\nwork better. Is it not so?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" I said, \"but I have little time. I am working too hard now.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Zimmern, \"you should spend more time in pleasure on the\nFree Level. Two days ago I conferred with the Emperor's Advisory Staff,\nand I learned that grave changes are threatened. That is one reason I am\nso interested in this protium on which you chemists are working. If you\ndo not solve this problem and replenish the food supply, the Emperor has\ndecided that the whole Free Level with its five million women must be\nabolished. His Majesty will have no half-way measures. He is afraid to\ntake part of these women away, lest the intellectual workers rebel like\nthe labourers did in the last century when their women were taken away\npiecemeal.\"\n\n\"But what will His Majesty do with these five million women?\" I\ninquired, eagerly desirous to learn more.\n\n\"Do? What can he do with the women?\" exclaimed Dr. Zimmern in a low\npitched but vibrant voice. \"He thinks he will make workers of them. He\ndoes not seem to appreciate how specialized they are for pleasure. He\nwill make machine tenders of them to relieve the workmen, who are to be\nmade soldiers. He would make surface soldiers out of these blind moles\nof the earth, put amber glasses on them and train them to run on the\nopen ground and carry the war again into the sunlight. It is folly,\nsheer folly, and madness. His Majesty, I fear, reads too much of old\nbooks. He always was historically inclined.\"\n\nOn a later occasion Zimmern gave me the broad outlines of the history of\nGerman Eugenics.\n\n\"Our science of applied Eugenics,\" he said, \"began during the Second\nWorld War. Our scientists had long known that the same laws of heredity\nby which plants and animals had been bred held true with man, but they\nhad been afraid to apply those laws to man because the religion of that\nday taught that men had souls and that human life was something too\nsacred to be supervised by science. But William III was a very fearless\nman, and he called the scientists together and asked them to outline a\nplan for the perfection of the German race.\n\n\"At first all they advocated was that paternity be restricted to the\nsuperior men. This broke up the old-fashioned family where every man\nchose his own wife and sired as many children as he liked. There were\ngreat mutterings about that, and if we had not been at war, there would\nhave been rebellion. The Emperor told the people it was a military\nnecessity. The death toll of war then was great and there was urgent\nneed to increase the birth rate, so the people submitted and women soon\nceased to complain because they could no longer have individual\nhusbands. The children were supported by the state, and if they had\nlegitimate fathers of the approved class they were left in the mothers'\ncare. As all women who were normal and healthy were encouraged to bear\nchildren, there was a great increase in the birth rate, which came near\nresulting in the destruction of the race by starvation.\n\n\"As soon as a sufficient number of the older generation that had\nbelieved in the religious significance of the family and marriage system\nhad died out, the ambitious eugenists set about to make other reforms.\nThe birth rate was cut down by restricting the privilege of motherhood\nto a selected class of women. The other women were instructed in the\narts of pleasing man and avoiding maternity, and that is where we have\nthe origin of our free women. In those days they were free to associate\nwith men of all classes. Indeed any other plan would at first have been\nimpossible.\n\n\"A second fault was that the superior men for whom paternity was\npermitted were selected from the official and intellectual classes. The\nresult was that the quality of the labourers deteriorated. So two\nstrains were established, the one for the production of the intellectual\nworkers, and the other for producing manual workers. From time to time\nthis specialization has increased until now we have as many strains of\ninheritance as there are groups of useful characteristics known to be\nhereditary.\n\n\"We have produced some effects,\" mused Zimmern, \"which were not\nanticipated, and which have been calling forth considerable criticism.\nHis Majesty sends me memorandums nearly every year, after he reviews the\nmaternity levels, insisting that the feminine beauty of the race is, as\na whole, deteriorating. And yet this is logical enough. With the\nexception of our small actor-model strain, the characteristics for which\nwe breed have only the most incidental relation to feminine beauty. The\ntype of the labour female is, as you have seen, a buxom, fleshly beauty;\nyouth and full nutrition are essential to its display, and it soon fades.\nIn the scientific strains it seems that the power of original thought\ncorrelates with a feminine type that is certainly not beautiful.\nDoubtless not understanding this you may have felt that you were\ndiscriminated against in your assignment. But the clerical mind\nwith its passion for monotonous repetition of petty mental processes\nseems to correlate with the most exquisite and refined feminine\nfeatures. Those scintillating beauties on the Free Level who have\never at their beck our wisest men are from our clerical strain,--but\nof course they are only the rejects. It is unfortunate that you cannot\nsee the more privileged specimens in the clerical maternity level.\n\n\"But I digress to that which is of no consequence. The beauty of women is\nunimportant but the number of women is very important. When some women\nwere specialized for motherhood then there were surplus women. At first\nthey made workers of them. The war was then conducted on a larger scale\nthan now. We had not yet fully specialized the soldier class. All the\nyoung men went to war; and, when they came back and went to work, they\nbecame bitterly jealous of the women workers and made an outcry that\nthose who could not fight should not work. The men workers drove the women\nfrom industry, hoping thereby each to possess a mistress. As a result the\ngreat number of unproductive women was a drain upon the state. All sorts\nof schemes were proposed to reduce the number of female births but most of\nthese were unscientific. In studying the records it was found that the\noffspring of certain men were predominantly males. By applying this\nprinciple of selection we have, with successive generations, been able to\nreduce the proportion of female births to less than half the old rate.\n\n\"But the sexual impulse of the labourers made them restless and\nrebellious, and the support of the free women for these millions of\nworkers was a great economic waste. When animals had been bred to large\nsize and great strength their sexuality had decreased, while their power\nas beasts of burden increased. The same principle applied to man has\nresulted in more docile workers. By beginning with the soldiers and mine\nworkers, who were kept away from women, and by combining proper training\nwith the hereditary selection, we solved that problem and removed all\nknowledge of women from the minds of the workmen.\"\n\n\"But how about paternity among the workers?\" I asked.\n\n\"Those who are selected are removed to special isolated quarters. They\nare told they are being taken to serve as His Majesty's body guard; and\nthey never go back to mingle with their fellows.\"\n\nI then related for the doctor my conversation with the workman who asked\nme about women.\n\n\"So,\" said Zimmern, \"there has been a leak somewhere; knowledge is hard\nto bottle. Still we have bottled most of it and the labourer accepts his\nloveless lot. But it could not be done with the intellectual worker.\"\n\nDr. Zimmern smiled cynically. \"At least,\" he added, \"we don't propose to\nadmit that it can be done. And that, Col. Armstadt, is what I was\nremarking about the other evening. Unless you chemists can solve the\nprotium problem, Germany must cut her population swiftly, if we do not\nstarve out altogether. His Majesty's plan to turn the workmen into\nsoldiers and make workers of the free women will not solve it. It is too\nserious for that. The Emperor's talk about the day being at hand is all\nnonsense. He knows and we know that these mongrel herds, as he calls the\noutside enemy, are not so degenerate.\n\n\"We may have improved the German stock in some ways by our scientific\nbreeding, but science cannot do much in six generations, and what we\nhave accomplished, I as a member of the Eugenist Staff, can assure you\nhas really been attained as much by training as by breeding, though the\nbreeding is given the credit. Our men are highly specialized, and once\noutside the walls of Berlin they will find things so different that this\nvery specialization will prove a handicap. The mongrel peoples are more\nadaptable. Our workmen and soldiers are large in physique, but dwarfed\nof intellect. The enemy will beat us in open war, and, even if we should\nbe victorious in war, we could not rule them. Either we solve this food\nbusiness or we all turn soldiers and go out into the blinding sunlight\nand die fighting.\"\n\nI ventured as a wild remark: \"At least, if we get outside there will be\nplenty of women.\"\n\nThe older man looked at me with the superiority of age towards youth.\n\"Young man,\" he said, \"you have not read history; you do not understand\nthis love and family doctrine; it exists in the outside world today just\nas it did two centuries ago. The Germans in the days of the old surface\nwars made too free with the enemy's women, and that is why they ran us\ninto cover here and penned us up. These mongrel people will fight for\ntheir women when they will fight for nothing else. We have not bred all\nthe lust out of our workmen either. It is merely dormant. Once they are\nloosed in the outer world they will not understand this thing and they\nwill again make free with the enemy's women, and then we shall all be\nexterminated.\"\n\nDr. Zimmern got up and filled a pipe with synthetic tobacco and puffed\nenergetically as he walked about the room. \"What do you say about this\nprotium ore?\" he asked; \"will you be able to solve the problem?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"I think I shall.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" replied my host, \"and yet sometimes I do not care; somehow\nI want this thing to come to an end. I want to see what is outside there.\nI think, perhaps, I would like to fly.\n\n\"What troubles me is that I do not see how we can ever do it. We have\nbred and trained our race into specialization and stupidity. We wouldn't\nknow how to go out and join this World State if they would let us.\"\n\nDr. Zimmern paced the room in silence for a time. \"Do you know,\" he\nsaid, \"I should like to see a negro, a black man with kinky hair--it\nmust be queer.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered, \"there must be many queer things out there.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nIN WHICH I LEARN THAT COMPETITION IS STILL\nTHE LIFE OF THE OLDEST TRADE IN THE WORLD\n\n\n~1~\n\nWhen I told Dr. Zimmern that I should solve the problem of the increase\nof the supply of protium I may have been guilty of speaking of hopes as\nif they were certainties. My optimism was based on the discovery that\nthe exact chemical state of the protium in the ore was unknown, and that\nit did not exist equally in all samples of the ore.\n\nAfter some further months of labour I succeeded in determining the exact\nchemical ingredients of the ore, and from this I worked rapidly toward a\nnew process of extraction that would greatly increase the total yield of\nthe precious element. But this fact I kept from my assistants whose work\nI directed to futile researches while I worked alone after hours in\nfollowing up the lead I had discovered.\n\nDuring the progress of this work I was not always in the laboratory. I\nhad become a not infrequent visitor to the Level of the Free Women. The\ncontinuous carnival of amusement had an attraction for me, as it must\nhave had for any tired and lonely man. But it was not merely the lure of\nsensuous pleasures that appealed to me, for I was also fascinated with\nthe deeper and more tragic aspect of life beneath the gaudy surface of\nhectic joy.\n\nSome generalities I had picked up from observation and chance\nconversations. As a primary essential to life on the level I had quickly\nlearned that money was needed, and my check book was in frequent demand.\nThe bank provided an aluminum currency for the pettier needs of the\nrecreational life, but neither the checks nor the currency had had value\non other levels, since there all necessities were supplied without cost\nand luxuries were unobtainable. This strange retention of money\ncirculation and general freedom of personal conduct exclusively on the\nFree Level puzzled me. Thus I found that food and drink were here\navailable for a price, a seeming contradiction to the strict limitations\nof the diet served me at my own quarters. At first it seemed I had\ndiscovered a way to defeat that limitation--but there was the weigher to\nbe considered.\n\nIt was a queer ensemble, this life in the Black Utopia of Berlin, a\ncombination of a world of rigid mechanistic automatism in the regular\nroutine of living with rioting individual license in recreational\npleasure. The Free Level seemed some ancient Bagdad, some Bourbon Court,\nsome Monte Carlo set here, an oasis of flourishing vice in a desert of\nsterile law-made, machine-executed efficiency and puritanically ordered\nlife. Aided by a hundred ingenious wheels and games of chance, men and\nwomen gambled with the coin and credit of the level. These games were\npresided over by crafty women whose years were too advanced to permit of\na more personal means of extracting a living from the grosser passions\nof man. Some of these aged dames were, I found, quite highly regarded\nand their establishments had become the rendezvous for many younger\nwomen who by some arrangement that I could not fathom plied their\ntraffic in commercialized love under the guidance of these subtler women\nwho had graduated from the school of long experience in preying\nupon man.\n\nBut only the more brilliant women could so establish themselves for the\nyears of their decline. There were others, many others, whose beauty had\nfaded without an increase in wit, and these seemed to be serving their\nmore fortunate sisters, both old and young, in various menial\ncapacities. It was a strange anachronism in this world where men's more\nweighty affairs had been so perfectly socialized, to find woman\nretaining, evidently by men's permission, the individualistic right to\nexploit her weaker sister.\n\nThe thing confounded me, and yet I recalled the well known views of our\nsociological historians who held that it was woman's greater\nindividualism that had checked the socialistic tendencies of the world.\nHad the Germans then achieved and maintained their rigid socialistic\norder by retaining this incongruous vestige of feminine commercialism as\na safety valve for the individualistic instincts of the race?\n\nThey called it the Free Level, and I marvelled at the nature of this\nfreedom. Freedom for licentiousness, for the getting and losing of money\nat the wheels of fortune, freedom for temporary gluttony and the mild\nintoxication of their flat, ill-flavoured synthetic beer. A tragic\nsymbol it seemed to me of the ignobility of man's nature, that he will\nbe a slave in all the loftier aspects of living if he can but retain his\nfreedom for his vices and corruptions. Had the Germans then, like the\nvillain of the moral play, a necessary part in the tragedy of man; did\nthey exist to show the other races of the earth the way they\nshould not go? But the philosophy of this conception collapsed when I\nrecalled that for more than a century the world had lost all sight of\nthe villain and yet had not in the least deteriorated from a lack of the\nhorrible example.\n\nFrom these vaguer speculations concerning the Free Level of Berlin that\nexisted like a malformed vestigial organ in the body of that socialized\nstate, my mind came back to the more human, more personal side of the\nproblem thus presented me. I wanted to know more of the lives of these\nwomen who maintained Germany's remnant of individualism.\n\nTo what extent, I asked myself, have the true instincts of womanhood and\nthe normal love of man and child been smothered out of the lives of\nthese girls? What secret rebellions are they nursing in their hearts? I\nwondered, too, from what source they came, and why they were selected\nfor this life, for Zimmern had not adequately enlightened me on\nthis point.\n\nPondering thus on the secret workings in the hearts of these girls, I\nsat one evening amid the sensuous beauty of the Hall of Flowers. I\nmarvelled at how little the Germans seemed to appreciate it, for it was\nfar less crowded than were the more tawdry places of revelry. Here\nwithin glass encircling walls, preserved through centuries of artificial\nexistence, feeding from pots of synthetic soil and stimulated by\nperpetual light, marvellous botanical creations flourished and flowered\nin prodigal profusion. Ponderous warm-hued lilies floated on the\nsprinkled surface of the fountain pool. Orchids, dangling from the metal\nlattice, hung their sensuous blossoms in vapour-laden air. Luxurious\nvines, climatized to this unreal world, clambered over cosy arbours, or\nclung with gripping fingers to the mossy concrete pillars.\n\n~2~\n\nI was sitting thus in moody silence watching the play of the fountain,\nwhen, through the mist, I saw the lonely figure of a girl standing in\nthe shadows of a viny bower. She was toying idly with the swaying\ntendrils. Her hair was the unfaded gold of youth. Her pale dress of\nsilvery grey, unmarred by any clash of colour, hung closely about a form\nof wraith-like slenderness.\n\nI arose and walked slowly toward her. As I approached she turned toward\nme a face of flawless girlish beauty, and then as quickly turned away as\nif seeking a means of escape.\n\n\"I did not mean to intrude,\" I said.\n\nShe did not answer, but when I turned to go, to my surprise, she stepped\nforward and walked at my side.\n\n\"Why do you come here alone?\" she asked shyly, lifting a pensive\nquestioning face.\n\n\"Because I am tired of all this tawdry noise. But you,\" I said, \"surely\nyou are not tired of it? You cannot have been here long.\"\n\n\"No,\" she replied, \"I have not. Only thirty days\"; and her blue eyes\ngleamed with childish pride.\n\n\"And that is why you seem so different from them all?\"\n\nTimidly she placed her hand upon my arm. \"So you,\" she said gratefully,\n\"you understand that I am not like them-that is, not yet.\"\n\n\"You do not act like them,\" I replied, \"and what is more, you act as if\nyou did not want to be like them. It surely cannot be merely that you\nare new here. The other girls when they come seem so eager for this\nlife, to which they have long been trained. Were you not trained for\nit also?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she admitted, \"they tried to train me for it, but they could not\nkill my artist's soul, for I was not like these others, born of a strain\nwherein women can only be mothers, or, if rejected for that, come here.\nI was born to be a musician, a group where women may be something more\nthan mere females.\"\n\n\"Then why are you here?\" I asked.\n\n\"Because,\" she faltered, \"my voice was imperfect. I have, you see, the\nsoul of an artist but lack the physical means to give that soul\nexpression. And so they transferred me to the school for free women,\nwhere I have been courted by the young men of the Royal House. But of\ncourse you understand all that.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"I know something of it; but my work has always so\nabsorbed me that I have not had time to think of these matters. In fact,\nI come to the Free Level much less than most men.\"\n\nFor a moment, it seemed, her eyes hardened in cunning suspicion, but as\nI returned her intent gaze I could fathom only the doubts and fears of\nchildish innocence.\n\n\"Please let us sit down,\" I said; \"it is so beautiful here; and then\ntell me all about yourself, how you have lived your childhood, and what\nyour problems are. It may be that I can help you.\"\n\n\"There is not much to tell,\" she sighed, as she seated herself beside\nme. \"I was only eight years old when the musical examiners condemned my\nvoice and so I do not remember much about the music school. In the other\nschool where they train girls for the life on the Free Level, they\ntaught us dancing, and how to be beautiful, and always they told us that\nwe must learn these things so that the men would love us. But the only\nmen we ever saw were the doctors. They were always old and serious and I\ncould not understand how I could ever love men. But our teachers would\ntell us that the other men would be different. They would be handsome\nand young and would dance with us and bring us fine presents. If we were\npleasing in their sight they would take us away, and we should each have\nan apartment of our own, and many dresses with beautiful colours, and\nthere would be a whole level full of wonderful things and we could go\nabout as we pleased, and dance and feast and all life would be love and\njoy and laughter.\n\n\"Then, on the 'Great Day,' when we had our first individual dresses--for\nbefore we had always worn uniforms--the men came. They were young\nmilitary officers and members of the Royal House who are permitted to\nselect girls for their own exclusive love. We were all very shy at\nfirst, but many of the girls made friends with the men and some of them\nwent away that first day. And after that the men came as often as they\nliked and I learned to dance with them, and they made love to me and\ntold me I was very beautiful. Yet somehow I did not want to go with\nthem. We had been told that we would love the men who loved us. I don't\nknow why, but I didn't love any of them. And so the two years passed and\nthey told me I must come here alone. And so here I am.\"\n\n\"And now that you are here,\" I said, \"have you not, among all these men\nfound one that you could love?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said, with a tremor in her voice, \"but they say I must.\"\n\n\"And how,\" I asked, \"do they enforce that rule? Does any one require\nyou--to accept the men?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied. \"I must do that--or starve.\"\n\n\"And how do you live now?\" I asked.\n\n\"They gave me money when I came here, a hundred marks. And they make me\npay to eat and when my money is gone I cannot eat unless I get more. And\nthe men have all the money, and they pay. They have offered to pay me,\nbut I refused to take their checks, and they think me stupid.\"\n\nThe child-like explanation of her lot touched the strings of my heart.\n\"And how long,\" I asked, \"is this money that is given you when you come\nhere supposed to last?\"\n\n\"Not more than twenty days,\" she answered.\n\n\"But you,\" I said, \"have been here thirty days!\"\n\nShe looked at me and smiled proudly. \"But I,\" she said, \"only eat one\nmeal a day. Do you not see how thin I am?\"\n\nThe realization that any one in this scientifically fed city could be\nhungry was to me appalling. Yet here was a girl living amidst luxurious\nbeauty, upon whom society was using the old argument of hunger to force\nher acceptance of the love of man.\n\nI rose and held out my hand. \"You shall eat again today,\" I said.\n\n\"I would rather not,\" she demurred. \"I have not yet accepted favours\nfrom any man.\"\n\n\"But you must. You are hungry,\" I protested. \"The problem of your\nexistence here cannot be put off much longer. We will go eat and then we\nwill try and find some solution.\"\n\nWithout further objection she walked with me. We found a secluded booth\nin a dining hall. I ordered the best dinner that Berlin had to offer.\n\nDuring the intervals of silence in our rather halting dinner\nconversation, I wrestled with the situation. I had desired to gain\ninsight into the lives of these girls. Yet now that the opportunity was\npresented I did not altogether relish the r\u00f4le in which it placed me.\nThe apparent innocence of the confiding girl seemed to open an easy way\nfor a personal conquest--and yet, perhaps because it was so obvious and\neasy, I rebelled at the unfairness of it. To rescue her, to aid her to\nescape--in a free world one might have considered these more obvious\nmoves, but here there was no place for her to escape to, no higher\nsocial justice to which appeal could be made. Either I must accept her\nas a personal responsibility, with what that might involve, or desert\nher to her fate. Both seemed cowardly--yet such were the horns of the\ndilemma and a choice must be made. Here at least was an opportunity to\nmake use of the funds that lay in the bank to the credit of the name I\nbore, and for which I had found so little use. So I decided to offer her\nmoney, and to insist that it was not offered as the purchase price\nof love.\n\n\"You must let me help you,\" I said, \"you must let me give you money.\"\n\n\"But I do not want your money,\" she replied. \"It would only postpone my\ntroubles. Even if I do accept your money, I would have to accept money\nfrom other men also, for you cannot pay for the whole of a\nwoman's living.\"\n\n\"Why not,\" I asked, \"does any rule forbid it?\"\n\n\"No rule, but can so young a man as you afford it?\"\n\n\"How much does it take for you to live here?\"\n\n\"About five marks a day.\"\n\nI glanced rather proudly at my insignia as a research chemist of the\nfirst rank. \"Do you know,\" I asked, \"how much income that\ninsignia carries?\"\n\n\"Well, no,\" she admitted, \"I know the income of military officers, but\nthere are so many of the professional ranks and classes that I get all\nmixed up.\"\n\n\"That means,\" I said, \"ten thousand marks a year.\"\n\n\"So much as that!\" she exclaimed in astonishment. \"And I can live here\non two hundred a month, but no, I did not mean that--you wouldn't,--I\ncouldn't--let you give me so much.\"\n\n\"Much!\" I exclaimed; \"you may have five hundred if you need it.\"\n\n\"You make love very nicely,\" she replied with aloofness.\n\n\"But I am not making love,\" I protested.\n\n\"Then why do you say these things? Do you prefer some one else? If so\nwhy waste your funds on me?\"\n\n\"No, no!\" I cried, \"it is not that; but you see I want to tell you\nthings; many things that you do not know. I want to see you often and\ntalk to you. I want to bring you books to read. And as for money, that\nis so you will not starve while you read my books and listen to me talk.\nBut you are to remain mistress of your own heart and your own person.\nYou see, I believe there are ways to win a woman's love far better than\nbuying her cheap when she is starved into selling in this\nbrutal fashion.\"\n\nShe looked at me dubiously. \"You are either very queer,\" she said, \"or\nelse a very great liar.\"\n\n\"But I am neither,\" I protested, piqued that the girl in her innocence\nshould yet brand me either mentally deficient or deceitful. \"It is\nimpossible to make you understand me,\" I went on, \"and yet you must\ntrust me. These other men, they approve the system under which you live,\nbut I do not. I offer you money, I insist on your taking it because\nthere is no other way, but it is not to force you to accept me but only\nto make it unnecessary for you to accept some one else. You have been\nvery brave, to stand out so long. You must accept my money now, but you\nneed never accept me at all--unless you really want me. If I am to make\nlove to you I want to make love to a woman who is really free; a woman\nfree to accept or reject love, not starved into accepting it in this\nso-called freedom.\"\n\n\"It is all very wonderful,\" she repeated; \"a minute ago I thought you\ndeceitful, and now I want to believe you. I can not stand out much\nlonger and what would be the use for just a few more days?\"\n\n\"There will be no need,\" I said gently, \"your courage has done its work\nwell--it has saved you for yourself. And now,\" I continued, \"we will\nbind this bargain before you again decide me crazy.\"\n\nTaking out my check book I filled in a check for two hundred marks\npayable to--\"To whom shall I make it payable?\" I asked.\n\n\"To Bertha, 34 R 6,\" she said, and thus I wrote it, cursing the\nprostituted science and the devils of autocracy that should give an\ninnocent girl a number like a convict in a jail or a mare in a breeder's\nherd book.\n\nAnd so I bought a German girl with a German check--bought her because I\nsaw no other way to save her from being lashed by starvation to the\nslave block and sold piecemeal to men in whom honour had not even died,\nbut had been strangled before it was born.\n\nWith my check neatly tucked in her bosom, Bertha walked out of the caf\u00e9\nclinging to my arm, and so, passing unheeding through the throng of\nindifferent revellers, we came to her apartment.\n\nAt the door I said, \"Tomorrow night I come again. Shall it be at the\ncaf\u00e9 or here?\"\n\n\"Here,\" she whispered, \"away from them all.\"\n\nI stooped and kissed her hand and then fled into the multitude.\n\n~3~\n\nI had promised Bertha that I would bring her books, but the narrow range\nof technical books permitted me were obviously unsuitable, nor did I\nfeel that the unspeakably morbid novels available on the Level of Free\nWomen would serve my purpose of awakening the girl to more wholesome\naspirations. In this emergency I decided to appeal to my\nfriend, Zimmern.\n\nLeaving the laboratory early, I made my way toward his apartment,\npuzzling my brain as to what kind of a book I could ask for that would\nbe at once suitable to Bertha's child-like mind and also be a volume\nwhich I could logically appear to wish to read myself. As I walked\nalong the answer flashed into my mind--I would ask for a geography\nof the outer world.\n\nHappily I found Zimmern in. \"I have come to ask,\" I said, \"if you could\nloan me a book of description of the outer world, one with maps, one\nthat tells all that is known of the land and seas and people.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" smiled Zimmern, \"you mean a geography. Your request,\" he\ncontinued, \"does me great honour. Books telling the truth about the\nworld without are very carefully guarded. I shall be pleased to get the\ngeography for you at once. In fact I had already decided that when you\ncame again I would take you with me to our little secret library.\nGermany is facing a great crisis, and I know no better way I can serve\nher than doing my part to help prepare as many as possible of our\nscientists to cope with the impending problems. Unless you chemists\navert it, we shall all live to see this outer world, or die that\nothers may.\"\n\nDr. Zimmern led the way to the elevator. We alighted on the Level of Free\nWomen. Instead of turning towards the halls of revelry we took our\ncourse in the opposite direction along the quiet streets among the\napartments of the women. We turned into a narrow passage-way and Dr.\nZimmern rang the bell at an apartment door. But after waiting a moment\nfor an answer he took a key from his pocket and unlocked the door.\n\n\"I am sorry Marguerite is out,\" he said, as he conducted me into a\nreception room. The walls were hung with seal-brown draperies. There\nwere richly upholstered chairs and a divan piled high with fluffy\npillows. In one corner stood a bookcase of burnished metal filigree.\n\nZimmern waved his hand at the case with an expression of disdain. \"Only\nthe conventional literature of the level, to keep up appearances,\" he\nsaid; \"our serious books are in here\"; and he thrust open the door of a\nroom which was evidently a young lady's boudoir.\n\nConscious of a profane intrusion, I followed Dr. Zimmern into the dainty\ndressing chamber. Stepping across the room he pushed open a spacious\nwardrobe, and thrusting aside a cleverly arranged shield of feminine\napparel he revealed, upon some improvised shelves, a library of perhaps\na hundred volumes. He ran his hand fondly along the bindings. \"No other\nman of your age in Berlin,\" he said, \"has ever had access to such a\ncomplete fund of knowledge as is in this library.\"\n\nI hope the old doctor took for appreciation the smile that played upon\nmy face as I contrasted his pitiful offering with the endless miles of\nbook stacks in the libraries of the outer world where I had spent so\nmany of my earlier days.\n\n\"Our books are safer here,\" said Zimmern, \"for no one would suspect a\ngirl on this level of being interested in serious reading. If perchance\nsome inspector did think to perform his neglected duties we trust to him\nbeing content to glance over the few novels in the case outside and not\nto pry into her wardrobe closet. There is still some risk, but that we\nmust take, since there is no absolute privacy anywhere. We must trust to\nchance to hide them in the place least likely to be searched.\"\n\n\"And how,\" I asked, \"are these books accumulated?\"\n\n\"It is the result of years of effort,\" explained Zimmern. \"There are\nonly a few of us who are in this secret group but all have contributed\nto the collection, and we come here to secure the books that the others\nbring. We prefer to read them here, and so avoid the chance of being\ndetected carrying forbidden books. There is no restriction on the\ncallers a girl may have at her apartment; the authorities of the level\nare content to keep records only of her monetary transactions, and that\nfact we take advantage of. Should a man's apartment on another level be\nso frequently visited by a group of men an inquiry would be made.\"\n\nAll this was interesting, but I inferred that I would again have\nopportunity to visit the library and now I was impatient to keep my\nappointment with Bertha. Making an excuse for haste, I asked Zimmern to\nget the geography for me. The stiff back of the book had been removed,\nand Zimmern helped me adjust the limp volume beneath my waistcoat.\n\n\"I am sorry you cannot remain and meet Marguerite tonight,\" he said as I\nstepped toward the door. \"But tomorrow evening I will arrange for you to\nmeet Colonel Hellar of the Information Staff, and Marguerite can be with\nus then. You may go directly to my booth in the caf\u00e9 where you last\ndined with me.\"\n\n~4~\n\nAfter a brief walk I came to Bertha's apartment, and nervously pressed\nthe bell. She opened the door stealthily and peered out, then\nrecognizing me, she flung it wide.\n\n\"I have brought you a book,\" I said as I entered; and, not knowing what\nelse to do, I went through the ridiculous operation of removing the\ngeography from beneath my waistcoat.\n\n\"What a big book,\" exclaimed Bertha in amazement. However, she did not\nopen the geography but laid it on the table, and stood staring at me\nwith her child-like blue eyes.\n\n\"Do you know,\" she said, \"that you are the first visitor I ever had in\nmy apartment? May I show you about?\"\n\nAs I followed her through the cosy rooms, I chafed to see the dainty\nluxury in which she was permitted to live while being left to starve.\nThe place was as well adapted to love-making as any other product\nof German science is adapted to its end. The walls were adorned\nwith sensual prints; but happily I recalled that Bertha, having\nno education in the matter, was immune to the insult.\n\nAnticipating my coming she had ordered dinner, and this was presently\ndelivered by a deaf-and-dumb mechanical servant, and we set it forth on\nthe dainty dining table. Since the world was young, I mused, woman and\nman had eaten a first meal together with all the world shut out, and so\nwe dined amid shy love and laughter in a tiny apartment in the heart of\na city where millions of men never saw the face of woman--and where\nmillions of babies were born out of love by the cold degree of science.\nAnd this same science, bartering with licentious iniquity, had provided\nthis refuge and permitted us to bar the door, and so we accepted our\nrefuge and sanctified it with the purity that was within our own\nhearts--such at least was my feeling at the time.\n\nAnd so we dined and cleared away, and talked joyfully of nothing. As the\nevening wore on Bertha, beside me upon the divan, snuggled contentedly\nagainst my shoulder. The nearness and warmth of her, and the innocence\nof her eyes thrilled yet maddened me.\n\nWith fast beating heart, I realized that I as well as Bertha was in the\ngrip of circumstances against which rebellion was as futile as were\nthoughts of escape. There was no one to aid and no one to forbid or\ncriticize. Whatever I might do to save her from the fate ordained for\nher would of necessity be worked out between us, unaided and unhampered\nby the ethics of civilization as I had known it in a freer, saner world.\n\nIn offering Bertha money and coming to her apartment I had thrust myself\nbetween her and the crass venality of the men of her race, but I had now\nto wrestle with the problem that such action had involved. If, I\nreasoned, I could only reveal to her my true identity the situation\nwould be easier, for I could then tell her of the rules of the game of\nlove in the world I had known. Until she knew of that world and its\nideals, how could I expect her to understand my motives? How else could\nI strengthen her in the battle against our own impulses?\n\nAnd yet, did I dare to confess to her that I was not a German? Would not\ndeep-seated ideals of patriotism drilled into the mind of a child place\nme in danger of betrayal at her hands? Such a move might place my own\nlife in jeopardy and also destroy my opportunity of being of service to\nthe world, could I contrive the means of escape from Berlin with the\nknowledge I had gained. Small though the possibilities of such escape\nmight be, it was too great a hope for me to risk for sentimental\nreasons. And could she be expected to believe so strange a tale?\n\nAnd so the temptation to confess that I was not Karl Armstadt passed,\nand with its passing, I recalled the geography that I had gone to so\nmuch trouble to secure, and which still lay unopened upon the table.\nHere at least was something to get us away from the tumultuous\nconsciousness of ourselves and I reached for the volume and spread it\nopen upon my knees.\n\n\"What a funny book!\" exclaimed Bertha, as she gazed at the round maps of\nthe two hemispheres. \"Of what is that a picture?\"\n\n\"The world,\" I answered.\n\nShe stared at me blankly. \"The Royal World?\" she asked.\n\n\"No, no,\" I replied. \"The world outside the walls of Berlin.\"\n\n\"The world in the sun,\" exclaimed Bertha, \"on the roof where they fight\nthe airplanes? A roof-guard officer\" she paused and bit her lip--\n\n\"The world of the inferior races,\" I suggested, trying to find some\ncommon footing with her pitifully scant knowledge.\n\n\"The world underground,\" she said, \"where the soldiers fight in the\nmines?\"\n\nBaffled in my efforts to define this world to her, I began turning the\npages of the geography, while Bertha looked at the pictures in\nchild-like wonder, and I tried as best I could to find simple\nexplanations.\n\nBetween the lines of my teaching, I scanned, as it were, the true state\nof German ignorance. Despite the evident intended authoritativeness of\nthe book--for it was marked \"Permitted to military staff officers\"--I\nfound it amusingly full of erroneous conceptions of the true state of\naffairs in the outer world.\n\nThis teaching of a child-like mind the rudiments of knowledge was an\namusing recreation, and so an hour passed pleasantly. Yet I realized\nthat this was an occupation of which I would soon tire, for it was not\nthe amusement of teaching a child that I craved, but the companionship\nof a woman of intelligence.\n\nAs we turned the last page I arose to take my departure. \"If I leave the\nbook with you,\" I said, \"will you read it all, very carefully? And then\nwhen I come again I will explain those things you can not understand.\"\n\n\"But it is so big, I couldn't read it in a day,\" replied Bertha, as she\nlooked at me appealingly.\n\nI steeled myself against that appeal. I wanted very much to get my mind\nback on my chemistry, and I wanted also to give her time to read and\nponder over the wonders of the great unknown world. Moreover, I no\nlonger felt so grievously concerned, for the calamity which had\novershadowed her had been for the while removed. And I had, too, my own\nstruggle to cherish her innocence, and that without the usual help\nextended by conventional society. So I made brave resolutions and\nexplained the urgency of my work and insisted that I could not see her\nfor five days.\n\nHungrily she pleaded for a quicker return; and I stubbornly resisted the\ntemptation. \"No,\" I insisted, \"not tomorrow, nor the next day, but I\nwill come back in three days at the same hour that I came tonight.\"\n\nThen taking her in my arms, I kissed her in feverish haste and tore\nmyself from the enthralling lure of her presence.\n\n~5~\n\nWhen I reached the caf\u00e9 the following evening to keep my appointment\nwith Zimmern, the waiter directed me to one of the small enclosed\nbooths. As I entered, closing the door after me, I found myself\nconfronting a young woman.\n\n\"Are you Col. Armstadt?\" she asked with a clear, vibrant voice. She\nsmiled cordially as she gave me her hand. \"I am Marguerite. Dr. Zimmern\nhas gone to bring Col. Hellar, and he asked me to entertain you until\nhis return.\"\n\nThe friendly candour of this greeting swept away the grey walls of\nBerlin, and I seemed again face to face with a woman of my own people.\nShe was a young woman of distinctive personality. Her features, though\ndelicately moulded, bespoke intelligence and strength of character that\nI had not hitherto seen in the women of Berlin. Framing her face was a\nluxuriant mass of wavy brown hair, which fell loosely about her\nshoulders. Her slender figure was draped in a cape of deep blue\ncellulose velvet.\n\n\"Dr. Zimmern tells me,\" I said as I seated myself across the table from\nher, \"that you are a dear friend of his.\"\n\nA swift light gleamed in her deep brown eyes. \"A very dear friend,\" she\nsaid feelingly, and then a shadow flitted across her face as she added,\n\"Without him life for me would be unbearable here.\"\n\n\"And how long, if I may ask, have you been here?\"\n\n\"About four years. Four years and six days, to be exact. I can keep\ncount you know,\" and she smiled whimsically, \"for I came on the day of\nmy birth, the day I was sixteen.\"\n\n\"That is the same for all, is it not?\"\n\n\"No one can come here before she is sixteen,\" replied Marguerite, \"and\nall must come before they are eighteen.\"\n\n\"But why did you come at the first opportunity?\" I asked, as I mentally\ncompared her confession with that of Bertha who had so courageously\npostponed as long as she could the day of surrender to this life of\nshamefully commercialized love.\n\n\"And why should I not come?\" returned Marguerite. \"I had a chance to\ncome, and I accepted it. Do you think life in the school for girls of\nforbidden birth is an enjoyable one?\"\n\nI wanted to press home the point of my argument, to proclaim my pride in\nBertha's more heroic struggle with the system, for this girl with whom I\nnow conversed was obviously a woman of superior intelligence, and it\nangered me to know that she had so easily surrendered to the life for\nwhich German society had ordained her. But I restrained my speech, for I\nrealized that in criticizing her way of life I would be criticizing her\nobvious relation to Zimmern, and like all men I found myself inclined to\nbe indulgent with the personal life of a man who was my friend.\nMoreover, I perceived the presumptuousness of assuming a superior air\ntowards an established and accepted institution. Yet, strive as I might\nto be tolerant, I felt a growing antagonism towards this attractive and\ncultured girl who had surrendered without a struggle to a life that to\nme was a career of shame--and who seemed quite content with her\nsurrender.\n\n\"Do you like it here?\" I asked, knowing that my question was stupid, but\nanxious to avoid a painful gap in what was becoming, for me, a difficult\nconversation.\n\nMarguerite looked at me with a queer penetrating gaze. \"Do I like it\nhere?\" she repeated. \"Why should you ask, and how can I answer? Can I\nlike it or not like it, when there was no choice for me? Can I push out\nthe walls of Berlin?\"--and she thrust mockingly into the air with a\ndelicately chiselled hand--\"It is a prison. All life is a prison.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"it is a prison, but life on this level is more joyful\nthan on many others.\"\n\nHer lip curled in delicate scorn. \"For you men--of course--and I suppose\nit is for these women too--perhaps that is why I hate it so, because\nthey do enjoy it, they do accept it. They sell their love for food and\nraiment, and not one in all these millions seems to mind it.\"\n\n\"In that,\" I remarked, \"perhaps you are mistaken. I have not come here\noften as most men do, but I have found one other who, like you, rebels\nat the system--who in fact, was starving because she would not sell\nher love.\"\n\nMarguerite flashed on me a look of pitying suspicion as she asked: \"Have\nyou gone to the Place of Records to look up this rebel against the\nsale of love?\"\n\nA fire of resentment blazed up in me at this question. I did not know\njust what she meant by the Place of Records, but I felt that this woman\nwho spoke cynically of rebellion against the sale of love, and yet who\nhad obviously sold her love to an old man, was in no position to\ndiscredit a weaker woman's nobler fight.\n\n\"What right,\" I asked coldly, \"have you to criticize another whom you do\nnot know?\"\n\n\"I am sorry,\" replied Marguerite, \"if I seem to quarrel with you when I\nwas left here to entertain you, but I could not help it--it angers me to\nhave you men be so fond of being deceived, such easy prey to this\nthreadbare story of the girl who claims she never came here until forced\nto do so. But men love to believe it. The girls learn to use the story\nbecause it pays.\"\n\nA surge of conflicting emotion swept through me as I recalled the\nchild-like innocence of Bertha and compared it with the critical\nscepticism of this superior woman. \"It only goes to show,\" I thought,\n\"what such a system can do to destroy a woman's faith in the very\nexistence of innocence and virtue.\"\n\nMarguerite did not speak; her silence seemed to say: \"You do not\nunderstand, nor can I explain--I am simply here and so are you, and we\nhave our secrets which cannot be committed to words.\"\n\nWith idle fingers she drummed lightly on the table. I watched those\nslender fingers and the rhythmic play of the delicate muscles of the\nbare white arm that protruded from the rich folds of the blue velvet\ncape. Then my gaze lifted to her face. Her downcast eyes were shielded\nby long curving lashes; high arched silken brows showed dark against a\nskin as fresh and free from chemist's pigment as the petal of a rose. In\nexultant rapture my heart within me cried that here was something fine\nof fibre, a fineness which ran true to the depths of her soul.\n\nIn my discovery of Bertha's innocence and in my faith in her purity and\ncourage I had hoped to find relief from the spiritual loneliness that\nhad grown upon me during my sojourn in this materialistic city. But that\nfaith was shaken, as the impression Bertha had made upon my\nover-sensitized emotions, now dimmed by a brighter light, flickered pale\non the screen of memory. The mere curiosity and pity I had felt for a\nchance victim singled out among thousands by the legend of innocence on\na pretty face could not stand against the force that now drew me to this\nwoman who seemed to be not of a slavish race--even as Dr. Zimmern seemed\na man apart from the soulless product of the science he directed. But as\nI acknowledged this new magnet tugging at the needle of my floundering\nheart, I also realized that my friendship for the lovable and courageous\nZimmern reared an unassailable barrier to shut me into outer darkness.\n\nThe thought proved the harbinger of the reality, for Dr. Zimmerman\nhimself now entered. He was accompanied by Col. Hellar of the\nInformation Staff, a man of about Zimmern's age. Col. Hellar bore\nhimself with a gracious dignity; his face was sad, yet there gleamed\nfrom his eye a kindly humor.\n\nMarguerite, after exchanging a few pleasantries with Col. Hellar and\nmyself, tenderly kissed the old doctor on the forehead, and slipped out.\n\n\"You shall see much of her,\" said Zimmern, \"she is the heart and fire of\nour little group, the force that holds us together. But tonight I asked\nher not to remain\"--the old doctor's eyes twinkled with merriment,--\"for\na young man cannot get acquainted with a beautiful woman and with ideas\nat the same time.\"\n\n~6~\n\n\"And now,\" said Zimmern, after we had finished our dinner, \"I want Col.\nHellar to tell you more of the workings of the Information Service.\"\n\n\"It is a very complex system,\" began Hellar. \"It is old. Its history\ngoes back to the First World War, when the military censorship began by\nsuppressing information thought to be dangerous and circulating\nfictitious reports for patriotic purposes. Now all is much more\nelaborately organized; we provide that every child be taught only the\nthings that it is decided he needs to know, and nothing more. Have you\nseen the bulletins and picture screens in the quarters for the workers?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied, \"but the lines were all in old German type.\"\n\n\"And that,\" said Hellar, \"is all that the workers and soldiers can read.\nThe modern type could be taught them in a few days, but we see to it\nthat they have no opportunity to learn it. As it is now, should they\nfind or steal a forbidden book, they cannot read it.\"\n\n\"But is it not true,\" I asked, \"that at one time the German workers were\nmost thoroughly educated?\"\n\n\"It is true,\" said Hellar, \"and because of that universal education\nGermany was defeated in the First World War. The English contaminated\nthe soldiers by flooding the trenches with democratic literature dropped\nfrom airplanes. Then came the Bolshevist regime in Russia with its\npassion for revolutionary propaganda. The working men and soldiers read\nthis disloyal literature and they forced the abdication of William the\nGreat. It was because of this that his great grandson, when the House of\nHohenzollern was restored to the throne, decided to curtail universal\neducation.\n\n\"But while William III curtailed general education he increased the\nspecialized education and established the Information Staff to supervise\nthe dissemination of all knowledge.\"\n\n\"It is an atrocious system,\" broke in Zimmern, \"but if we had not\nabolished the family, curtailed knowledge and bred soldiers and\nworkers from special non-intellectual strains this sunless world of\nours could not have endured.\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" said Hellar, \"whether we approve of it or not certainly\nthere was no other way to accomplish the end sought. By no other plan\ncould German isolation have been maintained.\"\n\n\"But why was isolation deemed desirable?\" I enquired.\n\n\"Because,\" said Zimmern, \"it was that or extermination. Even now we who\nwish to put an end to this isolation, we few who want to see the world\nas our ancestors saw it, know that the price may be annihilation.\"\n\n\"So,\" repeated Hellar, \"so annihilation for Germany, but better so--and\nyet I go on as Director of Information; Dr. Zimmern goes on as Chief\nEugenist; and you go on seeking to increase the food supply, and so we\nall go on as part of the diabolic system, because as individuals we\ncannot destroy it, but must go on or be destroyed by it. We have riches\nhere and privileges. We keep the labourers subdued below us, Royalty\nenthroned above us, and the World State at bay about us, all by this\nscience and system which only we few intellectuals understand and which\nwe keep going because we can not stop it without being destroyed by\nthe effort.\"\n\n\"But we shall stop it,\" declared Zimmern, \"we must stop it--with\nArmstadt's help we can stop it. You and I, Hellar, are mere cogs; if we\nbreak others can take our places, but Armstadt has power. What he knows\nno one else knows. He has power. We have only weakness because others\ncan take our place. And because he has power let us help him find\na way.\"\n\n\"It seems to me,\" I said, \"that the way must be by education. More men\nmust think as we do.\"\n\n\"But they can not think,\" replied Hellar, \"they have nothing to\nthink with.\"\n\n\"But the books,\" I said, \"there is power in knowledge.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Hellar, \"the labourer can not read the forbidden book and\nthe intellectual will not, for if he did he would be afraid to talk\nabout it, and what a man can not talk about he rarely cares to read. The\nlove or hatred of knowledge is a matter of training. It was only last\nweek that I was visiting a boy's school in order to study the effect of\na new reader of which complaint had been made that it failed\nsufficiently to exalt the virtue of obedience. I was talking with the\nteacher while the boys assembled in the morning. We heard a great\ncommotion and a mob of boys came in dragging one of their companions who\nhad a bruised face and torn clothing. \"Master, he had a forbidden book,\"\nthey shouted, and the foremost held out the tattered volume as if it\nwere loathsome poison. It proved to be a text on cellulose spinning.\nWhere the culprit had found it we could not discover but he was sent to\nthe school prison and the other boys were given favours for\napprehending him.\"\n\n\"But how is it,\" I asked, \"that books are not written by free-minded\nauthors and secretly printed and circulated?\"\n\nAt this question my companions smiled. \"You chemists forget,\" said\nHellar, \"that it takes printing presses to make books. There is no press\nin all Berlin except in the shops of the Information Staff. Every paper,\nevery book, and every picture originates and is printed there. Every\nnews and book distributor must get his stock from us and knows that he\nmust have only in his possession that which bears the imprint for his\nlevel. That is why we have no public libraries and no trade in\nsecond-hand books.\n\n\"In early life I favoured this system, but in time the foolishness of\nthe thing came to perplex, then to annoy, and finally to disgust me. But\nI wanted the money and honour that promotion brought and so I have won\nto my position and power; with my right hand I uphold the system and\nwith my left hand I seek to pull out the props on which it rests. For\ntwenty years now I have nursed the secret traffic in books and risked my\nlife many times thereby, yet my successes have been few and scattered.\nEvery time the auditors check my stock and accounts I tremble in fear,\nfor embezzling books is more dangerous than embezzling credit at\nthe bank.\"\n\n\"But who,\" I asked, \"write the books?\"\n\n\"For the technical books it is not hard to find authors,\" explained\nHellar, \"for any man well schooled in his work can write of it. But the\ntask of getting the more general books written is not so easy. For then\nit is not so much a question of the author knowing the things of which\nhe writes but of knowing what the various groups are to be permitted\nto know.\n\n\"That writing is done exclusively by especially trained workers of the\nInformation Service. I myself began as such a writer and studied long\nunder the older masters. The school of scientific lying, I called it,\nbut strange to say I used to enjoy such work and did it remarkably well.\nAs recognition of my ability I was commissioned to write the book 'God's\nAnointed.' Through His Majesty's approval of my work I now owe my\nposition on the Staff.\n\n\"His Majesty,\" continued Hellar, \"was only twenty-six years of age when\nhe came to the throne, but he decided at once that a new religious book\nshould be written in which he would be proclaimed as 'God's Anointed\nruler of the World.'\n\n\"I had never before spoken with the high members of the Royal House, and\nI was trembling with eagerness and fear as I was ushered into His\nMajesty's presence. The Emperor sat at his great black table; before him\nwas an old book. He turned to me and said, 'Have you ever heard of the\nChristian Bible?'\n\n\"My Chief had informed me that the new book was to be based on the old\nBible that the Christians had received from the Hebrews. So I said,\n'Yes, Your Majesty, I am familiar with many of its words.'\n\n\"He looked at me with a gloating suspicion. 'Ah, ha,' he said, 'then\nthere is something amiss in the Information Service--you are in the\nthird rank of your service and the Bible is permitted only to the\nfirst rank.'\n\n\"I saw that my statement unless modified would result in an embarrassing\ninvestigation. 'I have never read the Christian Bible,' I said, 'but my\nmother must have read it for when as a child I visited her she quoted to\nme long passages from the Bible.'\n\n\"His Majesty smiled in a pleased fashion. 'That is it,' he said, 'women\nare essentially religious by nature, because they are trusting and\nobedient. It was a mistake to attempt to stamp out religion. It is the\ndoctrine of obedience. Therefore I shall revive religion, but it shall\nbe a religion of obedience to the House of Hohenzollern. The God of the\nHebrews declared them to be his chosen people. But they proved a servile\nand mercenary race. They traded their swords for shekels and became a\nbyword and a hissing among the nations--and they were scattered to the\nfour corners of the earth. I shall revive that God. And this time he\nshall chose more wisely, for the Germans shall be his people. The idea\nis not mine. William the Great had that idea, but the revolution swept\nit away. It shall be revived. We shall have a new Bible, based upon the\nold one, a third dispensation, to replace the work of Moses and Jesus.\nAnd I too shall be a lawgiver--I shall speak the word of God.'\"\n\nHellar paused; a smile crept over his face. Then he laughed softly and\nto himself--but Dr. Zimmern only shook his head sadly.\n\n\"Yes, I wrote the book,\" continued Hellar. \"It required four years, for\nHis Majesty was very critical, and did much revising. I had a long\nargument with him over the question of retaining Hell. I was bitterly\nopposed to it and represented to His Majesty that no religion had ever\nthrived on fear of punishment without a corresponding hope of reward.\n'If you are to have no Heaven,' I insisted, 'then you must have\nno Hell.'\n\n\"'But we do not need Heaven,' argued His Majesty, 'Heaven is\nsuperfluous. It is an insult to my reign. Is it not enough that a man is\na German, and may serve the House of Hohenzollern?'\n\n\"'Then why,' I asked, 'do you need a Hell?' I should have been shot for\nthat but His Majesty did not see the implication. He replied coolly:\n\n\"'We must have a Hell because there is one way that my subjects can\nescape me. It is a sin of our race that the Eugenics Office should have\nbred out--but they have failed. It is an inborn sin for it is chiefly\ncommitted by our children before they come to comprehend the glory of\nbeing German. How else, if you do not have a Hell in your religion, can\nyou check suicide?'\n\n\"Of course there was logic in his contention and so I gave in and made\nthe Children's Hell. It is a gruesome doctrine, that a child who kills\nhimself does not really die. It is the one thing in the whole book that\nmakes me feel most intellectually unclean for writing it. But I wrote it\nand when the book was finished and His Majesty had signed the\nmanuscript, for the first time in over a century we printed a bible on a\nGerman press. The press where the first run was made we named 'Old\nGutenberg.'\"\n\n\"Gutenberg invented the printing press,\" explained Zimmern, fearing I\nmight not comprehend.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Hellar with a curling lip, \"and Gutenberg was a German, and\nso am I. He printed a Bible which he believed, and I wrote one which I\ndo not believe.\"\n\n\"But I am glad,\" concluded Hellar as he arose, \"that I do not believe\nGutenberg's Bible either, for I should very much dislike to think of\nmeeting him in Paradise.\"\n\n~7~\n\nAfter taking leave of my companions I walked on alone, oblivious to the\ngay throng, for I had many things on which to ponder. In these two men I\nfelt that I had found heroic figures. Their fund of knowledge, which\nthey prized so highly, seemed to me pitifully circumscribed and limited,\ntheir revolutionary plans hopelessly vague and futile. But the\nintellectual stature of a man is measured in terms of the average of his\nrace, and, thus viewed, Zimmern and Hellar were intellectual giants of\nheroic proportions.\n\nAs I walked through a street of shops. I paused before the display\nwindow of a bookstore of the level. Most of these books I had previously\ndiscovered were lurid-titled tales of licentious love. But among them I\nnow saw a volume bearing the title \"God's Anointed,\" and recalled that I\nhad seen it before and assumed it to be but another like its fellows.\n\nEntering the store I secured a copy and, impatient to inspect my\npurchase, I bent my steps to my favourite retreat in the nearby Hall of\nFlowers. In a secluded niche near the misty fountain I began a hasty\nperusal of this imperially inspired word of God who had anointed the\nHohenzollerns masters of the earth. Hellar's description had prepared me\nfor a preposterous and absurd work, but I had not anticipated anything\nquite so audacious could be presented to a race of civilized men, much\nless that they could have accepted it in good faith as the Germans\nevidently did.\n\n\"God's Anointed,\" as Hellar had scoffingly inferred, not only proclaimed\nthe Germans as the chosen race, but also proclaimed an actual divinity\nof the blood of the House of Hohenzollern. That William II did have some\nsuch notions in his egomania I believe is recorded in authentic history.\nBut the way Eitel I had adapted that faith to the rather depressing\nfacts of the failure of world conquest would have been extremely comical\nto me, had I not seen ample evidence of the colossal effect of such a\nfaith working in the credulous child-mind of a people so utterly devoid\nof any saving sense of humour.\n\nNot unfamiliar with the history of the temporal reign of the Popes of\nthe middle ages, I could readily comprehend the practical efficiency of\nsuch a mixture of religious faith with the affairs of earth. For the God\nof the German theology exacted no spiritual worship of his people, but\nonly a very temporal service to the deity's earthly incarnation in the\nform of the House of Hohenzollern.\n\nThe greatest virtue, according to this mundane theology, was obedience,\nand this doctrine was closely interwoven with the caste system of German\nsociety. The virtue of obedience required the German to renounce\ndiscontent with his station, and to accept not only the material status\ninto which he was born, with science aforethought, but the intellectual\nlimits and horizons of that status. The old Christian doctrine of heresy\nwas broadened to encompass the entire mental life. To think forbidden\nthoughts, to search after forbidden knowledge, that was at once treason\nagainst the Royal House and rebellion against the divine plan.\n\nGerman theology, confounding divine and human laws, permitted no dual\noverlapping spheres of mundane and celestial rule as had all previous\nreligious and, social orders since Christ had commanded his disciples to\n\"Render unto Caesar--\" There could be no conscientious objection to\nGerman law on religious grounds; no problem of church and state, for the\nchurch was the state.\n\nIn this book that masqueraded as the word of God, I looked in vain for\nsome revelation of future life. But it was essentially a one-world\ntheology; the most immortal thing was the Royal House for which the\nworker was asked to slave, the soldier to die that Germany might be\nruled by the Hohenzollerns and that the Hohenzollerns might sometime\nrule the world.\n\nAs the freedom of conscience and the institution of marriage had been\ndiscarded so this German faith had scrapped the immortality of the soul,\nsave for the single incongruous doctrine that a child taking his own\nlife does not die but lives on in ceaseless torment in a ghoulish\nChildren's Hell.\n\nAs I closed the cursed volume my mind called up a picture of Teutonic\nhordes pouring from the forests of the North and blotting out what\nGreece and Rome had builded. From thence my roving fancy tripped over\nthe centuries and lived again with men who cannot die. I stood with\nLuther at the Diet of Worms. With Kant I sounded the deeps of\nphilosophy. I sailed with Humboldt athwart uncharted seas. I fought with\nGoethe for the redemption of a soul sold to the Devil. And with Schubert\nand Heine I sang:\n\n  _Du bist wie eine Blume,\n  So hold und schoen und rein,_\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n  _Betend dass Gott dich erhalte,\n  So rein und schoen und hold._\n\nBut what a cankerous end was here. This people which the world had once\nloved and honoured was now bred a beast of burden, a domesticated race,\nsaddled and trained to bear upon its back the House of Hohenzollern as\nthe ass bore Balaam. But the German ass wore the blinders that science\nhad made--and saw no angel.\n\n~8~\n\nAs I sat musing thus and gazing into the spray of the fountain I\nglimpsed a grey clad figure, standing in the shadows of a viney bower.\nAlthough I could not distinguish her face through the leafy tracery I\nknew that it was Bertha, and my heart thrilled to think that she had\nreturned to the site of our meeting. Thoroughly ashamed of the faithless\ndoubts that I had so recently entertained of her innocence and\nsincerity, I arose and hastened toward her. But in making the detour\nabout the pool I lost sight of the grey figure, for she was standing\nwell back in the arbour. As I approached the place where I had seen her\nI came upon two lovers standing with arms entwined in the path at the\npool's edge. Not wishing to disturb them, I turned back through one of\nthe arbours and approached by another path. As I slipped noiselessly\nalong in my felt-soled shoes I heard Bertha's voice, and quite near,\nthrough the leafy tracery, I glimpsed the grey of her gown.\n\n\"Why with your beauty,\" came the answering voice of a man, \"did you not\nfind a lover from the Royal Level?\"\n\n\"Because,\" Bertha's voice replied, \"I would not accept them. I could not\nlove them. I could not give myself without love.\"\n\n\"But surely,\" insisted the man, \"you have found a lover here?\"\n\n\"But I have not,\" protested the innocent voice, \"because I have sought\nnone.\"\n\n\"Now long have you been here?\" bluntly asked the man.\n\n\"Thirty days,\" replied the girl.\n\n\"Then you must have found a lover, your d\u00e9but fund would all be gone.\"\n\n\"But,\" cried Bertha, in a tearful voice, \"I only eat one meal a day--do\nyou not see how thin I am?\"\n\n\"Now that's clever,\" rejoined the man, \"come, I'll accept it for what it\nis worth, and look you up afterwards,\" and he laughingly led her away,\nleaving me undiscovered in the neighbouring arbour to pass judgment on\nmy own simplicity.\n\nAs I walked toward the elevator, I was painfully conscious of two ideas.\nOne was that Marguerite had been quite correct with her information\nabout the free women who found it profitable to play the r\u00f4le of\nmaidenly innocence. The other was that Dr. Zimmern's precious geography\nwas in the hands of the artful, child-eyed hypocrite who had so cleverly\nbeguiled me with her r\u00f4le of heroic virtue. Clearly, I was trapped, and\nto judge better with what I had to deal I decided to go at once to the\nPlace of Records, of which I had twice heard.\n\nThe Place of Records proved to be a public directory of the financial\nstatus of the free women. Since the physical plagues that are propagated\nby promiscuous love had been completely exterminated, and since there\nwere no moral standards to preserve, there was no need of other\nrestrictions on the lives of the women than an economic one.\n\nThe rules of the level were prominently posted. As all consequential\nmoney exchanges were made through bank checks, the keeping of the\nrecords was an easy matter. These rules I found forbade any woman to\ncash checks in excess of one thousand marks a month, or in excess of two\nhundred marks from any one man. That was simple enough, and I smiled as\nI recalled that I had gone the legal limit in my first adventure.\n\nFollowing the example of other men, I stepped to the window and gave the\nname: \"Bertha 34 R 6.\" A clerk brought me a book opened to the page of\nher record. At the top of the page was entered this statement, \"Bred for\nan actress but rejected for both professional work and maternity because\nfound devoid of sympathetic emotions.\" I laughed as I read this, but\nwhen on the next line I saw from the date of her entrance to the level\nthat Bertha's thirty days was in reality nearly three years, my mirth\nturned to anger. I looked down the list of entries and found that for\nsome time she had been cashing each month the maximum figure of a\nthousand marks. Evidently her little scheme of pensive posing in the\nHall of Flowers was working nicely. In the current month, hardly half\ngone, she already had to her credit seven hundred marks; and last on the\nlist was my own contribution, freshly entered.\n\n\"She has three hundred marks yet,\" commented the clerk.\n\n\"Yes, I see,\"--and I turned to go. But I paused and stepped again to the\nwindow. \"There is another girl I would like to look up,\" I said, \"but I\nhave only her name and no number.\"\n\n\"Do you know the date of her arrival?\" asked the clerk.\n\n\"Yes, she has been here four years and six days. The name is\nMarguerite.\"\n\nThe clerk walked over to a card file and after some searching brought\nback a slip with half a dozen numbers. \"Try these,\" he said, and he\nbrought me the volumes. The second record I inspected read: \"Marguerite,\n78 K 4, Love-child.\" On the page below was a single entry for each\nmonth of two hundred marks and every entry from the first was in the\nname of Ludwig Zimmern.\n\n~9~\n\nI kept my appointment with Bertha, but found it difficult to hide my\nanger as she greeted me. Wishing to get the interview over, I asked\nabruptly, \"Have you read the book I left?\"\n\n\"Not all of it,\" she replied, \"I found it rather dull.\"\n\n\"Then perhaps I had better take it with me.\"\n\n\"But I think I shall keep it awhile,\" she demurred.\n\n\"No,\" I insisted, as I looked about and failed to see the geography, \"I\nwish you would get it for me. I want to take it back, in fact it was a\nborrowed book.\"\n\n\"Most likely,\" she smiled archly, \"but since you are not a staff\nofficer, and had no right to have that book, you might as well know that\nyou will get it when I please to give it to you.\"\n\nSeeing that she was thoroughly aware of my predicament, I grew\nfrightened and my anger slipped from its moorings. \"See here,\" I cried,\n\"your little story of innocence and virtue is very clever, but I've\nlooked you up and--\"\n\n\"And what--,\" she asked, while through her child-like mask the subtle\ntrickery of her nature mocked me with a look of triumph--\"and what do\nyou propose to do about it?\"\n\nI realized the futility of my rage. \"I shall do nothing. I ask only that\nyou return the book.\"\n\n\"But books are so valuable,\" taunted Bertha.\n\nDejectedly I sank to the couch. She came over and sat on a cushion at my\nfeet. \"Really Karl,\" she purred, \"you should not be angry. If I insist\non keeping your book it is merely to be sure that you will not forget\nme. I rather like you; you are so queer and talk such odd things. Did\nyou learn your strange ways of making love from the book about the\ninferior races in the world outside the walls? I really tried to read\nsome of it, but I could not understand half the words.\"\n\nI rose and strode about the room. \"Will you get me the book?\" I\ndemanded.\n\n\"And lose you?\"\n\n\"Well, what of it? You can get plenty more fools like me.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I would have to stand and stare into that fountain for hours\nat a time. It is very tiresome.\"\n\n\"Just what do you want?\" I asked, trying to speak calmly.\n\n\"Why you,\" she said, placing her slender white hands upon my arm, and\nholding up an inviting face.\n\nBut anger at my own gullibility had killed her power to draw me, and I\nshook her off. \"I want that book,\" I said coldly, \"what are your terms?\"\nAnd I drew my check book from my pocket.\n\n\"How many blanks have you there?\" she asked with a greedy light in her\neyes--\"but never mind to count them. Make them all out to me at two\nhundred marks, and date each one a month ahead.\"\n\nRealizing that any further exhibition of fear or anger would put me more\nwithin her power, I sat down and began to write the checks. The fund I\nwas making over to her was quite useless to me but when I had made out\ntwenty checks I stopped. \"Now,\" I said, \"this is enough. You take these\nor nothing.\" Tearing out the written checks I held them toward her.\n\nAs she reached out her hand I drew them back--\"Go get the book,\" I\ndemanded.\n\n\"But you are unfair,\" said Bertha, \"you are the stronger. You can take\nthe book from me. I cannot take the checks from you.\"\n\n\"That is so,\" I admitted, and handed the checks to her. She looked at\nthem carefully and slipped them into her bosom, and then, reaching under\nthe pile of silken pillows, she pulled forth the geography.\n\nI seized it and turned toward the door, but she caught my arm. \"Don't,\"\nshe pleaded, \"don't go. Don't be angry with me. Why should you dislike\nme? I've only played my part as you men make it for us--but I do not\nwant your money for nothing. You liked me when you thought me innocent.\nWhy hate me when you find that I am clever?\"\n\nAgain those slender arms stole around my neck, and the entrancing face\nwas raised to mine. But the vision of a finer, nobler face rose before\nme, and I pushed away the clinging arms. \"I'm sorry,\" I said, \"I am\ngoing now--going back to my work and forget you. It is not your fault.\nYou are only what Germany has made you--but,\" I added with a smile, \"if\nyou must go to the Hall of Flowers, please do not wear that grey gown.\"\n\nShe stood very still as I edged toward the door, and the look of baffled\nchild-like innocence crept back into her eyes, a real innocence this\ntime of things she did not know, and could not understand.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nTHE SUN SHINES UPON A KING AND A GIRL READS OF THE FALL OF BABYLON\n\n\n~1~\n\nEmbittered by this unhappy ending of my romance, I turned to my work\nwith savage zeal, determined not again to be diverted by a personal\neffort to save the Germans from their sins. But this application to my\ntest-tubes was presently interrupted by a German holiday which was known\nas The Day of the Sun.\n\nFrom the conversation of my assistants I gathered that this was an\nannual occasion of particular importance. It was, in fact, His Majesty's\nbirthday, and was celebrated by permitting the favoured classes to see\nthe ruler himself at the Place in the Sun. For this Royal exhibition I\nreceived a blue ticket of which my assistants were curiously envious.\nThey inspected the number of it and the hour of my admittance to the\nRoyal Level. \"It is the first appearance of the day,\" they said. \"His\nMajesty will be fresh to speak; you will be near; you will be able to\nsee His Face without the aid of a glass; you will be able to hear His\nVoice, and not merely the reproducing horns.\"\n\nIn the morning our news bulletin was wholly devoted to announcements and\npatriotic exuberances. Across the sheet was flamed a headline stating\nthat the meteorologist of the Roof Observatory reported that the sun\nwould shine in full brilliancy upon the throne. This seemed very\npuzzling to me. For the Place in the Sun was clearly located on the\nRoyal Level and some hundred metres beneath the roof of the city.\n\nI went, at the hour announced on my ticket, to the indicated elevator;\nand, with an eager crowd of fellow scientists, stepped forth into a vast\nopen space where the vaulted ceiling was supported by massive fluted\ncolumns that rose to twice the height of the ordinary spacing of the\nlevels of the city.\n\nAn enormous crowd of men of the higher ranks was gathering. Closely\npacked and standing, the multitude extended to the sides and the rear of\nmy position for many hundred metres until it seemed quite lost under the\nglowing lights in the distance. Before us a huge curtain hung.\nEmblazoned on its dull crimson background of subdued socialism was a\ngigantic black eagle, the leering emblem of autocracy. Above and\nextending back over us, appeared in the ceiling a deep and\nunlighted crevice.\n\nAs the crowd seemed complete the men about me consulted their watches\nand then suddenly grew quiet in expectancy. The lights blinked twice and\nwent out, and we were bathed in a hush of darkness. The heavy curtain\nrustled like the mantle of Jove while from somewhere above I heard the\nshutters of the windows of heaven move heavily on their rollers. A\nflashing brilliant beam of light shot through the blackness and fell in\nwondrous splendour upon a dazzling metallic dais, whereon rested the\ngilded throne of the House of Hohenzollern.\n\nSeated upon the throne was a man--a very little man he seemed amidst\nsuch vast and vivid surroundings. He was robed in a cape of dazzling\nwhite, and on his head he wore a helmet of burnished platinum. Before\nthe throne and slightly to one side stood the round form of a\npaper globe.\n\nHis Majesty rose, stepped a few paces forward; and, as he with solemn\ndeliberation raised his hand into the shaft of burning light, from the\nthrong there came a frenzied shouting, which soon changed into a sort of\nchanting and then into a throaty song.\n\nHis Majesty lowered his hand; the song ceased; a great stillness hung\nover the multitude. Eitel I, Emperor of the Germans, now raised his face\nand stared for a moment unblinkingly into the beam of sunlight, then he\nlowered his gaze toward the sea of upturned faces.\n\n\"My people,\" he said, in a voice which for all his pompous effort, fell\nrather flat in the immensity, \"you are assembled here in the Place of\nthe Sun to do honour to God's anointed ruler of the world.\"\n\nFrom ten thousand throats came forth another raucous shout.\n\n\"Two and a half centuries ago,\" now spoke His Majesty, \"God appointed\nthe German race, under William the Great, of the House of Hohenzollern,\nto be the rulers of the world.\n\n\"For nineteen hundred years, God in his infinite patience, had awaited\nthe outcome of the test of the Nazarene's doctrine of servile humility\nand effeminate peace. But the Christian nations of the earth were\nweighed in the balance of Divine wrath and found wanting. Wallowing in\nhypocrisy and ignorance, wanting in courage and valour; behind a\npretence of altruism they cloaked their selfish greed for gold.\n\n\"Of all the people of the earth our race alone possessed the two keys to\npower, the mastery of science and the mastery of the sword. So the\nGermans were called of God to instil fear and reverence into the hearts\nof the inferior races. That was the purpose of the First World War under\nmy noble ancestor, William II.\n\n\"But the envious nations, desperate in their greed, banded together to\ndefy our old German God, and destroy His chosen people. But this was\nonly a divine trial of our worth, for the plans of God are for eternity.\nHis days to us are centuries. And we did well to patiently abide the\ncomplete unfoldment of the Divine plan.\n\n\"Before two generations had passed our German ancestors cast off the\nyoke of enslavement and routed the oppressors in the Second World War.\nLest His chosen race be contaminated by the swinish herds of the mongrel\nnations God called upon His people to relinquish for a time the fruits\nof conquest, that they might be further purged by science and become a\npure-bred race of super-men.\n\n\"That purification has been accomplished for every German is bred and\ntrained by science as ordained by God. There are no longer any mongrels\namong the men of Germany, for every one of you is created for his\nspecial purpose and every German is fitted for his particular place as a\nmember of the super-race.\n\n\"The time now draws near when the final purpose of our good old German\nGod is to be fulfilled. The day of this fulfilment is known unto me. The\nsun which shines upon this throne is but a symbol of that which has been\ndenied you while all these things were being made ready. But now the day\ndraws near when you shall, under my leadership, rule over the world and\nthe mongrel peoples. And to each of you shall be given a place in\nthe sun.\"\n\nThe voice had ceased. A great stillness hung over the multitude. Eitel\nI, Emperor of the Germans, threw back his cape and drew his sword. With\na sweeping flourish he slashed the paper globe in twain.\n\nFrom the myriad throated throng came a reverberating shout that rolled\nand echoed through the vaulted catacomb. The crimson curtain dropped.\nThe shutters were thrown athwart the reflected beam of sunlight. The\nlights of man again glowed pale amidst the maze of columns.\n\nSinging and marching, the men filed toward the elevators. The guards\nurged haste to clear the way, for the God of the Germans could not stay\nthe march of the sun across the roof of Berlin, and a score of paper\nglobes must yet be slashed for other shouting multitudes before the\nsun's last gleam be twisted down to shine upon a king.\n\n~2~\n\nAlthough the working hours of the day were scarcely one-fourth gone, it\nwas impossible for me to return to my laboratory for the lighting\ncurrent was shut off for the day. I therefore decided to utilize the\noccasion by returning the geography which I had rescued from Bertha.\n\nDr. Zimmern's invitation to make use of his library had been cordial\nenough, but its location in Marguerite's apartment had made me a little\nreticent about going there except in the Doctor's company. Yet I did not\nwish to admit to Zimmern my sensitiveness in the matter--and the\ngeography had been kept overlong.\n\nThis occasion being a holiday, I found the resorts on the Level of Free\nWomen crowded with merrymakers. But I sought the quieter side streets\nand made my way towards Marguerite's apartment.\n\n\"I thought you would be celebrating today,\" she said as I entered.\n\n\"I feel that I can utilize the time better by reading,\" I replied.\n\"There is so much I want to learn, and, thanks to Dr. Zimmern, I now\nhave the opportunity.\"\n\n\"But surely you are to see the Emperor in the Place in the Sun,\" said\nMarguerite when she had returned the geography to the secret shelf.\n\n\"I have already seen him,\" I replied, \"my ticket was for the first\nperformance.\"\n\n\"It must be a magnificent sight,\" she sighed. \"I should so love to see\nthe sunlight. The pictures show us His Majesty's likeness, but what is a\npicture of sunlight?\"\n\n\"But you speak only of a reflected beam; how would you like to see real\nsunshine?\"\n\n\"Oh, on the roof of Berlin? But that is only for Royalty and the roof\nguards. I've tried to imagine that, but I know that I fail as a blind\nman must fail to imagine colour.\"\n\n\"Close your eyes,\" I said playfully, \"and try very hard.\"\n\nSolemnly Marguerite closed her eyes.\n\nFor a moment I smiled, and then the smile relaxed, for I felt as one who\nscoffs at prayer.\n\n\"And did you see the sunlight?\" I asked, as she opened her eyes and\ngazed at me with dilated pupils.\n\n\"No,\" she answered hoarsely, \"I only saw man-light as far as the walls\nof Berlin, and beyond that it was all empty blackness--and it\nfrightens me.\"\n\n\"The fear of darkness,\" I said, \"is the fear of ignorance.\"\n\n\"You try,\" and she reached over with a soft touch of her finger tips on\nmy closing eyelids. \"Now keep them closed and tell me what you see. Tell\nme it is not all black.\"\n\n\"I see light,\" I said, \"white light, on a billowy sea of clouds, as from\na flying plane.... And now I see the sun--it is sinking behind a rugged\nline of snowy peaks and the light is dimming.... It is gone now, but it\nis not dark, for moonlight, pale and silvery, is shimmering on a choppy\nsea.... Now it is the darkest hour, but it is never black, only a dark,\ndark grey, for the roof of the world is pricked with a million points of\nlight.... The grey of the east is shot with the rose of dawn.... The\nrose brightens to scarlet and the curve of the sun appears--red like the\nblood of war.... And now the sky is crystal blue and the grey sands of\nthe desert have turned to glittering gold.\"\n\nI had ceased my poetic visioning and was looking into Marguerite's face.\nThe light of worship I saw in her eyes filled me with a strange\ntrembling and holy awe.\n\n\"And I saw only blackness,\" she faltered. \"Is it that I am born blind\nand you with vision?\"\n\n\"Perhaps what you call vision is only memory,\" I said--but, as I\nrealized where my words were leading, I hastened to add--\"Memory, from\nanother life. Have you ever heard of such a thing as the reincarnation\nof the soul?\"\n\n\"That means,\" she said hesitatingly, \"that there is something in us that\ndoes not die--immortality, is it not?\"\n\n\"Well, it is something like that,\" I answered huskily, as I wondered\nwhat she might know or dream of that which lay beyond the ken of the\ngross materialism of her race. \"Immortality is a very beautiful idea,\" I\nwent on, \"and science has destroyed much that is beautiful. But it is a\npity that Col. Hellar had to eliminate the idea of immortality from the\nGerman Bible. Surely such a book makes no pretence of being scientific.\"\n\n\"So Col. Hellar has told you that he wrote 'God's Anointed'?\" exclaimed\nMarguerite with eager interest.\n\n\"Yes, he told me of that and I re-read the book with an entirely\ndifferent viewpoint since I came to understand the spirit in which it\nwas written.\"\n\n\"Ah--I see.\" Marguerite rose and stepped toward the library. \"We have a\nbook here,\" she called, \"that you have not read, and one that you cannot\nbuy. It will show you the source of Col. Hellar's inspiration.\"\n\nShe brought out a battered volume. \"This book,\" she stated, \"has given\nthe inspectors more trouble than any other book in existence. Though\nthey have searched for thirty years, they say there are more copies of\nit still at large than of all other forbidden books combined.\"\n\nI gazed at the volume she handed me--I was holding a copy of the\nChristian Bible translated six centuries previous by Martin Luther. It\nwas indeed the very text from which as a boy I had acquired much of my\nreading knowledge of the language. But I decided that I had best not\nreveal to Marguerite my familiarity with it, and so I sat down and\nturned the pages with assumed perplexity.\n\n\"It is a very odd book,\" I remarked presently. \"Have you read it?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" exclaimed Marguerite. \"I often read it; I think it is more\ninteresting than all these modern books, but perhaps that is because I\ncannot understand it; I love mysterious things.\"\n\n\"There is too much of it for a man as busy as I am to hope to read,\" I\nremarked, after turning a few more pages, \"and so I had better not\nbegin. Will you not choose something and read it aloud to me?\"\n\nMarguerite declined at first; but, when I insisted, she took the\ntattered Bible and turned slowly through its pages.\n\nAnd when she read, it was the story of a king who revelled with his\nlords, and of a hand that wrote upon a wall.\n\nHer voice was low, and possessed a rhythm and cadence that transmuted\nthe guttural German tongue into musical poetry.\n\nAgain she read, of a man who, though shorn of his strength by the wiles\nof a woman and blinded by his enemies, yet pushed asunder the pillars\nof a city.\n\nAt random she read other tales, of rulers and of slaves, of harlots and\nof queens--the wisdom of prophets--the songs of kings.\n\nTogether we pondered the meanings of these strange things, and exulted\nin the beauty of that which was meaningless. And so the hours passed;\nthe day drew near its close and Marguerite read from the last pages of\nthe book, of a voice that cried mightily--\"Babylon the great is fallen,\nis fallen, and is become the habitation of devils and the hold of every\nfoul spirit.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nFINDING THEREIN ONE RIGHTEOUS MAN I HAVE COMPASSION ON BERLIN\n\n\n~1~\n\nMy first call upon Marguerite had been followed by other visits when we\nhad talked of books and read together. On these occasions I had\ncarefully suppressed my desire to speak of more personal things. But,\nconstantly reminded by my own troubled conscience, I grew fearful lest\nthe old doctor should discover that the books were the lesser part of\nthe attraction that drew me to Marguerite's apartment, and my fear was\nincreased as I realized that my calls on Zimmern had abruptly ceased.\n\nThinking to make amends I went one evening to the doctor's apartment.\n\n\"I was going out shortly,\" said Zimmern, as he greeted me. \"I have a\ndinner engagement with Hellar on the Free Level. But I still have a little\ntime; if it pleases you we might walk along to our library.\"\n\nI promptly accepted the invitation, hoping that it would enable me\nbetter to establish my relation to Marguerite and Zimmern in a safe\ntriangle of mutual friendship. As we walked, Zimmern, as if he read my\nthoughts, turned the conversation to the very subject that was uppermost\nin my mind.\n\n\"I am glad, Armstadt,\" he said with a gracious smile, \"that you and\nMarguerite seem to enjoy each other's friendship. I had often wished\nthere were younger men in our group, since her duties as caretaker of\nour books quite forbids her cultivating the acquaintance of any men\noutside our chosen few. Marguerite is very patient with the dull talk of\nus old men, but life is not all books, and there is much that youth\nmay share.\"\n\nFor these words of Zimmern's I was quite unprepared. He seemed to be\ninviting me to make love to Marguerite, and I wondered to what extent\nthe prevailing social ethics might have destroyed the finer\nsensibilities that forbid the sharing of a woman's love.\n\nWhen we reached the apartment Marguerite greeted us with a perfect\ndemocracy of manner. But my reassurance of the moment was presently\ndisturbed when she turned to Zimmern and said: \"Now that you are here, I\nam going for a bit of a walk; I have not been out for two whole days.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" the doctor replied. \"I cannot remain long as I have an\nengagement with Hellar, but perhaps Armstadt will remain until\nyou return.\"\n\n\"Then I shall have him all to myself,\" declared Marguerite with quiet\nseriousness.\n\nThough I glanced from the old doctor to the young woman in questioning\namazement, neither seemed in the least embarrassed or aware that\nanything had been said out of keeping with the customary propriety\nof life.\n\nMarguerite, throwing the blue velvet cape about her bare white\nshoulders, paused to give the old doctor an affectionate kiss, and with\na smile for me was gone.\n\nFor a few moments the doctor sat musing; but when he turned to me it was\nto say: \"I hope that you are making good use of our precious\naccumulation of knowledge.\"\n\nIn reply I assured him of my hearty appreciation of the library.\n\n\"You can see now,\" continued Zimmern, \"how utterly the mind of the race\nhas been enslaved, how all the vast store of knowledge, that as a whole\nmakes life possible, is parcelled out for each. Not one of us is\nsupposed to know of those vital things outside our own narrow field.\nThat knowledge is forbidden us lest we should understand the workings of\nour social system and question the wisdom of it all. And so, while each\nis wiser in his own little cell than were the men of the old order, yet\non all things else we are little children, accepting what we are taught,\ndoing what we are told, with no mind, no souls of our own. Scientists\nhave ceased to be men, and have become thinking machines, specialized\nfor their particular tasks.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" I said, \"but what are we to do about it? You have by\nthese forbidden books acquired a realization of the enslavement of the\nrace--but the others, all these millions of professional men, are they\nnot hopelessly rendered impotent by the systematic Suppression of\nknowledge?\"\n\n\"The millions, yes,\" replied Zimmern, \"but there are the chosen few; we\nwho have seen the light must find a way for the liberation of all.\"\n\n\"Do you mean,\" I asked eagerly, \"that you are planning some secret\nrebellion--that you hope for some possible rising of the people to\noverthrow the system?\"\n\nZimmern looked at me in astonishment. \"The people,\" he said, \"cannot\nrise. In the old order such a thing was possible--revolutions they\ncalled them--the people led by heroes conceived passions for liberty.\nBut such powers of mental reaction no longer exist in German minds. We\nhave bred and trained it out of them. One might as well have expected\nthe four-footed beasts of burden in the old agricultural days to rebel\nagainst their masters.\"\n\n\"But,\" I protested, \"if the people could be enlightened?\"\n\n\"How,\" exclaimed Zimmern impatiently, \"can you enlighten them? You are\nyoung, Armstadt, very young to talk of such things--even if a rebellion\nwas a possibility what would be the gain? Rebellion means disorder--once\nthe ventilating machinery of the city and the food processes were\ndisturbed we should all perish in this trap--we should all die of\nsuffocation and starvation.\"\n\n\"Then why,\" I asked, \"do you talk of this thing? If rebellion is\nimpossible and would, if possible, destroy us all, then is there\nany hope?\"\n\nZimmern paced the floor for a time in silence and then, facing me\nsquarely, he said, \"I have confessed to you my dissatisfaction with the\nexisting state. In doing this I placed myself in great danger, but I\nrisked that and now I shall risk more. I ask you now, Are you with us\nto the end?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied very gravely, \"I am with you although I cannot fully\nunderstand on what you base your hope.\"\n\n\"Our hope,\" replied Zimmern, \"is out there in the world from whence come\nthose flying men who rain bombs on the roof of Berlin and for ever keep\nus patching it. We must get word to them. We must throw ourselves upon\nthe humanity of our enemies and ask them to save us.\"\n\n\"But,\" I questioned, in my excitement, \"what can Germany expect of the\nenemy? She has made war against the world for centuries--will that world\npermit Germany to live could they find a way to destroy her?\"\n\n\"As a nation, no, but as men, yes. Men do not kill men as individuals,\nthey only make war against a nation of men. As long as Germany is\ncapable of making war against the world so long will the world attempt\nto destroy her. You, Colonel Armstadt, hold in your protium secret the\npower of Germany to continue the war against the world. Because you were\nabout to gain that power I risked my own life to aid you in getting a\nwider knowledge. Because you now hold that power I risk it again by\nasking you to use it to destroy Germany and save the Germans. The men\nwho are with me in this cause, and for whom I speak, are but a few. The\nmillions materially alive, are spiritually dead. The world alone can\ngive them life again as men. Even though a few million more be destroyed\nin the giving have not millions already been destroyed? What if you do\nsave Germany now--what does it mean merely that we breed millions more\nlike we now have, soulless creatures born to die like worms in the\nground, brains working automatically, stamping out one sort of idea,\nlike machines that stamp out buttons--or mere mouths shouting like\nphonographs before this gaudy show of royalty?\"\n\n\"But,\" I said, \"you speak for the few emancipated minds; what of all\nthese men who accept the system--you call them slaves, yet are they not\ncontent with their slavery, do they want to be men of the world or\ncontinue here in their bondage and die fighting to keep up their own\nsystem of enslavement?\"\n\n\"It makes no difference what they want,\" replied Zimmern, in a voice\nthat trembled with emotion; \"we bred them as slaves to the _kultur_ of\nGermany, the thing to do is to stop the breeding.\"\n\n\"But how,\" I asked, \"can men who have been beaten into the mould of the\nox ever be restored to their humanity?\"\n\n\"The old ones cannot,\" sighed Zimmern; \"it was always so; when a people\nhas once fallen into evil ways the old generation can never be wholly\nredeemed, but youth can always be saved--youth is plastic.\"\n\n\"But the German race,\" I said, \"has not only been mis-educated, it has\nbeen mis-bred. Can you undo inheritance? Can this race with its vast\nhorde of workers bred for a maximum of muscle and a minimum of brains\never escape from that stupidity that has been bred into the blood?\"\n\n\"You have been trained as a chemist,\" said Zimmern, \"you despair of the\nfuture because you do not understand the laws of inheritance. A\nspecialized type of man or animal is produced from the selection of the\nextreme individuals. That you know. But what you do not know is that the\ntype once established does not persist of its own accord. It can only be\nmaintained by the rigid continuance of the selection. The average\nstature of man did not change a centimetre in a thousand years, till we\ncame in with our meddlesome eugenics. Leave off our scientific meddling\nand the race will quickly revert to the normal type.\n\n\"That applies to the physical changes; in the mental powers the\nrestoration will be even more rapid, because we have made less change in\nthe psychic elements of the germ plasm. The inborn capacity of the human\nbrain is hard to alter. Men are created more nearly equal than even the\nwriters of democratic constitutions have ever known. If the World State\nwill once help us to free ourselves from these shackles of rigid caste\nand cultured ignorance, this folly of scientific meddling with the blood\nand brains of man, there is yet hope for this race, for we have changed\nfar less than we pretend, in the marrow we are human still.\"\n\nThe old man sank back in his chair. The fire in his soul had burned out.\nHis hand fumbled for his watch. \"I must leave you now,\" he said;\n\"Marguerite should be back shortly. From her you need conceal nothing.\nShe is the soul of our hopes and our dreams. She keeps our books safe\nand our hearts fine. Without her I fear we should all have given up\nlong ago.\"\n\nWith a trembling handclasp he left me alone in Marguerite's apartment.\nAnd alone too with my conflicting and troubled emotions. He was a\nlovable soul, ripe with the wisdom of age, yet youthful in his hopes to\nredeem his people from the curse of this unholy blend of socialism and\nautocracy that had prostituted science and made a black Utopian\nnightmare of man's millennial dream.\n\nVaguely I wondered how many of the three hundred millions of German\nsouls--for I could not accept the soulless theory of Zimmern--were yet\ncapable of a realization of their humanity. To this query there could be\nno answer, but of one conclusion I was certain, it was not my place to\nask what these people wanted, for their power to decide was destroyed by\nthe infernal process of their making--but here at least, my democratic\ntraining easily gave the answer that Dr. Zimmern had achieved by sheer\ngenius, and my answer was that for men whose desire for liberty has been\ndestroyed, liberty must be thrust upon them.\n\nBut it remained for me to work out a plan for so difficult a salvation.\nOf this I was now assured that I need no longer work alone, for as I had\nlong suspected, Dr. Zimmern and his little group of rebellious souls\nwere with me. But what could so few do amidst all the millions? My\nanswer, like Zimmern's, was that the salvation of Germany lay in the\nenemies' hands--and I alone was of that enemy. Yet never again could I\npray for the destruction of the city at the hands of the outraged\ngod--Humanity. And I thought of Sodom and Gomorrah which the God of\nAbraham had agreed to spare if there be found ten righteous men therein.\n\n~2~\n\nFrom these far-reaching thoughts my mind was drawn sharply back to the\nfact of my presence in Marguerite's apartment and the realization that\nshe would shortly return to find me there alone. I resented the fact\nthat the old doctor and the young woman could conspire to place me in\nsuch a situation. I resented the fact that a girl like Marguerite could\nbe bound to a man three times her age, and yet seem to accept it with\nperfect grace. But I resented most of all the fact that both she and\nZimmern appeared to invite me to share in a triangle of love, open and\nunashamed.\n\nMy bitter brooding was disturbed by the sound of a key turning in the\nlock, and Marguerite, fresh and charming from the exhilaration of her\nwalk, came into the room.\n\n\"I am so glad you remained,\" she said. \"I hope no one else comes and we\ncan have the evening to ourselves.\"\n\n\"It seems,\" I answered with a touch of bitterness, \"that Dr. Zimmern\nconsiders me quite a safe playmate for you.\"\n\nAt my words Marguerite blushed prettily. \"I know you do not quite\nunderstand,\" she said, \"but you see I am rather peculiarly situated. I\ncannot go out much, and I can have no girl friends here, and no men\neither except those who are in this little group who know of our books.\nAnd they, you see, are all rather old, mostly staff officers like the\ndoctor himself, and Col. Hellar. You rank quite as well as some of the\nothers, but you are ever so much younger. That is why the doctor thinks\nyou are so wonderful--I mean because you have risen so high at so early\nan age--but perhaps I think you are rather wonderful just because you\nare young. Is it not natural for young people to want friends of\ntheir own age?\"\n\n\"It is,\" I replied with ill-concealed sarcasm.\n\n\"Why do you speak like that?\" asked Marguerite in pained surprise.\n\n\"Because a burnt child dreads the fire.\"\n\n\"I do not understand,\" she said, a puzzled look in her eyes. \"How could\na child be burned by a fire since it could never approach one. They only\nhave fires in the smelting furnaces, and children could never go\nnear them.\"\n\nDespite my bitter mood I smiled as I said: \"It is just a figure of\nspeech that I got out of an old book. It means that when one is hurt by\nsomething he does not want to be hurt in the same way again. You\nremember what you said to me in the caf\u00e9 about looking up the girl who\nplayed the innocent r\u00f4le? I did look her up, and you were right about\nit. She has been, here three years and has a score of lovers.\"\n\n\"And you dropped her?\"\n\n\"Of course I dropped her.\"\n\n\"And you have not found another?\"\n\n\"No, and I do not want another, and I had not made love to this girl\neither, as you think I had; perhaps I would have done so, but thanks to\nyou I was warned in time. I may be even younger than you think I am,\nyoung at least in experience with the free women of Berlin. This is the\nsecond apartment I have ever been in on this level.\"\n\n\"Why do you tell me this?\" questioned Marguerite.\n\n\"Because,\" I said doggedly, \"because I suppose that I want you to know\nthat I have spent most of my time in a laboratory. I also want you to\nknow that I do not like the artful deceit that you all seem to\ncultivate.\"\n\n\"And do you think I am trying to deceive you?\" cried Marguerite\nreproachfully.\n\n\"Your words may be true,\" I said, \"but the situation you place me in is\na false one. Dr. Zimmern brings me here that I may read your books. He\nleaves me alone here with you and urges me to come as often as I choose.\nAll that is hard enough, but to make it harder for me, you tell me that\nyou particularly want my company because you have no other young\nfriends. In fact you practically ask me to make love to you and yet you\nknow why I cannot.\"\n\nIn the excitement of my warring emotions I had risen and was pacing the\nfloor, and now as I reached the climax of my bitter speech, Marguerite,\nwith a choking sob, fled from the room.\n\nAngered at the situation and humiliated by what I had said, I was on the\npoint of leaving at once. But a moment of reflection caused me to turn\nback. I had forced a quarrel upon Marguerite and the cause for my anger\nshe perhaps did not comprehend. If I left now it would be impossible to\nreturn, and if I did not come back, there would be explanations to make\nto Zimmern and perhaps an ending of my association with him and his\ngroup, which was not only the sole source of my intellectual life\noutside my work, but which I had begun to hope might lead to some\nenterprise of moment and possibly to my escape from Berlin.\n\nSo calming my anger, I turned to the library and doggedly pulled down a\nbook and began scanning its contents. I had been so occupied for some\ntime, when there was a ring at the bell. I peered out into the\nreception-room in time to see Marguerite come from another door. Her\neyes revealed the fact that she had been crying. Quickly she closed the\ndoor of the little library, shutting me in with the books. A moment\nlater she came in with a grey-haired man, a staff officer of the\nelectrical works. She introduced us coolly and then helped the old man\nfind a book he wanted to take out, and which she entered on her records.\n\nAfter the visitor had gone Marguerite again slipped out of the room and\nfor a time I despaired of a chance to speak to her before I felt I must\ndepart. Another hour passed and then she stole into the library and\nseated herself very quietly on a little dressing chair and watched me as\nI proceeded with my reading.\n\nI asked her some questions about one of the volumes and she replied with\na meek and forgiving voice that made me despise myself heartily. Other\nquestions and answers followed and soon we were talking again of books\nas if we had no overwhelming sense of the personal presence of\neach other.\n\nThe hours passed; by all my sense of propriety I should have been long\ndeparted, but still we talked of books without once referring to my\nheated words of the earlier evening.\n\nShe had stood enticingly near me as we pulled down the volumes. My heart\nbeat wildly as she sat by my side, while I mechanically turned the\npages. The brush of her garments against my sleeve quite maddened me. I\nhad not dared to look into her eyes, as I talked meaningless,\nbookish words.\n\nSummoning all my self-control, I now faced her. \"Marguerite,\" I said\nhoarsely, \"look at me.\"\n\nShe lifted her eyes and met my gaze unflinchingly, the moisture of fresh\ntears gleaming beneath her lashes.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" I entreated.\n\n\"For what?\" she asked simply, smiling a little through her tears.\n\n\"For being a fool,\" I declared fiercely, \"for believing your cordiality\ntoward me as Dr. Zimmern's friend to mean more than--than it\nshould mean.\"\n\n\"But I do not understand,\" she said. \"Should I not have told you that I\nliked you because you were young? Of course if you don't want me\nto--to--\" She paused abruptly, her face suffused with a\ndelicate crimson.\n\nI stepped toward her and reached out my arms. But she drew back and\nslipped quickly around the table. \"No,\" she cried, \"no, you have said\nthat you did not want me.\"\n\n\"But I do,\" I cried. \"I do want you.\"\n\n\"Then why did you say those things to me?\" she asked haughtily.\n\nI gazed at her across the narrow table. Was it possible that such a\nwoman had no understanding of ideals of honour in love? Could it be that\nshe had no appreciation of the fight I had waged, and so nearly lost, to\nrespect the trust and confidence that the old doctor had placed in me.\nWith these thoughts the ardour of my passion cooled and a feeling of\npity swept over me, as I sensed the tragedy of so fine a woman ethically\nimpoverished by false training and environment. Had she known honour,\nand yet discarded it, I too should have been unable to resist the\nimpulse of youth to deny to age its less imperious claims.\n\nBut either she chose artfully to ignore my struggle or she was truly\nunaware of it. In either case she would not share the responsibility for\nthe breach of faith. I was puzzled and confounded.\n\nIt was Marguerite who broke the bewildering silence. \"I wish you would\ngo now,\" she said coolly; \"I am afraid I misunderstood.\"\n\n\"And shall I come again?\" I asked awkwardly.\n\nShe looked up at me and smiled bravely. \"Yes,\" she said, \"if--you are\nsure you wish to.\"\n\nA resurge of passionate longing to take her in my arms swept over me,\nbut she held out her hand with such rare and dignified grace that I\ncould only take the slender fingers and press them hungrily to my\nfevered lips and so bid her a wordless adieu.\n\n~3~\n\nBut despite wild longing to see her again, I did not return to\nMarguerite's apartment for many weeks. A crisis in my work at the\nlaboratory denied me even a single hour of leisure outside brief\nsnatches of food and sleep.\n\nI had previously reported to the Chemical Staff that I had found means\nto increase materially the extraction percentage of the precious element\nprotium from the crude imported ore. I had now received word that I\nshould prepare to make a trial demonstration before the Staff.\n\nAlready I had revealed certain results of my progress to Herr von Uhl,\nas this had been necessary in order to get further grants of the rare\nmaterial and of expensive equipment needed for the research, but in\nthese smaller demonstrations, I had not been called upon to disclose my\nmethod. Now the Staff, hopeful that I had made the great discovery,\ninsisted that I prepare at once to make a large scale demonstration and\nreveal the method that it might immediately be adopted for the wholesale\nextraction in the industrial works.\n\nIf I now gave away the full secret of my process, I would receive\ncompensation that would indeed seem lavish for a man whose mental\nhorizon was bounded by these enclosing walls; yet to me for whom these\nwalls would always be a prison, credit at the banks of Berlin and the\nbaubles of decoration and rank and social honour would be sounding\nbrass. But I wanted power; and, with the secret of protium extraction in\nmy possession, I would have control of life or death over three hundred\nmillion men. Why should I sacrifice such power for useless credit and\nempty honour? If Eitel I of the House of Hohenzollern would lengthen the\ndays of his rule, let him deal with me and meet whatever terms I chose\nto name, for in my chemical retorts I had brewed a secret before which\nvaunted efficiency and hypocritical divinity could be made to bend a\nhungry belly and beg for food!\n\nIt was a laudable and rather thrilling ambition, and yet I was not clear\nas to just what terms I would dictate, nor how I could enforce the\ndictation. To ask for an audience with the Emperor now, and to take any\nsuch preposterous stand would merely be to get myself locked up for a\nlunatic. But I reasoned that if I could make the demonstration so that\nit would be accepted as genuine and yet not give away my secret, the\nsituation would be in my hands. Yet I was expected to reveal the process\nstep by step as the demonstration proceeded. There was but one way out\nand that was to make a genuine demonstration, but with falsely\nwritten formulas.\n\nTo plan and prepare such a demonstration required more genuine invention\nthan had the discovery of the process, but I set about the task with\nfeverish enthusiasm. I kept my assistants busy with the preparation of\nthe apparatus and the more simple work which there was no need to\ndisguise, while night after night I worked alone, altering and\ndisguising the secret steps on which my great discovery hinged. As these\npreparations were nearing completion I sent for Dr. Zimmern and Col.\nHellar to meet me at my apartment.\n\n\"Comrades,\" I said, \"you have endangered your own lives by confiding in\nme your secret desires to overthrow the rule of the House of\nHohenzollern as it was overthrown once before. You have done this\nbecause you believed that I would have power that others do not have.\"\n\nThe two old men nodded in grave assent.\n\n\"And you have been quite fortunate in your choice,\" I concluded, \"for\nnot only have I pledged myself to your ends, but I shall soon possess\nthe coveted power. In a few days I shall demonstrate my process on a\nlarge scale before the Chemical Staff. But I shall do this thing without\nrevealing the method. The formulas I shall give them will be\nmeaningless. As long as I am in charge in my own laboratory the process\nwill be a success; when it is tried elsewhere it will fail, until I\nchoose to make further revelations.\n\n\"So you see, for a time, unless I be killed or tortured into confession,\nI shall have great power. How then may I use that power to help you in\nthe cause to which we are pledged?\"\n\nThe older men seemed greatly impressed with my declaration and danced\nabout me and cried with joy. When they had regained their composure\nZimmern said: \"There is but one thing you can do for us and that is to\nfind some way to get word of the protium mines to the authorities of the\nWorld State. Berlin will then be at their mercy, but whatever happens\ncan be no worse than the continuance of things as they are.\"\n\n\"But how,\" I said, \"can a message be sent from Berlin to the outer\nworld?\"\n\n\"There is only one way,\" replied Hellar, \"and that is by the submarines\nthat go out for this ore. The Submarine Staff are members of the Royal\nHouse. So, indeed, are the captains. We have tried for years to gain the\nconfidence of some of these men, but without avail. Perhaps through your\nwork on the protium ore you can succeed where we have failed.\"\n\n\"And how,\" I asked eagerly, \"do the ore-bringing vessels get from Berlin\nto the sea?\"\n\nMy visitors glanced at each other significantly. \"Do you not know that?\"\nexclaimed Zimmern. \"We had supposed you would have been told when you\nwere assigned to the protium research.\"\n\nBy way of answer I explained that I knew the source of the ore but not\nthe route of its coming.\n\n\"All such knowledge is suppressed in books,\" commented Hellar; \"we older\nmen know of this by word of mouth from the days when the submarine\ntunnel was completed to the sea, but you are younger. Unless this was\ntold you at the time you were assigned the work it is not to be expected\nthat you would know.\"\n\nI questioned Hellar and Zimmern closely but found that all they knew was\nthat a submarine tunnel did exist leading from Berlin somewhere into the\nopen sea; but its exact location they did not know. Again I pressed my\nquestion as to what I could do with the power of my secret and they\ncould only repeat that they staked their hopes on getting word to the\nouter world by way of submarines.\n\nMuch as I might admire the strength of character that would lead men to\nrebel against the only life they knew because they sensed that it was\nhopeless, I now found myself a little exasperated at the vagueness of\ntheir plans. Yet I had none better. To defy the Emperor would merely be\nto risk my life and the possible loss of my knowledge to the world.\nPerhaps after all the older heads were wiser than my own rebellious\nspirit; and so, without making any more definite plans, I ended the\ninterview with a promise to let them know of the outcome of the\ndemonstration.\n\nReturning once more to my work I finished my preparations and sent word\nto the Chemical Staff that all was ready. They came with solemn faces.\nThe laboratory was locked and guards were posted. The place was examined\nthoroughly, the apparatus was studied in detail. All my ingredients were\ntested for the presence of extracted protium, lest I be trying to \"salt\nthe mine.\" But happily for me they accepted my statement as to their\nchemical nature in other respects. Then when all had been approved the\ntest lot of ore was run. It took us thirty hours to run the extraction\nand sample and weigh and test the product. But everything went through\nexactly as I had planned.\n\nWith solemn faces the Chemical Staff unanimously declared that the\nproblem had been solved and marvelled that the solution should come from\nthe brain of so young a man. And so I received their adulation and\nworship, for I could not give credit to the chemists of the world\noutside to whom I was really indebted for my seeming miraculous genius.\nTelling me to take my rest and prepare myself for an audience with His\nMajesty three days later, the Chemical Staff departed, carrying, with\nguarded secrecy, my false formulas.\n\n~4~\n\nExultant and happy I left the laboratory. I had not slept for forty\nhours and scarcely half my regular allotment for many weeks. And yet I was\nnot sleepy now but awake and excited. I had won a great victory, and I\nwanted to rejoice and share my conquest with sympathetic ears. I could\ngo to Zimmern, but instead I turned my steps toward the elevator and,\nalighting on the Level of the Free Women, I went straightway to\nMarguerite's apartment.\n\nDespite my feeling of exhilaration, my face must have revealed something\nof my real state of exhaustion, for Marguerite cried in alarm at the\nsight of me.\n\n\"A little tired,\" I replied, in answer to her solicitous questions; \"I\nhave just finished my demonstration before the Chemical Staff.\"\n\n\"And you won?\" cried Marguerite in a burst of joy. \"You deceived them\njust as the doctor said you would. And they know you have solved the\nprotium problem and they do not know how you did it?\"\n\n\"That is correct,\" I said, sinking back into the cushions of the divan.\n\"I have done all that. I came here first to tell you. You see I could\nnot come before, all these weeks, I have had no time for sleep or\nanything. I would have telephoned or written but I feared it would not\nbe safe. Did you think I was not coming again?\"\n\n\"I missed you at first,--I mean at first I thought you were staying away\nbecause you did not want to see me, and then Dr. Zimmern told me what\nyou were doing, and I understood--and waited, for I somehow knew you\nwould come as soon as you could.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course you knew. Of course, I had to come--Marguerite--\" But\nMarguerite faded before my vision. I reached out my hand for her--and it\nseemed to wave in empty space....\n\n~5~\n\nWhen I awoke, I was lying on a couch and a screen bedecked with cupids\nwas standing before me. At first I thought I was alone and then I\nrealized that I was in Marguerite's apartment and that Marguerite\nherself was seated on a low stool beside the couch and gazing at me out\nof dreamy eyes.\n\n\"How did I get here?\" I asked.\n\n\"You fell asleep while you were talking, and then some one came for\nbooks, and when the bell rang I hid you with the screen.\"\n\n\"How long have I slept?\"\n\n\"For many hours,\" she answered.\n\n\"I ought not to have come,\" I said, but despite my remark I made no\nhaste to go, but reached out and ran my fingers through her massy hair.\nAnd then I slowly drew her toward me until her luxuriant locks were\ntumbled about my neck and face and her head was pillowed on my breast.\n\n\"I am so happy,\" she whispered. \"I am so glad you came first to me.\"\n\nFor a moment my reason was drugged by the opiate of her touch; and then,\nas the realization of the circumstances re-formed in my brain, the\nfeeling of guilt arose and routed the dreamy bliss. Yet I could only\nblame myself, for there was no guile in her act or word, nor could I\nbelieve there was guile in her heart. Gently I pushed her away and\narose, stating that I must leave at once.\n\nIt was plainly evident that Marguerite did not share my sense of\nembarrassment, that she was aware of no breach of ethics. But her ease\nonly served to impress upon me the greater burden of my responsibility\nand emphasize the breach of honour of which I was guilty in permitting\nthis expression of my love to a woman whom circumstances had bound\nto Zimmern.\n\nPleading need for rest and for time to plan my interview with His\nMajesty, I hastened away, feeling that I dare not trust myself alone\nwith her again.\n\n~6~\n\nI returned to my own apartment, and when another day had passed, food\nand sleep had fully restored me to a normal state. I then recalled my\npromise to inform Hellar and Zimmern of the outcome of my demonstration.\nI called at Zimmern's quarters but he was not at home. Hence I went to\ncall on Hellar, to ask of Zimmern's whereabouts.\n\n\"I have an appointment to meet him tonight,\" said Hellar, \"on the Level\nof Free Women. Will you not come along?\"\n\nI could not well do otherwise than accept, and Hellar led me again to\nthe apartment from which I had fled twenty-four hours before. There we\nfound Zimmern, who received me with his usual graciousness.\n\n\"I have already heard from Marguerite,\" said Zimmern, \"of your success.\"\n\nI glanced apprehensively at the girl but she was in no wise disturbed,\nand proceeded to relate for Hellar's information the story of my coming\nto her exhausted from my work and of my falling asleep in her apartment.\nAll of them seemed to think it amusing, but there was no evidence that\nany one considered it the least improper. Their matter-of-fact attitude\npuzzled and annoyed me; they seemed to treat the incident as if it had\nbeen the experience of a couple of children.\n\nThis angered me, for it seemed proof that they considered Marguerite's\nlove as the common property of any and all.\n\n\"Could it be,\" I asked myself, \"that jealousy has been bred and trained\nout of this race? Is it possible they have killed the instinct that\ndemands private and individual property in love?\" Even as I pondered the\nproblem it seemed answered, for as I sat and talked with Zimmern and\nHellar of my chemical demonstration and the coming interview with His\nMajesty, Marguerite came and seated herself on the arm of my chair and\npillowed her head on my shoulder.\n\nTroubled and embarrassed, yet not having the courage to repulse her\ncaresses, I stared at Zimmern, who smiled on us with indulgence. In fact\nit seemed that he actually enjoyed the scene. My anger flamed up against\nhim, but for Marguerite I had only pity, for her action seemed so\nnatural and unaffected that I could not believe that she was making\nsport of me, and could only conclude that she had been so bred in the\nspirit of the place that she knew nothing else.\n\nMy talk with the men ended as had the last one, without arriving at any\nparticular plan of action, and when Hellar arose first to go, I took the\nopportunity to escape from what to me was an intolerable situation.\n\n~7~\n\nI separated from Hellar and for an hour or more I wandered on the level.\nThen resolving to end the strain of my enigmatical position I turned\nagain toward Marguerite's apartment. She answered my ring. I entered and\nfound her alone.\n\n\"Marguerite,\" I began, \"I cannot stand this intolerable situation. I\ncannot share the love of a woman with another man--I cannot steal a\nwoman's love from a man who is my friend--\"\n\nAt this outburst Marguerite only stared at me in puzzled amazement.\n\"Then you do not want me to love you,\" she stammered.\n\n\"God knows,\" I cried, \"how I do want you to love me, but it must not be\nwhile Dr. Zimmern is alive and you--\"\n\n\"So,\" said a voice--and glancing up I saw Zimmern himself framed in the\ndoorway of the book room. The old doctor looked from me to Marguerite,\nwhile a smile beamed on his courtly countenance.\n\n\"Sit down and calm yourself, Armstadt,\" said Zimmern. \"It is time I\nspoke to you of Marguerite and of the relation I bear to her. As you\nknow, I brought her to this level from the school for girls of forbidden\nbirth. But what you do not know is that she was born on the Royal Level.\n\n\"I knew Marguerite's mother. She was Princess Fedora, a third cousin of\nthe Empress. I was her physician, for I have not always been in the\nEugenic Service. But Marguerite was born out of wedlock, and the mother\ndeclined to name the father of her child. Because of that the child was\nconsigned to the school for forbidden love-children, which meant that\nshe would be fated for the life of a free woman and become the property\nof such men as had the price to pay.\n\n\"When her child was taken away from her, the mother killed herself; and\nbecause I declined to testify as to what I knew of the case I lost my\ncommission as a physician of Royalty. But still having the freedom of\nthe school levels, I was permitted to keep track of Marguerite. As soon\nas she reached the age of her freedom I brought her here, and by the aid\nof her splendid birth and the companionship of thinking men she has\nbecome the woman you now find her.\"\n\nIn my jealousy I had listened to the first words of the old doctor with\nbut little comprehension. But as he talked on so calmly and kindly an\neager hope leaped up within me. Was it possible that it had been I who\nhad misunderstood--and that Zimmern's love for Marguerite was of another\nsort than mine?\n\nTensely I awaited his further words, but I did not dare to look at\nMarguerite, who had taken her place beside him.\n\n\"I brought her here,\" Zimmern continued, \"for there was no other place\nwhere she could go except into the keeping of some man. I have given her\nthe work of guarding our books, and for that I could have well afforded\nto pay for her living.\n\n\"You find in Marguerite a woman of intelligence, and there are few\nenough like her. And she finds in you a man of rare gifts, and you are\nboth young, so it is not strange that you two should love each other.\nAll this I considered before I brought you here to meet her. I was happy\nwhen Marguerite told me that it was so. But your happiness is marred,\nbecause you, Armstadt, think that I am in the way; you have believed\nthat I bear the relation to Marguerite that the fact of my paying for\nher presence on this level would imply.\n\n\"It speaks well of your honour,\" the doctor went on, \"that you have felt\nas you did. I should have explained sooner, but I did not wish to speak\nof this until it was necessary to Marguerite's happiness. But now that I\nhave spoken there is nothing to stand in the way of your happiness, for\nMarguerite is as worthy of your love as if she had but made her d\u00e9but on\nthe Royal Level to which she was born. As for what is to be between you,\nI can only leave it to the best that is in yourselves, and whatever that\nmay be has my blessing.\"\n\nAs I listened to the doctor's words entranced with rapture, the vision\nof Marguerite floated hazily before my eyes as if she were an ethereal\nessence that might, at any moment, be snatched away. But as the doctor's\nwords ceased my eyes met Marguerite's and all else seemed to fade but\nthe love light that shone from out their liquid depths.\n\nForgetting utterly the presence of the man whose words had set us free,\nour hearts reached out with hungry arms to claim their own.\n\nFor us, time lost her reckoning amidst our tears and kisses, and when my\nbrain at last made known to me the existence of other souls than ours, I\nlooked up and found that we were alone. A saucy little clock ticked\nrhythmically on a mantel. I felt an absurd desire to smash it, for the\nimpudent thing had been running all the while.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nIN WHICH I SALUTE THE STATUE OF GOD AND A PSYCHIC\nEXPERT EXPLORES MY BRAIN AND FINDS NOTHING\n\n\n~1~\n\nThe Chemical Staff called for me at my laboratory to conduct me to the\npresence of the Emperor. At the elevator we were met by an electric\nvehicle manned fore and aft by pompous guards. Through the wide, high\nstreets we rolled noiselessly past the decorated facades of the spacious\napartments that housed the seventeen thousand members of the House of\nHohenzollern.\n\nAt times the ample streets broadened into still more roomy avenues where\npotted trees alternated with the frescoed columns, and beyond which were\nluxurious gardens and vast statuary halls. On the Level of Free Women\nthe life was one of crowded revelry, of the bauble and delights of\ncarnival, but on the Royal Level there was an atmosphere of luxurious\nleisure, with vast spaces given over to the privacy of aristocratic\nidleness.\n\nAn occasional vehicle rolled swiftly past us on the glassy smoothness of\nthe pavement; more rarely lonely couples strolled among the potted trees\nor sat in dreamy indolence beside the fountains. There was no crowding,\nno mass of humanity, no narrow halls, no congested apartments. All\nstructure here was on a scale of magnificent size and distances, while\nby comparison the men and women appeared dwarfed, but withal distinctive\nin their costumes and regal in their leisurely idleness.\n\nAfter some kilometres of travel we came to His Majesty's palace, which\nstood detached from all other enclosed structures and was surrounded on\nall sides by ever-necessary columns that seemed like a forest of tree\ntrunks spaced and distanced in geometrical design.\n\nAs we approached the massive doorway of the palace, our party paused,\nand stood stiffly erect. Before us were two colossal statues of\nglistening white crystal. My fellow scientists faced one of the figures,\nwhich I recognized as that of William II, and I, a little tardily,\nsaluted with them. And now we turned sharply on our heels and saluted\nthe second figure of these twin German heroes. For German it was\nunmistakably in every feature, save for the one oddity that the Teutonic\nface wore a flowing beard not unlike that of Michael Angelo's Moses. As\nwe moved forward my eye swept in the lettering on the pedestal, _\"Unser\nAlte Deutche Gott,\"_ and I was aware that I had acknowledged my\nallegience to the supreme war lord--I had saluted the Statue of God.\n\nEntering the palace we were conducted through a long hall-way hung with\nfloral tapestries. We passed through several great metal doors guarded\nby stalwart leaden-faced men and came at last into the imperial audience\nroom, where His Majesty, Eitel I, satellited by his ministers, sat stiff\nand upright at the head of the council table.\n\nThough he had seemed a small man when I had seen him in the dazzling\nbeam of the reflected sunlight, I now perceived that he was of more than\naverage stature. He wore no crown and no helmet, but only a crop of\nstiff iron grey hair brushed boldly upright. His face was stern, his\nnose beak-like, and his small eyes grey and piercing. Over the high back\nof his chair was thrown his cape, and he was clad in a jacket of white\ncellulose velvet buttoned to the throat with large platinum buttons.\n\nFormally presented by one of the secretaries we made our stiff bows and\nwere seated at the table facing His Majesty across the unlittered\nsurface of black glass.\n\nThe Emperor nodded to the Chief of the Chemical Staff who arose and read\nthe report of my solution of the protium problem. He ended by advising\nthat the process should immediately replace the one then in use in the\nextraction of the ore in the industrial works and that I was recommended\nfor promotion to the place to be vacated by the retiring member of the\nChemical Staff and should be given full charge of the protium industry.\n\nEmperor Eitel listened with solemn nods of approval. When the reading\nwas finished he arose and proclaimed the retirement with honour, and\nbecause of his advanced age, of Herr von Uhl. The old chemist now\nstepped forward and the Emperor removed from von Uhl's breast the\ninsignia of active Staff service and replaced it with the insignia of\nhonourable retirement.\n\nIn my turn I also stood before His Majesty, who when he had pinned upon\nmy breast the Staff insignia said: \"I hereby commission you as Member of\nthe Chemical Staff and Director of the Protium Works. Against the\nfortune, to be accredited to you and your descendants, you are\nauthorized to draw from the Imperial Bank a million marks a year. That\nyou shall more graciously befit this fortune I confer upon you the title\nof 'von' and the social privilege of the Royal Level.\"\n\nWhen the formal ceremonies were ended I again arose and addressed the\nEmperor. \"Your Majesty,\" I said, as I looked unflinchingly at his iron\nvisage, \"I beg leave to make a personal petition.\"\n\n\"State it,\" commanded the Emperor.\n\n\"I wish to ask that you restore to the Royal Level a girl who is now in\nthe Level of the Free Women, and known there as Marguerite 78 K 4, but\nwho was born on the Royal Level as a daughter of Princess Fedora of\nthe House of Hohenzollern.\"\n\nA hush of consternation fell upon those about the table.\n\n\"Your petition,\" said the Emperor, \"cannot be granted.\"\n\n\"Then,\" I said, speaking with studied emphasis, \"I cannot proceed with\nthe work of extracting protium.\"\n\nAn angry cloud gathered on the face of Eitel I. \"Herr von Armstadt,\" he\nsaid, \"the title and awards which have just been conferred upon you are\nirrevocable. But if you decline to perform the duties of your office\nthose duties can be performed by others.\"\n\n\"But others cannot perform them,\" I replied. \"The demonstration I\nconducted was genuine, but the formulas I have given were not genuine.\nThe true formulas for my method of extracting protium are locked within\nmy brain and I will reveal them only when the petition I ask has\nbeen granted.\"\n\nAt these words the Emperor pounded on the table with a heavy fist. \"What\ndoes this mean?\" he demanded of the Chemical Staff.\n\n\"It is a lie,\" shouted the Chief of the Staff. \"We have the formulas and\nthey are correct, for we saw the demonstration conducted with the\ningredients stated in the formulas which Armstadt gave us.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" I cried; \"go try your formulas; go repeat the\ndemonstration, if you can.\"\n\nThe Emperor, glaring his rage, punched savagely at a signal button on\nthe arm of his chair.\n\nTwo palace guards answered the summons. \"Arrest this man,\" shouted His\nMajesty, \"and keep him in close confinement; permit him to see no one.\"\n\nWithout further ado I was led off by the guards, while the Emperor\nshouted imprecations at the Chemical Staff.\n\n~2~\n\nThe place to which I was conducted was a suite of rooms in a remote\ncorner of the Royal Palace. There was a large bedroom and bath, and a\nluxurious study or lounging room. Here I found a case of books, which\nproved to be novels bearing the imprint of the Royal Level.\n\nDespite the comfortable surroundings, it was evident that I was securely\nimprisoned, for the door was of metal, the ventilating gratings were\nlong narrow slits, and the walls were of heavy concrete--and there being\nno windows, no bars were needed. Any living apartment in the city would\nhave served equally well the jailor's purpose; for it were only\nnecessary to turn a key from without to make of it a cell in this\ngigantic prison of Berlin.\n\nThe regular appearance of my meals by mechanical carrier was the only\nway I had to reckon the passing of time, for it had chanced that I had\nforgotten my watch when dressing for the audience with His Majesty. I\nwrestled with unmeasured time by perusing the novels which gave me\nfragmentary pictures of the social life on the Royal Level.\n\nAs I turned over the situation in my mind I reassured myself that the\nsecrecy of my formulas was impregnable. The discovery of the process had\nbeen rendered possible by knowledge I had brought with me from the outer\nworld. The reagents that I had used were synthetic substances, the very\nexistence of which was unknown to the Germans. I had previously prepared\nthese compounds and had used and completely destroyed them in making the\ndemonstration, while I had taken pains to remove all traces of their\npreparation. Hence I had little to fear of the Chemical Staff\nduplicating my work, though doubtless they were making desperate efforts\nto do so, and my imprisonment was very evidently for the purpose of\npermitting them to make that effort.\n\nOn that score I felt that I had played my cards well, but there were\nother thoughts that troubled me, chief of which was a fear that some\ninvestigation might be set on foot in regard to Marguerite and that her\nguardianship of the library of forbidden books might be discovered. With\nthis worry to torment me, the hours dragged slowly enough.\n\nI had been some five days in this solitary confinement when the door\nopened and a man entered. He wore the uniform of a physician and\nintroduced himself as Dr. Boehm, explaining that he had been sent by His\nMajesty to look after my health. The idea rather amused me; at least, I\nthought, the Emperor had decided that the secrets of my brain were well\nworth preservation, and I reasoned that this was evidence that the\nChemical Staff had made an effort to duplicate my work and had reported\ntheir failure to do so.\n\nThe doctor made what seemed to me a rather perfunctory physical\nexamination, which included a very minute inspection of my eyes. Then he\nput me through a series of psychological test queries. When he had\nfinished he sighed deeply and said: \"I am sorry to find that you are\nsuffering from a disturbed balance of the altruistic and the egotistic\ncortical impulses; it is doubtless due to the intensive demands made upon\nthe creative potential before you were completely recovered from the\nsub-normal psychosis due to the gas attack in the potash mines.\"\n\nThis diagnosis impressed me as a palpable fraud, but I became genuinely\nalarmed at the mention of the affair at the potash mines. I was somewhat\nreassured at the thought that this reference was probably a part of the\nrecord of Karl Armstadt, which was doubtless on file at the medical\nheadquarters, and had been looked up by Dr. Boehm who was in need of\nmaking out a plausible case for some purpose--perhaps that of confining\nme permanently on the grounds of insanity. Whatever might be the move on\nfoot it was clearly essential for me to keep myself cool and well\nin hand.\n\nThe doctor, after eyeing me calmly for a few moments, said: \"It will be\nnecessary for me to go out for a time and secure apparatus for a more\nsearching examination. Meanwhile be assured you will not be further\nneglected. In fact, I shall arrange for the time to share your apartment\nwith you, as loneliness will aggravate your derangement.\"\n\nIn a few hours the doctor returned. He brought with him a\ncomplicated-looking apparatus and was followed by two attendants\ncarrying a bed.\n\nThe doctor pushed the apparatus into the corner, and, after seeing his\nbed installed in my sleeping chamber, dismissed the attendants and sat\ndown and began to entertain me with accounts of various cases of mental\nderangement that had come under his care. So far as I could determine\nhis object, if he had any other than killing time, it was to impress me\nwith the importance of submitting graciously to his care.\n\nTiring of these stories of the doctor's professional successes with meek\nand trusting patients, I took the management of the conversation into my\nown hands.\n\n\"Since you are a psychic expert, Dr. Boehm, perhaps you can explain to\nme the mental processes that cause a man to prize a large bank credit\nwhen there is positively no legal way in which he can expend\nthe credit.\"\n\nThe doctor looked at me quizzically. \"How do you mean,\" he asked, \"that\nthere is no legal way in which he can expend the credit?\"\n\n\"Well, take my own case. The Emperor has bestowed upon me a credit of a\nmillion marks a year. But I risked losing it by demanding that a young\nwoman of the Free Level be restored to the Royal Level where she\nwas born.\"\n\n\"Of this I am aware,\" replied the psychic physician. \"That is why His\nMajesty became alarmed lest your mental equilibrium be disturbed. It\nseems to indicate an atavistic reversion to a condition of romantic\naltruism, but as your pedigree is normal, I deem it merely a temporary\nloss of balance.\"\n\n\"But why,\" I asked, \"do you consider it abnormal at all? Is there\nevidence of any great degree of unselfishness in a man desiring the\nbestowal of happiness upon a particular woman in preference to bank\ncredit which he cannot expend? What should I do with a million marks a\nyear when I have been unable to expend the ten thousand a year I\nhave had?\"\n\n\"Ah,\" exclaimed the doctor, the light of a brilliant discovery breaking\nover his countenance. \"Perhaps this in a measure explains your case. You\nhave evidently been so absorbed in your work that you have not\nsufficiently developed your appetite for personal enjoyment.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I have not. But just how should I expend more funds; food,\nclothing, living quarters are all provided me, there is nothing but a few\ntawdry amusements that one can buy, nor is there any one to give the money\nto--even if a man had children they cannot inherit his wealth. Just what\nis money for, anyway?\"\n\nThe doctor nodded his head and smiled in satisfaction. \"You ask\ninteresting questions,\" he said. \"I shall try to answer them. Money or\nbank credit is merely a symbol of wealth. In ancient times wealth was\nrepresented by the private ownership of physical property, which was the\nbasis of capitalistic or competitive society. Racial progress was then\nachieved by the mating of the men of superior brain with the most\nbeautiful women. Women do not appreciate the mental power of man in its\ndirect expression, or even its social use; they can only comprehend that\npower when it is translated into wealth. After the destruction of\nprivate property women refused to accept as mates the men of\nintellectual power, but preferred instead men of physical strength and\npersonal beauty.\n\n\"At first this was considered to be a proof of the superiority of the\nproletariat. For, with all men economically equal, the beautiful women\nturned from the anemic intellectual and the sons of aristocracy, to the\nstrong arms of labour. Believing themselves to be the source of all\nwealth, and by that right vested with sole political power, and now\nfinding themselves preferred by the beautiful women, the labourer would\nsoon have eliminated all other classes from human society. Had unbridled\nsocialism with its free mating continued, we should have become merely a\nhorde of handsome savages.\n\n\"Such would have been the destiny of our race had not William III\nforeseen the outcome and restored war, the blessings of which had been\nall but lost to the world. The progress of peace depended upon the\ncompetition of capitalism, but in peace progress is incidental. In war\nit is essential. Because war requires invention, it saved the\nintellectual classes, and because war requires authority it made\npossible the restoration of our Royal House. Labour, the tyrant of\npeace, became again the slave of war, and under the plea of patriotic\nnecessity eugenics was established, which again restored the beautiful\nwomen to the superior men. And thus by Imperial Socialism the race was\npreserved from deterioriation.\"\n\n\"But surely,\" I said, \"eugenics has more than remedied this defect of\nsocialism, for the selection of men of superior mentality is much more\nrigid than it could have been under the capricious matings of\ncapitalistic society. Why then this need of wealth?\"\n\n\"Eugenics,\" replied Boehm, \"breeds superior children, but eugenic mating\nis a cold scientific thing which fails to fan the flame of man's\nambition to do creative work. That is why we have the Level of Free\nWomen and have not bred the virility out of the intellectual group. That\nis also the reason we have retained the Free Level on a competitive\ncommercial basis, and have given the intellectual man the bank credit, a\nsymbol of wealth, that he may use it, as men have always used wealth,\nfor the purpose of increasing his importance in the eyes of woman. This\nfunction of wealth is psychically necessary to the creative impulse, for\nthe power of sexual conquest and the stimulus to creative thought are\nbut different expressions of the same instinct. Wealth, or its symbol,\nis a medium of translating the one into the other. For example, take\nyour discovery; it is important to you and to the state. Your fellow\nscientists appreciate it, His Majesty appreciates it, but women cannot\nappreciate it. But give it a money value and women appreciate it\nimmediately. They know that the unlimited bank credit will give you the\npower to keep as many women on your list as you choose, and this means\nthat you can select freely those you wish. So the most attractive women\nwill compete for your preferment. We bow before the Emperor, we salute\nthe Statue of God, but we make out our checks to buy baubles for women,\nand it is that which keeps the wheels of progress turning.\"\n\n\"So,\" I said, \"this is your philosophy of wealth. I see, and yet I do\nnot see. The legal limit a man may contribute to a woman is but\ntwenty-four hundred marks a year, what then does he want with\na million?\"\n\n\"But there is no legal limit,\" replied the Doctor, \"to the number of\nwomen a man may have on his list. His relation to them may be the most\ncasual, but the pursuit is stimulating to the creative imagination. But\nyou forget, Herr von Armstadt, that with the compensation that was to be\nyours goes also the social privilege of the Royal Level. Evidently you\nhave been so absorbed in your research that you had no time to think of\nthe magnificent rewards for which you were working.\"\n\n\"Then perhaps you will explain them to me.\"\n\n\"With pleasure,\" said Dr. Boehm; \"your social privilege on the Royal\nLevel includes the right to marry and that means that you should have\nchildren for whom inheritance is permitted. How else did you suppose the\never-increasing numbers of the House of Hohenzollern should have\nmaintained their wealth?\"\n\n\"The question has never occurred to me,\" I answered, \"but if it had, I\nshould have supposed that their expenses were provided by appropriations\nfrom the state treasury.\"\n\nDr. Boehm chuckled. \"Then they should all be dependents on the state\nlike cripples and imbeciles. It would be a rather poor way to derive the\npride of aristocracy. That can only come from inherited wealth: the\nprinciple is old, very old. The nobleman must never needs work to live.\nThen, if he wishes to give service to the state, he may give it without\npay, and thus feel his nobility. You cannot aspire to full social\nequality with the Royal House both because you lack divinity of blood\nand because you receive your wealth for that which you have yourself\ngiven to the state. But because of your wealth you will find a wife of\nthe Royal House, and she will bear you children who, receiving the\ndivine blood of the Hohenzollerns from the mother and inherited wealth\nfrom the father, will thus be twice ennobled. To have such children is a\nrare privilege; not even Herr von Uhl with his thousands of descendants\ncan feel such a pride of paternity.\n\n\"It is well, Herr von Armstadt, that you talked to me of these matters.\nShould you be restored to your full mental powers and be permitted to\nassume the rights of your new station, it would be most unfortunate if\nyou should seem unappreciative of these ennobling privileges.\"\n\n\"Then, if I may, I shall ask you some further questions. It seems that\nthe inherited incomes of the Royal Level are from time to time\nreinforced by marriage from without. Does that not dilute the\nRoyal blood?\"\n\n\"That question,\" replied Dr. Boehm, \"more properly should be addressed\nto a eugenist, but I shall try to give you the answer. The blood of the\nHouse of Hohenzollern is of a very high order for it is the blood of\ndivinity in human veins. Yet since there is no eugenic control, no\nselection, the quality of that blood would deteriorate from inbreeding,\nwere there no fresh infusion. Then where better could such blood come\nthan from the men of genius? No man is given the full social privilege\nof the Royal Level except he who has made some great contribution to the\nstate. This at once marks him as a genius and gives his wealth a\nnoble origin.\"\n\n\"But how is it,\" I asked, \"that this addition of men from without does\nnot disturb the balance of the sexes?\"\n\n\"It does disturb it somewhat,\" replied the doctor, \"but not seriously,\nfor genius is rare. There are only a few hundred men in each generation\nwho are received into Royal Society. Of course that means some of the\nyoung men of the Royal Level cannot marry. But some men decline marriage\nof their own free will; if they are not possessed of much wealth they\nprefer to go unmarried rather than to accept an unattractive woman as a\nwife when they may have their choice of mistresses from the most\nbeautiful virgins intended for the Free Level. There is always an\nabundance of marriageable women on the Royal Level and with your wealth\nyou will have your choice. Your credit, in fact, will be the largest\nthat has been granted for over a decade.\"\n\n\"All that is very splendid,\" I answered. \"I was not well informed on\nthese matters. But why should His Majesty have been so incensed at my\nsimple request for the restoration of the rights of the daughter of the\nPrincess Fedora?\"\n\n\"Your request was unusual; pardon if I may say, impudent; it seems to\nimply a lack of appreciation on your part of the honours freely\nconferred upon you--but I daresay His Majesty did not realize your\nignorance of these things. You are very young and you have risen to your\nhigh station very quickly from an obscure position.\"\n\n\"And do you think,\" I asked, \"that if you made these facts clear to him,\nhe would relent and grant my request?\"\n\nDr. Boehm looked at me with a penetrating gaze. \"It is not my function,\"\nhe said, \"to intercede for you. I have only been commissioned to examine\ncarefully the state of your mentality.\"\n\nI smiled complacently at the psychic expert. \"Now, doctor,\" I said, \"you\ndo not mean to tell me that you really think there is anything wrong\nwith my mentality?\"\n\nA look of craftiness flashed from Boehm's eyes. \"I have given you my\ndiagnosis,\" he said, \"but it may not be final. I have already\ncommunicated my first report to His Majesty and he has ordered me to\nremain with you for some days. If I should alter that opinion too\nquickly it would discredit me and gain you nothing. You had best be\npatient, and submit gracefully to further examination and treatment.\"\n\n\"And do you know,\" I asked, \"what the chemical staff is doing about my\nformulas?\"\n\n\"That is none of my affair,\" declared Boehm, emphatically.\n\nThere was a vigour in his declaration and a haste with which he began to\ntalk of other matters that gave me a hint that the doctor knew more of\nthe doings of the chemical staff than he cared to admit, but I thought\nit wise not to press the point.\n\n~3~\n\nThe second day of Boehm's stay with me, he unmantled his apparatus and\nasked me to submit to a further examination. I had not the least\nconception of the purpose of this apparatus and with some misgivings I\nlay down on a couch while the psychic expert placed above my eyes a\nglass plate, on which, when he had turned on the current, there\nproceeded a slow rhythmic series of pale lights and shadows. At the\ndoctor's command I fixed my gaze upon the lights, while he, in a\nmonotonous voice, urged me to relax my mind and dismiss all\nactive thought.\n\nHow long I stood for this infernal proceeding I do not know. But I\nrecall a realization that I had lost grip on my thoughts and seemed to\nbe floating off into a misty nowhere of unconsciousness. I struggled\nfrantically to regain control of myself; and, for what seemed an\neternity, I fought with a horrible nightmare unable to move a muscle or\neven close my eyelids to shut out that sickening sequence of creeping\nshadows. Then I saw the doctor's hand reaching slowly toward my face. It\nseemed to sway in its stealthy movement like the head of a serpent\ncharming a bird, but in my helpless horror I could not ward it off.\n\nAt last the snaky fingers touched my eyelids as if to close them, and\nthat touch, light though it was, served to snap the taut film of my\nhelpless brain and I gave a blood-curdling yell and jumped up, knocking\nover the devilish apparatus and nearly upsetting the doctor.\n\n\"Calm yourself,\" said Boehm, as he attempted to push me again toward the\ncouch. \"There is nothing wrong, and you must surrender to the psychic\nequilibrator so that I can proceed with the examination.\"\n\n\"Examination be damned,\" I shouted fiercely; \"you were trying to\nhypnotize me with that infernal machine.\"\n\nBoehm did not reply but calmly proceeded to pick up the apparatus and\nrestore it to its place in the corner, while I paced angrily about the\nroom. He then seated himself and addressed me as I stood against the\nwall glaring at him. \"You are labouring under hallucinations,\" he said.\n\"I fear your case is even worse than I thought. But calm yourself. I\nshall attempt no further examination today.\"\n\nI resumed a seat but refused to look at him. He did not talk further of\nmy supposed mental state, but proceeded to entertain me with gossip of\nthe Royal Level, and later discussed the novels in the bookcase.\n\nIt was difficult to keep up an open war with so charming a\nconversationalist, but I was thoroughly on my guard. I could now readily\nsee through the whole fraud of my imputed mental derangement. I knew my\nmind was sound as a schoolboy's, and that this pretence of examination\nand treatment was only a blind. Evidently the Chemical Staff had failed\nto work the formulas I had given them and this psychic manipulator had\nbeen sent in here to filch the true formulas from my brain with his\ndevilish art. I knew nothing of what progress the Germans might have\nmade with hypnotism, but unless they had gone further than had the outer\nworld, now that I was on my guard, I believed myself to be safe.\n\nBut there was yet one danger. I might be trapped in my sleep by an\ninduced somnambulistic conversation. Happily I was fairly well posted on\nsuch things and believed that I could guard against that also. But the\nfear of the thing made me so nervous that I did not sleep all of the\nfollowing night.\n\nThe doctor, evidently a keen observer, must have detected that fact from\nthe sound of my breathing, for the lights were turned out and we slept\nin the pitchy blackness that only a windowless room can create.\n\n\"You did not sleep well,\" he remarked, as we breakfasted.\n\nBut I made light of his solicitous concern, and we passed another day in\ncasual conversation.\n\nAs the sleeping period drew again near, the doctor said, \"I will leave\nyou tonight, for I fear my presence disturbs you because you\nmisinterpret my purpose in observing you.\"\n\nAs the doctor departed, I noted that the mechanism of the hinges and the\nlock of the door were so perfect that they gave forth no sound. I was\nvery drowsy and soon retired, but before I went to sleep I practised\nsnapping off and on the light from the switch at the side of my bed.\nThen I repeated over and over to myself--\"I will awake at the first\nsound of a voice.\"\n\nThis thought ingrained in my subconscious mind proved my salvation. I\nmust have been sleeping some hours. I was dreaming of Marguerite. I saw\nher standing in an open meadow flooded with sunlight; and heard her\nvoice as if from afar. I walked towards her and as the words grew more\ndistinct I knew the voice was not Marguerite's. Then I awoke.\n\nI did not stir but lay listening. The voice was speaking monotonously\nand the words I heard were the words of the protium formulas, the false\nones I had given the Chemical Staff.\n\n\"But these formulas are not correct,\" purred the voice, \"of course, they\nare not correct. I gave them to the Staff, but they will never know the\nreal ones--Yes, the real ones--What are the real ones? Have I\nforgotten--? No, I shall never forget. I can repeat them now.\" Then the\nvoice began again on one of the fake formulas. But when it reached the\npoint where the true formula was different, it paused; evidently the\nChemical Staff had found out where the difficulty lay. And so the voice\nhad paused, hoping my sleeping mind would catch up the thread and supply\nthe missing words. But instead my arm shot quickly to the switch. The\nsolicitous Doctor Boehm, flooded with a blaze of light, glared\nblinkingly as I leaped from the bed.\n\n\"Oh, I was asleep all right,\" I said, \"but I awoke the instant I heard\nyou speak, just as I had assured myself that I would do before I fell\nasleep. Now what else have you in your bag of tricks?\"\n\n\"I only came--\" began the doctor.\n\n\"Yes, you only came,\" I shouted, \"and you knew nothing about the work of\nthe Chemical Staff on my formulas. Now see here, doctor, you had your\ntry and you have failed. Your diagnosis of my mental condition is just\nas much a fraud as the formulas on which the Chemical Staff have been\nwasting their time--only it is not so clever. I fooled them and you have\nnot fooled me. Waste no more time, but go back and report to His Majesty\nthat your little tricks have failed.\"\n\n\"I shall do that,\" said Boehm. \"I feared you from the start; your mind\nis really an extraordinary one. But where,\" he said, \"did you learn how\nto guard yourself so well against my methods? They are very secret. My\nart is not known even to physicians.\"\n\n\"It is known to me,\" I said, \"so run along and get your report ready.\"\nThe doctor shook my hand with an air of profound respect and took his\nleave. This time I balanced a chair overhanging the edge of a table so\nthat the opening of the door would push it off, and I lay down and\nslept soundly.\n\n~4~\n\nI was left alone in my prison until late the next day. Then came a guard\nwho conducted me before His Majesty. None of the Chemical Staff was\npresent. In fact there was no one with the Emperor but a single\nsecretary.\n\nHis Majesty smiled cordially. \"It was fitting, Herr von Armstadt, for me\nto order your confinement for your demand was audacious; not that what\nyou asked was a matter of importance, but you should have made the\nrequest in writing and privately and not before the Chemical Staff. For\nthat breach of etiquette I had to humiliate you that Royal dignity might\nbe preserved. As for the fact that you kept the formulas secret, none\nneed know that but the Chemical Staff and they will have nothing further\nto say since you made fools of them.\" His Majesty laughed.\n\n\"As for the request you made, I have decided to grant it. Nor do I blame\nyou for making it. The Princess Marguerite is a very beautiful girl. She\nis waiting now nearby. I should have sent for her sooner, but it was\nnecessary to make an investigation regarding her birth. The unfortunate\nPrincess Fedora never confessed the father. But I have arranged that, as\nyou shall see.\"\n\nThe Emperor now pressed his signal button and a door opened and\nMarguerite was ushered into the room. I started in fear as I saw that\nshe was accompanied by Dr. Zimmern. What calamity of discovery and\npunishment, I wondered, had my daring move brought to the secret rebel\nagainst the rule of the Hohenzollern?\n\nMarguerite stepped swiftly toward me and gave me her hand. The look in\nher eyes I interpreted as a warning that I was not to recognize Zimmern.\nSo I appeared the stranger while the secretary introduced us.\n\n\"Dr. Zimmern,\" said His Majesty, \"was physician to Princess Fedora at\nthe time of the birth of the Princess Marguerite. She confessed to him\nthe father of her child. It was the Count Rudolph who died unmarried\nsome years ago. There will be no questions raised. Our society will\nwelcome his daughter, for both the Count Rudolph and the Princess Fedora\nwere very popular.\"\n\nDuring this speech, Dr. Zimmern sat rigid and stared into space. Then\nthe secretary produced a document and read a confession to be signed by\nZimmern, testifying to these statements of Marguerite's birth.\n\nZimmern, his features still unmoved, signed the paper and handed it\nagain to the secretary.\n\nHis Majesty arose and held out his hand to Marguerite. \"I welcome you,\"\nhe said, \"to the House of Hohenzollern. We shall do our best to atone\nfor what you have suffered. And to you, Herr von Armstadt, I extend my\nthanks for bringing us so beautiful a woman. It is my hope that you will\nwin her as a wife, for she will grace well the fortune that your great\ngenius brings to us. But because you have loved her under unfortunate\ncircumstances I must forbid your marriage for a period of two years.\nDuring that time you will both be free to make acquaintances in Royal\nSociety. Nothing less than this would be fair to either of you, or to\nother women that may seek your fortune or to other men who may seek the\nbeauty of your princess.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nA GODDESS WHO IS SUFFERING FROM OBESITY AND\nA BRAVE MAN WHO IS AFRAID OF THE LAW OF AVERAGES\n\n\n~1~\n\nIt was not till we had reached Marguerite's apartment that Zimmern\nspoke. Then he and Marguerite both embraced me and cried with joy.\n\n\"Ah, Armstadt,\" said the old doctor, \"you have done a wonderful thing, a\nwonderful thing, but why did you not warn us?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I stammered, \"I know. You mean the books. It worried me, but, you\nsee, I did not plan this thing. I did not know what I should do. It came\nto me like a flash as the Emperor was conferring the honours upon me. I\nhad hoped to use my power to make him do my bidding, and yet we had\ncontrived no way to use that power in furtherance of our great plans to\nfree a race; but I could at least use it to free a woman. Let us hope\nthat it augurs progress to the ultimate goal.\"\n\n\"It was very noble, but it was dangerous,\" replied Zimmern. \"It was only\nthrough a coincidence that we were saved. Herr von Uhl told me that same\nday what you had demanded. I saw Hellar immediately and he declared a\nraid on Marguerite's apartment. But he came himself with only one\nassistant who is in his confidence, and they boxed the books and carted\nthem off. They will be turned in as contraband volumes, but the report\nwill be falsified; no one will ever know from whence they came.\"\n\n\"Then the books are lost to you,\" I said; \"of that I am sorry, and I\nworried greatly while I was imprisoned.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Zimmern, \"we have lost the books, but you have saved\nMarguerite. That will more than compensate. For that I can never thank\nyou enough.\"\n\n\"And you were called into the matter, not,\" I said, \"as Marguerite's\nfriend, but as the physician to her mother?\"\n\n\"They must have looked up the record,\" replied Zimmern, \"but nothing was\nsaid to me. I received only a communication from His Majesty commanding\nme as the physician to Marguerite's mother at the time of Marguerite's\nbirth, to make statement as to her fatherhood.\"\n\n\"But why,\" I asked, \"did you not make this confession before, since it\nenabled Marguerite to be restored to her rights?\"\n\nThe old doctor looked pained at the question. \"But you forget,\" he said,\n\"that it is the power of your secret and not my confession that has\nrestored Marguerite. The confession is only a matter of form, to satisfy\nthe wagging tongues of Royal Society.\"\n\n\"Do you mean,\" I asked, \"that she will not be well received there\nbecause she was born out of wedlock?\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" replied Zimmern; \"it was the failure to confess the\nfather, not the fact of her unwedded motherhood, that brought the\npunishment. There are many love-children born on the Royal Level and\nthey suffer only a failure of inheritance of wealth from the father. But\nif they be girls of charm and beauty, and if, as Marguerite now stands\ncredited, they be of rich Royal blood, they are very popular and much\nsought after. But without the record of the father they cannot be\nadmitted into Royal Society, for the record of the blood lines would be\nlost, and that, you see, is essential. Social precedent, the value in\nthe matrimonial market, all rest upon it. Marguerite is indeed\nfortunate; with His Majesty's signature attesting my confession, she has\nnothing more to fear. But I daresay they shall try their best to win her\nfrom you for some shallow-minded prince.\"\n\n\"But when,\" I asked, \"is she to go? His Majesty seemed very gracious,\nbut do you realize that I still possess my secret of the protium\nformulas?\"\n\n\"And do you still hesitate to give them up?\" asked Marguerite.\n\n\"For your freedom, dear, I shall reveal them gladly.\"\n\n\"But,\" cried Marguerite, \"you must not give them up just for me,--if\nthere is any way you can use them for our great plan.\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" spoke up Zimmern, \"could be gained now by further secrecy but\ntrouble for us all; and by acceding, both you and Marguerite win your\nplaces on the Royal Level, where you can better serve our cause. That\nis, if you are still with us. It may be harder for you, now that you\nhave won the richest privileges that Germany has to offer, to remember\nthose who struggle in the darkness.\"\n\n\"But I shall remember,\" I said, giving him my hand.\n\n\"I believe you will,\" said Zimmern feelingly, \"and I know I can count on\nMarguerite. You will both have opportunities to see much of the officers\nof the Submarine Service. The German race may yet be freed from this\nsunless prison, if you can find one among them who can be won to\nour cause.\"\n\n~2~\n\nI reported the next morning to the Chemical Staff, by whom I was treated\nwith deferential respect. I was immediately installed in my new office,\nas Director of the Protium Works. While I set about supervising the\nmanufacture of apparatus for the new process, other members of the\nstaff, now furnished with the correct formulas repeated the\ndemonstration without my assistance.\n\nWhen the report of this had been made to His Majesty, I received my\ninsignia of the social privilege of the Royal Level and a copy of the\nRoyal Society Bulletin announcing Marguerite's restoration to her place\nin the House of Hohenzollern, with the title of Princess Marguerite,\nDaughter of Princess Fedora and Count Rudolf. The next day a social\nsecretary from the Royal Level came for Marguerite and conducted her to\nthe Apartments of the Countess Luise, under whose chaperonage she was to\nmake her d\u00e9but into Royal Society.\n\nI, also, was furnished with a social secretary, an obsequious but very\nwise little man, who took charge of all my affairs outside my chemical\nwork. Under his guidance I was removed to more commodious quarters and\nmy wardrobe was supplied with numerous changes all in the uniform of the\nChemical Staff. There was little time to spare from my duties in the\nProtium Works, but my secretary, ever alert, snatched upon the odd\nmoments to coach me in matters of social etiquette and so prepared me to\nmake my first appearance in Royal Society at the grand ball given by the\nCountess Luise in honour of Marguerite's d\u00e9but.\n\nDespite the assiduous coaching of my secretary, my ignorance must have\nbeen delightfully amusing to the royal idlers who had little other\nthought or purpose in life than this very round of complicated\nnothingness. But if I was a blundering amateur in all this, they were\nnot so much discourteous as envious. They knew that I had won my\nposition by my achievements as a chemist and in a vague way they\nunderstood that I had saved the empire from impending ruin, and for this\nachievement I was lionized.\n\nThe women rustled about me in their gorgeous gowns and plied me with\nfoolish questions which I had better sense than to try to answer with\nthe slightest degree of truth. But their power of sustained interest in\nsuch weighty matters was not great and soon the conversation would drift\naway, especially if Marguerite was about, when the talk would turn to\nthe romance of her restoration.\n\nOne group of vivacious ladies discussed quite frankly with Marguerite\nthe relative advantages of a husband of intellectual genius as compared\nwith one of a high degree of royal blood. Some contended that the added\nprospect of superior intelligence in the children would offset the\nlowering of their degree of Hohenzollern blood. The others argued quite\nas persistently that the \"blood\" was the better investment.\n\nThrough such conversation I learned of the two clans within the Royal\nHouse. The one prided themselves wholly in the high degree of their\nHohenzollern blood; the other, styling themselves \"Royal Intellectuals\"\nbecause of a greater proportion of outside blood lines, were quite as\nproud of the fact that, while possessed of sufficient royal blood to be\nin \"the divinity,\" they inherited supposedly greater intelligence from\ntheir mundane ancestors. This latter group, to make good their claims,\nmade a great show of intellectuality, and cultivated most persistently a\ndilletante dabbling into all sorts of scientific and artistic matters.\n\nBecause of Marguerite's high credit in Royal blood she was courted by\n\"purists\" by whom I was only tolerated on her account. On the other\nhand, the \"intellectuals\" considered me as a great asset for their cause\nand glorified particularly in the prospects of marriage of an outside\nscientist to an eighty-degree Hohenzollern princess. This rivalry of the\nclans of Royal Society made us much sought after and I was flooded with\ninvitations.\n\nIt did not take me long to discover, however, that the reason for my\npopularity was not altogether a matter of respect for my intellectual\ngenius. I had at first been inclined to accept all invitations,\ninnocently supposing that I was being f\u00eated as an honorary guest. But my\nsocial secretary advised against this; and, when he began bringing me\nchecks to sign, I realized that the social privileges of Royal Society\nincluded the honour of paying the bills for one's own entertainment.\n\nI had already arranged with my banker that a fourth of my income be\nturned over to Marguerite until her marriage, for she was without income\nof her own, and it was upon my petition that she had been restored to\nthe Royal Level. At my banker's suggestion I had also made over ten\nthousand marks a month to the Countess, under whose motherly wing\nMarguerite was being sheltered. I therefore soon discovered that my\nincome of a million marks a year would be absorbed quite easily by Royal\nSociety. The entire system appeared to me rather sordid, but such\nmatters were arranged by bankers and secretaries and the principals were\nsupposed to be quite innocent of any knowledge of, or concern for,\nthe details.\n\nThe Countess Luise, who was permitted to entertain so lavishly at my\nexpense, was playing for the favour of both of the opposing social\nclans. Possessing a high degree of Hohenzollern blood she stood well\nwith the purists. But her income was not all that could be desired, so\nshe had adroitly discovered in her only son a touch of intellectual\ngenius, and the young man quite dutifully had become a maker of picture\nplots, hoping by this distinction to win as a wife one of the daughters\nof some wealthy intellectual interloper. At first I had feared the\nCountess had designs upon Marguerite as a wife for her son, but as\nMarguerite had no income of her own I saw that in this I was mistaken,\nand I developed a feeling of genuine friendliness for the plump and\ncordial Countess.\n\n\"Do you know what I was reading last night?\" I remarked one evening, as\nI chatted with Marguerite and her chaperone.\n\n\"Some work on obesity, I hope,\" sparkled the Countess. Like many of the\nHouse of Hohenzollern, among whom there was no weight control, she\ncarried a surplus of adipose tissue not altogether consistent\nwith beauty.\n\n\"No, indeed,\" I said gravely. \"Nothing about your material being, but a\ntreatise upon your spiritual nature. I was reading an old school book\nthat I found among my forgotten relics--a book about the Divinity of the\nHouse of Hohenzollern.\"\n\n\"Oh, how jolly!\" chuckled the Countess. \"How very funny that I never\nthought before that you, Herr von Armstadt, were once taught all those\ndelightful fables.\"\n\n\"And once believed them too,\" I lied.\n\n\"Oh, dear me,\" replied the Countess, with a ponderous sigh, \"so I\nsuppose you did. And what a shock I must have been to you with an eighty\ncentimetre waist.\"\n\n\"You are not quite Junoesque,\" I admitted.\n\n\"The more reason you should use your science, Herr Chemist, to aid me to\nrecover my goddess form.\"\n\n\"What are you folks talking about?\" interrupted Marguerite.\n\n\"About our divinity, my dear,\" replied Luise archly.\n\n\"But do you feel that it is really necessary,\" I asked, \"that such\nfables should be put into the helpless minds of children?\"\n\n\"It surely must be. Suppose your own heredity had proven tricky--it does\nsometimes, you know--and you had been found incapable of scientific\nthought. You would have been deranked and perhaps made a record\nclerk--no personal reflections, but such things do happen--and if you\nnow were filing cards all day you would surely be much happier if you\ncould believe in our divinity. Why else would you submit to a loveless\nlife and the dull routine of toil? Did not all the ancients, and do not\nall the inferior races now, have objects of religious worship?\"\n\n\"But the other races,\" I said, \"do not worship living people but\nspiritual divinities and the sainted dead.\n\n\"Quite so,\" replied the over-plump goddess, \"but that is why their\n_kulturs_ are so inefficient. Surely the worship was useless to the\nspirits and the dead, whereas we find it quite profitable to be\nworshipped. But for this wonderful doctrine of the divinity of the blood\nof William the Great we should be put to all sorts of inconveniences.\"\n\n\"You might even have to work,\" I ventured.\n\nThe Countess bestowed on me one of her most bewitching smiles. \"My dear\nHerr Chemist,\" she said in sugary tones, \"you with your intellectual\ngenius can twit us on our psychic lacks and we must fall back on the\ndivine blood of our Great Ancestor--but would you really wish the slaves\nof dull toil to think it as human as their own?\"\n\n\"But to me it seems a little gross,\" I said.\n\n\"Not at all; on the contrary, it is a master stroke of science and\nefficiency--inferior creatures must worship; they always have and always\nwill--then why waste the worship?\"\n\n~3~\n\nMy position as director of the protium works soon brought me into\nconference with Admiral von Kufner who was Chief of the Submarine Staff.\nVon Kufner was in his forties and his manner indicated greater talent\nfor pomp and ceremony than for administrative work. His grandfather had\nbeen the engineer to whose genius Berlin owed her salvation through the\nconstruction of the submarine tunnel. By this service the engineer had\nwon the coveted \"von,\" a princely fortune and a wife of the Royal Level.\nThe Admiral therefore carried Hohenzollern blood in his veins, which,\ntogether with his ample fortune and a distinguished position, made him a\nman of both social and official consequence.\n\nIt did not take me long to decide that von Kufner was hopeless as a\nprospective convert to revolutionary doctrines. Nor did he possess any\ngreat knowledge of the protium mines, for he had never visited them.\nInheriting his position as an honour to his grandfather's genius, he\ncommanded the undersea vessels from the security of an office on the\nRoyal Level, for journeys in ice-filled waters were entirely too\ndangerous to appeal to one who loved so well the pleasures and\nvanities of life.\n\nI had explained to von Kufner the distinctions I had discovered in the\nvarious samples of the ore brought from the mines and the necessity of\nhaving new surveys of the deposits made on the basis of these\ndiscoveries. After he had had time to digest this information, I\nsuggested that I should myself go to make this survey. But this idea the\nAdmiral at once opposed, insisting that the trip through the Arctic ice\nfields was entirely too dangerous.\n\n\"Very well,\" I replied. \"I feel that I could best serve Germany by going\nto the Arctic mines in person, but if you think that is unwise, will you\nnot arrange for me to consult at once with men who have been in the\nmines and are familiar with conditions there?\"\n\nTo this very reasonable request, which was in line with my obvious\nduties, no objection could be made and a conference was at once called\nof submarine captains and furloughed engineers who had been in the\nArctic ore fields.\n\nI was impressed by the youthfulness of these men, which was readily\nexplained by the fact that one vessel out of every five sent out was\nlost beneath the Arctic ice floes. With an almost mathematical certainty\nthe men in the undersea service could reckon the years of their lives on\nthe fingers of one hand.\n\nAlthough the official business of the conference related to ore deposits\nand not to the dangers of the traffic, the men were so obsessed with the\nlatter fact, that it crept out in their talk in spite of the Admiral's\nobvious displeasure at such confession of fear. I particularly marked\nthe outspoken frankness of one, Captain Grauble, whose vessel was the\nnext one scheduled to depart to the mines.\n\nI therefore asked Grauble to call in person at my office for the\ninstructions concerning the ore investigations which were to be\nforwarded to the Director of the Mines. Free from the restraining\ninfluence of the Admiral, I was able to lead the Captain to talk freely\nof the dangers of his work, and was overjoyed to find him frankly\nrebellious.\n\nThat I might still further cultivate his acquaintance I withheld some of\nthe necessary documents; and, using this as a pretext, I later sought\nhim out at his quarters, which were in a remote and somewhat obscure\npart of the Royal Level.\n\nThe official nature of my call disposed of, I led the conversation into\nsocial matters, and found no difficulty in persuading the Captain to\ntalk of his own life. He was a man well under thirty and like most of\nhis fellows in the service was one of the sons of a branch of the\nHohenzollern family whose declining fortune denied him all hope of\nmarriage or social life. In the heroic years of his youth he had\nvolunteered for the submarine service. But now he confessed that he\nregretted the act, for he realized that his death could not be long\npostponed. He had made his three trips as commander of an\nore-bringing vessel.\n\n\"I have two more trips,\" declared Captain Grauble. \"Such is the prophecy\nof statistical facts: five trips is the allotted life of a Captain; it\nis the law of averages. It is possible that I may extend that number a\nlittle, but if so it will be an exception. Trusting to exceptions is a\npoor philosophy. I do not like it. Sometimes I think I shall refuse to\ngo. Disgrace, of course,--banishment to the mines. Report my treasonable\nutterances if you like. I am prepared for that; suicide is easy\nand certain.\"\n\n\"But is it not rather cowardly, Captain?\" I asked, looking him steadily\nin the eye.\n\nGrauble flung out his hand with a gesture of disdain. \"That is an easy\nword for you to pronounce,\" he sneered. \"You have hope to live by, you\nare on the upward climb, you aspire to marry into the Royal House and\nsire children to inherit your wealth. But I was born of the Royal House,\nmy father squandered his wealth. My sisters were beautiful and they have\nmarried well. My brother was servile; he has attached himself to the\nretinue of a wealthy Baroness. But I was made of better stuff than that.\nI would play the hero. I would face danger and gladly die to give Berlin\nmore life and uphold the House of Hohenzollern in its fat and idle\nexistence; and for me they have taken hope away!\n\n\"Oh, yes, I was proclaimed a hero. The young ladies of this house of\nidleness dance with me, but they dare not take me seriously; what one of\nthem would court the certainty of widowhood without a fortune? So why\nshould I not tire of their shallow trifling? I find among the girls of\nthe Free Level more honest love, for they, as I, have no hope. They love\nbut for the passing hour, and pass on as I pass on, I to death, they to\ndecaying beauty and an old age of servile slavery.\"\n\nSurely, I exulted, here is the rebellious and daring soul that Zimmern\nand Hellar have sought in vain. Even as they had hoped, I seemed to have\ndiscovered a man of the submarine service who was amenable to\nrevolutionary ideas. Could I not get him to consider the myriad life of\nBerlin in all its barren futility, to grasp at the hope of succour from\na free and merciful world, and then, with his aid, find a way out of\nBerlin, a way to carry the message of Germany's need of help to the\nGreat God of Humanity that dwelt without in the warmth and joy of\nthe sun?\n\nThe tide of hope surged high within me. I was tempted to divulge at once\nmy long cherished plan of escape from Berlin. \"Why,\" I asked, thinking\nto further sound his sincerity, \"if you feel like this, have you never\nconsidered running your craft to the surface during the sea passage and\nbeaching her on a foreign shore? There at least is life and hope and\nexperience.\"\n\n\"By the Statue of God!\" cried Grauble, his body shaking and his voice\nquavering, \"why do you, in all your hope and comfort here, speak of that\nto me? Do you think I have never been tempted to do that very thing? And\nyet you call me a coward. Have I not breathed foul air for days, fearful\nto poke up our air tube in deserted waters lest by the millionth chance\nit might lead to a capture? And yet you speak of deliberate surrender!\nEven though I destroyed my charts, the capture of a German submarine in\nthose seas would set the forces of the outer world searching for the\npassage. If they found and blocked the passage I should be guilty of the\ndestruction of three hundred million lives--Great God! God of\nHohenzollern! God of the World! could this thing be?\"\n\n\"Captain,\" I said, placing my hand on the shoulder of the palsied man,\n\"you and I have great secrets and the burden of great sorrows in common.\nIt is well that we have found each other. It is well that we have spoken\nof these things that shake our souls. You have confessed much to me and\nI have much that I shall confess to you. I must see you again before\nyou leave.\"\n\nGrauble gave me his hand. \"You are a strange man,\" he said. \"I have met\nnone before like you. I do not know at what aims you are driving. If you\nplotted my disgrace by leading me into these confessions, you have found\nme easy prey. But do not credit yourself too much. I have often vowed I\nwould go to Admiral von Kufner, and say these things to him. But the\nformal exterior of that petty pompous man I cannot penetrate. If I have\nconfessed to you, it is merely because you are a man without that\nprotecting shield of bristling authority and cold formality. You seemed\nmerely a man of flesh and blood, despite your decorations, and so I have\ntalked. What is to be made of it by you or by me I do not know, but I am\nnot afraid of you.\"\n\n\"I shall leave you now,\" I said, \"for I have pressing duties, but I\nshall see you soon again. So calm yourself and get hold of your reason.\nI shall want you to think clearly when I talk with you again. Perhaps I\ncan yet show you a gleam of hope beyond this mathematical law of\naverages that rattles the dice of death.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nIN WHICH THE TALKING DELEGATE IS ANSWERED BY THE\nROYAL VOICE AND I LEARN THAT LABOUR KNOWS NOT GOD\n\n\n~1~\n\nI had delayed in speaking to Grauble of our revolutionary plans, because\nI wished first to arrange a meeting with Zimmern and Hellar and secure\nthe weight of their calmer minds in initiating Grauble into our plans of\nsending a message to the World State authorities. I was prevented from\ndoing this immediately by difficulties in the Protium Works. Meanwhile\nunbeknown to me the sailing date of Grauble's vessel was advanced, and\nhe departed to the Arctic.\n\nAlthough my position as Director of the Protium Works had been more of\nan honour than an assignment of active duties, I made it my business to\nassume the maximum rather than the minimum of the functions of the\noffice as I wished to learn more of the labour situation in Berlin, of\nwhich as yet I had no comprehensive understanding.\n\nIn a general way I understood that German labour differed not only in\nbeing eugenically created as a distinct breed, but that the labour group\nwas also a very distinct caste economically and politically. The\nlabourer, being denied access to the Level of Free Women, had no need\nfor money or bank credit in any form. This seemed to me to reduce him to\na condition of pure slavery--since he received no pay for his services\nother than the bare maintenance supplied by the state.\n\nBecause of this evidence of economic inferiority, I had at first\nsupposed that labour was in every way an inferior caste. But in this I\nhad been gravely mistaken, nor had I been able fully to comprehend my\nerror until this brewing labour trouble revealed in concrete form the\npolitical superiority of labour. In my failure to comprehend the true\nstate of affairs I had been a little stupid, for the political basis of\nGerman society is revealed to the seeing eye in the Hohenzollern eagle\nemblazoned on the red flag, the emblem of the rule of labour.\n\nHistorically I believe this belies the origin of the red flag for it was\nfirst used as the emblem of democratic socialism, a Nineteenth Century\ntheory of a social order in which all social and economic classes were\nto be blended into a true democracy differing somewhat in its economic\norganization, but essentially the same politically as the true democracy\nwhich we have achieved in the World State. But with the Bolshevist\nr\u00e9gime in Russia after the First World War, the red flag was\nappropriated as the emblem of the political supremacy and rule of the\nproletariat or labour class.\n\nI make these references to bygone history because they throw light on\nthe peculiar status of the German Labour Caste, which is possessed of\npolitical superiority combined with social and economic inferiority. It\nwas the Bolshevist brand of socialism that finally overran Germany in\nthe era of loose and ineffective rule of the world by the League of\nNations. Though I make no pretence of being an accurate authority on\nhistory, the League of Nations, if I remember rightly, was humanity's\nfirst timid conception of the World State. Rather weakly born, it was\npromptly emasculated by the rise in America of a political party founded\non the ideas of a great national hero who had just died. The\nobstructionist policy of this party was inherent in its origin, for it\nwas inspired and held together by the ideas of a dead man, whose\nfollowers could only repeat as their test of faith a phrase that has\ncome down to us as an idiom--\"What would He do?\"\n\n\"He\" being dead could do nothing, neither could he change his mind, but\nhaving left an indelible record of his ideas by the strenuous verbiage\nof his virile and inspiring rhetoric, there was no room for doubt. As in\nall political and religious faiths founded on the ideas of dead heroes,\nthis made for solidarity and power and quite prevented any adaptation of\nthe form of government to the needs of the world that had arisen since\nhis demise.\n\nI have digressed here from my theme of the political status of the\nGerman labour caste, but it is fascinating to trace things to their\norigin to find the links of the chain of cause and effect. So, if I have\nread my history aright, the emasculation of the League of Nations by the\nAmerican obstructionists caused, or at least permitted the rise, and\ndominance of the Bolshevists in Twentieth-Century Germany. Had the\nGermans been democrats at heart the pendulum would have swung back as it\ndid with other peoples, and been stayed at the point of equilibrium\nwhich we recognized as the stable mean of democracy.\n\nBut in the old days before the modern intermingling of the races it\nseems that there were certain tastes that had become instinctive in\nracial groups. Thus, just as the German stomach craved the rich flavour\nof sausage, so the German mind craved the dazzling show of Royal\nflummery. Had it not been for this the First World War could have never\nbeen, for the socialists of that time were bitterly opposed to war and\nGermany was the world's greatest stronghold of socialism, yet when their\nbeloved imperial poser, William the Great, called for war the German\nsocialists, with the exception of a few whom they afterwards murdered,\nwent forth to war almost without protest.\n\nWhen I first began to hear of the political rights of Labour, I went to\nmy friend Hellar and asked for an explanation.\n\n\"Is not the chain of authority absolute,\" I asked, \"up through the\nindustrial organization direct to the Emperor and so to God himself?\"\n\n\"But,\" said Hellar, \"the workers do not believe in God!\"\n\n\"What,\" I stammered, \"workers not believe in God! It is impossible. Have\nnot the workers simple trusting minds?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Hellar, \"it is the natural mind of man! Scepticism,\nwhich is the basis of scientific reasoning, is an artificial thing,\nfirst created in the world under the competitive economic order when it\nbecame essential to self-preservation in a world of trade based on\ndeceit. In our new order we have had difficulty in maintaining enough of\nit for scientific purposes even in the intellectual classes. There is no\nscepticism among the labourers now, I assure you. They believe as easily\nas they breathe.\"\n\n\"Then how,\" I demanded in amazement, \"does it come that they do not\nbelieve in God?\"\n\n\"Because,\" said Hellar, \"they have never heard of God.\n\n\"The labourer does not know of God because we have restored God since\nthe perfection of our caste system, and hence it was easy to promulgate\nthe idea among the intellectuals and not among the workers. It was\nnecessary to restore God for the intellectuals in order to give them\ngreater respect for the power of the Royal House, but the labourers need\nno God because they believe themselves to be the source from which the\nRoyal House derives its right to rule. They believe the Emperor to be\ntheir own servant ruling by their permission.\"\n\n\"The Emperor a servant to labour!\" I exclaimed; \"this is absurd.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Hellar; \"why should it be otherwise? We are an absurd\npeople, because we have always laughed at the wrong things. Still this\nprinciple is very old and has not always been confined to the Germans.\nAfter the revolutions in the Twentieth Century the American plutocrats\nemployed poverty-stricken European nobility for servants and exalted\nthem to high stations and obeyed them explicitly in all social matters\nwith which their service was concerned.\n\n\"The labourers restored William III because they wished to have an\nexalted servant. He led them to war and became a hero. He reorganized\nthe state and became their political servant, also their emperor and\ntheir tyrant. It is not an impossible relation, for it is not unlike the\nrelation between the mother and the child or between a man and his\nmistress. And yet it is different, more formal, with functions\nbetter defined.\n\n\"The Emperor is the administrative head of the government and we\nintellectuals are merely his hirelings. We are merely the feathers of\nthe Royal eagle, our colour is black, we have no part in the red blood\nof human brotherhood, we are outcasts from the socialistic labour\nworld--for we receive money compensation to which labourers would not\nstoop. But labour owns the state. This roof of Berlin over our heads and\nall that is therein contained, is the property of the workers who\nproduced it.\"\n\nI shook my head in mute admission of my lack of comprehension.\n\n\"And who,\" asked Hellar, \"did you think owned Berlin?\"\n\nI confessed that I had never thought of that.\n\n\"Few of our intellectual class have ever thought of that,\" replied\nHellar, \"unless they are well read in political history. But at the time\nof the Hohenzollern restoration labour owned all property in true\ncommunal ownership. They did not release it to the Royal House, but\nmerely turned over the administration of the property to the Emperor as\nan agent.\"\n\nThese belated explanations of the fundamental ideas of German society\nquite confused and confounded me, though Hellar seemed in no wise\nsurprised at my ignorance, since as a chemist I had originally been\nsupposed to know only of atoms and valences and such like matters.\nSeeking a way out of these contradictions I asked: \"How is it then that\nlabour is so powerless, since you say that it owns the state, and even\nthe Emperor rules by its permission?\"\n\n\"Napoleon--have you ever heard of him?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I admitted--and then recalling my r\u00f4le as a German chemist I\nhastened to add--\"Napoleon was a directing chemist who achieved a plan\nfor increasing the food supply in his day by establishing the sugar beet\nindustry.\"\n\n\"Is that so?\" exclaimed Hellar. \"I didn't know that. I thought he was\nonly an Emperor--anyway, Napoleon said that if you tell men they are\nequal you can do as you please with them. So when William III was\nelected to the throne by labour, he insisted that they retain the power\nand re-elect him every five years. He was very popular because he\ninvented the armoured city--our new Berlin--some day I will tell you of\nthat--and so of course he was re-elected, and his son after him. Though\nmost of the intellectuals do not know that it exists the ceremony of\nelection is a great occasion on the labour levels. The Emperor speaks\nall day through the horns and on the picture screens. The workers think\nhe is actually speaking, though of course it is a collection of old\nfilms and records of the Royal Voice. When they have seen and heard the\nspeeches, the labourers vote, and then go back to their work and are\nvery happy.\"\n\n\"But suppose they should sometime fail to re-elect him?\"\n\n\"No danger,\" said Hellar; \"there is only one name on the ballot and the\nballots are dumped into the paper mill without inspection.\"\n\n\"Most extraordinary,\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Most ordinary,\" contradicted Hellar; \"it is not even an exclusively\nGerman institution; we have merely perfected it. Voting everywhere is a\nvery useful device in organized government. In the cruder form used in\ndemocracies there were two or more candidates. It usually made little\ndifference which was elected; but the system was imperfect because the\nvoters who voted for the candidate which lost were not pleased. Then\nthere was the trouble of counting the ballots. We avoid all this.\"\n\n\"It is all very interesting,\" I said, \"but who is the real authority?\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Hellar, \"this matter of authority is one of our most subtle\nconceptions. The weakness of ancient governments was in the fact that\nthe line of authority was broken. It came somewhere to an end. But now\nauthority flows up from labour to the Emperor and then descends again to\nlabour through the administrative line of which we are one link. It is\nan unbroken circuit.\"\n\nBut I was still unsatisfied, for it annoyed me not to be able to\nunderstand the system of German politics, as I had always prided myself\nthat, for a scientist, I understood politics remarkably well.\n\n~2~\n\nI had gone to Hellar for enlightenment because I was gravely alarmed\nover the rumours of a strike among the labourers in the Protium Works. I\nhad read in the outside world of the murder and destruction of these\nformer civil wars of industry. With a working population so cruelly held\nto the treadmill of industrial bondage the idea of a strike conjured up\nin my fancy the beginning of a bloody revolution. With so vast a\npopulation so utterly dependent upon the orderly processes of industry\nthe possible terrors of an industrial revolution were horrible beyond\nimagining; and for the moment all thoughts of escape, or of my own plans\nfor negotiating the surrender of Berlin to the World State, were swept\naside by the stern responsibilities that devolved upon me as the\nDirector of Works wherein a terrible strike seemed brewing.\n\nThe first rumour of the strike of the labourers in the Protium Works had\ncome to me from the Listening-in-Service. Since Berlin was too\ncomplicated and congested a spot for wireless communication to be\npractical, the electrical conduct of sound was by antiquated means of\nmetal wires. The workers' Free Speech Halls were all provided with\nreceiving horns by which they made their appeals to His Majesty, of\nwhich I shall speak presently. These instruments were provided with\ncut-offs in the halls. They had been so designed by the electrical\nengineers, who were of the intellectual caste, that not even the workers\nwho installed and repaired them knew that the cut-offs were a blind and\nthat the Listening-in-Service heard every word that was said at their\nsecret meetings, when all but workers were, by law and custom, excluded\nfrom the halls.\n\nAnd so the report came to me that the workers were threatening strike.\nTheir grievance came about in this fashion. My new process had reduced\nthe number of men needed in the works. This would require that some of\nthe men be transferred to other industries. But the transfer was a slow\nprocess, as all the workers would have to be examined anatomically and\ntheir psychic reflexes tested by the labour assignment experts and those\nselected re-trained for other labour. That work was proceeding\nslowly, for there was a shortage of experts because some similar need of\ntransfers existed in one of the metal industries. Moreover, my labour\npsychologist considered it dangerous to transfer too many men, as they\nwere creatures of habit, and he advised that we ought merely to cease to\ntake on new workers, but wait for old age and death to reduce the number\nof our men, meanwhile retaining the use of the old extraction process in\npart of the works.\n\n\"Impossible,\" I replied, \"unless you would have your rations cut and the\ncity put on a starvation diet. Do you not know that the reserve store of\nprotium that was once enough to last eight years is now reduced to less\nthan as many months' supply?\"\n\n\"That is none of my affair,\" said the labour psychologist; \"these\nchemical matters I do not comprehend. But I advise against these\ntransfers, for our workers are already in a furor about the change of\noperations in the work.\"\n\n\"But,\" I protested, \"the new operations are easier than the old; besides\nwe can cut down the speed of operations, which ought to help you take\ncare of these surplus men.\"\n\n\"Pardon, Herr Chief,\" returned the elderly labour psychologist, \"you are\na great chemist, a very great chemist, for your invention has upset the\nlabour operation more than has anything that ever happened in my long\nexperience, but I fear you do not realize how necessary it is to go slow\nin these matters. You ask men who have always opened a faucet from left\nto right to now open one that moves in a vertical plane. Here, I will\nshow you; move your arm so; do you not see that it takes\ndifferent muscles?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course, but what of it? The solution flows faster and the\noperation is easier.\"\n\n\"It is easy for you to say that; for you or me it would make no\ndifference since our muscles have all been developed indiscriminately.\"\n\n\"But what are your labour gymnasiums for, if not to develop all\nmuscles?\"\n\n\"Now do not misunderstand me. I serve as an interpreter between the\nminds of the workers and your mind as Director of the Works. As for the\nmuscles developed in the gymnasium, those were developed for sport and\nnot for labour. But that is not the worst of it; you have designed the\nnew benches so low that the mixers must stoop at their work. It is\nvery painful.\"\n\n\"Good God,\" I cried, \"what became of the stools? The mixers are to sit\ndown--I ordered two thousand stools.\"\n\n\"That I know, Herr Chief, but the equipment expert consulted me about\nthe matter and I countermanded the order. It would never do. I did not\nconsult you, it is true, but that was merely a kindness. I did not wish\nto expose your lack of knowledge, if I may call it such.\"\n\n\"Call it what you please,\" I snapped, for at the time I thought my\nlabour psychologist was a fool, \"but get those stools, immediately.\"\n\n\"But it would never do.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because these men have always stood at their work.\"\n\n\"But why can they not sit down now?\"\n\n\"Because they never have sat down.\"\n\n\"Do they not sit down to eat?\"\n\n\"Yes, but not to work. It is very different. You do not understand the\npsychic immobility of labour. Habits grow stronger as the mentality is\nsimplified. I have heard that there are animals in the zoological garden\nthat still perform useless operations that their remote ancestors\nrequired in their jungle life.\"\n\n\"Then do you infer that these men who must stand at their work inherited\nthe idea from their ancestors?\"\n\n\"That is a matter of eugenics. I do not know, but I do know that we are\npreparing for trouble with these changes. Still I hope to work it out\nwithout serious difficulty, if you do not insist on these transfers.\nWhen workmen have already been forced to change their habitual method of\nwork and then see their fellows being removed to other and still\nstranger work it breeds dangerous unrest.\"\n\n\"One thing is certain,\" I replied; \"we cannot delay the installation of\nthe new method; as fast as the equipment is ready the new operation must\nreplace the old.\"\n\n\"But the effect of that policy will be that there will not be enough\nwork, and besides the work is, as you say, lighter and that will result\nin the cutting down of the food rations.\"\n\n\"But I have already arranged that,\" I said triumphantly; \"the Rationing\nBureau have adjusted the calorie standards so that the men will get as\nmuch food as they have been used to.\"\n\n\"What! you have done that?\" exclaimed the labour psychologist; \"then\nthere will be trouble. That will destroy the balance of the food supply\nand the expenditure of muscular energy and the men will get fat. Then\nthe other men will accuse them of stealing food and we shall have\nbloodshed.\"\n\n\"A moment ago,\" I smiled, \"you told me I did not know your business. Now\nI will tell you that you do not know mine. We ordered special food\nbulked up in volume; the scheme is working nicely; you need not worry\nabout that. As for the other matter, this surplus of men, it seems to me\nthat the only thing is to cut down the working hours temporarily until\nthe transfers can be made.\"\n\nThe psychologist shook his head. \"It is dangerous,\" he said, \"and very\nunusual. I advise instead that you have the operation engineers go over\nthe processes and involve the operations, both to make them more nearly\nresemble the old ones, and to add to the time and energy consumption of\nthe tasks.\"\n\n\"No,\" I said emphatically, \"I invented a more economical process for\nthis industry and I do not propose to see my invention prostituted in\nthis fashion. I appreciate your advice, but if we cannot transfer the\nworkers any faster, then the labour hours must be cut. I will issue the\norder tomorrow. This is my final decision.\"\n\nI was in authority and that settled the matter. The psychologist was\nvery decent about it and helped me fix up a speech and that next night\nthe workers were ordered to assemble in their halls and I made my speech\ninto a transmitting horn. I told them that they had been especially\nhonoured by their Emperor, who, appreciating their valuable service, had\ngranted them a part-time vacation and that until further notice their\nsix-hour shifts were to be cut to four. I further told them that their\nrations would not be reduced and advised them to take enough extra\nexercise in the gymnasium to offset their shorter hours so they would\nnot get fat and be the envy of their fellows.\n\n~3~\n\nFor a time the workers seemed greatly pleased with their shorter hours.\nAnd then, from the Listening-in-Service, came the rumour of the strike.\nThe first report of the strike gave me no clue to the grievance and I\nasked for fuller reports. When these came the next day I was shocked\nbeyond belief. If I had anticipated anything in that interval of terror\nit was that my workers were to strike because their communications had\nbeen shut off or that they were to strike in sympathy for their fellows\nand demand that all hours be shortened like their own. But the grievance\nwas not that. My men were to go on strike for the simple reason that\ntheir hours had been shortened!\n\nThe catastrophe once started came with a rush, for when I reached the\noffice the next day the psychologist was awaiting me and told me that\nthe strike was on. I rushed out immediately and went down to the works.\nThe psychologist followed me. As I entered the great industrial\nlaboratories I saw all the men at their usual places and going through\ntheir usual operations. I turned to my companion who was just coming up,\nand said: \"What do you mean; I thought you told me the strike was on,\nthat the men had already walked out?\"\n\n\"What do you mean by 'walked out'?\" he returned, as puzzled as I.\n\n\"Walked out of the works,\" I explained; \"away from their duties, quit\nwork. Struck!\"\n\n\"But they have struck. Perhaps you have never seen a strike before, but\ndo you not see the strike badges?\"\n\nAnd then I looked and saw that every workman wore a tiny red flag, and\nthe flag bore no imperial eagle.\n\n\"It means,\" I gasped, \"that they have renounced the rule of the Royal\nHouse. This is not a strike, this is rebellion, treason!\"\n\n\"It is the custom,\" said the labour psychologist, \"and as for rebellion\nand treason that you speak of I hardly think you ought to call it that\nfor rebellion and treason are forbidden.\"\n\n\"Then just what does it mean?\"\n\n\"It means that this particular group of workers have temporarily\nwithdrawn their allegiance to the Royal House, and they have, in their\nown minds, restored the old socialist r\u00e9gime, until they can make\npetition to the Emperor and he passes on their grievance. They will do\nthat in their halls tonight. We, of course, will be connected up and\nlisten in.\"\n\n\"Then they are not really on strike?\"\n\n\"Certainly they are on strike. All strikes are conducted so.\"\n\n\"Then why do they not quit work?\"\n\n\"But why should they quit work? They are striking because their hours\nare already too short--pardon, Herr Chief, but I warned you!\n\n\"I think I know what you mean,\" he added after a pause; \"you have\nprobably read some fiction of old times when the workers went on strike\nby quitting work.\"\n\n\"Yes, exactly. I suppose that is where I did get my ideas; and that is\nnow forbidden--by the Emperor?\"\n\n\"Not by the Emperor, for you see these men wear the flags without the\neagle. They at present do not acknowledge his authority.\"\n\n\"Then all this strike is a matter of red badges without eagles and\neverything else will go on as usual?\"\n\n\"By no means. These men are striking against the descending authority\nfrom the Royal House. They not only refuse to wear the eagle until their\ngrievance is adjusted but they will refuse to accept further education,\nfor that is a thing that descends from above. If you will go now to the\npicture halls, where the other shift should be, you will find the halls\nall empty. The men refuse to go to the moving pictures.\"\n\nThat night we \"listened in.\" A bull-throated fellow, whom I learned was\nthe Talking Delegate, addressed the Emperor, and much to my surprise I\nthought I heard the Emperor's own voice in reply, stating that he was\nready to hear their grievance.\n\nThen the bull voice of the Talking Delegate gave the reason for the\nstrike: \"The Director of the Works, speaking for your Majesty, has\ngranted us a part time vacation, and shortened our hours from six to\nfour. We thank you for this honour but we have decided we do not like\nit. We do not know what to do during those extra two hours. We had our\ngames and amusements but we had our regular hours for them. If we play\nlonger we become tired of play. If we sleep longer we cannot sleep as\nwell. Moreover we are losing our appetite and some of us are afraid to\neat all our portions for fear we will become fat. So we have decided\nthat we do not like a four-hour day and we have therefore taken the\neagles off our flags and will refuse to replace them or to go to the\neducational pictures until our hours are restored to the six-hour day\nthat we have always had.\"\n\nAnd now the Emperor's voice replied that he would take the matter under\nconsideration and report his decision in three days and, that meanwhile\nhe knew he could trust them to conduct themselves as good socialists who\nwere on strike, and hence needed no king.\n\nThe next day the psychologist brought a representative of the\nInformation Staff to my office and together we wrote the reply that the\nEmperor was to make. It would be necessary to concede them the full six\nhours and introduce the system of complicating the labour operations to\nmake more work. Much chagrined, I gave in, and called in the motion\nstudy engineers and set them to the task. Meanwhile the Royal Voice was\nsent for and coached in the Emperor's reply to the striking workmen, and\na picture film of the Emperor, timed to fit the length of the speech,\nwas ordered from stock.\n\nThe Royal Voice was an actor by birth who had been trained to imitate\nHis Majesty's speech. This man, who specialized in the Emperor's\nspeeches to the workers, prided himself that he was the best Royal Voice\nin Berlin and I complimented him by telling him that I had been deceived\nby him the evening before. But considering that the workers, never\nhaving heard the Emperor's real voice, would have no standard of\ncomparison, I have never been able to see the necessity of the accuracy\nof his imitation, unless it was on the ground of art for art's sake.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nTHE DIVINE DESCENDANTS OF WILLIAM THE GREAT GIVE A BENEFIT\nFOR THE CANINE GARDENS AND PAY TRIBUTE TO THE PIGGERIES\n\n\n~1~\n\nThe strike that I had feared would be the beginning of a bloody\nrevolution had ended with an actor shouting into a horn and the shadow\nof an Emperor waving his arms. But meanwhile Capt. Grauble, on whom I\nstaked my hopes of escape from Berlin, had departed to the Arctic and\nwould not return for many months. That he would return I firmly\nbelieved; statistically the chances were in his favour as this was his\nfourth trip, and hope was backing the favourable odds of the law of\nchance.\n\nSo I set myself to prepare for that event. My faith was strong that\nGrauble could be won over to the cause of saving the Germans by\nbetraying Germany. I did not even consider searching for another man,\nfor Grauble was that one rare man in thousands who is rebellious and\nfearless by nature, a type of which the world makes heroes when their\ncause wins and traitors when it fails--a type that Germany had all but\neliminated from the breed of men.\n\nBut, if I were to escape to the outer world through Grauble's\nconnivance, there was still the problem of getting permission to board\nthe submarine, ostensibly to go to the Arctic mines. Even in my exalted\nposition as head of the protium works I could not learn where the\nsubmarine docks or the passage to them was located. But I did learn\nenough to know that the way was impenetrable without authoritative\npermission, and that thoughts of escape as a stowaway were not worth\nconsidering. I also learned that Admiral von Kufner had sole authority\nto grant permission to make the Arctic trip.\n\nThe Admiral had promptly turned down my first proposal to go to the\nArctic ore fields, and had by his pompous manner rebuffed the attempts I\nmade to cultivate his friendship through official interviews. I\ntherefore decided to call on Marguerite and the Countess Luise to see\nwhat chance there was to get a closer approach to the man through social\navenues. The Countess was very obliging in the matter, but she warned me\nwith lifted finger that the Admiral was a gay bachelor and a worshipper\nof feminine charms, and that I might rue the day I suggested his being\ninvited into the admiring circle that revolved about Marguerite. But I\nlaughingly disclaimed any fears on that score and von Kufner was bidden\nto the next ball given by the Countess.\n\nMarguerite was particularly gracious to the Admiral and speedily led him\ninto the inner circle that gathered informally in the salon of the\nCountess Luise. I made it a point to absent myself on some of these\noccasions, for I did not want the Admiral to guess the purpose that lay\nbehind this ensnaring of him into our group.\n\nAnd yet I saw much of Marguerite, for I spent most of my leisure in the\nsociety of the Royal Level, where thought, if shallow, was comparatively\nfree. I took particular pleasure in watching the growth of Marguerite's\nmind, as the purely intellectual conceptions she had acquired from Dr.\nZimmern and his collection of books adjusted itself to the absurd\nrealities of the celestial society of the descendants of William\nthe Great.\n\nIt may be that charity is instinctive in the heart of a good woman, or\nperhaps it was because she had read the Christian Bible; but whatever\nthe origin of the impulse, Marguerite was charitably inclined and wished\nto make personal sacrifice for the benefit of other beings less well\nsituated than herself. While she was still a resident of the Free Level\nshe had talked to me of this feeling and of her desire to help others.\nBut the giving of money or valuables by one woman to another was\nstrictly forbidden, and Marguerite had not at the time possessed more\nthan she needed for her own subsistence. But now that she was relatively\nwell off, this charitable feeling struggled to find expression. Hence\nwhen she had learned of the Royal Charity Society she had straightway\nbegged the Countess to present her name for membership, without stopping\nto examine into the detail of the Society's activities.\n\nThe Society was at that time preparing to hold a bazaar and sent out\ncalls for contributions of cast off clothing and ornaments. Marguerite\nas yet possessed no clothes or jewelry of Royal quality except the\nminimum which the demands of her position made necessary; and so she\ntimidly asked the Countess if her clothing which she had worn on the\nFree Level would suffice as gifts of charity. The Countess had assured\nher that it would do nicely as the destination of all the clothing\ncontributed was for the women of the Free Level. Thinking that an\nopportunity had at last arisen for her to express her compassion for the\nill-favoured girls of her own former level, Marguerite hastened to\nbundle up such presentable gowns as she had and sent them to the bazaar\nby her maid.\n\nLater she had attended the meeting of the society when the net results\nof the collections were announced. To her dismay she found that the\nclothing contributed had been sold for the best price it would bring to\nthe women of the Free Level and that the purpose of the sacrifices, of\nthat which was useless to the possessors but valuable to others, was the\ndefraying of the expense of extending the romping grounds for the dogs\nof the charitably maintained canine garden.\n\nMarguerite was vigorously debating the philosophy of charity with the\nyoung Count Rudolph that evening when I called. She was maintaining that\nhuman beings and not animals should be the recipients of charity and the\nyoung Count was expounding to her the doctrine of the evil effects of\ncharity upon the recipient.\n\n\"Moreover,\" explained Count Rudolph, \"there are no humans in Berlin that\nneed charity, since every class of our efficiently organized State\nreceives exactly what it should receive and hence is in need of nothing.\nCharity is permissible only when poverty exists.\"\n\n\"But there is poverty on the Free Level,\" maintained Marguerite; \"many\nof the ill-favoured girls suffer from hunger and want better clothes\nthan they can buy.\"\n\n\"That may be,\" said the Count, \"but to permit them gifts of charity\nwould be destructive of their pride; moreover, there are few women on\nthe Royal Level who would give for such a purpose.\"\n\n\"But surely,\" said Marguerite, \"there must be somewhere in the city,\nother women or children or even men to whom the proceeds of these gifts\nwould mean more than it does to dogs.\"\n\n\"If any group needed anything the state would provide it,\" repeated the\nCount.\n\n\"Then why,\" protested Marguerite, \"cannot the state provide also for the\ndogs, or if food and space be lacking why are these dogs allowed to\nbreed and multiply?\"\n\n\"Because it would be cruel to suppress their instincts.\"\n\nMarguerite was puzzled by this answer, but with my more rational mind I\nsaw a flaw in the logic of this statement. \"But that is absurd,\" I said,\n\"for if their number were not checked in some fashion, in a few decades\nthe dogs would overswarm the city.\"\n\nIt was now the Count's turn to look puzzled. \"You have inferred an\nembarrassing question,\" he stated, \"one, in fact, that ought not to be\nanswered in the presence of a lady, but since the Princess Marguerite\ndoes not seem to be a lover of dogs, I will risk the explanation. The\nMedical Level requires dogs for purposes of scientific research. Since\nthe women are rarely good mathematicians, it is easily possible in this\nmanner to keep down the population of the Canine Garden.\"\n\n\"But the dogs required for research,\" I suggested, \"could easily be bred\nin kennels maintained for that purpose.\"\n\n\"So they could,\" said the Count, \"but the present plan serves a double\npurpose. It provides the doctors with scalpel practise and it also\namuses the women of the Royal House who are very much in need of\namusement since we men are all so dull.\"\n\n\"Woman's love,\" continued Rudolph, waxing eloquent, \"should have full\nfreedom for unfoldment. If it be forcibly confined to her husband and\nchildren it might burst its bounds and express too great an interest in\nother humans. The dogs act as a sort of safety valve for this instinct\nof charity.\"\n\nThe facetious young Count saw from Marguerite's horror-stricken face\nthat he was making a marked impression and he recklessly continued: \"The\nkeepers at the Canine Gardens understand this perfectly. When funds\nbegin to run low they put the dogs in the outside pens on short rations,\nand the brutes do their own begging; then we have another bazaar and\neverybody is happy. It is a good system and I would advise you not to\ncriticize it since the institution is classic. Other schemes have been\ntried; at one time women were permitted to knit socks for soldiers--we\nalways put that in historical pictures--but the socks had to be melted\nup again as felted fibre is much more durable; and then, after the women\nwere forbidden to see the soldiers, they lost interest. But the dog\ncharity is a proven institution and we should never try to change\nanything that women do not want changed since they are the conservative\nbulwark of society and our best protection against the danger of\nthe untried.\"\n\n~2~\n\nBlocked in her effort to relieve human poverty by the discovery that its\nexistence was not recognized, Marguerite's next adventure in doing good\nin the world was to take up the battle against ignorance by contributing\nto the School for the Education of Servants.\n\nThe Servant problem in Berlin, and particularly on the Royal Level, had\nbeen solved so far as male servants were concerned, for these were a\nwell recognized strain eugenically bred as a division of the\nintellectual caste. I had once taken Dr. Zimmern to task on this\nclassification of the servant as an intellectual.\n\n\"The servant is not intellectual creatively,\" the Eugenist replied, \"yet\nit would never do to class him as Labour since he produces nothing.\nMoreover, the servant's mind reveals the most specialized development of\nthe most highly prized of all German intellectual characteristics\n--obedience.\n\n\"It might interest you to know,\" continued Zimmern, \"that we use this\nservant strain in outcrossing with other strains when they show a\ntendency to decline in the virtue of obedience. If I had not chosen to\nexempt you from paternity when your rebellious instincts were reported\nto me, and the matter had been turned over to our Remating Board they\nmight have reassigned you to mothers of the servant class. This practice\nof out-crossing, though rare, is occasionally essential in all\nscientific breeding.\"\n\n\"Then do you mean,\" I asked in amazement, \"that the highest intellectual\nstrains have servant blood in them?\"\n\n\"Certainly. And why not, since obedience is the crowning glory of the\nGerman mind? Even Royal blood has a dash of the servant strain.\"\n\n\"You mean, I suppose, from illegitimate children?\"\n\n\"Not at all; that sort of illegitimacy is not recognized. I mean from\nthe admission of servants into Royal Society, just as you have been\nadmitted.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\"\n\n\"And why impossible, since obedience is our supreme racial virtue? Go\nconsult your social register. The present Emperor, I believe, has\nadmitted none, but his father admitted several and gave them princely\nincomes. They married well and their children are respected, though I\nunderstand they are not very much invited out for the reason that they\nare poor conversationalists. They only speak when spoken to and then\nanswer, 'Ja, Mein Herr.' I hear they are very miserable; since no one\ncommands them they must be very bored with life, as they are unable to\nthink of anything to do to amuse themselves. In time the trait will be\nmodified, of course, since the Royal blood will soon predominate, and\nthe strongest inherent trait of Royalty is to seek amusement.\"\n\nThis specialized class of men servants needed little education, for, as\nI took more interest in observing after this talk with Zimmern, they\nwere the most perfectly fitted to their function of any class in Berlin.\nBut there was also a much more numerous class of women servants on the\nRoyal Level. These, as a matter of economy, were not specially bred to\nthe office, but were selected from the mothers who had been rejected for\nfurther maternity after the birth of one or two children. Be it said to\nthe credit of the Germans that no women who had once borne a child was\never permitted to take up the profession of Delilah--a statement which\nunfortunately cannot be made of the rest of the world. These mothers\ntogether with those who had passed the child bearing age more than\nsupplied the need for nurses on the maternity levels and teachers in\ngirls' schools.\n\nAs a result they swarmed the Royal Level in all capacities of service\nfor which women are fitted. Originally educated for maternity they had\nto be re-educated for service. Not satisfied with the official education\nprovided by the masculine-ordered state, the women of the Royal Level\nmaintained a continuation school in the fine art of obedience and the\nkindred virtues of the perfect servant.\n\nSo again it was that Marguerite became involved in a movement that in no\nwise expressed the needs of her spirit, and from which she\nspeedily withdrew.\n\nThe next time she came to me for advice. \"I want to do something,\" she\ncried. \"I want to be of some use in the world. You saved me from that\nawful life--for you know what it would have been for me if Dr. Zimmern\nhad died or his disloyalty had been discovered--and you have brought me\nhere where I have riches and position but am useless. I tried to be\ncharitable, to relieve poverty, but they say there is no poverty to be\nrelieved. I tried to relieve ignorance, but they will not allow that\neither. What else is there that needs to be relieved? Is there no good\nI can do?\"\n\n\"Your problem is not a new one,\" I replied, thinking of the world-old\nexperience of the good women yoked to idleness by wealth and position.\n\"You have tried to relieve poverty and ignorance and find your efforts\nfutile. There is one thing more I believe that is considered a classic\nremedy for your trouble. You can devote yourself to the elimination of\nugliness, to the increase of beauty. Is there no organization devoted to\nthat work?\"\n\n\"There is,\" returned Marguerite, \"and I was about to join it, but I\nthought this time I had better ask advice. There is the League to\nBeautify Berlin.\"\n\n\"Then by all means join,\" I advised. \"It is the safest of all such\nefforts, for though poverty may not exist and ignorance may not be\nrelieved, yet surely Berlin can be more beautiful. But of course your\nefforts must be confined to the Royal Level as you do not see the rest\nof the city.\"\n\nSo Marguerite joined the League to Beautify Berlin and I became an\nauxiliary member much appreciated because of my liberal contributions.\nIt proved an excellent source of amusement. The League met weekly and\ndiscussed the impersonal aspects of the beauty of the level in open\nmeetings, while a secret complaint box was maintained into which all\nwere invited to deposit criticisms of more personal matters. It was\nforbidden even in this manner to criticize irremedial ugliness such as\nthe matter of one's personal form or features, but dress and manners\ncame within the permitted range and the complaints were regularly mailed\nto the offenders. This surprised me a little as I would have thought\nthat such a practice would have made the League unpopular, but on the\ncontrary, it was considered the mainstay of the organization, for the\nrecipient of the complaint, if a non-member, very often joined the\nLeague immediately, hoping thereby to gain sweet revenge.\n\nBut aside from this safety valve for the desire to make personal\ncriticism, the League was a very creditable institution and it was there\nthat we met the great critics to whose untiring efforts the rare\ndevelopment of German art was due.\n\nCut off from the opportunity to appropriate by purchase or capture the\nworks of other peoples, German art had suffered a severe decline in the\nfirst few generations of the isolation, but in time they had developed\nan art of their own. A great abundance of cast statues of white crystal\nadorned the plazas and gardens and, being unexposed to dust or rain,\nthey preserved their pristine freshness so that it appeared they had all\nbeen made the day before. Mural paintings also flourished abundantly and\nin some sections the endless facade of the apartments was a\ncontinuous pageant.\n\nBut it was in landscape gardening that German art had made its most\nwonderful advancement. Having small opportunity for true architecture\nbecause of the narrow engineering limitations of the city's\nconstruction, talent for architecture had been turned to landscape\ngardening. I use the term advisedly for the very absence of natural\nlandscape within a roofed-in city had resulted in greater development of\nthe artificial product.\n\nThe earlier efforts, few of which remained unaltered, were more inclined\ntoward imitation of Nature as it exists in the world of sun and rocks\nand rain. But, as the original models were forgotten and new generations\nof gardeners arose, new sorts of nature were created. Artificial rocks,\nartificial soil, artificially bred and cultured plants, were combined in\nnew designs, unrealistic it is true, but still a very wonderful\ndevelopment of what might be called synthetic or romantic nature. The\nwater alone was real and even in some cases that was altered as in the\nbeautifully dyed rivulets and in the truly remarkable \"Fountain of\nBlood,\" dedicated to one of the sons of William the Great--I have\nforgotten his name--in honour of his attack upon Verdun in the First\nWorld War.\n\nIn these wondrous gardens, with the Princess Marguerite strolling by my\nside, I spent the happiest hours of my sojourn in Berlin. But my joy was\ntangled with a thread of sadness for the more I gazed upon this\nsynthetic nature of German creation the more I hungered to tell her of,\nand to take her to see, the real Nature of the outside world--upon\nwhich, in my opinion, with all due respect to their achievements, the\nGermans had not been able to improve.\n\n~3~\n\nWhile the women of the Royal House were not permitted of their own\nvolition to stray from the Royal Level, excursions were occasionally\narranged, with proper permits and guards. These were social events of\nconsequence and the invitations were highly prized. Noteworthy among\nthem was an excursion to the highest levels of the city and to the\nroof itself.\n\nThe affair was planned by Admiral von Kufner in Marguerite's honour;\nfor, having spent her childhood elsewhere, she had never experienced the\nwonder of this roof excursion so highly prized by Royalty, and for ever\nforbidden to all other women and to all but a few men of the teeming\nmillions who swarmed like larvae in this vast concrete cheese.\n\nThe formal invitations set no hour for the excursion as it was\nunderstood that the exact time depended upon weather conditions of which\nwe would later be notified. When this notice came the hour set was in\nthe conventional evening of the Royal Level, but corresponding to about\nthree A.M. by solar time. The party gathered at the suite of the\nCountess Luise and numbered some forty people, for whom a half dozen\nguides were provided in the form of officers of the Roof Guard. The\njourney to our romantic destination took us up some hundred metres in an\nelevator, a trip which required but two minutes, but would lead to a\nworld as different as Mount Olympus from Erebus.\n\nBut we did not go directly to the roof, for the hour preferred for that\nvisit had not yet arrived and our first stop was at the swine levels,\nwhich had so aroused my curiosity and strained belief when I had first\ndiscovered their existence from the chart of my atlas.\n\nAs the door of the elevator shaft slid open, a vast squealing and\ngrunting assaulted our ears. The hours of the swine, like those of their\nmasters, were not reckoned by either solar or sidereal time, but had\nbeen altered, as experiment had demonstrated, to a more efficient cycle.\nThe time of our trip was chosen so that we might have this earthly music\nof the feeding time as a fitting prelude to the visioning of the\nsilent heavens.\n\nOn the visitors' gangway we walked just above the reach of the jostling\nbristly backs, and our own heads all but grazed the low ceiling of the\nlevel. To economize power the lights were dim. Despite the masterful\nachievement of German cleanliness and sanitation there was a permeating\nodour, a mingling of natural and synthetic smells, which added to the\ngloom of semi-darkness and the pandemonium of swinish sound produced a\ntotality of infernal effect that thwarts description.\n\nBut relief was on the way for the automatic feed conveyors were rapidly\nmoving across our section. First we heard a diminution of sound from one\ndirection, then a hasty scuffling and a happy grunting beneath us and,\nas the conveyors moved swiftly on, the squealing receded into the\ndistance like the dying roar of a retreating storm.\n\nThe Chief Swineherd, immaculately dressed and wearing his full quota of\ndecorations and medals, honoured us with his personal presence. With the\nexcusable pride that every worthy man takes in his work, he expounded\nthe scientific achievements and economic efficiency of the swinish world\nover which he reigned. The men of the party listened with respect to his\nexplanations of the accomplishments of sanitation and of the economy of\nthe cycle of chemical transformation by which these swine were\nmaintained without decreasing the capacity of the city for human\nsupport. Lastly the Swineherd spoke of the protection that the swine\nlevels provided against the effects of an occasional penetrating bomb\nthat chanced to fall in the crater of its predecessor before the damage\ncould be repaired.\n\nPursuant to this fact the uppermost swine level housed those unfortunate\nanimals that were nearest the sausage stage. On the next lower level, to\nwhich we now descended by a spiral stair through a ventilating opening,\nwere brutes of less advanced ages. On the lowest of the three levels\nwhere special lights were available for our benefit even the women\nceased to shudder and gave expression to ecstatic cries of rapture, as\nall the world has ever done when seeing baby beasts pawing contentedly\nat maternal founts.\n\n\"Is it not all wonderful?\" effused Admiral von Kufner, with a sweeping\ngesture; \"so efficient, so sanitary, so automatic, such a fine example\nof obedience to system and order. This is what I call real science and\nbeauty; one might almost say Germanic beauty.\"\n\n\"But I do not like it,\" replied Marguerite with her usual candour. \"I\nwish they would abolish these horrid levels.\"\n\n\"But surely,\" said the Countess, \"you would not wish to condemn us to a\ndiet of total mineralism?\"\n\n\"But the Herr Chemist here could surely invent for us a synthetic\nsausage,\" remarked Count Rudolph. \"I have eaten vegetarian kraut made of\nreal cabbage from the Botanical Garden, but it was inferior to the\nsynthetic article.\"\n\n\"Do not make light, young people,\" spoke up the most venerable member of\nour party, the eminent Herr Dr. von Brausmorganwetter, the historian\nlaureate of the House of Hohenzollern. \"It is not as a producer of\nsausages alone that we Germans are indebted to this worthy animal. I am\nnow engaged in writing a book upon the influence of the swine upon\nGerman Kultur. In the first part I shall treat of the Semitic question.\nThe Jews were very troublesome among us in the days before the\nisolation. They were a conceited race. As capitalists, they amassed\nfortunes; as socialists they stirred up rebellion; they objected to war;\nthey would never have submitted to eugenics; they even insisted that we\nGermans had stolen their God!\n\n\"We tried many schemes to be rid of these troublesome people, and all\nfailed. Therefore I say that Germany owes a great debt to the noble\nanimal who rid us of the disturbing presence of the Jews, for when pork\nwas made compulsory in the diet they fled the country of their\nown accord.\n\n\"In the second part of my book I shall tell the story of the founding of\nthe New Berlin, for our noble city was modelled on the fortified\npiggeries of the private estates of William III. In those days of the\nopen war the enemy bombed the stock farms. Synthetic foods were as yet\nimperfectly developed. Protein was at a premium; the emperor did not\nlike fish, so he built a vast concrete structure with a roof heavily\narmoured with sand that he might preserve his swine from the murderous\nattacks of the enemy planes.\n\n\"It was during the retreat from Peking. The German armies were being\ncrowded back on every side. The Ray had been invented, but William the\nIII knew that it could not be used to protect so vast a domain and that\nGermany would be penned into narrow borders and be in danger of\nextermination by a\u00ebrial bombardment. In those days he went for rest and\nconsolation to his estates, for he took great pleasure in his\nthoroughbred swine. Some traitorous spy reported his move to the enemy\nand a bombing squadron attacked the estates. The Emperor took refuge in\nhis fortified piggery. And so the great vision came to him.\n\n\"I have read the exact words of this thoughts as recorded in his diary\nwhich is preserved in the archives of the Royal Palace: 'As are these\nhappy brutes, so shall my people be. In safety from the terrors of the\nsky--protected from the vicissitudes of nature and the enmity of men, so\nshall I preserve them.'\n\n\"That was the conception of the armoured city of Berlin. But that was\nnot all. For the bombardment kept up for days and the Emperor could not\nescape. On the fourth day came the second idea--two new ideas in less\nthan a week! William III was a great thinker.\n\n\"Thus he recorded the second inspiration: 'And even as I have bred these\nswine, some for bacon and some for lard, so shall the German Blond\nBrutes be bred the super-men, some specialized for labour and some\nfor brains.'\n\n\"These two ideas are the foundation of the kultur of our Imperial\nSocialism, the one idea to preserve us and the other to re-create us as\nthe super-race. And both of these ideas we owe to this noble animal. The\nswine should be emblazoned with the eagle upon our flag.\"\n\nAs the Historian finished his eulogy, I glanced surreptitiously at the\nfaces of his listeners, and caught a twinkle in Marguerite's eyes; but\nthe faces of the others were as serious as graven images.\n\nFinally the Countess spoke: \"Do I understand, then, that you consider\nthe swine the model of the German race?\"\n\n\"Only of the lower classes,\" said the aged historian, \"but not the House\nof Hohenzollern. We are exalted above the necessities of breeding, for\nwe are divine.\"\n\nEyes were now turned upon me, for I was the only one of the company not\nof Hohenzollern blood. Unrelieved by laughter the situation was painful.\n\n\"But,\" said Count Rudolph, coming to my rescue, \"we also seek safety in\nthe fortified piggeries.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said the Historian; \"so did our noble ancestor.\"\n\n~4~\n\nFrom the piggeries, we went to the green level where, growing beneath\neye-paining lights, was a matted mass of solid vegetation from which\ncame those rare sprigs of green which garnished our synthetic dishes.\nBut this was too monotonous to be interesting and we soon went above to\nthe Defence Level where were housed vast military and rebuilding\nmechanisms and stores. After our guides had shown us briefly about among\nthese paraphernalia, we were conducted to one of the sloping ramps which\nled through a heavily arched tunnel to the roof above.\n\nMarguerite clung close to my arm, quivering with expectancy and\nexcitement, as we climbed up the sloping passage-way and felt on our\nfaces the breath of the crisp air of the May night.\n\nThe sky came into vision with startling suddenness as we walked out upon\nthe soft sand blanket of the roof. The night was absolutely clear and my\nfirst impression was that every star of the heavens had miraculously\nwaxed in brilliancy. The moon, in the last quarter, hung midway between\nthe zenith and the western horizon. The milky way seemed a floating band\nof whitish flame. About us, in the form of a wide crescent, for we were\nnear the eastern edge of the city, swung the encircling band of\nsearchlights, but the air was so clear that this stockade of artificial\nlight beams was too pale to dim the points of light in the\nblue-black vault.\n\nIn anticipating this visit to the roof I had supposed it would seem\ncommonplace to me, and had discussed it very little with Marguerite,\nlest I might reveal an undue lack of wonder. But now as I thrilled once\nmore beneath their holy light, the miracle of unnumbered far-flung\nflaming suns stifled again the vanity of human conceit and I stood with\nsoul unbared and worshipful beneath the vista of incommensurate space\nwherein the birth and death of worlds marks the unending roll of time.\nAnd at my side a silent gazing woman stood, contrite and humble and the\nthrill and quiver of her body filled me with a joy of wordless delight.\n\nA blundering guide began lecturing on astronomy and pointing out with\npompous gestures the constellations and planets. But Marguerite led me\nbeyond the sound of his voice. \"It is not the time for listening to\ntalk,\" she said. \"I only want to see.\"\n\nWhen the astronomer had finished his speech-making, our party moved\nslowly toward the East, where we could just discern the first faint\nlight of the coming dawn. When we reached the parapet of the eastern\nedge of the city's roof, the stars had faded and pale pink streaked the\neastern sky. The guides brought folding chairs from a nearby tunnel way\nand most of the party sat down on a hillock of sand, very much as men\nmight seat themselves in the grandstand of a race course. But I was so\ninterested in what the dawn would reveal beneath the changing colours of\nthe sky, that I led Marguerite to the rail of the parapet where we could\nlook down into the yawning depths upon the surface of German soil.\n\nMy first vision over the parapet revealed but a mottled grey. But as the\nlight brightened the grey land took form, and I discerned a few scraggly\npatches of green between the torn masses of distorted soil.\n\nThe stars had faded now and only the pale moon remained in the bluing\nsky, while below the land disclosed a sad monotony of ruin and waste,\nutterly devoid of any constructive work of man.\n\nMarguerite, her gaze fixed on the dawn, was beginning to complain of the\nlight paining her eyes, when one of the guides hurried by with an open\nsatchel swung from his shoulders. \"Here are your glasses,\" he said; \"put\nthem on at once. You must be very careful now, or you will injure\nyour eyes.\"\n\nWe accepted the darkened protecting lenses, but I found I did not need\nmine until the sun itself had appeared above the horizon.\n\n\"Did you see it so in your vision?\" questioned Marguerite, as the first\nbeams glistened on the surface of the sanded roof.\n\n\"This,\" I replied, \"is a very ordinary sunrise with a perfectly\ncloudless sky. Some day, perhaps, when the gates of this prison of\nBerlin are opened, we will be able to see all the sunrises of my\nvisions, and even more wonderful ones.\"\n\n\"Karl,\" she whispered, \"how do you know of all these things? Sometimes I\nbelieve you are something more than human, that you of a truth possess\nthe blood of divinity which the House of Hohenzollern claims.\"\n\n\"No,\" I answered; \"not divinity,--just a little larger humanity, and\nsome day very soon I am going to tell you more of the source of\nmy visions.\"\n\nShe looked at me through her darkened glasses. \"I only know,\" she said,\n\"that you are wonderful, and very different from other men.\"\n\nHad we been alone on the roof of Berlin, I could not have resisted the\ntemptation to tell her then that stars and sun were familiar friends to\nme and that the devastated soil that stretched beneath us was but the\nwasted skeleton of a fairer earth I knew and loved. But we were\nsurrounded by a host of babbling sightseers and so the moment passed and\nI remained to Marguerite a man of mystery and a seer of visions.\n\nThe sun fully risen now, we were led to a protruding observation\nplatform that permitted us to view the wall of the city below. It was\nmerely one vast grey wall without interruption or opening in the\nmonotonous surface.\n\nAmid the more troubled chaos of the ground immediately below we could\nsee fragments of concrete blown from the parapet of the roof. The wall\nbeneath us, we were told, was only of sufficient thickness to withstand\nfire of the aircraft guns. The havoc that might be wrought, should the\ndefence mines ever be forced back and permit the walls of Berlin to come\nwithin range of larger field pieces, was easily imagined. But so long as\nthe Ray defence held, the massive fort of Berlin was quite impervious to\nattacks of the world forces of land and air and the stalemate of war\nmight continue for other centuries.\n\nWith the coming of daylight we had heard the rumbling of trucks as the\nroof repairing force emerged to their task. Now that our party had\nbecome tired of gazing through their goggles at the sun, our guides led\nus in the direction where this work was in progress. On the way we\npassed a single unfilled crater, a deep pit in the flinty quartz sand\nthat spread a protecting blanket over the solid structure of the roof.\nThese craters in the sand proved quite harmless except for the labour\ninvolved in their refilling. Further on we came to another, now\nhalf-filled from a spouting pipe with ground quartz blown from some\nremote subterranean mine, so to keep up the wastage from wind\nand bombing.\n\nAgain we approached the edge of the city and this time found more of\ninterest, for here an addition to the city was under construction. It\nwas but a single prism, not a hundred metres across, which when\ncompleted would add but another block to the city's area. Already the\nouter pillars reached the full height and supported the temporary roof\nthat offered at least a partial protection to the work in progress\nbeneath. Though I watched but a few minutes I was awed with the evident\nrapidity of the building. Dimly I could see the forms below being swung\ninto place with a clock-like regularity and from numerous spouts great\nstreams of concrete poured like flowing lava.\n\nIt is at these building sections that the bombs were aimed and here\nalone that any effectual damage could be done, but the target was a\nsmall one for a plane flying above the reach of the German guns. The\nofficer who guided our group explained this to us: these bombing raids\nwere conducted only at times of particular cloud formations, when the\nveil of mist hung thick and low in an even stratum above which the air\nwas clear. When such formation threatened, the roof of Berlin was\ncleared and the expected bombs fell and spent their fury blowing up the\nsand. It had been a futile warfare, for the means of defence were equal\nto the means of offence.\n\nOur visit to the roof of Berlin was cut short as the sun rose higher,\nbecause the women, though they had donned gloves and veils, were fearful\nof sunburn. So we were led back to the covered ramp into the endless\nnight of the city.\n\n\"Have we seen it all?\" sighed Marguerite, as she removed her veil and\nglasses and gazed back blinkingly into the last light of day.\n\n\"Hardly,\" I said; \"we have not seen a cloud, nor a drop of rain nor a\nflake of snow, nor a flash of lightning, nor heard a peal of thunder.\"\n\nAgain she looked at me with worshipful adoration. \"I forget,\" she\nwhispered; \"and can you vision those things also?\"\n\nBut I only smiled and did not answer, for I saw Admiral von Kufner\nglaring at me. I had monopolized Marguerite's company for the entire\noccasion, and I was well aware that his only reason for arranging this,\nto him a meaningless excursion, had been in the hopes of being with her.\n\n~5~\n\nBut Admiral von Kufner, contending fairly for that share of Marguerite's\ntime which she deigned to grant him, seemed to bear me no malice; and,\nas the months slipped by, I was gratified to find him becoming more\ncordial toward me. We frequently met at the informal gatherings in the\nsalon of the Countess Luise. More rarely Dr. Zimmern came there also,\nfor by virtue of his office he was permitted the social rights of the\nRoyal Level. I surmised, however, that this privilege, in his case, had\nnot included the right to marry on the level, for though the head of the\nEugenic Staff, he had, so far as I could learn, neither wife\nnor children.\n\nBut Dr. Zimmern did not seem to relish royal society, for when he\nchanced to be caught with me among the members of the Royal House the\nflow of his brilliant conversations was checked like a spring in a\ndrought, and he usually took his departure as soon as it was seemly.\n\nOn one of these occasions Admiral von Kufner came in as Zimmern sat\nchatting over cups and incense with Marguerite and me, and the Countess\nand her son. The doctor dropped quietly out of the conversation, and for\na time the youthful Count Ulrich entertained us with a technical\nelaboration of the importance of the love passion as the dominant appeal\nof the picture. Then the Countess broke in with a spirited exposition of\nthe relation of soul harmony to ardent passion.\n\nAdmiral von Kufner listened with ill-disguised impatience. \"But all this\nerotic passion,\" he interrupted, \"will soon again be swept away by the\nrevival of the greater race passion for world rule.\"\n\n\"My dear Admiral,\" said the Countess Luise, \"your ideas of race passion\nare quite proper for the classes who must be denied the free play of the\nlove element in their psychic life, but your notion of introducing these\nideas into the life of the Royal Level is wholly antiquated.\"\n\n\"It is you who are antiquated,\" returned the Admiral, \"for now the day\nis at hand when we shall again taste of danger. His Majesty has--\"\n\n\"Of course His Majesty has told us that the day is at hand,\" interrupted\nthe Countess. \"Has not His Majesty always preserved this allegorical\nfable? It is part of the formal kultur.\"\n\n\"But His Majesty now speaks the truth,\" replied the Admiral gravely,\n\"and I say to you who are so absorbed with the light passions of art and\nlove that we shall not only taste of danger but will fight again in the\nsea and air and on the ground in the outer world. We shall conquer and\nrule the world.\"\n\n\"And do you think, Admiral,\" inquired Marguerite, \"that the German\npeople will then be free in the outer world?\"\n\n\"They will be free to rule the outer world,\" replied the Admiral.\n\n\"But I mean,\" said Marguerite calmly, \"to ask if they will be free again\nto love and marry and rear their own children.\"\n\nAt this na\u00efve question the others exchanged significant glances.\n\n\"My dear child,\" said the Countess, blushing with embarrassment, \"your\ndefective training makes it extremely difficult for you to understand\nthese things.\"\n\n\"Of course it is all forbidden,\" spoke up the young Count, \"but now, if\nit were not, the Princess Marguerite's unique idea would certainly make\ncapital picture material.\"\n\n\"How clever!\" cried the Countess, beaming on her intellectual son.\n\"Nothing is forbidden for plot material for the Royal Level. You shall\nmake a picture showing those great beasts of labour again liberated for\nunrestricted love.\"\n\n\"There is one difficulty,\" Count Rudolph considered. \"How could we get\nactors for the parts? Our thoroughbred actors are all too light of bone,\ntoo delicate of motion, and our actresses bred for dainty beauty would\nhardly caste well for those great hulking round-faced labour mothers.\"\n\n\"Then,\" remarked the Admiral, \"if you must make picture plays why not\none of the mating of German soldiers with the women of the\ninferior races?\"\n\n\"Wonderful!\" exclaimed the plot maker; \"and practical also. Our\nactresses are the exact counterpart of those passionate French beauties.\nI often study their portraits in the old galleries. They have had no\nEugenics, hence they would be unchanged. Is it not so, Doctor?\"\n\n\"Without Eugenics, a race changes with exceeding slowness,\" answered\nZimmern in a voice devoid of expression. \"I should say that the French\nwomen of today would much resemble their ancestral types.\"\n\n\"But picturing such matings of military necessity would be very\ndisgusting,\" reprimanded the Countess.\n\n\"It will be a very necessary part of the coming day of German dominion,\"\nstated the Admiral. \"How else can we expect to rule the world? It is,\nindeed, part of the ordained plan.\"\n\n\"But how,\" I questioned, \"is such a plan to be executed? Would the men\nof the World State tolerate it?\"\n\n\"We will oblige them to tolerate it; the children of the next generation\nof the inferior races must be born of German sires.\"\n\n\"But the Germans are outnumbered ten to one,\" I replied.\n\n\"Polygamy will take care of that, among the white races; the coloured\nraces must be eliminated. All breeding of the coloured races must cease.\nThat, also, is part of the ordained plan.\"\n\nThe conversation was getting on rather dangerous ground for me as I\nrealized that I dare not show too great surprise at this talk, which of\nall things I had heard in Germany was the most preposterous.\n\nBut Marguerite made no effort to disguise her astonishment. \"I thought,\"\nshe said, \"that the German rule of the world was only a plan for\nmilitary victory and the conquering of the World Government. I supposed\nthe people would be left free to live their personal lives as\nthey desired.\"\n\n\"That was the old idea,\" replied the Admiral, \"in the days of open war,\nbefore the possibilities of eugenic science were fully realized. But the\nordained plan revealed to His Majesty requires not only the military and\npolitical rule by the Germans, but the biologic conquest of the inferior\nraces by German blood.\"\n\n\"I think our German system of scientific breeding is very brutal,\" spoke\nup Marguerite with an intensity of feeling quite out of keeping with the\ncalloused manner in which the older members of the Royal House discussed\nthe subject.\n\nThe Admiral turned to her with a gracious air. \"My lovely maiden,\" he\nsaid, \"your youth quite excuses your idealistic sentiments. You need\nonly to remember that you are a daughter of the House of Hohenzollern.\nThe women of this House are privileged always to cultivate and cherish\nthe beautiful sentiments of romantic love and individual maternity. The\nprotected seclusion of the Royal Level exists that such love may bloom\nuntarnished by the grosser affairs of world necessity. It was so\nordained.\"\n\n\"It was so ordained by men,\" replied Marguerite defiantly, \"and what are\nthese privileges while the German women are prostituted on the Free\nLevel or forced to bear children only to lose them--and while you plan\nto enforce other women of the world into polygamous union with a\nconquering race?\"\n\n\"My dear child,\" said the Countess, \"you must not speak in this wild\nfashion. We women of the Royal House must fully realize our\nprivileges--and as for the Admiral's wonderful tale of world\nconquest--that is only his latest hobby. It is talked, of course, in\nmilitary circles, but the defensive war is so dull, you know, especially\nfor the Royal officers, that they must have something to occupy\ntheir minds.\"\n\n\"When the day arrives,\" snapped the Admiral, \"you will find the Royal\nofficers leading the Germans to victory like Atilla and William the\nGreat himself.\"\n\n\"Then why,\" twitted the Countess, \"do you not board one of your\nsubmarines and go forth to battle in the sea?\"\n\n\"I am not courting unnecessary danger,\" retorted the Admiral; \"but I am\nnot dead to the realities of war. My apartments are directly connected\nwith the roof.\"\n\n\"So you can hear the bomb explosions,\" suggested the Countess.\n\n\"And why not?\" snapped the Admiral; \"we must prepare for danger.\"\n\n\"But you have not been bred for danger,\" scoffed the Countess. \"Perhaps\nyou would do well to have your reactions to fear tested out in the\npsychic laboratories; if you should pass the test you might be elected\nas a father of soldiers; it would surely set a good example to our\nimpecunious Hohenzollern bachelors for whom there are no wives.\"\n\nThe young Count evidently did not comprehend his mother's spirit of\nraillery. \"Has that not been tried?\" he asked, turning toward\nDr. Zimmern.\n\n\"It has,\" stated the Eugenist, \"more than a hundred years ago. There was\nonce an entire regiment of such Hohenzollern soldiers in the\nBavarian mines.\"\n\n\"And how did they turn out?\" I asked, my curiosity tempting me into\nindiscretion.\n\n\"They mutinied and murdered their officers and then held an election--\"\nZimmern paused and I caught his eye which seemed to say, \"We have gone\ntoo far with this.\"\n\n\"Yes, and what happened?\" queried the Countess.\n\n\"They all voted for themselves as Colonel,\" replied the Doctor drily.\n\nAt this I looked for an outburst of indignation from the orthodox\nAdmiral, but instead he seemed greatly elated. \"Of course,\" he enthused;\n\"the blood breeds true. It verily has the quality of true divinity. No\nwonder we super-men repudiated that spineless conception of the soft\nChristian God and the servile Jewish Jesus.\"\n\n\"But Jesus was not a coward,\" spoke up Marguerite. \"I have read the\nstory of his life; it is very wonderful; he was a brave man, who met his\ndeath unflinchingly.\"\n\n\"But where did you read it?\" asked the Countess. \"It must be very new. I\ntry to keep up on the late novels but I never heard of this 'Story\nof Jesus.'\"\n\n\"What you say is true,\" said the Admiral, turning to Marguerite, \"but\nsince you like to read so well, you should get Prof. Ohlenslagger's book\nand learn the explanation of the fact that you have just stated. We have\nlong known that all those great men whom the inferior races claim as\ntheir geniuses are of truth of German blood, and that the fighting\nquality of the outer races is due to the German blood that was scattered\nby our early emigrations.\n\n\"But the distinctive contribution that Prof. Ohlenslagger makes to these\nlong established facts is in regard to the parentage of this man Jesus.\nIn the Jewish accounts, which the Christians accepted, the truth was\ncrudely covered up with a most unscientific fable, which credited the\npaternity of Jesus to miraculous interference with the laws of nature.\n\n\"But now the truth comes out by Prof. Ohlenslagger's erudite reasoning.\nThis unknown father of Jesus was an adventurer from Central Asia, a man\nof Teutonic blood. On no other conception can the mixed elements in the\ncharacter of Jesus be explained. His was the case of a dual personality\nof conflicting inheritance. One day he would say: 'Lay up for yourself\ntreasures'--that was the Jewish blood speaking. The next day he would\nsay: 'I come to bring a sword'--that was the noble German blood of a\nTeutonic ancestor. It is logical, it must be true, for it was reasoned\nout by one of our most rational professors.\"\n\nThe Countess yawned; Marguerite sat silent with troubled brows; Dr.\nLudwig Zimmern gazed abstractedly toward the cold electric imitation of\na fire, above which on a mantle stood two casts, diminutive\nreproductions of the figures beside the door of the Emperor's palace,\nthe one the likeness of William the Great, the other the Statue of the\nGerman God. But I was thinking of the news I had heard that afternoon\nfrom my Ore Chief--that Captain Grauble's vessel had returned to Berlin.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nIN WHICH A WOMAN ACCUSES ME OF MURDER AND\nI PLACE A RUBY NECKLACE ABOUT HER THROAT\n\n\n~1~\n\nAnxious to renew my acquaintance with Captain Grauble at the earliest\nopportunity, I sent my social secretary to invite him to meet me for a\ndinner engagement in one of the popular halls of the Free Level.\n\nWhen I reached the dining hall I found Captain Grauble awaiting me. But\nhe was not alone. Seated with him were two girls and so strange a\npicture of contrast I had never seen. The girl on his right was an\nextreme example of the prevailing blonde type. Her pinkish white skin\nseemed transparent, her eyes were the palest blue and her hair was\nbright yet pale gold. About her neck was a chain of blue stones linked\nwith platinum. She was dressed in a mottled gown of light blue and gold,\nand so subtly blended were the colours that she and her gown seemed to\nbe part of the same created thing. But on Grauble's left sat a woman\nwhose gown was flashing crimson slashed with jetty black. Her skin was\nwhite with a positive whiteness of rare marble and her cheeks and lips\nflamed with blood's own red. The sheen of her hair was that of a raven's\nwing, and her eyes scintillated with the blackness of polished jade.\n\nThe pale girl, whom Grauble introduced as Elsa, languidly reached up her\npink fingers for me to kiss and then sank back, eyeing me with mild\ncuriosity. But as I now turned to be presented to the other, I saw the\nblack-eyed beauty shrink and cower in an uncanny terror. Grauble again\nrepeated my name and then the name of the girl, and I, too, started in\nfear, for the name he pronounced was \"Katrina\" and there flashed before\nmy vision the page from the diary that I had first read in the dank\nchamber of the potash mine. In my memory's vision the words flamed and\nshouted: \"In no other woman have I seen such a blackness of hair and\neyes, combined with such a whiteness of skin.\"\n\nThe girl before me gave no sign of recognition, but only gripped the\ntable and pierced me with the stare of her beady eyes. Nervously I sank\ninto a seat. Grauble, standing over the girl, looked down at her in\nangry amazement. \"What ails you?\" he said roughly, shaking her by\nthe shoulder.\n\nBut the girl did not answer him and annoyed and bewildered, he sat down.\nFor some moments no one spoke, and even the pale Elsa leaned forward and\nseemed to quiver with excitement.\n\nThen the girl, Katrina, slowly rose from her chair. \"Who are you?\" she\ndemanded, in a hoarse, guttural voice, still gazing at me with\nterrified eyes.\n\nI did not answer, and Grauble again reached over and gripped the girl's\narm. \"I told you who he was,\" he said. \"He is Herr Karl von Armstadt of\nthe Chemical Staff.\"\n\nBut, the girl did not sit down and continued to stare at me. Then she\nraised a trembling hand and, pointing an accusing finger at me, she\ncried in a piercing voice:\n\n\"You are not Karl Armstadt, but an impostor posing as Karl Armstadt!\"\n\nWe were located in a well-filled dancing caf\u00e9, and the tragic voice of\nthe accuser brought a crowd of curious people about our table. Captain\nGrauble waved them back. As they pushed forward again, a street guard\nelbowed in, brandishing his aluminum club and asking the cause of the\ncommotion. The bystanders indicated Katrina and the guard, edging up,\ngripped her arm and demanded an explanation.\n\nKatrina repeated her accusation.\n\n\"Evidently,\" suggested Grauble, \"she has known another man of the same\nname, and meeting Herr von Armstadt has recalled some tragic memory.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said the guard politely, \"if the gentleman would show the\nyoung lady his identification folder, she would be convinced of\nher error.\"\n\nFor a moment I hesitated, realizing full well what an inquiry might\nreveal.\n\n\"No,\" I said, \"I do not feel that it is necessary.\"\n\n\"He is afraid to show it,\" screamed the girl. \"I tell you he is trying\nto pass for Armstadt but he is some one else. He looks like Karl\nArmstadt and at first I thought he was Karl Armstadt, but I know he\nis not.\"\n\nI looked swiftly at the surrounding faces, and saw upon them suspicion\nand accusation. \"There may be something wrong,\" said a man in a military\nuniform, \"otherwise why should the gentleman of the staff hesitate to\nshow his folder?\"\n\n\"Very well,\" I said, pulling out my folder.\n\nThe guard glanced at it. \"It seems to be all right,\" he said, addressing\nthe group about the table; \"now will you kindly resume your seats and\nnot embarrass these gentlemen with your idle curiosity?\"\n\n\"Let me see the folder!\" cried Katrina.\n\n\"Pardon,\" said the guard to me, \"but I see no harm,\" and he handed her\nthe folder.\n\nShe glanced over it with feverish haste.\n\n\"Are you satisfied now?\" questioned the guard.\n\n\"Yes,\" hissed the black-eyed girl; \"I am satisfied that this is Karl\nArmstadt's folder. I know every word of it, but I tell you that the man\nwho carries it now is not the real Karl Armstadt.\" And then she wheeled\nupon me and screamed, \"You are not Karl Armstadt, Karl Armstadt is dead,\nand you have murdered him!\"\n\nIn an instant the caf\u00e9 was in an uproar. Men in a hundred types of\nuniform crowded forward; small women, rainbow-garbed, stood on the\nchairs and peered over taller heads of ponderous sisters of the labour\ncaste. Grauble again waved back the crowd and the guard brandished his\nclub threateningly toward some of the more inquisitive daughters\nof labour.\n\nWhen the crowd had fallen back to a more respectful distance, the guard\nrecovered my identification folder from Katrina and returned it to me.\n\"Perhaps,\" he said, \"you have known the young lady and do not again care\nto renew the acquaintance? If so, with your permission, I shall take her\nwhere she will not trouble you again this evening.\"\n\n\"That may be best,\" I replied, wondering how I could explain the affair\nto Captain Grauble.\n\n\"The incident is most unfortunate,\" said the Captain, evidently a little\nnettled, \"but I think this rude force unnecessary. I know Katrina well,\nbut I did not know she had previously known Herr von Armstadt. This\nbeing the case, and he seeming not to wish to renew the acquaintance, I\nsuggest that she leave of her own accord.\"\n\nBut Katrina was not to be so easily dismissed. \"No,\" she retorted, \"I\nwill not leave until this man tells me how he came by that\nidentification folder and what became of the man I loved, whom he now\nrepresents himself to be.\"\n\nAt these words the guard, who had been about to leave, turned back.\n\nI glanced apprehensively at Grauble who, seeing that I was grievously\nwrought up over the affair, said quietly to the officer, \"You had best\ntake her away.\"\n\nKatrina, with a black look of hatred at Grauble, went without further\nwords, and the curious crowd quickly melted away. The three of us who\nremained at the table resumed our seats and I ordered dinner.\n\n\"My, how Katrina frightened me!\" exclaimed the fragile Elsa.\n\n\"She does have temper,\" admitted Grauble. \"Odd, though, that she would\nconceive that idea that you were some one else. I have heard of all\nsorts of plans of revenge for disappointments in love, but that is a\nnew one.\"\n\n\"You really know her?\" questioned Elsa, turning her pale eyes upon me.\n\n\"Oh, yes, I once knew her,\" I replied, trying to seem unconcerned; \"but\nI did not recognize her at first.\"\n\n\"You mean you didn't care to,\" smiled Grauble. \"Once a man had known\nthat woman he would hardly forget her.\"\n\n\"But you must have had a very emotional affair with her,\" said Elsa, \"to\nmake her take on like that. Do tell us about it.\"\n\n\"I would rather not; there are some things one wishes to forget.\"\n\nGrauble chided his dainty companion for her prying curiosity and tried\nto turn the conversation into less personal channels. But Elsa's\nappetite for romance had been whetted and she kept reverting to the\nsubject while I worried along trying to dismiss the matter. But the\nending of the affair was not to be left in my hands; as we were sitting\nabout our empty cups, we saw Katrina re-enter the caf\u00e9 in company with a\nhigh official of the level and the guard who had taken her away.\n\n\"I am sorry to disturb you,\" said the official, addressing me\ncourteously, \"but this girl is very insistent in her accusation, and\nperhaps, if you will aid us in the matter, it may prevent her making\nfurther charges that might annoy you.\"\n\n\"And what do you wish me to do?\"\n\n\"I suggest only that you should come to my office. I have telephoned to\nhave the records looked up and that should satisfy all and so end\nthe matter.\"\n\n\"You might come also,\" added the official, turning to Grauble, but he\nwaved back the curious Elsa who was eager to follow.\n\nWhen we reached his office in the Place of Records, the official who had\nbrought us thither turned to a man at a desk. \"You have received the\ndata on missing men?\" he inquired.\n\nThe other handed him a sheet of paper.\n\nThe official turned to Katrina. \"Will you state again, please, the time\nthat you say the Karl Armstadt you knew disappeared?\"\n\nKatrina quite accurately named the date at which the man whose identity\nI had assumed had been called to the potash mines.\n\n\"Very well,\" said the official, taking up the sheet of paper, \"here we\nhave the list of missing men for four years compiled from the weighers'\nrecords. There is not recorded here the disappearance of a single\nchemist during the whole period. If another man than a chemist should\ntry to step into a chemist's shoes, he would have a rather difficult\ntime of it.\" The official laughed as if he thought himself very clever.\n\n\"But that man is not Karl Armstadt,\" cried Katrina in a wavering voice.\n\"Do you think I would not know him when every night for--\"\n\n\"Shut up,\" said the official, \"and get out of here, and if I hear\nanything more of this matter I shall subtract your credit.\"\n\nKatrina, now whimpering, was led from the room. The official beamed upon\nCapt. Grauble and myself. \"Do you see,\" he said, \"how perfectly our\nrecords take care of these crazy accusations? The black haired one is\nevidently touched in the head with jealousy, and now that she has\nchanced upon you, she makes up this preposterous story, which might\ncause you no end of annoyance, but here we have the absolute refutation\nof the charge. Before a man can step into another's shoes, he must step\nout of his own. Murdered bodies can be destroyed, although that is\ndifficult, but one man cannot be two men!\"\n\nWe left the official chuckling over his cleverness.\n\n\"The Keeper of Records was wise after his kind,\" mused Grauble, \"but it\nnever occurred to him that there might be chemists in the world who are\nnot registered in the card files of Berlin.\"\n\nGrauble's voice sounded a note of aloofness and suspicion. Had he\npenetrated my secret? Did I dare make full confession? Had Grauble given\nme the least encouragement I should have done so, but he seemed to wish\nto avoid further discussion and I feared to risk it.\n\nMy hope of a fuller understanding with Grauble seemed destroyed, and we\nsoon separated without further confidences.\n\n~2~\n\nWhen I returned home from my offices one evening some days later, my\nsecretary announced that a visitor was awaiting me.\n\nI entered the reception-room and found Holknecht, who had been my\nchemical assistant in the early days of my work in Berlin. Holknecht had\nseemed to me a servile fawning fellow and when I received my first\npromotion I had deserted him quite brutally for the very excellent\nreason that he had known the other Armstadt and I feared that his dulled\nintelligence might at any time be aroused to penetrate my disguise. That\nhe should look me up in my advancement and prosperity, doubtless to beg\nsome favour, seemed plausible enough, and therefore with an air of\ncondescending patronage, I asked what I could do for him.\n\n\"It is about Katrina,\" he said haltingly, as he eyed me curiously.\n\n\"Well, what about her?\"\n\n\"She wants me to bring you to her.\"\n\n\"But suppose I do not choose to go?\"\n\n\"Then there may be trouble.\"\n\n\"She has already tried to make trouble,\" I said, \"but nothing came of\nit.\"\n\n\"But that,\" said Holknecht, \"was before she saw me.\"\n\n\"And what have you told her?\"\n\n\"I told her about Armstadt's going to the mines and you coming back to\nthe hospital wearing his clothes and possessed of his folder and of your\nbeing out of your memory.\"\n\n\"You mean,\" I replied, determined not to acknowledge his assumption of\nmy other identity, \"that you explained to her how the illness had\nchanged me; and did that not make clear to her why she did not recognize\nme at first?\"\n\n\"There is no use,\" insisted Holknecht, \"of your talking like that. I\nnever could quite make up my mind about you, though I always knew there\nwas something wrong. At first I believed the doctor's story, and that\nyou were really Armstadt, though it did seem like a sort of magic, the\nway you were changed. But when you came to the laboratory and I saw you\nwork, I decided that you were somebody else and that the Chemical Staff\nwas working on some great secret and had a reason for putting some one\nelse in Armstadt's place. And now, of course, I know very well that that\nwas so, for the other Karl Armstadt would never have become a von of the\nRoyal Level. He didn't have that much brains.\"\n\nAs Holknecht was speaking I had been thinking rapidly. The thing I\nfeared was that the affair of the mine and hospital should be\ninvestigated by some one with intelligence and authority. Since Katrina\nhad learned of that, and this Holknecht was also aware that I was a man\nof unknown identity, it was very evident that they might set some\nserious investigation going. But the man's own remarks suggested a\nway out.\n\n\"You are quite right, Holknecht,\" I said; \"I am not Karl Armstadt; and,\njust as you have surmised, there were grave reasons why I should have\nbeen put into his place under those peculiar circumstances. But this\nmatter is a state secret of the Chemical Staff and you will do well to\nsay nothing about it. Now is there anything I can do for you? A\npromotion, perhaps, to a good position in the Protium Works?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Holknecht, \"I would rather stay where I am, but I could use a\nlittle extra money.\"\n\n\"Of course; a check, perhaps; a little gift from an old friend who has\nrisen to power; there would be no difficulty in that, would there?\"\n\n\"I think it would go through all right.\"\n\n\"I will make it now; say five thousand marks, and if nothing more is\nsaid of this matter by you or Katrina, there will be another one like it\na year later.\"\n\nThe young man's eyes gloated as I wrote the check, which he pocketed\nwith greedy satisfaction. \"Now,\" I said, \"will this end the affair for\nthe present?\"\n\n\"This makes it all right with me,\" replied Holknecht, \"but what about\nKatrina?\"\n\n\"But you are to take care of her. She can only accept two hundred marks\na month and I have given you enough for that four times over.\"\n\n\"But she doesn't want money; she already has a full list.\"\n\n\"Then what does she want?\"\n\n\"Jewels, of course; they all want them; jewels from the Royal Level, and\nshe knows you can get them for her.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see. Well, what would please her?\"\n\n\"A necklace of rubies, the best they have, one that will cost at least\ntwenty thousand marks.\"\n\n\"That's rather expensive, is it not?\"\n\n\"But her favourite lover disappeared,\" fenced Holknecht, \"and his death\nwas never entered on the records. It may be the Chemical Staff knows\nwhat became of him and maybe they do not; whatever happened, you seem to\nwant it kept still, so you had best get the necklace.\"\n\nAfter a little further arguing that revealed nothing, I went to the\nRoyal Level, and searching out a jewelry shop, I purchased a necklace of\nvery beautiful synthetic rubies, for which I gave my check for twenty\nthousand marks.\n\nReturning to my apartment, I found Holknecht still waiting. He insisted\non taking the necklace to Katrina, but I feared to trust a man who\naccepted bribes so shamelessly, and decided to go with him and deliver\nit in person.\n\nSullenly, Holknecht led the way to her apartment.\n\nKatrina sensuously gowned in flaming red was awaiting the outcome of her\nblackmailing venture. She motioned me to a chair near her, while\nHolknecht, utterly ignored, sank obscurely into a corner.\n\n\"So you came,\" said the lady of black and scarlet, leaning back among\nher pillows and gazing at me through half closed eyes.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"since you have looked up Holknecht and he has explained\nto you the reason for the disappearance of the man you knew, I thought\nbest to see you and have an understanding.\"\n\n\"But that dumb fellow explained nothing,\" declared Katrina, \"except that\nhe told me that Armstadt went to the mines and you came back and took\nhis place. He wasn't even sure you were not the other Karl Armstadt\nuntil I convinced him, and then he claimed that he had known it all the\ntime; and yet he had never told it. Some men are as dull as books.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, Holknecht is very sensible,\" I replied. \"It is a grave\naffair of state and one that it is best not to probe into.\"\n\n\"And just what did become of the other Armstadt?\" asked Katrina, and in\nher voice was only a curiosity, with no real concern.\n\n\"To tell you the truth, your lover was killed in the mine explosion,\" I\nreplied, for I thought it unwise to state that he was still alive lest\nshe pursue her inquiries for him and so make further trouble.\n\n\"That is too bad,\" said Katrina. \"You see, when I knew him he was only a\nchemical captain. And when he deserted me I didn't really care much. But\nwhen the Royal Captain Grauble asked me to meet a Karl von Armstadt of\nthe Chemical Staff, at first I could not believe that it was the same\nman I had known, but I made inquiries and learned of your rapid rise and\ntraced it back and I thought you really were my old Karl. And when I saw\nyou, you seemed to be he, but when I looked again I knew that you were\nanother and I was so disappointed and angry that I lost control of my\ntemper. I am sorry I made a scene, and that official was so stupid--as\nif I would not know one man from another! How I should like to tell him\nthat I knew more than his stupid records.\"\n\n\"But that is not best,\" I said; \"your former lover is dead and there are\ngrave reasons why that death should not be investigated further--\" The\nargument was becoming a little difficult for me and I hastened to add:\n\"Since you were so discourteously treated by the official, I feel that I\nowe you some little token of reparation.\"\n\nI now drew out the necklace and held it out to the girl.\n\nHer black eyes gleamed with triumph at the sight of the bauble. Greedily\nshe grasped it and held it up between her and the light, turning it\nabout and watching the red rays gleaming through the stones. \"And now,\"\nshe gloated, \"that faded Elsa will cease to lord it over me--and to\nthink that another Karl Armstadt has brought me this--why that stingy\nfellow would never have bought me a blue-stone ring, if he had been made\nthe Emperor's Minister.\"\n\nKatrina now rose and preened before her mirror. \"Won't you place it\nround my neck?\" she asked, holding out the necklace.\n\nNor daring to give offence, I took the chain of rubies and attempted to\nfasten it round her neck. The mechanism of the fastening was strange to\nme and I was some time in getting the thing adjusted. Just as I had\nsucceeded in hooking the clasp, I heard a curdled oath and the neglected\nHolknecht hurled himself upon us, striking me on the temple with one\nfist and clutching at the throat of the girl with the other hand.\n\nThe blow sent me reeling to the floor but in another instant I was up\nand had collared him and dragged him away.\n\n\"Damn you both,\" he whimpered; \"where do I come in?\"\n\n\"Put him out,\" said Katrina, with a glance of disdain at the cowering\nman.\n\n\"I will go,\" snarled Holknecht, and he wrenched from my grasp and darted\ntoward the door. I followed, but he was fairly running down the passage\nand pursuit was too undignified a thing to consider.\n\n\"You should have paid him,\" said Katrina, \"for delivering my message.\"\n\n\"I have paid him,\" I replied. \"I paid him very well.\"\n\n\"I wonder if he thought,\" she laughed, \"that I would pay any attention\nto a man of his petty rank. Why, I snubbed him unmercifully years ago\nwhen the other Armstadt had the audacity to introduce me.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" I replied, \"he does not understand.\"\n\nAnd now, as I resumed my seat, I began puzzling my brain as to how I\ncould get away without giving offence to the second member of my pair of\nblackmailers. But a little later I managed it, as it has been managed\nfor centuries, by looking suddenly at my watch and recalling a forgotten\nappointment.\n\n\"You will come again?\" purred Katrina.\n\n\"Of course,\" I said, \"I must come again, for you are very charming, but\nI am afraid it will not be for some time as I have very important duties\nand just at present my leisure is exceedingly limited.\"\n\nAnd so I made my escape, and hastened home. After debating the question\npro and con I typed a note to Holknecht in which I assured him that I\nhad not the least interest in Katrina. \"Perhaps,\" I wrote, \"when she has\ntired a bit of the necklace, she would appreciate something else. But it\nwould not be wise to hurry this; but if you will call around in a month\nor so, I think I can arrange for you to get her something and present it\nyourself, as I do not care to see her again.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nTHE BLACK SPOT IS ERASED FROM THE MAP OF THE WORLD AND\nTHERE IS DANCING IN THE SUNLIGHT ON THE ROOF OF BERLIN\n\n\n~1~\n\nThe relative ease with which I had so long passed for the real Karl\nArmstadt had lulled me into a feeling of security. But now that my\ndisguise had been penetrated, my old fears were renewed. True, the\nweigher's records had seemingly cleared me, but I knew that Grauble had\nseen the weak spot in the German logic of the stupid official, who had\nso lightly dismissed Katrina's accusations. Moreover, I fancied that\nGrauble had guessed the full truth and connected this uncertainty of my\nidentity with the seditious tenor of the suggestions I had made to him.\nEven though he might be willing to discuss rebellious plans with a\nGerman, could I count on him to consider the treasonable urging coming\nfrom a man of another and an enemy race?\n\nSo fearing either to confess to him my identity or to proceed without\nconfessing, I postponed doing anything. The sailing date of his fifth\ntrip to the Arctic was fast approaching; if I was ever to board a vessel\nleaving Berlin I would need von Kufner's permission. Marguerite reported\nthe growing cordiality of the Admiral. Although I realized that his\ninfatuation for her was becoming rather serious, with the confidence of\nan accepted lover, I never imagined that he could really come between\nMarguerite and myself.\n\nBut one evening when I went to call upon Marguerite she was \"not at\nhome.\" I repeated the call with the same result. When I called her up by\ntelephone, her secretary bluntly told me that the Princess Marguerite\ndid not care to speak to me. I hastened to write an impassioned note,\npleading to see her at once, for the days were passing and there was now\nbut a week before Grauble's vessel was due to depart.\n\nIn desperation I waited two more days, and still no word came. My\nletters of pleading, like my calls and telephone efforts, were\nstill ignored.\n\nThen a messenger came bearing a note from Admiral von Kufner, asking me\nto call upon him at once.\n\n\"I have been considering,\" began von Kufner, when I entered his office,\n\"the request you made of me some time ago to be permitted to go in\nperson to make a survey of the ore deposits. At first I opposed this, as\nthe trip is dangerous, but more recently I have reconsidered the\nimportance of it. As others are now fully able to continue your work\nhere, I can quite conceive that your risking the trip to the mines in\nperson would be a very courageous and noble sacrifice. So I have taken\nthe matter up with His Majesty.\"\n\nWith mocking politeness von Kufner now handed me a document bearing the\nimperial seal.\n\nI held it with a trembling hand as I glanced over the fateful words that\ncommissioned me to go at once to the Arctic.\n\nMy smouldering jealousy of the oily von Kufner now flamed into\nexpression. \"You have done this thing from personal motives,\" I cried.\n\"You have revoked your previous decision because you want me out of your\nway. You know I will be gone for six months at least. You hope in your\ncowardly heart that I will never come back.\"\n\nVon Kufner's lips curled. \"You see fit,\" he answered, \"to impugn my\nmotives in suggesting that the order be issued, although it is the\ngranting of your own request. But the commission you hold in your hand\nbears the Imperial signature, and the Emperor of the Germans never\nrevokes his orders.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" I said, controlling my rage, \"I will go.\"\n\n~2~\n\nUpon leaving the Admiral's office my first thought was to go at once to\nMarguerite. Whatever might be the nature of her quarrel with me I was\nnow sure that von Kufner was at the bottom of it, and that it was in\nsome way connected with this sudden determination of his to send me to\nthe Arctic, hoping that I would never return.\n\nBut before I had gone far I began to consider other matters. I was\ncommissioned to leave Berlin by submarine and that too by the vessel in\ncommand of Captain Grauble, whom I knew to be nursing rebellion and\nmutiny in his heart. If deliverance from Berlin was ever to come, it had\ncome now. To refuse to embrace it would mean to lose for ever this\nfortunate chance to escape from this sunless Babylon.\n\nI would therefore go first to Grauble and determine without delay if he\ncould be relied on to make the attempt to reach the outer world. Once I\nknew that, I could go then to Marguerite with an invitation for her to\njoin me in flight--if such a thing were humanly possible.\n\nBut recalling the men who had done so much to fill me with hope and\nfaith in the righteousness of my mission, I again changed my plan and\nsought out Dr. Zimmern and Col. Hellar and arranged for them to meet me\nthat evening at Grauble's quarters.\n\nAt the hour appointed I, who had first arrived at the apartment, sat\nwaiting for the arrival of Zimmern. When he came, to my surprise and\nbewildered joy he was not alone, for Marguerite was with him.\n\nShe greeted me with distress and penitence in her eyes and I exulted in\nthe belief that whatever her quarrel with me might be it meant no\nirretrievable loss of her devotion and love.\n\nWe sat about the room, a very solemn conclave, for I had already\ninformed Grauble of my commission to go to the Arctic, and he had sensed\nat once the revolutionary nature of the meeting. I now gave him a brief\nstatement of the faith of the older men, who from the fulness of their\nlives had reached the belief that the true patriotism for their race was\nto be expressed in an effort to regain for the Germans the citizenship\nof the world.\n\nThe young Captain gravely nodded. \"I have not lived so long,\" he said,\n\"but my life has been bitter and full of fear. I am not out of sympathy\nwith your argument, but before we go further,\" and he turned to\nMarguerite, \"may I not ask why a Princess of the House of Hohenzollern\nis included in such a meeting as this?\"\n\nI turned expectantly to Zimmern, who now gave Grauble an account of the\ntragedy and romance of Marguerite's life.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Grauble; \"she has earned her place with us; now that I\nunderstand her part, let us proceed.\"\n\nFor some hours Hellar and Zimmern explained their reasons for believing\nthe life of the isolated German race was evil and defended their faith\nin the hope of salvation through an appeal to the mercy and justice of\nthe World State.\n\n\"Of all this I am easily convinced,\" said Grauble, \"for it is but a\nlogically thought-out conclusion of the feeling I have nourished in my\nblind rebellion. I am ready to go with Herr von Armstadt and surrender\nmy vessel to the enemy; but the practical question is, will our risk\navail anything? What hope can we have that we will even be able to\ndeliver the message you wish to send? How are we to know that we will\nnot immediately be killed?\"\n\nThe hour had come. \"I will answer that question,\" I said, and there was\na tenseness in my tone that caused my hearers to look at me with eager,\nquestioning eyes.\n\n\"Barring,\" I said, \"the possibility of destruction before I can gain\nopportunity to speak to some one in authority, there is nothing to fear\nin the way of our ungracious reception in the outer world--\" As I paused\nand looked about me I saw Marguerite's eyes shining with the same\nworshipful wonder as when I had visioned for her the sunlight and the\nstorms of the world outside Berlin--\"because I am of that world. I speak\ntheir language. I know their people. I never saw the inside of Berlin\nuntil I was brought here from the potash mines of Stassfurt, wearing the\nclothes and carrying the identification papers of one Karl Armstadt who\nwas killed by gas bombs which I myself had ordered dropped into\nthose mines.\"\n\nAt these startling statements the older men could only gasp in\nincredulous astonishment, but Captain Grauble nodded wisely--\"I half\nexpected as much,\" he said.\n\nI turned to Marguerite. Her eyes were swimming in a mist of tears.\n\n\"Then your visions were real memories,\" she cried,--\"and not miracles. I\nknew you had seen other worlds, but I thought it was in some spirit\nlife.\" She reached out a trembling hand toward me and then shrinkingly\ndrew it back. \"But you are not Karl Armstadt,\" she stammered, as she\nrealized that I was a nameless stranger.\n\n\"No,\" I said, going to her and placing a reassuring arm about her\nshoulder, \"I am not Karl Armstadt. My name is Lyman de Forrest. I am an\nAmerican, a chemical engineer from the city of Chicago, and if Captain\nGrauble does not alter his purpose, I am going back there and will take\nyou with me.\"\n\nZimmern and Hellar were listening in consternation. \"How is it,\" asked\nHellar, \"that you speak German?\"\n\nBy way of answer I addressed him in English and in French, while he and\nZimmern glanced at each other as do men who see a miracle and strive to\nhold their reason while their senses contradict their logic.\n\nI now sketched the story of my life and adventures with a fulness of\nconvincing detail. One incident only I omitted and that was of the near\ndiscovery of my identity by Armstadt's former mistress. Of that I did\nnot speak for I felt that Marguerite, at least in the presence of the\nothers, would not relish that part of the story. Nor did I wish to worry\nthem with the fear that was still upon me that I had not seen the last\nof that affair.\n\nAfter answering many questions and satisfying all doubts as to the truth\nof my story, I again turned the conversation to the practical problem of\nthe escape from Berlin. \"You can now see,\" I declared, \"that I deserve\nno credit for genius or courage. I am merely a prisoner in an enemy city\nwhere my life is in constant danger. If any one of you should speak the\nword, I would be promptly disposed of as a spy. But if you are sincere\nin your desire to send a message to my Government, I am here to take\nthat message.\"\n\n\"It almost makes one believe that there is a God,\" cried Hellar, \"and\nthat he has sent us a deliverer.\"\n\n\"As for me,\" spoke up Captain Grauble, \"I shall deliver your messenger\ninto the hands of his friends, and trust that he can persuade them to\ndeal graciously with me and my men. I should have made this break for\nliberty before had I not believed it would be fleeing from one death\nto another.\"\n\n\"Then you will surely leave us,\" said Zimmern. \"It is more than we have\nwished and prayed for, but,\" he added, turning a compassionate glance\ntoward Marguerite, \"it will be hard for her.\"\n\n\"But she is going with us,\" I affirmed. \"I will not leave her behind. As\nfor you and Col Hellar, I shall see you again when Berlin is free. But\nthe risks are great and the time may be long, and if Marguerite will go\nI will take her with me as a pledge that I shall not prove false in my\nmission for you, her people.\"\n\nI read Marguerite's answer in the joy of her eyes, as I heard Col.\nHellar say: \"That would be fine, if it were possible.\"\n\nBut Zimmern shook his head. \"No,\" he said, as if commanding. \"Marguerite\nmust not go now even if it were possible. You may come back for her if\nyou succeed in your mission, but we cannot lose her now; she must not go\nnow,--\" and his voice trembled with deep emotion. At his words of\nauthority concerning the girl I loved I felt a resurge of the old\nsuspicion and jealousy.\n\n\"I am sorry,\" spoke up Captain Grauble, \"but your desire to take the\nPrincess Marguerite with you is one that I fear cannot be realized. I\nwould be perfectly willing for her to go if we could once get her\naboard, but the approach of the submarine docks are very elaborately\nguarded. To smuggle a man aboard without a proper permit would be\nexceedingly difficult, but to get a woman to the vessel is quite\nimpossible.\"\n\n\"I suppose that it cannot be,\" I said, for I saw the futility of arguing\nthe matter further at the time, especially as Zimmern was opposed to it.\n\nThe night was now far spent and but four days remained in which to\ncomplete my preparations for departure. In this labour Zimmern and\nHellar could be of no service and I therefore took my leave of them,\nlest I should not see them again. \"Within a year at most,\" I said, \"we\nmay meet again, for Berlin will be open to the world. Once the passage\nis revealed and the protium traffic stopped, the food stores cannot last\nlonger. When these facts are realized by His Majesty and the Advisory\nCouncil, let us hope they will see the futility of resisting. The\nknowledge that Germany possesses will increase the world's food supply\nfar more than her population will add to the consumptive demands, hence if\nreason and sanity prevail on both sides there will be no excuse for war\nand suffering.\"\n\n~3~\n\nAnd so I took my leave of the two men from whose noble souls I had\nachieved my aspirations to bring the century-old siege of Berlin to a\nsane and peaceful end without the needless waste of life that all the\nworld outside had always believed would be an inevitable part of the\ncapitulation of the armoured city.\n\nI now walked with Marguerite through the deserted tree-lined avenues of\nthe Royal Level.\n\n\"And why, dear,\" I asked, \"have you refused to see me these five days\npast?\"\n\n\"Oh, Karl,\" she cried, \"you must forgive me, for nothing matters now--I\nhave been crazed with jealousy. I was so hurt that I could see no one,\nfor I could only fight it out alone.\"\n\n\"And what do you mean?\" I questioned. \"Jealous? And of whom could you be\njealous, since there is no other woman in this unhappy city for whom I\nhave ever cared?\"\n\n\"Yes, I believe that. I haven't doubted that you loved me with a nobler\nlove than the others, but you told me there were no others, and I\nbelieved you. So it was hard, so very hard. The Doctor--I saw Dr.\nZimmern this morning and poured out my heart to him--insisted that I\nshould accept the fact that until marriage all men were like that, and\nit could not be helped. But I never asked you, Karl, about other women;\nyou yourself volunteered to tell me there were no others, and what you\ntold me was not true. I must forgive you, for now I may lose you, but\nwhy does a man ever need to lie to a woman? I somehow feel that love\nmeans truth--\"\n\n\"But,\" I insisted, \"it was the truth. I bear no personal relation to any\nother woman.\"\n\nShe drew back from me, breathing quickly, faith and doubt fighting a\nbattle royal in her eyes. \"But the checks, Karl?\" she stammered; \"those\nchecks the girl on the Free Level cashes each month, and worse than that\nthe check at the Jeweller's where you bought a necklace for twenty\nthousand marks?\"\n\n\"Quite right, there are such checks, and I shall explain them. But\nbefore I begin, may I ask just how you came to know about those checks?\nNot that I care; I am glad you do know; but the fact of your knowledge\npuzzles me, for I thought the privacy of a man's checking account was\none of the unfair privileges that man has usurped for himself and not\ngranted to women.\"\n\n\"But I did not pry into the matter. I would never have thought of such a\nthing until he forced the facts upon me.\"\n\n\"He? You mean von Kufner?\"\n\n\"Yes, it was five days ago. I was out walking with him and he insisted\non my going into a jewellery store we were passing. I at first refused\nto go as I thought he wished to buy me something. But he insisted that\nhe merely wanted me to look at things and I went in. You see, I was\ntrying not to offend him.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" I said, \"there was no harm in that. And--\"\n\n\"The Admiral winked at the Jeweller. I saw him do that; and the jeweller\nset out a tray of ruby necklaces and began to talk about them, and then\nvon Kufner remarked that since they were so expensive he must not sell\nmany. 'Oh, yes,' said the Jeweller, 'I sell a great number to young men\nwho have just come into money. I sold one the other day to Herr von\nArmstadt of the Chemical Staff,' and he reached for his sales book and\nopened it to the page with a record of the sale. He had the place\nmarked, for I saw him remove a slip as he opened the book.\"\n\n\"Rather clever of von Kufner,\" I commented; \"how do you suppose he got\ntrail of it?\"\n\n\"He admitted his trailing quite frankly,\" said Marguerite, \"for as soon\nas we were out of the shop, I accused him of preparing the scene. 'Of\ncourse,' he said, 'but I had to convince you that your chemist was not\nso saintly as you thought him. His banker is a friend of mine, and I\nasked him about von Armstadt's account. He is keeping a girl on the Free\nLevel and evidently also making love to one of better caste, or he would\nhardly be buying ruby necklaces.' I told von Kufner that he was a\nmiserable spy, but he only laughed at me and said that all men were\nalike and that I ought to find it out while I was young--and then he\nasked if I would like him to have the young woman's record sent up from\nthe Free Level for my inspection. I ordered him to leave me at once and\nI have not seen or heard from him since, until I received a note from\nhim today telling me of the Royal order for you to go to the Arctic.\"\n\nI first set Marguerite's mind at ease about the checks to Bertha by\nexplaining the incident of the geography, and then told the story of\nKatrina and the meeting in the caf\u00e9, and the later affair of Holknecht\nand the necklace.\n\n\"And you will promise me never to see her again?\"\n\n\"But you have forgotten,\" I said, \"that I am leaving Berlin in four\ndays.\"\n\n\"Oh, Karl,\" she cried, \"I have forgotten everything--I cannot even\nremember that new name you gave us--I believe I must be dreaming--or\nthat it is all a wild story you have told us to see how much we in our\nsimplicity and ignorance will believe.\"\n\n\"No,\" I said gently, \"it is not a dream, though I could wish that it\nwere, for Grauble says that there is no hope of taking you with me; and\nyet I must go, for the Emperor has ordered me to the Arctic and von\nKufner will see to it that I make no excuses. If I once leave Berlin by\nsubmarine with Grauble I do not see how I can refuse to carry out my\npart of this project to which I am pledged, and make the effort to reach\nthe free world outside.\"\n\nMarguerite turned on me with a bitter laugh. \"The free world,\" she\ncried, \"your world. You are going back to it and leave me here. You are\ngoing back to your own people--you will not save Germany at all--you\nwill never come back for me!\"\n\n\"You are very wrong,\" I said gently. \"It is because I have known you and\nknown such men as Dr. Zimmern and Col. Hellar that I do want to carry\nthe message that will for ever end this sunless life of your\nimprisoned race.\"\n\n\"But,\" cried Marguerite, \"you do not want to take me; you could find a\nway if you would--you made the Emperor do your bidding once--you could\ndo it again if you wanted to.\"\n\n\"I very much want to take you; to go without you would be but a bitter\nsuccess.\"\n\n\"But have you no wife, or no girl you love among your own people?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"But if I should go with you, the people of your world would welcome you\nbut they would imprison me or kill me as a spy.\"\n\n\"No,\" and I smiled as I answered, \"they do not kill women.\"\n\n~4~\n\nDuring four brief days that remained until Capt. Grauble's vessel was\ndue to depart my every hour was full of hurried preparations for my\nsurvey of the Arctic mines. Clothing for the rigours and rough labour of\nthat fearful region had to be obtained and I had to get together the\nreports of previous surveys and the instruments for the ore analyses\nthat would be needed. Nor was I altogether faithless in these\npreparations for at times I felt that my first duty might be thus to aid\nin the further provisioning of the imprisoned race, for how was I to\nknow that I would be able to end the state of war that had prevailed in\nspite of the generations of pacifist efforts? At times I even doubted\nthat this break for the outer world would ever be made. I doubted that\nCapt. Grauble, though he solemnly assured us that he was ready for the\nventure, was acting in good faith. Could he, I asked, persuade his men\nto their part of the adventure? Would not our traitorous design be\ndiscovered and we both be returned as prisoners to Berlin? Granted even\nthat Grauble could carry out his part and that the submarine proceeded\nas planned to rise to the surface or attempt to make some port, with the\nbest of intentions of surrendering to the World State authorities, might\nnot we be destroyed before we could make clear our peaceful and friendly\nintentions? Could I, coming out of Germany with Germans prove my\nidentity? Would my story be believed? Would I have believed such a story\nbefore the days of my sojourn among the Germans? Might I not be\nconsigned to languish in prison as a merely clever German spy, or be\nconsigned to an insanity ward?\n\nAt times I doubted even my own desire to escape from Berlin if it meant\nthe desertion of Marguerite, for there could be no joy in escape for me\nwithout her. Yet I found small relish in looking forward to life as a\nmember of that futile clan of parasitical Royalty. Had Germany been a\nfree society where we might hope to live in peace and freedom perhaps I\ncould have looked forward to a marriage with Marguerite and considered\nlife among the Germans a tolerable thing. But for such a life as we must\nneeds live, albeit the most decent Berlin had to offer, I could find no\nrelish--and the thought of escape and call of duty beyond the bomb proof\nwalls and poisoned soil called more strongly than could any thought of\nlove and domesticity within the accursed circle of fraudulent divinity.\n\nThere was also the danger that lurked for me in Holknecht's knowledge of\nmy identity and the bitterness of his anger born of his insane and\nstupid jealousy.\n\nRather than remain longer in Berlin I would take any chance and risk any\ndanger if only Marguerite were not to be left behind. And yet she must\nbe left behind, for such a thing as getting a woman aboard a submarine\nor even to the submarine docks had never been heard of. I thought of all\nthe usual tricks of disguising her as a man, of smuggling her as a\nstowaway amidst the cargo, but Grauble's insistence upon the\nimpossibility of such plans had made it all too clear that any such wild\nattempt would lead to the undoing of us all.\n\nIf escape were possible with Marguerite--! But cold reason said that\nescape was improbable enough for me alone. For a woman of the House of\nHohenzollern the prison of Berlin had walls of granite and locks\nof steel.\n\nThe time of departure drew nearer. I had already been passed down by the\nstealthy guards and through the numerous locked and barred gates to the\nsubterranean docks where Grauble's vessel, the _Eitel 3_, rested on the\nheavy trucks that would bear her away through the tunnel to the\npneumatic lock that would float her into the passage that led to\nthe open sea.\n\nMy supplies and apparatus were stored on board and the crew were making\nready to be off. But three hours were left until the time of our\ndeparture and these hours I had set aside for my final leave-taking of\nMarguerite. I hastened back through the guarded gates to the elevator\nand was quickly lifted to the Royal Level where Marguerite was to be\nwaiting for me.\n\nWith fast beating and rebellious heart I rang the bell of the Countess'\napartment. I could scarcely believe I heard aright when the servant\ninformed me that the Princess Marguerite had gone out.\n\nI demanded to see the Countess and was ushered into the reception-room\nand suffered unbearably during the few minutes till she appeared. To my\nexcited question she replied with a teasing smile that Marguerite had\ngone out a half hour before with Admiral von Kufner. \"I warned you,\"\nsaid the Countess as she saw the tortured expression of my face, \"but\nyou would not believe me, when I told you the Admiral would prove a\ndangerous man.\"\n\n\"But it is impossible,\" I cried. \"I am leaving for the Arctic mines. I\nhave only a couple of hours; surely you are hiding something. Did you\nsee her go? Did she leave no word? Do you know where they have gone or\nwhen they will return?\"\n\nThe Countess shook her head. \"I only know,\" she replied more\nsympathetically, \"that Marguerite seemed very excited all morning. She\ntalked with me of your leaving and seemed very wrought up over it, and\nthen but an hour or so ago she rushed into her room and telephoned--it\nmust have been to the Admiral, for he came shortly afterwards. They\ntalked together for a little while and then, without a word to me they\nwent out, seeming to be in a great hurry. Perhaps she felt so upset over\nyour leaving that she thought it kinder not to risk a parting scene. She\nis so honest, poor child, that she probably did not wish to send you\naway with any false hopes.\"\n\n\"But do you mean,\" I cried, \"that you think she has gone out with von\nKufner to avoid seeing me?\"\n\n\"I am sorry,\" consoled the Countess, \"but it looks that way. It was\ncruel of her, for she might have sent you away with hope to live on till\nyour return, even if she felt she could not wait for you.\"\n\nI strove not to show my anger to the Countess, for, considering her\nignorance of the true significance of the occasion, I could not expect a\nfull understanding.\n\nMiserably I waited for two hours as the Countess tried to entertain me\nwith her misplaced efforts at sympathy while I battled to keep my faith\nin Marguerite alive despite the damaging evidence that she had deserted\nme at the last hour.\n\nI telephoned to von Kufner's office and to his residence but could get\nno word as to his whereabouts, and Marguerite did not return.\n\nI dared not wait any longer--asking for envelope and paper, I penned a\nhasty note to Marguerite: \"I shall go on to the Arctic and come back to\nyou. The salvation of Berlin must wait till you can go with me. I\ncannot, will not, lose you.\"\n\nAnd then I tore myself away and hastened to the elevator and was dropped\nto a subterranean level and passed again through the locked and\nguarded gates.\n\n~5~\n\nAs I came to the vessel no one was in sight but the regular guards\npacing along the loading docks. I mounted the ladder to the deck. The\nsecond officer stood by the open trap. \"They are waiting for you,\" he\nsaid. \"The Admiral himself is below. He came with his lady to see\nyou off.\"\n\nI hastened to descend and saw von Kufner and Marguerite chatting with\nCaptain Grauble.\n\n\"Why the delay?\" asked von Kufner. \"It is nearly the hour of departure,\nand I have brought the Princess to bid you farewell. We have been\nshowing her the vessel.\"\n\n\"It is all very wonderful,\" said Marguerite with a calm voice, but her\neyes spoke the feverish excitement of a great adventure.\n\n\"The Princess Marguerite,\" said von Kufner, \"is the only woman who has\never seen a submarine since the open sea traffic was closed. But she has\nseen it all and now we must take our leave for it is time that you\nshould be off.\"\n\nAs he finished speaking the Admiral politely stepped away to give me\nopportunity for a farewell word with Marguerite. Grauble followed him\nand, as he passed me, he gave me a look of gloating triumph and then\nopened the door of his cabin, which the Admiral entered.\n\n\"I am going with you,\" whispered Marguerite. \"Grauble understands.\"\n\nThere was the sound of a scuffle and a strangled oath. Grauble's head\nappeared at the cabin door. \"Here, Armstadt; be quick, and keep\nhim quiet.\"\n\nI plunged into the cabin and saw von Kufner crumpled against the bunk;\nhis hands were manacled behind him and his mouth stuffed with a cloth.\n\nWith an exulting joy I threw myself upon the man as he struggled to\nrise. I easily held him down, and whipping out my own kerchief I bound\nit tightly across his mouth to more effectively gag him.\n\nThen rolling him over I planted my knee on his back while I ripped a\nsheet from the bunk and bound his feet.\n\nFrom without I heard Grauble's voice in command: \"Close the hatch.\" Then\nI felt the vessel quiver with machinery in motion and I knew that we\nwere moving along the tunnel toward the sea.\n\nGrauble appeared again in the door of the cabin. \"The mate understands,\"\nhe said, \"and the crew will obey. I told them that the Admiral was going\nout with us to inspect the lock. But the presence of a woman aboard will\npuzzle them. I have placed the Princess in the mate's cabin so no one\ncan molest her. We have other things to keep us occupied.\"\n\nWith Grauble's help I now bound von Kufner to the staunch metal leg of\nthe bunk and we left him alone in the narrow room to ponder on the\nmeaning of what he had heard.\n\nOutside Grauble led me over to the instrument board where the mate was\nstationed.\n\n\"Any unusual message?\" asked Grauble.\n\n\"None,\" said the mate. \"I think we will go through without interruption\nat least until we reach the lock; if anything is suspicioned we will be\nheld up there for examination.\"\n\n\"Do you think the guards at the dock suspected anything?\" questioned\nGrauble.\n\n\"It is not likely,\" replied the mate. \"They saw him come aboard, but he\nspoke to none of them. They will presume he is going out to the lock.\nThe presence of a woman will puzzle them; but, as she was with the\nAdmiral, they will not dare interfere or even report the fact.\"\n\n\"Then what do you think we have to fear?\" asked Grauble.\n\n\"Only the chance that the Admiral's absence may be noted at his office\nand inquiry be made.\"\n\n\"Of that the Princess could tell us something,\" said Grauble. \"We will\ntalk with her.\"\n\nGrauble now led me to the mate's snug cabin, where we found Marguerite\nseated on the bunk, looking very pale and anxious.\n\n\"Everything is going nicely, so far,\" the Captain assured her. \"We have\nonly one thing to fear, and that is that inquiry from the Administration\nOffice for the Admiral may be addressed to the Commander of the Lock.\"\n\n\"But how will they know that he is with us?\" asked Marguerite. \"Will the\nguards report it?\"\n\n\"I do not think so,\" said Grauble, \"but does any one at his office know\nthat he came to the docks?\"\n\n\"I do not see how they could,\" replied Marguerite; \"he was at his\napartment when I called him. He came to me at once, not knowing why I\nwished to see him. I begged him to take me to see you off. I swore that\nif he did not I should never speak to him again, and he agreed to do so.\nHe seemed to think himself very generous and talked much of the\ndistinctive privilege he was conferring upon me by acceding to my\nrequest. But he told no one where we were going. He communicated with no\none from the time he came to me until we arrived at the vessel. The\nguards and gate-keepers let us pass without question.\"\n\n\"That is fine,\" cried Grauble; \"von Kufner often stays away from his\noffice for days at a time. Unless some chance information leaks back\nfrom the guards, he will not be missed. Our chance of being passed\nspeedily out the lock is good--there is a vessel due to lock in this\nvery day and we could not be held back to block the tunnel. That is why\nthe Admiral was impatient when Armstadt failed to appear; he knew our\ndeparture ought not be delayed.\"\n\n\"And what,\" I asked, \"do you propose to do with the Admiral?\"\n\n\"I suppose we must take him with us as a prisoner,\" replied the Captain.\n\"Your World State Government would appreciate a prisoner of the House of\nHohenzollern.\"\n\nAt this suggestion Marguerite shook her head emphatically. \"I do not\nlike that,\" she said. \"Is there not some way to leave him behind?\"\n\n\"I do not like it either,\" said Grauble, \"because I fear his presence\naboard may make trouble among my men. I do not think they will object to\ndeserting with us to the free world. Their life in this service is\nhopeless enough and this is my fifth trip; they have a belief that the\nCaptain's fifth trip is an ill-fated one; not a man aboard but trembles\nin the dire fear that he will never see Berlin again. They will welcome\nwith joy a proposal to escape with us, but to ask them to make the\nattempt with the Admiral himself on board as a prisoner is a different\nthing. These men are cowed by authority and I know not what notions they\nmight have of their fate if they are to kidnap the Admiral.\"\n\n\"But,\" I questioned, \"is there no possible way to leave him behind?\"\n\nGrauble sat thinking for a moment. \"Yes,\" he said, \"there is one way we\nmight do it. We could shave his beard and clip his hair, dress him in a\nmachinist's garb and smear his hands and face with grease. Then I could\ndrug him and we could carry him off at the lock and put him in a cell. I\nwould report that one of my men had gone raving mad, and I had drugged\nhim to keep him from doing injury to himself and others. It would create\nno great surprise. Men in this service frequently go mad; and I am\nprovided with a sleep producing drug for just such emergencies.\"\n\n\"Then go ahead,\" I said.\n\n\"But you will lose the satisfaction of delivering him prisoner to your\ngovernment,\" smiled Grauble.\n\n\"I have no love for the Admiral,\" I replied, \"but I think his punishment\nwill be more appropriately attended to in Berlin. When our escape is\nknown he will indeed have a rather difficult time explaining to\nHis Majesty.\"\n\nThis suggestion of the pompous Admiral's predicament if thus left behind\nseemed to amuse Grauble and he at once led the way back to his\nown cabin.\n\nVon Kufner was lying very quietly in his bonds and glared up at us with\na weak and futile rage. Grauble smiled cynically at his prostrate chief.\n\"I had thought to take you along with us,\" he said, \"but I am afraid the\nexcitement of the voyage would be unpleasant for you so I have decided\nto leave you at the lock to take our farewell back to His Majesty.\"\n\nVon Kufner, helpless and gagged was given no opportunity to reply, for\nGrauble, unlocking his medicine case took out a small hypodermic syringe\nand plunged the needle into the prisoner's thigh.\n\nIn a few minutes the Admiral was unconscious. The Captain now brought a\nsuit of soiled mechanic's clothes and a clipper and razor, and in a half\nhour the prim Admiral in his fancy uniform had been reduced to the\nlikeness of an oiler. His face roughly shaved, but pale and sallow, gave\na very good simulation of illness of mind and body.\n\n\"He will remain like that for at least twelve hours,\" said Grauble. \"I\ngave him a heavy dose.\"\n\nAgain we went out, locking the unconscious Admiral in the cabin. \"You\nmay go and keep the Princess company,\" said Grauble, \"while I talk with\nmy men and give them an inkling of what we are planning. If there is any\ntrouble at the lock it is better that they comprehend that hope of\nfreedom is in store for them.\"\n\nAmid tears of joy Marguerite now told me of her belated conception of\nthe desperate plan to induce von Kufner to bring her to the docks to see\nus depart, and how she had pretended to disbelieve that I was really\ngoing and bargained to marry him within sixty days if she could be\nassured by her own eyes that I had really departed for the Arctic.\n\nAs we waited feverishly for the first nerve-racking part of the journey\nto be over, we spoke of the hopes and dangers of the great adventure\nupon which we were finally embarked. And so the hours passed.\n\nAt last we felt the rumble of the motors die and knew that the movement\nof the vessel had ceased.\n\n~6~\n\nThe voice of the mate spoke at the door: \"Remain quiet inside,\" he said,\nand a key turned and clicked the bolt of the lock. The tense minutes\npassed. Again the key turned in the door and the mate stuck his head\ninside. \"Come quick,\" he said to me.\n\nI followed him into Capt. Grauble's cabin, but saw Grauble nowhere.\n\n\"Remove your clothing,\" said the mate, as he seized a sponge and soap\nand began washing the blackened oil from the hands and face of the\nunconscious Admiral. \"We must dress him in your uniform. The Commander\nof the Lock has orders to take you off the vessel. We must pass the\nAdmiral off for you. He will never be recognized. The Commander has\nnever seen you.\"\n\nObeying, without fully comprehending, I helped to quickly dress the\nunconscious man in my own clothing. We had barely finished when we heard\nvoices outside.\n\n\"Quick, under the bunk,\" whispered the mate. As I obediently crawled\ninto the hiding place, the mate kicked in after me the remainder of the\noiler's clothing which I had been trying to put on and pulled the\ndisarranged bedding half off the bunk the better to hide me. Then he\nopened the door and several men entered.\n\n\"I had to drug him,\" said Grauble's voice, \"because he was so violent\nwith fear when I had him manacled that I thought he might attempt to\nbeat out his brains.\"\n\n\"Let me see his papers,\" said a strange voice.\n\nAfter a brief interval the same voice spoke again--\"These are identical\nwith the description given by His Majesty's secretary. There can be no\ndoubt that this is the man they want, but I do not see how an enemy spy\ncould ever pass for a German, even if he had the clothing and\nidentification. He does not even look like the description in the\nfolder. The chemists must be very stupid to have accepted him as one\nof them.\"\n\n\"It is strange,\" replied the voice of Capt. Grauble, \"but this man was\nvery clever.\"\n\n\"It is only that most men are very dull,\" replied the other voice. \"Now\nI should have suspected at once that the man was not a German. But he\nshall answer for his cleverness. Let him be removed at once. We have\nword from the vessel outside that they are short of oxygen, and you must\nbe locked out and clear the passage.\"\n\nWith a shuffling of many feet the form of the third bearer of Karl\nArmstadt's pedigree was carried from the cabin, and the door was\nkicked shut.\n\nI was still lying cramped in my hiding place when I felt the vessel\nmoving again. Then a sailor came, bringing a case from which I took\nfresh clothing. As I was dressing I felt my ear drums pain from the\nincreased air pressure, and I heard, as from a great distance, the roar\nof the water being let into the lock. From the quiet swaying of the\nfloor beneath me I soon sensed that we were afloat. I waited in the\ncabin until I felt the quiver of motors, now distinguished by the lesser\nthrob and smoother running, from the drive on the wheeled trucks through\nthe tunnel.\n\nI opened the cabin door and went out. Grauble was at the instrument\nboard. The mate stood aft among the motor controls; all men were at\ntheir posts, for we were navigating the difficult subterranean passage\nthat led to the open sea.\n\nAs I approached Grauble he spoke without lifting his eyes from his\ninstruments. \"Go bring the Princess out of her hiding; I want my men to\nsee her now. It will help to give them faith.\"\n\nMarguerite came with me and stood trembling at my side as we watched\nGrauble, whose eyes still riveted upon the many dials and indicators\nbefore him.\n\n\"Watch the chart,\" said Grauble. \"The red hand shows our position.\"\n\nThe chart before him was slowly passing over rolls. For a time we could\nonly see a straight line thereon bordered by many signs and figures.\nThen slowly over the topmost roll came the wavy outlines of a shore, and\nthe parallel lines marking the depths of the bordering sea. Tensely we\nwatched the chart roll slowly down till the end of the channel passed\nthe indicator.\n\nGrauble breathed a great sigh of relief and for the first time turned\nhis face towards us. \"We are in the open sea,\" he said, \"at a depth of\n160 metres. I shall turn north at once and parallel the coast. You had\nbetter get some rest; for the present nothing can happen. It is night\nabove now but in six more hours will be the dawn, then we shall rise and\ntake our bearings through the periscope.\"\n\nI led Marguerite into the Captain's cabin and insisted that she lie down\non the narrow berth. Seated in the only chair, I related what I knew of\nthe affair at the locks. \"It must have been,\" I concluded, after much\nspeculation, \"that Holknecht finally got the attention of the Chemical\nStaff and related what he knew of the incident of the potash mines. They\nhad enough data about me to have arrived at the correct conclusion long\nago. It was a question of getting the facts together.\"\n\n\"It was that,\" said Marguerite, \"or else I am to blame.\"\n\n\"And what do you mean?\" I asked.\n\n\"I mean,\" she said, \"that I took a great risk about which I must tell\nyou, for it troubles my conscience. After I had sent for the Admiral and\nhe had promised to come, I telephoned to Dr. Zimmern of my intention to\nget von Kufner to take me to the docks and my hope that I could come\nwith you. And it may be that some one listened in on our conversation.\"\n\n\"I do not see,\" I said, \"how such a conversation should lead to the\ndiscovery of my identity--the Holknecht theory is more reasonable--but\nyou did take a risk. Why did you do it?\"\n\n\"I wanted to tell him good-bye,\" said Marguerite. \"It was hard enough\nthat I could not see him.\" And she turned her face to the pillow and\nbegan to weep.\n\n\"What is it, my dear?\" I pleaded, as I knelt beside her. \"It was all\nright, of course. Why are you crying--you do not think, do you, that Dr.\nZimmern betrayed us?\"\n\nMarguerite raised herself upon her elbow and looked at me with hurt\nsurprise. \"Do you think that?\" she demanded, almost fiercely.\n\n\"By no means,\" I hastened to assure her, \"but I do not understand your\ngrief and I only thought that perhaps when you told him he was\nangered--I never understood why he seemed so anxious not to have you\ngo with me.\"\n\n\"Oh, my dear,\" sobbed Marguerite. \"Of course you never understood,\nbecause we too had a secret that has been kept from you, and you have\nbeen so apologetic because you feared so long to confide in me and I\nhave been even slower to confide in you.\"\n\nFor a moment black rebellion rose in my heart, for though with my\nreasoning I had accepted the explanation that Zimmern had given for his\ninterest in Marguerite, I had never quite accepted it in my unreasoning\nheart. And in the depths of me the battle between love and reason and\nthe dark forces of jealous unreason and suspicion had smouldered, to\nbreak out afresh on the least provocation.\n\nI fought again to conquer these dark forces, for I had many times\nforgiven her even the thing which suspicion charged. And as I struggled\nnow the sound of Marguerite's words came sweeping through my soul like a\ngreat cleansing wind, for she said--\"The secret that I have kept back\nfrom you and that I have wanted so often to tell you is that Dr. Zimmern\nis my father!\"\n\n~7~\n\nIn the early dawn of a foggy morning we beached the _Eitel 3_ on a sandy\nstretch of Danish shore within a few kilometres of an airdome of the\nWorld Patrol. A native fisherman took Grauble, Marguerite and myself in\nhis hydroplane to the post, where we found the commander at his\nbreakfast. He was a man of quick intelligence. Our strange garb was\nsufficient to prove us Germans, while a brief and accurate account of\nthe attempted rescue of the mines of Stassfurt, given in perfect\nEnglish, sufficed to credit my reappearance in the affairs of the free\nworld as a matter of grave and urgent importance.\n\nA squad of men were sent at once to guard the vessel that had been left\nin charge of the mate. Within a few hours we three were at the seat of\nthe World Government at Geneva.\n\nGrauble surrendered his charts of the secret passage and was made a\nformal prisoner of state, until the line of the passage could be\nexplored by borings and the reality of its existence verified.\n\nI was in daily conference with the Council in regard to momentous\nactions that were set speedily a-going. The submarine tunnel was located\nand the passage blocked. A fleet of ice crushers and exploring planes\nwere sent to locate the protium mines of the Arctic. The proclamation of\nthese calamities to the continued isolated existence of Germany and the\nterms of peace and amnesty were sent showering down through the clouds\nto the roof of Berlin.\n\nMarguerite and I had taken up our residence in a cottage on the lake\nshore, and there as I slept late into the sunlit hours of a July\nmorning, I heard the clatter of a telephone annunciator. I sat bolt\nupright listening to the words of the instrument--\n\n\"Berlin has shut off the Ray generators of the defence mines--all over\nthe desert of German soil men are pouring forth from the ventilating\nshafts--the roof of Berlin is a-swarm with a mass of men frolicking in\nthe sunlight--the planes of the World Patrol have alighted on the roof\nand have received and flashed back the news of the abdication of the\nEmperor and the capitulation of Berlin--the world armies of the mines\nare out and marching forth to police the city--\"\n\nThe voice of the instrument ceased.\n\nI looked about for Marguerite and saw her not. I was up and running\nthrough the rooms of the cottage. I reached the outer door and saw her\nin the garden, robed in a gown of gossamer white, her hair streaming\nloose about her shoulders and gleaming golden brown in the quivering\nlight. She was holding out her hands to the East, where o'er the\nfar-flung mountain craigs the God of Day beamed down upon his\nworshipper.\n\nIn a frenzy of wild joy I called to her--\"Babylon is fallen--is fallen!\nThe black spot is erased from the map of the world!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of City of Endless Night, by Milo Hastings\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CITY OF ENDLESS NIGHT ***\n\n***** This file should be named 9862-8.txt or 9862-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/9/8/6/9862/\n\nProduced by Suzanne Shell, Susan Woodring, and Project\nGutenberg Distributed Proofreaders\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
