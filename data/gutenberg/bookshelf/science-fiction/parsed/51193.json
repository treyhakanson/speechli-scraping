Pictures, that is, that one can test and measure.\n       And these pictures positively, absolutely could not lie!\n\n\nThe man from the _News_ asked, \"What do you think of the aliens, Mister\nNathen? Are they friendly? Do they look human?\"\n\n\"Very human,\" said the thin young man.\n\nOutside, rain sleeted across the big windows with a steady faint\ndrumming, blurring and dimming the view of the airfield where _they_\nwould arrive. On the concrete runways, the puddles were pockmarked\nwith rain, and the grass growing untouched between the runways of the\nunused field glistened wetly, bending before gusts of wind.\n\nBack at a respectful distance from where the huge spaceship would\nland were the gray shapes of trucks, where TV camera crews huddled\ninside their mobile units, waiting. Farther back in the deserted sandy\nlandscape, behind distant sandy hills, artillery was ringed in a great\ncircle, and in the distance across the horizon, bombers stood ready at\nairfields, guarding the world against possible treachery from the first\nalien ship ever to land from space.\n\n\"Do you know anything about their home planet?\" asked the man from\n_Herald_.\n\nThe _Times_ man stood with the others, listening absently, thinking of\nquestions, but reserving them. Joseph R. Nathen, the thin young man\nwith the straight black hair and the tired lines on his face, was being\ntreated with respect by his interviewers. He was obviously on edge, and\nthey did not want to harry him with too many questions to answer at\nonce. They wanted to keep his good will. Tomorrow he would be one of\nthe biggest celebrities ever to appear in headlines.\n\n\"No, nothing directly.\"\n\n\"Any ideas or deductions?\" _Herald_ persisted.\n\n\"Their world must be Earth-like to them,\" the weary-looking young man\nanswered uncertainly. \"The environment evolves the animal. But only in\nrelative terms, of course.\" He looked at them with a quick glance and\nthen looked away evasively, his lank black hair beginning to cling to\nhis forehead with sweat. \"That doesn't necessarily mean anything.\"\n\n\"Earth-like,\" muttered a reporter, writing it down as if he had noticed\nnothing more in the reply.\n\nThe _Times_ man glanced at the _Herald_, wondering if he had noticed,\nand received a quick glance in exchange.\n\nThe _Herald_ asked Nathen, \"You think they are dangerous, then?\"\n\nIt was the kind of question, assuming much, which usually broke\nreticence and brought forth quick facts--when it hit the mark. They all\nknew of the military precautions, although they were not supposed to\nknow.\n\nThe question missed. Nathen glanced out the window vaguely. \"No, I\nwouldn't say so.\"\n\n\"You think they are friendly, then?\" said the _Herald_, equally\npositive on the opposite tack.\n\nA fleeting smile touched Nathen's lips. \"Those I know are.\"\n\nThere was no lead in this direction, and they had to get the basic\nfacts of the story before the ship came. The _Times_ asked, \"What led\nup to your contacting them?\"\n\nNathen answered after a hesitation. \"Static. Radio static. The Army\ntold you my job, didn't they?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Army had told them nothing at all. The officer who had conducted\nthem in for the interview stood glowering watchfully, as if he objected\nby instinct to telling anything to the public.\n\nNathen glanced at him doubtfully. \"My job is radio decoder for the\nDepartment of Military Intelligence. I use a directional pickup, tune\nin on foreign bands, record any scrambled or coded messages I hear, and\nbuild automatic decoders and descramblers for all the basic scramble\npatterns.\"\n\nThe officer cleared his throat, but said nothing.\n\nThe reporters smiled, noting that down.\n\nSecurity regulations had changed since arms inspection had been\nlegalized by the U.N. Complete information being the only public\nsecurity against secret rearmament, spying and prying had come to seem\na public service. Its aura had changed. It was good public relations to\nadmit to it.\n\nNathen continued, \"I started directing the pickup at stars in my\nspare time. There's radio noise from stars, you know. Just stuff that\nsounds like spatter static, and an occasional squawk. People have been\nlistening to it for a long time, and researching, trying to work out\nwhy stellar radiation on those bands comes in such jagged bursts. It\ndidn't seem natural.\"\n\nHe paused and smiled uncertainly, aware that the next thing he would\nsay was the thing that would make him famous--an idea that had come to\nhim while he listened--an idea as simple and as perfect as the one that\ncame to Newton when he saw the apple fall.\n\n\"I decided it wasn't natural. I tried decoding it.\"\n\nHurriedly he tried to explain it away and make it seem obvious. \"You\nsee, there's an old intelligence trick, speeding up a message on a\nrecord until it sounds just like that, a short squawk of static, and\nthen broadcasting it. Undergrounds use it. I'd heard that kind of\nscreech before.\"\n\n\"You mean they broadcast at us in code?\" asked the _News_.\n\n\"It's not exactly code. All you need to do is record it and slow it\ndown. They're not broadcasting at us. If a star has planets, inhabited\nplanets, and there is broadcasting between them, they would send it on\na tight beam to save power.\" He looked for comprehension. \"You know,\nlike a spotlight. Theoretically, a tight beam can go on forever without\nlosing power. But aiming would be difficult from planet to planet. You\ncan't expect a beam to stay on target, over such distances, more than a\nfew seconds at a time. So they'd naturally compress each message into\na short half-second or one-second-length package and send it a few\nhundred times in one long blast to make sure it is picked up during\nthe instant the beam swings across the target.\"\n\nHe was talking slowly and carefully, remembering that this explanation\nwas for the newspapers. \"When a stray beam swings through our section\nof space, there's a sharp peak in noise level from that direction.\nThe beams are swinging to follow their own planets at home, and\nthe distance between there and here exaggerates the speed of swing\ntremendously, so we wouldn't pick up more than a bip as it passes.\"\n\n\"How do you account for the number of squawks coming in?\" the _Times_\nasked. \"Do stellar systems rotate on the plane of the Galaxy?\" It was a\nprivate question; he spoke impulsively from interest and excitement.\n\nThe radio decoder grinned, the lines of strain vanishing from his face\nfor a moment. \"Maybe we're intercepting everybody's telephone calls,\nand the whole Galaxy is swarming with races that spend all day yacking\nat each other over the radio. Maybe the human type is standard model.\"\n\n\"It would take something like that,\" the _Times_ agreed. They smiled at\neach other.\n\nThe _News_ asked, \"How did you happen to pick up television instead of\nvoices?\"\n\n\"Not by accident,\" Nathen explained patiently. \"I'd recognized a\nscanning pattern, and I wanted pictures. Pictures are understandable in\nany language.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNear the interviewers, a Senator paced back and forth, muttering\nhis memorized speech of welcome and nervously glancing out the wide\nstreaming windows into the gray sleeting rain.\n\nOpposite the windows of the long room was a small raised platform\nflanked by the tall shapes of TV cameras and sound pickups on booms,\nand darkened floodlights, arranged and ready for the Senator to make\nhis speech of welcome to the aliens and the world. A shabby radio\nsending set stood beside it without a case to conceal its parts, two\ncathode television tubes flickering nakedly on one side and the speaker\nhumming on the other. A vertical panel of dials and knobs jutted up\nbefore them and a small hand-mike sat ready on the table before the\npanel. It was connected to a boxlike, expensively cased piece of\nequipment with \"Radio Lab, U.S. Property\" stenciled on it.\n\n\"I recorded a couple of package screeches from Sagittarius and began\nworking on them,\" Nathen added. \"It took a couple of months to find\nthe synchronizing signals and set the scanners close enough to the\nright time to even get a pattern. When I showed the pattern to the\nDepartment, they gave me full time to work on it, and an assistant to\nhelp. It took eight months to pick out the color bands, and assign them\nthe right colors, to get anything intelligible on the screen.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe shabby-looking mess of exposed parts was the original receiver that\nthey had labored over for ten months, adjusting and readjusting to\nreduce the maddening rippling plaids of unsynchronized color scanners\nto some kind of sane picture.\n\n\"Trial and error,\" said Nathen, \"but it came out all right. The wide\nband-spread of the squawks had suggested color TV from the beginning.\"\n\nHe walked over and touched the set. The speaker bipped slightly and\nthe gray screen flickered with a flash of color at the touch. The set\nwas awake and sensitive, tuned to receive from the great interstellar\nspaceship which now circled the atmosphere.\n\n\"We wondered why there were so many bands, but when we got the set\nworking, and started recording and playing everything that came in, we\nfound we'd tapped something like a lending library line. It was all\nfiction, plays.\"\n\nBetween the pauses in Nathen's voice, the _Times_ found himself\nunconsciously listening for the sound of roaring, swiftly approaching\nrocket jets.\n\nThe _Post_ asked, \"How did you contact the spaceship?\"\n\n\"I scanned and recorded a film copy of _Rite of Spring_, the\nDisney-Stravinsky combination, and sent it back along the same line we\nwere receiving from. Just testing. It wouldn't get there for a good\nnumber of years, if it got there at all, but I thought it would please\nthe library to get a new record in.\n\n\"Two weeks later, when we caught and slowed a new batch of recordings,\nwe found an answer. It was obviously meant for us. It was a flash of\nthe Disney being played to a large audience, and then the audience\nsitting and waiting before a blank screen. The signal was very clear\nand loud. We'd intercepted a spaceship. They were asking for an encore,\nyou see. They liked the film and wanted more....\"\n\nHe smiled at them in sudden thought. \"You can see them for yourself.\nIt's all right down the hall where the linguists are working on the\nautomatic translator.\"\n\nThe listening officer frowned and cleared his throat, and the thin\nyoung man turned to him quickly. \"No security reason why they should\nnot see the broadcasts, is there? Perhaps you should show them.\" He\nsaid to the reporters reassuringly, \"It's right down the hall. You\nwill be informed the moment the spaceship approaches.\"\n\nThe interview was very definitely over. The lank-haired, nervous young\nman turned away and seated himself at the radio set while the officer\nswallowed his objections and showed them dourly down the hall to a\nclosed door.\n\nThey opened it and fumbled into a darkened room crowded with empty\nfolding chairs, dominated by a glowing bright screen. The door closed\nbehind them, bringing total darkness.\n\nThere was the sound of reporters fumbling their way into seats around\nhim, but the _Times_ man remained standing, aware of an enormous\nsurprise, as if he had been asleep and wakened to find himself in the\nwrong country.\n\nThe bright colors of the double image seemed the only real thing in the\ndarkened room. Even blurred as they were, he could see that the action\nwas subtly different, the shapes subtly not right.\n\n_He was looking at aliens._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe impression was of two humans disguised, humans moving oddly,\nhalf-dancing, half-crippled. Carefully, afraid the images would go\naway, he reached up to his breast pocket, took out his polarized\nglasses, rotated one lens at right angles to the other and put them on.\n\nImmediately, the two beings came into sharp focus, real and solid,\nand the screen became a wide, illusively near window through which he\nwatched them.\n\nThey were conversing with each other in a gray-walled room, discussing\nsomething with restrained excitement. The large man in the green tunic\nclosed his purple eyes for an instant at something the other said, and\ngrimaced, making a motion with his fingers as if shoving something away\nfrom him.\n\nMellerdrammer.\n\nThe second, smaller, with yellowish-green eyes, stepped closer, talking\nmore rapidly in a lower voice. The first stood very still, not trying\nto interrupt.\n\nObviously, the proposal was some advantageous treachery, and he wanted\nto be persuaded. The _Times_ groped for a chair and sat down.\n\nPerhaps gesture is universal; desire and aversion, a leaning forward or\na leaning back, tension, relaxation. Perhaps these actors were masters.\nThe scenes changed, a corridor, a parklike place in what he began to\nrealize was a spaceship, a lecture room. There were others talking\nand working, speaking to the man in the green tunic, and never was it\nunclear what was happening or how they felt.\n\nThey talked a flowing language with many short vowels and shifts of\npitch, and they gestured in the heat of talk, their hands moving with\nan odd lagging difference of motion, not slow, but somehow drifting.\n\nHe ignored the language, but after a time the difference in motion\nbegan to arouse his interest. Something in the way they walked....\n\nWith an effort he pulled his mind from the plot and forced his\nattention to the physical difference. Brown hair in short silky crew\ncuts, varied eye colors, the colors showing clearly because their\nirises were very large, their round eyes set very widely apart in\ntapering light-brown faces. Their necks and shoulders were thick in a\nway that would indicate unusual strength for a human, but their wrists\nwere narrow and their fingers long and thin and delicate.\n\nThere seemed to be more than the usual number of fingers.\n\nSince he came in, a machine had been whirring and a voice muttering\nbeside him. He called his attention from counting their fingers and\nlooked around. Beside him sat an alert-looking man wearing earphones,\nwatching and listening with hawklike concentration. Beside him was a\ntall streamlined box. From the screen came the sound of the alien\nlanguage. The man abruptly flipped a switch on the box, muttered a word\ninto a small hand-microphone and flipped the switch back with nervous\nrapidity.\n\nHe reminded the _Times_ man of the earphoned interpreters at the UN.\nThe machine was probably a vocal translator and the mutterer a linguist\nadding to its vocabulary. Near the screen were two other linguists\ntaking notes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe _Times_ remembered the Senator pacing in the observatory room,\nrehearsing his speech of welcome. The speech would not be just\nthe empty pompous gesture he had expected. It would be translated\nmechanically and understood by the aliens.\n\nOn the other side of the glowing window that was the stereo screen, the\nlarge protagonist in the green tunic was speaking to a pilot in a gray\nuniform. They stood in a brightly lit canary-yellow control room in a\nspaceship.\n\nThe _Times_ tried to pick up the thread of the plot. Already he was\ninterested in the fate of the hero, and liked him. That was the effect\nof good acting, probably, for part of the art of acting is to win\naffection from the audience, and this actor might be the matinee idol\nof whole solar systems.\n\nControlled tension, betraying itself by a jerk of the hands, a\ntoo-quick answer to a question. The uniformed one, not suspicious,\nturned his back, busying himself at some task involving a map lit with\nglowing red points, his motions sharing the same fluid dragging grace\nof the others, as if they were underwater, or on a slow motion film.\nThe other was watching a switch, a switch set into a panel, moving\ncloser to it, talking casually--background music coming and rising in\nthin chords of tension.\n\nThere was a closeup of the alien's face watching the switch, and the\n_Times_ noted that his ears were symmetrically half-circles, almost\nperfect with no earholes visible. The voice of the uniformed one\nanswered, a brief word in a preoccupied deep voice. His back was still\nturned. The other glanced at the switch, moving closer to it, talking\ncasually, the switch coming closer and closer stereoscopically. It was\nin reach, filling the screen. His hand came into view, darting out,\nclosed over the switch--\n\nThere was a sharp clap of sound and his hand opened in a frozen\nshape of pain. Beyond him, as his gaze swung up, stood the figure of\nthe uniformed officer, unmoving, a weapon rigid in his hand, in the\nstartled position in which he had turned and fired, watching with\nwidening eyes as the man in the green tunic swayed and fell.\n\nThe tableau held, the uniformed one drooping, looking down at his hand\nholding the weapon which had killed, and music began to build in from\nthe background. Just for an instant, the room and the things within\nit flashed into one of those bewildering color changes which were the\nbane of color television, and switched to a color negative of itself, a\ngreen man standing in a violet control room, looking down at the body\nof a green man in a red tunic. It held for less than a second; then the\ncolor band alternator fell back into phase and the colors reversed to\nnormal.\n\nAnother uniformed man came and took the weapon from the limp hand of\nthe other, who began to explain dejectedly in a low voice while the\nmusic mounted and covered his words and the screen slowly went blank,\nlike a window that slowly filmed over with gray fog.\n\nThe music faded.\n\nIn the dark, someone clapped appreciatively.\n\nThe earphoned man beside the _Times_ shifted his earphones back from\nhis ears and spoke briskly. \"I can't get any more. Either of you want a\nreplay?\"\n\nThere was a short silence until the linguist nearest the set said, \"I\nguess we've squeezed that one dry. Let's run the tape where Nathen and\nthat ship radio boy are kidding around CQing and tuning their beams in\ncloser. I have a hunch the boy is talking routine ham talk and giving\nthe old radio count--one-two-three-testing.\"\n\nThere was some fumbling in the semi-dark and then the screen came to\nlife again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt showed a flash of an audience sitting before a screen and gave a\nclipped chord of some familiar symphony. \"Crazy about Stravinsky and\nMozart,\" remarked the earphoned linguist to the _Times_, resettling his\nearphones. \"Can't stand Gershwin. Can you beat that?\" He turned his\nattention back to the screen as the right sequence came on.\n\nThe _Post_, who was sitting just in front of him, turned to the _Times_\nand said, \"Funny how much they look like people.\" He was writing,\nmaking notes to telephone his report. \"What color hair did that\ncharacter have?\"\n\n\"I didn't notice.\" He wondered if he should remind the reporter that\nNathen had said he assigned the color bands on guess, choosing the\ncolors that gave the most plausible images. The guests, when they\narrived, could turn out to be bright green with blue hair. Only the\ngradations of color in the picture were sure, only the similarities and\ncontrasts, the relationship of one color to another.\n\nFrom the screen came the sound of the alien language again. This race\naveraged deeper voices than human. He liked deep voices. Could he write\nthat?\n\nNo, there was something wrong with that, too. How had Nathen\nestablished the right sound-track pitch? Was it a matter of taking the\nmodulation as it came in, or some sort of hetrodyning up and down by\ntrial and error? Probably.\n\nIt might be safer to assume that Nathen had simply preferred deep\nvoices.\n\nAs he sat there, doubting, an uneasiness he had seen in Nathen came\nback to add to his own uncertainty, and he remembered just how close\nthat uneasiness had come to something that looked like restrained fear.\n\n\"What I don't get is why he went to all the trouble of picking up TV\nshows instead of just contacting them,\" the _News_ complained. \"They're\ngood shows, but what's the point?\"\n\n\"Maybe so we'd get to learn their language too,\" said the _Herald_.\n\nOn the screen now was the obviously unstaged and genuine scene of a\nyoung alien working over a bank of apparatus. He turned and waved and\nopened his mouth in the comical O shape which the _Times_ was beginning\nto recognize as their equivalent of a smile, then went back to trying\nto explain something about the equipment, in elaborate awkward gestures\nand carefully mouthed words.\n\nThe _Times_ got up quietly, went out into the bright white stone\ncorridor and walked back the way he had come, thoughtfully folding his\nstereo glasses and putting them away.\n\nNo one stopped him. Secrecy restrictions were ambiguous here. The\nreticence of the Army seemed more a matter of habit, mere reflex, from\nthe fact that it had all originated in the Intelligence Department,\nthan any reasoned policy of keeping the landing a secret.\n\nThe main room was more crowded than he had left it. The TV camera\nand sound crew stood near their apparatus, the Senator had found a\nchair and was reading, and at the far end of the room eight men were\ngrouped in a circle of chairs, arguing something with impassioned\nconcentration. The _Times_ recognized a few he knew personally, eminent\nnames in science, workers in field theory.\n\nA stray phrase reached him: \"--reference to the universal constants as\nratio--\" It was probably a discussion of ways of converting formulas\nfrom one mathematics to another for a rapid exchange of information.\n\nThey had reason to be intent, aware of the flood of insights that novel\nviewpoints could bring, if they could grasp them. He would have liked\nto go over and listen, but there was too little time left before the\nspaceship was due, and he had a question to ask.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe hand-rigged transceiver was still humming, tuned to the sending\nband of the circling ship, and the young man who had started it all\nwas sitting on the edge of the TV platform with his chin resting in\none hand. He did not look up as the _Times_ approached, but it was the\nindifference of preoccupation, not discourtesy.\n\nThe _Times_ sat down on the edge of the platform beside him and took\nout a pack of cigarettes, then remembered the coming TV broadcast\nand the ban on smoking. He put them away, thoughtfully watching the\ndiminishing rain spray against the streaming windows.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" he asked.\n\nNathen showed that he was aware and friendly by a slight motion of his\nhead.\n\n\"_You_ tell me.\"\n\n\"Hunch,\" said the _Times_ man. \"Sheer hunch. Everything sailing along\ntoo smoothly, everyone taking too much for granted.\"\n\nNathen relaxed slightly. \"I'm still listening.\"\n\n\"Something about the way they move....\"\n\nNathen shifted to glance at him.\n\n\"That's bothered me, too.\"\n\n\"Are you sure they're adjusted to the right speed?\"\n\nNathen clenched his hands out in front of him and looked at them\nconsideringly. \"I don't know. When I turn the tape faster, they're all\nrushing, and you begin to wonder why their clothes don't stream behind\nthem, why the doors close so quickly and yet you can't hear them slam,\nwhy things fall so fast. If I turn it slower, they all seem to be\nswimming.\" He gave the _Times_ a considering sidewise glance. \"Didn't\ncatch the name.\"\n\nCountry-bred guy, thought the _Times_. \"Jacob Luke, _Times_,\" he said,\nextending his hand.\n\nNathen gave the hand a quick, hard grip, identifying the name. \"Sunday\nScience Section editor. I read it. Surprised to meet you here.\"\n\n\"Likewise.\" The _Times_ smiled. \"Look, have you gone into this\nrationally, with formulas?\" He found a pencil in his pocket.\n\"Obviously there's something wrong with our judgment of their\nweight-to-speed-to-momentum ratio. Maybe it's something simple like low\ngravity aboard ship, with magnetic shoes. Maybe they _are_ floating\nslightly.\"\n\n\"Why worry?\" Nathen cut in. \"I don't see any reason to try to figure it\nout now.\" He laughed and shoved back his black hair nervously. \"We'll\nsee them in twenty minutes.\"\n\n\"Will we?\" asked the _Times_ slowly.\n\nThere was a silence while the Senator turned a page of his magazine\nwith a slight crackling of paper, and the scientists argued at the\nother end of the room. Nathen pushed at his lank black hair again, as\nif it were trying to fall forward in front of his eyes and keep him\nfrom seeing.\n\n\"Sure.\" The young man laughed suddenly, talked rapidly. \"Sure we'll\nsee them. Why shouldn't we, with all the government ready with welcome\nspeeches, the whole Army turned out and hiding over the hill, reporters\nall around, newsreel cameras--everything set up to broadcast the\nlanding to the world. The President himself shaking hands with me and\nwaiting in Washington--\"\n\nHe came to the truth without pausing for breath.\n\nHe said, \"Hell, no, they won't get here. There's some mistake\nsomewhere. Something's wrong. I should have told the brasshats\nyesterday when I started adding it up. Don't know why I didn't say\nanything. Scared, I guess. Too much top rank around here. Lost my\nnerve.\"\n\nHe clutched the _Times_ man's sleeve. \"Look. I don't know what--\"\n\nA green light flashed on the sending-receiving set. Nathen didn't look\nat it, but he stopped talking.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe loudspeaker on the set broke into a voice speaking in the alien's\nlanguage. The Senator started and looked nervously at it, straightening\nhis tie. The voice stopped.\n\nNathen turned and looked at the loudspeaker. His worry seemed to be\ngone.\n\n\"What is it?\" the _Times_ asked anxiously.\n\n\"He says they've slowed enough to enter the atmosphere now. They'll be\nhere in five to ten minutes, I guess. That's Bud. He's all excited.\nHe says holy smoke, what a murky-looking planet we live on.\" Nathen\nsmiled. \"Kidding.\"\n\nThe _Times_ was puzzled. \"What does he mean, murky? It can't be\nraining over much territory on Earth.\" Outside, the rain was slowing\nand bright blue patches of sky were shining through breaks in the\ncloud blanket, glittering blue light from the drops that ran down the\nwindows. He tried to think of an explanation. \"Maybe they're trying to\nland on Venus.\" The thought was ridiculous, he knew. The spaceship was\nfollowing Nathen's sending beam. It couldn't miss Earth. \"Bud\" had to\nbe kidding.\n\nThe green light glowed on the set again, and they stopped speaking,\nwaiting for the message to be recorded, slowed and replayed. The\ncathode screen came to life suddenly with a picture of the young man\nsitting at his sending-set, his back turned, watching a screen at one\nside which showed a glimpse of a huge dark plain approaching. As the\nship plunged down toward it, the illusion of solidity melted into a\nboiling turbulence of black clouds. They expanded in an inky swirl,\nlooked huge for an instant, and then blackness swallowed the screen.\nThe young alien swung around to face the camera, speaking a few words\nas he moved, made the O of a smile again, then flipped the switch and\nthe screen went gray.\n\nNathen's voice was suddenly toneless and strained. \"He said something\nlike break out the drinks, here they come.\"\n\n\"The atmosphere doesn't look like that,\" the _Times_ said at random,\nknowing he was saying something too obvious even to think about. \"Not\nEarth's atmosphere.\"\n\nSome people drifted up. \"What did they say?\"\n\n\"Entering the atmosphere, ought to be landing in five or ten minutes,\"\nNathen told them.\n\nA ripple of heightened excitement ran through the room. Cameramen began\nadjusting the lens angles again, turning on the mike and checking it,\nturning on the floodlights. The scientists rose and stood near the\nwindow, still talking. The reporters trooped in from the hall and went\nto the windows to watch for the great event. The three linguists came\nin, trundling a large wheeled box that was the mechanical translator,\nsupervising while it was hitched into the sound broadcasting system.\n\n\"Landing where?\" the _Times_ asked Nathen brutally. \"Why don't you do\nsomething?\"\n\n\"Tell me what to do and I'll do it,\" Nathen said quietly, not moving.\n\nIt was not sarcasm. Jacob Luke of the _Times_ looked sidewise at the\nstrained whiteness of his face, and moderated his tone. \"Can't you\ncontact them?\"\n\n\"Not while they're landing.\"\n\n\"What now?\" The _Times_ took out a pack of cigarettes, remembered the\nrule against smoking, and put it back.\n\n\"We just wait.\" Nathen leaned his elbow on one knee and his chin in his\nhand.\n\nThey waited.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll the people in the room were waiting. There was no more\nconversation. A bald man of the scientist group was automatically\nbuffing his fingernails over and over and inspecting them without\nseeing them, another absently polished his glasses, held them up to\nthe light, put them on, and then a moment later took them off and began\npolishing again. The television crew concentrated on their jobs, moving\nquietly and efficiently, with perfectionist care, minutely arranging\nthings which did not need to be arranged, checking things that had\nalready been checked.\n\nThis was to be one of the great moments of human history, and they were\nall trying to forget that fact and remain impassive and wrapped up in\nthe problems of their jobs as good specialists should.\n\nAfter an interminable age the _Times_ consulted his watch. Three\nminutes had passed. He tried holding his breath a moment, listening for\na distant approaching thunder of jets. There was no sound.\n\nThe sun came out from behind the clouds and lit up the field like a\ngreat spotlight on an empty stage.\n\nAbruptly the green light shone on the set again, indicating that a\nsquawk message had been received. The recorder recorded it, slowed it\nand fed it back to the speaker. It clicked and the sound was very loud\nin the still, tense room.\n\nThe screen remained gray, but Bud's voice spoke a few words in the\nalien language. He stopped, the speaker clicked and the light went out.\nWhen it was plain that nothing more would occur and no announcement was\nto be made of what was said, the people in the room turned back to the\nwindows, talk picked up again.\n\nSomebody told a joke and laughed alone.\n\nOne of the linguists remained turned toward the loudspeaker, then\nlooked at the widening patches of blue sky showing out the window, his\nexpression puzzled. He had understood.\n\n\"It's dark,\" the thin Intelligence Department decoder translated,\nlow-voiced, to the man from the _Times_. \"Your atmosphere is _thick_.\nThat's precisely what Bud said.\"\n\nAnother three minutes. The _Times_ caught himself about to light a\ncigarette and swore silently, blowing the match out and putting the\ncigarette back into its package. He listened for the sound of the\nrocket jets. It was time for the landing, yet he heard no blasts.\n\nThe green light came on in the transceiver.\n\nMessage in.\n\nInstinctively he came to his feet. Nathen abruptly was standing beside\nhim. Then the message came in the voice he was coming to think of as\nBud. It spoke and paused. Suddenly the _Times_ knew.\n\n\"We've landed.\" Nathen whispered the words.\n\nThe wind blew across the open spaces of white concrete and damp soil\nthat was the empty airfield, swaying the wet, shiny grass. The people\nin the room looked out, listening for the roar of jets, looking for the\nsilver bulk of a spaceship in the sky.\n\nNathen moved, seating himself at the transmitter, switching it on to\nwarm up, checking and balancing dials. Jacob Luke of the _Times_ moved\nsoftly to stand behind his right shoulder, hoping he could be useful.\nNathen made a half motion of his head, as if to glance back at him,\nunhooked two of the earphone sets hanging on the side of the tall\nstreamlined box that was the automatic translator, plugged them in and\nhanded one back over his shoulder to the _Times_ man.\n\nThe voice began to come from the speaker again.\n\nHastily, Jacob Luke fitted the earphones over his ears. He fancied he\ncould hear Bud's voice tremble. For a moment it was just Bud's voice\nspeaking the alien language, and then, very distant and clear in his\nearphones, he heard the recorded voice of the linguist say an English\nword, then a mechanical click and another clear word in the voice of\none of the other translators, then another as the alien's voice flowed\nfrom the loudspeaker, the cool single words barely audible, overlapping\nand blending with it like translating thought, skipping unfamiliar\nwords, yet quite astonishingly clear.\n\n\"Radar shows no buildings or civilization near. The atmosphere around\nus registers as thick as glue. Tremendous gas pressure, low gravity,\nno light at all. You didn't describe it like this. Where are you, Joe?\nThis isn't some kind of trick, is it?\" Bud hesitated, was prompted by a\ndeeper official voice and jerked out the words.\n\n\"If it is a trick, we are ready to repel attack.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe linguist stood listening. He whitened slowly and beckoned the other\nlinguists over to him and whispered to them.\n\nJoseph Nathen looked at them with unwarranted bitter hostility while\nhe picked up the hand-mike, plugging it into the translator. \"Joe\ncalling,\" he said quietly into it in clear, slow English. \"No trick. We\ndon't know where you are. I am trying to get a direction fix from your\nsignal. Describe your surroundings to us if at all possible.\"\n\nNearby, the floodlights blazed steadily on the television platform,\nready for the official welcome of the aliens to Earth. The television\nchannels of the world had been alerted to set aside their scheduled\nprograms for an unscheduled great event. In the long room the people\nwaited, listening for the swelling sound of rocket jets.\n\nThis time, after the light came on, there was a long delay. The speaker\nsputtered, and sputtered again, building to a steady scratching they\ncould barely sense as a dim voice. It came through in a few tinny words\nand then wavered back to inaudibility. The machine translated in their\nearphones.\n\n\"Tried ... seemed ... repair....\" Suddenly it came in clearly. \"Can't\ntell if the auxiliary blew, too. Will try it. We might pick you up\nclearly on the next try. I have the volume down. Where is the landing\nport? Repeat. Where is the landing port? Where are you?\"\n\nNathen put down the hand-mike and carefully set a dial on the recording\nbox, and flipped a switch, speaking over his shoulder. \"This sets it to\nrepeat what I said the last time. It keeps repeating.\" Then he sat with\nunnatural stillness, his head still half turned, as if he had suddenly\ncaught a glimpse of answer and was trying with no success whatever to\ngrasp it.\n\nThe green warning light cut in, the recording clicked and the playback\nof Bud's face and voice appeared on the screen.\n\n\"We heard a few words, Joe, and then the receiver blew again. We're\nadjusting a viewing screen to pick up the long waves that go through\nthe murk and convert them to visible light. We'll be able to see\nout soon. The engineer says that something is wrong with the stern\njets, and the captain has had me broadcast a help call to our nearest\nspace base.\" He made the mouth O of a grin. \"The message won't\nreach it for some years. I trust you, Joe, but get us out of here,\nwill you?--They're buzzing that the screen is finally ready. Hold\neverything.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe screen went gray, and the green light went off.\n\nThe _Times_ considered the lag required for the help call, the speaking\nand recording of the message just received, the time needed to\nreconvert a viewing screen.\n\n\"They work fast.\" He shifted uneasily, and added at random, \"Something\nwrong with the time factor. All wrong. They work _too_ fast.\"\n\nThe green light came on again immediately. Nathen half turned to him,\nsliding his words hastily into the gap of time as the message was\nrecorded and slowed. \"They're close enough for our transmission power\nto blow their receiver.\"\n\nIf it was on Earth, why the darkness around the ship? \"Maybe they see\nin the high ultra-violet--the atmosphere is opaque to that band,\" the\n_Times_ suggested hastily as the speaker began to talk in the young\nextraterrestrial's voice.\n\nIt _was_ shaking now. \"Stand by for the description.\"\n\nThey tensed, waiting. The _Times_ brought a map of the state before his\nmind's eye.\n\n\"A half circle of cliffs around the horizon. A wide muddy lake swarming\nwith swimming things. Huge, strange white foliage all around the ship\nand incredibly huge pulpy monsters attacking and eating each other on\nall sides. We almost landed in the lake, right on the soft edge. The\nmud can't hold the ship's weight, and we're sinking. The engineer says\nwe might be able to blast free, but the tubes are mud-clogged and might\nblow up the ship. When can you reach us?\"\n\nThe _Times_ thought vaguely of the Carboniferous Era. Nathen obviously\nhad seen something he had not.\n\n\"Where are they?\" the _Times_ asked him quietly.\n\nNathen pointed to the antenna position indicators. The _Times_ let his\neyes follow the converging imaginary lines of focus out the window to\nthe sunlit airfield, the empty airfield, the drying concrete and green\nwaving grass where the lines met.\n\n_Where the lines met. The spaceship was there!_\n\nThe fear of something unknown gripped him suddenly.\n\nThe spaceship was broadcasting again. \"_Where are you? Answer if\npossible! We are sinking! Where are you?_\"\n\nHe saw that Nathen knew. \"What is it?\" the _Times_ asked hoarsely. \"Are\nthey in another dimension or the past or on another world or what?\"\n\nNathen was smiling bitterly, and Jacob Luke remembered that the young\nman had a friend in that spaceship. \"My guess is that they evolved\non a high-gravity planet, with a thin atmosphere, near a blue-white\nstar. Sure they see in the ultra-violet range. Our sun is abnormally\nsmall and dim and yellow. Our atmosphere is so thick, it screens out\nultra-violet.\" He laughed harshly. \"A good joke on us, the weird place\nwe evolved in, the thing it did to us!\"\n\n\"Where are you?\" called the alien spaceship. \"Hurry, please! We're\nsinking!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe decoder slowed his tumbled, frightened words and looked up into the\n_Times'_ face for understanding. \"We'll rescue them,\" he said quietly.\n\"You were right about the time factor, right about them moving at a\ndifferent speed. I misunderstood. This business about squawk coding,\nspeeding for better transmission to counteract beam waver--I was wrong.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"They don't speed up their broadcasts.\"\n\n\"They don't--?\"\n\nSuddenly, in his mind's eye, the _Times_ began to see again the play\nhe had just seen--but the actors were moving at blurring speed, the\nwords jerking out in a fluting, dizzying stream, thoughts and decisions\npassing with unfollowable rapidity, rippling faces in a twisting blur\nof expressions, doors slamming wildly, shatteringly, as the actors\nleaped in and out of rooms.\n\nNo--faster, faster--he wasn't visualizing it as rapidly as it was,\nan hour of talk and action in one almost instantaneous \"squawk,\" a\nnarrow peak of \"noise\" interfering with a single word in an Earth\nbroadcast! Faster--faster--it was impossible. Matter could not stand\nsuch stress--inertia--momentum--abrupt weight.\n\nIt was insane. \"Why?\" he asked. \"How?\"\n\nNathen laughed again harshly, reaching for the mike. \"Get them out?\nThere isn't a lake or river within hundreds of miles from here!\"\n\nA shiver of unreality went down the _Times'_ spine. Automatically and\ninanely, he found himself delving in his pocket for a cigarette while\nhe tried to grasp what had happened. \"Where are they, then? Why can't\nwe see their spaceship?\"\n\nNathen switched the microphone on in a gesture that showed the\nbitterness of his disappointment.\n\n\"We'll need a magnifying glass for that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Pictures Don't Lie, by Katherine MacLean\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PICTURES DON'T LIE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51193.txt or 51193.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/1/9/51193/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
