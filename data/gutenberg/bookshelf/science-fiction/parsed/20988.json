Cured of his\ninstability by modern psychomedical techniques, he was hired by Arcot to\nhelp build an interplanetary vessel to go to Venus.\n\nThe Venusians proved to be a humanoid race of people who used telepathy\nfor communication. Although they were similar to Earthmen, their blue\nblood and double thumbs made them enough different to have caused\ndistrust and racial friction, had not both planets been drawn together\nin a common bond of defense by the passing of the Black Star.\n\nThe Black Star, Nigra, was a dead, burned-out sun surrounded by a\nplanetary system very much like our own. But these people had been\nforced to use their science to produce enough heat and light to stay\nalive in the cold, black depths of interstellar space. There was nothing\nevil or menacing in their attack on the Solar System; they simply wanted\na star that gave off light and heat. So they attacked, not realizing\nthat they were attacking beings equal in intelligence to themselves.\n\nThey were at another disadvantage, too. The Nigrans had spent long\nmillennia fighting their environment and had had no time to fight among\nthemselves, so they knew nothing of how to wage a war. The Earthmen and\nVenusians knew only too well, since they had a long history of war on\neach planet.\n\nInevitably, the Nigrans were driven back to the Black Star.[A]\n\nThe war was over. And things became dull. And the taste of adventure\nstill remained on the tongues of Arcot, Wade, and Morey.\n\n[Footnote A: See \"_The Black Star Passes_\", Ace Books, F-346.]\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nThree men sat around a table which was littered with graphs, sketches of\nmathematical functions, and books of tensor formulae. Beside the table\nstood a Munson-Bradley integraph calculator which one of the men was\nusing to check some of the equations he had already derived. The results\nthey were getting seemed to indicate something well above and beyond\nwhat they had expected.\n\nAnd anything that surprised the team of Arcot, Wade, and Morey was\nsurprising indeed.\n\nThe intercom buzzed, interrupting their work.\n\nDr. Richard Arcot reached over and lifted the switch. \"Arcot speaking.\"\n\nThe face that flashed on the screen was businesslike and determined.\n\"Dr. Arcot, Mr. Fuller is here. My orders are to check with you on all\nvisitors.\"\n\nArcot nodded. \"Send him up. But from now on, I'm not in to anyone but my\nfather or the Interplanetary Chairman or the elder Mr. Morey. If they\ncome, don't bother to call, just send 'em up. I will not receive calls\nfor the next ten hours. Got it?\"\n\n\"You won't be bothered, Dr. Arcot.\"\n\nArcot cut the circuit and the image collapsed.\n\nLess than two minutes later, a light flashed above the door. Arcot\ntouched the release, and the door slid aside. He looked at the man\nentering and said, with mock coldness:\n\n\"If it isn't the late John Fuller. What did you do--take a plane? It\ntook you an hour to get here from Chicago.\"\n\nFuller shook his head sadly. \"Most of the time was spent in getting past\nyour guards. Getting to the seventy-fourth floor of the Transcontinental\nAirways Building is harder than stealing the Taj Mahal.\" Trying to\nsuppress a grin, Fuller bowed low. \"Besides, I think it would do your\nroyal highness good to be kept waiting for a while. You're paid a couple\nof million a year to putter around in a lab while honest people work for\na living. Then, if you happen to stub your toe over some useful gadget,\nthey increase your pay. They call you scientists and spend the resources\nof two worlds to get you anything you want--and apologize if they don't\nget it within twenty-four hours.\n\n\"No doubt about it; it will do your majesties good to wait.\"\n\nWith a superior smile, he seated himself at the table and shuffled\ncalmly through the sheets of equations before him.\n\nArcot and Wade were laughing, but not Robert Morey. With a sorrowful\nexpression, he walked to the window and looked out at the hundreds of\nslim, graceful aircars that floated above the city.\n\n\"My friends,\" said Morey, almost tearfully, \"I give you the great Dr.\nArcot. These countless machines we see have come from one idea of his.\nJust an idea, mind you! And who worked it into mathematical form and\nmade it calculable, and therefore useful? I did!\n\n\"And who worked out the math for the interplanetary ships? I did!\nWithout me they would never have been built!\" He turned dramatically, as\nthough he were playing King Lear. \"And what do I get for it?\" He pointed\nan accusing finger at Arcot. \"What do I get? _He_ is called 'Earth's\nmost brilliant physicist', and I, who did all the hard work, am referred\nto as 'his mathematical assistant'.\" He shook his head solemnly. \"It's a\nhard world.\"\n\nAt the table, Wade frowned, then looked at the ceiling. \"If you'd make\nyour quotations more accurate, they'd be more trustworthy. The news said\nthat Arcot was the '_System's_ most brilliant physicist', and that you\nwere the 'brilliant mathematical assistant who showed great genius in\ndeveloping the mathematics of Dr. Arcot's new theory'.\" Having delivered\nhis speech, Wade began stoking his pipe.\n\nFuller tapped his fingers on the table. \"Come on, you clowns, knock it\noff and tell me why you called a hard-working man away from his drafting\ntable to come up to this play room of yours. What have you got up your\nsleeve this time?\"\n\n\"Oh, that's too bad,\" said Arcot, leaning back comfortably in his chair.\n\"We're sorry you're so busy. We were thinking of going out to see what\nAntares, Betelguese, or Polaris looked like at close range. And, if we\ndon't get too bored, we might run over to the giant model nebula in\nAndromeda, or one of the others. Tough about your being busy; you might\nhave helped us by designing the ship and earned your board and passage.\nTough.\" Arcot looked at Fuller sadly.\n\nFuller's eyes narrowed. He knew Arcot was kidding, but he also knew how\nfar Arcot would go when he was kidding--and this sounded like he meant\nit. Fuller said: \"Look, teacher, a man named Einstein said that the\nvelocity of light was tops over two hundred years ago, and nobody's come\nup with any counter evidence yet. Has the Lord instituted a new speed\nlaw?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Wade, waving his pipe in a grand gesture of importance.\n\"Arcot just decided he didn't like that law and made a new one himself.\"\n\n\"Now _wait_ a minute!\" said Fuller. \"The velocity of light is a property\nof space!\"\n\nArcot's bantering smile was gone. \"Now you've got it, Fuller. The\nvelocity of light, just as Einstein said, is a property of space. What\nhappens if we change space?\"\n\nFuller blinked. \"Change space? How?\"\n\nArcot pointed toward a glass of water sitting nearby. \"Why do things\nlook distorted through the water? Because the light rays are bent. Why\nare they bent? Because as each wave front moves from air to water, _it\nslows down_. The electromagnetic and gravitational fields between those\natoms are strong enough to increase the curvature of the space between\nthem. Now, what happens if we reverse that effect?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Fuller softly. \"I get it. By changing the curvature of the\nspace surrounding you, you could get any velocity you wanted. But what\nabout acceleration? It would take years to reach those velocities at any\nacceleration a man could stand.\"\n\nArcot shook his head. \"Take a look at the glass of water again. What\nhappens when the light comes _out_ of the water? It speeds up again\n_instantaneously_. By changing the space around a spaceship, you\ninstantaneously change the velocity of the ship to a comparable velocity\nin that space. And since every particle is accelerated at the same rate,\nyou wouldn't feel it, any more than you'd feel the acceleration due to\ngravity in free fall.\"\n\nFuller nodded slowly. Then, suddenly, a light gleamed in his eyes. \"I\nsuppose you've figured out where you're going to get the energy to power\na ship like that?\"\n\n\"He has,\" said Morey. \"Uncle Arcot isn't the type to forget a little\ndetail like that.\"\n\n\"Okay, give,\" said Fuller.\n\nArcot grinned and lit up his own pipe, joining Wade in an attempt to\nfill the room with impenetrable fog.\n\n\"All right,\" Arcot began, \"we needed two things: a tremendous source of\npower and a way to store it.\n\n\"For the first, ordinary atomic energy wouldn't do. It's not\ncontrollable enough and uranium isn't something we could carry by the\nton. So I began working with high-density currents.\n\n\"At the temperature of liquid helium, near absolute zero, lead becomes a\nnearly perfect conductor. Back in nineteen twenty, physicists had\nsucceeded in making a current flow for four hours in a closed circuit.\nIt was just a ring of lead, but the resistance was so low that the\ncurrent kept on flowing. They even managed to get six hundred amperes\nthrough a piece of lead wire no bigger than a pencil lead.\n\n\"I don't know why they didn't go on from there, but they didn't.\nPossibly it was because they didn't have the insulation necessary to\nkeep down the corona effect; in a high-density current, the electrons\ntend to push each other sideways out of the wire.\n\n\"At any rate, I tried it, using _lux_ metal as an insulator around the\nwire.\"\n\n\"Hold it!\" Fuller interrupted. \"What, may I ask, is _lux_ metal?\"\n\n\"That was Wade's idea,\" Arcot grinned. \"You remember those two\nsubstances we found in the Nigran ships during the war?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Fuller. \"One was transparent and the other was a perfect\nreflector. You said they were made of light--photons so greatly\ncondensed that they were held together by their gravitational fields.\"\n\n\"Right. We called them light-metal. But Wade said that was too\nconfusing. With a specific gravity of 103.5, light-metal was certainly\nnot a light metal! So Wade coined a couple of words. _Lux_ is the Latin\nfor light, so he named the transparent one _lux_ and the reflecting one\n_relux_.\"\n\n\"It sounds peculiar,\" Fuller observed, \"but so does every coined word\nwhen you first hear it. Go on with your story.\"\n\nArcot relit his pipe and went on. \"I put a current of ten thousand amps\nthrough a little piece of lead wire, and that gave me a current density\nof 10^{10} amps per square inch.\n\n\"Then I started jacking up the voltage, and modified the thing with a\ndouble-polarity field somewhat similar to the molecular motion field\nexcept that it works on a sub-nucleonic level. As a result, about half\nof the lead fed into the chamber became contraterrene lead! The atoms\njust turned themselves inside out, so to speak, giving us an atom with\npositrons circling a negatively charged nucleus. It even gave the\nneutrons a reverse spin, converting them into anti-neutrons.\n\n\"Result: total annihilation of matter! When the contraterrene lead atoms\nmet the terrene lead atoms, mutual annihilation resulted, giving us pure\nenergy.\n\n\"Some of this power can be bled off to power the mechanism itself; the\nrest is useful energy. We've got all the power we need--power, literally\nby the ton.\"\n\nFuller said nothing; he just looked dazed. He was well beginning to\nbelieve that these three men could do the impossible and do it to order.\n\n\"The second thing,\" Arcot continued, \"was, as I said, a way to store the\nenergy so that it could be released as rapidly or as slowly as we needed\nit.\n\n\"That was Morey's baby. He figured it would be possible to use the\nspace-strain apparatus to store energy. It's an old method; induction\ncoils, condensers, and even gravity itself are storing energy by\nstraining space. But with Morey's apparatus we could store a lot more.\n\n\"A torus-shaped induction coil encloses all its magnetic field within\nit; the torus, or 'doughnut' coil, has a perfectly enclosed magnetic\nfield. We built an enclosed coil, using Morey's principle, and expected\nto store a few watts of power in it to see how long we could hold it.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we made the mistake of connecting it to the city power\nlines, and it cost us a hundred and fifty dollars at a quarter of a cent\nper kilowatt hour. We blew fuses all over the place. After that, we used\nthe relux plate generator.\n\n\"At any rate, the gadget can store power and plenty of it, and it can\nput it out the same way.\"\n\nArcot knocked the ashes out of his pipe and smiled at Fuller. \"Those are\nthe essentials of what we have to offer. We give you the job of figuring\nout the stresses and strains involved. We want a ship with a cruising\nradius of a thousand million light years.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir! Right away, sir! Do you want a gross or only a dozen?\" Fuller\nasked sarcastically. \"You sure believe in big orders! And whence cometh\nthe cold cash for this lovely dream of yours?\"\n\n\"That,\" said Morey darkly, \"is where the trouble comes in. We have to\nconvince Dad. As President of Transcontinental Airways, he's my boss,\nbut the trouble is, he's also my father. When he hears that I want to go\ngallivanting off all over the Universe with you guys, he is very likely\nto turn thumbs down on the whole deal. Besides, Arcot's dad has a lot of\ninfluence around here, too, and I have a healthy hunch he won't like the\nidea, either.\"\n\n\"I rather fear he won't,\" agreed Arcot gloomily.\n\nA silence hung over the room that felt almost as heavy as the pall of\npipe smoke the air conditioners were trying frantically to disperse.\n\nThe elder Mr. Morey had full control of their finances. A ship that\nwould cost easily hundreds of millions of dollars was well beyond\nanything the four men could get by themselves. Their inventions were the\nproperty of Transcontinental, but even if they had not been, not one of\nthe four men would think of selling them to another company.\n\nFinally, Wade said: \"I think we'll stand a much better chance if we show\nthem a big, spectacular exhibition; something really impressive. We'll\npoint out all the advantages and uses of the apparatus. Then we'll show\nthem complete plans for the ship. They might consent.\"\n\n\"They might,\" replied Morey smiling. \"It's worth a try, anyway. And\nlet's get out of the city to do it. We can go up to my place in Vermont.\nWe can use the lab up there for all we need. We've got everything\nworked out, so there's no need to stay here.\n\n\"Besides, I've got a lake up there in which we can indulge in a little\natavism to the fish stage of evolution.\"\n\n\"Good enough,\" Arcot agreed, grinning broadly. \"And we'll need that\nlake, too. Here in the city it's only eighty-five because the aircars\nare soaking up heat for their molecular drive, but out in the country\nit'll be in the nineties.\"\n\n\"To the mountains, then! Let's pack up!\"\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nThe many books and papers they had collected were hastily put into the\nbriefcases, and the four men took the elevator to the landing area on\nthe roof.\n\n\"We'll take my car,\" Morey said. \"The rest of you can just leave yours\nhere. They'll be safe for a few days.\"\n\nThey all piled in as Morey slid into the driver's seat and turned on the\npower.\n\nThey rose slowly, looking below them at the traffic of the great city.\nNew York had long since abandoned her rivers as trade routes; they had\nbeen covered solidly by steel decks which were used as public landing\nfields and ground car routes. Around them loomed titanic structures of\nglistening colored tile. The sunlight reflected brilliantly from them,\nand the contrasting colors of the buildings seemed to blend together\ninto a great, multicolored painting.\n\nThe darting planes, the traffic of commerce down between the great\nbuildings, and the pleasure cars above, combined to give a series of\nchanging, darting shadows that wove a flickering pattern over the city.\nThe long lines of ships coming in from Chicago, London, Buenos Aires\nand San Francisco, and the constant flow from across the Pole--from\nRussia, India, and China, were like mighty black serpents that wound\ntheir way into the city.\n\nMorey cut into a Northbound traffic level, moved into the high-speed\nlane, and eased in on the accelerator. He held to the traffic pattern\nfor two hundred and fifty miles, until he was well past Boston, then he\nturned at the first break and fired the ship toward their goal in\nVermont.\n\nLess than forty-five minutes since they had left New York, Morey was\ndropping the car toward the little mountain lake that offered them a\nplace for seclusion. Gently, he let the ship glide smoothly into the\nshed where the first molecular motion ship had been built. Arcot jumped\nout, saying:\n\n\"We're here--unload and get going. I think a swim and some sleep is in\norder before we start work on this ship. We can begin tomorrow.\" He\nlooked approvingly at the clear blue water of the little lake.\n\nWade climbed out and pushed Arcot to one side. \"All right, out of the\nway, then, little one, and let a man get going.\" He headed for the house\nwith the briefcases.\n\nArcot was six feet two and weighed close to two hundred, but Wade was\nanother two inches taller and weighed a good fifty pounds more. His arms\nand chest were built on the same general plan as those of a gorilla. He\nhad good reason to call Arcot little.\n\nMorey, though still taller, was not as heavily formed, and weighed only\na few pounds more than Arcot, while Fuller was a bit smaller than Arcot.\n\nDue to several factors, the size of the average human being had been\nsteadily increasing for several centuries. Only Wade would have been\nconsidered a \"big\" man by the average person, for the average man was\nover six feet tall.\n\nThey relaxed most of the afternoon, swimming and indulging in a few\nwrestling matches. At wrestling, Wade consistently proved himself not\nonly built like a gorilla but muscled like one; but Arcot proved that\nskill was not without merit several times, for he had found that if he\ncould make the match last more than two minutes, Wade's huge muscles\nwould find an insufficient oxygen supply and tire quickly.\n\nThat evening, after dinner, Morey engaged Wade in a fierce battle of\nchess, with Fuller as an interested spectator. Arcot, too, was watching,\nbut he was saying nothing.\n\nAfter several minutes of uneventful play, Morey stopped suddenly and\nglared at the board. \"Now why'd I make that move? I intended to move my\nqueen over there to check your king on the red diagonal.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" replied Wade gloomily, \"that's what I wanted you to do. I had a\nsure checkmate in three moves.\"\n\nArcot smiled quietly.\n\nThey continued play for several moves, then it was Wade who remarked\nthat something seemed to be influencing his play.\n\n\"I had intended to trade queens. I'm glad I didn't, though; I think this\nleaves me in a better position.\"\n\n\"It sure does,\" agreed Morey. \"I was due to clean up on the queen trade.\nYou surprised me, too; you usually go in for trades. I'm afraid my\nposition is hopeless now.\"\n\nIt was. In the next ten moves, Wade spotted the weak points in every\nattack Morey made; the attack crumbled disastrously and white was forced\nto resign, his king in a hopeless position.\n\nWade rubbed his chin. \"You know, Morey, I seemed to know exactly why you\nmade every move, and I saw every possibility involved.\"\n\n\"Yeah--so I noticed,\" said Morey with a grin.\n\n\"Come on, Morey, let's try a game,\" said Fuller, sliding into the chair\nWade had vacated.\n\nAlthough ordinarily equally matched with Fuller, Morey again went down\nto disastrous defeat in an amazingly short time. It almost seemed as if\nFuller could anticipate every move.\n\n\"Brother, am I off form today,\" he said, rising from the table. \"Come\non, Arcot--let's see you try Wade.\"\n\nArcot sat down, and although he had never played chess as extensively as\nthe others, he proceeded to clean Wade out lock, stock, and barrel.\n\n\"Now what's come over you?\" asked Morey in astonishment as he saw a very\ncomplicated formation working out, a formation he knew was far better\nthan Arcot's usual game. He had just worked it out and felt very proud\nof it.\n\nArcot looked at him and smiled. \"That's the answer, Morey!\"\n\nMorey blinked. \"What--what's the answer to what?\"\n\n\"Yes--I meant it--don't be so surprised--you've seen it done before. I\nhave--no, not under him, but a more experienced teacher. I figured it\nwould come in handy in our explorations.\"\n\nMorey's face grew more and more astonished as Arcot's strange monologue\ncontinued.\n\nFinally, Arcot turned to Wade, who was looking at him and Morey in\nwide-eyed wonder. And this time, it was Wade who began talking in a\nmonologue.\n\n\"You _did_?\" he said in a surprised voice. \"When?\" There was a long\npause, during which Arcot stared at Wade with such intensity that Fuller\nbegan to understand what was happening.\n\n\"Well,\" said Wade, \"if you've learned the trick so thoroughly, try it\nout. Let's see you project your thoughts! Go ahead!\"\n\nFuller, now understanding fully what was going on, burst out laughing.\n\"He _has_ been projecting his thoughts! He hasn't said a word to you!\"\nThen he looked at Arcot. \"As a matter of fact, you've said so little\nthat I don't know how you pulled this telepathic stunt--though I'm quite\nconvinced that you did.\"\n\n\"I spent three months on Venus a while back,\" said Arcot, \"studying with\none of their foremost telepathists. Actually, most of that time was\nspent on theory; learning how to do it isn't a difficult proposition. It\njust takes practice.\n\n\"The whole secret is that everyone has the power; it's a very ancient\npower in the human brain, and most of the lower animals possess it to a\ngreater degree than do humans. When Man developed language, it gave his\nthoughts more concreteness and permitted a freer and more clearly\nconceived type of thinking. The result was that telepathy fell into\ndisuse.\n\n\"I'm going to show you how to do it because it will be invaluable if we\nmeet a strange race. By projecting pictures and concepts, you can\ndispense with going to the trouble of learning the language.\n\n\"After you learn the basics, all you'll need is practice, but watch\nyourself! Too much practice can give you the great-granddaddy of all\nheadaches! Okay, now to begin with ...\"\n\nArcot spent the rest of the evening teaching them the Venerian system of\ntelepathy.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey all rose at nine. Arcot got up first, and the others found it\nexpedient to follow his example shortly thereafter. He had brought a\nlarge Tesla coil into the bedroom from the lab and succeeded in inducing\nsufficient voltage in the bedsprings to make very effective, though\nharmless, sparks.\n\n\"Come on, boys, hit the deck! Wade, as chief chemist, you are to\nsynthesize a little coffee and heat-treat a few eggs for us. We have\nwork ahead today! Rise and shine!\" He didn't shut off the coil until he\nwas assured that each of them had gotten a considerable distance from\nhis bed.\n\n\"Ouch!\" yelled Morey. \"Okay! Shut it off! I want to get my pants! We're\nall up! You win!\"\n\nAfter breakfast, they all went into the room they used as a calculating\nroom. Here they had two different types of integraph calculators and\nplenty of paper and equipment to do their own calculations and draw\ngraphs.\n\n\"To begin with,\" said Fuller, \"let's decide what shape we want to use.\nAs designer, I'd like to point out that a sphere is the strongest, a\ncube easiest to build, and a torpedo shape the most efficient\naerodynamically. However, we intend to use it in space, not air.\n\n\"And remember, we'll need it more as a home than as a ship during the\ngreater part of the trip.\"\n\n\"We might need an aerodynamically stable hull,\" Wade interjected. \"It\ncame in mighty handy on Venus. They're darned useful in emergencies.\nWhat do you think, Arcot?\"\n\n\"I favor the torpedo shape. Okay, now we've got a hull. How about some\nengines to run it? Let's get those, too. I'll name the general things\nfirst; facts and figures can come later.\n\n\"First: We must have a powerful mass-energy converter. We could use the\ncavity radiator and use cosmic rays to warm it, and drive the individual\npower units that way, or we can have a main electrical power unit and\nwarm them all electrically. Now, which one would be the better?\"\n\nMorey frowned. \"I think we'd be safer if we didn't depend on any one\nplant, but had each as separate as possible. I'm for the individual\ncavity radiators.\"\n\n\"Question,\" interjected Fuller. \"How do these cavity radiators work?\"\n\n\"They're built like a thermos bottle,\" Arcot explained. \"The inner shell\nwill be of rough relux, which will absorb the heat efficiently, while\nthe outer one will be of polished relux to keep the radiation inside.\nBetween the two we'll run a flow of helium at two tons per square inch\npressure to carry the heat to the molecular motion apparatus. The neck\nof the bottle will contain the atomic generator.\"\n\nFuller still looked puzzled. \"See here; with this new space strain\ndrive, why do we have to have the molecular drive at all?\"\n\n\"To move around near a heavy mass--in the presence of a strong\ngravitational field,\" Arcot said. \"A gravitational field tends to warp\nspace in such a way that the velocity of light is lower in its presence.\nOur drive tries to warp or strain space in the opposite manner. The two\nwould simply cancel each other out and we'd waste a lot of power going\nnowhere. As a matter of fact, the gravitational field of the sun is so\nintense that we'll have to go out beyond the orbit of Pluto before we\ncan use the space strain drive effectively.\"\n\n\"I catch,\" said Fuller. \"Now to get back to the generators. I think the\npower units would be simpler if they were controlled from one electrical\npower source, and just as reliable. Anyway, the molecular motion power\nis controlled, of necessity, from a single generator, so if one is apt\nto go bad, the other is, too.\"\n\n\"Very good reasoning,\" smiled Morey, \"but I'm still strong for\ndecentralization. I suggest a compromise. We can have the main power\nunit and the main verticals, which will be the largest, controlled by\nindividual cosmic ray heaters, and the rest run by electric power units.\nThey'd be just heating coils surrounded by the field.\"\n\n\"A good idea,\" said Arcot. \"I'm in favor of the compromise. Okay,\nFuller? Okay. Now the next problem is weapons. I suggest we use a\nseparate control panel and a separate generating panel for the power\ntubes we'll want in the molecular beam projectors.\"\n\nThe molecular beam projector simply projected the field that caused\nmolecular motion to take place as wanted. As weapons, they were\nterrifically deadly. If half a mountain is suddenly thrown into the air\nbecause all the random motion of its molecules becomes concentrated in\none direction, it becomes a difficult projectile to fight. Or touch the\nbow of a ship with the beam; the bow drops to absolute zero and is\ndriven back on the stern, with all the speed of its billions of\nmolecules. The general effect is similar to that produced by two ships\nhaving a head-on collision at ten miles per second.\n\nAnything touched by the beam is broken by its own molecules, twisted by\nits own strength, and crushed by its own toughness. Nothing can resist\nit.\n\n\"My idea,\" Arcot went on, \"was that since the same power is used for\nboth the beams and the drive, we'll have two separate power-tube banks\nto generate it. That way, if one breaks down, we can switch to the\nother. We can even use both at once on the drive, if necessary; the\nmolecular motion machines will stand it if we make them of relux and\nanchor them with lux metal beams. The projectors would be able to handle\nthe power, too, using Dad's new system.\n\n\"That will give us more protection, and, at the same time, full power.\nSince we'll have several projectors, the power needed to operate the\nship will be about equal to the power required to operate the\nprojectors.\n\n\"And I also suggest we mount some heat beam projectors.\"\n\n\"Why?\" objected Wade. \"They're less effective than the molecular rays.\nThe molecular beams are instantly irresistible, while the heat beams\ntake time to heat up the target. Sure, they're unhealthy to deal with,\nbut no more so than the molecular beam.\"\n\n\"True enough,\" Arcot agreed, \"but the heat beam is more spectacular, and\nwe may find that a mere spectacular display will accomplish as much as\nactual destruction. Besides, the heat beams are more local in effect. If\nwe want to kill an enemy and spare his captive, we want a beam that will\nbe deadly where it hits, not for fifty yards around.\"\n\n\"Hold it a second,\" said Fuller wearily. \"Now it's heat beams. Don't you\nguys think you ought to explain a little bit to the poor goon who's\ndesigning this flying battlewagon? How did you get a heat beam?\"\n\nArcot grinned. \"Simple. We use a small atomic cavity radiator at one end\nof which is a rough relux parabolic filter. Beyond that is a lux metal\nlens. The relux heats up tremendously, and since there is no polished\nrelux to reflect it back, the heat is radiated out through the lux metal\nlens as a powerful heat beam.\"\n\n\"Okay, fine,\" said Fuller. \"But stop springing new gadgets on me, will\nyou?\"\n\n\"I'll try not to,\" Arcot laughed. \"Anyway, let's get on to the main\npower plant. Remember that our condenser coil is a gadget for storing\nenergy in space; we are therefore obliged to supply it with energy to\nstore. Just forming the drive field alone will require two times ten to\nthe twenty-seventh ergs, or the energy of about _two and a half tons_\nof matter. That means a whale of a lot of lead wire will have to be fed\ninto our conversion generators; it would take several hours to charge\nthe coils. We'd better have two big chargers to do the job.\n\n\"The controls we can figure out later. How about it? Any suggestions?\"\n\n\"Sounds okay to me,\" said Morey, and the others agreed.\n\n\"Good enough. Now, as far as air and water go, we can use the standard\nspacecraft apparatus, Fuller, so you can figure that in any way you want\nto.\"\n\n\"We'll need a lab, too,\" Wade put in. \"And a machine shop with plenty of\nspare parts--everything we can possibly think of. Remember, we may want\nto build some things out in space.\"\n\n\"Right. And I wonder--\" Arcot looked thoughtful. \"How about the\ninvisibility apparatus? It may prove useful, and it won't cost much.\nLet's put that in, too.\"\n\nThe apparatus he mentioned was simply a high-frequency oscillator tube\nof extreme power which caused vibrations approaching light frequency to\nbe set up in the molecules of the ship. As a result, the ship became\ntransparent, since light could easily pass through the vibrating\nmolecules.\n\nThere was only one difficulty; the ship was invisible, all right, but it\nbecame a radio sender and could easily be detected by a directional\nradio. However, if the secret were unknown, it was a very effective\nmethod of disappearing. And, since the frequency was so high, a special\ndetector was required to pick it up.\n\n\"Is that all you need?\" asked Fuller.\n\n\"Nope,\" said Arcot, leaning back in his chair. \"Now comes the kicker. I\nsuggest that we make the hull of foot-thick lux metal and line it on the\ninside with relux wherever we want it to be opaque. And we want relux\nshutters on the windows. Lux is too doggone transparent; if we came too\nclose to a hot star, we'd be badly burned.\"\n\nFuller looked almost goggle-eyed. \"_A--foot--of--lux!_ Good Lord,\nArcot! This ship would weigh a quarter of a million tons! That stuff is\n_dense_!\"\n\n\"Sure,\" agreed Arcot, \"but we'll need the protection. With a ship like\nthat, you could run through a planetoid without hurting the hull. We'll\nmake the relux inner wall about an inch thick, with a vacuum between\nthem for protection in a warm atmosphere. And if some tremendous force\ndid manage to crack the outer wall, we wouldn't be left without\nprotection.\"\n\n\"Okay, you're the boss,\" Fuller said resignedly. \"It's going to have to\nbe a big ship, though. I figure a length of about two hundred feet and a\ndiameter of around thirty feet. The interior I'll furnish with aluminum;\nit'll be cheaper and lighter. How about an observatory?\"\n\n\"Put it in the rear of the ship,\" Wade suggested. \"We'll mount one of\nthe Nigran telectroscopes.\"\n\n\"Control room in the bow, of course,\" Morey chipped in.\n\n\"I've got you,\" Fuller said. \"I'll work the thing out and give you a\ncost estimate and drawings.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" said Arcot, standing up. \"Meanwhile, the rest of us will work\nout our little exhibition to impress Mr. Morey and Dad. Come on, lads,\nlet's get back to the lab.\"\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nIt was two weeks before Dr. Robert Arcot and his old friend Arthur\nMorey, president of Transcontinental Airways, were invited to see what\ntheir sons had been working on.\n\nThe demonstration was to take place in the radiation labs in the\nbasements of the Transcontinental building. Arcot, Wade, Morey, and\nFuller had brought the equipment in from the country place in Vermont\nand set it up in one of the heavily-lined, vault-like chambers that were\nused for radiation experiments.\n\nThe two older men were seated before a huge eighty-inch\nthree-dimensional television screen several floors above the level where\nthe actual demonstration was going on.\n\n\"There can't be anyone in the room, because of radiation burns,\"\nexplained Arcot, junior. \"We could have surrounded the thing with relux,\nbut then you couldn't have seen what's going on.\n\n\"I'm not going to explain anything beforehand; like magic, they'll be\nmore astounding before the explanation is given.\"\n\nHe touched a switch. The cameras began to operate, and the screen sprang\ninto life.\n\nThe screen showed a heavy table on which was mounted a small projector\nthat looked something like a searchlight with several heavy cables\nrunning into it. In the path of the projector was a large lux metal\ncrucible surrounded by a ring of relux, and a series of points of relux\naimed into the crucible. These points and the ring were grounded. Inside\nthe crucible was a small ingot of coronium, the strong, hard, Venerian\nmetal which melted at twenty-five hundred degrees centigrade and boiled\nat better than four thousand. The crucible was entirely enclosed in a\nlarge lux metal case which was lined, on the side away from the\nprojector, with roughened relux.\n\nArcot moved a switch on the control panel. Far below them, a heavy relay\nslammed home, and suddenly a solid beam of brilliant bluish light shot\nout from the projector, a beam so brilliant that the entire screen was\nlit by the intense glow, and the spectators thought that they could\nalmost feel the heat.\n\nIt passed through the lux metal case and through the coronium bar, only\nto be cut off by the relux liner, which, since it was rough, absorbed\nover ninety-nine percent of the rays that struck it.\n\nThe coronium bar glowed red, orange, yellow, and white in quick\nsuccession, then suddenly slumped into a molten mass in the bottom of\nthe crucible.\n\nThe crucible was filled now with a mass of molten metal that glowed\nintensely white and seethed furiously. The slowly rising vapors told of\nthe rapid boiling, and their settling showed that their temperature was\ntoo high to permit them to remain hot--the heat radiated away too fast.\n\nFor perhaps ten seconds this went on, then suddenly a new factor was\nadded to the performance. There was a sudden crashing arc and a blaze of\nblue flame that swept in a cyclonic twisting motion inside the crucible.\nThe blaze of the arc, the intense brilliance of the incandescent metal,\nand the weird light of the beam of radiation shifted in a fantastic play\nof colors. It made a strange and impressive scene.\n\nSuddenly the relay sounded again; the beam of radiance disappeared as\nquickly as it had come. In an instant, the blue violet glare of the\nrelux plate had subsided to an angry red. The violent arcing had\nstopped, and the metal was cooling rapidly. A heavy purplish vapor in\nthe crucible condensed on the walls into black, flakey crystals.\n\nThe elder Arcot was watching the scene in the screen curiously. \"I\nwonder--\" he said slowly. \"As a physicist, I should say it was\nimpossible, but if it did happen, I should imagine these would be the\nresults.\" He turned to look at Arcot junior. \"Well, go on with your\nexhibition, son.\"\n\n\"I want to know your ideas when we're through, though, Dad,\" said the\nyounger man. \"The next on the program is a little more interesting,\nperhaps. At least it demonstrates a more commercial aspect of the\nthing.\"\n\nThe younger Morey was operating the controls of the handling robots. On\nthe screen, a machine rolled in on caterpillar treads, picked up the lux\ncase and its contents, and carried them off.\n\nA minute later, it reappeared with a large electromagnet and a relux\nplate, to which were attached a huge pair of silver busbars. The relux\nplate was set in a stand directly in front of the projector, and the\nbig electromagnet was set up directly behind the relux plate. The magnet\nleads were connected, and a coil, in the form of two toruses\nintersecting at right angles enclosed in a form-fitting relux case, had\nbeen connected to the heavy terminals of the relux plate. An ammeter and\na heavy coil of coronium wire were connected in series with the coil,\nand a kilovoltmeter was connected across the terminals of the relux\nplate.\n\nAs soon as the connections were completed, the robot backed swiftly out\nof the room, and Arcot turned on the magnet and the ray projector.\nInstantly, there was a sharp deflection of the kilovoltmeter.\n\n\"I haven't yet closed the switch leading into the coil,\" he explained,\n\"so there's no current.\" The ammeter needle hadn't moved.\n\nDespite the fact that the voltmeter seemed to be shorted out by the\nrelux plate, the needle pointed steadily at twenty-two. Arcot changed\nthe current through the magnet, and the reading dropped to twenty.\n\nThe rays had been on at very low power, the air only slightly ionized,\nbut as Arcot turned a rheostat, the intensity increased, and the air in\nthe path of the beam shone with an intense blue. The relux plate,\nsubject now to eddy currents, since there was no other path for the\nenergy to take, began to heat up rapidly.\n\n\"I'm going to close the switch into the coil now,\" said Arcot. \"Watch\nthe meters.\"\n\nA relay snapped, and instantly the ammeter jumped to read 4500 amperes.\nThe voltmeter gave a slight kick, then remained steady. The heavy\ncoronium spring grew warm and began to glow dully, while the ammeter\ndropped slightly because of the increased resistance. The relux plate\ncooled slightly, and the voltmeter remained steady.\n\n\"The coil you see is storing the energy that is flowing into it,\" Arcot\nexplained. \"Notice that the coronium resistor is increasing its\nresistance, but otherwise there is little increase in the back E.M.F.\nThe energy is coming from the rays which strike the polarized relux\nplate to give the current.\"\n\nHe paused a moment to make slight adjustments in the controls, then\nturned his attention back to the screen.\n\nThe kilovoltmeter still read twenty.\n\n\"Forty-five hundred amperes at twenty thousand volts,\" the elder Arcot\nsaid softly. \"Where is it going?\"\n\n\"Take a look at the space within the right angle of the torus coils,\"\nsaid Arcot junior. \"It's getting dark in there despite the powerful\nlight shed by the ionized air.\"\n\nIndeed, the space within the twin coils was rapidly growing dark; it was\ndarkening the image of the things behind it, oddly blurring their\noutlines. In a moment, the images were completely wiped out, and the\nregion within the coils was filled with a strangely solid blackness.\n\n\"According to the instruments,\" young Arcot said, \"we have stored\nfifteen thousand kilowatt hours of energy in that coil and there seems\nto be no limit to how much power we can get into it. Just from the power\nit contains, that coil is worth about forty dollars right now, figured\nat a quarter of a cent per kilowatt hour.\n\n\"I haven't been using anywhere near the power I can get out of this\napparatus, either. Watch.\" He threw another switch which shorted around\nthe coronium resistor and the ammeter, allowing the current to run into\nthe coil directly from the plate.\n\n\"I don't have a direct reading on this,\" he explained, \"but an indirect\nreading from the magnetic field in that room shows a current of nearly a\n_hundred million amperes!_\"\n\nThe younger Morey had been watching a panel of meters on the other side\nof the screen. Suddenly, he shouted: \"Cut it, Arcot! The conductors are\nsetting up a secondary field in the plate and causing trouble.\"\n\nInstantly, Arcot's hand went to a switch. A relay slammed open, and the\nray projector died.\n\nThe power coil still held its field of enigmatic blackness.\n\n\"Watch this,\" Arcot instructed. Under his expert manipulation, a small\nrobot handler rolled into the room. It had a pair of pliers clutched in\none claw. The spectators watched the screen in fascination as the robot\ndrew back its arm and hurled the pliers at the black field with all its\nmight. The pliers struck the blackness and rebounded as if they had hit\na rubber wall. Arcot caused the little machine to pick up the pliers and\nrepeat the process.\n\nArcot grinned. \"I've cut off the power to the coil. Unlike the ordinary\ninduction coil, it isn't necessary to keep supplying power to the thing;\nit's a static condition.\n\n\"You can see for yourself how much energy it holds. It's a handy little\ngadget, isn't it?\" He shut off the rest of the instruments and the\ntelevision screen, then turned to his father.\n\n\"The demonstration is over. Got any theories, Dad?\"\n\nThe elder Dr. Arcot frowned in thought. \"The only thing I can think of\nthat would produce an effect like that is a stream of positrons--or\ncontraterrene nuclei. That would explain not only the heating, but the\nelectrical display.\n\n\"As far as the coil goes, that's easy to understand. Any energy storage\ndevice stores energy in the strain in space; here you can actually see\nthe strain in space.\" Then he smiled at his son. \"I see my ex-laboratory\nassistant has come a long way. You've achieved controlled, usable atomic\nenergy through total annihilation of mass. Right?\"\n\nArcot smiled back and nodded. \"Right, Dad.\"\n\n\"Son, I wonder if you'd give me your data sheets on that process. I'd\nlike to work out some of the mathematical problems involved.\"\n\n\"Sure, Dad. But right now--\" Arcot turned toward the elder Mr. Morey.\n\"--I'm more interested in the mathematics of finance. We have a\nproposition to put to you, Mr. Morey, and that proposition, simply\nstated, is--\"\n\nPerhaps it was simply stated, but it took fully an hour for Arcot, Wade,\nand Morey to discuss the science of it with the two older men, and\nFuller spent another hour over the carefully drawn plans for the ship.\n\nAt last, the elder Mr. Morey settled back and looked vacantly at the\nceiling. They were seated now in the conference room of Transcontinental\nAirways.\n\n\"Well, boys,\" said Mr. Morey, \"as usual, I'm in a position where I'm\nforced to yield. I might refuse financial backing, but you could sell\nany one of those gadgets for close to a billion dollars and finance the\nexpedition independently, or you could, with your names, request the\nmoney publicly and back it that way.\" He paused a moment. \"I am,\nhowever, thinking more in terms of your safety than in terms of money.\"\nThere was another long pause, then he smiled at the four younger men.\n\n\"I think, however, that we can trust you. Armed with cosmic and\nmolecular rays, you should be able to put up a fair scrap anywhere.\nAlso, I have never detected any signs of feeblemindedness in any of you;\nI don't think you'll get yourselves in a jam you can't get out of. I'll\nback you.\"\n\n\"I hate to interrupt your exuberance,\" said the elder Dr. Arcot, \"but I\nshould like to know the name of this remarkable ship.\"\n\n\"What?\" asked Wade. \"Name? Oh, it hasn't any.\"\n\nThe elder Morey shook his head sadly. \"That is indeed an important\noversight. If a crew of men can overlook so fundamental a thing, I\nwonder if they _are_ to be trusted.\"\n\n\"Well, what are we going to call it, then?\" asked Arcot.\n\n\"_Solarite II_ might do,\" suggested Morey. \"It will still be from the\nSolar System.\"\n\n\"I think we should be more broadminded,\" said Arcot. \"We aren't going to\nstay in this system--not even in this galaxy. We might call it the\n_Galaxian_.\"\n\n\"Did you say broadminded?\" asked Wade. \"Let's really be broad and call\nit the _Universite_ or something like that. Or, better yet, call it\n_Fluorine!_ That's everywhere in the universe and the most active\nelement there is. This ship will go everywhere in the universe and be\nthe most active thing that ever existed!\"\n\n\"A good name!\" said the elder Morey. \"That gets my vote!\"\n\nYoung Arcot looked thoughtful. \"That's mighty good--I like the\nidea--but it lacks ring.\" He paused, then, looking up at the ceiling,\nrepeated slowly:\n\n\n  _\"Alone, alone, all, all alone;\n    Alone on a wide, wide sea;\n    Nor any saint took pity on\n    My soul in agony.\"_\n\n\nHe rose and walked over to the window, looking out where the bright\npoints of light that were the stars of space rode high in the deep\nviolet of the moonlit sky.\n\n\"The sea of all space--the sea of vastness that lies between the\nfar-flung nebulae--the mighty void--alone on a sea, the vastness of\nwhich no man can imagine--alone--alone where no other man has been;\nalone, so far from all matter, from all mankind, that not even light,\nracing at billions of miles each day, could reach home in less than a\nmillion years.\" Arcot stopped and stood looking out of the window.\n\nMorey broke the silence. \"_The Ancient Mariner._\" He paused. \"'Alone'\nwill certainly be right. I think that name takes all the prizes.\"\n\nFuller nodded slowly. \"I certainly agree. _The Ancient Mariner._ It's\nkind of long, but it is _the_ name.\"\n\nIt was adopted unanimously.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nThe _Ancient Mariner_ was built in the big Transcontinental shops in\nNewark; the power they needed was not available in the smaller shops.\n\nWorking twenty-four hours a day, in three shifts, skilled men took two\nmonths to finish the hull according to Fuller's specifications. The huge\nwalls of lux metal required great care in construction, for they could\nnot be welded; they had to be formed in position. And they could only be\npolished under powerful magnets, where the dense magnetic field softened\nthe lux metal enough to allow a diamond polisher to do the job.\n\nWhen the hull was finished, there came the laborious work of installing\nthe power plant and the tremendous power leads, the connectors, the\ncircuits to the relays--a thousand complex circuits.\n\nMuch of it was standard: the molecular power tubes, the molecular ray\nprojectors, the power tubes for the invisibility apparatus, and many\nother parts. All the relays were standard, the gyroscopic stabilizers\nwere standard, and the electromagnetic braking equipment for the gyros\nwas standard.\n\nBut there would be long days of work ahead for Arcot, Wade, and Morey,\nfor only they could install the special equipment; only they could put\nin the complicated wiring, for no one else on Earth understood the\ncircuits they had to establish.\n\nDuring the weeks of waiting, Arcot and his friends worked on auxiliary\ndevices to be used with the ship. They wanted to make some improvements\non the old molecular ray pistols, and to develop atomic powered heat\nprojectors for hand use. The primary power they stored in small\nspace-strain coils in the handgrip of the pistol. Despite their small\nsize, the coils were capable of storing power for thirty hours of\ncontinuous operation of the rays. The finished weapon was scarcely\nlarger than a standard molecular ray pistol.\n\nArcot pointed out that many of the planets they might visit would be\nlarger than Earth, and they lacked any way of getting about readily\nunder high gravity. Since something had to be done about that, Arcot did\nit. He demonstrated it to his friends one day in the shop yard.\n\nMorey and Wade had just been in to see Fuller about some details of the\nship, and as they came out, Arcot called them over to his work bench. He\nwas wearing a space suit without the helmet.\n\nThe modern space suit is made of woven lux metal wires of extremely\nsmall diameter and airproofed with a rubberoid fluorocarbon plastic, and\nfurnished with air and heating units. Made as it was, it offered\nprotection nothing else could offer; it was almost a perfect insulator\nand was resistant to the attack of any chemical reagent. Not even\nelemental fluorine could corrode it. And the extreme strength of the lux\nmetal fiber made it stronger, pound for pound, than steel or coronium.\n\nOn Arcot's back was a pack of relux plated metal. It was connected by\nrelux web belts to a broad belt that circled Arcot's waist. One thin\ncable ran down the right arm to a small relux tube about eight inches\nlong by two inches in diameter.\n\n\"Watch!\" Arcot said, grinning.\n\nHe reached to his belt and flipped a little switch.\n\n\"So long! See you later!\" He pointed his right arm toward the ceiling\nand sailed lightly into the air. He lowered the angle of his arm and\nmoved smoothly across the huge hangar, floating toward the shining bulk\nof the rapidly forming _Ancient Mariner_. He circled the room, rising\nand sinking at will, then headed for the open door.\n\n\"Come out and watch me where there's more room,\" he called.\n\nOut in the open, he darted high up into the air until he was a mere\nspeck in the sky. Then he suddenly came dropping down and landed lightly\nbefore them, swaying on his feet and poised lightly on his toes.\n\n\"Some jump,\" said Morey, in mock surprise.\n\n\"Yeah,\" agreed Fuller. \"Try again.\"\n\n\"Or,\" Wade put in, \"give me that weight annihilator and I'll beat you at\nyour own game. What's the secret?\"\n\n\"That's a cute gadget. How much load does it carry?\" asked Morey, more\npractically.\n\n\"I can develop about ten tons as far as it goes, but the human body\ncan't take more than five gravities, so we can only visit planets with\nless than that surface gravity. The principle is easy to see; I'll show\nyou.\"\n\nHe unhooked the cables and took the power pack from his back. \"The main\nthing is the molecular power unit here, electrically heated and mounted\non a small, massive gyroscope. That gyro is necessary, too. I tried\nleaving it out and almost took a nosedive. I had it coupled directly to\nthe body and leaned forward a little bit when I was in the air. Without\na gyro to keep the drive upright, I took a loop and started heading for\nthe ground. I had to do some fancy gymnastics to keep from ending up six\nfeet under--literally.\n\n\"The power is all generated in the pack with a small power plate and\nseveral storage coils. I've also got it hooked to these holsters at my\nbelt so we can charge the pistols while we carry them.\n\n\"The control is this secondary power cable running down my arm to my\nhand. That gives you your direction, and the rheostat here at the belt\nchanges the velocity.\n\n\"I've only made this one so far, but I've ordered six others like it. I\nthought you guys might like one, too.\"\n\n\"I think you guessed right!\" said Morey, looking inside the power case.\n\"Hey! Why all the extra room in the case?\"\n\n\"It's an unperfected invention as yet; we might want to put some more\nstuff in there for our own private use.\"\n\nEach of the men tried out the apparatus and found it quite satisfactory.\n\nMeanwhile, there was other work to be done.\n\nWade had been given the job of gathering the necessary food and anything\nelse in the way of supplies that he might think of. Arcot was collecting\nthe necessary spare parts and apparatus. Morey was gathering a small\nlibrary and equipping a chemistry laboratory. Fuller was to get together\nthe necessary standard equipment for the ship--tables, seats, bunks, and\nother furniture.\n\nIt took months of work, and it seemed it would never be finished, but\nfinally, one clear, warm day in August, the ship was completely equipped\nand ready to go.\n\nOn the last inspection, the elder Dr. Arcot and the elder Mr. Morey went\nwith the four younger men. They stood beside the great intergalactic\ncruiser, looking up at its shining hull.\n\n\"We came a bit later than we expected, son,\" said Dr. Arcot, \"but we\nstill expect a good show.\" He paused and frowned, \"I understand you\ndon't intend to take any trial trip. What's the idea?\"\n\nArcot had been afraid his father would be worried about that, so he\nframed his explanation carefully. \"Dad, we figured this ship out to the\nlast decimal place; it's the best we can make it. Remember, the\nmolecular motion drive will get a trial first; we'll give it a trial\ntrip when we leave the sun. If there's any trouble, naturally, we'll\nreturn. But the equipment is standard, so we're expecting no trouble.\n\n\"The only part that would require a trial trip is the space-control\napparatus, and there's no way to give that a trial trip. Remember, we\nhave to get far enough out from the sun so that the gravitational field\nwill be weak enough for the drive to overcome it. If we tried it this\nclose, we'd just be trying to neutralize the sun's gravity. We'd be\npouring out energy, wasting a great deal of it; but out away from the\nsun, we'll get most of the energy back.\n\n\"On the other hand, when we do get out and get started we will go faster\nthan light, and we'd be hopelessly beyond the range of the molecular\nmotion drive in an instant. In other words, if the space-control drive\ndoesn't work, we can't come back, and if it does work, there's no need\nto come back.\n\n\"And if anything goes wrong, we're the only ones who could fix it,\nanyway. If anything goes wrong, I'll radio Earth. You ought to be able\nto hear from me in about a dozen years.\" He smiled suddenly. \"Say! We\nmight go out and get back here in time to hear ourselves talking!\n\n\"But you can see why we felt that there was little reason for a trial\ntrip. If it's a failure, we'll never be back to say so; if it isn't,\nwe'll be able to continue.\"\n\nHis father still looked worried, but he nodded in acquiescence. \"Perfect\nlogic, son, but I guess we may as well give up the discussion.\nPersonally, I don't like it. Let's see this ship of yours.\"\n\nThe great hull was two hundred feet long and thirty feet in diameter.\nThe outer wall, one foot of solid lux metal, was separated from the\ninner, one-inch relux wall by a two inch gap which would be evacuated in\nspace. The two walls were joined in many places by small lux metal\ncross-braces. The windows consisted of spaces in the relux wall,\nallowing the occupants to see through the transparent lux hull.\n\nFrom the outside, it was difficult to detect the exact outline of the\nship, for the clear lux metal was practically invisible and the foot of\nit that surrounded the more visible part of the ship gave a curious\noptical illusion. The perfect reflecting ability of the relux made the\ninner hull difficult to see, too. It was more by absence than presence\nthat one detected it; it blotted out things behind it.\n\nThe great window of the pilot room disclosed the pilot seats and the\ngreat switchboard to one side. Each of the windows was equipped with a\nrelux shield that slid into position at the touch of a switch, and these\nwere already in place over the observatory window, so only the long,\nnarrow portholes showed the lighted interior.\n\nFor some minutes, the elder men stood looking at the graceful beauty of\nthe ship.\n\n\"Come on in--see the inside,\" suggested Fuller.\n\nThey entered through the airlock close to the base of the ship. The\nheavy lux door was opened by automatic machinery from the inside, but\nthe combination depended on the use of a molecular ray and the knowledge\nof the correct place, which made it impossible for anyone to open it\nunless they had the ray and knew where to use it.\n\nFrom the airlock, they went directly to the power room. Here they heard\nthe soft purring of a large oscillator tube and the indistinguishable\nmurmur of smoothly running AC generators powered by large contraterrene\nreactors.\n\nThe elder Dr. Arcot glanced in surprise at the heavy-duty ammeter in a\ncontrol panel.\n\n\"Half a billion amperes! Good Lord! Where is all that power going?\" He\nlooked at his son.\n\n\"Into the storage coils. It's going in at ten kilovolts, so that's a\nfive billion kilowatt supply. It's been going for half an hour and has\nhalf an hour to run. It takes two tons of matter to charge the coil to\ncapacity, and we're carrying twenty tons of fuel--enough for ten\ncharges. We shouldn't need more than three tons if all goes well, but\n'all' seldom does.\n\n\"See that large black cylinder up there?\" Arcot asked, pointing.\n\nAbove them, lying along the roof of the power room, lay a great black\ncylinder nearly two feet in diameter and extending out through the wall\nin the rear. It was made integral with two giant lux metal beams that\nreached to the bow of the ship in a long, sweeping curve. From one of\nthe power switchboards, two heavy cables ran up to the giant cylinder.\n\n\"That's the main horizontal power unit. We can develop an acceleration\nof ten gravities either forward or backward. In the curve of the ship,\non top, sides, and bottom, there are power units for motion in the other\ntwo directions.\n\n\"Most of the rest of the stuff in this section is old hat to you,\nthough. Come on into the next room.\"\n\nArcot opened the heavy relux door, leading the way into the next room,\nwhich was twice the size of the power room. The center of the floor was\noccupied by a heavy pedestal of lux metal upon which was a huge,\nrelux-encased, double torus storage coil. There was a large switchboard\nat the opposite end, while around the room, in ordered groups, stood the\nfamiliar double coils, each five feet in diameter. The space within them\nwas already darkening.\n\n\"Well,\" said Arcot, senior, \"that's some battery of power coils,\nconsidering the amount of energy one can store. But what's the big one\nfor?\"\n\n\"That's the main space control,\" the younger Arcot answered. \"While our\npower is stored in the smaller ones, we can shoot it into this one,\nwhich, you will notice, is constructed slightly differently. Instead of\nholding the field within it, completely enclosed, the big one will\naffect all the space about it. We will then be enclosed in what might be\ncalled a hyperspace of our own making.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said his father. \"You go into hyperspace and move at any speed\nyou please. But how will you see where you're going?\"\n\n\"We won't, as far as I know. I don't expect to see a thing while we're\nin that hyperspace. We'll simply aim the ship in the direction we want\nto go and then go into hyperspace. The only thing we have to avoid is\nstars; their gravitational fields would drain the energy out of the\napparatus and we'd end up in the center of a white-hot star. Meteors and\nsuch, we don't have to worry about; their fields aren't strong enough to\ndrain the coils, and since we won't be in normal space, we can't hit\nthem.\"\n\nThe elder Morey looked worried. \"If you can't see your way back you'll\nget lost! And you can't radio back for help.\"\n\n\"Worse than that!\" said Arcot. \"We couldn't receive a signal of any kind\nafter we get more than three hundred light years away; there weren't any\nradios before that.\n\n\"What we'll do is locate ourselves through the sun's light. We'll take\nphotographs every so often and orient ourselves by them when we come\nback.\"\n\n\"That sounds like an excellent method of stellar navigation,\" agreed\nMorey senior. \"Let's see the rest of the ship.\" He turned and walked\ntoward the farther door.\n\nThe next room was the laboratory. On one side of the room was a complete\nphysics lab and on the other was a well-stocked and well-equipped\nchemistry lab. They could perform many experiments here that no man had\nbeen able to perform due to lack of power. In this ship they had more\ngenerating facilities than all the power stations of Earth combined!\n\nArcot opened the next door. \"This next room is the physics and chemistry\nstoreroom. Here we have a duplicate--in some cases, six or seven\nduplicates--of every piece of apparatus on board, and plenty of material\nto make more. Actually, we have enough equipment to make a new ship out\nof what we have here. It would be a good deal smaller, but it would\nwork.\n\n\"The greater part of our materials is stored in the curvature of the\nship, where it will be easy to get at if necessary. All our water and\nfood is there, and the emergency oxygen tanks.\n\n\"Now let's take the stairway to the upper deck.\"\n\nThe upper deck was the main living quarters. There were several small\nrooms on each side of the corridor down the center; at the extreme nose\nwas the control room, and at the extreme stern was the observatory. The\nobservatory was equipped with a small but exceedingly powerful\ntelectroscope, developed from those the Nigrans had left on one of the\ndeserted planets Sol had captured in return for the loss of Pluto to the\nBlack Star. The arc commanded by the instrument was not great, but it\nwas easy to turn the ship about, and most of their observations could be\nmade without trouble.\n\nEach of the men had a room of his own; there was a small galley and a\nlibrary equipped with all the books the four men could think of as being\nuseful. The books and all other equipment were clamped in place to keep\nthem from flying around loose when the ship accelerated.\n\nThe control room at the nose was surrounded by a hemisphere of\ntransparent lux metal which enabled them to see in every direction\nexcept directly behind, and even that blind spot could be covered by\nstationing a man in the observatory.\n\nThere were heat projectors and molecular ray projectors, each operated\nfrom the control room in the nose. To complete the armament, there were\nmore projectors in the stern, controlled from the observatory, and a\nset on either side controlled from the library and the galley.\n\nThe ship was provisioned for two years--two years without stops. With\nthe possibility of stopping on other planets, the four men could exist\nindefinitely in the ship.\n\nAfter the two older men had been shown all through the intergalactic\nvessel, the elder Arcot turned to his old friend. \"Morey, it looks as if\nit was time for us to leave the _Ancient Mariner_ to her pilots!\"\n\n\"I guess you're right. Well--I'll just say goodbye--but you all know\nthere's a lot more I could say.\" Morey senior looked at them and started\ntoward the airlock.\n\n\"Goodbye, son,\" said the elder Arcot. \"Goodbye, men. I'll be expecting\nyou any time within two years. We can have no warning, I suppose; your\nship will outrace the radio beam. Goodbye.\" Dr. Arcot joined his old\nfriend and they went outside.\n\nThe heavy lux metal door slid into place behind them, and the thick\nplastic cushions sealed the entrance to the airlock.\n\nThe workmen and the other personnel around the ship cleared the area and\nstood well back from the great hull. The two older men waved to the men\ninside the ship.\n\nSuddenly the ship trembled, and rose toward the sky.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nArcot, at the controls of the _Ancient Mariner_, increased the\nacceleration as the ship speared up toward interplanetary space. Soon,\nthe deep blue of the sky had given way to an intense violet, and this\nfaded to the utter black of space as the ship drew away from the planet\nthat was its home.\n\n\"That lump of dust there is going to look mighty little when we get\nback,\" said Wade softly.\n\n\"But,\" Arcot reminded him, \"that little lump of dust is going to pull us\nacross a distance that our imaginations can't conceive of. And we'll be\ndarned happy to see that pale globe swinging in space when we get\nback--provided, of course, that we do get back.\"\n\nThe ship was straining forward now under the pull of its molecular\nmotion power units, accelerating at a steady rate, rapidly increasing\nthe distance between the ship and Earth.\n\nThe cosmic ray power generators were still charging the coils,\npreventing the use of the space strain drive. Indeed, it would be a good\nmany hours before they would be far enough from the sun to throw the\nship into hyperspace.\n\nIn the meantime, Morey was methodically checking every control as Arcot\ncalled out the readings on the control panel. Everything was working to\nperfection. Their every calculation had checked out in practice so far.\nBut the real test was yet to come.\n\nThey were well beyond the orbit of Pluto when they decided they would be\nsafe in using the space strain drive and throwing the ship into\nhyperspace.\n\nMorey was in the hyperspace control room, watching the instruments\nthere. They were ready!\n\n\"Hold on!\" called Arcot. \"Here we go--if at all!\" He reached out to the\ncontrol panel before him and touched the green switch that controlled\nthe molecular motion machines. The big power tubes cut off, and their\nacceleration ceased. His fingers pushed a brilliant red switch--there\nwas a dull, muffled thud as a huge relay snapped shut.\n\nSuddenly, a strange tingling feeling of power ran through them--space\naround them was suddenly black. The lights dimmed for an instant as the\ntitanic current that flowed through the gigantic conductors set up a\nterrific magnetic field, reacting with the absorption plates. The power\nseemed to climb rapidly to a maximum--then, quite suddenly, it was\ngone.\n\nThe ship was quiet. No one spoke. The meters, which had flashed over to\ntheir limits, had dropped back to zero once more, except those which\nindicated the power stored in the giant coil. The stars that had shone\nbrilliantly around them in a myriad of colors were gone. The space\naround them glowed strangely, and there was a vast cloud of strange,\nviolet or pale green stars before them. Directly ahead was one green\nstar that glowed big and brilliant, then it faded rapidly and shrank to\na tiny dot--a distant star. There was a strange tenseness about the men;\nthey seemed held in an odd, compelled silence.\n\nArcot reached forward again. \"Cutting off power, Morey!\" The red tumbler\nsnapped back. Again space seemed to be charged with a vast surplus of\nenergy that rushed in from all around, coursing through their bodies,\nproducing a tingling feeling. Then space rocked in a gray cloud about\nthem; the stars leaped out at them in blazing glory again.\n\n\"Well, it worked once!\" breathed Arcot with a sigh of relief. \"Lord, I\nmade some errors in calculation, though! I hope I didn't make any more!\nMorey--how was it? I only used one-sixteenth power.\"\n\n\"Well, don't use any more, then,\" said Morey. \"We sure traveled! The\nthings worked perfectly. By the way, it's a good thing we had all the\nrelays magnetically shielded; the magnetic field down here was so strong\nthat my pocket kit tried to start running circles around it.\n\n\"According to your magnetic drag meter, the conductors were carrying\nover fifty billion amperes. The small coils worked perfectly. They're\ncharged again; the power went back into them from the big coil with only\na five percent loss of power--about twenty thousand megawatts.\"\n\n\"Hey, Arcot,\" Wade said. \"I thought you said we wouldn't be able to see\nthe stars.\"\n\nArcot spread his hands. \"I did say that, and all my apologies for it.\nBut we're not seeing them by light. The stars all have\nprojections--shadows--in this space because of their intense\ngravitational fields. There are probably slight fluctuations in the\nfield, perhaps one every minute or so. Since we were approaching them at\ntwenty thousand times the speed of light, the Doppler effect gives us\nwhat looks like violet light.\n\n\"We saw the stars in front of us as violet points. The green ones were\nactually behind us, and the green light was tremendously reduced in\nfrequency. It certainly can't be anything less than gamma rays and\nprobably even of greater frequency.\n\n\"Did you notice there were no stars off to the side? We weren't\napproaching them, so they didn't give either effect.\"\n\n\"How did you know which was which?\" asked Fuller skeptically.\n\n\"Did you see that green star directly ahead of us?\" Arcot asked. \"The\none that dwindled so rapidly? That could only have been the sun, since\nthe sun was the only star close enough to show up as a disc. Since it\nwas green and I knew it was behind us, I decided that all the green ones\nwere behind us. It isn't proof, but it's a good indication.\"\n\n\"You win, as usual,\" admitted Fuller.\n\n\"Well, where are we?\" asked Wade. \"I think that's more important.\"\n\n\"I haven't the least idea,\" confessed Arcot. \"Let's see if we can find\nout. I've got the robot pilot on, so we can leave the ship to itself.\nLet's take a look at Old Sol from a distance that no man ever reached\nbefore!\"\n\nThey started for the observatory. Morey joined them and Arcot put the\nview of Sol and his family on the telectroscope screen. He increased the\nmagnification to maximum, and the four men looked eagerly at the system.\nThe sun glowed brilliantly, and the planets showed plainly.\n\n\"Now, if we wanted to take the trouble, we could calculate when the\nplanets were in that position and determine the distance we have come.\nHowever, I notice that Pluto is still in place, so that means we are\nseeing the Solar System as it was before the passing of the Black Star.\nWe're at least two light years away.\"\n\n\"More than that,\" said Morey. He pointed at the screen. \"See here, how\nMars is placed in relation to Venus and Earth? The planets were in that\nconfiguration seven years ago. We're seven light years from Earth.\"\n\n\"Good enough!\" Arcot grinned. \"That means we're within two light years\nof Sirius, since we were headed in that direction. Let's turn the ship\nso we can take a look at it with the telectroscope.\"\n\nSince the power had been cut off, the ship was in free fall, and the men\nwere weightless. Arcot didn't try to walk toward the control room; he\nsimply pushed against the wall with his feet and made a long, slow dive\nfor his destination.\n\nThe others reached for the handgrips in the walls while Arcot swung the\nship gently around so that its stern was pointed toward Sirius. Because\nof its brilliance and relative proximity to Sol, Sirius is the brightest\nstar in the heavens, as seen from Earth. At this much lesser distance,\nit shone as a brilliant point of light that blazed wonderfully. They\nturned the telectroscope toward it, but there was little they could see\nthat was not visible from the big observatory on the Moon.\n\n\"I think we may as well go nearer,\" suggested Morey, \"and see what we\nfind on close range observation. Meanwhile, turn the ship back around\nand I'll take some pictures of the sun and its surrounding star field\nfrom this distance. Our only way of getting back is going to be this\nseries of pictures, so I think we had best make it complete. For the\nfirst light century, we ought to take a picture every ten light years,\nand after that one each light century until we reach a point where we\nare only getting diminishing pictures of the local star cluster. After\nthat, we can wait until we reach the edge of the Galaxy.\"\n\n\"Sounds all right to me,\" agreed Arcot. \"After all, you're the\nastronomer, I'm not. To tell you the truth, I'd have to search a while\nto find Old Sol again. I can't see just where he is. Of course, I could\nlocate him by means of the gyroscope settings, but I'm afraid I wouldn't\nfind him so easily visually.\"\n\n\"Say! You sure are a fine one to pilot an expedition in space!\" cried\nWade in mock horror. \"I think we ought to demote him for that! Imagine!\nHe plans a trip of a thousand million light years, and then gets us out\nseven light years and says he doesn't know where he is! Doesn't even\nknow where home is! I'm glad we have a cautious man like Morey along.\"\nHe shook his head sadly.\n\nThey took a series of six plates of the sun, using different\nmagnifications.\n\n\"These plates will help prove our story, too,\" said Morey as he looked\nat the finished plates. \"We might have gone only a little way into\nspace, up from the plane of the ecliptic and taken plates through a wide\nangle camera. But we'd have had to go at least seven years into the past\nto get a picture like this.\"\n\nThe new self-developing short-exposure plates, while not in perfect\ncolor balance, were more desirable for this work, since they took less\ntime on exposure.\n\nMorey and the others joined Arcot in the control room and strapped\nthemselves into the cushioned seats. Since the space strain mechanism\nhad proved itself in the first test, they felt they needed no more\nobservations than they could make from the control room meters.\n\nArcot gazed out at the spot that was their immediate goal and said\nslowly: \"How much bigger than Sol is that star, Morey?\"\n\n\"It all depends on how you measure size,\" Morey replied. \"It is two and\na half times as heavy, has four times the volume, and radiates\ntwenty-five times as much light. In other words, one hundred million\ntons of matter disappear each second in that star.\n\n\"That's for Sirius A, of course. Sirius B, its companion, is a different\nmatter; it's a white dwarf. It has only one\none-hundred-twenty-five-thousandths the volume of Sirius A, but it\nweighs _one third_ as much. It radiates more per square inch than our\nsun, but, due to its tiny size, it is very faint. That star, though\nalmost as massive as the sun, is only about the size of Earth.\"\n\n\"You sure have those statistics down pat!\" said Fuller, laughing. \"But\nI must say they're interesting. What's that star made of, anyway? Solid\nlux metal?\"\n\n\"Hardly!\" Morey replied. \"Lux metal has a density of around 103, while\nthis star has a density so high that one cubic inch of its matter would\nweigh a ton on Earth.\"\n\n\"Wow!\" Wade ejaculated. \"I'd hate to drop a baseball on my toe on that\nstar!\"\n\n\"It wouldn't hurt you,\" Arcot said, smiling. \"If you could lift the\ndarned thing, you ought to be tough enough to stand dropping it on your\ntoe. Remember, it would weigh about two hundred tons! Think you could\nhandle it?\"\n\n\"At any rate, here we go. When we get there, you can get out and try\nit.\"\n\nAgain came the shock of the start. The heavens seemed to reel about\nthem; the bright spot of Sirius was a brilliant violet point that\nswelled like an expanding balloon, spreading out until it filled a large\nangle.\n\nThen again the heavens reeled, and they were still. The control room was\nfilled with a dazzling splendor of brilliant blue-white light, and an\nintense heat beat in upon them.\n\n\"Brother! Feel that heat,\" said Arcot in awe. \"We'd better watch\nourselves; that thing is giving off plenty of ultraviolet. We could end\nup with third-degree sunburns if we're not careful.\" Suddenly he stopped\nand looked around in surprise. \"Hey! Morey! I thought you said this was\na double star! Look over there! That's no white dwarf--_it's a planet_!\"\n\n\"Ridiculous!\" snapped Morey. \"It's impossible for a planet to be in\nequilibrium about a double star! But--\" He paused, bewildered. \"But it\nis a planet! But--but it can't be! We've made too many measurements on\nthis star to make it possible!\"\n\n\"I don't give a hang whether it can or not,\" Wade said coolly, \"the fact\nremains that it is. Looks as if that shoots a whole flock of holes in\nthat bedtime story you were telling us about a superdense star.\"\n\n\"I make a motion we look more closely first,\" said Fuller, quite\nlogically.\n\nBut at first the telectroscope only served to confuse them more. It was\nmost certainly a planet, and they had a strange, vague feeling of having\nseen it before.\n\nArcot mentioned this, and Wade launched into a long, pedantic discussion\nof how the left and right hemispheres of the brain get out of step at\ntimes, causing a sensation of having seen a thing before when it was\nimpossible to have seen it previously.\n\nArcot gave Wade a long, withering stare and then pushed himself into the\nlibrary without saying a word. A moment later, he was back with a large\nvolume entitled: \"_The Astronomy of the Nigran Invasion_,\" by _D. K.\nHarkness_. He opened the volume to a full-page photograph of the third\nplanet of the Black Star as taken from a space cruiser circling the\nplanet. Silently, he pointed to it and to the image swimming on the\nscreen of the telectroscope.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" said Wade in astonished surprise. \"It's impossible! We came\nhere faster than light, and that planet got here first!\"\n\n\"As you so brilliantly remarked a moment ago,\" Arcot pointed out, \"I\ndon't give a hang whether it can or not--it is. How they did it, I don't\nknow, but it does clear up a number of things. According to the records\nwe found, the ancient Nigrans had a force ray that could move planets\nfrom their orbits. I wonder if it couldn't be used to break up a double\nstar? Also, we know their scientists were looking for a method of moving\nfaster than light; if we can do it, so could they. They just moved their\nwhole system of planets over here after getting rid of the upsetting\ninfluence of the white dwarf.\"\n\n\"Perfect!\" exclaimed Morey enthusiastically. \"It explains everything.\"\n\n\"Except that we saw that companion star when we stopped back there, half\nan hour ago,\" said Fuller.\n\n\"Not half an hour ago,\" Arcot contradicted. \"Two years ago. We saw the\nlight that left the companion before it was moved. It's rather like\ntraveling in time.\"\n\n\"If that's so,\" asked Fuller, suddenly worried, \"what is our time in\nrelation to Earth?\"\n\n\"If we moved by the space-strain drive at all times,\" Arcot explained,\n\"we would return at exactly the same time we left. Time is passing\nnormally on Earth as it is with us right now, but whenever we use the\nspace-strain, we move instantaneously from one point to another as far\nas Earth and the rest of the universe is concerned. It seems to take\ntime to us because we are within the influence of the field.\n\n\"Suppose we were to take a trip that required a week. In other words,\nthree days traveling in space-strain, a day to look at the destination,\nand three more days coming back. When we returned to Earth, they would\ninsist we had only been gone one day, the time we spent out of the\ndrive. See?\"\n\n\"I catch,\" said Fuller. \"By the way, shouldn't we take some photographs\nof this system? Otherwise, Earth won't get the news for several years\nyet.\"\n\n\"Right,\" agreed Morey. \"And we might as well look for the other planets\nof the Black Star, too.\"\n\nThey made several plates, continuing their observations until all the\nplanets had been located, even old Pluto, where crews of Nigran\ntechnicians were obviously at work, building giant structures of lux\nmetal. The great cities of the Nigrans were beginning to bloom on the\nonce bleak plains of the planet. The mighty blaze of Sirius had warmed\nPluto, vaporizing its atmosphere and thawing its seas. The planet that\nthe Black Star had stolen from the Solar System was warmer than it had\nbeen for two billion years.\n\n\"Well, that's it,\" said Arcot when they had finished taking the\nnecessary photographs. \"We can prove we went faster than light easily,\nnow. The astronomers can take up the work of classifying the planets and\ngetting details of the orbits when we get back.\n\n\"Since the Nigrans now have a sun of their own, there should be no\nreason for hostility between our race and theirs. Perhaps we can start\ncommercial trade with them. Imagine! Commerce over quintillions of miles\nof space!\"\n\n\"And,\" interrupted Wade, \"they can make the trip to this system in less\ntime than it takes to get to Venus!\"\n\n\"Meanwhile,\" said Morey, \"let's get on with our own exploration.\"\n\nThey strapped themselves into the control seats once more and Arcot\nthrew in the molecular drive to take them away from the sun toward which\nthey had been falling.\n\nWhen the great, hot disc of Sirius had once more diminished to a tiny\nwhite pinhead of light, Arcot turned the ship until old Sol once more\nshowed plainly on the cross-hairs of the aiming telescope in the rear\nof the vessel.\n\n\"Hold on,\" Arcot cautioned, \"here we go again!\"\n\nAgain he threw the little red tumbler that threw a flood of energy into\nthe coils. The space about them seemed to shiver and grow dim.\n\nArcot had thrown more power into the coils this time, so the stars ahead\nof them instead of appearing violet were almost invisible; they were\nradiating in the ultra-violet now. And the stars behind them, instead of\nappearing to be green, had subsided to a dull red glow.\n\nArcot watched the dull red spark of Sirius become increasingly dimmer.\nThen, quite suddenly, a pale violet disc in front of them ballooned out\nof nowhere and slid off to one side.\n\nThe spaceship reeled, perking the men around in the control seats. Heavy\nsafety relays thudded dully; the instruments flickered under a suddenly\nrising surge of power--then they were calm again. Arcot had snapped over\nthe power switch.\n\n\"That,\" he said quietly, \"is not so good.\"\n\n\"Threw the gyroscopes, didn't it?\" asked Morey, his voice equally as\nquiet.\n\n\"It did--and I have no idea how far. We're off course and we don't know\nwhich direction we're headed.\"\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Fuller anxiously.\n\nArcot pointed out the window at a red star that blazed in the distance.\n\"We got too near the field of gravity of that young giant and he threw\nus for a loss. We drained out three-fourths of the energy from our coils\nand lost our bearings in the bargain. The attraction turned the\ngyroscopes and threw the ship out of line, so we no longer know where\nthe sun is.\n\n\"Well, come on, Morey; all we can do is start a search. At this\ndistance, we'd best go by Sirius; it's brighter and nearer.\" He looked\nat the instrument panel. \"I was using the next lowest power and I still\ncouldn't avoid that monster. This ship is just a little _too_ hot to\nhandle.\"\n\nTheir position was anything but pleasant. They must pick out from the\nvast star field behind them the one star that was home, not knowing\nexactly where it was. But they had one tremendous help--the photographs\nof the star field around Sol that they had taken at the last stop. All\nthey had to do was search for an area that matched their photographs.\n\nThey found the sun at last, after they had spotted Sirius, but they had\nhad to rotate the ship through nearly twenty-five degrees to do it.\nAfter establishing their bearings, they took new photographs for their\nfiles.\n\nMeanwhile, Wade had been recharging the coils. When he was finished, he\nreported the fact to Arcot.\n\n\"Fine,\" Arcot said. \"And from now on, I'm going to use the least\npossible amount of power. It certainly isn't safe to use more.\"\n\nThey started for the control room, much relieved. Arcot dived first,\nwith Wade directly behind him. Wade decided suddenly to go into his room\nand stopped himself by grabbing a handhold. Morey, following close\nbehind, bumped into him and was brought to rest, while Wade was pushed\ninto his room.\n\nBut Fuller, coming last, slammed into Morey, who moved forward with new\nvelocity toward the control room, leaving Fuller hanging at rest in the\nmiddle of the corridor.\n\n\"Hey, Morey!\" he laughed. \"Send me a skyhook! I'm caught!\" Isolated as\nhe was in the middle of the corridor, he couldn't push on anything and\nremained stranded.\n\n\"Go to sleep!\" advised Morey. \"It's the most comfortable bed you'll\nfind!\"\n\nWade looked out of his room just then. \"Well, if it isn't old\nWeakmuscles Fuller! Weighs absolutely nothing and is still so weak he\ncan't push himself around.\"\n\n\"Come on, though, Morey--give me a hand--I got you off dead center.\"\nFuller flailed his hand helplessly.\n\n\"Use your brains, if you have any,\" said Morey, \"and see what you can\ndo. Come on, Wade--we're going.\"\n\nSince they were going to use the space control, they would remain in\nfree fall, and Fuller would remain helplessly suspended in mid-air.\n\nThe air of the ship suddenly seemed supercharged with energy as the\nspace around them became gray; then the stars were all before them. The\nship was moving forward again.\n\n\"Well, old pals,\" said Fuller, \"at least I have traffic blocked fairly\nwell if I feel like it, so eventually you'd have to help me. However--\"\nHe floundered clumsily as he removed one of his foam-rubber space-boots,\n\"--my brains tell me that action is equal and opposite to reaction!\" And\nhe threw the boot with all possible velocity toward Morey!\n\nThe reaction of the motion brought him slowly but surely to a handhold\nin the wall.\n\nIn the meantime, the flying boot caught Morey in the chest with a\npronounced _smack_! as he struggled vainly to avoid it. Handicapped by\nthe lack of friction, his arms were not quite powerful enough to move\nhis mass as quickly as his legs might have done, for his inertia was as\ngreat as ever, so he didn't succeed in ducking.\n\n\"Round one!\" called Arcot, laughing. \"Won by Kid Fuller on a TKO! It\nappears he has brains and knows how to use them!\"\n\n\"You win,\" laughed Morey. \"I concede the battle!\"\n\nArcot had cut off the space-strain drive by the time Fuller reached the\ncontrol room, and the men set about making more observations. They took\nadditional photographs and turned on the drive again.\n\nTime passed monotonously after they had examined a few stars. There was\nlittle difference; each was but a scene of flaming matter. There was\nlittle interest in this work, and, as Fuller remarked, this was supposed\nto be a trip of exploration, not observation. They weren't astronomers;\nthey were on a vacation. Why all the hard work? They couldn't do as good\na job as an experienced astronomer, so they decided to limit their\nobservations to those necessary to retrace their path to Earth.\n\n\"But we want to investigate for planets to land on, don't we?\" asked\nMorey.\n\n\"Sure,\" agreed Fuller. \"But do we have to hunt at random for them? Can't\nwe look for stars like our own sun? Won't they be more apt to have\nplanets like Sol's?\"\n\n\"It's an idea,\" replied Morey.\n\n\"Well, why not try it then?\" Fuller continued logically. \"Let's pick out\na G-0 type sun and head for it.\"\n\nThey were now well out toward the edge of the Galaxy, some thirty\nthousand light years from home. Since they had originally headed out\nalong the narrow diameter of the lens-shaped mass of stars that forms\nour Island Universe, they would reach the edge soon.\n\n\"We won't have much chance of finding a G-0 this far out,\" Arcot pointed\nout. \"We're about out of stars. We've left most of the Galaxy behind\nus.\"\n\n\"Then let's go on to another of the galactic nebulae,\" said Morey,\nlooking out into the almost unbroken night of intergalactic space. Only\nhere and there could they see a star, separated from its nearest\nneighbor by thousands of light years of empty space.\n\n\"You know,\" said Wade slowly, \"I've been wondering about the progress\nalong scientific lines that a race out here might make. I mean, suppose\nthat one of those lonely stars had planets, and suppose intelligent life\nevolved on one of those planets. I think their progress would be much\nslower.\"\n\n\"I see what you mean,\" Arcot said. \"To us, of Earth, the stars are\ngigantic furnaces a few light years away. They're titanic tests tubes of\nnature, with automatic reading devices attached, hung in the sky for us\nto watch. We have learned more about space from the stars than all the\nexperiments of the physicists of Earth ever secured for us. It was in\nthe atoms of the suns that we first counted the rate of revolutions of\nthe electrons about their nuclei.\"\n\n\"Couldn't they have watched their own sun?\" Fuller asked.\n\n\"Sure, but what could they compare it with? They couldn't see a white\ndwarf from here. They couldn't measure the parallax to the nearest star,\nso they would have no idea of stellar distances. They wouldn't know how\nbright S Doradus was. Or how dim Van Maanen's star was.\"\n\n\"Then,\" Fuller said speculatively, \"they'd have to wait until one of\ntheir scientists invented the telectroscope.\"\n\nArcot shook his head. \"Without a knowledge of nuclear physics, the\ninvention of the telectroscope is impossible. The lack of opportunity to\nwatch the stars that might teach them something would delay their\nknowledge of atomic structure. They might learn a great deal about\nchemistry and Newtonian physics, and go quite a ways with math, but even\nthere they would be handicapped. Morey, for instance, would never have\ndeveloped the autointegral calculus, to say nothing of tensor and spinor\ncalculus, which were developed two hundred years ago, without the\nknowledge of the problems of space to develop the need. I'm afraid such\na race would be quite a bit behind us in science.\n\n\"Suppose, on the other hand, we visit a race that's far ahead of us.\nWe'd better not stay there long; think what they might do to us. They\nmight decide our ship was too threatening and simply wipe us out. Or\nthey might even be so far advanced that we would mean nothing to them at\nall--like ants or little squalling babies.\" Arcot laughed at the\nthought.\n\n\"That isn't a very complimentary picture,\" objected Fuller. \"With the\nwonderful advances we've made, there just isn't that much left to be\nable to say we're so little.\"\n\n\"Fuller, I'm surprised at you!\" Arcot said. \"Today, we are only opening\nour eyes on the world of science. Our race has only a few thousand years\nbehind it and hundreds of millions yet to come. How can any man of\ntoday, with his freshly-opened eyes of science, take in the mighty\npyramid of knowledge that will be built up in those long, long years of\nthe future? It's too gigantic to grasp; we can't imagine the things that\nthe ever-expanding mind of man will discover.\"\n\nArcot's voice slowed, and a far-off look came in his eyes.\n\n\"You might say there can be no greater energy than that of matter\nannihilation. I doubt that. I have seen hints of something new--an\nenergy so vast--so transcendently tremendous--that it frightens me. The\nenergies of all the mighty suns of all the galaxies--of the whole\ncosmos--in the hand of man! The energy of a billion billion billion\nsuns! And every sun pouring out its energy at the rate of quintillions\nof horsepower every instant!\n\n\"But it's too great for man to have--I am going to forget it, lest man\nbe destroyed by his own might.\"\n\nArcot's halting speech told of his intense thought--of a dream of such\nawful energies as man had never before conceived. His eyes looked\nunseeing at the black velvet of space with its few, scattered stars.\n\n\"But we're here to decide which way to go,\" he added with a sudden\nbriskness as he straightened his shoulders. \"Every now and then, I get a\nnew idea and I--I sort of dream. That's when I'm most likely to see the\nsolution. I think I know the solution now, but unless the need arises,\nI'm never going to use it. It's too dangerous a toy.\"\n\nThere was silence for a moment, then Morey said, quietly:\n\n\"I've got a course plotted for us. We'll leave this Galaxy at a steep\nangle--about forty-five degrees from the Galactic plane--to give us a\ngood view of our own Galaxy. And we can head for one of the nebulae in\nthat general area. What do you say?\"\n\n\"I say,\" remarked Fuller, \"that some of the great void without seems to\nhave leaked into my own poor self. It's been thirty thousand years since\nI am going to have a meal this morning--whatever it is I mean--and I\nwant another.\" He looked meaningfully at Wade, the official cook of the\nexpedition.\n\nArcot suddenly burst out laughing. \"So that's what I've been wanting!\"\nIt had been ten chronometer hours since they had eaten, but since they\nhad been outracing light, they were now thirty thousand years in Earth's\npast.\n\nThe weightlessness of free fall makes it difficult to recognize normally\nfamiliar sensations, and the feeling of hunger is one of them. There was\nlittle enough work to be done, so there was no great need for\nnourishment, but the ordinary sensation of hunger is not caused by lack\nof nourishment, but an empty stomach.\n\nSleep was another problem. A restless body will not permit a tired brain\nto sleep, and though they had done a great deal of hard mental work, the\nlack of physical fatigue made sleep difficult. The usual \"day\" in space\nwas forty hours, with thirty-hour waking periods and ten hours of sleep.\n\n\"Let's eat, then,\" Arcot decided. \"Afterwards, we'll take a few\nphotographs and then throw this ship into high and really make time.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwo hours later, they were again seated at the control board. Arcot\nreached out and threw the red switch. \"I'm going to give her half power\nfor ten seconds.\" The air about them seemed suddenly snapping with\nunprecedented power--then it was gone as the coil became fully charged.\n\n\"Lucky we shielded those relays,\" Arcot muttered. The tremendous surge\nof current set up a magnetic field that turned knives and forks and, as\nWade found to his intense disgust, stopped watches that were not\nmagnetically shielded.\n\nSpace was utterly black about them now; there wasn't the slightest hint\nof light. The ten seconds that Arcot had allowed dragged slowly. Then at\nlast came the heavy crashing of the huge relays; the current flowed back\ninto the storage coils, and space became normal again. They were alone\nin the blackness.\n\nMorey dove swiftly for the observatory. Before them, there was little to\nsee; the dim glow of nebulae millions of light years away was scarcely\nvisible to the naked eye, despite the clarity of space.\n\nBehind them, like a shining horizon, they saw the mass of the Galaxy for\nthe first time as free observers.\n\nMorey began to make swift calculations of the distance they had come by\nmeasuring the apparent change in diameter of the Galaxy.\n\nArcot floated into the room after him and watched as Morey made his\nobservations and began to work swiftly with pencil and paper. \"What do\nyou make?\" Arcot asked.\n\n\"Mmmmm. Let's see.\" Morey worked a moment with his slide rule. \"We made\ngood time! Twenty-nine light years in ten seconds! You had it on at half\npower--the velocity goes up as the cube of the power--doubling the\npower, then, gives us eight times the velocity--Hmmmmmm.\" He readjusted\nthe slide rule and slid the hairline over a bit. \"We can make ten\nmillion light years in a little less than five days at full power.\n\n\"But I suggest we make another stop in six hours. That will put us about\nfive radii, or half a million light years from the Galaxy. We'll need to\ntake some more photographs to help us retrace our steps to Earth.\"\n\n\"All right, Morey,\" Arcot agreed. \"It's up to you. Get your photos here\nand we'll go on. By the way, I think you ought to watch the instruments\nin the power room; this will be our first test at full power. We figured\nwe'd make twenty light years per second, and it looks as if it's going\nto be closer to twenty-four.\"\n\nA few minutes later, Arcot seated himself at the control board and\nflipped on the intercom to the power room. \"All ready, Morey? I just\nhappened to think--it might be a good idea to pick out our galaxy now\nand start toward it.\"\n\n\"Let's wait,\" cautioned Morey. \"We can't make a very careful choice at\nthis distance, anyway; we're beyond the enlarging power range of the\ntelectroscope here. In another half million light years, we'll have a\nmuch better view, and that comparatively short distance won't take us\nmuch out of our way.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" said Fuller. \"You say we're beyond the magnification\nrange of the telectroscope. Then why would half a million light years\nout of ten million make that much difference?\"\n\n\"Because of the limit of amplification in the tubes,\" Arcot replied.\n\"You can only have so many stages of amplification; after that, you're\namplifying noise. The whole principle of the vacuum tube depends on\nelectronic emission; if you get _too much_ amplification, you can hear\nevery single electron striking the plate of the first tube by the time\nthe thing reaches the last amplifying stage! In other words, if your\nincoming signal is weaker than the minimum noise level on the first\namplifying stage, no amount of amplification will give you anything but\nmore noise.\n\n\"The same is true of the telectroscope image. At this distance, the\nlight signal from those galaxies is weaker than the noise level. We'd\nonly get a flickering, blurred image. But if we go on another half\nmillion light years, the light signal from the nearer nebulae will be\n_stronger_ than the base noise level, and full amplification will give\nus a good image on the screen.\"\n\nFuller nodded. \"Okay, then let's go that additional half million light\nyears. I want to take a look at another galaxy.\"\n\n\"Right.\" Arcot turned to the intercom. \"Ready, Morey?\"\n\n\"Anytime you are.\"\n\n\"Here goes!\" said Arcot. He pushed over the little red control.\n\nAt full power, the air filled with the strain of flowing energy and\nactually broke down in spots with the terrific electrical energy of the\ncharge. There were little snapping sparks in the air, which, though\nharmless electrically, were hot enough to give slight burns, as Wade\nfound to his sorrow.\n\n\"Yike! Say, why didn't you tell us to bring lightning rods?\" he asked\nindignantly as a small spark snapped its way over his hand.\n\n\"Sorry,\" grinned Arcot, \"but most people know enough to stay out of the\nway of those things. Seriously, though, I didn't think the electrostatic\ncurvature would be so slow to adjust. You see, when we build up our\nlight-rate distortion field, other curvatures are affected. We get some\ngravity, some magnetic, and some electrostatic field distortion, too.\nYou can see what happens when they don't leak their energy back into the\ncoil.\n\n\"But we're busy with the instruments; leave the motorman alone!\"\n\nMorey was calling loudly for tests. Although the ship seemed to be\nbehaving perfectly, he wanted check tests to make sure the relays were\nnot being burned, which would keep them from responding properly. By\nrerouting the current around each relay, Arcot checked them one by one.\n\nIt was just as they had finished testing the last one that Fuller\nyelled.\n\n\"Hey! _Look!_\" He pointed out the broad viewport in the side of the\nship.\n\nFar off to their left and far to their right, they saw two shining ships\nparalleling their course. They were shining, sleek ships, their long,\nlongitudinal windows glowing with white light. They seemed to be moving\nat exactly the same speed, holding grimly to the course of the _Ancient\nMariner_. They bracketed the ship like an official guard, despite the\nterrific velocity of the Earthmen's ship.\n\nArcot stared in amazement, his face suddenly clouded in wonder. Morey,\nwho had come up from the power room, stared in equal wonder.\n\nQuickly, Wade and Fuller slid into the ray control seats. Their long\npractice with the rays had made them dead shots, and they had been\nchosen long before as the ship's official ray operators.\n\n\"Lord,\" muttered Morey as he looked at the ships, \"where can they have\ncome from?\"\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nSilently, the four men watched the two ships, waiting for any hostile\nmovement. There was a long, tense moment, then something happened for\nwhich three of them were totally unprepared.\n\nArcot burst into sudden laughter.\n\n\"Don't--ho--hoh-ho--oh--don't shoot!\" he cried, laughing so hard it was\nalmost impossible to understand him. \"Ohoh--space--curved!\" he managed\nto gasp.\n\nFor a moment more, Morey looked puzzled--then he was laughing as hard as\nArcot. Helplessly, Wade and Fuller looked at them, then at each other.\nThen, suddenly, Wade caught the meaning of Arcot's remark and joined the\nother two in laughter.\n\n\"All right,\" said Fuller, still mystified, \"when you half-witted\nphysicists recover, please let me in on the joke!\" He knew it had\nsomething to do with the mysterious ships, so he looked closely at them\nin hopes that he would get the point, too. When he saw it, he blinked in\namazement. \"Hey! What is this? Those ships are exact duplicates of the\n_Ancient Mariner_!\"\n\n\"That--that's what I was laughing at,\" Arcot explained, wiping his eyes.\n\"Four big, brave explorers, scared of their own shadows!\"\n\n\"The light from our own ship has come back to us, due to the intense\ncurvature of the space which encloses us. In normal space, a light ray\nwould take hundreds of millions of years to travel all the way around\nthe Universe and return to its point of origin. Theoretically, it would\nbe possible to photograph our own Galaxy as it was thousands of\nmillennia ago by the light which left it then and has traveled all the\nway around the curvature of space.\n\n\"But our space has such terrific curvature that it only takes a fraction\nof a second for light to make the trip. It has gone all the way around\nour little cosmos and come back again.\n\n\"If we'd shot at it, we would have really done ourselves in! The ray\nbeam would go around and hit us from behind!\"\n\n\"Say, that is a nice proposition!\" laughed Fuller. \"Then we'll be\naccompanied by those ghosts all the way? There goes the spirit 'nine\nfathoms deep' which moves the ship--the ghosts that work the sails. This\nwill be a real _Ancient Mariner_ trip!\"\n\nIt was like that famed voyage in another way, too. The men found little\nto do as they passed on at high speed through the vast realm of space.\nThe chronometer pointed out the hours with exasperating slowness. The\nsix hours that were to elapse before the first stop seemed as many days.\nThey had thought of this trip as a wonderful adventure in itself, but\nthe soundless continued monotony was depressing. They wandered around,\naimlessly. Wade tried to sleep, but after lying strapped in his bunk for\nhalf an hour, he gave up in despair.\n\nArcot saw that the strain of doing nothing was not going to be good for\nhis little crew and decided to see what could be done about it.\n\nHe went down to the laboratory and looked for inspiration. He found it.\n\n\"Hey! Morey! Wade! Fuller! Come on down here! I've got an idea!\" he\ncalled.\n\nThey came to find him looking meditatively at the power pack from one of\nthe flying suits he had designed. He had taken the lux metal case off\nand was looking at the neat apparatus that lay within.\n\n\"These are equipped for use with the space suits, of course,\" Morey\npointed out, \"and that gives us protection against gases. But I wonder\nif we might install protection against mechanical injury--with intent to\ndamage aforethought! In other words, why not equip these suits with a\nsmall invisibility apparatus? We have it on the ship, but we might need\npersonal protection, too.\"\n\n\"Great idea,\" said Wade, \"provided you can find room in that case.\"\n\n\"I think we can. We won't need to add anything but a few tuning devices,\nreally, and they don't take a whale of a lot of power.\"\n\nArcot pointed out the places where they could be put; also, he replaced\nsome of the old induction coils with one of his new storage cells and\ngot far higher efficiency from the tubes.\n\nBut principally, it was something to do.\n\nIndeed, it was so thoroughly something to do that the six hours had\nalmost elapsed before they realized it. In a very short time, they\nreturned again to the control room and strapped themselves in.\n\nArcot reached toward the little red switch that controlled the titanic\nenergies of the huge coil below and pulled it back a quarter of the way.\n\n\"There go the ghosts!\" he said. The images had quickly disappeared,\nseemingly leaping away from them at terrific speed as the space in which\nthe ship was enclosed opened out more and more and the curvature\ndecreased. They were further away from themselves!\n\nEasing back a quarter at a time, to prevent sparks again flying about in\nthe atmosphere of the ship, Arcot cut the power to zero, and the ship\nwas standing still once more.\n\nThey hurriedly dived to the observatory and looked eagerly out the\nwindow.\n\nFar, far behind them, floating in the marvelous, soft, utter blackness\nof space, was a shining disc made up of myriads of glowing points. And\nit didn't seem to be a huge thing at a great distance, but simply a\nsmall glowing object a few feet outside the window.\n\nSo perfectly clear was their view through the lux metal wall and the\nblack, empty space that all sense of distance was lost. It seemed more a\nminiature model of their universe--a tiny thing that floated close\nbehind them, unwavering, shining with a faint light, a heatless\nillumination that made everything in the darkened observatory glow very\nfaintly. It was the light of three hundred million suns seen at a\ndistance of three million million million miles! And it seemed small\nbecause there was nothing with which to compare it.\n\nIt was an amazingly beautiful thing, that tiny floating disc of light.\n\nMorey floated over to the cameras and began to take pictures.\n\n\"I'd like to take a color shot of that,\" he said a few minutes later,\n\"but that would require a direct shot through the reflector telescope\nand a time exposure. And I can't do that; the ship is moving.\"\n\n\"Not enough to make any difference,\" Arcot contradicted. \"We're moving\naway from it in a straight line, and that thing is three quintillion\nmiles away. We're not moving fast enough to cause any measurable\ncontraction in a time exposure. As for having a steady platform, this\nship weighs a quarter of a million tons and is held by gyroscopes. We\nwon't shake it.\"\n\nWhile Morey took the time exposure, Arcot looked at the enlarged image\nin the telectroscope and tried to make angular measurements from the\nindividual stars. This he found impossible. Although he could spot\nBetelgeuse and Antares because of their tremendous radiation, they were\ntoo close together for measurements; the angle subtended was too small.\n\nFinally, he decided to use the distance between Antares and S Doradus in\nthe Lesser Magellanic Cloud, one of the two clouds of stars which float\nas satellites to the Galaxy itself.\n\nTo double-check, he used the radius of the Galaxy as base to calculate\nthe distance. The distances checked. The ship was five hundred thousand\nlight years from home!\n\nAfter all the necessary observations were made, they swung the ship on\nits axis and looked ahead for a landing place.\n\nThe nebulae ahead were still invisible to the naked eye except as\npoints, but the telectroscope finally revealed one as decidedly nearer\nthan the rest. It seemed to be a young Island Universe, for there was\nstill a vast cloud of gas and dust from which stars were yet to be born\nin the central whorl--a single titanic gas cloud that stretched out\nthrough a million billion miles of space.\n\n\"Shall we head for that?\" asked Arcot at last, as Morey finished his\nobservations.\n\n\"I think it would be as good as any--there are more stars there than we\ncan hope to visit.\"\n\n\"Well, then, here we go!\"\n\nArcot dived for the control room, while Morey shut off the telectroscope\nand put the latest photographs in the file.\n\nSuddenly space was snapping about him--they were off again. Another\nshock of surging energy--another--the ship leaped forward at tremendous\nspeed--still greater--then they were rushing at top speed, and beside\nthem ran the ghost ships of the _Ancient Mariner_.\n\nMorey pushed himself into the control room just as Arcot, Wade, and\nFuller were getting ready to start for the lab.\n\n\"We're off for quite a while, now,\" he said. \"Our goal is about five\ndays away. I suggest we stop at the end of four days, make more\naccurate measurements, then plan a closer stop.\n\n\"I think from now on we ought to sleep in relays, so that there will be\nthree of us awake at all times. I'll turn in now for ten hours, and then\nsomeone else can sleep. Okay?\"\n\nIt was agreed, and in the meantime the three on duty went down to the\nlab to work.\n\nArcot had finished the installation of the invisibility apparatus in his\nsuit at the end of ten hours, much to his disappointment. He tested it,\nthen cast about for something to do while Wade and Morey added the\nfinishing touches to theirs.\n\nMorey came down, and when Wade had finished his, which took another\nquarter of an hour, he took the off duty shift.\n\nArcot had gone to the library, and Morey was at work down below. Fuller\nhad come up, looking for something to do, and had hit upon the excellent\nidea of fixing a meal.\n\nHe had just begun his preparations in the kitchen when suddenly the\n_Ancient Mariner_ gave a violent leap, and the men, not expecting any\nweight, suddenly fell in different ways with terrific force!\n\nFuller fell half the length of the galley and was knocked out by the\nblow. Wade, asleep in bed, was awakened violently by the shock, and\nMorey, who had been strapped in his chair, was badly shaken.\n\nEveryone cried out simultaneously--and Arcot was on his way to the\ncontrol room. The first shock was but a forerunner of the storm.\nSuddenly the ship was hurled violently about; the air was shot through\nwith great burning sparks; the snapping hiss of electricity was\neverywhere, and every pointed metal object was throwing streamers of\nblue electric flame into the air! The ship rocked, heaved, and cavorted\nwildly, as though caught in the play of titanic forces!\n\nScrambling wildly along the hand-holds, Arcot made his way towards the\ncontrol room, which was now above, now below, and now to one side of him\nas the wildly variable acceleration shook the ship. Doggedly, he worked\nhis way up, frequently getting severe burns from the flaming sparks.\n\nBelow, in the power room, the relays were crashing in and out wildly.\n\nThen, suddenly, a new sound was added just as Arcot pulled himself into\nthe control chair and strapped himself down. The radiation detector\nbuzzed out its screaming warning!\n\n\"COSMIC RAYS!\" Arcot yelled. \"HIGH CONCENTRATION!\"\n\nHe slapped at the switch which shot the heavy relux screens across every\nwindow in the ship.\n\nThere was a sudden crash and a fuse went out below--a fuse made of a\nsilver bar two feet thick! In an instant, the flames of the burning\nsparks flared up and died. The ship cavorted madly, shaking mightily in\nthe titanic, cosmic forces that surrounded it--the forces that made the\nhighest energy form in the universe!\n\nArcot knew that nothing could be done with the power coil. It was\ndrained; the circuit was broken. He shifted in the molecular drive,\npushing the acceleration to four gravities, as high as the men could\nstand.\n\nAnd still the powerful ship was being tossed about, the plaything of\ninconceivable forces. They lived only because the forces did not try to\nturn the ship more violently, not because of the strength of the ship,\nfor nothing could resist the awful power around them.\n\nAs a guide, Arcot used the compass gyroscope, the only one not twisted\nfar out of its original position; with it, he managed to steer a fairly\nstraight course.\n\nMeanwhile, in the power room, Wade and Morey were working frantically to\nget the space-strain drive coil recharged. Despite the strength-sapping\nstrain of working under four gravities of acceleration, they managed to\nget the auxiliary power unit into operation. In a few moments, they had\nit pouring its energies into the coil-bank so that they could charge up\nthe central drive coil.\n\nAnother silver bar fuse was inserted, and Wade checked the relays to\nmake sure they were in working order.\n\nFuller, who had regained consciousness, worked his way laboriously down\nto the power room carrying three space-suits. He had stopped in the lab\nto get the power belts, and the three men quickly donned them to help\nthem overcome the four-gravity pull.\n\nAnother half hour sped by as the bucking ship forced its way through the\nterrific field in space.\n\nSuddenly they felt a terrific jolt again--then the ship was moving more\nsmoothly, and gradually it was calm. They were through!\n\n\"Have we got power for the space-strain drive yet?\" Arcot called through\nthe intercom.\n\n\"Enough,\" Morey cried. \"Try it!\"\n\nArcot cut off the molecular motion drive, and threw in all the\nspace-control power he had. The ship was suddenly supercharged with\nenergy. It jarred suddenly--then was quiet. He allowed ten minutes to\npass, then he cut off the drive and allowed the ship to go into free\nfall.\n\nMorey's voice came over the intercom. \"Arcot, things are really busted\nup down here! We had to haywire half the drive together.\"\n\n\"I'll be right down. Every instrument on the ship seems to be out of\nkilter!\"\n\nIt was a good thing they had plenty of spare parts; some of the smaller\nrelays had burned out completely, and several of the power leads had\nfused under the load that had been forced through them.\n\nThe space-strain drive had been leaking energy at a terrific rate;\nwithout further repair, it could not function much longer.\n\nIn the power room, Arcot surveyed the damage. \"Well, boys, we'd better\nget to work. We're stranded here until we get that drive repaired!\"\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nForty hours later, Arcot was running the ship smoothly at top speed once\nagain. The four men had gone to bed after more than thirty hours of hard\nwork. That, coupled with the exhaustion of working under four gravities,\nas they had while the ship was going through the storm, was enough to\nmake them sleep soundly.\n\nArcot had awakened before the others and had turned on the drive after\nresetting their course.\n\nAfter that was done, there was little to do, and time began to hang\nheavily on Arcot's hands. He decided to make a thorough inspection of\nthe hull when the others awoke. The terrific strain might have opened\ncracks in the lux metal hull that would not be detectable from the\ninside because the inner wall was separated from the outer envelope.\n\nAccordingly, he got out the spacesuits, making sure the oxygen tanks\nwere full and all was ready. Then he went into the library, got out some\nbooks, and set about some calculations he had in mind.\n\nWhen Morey woke, some hours later, he found Arcot still at work on his\ncalculations.\n\n\"Hey!\" he said, swinging himself into the chair beside Arcot, \"I thought\nyou'd be on the lookout for more cosmic rays!\"\n\n\"Curious delusion, wasn't it?\" asked Arcot blandly. \"As a matter of\nfact, I've been busy doing some figuring. I think our chance of meeting\nanother such region is about one in a million million million million.\nConsidering those chances, I don't think we need to worry. I don't see\nhow we ever met _one_--but the chances of hitting one are better than\nhitting two.\"\n\nJust then Fuller stuck his head in the door.\n\n\"Oh,\" he said, \"so you're at it already? Well, I wonder if one of you\ncould tell me just what it was we hit? I've been so busy I haven't had a\nchance to think.\"\n\n\"Don't take the chance now, then,\" grinned Morey. \"You might strain your\nbrain.\"\n\n\"_Please_!\" Fuller pleaded, wincing. \"Not before breakfast. Just explain\nwhat that storm was.\"\n\n\"We simply came to a region in space where cosmic rays are created,\"\nexplained Arcot.\n\nFuller frowned. \"But there's nothing out here to generate cosmic rays!\"\n\nArcot nodded. \"True. I think I know their real source, but I believe\nI'll merely say they are created here. I want to do more work on this.\nMy idea for an energy source greater than any other in the universe has\nbeen confirmed.\n\n\"At any rate, they are created in that space, a perfect vacuum, and the\nspace there is distorted terrifically by the titanic forces at work. It\nis bent and twisted far out of the normal, even curvature, and it was\nthat bumpy spot in space that threw us about so.\n\n\"When we first entered, using the space-strain drive, the space around\nthe ship, distorted as it was, conflicted with the region of the cosmic\nray generation and the ship lost out. The curvature of space that the\nship caused was sometimes reinforced and sometimes cancelled out by the\ntwisted space around it, and the tremendous surges of current back and\nforth from the main power coil to the storage coils caused the electric\ndischarges that kept burning through the air. I notice we all got a few\nburns from that. The field was caused by the terrific surges of current,\nand that magnetic field caused the walls of the ship to heat up due to\nthe generation of electric current in the walls.\"\n\nFuller looked around at the walls of the ship. \"Well, the _Ancient\nMariner_ sure took a beating.\"\n\n\"As a matter of fact, I was worried about that,\" said Arcot. \"Strong as\nthat hull is, it might easily have been strained in that field of\nterrific force. If it happened to hit two 'space waves' at once, it\nmight have given it an acceleration in two different directions at once,\nwhich would strain the walls with a force amounting to thousands of\ntons. I laid out the suits up front, and I think we might reasonably get\nout there and take a look at the old boat. When Wade gets up--well,\nwell--speak of the devil! My, doesn't he look energetic?\"\n\nWade's huge body was floating in through the library door. He was\nyawning sleepily and rubbing his eyes. It was evident he had not yet\nwashed, and his growing beard, which was heavy and black on his cheeks,\ntestified to his need for a shave. The others had shaved before coming\ninto the library.\n\n\"Wade,\" said Arcot, \"we're going outside, and we have to have someone in\nhere to operate the airlock. Suppose you get to work on the hirsute\nadornment; there's an atomic hydrogen cutting torch down in the lab you\ncan use, if you wish. The rest of us are going outside.\" Then Arcot's\nvoice became serious. \"By the way, don't try any little jokes like\nstarting off with a little acceleration. I don't think you would--you've\ngot good sense--but I like to make certain. If you did, we'd be left\nbehind, and you'd never find us in the vast immensity of intergalactic\nspace.\"\n\nIt wasn't a pleasant idea to contemplate. Each of the suits had a radio\nfor communication with each other and with the ship, but they would only\ncarry a few hundred miles. A mere step in space!\n\nWade shook his head, grinning. \"I have no desire to be left all by\nmyself on this ship, thank you. You don't need to worry.\"\n\nA few minutes later, Arcot, Morey, and Fuller stepped out of the airlock\nand set to work, using power flashlights to examine the outer hull for\nany signs of possible strain.\n\nThe flashlights, equipped as they were with storage coils for power,\nwere actually powerful searchlights, but in the airlessness of space,\nthe rays were absolutely invisible. They could only be seen when they\nhit the relux inner wall at such an angle that they were reflected\ndirectly into the observer's eyes. The lux metal wall, being\ntransparent, was naturally invisible, and the smooth relux, reflecting\none hundred percent of the incident light, did not become illuminated,\nfor illumination is the result of the scattering of light.\n\nIt was necessary to look closely and pass the beams over every square\ninch of the surface. However, a crack would be rough, and hence would\nscatter light and be even more readily visible than otherwise.\n\nTo their great relief, after an hour and a half of careful inspection,\nnone of them had found any signs of a crack, and they went back into the\nship to resume the voyage.\n\nAgain they hurled through space, the twin ghost ships following them\nclosely. Hour after hour the ship went on. Now they had something else\nto do. They were at work calculating some problems that Arcot had\nsuggested in connection with the velocities of motion that had been\nobserved in the stars at the edge of the island universe they were\napproaching. Since these stars revolved about the mass of the entire\ngalaxy, it was possible to calculate the mass of the entire universe by\naveraging the values from several stars. Their results were not exact,\nbut they were reliable enough. They found the universe to have a mass of\ntwo hundred and fifty million suns, only a little less than the home\nGalaxy. It was an average-sized nebula.\n\nStill the hours dragged as they came gradually nearer their\ngoal--gradually, despite their speed of twenty-four light years per\nsecond!\n\nAt the end of the second day after their trouble with the cosmic ray\nfield, they stopped for observation. They were now so near the Island\nUniverse that the stars spread out in a huge disc ahead of them.\n\n\"About three hundred thousand light years distant, I should guess,\" said\nMorey.\n\n\"We know our velocity fairly accurately,\" said Wade. \"Why can't we\ncalculate the distance between two of these stars and then go on in?\"\n\n\"Good idea,\" agreed Arcot. \"Take the angle, will you, Morey? I'll swing\nthe ship.\"\n\nAfter taking their measurements, they advanced for one hour. Knowing\nthis distance from experience, they were able to calculate the diameter\nof this galaxy. It turned out to be on the order of ninety thousand\nlight years.\n\nThey were now much closer; they seemed, indeed, on the very edge of the\ngiant universe. The thousands of stars flamed bright below them,\nstretching across their horizon more and more--a galaxy the eyes of men\nhad never before seen at such close range! This galaxy had not yet\ncondensed entirely to stars, and in its heart there still remained the\nvast gas cloud that would eventually be stars and planets. The vast\nmisty cloud was plainly visible, glowing with a milky light like some\nvast frosted light bulb.\n\nIt was impossible to conceive the size of the thing; it looked only like\nsome model, for they were still over a quarter of a million light years\nfrom it.\n\nMorey looked up from his calculations. \"I think we should be there in\nabout three hours. Suppose we go at full speed for about two hours and\nthen change to low speed?\"\n\n\"You're the astronomical boss, Morey,\" said Arcot. \"Let's go!\"\n\nThey swung the ship about once more and started again. As they drew\nnearer to this new universe, they began to feel more interest in the\ntrip. Things were beginning to happen!\n\nThe ship plunged ahead at full speed for two hours. They could see\nnothing at that velocity except the two ghost ships that were their\never-present companions. Then they stopped once more.\n\nAbout them, they saw great suns shining. One was so close they could see\nit as a disc with the naked eye. But they could not see clearly; the\nentire sky was misty and the stars that were not close were blotted out.\nThe room seemed to grow warm.\n\n\"Hey! Your calculations were off!\" called Arcot. \"We're getting out of\nhere!\"\n\nSuddenly the air snapped and they were traveling at low speed under the\ndrive of the space-strain apparatus. The entire space about them was lit\nwith a dim violet glow. In ten minutes, the glow was gone and Arcot cut\nthe drive.\n\nThey were out in ordinary dark space, with its star-studded blackness.\n\n\"What was the matter with my calculations?\" Morey wanted to know.\n\n\"Oh, nothing much,\" Arcot said casually. \"You were only about thirty\nthousand light years off. We landed right in the middle of the central\ngas cloud, and we were plowing through it at a relative velocity of\naround sixteen thousand miles per second! No wonder we got hot!\n\n\"We're lucky we didn't come near any stars in the process; if we had, we\ncould have had to recharge the coil.\"\n\n\"It's a wonder we didn't burn up at that velocity,\" said Fuller.\n\n\"The gas wasn't dense enough,\" Arcot explained. \"That gas is a better\nvacuum than the best pump could give you on Earth; there are fewer\nmolecules per cubic inch than there are in a radio tube.\n\n\"But now that we're out of that, let's see if we can find a planet. No\nneed to take photographs going in; if we want to find the star again, we\ncan take photos as we leave. If we don't want to find it, we would just\nwaste film.\n\n\"I'll leave it to Morey to find the star we want.\"\n\nMorey set to work at once with the telescope; trying to find the nearest\nstar of spectral type G-0, as had been agreed upon. He also wanted to\nfind one of the same magnitude, or brilliance. At last, after\ninvestigating several such suns, he discovered one which seemed to\nfulfill all his wishes. The ship was turned, and they started toward the\nadventure they had really hoped to find.\n\nAs they rushed through space, the distorted stars shining vividly before\nthem, they saw the one which was their goal. A bright, slowly changing\nviolet point on the cross-hairs of the aiming telescope.\n\n\"How far is it?\" asked Arcot.\n\n\"About thirty light centuries,\" replied Morey, watching the star\neagerly.\n\nThey drove on in silence. Then, suddenly, Morey cried out: \"Look! It's\ngone!\"\n\n\"What happened?\" asked Arcot in surprise.\n\nMorey rubbed his chin in thought. \"The star suddenly flared brightly for\nan instant, then disappeared. Evidently, it was a G-0 giant which had\nburned up most of the hydrogen that stars normally use for fuel. When\nthat happens, a star begins to collapse, increasing in brilliance due to\nthe heat generated by the gas falling toward the center of the star.\n\n\"Then other nuclear reactions begin to take place, and, due to the\nincreased transparency of the star, a supernova is produced. The star\nblows away most of its gaseous envelope, leaving only the superdense\ncore. In other words, it leaves a white dwarf.\" He paused and looked at\nArcot. \"I wonder if that star did have any planets?\"\n\nThey all knew what he meant. What was the probable fate of beings whose\nsun had suddenly collapsed to a tiny, relatively cold point in the sky?\n\nSuddenly, there loomed before them the dim bulk of the star, a disc\nalready, and Arcot snapped the ship over to the molecular motion drive\nat once. He knew they must be close. Before them was the angry disc of\nthe flaming white star.\n\nArcot swung the ship a bit to one side, running in close to the flaming\nstar. It was not exceedingly hot, despite the high temperature and\nintense radiation, for the radiating surface was too small.\n\nThey swung about the star in a parabolic orbit, for, at their velocity,\nthe sun could not hold them in a planetary orbit.\n\n\"Our velocity, relative to this star, is pretty high,\" Arcot announced.\n\"I'm swinging in close so that I can use the star's attraction as a\nbrake. At this distance, it will be about six gravities, and we can add\nto that a molecular drive braking of four gravities.\n\n\"Suppose you look around and see if there are any planets. We can break\nfree and head for another star if there aren't.\"\n\nEven at ten gravities of deceleration, it took several hours to reduce\ntheir speed to a point which would make it possible to head for any\nplanet of the tiny sun.\n\nMorey went to the observatory and swept the sky with the telectroscope.\n\nIt was difficult to find planets because the reflected light from the\nweak star was so dim, but he finally found one. He took angular readings\non it and on the central sun. A little later, he took more readings.\nBecause of the changing velocity of the ship, the readings were not too\naccurate, but his calculations showed it to be several hundred million\nmiles out.\n\nThey were decelerating rapidly, and soon their momentum had been reduced\nto less than four miles a second. When they reached the planet, Arcot\nthrew the ship into an orbit around it and began to spiral down.\n\nThrough the clear lux windows of the control room, the men looked down\nupon a bleak, frozen world.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nBelow the ship lay the unfamiliar panorama of an unknown world that\ncircled, frozen, around a dim, unknown sun, far out in space. Cold and\nbleak, the low, rolling hills below were black, bare rock, coated in\nspots with a white sheen of what appeared to be snow, though each of the\nmen realized it must be frozen air. Here and there ran strange rivers\nof deep blue which poured into great lakes and seas of blue liquid.\nThere were mighty mountains of deep blue crystal looming high, and in\nthe hollows and cracks of these crystal mountains lay silent, motionless\nseas of deep blue, unruffled by any breeze in this airless world. It was\na world that lay frozen under a dim, dead sun.\n\nThey continued over the broad sweep of the level, crystalline plain as\nthe bleak rock disappeared behind them. This world was about ten\nthousand miles in diameter, and its surface gravity about a quarter\ngreater than that of Earth.\n\nOn and on they swept, swinging over the planet at an altitude of less\nthan a thousand feet, viewing the unutterably desolate scene of the\ncold, dead world.\n\nThen, ahead of them loomed a bleak, dark mass of rock again. They had\ncrossed the frozen ocean and were coming to land again--a land no more\nsolid than the sea.\n\nEverywhere lay the deep drifts of snow, and here and there, through\nvalleys, ran the streams of bright blue.\n\n\"Look!\" cried Morey in sudden surprise. Far ahead and to their left\nloomed a strange formation of jutting vertical columns, covered with the\nwhite burden of snow. Arcot turned a powerful searchlight on it, and it\nstood out brightly against the vast snowfield. It was a dead, frozen\ncity.\n\nAs they looked at it, Arcot turned the ship and headed for it without a\nword.\n\nIt was hard to realize the enormity of the catastrophe that had brought\na cold, bleak death to the population of this world--death to an\nintelligent race.\n\nArcot finally spoke. \"I'll land the ship. I think it will be safe for us\nall to leave. Get out the suits and make sure all the tanks are charged\nand the heaters working. It will be colder here than in space. Out\nthere, we were only cooled by radiation, but those streams are probably\nliquid nitrogen, oxygen, and argon, and there's a slight atmosphere of\nhydrogen, helium and neon cooled to about fifty degrees Absolute. We'll\nbe cooled by conduction and convection.\"\n\nAs the others got the suits ready, he lowered the ship gently to the\nsnowy ground. It sank into nearly ten feet of snow. He turned on the\npowerful searchlight, and swept it around the ship. Under the warm\nbeams, the frozen gasses evaporated, and in a few moments he had cleared\nthe area around the ship.\n\nMorey and the others came back with their suits. Arcot donned his, and\nadjusted his weight to ten pounds with the molecular power unit.\n\nA short time later, they stepped out of the airlock onto the ice field\nof the frozen world. High above them glowed the dim, blue-white disc of\nthe tiny sun, looking like little more than a bright star.\n\nAdjusting the controls on the suits, the four men lifted into the\ntenuous air and headed toward the city, moving easily about ten feet\nabove the frozen wastes of the snow field.\n\n\"The thing I don't understand,\" Morey said as they shot toward the city,\n\"is why this planet is here at all. The intense radiation from the sun\nwhen it went supernova should have vaporized it!\"\n\nArcot pointed toward a tall, oddly-shaped antenna that rose from the\nhighest building of the city. \"There's your answer. That antenna is\nsimilar to those we found on the planets of the Black Star; it's a heat\nscreen. They probably had such antennas all over the planet.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the screen's efficiency goes up as the fourth power of\nthe temperature. It could keep out the terrific heat of a supernova, but\ncouldn't keep in the heat of the planet after the supernova had died.\nThe planet was too cool to make the screen work efficiently!\"\n\nAt last they came to the outskirts of the dead city. The vertical walls\nof the buildings were free of snow, and they could see the blank,\nstaring eyes of the windows, and within, the bleak, empty rooms. They\nswept on through the frozen streets until they came to one huge building\nin the center. The doors of bronze had been closed, and through the\nwindows they could see that the room had been piled high with some sort\nof insulating material, evidently used as a last-ditch attempt to keep\nout the freezing cold.\n\n\"Shall we break in?\" asked Arcot.\n\n\"We may as well,\" Morey's voice answered over the radio. \"There may be\nsome records we could take back to Earth and have deciphered. In a time\nlike this, I imagine they would leave some records, hoping that some\nrace _might_ come and find them.\"\n\nThey worked with molecular ray pistols for fifteen minutes tearing a way\nthrough. It was slow work because they had to use the heat ray pistols\nto supply the necessary energy for the molecular motion.\n\nWhen they finally broke through, they found they had entered on the\nsecond floor; the deep snow had buried the first. Before them stretched\na long, richly decorated hall, painted with great colored murals.\n\nThe paintings displayed a people dressed in a suit of some soft, white\ncloth, with blond hair that reached to their shoulders. They were\nshorter and more heavily built than Earthmen, perhaps, but there was a\ngrace to them that denied the greater gravity of their planet. The\nmurals portrayed a world of warm sunlight, green plants, and tall trees\nwaving in a breeze--a breeze of air that now lay frozen on the stone\nfloors of their buildings.\n\nScene after scene they saw--then they came to a great hall. Here they\nsaw hundreds of bodies; people wrapped in heavy cloth blankets. And over\nthe floor of the room lay little crystals of green.\n\nWade looked at the little crystals for a long time, and then at the\npeople who lay there, perfectly preserved by the utter cold. They seemed\nonly sleeping--men, women, and children, sleeping under a blanket of\nsoft snow that evaporated and disappeared as the energy of the lights\nfell on it. There was one little group the men looked at before they\nleft the room of death. There were three in it--a young man, a fair,\nblonde young woman who seemed scarcely more than a girl, and between\nthem, a little child. They were sleeping, arms about each other, warm in\nthe arms of Death, the kindly Reliever of Pain.\n\nArcot turned and rose, flying swiftly down the long corridor toward the\ndoor.\n\n\"That was not meant for us,\" he said. \"Let's leave.\"\n\nThe others followed.\n\n\"But let's see what records they left,\" he went on. \"It may be that they\nwanted us to know their tragic story. Let's see what sort of\ncivilization they had.\"\n\n\"Their chemistry was good, at least,\" said Wade. \"Did you notice those\ngreen crystals? A quick, painless poison gas to relieve them of the\nstruggle against the cold.\"\n\nThey went down to the first floor level, where there was a single great\ncourt. There were no pillars, only a vast, smooth floor.\n\n\"They had good architecture,\" said Morey. \"No pillars under all the vast\nload of that building.\"\n\n\"And the load is even greater under this gravity,\" remarked Arcot.\n\nIn the center of the room was a great, golden bronze globe resting on a\nplatform of marble. It must have been new when this world froze, for\nthere was no sign of corrosion or oxidation. The men flew over to it and\nstood beside it, looking at the great sphere, nearly fifteen feet in\ndiameter.\n\n\"A globe of their world,\" said Fuller, looking at it with interest.\n\n\"Yes,\" agreed Arcot, \"and it was set up after they were sure the cold\nwould come, from the looks of it. Let's take a look at it.\" He flew up\nto the top of it and viewed it from above. The whole globe was a\ncarefully chiseled relief map, showing seas, mountains, and continents.\n\n\"Arcot--come here a minute,\" called Morey. Arcot dropped down to where\nMorey was looking at the globe. On the edge of one of the continents was\na small raised globe, and around the globe, a circle had been etched.\n\n\"I think this is meant to represent this globe,\" Morey said. \"I'm almost\ncertain it represents this very spot. Now look over here.\" He pointed to\na spot which, according to the scale of the globe, was about five\nthousand miles away. Projecting from the surface of the bronze globe\nwas a little silver tower.\n\n\"They want us to go there,\" continued Morey. \"This was erected only\nshortly before the catastrophe; they must have put relics there that\nthey want us to get. They must have guessed that eventually intelligent\nbeings would cross space; I imagine they have other maps like this in\nevery large city.\n\n\"I think it's our duty to visit that cairn.\"\n\n\"I quite agree,\" assented Arcot. \"The chance of other men visiting this\nworld is infinitely small.\"\n\n\"Then let's leave this City of the Dead!\" said Wade.\n\nIt gave them a sense of depression greater than that inspired by the\nvast loneliness of space. One is never so lonely as when he is with the\ndead, and the men began to realize that the original _Ancient Mariner_\nhad been more lonely with strange companions than they had been in the\ndepths of ten million light years of space.\n\nThey went back to the ship, floating through the last remnants of this\nworld's atmosphere, back through the chill of the frozen gases to the\ncheering, warm interior of the ship.\n\nIt was a contrast that made each of them appreciate more fully the gift\nthat a hot, blazing sun really is. Perhaps that was what made Fuller\nask: \"If this happened to a star so much like our sun, why couldn't it\nhappen to Sol?\"\n\n\"Perhaps it may,\" said Morey softly. \"But the eternal optimism of man\nkeeps us saying: 'It can't happen here.' And besides--\" He put a hand on\nthe wall of the ship, \"--we don't ever have to worry about anything like\nthat now. Not with ships like this to take us to a new sun--a new\nplanet.\"\n\nArcot lifted the ship and flew over the cold, frozen ground beneath\nthem, following the route indicated on the great globe in the dead city.\nMile after mile of frozen ice fields flew by as they shot over it at\nthree miles per second.\n\nSuddenly, the bleak bulk of a huge mountain loomed gigantic before them.\nArcot reversed the power and brought the ship to a stop. With the\npowerful searchlight, he swept the area, looking for the tower he knew\nshould be here. At last, he made it out, a pyramid rather than a tower,\nand coated over with ice. They soon thawed out the frozen gasses by\nplaying the energy of three powerful searchlights upon them, and in a\nfew minutes the glint of gold showed through the melting ice and show.\n\n\"It looks,\" said Wade, \"as though they have an outer wall of gold over a\nstrong wall of iron or steel to protect it from corrosion. Certainly\ngold doesn't have enough tensile strength to hold itself up under this\ngravity--not in such masses as that.\"\n\nArcot brought the ship down beside the tower and the men once more went\nout through the airlock into the cold of the almost airless world. They\nflew across to the pyramid and looked for some means of entrance. In\nseveral places, they noticed hieroglyphics carved in great, foot-high\ncharacters. They searched in vain for a door until they noticed that the\npyramid was not perfect, but truncated, leaving a flat area on top. The\nonly joint in the walls seemed to be there, but there was no handle or\nvisible methods of opening the door.\n\nArcot turned his powerful light on the surface and searched carefully\nfor some opening device. He found a bas-relief engraving of a hand\npointing to a corner of the door. He looked more closely and found a\nsmall jewel-like lens set in the metal.\n\nSuddenly the men felt a vibration! There was a heavy click, and the door\npanel began to drop slowly.\n\n\"Get on it!\" Arcot cried. \"We can always break our way out if we're\ntrapped!\"\n\nThe four men leaped on it and sank slowly with it. The massive walls of\nthe tower were nearly five feet thick, and made of some tough, white\nmetal.\n\n\"Pure iron!\" diagnosed Wade. \"Or perhaps a silicon-iron alloy. Not as\nstrong as steel, but very resistant to corrosion.\"\n\nWhen the elevator stopped, they found themselves in a great chamber that\nwas obviously a museum of the lost race. All around the walls were\narranged models, books, and diagrams.\n\n\"We can never hope to take all this in our ship!\" said Arcot, looking at\nthe great collection. \"Look--there's an old winged airplane! And a steam\nengine--and that's an electric motor! And that thing looks like some\nkind of an electric battery.\"\n\n\"But we can't take all that stuff,\" objected Fuller.\n\n\"No,\" Morey agreed. \"I think our best bet would be to take all the books\nwe can--making sure we get the introductory ones, so we can read the\nlanguage.\n\n\"See--over there--they have marked those shelves with a single vertical\nmark. The ones next to them have two vertical marks, and next ones\nthree. I suggest we load up with those books and take them to the ship.\"\n\nThe rest agreed, and they began carrying armloads of books, flying out\nthrough the top of the pyramid to the ship and back for more.\n\nInstead of flying back to the pyramid for the last load, Arcot announced\nthat he was going to leave a note for anyone who might come here later.\nWhile the others went back for the last load, he worked at drawing the\n\"note\".\n\n\"Let's see your masterpiece,\" said Morey as the three men returned to\nthe ship with the last of the books.\n\nArcot had used a piece of tough, heavy plastic which would resist any\ncorrosion the cold, almost airless world might have to offer.\n\nNear the top, he had drawn a representation of their ship, and beneath\nit a representation of the route they had taken from universe to\nuniverse. The galaxy they were in was represented by a cloud of gas, its\nmain identifying feature. Underneath the dotted line of their route\nthrough space, he had printed \"200,000,000,000, _u_\".\n\nThen followed a little table. The numeral \"1\" followed by a straight\nbar, then \"2\" followed by two bars, and so on up to ten. Ten was\nrepresented by ten bars and, in addition, an S-shaped sign. Twenty was\nnext, followed by twenty bars and two S-shaped signs. Thus he had\nworked up to \"100\".\n\nThe system he used would make it clear to any reasoning creature that he\nhad used a decimal system and that the zeroes meant ten times.\n\nNext below, he had drawn the planetary system of the frozen world, and\nthe distance from the planet they were on to the central sun he labeled\n\"_u_\". Thus, the finders could reason that they had come a distance of\ntwo hundred billion units, where a distance of three hundred million\nmiles was taken as the unit; they had, then, come from another galaxy.\nCertainly any creature with enough intelligence to reach this frozen\nworld would understand this!\n\n\"Since the year of this planet is approximately eight times our own,\"\nArcot continued, \"I am indicating that we came here approximately five\nhundred years after the catastrophe.\" He pointed at several of the other\ndrawings.\n\nThey left the message in the tower, and Arcot closed the door, leaving\nthe pyramid exactly as it had been before they had come.\n\n\"Say!\" Morey commented, \"how did you open and close that door, anyway?\"\n\nArcot grinned. \"Didn't you notice the jewel at the corner? It was the\nlens of a photoelectric cell. My flashlight opened the door. I didn't\nfigure it out; it just worked accidentally.\"\n\nMorey raised an eyebrow. \"But if the darned thing is so simple, any\ncreature, intelligent or not, might be able to get in and destroy the\nrecords!\"\n\nArcot looked at him. \"And where are your savages going to come from?\nThere are none on this planet, and anyone intelligent enough to build a\nspaceship isn't going to destroy the contents of the tower.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Morey looked a little sheepish.\n\nThey went into the airlock and took off their suits. Then they began\npacking the precious books in specimen cases that had been brought for\nthe purpose of preserving such things.\n\nWhen the last of them was carefully stowed, they returned to the\ncontrol room. They looked silently out across this strange, dead world,\nthinking how much it must have been like Earth. It was dead now, and\nfrozen forever. The low hills that stretched out beneath them were dimly\nlighted by the weak rays of a shrunken sun. Three hundred million miles\naway, it glowed so weakly that this world received only a little more\nheat than it might have received from a small coal fire a mile away.\n\nSo weakly it flared that in this thin atmosphere of hydrogen and helium,\nits little corona glowed about it plainly, and even the stars around it\nshone brilliantly. The men could see one constellation that grouped\nitself in the outlines of a dragon, with the sun of this system as its\ncold, baleful eye.\n\nGradually, Arcot lifted the ship, and, as they headed out into space,\nthey could see the dim frozen plains fall behind. It was as if a load of\noppressing loneliness parted from them as they flew out into the vast\nspaces of the eternal stars.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nArcot looked speculatively at the star field in the great broad window\nbefore him. \"We'll want to find another G-0 sun, naturally, but I don't\nthink we ought to go directly from here. If we did, we'd have to do a\nlot of backtracking to get back to this dead star. I suggest we go back\nto the edge of this galaxy, taking pictures on the way out, so that any\nfuture investigators can come in directly. It'll only take a few hours.\"\n\n\"I think you're right,\" agreed Morey. \"Besides, that will give us a\nwider choice of stars to pick our next G-0 from. Let's get going.\"\n\nArcot moved the red switch, and the ship shot away at half speed. They\nwatched the green image of the white dwarf fade and then suddenly flare\nup and become bright again as they outraced the light that had left it\nfive centuries before.\n\nThey stopped and took more photographs so that the path could be marked.\nThey stopped every light century until they reached a point where the\nstar was merely a dim point, almost lost in the myriad of stars around\nit.\n\nThen out to the edge of the galaxy they went, out toward their own\nuniverse.\n\n\"Arcot,\" Morey called, \"let's go out, say one million light years into\nspace, at an angle to this galaxy, and see if we can get both galaxies\non one plate. It will make navigation between them easier.\"\n\n\"Good idea. We can get out and back in one day--and this 'time' won't\ncount back on Earth, anyway.\" Since they would travel in the\nspace-strain all the time, it would not count as Earth time.\n\nArcot pushed the red control all the way forward, and the ship began to\nmove at its top velocity of twenty-four light years per second. The\nhours dragged heavily, as they had when they were coming in, and Arcot\nremained alone on watch while the others went to their rooms for some\nsleep, strapping their weightless bodies securely in the bunks.\n\nIt was hours later when Morey awoke with a sudden premonition of\ntrouble. He looked at the chronometer on the wall--he had slept twelve\nhours! They had gone beyond the million light year mark! It didn't\nmatter, except it showed that something had happened to Arcot.\n\nSomething had. Arcot was sound asleep in the middle of the\nlibrary--exactly in the middle, floating in the room ten feet from each\nwall.\n\nMorey called out to him, and Arcot awoke with a guilty start. \"A fine\nsentry you make,\" said Morey caustically. \"Can't even keep awake when\nall you have to do is sit here and see that we don't run into anything.\nWe've gone more than our million light years already, and we're still\ngoing strong. Come on--snap out of it!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry--I apologize--I know I shouldn't have slept, but it was so\nperfectly quiet here except for your deep-toned, musical snores that I\ncouldn't help it,\" grinned Arcot. \"Get me down from here and we'll\nstop.\"\n\n\"Get you down, nothing!\" Morey snapped. \"You stay right there while I\ncall the others and we decide what's to be done with a sleeping sentry.\"\n\nMorey turned and left to wake the others.\n\nHe had awakened Wade and told him what had happened, and they were on\ntheir way to wake up Fuller, when suddenly the air of the ship crackled\naround them! The space was changing! They were coming out of hyperspace!\n\nIn amazement, Morey and Wade looked at each other. They knew that Arcot\nwas still floating helplessly in the middle of the room, but--\n\n\"Hold on, you brainless apes! We're turning around!\" came Arcot's voice,\nfull of suppressed mirth.\n\nSuddenly they were both plastered against the wall of the ship under\nfour gravities of acceleration! Unable to walk, they could only crawl\nlaboriously toward the control room, calling to Arcot to shut off the\npower.\n\nWhen Morey had left him stranded in the library, Arcot had decided it\nwas high time he got to the floor. Quickly, he looked around for a means\nof doing so. Near him, floating in the air, was the book he had been\nreading, but it was out of reach. He had taken off his boots when he\nstarted to read, so the Fuller rocket method was out. It seemed\nhopeless.\n\nThen, suddenly, came the inspiration! Quickly, he slipped off his shirt\nand began waving it violently in the air. He developed a velocity of\nabout two inches a second--not very fast, but fast enough. By the time\nhe had put his shirt back on, he had reached the wall.\n\nAfter that, it was easy to shoot himself over to the door, out into the\ncorridor and into the control room without being seen by Morey, who was\nin Wade's room.\n\nJust as Wade and Morey reached the doorway to the control room, Arcot\ndecided it was time to shut the power off. Both of the men, laboring\nunder more than eight hundred pounds of weight, were suddenly\nweightless. All the strength of their powerful muscles were expended in\nhurling them against the far wall.\n\nThe complaints were loud, but they finally simmered down to an earnest\ndemand to know how in the devil Arcot had managed to get off dead\ncenter.\n\n\"Why, that was easy,\" he said airily. \"I just turned on a little power;\nI fell under the influence of the weight and then it was easy to get to\nthe control room.\"\n\n\"Come on,\" Wade demanded. \"The truth! How did you get here?\"\n\n\"Why, I just pushed myself here.\"\n\n\"Yes; no doubt. But how did you get hold of anything to push?\"\n\n\"I just took a handful of air and threw it away and reached the wall.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course--and how did you hold the air?\"\n\n\"I just took some air and threw it away and reached the wall.\"\n\nWhich was all they could learn. Arcot was going to keep his system\nsecret, it seemed.\n\n\"At any rate,\" Arcot continued, \"I am back in the control room, where I\nbelong, and you are not in the observatory where you belong. Now get out\nof my territory!\"\n\nMorey pushed himself back to the observatory, and after a few minutes,\nhis voice came over the intercom. \"Let's move on a bit more, Arcot. We\nstill can't get both galaxies on the same plate. Let's go on for another\nhour and take our pictures from that point.\"\n\nFuller had awakened and come in in the meantime, and he wanted to know\nwhy they didn't take some pictures from this spot.\n\n\"No point in it,\" said Morey. \"We have the ones we took coming in; what\nwe want is a wide-angle shot.\"\n\nArcot threw on the space-strain drive once more, and they headed on at\ntop speed.\n\nThey were all in the control room, watching the instruments and\njoking--principally the latter--when it happened. One instant they were\nmoving smoothly, weightlessly along. The next instant, the ship rocked\nas though it had been struck violently! The air was a snapping inferno\nof shooting sparks, and there came the sharp crash of the suddenly\nvolatilized silver bar that was their main power fuse. Simultaneously,\nthey were hurled forward with terrific force; the straps that held them\nin place creaked with the sudden strain, and the men felt weak and\nfaint.\n\nConsciousness nearly left them; they had been burned in a dozen places\nby the leaping sparks.\n\nThen it was over. Except that the ghost ships no longer followed them,\nthe _Ancient Mariner_ seemed unchanged. Around them, they could see the\ndim glowing of the galaxies.\n\n\"Brother! We came near something!\" Arcot cried. \"It may be a wandering\nstar! Take a look around, quick!\"\n\nBut the dark of space seemed utterly empty around them as they coasted\nweightless through space. Then Arcot snapped off the lights of the\ncontrol room, and in a moment his eyes had become accustomed to the dim\nlights.\n\nIt was dead ahead of them. It was a dull red glow, so dim it was\nscarcely visible. Arcot realized it was a dead star.\n\n\"There it is, Morey!\" he said. \"A dead star, directly ahead of us! Good\nGod, how close are we?\"\n\nThey were falling straight toward the dim red bulk.\n\n\"How far are we from it?\" Fuller asked.\n\n\"At least several million--\" Morey began. Then he looked at the distance\nrecorded on the meteor detector. \"ARCOT! FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE DO SOMETHING!\nTHAT THING IS ONLY A FEW HUNDRED MILES AWAY!\"\n\n\"There's only one thing to do,\" Arcot said tightly. \"We can never hope\nto avoid that thing; we haven't got the power. I'm going to try for an\norbit around it. We'll fall toward it and give the ship all the\nacceleration she'll take. There's no time to calculate--I'll just pile\non the speed until we don't fall into it.\"\n\nThe others, strapped into the control chairs, prepared themselves for\nthe acceleration to come.\n\nIf the _Ancient Mariner_ had dropped toward the star from an infinite\ndistance, Arcot could have applied enough power to put the ship in a\nhyperbolic orbit which would have carried them past the star. But they\nhad come in on the space drive, and had gotten fairly close before the\ngravitational field had drained the power from the main coil, and it was\nnot until the space field had broken that they had started to accelerate\ntoward the star. Their velocity would not be great enough to form an\nescape orbit.\n\nEven now, they would fall far short of enough velocity to get into an\nelliptical orbit unless they used the molecular drive.\n\nArcot headed toward one edge of the star, and poured power into the\nmolecular drive. The ship shot forward under an additional five and a\nhalf gravities of acceleration. Their velocity had been five thousand\nmiles per second when they entered hyperspace, and they were swiftly\nadding to their original velocity.\n\nThey did not, of course, feel the pull of the sun, since they were in\nfree fall in its field; they could only feel the five and a half\ngravities of the molecular drive. Had they been able to experience the\npull of the star, they would have been crushed by their own weight.\n\nTheir speed was mounting as they drew nearer to the star, and Arcot was\nforcing the ship on with all the additional power he could get. But he\nknew that the only hope they had was to get the ship in a closed ellipse\naround the star, and a closed ellipse meant that they would be forever\nbound to the star as a planet! Helpless, for not even the titanic power\nof the _Ancient Mariner_ could enable them to escape!\n\nAs the dull red of the dead sun ballooned toward them, Arcot said: \"I\nthink we'll make an orbit, all right, but we're going to be awfully\nclose to the surface of that thing!\"\n\nThe others were quiet; they merely watched Arcot and the star as Arcot\nmade swift movements with the controls, doing all he could to establish\nthem in an orbit that would be fairly safe.\n\nIt seemed like an eternity--five and a half gravities of acceleration\nheld the men in their chairs almost as well as the straps of the\nantiacceleration units that bound them. When a man weighs better than\nhalf a ton, he doesn't feel like moving much.\n\nFuller whispered to Morey out of the corner of his sagging mouth. \"What\non Earth--I mean, what in Space is that thing? We're within only a few\nhundred miles, you said, so it must be pretty small. How could it pull\nus around like this?\"\n\n\"It's a dead white dwarf--a 'black dwarf', you might say,\" Morey\nreplied. \"As the density of such matter increases, the volume of the\nstar depends less and less on its temperature. In a dwarf with the mass\nof the sun, the temperature effect is negligible; it's the action of the\nforces within the electron-nucleon gas which makes up the star that\nreigns supreme.\n\n\"It's been shown that if a white dwarf--or a black one--is increased in\nmass, it begins to decrease sharply in volume after a certain point is\nreached. In fact, no _cold_ star can exist with a volume greater than\nabout one and a half times the mass of the sun--as the mass increases\nand the pressure goes up, the star shrinks in volume because of the\ndegenerate matter in it. At a little better than 1.4 times the mass of\nthe sun--our sun, I mean: Old Sol--the star would theoretically collapse\nto a point.\n\n\"That has almost happened in this case. The actual limit is when the\nstar has reached the density of a neutron, and this star hasn't\ncollapsed that far by a long shot.\n\n\"But that star is only forty kilometers--_or less than twenty-five\nmiles_ in diameter!\"\n\nIt took nearly two hours of careful juggling to get an orbit which\nArcot considered reasonably circular.\n\nAnd when they finally did, Wade looked at the sky above them and\nshouted: \"Say, look! What are all those streaks?\"\n\nArcing up from the surface of the dull red plain below them and going\nover the ship, were several dim streaks of light across the sky. One of\nthem was brighter than the rest, a bright white streak. The streaks\ndidn't move; they seemed to have been painted on the sky overhead,\nglowing bands of unwavering light.\n\n\"Those,\" said Arcot, \"are the nebulae. That wide streak is the one we\njust left. The bright streak must be a nearby star.\n\n\"They look like streaks because we're moving so fast in so small an\norbit.\" He pointed to the red star beneath them. \"We're less than twenty\nmiles from the center of that thing! We're almost exactly thirty\nkilometers from its center, or about ten kilometers from its surface!\nBut, because of it's great mass, our orbital velocity is something\nterrific!\n\n\"We're going around that thing better than three hundred times every\nsecond; our 'year' is three milliseconds long! Our orbital velocity is\n_seven hundred thousand kilometers per second_!\n\n\"We're moving along at about a fifth of the speed of light!\"\n\n\"Are we safe in this orbit?\" Fuller asked.\n\n\"Safe enough,\" said Arcot bitterly. \"So damned safe that I don't see how\nwe'll ever break free. We can't pull away with all the power on this\nship. We're trapped!\n\n\"Well, I'm worn out from working under all that gravity; let's eat and\nget some sleep.\"\n\n\"I don't feel like sleeping,\" said Fuller. \"You may call this safe, but\nit would only take an instant to fall down to the surface of that thing\nthere.\" He looked down at their inert, but titanically powerful enemy\nwhose baleful glow seemed even now to be burning their funeral pyre.\n\n\"Well,\" said Arcot, \"falling into it and flying off into space are two\nthings you don't have to worry about. If we started toward it, we'd be\nfalling, and our velocity would increase; as a result, we'd bounce right\nback out again. The magnitude of the force required to make us fall into\nthat sun is appalling! The gravitational pull on us now amounts to about\nfive _billion_ tons, which is equalized by the centrifugal force of our\norbital velocity. Any tendency to change it would be like trying to bend\na spring with that much resistance.\n\n\"We'd require a tremendous force to make us either fall into that\nstar--or get away from it.\n\n\"To escape, we have to lift this ship out against gravity. That means\nwe'd have to lift about five million tons of mass. As we get farther\nout, our weight will decrease as the gravitational attraction drops off,\nbut we would need such vast amounts of energy that they are beyond human\nconception.\n\n\"We have burned up two tons of matter recharging the coils, and are now\nusing another two tons to recharge them again. We need at least four\ntons to spare, and we only started out with twenty. We simply haven't\ngot fuel enough to break loose from this star's gravitational hold, vast\nas the energy of matter is. Let's eat, and then we can sleep on the\nproblem.\"\n\nWade cooked a meal for them, and they ate in silence, trying to think of\nsome way out of their dilemma. Then they tried to sleep on the problem,\nas Arcot had suggested, but it was difficult to relax. They were\nphysically tired; they had gone through such great strains, even in the\nshort time that they had been maneuvering, that they were very tired.\n\nUnder a pull five times greater than normal gravity, they had tired in\none-fifth the time they would have at one gravity, but their brains were\nstill wide awake, trying to think of some way--_any way_--to get away\nfrom the dark sun.\n\nBut at last sleep came.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nMorey thought he was the first to waken when, seven hours later, he\ndressed and dove lightly, noiselessly, out into the library. Suddenly,\nhe noticed that the telectroscope was in operation--he heard the low hum\nof its smoothly working director motors.\n\nHe turned and headed back toward the observatory. Arcot was busy with\nthe telectroscope.\n\n\"What's up, Arcot?\" he demanded.\n\nArcot looked up at him and dusted off his hands. \"I've just been\ngimmicking up the telectroscope. We're going around this dead dwarf once\nevery three milliseconds, which makes it awfully hard to see the stars\naround us. So I put in a cutoff which will shut the telectroscope off\nmost of the time; it only looks at the sky once every three\nmilliseconds. As a result, we can get a picture of what's going on\naround us very easily. It won't be a steady picture, but since we're\ngetting a still picture three hundred times a second, it will be better\nthan any moving picture film ever projected as far as accuracy is\nconcerned.\n\n\"I did it because I want to take a look at that bright streak in the\nsky. I think it'll be the means to our salvation--if there is any.\"\n\nMorey nodded. \"I see what you mean; if that's another white dwarf--which\nit most likely is--we can use it to escape. I think I see what you're\ndriving at.\"\n\n\"If it doesn't work,\" Arcot said coolly, \"we can profit by the example\nof the people we left back there. Suicide is preferable to dying of\ncold.\"\n\nMorey nodded. \"The question is: How helpless are we?\"\n\n\"Depends entirely on that star; let's see if we can get a focus on it.\"\n\nAt the orbital velocity of the ship, focussing on the star was indeed a\ndifficult thing to do. It took them well over an hour to get the image\ncentered in the screen without its drifting off toward one edge; it took\neven longer to get the focus close enough to a sphere to give them a\ndefinite reading on the instruments. The image had started out as a\nstreak, but by taking smaller and smaller sections of the streak at the\nproper times, they managed to get a good, solid image. But to get it\nbright enough was another problem; they were only picking up a fraction\nof the light, and it had to be amplified greatly to make a visible\nimage.\n\nWhen they finally got what they were looking for, Morey gazed steadily\nat the image. \"Now the job is to figure the distance. And we haven't got\nmuch parallax to work with.\"\n\n\"If we compute in the timing in our blinker system at opposite sides of\nthe orbit, I think we can do it,\" Arcot said.\n\nThey went to work on the problem. When Fuller and Wade showed up, they\nwere given work to do--Morey gave them equations to solve without\ntelling them to what the figures applied.\n\nFinally Arcot said: \"Their period about the common center of gravity is\nthirty-nine hours, as I figure it.\"\n\nMorey nodded. \"Check. And that gives us a distance of two million miles\napart.\"\n\n\"Just what are you two up to?\" asked Fuller. \"What good is another star?\nThe one we're interested in is this freak underneath us.\"\n\n\"No,\" Arcot corrected, \"we're interested in getting _away_ from the one\nbeneath us, which is an entirely different matter. If we were midway\nbetween this star and that one, the gravitational effects of the two\nwould be cancelled out, since we would be pulled as hard in one\ndirection as the other. Then we'd be free of both pulls and could\nescape!\n\n\"If we could get into that neutral area long enough to turn on our space\nstrain drive, we could get away between them fast. Of course, a lot of\nour energy would be eaten up, but we'd get away.\n\n\"That's our only hope,\" Arcot concluded.\n\n\"Yes, and what a whale of a hope it is,\" Wade snorted sarcastically.\n\"How are you going to get out to a point halfway between these two stars\nwhen you don't have enough power to lift this ship a few miles?\"\n\n\"If Mahomet can not go to the mountain,\" misquoted Arcot, \"then the\nmountain must come to Mahomet.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" Wade asked in exasperation. \"Beat Joshua? He\nmade the sun stand still, but this is a job of throwing them around!\"\n\n\"It is,\" agreed Arcot quietly, \"and I intend to throw that star in such\na way that we can escape between the twin fields! We can escape between\nthe hammer and the anvil as millions of millions of millions of tons of\nmatter crash into each other.\"\n\n\"And you intend to swing that?\" asked Wade in awe as he thought of the\nspectacle there would be when two suns fell into each other. \"Well, I\ndon't want to be around.\"\n\n\"You haven't any choice,\" Arcot grinned. Then his face grew serious.\n\"What I want to do is simple. We have the molecular ray. Those stars are\nhot. They don't fall into each other because they are rotating about\neach other. Suppose that rotation were stopped--stopped suddenly and\ncompletely? The molecular ray acts catalytically; we won't supply the\npower to stop that star, the star itself will. All we have to do is\ncause the molecules to move in a direction opposite to the rotation.\nWe'll supply the impulse, and the star will supply the energy!\n\n\"Our job will be to break away when the stars get close enough; we are\nreally going to hitch our wagon to a star!\n\n\"The mechanics of the job are simple. We will have to calculate when and\nhow long to use the power, and when and how quickly to escape. We'll\nhave to use the main power board to generate the ray and project it\ninstead of the little ray units. With luck, we ought to be free of this\nstar in three days!\"\n\nWork was started at once. They had a chance of life in sight, and they\nhad every intention of taking advantage of it! The calculating machines\nthey had brought would certainly prove worth their mass in this one use.\nThe observations were extremely difficult because the ship was rocketing\naround the star in such a rapid orbit. The calculations of the mass and\ndistance and orbital motion of the other star were therefore very\ndifficult, but the final results looked good.\n\nThe other star and this one formed a binary, the two being of only\nslightly different mass and rotating about each other at a distance of\nroughly two million miles.\n\nThe next problem was to calculate the time of fall from that point,\nassuming that it would stop instantaneously, which would be\napproximately true.\n\nThe actual fall would take only seven hours under the tremendous\nacceleration of the two masses! Since the stars would fall toward each\nother, the ship would be drawn toward the falling mass, and since their\norbit around the star took only a fraction of a second to complete, they\nhad to make sure they were in the right position at the halfway point\njust before collision occurred. Also, their orbit would be greatly\nperturbed as the star approached, and it was necessary to calculate that\nin, too.\n\nArcot calculated that in twenty-two hours, forty-six minutes, they would\nbe in the most favorable position to start the fall. They could have\nstarted sooner, but there were some changes that had to be made in the\nwiring of the ship before they could start using the molecular ray at\nfull power.\n\n\"Well,\" said Wade as he finally finished the laborious computations, \"I\nhope we don't make a mistake and get caught between the two! And what\nhappens if we find we haven't stopped the star after all?\"\n\n\"If we don't hit it exactly the first time,\" Morley replied, \"we'll have\nto juggle the ray until we do.\"\n\nThey set to work at once, installing the heavy leads to the ray\nprojectors, which were on the outside of the hull in countersunk\nrecesses. Morey and Wade had to go outside the ship to help attach the\ncables.\n\nOut in space, floating about the ship, they were still weightless, for\nthey, too, were supported by centrifugal force.\n\nThe work of readjusting the projectors for greater power was completed\nin an hour and a quarter, which still left over twenty hours before they\ncould use them. During the next ten hours, they charged the great\nstorage coils to capacity, leaving the circuits to them open, controlled\nby the relays only. That would keep the coils charged, ready to start.\n\nFinally, Wade dusted off his hands and said: \"We're all ready to go\nmechanically, and I think it would be wise if we were ready physically,\ntoo. I know we're not very tired, but if we sit around in suspense we'll\nbe as nervous as cats when the time comes. I suggest we take a couple of\nsleeping tablets and turn in. If we use a mild shock to awaken us, we\nwon't oversleep.\"\n\nThe others agreed to the plan and prepared for their wait.\n\nAwakened two hours before the actual moment of action, Wade prepared\nbreakfast, and Morey took observations. He knew just where the star\nshould be according to their calculations, and looked for it there. He\nbreathed a sigh of relief--it was exactly in place! Their mathematics\nthey had been sure of, but on such a rapidly moving machine, it was\nexceedingly difficult to make good observations.\n\nThe two hours seemed to drag interminably, but at last Arcot signalled\nfor the full power of the molecular rays. They waited, breathlessly, for\nsome response. Nearly twenty seconds later, the other sun went out.\n\n\"We did it!\" said Wade in a hushed voice. It was almost a shock to\nrealize that this ship had power enough to extinguish a sun!\n\nArcot and Morey weren't awed; they didn't have time. There were other\nthings to do and do fast.\n\nThey had checked the time required for them to see that the white dwarf\nhad gone out. Half of this gave them the distance from the star in light\nseconds.\n\nThe screen had already been rigged to flash the information into a\ncomputer, which in turn gave a time signal to the robot pilot that would\nturn on the drive at precisely the right instant. There was no time for\nhuman error here; the velocities were too great and the time for error\ntoo small.\n\nThen they waited. They had to wait for seven hours spinning dizzily\naround an improbably tiny star with an equally improbably titanic\ngravitational field. A star only a couple of dozens of miles across, and\nyet so dense that it weighed half a million times as much as the Earth!\nAnd they had to wait while another star like it, chilled now to absolute\nzero, fell toward them!\n\n\"I wish we could stay around to see the splash,\" Arcot said. \"It's going\nto be something to see. All the kinetic energy of those two masses\nslamming into each other is going to be a blaze of light that will\nreally be something!\"\n\nWade was looking nervously at the telectroscope plate. \"I wish we could\nsee that other sun. I don't like the idea of a thing that big creeping\nup on us in the dark.\"\n\n\"Calm down,\" Morey said quietly. \"It's out of our hands now; we took a\nchance, and it was a chance we _had_ to take. If you want to watch\nsomething, watch Junior down there. It's going to start doing some\npretty interesting tricks.\"\n\nAs the dense black sun approached them, Junior, as Morey had called it,\ndid begin to do tricks. At first they seemed to be optical effects, as\nthough the eye itself were playing tricks. The red, glowing ball beneath\nthem began to grow transparent around its surface, leaving an opaque red\ncore which seemed to be shrinking slowly.\n\n\"What's happening?\" Fuller asked.\n\n\"Our orbit around the star is becoming more and more elliptical,\" Arcot\nreplied. \"As the other sun pulls us, the star beneath us grows smaller\nwith the distance; then, as we begin to fall back toward it, it grows\nlarger again. Since this is taking place many hundreds of times per\nsecond, the visual pictures all seem to blend in together.\"\n\n\"Watch the clock,\" Morey said suddenly, pointing.\n\nThe men watched tensely as the hand moved slowly around.\n\n\"Ten--nine--eight--seven--six--five--four--three--two--one--ZERO!\"\n\nA relay slammed home, and almost instantaneously, everyone on the ship\nwas slammed into unconsciousness.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nHours later, Arcot regained consciousness. It was quiet in the ship. He\nwas still strapped in his seat in the control room. The relux screens\nwere in place, and all was perfectly peaceful. He didn't know whether\nthe ship was motionless or racing through space at a speed faster than\nlight, and his first semiconscious impulse was to see.\n\nHe reached out with an arm that seemed to be made of dry dust, ready to\ncrumble; an arm that would not behave. His nerves were jumping wildly.\nHe pulled the switch he was seeking, and the relux screens dropped down\nas the motors pulled them back.\n\nThey were in hyperspace; beside them rode the twin ghost ships.\n\nArcot looked around, trying to decide what to do, but his brain was\nclogged. He felt tired; he wanted to sleep. Scarcely able to think, he\ndragged the others to their rooms and strapped them in their bunks. Then\nhe strapped himself in and fell asleep almost at once.\n\nStill more hours passed, then Arcot was waking slowly to insistent\nshaking by Morey.\n\n\"Hey! Arcot! Wake up! ARCOT! HEY!\"\n\nArcot's ears sent the message to his brain, but his brain tried to\nignore it. At last he slowly opened his eyes.\n\n\"Huh?\" he said in a low, tired voice.\n\n\"Thank God! I didn't know whether you were alive or not. None of us\nremembered going to bed. We decided you must have carried us there, but\nyou sure looked dead.\"\n\n\"Uhuh?\" came Arcot's unenthusiastic rejoinder.\n\n\"Boy, is he sleepy!\" said Wade as he drifted into the room. \"Use a wet\ncloth and some cold water, Morey.\"\n\nA brisk application of cold water brought Arcot more nearly awake. He\nimmediately clamored for the wherewithal to fill an aching void that was\nmaking itself painfully felt in his midsection.\n\n\"He's all right!\" laughed Wade. \"His appetite is just as healthy as\never!\"\n\nThey had already prepared a meal, and Arcot was promptly hustled to the\ngalley. He strapped himself into the chair so that he could eat\ncomfortably, and then looked around at the others. \"Where the devil are\nwe?\"\n\n\"That,\" replied Morey seriously, \"was just what we wanted to ask you. We\nhaven't the beginnings of an idea. We slept for two days, all told, and\nby now we're so far from all the Island Universes that we can't tell one\nfrom another. We have no idea where we are.\n\n\"I've stopped the ship; we're just floating. I'm sure I don't know what\nhappened, but I hoped you might have an idea.\"\n\n\"I have an idea,\" said Arcot. \"I'm hungry! You wait until after I've\neaten, and I'll talk.\" He fell to on the food.\n\nAfter eating, he went to the control room and found that every gyroscope\nin the place had been thrown out of place by the attractions they had\npassed through. He looked around at the meters and coils.\n\nIt was obvious what had happened. Their attempt to escape had been\nsuccessful; they had shot out between the stars, into the space. The\nenergy had been drained from the power coil, as they had expected. Then\nthe power plant had automatically cut in, recharging the coils in two\nhours. Then the drive had come on again, and the ship had flashed on\ninto space. But with the gyroscopes as erratic as they were, there was\nno way of knowing which direction they had come; they were lost in\nspace!\n\n\"Well, there are lots of galaxies we can go to,\" said Arcot. \"We ought\nto be able to find a nice one and stay there if we can't get home\nagain.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Wade replied, \"but I like Earth! If only we hadn't all passed\nout! What caused that, Arcot?\"\n\nArcot shrugged. \"I'm sure I don't know. My only theory is that the\ndouble gravitational field, plus our own power field, produced a sort of\ncross-product that effected our brains.\n\n\"At any rate, here we are.\"\n\n\"We certainly are,\" agreed Morey. \"We can't possibly back track; what we\nhave to do is identify our own universe. What identifying features does\nit have that will enable us to recognize it?\n\n\"Our Galaxy has two 'satellites', the Greater and Lesser Magellanic\nClouds. If we spent ten years photographing and studying and comparing\nwith the photographs we already have, we might find it. We know that\nsystem will locate the Galaxy, but we haven't the time. Any other\nsuggestions?\"\n\n\"We came out here to visit planets, didn't we?\" asked Arcot. \"Here's our\nchance--and our only chance--of getting home, as far as I can see. We\ncan go to any galaxy in the neighborhood--within twenty or thirty\nmillion light years--and look for a planet with a high degree of\ncivilization.\n\n\"Then we'll give them the photographs we have, and ask them if they've\nany knowledge of a galaxy with two such satellites. We just keep trying\nuntil we find a race which has learned through their research. I think\nthat's the easiest, quickest, and most satisfactory method. What do you\nthink?\"\n\nIt was the obvious choice, and they all agreed. The next proposition was\nto select a galaxy.\n\n\"We can go to any one we wish,\" said Morey, \"but we're now moving at\nthirty thousand miles per second; it would take us quite a while to slow\ndown, stop, and go in the other direction. There's a nice, big galactic\nnebula right in front of us, about three days away--six million light\nyears. Any objections to heading for that?\"\n\nThe rest looked at the glowing point of the nebula. Out in space, a star\nis a hard, brilliant, dimensionless point of light. But a nebula glows\nwith a faint mistiness; they are so far away that they never have any\nbright glow, such as stars have, but they are so vast, their dimensions\nso great, that even across millions of light years of space they appear\nas tiny glowing discs with faint, indistinct edges. As the men looked\nout of the clear lux metal windows, they saw the tiny blur of light on\nthe soft black curtain of space.\n\nIt was as good a course as any, and the ship's own inertia recommended\nit; they had only to redirect the ship with greater accuracy.\n\nSetting the damaged gyroscopes came first, however. There were a number\nof things about the ship that needed readjustment and replacement after\nthe strain of escaping from the giant star.\n\nAfter they had made a thorough inspection Arcot said:\n\n\"I think we'd best make all our repairs out here. That flame that hit us\nburned off our outside microphone and speaker, and probably did a lot of\ndamage to the ray projectors. I'd rather not land on a planet unarmed;\nthe chances are about fifty-fifty that we'd be greeted with open cannon\nmuzzles instead of open arms.\"\n\nThe work inside was left to Arcot and Fuller, while Morey and Wade put\non spacesuits and went out onto the hull.\n\nThey found surprisingly little damage--far less than they had expected.\nTrue, the loudspeaker, the microphone, and all other instruments made of\nordinary matter had been burned off clean. They didn't even have to\nclean out the spaces where they had been recessed into the wall. At a\ntemperature of ten thousand degrees, the metals had all boiled\naway--even tungsten boils at seven thousand degrees, and all other\nnormal matter boils even more easily.\n\nThe ray projectors, which had been adjusted for the high power necessary\nto stop a sun in its orbit, were readjusted for normal power, and the\nheat beams were replaced.\n\nAfter nearly four hours work, everything had been checked, from relays\nand switch points to the instruments and gyroscopes. Stock had been\ntaken, and they found they were running low on replacement parts. If\nanything more happened, they would have to stop using some of the\nmachinery and break it up for spare parts. Of their original supply of\ntwenty tons of lead fuel, only ten tons of the metal were left, but lead\nwas a common metal which they could easily pick up on any planet they\nmight visit. They could also get a fresh supply of water and refill\ntheir air tanks there.\n\nThe ship was in as perfect condition as it had ever been, for every\nbearing had been put in condition and the generators and gyroscopes were\nrunning smoothly.\n\nThey threw the ship into full speed and headed for the galaxy ahead of\nthem.\n\n\"We are going to look for intelligent beings,\" Arcot reminded the\nothers, \"so we'll have to communicate with them. I suggest we all\npractice the telepathic processes I showed you--we'll need them.\"\n\nThe time passed rapidly with something to do. They spent a considerable\npart of it reading the books on telepathy that Arcot had brought, and on\npracticing it with each other.\n\nBy the end of the second day of the trip, Morey and Fuller, who had\npeculiarly adaptable minds, were able to converse readily and rapidly,\nFuller doing the projecting and Morey the receiving. Wade had divided\nhis time about equally between projecting and reading, with the result\nthat he could do neither well.\n\nEarly on the fourth day, they entered the universe toward which they\nwere heading. They had stopped at about half a million light years and\ndecided that a large local cluster of very brilliant suns promised the\nbest results, since the stars were closer together there, and there were\nmany of the yellow G-0 type for which they were seeking.\n\nThey had penetrated into the galaxy as far as was safe, using half\nspeed; then, at lower speeds, they worked toward the local cluster.\n\nArcot cut the drive several light years from the nearest sun. \"Well,\nwe're where we wanted to be; now what do we do? Morey, pick us out a G-0\nstar. We await your royal command to move.\"\n\nAfter a few minutes at the telectroscope, Morey pointed to one of the\npinpoints of light that gleamed brightly in the sky. \"That one looks\nlike our best bet. It's a G-0 a little brighter than Sol.\"\n\nMorey swung the ship about, pointing the axis of the ship in the same\ndirection as its line of flight. The observatory had been leading, but\nnow the ship was turned to its normal position.\n\nThey shot forward, using the space-strain drive, for a full hour at\none-sixteenth power. Then Arcot cut the drive, and the disc of the sun\nwas large before them.\n\n\"We're going to have a job cutting down our velocity; we're traveling\npretty fast, relative to that sun,\" Arcot told the others. Their\nvelocity was so great that the sun didn't seem to swerve them greatly as\nthey rushed nearer. Arcot began to use the molecular drive to brake the\nship.\n\nMorey was busy with the telectroscope, although greatly hampered by the\nfact that it was a feat of strength to hold his arm out at right angles\nto his body for ten seconds under the heavy acceleration Arcot was\napplying.\n\n\"This method works!\" called Morey suddenly. \"The Fuller System For\nFinding Planets has picked another winner! Circle the sun so that I can\nget a better look!\"\n\nArcot was already trying vainly to decrease their velocity to a figure\nthat would permit the attraction of the sun to hold them in its grip and\nallow them to land on a planet.\n\n\"As I figure it,\" Arcot said, \"we'll need plenty of time to come to\nrest. What do you think, Morey?\"\n\nMorey punched figures into the calculator. \"Wow! Somewhere in the\nneighborhood of a hundred days, using all the acceleration that will be\nsafe! At five gravities, reducing our present velocity of twenty-five\nthousand miles per second to zero will take approximately twenty-four\nhundred hours--one hundred days! We'll have to use the gravitational\nattraction of that sun to help us.\"\n\n\"We'll have to use the space control,\" said Arcot. \"If we move close to\nthe sun by the space control, all the energy of the fall will be used in\novercoming the space-strain coil's field, and thus prevent our falling.\nWhen we start to move away again, we will be climbing against that\ngravity, which will aid us in stopping. But even so, it will take us\nabout three days to stop. We wouldn't get anywhere using molecular\npower; that giant sun was just too damned generous with his energy of\nfall!\"\n\nThey started the cycles, and, as Arcot had predicted, they took a full\nthree days of constant slowing to accomplish their purpose, burning up\nnearly three tons of matter in doing so. They were constantly oppressed\nby a load of five gravities except for the short intervals when they\nstopped to eat and when they were moving in the space control field.\nEven in sleeping, they were forced to stand the load.\n\nThe massive sun was their principal and most effective brake. At no time\ndid they go more than a few dozen million miles from the primary, for\nthe more intense the gravity, the better effect they got.\n\nMorey divided his time between piloting the ship while Arcot rested, and\nobserving the system. By the end of the third day, he had made very\ncreditable progress with his map.\n\nHe had located only six planets, but he was certain there were others.\nFor the sake of simplicity, he had assumed circular orbits and\ncalculated their approximate orbital velocities from their distance from\nthe sun. He had determined the mass of the sun from direct weighings\naboard their ship. He soon had a fair diagram of the system constructed\nmathematically, and experimental observation showed it to be a very\nclose approximation.\n\nThe planets were rather more massive than those of Sol. The innermost\nplanet had a third again the diameter of Mercury and was four million\nmiles farther from the primary. He named it Hermes. The next one, which\nhe named Aphrodite, the Greek goddess corresponding to the Roman Venus,\nwas only a little larger than Venus and was some eight million miles\nfarther from its primary--seventy-five million miles from the central\nsun.\n\nThe next, which Morey called Terra, was very much like Earth. At a\ndistance of a hundred and twenty-four million miles from the sun, it\nmust have received almost the same amount of heat that Earth does, for\nthis sun was considerably brighter than Sol.\n\nTerra was eight thousand two hundred miles in diameter, with a fairly\nclear atmosphere and a varying albedo which indicated clouds in the\natmosphere. Morey had every reason to believe that it might be\ninhabited, but he had no proof because his photographs were consistently\npoor due to the glare of the sun.\n\nThe rest of the planets proved to be of little interest. In the place\nwhere, according to Bode's Law, another planet, corresponding to Mars,\nshould have been, there was only a belt of asteroids. Beyond this was\nstill another belt. And on the other side of the double asteroid belt\nwas the fourth planet, a fifty-thousand-mile-in-diameter methane-ammonia\ngiant which Morey named Zeus in honor of Jupiter.\n\nHe had picked up a couple of others on his plates, but he had not been\nable to tell anything about them as yet. In any case, the planets\nAphrodite and Terra were by far the most interesting.\n\n\"I think we picked the right angle to come into this system,\" said\nArcot, looking at Morey's photographs of the wide bands of asteroids.\nThey had come into the planetary group at right angles to the plane of\nthe ecliptic, which had allowed them to miss both asteroid belts.\n\nThey started moving toward the planet Terra, reaching their objective in\nless than three hours.\n\nThe globe beneath them was lit brightly, for they had approached it from\nthe daylight side. Below them, they could see wide, green plains and\ngently rolling mountains, and in a great cleft in one of the mountain\nranges was a shimmering lake of clearest blue.\n\nThe air of the planet screamed about them as they dropped down, and the\nroar in the loudspeaker grew to a mighty cataract of sound. Morey turned\ndown the volume.\n\nThe sparkling little lake passed beneath them as they shot on,\nseventy-five miles above the surface of the planet. When they had first\nentered the atmosphere, they had the impression of looking down on a\nvast, inverted bowl whose edge rested on a vast, smooth table of deep\nviolet velvet. But as they dropped and the violet became bluer and\nbluer, they experienced the strange optical illusion of \"flopping\" of\nthe scene. The bowl seemed to turn itself inside out, and they were\nlooking down at its inner surface.\n\nThey shot over a mountain range, and a vast plain spread out before\nthem. Here and there, in the far distance, they could see darker spots\ncaused by buckled geological strata.\n\nArcot swung the ship around, and they saw the vast horizon swing about\nthem as their sensation of \"down\" changed with the acceleration of the\nturn. They felt nearly weightless, for they were lifting again in a high\narc.\n\nArcot was heading back toward the mountains they had passed over. He\ndropped the ship again, and the foothills seemed to rise to meet them.\n\n\"I'm heading for that lake,\" Arcot explained. \"It seems absolutely\ndeserted, and there are some things we want to do. I haven't had any\ndecent exercise for the past two weeks, except for straining under high\ngravity. I want to do some swimming, and we need to distill some water\nfor drink; we need to refill the tanks in case of emergencies. If the\natmosphere contains oxygen, fine; if it doesn't, we can get it out of\nthe water by electrolysis.\n\n\"But I hope that air is good to breathe, because I've been wanting a\nswim and a sun bath for a long time!\"\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\n\nThe _Ancient Mariner_ hung high in the air, poised twenty-five miles\nabove the surface of the little lake. Wade, as chemist, tested the air\nwhile the others readied the distillation and air condensation\napparatus. By the time they had finished, Wade was ready with his\nreport.\n\n\"Air pressure about 20 psi at the surface; temperature around\nninety-five Fahrenheit. Composition: eighteen percent oxygen,\nseventy-five percent nitrogen, four-tenths of one percent carbon\ndioxide, residue--inert gasses. That's not including water vapor, of\nwhich there is a fair amount.\n\n\"I put a canary into the air, and the bird liked it, so I imagine it's\nquite safe except for bacteria, perhaps. Naturally, at this altitude the\nair is germ-free.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Morey, \"then we can take our swim and work without worrying\nabout spacesuits.\"\n\n\"Just a minute!\" Fuller objected. \"What about those germs Wade\nmentioned? If you think I'm going out in my shorts where some flock of\nbacteria can get at my tender anatomy, you've got another think coming!\"\n\n\"I wouldn't worry about it,\" Wade said. \"The chances of organisms\ndeveloping along the same evolutionary line is quite slim. We may find\nthe inhabitants of the same shape as those of another world, because the\nhuman body is fairly well constructed anatomically. The head is in a\nplace where it will be able to see over a wide area and it's in a safe\nplace. The hand is very useful and can be improved upon but little.\nTrue, the Venerians have a second thumb, but the principle is the same.\n\n\"But chemically, the bodies are probably very different. The people of\nVenus are widely different chemically; the bacteria that can make a\nVenerian deathly ill is killed the instant it enters our body, or else\nit starves to death because it can't find the kind of chemical food it\nneeds to live. And the same thing happens when a Venerian is attacked by\nan Earthly microorganism.\n\n\"Even on Earth, evolution has produced such widely varying types of life\nthat an organism that can feed on one is totally incapable of feeding on\nanother. You, for instance, couldn't catch tobacco mosaic virus, and the\ntobacco plant can't catch the measles virus.\n\n\"You couldn't expect a microorganism to evolve here that was capable of\nfeeding on Earth-type tissues; they would have starved to death long\nago.\"\n\n\"What about bigger animals?\" Fuller asked cautiously.\n\n\"That's different. You would probably be indigestible to an alien\ncarnivore, but he'd probably kill you first to find out. If he ate you,\nit might kill him in the end, but that would be small consolation.\nThat's why we're going to go out armed.\"\n\nArcot dropped the ship swiftly until they were hovering a bare hundred\nfeet over the waters of the lake. There was a little stream winding its\nway down the mountainside, and another which led the clear overflow\naway.\n\n\"I doubt if there's anything of great size in that lake,\" Arcot said\nslowly and thoughtfully. \"Still, even small fish might be deadly. Let's\nplay safe and remove all forms of life, bacterial and otherwise. A\nlittle touch of the molecular motion ray, greatly diffused, will do the\ntrick.\"\n\nSince the molecular ray directed the motion of the molecules of matter,\nit prevented chemical reactions from taking place, even when greatly\ndiffused; all the molecules tend to go in the same direction to such an\nextent that the delicate balance of chemical reactions that is life is\nupset. It is too delicate a thing to stand any power that upsets the\nreactions so violently. All things are killed instantly.\n\nAs the light haze of the ionized air below them glowed out in a huge\ncone, the water of the lake heaved and seemed to move in its depths, but\nthere was no great movement of the waters; they lost only a fraction of\ntheir weight. But every living thing in that lake died instantly.\n\nArcot turned the ship, and the shining hull glided softly over to one\nside of the lake where a little sandy beach invited them. There seemed\nno indication of intelligent life about.\n\nEach of them took a load of the supplies they had brought, and carried\nthem out under the shade of an immense pine-like tree--a gigantic column\nof wood that stretched far into the sky to lose its green leaves in a\nwaving sea of foliage. The mottled sunlight of the bright star above\nthem made them feel very much at home. Its color, intensity, and warmth\nwere all exactly the same as on Earth.\n\nEach of the men wore his power suit to aid in carrying the things they\nhad brought, for the gravity here was a bit higher than that of Earth.\nThe difference in air pressure was so little as to be scarcely\nnoticeable; they even adjusted the interior of the ship to it.\n\nThey had every intention of staying here for awhile. It was pleasant to\nlie in the warm sun once more; so pleasant that it became difficult to\nremember that they were countless trillions of long miles from their own\nhome planet. It was hard to realize that the warm, blazing star above\nthem was not Old Sol.\n\nArcot was carrying a load of food in a box. He had neutralized his\nweight until, load and all, he weighed about a hundred pounds. This was\nnecessary in order to permit him to drag a length of hose behind him\ntoward the water, so it could be used as an intake for the pumps.\n\nMorey, meanwhile, was having trouble. He had been carrying a load of\nassorted things to use--a few pneumatic pillows, a heavy iron pot for\nboiling the water, and a number of other things.\n\nHe reached his destination, having floated the hundred or so feet from\nthe ship by using his power suit. He forgot, momentarily, and dropped\nhis load. Immediately, he too began to \"drop\"--upward! He had a\nbuoyancy of around three hundred pounds, and a weight of only two fifty.\nIn dropping the load, the sudden release had caused the power unit to\njerk him upward, and somehow the controlling knob on the power pack was\ntorn loose.\n\nMorey shot up into the air, showing a fair rate of progress toward his\nlate abode--space! And he had no way to stop himself. His hand power\nunit was far too weak to overcome the pull of his power-pack, and he was\nrising faster and faster!\n\nHe realized that his friends could catch him, and laughingly called\ndown: \"Arcot! Help! I'm being kidnapped by my power suit! To the\nrescue!\"\n\nArcot looked up quickly at Morey's call and realized immediately that\nhis power control had come off. He knew there was twenty miles or so of\nbreathable air above, and long before Morey rose that far, he could\ncatch him in the _Ancient Mariner_, if necessary.\n\nHe turned on his own power suit, using a lift of a hundred pounds, which\ngave him double Morey's acceleration. Quickly he gathered speed that\nshot him up toward his helpless friend, and a moment later, he had\ncaught up with him and passed him. Then he shut off his power and\ndrifted to a halt before he began to drop again. As Morey rose toward\nhim, Arcot adjusted the power in his own suit to match Morey's velocity.\n\nArcot grabbed Morey's leg and turned his power down until he had a\nweight of fifty pounds. Soon they were both falling again, and when\ntheir rate of fall amounted to approximately twenty miles per hour,\nArcot cut their weight to zero and they continued down through their\nmomentum. Just short of the ground, he leaped free of Morey, who,\ncarried on by momentum, touched the ground a moment later. Wade at once\njumped in and held him down.\n\n\"Now, now! Calm yourself,\" said Wade solicitously. \"Don't go up in the\nair like that over the least little thing.\"\n\n\"I won't, if you'll get busy and take this damned thing off--or fasten\nsome lead to my feet!\" replied Morey, starting to unstrap the mechanism.\n\n\"You'd better hold your horses there,\" said Arcot. \"If you take that off\nnow, we sure will need the _Ancient Mariner_ to catch up with it. It\nwill produce an acceleration that no man could ever stand--something on\nthe order of five thousand gravities, if the tubes could stand it. And\nsince that one is equipped with the invisibility apparatus, you'd be out\none good invisibility suit. Restrain yourself, boy, and I'll go get a\nnew knob control.\n\n\"Wade, get the boy a rock to hold him down. Better tie it around his\nneck so he won't forget it and fly off into space again. It's a nuisance\nlocating so small an object in space and I promised his father I'd bring\nthe body back if there was anything left of it.\" He released Morey as\nWade handed him a large stone.\n\nA few minutes later, he returned with a new adjustment dial and repaired\nMorey's apparatus. The strain was released when he turned it, and Morey\nparted with the rock with relief.\n\nMorey grunted in relief, and looked at the offending pack.\n\n\"You know, that being stuck with a sky-bound gadget that you can't turn\noff is the nastiest combination of feeling stupid, helpless, comical,\nsilly and scared I've hit yet. It now--somewhat late--occurs to me that\nthis is powered with a standard power coil, straight off the production\nline, and that it has a standard overload cut-out for protection of\nassociated equipment. I want to install an emergency cutoff switch, in\ncase a knob, or something else, goes sour. But I want to have the\nemergency overload where I can decide whether or not an emergency\noverload is to be accepted. I'd feel a sight more than silly if that\noverload relay popped while I was a couple thousand feet up.\n\n\"Trouble with all this new stuff of ours is that we simply haven't had\ntime to find out all the 'I never thought of that' things that can go\nwrong. If the grid resistor on that oscillator went out, for instance,\nwhat would it do?\"\n\nArcot cocked an eye at the power pack, visualizing the circuits. \"Full\nblast, straight up, and no control. But modern printed resistors don't\nfail.\"\n\n\"That's what it says in all the books.\" Wade nodded wisely. \"And you\nshould see the stock of replacement units every electronics shop stocks\nfor purposes of replacing infallible units, too. You've got a point, my\nfriend.\"\n\n\"I can see four ways we can change these things to fail-safe operation,\nif we add Morey's emergency cut-off switch. If it did go on-full then,\nyou could use intermittent operation and get down,\" Arcot acknowledged.\n\n\"Anybody know what silly fail-unsafe tricks we overlooked in the\n_Ancient Mariner_?\" Fuller asked.\n\n\"That,\" said Wade with a grimace, \"is a silly question. The 'I didn't\nthink of that' type of failure occurs because I didn't think of that,\nand the reason I didn't think of it is because it never occurred to me.\nIf we'd been able to think of 'em, we would have. We'll probably get\nstuck with a few more yet, before we get back. But at least we can clean\nup a few bugs in these things now.\"\n\n\"Forget it for now, Wade, and get that chow on,\" suggested Fuller. He\nwas lying on his back, clad only in a pair of short trunks, completely\nrelaxed and enjoying life. \"We can do that when it's dark here.\"\n\n\"Fuller has the right idea,\" said Morey, looking at Fuller with a\njudicious eye. \"I think I'll follow his example.\"\n\n\"Which makes three in favor and one on the way,\" said Arcot, as he came\nout of the ship and sank down on the soft sand of the beach.\n\nThey lay around for a while after lunch, and then decided to swim in the\ncool waters of the lake. One of them was to stand guard while the others\nwent in swimming. Standing guard consisted of lying on his back on the\nsoft sand, and staring up at the delightful contrast of lush green\nfoliage and deep blue sky.\n\nIt was several hours before they gathered up their things and returned\nto the ship. They felt more rested than they had before their exercise.\nThey had not been tired before, merely restless, and the physical\nexercise had made them far more comfortable.\n\nThey gathered again in the control room. All the apparatus had been\ntaken in; the tanks were filled, and the compressed oxygen replenished.\nThey closed the airlock and were ready to start again.\n\nAs they lifted into the air, Arcot looked at the lake that was shrinking\nbelow them. \"Nice place for a picnic; we'll have to remember that place.\nIt isn't more than twenty million light years from home.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" agreed Morey, \"it is handy. But suppose we find out where home is\nfirst; let's go find the local inhabitants.\"\n\n\"Excellent idea. Which way do we go to look?\" Wade asked.\n\n\"This lake must have an outlet to the sea,\" Morey answered. \"I suggest\nwe follow it. Most rivers of any size have a port near the mouth, and a\nport usually means a city.\"\n\n\"Let's go,\" said Arcot, swinging the shining ship about and heading\nsmoothly down along the line of the little stream that had its beginning\nat the lake. They moved on across the mountains and over the green\nfoothills until they came to a broad, rolling plain.\n\n\"I wonder if this planet _is_ inhabited,\" Arcot mused. \"None of this\nland seems to be cultivated.\"\n\nMorey had been scanning the horizon with a pair of powerful binoculars.\n\"No, the land isn't cultivated, but take a look over there--see that\nrange of little hills over to the right? Take a look.\" He handed the\nbinoculars to Arcot.\n\nArcot looked long and quietly. At last he lowered the binoculars and\nhanded them to Wade, who sat next to him.\n\n\"It looks like the ruins of a city,\" Arcot said. \"Not the ruins that a\nstorm would make, but the ruins that high explosives would make. I'd say\nthere had been a war and the people who once lived here had been driven\noff.\"\n\n\"So would I,\" rejoined Morey. \"I wonder if we could find the\nconquerors?\"\n\n\"Maybe--unless it was mutual annihilation!\"\n\nThey rose a bit higher and raised their speed to a thousand miles an\nhour. On and on they flew, high above the gently rolling plain, mile\nafter mile. The little brooklet became a great river, and the river kept\ngrowing more and more. Ahead of them was a range of hills, and they\nwondered how the river could thread its way among them. They found that\nit went through a broad pass that twisted tortuously between high\nmountains.\n\nA few miles farther on, they came to a great natural basin in the pass,\na wide, level bowl. And in almost the exact center, they saw a looming\nmass of buildings--a great city!\n\n\"Look!\" cried Morey. \"I told you it was inhabited!\"\n\nArcot winced. \"Yes, but if you shout in my ear like that again, you'll\nhave to write things out for me for ever after.\" He was just as excited\nas Morey, nevertheless.\n\nThe great mass of the city was shaped like a titanic cone that stood\nhalf mile high and was fully a mile and a half in radius. But the\nremarkable thing about it was the perfect uniformity with which the\nbuildings and every structure seemed to conform to this plan. It seemed\nas though an invisible, but very tangible line had been drawn in the\nair.\n\nIt was as though a sign had been posted: \"Here there shall be buildings.\nBeyond this line, no structure shall extend, nor any vehicle go!\"\n\nThe air directly above the city was practically packed with slim, long,\nneedle-like ships of every size--from tiny private ships less than\nfifteen feet long to giant freighters of six hundred feet and longer.\nAnd every one of them conformed to the rule perfectly!\n\nOnly around the base of the city there seemed to be a slight deviation.\nWhere the invisible cone should have touched the ground, there was a\nseries of low buildings made of some dark metal, and all about them the\nground appeared scarred and churned.\n\n\"They certainly seem to have some kind of ray screen over that city,\"\nMorey commented. \"Just look at that perfect cone effect and those low\nbuildings are undoubtedly the projectors.\"\n\nArcot had brought the ship to a halt as he came through the pass in the\nmountain. The shining hull was in the cleft of the gorge, and was, no\ndoubt, quite hard to see from the city.\n\nSuddenly, a vagrant ray of the brilliant sun reached down through a\nbreak in the overcast of clouds and touched the shining hull of the\n_Ancient Mariner_ with a finger of gold. Instantly, the ship shone like\nthe polished mirror of a heliograph.\n\nAlmost immediately, a low sound came from the distant city. It was a\npulsing drone that came through the microphone in a weird cadence; a\nlow, beating drone, like some wild music. Louder and stronger it grew,\nrising in pitch slowly, then it suddenly ended in a burst of rising\nsound--a terrific whoop of alarm.\n\nAs if by magic, every ship in the air above the city shot downward,\ndropping suddenly out of sight. In seconds, the air was cleared.\n\n\"It seems they've spotted us,\" said Arcot in a voice he tried to make\nnonchalant.\n\nA fleet of great, long ships was suddenly rising from the neighborhood\nof the central building, the tallest of the group. They went in a\ncompact wedge formation and shot swiftly down along the wall of the\ninvisible cone until they were directly over the low building nearest\nthe _Ancient Mariner._ There was a sudden shimmer in the air. In an\ninstant, the ships were through and heading toward the _Ancient Mariner_\nat a tremendous rate.\n\nThey shot forward with an acceleration that was astonishing to the men\nin the spaceship. In perfect formation, they darted toward the lone,\nshining ship from far-off Earth!\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\n\nThe four earthmen watched the fleet of alien ships roar through the air\ntoward them.\n\n\"Now how shall we signal them?\" asked Morey, also trying to be\nnonchalant, and failing as badly as Arcot had.\n\n\"Don't try the light beam method,\" cautioned Arcot. The last time they\nhad tried to use a light beam signal was when they first contacted the\nNigrans. The Nigrans thought it was some kind of destruction ray. That\nhad started the terrible destructive war of the Black Star.\n\n\"Let's just hang here peaceably and see what they do,\" Arcot suggested.\n\nMotionless, the _Ancient Mariner_ hung before the advancing attack of\nthe great battle fleet. The shining hull was a thing of beauty in the\ngolden sunlight as it waited for the advancing ships.\n\nThe alien ships slowed as they approached and spread out in a great\nfan-shaped crescent.\n\nSuddenly, the _Ancient Mariner_ gave a tremendous leap and hurtled\ntoward them at a terrific speed, under an acceleration so great that\nArcot was nearly hurled into unconsciousness. He would have been except\nfor the terrific mass of the ship. To produce that acceleration in so\ngreat a mass, a tremendous force was needed, a force that even made the\nenemy fleet reel under its blow!\n\nBut, sudden as it was, Arcot had managed to push the power into reverse,\nusing the force of the molecular drive to counteract the attraction the\naliens had brought to bear.\n\nThe whole mighty fabric of the ship creaked as the titanic load came\nupon it. They were using a force of a million tons!\n\nThe mighty lux beams withstood the stress, however, and the ship came to\na halt, then was swiftly backing away from the alien battle fleet.\n\n\"We can give them all they want!\" said Arcot grimly. He noticed that\nWade and Fuller had been knocked out by the sudden blow, but Morey,\nthough slightly groggy, was still in possession of his senses.\n\n\"Let's not,\" Morey remonstrated. \"We may be able to make friends with\nthem, but not if we kill them off.\"\n\n\"Right!\" replied Arcot, \"but we're going to give them a little\ndemonstration of power!\"\n\nThe _Ancient Mariner_ leaped suddenly upward with a speed that defied\nthe eyes of the men at the rays of the enemy ships. Then, as they turned\nto follow the sudden motion of the ship--_it was not there!_\n\nThe _Ancient Mariner_ had vanished!\n\nMorey was startled for an instant as the ship and his companions\ndisappeared around him, then he realized what had happened. Arcot had\nused the invisibility apparatus!\n\nArcot turned and raced swiftly far off to one side, behind the strange\nships, and hovered over the great cliff that made the edge of the cleft\nthat was the river bed. Then he snapped the ship into full visibility.\n\nWade and Fuller had recovered by now, and Arcot started barking out\norders. \"Wade--Fuller--take the molecular ray, Wade, and tear down that\ncliff--throw it down into the valley. Fuller, turn the heat beams on\nwith all the power you can get and burn that refuse he tears down into a\nheap of molten lava!\n\n\"I'm going to show them what we can do! And, Wade--after Fuller gets it\nmelted down, throw the molten lava high in the air!\"\n\nFrom the ship, a long pencil of rays, faintly violet from the air they\nionized, reached out and touched the cliff. In an instant, it had torn\ndown a vast mass of the solid rock, which came raining down into the\nvalley with a roaring thunder and threw the dirt of the valley into the\nair like splashed mud.\n\nThen the violet ray died, and two rays of blinding brilliance reached\nout. The rock was suddenly smoking, steaming. Then it became red, dull\nat first, then brighter and brighter. Suddenly it collapsed into a great\npool of white-hot lava, flowing like water under the influence of the\nbeams from the ship.\n\nAgain the pale violet of the molecular beams touched the rock--which was\nnow bubbling lava. In an instant, the great mass of flaming incandescent\nrock was flying like a glowing meteor, up into the air. It shot up with\nterrific speed, broke up in mid-air, and fell back as a rain of red-hot\nstone.\n\nThe bright rays died out, but the pale fingers of the molecular beams\ntraced across the level ground. As they touched it, the solid soil\nspouted into the air like some vast fountain, to fall back as\nfrost-covered powder.\n\nThe rays that had swung a sun into destruction were at work! What chance\nhad man, or the works of man against such? What mattered a tiny planet\nwhen those rays could hurl one mighty sun into another, to blaze up in\nan awful conflagration that would light up space for a million light\nyears around with a mighty glare of light!\n\nAs if by a giant plow, the valley was torn and rent in great streaks by\nthe pale violet rays of the molecular force. Wade tore loose a giant\nboulder and sent it rocketing into the heavens. It came down with a\nterrific crash minutes later, to bury itself deep in the soil as it\nsplintered into fragments.\n\nSuddenly the _Ancient Mariner_ was jerked violently again. Evidently\nundaunted by their display of power, the aliens' rays had gripped the\nEarthmen's ship again and were drawing it with terrific acceleration.\nBut this time the ship was racing toward the city, caught by the beam of\none of the low-built, sturdy buildings that housed the protective ray\nprojectors.\n\nAgain Arcot threw on the mighty power units that drove the ship, bracing\nthem against the pull of the beam.\n\n\"Wade! Use the molecular ray! Stop that beam!\" Arcot ordered.\n\nThe ship was stationary, quivering under the titanic forces that\nstruggled for it. The enemy fleet raced toward them, trying to come to\nthe aid of the men in the tower.\n\nThe pale glow of the molecular beam reached out its ghostly finger and\ntouched the heavy-walled ray projector building. There was a sudden\nflash of discharging energy, and the tower was hurled high in the air,\nleaving only a gaping hole in the ground.\n\nInstantly, with the collapse of the beam that held it, the _Ancient\nMariner_ shot backward, away from the scene of the battle. Arcot snapped\noff the drive and turned on the invisibility apparatus. They hung\nmotionless, silent and invisible in the air, awaiting developments.\n\nIn close formation, one group of ships blocked the opening in the wall\nof rays that the removal of one projector building had caused. Three\nother ships went to investigate the wreck of the building that had\nfallen a mile away.\n\nThe rest of the fleet circled the city, darting around, searching\nfrantically for the invisible enemy, fully aware of the danger of\ncollision. The unnerving tension of expecting it every second made them\nerratic and nervous to the _n_th degree.\n\n\"They're sticking pretty close to home,\" said Arcot. \"They don't seem to\nbe too anxious to play with us.\"\n\n\"They don't, do they?\" Morey said, looking angry. \"They might at least\nhave been willing to see what we wanted. I want to investigate some\nother cities. Come on!\" He had thoroughly enjoyed the rest at the little\nmountain lake, and he was disappointed that they had been driven away.\nHad they wanted to, he knew, they could easily have torn the entire city\nout by the roots!\n\n\"I think we ought to smash them thoroughly,\" said Wade. \"They're\ncertainly inhospitable people!\"\n\n\"And I, for one, would like to know what that attraction ray was,\" said\nFuller curiously.\n\n\"The ray is easily understood after you take a look at the wreck it\nmade of some of these instruments,\" Arcot told him. \"It was projected\nmagnetism. I can see how it might be done if you worked on it for a\nwhile. The ray simply attracted everything in its path that was\nmagnetic, which included our lux metal hull.\n\n\"Luckily, most of our apparatus is shielded against magnetism. The few\nthings that aren't can be repaired easily. But I'll bet Wade finds his\ngear in the galley thrown around quite a bit.\"\n\n\"Where do we go from here, then?\" Wade asked.\n\n\"Well, this world is bigger than Earth,\" said Morey. \"Even if they're\nafraid to go out of their cities to run farms, they must have other\ncities. The thing that puzzles me, though, is how they do it--I don't\nsee how they can possibly raise enough food for a city in the area they\nhave available!\"\n\n\"'People couldn't possibly live in hydrogen instead of oxygen',\" Arcot\nquoted, grinning. \"That's what they told me when I made my little\nannouncement at the meeting on the Black Star situation. The only\ntrouble was--they did. That suggestion of yours meets the same fate,\nMorey!\"\n\n\"All right, you win,\" agreed Morey. \"Now let's see if we can find the\nother nations on this world more friendly.\"\n\nArcot looked at the sun. \"We're now well north of the equator. We'll go\nup where the air is thin, put on some speed, and go into the south\ntemperate zone. We'll see if we can't find some people there who are\nmore peaceably inclined.\"\n\nArcot cut off the invisibility tubes. Instantly, all the enemy ships in\nthe neighborhood turned and darted toward them at top speed. But the\nshining _Ancient Mariner_ darted into the deep blue vault of the sky,\nand a moment later was lost to their view.\n\n\"They had a lot of courage,\" said Arcot, looking down at the city as it\nsank out of sight. \"It doesn't take one-quarter as much courage to fight\na known enemy, no matter how deadly, as it does to fight an unknown\nenemy force--something that can tear down mountains and throw their\nforts into the air like toys.\"\n\n\"Oh, they had courage, all right,\" Morey conceded, \"but I wish they\nhadn't been quite so anxious to display it!\"\n\nThey were high above the ground now, accelerating with a force of one\ngravity. Arcot cut the acceleration down until there was just enough to\novercome the air resistance, which, at the height they were flying, was\nvery low. The sky was black above them, and the stars were showing\naround the blazing sun. They were unfamiliar stars in unfamiliar\nconstellations--the stars of another universe.\n\nIn a very short time, the ship was dropping rapidly downward again, the\nhorizontal power off. The air resistance slowed them rapidly. They\ndrifted high over the south temperate zone. Below them stretched the\nseemingly endless expanse of a great blue-green ocean.\n\n\"They don't lack for water, do they?\" Wade commented.\n\n\"We could pretty well figure on large oceans,\" Arcot said. \"The land is\ngreen, and there are plenty of clouds.\"\n\nFar ahead, a low mass of solid land appeared above the blue of the\nhorizon. It soon became obvious that it was not a continent they were\napproaching, but a large island, stretching hundreds of miles north and\nsouth.\n\nArcot dropped the ship lower; the mountainous terrain had become so\nbroken that it would be impossible to detect a city from thirty miles\nup.\n\nThe green defiles of the great mountains not only provided good\ncamouflage, but kept any great number of ships from attacking the sides,\nwhere the ray stations were. The cities were certainly located with an\neye for war! Arcot wondered what sort of conflict had lasted so long\nthat cities were designed for perpetual war. Had they never had peace?\n\n\"Look!\" Fuller called. \"There's another city!\" Below them, situated in a\nlittle natural bowl in the mountains, was another of the cone cities.\n\nWade and Fuller manned the ray projectors again; Arcot dropped the ship\ntoward the city, one hand on the _reverse_ switch in case the\ninhabitants tried to use the magnetic beam again.\n\nAt last, they had come quite low. There were no ships in the air, and\nno people in sight.\n\nSuddenly, the outside microphone picked up a low, humming sound. A long,\ncigar-shaped object was heading toward the ship at high speed. It had\nbeen painted a dark, mottled green, and was nearly invisible against\nbackground of foliage beneath the ship.\n\n\"Wade! Catch that on the ray!\" Arcot commanded sharply, moving the ship\nto one side at the same time. Instantly, the guided missile turned and\nkept coming toward them.\n\nWade triggered the molecular beam, and the missile was suddenly dashing\ntoward the ground with terrific speed. There was a terrific flash of\nflame and a shock wave of concussion. A great hole gaped in the ground.\n\n\"They sure know their chemistry,\" remarked Wade, looking down at the\ngreat hole the explosion had torn in the ground. \"That wasn't atomic,\nbut on the other hand, it wasn't dynamite or TNT, either! I'd like to\nknow what they use!\"\n\n\"Personally,\" said Arcot angrily, \"I think that was more or less a\ngentle hint to move on!\" He didn't like the way they were being\nreceived; he had wanted to meet these people. Of course, the other\nplanet might be inhabited, but if it wasn't--\n\n\"I wonder--\" said Morey thoughtfully. \"Arcot, those people were\nobviously warned against our attack--probably by that other city. Now,\nwe've come nearly halfway around this world; certainly we couldn't have\ngone much farther away and still be on the planet. And we find this city\nin league with the other! Since this league goes halfway around the\nworld, and they expected us to do the same, isn't it fair to assume,\njust on the basis of geographical location, that all this world is in\none league?\"\n\n\"Hmmm--an interplanetary war,\" mused Arcot. \"That would certainly prove\nthat one of the other planets is inhabited. The question is--which one?\"\n\n\"The most probable one is the next inner planet, Aphrodite,\" replied\nMorey.\n\nArcot fired the ship into the sky. \"If your conclusions are\ncorrect--and I think they are--I see no reason to stay on this planet.\nLet's go see if their neighbors are less aggressive!\"\n\nWith that, he shot the ship straight up, rotating the axis until it was\npointing straight away from the planet. He increased the acceleration\nuntil, as they left the outer fringes of the atmosphere, the ship was\nhitting a full four gravities.\n\n\"I'm going to shorten things up and use the space control,\" Arcot said.\n\"The gravitational field of the sun will drain a lot of our energy out,\nbut so what? Lead is cheap, and before we're through, we'll have plenty\nor I'll know the reason why!\"\n\nDr. Richard Arcot was angry--boiling all the way through!\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\n\nThere was the familiar tension in the air as the space field built up\nand they were hurled suddenly forward; the star-like dot of the planet\nsuddenly expanded as they rushed forward at a speed far greater than\nthat of light. In a moment, it had grown to a disc; Arcot stopped the\nspace control. Again they were moving forward on molecular drive.\n\nVery shortly, Arcot began to decelerate. Within ten minutes, they were\nbeginning to feel the outermost wisps of the cloud-laden atmosphere. The\nheat of the blazing sun was intense; the surface of the planet was, no\ndoubt, a far warmer place than Earthmen would find comfortable. They\nwould have been far better suited to remain on the other planet, but\nthey very evidently were not wanted!\n\nThey dropped down through the atmosphere, sinking for miles as the ship\nslowed to the retarding influence of the air and the molecular power.\nDown they went, through mile after mile of heavy cloud layer, unable to\nsee the ground beneath them.\n\nThen, suddenly, the thick, all-enveloping mists that held them were\ngone. They were flying smoothly along under leaden skies--perpetual,\ndim, dark clouds. Despite the brightness of the sun above them, the\nclouds made the light dim and gray. They reflected such an enormous\npercentage of the light that struck them that the climate was not as hot\nas they had feared.\n\nThe ground was dark under its somber mantle of clouds; the hills, the\nrivers that crawled across wide plains, and the oddly stunted forests\nall looked as though they had been modeled in a great mass of\ngreenish-gray putty. It was a discouraging world.\n\n\"I'm glad we didn't wait for our swim here,\" remarked Wade. \"It sure\nlooks like rain.\"\n\nArcot stopped the ship and held it motionless at ten miles while Wade\nmade his chemical analysis of the air. The report looked favorable;\nplenty of oxygen and a trace of carbon dioxide mixed with nitrogen.\n\n\"But the water vapor!\" Wade said. \"The air is saturated with it! It\nwon't be the heat, but the humidity that'll bother us--to coin a\nphrase.\"\n\nArcot dropped the ship still farther, at the same time moving forward\ntoward a sea he had seen in the distance. Swiftly, the ground sped\nbeneath them. The low plain sloped toward the sea, a vast, level surface\nof gray, leaden water.\n\n\"Oh, brother, what a pleasant world,\" said Fuller sarcastically.\n\nIt was certainly not an inspiring scene. The leaden skies, the heavy\nclouds, the dark land, and the gray-green of the sea, always shaded in\nperpetual half-light, lest the burning sun heat them beyond endurance.\nIt was a gloomy world.\n\nThey turned and followed the coast. Still no sign of inhabitants was\nvisible. Mile after mile passed beneath them as the shining ship\nfollowed up the ragged shore. Small indentations and baylets ran into a\nshallow, level sea. This world had no moon, so it was tideless, except\nfor the slight solar tides.\n\nFinally, far ahead of them, and well back from the coast, Arcot spotted\na great mountain range.\n\n\"I'm going to head for that,\" he told the others. \"If these people are\nat war with our very inimical friends of the other planet, chances are\nthey'll put their cities in the mountains, too.\"\n\nThey had such cities. The _Ancient Mariner_ had penetrated less than a\nhundred miles along the twisted ranges of the mountains before they saw,\nfar ahead, a great, cone-shaped city. The city was taller, larger than\nthose of the other planet, and the cone ran up farther from the actual\ncity buildings, leaving the aircraft more room.\n\nArcot stopped and watched the city a long time through the telescope. It\nseemed similar to the others in all respects. The same type of\nneedle-like ships floated in the air above it, and the same type of cone\nray projectors nestled in the base of the city's invisible protection.\n\n\"We may as well take a chance,\" said Arcot. He shot the ship forward\nuntil they were within a mile of the city, in plain sight of the\ninhabitants.\n\nSuddenly, without any warning signal, apparently, all the air traffic\nwent wild--then it was gone. Every ship seemed to have ducked into some\nunseen place of refuge.\n\nWithin a few minutes, a fleet of battleships was winging its way toward\nthe invisible barrier. Then it was out, and, in a great semi-cylinder a\nquarter of a mile high, and a quarter of a mile in radius, they advanced\ntoward the _Ancient Mariner_.\n\nArcot kept the ship motionless. He knew that their only weapon was the\nmagnetic ray; otherwise they would have won the war long ago. And he\nknew he could cope with magnetism.\n\nSlowly the ships advanced. At last, they halted a quarter of a mile from\nthe Earth ship. A single ship detached itself from the mass and\nadvanced to within a few hundred feet of the _Ancient Mariner_.\n\nQuickly, Arcot jumped to his feet. \"Morey, take the controls. Evidently\nthey want to parley, not fight. I'm going over there.\"\n\nHe ran the length of the corridor to his room and put on his power suit.\nA moment later, he left the airlock and launched himself into space,\nflying swiftly toward the ship. He had come alone, but armed as he was,\nhe was probably more than a match for anything they could bring to bear\non him.\n\nHe went directly toward the broad expanse of glass that marked the\ncontrol room of the alien ship and looked in curiously.\n\nThe pilot was a man much like Arcot; quite tall, and of tremendous\ngirth, with a huge chest and great powerful arms. His hands, like those\nof the Venerians, had two thumbs.\n\nWith equal curiosity, the man stared at Arcot, floating in the air\nwithout apparent means of support.\n\nArcot hung there a moment, then motioned that he wished to enter. The\ngiant alien motioned him around to the side of the ship. Halfway down\nthe length of the ship, Arcot saw a port suddenly open. He flew swiftly\nforward and entered.\n\nThe man who stood there was a giant as tall as Wade and even more\nmagnificently muscled, with tremendous shoulders and giant chest. His\nthighs, rounded under a close-fitting gray uniform, were bulging with\nsmooth muscle.\n\nHe was considerably larger than the man in the pilot room, and whereas\nthe other had been a pale yellow in color, this man was burned to a more\nhealthy shade of tan. His features were regular and pleasing; his hair\nwas black and straight; his high forehead denoted a high degree of\nintelligence, and his clear black eyes, under heavy black eyebrows,\nseemed curious, but friendly.\n\nHis nose was rather thin, but not sharp, and his mouth was curved in a\nsmile of welcome. His chin was firm and sharp, distinct from his face\nand neck.\n\nThey looked each other over, and Arcot smiled as their eyes met.\n\n\"Torlos,\" said the alien, pointing to his great chest.\n\n\"Arcot,\" replied the Earthman, pointing to himself. Then he pointed to\nthe stranger. \"Torlos.\" He knew he hadn't pronounced it exactly as the\nalien had, but it would suffice.\n\nThe stranger smiled in approval. \"Ahcut,\" he said, pointing to the\nEarthman.\n\nThen he pointed to the comparatively thin arms of the Earthman, and to\nhis own. Then he pointed to Arcot's head and to the mechanism he wore on\nhis back, then to his own head, and went through the motions of walking\nwith great effort.\n\nAgain he pointed at Arcot's head, nodding his own in approval.\n\nArcot understood immediately what was meant. The alien had indicated\nthat the Earthman was comparatively weak, but that he had no need of\nmuscle, for he made his head and his machines work for him. And he had\ndecided that the head was better!\n\nArcot looked at the man's eyes and concentrated on the idea of\nfriendship, projecting it with all his mental power. The black eyes\nsuddenly widened in surprise, which quickly turned to pleasure as he\ntried to concentrate on one thought.\n\nIt was difficult for Arcot to interpret the thoughts of the alien; all\nhis concepts were in a different form. At last, he caught the idea of\nlocation--but it was location in the interrogative! How was he to\ninterpret that?\n\nThen it hit him. Torlos was asking: \"Where are you from?\"\n\nArcot pulled a pad of paper and a pencil from his pocket and began to\nsketch rapidly. First, he drew the local galaxy, with dots for stars,\nand swept his hand around him. He made one of the dots a little heavier\nand pointed at the bright blur in the cloudy sky above them. Then he\ndrew a circle around that dot and put another dot on it, at the same\ntime indicating the planet beneath them.\n\nTorlos showed that he understood.\n\nArcot continued. At the other end of the paper, he drew another galaxy,\nand indicated Earth. Then he drew a dotted line from Earth to the planet\nthey were now on.\n\nTorlos looked at him in incredulous wonder. Again he indicated his\nrespect for Arcot's brain.\n\nArcot smiled and indicated the city. \"Can we go there?\" he projected\ninto the other's mind.\n\nTorlos turned and glanced toward the end of the corridor. There was no\none in sight, so he shouted an order in a deep, pleasant voice.\nInstantly, another giant man came striding down the corridor with a\nlithe softness that indicated tremendous muscular power, excellently\ncontrolled. He saluted by placing his left hand over the right side of\nhis chest. Arcot noted that for future reference.\n\nTorlos spoke to the other alien for a moment. The other left and\nreturned a minute later and said something to Torlos. Torlos turned to\nArcot indicating that he should return to his ship and follow them.\n\nArcot suddenly turned his eyes and looked directly into the black eyes\nof the alien. \"Torlos,\" he projected, \"will you come with us on our\nship?\"\n\n\"I am commander of this ship. I can not go without the permission of my\nchief. I will ask my chief.\"\n\nAgain he turned and left Arcot. He was back in a few minutes carrying a\nsmall handbag. \"I can go. This keeps me in communication with my ship.\"\n\nArcot adjusted his weight to zero and floated lightly out the doorway.\nHe rose about six feet above the landing, then indicated to Torlos that\nhe was to grasp Arcot's feet, one in each hand. Torlos closed a grip of\nsteel about each ankle and stepped off the platform.\n\nAt once, they dropped, for the power suit had not been adjusted to the\nload. Arcot yelped in pain as Torlos, in his surprise at not floating,\ninvoluntarily gripped tighter. Quickly, Arcot turned on more power and\ngasped as he felt the weight mount swiftly. He had estimated Torlos'\nweight at two hundred seventy or so--and it was more like three hundred\nand fifty! Soon, however, he had the weight adjusted, and they floated\neasily up toward the _Ancient Mariner_.\n\nThey floated in through the door of the ship, and, once inside, Torlos\nreleased his hold. Arcot was immediately slammed to the roof with a\nweight of three hundred and fifty pounds!\n\nA moment later, he was again back on the floor, rubbing his back. He\nshook his head and frowned, then smiled and pretended to limp.\n\n\"Don't let go so suddenly,\" he admonished telepathically.\n\n\"I did not know. I am sorry,\" Torlos thought contritely.\n\n\"Who's your friend?\" asked Wade as he entered the corridor. \"He\ncertainly looks husky.\"\n\n\"He is,\" Arcot affirmed. \"And he must be weighted with lead! I thought\nhe'd pull my legs off. Look at those arms!\"\n\n\"I don't want to get him mad at me,\" Wade grinned. \"He looks like he'd\nmake a mean opponent. What's his name?\"\n\n\"Torlos,\" replied Arcot, just as Fuller stepped in.\n\nTorlos was looking curiously at a crowbar that had been lying in a rack\non the wall. He picked it up and flexed it a bit, as a man might flex a\nrapier to test its material. Then he held it far out in front of him and\nproceeded to tie a knot in the inch-thick metal bar! Then, still\nfrowning in puzzlement, he untied it, straightened it as best he could,\nand put it back in the rack.\n\nThe Earthmen were staring in utter astonishment to see the terrific\nstrength the man displayed.\n\nHe smiled as he turned to them again.\n\n\"If he could do that at arm's length,\" Wade said thoughtfully, \"what\ncould he do if he really tried?\"\n\n\"Why don't you try and see?\" Fuller asked sweetly.\n\n\"I can think of easier--but probably no quicker--ways of committing\nsuicide,\" Wade replied.\n\nArcot laughed and, looking at Torlos, projected the general meaning of\nthe last remarks. Torlos joined them in the laugh.\n\n\"All my people are strong,\" he thought. \"I can not understand why you\nare not. That was a tool? We could not use it so; it is too weak.\"\n\nWade and the others picked up the thought, and Wade laughed. \"I suppose\nthey use old I-beams to tie up their Christmas presents.\"\n\nArcot held a moment of silent consultation with Torlos, then turned to\nthe others. \"We are supposed to follow these men to their city to have\nsome kind of an audience with their ruler, according to Torlos. Let's\nget started; the rest of the fleet is waiting.\"\n\nArcot led Torlos through the main engine room, and was going into the\nmain coil room when Torlos stopped him.\n\n\"Is this all your drive apparatus?\" he thought.\n\n\"Yes, it is,\" Arcot projected.\n\n\"It is smaller than the power equipment of a small private machine!\" His\nthoughts radiated surprise. \"How could you make so great a distance?\"\n\n\"Power,\" said Arcot. \"Look!\" He drew his molecular ray pistol. \"This\nalone is powerful enough to destroy all your battle fleet without any\ndanger on our part. And, despite your strength, you are helpless against\nme!\"\n\nArcot touched a switch on his belt and vanished.\n\nIn amazement, Torlos reached out a hand to the spot where Arcot had\nstood. There was nothing there. Suddenly, he turned, touching the back\nof his head. Something had tugged at his hair!\n\nHe looked all around him and moved his arms around--to no avail. There\nwas nothing there.\n\nThen, in the blink of an eye, Arcot was floating in the air before him.\n\"What avails strength against air, Torlos?\" he asked, smiling.\n\n\"For safety's sake,\" Torlos thought, \"I want to be your friend!\" He\ngrinned widely.\n\nArcot led the way on into the control room, where Morey had already\nstarted to follow the great fleet toward the city.\n\n\"What are we going to do at the city?\" Arcot asked Torlos\ntelepathically.\n\n\"This is the capital of the world, Sator, and here is the\ncommander-of-all-military-and-civil-forces. It is he you will see. He\nhas been summoned,\" Torlos replied carefully.\n\n\"We visited the third world of this system first,\" Arcot told the\nalien, \"and they repulsed us. We tried to be friendly, but they attacked\nus at once. In order to keep from being damaged, we had to destroy one\nof their city-protecting ray buildings.\" This last thought was hard to\ntransmit; Arcot had pictured mentally a scene in which the ray building\nwas ripped out of the ground and hurled into the air.\n\nIn sudden anxiety and concern, Torlos stared into Arcot's eyes. And in\nthat look, Arcot read what even telepathy had hidden heretofore.\n\n\"Did you destroy the city?\" asked Torlos anxiously. But it was not the\nquestion of a man hoping for the destruction of his enemies' cities;\nArcot got the mental picture of the city, but with it, he picked up the\nidea of \"home\"! Of course, the ideas of \"city\" and \"home\" might be\nsynonymous with these people; they never seemed to leave their cities.\nBut why this feeling of worry?\n\n\"No, we didn't want to hurt them,\" Arcot thought. \"We destroyed the ray\nbuilding only in self defense.\"\n\n\"I understand.\" Despite obvious mental efforts, Torlos positively\nradiated a feeling of relief!\n\n\"Are you at war with that world?\" Arcot asked coolly.\n\n\"The two worlds have been at war for many generations,\" Torlos said,\nthen quickly changed the subject. \"You will soon meet the leader of all\nthe forces of Sator. He is all-powerful here. His word must be\nabsolutely obeyed. It would be wise if you did not unnecessarily offend\nhim. I see from what your mind tells me that you have great power, but\nthere are many ships on Sator, more than Nansal can boast.\n\n\"Our commander, Horlan, is a military commander, but since every man is\nnecessarily a soldier, he is a true ruler.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" Arcot thought. He turned to Morey and spoke in English,\nwhich Torlos could not understand. \"Morey, we're going to see the top\nman here. He rules the army, which runs everything. You and I will go,\nand leave Wade and Fuller behind as a rear guard. It may not be\ndangerous, but after being chased off one world, we ought to be as\ncareful as possible.\n\n\"We'll go fully armed, and we'll stay in radio contact at all times.\nWatch yourselves; we don't want them even to touch this ship until we\nknow what kind of people they are.\"\n\nThey had followed the Satorian ships toward the city. The giant magnetic\nray barrier opened for them, and the _Ancient Mariner_ followed. They\nwere inside the alien city.\n\n\n\n\nXVI\n\n\nBelow the _Ancient Mariner_, the great buildings of the alien city\njutted up in the gray light of this gray world; their massiveness seemed\nonly to accentuate the depressing light.\n\nOn the broad roofs, they saw hundreds of people coming out to watch them\nas they moved across the city. According to Torlos, they were the first\nfriendly strangers they had ever seen. They had explored all the planets\nof this system without finding friendly life.\n\nThe buildings sloped up toward the center of the city, and the mass of\nthe great central building loomed before them.\n\nThe fleet that was leading the Earth ship settled down to a wide\ncourtyard that surrounded the building. Arcot dropped the _Ancient\nMariner_ down beside them. The men from Torlos' ship formed into two\nsquads as they came out of the airlocks and marched over to the great\nshining ship of Earth. They formed two neat rows, one on each side of\nthe airlock.\n\n\"Come on, Morey,\" said Arcot. \"We're wanted. Wade, keep the radio going\nat full amplification; the building may cut out some of the power. I'll\ntry to keep you posted on what's going on, but we'll probably be busy\nanswering questions telepathically.\"\n\nArcot and Morey followed Torlos out into the dim light of the gray sky,\nwalking across the courtyard between the ranks of the soldiers from\nTorlos' ship.\n\nBefore them was a heavy gate of solid bronze which swung on massive\nbronze hinges. The building seemed to be made of a dense, gray stone,\nmuch like granite, which was depressing in its perfectly unrelieved\nfront. There were no bright spots of color as there were on all Earthly\nand Venerian structures. Even the lines were grimly utilitarian; there\nseemed to be no decoration.\n\nThrough the great bronze door they walked, and across a small vestibule.\nThen they were in a mighty concourse, a giant hallway that went\ncompletely through the structure. All around them great granite pillars\nrose to support the mighty building above. Square cut, they lent but\nlittle grace to the huge room, but the floor and walls were made of a\nhard, light green stone, almost the same color as foliage.\n\nOn one wall there was a giant tablet, a great plaque fifteen feet high,\nmade of a deep violet stone, and inlaid with a series of characters in\nthe language of this world. Like English letters, they seemed to read\nhorizontally, but whether they read from left to right or right to left\nthere was no way of knowing. The letters themselves were made of some\nred metal which Arcot and Morey didn't recognize.\n\nArcot turned to Torlos and projected a thought: \"What is that tablet?\"\n\n\"Ever since the beginning of the war with the other planet, Nansal, the\nnames of our mighty leaders have been inscribed on that plaque in the\nrarest metal.\"\n\nThe term \"rarest metal\" was definite to Torlos, and Arcot decided to\nquestion him further on the meaning of it when time permitted.\n\nThey crossed the great hall and came to what was evidently an elevator.\nThe door slid open, and the two Earthmen followed Torlos and his\nlieutenant into the cubicle. Torlos pushed a small button. The door slid\nshut, and a moment later, Arcot and Morey staggered under the sudden\nterrific load as the car shot upward under an acceleration of at least\nthree gravities!\n\nIt continued just long enough for the Earthmen to get used to it, then\nit snapped off, and they went flying up toward the ceiling as it\ncontinued upward under its own momentum. It slowed under the influence\nof the planet's gravitation and came to a stop exactly opposite the\ndoorway of a higher floor.\n\n\"Wow! Some elevator!\" exclaimed Morey as he stepped out, flexing his\nknees as he tried to readjust himself. \"That's what I call a violent way\nof getting upstairs! It wasn't designed by a lazy man or a cripple! I\nprefer to walk, thanks! What I want to know is how the old people get\nupstairs. Or do they die young from using their elevators?\"\n\n\"No,\" mused Arcot. \"That's the funny thing. They don't seem to be\nbothered by the acceleration. They actually jumped a little off the\nfloor when we started, and didn't seem to experience much difficulty\nwhen we stopped.\" He looked thoughtful for a moment. \"You know, when\nTorlos was bending that crowbar back there in the ship, I picked up a\ncurious thought--I wonder if--\" He turned to the giant alien. \"Torlos,\nyou once gave me the thought-idea 'bone metal'; what is that?\"\n\nTorlos looked at him in surprise and then pointed mutely to a heavy belt\nhe wore--made of closely woven links of iron wire!\n\n\"I was right, Morey!\" Arcot exclaimed. \"These men have _iron bones_! No\nwonder he could bend that crowbar! It would be as easy as it would for\nyou or me to snap a human arm bone!\"\n\n\"But, wait a minute!\" Morey objected. \"How could iron grow?\"\n\n\"How can stone grow?\" countered Arcot. \"That's what your bones are,\nessentially--calcium phosphate rock! It's just a matter of different\nbody chemistry. Their body fluids are probably alkaline, and iron won't\nrust in an alkaline solution.\" Arcot was talking rapidly as they\nfollowed the aliens down the long corridor.\n\n\"The thing that confirms my theory is that elevator. It's merely an\niron cage in a magnetic beam, and it's pulled up with a terrific\nacceleration. With iron bones, these men would be similarly influenced,\nand they wouldn't notice the acceleration so much.\"\n\nMorey grinned. \"I'll be willing to bet they don't use cells in their\nprisons, here! Just magnetize the floor, and the poor guy could never\nget away!\"\n\nArcot nodded. \"Of course, the bones must be pure iron; their bones\nevidently don't retain any of the magnetism when they leave the field.\"\n\n\"We seem to be here,\" Morey interrupted. \"Let's continue the discussion\nlater.\"\n\nTheir party had stopped just outside a large, elaborately carved door,\nthe first sign of ornamentation the Earthmen had seen. There were four\nguards armed with pistols, which, they discovered later, were powered by\ncompressed air under terrific pressure. They hurled a small metal slug\nthrough a rifled barrel, and were effective over a distance of about a\nmile, although they could only fire four times without reloading.\n\nTorlos spoke briefly with the guard, who saluted and opened the door.\nThe two Earthmen followed Torlos into a large room.\n\nBefore them was a large, crescent-shaped table, around which were seated\nseveral men. At the center of the crescent curve sat a man in a gray\nuniform, but he was so bedecked with insignia, medals, ribbons, and\ndecorations that his uniform was scarcely visible.\n\nThe entire assemblage, including the leader, rose as the Earthmen\nentered. Arcot and Morey, taking the hint, snapped to attention and\ndelivered a precise military salute.\n\n\"We greet you in the name of our planet,\" said Arcot aloud. \"I know you\ndon't understand a word I'm saying, but I hope it sounds impressive\nenough. We salute you, O High Muckymuck!\"\n\nMorey, successfully keeping a straight face, raised his hand and said\nsonorously: \"That goes double for me, bub.\"\n\nIn his own language, the leader replied, putting his hands to his hips\nwith a definite motion, and shaking his head from side to side at the\nsame time.\n\nArcot watched the man closely while he spoke. He was taller than Torlos,\nbut less heavily built, as were all the others here. It seemed that\nTorlos was unusually powerful, even for this world.\n\nWhen the leader had finished, Arcot smiled and turned to project this\nthoughts at Torlos.\n\n\"Tell your leader that we come from a planet far away across the vast\ndepths of space. We come in peace, and we will leave in peace, but we\nwould like to ask some favors of him, which we will repay by giving him\nthe secret of our weapons. With them, he can easily conquer Nansal.\n\n\"All we want is some wire made from the element lead and some\ninformation from your astronomers.\"\n\nTorlos turned and spoke to his leader in a deep, powerful voice.\n\nMeanwhile, Morey was trying to get in communication with the ship. The\nwalls, however, seemed to be made of metal, and he couldn't get through\nto Wade.\n\n\"We're cut off from the ship,\" he said quietly to Arcot.\n\n\"I was afraid of that, but I think it'll be all right. Our proposition\nis too good for them to turn down.\"\n\nTorlos turned back to Arcot when the leader had finished speaking. \"The\nCommanding One asks that you prove the possibilities of your weapons.\nHis scientists tell him that it is impossible to make the trip that you\nclaim to have made.\"\n\n\"What your scientists say is true, to an extent,\" Arcot thought. \"They\nhave learned that no body can go faster than the speed of light--is that\nnot so?\"\n\n\"Yes. Such, they say, is the fact. To have made this trip, you must, of\nnecessity, be not less than twenty million years old!\"\n\n\"Tell them that there are some things they do not yet know about space.\nThe velocity of light is a thing that is fixed by the nature of space,\nright?\"\n\nTorlos consulted with the scientists again, then turned back to Arcot.\n\"They agree that they do not know all the secrets of the Universe, but\nthey agree that the speed of light is fixed by the nature of space.\"\n\n\"How fast does sound travel?\" Arcot asked.\n\n\"They ask in what medium do you mean?\"\n\n\"How fast does light travel? In air? In glass? The speed of light is as\nvariable as that of sound. If I can alter the nature of space, so as to\nmake the velocity of light greater, can I not then go faster than in\nnormal space?\"\n\n\"They say that this is true,\" Torlos said, after more conversation with\nthe men at the table, \"but they say that space is unalterable, since it\nis emptiness.\"\n\n\"Ask them if they know of the curvature of space.\" Arcot was becoming\nworried for fear his explanation would be unintelligible; unless they\nknew his terms, he could not explain, and it would take a long time to\nteach them.\n\n\"They say,\" Torlos thought, \"that I have misunderstood you. They say\nspace could not possibly be curved, for space is emptiness, and how\ncould empty nothingness be curved.\"\n\nArcot turned to Morey and shrugged his shoulders. \"I give up, Morey;\nit's a bad case. If they insist that space is nothing, and can't be\ncurved, I can't go any further.\"\n\n\"If they don't know of the curvature of space,\" said Morey, \"ask them\nhow they learned that the velocity of light is the limiting velocity of\na moving body.\"\n\nTorlos translated and the scientists gave their reply. \"They say that\nyou do not know more of space than they, for they know that the speed of\nlight is ultimate. They have tested this with spaceships at high speeds\nand with experiments with the smallest particles of electricity.\"\n\nThe scientists were looking at Arcot now in protest; they felt he was\ntrying to foist something off on them.\n\nArcot, too, was becoming exasperated. \"Well, if they insist that we\ncouldn't have come from another star, where do they think I come from?\nThey have explored this system and found no such people as we, so I must\nhave come from another star. How? If they won't accept my explanations,\nlet them think up a theory of their own to explain the facts!\" He\npaused for Torlos to translate, then went on. \"They say I don't know any\nmore than they do. Tell them to watch this.\"\n\nHe drew his molecular ray pistol and lifted a heavy metal chair into the\nair. Then Morey drew his heat beam and turned it on the chair. In a few\nseconds, it was glowing white hot, and then it collapsed into a fiery\nball of liquid metal. Morey shut off the heat beam, and Arcot held the\nball in the air while it cooled rapidly under the influence of the\nmolecular ray. Then he lowered it to the floor.\n\nIt was obvious that the scientists were impressed, and the Emperor was\ntalking eagerly with the men around him. They talked for several\nminutes, saying nothing to the Earthmen. Torlos stood quietly, waiting\nfor a message to relay.\n\nThe Emperor called out, and some of the guards moved inside the door.\n\nTorlos turned to Arcot. \"Show no emotion!\" came his telepathic warning.\n\"I have been listening to them as they spoke. The Commanding One wants\nyour weapons. Regardless of what his scientists tell him about the\npossibility of your trip, he knows those weapons work, and he wants\nthem.\n\n\"You see, I am not a Satorian at all. I'm from Nansal, sent here many\nyears ago as a spy. I have served in their fleets for many years, and\nhave gained their trust.\n\n\"I am telling you the truth, as you will soon see.\n\n\"These people are going to follow their usual line of action and take\nthe most direct way toward their end. They are going to attack you,\nbelieving that you, despite your weapons, will go down before superior\nnumbers.\n\n\"And you'd better move fast; he's calling the guards already!\"\n\nArcot turned to Morey, his face calm, his heart beating like a\nvibrohammer. \"Keep your face straight, Morey. Don't look surprised.\nThey're planning to jump us. We'll rip out the right wall and--\"\n\nHe stopped. It was too late! The order had been given, and the guards\nwere leaping toward them. Arcot grabbed at his ray pistol, but one of\nthe guards jumped him before he had a chance to draw it.\n\nTorlos seized the man by one leg and an arm and, tensing his huge\nmuscles, hurled him thirty feet against the Commanding One with such\nforce that both were killed instantly! He turned and grabbed another\nbefore his first victim had landed and hurled him toward the advancing\nguards. Arcot thought fleetingly that here was proof of Torlos' story of\nbeing from Nansal; the greater gravity of the third planet made him a\ngreat deal stronger than the Satorians!\n\nOne of the guards was trying to reach for Arcot. Acting instinctively,\nthe Earthman lashed out with a hard jab to the point of the Satorian's\njaw. The iron bones transmitted the shock beautifully to the delicate\nbrain; the man's head jerked back, and he collapsed to the floor.\nArcot's hand felt as though he'd hit it with a hammer, but he was far\ntoo busy to pay any attention to the pain.\n\nMorey, too, had realized the futility of trying to overcome the guards\nby wrestling. The only thing to do was dodge and punch. The guards were\ntrying to take the Earthmen alive, but, because of their greater weight,\nthey couldn't move quite as fast as Arcot and Morey.\n\nTorlos was still in action. He had seen the success of the Earthmen who,\nweak as they were, had been able to knock a man out with a blow to the\njaw. Driving his own fists like pistons, he imitated their blows with\ndeadly results; every man he struck went down forever.\n\nThe dead were piling around him, but through the open door he could see\nreinforcements arriving. Somehow, he had to save these Earthmen; if\nSator got their secrets, Nansal would be lost!\n\nHe reached down and grabbed one of the fallen men and hurled him across\nthe room, smashing back the men who struggled to attack. Then he picked\nup another and followed through with a second projectile. Then a third.\nWith the speed and tirelessness of some giant engine of war, he slammed\nhis macabre ammunition against the oncoming reinforcements with telling\nresults.\n\nAt last Arcot was free for a moment, and that was all he needed. He\njerked his molecular ray pistol from its holster and beamed it\nmercilessly toward the door, hurling the attackers violently backwards.\nThey died instantly, their chilled corpses driving back against their\ncomrades with killing force.\n\nIn a moment, every man in the room was dead except for the two Earthmen\nand the giant Torlos.\n\nOutside the room, they could hear shouted orders as more of the Satorian\nguards were rallied.\n\n\"They'll try to kill us now!\" Arcot said. \"Come on, we've got to get out\nof here!\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Morey, \"but which way?\"\n\n\n\n\nXVII\n\n\n\"Morey, pull down the wall over that door to block their passage,\" Arcot\nordered. \"I'll get the other wall.\"\n\nArcot pointed his pistol and triggered it. The outer wall flew outward\nin an explosion of flying masonry. He switched on his radio and called\n_the Ancient Mariner_.\n\n\"Wade! We were cut off because of the metal in the walls! We've been\ndoublecrossed--they tried to jump us. Torlos warned us in time. We've\ntorn out the wall; just hang outside with the airlock open and wait for\nus. Don't use the rays, because we'll be invisible, and you might hit\nus.\"\n\nSuddenly the room rocked under an explosion, and the debris Morey's ray\nhad torn down over the door was blasted away. A score of men leaped\nthrough the gap before the dust had settled. Morey beamed them down\nmercilessly before they could fire their weapons.\n\n\"In the air, quick!\" Arcot yelled. He turned on his power suit and rose\ninto the air, signalling Torlos to grab his ankles as he had done\nbefore. Morey slammed another parting shot toward the doorway as he\nlifted himself toward the ceiling. Then both Earthmen snapped on their\ninvisibility units. Torlos, because of his direct contact with Arcot,\nalso vanished from sight.\n\nMore of the courageous, but foolhardy Satorians leaped through the\nopening and stared in bewilderment as they saw no one moving. Arcot,\nMorey, and Torlos were hanging invisible in the air above them.\n\nJust then, the shining bulk of the _Ancient Mariner_ drifted into view.\nThey drew back behind the wall and sought shelter. One of them began to\nfire his compressed air gun at it with absolutely no effect; the heavy\nlux walls might as well have been hit by a mosquito.\n\nAs the airlock swung open, Arcot and Morey headed out through the breach\nin the wall. A moment later, they were inside the ship. The heavy door\nhissed closed behind them as they settled to the floor.\n\n\"I'll take the controls,\" Arcot said. \"Morey, head for the rear; you\ntake the moleculars and take Torlos with you to handle the heat beam.\"\nHe turned and ran toward the control room, where Wade and Fuller were\nwaiting. \"Wade, take the forward molecular beams; Fuller, you handle the\nheat projector.\"\n\nArcot strapped himself into the control chair.\n\nSuddenly, there was a terrific explosion, and the titanic mass of the\nship was rocked by the detonation of a bomb one of the men in the\nbuilding had fired at the ship.\n\nTorlos had evidently understood the operation of the heat beam projector\nquickly; the stabbing beam reached out, and the great tower, from floor\nto roof, suddenly leaned over and slumped as the entire side of the\nbuilding was converted into a mass of glowing stone and molten steel.\nThen it crashed heavily to the ground a half mile below.\n\nBut already there were forty of the great battleships rising to meet\nthem.\n\n\"I think we'd better get moving,\" Arcot said. \"We can't let a magnetic\nray touch us now; it would kill Torlos. I'm going to cut in the\ninvisibility units, so don't use the heat beams whatever you do!\"\n\nArcot snapped the ship into invisibility and darted to one side. The\nenemy ships suddenly halted in their wild rush and looked around in\namazement for their opponent.\n\nArcot was heading for the magnetic force field which surrounded the city\nwhen Torlos made a mistake. He turned the powerful heat beam downwards\nand picked off an enemy battleship. It fell, a blazing wreck, but the\nray touched a building behind it, and the ionized air established a\nconducting path between the ship and the planet.\n\nThe apparatus was not designed to make a planet invisible, but it made a\nnoble effort. As a result one of the tubes blew, and the _Ancient\nMariner_ was visible again. Arcot had no time to replace the tube; the\nSatorian fleet kept him too busy.\n\nArcot drove the ship, shooting, twisting upward; Wade and Morey kept\nfiring the molecular beams with precision. The pale rays reached out to\ntouch the battleship, and wherever they touched, the ships went down in\nwreckage, falling to the city below. In spite of the odds against it,\nthe _Ancient Mariner_ was giving a good account of itself.\n\nAnd always, Arcot was working the ship toward the magnetic wall and the\nbase of the city.\n\nSuddenly, giant pneumatic guns from below joined in the battle, hurling\nhuge explosive shells toward the Earth-ship. They managed to hit the\n_Ancient Mariner_ twice, and each time the ship was staggered by the\nforce of the blast, but the foot-thick armor of lux metal ignored the\nexplosions.\n\nThe magnetic rays touched them a few times, and each time Torlos was\nthrown violently to the floor, but the ship was in the path of the beams\nfor so short a time that he was not badly injured. He more than made up\nfor his injuries with the ray he used, and Morey was no mean gunner,\neither, judging from the work he was doing.\n\nThree ships attempted to commit suicide in their efforts to destroy the\nEarthmen. They were only semi-successful; they managed to commit\nsuicide. In trying to crash into the ship, they were simply caught by\nMorey's or Wade's molecular beam and thrown away. Morey actually\ndeveloped a use for them. He caught them in the beam and used them as\nbullets to smash the other ships, throwing them about on the molecular\nray until they were too cold to move.\n\nArcot finally managed to reach the magnetic wall.\n\n\"Wade!\" he called. \"Get that projector building!\"\n\nA molecular beam reached down, and the black metal dome sailed high into\nthe sky, breaking the solidity of the magnetic wall. An instant later,\nthe _Ancient Mariner_ shot through the gap. In a few moments, they would\nbe far away from the city.\n\nTorlos seemed to realize this. Moving quickly, he pushed Morey away from\nthe molecular beam projector, taking the controls away from him.\n\nHe did not realize the power of that ray; he did not know that these\nprojectors could move whole suns out of their orbits. He only knew that\nthey were destructive. They were several miles from the city when he\nturned the projector on it, after twisting the power control up.\n\nTo his amazement, he saw the entire city suddenly leap into the air and\nflash out into space, a howling meteor that vanished into the cloudbank\noverhead. Behind it was a deep hole in the planet's surface, a mighty\nchasm lined with dark granite.\n\nTorlos stared at it in amazement and horror.\n\nArcot turned back slowly, and they sailed over the spot where the city\nhad been. They saw a dozen or so battleships racing away from them to\nspread the news of the disaster; they were the few which had been\nfortunate enough to be outside the city when the beam struck.\n\nArcot maneuvered the ship directly over the mighty pit and sank slowly\ndown, using the great searchlights to illuminate the dark chasm. Far,\nfar down, he could see the solid rock of the bottom. The thing was miles\ndeep.\n\nThen Arcot lifted the ship and headed up through the cloud layer and\ninto the bright light of the great yellow sun, above the sea of gray\nmisty clouds.\n\nArcot signalled Morey, who had come into the control room, to take over\nthe controls of the ship. \"Head out into space, Morey. I want to find\nout why Torlos pulled that last stunt. Wade, will you put a new tube in\nthe invisibility unit?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Wade replied. \"By the way, what happened back there? We were\nsurprised as the very devil to hear you yelling for help; everything\nseemed peaceful up to then.\"\n\nArcot flexed his bruised hands and grinned ruefully. \"Plenty happened.\"\nHe went on to explain to Wade and Fuller what had happened in their\nmeeting with the Satorian Commander.\n\n\"Nice bunch of people to deal with,\" Wade said caustically. \"They tried\nto get everything and lost it all. We would have given them plenty if\nthey'd been decent about it. But what sort of war is this that the\npeople of these two planets are carrying on, anyway?\"\n\n\"That's the question I intend to settle,\" replied Arcot. \"We haven't had\nan opportunity to talk to Torlos yet. He had just admitted to me that he\nwas a spy for Nansal when the fun began, and we've been too busy to ask\nquestions ever since. Come on, let's go into the library.\"\n\nArcot indicated to Torlos that he was to go with him. Wade and Fuller\nfollowed.\n\nWhen they had all seated themselves, Arcot began the telepathic\nquestioning. \"Torlos, why did you force Morey to leave the ray and then\ndestroy the city? You certainly had no reason to kill all the\nnon-combatant women and children in that city, did you? And why, after I\ntold you absolutely not to use the heat beam while we were invisible,\ndid you use the rays on that battleship? You made our invisibility break\ndown and destroyed a tube. Why did you do this?\"\n\n\"I am sorry, man of Earth,\" replied Torlos. \"I can only say that I did\nnot fully understand the effect the rays would have. I did not know how\nlong we would remain invisible; the thing has been accomplished in our\nlaboratories, but only for fractions of a second, and I feared we might\nbecome visible soon. That was one of their latest battleships, equipped\nwith a new, secret, and very deadly weapon. I do not know exactly what\nthe weapon is, but I knew that ship could be deadly against us, and I\nwanted to make sure we were not attacked by it. That is why I used the\nbeam while your ship was invisible.\n\n\"And I did not intend to destroy the city. I was only trying to tear up\nthe factory that builds these battleships; I only wanted to destroy\ntheir machines. I had no conception of the power of that ray. I was as\nhorrified to see the city disappear as you were; I only wanted to\nprotect my people.\" Torlos smiled bitterly. \"I have lived among these\ntreacherous people for many years, and I cannot say that I had no\nprovocation to destroy their city and everyone in it. But I had no\nintention of doing it, Earthman.\"\n\nArcot knew he was sincere. There could be no deception when\ncommunicating telepathically. He wished he had used it when\ncommunicating with the Commanding One of Sator; the trouble would have\nbeen stopped quickly!\n\n\"You still do not have any conception of the magnitude of the power of\nthat beam, Torlos,\" Arcot told him. \"With the rays of this ship, we tore\na sun from its orbit and threw it into another. What you did to that\ncity, we could do to the whole planet. Do not tamper with forces you do\nnot understand, Torlos.\n\n\"There are forces on this ship that would make the energies of your\ngreatest battleship seem weak and futile. We can race through space a\nbillion times faster than the speed of light; we can tear apart and\ndestroy the atoms of matter; we can rip apart the greatest of planets;\nwe can turn the hurtling stars and send them where we want them; we can\ncurve space as we please; we can put out the fires of a sun, if we wish.\n\n\"Torlos, respect the powers of this ship, and do not release its\nenergies unknowingly; they are too great.\"\n\nTorlos looked around him in awe. He had seen the engines--small,\napparently futile things, compared with the solid might of the giant\nengines in his ship--but he had seen explosive charges that he knew\nwould split any ship open from end to end bounce harmlessly from the\nsmooth walls of this ship. He had seen it destroy the fleet of magnetic\nships that had formed a supposedly impregnable guard around the\nmightiest city of Sator.\n\nThen he himself had touched a button, and the giant city had shot off\ninto space, leaving behind it only a screaming tornado and a vast chasm\nin the crust of the blasted planet.\n\nHe could not appreciate the full significance of the velocities Arcot\nhad told him about--he only knew that he had made a bad mistake in\nunderrating the powers of this ship! \"I will not touch these things\nagain without your permission, Earthman,\" Torlos promised earnestly.\n\nThe _Ancient Mariner_ drove on through space, rapidly eating up the\nmillions of miles that separated Nansal from Sator. Arcot sat in the\ncontrol room with Morey discussing their passenger.\n\n\"You know,\" Arcot mused, \"I've been thinking about that man's strength;\nan iron skeleton doesn't explain it all. He has to have muscles to move\nthat skeleton around.\"\n\n\"He's got muscles, all right,\" Morey grinned. \"But I see what you mean;\nmuscles that big should tire easily, and his don't seem to. He seems\ntireless; I watched him throw those men one after another like bullets\nfrom a machine gun. He threw the last one as violently as the first--and\nthose men weighed over three hundred pounds! Apparently his muscles felt\nno fatigue!\"\n\n\"There's another thing,\" pointed out Arcot. \"The way he was breathing\nand the way he seemed to keep so cool. When I got through there, I was\ndripping with sweat; that hot, moist air was almost too much for me. Our\nfriend? Cool as ever, if not more so.\n\n\"And after the fight, he wasn't even breathing heavily!\"\n\n\"No,\" agreed Morey. \"But did you notice him _during_ the fight? He was\nbreathing heavily, deeply, and swiftly--not the shallow, panting breath\nof a runner, but deep and full, yet faster than I can breathe. I could\nhear him breathing in spite of all the noise of the battle.\"\n\n\"I noticed it,\" Arcot said. \"He started breathing _before_ the fight\nstarted. A human being can fight very swiftly, and with tremendous\nvigor, for ten seconds, putting forth his best effort, and only breathe\nonce or twice. For another two minutes, he breathes more heavily than\nusual. But after that, he can't just slow down back to normal. He has\nused up the surplus oxygen in his system, and that has to be replaced;\nhe has run into 'oxygen debt'. He has to keep on breathing hard to get\nback the oxygen surplus his body requires.\n\n\"But not Torlos! No fatigue for him! Why? _Because he doesn't use the\noxygen of the air to do work, and therefore his body is not a chemical\nengine!_\"\n\nMorey nodded slowly. \"I see what you're driving at. His body uses the\nheat energy of the air! His muscles turn heat energy into motion the\nsame way our molecular beams do!\"\n\n\"Exactly--he lives on heat!\" Arcot said. \"I've noticed that he seems\nalmost cold-blooded; his body is at the temperature of the room at all\ntimes. In a sense, he is reptilian, but he's vastly more efficient and\ngreatly different than any reptile Earth ever knew. He eats food, all\nright, but he only needs it to replace his body cells and to fuel his\nbrain.\"\n\n\"Oh, _brother_,\" said Morey softly. \"No wonder he can do the things he\ndid! Why, he could have kept up that fight for hours without getting\ntired! Fatigue is as unknown to him as cold weather. He'd only need\nsleep to replace worn parts. His world is warm and upright on its axis,\nso there are no seasons. He couldn't survive in the Arctic, but he's\nobviously the ideal form of life for the tropics.\"\n\nAs the two men found out later, Morey was wrong on that last point. The\nmen of Torlos' race had a small organ, a mass of cells in the lower\nabdomen which could absorb food from the bloodstream and oxidize it,\nyielding heat, whenever the temperature of the blood dropped below a\ncertain point. Then they could live very comfortably in the Arctic\nzones; they carried their own heaters. Their vast strength was limited\nthen, however, and they were forced to eat more and were more subject to\nfatigue.\n\nWade and Fuller had been trying to speak with Torlos telepathically, and\nhad evidently run into difficulty, for Fuller called into the control\nroom: \"Hey, Arcot, come here a minute! I thought telepathy was a\nuniversal language, but this guy doesn't get our ideas at all! And we\ncan't make out some of his. Just now, he seemed to be thinking of\n'nourishment' or 'food', and I found out he was thinking of 'heat'!\"\n\n\"I'll be right down,\" Arcot told him, heading for the library.\n\nAs he entered, Torlos smiled at him; Arcot picked up his thought easily:\n\"Your friends do not seem to understand my thoughts.\"\n\n\"We are not made as you are,\" Arcot explained, \"and our thought forms\nare different. To you, 'heat' and 'food' are practically the same thing,\nbut we do not think of them as such.\"\n\nHe continued, explaining carefully to Torlos the differences between\ntheir bodies and their methods of using energy.\n\n\"Stone bones!\" Torlos thought in amazement. \"And chemical engines for\nmuscles! No wonder you seem so weak. And yet, with your brains, I would\nhate to have to fight a war with your people!\"\n\n\"Which brings me to another point,\" Arcot continued. \"We would like to\nknow how the war between the people of Sator and the people of Nansal\nbegan. Has it been going on very long?\"\n\nTorlos nodded. \"I will tell you the story. It is a history that began\nmany centuries ago; a history of persecution and rebellion. And yet, for\nall that, I think it an interesting history.\n\n\"Hundreds of years ago, on Nansal ...\"\n\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\n\nHundreds of years ago, on Nansal, there had lived a wise and brilliant\nteacher named Norus. He had developed an ideal, a philosophy of life, a\ncode of ethics. He had taught the principles of nobility without\narrogance, pride without stubbornness, and humility without servility.\n\nAbout him had gathered a group of men who began to develop and spread\nhis ideals. As the new philosophy spread across the planet, more and\nmore Nansalians adopted it and began to raise their children according\nto its tenets.\n\nBut no philosophy, however workable, however noble, can hope to convert\neveryone. There always remains a hard core of men who feel that \"the old\nway is the best way\". In this case, it was the men whose lives had been\nbased on cunning, deceit, and treachery.\n\nOne of these men, a brilliant, but warped genius, named Sator, had built\nthe first spaceship, and he and his men had fled Nansal to set up their\nown government and free themselves from the persecution they believed\nthey suffered at the hands of the believers of Norus.\n\nThey fled to the second planet, where the ship crashed and the builder,\nSator, was killed. For hundreds of years, nothing was heard of the\nemigrants, and the people of Nansal believed them dead. Nansal was at\npeace.\n\nBut the Satorians managed to live on the alien world, and they built a\ncivilization there, a civilization based on an entirely different\nsystem. It was a system of cunning. To them, cunning was right. The man\nwho could plot most cunningly, gain his ends by deceiving his friends\nbest, was the man who most deserved to live. There were a few\nrestrictions; they had loyalty, for one thing--loyalty to their country\nand their world.\n\nIn time, the Satorians rediscovered the space drive, but by this time,\nliving on the new planet had changed them physically. They were somewhat\nsmaller than the Nansalians, and lighter in color, for their world was\nalways sunless. The warm rays of the sun had tanned the skins of the\nNansalians to a darker color.\n\nWhen the Satorians first came to Nansal, it was presumably in peace.\nAfter so many hundreds of years without war, the Nansalians accepted\nthem, and trade treaties were signed. For years, the Satorians traded\npeacefully.\n\nIn the meantime, Satorian spies were working to find the strengths and\nweaknesses of Nansal, searching to discover their secret weapons and\nprocesses, if any. And they rigorously guarded their own secrets. They\nrefused to disclose the secrets of the magnetic beam and the magnetic\nspace drive.\n\nFinally, there were a few of the more suspicious Nansalians who realized\nthe danger in such a situation. There were three men, students in one of\nthe great scientific schools of Nansal, who realized that the situation\nshould be studied. There was no law prohibiting the men of Nansal from\ngoing to Sator, but it seemed that Nature had raised a more impenetrable\nbarrier.\n\nAll Nansalians who went to Sator died of a mysterious disease. A method\nwas found whereby a man's body could be sterilized, bacteriologically\nspeaking, so he could not spread the disease, and this was used on all\nSatorians entering Nansal. But you can't sterilize a whole planet.\nNansalians could not go to Sator.\n\nBut these three men had a different idea. They carefully studied the\nspeech and the mannerisms and customs of the Satorians. They learned to\nimitate the slang and idioms. They went even further; they picked three\nSatorian spaceship navigators and studied them minutely every time they\ngot a chance, in order to learn their habits and their speech patterns.\nThe three Satorians were exceptionally large men, almost perfect doubles\nof the three Nansalians--and, one by one, the Nansalians replaced them.\n\nThey had bleached their faces, and surgeons, working from photographs,\nchanged their features so that the three Nansalians were exact doubles\nof the three astrogators. Then they acted. On three trips, one of the\nmen that went back as navigator was a Nansalian.\n\nIt was six years before they returned to Nansal, but when they finally\ndid, they had learned two things.\n\nIn the first place, the 'disease' which had killed Nansalians who had\ncome in contact with Satorians on Nansal was nothing but a poison which\nacted on contact with the skin. The Nansalians who had gone to Sator had\nsimply been murdered. There was no disease; it had simply been a\nSatorian plot to keep Nansalians from going to Sator.\n\nThe second thing they had learned was the secret of the Satorian\nmagnetic space drive.\n\nIt was common knowledge on Sator that their commander would soon lead\nthem across space to conquer Nansal and settle on a world of clear air\nand cloudless skies, where they could see the stars of space at night.\nThey were waiting only until they could build up a larger fleet and\nlearned all they could from the Nansalians.\n\nThey attacked three years after the three Nansalian spies returned with\ntheir information.\n\nDuring those three years, Nansal had secretly succeeded in building up a\nfleet of the magnetic ships, but it went down quickly before the vastly\ngreater fleet of the Satorians. Their magnetic rays were deadly, killing\neveryone they struck. They could lift the iron-boned Nansalians high\ninto the air, then drop them hundreds of feet to their death.\n\nThe buildings, with their steel and iron frames, went down, crushing\nhundreds of others. They practically depopulated the whole planet.\n\nBut the warnings of the three spies had been in time. They had enlarged\nsome of the great natural caverns and dug others out of solid rock. Here\nthey had built laboratories, factories, and dwelling places far\nunderground, where the Satorians could never find them.\n\nEnough men reached the caverns before the disaster struck to carry on.\nThey had been chosen from the strongest, healthiest, and most\nintelligent that Nansal had. They lived there for over a century, while\nthe planet was overrun by the conquerors and the cities were rebuilt by\nthe Satorians.\n\nDuring this century, the magnetic ray shield was developed by the hidden\nNansalians. Daring at last to face their conquerors, they built a city\non the surface and protected it with the magnetic force screen.\n\nBy the time the Satorians found the city, it was too late. A battle\nfleet was mobilized and rushed to the spot, but the city was\nimpregnable. The great domed power stations were already in operation,\nand they were made of nonmagnetic materials, so they could not be pulled\nfrom the ground. The magnetic beams were neutralized by the shield, and\nno ship could pass through it without killing every man aboard.\n\nThat first city was a giant munitions plant. The Nansalians built\nfactories there and laughed while the armies of Sator raged impotently\nat the magnetic barrier. They tried sending missiles through, but the\ninduction heating in every metal part of the bombs either caused them to\nexplode instantly or to drop harmlessly and burn.\n\nIn the meantime, the men of Nansal were building their fleet. The\nSatorians stepped up production, too, but the Nansalians had developed a\nmethod of projecting the magnetic screen. Any approaching Satorian ship\nhad its magnetic support cut from under it, and it crashed to the\nground.\n\nIt took nearly thirty years of hard work and harder fighting for the\nNansalians to convince the people of Sator that Nansal and the\nphilosophy of Norus had not only not been wiped out, but was capable of\nwiping out the Satorians.\n\nWith their screened and protected fleet, the followers of Norus smashed\nthe Satorian cities, and drove their enemy back to Sator.\n\nThere were only three enemy cities left on Nansal when, somehow, they\nmanaged to learn the secret of the magnetic screen.\n\nBy this time, the forces of Nansal had increased tremendously, and they\ndeveloped the next surprise for the Satorians. One after another, the\nthree remaining cities were destroyed by a barrage of poison gas.\n\nThe fleet of Sator tried to retaliate, but the Nansalians were prepared\nfor them. Every building had been sealed and filters had been built into\nthe air conditioning systems.\n\nShortly, the men of Nansal were again in control of their planet, and\nthe fleet stood guard over the planet.\n\nThe Satorians, beaten technologically, were still not ready to give up.\nFalling back on their peculiar philosophy of life, they pulled a trick\nthe Nansalians would never have thought of. They sued for peace.\n\nThe government of Nansal was willing; they had had enough of bloodshed.\nThey permitted a delegation to arrive. The ship was escorted into the\ncity and the parleying began.\n\nThe Satorian delegation asked for absolutely unreasonable terms. They\ndemanded fleet bases on Nansal; they demanded an unreasonable rate of\nexchange between the two powers, one which would be highly favorable to\nSator; they wanted to impose fantastic restrictions on Nansalian travel\nand none whatsoever on their own.\n\nMonth followed month and months became years as the diplomats of Nansal\ntried, patiently and logically, to show the Satorians how unreasonable\ntheir demands were.\n\nNot once did they suspect that the Satorians had no intention of trying\nto get the conditions they asked for. Their sole purpose was to drag the\nparleying on and on, bickering, quarreling, demanding, and conceding\njust enough to give the Nansalians hope that a treaty might eventually\nbe consummated.\n\nAnd during all that time, the factories of Sator were working furiously\nto build the greatest fleet that had ever crossed the space between the\ntwo planets!\n\nWhen they were ready to attack, the Satorian delegation told Nansal\nfrankly that they would not treaty with them. The day the delegation\nleft, the Satorian fleet swept down upon Nansal!\n\nThe Nansalians were again beaten back into their cities, safe behind\ntheir magnetic screens, but unable to attack. But the forces of Sator\nhad not won easily--they had, in fact, not won at all. Their supply line\nwas too long and their fleet had suffered greatly at the hands of the\ndefenders of Nansal.\n\nFor a long while, the balance of power was so nearly equal that neither\nside dared attack.\n\nThen the balance again swung toward Nansal. A Nansalian scientist\ndiscovered a compact method of storing power. Oddly enough, it was\nsimilar to the method Dr. Richard Arcot had discovered a hundred\nthousand light centuries away! It did not store nearly the power, and\nwas inefficient, but it was a great improvement over their older method\nof generating energy in the ship itself.\n\nThe Nansalian ships could be made smaller, and lighter, and more\nmaneuverable, and at the same time could be equipped with heavier, more\npowerful magnetic beam generators.\n\nVery shortly, the Satorians were again at the mercy of Nansal. They\ncould not fight the faster, more powerful ships of the Nansalians, and\nagain they went down in defeat.\n\nAnd again they sued for peace.\n\nThis time, Nansal knew better; they went right on developing their fleet\nwhile the diplomats of Sator argued.\n\nBut the Satorians weren't fools; they didn't expect Nansal to swallow\nthe same bait a second time. Sator had another ace up her sleeve.\n\nTen days after they arrived, every diplomat and courier of the Satorian\ndelegation committed suicide!\n\nPuzzled, the government of Nansal reported the deaths to Sator at once,\nexpecting an immediate renewal of hostilities; they were quite sure that\nSator assumed they had been murdered. Nansal was totally unprepared for\nwhat happened; Sator acknowledged the message with respects and said\nthey would send a new commission.\n\nTwo days later, Nansal realized it had been tricked again. A horrible\ndisease broke out and spread like wildfire. The incubation period was\ntwelve days; during that time it gave no sign. Then the flesh began to\nrot away, and the victim died within hours. No wonder the ambassadors\nhad committed suicide!\n\nMillions died, including Torlos' own father, during the raging epidemic\nthat followed. But, purely by lucky accident, the Nansalian medical\nresearch teams came up with a cure and a preventive inoculation before\nthe disease had spread over the whole planet.\n\nSator's delegation had inoculated themselves with the disease and, at\nthe sacrifice of their own lives, had spread it on Nansal. Although the\nSatorians had developed the horribly virulent strain of virus, they had\nnot found a cure; the diplomats knew they were going to die.\n\nHaving managed to stop the disease before it swept the planet, the\nNansalians decided to pull a trick of their own. Radio communication\nwith Sator was cut off in such a way as to lead the Satorian government\nto believe that Nansal was dying of the disease.\n\nThe scientists of Sator knew that the virus was virulent; in fact, too\nvirulent for its own good. It killed the host every time, and the virus\ncould not live outside a living cell. They knew that shortly after every\nNansalian died, the virus, too, would be dead.\n\nTheir fleet started for Nansal six months after radio contact had broken\noff. Expecting to find Nansal a dead planet, they were totally\nunprepared to find them alive and ready for the attack. The Satorian\nfleet, vastly surprised to find a living, vigorous enemy, was totally\nwiped out.\n\nSince that time, both planets had remained in a state of armed truce.\nNeither had developed any weapon which would enable them to gain an\nadvantage over their enemy. Each was so spy-infested that no move could\npass undiscovered.\n\nStalemate.\n\n\n\n\nXIX\n\n\nTorlos spread his hands eloquently. \"That is the history of our war. Can\nyou wonder that my people were suspicious when your ship appeared? Can\nyou wonder that they drove you away? They were afraid of the men of\nSator; when they saw your weapons, they were afraid for their\ncivilization.\n\n\"On the other hand, why should the men of Sator fear? They knew that our\ncode of honor would not permit us to make a treacherous attack.\n\n\"I regret that my people drove you away, but can you blame them?\"\n\nArcot had to admit that he could not. He turned to Morey. \"They were\ncertainly reasonable in driving us from their cities; experience has\ntaught them that it's the safest way. A good offense is always the best\ndefense.\n\n\"But experience has taught me that, unlike Torlos, I have to eat. I\nwonder if it might not be a good idea to get a little rest too--I'm\nbushed.\"\n\n\"Good idea,\" agreed Morey. \"I'll ask Wade to stand guard while we sleep.\nIf Torlos wants company, he can talk to Wade as well as anyone. I'm due\nfor some sleep myself.\"\n\nArcot, Morey, and Fuller went to their rooms for some rest. Arcot and\nMorey were tired, but after an hour, Fuller rose and went down to the\ncontrol room where Wade was communicating telepathically with Torlos.\n\n\"Hello,\" Wade greeted him. \"I thought you were going to join the\nSnoring Chorus.\"\n\n\"I tried to, but I couldn't get in tune. What have you been doing?\"\n\n\"I've been talking with Torlos--and with fair success. I'm getting the\ntrick of thought communication,\" Wade said enthusiastically. \"I asked\nTorlos if he wanted to sleep, and it seems that they do it regularly,\none day in ten. And when they sleep, they sleep soundly. It's more of a\ncoma, something like the hibernation of a bear or a possum.\n\n\"If you want to do business with Mr. John Doe, and he happens to be\nasleep, your business will have to wait. It takes something really\ndrastic to wake these people up.\n\n\"I remember a remark one of my classmates made while I was going to\ncollege. He was totally unconscious of the humor in the thing. He said:\n'I've got to go to more lectures. I've been losing a lot of sleep.'\n\n\"He intended them to be totally disconnected thoughts, but the rest of\nus knew his habits, and we almost knocked ourselves out laughing.\n\n\"I was just wondering what would happen if a Nansalian were to drop off\nin class. They'd probably have to call an ambulance or something to\ncarry him home!\"\n\nFuller looked at the giant. \"I doubt it. One of his classmates would\njust tuck him under his arm and take him on home--or to the next\nlecture. Remember, they only weigh about four hundred pounds on Nansal,\nwhich is no more to them than fifty pounds is to us.\"\n\n\"True enough,\" Wade agreed. \"But you know, I'd hate to have him wrap\nthose arms of his about me. He might get excited, or sneeze or\nsomething, and--_squish!_\"\n\n\"You and your morbid imagination.\" Fuller sat down in one of the seats.\n\"Let's see if we can't get a three-way conversation going; this guy is\ninteresting.\"\n\nArcot and Morey awoke nearly three hours later, and the Earthmen ate\ntheir breakfast, much to Torlos' surprise.\n\n\"I can understand that you need far more food than we do,\" he commented,\n\"but you only ate a few hours ago. It seems like a tremendous amount of\nfood to me. How could you possibly grow enough in your cities?\"\n\n\"So _that's_ why they don't have any farms!\" Fuller said.\n\n\"Our food is grown out on the plains outside the cities, where there is\nroom,\" Arcot explained. \"It's difficult, but we have machines to help\nus. We could never have developed the cone type of city you have,\nhowever, for we need huge huge quantities of food. If we were to seal\nourselves inside our cities as your people have to protect themselves\nfrom enemies, we would starve to death very quickly.\"\n\n\"You know,\" Morey said, \"I'll have to admit that Torlos' people are a\nhigher type of creation than we are. Man, and all other animals on\nEarth, are parasites of the plant world. We're absolutely incapable of\nproducing our own foods. We can't gather energy for ourselves. We're\nutterly dependent on plants.\n\n\"But these men aren't--at least not so much so. They at least generate\ntheir own muscular energy by extracting heat from the air they breathe.\nThey combine all the best features of plants, reptiles, and mammals. I\ndon't know where they'd be classified biologically!\"\n\nAfter the meal, they went to the control room and strapped themselves\ninto the control seats. Arcot checked the fuel gauge.\n\n\"We have plenty of lead left,\" he said to Morey, \"and Torlos has assured\nme that we will be able to get more on Nansal. I suggest we show him how\nthe space control works, so that he can tell the Nansalian scientists\nabout it from personal experience.\n\n\"In this sun's gravitational field, we'll lose a lot of power, but as\nlong as it can be replaced, we're all right.\"\n\nTurning to the Nansalian, Arcot pointed out towards the little spark of\nlight that was Torlos' home planet. \"Keep your eyes on that, Torlos.\nWatch it grow when we use our space control drive.\"\n\nArcot pushed the little red switch to the first notch. The air around\nthem pulsed with power for an instant, then space had readjusted itself.\n\nThe point that was Nansal grew to a disc, and then it was swiftly\nleaping toward them, welling up to meet them, expanding its bulk with\nawesome speed. Torlos watched it tensely.\n\nThere was a sudden splintering crash, and Arcot jerked open the circuit\nin alarm. They were almost motionless again as the stars reeled about\nthem.\n\nTorlos had been nervous. Like any man so effected, he had unconsciously\ntightened his muscles. His fingers had sunk into the hard plastic of the\narm rest on his chair, and crushed it as though it had been put between\nthe jaws of a hydraulic press!\n\n\"I'm glad we weren't holding hands,\" said Wade, eyeing the broken\nplastic.\n\n\"I am very sorry,\" Torlos thought humbly. \"I did not intend to do that.\nI forgot myself when I saw that planet rushing at me so fast.\" His\nchagrin was apparent on his face.\n\nArcot laughed. \"It is nothing, Torlos. We are merely astonished at the\nterrific strength of your hand. Wade wasn't worried; he was joking!\"\n\nTorlos looked relieved, but he looked at the splintered arm rest and\nthen at his hand. \"It is best that I keep my too-strong hands away from\nyour instruments.\"\n\nThe ship was falling toward Nansal at a relatively slow rate, less than\nfour miles a second. Arcot accelerated toward the planet for two hours,\nthen began to decelerate. Five hundred miles above the planet's surface,\ntheir velocity cut the ship into a descending spiral orbit to allow the\natmosphere to check their speed.\n\nThe outer lux hull began to heat up, and he closed the relux screens to\ncut down the radiation from it. When he opened them again, the ship was\nspeeding over the broad plains of the planet.\n\nTorlos told Arcot that by far the greater percentage of the surface of\nNansal was land. There was still plenty of water, for their seas were\nmuch deeper than those of Earth. Some of the seas were thirty miles deep\nover broad areas--hundreds of square miles. As if to compensate, the\nland surfaces were covered with titanic mountain ranges, some of them\nover ten miles above sea level.\n\nTorlos, his eyes shining, directed the Earthmen to his home city, the\ncapital of the world-nation.\n\n\"Is there no traffic between the cities here, Torlos?\" Morey asked. \"We\nhaven't seen any ships.\"\n\n\"There's continuous traffic,\" Torlos replied, \"but you have come in far\nto the north, well away from the regularly scheduled routes. The\ncommerce must be densely populated with warships as well, and both\nwarships and commercial craft are made to look as much alike as possible\nso that the enemy can not know when ships of war are present and when\nthey are not, and their attacks are more easily beaten off. They are\nforced to live off our commerce while they are here. Before we invented\nthe magnetic storage device, they were forced to get fuel from our ships\nin order to make the return journey; they could not carry enough for the\nround trip.\"\n\nSuddenly his smile broadened, and he pointed out the forward window.\n\"Our city is behind that next range of mountains!\"\n\nThey were flying at a height of twenty miles, and the range Torlos\nindicated was far off in the blue distance, almost below the horizon. As\nthey approached them, the mountains seemed to change slowly as their\nperspective shifted. They seemed to crawl about on one another like\nliving things, growing larger and changing from blue to blue-green, and\nthen to a rich, verdant emerald.\n\nSoon the ship was rocketing smoothly over them. Ahead and below, in the\nrocky gorge of the mountains, lay a great cone city, the largest the\nEarthmen had yet seen. As they approached, they could see another cone\nbehind it--the city was a double cone! They resembled the circus tents\nof two centuries earlier, connected by a ridge.\n\n\"Ah--home!\" smiled Torlos. \"See--that twin cone idea is new. It was not\nthus when I left it, years ago. It is growing, growing--and in that new\nsection! See? They have bright colors on all the buildings! And already\nthey are digging foundations out to the left for a third cone!\" He was\nso excited that it was difficult for Arcot to read his thoughts\ncoherently.\n\n\"But we won't have to build more fortifications,\" Torlos continued, \"if\nyou will give us the secret of the rays you use!\n\n\"But, Arcot, you must hide in the hills now; drop down and deposit me in\nthe hills. I will walk to the city on foot.\n\n\"I will be able to identify myself, and I will soon be inside the city,\ntelling the Supreme Three that I have salvation and peace for them!\"\n\n\"I have a better idea,\" Arcot told him. \"It will save you a long walk.\nWe'll make the ship invisible, and take you close to the city. You can\ndrop, say ten feet from the ship to the ground, and continue from there.\nWill that be all right?\"\n\nTorlos agreed that it would.\n\nInvisible, the _Ancient Mariner_ dove down toward the city, stopping\nonly a few hundred feet from the base of the magnetic wall, near one of\nthe gigantic beam stations.\n\n\"I will come out in a one-man flier, slowly, and at low altitude, toward\nthat mountain there,\" Torlos told Arcot, pointing. \"Then you may become\nvisible and follow me into the city.\n\n\"You need fear no treachery from my people,\" he assured them. Then,\nsmiling: \"As if you need fear treachery from the hands of any people!\nYou have certainly proven your ability to defend yourselves!\n\n\"Even if my people were treacherously inclined, they would certainly\nhave been convinced by your escape from the Satorians. And they have\nundoubtedly heard all about it by now through the secret radios of our\nspies. After all, I was not the only Nansalian spy there, and some of\nthe others must surely have escaped in the ships that ran away after I\ndestroyed the city.\" Arcot could feel the sadness in his mind as he\nthought of the fact that his inadvertent destruction of the city had\nundoubtedly killed some of his own people.\n\nTorlos paused a moment, then asked: \"Is there any message you wish me to\ngive the Supreme Council of Three?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Arcot. \"Repeat to them the offer we so foolishly made to\nthe Commanding One of Sator. We will give them the molecular ray which\ntore the city out of the ground, and, as your people have seen, also\ntore a mountain down. We will give them our heat beam, which will melt\nanything except the material of which this ship is made. And we will\ngive them the knowledge to make this material, too.\n\n\"Best of all, we will give them the secret of the most terrific energy\nsource known to mankind; the energy of matter itself. With these in your\nhands, Sator will soon be peaceful.\n\n\"In return, we ask only two things. They will cost you almost nothing,\nbut they are invaluable to us. We have lost our way. In the vastness of\nspace, we can no longer locate our own galaxy. But our own Island\nUniverse has features which could be distinguished on an astronomical\nplate, and we have taken photographs of it which your astronomers can\ncompare with their own to help us find our way back.\n\n\"In addition, we need more fuel--lead wire. Our space control drive does\nnot use up energy except in the presence of a strong gravitational\nfield; most of it is drained back into our storage coils, with very\nlittle loss. But we have used it several times near a large sun, and the\npower drainage goes up exponentially. We would not have enough to get\nback home if we happened to run into any more trouble on the way.\"\n\nArcot paused a moment, considering. \"Those two things are all we really\nneed, but we would like to take back more, if your Council is willing.\nWe would like samples of your books and photographs and other artifacts\nof your civilization to take back home to our own people.\n\n\"That, and peace, are all we ask.\"\n\nTorlos nodded. \"The things you ask, I am sure the Council will readily\nagree to. It seems little enough payment for the things you intend to do\nfor us.\"\n\n\"Very well, then. We will wait for you. Good luck!\"\n\nTorlos turned and jumped out of the airlock. The ship rose high above\nhim as he suddenly became visible on the plain below. He was running\ntoward the city in great leaps of twenty feet--graceful, easy leaps that\nshowed his tremendous power.\n\nSuddenly, a ship was darting down from the city toward him. As it curved\ndown, Torlos stopped and made certain signals with his arms, then he\nstood quietly with his hands in the air.\n\nThe ship hovered above him, and two men dropped thirty feet to the\nground and questioned him for several minutes.\n\nFinally, they motioned to the ship, which dropped to ten feet, and the\nthree men leaped lightly to its door and entered. The door snapped shut,\nand the ship shot toward the city. The magnetic wall opened for a\nmoment, and the ship shot through. Within seconds, if was out of sight,\nlost in the busy air traffic above the city.\n\n\"Well,\" said Arcot, \"now we go back to the hills and wait.\"\n\n\n\n\nXX\n\n\nFor two days, the _Ancient Mariner_ lay hidden in the hills. It was\nvisible all that time, but at least two of the men were watching the sky\nevery hour of the day. Torlos himself was, they knew, perfectly\ntrustworthy, but they did not know whether his people were as honorable\nas he claimed them to be.\n\nArcot and Wade were in the control room on the afternoon of the second\nday--not Earth days, but the forty-hour Nansalian days--and they had\nbeen quietly discussing the biological differences between themselves\nand the inhabitants of this planet.\n\nSuddenly, Wade saw a slowly moving speck in the sky.\n\n\"Look, Arcot! There's Torlos!\"\n\nThey waited, ready for any hostile action as the tiny ship approached\nrapidly, circling slowly downward as it came nearer. It landed a few\nhundred feet away, and Torlos emerged, running rapidly toward the Earth\nship. Arcot let him in through the airlock.\n\nTorlos smiled broadly. \"I had difficulty in convincing the Council that\nmy story was true. When I told them that you could go faster than light,\nthey strongly objected. But they had to admit that you had certainly\nbeen able to tear down the mountain very effectively, and they had\nreceived reports of the destruction of the Satorian capitol.\n\n\"It seems you first visited the city of Thanso when you came here. The\npeople were nearly panic-stricken when they saw you rip that mountain\ndown and uproot the magnetic ray station. No one ship had ever done that\nbefore!\n\n\"But the fact that several guards had seen me materialize out of thin\nair, plus the fact that they knew you could make yourselves invisible,\nconvinced them that my story was true.\n\n\"They want to talk to you, and they say that they will gladly grant your\nrequests. But you must promise them one thing--you must stay away from\nany of our people, for they are afraid of disease. Bacteria that do not\nbother you very much might be deadly to us. The Supreme Council of Three\nis willing to take the risk, but they will not allow anyone else to be\nexposed.\"\n\n\"We will keep apart from your people if the Council wishes,\" Arcot\nagreed, \"but there is no real danger. We are so vastly different from\nyou that it will be impossible for you to get our diseases, or for us to\ncontract yours. However, if the Council wants it, we will do as they\nask.\"\n\nTorlos at once went back to his ship and headed toward the city.\n\nArcot followed in the _Ancient Mariner_, keeping about three hundred\nfeet to the rear.\n\nWhen they reached the magnetic screen of the city, one of the beam\nstations cut its power for a few moments, leaving a gap for the two\nships to glide smoothly through.\n\nOn the roofs of the buildings, men and women were collected, watching\nthe shining, polished hull of the strange ship as it moved silently\nabove them.\n\nTorlos led them to the great central building and dropped to the huge\nlanding field beside it. All around them, in regular rows, the great\nhulls of the Nansal battleships were arranged. Arcot landed the _Ancient\nMariner_ and shut off the power.\n\n\"I think Wade is the man to go with me this time,\" Arcot said. \"He has\nlearned to communicate with Torlos quite well. We will each carry both\npistols and wear our power suits. And we'll be in radio communication\nwith you at all times.\n\n\"I don't think they'll start anything we don't like this time, but I'm\nnot as confident as I was, and I'm not going to take any useless\nchances. This time I'm going to make arrangements. If I die here,\nthere's going to be a very costly funeral, and these men are going to\npay the costs!\n\n\"I'll call you every three minutes, Morey. If I don't, check up on me.\nIf you still don't get an answer, take this place apart because you\nwon't be able to hurt us then.\n\n\"I'm going to tell Torlos about our precautions. If the building shields\nthe radio, I'll be listening for you and I'll retrace my steps until I\ncan contact you again. Right? Then come on, Wade!\" Arcot, fully\nequipped, strode down the corridor to the airlock.\n\nTorlos was waiting for them with another man, whom Torlos explained was\na high-ranking officer of the fleet. Torlos, it seemed, was without\nofficial rank. He was a secret service agent without official status,\nand therefore an officer had been assigned to accompany the Earthmen.\n\nTorlos seemed to be relaxing in the soft, warm sunlight of his native\nworld. It had been years since he had seen that yellow sun except from\nthe windows of a space flier. Now he could walk around in the clear air\nof the planet of his birth.\n\nArcot explained to him the precautions they had taken against trouble\nhere, and Torlos smiled. \"You have certainly learned greater caution. I\ncan't blame you. We certainly seem little different from the men of\nSator; we can only stand on trial. But I know you will be safe.\"\n\nThey walked across the great court, which was covered with a soft,\nspringy turf of green. The hot sun shining down on them, the brilliant\ncolors of the buildings, the towering walls of the magnificent edifice\nthey were approaching, and, behind them, the shining hull of the\n_Ancient Mariner_ set among the dark, needle-shaped Nansalian ships, all\ncombined to make a picture that would remain in their minds for a long\ntime.\n\nHere, there were no guards watching them as they were conducted to the\nmeeting of the Supreme Council of Three.\n\nThey went into the main entrance of the towering government building and\nstepped into the great hall on the ground floor. It was like the\ninterior of an ancient Gothic cathedral, beautiful and dignified. Great\npillars of green stone rose in graceful, fluted columns, smoothly\ncurving out like the branches of some stylized tree to meet in arches\nthat rose high in pleasing curves to a point midway between four\npillars. The walls were made of a dark green stone as a background; on\nthem had been traced designs in colored tile.\n\nThe whole hall was a thing of colored beauty; the color gave it life, as\nthe yellow sunlight gave life to the trees of the mountains.\n\nThey crossed the great hall and came at last to the elevator. Its door\nwas made of narrow strips of metal, so bound together that the whole\nmade a flexible, but strong sheet. In principle, the doors worked like\nthe cover of an antique roll-top desk. The idea was old, but these men\nhad made their elevator doors very attractive by the addition of color.\nIn no way did they detract from the dignified grace of the magnificent\nhall.\n\nTorlos turned to Arcot. \"I wonder if it would not be wise to shut off\nyour radio as we enter the elevator. Might not the magnetic force affect\nit?\"\n\n\"Probably,\" Arcot agreed. He contacted Morey and told him that the radio\nwould be cut off for a short while. \"But it won't be more than three\nminutes,\" Arcot finished. \"If it is--you know what to do.\"\n\nAs they entered the elevator, Torlos smiled at the two Earthmen. \"We\nwill ascend more gradually this time, so that the acceleration won't be\nso tiring to you.\" He moved the controls carefully, and by gentle steps\nthey rose to the sixty-third floor of the giant building.\n\nAs they stepped out of the elevator, Torlos pointed toward an open\nwindow that stretched widely across one wall. Below them, they could see\nthe _Ancient Mariner_.\n\n\"Your radio contact should be good,\" Torlos commented.\n\nWade put in a call to Morey, and to his relief, he made contact\nimmediately.\n\nThe officer was leading them down a green stone corridor toward a simple\ndoor. He opened it, and they entered the room beyond.\n\nIn the center of the room was a large triangular table. At a place at\nthe center of each side sat one man on a slightly raised chair, while on\neach side of him sat a number of other men.\n\nTorlos stopped at the door and saluted. Then he spoke in rapid, liquid\nsyllables to the men sitting at the table, halting once or twice and\nshowing evident embarrassment as he did so.\n\nHe paused, and one of the three men in command replied rapidly in a\npleasant voice that had none of the harsh command that Arcot had noticed\nin the voice of the Satorian Commanding One. Arcot liked the voice and\nthe man.\n\nJudging by Earth standards, he was past middle age--whatever that might\nbe on Nansal--with crisp black hair that was bleaching slightly. His\nface showed the signs of worry that the making of momentous decisions\nalways leaves, but although the face was strong with authority, there\nwas a gentleness that comes with a feeling of kindly power.\n\nWade was talking rapidly into the radio, describing the scene before\nthem to Morey. He described the great table of dark wood, and the men\nabout it, some in the blue uniform of the military, and some in the\nloose, soft garments of the civilian. Their colored fabrics,\nindividually in good taste and harmony, were frequently badly out of\nharmony with the costume of a neighbor, a difficulty accompanying this\nbrightly tinted clothing.\n\nTorlos turned to Arcot. \"The Supreme council asks that you be seated at\nthe table, in the places left for you.\" He paused, then quickly added:\n\"I have told them of your precautions, and they have said: 'A wise man,\nhaving been received treacherously once, will not again be trapped.'\nThey approve of your policy of caution.\n\n\"The men who sit at the raised portions of the table are the Supreme\nThree; the others are their advisors who know the details of Science,\nBusiness, and War. No one man can know all the branches of human\nendeavor, and this is but a meeting place of those who know best the\nindividual lines. The Supreme Three are elected from the advisors in\ncase of the death of one of the Three, and they act as co-ordinators for\nthe rest.\n\n\"The man of Science is to your left; directly before you is the man of\nBusiness, and to your right is the Commander of the Military.\n\n\"To whom do you wish to speak first?\"\n\nArcot considered for a moment, then: \"I must first tell the Scientist\nwhat it is I have, then tell the Commander how he can use it, and\nfinally I will tell the Businessman what will be needed.\"\n\nArcot had noticed that the military officers all wore holsters for their\npneumatic pistols, but they were conspicuously empty. He was both\npleased and embarrassed. What should he do--he, who carried two deadly\npistols. He decided on the least conspicuous course and left them where\nthey were.\n\nArcot projected his thoughts at Torlos. \"We have come a vast distance\nacross space, from another galaxy. Let your astronomer tell them what\ndistance that represents.\"\n\nArcot paused while Torlos put the thoughts into the words of the\nNansalian language. A moment later, one of the scientists, a tall,\npowerfully built man, even for these men of giant strength, rose and\nspoke to the others. When he was seated, a second rose and spoke also,\nwith an expression of puzzled wonder.\n\n\"He says,\" Torlos translated, \"that his science has taught him that a\nspeed such as you say you have made is impossible, but the fact that you\nare here proves his science wrong.\n\n\"He reasoned that since your kind live on no planet of this system, you\nmust come from another star. Since his science says that this is just as\nimpossible as coming from another galaxy, he is convinced of the fallacy\nin the theories.\"\n\nArcot smiled. The sound reasoning was creditable; the man did not label\nas \"impossible\" something which was proven by the presence of the two\nEarthmen.\n\nArcot tried to explain the physical concepts behind his space-strain\ndrive, but communication broke down rapidly; Torlos, a warrior, not a\nscientist, could not comprehend the ideas, and was completely unable to\ntranslate them into his own language.\n\n\"The Chief Physicist suggests that you think directly at him,\" Torlos\nfinally told Arcot. \"He suggests that the thoughts might be more\nfamiliar to him than to me.\" He grinned. \"And they certainly aren't\nclear to me!\"\n\nArcot projected his thoughts directly toward the physicist; to his\nsurprise, the man was a perfect receiver. He had a natural gift for it.\nQuickly, Arcot outlined the system that had made his intergalactic\nvoyage possible.\n\nThe physicist smiled when Arcot was finished, and tried to reply, but he\nwas not a good transmitter. Torlos aided him.\n\n\"He says that the science of your people is far ahead of us. The\nconceptions are totally foreign to his mind, and he can only barely\ngrasp the significance of the idea of bent emptiness that you have given\nhim. He says, however, that he can fully appreciate the possibility that\nyou have shown him. He has given your message to the Three, and they are\nanxious to hear of the weapons you have.\"\n\nArcot drew the molecular pistol, and holding it up for all to see,\nprojected the general theory of its operation toward the physicist.\n\nTo the Chief Physicist of Nansal, the idea of molecular energy was an\nold one; he had been making use of it all his life, and it was well\nknown that the muscles used the heat of air to do their work. He\nunderstood well how it worked, but not until Arcot projected into his\nmind the mental impression of how the Earthmen had thrown one sun into\nanother did he realize the vast power of the ray.\n\nAwed, the man translated the idea to his fellows.\n\nThen Arcot drew the heat pistol and explained how the annihilation of\nmatter within it was converted into pure heat by the relux lens.\n\n\"I will show you how they work,\" Arcot continued. \"Could we have a lump\nof metal of some kind?\"\n\nThe Scientist spoke into an intercom microphone, and within a few\nminutes, a large lump of iron--a broken casting--was brought in. Arcot\nsuspended it on the molecular beam while Wade melted it with the heat\nbeam. It melted and collapsed into a ball that glowed brilliantly and\nflamed as its surface burned in the oxygen of the air. Wade cut off his\nheat ray, and the ball quickly cooled under the influence of the\nmolecular beam until Arcot lowered it to the floor, a perfect sphere\ncrusted with ice and frost.\n\nArcot continued for the better part of an hour to explain to the Council\nexactly what he had, how they could be used, and what materials and\nprocesses were needed to make them.\n\nWhen he was finished, the Supreme Three conferred for several minutes.\nThen the Scientist asked, through Torlos: \"How can we repay you for\nthese things you have given us?\"\n\n\"First, we need lead to fuel our ship.\" Arcot gave them the exact\nspecifications for the lead wire they needed.\n\nHe received his answer from the man of Business and Manufacturing. \"We\ncan give you that easily, for lead is cheap. Indeed, it seems hardly\nenough to repay you.\"\n\n\"The second thing we need,\" Arcot continued, \"is information. We became\nlost in space and are unable to find our way home. I would like to\nexplain the case to the Astronomer.\"\n\nThe Astronomer proved to be a man of powerful intelligence as well as\npowerful physique, and was a better transmitter than receiver. It took\nevery bit of Arcot's powerful mind to project his thoughts to the man.\n\nHe explained the dilemma that he and his friends were in, and told him\nhow he could recognize the Galaxy on his plates. The Astronomer said he\nthought he knew of such a nebula, but he would like to compare his own\nphotographs with Arcot's to make sure.\n\n\"In return,\" Arcot told him, \"we will give you another weapon--a weapon,\nthis time, to defeat the astronomer's greatest enemy, distance. It is an\nelectrical telescope which will permit you to see life on every planet\nof this system. With it, you can see a man at a distance ten times as\ngreat as the distance from Nansal to your sun!\"\n\nEagerly, the Astronomer questioned Arcot concerning the telectroscope,\nbut others were clamoring for Arcot's attention.\n\nThe Biologist was foremost among the contenders; he seemed worried about\nthe possibility of the alien Earthmen carrying pathogenic bacteria.\n\n\"Torlos has told us that you have an entirely different internal\norganization. What is it that is different? I can't believe that he has\ncorrectly understood you.\"\n\nArcot explained the differences as carefully as possible. By the time he\nwas finished, the Biologist felt sure that any such creature was\nsufficiently far removed from them to be harmless biologically, but he\nwanted to study the Man of Earth further.\n\nArcot had brought along a collection of medical books as a possible aid\nin case of accident. He offered to give these to Nansal in exchange for\na collection of Nansalian medical texts. The English would have to be\nworked out with the aid of a dictionary and a primary working aid which\nArcot would supply. Arcot also asked for a skeleton to take with him,\nand the Biologist readily agreed.\n\n\"We'd like to give you one in return,\" Arcot grinned, \"But we only\nbrought four along, and, unfortunately, we are using them at the\nmoment.\"\n\nThe Biologist smiled back and assured him that they would not think of\ntaking a piece of apparatus so vitally necessary to the Earthmen.\n\nThe Military Leader was the man who demanded attention next. Arcot had a\nlong conference with him, and they decided that the best way for the\nMilitary Leader to learn the war potential of the _Ancient Mariner_ was\nto personally see a demonstration of its powers.\n\nThe Council decided that the Three would go on the trip. The Military\nCommander picked two of his aides to go, and the Scientist picked the\nAstronomer and the Physicist. The head of Business and Manufacturing\ndeclined to bring any of his advisors.\n\n\"We would learn nothing,\" he told Arcot, \"and would only be in the way.\nI, myself, am going only because I am one of the Three.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Arcot. \"Let's get started.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXI\n\n\nThe party descended to the ground floor and walked out to the ship. They\nfiled into the airlock, and in the power room they looked in amazement\nat the tiny machines that ran the ship. The long black cylinder of the\nmain power unit for the molecular drive looked weak and futile compared\nto the bulky machines that ran their own ships. The power storage coils,\nwith their fields of intense, dead blackness, interested the Physicist\nimmensely.\n\nThe ship was a constant source of wonder to them all. They investigated\nthe laboratory and then went up to the second floor. Morey and Fuller\ngreeted them at the door, and each of the four Earthmen took a group\naround the ship, explaining as they went.\n\nThe library was a point of great interest, exceeded only by the control\nroom. Arcot found some difficulty in taking care of all his visitors;\nthere were only four chairs in the control room. The Three could sit\ndown, but Arcot needed the fourth chair to pilot the ship. The rest of\nthe party had to hold on as best they could, which was not too difficult\nfor men of such physical strength; they were accustomed to high\naccelerations in their elevators.\n\nMorey, Wade, and Fuller strapped themselves into the seats at the ray\nprojectors at the sides and stern.\n\nArcot wanted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the ship's armament\nfirst, and then the maneuverability. He picked a barren hillside for the\nfirst demonstration. It was a great rocky cliff, high above the timber\nline, towering almost vertically a thousand feet above them.\n\nWade triggered his molecular projector, and a pale beam reached out\ntoward the cliff. Instantly, the cliff leaped ten miles into the air,\nwhining and roaring as it shot up through the atmosphere. Then it\nstarted to fall. Heated by its motion through the air, it struck the\nmountaintop as a mass of red hot rock which shattered into fragments\nwith a terrific roar! The rocks rolled and bounced down the\nmountainside, their path traced by a line of steam clouds.\n\nThen, at Arcot's order, the heat beams were all turned on the mountain\nat full power. In less than a minute, the peak began to melt, sending\nstreamers of lava down the sides. The beams began to eat out a crater in\nthe center, where the rock began to boil furiously under the terrific\nenergy of the heat beams.\n\nThen Arcot shut off the heat beams and turned on the molecular ray.\n\nThe molecules of the molten rock were traveling at high velocities--the\nheat was terrific. Arcot could see that the rock was boiling quite\nfreely. When the molecular beam hit it, every one of those fast moving\nmolecules shot upward together! With the roar of a meteor, it plunged\ntoward space at five miles a second!\n\nIt had dropped to absolute zero when the beam hit it, but at that speed\nthrough the air, it didn't stay cold long! Arcot followed it up in the\n_Ancient Mariner_. It was going too slowly for him. The air had slowed\nit down and heated it up, so Arcot hit it with the molecular ray again,\nconverting the heat back into velocity.\n\nBy the time they reached free space, Arcot had maneuvered the lump of\nrock into an orbit around the planet.\n\n\"Tharlano,\" he thought at the Astronomer, \"your planet now has a new\nsatellite!\"\n\n\"So I perceive!\" replied Tharlano. \"Now that we are in space, can we use\nthe instrument you told me of?\"\n\nArcot established the ship in an orbit twenty thousand miles from the\nplanet and led them back to the observatory, where Morey had already\ntrained the telectroscope on the planet below. There wasn't much to see;\nthe amplification showed only the rushing ground moving by so fast that\nthe image blurred.\n\nHe turned it to Sator. It filled the screen as they increased the power,\nbut all they could see was billowing clouds. Another poor subject.\n\nMorey showed Tharlano, the Astronomer, how to use the controls, and he\nbegan to sweep the sky with the instrument, greatly pleased with its\nresolving ability and tremendous magnification.\n\nThe Military Leader of the Three pointed out that the Satorians still\nhad a weapon that was reported deadly, and they were in imminent danger\nunless Arcot's inventions were applied at once. All the way back to\nNansal, they spent the time discussing the problem in the _Ancient\nMariner_'s Library.\n\nIt was finally agreed that the necessary plans and blueprints were to be\ngiven to the Nansalians, who could start production at once. The biggest\nproblem was in the supply of lux and relux, which, because of their vast\nenergy-content, required the atomic converters of the _Ancient Mariner_\nto make them. The Earthmen agreed to supply the power and the necessary\nmaterials to begin operations.\n\nWhen the ship landed, a meeting of the manufacturers was called. Fuller\ndistributed prints of the microfilmed plans for the equipment that he\nhad packed in the library, and the factory engineers worked from them to\nbuild the necessary equipment.\n\nThe days that followed were busy days for Earthmen and Nansalians alike.\n\nThe Nansalians were fearful of the consequences of the weapon that the\nSatorians were rumored to have. The results of their investigations\nthrough their agents had, so far, resulted only in the death of the\nsecret service men. All that was known was exactly what the Satorians\nwanted them to know; the instrument was new, and it was deadly.\n\nOn the other hand, the Satorians were not entirely in the dark as to the\nprogress of Nansal, as Arcot and Morey discovered one day.\n\nAfter months of work designing and tooling up the Nansalian factories,\nmaking the tools to make the tools to make the war material needed, and\ntraining the engineers of Nansal all over the planet to produce the\nequipment needed, Arcot and Morey finally found time to take a few days\noff.\n\nTharlano had begun a systematic search of the known nebulae, comparing\nthem with the photographs the Earthmen had given him, and looking for a\ngalaxy with two satellite star clouds of exactly the right size and\ndistance from the great spiral.\n\nAfter months of work, he had finally picked one which filled the bill\nexactly! He invited Arcot and Morey to the observatory to confirm his\nfindings.\n\nThe observatory was located on the barren peak of a great mountain more\nthan nine miles high. It was almost the perfect place for an\nastronomical telescope. Here, well above the troposphere, the air was\nthin and always clear. The solid rock of the mountain was far from\ndisturbing influences which might cause any vibration in the telescope.\n\nThe observatory was accessible only from a spaceship or air flyer, and,\nat that altitude, had to be pressurized and sealed against the thin,\ncold air outside. Within, the temperature was kept constant to a\nfraction of a degree to keep thermal expansion from throwing the mirror\nout of true.\n\nArcot and Morey, accompanied by Tharlano and Torlos, settled the\n_Ancient Mariner_ to the landing field that had been blasted out of the\nrock of the towering mountain. They went over to the observatory and\nwere at once admitted to the airlock.\n\nThe floor was of smoothed, solid rock, and in this, the great clock\nwhich timed and moved the telescope was set.\n\nThe entire observatory was, of course, surrounded by a magnetic shield,\nand it was necessary to make sure there were no enemy ships around\nbefore using the telescope, because the magnetic field affected the\nlight rays passing through it.\n\nThe mirror for the huge reflecting telescope was nearly three hundred\ninches in diameter, and was powerful enough to spot a spaceship leaving\nSator. Its military usefulness, however, was practically nil, since\npainting the ships black made them totally invisible.\n\nThere were half a dozen assistants with Tharlano at the observatory at\nall times, one of them in charge of the great file of plates that were\nkept on hand. Every plate made was printed in triplicate, to prevent\ntheir being destroyed in a raid. The original was kept at the\nobservatory, and copies were sent to two of the largest cities on\nNansal. It was from this file that Tharlano had gathered the data\nnecessary to show Arcot his own galaxy.\n\nTharlano was proudly explaining the telescope to Arcot, realizing that\nthe telectroscope was far better, but knowing that the Earthmen would\nappreciate this triumph of mechanical perfection. Arcot and Morey were\nboth intensely interested in the discussion, while Torlos, slightly\nbored by a subject he knew next to nothing about, was examining the rest\nof the observatory.\n\nSuddenly, he cried out in warning, and leaped a full thirty feet over\nthe rock floor to gather Arcot and Morey in his great arms. There was a\nsharp, distinct snap of a pneumatic pistol, and the thud of a bullet.\nArcot and Morey each felt Torlos jerk!\n\nQuick as a flash, Torlos pushed the two men behind the great tube of the\ntelescope. He leaped over it and across the room, and disappeared into\nthe supply room. There was the noise of a scuffle, another crack from a\npneumatic pistol, and the sudden crash and tinkle of broken glass.\n\nSuddenly, the figure of a man described a wide arc as it flew out of the\nsupply room and landed with a heavy crash on the floor. Instantly,\nTorlos leaped at him. There was a trickle of blood from his left\nshoulder, but he gripped the man in his giant arms, pinning him to the\nfloor. The struggle was brief. Torlos simply squeezed the man's chest in\nhis arms. There was the faint creak of metal, and the man's chest began\nto bend! In a moment, he was unconscious.\n\nTorlos pulled a heavy leather belt off of the unconscious man and tied\nhis arms with it, wrapping it many times around the wrists, and was\npicking the man up when Tharlano arrived, followed by Arcot and Morey.\nTorlos smiled broadly.\n\n\"This is one Satorian spy that won't report. I could have finished him\nwhen I got my hold on him, but I wanted to take him before the Council\nfor questioning. He'll be all right; I just dented his chest a little.\"\n\n\"We owe our lives to you again, Torlos,\" Arcot told him gravely. \"But\nyou certainly risked your life; the bullet might well have penetrated\nyour heart instead of striking a rib, as it seems to have done.\"\n\n\"Rib? What is a rib?\" The thought concept seemed totally unfamiliar to\nTorlos.\n\nArcot looked at him oddly, then reached out and ran an exploratory hand\nover Torlos' chest. It was smooth and solid!\n\n\"Morey!\" Arcot exclaimed. \"These men have no ribs! Their chest is as\nsolid as their skulls!\"\n\n\"Then how do they breathe?\" Morey asked.\n\n\"How do you breathe? I mean most of the time. You use your diaphragm and\nyour abdominal muscles. These people do, too!\"\n\nMorey grinned. \"No wonder Torlos jumped in front of that bullet! He\ndidn't have as much to fear as we do--he had a built-in bullet proof\nvest! You'd have to shoot him in the abdomen to reach any vital organ.\"\n\nArcot turned back to Torlos. \"Who is this man?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly a Satorian spy sent to murder you Earthmen. I saw the\nmuzzle of his pistol as he was aiming and jumped in the way of the\nbullet. There is not much damage done.\"\n\n\"We'd better get back to the city,\" Arcot said. \"Fuller and Wade might\nbe in danger!\"\n\nThey bundled the Satorian spy into the ship, where Morey tied him\nfurther with thin strands of lux cable no bigger than a piece of string.\n\nTorlos looked at it and shook his head. \"He will break that as soon as\nhe awakens, without even knowing it. You forget the strength of our\npeople.\" Morey smiled and wrapped the cord around Torlos' wrists.\n\nTorlos looked amused and pulled. His smile vanished. He pulled harder.\nHis huge muscles bulged and writhed in great ridges along his arms. The\nthin cord remained complacently undamaged. Torlos relaxed and grinned\nsheepishly.\n\n\"You win,\" he thought. \"I'll make no more comments on the things I see\nyou do.\"\n\nThey returned to the capital at once. Arcot shoved the speed up as high\nas he dared, for Torlos felt there might be some significance in the\nattempt to remove Arcot and Morey. Wade and Fuller had already been\nwarned by radio, and had immediately retired to the Council Room of the\nThree. The members of the Investigation Board joined them to question\nthe prisoner upon his arrival.\n\nWhen they arrived, Arcot and Morey went in with Torlos, who was carrying\nthe struggling, shackled spy over his shoulder.\n\nThe Earthmen watched while the expert interrogators of the Investigation\nBoard questioned the prisoner. The philosophy of Norus did not permit\ntorture, even for a vicious enemy, but the questioners were shrewd and\ningenious in their methods. For hours, they took turns pounding\nquestions at the prisoner, cajoling, threatening, and arguing.\n\nThey got nowhere. Solidly, the prisoner stuck by his guns. Why had he\ntried to shoot the Earthmen? He didn't know. What were his orders from\nSator? Silence. What were Sator's plans? Silence. Did he know anything\nof the new weapon? A shrug of the shoulders.\n\nFinally, Arcot spoke to the Chief Investigation Officer. \"May I try my\nluck? I think I'm powerful enough to use a little combination of\nhypnosis and telepathy that will get the information out of him.\" The\nInvestigator agreed to try it.\n\nArcot walked over as if to inspect the prisoner. For an instant, the man\nlooked defiantly at Arcot. Arcot glared back. At the same time, his\npowerful mind reached out and began to work subtly within the prisoner's\nbrain. Slowly, a helpless, blank expression came over the man's face\nas his eyes remained fixed on Arcot's own. The man was as helplessly\nbound mentally as the lux cable bound him physically.\n\nFor a full quarter of an hour, the two men, Earthmen and Satorian, stood\nlocked in a frozen tableau, staring into each other's eyes. The\nonlookers waited in watchful silence.\n\nFinally, Arcot turned and shook his head, as if to clear it. As he did\nso, the spy slumped forward in his chair, unconscious.\n\nArcot rubbed his own temples and spoke in English to Morey. \"Some job!\nYou'll have to tell them what I found out; my head is splitting! With a\nheadache like this, I can't communicate.\n\n\"Torlos was right; they were trying to get rid of all four of us. We're\nthe only ones who can operate the ship, and that ship is the only\ndefense against them.\n\n\"He knows several other spies here in the city, and we can, I think,\npractically wipe out the Satorian spy system all over the planet with\nthe information he gave me and what we can get from others we arrest.\n\n\"Unfortunately, he doesn't know anything about the new weapon; the\nhigher-ups aren't telling anyone, not even their own men. I get the idea\nthat only those on board the ships using it will know about it before\nthe attack.\n\n\"An attack is planned, and very soon. He didn't know when. We can only\nlie in readiness and do everything we can to help these people with\ntheir work.\"\n\nWhile Morey relayed this information to the Investigating Board and the\nCouncil, Wade was talking in low tones to Arcot.\n\n\"They had a lot of workmen bring twenty tons of lead wire on board this\nevening, and the distilled water tanks are full. The tanks are full of\noxygen, and they gave us some synthetic food which we can eat.\n\n\"They have it all over us in the field of chemistry. They've found the\nsecret of catalysis, and can actually synthesize any catalytic agent\nthey want. They can make any possible reaction go in either direction\nat any rate they desire.\n\n\"They took a slice of flesh from my arm and analyzed it down to the last\ndetail. From that, they were able to predict what sort of food we would\nneed to eat. They can actually synthesize living things!\n\n\"I've tried the food they made, and it has a very good flavor. They\nguaranteed it would have all the necessary ingredients, right down to\nthe smallest trace element!\n\n\"We're fully stocked for a long trip. The Three said it was their first\nconsideration that we should be able to return to our homes.\"\n\n\"How about their armament?\" Arcot asked. He was holding his head in his\nhands to ease the throbbing ache within it.\n\n\"Each city has a projector supplied by the regular power station on top\nof their central building. The molecular ray, of course; they still\ndon't have enough power to run a heat beam.\n\n\"We didn't have time to make more than one for each city, but this one\nwill give the Satorians a nasty time if they come near it. It works\nnicely through the magnetic screen, so it won't be necessary for them to\nlower the barrier to shoot.\"\n\nMorey had finished telling the Council what Arcot had discovered from\nthe prisoner, and the Councilmen were leaving one by one to go to their\nduties in preparing for the attack.\n\n\"I think we had best go back to the _Ancient Mariner_,\" Arcot said. \"I\nneed an aspirin and some sleep.\"\n\n\"Same here,\" agreed Fuller. \"These men make me feel as though I were\nlazy. They work for forty or fifty hours and think nothing of it. Then\nthey snooze for five hours and they're ready for another long stretch. I\nfeel like a lounge lizard if I take six hours out of every twenty-four.\"\n\nThey asked Torlos to stand guard on the ship while they got some much\nneeded sleep, and Torlos consented readily after getting the permission\nof the Supreme Three. The Earthmen were returned to their ship under\nheavy guard to prevent further attempts at assassination.\n\nIt was seven hours after they had gone to sleep that it came.\n\nThrough the ship came the low hum that rose quickly to a screeching call\nof danger--the warning! The city was under attack!\n\n\n\n\nXXII\n\n\nThe Nansalian fleet was already outside the city and hard at it. The\nfight was on! But Arcot saw that the fight was one-sided in the extreme.\nShip after ship of the Nansalian fleet seemed to burst into sudden,\ninexplicable flame and fall blazing against another of their own ships!\nIt seemed as though some irresistible attraction drew the ships together\nand smashed them against each other in a blaze of electric flame, while\nthe ships of Sator did nothing but stay far off to one side and dodge\nthe rays of the Nansalian ships.\n\nQuickly, Arcot turned to Torlos. \"Torlos, go out! Leave the ship! We can\nwork better when you aren't here, since we don't have to worry about\nexposure to magnetic rays. I don't like to make you miss this, but it's\nfor your world!\"\n\nTorlos showed his disappointment; he wanted to be in this battle. But he\nrealized that what the Earthman said was true. Their weak, stone bones\nwere completely immune to the effects of even the most powerful magnetic\nray.\n\nHe nodded. \"I'll go. Good Luck! And give them a few shots for me!\"\n\nHe turned and ran down the corridor to the airlock. As soon as he was\noutside, Arcot lifted the ship.\n\nIt had taken less than a minute to get into the air, but in that\nminute, the Nansalian fleet had taken a terrific beating. Arcot noticed\nthat the few ships of Sator that had been hit smashed into the ground\nwith a terrible blaze of violet light that left nothing but a pile of\nfused metal.\n\n\"They've got something, all right,\" Arcot thought to himself as he drove\nthe _Ancient Mariner_ into battle.\n\nIt would be impossible for the Nansalians to lower their magnetic\nscreen, even for a second, so Arcot simply aimed the ship toward it and\nturned on the power.\n\n\"Hold on!\" he called as they struck it. The ship reeled and sank\nsuddenly planetward, then it bounced up and outward. They were through\nthe wall.\n\nThe rooms were suddenly oppressively hot, and the molecular cooler was\nstruggling to lower it. \"We made it,\" Morey said triumphantly, \"but the\neddy currents sure heated up the hull!\"\n\nThey were out of the city now, speeding toward the battle. Following a\nprearranged system, the Nansalian ships retreated, leaving the Earthmen\na free hand. They needed no help!\n\nWade, Fuller, and Morey began to lash out with the molecular beams,\nsmashing the Satorian ships in on themselves, crushing them to the\nground, where they exploded in violet flame.\n\nWade and Fuller began to work together. Wade caught one ship in the\nmolecular ray, and Fuller hit with a heat beam. Like some titanic broom\nthey swept it around at dozens of miles a second, leaping, twisting,\nsmashing ship after ship. Like a snowball, the lump of glowing metal\ngrew with each crash, till a dozen ships had fallen into it. It was a\nnew broom, and it swept clean!\n\nThen a magnetic beam caught the _Ancient Mariner_. With a shock, it\nslowed down at a terrific rate. Then Arcot turned on more power, and\nsimply dragged the other ship along by its own magnetic beam! Wade tore\nthe ship loose with his molecular beam, but the mighty mass of metal\nthat had been his broom was gone, a glowing mass of metal on the ground.\n\n\"We haven't seen that new weapon yet,\" Morey called.\n\n\"Can't find us!\" Arcot replied into the intercom. The sun was setting,\nand the blazing red star was lighting the ship, making it seem like a\nball of fire when still and a flashing streak of red light when in\nmotion.\n\nShip after ship of the Satorians was going down before the three beams\nof the Earth ship; the great fleet was dissolving like a lump of sugar\nin boiling water.\n\nSuddenly, just ahead of them, an enemy ship drove toward them with\nobvious intent to ram; if his magnetic beam caught them, and drew them\ntowards him, there would be a head-on collision.\n\nWade caught it with a molecular beam, and it became a blazing wreck on\nthe ground.\n\n\"All rays off!\" Arcot called. As soon as they were off, Arcot hit a\nswitch, and the _Ancient Mariner_ vanished.\n\nArcot drove the invisible ship high above the battle. Below, the\nSatorians were searching wildly for the ship. They knew it must be\nsomewhere near, and feared that at any second it might materialize\nbefore them with its deadly rays.\n\nArcot stayed above them for nearly a minute while the ships below\ntwisted and turned, wildly seeking him. Then they went into formation\nagain and started back for the city.\n\n\"That's what I wanted!\" Arcot said grimly. \"In formation, they're like\nsitting ducks!\" He dropped the ship like a plummet while the ray\noperators prepared to sweep the formation with their beams.\n\nSuddenly the _Ancient Mariner_ was visible again. Simultaneously, three\nrays leaped down and bathed the formation in their pale radiance. The\nfront ranks vanished, and the line broke, attacking the ship that hung\nabove them now. Four magnetic beams hit the _Ancient Mariner_ at once!\nArcot couldn't pull away from all four, and his gunners couldn't tell\nwhich ships were holding them.\n\nAll at once, the men felt a violent electrical shock! The air about them\nwas filled with the blue haze of the electric weapon they had seen!\n\nInstantly, the magnetic beams left them, and they saw behind them a\nsingle Satorian ship heading toward them, surrounded by that same bluish\nhalo of light. A suicide ship!\n\nArcot accelerated away from it as Fuller hit it with a molecular beam.\nThe ship reeled and stopped, and the _Ancient Mariner_ pulled away from\nit rapidly. Then, the frost-covered ship of the dead came on, still\nheading for them!\n\nArcot turned and went off to the right, but like a pursuing Nemesis, the\nstrange ship came after them in the shortest, most direct route!\n\nThe molecular beams were useless now; there was no molecular energy left\nin the frozen hulk that accelerated toward them. Suddenly, the two\nenvelopes of blue light touched and coalesced! A great, blinding arc\nleaped between the two ships as the speeding Satorian hull smashed\nviolently against the side of the _Ancient Mariner_! The men ducked\nautomatically, and were hurled against their seat-straps with tremendous\nforce. There was a rending, crashing roar, a sea of flame--and darkness.\n\nThey could only have been unconscious a few seconds, for when the fog\nwent away, they could see the glowing mass of the enemy ship still\nfalling far beneath them. The lux wall where it had hit was still\nglowing red.\n\n\"Morey!\" Arcot called. \"You all right? Wade? Fuller?\"\n\n\"Okay!\" Morey answered.\n\nSo were Wade and Fuller.\n\n\"It was the lux hull that saved us,\" Arcot said. \"It wouldn't break, and\nthe temperature of the arc didn't bother it. And since it wouldn't carry\na current, we didn't get the full electrical effect.\n\n\"I'm going to convince those birds that this ship is made of something\nthey can't touch! We'll give them a real show!\"\n\nHe dived downward, back into the battle.\n\nIt was a show, all right! It was impossible to fight the Earth ship. The\nenemy had to concentrate four magnetic rays on it to use their electric\nweapon, and they could only do that by sheer luck!\n\nAnd even that was of little use, for they simply lost one of their own\nships without harming the _Ancient Mariner_ in the least.\n\nShip after ship crumpled in on itself like crushed tinfoil or hurled\nitself violently to the ground as the molecular beams touched them. The\nSatorian fleet was a fleet no longer; it was a small collection of\ndisorganized ships whose commanders had only one thought--to flee!\n\nThe few ships that were left spearheaded out into space, using every bit\nof acceleration that the tough bodies of the Satorians could stand. With\na good head start, they were rapidly escaping.\n\n\"We can't equal that acceleration,\" said Wade. \"We'll lose them!\"\n\n\"Nope!\" Arcot said grimly. \"I want a couple of those ships, and I'm\ngoing to get them!\"\n\nAt four gravities of acceleration, the _Ancient Mariner_ drove after the\nfleeing ships of Sator, but the enemy ships soon dropped rapidly from\nsight.\n\nTwenty five thousand miles out in space, Arcot cut the acceleration.\n\"We'll catch them now, I think,\" he said softly. He pushed the little\nred switch for an instant, then opened it. A moment before, the planet\nNansal had been a huge disc behind them. Now it was a tiny thing, a full\nmillion miles away.\n\nIt took the Satorian fleet over an hour to reach them. They appeared as\ndim lights in the telectroscope. They rapidly became larger. Arcot had\nextinguished the lights, and since they were on the sunward side of the\napproaching ships, the _Ancient Mariner_ was effectively invisible.\n\n\"They're going to pass us at a pretty good clip,\" Morey said quietly.\n\"They've been accelerating all this time.\"\n\nArcot nodded in agreement. \"We'll have to hit them as they come toward\nus. We'd never get one in passing.\"\n\nAs the ships grew rapidly in the plate, Arcot gave the order to fire!\n\nThe molecular rays slashed out toward the onrushing ships, picking them\noff as fast as the beams could be directed. The rays were invisible in\nspace, so they managed to get several before the Satorians realized what\nwas happening.\n\nThen, in panic, they scattered all over space, fleeing madly from the\nimpossible ship that was firing on them. They knew they had left it\nbehind, yet here it was, waiting for them!\n\n\"Let them go,\" Arcot said. \"We've got our specimens, and the rest can\ncarry the word back to Sator that the war is over for them.\"\n\nIt was several hours later that the _Ancient Mariner_ approached Nansal\nagain, bringing with it two Satorian ships. By careful use of the heat\nbeam and the molecular beam, the Earthmen had managed to jockey the two\nbattle cruisers back to Nansal.\n\nIt was nighttime when they landed. The whole area around the city was\nilluminated by giant searchlights. Men were working recovering the\nbodies of the dead, aiding those who had survived, and examining the\nwreckage.\n\nArcot settled the two Satorian ships to the ground, and landed the\n_Ancient Mariner_.\n\nTorlos sprinted over the ground toward them as he saw the great silver\nship land. He had been helping in the examination of the wrecked enemy\nships.\n\n\"Have they attacked anywhere else on the planet?\" Arcot asked as he\nopened the airlock.\n\nTorlos nodded. \"They hit five other cities, but they didn't use as big a\nfleet as they did here. The plan of battle seems to have been for the\nships with the new weapons to hit here first and then hit each of the\nother cities in turn. They didn't have enough to make a full-scale\nattack; evidently, your presence here made them desperate.\n\n\"At any rate, the other cities were able to beat off the magnetic beam\nships with the projectors of molecular beams.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Arcot thought. \"Then the Nansal-Sator war is practically over!\"\n\n\n\n\nXXIII\n\n\nRichard Arcot stepped into the open airlock of the _Ancient Mariner_ and\nwalked down the corridor to the library. There, he found Fuller and Wade\nbattling silently over a game of chess and Morey relaxed in a chair with\na book in his hands.\n\n\"What a bunch of loafers,\" Arcot said acidly. \"Don't you ever _do_\nanything?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Fuller. \"The three of us have entered into a lifelong pact\nwith each other to refrain from using a certain weapon which would make\nthis war impossible for all time.\"\n\n\"What war?\" Arcot wondered. \"And what weapon?\"\n\n\"This war,\" Wade grinned, pointing at the chess board. \"We have agreed\nabsolutely never to read each other's minds while playing chess.\"\n\nMorey lowered his book and looked at Arcot. \"And just what have you been\nso busy about?\"\n\n\"I've been investigating the weapon on board the Satorian ships we\ncaptured,\" Arcot told them. \"Quite an interesting effect. The Nansalian\nscientists and I have been analyzing the equipment for the past three\ndays.\n\n\"The Satorians found a way to cut off and direct an electrostatic field.\nThe energy required was tremendous, but they evidently separated the\ncharges on Sator and carried them along on the ships.\n\n\"You can see what would happen if a ship were charged negatively and the\nship next to it were charged positively! The magnitude of electrostatic\nforces is terrific! If you put two ounces of iron ions, with a positive\ncharge, on the north pole, and an equivalent amount of chlorine ions,\nnegatively charged, on the south pole, the attraction, even across that\ndistance, would be three hundred and sixty tons!\n\n\"They located the negative charges on one ship and the positive charges\non the one next to it. Their mutual attraction pulled them toward each\nother. As they got closer, the charges arced across, heating and fusing\nthe two ships. But they still had enough motion toward each other to\ncrash.\n\n\"They were wrecked by less than a tenth of an ounce of ions which were\nprojected to the ship and held there by an automatic field until the\nships got close enough to arc through it.\n\n\"We still haven't been able to analyze that trick field, though.\"\n\n\"Well, now that we've gotten things straightened out,\" Fuller said,\n\"let's go home! I'm anxious to leave! We're all ready to go, aren't we?\"\n\nArcot nodded. \"All except for one thing. The Supreme Three want to see\nus. We've got a meeting with them in an hour, so put on your best Sunday\npants.\"\n\nIn the Council of Three, Arcot was officially invited to remain with\nthem. The fleet of molecular motion ships was nearing completion--the\nfirst one was to roll off the assembly line the next day--but they\nwanted Arcot, Wade, Morey, and Fuller to remain on Nansal.\n\n\"We have a large world here,\" the Scientist thought at them. \"Thanks to\nyou people, we can at last call it our own. We offer you, in the name of\nthe people, your choice of any spot in this world. And we give\nyou--this!\" The Scientist came forward. He had a disc-shaped plaque,\nperhaps three inches in diameter, made of a deep ruby-red metal. In the\nexact center was a green stone which seemed to shine of its own accord,\nwith a pale, clear, green light; it was transparent and highly\nrefractive. Around it, at the three points of a triangle, were three\nsimilar, but smaller stones. Engraved lines ran from each of the stones\nto the center, and other lines connected the outer three in a triangle.\nThe effect was as though one were looking down at the apex of a regular\ntetrahedron.\n\nThere were characters in Nansalese at each point of the tetrahedron, and\nother characters engraved in a circle around it.\n\nArcot turned it in his hand. On the back was a representation of the\nNansalian planetary system. The center was a pale yellow, highly-faceted\nstone which represented the sun. Around this were the orbits of planets,\nand each of the eleven planets was marked by a different colored stone.\n\nThe Scientist was holding in the palm of his hand another such disc,\nslightly smaller. On it, there were three green stones, one slightly\nlarger than the others.\n\n\"This is my badge of office as Scientist of the Three. The stone marked\nScience is here larger. Your plaque is new. Henceforth, it shall be the\nThree and a Coordinator!\n\n\"Your vote shall outweigh all but a unanimous vote of the Three. To you,\nthis world is answerable, for you have saved our civilization. And when\nyou return, as you have promised, you shall be Coordinator of this\nsystem!\"\n\nArcot stood silent for a moment. This was a thing he had never thought\nof. He was a scientist, and he knew that his ability was limited to that\nfield.\n\nAt last, he smiled and replied: \"It is a great honor, and it is a great\nwork. But I can not spend my time here always; I must return to my own\nplanet. I can not be fairly in contact with you.\n\n\"Therefore, I will make my first move in office now, and suggest that\nthis plaque signify, not the Coordinator, and first power of your\ncountry, but Counselor and first friend in all things in which I can\nserve you.\n\n\"The tetrahedron you have chosen; so let it be. The apex is out of the\nplane of the other points, and I am out of this galaxy. But there is a\nrelationship between the apex and the points of the base, and these\nlines will exist forever.\n\n\"We have been too busy to think of anything else as yet, but our worlds\nare large, and your worlds are large. Commerce can develop across the\nten million light years of space as readily as it now exists across the\nlittle space of our own system. It is a journey of but five days, and\nlater machines will make it in less! Commerce will come, and with it\nwill come close communication.\n\n\"I will accept this plaque with the understanding that I am but your\nfriend and advisor. Too much power in the hands of one man is bad. Even\nthough you trust me completely, there might be an unscrupulous\nsuccessor.\n\n\"And I must return to my world.\n\n\"Your first ship will be ready tomorrow, and when it is completed, my\nfriends and I will leave your planet.\n\n\"We will return, though. We are ten million light years apart, but the\nuniverse is not to be measured in space anymore, but in time. We are\nfive days apart. I will be nearer to you at all times than is Sator!\n\n\"If you wish, others of my race shall come, too. But if you do not want\nthem to come, they will not. I alone have Tharlano's photographs of the\nroute, and I can lose them.\"\n\nFor a moment, the Three spoke together, then the Scientist was again\nthinking at Arcot.\n\n\"Perhaps you are right. It is obvious your people know more than we.\nThey have the molecular ray, and they know no wars; they do not destroy\neach other. They must be a good race, and we have seen excellent\nexamples in you.\n\n\"We can realize your desire to return home, but we ask you to come\nagain. We will remember that you are not ten million light years, but\nfive days, from our planet.\"\n\nWhen the conference was ended, Arcot and his friends returned to their\nship. Torlos was waiting for them outside the airlock.\n\n\"Abaout haow saon you laive?\" he asked in English.\n\n\"Why--tomorrow,\" Arcot said, in surprise. \"Have you been practicing our\nlanguage?\"\n\nTorlos reverted to telepathy. \"Yes, but that is not what I came to talk\nto you about. Arcot--can a man of Nansal visit Earth?\" Anxiously,\nhopefully, and hesitatingly, he asked. \"I could come back on one of your\ncommercial vessels, or come back when you return. And--and I'm sure I\ncould earn my living on your world! I'm not hard to feed, you know!\" He\nhalf smiled, but he was too much in earnest to make a perfect success.\n\nArcot was amazed that he should ask. It was an idea he would very much\nlike to see fulfilled. The idea of metal-boned men with tremendous\nstrength and strange molecular-motion muscles would inspire no\nfriendship, no feeling of kinship, in the people of Earth. But the man\nhimself--a pleasant, kindly, sincere, intelligent giant--would be a far\ngreater argument for the world of Nansal that the most vivid orator\nwould ever be.\n\nArcot asked the others, and the vote was unanimous--let him come!\n\nThe next day, amid great ceremony, the first of the new Nansalian ships\ncame from the factories. When the celebration was over, the four\nEarthmen and the giant Torlos entered the _Ancient Mariner_.\n\n\"Ready to go, Torlos?\" Arcot grinned.\n\n\"Pearfactly, Ahcut. Tse soonah tse bettah!\" he said in his oddly\naccented English.\n\nFive hours saw them out of the galaxy. Twelve hours more, and they were\nheading for home at full speed, well out in space.\n\nThe Home Galaxy was looming large when they next stopped for\nobservation. Old Tharlano had guided them correctly!\n\nThey were going home!\n\n\n\n\nCLASSICS OF GREAT SCIENCE-FICTION\nfrom ACE BOOKS\n\nG-547 (50 cents) THE BLIND SPOT\nby Austin Hall and H. E.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
