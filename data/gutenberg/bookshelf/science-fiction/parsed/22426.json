COLE\n\n\n  _A Playboy is someone with power, too much time\n   on his hands, and too little sense of a goal\n   worth achieving. And if the Playboy happens to\n   belong to a highly advanced culture...._\n\n\n Illustrated by Solo\n\n\nThrough the narrow streets leading to the great plaza of Karth, swarmed\na colorful crowd--buyers, idlers, herdsmen, artisans, traders. From all\ndirections they came, some to gather around the fountain, some to\nexplore the wineshops, many to examine the wares, or to buy from the\nmerchants whose booths and tents hid the cobblestones.\n\nA caravan wound its way through a gate and stopped, the weary beasts\nstanding patiently as the traders sought vacant space where they might\nopen business. From another gate, a herdsman guided his living wares\nthrough the crowd, his working animals snapping at the heels of the\nflock, keeping it together and in motion.\n\nMusa, trader of Karth, sat cross-legged before his shop, watching the\nscene with quiet amusement. Business was good in the city, and his was\npleasingly above the average. Western caravans had come in, exchanging\ntheir goods for those eastern wares he had acquired. Buyers from the\ncity and from the surrounding hills had come to him, to exchange their\ncoin for his goods. He glanced back into the booth, satisfied with what\nhe saw, then resumed his casual watch of the plaza. No one seemed\ninterested in him.\n\nThere were customers in plenty. Men stopped, critically examined the\ncontents of the displays, then moved on, or stayed to bargain. One of\nthese paused before Musa, his eyes dwelling on the merchant rather than\non his wares.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe shopper was a man of medium height. His rather slender, finely\nfeatured face belied the apparent heaviness of his body, though his\nappearance was not actually abnormal. Rather, he gave the impression of\nbeing a man of powerful physique and ascetic habits. His dress was that\nof a herdsman, or possibly of an owner of herds from the northern\nGalankar.\n\nMusa arose, to face him.\n\n\"Some sleeping rugs, perhaps? Or a finely worked bronze jar from the\nEast?\"\n\nThe stranger nodded. \"Possibly. But I would like to look a while if I\nmay.\"\n\nMusa stepped aside, waving a hand. \"You are more than welcome, friend,\"\nhe assented. \"Perhaps some of my poor goods may strike your fancy.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\" The stranger moved inside.\n\nMusa stood at the entrance, watching him. As the man stepped from place\nto place, Musa noted that he seemed to radiate a certain confidence.\nThere was a definite aura of power and ability. This man, the trader\ndecided, was no ordinary herdsman. He commanded more than sheep.\n\n\"You own herds to the North?\" he asked.\n\nThe stranger turned, smiling. \"Lanko is my name,\" he said. \"Yes, I come\nfrom the North.\" He swept a hand to indicate the merchandise on display,\nand directed a questioning gaze at the merchant. \"It seems strange that\nyour goods are all of the East. I see little of the West in all your\nshop.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNormally, Musa kept his own council, assuming that his affairs were not\npublic property, but his alone. There was something about this man,\nLanko, however, which influenced him to break his usual reticence.\n\n\"I plan a trading trip to the Eastern Sea,\" he confided. \"Of course, to\ncarry eastern goods again to the East would be a waste of time, so I am\nreserving my western goods for the caravan and clearing out the things\nof the East.\"\n\nLanko nodded. \"I see.\" He pointed to a small case of finely worked\njewelry. \"What would be the price of those earrings?\"\n\nMusa reached into the case, taking out a cunningly worked pair of shell\nand gold trinkets.\n\n\"These are from Norlar, a type of jewelry we rarely see here,\" he said.\n\"For these, I must ask twenty balata.\"\n\nLanko whistled softly. \"No wonder you would make a trip East. I wager\nthere is profit in those.\" He pointed. \"What of the sword up there?\"\n\nMusa laughed. \"You hesitate at twenty balata, then you point out that?\"\n\nHe crossed the tent, taking the sword from the wall. Drawing it from its\nscabbard, he pointed to the unusually long, slender blade.\n\n\"This comes from Norlar, too. But the smith who made it is still farther\nto the east, beyond the Great Sea.\" He gripped the blade, flexing it.\n\n\"Look you,\" he commanded, \"how this blade has life. Here is none of your\nsoft bronze or rough iron from the northern hills. Here is a living\nmetal that will sever a hair, yet not shatter on the hardest helm.\"\n\nLanko showed interest. \"You say this sword was made beyond the Great\nSea? How, then, came it to Norlar and thence here?\"\n\nMusa shook his head. \"I am not sure,\" he confessed. \"It is rumored that\nthe priests of the sea god, Kondaro, by praying to their deity, are\nguided across the sea to lands unknown.\"\n\n\"Taking traders with them?\"\n\n\"So I have been told.\"\n\n\"And you plan to journey to Norlar to verify this rumor, and perhaps to\nmake a sea voyage?\"\n\nMusa stroked his beard, wondering if this man could actually read\nthoughts.\n\n\"Yes,\" he admitted, \"I had that in mind.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Lanko reached for the sword. As Musa handed it to him, he\nextended it toward the rear of the booth, whipping it in an intricate\nsaber drill. Musa watched, puzzled. An experienced swordsman himself he\nhad thought he knew all of the sword arts. The sword flexed, singing as\nit cut through the air.\n\n\"Merchant, I like this sword. What would its price be?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMusa was disappointed. Here was strange bargaining. People just didn't\nwalk in and announce their desire for definite articles. They feigned\nindifference. They picked over the wares casually, disparagingly. They\nlooked at many items, asking prices. They bargained a little, perhaps,\nto test the merchant. They made comments about robbery, and about the\nthings they had seen in other merchants' booths which were so much\nbetter and so much cheaper.\n\nSlowly, and with the greatest reluctance, did the normal shopper\napproach the object he coveted.\n\nThen, here was this man.\n\n\"_Well_,\" Musa told himself, \"_make the most of it_.\" He shrugged.\n\n\"Nine hundred balata,\" he stated definitely, matching the frank\ndirectness of this unusual shopper, and incidentally doubling his price.\n\nLanko was examining the hilt of the sword. He snapped a fingernail\nagainst its blade. There was a musical _ping_.\n\n\"You must like this bit of metal far better than I,\" he commented\nwithout looking up. \"I only like it two hundred balata worth.\"\n\nMusa felt relief at this return to familiar procedure. He held up his\nhands in a horrified gesture.\n\n\"Two hundred!\" he cried. \"Why, that is for the craftsman's apprentices.\nThere is yet the master smith, and those who bring the weapon to you.\nNo, friend, if you want this prince of swords, you must expect to pay\nfor it. One does not--\" He paused. Lanko was sheathing the weapon, his\nwhole bearing expressing unwilling relinquishment.\n\nMusa slowed his speech. \"Still,\" he said softly, \"I am closing out my\neastern stock, after all. Suppose we make it eight hundred fifty?\"\n\n\"Did you say two hundred fifty?\" Lanko held the sheathed sword up,\nturning to the light to inspect the leather work.\n\nThe bargaining went on. Outside, the crowds in the street thinned, as\nthe populace started for their evening meals. The sword was inspected\nand re-inspected. It slid out of its sheath and back again. Finally,\nMusa sighed.\n\n\"Well, all right. Make it five hundred, and I'll go to dinner with you.\"\nHe shook his head in a nearly perfect imitation of despair. \"May the\nwineshop do better than I did.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Housewife, this is Watchdog. Over.\"\n\nThe man at the workbench looked around. Then, he laid his tools aside,\nand picked up a small microphone.\n\n\"This is Housewife,\" he announced.\n\n\"Coming in.\"\n\nThe worker clipped the microphone to his jacket, and crossed the room to\na small panel. He threw a switch, looked briefly at a viewscreen, then\nsnapped another switch.\n\n\"Screen's down,\" he reported. \"Come on in, Lanko.\"\n\nAn opening appeared in the wall, to show a fleeting view of a bleak\nlandscape. Bare rocks jutted from the ice, kept clear of snow by the\nshrieking wind. Extreme cold crept into the room, then a man swept in\nand the wall resumed its solidity behind him.\n\nHe stood for an instant, glancing around, then shrugged off a light robe\nand started shedding equipment.\n\n\"Hi, Pal,\" he was greeted. \"How are things down Karth way?\"\n\n\"Nothing exceptional.\" Lanko shrugged. \"This area's getting so peaceful\nit's monotonous.\" He unsnapped his accumulator and crossed to the power\ngenerator.\n\n\"No wars, or rumors of wars,\" he continued. \"The town's getting\nmoral--very moral, and it's developing into a major center of commerce\nin the process.\" He kicked off his sandals, wriggled out of the baggy\nnative trousers, and tossed his shirt on top of them.\n\n\"No more shakedowns. Tax system's working the way it was originally\nintended to, and the merchants are flocking in.\"\n\nHe walked toward the wall, flicking a hand out. An opening appeared, and\nhe ducked through it.\n\n\"Be with you in a minute, Banasel,\" he called over his shoulder. \"Like\nto get cleaned up.\"\n\nBanasel nodded and went back to the workbench. He picked up a small\npart, examined it, touched it gently a few times with a soft brush, and\nreplaced it in the device he was working on.\n\nHe tightened it into place, and was checking another component when a\nslight shuffle announced his companion's return.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Lanko. \"Met your old pal, Musa. He's doing right well\nfor himself.\"\n\nBanasel swung around. \"Haven't seen him since we joined the Corps.\nWhat's he doing?\"\n\n\"Trading.\" Lanko opened a locker, glancing critically at the clothing\nwithin. \"He set up shop with the load of goods we gave him long ago, and\ndid some pretty shrewd merchandising. Now, he's planning a trip over the\nEastern Sea. He hinted at a rumor of a civilization out past Norlar.\"\n\n\"Nothing out there for several thousand kilos,\" growled Banasel, \"except\nfor a few little islands.\" He jerked a thumb toward the workbench. \"I\ncan't show you right now, because the scanner's down for cleaning, but\nthere isn't even an island for the first couple thousand K's. Currents\nare all wrong, too. No one could cross without navigational equipment.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Lanko assured him. \"We haven't checked over that way for a\nlong time, but I still remember. I didn't put it exactly that way, of\ncourse, but I did ask Musa how he planned to get over the Eastern. And,\nI got an answer.\" He paused as he gathered up the garments he had\ndiscarded.\n\n\"It seems there's a new priesthood at Norlar, who've got something,\" he\ncontinued. \"It's all wrapped up in religious symbology, and they don't\nlet any details get out, but they are guiding ships out to sea, and\nthey're bringing them back again, loaded with goods that never\noriginated in the Galankar, or in any place accessible to the\nGalankar.\" He hung up the last article of clothing and turned, a\nsheathed sword in his hand.\n\n\"Musa sold me this,\" he said, extending the hilt toward Banasel. \"I\nnever saw anything like it on this planet. Did you?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBanasel accepted the weapon, drawing it from its scabbard. He examined\nthe handwork on the hilt, then snapped a fingernail against the blade.\nAs he listened to the musical _ping_, the technician looked at the\nweapon with more interest. Gently, he flexed it, watching for signs of\nstrain. Lanko grinned at him.\n\n\"Go ahead,\" he invited, \"get rough with it. That's a sword you're\nholding, Chum, not one of those bronze skull busters.\"\n\nBanasel extended the sword, whipping it violently. The blade bent, then\nstraightened, and bent again, as it slashed through the air.\n\n\"Well,\" he murmured. \"Something new.\"\n\nHe put the sword on the workbench and took an instrument from a cabinet.\nFor a few minutes, he busied himself taking readings and tapping out\ndata on his computer. He sat back, looking at the sword curiously. At\nlast, he glanced at the computer, then put the test instrument he had\nbeen using back in the cabinet, taking another to replace it. After\ntaking more readings, he looked at the computer, then shook his head,\nturning to Lanko.\n\n\"This,\" he said slowly, \"is excellent steel. Of course, it could be an\naccidental alloy, but I wouldn't think anyone on this planet could have\ndeveloped the technology to get it just so.\" He held the sword away from\nhim, looking at it closely. \"Assuming an accidental alloy, an accident\nin getting precisely the right degree of heat before quenching, and\nsomeone who ground and polished with such care as to leave the temper\nundisturbed, while getting this finish--Oh, it's possible, all right.\nBut 'tain't likely. Musa told you this came from overseas?\"\n\n\"To the best of his knowledge. He got it from a trader who claimed to\nhave been on a voyage across the Eastern Sea.\"\n\nBanasel leaned back, clasping his hands behind his head. \"You must have\nhad quite a talk with Musa. Did he remember you?\"\n\nLanko shook his head. \"Don't be foolish,\" he grunted. \"You and I were\nblotted out of his memory, remember? So are quite a few of the things\nthat happened around Atakar, way back when. He's got a complete past, of\ncourse, but we're not part of it.\n\n\"No, he had a booth in the Karth market. I came through, just looking\nthings over, and recognized him. So, I picked an acquaintance. Beat him\ndown to about half the asking price for this sword, still leaving him a\nwhopping profit. He went to dinner with me, still bewailing the rooking\nI'd given him. Told you, he's a trader. We had quite a talk, certainly.\nBut we were strangers.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" Banasel looked off into space. \"Seems funny. You and I were born\non this planet. We were brought up here, and a lot of people once knew\nus. But they've all forgotten, and we don't belong any more. I'm\nbeginning to see what they mean by 'the lonely life of a guardsman.'\"\n\nHe was silent for a time, then looked at his companion.\n\n\"Do you think these priests at Norlar might be in our line of business?\"\n\n\"Could be,\" nodded Lanko. \"There's a lot of seafaring out of Konassa,\nand there are several other busy seaports we know of. But no one in any\nof them ever heard of navigation out of sight of land, let alone trying\nit. There's nothing but pilotage, and even that's pretty sketchy. And,\nthere's this thing.\" He crossed to the workbench, picked up the sword,\nand stroked its blade.\n\n\"Normally,\" he mused, \"technical knowledge gets around. Part of it's\ndeveloped here, part there. Then someone comes along and puts it\ntogether. And someone else adds to it. And so on.\n\n\"Then, there are other times, when there's an abnormal source, or where\nthere are unusual conditions, and knowledge is very closely guarded.\nThis might be one of those cases, and those priests might be fronting\nfor someone very much in our line of business.\" He broke off.\n\n\"Any maedli hot?\"\n\n\"Sure.\" Banasel picked a pot from the heater and poured two cups.\n\n\"Think we should set up a base near Norlar and have a look?\"\n\n\"Probably be a good idea.\" Lanko accepted a cup, took a sip, and shook\nhis head violently.\n\n\"Ouch! I said hot, not boiling.\" He blew on the cup and set it aside to\nsteam itself cool.\n\n\"These mountains were an excellent base,\" he continued, \"but this area\nseems to be developing perfectly. There's no outside interference, all\ntraces of former interference have been eliminated, and there's very\nlittle excuse for us to hang around.\" He picked up the cup again,\ncautiously sampling its contents. \"And it's about time we moved around\nand checked on the rest of the planet.\"\n\nBanasel turned back to the workbench. \"Good idea,\" he agreed. \"I'll get\nthis scanner set up again, and we'll be ready to load out.\" He picked up\nhis tools. \"As I remember, Norlar has a mountainous backbone where no\none ever goes. We should be able to set up right on the island.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the eastern slope of the Midra Kran, a cloud of dust paced a caravan,\nwhich wound up the trail, through a pass. The treachery of the narrow\npath was testified to by an occasional slither, followed by a startled\ncurse.\n\nMusa stood in his stirrups, looking ahead at the long trail which\ntwisted a little farther up, then dropped to the wide Jogurthan plateau.\nFar ahead, over the poorly marked way, he knew, was another range, the\nSoruna Kran, which blocked his way to the Eastern Sea.\n\nHe looked back at the straggling caravan.\n\n\"Better get them to close up, Baro,\" he remarked. \"We'd be in a lot of\ntrouble if a robber band caught us scattered like this.\"\n\nThe other trader nodded and turned his mount. Then, he paused as shouts\ncame from the rear of the line. Mixed with the shouting was the clatter\nof weapons.\n\n\"Come on,\" cried Musa. \"It's happened.\"\n\nHe kicked his mount in the ribs, and swung about, starting up the steep\nbank. The bandits would have bowmen posted to deal with anyone who might\ntry to get back along the narrow path, and he had no desire to test the\naccuracy of their aim.\n\nAs his beast scrambled up the bank, Musa saw a man standing on a\npinnacle, alertly watching the center of the caravan. His guess had been\nright. The bandit leader's strategy had been to cut the caravan in two,\nand to deal with the rear guard first. As the watcher started to aim at\nsomething down on the trail, Musa quickly raised his own bow and sent an\narrow to cut the man down before he could fire.\n\nIt was a good shot. The man made no sound as the arrow struck, but\nclawed for an instant at the shaft in his side, then dropped, to slide\ndown the face of a low cliff. Musa, followed by his guards, stormed up\nthe slope.\n\nThey went through a saddle in the hill, to find themselves confronted by\na half dozen men, who swung about, trying to bring their bows to bear on\nthe unexpected targets. Two of these went down as arrows sang through\nthe air, then the traders were upon the rest, swords flailing, too close\nfor archery.\n\nOne of the bandits swung his sword wildly at Musa, who had drawn a twin\nto that blade he had sold back in Karth. The slender shaft of steel rang\nagainst the bandit's bronze blade, deflecting it, then Musa made a quick\nthrust which passed through the man's leather shield, to penetrate\nflesh. The bronze weapon sagged, and its holder staggered. Musa jerked\nback violently, disengaged his sword, and made a swift cut. For an\ninstant, the bandit sat his mount, staring at his opponent. Then, he\nslumped, and rolled loosely from his saddle.\n\nThe action had been fast. Only one bandit, a skilled swordsman,\nremained, to keep Baro busy. Musa rode quickly behind him, thrusting as\nhe passed. Baro looked across the limp body.\n\n\"Now, what did you have to do that for?\" he demanded. \"I was having a\ngood time.\"\n\n\"Let's get down to the trail again,\" Musa told him. \"We can have a\nwonderful time there.\" He pointed.\n\nThe caravan's rear guard was in trouble. Several of them were in the\ndust of the trail, and the survivors were being pressed by a number of\ndetermined swordsmen.\n\nBaro wheeled and slid down the incline, closely followed by the rest of\nthe group.\n\nThe surrounded bandits fought desperately, but hopelessly. The charge\nfrom the hill had driven them off balance, and they were never given a\nchance to recover. At last, Musa and Baro looked over the results of the\nraid.\n\nThey had lost several guards. One trader, Klaron, had been killed by an\narrow launched early in the attack. Several of the survivors were\nwounded.\n\n\"We'll have to hire some more guards and drivers in Jogurth,\" said Baro.\n\"And what are we going to do about Klaron's goods?\"\n\n\"We can divide them and sell them in Jogurth,\" Musa told him. \"Klaron\nhas a brother back in Karth who can use the money, and money's a lot\neasier to carry than goods. You'll see him on your return trip.\"\n\nBaro nodded, and started up the line, reorganizing the caravan. At last,\nthey got under way again, and resumed their slow way toward the plateau.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe caravan went on, to enter the plateau, where the traders started\nresting by day and traveling by night, to avoid exertion during the\nday's heat.\n\nThey came to the city of Jogurth, which for most of them was a terminal.\nFrom there, they would return to Karth, a few possibly going on to their\nhomes still farther west. Musa stayed in town for a few days, trading\nhis few remaining eastern goods for locally produced articles, and\nhelping in the sale of Klaron's goods. At last, he joined another\ncaravan, headed by an old trader, Kerunar, who habitually traveled\nbetween Jogurth and Manotro, on the east coast.\n\nThe trip across the Soruna Kran was uneventful, and Musa finally saw the\nglint of the Eastern Sea. He did not stay long in Manotro, for he\ndiscovered that the small channel ships traveled frequently, and he was\nable to guide his pack beasts to the wharf, where his bales were\naccepted for shipment. Leaving his goods, he led his animals back to the\nmarket.\n\nOld Kerunar shook his head when he saw Musa. \"Be careful, son,\" he\ncautioned. \"I've been coming here for twenty years. Used to trade in\nNorlar, too. But you couldn't get me over there now for ten thousand\ncaldor.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" Musa looked at him curiously. \"What's wrong?\"\n\nKerunar looked at his newly set up booth. Hung about it were durable\ngoods and trinkets from a dozen cities. There were articles even from\nfar-off Telon, in the Konassan gulf. He looked back at Musa.\n\n\"Norlar,\" he declared, \"has fallen into the hands of thieves and\nmurderers. You can trade there, to be sure. You can even make a profit.\nBut you cannot be sure you will not excite the avarice of the Kondarans,\nor arouse their anger. For they have a multitude of strange laws, which\nthey can invoke against anyone, and which they enforce with\nconfiscation of goods. Death or slavery await any who protest their\nactions or question their rules.\" He paused.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Some manage to trade, and come back with profitable bales. Some leave\ntheir goods in the hands of the priests of Kondaro. Some remain, to find\na quick death. But I stop here. I prefer to deal with honorable men.\nWhen I face the thief or the bandit, I prefer to have a weapon in my\nhand. A book of strange laws can be worse than any bandit born.\"\n\nMusa looked about the market. \"Here, of course,\" he acknowledged, \"are\nthe goods of the Far East. But I must see them at their source.\" He\nshook his head. \"No,\" he decided, \"I shall make one trip at least.\"\n\n\"I'll give you just one word of caution, then,\" he was told. \"Whatever\nyou see, make little comment. Whenever you are asked for an offering,\nmake no objection, but give liberally. Keep your eyes open and your\nopinions to yourself.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\" Musa grinned. \"I'll try to remember.\"\n\n\"Don't just remember. Follow the advice, if you wish to return.\"\n\nMusa's grin widened. \"I'll be back,\" he promised.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe harbor of Tanagor, chief seaport of Norlar, was full of shipping.\nHere were the ships which plied the trackless wastes of the Eastern Sea.\nHuge, red-sailed, broad-beamed, they rode at anchor in the harbor,\nserved by small galleys from the city. Tied up at the wharves, were the\nsmaller, yellow and white-sailed ships which crossed the channel between\nthe mainland and the island empire.\n\nSlowly, Musa's ship drew in toward the wharf, where a shouting gang of\nporters and stevedores awaited her arrival. Together with other\npassengers, Musa stood at the rail, watching the activity on the pier.\n\nFour slaves, bearing a crimson curtained litter, came to the wharf and\nstopped. The curtains opened, and a man stepped out. He was not large,\nnor did his face or figure differ from the normal. But his elegantly\nembroidered crimson and gold robes made him a colorfully outstanding\nfigure, even on this colorful waterfront. And the imperious assurance of\nhis bearing made him impossible to ignore.\n\nHe adjusted his strangely shaped, flat cap, glanced about the wharf\nhaughtily, and beckoned to one of the slaves, who reached inside the\nlitter and took from it an ornately decorated crimson chest. Another\nslave joined him, and the two, carrying the chest with every evidence of\nreverent care, followed their crimson-cloaked master as he strode into a\npier office.\n\nMusa turned to one of the other merchants, his eyebrows raised\ninquiringly.\n\n\"A priest of Kondaro,\" whispered the other. \"In this land, they are\nsupreme. Take care never to anger one of them, or to approach too\nclosely to the sacred chest their slaves carry. To do so can mean prompt\nexecution.\"\n\nAs Musa started to thank the man for his friendly warning, a cry of\n\"Line Ho!\" caused him to turn his attention to the mooring parties.\nLines had been cast aboard at bow and stern, and the ship was rapidly\nbeing secured to stout bollards ashore.\n\nA gang of stevedores quickly rigged a gangway amidships, and porters\ncommenced streaming aboard to carry the cargo ashore. Another gangway\nwas rigged aft for the passengers. At the foot of this, stood one of the\npriest's litter bearers, a slave with a crimson loincloth. In his hands,\nhe held a large, red bowl, which was decorated with intricate gold\ndesigns. Beside him, stood his companion, a sturdy, frowning fellow, who\nheld a large, strangely shaped sword in his hand. Musa's previous mentor\nleaned toward him nodding to the group.\n\n\"Don't forget or fail to put a coin in that bowl,\" he cautioned.\n\"Otherwise, you'll never get passage on one of the sacred ships.\"\n\n\"How much?\" queried Musa.\n\n\"The more, the better. If you want quick passage across the Great Sea,\nbetter make it at least ten caldor.\"\n\nMusa shrugged, reaching into his purse for a gold coin.\n\n\"Maybe I should be in the priesthood myself, instead of the trading\nbusiness,\" he told himself silently.\n\nAs he passed the bowl, he noted that the other trader dropped only a\nsilver piece. On the wharf, the incoming passengers were being guided\ninto groups. Musa noted that his group was the smallest, and that his\nprevious friend had gone to another, larger group. An official, tablet\nin hand, approached.\n\n\"Your name, Traveler?\"\n\n\"Musa, trader, of Karth.\"\n\n\"You have goods?\"\n\n\"I brought twelve bales. They are marked with my name.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir. We will hold them for your disposal. You may claim them\nat any time after mid-day.\" The man wrote rapidly on his tablet.\n\nMusa thanked him, then turned to see how his shipboard acquaintance was\nprogressing. He had questions to ask about gold and silver coins.\n\nHe watched the older merchant complete his conversation with an\nofficial, and, as he started to leave the wharf, quickly caught up with\nhim. At Musa's approach, the other held up a hand.\n\n\"I know,\" he said. \"Why did I tell you to make a generous offering, then\nput a smaller coin in the bowl myself? That is what you want to know?\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" Musa replied. \"I'm not a poor man, but I'm not a wealthy\nholiday seeker, either. This voyage has to pay.\"\n\nThe other smiled. \"Exactly why I advised you as I did. Come into this\nwineshop, and I'll tell you the story.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOver the drinks, the older man explained himself. An experienced trader,\nhe had been operating between the mainland and Norlar for many years. It\nhad been a profitable business, for the island had been dependent upon\nthe mainland for many staple items, and had in return furnished many\nitems of exquisite craftsmanship, as well as the produce of its\nextensive fisheries and pearl beds.\n\nThen, the prophet, Sira Nal, had come with his preachings of a great sea\ngod, Kondaro, ruler of the Eastern Sea. Tonda told of the unbelief that\nhad confronted the prophet, and of the positive proof that Sira Nal had\noffered, when he had gathered a group of converts, collected enough\nmoney to purchase a ship, and made a highly successful voyage to the\ndistant lands to the east. Upon his return, Sira Nal had found a ready\nmarket for the strange and wonderful products he had brought. He also\nhad found many more converts for his new religion.\n\nHis original group, now a priesthood, were the only men who could give\nprotection and guidance to a ship in a voyage past the sea demons who\nfrequented the Eastern Sea, and they demanded large offerings to\ncompensate for their services. Of course, a few adventurous shipowners\nhad attempted to duplicate Sira Nal's feat without the aid of a priest,\nbut no living man had seen their ships or crews again.\n\nThe profits from the rich, new trade, plus the alms of the traders\nvisiting Tanagor, had rapidly filled the coffers of Kondaro. A great\ntemple had been built, and the priests had become more and more\npowerful, until now, not too many years after the first voyage of Sira\nNal, they virtually ruled the island.\n\nFor some years, Tonda, a conservative man and a firm believer in his own\nancestral gods, had paid little attention to this strange, new religion.\nUpon arrival at Tanagor, to be sure, he had sometimes placed small\nofferings in the votive bowl, but more often, he had merely strode past\nthe Slave of Kondaro, and gone upon his affairs.\n\nAt last, however, attracted by the great profits in the new, oversea\ntrade, he had decided to arrange for a voyage in one of the great ships.\nThen, the efficiency of the priestly bookkeeping methods had become\napparent. The Great God had become incensed at Tonda's impiety during\nhis many previous trips across the channel, and a curse had been placed\nupon him and upon his goods. Of course, if Tonda wished to do penance,\nand to make votive offerings, amounting to about two thousand caldor, it\nmight be that the Great God would relent and allow his passage, but only\nwith new goods. His former possessions had been destroyed by the angry\nKondaro in his wrath at Tonda's attempts to place them in one of the\nsacred ships. Empty-handed, Tonda had returned to the mainland.\n\n\"But why did you return with more goods?\" inquired Musa.\n\nTonda smiled. \"The wrath of Kondaro extends only to the Great Sea. And,\neven though I cannot go farther east, trade here in Tanagor is quite\nprofitable.\" He paused, smiling, as he sipped his drink.\n\n\"I think the priests like having a few penitents around to explain\nthings to newcomers, and to furnish examples of the power of Kondaro.\"\n\nMusa smiled in response. \"But my ten caldor make me and my goods\nacceptable?\"\n\nTonda looked around quickly, then turned a horrified face toward his\nprot\u00e9g\u00e9.\n\n\"Never say such things,\" he cautioned in a low tone of voice. \"Don't\neven think them. Your piety makes you acceptable, so long as you\ncontinue in a way pleasing to the great Kondaro. The money means\nnothing. It is only the spirit of sacrifice that counts.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Musa's face was solemn. \"And how else may I be sure I will\nremain acceptable?\"\n\nTonda nodded approvingly. \"I thought you were a man of good sense and\nprudence.\" He launched into a description of the technicalities of the\nworship of Kondaro, the god of the Eastern Sea.\n\nAt length, Musa left his tutor, and repaired to an inn, where he secured\nlodging for the night.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe following morning, in obedience to the advice given him by Tonda,\nMusa took his way toward the Temple of the Sea. As he threaded through\nthe crowds already gathering in the streets, he took note of the types\nof merchandise displayed in the booths, and hawked by the street\npeddlers. Suddenly, one of these roving sellers approached him. In his\nhands he held a number of ornaments.\n\n\"Good day to you, oh Traveler,\" he cried. \"Surely, it is a fortunate\nmorning for both of us.\" With a deft gesture, he threw one of the\ntrinkets, a cunningly contrived amulet, about Musa's neck.\n\nMusa would have brushed the man aside, but the chain of the amulet had\ntangled about his neck and he was forced to pause while removing it.\n\n\"I told myself when I saw you,\" the man continued, \"ah, Banasel, here is\none who should be favored by the gods. Now, how can such a one venture\nupon the Eastern Sea without a sacred amulet?\"\n\nMusa had slipped the chain over his head. He paused, holding the\nornament in his hand. \"How, then, are you to know where I am going?\"\n\n\"Oh, Illustrious Traveler,\" exclaimed the man, \"how can I fail to know\nthese things when it is given to me to vend these amulets of great\nfortune?\"\n\nIn spite of himself, Musa was curious. He looked at the amulet. There\nwas no question as to the superb workmanship, and his trading instincts\ntook over.\n\n\"Why, this is a fair piece of work,\" he said. \"Possibly I could spare a\ncaldor or so.\"\n\nThe man before him struck his forehead.\n\n\"A caldor, he says! Why, the gold alone is worth ten.\"\n\nMusa looked more closely at the ornament. The man was probably not\nexaggerating too much. Actually, he knew he could get an easy\ntwenty-five balata for the bauble in Karth. A rapid calculation told him\nthat here was a possible profit from the skies.\n\n\"Why, possibly it is worth five, at that,\" he said. \"Look, I'll be\ngenerous. Shall we say six?\"\n\n\"Oh, prince of givers! Thou paragon of generosity! After all, I, too,\nmust live.\" The man smiled wryly. \"However, you are a fine, upstanding\nyoung man, and one must make allowance. I had thought to ask twenty, but\nwe'll make it ten. Just the price of the gold.\"\n\nMusa smiled inwardly. The profit was secured, but maybe--\n\n\"Let's make it eight, and I'll give you my blessing with the money.\"\n\nThe man held out his hand. \"Nine.\"\n\nMusa shrugged. \"Very well, most expert of vendors.\" He reached into his\npurse.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBanasel hesitated before accepting the money. He looked Musa over\ncarefully, then nodded as if satisfied.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said softly, \"I was right.\" He paused, then addressed himself\ndirectly to Musa.\n\n\"We must be very careful to whom we sell these enchanted amulets,\" he\nexplained, \"for they are talismans of the greatest of powers. The wearer\nof one of these need never fear the unjust wrath of man, beast, or\ndemon, for he has powerful protectors at his call. Only wear this charm.\nNever let it out of your possession, and you will have nothing to fear\nduring your voyage. Truly, you will be most favored.\"\n\nHe looked sharply at Musa again, took the money, glanced at it, and\ndropped it into a pouch.\n\n\"Do you really believe in the powers of your ornaments, then?\" Musa\nasked skeptically.\n\nBanasel's eyes widened, and he spread his arms. \"To be sure,\" he said in\na devout tone. \"How can I believe else, when I have seen their\nmiraculous workings so often?\" He held up a hand. \"Why, I could spend\nhours telling you of the powers these little ornaments possess, and of\nthe miracles they have been responsible for. None have ever come to harm\nwhile wearing one of these enchanted talismans. None!\" He spread his\narms again.\n\nMusa looked at him curiously. \"I should like to hear your stories some\nday,\" he said politely.\n\nHe felt uncomfortable, as many people do when confronted by a confessed\nfanatic. His feelings were divided between surprise, a mild contempt,\nand an unease, born of wonder and uncertainty.\n\nObviously, the man was not especially favored. He was dressed like any\nstreet peddler. He had the slightly furtive, slightly brazen air of\nthose who must avoid the anger, and sometimes the notice, of more\npowerful people, and yet, who must ply their trade. But he talked\ngrandly of the immense powers of the baubles he vended, seeming to hold\nthem in a sort of reverence. And, when he had spread his arms, there had\nbeen a short-lived hint of suppressed power. Musa shuddered a little.\n\n\"But I must go to the temple now, if I am to make arrangements for my\nvoyage,\" he added apologetically. He turned away, then hurried down the\nstreet.\n\nBanasel watched him go, a slight smile growing on his face.\n\n\"I don't blame you, Pal,\" he chuckled softly. \"I'd feel the same way\nmyself.\"\n\nHe glanced around noting a narrow alley. Casually, he walked into it,\nthen looked around carefully. No one could observe him. He straightened,\ndropping the slightly disreputable, hangdog manner, then reached for his\nbody shield controls.\n\nQuickly, he cut out visibility, then actuated the levitator modulation\nand narrowed out of the alley, rose over the city, and headed toward the\nrugged mountains that formed the backbone of the island.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLanko was waiting, and quickly lowered the base shield.\n\n\"Well,\" he asked, \"how did it go?\"\n\n\"I found him.\" Banasel walked over to the cabinets, and started sorting\nthe goods he had been carrying. \"Sold him a miniature communicator. Now,\nI hope he wears the thing.\"\n\n\"We'll have to keep a close watch on him,\" commented Lanko, \"just in\ncase he puts it in his luggage and forgets about it. Did you give him a\ngood sales talk?\"\n\n\"Sure. Told him to wear it always. I pawed the air, raved a little, and\nmade him think I was crazy. But I've an idea he'll remember and grab the\nthing if he sees trouble coming.\" Banasel put the last ornament in its\nplace, and started unhooking his personal equipment. Then, he turned.\n\n\"Look,\" he commented, \"why bother with all this mystic business? We've\ngot mentacoms. Why not just clamp onto him, and keep track of him that\nway? It'd be a lot simpler. Less chance of a slip, too.\"\n\n\"Yeah, sure it would.\" Lanko gave his companion a disgusted look. \"But\nhave you ever tried that little trick?\"\n\n\"No. I never had the occasion, but I've seen guardsmen run remote\nsurveillances, and even exert control when necessary. They didn't have\nany trouble. We could try it, anyway.\"\n\nLanko sat up. \"We could try it,\" he admitted, \"but I know what would\nhappen. I did try it once, and I found out a lot of things--quick.\" He\nlooked into space for a moment. \"How old are you, Banasel?\"\n\n\"Why, you know that. I'm forty-one.\"\n\nLanko nodded. \"So am I,\" he said. \"And our civilization is a few\nthousand years old. And our species is somewhat older than that. We were\nin basic Guard training, and later in specialist philosophical training\ntogether. It took ten years, remember?\"\n\n\"Sure. I remember every minute of it.\"\n\n\"Of course you do. It was that kind of training. But how old do you\nthink some of those young guardsmen we worked with were?\"\n\n\"Why, most of 'em were kids, fresh from school.\"\n\n\"That they were. But how many years--our years--had they spent in their\nschooling? How old were the civilizations they came from? And how old\nwere their species?\"\n\nLanko eyed him wryly.\n\nBanasel looked thoughtfully across the room. \"I never thought of it that\nway. Why, I suppose some of their forefathers were worrying about space\ntravel before this planet was able to support life. And, come to think\nof it, I remember one of them making a casual remark about 'just a\nperiod ago,' when he was starting citizen training.\"\n\n\"That's what I mean.\" Lanko nodded emphatically. \"'Just a period.' Only\nten or twelve normal lifetimes for our kind of people. And his\ncivilization's just as old compared to ours as he is compared to\nus--older, even.\n\n\"During that period he was so casual about, he was learning--practicing\nwith his mind, so that the older citizens of the galaxy could make full\ncontact with him without fear of injuring his mentality. He was learning\nconcepts that he wouldn't dare even suggest to you or to me. Finally,\nafter a few more periods, he'll begin to become mature. Do you think we\ncould pick up all the knowledge and training back of his handling of\ntechnical equipment in a mere ten years of training?\"\n\nBanasel reached up, taking the small circlet from his head. He held it\nin his hand, looking at it with increased respect.\n\n\"You know,\" he admitted, \"I really hadn't thought of it that way. They\ntaught me to repair these things, among other pieces of equipment, and\nmost of the construction is actually simple. They taught me a few uses\nfor it, and I thought I understood it.\n\n\"Of course, I knew we were in contact with an advanced culture, and I\nknew that most of those guys we treated so casually had something that\ntook a long time in the getting, but I didn't stop to think of the real\nstretch of time and study involved.\" He leaned back, replacing the\nmentacom on his head. \"Somehow, they didn't make it apparent.\"\n\n\"Of course they didn't.\" Lanko spread his hands a little. \"One doesn't\ndeliberately give children a feeling of inferiority.\"\n\n\"Yeah. Will we ever learn?\"\n\n\"Some. Some day. But we've got a long, lonely road to travel first.\"\nLanko stood up and adjusted the communicator.\n\n\"Right now, though, we'd better keep tabs on Musa. In fact, we'd better\nfollow him when he leaves here.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe temple of Kondaro, the sea god, had been built at the edge of a\ncliff, so that it overlooked the Eastern Sea. The huge, white dome\nfurnished a landmark for mariners far out at sea, and dominated the\nwaterfront of Norlar. Atop the dome, a torch provided a beacon to\nrelieve the blackness of moonless nights. This was the home of the\ncrimson priests, and the center of guidance for all who wished to sail\neastward.\n\nMusa stood for some time, admiring the temple, then walked between the\ncarefully clipped hedges and up the long line of steps leading to the\narched entrance.\n\nAgain, he stopped. Overhead, the curved ceiling of the main dome was\nlower than its outer dimensions would lead one to believe, but Musa\nhardly noticed that. He gazed about the main rotunda.\n\nIt was predominantly blue. The dome was a smooth, blue sky, and the\nsmooth blueness continued down the walls. The white stone steps were\nterminated at the edges of a mosaic sea, which stretched to the far\nwalls, broken only by a large statue of the sea god. Kondaro stood in\nthe center of his temple, facing the entrance. One arm stretched out,\nthe hand holding a torch, while the other arm cradled one of the great\nships favored by the god. Beneath one foot was one of the batlike sea\ndemons, its face mirroring ultimate despair. About the feet lapped\nconventionally sculptured waves, which melted into the mosaic, to be\ncontinued to the walls by the pattern of the tiles. At the far side of\nthe rotunda, the double stairs, which led to bronze doors, were almost\ninconspicuous, seeming to be a vaguely appearing mirage on the horizon\nof a limitless sea.\n\nThe trader looked at the far side, then down, and hesitated, feeling as\nthough he were about to walk on water. Then, he turned, remembering the\npedestal nearby. A crimson bowl rested on this stand, and beside it was\na slave in the crimson loincloth which marked the menials of Kondaro.\n\nMusa stepped over to the pedestal, dropped a coin into the bowl, and\nwalked toward the rear of the temple, making proper obeisance to the\nhuge statue. A young priest approached him.\n\n\"I crave blessings for a voyage I propose to take,\" announced the\ntrader.\n\nThe priest inclined his head.\n\n\"Very well, Traveler, follow me.\"\n\nHe led the way to a small office. An older priest sat at a large table,\nreading a tablet. Conveniently placed were writing materials, and on the\ntable before him was another votive bowl. Musa dropped a coin into the\nbowl, and the priest looked up.\n\n\"I bring a voyager, O, Wise One,\" said the young priest.\n\n\"It is well,\" the older priest acknowledged in a deep voice. He turned\nto Musa. \"Your name, Voyager?\"\n\nMusa gave his name, his age, the amount of his goods, and an account of\nhis actions since his arrival in Tanagor. At the mention of Tonda, the\npriest nodded.\n\n\"The actions of Tonda have been most exemplary for the past several\nseasons,\" he remarked. \"He is a good man, but he lacks the proper spirit\nof sacrifice.\" He concluded his writing.\n\n\"Well, then, Musa, you may go to those who sail ships with the blessing\nof Kondaro upon you. I shall only caution you as to the observance of\nthe rites and laws for those who sail the Great Sea. Go now, in peace.\"\n\nAs Musa turned, the younger priest spoke. \"I will lead you to one who\nwill give you further guidance,\" he said.\n\nMusa followed him to another small room, where he met still another\npriest. This man, he discovered, was a shrewd trader in his own right.\nHe was familiar with goods and their values, and in addition to the\nrites he described, he presented definite advice as to what to take and\nwhat to leave behind. Fortunately, Musa discovered as he talked to this\npriest, he had picked very nearly as good a selection as he could wish.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nDuring the days that followed, Musa made more votive offerings,\npracticed the rites ordered by the priest, and watched his goods as they\nwere delivered to the _Bordeklu_, a ship belonging to Maladro, beloved\nof Kondaro, a shipowner whose ships were permitted by the sea god and\nhis priests to sail the Eastern Sea.\n\nAt last, the day arrived when Musa himself boarded the ship and set sail\npast the headland of Norlar.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs the ship was warped out of the harbor, Musa took stock of his fellow\npassengers. Among them were a slender, handsome man named Ladro, who had\nbeen on many previous voyages to the land of the East, and Min-ta, a\nnative of the eastern continent, who was returning from a trading voyage\nto Norlar. There were several others, but they kept to themselves,\nseeming to radiate an aura of exclusiveness. Ladro and Min-ta on the\nother hand, were more approachable.\n\n_Surely_, thought Musa, _these two can teach me a great deal of the land\nI am to visit, if they will_.\n\nHe walked over to the rail, where the two stood, looking out over the\nshoreline. The ship was coming abreast of the great temple of Kondaro.\n\n\"It's the most prominent landmark on the island, isn't it?\" Musa\ncommented.\n\n\"What?\" Ladro turned, looking at him curiously. \"Oh, yes,\" he said, \"the\ntemple. Yes, it's the last thing you see as you leave, and the first\nwhen you return.\" He paused, examining Musa. \"This is your first trip?\"\n\n\"Yes, it is. I've always traded ashore before this.\"\n\n\"But you finally decided to visit Kneuros?\"\n\n\"Yes. I've dealt with a few traders who had goods from there, and their\nstories interested me.\"\n\nLadro smiled. \"Romance of the far places?\"\n\n\"Well, there's that, too,\" Musa admitted, \"but I'm interested in some of\nthe merchandise I've seen.\"\n\n\"There's profit in it,\" agreed Ladro. \"How long have you been trading\naround Norlar?\"\n\n\"This is my first trip. I'm from Karth, in the Galankar.\"\n\n\"You mean you were never in Norlar before?\" Min-ta joined the\nconversation.\n\nMusa shook his head. \"I left Karth for the purpose of trading east of\nthe Great Sea.\"\n\n\"Unusual,\" mused Min-ta. \"Most traders work between Tanagor and the\nmainland for several years before they try the Sea.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" added Ladro, \"and some never go out. They satisfy themselves with\nthe channel trade.\" He pointed. \"We're getting out to the open sea now,\npast the reef.\"\n\nThe ship drew away from the island kingdom, setting its course toward\nthe vague horizon. The day wore on, to be replaced by the extreme\nblackness of night. Then, the sky lit up again, heralding another day.\n\nThe ship's company had settled to sea routine, and the traders roamed\nabout their portion of the deck, talking sometimes, or napping in the\nsun. Musa leaned over the low rail, watching the water, and admiring the\nclear, blue swells.\n\nHe raised his head as the door of the forward cabins opened. A priest,\nfollowed by a group of slaves, went up to the raised forecastle. Under\nthe priest's direction, the slaves busied themselves putting up a high,\ncrimson and yellow curtain across the foredeck. They completed their\ntask and went below.\n\nAgain, the door opened, and a procession, headed by the chief priest,\nslowly mounted the ladder to the forecastle. Each of the three priests\nwas followed by his slave, who bore a crimson casket. The curtain closed\nbehind them, then the slaves came out and ranged themselves across the\ndeck, facing aft.\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Musa, turning to Ladro, \"what ritual they are\nperforming.\"\n\nLadro shook his head. \"The less a man knows of the activities of the\npriests, the better he fares,\" he declared. \"Truly, on a great ship,\ncuriosity is a deadly vice.\"\n\nMusa nodded to the stern. \"I see that one of the priests is not at the\nbow.\"\n\n\"That is right. One priest always remains by the steersman, to ward off\nthe spells of the sea demons.\" Ladro paused, pointing overside. \"See,\"\nhe said in a pleased tone, \"here is an envoy from Kondaro.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMusa's gaze followed the pointing finger. A huge fish was cruising\nalongside, gliding effortlessly through the waves, and occasionally\nleaping into the air.\n\n\"An envoy?\"\n\n\"Yes. So long as a kontar follows a ship, fair weather and smooth\nsailing may be expected. They are sent by Kondaro as guardians for\nthose ships he especially favors.\"\n\nAt a call from the priest in the stern, two sailors appeared, carrying\nchunks of meat. As the priest chanted, they tossed these overside. The\ngreat fish rose from the water, catching one of the chunks as it fell,\nthen dropped back, and the water frothed whitely as he retrieved the\nother. He gulped the meat, then swam contentedly, still pacing the ship.\n\n\"Suppose someone fell overboard?\" Musa gazed at the kontar in\nfascination.\n\nLadro and Min-ta exchanged glances.\n\n\"If one is favored by the Great One,\" replied Min-ta slowly, \"it is\nbelieved that the kontar would guard him from harm. Otherwise, the\nsacrifice would be accepted.\"\n\nMusa looked at the clear water, then glanced back to the spot of foam\nwhich drew astern.\n\n\"I don't believe I'll try any swimming from the ship.\" He backed\nslightly from the rail, glancing quickly at Ladro and Min-ta, then\nlooking away again.\n\nHe suddenly realized that he had exceeded his quota of questions, and\nthat he could get into trouble. He had noted that most of the ship's\ncompany appeared to know the other traders aboard, even though some of\nthem hadn't been to sea before. Min-ta and Ladro were obviously well\nacquainted with several of the ship's officers. But he, Musa, was a\nstranger.\n\nHe had already observed that the priesthood of Kondaro was not averse to\na quick profit, and that they placed a low value on the lives and\npossessions of others. He had dealt with tribes ashore, who had the\nsimple, savage ethic:\n\n\"He is a stranger? Kill him! Take his goods, and kill him.\"\n\nAshore, he had protected himself during his many trips by consorting\nwith other traders of good reputation, and by hiring guards. But here?\nHe remembered the remarks made by Kerunar back in Manotro.\n\n\"When I face the thief or the bandit, I prefer to have a weapon in my\nhand.\"\n\nSlowly, he collected himself, and looked back at Ladro and Min-ta.\n\n\"If you gentlemen will excuse me,\" he apologized, \"I have some accounts\nto cast, so I believe I'll go to my quarters.\" He turned and went below.\n\nAs he disappeared down the ladder, Ladro turned to his companion.\n\n\"Of course,\" he said thoughtfully, \"if all goes well, this man will be\nmost favored. But if the Great One shows signs of displeasure--\"\n\nMin-ta nodded. \"Yes,\" he agreed, \"I have heard of strangers who excited\nthe wrath of Kondaro.\" His eyes narrowed speculatively. \"Those of the\nfaithful who keep watch on such unfavored beings are rewarded by the\npriests, I am told.\"\n\nLadro nodded. \"I believe that is correct,\" he agreed. \"We should be\nwatchful for impiety in any event.\" He stretched. \"Well, I think I shall\ntake a short nap before dinner.\"\n\nBelow, the traders' quarters were cramped. There was a small, common\nspace, with a table, over which hung the single light. About the\nbulkheads were curtained recesses, sufficiently large for a bunk and\nwith barely enough space for the occupant to stand. Musa closed the\ncurtains, and sat down on his bunk.\n\nOf course, he had no proof. There was no really logical sequence to\nprove that the situation was dangerous. There was no evidence that his\nfellow voyagers were other than honorable, well-intentioned men. But he\nsimply didn't feel right. He pulled his wooden chest from under the\nbunk, opened it, and looked through the small store of personal effects.\n\nThere was no weapon. The law of Kondaro forbade the carrying of those by\nother than the priests and their slaves. His attention was attracted by\na glitter, and he picked up the small amulet he had bought from the\npeddler in Norlar. Slowly, he turned it in his hands.\n\nIt was an unusual ornament, strangely wrought. He had never seen such\nfine, regular detail, even in the best handicraft. As he looked closer,\nhe could not see how it could have been accomplished with any of the\ninstruments he was familiar with, yet it must have been hand made,\nunless it were actually of supernatural origin.\n\nHe remembered the urgent seriousness of the peddler's attitude, and he\ncould recall some of his words. The man had spoken almost convincingly\nof powerful protectors, and Musa could foresee the need of such. He\nfound himself speaking.\n\n\"Oh, power that rests in this amulet,\" he said, \"if there is any truth\nin the peddler's words, I--\" He paused, his usual, hard, common sense\ntaking over.\n\n\"I'm being silly!\" He drew his hand back to throw the ornament into the\nchest. Then, he felt himself stopped. An irresistible compulsion seized\nhim, and he dazedly secured the amulet about his neck. Feeling sick and\nweak, he tucked it into his garments. Then, still moving in a daze, he\nleft the cabin and returned to the deck. He did not so much as try to\nresist the sudden desire.\n\nThe breeze made him feel a little better, but he was still shaken, and\nhis head ached violently. Little snatches of undefined memory tried to\ncreep into his consciousness, but he couldn't quite bring them into\nfocus. He turned toward the rail, and saw Min-ta still there.\n\n\"Well,\" commented the easterner, \"your accounts didn't take long.\"\n\nMusa smiled wanly. \"It was stuffy down there. I felt I had to come up\nfor some air.\"\n\nMin-ta nodded. \"It does get close in the quarters during the day.\" He\npointed alongside.\n\n\"We are favored still,\" he said. \"Another kontar has joined us.\"\n\nTwo of the great fish paced the ship, gliding and leaping effortlessly\nfrom wave to wave. Musa watched them.\n\n\"We must be favored indeed.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Min-ta smiled. \"May our favor last.\"\n\nMusa's head still ached, and the glints of the sun reflected from the\nwater made it worse. He looked aft, to the faint line where sky met\nwater. There was a low line of clouds. His gaze traveled along the\nhorizon, and he noted that the clouds seemed a little darker forward.\nStill, he felt uneasy, and alone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_\"See what I meant?\"_\n\n_\"Ooh! Yeah. Yeah, I see. What a backlash that was! I've got the\ngrandfather of all headaches, and I won't be able to think straight for\na week. Wonder how Musa feels--But I got results, anyway.\"_\n\n_\"Yes. You got results. So did I once, when I tried something similar.\nBut I'll live a long time before I try it again. How about you?\"_\n\n_\"Don't worry. Next time I try to exert direct mental control on another\nentity, this planet'll have space travel. Wonder if some klordon\ntablets'll help any.\"_\n\n_\"Might. Try one, then let's get busy and scatter a few more\ncommunicators around that ship. Be more practical than beating our\nbrains out.\"_\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs the days passed, Musa became familiar with the shipboard routine and\nlost some of his early uneasiness regarding his traveling companions. He\nbecame acquainted with other traders, finding them to be average men,\nengaged in the same trade as himself. He talked to members of the ship's\ncompany, and found them to be normal men, who worked at their trade in a\ncompetent manner. Only the four priests held aloof. Ignoring officers,\nsailors, and traders alike, they spoke only to their slaves, who passed\ntheir comments to the ship's company.\n\nOn the morning of the tenth day, Musa came to the deck, to find the sea\nrougher than usual. Waves rose, scattering their white plumes for the\nwind to scatter. Ahead, dark clouds hid the sky, and occasional spray\ncame aboard, spattering the deck and the passengers.\n\nJust outside the cabin entrance, a small knot of traders were gathered.\nAs Musa came out, they separated.\n\nMusa went over to the rail, looking overside at the waves. The two\nkontars were not in sight. He looked about, noting the sailors, who\nhurried about the deck and into the rigging, securing their ship for\nfoul weather. Close by, Ladro and Min-ta were talking.\n\n\"It is quite possible,\" said Ladro, \"that someone aboard has broken a\nlaw of the great Kondaro, and the kontars have gone to report the sin.\"\nHe glanced at Musa calculatingly.\n\n\"Yes,\" agreed Min-ta, \"we--\"\n\nAn officer, hurrying along the deck, stopped. \"All passengers will have\nto go below,\" he said. \"We're in for bad weather, and don't want to lose\nanyone overboard.\"\n\n\"Could this be the wrath of Kondaro?\" asked Ladro.\n\nThe officer glanced at him questioningly. \"It could be, yes. Why?\"\n\nAgain, Ladro cast a look at Musa, then he caught the seaman by the arm,\npulling him aside. The two engaged in a low-toned conversation,\ndirecting quick glances at Musa. At last, the officer nodded and went\naft, to approach one of the slaves of Kondaro.\n\nMusa started across the deck to the ladder, his heart thudding\npainfully. Surely, he thought, he had done nothing to offend even the\nmost particular of deities. Yet, the implications of Ladro's glances and\nhis conversation with the ship's officer were too obvious for even the\ndullest to misinterpret. Musa took a long, shuddering breath.\n\nHis fears on that other day had been well grounded, then.\n\nHe gazed at the lowering sky, then out at the waves. Where could a lone,\nfriendless man find help in this waste of wind and water?\n\nSlowly, he climbed down the ladder leading to his tiny cubicle.\n\nOnce inside, he again started checking over his personal items. There\nwas nothing there to help. Hopelessly, he looked at the collection in\nthe chest, then he got out a scroll of prose and went to the central\ntable to read in an effort to clear his mind of the immediate\ncircumstances.\n\nMinutes later, he went back to his bunk and threw the scroll aside.\nPossibly, he was just imagining that he was the target of a plot.\nPossibly there was a real sea god named Kondaro--an omnipotent sea\ndeity, who could tell when persons within his domain were too curious,\nor harbored impious thoughts, and who was capable of influencing the\nactions of the faithful.\n\nPossibly, his opinions of the priesthood had been noted and had\noffended. Or, perhaps, that peculiar little device he had seen a priest\nstudying was capable of warning the god that it had been profaned by an\nunsanctified gaze. Possibly, this storm was really the result of such a\nwarning. He was sure the priest hadn't seen him, but it could be that\nthe device itself might--\n\nMusa threw himself on his bunk.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA deep voice resonated through the room.\n\n\"Musa of Karth,\" it said, \"my master, Dontor, desires your presence on\ndeck.\"\n\nMusa came to his feet. Two of the slaves of Kondaro stood close by,\nswords in hand. One beckoned, then turned. Musa followed him into the\nshort passage, and up the ladder. As they gained the deck, the small\nprocession turned aft, to face the senior priest.\n\nDontor stood on the raised after deck, just in front of the helmsman.\nThe wind tugged at his gold and crimson robe, carrying it away from his\nbody, so that it rippled like a flag, and exposed the bright blue\ntrousers and jacket. Dontor, chief priest of the _Bordeklu_, stood\nimmobile, his arms folded, his feet braced against the sway of his\nvessel. As the trio below him stopped, he frowned down at them.\n\n\"Musa, of Karth,\" he intoned, \"it has been revealed to me that you have\ndisplayed undue curiosity as to the inner mysteries of the worship of\nthe Great God. In your conversations, you have hinted at knowledge\nforbidden any but the initiated.\n\n\"You came to us, a stranger, and we trusted you. But now, we are all\nfaced with the wrath of the Great One as a result of your impieties. A\nsacrifice, and only a sacrifice, will appease this wrath. Can you name\nany reason why we should protect you further, at the expense of our own\nlives? What say you?\"\n\nMusa stared up at him. The cotton in his throat had suddenly become\nthick, and intensely bitter. Unsuccessfully, he tried to swallow, and a\nmental flash told him that whatever he said, he was already convicted.\nRegardless of what defense he might offer, he knew he would be condemned\nto whatever punishment these people decided to deal out to him. And that\npunishment, he realized, would be death. He straightened proudly.\n\n\"Oh, priest,\" he said thickly, \"I am guilty of no crime. You, however,\nare about to commit a serious crime, which is beyond my power to\nprevent.\" He hesitated, then continued. \"Be warned, however, that if\nthere are any real gods above or below, you will receive punishment. The\ngods, unlike men, are just!\"\n\nAware of sudden motion in his direction, he rapidly finished.\n\n\"So, make your sacrifice, and then see if you can save your vessel from\nthe natural forces of wind and water.\"\n\nThe priest stiffened angrily.\n\n\"Blasphemy,\" he said. \"Blasphemy, of the worst sort.\" He looked away\nfrom Musa. \"I believe that in this case, the Great One will require the\nship's company to deal with you in their own way, that they may be\npurged of any contamination due to your presence.\" He raised his arms.\n\n\"Oh, Great Kondaro, Lord of all the seas, and the things within the\nseas,\" he began.\n\nMusa evaded the two slaves with a quick weave of his shoulders. Covering\nthe distance to the side of the ship with a few quick steps, he jumped\nover the rail. As he fell, the wind tore at him, and his windmilling\narms and legs failed to find any purchase to right him.\n\nHe hit the water with a splash and concussion that nearly knocked the\nbreath from his body, and promptly sank. As the water closed over his\nhead, he struck out with hands and feet in an effort to climb again to\nlight and air. His head broke the surface, and he flailed the water in\nan effort to keep his nose in air. The ship was drawing away from him,\nits storm sails set.\n\nAs he struggled in the water, he wondered if it was worth while. After\nall, he had only to allow himself to sink, and all his troubles would be\nover shortly. Wouldn't it be easier to do this than to continue\ntorturing himself with a hopeless fight?\n\nToo, he wondered if he had been right in leaving the ship, but he\nquickly dismissed that thought. The sea was impersonal, neither cruel\nnor kind. It was far better, he thought, to surrender to the forces of\nnature than to subject himself to the viciousness of angry men.\n\nSuddenly, a constraining force seized him. He instinctively fought to\nfree himself, then realized that he was being drawn upward, out of the\nwater. Possibly, he thought, the Great One wanted to speak to him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe rose swiftly through the air, passed through complete darkness for an\ninstant, then found himself in a small room. Two men stood facing him,\nboth of them vaguely familiar. As his mind refocused, Musa recognized\nthe peddler of amulets, then the herder to whom he had once sold a\nsword. They were strangely familiar, but they were in strange costumes.\nHe stared at them.\n\n\"Well, Musa,\" said the herder. \"I see you got into trouble.\"\n\nMusa blinked. \"Who are you?\" he demanded. \"How do you know of my\naffairs?\"\n\nThe peddler of amulets grinned. \"Why, we are old companions, Musa,\" he\nsaid. \"Of course, you have forgotten us, but we never forgot you.\" He\npointed.\n\n\"This is Resident Guardsman Lanko. I am Banasel, also of the Stellar\nGuard. Our job is to prevent just such situations as the one you just\nfound yourself in.\" His grin faded. \"That, and a few other things.\"\n\nMusa frowned. \"Stellar Guard? What is that?\"\n\nLanko studied him for a moment, then crossed the small room. \"You knew\nonce,\" he tossed over his shoulder, \"but you rejected the knowledge, and\nit had to be taken from you. Since you'll be working with us for a\nwhile, I think we will have to restore your memories. Perhaps you'll\nwant to retain them.\" He removed equipment from a cabinet.\n\n\"Some of this will have to be secondhand, since neither Banasel nor\nmyself have been in the spots shown. But some of it is firsthand.\"\n\nHis hand flicked a switch.\n\nA power unit hummed, and Musa found himself recalling a campsite near\nthe now destroyed and rebuilt city of Atakar. As the imposed mental\nblocks fell away, he remembered who Banasel and Lanko were. And he\nrealized why he had been drawn to them in the recent past.\n\nMemories of his days of slavery in Atakar flashed before his mind, and\nhe remembered the part these two had taken in his escape. He recalled\nthe days of banditry, and the strange visitors, who had brought with\nthem disturbing knowledge, and strange powers.\n\nHe saw the destruction of Atakar, and the capture of the galactic\ncriminals who had depraved that city. He shared the experiences of his\ntwo companions during their introduction to the advanced culture of the\nGalactic Federation, and he saw snatches of their training at Aldebaran\nBase. He went with them on some of their missions.\n\nThe humming stopped, and he looked up at the two.\n\n\"So,\" Lanko told him, \"now you know.\"\n\nMusa nodded. \"I turned something down, didn't I?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs Musa disappeared over the vessel's side, the priest, Dontor, lowered\nhis arms. Quickly turning the unscheduled event to advantage, he cried,\n\"We need worry no further, my children. The Great One has called this\nblasphemer to final account.\"\n\nHe turned to one of his juniors, lowering his voice.\n\n\"Go below, Alnar, and break out this man's goods. We must reward those\nwho informed us.\"\n\nThe junior bowed. \"Yes, sir.\" He hesitated. \"Will this storm blow over\nsoon?\" he queried.\n\nDontor smiled. \"You should have paid more attention to your course in\npractical seamanship,\" he chided. \"We are sailing fairly close hauled,\nso our speed is added to that of the wind. And, since storms move, it'll\npass us shortly.\" He pointed to the horizon.\n\n\"See that small break in the clouds? That indicates a possibility of\nclear weather beyond. We should be through the worst of the storm in a\nmatter of a few hours. And we'll never reach the really dangerous core\nof the storm, for we are passing through an edge of it. Our only problem\nis to keep from losing a mast during the time we are close to the\nstorm's heart.\" He paused, looking aloft.\n\n\"The crew is competent. They have the sails properly reefed, and, if\nnecessary, they can furl them in short order. What trouble can we have?\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir.\" The younger priest bowed again. \"I will make the\nnecessary arrangements for those goods.\"\n\nDontor stood for a moment, surveying the ship, then walked toward the\nhelm.\n\n\"If I am ever in charge of operations,\" he told himself, \"I will replace\nsome of these sailors by neophyte priests, and let them steer by their\nown compasses. This method is too cumbersome. Besides, the neophytes\nshould get to sea earlier, anyway.\"\n\nHe approached the pilot priest, who stood apart from the helmsman, his\nslave holding the little red box with the compass.\n\n\"How is our course?\"\n\nThe priest turned, then bowed. \"We are off course twelve degrees to the\nnorth, sir,\" he reported. \"I have instructed the helmsman to come as\nclose to the wind as possible.\"\n\nDontor nodded. \"Very good,\" he approved. \"Keep track of your time, and\nwe'll correct when we get a chance to shift course to the south. We can\ndetermine whatever final correction is necessary at noon sight\ntomorrow.\"\n\nAlnar came up the ladder to the quarterdeck. Approaching Dontor, he\nbowed in salute, then reported.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"The goods are ready, sir.\"\n\n\"Very well. Find those two traders and give them the usual ten per cent,\nthen bring me an inventory of the remainder.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMusa stood, fists clenched, facing the recorder play-back. \"The usual\nten per cent, he says! Why, I'd like to slaughter the lot of those\nmurdering thieves!\"\n\nLanko snapped off the switch. \"Don't blame them too much,\" he laughed.\n\"After all, they're only trying to make a living, and it's the only\ntrade they know.\"\n\nAs Musa nearly choked on his attempted reply, Banasel broke in.\n\n\"Sure,\" he chuckled. \"Besides, it's guys like them that keep guys like\nus in business.\"\n\nLanko noticed the horrified expression on Musa's face, and quickly\ncomposed himself. He put his hand on the man's shoulder.\n\n\"Look,\" he explained seriously, \"if we got so we took people like these\nto heart, we'd spend half our time getting psyched to unsnarl our own\nmental processes.\" He gestured to the reels of tape in a cabinet.\n\n\"Here, we have the records of hundreds of cases like this one. Some are\nworse, some are not so bad. Every one of them had to be--and\nwas--cracked by members of our Corps. This is just another of those\nminor, routine incidents that keep cropping up all over the galaxy. It's\nour problem now, and we'll get to work on it.\" He turned.\n\n\"Where do you want to start, Banasel?\"\n\n\"Well--competition's the life of trade.\"\n\n\"That comes later.\" Lanko shook his head. \"There's an alien or so to be\ntaken care of first, you know.\"\n\n\"I know. It's fairly obvious.\"\n\n\"So, we've got to find him--or them.\"\n\nMusa had regained his self-control. \"What about these birds in hand?\"\n\nBanasel shrugged. \"Small fry. We'll take care of them later.\" He walked\nover to the workbench, picking up Lanko's sword.\n\n\"I wondered about this before,\" he said. \"Now, I'm sure about it. It\nsimply doesn't match a normal technology for this period.\"\n\nMusa looked at him curiously. \"But there are a lot of those around\nNorlar,\" he said. \"They're a rarity in the Galankar, to be sure, but--\"\n\n\"That's what we mean,\" Lanko told him. \"Too many anachronisms. First, we\nhave this sword. Then, we meet these priests of Kondaro, who discuss\nmeteorology, navigation, and pilotage with considerable understanding.\nWe've had communicators planted on that ship for several days now, and I\nstill can't see how the technology was developed that allowed the\nmanufacture of some of their instruments. We should have noticed\nsomething wrong a long time ago.\n\n\"The priests use sextants, watches, compasses. And, just to make it\nworse, we have one video recording of a priest laying out a course on an\naccurate chart. He was using a protractor, which was divided into\nGalactic degrees. That was the clincher. Somebody's out of place, and\nwe've got to find him--or them.\"\n\nHe took the sword from Banasel. \"I think we'd better go on to the\neastern continent, see what we can find, then we can deal with our\nfriends. But first, Ban, you'd better run out a call for one of the\nSector Guardsmen to back us up if necessary. We could run into something\ntoo hot for us to handle.\"\n\nBanasel nodded and turned to the communicator. Lanko dropped into the\npilot seat, glanced at the screens, and moved controls. In the\nviewscreen, the sea tilted, drew farther away, then became a level,\nfeatureless blue expanse.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Well, here's your eastern continent. In fact, this is the city of\nKneuros. It's where you wanted to go, isn't it?\"\n\nMusa looked at Banasel thoughtfully.\n\n\"Yes,\" he admitted. \"It's where I thought I wanted to go, but now I\nreally know what I wanted in the first place.\"\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\n\"Certainly. I was restless. I thought I liked being a trader in Karth,\nand I was a fairly good trader, too. But I was just getting things at\nsecondhand. I turned down just what I really wanted, because it scared\nme. That was a long time ago.\" He looked at the control panel. He'd\nunderstood such panels once, some years ago.\n\n\"How do you plan to find your aliens--if there are any?\"\n\n\"Search pattern.\" Lanko shrugged. \"We'll cruise around in a grid pattern\nuntil we pick up some sort of reading, or until we spot something\nabnormal.\" He pointed at a series of instruments.\n\n\"They're bound to have a ship somewhere, and we'll pick up a small\namount of power radiation from their screens. If their ship were\norbiting in space, we'd have picked it up long ago, so we must assume\nit's grounded. I think we'd better go right into a pattern. We can use\nKneuros as origin.\" He stared at the plotting instruments.\n\n\"Let's see. If I wanted to hide a ship, I'd use the most inaccessible\nlocation I could find. We do that ourselves, in fact. And there are some\nmountainous regions inland.\" He set up course and speed.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Banasel added, \"and I'd worry a lot more about ground approach\nthan air accessibility, at least on this planet.\"\n\nThe ship gained altitude, accelerated, and sped eastward.\n\nDay by day, the course trace built up, the cameras recorded the terrain\nunder the ship, and the two guardsmen built up their mosaic. The ship\ncrossed and re-crossed the continent, mapping as it went.\n\nFrom time to time, Lanko made careful comparison of the new mosaic with\nan earlier survey, noting differences. There were new settlements. Where\nmembers of a nomadic culture had roamed the prairie, an industrial\ncivilization was rapidly growing.\n\nLanko tapped on the map. \"Two cultures,\" he observed. \"Two cultures,\nseparated by mountains and desert. Absolutely no evidence of contact,\nbut considerable similarity between them. This pattern begins to look\nfamiliar.\"\n\nHe picked a tape from the shelves, ran it through a viewer, then\nreversed it, and picked out various portions for recheck. Finally, he\nmade a superposition of some of their observation tape, examined it, and\nturned. Banasel held up a hand.\n\n\"Don't tell us,\" he growled. \"I studied about drones, too.\"\n\n\"Drones?\" Musa looked at him, then glanced back at the viewer.\n\n\"Yes. Characters from one of the advanced cultures, who feel frustrated,\nand fail to fit in. They often turn into pleasure seekers, and\nfrequently end up by monkeying with primitive cultures, to prove their\nability to themselves, at least.\"\n\n\"Things like this happen often?\"\n\n\"Oh, not too often, I suppose, but often enough so that people like us\nare stationed on every known primitive planet, to prevent activity of\nthe type. You see, the drones usually start out simply, by setting up\nminor interference in business or government on some primitive planet.\nUsually, they're caught pretty quickly. But sometimes they evade\ncapture. And they can end up by exerting serious influence in cultural\npatterns. Some planets have been set back, and even destroyed as a\nresult of drone activity. Although their motives are different,\ndrones're just as bad and just as dangerous as any other criminal.\"\n\nLanko grinned a little. \"Only difference is, they're usually easier to\ncombat than organized criminal groups with a real purpose. Generally,\nthey're irresponsible youngsters who don't have the weapons,\norganization, or ability that the real criminals come up with.\" He\nshrugged.\n\n\"Of course,\" he added, \"we've called for help just in case. But we'll\nprobably be able to take care of this situation by ourselves. In fact,\nunless there are unusual features, we'd better, if we don't want to be\nregarded as somewhat ineffectual.\" He paused, glanced toward the\ndetector set, and tapped on the map again, then slowly traced out an\narea.\n\n\"We should be picking up something pretty soon,\" he said, thoughtfully.\n\"Better set up a pattern around here, in the mountain ranges, Banasel.\nWe can worry about settled areas later.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA needle flickered, rose from zero, then steadied.\n\nSomewhere, back of the instrument panel, a tiny current actuated a micro\nrelay, and an alarm drop fell.\n\nAs the warning buzz sounded, both Lanko and Banasel looked over at the\ndetector panel.\n\n\"Well, it's about time.\" Lanko leaned to his right, setting switches. A\nscreen lit up, showing a faint, red dot. He touched the controls,\nbringing the dot to center screen, then checked the meters.\n\n\"Not too far,\" he remarked. \"A little out of normal range, though. He\nmust have all his screen power on.\"\n\nBanasel turned back to the workbench, studied the labels on the drawers\nfor a moment, then opened one.\n\n\"Guess we'll need a can opener?\"\n\n\"We might. If he's aboard, we may have to get a little rough.\" Lanko\nleaned back.\n\n\"Check the power pattern. Sort of like to know what we're running into\nbefore we commit ourselves.\" He glanced again at the indicators, then\npoked at switches.\n\n\"In fact, I think we'd better wait right here, till we get this boy\nidentified.\"\n\nBanasel was whistling tunelessly as he set up readings on a computer.\nFinally, he poked the activator bar, and watched as the machine spat out\ntape. Above the tape chute, a series of graphs indicated the\ncomputations, but Banasel ignored them, feeding the tape into another\nmachine.\n\n\"I suppose there are some characters who could make a positive\nidentification from the figures and curves. But I'm just a beginner.\nThat's why they furnish integrator directories, I guess.\"\n\nLanko smiled. \"I don't know anything, either,\" he agreed. \"But I\ngenerally know where I can look up what I need.\" He set a compact reel\nof tape into the computer.\n\nThey watched the directory as its screens glowed. Figures and\ndescriptions shimmered, and there was a rapid ticking. A sheet flowed\nout toward them, and Banasel tore it off as the ticks ceased.\n\n\"Type seventeen screens,\" he read. \"Probably Ietorian model Nan\nfifty-seven generators. Strictly a sportster setup. He's got\nelectromagnetics and physical contact screens, but there's nothing else.\nAnd, with the type of readings I've got here, I'd say he's running all\nthe power he's got. Do we go in?\"\n\n\"Sure we do.\" Lanko nodded confidently as he slapped the drive lever.\n\n\"This thing we've got's only an atmosphere flier, but it's made to take\ncare of tougher stuff than luxury sportsters. Set up your can opener,\njust in case our boy wants to argue with us.\"\n\nBanasel nodded silently.\n\nThe small sportster was parked between two peaks. Before it was a tiny\nlevel space, too small for any ship. Above it, towered bare rock, tipped\nwith eternal snow. Lanko examined the scene disgustedly.\n\n\"Inhospitable, isn't he?\" he grunted. \"He could at least have had enough\nfront yard for a visitor to land.\" He picked up a microphone, touched a\nstud, and turned a knob. A faint hiss sounded from the speaker before\nhim.\n\n\"Philcor resident calling sportster,\" he snapped. \"Come in, Over.\"\n\nThe hiss continued. Lanko punched another stud, and listened. The hiss\nremained unchanged.\n\n\"Open him up, Banasel,\" he finally ordered. \"I'm going in.\"\n\nHe rose from his chair, crossing to the exit port. For an instant, he\nstood, checking his equipment belt. Then, he reached to a cabinet, to\npick up a tool kit. He opened the box, examined its contents, then\nturned and nodded to Banasel.\n\nThe port opened wide, and he stepped through.\n\nHe dropped lightly to the space before the sportster, then stepped away,\ncrouching behind a rock out-crop, and turned his body shield to full\npower.\n\n\"Screens down,\" he ordered.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA faint haze grew about the sportster. At first, it was a barely\nperceptible fluorescence. Then, it became a fiercely incandescent glow.\nIt flamed for a few seconds, then faded, becoming green, yellow, red,\nand at last, blinking to invisibility.\n\n\"They're damped,\" Banasel's voice announced. \"Shall I give him some more\nand knock out the generators?\"\n\n\"Not necessary,\" Lanko told him. \"Just hold complete neutralization.\nI'll cut them from inside.\"\n\nHe rose from his position behind the rock, idly kicking at the face of\nit as he walked past. A shower of dust crumbled to the ground.\n\n\"Good thing there aren't any trees around here,\" he laughed. \"We'd have\nto put out a forest fire.\"\n\nHe pulled his hand weapon from his belt, made a careful adjustment, then\nwalked over to the ship. After a quick examination, he directed the\nweapon toward a spot in the hull.\n\n\"Lot of credits here,\" he commented laconically. \"Shame to hurt the\nfinish too much.\"\n\nA few minutes later, he stepped back, examining his work. Then, he\nnodded and removed another instrument from his tool kit. He focused it\non the ship's port, flicked a switch on his belt, then snapped the\ninstrument on.\n\nFor a few seconds, nothing happened, then there was a grinding screech\nof tortured metal, and the port swung open.\n\nAs Lanko stepped inside, he examined the control room with care. At\nlast, satisfied that no booby traps were set, he crossed to the control\npanel. He located the communicator controls, and picked up the\nmicrophone.\n\n\"All's well, Ban,\" he reported. \"Ease off.\"\n\nHe watched as the overloaded generator recovered. When the needles were\nat normal readings, he flicked the screen controls off, then picked up\nthe microphone again.\n\n\"Haul out, Banasel,\" he ordered. \"I'm going to fix this can up again,\nclose the port, run up the screens, and wait for our boy to come home.\nLike to talk to him.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sportster had a well stocked galley. Lanko ate with enjoyment,\nstudying the tapes he had found interestedly. Finally, he pushed the\nlast reel aside, then sat back to gaze at the wall.\n\nA low tone sounded, and the viewscreen activated. Lanko nodded to\nhimself, then went to the control room aperture, turning off the alarm\nas he went through. A few strides took him to the entry port, where he\nwaited, weapon in hand.\n\nThe door swung open and Lanko touched his trigger. The newcomer's screen\nflared briefly, then collapsed. Lanko stepped forward, examining his\nprisoner.\n\nHe was humanoid. There were some differences from the usual type\nencountered on the planet, but they were not serious. He could have\npassed in most of the Galankar, if not anywhere. Some might even be\nattracted by his slightly unusual appearance. Lanko drew him into the\nship, and closed the port.\n\nHe took his time, making a complete search of the captive's clothing,\nand removing equipment and weapons. At last, he drew back, satisfied\nthat the being was harmless. He waited. It wouldn't be too long before\nthe business could begin.\n\nAs the paralysis effect wore off, the man on the floor flexed his\nmuscles, then got to his feet. Lanko watched him, his weapon resting on\nhis knees. As the man tensed to spring, Lanko raised the weapon a\nlittle.\n\n\"You are Genro Kir?\"\n\n\"Who are you? What's the idea?\" Kir reached for his belt, then dropped\nhis hand again as he found nothing there.\n\n\"Resident Guardsman. Name's Lanko. You seem to be a little out of place\non this planet.\"\n\n\"I'm not responsible to some native patrolman.\" Kir's face became\nstubborn. \"I'm a Galactic Citizen.\"\n\n\"Possibly. We'll leave that to the Sector authorities.\" Lanko shrugged,\nhis face expressionless. \"Meantime, you'll have to accept things as they\nare. Or would you rather be paralyzed again?\"\n\nGenro Kir tensed again, making an obvious mental effort.\n\nLanko grinned at him in real amusement. \"I took it. Wouldn't do you much\ngood anyway. They gave me heavy-duty equipment, you know.\" He waved\ntoward a chair with his weapon. \"Might as well sit down and talk about\nit. I've been through your tapes, of course.\"\n\nKir looked around unhappily, then sank into a chair. \"What's there to\ntalk about, then? You know what we were doing.\"\n\n\"In general, yes, we do. A good deal was on your tapes. But we need more\ndetail, and we've got to pick up your companions, you know. It would be\na lot better if we knew where they were.\"\n\n\"I don't know where they are myself. They're building up their forces,\nand working for position. This is just the opening, you see. The real\ngame won't start for quite a while.\"\n\nLanko laughed shortly. \"Frankly, I don't think it will start. But it\nwould make it simpler for all concerned if you'd help us find the\nplayers.\"\n\n\"I told you. I don't know where they are. They don't have to tell the\nreferee every move they make, unless they want a consultation as to\nlegality. I was just keeping watch on the general picture, to see that\nneither of them broke a rule, or took an unfair advantage.\"\n\n\"You may not know where they are,\" Lanko admitted, \"but you can\ncertainly contact them.\"\n\nGenro Kir smiled tightly. \"But I won't.\"\n\n\"They'll be hunted down, you know. We'll have them eventually. Be a lot\neasier for all concerned if you'd co\u00f6perate.\"\n\n\"Co\u00f6perate with a bunch of half savage natives, against my own friends?\nDon't be more stupid than you have to be!\"\n\n\"I see.\" Lanko glanced away. \"All very ethical, of course. Well, in that\ncase, we'll have to go to work.\" He pulled a fine chain from a case at\nhis belt, and walked over to his captive, weapon ready.\n\n\"Just hold still,\" he ordered. He slipped the delicate looking necklace\nover the man's head, squeezed the pendant, and jumped back.\n\n\"I don't know whether you're familiar with this device,\" he said, \"so\nI'll explain it to you. It's a type ninety-two gravitic manacle, and is\ndesigned to hold any known being. You can move about freely, so long as\nyou don't make any sudden or violent motion. The device is keyed to my\nshield, and you'll suffer temporary paralysis if you get within my near\nzone. You're safe enough a couple of meters from me.\" He walked back to\nthe control console.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" he added, \"don't try to take it off. It's designed to prevent\nthat action by positive means. It won't do you any permanent damage, but\nit can make you pretty uncomfortable. And, remember, if it becomes\nnecessary, I can activate the manacle. It'll put you into full paralysis\nand send out a strong homing signal.\"\n\nGenro Kir looked at him sourly. \"I won't try to escape,\" he promised.\n\n\"That's immaterial to me.\" Lanko flicked switches and the ship rose from\nthe ground, swung, and started westward. \"I was merely describing the\ncapabilities of the manacle.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the way over the sea, Lanko noted the positions of a few of the\ntrading ships, and approached them closely, examining them. As he\napproached a small archipelago, his communicator screen brightened.\n\n\"Resident Guardsman to Sportster. Identity yourself. Over.\"\n\nLanko picked up the microphone. \"It's all right, Ban. Got one. Two more\nto go.\"\n\n\"Fair enough. Come on in. I've got a beam on you.\"\n\nLanko checked the approach scope. The small circle was a trifle out of\ncenter. He touched the control bar, and as the circle centered, he\nsnapped a switch and sat back.\n\nThe sportster dipped over an island, crossed a narrow lagoon, and\nsettled to the ground beside the guard flier. Lanko started pulling\ntools from his kit. Working carefully, he removed the cover from the\ncontrol console, examined the terminal blocks, then attached a small\ncylinder between two terminals.\n\nHe closed the console again and walked over to the exit port, where he\npressed the emergency release. The port swung wide. For an instant, the\ncontrol console was blurred. Lanko waited, then as the panel returned to\nfocus, he walked back to it. He snapped the drive switch on and pushed\nthe drive to maximum. Nothing happened. He punched the emergency power\nbutton, and waited an instant. There was no result. He nodded to his\nprisoner.\n\n\"Come on, Genro Kir. We may want you to talk to someone.\" He pointed to\nthe port. Kir hesitated, then went through. He managed a sneer as he did\nso.\n\nThe port of the flier opened, and Banasel looked out. \"Need any help?\"\n\n\"No. This spaceship won't fly till someone from Sector comes out to pull\nthe block.\" Lanko pointed. \"This is Genro Kir. He was refereeing a sort\nof battle game between a couple of his companions.\"\n\nLanko herded Kir in front of him, and entered his own flier. He placed\nthe equipment kit on a shelf, and sat down. Banasel perched on his\nworkbench.\n\n\"What kind of a setup did these jokers have?\"\n\n\"Well, you can review the tapes later and get a few of the details, but\nhere's the general idea:\n\n\"Genro Kir and his two companions made planetfall some years back. They\ndidn't know it was a discovered planet, and failed to note any evidence\nof our presence. Somehow, we missed them, too, for which we should hang\nour heads.\n\n\"Anyway, they checked the planet, found it was suitable to their\npurpose, and decided that Koree Buron and Sira Nal could use it as a\nplaying board. Seems they had a bet on, and their last game was\ninconclusive. Both of the involved civilizations collapsed.\n\n\"Each of them selected a portion of the habitable part of the eastern\ncontinent as a primary base. Buron took the east, and that left the west\nto Nal. It so happens that the central portion of the continent is\ndifficult to pass, and that fitted in with their plans. You remember the\ndesert and mountain ranges, of course? Well, so far as I can discover,\nthere was virtually no contact before the arrival of these three prizes\nof ours. And after their arrival, they made sure that there would be no\ncontact--not until they wanted it.\n\n\"Of course, deserts can be crossed, and mountains can be climbed, but\nour three boys fixed it so it would be fatal for any native to try it.\nThen, each of the two contestants set to work to build up the war\npotential of his part of the continent.\n\n\"In the meantime, Genro was acting as referee. He's been checking the\nprogress of the two contestants, and making sure that neither of them\nsneaks into the territory of the other to upset something, or commits\nany other breach of rules.\"\n\nBanasel slid off his bench. \"Atmosphere of mutual trust, I see.\"\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\n\"Where do the Kondaran priests come in?\"\n\n\"Oh, those two aren't going to confine the final stage of their game to\nthe one continent. That's just the starting point--the home base. And\nwhat they're doing now is just the opening of the game. The end game\nwill decide control of the entire planet. Sira Nal's just getting off to\nan early start, that's all.\"\n\n\"This is legitimate, according to their rules?\"\n\n\"I guess so. According to Kir's tapes, he thinks it's a clever maneuver.\n'Sound move' is the way he expressed it.\" Lanko stood and walked over to\nthe reproducer set. \"That all came from the tapes, of course.\"\n\n\"How much more has Kir told you?\"\n\n\"As little as possible.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBanasel looked toward the prisoner. \"Why not co\u00f6perate? You're due for\nAldebaran anyway. And a little help now would make it easier for you and\nyour partners later.\"\n\nGenro Kir's lip curled. \"As I told your friend, I don't have to lower\nmyself to work with a bunch of low-grade primitives.\"\n\n\"See what I mean?\" Lanko slanted an eyebrow at Banasel. \"But I think our\nfriend here will help us some, anyway. That 'sound move' he recorded is\nalmost sure to catch us one of the players.\"\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\n\"Sure. What's the whole foundation of this cult of Kondaro?\"\n\n\"Why, they navigate ships. They keep strict security on their methods.\nThey enforce that security by terrorism. They claim that no one else can\nsuccessfully cross the Great Sea, and it seems to be a proven fact that\nthey're right. So, they collect from seamen, traders, and shipowners.\"\n\n\"That's right. And they claim that only they can overcome the spells and\nactions of the sea demons, which try to destroy any ship that sails the\nsea. First, though, they navigate ships. They guarantee to get 'em\nacross the sea and back. Right?\"\n\nBanasel nodded.\n\n\"Suppose they start losing ships? Suppose that from now on, no ship\nreturns to port?\" Lanko walked over to the control console.\n\n\"Hey, wait a minute. I know these priests are a bunch of pirates--or\nsome of them are, at any rate. But we can't--\"\n\n\"Who said anything about destroying life?\" Lanko spread his hands. \"We\nhave here a fairly nice group of islands,\" he pointed out. \"Not too\nspacious, of course, and not possessed of any luxurious cities. But\nthere's water, and fresh fruits are available in plenty. The ships are\nprovisioned fairly well, but they generally put in here for those very\nfruits. So, all we need do is give a little unwanted help.\"\n\n\"Shipwreck?\"\n\n\"Something like that.\"\n\nBanasel shook his head doubtfully. \"It'll take a long time to undermine\ntheir reputation that way,\" he objected. \"And we'd have a lot of people\non these islands before we were through.\"\n\n\"I don't think so. Kondaro's a god, remember? And gods are infallible.\nSira Nal can explain a few disappearances by accusations of irreverence,\nbut he'll know better than to try explaining too many that way. I should\nimagine that the normal losses due to unexpected storms just about use\nup his allotment along that line.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nLanko shook his head. \"No, Sira Nal's going to have to do something to\nprevent any rumor to the effect that the sea god is losing his grip.\" He\npaused. \"And what ship do you think I spotted standing this way?\"\n\n\"Oh, no! That's too much of a coincidence.\"\n\n\"No, not really. We took considerable time gathering in our boy here.\"\nLanko inclined his head toward Genro Kir. \"And the _Bordeklu's_ home\nport is Tanagor, so Musa's old ship wouldn't spend too much of a layover\nin Kneuros. They're on schedule all right. You'd like to see your old\nfriend, Dontor, again, wouldn't you, Musa? Sort of watch him try to save\nhis ship in a real emergency?\"\n\nMusa grinned wolfishly. \"Might be fun, at that,\" he agreed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDontor strode firmly toward the ladder leading to the observation deck.\nThe slaves had rigged the screen, and the priest looked proudly about\nthis ship of which he was the actual and absolute master. Slowly, in\nmajestic silence, he mounted the ladder and passed through the opening\nin the curtain.\n\nHe went to the middle of the forecastle, and stopped, waiting until the\ntwo junior priests had taken their positions near him and the slaves had\nset down the equipment chests. The slaves straightened, and stood, arms\nfolded, waiting. Dontor inspected the area, then moved his head\nimperiously.\n\n\"Very good,\" he said. \"Take your posts.\"\n\nAs the slaves left, the three priests opened their instrument chests,\nremoving navigational tools. Alnar went to the folding table, spread the\nchart over it, then took his watch out of the chest and stood back,\nholding it.\n\n\"Just about time, sir.\"\n\n\"Very well.\" Dontor glanced at the juniors, saw that Kuero had his\nsextant ready, and raised his own.\n\n\"Now,\" he instructed, when the readings were complete, \"you will each\ncalculate our position independently. I'll check your work when you have\nfinished.\" He replaced his sextant in its case, then headed the small\nprocession back to the cabins.\n\nThe ship's routine continued its uneventful course. The junior priests\nreported to Dontor with their calculations. Their work was examined,\ncriticized, and finally approved. They were given further instructions.\nAll was well aboard the _Bordeklu_.\n\nThe chief priest examined the charts and decided on the course for the\nnext watch. The ship, he thought, would have to put in for water. And\nsome of the island fruits would go well on the table. He set a course\naccordingly, and went topside to give instructions to the pilot.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_\"Are you going to help them on their way?\"_\n\n_\"It's not necessary, unless they start to by-pass the island. They'll\nhave plenty to worry about when they try to anchor.\"_\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAhead of the ship, the sea was calm. No cloud marred the bright blue\noverhead. Slowly, a vague shape formed on the horizon, then it grew, to\nbecome a small, wooded island.\n\nThe ship continued on its course, approaching the bit of land, and\nneared the breaker line. Orders sounded sharply, and the sails\ncollapsed, spilling their wind. A crew forward cut the snubbing line,\nand the bow anchor splashed into the water.\n\nThe ship continued, and the anchor cable became taut. In defiance of the\nhelmsman's efforts, the ship continued on a straight course. The bow\nline stretched, then loosened a little, as the anchor dragged. Still,\nthe ship refused to swing. Hurriedly, the crew aft dropped the stern\nanchor. But the ship persisted on its course. All hands forward took\nshelter as the bow cable snapped and whipped viciously across the deck.\nThe ship maintained its slow progress.\n\nFrantically, the crew backed the sails, hoisting them to take all the\nwind possible. The helmsman spun the wheel in a final effort to turn the\nship back to sea, then cast a glance astern at the taut cable, and\nducked for shelter.\n\nSea anchors were hastily thrown overside, but still the ship approached\nthe beach. The keel grated on sand, and the ship continued to move\nforward, as though, tired of the sea, it had decided to return to the\nforest. At last, wedged among the trees, the vessel stopped, far above\nthe sands of the beach.\n\nIt was obviously there to stay.\n\nDontor stood, looking seaward. He shook his head, looked forward, then\ndown at the ground beneath the ship. This was outside his experience. It\nwas also outside the teaching so carefully instilled in his mind in the\nclassrooms back at Tanagor, and later during those long days and nights\nwhen he was a junior priest. He had been taught to speak of sea demons,\nand to explain their actions, but he had not been told to believe in\nthem.\n\nHe wondered if the great Kondaro really existed, and if he did, just\nwhat he might think of Dontor and of the ship he had so recently\ncontrolled. The thought crossed his mind that a real god might be\nsomewhat critical of the priesthood of the sea.\n\n\"Something,\" he mused aloud, \"will have to be done to prevent loss of\nfaith.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_\"Well,\" remarked Lanko as he snapped the tractor off. \"That's the first\nhandful of sand for the cook pot.\"_\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSira Nal drummed impatiently on the table before him.\n\n\"I thought you could handle routine operations,\" he said bitingly. \"Now,\nyou tell me you've been missing ship after ship. What happened to them?\"\n\nThe high priest shook his head. \"We haven't been able to find out, sir.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me you haven't anything to report on them?\"\n\n\"We have sent out investigating ships, sir.\"\n\n\"And?\"\n\n\"They haven't reported back, sir.\"\n\nSira Nal's checks paled slightly with rage as he stared at his\nunderling.\n\n\"Miron,\" he snapped, \"I'm not going to tell you exactly what to do, or\nhow. You're supposed to know how to treat emergencies, not to call me\nany time something outside of routine happens. I want a report on those\nships tomorrow morning.\" He glanced out of the window. \"I don't care how\nyou do it, but find out what happened, and I don't ever want to hear you\nadmit again that you can't account for any ship I ask about. Is that\nclear?\"\n\nMiron nodded unhappily. \"Yes, sir.\" He bowed and backed out of the room.\n\nHe forced himself to suppress his anger as he gently closed the door.\nThen, he stood for a moment, fists clenched, as he directed a furious\ngaze at the panels.\n\n\"How?\" he thought. \"How does he expect me to know what's going on at sea\nunless ships come in to give me information, or I am able to go out\npersonally. And how does he expect me to make a personal check in one\nnight?\"\n\nHe started walking along the corridor. \"I have no supernatural powers,\nand he knows it. He's the prophet. Wish I'd never--\"\n\nHe looked at the walls around him, then shook his head. No use thinking\nof that. None had ever successfully left the service of Kondaro. He\ncontinued to a stair, mounted it, then climbed ladders, to finally come\nout at the observation platform atop the temple. The observer bowed as\nhis superior entered the little room just below the torch.\n\n\"Have there been any arrivals?\"\n\n\"None, sir. I've seen no sails.\"\n\n\"I am going to send you an acolyte. If you see anything, send him to me\nimmediately.\" Miron turned to go back to his quarters.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter Miron's departure, Sira Nal sat for a time, still staring at the\nclosed door. He had caught the wave of frustrated rage, and had almost\nresponded for a second. But, he was forced to admit, the priest had\njustification. He had organized his forces adequately--had been a useful\npiece, within his limitations.\n\n\"I wonder,\" mused Sira Nal, \"if Buron's pulling a sneak punch.\" He\ntilted his head. \"It would be a little foul, but he might try something\nlike that.\" He reviewed the rules they had agreed upon.\n\nAfter all, this phase of his operation was outside of the home zone, and\nhe was actually vulnerable to attack, even this early. He had assumed\nthat Buron would be too busy developing his own pieces to spend any time\non an offensive move at this stage. Of course, direct intervention was a\nlittle unethical, but Buron might try it.\n\nHe had thought his opponent would be too occupied to notice a move at\nthis remote part of the board. And he had established this advance base\nby direct intervention, too. If Buron had noticed, and if he had checked\nNal's methods, he might have felt justified, and have taken time for a\nquick, disruptive move. And Sira Nal was forced to admit that such a\nmove might be allowed by Kir. It might be even approved, and hailed as a\nbrilliant counter.\n\nHe rose to his feet, pacing about the room. If this were a move by\nBuron, the priesthood would be powerless to counter. It would take\ndirect action by the player, of course. He grumbled to himself.\n\n\"Can't let this development be wasted. I'd lose too much time. I'll have\nto check personally.\"\n\nHe crossed to the window, opened it, and stepped out on the balcony.\n\nOutside, the sun glinted on the harbor. A ship was standing out to sea,\nsails set to pick up the breeze from the headland. Sira Nal looked over\ntoward the shipyards. It was a well organized secondary base, and it\nwould probably develop into a highly valuable position. Somehow, he\ndoubted that Buron would have been able to do as well, considering the\ntime factor. He shook his head. This must be retained.\n\nHe threw the robe back, checked his equipment belt, adjusted his body\nshield, and stepped off the balcony, activating his levitation\nmodulator. He swung around the outgoing ship, noting the activity aboard\nwith approval, then headed seaward, to follow the route he had\nprescribed for his navigators. Somewhere out there, he would undoubtedly\nfind Buron, poised to strike at any ship which bore the red and gold of\nKondaro.\n\nAnd when he did find him, he knew, he would have to outline a counter\nmove which would force immunity to his sea lanes. He considered the\npossibilities as he sped over the sea.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMusa sat before the detector, idly watching the vague patterns that grew\nand collapsed on the viewscreen. The scanner, Lanko had explained,\npicked up ghost images from heated air masses, or from clouds, but it\ndiscriminated against them, refusing to form a definite image unless a\nmaterial body came within range. Then, it indicated range and azimuth,\nchecked the body against the predetermined data, and the selective\nmagnification circuits cut in.\n\nAs Musa watched, a sea bird appeared on the screen, outlined sharply\nagainst the darkness of the sea. The viewscreen tracked it for an\ninstant, then continued its scan. Another body showed, seeming to come\nfrom under the sea. Musa looked at it curiously, then noticed that the\nrange marks had tripped on. The screen was holding the object at center.\nA slight glow appeared, obscuring visual detail, and more marks showed\nin the legend. Musa turned around.\n\n\"Banasel,\" he called, \"what's this?\"\n\nBanasel was engaged in his usual pastime of tinkering with the\nequipment. He looked around, then walked quickly over to the screen, to\nmake adjustments. The object came into sharp focus, revealing itself as\na man in the robes of Kondaro. Range and azimuth lines became clearly\ndefined, and a graph showed in the legend space. Banasel glanced down at\nthe dials.\n\n\"Hey, Lanko,\" he called, \"we've got a customer.\"\n\n\"Where?\" Lanko came out of the mess compartment.\n\n\"About seventy-one, true, and coming in fast. Range, about a hundred\nK's.\" Banasel twisted dials, watching the result on the screen. \"Looks\nas though our friend's coming in for a conference.\"\n\n\"Screens?\"\n\n\"Personal body shield. Probably a Morei twelve. Nothing special.\"\n\nLanko got into the gunner's chair and punched a button. The sight screen\nlit, showing the approaching body clearly. He turned a knob, increasing\nmagnification.\n\n\"All dressed up in his ceremonial robes, too,\" he laughed. \"This kid\ncould have done well as a clothing designer.\"\n\nHe adjusted a few knobs, examining a meter. Then, he reached for the\nweapon's grip.\n\n\"No point in discussing matters with him now. He can talk after we get\nhim in, and he's just about in range now.\" He brought the hair-lines on\nthe viewscreen to center on the approaching figure, and squeezed the\ngrip.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSira Nal felt the sudden pressure. Annoyed, he reached to his belt, to\nturn his shield to full power. This was highly unethical. Buron should\ncertainly know better than to resort to personal attack. Such action\ncould be protested, and Sira Nal could demand concessions.\n\nHe looked ahead, searchingly. The horizon ahead was broken by a faint\ncloud, which indicated the islands, but there was no evidence of his\nopponent. He shook his head, and started to rise, but his shield was\nfailing. Suddenly, he became aware of the overheating generator pack.\nSomething was decidedly wrong. He reached for his own hand weapon, still\nsearching for his attacker. At last, he noticed a slight shimmer, dead\nahead. He pointed the weapon.\n\n\"Now, now,\" cautioned a voice, \"you could get hurt that way. Close down\nyour shield and relax. This is a guard flier. You're in arrest tractor.\"\n\nSira Nal recognized that the tractor was pulling him ahead. His\ngenerator pack was heating up dangerously.\n\nHe was being captured!\n\nFuriously, he thought of the attacks he had made in similar manner, in\nthis same area. He still could remember the horrified expression on one\nshipowner's face just before his ship broke to bits under him.\n\nThey wouldn't get him, though.\n\nThey couldn't.\n\nHe would blast them out of his path. Just as he had blasted the\npresumptuous natives who opposed him.\n\nThumbing the hand weapon to full blast, he centered it on the faint\nshimmer ahead, and squeezed the trigger.\n\nLet the meddlers look out for themselves.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBanasel winced a little as the fireball spread, then rose skyward, to\nform a large cloud.\n\n\"You could have relaxed,\" he protested. \"The blast wouldn't have jolted\nour screen too much, and you could have gotten him again.\"\n\n\"I know.\" Lanko flicked off the gunnery switches and leaned back,\nrubbing his head. \"There was a possibility, and I fully intended to\nrelax. But the decision time was short, and frankly, those thoughts of\nhis overrode me for just too long. That boy was dangerous!\"\n\nHe turned to Genro Kir, who was looking with horrified fascination at\nthe still growing cloud in the screen.\n\n\"It's unfortunate. We'll try to get your other partner alive.\"\n\n\"You destroyed him!\" Kir looked a little sick.\n\n\"No. We didn't destroy him. He should have known better than to fire\ninto a tractor. I'll have to admit, I did slip a little. I assumed he\nwas the usual type of drone. I didn't recognize the full extent of his\naberration.\"\n\nLanko got out of his chair, and crossed the room, to confront the\nprisoner.\n\n\"Look, Kir. I don't know whether your other partner's like that one or\nnot. But I think it's about time you helped a little. If you had given\nus clues to Sira Nal's personality and probable location, we might have\nbeen able to take precautions. He might be with us now. Or, do you enjoy\nseeing your friends turn themselves into flaming clouds of smoke?\"\n\n\"You mean I ... I'm responsible ... for that?\"\n\n\"Partially. You helped them. You refused any assistance in their\ncapture. And you knew they were going to be captured, one way or\nanother.\"\n\nKir directed a horrified look at the screen.\n\n\"What can I do?\"\n\n\"Get in contact with Koree Buron. Tell him what happened here. Tell him,\ntoo, that we're looking for him, and that there is a Sector Guardsman\ndue to join us within a few hours. Explain to him that there will be\ndirection-finders on him very soon, and that any effort he may make to\nuse his body shield, his weapons, or even his thought-radiations, will\nbe noted, and will lead to him.\n\n\"Once you establish contact, we will ride in, if you wish. And we can\nassure him that he'll be either hunted down promptly, or he will have to\nassume and accept the role of a native--and a very inconspicuous,\nuninfluential native, at that.\n\n\"Tell him that he is free to come to us and surrender at any time within\nthe next twenty hours, planetary. After that, he will be taken by the\nmost expedient means. After the surrender deadline, you can assure him\nthat his life will be of less importance to us, and to the Sector\nGuardsman, than that of the most humble native.\n\n\"Here's your mental amplifier, if you need it.\"\n\nGenro Kir looked at the proffered circlet, then slowly extended a hand.\nHe took the device, turned it around in his hands for a few moments,\nthen put it on.\n\nSuddenly, his face set in decision, and he sat quietly for a while, grim\nfaced. At last, he looked up.\n\n\"I got him. He argued a little, but he had a poor argument, and he knew\nit. He'll be here within an hour, screens down.\"\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\nThis etext was produced from _Astounding Science Fiction_ April 1955.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright\non this publication was renewed.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
