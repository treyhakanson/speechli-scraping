Now, if\nthis postulate be granted, it follows that a dweller in this State would\nbe freed from those conditions of Time and Space which bind those beings\nwho are confined within the limits of Tri-Dimensional Space, or\nExistence. For example, he would be able to make himself visible or\ninvisible to us at will by entering into or withdrawing himself from\nthis State, and returning into that of Four Dimensions, whither our eyes\ncould not follow him--even though he might be close to us in our sense\nof nearness. Moreover, he could be in two or more places at once, and\ncause two bodies to occupy the same space--which to us is\ninconceivable. Stranger still, he might be both alive and dead at the\nsame time--since Past, Present, and Future would be all one to him; the\nworld without beginning or end ...--From the \"Geometrical\nPossibilities,\" of Abd'el Kasir, of Cordoba, circa. 1050 A.D.\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n\n    CHAP.

Just fancy!--the poor thing--dead\nhow many years? Something like five thousand, isn't it? And doesn't she\nlook just like me! I mean, wouldn't she, if we had both been dead as\nlong?\"\n\nAs she said this, Miss Nitocris Marmion, the golden-haired, black-eyed\ndaughter of one of the most celebrated mathematicians and physicists in\nEurope, stood herself up beside the mummy-case which her father had\nreceived that morning from Memphis.\n\n\"Look!\" she continued. \"I am almost the same height. Just a little\ntaller, perhaps, but you see her hair is nearly as fair as mine. Of\ncourse, you don't know what colour her eyes are--just fancy, Dad! they\nhave been shut for nearly five thousand years, perhaps a little\nmore--because I think they counted by dynasties then--and yet look at\nthe features! Just imagine me dead!\"\n\n\"Just imagine yourself shutting the door on the other side, my dear\nNiti,\" said the Professor, who had risen from the chair, and was facing\nhis daughter and the Mummy. \"I don't want to banish you too\nunceremoniously, but I really have a lot of work to do to-night, and, as\nyou might know, Bachelor of Science of London as you are, I have got to\nworry out as best I can, if I can do it at all, this problem that\nHartley sent me about the Forty-seventh Proposition of the first book of\nEuclid.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" she said, going to his side and putting her hand on to his\nshoulder as he stood facing the Mummy; \"I have reason enough to remember\nthat. And what does Professor Hartley say about it?\"\n\n\"He says, my dear Niti,\" said the Professor, in a voice which had\nsomething like a note of awe in it, \"that when Pythagoras thought out\nthat problem--which, of course, is not Euclid's at all--he almost saw\nacross the horizon of the world that we live in.\"\n\n\"But that,\" she interrupted, \"would be something like looking across the\nedge of time into eternity, and that--well, of course, that is quite\nimpossible, even to you, Dad, or Mr Hartley. What does he mean?\"\n\n\"He doesn't quite mean that, dear,\" replied the Professor, still staring\nstraight at the motionless Mummy as though he half expected the lips\nwhich had not spoken for fifty centuries to answer the question that was\nshaping itself in his mind. \"What Hartley means, dear, is this--that\nwhen Pythagoras thought out that proposition he had almost reached the\nborder which divides the world of three dimensions from the world of\nfour.\"\n\n\"Which, as our dear old friend Euclid would say, is impossible; because\nyou know, Dad, if that were possible, everything else would be. Come,\nnow, Annie is bringing up your whisky and soda. Put away your problems\nand take your night-cap, and do get to bed in something like respectable\ntime. Don't worry your dear old head about forty-seventh propositions\nand fourth dimensions and mummies and that sort of thing, even if this\nMummy does happen to look a bit like me. Now, good night, and remember\nthat the night-cap _is_ to be a night-cap, and when you've put it on you\nreally must go to bed. You've been thinking a great deal too much this\nweek. Good-night, Dad.\"\n\n\"Good-night, Niti, dear. Don't trouble your head about my thinking.\nSufficient unto the brain are the thoughts thereof. Sometimes they are\nmore than sufficient. Good-night. Sleep well and don't dream, if you can\nhelp it.\"\n\n\"And don't _you_ dream, Dad, especially about that wretched proposition.\nJust have another pipe, and drink your whisky and go to bed. There's\nsomething in your eyes that says you want a long night's rest.\nGood-night now, and sleep well.\"\n\nShe pulled his head down and kissed him twice on his grey, thin cheek,\nand then, with a wave of her hand and a laughing nod towards the Mummy,\nvanished through the closing study door to go and dream her dreams,\nwhich were not very likely to be of mummies and fourth dimensional\nproblems, and left her father to dream his.\n\nThen a couple of lines from one of \"B.V.'s\" poems, which had been\nrunning in his head all the evening, came back to him, and he murmured\nhalf-unconsciously:\n\n  \"'Was it hundreds of years ago, my love,\n  Was it thousands of miles away...?'\"\n\n\"And why should it not be? Why should you, who were once Ma-Rim[=o]n,\npriest of Amen-Ra, in the City of Memphis--you who almost stood upon the\nthreshold of the Inmost Sanctuary of Knowledge: you who, if your\nfootsteps had not turned aside into the way of temptation and trodden\nthe black path of Sin, might even now be dwelling on the Shores of\nEverlasting Peace in the Land of Amenti--dost _thou_ dare to ask such a\nquestion?\"\n\nThe sudden change of the pronoun seemed to him to put the Clock of Time\nback indefinitely.\n\nHe was standing by his desk still facing the Mummy just as his daughter\nhad left him after saying \"good-night.\" He was not a man to be easily\nastonished. Not only was he one of the best-read amateur Egyptologists\nin Europe, but he was also an ex-President of the Royal Society, a\nMember of the Psychical Research Society, and, moreover, Chairman of a\nrecently appointed Commission on Comparative Insanity, the object of\nwhose labours was to determine, if possible, what proportion of people\noutside asylums were mad or sane according to a standard which, somehow,\nno one had thought of inventing before--the standard of common-sense.\n\nThe voice, strangely like his daughter's and his dead wife's also,\nappeared to come from nowhere and yet from everywhere, and it had a\nfaint and far-away echo in it which harmonised most marvellously with\nother echoes which seemed to come up out of the depths of his own soul.\n\nWhere had he heard it before? Somewhere, certainly. There was no\npossibility of mistaking tones which were so irresistibly familiar, and,\nmoreover, why did they bring back to him such distinct memories of\ntragedies long forgotten, even by him? Why did they instantly draw\nbefore the windows of his soul a long panorama of vast cities, splendid\npalaces, sombre temples, and towering tombs, in which he saw all these\nand more with an infinitely greater vividness of form and light and\ncolour than he had ever been able to do in his most inspired hours of\ndream or study?\n\nHad the voice really come from those long-silenced lips of the Mummy of\nNitocris, that daughter of the Pharaohs who had so terribly avenged her\noutraged love, and after whom he had named the only child of his\nmarriage?\n\n\"It is certainly very strange,\" he said, going to his writing-table and\ntaking up his pipe. \"I know that voice, or at least I seem to know it,\nand it is very like Niti's and her mother's; but where can it have come\nfrom? Hardly from your lips, my long-dead Royal Egypt,\" he went on,\ngoing up to the mummy-case and peering through his spectacles into the\nrigid features. He put up his hand and tapped the tightly-drawn lips\nvery gently, then turned away with a smile, saying aloud to himself:\n\"No, no, I must have been allowing what they call my scientific\nimagination to play tricks with me. Perhaps I have been worrying a\nlittle too much about this confounded fourth dimension problem,--and yet\nthe thing is exceedingly fascinating. If the hand of Science could only\nreach across the frontier line! If we could only see out of the world of\nlength and breadth and thickness into that other world of these and\nsomething else, how many puzzles would be solved, how many\nimpossibilities would become possible, and how many of the miracles\nwhich those old Egyptian adepts so seriously claimed to work would look\nlike the merest commonplaces! Ah well, now for the realities. I suppose\nthat's Annie with the whisky.\"\n\nAs he turned round the door opened, and he beheld a very strange sight,\none which, to a man who had had a less stern mental training than he had\nhad, would have been nothing less than terrifying. His daughter came in\nwith a little silver tray on which there was a small decanter of whisky,\na glass, and a syphon of soda-water.\n\n\"Annie has gone to the post, and I thought I might as well bring this\nmyself,\" said Miss Nitocris, walking to the table and putting the tray\ndown on the corner of it.\n\nBeside her stood another figure as familiar now to his eyes as her's\nwas, dressed and tired and jewelled in a fashion equally familiar. Save\nfor the difference in dress, Nitocris, the daughter of Rameses, was the\nexact counterpart in feature, stature, and colouring of Nitocris, the\ndaughter of Professor Marmion. In her hands she carried a slender,\nlong-necked jar of brilliantly enamelled earthenware and a golden flagon\nrichly chased, and glittering with jewels, and these she put down on the\ntable in exactly the same place as the other Nitocris had put her tray\non, and as she did so he heard the voice again, saying:\n\n\"Time was, is now, and ever shall be to those for whom Time has ceased\nto be--which is a riddle that Ma-Rim[=o]n may even now learn, since his\nsoul has been purified and his spirit strengthened by earnest devotion\nthrough many lives to the search for the True Knowledge.\"\n\nBoth voices had spoken together, the one in English and the other in the\nancient tongue of Khem, yet he had heard each syllable separately and\ncomprehended both utterances perfectly. He felt a cold grip of fear at\nhis heart as he looked towards the mummy-case, and, as his fear had\nwarned him, it was empty. Then he looked at his daughter, and as their\neyes met, she said in the most commonplace tones:\n\n\"My dear Dad, what _is_ the matter with you? If advanced people like\nourselves believed in any such nonsense, I should be inclined to say\nthat you had seen a ghost; but I suppose it's only that silly fourth\ndimension puzzle that's worrying you. Now, look here, you must really\ntake your whisky and go to bed. If you go on bothering any longer about\n'N to the fourth,' you will have one of your bad headaches to-morrow and\nwon't be able to finish your address for the Institute.\"\n\nShe put her hand out and took up the decanter. It passed without any\napparent resistance through the jar. She lifted it from the same place,\nand poured out the usual modicum of whisky into the glass, which was\nstanding just where the flagon was. Then she pressed the trigger of the\nsyphon, and the familiar hiss of the soda-water brought the Professor,\nas he thought, back to his senses.\n\nBut no! There could be no doubt about it. There in material form on the\ncorner of his table was a point-blank, tangible contradiction of the\nuniversally accepted axiom that two bodies cannot occupy the same space,\nand that, come from somewhere or nowhere, there were two plainly\nmaterial objects through which his daughter's hand, without her even\nknowing it, had passed as easily as it would have done through a little\ncloud of steam. Happily she had no idea of what he had seen and heard,\nand so for her sake he made a strong effort to control himself, and said\nas steadily as he could:\n\n\"Thank you, Niti, it is very good of you. Yes, I think I am a little\ntired to-night. Good-night now, and I promise you that I will be off\nvery soon; I will just have one more pipe, and drink my whisky, and then\nI really will go. Good-night, little woman. We'll have a talk about the\nMummy in the morning.\"\n\nAs soon as his daughter had closed the door, Professor Marmion returned\nto his writing-table. The decanter of whisky, the tumbler, and the\nsyphon of soda-water were still standing on the corner of the table,\noccupying the same space as the enamelled flagon of wine and the\ndrinking goblet which the long-dead other-self of Miss Nitocris had\nplaced on the little silver salver.\n\nHe looked about the room anxiously, with a feeling nearer akin to\nphysical dread than he had ever experienced before; but his worst fears\nwere not fulfilled. Nitocris the Queen had vanished and the Mummy was\nback in its case, blind, rigid, and silent, as it had been for fifty\ncenturies.\n\nFor several moments he looked at the hard, grey, fixed features of the\nwoman who had once been Nitocris, Queen of Middle Egypt, half expecting,\nafter what he had seen, or thought he had seen, that the soul would\nreturn, that the long-closed eyes would open again, and that the\nlong-silent lips would speak to him. But no! For all the answer that he\ngot he might as well have been looking upon the granite features of the\nSphinx itself. He turned away again towards the table, and murmured:\n\n\"Ah well! I suppose it was only an hallucination, after all. One of\nthese strange pranks that the over-strained intellect sometimes plays\nwith us. Perhaps I have been thinking too much lately. And now I really\nthink I had better follow Niti's advice, and take my night-cap and go to\nbed.\"\n\nBut as he put out his hand to take the whisky decanter he stopped and\npulled it back.\n\n\"What on earth is the matter with me?\" he said, putting his hand to his\nhead. \"That decanter is mine--it is the same, and yet it is standing in\njust the same place as that other thing--and I remember that, too. Look\nhere, Franklin Marmion, my friend, if you were not a rather over-worked\nman I should think you had had a good deal too much to drink. Two bodies\n_cannot_ occupy the same space. It is ridiculous, impossible!\"\n\nAs he said the last word, his voice rose a little, and, as it seemed, an\necho came back from one of the corners of the room:\n\n\"Impossible, impossible?\"\n\nThere seemed to be a sarcastic note of interrogation after the last\nword.\n\n\"Eh? What was that?\" and he looked round at the mummy-case. Her\nlong-dead Majesty was still reclining in it, silent and impassive.\n\n\"Oh, this won't do at all! Hartley and the fourth dimension be hanged!\nIt strikes me that this way madness lies if you only go far enough. I'll\nhave that night-cap at once and go to bed.\"\n\nHe put out his hand, took hold of the whisky decanter, and as he drew\nback his arm he saw that instead he held the enamelled flagon in his\ngrasp.\n\n\"Well, well,\" he said, looking at it half-angrily, \"if it is to be, it\nmust be.\"\n\nHe put out his left hand and took hold of the goblet, tilted the flagon,\nand out of the curved lip there fell a thin stream of wine, which\nglittered with a pale ruby radiance in the light of the electric cluster\nthat hung above his writing-desk. He set the flagon down, and as he\nraised the goblet to his lips, he heard his own voice saying in the\nancient language of Khem:\n\n\"As was, and is, and ever shall be; ever, yet never--never, yet ever.\nNitocris the Queen, in the name of Nebzec I greet thee! From thy hands I\ntake the gift of the Perfect Knowledge!\"\n\nAs he drained the goblet he turned towards the mummy-case. It might have\nbeen fancy, it might have been the effect of that miraculous old wine of\nCos which, if he had really drunk it, must now be more than thirty\ncenturies old: it might have been the result of the hard thinking that\nhe had been doing now for several days and half-nights; but he certainly\nthought that the Queen's head suddenly became endowed with life, that\nthe eyes opened, and the grey of the parchment skin softened into a\ndelicate olive tinge with a faint rosy blush showing through it. The\nbrown, shrivelled lips seemed to fill out, grow red, and smile. The\neyelids lifted, and the eyes of the Nitocris of old looked down on him\nfor a moment. He shook his head and looked, and there was the Mummy just\nas it had been when he opened the case.\n\n\"Really, this is strange, almost to the point of bewilderment,\" he went\non. \"I wonder if there is any more of that wine left?\"\n\nHe took up the flagon and poured out another goblet, filled and drank\nit.\n\n\"Yes,\" he continued, speaking as though under some strange exultation of\nthe mind rather than of the senses, \"yes, that is the wine of Cos. I\ndrank it. I, Ma-Rim[=o]n, the priest-student of the Higher Mysteries; I,\nwhose feet faltered on the threshold of the Place of the Elect, and\nwhose heart failed him at the portal of the Sanctuary, even though\nAmen-Ra was beckoning me to cross it.\"\n\n\"Good heavens, what nonsense I am talking! Whatever there was in that\nwine or wherever it came from, I think it is quite time I was off, not\nto old Egypt, but the Land of Nod. It seems to--no, it has not got into\nmy head; in fact I am beginning to see that, after all, Hartley might\nvery possibly be right about that forty-seventh proposition. Well, I\nwill do as the Russians say, take my thoughts to bed with me, since the\nmorning is wiser than the evening. It is all very mysterious. I\ncertainly hope that Annie won't find these things here in the morning\nwhen she comes to clear up. I wonder what the Museum would give me for\nthem if they were not, as I think they are, the unsubstantial fabric of\na vision?\"\n\nWhen he got into his room and turned the electric light on, he stood\nunder the cluster and held up his closed hand so that the light fell\nupon a curiously engraved scarab set in a heavy gold ring which had been\ngiven to him on his last birthday by Lord Lester Leighton, a wealthy and\naccomplished young nobleman who had devoted his learned leisure to\nEgyptian exploration and research. It was he who had sent the Mummy of\nQueen Nitocris to the house on Wimbledon Common instead of adding it to\nhis own collection--not altogether unselfishly, it must be confessed,\nfor he was very much in love with the other Nitocris who was still in\nthe flesh.\n\n\"Now,\" he said, fingering the scarab, \"if I was not dreaming, and if by\nsome mysterious means Her Highness's promise is to be actually\nfulfilled, I ought to be able to take this ring off without opening my\nhand. Certainly, any fourth dimensional being could do it.\"\n\nAs he spoke he pulled at the setting of the scarab--and, to his\namazement, the ring came off whole. There was no scar on his finger--no\nbreak in the ring.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" he exclaimed, staring with something like fear in his\neyes, first at his hand, and then at the ring. \"Then it _is_ true!\" He\nwas silent for a full minute; then he put the ring down on the\ndressing-table and whispered: \"What a terrible power--and what an awful\nresponsibility! Well, thank God, I am a fairly honest man!\"\n\nAs he undressed he was conscious of a curious sense of reminiscence\nwhich he had never experienced before. His brain was not only perfectly\nclear, but almost abnormally active, and yet the current of his thoughts\nappeared to be turned backward instead of forward. The things of his own\nlife, the life that he was then living, seemed to drift behind him. The\nfacts which he had learned in his long and minute study of Egyptian\nhistory came up in his mind, no longer as facts learned from books and\nmonuments, wall-paintings, and hieroglyphics, but as living entities. He\nseemed to know, not by memory, but of immediate knowledge. It was the\ndifference between the reading of the story, say, of a battle, and\nactually taking part in it. He got into bed, and turned over on his\nright side, saying:\n\n\"Well, this is all very extraordinary. I wonder what it all means? Thank\ngoodness, I am sleepy enough, and sleep is the best of all medicines. I\nshould not wonder if I were to dream of Memphis again to-night. A\nwonderfully beautiful mummy that, quite unique--and Nitocris, too.\nGood-night, Nitocris, my royal mistress that might have been!\nGood-night!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nBACK TO THE PAST\n\n\nThe City of a Hundred Kings, vast and sombre, stretched away into the\ndim, soft distance of the moonlit night to right and left and far behind\nhim. In front lay the broad, smooth, silver-gleaming Nile, then\napproaching its full flood-time, and looking like a wide, shining road\nout of the shadows through the light and into the shadows again--symbol\nof the visible present coming invisibly out of the domains of the past,\nand fading away into the still more hazy domain of the unknown future.\nSymbol, too, in its countless ripples under the fresh north wind, of the\ngenerations of Man drifting endlessly down the Stream of Time.\n\nHe was standing in the dark shadows of a huge pylon at one end of the\nbroad white terrace of the palace of Pepi in Memphis--he, Ma-Rim[=o]n,\nPriest of Amen-Ra and Initiate of the Higher Mysteries.\n\nNitocris was standing beside him with her hands clasped behind her and\nher head slightly thrown back, and as she gazed out over the river the\nmoonlight fell full on the white loveliness of her face and into the\ndark depths of her eyes, where it seemed to lose itself in the dusk that\nlay deep down in them, a dusk like the shadow of a soul in sorrow.\n\nHe looked upon her face, and saw in it a beauty and a mystery deeper\neven than the beauty and the mystery of the Egyptian night as it was in\nthose old days--the face of a fair woman, a riddle of the gods which men\nmight go mad in seeking to read aright, and yet never learn the true\nmeaning of it.\n\nThe silence between them had been long and yet so solemn in its wordless\nmeaning that he had not dared to break it. Then at length she spoke,\nmoving only her lips, her body still motionless and her eyes still\ngazing at the stars, or into the depths beyond them.\n\n\"Can it be true, Ma-Rim[=o]n? Can the gods indeed have permitted such a\nthing to be? Can the All-Father have given His Chief Minister to be the\ninstrument of such a foul crime and monstrous impiety as this?\"\n\nAnd he replied, slowly and sadly:\n\n\"Yes, it is true, Nitocris, true that thou art now Queen in the land by\nthe will of the great Rameses; and true also it is that the shade of\nNefer is now waiting in the halls of Amenti till his murderers shall be\nsent by the hand of a just vengeance into the presence of the Divine\nAssessors.\"\n\n\"Ah yes, vengeance,\" she replied, turning towards him with a gasp in her\nvoice, \"that must come; but whose hand shall cast the spear or draw the\nbow? We claim kinship with the gods, but we are not the gods, and what\nmortal hand could avenge a crime like this?\"\n\n\"A woman's hand is soft and a woman's lips are sweet, yet what so cruel\nor so merciless in all the world as a woman? As there is nothing liker\nHeaven than a woman's love, so there is nothing liker Hell than a\nwoman's hate. So saith the Ancient Wisdom, O Nitocris; and therefore, as\nthou hast loved Nefer the Prince, so shalt thou also hate Menkau-Ra and\nAnemen-Ha, his murderers and the destroyers of his promised happiness.\"\n\nShe shivered as he spoke, not with cold, for the breath of that perfect\nnight was well nigh as soft as her touch and as warm as her own breath.\nShe turned swiftly and laid her hand on his shoulder. Her touch was as\nlight as the falling of the rose-leaves in the gardens of Sais, yet he\ntrembled under it, and his face, which had been as pale as her own\nbefore, flushed darkly red as she looked into his eyes.\n\n\"You--yes, you, Ma-Rim[=o]n, you too love me, do you not--truly? The\nstars are the eyes of the gods: they are looking on you. Tell me, do you\nlove me? Does your blood throb in your veins when I touch you? Does your\nheart beat quicker when you come near me? Are your ears keener for my\nvoice than for that of any other woman--tell me?\"\n\nHis hands went up and clasped hers as they lay on his shoulders. He took\nher right hand and pressed it to his heart, and laid her left hand on\nhis cheek. Then he let them fall. He stepped back, bowed his head, and\nsaid:\n\n\"The Queen is answered!\"\n\n\"Not the Queen, but the woman, Ma-Rim[=o]n, and as a woman loves to be\nanswered. And now the woman shall speak. Nefer is dead, yet is not Nefer\nre-incarnated in another form, another man of another build, but yet\nNefer that was--and is beside me now?\"\n\nShe whispered these words very softly and very distinctly, and as the\nwords came rippling out from between her half-smiling lips, she took\nhalf a pace forward and looked up into his face.\n\n\"Not dead--Nefer--I!\" he exclaimed, starting back. \"Have not the\nParaschites done their work on his body? Is not his mummy even now\nresting in the City of the Dead? How can it be? Surely, Nitocris, thou\nart dreaming.\"\n\n\"And hast thou, a priest and sage, standing on the threshold of the Holy\nMysteries, hast thou not learned the law which tells thee how, with the\npermission of the Divine Assessors, the souls of the dead may come back\nfrom the halls of Amenti to do their bidding in other mortal shapes? And\nwhat if they should have ordained that his soul should have thus\nreturned?\n\n\"Thou, who art so like him that while he was yet alive mortal eyes could\nscarce distinguish the one from the other. May it not be that the gods,\nwho foresee all things, made thee in the same image, perchance to this\nvery end?\"\n\n\"No, the riddle is too deep for me, even as that other riddle which I\nread in thy eyes, O Queen!\"\n\n\"Let thy love help thee to read it, then!\" she replied, coming to him\nand putting her hands on his shoulders again. \"Tell me now, Ma-Rim[=o]n,\nwhat wouldst thou do if thy soul were now waiting in the land of Aalu\nand the soul of Nefer was listening to me with thine ears, and looking\nat me with thine eyes?\"\n\n\"And if thou----\"\n\n\"Yes, and if I too believed that this were so?\"\n\nHe saw the sweet, red, smiling lips coming nearer to him, and felt the\nsoft breath on his bare throat. He saw the deep eyes melting into\ntenderness as the moonlight shone upon them, and in the pale olive\ncheeks a faint flush swiftly deepened.\n\n\"Nefer or Ma-Rim[=o]n, I am mortal,\" he said, swiftly catching her\nwrists and drawing her towards him. \"I am flesh and blood. I am man, and\nthou art woman--and I love thee! I love thee! Ah, how sweet thy kisses\nare! Now let the gods bless or curse, for never could they take away\nwhat thou hast given--and for it I will give thee all. All that has\nbeen, and is, and might have been! Priest and sage, Initiate of the\nMysteries, what are they to me now! O Nitocris, my queen and my love!\nSooner would I live through one year of bliss with thee than an\neternity in the Peace of the Gods itself!\"\n\nThe words of blasphemy came hot and fast between his kisses, and she\nheard them unresisting in his arms, giving him back kiss for kiss, and\nlooking into his eyes under the dark lashes which half-hid hers; and so\nMa-Rim[=o]n, the youthful Initiate of the Holy Mysteries, became in that\nmoment a man, and so he began to learn the long lesson which teaches to\nwhat heights and depths a woman who has loved and hated can rise and\nfall for the sake of her love and her hate.\n\n\"And now, my Nefer,\" she went on, throwing her clinging arms round his\nneck again, \"now, good-night! Go and dream of me as I will dream of\nthee, and remember that, though mortals may plan, the gods decide. We\nmay try to paint the picture, but the outline is drawn by their hands\nand may not be changed by ours. But, so far as this matter is concerned,\nI swear by the Veil of Isis, by these sacred kisses of ours, and by the\nUraeus Crown of the Three Kingdoms, that, rather than be sold as a\npriceless chattel to grace the triumph of Menkau-Ra, I will give myself,\nas others did in the old days, to be the bride of Father Nile. Remember\nthat, and remember, too, that, whatever the outward seeming of things\nmay be, I am thine and thou art mine, as it was, and is, and shall be,\nuntil the Peace of all Things shall come.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen the dream-vision changed from moonlight to sunlight, from night to\nmorning; for it was the dawn of the day that was to see, as all men\nbelieved, the gorgeous ceremony of the nuptials of the daughter of\nRameses with Menkau-Ra, the Mohar, chief of the House of War and\nmightiest of all the warriors of the Land of Khem, now that Rameses had\npassed from the black banks of the Nile to the shores of Amenti, and his\nmummy was waiting the summons of the High Gods which should recall it to\nlife in the fulness of time and the dawn of the Everlasting Peace.\n\nNever had even the Land of Khem seen a fairer dawn. The East shone in\nsilver, blushed into amethyst, and flamed in gold as the Restorer of all\nthings rose bright and glorious in sudden splendour over the City of the\nWhite Wall. Standing on the flat roof of the temple of Ptah, he looked\nabout him in the first flush of this morning which had just dawned, big\nwith fate, not only for him and his beloved, but also for the Land of\nKhem, and perchance for the world.\n\nThe great river was spreading its annual blessings over the land. The\nwaters were broadening out into wide shining sheets, and the slow, soft\nmusic of their rippling was stealing along the great water-walls of the\ntemples and palaces which formed the river-front of Memphis. Only a week\nago the victorious armies of Khem had brought their spoils and their\nprisoners across the eastern frontier. There had been fruit, bread, and\nflesh, and wine for the poor, and banquets of royal lavishness for\nthose who could claim right of entry into the sacred circle which\nenclosed the Throne, the Temple, and the camp of the victorious warrior.\n\nFor days he had heard the name of Menkau-Ra the Conqueror shouted up to\nthe heavens by the crowds that had thronged the streets and the\nmarket-places, and, mingled with it, he had also heard the name of the\ngirl-queen whose arms had been about his neck, and whose lips he had\nkissed the night before, and he knew that even now the people were\nasking why the Conqueror should not wed the daughter of Rameses, and\nbecome the father of a line of even greater and yet mightier Pharaohs.\n\nHe had heard their cries calmly and without anger, for he knew that that\none stolen hour of sweet intercourse with her meant much more than the\nConqueror himself could win--something that could not be taken by force,\nor even through the will of the dead king. Her soul was his, and he knew\nwell that the man to whom she had not given her soul would never be\npermitted to lay a loving hand on her body.\n\n\"Ah yes, there he comes, I suppose,\" he went on, still talking aloud to\nhimself, as a shrill musical peal of silver trumpets broke out from the\ndirection of the barracks to the north of the palace. \"Alas! were I but\ntruly Nefer! That golden-crowned murderer--for sure I am that he killed\nhim--he would not now be making ready for his triumph at the head of\nhis victorious troops through the streets and squares of Memphis. If\nthat were so, how glad a day this would be for Egypt and for us!\"\n\nBut, as the Divine Assessors willed it, there was no triumph that day in\nMemphis. The sun had hardly risen to a level with the topmost wall of\nthe Rameseum before messengers were sent out from the palace bearing the\ntidings that Nitocris the Queen had been stricken with a sudden malady,\nand that all festivities were to be deferred till the next day at the\nearliest.\n\nThat night, when the moon was sinking low down in the west towards the\ndark hills of the Libyan Desert, and the Isis Star was glowing palely\nlike an expiring lamp hung high above the brightening eastern\nearth-line, he saw her muffled form gliding ghost-like towards him as he\nstood waiting for her on the terrace. She was clad like the meanest of\nher serving-maids, just as a common slave-wench who had stolen out to\nmeet a lover of her own sort might have been. When she came within a\npace of him, he held his arms out. She put hers out too, and for a\nmoment they looked in silence into each other's eyes, and then she,\nseeing that the kiss which she expected did not come, parted her lips\nand said smilingly:\n\n\"You need not fear to kiss them, dearest, they have not yet been\npolluted by the lips of Menkau-Ra, although all the city has been\nhailing him as the betrothed of Nitocris.\"\n\nThen he smiled too, and their lips met in such a long, silent kiss as\nonly lovers give and take.\n\n\"Thy words are almost as sweet as thy kisses are, O Nitocris!\" he said,\n\"for I would sooner see thee--yes, I would sooner see thee in the hands\nof the Paraschites--this lovely body of thine dead--knowing that thy\nsoul was waiting for mine on the shores of Amenti, than I would know\nthat those sweet lips had been defiled by the touch of such as he; and\nyet surely thou hast spoken with him. Did he not claim the fulfilment of\nthe promise of the great king?\"\n\n\"Ah yes,\" she replied softly, as she slipped out of his arms, \"but it is\none thing to claim and another to get. Yes, I have spoken with him. I\nhave promised all, and given nothing. I have not even yielded my hand to\nhis lips, for I told him in answer to all the entreaties of his\nlove--and of a truth I tell thee that he loves me very dearly, for that\ngreat, strong frame of his shook like a bulrush in the wind under the\nbreath of my lightest words--that, until the last vows had made us man\nand wife, I would be his queen and he should be my subject and my slave,\neven as he was of the great Rameses; and with this he was fain to be\ncontent, thinking, no doubt, how soon he would be my lord and master,\nand I his--his queen and plaything, bound by the law that may not be\nbroken, to submit to every varying whim and humour of his passion.\"\n\n\"Thy master, Nitocris! Thine! Such shame could never be. Rather would\nthe High Gods permit Death to be the Master of Life, or Night to be Lord\nof Day. Is there no other way?\"\n\n\"Yes, there is another way, and only one to save me, Nefer--if truly the\nsoul of my beloved is looking out of thine eyes into mine,\" she\nwhispered, coming close to him and laying her hands lightly upon his\nshoulders, \"there is another way, but it is the way that leads through\nthe mystery of the things that are into the deeper mystery of the things\nthat are to be--the way of death and vengeance. Tell me, my beloved,\nhast thou the courage to tread it with me?\"\n\nThe lovely face, the pleading lips, the searching eyes were close to\nhis. He could feel the soft contact of her body, even her fluttering\nheartbeats answering his. It was the moment of the supreme test, the\nparting of the ways--to the heights whose pinnacles reach to the heaven\nof Perfect Knowledge, or to the abysses whose lowest depths are the roof\nof hell; for there is but one heaven and one hell, and their names are\nKnowledge and Ignorance.\n\nThere lay the fulfilment of his vows, the renunciation of the lower life\nwith all its potent witcheries of the senses, with all its exquisite\ndelights and glittering prizes, fame and honours, power and wealth,\nand, dearest of all, the love of woman.\n\nHere, clasped in his arms, stood Nitocris, her hands still resting\nlightly on his shoulders, her head lying on his breast, her eyes\nupturned, the star-beams swimming in their luminous depths.\n\n\"Nefer, beloved, answer me!\"\n\nThe stars grew dim, and the solid floor of the terrace shook under his\nfeet. He bent his head and laid his lips upon hers.\n\n\"Thou art answered, O Nitocris--even unto death and the life beyond!\"\n\nHer lips returned his kisses--kisses that were curses--and then for many\nminutes they conversed in hurried whispers. At last she slipped out of\nhis arms and left him, his lips burning from the clinging touch of hers,\nand his heart cold with a fear that was greater than the fear of death.\n\nHe clasped his hands to his temples and looked up at the coldly shining\nIsis Star, and through the silence there came to his soul in the speech\nthat is never heard by the ears of flesh the fateful words:\n\n\"Once only is it given to mortals to look into the eyes of Isis. He who\nlooks and turns his gaze aside has found and lost.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE DEATH-BRIDAL OF NITOCRIS\n\n\nThe day of the bridal of Nitocris the Queen with Menkau-Ra the Conqueror\nhad come and gone in a blaze of golden splendour. In all the Upper and\nLower Lands no head was held so proudly as the head of Menkau-Ra, no\nheart beat so high as his that day, nor did any cheek bloom so sweetly,\nor any eyes shine so brightly as the cheeks and the eyes of Nitocris--so\nstrange are the workings of a woman's heart, and so far are its\nmysteries past finding out.\n\nAnd now the bridal feast was spread in the great banqueting hall which\nPepi the Wise had made deep down in the foundations of his palace below\nthe waters of the Nile at flood-time, and at midnight the waters would\nbe at the full. It was here that Nitocris had sat at the betrothal feast\nwith Nefer but a few hours before his death, for here he had drunk from\nthe poisoned cup which Anemen-Ha the High Priest had prepared, and here\nonly would Nitocris meet her guests.\n\nThe great hall shone with the light of a thousand golden lamps, which\nshed their radiance and the perfume from the scented oils in which were\ndissolved the most precious gums of the distant East.\n\nThe long tables, spread with snowy linen and loaded with vessels of gold\nand silver and glass of many hues and curious forms, flashed and\nglittered in the glow of the thousand flames. The vineyards of Cos and\nSais had yielded their oldest and sweetest wines, red and purple and\ngolden. The choicest meats and the rarest fruits that ripened under the\nglowing suns of Khem--all was there that could make glad the heart of\nman and fill his soul with contentment.\n\nAt the centre of the table, which stood on a raised platform in front of\nthe great black pedestal of the Colossus of Pepi, Nitocris the Queen sat\nin her chair of ivory and gold, clad in almost transparent robes of the\nfinest silk of Cos, shining with gems, and crowned with the Uraeus\nSnake, and the double diadem of the Two Lands.\n\nOn her right sat Menkau-Ra, crowned and robed in royal vesture, and on\nher left Anemen-Ha in his priestly garments of snowy linen. At the other\ntables sat their friends and kindred, the families of the Mohar and the\nHigh Priest, the chief officers of the victorious army and all the proud\nhierarchy of the Temple of Ptah, for was not this the triumph of\nAnemen-Ha no less than of Menkau-Ra?\n\nOnly Ma-Rim[=o]n was absent. He had disappeared from the temple early\nin the morning, and no one had given a thought to his going, for one\nbase-born, even though of royal blood, had no place at the bridal feast\nof the Queen and her chosen consort.\n\nThe libations had been poured out to the Lords and Ladies of Heaven--to\nPtah the Beginner, and Ra the Lord of Day, to Sechet the Lady of Love\nand War, and Necheb the Bringer of Victory; and when the slaves had\ncarried round the viands till all were satisfied, the guests were\ncrowned with garlands, and the jars of the oldest and choicest wines\nwere broached. The feast was ended, and the revel was about to begin.\n\nThe last half of the last hour of the night was well-nigh spent, and\nwhile the guests were waiting for the signal from the royal table, the\nQueen rose in her place, and, in the silence that greeted her, her voice\nsounded sweetly as she spoke and said:\n\n\"O my guests--ye who are the holiest and the bravest in the Land of\nKhem, though our hearts are joyful, and our souls refreshed with wine\nand good cheer, let us not forget the pious customs and wise ways of our\nancestors, for it is fitting that in such hours as this our hearts\nshould be turned from pride by the remembrance that we live ever in the\npresence of death, and that this world is but the threshold of the next.\nIll, too, would it become me to forget, in the midst of my present\nhappiness, to pay the honour due to him who might have shared this crown\nwith me; wherefore let the noble dead be brought into our midst, so\nthat the soul of Nefer, looking down from the flowery fields of Aalu,\nmay see that in the hour of our joy we do not forget the sorrow of his\nuntimely death.\"\n\nThen she clapped her hands, and Menkau-Ra and Anemen-Ha shifted in their\nseats, and looked at each other with eyes of evil meaning as six slaves\nappeared at the lower end of the hall, bearing upon their shoulders the\nmummy-case of Nefer, the dead Prince, beloved of Nitocris. Now low, sad\nmusic sounded from a hidden source, and to the cadence of this the\nslaves marched slowly round the tables, followed by the eyes of the\nsilenced and sobered guests. Then they stopped in front of the Queen's\nseat, and she said:\n\n\"Let the case be set up against the central pillar yonder, and let the\nface of the Prince be uncovered, that I may look upon him who was to\nhave been my lord.\"\n\n\"But if I may speak, Royal Egypt,\" said Anemen-Ha, the chief of the\nHouse of Ptah, leaning towards her, \"that would be beyond the law of the\ngods and the customs of the land. To look on the face of the dead were\ndefilement for thee and us.\"\n\n\"Yet this once it shall be done, O Priest of the Father of the Gods,\"\nanswered Nitocris, turning and looking into his eyes, \"for last night I\nhad a vision, and I saw the soul of Nefer come back to his mummy, here\nin this hall, at my bridal feast, and his eyes opened, and his lips\nspoke, and made plain to me many things that I greatly longed to know.\nBut why shouldst thou turn pale and tremble, thou the holiest man in the\nland? What hast thou to fear, even if my vision came true? And thou,\ntoo, Menkau-Ra the Mighty, hast thou slain thy thousands, and yet\nfearest to look upon the face of one dead man? See, see!\" and she\npointed her finger at the face of the mummy. \"By the power of the just\nand merciful gods, my vision shall be made very truth indeed! Look,\nAnemen-Ha, Priest of the God who is King of Gods! Look, Menkau-Ra, thou\nwho wouldst reign in the place of Nefer. Behold, he has come back from\nthe bosom of Osiris to greet thee!\"\n\nWith eyes fixed and ears sharpened by such terror as only the\nsin-steeped soul can know, they saw the waxen eyelids of the mummy\nslowly rise, the dim, glazed eyes look out from underneath them, the\ndry, black lips move, and heard a thin, harsh voice say through the\nawful silence:\n\n\"Greeting, Nitocris, my Queen--greeting from the gloom of Amenthes,\nwhere I have waited too long for those who ere now should have stood\nwith me in the Halls of Doom and the presence of the Assessors! Say now,\nthou who sittest feasting between my murderers, how much longer must I\nwait for thee and them?\"\n\nNot long, O Nefer, my beloved, not long! Tarry yet a little while, O\noutraged soul, in the shape that once was thine, and thou shalt see\nthyself avenged. Lo, I hear the wings of Kefa, Goddess of the\nFlood-time, rustling in the silence of the midnight skies. She herself\nshall pour out a libation to thine injured shade! \"Nay, nay, my lords,\nand you good friends of those who did my own true lord to death, sit\nstill, and drain a farewell cup with me, your Queen. It is too late to\nfly, for every way is closed. The High Gods have spoken, and I will do\ntheir bidding!\" Then, extending her white, jewelled arms toward the\nmummy, she cried in a deeper, harsher tone: \"O Nefer, my Prince and my\nlove! There lives no man in Khem who shall take thy place beside me, or\nusurp the throne that should have been thine. I have sinned, but I\nrepent me of the wrong. Lo, now I come and bring thee a goodly sacrifice\nto cheer thine angry heart--my lord, my love, I come!\"\n\nHeld by the triple spell of guilt and fear and wonder, they listened to\nthese terrible words in silence, white horror sitting on their blanching\ncheeks and brows.\n\nAs she ceased she raised her arms above her head, a golden cup\nfull-crowned between her glittering hands. A moment she held it aloft,\nthen dashed it to the floor, and cried in a voice that rang like the\nlaughter of devils through the awful silence:\n\n\"Come, Kefa, come, and bear me to my lord!\"\n\nThe goddess answered in a mighty rush and roar of waters, long pent and\nswiftly loosed. Then above the tumult rose the hoarse shouts of men and\nthe shrill screams of women, and the crash and clash of tables\noverturned; then came the swirl and bubbling hiss of a flood that\ngleamed darkly under the golden lamps and swiftly rose towards them,\nbearing upon its surface white arms with outstretched hands gripping at\nthe empty air, and gauzy robes which half hid gleaming limbs, white\nfaces with wildly-staring eyes, and teeth that grinned between\ntight-drawn lips so lately smiling; strong swimmers fighting for another\nmoment's breath, and one by one dragged down by many hidden hands: then\nthe sharp hiss of swift-quenched flames, then darkness, and the stifling\nof sobbing groans into silence, and after that only the sibilant\nundertone of waters rushing swiftly past smooth walls through utter\nnight.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Dear me!\" the Professor heard himself say as he sat up and rubbed his\neyes, \"what on earth can be the matter with me? Egypt--the Queen--Palace\nof Pepi--bridal feast of Nitocris and Menkau-Ra--yes, yes, of course I\nremember it all now. She made me impersonate Nefer in the mummy-case,\nand then, when she had frightened her guests half out of their wits, she\navenged her lover by opening the sluice-gates and drowning the lot,\nherself included. A rare device, that of old Pepi's, for getting rid of\nhospitably entertained enemies. Not quite in accordance with our modern\nideas of sport, I'm afraid, but in those days we thought a good deal\nmore of effectiveness than sport. Good heavens! What sort of nonsense am\nI talking? Dreaming, I suppose.\"\n\nHe stopped as the reflection of a brilliant flash of lightning lit up\nhis window, and bursts of rain dashed upon the panes.\n\n\"Ah yes, of course, that's it! Quite in accordance with the theory of\ndreams. It's only the difference between a thunder-shower and the Nile\nflood. The Genius of Dreams could easily account for the rest. Certainly\nthis apparatus that we call our brain plays some very curious tricks\nwith us sometimes. I suppose this is one of them. And yet if ever there\nwas a dream that seemed like reality that one did. The Mummy and the\nlong-dead Nitocris back to life! By the way, I wonder whether that\nflagon was really there, and whether there _was_ any wine in it? If\nthere was, perhaps I took too much of it. Ah, there's the rain again!\n\n\"By the way now, suppose that this fourth dimension that has puzzled so\nmany of us is, after all, duration? If so, it would solve a great many\nproblems, because it would be possible to be and not to be at the same\ntime, and, therefore, for two bodies to occupy the same space. That\nwould be perfectly easy of supposition to the being to whom time and\neternity were one. Yes, I believe that when the great problem is solved,\nit will be found that the fourth dimension _is_ duration, extending in\nall directions like the circumference of a circle, the edges of a cube,\nand the curves of the conic sections.\n\n\"Yes, I really do think I have got it at last, and that confounded Mummy\nhas taught it me. Still, I don't think I ought to speak as\ndisrespectfully as that of a young lady who has been dead for the last\nfifty centuries or so and has come back. Yes, that is it. It _is_\nduration.\"\n\nPerfectly satisfied for the time being with this solution, he turned\nover on to his right side--for, to his disgust, he found that he had\nbeen lying on his back, a most pernicious position where dreaming is\nconcerned--and went to sleep. Half an hour later he was awakened by\nanother heaven-shaking crash of thunder.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTHIEVES IN THE NIGHT\n\n\nThis time he was very much awake. In fact, his sense of wakefulness\nseemed almost superhuman. His faculties were preternaturally alert, and\nhe had a feeling of what might properly be called mental extension--it\nwas not exaltation--- which seemed to widen his mental vision\nenormously. Problems which had puzzled him to desperation suddenly\nbecame as obvious as the first axioms of geometry. In short, he felt as\nthough he had become a new man, re-born, or re-incarnated, into another\nworld which contained the one he had so far lived in, but which was\ninfinitely vaster in some undefined way which was not yet plain to him.\n\nHe lay for some time thinking over the extraordinary happenings of the\nevening and his dream, which he remembered with astonishing exactness of\ndetail. Then a sudden turn of thought carried his mind to the subject of\nmiracles, apparitions, ghosts, and mathematical impossibilities such as\nsquaring the circle and doubling the cube--and to his amazement he found\nthat the impossible of yesterday had become the possible--nay, the\nalmost absurdly obvious of to-night.\n\nHe went on thinking and wondering until he began to half-believe that he\nwas dreaming again, so he got up and switched on the electric light.\nThen he turned involuntarily towards the wardrobe, which, as usual, had\na long mirror running down the middle of it. To his amazement he did not\nsee himself reflected in it. The mirror seemed to have vanished, and in\nits place was a window looking into his study.\n\nHe saw the mummy-case leaning up against the wall, but it was empty. In\nfront of it stood a man and a woman. Both were plainly, almost meanly,\ndressed; the man in a tightly-buttoned black frock-coat and baggy grey\ntrousers; the woman in a plain gown of dark stuff, and a shawl which was\ndraped round her head and shoulders in somewhat Eastern fashion.\n\nHe could see their faces distinctly in profile. They were of the classic\nCoptic type which so persistently reproduces the features of the old\nEgyptians as we see them outlined in the wall-paintings of the temples\nand the half-mutilated carvings and statues. The window of the study was\nopen, but the door was shut; so was the door of his own room, but for\nall that he distinctly heard the man say to the woman in Coptic, which,\ncuriously enough, sounded as familiar to his ears as the faces seemed to\nhis eyes:\n\n\"Neb-Anat, it is gone! These heathen ravishers have not been content\nwith stealing the body of our Queen from its sacred resting-place and\nbringing it here, whither we have traced it with so much labour. See, it\nhas been stolen again; hidden, no doubt, so that the servants of the\nKing could not find it. It may be that even we have been suspected and\nwatched, in spite of all our care. Yet it must be found, or the doom\nthat may not be revoked will be ours.\"\n\n\"Even so, Pent-Ah,\" replied the woman in a soft, musical voice which\nwell suited the comeliness of her face; \"but though the priceless\ntreasure has been taken from its casket, it cannot have been carried out\nof the house, for you know that every approach has been watched closely\nsince it was brought here. Come, in this house it must be, and to find\nit is our task. Every one is asleep; take off thy shoes and let us\nsearch.\"\n\nShe took off her own shoes as she spoke, and he saw the man do the same.\nThen, as the man opened the door and they passed out of the study, the\npicture vanished from the mirror.\n\nAmazement at what he had seen and heard--the disappearance of the Mummy,\nthe presence of the man and woman, evidently charged with what they\nbelieved to be the sacred mission of stealing it back again, and their\nevident purpose of searching the house for it--instantly gave place to a\nquick thrill of fear.\n\nHis daughter's bedroom was on the same floor as the study, only a\ncouple of doors away round the corner of the landing. These people would\nsearch every room. What if she had not locked her door securely, or if\nthey had some means of opening it? She was the living image of the dead\nNitocris. He did not dare to think of what might happen to her. Would\nthese new-found, strangely-given powers of his suffice to protect her?\nIf not, he would have but little use for them, since she was his nearest\nand dearest on earth.\n\nHe pulled his stockings over the pants of his pyjamas and put on his\nvelvet working jacket, forgetting for the moment that, if these things\nwere true, it would be perfectly easy for him to make himself invisible\nto beings in the ordinary world of three dimensions. Then he turned out\nthe light, opened the door very softly, and crept downstairs.\n\nYes, what he had seen was true. He heard the soft, shuffling patter of\nstockinged feet along the landing, though he could see nothing in the\ndark. A door opened gently. His sense of location told him that it was\nthe door of the spare bedroom next but one to the study. He felt his way\nsilently and softly along the wall, and as he did so his hand touched\nthe electric switch. Should he turn the light on and alarm the house?\nWhoever was there had \"broken and entered\" after midnight, and was\ntherefore outside the law. No, he would not do that. If what he had\nseen was true, the intruders believed that their mission was a sacred\none. No doubt the man was armed, and perhaps the woman also, and what\nwould a knife-stab mean to them on such a desperate quest?\n\nAs these thoughts ran at lightning speed through his mind, he saw a\nfaint glow inside the room. He crept forward and looked round the side\nof the doorway. The man had a little electric lamp in his hand and was\nflashing the slender rays all over the room. He drew his head back\nquickly as he heard him say:\n\n\"There is nothing here, Anat. Come, let us try the next room. Neither\nlock nor bolt nor even human life must stand in the way of our search\nnow that we have begun it!\"\n\nHe heard them coming towards the door. Instinctively he shrank back, and\nhis heart stood still as he thought of what would happen if the man\nchanced to turn the little ray of his lamp on him. Almost involuntarily\nhis thoughts went back to the promise of Queen Nitocris, and something\nlike a prayer that it might be kept rose to his lips.\n\nThey came out, and the man flashed the thin electric ray up and down the\npassage. It wavered hither and thither, and at last fell directly on his\nface. He was anything but a coward, but he was thinking of Niti--and\nwhat if a knife-stab left her undefended? But to his amazement, although\nthey were both looking straight at him, the expression of neither face\nchanged in the slightest. They had not seen him. The Queen had answered\nhis prayer. He was no longer in the world of three dimensions, and so he\nwas invisible to all dwellers in it. For him, then, there was evidently\nno danger--but Niti----?\n\nThey moved along to the next door. That was hers. The woman put her hand\non the knob and turned it. To his horror, the door opened. She had\nforgotten to lock it. They both crept in, and he followed them boldly\nenough now, knowing what he did. The ray leapt rapidly about the room\ntill it fell on the bed with its pale blue silken coverlet, and then on\nthe pillow, on which rested the head of the sleeping, breathing image of\nthe long-dead Queen.\n\nWith a half-stifled gasp the man shrank back and dropped the lamp, and\nthe Professor heard him say to the woman in a shuddering whisper:\n\n\"By the High Gods, Neb-Anat, it is a miracle! Do you not see her? It is\nshe--the Queen--alive again, as the ancient prophecy said she should be.\nWhat magic have these heathens used?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the woman, whispering lower, \"truly it is the Queen, and\nshe is alive and sleeping--no doubt passing from the sleep of death\nthrough the sleep of life to life again. Now, O Pent-Ah, is our task\nmuch harder, yet will its accomplishment be all the more glorious for\nyou and me, and greatly will our Lord reward us if we can restore to his\nkeeping, not the ravished mummy of Nitocris, but the Queen herself,\nwarm and breathing and beautiful, as she was in the ancient days of the\ngreat Rameses.\"\n\n\"I'll be hanged if you do!\" said the Professor to himself, \"not, at\nleast, if Her Majesty's legacy to me is worth anything. Abduct my\ndaughter at the dead of night, would you, you scoundrels? We'll see\nabout that. If you don't leave this house as thoroughly frightened as\never you were in your lives, I know nothing about the fourth dimension.\"\n\nMeanwhile he heard them both groping about the floor after the lamp. The\nwoman found it, and pressed the button. The ray fell on the man's face,\nand he saw that the olive of his skin had turned to a ghastly grey. His\neyes were wide open, and his mouth and nostrils were working with\nintense excitement. Then the woman turned the ray on Niti's face again.\n\n\"They will wake her if this goes on much longer,\" said the Professor to\nhimself again. \"I had better stop this little comedy before it becomes a\ntragedy. Poor Niti would go half mad if she found these two scoundrels\nby her bedside--and yet if I do anything out of the way they will yell.\nAh, I think I have it!\"\n\nHe walked softly out of the room, and when he got into the passage he\nwhispered in the tongue that had become so strangely familiar to him:\n\n\"Pent-Ah, Neb-Anat, come hither instantly! Who are you that you should\ndisturb the slumbers of your Lady the Queen!\"\n\nHe saw them stare at each other with eyes wide with fear and wonder.\n\n\"It is the command of the Mighty One,\" whispered the woman, taking hold\nof the man's hand and drawing him towards the door.\n\n\"And He must be obeyed,\" said he in reply, bowing his head and following\nher.\n\nThey closed the door very softly behind them.\n\nThe Professor could not repress a sigh of thankfulness for Niti's escape\nfrom what, at best, would have been a very terrible fright.\n\n\"And now, my friends,\" he went on to himself, \"I think I can teach you\nnot to come into an English gentleman's house again with an idea of\nstealing his property, to say nothing of abducting his daughter.\"\n\nThe man and woman were still staring at each other by the light of the\nlamp, each holding each other's trembling hand, when the lamp was\nsuddenly snatched away from the woman and went out. Then, to their\nhorror, the ray shot out again in front of them as though the lamp were\nfloating by itself in the air. It flashed from face to face, both\nghastly with fear. Then an invisible hand gripped the man's, and drew\nhim with irresistible force along the passage. The woman grasped his\ncoat, and followed with shuffling feet and shaking limbs, dumb with\nwonder and fear. The hand led them down the passage, round the corner,\nand into the study. Then it released them. They heard the door shut and\nthe key turn in the lock. Then there was a click, and the electric\ncluster above the writing-table shone out, apparently of its own\nvolition. The woman uttered a low scream, and cowered down in a corner\nof a big sofa that stood by the bay-window. The man, after one terrified\nglance round the room, began to creep towards the open sash; but the\ninvisible hand gripped him by the collar and pulled him back. His\ntrembling knees gave way under him, and he rolled in a heap on the\nfloor.\n\nThen, to his wondering horror, he saw a stout blackthorn stick which was\nstanding in a corner of the room, jump up into the air and leap towards\nhim. He put his head down on to the carpet, covered his eyes with his\nhands, and began to moan with terror. The stick came down with what\nseemed to him superhuman force again and again on his back and\nshoulders. He whimpered and moaned, and at last howled with pain. He\nrolled over and looked up, and there was the stick hanging in the air\nabove him. He put up his hands clasped as though in prayer, and down it\ncame on his knuckles. He did not howl this time. His hands unclasped and\ndropped beside him; his head went back, and he fainted in sheer terror.\n\n\"There, my friend,\" said the Professor aloud, forgetting the presence of\nthe woman for the moment; \"mummy or no mummy, I don't think you will\ncome into this house again. And as for you, madam,\" he went on, \"of\ncourse, I can't give you a hiding, so the sight of his punishment will\nhave to be enough for you. Still, I think you have had enough of\nattempted mummy-stealing to last you some time.\"\n\nThe woman stared up into the vacancy out of which the voice came, her\neyes dilated, and her lips trembling with the movement of her lower jaw.\nShe saw a jug of water get up off the table and empty itself over her\ncompanion's face. Then she fainted, too.\n\nWhen Pent-Ah came to himself and sat up, he saw an elderly gentleman,\ntall and erect as a man in the prime of life, standing over him with the\nblackthorn in one hand and the water-jug in the other.\n\n\"I am not going to ask what you two are doing here,\" he said sternly,\n\"because I know already. If I called the police I could send you both to\nprison for house-breaking and attempted robbery; but I don't want any\nfuss, and perhaps you have been punished enough for the present. Ah, I\nsee your accomplice is coming round. You came in by the window, I\nsuppose. Now get out by it as quick as you can, and mind you keep your\nmouths shut as to what has happened to-night. If you don't,\" he went on,\nsuddenly changing into Coptic, \"beware of the anger of your Lord--of Him\nwho never forgives!\"\n\nThe man scrambled to his feet, whimpering:\n\n\"I go, Lord, I go, and my lips shall be silent as the lips of----\"\n\nHe cast a frightened glance towards the mummy-case, and then, grasping\nthe woman roughly by the arm, he dragged her towards the open window,\nsaying:\n\n\"Come, Neb-Anat, come ere the wrath of our Lord consumes us!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Why, where's the Mummy, Dad?\" said Miss Nitocris, as she came into her\nfather's study just before breakfast the next morning, and looked in\namazement at the empty case.\n\n\"Stolen, my dear, I am sorry to say,\" replied the Professor gravely.\n\"Did you hear any noises in the house last night, or were you sleeping\ntoo soundly?\"\n\n\"I seem to have an idea that I did,\" she said, \"but only a dim one; I\nthought I only dreamt it. But did you, Dad? Do tell me all about it.\nWhat a horrible shame to steal that lovely Mummy! And it was so like me,\ntoo. I believe I should have got quite fond of it.\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" continued the Professor, speaking, as she thought, a little\nnervously. \"There was a noise, and I heard it. I came down here and\nturned the light on. I found the window open and the Mummy gone--and\nthat is all I can tell you about it.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nACROSS THE THRESHOLD\n\n\nAfter breakfast Professor Marmion, according to his practice on fine\ndays, lit his pipe, and went out for a stroll on the Common to put in a\nlittle hard thinking, while Miss Nitocris, after seeing to certain\nhousehold matters, sat down in his study and read the papers, in order\nthat she might be able to give him a synopsis of the world's news at\nlunch. He did not read the newspapers himself, except, perhaps, in the\ntrain, when he had nothing better to do. He took no interest in\npolitics, for one thing, and he had still less interest in professional\ncricket and football, racing, and what is generally called sport. He had\na fixed opinion that all the events happening in the world which really\nmattered, not even excepting the proceedings of learned societies and\nthe criminal and civil Law Courts, could be adequately recorded on a\ncouple of sheets of notepaper. In other words, he had an absolute\ncontempt for everything that makes a newspaper sell, and therefore his\ndaughter had very soon learnt to omit these fascinating items entirely.\n\nCuriously enough, his mind seemed to be running on this subject of all\nthings that morning. He had been reading an article in the _Fortnightly_\non the growing sensationalism, and therefore the general decadence of\nthe English Press a day or two before, and this had got connected up in\nhis thoughts with the amazing happenings of the last twelve hours, and\nhe asked himself what would happen if he were to give the narrative of\nhis experiences in a letter to the _Times_, supported by the authority\nof his own distinguished and irreproachable name.\n\nCertainly it would be the most sensational communication that had ever\nappeared in a newspaper. In a day or two, granted always that the\n_Times_ had no doubts as to his sanity and printed the letter, the whole\nPress would be ablaze with it; Wimbledon would be besieged by reporters\neager to see miracles; and then they would go away and write lurid\narticles, some about the miracles, if they saw them, and some about an\nabsolutely new form of conjuring that he had invented. Then the\nscientific Press would take it up, and a very merry battle of wits would\nbegin. He smiled gravely as he thought of the inkshed that would come to\npass in a _combat \u00e0 l'outrance_ between the Three Dimensionists and the\nFour Dimensionists, and how the distinguished scientists on each side\nwould hurl their ponderous thunderbolts of wisdom against each other.\n\nThen there would be the religious folk to deal with, for naturally no\ntheologian of any enterprise or self-respect could see a fight like that\ngoing on without taking a hand in it. The Churches, of course, had a\nmonopoly of miracles, or at least the traditions of them. The Christian\nScientists, blatantly, claimed to work them now, but their subjects died\nwith disgusting regularity. So he quickly came to the conclusion that,\nif he were once to state in plain English that he could accomplish the\nseemingly impossible; that he, a mere mortal, could make himself\nindependent of the ordinary conditions of time and space and break with\nimpunity all the laws which govern the physical universe, he would\nsimply make himself the centre of a vortex of frenzied disputation which\nwould shake the social, religious, and scientific worlds to their\nfoundations, and that would certainly not be a pleasant position for an\neminent and respected scientist, who was already a certain number of\nyears past middle age--to say nothing of the very real harm that might\nbe done.\n\nOf course, he could settle all the disputes instantly, and dazzle the\nwhole world into the bargain by simply delivering a lecture, say, before\nthe Royal Society, on the existence of a world of four dimensions, and\nthen proving by ocular demonstration that it does exist; but what would\nhappen then? Simply intellectual anarchy.\n\nEvery belief that man had held for ages would be negatived. For\ninstance, if there is one dogma to which humanity has clung with\nunanimous consistency, it is to the dogma that two and two make four.\nWhat if he were to prove--as, of course, he could do now that this\nmysterious hand, outstretched through the mists of the far past, had led\nhim across the horizon which divides the two states of Existence--that,\nunder certain circumstances, they would also make three or five? What if\nhe demonstrated that even the axioms of Euclid could, under different\nconditions, be both true and false at the same time?\n\nNo, the thought of overthrowing such a venerable authority and plunging\nthe scientific world into a hopeless state of intellectual chaos sent a\nshudder through his nerves. He could not do it.\n\nAnd yet it was only the bare, solid truth that he did possess these\npowers. The dream of the death-bridal of Nitocris might possibly have\nbeen nothing more than just a dream, or possibly the revival of an\nepisode in a past existence; but the other experiences certainly were\nnot. He had taken off his ring without unbending his finger. Yes, he\ncould do it again now; it was just as easy as taking it off in the\nordinary way. He certainly had not been dreaming when the Mummy had\nbecome Queen Nitocris and given him the wine. He could not have been mad\nor dreaming, because his daughter was there. The episode of the strange\nstealers who had come into his house--that too was real, for they had\nleft their lamp and the man's shoes behind them, and the Mummy was gone!\n\nHe took a piece of string out of his pocket, tied the two ends, and then\nwith the greatest ease tied another knot in the string without undoing\nthe first.\n\nA motor-car came humming along the road towards him, and he began to\nthink what this place was like a thousand years before motors were heard\nof. That instant the motor vanished, and he found himself standing in a\nlittle glade surrounded by huge forest trees with not so much as a\nfoot-track in sight. He made his way through the trees in what he\nremembered to be the direction of the road, and presently, through an\nopening avenue, he saw the sun glittering upon something moving, and\nheard voices; and then past the end of the avenue half a dozen armoured\nknights, followed by their squires and a string of men-at-arms guarding\na covered waggon, and after these came a motley little crowd of\ntravellers, some on horseback and some on foot, evidently taking\nadvantage of the escort to protect them from robbers.\n\n\"Dear me!\" said the Professor to himself, not without a little shiver of\napprehension, \"this is very interesting. I seem to have put myself back\ninto the tenth century. Yes, that is certainly tenth-century armour that\nthey're wearing. I mustn't let them see me, or there's no telling what\nthey'd think of an elderly gentleman in a soft hat and a\ntwentieth-century morning suit. But perhaps,\" he went on with his\nreasoning, \"they can't see me at all. My condition is N to the fourth\nnow. There's a thousand years between us; I forgot that. At any rate,\nI'll try it.\"\n\nHe walked quickly down the avenue, and stood by the side of the rugged\npath looking at the strange spectacle. No one took the slightest notice\nof him. And then a chill of awful loneliness struck him. Although he\ncould see and move and hear, and, no doubt, eat and drink in this world,\nhe was unexistent as regards the inhabitants of it, and yet he knew\nperfectly well he was standing by the side of the road where the\nmotor-car ought to be, and over there, a few hundred yards away, Niti\nwould be sitting in her room or walking in the garden--and she wouldn't\nbe born for nearly a thousand years yet.\n\nIt was certainly somewhat disquieting, this power of living in two\nexistences and different ages, but it was a matter that would take some\nlittle time to get accustomed to.\n\nThe next instant the cavalcade and the forest had vanished, and there\nwas the motor-car, just spinning past him. He was on the Wimbledon\nCommon of the twentieth century once more. He stroked his clean-shaven\nchin with his finger and thumb, and walked slowly along the path by the\nside of the road, and then across the grass towards the flagstaff.\n\n\"I think I begin to see it now,\" he murmured. \"Of course, life, that is\nto say real, intellectual, or, as some would say, spiritual life, is,\nafter all, the coefficient of that totally unexplainable thing called\nthought which enables us to explain most things except itself. Time and\nspace and location are only realities to us in so far that we can see\nthem. A human being born blind, dumb, deaf, and without feeling would\nstill, I suppose, be a human being, because it would be conscious of\nexistence; it would breathe and know that its heart was beating, but\nwithout sight or sensation there could be no idea of space--time, to it,\nwould be a meaningless series of breaths or heartbeats. Without touch or\nsight it could have no idea of form or size, which are merely conditions\nof space, and both the past and the future would be absolutely\nnon-existent for it.\"\n\nHe paused, and walked on a little way in silence, arguing silently with\nhimself as to the correctness of these premises. Then he began aloud\nagain:\n\n\"Yes, I think that's about right. And now, suppose that such a being\nbecame endowed with the natural senses, one by one. It would go through\nall the processes of the physical and mental evolution of humanity until\nit reached the highest of human attributes--the ability to think, and\ntherefore to reason. In other words, from a merely living organism it\nwould, in the old Scriptural language, have become a living soul. That\nis, obviously, what the words in Genesis were really intended to mean.\nIt would then become capable of development, of proceeding from the\npartly-known to the more fully known, until, granted perfect physical\nand mental health, it reached what are generally called the limits of\nhuman knowledge.\"\n\nThe Professor's thumb and finger went up to his chin again. He walked\nanother two or three hundred yards in silence; then he recommenced his\nspoken argument with himself:\n\n\"Limits of human knowledge? Yes, that sounds all very well in ordinary\nlanguage, but are there any? Who was it said that a man trying to reach\nthose limits was like the child who saw a rainbow for the first time,\nand started out to find the place where it rested? The simile is not\nbad, not by any means. Just in the same way, we try to imagine the\nlimits of time and space, and we can't do it. Only infinity of space and\nduration are possible, and yet we can't grasp them; still, they are the\nonly possible states in which we can exist. And now, as I have had a\nglimpse of the past, I wonder what this place would be like in ten\nthousand years?\n\n\"Good heavens, how cold it is!\" He shivered, and buttoned up his coat,\nand continued, looking about him on the vast snow-field dotted with\nhummocks of ice which lay bleak and lifeless about him: \"Ah, I suppose\neither the Gulf Stream has got diverted, or the earth's axis has shifted\nand we are in another glacial epoch.\n\n\"WE!\"\n\nAgain the shock of utter isolation struck him, but it seemed to hit him\nharder this time. The world that he had been born in lay ten thousand\nyears behind him. For all he knew, he might be standing upon what was\nnow the earth's North Pole. Civilisation, as he had known it, might have\nbeen wiped off the face of the earth, and the remnants of humanity flung\nback into savagery. He looked up at the sun, and saw that it was almost\nexactly where it had been, and that it had not perceptibly diminished in\npower.\n\nThe idea was not at all pleasant to him, and very naturally his thoughts\nturned back once more to his cosy home that had been on the edge of\nWimbledon Common ten thousand years ago. He remembered, with a curious\nsort of thrill, some notes which he had to complete that morning for his\nlecture--and in the same instant he was walking back across the turf\ntowards his house through the warm May sunshine.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said to himself, as he drew a deep breath of the sweet spring\nair. \"I was right; that's it. The fourth dimension is a form of duration\nin some way correlated with space. I shall have to work that out in the\nlight of the greater knowledge, which Her vanished Majesty has given me,\nand which I almost attained to in Egypt. Wherefore, existence in a state\nof four dimensions, or the world of N4, as I have always called it, is,\nroughly speaking, one. Time and space are, as it were, two sides of the\nsame shield, and a person living in that world can see both of them at\nonce. Wherefore, past, present, future, length, breadth, thickness, here\nand there are all the same thing to him. It's a great pity there isn't a\nfourth dimensional language as well, so that one could state these\nthings a little more precisely. But that, of course, is out of the\nquestion.\n\n\"Really, I can hardly make myself understand it as far as words and\nphrases are concerned; still, there it is; and now the question arises:\nHaving got this power, as I certainly have, of transferring myself from\none existence to another by a mere effort of thought, because it is very\nevident that this power is really only an extension or an\nexaltation--confound the language of the third dimension--I can't say\nit! Although I understand what it is, it won't go into words. What am I\nto do with it? Its possibilities are, of course, a little\nappalling--that is to say, from the point of view of N3. I have not the\nslightest desire to shake the fabric of Society to pieces, as I could\ndo, and still less have I taste for spending the rest of my scientific\ncareer in what the world would very easily believe to be conjuring\ntricks. I hope I am not going to be another of the unnumbered proofs of\nSolomon's wisdom when he said, 'Whoso getteth knowledge, getteth\nsorrow.' I wonder what sort of advice Her late Majesty of Egypt----\n\n\"Dear me, what nonsense I am talking! Her late Majesty? That won't do at\nall--she has reached the Higher Plane too, so, of course, she can't be\ndead----\"\n\nAnd then with the force of a powerful electric shock, the terrible fact\nstruck him that, for those who had reached that plane, there was no\ndeath! Here was a new light on the weird problem which he had somehow\nbeen called upon to deal with.\n\n\"I wonder what Her Majesty would really think of it?\" he murmured, after\na few moments of mental bewilderment. \"Dear me, who's that?\"\n\nHe looked up, and, to his utter amazement, he saw Queen Nitocris,\narrayed exactly as she had been on that terrible night of her bridal\nwith Menkau-Ra, walking towards him; a perfect incarnation of beauty,\nbut----\n\n\"Oh dear me!\" said the Professor, \"this will never do. Good heavens!\neverybody in Wimbledon knows me, and--well, of course, Her Majesty is\nvery lovely and all that; but what on earth would people think if any\none saw me strolling across the Common in company with an Egyptian\nQueen--to say nothing of the costume--and the image of my own daughter,\ntoo!\"\n\nThe figure approached, and the Queen, dazzlingly and bewilderingly\nbeautiful, held out her hands to him, and their eyes met and they looked\nat each other across the gulf of fifty centuries. Impelled by an\nirresistible impulse coming from whence he knew not, he clasped them in\nhis, and said, apparently by no volition of his own, in the Ancient\nTongue:\n\n\"Ma-Rim[=o]n greets Nitocris, the Queen! What hath he done that he\nshould be once more so highly honoured?\"\n\nAt that moment a carriage came by along the road quite close to them.\nTwo of its occupants were looking straight towards them. They passed\nwithout taking the slightest notice, as they must have done had they\nseen such a marvellous figure as that of the Queen. And then he\nremembered that, unless she willed it, no one in the world of N3 could\nsee her, since it was for her, as it was for him now, to make herself\nvisible or invisible as she chose to pass on to or beyond the lower\nPlane of Existence. These things were quickly becoming more plain to his\ncomprehension, although, as will be readily understood, it was not a\nlesson to be learnt very easily.\n\n\"Welcome, Ma-Rim[=o]n,\" replied the Queen, in a voice which filled him\nwith many distant and strange memories, \"but let there be no talk\nbetween us of honour, for in this state there is neither honour nor\ndishonour, neither ruler nor subject, neither good nor evil, since all\nthese are absorbed in the Perfect Knowledge. Yet it is the will of the\nHigh Gods that I should help thee and guide thee in that new world whose\nthreshold thou hast so lately crossed. It was my hand led thee from the\npath of Light to the path of Darkness, and for that I have paid the\npenalty as well as thou.\n\n\"For many ages, as time is counted in that other world, we have toiled,\nsometimes together, sometimes apart, sometimes in honour, sometimes in\ndishonour, yet ever struggling on to regain the heights which then we\nhad so nearly won. The High Gods permitted me to reach them first, and\ntherefore it was my hand which was stretched out to lead thee across the\nBorder.\n\n\"Now, my message to thee is this: Thou hast powers which no other man\nliving in that lower state possesses; see to it that they be used\nrightly. Forget not that in that other world sin and shame, oppression\nand misery, are as rife as, within the limits of time, they have ever\nbeen. Make it thy concern that the forces of evil shall be weaker and\nnot stronger for the use of these powers to which thou hast attained.\n\n\"We shall meet often in that other world, and that living other-self of\nmine, thy daughter in the flesh and bearer of my name, through every\nmoment of her time-life, I shall watch and guard her, for she,\ntoo--although she knows it not--is approaching the light never seen by\nthe Eye of Flesh, and, though strange things should befall her, it will\nbe for thee in that other state, knowing what thou dost in the Higher\nLife, to help me in this task as in others. Now, farewell, Ma-Rim[=o]n,\"\nshe said, holding out her hands again.\n\nAs he took them, they melted in his grasp, two lustrous eyes looked at\nhim for a moment and grew dim, and he was once more alone on Wimbledon\nCommon.\n\n\"I think I'll be getting home,\" he said, looking at his watch, and he\nturned and walked slowly with bent head and hands clasped behind his\nback to the house.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHE LAW OF SELECTION\n\n\nIn actual mundane time, to use a somewhat halting expression, Professor\nMarmion's walk had occupied about a couple of hours. His strange\nexperiences had, of course, occupied none, since they had taken place\nbeyond the bounds of Time.\n\nMeanwhile, Miss Nitocris had finished her digest of the morning papers,\ngiven the cook a few directions, and then gone out on the lawn at the\nback of the house to have a quiet read and enjoy the soft air and\nsunshine of that lovely May morning. She lay down in a hammock chair in\nthe shade of a fine old cedar at the bottom of the lawn, and began to\nread, and soon she began to dream. The news in the papers, even the most\nresponsible of them, had been very serious. The shadow of war was once\nmore rising in the East--war which, if it came, England could scarcely\nescape, and if it did Someone would have to go and fight in that most\nperilous of all forms of battle, torpedo attack.\n\nThe book she had taken with her was one of exceedingly clever verse\nwritten years before by just such another as herself; a girl, beautiful,\nlearned, and yet absolutely womanly, and endowed, moreover, with that\ngift so rare among learned women, the gift of humour. Long ago, this\ngirl had taken the fever in Egypt, and died of it; but before she died\nshe wrote a book of poems and verses, which, though long forgotten--if\never known--by the multitude, is still treasured and re-read by some,\nand of these Miss Nitocris was one. Just now the book was open at the\nhundred and forty-third page, on which there is a portion of a poem\nentitled _Natural Selection_.\n\nMiss Nitocris' eyes alternately rested on the page for a few moments and\nthen lifted and looked over the lawn towards the open French windows.\nThe verses ran thus:\n\n  _\"But there comes an idealless lad,\n  With a strut, and a stare, and a smirk;\n  And I watch, scientific though sad,\n  The Law of Selection at work._\n\n  _\"Of Science he hasn't a trace,\n  He seeks not the How and the Why,\n  But he sings with an amateur's grace\n  And he dances much better than I._\n\n  _\"And we know the more dandified males\n  By dance and by song win their wives--\n  'Tis a law that with_ Aves _prevails,\n  And even in_ Homo _survives.\"_\n\n\"Just my precious papa's ideas!\" she murmured, with a toss of her head,\nand something like a little sniff. \"What a nuisance it all is!\nAristocracy of intellect, indeed! Just as if any of us, even my dear\nDad, if he _is_ considered one of the cleverest and most learned men in\nEurope, were anything more than what Newton called himself--a little\nchild picking up pebbles and grains of sand on the shore of a boundless\nand fathomless ocean, and calling them knowledge. I'm not quite sure\nthat that's correct, but it's something like it. Still, that's not the\nquestion. How on earth am I to tell poor Mark? Oh dear! he'll have to be\n'Mr Merrill' now, I suppose. What a shame! I've half a mind to rebel,\nand vindicate the Law of Selection at any price. Ah, there he is. Well,\nI suppose I've got to get through it somehow.\"\n\nAs she spoke, one of the French windows under the verandah opened, and a\nman in a panama hat, Norfolk jacket and knickerbockers, came out and\nraised his hat as he stepped off the verandah.\n\nWith a sigh and a frown she closed the book sharply, got up and tossed\nit into the chair. No daintier or more desirable incarnation of the\neternal feminine could have been imagined than she presented as she\nwalked slowly across the lawn to meet the man whom the Law of Selection\nhad designated as her natural mate, and whom her father, for reasons\npresently to be made plain, had forbidden her to marry on pain of exile\nfrom his affections for ever.\n\nThe face he turned towards her as she approached was not exactly\nhandsome as an artist or some women would have defined the word, but it\nwas strong, honest, and open--just the sort of face, in short, to match\nthe broad shoulders, the long, cleanly-shaped, athletic limbs, and the\nfive feet eleven of young, healthy manhood with which Nature had\nassociated it.\n\nA glance at his face and another one at him generally would, in spite of\nthe costume, have convinced any one who knows the genus that Mark\nMerrill was a naval officer. He had that quiet air of restrained\nstrength, of the instinctive habit of command which somehow or other\ndoes not distinguish any other fighting man in the world in quite the\nsame degree. His name and title were Lieutenant-Commander Mark Gwynne\nMerrill, of His Majesty's Destroyer _Blazer_, one of the coolest-headed\nand yet most judiciously reckless officers in the Service.\n\nThere was a light in his wide-set, blue-grey eyes, and a smile on his\nstrong, well-cut lips which were absolutely boyish in their anticipation\nof sheer delight as she approached; and then, after one glance at her\nface, his own changed with a suddenness, which, to a disinterested\nobserver, would have been almost comic.\n\n\"I'm awfully sorry, Mark,\" she began, in a tone which literally sent a\nshiver--a real physical shiver--through him, for he was very, very much\nin love with her.\n\n\"What on earth is the matter, Niti?\" he said, looking at the fair face\nand downcast eyes which, for the first time since he had asked the\neternal question and she had answered it according to his heart's\ndesire, had refused to meet his. \"Let's have it out at once. It's a lot\nbetter to be shot through the heart than starved to death, you know. I\nsuppose it's something pretty bad, or you wouldn't be looking down at\nthe grass like that,\" he continued.\n\n\"Oh, it's--it's--it's a _beastly_ shame, that's what it is, so there!\"\nAnd as she said this Miss Nitocris Marmion, B.Sc., stamped her foot on\nthe turf and felt inclined to burst out crying, just as a milkmaid might\nhave done.\n\n\"Which means,\" said Mark, pulling himself up, as a man about to face a\nmortal enemy would do, \"that the Professor has said 'No.' In other\nwords, he has decided that his learned and lovely daughter shall not, as\nI suppose he would put it, mate with an animal of a lower order--a mere\nfighting-man. Well, Miss Marmion----\"\n\n\"Oh, don't; _please_ don't!\" she exclaimed, almost piteously, dropping\ninto a big wicker armchair by the verandah and putting her hands over\nher eyes.\n\nHe had an awful fear that she was going to cry, and, as the Easterns\nsay, he felt his heart turning to water within him. But her highly\ntrained intellect came to her aid. She swallowed the sob, and looked up\nat him with clear, dry eyes.\n\n\"It isn't quite that, Mark,\" she continued. \"You know I wouldn't stand\nanything like that even from the dear old Dad. Much as I love him, and\neven, as you know, in some senses almost worship him, it isn't that.\nIt's this theory of heredity of his--this scientific faith--bigotry, I\ncall it, for it is just the same to him as Catholicism was to the\nSpaniards in the sixteenth century. In fact, I told him the other night\nthat he reminded me of the Spanish grandee whose daughters were\nconvicted of heresy by the Inquisition, and who showed his devotion to\nthe Church by lighting the faggots which burned them with his own\nhands.\"\n\n\"And what did he say to that?\" said the sailor, not because he wanted to\nknow, but because there was an awkward pause that needed filling.\n\n\"I would rather not tell you, Mark, if you don't mind,\" she said slowly\nand looking very straightly and steadily at him. \"You know--well, I\nneedn't tell you again what I've told you already. You know I care for\nyou, and I always shall, but I cannot--I dare not--disobey my father. I\nowe all that I ever had to him. He has been father, mother, teacher,\nfriend, companion--everything to me. We are absolutely alone in the\nworld. If I could leave him for anybody, I'd leave him for you, but I\nwon't disobey him and break his heart, as I believe I should, even for\nyou.\"\n\n\"You're perfectly right, Niti, perfectly,\" said Commander Merrill, in a\ntone of steady conviction which inspired her with an almost irresistible\nimpulse to get up and kiss him. \"You couldn't honestly do anything else,\nand I know the shortest way to make you hate me would be to ask you to\ndo that something else. But still,\" he went on, thrusting his hands into\nthe pockets of his Norfolk jacket, \"I do think I have a sort of right\nto have some sort of explanation, and with your permission I shall just\nask him for one.\"\n\n\"For goodness' sake, don't do that, Mark--don't!\" she pleaded. \"You\nmight as well go and ask a Jewish Rabbi why he wouldn't let his daughter\nmarry a Christian. Wise and clever as he is in other things, poor Dad is\nsimply a fanatic in this, and--well, if he did condescend to explain,\nI'm afraid you might mistake what he would think the correct scientific\nway of putting it, for an insult, and I couldn't bear to think of you\nquarrelling. You know you're the only two people in the world I--I--Oh\ndear, what _shall_ I do!\"\n\nIt was at this point that the Law of Natural Selection stepped in.\nNatural laws of any sort have very little respect for the refinements of\nwhat mortals are pleased to call their philosophy. Professor Marmion was\na very great man--some men said he was the greatest scientist of his\nage--but at this moment he was but as a grain of sand among the wheels\nof the mighty machine which grinds out human and other destinies.\n\nCommander Merrill took a couple of long, swift strides towards the chair\nin which Nitocris was leaning back with her hands pressed to her eyes.\nHe picked her up bodily, as he might have picked a child of seven up,\nput her protesting hands aside, and slowly and deliberately kissed her\nthree times squarely on the lips as if he meant it; and the third time\nher lips moved too. Then he whispered:\n\n\"Good-bye, dear, for the present, at any rate!\"\n\nAfter which he deposited her tenderly in the chair again, and, with just\none last look, turned and walked with quick, angry strides across the\nlawn and round the semi-circular carriage-drive, saying some things to\nhimself between his clenched teeth, and thinking many more.\n\nA few yards outside the gate he came face to face with the Professor.\n\n\"Good-morning, sir,\" said Merrill, with a motion of his hand towards his\nhat.\n\n\"Oh, good-morning, Mr Merrill,\" replied the Professor a little stiffly,\nfor relations between them had been strained for some considerable time\nnow. \"I presume you have been to the house. I am sorry that you did not\nfind me at home, but if it is anything urgent and you have half an hour\nto spare----\"\n\nHe stopped in his speech, silenced by a shock of something like shame.\nHe was prevaricating. He knew perfectly well that \"it\" was the most\nurgent errand a man could have, next to his duty to his country, that\nhad brought the young sailor to his house. Twenty-four hours ago he\nwould not have noticed such a trifle: but it was no trifle now; for to\nhis clearer vision it was a sin, an evasion of the immutable laws of\nTruth, utterly unworthy of the companion of Nitocris the Queen in that\nother existence which he had just left.\n\n\"You have seen Niti, I suppose?\" he continued, with singular directness.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Merrill. \"You will remember that the week was up this\nmorning, and so I called to learn my fate, and your daughter has told\nme. I presume that your decision is final, and that, therefore, there is\nnothing more to be said on the subject.\"\n\n\"My decisions are usually final, Mr Merrill, because I do not arrive at\nthem without due consideration. I am deeply grieved, as I have told you\nbefore, but my decision is a deduction from what I consider to be an\nunbreakable chain of argument which I need not trouble you with.\nPersonally and socially, of course, it would be impossible for me to\nhave the slightest objection to you. In fact, apart from your execrable\nfighting profession, I like you; but otherwise, as you know, I cannot\nhelp looking at you as the survival of an age of barbarism, a hark-back\nof humanity, for all the honour in which that trade is held by an\nignorant and deluded world; and so for the last time it is my painful\ntask to tell you that there can be no union between your blood and mine.\nOutside that, of course, there is no reason why we should not remain\nfriends.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir,\" replied Merrill, \"I have heard your decision, and Miss\nMarmion has told me she is resolved to abide by it; I should be\nsomething less than a man if I attempted to alter her resolve. We are\nordered on foreign service this week, and so for the present,\ngood-bye.\"\n\nHe lifted his hat, turned away and walked down the road with teeth\nclenched and eyes fixed straight in front of him, and a shade of grey\nunder the tan of his skin.\n\nThe Professor looked after him for a few moments and turned in at the\ngate, saying:\n\n\"It's a great pity in some ways--many ways, in fact. He's a fine young\nfellow and a thorough gentleman, and I'm afraid they're very fond of\neach other, but of course to let Niti marry him would be the negation of\nthe belief and teaching of more than half a lifetime. I hope the poor\ngirl won't take it too keenly to heart. I'm afraid he seems rather hard\nhit, poor chap, but of course there's no help for it. Just fancy me the\nfather-in-law of a fighting man, and the grandfather of what might be a\nbrood of fighters! No, no; that is quite out of the question.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nMOSTLY POSSIBILITIES\n\n\nThe Professor went into the garden feeling just a trifle uncomfortable.\nHe not only loved his daughter dearly, but he also had a very deep and\nwell-justified respect for her intellect and scholarly attainments. Her\nunfortunate love for a man whom he honestly believed to be a totally\nunfit mate for her was the only shadow that had ever drifted between\nthem since she had become, not only his daughter, but his friend and\ncompanion, and the enthusiastic sharer of his intellectual pursuits. Of\ncourse, anything like a scene was utterly out of the question; but there\nis a silence more eloquent than words, and it was that that he was\nmostly afraid of.\n\nHe found her walking up and down the lawn with her hands behind her\nback. She was a little paler than usual, and there was a shadow in her\neyes. She came towards him, and said quite quietly:\n\n\"Mr Merrill has been here, Dad, to say good-bye. I told him, and so we\nhave said it.\"\n\nThe simple words were spoken with a quiet and yet tender dignity which\nmade him feel prouder than ever of his daughter and all the more sorry\nfor her.\n\n\"I met him just outside the gate, Niti,\" he replied, looking at her\nthrough a little mist in his eyes, \"He spoke most honourably, and like\nthe gentleman that he is. I hope you will believe me----\"\n\n\"I believe you in everything, Dad,\" she said quickly; \"and since the\nmatter is ended, it will only hurt us both to say any more about it.\nNow, I have some news,\" she continued, in a tone whose alteration was\nwell assumed.\n\n\"Ah! and what is that, Niti?\" he asked, looking up at her with a smile\nof relief.\n\n\"It's something that I hope you will be able to get some of your solemn\nfun out of. One of the items in the 'Social Intelligence' to-day states\nthat your old friend, Professor Hoskins van Huysman, and his wife and\ndaughter have come to London, and will stay ten days before 'proceeding'\nto Paris and the South of France, and so, of course, they will be here\nfor your lecture, and naturally he will not resist the temptation of\nmaking one of your audience.\"\n\n\"Van Huysman!\" exclaimed the Professor. \"That Yankee charlatan, confound\nhim! I shouldn't wonder if he had the impudence to take part in the\ndiscussion afterwards.\"\n\n\"Then,\" laughed Nitocris, \"you must take care to have all your heavy\nguns ready for action. But, of course, Dad, you won't let your--well,\nyour scientific feelings get mixed up with social matters, will you?\nBecause, you know, I like Brenda very much; she's the prettiest and\nbrightest girl I know. You know, she can do almost anything, and yet\nshe's as unaffected----\"\n\n\"As some one else we know,\" interrupted the Professor with another\nsmile.\n\n\"And then, you know, Mrs van Huysman,\" continued Nitocris with a little\nflush, \"is such a dear, innocent, good-natured thing, so good-hearted\nand so deliciously American. Of course, you can fight with the Professor\nas much as you like in print, and in lecture halls--I know you both love\nit--but you'll still be friends socially, won't you?\"\n\n\"Which, of course, means garden-parties and river trips, and similar\nfrivolities that learned young ladies love so much. You needn't trouble\nabout that, Niti. I shall not allow my zeal for scientific truth to\ninterfere with your social pleasures, you may be quite sure. Science, as\nyou know, has nothing to do with what we call Society, except as one of\nthe most curious phenomena of Sociology. Drive into town whenever you\nlike and see them. Present my respectful compliments, and ask them to\ndinner, or whatever you like. And now I must get to my work--I've only\nthree more days, and my notes are not anything like complete.\"\n\n\"Very well, Dad; I think I'll telephone them--they're stopping at the\nSavoy--extravagant people!--to say that I'll run in this afternoon and\nhave tea. Oh! and, by the way,\" she added, as he turned towards the\nhouse, \"there's another item. Lord Leighton has been called home\nsuddenly on some business, and will be here the day after to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Oh! indeed,\" said the Professor, pausing. \"Well, I shall be delighted\nto see him--but I don't know what I shall have to say to him about that\nMummy.\"\n\nNitocris turned away towards her chair with a faint smile on her lips.\nWith a woman's rapid intuition, she had seen a glimmer of hope in the\nconjunction of these two announcements. Although Professor van Huysman's\npersonal fortune was not as great as his attainments or his fame, Brenda\nwould be very rich, for her mother was the only sister of a widower\nwhose sole interest and occupation in life was piling up dollars. He had\ndollars in everything, from pork and lumber to canned goods, and her own\nfather's scientific inventions, and Brenda was the bright particular\nstar of his affections.\n\nOn the other hand, Lord Leighton, son and heir of the invalid Earl of\nKyneston, was a fairly well-to-do young nobleman, good-looking, a\nscholar, and a good sportsman, who had done brilliantly at Cambridge,\nand then devoted himself to Egyptian exploration with a whole-souled\nardour which had quickly won Professor Marmion's heart, and a ready\nconsent to his \"trying his luck\" with his daughter to boot. This had not\na little to do with the present unfortunate condition of her own love\naffairs.\n\nShe had already refused Lord Leighton, letting him down, of course, as\ngently as possible, but withal firmly and uncompromisingly. Who could\nbetter console him than this beautiful and brilliant American girl, and\nwhat would better suit that lovely head of hers than an English coronet\nwhich was bright with the untarnished traditions of five hundred years?\n\nWherefore, then and there, Miss Nitocris Marmion, Bachelor of Science,\nLicentiate of Literature and Art, and Gold-Medallist in Higher\nMathematics at the University of London, decided upon her first\nexperiment in match-making.\n\nWhen the Professor got into his study and shut the door, there was a\ncurious smiling expression upon his refined, intellectual features.\nInstead of sitting down to his desk, he lit a pipe and began walking up\nand down the room, communing with his own soul in isolated sentences, as\nwas his wont when he was trying to arrive at any difficult decision.\n\nIn order to appreciate his deliberations and their result, it will be\nnecessary to say that Professor Hoskins van Huysman was one of the most\ndistinguished physicists in America, and he had also gained distinction\nin applied mathematics. In addition to this, he was the inventor of many\nmarvellous contrivances for the demonstration and measurement of the\nmore obscure physical forces. His official position was that of Lecturer\nand Demonstrator in Physical Science in Harvard University.\n\nHe and Professor Marmion had been deadly opponents in the field of\ncontroversy for years. The latter had once detected an error in a very\nlearned monograph which he had published in the _Scientific American_ on\nthe \"Co-Relation of the Etheric Forces in the Phenomena of Light and\nHeat,\" and of course he had never forgiven him. From that day forth a\nrelentless duel of wits between them had continued. Every essay,\nmonograph, or book that the one published, the other criticised with\ncold but ruthless severity, to the great delectation of the scientific\nworld, if not to the clarification of its atmosphere.\n\nSocially, they were cordial acquaintances, if not friends. What they\nreally thought of each other was known only to themselves and to their\nimmediate domestic circles.\n\nNaturally Professor Marmion was well aware that his elevation to the\nhigher plane of N4 gave him an enormous advantage over his adversary,\nfor now he could, if he chose, smite him hip and thigh, in a strictly\nscientific sense, and reduce him to utter confusion and public ridicule,\nand the question which he had come to discuss with himself was: In how\nfar, if at all, was he justified in so using the extra-human powers with\nwhich he had been endowed?\n\nThe moment that he began to do this he became conscious of another\ncurious complication of his recent development. On the higher plane he\nhad argued the matter out with no more emotion than a calculating\nmachine would have betrayed, and he had come to a conclusion that was\nabsolutely luminous and just: but now that he came to argue the same\nquestion on the lower plane he found that he was doing it under human\nlimitations, and therefore with human feelings.\n\n\"No,\" he said in the peculiar low, musing tone which was habitual to him\nduring these monologues, \"no; after all, I do not see that there would\nbe any harm in that. Wrong, nay, sinful it would undoubtedly be to prove\nto demonstration that religious, social, and physical laws, may, under\ncertain changing circumstances, be both true and false at the same time.\nI am, or was--or whatever it is--perfectly right in considering that to\ndeliberately produce such a chaos as that would do would be the most\ncolossal crime that a man could commit against humanity, as far as this\nplane is concerned, but there can be no harm in making a few\nmathematical experiments.\"\n\nHe took a few more turns up and down the room, pulling slowly at his\npipe, and with his mind not wholly unoccupied with speculations as to\nwhat Professor Van Huysman's feelings might be if he were watching the\nsaid experiments. Then he began again:\n\n\"At the worst I shall only be carrying certain investigations a few\nsteps farther, and developing theories which have been seriously\ndiscussed by the hardest-headed scholars in the world. Both the Greek\nand the Alexandrian philosophers speculated on the possibility of a\nstate of four dimensions; and didn't Cayley, before this very Society,\ndeliberately say that at the present rate of progress in the Higher\nMathematics, the eye of Intellect might ere long see across the border\nof tri-dimensional space?\n\n\"Surely I cannot do any very great harm by carrying his arguments to\ntheir logical conclusions--if I can. Of course, physical demonstrations\nwould never do: I should frighten my brilliant and learned audience out\nof its seven senses; but, as for mere mathematics--well, I may make them\nstare, and set a good many highly-respected brains--my gifted friend\nHuysman's, among them--working pretty hard. Of course, he will be\nespecially furious, but there's no harm in that either. Yes, I shall\ncertainly do it. If he can't understand my demonstrations, that's not my\nconcern.\"\n\nHe went and sat down at his desk, still smiling, and went very carefully\nthrough the notes he had already made, and then through Professor\nHartley's letter, and his speculations on the Forty-Seventh Proposition.\nThis done, he plunged into a fresh vortex of figures, and symbols, and\ndiagrams, in which he remained for the next two hours, his mind\nhovering, as it were, over the borderland which at once divides and\nunites the higher and the lower planes. When he returned to earth, the\ndreamy, abstracted look faded away from his face; his eyes lit up, and\nthe pleasant smile came back.\n\nHe opened the middle drawer in his desk, and took out the first page of\nthe fair copy of his notes, which Nitocris had made for him--thinking\nthe while how easy it would have been for him in the state of N4 to\ntake it out without opening the drawer at all--and looked at it. It was\nheaded:\n\n\"RECENT PROGRESS IN THE HIGHER MATHEMATICS.\"\n\nHe crossed the title out carefully, and wrote above it:\n\n\"AN EXAMINATION OF SOME SUPPOSED MATHEMATICAL IMPOSSIBILITIES.\"\n\n\"There,\" he murmured, as he put the sheet back; \"I think that such a\ntheme, adequately treated, will considerably astonish my learned friends\nin general, and my esteemed critic, Van Huysman, in particular.\"\n\nFrom which remark it will be gathered that Franklin Marmion had\ncertainly recrossed the dividing line between the two Planes of\nExistence.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nMISS BRENDA ARRIVES, AND PHADRIG THE EGYPTIAN PROPHESIES\n\n\n\"Now, this is just too sweet of you, Niti, to come so soon after we got\nhere. In five minutes more I should have written you a note, asking you\nand the Professor to come and take lunch with us to-morrow, and here\nyou've anticipated me, so we have the pleasure of seeing you all the\nsooner.\"\n\nThese were the words with which Miss Brenda van Huysman greeted Nitocris\nas she entered the drawing-room of the suite of apartments which formed\nher home for the time being in London. I say her home advisedly,\nbecause, although her father and mother also occupied it, she was\nvirtually, if not nominally, mistress undisputed of the splendid\ncamping-place.\n\nShe was an almost perfect type of the highly developed, highly educated\nAmerican girl of to-day, a marvellous compound of intense energy and\nlanguorous grace. She had done as brilliantly at Vassar as Nitocris had\ndone at Girton and London, and she had also rowed stroke in the Ladies'\nEight, and was champion fencer of the College. Yet as far as her\nphysical presence was concerned, she was just a \"Gibson Girl\" of the\ndaintiest type--fair-skinned, blue-eyed, golden-haired--her hair had a\ndarker gleam of bronze in it in certain lights--exquisitely moulded\nfeatures which seemed capable of every sort of expression within a few\nchanging moments, and a poise of head and carriage of body which only\nperfect health and the most scientific physical training can produce. In\na word, she was one of those miraculous developments of femininity which\nNature seems to have made a speciality for the particular benefit of the\nyounger branch of the Anglo-Saxon race. As for her dress--well, the\nshortest and best way to describe that is to say that it exactly suited\nher.\n\nAs she spoke, and their hands met, Mrs van Huysman got up and came\ntowards them, saying:\n\n\"Good afternoon, Miss Marmion. We were real glad to get your 'phone, and\nit's good to see you again. How's the Professor? Too busy to come with\nyou, I suppose, as usual. We see he's going to lecture before the Royal\nSociety on the tenth, and I reckon we shall all be there to listen to\nhim. I shouldn't wonder but there'll be trouble as usual between him and\nmy husband. It seems a pity that two such clever men should waste so\nmuch time in scrapping over these scientific things, which don't seem to\nmatter half a cent, anyhow.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" laughed Nitocris, as they shook hands. \"You see, Mrs\nvan Huysman, _they_ do think it matters a great deal, and, besides, I'm\nquite sure that they both enjoy it very thoroughly. It's their way of\ntaking recreation, you see, just as a couple of pitmen will try and\npound one another to pieces, just for the fun of the thing. It's only a\ncase of intellectual fisticuffs, after all.\"\n\n\"Why, certainly,\" said Brenda, as she rang for tea; \"I'm just sure that\nPoppa never has such a good time as when he thinks he's tearing one of\nProfessor Marmion's theories into little pieces and dancing on them, and\nI shouldn't wonder if Professor Marmion didn't feel about the same.\"\n\n\"I dare say he does,\" said Nitocris, remembering what had happened in\nthe morning; \"it's only one of the thousand unexplained puzzles of human\nnature. As you know, my father hates fighting in the physical sense with\na hatred which is almost fanatical, and yet, when it comes to a battle\nof wits, he's like a schoolboy in a football match.\"\n\n\"It's just another development of the same thing,\" said Brenda. \"Man was\nborn a fighting animal, and I guess he'll remain one till the end of\ntime; and with all our progress in civilisation and science, and all\nthat, the man who doesn't enjoy a fight of some sort isn't of very much\naccount. Now, here's tea, which is just now a more interesting subject.\nSit down, and we'll talk about vanities. I'm just perishing to see what\nRegent Street and Bond Street are like. I don't think I've spent ten\ndollars in London yet. I'm twenty-two to-morrow, Niti, and my\ngrandfather, who is just about the best grandfather a girl ever had,\ncabled across to the Napier people, and they've sent round the dandiest\nsix-cylinder, thirty-horse landaulette that you ever saw, even in\nCentral Park, and a driver to match--only I shan't have much use for\nhim, except to look after the automobile. I'll run you round in her\nafter tea, and you can reintroduce me to the stores--I mean shops; I\nforgot we were in London.\"\n\nMrs van Huysman, as usual, took a back seat while her daughter dispensed\ntea, and did most of the talking. She was a lady of moderate\nproportions, and, unlike a good many American women, she had kept her\ngood looks until very close on fifty. She was full of shrewd common\nsense, but she had been born in a different generation and in a\ndifferent grade of life, and therefore her attire inclined rather to\nmagnificence than to elegance, in spite of her daughter's restraining\nhand and frankly expressed counsel. She had a profound respect for her\nhusband's attainments without in the least understanding them, and she\nvery naturally held an unshakable belief that no quite ordinary woman,\nas she called herself, had ever been miraculously blessed with such a\ndaughter as she had.\n\nNitocris was just beginning her second cup of tea when the door opened\nand her father's foeman in the arena of Science came in. He was the very\nantithesis of Professor Marmion; a trifle below middle height,\nsquare-shouldered and strongly built, with thick, iron-grey hair, and\nsomewhat heavy features which would have been almost commonplace but for\nthe broad, square forehead above them, and the brilliant steel-grey\neyes which glittered restlessly under the thick brows, and also a\ncertain sensitiveness about the nostrils and lips which seemed curiously\nout of keeping with the strength of the lower jaw. His whole being\nsuggested a combination of restless energy and inflexible determination.\nIf he had not been one of America's greatest scientists, he would\nprobably have been one of her most ruthless and despotic Dollar Lords.\n\n\"Ah, Miss Marmion, good afternoon! Pleased to see you,\" he said\nheartily, as Nitocris got up and held out her hand. \"Very kind of you to\nlook us up so soon. How's the Professor? Well, I hope. I see he's\nscheduled for a lecture before the Royal Society. He's got something\nstartling to tell us about, I hope. It's some time since we had anything\nof a scientific scrap between us.\"\n\n\"And therefore,\" said Nitocris, as she took his hand, \"I suppose you are\njust dying for another one.\"\n\n\"Well, not quite dying,\" laughed the Professor. \"Don't look half dead,\ndo I? Just curious, that's all. You can't give me any idea of the\nsubject, I suppose?\"\n\n\"I could, Professor,\" she replied, with a malicious twinkle in her eye,\nbecause she had already had a talk with her father on the altered title\nof the lecture, \"but if I did, you know, I should only, as we say in\nEngland, be spoiling sport. However, I don't think I shall be playing\ntraitor if I tell you to prepare for a little surprise.\"\n\nProfessor van Huysman's manner changed instantly, and the warrior soul\nof the scientist was in arms.\n\n\"Oh yes! A surprise, eh?\" he said, with something between a snort and a\nsnarl in his voice. \"Then I guess----\"\n\n\"Poppa, sit down and have some tea,\" said his daughter, quietly but\nfirmly.\n\nHe sat down without a word, took his cup of tea and a slice of bread and\nbutter; listened in silence as long as he could bear the entirely\nfeminine conversation on a subject in which he hadn't the remotest\ninterest, and then he put his cup down with a little jerk, got up with a\nbigger one, and said, holding out his hand to Miss Nitocris:\n\n\"Well, Miss Marmion, I shall have to say good afternoon. You see we've\nonly just reached this side, and I've got quite a lot of things to\nattend to. Bring your father along to dinner to-morrow night, if you\ncan; I shall be glad to meet him again. You needn't be afraid: we shan't\nshoot.\"\n\nWhen he had gone, Brenda rang and ordered the motor-car to be ready in\nhalf an hour. Then they finished their tea and talk, and Brenda and\nNitocris went and put on their wraps--not the imitation of the medi\u00e6val\narmour which is used for serious motor-driving, but just dust-cloaks and\nmushrooms, both of which Brenda lent to her friend. As they came back\nthrough the drawing-room, she said to her mother:\n\n\"Well, Mamma, the car's ready, I believe. Won't you join us in a little\nrun round town?\"\n\n\"When I want to take a run into the Other World in one of those infernal\nmachines of yours, Brenda,\" said her mother, with a mild touch of\nsarcasm in her tone, \"I'll ask you to let me come. This afternoon I feel\njust a little bit too comfortable for a journey like that.\"\n\n\"It's a curious thing,\" said Brenda, as they were going down in the\nlift, \"Mamma's as healthy a woman as ever lived, and she's American too,\nand yet I believe she'd as soon get on top of a broncho as into an\nautomobile.\"\n\nThe car was waiting for them in the courtyard under the glass awning. A\nsmart-looking young _chauffeur_ in orthodox costume touched his cap and\nset the engine going. The gold-laced porters handed them into the two\nfront seats, and the _chauffeur_ effaced himself in the _tonneau_. Miss\nBrenda put one hand on the steering-wheel and the other on the first\nspeed lever, and the car slid away, as though it had been running on\nice, towards the great arched entrance.\n\nAs they turned to the left on their way westward, a shabbily dressed man\nand woman stepped back from the roadway on to the pavement. For a moment\nthey stared at the car in mute astonishment; then the man gripped the\nwoman tightly by the arm and led her away out of the ever-passing\nthrong, whispering to her in Coptic:\n\n\"Did'st thou see her, Neb-Anat--the Queen--the Queen in the living flesh\nsitting there in the self-mover, the devil-machine? To what unholy\nthings has she come--she, the daughter of the great Rameses! But it may\nbe that she is held in bondage under the spell of the evil powers that\ncreated these devil-chariots which pant like souls in agony and breathe\nwith the breath of Hell. She must be rescued, Neb-Anat.\"\n\n\"Rescued?\" echoed the woman, in a tone that was half scorn and half\nfear. \"Is it so long ago that thou hast forgotten how we tried to rescue\nher mummy from the hands of these infidels? Now, behold, she is alive\nagain, living in the midst of this vast, foul city of the infidels,\nclothed after the fashion of their women, and yet still beautiful and\nsmiling. Pent-Ah, didst thou not even see her laugh as she rode past us?\nAlas! I tell thee that our Queen is laid under some awful spell,\ndoubtless because she has in some way incurred the displeasure of the\nHigh Gods, and if that is so, not even the Master himself could rescue\nher. What, then, shall we do?\"\n\n\"Thy saying is near akin to blasphemy, Neb-Anat,\" he murmured in reply,\n\"and yet there may be a deep meaning in it. Nevertheless, to-night, nay,\nthis hour, the Master must know of what we have seen.\"\n\nThey walked along, conversing in murmurs, as far as Waterloo Bridge,\nthen they turned and crossed it and walked down Waterloo Road into the\nBorough Road, and then turned off into a narrow, grimy street which\nended in a small court whose three sides were formed of wretched houses,\nupon which many years of misery, poverty, and crime had set their\nunmistakable stamp. They crossed the court diagonally and entered a\nhouse in the right-hand corner. They went up the worn, carpetless stairs\nwith a rickety handrail on one side and the torn, peeling paper on the\nother, and stopped before a door which opened on to a narrow landing on\nthe first floor. Pent-Ah knocked with his knuckles on the panel, first\nthree times quickly, and then twice slowly. Then came the sound of the\ndrawing of a bolt, and the door opened.\n\nThey went in with shuffling feet and crouching forms, and the woman\nclosed the door behind her. A tall, gaunt, yellow-skinned man, his head\nperfectly bald and the lower part of his face covered with a heavy white\nbeard and moustache, faced them. His clothing was half Western, half\nOriental. A pair of thin, creased, grey tweed trousers met, or almost\nmet, a pair of Turkish slippers, showing an inch of bare, lean ankle in\nbetween. His body was covered with a dirty yellow robe of fine woollen\nstuff, whose ragged fringe reached to his knees, and a faded red scarf\nwas folded twice round his neck, one end hanging down his breast and the\nother down his back. As Pent-Ah closed the door and bolted it, he said\nto him in Coptic:\n\n\"So ye have returned! What news of the Queen? For without that surely ye\nwould not have dared to come before me.\"\n\nHe spoke the words as a Pharaoh might have spoken them to a slave, and\nas though the bare, low-ceiled, shabby room, with its tawdry Oriental\ncurtains and ornaments, had been an audience-chamber in the palace of\nPepi in old Memphis, for this was he who had once been Anemen-Ha, High\nPriest of Ptah, in the days when Nitocris was Queen of the Two Kingdoms.\n\n\"We have seen her once more, Lord,\" said Pent-Ah, \"scarce an hour ago,\ndressed after the fashion of these heathen English, and seated in a\ndevil-chariot beside another woman, as fair almost as she. It is true,\nLord, even as we said, that our Lady the Queen is in the flesh again,\nand yet she knows us not. It may be that the High Gods have laid some\nspell upon her.\"\n\n\"Spell or no spell, the mission which is ours is the same,\" was the\nreply. \"It is plain that a miracle has been worked. The Mummy which\nwe--I as well as you--were charged to recover and restore to its\nresting-place, has vanished. The Queen has returned to live yet another\nlife in the flesh, but the command remains the same. Mummy or woman, she\nshall be taken back to her ancient home to await the day when the Divine\nAssessors shall determine the penalty of her guilt. The task will be\nhard, yet nothing is impossible to those who serve the High Gods\nfaithfully. Ye have done well to bring me this news promptly. Here is\nmoney to pay for your living and your work. Watch well and closely. Know\nevery movement that the Queen makes, and every day inform me by word or\nin writing of all her actions. On the fourth day from now come here an\nhour before midnight. Now go.\"\n\nHe counted out five sovereigns to Pent-Ah. Their glitter contrasted\nstrangely with the shabby squalor of the room and the poverty of his own\ndress, but he gave them as though they had been coppers. Pent-Ah took\nthem with a low obeisance, and dropped them one by one into a pocket in\na canvas belt which he wore under his ragged waistcoat. Neb-Anat looked\nat them greedily as they disappeared.\n\n\"The Master's commands shall be obeyed, and the High Gods shall be\nfaithfully served,\" said Pent-Ah, as he straightened himself up again.\n\"From door to door the Queen shall be watched, and, if it be permitted,\nNeb-Anat shall become her slave, and so the watch shall be made closer.\nIs not that so, Neb-Anat?\"\n\n\"The will of the Master is the law of his slave,\" she replied, sinking\nalmost to her knees.\n\n\"It is enough,\" replied the Master, who was known to the few who knew\nhim as Phadrig Amena, a Coptic dealer in ancient Egyptian relics and\ncurios in a humble way of business. \"Serve faithfully, both of you, and\nyour reward shall not be wanting. Farewell, and the peace of the High\nGods be on you.\"\n\nWhen they had gone he sat down to the old bureau, took out a sheaf of\npapers, some white and new, others yellow-grey with age, and yet others\nwhich were sheets of the ancient papyrus. The writing on these was in\nthe old Hermetic character; of the rest some were in cursive Greek and\nsome in Coptic. A few only were in English, and about half a dozen in\nRussian. He read them all with equal ease, and although he knew their\ncontents almost by heart, he pored over them for a good half-hour with\nscarcely so much as a movement of his lips. Then he put them away and\nlocked the drawer with one of a small bunch of curiously shaped keys\nwhich were fastened round his waist by a chain. When he had concealed\nthem in his girdle, he got up and began to pace the floor of the\nmiserable room with long, stately, silent steps as though the dirty,\ncracked, uneven boards had been the gleaming squares of alternate black\nand white marble of the floor of the Sanctuary in the now ruined Temple\nof Ptah in old Memphis. Then, after a while, with head thrown proudly\nback and hands clasped behind him, he began to speak in the Ancient\nTongue, as though he were addressing some invisible presence.\n\n\"Yes, truly the Powers of Evil and Darkness have conquered through many\ngenerations of men, but the days of the High Gods are unending, and the\nclimax of Fate is not yet. Not yet, O Nitocris, is the murderous crime\nof thy death-bridal forgotten. The souls of those who died by thy hand\nin the banqueting chamber of Pepi still call for vengeance out of the\nglooms of Amenti. The thirst of hate and the hunger of love are still\nunslaked and unsatisfied. I, Phadrig, the poor trader, who was once\nAnemen-Ha, hate thee still, and the Russian warrior-prince, who was once\nMenkau-Ra, shall love thee yet again with a love as fierce as that of\nold, and so, if the High Gods permit, between love and hate shalt thou\npass to the doom that thou hast earned.\"\n\nHe paused in his walk and stood staring blankly out of the grimy little\nwindow with eyes which seemed to see through and beyond the\nsmoke-blackened walls of the wretched houses opposite, and away through\nthe mists of Time to where a vast city of temples and palaces lay under\na cloudless sky beside a mighty slow-flowing river, and his lips began\nto move again as those of a man speaking in a dream:\n\n\"O Memphis, gem of the Ancient Land and home of a hundred kings, how is\nthy grandeur humbled and thy glory departed! Thy streets and broad\nplaces which once rang with the tramp of mighty hosts and echoed with\nthe songs of jubilant multitudes welcoming them home from victory are\nburied under the drifting desert sands; in the ruins of thy holy temples\nthe statues of the gods lie prone in the dust, and the owl rears her\nbrood on thy crumbling altars, and hoots to the moon where once rose the\nsolemn chant of priests and the sweet hymns of the Sacred Virgins; the\njackal barks where once the mightiest monarchs of earth gave judgment\nand received tribute; thy tombs are desecrated, and the mummies of kings\nand queens and holy men have been ravished from them to adorn the\nunconsecrated halls of the museums of ignorant infidels; the heel of the\nheathen oppressor has stamped the fair flower of thy beauty into the\ndeep dust of defilement. Alas, what great evil have the sons and\ndaughters of Khem wrought that the High Gods should have visited them\nwith so sore a judgment! How long shall thy bright wings lie folded and\nidle, O Necheb, Bringer of Victory?\"\n\nA deep sigh came from his heaving breast as he turned away and began his\nwalk again. Soon he spoke again, but now in a changed voice from which\nthe note of exaltation had passed away:\n\n\"But it is of little use to brood over the lost glories of the past. Our\nconcern is with that which is and that which may--nay, shall be. Who is\nthis Franklin Marmion, this wise man of the infidels? Who is he, and who\nwas he--since, by the changeless law of life and death, each man and\nwoman is a deathless soul which passes into the shadows only to return\nre-garbed in the flesh to live and work through the interlocked cycles\nof Eternal Destiny? Was he--ah Gods! was _he_ once Ma-Rim[=o]n, whose\nfootsteps in the days that are dead approached so nearly to the\nthreshold of the Perfect Knowledge, while mine, doubtless for the sin of\nmy longing for mere earthly power and greatness, were caught and held\nback in a web of my own weaving? And, if so, has he attained while I\nhave lost?\n\n\"What if that strange tale which Pent-Ah and Neb-Anat told me of their\nvisit to his house--told, as I thought, to hide their failure under a\nveil of lies--was true? If so, then he has passed the threshold and\ntaken a place only a little lower than the seats of the gods, a place\nthat I may not approach, barred by the penalty of my accursed folly and\npride! Ah well, be it so or be it not, are not the fates of all men in\nthe hands of the High Gods who see all things? We see but a little, and\nthat little, with their help, we must do according to the faith and the\nhope that is in us.\"\n\nAt this moment there came a knock at the door. It opened at his bidding,\nand a dirty-faced, ragged-frocked little girl shuffled into the room\nholding out a letter in her hard, grimy, claw-like hand.\n\n\"'Ere's somethin' as has just come for you, Mister Phadrig. Muvver told\nme ter bring it up, and wot'll yer want for supper, and will yer give me\nthe money?\" she said in a piping monotone, still holding out her hand\nafter he had taken the letter. He gave her sixpence, saying:\n\n\"Two eggs and some bread. I will make my coffee myself.\"\n\nShe took the coin and shuffled out quickly, for she went not a little in\nawe of this dark-faced foreign man from mysterious regions beyond her\nken, who was doubtless a magician of some sort, and could kill her or\nchange her into a rat by just breathing on her, if he wanted to.\n\nMeantime Nitocris and Brenda were having what the latter called \"a\nperfectly lovely time\" in Regent Street and Bond Street and other\npurlieus of that London paradise which the genius of commerce has\ncreated for the delight of his richest and most lavish-handed votaries.\nBrenda spent her ten dollars and a few thousands more, and then, as it\nwas getting on to dinner-time and Nitocris absolutely refused to let her\nfather eat his meal alone, she ran her out to Wimbledon at a speed for\nwhich a mere man would have inevitably been fined, asked herself to\ndinner, and made herself entirely delightful to the Professor.\n\nBut in spite of all her cunning wiles and winning ways she left in\nabsolute ignorance of the subject of the forthcoming lecture.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\"THE WILDERNESS,\" WIMBLEDON COMMON\n\n\nThe little estate on Wimbledon Common, which had been in Professor\nMarmion's family for three generations, was called \"The Wilderness.\" The\nhouse was of distinctly composite structure. Tradition said that it had\nbeen a royal hunting lodge in the days when Barnes and Putney and\nWimbledon were tiny hamlets and the Thames flowed silver-clear through a\nvast, wild region of forest and gorse and heather, and the ancestors of\nthe deer in Richmond Park browsed in the shade of ancient oaks and elms\nand beeches, and antler-crowned monarchs sent their hoarse challenges\nbellowing across the open spaces which separated their jealously guarded\ndomains.\n\nGeneration by generation it had grown with the wealth and importance of\nits owners, as befits a house that is really a home and not merely a\nplace to live in, until it had become a quaint medley of various styles\nof architecture from the Elizabethan to the later Georgian. Thus it had\ncome to possess a charm that was all its own, a charm that can never\nbelong to a house that has only been built, and has not grown. Its\ninterior was an embodiment in stone and oak and plaster of cosy comfort\nand dignified repose, and, though it contained every \"modern\nimprovement,\" all was in such perfect taste and harmony that even the\nelectric light might have been installed in the days of the first James.\n\nThe Professor inhabited the northern wing, reputed to have been the\noriginal lodge in which kings and queens and great soldiers and\nstatesmen had held revel after the chase, and tradition had endowed it\nwith a quite authentic ghost: which was that of a fair maiden who had\nbeen decoyed thither to become the victim of royal passion, and who,\nstrangely enough, poisoned herself in her despair, instead of getting\nherself made a duchess and founding the honours of a noble family on her\nown dishonour.\n\nAlthough, as I have said, quite authentic, for the Professor had seen\nher so often that he had come to regard her with respectful friendship,\nthe Lady Alicia was not quite an orthodox ghost. She did not come at\nmidnight and wail in distressing fashion over the scene of her sad and\nshameful death. She seemed to come when and where she listed, whether in\nthe glimpses of the moon or the full sunlight of mid-day. She never\npassed beyond the limits of the old lodge, and never broke the silence\nof her coming and goings. None of the present inhabitants of \"The\nWilderness\" had seen her save the Professor, but Nitocris had often\nshivered with a sudden chill when she chanced to be in her invisible\npresence, and at such times she would often say to her father:\n\n\"There is something cold in the room, Dad. I suppose your friend the\nLady Alicia is paying you a visit. I _do_ wish she would allow me to\nmake her acquaintance.\"\n\nAnd to this he would sometimes reply with perfect gravity:\n\n\"Yes, she has just come in: she is standing by the window yonder.\" And\nthis had happened so often that Nitocris, like her father, had come to\nregard the wraith, or astral body, as the Professor deemed it, of the\nunhappy lady almost as a member of the family. Of course, after he had\npassed the border into the realm of N4, Franklin Marmion speedily came\nto look upon her visits as the merest commonplaces.\n\nBut as the unhappy Lady Alicia will have no part to play in the action\nof this narrative, her little story must be accepted as a perhaps\nexcusable digression.\n\nThere were about four acres of comfortably wooded land about the house,\nof which nearly an acre had formed the pleasaunce of the old lodge. This\nwas now a beautifully-kept modern garden, with a broad, gently-sloping\nlawn, whose turf had been growing more and more velvety year by year for\nover three centuries, and divided from it by a low box-hedge was\nanother, levelled up and devoted to tennis and new-style croquet. The\nOld Lawn, as it was called, sloped away from a broad verandah which ran\nthe whole length of the central wing and formed the approach to the big\ndrawing-room and dining-room, and a cosy breakfast-room of early\nGeorgian style, and these, with her study and \"snuggery\" and bedroom on\nthe next floor, formed the peculiar domain of Miss Nitocris.\n\nShe and the Professor were just sitting down to an early breakfast on\nthe morning of the garden-party, which had been arranged for the day but\none after the arrival of the Huysmans, when the post came in. There were\na good many letters for both, for each had many interests in life. The\nProfessor only ran his eye over the envelopes and then put the bundle\naside for consideration in the solitude of his own den. Nitocris did the\nsame, picked one out and left the others for similar treatment after she\nhad interviewed the cook about lunch and refreshments for the afternoon,\nand the butler on the subject of cooling drinks, for it promised to be a\nperfect English day in June--which is, of course, the most delicious day\nthat you may find under any skies between the Poles.\n\nShe opened the one she had selected and skimmed its contents. Then her\neyelids lifted, and she said:\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\n\"What is the matter, Niti?\" asked her father, looking up from his\ncutlet. \"Nothing gone wrong with your arrangements, I hope.\"\n\n\"Oh dear, no,\" she replied, with something like exultation in her voice,\n\"quite the reverse, Dad. This is from Brenda, and Brenda is an angel\ndisguised in petticoats and picture hats. Listen.\"\n\nThen she began to read:\n\n     \"MY DEAREST NITI,--I am going to take what I'm afraid\n     English people would think a great liberty. The trouble is this:\n     When the Professor (mine, I mean) was making his tour of the\n     Russian Universities two years ago, he received a great deal of\n     courtesy and help from no less a person than the celebrated Prince\n     Oscar Oscarovitch--the modern Skobeleff, you know--who was very\n     interested in Poppa's work, and took a lot of trouble to smooth\n     things out for him. Well, the Prince, as of course you know, is in\n     London now. He called yesterday, and when I mentioned your party,\n     he said he was very sorry he had not the honour of your father's\n     acquaintance as well as mine. The grammar's a bit wrong there, but\n     you know what I mean. That, of course, meant that he wants to come;\n     and, to be candid, I should like to bring him, for even an American\n     girl here doesn't always get a Prince, and a famous man as well, to\n     take around, so, as the time is so short, may we include him in our\n     party? If you have forgiven me and are going to say 'yes,' I must\n     tell you that the Prince would like to compensate for his\n     intrusion--that's the way he puts it--by helping entertain your\n     guests. It seems that he has met with a man who can work miracles,\n     an Egyptian----\"\n\nAt this point Professor Marmion looked up again suddenly with an almost\nimperceptible start, and, for the first time, took an interest in Miss\nHuysman's letter.\n\n     \"----named Phadrig. The Prince assures me that he is not a\n     conjurer in the professional sense, and would be deeply insulted\n     to be called one; also that no amount of money would induce him to\n     give a display of his powers just _for_ money. He will come to-day,\n     if you like, and do wonderful things, which, from what the Prince\n     says, will astonish and perhaps frighten us a bit, but only because\n     the Prince once saved his life and got him out of a very bad place\n     he had got into with a Turkish Pascha. Now, that is my little\n     story. Please 'phone me as soon as you can so that I can let the\n     Prince know. It will be just too sweet of you and the Professor to\n     say 'yes.'\n\n      --Your devoted chum,                                    BRENDA.\"\n\n\n\"Well, Dad,\" she asked, as she put the letter down, \"what do you say?\"\n\n\"Just what you want to say, my dear Niti,\" he replied, carefully\nspreading some marmalade on a triangle of toast \"Personally, I must\nconfess that I should rather like to see some of this so-called\nmagician's alleged magic. I know that some of these fellows are\nextraordinarily clever, and I have no doubt that he will show us\nsomething interesting, if you care to see it.\"\n\n\"Then that settles it,\" said Nitocris, rising; \"I will go and ring up\nthe Savoy at once. Perhaps the Egyptian gentleman might be able to help\nyou with that Forty-Seventh Proposition problem of Professor Hartley's.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" answered Franklin Marmion drily, and went on with his\nbreakfast.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nTHE STAGE FILLS\n\n\nThe party which gradually assembled on the lawn about four was somewhat\nsmall, but very select. Nitocris had too much common sense and too much\nreal consideration for her friends and acquaintances to get together a\nmere mob of well-dressed people of probably incompatible tastes and\ntemperament, and call it a party. She disliked an elbowing crowd and a\nclatter of fashionably shrill tongues with all the aversion of a\ndelicately developed sensibility. No consideration of rank or social\npower or wealth had the slightest weight with her when she was\ndistributing cards of invitation, wherefore the said cards were all the\nmore eagerly awaited by those who did, and did not, get them. The result\nof this in the present case was that, although every one accepted and\ncame, rather less than fifty people had the run of the broad lawns and\nthe leafy wilderness about them on that momentous afternoon.\n\nThe first of the arrivals was Professor Hartley, reputed to be the\ngreatest mathematician in England. He was a large man with rather heavy\nfeatures, lit up by alert grey eyes, a big, dome-like cranium, and a\nmanner that was modest almost to diffidence. He brought his wife, a\nslim and somewhat stern-featured lady, who, in the domestic sense, kept\nhim in his place with inflexible decision, and worshipped him in his\nprofessional capacity, and two pretty, well-dressed, and obviously\nwell-bred daughters. Their carriage drew up, turned into the drive\nprecisely at four. Punctuality was the Professor's one and only social\nvice.\n\nNext came Commander Merrill in a hansom. This would be one of the very\nfew meetings that he could hope for with his lost beloved--as he now\nsadly thought of her--before he put H.M.S. _Blazer_ into commission, and\nso punctuality on his part was both natural and excusable. Then came a\nfew more carriages containing very nice people with whom we have here\nbut little concern; and then Miss Brenda, deeply regretting her\nbeautiful Napier, with her father and mother in a very smart Savoy\nturn-out followed by a coronetted brougham drawn by a splendid pair of\nblack Orloffs. This was followed by an equally smart dog-cart driven by\na rather slightly-built but well set-up young man with a light\nmoustache, bronzed skin, and brilliant blue eyes. He was good-looking,\nbut if his features had been absolutely plain he could never have looked\ncommonplace, for this was Lord Lester Leighton, son of the Earl of\nKyneston, and twenty generations of unblemished descent had made him the\naristocrat that he was.\n\nNitocris did not like pompous announcements by servants, and so she\nreceived her guests, who were all acquaintances or friends, in the\ngreat porch through which many a brilliant presence had passed, and had\ntwo maids waiting inside to see to the wants of the ladies, and their\nown coachman and a couple of grooms to attend to matters outside.\n\nMerrill was made as happy as possible by a bright smile, a real\nhand-clasp instead of the usual Society paw-waggle, and instructions to\ngo and make himself agreeable and useful. Brenda also received a hearty\n\"shake\"--Nitocris did not believe in kissing in public--and when the\nProfessor and Mrs Huysman had gone in, she whispered:\n\n\"I suppose that's the Prince's brougham. You must wait here, dear, and\ndo the introductions. You're responsible, you know.\"\n\nBrenda assented with a nod and a smile, as the brougham drew up and the\nsmart tiger jumped down and opened the door. The Prince got out, and was\nfollowed by Phadrig the Adept. As she looked at the two men, Nitocris\nfelt as though a wave of cold air had suddenly enveloped her whole\nbeing--body and soul.\n\n\"Niti, this is our friend, Prince Oscar Oscarovitch, whom you have been\nkind enough to let me invite by proxy. Prince, this is Miss Nitocris\nMarmion.\"\n\nOf course all the world knew of Oscar Oscarovitch, the modern Skobeleff,\nthe lineal descendant of Ivan the Terrible, the crystal-brained,\nsteel-willed man who was to be the saviour and regenerator of\nhalf-ruined, revolution-rent Russia, but this was the first time that\nNitocris had met him in her present life. When she had returned his\nstately bow, she looked up and saw with a strange intuition, which\nsomehow seemed half-reminiscent an almost perfect type of the primitive\nwarrior through the disguise of his faultless twentieth-century attire.\nHe was nearly two inches over six feet, but he was so exquisitely\nproportioned that he looked less than his height. His skin was fair and\nsmooth, but tanned to an olive-brown. His forehead was of medium height,\nstraight and square, with jet-black brows drawn almost straight across\nit above a pair of rather soft, dreamy eyes that were blue or black\naccording to the mood of their possessor. His nose was strong and\nslightly curved, with delicately sensitive nostrils. A dark glossy\nmoustache and beard trimmed _\u00e0 la_ Tsar, partly hid full, almost sensual\nlips and a powerful somewhat projecting chin.\n\nAs their eyes met the shiver of revulsion passed through her again. She\nhardly heard his murmured compliments, but her attention awoke when he\nturned to the man who was standing behind him, and said with a very\ngraceful gesture of his left hand:\n\n\"Miss Marmion, this is the gentleman whom you have so graciously\npermitted me to bring to your house. This is Phadrig the Adept, as he is\nknown in his own ancient land of Egypt, a worker of wonders which really\nare wonders, and not mere sleight-of-hand conjuring tricks. He has been\ngood enough to accompany me in order to convince the learned of the West\nthat the Immemorial East could still teach it something if it chose.\"\n\nNitocris bowed, and as she looked at the figure which now stood beside\nthe Prince, she shivered again. She had a swift sense of standing in the\npresence of implacable enemies, and yet she had never seen these men\nbefore, and, for all she knew, she had not an enemy in the world. She\nwas intensely relieved when Lord Lester Leighton came up and held out\nhis hand, and she was able to ask the Prince and his companion to go\nthrough to the lawn.\n\nNo one would have recognised the shabby denizen of the grimy room in\nCandler's Court, Borough High Street, in the tall, dignified Eastern\ngentleman who walked with slow and stately step through the spacious old\nhall of \"The Wilderness.\" He was clad in a light frock-coat suit of\nirreproachable cut and fit. The correctly-creased trousers met\nbrightly-burnished, narrow-toed tan boots; a black-tasselled scarlet\ntarbush was set square on his high forehead, and the dark red tie under\nhis two-ply collar just added the necessary touch of Oriental colour to\nhis costume, and went excellently with the lighter red of the tarbush.\nIt is hardly necessary to say that when he and the Prince went out on to\nthe lawn, they were, as a Society paper report of the function would\nhave put it, \"the observed of all observers.\"\n\n\"I'm so glad you were able to be here in time for my little party, Lord\nLeighton,\" said Nitocris, when she had ended the welcoming of the other\nguests. \"Dad will be delighted, too----\"\n\nShe stopped rather suddenly, remembering that Dad would have to tell his\nyoung friend the sad story of the mysterious loss of the Mummy; but\nanother subject was uppermost in her mind just then, and, taking refuge\nin it, she went on quickly:\n\n\"Come along to the lawn. I want to introduce you to a very distinguished\ngentleman--and his wife and daughter. No less a person, my lord, than\nthe great Professor Hoskins van Huysman!\"\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed Leighton, with a laugh that was almost boyish for such\na serious and learned young man. \"_The_ Huysman: the Professor's most\ndoughty antagonist in the arena of symbols and theorems? Oh, now that\n_is_ good!\"\n\n\"Yes; I think you will find him very interesting,\" replied Nitocris,\nhoping in her soul that he would find Brenda a great deal more\ninteresting. \"Come along, or Dad will be beginning to think that I am\nneglecting my duties, and I must be on quite my best behaviour to-day.\nWe are favoured by the presence of another very celebrated celebrity\nto-day. That tall man who came in just before you was Prince Oscar\nOscarovitch.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" he said lightly; \"I recognised the brute.\"\n\n\"The brute? Dear me, that is rather severe. Then you know His Highness?\"\nshe asked in a low, almost eager, voice.\n\n\"There are not many men in the Near or Far East who have not some cause\nto know His Highness,\" he replied in a serious tone, tinged by the\nsuspicion of a sneer. \"He is about the finest specimen of the\nwell-veneered savage that even Russia has produced for the last\ncentury. He is a brilliant scholar, statesman, and soldier; delightful\namong his equals--or those he chooses to consider so--charming to men,\nand, they say, almost irresistible to women; but to his opponents and\nhis inferiors, a pitiless brute-beast without heart, or soul, or honour.\nA curious mixture: but that's the man.\"\n\n\"How awful!\" murmured Nitocris. \"Fancy a man like that being in such a\nposition!\"\n\nBut, although she did not understand why, she had heard his\nharshly-spoken words with a positive sense of relief. They exactly\ntranslated and crystallised her first inexplicable feelings of desperate\naversion--almost of terror.\n\nShe led Leighton to a little group on the left side of the lawn,\ncomposed of the three Professors and the wives and daughters of two of\nthem. As they approached them, Nitocris became sensible of a curious\nkind of nervousness. She did not know that by this commonplace action\nshe was reuniting two links in a long-severed chain of destiny, but she\nhad a dim consciousness that she was going to do something much more\nimportant than merely introducing two strangers to each other. She\nlooked quite anxiously at Brenda, who had turned towards them as they\ncame near, and saw that, just for the fraction of a second, her eyes\nbrightened, and a passing flush deepened the delicate colour in her\ncheeks. It was almost like a glance of recognition, and yet she had only\nheard his name two or three times, and certainly had never seen him\nbefore. Then she looked swiftly at Leighton. Yes, there was a flush\nunder his tan and a new light in his eyes. When she had completed the\nintroductions she looked away for a moment, and said in her soul:\n\n\"Thank goodness! If that is not a case of love at first sight, I shan't\nbelieve that there is any such thing, whatever the poets and romancers\nmay say.\"\n\nYes, her womanly intuition was right as far as it reached; but she could\nnot yet grasp the full meaning of the marvel which she had helped to\nbring about. With her father, she believed in the Doctrine of\nRe-Incarnation as the only one which affords a logical and entirely just\nsolution of the bewildering puzzles and ghastly problems of human life\nas seen by the eyes of ignorance. She had grasped in its highest meaning\nthe truth--that Man is really a living soul, living from eternity to\neternity. An immortality with one end to it was to her an unthinkable\nproposition which could not possibly be true. For her, as for her\nfather, Eternal Life and Eternal Justice were one. Where a man ended one\nlife, from that point he began the next: for good or for evil, for\nignorance or for knowledge. A life lived and ended in righteousness\n(not, of course, in the narrow theological sense of the term) began\nagain in righteousness, and in evil meant inexorably a re-beginning in\nevil. That was Fate, because it was also immutable Justice. Man\npossessed the Divine gift of free will to use or abuse as he would, so\nfar as his own life-conduct was concerned; but there was no evasion of\nthe adamantine law of the survival and progress of the fittest, which,\nin the course of ages, infallibly proved to be the best. This, in a\nword, was why \"some are born to honour and some to dishonour.\"\n\nYet she had still to fathom an even subtler mystery than this: the\nmystery of sexual love. Why should one man and one woman, out of all the\nteeming millions of humanity, be irresistibly attracted to each other by\na force which none can analyse or define? Why should a woman, confronted\nwith the choice between two men, one of whom possesses every apparent\nadvantage over the other, yet feel her heart go out to that other, and\nimpel her to follow him, even to the leaving of father and mother and\nhome, and all else that has been dear to her? Why in the soul of every\ntrue man and woman is Love, when it comes, made Lord of all, and all in\nall? It is because Love is co-eternal with Life, and these two have\nloved, perchance wedded, many times before in other lives which they\nhave lived together, and, with the succession of these lives, their love\nhas grown stronger and purer, until \"falling in love\" is merely a\nrecognition of lovers; unconscious, no doubt, to those who have not\nprogressed far enough in wisdom, but none the less necessary and\ninevitable for that.[1]\n\nIs it not from ignorance of this truth, or wilful denial of this law,\nthat all the miseries of mismarriage come forth? Again the woman has\nthe choice. She obeys the bidding of her own lust of wealth and comfort\nand social power, or she submits to the pressure of family influence, or\nthe stress of poverty, and crushes--or thinks she does--the ages-old\nlove out of her heart and marries the man she does not love, never has\nloved, and never can. She has defied the eternal Law of Selection. She\nhas desecrated the sanctity of an immortal soul, and she has defiled the\ntemple of her body. She has sold herself for a price in the\nmarket-place, and has become a prostitute endowed by law with a\nconventional respectability, and for this crime she pays the penalty of\nunsated heart-hunger. Instead of the fruits of Eden distilling their\nsweet juices into her blood, the apples of Gomorrah turn perpetually to\nashes in her mouth. Often weariness and despair drive her to the brief\nintoxication of the anodyne of adultery, a further crime which is only\nthe natural consequence of the first.\n\nBut it must not be thought that women are the only sexual criminals.\nThere are male as well as female prostitutes made respectable by\nconvention, and the debt-burdened man of title who marries to get gold\nto re-gild his tarnished coronet is the worst of these; for too often he\ndrags an innocent but ignorant maiden down to his own vile level. Yet\nthe chief criminal of all is not the individual, but the Society which\nnot only encourages, but too often compels the crime. For this it also\npays the penalty. The collective crime brings the collective curse,\nfor, if human history proves anything, it proves that the Society which\npersistently denies the Law of Selection, and continually defiles the\nAltar of Love, in the end goes down through a foul welter of lust and\ngreed and gluttony into the nethermost Pit of Destruction.\n\nNitocris had not learned this yet. It was not within the plan of Eternal\nJustice that her virgin soul, purified by the strenuous labour of many\nlives towards the Light, should yet be darkened by the shadow of such\ngrim knowledge as this. It was enough for her now that she should be the\nministering angel of Love and Light.\n\nBut at the same moment, standing on that smooth, shady lawn, there were\nalso two incarnations of the destroying angels of Hate and Darkness, for\neven here, amidst this pleasant scene of seemingly innocent pleasure and\nlaughter, the Eternal Conflict was being continued, as it is and must\nbe, wherever man comes in contact with his kith and kind.\n\nSoon after Nitocris and Brenda had joined the group, Phadrig approached\nthe Prince, who happened for the moment to be standing alone at the\nbottom of the lawn, and said softly in Russian:\n\n\"Highness, my dream, as you are pleased to call it, has proved true.\nThat is the Queen--she who was once the daughter of the great Rameses,\nLady of the Upper and Lower Kingdoms.\"\n\n\"What?\" laughed the Prince. \"Miss Marmion, that lovely English girl,\nyour old Egyptian Mummy re-vivified! Well, have it as you like. You are\nwelcome to your dreams as long as you use your arts to help me to lay\nhands on the beautiful reality. I have seen many a fair woman, and\nthought myself in love with some of them, but by the beard of Ivan, I\nhave never seen one like this. I tell you, Phadrig, that the moment my\neyes looked for the first time into hers, only a few minutes ago, I knew\nthat I had found my fate, and, having found it, I shall take very good\ncare that I don't lose it. And you shall help me to keep it; I shall try\nevery fair means first to make her my princess, for, whether she was\nonce Queen of Egypt or not, she is worthy now to sit beside a sovereign\non his throne--and it might be that I could some day give her such a\nplace--but have her I will, if not as fairly-won wife and consort, then\nas stolen slave and plaything, to keep as long as my fancy lasts. And\nlisten, Phadrig,\" he went on in a low tone, but with savage intensity.\n\"Your life is mine, for I gave it back to you when the lifting of a\nfinger would have sent you into what you would call another incarnation;\nand from this day forth you must devote it to this end until it is\nattained, one way or the other. I know you don't care for money as\nwealth, but in this world it is the right hand of power, and that you\nlove. All that you need shall be yours for the asking in exchange for\nyour faithful service. Are you content with the bargain?\"\n\n\"No, Highness, that will not content me,\" replied Phadrig, in a voice\nthat had no expression save unalterable resolve.\n\n\"What! Is not that enough for you, a penniless seller of curios?\" said\nthe Prince, with a sneer in his tone. \"Then I will add to it the ready\naid and unquestioning obedience of our secret police, here and in\nEurope. Will that satisfy you?\"\n\n\"I do not need the help of your police, Highness,\" answered the\nEgyptian, in the same passionless accents. \"They are skilful and brave,\nbut they have not the Greater Knowledge. I could turn the wisest of them\ninto a fool, and frighten the bravest out of his senses in a few\nminutes. Use them yourself, Highness, should it become necessary. They\nwould be less than useless to me.\"\n\n\"Then what will satisfy you?\" asked the Prince impatiently, but with no\nshow of anger, for he knew the strange power of the man whose help he\nneeded.\n\n\"I do not ask you to believe in the reality of what you call my dreams,\nHighness,\" replied Phadrig slowly, \"but I do ask--nay, I require, as the\nprice of my faithful service, your solemn promise in writing, signed and\nattested, that, if and when my dreams become realities, and your own\nhopes are fulfilled, the independence and sovereignty of the Ancient\nLand shall be restored; her temples and tombs and palaces shall be\nrebuilt; her ancient worship revived in my person, and the sceptre of\nRameses replaced in the hand of Nitocris the Queen.\"\n\nThe Prince was silent for a few moments. To grant the seemingly\nextravagant demand meant to reduce the splendid dream and scheme of his\nlife to cold, tangible writing, and to put into this man's hand the\npower to betray him. On the other hand, their aims were one, and only\nthrough him could Phadrig hope to realise his dreams. Of course they\nwere only dreams; but he was faithful to them, and so he would be\nfaithful to him. At the worst it would be easy to arrange a burglary,\nor, for the matter of that, a murder in Candler's Court, and that would\nmake an end of the matter.\n\n\"Very well, Phadrig,\" he said at length. \"It is settled. I will trust\nyou, for it is necessary that we should trust each other. You shall have\nwhat you ask for within a week. Now I must go. I shall tell them that I\nhave been arranging the exhibition of your powers which you are going to\ngive them. It will be well to startle them sufficiently to shake their\nBritish beef-sense up into something like fear. Make them wonder, but,\nfor the sake of our hostess, don't frighten them too much.\"\n\nPhadrig only acknowledged his promise with a bow, and he turned away and\njoined the growing group in which Nitocris and Brenda were still the\ncentral objects of attraction.\n\n+------------------------------------------------------------+\n|FOOTNOTE:                                                   |\n|                                                            |\n|[1] The Doctrine, of course, affords the same explanation of|\n|friendships between man and man, and woman and woman.       |\n|                                                            |\n+------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nTHE MARVELS OF PHADRIG\n\n\nThe time, about an hour or so before tea, was occupied by the guests\naccording to their varying tastes--in tennis, croquet, more or less\ngood-natured gossip, and flirtations which may or may not have been\nserious.\n\nNitocris saw with growing cause for self-gratulation that Lord Leighton\nand Brenda were decidedly attracted towards each other. He, in spite of\nhaving received his gracious, but, as he well knew, final _cong\u00e9_ from\nNitocris, still felt that he was not quite playing the game with\nhimself; but for all that it was impossible for him not to see that the\nemotion, which was even now stirring in his heart, awakened by the first\ntouch of Brenda's hand, and the first meeting of their eyes, was\nsomething very different from the tenderly respectful admiration, the\nreal friendship, inevitably exalted by the magic of sex, which, as he\nsaw now, he had innocently mistaken for love.\n\nHe managed quite adroitly to separate Brenda from the circle, and to\nlure her into a stroll about the outside grounds, during which he told\nher the history and traditions of \"The Wilderness\" not, of course,\nomitting the sad little tragedy of the Lady Alicia, all of which Miss\nBrenda listened to with an interest which was not, perhaps, wholly\nderived from the story itself. She had never yet met any one who was\nquite like this learned, much-travelled, quiet-spoken young aristocrat.\nOn her father's side she was descended from one of the oldest\nKnickerbocker families in the State of New York and her aristocracy\nresponded instinctively to his, and formed a first bond between them.\n\nIt need hardly be said that her beauty and her prospective wealth, to\nsay nothing of the bright, mental, and intellectual atmosphere in which\nshe seemed to live and move, had attracted to her many men whom she had\ninspired with a very genuine desire to link their lives with hers. She\nwas only twenty-two, but she had already refused more than one coronet\nof respectable dignity, and so far her heart had remained as virgin as\nit was when she had admired herself in her first long skirt. But now,\nfor the first time in her life, she began to feel a strange disquietude\nin the presence of a man, and a man, too, whom she had not known for an\nhour. Nitocris had, happily, told her nothing of what had passed between\nLord Leighton and herself, and so the pleasant element in her\ndisquietude was entirely unalloyed.\n\nHer father was already too deeply engrossed in learned converse with his\nbrother professors to take any notice of the great fact which was\nbeginning to get itself accomplished; but her mother's instinct\ninstantly noticed the subtle change that had come over her daughter,\nand she saw it with anything but displeasure. All sensible mothers of\nbeautiful daughters are discreetly sanguine. She was far too wise in her\ngeneration not to have agreed with Brenda's decision in certain former\ncases. The idea of her daughter's beauty and her father's millions being\nbartered for mere rank and social power, however splendid, was utterly\nrepugnant to her. She had married for love, and she wanted Brenda to do\nthe same, whoever the chosen man might be, provided always that he was a\nman--and in this regard there could be no doubt about Lord Lester\nLeighton; so as they walked away she said to Nitocris with a confidence\nwhich was almost girlish:\n\n\"His Lordship is just delightful--now, isn't he, Miss Marmion? Just the\nsort that you seem to raise over here, and nowhere else. Tells you that\nyou have to take him for a gentleman and nothing else in the first three\nwords he says to you--and Brenda seems to like him. I never saw her go\noff with a man like that on such short notice, for Brenda's pretty proud\nand cold with men, for all her nice ways and high spirits.\"\n\n\"You would have to search a long time, Mrs van Huysman,\" replied\nNitocris very demurely, \"before you found a better type of the real\nEnglish gentleman than Lord Leighton. His family is one of the oldest in\nthe country, and, unlike too many of our noble families, the Kynestons\nhave no bar-sinister on their escutcheon.\"\n\n\"I guess you're getting a little beyond me there, Miss Marmion. I don't\nthink I ever heard of a--what is it?--a bar-sinister, before. What might\nit be?\"\n\nNitocris flushed very faintly as she replied:\n\n\"I think I can explain it best, Mrs van Huysman, by saying that it means\nthat Lord Leighton's ancestors have preserved their honour unstained\nthrough many generations. Of course, you know that some of our so-called\nnoble families in England spring from anything but a noble origin. There\nare not a few English dukes and earls who would find it rather awkward\nto introduce their great-great-grandmothers to their present circle of\nfriends.\"\n\n\"I should think they would, from what I have read of them, the shameless\ncreatures!\" said Mrs van Huysman, with a sniff of real republican\nvirtue.\n\nThen the Prince joined them, and the conversation was promptly switched\noff on to another line of interest.\n\nTea was served on the Old Lawn under the shade of the great cedars,\nwhich made its greatest adornment; and when everybody had had what he or\nshe wanted, and the men had lit their cigarettes--and the Professors, by\nspecial permission, their pipes--Nitocris looked across a couple of\ntables at Oscarovitch, whom she had so far managed most adroitly to keep\nat an endurable distance, and said:\n\n\"Now, Prince, if your friend the Adept is in the mood to astonish us\nwith his wonders, perhaps you will be good enough to tell him that we\nare all ready and willing to be startled--only I hope that he will be\nmerciful to our ignorance and not frighten us too much.\"\n\n\"I can assure you, Miss Marmion, that my good friend from Egypt will be\ndiscretion itself,\" replied the Prince, with a look and a courtly\ngesture that inspired Commander Merrill with an almost passionate\nlonging to take him down one of the quiet paths under the beeches for a\nten minutes' interlude. \"I can promise that he will show you some\nmarvels which even your learned and distinguished father and his\n_confr\u00e8res_ may find difficult of explanation: but it shall all be white\nmagic. I understand that your real adept considers the black variety as\nwhat you call bad form.\"\n\nAs the company rose and went in little groups towards the tennis-lawn,\nwhere Phadrig had elected to display his powers, the three Professors\ninstinctively joined each other in a small phalanx of scepticism. If\nthere was any trick or deception to be discovered all looked to them to\ndo it, and they were almost gleefully aware of their responsibility.\nFiguratively speaking, they each wore the scalps of many spiritualistic\nmediums, and both Professor van Huysman and Professor Hartley sensed a\npossible addition to their belts of scientific wampum which would not be\nthe least of their trophies. It had been agreed to by Phadrig, with a\nquiet scorn, that they were to take any measures they liked to detect\nhim in any practice that would convict him of being merely a conjurer;\nand they had accepted the permission with that whole-souled devotion to\ntruth which excludes all idea of pity from the really scientific mind.\nFranklin Marmion was naturally in a very different frame of mind,\nalthough, from reasons of high policy, he assumed a similar mask of\nalmost scornful scepticism; but for all that he was by far the most\nanxious man in the company.\n\nAt the request of their hostess the guests arranged themselves sitting\nand standing in a spacious circle on the tennis-lawn; and when this was,\nformed, Phadrig, whose isolation so far from the rest of the company had\nbeen satisfactorily explained by the Prince, walked slowly into the\nmiddle of it, and, after a quick, keen glance round him--a glance which\nrested for just a moment or so on Professor Marmion and his _confr\u00e8res_,\nand then on Nitocris, who was sitting beside Brenda attended by Lord\nLeighton and Merrill--he said in a low but clear and far-reaching voice,\nand in perfect English:\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, I have come to the house of the learned Professor\nMarmion at the request of my very good friend and patron, His Highness\nPrince Oscar Oscarovitch, to give you a little display of what I may\ncall white magic. But before I begin I must ask you to accept my word of\nhonour as a humble student of the mysteries of what, for want of a\nbetter word, we call Nature, that I am not in any sense a conjurer, by\nwhich I mean one who performs apparent marvels by merely deceiving your\nsenses.\n\n\"What I am going to show you, you really will see. My marvels, if you\nplease to think them such, will be realities, not illusions; and I shall\nbe pleased if you will take every means to satisfy yourselves that they\nare so. I say this with all the more pleasure because I know that there\nare present three gentlemen of great eminence in the world of science,\nand if they are not able to detect me in anything approaching trickery,\nI think you will take their word for it that I am not deceiving you.\n\n\"In order that there may not be the smallest possible chance of error, I\nwill ask Professors Marmion, Hartley, and Van Huysman to come and stand\nnear to me, so that they may be satisfied that I make use of none of the\nmere conjurer's apparatus. I shall use nothing but the knowledge, and\ntherefore the power, to which it has been my privilege to attain.\"\n\nPhadrig spoke with all the calm confidence of perfect self-reliance, and\ntherefore his words were not wanting in effect on his audience, critical\nand sceptical as it was.\n\n\"I reckon that's a challenge we can't very well afford to let go,\" said\nProfessor van Huysman, with a keen look at his two brother scientists.\n\"Of course he's just a trick-merchant, but they're so mighty clever\nnowadays, especially these fellows from the gorgeous East, that you've\ngot to keep your eyes wide open all the time they've got the platform.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Professor Hartley, as they moved out from the circle;\n\"it must be trickery of some sort, and we shall be doing a public\nservice by exposing it. What do you think, Marmion? I hope you won't\nmind the exposure taking place in your own garden and among your own\nguests?\"\n\n\"Not a bit, my dear Hartley,\" replied Franklin Marmion with a smile,\nwhich was quite lost upon his absolutely materialistic friends. \"We\nhave, as Van Huysman says, received a direct challenge. We should be\nmost unworthy servants of our great Mistress if we did not take it up.\nPersonally, I mean to find out everything that I can.\"\n\n\"And, gentlemen,\" laughed the Prince, who had been standing with them\nand now moved away towards Nitocris, \"I sincerely hope that what you\nfind out will be worth the learning.\"\n\n\"He's a big man, that,\" said Professor van Huysman, when he was out of\nearshot, \"but he's not the sort I'd have much use for. I wonder why\nthose people who are on the war-path in his country ever let him out of\nit alive?\"\n\nIn accordance with Phadrig's request, they made a triangle of which he\nwas the central point. Without any formula of introduction, he said\nrather abruptly:\n\n\"Professor van Huysman, will you oblige me by taking a croquet ball and\nholding it in your hand as tightly as you can?\"\n\nBrenda ran out of the circle and gave him one. He took it and gripped it\nin a fist that looked made to hold things. Phadrig glanced at the ball,\nand said quietly:\n\n\"Follow me!\"\n\nThen he turned away, and, in spite of all the Professor's efforts to\nhold it, the ball somehow slipped through his fingers and fell on to the\nlawn. Then, to the utter amazement of every one, except Franklin\nMarmion, it rolled towards the Adept and followed him at a distance of\nabout three yards as he walked round the circle of spectators. He did\nnot even look at it. When he had made the round, he took his place in\nthe Triangle of Science, and the ball stopped at his feet.\n\n\"It is now released, Professor,\" he said to Van Huysman. \"You may take\nit away, if you wish.\"\n\nThere was something in the saying of the last sentence that nettled him.\nHe had seen all, or nearly all, the physical laws, which were to him as\nthe Credo is to a Catholic or the Profession of Faith to a Moslem,\nopenly and shamelessly outraged, defied, and set at nought. To say he\nwas angry would be to give a very inadequate idea of his feelings,\nbecause he, the greatest exposer of Spiritualism, Dowieism, and\nChristian Scientism in the United States, was not only angry, but--for\nthe time being only, as he hoped--utterly bewildered. It was too much,\nas he would have put it, to take lying down, and so, greatly daring, he\ntook a couple of strides towards Phadrig, and said with a snarl in his\nvoice:\n\n\"I guess you mean really if _you_ wish, Mr Miracle-Worker. It was mighty\nclever, however you did it, but you haven't got me to believe that\nphysical laws are frauds yet. You want me to pick that ball up?\"\n\n\"Certainly, Professor--if you can--now,\" replied Phadrig, with a little\ntwitch of his lips which might have been a smile, or something else.\n\nHoskins van Huysman was a strong man, and he knew it. Not very many\nyears before, he had been able to shoulder a sack of flour and take it\naway at a run, and now he could bend a poker across his shoulders\nwithout much trouble. He stooped down and gripped the ball, expecting,\nof course, to lift it quite easily. It didn't move. He put more force\ninto his arms and tried again. For \"all the move he got on it,\" as he\nsaid afterwards, it might have weighed a ton. It was ridiculous, but it\nwas a fact. In spite of all his pulling and straining, the ball remained\nwhere it was as though it had been rooted in the foundations of the\nworld. He was wise enough to know when he was beaten, so he let go, and\nwhen he pulled himself up, somewhat flushed after his exertions, he\nsaid:\n\n\n\"Well, Mister Phadrig, I don't know how you do it, but I've got to\nconfess that it lets me out. I'm beaten. If you can make the law of\ngravitation do what you want, you're a lot bigger man in physics than I\nam.\"\n\nHe turned and went back to his place, looking, as his daughter whispered\nto Nitocris, \"pretty well shaken up.\" The Prince caught Phadrig's eye\nfor an instant, and said:\n\n\"Miss Marmion, will you confound the wisdom of the wise and bring the\nball here?\"\n\nIt was not the words but the challenge in them that impelled her to\nrise from her chair, aided by Merrill's hand, and not the one that the\nPrince held out, and walk across the lawn towards Phadrig. She took no\nnotice of him. She just stooped and picked up the ball and carried it\nback to her chair. She tossed it down on the grass, and sat down again\nwithout a word, quaking with many inward emotions, but outwardly as calm\nas ever. What Professor van Huysman said to himself when he saw this\nwill be better left to himself.\n\nIt might have been expected that the miracle, or at least the\nextraordinary defiance of physical law which had been accomplished by\nPhadrig, would have produced something like consternation among the bulk\nof the spectators. It did nothing of the sort. They were, perhaps, above\nthe ordinary level of Society intellect in London; but they only saw\nsomething wonderful in what had been done. Nothing would have persuaded\nthem that it was not the result of such skill as produced the marvels of\nthe Egyptian Hall, simply because they were not capable of grasping its\ninner significance. Could they have done that, the panic which Professor\nMarmion was beginning to fear would probably have broken the party up in\nsomewhat unpleasant fashion. As it was they contented themselves with\nsaying: \"How exceedingly clever!\" \"He must be quite a remarkable man!\"\n\"I wonder we've never heard of him before!\" \"He must make a great deal\nof money!\" \"I wonder if I could persuade the dear Prince--what a\ncharming man he is!--to bring him to my next At Home day?\" and so on,\nperfectly ignorant, as it was well they should be, that they had\nwitnessed a real conquest of Knowledge over Force.\n\nPhadrig, who seemed to be the least interested person on the lawn,\nlooked about him, and said as quietly as before:\n\n\"I should be very much obliged if the best tennis player in the company\nwill do me the honour to have a game with me.\"\n\nNow, it so happened that Brenda, in addition to her other athletic\nhonours, had recently won the Ladies' Tennis Tournament at Washington,\nwhich carried with it the Championship of the State for the year, and so\nthis challenge appealed both to her pride in the game and her spirit of\nadventure. She looked round at Nitocris, and said:\n\n\"I've half a mind to try, Niti. I suppose he won't strike me with\nlightning or send me down through the earth if I happen to beat him.\nShall I?\"\n\n\"Yes, do,\" replied her hostess, with a suspicion of mischief in her\nvoice; \"those dear Professors of ours are puzzling so delightfully over\nthe first miracle, or whatever it was, that I _do_ want to see them\nworried a little more. It will be a wholesome chastening for the\noverweening pride of knowledge.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" laughed Brenda, rising and dropping a light cloak from her\nshoulders. \"It's the first time I've had the honour of playing against a\nmagician, mind, so you mustn't be too hard on me if I lose.\"\n\nLord Leighton fetched her racquet and one for Phadrig, and they went\ntogether towards the tennis-court in which he was standing. The three\nProfessors left their places and stood at one end of the net, Messrs\nHartley and Van Huysman indulging in audible growls of baffled\nscepticism, and Franklin Marmion silently observant, divided between\ninterest and amusement. He could not help imagining what would happen if\nhe were to stand in the middle of the circle and remove himself to the\nHigher Plane, and then go round shaking hands and saying, \"Good\nafternoon.\"\n\nBrenda acknowledged Phadrig's bow with a gracious nod as she took her\nplace. Then Lord Leighton handed the other racquet to the Adept. To his\nastonishment he declined it with another bow, saying:\n\n\"I thank you, my lord, but I do not need it.\"\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed the other, with a frank stare of astonishment. \"Excuse\nme, but tennis without a racquet, you know--are you going to play with\nyour hands?\"\n\n\"To some extent, yes, my lord,\" replied Phadrig, as he took his place.\n\"Will you ask Miss van Huysman if she will be kind enough to serve?\"\n\nBrenda would. Phadrig stood on the middle line between the two courts\nwith his hands folded in front of him. She certainly felt a little\nnervous, but she knew her skill, and she sent a scorcher of an undercut\nskimming across the net. The ball stopped dead. Phadrig gave a flick\nwith his right forefinger, and it hopped back over the net and ran\nswiftly along the ground to Brenda's feet. She flushed as she picked it\nup and changed courts. Then she raised her racquet and sent a really\nvicious slasher into the opposite court. Phadrig, without moving, raised\nhis hand at the same moment. The ball, hard as it had been driven,\nstopped in mid-air over the net, hung there for a moment, then dropped\non Brenda's side and rolled to her feet again. She picked it up, walked\nto the net with it in her hand, and said quite good-humouredly:\n\n\"I think you're a bit too smart for me, Mr Phadrig. I can't pretend to\nplay against a gentleman who can suspend the law of gravitation just to\nwin a game of tennis.\"\n\n\"I did not do it to win the game, Miss van Huysman,\" he replied with a\ngentle smile; \"I only desired to amuse you and the other guests of\nProfessor Marmion. Now, it may be that some excellent but ignorant\npeople here may think that that ball is bewitched, as they would call\nit, so if you will give it to me, I will send it out of reach.\"\n\nShe handed him the ball, wondering what was going to happen next. He\ntook it and put it on the thumb of his right hand as one does with a\ncoin when tossing. He flicked it into the air, and, to the amazement of\nevery one, saving always Franklin Marmion, it rose slowly up to the\ncloudless sky, followed by the gaze of a hundred eyes, and vanished.\nThen he bowed again to Brenda, and said in the most commonplace tone:\n\n\"It is out of harm's way now. Thank you once more for your\ncondescension.\"\n\n\"But how did it go up like that?\" asked Brenda, looking him frankly and\nsomewhat defiantly in the eyes.\n\n\"That, Miss Huysman,\" he replied with perfect gravity, \"was only a\ndemonstration of what Spiritualists and Theosophists are accustomed to\ncall levitation. It is only a matter of reversing the force of gravity.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\" laughed Brenda, as she turned away. \"You talk of it as\nthough it were a matter of turning a paper bag inside out.\"\n\n\"The one is as easy as the other,\" he smiled. \"It is only a question of\nknowing how to do it.\"\n\nShe walked back to her chair very much mystified, and, for the first\ntime in her so far triumphal journey through the interlude between the\neternities which we call life, a trifle humiliated: but that fact, of\ncourse, she kept to herself. As she dropped back in her chair, she said\nto Lord Leighton:\n\n\"That was pretty wonderful, wasn't it? I'm quite certain that there's no\ntrickery about it. What he did, he really did do.\"\n\n\"I don't pretend to be able to explain it,\" he replied, \"but for all\nthat I've seen very much the same sort of thing done by the fakirs in\nIndia, and I think it's generally admitted that that is either a matter\nof trickery or hypnotism. They make you believe you see what you really\ndon't see at all.\"\n\n\"That's about it,\" said Merrill, with a short laugh, \"Of course no one\nwho knows anything about the East will deny that hypnotism is a fact,\nalthough I must say that these same fakirs have tried it with me more\nthan once and found me a quite hopeless subject.\"\n\nEven as though he had heard him, Phadrig came towards them at the\nmoment, and said in his polite, impersonal tone:\n\n\"Commander Merrill, I am going to try one or two experiments now which I\nshould like to have very closely watched. I know that there is no keener\nobserver in the world than the skilled British naval officer. May I ask\nfor your assistance?\"\n\nThere was something in his tone which made it quite impossible to\nrefuse, so he replied:\n\n\"You have shown us a good many wonders already, Mr Phadrig, and unless\nyou've hypnotised the whole of us, I haven't a notion how you have done\nit; but if I can find you out I will.\"\n\n\"That is exactly what I wish, sir,\" said Phadrig, as he bowed to the\nladies and went back to the centre of the circle. Merrill followed him,\nand, with the three Professors, formed a square about him.\n\nPhadrig, turning slowly round so that his voice might reach all his\naudience, said:\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, you have all heard of or seen the strange\nperformances of the Indian fakirs: the growing of the mango plant, the\nso-called basket trick, and the throwing into the air of a rope up which\nthe performer climbs from view of the spectators. I am not going to say\nwhether those are tricks or not. Their knowledge may be different from\nmine, therefore I do not question it. I only propose to show you the\nsame kind of performance without the use of any coverings or\nconcealment, and leave you and these four gentlemen to discover any\ndeception on my part if you can. I will begin by giving you a new\nversion of the mango trick, if trick it is, with variations. Professor\nMarmion, would you have the goodness to ask one of the young ladies to\nbring me one of those beautiful white roses of yours?\"\n\nFranklin Marmion was on the point of saying: \"I'll bring you one myself,\nand see what you can do with it,\" but he was a sportsman in his way,\nand, seeing that his guests were so far not all inclined to be\nfrightened at what they had seen, he refrained from spoiling the\n\"entertainment,\" as they evidently took it to be, and so he asked his\ndaughter to go and get one of her nicest Mar\u00e8chal Niels.\n\nShe rose from her chair and went to her favourite tree; Merrill followed\nher with a ready penknife. They came back with a fine half-blown rose on\na leafy twig about nine inches long. As she held it out to Phadrig he\ndeclined it with a bow and a wave of his hand, saying:\n\n\"I thank you, Miss Marmion, but it will be better for me not to touch\nit. Some one might think that I had bewitched it in some way; will you\nbe kind enough to give it to Commander Merrill and ask him to put the\nstem into the turf: about two inches down, please.\"\n\nShe handed the rose to Merrill, and as he took it their eyes met for an\ninstant, and she flushed ever so slightly. He, with many unspoken\nthoughts, knelt down, made a little hole in the turf with his knife, and\nplanted the rose. When he stood up again Phadrig went on in the same\nquiet impersonal voice:\n\n\"Now, ladies and gentlemen, you know that this rose is of a pale cream\ncolour slightly tinted with red. It shall now grow into a tree bearing\nboth red and white roses. It will not be necessary for me to touch it.\"\n\nThis somehow appealed more closely to such imagination as the majority\nof the spectators possessed. They had regarded the other marvels they\nhad seen merely as bewilderingly clever examples of legerdemain: but for\na man to make a single sprig of rose grow into a tree bearing both red\nand white roses without even touching it meant something quite\nunbelievable--until they had seen it. Instinctively the circle narrowed,\nand Phadrig noting this, said:\n\n\"Pray, come as close as you like, ladies and gentlemen, as long as you\ndo not pass my guardians, for they have undertaken that you shall not be\ndeceived.\"\n\nThe result was that a smaller circle was formed round the square, at the\nangles of which stood Merrill and the three men of science. Phadrig\nstood at one side facing the east. Then he spread his hands out above\nthe rose, and said slowly:\n\n\"Earth feeds, sun warms, and air refreshes: wherefore grow, rose, that\nthe power of the Greater Knowledge may be manifested, and that those who\nbelieved not before may now see and believe.\"\n\nHe raised his hands with a spreading movement and, to the utter\namazement of every one except Franklin Marmion, who now saw that this\nman certainly had approached to within measurable distance of the\nborderland which he had himself so lately crossed--wherefore in his eyes\nthere was nothing at all marvellous in anything he had done--the leaves\non the sprig grew rapidly out into branches as the main stem increased\nin height and thickness, red and white buds appeared under the leaves\nand swelled out into full blooms with a rapidity that would have been\nquite incredible if a hundred keen eyes had not been watching the marvel\nso closely; and within ten minutes a fine rose-bush, some three feet\nhigh, loaded with red and white and creamy blossoms, stood where Merrill\nhad planted the sprig.\n\nAfter the first gasps of astonishment there arose quite a chorus of\nrequests from the younger members of Phadrig's audience for a rose to\nkeep in memory of the marvel they had seen; but he shook his head, and\nsaid with a smile of deprecation:\n\n\"I regret that it is not possible for me to grant what you ask. For your\nown sakes I cannot do it. If I gave you those roses they would never\nfade, and it might be that those who possessed them would never die. Far\nbe it from me to curse you with such a terrible gift as immortality on\nearth.\"\n\nThe gravely, almost sadly spoken words fell upon his hearer's ears like\nso many snowflakes. Instinctively they shrank back from the beautiful\nbush as though it had been the fabled Upas. They had begun to fear now\nfor the first time. But there was one among them, a young fellow of\ntwenty-two, named Martin Caine, who was already known as one of the most\ndaring and far-sighted of the rising generation of chemical\ninvestigators, to whom the prospect of an endless life devoted to his\ndarling science was anything but a curse. Intoxicated for the moment by\nwhat he had seen, he sprang forward, exclaiming:\n\n\"I'll risk the curse if I can have the life!\"\n\nAs his hand touched one of the roses, Phadrig's darted out and caught\nhis wrist. He was a powerful youth, but the instant Phadrig's hand\ngripped him he stopped, as though he had been suddenly stricken by\nparalysis. He turned a white, scared face with fear-dilated eyes upward,\nand said in a half-choked voice:\n\n\"What's the matter? If what you say's true, give me eternal life, and\nI'll give it to Science.\"\n\n\"My young friend,\" said Phadrig, with a slow shake of his head, \"you are\ngrievously mistaken. You have eternal life already. You may kill your\nbody, or it may die of age or disease, but the life of your soul is not\nyours to take or keep. Only the High Gods can dispose of that. Who am I\nthat I should abet you in defying their decrees? Here is my refusal of\nyour mad request.\"\n\nHe plucked the rose which Caine had touched, held it to his lips and\nbreathed on it. The next instant the withered leaves fell to the\nground, and lay there dry and shrivelled. The stalk was brown and dry.\nAs he released Caine's wrist he dropped the stalk in the middle of the\nbush, and said in a loud tone:\n\n\"As thou hast lived, die--as all things must which shall live again.\"\n\nAs quickly as the rose-bush had grown and flowered so quickly, it\nwithered and died. In a few moments there was nothing left of it but a\nfew dry sticks lying in a little heap of dust.\n\nThe circle suddenly widened out as the people shrank back, every face\nshowing, not only wonder now, but actual fear; and now Franklin Marmion\nfelt that Phadrig had been allowed to go as far as a due consideration\nfor the sanity of his guests would permit. The other two Professors were\ndisputing in low, anxious tones, as if even their scepticism was shaken\nat last: Martin Caine had drifted away through the opening press to hide\nhis terror and chagrin. The Adept stood impassively triumphant beside\nthe poor relics of the rose-bush, but obviously enjoying the\nconsternation that he had produced--for now the lust of power which ever\nattends upon imperfect knowledge had taken hold of him, and he was\ndevising yet another marvel for their bewilderment. But before he had\narrived at his decision, something else happened which was quite outside\nhis programme.\n\nThe Prince broke the chilly silence by saying to Nitocris in a tone loud\nenough for every one to hear:\n\n\"I hope, Miss Marmion, that I have justified my intrusion by the skill\nwhich my friend Phadrig has displayed for the entertainment of your\nguests?\"\n\nShe turned and looked at him, and, as their glances met, he saw a change\ncome over her. Her eyes grew darker: her features acquired an almost\nstony rigidity utterly strange to her. His eyelids lifted quickly, and\nhe shrank back from her as a man might do who had seen the wraith of one\nlong dead, but once well known.\n\n\"Nitocris!\" he murmured in Russian. \"Phadrig was right: it is the\nQueen!\"\n\nShe swept past him--Oscar Oscarovitch, the man who aspired to the throne\nof the Eastern Empire of Europe--as though he had been one of his own\nslaves in the old days, and faced Phadrig.\n\n\"It is enough, Anemen-Ha that was. Hast thou not learned wisdom yet,\nafter so many lives? Is the inmost chamber of thy soul still closed in\nrebellion against the precepts of the High Gods? No more of thy poor\nlittle mummeries for the deception of the ignorant! Go, and without\nfurther display of the weakness which thou hast presumptuously mistaken\nfor strength. The Queen commands--go!\"\n\nOnly Phadrig and Franklin Marmion saw that it was not Nitocris, the\ndaughter of the English man of science, but the daughter of the great\nRameses who stood there crowned and robed as Queen of the Two Kingdoms.\n\nPhadrig raised the palms of his hands to his forehead, bowed before her,\nand murmured:\n\n\"The Queen has but to speak to be obeyed! It is even as I feared. But the\nPrince----\"\n\n\"I who was and am, know what thou wouldst say. Go, or----\"\n\n\"Royal Egypt, I go! But as thou art mighty, have mercy, and make the\nmanner of my going easy.\"\n\nNitocris turned away with a gesture of utter contempt, walked slowly\ntowards her father, and said in English:\n\n\"Dad, I think our friend the Adept is a little tired after his\nwonder-working. I dare say most of us would be if we could do what he\nhas been doing. He seems quite exhausted. I think you had better ask the\nPrince to let his coachman take him home.\"\n\nOscar Oscarovitch's soul was in a tumult of bewilderment, but his almost\nperfect training made it possible for him to say as quietly as though he\nhad been taking leave of his hostess at a reception in London:\n\n\"Miss Marmion, we must thank you for your great consideration. As you\nsay, our friend is undoubtedly fatigued, and, as I have an appointment\nat the Embassy this evening, I will ask you to allow me to take my leave\nas well.\"\n\nWith a comprehensive bow of farewell to the company, and a somewhat limp\nhandshake with Professor Marmion and his daughter, he put his arm\nthrough that of his defeated and humiliated accomplice, and led him away\nthrough an opening which the still dazed spectators instinctively made\nfor them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nCONTROVERSY AND CONFIDENCES\n\n\nAfter this incident, the guests melted away, singly and by pairs and\nfamilies, thanking Nitocris and her father with much _empressement_ for\n\"the delightful afternoon,\" and \"the extraordinary entertainment which\nthey had so much enjoyed,\" and many regrets that \"the poor Adept, who\nreally was so very clever and had mystified them all so delightfully,\"\nhad overdone himself and got ill, and so on, and so on, through the\nendless repetitions and variations usual on such occasions.\n\nA small party, including the Hartleys, the Van Huysmans, Merrill, and\nLord Leighton, had been asked to stay to dinner, but it happened that\nthey had a conversazione already included in the day's programme, and so\nthey took their departure soon after the others, the Professor, it must\nbe confessed, in a somewhat morose frame of mind. Like all men of\nsimilar mental constitution, he hated to be mystified, and now, for the\nfirst time in his long career of investigation into apparently abstruse\nphenomena, he had been absolutely stumped by this perfect-mannered,\nquiet-spoken gentleman from the East who performed wonders in broad\ndaylight, on a plot of grass amidst a crowd of people, and did not\ndeign to even touch the things he worked his miracles with. If he had\nonly used some sort of apparatus, or condescended to some concealment,\nafter the manner of others of this kind, there might have been a chance\nof finding a means of exposure; but the whole performance had been so\ntransparently open and aboveboard that Professor Marcus Hartley, D.Sc.,\nM.A., F.R.S., etc., etc., felt that, as a consistent materialist, he had\nnot been given a fair chance. Still, he did not despair; and by the time\nhe got back into his own den he had resolved that when it did come, as\nof course it must do sooner or later, the exposure of Phadrig the Adept\nand the vindication of Natural Law should be complete and final.\n\nA discussion of the same marvels naturally bulked largely in the\nconversation during dinner at \"The Wilderness.\" Mrs van Huysman did not\ncontribute much wisdom to it beyond the assertion of her conviction that\nsuch things were wicked and should be stopped by law, at which her\ndaughter was sufficiently unfilial to draw a diverting picture of a\nstalwart policeman trying to arrest an elusive adept who could probably\nmake himself invisible at will, or call to his aid fire-breathing\ndragons, just as easily as he could make a tennis ball evaporate into\nthin air, or grow lovely witch-roses and wither them to ashes with a\nbreath.\n\n\"I do think it was a bit mean of him not to let that poor young man have\none of them, if he was willing to take the risk. Especially as he just\nwanted to go on working for Science for ever. Fancy what a single man\nmight do if he could just keep right on with his life-work for, say, a\nthousand years without having to stop it to die and be born again,\naccording to Niti's pet theory. What couldn't a man like that do for\nhuman knowledge!\"\n\n\"Would you have had one of those roses, Brenda, if the Prince's\nmiracle-worker had offered you one?\" asked Nitocris, smiling, but still\nwith a decided note of seriousness in her tone.\n\n\"I?\" laughed Brenda, leaning back in her chair. \"Sakes, no, child! I've\nhad a pretty good time so far, and I hope it won't be over just yet;\nbut, after all, there must be a limit even to the combinations of human\nlife, and a time would have to come when you'd just be doing the same\nold things over and over again. And, besides that, think of the horror\nof living on and on and seeing every one you loved--husband and wife,\nand children and grandchildren--grow old and die, and leave you alone in\na world of strangers. No; life's a good thing if you only have fair play\nin the world; but so is death when you've lived your life. It's only\nlike going to bed, after all. Eternal life would be like a day with no\nnight to it, and that, I guess, would get a bit monotonous after a\ncentury or two. What do you think, Professor?\"\n\n\"My dear Miss van Huysman,\" replied her host with one of his rare but\neloquent smiles, \"since I began to study the question with anything\nlike enlightenment, I have not been able to look upon what we call life,\nby which I mean existence in this or some other world, as anything but\neternal. In its manifestations to our senses it is, I admit, merely\ntransitory, a brief span of time between two other states which, for\nwant of a better word, we may call two eternities; but I must confess\nthat, to me, a human existence beginning with the cradle and ending with\nthe grave is merely a more or less tragic riddle without an answer: in\nother words, a meaningless absurdity. I find it quite impossible to\nconceive any deity or presiding genius of the universe who could be\nguilty of such a colossally useless tragedy as human life would be under\nthose circumstances.\"\n\n\"I can't see it, my dear Marmion,\" said Brenda's father a trifle\ngruffly, for he had not yet quite recovered from the disquieting\nexperiences of the afternoon. \"What does it matter whether we live again\nor not as long as we live cleanly and do our work honestly while we are\nalive? Surely if we leave this world a little bit better, a little bit\nricher in knowledge, than we find it, these poor little lives of ours,\nsuch as they are, and that's not much--will not have been lived in vain.\nOf course, as you know, I'm just a common, low-down materialist who\ncan't rise to the poetry of things as you can with this gorgeous theory\nof re-incarnation of yours.\n\n\"I should very much like to believe it if I could, as I once said to an\neminent revivalist on the war-path in the States; but the trouble with a\nman who is honest with himself is that he can no more make himself\nbelieve what doesn't seem true to him than he can make himself hungry\nwhen he isn't. All the horrible history of religious persecution is just\nthe story of a lot of bigots in power trying to force helpless people to\ndo what they couldn't do honestly. The awful part of the business is\nthat they were most likely all wrong, and didn't know it.\"\n\n\"But, at least, Professor, I hope you are able to give them credit for\nhonest intentions, however mistaken they might have been?\" interposed\nMerrill, who was the son of a country parson and had so far preserved\nhis simple faith intact. It may be remarked here, that Nitocris was well\naware of this, and loved her strong-souled sailor all the better for it.\nFranklin Marmion did not, but then he thought any creed good enough for\n\"a mere fighting man.\"\n\n\"There were schemers and scoundrels among them on both sides, sir,\"\nreplied the American quietly. \"The temptation was too big; but I am\nquite willing to allow that the majority of them, even the Inquisitors,\nwere honest zealots who really did think it right to produce any amount\nof suffering and misery here on earth in order to get matters\nstraightened out, as they thought, hereafter. Charles V. was the most\nenlightened monarch of his age and the worst persecutor, and Torquemada,\naway from his religion, was as kind-hearted a man as ever lived. Calvin\nwas a good man, but he watched Servetus burn, and our own Pilgrim\nFathers on the other side were just about as hard men as any when it\ncame to arguing out a religious question with whips and pillories and\nthumbscrews, and the like. I don't want to offend any one's sentiment or\nquestion any one's faith. To each man the belief that satisfies him, but\npersonally I have no use for a religion that can't get itself believed\nwithout persecution.\"\n\n\"I quite agree with you there, Professor,\" replied Merrill, who felt a\nlittle chilled by the perfect aloofness with which the other spoke, and\nwas wondering what his dear old father, living his quiet, saintly life\namong the Derbyshire dales, would have thought of such cold-blooded\nheresy. \"I have always looked upon that sort of brutal intolerance as a\nform of religious mania--sincere, but still mania, and the story of it\nis the most awful chapter in human history----\"\n\n\"Except, perhaps, the story of war,\" interrupted Professor Marmion, with\na snap in his voice. Monomania, more or less harmless, is a not\ninfrequent affliction of very high intelligences, and a quite\nunreasoning hatred of war was his, although within the last few days he\nhad come to suspect disquieting misgivings on the subject, possibly in\nconsequence of the higher knowledge to which he was attaining.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" replied Merrill quite good-humouredly, and not at all\nsorry for the diversion, \"I am glad to say that I agree with you also.\nNo man who has not actually fought can have any just idea of the\nappalling abominations of war, and I am sure that no men hate it more\ndevotedly than those who have to fight. But we have to take the world as\nit is, and not as we would like it to be; and as long as we have people\nin it who want to set it on fire for their own brutally selfish\npurposes, we shall have to keep the fire-extinguishers in good order.\"\n\nIn obedience to an appealing glance from his daughter, the Professor did\nnot reply. His opponent in the bloodless arena of Science saved him by\ninterrupting:\n\n\"Yes, sir. I differ from my friend Marmion on a good many points, and\nthat's one of them. You have the honour to serve in the biggest\nfire-extinguishing institution on earth. It was the British Navy that\nput out Napoleon's bonfire that he was making of the world: you kept the\nring round us and Spain, and round Russia and Japan, and you've saved\nmore conflagrations than half a dozen Noah's floods would put out.\nThat's why the Kaiser and his tin-hatted firebrands have such a healthy\ndislike for you. They'd have had the world on fire years ago if they\nhadn't had to worry about you.\"\n\n\"I think you must admit, Professor Marmion,\" said Lord Leighton, who had\nso far been busy with his own new thoughts and the contemplation of the\ninspirer of them, \"that it is people like these on whom the real guilt\nof the crime of war rests. Now that the pressure of the bear's paw is\nremoved, Germany is the danger-spot of the world. The Maroocan business\nproved that pretty clearly; and nothing but our friendship with America\nand France and Japan, and the ability to strike hard and instantly at\nsea, saved Europe, and perhaps the world, from something like a\nrepetition of the Napoleonic wars.\"\n\n\"With Mister William Hohenzollern a Napoleon,\" added Professor van\nHuysman, with a half-suppressed snort. \"It seems to me as though that\ngentleman had been spreading himself round Europe as German War-Lord so\nlong that he's getting tired of playing at it, and 's just spoiling for\na real fight.\"\n\n\"That is very possible,\" said Merrill; \"but happily he has\nresponsibilities, and even the German war party would not follow him as\nfar as he would like to go, to say nothing of the Liberals and the\nSocialists. Personally, I must say that I think we have had a much more\ndangerous person, as far as the peace of the world is concerned, on the\nlawn of 'The Wilderness' this afternoon.\"\n\n\"Of course you mean that hateful Russian Prince who brought that equally\nhateful Adept, as he calls himself, with him,\" said Nitocris, with an\nunwonted harshness that made every one look up.\n\n\"Oh, Niti,\" exclaimed Brenda, \"and I asked you to let me bring him!\"\n\n\"I'm very sorry, dear,\" she replied quietly, but with a smile of\nreassurance. \"It was not your fault, of course. He may have been very\nnice to you, but I am obliged to say that the first moment I looked at\nhim I was possessed by some inexplicable feeling of dislike, and even\nfear, although I certainly never hated or feared any one before. If I\nhad met him before I got your note, I really think I should have asked\nyou to spare us the honour. It seemed to me as though there was\nsomething uncanny about the man. It was very curious.\"\n\nHer father looked up at her for a moment, wondering what would happen if\nhe were to explain the mysterious antipathy there and then. The little\ntheological discussion would look very small after such a revelation as\nthat. But he, too, had had a revelation which the somewhat desultory\nconversation had done something to press home upon him. He had seen the\nadvent of the Queen, and heard what she had said to Phadrig with other\neyes and ears than his guests had done, for to them it had only been\nNitocris who had gone to him and said a few inaudible words, which they\nhad taken as a request for the conclusion of his \"performance.\"\n\nHe had seen back through the mists of many centuries and recognised them\nas they had been, and he had learned that Oscarovitch the Russian had\nnow entered the circle of the Queen's, and therefore his own, influence.\nA sudden anxiety for the safety of his darling Niti had awakened in his\nheart. He had seen the lust for possession flame in the man's eyes, and\nnow that he knew who he was--and had been--he determined that whatever\nother adventurer might set the world aflame, the Modern Skobeleff should\nnot do it if he and his Royal ally on the Higher Plane could prevent it.\nHis coming had been a curious coincidence, possibly a consequence of\nobscure causes; but, for some reason or other, he felt himself beginning\nto look with a more favourable eye on Commander Mark Merrill--perhaps\nbecause he was the impersonation of uncompromising hostility to\neverything that Oscarovitch represented.\n\nDinner had come to an end now, and so Nitocris took advantage of ending\na conversation which bade fair to become somewhat awkward. She glanced\nround the table and rose, saying:\n\n\"Don't you think we've had polemics enough for one little dinner, Dad?\nThere's a lovely moon, so we'll have our coffee on the verandah, and you\nand Mr van Huysman can settle the affairs of the universe comfortably\nover your pipes. Give Lord Leighton and Mr Merrill something to smoke,\nand we will join you when we have got some wraps.\"\n\nWhen they got back from Nitocris's rooms Mrs van Huysman elected to take\nher coffee in a big, deep-seated armchair by the drawing-room window.\nShe said that she had felt the sun a little, and might possibly indulge\nin forty winks--which she did within a few minutes of getting\ncomfortably arranged in it. Then Nitocris took Brenda by the arm and\nwalked her half-way down the lawn.\n\n\"I want to take possession of Lord Leighton for about half an hour,\ndear, if you don't mind. I've got something very serious to say to him.\nDad, with the characteristic cowardice of his sex, has left it to me to\nsay. It's--well, it's about a mummy: a female mummy, or, at least, I\nsuppose I ought to say a mummy that was once a female--about five\nthousand years ago.\"\n\n\"My dear Niti----\"\n\n\"No, no, don't interrupt me, for goodness' sake. It's too serious. It is\nreally. We've had something like a tragedy here in the last few days,\nand things seem to have been, as you would say, a good deal mixed up\never since. I don't understand it a bit; but they have been.\"\n\n\"But, my dear Niti, what on earth can you have to say to Lord\nLeighton about a--a female mummy? What possible interest can a\nfive-thousand-year-old corpse have for him?\"\n\n\"Don't, Brenda, don't--at least not just now! Wait till I've told you,\nand then you'll see,\" said Nitocris, pressing her arm closer to her\nside. \"Lord Leighton is, as I think you know, an enthusiastic student of\nEgyptian antiquities. He was also, or thought he was, in love with my\nunworthy self. He found this mummy in a royal tomb at Memphis. He--well,\nI suppose, stole it--of course under the usual licence from the\nKhedive--and sent it home to Dad. Now comes the mystery. That was the\nmummy of Nitocris, the daughter of the great Rameses, and it was the\ndead image of my living self.\"\n\n\"Oh, but, Niti--what do you mean?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Brenda. I wish I did. All I do know is that it was stolen\nthat very night out of Dad's study in the Old Wing, and that I've got to\ntell Lord Leighton all about it. I'm sure Dad could have told him much\nbetter, only somehow he seems afraid.\"\n\n\"Oh, is that all--just the stealing of what was perhaps a very valuable\nrelic? They try to steal much fresher corpses than that in the States if\nthere are dollars in the business.\"\n\n\"Don't be brutal, Brenda! I know you don't mean it, and it isn't like\nyou. Now, listen. Before he went to Egypt this time Lord Leighton asked\nme to marry him. I said 'No,' and for two reasons. I knew that he liked\nme very much--he always has done--and poor Dad took his liking for love\nand encouraged him: but I'm a woman and, I know, that liking isn't\nlove--and then I love some one else. And now he, I mean Lord\nLeighton--loves some one else. Turn your face to the moon. Yes, you know\nwho the some one else is. I'm so glad, for I do think you----\"\n\n\"Niti, you're talking arrant nonsense for an educated young woman. I've\nonly known His Lordship for a day, and how can you----\"\n\n\"Because female Bachelors of Science and graduates of Vassar, whatever\nstupid people may say, have hearts _as_ well as intellects, dear, and so\nthey know. I seem to have had a kind of sixth sense given to me to-day,\nand, when you met Lord Leighton, I saw it, and I believe you _felt_ it.\nI saw your eyes brighten and your face flush--only a little, but it did,\nand so did his. You know my belief in the Doctrine. You may have been\nlovers--perhaps wedded lovers--once upon a time, as they say in the\nfairy tales.\"\n\n\"How awful--no, I mean how wonderful--if it could only be true! And now,\nas you've told me all this, you might as well tell me who your some one\nelse is.\"\n\n\"Really, Brenda, I thought you had more perception. He's there on the\nverandah smoking with your Lord Leighton.\"\n\n\"Oh! Then, of course, you're going to marry him?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry to say Dad doesn't want me to. With all his genius and\nlearning he is a perfect child in that sort of thing. He has no idea of\nNatural Selection. Now listen again, Brenda.. When I had to tell Mark\nthat Dad wouldn't let me marry him, he picked me up out of a chair in\nthe verandah there, where your father and mine are sitting, and kissed\nme three times.\"\n\n\"And I'll gamble ten cents that you kissed him back. That's Natural\nSelection, if I know anything about it. Niti, if that man--and he is a\nman--doesn't get killed in a fight, he'll marry you in spite of all the\nmisguided scientific Dads on earth. Don't you worry. You've made me just\nhappy. I'm not emotional that way, but I'd like to kiss you if the moon\nwasn't so bright. Suppose we go back and try to assist the kindly Fates\na little bit?\"\n\nThe Fates which, in some dimly-perceived fashion, seem to shape our\nlittle successive phases of existence, were certainly in a kindly mood\nthat \"lovely night in June.\" The two Professors had retired to Franklin\nMarmion's sanctum for the discussion of whisky and soda and the\npossibilities of physical manifestations of the Occult. Mrs van Huysman\nwas frankly and comfortably sleeping in the deep, amply-cushioned\narmchair, and the two young men were almost as frankly pining for\nsweeter companionship than their own.\n\nBut the pairing off, which was so deftly managed by Nitocris, did not at\nfirst appear entirely satisfactory to them, yet a very few minutes'\nconversation sufficed to convince them of the wisdom of the arrangement.\nBrenda, with all the delicate tact which makes every highly-trained\nwoman a skilled diplomatist, managed, not only to completely charm\nMerrill as a man who is in love with another woman likes to be charmed,\nbut also to make him understand even more clearly than he had done how\ngreatly the Fates had blessed him by giving him the love of such a girl\nas Nitocris; and then, by a few very deftly conveyed suggestions, she\nfurther gave him to understand that, so far as Lord Leighton had ever\nbeen an unconscious obstacle in his path, he was even now engaged in\nremoving himself. Wherefore Commander Merrill enjoyed his smoke and\nstroll under the beeches a good deal more than he had anticipated.\n\nMore difficultly ambiguous, certainly, was the position in which Lord\nLeighton found himself with Nitocris, but here also her tact and\nperfect candour helped his own innate chivalry to accomplish all that\nwas desirable with the slightest possible friction. She began by telling\nhim, as she had told Brenda, of the mysterious stealing of the Mummy,\nand made a sort of apology for her father having deputed the telling of\nit to her--of course, in perfect innocence of the real reason for his\ndoing so. He deplored with her the loss of what they both believed to be\na priceless relic of the Golden Age of Egypt, but he passed it over\nlightly, chiefly for the reason that there was something in his mind\njust now that was much more serious than even the loss of the mummy of\nher long-dead namesake.\n\nThere had been a little silence between them after he had made his\ncondolences, and then he said, with a hesitation which told quite\nplainly what was coming:\n\n\"Miss Marmion, I have a rather awkward confession to make to you--I have\ngot to tell you, in fact, I think it is my duty to--well, honestly I\nreally don't quite know how to put it properly, but--but--er, something\nhas happened to me to-day that is a good deal more important to me, at\nleast, than the disappearance of half a dozen royal mummies.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" said Nitocris, with a demurely perfect assumption of\nignorance. \"A good many things seem somehow to have happened to-day. It\nis something connected with that wonderful Adept's marvels, perhaps?\nThey have certainly astonished most of us, I think.\"\n\n\"No,\" he replied, still a trifle hesitatingly, \"it is nothing connected\nwith him or his miracles, as far as I know, except that there was\ncertainly something decidedly queer about the man and the impression he\nmade upon one. Of course I have seen something like the same thing in\nEgypt and the Farther East; but he seemed quite what I might call\nuncanny. Still, that's not the point, although possibly it may have had\nsomething to do with it.\"\n\nHe hesitated again. She looked at him with a sideway glance, and said,\nalmost in a whisper: \"Yes?\"\n\nThe moonlight was bright enough for him to see the notes of\ninterrogation in her eyes, and he took the plunge.\n\n\"Miss Marmion, I once told you that I loved you and wanted you for my\nwife, and--and the real fact is that it--I mean I know now that it\nwasn't true--and so I thought I ought to tell you. You know, of course,\nthat the Professor----\"\n\n\"My dear Lord Leighton,\" she answered, with an air of quite superior\nwisdom, \"my learned father is a very clever man in his own subjects: but\nI think I know a great deal more about this particular one than he does.\nYou are quite right. You did not love me. You liked me very much, I have\nno doubt----\"\n\n\"Yes, and so I do still, and always shall do, but----\"\n\n\"But your liking was great enough to make you mistake it for love.\nWomen's instincts are quicker and keener in these relations than men's\nare, and I saw that you did not love me as a real woman has to be loved,\nand, to be quite frank with you, some one else did. I like you very\nmuch, Lord Leighton, and I am going to go on liking you; but, you see, I\ncould not give you what I had already given away. Now, you have told me\nso much that you ought to tell me a little more. How did your sudden\nenlightenment on that interesting subject come about?\"\n\nHe was infinitely relieved by the absolutely frank and friendly way in\nwhich she had treated the whole subject, and so he had courage to reply\nwith a laugh:\n\n\"In short, Miss Marmion, you ask me who the other girl is. Well, you\ncertainly have a right to know, because, curiously enough, I might never\nhave got to know her but for you----\"\n\n\"Is it Brenda?\"\n\nThe question was whispered, and he replied in a whisper:\n\n\"Yes; do you think I have any chance?\"\n\nA cohort of wild cats would not have torn Brenda's secret out of her\nfriend's soul, and so she replied in a tone that was almost judicious in\nits evenness:\n\n\"That, my friend, is a question that you can only get answered by asking\nanother--and you must ask her, not me.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, of course I must,\" he said rather limply. \"But she's so\nsplendid--so beautiful, so exquisite--and--I do wish she wasn't so very\nrich. You see, even if I had the great good fortune to--to get her to\nmarry me, I have lots for both; and, you know, the moment an Englishman\nwith a title gets engaged to an American millionairess everybody says\nthat he is simply dollar-hunting.\"\n\n\"That, unfortunately, is usually too well justified by the facts,\" she\nreplied seriously. \"But only the most idiotic and ignorant of gossips\ncould possibly say that of you. Every one who is any one knows that the\nKyneston coronet does not want re-gilding.\"\n\nAnd then she went on, glancing sideways at him again:\n\n\"Still, as you know perfectly well, in matters of this kind, these very\ndelicate diplomatic considerations, I do not care whether it is a\nquestion of fifty shillings a week or fifty thousand a year. You once\npaid me the very great compliment of offering me rank, position, and\nalmost everything that a girl, from the merely material point of view\ncould ask for. I refused, because I felt certain that you and I did not\nlove each other--however much we may have liked and respected each\nother--as a man and woman ought to do, unless they become guilty of a\ngreat sin against each other. To put it in a very hackneyed way, we were\nnot each other's affinities. I had already found mine--and I think, and\nhope, that you have found yours--and I wish you all the good fortune\nthat you may, and, perhaps, can win.\"\n\n\"If is very, very good of you, Miss Marmion; but do you think you\ncould--well, help me a little? I know I don't deserve it.\"\n\n\"No, sir, you do not,\" she laughed softly, because the other two were\ncoming back on to the lawn. \"I wonder that you have--I have half a mind\nto say the impudence--to ask such a thing. You have confessed your\nfickleness in an almost shameless way; and now you ask me to help you\nwith the other girl! No, my lord: if I know anything of Brenda van\nHuysman's nature, there is no one who can help you except yourself. Of\ncourse she might----\"\n\n\"Do you really think she might--I mean in that way?\"\n\n\"Who am I that I should know the secrets of another woman's soul?\" she\nreplied, with unhesitating prevarication. \"There she is. Go and ask her,\nand take my best wishes with you. Now I am going to talk to _my_\naffinity for a few minutes.\"\n\n\"So it was Merrill, after all!\" he said to himself, as they joined the\nothers. \"Well, I'm glad. He's a splendid fellow; and she--of course,\nshe's worth the love of the best man on earth--and I'm afraid that's\nnot--anyhow, I'll have Miss Brenda's opinion on the subject before I go\nhome to-night.\"\n\nIt now need hardly be added that the said opinion was not only entirely\nsatisfactory, but also very sweetly expressed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nOVER THE TEA AND THE TOAST\n\n\nThe next morning there were, at least, three eventful breakfasts\n\"partaken of,\" as it was once the fashion to say; one at \"The\nWilderness,\" one at the Savoy, and one at the Kyneston town house in\nPrince's Gate.\n\nWhen Professor Marmion came down he was a little late, for he had done a\nlong night's work, finishing his lecture-notes to his own satisfaction,\nor, at least, as nearly as he could get there. Like all good workers, he\nwas never quite satisfied with what he did. When the maid had closed the\ndoor of the breakfast-room, he looked across the table at his daughter\nwith a twinkle in his eyes, and said:\n\n\"Niti, before Lord Leighton left last night he had a talk with me, and\nyou were partly the subject of it.\"\n\n\"And who might have been the other part of the subject, Dad?\" she asked,\nwith excellently simulated composure.\n\n\"That, Niti,\" he replied slowly, \"I expect you know quite as well as I\ndo. I am inclined to consider myself the victim of something very like a\nconspiracy.\"\n\n\"I think you are quite right, Dad,\" she replied, with perfect calmness.\n\"But the chief conspirators were the Fates themselves. We others only\ndid as we had to do. When you have solved that problem of N to the\nfourth, I think you will see that we could really have done nothing\nelse, because, if you once crossed the border-line--the horizon which\nProfessor Cayley spoke of, I mean--you ought to be on speaking terms\nwith them.\"\n\nBefore he replied to this somewhat searching remark, the man who _had_\ncrossed the horizon emptied his coffee cup, and set it down in the\nsaucer with a perceptible rattle. Then he said more slowly than before:\n\n\"My dear Niti, there are other mysteries than N to the fourth. I only\nwish now to confess frankly to you that I have tried to solve one of\nthem, perhaps the greatest of all, and ignominiously failed. I learnt a\ngreat deal last night from a young man to whom I thought I could have\ntaught anything, and I got up this morning in a distinctly chastened\nframe of mind; and so, to make a long story short, if you like to drive\ninto town and bring Commander Merrill back to lunch, I shall be very\npleased to have a chat with him afterwards.\"\n\nThe next moment Nitocris was on the other side of the table, with her\narm round her father's shoulders. She kissed him, and whispered:\n\n\"You dearest of dears! If I could have loved you any more, I would now,\nbut I can't. I won't drive into town, because Brenda's coming out with\nLord Leighton in her new motor to fetch me; at least, she will, if other\npapas have been as delightful as you have been.\"\n\nHe put his hand up and stroked her cheek with a gesture that was older\nthan she was, and said with a smile which meant more than she could\ncomprehend:\n\n\"Ah! so it _was_ a conspiracy, after all! Well, dear, I hope that, for\nall your sakes, it will turn out a successful one.\"\n\nAbout the same time Brenda was saying to her parents:\n\n\"Poppa and Mammy, I've got some news to tell you, and I've slept on it,\nso as to make quite sure about the telling.\"\n\n\"And what might that be, Brenda?\" asked her mother, looking up a trifle\nanxiously. \"Nothing very serious, I hope.\"\n\n\"Anything connected with the Marmions?\" asked her father, in a voice\nthat sounded as though it had come from somewhere far away. He had the\n_Times_ propped up against the sugar basin on his left hand, and he had\njust read the announcement of Franklin Marmion's lecture for the\nfollowing evening, and this was quite a serious matter for him.\n\n\"It's connected with them in this way,\" said Brenda, leaning her elbows\non the table. \"You and Uncle have wanted a coronet in the family, and\nyou know that I've refused three, because the men who wore them weren't\nfit to respect, to say nothing about loving. Well, I've just discovered\nthat I do love a man who has one coronet now, and will have another some\nday, unless something unexpected happens to him; but mind, it's the man\nI love and want to marry, and I'd want to do it just the same if he was\nstill the same man he is, and hadn't either a coronet or a dollar to his\nname.\"\n\n\"That's like you, Brenda, and it sounds good,\" said her father, tearing\nhis attention away from the alluring title of Franklin Marmion's\nlecture. \"Now, who is it?\"\n\n\"If it was only that nice young man, Lord Leighton!\" said Mrs van\nHuysman, in a voice that sounded like an appeal against the final\njudgment of human fate, \"but, of course, he's----\"\n\n\"No, Mammy, that's just what he's _not_ going to do,\" exclaimed Brenda,\nsitting up and clasping her hands behind her neck. \"Nitocris Marmion is\nin love with some one else, and Lord Leighton is in love with me--at\nleast he said so last night at 'The Wilderness,' and I don't suppose\nhe'd have said it if he hadn't meant it--and I told him to go and ask\nhis Papa: and now I'm going to ask my Poppa and Mammy if I may be Lady\nLeighton soon, and, perhaps, some day Countess of Kyneston. You see,\nLord Leighton is just a viscount now----\"\n\n\"What, just a viscount!\" exclaimed Mrs van Huysman, getting up from her\nchair and putting a plump arm round her neck. \"Just a viscount--and heir\nto one of the oldest peerages in England! Oh, Brenda, is it really\ntrue?\"\n\n\"I guess Brenda wouldn't say it if it wasn't, and that's about all there\nis to it,\" said her father, putting his long arm out over the table. \"I\ncongratulate you, my girl. Mammy and I may have been a bit troubled over\nsome of those other refusals of yours, but you seem to have known best,\nafter all: and I reckon your Uncle Ephraim'll think the same. Lord\nLeighton's a man right through. He wouldn't have done what he has done\nif he hadn't been. Shake, child, and----\"\n\nBrenda \"shook,\" and then, without another word, she got up and hurried\nout of the room.\n\n\"The girl's right!\" said Professor van Huysman, as the door closed\nbehind her; \"and if I'm not a fool entirely, she's found the right man.\"\n\n\"Hoskins, you can leave that to a well-brought-up girl like Brenda all\nthe time. She _is_ right, and all we've got to hope for now is that the\nEarl will be right too,\" said his wife somewhat anxiously.\n\n\"He's just got to see our girl and then he will be, unless he's a\nnatural born idiot, which, of course, he couldn't be,\" replied Brenda's\nfather in a tone of absolute conviction. \"Now, I wonder what that man\nMarmion's going to let loose on us to-morrow night?\"\n\n\"Good morning, sir,\" said Lord Leighton, as his father came into the\nbreakfast-room at about the same time that Brenda left the other room in\nthe Savoy.\n\n\"Good morning, Lester,\" replied the Earl of Kyneston, as father and son\nshook hands in the old courtly fashion which, within the last half\ncentury, has gone out of vogue save among those who have ancestors whose\nrecord is a credit to their descendants. \"You are looking very well and\nfit--and there is something else. What is it? Had you a very pleasant\nevening yesterday at 'The Wilderness'? Has Miss Marmion revoked her\ndecision after all?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" said his son, looking at him with brightening eyes; \"but she\nconvinced me that I had thought myself in love with the wrong girl--and\nthe other girl was on the lawn at the same time, talking with the man\nthat Miss Marmion was, and is in love with, and will be always, I\nthink.\"\n\n\"And the other young lady, Lester--because, of course, she is a lady, I\nmean in our sense of the word, much misunderstood as it is in these\ndays?\"\n\n\"She is Brenda van Huysman, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh, the Professor's daughter.--I mean the other Professor's daughter. A\nvery good family. Her father is a distinguished man, and, if I remember\nrightly, a Van Huysman was one of the first colonisers of New England\nabout four hundred years ago. It is the same family, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; I can vouch for that.\"\n\nNitocris had given him the whole history of the family, and so he was\nsure of his facts.\n\n\"Lester, I congratulate you,\" replied his father, taking his arm, as\nthey were accustomed to. \"While you have been away digging among those\nEgyptian tombs and temples, this girl has refused at least three\ncoronets, and one had strawberry leaves on it; so she loves you for\nyourself. That is good, other things being equal, as I think they will\nbe in this case. Now, we will go to breakfast, and you shall tell me the\nwhole story. I have not heard a real love story for a good many years.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\"SUPPOSED IMPOSSIBILITIES\"\n\n\nIt was only to be expected that the announcement of a lecture with such\nan alluring title by such a distinguished scholar and scientist as\nProfessor Franklin Marmion should fill the theatre of the Royal Society,\nas the reporters said tritely but truly, \"to its utmost capacity.\"\n\nThe mere words, \"An Examination of Some Supposed Mathematical\nImpossibilities,\" were just so many bomb-shells tossed into the middle\nof the scientific arena. The circle-squarers, the triangle-trisectors,\nthe cube-doublers, the flat-worlders, and all the other would-be workers\nof miracles plainly impossible in a world of three dimensions\njumped--not incorrectly--to the conclusion that their favourite\nimpossibility would be selected for examination, and, perhaps--blissful\nthought!--demonstration by one of the foremost thinkers of the day, to\nthe lasting confusion of the scoffers. Learned pundits of the old\nschool, who were firmly convinced that Mathematics had long ago said\ntheir last word, and that to talk about \"supposed impossibilities\" was\nblasphemy of the rankest sort, came with note-books and a grim\ndetermination to explode Franklin Marmion's heresies for good and all.\nDreamers of Fourth Dimensional dreams came hoping against hope, for the\nProfessor was known to be something of a dreamer himself; and added to\nall these there assembled a distinguished company of ladies and\ngentlemen who looked upon the lecture as a \"function\" which their social\npositions made it necessary for them to patronise. The reader's personal\nfriends and acquaintances, including Prince Oscarovitch and Phadrig,\nwere naturally among the most anxiously interested of the Professor's\naudience.\n\nIt is almost needless to say that Hoskins van Huysman had donned all his\npanoply of scientific war, and had armed himself with what he believed\nhis keenest weapons; and that Professor Hartley looked with amused\nconfidence to a veritable battle royal of wits when the lecture was over\nand the discussion began. The Prince and Phadrig were keenly\nanticipative, and the latter not a little nervous.\n\nA verbatim report of that famous lecture would, of course, be out of\nplace in these pages. If Professor Marmion's words of wonder are not\nalready written in the archives of the Royal Society, no doubt they will\nbe in the fullness of time when the minds of men shall have become\nprepared to receive them. Here we are mainly concerned with the results\nwhich they produced upon his audience. Certain portions may, however, be\nproperly reproduced here.\n\nWhen the decorous murmur of applause which greeted the President's\nclosing sentences had died away, and Franklin Marmion went to the\nreading-desk and unfolded his notes, there was a tense silence of\nanticipation, and hundreds of pairs of eyes, which had some of the\nkeenest brains in Europe behind them, were converged upon his spare,\nerect figure and his refined, clear-cut, somewhat sternly-moulded face.\n\n\"Mr President, my lords, ladies, and gentlemen,\" he began, in his quiet,\nbut far-reaching tones. \"The somewhat peculiar title which I have chosen\nfor my lecture was not, I hope I need scarcely say, selected with a view\nof arousing any but that intelligent curiosity which is always\ncharacteristic of such a distinguished audience as that which I have the\nhonour of addressing to-night. I chose it after somewhat anxious\nconsideration, because I am aware that the bulk of opinion in the world\nof science strongly insists upon the finality of the axioms of\nmathematics, and therefore it was with no little hesitancy that I\napproached such a subject as this. I am well aware that, in the\nestimation of most of my learned _confr\u00e8res_ and fellow-seekers after\nscientific truth, to suggest those axioms may not embody final and\nuniversal truth is, if I may put it so, to lay sacrilegious hands on the\nArk of the Scientific Covenant.\"\n\nA low murmur, prelude of the coming storm, ran through the theatre, and\nProfessor van Huysman permitted himself to snort distinctively, for\nwhich he was very promptly, though quietly, called to order by his\ndaughter, who was sitting in front of the platform between him and Lord\nLeighton. Franklin Marmion paused for a moment and smiled ever so\nfaintly. Nitocris looked round at the now eager audience a trifle\nanxiously, for she had a fairly clear idea of the trouble that might\npossibly be ahead. Her father went on as quietly as before:\n\n\"Of course, every one here is aware that the great Napoleon once said\nthat the word 'impossible' was not French. I need not remind such an\naudience as this that more than one distinguished student and\ninvestigator has suggested that it also may not be scientific.\"\n\nThe murmur broke out again, and Hoskins van Huysman blew his nose\nsomewhat aggressively. His scientific bile was beginning to rise. He\ndisapproved very strongly of the tone which his rival had begun. Its\nquiet confidence was somewhat ominous. The lecturer continued without\nthis time noticing the interruption, and proceeded to give a lengthy and\nlearned but singularly lucid _resum\u00e9_ of the more recent progress in the\nhigher mathematics and the deeply interesting speculations to which it\nhad given rise. This, with certain demonstrations which he made on the\ngreat black-board beside him, occupied nearly an hour. When he had\nfinished there was another murmur, which this time was wholly of\napplause, for this part of the lecture had not only been masterly but\nentirely orthodox. Then silence fell again, the silence of expectant\nwaiting, for every one felt that the \"Examination\" was coming now. He\nbegan again in a slightly altered voice.\n\n\"What I have just been saying was necessary to my subject as far as it\nwent, but for all that it was chiefly introductory to what I am now\ngoing to bring to your notice. But this is a matter rather for\nillustration and discussion than for mere disquisition. Therefore, to\nsave your time as much as possible, I will proceed at once to the\nillustration, and then we will have the discussion.\"\n\nProfessor van Huysman snorted again, even as a war-horse that snuffs the\nfray. This time Franklin Marmion seemed to recognise the implied\nchallenge, for he looked round the crowded theatre with a curious smile,\nwhich seemed to say: \"Yes, gentlemen, I see that some of you are getting\nready for a tussle. I am in hopes of being able to oblige you.\"\n\n\"Now,\" he continued, \"it is generally conceded that an ounce of practice\nis worth a good many pounds of precept, so I will get to the practice. I\nneed hardly remind you that ever since mathematics became an exact\nscience, three problems have been recognised as impossible of\nsolution--trisecting the triangle, squaring the circle, and doubling the\ncube. I have now the pleasure of announcing that I have had the great\ngood fortune to discover certain formul\u00e6 which, so far, at least, as I\ncan see, make the solution of those problems not only possible, but\ncomparatively easy--to those who know how to use them.\"\n\nAs he said this, Franklin Marmion looked directly at Hoskins van\nHuysman. He was the challenger now, and there was a glint in his eyes\nand a smile on his lips which showed that he meant business. The\nAmerican writhed, and had it not been for Brenda's gently but firmly\nrestraining hand, he might have jumped to his feet and precipitated\nmatters in a somewhat embarrassing fashion. The chairman looked up at\nthe lecturer with elevated eyelids which had a note of interrogation\nunder each of them, and then there came that sound of shifting in seats\nand breathing in many low keys which denotes that an audience has been\nwound up to a very tense pitch of expectation. If a smaller man had said\nsuch words to such hearers some one would have laughed, and then would\nhave burst forth a storm of derision. But the keenest critic had never\nfound Franklin Marmion wrong yet, and he had far too great a reputation\nto permit himself to say in such a place that which he did not seriously\nmean. So the hum died down as he went to the black-board, and Nitocris\nlooked at Merrill with something like fear in her eyes.\n\n\"If he does that,\" whispered Phadrig to the Prince in Russian, \"the\nstory that Pent-Ah and Neb-Anat told will be true--which the High Gods\nforbid!\"\n\n\"As the trisection of the triangle is, perhaps, the simplest of the\nthree problems,\" said the lecturer, with almost judicial calmness, \"we\nwill, if you please, begin with that. I hope that gentlemen who have\nbrought note-books with them will be kind enough to follow my\ncalculations and check any error that I may make.\"\n\nBut a good threescore note-books, pencils, and stylographic pens were\nout already, and hundreds of eyes were eagerly fastening their gaze on\nthe black-board, their owners desperately anxious to detect the first\nslip in the demonstration. The demonstrator drew an isosceles triangle\nrapidly, and without speaking filled the remainder of the board with\nformul\u00e6. The almost breathless silence was broken only by the click of\nthe chalk on the board and the scratching of pencils and pens on paper.\nWhen he had finished he ran through the calculations aloud, and said in\nthe most commonplace voice:\n\n\"Now, gentlemen, if, as I hope, you have found my working correct, I may\ndraw the two lines which will trisect the triangle.\"\n\nHe drew them, and then, as calmly as though he had done nothing more\nthan cross the much-trodden _pons asinorum_, he told two attendants to\ntake the board down and put it in front of the platform; then, while\nthey were lifting another on to the easel, he said:\n\n\"As those who have followed me would no doubt like a little time to\nrevise the figures, I will go on with the next problem, which will be\nour old friend, or enemy, the squaring of the circle.\"\n\nThe second board was filled with diagrams and formul\u00e6 as rapidly as the\nfirst.\n\n\"There is the demonstration, gentlemen,\" he said, as the attendants\nplaced it beside the other in full view of everybody. \"Now, as time is\nshortening, I will get on with the third problem.\"\n\nThe chalk began to click again, and the pens and pencils scratched on to\nthe accompaniment of murmurs and whispers and occasional grunts and\nsnorts of incredulity. By a master-stroke of strategy Franklin Marmion\nhad, in placing the three demonstrations of the long-supposed impossible\nbefore them in quick succession, kept the learned, but now utterly\nbewildered mathematicians so busy that they literally had not time to\nbegin \"the trouble\" which Brenda was now actually dreading. Her father's\nface, bent down over his note-book, was getting more terrible to look\nupon every moment. The mere fact that he had not uttered a sound since\nthe demonstrations had begun was sufficiently ominous, for it meant that\nhe was puzzled--perhaps even beaten--and if that was so, she dreaded to\neven imagine what might happen. On the other hand, Nitocris felt her\nspirits rising as she looked round and saw the many learned heads\nbending and shaking over the note-books, each owner of them working at\nhigh pressure to win the honour of first finding the error which all\nfirmly believed must exist, and which none of them could detect.\n\nWhen he had finished his third demonstration, Franklin Marmion, without\ninterrupting the hard thinking that was going on, took a chair by the\nside of the President, poured out a glass of water, and waited for\nresults.\n\n\"Marmion, what is this white magic that you have been springing upon\nus?\" whispered the presiding genius of the learned assembly, looking up\nfrom several sheets of paper which he had been rapidly covering with\nformul\u00e6. \"These things are impossible, you know--unless, of course, you\nhave got a good deal farther than any of us. And yet the calculations\nare correct as far as I can follow them, and no one else seems to have\nhit on any error yet. I must confess, though, that these progressives of\nyours are too deep for me. I can follow them, and yet I can't. At a\ncertain point they seem to elude me, and yet the calculations are\nrigidly right. It's almost enough to make one think you had done what\nCayley once told us in this room some one might do some day.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" replied Franklin Marmion, almost inaudibly, \"I began my\naddress by remarking, as you will remember, that perhaps, after all, the\nword 'impossible' might not be scientific.\"\n\nTheir eyes met, and the President, than whose there was no greater name\nin the higher realm of learning, saw something in Marmion's which sent a\nlittle chill through him, and that something told him that he was in the\npresence of a superior being.\n\n\"Dear me!\" he murmured, looking down at his papers again, \"the age of\nmiracles is not past, after all--in fact, it is only just beginning.\"\n\n\"It is re-beginning, my Lord--for us,\" came the reply, in a voice which\nseemed to come from very far away.\n\nThe President did not reply. As a matter of fact, he had no reply ready,\nand he had something else to do. He rose, and said in a somewhat\nconstrained voice:\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, Professor Marmion has shown us some very strange\ndemonstrations which have certainly amply justified the title which he\nselected. A good many gentlemen, and some ladies as well, I am glad to\nsee, have followed his calculations very carefully. I have done the same\nmyself, but I am bound to confess that I have not been able to find any\nerror. I think I shall be right in saying that no one will be more\npleased than the learned and--er--gifted lecturer to hear that some one\nelse has been able to do so.\"\n\nFranklin Marmion bowed his assent, and a faint smile flickered across\nhis clean-shaven lips. The next instant Professor van Huysman was on his\nlegs, note-book in one hand and stylo in the other. All the fresh colour\nhad gone out of his face; his eyes were burning, and his lips were\ntwitching with uncontrollable excitement.\n\n\"My Lord,\" he began, in a voice that even Brenda hardly recognised,\n\"like yourself, I have been unable to find any actual error in the\nlecturer's demonstrations of which I will take permission to call the\npossibility of the impossible; in other words, that a contradiction in\nterms can be true and false at one and the same time. That, my Lord, and\nladies, and gentlemen,\" he went on, raising his voice almost to a\nshout, \"is still, and, I hope, in the interests of true science, and not\nadroit jugglery with figures and formul\u00e6, will ever remain, another\nimpossibility. Professor Marmion has apparently trisected the triangle,\nsquared the circle, and doubled the cube. It may be that he has\npersuaded some present that he really has done so; but, again, in the\ninterests of science, I desire to protest against the way in which these\ndemonstrations have been sprung upon us. Calculations which he has\ndoubtless taken months to elaborate, he has asked us to test in a few\nminutes. For myself, I decline to accept them as true, and I hope that\nothers will do the same until we have had time to satisfy ourselves that\nthe hitherto impossible has been made possible.\"\n\nHe sat down, breathing hard and white with anger and excitement, and\nthen the trouble began. The trisectors, the circle-squarers, and the\ncube-doublers, had seen their long-flouted theories proved to\ndemonstration by one of the most learned and responsible men of science\nin the world, and one of their most sarcastic and hitherto successful\nflouters had been compelled to confess that he could find no flaw in the\ncalculations of this mathematical Daniel so unexpectedly come to\njudgment. They did not understand his proofs, but that was no reason why\nthey should reject them, and so they rose as one man in support of their\nchampion to demand that Professor van Huysman should withdraw his\nimputations of jugglery. He sat still, and shook his head. He was too\ndisgusted and bewildered to do or say anything more until he had made a\nsearching analysis of these diabolical formul\u00e6.\n\nBut there were others who wanted to have their say in defence of\nscientific orthodoxy, and they had it--and the rest was a chaos of\nintellectual conflict until, at the end of nearly an hour, the\nPresident, who now saw with clearer eyes than any of the disputants,\nrose and put an end to the discussion by remarking that they had not the\nwhole night before them, and that all that Professor Marmion had said\nand done would be published in the scientific papers; further, that such\na controversy would perhaps be more profitably conducted in print than\nby word of mouth. Such a course would give every one ample leisure to\nwork out the problems in the light of the new demonstrations, and also\ngive a much better prospect of reaching a logical, and therefore just,\nconclusion than a discussion in which haste, and possibly pre-conceived\nopinions, from the influence of which no human being was really free,\ncould possibly promise.\n\nThis, of course, put an end to the matter for the time being, and, after\nthe usual votes of thanks and acknowledgments, the distinguished company\ndispersed--amused, mystified, gratified, bewildered, and exasperated:\nbut, saving only four of its members, with no idea of the effect which\nthat evening's proceedings were destined to have upon the fate of\nEurope, perhaps of the whole human race.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nTHE ADVANCEMENT OF NITOCRIS--THE RESOLVE OF OSCAROVITCH\n\n\nFranklin Marmion and Hoskins van Huysman parted that evening in what may\nbe described as a state of armed neutrality, but with more cordiality\nthan Brenda, at any rate, had hoped for. Still, they were both\ngentlemen, and, moreover, the American scientist was honestly looking\nforward to the discovery of some fatal flaw in the reasoning of his\nEnglish rival which should leave the final triumph with him--and such a\ntriumph would be not only final but crushing.\n\nBrenda whirled her father and Lord Leighton--who, of course, sat beside\nher in front as she drove--off to supper; Merrill went to his club to\nruminate happily for an hour; and the hero of the evening and his\ndaughter drove home almost in silence, and it was a silence for which\nthere was a very sufficient reason. Such people do not talk about\ntrivialities when they are thinking about much more serious concerns.\n\nAfter supper Nitocris followed her father into the study, as he quite\nexpected her to do, and when she had shut the door, she faced him and\nsaid in a voice that was not quite her own:\n\n\"Dad, there seems to me to be only one explanation of what you did\nto-night. I know enough mathematics to see that it is the only one. If\nyou tell me that I am wrong, of course I shall believe you--and then I\nshall ask you how else you did it.\"\n\nAs she spoke he felt that his soul was asking itself a momentous\nquestion. She had guessed--or did she already know?--the Great Secret.\nAnd, if either, was she herself near enough to the dividing line between\nthe two worlds for him to tell her the truth?\n\nHe sat down in the chair before his writing-table and stared hard at his\nplotting-pad for a few moments. Then he looked up at her and saw the\nanswer.\n\n\"Niti,\" he said slowly, and with a little halt between the words, \"you\nhave asked me a question which I think some one else must answer, if it\ncan be answered at all. Look behind you!\"\n\nShe turned swiftly, and there, almost beside her, stood--not the Mummy,\nbut the Queen, her living other-self, royal-robed and crowned as she had\nbeen in the dim past, which was now again the present.\n\nWould she flinch or faint, or cry out with fear? If her unconscious feet\nhad not advanced very near to the Border she would certainly do one or\nthe other. Indeed, it was with an inward quaking of fear for her that\nher father had told her to turn. It might well have meant the difference\nbetween sanity and insanity, knowing what she already did of the Mummy\nand its mysterious disappearance. But no: there before his eyes was\nworked again the miracle which had already been worked in his own case,\nthough now it was, if possible, even more marvellous than it had been\nbefore. As Nitocris turned she uttered a low cry of wonder and\nrecognition, and held out both hands to her other twin-self. The Queen\ntook them, and said in the Ancient Tongue, which now she understood\nagain after many centuries:\n\n\"Welcome, thou who wast once myself, into this larger life to which the\nPerfect Knowledge hath led thee: where Time is not, and that which was,\nand is, and shall be are the same! Thou hast yet many days, as men call\nthem, to live in that limited life known as mortal, and so the mortal\nlot, with its perils and sorrows and joys, shall yet be thine: yet,\nalthough, if the High Gods will it so, that life shall end and begin and\nend again many times, thou hast already won through the shadows which\nbound that little life into the light of the Day which knows not dawn\nnor noon nor night. I who was, and thou who art, are one again!\"\n\nThen came silence. Franklin Marmion saw the two kindred shapes merge\ninto each other. He closed his eyes for a moment, as he thought, and\nwhen he opened them again he was alone. He looked at the clock, and saw\nthat it was after four.\n\n\"Dear me!\" he said, getting up with a shake of his shoulders, \"I must\nhave fallen asleep. Where's Niti? Why, of course, she has been in bed\nfor hours, and it's about time that I got there, too.\"\n\nWhen they met before breakfast Nitocris said to him:\n\n\"I had a very strange experience last night, Dad. I either saw, or\ndreamt I saw, the Mummy alive again, robed and crowned like a queen of\nancient Egypt; and then we seemed to become the same person, and I\nremembered that I had been Queen Nitocris of Egypt once. Then I found\nmyself alone--so very much alone--in a new world which was still like\nthis one, only there wasn't any time. I had another sense which made me\nable to see past, present, and future all at once, and here and there,\nand up and down, and something else were all the same, and yet it did\nnot seem in the slightest strange to me, so I suppose it was a dream.\"\n\n\"It was no dream, Niti,\" said her father, looking at her with grave\neyes. \"Last night, as we have to say in the state of Three Dimensions,\nyou had your first glimpse of the state of Four. I saw what you did.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" she replied, without any sign of astonishment. \"Then that is why I\nwas able to understand your demonstrations last night when all the rest\nwere puzzled. I didn't think I quite did then, however, but I see now\nthat I did. And so I and Her Majesty are really one and the same! It\nought to seem very wonderful, but somehow it doesn't in the slightest.\"\n\n\"I don't think that anything will seem wonderful to you now, Niti,\" was\nthe quiet response. \"But as we are at present on the lower plane of\nexistence, it will be necessary for us to go to breakfast.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOscarovitch and Phadrig went back after the lecture to the Prince's flat\nin Royal Court Mansions, which, as a bachelor and a bird of passage, he\nfound much more convenient in many ways than a house. He ordered his\nRussian servant to make coffee for his guest, and mixed a stiff\nbrandy-and-soda for himself. He wanted it, for the experiences of the\nevening had shaken even his nerves not a little. He was essentially a\nman of power, both physically and mentally, of boundless ambitions and\niron will, vast knowledge of the world, as he knew it, and of very high\nintellectual attainments; but the cast of his mind was absolutely\nmaterial, and therefore he both hated and feared anything which appeared\nto transcend the material plane to which his mental vision was at\npresent entirely confined.\n\nWhen the servant had left the room after bringing the coffee, he gave\nPhadrig a cigar, lit one himself, and said through the first puffs of\nsmoke:\n\n\"Phadrig, you know, or pretend to know, more about these things than I\ndo, or want to do: but, still, just now I want you to tell me honestly\nif you believe that Professor Marmion did really solve those problems\nto-night. I ask you because I admit that the solutions went beyond the\nrange of my mathematics.\"\n\n\"Highness,\" replied the Egyptian, speaking slowly and almost reverently,\n\"he did. There is not, I think, another man on earth now who could have\ndone so; but for those who had eyes to see there could be no doubt, and\nyou will find that, though he has many rivals and will have countless\ncritics, not one will be able either to explain his solutions or find a\nflaw in them.\"\n\n\"You did a few things that I should not have thought possible the other\nday, which you claimed to be really miracles. Now, if they were, I\nsuppose you can explain Professor Marmion's?\"\n\n\"There are no miracles, Highness: only the results of higher knowledge\nthan that which they who see them possess. That is why what I did seemed\nlike miracles to those who watched. But this Franklin Marmion, as he is\ncalled in this life, has attained to a higher knowledge than mine,\nwherefore I am able only to understand imperfectly, but not myself to\ndo, that which he does. Yet, as the High Gods live, he did this thing;\nand to do it he must have passed to the higher life through the gate of\nthe Perfect Knowledge.\"\n\n\"In other words,\" said the Prince, after a big gulp of his\nbrandy-and-soda, \"that he has solved that infernal problem of the fourth\ndimension you have had so much to say about. Now, granted that he has\ndone so, what does it amount to as regards our world--the world of\npractical thought and real action, I mean?\"\n\n\"All thought is practical, Highness,\" replied Phadrig, \"since there can\nbe no action which is intelligent without thought. Wherefore, the higher\nthe thought the more potent the action, and so he who has the Perfect\nKnowledge has also the Perfect Power.\"\n\n\"Then, do you mean to tell me seriously--and I can hardly think that you\nwould trifle with me--that this man is now practically omnipotent, as\nfar as we lower beings, as you seem to call us, are concerned?\"\n\n\"Only the High Gods are omnipotent, Your Excellency; but, if I have seen\nrightly, he is as a god to us of the lower life, and therefore I would\npray you again to utterly relinquish your lately and, as I have dared\nfor your sake to say, rashly-formed designs to make the Queen who was,\nand his daughter that is, the sharer of your future throne. Is not the\nPrincess Hermia noble and fair enough?\"\n\n\"No, by all your gods, no!\" exclaimed the Prince passionately. \"Since I\nhave seen the woman who, as you say, was once Queen of Egypt, there is,\nand shall be, no other consort for me. And who are you to advise me\nthus? Are you still the same man who made the condition that, if you\nused your arts, whatever they may be, to place her in my power, she\nshould be, not only my Empress, but also Queen of Egypt? What has\nchanged you? What has made you faithless to the promise that you gave\nme in exchange for mine? If you have forgotten that, do not also forget\nthat we Russians have a short way with traitors.\"\n\n\"What has changed me, Highness,\" replied Phadrig, ignoring the threat,\n\"is the knowledge that I have gained to-night. Though you believe me or\nnot, the debt which I owe you makes it my duty to warn you. The matter\nstands thus: Nitocris, the daughter of Franklin Marmion, was the Queen.\nFor all I know, she also may have attained to the higher life, and is\ntherefore the Queen still, though that is a mystery beyond my\ncomprehension; but I do know now that her father has attained to it, and\nthat for this reason, unless you put this new-found love out of your\nheart, you will bring yourself within the sphere of this man's power--a\npower mighty enough to wreck every scheme you have ever shaped, and to\ndoom you to a fate more horrible than mortal brain could conceive. You\nwould be as a man who strove against a god.\"\n\n\"You may believe what you are saying, Phadrig, and I dare say you do,\"\nexclaimed the Prince again. \"I don't, because I can't; but even if I\ndid, I would claim your promise. I love this Nitocris, Queen or woman,\nand neither man nor god shall keep her from me, willing or unwilling. As\nfor the Princess Hermia--well, her husband is not dead yet.\"\n\n\"Better he dead and his widow your wife, as was planned, Highness, than\nthat you should dare the power of one who has attained to the Perfect\nKnowledge,\" said the Egyptian, with all the earnestness of absolute\nconviction. \"But my duty is done. I have warned you of that which you\ncannot see for yourself. I have done it to my own sorrow and the\ndestroying of my own dream; but my promise is given, and I will keep it,\neven to a fate that may be worse than death.\"\n\nThe Prince drained his glass and laughed.\n\n\"Well said, my ages-old adept, as you think you are! You shall follow\nme, for I will go on now even to death, or what there may be worse\nbehind it, if I can only take my beautiful Queen with me. Yes, I swear I\nwill, by God--if there is one!\"\n\nSo by his ignorant blasphemy Oscar Oscarovitch, who once was Lord of War\nin Egypt, for the love of the same woman, fixed his fate for this life,\nand for many that were to come after it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nTHE MYSTERY OF PRINCE ZASTROW\n\n\nEvents now began to move with an almost bewildering rapidity, at least,\nso far as they affected the immediate temporal concerns of Nitocris and\nher father. For days and weeks a furious storm raged round the famous\nlecture, and the atmosphere of the scientific world was thick with\nfigures and formul\u00e6, diagrams and disquisitions; but since none of the\nlearned disputators proved himself capable of detecting the slightest\nflaw in the lecturer's mathematics, it had very little interest for him,\nand therefore has none for us. In fact, so little did he seem concerned\nwith the tempest he had raised, that a few days later, to the\nastonishment and chagrin of his baffled critics, he and Nitocris bade\nadieu to their more intimate friends and disappeared on a wandering trip\nof undetermined destination for change of air and scene and a\nmuch-needed holiday for the over-worked Professor. At least, that is the\nreason which Nitocris gave to Lord Leighton and the Van Huysmans, and\nthe few others to whom she thought it necessary to give any explanation\nat all.\n\nThe day before they left, Merrill lunched at \"The Wilderness,\" took a\nfitting leave of his lady-love and his prospective father-in-law, and\ndeparted to join his ship, slightly mystified, perhaps, by recent\nhappenings, but still believing himself with sufficient reason to be the\nhappiest and most fortunate Lieutenant-Commander in the British Navy.\n\nThe true reasons for the sudden departure of the now more than ever\nfamous Professor and his beautiful daughter from the scene of his latest\nand most marvellous triumph may be set forth as follows:\n\nOn the evening of the third day after the lecture Franklin Marmion was\ngoing back by train to Wimbledon after a long day at the British Museum\namong the relics of Egyptian antiquity--which, as may well be\nunderstood, he studied now with an interest of which no other man living\ncould have been capable; and as soon as he was seated in a comfortable\ncorner, and had his pipe going, he opened his _Pall Mall Gazette_, and,\nas was his wont on such occasions, began with the leading article and\nread straight along through the Special Article and the Occ. Notes,\nuntil he came to the news of the day, skipping only the financial news\nand quotations, which, under his present changed conditions of\nexistence, he dare not trust himself to read lest he might be tempted by\nthe unrighteousness of Mammon, a form of idolatry which he had always\nheartily despised.\n\nThe first item on the news page was headed in bold type:\n\n\n      ~\"MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE OF A\n      RULING GERMAN PRINCE.\n\n      \"SUSPICION OF FOUL PLAY.\n\n      \"IMPORTANT STATE PAPERS VANISH WITH\n      HIM.--SPECIAL.~\n\n     \"In spite of the most rigorous censorship of the Press Bureau, it\n     has now become a matter of practical certainty that Prince Emil\n     Rudolf von Zastrow, the youthful and very capable ruler of Boravia,\n     who, during the last two or three years, has become one of the most\n     brilliant figures in European society, has disappeared under\n     circumstances so strangely mysterious as to suggest some analogy\n     with the tragedy of which the unhappy Prince Alexander of Bulgaria\n     was the central figure.\n\n     \"The facts, so far as they have been ascertained, are briefly as\n     follows:--Up to about a fortnight ago, the Prince was living in\n     semi-retirement with his consort, the Princess Hermia, in his\n     picturesque Castle of Trelitz, which, as every one knows, looks\n     down over the waters of the Baltic from a solitary eminence of rock\n     which rises out of the vast forests that cover the rolling plains\n     for leagues on the landward sides. It will be remembered that every\n     year since his accession, the Prince has been wont to retire to\n     this famous hunting-ground of his to enjoy at once the pleasures of\n     the chase and the society of his beautiful young consort in peace\n     and solitude after the whirl of the European winter season. As far\n     as is known, the only guests at the Castle were the Count Ulik von\n     Kessner, High Chamberlain of Boravia, who is believed to have been\n     present on business of State, and Captain Alexis Vollmar, of the\n     55th Caucasus Regiment, at present attached to the Imperial\n     Headquarter Staff at St Petersburg. Captain Vollmar, in addition to\n     being a brilliant young officer, is also a scion of two of the\n     wealthiest and most aristocratic families in Russia.\n\n     \"It is now fully established that on the evening of the 6th of this\n     month--that is to say, nearly three weeks ago--the Prince and his\n     two guests returned after a long day in the forest, and that the\n     Prince retired to rest very shortly before supper. From that day to\n     this he has never been seen, either at home or in society. What\n     makes the disappearance more strangely striking is the fact that\n     the Prince, who is Colonel of the 28th Pommeranian Regiment, did\n     not put in an appearance at the recent review in the Kaiserhof when\n     the German Emperor held his usual inspection. Although it was\n     obvious that His Majesty was both puzzled and annoyed by his\n     absence, no official explanation of it has been given, and all\n     information on the subject is rigidly withheld. Our own comes from\n     a personal friend, and, as far as it goes, may be absolutely relied\n     upon.\"\n\nFor some reason or other, which, after his recent experiences, he\nthought it would be as well not to try and fathom for the present, these\nfew paragraphs made a strangely persistent impression on him. When he\ngot home he gave his evening papers as usual to his daughter, and at\ndinner the Zastrow mystery was the chief, in fact almost the only, topic\nof conversation.\n\n\"Yes, it certainly is very extraordinary,\" said Nitocris. \"The papers\nmake mysteries enough out of the disappearance, of the most everyday,\ninsignificant persons, who were probably only running away from their\ndebts or their domestic troubles, but for a real Prince to utterly\nvanish like this--that certainly looks like a little more than an\nordinary mystery. And I suppose,\" she went on, after a little interval\nof silence, \"if there really has been foul play--I mean, granted that\nPrince Charming, as all the Society papers got to call him, has been\nspirited away for some hidden reason of State or politics and is never\nintended to see the light of day again, who knows how many secrets may\nbe connected with this affair which might be like matches in a powder\nmagazine? And--Oh yes--why, Dad, it was this same Prince Zastrow who has\nbeen mentioned by most of the best European papers as the only possible\nElective Tsar of Russia if the Romanoffs are driven out by the\nRevolution, and the people go back to the old Constitution. In fact,\nsome of them went so far as to say that nothing but his selection could\nprevent a scramble for the fragments of Russia which could only end in\ngeneral conflagration.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course I do,\" replied her father. \"But what an atrocious shame,\nif it is so! One of the most popular of the minor princes of Europe\nspirited away, and perhaps either murdered or thrown into some prison or\nfortress, where he will drag out his days and nights in solitude until\nhe goes mad: a young, bright, promising life ruined, just because he\nhappens to stand in the way of some unscrupulous ambition, or vile\npolitical intrigue!\n\n\"It would be a crime of the very first magnitude, that is to say, of the\nmost villainous description, and all the more horrible because it would\nbe committed by people in the highest of places. Really, Niti, it is\nenough to make one think that there ought to be some higher power in the\nworld capable of making these political crimes impossible. The inner\nhistory of European politics--I mean, the history that doesn't get into\nbooks or newspapers--would, I am certain, prove that quite half the wars\nof the world, at least during the period of what we are pleased to call\ncivilisation, would have been avoided if some means could have been\nfound of putting an end to the miserable personal ambitions and\njealousies which have never anything to do with the welfare of nations,\nbut quite the reverse. I shouldn't wonder if poor Prince Zastrow has\nbeen the victim of something of the sort. It is quite possible that\nexpiring Tsardom had a finger in the pie. At any rate, there was a\nRussian officer in the Castle the day he disappeared. I should very much\nlike to see the sort of explanation _he_ could give of the affair, if he\nchose.\"\n\n\"But is there not such a power in the world now, Dad?\" asked Nitocris,\nlooking across the table at him with a peculiar smile.\n\nHe looked back in silence for a moment or two. Then he replied slowly:\n\n\"I see what you mean, Niti. Of course, I suppose we shall be able to\nread each other's thoughts now, or even converse without speaking, or\nwhen we are out of earshot of each other. The same idea came to me while\nI was reading the account of this affair in the train; but should I, or,\nrather we, be doing right in interfering actively in the transactions,\npolitical and otherwise, of the world--by which I mean, of course, the\nstate of three dimensions? It would be a terrific responsibility.\nRemember what tremendous powers we are capable of wielding by simply--it\nis so very simple now--simply transferring our personalities to the\nhigher plane. What if we were to do wrong? We might involve the whole\nworld in some unspeakable catastrophe.\"\n\n\"And which do _you_ consider to be the greatest catastrophe, or, perhaps\nI ought rather to say the greatest evil, that has ever afflicted the\nworld, Dad?\" she asked, with just a suspicion of a smile in her eyes,\nthough her lips were perfectly serious.\n\n\"Oh, war, of course!\" he replied, with his usual emphasis when he got on\nto that topic. \"What was I saying only just now about personal intrigues\nand ambitions that make war? What have I always thought about war? It is\nthe most appalling curse----\"\n\n\"Then, Dad,\" she interrupted in her sweetest tones, \"do you think that,\nsupposing we possess these wonderful powers, they could be better used\nthan in preventing any war which may possibly arise out of this\ndisappearance of Prince Zastrow, and so convincing those who are wicked\nenough to plunge the human race into blood and misery that henceforth\nall wars of aggression and ambition will be impossible?\"\n\n\"Yes, you are right as usual, Niti,\" he exclaimed, getting up. \"Now you\ngo and think about it all, and give me your advice in the morning. I\nwant to get away now and work out an intelligible solution of those\nthree problems--if I can make it so--for the benefit of Van Huysman and\nthe rest of my respected critics. When I've done that, we'll be off to\nthe Continent or somewhere----\"\n\n\"And see what we can make of the Zastrow Mystery, perhaps!\" said\nNitocris. \"Good-night, Dad. I want to do some thinking, too.\"\n\nHe went to his study and set to work upon a development of the\ndemonstrations with which he had astounded not only London, but the\nwhole civilised world.\n\nBut it was no good to-night. The ideas would not come. Over and over\nagain he picked up the threads of his arguments, only to drop them\nagain. At last, in something like wondering despair, he muttered:\n\n\"Confound the thing! I almost had it last night, and now I seem as far\naway from it as ever. What on earth can be the matter with me?\"\n\nHe put his elbows on the table, took his head between his hands, and\nstared down at the pages covered with angles and circles, chords and\ncurves, and wildernesses of symbols, which were scattered about his\ndesk. As he stared at them they seemed somehow to come together, and the\nlines and curves arranged themselves in symmetrical shapes, until they\ndeveloped from diagrams into pictures; and as they did so he found\nhimself forgetting all about the problems, and thinking only of the\nstrange vision which seemed to be unfolding itself among the scattered\npapers before him. The straight lines became the walls and turrets of\none of those two-or three-hundred-year-old German country houses, half\ncastle, half mansion, which every explorer of the bye-paths of the\nFatherland has seen and admired so often. The curves became long,\nsweeping stretches of sandy bays, fringed with other curves of breaking\nrollers; and as the picture grew more distinct, one great circle\nembraced a whole perfect picture of land and seascape--land dusky and\nforest-covered in the southward half; and the misty sea, island-dotted,\nwind-whipped, and foam-flecked, to the northward.\n\nThe castle stood on the top of a somewhat steeply sloping hill about\nfive hundred feet above the sandy shore, on which the breakers were\ncurling a couple of miles away. The hill was covered with thick-growing\nfirs from the plain to the castle wall, but two broad avenues ran in\nstraight lines, one to seaward, and the other down into the depths of\nthe vast forest, until it opened on to the post road, which afforded the\nonly practicable carriage route to the station of Trelitz on the main\nBerlin-K\u00f6nigsberg Railway.\n\nThe longer he looked, the more surprisingly distinct the picture became,\nand, curiously enough, the less his wonder grew. He saw three men on\nhorseback riding at a canter up the avenue from the forest. Their\ncostumes showed plainly enough that they had just come back from the\nchase. As they rode on they seemed to come quite close to him, until he\ncould see their features with perfect distinctness. By the changing\nexpression of their faces he could tell they were laughing and chatting;\nbut, singularly enough, he could not hear a word that they were saying,\nwhich, considering the minuteness with which he saw everything, struck\nhim as being distinctly curious.\n\nHe watched them ride up to the old Gothic gateway in the wall which ran\nround the castle, suiting itself to the irregularities of the hill. They\ncrossed the courtyard and dismounted. The grooms led their horses away,\nand, as the big double doors opened, they went in, one of them, standing\naside for the younger of his companions but entering before the other.\nIn the great hall whose walls were adorned with horns and heads and\ntusks, and whose floor was almost completely carpeted with skins, they\ngave their weapons to a couple of footmen; and as they did so he saw the\nslim and yet stately figure of a woman coming down the winding stair\nwhich led into the hall from a broad gallery running round it. As she\nreached the bottom of the stairway she threw her head back a little, and\nheld out both her hands towards the man who had come in second. As the\nlight of a great swinging lamp above the stairway fell upon her upturned\nface, he recognised the Countess Hermia von Zastrow, the reigning\nEuropean beauty whose portrait in the illustrated papers, and in the\ngreat photographer's windows, was almost as familiar as that of Queen\nAlexandra.\n\nThe Count--for the handsome young hunter who now took her hands could\nnow be no other than the Prince of Boravia-Trelitz--raised her right\nhand in courtly fashion to his lips. The other two bowed low before her,\nand then she led the way up the stairs.\n\nHe saw all this as distinctly as though he had been actually present,\nand yet none of the party seemed to take the slightest notice of him.\nBut he was getting quite accustomed to miracle-working now, and so he\naccepted the extraordinary conditions of his visions, or whatever it\nwas, with more interest than astonishment. He followed them up the\nstairs and along the right hand side of the gallery. The Count opened a\ndoor of heavy black oak and stood aside for his Countess to enter. Again\nthe younger of his companions went first, and again he followed; then,\nas the elder man entered and closed the door, the scene was blotted out\nas though a sudden darkness had fallen upon his eyes.\n\n\"Dear me!\" he said, getting up and rubbing his temples with both hands.\n\"If I hadn't had so many extraordinary experiences since my promotion to\nthe plane of N4, I should probably be a little scared as well. But it\nis really astonishing how soon the trained intellect gets accustomed to\nanything--even the eccentricities of the fourth dimensional world.\nWell, well! I hope that's not the end of the adventure, I was getting\nquite interested. I suppose this must be in some obscure way the reason\nwhy those paragraphs in the _Pall Mall_ interested me so strangely.\"\n\nHe walked towards the window, pulled the blind aside and looked out. But\ninstead of his own tree-shaded lawn and the wide expanse of moonlit\ncommon beyond which he expected to see, he found himself looking, as it\nwere, through a window from the outside into a great, oak-panelled\nsleeping chamber, lighted by a huge silver lamp hanging from the middle\nof the painted and corniced ceiling. Against the middle of the left hand\nside wall, as he was looking into the room, stood one of the huge,\nheavily-draped, four-post bedsteads in which the great ones of the earth\nwere wont to take their rest a couple of hundred years ago. The curtains\nwere drawn back on both sides. In the middle of the bed lay Count\nZastrow, deathly white, with fast-closed eyes and lips, breathing\nheavily as the rise and fall of the embroidered sheet and silken\ncoverlet which lay across his chest showed. On the right hand side stood\nthe Countess and the two men whom he had seen before; on the other side\nstood a tall, strikingly handsome woman, whose dark imperious features\nseemed strangely at variance with the severely fashioned grey dress and\nthe plainly arranged hair which proclaimed her either a nurse or an\nupper servant.\n\nHe saw the elder of the two men lean over the bed and raise one of the\nsleeper's eyelids with his thumb. The nurse took up a lighted taper by\nthe table beside her and passed it in front of the opened eye. The man\nclosed the eyelid, and turned and said something to the Countess and the\nother man. The Countess nodded and smiled, not quite as a man likes to\nsee a woman smile, and, with a swift glance at the motionless figure on\nthe bed, turned away and left the room. The nurse said something to the\ntwo men, and as the door closed behind her the scene changed again.\n\nThis time he was not looking into a window, but out of one. He was\ngazing over a vast expanse of forest pierced by a broad, straight road\nwhich led for several miles, as it seemed to him, between two dark walls\nof thickly-growing pines until it ended abruptly with the forest and\nopened out on a tiny sand-fringed inlet whose narrow mouth was guarded\nby two little outcrops of rock half a mile to seaward.\n\nA carriage drawn by four black horses rolled rapidly along the road,\nswung out on to the beach, and stopped. Almost at the same moment a\ngrey-painted, six-oared boat grounded on the sandy beach. A couple of\nmen landed from her, and as the carriage door opened, they saluted. The\nCount's two guests got out and the others entered the carriage, then one\nof them got out again followed by the other, and between them they\ncarried a limp, motionless human form completely covered by a great rug\nof dark fur. It was taken to the boat. All embarked, and the pinnace\nshot away out through the little headlands. A mile out to seaward lay\nthe long black shape of a torpedo destroyer. The pinnace ran alongside\nand they all went on board, two of the sailors carrying the body as\nbefore.\n\nProfessor Marmion found himself accompanying them. The body was taken\ninto a little cabin and laid in a berth. The rug was turned down from\nthe face, and he recognised Prince Zastrow. A few minutes later he found\nhimself in the main cabin of the destroyer. The two men who had come in\nthe carriage were sitting at a little table with a man in mufti. This\nman raised his head and said something. He did not hear the words--but,\nto his amazement, he recognised the handsome face as that of Prince\nOscarovitch, whom he had never seen before he came as his guest to the\ngarden-party at \"The Wilderness.\"\n\nOn the bulkhead of the cabin at the Prince's head there hung a little\nblock-calendar, and the exposed leaf showed the date, Monday, 6th June.\nAs he read it an impulse caused him to look round at the calendar\nstanding upon his own mantel-shelf. It showed the date, Friday, 24th\nJune. He turned back to the window and saw nothing but his own lawn and\nthe moonlit Common beyond.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nM. NICOL HENDRY\n\n\nFranklin Marmion sat down and began to think the situation over. It was\nnot an easy one, for, as it appeared to him, it would be very difficult,\nif not impossible, for Nitocris and himself to help in the elucidation\nof the Zastrow mystery, and the prevention of any European complications\nthat might arise out of it, on both the higher and the lower planes of\nexistence. Of course, it would have been perfectly easy to do so in one\nsense, for now, practically nothing in human affairs was impossible of\nachievement to them; but, on the other hand, it would never do to allow\npeople on the lower plane to become aware of their extra-human powers.\nThis was out of the question for many reasons, not the least of which\nwas that they had their lives to live under the ordinary conditions of\ntime and space and among their fellow-mortals, every one of whom would\nshun them in fear, perhaps even horror, if they knew their secret. What,\nfor instance, would happen to Nitocris in her temporal state if even\nonly Merrill came to know it? No, the idea was certainly beyond the\npossibility of consideration.\n\nAt the same time, it was to some extent necessary that they should work\non both planes if they were to reap the full advantage of their recently\nacquired powers, and out of this dilemma there appeared to be only one\nway open to the Professor: he must have the assistance of others to do\non the lower plane the work that he would, as it were, direct from the\nhigher. The question was, who? Obviously it must be some one upon whose\ndiscretion absolute reliance could be placed. He must be highly skilled\nin police work, and have a reputation to enhance or lose as the result\nmight decide. Suddenly a name occurred to him. A short time ago his\nfriend the President had been telling him the inner story of a very\nintricate case which had involved a scandal of two Courts. Only the most\nmeagre details had obviously been permitted to appear in the papers, but\nHis Lordship had told him that it had been solved and settled almost\nentirely by the skill and diplomacy of a M. Nicol Hendry, who held the\nlittle advertised but highly responsible position of Head of the English\nDepartment of the International Police Bureau.\n\n\"That's the very man,\" he said, \"the very man, and I shouldn't wonder if\nhe's engaged on this particular case. It's too late to wire, and,\nbesides, that would look suspicious. I could telephone to Scotland Yard,\nbut I don't want even the police to know I want him until I've seen him.\nNo, I'll write a note: it will go by the early post, and no one will\nknow where it comes from.\"\n\nJust as lunch was over the next day the front door bell tingled, and\npresently the parlour-maid knocked, and came in with a card on a silver\nsalver:\n\n\"I have shown the gentleman into the drawing-room, sir. He says that he\nhas an appointment with you for half-past two.\"\n\n\"Very well: I will be up in a moment, Annie.\" Then, as she closed the\ndoor, he gave Nitocris the card, and continued: \"Our ally on the lower\nplane that may be. You say you wouldn't care to be present and help me\nwith your opinion?\"\n\n\"Oh no, Dad. I don't want any one to know that I am taking any part in\nthis little adventure. But if you will introduce him afterwards, I'll\ntell you what I think. You know, women generally judge other people that\nway.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" laughed her father, as he turned to the door, \"that will be\nbest. If everything goes right and I think I can work with him, I shall\nbring him upstairs and you can give him a cup of tea. If I don't, you\nwill know that he won't do.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, then, for the present,\" she smiled, \"and don't frighten the\npoor man, if you can help it. I dare say he's only an exaggerated\npoliceman, after all.\"\n\nBut it was a very different sort of person whom Franklin Marmion greeted\nin the drawing-room. M. Nicol Hendry was a slimly but strongly-built man\nof about forty. His high, somewhat narrow forehead was framed with\nclose-cut, crinkly, reddish-brown hair. Under well-defined brown\neyebrows shone a pair of alert steel-grey eyes of almost startling\nbrilliancy. His nose was a trifle long and slightly aquiline. A\ncarefully-trained golden-brown moustache half-concealed firm, thinly-cut\nlips, and a closely-trimmed, pointed beard just revealed the strength of\nthe chin beneath. He was dressed in a dark grey frock-coat suit, and\nwore a pinky-red wild rose, which he had plucked on the Common, in his\nbutton-hole. As he shook hands with him the Professor made a mental note\nof him as an embodiment of strength, keenness, and quiet inflexibility:\na summing-up which was pretty near the truth.\n\n\"Good afternoon, M. Hendry,\" he said, as the hands and eyes met.\n\n\"Good afternoon, Professor,\" returned the other in a gentle voice, and\nalmost perfect English. \"May I ask to what happy circumstance--at least,\nI hope it is a happy one--I owe the honour of making the acquaintance of\nthe gentleman who has succeeded in mystifying all the mathematicians of\nEurope?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Franklin Marmion with a smile, \"I don't know whether there\nis so very much honour about that, but I do know that your time is very\nvaluable and that I have already taken up a good deal of it by bringing\nyou all the way out here, so I will come to the point at once. But wait\na moment. Come down into my study. We can talk more comfortably there.\"\nWhen the Professor had given his guest a cigar and lit his pipe, he\nsaid quite abruptly: \"It is about the Zastrow affair.\"\n\nIf he had said it was about the last Grand Ducal plot in the Peterhof,\nM. Hendry could not have been inwardly more astonished. Outwardly the\nProfessor might have mentioned the last commonplace murder. Only his\neyelids lifted a little as he replied:\n\n\"Ah, indeed? Well, really, Professor, you must forgive me for saying\nthat that is about the very last matter I should have expected you to\nhave brought up. All the world knows you as one of its most\ndistinguished men of science, now, of course, more distinguished than\never; but I hardly think any one would have expected you to interest\nyourself in political mysteries. I have a recollection of hearing or\nreading somewhere that politics were your pet aversion.\"\n\n\"So they are,\" replied Franklin Marmion, with a short laugh. \"I consider\nordinary politics--juggling with phrases to delude the ignorance and\nflatter the prejudices of the mob, and bartering principles for place\nand power--to be about the most contemptible vocation a man can descend\nto, but those are low politics in more senses than one. Now high\npolitics, as a psychological study, to an outsider are a very different\nmatter. But I am digressing. I did not invite you here to discuss\ntrivialities like these. I want to ask you--of course, you will not\nanswer me unless you like--whether you are connected, professionally or\notherwise, with the Zastrow affair?\"\n\nM. Hendry looked down at the toes of his perfectly-shaped boots for a\nmoment or two. Then he raised his head and said good-humouredly:\n\n\"Professor, I know that there is no more honourable man in the world\nthan you, but even from you I must ask frankly your reasons for asking\nthat question?\"\n\n\"You have a perfect right to do that, my dear sir,\" was the quiet reply.\n\"If you say 'yes,' I am anxious to help you: if you say 'no,' I should\nlike you to help me: if you don't care to answer, there is an end of the\nmatter. Those are my reasons.\"\n\nIt took a good deal to astonish Nicol Hendry, but he was considerably\nastonished now. Yet it was impossible to have the remotest doubt of\nFranklin Marmion's absolute earnestness. But why should he of all men on\nearth want to unravel the Zastrow mystery? What interest save the merest\ncuriosity could he have in the matter? And yet he was by no means the\nsort of man to be merely curious. The very strangeness of his\nproposition half-convinced him that there must be some other very strong\nreason underlying those which he had given. Again, he was to be\nperfectly trusted, so no harm could be done trying to discover if this\nwas so, since if he could help he would do so loyally. So he told him.\n\n\"Yes, Professor,\" he said, looking keenly into his eyes, \"I am\ninterested in the _affaire_, professionally interested, and, I may add,\nvery deeply interested, to boot.\"\n\n\"I am glad to hear that,\" said Franklin Marmion with unexpected\nearnestness. \"Now, the next question is: Will you accept my assistance,\nwhatever it may be, under my own conditions, which are these: No one but\nyourself shall know that I am helping you, and you yourself will not ask\nme how I help you.\"\n\nOnce more a puzzle. Nicol Hendry thought for a few seconds before he\nreplied slowly:\n\n\"Yes, Professor. As long as you do help us I don't care either why or\nhow, for, as I may now be quite frank with you, we certainly want help\nof some sort very badly. The papers are quite right for once. Neither\nhere nor on the Continent have we found a single clue worth picking up.\nIt is humiliating, but it is true.\"\n\n\"Then before you go I hope I shall be able to give you some that will be\nworth picking up, and keeping too,\" said the scientist with a faint\nsmile; \"at any rate, I think I can put you upon certain lines of enquiry\nwhich you will find it profitable to trace out.\"\n\nNicol Hendry was an ambitious man, and he would have given a good deal\nto have known what was passing in the other's mind just then, but his\nexpression betrayed nothing more than interested anticipation.\n\n\"We shall be entirely grateful to you if you will, Professor,\" he\nmurmured.\n\n\"I have no doubt of that, my dear sir. Now, to begin with: I presume\nthat there are photographs of the persons mentioned in the newspapers\nas being in the Castle of Trelitz with the Prince on the last day that\nhe was known to be there?\"\n\n\"Certainly; we should scarcely leave a simple preliminary like that\nneglected,\" smiled Nicol Hendry. \"With the exception of the Fra\u00fclein\nHulda von Tyssen, the Princess' Lady of the Bedchamber, all have been\nphotographed for publication, and hers we have got through a private\nsource. The Chief of each of our Departments has a copy of them, and I\nhappen to have mine in my pocket now, if you would like to see them. The\nPrincess, of course, you must have seen. She is in every photographer's\nwindow in the West End.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I have seen her. Who has not? She is a singularly beautiful\nwoman. But I should very much like to see the others, if I may.\"\n\nThe Chef de Bureau looked at him sharply as he took a small square\nmorocco case out of his inner pocket and opened it. Going to a little\ntable he spread out five small unmounted photographs upon it. He put two\nof them on one side, saying:\n\n\"Those, of course, you know; they are the Prince and Princess. This one\nis Count Ulik von Kessner, High Chamberlain of Boravia; this, Captain\nAlexis Vollmar; and this is Fra\u00fclein von Tyssen.\"\n\nFranklin Marmion looked at them with much more than ordinary interest,\nfor he recognised all five as clearly as though he had just left them in\nhis own dining-room.\n\n\"There are no suspicions attaching to any of these people, I suppose?\"\nhe said carelessly.\n\n\"My dear Professor,\" replied Nicol Hendry a little coldly, \"those who\nwrite stories about our profession always say that it is our invariable\nrule to suspect everybody, but we have a little common-sense, and we\nknow the records of these ladies and gentlemen in the minutest detail\nfrom the Prince himself to Fra\u00fclein Hulda. We have not the slightest\nreason to suspect any of them.\"\n\n\"Ah, just so,\" said the other musingly; \"no, of course you wouldn't\nhave, and, unfortunately, I cannot tell you why you should. But I'll\ntell you this: if you ever do find cause to suspect any of these\npersons, you will find that this group is not complete. It ought to\ncontain the photograph of Prince Oscar Oscarovitch.\"\n\n\"Prince Oscar Oscarovitch!\" exclaimed Nicol Hendry, staring at him this\ntime with wide-open eyes. \"Why on earth should you----\"\n\n\"Pardon me, my dear sir,\" interrupted Franklin Marmion gently, \"remember\nthat you are not supposed to care anything about the why or the how. I\nhave already explained that I cannot explain.\"\n\n\"A thousand pardons, Professor. I don't often forget myself, but I did\nthen. You took me so utterly by surprise.\"\n\n\"I fancy that you will be a good deal more surprised before you have\ncome to the end of this affair,\" was the smiling but almost exasperating\nreply; \"but, as I implied, I can only give you clues. I cannot even\ntell you how I get them, and it is for you to follow them or not as your\njudgment dictates. Now, here are one or two to go on with. Try and find\nout whether or not there was a four-funnelled Russian destroyer anywhere\nin the neighbourhood of Trelitz on the night of the 6th. Trace as\nclosely as you can the movements of Prince Oscarovitch on that and the\ntwo preceding days. Try and find out whether or not a large closed\nchariot something like a barouche, drawn by four black horses, went from\nanywhere in the direction of the Castle on that day. And lastly, keep a\nvery close eye upon the Egyptian Adept, as he calls himself--his name is\nPhadrig Amena--who worked those alleged miracles at my daughter's\ngarden-party the other day. The Prince practically invited himself, and\nbrought this fellow with him. If you can find out the true relationship\nbetween them I think you will have found out enough to keep you rather\nbusy for the present. If you do think anything of these little points\nand examine them, let me know how you get on. We are going abroad for a\nbit of a holiday, but I will send you my address every now and then.\nNow, let us go back into the drawing-room, and my daughter will give us\nsome tea.\"\n\nWhen Nicol Hendry left \"The Wilderness\" that afternoon he was about the\nmost mystified man in London. After he had gone, Franklin Marmion said\nto Nitocris:\n\n\"Well, Niti, what do you think of our gimlet-eyed friend? Will he do?\"\n\n\"Yes, Dad; I like his manner, and he seems very clever in his own way.\nQuite a gentleman, too,\" she replied.\n\n\"I'm glad you think that,\" he added; \"but what a pity it is that we\ncould not get the world to accept fourth dimensional evidence without\nturning the said world inside out. We could clear up the whole _affaire_\nZastrow in a week then.\"\n\n\"But we shouldn't enjoy our holiday as much, I'm afraid, it would be too\nexciting,\" concluded Nitocris.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nMURDER BY SUGGESTION\n\n\nTwo days later the Marmions left London for Copenhagen, whence they\nintended to take a trip among the Baltic Islands, now looking their\nbrightest and prettiest, then up along the Norwegian Fiords, just before\nthe tourist rush began, and finally across from Trondjem to Iceland.\nThey were both excellent sailors, and both disliked crowds, especially\nwhen the said crowds were pleasure-hunting. Moreover, they had now a\nparticular reason for being alone that they might enjoy together--they,\nthe only two mortals who could do so--the countless marvels of that new\nexistence which had now become possible for them. Where, too, could they\ndo this to more advantage than in the ancient Northland, whose\nmarvellous past would now be to them even as the present of their own\ntemporal lives?\n\nThe Van Huysmans, and, of course, Lord Lester Leighton, were to remain\nin London until the end of the Season. Uncle Ephraim had cabled warm\ncongratulations and large credits, and so Brenda, very naturally as a\nnewly-engaged girl and a prospective Countess, wanted all that London\nand Ranelagh and Henley, Ascot and Goodwood and Cowes, could give her\nbefore her devoted lover's yacht carried them off to the Mediterranean.\nLater in the autumn they were all to go over to the States to spend the\nwinter in Washington and New York, whence they were to return to London\nfor the wedding in May: surely as pleasant a programme--I fear that Miss\nBrenda spelt it \"program\"--as could be desired even by a fair maiden\nupon whom the kindly Fates had already showered their choicest gifts.\nThe only bitter drop in the family cup of content was the fact that\nProfessor van Huysman was as far away as ever from the exposure of the\nfallacy which, as he was immovably convinced, those abominable\ndemonstrations _must_ contain.\n\nAfter due consultation between Nicol Hendry and his colleagues of\nFrance, Germany, and Russia, it was decided to follow up the clues which\nhe had so mysteriously received. The others would, of course, have been\nvery glad to know where and how he got them, but at the outset he had\nput them on their honour not to ask, and so professional etiquette made\nit impossible for them to do anything but accept his assurance that he\nhad received them from a source which was quite beyond reproach. Once\nthey accepted the situation, they got to work with a quiet thoroughness\nwhich resulted in the spreading of an invisible but unbreakable net\nround the footsteps of every one of the suspects from the great\nOscarovitch himself to the humble seller of curios in Candler's Court,\nand his still humbler friends Pent-Ah and Neb-Anat, who were known to\nthe few who knew them as Mr and Mrs Pentana, renovators, and, possibly\nmanufacturers, of ancient gems and relics.\n\nBut to one pair of eyes, at least, the police-net was as plainly visible\nas a spider's web hanging in the sunlight.\n\nWithin three days Phadrig received a visit from a shabbily-dressed but\nwell-to-do Jew trader with whom he had done business before, who wanted\nto know if he could put him in the way of getting some really good old\nEgyptian gems and jewellery to show on approval to a wealthy patron who\nwanted to give his daughter a set of rare and uncommon ornaments on her\nwedding day. It was by this means, by acting as an intermediary between\nthose who had something to sell and those who wished to buy, that\nPhadrig was supposed to make his modest living. His knowledge of Eastern\nantiquities was admittedly great, though, of course, no one knew how\ngreat, and he had often been asked why, instead of living in such a\nwretched way, he did not start a little business for himself; to which\nhe always replied that he had no capital, and that he preferred\nindependence, however poor, to the cares and ties of regular trading.\n\nWhen the Jew had stated his business, Phadrig looked at him with sleepy\neyes with a strange expression in them which, for some reason or other,\nheld his visitor's usually shifty gaze fixed, and said in a slow, gentle\nvoice:\n\n\"It is very kind of you, Mr Josephus, to bring me all these nice little\ncommissions. They are of much benefit to a poor student of antiquities\nlike myself, although I do not like trading in things that I love.\nStill, one must live if one would study. Now, I had a gem sent to me the\nother day which I would dearly love to possess, but, alas! as well might\nI long for the Koh-i-Noor itself. Moreover, it is already promised--nay,\nas good as sold. But what have the poor to do with such splendours save\nto help the rich to buy them!\"\n\nThe Jew's prominent eyes shone with an inward light at the mention of\nthe gem, and he said in a coaxing voice:\n\n\"My dear Phadrig, we have always been friends for ever so long, and you\nsay I've been a good customer to you. Might I have a look at that gem?\nYou know how fond I am of the pretty things. Have you got it here?\"\n\n\"Yes, and you shall see it with pleasure, my good Josephus,\" replied\nPhadrig, well knowing the thought that was in his mind when he asked if\nhe had the gem there in that shabby, unprotected room.\n\nHe went to the old oak secretaire, unlocked a cupboard at the side, and\nthen a drawer within it, followed in every motion by the gleaming eyes\nof the Jew, and took from it a leather parcel. He undid this and\nproduced a box, about four inches long and three wide, of plain black\npolished wood. It looked solid, but Phadrig made a swift motion with his\nfingers, and one half of it slid off the other. He held it towards his\nvisitor, and said:\n\n\"What do you think of that as a specimen of ancient art, Mr Josephus?\"\n\nThe Jew looked. The inside of the box seemed filled with green light\ntinted with yellow. Out of the midst of it began to shine a deeper green\nlight which crystallised into the most glorious emerald that he had ever\neven dreamt of. It was fully an inch square, flawless, and of perfect\ncolour. The yellow sheen came from a framework of heavy,\nexquisitely-wrought gold. Phadrig took it out and held it before him,\nand the green light seemed to radiate through the dull atmosphere of the\nroom. The Jew stared at it with bulging eyes and trembling under-lip,\nand his hands went out towards it with a gesture which seemed like\nworship.\n\n\"God of Israel,\" he gasped, \"was anything so splendid ever seen before!\nMr Phadrig, is it--is it real?\"\n\n\"Real?\" echoed the Egyptian scornfully. \"Did you ever see light like\nthat come out of a sham stone? You should know more about gems than\nthat, Mr Josephus.\"\n\n\"Ah yes, yes, of course. It is glorious; it is worthy to shine on the\nbreastplate of the High Priest--and what a price it must be! Is it\nallowed to ask the name of the great millionaire for whom it is\ndestined?\"\n\n\"Yes. It will in a few hours be the property of Prince Oscar\nOscarovitch.\"\n\nAs Phadrig spoke he hid the gem in his hand. His voice was so changed\nthat the Jew looked up at him. His eyes were wide open now, and glowing\nwith a fire that made them look almost dull red. They seemed to see\nright through his eyeballs and look into his brain. Josephus started as\nthough he had been struck. He tried to turn his head away, but the\nterrible eyes held him. His fat, greasy, olive face grew grey and dry,\nand his head shook from side to side.\n\n\"What is the matter, my dear Mr Josephus?\" asked Phadrig, in slow, stern\ntones. \"The mention of the Prince seems to have affected your nerves.\nAre you acquainted with His Highness?\"\n\n\"Me? I? Why, how should I know a great man like the noble Prince? No,\nno; of course I know him as a very grand and great gentleman, but that\nis all, really all, my dear Phadrig.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, of course,\" said the Egyptian, once more in his gentle voice;\n\"would not be likely, would it? Now, if you would like to look at the\ngem more closely, go and sit down there by the light and take it in your\nhand. You will see that it is engraved with hieroglyphics. They say that\nthis jewel was once the property of Rameses the Great of Egypt, and was\ngiven by him to his daughter Nitocris.\"\n\nThis information did not interest the Jew in the slightest, since he had\nnever heard the names in his life; but the delight and honour of holding\nsuch a glorious gem in his hand even for a few minutes was ecstasy to\nhim. He sat down, and held out his fat, trembling hand greedily. With a\nsmile of contempt Phadrig placed the jewel in it, and said:\n\n\"Examine it closely, my friend. It is well worth it, and it may be long\nbefore you see another like it.\"\n\n\"Like--like _it_, like _this_! By the beard of Father\nMoses, I should think not--I should think--I should--oh,\nbeautiful--glor--glorious--splendid--did--splen--oh, what a\nlight--li--light--li--oh----!\"\n\nAs each of the disjointed syllables came from his shaking lips he\nmumbled more and more, and his head sank lower towards the priceless\nthing in his palm. As he gazed, the stone grew round and bigger and\nbrighter, till it seemed like a great green-blazing eye glaring into the\nutmost depths of his being. Then the light suddenly went out, his head\nfell on his breast, and as his hand sank, Phadrig caught it and took\naway the jewel. Then he put the Jew back in the chair, and standing in\nfront of him began in a slow, penetrating voice:\n\n\"Isaac Josephus, thou hast gazed upon the Horus Stone, and he who doeth\nthat may not answer the questions of an Adept with lies save at the\nprice of his life. Now answer me truly, or to-morrow morning those of\nthine household shall find thee dead in thy bed.\"\n\nWide open the eyes of the hypnotised man stared at him, and the loose\nlips quivered, but these were the only signs of life.\n\n\"Thou art not only a dealer in gems and curious things: thou art also a\nspy of the police; is not that so?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Believing that I am a very poor man, yet knowing that I dealt with\nobjects of value, they thought me to be one who receives such things\nfrom thieves to sell them again, since they could not. Is that so?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And, believing this, and knowing thee to have dealings with me, they\nbribed thee to come here as my friend and fellow-dealer and spy upon my\nactions, so that they might have evidence against me and cast me into\nprison. Is that so?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Late on the last night but one thou didst go to the house of Nicol\nHendry, who is no common catcher of thieves, but a spy of nations whose\nbusiness is with the great ones of the earth. Tell me: whom did thy\nbusiness with him concern?\"\n\n\"Prince Oscarovitch and yourself.\"\n\n\"What were his orders?\"\n\n\"To watch you both, especially you, and find out when you went to him,\nand why you were sometimes a poor devil in a miserable hole like this,\nand sometimes a swell going to swagger places with him.\"\n\n\"How were you going to do this?\"\n\n\"I know your servant or chum, Mr Pentana. I've lent him money: and Peter\nPetroff, the Prince's particular servant, gambles like a lord, and he\nowes me and a friend of mine a lot of money. We were going to work\nthrough them.\"\n\n\"It is enough; and well for you that you have answered truthfully. Now\ntell me: do you know how to use a revolver?\"\n\n\"Never fired a shot in my life.\"\n\nPhadrig went to the secretaire and took a common, cheap revolver,\nidentical with thousands of others which our criminally careless\nGovernment allows to be bought every day without the production of a\nlicence--just a hooligan's weapon, in fact--went back and put it into\nthe Jew's hand. He raised the hand several times, and pointed the muzzle\nto the temple, keeping the forefinger on the trigger. At length he let\ngo the wrist, and said in a gentle, persuading tone:\n\n\"That is the way to handle a revolver when you are going to shoot, my\ndear Josephus. Now, let me see if you can do it by yourself.\"\n\nWith mechanical precision the Jew's arm went up until the muzzle touched\nhis temple. Again and again he did the same thing at Phadrig's bidding,\ntill at length he said rather more peremptorily:\n\n\"Now pull the trigger!\"\n\nThe finger tightened and the hammer clicked. Five times more was the\noperation repeated, and then Phadrig gently took the revolver and laid\nthe hand down. He went to the secretaire and loaded the six chambers,\ncocked the weapon and put it into the right hand side-pocket of the\nlounge jacket which Josephus was wearing, and said deliberately:\n\n\"Now remember, my dear Josephus: you will go straight back to your\noffice in Waterloo Road and let yourself in with your key. In your\nprivate room you will see a man who wants to rob you of some valuable\npapers. You will be ruined if he gets them, so you must take your pistol\nout of your pocket and shoot him. Do you quite understand me?\"\n\n\"Yes; I am to shoot him.\"\n\n\"That is right. Now, if you do not go he will have them before you get\nthere. Get up and we will say good-night. You must not put your hand in\nyour pocket until you see the man who wants to rob you. Good-night.\nThere is your hat.\"\n\n\"Good-night!\"\n\nMr Isaac Josephus put on his hat and walked away to his death with the\nmotions of a mechanical doll.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nTHE HORUS STONE\n\n\nAn hour later Phadrig, the poor curio dealer, had disappeared, and Mr\nPhadrig Amena, the wonder-working Adept, clad in evening clothes and a\nlight overcoat, alighted from a hansom at the great entrance to the\nRoyal Court Mansions. The huge, gorgeously uniformed guardian of the\nGilded Gates was saluting at his elbow in an instant, for a friend of\nPrinces is a very great man in the eyes of even such dignitaries as he.\n\n\"The Prince expects you, sir,\" he said, loud enough to make the title\nheard by those who were standing by. \"Will you be good enough to walk\nin? I will discharge the cab.\"\n\nHe stood aside with a bow and another salute, and Phadrig walked lightly\nup the broad steps. Peter Petroff opened the door of the flat, bowing\nlow, and conducted him to his master's sanctum. Evidently he was\nexpected, for the coffee apparatus stood ready on the Moorish table\nbeside the cosy chair which he was wont to occupy. The Prince, who was\nstanding on a white bear's skin by the mantel, motioned him to it,\nsaying:\n\n\"Ah, Phadrig, my friend, punctual, of course; and equally, of course,\nyou have something important to impart. Your wire just caught me in\ntime to put off an engagement which, happily, is of no great\nconsequence. There's the coffee, and you'll find the cigars you like in\nthe second drawer. Now, what is the news?\"\n\nHis guest filled a cup of coffee and took a cigar and lit it before he\nreplied. Then, turning to the Prince, he said in his usual slow, even\ntone:\n\n\"Highness, I regret to say that my news is both urgent and bad.\"\n\n\"It would naturally be urgent,\" said the Prince, turning quickly towards\nhim, \"but bad I hardly expected. Well, all news cannot be good. What is\nit?\"\n\n\"I fear that my warning was even more urgent than I thought it myself--I\nmean, in point of time. Your Highness is already being watched.\"\n\n\"What! A Prince of the Empire, the man whom they call the Modern\nSkobeleff, an intimate of Nicholas! What should I be watched for?\"\nexclaimed the Prince, half angry and half astonished. \"The thing is\nridiculous; another of your dreams!\"\n\n\"Ridiculous it may be, Highness,\" replied Phadrig, quite unruffled, \"but\nit is no dream; and, moreover, the eyes which are watching you are keen\nones--and they are everywhere. You are under the surveillance of the\nInternational Police.\"\n\nThese were not words which even a Prince of the Holy Russian Empire\ncared to hear. Oscarovitch was silent for a few moments, for the\nearnestness, and yet the calmness, with which they were spoken made it\nimpossible for him to doubt them. As he had asked, what could such a man\nas he be watched for by this thousand-eyed organisation of which he\nhimself was one of the supreme Directors? It was impossible that\nthese people could suspect his great scheme of treachery and\nself-aggrandisement. That was known to only three persons in the\nworld--himself, Phadrig, and the Princess Hermia; and the Princess, the\nwoman who had willingly sacrificed her brilliant young husband to her\nguilty love and her boundless ambition--no, she could be no traitress.\nIt must be something else: and yet what?\n\nHe took two or three rapid turns up and down the room, chewing and\npuffing at his cigar, until he stopped before Phadrig, and said quietly,\nbut with angry eyes:\n\n\"Very well, we will grant that I am watched by the International. Tell\nme how you came to know it.\"\n\nThe Egyptian took a few sips of his coffee, and then related almost word\nfor word his interview with Josephus. He ended by saying:\n\n\"Your Highness may believe or not now as you please, but I presume you\nwill when you read in your paper to-morrow morning of the suicide of a\nrespectable Hebrew merchant named Isaac Josephus at the address which I\nhave mentioned.\"\n\nOscarovitch had pretty strong nerves, and he was well accustomed to\nregard any kind of crime as a quite proper means of furthering\npolitical ends: but there was something in this man's utter\nsoullessness and the weird horror of the crime which he had just\naccomplished--for by this time his victim would be already lying\nself-slain on the floor of his own spider's lair--that chilled him,\ncold-blooded as he was. He looked at him lounging in his chair and\ncalmly puffing the smoke from his half-smiling lips as though he hadn't\na thought beyond the little blue rings that he was making.\n\n\"That was a devilish thing to do, Phadrig!\" he said, a little above a\nwhisper.\n\n\"Devilish, possibly, Highness, but necessary, of a certainty,\" was the\nquiet reply. \"You will agree with me that Nicol Hendry is a dangerous\nantagonist even for you, and as for me--no doubt he thinks that he can\ncrush me under his foot whenever he chooses to put it down. I should\nlike to know his feelings as he reads of his spy's suicide when he had\nonly just got to work.\"\n\n\"It will certainly be somewhat of a shock to him and his colleagues, and\nfor that reason I am inclined, on second thoughts, to agree that it was\nnecessary, and ghastly, as I confess; it seems to me, I think, that you\ntook the best means to give them a salutary warning. After all, the life\nof an individual, and that individual a Jew, does not count for much\nwhen the fate of empires is at stake. What puzzles me is how these\nfellows came to suspect me, and what do they suspect me of. I suppose\nyou have no idea on the subject, have you?\"\n\nHe looked at him keenly as he spoke, but he might as well have looked at\nthe face of a graven image. Then, like a flash of inspiration, the\nZastrow affair leapt into his mind. Had his connection with that, by any\nextraordinary chance, come to the knowledge of the International? The\nthought was distinctly disquieting. Phadrig had helped in this with his\nstrange arts. He would discuss this phase of the matter with him\nafterwards.\n\nPhadrig replied, returning his glance:\n\n\"Highness, I have only one explanation to offer, and that you have\nalready refused. Were I to speak of any other it would only be vain\ninvention.\"\n\n\"You mean about Professor Marmion and his mathematical miracles?\" said\nthe Prince somewhat uneasily.\n\n\"I do,\" replied the Egyptian firmly. \"I say now what I thought when I\nsaw him work them. I did not believe that any man could have done what\nhe did unless he had attained to what we styled in the ancient days the\nPerfect Knowledge, or, as they term it to-day, passed the border between\nthe states of three and four dimensions. If Professor Marmion has\nachieved that triumph of virtue and intelligence--and in the days that I\ncan remember there were more than one of the adepts who had done\nso--then Your Highness's Imperial designs must be as well known to him\nas to yourself: nay, better, for, while you can see only a part, the\nbeginning and a little way beyond, he can see the whole, even to the\nend; for in that state, as we were taught, past, present, and future are\none. Now, only three persons know of the project, and treason among them\nis not within the limits of reason, wherefore I would again ask Your\nHighness to believe that such information as the International may have\nhas been given them directly or indirectly by Professor Marmion.\"\n\n\"But,\" said the Prince, who was now evidently wavering in his\nscepticism, since Phadrig's explanation of the mystery really seemed to\nbe the only feasible one, impossible as it looked to him, \"granted all\nyou say, what possible interest could Professor Marmion, whether he's\nliving in this world or the one of four dimensions, have in interfering\nin such a project, even if he did know all about it, especially as every\neducated Englishman admits that the state of affairs in Russia could\nhardly be worse than it is? I cannot see what conceivable interest he\ncan have in the matter.\"\n\n\"But, Highness, his interest may be a private and not a public one.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that, Phadrig?\" asked the Prince sharply.\n\n\"As I have said,\" replied the Egyptian slowly, \"it may be that his\ndaughter, who was once the Queen, has also attained to the Knowledge. In\nthat case the love which Your Highness so suddenly conceived for her\nwould instantly bring you within the sphere of his and her influence and\npower. Now, she, as Nitocris Marmion, the mortal, is betrothed to the\nEnglish officer, Merrill. She loves him, and therefore, since you are\ngreat and powerful in the earth-life, your ruin, or even your death,\nmight seem necessary to remove you from her path.\"\n\nOscarovitch shivered in spite of all his courage and self-control. The\nidea of fearing anything human had never occurred to him after his first\nbattle; but this, if true, was a very different matter. To be threatened\nwith ruin or death by a power which he could not even see, to contend\nagainst enemies who could read his very thoughts, and even be present in\na room with him without his knowing it--as Phadrig had assured him more\nthan once that they could be--was totally beyond the power of the\nbravest or strongest of men. No, it was impossible: he could not, would\nnot, believe that, such a thing could be. His invincible materialism\ncame suddenly to his aid, and saved him from the reproach of fear in his\nown eyes.\n\n\"No, Phadrig,\" he said, with a gesture of impatience, \"that is not to be\ncredited. To you it may seem a reality: to me it can never be anything\nmore than a phantasy of intellect run mad on a single point--which, I\nneed hardly remind you, is a by no means uncommon failing of the\ngreatest of minds. Another reason has just occurred to me which would\nneed no such fantastic explanation.\"\n\n\"And that, Highness?\" queried Phadrig, looking up with an almost\nimperceptible shrug of his shoulders.\n\n\"The Zastrow affair. Unlikely as it seems, it is not impossible that\nthere has been treason there. I have many enemies in both Russia and\nGermany, and it is well known that Zastrow and I were rivals once. Yes,\nthat is it: it must be so, and therefore we must prepare to fight the\nInternational; and with such weapons as you are able to use there is not\nmuch reason why we should fear them.\"\n\nHe dismissed the subject with an imperious wave of his hand, and\ncontinued in an altered tone:\n\n\"And now, _\u00e0propos_ of your weapons. Tell me something about this\nwonderful gem with which you hypnotised the Jew.\"\n\n\"I will not only tell you about it, Highness, I will show it to you, if\nyou desire to see it,\" replied Phadrig, who now fully recognised the\nhopelessness of overcoming the blind materialism which was, of course,\ninevitable to the life-condition in which the Prince had his present\nbeing.\n\n\"What! you have brought it with you! Excellent! Now I think we shall be\nable to talk on pleasanter subjects than conspiracies and such phantasms\nas the Fourth Dimension!\" exclaimed Oscarovitch, who, like all Russians,\nwas almost passionately fond of gems. \"Fancy asking a Russian if he\ndesires to see such a thing as that!\"\n\n\"Your Excellency must be careful not to look at it too long or closely,\"\nsaid Phadrig, putting his hand down inside his waistcoat and drawing out\na wash-leather bag. \"As I have told you, it possesses certain qualities\nwhich are not to be trifled with. You are, of course, aware that many\nEastern gems are credited with hypnotic powers. This one undoubtedly has\nthem.\"\n\nAs he spoke he drew out the emerald, and held it by the clasp under a\ncluster of electric lights.\n\n\"What a glorious gem!\" exclaimed the Prince, starting forward to look at\nit more closely. \"There is nothing to compare with it even among the\nImperial jewels of Russia.\"\n\n\"Have a care, Highness,\" said the Egyptian, raising his left hand,\n\"unless you wish to fall under its influence. Once it seized your gaze\nyou could not withdraw it without the permission of its possessor, and\nmeanwhile he would have complete mastery of you. I am your faithful\nservant, and therefore I warn you.\"\n\nWas there just the faintest suspicion of a sneer in his voice as he said\nthis? If there was, Oscarovitch did not notice it. He was already too\nmuch under the charm of the Horus Stone. Phadrig suddenly put his hand\nover the gem and went on. \"The story of this jewel, Highness, is that\nmany ages ago, before the beginning of the First Dynasty, a little raft\nof a strange wood, as white as ivory and shaped like a river-lily, came\nfloating down the Nile at full flood-time and drifted to the shore in\nfront of the house of a wise and holy man who was reputed to hold\nperpetual communion with the gods. On the raft was a cradle of white\nwicker-work lined with down, upon which lay a man-child of such\nexquisite beauty that he could scarce have been born of mortal parents.\nHis body was bare, but round his neck was a glistening chain of\nmarvellously wrought gold, fastened to which was this gem lying on his\nbreast. This was doubtless the origin of the Hebrew fable of the finding\nof Moses, who, as all scholars know, was not a Hebrew, but an Egyptian\npriest in the House of Ra.\n\n\"The holy man took him into his home, burying the chain and gem, lest it\nmight bring temptation to those who saw them; and as the boy grew to\nmanhood he taught him all his lore, until he, too, was wise enough to be\nadmitted into the communion of the gods, which afterwards was called by\nthe adepts the Perfect Knowledge. On the gem are engraved the three\nsymbols by which the Trinity--Osiris, Isis, and Horus; Father: Mother,\nand Child, the antetype of Humanity--became known and worshipped. The\nholy man divined that the boy was the incarnation of Horus sent thus to\nearth to teach men the way of knowledge, which is the only\nrighteousness, since those who know all cannot sin. Where his house\nstood was built the first Temple of the Divine Trinity, and of this\nHorus became High Priest. He crowned the King in the land, and hung this\ngem round his neck as the symbol of his kingship and the approval of the\ngods.\n\n\"From the first king it was handed down from monarch to monarch through\nall the changes of dynasties, until it hung from the royal chain of the\ngreat Rameses; and by him it was given to his daughter Nitocris, thereby\nmaking her Queen of Egypt after him; and she wore it on that fatal\nnight of the death-bridal when, rather than wed with you, who were then\nMenkau-Ra, Lord of War, she flooded the banqueting hall of Pepi and\ndrowned herself and all her guests--which, Highness, is an omen that it\nwere well for you not to forget should you persist in your pursuit of\nthe daughter of Professor Marmion.\"\n\nOscarovitch was a man of vivid imagination, as all great soldiers and\nstatesmen must be, and so the story of the Horus Stone appealed strongly\nto him; but what interested him perhaps even more was the spectacle of\nthis man, who had just been guilty of a peculiarly ghastly form of\nmurder, sitting there and telling with simple eloquence and evident\nreverence the sacred Myth out of which what was perhaps the most ancient\nreligion in the world had evolved. He heard him with a silence of both\ninterest and respect until his last sentence. Then he got up and\nstretched his arms out and said with a laugh:\n\n\"Omen, Phadrig! Your tale of the stone has interested me deeply, but I\nbelieve no more in the omen than I do in the story. Ay, and even if I\ndid, I would dare all the omens that wizards ever invented for their own\nprofit in trying to make Nitocris Marmion what I want her to be, and\nwhat she shall be unless she is the cause of my first failure to achieve\nwhat I had set my heart upon. But you have not finished your story. Tell\nme now how the stone came into your possession, seeing that it was swept\nout into the Nile hanging on the breast of the Royal Nitocris.\"\n\n\"The next season of Flood, so the records ran, Highness, the skeleton of\na woman was washed up to the foot of the river stairs of the House of\nPtah, and the stone and chain were found among the weeds which filled\nthe cavity of the chest. They were taken with all reverence to the High\nPriest, who bore them to the Pharaoh, and, amidst great rejoicing, hung\nthem round his neck. Then from Pharaoh to Pharaoh it came down through\nthe centuries until it fell into the possession of her who wrought the\nruin of the Ancient Land. She gave the stone to her lover, and from his\nbody it was taken by a priest of the Ancient Faith who once was\nAnemen-Ha, and is now Phadrig Amena, the degenerate worker of mean\nmarvels which the ignorant of these days would call miracles did they\nnot take them for conjuring tricks.\n\n\"Since then it remained hidden, seen only by the successors of him who\nrescued it from the plunderers of the body of Antony, until, seemingly\nin the way of trade, yet doubtless for some deep reason which is not\nrevealed to me, it came back into my hands again. Such so far, Highness,\nis the end of the story of the Stone of Horus.\"\n\n\"And doubtless more yet remains to be written or told,\" said the Prince\nseriously, for he was really impressed in spite of his scepticism. Then,\nafter a little pause, he continued: \"Phadrig, you have said that the\nstone is dangerous to any but its possessor. I wish to possess it. Name\nyour price, and, to half my fortune, you shall have it.\"\n\n\"The stone, Highness,\" replied the Egyptian, with the shadow of a smile\nflickering across his lips, \"never has been, and never can be, sold for\nmoney, so I could not sell it, even if money had value for me, which it\nhas not. There is only one price for it.\"\n\n\"And what is that?\"\n\n\"A human life--perchance many lives--but all to be paid in succession by\nhim or her who buys it, unless he or she shall attain to the Perfect\nKnowledge.\"\n\n\"Give it to me, then!\" exclaimed Oscarovitch, holding out his hand. \"The\nlife I have I will gladly pay for it in the hope of laying it on the\nbreast of the living Nitocris. As I do not believe in any others, I will\nthrow them in. Give it to me!\"\n\n\"It is a perilous possession, Highness, for one who has not even\nattained to the Greater Knowledge, as I have. Let me warn you to think\nagain, for once you take it from me the price must be paid to the\nuttermost pang of the doom that it may bring with it.\"\n\n\"I care nothing about your knowledges, Phadrig,\" laughed the Prince,\nstill holding out his hand. \"It is enough for me to know that it is the\nmost glorious gem on earth, and that it shall help me to win the\ndivinest woman on earth. So, once more, give it to me!\"\n\n\"Take it, then, Highness,\" said the Egyptian, with a ring of solemnity\nin his voice. \"Take, and with it all that the High Gods may have in\nstore for you!\"\n\nHe dropped the more than priceless gem into his hand with as little\nreluctance as he would have given him a brass trinket. Then he turned\naway to take another cigar, leaving Oscarovitch gazing in silent ecstasy\nat, as he thought, his easily-come-by treasure. Then the Prince went to\na large panel picture fixed to the wall on the left-hand side of the\nfireplace, touched it with his finger, and it swung aside, disclosing\nthe door of a small safe built into the wall. He unlocked this, placed\nthe stone in an inner drawer, closed the safe, and put the picture back\nin its place.\n\nWhen he sat down again, he said:\n\n\"My good friend, I know that it is useless for me to thank you, for even\nif you wanted thanks I could not do justice to the occasion, as they say\nin speeches: but I want to ask you just one more question, and then I\nwon't keep you any longer from that delightful Oriental Club of yours\nwhich I suppose you are bound to. Now that I have got the stone I am, as\nyou may well believe, more than anxious to find the lady to whom it\nshall belong--again, as I suppose you would say. To my great disgust,\nthe Professor and his daughter have disappeared from the sphere of\nLondon society for a holiday _\u00e0 deux_, and have, apparently with intent,\nleft all their friends in ignorance of their destination. Have you any\nidea of it? I know that that Coptic woman whom you employ has been\nordered to keep a sharp watch on the movements of Miss Nitocris.\"\n\n\"Yes, Highness,\" replied Phadrig, \"and she has obeyed her orders. The\nday before they left she waylaid that pretty maid of Miss Marmion's on\nthe Common, and told her fortune. Of course, she talked the usual jargon\nabout lovers and letters and going on a journey, and the maid quite\ninnocently let out that she was going with her master and mistress by\nsteamer to Denmark and up the coast of Norway, and then over to Iceland\nby the passenger steamers, and that she did not like the idea at all,\nbecause she knew that she would be very seasick.\"\n\n\"Excellent! the very thing!\" exclaimed the Prince. \"It couldn't be\nbetter if I had arranged it myself. My yacht is down in the Solent\nwaiting for Cowes Week. I'll be afloat to-morrow. Give that woman a\nten-pound note from me with my blessing. Now, I shall leave everything\nelse to you. Do what you think fit with regard to our friends of the\nInternational. Kill as many of their spies as you can with safety, and\nmake the chiefs believe that they are fighting the Devil himself. And\nnow, good-night.\"\n\nWhen Peter Petroff brought him the papers the next morning, the Prince\ntook up the _Telegraph_, and turned to the page devoted to the minor\nevents of the previous day. His eye was almost immediately caught by a\nparagraph headed:\n\n     \"SUICIDE IN THE WATERLOO ROAD\n\n     \"Shortly after seven last evening the passers-by on the eastern\n     side of this thoroughfare were startled by hearing the report of a\n     firearm, apparently coming from the office of Mr Isaac Josephus at\n     138a. Constable 206 Q., who was on point-duty near the spot, had\n     seen Mr Josephus enter the office with his key only a few minutes\n     before, walking in a rather curious way, and staring straight\n     before him. As the door was locked, the officer thought it his duty\n     to force it. The door of the inner office was also locked, and when\n     this was opened, the unfortunate man was found lying across the\n     desk with a bullet wound in his temple. His right hand still\n     clutched a cheap revolver which was loaded in five chambers. There\n     appears at present to have been no reason for the rash act. Mr\n     Josephus was a broker dealing chiefly in curios and antique\n     jewellery. Although not in a large way of business, his affairs are\n     understood to have been in a prosperous condition. What makes the\n     tragedy all the more strange is the fact that suicide is almost\n     unknown among persons of the Jewish faith.\"\n\nOscarovitch felt a little shiver run down his back as he read the\ncommonplace lines. The man who had done this had been in this room with\nhim a few hours before, and one of the means of murder was now in his\nsafe. It would have been just as easy for Phadrig to have caused him to\nlook upon the fatal gem, left a bottle of poison with him, and told him\nto take it as medicine on going to bed. The only difference would have\nbeen that there would have been a very much greater sensation in the\npapers.\n\nNicol Hendry was reading the paragraph about the same time. His eyes\ncontracted, and he stroked his beard with slow motions of his hand. The\nhand was steady, but even his nerves quivered a little. He divined\ninstantly how the suicide-murder had been brought about, and this very\nfact, coupled with the absolute impossibility of proving anything, made\nthe affair all the more disquieting.\n\n\"So that is the sort of thing we've got to fight, is it? I don't like\nit. Still, it goes far to prove that the Professor was perfectly right\nwhen he told me to keep a sharp eye on Mr Phadrig Amena.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nTHROUGH THE CENTURIES\n\n\nAs they discovered that the sea journey to Copenhagen would be somewhat\ntedious and uninteresting, and that the steamers were not exactly\npalatial, Nitocris and her father decided at the last minute to cross to\nOstend, spend a day there and go on to Cologne, put in a couple of days\nmore among its venerable and odorous purlieus, and two more at Hamburg,\nso that, while the present-day inhabitants were asleep, they might, as\nNitocris somewhat flippantly put it, take a trip back through the\ncenturies, and watch the great city grow from the little wooden village\nof the Ubii and the Roman colony of Agrippina into the Hanse Town of the\nthirteenth century: watch the laying of the first stone of the mighty\nDom, the up-rising of the glorious fabric, and the crowning of the last\ntower in 1880.\n\nDuring the journey from Hamburg to Copenhagen, Nitocris, reclining\ncomfortably in a corner of their compartment in the long, easily-moving\ncar, entertained herself with a review of these extraordinary\nexperiences from the point of view of her temporal life, and found them\nnot only extraordinary, but also very curious. She had already learnt\nthat the connecting link between the two existences, when once the\nborder had been passed, was Will: but Will of a far more intense and\nexalted character than that which was necessary as an incentive to\naction on the lower plane. There was naturally something that seemed\nextra-human in the mysterious force which was capable of bidding the\npresent-day world vanish like a shadow into either the future or the\npast, its solid-seeming substance melt away like \"the airy fabric of a\nvision,\" and summon in an instant, too brief to be measured, the past\nfrom the grave where it lay buried beneath the dust of uncounted ages,\nor the future from the womb of unborn things.\n\nBut to her, at least at first, the strangest part of the new revelation\nwas this: When her will had carried her across the confines of the\ntri-dimensional world, and she saw the centuries marshalled and\nmotionless before her, she felt not the slightest sense of wonder or\nawe. She was simply a being apart, moving along their ranks and passing\nthem in review, herself unseen and unknown save by that other being who,\nin this state, was no longer her father or even her friend, but merely a\ncompanion endowed with power and intelligence equal to her own. Her\nhuman hopes and fears and loves and passions had, as it were, been left\nbehind. The men and things she saw were absolutely real to her, as they\nhad been to the men of other days, or would be in days to come; but she\nherself was a pure Intelligence which saw and acted and thought with\nperfect clearness, but with absolutely no feeling save that of\nintellectual interest.\n\nShe saw armies meet in the shock of battle without a thrill of fear or\nhorror; towns and cities roared up to the unheeding heavens in flame and\nsmoke, and left her standing unmoved amidst their ruins; she heard the\nscreams of agony that rang through the torture chambers without a\nquiver, and watched the long, pale lines of the martyrs to what in the\nearth-life was called Religion pass to the stake without a quiver of\npity or a thrill of disgust. She stood face to face with the great ones\nof the earth who have graven their names deep upon the tablets of Time\nwithout reverence or admiration; and she witnessed the most heroic deeds\nand the most atrocious crimes with neither respect for the one nor\nhatred for the other.\n\nHuman history was in her eyes merely a logical sequence of necessary\nevents, neither good nor bad in themselves, but only as they were viewed\nfrom this standpoint or that, by the oppressor or the oppressed, the\nslayer or the slain, the robber or the robbed, the governor or the\ngoverned. She learned that human emotion is merely a matter of time and\nspace. One century does not feel the loves and hates of another, and the\nsorrows of Here have no real sympathy with the sufferings of There.\nBeyond the Border all these were merely matters of intense intellectual\ninterest.\n\nBut when she returned to the temporal life the memory of them was\nmarvellous and terrible. Her heart throbbed with pity and burned with\nrighteous anger. Horror seemed to take hold of her soul and shake it\nwith earthquake shudders when she thought that what she had seen but a\nfew time-moments ago had really come to pass; and she longed for the\npower to show all this to the men and women of her own passing day, and\nbid them have done with the poor, shadowy images of themselves, which,\nhad they really been gods, would have made of human life something\nbetter and happier and nobler than the ghastly tragedy which, as she had\nseen with her own eyes, it had been. But she knew that such a power was\nnot hers. She, like her father, had, through the toil and strife and\nstress of many lives of mingled good and evil, knowledge and ignorance,\nwon her way to the Perfect Knowledge; and so she knew that all these\npoor kings and slaves, conquerors and conquered, torturers and tortured,\nwere all doing the same thing, were all groping their way through the\nshadows and the night towards the dawn and the light, through the hell\nof ignorance to the heaven of knowledge.\n\nAnd now, too, since the Wisdom of the Ages was hers, she saw that over\nall the vast, weltering swarm of struggling immortals, hung the\ninevitable decree of silent, impersonal destiny. \"As ye live, so shall\nye die; as ye end, so shall ye begin again--in knowledge or ignorance,\nin good or evil, life after life, death after death, world without\nend.\"\n\nIt was clear to her now why \"some are born to honour and some to\ndishonour\": some to happiness and some to misery, each in his or her\ndegree; why the liver of a good life was happy, no matter what his place\nin the earth-life might be: and why the evil liver, no matter how high\nhe might stand in his own or others' sight, carried the canker of past\nmisdeeds in his heart. Standing, as she now did, in the midway of the\npresent, looking with single gaze on past and future, she saw at once\nthe honest striver after good in his yesterday-life rise to his reward\nin the life of to-day, and the dishonest rich and powerful sitting in\nthe high places of to-day cast down into the gutterways of to-morrow.\nLife had ceased to be a riddle to her now.\n\nWhat with their halts at Ostend, Cologne, and Hamburg, the\nthirty-three-hour journey lengthened itself out very pleasantly into a\nweek; and so, when the famous city on the Sound was reached, they were\nas fresh and unfatigued as they were on the morning that they left \"The\nWilderness.\" Of course, they put up at the H\u00f4tel d'Angleterre, and here\nthey enjoyed themselves quietly for four days, for of all European\ncapitals, Copenhagen is one of the pleasantest in which to idle a few\nfine summer days away.\n\nOn the evening of the fourth day they were just sitting down to their\ntable by one of the windows overlooking the Oestergade when Nitocris\nhappened to look up towards the door through which the diners were\ntrickling in an irregular stream of well-dressed men and women. For a\nmoment her eyes became fixed. Then she bent her head over the table, and\nsaid:\n\n\"Dad, there is Prince Oscarovitch. I wonder what he is doing here? He is\nalone: please go and ask him to join us. I will tell you why\nafterwards.\"\n\nThey exchanged glances, and the Professor got up and went towards the\ndoor, while his daughter got through a considerable amount of hard\nthinking in a very short time. She was, of course, perfectly conversant\nwith his share in the Zastrow affair, so far as her father had yet gone\nwith it; but she determined that when Copenhagen had gone to sleep that\nnight they would cross the Border and pay a visit to the Castle of\nTrelitz at the time of the tragedy, and follow it out as far as it had\ngone.\n\nIt has already been shown that on her first meeting with the Prince she\nconceived an aversion from him which was then inexplicable save by the\nordinary theory of natural antipathy: but now she knew that she had been\nNitocris, Queen of Egypt, when he was Menkau-Ra, the Lord of War, who\nwould have forced her to wed him by the might and terror of the sword,\nand the will of a blind and blood-intoxicated populace. She had hated\nhim then even to death, and now she hated him still in life; wherefore\nshe desired to make his closer acquaintance on the earth-plane on which\nthey had met once more after many lives.\n\nAs he had been in those far-off days, so he was now, a splendid specimen\nof aristocratic humanity. Many eyes had followed her as she had walked\nto her table, but there were more people in the room now, and as the\nPrince walked towards her beside the famous Professor who had puzzled\nall the mathematicians of Europe, the whole crowd of guests was looking\nat nothing but these three.\n\n\"This is indeed good fortune, Miss Marmion, and as good as it is\nunexpected--which, perhaps makes it all the better! Who would have\nthought of finding you in Copenhagen?\" he said, as he bowed low over her\nhand.\n\n\"If there is any reason at all for it, Prince, it is that my father and\nI always like to take our holidays at irregular times and in unexpected\nplaces: by which, I mean places where we do not expect to meet all our\nacquaintances,\" she replied, as she sat down. \"I think we manage to bore\neach other quite enough in London, and we like each other all the better\nwhen we meet again.\"\n\n\"Is not that rather an ungracious speech, Niti, seeing that one of the\nsaid acquaintances has only just chanced to join us?\" said the Professor\nmildly.\n\n\"You mean as regards the Prince?\" she laughed. \"Certainly not. His\nHighness is hardly an acquaintance--yet. You know we have only had the\npleasure of meeting him once: and then, of course, I said _all_ our\nacquaintances. There might be exceptions.\"\n\nThese words, spoken with a quite indescribable charm, were, as he\nthought, quite the sweetest that Oscarovitch had heard for many a day.\nIt had been perfectly easy for a man with his official influence to\ntrace by telegraph every movement that the Marmions had made after he\nhad guessed that they would travel by either Calais or Ostend. He had\nwired for his yacht, the _Grashna_, to meet him at Dover, run across to\nOstend, found that they had left there for Cologne with through tickets\nfor Copenhagen, again guessed rightly that they would spend a few days\nthere and in Hamburg, and then steam away for the Sound.\n\nThe farther north he travelled, the farther he left Phadrig and his\nphantasies behind, and the nearer he came to the belief that, if he had\nonly a fair chance and the field to himself, as he intended to have, he\nwould not find very much difficulty in convincing Nitocris that there\nwas no comparison at all between the humble naval officer she had left\nbehind to do his work on his dirty little destroyer, and the millionaire\nPrince who could give her one of the noblest names in Europe and\neverything that the heart of woman could desire. And now these\nsweetly-spoken words and the glance which accompanied them, her\nundisguised pleasure at the chance meeting, and her father's very\nevident approval of his presence, quickly but finally convinced him\nthat he had come to a perfectly just conclusion.\n\nOf course, there was the memory of another woman, only a little less\nfair than Nitocris, who had shut herself up yonder in the gloomy Castle\nof Trelitz, acting the farce of her official sorrow for love of him, and\npining for the time when the finding of her betrayed husband's corpse\nshould leave her free, after a decent interval of mock-mourning, to join\nher lot with his: but what did that matter? Was it not as easy to get\nrid of a woman as a man? Was not the fatal beauty of the Horus Stone at\nhis command now that he was its possessor for good or evil? A\nwell-arranged suicide might easily be taken by the world as the\nexcusable, if deplorable, result of her mysterious bereavement.\n\nThe conversation during dinner naturally turned on ways and means of\ntravelling, and, when the Professor had sketched out their plans,\nOscarovitch said with an admirably simulated deference:\n\n\"My dear sir, I most sincerely hope that you and Miss Marmion will not\nthink that I am presuming on an acquaintance which, if only a new one\nnow, may perhaps one day be older, if I venture to suggest another way\nof making your tour. I am an old voyager in these waters, and I can\nassure you that the steamers, though vastly improved, have not quite\nreached the standard of the Atlantic liner.\"\n\n\"Oh, but you know, Prince, we didn't expect it,\" interrupted Nitocris.\n\"Neither my father nor I have the slightest objection to roughing it a\nlittle. In fact, that is half the fun of wandering.\"\n\n\"And slow travelling between stated points, not always of the greatest\nor any interest, together with the enforced company of a promiscuous\ncrowd of tourists and commercial travellers, who, by the way, are mostly\nGerman, and therefore of nature and necessity disagreeable, would about\nmake up the other half,\" said Oscarovitch, leaning back in his chair\nwith a low laugh. \"No, no, my dear Miss Marmion, I am afraid you would\nnot find that the reality quite squared with the anticipation. Now, may\nI risk the suspicion of presumption and offer an alternative\nproposition?\"\n\n\"Why not?\" said Nitocris with a smile, and a glance which dazzled him.\n\"I'm sure it is very kind of you to take so much interest in our poor\nlittle attempt to get away for a while from the madding crowd who are\ndoing the round of the same stale, weary pleasures that they try so hard\nto enjoy year after year, and then come back _so_ tired, after all.\"\n\n\"Then,\" he replied, looking at them alternately, \"as I have your\npermission, I would suggest that, instead of rushing from fixed point to\nfixed point in crowded steamers and the shackles of Company or\nGovernment regulations, you should take possession of a fairly\ncomfortable steam yacht of a little over a thousand tons which will be\nentirely at your disposal, and will run you from anywhere to anywhere\nyou choose at any speed you like, from five to thirty-five knots an\nhour, with properly trained servants to attend to you, and, as the\nadvertisements say, 'every possible comfort and convenience.'\"\n\n\"Which, of course, means that you have got your yacht here, and are so\nvery kind as to ask us to become your guests for a time,\" said the\nProfessor, with a suspicion of stiffness. \"It is more than generous of\nyou, Prince, but really----\"\n\n\"But really, my dear sir,\" Oscarovitch interrupted, with a gesture of\ndeprecation, \"I can assure you that, so far as I am concerned, there is\nno kindness, to say nothing of generosity. It is pure selfishness. This\nis my position. I have managed to escape for a time from the toils of\nofficial work and worry, and the almost equally irksome bonds of that\nform of penal servitude which is called Society. Like you, I have fled\noverseas, but, unlike you, I have no company but my own, and I have had\na great deal too much of that already, though I have only been three\ndays and nights at sea. I have no plans, I have got nothing to do and\nnowhere to go; and so, if you and Miss Marmion would take pity on my\nloneliness all the generosity would be on your side. Of course, I cannot\npresume to ask you to change your plans all at once, but if you will\nsleep on my proposition and come and lunch with me to-morrow on board\nthe _Grashna_ and take a run up the Sound, say, to Elsinore, you may be\nable to come to a decision.\"\n\nIt was a lovely night, and so they took their coffee and liqueurs, and\nthe two men their smokes on the balcony overlooking the Oestergade,\nwhich might be called the Rue de la Paix of Copenhagen, and watched the\nwell-dressed crowds sauntering to and fro past the brilliantly lighted\nshops; and Nitocris, who seemed to her father to be in singularly high\nspirits, sent the conversation rippling over all manner of subjects with\nthe exception of politics and the Fourth Dimension. Oscarovitch was\nbecoming more and more fascinated as the light-winged minutes sped by,\nand he took but little pains to conceal the fact. Nitocris, of course,\nsaw this, and simulated a delightful unconsciousness. The Professor was,\nfor the time being, completely mystified. He knew that his daughter\nhated the Prince with a thorough cordiality, and yet he had never seen\nher make herself so entirely charming to any man, not even excepting\nMerrill himself, as she was to this man, her enemy of the Ages. He could\nhave solved the problem instantly by crossing the Border, but then the\nsudden vanishing of a famous scientist from the midst of the brilliant\ncompany on the balcony would have set all the newspapers in Europe\nchattering, with consequences which would have been the reverse of\npleasant both to his daughter and himself.\n\nHowever, he had not long to wait, for Nitocris soon rose, saying that\nshe must go to Jenny, her maid, to see about packing arrangements for\nto-morrow; and the Prince, after another cigarette and liqueur, took his\nleave and went on board the yacht to give orders for her to be put into\nher best trim, and then to have a luxurious half-hour with the Horus\nStone, and indulge in fond imaginings as to how it would look hanging\nfrom a chain of diamonds on the white breast of Miss Nitocris.\n\nWhen the Professor went to his own sitting-room he found his daughter\nwaiting to say good-night.\n\n\"Niti,\" he said, as he closed the door, \"I don't want to seem\ninquisitive, but, frankly, I was astounded at the gracious way in which\nyou treated that scoundrel Oscarovitch.\"\n\n\"Dad,\" she replied, with apparent irrelevance, \"do you believe in the\nforgiveness of sins?\"\n\n\"Of course not! How could any one who holds the Doctrine do that? We\nknow that every moral debit must be worked off and turned into a credit\nby the sinner, however many lives of suffering it takes to do it. Why do\nyou ask?\"\n\n\"So that you might answer as you have done!\" she said, with a little\nlaugh. \"Now this Oscarovitch has sinned grievously, not only in this\nlife but in many others, and I am going to see that he works off at\nleast some of his debit as you put it somewhat commercially. He loved me\nin the old days in Memphis, and he loves me still in the same brutal,\nanimal way. I know that if he cannot get me by fair means he will try to\ntake me by force--and I am going to let him do it.\"\n\n\"Niti!\"\n\n\"Yes, he shall take me; he shall think he had got me safe away from you\nand Mark--and when he has got me he shall taste what the hot-and-strong\nsort of Christian preachers call the torments of the damned. No, I shall\nnot kill him. He shall live till he prays to all his gods, if he has\nany, that he may die. He shall hunger without eating, thirst without\ndrinking, lie down without sleeping, have wealth that he cannot spend,\nand palaces so hideously haunted that he dare not live in them, until,\nwhen men wish to illustrate the uttermost extreme of human misery, they\nshall point to Prince Oscarovitch. I, the Queen, have said it!\"\n\nThen, with a swift change of voice and manner, she laid her hands on her\nfather's shoulders, kissed him, and murmured:\n\n\"Good-night, Dad--at least as far as this world is concerned.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nWHAT HAPPENED AT TRELITZ\n\n\nIt was the 6th of June again.\n\nOnce more Prince Zastrow rode with Ulik von Kessner and Alexis Vollmar\nand the attendant huntsmen up the avenue of pines leading to the gate of\nthe Castle of Trelitz, but now accompanied by two unseen Presences which\nbelonged at once to their own world and also to another and wider one.\nOnce more the great doors opened and they passed into the trophy-decked,\nskin-carpeted hall: and once more they were welcomed by the stately,\nsilken-clad woman who came down the broad staircase to greet her lord\nand his guests. Emil von Zastrow, last and worthiest scion of his\nancient line, the very _beau ideal_ of youthful strength and manly\ndignity, ran half-way up the stairs to meet his lady and his love, and\nthen the men went away to their rooms, while the Princess Hermia, true\nhousewife as well as princess, betook herself to the pleasant task of\nmaking sure that all the preparations for dinner were complete.\n\nThe dinner was served in one of the smaller rooms, in the modern wing of\nthe Castle, on an oval table. The Prince sat at one end faced by his\nbeautiful consort. To his right sat his guest, Alexis Vollmar, and a\ntall, handsome, but somewhat hard-featured woman of about thirty, with\nthe clear blue eyes and thick, yellow-gold hair which proclaimed her a\ndaughter of the northern German lowlands. This was Hulda von Tyssen, the\nPrincess's companion and lady-in-waiting. They were faced by a stout,\npowerfully-built man with a full beard and moustache _\u00e0 la_ Friedrich,\nUlik von Kessner, High Chamberlain of Boravia. Captain Alexis Vollmar\nwas a typical Russian officer of the younger school, tall, well-set-up,\nand good-looking after the Muscovite fashion. He had distinguished\nhimself in the Far East, but just now he preferred the serene atmosphere\nof Boravia to the thunder-laden air of Holy Russia.\n\nThe talk was of hunting and war and politics and the chances of the\nRussian revolution, and on this latter subject it was perfectly\nunrestrained, for all knew that the Powers had made a secret compact by\nwhich they bound themselves, in the event of the fall of the Romanoff\nDynasty and the Arch-Ducal oligarchy--which all Europe would be very\nglad to see the last of--to support Prince Zastrow as elective candidate\nfor the vacant throne.\n\nThe Revolutionary leaders had been sounded on the subject, and were\nfound strongly in favour of the scheme. It meant a return to the ancient\nprinciple of elected monarchy, and Prince Zastrow, though now a German\nruling prince, represented the union of two of the oldest and noblest\nfamilies in Russia and Poland. Moreover, he had pledged himself to a\nConstitution which, without going to Radical or Socialistic extremes,\nembodied all that the moderate and responsible adherents of the\nRevolutionary cause desired or considered suitable for the people in\ntheir present stage of political development--which, of course, meant\neverything that Oscar Oscarovitch did not want.\n\nAfter dinner they went out through the long French windows on to a\nverandah which overlooked a vast sea of forest, lying dark and seemingly\nlimitless under the fading daylight and the radiance of the brightening\nmoon. Since their marriage day the Prince had made it a bargain that\nwhenever they dined _en famille_, his wife should prepare his coffee\nwith her own hands. She even roasted the berries and ground them\nherself, and, as many a time before, she did it to-night in the\nseclusion of the little room set apart for that and similar purposes.\nShe was alone in the physical sense, for the two watching Presences were\ninvisible to her, and so, for all she knew, no one saw her measure\ntwenty drops of a colourless fluid from a little blue bottle into the\ncoronetted cup of almost transparent porcelain which had been one of her\nwedding presents to her husband.\n\nAfter a couple of cups of coffee and half a dozen half-smoked\ncigarettes, the Prince stretched his long legs out, struggled with a\nyawn, and said in a sleepy voice:\n\n\"My Princess, you must ask our guests to excuse me. I am tired after the\nlong day in the sun; and so, if I may, I will go to bed.\"\n\nHe rose, and the rest rose at the same moment. He bowed his good-night,\nand the two saluted. The Princess followed him into the dining-room.\n\nThe unseen watchers stood by the end of the great heavily-hung bed, in\nthe midst of which lay Prince Zastrow, seemingly sinking into the\nslumber of death. Von Kessner leaned over and raised an eyelid, and said\nto the Princess, who was standing on the other side, the single word:\n\"Unconscious.\" She bent forward for a moment as though she were bidding\na silent farewell to the man to whom she had pledged her maiden troth,\nthen straightened up and walked like some beautiful simulacrum of a\nwoman towards the door which Vollmar held open for her....\n\nThe earth-hours passed, and the two men kept their watch by the bed,\nconversing now and then in whispers between long intervals of anxious\nsilence, until three strokes sounded from the bell of the Castle clock.\nThe whole household, save one fair woman, who, in softly-slippered feet,\nwas pacing the floor of her bedroom, was fast asleep, and the days of\nsentries were far past. Von Kessner gently lifted one of the arms lying\non the coverlet of the bed and let it fall. It dropped as the arm of a\nman who had just died might have done. Again he raised an eyelid, this\ntime with some difficulty. The eyeball beneath was fixed and glassy as\nthat of a corpse. He nodded across the bed to the Russian, and together\nthey turned the bedclothes down to the foot. Then from under the bed he\npulled out a bundle of grey skins which he spread on the floor beside\nthe bed. It was a sleeping bag such as hunters use in winter on the\nsnow-swept plains and forests of Northern Europe. Vollmar turned the\nhead-flap back. Then they lifted the body of the Prince from the bed,\nslid it into the sack, and buttoned the flap down over the face.\n\n\"That Egyptian's drug has worked well,\" whispered Von Kessner.\n\nVollmar nodded, and whispered back:\n\n\"I wish I had a handful of it. But it is time. He will be ready for us\nnow.\"\n\nEven as he spoke the locked door opened, as it were of its own accord,\nand Phadrig stood in the room dressed in the livery of the Prince's\ncoachman. Von Kessner and Vollmar turned grey as he bowed, and\nwhispered:\n\n\"The doors are open, Excellencies, and all is ready!\"\n\nThen the three lifted the shapeless bag and carried it with noiseless\ntread down to the hall and out through the half-open doors to where a\ncarriage drawn by four black horses stood waiting. Though there was no\none in charge of them, they stood as still as though carved out of\nblocks of black marble until the body of the Prince had been laid in the\ncarriage and Von Kessner and Vollmar had taken their places beside it.\nThen Phadrig mounted the box, shook the reins, and the rubber-shod\nhorses moved silently away at a trot, which, as soon as the main road\nwas reached, became a gallop only a little less silent than the trot.\n\nThe carriage turned aside from the road, and ran down a broad forest\nlane till it stopped by the shore of a little sandy inlet. The bow of a\nlong black boat was resting on the sand, and six closely-blindfolded men\nwere sitting on the thwarts with oars out. Another stood on the beach\nwith the painter in his hands. The body of the Prince was carried from\nthe carriage to the boat, and laid in the stern sheets. Von Kessner and\nVollmar remained on board, and Phadrig went back to the carriage. At a\nshort word of command the oarsman backed hard, and the boat slid off the\nsand into the smooth water of the little cove. Then she shot away and\nmelted into the light haze which hung over the outside sea.\n\nThe boat stopped under the shadow of the long, low-lying black hull of a\nfour-funnelled destroyer. A rope dropped from the deck and was made fast\nby Vollmar in the bow. The blindfolded crew were helped up the ladder\nwhich hung over the side and taken below forward. Then came a sharp\norder: \"All hands below\"; and when the deck was deserted, Von Kessner\nand Vollmar went up the ladder and were met on deck by Oscar Oscarovitch\nin civilian dress. There was another man beside him in the uniform of a\nlieutenant. He slacked off the tackle falls of the davits under which\nthe boat had brought up, dropped down the ladder and hooked them on.\nWhen he got back to the deck the four men hauled first on one tackle\nand then on the other, till the boat was up flush with the deck. The\nfalls were belayed, and Oscarovitch got into the boat and opened the\nflap of the sleeping-sack. He touched the spring of an electric\npocket-lamp and looked upon the calm, cold features of his rival. Then\nhe buttoned down the flap again and returned to the deck. The four went\ndown into the cabin: glasses were filled with champagne, and as\nOscarovitch raised his to his lips, he said:\n\n\"Count and Captain Vollmar, I am satisfied. Let us drink to the New\nEmpire of the Russias and the sceptre of Ivan the Terrible!\"\n\n\"And his illustrious successor!\" added Von Kessner.\n\nWithin half an hour a small boat was lowered; the Chamberlain and\nVollmar got into it and rowed away toward the cove. The Russian officer\nwent on to the little bridge, signalled \"full speed ahead\" to the\nengine-room, and then took the wheel. The screws ground the water astern\ninto foam, the black shape leapt forward and sped away eastward into the\nglimmering dawn with its silent passenger lying in the swinging boat,\nand the unseen watchers standing by the helmsman....\n\nMore earth-hours passed. The sun rose upon a lonely sea. The destroyer\nstopped, and a white speck on the eastward horizon rapidly grew into the\nwhite shape of a large yacht flying through the water at a tremendous\nspeed. In a few minutes she was almost alongside. She swung round in a\nsharp curve, slowed down and dropped a boat. Oscarovitch and the\nlieutenant lowered the destroyer's boat till it touched the water. The\nother came alongside, and the body of Prince Zastrow was transferred to\nit, and Oscarovitch followed it. Four men from the yacht's boat jumped\non board the destroyer and hauled hers up. The other was backed to the\nladder and they came on board. A silent salute passed between\nOscarovitch and the lieutenant, and a few minutes later the yacht's boat\nwas hoisted to the davits, and the white shape was growing smaller and\ndimmer amidst the light haze that lay on the water shimmering under the\nslanting rays of the rising sun.\n\nMorning grew into noon, noon faded into evening, and evening darkened\ninto night. The yacht ran into a wide-opening gulf between two\nforest-clad points, on the southern of which twinkled the lights of a\nlarge town. These were soon left behind by the flying yacht, and as a\nvast sea of fleecy cloud drifted up from the north-east and spread its\nveil across the path of the half moon, a little cluster of lights\ngleamed out on the port bow. Her bowsprit swerved to the left till it\npointed directly to them. Presently she slowed down and ran into a\nlittle land-locked bay surrounded with dense pine woods which came down\nalmost to the water's edge, swung round and slowed up alongside a wooden\njetty. From this a broad road, cut straight through the forest, sloped\nsteeply up to a plateau on which stood a gaunt, grey, turreted castle,\nthe very picture of the sea-robbers' home that it had been in the days\nof Oscarovitch's not very remote ancestors. Up this road and into the\nouter gate across the lowered drawbridge the sleeping-sack and the\ninsensible man within were borne. Through the keep-yard it was taken\ninto the Castle and up to a large room in the eastern turret,\ncomfortably furnished, and containing a bed almost as luxurious as that\nin which Prince Zastrow had lain down to sleep the evening before.\nOscarovitch preceded the men who carried him, and was met at the door by\na grey-haired, keen-eyed man, who bowed before him, and said in a low\ntone:\n\n\"May I presume to ask if this is my charge, Highness?\"\n\n\"It is, Doctor Hugo; and I give him into your hands with every\nconfidence that you will restore your patient to health as quickly as\nany man in Europe could do. I must leave immediately, and so I trust\neverything to you. All care must be taken of him. He must want for\nnothing that you can give him--except liberty.\"\n\nOscarovitch returned the doctor's assenting bow and left the room. In\nhalf an hour the yacht was flying at full speed over the smooth waters\nof the Baltic, heading a little to the south of West.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nA TRIP ON THE SOUND\n\n\n\"Good morning, Dad,\" said Nitocris, as she entered the sitting-room\nabout half an hour before breakfast the next morning. \"What is your\nopinion of the European situation now?\"\n\n\"Good morning, Niti; what is yours?\" asked her father, looking at her\nwith grave eyes and smiling lips.\n\n\"As it was yesterday, only rather more so. In his present incarnation,\nPrince Oscar Oscarovitch is, I should think, about as black-hearted a\nscoundrel as ever polluted the air that honest people breathe.\"\n\n\"I entirely agree with you. And now, believing that, do you still\npropose to trust yourself to his tender mercies on board his own yacht,\nsurrounded, as you will be, by men who, no doubt, are his absolute\nslaves?\"\n\n\"_I_ trust myself to his tender mercies, Dad?\" she replied, drawing\nherself up and throwing her head back a little; \"you seem to have got\nhold of the thing by the wrong end, as Brenda would say. That is only\nwhat it will look like. The reality will be that he will blindly trust\nhimself to _my_ mercies--and I can assure you that he will find them\nanything but tender. No, dear, we shall accept His Highness's invitation\nto lunch, and then his offer of the hospitality of the yacht for the\ntrip, which, by the way, I fancy will be more to the eastward than to\nthe northward----\"\n\n\"You mean, I suppose, Trelitz and Viborg?\"\n\n\"Not Trelitz, I think, but Viborg almost certainly. That will be the end\nof the abduction as far as I can see from our present plane of\nexistence.\"\n\n\"Really, Niti--well, well. Of course, I know that you will be perfectly\nsafe: but what would our good friends on this plane, as you put it, the\nVan Huysmans, for instance, think if they could hear you talking so\ncalmly to your own father about getting yourself abducted by a man whom\nyou justly think to be one of the most unscrupulous scoundrels on earth!\nAnd, by the way, what is to become of me in the carrying out of this\nlittle scheme of yours? I hope you don't expect me to connive at the\nabduction of my own daughter. I have a certain amount of reputation to\nlose, you know.\"\n\n\"Oh, if His Highness is the clever villain that we know him to be, I\nthink we may safely trust him to arrange for your temporary\ndisappearance from the scene. And whatever he does it will be easy for\nyou to play the part of the passive victim for the time being. He can't\ninjure or kill you, for if it came to extremities you have the means of\ngiving his people such a fright as would probably drive them out of\ntheir senses, just as I could if their master got troublesome. Really,\nfrom a certain point of view, the adventure will have a decidedly\nhumorous aspect.\"\n\n\"With a very considerable leaven of tragedy.\"\n\n\"Yes, the tragedy will be a logical sequence of the comedy--and, as I\nsaid last night, it will be tragedy. And now suppose we go to breakfast.\nI have been up nearly two hours helping Jenny with the packing, and this\nlovely air has given me a raging appetite. There's a little more to do\nyet, and we shall have His Highness here before long to ask for our\ndecision and take us off to the yacht.\"\n\nHere she was quite right, for she had hardly left her father to his\nafter-breakfast pipe and gone upstairs to help her maid, than\nOscarovitch came into the smoking-room.\n\n\"Good morning, Professor Marmion! I need not ask you if you have had a\ngood night. You look the very picture of a man who has slept the sleep\nof the just. And Miss Marmion?\"\n\n\"Thanks, Your Highness, I think we have both managed to spend the night\nto good purpose. The air here is glorious just now. I always think that\nsound, dreamless sleep is the best sign that a place is doing you good.\"\n\n\"Oh, undoubtedly, though for some reason or other I did not sleep very\nwell last night. Something had disagreed with me, I suppose. I seemed to\nhave a sense of being pursued to the uttermost ends of the earth and\nback again by some relentless foe who simply would not allow me to take\na moment's rest. But I didn't come to talk about the stuff that dreams\nare made of. I came to ask whether my cruise is to be a lonely one, or\nwhether I am to have the very great pleasure of your company.\"\n\nFranklin Marmion, for perhaps the first time in his life, felt\ndistinctly murderous towards a fellow-creature as he looked at this\nsplendid specimen of physical humanity, knowing so well the real man who\nwas hiding behind that fascinating exterior; but he managed to answer\npleasantly enough:\n\n\"We have talked the matter over, Prince, and we have come to the\nconclusion that your very kind invitation is really too good to be\nrefused. We know that we are incurring a debt that we shall not be able\nto pay, but we are trusting to your generosity to let us off.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, my dear Professor,\" said Oscarovitch, without the\nslightest attempt to conceal the pleasure that the acceptation gave him,\n\"it is yourself and Miss Marmion who have made me your debtor. In fact,\nif you had not found yourselves able to come, I should have run the\n_Grashna_ back to Cowes, gone up to London, plunged into a maelstr\u00f6m of\ndissipation, and probably ended by losing a great deal of money at Ascot\nand Goodwood. Ah, Miss Marmion, good morning! How well the air of\nCopenhagen seems to agree with you! The Professor has just gladdened my\nsoul by telling me that you have decided to take pity on my loneliness.\"\n\n\"Good morning, Prince!\" she replied, putting her hand for a moment in\nthe one he held out. \"Yes, we are coming, if you will have us. In fact,\nI have just finished packing.\"\n\n\"Ah, excellent! Well now, since that is happily arranged, it would be a\npity to waste any of this lovely morning. The Sound is like a streak of\nblue sky fallen from heaven. My gig is down at the jetty, and I have a\ncouple of my men here who will convoy your baggage down. If it is\npacked, as you say, you need not trouble about it. You will find\neverything safe on board.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Prince,\" said the Professor. \"Then I will go and settle up\nat the office while Niti puts her hat on. I will have the things sent\ndown, and we may as well walk to the jetty. It will do me good after\nthat big breakfast. Jenny had better get into a cab and go down with the\nluggage.\"\n\nWhen they reached the promenade along the Sound shore Oscarovitch\npointed to a beautifully-shaped, three-masted, two-funnelled white yacht\nlying about five hundred yards out, and said:\n\n\"That is the _Grashna_, Miss Marmion. I hope you like the look of her.\"\n\n\"She is beautiful!\" exclaimed Nitocris, recognising at once the vessel\nwhich had met the Russian destroyer on the early morning of the 7th.\n\"She almost looks as if she could fly.\"\n\n\"So she can in a sense,\" laughed the Prince. \"Come now, here is the gig.\nWe will get on board, and you shall see her go through her paces.\"\n\nNeither she nor her father were strangers to yachts, but when they\nmounted the bridge of the _Grashna_ and looked over her from stem to\nstern, they had to admit that they had never seen anything quite so\ndaintily splendid. They had chosen their rooms, and Jenny was below\nunpacking. Although, of course, he had a captain on board, the Prince\noften sailed the yacht himself when he had guests on board. He had a\ngenuine love for the beautiful craft, and he took an almost boyish\ndelight in showing what she could do. She was a twelve-hundred-ton,\ntriple-screw, turbine-driven boat, and, thanks to the space-economy of\nthe new system, her builders had been able to stow away fifteen thousand\nhorse-power in her engine-room, and this when fully developed gave a\nspeed in smooth water of thirty-five knots or a little over forty\nstatute miles an hour.\n\nThe anchor was up almost as soon as they got on to the bridge, and\nOscarovitch moved the pointer of the telegraph to \"Ahead slow.\" The\nquartermaster in the oval wheel-house behind him moved the little wheel\na few spokes to starboard, her mellow whistle tooted, and she glided in\nan outward curve through the other yachts and shipping, and gained the\nopen water.\n\n\"Now,\" he said, turning to Nitocris, \"we can begin to move. It is\nroughly thirty English miles to Elsinore. If you have never done any\nfast travelling at sea and would like to do some now, I can get you\nthere in about three-quarters of an hour.\"\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed the Professor, \"thirty miles in forty-five minutes by\nsea! That is over forty miles an hour. A wonderful speed.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he replied, almost tenderly; \"but my beautiful _Grashna_ is a\nwonderful craft--at least, I think you will say so when you see what she\ncan do. Now, if you will take advice, you and Miss Marmion will go into\nshelter, for it will begin to blow soon.\"\n\nBehind the wheel-house was an observation room, as it would be called in\nthe States, running nearly the whole length of the bridge, and fronted\nwith thick plate glass. They went in, and Oscarovitch turned the pointer\nto half-speed. There was no increase in vibration, but the shore began\nto slip away behind them faster and faster, and the northern suburbs of\nCopenhagen rose ahead and fell astern as though they were part of a\nswiftly moving panorama. Then the pointer went down to full speed, and\nthe Prince, after a word to the quartermaster, joined them in the\nbridge-house and closed the door.\n\n\"You will need all your eyes to see much of the shore now,\" he said; \"I\nhave given her her wings.\"\n\nNitocris felt a shudder in the carpeted floor. Looking ahead she saw the\nbow lift slightly. Then a smooth, green swathe of water curled up on\neither side. She looked aft, and saw a broad torrent of froth, foaming\nlike a furious, rapid stream away from the stern. The houses and trees\non the shore seemed to run into each other, and slide out of sight\nalmost before the eye could rest upon them. The water alongside was\nmerely a blue-green blur. Nitocris involuntarily held her breath as\nthough she had been out on deck.\n\n\"It is wonderful, Prince!\" she said, almost in a whisper. \"That alleged\nexpress from Hamburg was nothing to this: and yet how steadily she moves\nin spite of the speed. I should have thought that it would have nearly\nshaken us to jelly.\"\n\n\"That is the turbines, dear,\" said her father, who was already wondering\nwhether Oscarovitch was doing this just to show how hopeless any pursuit\nof such a vessel would be. \"They are a marvellous means of applying\nsteam power. Lieutenant Parsons is robbing the sea of one, at least, of\nits worst terrors.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" added the Prince, \"we are travelling a little over forty miles an\nhour; and if you got that speed out of reciprocating engines you would\nscarcely be able to lie on the deck without holding on to something, yet\nhere we are as comfortable as though we were standing in a\ndrawing-room.\"\n\n\"You have given us a new experience to begin with,\" said Nitocris,\nthinking how nice it would be to take her wedding trip with Merrill in\nsuch a craft as this. \"Why, look at the two shores coming together,\nDad!\"\n\n\"No, excuse me,\" said Oscarovitch, \"we are only about half-way to the\nGate of the Baltic yet. That land on the right is the island of Hvreen.\nWhen we have passed that you will soon see the heights of Elsinore and\nHelsingborg rising ahead. There are only about two and a half miles\nbetween Denmark and Sweden there.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, of course. I am forgetting my geography,\" laughed Nitocris, as\nthe low, wooded patch of land came rushing towards them as though it\nwere adrift on a fast-flowing stream. \"Goodness, what a speed!\"\n\n\"A very wonderful craft, Prince,\" added the Professor, as the island\ndrifted past; \"she quite inclines me towards a breach of the tenth\ncommandment. Now that you have given us this taste of the delights of\nspeed, I think that if I were a millionaire, I should try to build one\nto beat her.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" laughed Oscarovitch. \"It is marvellous this fascination of\nspeed. Your poet, Henley, touched the pulse of the times when he wrote\nthose splendid lines of his. But surely, Professor, _you_ would not have\nvery much difficulty in leaving all far behind. A man to whom\nmathematical impossibilities are as easy as an addition sum ought to be\nable to realise the dream of the ages and solve the problem of aerial\nnavigation.\"\n\nHe looked him straight in the eyes as he said this. He fully believed in\nthe possibility of human flight, given the transcendent genius who could\nwork out the equation of weight and power. Perhaps that genius might be\nwith him now in the bridge-house. His vivid imagination was already\npicturing the lovely girl at his side crowned Empress of the Russias and\nthe East, and himself in command of an aerial navy, beneath whose\nassault the armies and navies and fortresses of the rest of the world\nwould be as so many toys to play with and destroy.\n\n\"If I could do that, and I do not think it would be so very difficult\nafter all,\" said Franklin Marmion, returning his glance, \"I would not\ndo it. It would put too much power in the hands of a few men, and we\nhave enough of that already. The owner of a fleet of aerial warships\nwould be above all human law. He could terrorise the earth, and make\nmankind his slaves. Life would become unendurable under such conditions.\nCommercialism, which only means slavery plus the liberty to starve, is\nbad enough, but it is at least possible. The other would be impossible.\nThere is no man quite honest enough to be trusted with such a power as\nthat. I have worked the thing out, and it is perfectly feasible, but I\nburnt my designs and calculations.\"\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed Oscarovitch, flushing in spite of his effort to keep\nthe blood back from his face. \"You have solved the problem, and won't\nmake use of the greatest invention of all the ages! Surely, Professor,\nthat is a little quixotic, is it not?\"\n\n\"Who am I that I should bring a curse upon humanity, Prince?\" he\nanswered gravely. \"Do you not kill each other fast enough now? No, the\nworld is not fit for such a development yet. My results will remain my\nown until Tom Hood's ideal of good government has been realised.\"\n\n\"And what was that, Dad?\" asked Nitocris, who had a double reason for\nbeing interested in the conversation. \"If I ever knew it, I have\nforgotten it.\"\n\n\"Despotism, Niti--and an angel from heaven for the despot,\" he replied,\nwith another look into the Prince's eyes which brought him to the\nconclusion that the sooner his presence on board the _Grashna_ was\ndispensed with the better for his plans. There was a sense of quiet\nmastery in Franklin Marmion's manner which made him uneasy.\n\n\"Ah! there is the famous fortress, is it not? the home of Hamlet and\nOphelia and the Ghost!\" she exclaimed, pointing ahead to where a\ngrey-blue mass was rising out of the water. \"Do you believe in ghosts,\nPrince?\" she added suddenly, flashing a glance at him which seemed to\npierce his brain like a ray of unearthly light.\n\n\"Ghosts? No, Miss Marmion. I'm afraid I am too hopelessly materialistic\nfor that. I never saw or heard of an authentic ghost, and I do not\npropose to believe until I see.\"\n\n\"We have a ghost at 'The Wilderness,'--the wraith of a poor young lady\nwho killed herself after some royal blackguard had abused his own\nhospitality. She often comes to visit me in my study,\" said the\nProfessor, as though he were relating the most ordinary occurrence.\n\n\"Ah,\" smiled the Prince, \"that is very interesting: but, of course, it\nwould be in the power of a man like yourself to have experiences which\nare denied to ordinary mortals. Still, granted all that, I confess that\nI have often wondered whether or not I should be frightened if I really\ndid see a ghost.\"\n\n\"Yes, I wonder?\" murmured Nitocris, with a great deal more meaning than\nhe had any idea of just then.\n\nAll three felt that the conversation was getting a little difficult, and\nthey were not sorry when the rapid rising of the rock of Elsinore made\nit necessary for Oscarovitch to go out to the engine telegraph.\n\n\"His Highness doesn't believe in ghosts now,\" whispered Nitocris to her\nfather, when the door shut behind him, \"but I think he will before very\nlong. I wonder what he is really going to do? I've half a mind to----\"\n\n\"No, no, Niti,\" he said quickly; \"keep this side of the Border till you\nreally have to cross it. What on earth, literally, would happen if he\ncame back and found me standing here alone?\"\n\n\"Oh, of course I didn't mean it,\" she smiled. \"It would be very poor\nsport to spoil both the comedy and the tragedy before the curtain goes\nup. I wonder if the drama will begin to-night? I shouldn't be\nsurprised.\"\n\n\"Nor I,\" said the Professor, a trifle grimly. \"I didn't at all like his\nlooks when I was talking about the flying machine. The brute looked as\nif he were quite capable of locking me up and starving or torturing me\nuntil I gave him the secret. My word, I should like to see him try! I'd\nhave him grovelling at my feet in five minutes.\"\n\nThe door opened and Oscarovitch came in. He took off the cap which had\nbeen pulled tight over his eyes, and said:\n\n\"Well, we have arrived! Almost exactly forty-five minutes. There is\nElsinore, there is Kronborg, King Frederick's sixteenth-century castle,\nand there is Marienlyst, which is to Copenhagen what Brighton is to\nLondon, only, I must say, in a much more refined sense. Now what is\nyour pleasure, Miss Marmion? We have still nearly two hours before\nlunch, so, if you would like an hour's stroll ashore, the gig will be\nready in a couple of minutes.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Prince,\" she said with a rewarding smile. \"Dad, what do you\nthink? It all looks very beautiful under this sun and sky.\"\n\n\"Which, of course, means that you want to go ashore, Niti,\" said her\nfather. \"For my own part, I certainly should like a little walk on new\nground. I have never been here before.\"\n\n\"Then, of course we will go,\" said Oscarovitch, opening the door and\ngoing to the telegraph.\n\nThe yacht came to a standstill in a few minutes, and the gig was waiting\nat the foot of the gangway ladder. They spent a very pleasant hour\nashore, and what they saw, you may read of in your Murray and Baedeker,\nwherefore there is no need to set it down here. When they came aboard\nagain, lunch was almost ready, and the steward presented his master and\nthe Professor with quite exceptional cocktails in the smoking-room. Then\nthey went and had a wash, and the mellow gong sounded.\n\nI am not very fond of those descriptions in stories which read like\nextracts from an upholsterer's price-list, nor yet those accounts of\nmeals that, after all, are only menus writ large, so it may suffice to\nsay that the saloon of the _Grashna_ was an arrangement of sandal-wood\npanels, framed in thin silver filigree, and hung with exquisite little\nmasterpieces in water-colour, and black and white, and crayon, mostly\nsea-scapes, with here and there a beautiful head with living eyes which\nfollowed you everywhere; that the rich yellow of the panels was enhanced\nby _porti\u00e8res_ and curtains of deep golden-bronze silk, and that the\ndomed ceiling was of pale, sky-blue enamel spangled with the\nconstellations of the northern heavens, which at night lit up the whole\nsaloon with a soft electric radiance. As for the lunch, it was as nearly\nperfect as the best-paid chef afloat could make it, after his master had\nasked him as a personal favour to do so.\n\nThey ran back quietly to Copenhagen at twenty knots, and Oscarovitch and\nthe Professor went ashore to send off a few telegrams, leaving Nitocris,\nfor her own reasons, to make herself at home on the yacht. They returned\nin time to dress for dinner and enjoy a stroll on the broad upper deck,\nand watch the sunset over the town and the quickly-increasing sparkle of\nthe myriad lights on shore and sea. When they came up after dinner,\nthese lights were only represented by a luminous haze glimmering under\nthe stars to the northward. The _Grashna_ was heading nearly due south\nat an easy speed towards the Baltic Islands.\n\nSomething told both Nitocris and her father that the decisive hour would\ncome soon, and they were both prepared for its advent.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nTHE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE PROFESSOR\n\n\nThe Prince and the Professor sat up in the smoking-room for a\nconsiderable time after Nitocris had retired. Oscarovitch was doing his\nutmost to persuade his guest to revoke his decision as to the creation\nof the aerial warships. Franklin Marmion's simple announcement, which he\nnever thought for a moment of disbelieving, had filled his mind with new\nideas, which were rapidly taking the shape of gorgeous dreams of an\nempire such as mortal man had never ruled over before. All his present\ndesigns faded away into mere trivialities in comparison with this\nsplendid conception. He pictured Nitocris, as his consort, Empress of\nthe air, and himself Lord of earth and sea and sky. But all his subtle\narguments, all his delicately-put suggestions, and his skilfully framed\npromises failed to produce the slightest effect upon the genially\ninflexible man, who quietly turned them all aside, as a grown man might\ndeal with the arguments of a boy.\n\nThe thought that this man who was lying back in his deep-seated\narmchair, holding a cigar in a white, delicately-shaped hand which was\nstrong enough to shake the world to its foundations, should possess\nsuch a tremendous power and yet refuse to use it, as quietly as he might\nhave declined an invitation to dinner, exasperated him almost beyond the\nbounds of patience. If he would only join forces with him what glories\nmight they not achieve, what splendours of power and possession might\nnot be theirs! Here was universal empire, in one sense, only a couple of\nyards away from him! In another it was more distant than the suns which\nflame in Space beyond the Milky Way. It was maddening, but it was true,\nand he knew the man well enough now to feel absolutely assured that no\nextremity of mental or physical torment would wring the priceless secret\nfrom him.\n\nWell, if it had to be, it must be. If he could not learn the secret, at\nleast no one else should. Before morning it would be buried for ever\nunder the waters of the Baltic, and he would revenge himself on the\ndaughter for that which the father refused to do. If Franklin Marmion\nwould not give him the sceptre of the World-Empire, then Nitocris should\nbe his wife and Empress if she would, and if not, his slave and\nplaything, as he had sworn to Phadrig the Egyptian. The fortress-castle\nof Oscarburg, on the lonely wooded shore of Viborg Bay, had kept many a\nsecret safely before now, and it would keep this one. Every retainer in\nthe Castle, every man, woman, and child on the estates for leagues\naround, was his, body and soul, as their fathers before them had been\nthe blind, unquestioning serfs of his fathers. There his word was law,\nand his will was fate. There was no \"liberty\" within his domains, since\nno man wanted it, or would have understood it had it been given to him.\n\nWhen their argument was over they parted, apparently the best of\nfriends. Franklin Marmion went to bed calmly curious as to what was\ngoing to happen, and Oscarovitch paid a visit to his captain.\n\nA little after three that morning he opened the door of the Professor's\nstate-room very gently and looked in. The room was dark, and he\nlistened. A soft, just audible sound of breathing came from the bed. It\nwas the breathing of a man fast asleep. He pressed the spring of his\nelectric lamp, and turned the thin ray on to the water-bottle in the\nrack over the wash-stand. It was half-empty, and a glass stood on the\ntable in the middle of the room. Then the ray fell on the face of the\nsleeping man. It was as Prince Zastrow's face had been the last night he\nwent to sleep in the Castle of Trelitz--rather the face of a corpse than\nthat of a living man. His captain stood behind him, and he turned and\nwhispered:\n\n\"He is ready. Are the men below?\"\n\n\"All, Highness, save Grovno at the wheel and Hartog on the look-out.\nThey will see nothing, as they did before,\" came the whispered reply.\n\n\"Very well, then. You and I can manage this between us. You have the\nline?\"\n\nThe captain nodded, and they went into the room, softly closing the\ndoor. In a few minutes they came out again, carrying between them a long\nbundle of blankets lashed from end to end with thin line. They took it\naft along the alloway and out on to the lower deck by the stern. Two\niron doors of a port used for coaling stood open on the starboard side.\nOn the deck lay a couple of pigs of iron lashed together. These the\ncaptain made fast to one end of the bundle and lifted them towards the\nport. Oscarovitch took hold of the other end. They lifted it. The\nweights dropped outside the port, and the bundle followed them. The\ncaptain started up, clasped his hands to his forehead, and said in a\ngasping whisper:\n\n\"Holy God, Highness, what have we done?\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Derevskin? You have obeyed my orders; that is all. Is\nit not enough for you?\"\n\n\"Yes, Highness--but who or what was that man? Was he really a man?\"\n\n\"Are you mad, Derevskin?\"\n\n\"No, Highness, I hope not: but did you hear--or, rather, did you not\nhear?\"\n\n\"What, you fool?\"\n\n\"He--it--the body--it made no splash when it touched the water!\"\n\nThe stammered words struck Oscarovitch like so many puffs of frozen air.\nNo, the body of Franklin Marmion _had_ made no splash. It had vanished\nthrough the port into silence. That was all. He beat back his own terror\nwith the exertion of all his will-power, and said in a sneering\nwhisper:\n\n\"Derevskin, you are either mad or drunk; but I will forgive you this\ntime because you have obeyed. Go to bed, and don't forget to be either\nsober or sane when I come on deck.\"\n\nThe captain bowed his head, and went forward with shambling steps and\nshaking limbs. Oscarovitch closed the port with hands which all his\nforce could not keep steady, and betook himself to bed, to lie awake for\nthe rest of the short summer night wondering vainly what really had\nhappened.\n\nHe had had his bath and dressed soon after six, and went on deck. The\ncaptain was on the bridge, and he joined him.\n\n\"Good morning, Derevskin!\"\n\n\"I have the honour to wish Your Highness good morning!\"\n\n\"Nothing happened during the night worth reporting, I suppose?\"\n\n\"No, Highness, nothing.\"\n\n\"Very good: but I have slept badly, and you look as if you had been on\nthe bridge all night. Perhaps it is necessary among all these islands,\nand I am pleased that you are so watchful, especially as I have guests\non board. Come down to your room now and send your steward for a bottle.\nIt will do neither of us any harm.\"\n\nThere was a somewhat lengthy conversation over this early breakfast of\nchampagne and biscuits after the door had been closed and locked, and\nwhen it was finished, Oscarovitch and his captain understood each other\nas completely as was necessary.\n\nAn hour later he saw Nitocris walking about the upper deck looking pale\nand anxious. He went to her and said in a tone which intentionally\nbetrayed his own nervousness:\n\n\"Good morning, Miss Marmion! Have you seen anything of the Professor?\"\n\n\"No, Prince, I have not. I went to his room just now and knocked. There\nwas no reply and I opened the door. The room was empty, but he had\nevidently been to bed. Is he not on deck?\"\n\n\"No, Miss Marmion, he is not. He said last night that he would like his\nbath about six, and the steward I sent to valet him went to his room and\nfound it as you say. I have had the ship searched high and low, and from\nstem to stern, and there is no sign of him. I have had every one\nquestioned, and no one has seen anything of him since last night.\"\n\n\"Oh, my poor, poor Dad, I have lost him! Yes, I suppose it must have\nbeen that. He has walked overboard.\"\n\n\"Walked overboard, Miss Marmion?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, it must be that. Prince Oscarovitch, my father, like most\nvery clever men, had one dangerous failing. He walked in his sleep and\ndid things unconsciously. That was why he told you about the ghost at\n'The Wilderness' just as though he really had seen it. Yes, he must have\ngot up in the night and come on deck, and walked overboard, and so I\nhave lost the best friend I ever had, or shall have. You must excuse\nme, Prince. I must go to my room. The very sunlight seems horrible now.\nJenny will look after me. Good morning!\"\n\nHer face was white and her eyes were staring at nothing. She spoke with\na horrible, stony calm which, crime-hardened as he was, sent a thrilling\nshiver through his nerves. A spasm of remorse shook him; then his\nself-control came back, and he offered her his arm in silence. He led\nher down to the saloon, and gave her into Jenny's charge. Then he went\non deck again, lit a cigar, and proceeded to congratulate himself on the\ngreat good fortune which had, from his point of view at least, so\nhappily explained away the disappearance of Franklin Marmion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nTHE LUST THAT WAS--AND IS\n\n\nNitocris kept her room until nearly seven the following evening.\nOscarovitch made frequent enquiries of Jenny as to her condition, and\nalways received the same reply. Her mistress was in a semi-unconscious\nstate, and she could only rouse her every now and then to take a little\nnourishment. Unfortunately there was no doctor on board. He had had news\nin Copenhagen that his mother was lying very ill at Hamburg, and, as the\ncruise was then intended to be only a very short one, he had been given\nleave to go to her.\n\nThe Prince wished to go back to Copenhagen, but this Nitocris absolutely\nrefused. She had determined to fight her sorrow alone, and when she had\nconquered it, she would go back to England and her friends--which was\nexactly what Oscarovitch had determined she should not do. She was\nabsolutely at his mercy now. He would be something worse than a fool to\nlet such a golden opportunity go by--and so the _Grashna's_ bowsprit was\nkept pointing eastward, and the leagues between her and Oscarburg were\nbeing flung behind her as fast as the whirling screws could devour them.\n\nThe only question that he had to ask himself was: How? and to that an\neasy answer at once suggested itself: The Horus Stone.\n\nWhen he went down to what he expected would be a lonely dinner, he was\nmore than agreeably surprised to find Nitocris dressed in a black\nevening costume, which was the nearest approach to mourning that her\navailable wardrobe made possible, already in the saloon.\n\nHe bowed to her with a gesture of reverence, which meant far more than\nmere formal politeness, and said in a low tone:\n\n\"Miss Marmion, I need not say how pleased I am to find that you are able\nto leave your room. May I hope that you will be able to dine?\"\n\n\"Yes, Prince,\" she replied, in the same cold, mechanical voice in which\nshe had answered the tidings of her father's death. \"The worst is over\nnow, I hope. Some time and some way we must all leave the world and, at\nleast, there is the consolation that my father has left it perhaps a\nlittle better and a little wiser than he found it. That, I think is as\nmuch as the ordinary mortal may be permitted to hope for. We who hold\nthe Doctrine do not sorrow for the dead: we only sorrow for ourselves\nwho are left to wait until we may, perhaps, meet again.\"\n\n\"The Doctrine, Miss Marmion?\" he asked, as he placed a chair for her at\nhis right hand. \"May I ask what the Doctrine is?\"\n\n\"Of re-incarnation,\" she replied, sitting down and looking at him across\nthe corner of the table.\n\n\"Really? I most sincerely wish that I could believe in it. Mr Amena,\nwhom I took the great liberty of bringing to your garden-party, a man\nof very remarkable powers, as you saw, holds the Doctrine, as you call\nit, and he has been trying for months to convert me to it; but, as I\nsaid going to Elsinore, I'm afraid I am too hopelessly materialistic for\nany conversion to be possible in my case, at least as far as my present\nexperiences have gone.\"\n\n\"As the belief so must be the faith,\" she said with a grave smile. \"It\nis no more possible to have true faith when you do not really believe\nthan it is to be hungry when you have not got an appetite. That is quite\na material simile; but I think it is true.\"\n\n\"Absolutely true!\" he replied, looking at her again with a note of\ninterrogation in each eye. \"But, really, these things are too deep for\nme, a mere human animal. And now, talking about appetite, here comes the\nsoup.\"\n\nThe dinner _\u00e0 deux_ was just what he had intended it to be, simple and\nyet perfect in every detail. The subject of Franklin Marmion's departure\nfrom the world was, as if by mutual consent, dropped. Oscarovitch\ncomforted such conscience as he had by trying to believe that what\nNitocris had said about her belief in the Doctrine was to her really\ntrue. He also honestly believed that she had faced her great sorrow in\nsolitude, and overcome it in the strength of that belief. Their\nconversation turned easily away to other topics, and by the time that\ncoffee was brought in and he had obtained her permission to light a\ncigarette, his beautiful guest appeared to have left the recent past\nbehind her, for the time being at least, and was almost as she had been\nduring the run up to Elsinore.\n\nHer manner was that of complete composure, and it is hardly necessary to\nsay that this mastery of her emotion forced him to a degree of\nadmiration, almost of worship, which the physical charm that appealed\nonly to his animal senses could never have inspired. Here, truly, was\nthe ideal Empress of the Russias and the East sitting almost beside him.\nAnd now the psychological moment had come!\n\n\"Will you excuse me for a couple of minutes, Miss Marmion?\" he asked, as\nhe finished his coffee and rose from his chair. \"Going back to what you\nwere saying about re-incarnation: I have something in my room which I\nhope may interest you. I got it from my friend, the miracle-worker. He\ntold me a long story about it that I don't want to trouble you with: but\nthe thing in itself is quite worth seeing. At least, I never saw\nanything like it before.\"\n\n\"Then please let me see it,\" she replied, assenting with an inclination\nof her head. \"If that is so it must be, as you say, well worth seeing.\"\n\nHe went to his room and came back with a large square morocco case in\nhis hand. He gave it to her, and said:\n\n\"Do me the favour to open it, and tell me what you think of it.\"\n\nShe touched the spring and the cover flew up. She half-expected what she\nsaw. There, lying in a nest of soft black velvet, encircled by a triple\nhalo of whitely gleaming diamonds, was the Horus Stone. In an instant\nshe travelled back through fifty centuries to the scene of the\ndeath-bridal of her other self, Nitocris the Queen, in the\nbanqueting-hall of the Palace of Pepi. Then it had lain gleaming on her\nbreast, and now she saw it again with the eyes of flesh, after nearly\nfive thousand years. Now, too, she grasped in all the fullness of its\nevil meaning the reason why Oscarovitch had brought it to her in such an\nhour as this. With utter contempt in her soul and a smile on her lips,\nshe leaned back in her chair and said in a voice which had a note of\necstasy in it:\n\n\"Oh, Prince, how lovely! What a glorious gem! The diamonds are, of\ncourse, splendid, but they are only a setting for the emerald. What a\nmagnificent stone! Rich as you are, you are very fortunate to be the\npossessor of such a treasure--for treasure it surely must be.\"\n\n\"It is, as you say, a magnificent stone,\" he replied, looking steadily\ninto her questioning eyes. \"But if what Amena told me was true, it is\nsomething more than a unique gem. There is an inscription on it, some\ncharacters carved in the stone which are, as he said, the history of it,\nbut to me they are as unintelligible as the Assyrian cuneiform would be.\nPossibly you may know something of them. If you do, here is a lens that\nwill help your sight.\"\n\nShe took the glass from him and bent down over the gem. She read the\nsacred symbol of the Trinity as she had read it and known it ages\nbefore. But while she was gazing at it, she also read the intent of the\nman who had given it into her hands. She put the lens aside, and,\nlaying her palms on her temples, she looked deep down into the luminous\ndepths of the great emerald in a silence which Oscarovitch interpreted\ninto such meaning as he was able to make for himself.\n\nMinute after minute passed in silence, and still her eyes were fixed\nupon the Stone. Her face became like that of a beautiful masterpiece of\nPhidias: pure, cold, and true. A feeling of something like awe crept\nover him as he watched her, and he found himself asking whether, after\nall, Phadrig's story might have been true. But, true or not, there was\nthe fascination which, as Phadrig had told him, had lured Isaac Josephus\nto his self-inflicted doom. Her eyes were chained to the gem: her face\nwas no longer that of a living woman dominated by her own will. After\nall his disbelief, there _was_ an enchantment in the Stone, for here,\neven she, Nitocris, had succumbed to it.\n\nHe sat and waited for a few minutes longer. If there is magic in the\nStone, let it work, he thought; and so he sat and watched her until he\nsaw that the fixed stare of her eyes and the rigidity of her now\nperfectly statuesque face convinced him that the magic of the Stone had,\nas Phadrig had told him, made him the possessor of it, absolute master\nof the man or woman who had gazed upon its fatal beauty.\n\nThen he got up and, reaching over her shoulders, took up the diamond\nchain, glistening under the soft light of the starry dome of the saloon,\nshook it out into a flood of white radiance, lifted it above her head,\nand let it fall very gently round her neck. The Horus Stone, as though\nendowed with sentience, fell and rested where it had rested five\nthousand years before. As it touched her flesh Nitocris felt a tremor of\nindescribable emotion, not only of the body but of the soul, pass\nthrough her. She leaned back in her chair again, and whispered:\n\n\"Is it really mine now, Prince? But no! How could I take it from you--I\nwho can give nothing in exchange for such a treasure? No, no, you must\ntake it back. I am not worthy to wear it.\"\n\nHe laid his hands gently on her arms, and said in a soft, murmuring tone\nwhich sounded like the purring of a tiger-cat:\n\n\"Nitocris, if all the choicest gems in all the world could be put into a\ncrucible and fused into one, all its splendour would still be unworthy\nto lie on that white breast of yours. Give me your love, Nitocris. I am\nhungering and thirsting for it. Come with me to Oscarburg, and you shall\nbe crowned Princess--and after that Empress--Empress of the Russias and\nthe East. I will give you a dominion such as the great Catherine never\ndared to dream of. Say yes, and in a month you shall be seated on her\nthrone. It is only a little word, dearest, only a little word--will you\nnot say it, and be my Princess, my Queen, my Empress?\"\n\n\"I am tired now, Oscar,\" she said wearily, \"so much has happened in so\nshort a time. Yes, I will, if it is possible: but let me go now. No, you\nmust not kiss me yet. Remember that Russian saying, 'Take thy thoughts\nto bed with thee, for the morning is wiser than the evening.'\nGood-night, Oscar, I am very tired. You shall have your answer in the\nmorning. May I take this with me?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he replied, giving her his hand as she rose from her chair, and\nbowing over hers until his lips touched it. \"Take it, unworthy as it is,\nas an earnest of the realisation of the happy dreams that will come to\nme to-night. Au revoir, pas adieu!\"\n\n\"Auf viedersehn, mein Oscar!\" she replied as she passed him, leaving the\nsensation of a gentle flutter of her hand in his. \"We shall understand\neach other better still before long--I hope.\"\n\n\"It is my dearest wish. Good-night, Nitocris, and when the dawn comes\nmay it find nothing but sunshine in that sweet soul of yours!\"\n\nNitocris went to her room and found her maid waiting, white-faced and\nanxious. She was frightened and nearly worn out with caring for her\nmistress. She would have been very glad to have been back that very\nnight at \"The Wilderness,\" even if it had lost its master.\n\n\"Go to bed at once, Jenny; you look like a ghost, as you may well do\nafter all the trouble I've given you. No, I don't really want you, and\nyou want sleep rather badly. Go to bed, like a good girl. It will not be\nthe first time that I have undressed myself.\"\n\nAnd when Jenny had gone and she had locked the door, Nitocris stripped\nherself, save for the collar of diamonds and the pendant Horus Stone.\nShe took a long veil of Indian muslin out of her dress-box and wound it\nround her after the fashion of old Egypt, leaving her left breast bare.\nOnly the Ureaus Crown was wanting to make her, in the flesh, Nitocris\nthe Queen: but here on her bosom flashed and flamed the Horus\nStone--hers once again, as it had been in the far-off past, symbol of\nher sovereignty, and proof of her faith in the one true Doctrine.\n\nShe looked at the lovely reflection in the long mirror behind her\ndressing-table, and said to herself in a low, whispering laugh:\n\n\"This for you, Oscar Oscarovitch that is, Menkau-Ra who was! Yes, you\nmay dream your pleasant dreams to-night; you may take me to your lonely\ncastle in Viborg Bay; you may make me marry you, as you think I\nshall--and here is my wedding gift--mine again after all these\nages--blessed be for ever the Holy Trinity, Osiris, Isis, and Horus. May\nthe Most High Gods help and protect me!\"\n\nShe raised the Sacred Stone to her lips as she spoke, turned off the\nlight, and lay down in her bed to dream dreams of forgotten ages.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nTHE PASSING OF PHADRIG\n\n\nIn all London, or, indeed, in any capital of Europe, there were no more\nangrily puzzled men than Nicol Hendry and his colleague and\nsubordinates. He was perfectly certain now that Phadrig Amena held the\nkey to the conspiracy which had resulted in the disappearance of Prince\nZastrow. Oscarovitch had vanished. He had been traced to Copenhagen, and\nthen absolutely lost sight of. Three agents, all picked experts, had\nbeen put on to watch Phadrig and the Pentanas, as they were known to\nhim, and within a fortnight they had all died. One had fallen down\ncrossing the north side of Trafalgar Square: the verdict had been heart\nfailure. Another threw himself into the river from the Tower Bridge; and\nthe third, a woman who was one of the most skilful spies in the service\nof the International, had made his acquaintance and had dinner with him\nat the \"Monico,\" and was found dead the next morning with an empty\nmorphia syringe in her hand and a swollen puncture in her left arm.\n\nThus four more or less valuable lives had been lost, and not a shred of\ntangible evidence obtained against the Egyptian. Convinced as he was\nthat this man was as responsible for their deaths as he had been for\nthat of Josephus, neither he nor his colleagues could find the slightest\ngrounds for applying for a warrant for his arrest, and meanwhile things\nwere going from bad to worse in Russia. The Romanoff dynasty was\ntottering to its fall. The responsible leaders of the Revolution, angry\nand bewildered by the loss of the man whom they had practically chosen\nto rule over them, were distributing thousands of copies of an unsigned\nmanifesto which could not have come from any one but \"the new\nSkobeleff.\" What was left of the army and the navy was rallying to the\nnameless standard of the still unknown saviour of Russia. Von Kessner\nand Captain Vollmar had apparently ceased to exist, and the Princess\nHermia was living with her lady-in-waiting in the strictest retirement\nin Dresden.\n\n\"It seems to me that things are at an utter deadlock,\" said Nicol Hendry\nto the Chief of the German section, who had come over to London to\nconfer with him. \"Four of our best agents have died in a fortnight, and\nthe others are getting shy. Really, we can't blame them. This is not\nlike fighting the ordinary sort of anarchist or regicide, who, after\nall, does content himself with physical means. This infernal scoundrel,\nas I must confess I was warned to begin with, is quite independent of\nthe rules of the game. He kills people by their own hands, not his, and,\nliterally, there seems no way of catching him.\"\n\n\"There must be a way, my dear Hendry,\" replied the German, who was the\nvery incarnation of mechanical officialism. \"You look at these things as\nconsequences, I regard them only as rather extraordinary coincidences.\nIf this is anything like what you seem to think it, it is supernatural,\nand I don't believe in that.\"\n\n\"There is a very easy way to convince yourself, my dear Von Hamner,\"\nreplied Hendry, with a slight shrug of his shoulders. \"Suppose you go\nand interview this modern Mephistopheles yourself?\"\n\n\"Will you come with me if I do?\" asked the German, with a straight stare\nthrough his spectacles.\n\n\"Certainly. In our profession it is necessary to take risks. The thing\nhas gone far enough. Here we are in my room at New Scotland Yard, the\ncentre and stronghold of the British police system, and there is this\nman or super-man, if you like, making no sign, doing nothing that will\ngive us a hold upon him, and yet killing our agents as fast as we send\nthem to find out what he is working at, and we know just as much to-day\nas we did three weeks ago. Now, what is your idea?\"\n\n\"Just this: if the English law won't touch him, do as we do in Germany,\ntake the law into your own hands. We know where the fellow is to be\nfound down in that slum near the Borough Road. Send a few of your\nplain-clothes men there this afternoon, and we will follow in a cab.\nBring your bracelets with you, and I shall take my revolver. We don't\nwant any nonsense this time. If it goes on much longer we shall be the\nlaughing-stock of the whole force from end to end of Europe, and that\nwill not do us any good. Shall it be for this afternoon?\"\n\n\"It will be better done now. He has worked mischief enough, and if we\nare going to do it we may as well bring the thing to a head at once, as\nthey say in the States. Now I will give the instructions, and we will go\nto lunch. It may be the last that either of us will eat, you know.\"\n\n\"Poof!\" exclaimed Von Hamner, who was feeling not a little nettled at\nthis quiet challenge to test his personal courage. \"You are the last man\non earth that I should have suspected of superstition, my dear Hendry.\nBut, there, give your orders, and we will go to lunch, and then about\nfour o'clock we may make our call in Candler's Court.\"\n\nWhile the two Chiefs of the International were talking, Phadrig was\nreading a cypher telegram, of which the meaning was this:\n\n     \"REVAL.--Professor fell overboard three days ago. Body not\n     recovered. Horus Stone did its work. N. consents. I marry her at\n     Oscarburg. Russia ready. Fool International for a few days and come\n     to Viborg when you have done with them.\n                                                                   O.\"\n\n\"That is good news,\" said Phadrig, in a confidential whisper to himself;\n\"for a man on the lower plane of existence the Prince is wonderfully\nclever. This is a master-stroke. If he really has the Queen in his power\nall the rest will be easy.\"\n\n\"There's two gentlemen to see you, Mr Amena.\" The door opened, and his\nlandlady's dirty little daughter put her towsled head through the little\nspace behind the doorpost. \"They're down below; shall I send 'em up?\"\n\n\"Certainly, Jane. Tell the gentlemen that I shall be pleased to see\nthem.\"\n\nThe dirty face vanished as the door closed. Phadrig shut down the top of\nthe big escritoire and locked it. Heavy treads sounded on the rickety\nstairs. There was a shuffle of feet on the little landing, a sharp knock\nat the door, and he said in a low tone:\n\n\"Come in, gentlemen. I have been expecting you.\"\n\nThe door opened and Nicol Hendry entered, followed by his German\ncolleague. Practised as they were in all the arts of their profession,\nthey looked about the mean, miserably appointed room with curious eyes.\nPhadrig, dressed in the same shabby semi-Oriental costume in which he\nhad received Isaac Josephus, salaamed, and said:\n\n\"Gentlemen, although this is but a poor room to receive you in, I am\npleased that you have come. You are officers of the International, if I\nam not mistaken.\"\n\nThen his speech changed to German, and he went on:\n\n\"You, sir, are M. Nicol Hendry, and your friend is the Herr von Hamner,\nChief of the Berlin Section. What can I do to serve you?\"\n\nIt was anything but the greeting that they expected. They thought that\nthey had tracked the real criminal to his last hiding-place. They had\nestablished the identity between Phadrig, the poor seller of curios, and\nPhadrig Amena, the worker of miracles, whom all the smart set in London\nwas talking about; and here he was in this miserable, shabby room,\ndressed in clothes that no pawnbroker would advance a couple of\nshillings on, smiling and bowing before them as though they were lords\nof the earth, and he--the man who had sent three men and a woman to\ntheir deaths by, as it were, a mere word of command--a worm beneath\ntheir feet. Nicol Hendry managed to keep his self-possession, but Von\nHamner was already sorry that he had come, and his face showed it.\n\n\"We have come to ask you, Mr Amena,\" said Hendry, thinking it best to\ncome to the point at once, \"why you found it necessary to kill those\npeople. I needn't mention names. You know them as well as we do.\"\n\n\"I did not kill them, gentlemen. They killed themselves, according to\nthe newspaper reports. And now, may I ask you why you found it necessary\nto set these spies of yours to watch my every movement night and day?\nWhat have I done to bring myself within the four corners of your English\nlaw?\"\n\n\"Nothing, unfortunately, that we can get a warrant for,\" replied Hendry,\ntrying not to look into his eyes, \"and so we have taken the law into our\nown hands. Come, Mr Amena, the game is up. We know all about your share\nin the conspiracy to remove Prince Zastrow in order to make room for\nyour patron Prince Oscarovitch. We have copies of his manifesto at\nScotland Yard, and we know that you received a telegram in cypher from\nhim to-day.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Phadrig, in a tone whose smoothness was intensely\naggravating, \"that is very interesting. May I ask if you have translated\nthe cypher?\"\n\n\"No, damn you and your Prince!\" burst in Von Hamner. \"If we had done\nthat we should know even more about you than we do now--and that ought\nto be enough to hang you.\"\n\nHe had spluttered the words out before Hendry had time to stop him. He\nexpected a tragedy there and then, but it did not happen. Phadrig took\nthe telegram out of his coat pocket, handed it to Von Hamner with a\ngraceful bow, and said:\n\n\"Your information is quite correct, gentlemen. That is the telegram, and\nthis is the meaning of it.\"\n\nThen as they read the unintelligible jumble of words, he repeated the\nmeaning of them as though they formed the most ordinary message, instead\nof a dispatch that might, as they well knew, shake Europe to its social\nand political foundations within the next week or so.\n\n\"Then this is another of your devilries, I suppose,\" snarled Von Hamner.\n\"So you have killed the great Professor Marmion, the most gifted genius\nin the whole world, as you killed the others, to promote your infernal\nschemes; and you have helped that scoundrel Oscarovitch to abduct his\ndaughter. Well, law or no law, this shall be the end of your doings. You\nwill come with us as our prisoner, or you will not leave this room\nalive.\"\n\n\"Those are hard words, mein Herr,\" said Phadrig, still speaking in\nGerman. \"I your prisoner! Why? What have I done to make this outrage on\nEnglish law possible?\"\n\n\"You will do better to come, Mr Amena,\" said Hendry, in his quiet\nofficial tone; \"it will save a good deal of trouble both to you and us.\nIt must be the same in the end, you know. We have got you, and we don't\nmean to let you do any more mischief. You have done quite enough\nalready. Now, will you come quietly, or shall we take you? We shall\ncharge you at Lambeth as a receiver of stolen goods: you will be\nremanded for a week in custody, and by that time we shall have your\nPrince in safe keeping in St Petersburg.\"\n\n\"Will you, really?\" asked Phadrig, lifting his eyelids for the first\ntime during the interview. \"I should have thought that a man of your\nEuropean experience would have called the Russian capital by its proper\nname. Surely you know that only newspaper people make that mistake. It\nis the city of Peter the Great, not Saint Peter the apostle. The\nfortress of Petro-paulovsky is not named after saints--only after\nTsars.\"\n\nThere was a sneer in his voice as he made this trivial correction which\nroused both Hendry and Von Hamner to anger. The German pulled his\nrevolver out of his hip pocket, and Hendry produced a beautiful pair of\npolished handcuffs from his left trouser pocket.\n\n\"Ah, I see that you have come prepared, gentlemen!\" said Phadrig, with a\nlaughing sneer in his low-voiced whisper. \"Those are what you call the\nbracelets in England, are they not? Well, since you are determined to\ntake the law into your hands--here are mine. Put them on M. Hendry, and\nthen your friend may not think it necessary to try and shoot me.\"\n\nHe held his hands out. The way in which he said \"try and shoot me\" did\nnot sound well in their ears, but Nicol Hendry thought that the work had\nto be put through now or not at all. He took a couple of steps towards\nPhadrig, and a couple of sharp snaps told Von Hamner that their prisoner\nwas safe. But the prisoner did not seem to think so. He raised his hands\nand looked at the handcuffs. He seemed to examine them as though they\nwere curiosities.\n\n\"Are these really what you take criminals to prison with? They don't\nseem very strong. I could break them as though they were thread.\"\n\n\"That will do, Mr Amena. You've got them on now, and we don't want any\nmore of your conjuring tricks. Come along, and take it quietly like a\nsensible man.\"\n\nHendry was fast losing patience, and Von Hamner was doing all he could\nto keep his finger off the trigger of the revolver.\n\n\"Ah yes, conjuring tricks you call them, you ignorants! Now look. You\nhave put the handcuffs on to my wrists. Is this a conjuring trick? See!\"\n\nHe held his arms out towards them, his two hands chained together.\n\n\"Mr Hendry, be good enough to take my right hand, and you, Herr von\nHamner, my left. So; now shake my hands. You see, there are the\nhandcuffs on the floor.\"\n\nIt was only a shake of the hands, but the clink of the steel followed as\nthe bracelets dropped from his wrists. He stooped down, and inside ten\nseconds they were clipped round Von Hamner's. In the same instant he had\ntwitched the revolver out of his hand and pointed it at Hendry's face.\n\n\"Now, gentlemen, you were talking about taking the law into your own\nhands. I, you see, have taken it into mine. What do you propose to do? I\nam quite at your service. Your idea of arresting me on a charge of\nreceiving stolen goods is, if you will allow me to say so, absurd. You\ncould no more make me guilty of that than you could hang me for the\ndeaths of those foolish spies of yours. Now, what is it to be? Pardon\nme, Herr von Hamner: the bracelets inconvenience you. Allow me.\" He took\nthe handcuffs between his finger and thumb, shook the chain, and they\ndropped into his hand. \"You will feel more comfortable now.\"\n\n\"Yes, and I'll make you less comfortable in Hell, where you should have\nbeen long ago,\" shouted Von Hamner, jumping at him the moment his hands\nwere free, and snatching the revolver out of his hand. The pistol went\nup before Hendry could get hold of his arm, and he fired. Phadrig put\nhis hand up, and when the smoke had drifted away, he held it out to Von\nHamner, and said:\n\n\"I think that is your bullet, mein Herr.\"\n\nThe bullet was lying in the palm of his hand, a little out of shape\nthrough passing the rifling, but still the same bullet.\n\nThe German's face turned a reddish-grey, and Nicol Hendry, with all his\ncourage, was not feeling particularly well. As a matter of fact, he was,\nfor the first time in his life, absolutely frightened. A man who could\ndeal with handcuffs as though they were made of cotton, and catch a\nbullet in his hands, was not the sort of criminal he had been trained to\nhunt. As for Von Hamner, he was in a state of utter collapse. He dropped\nupon a chair, a pitiable spectacle of craven fear, looking about half\nhis real size so physically shrunken did he seem.\n\n\"Let the devil go, Hendry,\" he mumbled. \"He is more than man. What is\nthe use? If you cannot shoot him, you cannot hang him, and if handcuffs\nwon't hold him, prison doors won't. Let us go and leave the devil to\nhimself. I've had enough of it.\"\n\n\"But perhaps the devil has not,\" said Phadrig, with a politeness which\nwas infuriating in its mildness. \"You gentlemen will understand that I\ndo not wish to have this espionage going on any longer. If you cannot\npromise that it shall stop at once I shall, for my own protection, have\nto suggest to you that you shall remove yourselves, as the others have\ndone.\"\n\n\"No, no, not that, man, not that!\" shouted Von Hamner, springing from\nhis seat and making for the door. \"I have done with the whole business,\ncurse it! Let me go, let me go! Hendry, do as you like, but do it alone.\nI have finished.\"\n\nBefore Hendry could reply, or before Von Hamner could reach it, the door\nwas flung open, and Franklin Marmion strode into the room. Von Hamner\ncrawled back to his chair. He did not like the look of a dead man who\nhad come to life again. Nicol Hendry held out his hand, and said:\n\n\"And is it really you, Professor? Mr Amena here has just had news that\nyou were dead--'fallen overboard in the Baltic from Prince Oscarovitch's\nyacht. Body not recovered,' is what the telegram says.\"\n\n\"The body is here right enough, M. Hendry. I did not fall overboard. I\nwas bound hand and foot, had a mass of iron tied to my feet, and was\nthrown out of a port-hole by the Prince and his captain. Of course, I\ngot rid of the rope and the iron even more easily than this man got rid\nof your handcuffs a short time ago, and after keeping myself afloat for\nhalf an hour or so, I was picked up by a fishing-boat which took me to\nStralsund. I got a change of clothes there, and came home _vi\u00e2_ Hamburg\nand Ostend. My daughter has gone on in the yacht to Oscarburg, where\nthe Prince expects to make her his wife, and where she will make a very\nconsiderable fool of him. That is all, and now I suppose I had better\ndeal with this man.\"\n\n\"Mercy, mercy, Thou Who Knowest! Pity, pity!\"\n\nPhadrig raised his hands above his head, turned round thrice slowly, and\nsank in a heap on the floor.\n\n\"Thou who wast once High Priest in the House of Ptah: thou who hast held\nthe Doctrine: thou darest to ask for mercy, knowing well that there is\nno forgiveness of sins: thou hast taken innocent lives, believing\nthyself above human law. A wasted life is behind thee: see that thou\ndoest better for thy soul's sake in the next. Die now! The High Gods\nhave spoken, and the penalty of sin is death--and the life beyond. Die!\"\n\nAnd Phadrig died. His eyes glazed and his flesh withered; his lips and\nhis gums dried up and shrivelled away from his jaws. His clothes fell\naway from his body in rotting shreds, and before Nicol Hendry and Von\nHamner had quite grasped the full meaning of the horror that was\nhappening before their eyes, all that was left of him was a little heap\nof yellow bones with a few fragments of cloth clinging to them.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Franklin Marmion, \"there are some things which cannot\nbe told. I think you will agree with me that this is one of them. Mr\nAmena has left the world for the present. Those bones will be dust in a\nfew minutes. It will only be another mysterious disappearance, and I\ndon't think that any one except the Pentanas and Prince Oscarovitch will\ntrouble much about him. The Pentanas are now deprived of all power for\nharm, and the Prince will probably be a harmless lunatic when he comes\nback into the world. I should sweep that dust up and put it into the\nfireplace, if I were you. In that desk you will find documents giving\nthe whole history of the Affaire Zastrow. They will be useful to you.\nYou will have to excuse me now. Europe is on the brink of war, and I\nmust go and remove the cause. I rely upon your discretion as to the\nevents of this afternoon. Au revoir. I shall have the pleasure of seeing\nyou again shortly.\"\n\nThe door closed, and they were left to their somewhat gruesome task.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nCAPTAIN MERRILL'S COMMISSION\n\n\nFranklin Marmion found a hansom in the Borough Road and drove to\nWaterloo. He had just time to wire to Merrill to meet him at the\n\"Keppel's Head\" for dinner and catch the new 4.55 express for\nPortsmouth. Merrill was waiting for him in the smoking-room. As they\nshook hands, he said in the quiet tone which is characteristic of his\nprofession:\n\n\"Your wire was rather sudden news, Professor. I thought you were\nsomewhere in the Baltic. Your coming back like this seemed to mean\nsomething, and so I took the liberty of having a private room for our\ndinner.\"\n\n\"Perfectly right, my dear Merrill,\" he replied. \"Let us go upstairs at\nonce. I have a good deal to say to you, and what I am going to say will\nhave to be done quickly.\"\n\n\"We have our sailing orders for the Baltic, and the Special Squadron\nleaves Spithead at midnight. Come upstairs, Professor, and we can talk.\"\n\nDinner was served a few minutes after they got into the room that\nMerrill had reserved on the first floor. The waiter was dismissed and\nthe door locked, and then Franklin Marmion told Mark Merrill the most\nwonderful story he had ever heard. If it had come from any one else he\nwould have put it down as a lie, but he remembered what had happened in\nthe lecture theatre of the Royal Society, and so he held his peace. It\nwas quite impossible for him to disbelieve anything the father of his\nBest Beloved told him. When the Professor had finished the story of\nNitocris and the Prince, he leaned his elbows on the table, and said:\n\n\"Now, my dear Merrill, I am going to put it into your power to save\nEurope from the horrors of a universal war: but to that you must be\nprepared to take risks which may result in your being dismissed the\nService. On the other hand, if you succeed, as you are almost certain to\ndo if you act strictly on the instructions that I am going to give you,\nyou will be a Captain in a month, and a Vice-Admiral in a year.\"\n\n\"But I'm a Captain now, Professor. I was keeping that little bit of news\nfor you. I hoisted my pennant this morning on His Majesty's ship\n_Nitocris_: new second-class cruiser, eight thousand tons, and\ntwenty-four knots: as pretty a ship as Elswick ever turned out. And the\nname: it came to me like a revelation.\"\n\n\"Possibly it was, in a sense that you may not quite understand now, but\nyou will understand it when you and Niti are married. She will be better\nable to explain it then than I could now.\"\n\n\"And what are the orders--I mean, of course, the private ones? Ours are:\nsail at midnight, make Kronstadt in forty-eight hours: command the\napproaches to Riga and St Petersburg, and wait for the developments of\nthis manifesto which seems to be setting what is left of Russia on fire.\nGermany is in with us for the time being: France and Italy and our\nMediterranean squadron will see to things in the Near East, and\naltogether there seem to be the prospects of a very handsome sort of\nrow.\"\n\n\"Which you, my dear Merrill, will be the means of preventing,\" said\nFranklin Marmion, taking a piece of folded tracing paper out of the\ninside pocket of his coat. \"I yield to circumstance. The name of your\nnew ship convinces me that I was wrong in certain other circumstances.\nYou will give me a passage to Viborg on the _Nitocris_. You will take\nFrench leave of the fleet as soon as you sight Kronstadt, get into\nViborg Bay at your best speed, land your men, take the Castle, which is\nquite undefended, bring away Prince Zastrow and Oscarovitch, and, of\ncourse, Niti; put your two princes on board the flagship, bring them\nback to England, and dictate terms from London. It seems a good deal to\ndo, but I will make it possible, if you are prepared to do as I advise\nyou. There is the chart showing the approaches to Oscarburg.\"\n\n\"I'll do it, sir,\" said Merrill, taking the tracing from his hand. \"I'll\nbreak every regulation of the Service into little pieces to get that\ndone. Now, I ought to be getting on board. Are you ready?\"\n\n\"Quite,\" said Franklin Marmion, rising from his chair. \"I see now where\nthe man of action comes in. I did not see that before, I must confess.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nTHE BRIDAL OF OSCAROVITCH\n\n\nThe Special Service Squadron steamed out of Spithead as the clock of\nPortsmouth Town Hall chimed twelve that night. Thirty-six hours later a\nmarriage ceremony took place in the chapel of the Castle of Oscarburg.\nIt was performed according to the rites of the Orthodox Church, and the\nwitnesses were Prince Zastrow and his medical attendant, Doctor Hugo.\nThe retainers of the Castle, headed by the major-domo and the\nhousekeeper, formed the congregation. Jenny was up in her mistress' room\npacking as though for an immediate departure. She was very frightened at\nthe happenings of the past three or four days, but she contented herself\nwith the thought that her mistress was going to be a princess, and that,\ntherefore, her own lot in life would be brightened with reflected glory.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the wedding feast was held in the great\ndining-hall of the Castle after the ancient Finnish style. When the\nloving-cup had been drunk, Nitocris took leave of her lord and went to\nher room. The bridal chamber was blazing with light, and the great\nsilken-hung bed was a couch fit for a queen. She turned the draperies\ndown, laid herself dressed on the thick, downy bed, and then got up and\nwent back to her own.\n\n\"I shall sleep here to-night, Jenny, and I shall not undress. You\nmustn't do, either. Lock the door, and put the sofa across it. You will\nfind that something is going to happen to-night. Is everything ready for\nus to go away?\"\n\n\"Yes, Your Highness,\" replied Jenny, wondering what was going to happen\nnext.\n\n\"You must not call me Highness, Jenny,\" said her mistress, with a laugh.\n\"I did not marry the Prince to-day. It was some one else he knew a long\ntime ago. I have put her to bed in that splendid bridal chamber of his.\nShe is waiting for him now.\"\n\n\"But I don't understand, Miss--I----\"\n\n\"There is no need for you to understand, Jenny. Just be a good girl, and\ndo as you're told. When we get back to England I will explain matters as\nfar as I can.\"\n\nMiss Jenny wisely decided to keep her thoughts to herself, and went on\nwith her packing. Nitocris changed her bridal dress for her yachting\ncostume, and lay down on the couch to await the progress of events.\n\nOscarovitch left the company in the dining-hall to their revel in about\nan hour's time, and went up to his fate in the bridal chamber. He\nknocked and opened the door softly: locked it, and went toward the bed.\nHe leaned over it for a moment, and then a hoarse shriek of mingled rage\nand terror rang through the room. He flung the clothes off the bed.\nWhere was the lovely bride he had wedded only a few hours before? What\nwas this horrible thing lying where _she_ should have been? Not\nNitocris--and yet, it _was_ Nitocris. Like a flash of lightning rending\nthe darkness of the midnight heavens, the gap of oblivion between his\nlives was rent, and the light flamed into his soul. Phadrig had lied to\nhim. The daughter of Rameses had not died that night in the banqueting\nchamber of the Palace of Pepi. She had lived and reigned virgin queen of\nthe Sacred Land. Her body had been submitted to the hands of the\nparaschites and buried in the City of the Dead over against Memphis, on\nthe eastward side of the river. And here was her mummy lying in his\nbridal bed, mocking him with its hideous, stony rigidity.\n\nFor a few terrible moments he stood staring at it, his clenched fists\nraised above his head. Then with another scream he cast himself upon it.\n\nWhen they broke the door open, they found the man who in a few days\nwould have been Emperor of the Russias and the East lying across the bed\nmowing and gibbering like a mad monkey, and scraping up handfuls of\nbrown dust from the stained sheets.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwenty-four hours later the Admiral in command of the British Special\nSquadron off Kronstadt saw the private signal flashed from the\nnorth-east. He was a very angry Admiral, for he had lost a brand-new\ncruiser and one of the smartest captains in the Service. But the signal\nspelt \"_Nitocris_. All well. Coming alongside.\"\n\n\"All well, and be damned to you, Captain Merrill!\" muttered the Admiral\nunder his breath, when the signal was read to him. \"This is a nice way\nto begin a new command. I've half a mind to put him under arrest: but\nhe's a good man. I'd better hear what he has to say for himself first. I\nwonder what the deuce he's been doing with that cruiser since he took\nher away without leave? Well, here she is, I suppose.\"\n\nBut it was not H.M.S. _Nitocris_ that came out of the night glittering\nwith electric lights and flying through the water at a speed that the\nfastest destroyer in the squadron could not have equalled. A whistle\ntooted softly, a white shape swung up out of the darkness and slowed\ndown alongside the flagship. A boat dropped into the water, and three\nminutes later Captain Mark Merrill ran up the gangway ladder, saluted\nthe quarter-deck, and handed his sword to the Admiral.\n\n\"I have done wrong, sir, but I hope that I have also, in another sense,\ndone right. I have brought both princes with me.\"\n\n\"Both princes--Good Lord, sir, what do you mean?\"\n\n\"May I come below with you, sir, and explain? It has been rather\ndelicate work, but we've got it through all right, I think.\"\n\n\"Then keep your sword for the present, and come and tell me what you\nhave to say.\"\n\nCaptain Merrill followed the Admiral to his room, and told the story of\nthe taking of the Oscarburg--a very easy matter with a hundred\nbluejackets at his back--the capture of Oscarovitch, who was now in a\nstraight waistcoat on board his own yacht, the rescue of Prince Zastrow\nand Nitocris, and----\n\n\"The other Nitocris is following, sir,\" he concluded. \"I thought I had\nbetter take the yacht. She can make a good thirty-five knots, and that's\nuseful when you're in a hurry. And now, sir, I am at your disposal.\"\n\n\"Rubbish!\" said the Admiral, holding out his hand. \"Captain Merrill, I\ndon't quite know how you've done it, but you've saved Europe, and\nperhaps the world, from war. If you hadn't brought those two princes of\nyours to-night, we should have been fighting Germany for the possession\nof Kronstadt before mid-day to-morrow. Those were the orders. Now, of\ncourse, they can do nothing, as you have brought Prince Zastrow back\nfrom the dead. He's their choice, and you had better get him and the\nother away to London as soon as I have seen them, and you can take my\nreport with you on that thirty-five knotter after breakfast to-morrow\nmorning. Now, it's getting late. I'll say good-night.\"\n\n\n\n\nEPILOGUE\n\n\nThe double wedding which took place at St George's, Hanover Square, the\nfollowing June was one of the most brilliant functions of the year.\nTheir Majesties of Russia and Great Britain graced the ceremony with\ntheir presence, and, as a special act of grace to the man who, with\nFranklin Marmion's help, had saved the world from what might have been\none of the bloodiest wars in history, H.M.S. _Nitocris_ was put into\ncommission for a cruise, the object of which was anything rather than\nwarlike. Two of the happiest couples on land or sea made the round of\nthe world in her. Before they returned Princess Hermia had taken the\nlast of Phadrig's drug and lain down to sleep never to wake again, and\nin the fullness of her happiness Nitocris pardoned Oscar Oscarovitch,\nand allowed him to die.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n  Supernatural & Occult Fiction\n\n  An Arno Press Collection\n\n\n  Ainsworth, W[illiam] Harrison. ~Auriol~: Or, The Elixir of Life.\n  [c. 1892]\n\n  Arlen, Michael. ~Ghost Stories~.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
