The Patrol battle cruisers swerved to meet\nthem, and a miles-long cone of pure energy ravened out at the invaders,\ndestroying whatever it touched.\n\nBut the moment before the force beam struck, thousands of tiny objects\ndropped from the enemy fleet and, faster than light, flashed straight\nat their target--each one an atom bomb powerful enough to destroy\nPatrol Headquarters by itself!\n\nThe Galactic Patrol--and civilization itself--had seconds to live.\nUnless a miracle happened....\n\nA LENSMAN ADVENTURE\n\n_Second in the Great Series_\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\n\nThe visitor, making his way unobserved through the crowded main\nlaboratory of The Hill, stepped up to within six feet of the back\nof a big Norwegian seated at an electrono-optical bench. Drawing an\nautomatic pistol, he shot the apparently unsuspecting scientist seven\ntimes, as fast as he could pull the trigger; twice through the brain,\nfive times, closely spaced, through the spine.\n\n\"Ah, Gharlane of Eddore, I have been expecting you to look me up. Sit\ndown.\" Blonde, blue-eyed Dr. Nels Bergenholm, completely undisturbed by\nthe passage of the stream of bullets through his head and body, turned\nand waved one huge hand at a stool beside his own.\n\n\"But those were not ordinary projectiles!\" the visitor protested.\nNeither person--or rather, entity--was in the least surprised that no\none else had paid any attention to what had happened, but it was clear\nthat the one was taken aback by the failure of his murderous attack.\n\"They should have volatilized that form of flesh--should at least have\nblown you back to Arisia, where you belong.\"\n\n\"Ordinary or extraordinary, what matter? As you, in the guise of\nGray Roger, told Conway Costigan a short time since, 'I permitted\nthat, as a demonstration of futility.' Know, Gharlane, once and for\nall, that you will no longer be allowed to act directly against any\nadherent of Civilization, wherever situate. We of Arisia will not\ninterfere in person with your proposed conquest of the two galaxies\nas you have planned it, since the stresses and conflicts involved are\nnecessary--and, I may add, sufficient--to produce the Civilization\nwhich must and shall come into being. Therefore, neither will you, or\nany other Eddorian, so interfere. You will go back to Eddore and you\nwill stay there.\"\n\n\"Think you so?\" Gharlane sneered. \"You, who have been so afraid of us\nfor over two thousand million Tellurian years that you dared not let us\neven learn of you? So afraid of us that you dared not take any action\nto avert the destruction of any one of your budding Civilizations upon\nany one of the worlds of either galaxy? So afraid that you dare not,\neven now, meet me mind to mind, but insist upon the use of this slow\nand unsatisfactory oral communication between us?\"\n\n\"Either your thinking is loose, confused, and turbid, which I do not\nbelieve to be the case, or you are trying to lull me into believing\nthat you are stupid.\" Bergenholm's voice was calm, unmoved. \"I do not\n_think_ that you will go back to Eddore; I know it. You, too, as soon\nas you have become informed upon certain matters, will know it. You\nprotest against the use of spoken language because it is, as you know,\nthe easiest, simplest, and surest way of preventing you from securing\nany iota of the knowledge for which you are so desperately searching.\nAs to a meeting of our two minds, they met fully just before you,\noperating as Gray Roger, remembered that which your entire race forgot\nlong ago. As a consequence of that meeting I so learned every line\nand vibration of your life pattern as to be able to greet you by your\nsymbol, Gharlane of Eddore, whereas you know nothing of me save that I\nam an Arisian, a fact which has been obvious from the first.\"\n\nIn an attempt to create a diversion, Gharlane released the zone of\ncompulsion which he had been holding; but the Arisian took it over so\nsmoothly that no human being within range was conscious of any change.\n\n\"It is true that for many cycles of time we concealed our existence\nfrom you,\" Bergenholm went on without a break. \"Since the reason for\nthat concealment will still further confuse you, I will tell you what\nit was. Had you Eddorians learned of us sooner you might have been able\nto forge a weapon of power sufficient to prevent the accomplishment of\nan end which is now certain.\n\n\"It is true that your operations as Lo Sung of Uighar were not\nconstrained. As Mithridates of Pontus--as Sulla, Marius, and Nero of\nRome--as Hannibal of Carthage--as those self-effacing wights Alcixerxes\nof Greece and Menocoptes of Egypt--as Genghis Khan and Attila and\nthe Kaiser and Mussolini and Hitler and the Tyrant of Asia--you were\nallowed to do as you pleased. Similar activities upon Rigel Four,\nVelantia, Palain Seven, and elsewhere were also allowed to proceed\nwithout effective opposition. With the appearance of Virgil Samms,\nhowever, the time arrived to put an end to your customary pernicious,\nobstructive, and destructive activities. I therefore interposed a\nbarrier between you and those who would otherwise be completely\ndefenseless against you.\"\n\n\"But why now? Why not thousands of cycles ago? And why Virgil Samms?\"\n\n\"To answer those questions would be to give you valuable data. You\nmay--too late--be able to answer them yourself. But to continue: you\naccuse me, and all Arisia, of cowardice; an evidently muddy and inept\nthought. Reflect, please, upon the completeness of your failure in the\naffair of Roger's planetoid; upon the fact that you have accomplished\nnothing whatever since that time; upon the situation in which you now\nfind yourself.\n\n\"Even though the trend of thought of your race is basically\nmaterialistic and mechanistic, and you belittle ours as being\n'philosophic' and 'impractical', you found--much to your surprise--that\nyour most destructive physical agencies are not able to affect even\nthis form of flesh which I am now energizing, to say nothing of\naffecting the reality which is I.\n\n\"If this episode is the result of the customary thinking of the\nsecond-in-command of Eddore's Innermost Circle ... but no, my\nvisualization cannot be that badly at fault. Overconfidence--the\ntyrant's innate proclivity to underestimate an opponent--these things\nhave put you into a false position; but I greatly fear that they will\nnot operate to do so in any really important future affair.\"\n\n\"Rest assured that they will not!\" Gharlane snarled. \"It may not\nbe--exactly--cowardice. It is, however, something closely akin. If you\ncould have acted effectively against us at any time in the past, you\nwould have done so. If you could act effectively against us now, you\nwould be acting, not talking. That is elementary--self-evidently true.\nSo true that you have not tried to deny it--nor would you expect me to\nbelieve you if you did.\" Cold black eyes stared level into icy eyes of\nNorwegian blue.\n\n\"Deny it? No. I am glad, however, that you used the word 'effectively'\ninstead of 'openly'; for we have been acting effectively against you\never since these newly-formed planets cooled sufficiently to permit of\nthe development of intelligent life.\"\n\n\"What? You have? How?\"\n\n\"That, too, you may learn--too late. I have now said all I intend\nto say. I will give you no more information. Since you already know\nthat there are more adult Arisians than there are Eddorians, so that\nat least one of us can devote his full attention to blocking the\ndirect effort of any one of you, it is clear to you that it makes no\ndifference to me whether you elect to go or to stay. I can and I will\nremain here as long as you do; I can and I will accompany you whenever\nyou venture out of the volume of space protected by Eddorian screen,\nwherever you go. The election is yours.\"\n\nGharlane disappeared. So did the Arisian--instantaneously. Dr. Nels\nBergenholm, however, remained. Turning, he resumed his work where he\nhad left off, knowing exactly what he had been doing and exactly what\nhe was going to do to finish it. He released the zone of compulsion,\nwhich he had been holding upon every human being within sight or\nhearing, so dexterously that no one suspected, then or ever, that\nanything out of the ordinary had happened. He knew these things and\ndid these things in spite of the fact that the form of flesh which his\nfellows of the Triplanetary Service knew as Nels Bergenholm was then\nbeing energized, not by the stupendously powerful mind of Drounli the\nMolder, but by an Arisian child too young to be of any use in that\nwhich was about to occur.\n\nArisia was ready. Every Arisian mind capable of adult, or of even\nnear-adult thinking was poised to act when the moment of action should\ncome. They were not, however, tense. While not in any sense routine,\nthat which they were about to do had been foreseen for many cycles of\ntime. They knew exactly what they were going to do, and exactly how to\ndo it. They waited.\n\n\"My visualization is not entirely clear concerning the succession of\nevents stemming from the fact that the fusion of which Drounli is\na part did not destroy Gharlane of Eddore while he was energizing\nGray Roger,\" a young Watchman, Eukonidor by symbol, thought into the\nassembled mind. \"May I take a moment of this idle time in which to\nspread my visualization, for enlargement and instruction?\"\n\n\"You may, youth.\" The Elders of Arisia--the mightiest intellects of\nthat tremendously powerful race--fused their several minds into one\nmind and gave approval. \"That will be time well spent. Think on.\"\n\n\"Separated from the other Eddorians by inter-galactic distance as\nhe then was, Gharlane could have been isolated and could have been\ndestroyed,\" the youth pointed out, as he somewhat diffidently spread\nhis visualization in the public mind. \"Since it is axiomatic that his\ndestruction would have weakened Eddore somewhat and to that extent\nwould have helped us, it is evident that some greater advantage will\naccrue from allowing him to live. Some points are clear enough: that\nGharlane and his fellows will believe that the Arisian fusion could\nnot kill him, since it did not; that the Eddorians, contemptuous of our\npowers and thinking us vastly their inferiors, will not be driven to\ndevelop such things as atomic-energy-powered mechanical screens against\nthird-level thought until such a time as it will be too late for even\nthose devices to save their race from extinction; that they will, in\nall probability, never even suspect that the Galactic Patrol which is\nso soon to come into being will in fact be the prime operator in that\nextinction. It is not clear, however, in view of the above facts, why\nit has now become necessary for us to slay one Eddorian upon Eddore.\nNor can I formulate or visualize with any clarity the techniques\nto be employed in the final wiping out of the race; I lack certain\nfundamental data concerning events which occurred and conditions which\nobtained many, many cycles before my birth. I am unable to believe that\nmy perception and memory could have been so imperfect--can it be that\nnone of that basic data is, or ever has been available?\"\n\n\"That, youth, is the fact. While your visualization of the future is of\ncourse not as detailed nor as accurate as it will be after more cycles\nof labor, your background of knowledge is as complete as that of any\nother of our number.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Eukonidor gave the mental equivalent of a nod of complete\nunderstanding. \"It is necessary, and the death of a lesser Eddorian--a\nWatchman--will be sufficient. Nor will it be either surprising or\nalarming to Eddore's Innermost Circle that the integrated total mind of\nArisia should be able to kill such a relatively feeble entity. I see.\"\n\nThen silence; and waiting. Minutes? Or days? Or weeks? Who can tell?\nWhat does time mean to any Arisian?\n\nThen Drounli arrived; arrived in the instant of his leaving The\nHill--what matters even inter-galactic distance to the speed of\nthought? He fused his mind with those of the three other Molders\nof Civilization. The massed and united mind of Arisia, poised and\nready, awaiting only his coming, launched itself through space. That\ntremendous, that theretofore unknown concentration of mental force\narrived at Eddore's outer screen in practically the same instant as\ndid the entity that was Gharlane. The Eddorian, however, went through\nwithout opposition; the Arisians did not.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSome two thousand million years ago, when the Coalescence occurred--the\nevent which was to make each of the two interpassing galaxies teem with\nplanets--the Arisians were already an ancient race; so ancient that\nthey were even then independent of the chance formation of planets. The\nEddorians, it is believed, were older still. The Arisians were native\nto this, our normal space-time continuum; the Eddorians were not.\n\nEddore was--and is--huge, dense, and hot. Its atmosphere is not air,\nas we of small, green Terra, know air, but is a noxious mixture of\ngaseous substances known to mankind only in chemical laboratories.\nIts hydrosphere, while it does contain some water, is a poisonous,\nstinking, foully corrosive, slimy and sludgy liquid.\n\nAnd the Eddorians were as different from any people we know as Eddore\nis different from the planets indigenous to our space and time. They\nwere, to our senses, utterly monstrous; almost incomprehensible. They\nwere amorphous, amoeboid, sexless. Not androgynous or parthenogenetic,\nbut absolutely sexless; with a sexlessness unknown in any Earthly form\nof life higher than the yeasts. Thus they were, to all intents and\npurposes and except for death by violence, immortal; for each one,\nafter having lived for hundreds of thousands of Tellurian years and\nhaving reached its capacity to live and to learn, simply divided into\ntwo new individuals, each of which, in addition to possessing in full\nits parent's mind and memories and knowledges, had also a brand-new\nzest and a greatly increased capacity.\n\nAnd, since life was, there had been competition. Competition for power.\nKnowledge was worth while only insofar as it contributed to power.\nWarfare began, and aged, and continued; the appallingly efficient\nwarfare possible only to such entities as those. Their minds, already\nimmensely powerful, grew stronger and stronger under the stresses of\ninternecine struggle.\n\nBut peace was not even thought of. Strife continued, at higher and even\nhigher levels of violence, until two facts became apparent. First, that\nevery Eddorian who could be killed by physical violence had already\ndied; that the survivors had developed such tremendous powers of mind,\nsuch complete mastery of things physical as well as mental, that they\ncould not be slain by physical force. Second, that during the ages\nthrough which they had been devoting their every effort to mutual\nextermination, their sun had begun markedly to cool; that their planet\nwould very soon become so cold that it would be impossible for them\never again to live their normal physical lives.\n\nThus there came about an armistice. The Eddorians worked together--not\nwithout friction--in the development of mechanisms by the use of which\nthey moved their planet across light-years of space to a younger,\nhotter sun. Then, Eddore once more at its hot and reeking norm, battle\nwas resumed. Mental battle, this time, that went on for more than a\nhundred thousand Eddorian years; during the last ten thousand of which\nnot a single Eddorian died.\n\nRealizing the futility of such unproductive endeavor, the relatively\nfew survivors made a peace of sorts. Since each had an utterly\ninsatiable lust for power, and since it had become clear that they\ncould neither conquer nor kill each other, they would combine forces\nand conquer enough planets--enough galaxies--so that each Eddorian\ncould have as much power and authority as he could possibly handle.\n\nWhat matter that there were not that many planets in their native\nspace? There were other spaces, an infinite number of them; some of\nwhich, it was mathematically certain, would contain millions upon\nmillions of planets instead of only two or three. By mind and by\nmachine they surveyed the neighboring continua; they developed the\nhyper-spatial tube and the inertialess drive; they drove their planet,\nspace-ship-wise, through space after space after space.\n\nAnd thus, shortly after the Coalescence began, Eddore came into our\nspace-time; and here, because of the multitudes of planets already\nexisting and the untold millions more about to come into existence,\nit stayed. Here was what they had wanted since their beginnings; here\nwere planets enough, here were fields enough for the exercise of power,\nto sate even the insatiable. There was no longer any need for them to\nfight each other; they could now cooperate whole-heartedly--as long as\neach was getting more--and _more_ and MORE!\n\nEnphilisor, a young Arisian, his mind roaming eagerly abroad as was its\nwont, made first contact with the Eddorians in this space. Inoffensive,\nnaive, innocent, he was surprised beyond measure at their reception of\nhis friendly greeting; but in the instant before closing his mind to\ntheir vicious attacks, he learned the foregoing facts concerning them.\n\nThe fused mind of the Elders of Arisia, however, was not surprised. The\nArisians, while not as mechanistic as their opponents, and innately\npeaceful as well, were far ahead of them in the pure science of the\nmind. The Elders had long known of the Eddorians and of their lustful\nwanderings through plenum after plenum. Their Visualizations of the\nCosmic All had long since forecast, with dreadful certainty, the\ninvasion which had now occurred. They had long known what they would\nhave to do. They did it. So insidiously as to set up no opposition they\nentered the Eddorians' minds and sealed off all knowledge of Arisia.\nThey withdrew, tracelessly.\n\nThey did not have much data, it is true; but no more could be obtained\nat that time. If any one of those touchy suspicious minds had been\ngiven any cause for alarm, any focal point of doubt, they would have\nhad time in which to develop mechanisms able to force the Arisians out\nof this space before a weapon to destroy the Eddorians--the as yet\nincompletely designed Galactic Patrol--could be forged. The Arisians\ncould, even then, have slain by mental force alone all the Eddorians\nexcept the All-Highest and his Innermost Circle, safe within their then\nimpenetrable shield; but as long as they could not make a clean sweep\nthey could not attack--then.\n\nBe it observed that the Arisians were not fighting for themselves. As\nindividuals or as a race they had nothing to fear. Even less than the\nEddorians could they be killed by any possible application of physical\nforce. Past masters of mental science, they knew that no possible\nconcentration of Eddorian mental force could kill any one of them. And\nif they were to be forced out of normal space, what matter? To such\nmentalities as theirs, any given space would serve as well as any other.\n\nNo, they were fighting for an ideal; for the peaceful, harmonious,\nliberty-loving Civilization which they had envisaged as developing\nthroughout, and eventually entirely covering the myriads of planets\nof, two tremendous Island Universes. Also, they felt a heavy weight\nof responsibility. Since all these races, existing and yet to appear,\nhad sprung from and would spring from the Arisian life-spores which\npermeated this particular space, they all were and would be, at bottom,\nArisian. It was starkly unthinkable that Arisia would leave them to\nthe eternal dominance of such a rapacious, such a tyrannical, such a\nhellishly insatiable breed of monsters.\n\nTherefore the Arisians fought; efficiently if insidiously. They did\nnot--they could not--interfere openly with Eddore's ruthless conquest\nof world after world; with Eddore's ruthless smashing of Civilization\nafter Civilization. They did, however, see to it, by selective matings\nand the establishment of blood-lines upon numberless planets, that the\ntrend of the level of intelligence was definitely and steadily upward.\n\nFour Molders of Civilization--Drounli, Kriedigan, Nedanillor, and\nBrolenteen, who, in fusion, formed the \"Mentor of Arisia\" who was to\nbecome known to every wearer of Civilization's Lens--were individually\nresponsible for the Arisian program of development upon the four\nplanets of Tellus, Rigel IV, Velantia, and Palain VII. Drounli\nestablished upon Tellus two principal lines of blood. In unbroken male\nline of descent the Kinnisons went back to long before the dawn of\neven mythical Tellurian history. Kinnexa of Atlantis, daughter of one\nKinnison and sister of another, is the first of the blood to be named\nin these annals; but the line was then already old. So was the other\nline; characterized throughout its tremendous length, male and female,\nby peculiarly spectacular red-bronze-auburn hair and equally striking\ngold-flecked, tawny eyes.\n\nNor did these strains mix. Drounli had made it psychologically\nimpossible for them to mix until the penultimate stage of development\nshould have been reached.\n\nWhile that stage was still in the future Virgil Samms appeared, and\nall Arisia knew that the time had come to engage the Eddorians openly,\nmind to mind. Gharlane-Roger was curbed, savagely and sharply. Every\nEddorian, wherever he was working, found his every line of endeavor\nsolidly blocked.\n\nGharlane, as has been intimated, constructed a supposedly irresistible\nweapon and attacked his Arisian blocker, with results already told. At\nthat failure Gharlane knew that there was something terribly amiss;\nthat it had been amiss for over two thousand million Tellurian years.\nReally alarmed for the first time in his long life, he flashed back to\nEddore; to warn his fellows and to take counsel with them as to what\nshould be done. And the massed and integrated force of all Arisia was\nonly an instant behind him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nArisia struck Eddore's outermost screen, and in the instant of impact\nthat screen went down. And then, instantaneously and all unperceived\nby the planet's defenders, the Arisian forces split. The Elders,\nincluding all the Molders, seized the Eddorian who had been handling\nthat screen--threw around him an impenetrable net of force--yanked him\nout into inter-galactic space.\n\nThen, driving in resistlessly, they turned the luckless wight inside\nout. And before the victim died under their poignant probings, the\nElders of Arisia learned everything that the Eddorian and all of his\nancestors had ever known. They then withdrew to Arisia, leaving their\nyounger, weaker, partially-developed fellows to do whatever they could\nagainst mighty Eddore.\n\nWhether the attack of these lesser forces would be stopped at the\nsecond, the third, the fourth, or the innermost screen; whether they\nwould reach the planet itself and perhaps do some actual damage before\nbeing driven off; was immaterial. Eddore must be allowed and would\nbe allowed to repel that invasion with ease. For cycles to come the\nEddorians must and would believe that they had nothing really to fear\nfrom Arisia.\n\nThe real battle, however, had been won. The Arisian visualizations\ncould now be extended to portray every essential element of the\nclimactic conflict which was eventually to come. It was no cheerful\nconclusion at which the Arisians arrived, since their visualizations\nall agreed in showing that the only possible method of wiping out the\nEddorians would also of necessity end their own usefulness as Guardians\nof Civilization.\n\nSuch an outcome having been shown necessary, however, the Arisians\naccepted it, and worked toward it, unhesitatingly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\n\nAs has been said, The Hill, which had been built to be the Tellurian\nheadquarters of the Triplanetary Service and which was now the\nheadquarters of the half-organized Solarian Patrol, was--and is--a\ntruncated, alloy-sheathed, honey-combed mountain. But, since human\nbeings do not like to live eternally underground, no matter how\nbeautifully lighted or how carefully and comfortably air-conditioned\nthe dungeon may be, the Reservation spread far beyond the foot of\nthat gray, forbidding, mirror-smooth cone of metal. Well outside that\nfarflung Reservation there was a small city; there were hundreds\nof highly productive farms; and, particularly upon this bright May\nafternoon, there was a Recreation Park, containing, among other things,\ndozens of tennis courts.\n\nOne of these courts was three-quarters enclosed by stands, from which\na couple of hundred people were watching a match which seemed to be of\nsome little local importance. Two men sat in a box which had seats for\ntwenty, and watched admiringly the pair who seemed in a fair way to win\nin straight sets the mixed-doubles championship of the Hill.\n\n\"Fine-looking couple, Rod, if I do say so myself, as well as being\nsmooth performers.\" Solarian Councillor Virgil Samms spoke to his\ncompanion as the opponents changed courts. \"I still think, though, the\nyoung hussy ought to wear some clothes--those white nylon shorts make\nher look nakeder even than usual. I told her so, too, the jade, but she\nkeeps on wearing less and less.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Commissioner Roderick K. Kinnison laughed quietly. \"What\ndid you expect? She got her hair and eyes from you, why not your\nhard-headedness, too? One thing, though, that's all to the good--she's\ngot what it takes to strip ship that way, and most of 'em haven't. But\nwhat I can't understand is why they don't....\" He paused.\n\n\"I don't either. Lord knows we've thrown them at each other hard\nenough, and Jack Kinnison and Jill Samms would certainly make a pair to\ndraw to. But if they won't ... but maybe they will yet. They're still\nyoungsters, and they're friendly enough.\"\n\nIf Samms p\u00e8re could have been out on the court, however, instead of in\nthe box, he would have been surprised; for young Kinnison, although\nsmiling enough as to face, was addressing his gorgeous partner in terms\nwhich carried little indeed of friendliness.\n\n\"Listen, you bird-brained, knot-headed, grand-standing half-wit!\" he\nstormed, voice low but bitterly intense. \"I ought to beat your alleged\nbrains out! I've told you a thousand times to watch your own territory\nand _stay out of mine_! If you had been where you belonged, or even\ntaken my signal, Frank couldn't have made that thirty-all point; and\nif Lois hadn't netted she'd've caught you flat-footed, a kilometer\nout of position, and made it deuce. What do you think you're doing,\nanyway--playing tennis or seeing how many innocent bystanders you can\nbring down out of control?\"\n\n\"What do _you_ think?\" the girl sneered, sweetly. Her tawny eyes, only\na couple of inches below his own, almost emitted sparks. \"And just\nlook at who's trying to tell who how to do what! For your information,\nMaster Pilot John K. Kinnison, I'll tell you that just because you\ncan't quit being 'Killer' Kinnison even long enough to let two good\nfriends of ours get a point now and then, or maybe even a game, is no\nreason why I've got to turn into 'Killer' Samms. And I'll also tell\nyou....\"\n\n\"You'll tell me nothing, Jill--I'm telling _you_! Start giving away\npoints in anything and you'll find out some day that you've given away\ntoo many. I'm not having any of that kind of game--and as long as\nyou're playing with me you aren't either--or else. If you louse up this\nmatch just once more, the next ball I serve will hit the tightest part\nof those fancy white shorts of yours--right where the hip pocket would\nbe if they had any--and it'll raise a welt that will make you eat off\nof the mantel for three days. So watch your step!\"\n\n\"You insufferable lug! I'd like to smash this racket over your head!\nI'll do it, too, and walk off the court, if you don't....\"\n\nThe whistle blew. Virgilia Samms, all smiles, toed the base-line and\nbecame the personification and embodiment of smoothly flowing motion.\nThe ball whizzed over the net, barely clearing it--a sizzling service\nace. The game went on.\n\nAnd a few minutes later, in the shower room, where Jack Kinnison was\ncaroling lustily while plying a towel, a huge young man strode up and\nslapped him ringingly between the shoulder blades.\n\n\"Congratulations, Jack, and so forth. But there's a thing I want to ask\nyou. Confidential, sort of...?\"\n\n\"Shoot! Haven't we been eating out of the same dish for lo, these many\nmoons? Why the diffidence all of a sudden, Mase? It isn't in character.\"\n\n\"Well ... it's ... I'm a lip-reader, you know.\"\n\n\"Sure. We all are. What of it?\"\n\n\"It's only that ... well, I saw what you and Miss Samms said to each\nother out there, and if that was lovers' small talk I'm a Venerian\nmud-puppy.\"\n\n\"_Lovers!_ Who the hell ever said we were lovers?... Oh, you've been\ninhaling some of dad's balloon-juice. _Lovers!_ Me and that red-headed\nstinker--that jelly-brained sapadilly? _Hardly!_\"\n\n\"Hold it, Jack!\" The big officer's voice was slightly edged.\n\"You're off course--a hell of a long flit off. That girl has got\neverything. She's the class of the Reservation--why, she's a regular\ntwelve-nineteen!\"\n\n\"Huh?\" Amazed, young Kinnison stopped drying himself and stared. \"You\nmean to say you've been giving her a miss just because....\" He had\nstarted to say \"because you're the best friend I've got in the System,\"\nbut he did not.\n\n\"Well, it would have smelled slightly cheesy, I thought.\" The other\nman did not put into words, either, what both of them so deeply knew\nto be the truth. \"But if you haven't got ... if it's O.K. with you, of\ncourse....\"\n\n\"Stand by for five seconds--I'll take you around.\"\n\nJack threw on his uniform, and in a few minutes the two young officers,\nimmaculate in the space-black-and-silver of the Patrol, made their way\ntoward the women's dressing rooms.\n\n\"... but she's all right, at that ... in most ways ... I guess.\"\nKinnison was half-apologizing for what he had said. \"Outside of being\nchicken-hearted and pig-headed, she's a good egg. She really\nqualifies ... most of the time. But I wouldn't have her, bonus\nattached, any more than she would have me. It's strictly mutual. You\nwon't fall for her, either, Mase; you'll want to pull one of her legs\noff and beat the rest of her to death with it inside of a week--but\nthere's nothing like finding things out for yourself.\"\n\nIn a short time Miss Samms appeared; dressed somewhat less revealingly\nthan before in the blouse and kilts which were the mode of the moment.\n\n\"Hi, Jill! This is Mase--I've told you about him. My boat-mate. Master\nElectronicist Mason Northrop.\"\n\n\"Yes, I've heard about you, 'Troncist--a lot.\" She shook hands warmly.\n\n\"He hasn't been putting tracers on you, Jill, on accounta he figured\nhe'd be poaching. Can you feature that? I straightened him out, though,\nin short order. Told him why, too, so he ought to be insulated against\nany voltage you can generate.\"\n\n\"Oh, you did? How sweet of you! But how ... oh, those?\" She gestured at\nthe powerful prism binoculars, a part of the uniform of every officer\nof space.\n\n\"Uh-huh.\" Northrop wriggled, but held firm.\n\n\"If I'd only been as big and husky as you are,\" surveying admiringly\nsome six feet two of altitude and two hundred-odd pounds of hard\nmeat, gristle, and bone, \"I'd have grabbed him by one ankle, whirled\nhim around my head, and flung him into the fifteenth row of seats.\nWhat's the matter with him, Mase, is that he was born centuries and\ncenturies too late. He should have been an overseer when they built\nthe pyramids--flogging slaves because they wouldn't step just so. Or\nbetter yet, one of those people it told about in those funny old books\nthey dug up last year--liege lords, or something like that, remember?\nWith the power of life and death--'high, middle, and low justice',\nwhatever that was--over their vassals and their families, serfs, and\nserving-wenches. _Especially_ serving-wenches! He likes little, cuddly\nbaby-talkers, who pretend to be utterly spineless and completely\nbrainless--eh, Jack?\"\n\n\"Ouch! Touch\u00e9, Jill--but maybe I had it coming to me, at that. Let's\ncall it off, shall we? I'll be seeing you two, hither or yon.\" Kinnison\nturned and hurried away.\n\n\"Want to know why he's doing such a quick flit?\" Jill grinned up at her\ncompanion; a bright, quick grin. \"Not that he was giving up. The blonde\nover there--the one in rocket red. Very few blondes can wear such a\nviolent shade. Dimples Maynard.\"\n\n\"And is she ... er...?\"\n\n\"Cuddly and baby-talkish? Uh-uh. She's a grand person. I was just\npopping off; so was he. You know that neither of us really meant half\nof what we said ... or ... at least....\" Her voice died away.\n\n\"I don't know whether I do or not,\" Northrop replied, awkwardly but\nhonestly. \"That was savage stuff if there ever was any. I can't see for\nthe life of me why you two--two of the world's finest people--should\nhave to tear into each other that way. Do you?\"\n\n\"I don't know that I ever thought of it like that.\" Jill caught her\nlower lip between her teeth. \"He's splendid, really, and I like him a\nlot--usually. We get along perfectly most of the time. We don't fight\nat all except when we're too close together ... and then we fight about\nanything and everything ... say, suppose that that could be it? Like\ncharges, repelling each other inversely as the square of the distance?\nThat's about the way it seems to be.\"\n\n\"Could be, and I'm glad.\" The man's face cleared. \"And I'm a charge of\nthe opposite sign. Let's go!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd in Virgil Samms' deeply-buried office, Civilization's two strongest\nmen were deep in conversation.\n\n\"... troubles enough to keep four men of our size awake nights.\"\nSamms' voice was light, but his eyes were moody and somber. \"You can\nprobably whip yours, though, in time. They're mostly in one solar\nsystem; a short flit covers the rest. Languages and customs are known.\nBut how--_how_--can legal processes work efficiently--work at all,\nfor that matter--when a man can commit a murder or a pirate can loot\na space-ship and be a hundred parsecs away before the crime is even\ndiscovered? How can a Tellurian John Law find a criminal on a strange\nworld that knows nothing whatever of our Patrol, with a completely\nalien language--maybe no language at all--where it takes months even\nto find out who and where--if any--the native police officers are? But\nthere must be a way, Rod--there's _got_ to be a way!\" Samms slammed his\nopen hand resoundingly against his desk's bare top. \"And by God I'll\nfind it--the Patrol _will_ come out on top!\"\n\n\"'Crusader' Samms, now and forever!\" There was no trace of mockery in\nKinnison's voice or expression, but only friendship and admiration.\n\"And I'll bet you do. Your Interstellar Patrol, or whatever....\"\n\n\"Galactic Patrol. I know what the name of it is going to be, if nothing\nelse.\"\n\n\"... is just as good as in the bag, right now. You've done a job so\nfar, Virge. This whole system, Nevia, the colonies on Aldebaran II and\nother planets, even Valeria, as tight as a drum. Funny about Valeria,\nisn't it....\"\n\nThere was a moment of silence, then Kinnison went on:\n\n\"But wherever diamonds are, there go Dutchmen. And Dutch women\ngo wherever their men do. And, in spite of medical advice, Dutch\nbabies arrive. Although a lot of the adults died--three G's is no\njoke--practically all of the babies keep on living. Developing\nbones and muscles to fit--walking at a year and a half old--living\nnormally--they say that the third generation will be perfectly at home\nthere.\"\n\n\"Which shows that the human animal is more adaptable than some ranking\nmedicos had believed, is all. Don't try to side-track me, Rod. You\nknow as well as I do what we're up against; the new headaches that\ninter-stellar commerce is bringing with it. New vices--drugs--thionite,\nfor instance; we haven't been able to get an inkling of an idea as to\nwhere that stuff is coming from. And I don't have to tell you what\npiracy has done to insurance rates.\"\n\n\"I'll say not--look at the price of Aldebaranian cigars, the only kind\nfit to smoke! You've given up, then, on the idea that Arisia is the\npirates' GHQ?\"\n\n\"Definitely. It isn't. The pirates are even more afraid of it than\ntramp spacemen are. It's out of bounds--absolutely forbidden territory,\napparently--to everybody, my best operatives included. All we know\nabout it is the name--Arisia--that our planetographers gave it. It is\nthe first completely incomprehensible thing I have ever experienced. I\nam going out there myself as soon as I can take the time--not that I\nexpect to crack a thing that my best men couldn't touch, but there have\nbeen so many different and conflicting reports--no two stories agree on\nanything except in that no one could get anywhere near the planet--that\nI feel the need of some first-hand information. Want to come along?\"\n\n\"Try to keep me from it!\"\n\n\"But at that, we shouldn't be too surprised,\" Samms went on,\nthoughtfully. \"Just beginning to scratch the surface as we are,\nwe should expect to encounter peculiar, baffling--even completely\ninexplicable things. Facts, situations, events, and beings for which\nour one-system experience could not possibly have prepared us. In fact,\nwe already have. If, ten years ago, anyone had told you that such a\nrace as the Rigellians existed, what would you have thought? One ship\nwent there, you know--once. One hour in any Rigellian city--one minute\nin a Rigellian automobile--drives a Tellurian insane.\"\n\n\"I see your point.\" Kinnison nodded. \"Probably I would have ordered\na mental examination. And the Palainians are even worse. People--if\nyou can call them that--who live on Pluto and _like_ it! Entities so\nalien that nobody, as far as I know, understands them. But you don't\nhave to go even that far from home to locate a job of unscrewing the\ninscrutable. Who, what, and why--and for how long--was Gray Roger? And,\nnot far behind him, is this young Bergenholm of yours. And by the way,\nyou never did give me the lowdown on how come it was the 'Bergenholm',\nand not the 'Rodebush-Cleveland', that made trans-galactic commerce\npossible and caused nine-tenths of our headaches. As I get the story,\nBergenholm wasn't--isn't--even an engineer.\"\n\n\"Didn't I? Thought I did. He wasn't, and isn't. Well, the original\nRodebush-Cleveland free drive was a killer, you know....\"\n\n\"_How_ I know!\" Kinnison exclaimed, feelingly.\n\n\"They beat their brains out and ate their hearts out for months,\nwithout getting it any better. Then, one day, this kid Bergenholm\nambles into their shop--big, awkward, stumbling over his own feet. He\ngazes innocently at the thing for a couple of minutes, then says:\n\n\"'Why don't you use uranium instead of iron and rewind it so it will\nput out a wave-form like this, with humps here, and here; instead of\nthere, and there?' and he draws a couple of free-hand, but really\nbeautiful curves.\n\n\"'Why should we?' they squawk at him.\n\n\"'Because it will work that way,' he says, and ambles out as\nunconcernedly as he came in. Can't--or won't--say another word.\n\n\"Well in sheer desperation, they tried it--and it WORKED! And nobody\nhas ever had a minute's trouble with a Bergenholm since. That's why\nRodebush and Cleveland both insisted on the name.\"\n\n\"I see; and it points up what I just said. But if he's such a mental\ngiant, why isn't he getting results with his own problem, the meteor?\nOr is he?\"\n\n\"No ... or at least he wasn't as of last night. But there's a note on\nmy pad that he wants to see me sometime today--suppose we have him come\nin now?\"\n\n\"Fine! I'd like to talk to him, if it's O.K. with you and with him.\"\n\nThe young scientist was called in, and was introduced to the\nCommissioner.\n\n\"Go ahead, Doctor Bergenholm,\" Samms suggested then. \"You may talk to\nboth of us, just as freely as though you and I were alone.\"\n\n\"I have, as you already know, been called psychic,\" Bergenholm began,\nabruptly. \"It is said that I dream dreams, see visions, hear voices,\nand so on. That I operate on hunches. That I am a genius. Now I very\ndefinitely am _not_ a genius--unless my understanding of the meaning of\nthat word is different from that of the rest of mankind.\"\n\nBergenholm paused. Samms and Kinnison looked at each other. The latter\nbroke the short silence.\n\n\"The Councillor and I have just been discussing the fact that there\nare a great many things we do not know; that with the extension of our\nactivities into new fields, the occurrence of the impossible has become\nalmost a commonplace. We are able, I believe, to listen with open minds\nto anything you have to say.\"\n\n\"Very well. But first, please know that I am a scientist. As such, I\nam trained to observe; to think calmly, clearly, and analytically;\nto test every hypothesis. I do not believe at all in the so-called\nsupernatural. This universe did not come into being, it does not\ncontinue to be, except by the operation of natural and immutable laws.\nAnd I mean _immutable_, gentlemen. Everything that has ever happened,\nthat is happening now, or that ever is to happen, was, is, and will\nbe statistically connected with its predecessor event and with its\nsuccessor event. If I did not believe that implicitly, I would lose\nall faith in the scientific method. For if one single 'supernatural'\nevent or thing had ever occurred or existed it would have constituted\nan entirely unpredictable event and would have initiated a series--a\nsuccession--of such events; a state of things which no scientist will\nor can believe possible in an orderly universe.\n\n\"At the same time, I recognize the fact that I myself have done\nthings--caused events to occur, if you prefer--that I cannot explain to\nyou or to any other human being in any symbology known to our science;\nand it is about an even more inexplicable--call it 'hunch' if you\nlike--that I asked to have a talk with you today.\"\n\n\"But you are arguing in circles,\" Samms protested. \"Or are you trying\nto set up a paradox?\"\n\n\"Neither. I am merely clearing the way for a somewhat startling thing I\nam to say later on. You know, of course, that any situation with which\na mind is unable to cope; a really serious dilemma which it cannot\nresolve; will destroy that mind--frustration, escape from reality, and\nso on. You also will realize that I must have become cognizant of my\nown peculiarities long before anyone else did or could?\"\n\n\"Ah. I see. Yes, of course.\" Samms, intensely interested, leaned\nforward. \"Yet your present personality is adequately, splendidly\nintegrated. How could you possibly have overcome--reconciled--a\nsituation so full of conflict?\"\n\n\"You are, I think, familiar with my parentage?\" Samms, keen as he was,\ndid not consider it noteworthy that the big Norwegian answered his\nquestion only by asking one of his own.\n\n\"Yes ... oh, I'm beginning to see ... but Commissioner Kinnison has not\nhad access to your dossier. Go ahead.\"\n\n\"My father is Dr. Hjalmar Bergenholm. My mother, before her marriage,\nwas Dr. Olga Bjornson. Both were, and are, nuclear physicists--very\ngood ones. Pioneers, they have been called. They worked, and are still\nworking, in the newest, outermost fringes of the field.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Kinnison exclaimed. \"A mutant? Born with second sight--or\nwhatever it is?\"\n\n\"Not second sight, as history describes the phenomenon, no. The\nrecords do not show that any such faculty was ever demonstrated to the\nsatisfaction of any competent scientific investigator. What I have is\nsomething else. Whether or not it will breed true is an interesting\ntopic of speculation, but one having nothing to do with the problem now\nin hand. To return to the subject, I resolved my dilemma long since.\nThere is, I am absolutely certain, a science of the mind which is as\ndefinite, as positive, as immutable of law, as is the science of the\nphysical. While I will make no attempt to prove it to you, I _know_\nthat such a science exists, and that I was born with the ability to\nperceive at least some elements of it.\n\n\"Now to the matter of the meteor of the Patrol. That emblem was and is\npurely physical. The pirates have just as able scientists as we have.\nWhat physical science can devise and synthesize, physical science can\nanalyze and duplicate. There is a point, however, beyond which physical\nscience cannot go. It can neither analyze nor imitate the tangible\nproducts of that which I have so loosely called the science of the mind.\n\n\"I know, Councillor Samms, what the Triplanetary Service needs;\nsomething vastly more than its meteor. I also know that the need will\nbecome greater and greater as the sphere of action of the Patrol\nexpands. Without a really efficient symbol, the Solarian Patrol will\nbe hampered even more than the Triplanetary Service; and its logical\nextension into the Space Patrol, or whatever that larger organization\nmay be called, will be definitely impossible. We need something which\nwill identify any representative of Civilization, positively and\nunmistakably, wherever he may be. It must be impossible of duplication,\nor even of imitation, to which end it must kill any unauthorized entity\nwho attempts imposture. It must operate as a telepath between its owner\nand any other living intelligence, of however high or low degree, so\nthat mental communication, so much clearer and faster than physical,\nwill be possible without the laborious learning of language; or between\nus and such peoples as those of Rigel Four or of Palain Seven, both\nof whom we know to be of high intelligence and who must already be\nconversant with telepathy.\"\n\n\"Are you or have you been, reading my mind?\" Samms asked quietly.\n\n\"No,\" Bergenholm replied flatly. \"It is not and has not been necessary.\nAny man who can think, who has really considered the question, and\nwho has the good of Civilization at heart, must have come to the same\nconclusions.\"\n\n\"Probably so, at that. But no more side issues. You have a solution of\nsome kind worked out, or you would not be here. What is it?\"\n\n\"It is that you, Solarian Councillor Samms, should go to Arisia as soon\nas possible.\"\n\n\"Arisia!\" Samms exclaimed, and:\n\n\"Arisia! Of all the hells in space, why Arisia? And how can we make the\napproach? Don't you know that _nobody_ can get anywhere near that damn\nplanet?\"\n\nBergenholm shrugged his shoulders and spread both arms wide in a\npantomime of complete helplessness.\n\n\"How do you know--another of your hunches?\" Kinnison went on. \"Or did\nsomebody tell you something? _Where_ did you get it?\"\n\n\"It is not a hunch,\" the Norwegian replied, positively. \"No one told me\nanything. But I _know_--as definitely as I know that the combustion of\nhydrogen in oxygen will yield water--that the Arisians are very well\nversed in that which I have called the science of the mind; that if\nVirgil Samms goes to Arisia he will obtain the symbol he needs; that he\nwill never obtain it otherwise. As to _how_ I know these things ... I\ncan't ... I just ... I _know_ it, I tell you!\"\n\nWithout another word, without asking permission to leave, Bergenholm\nwhirled around and hurried out. Samms and Kinnison stared at each other.\n\n\"Well?\" Kinnison asked, quizzically.\n\n\"I'm going. Now. Whether I can be spared or not, and whether you think\nI'm out of control or not. I believe him, every word--and besides,\nthere's the Bergenholm. How about you? Coming?\"\n\n\"Yes. Can't say that I'm sold one hundred percent; but, as you say, the\nBergenholm is a hard fact to shrug off. And at minimum rating, it's got\nto be tried. What are you taking? Not a fleet, probably--the _Boise_?\nOr the _Chicago_?\" It was the Commissioner of Public Safety speaking\nnow, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. \"The _Chicago_, I'd\nsay--the fastest and strongest thing in space.\"\n\n\"Recommendation approved. Blast-off; twelve hundred hours tomorrow!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\n\nThe superdreadnought _Chicago_, as she approached the imaginary but\nnevertheless sharply defined boundary, which no other ship had been\nallowed to pass, went inert and crept forward, mile by mile. Every\nman, from Commissioner and Councillor down, was taut and tense. So\nwidely variant, so utterly fantastic, were the stories going around\nabout this Arisia that no one knew what to expect. They expected the\nunexpected--and got it.\n\n\"Ah, Tellurians, you are precisely on time.\" A strong, assured,\ndeeply resonant pseudo-voice made itself heard in the depths of\neach mind aboard the tremendous ship of war. \"Pilots and navigating\nofficers, you will shift course to one seventy eight dash seven twelve\nfifty three. Hold that course, inert, at one Tellurian gravity of\nacceleration. Virgil Samms will now be interviewed. He will return to\nthe consciousnesses of the rest of you in exactly six of your hours.\"\n\nPractically dazed by the shock of their first experience with\ntelepathy, not one of the _Chicago's_ crew perceived anything unusual\nin the phraseology of that utterly precise, diamond-clear thought.\nSamms and Kinnison, however, precisionists themselves, did. But, warned\nalthough they were and keyed up although they were to detect any sign\nof hypnotism or of mental suggestion, neither of them had the faintest\nsuspicion, then or ever, that Virgil Samms did not as a matter of fact\nleave the _Chicago_ at all.\n\nSamms _knew_ that he boarded a lifeboat and drove it toward the\nshimmering haze beyond which Arisia was. Commissioner Kinnison _knew_,\nas surely as did every other man aboard, that Samms did those things,\nbecause he and the other officers and most of the crew watched Samms do\nthem. They watched the lifeboat dwindle in size with distance; watched\nit disappear within the peculiarly iridescent veil of force which their\nmost penetrant ultra-beam spy-rays could not pierce.\n\nThey waited.\n\nAnd, since every man concerned _knew_, beyond any shadow of doubt and\nto the end of his life, that everything that seemed to happen actually\ndid happen, it will be so described.\n\nVirgil Samms, then, drove his small vessel through Arisia's innermost\nscreen and saw a planet so much like Earth that it might have been her\nsister world. There were the white ice-caps, the immense blue oceans,\nthe verdant continents partially obscured by fleecy banks of cloud.\n\nWould there, or would there not, be cities? While he had not known\nat all exactly what to expect, he did not believe that there would\nbe any large cities upon Arisia. To qualify for the role of _deus ex\nmachina_, the Arisian with whom Samms was about to deal would have to\nbe a super-man indeed--a being completely beyond man's knowledge or\nexperience in power of mind. Would such a race of beings have need of\nsuch things as cities? They would not. There would be no cities.\n\nNor were there. The lifeboat flashed downward--slowed--landed smoothly\nin a regulation dock upon the outskirts of what appeared to be a small\nvillage surrounded by farms and woods.\n\n\"This way, please.\" An inaudible voice directed him toward a\ntwo-wheeled vehicle which was almost, but not quite, like a Dillingham\nroadster.\n\nThis car, however, took off by itself as soon as Samms closed the door.\nIt sped smoothly along a paved highway devoid of all other traffic,\npast farms and past cottages, to stop of itself in front of the low,\nmassive structure which was the center of the village and, apparently,\nits reason for being.\n\n\"This way, please,\" and Samms went through an automatically-opened\ndoor; along a short, bare hall; into a fairly large central room\ncontaining a vat and one deeply-holstered chair.\n\n\"Sit down, please.\" Samms did so, gratefully. He did not know whether\nhe could have stood up much longer or not.\n\nHe had expected to encounter a tremendous mentality; but this was a\nthing far, far beyond his wildest imaginings. This was a brain--just\nthat--nothing else. Almost globular; at least ten feet in diameter;\nimmersed in and in perfect equilibrium with a pleasantly aromatic\nliquid--a BRAIN!\n\n\"Relax,\" the Arisian ordered, soothingly, and Samms found that he\n_could_ relax. \"Through the one you know as Bergenholm I heard of your\nneed and have permitted you to come here this once for instruction.\"\n\n\"But this ... none of this ... it isn't ... it _can't_ be real!\" Samms\nblurted. \"I am--I must be--imagining it ... and yet I know that I\n_can't_ be hypnotized--I've been psychoed against it!\"\n\n\"What is reality?\" the Arisian asked, quietly. \"Your profoundest\nthinkers have never been able to answer that question. Nor, although I\nam much older and a much more capable thinker than any member of your\nrace, would I attempt to give you its true answer. Nor, since your\nexperience has been so limited, is it to be expected that you could\nbelieve without reservation any assurances I might give you in thoughts\nor in words. You must, then, convince yourself--definitely, by means\nof your own five senses--that I and everything about you are real, as\nyou understand reality. You saw the village and this building; you see\nthe flesh that houses the entity which is I. You feel your own flesh;\nas you tap the woodwork with your knuckles you feel the impact and\nhear the vibrations as sound. As you entered this room you must have\nperceived the odor of the nutrient solution in which and by virtue of\nwhich I live. There remains only the sense of taste. Are you by any\nchance either hungry or thirsty?\"\n\n\"Both.\"\n\n\"Drink of the tankard in the niche yonder. In order to avoid any\nappearance of suggestion I will tell you nothing of its content except\nthe one fact that it matches perfectly the chemistry of your tissues.\"\n\nGingerly enough, Samms brought the pitcher to his lips--then, seizing\nit in both hands, he gulped down a tremendous draught. It was GOOD! It\nsmelled like all appetizing kitchen aromas blended into one; it tasted\nlike all of the most delicious meals he had ever eaten; it quenched his\nthirst as no beverage had ever done. But he could not empty even that\ncomparatively small container--whatever the stuff was, it had a satiety\nvalue immensely higher even than old, rare, roast beef! With a sigh of\nrepletion Samms replaced the tankard and turned again to his peculiar\nhost.\n\n\"I am convinced. That was real. No possible mental influence could so\ncompletely and unmistakably satisfy the purely physical demands of\na body as hungry and as thirsty as mine was. Thanks, immensely, for\nallowing me to come here, Mr....?\"\n\n\"You may call me Mentor. I have no name, as you understand the term.\nNow, then, please think fully--you need not speak--of your problems and\nof your difficulties; of what you have done and of what you have it in\nmind to do.\"\n\nSamms thought, flashingly and cogently. A few minutes sufficed to cover\nTriplanetary's history and the beginning of the Solarian Patrol; then,\nfor almost three hours, he went into the ramifications of the Galactic\nPatrol of his imaginings. Finally he wrenched himself back to reality.\nHe jumped up, paced the floor, and spoke.\n\n\"But there's a vital flaw, one inherent and absolutely ruinous fact\nthat makes the whole thing impossible!\" he burst out, rebelliously. \"No\none man, or group of men, no matter who they are, can be trusted with\nthat much power. The Council and I have already been called everything\nimaginable; and what we have done so far is literally nothing at\nall in comparison with what the Galactic Patrol could and must do.\nWhy, I myself would be the first to protest against the granting of\nsuch power to _anybody_. Every dictator in history, from Philip of\nMacedon to the Tyrant of Asia, claimed to be--and probably was, in his\nbeginnings--motivated solely by benevolence. How am I to think that the\nproposed Galactic Council, or even I myself, will be strong enough to\nconquer a thing that has corrupted utterly every man who has ever won\nit? Who is to watch the watchmen?\"\n\n\"The thought does you credit, youth,\" Mentor replied, unmoved. \"That is\none reason why you are here. You, of your own force, can not know that\nyou are in fact incorruptible. I, however, know. Moreover, there is an\nagency by virtue of which that which you now believe to be impossible\nwill become commonplace. Extend your arm.\"\n\nSamms did so, and there snapped around his wrist a platinum-iridium\nbracelet carrying, wrist-watch-wise, a lenticular something at which\nthe Tellurian stared in stupefied amazement. It seemed to be composed\nof thousands--millions--of tiny gems, each of which emitted pulsatingly\nall the colors of the spectrum; it was throwing out--broadcasting--a\nturbulent flood of writhing, polychromatic light!\n\n\"The successor to the golden meteor of the Triplanetary Service,\"\nMentor said, calmly. \"The Lens of Arisia. You may take my word for it,\nuntil your own experience shall have convinced you of the fact, that\nno one will ever wear Arisia's Lens who is in any sense unworthy. Here\nalso is one for your friend, Commissioner Kinnison; it is not necessary\nfor him to come physically to Arisia. It is, you will observe, in an\ninsulated container, and does not glow. Touch its surface, but lightly\nand very fleetingly, for the contact will be painful.\"\n\nSamms' finger-tip barely touched one dull, gray, lifeless jewel: his\nwhole arm jerked away uncontrollably as there swept through his whole\nbeing the intimation of an agony more poignant by far than any he had\never known.\n\n\"Why--it's _alive_!\" he gasped.\n\n\"No, it is not really alive, as you understand the term ...\" Mentor\npaused, as though seeking a way to describe to the Tellurian a thing\nwhich was to him starkly incomprehensible. \"It is, however, endowed\nwith what you might call a sort of pseudo-life; by virtue of which it\ngives off its characteristic radiation while, and only while, it is\nin physical circuit with the living entity--the ego, let us say--with\nwhom it is in exact resonance. Glowing, the Lens is perfectly harmless;\nit is complete--saturated--satiated--fulfilled. In the dark condition\nit is, as you have learned, dangerous in the extreme. It is then\nincomplete--unfulfilled--frustrated--you might say seeking or yearning\nor demanding. In that condition its pseudo-life interferes so strongly\nwith any life to which it is not attuned that that life, in a space of\nseconds, is forced out of this plane or cycle of existence.\"\n\n\"Then I--I alone--of all the entities in existence, can wear this\nparticular Lens?\" Samms licked his lips and stared at it, glowing so\nsatisfyingly and contentedly upon his wrist. \"But when I die, will it\nbe a perpetual menace?\"\n\n\"By no means. A Lens cannot be brought into being except to match some\none living personality; a short time after you pass into the next cycle\nyour Lens will disintegrate.\"\n\n\"Wonderful!\" Samms breathed, in awe. \"But there's one thing ... these\nthings are ... priceless, and there will be millions of them to\nmake ... and you don't....\"\n\n\"What will we get out of it, you mean?\" The Arisian seemed to smile.\n\n\"Exactly.\" Samms blushed, but held his ground. \"Nobody does anything\nfor nothing. Altruism is beautiful in theory, but it has never been\nknown to work in practice. I will pay a tremendous price--any price\nwithin reason or possibility--for the Lens; but I will have to know\nwhat that price is to be.\"\n\n\"It will be heavier than you think, or can at present realize; although\nnot in the sense you fear.\" Mentor's thought was solemnity itself.\n\"Whoever wears the Lens of Arisia will carry a load that no weaker mind\ncould bear. The load of authority; of responsibility; of knowledge\nthat would wreck completely any mind of lesser strength. Altruism? No.\nNor is it a case of good against evil, as you so firmly believe. Your\nmental picture of glaring white and of unrelieved black is not a true\npicture. Neither absolute evil nor absolute good do or can exist.\"\n\n\"But that would make it still worse!\" Samms protested. \"In that case,\nI can't see any reason at all for your exerting yourselves--putting\nyourselves out--for us.\"\n\n\"There is, however, reason enough; although I am not sure that I can\nmake it as clear to you as I would wish. There are in fact three\nreasons; any one of which would justify us in exerting--would compel\nus to exert--the trivial effort involved in the furnishing of Lenses\nto your Galactic Patrol. First, there is nothing either intrinsically\nright or intrinsically wrong about liberty or slavery, democracy or\nautocracy, freedom of action or complete regimentation. It seems to us,\nhowever, that the greatest measure of happiness and of well-being for\nthe greatest number of entities, and therefore the optimum advancement\ntoward whatever sublime Goal it is toward which this cycle of existence\nis trending in the vast and unknowable Scheme of Things, is to be\nobtained by securing for each and every individual the greatest amount\nof mental and physical freedom compatible with the public welfare. We\nof Arisia are only a small part of this cycle; and, as goes the whole,\nso goes in greater or lesser degree each of the parts. Is it impossible\nfor you, a fellow citizen of this cycle-universe, to believe that\nsuch fulfillment alone would be ample compensation for a much greater\neffort?\"\n\n\"I never thought of it in that light....\" It was hard for Samms to\ngrasp the concept; he never did understand it thoroughly. \"I begin to\nsee, I think ... at least, I believe you.\"\n\n\"Second, we have a more specific obligation in that the life of many,\nmany worlds has sprung from Arisian seed. Thus, _in loco parentis_, we\nwould be derelict indeed if we refused to act. And third, you yourself\nspend highly valuable time and much effort in playing chess. Why do you\ndo it? What do you get out of it?\"\n\n\"Why, I ... uh ... mental exercise, I suppose ... I like it!\"\n\n\"Just so. And I am sure that one of your very early philosophers came\nto the conclusion that a fully competent mind, from a study of one\nfact or artifact belonging to any given universe, could construct\nor visualize that universe, from the instant of its creation to its\nultimate end?\"\n\n\"Yes. At least, I have heard the proposition stated, but I have never\nbelieved it possible.\"\n\n\"It is not possible simply because no fully competent mind ever has\nexisted or ever will exist. A mind can become fully competent only by\nthe acquisition of infinite knowledge, which would require infinite\ntime as well as infinite capacity. Our equivalent of your chess,\nhowever, is what we call the 'Visualization of the Cosmic All'. In my\nvisualization a descendant of yours named Clarrissa MacDougall will, in\na store called Brenleer's upon the planet ... but no, let us consider\na thing nearer at hand and concerning you personally, so that its\naccuracy will be subject to check. Where you will be and exactly what\nyou will be doing, at some definite time in the future. Five years, let\nus say?\"\n\n\"Go ahead. If you can do that you're _good_.\"\n\n\"Five Tellurian calendar years then, from the instant of your passing\nthrough the screen of 'The Hill' on this present journey, you will\nbe ... allow me, please, a moment of thought ... you will be in a\nbarber shop not yet built; the address of which is to be fifteen\nhundred fifteen Twelfth Avenue, Spokane, Washington, North America,\nTellus. The barber's name will be Antonio Carbonero and he will be\nleft-handed. He will be engaged in cutting your hair. Or rather, the\nactual cutting will have been done and he will be shaving, with a razor\ntrade-marked 'Jensen-King-Byrd', the short hairs in front of your\nleft ear. A comparatively small, quadrupedal, grayish-striped entity,\nof the race called 'cat'--a young cat, this one will be, and called\nThomas, although actually of the female sex--will jump into your lap,\naddressing you pleasantly in a language with which you yourself are\nonly partially familiar. You call it mewing and purring, I believe?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the flabbergasted Samms managed to say. \"Cats do\npurr--especially kittens.\"\n\n\"Ah--very good. Never having met a cat personally, I am gratified at\nyour corroboration of my visualization. This female youth erroneously\ncalled Thomas, somewhat careless in computing the elements of her\ntrajectory, will jostle slightly the barber's elbow with her tail; thus\ncausing him to make a slight incision, approximately three millimeters\nlong, parallel to and just above your left cheek-bone. At the precise\nmoment in question, the barber will be applying a styptic pencil to\nthis insignificant wound. This forecast is, I trust, sufficiently\ndetailed so that you will have no difficulty in checking its accuracy\nor its lack thereof?\"\n\n\"Detailed! _Accuracy!_\" Samms could scarcely think. \"But listen--not\nthat I want to cross you up deliberately, but I'll tell you now that a\nman doesn't like to get sliced by a barber, even such a little nick as\nthat. I'll remember that address--and the cat--and I'll never go into\nthe place!\"\n\n\"Every event does affect the succession of events,\" Mentor\nacknowledged, equably enough. \"Except for this interview, you would\nhave been in New Orleans at that time, instead of in Spokane. I have\nconsidered every pertinent factor. You will be a busy man. Hence, while\nyou will think of this matter frequently and seriously during the near\nfuture, you will have forgotten it in less than five years. You will\nremember it only at the touch of the astringent, whereupon you will\ngive voice to certain self-derogatory and profane remarks.\"\n\n\"I ought to,\" Samms grinned; a not-too-pleasant grin. He had been\nappalled by the quality of mind able to do what Mentor had just done;\nhe was now more than appalled by the Arisian's calm certainty that what\nhe had foretold in such detail would in every detail come to pass.\n\"If, after all this Spokane--let a tiger-striped kitten jump into my\nlap--let a left-handed Tony Carbonero nick me--uh-uh, Mentor, UH-UH!\n_If_ I do, I'll deserve to be called everything I can think of!\"\n\n\"These that I have mentioned, the gross occurrences, are problems\nonly for inexperienced thinkers.\" Mentor paid no attention to Samms'\ndetermination never to enter that shop. \"The real difficulties lie\nin the fine detail, such as the length, mass, and exact place and\nposition of landing, upon apron or floor, of each of your hairs as\nit is severed. Many factors are involved. Other clients passing\nby--opening and shutting doors--air currents--sunshine--wind--pressure,\ntemperature, humidity. The exact fashion in which the barber will flick\nhis shears, which in turn depends upon many other factors--what he will\nhave been doing previously, what he will have eaten and drunk, whether\nor not his home life will have been happy ... you little realize,\nyouth, what a priceless opportunity this will be for me to check the\naccuracy of my visualization. I shall spend many periods upon the\nproblem. I cannot attain perfect accuracy, of course. Ninety nine point\nnine nines percent, let us say ... or perhaps ten nines ... is all that\nI can reasonably expect....\"\n\n\"But, Mentor!\" Samms protested. \"I can't help you on a thing like that!\nHow can I know or report the exact mass, length, and orientation of\nsingle hairs?\"\n\n\"You cannot; but, since you will be wearing your Lens, I myself can\nand will compare minutely my visualization with the actuality. For\nknow, youth, that wherever any Lens is, there can any Arisian be if he\nso desires. And now, knowing that fact, and from your own knowledge\nof the satisfactions to be obtained from chess and other such mental\nactivities, and from the glimpses you have had into my own mind, do you\nretain any doubts that we Arisians will be fully compensated for the\ntrifling effort involved in furnishing whatever number of Lenses may be\nrequired?\"\n\n\"I have no more doubts. But this Lens ... I'm getting more afraid of\nit every minute. I see that it is a perfect identification; I can\nunderstand that it can be a perfect telepath. But is it something else,\nas well? If it has other powers ... what are they?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell you; or, rather, I will not. It is best for your own\ndevelopment that I do not, except in the most general terms. It has\nadditional qualities, it is true; but, since no two entities ever have\nthe same abilities, no two Lenses will ever be of identical qualities.\nStrictly speaking, a Lens has no real power of its own; it merely\nconcentrates, intensifies, and renders available whatever powers are\nalready possessed by its wearer. You must develop your own powers and\nyour own abilities; we of Arisia, in furnishing the Lens, will have\ndone everything that we should do.\"\n\n\"Of course, sir; and much more than we have any right to expect. You\nhave given me a Lens for Roderick Kinnison; how about the others? Who\nis to select them?\"\n\n\"You are, for a time.\" Silencing the man's protests, Mentor went on:\n\"You will find that your judgment will be good. You will send to us\nonly one entity who will not be given a Lens, and it is necessary\nthat that one entity should be sent here. You will begin a system of\nselection and training which will become more and more rigorous as\ntime goes on. This will be necessary; not for the selection itself,\nwhich the Lensmen themselves could do among babies in their cradles,\nbut because of the benefits thus conferred upon the many who will not\ngraduate, as well as upon the few who will. In the meantime you will\nselect the candidates; and you will be shocked and dismayed when you\ndiscover how few you will be able to send.\n\n\"You will go down in history as First Lensman Samms; the Crusader,\nthe man whose wide vision and tremendous grasp made it possible for\nthe Galactic Patrol to become what it is to be. You will have highly\ncapable help, of course. The Kinnisons, with their irresistible driving\nforce, their indomitable will to do, their transcendent urge; Costigan,\nback of whose stout Irish heart lie Erin's best of brains and brawn;\nyour cousins George and Ray Olmstead; your daughter Virgilia....\"\n\n\"Virgilia! Where does _she_ fit into this picture? What do you know\nabout her--and how?\"\n\n\"A mind would be incompetent indeed who could not visualize, from even\nthe most fleeting contact with you, a fact which has been in existence\nfor some twenty three of your years. Her doctorate in psychology;\nher intensive studies under Martian and Venerian masters--even under\none reformed Adept of North Polar Jupiter--of the involuntary,\nuncontrollable, almost unknown and hence highly revealing muscles\nof the face, the hands, and other parts of the human body. You will\nremember that poker game for a long time.\"\n\n\"I certainly will.\" Samms grinned, a bit shamefacedly. \"She gave us\nclear warning of what she was going to do, and then cleaned us out to\nthe last millo.\"\n\n\"Naturally. She has, all unconsciously, been training herself for\nthe work she is destined to do. But to resume; you will feel yourself\nincompetent, unworthy--that, too, is a part of a Lensman's Load. When\nyou first scan the mind of Roderick Kinnison you will feel that he, not\nyou, should be the prime mover in the Galactic Patrol. But know now\nthat no mind, not even the most capable in the universe, can either\nvisualize truly or truly evaluate itself. Commissioner Kinnison, upon\nscanning your mind as he will scan it, will know the truth and will be\nwell content. But time presses; in one minute you leave.\"\n\n\"Thanks a lot ... thanks.\" Samms got to his feet and paused,\nhesitantly. \"I suppose that it will be all right ... that is, I can\ncall on you again, if...?\"\n\n\"No,\" the Arisian declared, coldly. \"My visualization does not indicate\nthat it will ever again be either necessary or desirable for you to\nvisit or to communicate with me or with any other Arisian.\"\n\nCommunication ceased as though a solid curtain had been drawn between\nthe two. Samms strode out and stepped into the waiting vehicle, which\nwhisked him back to his lifeboat. He blasted off; arriving in the\ncontrol room of the _Chicago_ precisely at the end of the sixth hour\nafter leaving it.\n\n\"Well, Rod, I'm back ...\" he began, and stopped; utterly unable to\nspeak. For at the mention of the name Samms' Lens had put him fully\nen rapport with his friend's whole mind; and what he perceived struck\nhim--literally and precisely--dumb.\n\nHe had always liked and admired Rod Kinnison. He had always known\nthat he was tremendously able and capable. He had known that he was\nbig; clean; a square shooter; the world's best. Hard; a driver who\nhad little more mercy on his underlings in selected undertakings than\nhe had on himself. But now, as he saw spread out for his inspection\nKinnison's ego in its entirety; as he compared in fleeting glances that\nterrific mind with those of the other officers--good men, too, all of\nthem--assembled in the room; he knew that he had never even begun to\nrealize what a giant Roderick Kinnison really was.\n\n\"What's the matter, Virge?\" Kinnison exclaimed, and hurried up, both\nhands outstretched. \"You look like you're seeing ghosts! What did they\ndo to you?\"\n\n\"Nothing--much. But 'ghosts' doesn't half describe what I'm seeing\nright now. Come into my office, will you, Rod?\"\n\nIgnoring the curious stares of the junior officers, the Commissioner\nand the Councillor went into the latter's quarters, and in those\nquarters the two Lensmen remained in close consultation during\npractically all of the return trip to Earth. In fact, they were still\nconferring deeply, via Lens, when the _Chicago_ landed and they took a\nground-car into The Hill.\n\n\"But who are you going to send first, Virge?\" Kinnison demanded. \"You\nmust have decided on at least some of them, by this time.\"\n\n\"I know of only five, or possibly six, who are ready,\" Samms replied,\nglumly. \"I would have sworn that I knew of a hundred, but they don't\nmeasure up. Jack, Mason Northrop, and Conway Costigan, for the first\nload. Lyman Cleveland, Fred Rodebush, and perhaps Bergenholm--I haven't\nbeen able to figure him out, but I'll know when I get him under my\nLens--next. That's all.\"\n\n\"Not quite. How about your identical-twin cousins, Ray and George\nOlmstead, who have been doing such a terrific job of counter-spying?\"\n\n\"Perhaps ... Quite possibly.\"\n\n\"And if I'm good enough, Clayton and Schweikert certainly are, to name\nonly two of the commodores. And Knobos and DalNalten. And above all,\nhow about Jill?\"\n\n\"Jill? Why, I don't ... she measures up, of course, but ... but at\nthat, there was nothing said against it, either ... I wonder....\"\n\n\"Why not have the boys in--Jill, too--and thrash it out?\"\n\nThe young people were called in; the story was told; the problem\nstated. The boys' reaction was instantaneous and unanimous. Jack\nKinnison took the lead.\n\n\"Of course Jill's going, if anybody does!\" he burst out vehemently.\n\"Count _her_ out, with all the stuff she's got? _Hardly_!\"\n\n\"Why, Jack! This, from _you_?\" Jill seemed highly surprised. \"I have it\non excellent authority that I'm a stinker; a half-witted one, at that.\nA jelly-brain, with come-hither eyes.\"\n\n\"You are, and a lot of other things besides.\" Jack Kinnison did not\nback up a millimeter, even before their fathers. \"But even at your\nsapadilliest your half wits are better than most other people's whole\nones; and I never said or thought that your brain couldn't function,\nwhenever it wanted to, back of those sad eyes. Whatever it takes to be\na Lensman, sir,\" he turned to Samms, \"she's got just as much of as the\nrest of us. Maybe more.\"\n\n\"I take it, then, that there is no objection to her going?\" Samms asked.\n\nThere was no objection.\n\n\"What ship shall we take, and when?\"\n\n\"The _Chicago_. Now.\" Kinnison directed. \"She's hot and ready. We\ndidn't strike any trouble going or coming, so she didn't need much\nservicing. Flit!\"\n\nThey flitted, and the great battleship made the second cruise as\nuneventfully as she had made the first. The _Chicago's_ officers and\ncrew knew that the young people left the vessel separately; that they\nreturned separately, each in his or her lifeboat. They met, however,\nnot in the control room, but in Jack Kinnison's private quarters; the\nthree young Lensmen and the girl. The three were embarrassed; ill at\nease. The Lenses were--definitely--not working. No one of them would\nput his Lens on Jill, since she did not have one.... The girl broke the\nshort silence.\n\n\"Wasn't she the most perfectly _beautiful_ thing you ever saw?\" she\nbreathed. \"In spite of being over seven feet tall? She looked to be\nabout twenty--except her eyes--but she must have been a hundred, to\nknow so much--but what are you boys staring so about?\"\n\n\"_She!_\" Three voices blurted as one.\n\n\"Yes. She. Why? I know we weren't together, but I got the impression,\nsome way or other, that there was only the one. What did _you_ see?\"\n\nAll three men started to talk at once, a clamor of noise; then all\nstopped at once.\n\n\"You first, Spud. Whom did you talk to, and what did he, she, or it\nsay?\" Although Conway Costigan was a few years older than the other\nthree, they all called him by nickname as a matter of course.\n\n\"National Police Headquarters--Chief of the Detective Bureau,\"\nCostigan reported, crisply. \"Between forty three and forty five; six\nfeet and half an inch; one seventy five. Hard, fine, keen, a Big Time\nOperator if there ever was one. Looked a lot like your father, Jill;\nthe same dark auburn hair, just beginning to gray, and the same deep\norange-yellow markings in his eyes. He gave me the works; then took\nthis Lens out of his safe, snapped it onto my wrist, and gave me two\norders--get out and stay out.\"\n\nJack and Mase stared at Costigan, at Jill, and at each other. Then they\nwhistled in unison.\n\n\"I see this is not going to be a unanimous report, except possibly in\none minor detail,\" Jill remarked. \"Mase, you're next.\"\n\n\"I landed on the campus of the University of Arisia,\" Northrop stated,\nflatly. \"Immense place--hundreds of thousands of students. They look\nme to the Physics Department--to the private laboratory of the\nDepartment Head himself. He had a panel with about a million meters\nand gauges on it; he scanned and measured every individual component\nelement of my brain. Then he made a pattern, on a milling router\njust about as complicated as his panel. From there on, of course, it\nwas simple--just like a dentist making a set of china choppers or a\nmetallurgist embedding a test-section. He snapped a couple of sentences\nof directions at me, and then said 'Scram!' That's all.\"\n\n\"Sure that was all?\" Costigan asked. \"Didn't he add 'and _stay_\nscrammed'?\"\n\n\"He didn't _say_ it, exactly, but the implication was clear enough.\"\n\n\"The one point of similarity,\" Jill commented. \"Now you, Jack. You have\nbeen looking as though we were all candidates for canvas jackets that\nlace tightly up the back.\"\n\n\"Uh-uh. As though maybe _I_ am. I didn't see anything at all. Didn't\neven land on the planet. Just floated around in an orbit inside that\nscreen. The thing I talked with was a pattern of pure force. This Lens\nsimply appeared on my wrist, bracelet and all, out of thin air. He told\nme plenty, though, in a very short time--his last word being for me not\nto come back or call back.\"\n\n\"Hm ... m ... m.\" This of Jack's was a particularly indigestible bit,\neven for Jill Samms.\n\n\"In plain words,\" Costigan volunteered, \"we all saw exactly what we\nexpected to see.\"\n\n\"Uh-uh,\" Jill denied. \"I certainly did not expect to see a\nwoman ... no; what each of us saw, I think, was what would do us the\nmost good--give each of us the highest possible lift. I am wondering\nwhether or not there was anything at all really there.\"\n\n\"That might be it, at that.\" Jack scowled in concentration. \"But there\nmust have been _something_ there--these Lenses are real. But what makes\nme mad is that they wouldn't give you a Lens. You're just as good a man\nas any one of us--if I didn't know it wouldn't do a damn bit of good\nI'd go back there right now and....\"\n\n\"Don't pop off so, Jack!\" Jill's eyes, however, were starry. \"I know\nyou mean it, and I could almost love you, at times--but I don't need a\nLens. As a matter of fact, I'll be much better off without one.\"\n\n\"Jet back, Jill!\" Jack Kinnison stared deeply into the girl's eyes--but\nstill did not use his Lens. \"Somebody must have done a terrific job of\nselling, to make you believe that ... or _are_ you sold, actually?\"\n\n\"Actually. Honestly. That Arisian was a thousand times more of a\nwoman than I ever will be, and she didn't wear a Lens--never had\nworn one. Women's minds and Lenses don't fit. There's a sex-based\nincompatibility. Lenses are as masculine as whiskers--and at that, only\na very few men can ever wear them, either. Very special men, like you\nthree and Dad and Pops Kinnison. Men with tremendous force, drive, and\nscope. Pure killers, all of you; each in his own way, of course. No\nmore to be stopped than a glacier, and twice as hard and ten times as\ncold. A woman simply _can't_ have that kind of a mind! There is going\nto be a woman Lensman some day--just one--but not for years and years;\nand I wouldn't be in her shoes for anything. In this job of mine,\nof....\"\n\n\"Well, go on. What is this job you're so sure you are going to do?\"\n\n\"Why, I don't know!\" Jill exclaimed, startled eyes wide. \"I thought I\nknew all about it, but I don't! Do you, about yours?\"\n\nThey did not, not one of them; and they were all as surprised at that\nfact as the girl had been.\n\n\"Well, to get back to this Lady Lensman who is going to appear some\nday, I gather that she is going to be some kind of a freak. She'll have\nto be, practically, because of the sex-based fundamental nature of the\nLens. Mentor didn't say so, in so many words, but she made it perfectly\nclear that....\"\n\n\"Mentor!\" the three men exclaimed.\n\nEach of them had dealt with Mentor!\n\n\"I am beginning to see,\" Jill said, thoughtfully. \"Mentor. Not a real\nname at all. To quote the Unabridged verbatim--I had occasion to look\nthe word up the other day and I am appalled now at the certainty that\nthere was a connection--quote; Mentor, a wise and faithful counselor;\nunquote. Have any of you boys anything to say? I haven't; and I am\nbeginning to be scared blue.\"\n\nSilence fell; and the more they thought, those three young Lensmen\nand the girl who was one of the two human women ever to encounter\nknowingly an Arisian mind, the deeper that silence became.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\n\n\"So you didn't find anything on Nevia.\" Roderick Kinnison got up,\ndeposited the inch-long butt of his cigar in an ashtray, lit another,\nand prowled about the room; hands jammed deep into breeches pockets.\n\"I'm surprised. Nerado struck me as being a B.T.O.... I thought sure\nhe'd qualify.\"\n\n\"So did I.\" Samms' tone was glum. \"He's Big Time, and an Operator;\nbut not big enough, by far. I'm--we're both--finding out that Lensman\nmaterial is _damned_ scarce stuff. There's none on Nevia, and no\nindication whatever that there ever will be any.\"\n\n\"Tough ... and you're right, of course, in your stand that we'll have\nto have Lensmen from as many different solar systems as possible on\nthe Galactic Council or the thing won't work at all. So damned much\njealousy--which is one reason why we're here in New York instead\nof out at The Hill, where we belong--we've found that out already,\neven in such a small and comparatively homogeneous group as our own\nsystem--the Solarian Council will not only have to be made up mostly\nof Lensmen, but each and every inhabited planet of Sol will have to\nbe represented--even Pluto, I suppose, in time. And by the way, your\nMr. Saunders wasn't any too pleased when you took Knobos of Mars and\nDalNalten of Venus away from him and made Lensmen out of them--and put\nthem miles over his head.\"\n\n\"Oh, I wouldn't say that ... exactly. I convinced him ... but at that,\nsince Saunders is not Lensman grade himself, it was a trifle difficult\nfor him to understand the situation completely.\"\n\n\"You say it easy--'difficult' is not the word I would use. But back\nto the Lensman hunt.\" Kinnison scowled blackly. \"I agree, as I said\nbefore, that we need non-human Lensmen, the more the better, but I\ndon't think much of your chance of finding any. What makes you\nthink ... Oh, I see ... but I don't know whether you're justified or\nnot in assuming a high positive correlation between a certain kind of\nmental ability and technological advancement.\"\n\n\"No such assumption is necessary. Start anywhere you please, Rod, and\ntake it from there; including Nevia.\"\n\n\"I'll start with known facts, then. Interstellar flight is new to\nus. We haven't spread far, or surveyed much territory. But in the\neight solar systems with which we are most familiar there are seven\nplanets--I'm not counting Valeria--which are very much like Earth in\npoint of mass, size, climate, atmosphere, and gravity. Five of the\nseven did not have any intelligent life and were colonized easily and\nquickly. The Tellurian worlds of Procyon and Vega became friendly\nneighbors--thank God we learned something on Nevia--because they were\nalready inhabited by highly advanced races: Procia by people as human\nas we are, Vegia by people who would be so if it weren't for their\ntails. Many other worlds of these systems are inhabited by more or less\nintelligent non-human races. Just how intelligent they are we don't\nknow, but the Lensmen will soon find out.\n\n\"My point is that no race we have found so far has had either atomic\nenergy or any form of space-drive. In any contact with races having\nspace-drives we have not been the discoverers, but the discovered.\n_Our_ colonies are all within twenty six light-years of Earth except\nAldebaran II, which is fifty seven, but which drew a lot of people,\nin spite of the distance, because it was so nearly identical with\nEarth. On the other hand, the Nevians, from a distance of over a\nhundred light-years, found _us_ ... implying an older race and a higher\ndevelopment ... but you just told me that they would _never_ produce a\nLensman!\"\n\n\"That point stopped me, too, at first. Follow through; I want to see if\nyou arrive at the same conclusion I did.\"\n\n\"Well ... I ... I ...\" Kinnison thought intensely, then went on: \"Of\ncourse, the Nevians were not colonizing; nor, strictly speaking,\nexploring. They were merely hunting for iron--a highly organized,\nintensively specialized operation to find a raw material they needed\ndesperately.\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" Samms agreed.\n\n\"The Rigellians, however, were _surveying_, and Rigel is about four\nhundred and forty light-years from here. We didn't have a thing they\nneeded or wanted. They nodded at us in passing and kept on going. I'm\nstill on your track?\"\n\n\"Dead center. And just where does that put the Palainians?\"\n\n\"I see ... you may have something there, at that. Palain is so\nfar away that nobody knows even where it is--probably thousands\nof light-years. Yet they have not only explored this system; they\ncolonized Pluto long before our white race colonized America. But damn\nit, Virge, I don't like it--any part of it. Rigel Four you may be able\nto take, with your Lens ... even one of their damned automobiles, if\nyou stay solidly en rapport with the driver. But _Palain_, Virge! Pluto\nis bad enough, but the home planet! You can't. Nobody can. It simply\ncan't be done!\"\n\n\"I know it won't be easy,\" Samms admitted, bleakly, \"but if it's got\nto be done, I'll do it. And I have a little information that I haven't\nhad time to tell you yet. We discussed once before, you remember, what\na job it was to get into any kind of communication with the Palainians\non Pluto. You said then that nobody could understand them, and you were\nright--then. However, I re-ran those brain-wave tapes, wearing my Lens,\nand could understand them--the thoughts, that is--as well as though\nthey had been recorded in precisionist-grade English.\"\n\n\"_What?_\" Kinnison exclaimed, then fell silent. Samms remained silent.\nWhat they were thinking of Arisia's Lens cannot be expressed in words.\n\n\"Well, go on,\" Kinnison finally said. \"Give me the rest of it--the\nstinger that you've been holding back.\"\n\n\"The messages--_as messages_--were clear and plain. The backgrounds,\nhowever, the connotations and implications, were not. Some of their\ncodes and standards seem to be radically different from ours--so\nutterly and fantastically different that I simply cannot reconcile\neither their conduct or their ethics with their obviously high\nintelligence and their advanced state of development. However,\nthey have at least some minds of tremendous power, and none of\nthe peculiarities I deduced were of such a nature as to preclude\nLensmanship. Therefore I am going to Pluto; and from there--I hope--to\nPalain Seven. If there's a Lensman there, I'll get him.\"\n\n\"You will, at that,\" Kinnison paid quiet tribute to what he, better\nthan anyone else, knew that his friend had.\n\n\"But enough of me--how are you doing?\"\n\n\"As well as can be expected at this stage of the game. The thing is\ndeveloping along three main lines. First, the pirates. Since that kind\nof thing is more or less my own line I'm handling it myself, unless and\nuntil you find someone better qualified. I've got Jack and Costigan\nworking on it now.\n\n\"Second; drugs, vice, and so on. I hope you find somebody to take this\nline over, because, frankly, I'm in over my depth and want to get out.\nKnobos and DalNalten are trying to find out if there's anything to\nthe idea that there may be a planetary, or even inter-planetary, ring\ninvolved. Since Sid Fletcher isn't a Lensman I couldn't disconnect him\nopenly from his job, but he knows a lot about the dope-vice situation\nand is working practically full time with the other two.\n\n\"Third; pure--or rather, decidedly impure--politics. The more I studied\n_that_ subject, the clearer it became that politics would be the worst\nand biggest battle of the three. There are too many angles I don't\nknow a damned thing about, such as what to do about the succession of\nfoaming, screaming fits your friend Senator Morgan will be throwing\nthe minute he finds out what our Galactic Patrol is going to do. So I\nducked the whole political line.\n\n\"Now you know as well as I do--better, probably--that Morgan is only\nthe Pernicious Activities Committee of the North American Senate.\nMultiply him by the thousands of others, all over space, who will be on\nour necks before the Patrol can get its space-legs, and you will see\nthat all that stuff will have to be handled by a Lensman who, as well\nas being a mighty smooth operator, will have to know _all_ the answers\nand will have to have plenty of guts. I've got the guts, but none of\nthe other prime requisites. Jill hasn't, although she's got everything\nelse. Fairchild, your Relations ace, isn't a Lensman and can never\nbecome one. So you can see quite plainly who has got to handle politics\nhimself.\"\n\n\"You may be right ... but this Lensman business comes first....\" Samms\npondered, then brightened. \"Perhaps--probably--I can find somebody on\nthis trip--a Palainian, say--who is better qualified than any of us.\"\n\nKinnison snorted. \"If you can, I'll buy you a week in any Venerian\nrelaxerie you want to name.\"\n\n\"Better start saving up your credits, then, because from what I already\nknow of the Palainian mentality such a development is distinctly more\nthan a possibility.\" Samms paused, his eyes narrowing. \"I don't know\nwhether it would make Morgan and his kind more rabid or less so to have\na non-Solarian entity possess authority in our affairs political--but\nat least it would be something new and different. But in spite of what\nyou said about 'ducking' politics, what have you got Northrop, Jill and\nFairchild doing?\"\n\n\"Well, we had a couple of discussions. I couldn't give either Jill or\nDick orders, of course....\"\n\n\"Wouldn't, you mean,\" Samms corrected.\n\n\"Couldn't,\" Kinnison insisted. \"Jill, besides being your daughter and\nLensman grade, had no official connection with either the Triplanetary\nService or the Solarian Patrol. And the Service, including Fairchild,\nis still Triplanetary; and it will have to stay Triplanetary until\nyou have found enough Lensmen so that you can spring your twin\nsurprises--Galactic Council and Galactic Patrol. However, Northrop and\nFairchild are keeping their eyes and ears open and their mouths shut,\nand Jill is finding out whatever she can about drugs and so on, as\nwell as the various political angles. They'll report to you--facts,\ndeductions, guesses, and recommendations--whenever you say the word.\"\n\n\"Nice work, Rod. Thanks. I think I'll call Jill now, before I\ngo--wonder where she is? ... but I wonder ... with the Lens perhaps\ntelephones are superfluous? I'll try it.\"\n\n\"JILL!\" he thought intensely into his Lens, forming as he did so a\nmental image of his gorgeous daughter as he knew her. But he found,\ngreatly to his surprise, that neither elaboration nor emphasis was\nnecessary.\n\n\"Ouch!\" came the almost instantaneous answer, long before his thought\nwas complete. \"Don't think so hard, Dad, it hurts--I almost missed a\nstep.\" Virgilia was actually there with him; inside his own mind; in\ncloser touch with him than she had ever before been. \"Back so soon?\nShall we report now, or aren't you ready to go to work yet?\"\n\n\"Skipping for the moment your aspersions on my present activities--not\nquite.\" Samms moderated the intensity of his thought to a\nconversational level. \"Just wanted to check with you. Come in, Rod.\" In\nflashing thoughts he brought her up to date. \"Jill, do you agree with\nwhat Rod here has just told me?\"\n\n\"Yes. Fully. So do the boys.\"\n\n\"That settles it, then--unless, of course, I can find a more capable\nsubstitute.\"\n\n\"Of course--but we will believe that when we see it.\"\n\n\"Where are you and what are you doing?\"\n\n\"Washington, D.C. European Embassy. Dancing with Herkimer Third,\nSenator Morgan's Number One secretary. I was going to make passes at\nhim--in a perfectly lady-like way, of course--but it wasn't necessary.\nHe thinks he can break down my resistance.\"\n\n\"Careful, Jill! That kind of stuff....\"\n\n\"Is very old stuff indeed, Daddy dear. Simple. And Herkimer Third isn't\nreally a menace; he just thinks he is. Take a look--you can, can't\nyou, with your Lens?\"\n\n\"Perhaps ... Oh, yes. I see him as well as you do.\" Fully en rapport\nwith the girl as he was, so that his mind received simultaneously with\nhers any stimulus which she was willing to share, it seemed as though a\nkeen, handsome, deeply tanned face bent down from a distance of inches\ntoward his own. \"But I don't like it a bit--and him even less.\"\n\n\"That's because you aren't a girl,\" Jill giggled mentally. \"This is\nfun; and it won't hurt him a bit, except maybe for a slightly bruised\nvanity, when I don't fall down flat at his feet. And I'm learning a lot\nthat he hasn't any suspicion he's giving away.\"\n\n\"Knowing you, I believe that. But don't ... that is ... well, be _very_\ncareful not to get your fingers burned. The job isn't worth it--yet.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, Dad.\" She laughed unaffectedly. \"When it comes to\nplayboys like this one, I've got millions and skillions and whillions\nof ohms of resistance. But here comes Senator Morgan himself, with a\nfat and repulsive Venerian--he's calling my boy-friend away from me,\nwith what he thinks is an imperceptible high-sign, into a huddle--and\nmy olfactory nerves perceive a rich and fruity aroma, as of\nskunk--so ... I hate to seem to be giving a Solarian Councillor the\nheave-ho, but if I want to read what goes on--and I certainly do--I'll\nhave to concentrate. As soon as you get back give us a call and we'll\nreport. Take it easy, Dad!\"\n\n\"You're the one to be told that, not me. Good hunting, Jill!\"\n\nSamms, still seated calmly at his desk, reached out and pressed a\nbutton marked \"GARAGE\". His office was on the seventieth floor;\nthe garage occupied level after level of sub-basement. The screen\nbrightened; a keen young face appeared.\n\n\"Good evening, Jim. Will you please send my car up to the Wright Skyway\nfeeder?\"\n\n\"At once, sir. It will be there in seventy five seconds.\"\n\nSamms cut off; and, after a brief exchange of thought with Kinnison,\nwent out into the hall and along it to the \"DOWN\" shaft. There,\ngoing free, he stepped through a doorless, unguarded archway into\nover a thousand feet of air. Although it was long after conventional\noffice hours the shaft was still fairly busy, but that made no\ndifference--inertialess collisions cannot even be felt. He bulleted\ndownward to the sixth floor, where he brought himself to an\ninstantaneous halt.\n\nLeaving the shaft, he joined the now thinning crowd hurrying toward\nthe exit. A girl with meticulously plucked eyebrows and an astounding\nhair-do, catching sight of his Lens, took her hands out of her breeches\npockets--skirts went out, as office dress, when up-and-down open-shaft\nvelocities of a hundred or so miles per hour replaced elevators--nudged\nher companion, and whispered excitedly:\n\n\"Look there! Quick! I never saw one close up before, did you? That's\nhim--himself! First Lensman Samms!\"\n\nAt the Portal, the Lensman as a matter of habit held out his car-check,\nbut such formalities were no longer necessary, or even possible.\nEverybody knew, or wanted to be thought of as knowing, Virgil Samms.\n\n\"Stall four sixty five, First Lensman, sir,\" the uniformed gateman told\nhim, without even glancing at the extended disk.\n\n\"Thank you, Tom.\"\n\n\"This way, please, sir, First Lensman,\" and a youth, teeth gleaming\nwhite in a startlingly black face, strode proudly to the indicated\nstall and opened the vehicle's door.\n\n\"Thank you, Danny,\" Samms said, as appreciatively as though he did not\nknow exactly where his ground-car was.\n\nHe got in. The door jammed itself gently shut. The runabout--a\nDillingham eleven-forty--shot smoothly forward upon its two fat, soft\ntires. Half-way to the exit archway he was doing forty; he hit the\nsteeply-banked curve leading into the lofty \"street\" at ninety. Nor was\nthere shock or strain. Motorcycle-wise, but automatically, the \"Dilly\"\nleaned against its gyroscopes at precisely the correct angle; the huge\nlow-pressure tires clung to the resilient synthetic of the pavement\nas though integral with it. Nor was there any question of conflicting\ntraffic, for this thoroughfare, six full levels above Varick Street\nproper, was not, strictly speaking, a street at all. It had only one\npoint of access, the one which Samms had used; and only one exit--it\nwas simply and only a feeder into Wright Skyway, a limited-access\nsuperhighway.\n\nSamms saw, without noting particularly, the maze of traffic-ways of\nwhich this feeder was only one tiny part; a maze which extended from\nground-level up to a point well above even the towering buildings of\nNew York's metropolitan district.\n\nThe way rose sharply; Samms' right foot went down a little farther;\nthe Dillingham began to pick up speed. Moving loud-speakers sang to\nhim and yelled and blared at him, but he did not hear them. Brilliant\nsigns, flashing and flaring all the colors of the spectrum--sheer\ntriumphs of the electrician's art--blazed in or flamed into arresting\nwords and eye-catching pictures, but he did not see them.\nAdvertising--designed by experts to sell everything from aardvarks to\nMartian zyzmol (\"bottled ecstacy\")--but the First Lensman was a seasoned\nbig-city dweller. His mind had long since become a perfect filter,\nadmitting to his consciousness only things which he wanted to perceive:\nonly so can big-city life be made endurable.\n\nApproaching the Skyway, he cut in his touring roadlights, slowed down\na trifle, and insinuated his low-flyer into the stream of traffic.\nThose lights threw fifteen hundred watts apiece, but there was no\nglare--polarized lenses and wind-shields saw to that.\n\nHe wormed his way over to the left-hand, high-speed lane and opened\nup. At the edge of the skyscraper district, where Wright Skyway angles\nsharply downward to ground level, Samms' attention was caught and\nheld by something off to his right--a blue-white, whistling something\nthat hurtled upward into the air. As it ascended it slowed down; its\nmonotone shriek became lower and lower in pitch; its light went down\nthrough the spectrum toward the red. Finally it exploded, with an\nearth-shaking crash; but the lightning-like flash of the detonation,\ninstead of vanishing almost instantaneously, settled itself upon a\nlow-hanging artificial cloud and became a picture and four words--two\nbearded faces and \"SMITH BROS. COUGH DROPS\"!\n\n\"Well, I'll be damned!\" Samms spoke aloud, chagrined at having been\ncompelled to listen to and to look at an advertisement. \"I thought I\nhad seen everything, but _that_ is really new!\"\n\nTwenty minutes--fifty miles--later, Samms left the Skyway at a point\nnear what had once been South Norwalk, Connecticut; an area transformed\nnow into the level square miles of New York Spaceport.\n\nNew York Spaceport; then, and until the establishment of Prime\nBase, the biggest and busiest field in existence upon any planet of\nCivilization. For New York City, long the financial and commercial\ncapital of the Earth, had maintained the same dominant position in the\naffairs of the Solar System and was holding a substantial lead over her\nrivals, Chicago, London, and Stalingrad, in the race for inter-stellar\nsupremacy.\n\nAnd Virgil Samms himself, because of the ever-increasing menace of\npiracy, had been largely responsible for the policy of basing the\nwar-vessels of the Triplanetary Patrol upon each space-field in direct\nratio to the size and importance of that field. Hence he was no\nstranger in New York Spaceport; in fact, master psychologist that he\nwas, he had made it a point to know by first name practically everyone\nconnected with it.\n\nNo sooner had he turned his Dillingham over to a smiling attendant,\nhowever, than he was accosted by a man whom he had never seen before.\n\n\"Mr. Samms?\" the stranger asked.\n\n\"Yes.\" Samms did not energize his Lens; he had not yet developed either\nthe inclination or the technique to probe instantaneously every entity\nwho approached him, upon any pretext whatever, in order to find out\nwhat that entity _really_ wanted.\n\n\"I'm Isaacson ...\" the man paused, as though he had supplied a world of\ninformation.\n\n\"Yes?\" Samms was receptive, but not impressed.\n\n\"Interstellar Spaceways, you know. We've been trying to see you for\ntwo weeks, but we couldn't get past your secretaries, so I decided to\nbuttonhole you here, myself. But we're just as much alone here as we\nwould be in either one of our offices--yes, more so. What I want to\ntalk to you about is having our exclusive franchise extended to cover\nthe outer planets and the colonies.\"\n\n\"Just a minute, Mr. Isaacson. Surely you know that I no longer have\neven a portfolio in the Council; that practically all of my attention\nis, and for some time to come will be, directed elsewhere?\"\n\n\"Exactly--_officially_.\" Isaacson's tone spoke volumes. \"But you're\nstill the Boss; they'll do anything you tell them to. We couldn't try\nto do business with you before, of course, but in your present position\nthere is nothing whatever to prevent you from getting into the biggest\nthing that will ever be. We are the biggest corporation in existence\nnow, as you know, and we are still growing--fast. We don't do business\nin a small way, or with small men; so here's a check for a million\ncredits, or I will deposit it to your account....\"\n\n\"I'm not interested.\"\n\n\"As a binder,\" the other went on, as smoothly as though his sentence\nhad not been interrupted, \"with twenty-five million more to follow on\nthe day that our franchise goes through.\"\n\n\"I'm still not interested.\"\n\n\"No ... o ... o ...?\" Isaacson studied the Lensman narrowly: and Samms,\nLens now wide awake, studied the entrepreneur. \"Well ... I ... while\nI admit that we want you pretty badly, you are smart enough to know\nthat we'll get what we want anyway, with or without you. With you,\nthough, it will be easier and quicker, so I am authorized to offer you,\nbesides the twenty six million credits ...\" he savored the words as he\nuttered them: \"twenty two and one-half percent of Spaceways. On today's\nmarket that is worth fifty million credits; ten years from now it will\nbe worth fifty _billion_. That's my high bid; that's as high as we can\npossibly go.\"\n\n\"I'm glad to hear that--I'm _still_ not interested,\" and Samms strode\naway, calling his friend Kinnison as he did so.\n\n\"Rod? Virgil.\" He told the story.\n\n\"Whew!\" Kinnison whistled expressively. \"They're not pikers, anyway,\nare they? What a _sweet_ set-up--and you could wrap it up and hand it\nto them like a pound of coffee....\"\n\n\"Or you could, Rod.\"\n\n\"Could be....\" The big Lensman ruminated. \"But _what_ a hookup!\nPerfectly legitimate, and with plenty of precedents--and arguments, of\na sort--in its favor. The outer planets. Then Alpha Centauri and Sirius\nand Procyon and so on. Monopoly--all the traffic will bear....\"\n\n\"Slavery, you mean!\" Samms stormed. \"It would hold Civilization back\nfor a thousand years!\"\n\n\"Sure, but what do _they_ care?\"\n\n\"That's it ... and he said--and actually believed--that they would get\nit without my help.... I can't help wondering about that.\"\n\n\"Simple enough, Virge, when you think about it. He doesn't know yet\nwhat a Lensman is. Nobody does, you know, except Lensmen. It will take\nsome time for that knowledge to get around....\"\n\n\"And still longer for it to be _believed_.\"\n\n\"Right. But as to the chance of Interstellar Spaceways ever getting the\nmonopoly they're working for, I didn't think I would have to remind you\nthat it was not entirely by accident that over half of the members of\nthe Solarian Council are Lensmen, and that any Galactic Councillor will\nautomatically _have_ to be a Lensman. So go right ahead with what you\nstarted, my boy, and don't give Isaacson and Company another thought.\nWe'll bend an optic or two in that direction while you are gone.\"\n\n\"I was overlooking a few things, at that, I guess.\" Samms sighed in\nrelief as he entered the main office of the Patrol.\n\nThe line at the receptionist's desk was fairly short, but even\nso, Samms was not allowed to wait. That highly decorative, but\nfar-from-dumb blonde, breaking off in mid-sentence her business of\nthe moment, turned on her charm as though it had been a battery of\nfloodlights, pressed a stud on her desk, and spoke to the man before\nher and to the Lensman:\n\n\"Excuse me a moment, please. First Lensman Samms, sir...?\"\n\n\"Yes, Miss Regan?\" her communicator--\"squawk-box\", in every day\nparlance--broke in.\n\n\"First Lensman Samms is here, sir,\" the girl announced, and broke the\ncircuit.\n\n\"Good evening, Sylvia. Lieutenant-Commander Wagner, please, or whoever\nelse is handling clearances,\" Samms answered what he thought was to\nhave been her question.\n\n\"Oh, no, sir; you are cleared. Commodore Clayton has been waiting for\nyou ... here he is, now.\"\n\n\"Hi, Virgil!\" Commodore Clayton, a big, solid man with a scarred face\nand a shock of iron-gray hair, whose collar bore the two silver stars\nwhich proclaimed him to be the commander-in-chief of a continental\ncontingent of the Patrol, shook hands vigorously. \"I'll zip you out.\nMiss Regan, call a bug, please.\"\n\n\"Oh, that isn't necessary, Alex!\" Samms protested. \"I'll pick one up\noutside.\"\n\n\"Not in any Patrol base in North America, my friend; nor, unless I am\nvery badly mistaken, anywhere else. From now on, Lensmen have absolute\npriority, and the quicker everybody realizes exactly what that means,\nthe better.\"\n\nThe \"bug\"--a vehicle something like a jeep, except more so--was waiting\nat the door. The two men jumped aboard.\n\n\"The _Chicago_--and blast!\" Clayton ordered, crisply.\n\nThe driver obeyed--literally. Gravel flew from beneath skidding tires\nas the highly maneuverable little ground-car took off. A screaming\nturn into the deservedly famous Avenue of Oaks. Along the Avenue.\nThrough the Gate, the guards saluting smartly as the bug raced past\nthem. Past the barracks. Past the airport hangars and strips. Out\ninto the space-field, the scarred and blackened area devoted solely\nto the widely-spaced docks of the tremendous vessels which plied the\nvacuous reaches of inter-planetary and inter-stellar space. Spacedocks\nwere, and are, huge and sprawling structures; built of concrete and\nsteel and asbestos and ultra-stubborn refractory and insulation\nand vacuum-breaks; fully air-conditioned and having refrigeration\nequipment of thousands of tons per hour of ice; designed not only\nto expedite servicing, unloading, and loading, but also to protect\nmaterials and personnel from the raving, searing blasts of take-off and\nof landing.\n\nA space-dock is a squat and monstrous cylinder, into whose hollow top\nthe lowermost one-third of a space-ship's bulk fits as snugly as does a\nbaseball into the \"pocket\" of a veteran fielder's long-seasoned glove.\nAnd the tremendous distances between those docks minimize the apparent\nsize, both of the structures themselves and of the vessels surmounting\nthem. Thus, from a distance, the _Chicago_ looked little enough, and\nharmless enough; but as the bug flashed under the overhanging bulk and\nthe driver braked savagely to a stop at one of the dock's entrances,\nSamms could scarcely keep from flinching. That featureless, gray,\nsmoothly curving wall of alloy steel loomed so incredibly high above\nthem--extended so terrifyingly far outward beyond its visible means of\nsupport! It _must_ be on the very verge of crashing!\n\nSamms stared deliberately at the mass of metal towering above him, then\nsmiled--not without effort--at his companion.\n\n\"You'd think, Alex, that a man would get over being afraid that a ship\nwas going to fall on him, but I haven't--yet.\"\n\n\"No, and you probably never will. I never have, and I'm one of the old\nhands. Some claim not to mind it--but not in front of a lie detector.\nThat's why they had to make the passenger docks bigger than the\nliners--too many passengers fainted and had to be carried aboard on\nstretchers--or cancelled passage entirely. However, scaring hell out of\nthem on the ground had one big advantage; they felt so safe inside that\nthey didn't get the colly-wobbles so bad when they went free.\"\n\n\"Well, I've got over _that_, anyway. Good-bye, Alex; and thanks.\"\n\nSamms entered the dock, shot smoothly upward, followed an escorting\nofficer to the captain's own cabin, and settled himself into a\ncushioned chair facing an ultra-wave view-plate. A face appeared upon\nhis communicator screen and spoke.\n\n\"Winfield to First Lensman Samms--you will be ready to blast off at\ntwenty one hundred?\"\n\n\"Samms to Captain Winfield,\" the Lensman replied. \"I will be ready.\"\n\nSirens yelled briefly; a noise which Samms knew was purely a formality.\nClearance had been issued; Station PIXNY was filling the air with\nwarnings. Personnel and material close enough to the _Chicago's_ dock\nto be affected by the blast were under cover and safe.\n\nThe blast went on; the plate showed, instead of a view of the\nspace-field, a blaze of blue-white light. The war-ship was inertialess,\nit is true; but so terrific were the forces released that incandescent\ngases, furiously driven, washed the dock and everything for hundreds of\nyards around it.\n\nThe plate cleared. Through the lower, denser layers of atmosphere the\n_Chicago_ bored in seconds; then, as the air grew thinner and thinner,\nshe rushed upward faster and faster. The terrain below became\nconcave ... then convex. Being completely without inertia, the ship's\nvelocity was at every instant that at which the friction of the medium\nthrough which she blasted her way equaled precisely the force of her\ndriving thrust.\n\nWherefore, out in open space, the Earth a fast-shrinking tiny ball and\nSol himself growing smaller, paler, and weaker at a startling rate, the\n_Chicago's_ speed attained an almost constant value; a value starkly\nimpossible for the human mind to grasp.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\n\nFor hours Virgil Samms sat motionless, staring almost unseeing into his\nplate. It was not that the view was not worth seeing--the wonder of\nspace, the ever-changing, constantly-shifting panorama of incredibly\nbrilliant although dimensionless points of light, against that wondrous\nbackground of mist-besprinkled black velvet, is a thing that never\nfails to awe even the most seasoned observer--but he had a tremendous\nload on his mind. He had to solve an apparently insoluble problem.\nHow ... _how_ ... HOW could he do what he had to do?\n\nFinally, knowing that the time of landing was approaching, he got up,\nunfolded his fans, and swam lightly through the air of the cabin to a\nhand-line, along which he drew himself into the control room. He could\nhave made the trip in that room, of course, if he had so chosen; but,\nknowing that officers of space do not really like to have strangers in\nthat sanctum, he did not intrude until it was necessary.\n\nCaptain Winfield was already strapped down at his master conning plate.\nPilots, navigators, and computers worked busily at their respective\ntasks.\n\n\"I was just going to call you, First Lensman.\" Winfield waved a\nhand in the general direction of a chair near his own. \"Take the\nLieutenant-Captain's station, please.\" Then, after a few minutes: \"Go\ninert, Mr. White.\"\n\n\"Attention, all personnel,\" Lieutenant-Captain White spoke\nconversationally into a microphone. \"Prepare for inert maneuvering,\nClass Three. Off.\"\n\nA bank of tiny red lights upon a panel turned green practically as\none. White cut the Bergenholm, whereupon Virgil Samms' mass changed\ninstantly from a weight of zero to one of five hundred and twenty\nfive pounds--ships of war then had no space to waste upon such\nnon-essentials as artificial gravity. Although he was braced for the\nchange and cushioned against it, the Lensman's breath _whooshed!_ out\nsharply; but, being intensely interested in what was going on, he\nswallowed convulsively a couple of times, gasped a few deep breaths,\nand fought his way back up to normalcy.\n\nThe Chief Pilot was now at work, with all the virtuoso's skill of his\nrank and grade; one of the hall-marks of which is to make difficult\ntasks look easy. He played trills and runs and arpeggios--at times\nveritable glissades--upon keyboards and pedals, directing with\nmicrometric precision the tremendous forces of the superdreadnaught to\nthe task of matching the intrinsic velocity of New York Spaceport at\nthe time of his departure to the I. V. of the surface of the planet so\nfar below.\n\nSamms stared into his plate; first at the incredibly tiny apparent size\nof that incredibly hot sun, and then at the barren-looking world toward\nwhich they were dropping at such terrific speed.\n\n\"It doesn't seem possible ...\" he remarked, half to Winfield, half\nto himself, \"that a sun could be that big and that hot. Rigel Four\nis almost two hundred times as far away from it as Earth is from\nSol--something like eighteen billion miles--it doesn't look much, if\nany, bigger than Venus does from Luna--yet this world is hotter than\nthe Sahara Desert.\"\n\n\"Well, blue giants are both big and hot,\" the captain replied,\nmatter-of-factly, \"and their radiation, being mostly invisible, is\ndeadly stuff. And Rigel is about the biggest in this region. There are\nothers a lot worse, though. Doradus S, for instance, would make Rigel,\nhere, look like a tallow candle. I'm going out there, some of these\ndays, just to take a look at it. But that's enough of astronomical\nchit-chat--we're down to twenty miles of altitude and we've got your\ncity just about stopped.\"\n\nThe _Chicago_ slowed gently to a halt; perched motionless upon softly\nhissing jets. Samms directed his visibeam downward and sent along it\nan exploring, questing thought. Since he had never met a Rigellian in\nperson, he could not form the mental image or pattern necessary to\nbecome en rapport with any one individual of the race. He did know,\nhowever, the type of mind which must be possessed by the entity with\nwhom he wished to talk, and he combed the Rigellian city until he found\none. The rapport was so incomplete and imperfect as to amount almost to\nno contact at all, but he could, perhaps, make himself understood.\n\n\"If you will excuse this possibly unpleasant and certainly unwarranted\nintrusion,\" he thought, carefully and slowly, \"I would like very\nmuch to discuss with you a matter which should become of paramount\nimportance to all the intelligent peoples of all the planets in space.\"\n\n\"I welcome you, Tellurian.\" Mind fused with mind at every one of\nuncountable millions of points and paths. This Rigellian professor\nof sociology, standing at his desk, was physically a monster ...\nthe oil-drum of a body, the four blocky legs, the multi-branchiate\ntentacular arms, that immobile dome of a head, the complete lack\nof eyes and of ears ... nevertheless Samms' mind fused with the\nmonstrosity's as smoothly, as effortlessly, and almost as completely as\nit had with his own daughter's!\n\nAnd _what_ a mind! The transcendent poise; the staggeringly tremendous\nrange and scope--the untroubled and unshakeable calm; the sublime\nquietude; the vast and placid certainty; the ultimate stability,\nunknown and forever unknowable to any human or near-human race!\n\n\"Dismiss all thought of intrusion, First Lensman Samms ... I have heard\nof you human beings, of course, but have never considered seriously the\npossibility of meeting one of you mind to mind. Indeed, it was reported\nthat none of our minds could make any except the barest and most\nunsatisfactory contact with any of yours they chanced to encounter. It\nis, I now perceive, the Lens which makes this full accord possible, and\nit is basically about the Lens that you are here?\"\n\n\"It is,\" and Samms went on to cover in flashing thoughts his\nconception of what the Galactic Patrol should be and should become.\nThat was easy enough; but when he tried to describe in detail the\nqualifications necessary for Lensmanship, he began to bog down. \"Force,\ndrive, scope, of course ... range ... power ... but above all, an\nabsolute integrity ... an ultimate incorruptibility....\" He could\nrecognize such a mind after meeting it and studying it, but as to\nfinding it ... It might not be in any place of power or authority. His\nown, and Rod Kinnison's, happened to be; but Costigan's was not ... and\nboth Knobos and DalNalten had made inconspicuousness a fine art....\n\n\"I see,\" the native stated, when it became clear that Samms could say\nno more. \"It is evident, of course, that I cannot qualify; nor do I\nknow anyone personally who can. However....\"\n\n\"What?\" Samms demanded. \"I was sure, from the feel of your mind, that\nyou ... but with a mind of such depth and breadth, such tremendous\nscope and power, you must be incorruptible!\"\n\n\"I am,\" came the dry rejoinder. \"We all are. No Rigellian is, or ever\nwill be or can be, what you think of as 'corrupt' or 'corruptible'.\nIndeed, it is only by the narrowest, most intense concentration upon\nevery line of your thought that I can translate your meaning into a\nconcept possible for any of us even to understand.\"\n\n\"Then what ... Oh, I see. I was starting at the wrong end. Naturally\nenough, I suppose, I looked first for the qualities rarest in my own\nrace.\"\n\n\"Of course. Our minds have ample scope and range; and, perhaps,\nsufficient power. But those qualities which you refer to as 'force'\nand 'drive' are fully as rare among us as absolute mental integrity is\namong you. What you know as 'crime' is unknown. We have no police, no\ngovernment, no laws, no organized armed forces of any kind. We take,\npractically always, the line of least resistance. We live and let live,\nas your thought runs. We work together for the common good.\"\n\n\"Well ... I don't know what I expected to find here, but certainly not\nthis....\" If Samms had never before been completely thunderstruck,\ncompletely at a loss, he was then. \"You don't think, then, that there\nis any chance?\"\n\n\"I have been thinking, and there may be a chance ... a slight one,\nbut still a chance,\" the Rigellian said, slowly. \"For instance, that\nyouth, so full of curiosity, who first visited your planet. Thousands\nof us have wondered, to ourselves and to each other, about the\npeculiar qualities of mind which compelled him and others to waste\nso much time, effort, and wealth upon a project so completely useless\nas exploration. Why, he had even to develop energies and engines\ntheretofore unknown, and which can never be of any real use!\"\n\nSamms was shaken by the calm finality with which the Rigellian\ndismissed all possibility of the usefulness of inter-stellar\nexploration, but stuck doggedly to his purpose.\n\n\"However slight the chance, I must find and talk to this man. I suppose\nhe is now out in deep space somewhere. Have you any idea where?\"\n\n\"He is now in his home city, accumulating funds and manufacturing fuel\nwith which to continue his pointless activities. That city is named ...\nthat is, in your English you might call it ... Suntown? Sunberg? No, it\nmust be more specific ... Rigelsville? Rigel City?\"\n\n\"Rigelston, I would translate it?\" Samms hazarded.\n\n\"Exactly--Rigelston.\" The professor marked its location upon a globular\nmental map far more accurate and far more detailed than the globe which\nCaptain Winfield and his lieutenant were then studying.\n\n\"Thanks. Now, can you and will you get in touch with this explorer and\nask him to call a meeting of his full crew and any others who might be\ninterested in the project I have outlined?\"\n\n\"I can. I will. He and his kind are not quite sane, of course, as\nyou know; but I do not believe that even they are so insane as to be\nwilling to subject themselves to the environment of your vessel.\"\n\n\"They will not be asked to come here. The meeting will be held in\nRigelston. If necessary, I shall insist that it be held there.\"\n\n\"You would? I perceive that you would. It is strange ... yes,\nfantastic ... you are quarrelsome, pugnacious, anti-social, vicious,\nsmall-bodied and small-brained; timid, nervous, and highly and\nsenselessly excitable; unbalanced and unsane; as sheerly monstrous\nmentally as you are physically....\" These outrageous thoughts were sent\nas casually and as impersonally as though the sender were discussing\nthe weather. He paused, then went on: \"And yet, to further such a\ncompletely visionary project, you are eager to subject yourself to\nconditions whose counterparts I could not force myself, under any\ncircumstances whatever, to meet. It may be ... it must be true that\nthere is an extension of the principle of working together for the\ncommon good which my mind, for lack of pertinent data, has not been\nable to grasp. I am now en rapport with Dronvire the explorer.\"\n\n\"Ask him, please, not to identify himself to me. I do not want to go\ninto that meeting with any preconceived ideas.\"\n\n\"A balanced thought,\" the Rigellian approved. \"Someone will be at the\nairport to point out to you the already desolated area in which the\nspace-ship of the explorers makes its so-frightful landings; Dronvire\nwill ask someone to meet you at the airport and bring you to the place\nof meeting.\"\n\nThe telepathic line snapped and Samms turned a white and sweating face\nto the _Chicago's_ captain.\n\n\"God, what a strain! Don't ever try telepathy unless you positively\nhave to--especially not with such an outlandishly _different_ race as\nthese Rigellians are!\"\n\n\"Don't worry; I won't.\" Winfield's words were not at all sympathetic,\nbut his tone was. \"You looked as though somebody was beating your\nbrains out with a spiked club. Where next, First Lensman?\"\n\nSamms marked the location of Rigelston upon the vessel's chart, then\ndonned ear-plugs and a special, radiation-proof suit of armor, equipped\nwith refrigerators and with extra-thick blocks of lead glass to protect\nthe eyes.\n\nThe airport, an extremely busy one well outside the city proper, was\nlocated easily enough, as was the spot upon which the Tellurian ship\nwas to land. Lightly, slowly, she settled downward, her jets raving\nout against a gravity fully twice that of her native Earth. Those\nblasts, however, added little or nothing to the destruction already\naccomplished by the craft then lying there--a torpedo-shaped cruiser\nhaving perhaps one-twentieth of the _Chicago's_ mass and bulk.\n\nThe superdreadnaught landed, sinking into the hard, dry ground to a\ndepth of some ten or fifteen feet before she stopped. Samms, en rapport\nwith the entity who was to be his escort, made a flashing survey of the\nmind so intimately in contact with his own. No use. This one was not\nand never could become Lensman material. He climbed heavily down the\nladder. This double-normal gravity made the going a bit difficult, but\nhe could stand that a lot better than some of the other things he was\ngoing to have to take. The Rigellian equivalent of an automobile was\nthere, waiting for him, its door invitingly open.\n\nSamms had known--in general--what to expect. The two-wheeled chassis\nwas more or less similar to that of his own Dillingham. The body\nwas a narrow torpedo of steel, bluntly pointed at both ends, and\nwithout windows. Two features, however, were both unexpected and\nunpleasant--the hard, tough steel of which that body was forged\nwas an inch and a half thick, instead of one-sixteenth; and even\nthat extraordinarily armored body was dented and scarred and marred,\nespecially about the fore and rear quarters, as deeply and as badly and\nas casually as are the fenders of an Earthly jalopy!\n\nThe Lensman climbed, not easily or joyously, into that grimly\nforbidding black interior. Black? It was so black that the\nport-hole-like doorway seemed to admit no light at all. It was blacker\nthan a witch's cat in a coal cellar at midnight! Samms flinched; then,\nstiffening, thought at the driver.\n\n\"My contact with you seems to have slipped. I'm afraid that I will\nhave to cling to you rather more tightly than may be either polite or\ncomfortable. Deprived of sight, and without your sense of perception, I\nam practically helpless.\"\n\n\"Come in, Lensman, by all means. I offered to maintain full\nengagement, but it seemed to me that you declined it; quite possibly\nthe misunderstanding was due to our unfamiliarity with each others'\ncustomary mode of thought. Relax, please, and come in ... there!\nBetter?\"\n\n\"Infinitely better. Thanks.\"\n\nAnd it was. The darkness vanished; through the unexplainable perceptive\nsense of the Rigellian he could \"see\" everything--he had a practically\nperfect three-dimensional view of the entire circumambient sphere. He\ncould see both the inside and the outside of the ground car he was in\nand of the immense space-ship in which he had come to Rigel IV. He\ncould see the bearings and the wrist-pins of the internal-combustion\nengine of the car, the interior structure of the welds that held the\nsteel plates together, the busy airport outside, and even deep into\nthe ground. He could see and study in detail the deepest-buried, most\nheavily shielded parts of the atomic engines of the _Chicago_.\n\nBut he was wasting time. He could also plainly see a deeply-cushioned\nchair, designed to fit a human body, welded to a stanchion and equipped\nwith half a dozen padded restraining straps. He sat down quickly;\nstrapped himself in.\n\n\"Ready?\"\n\n\"Ready.\"\n\nThe door banged shut with a clangor which burst through space-suit and\near-plugs with all the violence of a nearby thunderclap. And that was\nmerely the beginning. The engine started--an internal-combustion engine\nof well over a thousand horsepower, designed for maximum efficiency\nby engineers in whose lexicon there were no counterparts of any\nEnglish words relating to noise, or even to sound. The car took off;\nwith an acceleration which drove the Tellurian backward, deep into the\ncushions. The scream of tortured tires and the crescendo bellowing\nof the engine combined to form an uproar which, amplified by and\nreverberating within the resonant shell of metal, threatened to addle\nthe very brain inside the Lensman's skull.\n\n\"You suffer!\" the driver exclaimed, in high concern. \"They cautioned\nme to start and stop gently, to drive slowly and carefully, to bump\nsoftly. They told me you are frail and fragile, a fact which I\nperceived for myself and which has caused me to drive with the utmost\npossible care and restraint. Is the fault mine? Have I been too rough?\"\n\n\"Not at all. It isn't that. It's the ungodly noise.\" Then, realizing\nthat the Rigellian could have no conception of his meaning, he\ncontinued quickly:\n\n\"The vibrations in the atmosphere, from sixteen cycles per second up\nto about nine or ten thousand.\" He explained what a second was. \"My\nnervous system is very sensitive to those vibrations. But I expected\nthem and shielded myself against them as adequately as I could. Nothing\ncan be done about them. Go ahead.\"\n\n\"Atmospheric vibrations? _Atmospheric_ vibrations? Atmospheric\n_vibrations_?\" The driver marveled, and concentrated upon this entirely\nnew concept while he--\n\n1. Swung around a steel-sheathed concrete pillar at a speed of at least\nsixty miles per hour, grazing it so closely that he removed one layer\nof protective coating from the metal.\n\n2. Braked so savagely to miss a wildly careening truck that the\nrestraining straps almost cut Samms' body, space-suit and all, into\nslices.\n\n3. Darted into a hole in the traffic so narrow that only tiny fractions\nof inches separated his hurtling Juggernaut from an enormous steel\ncolumn on one side and another speeding vehicle on the other.\n\n4. Executed a double-right-angle reverse curve, thus missing by hair's\nbreadths two vehicles traveling in the opposite direction and one in\nhis own.\n\n5. As a grand climax to this spectacular exhibition of insane driving,\nhe plunged at full speed into a traffic artery which seemed so full\nalready that it could not hold even one more car. But it could--just\nbarely could. However, instead of near misses or grazing hits, this\ntime there were bumps, dents--little ones, nothing at all, really,\nonly an inch or so deep--and an utterly hellish concatenation and\nconcentration of noise.\n\n\"I fail completely to understand what effect such vibrations could\nhave,\" the Rigellian announced finally, sublimely unconscious that\nanything at all out of the ordinary had occurred. For him, nothing had.\n\"But surely they cannot be of any use?\"\n\n\"On this world, I am afraid not. No,\" Samms admitted, wearily. \"Here,\ntoo, apparently, as everywhere, the big cities are choking themselves\nto death with their own traffic.\"\n\n\"Yes. We build and build, but never have roads enough.\"\n\n\"What are those mounds along the streets?\" For some time Samms had been\nconscious of those long, low, apparently opaque structures; attracted\nto them because they were the only non-transparent objects within range\nof the Rigellian's mind. \"Or is it something I should not mention?\"\n\n\"What? Oh, those? By no means.\"\n\nOne of the nearby mounds lost its opacity. It was filled with swirling,\ngyrating bands and streamers of energy so vivid and so solid as to\nresemble fabric; with wildly hurtling objects of indescribable shapes\nand contours; with brilliantly flashing symbols which Samms found,\ngreatly to his surprise, made sense--not through the Rigellian's mind,\nbut through his own Lens:\n\n\"EAT TEEGMEE'S FOOD!\"\n\n\"Advertising!\" Samms' thought was a snort.\n\n\"Advertising. You do not perceive yours, either, as you drive?\" This\nwas the first bond to be established between two of the most highly\nadvanced races of the First Galaxy!\n\nThe frightful drive continued; the noise grew worse and worse. Imagine,\nif you can, a city of fifteen millions of people, throughout whose\nentire length, breadth, height, and depth no attempt whatever had\never been made to abate any noise, however violent or piercing! If\nyour imagination has been sufficiently vivid and if you have worked\nunderstandingly enough, the product may approximate what First Lensman\nSamms was forced to listen to that day.\n\nThrough ever-thickening traffic, climbing to higher and ever higher\nroadways between towering windowless walls of steel, the massive\nRigellian automobile barged and banged its way. Finally it stopped, a\nthousand feet or so above the ground, beside a building which was still\nunder construction. The heavy door clanged open. They got out.\n\nAnd then--it chanced to be daylight at the time--Samms saw a tangle\nof fighting, screaming _colors_ whose like no entity possessing the\nsense of sight had ever before imagined. Reds, yellows, blues, greens,\npurples, and every variation and inter-mixture possible; laid on or\nsplashed on or occurring naturally at perfect random, smote his eyes as\nviolently as the all-pervading noise had been assailing his ears.\n\nHe realized then that through his guide's sense of perception he had\nbeen \"seeing\" only in shades of gray, that to these people \"visible\"\nlight differed only in wave-length from any other band of the complete\nelectromagnetic spectrum of vibration.\n\nStrained and tense, the Lensman followed his escort along a narrow\ncatwalk, through a wall upon which riveters and welders were busily at\nwork, into a room practically without walls and ceiled only by story\nafter story of huge I-beams. Yet _this_ was the meeting-place; almost a\nhundred Rigellians were assembled there!\n\nAnd as Samms walked toward the group a craneman dropped a couple of\ntons of steel plate, from a height of eight or ten feet, upon the floor\ndirectly behind him.\n\n\"I just about jumped right out of my armor,\" is the way Samms himself\ndescribed his reactions; and that description is perhaps as good as any.\n\nAt any rate, he went briefly out of control, and the Rigellian sent him\na steadying, inquiring, wondering thought. He could no more understand\nthe Tellurian's sensitivity than Samms could understand the fact that\nto these people, even the concept of physical intrusion was absolutely\nincomprehensible. These builders were not workmen, in the Tellurian\nsense. They were Rigellians, each working his few hours per week for\nthe common good. They would be no more in contact with the meeting than\nwould their fellows on the other side of the planet.\n\nSamms closed his eyes to the riot of clashing colors, deafened himself\nby main strength to the appalling clangor of sound, forced himself to\nconcentrate every fiber of his mind upon his errand.\n\n\"Please synchronize with my mind, as many of you as possible,\" he\nthought at the group as a whole, and went en rapport with mind after\nmind after mind. And mind after mind after mind lacked something. Some\nwere stronger than others, had more initiative and drive and urge, but\nnone would quite do. Until--\n\n\"Thank God!\" In the wave of exultant relief, of fulfillment, Samms\nno longer saw the colors or heard the din. \"You, sir, are of Lensman\ngrade. I perceive that you are Dronvire.\"\n\n\"Yes, Virgil Samms, I am Dronvire; and at long last I know what it\nis that I have been seeking all my life. But how of these, my other\nfriends? Are not some of them...?\"\n\n\"I do not know, nor is it necessary that I find out. You will\nselect ...\" Samms paused, amazed. The other Rigellians were still in\nthe room, but mentally, he and Dronvire were completely alone.\n\n\"They anticipated your thought, and, knowing that it was to be more or\nless personal, they left us until one of us invites them to return.\"\n\n\"I like that, and appreciate it. You will go to Arisia. You will\nreceive your Lens. You will return here. You will select and send to\nArisia as many or as few of your fellows as you choose. These things\nI require you, by the Lens of Arisia, to do. Afterward--please note\nthat this is in no sense obligatory--I would like very much to have you\nvisit Earth and accept appointment to the Galactic Council. Will you?\"\n\n\"I will.\" Dronvire needed no time to consider his decision.\n\nThe meeting was dismissed. The same entity who had been Samms'\nchauffeur on the in-bound trip drove him back to the _Chicago_,\ndriving as \"slowly\" and as \"carefully\" as before. Nor, this time,\ndid the punishment take such toll, even though Samms knew that each\nterrific lunge and lurch was adding one more bruise to the already\nmuch-too-large collection discoloring almost every square foot of his\ntough hide. He had succeeded, and the thrill of success had its usual\nanalgesic effect.\n\nThe _Chicago's_ captain met him in the air-lock and helped him remove\nhis suit.\n\n\"Are you _sure_ you're all right, Samms?\" Winfield was no longer the\nformal captain, but a friend. \"Even though you didn't call, we were\nbeginning to wonder ... you look as though you'd been to a Valerian\nclambake, and I sure as hell don't like the way you're favoring those\nribs and that left leg. I'll tell the boys you got back in A-prime\nshape, but I'll have the doctors look you over, just to make sure.\"\n\nWinfield made the announcement, and through his Lens Samms could\nplainly feel the wave of relief and pleasure that spread throughout the\ngreat ship with the news. It surprised him immensely. Who was _he_,\nthat all these boys should care so much whether he lived or died?\n\n\"I'm perfectly all right,\" Samms protested. \"There's nothing at all the\nmatter with me that twenty hours of sleep won't fix as good as new.\"\n\n\"Maybe; but you'll go to the sick-bay first, just the same,\" Winfield\ninsisted. \"And I suppose you want me to blast back to Tellus?\"\n\n\"Right. And fast. The Ambassadors' Ball is next Tuesday evening, you\nknow, and that's one function I can't stay away from, even with a Class\nA Double Prime excuse.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\n\nThe Ambassadors' Ball, one of the most ultra-ultra functions of the\nyear, was well under way. It was not that everyone who was anyone was\nthere; but everyone who was there was, in one way or another, very\nemphatically someone. Thus, there were affairs at which there were more\nyoung and beautiful women, and more young and handsome men; but none\nexhibiting newer or more expensive gowns, more ribbons and decorations,\nmore or costlier or more refined jewelry, or a larger acreage of\npowdered and perfumed epidermis.\n\nAnd even so, the younger set was well enough represented. Since\npioneering appeals more to youth than to age, the men representing the\ncolonies were young; and their wives, together with the daughters and\nthe second (or third or fourth, or occasionally the fifth) wives of the\nhuman personages practically balanced the account.\n\nNor was the throng entirely human. The time had not yet come, of\ncourse, when warm-blooded, oxygen-breathing monstrosities from hundreds\nof other solar systems would vie in numbers with the humanity present.\nThere were, however, a few Martians on the floor, wearing their light\n\"robes du convention\" and dancing with meticulously mathematical\nprecision. A few Venerians, who did not dance, sat in state or waddled\nimportantly about. Many worlds of the Solarian System, and not a few\nother systems, were represented.\n\nOne couple stood out, even against that opulent and magnificent\nbackground. Eyes followed them wherever they went.\n\nThe girl was tall, trim, supple; built like a symphony. Her Callistan\nvexto-silk gown, of the newest and most violent shade of \"radio-active\"\ngreen, was phosphorescently luminous; fluorescent; gleaming and\nglowing. Its hem swept the floor, but above the waist it vanished\nmysteriously except for wisps which clung to strategic areas here and\nthere with no support, apparently, except the personal magnetism of the\nwearer. She, almost alone of all the women there, wore no flowers. Her\nonly jewelry was a rosette of huge, perfectly-matched emeralds, perched\nprecariously upon her bare left shoulder. Her hair, unlike the other\nwomen's flawless coiffures, was a flamboyant, artistically-disarranged,\nred-bronze-auburn mop. Her soft and dewy eyes--Virgilia Samms could\ncontrol her eyes as perfectly as she could her highly educated\nhands--were at the moment gold-flecked, tawny wells of girlish\ninnocence and trust.\n\n\"But I _can't_ give you this next dance, too, Herkimer--_Honestly_ I\ncan't!\" she pleaded, snuggling just a trifle closer into the embrace of\nthe young man who was just as much man, physically, as she was woman.\n\"I'd just _love_ to, really, but I just simply _can't_, and you know\nwhy, too.\"\n\n\"You've got some duty-dances, of course ...\"\n\n\"_Some?_ I've got a list as long as from here to there! Senator\nMorgan first, of course, then Mr. Isaacson, then I sat one out with\nMr. Ossmen--I can't _stand_ Venerians, they're so slimy and fat and\nrepulsive!--and that leathery horned toad from Mars and that Jovian\nhippopotamus ...\"\n\nShe went down the list, and as she named or characterized each entity\nanother finger of her left hand pressed down upon the back of her\npartner's right, to emphasize the count of her social obligations. But\nthose talented fingers were doing more--far, far more--than that.\n\nHerkimer Third, although no little of a Don Juan, was a highly\npolished, smoothly finished, thoroughly seasoned diplomat. As such, his\neyes and his other features--particularly his eyes--had been schooled\nfor years to reveal no trace of whatever might be going on inside his\nbrain. If he had entertained any suspicion of the beautiful girl in\nhis arms, if anyone had suggested that she was trying her best to pump\nhim, he would have smiled the sort of smile which only the top-drawer\ndiplomat can achieve. He was not suspicious of Virgilia Samms. However,\nsimply because she was Virgil Samms' daughter, he took an extra bit of\npain to betray no undue interest in any one of the names she recited.\nAnd besides, she was not looking at his eyes, nor even at his face. Her\nglance, demurely downcast, was all too rarely raised above the level of\nhis chin.\n\nThere were some things, however, that Herkimer Herkimer Third did not\nknow. That Virgilia Samms was the most accomplished muscle-reader of\nher times. That she was so close to him, not because of his manly\ncharm, but because only in that position could she do her prodigious\nbest. That she could work with her eyes alone, but in emergencies,\nwhen fullest possible results were imperative, she had to use her\nexquisitely sensitive fingers and her exquisitely tactile skin. That\nshe had studied intensively, and had tabulated the reactions of, each\nof the entities on her list. That she was now, with his help, fitting\nthose reactions into a pattern. And finally, that that pattern was\nbeginning to assume the grim shape of MURDER!\n\nAnd Virgilia Samms, working now for something far more urgent and\nvastly more important than a figmental Galactic Patrol, hoped\ndesperately that this Herkimer was not a muscle-reader too; for she\nknew that she was revealing her secrets even more completely than was\nhe. In fact, if things got much worse, he could not help but feel the\npounding of her heart ... but she could explain that easily enough, by\na few appropriate wiggles ... No, he wasn't a reader, definitely not.\nHe wasn't watching the right places; he was looking where that gown had\nbeen designed to make him look, and nowhere else ... and no tell-tale\nmuscles lay beneath any part of either of his hands.\n\nAs her eyes and her fingers and her lovely torso sent more and more\ninformation to her keen brain, Jill grew more and more anxious. She\nwas sure that murder was intended, but who was to be the victim? Her\nfather? Probably. Pops Kinnison? Possibly. Somebody else? Barely\npossibly. And when? And where? And how? She _didn't know_! And she\nwould have to be _sure_ ... Mentioning names hadn't been enough, but a\npersonal appearance ... Why _didn't_ dad show up--or did she wish he\nwouldn't come at all...?\n\nVirgil Samms entered the ball-room.\n\n\"And dad told me, Herkimer,\" she cooed sweetly, gazing up into his eyes\nfor the first time in over a minute, \"that I must dance with every one\nof them. So you see ... Oh, there he is now, over there! I've been\nwondering where he's been keeping himself.\" She nodded toward the\nentrance and prattled on artlessly. \"He's almost _never_ late, you\nknow, and I've ...\"\n\nHe looked, and as his eyes met those of the First Lensman, Jill learned\nthree of the facts she needed so badly to know. Her father. Here. Soon.\nShe never knew how she managed to keep herself under control; but, some\nway and just barely, she did.\n\nAlthough nothing showed, she was seething inwardly: wrought up as\nshe had never before been. What could she do? She _knew_, but she did\nnot have a scrap or an iota of visible or tangible evidence; and if\nshe made one single slip, however slight, the consequences could be\nimmediate and disastrous.\n\nAfter this dance might be too late. She could make an excuse to leave\nthe floor, but that would look very bad, later ... and none of them\nwould Lens her, she knew, while she was with Herkimer--_damn_ such\nchivalry!... She _could_ take the chance of waving at her father, since\nshe hadn't seen him for so long ... no, the smallest risk would be with\nMase. He looked at her every chance he got, and she'd _make_ him use\nhis Lens ...\n\nNorthrop looked at her; and over Herkimer's shoulder, for one fleeting\ninstant, she allowed her face to reveal the terrified appeal she so\nkeenly felt.\n\n\"Want me, Jill?\" His Lensed thought touched only the outer fringes of\nher mind. Full rapport is more intimate than a kiss: no one except her\nfather had ever really put a Lens on Virgilia Samms. Nevertheless:\n\n\"_Want_ you! I never wanted anybody so much in my life! Come in,\nMase--quick--_please_!\"\n\nDiffidently enough, he came; but at the first inkling of the girl's\nnews all thought of diffidence or of privacy vanished.\n\n\"Jack! Spud! Mr. Kinnison! Mr. Samms!\" he Lensed sharp, imperative,\nalmost frantic thoughts. \"Listen in!\"\n\n\"Steady, Mase, I'll take over,\" came Roderick Kinnison's deeper,\nquieter mental voice. \"First, the matter of guns. Anybody except me\nwearing a pistol? You are, Spud?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"You would be. But you and Mase, Jack?\"\n\n\"We've got our Lewistons!\"\n\n\"You would have. Blasters, my sometimes-not-quite-so-bright son, are\nfine weapons indeed for certain kinds of work. In emergencies, it is\nof course permissible to kill a few dozen innocent bystanders. In such\na crowd as this, though, it is much better technique to kill only the\none you are aiming at. So skip out to my car, you two, right now, and\nchange--and make it _fast_.\" Everyone knew that Roderick Kinnison's car\nwas at all times an arsenal on wheels. \"Wish you were in uniform, too,\nVirge, but it can't be helped now. Work your way--_slowly_--around to\nthe northwest corner. Spud, do the same.\"\n\n\"It's impossible--starkly unthinkable!\" and \"I'm not _sure_ of\nanything, really ...\" Samms and his daughter began simultaneously to\nprotest.\n\n\"Virgil, you talk like a man with a paper nose. Keep still until after\nyou've used your brain. And I'm sure enough of what you know, Jill, to\ntake plenty of steps. You can relax now--take it easy. We're covering\nVirgil and I called up support in force. You _can_ relax a little,\nI see. Good! I'm not trying to hide from anybody that the next few\nminutes may be critical. Are you pretty sure, Jill, that Herkimer is a\nkey man?\"\n\n\"Pretty sure, Pops.\" _How_ much better she felt, now that the Lensmen\nwere on guard! \"In this one case, at least.\"\n\n\"Good! Then let him talk you into giving him every dance, right\nstraight through until something breaks. Watch him. He must know the\nsignal and who is going to operate, and if you can give us a fraction\nof a second of warning it will help no end. Can do?\"\n\n\"I'll say I can--and I would love to, the big, slimy, stinking\nskinker!\" As transliterated into words, the girl's thought may seem a\ntrifle confused, but Kinnison knew exactly what she meant.\n\n\"One more thing, Jill; a detail. The boys are coming back in and are\nworking their partners over this way. See if Herkimer notices that they\nhave changed their holsters.\"\n\n\"No, he didn't notice,\" Jill reported, after a moment. \"But I don't\nnotice any difference, either, and I'm looking for it.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, it's there, and the difference between a Mark Seventeen\nand a Mark Five is something more than that between Tweedledum and\nTweedledee,\" Kinnison returned, dryly. \"However, it may not be as\nobvious to non-military personnel as it is to us. That's far enough,\nboys, don't get too close. Now, Virge, keep solidly en rapport with\nJill on one side and with us on the other, so that she won't have to\ngive herself and the show away by yelling and pointing, and ...\"\n\n\"But this is preposterous!\" Samms stormed.\n\n\"Preposterous, hell,\" Roderick Kinnison's thought was still coldly\nlevel; only the fact that he was beginning to use non-ballroom language\nrevealed any sign of the strain he was under. \"Stop being so goddam\nheroic and start using your brain. You turned down fifty billion\ncredits. Why do you suppose they offered that much, when they can get\nanybody killed for a hundred? And what would they do about it?\"\n\n\"But they couldn't get away with it, Rod, at an Ambassadors' Ball. They\n_couldn't_, possibly.\"\n\n\"Formerly, no. That was my first thought, too. But it was you who\npointed out to me, not so long ago, that the techniques of crime have\nchanged of late. In the new light, the swankier the brawl the greater\nthe confusion and the better the chance of getting away clean. Comb\n_that_ out of your whiskers, you red-headed mule!\"\n\n\"Well ... there might be something in it, after all ...\" Samms' thought\nshowed apprehension at last.\n\n\"You know damn well there is. But you boys--Jack and Mase\nespecially--loosen up. You can't do good shooting while you're strung\nup like a couple of cocoons. Do something--talk to your partners or\nthink at Jill ...\"\n\n\"That won't be hard, sir.\" Mason Northrop grinned feebly. \"And that\nreminds me of something, Jill. Mentor certainly bracketed the target\nwhen he--or she, or it, maybe--said that you would never need a Lens.\"\n\n\"Huh?\" Jill demanded, inelegantly. \"I don't see the connection, if any.\"\n\n\"No? Everybody else does, I'll bet. How about it?\" The other Lensmen,\neven Samms, agreed enthusiastically. \"Well, do you think that any of\nthose characters, particularly Herkimer Herkimer Third, would let a\nharness bull in harness--even such a beautiful one as you--get close\nenough to him to do such a Davey the Dip act on his mind?\"\n\n\"Oh ... I never thought of that, but it's right, and I'm glad ... but\nPops, you said something about 'support in force.' Have you any idea\nhow long it will be? I _hope_ I can hold out, with you all supporting\nme, but ...\"\n\n\"You can, Jill. Two or three minutes more, at most.\"\n\n\"Support? In force? What do you mean?\" Samms snapped.\n\n\"Just that. The whole damned army,\" Kinnison replied. \"I sent Two-Star\nCommodore Alexander Clayton a thought that lifted him right out of his\nchair. Everything he's got, at full emergency blast. Armor--mark eighty\nfours--six by six extra heavies--a ninety sixty for an ambulance--full\nescort, upstairs and down--way-friskers--'copters--cruisers and big\nstuff--in short, the works. I would have run with you before this, if I\ndared; but the minute the relief party shows up, we do a flit.\"\n\n\"If you _dared_?\" Jill asked, shaken by the thought.\n\n\"Exactly, my dear. I don't dare. If they start anything we'll do our\ndamnedest, but I'm praying they won't.\"\n\nBut Kinnison's prayers--if he made any--were ignored. Jill heard a\nsharp, but very usual and insignificant sound; someone had dropped a\npencil. She felt an inconspicuous muscle twitch slightly. She saw the\nalmost imperceptible tensing of a neck-muscle which would have turned\nHerkimer's head in a certain direction if it had been allowed to act.\nHer eyes flashed along that line, searched busily for milli-seconds. A\nman was reaching unobtrusively, as though for a handkerchief. But men\nat Ambassadors' Balls do not carry blue handkerchiefs; nor does any\nfabric, however dyed, resemble at all closely the blued steel of an\nautomatic pistol.\n\nJill would have screamed, then, and pointed; but she had time to do\nneither. Through her rapport with her father the Lensmen saw everything\nthat she saw, in the instant of her seeing it. Hence five shots blasted\nout, practically as one, before the girl could scream, or point, or\neven move. She did scream, then; but since dozens of other women were\nscreaming, too, it made no difference--then.\n\nConway Costigan, trigger-nerved spacehound that he was and with years\nof gun-fighting and of hand-to-hand brawling in his log, shot first;\neven before the gunman did. It was Costigan's blinding speed that saved\nVirgil Samms' life that day; for the would-be assassin was dying, with\na heavy slug crashing through his brain, before he finished pulling the\ntrigger. The dying hand twitched upward. The bullet intended for Samms'\nheart went high; through the fleshy part of the shoulder.\n\nRoderick Kinnison, because of his age, and his son and Northrop,\nbecause of their inexperience, were a few milli-seconds slow. They,\nhowever, were aiming for the body, not for the head; and any of those\nthree resulting wounds would have been satisfactorily fatal. The man\nwent down, and stayed down.\n\nSamms staggered, but did not go down until the elder Kinnison, as\ngently as was consistent with the maximum of speed, threw him down.\n\n\"Stand back! Get back! Give him air!\" Men began to shout, the while\npressing closer themselves.\n\n\"You men, stand back. Some of you go get a stretcher. You women, come\nhere.\" Kinnison's heavy, parade-ground voice smashed down all lesser\nnoises. \"Is there a doctor here?\"\n\nThere was; and, after being \"frisked\" for weapons, he went busily to\nwork.\n\n\"Joy--Betty--Jill--Clio,\" Kinnison called his own wife and their\ndaughter, Virgilia Samms, and Mrs. Costigan. \"You four first. Now\nyou--and you--and you--and you....\" he went on, pointing out large,\nheavy women wearing extremely extreme gowns, \"Stand here, right over\nhim. Cover him up, so that nobody else can get a shot at him. You other\nwomen, stand behind and between these--closer yet--fill those spaces\nup solid--there! Jack, stand there. Mase, there. Costigan, the other\nend; I'll take this one. Now, everybody, listen. I know damn well that\nnone of you women are wearing guns above the waist, and you've all got\nlong skirts--thank God for ballgowns! Now, fellows, if any one of these\nwomen makes a move to lift her skirt, blow her brains out, right then,\nwithout waiting to ask questions.\"\n\n\"Sir, I protest! This is outrageous!\" one of the dowagers exclaimed.\n\n\"Madam, I agree with you fully. It is.\" Kinnison smiled as genuinely\nas he could under the circumstances. \"It is, however, _necessary_. I\nwill apologize to all you ladies, and to you, doctor--in writing if you\nlike--after we have Virgil Samms aboard the _Chicago_; but until then I\nwould not trust my own grandmother.\"\n\nThe doctor looked up. \"The _Chicago_? This wound does not appear to be\na very serious one, but this man is going to a hospital at once. Ah,\nthe stretcher. So ... please ... easy ... there, that is excellent.\nCall an ambulance, please, immediately.\"\n\n\"I did. Long ago. But no hospital, doctor. All those windows--open\nto the public--or the whole place bombed--by no means. I'm taking no\nchances whatever.\"\n\n\"Except with your own life!\" Jill put in sharply, looking up from her\nplace at her father's side. Assured that the First Lensman was in no\ndanger of dying, she had begun to take interest in other things. \"You\nare important, too, you know, and you're standing right out there in\nthe open. Get another stretcher, lie down on it, and we'll guard you,\ntoo ... and don't be too stiff-necked to take your own advice!\" she\nflared, as he hesitated.\n\n\"I'm not, if it were necessary, but it isn't. If they had killed him,\nyes. I'd probably be next in line. But since he got only a scratch,\nthere'd be no point at all in killing even a _good_ Number Two.\"\n\n\"A _scratch_!\" Jill fairly seethed. \"Do you call that horrible wound a\n_scratch_?\"\n\n\"Huh? Why, certainly--that's all it is--thanks to you,\" he returned,\nin honest and complete surprise. \"No bones shattered--no main arteries\ncut--missed the lung--he'll be as good as new in a couple of weeks.\"\n\n\"And now,\" he went on aloud, \"if you ladies will please pick up this\nstretcher we will move en masse, and _slowly_, toward the door.\"\n\nThe women, no longer indignant but apparently enjoying the sensation of\nbeing the center of interest, complied with the request.\n\n\"Now, boys,\" Kinnison Lensed a thought. \"Did any of you--Costigan?--see\nany signs of a concerted rush, such as there would have been to get the\nkiller away if we hadn't interfered?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" came Costigan's brisk reply. \"None within sight of me.\"\n\n\"Jack and Mase--I don't suppose you looked?\"\n\nThey hadn't--had not thought of it in time.\n\n\"You'll learn. It takes a few things like this to make it automatic.\nBut I couldn't see any, either, so I'm fairly certain there wasn't any.\nSmart operators--quick on the uptake.\"\n\n\"I'd better get at this, sir, don't you think, and let Operation\nBoskone go for a while?\" Costigan asked.\n\n\"I don't think so.\" Kinnison frowned in thought. \"This operation was\n_planned_, son, by people with brains. Any clues you could find now\nwould undoubtedly be plants. No, we'll let the regulars look; we'll\nstick to our own ...\"\n\nSirens wailed and screamed outside. Kinnison sent out an exploring\nthought.\n\n\"Alex?\"\n\n\"Yes. Where do you want this ninety-sixty with the doctors and nurses?\nIt's too wide for the gates.\"\n\n\"Go through the wall. Across the lawn. Right up to the door, and never\nmind the frippery they've got all over the place--have your adjutant\ntell them to bill us for damage. Samms is shot in the shoulder. Not too\nserious, but I'm taking him to the Hill, where I know he'll be safe.\nWhat have you got on top of the umbrella, the _Boise_ or the _Chicago_?\nI haven't had time to look up yet.\"\n\n\"Both.\"\n\n\"Good man.\"\n\nJack Kinnison started at the monstrous tank, which was smashing\nstatues, fountains, and ornamental trees flat into the earth as it\nmoved ponderously across the grounds, and licked his lips. He looked\nat the companies of soldiers \"frisking\" the route, the grounds, and\nthe crowd--higher up, at the hovering helicopters--still higher,\nat the eight light cruisers so evidently and so viciously ready to\nblast--higher still, at the long streamers of fire which, he now knew,\nmarked the locations of the two most powerful engines of destruction\never built by man--and his face turned slowly white.\n\n\"Good Lord, Dad!\" he swallowed twice. \"I had no idea ... but they\nmight, at that.\"\n\n\"Not 'might', son. They damn well would, if they could get here soon\nenough with heavy enough stuff.\" The elder Kinnison's jaw-muscles\ndid not loosen, his darting eyes did not relax their vigilance for\na fraction of a second as he Lensed the thought. \"You boys can't be\nexpected to know it all, but right now you're learning fast. Get\nthis--paste it in your iron hats. _Virgil Samms' life is the most\nimportant thing in this whole damned universe!_ If they had got him\nthen it would not, strictly speaking, have been my fault, but if they\nget him now, it will be.\"\n\nThe land cruiser crunched to a stop against the very entrance, and a\nwhite-clad man leaped out.\n\n\"Let me look at him, please...\"\n\n\"Not yet!\" Kinnison denied, sharply. \"Not until he's got four inches\nof solid steel between him and whoever wants to finish the job they\nstarted. Get your men around him, and get him aboard--fast!\"\n\nSamms, protected at every point at every instant, was lifted into the\nmaw of the ninety-sixty; and as the massive door clanged shut Kinnison\nheaved a tremendous sigh of relief. The cavalcade moved away.\n\n\"Coming with us, Rod?\" Commodore Clayton shouted.\n\n\"Yes, but got a couple minutes' work here yet. Have a staff car wait\nfor me, and I'll join you.\" He turned to the three young Lensmen and\nthe girl. \"This fouls up our plans a little, but not too much--I\nhope. No change in Mateese or Boskone; you and Costigan, Jill, can go\nahead as planned. Northrop, you'll have to brief Jill on Zwilnik and\nfind out what she knows. Virgil was going to do it tonight, after the\nbrawl here, but you know as much about it now as any of us. Check with\nKnobos, DalNalten, and Fletcher--while Virgil is laid up you and Jack\nmay have to work on both Zabriska and Zwilnik--he'll Lens you. Get the\ndope, then do as you think best. Get going!\" He strode away toward the\nwaiting staff-car.\n\n\"Boskone? Zwilnik?\" Jill demanded. \"What gives? What are they, Jack?\"\n\n\"We don't know yet--maybe we're going to name a couple of planets...\"\n\n\"Piffle!\" she scoffed. \"Can _you_ talk sense, Mase? What's Boskone?\"\n\n\"A simple, distinctive, pronounceable coined word; suggested, I\nbelieve, by Dr. Bergenholm ...\" he began.\n\n\"You know what I mean, you ...\" she broke in, but was silenced by a\nsharply Lensed thought from Jack. His touch was very light, barely\nsufficient to make conversation possible; but even so, she flinched.\n\n\"Use your brain, Jill; you aren't thinking a lick--not that you can be\nblamed for it. Stop talking; there may be lip-readers or high-powered\nlisteners around. This feels funny, doesn't it?\" He twitched mentally\nand went on: \"You already know what Operation Mateese is, since it's\nyour own dish--politics. Operation Zwilnik is drugs, vice, and so on.\nOperation Boskone is pirates; Spud is running that. Operation Zabriska\nis Mase and me checking some peculiar disturbances in the sub-ether.\nCome in, Mase, and do your stuff--I'll see you later, aboard. Clear\nether, Jill!\"\n\nYoung Kinnison vanished from the fringes of her mind and Northrop\nappeared. And what a difference! His mind touched hers as gingerly as\nJack's had done; as skittishly, as instantaneously ready to bolt away\nfrom anything in the least degree private. However, Jack's mind had\nrubbed hers the wrong way, right from the start--and Mase's didn't!\n\n\"Now, about this Operation Zwilnik,\" Jill began.\n\n\"Something else first. I couldn't help noticing, back there, that you\nand Jack ... well, not out of phase, exactly, or really out of sync,\nbut sort of ... well, as though ...\"\n\n\"'Hunting'?\" she suggested.\n\n\"Not exactly ... 'forcing' might be better--like holding a tight beam\ntogether when it wants to fall apart. So you noticed it yourself?\"\n\n\"Of course, but I thought Jack and I were the only ones who did. Like\nscratching a blackboard with your finger-nails--you _can_ do it, but\nyou're awfully glad to stop ... and I _like_ Jack, too, darn it--at a\ndistance.\"\n\n\"And you and I fit like precisely tuned circuits. Jack really meant it,\nthen, when he said that you ... that is, he ... I didn't quite believe\nit until now, but if ... you know, of course, what you've already done\nto me.\"\n\nJill's block went on, full strength. She arched her eyebrows and spoke\naloud--\"why, I haven't the _faintest_ idea!\"\n\n\"Of course not. That's why you're using voice. I've found out, too,\nthat I can't lie with my mind. I feel like a heel and a louse, with\nso much job ahead, but you've simply got to tell me something.\nThen--whatever you say--I'll hit the job with everything I've got. Do I\nget heaved out between planets without a space-suit, or not?\"\n\n\"I don't think so.\" Jill blushed vividly, but her voice was steady.\n\"You would rate a space-suit, and enough oxygen to reach another\nplan--another goal. And now we'd better get to work, don't you think?\"\n\n\"Yes. Thanks, Jill, a million. I know as well as you do that I was\ntalking out of turn, and how much--but I had to know.\" He breathed\ndeep. \"And that's all I ask--for now. Cut your screens.\"\n\nShe lowered her mental barriers, finding it surprisingly easy to do so\nin this case; let them down almost as far as she was in the habit of\ndoing with her father. He explained in flashing thoughts everything he\nknew of the four Operations, concluding:\n\n\"I'm not assigned to Zabriska permanently; I'll probably work with you\non Mateese after your father gets back into circulation. I'm to act\nmore as a liaison man--neither Knobos nor DalNalten knows you well\nenough to Lens you. Right?\"\n\n\"Yes, I've met Mr. Knobos only once, and have never even seen Dr.\nDalNalten.\"\n\n\"Ready to visit them, via Lens?\"\n\n\"Yes. Go ahead.\"\n\nThe two Lensmen came in. They came into his mind, not hers.\nNevertheless their thoughts, superimposed upon Northrop's, came to the\ngirl as clearly as though all four were speaking to each other face to\nface.\n\n\"What a _weird_ sensation!\" Jill exclaimed. \"Why, I never _imagined_\nanything like it!\"\n\n\"We are sorry to trouble you, Miss Samms....\" Jill was surprised anew.\nThe silent voice deep within her mind was of characteristically Martian\ntimber, but instead of the harshly guttural consonants and the hissing\nsibilants of any Martian's best efforts at English, pronunciation and\nenunciation were flawless.\n\n\"Oh, I didn't mean that. It's no trouble at all, really, I just haven't\ngot used to this telepathy yet.\"\n\n\"None of us has, to any noticeable degree. But the reason for this call\nis to ask you if you have anything new, however slight, to add to our\nvery small knowledge of Zwilnik?\"\n\n\"Very little, I'm afraid; and that little is mostly guesses,\ndeductions, and jumpings at conclusions. Father told you about the way\nI work, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes. Exact data is not to be expected. Hints, suggestions, possible\nleads, will be of inestimable value.\"\n\n\"Well, I met a very short, very fat Venerian, named Ossmen, at a party\nat the European Embassy. Do either of you know him?\"\n\n\"I know of him,\" DalNalten replied. \"A highly reputable merchant, with\nsuch large interests on Tellus that he has to spend most of his time\nhere. He is not in any one of our books ... although there is nothing\nat all surprising in that fact. Go on, please, Miss Samms.\"\n\n\"He didn't come to the party with Senator Morgan; but he came to some\nkind of an agreement with him that night, and I am pretty sure that it\nwas about thionite. That's the only new item I have.\"\n\n\"_Thionite!_\" The three Lensmen were equally surprised.\n\n\"Yes. Thionite. Definitely.\"\n\n\"How _sure_ are you of this, Miss Samms?\" Knobos asked, in deadly\nearnest.\n\n\"I am not _sure_ that this particular agreement was about thionite,\nno; but the probability is roughly nine-tenths. I _am_ sure, however,\nthat both Senator Morgan and Ossmen know a lot about thionite that they\nwant to hide. Both gave very high positive reactions--well beyond the\nsix-sigma point of virtual certainty.\"\n\nThere was a pause, broken by the Martian, but not by a thought directed\nat any one of the three.\n\n\"Sid!\" he called, and even Jill could feel the Lensed thought speed.\n\n\"Yes, Knobos? Fletcher.\"\n\n\"That haul-in you made, out in the asteroids. Heroin, hadive, and\nladolian, wasn't it? No thionite involved anywhere?\"\n\n\"No thionite. However, you must remember that part of the gang got\naway, so all I can say positively is that we didn't see, or hear about,\nany thionite. There was some gossip, of course: but you know there\nalways is.\"\n\n\"Of course. Thanks, Sid.\" Jill could feel the brilliant Martian's\nmental gears whirl and click. Then he went into such a flashing\nexchange of thought with the Venerian that the girl lost track in\nseconds.\n\n\"One more question, Miss Samms?\" DalNalten asked. \"Have you detected\nany indications that there may be some connection between either Ossmen\nor Morgan and any officer or executive of Interstellar Spaceways?\"\n\n\"_Spaceways!_ Isaacson?\" Jill caught her breath. \"Why ... nobody even\nthought of such a thing--at least, nobody ever mentioned it to me--I\nnever thought of making any such tests.\"\n\n\"The possibility occurred to me only a moment ago, at your mention of\nthionite. The connection, if any exists, will be exceedingly difficult\nto trace. But since most, if not all, of the parties involved will\nprobably be included in your Operation Mateese, and since a finding,\neither positive or negative, would be tremendously significant, we feel\nemboldened to ask you to keep this point in mind.\"\n\n\"Why, of course I will. I'll be very glad to.\"\n\n\"We thank you for your courtesy and your help. One or both of us will\nget in touch with you from time to time, now that we know the pattern\nof your personality. May immortal Grolossen speed the healing of your\nfather's wound.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\n\nLate that night--or, rather, very early the following morning--Senator\nMorgan and his Number One secretary were closeted in the former's\ndoubly spy-ray-proofed office. Morgan's round, heavy, florid face had\nperhaps lost a little of its usual color; the fingers of his left hand\ndrummed soundlessly upon the glass top of his desk. His shrewd gray\neyes, however, were as keen and as calculating as ever.\n\n\"This thing smells, Herkimer ... it _reeks_ ... but I can't figure\nany of the angles. That operation was _planned_. Sure fire, it\n_couldn't_ miss. Right up to the last split second it worked perfectly.\nThen--blooie! A flat bust. The Patrol landed and everything was under\ncontrol. There _must_ have been a leak somewhere--but where in hell\ncould it have been?\"\n\n\"There couldn't have been a leak, Chief; it doesn't make sense.\"\nThe secretary uncrossed his long legs, recrossed them in the other\ndirection, threw away a half-smoked cigarette, lit another. \"If there'd\nbeen any kind of a leak they would have done a lot more than just\nkill the low man on the ladder. You know as well as I do that Rocky\nKinnison is the hardest-boiled character this side of hell. If he had\nknown anything, he would have killed everybody in sight, including you\nand me. Besides, if there had been a leak, he would not have let Samms\nget within ten thousand miles of the place--that's one sure thing.\nAnother is he wouldn't have waited until after it was all over to get\nhis army there. No, Chief, there couldn't have been a leak. Whatever\nSamms or Kinnison found out--probably Samms, he's a hell of a lot\nsmarter than Kinnison is, you know--he learned right there and then. He\nmust have seen Brainerd start to pull his gun.\"\n\n\"I thought of that. I'd buy it, except for one fact. Apparently you\ndidn't time the interval between the shots and the arrival of the\ntanks.\"\n\n\"Sorry, Chief.\" Herkimer's face was a study in chagrin. \"I made a bad\nslip there.\"\n\n\"I'll say you did. One minute and fifty eight seconds.\"\n\n\"_What!_\"\n\nMorgan remained silent.\n\n\"The patrol is fast, of course ... and always ready ... and they would\nyank the stuff in on tractor beams, not under their own power ... but\neven so ... five minutes, is my guess, Chief. Four and a half, absolute\nminimum.\"\n\n\"Check. And where do you go from there?\"\n\n\"I see your point. I don't. That blows everything wide open. One set of\nfacts says there was a leak, which occurred between two and a half and\nthree minutes before the signal was given. I ask you, Chief, does that\nmake sense?\"\n\n\"No. That's what is bothering me. As you say, the facts seem to be\ncontradictory. Somebody must have learned something before anything\nhappened; but if they did, why didn't they do more? And Murgatroyd.\nIf they didn't know about him, why the ships--especially the big\nbattlewagons? If they did think he might be out there somewhere, why\ndidn't they go and find out?\"\n\n\"Now I'll ask one. Why didn't our Mr. Murgatroyd do something? Or\nwasn't the pirate fleet supposed to be in on this? Probably not,\nthough.\"\n\n\"My guess would be the same as yours. Can't see any reason for having\na fleet cover a one-man operation, especially as well-planned a one as\nthis was. But that's none of our business. These Lensmen are. I was\nwatching them every second. Neither Samms nor Kinnison did anything\nwhatever during that two minutes.\"\n\n\"Young Kinnison and Northrop each left the hall about that time.\"\n\n\"I know it. So they did. Either one of them _could_ have called the\nPatrol--but what has that to do with the price of beef C. I. F.\nValeria?\"\n\nHerkimer refrained tactfully from answering the savage question. Morgan\ndrummed and thought for minutes, then went on slowly:\n\n\"There are two, and only two, possibilities; neither of which seem even\nremotely possible. It was--_must_ have been--either the Lens or the\ngirl.\"\n\n\"The girl? Act your age, Senator. I knew where _she_ was, and what she\nwas doing, every second.\"\n\n\"That was evident.\" Morgan stopped drumming and smiled cynically. \"I'm\ngetting a hell of a kick out of seeing you taking it, for a change,\ninstead of dishing it out.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" Herkimer's handsome face hardened. \"That game isn't over, my\nfriend.\"\n\n\"That's what _you_ think,\" the Senator jibed. \"Can't believe that any\nwoman _can_ be Herkimer-proof, eh? You've been working on her for six\nweeks now, instead of the usual six hours, and you haven't got anywhere\nyet.\"\n\n\"I will, Senator.\" Herkimer's nostrils flared viciously. \"I'll get her,\none way or another, if it's the last thing I ever do.\"\n\n\"I'll give you eight to five you don't; and a six-month time limit.\"\n\n\"I'll take five thousand of that. But what makes you think that she's\nanything to be afraid of? She's a trained psychologist, yes; but so am\nI; and I'm older and more experienced than she is. That leaves that\nyoga stuff--her learning how to sit cross-legged, how to contemplate\nher navel, and how to try to get in tune with the infinite. How do you\nfigure _that_ puts her in my class?\"\n\n\"I told you, I don't. Nothing makes sense. But she is Virgil Samms'\ndaughter.\"\n\n\"What of it? You didn't gag on George Olmstead--you picked him yourself\nfor one of the toughest jobs we've got. By blood he's just about as\nclose to Virgil Samms as Virgilia is. They might as well have been\nhatched out of the same egg.\"\n\n\"Physically, yes. Mentally and psychologically, no. Olmstead is a\nrealist, a materialist. He wants his reward in this world, not the\nnext, and is out to get it. Furthermore, the job will probably kill\nhim, and even if it doesn't, he will never be in a position of trust\nor where he can learn much of anything. On the other hand, Virgil Samms\nis--but I don't need to tell you what _he_ is like. But you don't seem\nto realize that she's just like him--she isn't playing around with you\nbecause of your overpowering charm....\"\n\n\"Listen, Chief. She didn't know anything and she didn't do anything. I\nwas dancing with her all the time, as close as that,\" he clasped his\nhands tightly together, \"so I know what I'm talking about. And if you\nthink she could _ever_ learn anything from me, skip it. You know that\nnobody on Earth, or anywhere else, can read my face; and besides, she\nwas playing coy right then--wasn't even looking at me. So count her\nout.\"\n\n\"We'll have to, I guess.\" Morgan resumed his quiet drumming. \"If there\nwere any possibility that she pumped you I'd send you to the mines, but\nthere's no sign ... that leaves the Lens. It has seemed, right along,\nmore logical than the girl--but a lot more fantastic. Been able to find\nout anything more about it?\"\n\n\"No. Just what they've been advertising. Combination radio-phone,\nautomatic language-converter, telepath, and so on. Badge of the top\nskimmings of the top-bracket cops. But I began to think, out there on\nthe floor, that they aren't advertising everything they know.\"\n\n\"So did I. You tell me.\"\n\n\"Take the time zero minus three minutes. Besides the five Lensmen--and\nJill Samms--the place was full of top brass; scrambled eggs all over\nthe floor. Commodores and lieutenant-Commodores from all continental\ngovernments of the Earth, the other planets, and the colonies, all\nwearing full-dress side-arms. Nobody knew anything then; we agree on\nthat. But within the next few seconds, somebody found out something\nand called for help. One of the Lensmen could possibly have done that\nwithout showing signs. BUT--at zero time all four Lensmen had their\nguns out--and _not_ Lewistons, please note--and were shooting; whereas\nnone of the other armed officers knew that anything was going on until\nafter it was all over. That puts the finger on the Lens.\"\n\n\"That's the way I figured it. But the difficulties remain unchanged.\n_How?_ Mind-reading?\"\n\n\"Space-drift!\" Herkimer snorted. \"My mind can't be read.\"\n\n\"Nor mine.\"\n\n\"And besides, if they could read minds, they wouldn't have waited\nuntil the last possible split second to do it, unless ... say, wait a\nminute!... Did Brainerd act or look nervous, toward the last? I wasn't\nto look at him, you know.\"\n\n\"Not nervous, exactly; but he did get a little tense.\"\n\n\"There you are, then. Hired murderers aren't smart. A Lensman saw\nhim tighten up and got suspicious. Turned in the alarm on general\nprinciples. Warned the others to keep on their toes. But even so, it\ndoesn't look like mind-reading--they'd have killed him sooner. They\nwere watchful, and mighty quick on the draw.\"\n\n\"That could be it. That's about as thin and as specious an explanation\nas I ever saw cooked up, but it _does_ cover the facts ... and the two\nof us will be able to make it stick ... but take notice, pretty boy,\nthat certain parties are not going to like this at all. In fact, they\nare going to be very highly put out.\"\n\n\"That's a nice hunk of understatement, boss. But notice one beautiful\nthing about this story?\" Herkimer grinned maliciously. \"It lets us pass\nthe buck to Big Jim Towne. We can be--and will be--sore as hell because\nhe picks such weak-sister characters to do his killings!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the heavily armored improvised ambulance, Virgil Samms sat up and\ndirected a thought at his friend Kinnison, finding his mind a turmoil\nof confusion.\n\n\"What's the matter, Rod?\"\n\n\"Plenty!\" the big Lensman snapped back. \"They were--maybe still\nare--too damn far ahead of us. Something has been going on that we\nhaven't even suspected. I stood by, as innocent as a three-year-old\ngirl baby, and let you walk right into that one--and I emphatically\ndo not enjoy getting caught with my pants down that way. It makes me\njumpy. This may be all, but it may not be--not by eleven thousand\nlight-years--and I'm trying to dope out what is going to happen next.\"\n\n\"And what have you deduced?\"\n\n\"Nothing. I'm stuck. So I'm tossing it into your lap. Besides, that's\nwhat you are getting paid for, thinking. So go ahead and think. What\nwould you be doing, if you were on the other side?\"\n\n\"I see. You think, then, that it might not be good technique to take\nthe time to go back to the spaceport?\"\n\n\"You get the idea. But--can you stand transfer?\"\n\n\"Certainly. They got my shoulder dressed and taped, and my arm in a\nsling. Shock practically all gone. Some pain, but not much. I can walk\nwithout falling down.\"\n\n\"Fair enough. Clayton!\" He Lensed a vigorous thought. \"Have any of the\nobservers spotted anything, high up or far off?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Good. Kinnison to Commodore Clayton, orders. Have a 'copter come down\nand pick up Samms and myself on tractors. Instruct the _Boise_ and\nthe cruisers to maintain utmost vigilance. Instruct the _Chicago_ to\npick us up. Detach the _Chicago_ and the _Boise_ from your task force.\nAssign them to me. Off.\"\n\n\"Clayton to Commissioner Kinnison. Orders received and are being\ncarried out. Off.\"\n\nThe transfers were made without incident. The two super-dreadnaughts\nleaped into the high stratosphere and tore westward. Half-way to the\nHill, Kinnison called Dr. Frederick Rodebush.\n\n\"Fred? Kinnison. Have Cleve and Bergenholm link up with us. Now--how\nare the Geigers on the outside of the Hill behaving?\"\n\n\"Normal, all of them,\" the physicist-Lensman reported after a moment.\n\"Why?\"\n\nKinnison detailed the happenings of the recent past. \"So tell the boys\nto unlimber all the stuff the Hill has got.\"\n\n\"My God!\" Cleveland exclaimed. \"Why, that's putting us back to the days\nof the Interplanetary Wars!\"\n\n\"With one notable exception,\" Kinnison pointed out. \"The attack, if\nany, will be strictly modern. I hope we'll be able to handle it. One\ngood thing, the old mountain's got a lot of sheer mass. How much\nradioactivity will it stand?\"\n\n\"Allotropic iron, U-235, or plutonium?\" Rodebush seized his slide-rule.\n\n\"What difference does it make?\"\n\n\"From a practical standpoint ... perhaps none. But with a task force\ndefending, not many bombs could get through, so I'd say ...\"\n\n\"I wasn't thinking so much of bombs.\"\n\n\"What, then?\"\n\n\"Isotopes. A good, thick blanket of dust. Slow-speed, fine stuff that\nneither our ships nor the Hill's screens could handle. We've got to\ndecide, first, whether Virgil will be safer there in the Hill or out in\nspace in the _Chicago_; and second, for how long.\"\n\n\"I see ... I'd say here, _under_ the Hill. Months, perhaps years,\nbefore anything could work down this far. And we can _always_ get out.\nNo matter how hot the surface gets, we've got enough screen, heavy\nwater, cadmium, lead, mercury, and everything else necessary to get him\nout through the locks.\"\n\n\"That's what I was hoping you'd say. And now, about the defense ...\nI wonder ... I don't want everybody to think I've gone completely\nhysterical, but I'll be damned if I want to get caught again with....\"\nHis thought faded out.\n\n\"May I offer a suggestion, sir?\" Bergenholm's thought broke the\nprolonged silence.\n\n\"I'd be very glad to have it--your suggestions so far haven't been idle\nvaporings. Another hunch?\"\n\n\"No, sir, a logical procedure. It has been some months since the last\nemergency call-out drill was held. If you issue such another call now,\nand nothing happens, it can be simply another surprise drill; with\ncredit, promotion, and monetary awards for the best performances;\nfurther practice and instruction for the less proficient units.\"\n\n\"Splendid, Dr. Bergenholm!\" Samms' brilliant and agile mind snatched\nup the thought and carried it along. \"And what a chance, Rod, for\nsomething vastly larger and more important than a Continental, or even\na Tellurian, drill--make it the first maneuver of the Galactic Patrol!\"\n\n\"I'd like to, Virge, but we can't. My boys are ready, but you aren't.\nNo top appointments and no authority.\"\n\n\"That can be arranged in a very few minutes. We have been waiting for\nthe psychological moment. This, especially if trouble should develop,\nis the time. You yourself expect an attack, do you not?\"\n\n\"Yes. I would not start anything unless and until I was ready to finish\nit, and I see no reason for assuming that whoever it was that tried to\nkill you is not at least as good a planner as I am.\"\n\n\"And the rest of you...? Dr. Bergenholm?\"\n\n\"My reasoning, while it does not exactly parallel that of Commissioner\nKinnison, leads to the same conclusion; that an attack in great force\nis to be expected.\"\n\n\"Not _exactly_ parallel?\" Kinnison demanded. \"In what respects?\"\n\n\"You do not seem to have considered the possibility, Commissioner, that\nthe proposed assassination of First Lensman Samms could very well have\nbeen only the first step in a comprehensive operation.\"\n\n\"I didn't ... and it _could_ have been. So go ahead, Virge, with....\"\n\nThe thought was never finished, for Samms had already gone ahead.\nSimultaneously, it seemed, the minds of eight other Lensmen joined\nthe group of Tellurians. Samms, intensely serious, spoke aloud to his\nfriend:\n\n\"The Galactic Council is now assembled. Do you, Roderick K. Kinnison,\npromise to uphold, in as much as you conscientiously can and with all\nthat in you lies, the authority of this Council throughout all space?\"\n\n\"I promise.\"\n\n\"By virtue of the authority vested in me its president by the Galactic\nCouncil, I appoint you Port Admiral of the Galactic Patrol. My fellow\ncouncillors are now inducting the armed forces of their various solar\nsystems into the Galactic Patrol ... It will not take long ... There,\nyou may make your appointments and issue orders for the mobilization.\"\n\nThe two super-dreadnaughts were now approaching the Hill. The _Boise_\nstayed \"up on top\"; the _Chicago_ went down. Kinnison, however, paid\nvery little attention to the landing or to Samms' disembarkation, and\nnone whatever to the _Chicago's_ reascent into the high heavens. He\nknew that everything was under control; and, now alone in his cabin, he\nwas busy.\n\n\"All personnel of all armed forces just inducted into the Galactic\nPatrol, attention!\" He spoke into an ultra-wave microphone, the\nfamiliar parade-ground rasp very evident in his deep and resonant\nvoice. \"Kinnison of Tellus, Port Admiral, speaking. Each of you has\ntaken oath to the Galactic Patrol?\"\n\nThey had.\n\n\"At ease. The organization chart already in your hands is made\neffective as of now. Enter in your logs the date and time. Promotions:\nCommodore Clayton of North America, Tellus....\"\n\nIn his office at New York Spaceport Clayton came to attention and\nsaluted crisply; his eyes shining, his deeply-scarred face alight.\n\n\"... to be Admiral of the First Galactic Region. Commodore Schweikert\nof Europe, Tellus ...\"\n\nIn Berlin a narrow-waisted, almost foppish-seeming man, with roached\nblond hair and blue eyes, bowed stiffly from the waist and saluted\npunctiliously.\n\n\"... to be Lieutenant-Admiral of the First Galactic Region.\"\n\nAnd so on, down the list. A marshal and a lieutenant-marshal of the\nSolarian System; a general and a lieutenant-general of the planet Sol\nThree. Promotions, agreed upon long since, to fill the high offices\nthus vacated. Then the list of commodores upon other planets--Guindlos\nof Redland, Mars; Sesseffsen of Talleron, Venus; Raymond of the Jovian\nSub-System; Newman of Alphacent; Walters of Sirius; van-Meeter of\nValeria; Adams of Procyon; Roberts of Altair; Barrtell of Fomalhout;\nArmand of Vega; and Coigne of Aldebaran--each of whom was actually the\ncommander-in-chief of the armed forces of a world. Each of these was\nmade general of his planet.\n\n\"Except for lieutenant-commodores and up, who will tune their minds to\nme--dismissed!\" Kinnison stopped talking and went onto his Lens.\n\n\"That was for the record. I don't need to tell you, fellows, how glad\nI am to be able to do this. You're tops, all of you--I don't know of\nanybody I'd rather have at my back when the ether gets rough ...\"\n\n\"Right back at you, chief!\" \"Same to you Rod!\" \"Rocky Rod, Port\nAdmiral!\" \"Now we're blasting!\" came a melange of thoughts. Those\nsplendid men, with whom he had shared so much of danger and of stress,\nwere all as jubilant as schoolboys.\n\n\"But the thing that makes this possible may also make it necessary\nfor us to go to work; to earn your extra stars and my wheel.\"\nKinnison smothered the welter of thoughts and outlined the situation,\nconcluding: \"So you see it may turn out to be only a drill--but\non the other hand, since the outfit is big enough to have built a\nwar-fleet alone, if it wanted one, and since it may have had a lot of\nfirst-class help that none of us knows anything about, we may be in\nfor the damndest battle that any of us ever saw. So come prepared for\n_anything_. I am now going back onto voice, for the record.\n\n\"Kinnison to the commanding officers of all fleets, sub-fleets, and\ntask-forces of the Galactic Patrol. Information. Subject, tactical\nproblem; defense of the Hill against a postulated Black Fleet of\nunknown size, strength, and composition; of unknown nationality or\norigin; coming from an unknown direction in space at an unknown time.\n\n\"Kinnison to Admiral Clayton. Orders. Take over. I am relinquishing\ncommand of the _Boise_ and the _Chicago_.\"\n\n\"Clayton to Port Admiral Kinnison. Orders received. Taking over. I\nam at the _Chicago's_ main starboard lock. I have instructed Ensign\nMasterson, the commanding officer of this gig, to wait; that he is to\ntake you down to the Hill.\"\n\n\"WHAT? Of all the damned....\" This was a thought, and unrecorded.\n\n\"Sorry, Rod--I'm sorry as hell, and I'd like no end to have you along.\"\nThis, too, was a thought. \"But that's the way it is. Ordinary Admirals\nride the ether with their fleets. Port Admirals stay aground. I report\nto you, and you run things--in broad--by remote control.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Kinnison then Lensed a fuming thought at Samms. \"Alex\n_couldn't_ do this to me--and wouldn't--and knows damn well that I'd\nburn him to a crisp if he had the guts to try it. So it's _your_\ndoing--what in hell's the big idea?\"\n\n\"Who's being heroic now, Rod?\" Samms asked, quietly. \"Use _your_ brain.\nAnd then come down here, where you belong.\"\n\nAnd Kinnison, after a long moment of rebellious thought and with as\nmuch grace as he could muster, came down. Down not only to the Patrol's\nfamiliar offices, but down into the deepest crypts beneath them. He was\nglum enough, and bitter, at first: but he found much to do. Grand Fleet\nHeadquarters--_his_ headquarters--was being organized, and the best\nefforts of the best minds and of the best technologists of three worlds\nwere being devoted to the task of strengthening the already extremely\nstrong defenses of THE HILL. And in a very short time the plates of\nGFHQ showed that Admiral Clayton and Lieutenant-Admiral Schweikert were\ndoing a very nice job.\n\nAll of the really heavy stuff was of Earth, the Mother Planet, and\nwas already in place; as were the less numerous and much lighter\ncontingents of Mars, of Venus, and of Jove. And the fleets of the\noutlying solar systems--cutters, scouts, and a few light cruisers--were\nneither maintaining fleet formation nor laying course for Sol. Instead,\neach individual vessel was blasting at maximum for the position in\nspace in which it would form one unit of a formation englobing at a\ndistance of light-years the entire Solarian System, and each of those\nhurtling hundreds of ships was literally combing all circumambient\nspace with its furiously-driven detector beams.\n\n\"Nice.\" Kinnison turned to Samms, now beside him at the master plate.\n\"Couldn't have done any better myself.\"\n\n\"After you get it made, what are you going to do with it in case\nnothing happens?\" Samms was still somewhat skeptical. \"How long can you\nmake a drill last?\"\n\n\"Until all the ensigns have long gray whiskers if I have to, but don't\nworry--if we have time to get the preliminary globe made I'll be the\nsurprisedest man in the system.\"\n\nAnd Kinnison was not surprised; before full englobement was\naccomplished, a loud-speaker gave tongue.\n\n\"Flagship _Chicago_ to Grand Fleet Headquarters!\" it blatted, sharply.\n\"The Black Fleet has been detected. RA twelve hours, declination plus\ntwenty degrees, distance about thirty light-years....\"\n\nKinnison started to say something; then, by main force, shut himself\nup. He wanted intensely to take over, to tell the boys out there\nexactly what to do, but he couldn't. He was now a Big Shot--damn the\nluck! He could be and must be responsible for broad policy and for\ngeneral strategy, but, once those vitally important decisions had been\nmade, the actual work would have to be done by others. He didn't like\nit--but there it was. Those flashing thoughts took only an instant of\ntime.\n\n\"... which is such extreme range that no estimate of strength or\ncomposition can be made at present. We will keep you informed.\"\n\n\"Acknowledge,\" he ordered Randolph; who, wearing now the five silver\nbars of major, was his Chief Communications Officer. \"No instructions.\"\n\nHe turned to his plate. Clayton hadn't had to be told to pull in his\nlight stuff; it was all pelting hell-for-leather for Sol and Tellus.\nThree general plans of battle had been mapped out by Staff. Each\nhad its advantages--and its disadvantages. Operation Acorn--long\ndistance--would be fought at, say, twelve light-years. It would keep\neverything, particularly the big stuff, away from the Hill, and would\nmake automatics useless ... _unless_ some got past, or _unless_ the\nautomatics were coming in on a sneak course, or _unless_ several other\nthings--in any one of which cases _what_ a God-awful shellacking the\nHill would take!\n\nHe grinned wryly at Samms, who had been following his thought, and\nquoted: \"A vast hemisphere of lambent violet flame, through which\nneither material substance nor destructive ray can pass.\"\n\n\"Well, that dedicatory statement, while perhaps a bit florid, was\nstrictly true at the time--before the days of allotropic iron and of\npolycyclic drills. Now I'll quote one: 'Nothing is permanent except\nchange'.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" and Kinnison returned to his thinking. Operation Adack.\nMiddle distance. Uh-uh. He didn't like it any better now than he had\nbefore, even though some of the Big Brains of Staff thought it the\nideal solution. A compromise. All of the disadvantages of both of the\nothers, and none of the advantages of either. It _still_ stunk, and\nunless the Black fleet had an utterly fantastic composition Operation\nAdack was out.\n\nAnd Virgil Samms, quietly smoking a cigarette, smiled inwardly. Rod\nthe Rock could scarcely be expected to be in favor of any sort of\ncompromise.\n\nThat left Operation Affick. Close up. It had three tremendous\nadvantages. First, the Hill's own offensive weapons--as long as they\nlasted. Second, the new Rodebush-Bergenholm fields. Third, no sneak\nattack could be made without detection and interception. It had\none tremendous disadvantage; some stuff, and probably a lot of it,\nwould get through. Automatics, robots, guided missiles equipped with\nsuper-speed drives, with polycyclic drills, and with atomic war-heads\nstrong enough to shake the whole world.\n\nBut with those new fields, shaking the world wouldn't be enough; in\norder to get deep enough to reach Virgil Samms they would damn near\nhave to destroy the world. Could _anybody_ build a bomb that powerful?\nHe didn't think so. Earth technology was supreme throughout all known\nspace; of Earth technologists the North Americans were, and always had\nbeen, tops. Grant that the Black Fleet was, basically, North American.\nGrant further that they had a man as good as Adlington--or that they\ncould spy-ray Adlington's brain and laboratories and shops--a tall\norder. Adlington himself was several months away from a world-wrecker,\nunless he could put one a hundred miles down before detonation, which\nsimply was not feasible. He turned to Samms.\n\n\"It'll be Affick, Virge, unless they've got a composition that is\nradically different from anything I ever saw put into space.\"\n\n\"So? I can't say that I am very much surprised.\"\n\nThe calm statement and the equally calm reply were beautifully\ncharacteristic of the two men. Kinnison had not asked, nor had Samms\noffered, advice. Kinnison, after weighing the facts, made his decision.\nSamms, calmly certain that the decision was the best that could be made\nupon the data available, accepted it without question or criticism.\n\n\"We've still got a minute or two,\" Kinnison remarked. \"Don't quite know\nwhat to make of their line of approach. Coma Berenices. I don't know\nof anything at all out that way, do you? They could have detoured,\nthough.\"\n\n\"No, I don't.\" Samms frowned in thought. \"Probably a detour.\"\n\n\"Check.\" Kinnison turned to Randolph. \"Tell them to report whatever\nthey know; we can't wait any ...\"\n\nAs he was speaking the report came in.\n\nThe Black Fleet was of more or less normal make-up; considerably larger\nthan the North American contingent, but decidedly inferior to the\nPatrol's present Grand Fleet. Either three or four capital ships ...\n\n\"And we've got six!\" Kinnison said, exultantly. \"Our own two, Asia's\n_Himalaya_, Africa's _Johannesburg_, South America's _Bolivar_, and\nEurope's _Europa_.\"\n\n... Battle cruisers and heavy cruisers, about in the usual proportions;\nbut an unusually high ratio of scouts and light cruisers. There\nwere either two or three large ships which could not be classified\ndefinitely at that distance; long-range observers were going out to\nstudy them.\n\n\"Tell Clayton,\" Kinnison instructed Randolph, \"that it is to be\nOperation Affick, and for him to fly at it.\"\n\n\"Report continued,\" the speaker came to life again. \"There are three\ncapital ships, apparently of approximately the _Chicago_ class, but\ntear-drop-shaped instead of spherical ...\"\n\n\"Ouch!\" Kinnison flashed a thought at Samms. \"I don't like that. They\ncan both fight and run.\"\n\n\"... The battle cruisers are also tear-drops. The small vessels are\ntorpedo-shaped. There are three of the large ships, which we are\nstill not able to classify definitely. They are spherical in shape,\nand very large, but do not seem to be either armed or screened, and\nare apparently carriers--possibly of automatics. We are now making\ncontact--off!\"\n\nInstead of looking at the plates before them, the two Lensmen went\nen rapport with Clayton, so that they could see everything he saw.\nThe stupendous Cone of Battle had long since been formed; the word to\nfire was given in a measured two-second call. Every firing officer in\nevery Patrol ship touched his stud in the same split second. And from\nthe gargantuan mouth of the Cone there spewed a miles-thick column of\nenergy so raw, so stark, so incomprehensibly violent that it must have\nbeen seen to be even dimly appreciated. It simply cannot be described.\n\nIts prototype, Triplanetary's Cylinder of Annihilation, had been\na highly effective weapon indeed. The offensive beams of the\nfish-shaped Nevian cruisers of the void were even more powerful.\nThe Cleveland-Rodebush projectors, developed aboard the original\n_Boise_ on the long Nevian way, were stronger still. The composite\nbeam projected by this fleet of the Galactic Patrol, however, was\nthe sublimation and quintessence of each of these, redesigned and\nredesigned by scientists and engineers of ever-increasing knowledge,\nrebuilt and rebuilt by technologists of ever-increasing skill.\n\nCapital ships and a few of the heaviest cruisers could mount screen\ngenerators able to carry that frightful load; but every smaller ship\ncaught in that semi-solid rod of indescribably incandescent fury simply\nflared into nothingness.\n\nBut in the instant before the firing order was given--as though\nprecisely timed, which in all probability was the case--the\never-watchful observers picked up two items of fact which made the new\nAdmiral of the First Galactic Region cut his almost irresistible weapon\nand break up his Cone of Battle after only a few seconds of action.\nOne: those three enigmatic cargo scows had fallen apart _before_ the\nbeam reached them, and hundreds--yes, thousands--of small objects had\nhurtled radially outward, out well beyond the field of action of the\nPatrol's beam, at a speed many times that of light. Two: Kinnison's\nforebodings had been prophetic. A swarm of Blacks, all small--must have\nbeen hidden right on Earth somewhere!--were already darting at the Hill\nfrom the south.\n\n\"Cease firing!\" Clayton rapped into his microphone. The dreadful beam\nexpired. \"Break cone formation! Independent action--light cruisers and\nscouts, _get those bombs_! Heavy cruisers and battle cruisers, engage\nsimilar units of the Blacks, two to one if possible. _Chicago_ and\n_Boise_, attack Black Number One. _Bolivar_ and _Himalaya_, Number Two.\n_Europa_ and _Johannesburg_, Number Three!\"\n\nSpace was full of darting, flashing, madly warring ships. The three\nBlack super-dreadnaughts leaped forward as one. Their massed batteries\nof beams, precisely synchronized and aimed, lashed out as one at the\nnearest Patrol super heavy, the _Boise_. Under the vicious power of\nthat beautifully-timed thrust that warship's first, second, and third\nscreens, her very wall-shield, flared through the spectrum and into the\nblack. Her Chief Pilot, however, was fast--_very_ fast--and he had a\nfraction of a second in which to work. Thus, practically in the instant\nof her wall-shield's failure, she went free; and while she was holed\nbadly and put out of action, she was not blown out of space. In fact,\nit was learned later that she lost only forty men.\n\nThe Blacks were not as fortunate. The _Chicago_, now without a\npartner, joined beams with the _Bolivar_ and the _Himalaya_ against\nNumber Two; then, a short half-second later, with her other two\nsister-ships against Number Three. And in that very short space of time\ntwo Black super-dreadnaughts ceased utterly to be.\n\nBut also, in that scant second of time, Black Number One had all but\ndisappeared! Her canny commander, with no stomach at all for odds\nof five to one against, had ordered flight at max; she was already\none-sixtieth of a light-year--about one hundred thousand million\nmiles--away from the Earth and was devoting her every energy to the\naccumulation of still more distance.\n\n\"_Bolivar!_ _Himalaya!_\" Clayton barked savagely. \"Get him!\" He wanted\nintensely to join the chase, but he couldn't. He had to stay here. And\nhe didn't have time even to swear. Instead, without a break, the words\ntripping over each other against his teeth: \"_Chicago!_ _Johannesburg!_\n_Europa!_ Act at will against heaviest craft left. Blast 'em down!\"\n\nHe gritted his teeth. The scouts and light cruisers were doing their\ndamndest, but they were out-numbered three to one--Christ, what a\nlot of stuff was getting through! The Blacks wouldn't last long,\nbetween the Hill and the heavies ... but maybe long enough, at\nthat--the Patrol globe was leaking like a sieve! He voiced a couple of\nbursts of deep-space profanity and, although he was almost afraid to\nlook, sneaked a quick peek to see how much was left of the Hill. He\nlooked--and stopped swearing in the middle of a four-letter Anglo-Saxon\nword.\n\nWhat he saw simply did not make sense. Those Black bombs should have\npeeled the armor off of that mountain like the skin off of a nectarine\nand scattered it from the Pacific to the Mississippi. By now there\nshould be a hole a mile deep where the Hill had been. But there wasn't.\nThe Hill was still there! It might have shrunk a little--Clayton\ncouldn't see very well because of the worse-than-incandescent radiance\nof the practically continuous, sense-battering, world-shaking atomic\ndetonations--_but the Hill was still there_!\n\nAnd as he stared, chilled and shaken, at that indescribably terrific\nspectacle, a Black cruiser, holed and helpless, fell toward that\narmored mountain with an acceleration starkly impossible to credit.\nAnd when it struck it did not penetrate, and splash, and crater, as it\nshould have done. Instead, it simply spread out, _in a thin layer_,\nover an acre or so of the fortress' steep and apparently still armored\nsurface!\n\n\"You saw that, Alex? Good. Otherwise you could scarcely believe it,\"\ncame Kinnison's silent voice. \"Tell all our ships to stay away. There's\na force of over a hundred thousand G's acting in a direction normal to\nevery point of our surface. The boys are giving it all the decrement\nthey can--somewhere between distance cube and fourth power--but even so\nit's pretty fierce stuff. How about the _Bolivar_ and the _Himalaya_?\nNot having much luck catching Mr. Black, are they?\"\n\n\"Why, I don't know. I'll check ... No, sir, they aren't. They report\nthat they are losing ground and will soon lose trace.\"\n\n\"I was afraid so, from that shape. Rodebush was about the only one who\nsaw it coming ... well, we'll have to redesign and rebuild ...\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPort Admiral Kinnison, shortly after directing the foregoing thought,\nleaned back in his chair and smiled. The battle was practically over.\nThe Hill had come through. The Rodebush-Bergenholm fields had held\nher together through the most God-awful session of saturation atomic\nbombing that any world had ever seen or that the mind of man had ever\nconceived. And the counter-forces had kept the interior rock from\nflowing like water. So far, so good.\n\nHer original armor was gone. Converted into ... what? For hundreds of\nfeet inward from the surface she was hotter than the reacting slugs\nof the Hanfords. Delousing her would be a project, not an operation;\nmillions of cubic yards of material would have to be hauled off into\nspace with tractors and allowed to simmer for a few hundred years; but\nwhat of that?\n\nBergenholm had said that the fields would tend to prevent the\nradioactives from spreading, as they otherwise would--and _Virgil Samms\nwas still safe_!\n\n\"Virge, my boy, come along.\" He took the First Lensman by his good\narm and lifted him out of his chair. \"Old Doctor Kinnison's peerless\nprescription for you and me is a big, thick, juicy, porterhouse steak.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\n\nThat murderous attack upon Virgil Samms, and its countering by those\nnew super-lawmen, the Lensmen, and by an entire task force of the\nNorth American Armed Forces, was news of Civilization-wide importance.\nAs such, it filled every channel of Universal Telenews for an hour.\nThen, in stunning and crescendo succession, came the staccato reports\nof the creation of the Galactic Patrol, the mobilization--allegedly\nfor maneuvers--of Galactic Patrol's Grand Fleet, and the ultimately\ndesperate and all-too-nearly successful attack upon The Hill.\n\n\"Just a second, folks; we'll have it very shortly. You'll see something\nthat nobody ever saw before and that nobody will ever see again. We're\ngetting in as close as the Law will let us.\" The eyes of Telenews' ace\nreporter and the telephoto lens of his cameraman stared down from a\nscooter at the furiously smoking, sputteringly incandescent surface of\nTriplanetary's ancient citadel; while upon dozens of worlds thousands\nof millions of people packed themselves tighter and tighter around tens\nof millions of visiplates and loud-speakers in order to see and to hear\nthe tremendous news.\n\n\"There it is, folks, look at it--the only really impregnable fortress\never built by man! A good many of our experts had it written off as\nobsolete, long ago, but it seems these Lensmen had something up their\nsleeves besides their arms, heh-heh! And speaking of Lensmen, they\nhaven't been throwing their weight around, so most of us haven't\nnoticed them very much, but this reporter wants to go on record right\nnow as saying there must be a lot more to the Lens than any of us has\nthought, because otherwise nobody would have gone to all that trouble\nand expense, to say nothing of the tremendous loss of life, just to\nkill the Chief Lensman, which seems to have been what they were after.\n\n\"We told you a few minutes ago, you know, that every Continent of\nCivilization sent official messages denying most emphatically any\nconnection with this outrage. It's still a mystery, folks; in fact,\nit is getting more and more mysterious all the time. _Not one single\nman of the Black Fleet was taken alive!_ Not even in the ships that\nwere only holed--they blew themselves up! And there were no uniforms\nor books or anything of the kind to be found in any of the wrecks--no\nidentification whatever!\n\n\"And now for the scoop of all time! Universal Telenews has obtained\npermission to interview the two top Lensmen, both of whom you all\nknow--Virgil Samms and 'Rod the Rock' Kinnison--personally for this\nbeam. We are now going down, by remote control, of course, right into\nthe Galactic patrol office, right in The Hill itself. Here we are. Now\nif you will step just a little closer to the mike, please, Mr. Samms,\nor should I say...?\"\n\n\"You should say 'First Lensman Samms',\" Kinnison said bruskly.\n\n\"Oh, yes, First Lensman Samms. Thank you, Mr. Kinnison. Now, First\nLensman Samms, our clients all want to know all about the Lens. We all\nknow what it _does_, but what, really, _is_ it? Who invented it? How\ndoes it work?\"\n\nKinnison started to say something, but Samms silenced him with a\nthought.\n\n\"I will answer those questions by asking you one.\" Samms smiled\ndisarmingly. \"Do you remember what happened because the pirates learned\nto duplicate the golden meteor of the Triplanetary Service?\"\n\n\"Oh, I see.\" The Telenews ace, although brash and not at all\nthin-skinned, was quick on the uptake. \"Hush-hush? T. S.?\"\n\n\"Top Secret. Very much so,\" Samms confirmed, \"and we are going to keep\nsome things about the Lens secret as long as we possibly can.\"\n\n\"Fair enough. Sorry folks, but you will agree that they're right on\nthat. Well, then, Mr. Samms, who do you think it was that tried to kill\nyou, and where do you think the Black Fleet came from?\"\n\n\"I have no idea,\" Samms said, slowly and thoughtfully. \"No. No idea\nwhatever.\"\n\n\"What? Are you _sure_ of that? Aren't you holding back maybe just a\nlittle bit of a suspicion, for diplomatic reasons?\"\n\n\"I am holding nothing back; and through my Lens I can make you certain\nof the fact. Lensed thoughts come from the mind itself, direct, not\nthrough such voluntary muscles as the tongue. The mind does not\nlie--even such lies as you call 'diplomacy'.\"\n\nThe Lensman demonstrated and the reporter went on:\n\n\"He is _sure_, folks, which fact knocked me speechless for a second\nor two--which is quite a feat in itself. Now, Mr. Samms, one last\nquestion. What is all this Lens stuff really about? What are all\nyou Lensmen--the Galactic Council and so on--really up to? What do\nyou expect to get out of it? And why would anybody want to make\nsuch an all-out effort to get rid of you? And give it to me on the\nLens, please, if you can do it and talk at the same time--that was a\nwonderful sensation, folks, of getting the dope straight and _knowing_\nthat it was straight.\"\n\n\"I can and will answer both by voice and by Lens. Our basic purpose\nis ...\" and he quoted verbatim the resounding sentences which Mentor\nhad impressed so ineradicably upon his mind. \"You know how little\nhappiness, how little real well-being, there is upon any world today.\nWe propose to increase both. What we expect to get out of it is\nhappiness and well-being for ourselves, the satisfaction felt by any\ngood workman doing the job for which he is best fitted and in which\nhe takes pride. As to why anyone should want to kill me, the logical\nexplanation would seem to be that some group or organization or race,\nopposed to that for which we Lensmen stand, decided to do away with us\nand started with me.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Samms. I am sure that we all enjoyed this interview\nvery much. Now, folks, you all know 'Rocky Rod', 'Rod the Rock',\nKinnison ... just a little closer, please ... thank you. I don't\nsuppose you have any suspicions, either, any more than....\"\n\n\"I certainly have!\" Kinnison barked, so savagely that five hundred\nmillion people jumped as one. \"How do you want it; voice, or Lens,\nor both?\" Then on the Lens: \"Think it over, son, because _I suspect\neverybody_!\"\n\n\"Bub-both, please, Mr. Kinnison.\" Even Universal's star reporter was\nshaken by the quiet but deadly fury of the big Lensman's thought, but\nhe rallied so quickly that his hesitation was barely noticeable. \"Your\nLensed thought to me was that you suspect _everybody_, Mr. Kinnison?\"\n\n\"Just that. Everybody. I suspect every continental government of every\nworld we know, including that of North America of Tellus. I suspect\npolitical parties and organized minorities. I suspect pressure groups.\nI suspect capital and I suspect labor. I suspect an organization of\ncriminals. I suspect nations and races and worlds that no one of us\nhas as yet heard of--not even you, the top-drawer newshawk of the\nuniverse.\"\n\n\"But you have nothing concrete to go on, I take it?\"\n\n\"If I did have, do you think I'd be standing here talking to you?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFirst Lensman Samms sat in his private quarters and thought.\n\nLensman Dronvire of Rigel Four stood behind him and helped him think.\n\nPort Admiral Kinnison, with all his force and drive, began a\ncomprehensive program of investigation, consolidation, expansion,\nredesigning, and rebuilding.\n\nVirgilia Samms went to a party practically every night. She danced, she\nflirted, she talked. _How_ she talked! Meaningless small talk for the\nmost part--but interspersed with artless questions and comments which,\nwhile they perhaps did not put her partner of the moment completely at\nease, nevertheless did not quite excite suspicion.\n\nConway Costigan, Lens under sleeve, undisguised but inconspicuous, rode\nthe ether-lanes; observing minutely and reporting fully.\n\nJack Kinnison piloted and navigated and computed for his friend and\nboat-mate:\n\nMason Northrop; who, completely surrounded by breadboard hookups of new\nand ever-more-fantastic complexity, listened and looked; listened and\ntuned; listened and rebuilt; listened and--finally--took bearings and\nbearings and bearings with his ultra-sensitive loops.\n\nDalNalten and Knobos, with dozens of able helpers, combed the records\nof three worlds in a search which produced as a by-product a monumental\n\"who's who\" of crime.\n\nSkilled technicians fed millions of cards, stack by stack, into\nthe most versatile and most accomplished machines known to the\nstatisticians of the age.\n\nAnd Dr. Nels Bergenholm, abandoning temporarily his regular line of\nwork, devoted his peculiar talents to a highly abstruse research in the\nclosely allied field of organic chemistry.\n\nThe walls of Virgil Samms' quarters became covered with charts,\ndiagrams, and figures. Tabulations and condensations piled up on his\ndesk and overflowed into baskets upon the floor. Until:\n\n\"Lensman Olmstead, of Alphacent, sir,\" his secretary announced.\n\n\"Good! Send him in, please.\"\n\nThe stranger entered. The two men, after staring intently at each\nother for half a minute, smiled and shook hands vigorously. Except for\nthe fact that the newcomer's hair was brown, they were practically\nidentical!\n\n\"I'm certainly glad to see you, George. Bergenholm passed you, of\ncourse?\"\n\n\"Yes. He says that he can match your hair to mine, even the individual\nwhite ones. And he has made me a wig-maker's dream of a wig.\"\n\n\"Married?\" Samms' mind leaped ahead to possible complications.\n\n\"Widower, same as you. And....\"\n\n\"Just a minute--going over this once will be enough.\" He Lensed call\nafter call. Lensmen in various parts of space became en rapport with\nhim and thus with each other.\n\n\"Lensmen--especially you, Rod--George Olmstead is here, and his brother\nRay is available. I am going to work.\"\n\n\"I _still_ don't like it!\" Kinnison protested. \"It's too dangerous. I\ntold the Universe I was going to keep you covered, and I _meant_ it!\"\n\n\"That's what makes it perfectly safe. That is, if Bergenholm is _sure_\nthat the duplication is close enough ...\"\n\n\"I am sure.\" Bergenholm's deeply resonant pseudo-voice left no doubt\nat all in any one of the linked minds. \"The substitution will not be\ndetected.\"\n\n\"... and that nobody knows, George, or even suspects, that you got your\nLens.\"\n\n\"I am sure of that.\" Olmstead laughed quietly. \"Also, nobody except us\nand your secretary knows that I am here. For a good many years I have\nmade a specialty of that sort of thing. Photos, fingerprints, and so on\nhave all been taken care of.\"\n\n\"Good. I simply can not work efficiently here,\" Samms expressed\nwhat all knew to be the simple truth. \"Dronvire is a much better\nanalyst-synthesist than I am; as soon as any significant correlation\nis possible he will know it. We have learned that the Towne-Morgan\ncrowd, Mackenzie Power, Ossmen Industries, and Interstellar\nSpaceways are all tied in together, and that thionite is involved,\nbut we have not been able to get any further. There is a slight\ncorrelation--barely significant--between deaths from thionite and\nthe arrival in the Solarian System of certain Spaceways liners. The\nfact that certain officials of the Earth-Screen Service have been and\nare spending considerably more than they earn sets up a slight but\ndefinite probability that they are allowing space-ships or boats from\nspace-ships to land illegally. These smugglers carry contraband, which\nmay or may not be thionite. In short, we lack fundamental data in every\ndepartment, and it is high time for me to begin doing my share in\ngetting it.\"\n\n\"I don't check you, Virge.\" None of the Kinnisons ever did give\nup without a struggle. \"Olmstead is a mighty smooth worker,\nand you are our prime coordinator. Why not let him keep up the\ncounter-espionage--do the job you were figuring on doing yourself--and\nyou stay here and boss it?\"\n\n\"I have thought of that, a great deal, and have....\"\n\n\"Because Olmstead can not do it,\" a hitherto silent mind cut in,\ndecisively. \"I, Rularion of North Polar Jupiter, say so. There are\npsychological factors involved. The ability to separate and to evaluate\nthe constituent elements of a complex situation; the ability to make\ncorrect decisions without hesitation; as well as many others not\nas susceptible to concise statement, but which collectively could\nbe called power of mind. How say you, Bergenholm of Tellus? For I\nhave perceived in you a mind approximating in some respects the\nphilosophical and psychological depth of my own.\" This outrageously\negotistical declaration was, to the Jovian, a simple statement of an\nequally simple truth, and Bergenholm accepted it as such.\n\n\"I agree. Olmstead probably could not succeed.\"\n\n\"Well, then, can Samms?\" Kinnison demanded.\n\n\"Who knows?\" came Bergenholm's mental shrug, and simultaneously:\n\n\"Nobody knows whether I can or not, but I am going to try,\" and Samms\nended--almost--the argument by asking Bergenholm and a couple of other\nLensmen to come into his office and by taking off his Lens.\n\n\"And that's another thing I don't like.\" Kinnison offered one last\nobjection. \"Without your Lens, _anything_ can happen to you.\"\n\n\"Oh, I won't have to be without it very long. And besides,\nVirgilia isn't the only one in the Samms family who can work\nbetter--sometimes--without a Lens.\"\n\nThe Lensmen came in and, in a surprisingly short time, went out. A few\nminutes later, two Lensmen strolled out of Samms' inner office into\nthe outer one.\n\n\"Good-bye, George,\" the red-headed man said aloud, \"and good luck.\"\n\n\"Same to you, Chief,\" and the brown-haired one strode out.\n\nNorma the secretary was a smart girl, and observant. In her position,\nshe had to be. Her eyes followed the man out, then scanned the Lensman\nfrom toe to crown.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like it, Mr. Samms,\" she remarked then.\n\"Except for the difference in coloring, and a sort of ... well,\nstoopiness ... he could be your identical twin. You two must have had a\ncommon ancestor--or several--not too far back, didn't you?\"\n\n\"We certainly did. Quadruple second cousins, you might call it. We have\nknown of each other for years, but this is the first time we have met.\"\n\n\"Quadruple second cousins? What does that mean? How come?\"\n\n\"Well, say that once upon a time there were two men named Albert and\nChester....\"\n\n\"What? Not two Irishmen named Pat and Mike? You're slipping, boss.\" The\ngirl smiled roguishly. During rush hours she was always the fast, cool,\nefficient secretary, but in moments of ease such persiflage as this was\nthe usual thing in the First Lensman's private office. \"Not at all up\nto your usual form.\"\n\n\"Merely because I am speaking now as a genealogist, not as a raconteur.\nBut to continue, we will say that Chester and Albert had four children\napiece, two boys and two girls, two pairs of identical twins, each. And\nwhen they grew up--half way up, that is....\"\n\n\"Don't tell me that we are going to suppose that all those identical\ntwins married each other?\"\n\n\"Exactly. Why not?\"\n\n\"Well, it would be stretching the laws of probability all out of shape.\nBut go ahead--I can see what's coming, I think.\"\n\n\"Each of those couples had one, and only one, child. We will call those\nchildren Jim Samms and Sally Olmstead; John Olmstead and Irene Samms.\"\n\nThe girl's levity disappeared. \"James Alexander Samms and Sarah\nOlmstead Samms. Your parents. I didn't see what was coming, after all.\nThis George Olmstead; then, is your....\"\n\n\"Whatever it is, yes. I can't name it, either--maybe you had better\ncall Genealogy some day and find out. But it's no wonder we look alike.\nAnd there are three of us, not two--George has an identical twin\nbrother.\"\n\nThe red-haired Lensman stepped back into the inner office, shut the\ndoor, and Lensed a thought at Virgil Samms.\n\n\"It worked, Virgil! I talked to her for five solid minutes, practically\nleaning on her desk, and she didn't tumble! And if this wig of\nBergenholm's fooled _her_ so completely, the job he did on you would\nfool _anybody_!\"\n\n\"Fine! I've done a little testing myself, on the keenest men I know,\nwithout a trace of recognition so far.\"\n\nHis last lingering doubt resolved, Samms boarded the ponderous,\nradiation-proof, neutron-proof shuttle-scow which was the only possible\nmeans of entering or leaving the Hill. A fast cruiser whisked him\nto Nampa, where Olmstead's \"accidentally\" damaged transcontinental\ntransport was being repaired, and from which city Olmstead had been\ngone so briefly that no one had missed him. He occupied Olmstead's\nspace; he surrendered the remainder of Olmstead's ticket. He reached\nNew York. He took a 'copter to Senator Morgan's office. He was escorted\ninto the private office of Herkimer Herkimer Third.\n\n\"Olmstead. Of Alphacent.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" Herkimer's hand moved, ever so little, upon his desk's top.\n\n\"Here.\" The Lensman dropped an envelope upon the desk in such fashion\nthat it came to rest within an inch of the hand.\n\n\"Prints. Here.\" Samms made prints. \"Wash your hands, over there.\"\nHerkimer pressed a button. \"Check all these prints, against each other\nand the files. Check the two halves of the torn sheet, fiber to fiber.\"\nHe turned to the Lensless Lensman, now standing quietly before his\ndesk. \"Routine; a formality, in your case, but necessary.\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\nThen for long seconds the two hard men stared into the hard depths of\neach other's eyes.\n\n\"You may do, Olmstead. We have had very good reports of you. But you\nhave never been in thionite?\"\n\n\"No. I have never even seen any.\"\n\n\"What do you want to get into it for?\"\n\n\"Your scouts sounded me out; what did they tell you? The usual\nthing--promotion from the ranks into the brass--to get to where I can\ndo myself and the organization some good.\"\n\n\"Yourself first, the organization second?\"\n\n\"What else? Why should I be different from the rest of you?\"\n\nThis time the locked eyes held longer; one pair smoldering, the other\ngold-flecked, tawny ice.\n\n\"Why, indeed?\" Herkimer smiled thinly. \"We do not advertise it,\nhowever.\"\n\n\"Outside, I wouldn't, either; but here I'm laying my cards flat on the\ntable.\"\n\n\"I see. You _will_ do, Olmstead, if you live. There's a test, you know.\"\n\n\"They told me there would be.\"\n\n\"Well, aren't you curious to know what it is?\"\n\n\"Not particularly. _You_ passed it, didn't you?\"\n\n\"What do you mean by _that_ crack?\" Herkimer leaped to his feet; his\neyes, smoldering before, now ablaze.\n\n\"Exactly what I said, no more and no less. You may read into it\nanything you please.\" Samms' voice was as cold as were his eyes. \"You\npicked me out because of what I am. Did you think that moving upstairs\nwould make a boot-licker out of me?\"\n\n\"Not at all.\" Herkimer sat down and took from a drawer two small,\ntransparent, vaguely capsule-like tubes, each containing a few\nparticles of purple dust. \"You know what this is?\"\n\n\"I can guess.\"\n\n\"Each of these is a good, heavy jolt; about all that a strong man with\na strong heart can stand. Sit down. Here is one dose. Pull the cover,\nstick the capsule up one nostril, squeeze the ejector, and sniff. If\nyou can leave this other dose sitting here on the desk you will live,\nand thus pass the test. If you can't, you die.\"\n\nSamms sat, and pulled, and squeezed, and sniffed.\n\nHis forearms hit the desk with a thud. His hands clenched themselves\ninto fists, the tight-stretched tendons standing boldly out. His face\nturned white. His eyes jammed themselves shut; his jaw-muscles sprang\ninto bands and lumps as they clamped his teeth hard together. Every\nvoluntary muscle in his body went into a rigor as extreme as that of\ndeath itself. His heart pounded; his breathing became stertorous.\n\nThis was the dreadful \"muscle-lock\" so uniquely characteristic of\nthionite; the frenzied immobility of the ultimately passionate\nsatisfaction of every desire.\n\nThe Galactic Patrol became for him an actuality; a force for good\npervading all the worlds of all the galaxies of all the universes of\nall existing space-time continual. He knew what the Lens was, and why.\nHe understood time and space. He knew the absolute beginning and the\nultimate end.\n\nHe also saw things and did things over which it is best to draw a\nkindly veil, for _every_ desire--mental or physical, open or sternly\nsuppressed, noble or base--that Virgil Samms had ever had was being\n_completely satisfied_. EVERY DESIRE.\n\nAs Samms sat there, straining motionlessly upon the verge of death\nthrough sheer ecstasy, a door opened and Senator Morgan entered the\nroom. Herkimer started, almost imperceptibly, as he turned--had there\nbeen, or not, an instantaneously-suppressed flash of guilt in those now\ncompletely clear and frank brown eyes?\n\n\"Hi, Chief; come in and sit down. Glad to see you--this is not exactly\nmy idea of fun.\"\n\n\"No? When did you stop being a sadist?\" The senator sat down beside\nhis minion's desk, the fingertips of his left hand began soundlessly\nto drum. \"You wouldn't have, by any chance, been considering the idea\nof...?\" He paused significantly.\n\n\"What an idea.\" Herkimer's act--if it was an act--was flawless. \"He's\ntoo good a man to waste.\"\n\n\"I know it, but you didn't act as though you did. I've never seen you\ncome out such a poor second in an interview ... and it wasn't because\nyou didn't know to start with just what kind of a tiger he was--that's\nwhy he was selected for this job. And it would have been so easy to\ngive him just a wee bit more.\"\n\n\"That's preposterous, Chief, and you know it.\"\n\n\"Do I? However, it couldn't have been jealousy, because he isn't being\nconsidered for your job. He won't be over you, and there's plenty of\nroom for everybody. What was the matter? Your bloodthirstiness wouldn't\nhave taken you _that_ far, under these circumstances. Come clean,\nHerkimer.\"\n\n\"Okay--I hate the whole damned family!\" Herkimer burst out, viciously.\n\n\"I see. That adds up.\" Morgan's face cleared, his fingers became\nmotionless. \"You can't make the Samms wench and aren't in position to\nskin her alive, so you get allergic to all her relatives. That adds\nup, but let me tell you something.\" His quiet, level voice carried\nmore of menace than most men's loudest threats. \"Keep your love life\nout of business and keep that sadistic streak under control. Don't let\nanything like this happen again.\"\n\n\"I won't, Chief. I got off the beam--but he made me so _damn_ mad!\"\n\n\"Certainly. That's exactly what he was trying to do. Elementary. If he\ncould make you look small it would make him look big, and he just about\ndid. But watch now, he's coming to.\"\n\nSamms' muscles relaxed. He opened his eyes groggily; then, as a wave\nof humiliated realization swept over his consciousness, he closed them\nagain and shuddered. He had always thought himself pretty much of a\nman; how could he _possibly_ have descended to such nauseous depths\nof depravity, of turpitude, of sheer moral degradation? And yet every\ncell of his being was shrieking its demand for more; his mind and\nhis substance alike were permeated by an over-mastering craving to\nexperience again the ultimate thrills which they had so tremendously,\nso outrageously enjoyed.\n\nThere was another good jolt lying right there on the desk in front of\nhim, even though thionite-sniffers always saw to it that no more of the\ndrug could be obtained without considerable physical exertion; which\nexertion would bring them to their senses. If he took that jolt it\nwould kill him. What of it? What was death? What good was life, except\nto enjoy such thrills as he had just had and was about to have again?\nAnd besides, thionite couldn't kill _him_. He was a super-man; he had\njust proved it!\n\nHe straightened up and reached for the capsule; and that effort, small\nas it was, was enough to bring First Lensman Virgil Samms back under\ncontrol. The craving, however, did not decrease. Rather, it increased.\n\nMonths were to pass before he could think of thionite, or even of\nthe color purple, without a spasmodic catching of the breath and a\ntightening of every muscle. Years were to pass before he could forget,\neven partially, the theretofore unsuspected dwellers in the dark\nrecesses of his own mind. Nevertheless, from the store of whatever it\nwas that made him what he was, Virgil Samms drew strength. Thumb and\nforefinger touched the capsule, but instead of picking it up, he pushed\nit across the desk toward Herkimer.\n\n\"Put it away, bub. One whiff of that stuff will last me for life.\" He\nstared unfathomably at the secretary, then turned to Morgan and nodded.\n\"After all, he did not _say_ that he ever passed this or any other\ntest. He just didn't contradict me when I said it.\"\n\nWith a visible effort Herkimer remained silent, but Morgan did not.\n\n\"You talk too much, Olmstead. Can you stand up yet?\"\n\nGripping the desk with both hands, Samms heaved himself to his feet.\nThe room was spinning and gyrating; every individual thing in it was\nmoving in a different and impossible orbit; his already splintered\nskull threatened more and more violently to emulate a fragmentation\nbomb; black and white spots and vari-colored flashes filled his cone of\nvision. He wrenched one hand free, then the other--and collapsed back\ninto the chair.\n\n\"Not yet--quite,\" he admitted, through stiff lips.\n\nAlthough he was careful not to show it, Morgan was amazed--not that\nthe man had collapsed, but that he had been able so soon to lift\nhimself even an inch. \"Tiger\" was not the word; this Olmstead must be\nseven-eighths dinosaur.\n\n\"It takes a few minutes; longer for some, not so long for others,\"\nMorgan said, blandly. \"But what makes you think Herkimer here never\ntook one of the same?\"\n\n\"Huh?\" Again two pairs of eyes locked and held; and this time the duel\nwas longer and more pregnant. \"What do _you_ think? How do you suppose\nI lived to get as old as I am now? By being dumb?\"\n\nMorgan unwrapped a Venerian cigar, settled it comfortably between his\nteeth, lit it, and drew three slow puffs before replying.\n\n\"Ah, a student. An analytical mind,\" he said, evenly,\nand--apparently--irrelevantly. \"Let's skip Herkimer for the moment. Try\nyour hand on me.\"\n\n\"Why not? From what we hear out in the field, you have always been in\nthe upper brackets, so you probably never had to prove that you could\ntake it or let it alone. My guess would be, though, that you could.\"\n\n\"The good old oil, eh?\" Morgan allowed his face and voice to register\na modicum, precisely metered, of contempt. \"How to get along in the\nworld; Lesson One: Butter up the Boss.\"\n\n\"Nice try, Senator, but I'll have to score you a clean miss.\" Samms,\nnow back almost to normal, grinned companionably. \"We both know that if\nI were still in the kindergarten I wouldn't be here now.\"\n\n\"I'll let that one pass--this time.\" Under that look and tone Morgan's\nunderlings were wont to cringe, but this Olmstead was not the cringing\ntype. \"Don't do it again. It might not be safe.\"\n\n\"Oh, it would be safe enough--for today, at least. There are two\nfactors which you are very carefully ignoring. First, I haven't\naccepted the job yet.\"\n\n\"Are you innocent enough to think you'll get out of this building\nalive if I don't accept you?\"\n\n\"If you want to call it innocence, yes. Oh, I know you've got gunnies\nall over the place, but they don't mean a thing.\"\n\n\"No?\" Morgan's voice was silkily venomous.\n\n\"No.\" Olmstead was completely unimpressed. \"Put yourself in my place.\nYou know I've been around a long time; and not just around my mother. I\nwas weaned quite a number of years ago.\"\n\n\"I see. You don't scare worth a damn. A point. And you are testing me,\njust as I am testing you. Another point. I'm beginning to like you,\nGeorge. I think I know what your second point is, but let's have it,\njust for the record.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you do. Any man, to be my boss, has got to be at least as\ngood a man as I am. Otherwise I take his job away from him.\"\n\n\"Fair enough. By God, I _do_ like you, Olmstead!\" Morgan, his big face\nwreathed in smiles, got up, strode over, and shook hands vigorously;\nand Samms, scan as he would, could not even hazard a guess as to how\nmuch--if any--of this enthusiasm was real. \"Do you want the job? And\nwhen can you go to work?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Two hours ago, sir.\"\n\n\"That's fine!\" Morgan boomed. Although he did not comment upon it, he\nnoticed and understood the change in the form of address. \"Without\nknowing what the job is or how much it pays?\"\n\n\"Neither is important, sir, at the moment.\" Samms, who had got up\neasily enough to shake hands, now shook his head experimentally.\nNothing rattled. Good--he was in pretty good shape already. \"As to the\njob, I can either do it or find out why it can't be done. As to pay,\nI've heard you called a lot of things, but 'piker' was never one of\nthem.\"\n\n\"Very well. I predict that you will go far.\" Morgan again shook the\nLensman's hand; and again Samms could not evaluate the Senator's\nsincerity. \"Tuesday afternoon. New York Spaceport. Space-ship _Virgin\nQueen_. Report to Captain Willoughby in the dock office at fourteen\nhundred hours. Stop at the cashier's office on your way out. Good-bye.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9\n\n\nPiracy was rife. There was no suspicion, however, nor would there be\nfor many years, that there was anything of very large purpose about the\nbusiness. Murgatroyd was simply a Captain Kidd of space; and even if he\nwere actually connected with Galactic Spaceways, that fact would not be\nsurprising. Such relationships had always existed; the most ferocious\nand dreaded pirates of the ancient world worked in full partnership\nwith the First Families of that world.\n\nVirgil Samms was thinking of pirates and of piracy when he left Senator\nMorgan's office. He was still thinking of them while he was reporting\nto Roderick Kinnison. Hence:\n\n\"But that's enough about this stuff and me, Rod. Bring me up to date on\nOperation Boskone.\"\n\n\"Branching out no end. Your guess was right that Spaceways' losses to\npirates are probably phony. But it wasn't the _known_ attacks--that\nis, those cases in which the ship was found, later, with some or most\nof the personnel alive--that gave us the real information. They were\nall pretty much alike. But when we studied the total disappearances we\nreally hit the jack-pot.\"\n\n\"That doesn't sound just right, but I'm listening.\"\n\n\"You'd better, since it goes farther than even you suspected. It was no\ntrouble at all to get the passenger lists and the names of the crews of\nthe independent ships that were lost without a trace. Their relatives\nand friends--we concentrated mostly on wives--could be located, except\nfor the usual few who moved around so much that they got lost. Spacemen\naverage young, you know, and their wives are still younger. Well, these\nyoung women got jobs, most of them remarried, and so on. In short,\nnormal.\"\n\n\"And in the case of Spaceways, not normal?\"\n\n\"Decidedly not. In the first place, you'd be amazed at how little\npublication was ever done of passenger lists, and apparently crew\nlists were not published at all. No use going into detail as to how\nwe got the stuff, but we got it. However, nine tenths of the wives had\ndisappeared, and none had remarried. The only ones we could find were\nthose who did not care, even when their husbands were alive, whether\nthey ever saw them again or not. But the big break was--you remember\nthe disappearance of that girls'-school cruise ship?\"\n\n\"Of course. It made a lot of noise.\"\n\n\"An interesting point in connection with that cruise is that two days\nbefore the ship blasted off the school was robbed. The vault was\nopened with thermite and the whole Administration Building burned to\nthe ground. All the school's records were destroyed. Thus, the list of\nmissing had to be made up from statements made by friends, relatives,\nand what not.\"\n\n\"I remember something of the kind. My impression was, though, that\nthe space-ship company furnished.... Oh!\" The tone of Samms' thought\nalerted sharply. \"That was Spaceways, under cover?\"\n\n\"Definitely. Our best guess is that there were quite a few shiploads of\nwomen disappeared about that time, instead of one. Austine's College\nhad more students that year than ever before or since. It was the\nextras, not the regulars, who went on that cruise; the ones who figured\nit would be more convenient to disappear in space than to become\nordinary missing persons.\"\n\n\"But Rod! That would mean ... but where?\"\n\n\"It means just that. And finding out 'where' will run into a project.\nThere are over two thousand million suns in this galaxy, and the best\nestimate is that there are more than that many planets habitable by\nbeings more or less human in type. You know how much of the galaxy has\nbeen explored and how fast the work of exploring the rest of it is\ngoing. Your guess is just as good as mine as to where those spacemen\nand engineers and their wives and girl-friends are now. I am sure,\nthough, of four things; none of which we can ever begin to prove. One;\nthey didn't die in space. Two; they landed on a comfortable and very\nwell equipped Tellurian planet. Three; they built a fleet there. Four;\nthat fleet attacked the Hill.\"\n\n\"Murgatroyd, do you suppose?\" Although surprised by Kinnison's\ntremendous report, Samms was not dismayed.\n\n\"No idea. No data--yet.\"\n\n\"And they'll keep on building,\" Samms said. \"They had a fleet much\nlarger than the one they expected to meet. Now they'll build one\nlarger than all our combined forces. And since the politicians will\nalways know what we are doing ... or it might be ... I wonder...?\"\n\n\"You can stop wondering.\" Kinnison grinned savagely.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Just what you were going to think about. You know the edge of the\ngalaxy closest to Tellus, where that big rift cuts in?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Across that rift, where it won't be surveyed for a thousand years,\nthere's a planet that could be Earth's twin sister. No atomic energy,\nno space-drive, but heavily industrialized and anxious to welcome\nus. Project Bennett. Very, _very_ hush-hush. Nobody except Lensmen\nknow anything about it. Two friends of Dronvire's--smart, smooth\noperators--are in charge. It's going to be the Navy Yard of the\nGalactic Patrol.\"\n\n\"But Rod ...\" Samms began to protest, his mind leaping ahead to the\nnumberless problems, the tremendous difficulties, inherent in the\nprogram which his friend had outlined so briefly.\n\n\"Forget it, Virge!\" Kinnison cut in. \"It won't be easy, of course, but\nwe can do anything they can do, and do it better. You can go calmly\nahead with your own chores, knowing that when--and notice that I say\n'when', not 'if'--we need it we'll have a fleet up our sleeves that\nwill make the official one look like a task force. But I see you're\nat the rendezvous, and there's Jill. Tell her 'hi' for me. And as the\nVegians say--'Tail high, brother!'\"\n\nSamms was in the hotel's ornate lobby; a couple of uniformed \"boys\" and\nJill Samms were approaching. The girl reached him first.\n\n\"You had no trouble in recognizing me, then, my dear?\"\n\n\"None at all, Uncle George.\" She kissed him perfunctorily, the bell\nhops faded away. \"So nice to see you--I've heard _so_ much about you.\nThe Marine Room, you said?\"\n\n\"Yes. I reserved a table.\"\n\nAnd in that famous restaurant, in the unequalled privacy of the city's\nnoisiest and most crowded night spot, they drank sparingly; ate\nnot-so-sparingly; and talked not sparingly at all.\n\n\"It's perfectly safe here, you think?\" Jill asked first.\n\n\"Perfectly. A super-sensitive microphone couldn't hear anything, and\nit's so dark that a lip-reader, even if he could read us, would need a\npair of twelve-inch night-glasses.\"\n\n\"Goody! They did a marvelous job, Dad. If it weren't for your ... well,\nyour personality, I wouldn't recognize you even now.\"\n\n\"You think I'm safe, then?\"\n\n\"Absolutely.\"\n\n\"Then we'll get down to business. You, Knobos, and DalNalten all have\nkeen and powerful minds. You can't all be wrong. Spaceways, then, is\ntied in with both the Towne-Morgan gang and with thionite. The logical\nextension of that--Dal certainly thought of it, even though he didn't\nmention it--would be ...\" Samms paused.\n\n\"Check. That the notorious Murgatroyd, instead of being just another\npirate chief, is really working for Spaceways and belongs to the\nTowne-Morgan-Isaacson gang. But dad--what an idea! Can things be _that_\nrotten, really?\"\n\n\"They may be worse than that. Now the next thing. Who, in your opinion,\nis the real boss?\"\n\n\"Well, it certainly is not Herkimer Herkimer Third.\" Jill ticked him\noff on a pink forefinger. She had been asked for an opinion; she\nset out to give it without apology or hesitation. \"He could--just\nabout--direct the affairs of a hot-dog stand. Nor is it Clander. He\nisn't even a little fish; he's scarcely a minnow. Equally certainly\nit is neither the Venerian nor the Martian. They may run planetary\naffairs, but nothing bigger. I haven't met Murgatroyd, of course, but\nI have had several evaluations, and he does not rate up with Towne.\nAnd Big Jim--and this surprised me as much as it will you--is almost\ncertainly not the prime mover.\" She looked at him questioningly.\n\n\"That would have surprised me tremendously yesterday; but after\ntoday--I'll tell you about that presently--it doesn't.\"\n\n\"I'm glad of that. I expected an argument, and I have been inclined\nto question the validity of my own results, since they do not agree\nwith common knowledge--or, rather, what is supposed to be knowledge.\nThat leaves Isaacson and Senator Morgan.\" Jill frowned in perplexity;\nseemed, for the first time, unsure. \"Isaacson is of course a big man.\nAble. Well-informed. Extremely capable. A top-notch executive. Not only\n_is_, would _have_ to be, to run Spaceways. On the other hand, I have\nalways thought that Morgan was nothing but a windbag....\" Jill stopped\ntalking; left the thought hanging in air.\n\n\"So did I--until today,\" Samms agreed grimly. \"I thought that he was\nsimply an unusually corrupt, greedy, rabble-rousing politician. Our\nestimates of him may have to be changed very radically.\"\n\nSamms' mind raced. From two entirely different angles of approach, Jill\nand he had arrived at the same conclusion. But, if Morgan were really\nthe Big Shot, would he have deigned to interview personally such small\nfry as Olmstead? Or was Olmstead's job of more importance than he,\nSamms, had supposed?\n\n\"I've got a dozen more things to check with you,\" he went on, almost\nwithout a pause, \"but since this leadership matter is the only one in\nwhich my experience would affect your judgment, I had better tell you\nabout what happened today....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTuesday came, and hour fourteen hundred; and Samms strode into an\noffice. There was a big, clean desk; a wiry, intense, gray-haired man.\n\n\"Captain Willoughby?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"George Olmstead reporting.\"\n\n\"Fourth Officer.\" The captain punched a button; the heavy, sound-proof\ndoor closed itself and locked.\n\n\"_Fourth_ Officer? New rank, eh. What does the ticket cover?\"\n\n\"New, and special. Here's the articles; read it and sign it.\" He did\nnot add \"or else\", it was not necessary. It was clearly evident that\nCaptain Willoughby, never garrulous, intended to be particularly\nreticent with his new subordinate.\n\nSamms read. \"... Fourth Officer ... shall ... no duties or\nresponsibilities in the operation or maintenance of said space-ship ...\ncargo ...\" Then came a clause which fairly leaped from the paper and\nsmote his eyes: \"when in command of a detail outside the hull of said\nspace-ship he shall enforce, by the infliction of death or such other\npenalty as he deems fit....\"\n\nThe Lensman was rocked to the heels, but did not show it. Instead, he\ntook the captain's pen--his own, as far as Willoughby was concerned,\ncould have been filled with vanishing ink--and wrote George Olmstead's\nname in George Olmstead's bold, flowing script.\n\nWilloughby then took him aboard the good ship _Virgin Queen_ and led\nhim to his cabin.\n\n\"Here you are, Mr. Olmstead. Beyond getting acquainted with the\nsuper-cargo and the rest of your men, you will have no duties for a few\ndays. You have full run of the ship, with one exception. Stay out of\nthe control room until I call you. Is that clear?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" Willoughby turned away and Samms, after tossing his\nspace-bag into the rack, took inventory.\n\nThe room was of course very small; but, considering the importance of\nmass, it was almost extravagantly supplied. There were shelves, or\nrather, tight racks, of books; there were sun-lamps and card-shelves\nand exercisers and games; there was a receiver capable of bringing in\nprograms from almost anywhere in space. The room had only one lack; it\ndid not have an ultra-wave visiplate. Nor was this lack surprising.\n\"They\" would scarcely let George Olmstead know where \"they\" were taking\nhim.\n\nSamms was surprised, however, when he met the men who were to be\ndirectly under his command; for instead of one, or at most two, they\nnumbered exactly forty. And they were all, he thought at first glance,\nthe dregs and sweepings of the lowest dives in space. Before long,\nhowever, he learned that they were not all space-rats and denizens\nof Skid Rows. Six of them--the strongest physically and the hardest\nmentally of the lot--were fugitives from lethal chambers; murderers\nand worse. He looked at the biggest, toughest one of the six--a\nrock-drill-eyed, red-haired giant--and asked:\n\n\"What did they tell you, Tworn, that your job was going to be?\"\n\n\"They didn't say. Just that it was dangerous, but if I done exactly\nwhat my boss would tell me to do, and nothing else, I might not even\nget hurt. An' I was due to take the deep breath the next week, see?\nThat's just how it was, boss.\"\n\n\"I see,\" and one by one Virgil Samms, master psychologist, studied and\nanalyzed his motley crew until he was called into the control room.\n\nThe navigating tank was covered; no charts were to be seen. The one\n\"live\" visiplate showed a planet and a fiercely blue-white sun.\n\n\"My orders are to tell you, at this point, all I know about what you've\ngot to do and about that planet down there. Trenco, they call it.\" To\nVirgil Samms, the first adherent of Civilization ever to hear it, that\nname meant nothing whatever. \"You are to take about five of your men,\ngo down there, and gather all the green leaves you can. Not green in\ncolor; sort of purplish. What they call broadleaf is the best; leaves\nabout two feet long and a foot wide. But don't be too choosy. If there\nisn't any broadleaf handy, grab anything you can get hold of.\"\n\n\"What is the opposition?\" Samms asked, quietly. \"And what have they got\nthat makes them so tough?\"\n\n\"Nothing. No inhabitants, even. Just the planet itself. Next to Arisia,\nit's the God damndest planet in space. I've never been any closer to it\nthan this, and I never will, so I don't know anything about it except\nwhat I hear; but there's something about it that kills men or drives\nthem crazy. We spend seven or eight boats every trip, and thirty-five\nor forty men, and the biggest load that anybody ever took away from\nhere was just under two hundred pounds of leaf. A good many times we\ndon't get any.\"\n\n\"They go crazy, eh?\" In spite of his control, Samms paled. But it\ncouldn't be like Arisia. \"What are the symptoms? What do they say?\"\n\n\"Various. Main thing seems to be that they lose their sight. Don't go\nblind, exactly, but can't see where anything is; or, if they do see\nit, it isn't there. And it rains over forty feet deep every night, and\nyet it all dries up by morning. The worst electrical storms in the\nuniverse, and wind-velocities--I can show you charts on that--of over\neight hundred miles an hour.\"\n\n\"Whew! How about time? With your permission, I would like to do some\nsurveying before I try to land.\"\n\n\"A smart idea. A couple of the other boys had the same, but it didn't\nhelp--they didn't come back. I'll give you two Tellurian days--no,\nthree--before I give you up and start sending out the other boats. Pick\nout your five men and see what you can do.\"\n\nAs the boat dropped away, Willoughby's voice came briskly from a\nspeaker. \"I know that you five men have got ideas. Forget 'em. Fourth\nOfficer Olmstead has the authority and the orders to put a half-ounce\nslug through the guts of any or all of you that don't jump, and jump\nfast, to do what he tells you. And if that boat makes any funny moves I\nblast it out of the ether. Good harvesting!\"\n\nFor forty-eight Tellurian hours, taking time out only to sleep, Samms\nscanned and surveyed the planet Trenco; and the more he studied it, the\nmore outrageously abnormal it became.\n\nTrenco was, and is, a peculiar planet indeed. Its atmosphere is not air\nas we know air; its hydrosphere does not resemble water. Half of that\natmosphere and most of that hydrosphere are one chemical, a substance\nof very low heat of vaporization and having a boiling point of about\nseventy-five degrees Fahrenheit. Trenco's days are intensely hot; its\nnights are bitterly cold.\n\nAt night, therefore, it rains: and by comparison a Tellurian downpour\nof one inch per hour is scarcely a drizzle. Upon Trenco it really\n_rains_--forty seven feet and five inches of precipitation, every night\nof every Trenconian year. And this tremendous condensation of course\ncauses wind. Willoughby's graphs were accurate. Except at Trenco's\nvery poles there is not a spot in which or a time at which an Earthly\ngale would not constitute a dead calm; and along the equator, at every\nsunrise and every sunset, the wind blows from the day side into the\nnight side at a velocity which no Tellurian hurricane or cyclone,\nhowever violent, has even distantly approached.\n\nAlso, therefore, there is lightning. Not in the mild and occasional\nflashes which we of gentle Terra know, but in a continuous, blinding\nglare which outshines a normal sun; in battering, shattering,\nmulti-billion-volt discharges which not only make darkness unknown\nthere, but also distort beyond recognition and beyond function the warp\nand the woof of space itself. Sight is almost completely useless in\nthat fantastically altered medium. So is the ultra-beam.\n\nLanding on the daylight side, except possibly at exact noon, would be\nimpossible because of the wind, nor could the ship stay landed for\nmore than a couple of minutes. Landing on the night side would be\npractically as bad, because of the terrific charge the boat would pick\nup--unless the boat carried something that could be rebuilt into a\nleaker. Did it? It did.\n\nTime after time, from pole to pole and from midnight around the clock,\nSamms stabbed Visibeam and spy-ray down toward Trenco's falsely-visible\nsurface, with consistently and meaninglessly impossible results. The\nplanet tipped, lurched, spun, and danced. It broke up into chunks, each\nof which began insanely to follow mathematically impossible paths.\n\nFinally, in desperation, he rammed a beam down and held it down. Again\nhe saw the planet break up before his eyes, but this time he held on.\nHe _knew_ that he was well out of the stratosphere, a good two hundred\nmiles up. Nevertheless, he _saw_ a tremendous mass of jagged rock\nfalling straight down, with terrific velocity, upon his tiny lifeboat!\n\nUnfortunately the crew, to whom he had not been paying overmuch\nattention of late, saw it, too; and one of them, with a bestial yell,\nleaped toward Samms and the controls. Samms, reaching for pistol and\nblackjack, whirled around just in time to see the big red-head lay the\nwould-be attacker out cold with a vicious hand's-edge chop at the base\nof the skull.\n\n\"Thanks, Tworn. Why?\"\n\n\"Because I want to get out of this alive, and he'd've had us all in\nhell in fifteen minutes. You know a hell of a lot more than we do, so\nI'm playin' it your way. See?\"\n\n\"I see. Can you use a sap?\"\n\n\"An artist,\" the big man admitted, modestly. \"Just tell me how long\nyou want a guy to be out and I won't miss it a minute, either way. But\nyou'd better blow that crumb's brains out, right now. He ain't no damn\ngood.\"\n\n\"Not until after I see whether he can work or not. You're a Procian,\naren't you?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Midlands--North Central.\"\n\n\"What did you do?\"\n\n\"Nothing much, at first. Just killed a guy that needed killing; but\nthe goddam louse had a lot of money, so they give me twenty five\nyears. I didn't like it very well, and acted rough, so they give me\nsolitary--boot, bandage, and so on. So I tried a break--killed six or\neight, maybe a dozen, guards--but didn't quite make it. So they slated\nme for the big whiff. That's all, boss.\"\n\n\"I'm promoting you, now, to squad leader. Here's the sap.\" He handed\nTworn his blackjack. \"Watch 'em--I'll be too busy to. This landing is\ngoing to be tough.\"\n\n\"Gotcha, boss.\" Tworn was calibrating his weapon by slugging himself\nexperimentally on the leg. \"Go ahead. As far as these crumbs are\nconcerned, you've got this air-tank all to yourself.\"\n\nSamms had finally decided what he was going to do. He located the\nterminator on the morning side, poised his little ship somewhat nearer\nto dawn than to midnight, and \"cut the rope\". He took one quick reading\non the sun, cut off his plates, and let her drop, watching only his\npressure gages and gyros.\n\nOne hundred millimeters of mercury. Three hundred. Five hundred. He\nslowed her down. He was going to hit a thin liquid, but if he hit\nit too hard he would smash the boat, and he had no idea what the\natmospheric pressure at Trenco's surface would be. Six hundred. Even\nthis late at night, it might be greater than Earth's ... and it might\nbe a lot less. Seven hundred.\n\nSlower and slower he crept downward, his tension mounting infinitely\nfaster than did the needle of the gage. This was an instrument landing\nwith a vengeance! Eight hundred. How was the crew taking it? How many\nof them had Tworn had to disable? He glanced quickly around. None! Now\nthat they could not see the hallucinatory images upon the plates, they\nwere not suffering at all--he himself was the only one aboard who was\nfeeling the strain!\n\nNine hundred ... nine hundred forty. The boat \"hit the drink\" with a\ncrashing, splashing impact. Its pace was slow enough, however, and the\nliquid was deep enough, so that no damage was done. Samms applied a\nlittle driving power and swung his craft's sharp nose into the line\ntoward the sun. The little ship plowed slowly forward, as nearly just\nawash as Samms could keep her; grounded as gently as a river steam-boat\nupon a mud-flat. The starkly incredible downpour slackened; the Lensman\nknew that the second critical moment was at hand.\n\n\"Strap down, men, until we see what this wind is going to do to us.\"\n\nThe atmosphere, moving at a velocity well above that of sound, was in\neffect not a gas, but a solid. Even a spaceboat's hard skin of alloy\nplate, with all its bracing, could not take what was coming next.\nInert, she would be split open, smashed, flattened out, and twisted\ninto pretzels. Samms' finger stabbed down; the Berg went into action;\nthe lifeboat went free just as that raging blast of quasi-solid vapor\nwrenched her into the air.\n\nThe second descent was much faster and much easier than the first. Nor,\nthis time, did Samms remain surfaced or drive toward shore. Knowing now\nthat this ocean was not deep enough to harm his vessel, he let her sink\nto the bottom. More, he turned her on her side and drove her at a flat\nangle into the bottom; so deep that the rim of her starboard lock was\nflush with the ocean's floor. Again they waited; and this time the wind\ndid not blow the lifeboat away.\n\nUpon purely theoretical grounds Samms had reasoned that the weird\ndistortion of vision must be a function of distance, and his\nobservations so far had been in accord with that hypothesis. Now,\nslowly and cautiously, he sent out a visibeam. Ten feet ... twenty ...\nforty ... all clear. At fifty the seeing was definitely bad; at sixty\nit became impossible. He shortened back to forty and began to study the\nvegetation, growing with such fantastic speed that the leaves, pressed\nflat to the ground by the gale and anchored there by heavy rootlets,\nwere already inches long. There was also what seemed to be animal life,\nof sorts, but Samms was not, at the moment, interested in Trenconian\nzoology.\n\n\"Are them the plants we're going to get, boss?\" Tworn asked, staring\ninto the plate over Samms' shoulder. \"Shall we go out now an' start\npickin' 'em?\"\n\n\"Not yet. Even if we could open the port the blast would wreck us.\nAlso, it would shear your head off, flush with the coaming, as fast\nas you stuck it out. This wind should ease off after a while; we'll go\nout a little before noon. In the meantime we'll get ready. Have the\nboys break out a couple of spare Number Twelve struts, some clamps and\nchain, four snatch blocks, and a hundred feet of heavy space-line....\n\n\"Good,\" he went on, when the order had been obeyed. \"Rig the line from\nthe winch through snatch blocks here, and here, and here, so I can haul\nyou back against the wind. While you are doing that I'll rig a remote\ncontrol on the winch.\"\n\nShortly before Trenco's fierce, blue-white sun reached meridian, the\nsix men donned space-suits and Samms cautiously opened the air-lock\nports. They worked. The wind was now scarcely more than an Earthly\nhurricane; the wildly whipping broadleaf plants, struggling upward,\nwere almost half-way to the vertical. The leaves were apparently almost\nfully grown.\n\nFour men clamped their suits to the line. The line was paid out. Each\nman selected two leaves; the largest, fattest, purplest ones he could\nreach. Samms hauled them back and received the loot; Tworn stowed the\nleaves away. Again--again--again.\n\nWith noon there came a few minutes of \"calm\". A strong man could\nstand against the now highly variable wind; could move around without\nbeing blown beyond the horizon; and during those few minutes all six\nmen gathered leaves. That time, however, was very short. The wind\nsteadied into the reverse direction with ever-increasing fury; winch\nand space-line again came into play. And in a scant half hour, when the\nline began to hum an almost musical note under its load, Samms decided\nto call it quits.\n\n\"That'll be all for today, boys,\" he announced. \"About twice more and\nthis line will part. You've done too good a job to lose you. Secure\nship.\"\n\n\"Shall I blow the air, sir?\" Tworn asked.\n\n\"I don't think so.\" Samms thought for a moment. \"No. I'm afraid to\ntake the chance. This stuff, whatever it is, is probably as poisonous\nas cyanide. We'll keep our suits on and exhaust into space.\"\n\nTime passed. \"Night\" came; the rain and the flood. The bottom softened.\nSamms blasted the lifeboat out of the mud and away from the planet. He\nopened the bleeder valves, then both air-lock ports; the contaminated\nair was replaced by the ultra-hard vacuum of the inter-planetary void.\nHe signaled the _Virgin Queen_; the lifeboat was taken aboard.\n\n\"Quick trip, Olmstead,\" Willoughby congratulated him. \"I'm surprised\nthat you got back at all, to say nothing of with so much stuff and not\nlosing a man. Give me the weight, mister, fast!\"\n\n\"Three hundred and forty eight pounds, sir,\" the super-cargo reported.\n\n\"My God! And all pure broadleaf! _Nobody_ ever did _that_ before! How\ndid you do it, Olmstead?\"\n\n\"I don't know whether that would be any of your business or not.\"\nSamms' mien was not insulting; merely thoughtful. \"Not that I give a\ndamn, but my way might not help anybody else much, and I think I had\nbetter report to the main office first, and let them do the telling.\nFair enough?\"\n\n\"Fair enough,\" the skipper conceded, ungrudgingly. \"What a load! And no\nlosses!\"\n\n\"One boatload of air, is all; but air is expensive out here.\" Samms\nmade a point, deliberately.\n\n\"Air!\" Willoughby snorted. \"I'll swap you a hundred flasks of air, any\ntime, for any one of those leaves!\" Which was what Samms wanted to know.\n\nCaptain Willoughby was smart. He knew that the way to succeed was to\nuse and then to trample upon his inferiors; to toady to such superiors\nas were too strong to be pulled down and thus supplanted. He knew this\nOlmstead had what it took to be a big shot. Therefore:\n\n\"They told me to keep you in the dark until we got to Trenco,\" he more\nthan half apologized to his Fourth Officer shortly after the _Virgin\nQueen_ blasted away from the Trenconian system. \"But they didn't say\nanything about afterwards--maybe they figured you wouldn't be aboard\nany more, as usual--but anyway, you can stay right here in the control\nroom if you want to.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Skipper, but mightn't it be just as well,\" he jerked his head\ninconspicuously toward the other officers, \"to play the string out,\nthis trip? I don't care where we're going, and we don't want anybody\nto get any funny ideas.\"\n\n\"That'd be a lot better, of course--as long as you know that your cards\nare all aces, as far as I'm concerned.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Willoughby. I'll remember that.\"\n\nSamms had not been entirely frank with the private captain. From\nthe time required to make the trip, he knew to within a few parsecs\nTrenco's distance from Sol. He did not know the direction, since the\ndistance was so great that he had not been able to recognize any star\nor constellation. He did know, however, the course upon which the\nvessel then was, and he would know courses and distances from then on.\nHe was well content.\n\nA couple of uneventful days passed. Samms was again called into the\ncontrol room, to see that the ship was approaching a three-sun solar\nsystem.\n\n\"This where we're going to land?\" he asked, indifferently.\n\n\"We ain't going to land,\" Willoughby told him. \"You are going to take\nthe broadleaf down in your boat, close enough so that you can parachute\nit down to where it has to go. Way 'nuff, pilot, go inert and match\nintrinsics. Now, Olmstead, watch. You've seen systems like this before?\"\n\n\"No, but I know about them. Those two suns over there are a hell of\na lot bigger and further away than they look, and this one here,\nmuch smaller, is in the Trojan position. Have those big suns got any\nplanets?\"\n\n\"Five or six apiece, they say; all hotter and dryer than the brazen\nhinges of hell. This sun here has seven, but Number Two--'Cavenda',\nthey call it--is the only Tellurian planet in the system. The first\nthing we look for is a big, diamond-shaped continent ... there's only\none of that shape ... there it is, over there. Notice that one end is\nbigger than the other--that end is north. Strike a line to split the\ncontinent in two and measure from the north end one-third of the length\nof the line. That's the point we're diving at now ... see that crater?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" The _Virgin Queen_, although still hundreds of miles up, was\nslowing rapidly. \"It must be a big one.\"\n\n\"It's a good fifty miles across. Go down until you're dead sure that\nthe box will land somewhere inside the rim of that crater. Then dump\nit. The parachute and the sender are automatic. Understand?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; I understand,\" and Samms took off.\n\nHe was vastly more interested in the stars, however, than in delivering\nthe broadleaf. The constellation directly beyond Sol from wherever he\nwas might be recognizable. Its shape would be smaller and more or less\ndistorted; its smaller stars, brilliant to Earthly eyes only because\nof their nearness, would be dimmer, perhaps invisible; the picture\nwould be further confused by intervening, nearby, brilliant strangers;\nbut such giants as Canopus and Rigel and Betelgeuse and Deneb would\ncertainly be highly visible if he could only recognize them. From\nTrenco his search had failed; but he was still trying.\n\n_There_ was something vaguely familiar! Sweating with the mental\neffort, he blocked out the too-near, too-bright stars and studied\nintensively those that were left. A blue-white and a red were most\nprominent. Rigel and Betelgeuse? Could that constellation be Orion? The\nBelt was very faint, but it was there. Then Sirius ought to be about\nthere, and Pollux about there; and, at this distance, about equally\nbright. They were. Aldebaran would be orange, and about one magnitude\nbrighter than Pollux; and Capella would be yellow, and half a magnitude\nbrighter still. There they were! Not too close to where they should be,\nbut close enough--it was Orion! And this thionite way-station, then,\nwas somewhere near right ascension seventeen hours and declination plus\nten degrees!\n\nHe returned to the _Virgin Queen_. She blasted off. Samms asked very\nfew questions and Willoughby volunteered very little information;\nnevertheless the First Lensman learned more than anyone of his fellow\npirates would have believed possible. Aloof, taciturn, disinterested to\na degree, he seemed to spend practically all of his time in his cabin\nwhen he was not actually at work; but he kept his eyes and his ears\nwide open. And Virgil Samms, as has been intimated, had a brain.\n\nThe _Virgin Queen_ made a quick flit from Cavenda to Vegia, arriving\nexactly on time; a proud, clean space-ship as high above suspicion as\nCalpurnia herself. Samms unloaded her cargo; replaced it with one for\nEarth. She was serviced. She made a fast, eventless run to Tellus. She\ndocked at New York Spaceport. Virgil Samms walked unconcernedly into\nan ordinary-looking rest-room; George Olmstead, fully informed, walked\nunconcernedly out.\n\nAs soon as he could, Samms Lensed Northrop and Jack Kinnison.\n\n\"We lined up a thousand and one signals, sir,\" Northrop reported for\nthe pair, \"but only one of them carried a message, and it didn't make\nsense.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Samms asked, sharply. \"With a Lens, _any_ kind of a message,\nhowever garbled, coded, or interrupted, makes sense.\"\n\n\"Oh, we understood what it said,\" Jack came in, \"but it didn't say\nenough. Just 'READY--READY--READY'; over and over.\"\n\n\"What!\" Samms exclaimed, and the boys could feel his mind work. \"Did\nthat signal, by any chance, originate anywhere near seventeen hours and\nplus ten degrees?\"\n\n\"Very near. Why? How did you know?\"\n\n\"Then it does make sense!\" Samms exclaimed, and called a general\nconference of Lensmen.\n\n\"Keep working along these same lines,\" Samms directed, finally. \"Keep\nRay Olmstead in the Hill in my place. I am going to Pluto, and--I\nhope--to Palain Seven.\"\n\nRoderick Kinnison of course protested; but, equally of course, his\nprotests were over-ruled.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\n\nPluto is, on the average, about forty times as far away from the sun\nas is Mother Earth. Each square yard of Earth's surface receives about\nsixteen hundred times as much heat as does each of Pluto's. The sun\nas seen from Pluto is a dim, wan speck. Even at perihelion, an event\nwhich occurs only once in two hundred forty eight Tellurian years, and\nat noon and on the equator, Pluto is so bitterly cold that climatic\nconditions upon its surface simply cannot be described by or to\nwarm-blooded, oxygen-breathing man.\n\nAs good an indication as any can be given, perhaps, by mentioning the\nfact that it had taken the Patrol's best engineers over six months\nto perfect the armor which Virgil Samms then wore. For no ordinary\nspace-suit would do. Space itself is not cold; the only loss of heat is\nby radiation into or through an almost perfect vacuum. In contact with\nPluto's rocky, metallic soil, however, there would be conduction; and\nthe magnitude of the inevitable heat-loss made the Tellurian scientists\ngasp.\n\n\"Watch your feet, Virge!\" had been Roderick Kinnison's insistent last\nthought. \"Remember those psychologists--if they stayed in contact with\nthat ground for five minutes they froze their feet to the ankles. Not\nthat the boys aren't good, but slipsticks sometimes slip in more ways\nthan one. If your feet ever start to get cold, drop whatever you're\ndoing and drive back here at max!\"\n\nVirgil Samms landed. His feet stayed warm. Finally, assured that the\nheaters of his suit could carry the load indefinitely, he made his way\non foot into the settlement near which he had come to ground. And there\nhe saw his first Palainian.\n\nOr, strictly speaking, he saw part of his first Palainian; for no\nthree-dimensional creature has ever seen or ever will see in entirety\nany member of any of the frigid-blooded, poison-breathing races.\nSince life as we know it--organic, three-dimensional life--is based\nupon liquid water and gaseous oxygen, such life did not and could not\ndevelop upon planets whose temperatures are only a few degrees above\nabsolute zero. Many, perhaps most, of these ultra-frigid planets have\nan atmosphere of sorts; some have no atmosphere at all. Nevertheless,\nwith or without atmosphere and completely without oxygen and water,\nlife--highly intelligent life--did develop upon millions and millions\nof such worlds. That life is not, however, strictly three-dimensional.\nOf necessity, even in the lowest forms, it possesses an extension into\nthe hyper-dimension; and it is this metabolic extension alone which\nmakes it possible for life to exist under such extreme conditions.\n\nThe extension makes it impossible for any human being to see anything\nof a Palainian except the fluid, amorphous, ever-changing thing which\nis his three-dimensional aspect of the moment; makes any attempt at\ndescription or portraiture completely futile.\n\nVirgil Samms stared at the Palainian; tried to see what it looked like.\nHe could not tell whether it had eyes or antennae; legs, arms, or\ntentacles, teeth or beaks, talons or claws or feet; skin, scales, or\nfeathers. It did not even remotely resemble anything that the Lensman\nhad ever seen, sensed, or imagined. He gave up; sent out an exploring\nthought.\n\n\"I am Virgil Samms, a Tellurian,\" he sent out slowly, carefully, after\nhe made contact with the outer fringes of the creature's mind. \"Is it\npossible for you, sir or madam, to give me a moment of your time?\"\n\n\"Eminently possible, Lensman Samms, since my time is of completely\nnegligible value.\" The monster's mind flashed into accord with Samms'\nwith a speed and precision that made him gasp. That is, a part of it\nbecame en rapport with a part of his: years were to pass before even\nthe First Lensman would know much more about the Palainian than he\nlearned in that first contact; no human beings except the Children\nof the Lens ever were to understand even dimly the labyrinthine\nintricacies, the paradoxical complexities, of the Palainian mind.\n\n\"'Madam' might be approximately correct,\" the native's thought went\nsmoothly on. \"My name, in your symbology, is Twelfth Pilinipsi; by\neducation, training, and occupation I am a Chief Dexitroboper. I\nperceive that you are indeed a native of that hellish Planet Three,\nupon which it was assumed for so long that no life could possibly\nexist. But communication with your race has been almost impossible\nheretofore ... Ah, the Lens. A remarkable device, truly. I would slay\nyou and take it, except for the obvious fact that only you can possess\nit.\"\n\n\"What!\" Dismay and consternation flooded Samms' mind. \"You already know\nthe Lens?\"\n\n\"No. Yours is the first that any of us has perceived. The mechanics,\nthe mathematics, and the basic philosophy of the thing, however, are\nquite clear.\"\n\n\"What!\" Samms exclaimed again. \"You can, then, produce Lenses\nyourselves?\"\n\n\"By no means, any more than you Tellurians can. There are magnitudes,\nvariables, determinants, and forces involved which no Palainian will\never be able to develop, to generate, or to control.\"\n\n\"I see.\" The Lensman pulled himself together. For a First Lensman, he\nwas making a wretched showing indeed....\n\n\"Far from it, sir,\" the monstrosity assured him. \"Considering the\nstrangeness of the environment into which you have voluntarily flung\nyourself so senselessly, your mind is well integrated and strong.\nOtherwise it would have shattered. If our positions were reversed,\nthe mere thought of the raging heat of your Earth would--come no\ncloser, please!\" The thing vanished; reappeared many yards away. Her\nthoughts were a shudder of loathing, of terror, of sheer detestation.\n\"But to get on. I have been attempting to analyze and to understand\nyour purpose, without success. That failure is not too surprising, of\ncourse, since my mind is weak and my total power is small. Explain\nyour mission, please, as simply as you can.\"\n\nWeak? Small? In view of the power the monstrosity had just shown,\nSamms probed for irony, for sarcasm or pretense. There was no trace of\nanything of the kind.\n\nHe tried, then, for fifteen solid minutes, to explain the Galactic\nPatrol, but at the end the Palainian's only reaction was one of blank\nnon-comprehension.\n\n\"I fail completely to perceive the use of, or the need for, such an\norganization,\" she stated flatly. \"This altruism--what good is it? It\nis unthinkable that any other race would take any risks or exert any\neffort for us, any more than we would for them. Ignore and be ignored,\nas you must already know, is the Prime Tenet.\"\n\n\"But there is a little commerce between our worlds; your people did not\nignore our psychologists; and you are not ignoring me,\" Samms pointed\nout.\n\n\"Oh, none of us is perfect,\" Pilinipsi replied, with a mental shrug\nand what seemed to be an airy wave of a multi-tentacled member. \"That\nideal, like any other, can only be approached asymptotically, never\nreached; and I, being somewhat foolish and silly, as well as weak and\nvacillant, am much less perfect than most.\"\n\nFlabbergasted, Samms tried a new tack. \"I might be able to make my\nposition clearer if I knew you better. I know your name, and that you\nare a woman of Palain Seven\"--it is a measure of Virgil Samms' real\nsize that he actually thought \"woman\", and not merely \"female\"--\"but\nall I can understand of your occupation is the name you have given it.\nWhat does a Chief Dexitroboper do?\"\n\n\"She--or he--or, perhaps, it ... is a supervisor of the work of\ndexitroboping.\" The thought, while perfectly clear, was completely\nmeaningless to Samms, and the Palainian knew it. She tried again.\n\"Dexitroboping has to do with ... nourishment? No--with nutrients.\"\n\n\"Ah. Farming--agriculture,\" Samms thought; but this time it was the\nPalainian who could not grasp the concept. \"Hunting? Fishing?\" No\nbetter. \"Show me, then, please.\"\n\nShe tried; but demonstration, too, was useless; for to Samms the\nPalainian's movements were pointless indeed. The peculiarly flowing\nsubtly changing thing darted back and forth, rose and fell, appeared\nand disappeared; undergoing the while cyclic changes in shape and form\nand size, in aspect and texture. It was now spiny, now tentacular, now\nscaly, now covered with peculiarly repellent feather-like fronds,\neach oozing a crimson slime. But it apparently did not _do_ anything\nwhatever. The net result of all its activity was, apparently, zero.\n\n\"There, it is done.\" Pilinipsi's thought again came clear. \"You\nobserved and understood? You did not. That is strange--baffling. Since\nthe Lens did improve communication and understanding tremendously, I\nhoped that it might extend to the physical as well. But there must be\nsome basic, fundamental difference, the nature of which is at present\nobscure. I wonder ... if I had a Lens, too--but no....\"\n\n\"But yes!\" Samms broke in, eagerly. \"Why don't you go to Arisia and be\ntested for one? You have a magnificent, a really _tremendous_ mind.\nIt is of Lensman grade in every respect except one--you simply don't\n_want_ to use it!\"\n\n\"Me? Go to Arisia?\" The thought would have been, in a Tellurian, a\nlaugh of scorn. \"How utterly silly--how abysmally stupid! There would\nbe personal discomfort, quite possibly personal danger, and two Lenses\nwould be little or no better than one in resolving differences between\nour two continua, which are probably in fact incommensurable.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" Samms thought, almost viciously, \"can you introduce me to\nsomeone who is stupider, sillier, and more foolish than you are?\"\n\n\"Not here on Pluto, no.\" The Palainian took no offense. \"That was why\nit was I who interviewed the earlier Tellurian visitors and why I am\nnow conversing with you. The others avoided you.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Samms' thought was grim. \"How about the home planet, then?\"\n\n\"Ah. Undoubtedly. In fact, there is a group, a club, of such persons.\nNone of them is, of course, as insane--as aberrant--as you are, but\nthey are all much more so than I am.\"\n\n\"Who of this club would be most interested in becoming a Lensman?\"\n\n\"Tallick was the least stable member of the New-Thought Club when I\nleft Seven; Kragzex a close second. There may of course have been\nchanges since then. But I cannot believe that even Tallick--even\nTallick at his outrageous worst--would be crazy enough to join your\nPatrol.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, I must see him myself. Can you and will you give me a\nchart of a routing from here to Palain Seven?\"\n\n\"I can and I will. Nothing you have thought will be of any use to me;\nthat will be the easiest and quickest way of getting rid of you.\" The\nPalainian spread a completely detailed chart in Samms' mind, snapped\nthe telepathic line, and went unconcernedly about her incomprehensible\nbusiness.\n\nSamms, mind reeling, made his way back to his boat and took off.\nAnd as the light-years and the parsecs screamed past, he sank\ndeeper and deeper into a welter of unproductive speculation. What\nwere--really--those Palainians? How could they--really--exist as they\nseemed to exist? And why had some of that dexitroboper's--whatever\n_that_ meant!--thoughts come in so beautifully sharp and clear and\nplain while others...?\n\nHe knew that his Lens would receive and would convert into his own\nsymbology any thought or message, however coded or garbled or however\nsent or transmitted. The Lens was not at fault; his symbology was.\nThere were concepts--things--actualities--occurrences--so foreign to\nTellurian experience that no referents existed. Hence the human mind\nlacked the channels, the mechanisms, to grasp them.\n\nHe and Roderick Kinnison had glibly discussed the possibility of\nencountering forms of intelligent life so alien that humanity would\nhave no point whatever of contact with them. After what Samms had\njust gone through, that was more of a possibility than either he or\nhis friend had believed; and he hoped grimly, as he considered how\nseriously this partial contact with the Palainian had upset him, that\nthe possibility would never become a fact.\n\nHe found the Palainian system easily enough, and Palain Seven. That\nplanet, of course, was almost as dark upon its sunward side as upon\nthe other, and its inhabitants had no use for light. Pilinipsi's\ninstructions, however, had been minute and exact; hence Samms had\nvery little trouble in locating the principal city--or, rather, the\nprincipal village, since there were no real cities. He found the\nplanet's one spaceport. What a thing to call a _port_! He checked\nback; recalled exactly this part of his interview with Pluto's Chief\nDexitroboper.\n\n\"The place upon which space-ships land,\" had been her thought, when she\nshowed him exactly where it was in relationship to the town. Just that,\nand nothing else. It had been his mind, not hers, that had supplied the\ndocks and cradles, the service cars, the officers, and all the other\nthings taken for granted in space-fields everywhere as Samms knew them.\nEither the Palainian had not perceived the trappings with which Samms\nhad invested her visualization, or she had not cared enough about his\nmisapprehension to go to the trouble of correcting it; he did not know\nwhich.\n\nThe whole area was as bare as his hand. Except for the pitted,\nscarred, slagged-down spots which showed so clearly what driving blasts\nwould do to such inconceivably cold rock and metal, Palainport was\nin no way distinguishable from any other unimproved portion of the\nplanet's utterly bleak surface.\n\nThere were no signals; he had been told of no landing conventions.\nApparently it was everyone for himself. Wherefore Samms' tremendous\nlanding lights blazed out, and with their aid he came safely to ground.\nHe put on his armour and strode to the air-lock; then changed his\nmind and went to the cargo-port instead. He had intended to walk, but\nin view of the rugged and deserted field and the completely unknown\nterrain between the field and the town, he decided to ride the \"creep\"\ninstead.\n\nThis vehicle, while slow, could go--literally--anywhere. It had a\ncigar-shaped body of magnalloy; it had big, soft, tough tires; it\nhad cleated tracks; it had air- and water-propellers; it had folding\nwings; it had driving, braking, and steering jets. It could traverse\nthe deserts of Mars, the oceans and swamps of Venus, the crevassed\nglaciers of Earth, the jagged, frigid surface of an iron asteroid, and\nthe cratered, fluffy topography of the moon; if not with equal speed,\nat least with equal safety.\n\nSamms released the thing and drove it into the cargo lock, noting\nmentally that he would have to exhaust the air of that lock into space\nbefore he again broke the inner seal. The ramp slid back into the ship;\nthe cargo port closed. Here he was!\n\nShould he use his headlights, or not? He did not know the Palainians'\nreaction to or attitude toward light. It had not occurred to him\nwhile at Pluto to ask, and it might be important. The landing lights\nof his vessel might already have done his cause irreparable harm. He\ncould drive by starlight if he had to ... but he needed light and he\nhad not seen a single living or moving thing. There was no evidence\nthat there was a Palainian within miles. While he had known, with his\nbrain, that Palain would be dark, he had expected to find buildings and\ntraffic--ground-cars, planes, and at least a few space-ships--and not\nthis vast nothingness.\n\nIf nothing else, there _must_ be a road from Palain's principal city to\nits only spaceport; but Samms had not seen it from his vessel and he\ncould not see it now. At least, he could not recognize it. Wherefore he\nclutched in the tractor drive and took off in a straight line toward\ntown. The going was more than rough--it was really rugged--but the\ncreep was built to stand up under punishment and its pilot's chair\nwas sprung and cushioned to exactly the same degree. Hence, while the\ncourse itself was infinitely worse than the smoothly paved approaches\nto Rigelston, Samms found this trip much less bruising than the other\nhad been.\n\nApproaching the village, he dimmed his roadlights and slowed down. At\nits edge he cut them entirely and inched his way forward by starlight\nalone.\n\nWhat a town! Virgil Samms had seen the inhabited places of almost\nevery planet of Civilization. He had seen cities laid out in circles,\nsectors, ellipses, triangles, squares, parallelopipeds--practically\nevery plan known to geometry. He had seen structures of all shapes\nand sizes--narrow skyscrapers, vast-spreading one-stories, polyhedra,\ndomes, spheres, semi-cylinders, and erect and inverted full and\ntruncated cones and pyramids. Whatever the plan or the shapes of\nthe component units, however, those inhabited places had, without\nexception, been understandable. But this!\n\nSamms, his eyes now completely dark-accustomed, could see fairly\nwell, but the more he saw the less he grasped. There was no plan, no\ncoherence or unity whatever. It was as though a cosmic hand had flung a\nfew hundreds of buildings, of incredibly and senselessly varied shapes\nand sizes and architectures, upon an otherwise empty plain, and as\nthough each structure had been allowed ever since to remain in whatever\nlocation and attitude it had chanced to fall. Here and there were\njumbled piles of three or more utterly incongruous structures. There\nwere a few whose arrangement was almost orderly. Here and there were\nlarge, irregularly-shaped areas of bare, untouched ground. There were\nno streets--at least, nothing that the man could recognize as such.\n\nSamms headed the creep for one of those open areas, then\nstopped--declutched the tracks, set the brakes, and killed the engines.\n\n\"Go slow, fellow,\" he advised himself then. \"Until you find out what\na dexitroboper actually does while working at his trade, don't take\nchances of interfering or of doing damage!\"\n\nNo Lensman knew--then--that frigid-blooded poison-breathers were not\nstrictly three-dimensional; but Samms did know that he had actually\nseen things which he could not understand. He and Kinnison had\ndiscussed such occurrences calmly enough; but the actuality was enough\nto shake even the mind of Civilization's First Lensman.\n\nHe did not need to be any closer, anyway. He had learned the\nPalainians' patterns well enough to Lens them from a vastly greater\ndistance than his present one; this personal visit to Palainopolis had\nbeen a gesture of friendliness, not a necessity.\n\n\"Tallick? Kragzex?\" He sent out the questing, querying thought.\n\"Lensman Virgil Samms of Sol Three calling Tallick and Kragzex of\nPalain Seven.\"\n\n\"Kragzex acknowledging, Virgil Samms,\" a thought snapped back, as\ndiamond-clear, as precise, as Pilinipsi's had been.\n\n\"Is Tallick here, or anywhere on the planet?\"\n\n\"He is here, but he is emmfozing at the moment. He will join us\npresently.\"\n\nDamnation! There it was again! First \"dexitroboping\", and now this!\n\n\"One moment, please,\" Samms requested. \"I fail to grasp the meaning of\nyour thought.\"\n\n\"So I perceive. The fault is of course mine, in not being able to\nattune my mind fully to yours. Do not take this, please, as any\naspersion upon the character or strength of your own mind.\"\n\n\"Of course not. I am the first Tellurian you have met?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I have exchanged thoughts with one other Palainian, and the same\ndifficulty existed. I can neither understand nor explain it; but it is\nas though there are differences between us so fundamental that in some\nmatters mutual comprehension is in fact impossible.\"\n\n\"A masterly summation and undoubtedly a true one. This emmfozing,\nthen--if I read correctly, your race has only two sexes?\"\n\n\"You read correctly.\"\n\n\"I cannot understand. There is no close analogy. However, emmfozing has\nto do with reproduction.\"\n\n\"I see,\" and Samms saw, not only a frankness brand-new to his\nexperience, but also a new view of both the powers and the limitations\nof his Lens.\n\nIt was, by its very nature, of precisionist grade. It received thoughts\nand translated them precisely into English. There was some leeway, but\nnot much. If any thought was such that there was no extremely close\ncounterpart or referent in English, the Lens would not translate it at\nall, but would simply give it a hitherto meaningless symbol--a symbol\nwhich would from that time on be associated, by all Lenses everywhere,\nwith that one concept and no other. Samms realized then that he might,\nsome day, learn what a dexitroboper actually did and what the act of\nemmfozing actually was; but that he very probably would not.\n\nTallick joined them then, and Samms again described glowingly, as he\nhad done so many times before, the Galactic Patrol of his imaginings\nand plannings. Kragzex refused to have anything to do with such\na thing, almost as abruptly as Pilinipsi had done, but Tallick\nlingered--and wavered.\n\n\"It is widely known that I am not entirely sane,\" he admitted, \"which\nmay explain the fact that I would very much like to have a Lens. But I\ngather, from what you have said, that I would probably not be given a\nLens to use purely for my own selfish purposes?\"\n\n\"That is my understanding,\" Samms agreed.\n\n\"I was afraid so.\" Tallick's mien was ... \"woebegone\" is the only word\nfor it. \"I have work to do. Projects, you know, of difficulty, of\nextreme complexity and scope, sometimes even approaching danger. A Lens\nwould be of tremendous use.\"\n\n\"How?\" Samms asked. \"If your work is of enough importance to enough\npeople, Mentor would certainly give you a Lens.\"\n\n\"This would benefit me; only me. We of Palain, as you probably already\nknow, are selfish, mean-spirited, small-souled, cowardly, furtive, and\nsly. Of what you call 'bravery' we have no trace. We attain our ends by\nstealth, by indirection, by trickery and deceit.\" Ruthlessly the Lens\nwas giving Virgil Samms the uncompromisingly exact English equivalent\nof the Palainian's every thought. \"We operate, when we must operate at\nall openly, with the absolutely irreducible minimum of personal risk.\nThese attitudes and attributes will, I have no doubt, preclude all\npossibility of Lensmanship for me and for every member of my race.\"\n\n\"Not necessarily.\"\n\n_Not necessarily!_ Although Virgil Samms did not know it, this was\none of the really critical moments in the coming into being of the\nGalactic Patrol. By a conscious, a tremendous effort, the First Lensman\nwas lifting himself above the narrow, intolerant prejudices of human\nexperience and was consciously attempting to see the whole through\nMentor's Arisian mind instead of through his Tellurian own. That\nVirgil Samms was the first human being to be born with the ability to\naccomplish that feat even partially was one of the reasons why he was\nthe first wearer of the Lens.\n\n\"Not necessarily,\" First Lensman Virgil Samms said and meant. He was\ninexpressibly shocked--revolted in every human fiber--by what this\nunhuman monster had so frankly and callously thought. There were,\nhowever, many things which no human being ever could understand, and\nthere was not the shadow of a doubt that this Tallick had a really\ntremendous mind. \"You have said that your mind is feeble. If so, there\nis no simple expression of the weakness of mine. I can perceive only\none, the strictly human, facet of the truth. In a broader view it is\ndistinctly possible that your motivation is at least as 'noble' as\nmine. And to complete my argument, you work with other Palainians, do\nyou not, to reach a common goal?\"\n\n\"At times, yes.\"\n\n\"Then you can conceive of the desirability of working with\nnon-Palainian entities toward an end which would benefit both races?\"\n\n\"Postulating such an end, yes; but I am unable to visualize any such.\nHave you any specific project in mind?\"\n\n\"Not at the moment.\" Samms ducked. He had already fired every shot in\nhis locker. \"I am quite certain, however, that if you go to Arisia you\nwill be informed of several such projects.\"\n\nThere was a period of silence. Then:\n\n\"I believe that I _will_ go to Arisia, at that!\" Tallick exclaimed,\nbrightly. \"I will make a deal with your friend Mentor. I will give him\na share--say fifty percent, or forty--of the time and effort I save on\nmy own projects!\"\n\n\"Just so you _go_, Tallick.\" Samms concealed right manfully his real\nopinion of the Palainian's scheme. \"When can you go? Right now?\"\n\n\"By no means. I must first finish this project. A year, perhaps--or\nmore; or possibly less. Who knows?\"\n\nTallick cut communications and Samms frowned. He did not know the\nexact length of Seven's year, but he knew that it was long--_very_\nlong.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11\n\n\nA small, black scout-ship, commanded jointly by Master Pilot John K.\nKinnison and Master Electronicist Mason M. Northrop, was blasting along\na course very close indeed to RA17: D+10. In equipment and personnel,\nhowever, she was not an ordinary scout. Her control room was so full\nof electronics racks and computing machines that there was scarcely\nfootway in any direction; her graduated circles and vernier scales\nwere of a size and a fineness usually seen only in the great vessels\nof the Galactic Survey. And her crew, instead of the usual twenty-odd\nmen, numbered only seven--one cook, three engineers, and three watch\nofficers. For some time the young Third Officer, then at the board,\nhad been studying something on his plate; comparing it minutely with\nthe chart clipped into the rack in front of him. Now he turned, with a\nhighly exaggerated deference, to the two Lensmen.\n\n\"Sirs, which of your Magnificences is officially the commander of this\nhere bucket of odds and ends at the present instant?\"\n\n\"Him.\" Jack used his cigarette as a pointer. \"The guy with the\nmisplaced plucked eyebrow on his upper lip. I don't come on duty until\nsixteen hundred hours--one precious Tellurian minute yet in which to\ndream of the beauties of Earth so distant in space and in both past and\nfuture time.\"\n\n\"Huh? Beauties? Plural? Next time I see a party whose pictures are\ncluttering up this whole ship I'll tell her about your polygamous\nideas. I'll ignore that crack about my mustache, though, since you\ncan't raise one of your own. I'm ignoring you, too--like this, see?\"\nOstentatiously turning his back upon the lounging Kinnison, Northrop\nstepped carefully over three or four breadboard hookups and stared into\nthe plate over the watch officer's shoulder. He then studied the chart.\n\"_Was ist los_, Stu? I don't see a thing.\"\n\n\"More Jack's line than yours, Mase. This system we're headed for is a\ntriple, and the chart says it's a double. Natural enough, of course.\nThis whole region is unexplored, so the charts are astronomicals,\nnot surveys. But that makes us Prime Discoverers, and our Commanding\nOfficer--and the book says 'Officer', not 'Officers'--has got to....\"\n\n\"That's me, now,\" Jack announced, striding grandly toward the plate.\n\"Amscray, oobsbay. _I_ will name the baby. _I_ will report. _I_ will go\ndown in history....\"\n\n\"Bounce back, small fry. You weren't at the time of discovery.\"\nNorthrop placed a huge hand flat against Jack's face and pushed gently.\n\"You'll go down, sure enough--not in history, but from a knock on the\nknob--if you try to steal any thunder away from _me_. And besides,\nyou'd name it '_Dimples_'--what a _revolting_ thought!\"\n\n\"And what would you name it? '_Virgilia_', I suppose?\"\n\n\"Far from it, my boy.\" He had intended doing just that, but now he did\nnot quite dare. \"After our project, of course. The planet we're heading\nfor will be Zabriska; the suns will be A-, B-, and C-Zabriskae, in\norder of size; and the watch officer then on duty, Lieutenant L. Stuart\nRawlings, will engross these and all other pertinent data in the log.\nCan you classify 'em from here, Jack?\"\n\n\"I can make some guesses--close enough, probably, for Discovery work.\"\nThen, after a few minutes: \"Two giants, a blue-white and a bluish\nyellow; and a yellow dwarf.\"\n\n\"Dwarf in the Trojan?\"\n\n\"That would be my guess, since that is the only place it could stay\nvery long, but you can't tell much from one look. I can tell you one\nthing, though--unless your Zabriska is in a system straight beyond this\none, it's got to be a planet of the big fellow himself; and brother,\nthat sun is _hot_!\"\n\n\"It's got to be here, Jack. I haven't made _that_ big an error in\nreading a beam since I was a sophomore.\"\n\n\"I'll buy that ... well, we're close enough, I guess.\" Jack killed the\ndriving blasts, but not the Bergenholm; the inertialess vessel stopped\ninstantaneously in open space. \"Now we've got to find out which one of\nthose twelve or fifteen planets was on our line when that last message\nwas sent.... There, we're stable enough, I hope. Open your cameras,\nMase. Pull the first plate in fifteen minutes. That ought to give me\nenough track so I can start the job, since we're at a wide angle to\ntheir ecliptic.\"\n\nThe work went on for an hour or so. Then:\n\n\"Something coming from the direction of Tellus,\" the watch officer\nreported. \"Big and fast. Shall I hail her?\"\n\n\"Might as well,\" but the stranger hailed first.\n\n\"Space-ship _Chicago_, NA2AA, calling. Are you in trouble? Identify\nyourself, please.\"\n\n\"Space-ship NA774J acknowledging. No trouble....\"\n\n\"Northrop! Jack!\" came Virgil Samms' highly concerned thought. The\nsuperdreadnaught flashed alongside, a bare few hundred miles away, and\nstopped. \"Why did you stop _here_?\"\n\n\"This is where our signal came from, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" A hundred thoughts raced through Samms' mind, too fast and too\nfragmentary to be intelligible. \"I see you're computing. Would it throw\nyou off too much to go inert and match intrinsics, so that I can join\nyou?\"\n\n\"No sir; I've got everything I need for a while.\"\n\nSamms came aboard; three Lensmen studied the chart.\n\n\"Cavenda is there,\" Samms pointed out. \"Trenco is there, off to one\nside. I felt sure that your signal originated on Cavenda; but Zabriska,\nhere, while on almost the same line, is less than half as far from\nTellus.\" He did not ask whether the two young Lensmen were sure of\ntheir findings. He knew. \"This arouses my curiosity no end--does it\nmerely complicate the thionite problem, or does it set up an entirely\nnew problem? Go ahead, boys, with whatever you were going to do next.\"\n\nJack had already determined that the planet they wanted was the second\nout; A-Zabriskae Two. He drove the scout as close to the planet as he\ncould without losing complete coverage; stationed it on the line toward\nSol.\n\n\"Now we wait a bit,\" he answered. \"According to recent periodicity, not\nless than four hours and not more than ten. With the next signal we'll\nnail that transmitter down to within a few feet. Got your spotting\nscreens full out, Mase?\"\n\n\"_Recent_ periodicity?\" Samms snapped. \"It has improved, then, lately?\"\n\n\"Very much, sir.\"\n\n\"That helps immensely. With George Olmstead harvesting broadleaf, it\nwould. It is still one problem. While we wait, shall we study the\nplanet a little?\"\n\nThey explored; finding that A-Zabriskae Two was a disappointing planet\nindeed. It was small, waterless, airless, utterly featureless, utterly\nbarren. There were no elevations, no depressions, no visible markings\nwhatever--not even a meteor crater. Every square yard of its surface\nwas apparently exactly like every other.\n\n\"No rotation,\" Jack reported, looking up from the bolometer. \"That\nsand-pile is not inhabited and never will be. I'm beginning to wonder.\"\n\n\"So am I, now,\" Northrop admitted. \"I still say that those signals came\nfrom this line and distance, but it looks as though they must have\nbeen sent from a ship. If so, now that we're here--particularly the\n_Chicago_--there will be no more signals.\"\n\n\"Not necessarily.\" Again Samms' mind transcended his Tellurian\nexperience and knowledge. He did not suspect the truth, but he was not\njumping at conclusions. \"There may be highly intelligent life, even\nupon such a planet as this.\"\n\nThey waited, and in a few hours a communications beam snapped into life.\n\n\"READY--READY--READY....\" it said briskly, for not quite one minute,\nbut that was time enough.\n\nNorthrop yelped a string of numbers; Jack blasted the little vessel\nforward and downward; the three watch officers, keen-eyed at their\nplates, stabbed their visibeams, ultra-beams, and spy-rays along the\nindicated line.\n\n\"And bore straight through the planet if you have to--they may be on\nthe other side!\" Jack cautioned, sharply.\n\n\"They aren't--it's here, on this side!\" Rawlings saw it first. \"Nothing\nmuch to it, though ... it looks like a relay station.\"\n\n\"A _relay_! I'll be a....\" Jack started to express an unexpurgated\nopinion, but shut himself up. Young cubs did not swear in front of the\nFirst Lensman. \"Let's land, sir, and look the place over, anyway.\"\n\n\"By all means.\"\n\nThey landed, and cautiously disembarked. The horizon, while actually\nquite a little closer than that of Earth, seemed much more distant\nbecause there was nothing whatever--no tree, no shrub, no rock or\npebble, not even the slightest ripple--to break the geometrical\nperfection of that surface of smooth, hard, blindingly reflective,\nfiendishly hot white sand. Samms was highly dubious at first--a\nground-temperature of four hundred seventy-five degrees was not to be\ntaken lightly; he did not at all like the looks of that ultra-fervent\nblue-white sun; and in his wildest imaginings he had never pictured\nsuch a desert. Their space-suits, however, were very well insulated,\nparticularly as to the feet, and highly polished; and in lieu of\natmosphere there was an almost perfect vacuum. They could stand it for\na while.\n\nThe box which housed the relay station was made of non-ferrous metal\nand was roughly cubical in shape, perhaps five feet on a side. It was\nso buried that its upper edge was flush with the surface; its top,\nwhich was practically indistinguishable from the surrounding sand, was\nnot bolted or welded, but was simply laid on, loose.\n\nPrevious spy-ray inspection having proved that the thing was not\nbooby-trapped, Jack lifted the cover by one edge and all three Lensmen\nstudied the mechanisms at close range; learning nothing new. There was\nan extremely sensitive non-directional receiver, a highly directional\nsender, a beautifully precise uranium-clock director, and an \"eternal\"\npowerpack. There was nothing else.\n\n\"What next, sir?\" Northrop asked. \"There'll be an incoming signal,\nprobably, in a couple of days. Shall we stick around and see whether it\ncomes in from Cavenda or not?\"\n\n\"You and Jack had better wait, yes.\" Samms thought for minutes. \"I do\nnot believe, now, that the signal will come from Cavenda, or that it\nwill ever come twice from the same direction, but we will have to make\nsure. But I can't see any _reason_ for it!\"\n\n\"I think I can, sir.\" This was Northrop's specialty. \"No space-ship\ncould possibly hit Tellus from here except by accident with a\nsingle-ended beam, and they can't use a double-ender because it would\nhave to be on all the time and would be as easy to trace as the\nMississippi River. But this planet did all its settling ages ago--which\nis undoubtedly why they picked it out--and that director in there is a\nMarchanti--the second Marchanti I have ever seen.\"\n\n\"Whatever _that_ is,\" Jack put in, and even Samms thought a question.\n\n\"The most precise thing ever built,\" the specialist explained.\n\"Accuracy limited only by that of determination of relative motions.\nGive me an accurate enough equation to feed into it, like that tape\nis doing, and two sighting shots, and I'll guarantee to pour an\neighteen-inch beam into any two foot cup on Earth. My guess is that\nit's aimed at some particular bucket-antenna on one of the Solar\nplanets. I could spoil its aim easily enough, but I don't suppose that\nis what you're after.\"\n\n\"Decidedly not. We want to trace them, without exciting any more\nsuspicion than is absolutely necessary. How often, would you say, do\nthey have to come here to service this station--change tapes, and\nwhatever else might be necessary?\"\n\n\"Change tapes, is all. Not very often, by the size of those reels. If\nthey know the relative motions exactly enough, they could compute as\nfar ahead as they care to. I've been timing that reel--it's got pretty\nclose to three months left on it.\"\n\n\"And more than that much has been used. It's no wonder we didn't see\nanything.\" Samms straightened up and stared out across the frightful\nwaste. \"Look there--I thought I saw something move--it _is_ moving!\"\n\n\"There's something moving closer than that, and it's really funny.\"\nJack laughed deeply. \"It's like the paddle-wheels, shaft and all, of an\nold-fashioned river steam-boat, rolling along as unconcernedly as you\nplease. He won't miss me by over four feet, but he isn't swerving a\nhair. I think I'll block him off, just to see what he does.\"\n\n\"Be careful, Jack!\" Samms cautioned, sharply. \"Don't touch it--it may\nbe charged, or worse.\"\n\nJack took the metal cover, which he was still holding, and by working\nit back and forth edgewise in the sand, made of it a vertical barrier\nsquarely across the thing's path. The traveler paid no attention, did\nnot alter its steady pace of a couple of miles per hour. It measured\nabout twelve inches long over all; its paddle-wheel-like extremities\nwere perhaps two inches wide and three inches in diameter.\n\n\"Do you think it's actually _alive_, sir? In a place like this?\"\n\n\"I'm sure of it. Watch carefully.\"\n\nIt struck the barrier and stopped. That is, its forward motion stopped,\nbut its rolling did not. Its rate of revolution did not change; it\neither did not know or did not care that its drivers were slipping\non the smooth, hard sand; that it could not climb the vertical metal\nplate; that it was not getting anywhere.\n\n\"What a brain!\" Northrop chortled, squatting down closer. \"Why doesn't\nit back up or turn around? It may be alive, but it certainly isn't very\nbright.\"\n\nThe creature, now in the shadow of the 'Troncist's helmet, slowed down\nabruptly--went limp--collapsed.\n\n\"Get out of his light!\" Jack snapped, and pushed his friend\nviolently away; and as the vicious sunlight struck it, the native\nrevived and began to revolve as vigorously as before. \"I've got\na hunch. Sounds screwy--never heard of such a thing--but it acts\nlike an energy-converter. Eats energy, raw and straight. No storage\ncapacity--on this world he wouldn't need it--a few more seconds in\nthe shade would probably have killed him, but there's no shade here.\nTherefore, he can't be dangerous.\"\n\nHe reached out and touched the middle of the revolving shaft. Nothing\nhappened. He turned it at right angles to the plate. The thing rolled\naway in a straight line, perfectly contented with the new direction. He\nrecaptured it and stuck a test-prod lightly into the sand, just ahead\nof its shaft and just inside one paddle wheel. Around and around that\nslim wire the creature went: unable, it seemed, to escape from even\nsuch a simple trap; perfectly willing, it seemed, to spend all the rest\nof its life traversing that tiny circle.\n\n\"'What a brain!' is right, Mase,\" Jack exclaimed. \"_What_ a brain!\"\n\n\"This is wonderful, boys, really wonderful; something completely new to\nour science.\" Samms' thought was deep with feeling. \"I am going to see\nif I can reach its mind or consciousness. Would you like to come along?\"\n\n\"_Would_ we!\"\n\nSamms tuned low and probed; lower and lower; deeper and deeper; and\nJack and Mase stayed with him. The thing was certainly alive; it\nthrobbed and vibrated with vitality: equally certainly, it was not\nvery intelligent. But it had a definite consciousness of its own\nexistence; and therefore, however tiny and primitive, a mind. Although\nits rudimentary ego could neither receive nor transmit thought, it knew\nthat it was a fontema, that it must roll and roll and roll, endlessly,\nthat by virtue of determined rolling its species would continue and\nwould increase.\n\n\"Well, that's one for the book!\" Jack exclaimed, but Samms was\nentranced.\n\n\"I would like to find one or two more of them, to find out ... I think\nI'll _take_ the time. Can you see any more of them, either of you?\"\n\n\"No, but we can find some--Stu!\" Northrop called.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Look around, will you? Find us a couple more of these fontema things\nand flick them over here with a tractor.\"\n\n\"Coming up!\" and in a few seconds they were there.\n\n\"Are you photographing this, Lance?\" Samms called the Chief\nCommunications Officer of the _Chicago_.\n\n\"We certainly are, sir--all of it. What are they, anyway? Animal,\nvegetable, or mineral?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Probably no one of the three, strictly speaking. I'd\nlike to take a couple back to Tellus, but I'm afraid that they'd die,\neven under an atomic lamp. We'll report to the Society.\"\n\nJack liberated his captive and aimed it to pass within a few feet of\none of the newcomers, but the two fontemas did not ignore each other.\nBoth swerved, so that they came together wheel to wheel. The shafts\nbent toward each other, each into a right angle. The angles touched and\nfused. The point of fusion swelled rapidly into a double fist-sized\nlump. The half-shafts doubled in length. The lump split into four;\nbecame four perfect paddle-wheels. Four full-grown fontemas rolled\naway from the spot upon which two had met; their courses forming two\nmutually perpendicular straight lines.\n\n\"Beautiful!\" Samms exclaimed. \"And notice, boys, the method of avoiding\ninbreeding. Upon a perfectly smooth planet such as this, no two of\nthose four can ever meet, and the chance is almost vanishingly small\nthat any of their first-generation offspring will ever meet. But I'm\nafraid I've been wasting time. Take me back out to the _Chicago_,\nplease, and I'll be on my way.\"\n\n\"You don't seem at all optimistic, sir,\" Jack ventured, as the NA774J\napproached the _Chicago_.\n\n\"Unfortunately, I am not. The signal will almost certainly come in\nfrom an unpredictable direction, from a ship so far away that even a\nsuper-fast cruiser could not get close enough to her to detect--just a\nminute. Rod!\" He Lensed the elder Kinnison so sharply that both young\nLensmen jumped.\n\n\"What is it, Virge?\"\n\nSamms explained rapidly, concluding: \"So I would like to have you throw\na globe of scouts around this whole Zabriskan system. One detet[A] out\nand one detet apart, so as to be able to slap a tracer onto any ship\nlaying a beam to this planet, from any direction whatever. It would not\ntake too many scouts, would it?\"\n\n[Footnote A: Detet--the distance at which one space-ship can detect\nanother. EES.]\n\n\"No; but it wouldn't be worth while.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because it wouldn't prove a thing except what we already know--that\nSpaceways is involved in the thionite racket. The ship would be clean.\nMerely another relay.\"\n\n\"Oh. You're probably right.\" If Virgil Samms was in the least put out\nat this cavalier dismissal of his idea, he made no sign. He thought\nintensely for a couple of minutes. \"You _are_ right. I will have to\nwork from the Cavenda end. How are you coming with Operation Bennett?\"\n\n\"Nice!\" Kinnison enthused. \"When you get a couple of days, come over\nand see it grow. This is a fine world, Virge--it'll be ready!\"\n\n\"I'll do that.\" Samms broke the connection and called Dronvire.\n\n\"The only change here is for the worse,\" the Rigellian reported,\ntersely. \"The slight positive correlation between deaths from thionite\nand the arrival of Spaceways vessels has disappeared.\"\n\nThere was no need to elaborate on that bare statement. Both Lensmen\nknew what it meant. The enemy, either in anticipation of statistical\nanalysis or for economic reasons, was rationing his small supply of the\ndrug.\n\nAnd DalNalten was very much unlike his usual equable self. He was glum\nand unhappy; so much so that it took much urging to make him report at\nall.\n\n\"We have, as you know, put our best operatives to work on the\ninter-planetary lines,\" he said finally, half sullenly. \"We have\nsecured quite a little data. The accumulating facts, however, point\nmore and more definitely toward an utterly preposterous conclusion. Can\nyou think of any valid reason why the exports and imports of thionite\nbetween Tellus and Mars, Mars and Venus, and Venus and Tellus, should\nall be exactly equal to each other?\"\n\n\"_What!_\"\n\n\"Precisely. That is why Knobos and I are not yet ready to present even\na preliminary report.\"\n\nThen Jill. \"I can't prove it, any more than I could before, but I'm\npretty sure that Morgan is the Boss. I have drawn every picture I can\nthink of with Isaacson in the driver's seat, but none of them fit?\" She\npaused, questioningly.\n\n\"I am already reconciled to adopting that view; at least as a working\nhypothesis. Go ahead.\"\n\n\"The fact seems to be that Morgan has always had all the left-wingers\nof the Nationalists under his thumb. Now he and his man Friday,\nRepresentative Flierce, are wooing all the radicals and so-called\nliberals on our side of both Senate and House--a new technique for\nhim--and they're offering plenty of the right kind of bait. He has the\ncommentators guessing, but there's no doubt whatever in my mind that he\nis aiming at next Election Day and our Galactic Council.\"\n\n\"And you and Dronvire are sitting idly by, doing nothing, of course?\"\n\n\"Of course!\" Jill giggled, but sobered quickly. \"He's a smooth,\n_smooth_ worker, Dad. We are organizing, of course, and putting out\npropaganda of our own, but there's so pitifully little that we can\nactually _do_--look and listen to this for a minute, and you'll see\nwhat I mean.\"\n\nIn her distant room Jill manipulated a reel and flipped a switch. A\nplate came to life, showing Morgan's big, sweating, passionately\nearnest face.\n\n\"... and who _are_ these Lensmen, anyway?\" Morgan's voice bellowed,\npassionate conviction in every syllable. \"They are the hired minions\nof the classes, stabbers in the back, crooks and scoundrels, TOOLS OF\nRUTHLESS WEALTH! They are hirelings of the inter-planetary bankers,\nthose unspeakable excrescences on the body politic who are still\ngrinding down into the dirt, under an iron heel, the face of the common\nman! In the guise of democracy they are trying to set up the worst, the\nmost outrageous tyranny that this universe has ever....\" Jill snapped\nthe switch viciously.\n\n\"And a lot of people _swallow_ that ... that _bilge_!\" she almost\nsnarled. \"If they had the brains of a ... of even that Zabriskan\nfontema Mase told me about, they wouldn't, but they _do_!\"\n\n\"I know they do. We have known all along that he is a masterly actor;\nwe now know that he is more than that.\"\n\n\"Yes, and we're finding out that no appeal to reason, no psychological\ncounter-measures, will work. Dronvire and I agree that you'll _have_ to\narrange matters so that you can do solid months of stumping yourself.\nPersonally.\"\n\n\"It may come to that, but there's a lot of other things to do first.\"\n\nSamms broke the connection and thought. He did not consciously try to\nexclude the two youths, but his mind was working so fast and in such\na disjointed fashion that they could catch only a few fragments. The\nincomprehensible vastness of space--tracing--detection--Cavenda's one\ntiny, fast moving moon--back, and solidly, to DETECTION.\n\n\"Mase,\" Samms thought then, carefully. \"As a specialist in such\nthings, why is it that the detectors of the smallest scout--lifeboat,\neven--have practically the same range as those of the largest liners\nand battleships?\"\n\n\"Noise level and hash, sir, from the atomics.\"\n\n\"But can't they be screened out?\"\n\n\"Not entirely, sir, without blocking reception completely.\"\n\n\"I see. Suppose, then, that all atomics aboard were to be shut\ndown; that for the necessary heat and light we use electricity,\nfrom storage or primary batteries or from a generator driven by\nan internal-combustion motor or a heat-engine. Could the range of\ndetection then be increased?\"\n\n\"Tremendously, sir. My guess is that the limiting factor would then be\nthe cosmics.\"\n\n\"I hope you're right. While you are waiting for the next signal to\ncome in, you might work out a preliminary design for such a detector.\nIf, as I anticipate, this Zabriska proves to be a dead end, Operation\nZabriska ends here--becomes a part of Zwilnik--and you two will follow\nme at max to Tellus. You, Jack, are very badly needed on Operation\nBoskone. You and I, Mase, will make appropriate alterations aboard a\nJ-class vessel of the Patrol.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12\n\n\nApproaching Cavenda in his dead-black, converted scout-ship,\nVirgil Samms cut his drive, killed his atomics, and turned on\nhis super-powered detectors. For five full detets in every\ndirection--throughout a spherical volume over ten detets in\ndiameter--space was void of ships. Some activity was apparent upon the\nplanet dead ahead, but the First Lensman did not worry about that. The\ndrug-runners would of course have atomics in their plants, even if\nthere were no space-ships actually on the planet--which there probably\nwere. What he did worry about was detection. There would be plenty of\ndetectors, probably automatic; not only ordinary sub-ethereals, but\nelectros and radars as well.\n\nHe flashed up to within one and a quarter detets, stopped, and\nchecked again. Space was still empty. Then, after making a series of\nobservations, he went inert and established an intrinsic velocity\nwhich, he hoped, would be close enough. He again shut off his atomics\nand started the sixteen-cylinder Diesel engine which would do its best\nto replace them.\n\nThat best was none too good, but it would do. Besides driving the\nBergenholm it could furnish enough kilodynes of thrust to produce a\nvelocity many times greater than any attainable by inert matter. It\nused a lot of oxygen per minute, but it would not run for very many\nminutes. With her atomics out of action his ship would not register\nupon the plates of the long-range detectors universally used. Since she\nwas nevertheless traveling faster than light, neither electromagnetic\ndetector-webs nor radar could \"see\" her. Good enough.\n\nSamms was not the System's best computer, nor did he have the System's\nfinest instruments. His positional error could be corrected easily\nenough; but as he drove nearer and nearer to Cavenda, keeping, toward\nthe last, in line with its one small moon, he wondered more and more as\nto how much of an allowance he should make for error in his intrinsic,\nwhich he had set up practically by guess. And there was another\nvariable, the cut-off. He slowed down to just over one light; but even\nat that comparatively slow speed an error of one millisecond at cut-off\nmeant a displacement of two hundred miles! He switched the spotter into\nthe Berg's cut-off circuit, set it for three hundred miles, and waited\ntensely at his controls.\n\nThe relays clicked, the driving force expired, the vessel went inert.\nSamms' eyes, flashing from instrument to instrument, told him that\nmatters could have been worse. His intrinsic was neither straight\nup, as he had hoped, nor straight down, as he had feared, but almost\nexactly half-way between the two--straight out. He discovered that fact\njust in time; in another second or two he would have been out beyond\nthe moon's protecting bulk and thus detectable from Cavenda. He went\nfree, flashed back to the opposite boundary of his area of safety, went\ninert, and put the full power of the bellowing Diesel to the task of\nbucking down his erroneous intrinsic, losing altitude continuously.\nAgain and again he repeated the maneuver; and thus, grimly and\nstubbornly, he fought his ship to ground.\n\nHe was very glad to see that the surface of the satellite was rougher,\nrockier, ruggeder, and more cratered even than that of Earth's Luna.\nUpon such a terrain as this, it would be next to impossible to spot\neven a moving vessel--if it moved carefully.\n\nBy a series of short and careful inertialess hops--correcting his\nintrinsic velocity after each one by an inert collision with the\nground--he maneuvered his vessel into such a position that Cavenda's\nenormous globe hung directly overhead. Breathing a profoundly deep\nbreath of relief he killed the big engine, cut in his fully-charged\naccumulators, and turned on detector and spy-ray. He would see what he\ncould see.\n\nHis detectors showed that there was only one point of activity on the\nwhole planet. He located it precisely; then, after cutting his spy-ray\nto minimum power, he approached it gingerly, yard by yard. Stopped!\nAs he had more than half expected, there was a spy-ray block. A big\none, almost two miles in diameter. It would be almost directly beneath\nhim--or rather, almost straight overhead--in about three hours.\n\nSamms had brought along a telescope, considerably more powerful than\nthe telescopic visiplate of his scout. Since the surface gravity\nof this moon was low--scarcely one-fifth that of Earth--he had no\ndifficulty in lugging the parts out of the ship or in setting the thing\nup.\n\nBut even the telescope did not do much good. The moon was close\nto Cavenda, as astronomical distances go--but really worth-while\nastronomical optical instruments simply are not portable. Thus the\nLensman saw something that, by sufficient stretch of the imagination,\ncould have been a factory; and, eyes straining at the tantalizing\nlimit of visibility, he even made himself believe that he saw a\ntoothpick-shaped object and a darkly circular blob, either of which\ncould have been the space-ship of the outlaws. He was sure, however, of\ntwo facts. There were no real cities upon Cavenda. There were no modern\nspaceports, or even air-fields.\n\nHe dismounted the 'scope, stored it, set his detectors, and waited. He\nhad to sleep at times, of course; but any ordinary detector rig can\nbe set to sound off at any change in its status--and Samms' was no\nordinary rig. Wherefore, when the drug-mongers' vessel took off, Samms\nleft Cavenda as unobtrusively as he had approached it, and swung into\nthat vessel's line.\n\nSamms' strategy had been worked out long since. On his Diesel, at a\ndistance of just over one detet, he would follow the outlaw as fast as\nhe could; long enough to establish his line. He would then switch to\natomic drive and close up to between one and two detets; then again go\nonto Diesel for a check. He would keep this up for as long as might\nprove necessary.\n\nAs far as any of the Lensmen knew, Spaceways always used regular liners\nor freighters in this business, and this scout was much faster than\nany such vessel. And even if--highly improbable thought!--the enemy\nship was faster than his own, it would still be within range of _those_\ndetectors when it got to wherever it was that it was going. But how\nwrong Samms was!\n\nAt his first check, instead of being not over two detets away the\nquarry was three and a half; at the second the distance was four and a\nquarter; at the third, almost exactly five. Scowling, Samms watched the\nerstwhile brilliant point of light fade into darkness. That circular\nblob that he had almost seen, then, had been the space-ship, but it\nhad not been a sphere, as he had supposed. Instead, it had been a\ntear-drop; sticking, sharp tail down, in the ground. Ultra-fast. This\nwas the result. But ideas had blown up under him before, they probably\nwould again. He resumed atomic drive and made arrangements with the\nPort Admiral to rendezvous with him and the _Chicago_ at the earliest\npossible time.\n\n\"What is there along that line?\" he demanded of the superdreadnaught's\nChief Pilot, even before junction had been made.\n\n\"Nothing, sir, that we know of,\" that worthy reported, after studying\nhis charts.\n\nHe boarded the gigantic ship of war, and with Kinnison pored over those\nsame charts.\n\n\"Your best bet is Eridan, I think,\" Kinnison concluded finally. \"Not\ntoo near your line, but they could very easily figure that a one-day\ndogleg would be a good investment. And Spaceways owns it, you know,\nfrom core to planetary limits--the richest uranium mines in existence.\nMade to order. Nobody would suspect a uranium ship. How about throwing\na globe around Eridan?\"\n\nSamms thought for minutes. \"No ... not yet, at least. We don't know\nenough yet.\"\n\n\"I know it--that's why it looks to me like a good time and place\nto learn something,\" Kinnison argued. \"We know--almost know, at\nleast--that a super-fast ship, carrying thionite, has just landed\nthere. This is the hottest lead we've had. I say englobe the planet,\ndeclare martial law, and not let anything in or out until we find it.\nSomebody there must know something, a lot more than we do. I say hunt\nhim out and make him talk.\"\n\n\"You're just popping off, Rod. You know as well as I do that nabbing a\nfew of the small fry isn't enough. We can't move openly until we can\nstrike high.\"\n\n\"I suppose not,\" Kinnison grumbled. \"But we know so _damned_ little,\nVirge!\"\n\n\"Little enough,\" Samms agreed. \"Of the three main divisions, only\nthe political aspect is at all clear. In the drug division, we know\nwhere thionite comes from and where it is processed, and Eridan\nmay be--probably is--another link. On the other end, we know a lot\nof peddlers and a few middlemen--nobody higher. We have no actual\nknowledge whatever as to who the higher-ups are or how they work; and\nit's the bosses we want. Concerning the pirates, we know even less.\n'Murgatroyd' may be no more a man's name than 'zwilnik' is....\"\n\n\"Before you get too far away from the subject, what are you going to do\nabout Eridan?\"\n\n\"Nothing, for the moment, would be best, I believe. However, Knobos\nand DalNalten should switch their attention from Spaceways' passenger\nliners to the uranium ships from Eridan to all three of the inner\nplanets. Check?\"\n\n\"Check. Particularly since it explains so beautifully the\nmerry-go-round they have been on so long--chasing the same packages of\ndope backwards and forwards so many times that the corners of the boxes\ngot worn round. We've got to get the top men, and they're smart. Which\nreminds me--Morgan as Big Boss does not square up with the Morgan that\nyou and Fairchild smacked down so easily when he tried to investigate\nthe Hill. A loud-mouthed, chiseling politician might have a lock-box\nfull of documentary evidence about party bosses and power deals and\nchorus girls and Martian tekkyl coats, but the man we're after very\ndefinitely would not.\"\n\n\"You're telling me?\" This point was such a sore one that Samms relapsed\ninto idiom. \"The boys should have cracked that box a week ago, but they\nstruck a knot. I'll see if they know anything yet. Tune in, Rod. Ray!\"\nHe Lensed a thought at his cousin.\n\n\"Yes, Virge?\"\n\n\"Have you got a spy-ray into that lock-box yet?\"\n\n\"Glad you called. Yes, last night. Empty. Empty as a sub-deb's\nskull--except for an atomic-powered gimmick that it took Bergenholm's\nwhole laboratory almost a week to neutralize.\"\n\n\"I see. Thanks. Off.\" Samms turned to Kinnison. \"Well?\"\n\n\"Nice. A mighty smart operator.\" Kinnison gave credit ungrudgingly.\n\"Now I'll buy your picture--what a man! But now--and I've got my ears\npinned back--what was it you started to say about pirates?\"\n\n\"Just that we have very little to go on, except for the kind of stuff\nthey seem to like best, and the fact that even armed escorts have not\nbeen able to protect certain types of shipments of late. The escorts,\ntoo, have disappeared. But with these facts as bases, it seems to me\nthat we could arrange something, perhaps like this....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA fast, sleek freighter and a heavy battle-cruiser bored steadily\nthrough the inter-stellar void. The merchantman carried a fabulously\nvaluable cargo: not bullion or jewels or plate of price, but things\nliterally above price--machine tools of highest precision, delicate\noptical and electrical instruments, fine watches and chronometers. She\nalso carried First Lensman Virgil Samms.\n\nAnd aboard the war-ship there was Roderick Kinnison; for the first time\nin history a mere battle-cruiser bore a Port Admiral's flag.\n\nAs far as the detectors of those two ships could reach, space was\nempty of man-made craft; but the two Lensmen knew that they were not\nalone. One and one-half detets away, loafing along at the freighter's\nspeed and paralleling her course, in a hemispherical formation open to\nthe front, there flew six tremendous tear-drops; super-dreadnaughts\nof whose existence no Tellurian or Colonial government had even an\ninkling. They were the fastest and deadliest craft yet built by\nman--the first fruits of Operation Bennett. And they, too, carried\nLensmen--Costigan, Jack Kinnison, Northrop, Dronvire of Rigel Four,\nRodebush, and Cleveland. Nor was there need of detectors: the eight\nLensmen were in as close communication as though they had been standing\nin the same room.\n\n\"On your toes, men,\" came Samms' quiet thought. \"We are about to\npass within a few light-minutes of an uninhabited solar system. No\nTellurian-type planets at all. This may be it. Tune to Kinnison on one\nside and to your captains on the other. Take over, Rod.\"\n\nAt one instant the ether, for one full detet in every direction, was\nempty. In the next, three intensely brilliant spots of detection\nflashed into being, in line with the dead planet so invitingly close at\nhand.\n\nThis development came as a surprise, since only two raiders had been\nexpected: a battleship to take care of the escort, a cruiser to take\nthe merchantman. The fact that the pirates had become cautious or\nsuspicious and had sent three super-dreadnaughts on the mission,\nhowever, did not operate to change the Patrol's strategy; for Samms\nhad concluded, and Dronvire and Bergenholm and Rularion of Jupiter had\nagreed, that the real commander of the expedition would be aboard the\nvessel that attacked the freighter.\n\nIn the next instant, then--each Lensman saw what Roderick Kinnison\nsaw, in the very instant of his seeing it--six more points of hard,\nwhite light sprang into being upon the plates of guileful freighter and\ndecoying cruiser.\n\n\"Jack and Mase, take the leader!\" Kinnison snapped out the thought.\n\"Dronvire and Costigan, right wing--he's the one that's going after the\nfreighter. Fred and Lyman, left wing. Hipe!\"\n\nThe pirate ships flashed up, filling ether and sub-ether alike with\na solid mush of interference through which no call for help could be\ndriven; two super-dreadnaughts against the cruiser, one against the\nfreighter. The former, of course, had been expected to offer more\nthan a token resistance. Battle cruisers of the Patrol were powerful\nvessels, both on offense and defense, and it was a known and recognized\nfact that the men of the Patrol were _men_. The pirate commander who\nattacked the freighter, however, was a surprised pirate indeed. His\nfirst beam, directed well forward, well ahead of the precious cargo,\nshould have wrought the same havoc against screens and wall-shields and\nstructure as a white-hot poker would against a pat of luke-warm butter.\nPractically the whole nose-section, including the control room, should\nhave whiffed outward into space in gobbets and streamers of molten and\ngaseous metal. But nothing of the sort happened--this merchantman was\n_no_ push-over!\n\nNo ordinary screens protected that particular freighter and the person\nof First Lensman Samms--Roderick Kinnison had very thoroughly seen to\nthat. In sheer mass her screen generators out-weighed her entire cargo,\nheavy as that cargo was, by more than two to one. Thus the pirate's\nbeams stormed and struck and clawed and clung--uselessly. They did not\npenetrate. And as the surprised attacker shoved his power up and up,\nto his absolute ceiling of effort, the only result was to increase\nthe already tremendous pyrotechnic display of energies cascading in\nall directions from the fiercely radiant defenses of the Tellurian\nfreighter.\n\nAnd in a few seconds the commanding officers of the other two attacking\nbattleships were also surprised. The battle-cruiser's screens did not\ngo down, even under the combined top effort of two super-dreadnaughts!\nAnd she did not have a beam hot enough to light a match--she must be\n_all screen_! But before the startled outlaws could do anything about\nthe realization that they, instead of being the trappers, were in\ncold fact the trapped, all three of them were surprised again--the\nlast surprise that any of them was ever to receive. Six mighty\ntear-drops--vastly bigger, faster, more powerful than their own--were\nrushing upon them, blanketing all channels of communication as\nefficiently and as enthusiastically as they themselves had been doing\nan instant before.\n\nBeing out simply and ruthlessly to kill, and not to capture, four of\nthe newcomers from Bennett polished off the cruiser's two attackers\nin very short order. They simply flashed in, went inert at the four\ncorners of an imaginary tetrahedron, and threw everything they had--and\nthey had plenty. Possibly--just barely possibly--there may have been,\nsomewhere, a space-battle shorter than that one; but there certainly\nwas never one more violent.\n\nThen the four set out after their two sister-ships and the one\nremaining pirate, who was frantically devoting his every effort to the\navoidance of engagement. But with six ships, each one of which was of\nvastly greater individual power than his own, at the six corners of an\noctahedron of which he was the geometrical center, his ability to cut\ntractor beams and to \"squirt out\" from between two opposed pressors did\nhim no good whatever. He was englobed; or, rather, to apply the correct\nterminology to an operation involving so few units, he was \"boxed\".\n\nTo blow the one remaining raider out of the ether would have been\neasy enough, but that was exactly what the Patrolmen did not want\nto do. They wanted information. Wherefore each of the Patrol ships\ndirected a dozen or so beams upon the scintillating protective screens\nof the enemy; enough so that every square yard of defensive web was\nunder direct attack. As rapidly as it could be done without losing\nequilibrium or synchronization, the power of each beam was stepped\nup until the wildly violet incandescence of the pirate screen showed\nthat it was hovering on the very edge of failure. Then, in the\ninstant, needle-beamers went furiously to work. The screen was already\nloaded to its limit; no transfer of defensive energy was possible.\nThus, tremendously overloaded locally, locally it flared through the\nultra-violet into the black and went down; and the fiercely penetrant\ndaggers of pure force stabbed and stabbed and stabbed.\n\nThe engine room went first, even though the needlers had to gnaw a\nhundred-foot hole straight through the pirate craft in order to find\nthe vital installations. Then, enough damage done so that spy-rays\ncould get in, the rest of the work was done with precision and\ndispatch. In a matter of seconds the pirate hulk lay helpless, and the\nPatrolmen peeled her like an orange--or, rather, more like an amateur\ncook very wastefully peeling a potato. Resistless knives of energy\nsheared off tail-section and nose-section, top and bottom, port and\nstarboard sides; then slabbed off the corners of what was left, until\nthe control room was almost bared to space.\n\nThen, as soon as the intrinsic velocities could possibly be matched,\nboard and storm! With Dronvire of Rigel Four in the lead, closely\nfollowed by Costigan, Northrop, Kinnison the Younger, and a platoon of\narmed and armored Space Marines!\n\nSamms and the two scientists did not belong in such a melee as that\nwhich was to come, and knew it. Kinnison the Elder did not belong,\neither, but did not know it. In fact, he cursed fluently and bitterly\nat having to stay out--nevertheless, out he stayed.\n\nDronvire, on the other hand, did not like to fight. The very thought\nof actual, bodily, hand-to-hand combat revolted every fiber of his\nbeing. In view of what the spy-ray men were reporting, however, and of\nwhat all the Lensmen knew of pirate psychology, Dronvire had to get\ninto that control room first, and he had to get there _fast_. And if\nhe _had_ to fight, he could; and, physically, he was wonderfully well\nequipped for just such activity. To his immense physical strength, the\nnatural concomitant of a force of gravity more than twice Earth's,\nthe armor which so encumbered the Tellurian battlers was a scarcely\nnoticeable impediment. His sense of perception, which could not be\nbarred by any material substance, kept him fully informed of every\ndevelopment in his neighborhood. His literally incredible speed enabled\nhim not merely to parry a blow aimed at him, but to bash out the brains\nof the would-be attacker before that blow could be more than started.\nAnd whereas a human being can swing only one space-axe or fire only two\nray-guns at a time, the Rigellian plunged through space toward what\nwas left of the pirate vessel, swinging not one or two space-axes, but\nfour; each held in a lithe and supple, but immensely strong, tentacular\n\"hand\".\n\nWhy axes? Why not Lewistons, or rifles, or pistols? Because the space\narmor of that day could withstand almost indefinitely the output of two\nor three hand-held projectors; because the resistance of its defensive\nfields varied directly as the cube of the velocity of any material\nprojectile encountering them. Thus, and strangely enough, the advance\nof science had forced the re-adoption of that long-extinct weapon.\n\nMost of the pirates had died, of course, during the dismemberment of\ntheir ship. Many more had been picked off by the needle-beam gunners.\nIn the control room, however, there was a platoon of elite guards,\nclustered so closely about the commander and his officers that needles\ncould not be used; a group that would have to be wiped out by hand.\n\nIf the attack had come by way of the only doorway, so that the pirates\ncould have concentrated their weapons upon one or two Patrolmen, the\ncommander might have had time enough to do what he was under compulsion\nto do. But while the Patrolmen were still in space a plane of force\nsheared off the entire side of the room, a tractor beam jerked the\ndetached wall away, and the attackers floated in en masse.\n\nWeightless combat is not at all like any form of gymnastics known to\nus ground-grippers. It is much more difficult to master, and in times\nof stress the muscles revert involuntarily and embarrassingly to\ntheir wonted gravity-field techniques. Thus the endeavors of most of\nthe battlers upon both sides, while earnest enough and deadly enough\nof intent, were almost comically unproductive of result. In a matter\nof seconds frantically-struggling figures were floating from wall to\nceiling to wall to floor; striking wildly, darting backward from the\nviolence of their own fierce swings.\n\nThe Tellurian Lensmen, however, had had more practice and remembered\ntheir lessons better. Jack Kinnison, soaring into the room, grabbed\nthe first solid thing he could reach; a post. Pulling himself down to\nthe floor, he braced both feet, sighted past the nearest foeman, swung\nhis axe, and gave a tremendous shove. Such was his timing that in the\ninstant of maximum effort the beak of his atrociously effective weapon\nencountered the pirate's helmet--and that was that. He wrenched his axe\nfree and shoved the corpse away in such a direction that the reaction\nwould send him against a wall at the floor line, in position to repeat\nthe maneuver.\n\nSince Mason Northrop was heavier and stronger than his friend, his\ntechnique was markedly different. He dove for the chart-table, which\nof course was welded to the floor. He hooked one steel-shod foot\naround one of the table's legs and braced the other against its top.\nWeightless but inert, it made no difference whether his position was\nvertical or horizontal or anywhere between; from this point of vantage,\nwith his length of body and arm and axe, he could cover a lot of room.\nHe reached out, hooked bill of axe into belt or line-snap or angle of\narmor, and pulled; and as the helplessly raging pirate floated past\nhim, he swung and struck. And that, too, was that.\n\nDronvire of Rigel Four did not rush to the attack. He had never\nbeen and was not now either excited or angry. Indeed, it was only\nempirically that he knew what anger and excitement were. He had\nnever been in any kind of a fight. Therefore he paused for a couple\nof seconds to analyze the situation and to determine his own most\nefficient method of operation. He would not have to be in physical\ncontact with the pirate captain to go to work on his mind, but he would\nhave to be closer than this and he would have to be free from physical\nattack while he concentrated. He perceived what Kinnison and Costigan\nand Northrop were doing, and knew why each was working in a different\nfashion. He applied that knowledge to his own mass, to his own\nmusculature, to the length and strength of his arms--each one of which\nwas twice as long and ten times as strong as the trunk of an elephant.\nHe computed forces and leverages, actions and reactions, points of\napplication, stresses and strains.\n\nHe threw away two of his axes. The two empty arms reached out, each\ncurling around the neck of a pirate. Two axes flashed, grazing each\npinioning arm so nearly that it seemed incredible that the sharp\nedges did not shear away the Rigellian's own armor. Two heads floated\naway from two bodies and Dronvire reached for two more. And two--and\ntwo--and two. Calm and dispassionate, but not wasting a motion or a\nmillisecond, Dronvire accomplished more, in less time, than all the\nTellurians in the room.\n\n\"Costigan, Northrop, Kinnison--attend!\" he launched a thought. \"I\nhave no time to kill more of them. The commander is dying of a\nself-inflicted wound and I have important work to do. See to it,\nplease, that these remaining creatures do not attack me while I am\ndoing it.\"\n\nDronvire tuned his mind to that of the pirate and probed. Although\ndying, the pirate captain offered fierce resistance, but the Rigellian\nwas not alone. Attuned to his mind, working smoothly with it, giving\nit strengths and qualities which no Rigellian ever had had or ever\nwould have, were the two strongest minds of Earth: that of Rod the\nRock Kinnison, with the driving force, the indomitable will, the\ntranscendent urge of all human heredity; and that of Virgil Samms, with\nall that had made him First Lensman.\n\n\"TELL!\" that terrific triple mind demanded, with a force which simply\ncould not be denied. \"WHERE ARE YOU FROM? Resistance is useless; yours\nor that of those whom you serve. Your bases and powers are smaller and\nweaker than ours, since Spaceways is only a corporation and we are the\nGalactic Patrol. TELL! WHO ARE YOUR BOSSES? TELL--TELL!\"\n\nUnder that irresistible urge there appeared, foggily and without any\nhint of knowledge of name or of spatial co-ordinates, an embattled\nplanet, very similar in a smaller way to the Patrol's own Bennett, and--\n\nEven more foggily, but still not so blurred but that their features\nwere unmistakeably recognizable, the images of two men. That of\nMurgatroyd, the pirate chief, completely strange to both Kinnison and\nSamms; and--\n\nBack of Murgatroyd and above him, that of--\n\nBIG JIM TOWNE!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13\n\n\n\"First, about Murgatroyd.\" In his office in The Hill Roderick Kinnison\nspoke aloud to the First Lensman. \"What do you think should be done\nabout him?\"\n\n\"Murgatroyd. Hm ... m ... m.\" Samms inhaled a mouthful of smoke\nand exhaled it slowly; watched it dissipate in the air. \"Ah, yes,\nMurgatroyd.\" He repeated the performance. \"My thought, at the moment,\nis to let him alone.\"\n\n\"Check,\" Kinnison said. If Samms was surprised at his friend's\nconcurrence he did not show it. \"Why? Let's see if we check on that.\"\n\n\"Because he does not seem to be of fundamental importance. Even if we\ncould find him ... and by the way, what do you think the chance is of\nour spies finding him?\"\n\n\"Just about the same chance that theirs have of finding out about the\nSamms-Olmstead switch or our planet Bennett. Vanishingly small. Zero.\"\n\n\"Right. And even if we could find him--even find their secret base,\nwhich is certainly as well hidden as ours is--it would do us no present\ngood, because we could take no positive action. We have, I think,\nlearned the prime fact; that Towne is actually Murgatroyd's superior.\"\n\n\"That's the way I see it. We can almost draw an organization chart now.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't say 'almost'.\" Samms smiled half-ruefully. \"There are\ngaping holes, and Isaacson is as yet a highly unknown quantity.\nI've tried to draw one a dozen times, but we haven't got enough\ninformation. An incorrect chart, you know, would be worse than none\nat all. As soon as I can draw a correct one, I'll show it to you. But\nin the meantime, the position of our friend James F. Towne is now\nclear. He is actually a Big Shot in both piracy and politics. That fact\nsurprised me, even though it did clarify the picture tremendously.\"\n\n\"Me, too. One good thing, we won't have to hunt for him. You've been\nworking on him right along, though, haven't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, but this new relationship throws light on a good many details\nwhich have been obscure. It also tends to strengthen our working\nhypothesis as to Isaacson--which we can't prove yet, of course--that\nhe is the actual working head of the drug syndicate. Vice-President in\ncharge of Drugs, so to speak.\"\n\n\"Huh? That's a new one on me. I don't see it.\"\n\n\"There is very little doubt that at the top there is Morgan. He is,\nand has been for some time, the real boss of North America. Under him,\nprobably taking orders direct, is President Witherspoon.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly. The Nationalist party is strictly _a la_ machine, and\nWitherspoon is one of the world's slimiest skinkers. Morgan is Chief\nEngineer of the Machine. Take it from there.\"\n\n\"We know that Boss Jim is also in the top echelon--quite possibly the\nCommander-in-Chief--of the enemy's Armed Forces. By analogy, and since\nIsaacson is apparently on the same level as Towne, immediately below\nMorgan....\"\n\n\"Wouldn't there be three? Witherspoon?\"\n\n\"I doubt it. My present idea is that Witherspoon is at least one level\nlower. Comparatively small fry.\"\n\n\"Could be--I'll buy it. A nice picture, Virge; and beautifully\nsymmetrical. His Mightiness Morgan. Secretary of War Towne and\nSecretary of Drugs Isaacson; and each of them putting a heavy shoulder\nbehind the political bandwagon. _Very_ nice. That makes Operation\nMateese tougher than ever--a triple-distilled toughie. Glad I told you\nit wasn't my dish--saves me the trouble of backing out now.\"\n\n\"Yes, I have noticed how prone you are to duck tough jobs.\" Samms\nsmiled quietly. \"However, unless I am even more mistaken than usual,\nyou will be in it up to your not-so-small ears, my friend, before it is\nover.\"\n\n\"Huh? How?\" Kinnison demanded.\n\n\"That will, I hope, become clear very shortly.\" Samms stubbed out the\nbutt of his cigarette and lit another. \"The basic problem can be stated\nvery simply. How are we going to persuade the sovereign countries of\nEarth--particularly the North American Continent--to grant the Galactic\nPatrol the tremendous power and authority it will have to have?\"\n\n\"Nice phrasing, Virge, and studied. Not off the cuff. But aren't you\nover-drawing a bit? Little if any conflict. The Patrol would be pretty\nlargely inter-systemic in scope ... with of course the necessary\ninter-planetary and inter-continental ... and ... um ... m....\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"But it's logical enough, Virge, even at that, and has plenty\nof precedents, clear back to ancient history. 'Way back, before\nspace-travel, when they first started to use atomic energy, and the\nonly drugs they had to worry about were cocaine, morphine, heroin, and\nother purely Tellurian products. I was reading about it just the other\nday.\"\n\nKinnison swung around, fingered a book out of a matched set, and\nriffled its leaves. \"Russia was the world's problem child then--put up\nwhat they called an iron curtain--wouldn't play with the neighbors'\nchildren, but picked up her marbles and went home. But yet--here it is.\nOriginal source unknown--some indications point to a report of somebody\nnamed Hoover, sometime in the nineteen forties or fifties, Gregorian\ncalendar. Listen:\n\n\"'This protocol'--he's talking about the agreement on world-wide\nNarcotics Control--'was signed by fifty-two nations, including the\nU.S.S.R.'--that was Russia--'and its satellite states. It was the only\ninternational agreement to which the Communist countries'--you know\nmore about what Communism was, I suppose, than I do.\"\n\n\"Just that it was another form of dictatorship that didn't work out.\"\n\n\"'... to which the Communist countries ever gave more than lip service.\nThis adherence is all the more surprising, in view of the political\nsituation then obtaining, in that all signatory nations obligated\nthemselves to surrender national sovereignty in five highly significant\nrespects, as follows:\n\n\"'First, to permit Narcotics agents of all other signatory nations\nfree, secret, and unregistered entry into, unrestricted travel\nthroughout, and exit from, all their lands and waters, wherever situate:\n\n\"'Second, upon request, to allow known criminals and known contraband\nto enter and to leave their territories without interference:\n\n\"'Third, to cooperate fully, and as a secondary and not as a prime\nmover, in any Narcotics Patrol program set up by any other signatory\nnation:\n\n\"'Fourth, upon request, to maintain complete secrecy concerning any\nNarcotics operation: and\n\n\"'Fifth, to keep the Central Narcotics Authority fully and continuously\ninformed upon all matters hereinbefore specified.'\n\n\"And apparently, Virge, it worked. If they could do that, 'way back\nthen, we certainly should be able to make the Patrol work now.\"\n\n\"You talk as though the situations were comparable. They aren't.\nInstead of giving up an insignificant fraction of their national\nsovereignty, all nations will have to give up practically all of it.\nThey will have to change their thinking from a National to a Galactic\nviewpoint; will have to become units in a Galactic Civilization, just\nas counties used to be units of states, and states are units of the\ncontinents. The Galactic Patrol will not be able to stop at being the\nsupreme and only authority in inter-systemic affairs. It is bound\nto become intra-systemic, intra-planetary, and intra-continental.\nEventually, it must and it shall be the _sole_ authority, except for\nsuch purely local organizations as city police.\"\n\n\"_What_ a program!\" Kinnison thought silently for minutes. \"But I'm\nstill betting that you can bring it off.\"\n\n\"We'll keep on driving until we do. What gives us our chance is that\nthe all-Lensman Solarian Council is already in existence and is\nfunctioning smoothly; and that the government of North America has no\njurisdiction beyond the boundaries of its continent. Thus, and even\nthough Morgan has extra-legal powers both as Boss of North America\nand as the head of an organization which is in fact inter-systemic in\nscope, he can do nothing whatever about the fact that the Solarian\nCouncil has been enlarged into the Galactic Council. As a matter of\nfact, he was and is very much in favor of that particular move--just as\nmuch so as we are.\"\n\n\"You're going too fast for me. How do you figure that?\"\n\n\"Unlike our idea of the Patrol as a coordinator of free and independent\nraces, Morgan sees it as the perfect instrument of a Galactic\ndictatorship, thus: North America is the most powerful continent of\nEarth. The other continents will follow her lead--or else. Tellus can\nvery easily dominate the other Solarian planets, and the Solar System\ncan maintain dominance over all other systems as they are discovered\nand colonized. Therefore, whoever controls the North American Continent\ncontrols all space.\"\n\n\"I see. Could be, at that. Throw the Lensmen out, put his own stooges\nin. Wonder how he'll go about it? A _tour de force_? No. The next\nelection, would be my guess. If so, that will be the most important\nelection in history.\"\n\n\"If they decide to wait for the election, yes. I'm not as sure as you\nseem to be that they will not act sooner.\"\n\n\"They can't,\" Kinnison declared. \"Name me one thing they think they can\ndo, and I'll shoot it fuller of holes than a target.\"\n\n\"They can, and I am very much afraid that they will,\" Samms replied,\nsoberly. \"At any time he cares to do so, Morgan--through the North\nAmerican Government, of course--can abrogate the treaty and name his\nown Council.\"\n\n\"Without my boys--the backbone and the guts of North America, as well\nas of the Patrol? Don't be stupid, Virge. They're _loyal_.\"\n\n\"Admitted--but at the same time they are being paid in North American\ncurrency. Of course, we will soon have our own Galactic credit system\nworked out, but....\"\n\n\"What the hell difference would _that_ make?\" Kinnison wanted savagely\nto know. \"You think they'd last until the next pay-day if they start\nplaying that kind of ball? What in hell do you think _I'd_ be doing?\nAnd Clayton and Schweikert and the rest of the gang? Sitting on our fat\nrumps and crying into our beers?\"\n\n\"You would do nothing. I could not permit any illegal....\"\n\n\"Permit!\" Kinnison blazed, leaping to his feet. \"Permit--hell! Are\nyou loose-screwed enough to actually think I would ask or need your\npermission? Listen, Samms!\" The Port Admiral's voice took on a quality\nlike nothing his friend had ever before heard. \"The first thing I\nwould do would be to take off your Lens, wrap you up--especially your\nmouth--in seventeen yards of three-inch adhesive tape, and heave you\ninto the brig. The second would be to call out everything we've got,\nincluding every half-built ship on Bennett able to fly, and declare\nmartial law. The third would be a series of summary executions,\nstarting with Morgan and working down. And if he's got any fraction of\nthe brain I credit him with, Morgan knows damned well _exactly_ what\nwould happen.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Samms, while very much taken aback, was thrilled to the center of\nhis being. \"I had not considered anything so drastic, but you probably\nwould....\"\n\n\"Not 'probably',\" Kinnison corrected him grimly. \"'Certainly'.\"\n\n\"... and Morgan does know ... except about Bennett, of course ... and\nhe would not, for obvious reasons, bring in his secret armed forces.\nYou're right, Rod, it will be the election.\"\n\n\"Definitely; and it's plain enough what their basic strategy will\nbe.\" Kinnison, completely mollified, sat down and lit another cigar.\n\"His Nationalist party is now in power, but it was our Cosmocrats\nof the previous administration who so basely slipped one over on\nthe dear pee-pul--who betrayed the entire North American Continent\ninto the claws of rapacious wealth, no less--by ratifying that\nunlawful, unhallowed, unconstitutional, and so on, treaty. Scoundrels!\nBribe-takers! Betrayers of a sacred trust! _How_ Rabble-Rouser Morgan\nwill thump the tub on that theme--he'll make the welkin ring as it\nnever rang before.\"\n\nKinnison mimicked savagely the demagogue's round and purple tones as he\nwent on: \"'Since they had no mandate from the pee-pul to trade their\nbirthright for a mess of pottage that nefarious and underhanded treaty\nis, _a prima vista_ and _ipso facto_ and _a priori_, completely and\nnecessarily and positively null and void. People of Earth, arouse!\nArise! Rise in your might and throw off this stultifying and degrading,\nthis paralyzing yoke of the Monied Powers--throw out this dictatorial,\nautocratic, wealth-directed, illegal, monstrous Council of so-called\nLensmen! Rise in your might at the polls! Elect a Council of your own\nchoosing--not of Lensmen, but of ordinary folks like you and me. Throw\n_off_ this hellish yoke, I say!'--and here he begins to positively\nfroth at the mouth--'so that government of the people, by the people,\nand for the people shall not perish from the Earth!'\n\n\"He has used that exact peroration, ancient as it is, so many times\nthat practically everybody thinks he originated it; and it's always\ngood for so many decibels of applause that he'll keep on using it\nforever.\"\n\n\"Your analysis is vivid, cogent, and factual, Rod--but the situation is\nnot at all funny.\"\n\n\"Did I act as though I thought it was? If so, I'm a damned poor actor.\nI'd like to kick the bloodsucking leech all the way from here to the\nGreat Nebula in Andromeda, and if I ever get the chance I'm going to!\"\n\n\"An interesting, but somewhat irrelevant idea.\" Samms smiled at his\nfriend's passionate outburst. \"But go on. I agree with you in principle\nso far, and your viewpoint is--to say the least--refreshing.\"\n\n\"Well, Morgan will have so hypnotized most of the dear pee-pul that\nthey will think it their own idea when he re-nominates this spineless\nnincompoop Witherspoon for another term as President of North America,\nwith a solid machine-made slate of hatchet-men behind him. They win the\nelection. Then the government of the North American Continent--not the\nMorgan-Towne-Isaacson machine, but all nice and legal and by mandate\nand in strict accordance with the party platform--abrogates the treaty\nand names its own Council. And right then, my friend, the boys and I\nwill do our stuff.\"\n\n\"Except that, in such a case, you wouldn't. Think it over, Rod.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Kinnison demanded, in a voice which, however, did not carry\nmuch conviction.\n\n\"Because we would be in the wrong; and we are even less able to go\nagainst united public opinion than is the Morgan crowd.\"\n\n\"We'd do _something_--I've got it!\" Kinnison banged the desk with his\nfist. \"That would be a strictly unilateral action. North America would\nbe standing alone.\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"So we'll pull all the Cosmocrats and all of our friends out of North\nAmerica--move them to Bennett or somewhere--and make Morgan and Company\na present of it. We won't declare martial law or kill anybody, unless\nthey decide to call in their reserves. We'll merely isolate the whole\ndamned continent--throw a screen around it and over it that a microbe\nwon't be able to get through--one that would make that iron curtain I\nread about look like a bride's veil--and we'll _keep_ them isolated\nuntil they beg to join up on our terms. Strictly legal, and the perfect\nsolution. How about me giving the boys a briefing on it, right now?\"\n\n\"Not yet.\" Samms' mien, however, lightened markedly. \"I never thought\nof that way out.... It _could_ be done, and it would probably work, but\nI would not recommend it except as an ultimately last resort. It has at\nleast two tremendous drawbacks.\"\n\n\"I know it, but....\"\n\n\"It would wreck North America as no nation has ever been wrecked; quite\npossibly beyond recovery. Furthermore, how many people, including\nyourself and your children, would like to renounce their North American\ncitizenship and remove themselves, permanently and irrevocably, from\nNorth American soil?\"\n\n\"Um ... m ... m. Put that away, it doesn't sound so good, does it? But\nwhat the hell else can we do?\"\n\n\"Just what we have been planning on doing. We must win the election.\"\n\n\"Huh?\" Kinnison's mouth almost fell open. \"You say it easy. How? With\nwhom? By what stretch of the imagination do you figure that you can\nfind anybody with a loose enough mouth to out-lie and out-promise\nMorgan? And can you duplicate his machine?\"\n\n\"We can not only duplicate his machine; we can better it. The truth,\npresented to the people in language they can understand and appreciate,\nby a man whom they like, admire, and respect, will be more attractive\nthan Morgan's promises. The same truth will dispose of Morgan's lies.\"\n\n\"Well, go on. You've answered my questions, after a fashion, except the\nstinger. Does the Council think it's got a man with enough dynage to\nlift the load?\"\n\n\"Unanimously. They also agreed unanimously that we have only one.\nHaven't you any idea who he is?\"\n\n\"Not a glimmering of one.\" Kinnison frowned in thought, then his\nface cleared into a broad grin and he yelled: \"_What_ a damn fool I\nam--_you_, of course!\"\n\n\"Wrong. I was not even seriously considered. It was the concensus that\nI could not possibly win. My work has been such as to keep me out of\nthe public eye. If the man in the street thinks of me at all, he thinks\nthat I hold myself apart and above him--the ivory tower concept.\"\n\n\"Could be, at that; but you've got my curiosity aroused. How can a man\nof that caliber have been kicking around so long without me knowing\nanything about him?\"\n\n\"You do. That's what I've been working around to all afternoon. You.\"\n\n\"Huh?\" Kinnison gasped as though he had received a blow in the solar\nplexus. \"Me? ME? Hell's--Brazen--Hinges!\"\n\n\"Exactly. You.\" Silencing Kinnison's inarticulate protests, Samms went\non: \"First, you'll have no difficulty in talking to an audience as\nyou've just talked to me.\"\n\n\"Of course not--but did I use any language that would burn out the\ntransmitters? I don't remember whether I did or not.\"\n\n\"I don't, either. You probably did, but that would be nothing new.\nTelenews has never yet cut you off the ether because of it. The point\nis this: while you do not realize it, you are a better tub-thumper and\nwelkin-ringer than Morgan is, when something--such as just now--really\ngets you going. And as for a machine, what finer one is possible than\nthe Patrol? Everybody in it or connected with it will support you to\nthe hilt--you know that.\"\n\n\"Why, I ... I suppose so ... probably they would, yes.\"\n\n\"Do you know why?\"\n\n\"Can't say that I do, unless it's because I treat them fair, so they do\nthe same to me.\"\n\n\"Exactly. I don't say that everybody likes you, but I don't know of\nanybody who doesn't respect you. And, most important, everybody--all\nover space--knows 'Rod the Rock' Kinnison, and why he is called that.\"\n\n\"But that very 'man on horseback' thing may backfire on you, Virge.\"\n\n\"Perhaps--slightly--but we're not afraid of that. And finally, you said\nyou'd like to kick Morgan from here to Andromeda. How would you like to\nkick him from Panama City to the North Pole?\"\n\n\"I said it, and I wasn't just warming up my jets, either. I'd like it.\"\nThe big Lensman's nostrils flared, his lips thinned. \"By God, Virge, I\nwill!\"\n\n\"Thanks, Rod.\" With no display whatever of the emotion he felt, Samms\nskipped deliberately to the matter next in hand. \"Now, about Eridan.\nLet's see if they know anything yet.\"\n\nThe report of Knobos and DalNalten was terse and exact. They had\nfound--and that finding, so baldly put, could have filled and should\nfill a book--that Spaceways' uranium vessels were, beyond any\nreasonable doubt, hauling thionite from Eridan to the planets of\nSol. Spy-rays being useless, they had considered the advisability of\ninvestigating Eridan in person, but had decided against such action.\nEridan was closely held by Uranium, Incorporated. Its population was\none hundred percent Tellurian human. Neither DalNalten nor Knobos could\ndisguise himself well enough to work there. Either would be caught\npromptly, and as promptly shot.\n\n\"Thanks, fellows,\" Samms said, when it became evident that the brief\nreport was done. Then, to Kinnison, \"That puts it up to Conway\nCostigan. And Jack? Or Mase? Or both?\"\n\n\"Both,\" Kinnison decided, \"and anybody else they can use.\"\n\n\"I'll get them at it.\" Samms sent out thoughts. \"And now, I wonder what\nthat daughter of mine is doing? I'm a little worried about her, Rod.\nShe's too cocky for her own good--or strength. Some of these days she's\ngoing to bite off more than she can chew, if she hasn't already. The\nmore we learn about Morgan, the less I like the idea of her working on\nHerkimer Herkimer Third. I've told her so, a dozen times, and why, but\nof course it didn't do any good.\"\n\n\"It wouldn't. The only way to develop teeth is to bite with 'em. You\nhad to. So did I. Our kids have got to, too. We lived through it. So\nwill they. As for Herky the Third....\" He thought for moments, then\nwent on: \"Check. But she's done a job so far that nobody else could do.\nIn spite of that fact, if it wasn't for our Lenses I'd say to pull her,\nif you have to heave the insubordinate young jade into the brig. But\nwith the Lenses, and the way you watch her ... to say nothing of Mase\nNorthrop, and he's a lot of man ... I can't see her getting in either\nvery bad or very deep. Can you?\"\n\n\"No, I can't.\" Samms admitted, but the thoughtful frown did not leave\nhis face. He Lensed her: finding, as he had supposed, that she was at\na party; dancing, as he had feared, with Senator Morgan's Number One\nSecretary.\n\n\"Hi, Dad!\" she greeted him gaily, with no slightest change in the\nexpression of the face turned so engagingly to her partner's. \"I have\nthe honor of reporting that all instruments are still dead-centering\nthe green.\"\n\n\"And have you, by any chance, been paying any attention to what I have\nbeen telling you?\"\n\n\"Oh, lots,\" she assured him. \"I've collected reams of data. He could\nbe almost as much of a menace as he thinks he is, in some cases, but I\nhaven't begun to slip yet. As I have told you all along, this is just a\ngame, and we're both playing it strictly according to the rules.\"\n\n\"That's good. Keep it that way, my dear.\" Samms signed off and his\ndaughter returned her full attention--never noticeably absent--to the\nhandsome secretary.\n\nThe evening wore on. Miss Samms danced every dance; occasionally with\none or another of the notables present, but usually with Herkimer\nHerkimer Third.\n\n\"A drink?\" he asked. \"A small, cold one?\"\n\n\"Not so small, and _very_ cold,\" she agreed, enthusiastically.\n\nGlass in hand, Herkimer indicated a nearby doorway. \"I just heard that\nour host has acquired a very old and very fine bronze--a Neptune. We\nshould run an eye over it, don't you think?\"\n\n\"By all means,\" she agreed again.\n\nBut as they passed through the shadowed portal the man's head jerked\nto the right. \"_There's_ something you really ought to see, Jill!\" he\nexclaimed. \"Look!\"\n\nShe looked. A young woman of her own height and build and with her own\nflamboyant hair, identical as to hair-do and as to every fine detail of\ndress and of ornamentation, glass in hand, was strolling back into the\nball-room!\n\nJill started to protest, but could not. In the brief moment of inaction\nthe beam of a snub-nosed P-gun had played along her spine from hips to\nneck. She did not fall--he had given her a very mild jolt--but, rage as\nshe would, she could neither struggle nor scream. And, after the fact,\nshe knew.\n\nBut he _couldn't_--couldn't _possibly_! Nevian paralysis-guns were as\noutlawed as was Vee Two gas itself! Nevertheless, he had.\n\nAnd on the instant a woman, dressed in crisp and spotless white and\ncarrying a hooded cloak, appeared--and Herkimer now wore a beard and\nheavy, horn rimmed spectacles. Thus, very shortly, Virgilia Samms\nfound herself, completely helpless and completely unrecognizable,\nwalking awkwardly out of the house between a businesslike doctor and a\nsolicitous nurse.\n\n\"Will you need me any more, Doctor Murray?\" The woman carefully and\nexpertly loaded the patient into the rear seat of a car.\n\n\"Thank you, no, Miss Childs.\" With a sick, cold certainty Jill knew\nthat this conversation was for the benefit of the doorman and the\nhackers, and that it would stand up under any examination. \"Mrs.\nHarman's condition is ... er ... well, nothing at all serious.\"\n\nThe car moved out into the street and Jill, really frightened for the\nfirst time in her triumphant life, fought down an almost overwhelming\nwave of panic. The hood had slipped down over her eyes, blinding her.\nShe could not move a single voluntary muscle. Nevertheless, she knew\nthat the car traveled a few blocks--six, she thought--west on Bolton\nStreet before turning left.\n\nWhy didn't somebody Lens her? Her father wouldn't, she knew, until\ntomorrow. Neither of the Kinnisons would, nor Spud--they never did\nexcept on direct invitation. But Mase would, before he went to bed--or\nwould he? It was past his bed-time now, and she had been pretty\ncaustic, only last night, because she was doing a particularly delicate\nbit of reading. But he would ... he _must_!\n\n\"Mase! _Mase!_ MASE!\"\n\nAnd, eventually, Mase did.\n\nDeep under The Hill, Roderick Kinnison swore fulminantly at the sheer\nphysical impossibility of getting out of that furiously radiating\nmountain in a hurry. At New York Spaceport, however, Mason Northrop and\nJack Kinnison not only could hurry, but did.\n\n\"Where are you, Jill?\" Northrop demanded presently. \"What kind of a car\nare you in?\"\n\n\"Quite near Stanhope Circle.\" In communication with her friends at\nlast, Jill regained a measure of her usual poise. \"Within eight or ten\nblocks, I'm sure. I'm in a black Wilford sedan, last year's model. I\ndidn't get a chance to see its license plates.\"\n\n\"That helps a lot!\" Jack grunted, savagely. \"A ten-block radius covers\na hell of a lot of territory, and half the cars in town are black\nWilford sedans.\"\n\n\"Shut up, Jack! Go ahead, Jill--tell us all you can, and keep on\nsending us anything that will help at all.\"\n\n\"I kept the right and left turns and distances straight for quite a\nwhile--about twenty blocks--that's how I know it was Stanhope Circle. I\ndon't know how many times he went around the circle, though, or which\nway he went when he left it. After leaving the Circle, the traffic was\nvery light, and here there doesn't seem to be any traffic at all. That\nbrings us up to date. You'll know as well as I do what happens next.\"\n\nWith Jill, the Lensmen knew that Herkimer drove his car up to the\ncurb and stopped--parked without backing up. He got out and hauled\nthe girl's limp body out of the car, displacing the hood enough to\nfree one eye. Good! Only one other car was visible; a bright yellow\nconvertible parked across the street, about half a block ahead. There\nwas a sign--\"NO PARKING ON THIS SIDE 7 TO 10.\" The building toward\nwhich he was carrying her was more than three stories high, and had a\nnumber--one, four--if he would _only_ swing her a little bit more, so\nthat she could see the rest of it--one four-seven-nine!\n\n\"Rushton Boulevard, you think, Mase?\"\n\n\"Could be. Fourteen seventy nine would be on the downtown-traffic side.\nBlast!\"\n\nInto the building, where two masked men locked and barred the door\nbehind them. \"And keep it locked!\" Herkimer ordered. \"You know what to\ndo until I come back down.\"\n\nInto an elevator, and up. Through massive double doors into a room,\nwhose most conspicuous item of furniture was a heavy steel chair,\nbolted to the floor. Two masked men got up and placed themselves behind\nthat chair.\n\nJill's strength was coming back fast; but not fast enough. The cloak\nwas removed. Her ankles were tied firmly, one to each front leg of\nthe chair. Herkimer threw four turns of rope around her torso and the\nchair's back, took up every inch of slack, and tied a workmanlike knot.\nThen, still without a word, he stood back and lighted a cigarette. The\nlast trace of paralysis disappeared, but the girl's mad struggles,\nfutile as they were, were not allowed to continue.\n\n\"Put a double hammerlock on her,\" Herkimer directed, \"but be damned\nsure not to break anything at this stage of the game. That comes later.\"\n\nJill, more furiously angry than frightened until now, locked her teeth\nto keep from screaming as the pressure went on. She could not bend\nforward to relieve the pain; she could not move; she could only grit\nher teeth and glare. She was beginning to realize, however, what was\nactually in store; that Herkimer Herkimer Third was in fact a monster\nwhose like she had never known.\n\nHe stepped quietly forward, gathered up a handful of fabric, and\nheaved. The strapless and backless garment, in no way designed to\nwithstand such stresses, parted; squarely across at the upper strand\nof rope. He puffed his cigarette to a vivid coal--took it in his\nfingers--there was an audible hiss and a tiny stink of burning flesh as\nthe glowing ember was extinguished in the clear, clean skin below the\ngirl's left armpit. Jill flinched then, and shrieked desperately, but\nher tormentor was viciously unmoved.\n\n\"That was just to settle any doubt as to whether or not I mean\nbusiness. I'm all done fooling around with you. I want to know two\nthings. First, everything you know about the Lens; where it comes from,\nwhat it really is, and what it does besides what your press-agents\nadvertise. Second, what really happened at the Ambassadors' Ball. Start\ntalking. The faster you talk, the less you'll get hurt.\"\n\n\"You can't get away with this, Herkimer.\" Jill tried desperately to\npull her shattered nerves together. \"I'll be missed--traced....\" She\npaused, gasping. If she told him that the Lensmen were in full and\ncontinuous communication with her--and if he believed it--he would kill\nher right then. She switched instantly to another track. \"That double\nisn't good enough to fool anybody who really knows me.\"\n\n\"She doesn't have to be.\" The man grinned venomously. \"Nobody who knows\nyou will get close enough to her to tell the difference. This wasn't\ndone on the spur of the moment, Jill; it was planned--minutely. You\nhaven't got the chance of the proverbial celluloid dog in hell.\"\n\n\"Jill!\" Jack Kinnison's thought stabbed in. \"It isn't\nRushton--fourteen seventy-nine is a two-story. What other streets could\nit be?\"\n\n\"I don't know....\" She was not in very good shape to think.\n\n\"Damnation! Got to get hold of somebody who knows the streets. Spud,\ngrab a hacker at the Circle and I'll Lens Parker....\" Jack's thought\nsnapped off as he tuned to a local Lensman.\n\nJill's heart sank. She was starkly certain now that the Lensmen could\nnot find her in time.\n\n\"Tighten up a little, Eddie. You, too, Bob.\"\n\n\"Stop it! Oh, God, STOP IT!\" The unbearable agony relaxed a little. She\nwatched in horrified fascination a second glowing coal approach her\nbare right side. \"Even if I do talk you'll kill me anyway. You couldn't\nlet me go now.\"\n\n\"Kill you, my pet? Not if you behave yourself. We've got a lot of\nplanets the Patrol never heard of, and you could keep a man interested\nfor quite a while, if you really tried. And if you beg hard enough\nmaybe I'll let you try. However, I'd get just as much fun out of\nkilling you as out of the other, so it's up to you. Not sudden death,\nof course. Little things, at first, like we've been doing. A few more\ntouches of warmth here and there--so....\n\n\"Scream as much as you please. I enjoy it, and this room is\nsound-proof. Once more, boys, about half an inch higher this\ntime ... up ... steady ... down. We'll have half an hour or so\nof this stuff\"--Herkimer knew that to the quivering, sensitive,\nhighly imaginative girl his words would be practically as punishing\nas the atrocious actualities themselves--\"then I'll do things to\nyour finger-nails and toe-nails, beginning with burning slivers of\ndouble-base flare powder and working up. Then your eyes--or no,\nI'll save them until last, so you can watch a couple of Venerian\nslasher-worms work on you, one on each leg, and a Martian digger on\nyour bare belly.\"\n\nGripping her hair firmly in his left hand, he forced her head back and\ndown; down almost to her hard-held hands. His right hand, concealing\nsomething which he had not mentioned and which was probably starkly\nunmentionable, approached her taut-stretched throat.\n\n\"Talk or not, just as you please.\" The voice was utterly callous, as\nchill as the death she now knew he was so willing to deal. \"But listen.\nIf you elect to talk, tell the truth. You won't lie twice. I'll count\nto ten. One.\"\n\nJill uttered a gurgling, strangling noise and he lifted her head a\ntrifle.\n\n\"Can you talk now?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Two.\"\n\nHelpless, immobile, scared now to a depth of terror she had never\nimagined it possible to feel, Jill fought her wrenched and shaken mind\nback from insanity's very edge; managed with a pale tongue to lick\nbloodless lips. Pops Kinnison always said a man could die only once,\nbut he didn't know ... in battle, yes, perhaps ... but she had already\ndied a dozen times--but she'd keep on dying forever before she'd say a\nword. But--\n\n\"Tell him, Jill!\" Northrop's thought beat at her mind. He, her lover,\nwas unashamedly frantic; as much with sheer rage as with sympathy for\nher physical and mental anguish. \"For the nineteenth time I say _tell\nhim_! We've just located you--Hancock Avenue--we'll be there in two\nminutes!\"\n\n\"Yes, Jill, quit being a damned stubborn jackass and _tell him_!\" Jack\nKinnison's thought bit deep; but this time, strangely enough, the\ngirl felt no repugnance at his touch. There was nothing whatever of\nthe lover; nor of the brother, except of the fraternity of arms. She\nbelonged. She would come out of this brawl right side up or none of\nthem would. \"Tell the goddam rat the truth!\" Jack's thought drove on.\n\"It won't make any difference--he won't live long enough to pass it on!\"\n\n\"But I can't--I won't!\" Jill stormed. \"Why, Pops Kinnison would....\"\n\n\"Not this time I wouldn't, Jill!\" Samms' thought tried to come in, too,\nbut the Port Admiral's vehemence was overwhelming. \"No harm--he's doing\nthis strictly on his own--if Morgan had had any idea he'd've killed him\nfirst. Start talking or I'll spank you to a rosy blister!\"\n\nThey were to laugh, later, at the incongruity of that threat, but it\ndid produce results.\n\n\"Nine.\" Herkimer grinned wolfishly, in sadistic anticipation.\n\n\"Stop it--I'll tell!\" she screamed. \"Stop it--take that thing away--I\ncan't _stand_ it--I'll tell!\" She burst into racking, tearing sobs.\n\n\"Steady.\" Herkimer put something in his pocket, then slapped her so\nviciously that fingers-long marks sprang into red relief upon the\nchalk-white background of her cheek. \"Don't crack up; I haven't started\nto work on you yet. What about that Lens?\"\n\nShe gulped twice before she could speak. \"It comes from--ulp!--Arisia.\nI haven't got one myself, so I don't know very much--ulp!--about it at\nfirst hand, but from what the boys tell me it must be....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOutside the building three black forms arrowed downward. Northrop and\nyoung Kinnison stopped at the sixth level; Costigan went on down to\ntake care of the guards.\n\n\"Bullets, not beams,\" the Irishman reminded his younger fellows. \"We'll\nhave to clean up the mess without leaving a trace, so don't do any more\ndamage to the property than you absolutely have to.\"\n\nNeither made any reply; they were both too busy. The two thugs standing\nbehind the steel chair, being armed openly, went first; then Jack put a\nbullet through Herkimer's head. But Northrop was not content with that.\nHe slid the pin to \"full automatic\" and ten more heavy slugs tore into\nthe falling body before it struck the floor.\n\nThree quick slashes and the girl was free.\n\n\"Jill!\"\n\n\"Mase!\"\n\nLocked in each other's arms, straining together, no bystander would\nhave believed that this was their first kiss. It was plainly--yes,\nquite spectacularly--evident, however, that it would not be their last.\n\nJack, blushing furiously, picked up the cloak and flung it at the\noblivious couple.\n\n\"P-s-s-t! _P-s-s-t! Jill!_ Wrap 'em up!\" he whispered, urgently. \"All\nthe top brass in space is coming at full emergency blast--there'll\nbe scrambled eggs all over the place any second now--_Mase!_ _Damn_\nyour thick, hard skull, snap out of it! He's always frothing at the\nmouth about her running around half naked and if he sees her like\nthis--especially with _you_--he'll simply have a litter of lizards!\nYou'll get a million black spots and seven hundred years in the clink!\nThat's better--'bye now--I'll see you up at New York Spaceport.\"\n\nJack Kinnison dashed to the nearest window, threw it open, and dived\nheadlong out of the building.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14\n\n\nThe employment office of any concern with personnel running into the\nhundreds of thousands is a busy place indeed, even when its plants are\nall on Tellus and its working conditions are as nearly ideal as such\nthings can be made. When that firm's business is Colonial, however,\nand its working conditions are only a couple of degrees removed from\nslavery, procurement of personnel is a first-magnitude problem; the\nPersonnel Department, like Alice in Wonderland, must run as fast\nas it can go in order to stay where it is. Thus the \"Help Wanted\"\nadvertisements of Uranium, Incorporated covered the planet Earth with\nblandishment and guile; and thus for twelve hours of every day and for\nseven days of every week the employment offices of Uranium, Inc. were\nfilled with men--mostly the scum of Earth.\n\nThere were, of course, exceptions; one of which strode through the\nmotley group of waiting men and thrust a card through the \"Information\"\nwicket. He was a chunky-looking individual, appearing shorter than\nhis actual five feet nine because of a hundred and ninety pounds of\nweight--even though every pound was placed exactly where it would do\nthe most good. He looked--well, slouchy--and his mien was sullen.\n\n\"Birkenfeld--by appointment,\" he growled through the wicket, in a voice\nwhich could have been pleasantly deep.\n\nThe coolly efficient blonde manipulated plugs. \"Mr. George W. Jones,\nsir, by appointment.... Thank you, sir,\" and Mr. Jones was escorted\ninto Mr. Birkenfeld's private office.\n\n\"Have a chair, please, Mr. ... er ... Jones.\"\n\n\"So you know?\"\n\n\"Yes. It is seldom that a man of your education, training, and\ndemonstrated ability applies to us for employment of his own\ninitiative, and a very thorough investigation is indicated.\"\n\n\"What am I here for, then?\" the visitor demanded, truculently. \"You\ncould have turned me down by mail. Everybody else has, since I got out.\"\n\n\"You are here because we who operate on the frontiers cannot afford\nto pass judgment upon a man because of his past, unless that past\nprecludes the probability of a useful future. Yours does not; and\nin some cases, such as yours, we are very deeply interested in the\nfuture.\" The official's eyes drilled deep.\n\nConway Costigan had never been in the limelight. On the contrary, he\nhad made inconspicuousness a passion and an art. Even in such scenes of\nviolence as that which had occurred at the Ambassadors' Ball he managed\nto remain unnoticed. His Lens had never been visible. No one except\nLensmen--and Clio and Jill--knew that he had one; and Lensmen--and\nClio and Jill--did not talk. Although he was calmly certain that this\nBirkenfeld was not an ordinary interviewer, he was equally certain that\nthe investigators of Uranium, Inc. had found out exactly and only what\nthe Patrol had wanted them to find.\n\n\"So?\" Jones' bearing altered subtly, and not because of the penetrant\neyes. \"That's all I want--a chance. I'll start at the bottom, as far\ndown as you say.\"\n\n\"We advertise, and truthfully, that opportunity on Eridan is\nunlimited.\" Birkenfeld chose his words with care. \"In your case,\nopportunity will be either absolutely unlimited or zero, depending\nentirely upon yourself.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Dumbness had not been included in the fictitious Mr. Jones'\nbackground. \"You don't need to draw a blue-print.\"\n\n\"You'll do, I think.\" The interviewer nodded in approval.\n\"Nevertheless, I must make our position entirely clear. If the slip\nwas--shall we say accidental?--you will go far with us. If you try to\nplay false, you will not last long and you will not be missed.\"\n\n\"Fair enough.\"\n\n\"Your willingness to start at the bottom is commendable, and it is a\nfact that those who come up through the ranks make the best executives;\nin our line at least. Just how far down are you willing to start?\"\n\n\"How low do you go?\"\n\n\"A mucker, I think would be low enough; and, from your build, and\nobvious physical strength, the logical job.\"\n\n\"Mucker?\"\n\n\"One who skoufers ore in the mine. Nor can we make any exception in\nyour case as to the routines of induction and transportation.\"\n\n\"Of course not.\"\n\n\"Take this slip to Mr. Calkins, in Room 6217. He will run you through\nthe mill.\"\n\nAnd that night, in an obscure boarding-house, Mr. George Washington\nJones, after a meticulous Service Special survey in every direction,\nreached a large and somewhat grimy hand into a screened receptacle in\nhis battered suitcase and touched a Lens.\n\n\"Clio?\" The lovely mother of their wonderful children appeared in his\nmind. \"Made it, sweetheart, no suspicion at all. No more Lensing for a\nwhile--not too long, I hope--so ... so-long, Clio.\"\n\n\"Take it easy, Spud darling, and _be careful_.\" Her tone was light, but\nshe could not conceal a stark background of fear. \"Oh, I _wish_ I could\ngo, too!\"\n\n\"I wish you could, Tootie.\" The linked minds flashed back to what the\ntwo had done together in the red opacity of Nevian murk; on Nevia's\nmighty, watery globe--but that kind of thinking would not do. \"But the\nboys will keep in touch with me and keep you posted. And besides, you\nknow how hard it is to get a baby-sitter!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt is strange that the fundamental operations of working metalliferous\nveins have changed so little throughout the ages. Or is it? Ores came\ninto being with the crusts of the planets; they change appreciably only\nwith the passage of geologic time. Ancient mines, of course, could\nnot go down very deep or follow a seam very far; there was too much\nwater and too little air. The steam engine helped, in degree if not in\nkind, by removing water and supplying air. Tools improved--from the\nsimple metal bar through pick and shovel and candle, through drill and\nhammer and low explosive and acetylene, through Sullivan slugger and\nhigh explosive and electrics, through skoufer and rotary and burley\nand sourceless glow, to the complex gadgetry of today--but what,\nfundamentally, is the difference? Men still crawl, snake-like, to where\nthe metal is. Men still, by dint of sheer brawn, jackass the precious\nstuff out to where our vaunted automatics can get hold of it. And men\nstill die, in horribly unknown fashions and in callously recorded\nnumbers, in the mines which supply the stuff upon which our vaunted\nculture rests.\n\nBut to resume the thread of narrative, George Washington Jones went\nto Eridan as a common laborer; a mucker. He floated down beside the\nskip--a \"skip\" is a mine elevator--some four thousand eight hundred\nfeet. He rode an ore-car a horizontal distance of approximately eight\nmiles to the brilliantly-illuminated cavern which was the Station of\nthe Twelfth and lowest level. He was assigned to the bunk in which he\nwould sleep for the next fifteen nights: \"Fifteen down and three up,\"\nran the standard underground contract.\n\nHe walked four hundred yards, yelled \"Nothing Down!\" and inched his\nway up a rise--in many places scarcely wider than his shoulders--to\nthe stope some three hundred feet above. He reported to the miner who\nwas to be his immediate boss and bent his back to the skoufer--which,\nwhile not resembling a shovel at all closely, still meant hard physical\nlabor. He already knew ore--the glossy, sub-metallic, pitchy black\nluster of uraninite or pitchblende; the yellows of autunite and\ncarnotite; the variant and confusing greens of tobernite. No values\nwent from Jones' skoufer into the heavily-timbered, steel-braced\nwaste-pockets of the stope; very little base rock went down the rise.\n\nHe became accustomed to the work; got used to breathing the peculiarly\nlifeless, dry, oily compressed air. And when, after a few days, his\nstentorian \"Nothing Down!\" called forth a \"Nothing but a little\nfine stuff!\" and a handful of grit and pebbles, he knew that he had\nbeen accepted into the undefined, unwritten, and unofficial, yet\nnevertheless intensely actual, fellowship of hard-rock men. He belonged.\n\nHe knew that he must abandon his policy of invisibility; and, after\nseveral days of thought, he decided how he would do it. Hence, upon the\nfirst day of his \"up\" period, he joined his fellows in their descent\nupon one of the rawest, noisiest dives of Danapolis. The men were met,\nof course, by a bevy of giggling, shrieking, garishly painted and\nstrongly perfumed girls--and at this point young Jones' behavior became\nexceedingly unorthodox.\n\n\"Buy me a drink, mister? And a dance, huh?\"\n\n\"On your way, sister.\" He brushed the importunate wench aside. \"I get\nenough exercise underground, an' you ain't got a thing I want.\"\n\nApparently unaware that the girl was exchanging meaningful glances with\na couple of husky characters labelled \"BOUNCER\" in billposter type,\nthe atypical mucker strode up to the long and ornate bar.\n\n\"Gimme a bottle of pineapple pop,\" he ordered bruskly, \"an' a package\nof Tellurian cigarettes--Sunshines.\"\n\n\"P-p-pine...?\" The surprised bartender did not finish the word.\n\nThe bouncers were fast, but Costigan was faster. A hard knee took one\nin the solar plexus; a hard elbow took the other so savagely under\nthe chin as to all but break his neck. A bartender started to swing a\nbung-starter, and found himself flying through the air toward a table.\nMen, table, and drinks crashed to the floor.\n\n\"I pick my own company an' I drink what I damn please,\" Jones\nannounced, grittily. \"Them lunkers ain't hurt none, to speak of ...\"\nHis hard eyes swept the room malevolently, \"but I ain't in no gentle\nmood an' the next jaspers that tackle me will wind up in the repair\nshop, or maybe in the morgue. See?\"\n\nThis of course was much too much; a dozen embattled roughnecks leaped\nto mop up on the misguided wight who had so impugned the manhood of all\nEridan. Then, while six or seven bartenders blew frantic blasts upon\npolice whistles, there was a flurry of action too fast to be resolved\ninto consecutive events by the eye. Conway Costigan, one of the fastest\nmen with hands and feet the Patrol has ever known, was trying to keep\nhimself alive; and he succeeded.\n\n\"What the hell goes on here?\" a chorus of raucously authoritative\nvoices yelled, and sixteen policemen--John Law did not travel singly in\nthat district, but in platoons--swinging clubs and saps, finally hauled\nGeorge Washington Jones out from the bottom of the pile. He had sundry\nabrasions and not a few contusions, but no bones were broken and his\nskin was practically whole.\n\nAnd since his version of the affair was not only inadequate, but\nalso differed in important particulars from those of several\nnon-participating witnesses, he spent the rest of his holiday in jail;\na development with which he was quite content.\n\nThe work--and time--went on. He became in rapid succession a head\nmucker, a miner's pimp (which short and rugged Anglo-Saxon word means\nsimply \"helper\" in underground parlance) a miner, a top-miner, and\nthen--a long step up the ladder!--a shift-boss.\n\nAnd then disaster struck; suddenly, paralyzingly, as mine disasters do.\nLoud-speakers blared briefly--\"Explosion! Cave-in! Flood! Fire! Gas!\nRadiation! Damp!\"--and expired. Short-circuits; there was no way of\ntelling which, if any, of those dire warnings were true.\n\nThe power failed, and the lights. The hiss of air from valves, a noise\nwhich by its constant and unvarying and universal presence soon becomes\nunheard, became noticeable because of its diminution in volume and\ntone. And then, seconds later, a jarring, shuddering rumble was felt\nand heard, accompanied by the snapping of shattered timbers and the\nsharper, utterly unforgettable shriek of rending and riven steel. And\nthe men, as men do under such conditions, went wild; yelling, swearing,\nleaping toward where, in the rayless dark, each thought the rise to be.\n\nIt took a couple of seconds for the shift-boss to break out and\nhook up his emergency battery-lamp; and three or four more seconds,\nand by dint of fists, feet, and a two-foot length of air-hose, to\nrestore any degree of order. Four men were dead; but that wasn't too\nbad--considering.\n\n\"Up there! Under the hanging wall!\" he ordered, sharply. \"_That_ won't\nfall--unless the whole mountain slips. Now, how many of you jaspers\nhave got your emergency kits on you? Twelve--out of twenty-six--what\nbrains! Put on your masks. You without 'em can stay up here--you'll be\nsafe for a while--I hope.\"\n\nThen, presently: \"There, that's all for now. I guess.\" He flashed\nhis light downward. The massive steel members no longer writhed; the\ncrushed and tortured timbers were still.\n\n\"That rise may be open, it goes through solid rock, not waste. I'll\nsee. Wright, you're all in one piece, aren't you?\"\n\n\"I guess so--yes.\"\n\n\"Take charge up here. I'll go down to the drift. If the rise is open\nI'll give you a flash. Send the ones with masks down, one at a time.\nTake a jolly-bar and bash the brains out of anybody who gets panicky\nagain.\"\n\nJones was not as brave as he sounded: mine disasters carry a terror\nwhich is uniquely and peculiarly poignant. Nevertheless he went down\nthe rise, found it open, and signalled. Then, after issuing brief\norders, he led the way along the dark and silent drift toward the\nStation; wondering profanely why the people on duty there had not done\nsomething with the wealth of emergency equipment always ready there.\nThe party found some cave-ins, but nothing they could not dig through.\n\nThe Station was also silent and dark. Jones, flashing his head-lamp\nupon the emergency panel, smashed the glass, wrenched the door open,\nand pushed buttons. Lights flashed on. Warning signals flared, bellowed\nand rang. The rotary air-pump began again its normal subdued,\nwhickering whirr. But the water-pump! Shuddering, clanking, groaning,\nit was threatening to go out any second--but there wasn't a thing in\nthe world Jones could do about it--yet.\n\nThe Station itself, so buttressed and pillared with alloy steel as\nto be little more compressible than an equal volume of solid rock,\nwas unharmed; but in it nothing lived. Four men and a woman--the\nnurse--were stiffly motionless at their posts; apparently the leads to\nthe Station had been blasted in such fashion that no warning whatever\nhad been given. And smoke, billowing inward from the main tunnel,\nwas growing thicker by the minute. Jones punched another button; a\nfoot-thick barrier of asbestos, tungsten, and vitrified refractory slid\nsmoothly across the tunnel's opening. He considered briefly, pityingly,\nthose who might be outside, but felt no urge to explore. If any lived,\nthere were buttons on the other side of the fire-door.\n\nThe eddying smoke disappeared, the flaring lights winked out, air-horns\nand bells relapsed into silence. The shift-boss, now apparently the\nSuperintendent of the whole Twelfth Level, removed his mask, found the\nStation walkie-talkie, and snapped a switch. He spoke, listened, spoke\nagain then called a list of names--none of which brought any response.\n\n\"Wright, and you five others,\" picking out miners who could be depended\nupon to keep their heads, \"take these guns. Shoot if you have to, but\nnot unless you have to. Have the muckers clear the drift, just enough\nto get through. You'll find a shift-boss, with a crew of nineteen, up\nin Stope Sixty. Their rise is blocked. They've got light and power\nagain now, and good air, and they're working on it, but opening the\nrise from the top is a damned slow job. Wright, you throw a chippie\ninto it from the bottom. You others, work back along the drift, clear\nto the last glory hole. Be sure that all the rises are open--check all\nthe stopes and glory holes--tell everybody you find alive to report to\nme here....\"\n\n\"Aw, what good!\" a man shrieked. \"We're all goners anyway--I want\n_water_ an'....\"\n\n\"Shut up, fool!\" There was a sound as of fist meeting flesh, the shriek\nwas stilled. \"Plenty of water--tanks full of the stuff.\" A grizzled\nminer turned to the self-appointed boss and twitched his head--toward\nthe laboring pump. \"Too damn much water too soon, huh?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't wonder--but get busy!\"\n\nAs his now orderly and purposeful men disappeared, Jones picked up his\nmicrophone and changed the setting of a dial.\n\n\"On top, somebody,\" he said crisply. \"On top....\"\n\n\"Oh, there's somebody alive down in Twelve, after all!\" a girl's voice\nscreamed in his ear. \"Mr. Clancy! Mr. Edwards!\"\n\n\"To hell with Clancy, and Edwards, too,\" Jones barked. \"Gimme the Chief\nEngineer and the Head Surveyor, and gimme 'em _fast_.\"\n\n\"Clancy speaking, Station Twelve.\" If Works Manager Clancy had heard\nthat pointed remark, and he must have, he ignored it. \"Stanley and\nEmerson will be here in a moment. In the meantime, who's calling? I\ndon't recognize your voice, and it's been so long....\"\n\n\"Jones. Shift-boss, Stope Fifty Nine. I had a little trouble getting\nhere to the Station.\"\n\n\"What? Where's Pennoyer? And Riley? And...?\"\n\n\"Dead. Everybody. Gas or damp. No warning.\"\n\n\"Not enough to turn on _anything_--not even the purifiers?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Where were you?\"\n\n\"Up in the stope.\"\n\n\"Good God!\" That news, to Clancy, was informative enough.\n\n\"But to hell with all that. What happened, and where?\"\n\n\"A skip-load, and then a magazine, of high explosive, right at Station\nSeven--it's right at the main shaft, you know.\" Jones did not know,\nsince he had never been in that part of the mine, but he could see\nthe picture. \"Main shaft filled up to above Seven, and both emergency\nshafts blocked. Number One at Six, Number Two at Seven--must have been\na fault--But here's Chief Engineer Stanley.\" The works manager, not too\nunwillingly, relinquished the microphone.\n\nA miner came running up and Jones covered his mouth-piece. \"How about\nthe glory holes?\"\n\n\"Plugged solid, all four of 'em--by the vibro, clear up to Eleven.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\" Then, as soon as Stanley's voice came on:\n\n\"What I want to know is, why is this damned water-pump overloading?\nWhat's the circuit?\"\n\n\"You must be ... yes, you are pumping against too much head. Five\nlevels above you are dead, you know, so....\"\n\n\"Dead? Can't you raise _anybody_?\"\n\n\"Not yet. So you're pumping through dead boosters on Eleven and Ten and\nso on up, and when your overload-relief valve opens....\"\n\n\"_Relief_ valve!\" Jones almost screamed, \"Can I dog the damn thing\ndown?\"\n\n\"No, it's internal.\"\n\n\"Christ, what a design--I could eat a handful of iron filings and\n_puke_ a better emergency pump than that!\"\n\n\"When it opens,\" Stanley went stolidly on, \"the water will go through\nthe by-pass back into the sump. So you'd better rod out one of the\nglory holes and....\"\n\n\"Get conscious, fat-head!\" Jones blazed. \"What would we use for time?\nGet off the air--gimme Emerson!\"\n\n\"Emerson speaking.\"\n\n\"Got your maps?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"We got to run a sag up to Eleven--fast--or drown. Can you give me the\nshortest possible distance?\"\n\n\"Can do.\" The Head Surveyor snapped orders. \"We'll have it for you in a\nminute. Thank God there was somebody down there with a brain.\"\n\n\"It doesn't take super-human intelligence to push buttons.\"\n\n\"You'd be surprised. Your point on glory holes was very well taken--you\nwon't have much time after the pump quits. When the water reaches the\nStation....\"\n\n\"Curtains. And it's all done now--running free and easy--recirculating.\nHurry that dope!\"\n\n\"Here it is now. Start at the highest point of Stope Fifty Nine.\nRepeat.\"\n\n\"Stope Fifty-Nine.\" Jones waved a furious hand as he shouted the\nwords; the tight-packed miners turned and ran. The shift-boss followed\nthem, carrying the walkie-talkie, aiming an exasperated kick of pure\nfrustration at the merrily-humming water pump as he passed it.\n\n\"Thirty two degrees from the vertical--anywhere between thirty and\nthirty five.\"\n\n\"Thirty to thirty five off vertical.\"\n\n\"Direction--got a compass?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Set the blue on zero. Course two hundred seventy five degrees.\"\n\n\"Blue on zero. Course two seven five.\"\n\n\"Dex sixty nine point two zero feet. That'll put you into Eleven's\nclass yard--so big you can't miss it.\"\n\n\"Distance sixty nine point two--_that_ all? Fine! Maybe we'll make it,\nafter all. They're sinking a shaft, of course. From where?\"\n\n\"About four miles in on Six. It'll take time.\"\n\n\"If we can get up into Eleven we'll have all the time on the\nclock--it'll take a week or more to flood Twelve's stopes. But this sag\nis sure as hell going to be touch and go. And say, from the throw of\nthe pump and the volume of the sump, will you give me the best estimate\nyou can of how much time we've got? I want at least an hour, but I'm\nafraid I won't have it.\"\n\n\"Yes. I'll call you back.\"\n\nThe shift-boss elbowed his way through the throng of men and, dragging\nthe radio behind him, wriggled and floated up the rise.\n\n\"Wright!\" he bellowed, the echoes resounding deafeningly all up and\ndown the narrow tube. \"You up there ahead of me?\"\n\n\"Yeah!\" that worthy bellowed back.\n\n\"More men left than I thought--how many--half of 'em?\"\n\n\"Just about.\"\n\n\"Good. Sort out the ones you got up there by trades.\" Then, when he\nhad emerged into the now brilliantly illuminated stope, \"Where are the\ntimber-pimps?\"\n\n\"Over there.\"\n\n\"Rustle timbers. Whatever you can find and wherever you find it, grab\nit and bring it up here. Get some twelve-inch steel, too, six feet\nlong. Timbermen, grab that stuff off of the face and start your staging\nright here. You muckers, rig a couple of skoufers to throw muck to bury\nthe base and checkerwork up to the hanging wall. Doze a sluice-way down\ninto that waste pocket there, so we won't clog ourselves up. Work fast,\nfellows, but make it _solid_--you know the load it'll have to carry and\nwhat will happen if it gives.\"\n\nThey knew. They knew what they had to do and did it; furiously, but\nwith care and precision.\n\n\"How wide a sag you figurin' on, Supe?\" the boss timberman asked.\n\"Eight foot checkerwork to the hangin', anyway, huh?\"\n\n\"Yes. I'll let you know in a minute.\"\n\nThe surveyor came in. \"Forty one minutes is my best guess.\"\n\n\"From when?\"\n\n\"From the time the pump failed.\"\n\n\"That was four minutes ago--nearer five. And five more before we can\nstart cutting. Forty one less ten is thirty one. Thirty one into sixty\nnine point two goes....\"\n\n\"Two point two three feet per minute, my slip-stick says.\"\n\n\"Thanks. Wright, what would you say is the biggest sag we can cut in\nthis kind of rock at two and a quarter feet a minute?\"\n\n\"Um ... m ... m\". The miner scratched his whiskery chin. \"That's a\ntough one, boss. You'll hafta figure damn close to a hundred pounds of\nair to the foot on plain cuttin'--that's two hundred and a quarter.\nBut without a burley to pimp for 'er, a rotary can't take that kind of\nair--she'll foul herself to a standstill before she cuts a foot. An'\nwith a burley riggin' she's got to make damn near a double cut--seven\nfoot inside figger--so any way you look at it you ain't goin' to cut no\ntwo foot to the minute.\"\n\n\"I was hoping you wouldn't check my figures, but you do. So we'll cut\nfive feet. Saw your timbers accordingly. We'll hold that burley by\nhand.\"\n\nWright shook his head dubiously. \"We don't want to die down here any\nmore than you do, boss, so we'll do our damndest--but how in _hell_ do\nyou figure you can hold her to her work?\"\n\n\"Rig a yoke. Cut a stretcher up for canvas and padding. It'll pound,\nbut a man can stand almost anything, in short enough shifts, if he's\ngot to or die.\"\n\nAnd for a time--two minutes, to be exact, during which the rotary\nchewed up and spat out a plug of rock over five feet deep--things went\nvery well indeed. Two men, instead of the usual three, could run the\nrotary; that is, they could tend the complicated pneumatic walking\njacks which not only oscillated the cutting demon in a geometrical\npath, but also rammed it against the face with a steadily held and\nenormous pressure, even while climbing almost vertically upward under a\nburden of over twenty thousand pounds.\n\nAn armored hand waved a signal--voice was utterly useless--up! A\nvalve was flipped; a huge, flat, steel foot arose; a timber slid into\nplace, creaking and groaning as that big flat foot smashed down.\nUp--again! Up--a third time! Eighteen seconds--less than one-third of a\nminute--ten inches gained!\n\nAnd, while it was not easy, two men could hold the burley--in\none-minute shifts. As has been intimated, this machine \"pimped\" for\nthe rotary. It waited on it, ministering to its every need with a\nsingleness of purpose impossible to any except robotic devotion. It\npicked the rotary's teeth, it freed its linkages, it deloused its\nports, it cleared its spillways of compacted debris, it even--and this\nis a feat starkly unbelievable to anyone who does not know the hardness\nof neocarballoy and the tensile strength of ultra-special steels--it\neven changed, while in full operation, the rotary's diamond-tipped\ncutters.\n\nBoth burley and rotary were extremely efficient, but neither was either\nquiet or gentle. In their quietest moments they shrieked and groaned\nand yelled, producing a volume of sound in which nothing softer than a\ncannon-shot could have been heard. But when, in changing the rotary's\ncutting teeth, the burley's \"fingers\" were driven into and through the\nsolid rock--a matter of merest routine to both machines--the resultant\nblasts of sound cannot even be imagined, to say nothing of being\ndescribed.\n\nAnd always both machines spewed out torrents of rock, in sizes ranging\nfrom impalpable dust up to chunks as big as a fist.\n\nAs the sag lengthened and the checkerwork grew higher, the work began\nto slow down. They began to lose the time they had gained. There were\nplenty of men, but in that narrow bore there simply was not room for\nenough men to work. Even through that storm of dust and hurtling rock\nthe timbermen could get their blocking up there, but they could not\nplace it fast enough--there were too many other men in the way. One of\nthem had to get out. Since one man could not _possibly_ run the rotary,\none man would have to hold the burley.\n\nThey tried it, one after another. No soap. It hammered them flat. The\nrotary, fouled in every tooth and channel and vent under the terrific\nthrust of two hundred thirty pounds of air, merely gnawed and slid.\nThe timbermen now had room--but nothing to do. And Jones, who had been\nbiting at his mustache and ignoring the frantic walkie-talkie for\nminutes, stared grimly at watch and tape. Three minutes left, and over\neight feet to go.\n\n\"Gimme that armor!\" he rasped, and climbed the blocks. \"Open the air\nwide open--give 'er the whole two-fifty! Get down, Mac--I'll take it\nthe rest of the way!\"\n\nHe put his shoulders to the improvised yoke, braced his feet, and\nheaved. The burley, screaming and yelling and clamoring, went joyously\nto work--both ways--God, what punishment! The rotary, free and clear,\nchewed rock more viciously than ever. An armored hand smote his leg.\nLift! He lifted that foot, set it down two inches higher. The other\none. Four inches. Six. One foot. Two. Three. Lord of the ancients! Was\nthis lifetime of agony only one minute? Or wasn't he holding her--had\nthe damn thing stopped cutting? No, it was still cutting--the rocks\nwere banging against and bouncing off of his helmet as viciously and\nas numerously as ever; he could sense, rather than feel, the furious\nfashion in which the relays of timbermen were laboring to keep those\nhigh-stepping jacks in motion.\n\nNo, it had been only one minute. Twice that long yet to go. God!\nNothing _could_ be that brutal--a bull elephant couldn't take it--but\nby all the gods of space and all the devils in hell, he'd stay with\nit until that sag broke through. And grimly, doggedly, toward the end\nnine-tenths unconsciously, Lensman Conway Costigan stayed with it.\n\nAnd in the stope so far below, a new and highly authoritative voice\nblared from the speaker.\n\n\"Jones! God damn it, Jones, answer me! If Jones isn't there, somebody\nelse answer me--_anybody_!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir?\" Wright was afraid to answer that peremptory call, but more\nafraid not to.\n\n\"Jones? This is Clancy.\"\n\n\"No, sir. Not Jones. Wright, sir--top miner.\"\n\n\"Where's Jones?\"\n\n\"Up in the sag, sir. He's holding the burley--alone.\"\n\n\"_Alone!_ Hell's purple fires! Tell him to--how many men has he got on\nthe rotary?\"\n\n\"Two, sir. That's all they's room for.\"\n\n\"Tell him to quit it--put somebody else on it--I _won't_ have him\nkilled, damn it!\"\n\n\"He's the only one strong enough to hold it, sir, but I'll send up\nword.\" Word went up via sign language, and came back down. \"Beggin'\nyour pardon, sir, but he says to tell you to go to hell, sir. He won't\nhave no time for chit-chat, he says, until this goddam sag is through\nor the juice goes off, sir.\"\n\nA blast of profanity erupted from the speaker, of such violence\nthat the thoroughly scared Wright threw the walkie-talkie down the\nwaste-chute, and in the same instant the rotary crashed through.\n\nDazed, groggy, barely conscious from his terrific effort, Jones stared\nowlishly through the heavy, steel-braced lenses of his helmet while the\ntimbermen set a few more courses of wood and the rotary walked itself\nand the clinging burley up and out of the hole. He climbed stiffly out,\nand as he stared at the pillar of light flaring upward from the sag,\nhis gorge began to rise.\n\n\"Wha's the idea of that damn surveyor lying to us like that?\" he\nbabbled. \"We had oodles an' oodles of time--didn't have to kill\nourselves--damn water ain't got there _yet_--wha's the big....\" He\nwobbled weakly, and took one short step, and the lights went out. The\nsurveyor's estimate had been impossibly, accidentally close. They had\nhad a little extra time; but it was measured very easily in seconds.\n\nAnd Jones, logical to the end in a queerly addled way, stood in\nthe almost palpable darkness, and wobbled, and thought. If a man\ncouldn't see anything with his eyes wide open, he was either blind or\nunconscious. He wasn't blind, therefore he must be unconscious and not\nknow it. He sighed, wearily and gratefully, and collapsed.\n\nBattery lights were soon reconnected, and everybody knew that they had\nholed through. There was no more panic. And, even before the shift-boss\nhad recovered full consciousness, he was walking down the drift toward\nStation Eleven.\n\nThere is no need to enlarge upon the rest of that grim and grisly\naffair. Level after level was activated; and, since working upward\nin mines is vastly faster than working downward, the two parties met\non the Eighth Level. Half of the men who would otherwise have died\nwere saved, and--much more important from the viewpoint of Uranium,\nInc.--the deeper and richer half of the biggest and richest uranium\nmine in existence, instead of being out of production for a year or\nmore, would be back in full operation in a couple of weeks.\n\nAnd George Washington Jones, still a trifle shaky from his ordeal, was\ncalled into the front office. But before he arrived:\n\n\"I'm going to make him Assistant Works Manager,\" Clancy announced.\n\n\"I think not.\"\n\n\"But listen, Mr. Isaacson--_please_! How do you expect me to build up a\nstaff if you snatch every good man I find away from me?\"\n\n\"You didn't find him. Birkenfeld did. He was here only on a test. He is\ngoing into Department Q.\"\n\nClancy, who had opened his mouth to continue his protests, shut it\nwordlessly. He knew that department Q was--\n\nDEPARTMENT Q.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 15\n\n\nCostigan was not surprised to see the man he had known as Birkenfeld in\nUranium's ornate conference room. He had not expected, however, to see\nIsaacson. He knew, of course, that Spaceways owned Uranium, Inc., and\nthe planet Eridan, lock, stock, and barrel; but it never entered his\nmodest mind that his case would be of sufficient importance to warrant\nthe personal attention of the Big Noise himself. Hence the sight of\nthat suave and unrevealing face gave the putative Jones a more than\ntemporary qualm. Isaacson was top-bracket stuff, 'way out of his class.\nVirgil Samms ought to be taking this assignment, but since he wasn't--\n\nBut instead of being an inquisition, the meeting was friendly and\ninformal from the start. They complimented him upon the soundness of\nhis judgment and the accuracy of his decisions. They thanked him, both\nwith words and with a considerable sum of expendable credits. They\nencouraged him to talk about himself, but there was nothing whatever\nof the star-chamber or of cross-examination. The last question was\nrepresentative of the whole conference.\n\n\"One other thing, Jones, has me slightly baffled,\" Isaacson said, with\na really winning smile. \"Since you do not drink, and since you were not\nin search of feminine ... er ... companionship, just why did you go\ndown to Roaring Jack's dive?\"\n\n\"Two reasons,\" Jones said, with a somewhat shamefaced grin. \"The\nminor one isn't easy to explain, but ... well, I hadn't been having\nan exactly easy time of it on Earth ... you all know about that, I\nsuppose?\"\n\nThey knew.\n\n\"Well, I was taking a very dim view of things in general, and a good\nfight would get it out of my system. It always does.\"\n\n\"I see. And the major reason?\"\n\n\"I knew, of course, that I was on probation. I would have to get\npromoted, and fast, or stay sunk forever. To get promoted fast, a man\ncan either be enough of a boot-licker to be pulled up from on high,\nor he can be shoved up by the men he is working with. The best way to\nget a crowd of hard-rock men to like you is to lick a few of 'em--off\nhours, of course, and according to Hoyle--and the more of 'em you can\nlick at once, the better. I'm pretty good at rough-and-tumble brawling,\nso I gambled that the cops would step in before I got banged up too\nmuch. I won.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Isaacson said again, in an entirely different tone. He\ndid see, now. \"The first technique is so universally used that the\npossibility of the second did not occur to me. Nice work--_very_\nnice.\" He turned to the other members of the Board. \"This, I believe,\nconcludes the business of the meeting?\"\n\nFor some reason or other Isaacson nodded slightly as he asked the\nquestion; and one by one, as though in concurrence, the others nodded\nin reply. The meeting broke up. Outside the door, however, the magnate\ndid not go about his own business nor send Jones about his. Instead:\n\n\"I would like to show you, if I may, the above-ground part of our\nWorks?\"\n\n\"My time is yours, sir. I am interested.\"\n\nIt is unnecessary here to go into the details of a Civilization's\ngreatest uranium operation; the storage bins, the grinders, the\nWilfley tables and slime tanks, the flotation sluices, the roasters\nand reducers, the processes of solution and crystallization and\nrecrystallization, of final oxidation and reduction. Suffice it to say\nthat Isaacson showed Jones the whole immensity of Uranium Works Number\nOne. The trip ended on the top floor of the towering Administration\nBuilding, in a heavily-screened room containing a desk, a couple of\nchairs, and a tremendously massive safe.\n\n\"Smoke up.\" Isaacson indicated a package of Jones' favorite brand of\ncigarettes and lighted a cigar. \"You knew that you were under test. I\nwonder, though, if you knew how much of it was testing?\"\n\n\"All of it.\" Jones grinned. \"Except for the big blow, of course.\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"There were too many possibilities, of too many different kinds, too\npat. I might warn you, though--I could have got away clear with that\nhalf-million.\"\n\n\"The possibility existed.\" Surprisingly, Isaacson did not tell him that\nthe trap was more subtle than it had appeared to be. \"It was, however,\nworth the risk. Why didn't you?\"\n\n\"Because I figure on making more than that, a little later, and I might\nlive longer to spend it.\"\n\n\"Sound thinking, my boy--really sound. Now--you noticed, of course, the\nvote at the end of the meeting?\"\n\nJones had noticed it; and, although he did not say so, he had been\nwondering about it ever since. The older man strolled over to the safe\nand opened it, revealing a single, startlingly small package.\n\n\"You passed, unanimously; you are now learning what you have to know.\nNot that we trust you unreservedly. You will be watched for a long\ntime, and before you can make one false step, you will die.\"\n\n\"That would seem to be good business, sir.\"\n\n\"Glad you look at it that way--we thought you would. You saw the Works.\nQuite an operation, don't you think?\"\n\n\"Immense, sir. The biggest thing I ever saw.\"\n\n\"What would you say, then, to the idea of this office being our real\nheadquarters, of that little package there being our real business?\" He\nswung the safe door shut, spun the knob.\n\n\"It would have been highly surprising a couple of hours ago.\" Costigan\ncould not afford to appear stupid, nor to possess too much knowledge.\nHe had to steer an extremely difficult middle course. \"After the climax\nof this build-up, though, it wouldn't seem at all impossible. Or that\nthere were wheels--plenty of 'em!--within wheels.\"\n\n\"Smart!\" Isaacson applauded. \"And what would you think might be in that\npackage? This room is ray-proof.\"\n\n\"Against anything the Galactic Patrol can swing?\"\n\n\"Positively.\"\n\n\"Well, then, it _might_ be something beginning with the letter\" he\nflicked two fingers, almost invisibly fast, into a T and went on\nwithout a break \"M, as in morphine.\"\n\n\"Your caution and restraint are commendable. If I had any remaining\ndoubt as to your ability, it is gone.\" He paused, frowning. As belief\nin ability increased, that in sincerity lessened. This doubt, this\nquestioning, existed every time a new executive was initiated into the\nmysteries of Department Q. The Board's judgment was good. They had\nslipped only twice, and those two errors had been corrected easily\nenough. The fellow had been warned once; that was enough. He took the\nplunge. \"You will work with the Assistant Works Manager here until\nyou understand the duties of the position. You will be transferred to\nTellus as Assistant Works Manager there. Your principal duties will,\nhowever, be concerned with Department Q--which you will head up one\nday if you make good. And, just incidentally, when you go to Tellus, a\npackage like that one in the safe will go with you.\"\n\n\"Oh ... I see. I'll make good, sir.\" Jones let Isaacson see his\njaw-muscles tighten in resolve. \"It may take a little time for me to\nlearn my way around, sir, but I'll learn it.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you will. And now, to go into greater detail....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nVirgil Samms had to be sure of his facts. More than that, he had to be\nable to prove them; not merely to the satisfaction of a law-enforcement\nofficer, but beyond any reasonable doubt of the hardest-headed member\nof a cynical and skeptical jury. Wherefore Jack Kinnison and Mase\nNorthrop took up the thionite trail at the exact point where, each\ntrip, George Olmstead had had to abandon it; in the atmosphere of\nCavenda. And fortunately, not too much preparation was required.\n\nCavenda was, as has been intimated, a primitive world. Its native\npeople, humanoid in type, had developed a culture approximating in\nsome respects that of the North American Indian at about the time\nof Columbus, in others that of the ancient Nomads of Araby. Thus\na couple of wandering natives, unrecognizable under their dirty\nstormproof blankets and their scarcely thinner layers of grease and\ngrime, watched impassively, incuriously, while a box floated pendant\nfrom its parachute from sky to ground. Mounted upon their uncouth\nsteeds, they followed that box when it was hauled to the white\nman's village. Unlike many of the other natives, these two did not\nshuffle into that village, to lean silently against a rock or a wall\nawaiting their turns to exchange a few hours of simple labor for a\ncontainer of a new and highly potent beverage. They did, however,\nkeep themselves constantly and minutely informed as to everything\nthese strange, devil-ridden white men did. One of these pseudo-natives\nwandered off into the wilderness two or three days before the huge\nthing-which-flies-without-wings left ground; the other immediately\nafterward.\n\nThus the departure of the space-ship from Cavenda was recorded, as was\nits arrival at Eridan. It had been extremely difficult for the Patrol's\nengineers to devise ways and means of tracing that ship from departure\nto arrival without exciting suspicion, but it had not proved impossible.\n\nAnd Jack Kinnison, lounging idly and elegantly in the concourse\nof Danopolis Spaceport, seethed imperceptibly. Having swallowed a\ntiny Service Special capsule that morning, he knew that he had been\nunder continuous spy-ray inspection for over two hours. He had not\ngiven himself away--practically everybody screened their inside coat\npockets and hip pockets, and the cat-whisker lead from Lens to leg\nsimply could not be seen--but for all the good they were doing him his\nultra-instruments might just as well have been back on Tellus.\n\n\"Mase!\" he sent, with no change whatever in the vapid expression then\non his face. \"I'm still covered. Are you?\"\n\n\"Covered!\" the answering thought was a snort. \"They're covering me like\nwater covers a submarine!\"\n\n\"Keep tuned. I'll call Spud. Spud!\"\n\n\"Come in, Jack.\" Conway Costigan, alone now in the sanctum of\nDepartment Q, did not seem to be busy, but he was.\n\n\"That red herring they told us to drag across the trail was too damned\nred. They must be touchier than fulminate to spy-work on their armed\nforces--neither Mase nor I can do a lick of work. Anybody else covered?\"\n\n\"No. All clear.\"\n\n\"Good. Tell them the zwilnik blockers took us out.\"\n\n\"I'll do that. Distance only, or is somebody on your tail?\"\n\n\"Somebody; and I mean _some body_. A slick chick with a classy\nchassis; a blonde, with great, big come-hither eyes. Too good to be\ntrue; especially the falsies. Wiring, my friend--and I haven't been\nable to get a close look, but I wouldn't wonder if her nostrils had a\nskillionth of a whillimeter too much expansion. I want a spy-ray op--is\nit safe to use Fred?\" Kinnison referred to the grizzled engineer now\nputtering about in a certain space-ship; not the one in which he and\nNorthrop had come to Eridan.\n\n\"Definitely not. I can do it myself and still stay very much in\ncharacter.... No, I don't know her. Not surprising, of course, since\nthe policy here is never to let the right hand know what the left is\ndoing. How about you, Mase? Have you got a little girl-friend, too?\"\n\n\"Yea, verily, brother; but not little. More my size.\" Northrop pointed\nout a tall, trim brunette, strolling along with the effortless,\nconsciously unconscious poise of the professional model.\n\n\"Hm ... m ... m. I don't know her, either,\" Costigan reported, \"but\nboth of them are wearing four-inch spy-ray blocks and are probably\nwired up like Christmas trees. By inference, P-gun proof. I can't\npenetrate, of course, but maybe I can get a viewpoint.... You're right,\nJack. Nostrils plugged. Anti-thionite, anti-Vee-Two, anti-everything.\nIn fact, anti-social. I'll spread their pictures around and see if\nanybody knows either of them.\"\n\nHe did so, and over a hundred of the Patrol's shrewdest\noperatives--upon this occasion North America had invaded Eridan in\nforce--studied and thought. No one knew the tall brunette, but--\n\n\"I know the blonde.\" This was Parker of Washington, a Service ace for\ntwenty five years. \"'Hell-cat Hazel' DeForce, the hardest-boiled babe\nunhung. Watch your step around her; she's just as handy with a knife\nand knock-out drops as she is with a gun.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Parker. I've heard of her.\" Costigan was thinking fast.\n\"Free-lance. No way of telling who she's working for at the moment.\"\nThis was a statement, not a question.\n\n\"Only that it would have to be somebody with a lot of money. Her price\nis high. That all?\"\n\n\"That's all, fellows.\" Then, to Jack and Northrop: \"My thought is that\nyou two guys are completely out-classed--out-weighed, out-numbered,\nout-manned, and out-gunned. Undressed, you're sitting ducks; and if\nyou put out any screens it'll crystallize their suspicions and they'll\ngrab you right then--or maybe even knock you off. You'd better get out\nof here at full blast; you can't do any more good here, the way things\nare.\"\n\n\"Sure we can!\" Kinnison protested. \"You wanted a diversion, didn't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, but you already....\"\n\n\"What we've done already isn't a patch to what we can do next. We\ncan set up such a diversion that the boys can walk right on the\nthionite-carrier's heels without anybody paying any attention. By the\nway, you don't know yet who is going to carry it, do you?\"\n\n\"No. No penetration at all.\"\n\n\"You soon will, bucko. Watch our smoke!\"\n\n\"What do you think you're going to do?\" Costigan demanded, sharply.\n\n\"This.\" Jack explained. \"And don't try to say no. We're on our own, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"We ... l ... l ... it sounds good, and if you can pull it off it will\nhelp no end. Go ahead.\"\n\nThe demurely luscious blonde stared disconsolately at the bulletin\nboard, upon which another thirty minutes was being added to the\ntime of arrival of a ship already three hours late. She picked up\na book, glanced at its cover, put it down. Her hand moved toward a\nmagazine, drew back, dropped idly into her lap. She sighed, stifled a\nyawn prettily, leaned backward in her seat--in such a position, Jack\nnoticed, that he could not see into her nostrils--and closed her eyes.\nAnd Jack Kinnison, coming visibly to a decision, sat down beside her.\n\n\"Pardon me, miss, but I feel just like you look. Can you tell me why\nconvention decrees that two people, stuck in this concourse by arrivals\nthat nobody knows when will arrive, have got to suffer alone when they\ncould have so much more fun suffering together?\"\n\nThe girl's eyes opened slowly; she was neither startled, nor afraid,\nnor--it seemed--even interested. In fact, she gazed at him with so much\ndisinterest and for so long a time that he began to wonder--was she\ngoing to play sweet and innocent to the end?\n\n\"Yes, conventions _are_ stupid, sometimes,\" she admitted finally, her\nlovely lips curving into the beginnings of a smile. Her voice, low\nand sweet, matched perfectly the rest of her charming self. \"After\nall, perfectly nice people do meet informally on shipboard; why not in\nconcourses?\"\n\n\"Why not, indeed? And I'm perfectly nice people, I assure you. Willi\nBorden is the name. My friends call me Bill. And you?\"\n\n\"Beatrice Bailey; Bee for short. Tell me what you like, and we'll talk\nabout it.\"\n\n\"Why talk, when we could be eating? I'm with a guy. He's out on the\nfield somewhere--a big bruiser with a pencil-stripe black mustache.\nMaybe you saw him talking to me a while back?\"\n\n\"I think so, now that you mention him. Too big--_much_ too big.\" The\ngirl spoke carelessly, but managed to make it very clear that Jack\nKinnison was just exactly the right size. \"Why?\"\n\n\"I told him I'd have supper with him. Shall we hunt him up and eat\ntogether?\"\n\n\"Why not? Is he alone?\"\n\n\"He was, when I saw him last.\" Although Jack knew exactly where\nNorthrop was, and who was with him, he had to play safe; he did not\nknow how much this \"Bee Bailey\" really knew. \"He knows a lot more\npeople around here than I do, though, so maybe he isn't now. Let me\ncarry some of that plunder?\"\n\n\"You might carry those books--thanks. But the field is so _big_--how do\nyou expect to find him? Or do you know where he is?\"\n\n\"Uh-uh!\" he denied, vigorously. This was the critical moment. She\ncertainly wasn't suspicious--yet--but she was showing signs of not\nwanting to go out there, and if she refused to go.... \"To be honest, I\ndon't care whether I find him or not--the idea of ditching him appeals\nto me more and more. So how about this? We'll dash out to the third\ndock--just so I won't have to actually lie about looking for him--and\ndash right back here. Or wouldn't you rather have it a twosome?\"\n\n\"I refuse to answer, by advice of counsel.\" The girl laughed gaily, but\nher answer was plain enough.\n\nTheir rate of progress was by no means a dash, and Kinnison did not\nlook--with his eyes--for Northrop. Nevertheless, just south of the\nthird dock, the two young couples met.\n\n\"My cousin, Grace James,\" Northrop said, without a tremor or a quiver.\n\"Wild Willi Borden, Grace--usually called Baldy on account of his hair.\"\n\nThe girls were introduced; each vouchsafing the other a completely\nmeaningless smile and a colorlessly conventional word of greeting. Were\nthey, in fact as in seeming, total strangers? Or were they in fact\nworking together as closely as were the two young Lensmen themselves?\nIf that was acting, it was a beautiful job; neither man could detect\nthe slightest flaw in the performance of either girl.\n\n\"Whither away, pilot?\" Jack allowed no lapse of time. \"You know all the\nplaces around here. Lead us to a good one.\"\n\n\"This way, my old and fragrant fruit.\" Northrop led off with a\nflourish, and again Jack tensed. The walk led straight past the\nthird-class, apparently deserted dock of which a certain ultra-fast\nvessel was the only occupant. If nothing happened for fifteen more\nseconds....\n\nNothing did. The laughing, chattering four came abreast of the portal.\nThe door swung open and the Lensmen went into action.\n\nThey did not like to strong-arm women, but speed was their first\nconsideration, with safety a close second; and it is impossible\nfor a man to make speed while carrying a conscious, lithe, strong,\nheavily-armed woman in such a position that she cannot use fists, feet,\nteeth, gun or knife. An unconscious woman, on the other hand, can be\ncarried easily and safely enough. Therefore Jack spun his partner\naround, forced both of her hands into one of his. The free hand flashed\nupward toward the neck; a hard finger pressed unerringly against a\nnerve; the girl went limp. The two victims were hustled aboard and the\nspace-ship, surrounded now by full-coverage screen, took off.\n\nKinnison paid no attention to ship or course; orders had been given\nlong since and would be carried out. Instead, he lowered his burden to\nthe floor, spread her out flat, and sought out and removed item after\nitem of wiring, apparatus, and offensive and defensive armament. He did\nnot undress her--quite--but he made completely certain that the only\nweapons left to the young lady were those with which Nature had endowed\nher. And, Northrop having taken care of his alleged cousin with equal\nthoroughness, the small-arms were sent out and both doors of the room\nwere securely locked.\n\n\"Now, Hell-cat Hazel DeForce,\" Kinnison said, conversationally, \"You\ncan snap out of it any time--you've been back to normal for at least\ntwo minutes. You've found out that your famous sex-appeal won't work.\nThere's nothing loose you can grab, and you're too smart an operator\nto tackle me bare-handed. Who's the captain of your team--you or the\nclothes-horse?\"\n\n\"Clothes-horse!\" the statuesque brunette exclaimed, but her protests\nwere drowned out. The blonde could--and did--talk louder, faster, and\nrougher.\n\n\"Do you think you can get away with _this_?\" she demanded. \"Why,\nyou ...\" and the unexpurgated, trenchant, brilliantly detailed\ncharacterization could have seared its way through four-ply asbestos.\n\"And just what do you think you're going to do with me?\"\n\n\"As to the first, I think so,\" Kinnison replied, ignoring the\ndeep-space verbiage. \"As to the second--as of now I don't know. What\nwould you do if our situations were reversed?\"\n\n\"I'd blast you to a cinder--or else take a knife and....\"\n\n\"Hazel!\" the brunette cautioned sharply. \"Careful! You'll touch them\noff and they'll....\"\n\n\"Shut up, Jane! They won't hurt us any more than they have already;\nit's psychologically impossible. Isn't that true, copper?\" Hazel\nlighted a cigarette, inhaled deeply, and blew a cloud of smoke at\nKinnison's face.\n\n\"Pretty much so, I guess,\" the Lensman admitted, frankly enough, \"but\nwe can put you away for the rest of your lives.\"\n\n\"Space-happy? Or do you think I am?\" she sneered. \"What would you use\nfor a case? We're as safe as if we were in God's pocket. And besides,\nour positions _will_ be reversed pretty quick. You may not know it, but\nthe fastest ships in space are chasing us, right now.\"\n\n\"For once you're wrong. We've got plenty of legs ourselves and we're\nblasting for rendezvous with a task-force. But enough of this chatter.\nI want to know what job you're on and why you picked on us. Give.\"\n\n\"Oh, does 'oo?\" Hazel cooed, venomously. \"Come and sit on mama's lap,\nitty bitty soldier boy, and she'll tell you everything you want to\nknow.\"\n\nBoth Lensmen probed, then, with everything they had, but learned\nnothing of value. The women did not know what the Patrolmen were trying\nto do, but they were so intensely hostile that their mental blocks,\nunconscious although they were, were as effective as full-driven\nthought screens against the most insidious approaches the men could\nmake.\n\n\"Anything in their hand-bags, Mase?\" Jack asked, finally.\n\n\"I'll look.... Nothing much--just this,\" and the very tonelessness of\nNorthrop's voice made Jack look up quickly.\n\n\"Just a letter from the boy-friend.\" Hazel shrugged her shoulders.\n\"Nothing hot--not even warm--go ahead and read it.\"\n\n\"Not interested in what it says, but it might be smart to develop\nit, envelope and all, for invisible ink and whatnot.\" He did so,\ndeeming it a worth-while expenditure of time. He already knew what the\nhidden message was; but no one not of the Patrol should know that no\ntransmission of intelligence, however coded or garbled or disguised or\nby whatever means sent, could be concealed from any wearer of Arisia's\nLens.\n\n\"Listen, Hazel,\" Kinnison said, holding up the now slightly stained\npaper. \"'Three six two'--that's you, I suppose, and you're the squad\nleader--'Men mentioned previously being investigated stop assign three\nnine eight'--that must be you, Jane--'and make acquaintance stop if\nno further instructions received by eighteen hundred hours liquidate\nimmediately stop party one'.\"\n\nThe blond operative lost for the first time her brazen control.\n\"Why ... that code is _unbreakable_!\" she gasped.\n\n\"Wrong again, Gentle Alice. Some of us are specialists.\" He directed a\nthought at Northrop. \"This changes things slightly, Mase. I was going\nto turn them loose, but now I don't know. Better we take it up with the\nboss, don't you think?\"\n\n\"Pos-i-_tive_-ly!\"\n\nSamms was called, and considered the matter for approximately one\nminute. \"Your first idea was right, Jack. Let them go. The message\nmay be helpful and informative, but the women would not. They know\nnothing. Congratulations, boys, on the complete success of Operation\nRed Herring.\"\n\n\"Ouch!\" Jack grimaced mentally to his partner after the First Lensman\nhad cut off. \"They know enough to be in on bumping you and me off, but\nthat ain't important, says he!\"\n\n\"And it ain't, bub,\" Northrop grinned back. \"Moderately so, maybe, if\nthey had got us, but not at all so now they can't. The Lensmen have\nlanded and the situation is well in hand. It is written. Selah.\"\n\n\"Check. Let's wrap it up.\" Jack turned to the blonde. \"Come on, Hazel.\nOut. Number Four lifeboat. Do you want to come peaceably or shall I\nwork on your neck again?\"\n\n\"You could think of other places that would be more fun.\" She got up\nand stared directly into his eyes, her lip curling. \"That is, if you\nwere a _man_ instead of a sublimated Boy Scout.\"\n\nKinnison, without a word, wheeled and unlocked a door. Hazel swaggered\nforward, but the taller girl hung back. \"Are you sure there's air--and\nthey'll pick us up? Maybe they're going to make us breathe space....\"\n\n\"Huh? They haven't got the guts,\" Hazel sneered. \"Come on, Jane. Number\nFour, you said, darling?\"\n\nShe led the way. Kinnison opened the portal. Jane hurried aboard, but\nHazel paused and held out her arms.\n\n\"Aren't you even going to kiss mama goodbye, baby boy?\" she taunted.\n\n\"Better not waste much more time. We blow this boat, sealed or open,\nin fifteen seconds.\" By what effort Kinnison held his voice level and\nexpressionless, he hoped the wench would never know.\n\nShe looked at him, started to say something, looked again. She had gone\njust about as far as it was safe to go. She stepped into the boat and\nreached for the lever. And as the valve was swinging smoothly shut the\nmen heard a tinkling laugh, reminiscent of icicles breaking against\nsteel bells.\n\n\"Hell's--Brazen--Hinges!\" Kinnison wiped his forehead as the lifeboat\nshot away. Hazel was something brand new to him; a phenomenon with\nwhich none of his education, training, or experience had equipped him\nto cope. \"I've heard about the guy who got hold of a tiger by the tail,\nbut....\" His thought expired on a wondering, confused note.\n\n\"Yeah.\" Northrop was in no better case. \"We won--technically--I\nguess--or did we? That was a God-awful drubbing we took, mister.\"\n\n\"Well, we got away alive, anyway.... We'll tell Parker his dope is\ncorrect to the proverbial twenty decimals. And now that we've escaped,\nlet's call Spud and see how things came out.\"\n\nAnd Costigan-Jones assured them that everything had come out very\nwell indeed. The shipment of thionite had been followed without any\ndifficulty at all, from the space-ship clear through to Jones' own\noffice, and it reposed now in Department Q's own safe, under Jones'\npersonal watch and ward. The pressure had lightened tremendously, just\nas Kinnison and Northrop had thought it would, when they set up their\ndiversion. Costigan listened impassively to the whole story.\n\n\"Now _should_ I have shot her, or not?\" Jack demanded. \"Not whether I\n_could_ have or not--I couldn't--but _should_ I have, Spud?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\" Costigan thought for minutes. \"I don't think so.\nNo--not in cold blood. I couldn't have, either, and wouldn't if I\ncould. It wouldn't be worth it. Somebody will shoot her some day, but\nnot one of us--unless, of course, it's in a fight.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Spud; that makes me feel better. Off.\"\n\nCostigan-Jones' desk was already clear, since there was little or no\npaper-work connected with his position in Department Q. Hence his\npreparations for departure were few and simple. He merely opened the\nsafe, stuck the package into his pocket, closed and locked the safe,\nand took a company ground-car to the spaceport.\n\nNor was there any more formality about his leaving the planet. Eridan\nhad, of course, a Customs frontier of sorts; but since Uranium Inc.\nowned Eridan in fee simple, its Customs paid no attention whatever to\ncompany ships or to low-number, gold-badge company men. Nor did Jones\nneed ticket, passport, or visa. Company men rode company ships to and\nfrom company plants, wherever situated, without let or hindrance. Thus,\nwearing the aura of power of his new position--and Gold Badge Number\nThirty Eight--George W. Jones was whisked out to the uranium ship and\nwas shown to his cabin.\n\nNor was it surprising that the trip from Eridan to Earth was completely\nwithout incident. This was an ordinary freighter, hauling uranium on a\nroutine flight. Her cargo was valuable, of course--the sine qua non of\ninter-stellar trade--but in no sense precious. Not pirate-bait, by any\nmeans. And only two men knew that this flight was in any whit different\nfrom the one which had preceded it or the one which would follow it.\nIf this ship was escorted or guarded the fact was not apparent: and\nno Patrol vessel came nearer to it than four detets--Virgil Samms and\nRoderick Kinnison saw to that.\n\nThe voyage, however, was not tedious. Jones was busy every minute. In\nfact, there were scarcely minutes enough in which to assimilate the\nmaterial which Isaacson had given him--the layouts, flow-sheets, and\norganization charts of Works Number Eighteen, on Tellus.\n\nAnd upon arrival at the private spaceport which was an integral part\nof Works Number Eighteen, Jones was not surprised (he knew more now\nthan he had known a few weeks before; and infinitely more than the\nman on the street) to learn that the Customs men of this particular\nNorth American Port of Entry were just as complaisant as were those of\nEridan. They did not bother even to count the boxes, to say nothing\nof inspecting them. They stamped the ship's papers without either\nreading or checking them. They made a perfunctory search, it is true,\nof crewmen and quarters, but a low number gold badge was still a magic\ntalisman. Unquestioned, sacrosanct, he and his baggage were escorted to\nthe ground-car first in line.\n\n\"Administration Building,\" Jones-Costigan told the hacker, and that was\nthat.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 16\n\n\nIt has been said that the basic drive of the Eddorians was a lust\nfor power; a thought which should be elucidated and perhaps slightly\nmodified. Their warrings, their strifes, their internecine intrigues\nand connivings were inevitable because of the tremendousness and\ncapability--and the limitations--of their minds. Not enough _could_\noccur upon any one planet to keep such minds as theirs even partially\noccupied; and, unlike the Arisians, they could not satiate themselves\nin a static philosophical study of the infinite possibilities of the\nCosmic All. They had to be _doing_ something; or, better yet, making\nother and lesser beings do things to make the physical universe conform\nto their idea of what a universe should be.\n\nTheir first care was to set up the various echelons of control. The\nsecond echelon, immediately below the Masters, was of course the most\nimportant, and after a survey of both galaxies they decided to give\nthis high honor to the Ploorans. Ploor, as is now well known, was\na planet of a sun so variable that all Plooran life had to undergo\nradical cyclical changes in physical form in order to live through the\ntremendous climatic changes involved in its every year. Physical form,\nhowever, meant nothing to the Eddorians. Since no other planet even\nremotely like theirs existed in this, our normal plenum, physiques like\ntheirs would be impossible; and the Plooran mentality left very little\nto be desired.\n\nIn the third echelon there were many different races, among which the\nfrigid-blooded, poison-breathing Eich were perhaps the most efficient\nand most callous; and in the fourth there were millions upon millions\nof entities representing thousands upon thousands of widely-variant\nraces.\n\nThus, at the pinpoint in history represented by the time of Virgil\nSamms and Roderick Kinnison, the Eddorians were busy; and if such\na word can be used, happy. Gharlane of Eddore, second in authority\nonly to the All-Highest, His Ultimate Supremacy himself, paid little\nattention to any one planet or to any one race. Even such a mind as\nhis, when directing the affairs of twenty million and then sixty\nmillion and then a hundred million worlds, can do so only in broad, and\nnot in fine.\n\nAnd thus the reports which were now flooding in to Gharlane in a\nconstantly increasing stream concerned classes and groups of worlds,\nand solar systems, and galactic regions. A planet might perhaps be\nmentioned as representative of a class, but no individual entity\nlower than a Plooran was named or discussed. Gharlane analyzed those\ntremendous reports; collated, digested, compared, and reconciled them;\ndetermined trends and tendencies and most probable resultants. Gharlane\nissued orders, the carrying out of which would make an entire galactic\nregion fit more and ever more exactly into the Great Plan.\n\nBut, as has been pointed out, there was one flaw inherent in the\nBoskonian system. Underlings, then as now, were prone to gloss over\ntheir own mistakes, to cover up their own incompetences. Thus, since\nhe had no reason to inquire specifically, Gharlane did not know that\nanything whatever had gone amiss on Sol Three, the pestiferous planet\nwhich had formerly caused him more trouble than all the rest of his\nworlds combined.\n\nAfter the fact, it is easy to say that he should have continued\nhis personal supervision of Earth, but can that view be defended?\nEgotistical, self-confident, arrogant, Gharlane _knew_ that he had\nfinally whipped Tellus into line. It was the same now as any other\nplanet of its class. And even had he thought it worth while to make\nsuch a glaring exception, would not the fused Elders of Arisia have\nintervened?\n\nBe those things as they may, Gharlane did not know that the new-born\nGalactic Patrol had been successful in defending Triplanetary's Hill\nagainst the Black Fleet. Nor did the Plooran Assistant Director in\ncharge. Nor did any member of that dreadful group of Eich which was\neven then calling itself the Council of Boskone. The highest-ranking\nBoskonian who knew of the fiasco, calmly confident of his own ability,\nhad not considered this minor reverse of sufficient importance to\nreport to his immediate superior. He had already taken steps to\ncorrect the condition. In fact, as matters now stood, the thing was\nmore fortunate than otherwise, in that it would lull the Patrol into\nbelieving themselves in a position of superiority--a belief which\nwould, at election time, prove fatal.\n\nThis being, human to the limit of classification except for a faint but\nunmistakable blue coloration, had been closeted with Senator Morgan for\na matter of two hours.\n\n\"In the matters covered, your reports have been complete and\nconclusive,\" the visitor said finally, \"but you have not reported on\nthe Lens.\"\n\n\"Purposely. We are investigating it, but any report based upon our\npresent knowledge would be partial and inconclusive.\"\n\n\"I see. Commendable enough, usually. News of this phenomenon has,\nhowever, gone farther and higher than you think and I have been ordered\nto take cognizance of it; to decide whether or not to handle it myself.\"\n\n\"I am thoroughly capable of....\"\n\n\"I will decide that, not you.\" Morgan subsided. \"A partial report is\ntherefore in order. Go ahead.\"\n\n\"According to the procedure submitted and approved, a Lensman was\ntaken alive. Since the Lens has telepathic properties, and hence is\npresumably operative at great distances, the operation was carried out\nin the shortest possible time. The Lens, immediately upon removal from\nthe Patrolman's arm, ceased to radiate and the operative who held the\nthing died. It was then applied by force to four other men--workers,\nthese, of no importance. All four died, thus obviating all possibility\nof coincidence. An attempt was made to analyze a fragment of the active\nmaterial, without success. It seemed to be completely inert. Neither\nwas it affected by electrical discharges or by sub-atomic bombardment,\nnor by any temperatures available. Meanwhile, the man was of course\nbeing questioned, under truth-drug and beams. His mind denied any\nknowledge of the nature of the Lens; a thing which I am rather inclined\nto believe. His mind adhered to the belief that he obtained the Lens\nupon the planet Arisia. I am offering for your consideration my opinion\nthat the high-ranking officers of the Patrol are using hypnotism to\nconceal the real source of the Lens.\"\n\n\"Your opinion is accepted for consideration.\"\n\n\"The man died during examination. Two minutes after his death his Lens\ndisappeared.\"\n\n\"Disappeared? What do you mean? Flew away? Vanished? Was stolen?\nDisintegrated? Or what?\"\n\n\"No. More like evaporation or sublimation, except that there was no\ngradual diminution in volume, and there was no detectable residue,\neither solid, liquid, or gaseous. The platinum-alloy bracelet remained\nintact.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"The Patrol attacked in force and our expedition was destroyed.\"\n\n\"You are sure of these observational facts?\"\n\n\"I have the detailed records. Would you like to see them?\"\n\n\"Send them to my office. I hereby relieve you of all responsibility\nin the matter of the Lens. In fact, even I may decide to refer it to\na higher echelon. Have you any other material, not necessarily facts,\nwhich may have bearing?\"\n\n\"None,\" Morgan replied; and it was just as well for Virgilia Samms'\ncontinued well-being that the Senator did not think it worth while to\nmention the traceless disappearance of his Number One secretary and a\nfew members of a certain unsavory gang. To his way of thinking, the\nLens was not involved, except perhaps very incidentally. Herkimer, in\nspite of advice and orders, had probably got rough with the girl, and\nSamms' mob had rubbed him out. Served him right.\n\n\"I have no criticism of any phase of your work. You are doing a\nparticularly nice job on thionite. You are of course observing all\nspecified precautions as to key personnel?\"\n\n\"Certainly. Thorough testing and unremitting watchfulness. Our Mr.\nIsaacson is about to promote a man who has proved very capable. Would\nyou like to observe the proceedings?\"\n\n\"No. I have no time for minor matters. Your results have been\nsatisfactory. Keep them that way. Good-bye.\" The visitor strode out.\n\nMorgan reached for a switch, then drew his hand back. No. He would\nlike to sit in on the forthcoming interview, but he did not have the\ntime. He had tested Olmstead repeatedly and personally; he knew what\nthe man was. It was Isaacson's department; let Isaacson handle it. He\nhimself must work full time at the job which only he could handle; the\nNationalists must and would win this forthcoming election.\n\nAnd in the office of the president of Interstellar Spaceways, Isaacson\ngot up and shook hands with George Olmstead.\n\n\"I called you in for two reasons. First, in reply to your message that\nyou were ready for a bigger job. What makes you think that any such are\navailable?\"\n\n\"Do I need to answer that?\"\n\n\"Perhaps not ... no.\" The magnate smiled quietly. Morgan was right;\nthis man could not be accused of being dumb. \"There is such a job,\nyou are ready for it, and you have your successor trained in the work\nof harvesting. Second, why did you cut down, instead of increasing as\nordered, the weight of broadleaf per trip? This, Olmstead, is really\nserious.\"\n\n\"I explained why. It would have been more serious the other way. Didn't\nyou believe I knew what I was talking about?\"\n\n\"Your reasoning may have been distorted in transmittal. I want it\nstraight from you.\"\n\n\"Very well. It isn't smart to be greedy. There's a point at which\nsomething that has been merely a nuisance becomes a thing that _has_ to\nbe wiped out. Since I didn't want to be in that ferry when the Patrol\nblows it out of the ether, I cut down the take, and I advise you to\nkeep it down. What you're getting now is a lot more than you ever got\nbefore, and a _hell_ of a lot more than none at all. Think it over.\"\n\n\"I see. Upon what basis did you arrive at the figure you established?\"\n\n\"Pure guesswork, nothing else. I guessed that about three hundred\npercent of the previous average per month ought to satisfy anybody who\nwasn't too greedy to have good sense, and that more than that would\nring a loud, clear bell right where we don't want any noise made. So I\ncut it down to three, and advised Ferdy either to keep it at three or\nquit while he was still all in one piece.\"\n\n\"You exceeded your authority ... and were insubordinate ... but it\nwouldn't surprise me if you were right. You are certainly right in\nprinciple, and the poundage can be determined by statistical and\npsychological analysis. But in the meantime, there is tremendous\npressure for increased production.\"\n\n\"I know it. Pressure be damned. My dear cousin Virgil is, as you\nalready know, a crackpot. He is visionary, idealistic, full of sweet\nand beautiful concepts of what the universe would be like if there\nweren't so many people like you and me in it; but don't ever make the\nmistake of writing him off as anybody's fool. And you know, probably\nbetter than I do, what Rod Kinnison is like. If I were you I'd tell\nwhoever is doing the screaming to shut their damn mouths before they\nget their teeth kicked down their throats.\"\n\n\"I'm very much inclined to take your advice. And now as to this\nproposed promotion. You are of course familiar in a general way with\nour operation at Northport?\"\n\n\"I could scarcely help knowing _something_ about the biggest uranium\nworks on Earth. However, I am not well enough qualified in detail to\nmake a good technical executive.\"\n\n\"Nor is it necessary. Our thought is to make you a key man in a new and\nincreasingly important branch of the business, known as Department Q.\nIt is concerned neither with production nor with uranium.\"\n\n\"Q as in 'quiet', eh? I'm listening with both ears. What duties would\nbe connected with this ... er ... position? What would I really do?\"\n\nTwo pairs of hard eyes locked and held, staring yieldlessly into each\nother's depths.\n\n\"You would not be unduly surprised to learn that substances other than\nuranium occasionally reach Northport?\"\n\n\"Not _too_ surprised, no,\" Olmstead replied dryly. \"What would I do\nwith it?\"\n\n\"We need not go into that here or now. I offer you the position.\"\n\n\"I accept it.\"\n\n\"Very well. I will take you to Northport, and we will continue our talk\nen route.\"\n\nAnd in a spy-ray-proof, sound-proof compartment of a Spaceways-owned\nstratoliner they did so.\n\n\"Just for my information, Mr. Isaacson, how many predecessors have I\nhad on this particular job, and what happened to them? The Patrol get\nthem?\"\n\n\"Two. No; we have not been able to find any evidence that the Samms\ncrowd has any suspicion of us. Both were too small for the job; neither\ncould handle personnel. One got funny ideas, the other couldn't stand\nthe strain. If you don't get funny ideas, and don't crack up, you will\nmake out in a big--and I mean _really_ big--way.\"\n\n\"If I do either I'll be more than somewhat surprised.\" Olmstead's\nfeatures set themselves into a mirthless, uncompromising, somehow\nbitter grin.\n\n\"So will I.\" Isaacson agreed.\n\nHe knew what this man was, and just how case-hardened he was. He knew\nthat he had fought Morgan himself to a scoreless tie after twisting\nHerkimer--and he was no soft touch--into a pretzel in nothing flat. At\nthe thought of the secretary, so recently and so mysteriously vanished,\nthe magnate's mind left for a moment the matter in hand. What was\nat the bottom of that affair--the Lens or the woman? Or both? If he\nwere in Morgan's shoes ... but he wasn't. He had enough grief of his\nown, without worrying about any of Morgan's stinkeroos. He studied\nOlmstead's inscrutable, subtly sneering smile and knew that he had made\na wise decision.\n\n\"I gather that I am going to be one of the main links in the primary\nchain of deliveries. What's the technique, and how do I cover up?\"\n\n\"Technique first. You go fishing. You are an expert at that, I believe?\"\n\n\"You might say so. I won't have to do any faking there.\"\n\n\"Some week-end soon, and _every_ week-end later on, we hope, you will\nindulge in your favorite sport at some lake or other. You will take the\ncustomary solid and liquid refreshments along in a lunch-box. When you\nhave finished eating you will toss the lunch-box overboard.\"\n\n\"That all?\"\n\n\"That's all.\"\n\n\"The lunch-box, then, will be slightly special?\"\n\n\"More or less, although it will look ordinary enough. Now as to the\ncover-up. How would 'Director of Research' sound?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Depends on what the researchers are doing. Before I\nbecame an engineer I was a pure scientist of sorts; but that was quite\na while ago and I was never a specialist.\"\n\n\"That is one reason why I think you will do. We have plenty of\nspecialists--too many, I often think. They dash off in all directions,\nwithout rhyme or reason. What we want is a man with enough scientific\ntraining to know in general what is going on, but what he will need\nmostly is hard common sense, and enough ability--mental force, you\nmight call it--to hold the specialists down to earth and make them pull\ntogether. If you can do it--and if I didn't think you could I wouldn't\nbe talking to you--the whole force will know that you are earning your\npay; just as we could not hide the fact that your two predecessors\nweren't.\"\n\n\"Put that way it sounds good. I wouldn't wonder if I could handle it.\"\n\nThe conversation went on, but the rest of it is of little importance\nhere. The plane landed. Isaacson introduced the new Director of\nResearch to Works Manager Rand, who in turn introduced him to a few of\nhis scientists and to the svelte and spectacular red-head who was to be\nhis private secretary.\n\nIt was clear from the first that the Research Department was not going\nto be an easy one to manage. The top men were defiant, the middle ranks\nwere sullen, the smaller fry were apprehensive as well as sullen. The\nsecretary flaunted chips on both shapely shoulders. Men and women alike\nexpected the application of the old wheeze \"a new broom sweeps clean\"\nfor the third time in scarcely twice that many months, and they were\ndefying him to do his worst. Wherefore they were very much surprised\nwhen the new boss did nothing whatever for two solid weeks except read\nreports and get acquainted with his department.\n\n\"How d'ya like your new boss, May?\" another secretary asked, during a\nbreak.\n\n\"Oh, not too bad ... I guess.\" May's tone was full of reservations.\n\"He's quiet--sort of reserved--no passes or anything like that--it'd be\nfunny if I finally got a boss that had something on the ball, wouldn't\nit? But you know what, Molly?\" The red-head giggled suddenly. \"I had\na camera-fiend first, you know, with a million credits' worth of\nstereo-cams and such stuff, and then a golf-nut. I wonder what this Dr.\nOlmstead does with his spare cash?\"\n\n\"You'll find out, dearie, no doubt.\" Molly's tone gave the words a\nmeaning slightly different from the semantic one of their arrangement.\n\n\"I intend to, Molly--I _fully_ intend to.\" May's meaning, too, was not\nexpressed exactly by the sequence of words used. \"It must be tough, a\nboss's life. Having to sit at a desk or be in conference six or seven\nhours a day--when he isn't playing around somewhere--for a measly\nthousand credits or so a month. How do they get that way?\"\n\n\"You said it, May. You _really_ said it. But we'll get ours, huh?\"\n\nTime went on. George Olmstead studied reports, and more reports. He\nread one, and re-read it, frowning. He compared it minutely with\nanother; then sent red-headed May to hunt up one which had been turned\nin a couple of weeks before. He took them home that evening, and in the\nmorning he punched three buttons. Three stiffly polite young men obeyed\nhis summons.\n\n\"Good morning, Doctor Olmstead.\"\n\n\"Morning, boys. I'm not up on the fundamental theory of any one of\nthese three reports, but if you combine this, and this, and this,\"\nindicating heavily-penciled sections of the three documents, \"would\nyou, or would you not, be able to work out a process that would do away\nwith about three-quarters of the final purification and separation\nprocesses?\"\n\nThey did not know. It had not been the business of any one of them, or\nof all them collectively, to find out.\n\n\"I'm making it your business as of now. Drop whatever you're doing, put\nyour heads together, and find out. Theory first, then a small-scale\nlaboratory experiment. Then come back here on the double.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" and in a few days they were back.\n\n\"Does it work?\"\n\n\"In theory it should, sir, and on a laboratory scale it does.\" The\nthree young men were, if possible, even stiffer than before. It was not\nthe first time, nor would it be the last, that a Director of Research\nwould seize credit for work which he was not capable of doing.\n\n\"Good. Miss Reed, get me Rand ... Rand? Olmstead. Three of my boys\nhave just hatched out something that may be worth quite a few million\ncredits a year to us.... Me? Hell, no! Talk to them. I can't understand\nany one of the three parts of it, to say nothing of inventing it. I\nwant you to give 'em a class AAA priority on the pilot plant, as of\nright now. If they can develop it, and I'm betting they can, I'm going\nto put their pictures in the Northport News and give 'em a couple of\nthousand credits apiece and a couple of weeks vacation to spend it\nin.... Yeah, I'll send 'em in.\" He turned to the flabbergasted three.\n\"Take your dope in to Rand--now. Show him what you've got; then tear\ninto that pilot plant.\"\n\nAnd, a little later, Molly and May again met in the powder room.\n\n\"So your new boss is a _fisherman_!\" Molly snickered. \"And they say he\npaid over _two hundred credits_ for a _reel_! You were right, May; a\nboss's life must be mighty hard to take. And he sits around more and\ndoes less, they say, than any other exec in the plant.\"\n\n\"_Who_ says so, the dirty, sneaking liars?\" the red-head blazed,\ncompletely unaware that she had reversed her former position. \"And even\nif it _was_ so, which it isn't, he can do more work sitting perfectly\nstill than any other boss in the whole Works can do tearing around at\nforty parsecs a minute, so there!\"\n\nGeorge Olmstead was earning his salary.\n\nHis position was fully consolidated when, a few days later, a tremor of\nexcitement ran through the Research Department. \"Heads up, everybody!\nMr. Isaacson--himself--is coming--_here_! What for, I wonder? Y'don't\ns'pose he's going to take the Old Man away from us already, do you?\"\n\nHe came. He went through, for the first time, the entire department. He\nobserved minutely, and he understood what he saw.\n\nOlmstead led the Big Boss into his private office and flipped the\nswitch which supposedly rendered that sanctum proof against any and all\nforms of spying, eavesdropping, intrusion, and communication. It did\nnot, however, close the deeper, subtler channels which the Lensmen used.\n\n\"Good work, George. So _damned_ good that I'm going to have to take\nyou out of Department Q entirely and make you Works Manager of our new\nplant on Vegia. Have you got a man you can break in to take your place\nhere?\"\n\n\"Including Department Q? No.\" Although Olmstead did not show it, he\nwas disappointed at hearing the word \"Vegia\". He had been aiming much\nhigher than that--at the secret planet of the Boskonian Armed Forces,\nno less--but there might still be enough time to win a transfer there.\n\n\"Excluding. I've got another good man here now for that. Jones. Not\nheavy enough, though, for Vegia.\"\n\n\"In that case, yes. Dr. Whitworth, one of the boys who worked out the\nnew process. It'll take a little time, though. Three weeks minimum.\"\n\n\"Three weeks it is. Today's Friday. You've got things in shape, haven't\nyou, so that you can take the week-end off?\"\n\n\"I was figuring on it. I'm not going where I thought I was, though, I\nimagine.\"\n\n\"Probably not. Lake Chesuncook, on Route 273. Rough country, and the\nhotel is something less than fourth rate, but the fishing can't be\nbeat.\"\n\n\"I'm glad of that. When I fish, I like to catch something.\"\n\n\"It would smell if you didn't. They stock lunch-boxes in the cafeteria,\nyou know. Have your girl get you one, full of sandwiches and stuff.\nStart early this afternoon, as soon as you can after I leave. Be sure\nand see Jones, with your lunch-box, before you leave. Good-bye.\"\n\n\"Miss Reed, please send Whitworth in. Then skip down to the cafeteria\nand get me a lunch-box. Sandwiches and a thermos of coffee. Provender\nsuitable for a wet and hungry fisherman.\"\n\n\"Yes, _sir_!\" There were no chips now; the red-head's boss was the top\nace of the whole plant.\n\n\"Hi, Ned. Take the throne.\" Olmstead waved his hand at the now vacant\nchair behind the big desk. \"Hold it down 'til I get back. Monday,\nmaybe.\"\n\n\"Going fishing, huh?\" Gone was all trace of stiffness, of reserve, of\nunfriendliness. \"You big, lucky stiff!\"\n\n\"Well, my brilliant young squirt, maybe you'll get old and fat enough\nto go fishing yourself some day. Who knows? 'Bye.\"\n\nLunch-box in hand and encumbered with tackle, Olmstead walked blithely\nalong the corridor to the office of Assistant Works Manager Jones.\nWhile he had not known just what to expect, he was not surprised to see\na lunch-box exactly like his own upon the side-table. He placed his box\nbeside it.\n\n\"Hi, Olmstead.\" By no slightest flicker of expression did either\nLensman step out of character. \"Shoving off early?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Dropped by to let the Head Office know I won't be in 'til\nMonday.\"\n\n\"O.K. So'm I, but more speed for me. Chemquassabamticook Lake.\"\n\n\"Do you pronounce that or sneeze it? But have fun, my boy. I'm\ncombining business with pleasure, though--breaking in Whitworth on my\njob. That Fairplay thing is going to break in about an hour, and it'll\nscare the pants off of him. But it'll keep until Monday, anyway, and if\nhe handles it right he's just about in.\"\n\nJones grinned. \"A bit brutal, perhaps, but a sure way to find out.\n'Bye.\"\n\n\"So long.\" Olmstead strolled out, nonchalantly picking up the wrong\nlunch box on the way, and left the building.\n\nHe ordered his Dillingham, and tossed the lunch-box aboard as\ncarelessly as though it did not contain an unknown number of millions\nof credits' worth of clear-quill, uncut thionite.\n\n\"I hope you have a nice week-end, sir,\" the yard-man said, as he helped\nstow baggage and tackle.\n\n\"Thanks, Otto. I'll bring you a couple of fish Monday, if I catch that\nmany,\" and it should be said in passing that he brought them. Lensmen\nkeep their promises, under whatever circumstances or however lightly\ngiven.\n\nIt being mid-afternoon of Friday, the traffic was already heavy.\nNorthport was not a metropolis, of course; but on the other hand it did\nnot have metropolitan multi-tiered, one-way, non-intersecting streets.\nBut Olmstead was in no hurry. He inched his spectacular mount--it was\na violently iridescent chrome green in color, with highly polished\nchromium gingerbread wherever there was any excuse for gingerbread to\nbe--across the city and into the north-bound side of the superhighway.\nEven then, he did not hurry. He wanted to hit the inspection station at\nthe edge of the Preserve at dusk. Ninety miles an hour would do it. He\nworked his way into the ninety-mile lane and became motionless relative\nto the other vehicles on the strip.\n\nIt was a peculiar sensation; it seemed as though the cars themselves\nwere stationary, with the pavement flowing backward beneath them. There\nwas no passing, no weaving, no cutting in and out. Only occasionally\nwould the formation be broken as a car would shift almost imperceptibly\nto one side or the other; speeding up or slowing down to match the\nassigned speed of the neighboring way.\n\nThe afternoon was bright and clear, neither too hot nor too cold.\nOlmstead enjoyed his drive thoroughly, and arrived at the turn-off\nright on schedule. Leaving the wide, smooth way, he slowed down\nabruptly; even a Dillingham Super-Sporter could not make speed on the\nnarrow, rough, and hilly road to Chesuncook Lake.\n\nAt dusk he reached the Post. Instead of stopping on the pavement\nhe pulled off the road, got out, stretched hugely, and took a few\ndrum-major's steps to take the kinks out of his legs.\n\n\"A lot of road, eh?\" the smartly-uniformed trooper remarked. \"No guns?\"\n\n\"No guns.\" Olmstead opened up for inspection. \"From Northport.\nFunny, isn't it, how hard it is to stop, even when you aren't in any\nparticular hurry? Guess I'll eat now--join me in a sandwich and some\nhot coffee or a cold lemon sour or cherry soda?\"\n\n\"I've got my own supper, thanks; I was just going to eat. But did you\nsay a _cold_ lemon sour?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh. Ice-cold. Zero degrees Centigrade.\"\n\n\"I _will_ join you, in that case. Thanks.\"\n\nOlmstead opened a frost-lined compartment; took out two half-liter\nbottles; placed them and his open lunch-box invitingly on the low stone\nwall.\n\n\"Hm ... m ... m. Quite a zipper you got there, mister.\" The trooper\ngazed admiringly at the luxurious, two-wheeled monster; listened\nappreciatively to its almost inaudible hum. \"I've heard about those new\nsupers, but that is the first one I ever saw. Nice. All the comforts of\nhome, eh?\"\n\n\"Just about. Sure you won't help me clean up on those sandwiches,\nbefore they get stale?\"\n\nSeated on the wall, the two men ate and talked. If that trooper had\nknown what was in the box beside his leg he probably would have fallen\nover backward; but how was he even to suspect? There was nothing crass\nor rough or coarse about any of the work of any of Boskone's high-level\noperators.\n\nOlmstead drove on to the lake and took up his reservation at the\nramshackle hotel. He slept, and bright and early the next morning he\nwas up and fishing--and this part of the performance he really enjoyed.\nHe knew his stuff and the fish were there; big, wary, and game. He\nloved it.\n\nAt noon he ate, and quite openly and brazenly consigned the \"empty\"\nbox to the watery deep. Even if he had not had so many fish to carry,\nhe was not the type to lug a cheap lunch-box back to town. He fished\njoyously all afternoon, without getting quite the limit, and as the sun\ngrazed the horizon he started his putt-putt and skimmed back to the\ndock.\n\nThe thing hadn't sent out any radiation yet, Northrop informed him\ntensely, but it certainly would, and when it did they'd be ready. There\nwere Lensmen and Patrolmen all over the place, thicker than hair on a\ndog.\n\nAnd George Olmstead, sighing wearily and yet blissfully anticipatory of\none more day of enthralling sport, gathered up his equipment and his\nfish and strolled toward the hotel.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 17\n\n\nForty thousand miles from Earth's center the _Chicago_ loafed along\na circular arc, inert, at a mere ten thousand miles an hour; a speed\nwhich, and not by accident, kept her practically stationary above a\ncertain point on the planet's surface. Nor was it by chance that both\nVirgil Samms and Roderick Kinnison were aboard. And a dozen or so other\ncraft, cruisers and such, whose officers were out to put space-time in\ntheir logs, were flitting aimlessly about; but never very far away from\nthe flagship. And farther out--well out--a cordon of diesel-powered\ndetector ships swept space to the full limit of their prodigious reach.\nThe navigating officers of those vessels knew to a nicety the place\nand course of every ship lawfully in the ether, and the appearance of\neven one unscheduled trace would set in motion a long succession of\ncarefully-planned events.\n\nAnd far below, grazing atmosphere, never very far from the direct line\nbetween the _Chicago_ and Earth's core, floated a palatial pleasure\nyacht. And this craft carried not one Lensman, or two, but eight; two\nof whom kept their eyes fixed upon their observation plates. They were\nwatching a lunch-box resting upon the bottom of a lake.\n\n\"Hasn't it radiated _yet_?\" Roderick Kinnison demanded. \"Or been\napproached, or moved?\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" Lyman Cleveland replied, crisply. \"Neither Northrop's rig\nnor mine has shown any sign of activity.\"\n\nHe did not amplify the statement, nor was there need. Mason Northrop\nwas a Master Electronicist; Cleveland was perhaps the world's greatest\nliving expert. Neither of them had detected radiation. Ergo, none\nexisted.\n\nEqually certainly the box had not moved, or been moved, or approached.\n\"No change, Rod,\" Doctor Frederick Rodebush Lensed the assured thought.\n\"Six of us have been watching the plates in five-minute shifts.\"\n\nA few minutes later, however: \"Here is a thought which may be of\ninterest,\" DalNalten the Venerian announced, spraying himself with\na couple pints of water. \"It is natural enough, of course, for any\nVenerian to be in or on any water he can reach--I would enjoy very\nmuch being on or in that lake myself--but it may not be entirely by\ncoincidence that one particular Venerian, Ossmen, is visiting this\nparticular lake at this particular time.\"\n\n\"What!\" Nine Lensmen yelled the thought practically as one.\n\n\"Precisely. Ossmen.\" It was a measure of the Venerian Lensman's concern\nthat he used only two words instead of twenty or thirty. \"In the red\nboat with the yellow sail.\"\n\n\"Do you see any detector rigs?\" Samms asked.\n\n\"He wouldn't need any,\" DalNalten put in. \"He will be able to see it.\nOr, if a little colane had been rubbed on it which no Tellurian could\nhave noticed, any Venerian could smell it from one end of that lake to\nthe other.\"\n\n\"True. I didn't think of that. It may not have a transmitter after all.\"\n\n\"Maybe not, but keep on listening, anyway,\" the Port Admiral ordered.\n\"Bend a plate on Ossmen, and a couple more on the rest of the boats.\nBut Ossmen is clean, you say, Jack? Not even a spy-ray block?\"\n\n\"He couldn't have a block, Dad. It'd give too much away, here on our\nhome grounds. Like on Eridan, where their ops could wear anything\nthey could lift, but we had to go naked.\" He flinched mentally as he\nrecalled his encounter with Hazel the Hell-cat, and Northrop flinched\nwith him.\n\n\"That's right, Rod,\" Olmstead in his boat below agreed, and Conway\nCostigan, in his room in Northport, concurred. The top-drawer\noperatives of the enemy depended for safety upon perfection of\ntechnique, not upon crude and dangerous mechanical devices.\n\n\"Well, since you're all so sure of it, I'll buy it,\" and the waiting\nwent on.\n\nUnder the slight urge of the light and vagrant breeze, the red boat\nmoved slowly across the water. A somnolent, lackadaisical youth, who\nvery evidently cared nothing about where the boat went, sat in its\nstern, with his left arm draped loosely across the tiller. Nor was\nOssmen any more concerned. His only care, apparently, was to avoid\ninterference with the fishermen; his under-water jaunts were long, even\nfor a Venerian, and he entered and left the water as smoothly as only a\nVenerian--or a seal--could.\n\n\"However, he could have, and probably has got, a capsule spy-ray\ndetector,\" Jack offered, presently. \"Or, since a Venerian can swallow\nanything one inch smaller than a kitchen stove, he could have a whole\nanalyzing station stashed away in his stomach. Nobody's put a beam on\nhim yet, have you?\"\n\nNobody had.\n\n\"It might be smart not to. Watch him with 'scopes ... and when he gets\nup close to the box, better pull your beams off of it. DalNalten, I\ndon't suppose it would be quite bright for you to go swimming down\nthere too, would it?\"\n\n\"Very definitely not, which is why I am up here and dry. None of them\nwould go near it.\"\n\nThey waited, and finally Ossmen's purposeless wanderings brought him\nover the spot on the lake's bottom which was the target of so many\nTellurian eyes. He gazed at the discarded lunch-box as incuriously as\nhe had looked at so many other sunken objects, and swam over it as\ncasually--and only the ultra-cameras caught what he actually did. He\nswam serenely on.\n\n\"The box is still there,\" the spy-ray men reported, \"but the package is\ngone.\"\n\n\"Good!\" Kinnison exclaimed, \"Can you 'scopists see it on him?\"\n\n\"Ten to one they can't,\" Jack said. \"He swallowed it. I expected him to\nswallow it box and all.\"\n\n\"We can't see it, sir. He must have swallowed it.\"\n\n\"Make sure.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.... He's back on the boat now and we've shot him from all\nangles. He's clean--nothing outside.\"\n\n\"Perfect! That means he isn't figuring on slipping it to somebody else\nin a crowd. This will be an ordinary job of shadowing from here on in,\nso I'll put in the umbrella.\"\n\nThe detector ships were recalled. The _Chicago_ and the various other\nships of war returned to their various bases. The pleasure craft\nfloated away. But on the other hand there were bursts of activity\nthroughout the forest for a mile or so back from the shores of the\nlake. Camps were struck. Hiking parties decided that they had hiked\nenough and began to retrace their steps. Lithe young men, who had been\ndoing this and that, stopped doing it and headed for the nearest trails.\n\nFor Kinnison _pere_ had erred slightly in saying that the rest of\nthe enterprise was to be an ordinary job of shadowing. No ordinary\njob would do. With the game this nearly in the bag it must be made\nabsolutely certain that no suspicion was aroused, and yet Samms had to\nhave _facts_. Sharp, hard, clear facts; facts so self-evidently facts\nthat no intelligence above idiot grade could possibly mistake them for\nanything but facts.\n\nWherefore Ossmen the Venerian was not alone thenceforth. From lake to\nhotel, from hotel to car, along the road, into and in and out of train\nand plane, clear to an ordinary-enough-looking building in an ordinary\nbusiness section of New York, he was _never_ alone. Where the traveling\npopulation was light, the Patrol operatives were few and did not crowd\nthe Venerian too nearly; where dense, as in a metropolitan station,\nthey ringed him three deep.\n\nHe reached his destination, which was of course spy-ray proofed, late\nSunday night. He went in, remained briefly, came out.\n\n\"Shall we spy-ray him, Virge? Follow him? Or what?\"\n\n\"No spy-rays. Follow him. Cover him like a blanket. At the usual time\ngive him the usual spy-ray going-over, but not until then. This time,\nmake it _thorough_. Make certain that he hasn't got it on him, in him,\nor in or around his house.\"\n\n\"There'll be nothing doing here tonight, will there?\"\n\n\"No, it would be too noticeable. So you, Fred, and Lyman, take the\nfirst trick; the rest of us will get some sleep.\"\n\nWhen the building opened Monday morning the Lensmen were back, with\ndozens of others, including Knobos of Mars. There were also present or\nnearby literally hundreds of the shrewdest, most capable detectives of\nEarth.\n\n\"So _this_ is their headquarters--one of them at least,\" the Martian\nthought, studying the trickle of people entering and leaving the\nbuilding. \"It is as we thought, Dal, why we could never find it, why we\ncould never trace any wholesaler backward. None of us has ever seen any\nof these persons before. Complete change of personnel per operation;\nprobably inter-planetary. Long periods of quiescence. Check?\"\n\n\"Check: but we have them now.\"\n\n\"Just like that, huh?\" Jack Kinnison jibed; and from his viewpoint his\nidea was the more valid, for the wholesalers were very clever operators\nindeed.\n\nFrom the more professional viewpoint of Knobos and DalNalten, however,\nwho had fought a steadily losing battle so long, the task was not too\ndifficult. Their forces were beautifully organized and synchronized;\nthey were present in such overwhelming numbers that \"tails\" could be\nchanged every fifteen seconds; long before anybody, however suspicious,\ncould begin to suspect any one shadow. Nor was it necessary for the\ntails to signal each other, however inconspicuously, or to indicate\nany suspect at change-over time. Lensed thoughts directed every move,\nwithout confusion or error.\n\nAnd there were tiny cameras with tremendous, protuberant lenses, the\n\"long eyes\" capable of taking wire-sharp close ups from five hundred\nfeet; and other devices and apparatus and equipment too numerous to\nmention here.\n\nThus the wholesalers were traced and their transactions with the retail\npeddlers were recorded. And from that point on, even Jack Kinnison had\nto admit that the sailing was clear. These small fry were not smart,\nand their customers were even less so. None had screens or detectors\nor other apparatus; their every transaction could be and was recorded\nfrom a distance of many miles by the ultra-instruments of the Patrol.\nAnd not only the transactions. Clearly, unmistakeably, the purchaser\nwas followed from buying to sniffing; nor was the time intervening\never long. Thionite, then as now, was bought at retail only to use,\nand the whole ghastly thing went down on tape and film. The gasping,\nhysterical appeal; the exchange of currency for drug; the headlong rush\nto a place of solitude; the rigid muscle-lock and the horribly ecstatic\ntransports; the shaken, soul-searing recovery or the entranced death.\nIt all went on record. It was sickening to have to record such things.\nMore than one observer did sicken in fact, and had to be relieved. But\nVirgil Samms had to have concrete, positive, irrefutable evidence. He\ngot it. Any possible jury, upon seeing that evidence, would know it to\nbe the truth; no possible jury, after seeing that evidence, could bring\nin any verdict other than \"guilty\".\n\nOddly enough, Jack Kinnison was the only casualty of that long and\nhectic day. A man--later proved to be a middle-sized potentate of the\nunderworld--who was not even under suspicion at the time, for some\nreason or other got the idea that Jack was after him. The Lensman\nhad, perhaps, allowed some part of his long eye to show; a fast and\nefficient long-range telephoto lens is a devilishly awkward thing to\nconceal. At any rate the racketeer sent out a call for help, just\nin case his bodyguards would not be enough, and in the meantime his\npersonal attendants rallied enthusiastically around.\n\nThey had two objects in view; One, to pass a knife expeditiously\nand quietly through young Kinnison's throat from ear to ear; and:\nTwo, to tear the long eye apart and subject a few square inches of\nsuper-sensitive emulsion to the bright light of day. And if the Big\nShot had known that the photographer was not alone, that the big,\nhulking bruiser a few feet away was also a bull, they might have\nsucceeded.\n\nTwo of the four hoods reached Jack just fractionally ahead of the\nother two; one to seize the camera, the other to swing the knife.\nBut Jack Kinnison was fast; fast of brain and nerve and muscle. He\nsaw them coming. In three flashing motions he bent the barrel of the\ntelephoto into a neat arc around the side of the first man's head,\nducked frantically under the fiercely-driven knife, and drove the toe\nof his boot into the spot upon which prize-fighters like to have their\nrabbit-punches land. Both of those attackers lost interest promptly.\nOne of them lost interest permanently; for a telephoto lens in barrel\nis heavy, very rigid, and very, _very_ hard.\n\nWhile Battling Jack was still off balance, the other two guards\narrived--but so did Mason Northrop. Mase was not quite as fast as Jack\nwas; but, as has been pointed out, he was bigger and much stronger.\nWhen he hit a man, with either hand, that man dropped. It was the same\nas being on the receiving end of the blow of a twenty-pound hammer\nfalling through a distance of ninety seven and one-half feet.\n\nThe Lensmen had of course also yelled for help, and it took only a\nsplit second for a Patrol speedster to travel from any given point to\nany other in the same county. It took no time at all for that speedster\nto fill a couple of square blocks with patterns of force through which\nneither bullets nor beams could be driven. Therefore the battle ended\nas suddenly as it began; before more thugs, with their automatics and\nportables, could reach the scene.\n\nKinnison _fils_ cursed and damned fulminantly the edict which had\nforbidden arms that day, and swore that he would never get out of bed\nagain without strapping on at least two blasters; but he had to admit\nfinally that he had nothing to squawk about. Kinnison _pere_ explained\nquite patiently--for him--that all he had got out of the little fracas\nwas a split lip, that young Northrop's hair wasn't even mussed, and\nthat if everybody had been packing guns some scatter-brained young damn\nfool like him would have started blasting and blown everything higher\nthan up--would have spoiled Samms' whole operation maybe beyond repair.\nNow would he please quit bellyaching and get to hell out?\n\nHe got.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"That buttons thionite up, don't you think?\" Rod Kinnison asked. \"And\nthe lawyers will have plenty of time to get the case licked into shape\nand lined up for trial.\"\n\n\"Yes and no.\" Samms frowned in thought. \"The _evidence_ is complete,\nfrom original producer to ultimate consumer; but our best guess is that\nit will take years to get the really important offenders behind bars.\"\n\n\"Why? I thought you were giving them altogether too much time when you\nscheduled the blow-off for three weeks ahead of election.\"\n\n\"Because the drug racket is only a small part of it. We're going\nto break the whole thing at once, you know, and Mateese covers\na lot more ground--murder, kidnapping, bribery, corruption,\nmisfeasance--practically everything you can think of.\"\n\n\"I know. What of it?\"\n\n\"Jurisdiction, among other things. With the President, over half of the\nCongress, much of the judiciary, and practically all of the political\nbosses and police chiefs of the Continent under indictment at once, the\nlegal problem becomes incredibly difficult. The Patrol's Department of\nLaw has been working on it twenty four hours a day, and the only thing\nthey seem sure of is a long succession of bitterly-contested points of\nlaw. There are no precedents whatever.\"\n\n\"Precedents be damned! They're guilty and everybody knows it. We'll\nchange the laws so that....\"\n\n\"We will _not_!\" Samms interrupted, sharply. \"We want and we will have\ngovernment by law, not by men. We have had too much of that already.\nSpeed is not of the essence; justice very definitely is.\"\n\n\"'Crusader' Samms, now and forever! But I'll buy it, Virge--now let's\nget back down to earth. Operation Zwilnik is all set. Mateese is going\ngood. Zabriska tied into Zwilnik. That leaves Operation Boskone, which\nis, I suppose, still getting nowhere fast.\"\n\nThe First Lensman did not reply. It was, and both men knew it. The\nshrewdest, most capable and experienced operatives of the Patrol\nhad hit that wall with everything they had, and had simply bounced.\nLow-level trials had found no point of contact, no angle of approach.\nMiddle level, ditto. George Olmstead, working at the highest possible\nlevel, was morally certain that he had found a point of contact, but\nhad not been able to do anything with it.\n\n\"How about calling a Council conference on it?\" Kinnison asked finally.\n\"Or Bergenholm at least? Maybe he can get one of his hunches on it.\"\n\n\"I have discussed it with them all, just as I have with you. No one had\nanything constructive to offer, except to go ahead with Bennett as you\nare doing. The concensus is that the Boskonians know just as much about\nour military affairs as we know about theirs--no more.\"\n\n\"It _would_ be too much to expect them to be dumb enough to figure us\nas dumb enough to depend only on our visible Grand Fleet, after the\nwarning they gave us at The Hill,\" Kinnison admitted.\n\n\"Yes. What worries me most is that they had a running start.\"\n\n\"Not enough to count,\" the Port Admiral declared. \"We can out-produce\n'em and out-fight 'em.\"\n\n\"Don't be over-optimistic. You can't deny them the possession of\nbrains, ability, man-power and resources at least equal to ours.\"\n\n\"I don't have to.\" Kinnison remained obstinately cheerful. \"Morale,\nmy boy, is what counts. Man-power and tonnage and fire-power are\nimportant, of course, but morale has won every war in history. And our\nmorale right now is higher than a cat's back--higher than any time\nsince John Paul Jones--and getting higher by the day.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" The question was monosyllabic but potent.\n\n\"Yes. I mean just that--_yes_. From what we know of their system they\n_can't_ have the morale we've got. Anything they can do we can do more\nof and better. What you've got, Virge, is a bad case of ingrowing\nnerves. You've never been to Bennett, in spite of the number of times\nI've asked you to. I say take time right now and come along--it'll be\ngood for what ails you. It will also be a very fine thing for Bennett\nand for the Patrol--you'll find yourself no stranger there.\"\n\n\"You may have something there ... I'll do it.\"\n\nPort Admiral and First Lensman went to Bennett, not in the _Chicago_\nor other superdreadnaught, but in a two-man speedster. This was\nnecessary because space-travel, as far as that planet was concerned,\nwas a strictly one-way affair except for Lensmen. Only Lensmen could\nleave Bennett, under any circumstances or for any reason whatever.\nThere was no out-going mail, express, or freight. Even the war-vessels\nof the Fleet, while on practice maneuvers outside the bottle-tight\nenvelopes surrounding the system, were so screened that no unauthorized\ncommunication could possibly be made.\n\n\"In other words,\" Kinnison finished explaining, \"we slapped on\neverything anybody could think of, including Bergenholm and Rularion;\nand believe me, brother, that was a lot of stuff.\"\n\n\"But wouldn't the very fact of such rigid restrictions operate against\nmorale? It is a truism of psychology that imprisonment, like everything\nelse, is purely relative.\"\n\n\"Yeah, that's what I told Rularion, except I used simpler and rougher\nlanguage. You know how sarcastic and superior he is, even when he's\nwrong?\"\n\n\"_How_ I know!\"\n\n\"Well, when he's right he's too damned insufferable for words. You'd've\nthought he was talking to the prize boob of a class of half-wits.\nAs long as nobody on the planet knew that there was any such thing\nas space-travel, or suspected that they were not the only form of\nintelligent life in the universe, it was all right. No such concept\nas being planet-bound could exist. They had all the room there was.\nBut after they met us, and digested all the implications, they would\ndevelop the colly-wobbles no end. This, of course, is an extreme\nsimplification of the way the old coot poured it into me; but he came\nthrough with the solution, so I took it like a little man.\"\n\n\"What was the solution?\"\n\n\"It's a shame you were too busy to come in on it. You'll see when we\nland.\"\n\nBut Virgil Samms was quick on the uptake. Even before they landed,\nhe understood. When the speedster slowed down for atmosphere he saw\nblazoned upon the clouds a welter of one many-times repeated signal;\nas they came to ground he saw that the same set of symbols was\nrepeated, not only upon every available cloud, but also upon airships,\ncaptive balloons, streamers, roofs and sides of buildings--even, in\nmulti-colored rocks and flower-beds, upon the ground itself.\n\n\"Twenty Haress,\" Samms translated, and frowned in thought. \"A date of\nthe Bennettan year. Would it by any chance happen to coincide with our\nTellurian November fourteenth of this present year?\"\n\n\"Bright boy!\" Kinnison applauded. \"I thought you'd get it, but not so\nfast. Yes--election day.\"\n\n\"I see. They know what is going on, then?\"\n\n\"Everything that counts. They know what we stand to win--and lose.\nThey've named it Liberation Day, and everything on the planet is\nbuilding up to it in a grand crescendo. I was a little afraid of it at\nfirst, but if the screens are really tight it won't make any difference\nhow many people know it, and if they aren't the beans would all be\nspilled anyway. And it really works--I get a bigger thrill every time I\ncome here.\"\n\n\"I can see where it might work.\"\n\nBennett was a fully Tellurian world in mass, in atmosphere and in\nclimate; her native peoples were human to the limit of classification,\nboth physically and mentally. And First Lensman Samms, as he toured it\nwith his friend, found a world aflame with a zeal and an ardor unknown\nto blase Earth since the days of the Crusades. The Patrol's cleverest\nand shrewdest psychologists, by merely sticking to the truth, had done\na marvelous job.\n\nBennett knew that it was the Arsenal and the Navy Yard of Civilization,\nand it was proud of it. Its factories were humming as they had never\nhummed before; every industry, every business, every farm was operating\nat one hundred percent of capacity. Bennett was dotted and spattered\nwith spaceports already built, and hundreds more were being rushed to\ncompletion. The already staggering number of ships of war operating out\nof those ports was being augmented every hour by more and ever more\nultra-modern, ultra-fast, ultra-powerful shapes.\n\nIt was an honor to help build those ships; it was a still greater one\nto help man them. Competitive examinations were being held constantly,\nnor were all or even most of the applicants native Bennettans.\n\nSamms did not have to ask where these young people were coming\nfrom. He knew. From all the planets of Civilization, attracted by\ncarefully-worded advertisements of good jobs at high pay on new and\nhighly secret projects on newly discovered planets. There were hundreds\nof such ads. Most were probably the Patrol's, and led here; many were\nof Spaceways, Uranium Incorporated, and other mercantile firms. The\npossibility that some of them might lead to what was now being called\nBoskonia had been tested thoroughly, but with uniformly negative\nresults. Lensmen had applied by scores for those non-Patrol jobs and\nhad found them bona-fide. The conclusion was unavoidable--Boskone was\ndoing its recruiting on planets unknown to any wearer of Arisia's Lens.\nOn the other hand, more than a trickle of Boskonians were applying for\nPatrol jobs, but Samms was almost certain that none had been accepted.\nThe final screening was done by Lensmen, and in such matters Lensmen\ndid not make many or serious mistakes.\n\nBennett had been informed of the First Lensman's arrival, and Kinnison\nhad been guilty of a gross understatement indeed in telling Samms that\nhe would not be regarded as a stranger. Wherever Samms went he was met\nby wildly enthusiastic crowds. He had to make speeches, each of which\nwas climaxed by a tremendous roar of \"TO LIBERATION DAY!\"\n\n\"No Lensman material here, you say, Rod?\" Samms asked, after the\nfirst city-shaking demonstration was over. One of his prime concerns,\nthroughout his life, was this. \"With all this enthusiasm? Sure?\"\n\n\"We haven't found any good enough to refer to you yet. However, in\na few years, when the younger generation gets a little older, there\ncertainly will be.\"\n\n\"Check.\" The tour of inspection and acquaintance was finished, the two\nLensmen started back to Earth.\n\n\"Well, my skeptical and pessimistic friend, was I lying, or not?\"\nKinnison asked, as soon as the speedster's ports were sealed. \"Can they\nmatch that or not?\"\n\n\"You weren't--and I don't believe they can. I have never seen anything\nlike it. Autocracies have parades and cheers and demonstrations, of\ncourse, but they have always been forced--artificial. Those were\nspontaneous.\"\n\n\"Not only that, but the enthusiasm will carry through. We'll be piping\nhot and ready to go. But about this stumping--you said I'd better start\nas soon as we get back?\"\n\n\"Within a few days, I'd say.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't wonder, so let's use this time in working out a plan of\ncampaign. My idea is to start out like this....\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 18\n\n\nConway Costigan, leaving behind him scores of clues, all highly\nmisleading, severed his connection with Uranium, Inc. as soon as he\ndared after Operation Zwilnik had been brought to a successful close.\nThe technical operation, that is; the legal battles in which it figured\nso largely were to run on for enough years to make the word \"zwilnik\"\na common noun and adjective in the language.\n\nHe came to Tellus as unobtrusively as was his wont, and took an\ninconspicuous but very active part in Operation Mateese, now in full\nswing.\n\n\"Now is the time for all good men and true to come to the aid of the\nparty, eh?\" Clio Costigan giggled.\n\n\"You can play that straight across the keyboard of your electric, pet,\nand not with just two fingers, either. Did you hear what the boss told\n'em today?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" The girl's levity disappeared. \"They're so _dirty_, Spud--I'm\nreally afraid.\"\n\n\"So am I. But we're not too lily-fingered ourselves if we have to be,\nand we're covering 'em like a blanket--Kinnison and Samms both.\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\n\"And in that connection, I'll have to be out half the night again\ntonight. All right?\"\n\n\"Of course. It's so nice having you home at all, darling, instead of a\nmillion light-years away, that I'm practically delirious with delight.\"\n\nIt was sometimes hard to tell what impish Mrs. Costigan meant by what\nshe said. Costigan looked at her, decided she was taking him for a\nride, and smacked her a couple of times where it would do the most\ngood. He then kissed her thoroughly and left. He had very little time,\nthese days, either to himself or for his lovely and adored wife.\n\nFor Roderick Kinnison's campaign, which had started out rough and\nnot too clean, became rougher and rougher, and no cleaner, as it\nwent along. Morgan and his crew were swinging from the heels, with\neverything and anything they could dig up or invent, however little\nof truth or even of plausibility it might contain, and Rod the Rock\nhad never held even in principle with the gentle precept of turning\nthe other cheek. He was rather an Old Testamentarian, and he was no\nneophyte at dirty fighting. As a young operative, skilled in the\npunishing, maiming techniques of hand-to-hand rough-and-tumble combat,\nhe had brawled successfully in most of the dives of most of the\nsolarian planets and of most of their moons. With this background,\nand being a quick study, and under the masterly coaching of Virgil\nSamms, Nels Bergenholm, and Rularion of North Polar Jupiter, it did\nnot take him long to learn the various gambits and ripostes of this\nnon-physical, but nevertheless no-holds-barred, political mayhem.\n\nAnd the \"boys and girls\" of the Patrol worked like badgers, digging up\nan item here and a fact there and a bit of information somewhere else,\nall for the day of reckoning which was to come. They used ultra-wave\nscanners, spy-rays, long eyes, stool-pigeons--everything they could\nthink of to use--and they could not _always_ be blocked out or evaded.\n\n\"We've _got_ it, boss--now let's _use_ it!\"\n\n\"No. Save it! Nail it down, solid! Get the facts--names, dates, places,\nand amounts. Prove it first--then save it!\"\n\n_Prove it! Save it!_ The joint injunction was used so often that it\ncame to be a slogan and was accepted as such. Unlike most slogans,\nhowever, it was carefully and diligently put to use. The operatives\nproved it and saved it, over and over, over and over again; by dint of\nwhat unsparing effort and selfless devotion only they themselves ever\nfully knew.\n\nKinnison stumped the Continent. He visited every state, all of the\nbig cities, most of the towns, and many villages and hamlets; and\nalways, wherever he went, a part of the show was to demonstrate to his\naudiences how the Lens worked.\n\n\"Look at me. You know that no two individuals are or ever can be alike.\nRobert Johnson is not like Fred Smith; Joe Jones is entirely different\nfrom John Brown. Look at me again. Concentrate upon whatever it is in\nyour mind that makes me Roderick Kinnison, the individual. That will\nenable each of you to get into as close touch with me as though our\ntwo minds were one. I am not talking now; you are reading my mind.\nSince you are reading my very mind, you know exactly what I am _really_\nthinking, for better or for worse. It is impossible for my mind to\nlie to yours, since I can change neither the basic pattern of my\npersonality nor my basic way of thought; nor would I if I could. Being\nin my mind, you know that already; you know what my basic quality is.\nMy friends call it strength and courage; Pirate Chief Morgan and his\ncut-throat crew call it many other things. Be that as it may, you now\nknow whether or not you want me for your President. I can do nothing\nwhatever to sway your opinion, for what your minds have perceived you\nknow to be the truth. That is the way the Lens works. It bares the\ndepths of my mind to yours, and in return enables me to understand your\nthoughts.\n\n\"But it is in no sense hypnotism, as Morgan is so foolishly trying to\nmake you believe. Morgan knows as well as the rest of us do that even\nthe most accomplished hypnotist, with all his apparatus, CAN NOT AFFECT\nA STRONG AND DEFINITELY OPPOSED WILL. He is therefore saying that each\nand every one of you now receiving this thought is such a spineless\nweakling that--but you may draw your own conclusions.\n\n\"In closing, remember--nail this fact down so solidly that you will\nnever forget it--a sound and healthy mind CAN NOT LIE. The mouth can,\nand does. So does the typewriter. But the mind--NEVER! I can hide\nmy thoughts from you, even while we are en rapport, like this ...\nbut I CAN NOT LIE TO YOU. That is why, some day, all of your highest\nexecutives will have to be Lensmen, and not politicians, diplomats,\ncrooks and boodlers. I thank you.\"\n\nAs that long, bitter, incredibly vicious campaign neared its vitriolic\nend tension mounted higher and ever higher: and in a room in the Samms\nhome three young Lensmen and a red-haired girl were not at ease. All\nfour were lean and drawn. Jack Kinnison was talking.\n\n\"... not the party, so much, but Dad. He started out with bare fists,\nand now he's wading into 'em with spiked brass knuckles.\"\n\n\"You can play _that_ across the board,\" Costigan agreed.\n\n\"He's really giving 'em hell,\" Northrop said, admiringly.\n\n\"Did you boys listen in on his Casper speech last night?\"\n\nThey hadn't; they had been too busy.\n\n\"I could give it to you on your Lenses, but I couldn't reproduce the\ntone--the exquisite way he lifted large pieces of hide and rubbed\nsalt into the raw places. When he gets excited you know he can't help\nbut use voice, too, so I got some of it on a record. He starts out\non voice, nice and easy, as usual; then goes onto his Lens without\ntalking; then starts yelling as well as thinking. Listen:\"\n\n\"You ought to have a Lensman president. You may not believe that any\nLensman is, and as a matter of fact _must_ be incorruptible. That is\nmy belief, as you can feel for yourselves, but I cannot _prove_ it to\nyou. Only time can do that. It is a self-evident fact, however, which\nyou can feel for yourselves, that a Lensman president could not lie to\nyou except by word of mouth or in writing. You could demand from him\nat any time a Lensed statement upon any subject. Upon some matters of\nstate he could and should refuse to answer; but not upon any question\ninvolving moral turpitude. If he answered, you would know the truth. If\nhe refused to answer, you would know why and could initiate impeachment\nproceedings then and there.\n\n\"In the past there have been presidents who used that high office for\nlow purposes; whose very memory reeks of malfeasance and corruption.\nOne was impeached, others should have been. Witherspoon never should\nhave been elected. Witherspoon should have been impeached the day after\nhe was inaugurated. Witherspoon should be impeached now. We know, and\nat the Grand Rally at New York Spaceport three weeks from tonight\nwe are going to PROVE, that Witherspoon is simply a minor cog-wheel\nin the Morgan-Towne-Isaacson machine, 'playing footsie' at command\nwith whatever group happens to be the highest bidder at the moment,\nirrespective of North America's or the System's good. Witherspoon is a\ngangster, a cheat, and a God damn liar, but he is of very little actual\nimportance; merely a boodling nincompoop. Morgan is the real boss and\nthe real menace, the Operating Engineer of the lowest-down, lousiest,\nfilthiest, rottenest, most corrupt machine of murderers, extortionists,\nbribe-takers, panderers, perjurers, and other pimples on the body\npolitic that has ever disgraced any so-called civilized government.\nGood night.\"\n\n\"Wow!\" Jack Kinnison yelped. \"That's high, even for him!\"\n\n\"Just a minute, Jack,\" Jill cautioned. \"The other side, too. Listen to\nthis choice bit from Senator Morgan.\"\n\n\"It is not exactly hypnotism, but something infinitely worse; something\nthat steals away your very minds; that makes anyone listening believe\nthat white is yellow, red, purple, or pea-green. Until our scientists\nhave checked this menace, until we have every wearer of that cursed\nLens behind steel bars, I advise you in all earnestness not to listen\nto them at all. If you do listen your minds will surely be insidiously\ndecomposed and broken; you will surely end your days gibbering in a\npadded cell.\n\n\"And murders? _Murders!_ The feeble remnants of the gangs which our\ngovernment has all but wiped out may perhaps commit a murder or so per\nyear; the perpetrators of which are caught, tried, and punished. But\nhow many of your sons and daughters has Roderick Kinnison murdered,\neither personally or through his uniformed slaves? Think! Read the\nrecord! Then make him explain, if he can; but do not listen to his\nlying, mind-destroying Lens.\n\n\"Democracy? Bah! What does 'Rod the Rock' Kinnison--the hardest, most\nvicious tyrant, the most relentless and pitiless martinet ever known to\nany Armed Force in the long history of our world--know of democracy?\nNothing! He understands only force. All who oppose him in anything,\nhowever small, or who seek to reason with him, die without record or\ntrace; and if he is not arrested, tried, and executed, all such will\ncontinue, tracelessly and without any pretense of trial, to die.\n\n\"But at bottom, even though he is not intelligent enough to realize\nit, he is merely one more in the long parade of tools of ruthless\nand predatory wealth, the MONIED POWERS. _They_, my friends, never\nsleep; they have only one God, one tenet, one creed--the almighty\nCREDIT. _That_ is what they are after, and note how craftily, how\nstealthily, they have done and are doing their grabbing. Where is\nyour representation upon that so-called Galactic Council? How did\nthis criminal, this vicious, this outrageously unconstitutional, this\nirresponsible, uncontrollable, and dictatorial monstrosity come into\nbeing? How and when did you give this bloated colossus the right to\nestablish its own currency--to have the immeasurable effrontery to\ndebar the solidest currency in the universe, the credit of North\nAmerica, from inter-planetary and inter-stellar commerce? Their aim is\nclear; they intend to tax you into slavery and death. Do not forget for\none instant, my friends, that the power to tax is the power to destroy.\nTHE POWER TO TAX IS THE POWER TO DESTROY. Our forefathers fought and\nbled and died to establish the principle that taxation without rep....\"\n\n\"And so on, for one solid hour!\" Jill snarled, as she snapped the\nswitch viciously. \"How do you like _them_ potatoes?\"\n\n\"Hell's--Blazing--Pinnacles!\" This from Jack, silent for seconds, and:\n\n\"Rugged stuff ... very, _very_ rugged,\" from Northrop. \"No wonder you\nlook sort of pooped, Spud. Being Chief Bodyguard must have developed\nrecently into quite a chore.\"\n\n\"You ain't just snapping your choppers, bub,\" was Costigan's grimly\nflippant reply. \"I've yelled for help--in force.\"\n\n\"So have I, and I'm going to yell again, right now,\" Jack declared. \"I\ndon't know whether Dad is going to kill Morgan or not--and don't give\na damn--but if Morgan isn't going all out to kill Dad it's because\nthey've forgotten how to make bombs.\"\n\nHe Lensed a call to Bergenholm.\n\n\"Yes, Jack?... I will refer you to Rularion, who has had this matter\nunder consideration.\"\n\n\"Yes, John Kinnison, I have considered the matter and have taken\naction,\" the Jovian's calmly assured thought rolled into the minds of\nall, even Lensless Jill's. \"The point, youth, was well taken. It was\nyour thought that some thousands--perhaps five--of spy-ray operators\nand other operatives will be required to insure that the Grand Rally\nwill not be marred by episodes of violence.\"\n\n\"It was,\" Jack said, flatly. \"It still is.\"\n\n\"Not having considered all possible contingencies nor the extent of\nthe field of necessary action, you err. The number will approach\nnineteen thousand very nearly. Admiral Clayton has been so advised and\nhis staff is now at work upon a plan of action in accordance with my\nrecommendation. Your suggestions, Conway Costigan, in the matter of\nimmediate protection of Roderick Kinnison's person, are now in effect,\nand you are hereby relieved of that responsibility. I assume that you\nfour wish to continue at work?\"\n\nThe Jovian's assumption was sound.\n\n\"I suggest, then, that you confer with Admiral Clayton and fit\nyourselves into his program of security. I intend to make the same\nsuggestion to all Lensmen and other qualified persons not engaged in\nwork of more pressing importance.\"\n\nRularion cut off and Jack scowled blackly. \"The Grand Rally is going to\nbe held three weeks before election day. I _still_ don't like it. I'd\nsave it until the night before election--knock their teeth out with it\nat the last possible minute.\"\n\n\"You're wrong, Jack; the Chief is right,\" Costigan argued. \"Two ways.\nOne, we can't play that kind of ball. Two, this gives them just enough\nrope to hang themselves.\"\n\n\"Well ... maybe.\" Kinnison-like, Jack was far from being convinced.\n\"But that's the way it's going to be, so let's call Clayton.\"\n\n\"First,\" Costigan broke in. \"Jill, will you please explain why they\nhave to waste as big a man as Kinnison on such a piffling job as\npresident? I was out in the sticks, you know--it doesn't make sense.\"\n\n\"Because he's the only man alive who can lick Morgan's machine at the\npolls,\" Jill stated a simple fact. \"The Patrol can get along without\nhim for one term, after that it won't make any difference.\"\n\n\"But Morgan works from the side-lines. Why couldn't he?\"\n\n\"The psychology is entirely different. Morgan _is_ a boss. Pops\nKinnison isn't. He's a leader. See?\"\n\n\"Oh ... I guess so.... Yes. Go ahead.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOutwardly, New York Spaceport did not change appreciably. At any\ngiven moment of day or night there were so many hundreds of persons\nstrolling aimlessly or walking purposefully about that an extra hundred\nor so made no perceptible difference. And the spaceport was only the\nend-point. The Patrol's activities began hundreds or thousands or\nmillions or billions of miles away from Earth's metropolis.\n\nA web was set up through which not even a grain-of-sand meteorite could\npass undetected. Every space-ship bound for Earth carried at least one\npassenger who would not otherwise have been aboard; passengers who, if\nnot wearing Lenses, carried Service Special equipment amply sufficient\nfor the work in hand. Geigers and other vastly more complicated\nmechanisms flew toward Earth from every direction in space; streamed\ntoward New York in Earth's every channel of traffic. Every train and\nplane, every bus and boat and car, every conveyance of every kind and\nevery pedestrian approaching New York City was searched; with a search\nas thorough as it was unobtrusive. And every thing and every entity\napproaching New York Spaceport was combed, literally by the cubic\nmillimeter.\n\nNo arrests were made. No package was confiscated, or even disturbed,\nthroughout the ranks of public check boxes, in private offices, or\nin elaborate or casual hiding-places. As far as the enemy knew, the\nPatrol had no suspicion whatever that anything out of the ordinary was\ngoing on. That is, until the last possible minute. Then a tall, lean,\nspace-tanned veteran spoke softly aloud, as though to himself:\n\n\"Spy-ray blocks--interference--umbrella--on. Report.\"\n\nThat voice, low and soft as it was, was picked up by every Service\nSpecial receiver within a radius of a thousand miles, and by every\nLensman listening, wherever he might be. So were, in a matter of\nseconds, the replies.\n\n\"Spy-ray blocks on, sir.\"\n\n\"Interference on, sir.\"\n\n\"Umbrella on, sir.\"\n\nNo spy-ray could be driven into any part of the tremendous port. No\nbeam, communicator or detonating, could operate anywhere near it. The\nenemy would now know that something had gone wrong, but he would not be\nable to do anything about it.\n\n\"Reports received,\" the tanned man said, still quietly. \"Operation Zunk\nwill proceed as scheduled.\"\n\nAnd four hundred seventy one highly skilled men, carrying duplicate\nkeys and/or whatever other specialized apparatus and equipment would be\nnecessary, quietly took possession of four hundred seventy one objects,\nof almost that many shapes and sizes. And, out in the gathering crowd,\na few disturbances occurred and a few ambulances dashed busily here and\nthere. Some women had fainted, no doubt, ran the report. They always\ndid.\n\nAnd Conway Costigan, who had been watching, without seeming even to\nlook at him, a porter loading a truck with opulent-looking hand-luggage\nfrom a locker, followed man and truck out into the concourse. Closing\nup, he asked:\n\n\"Where are you taking that baggage, Charley?\"\n\n\"Up Ramp One, boss,\" came the unflurried reply. \"Flight Ninety will be\nlate taking off, on accounta this jamboree, and they want it right up\nthere handy.\"\n\n\"Take it down to the....\"\n\nOver the years a good many men had tried to catch Conway Costigan off\nguard or napping, to beat him to the punch or to the draw--with a\nstartlingly uniform lack of success. The Lensman's fist traveled a bare\nseven inches: the supposed porter gasped once and traveled--or rather,\nstaggered backward--approximately seven feet before he collapsed and\nsprawled unconscious upon the pavement.\n\n\"Decontamination,\" Costigan remarked, apparently to empty air, as\nhe picked the fellow up and draped him limply over the truckful\nof suitcases. \"Deke. Front and center. Area forty-six. Class\nEff-ex--hotter than the middle tailrace of hell.\"\n\n\"You called Deke?\" A man came running up. \"Eff-ex six--nineteen. This\nit?\"\n\n\"Check. It's yours, porter and all. Take it away.\"\n\nCostigan strolled on until he met Jack Kinnison, who had a\nrapidly-developing mouse under his left eye.\n\n\"How did _that_ happen, Jack?\" he demanded sharply. \"Something slip?\"\n\n\"Not exactly.\" Kinnison grinned ruefully. \"I have the _damndest_ luck!\nA woman--an old lady at that--thought I was staging a hold-up and swung\non me with her hand-bag--southpaw and from the rear. And if you laugh,\nyou untuneful harp, I'll hang one right on the end of your chin, so\nhelp me!\"\n\n\"Far be it from such,\" Costigan assured him, and did not--quite--laugh.\n\"Wonder how we came out? They should have reported before\nthis--p-s-s-t! Here it comes!\"\n\nDecontamination was complete; Operation Zunk had been a\none-hundred-percent success; there had been no casualties.\n\n\"Except for one black eye,\" Costigan could not help adding; but his\nLens and his Service Specials were off. Jack would have brained him if\nany of them had been on.\n\nLinking arms, the two young Lensmen strode away toward Ramp Four, which\nwas to be their station.\n\nThis was the largest crowd Earth had ever known. Everybody,\nparticularly the Nationalists, had wondered why this climactic\npolitical rally had been set for three full weeks ahead of the\nelection, but their curiosity had not been satisfied. Furthermore, this\nmeeting had been advertised as no previous one had ever been; neither\npains nor cash had been spared in giving it the greatest build-up ever\nknown. Not only had every channel of communication been loaded for\nweeks, but also Samms' workers had been very busily engaged in starting\nrumors; which grew, as rumors do, into things which their own fathers\nand mothers could not recognize. And the baffled Nationalists, trying\nto play the whole thing down, made matters worse. Interest spread from\nNorth America to the other continents, to the other planets, and to the\nother solar systems.\n\nThus, to say that everybody was interested in, and was listening to,\nthe Cosmocrats' Grand Rally would not be too serious an exaggeration.\n\nRoderick Kinnison stepped up to the battery of microphones; certain\nscreens were cut.\n\n\"Fellow entities of Civilization and others: while it may seem strange\nto broadcast a political rally to other continents and to beam it to\nother worlds, it was necessary in this case. The message to be given,\nwhile it will go into the political affairs of the North American\nContinent of Tellus, will deal primarily with a far larger thing; a\nmatter which will be of paramount importance to all intelligent beings\nof every inhabited world. You know how to attune your minds to mine. Do\nit now.\"\n\nHe staggered mentally under the shock of encountering practically\nsimultaneously so many minds, but rallied strongly and went on, via\nLens:\n\n\"My first message is not to you, my fellow Cosmocrats, nor to you,\nmy fellow dwellers on Earth, nor even to you, my fellow adherents to\nCivilization; but to THE ENEMY. I do not mean my political opponents,\nthe Nationalists, who are almost all loyal fellow North Americans. I\nmean the entities who are using the leaders of that Nationalist party\nas pawns in a vastly larger game.\n\n\"I know, ENEMY, that you are listening. I know that you had goon\nsquads in this audience, to kill me and my superior officer. Know\nnow that they are impotent. I know that you had atomic bombs, with\nwhich to obliterate this assemblage and this entire area. They have\nbeen disassembled and stored. I know that you had large supplies of\nradio-active dusts. They now lie in the Patrol vaults near Weehauken.\nAll the devices which you intended to employ are known, and all save\none have been either nullified or confiscated.\n\n\"That one exception is your war-fleet, a force sufficient in your\nopinion to wipe out all the Armed Forces of the Galactic Patrol. You\nintended to use it in case we Cosmocrats win this forthcoming election;\nyou may decide to use it now. Do so if you like; you can do nothing to\ninterrupt or to affect this meeting. This is all I have to say to you,\nEnemy of Civilization.\n\n\"Now to you, my legitimate audience. I am not here to deliver the\naddress promised you, but merely to introduce the real speaker--First\nLensman Virgil Samms....\"\n\nA mental gasp, millions strong, made itself tellingly felt.\n\n\"... Yes--First Lensman Samms, of whom you all know. He has not been\nattending political meetings because we, his advisers, would not\nlet him. Why? Here are the facts. Through Archibald Isaacson, of\nInterstellar Spaceways, he was offered a bribe which would in a few\nyears have amounted to some fifty billion credits; more wealth than\nany individual entity has ever possessed. Then there was an attempt at\nmurder, which we were able--just barely--to block. Knowing there was no\nother place on Earth where he would be safe, we took him to The Hill.\nYou know what happened; you know what condition The Hill is in now.\nThis warfare was ascribed to pirates.\n\n\"The whole stupendous operation, however, was made in a vain attempt to\nkill one man--Virgil Samms. The Enemy knew, and we learned, that Samms\nis the greatest man who has ever lived. His name will last as long as\nCivilization endures, for it is he, and _only_ he, who can make it\npossible for Civilization _to_ endure.\n\n\"Why was I not killed? Why was I allowed to keep on making campaign\nspeeches? Because I do not count. I am of no more importance to the\ncause of Civilization than is my opponent Witherspoon to that of the\nEnemy.\n\n\"I am a wheel-horse, a plugger. You all know me--'Rocky Rod' Kinnison,\nthe hard-boiled egg. I've got guts enough to stand up and fight for\nwhat I _know_ is right. I've got the guts and the inclination to stand\nup and slug it out, toe to toe, with man, beast, or devil. I would make\nand WILL MAKE a good president; I've got the guts and inclination to\nkeep on slugging after you elect me; before God I promise to smash down\nevery machine-made crook who tries to hold any part of our government\ndown in the reeking muck in which it now is.\n\n\"I am a plugger and a slugger, with no spark of the terrific flame of\ninspirational genius which makes Virgil Samms what he so uniquely is.\nMy _kind_ may be important, but I individually am not. There are _so_\nmany of us! If they had killed me another slugger would have taken my\nplace and the effect upon the job would have been nil.\n\n\"Virgil Samms, however, _can not be replaced_ and the Enemy knows\nit. He is unique in all history. No one else can do his job. If he\nis killed before the principles for which he is working are firmly\nestablished Civilization will collapse back into barbarism. It will not\nrecover until another such mind comes into existence, the probability\nof which occurrence I will let you compute for yourselves.\n\n\"For those reasons Virgil Samms is not here in person. Nor is he in\nThe Hill, since the Enemy may now possess weapons powerful enough to\ndestroy not only that hitherto impregnable fortress, but also the whole\nEarth. And they would destroy Earth, without a qualm, if in so doing\nthey could kill the First Lensman.\n\n\"Therefore Samms is now out in deep space. Our fleet is waiting to\nbe attacked. If we win, the Galactic Patrol will go on. If we lose,\nwe hope you shall have learned enough so that we will not have died\nuselessly.\"\n\n\"Die? Why should _you_ die? _You_ are safe on Earth!\"\n\n\"Ah, one of the goons sent that thought. If our fleet is defeated no\nLensman, anywhere, will live a week. The Enemy will see to that.\n\n\"That is all from me. Stay tuned. Come in, First Lensman Virgil\nSamms ... take over, sir.\"\n\nIt was psychologically impossible for Virgil Samms to use such language\nas Kinnison had just employed. Nor was it either necessary or desirable\nthat he should; the ground had been prepared. Therefore--coldly,\nimpersonally, logically, tellingly--he told the whole terrific\nstory. He revealed the most important things dug up by the Patrols'\nindefatigable investigators, reciting names, places, dates,\ntransactions, and amounts. Only in the last couple of minutes did he\nwarm up at all.\n\n\"Nor is this in any sense a smear campaign or a bringing of baseless\ncharges to becloud the issue or to vilify without cause and upon the\nvery eve of election a political opponent. These are facts. Formal\ncharges are now being preferred; every person mentioned, and many\nothers, will be put under arrest as soon as possible. If any one of\nthem were in any degree innocent our case against him could be made to\nfall in less than the three weeks intervening before election day. That\nis why this meeting is being held at this time.\n\n\"Not one of them is innocent.

You will know how to cast your\nvotes. You will vote for Roderick Kinnison and for those who support\nhim.\n\n\"There is no need for me to enlarge upon the character of Port Admiral\nKinnison. You know him as well as I do. Honest, incorruptible,\nfearless, you know that he will make the best president we have ever\nhad.

With the formation of the Galactic\nPatrol, however, and their becoming Admiral and Lieutenant-Admiral of\nthe First Galactic Region, and their acquisition of Lenses, the radius\nof their sphere of action was tremendously increased. One or the other\nof them was always to be found in Grand Fleet Headquarters at New\nYork Spaceport, but only very seldom were both of them there at once.\nAnd if the absentee were not to be found on Earth, what of it? The\nFirst Galactic Region included all of the solar systems and all of the\nplanets adherent to Civilization, and the absentee could, as a matter\nof business and duty, be practically anywhere.\n\nUsually, however, he was not upon any of the generally-known planets,\nbut upon Bennett--getting acquainted with the officers, supervising\nthe drilling of Grand Fleet in new maneuvers, teaching classes in\nadvanced strategy, and holding skull-practice generally. It was hard\nwork, and not too inspiring, but in the end it paid off big. They knew\ntheir men; their men knew them. They could work together with a snap, a\nsmoothness, a precision otherwise impossible; for imported top brass,\nunknown to and unacquainted with the body of command, can not have and\ndoes not expect the deep regard and the earned respect so necessary to\nhigh morale.\n\nClayton and Schweikert had both. They started early enough, worked\nhard enough, and had enough stuff, to earn both. Thus it came about\nthat when, upon a scheduled day, the two admirals came to Bennett\ntogether, they were greeted as enthusiastically as though they had\nbeen Bennettans born and bred; and their welcome became a planet-wide\ncelebration when Clayton issued the orders which all Bennett had been\nwaiting so long and so impatiently to hear. Bennettans were at last to\nleave Bennett!\n\nGroup after group, sub-fleet after sub-fleet, the component units of\nthe Galactic Patrol's Grand Fleet took off. They assembled in space;\nthey maneuvered enough to shake themselves down into some semblance of\nunity; they practiced the new maneuvers; they blasted off in formation\nfor Sol. And as the tremendous armada neared the Solar System it\nmet--or, rather, was joined by--the Patrol ships about which Morgan\nand his minions already knew; each of which fitted itself into its\nlong-assigned place. Every planet of Civilization had sent its every\nvessel capable of putting out a screen or of throwing a beam, but so\nimmense was the number of warships in Grand Fleet that this increment,\ngreat as it intrinsically was, made no perceptible difference in its\nsize.\n\nOn Rally Day Grand Fleet lay poised near Earth. As soon as he had\nintroduced Samms to the intensely interested listeners at the Rally,\nRoderick Kinnison disappeared. Actually, he drove a bug to a distant\ncorner of the spaceport and left the Earth in a light cruiser, but to\nall intents and purposes, so engrossed was everyone in what Samms was\nsaying, Kinnison simply vanished. Samms was already in the _Boise_; the\nPort Admiral went out to his old flagship, the _Chicago_. Nor, in case\nany observer of the Enemy should be trying to keep track of him, could\nhis course be traced. Cleveland and Northrop and Rularion and all they\nneeded of the vast resources of the Patrol saw to that.\n\nNeither Samms nor Kinnison had any business being with Grand Fleet in\nperson, of course, and both knew it; but everyone knew why they were\nthere and were glad that the two top Lensmen had decided to live or\ndie with their Fleet. If Grand Fleet won, they would probably live; if\nGrand Fleet lost they would certainly die--if not in the pyrotechnic\ndissolution of their ships, then in a matter of days upon the ground.\nWith the Fleet their presence would contribute markedly to morale. It\nwas a chance very much worth taking.\n\nNor were Clayton and Schweikert together, or even near each other.\nSamms, Kinnison, and the two admirals were as far away from each other\nas they could get and still remain in Grand Fleet's fighting cylinder.\n\nCylinder? Yes. The Patrol's Board of Strategy, assuming that the enemy\nwould attack in conventional cone formation and knowing that one cone\ncould defeat another only after a long and costly engagement, had long\nsince spent months and months at war-games in their tactical tanks,\nin search of a better formation. They had found it. Theoretically,\na cylinder of proper composition could defeat, with negligible loss\nand in a very short time, the best cones they were able to devise.\nThe drawback was that the ships composing a theoretically efficient\ncylinder would have to be highly specialized and vastly greater in\nnumber than any one power had ever been able to put into the ether.\nHowever, with all the resources of Bennett devoted to construction,\nthis difficulty would not be insuperable.\n\nThis, of course, brought up the question of what would happen if\ncylinder met cylinder--if the Black strategists should also have\narrived at the same solution--and this question remained unanswered.\nOr, rather, there were too many answers, no two of which agreed; like\nthose to the classical one of what would happen if an irresistible\nforce should strike an immovable object. There would be a lot of\nintensely interesting by-products!\n\nEven Rularion of Jove did not come up with a definite solution.\nNor did Bergenholm; who, although a comparatively obscure young\nLensman-scientist and not a member of the Galactic Council, was\nfrequently called into consultation because of his unique ability to\narrive at correct conclusions via some obscurely short-circuiting\nprocess of thought.\n\n\"Well,\" Port Admiral Kinnison had concluded, finally, \"_If_ they've got\none, too, we'll just have to shorten ours up, widen it out, and pray.\"\n\n\"Clayton to Port Admiral Kinnison,\" came a communication through\nchannels. \"Have you any additional orders or instructions?\"\n\n\"Kinnison to Admiral Clayton. None,\" the Port Admiral replied, as\nformally, then went on via Lens: \"No comment or criticism to make,\nAlex. You fellows have done a job so far and you'll keep on doing one.\nHow much detection have you got out?\"\n\n\"Twelve detets--three globes of diesels. If we sit here and do nothing\nthe boys will get edgy and go stale, so if you and Virge agree we'll\ngive 'em some practice. Lord knows they need it, and it'll keep 'em on\ntheir toes. But about the Blacks--they may be figuring on delaying any\naction until we've had time to crack from boredom. What's your idea on\nthat?\"\n\n\"I've been worried about the same thing. Practice will help, but\nwhether enough or not I don't know. What do you think, Virge? Will they\nhold it up deliberately or strike fast?\"\n\n\"Fast,\" the First Lensman replied, promptly and definitely. \"As soon\nas they possibly can, for several reasons. They don't know our real\nstrength, any more than we know theirs. They undoubtedly believe,\nhowever, the same as we do, that they are more efficient than we are\nand have the larger force. By their own need of practice they will know\nours. They do not attach nearly as much importance to morale as we do;\nby the very nature of their regime they can't. Also, our open challenge\nwill tend very definitely to force their hands, since face-saving is\neven more important to them than it is to us. They will strike as soon\nas they can and as hard as they can.\"\n\nGrand Fleet maneuvers were begun, but in a day or so the alarms came\nblasting in. The enemy had been detected; coming in, as the previous\nBlack Fleet had come, from the direction of Coma Berenices. Calculating\nmachines clicked and whirred; orders were flashed, and a brief string\nof numbers; ships by the hundreds and the thousands flashed into their\nassigned positions.\n\nOr, more precisely, _almost_ into them. Most of the navigators and\npilots had not had enough practice yet to hit their assigned positions\nexactly on the first try, since a radical change in axial direction\nwas involved, but they did pretty well; a few minutes of juggling and\njockeying were enough. Clayton and Schweikert used a little caustic\nlanguage--via Lens and to their fellow Lensmen only, of course--but\nSamms and Kinnison were well enough pleased. The time of formation had\nbeen very satisfactorily short and the cone was smooth, symmetrical,\nand of beautifully uniform density.\n\nThe preliminary formation was a cone, not a cylinder. It was not a\nconventional Cone of Battle in that it was not of standard composition,\nwas too big, and had altogether too many ships for its size. It was,\nhowever, of the conventional shape, and it was believed that by the\ntime the enemy could perceive any significant differences it would be\ntoo late for him to do anything about it. The cylinder would be forming\nabout that time, anyway, and it was almost believed--at least it was\nstrongly hoped--that the enemy would not have the time or the knowledge\nor the equipment to do anything about that, either.\n\nKinnison grinned to himself as his mind, en rapport with Clayton's,\nwatched the enemy's Cone of Battle enlarge upon the Admiral's conning\nplate. It was big, and powerful; the Galactic Patrol's publicly-known\nforces would have stood exactly the chance of the proverbial snowball\nin the nether regions. It was not, however, the Port Admiral thought,\nbig enough to form an efficient cylinder, or to handle the Patrol's\nreal force in any fashion--and unless they shifted within the next\nsecond or two it would be too late for the enemy to do anything at all.\n\nAs though by magic about ninety-five percent of the Patrol's tremendous\ncone changed into a tightly-packed double cylinder. This maneuver\nwas much simpler than the previous one, and had been practiced to\nperfection. The mouth of the cone closed in and lengthened; the closed\nend opened out and shortened. Tractors and pressors leaped from ship to\nship, binding the whole myriad of hitherto discrete units into a single\nstructure as solid, even comparatively as to size, as a cantilever\nbridge. And instead of remaining quiescent, waiting to be attacked, the\ncylinder flashed forward, inertialess, at maximum blast.\n\nThroughout the years the violence, intensity, and sheer brute power of\noffensive weapons had increased steadily. Defensive armament had kept\nstep. One fundamental fact, however, had not changed throughout the\nages and has not changed yet. Three or more units of given power have\nalways been able to conquer one unit of the same power, if engagement\ncould be forced and no assistance could be given; and two units could\npractically always do so. Fundamentally, therefore, strategy always\nhas been and still is the development of new artifices and techniques\nby virtue of which two or more of our units may attack one of theirs;\nthe while affording the minimum of opportunity for them to retaliate in\nkind.\n\nThe Patrol's Grand Fleet flashed forward, almost exactly along the axis\nof the Black cone; right where the enemy wanted it--or so he thought.\nStraight into the yawning mouth, erupting now a blast of flame beside\nwhich the wildest imaginings of Inferno must pale into insignificance;\nstraight along that raging axis toward the apex, at the terrific speed\nof the two directly opposed velocities of flight. But, to the complete\nconsternation of the Black High Command, nothing much happened. For,\nas has been pointed out, that cylinder was not of even approximately\nnormal composition. In fact, there was not a normal war-vessel in it.\nThe outer skin and both ends of the cylinder were purely defensive.\nThose vessels, packed so closely that their repellor fields actually\ntouched, were all screen; none of them had a beam hot enough to light a\nmatch. Conversely, the inner layer, or \"Liner\", was composed of vessels\nthat were practically all offense. They had to be protected at every\npoint--but how they could ladle it out!\n\nThe leading and trailing edges of the formation--the ends of the\ngigantic pipe, so to speak--would of course bear the brunt of the\nBlack attack, and it was this factor that had given the Patrol's\nstrategists the most serious concern. Wherefore the first ten and\nthe last six double rings of ships were special indeed. They were\n_all_ screen--nothing else. They were drones, operated by remote\ncontrol, carrying no living thing. If the Patrol losses could be held\nto eight double rings of ships at the first pass and four at the\nsecond--theoretical computations indicated losses of six and two--Samms\nand his fellows would be well content.\n\nAll of the Patrol ships had, of course, the standard equipment\nof so-called \"violet\", \"green\", and \"red\" fields, as well as\nduodecaplylatomate and ordinary atomic bombs, dirigible torpedoes\nand transporters, slicers, polycyclic drills, and so on; but in this\nbattle the principal reliance was to be placed upon the sheer, brutal,\noverwhelming power of what had been called the \"macro beam\"--now\nsimply the \"beam\". Furthermore, in the incredibly incandescent frenzy\nof the chosen field of action--the cylinder was to attack the cone\nat its very strongest part--no conceivable material projectile could\nhave lasted a single microsecond after leaving the screens of force\nof its parent vessel. It could have flown fast enough; ultra-beam\ntrackers could have steered it rapidly enough and accurately enough;\nbut before it could have traveled a foot, even at ultra-light speed,\nit would have ceased utterly to be. It would have been resolved into\nits sub-atomic constituent particles and waves. Nothing material could\nexist, except instantaneously, in the field of force filling the axis\nof the Black's Cone of Battle; a field beside which the exact center of\na multi-billion-volt flash of lightning would constitute a dead area.\n\nThat field, however, encountered no material object. The Patrol's\n\"screeners\", packed so closely as to have a four hundred percent\noverlap, had been designed to withstand precisely that inconceivable\nenvironment. Practically all of them withstood it. And in a fraction of\na second the hollow forward end of the cylinder engulfed, pipe-wise,\nthe entire apex of the enemy's war-cone, and the hitherto idle\n\"sluggers\" of the cylinder's liner went to work.\n\nEach of those vessels had one heavy pressor beam, each having the same\npush as every other, directed inward, toward the cylinder's axis, and\nbackward at an angle of fifteen degrees from the perpendicular line\nbetween ship and axis. Therefore, wherever any Black ship entered the\nPatrol's cylinder or however, it was driven to and held at the axis and\nforced backward along that axis. None of them, however, got very far.\nThey were perforce in single file; one ship opposing at least one solid\nring of giant sluggers who did not have to concern themselves with\ndefense, but could pour every iota of their tremendous resources into\noffensive beams. Thus the odds were not merely two or three to one; but\nnever less than eighty, and very frequently over two hundred to one.\n\nUnder the impact of those unimaginable torrents of force the screens of\nthe engulfed vessels flashed once, practically instantaneously through\nthe spectrum, and went down. Whether they had two or three or four\ncourses made no difference--in fact, even the ultra-speed analyzers of\nthe observers could not tell. Then, a couple of microseconds later,\nthe wall-shields--the strongest fabrics of force developed by man up\nto that time--also failed. Then those ravenous fields of force struck\nbare, unprotected metal, and every molecule, inorganic and organic, of\nships and contents alike, disappeared in a bursting flare of energy so\nraw and so violent as to stagger even those who had brought it into\nexistence. It was certainly vastly more than a mere volatilization; it\nwas deduced later that the detonating unstable isotopes of the Black's\nown bombs, in the frightful temperatures already existing in the\nPatrol's quasi-solid beams, had initiated a chain reaction which had\nresulted in the fissioning of a considerable proportion of the atomic\nnuclei of usually completely stable elements!\n\nThe cylinder stopped; the Lensmen took stock. The depth of erosion\nof the leading edge had averaged almost exactly six double rings of\ndrones. In places the sixth ring was still intact; in others, which had\nencountered unusually concentrated beaming, the seventh was gone. Also,\na fraction of one percent of the manned war-vessels had disappeared.\nBrief though the time of engagement had been, the enemy had been able\nto concentrate enough beams to burn a few holes through the walls of\nthe attacking cylinder.\n\nIt had not been hoped that more than a few hundreds of Black vessels\ncould be blown out of the ether at this first pass. General Staff\nhad been sure, however, that the heaviest and most dangerous ships,\nincluding those carrying the enemy's High Command, would be among them.\nThe mid-section of the apex of the conventional Cone of Battle had\nalways been the safest place to be; therefore that was where the Black\nadmirals had been and therefore they no longer lived.\n\nIn a few seconds it became clear that if any Black High Command\nexisted, it was not in shape to function efficiently. Some of the\nenemy ships were still blasting, with little or no concerted effort,\nat the regulation cone which the cylinder had left behind; a few were\nattempting to get into some kind of a formation, possibly to attack the\nPatrol's cylinder. Indecision was visible and rampant.\n\nTo turn that tremendous cylindrical engine of destruction around would\nhave been a task of hours, but it was not necessary. Instead, each\nvessel cut its tractors and pressors, spun end for end, reconnected,\nand retraced almost exactly its previous course; cutting out and\nblasting into nothingness another \"plug\" of Black warships. Another\nreversal, another dash; and this time, so disorganized were the foes\nand so feeble the beaming, not a single Patrol vessel was lost. The\nBlack fleet, so proud and so conquering of mien a few minutes before,\nhad fallen completely apart.\n\n\"That's enough, Rod, don't you think?\" Samms thought then. \"Please\norder Clayton to cease action, so that we can hold a parley with their\nsenior officers.\"\n\n\"Parley, hell!\" Kinnison's answering thought was a snarl. \"We've got\n'em going--mop 'em up before they can pull themselves together! Parley\nbe damned!\"\n\n\"Beyond a certain point military action becomes indefensible butchery,\nof which our Galactic Patrol will never be guilty. That point has now\nbeen reached. If you do not agree with me, I'll be glad to call a\nCouncil meeting to decide which of us is right.\"\n\n\"That isn't necessary. You're right--that's one reason I'm not First\nLensman.\" The Port Admiral, fury and fire ebbing from his mind, issued\norders; the Patrol forces hung motionless in space. \"As President of\nthe Galactic Council, Virge, take over.\"\n\nSpy-rays probed and searched; a communicator beam was sent. Virgil\nSamms spoke aloud, in the lingua franca of deep space.\n\n\"Connect me, please, with the senior officer of your fleet.\"\n\nThere appeared upon Samms' plate a strong, not unhandsome face;\ndeep-stamped with the bitter hopelessness of a strong man facing\ncertain death.\n\n\"You've got us. Come on and finish us.\"\n\n\"Some such indoctrination was to be expected, but I anticipate no\ntrouble in convincing you that you have been grossly misinformed in\neverything you have been told concerning us; our aims, our ethics,\nour morals, and our standards of conduct. There are, I assume, other\nsurviving officers of your rank, although of lesser seniority?\"\n\n\"There are ten other vice-admirals, but I am in command. They will obey\nmy orders or die.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, they shall be heard. Please go inert, match our\nintrinsic velocity, and come aboard, all eleven of you. We wish to\nexplore with all of you the possibilities of a lasting peace between\nour worlds.\"\n\n\"Peace? Bah! Why lie?\" The Black commander's expression did not change.\n\"I know what you are and what you do to conquered races. We prefer\na clean, quick death in your beams to the kind you deal out in your\ntorture rooms and experimental laboratories. Come ahead--I intend to\nattack you as soon as I can make a formation.\"\n\n\"I repeat, you have been grossly, terribly, _shockingly_ misinformed.\"\nSamms' voice was quiet and steady; his eyes held those of the other.\n\"We are civilized men, not barbarians or savages. Does not the fact\nthat we ceased hostilities so soon mean anything to you?\"\n\nFor the first time the stranger's face changed subtly, and Samms\npressed the slight advantage.\n\n\"I see it does. Now if you will converse with me mind to mind....\" The\nFirst Lensman felt for the man's ego and began to tune to it, but this\nwas too much.\n\n\"I will not!\" The Black put up a solid block. \"I will have nothing to\ndo with your cursed Lens. I know what it is and will have none of it!\"\n\n\"Oh, what's the use, Virge!\" Kinnison snapped. \"Let's get on with it!\"\n\n\"A great deal of use, Rod,\" Samms replied, quietly. \"This is a\nturning-point. I _must_ be right--I _can't_ be that far wrong,\" and he\nagain turned his attention to the enemy commander.\n\n\"Very well, sir, we will continue to use spoken language. I repeat,\nplease come aboard with your ten fellow vice-admirals. You will not be\nasked to surrender. You will retain your side-arms--as long as you make\nno attempt to use them. Whether or not we come to any agreement, you\nwill be allowed to return unharmed to your vessels before the battle is\nresumed.\"\n\n\"What? Side-arms? Returned? You swear it?\"\n\n\"As President of the Galactic Council, in the presence of the highest\nofficers of the Galactic Patrol as witnesses, I swear it.\"\n\n\"We will come aboard.\"\n\n\"Very well. I will have ten other Lensmen and officers here with me.\"\n\nThe _Boise_, of course, inerted first; followed by the _Chicago_ and\nnine of the tremendous tear-drops from Bennett. Port Admiral Kinnison\nand nine other Lensmen joined Samms in the _Boise's_ con room; the\ntight formation of eleven Patrol ships blasted in unison in the\nspace-courtesy of meeting the equally tight formation of Black warships\nhalf-way in the matter of intrinsic velocity.\n\nSoon the two little sub-fleets were motionless in respect to each\nother. Eleven Black gigs were launched. Eleven Black vice-admirals came\naboard, to the accompaniment of the full military honors customarily\ngranted to visiting admirals of friendly powers. Each was armed with\nwhat seemed to be an exact duplicate of the Patrol's own current\nblaster; Lewiston, Mark Seventeen. In the lead strode the tall, heavy,\ngray-haired man with whom Samms had been dealing; still defiant, still\nsullen, still concealing sternly his sheer desperation. His block was\nstill on, full strength.\n\nThe man next in line was much younger than the leader, much less\nwrought up, much more intent. Samms felt for this man's ego, tuned to\nit, and got the shock of his life. This Black vice-admiral's mind was\nnot at all what he had expected to encounter--it was, in every respect,\nof Lensman grade!\n\n\"Oh ... how? You are not speaking, and ... I see ... the Lens ... THE\nLENS!\" The stranger's mind was for seconds an utterly indescribable\nturmoil in which relief, gladness, and high anticipation struggled for\nsupremacy.\n\nIn the next few seconds, even before the visitors had reached their\nplaces at the conference table, Virgil Samms and Corander of Petrine\nexchanged thoughts which would require many thousands of words to\nexpress; only a few of which are necessary here.\n\n\"The LENS ... I have dreamed of such a thing, without hope of\nrealization or possibility. _How_ we have been misled! They are, then,\nactually available upon your world, Samms of Tellus?\"\n\n\"Not exactly, and not at all generally,\" and Samms explained as he had\nexplained so many times before. \"You will wear one sooner than you\nthink. But as to ending this warfare. You survivors are practically all\nnatives of your own world. Petrine?\"\n\n\"Not 'practically', we are Petrinos all. The 'teachers' were all in the\nCenter. Many remain upon Petrine and its neighboring worlds, but none\nremain alive here.\"\n\n\"Ohlanser, then, who assumed command, is also a Petrino? So\nhard-headed, I had assumed otherwise. He will be a stumbling-block. Is\nhe actually in supreme command?\"\n\n\"Only by and with our consent, under such astounding circumstances\nas these. He is a reactionary, of the old, die-hard, war-dog school.\nHe would ordinarily be in supreme command and would be supported by\nthe teachers if any were here; but I will challenge his authority and\ntheirs; standing upon my right to command my own fleet as I see fit. So\nwill, I think, several others. So go ahead with your meeting.\"\n\n\"Be seated, Gentlemen.\" All saluted punctiliously and sat down. \"Now,\nVice-Admiral Ohlanser....\"\n\n\"How do you, a stranger, know my name?\"\n\n\"I know many things. We have a suggestion to offer which, if you\nPetrinos will follow it, will end this warfare. First, please believe\nthat we have no designs upon your planet, nor any quarrel with any of\nits people who are not hopelessly contaminated by the ideas and the\nculture of the entities who are back of this whole movement; quite\npossibly those whom you refer to as the 'teachers'. You did not know\nwhom you were to fight, or why.\" This was a statement, with no hint of\nquestion about it.\n\n\"I see now that we did not know all the truth,\" Ohlanser admitted,\nstiffly. \"We were informed, and given proof sufficient to make\nus believe, that you were monsters from outer space--rapacious,\ninsatiable, senselessly and callously destructive to all other forms of\nintelligent life.\"\n\n\"We suspected something of the kind. Do you others agree? Vice-Admiral\nCorander?\"\n\n\"Yes. We were shown detailed and documented proofs; stereos of battles,\nin which no quarter was given. We saw system after system conquered,\nworld after world laid waste. We were made to believe that our only\nhope of continued existence was to meet you and destroy you in space;\nfor if you were allowed to reach Petrine every man, woman, and child on\nthe planet would either be killed outright or tortured to death. I see\nnow that those proofs were entirely false; completely vicious.\"\n\n\"They were. Those who spread that lying propaganda and all who support\ntheir organization must be and shall be weeded out. Petrine must be\nand shall be given her rightful place in the galactic fellowship of\nfree, independent, and cooperative worlds. So must any and all planets\nwhose peoples wish to adhere to Civilization instead of to tyranny and\ndespotism. To further these ends, we Lensmen suggest that you re-form\nyour fleet and proceed to Arisia....\"\n\n\"Arisia!\" Ohlanser did not like the idea.\n\n\"Arisia,\" Samms insisted. \"Upon leaving Arisia, knowing vastly more\nthan you do now, you will return to your home planet, where you will\ntake whatever steps you will then know to be necessary.\"\n\n\"We were told that your Lenses are hypnotic devices,\" Ohlanser sneered,\n\"designed to steal away and destroy the minds of any who listen to you.\nI believe _that_, fully. I will not go to Arisia, nor will any part of\nPetrine's Grand Fleet. I will not attack my home planet. I will not do\nbattle against my own people. This is final.\"\n\n\"I am not saying or implying that you should. But you continue to close\nyour mind to reason. How about you, Vice-Admiral Corander? And you\nothers?\"\n\nIn the momentary silence Samms put himself en rapport with the other\nofficers, and was overjoyed at what he learned.\n\n\"I do not agree with Vice-Admiral Ohlanser,\" Corander said, flatly. \"He\ncommands, not Grand Fleet, but his sub-fleet merely, as do we all. I\nwill lead my sub-fleet to Arisia.\"\n\n\"Traitor!\" Ohlanser shouted. He leaped to his feet and drew his\nblaster, but a tractor beam snatched it from his grasp before he could\nfire.\n\n\"You were allowed to wear side-arms, not to use them,\" Samms said,\nquietly. \"How many of you others agree with Corander; how many with\nOhlanser?\"\n\nAll nine voted with the younger man.\n\n\"Very well. Ohlanser, you may either accept Corander's leadership\nor leave this meeting now and take your sub-fleet directly back to\nPetrine. Decide now which you prefer to do.\"\n\n\"You mean you aren't going to kill me, even now? Or even degrade me, or\nput me under arrest?\"\n\n\"I mean exactly that. What is your decision?\"\n\n\"In that case ... I was--must have been--wrong. I will follow Corander.\"\n\n\"A wise choice. Corander, you already know what to expect; except that\nfour or five other Petrinos now in this room will help you, not only in\ndeciding what must be done upon Petrine, but also in the doing of it.\nThis meeting will adjourn.\"\n\n\"But ... no reprisals?\" Corander, in spite of his newly acquired\nknowledge, was dubious, almost dumbfounded. \"No invasion or occupation?\nNo indemnities to your Patrol, or reparations? No punishment of us, our\nmen, or our families?\"\n\n\"None.\"\n\n\"That does not square up even with ordinary military usage.\"\n\n\"I know it. It does conform, however, to the policy of the Galactic\nPatrol which is to spread throughout our island universe.\"\n\n\"You are not even sending your fleet, or heavy units of it, with us, to\nsee to it that we follow your instructions?\"\n\n\"It is not necessary. If you need any form of help you will inform us\nof your requirements via Lens, as I am conversing with you now, and\nwhatever you want will be supplied. However, I do not expect any such\ncall. You and your fellows are capable of handling the situation.\nYou will soon know the truth, and know that you know it; and when\nyour house-cleaning is done we will consider your application for\nrepresentation upon the Galactic Council. Good-bye.\"\n\nThus the Lensmen--particularly First Lensman Virgil Samms--brought\nanother sector of the galaxy under the aegis of Civilization.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 20\n\n\nAfter the Rally there were a few days during which neither Samms nor\nKinnison was on Earth. That the Cosmocrats' presidential candidate and\nthe First Lensman were both with the Fleet was not a secret; in fact,\nit was advertised. Everyone was told why they were out there, and\nalmost everyone approved.\n\nNor was their absence felt. Developments, fast and terrific, were\nslammed home. Cosmocratic spellbinders in every state of North America\nwaved the flag, pointed with pride, and viewed with alarm, in the\nvery best tradition of North American politics. But above all, there\nappeared upon every news-stand and in every book-shop of the Continent,\nat opening time of the day following Rally Day, a book of over eighteen\nhundred pages of fine print; a book the publication of which had given\nSamms himself no little concern.\n\n\"But I'm afraid of it!\" he had protested. \"_We_ know it's true; but\nthere's material on almost every page for the biggest libel and slander\nsuits in history!\"\n\n\"I know it,\" the bald and paunchy Lensman-attorney had replied. \"Fully.\nI hope they _do_ take action against us, but I'm absolutely certain\nthey won't.\"\n\n\"You hope they do?\"\n\n\"Yes. If they take the initiative they can't prevent us from presenting\nour evidence in full; and there is no court in existence, however\ncorrupt, before which we could not win. What they want and must have is\ndelay; avoidance of any issue until after the election.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Samms was convinced.\n\nThe location of the Patrol's Grand Fleet had been concealed from all\ninhabitants of the Solarian system, friends and foes alike; but the\nclimactic battle--liberating as it did energies sufficient to distort\nthe very warp and woof of the fabric of space itself--could not be\nhidden or denied, or even belittled. It was not, however, advertised or\nblazoned abroad. Then as now the newshawks wanted to know, instantly\nand via long-range communicators, vastly more than those responsible\nfor security cared to tell; then as now the latter said as little as it\nwas humanly possible to say.\n\nEveryone knew that the Patrol had won a magnificent victory; but nobody\nknew who or what the enemy had been. Since the rank and file knew it,\neveryone knew that only a fraction of the Black fleet had actually been\ndestroyed; but nobody knew where the remaining vessels went or what\nthey did. Everyone knew that about ninety five percent of the Patrol's\nastonishingly huge Grand Fleet had come from, and was on its way back\nto, the planet Bennett, and knew--since Bennettans would in a few weeks\nbe scampering gaily all over space--in general _what_ Bennett was; but\nnobody knew _why_ it was.\n\nThus, when the North American Contingent landed at New York Spaceport,\neveryone whom the newsmen could reach was literally mobbed. However,\nin accordance with the aphorism ascribed to the wise old owl, those\nwho knew the least said the most. But the Telenews ace who had once\ninterviewed both Kinnison and Samms wasted no time upon small fry. He\ninsisted on seeing the two top Lensmen, and kept on insisting until he\ndid see them.\n\n\"Nothing to say,\" Kinnison said curtly, leaving no doubt whatever that\nhe meant it. \"All talking--if any--will be done by First Lensman Samms.\"\n\n\"Now, all you millions of Telenews listeners, I am interviewing First\nLensman Samms himself. A little closer to the mike, please, First\nLensman. Now, sir, what everybody wants to know is--who are the Blacks?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"You don't know? On the Lens, sir?\"\n\n\"On the Lens. I still don't know.\"\n\n\"I see. But you have suspicions or ideas? You can guess?\"\n\n\"I can guess; but that's all it would be--a guess.\"\n\n\"And my guess, folks, is that his guess would be a very highly informed\nguess. Will you tell the public, First Lensman Samms, what your guess\nis?\"\n\n\"I will.\" If this reply astonished the newshawk, it staggered\nKinnison and the others who knew Samms best. It was, however, a\ncoldly calculated political move. \"While it will probably be several\nweeks before we can furnish detailed and unassailable proof, it is my\nconsidered opinion that the Black fleet was built and controlled by the\nMorgan-Towne-Isaacson machine. That they, all unknown to any of us,\nenticed, corrupted, and seduced a world, or several worlds, to their\nprogram of domination and enslavement. That they intended by armed\nforce to take over the Continent of North America and through it the\nwhole earth and all the other planets adherent to Civilization. That\nthey intended to hunt down and kill every Lensman, and to subvert the\nGalactic Council to their own ends. This is what you wanted?\"\n\n\"That's fine, sir--_just_ what we wanted. But just one more thing,\nsir.\" The newsman had obtained infinitely more than he had expected to\nget; yet, good newsmanlike, he wanted more. \"Just a word, if you will,\nMr. Samms, as to these trials and the White Book?\"\n\n\"I can add very little, I'm afraid, to what I have already said and\nwhat is in the book; and that little can be classed as 'I told you so'.\nWe are trying, and will continue to try, to force those criminals to\ntrial; to break up, to prohibit, an unending series of hair-splitting\ndelays. We want, and are determined to get, legal action; to make each\nof those we have accused defend himself in court and under oath. Morgan\nand his crew, however, are working desperately to avoid any action at\nall, because they know that we can and will prove every allegation we\nhave made.\"\n\nThe Telenews ace signed off, Samms and Kinnison went to their\nrespective offices, and Cosmocratic orators throughout the nation held\na field-day. They glowed and scintillated with triumph. They yelled\nthemselves hoarse, leather-lunged tub-thumpers though they were, in\npointing out the unsullied purity, the spotless perfection of their\nown party and its every candidate for office; in shuddering revulsion\nat the never-to-be-sufficiently-condemned, proved and demonstrated\nvillainy and blackguardy of the opposition.\n\nAnd the Nationalists, although they had been dealt a terrific and\nentirely unexpected blow, worked near-miracles of politics with what\nthey had. Morgan and his minions ranted and raved. They were being\njobbed. They were being crucified by the Monied Powers. All those\nallegations and charges were sheerest fabrications--false, utterly\nvicious, containing nothing whatever of truth. They, not the Patrol,\nwere trying to force a show-down; to vindicate themselves and to\nconfute those unspeakably unscrupulous Lensmen before Election Day.\nAnd they were succeeding! Why, otherwise, had not a single one of the\nthousands of accused even been arrested? Ask that lying First Lensman,\nVirgil Samms! Ask that rock-hearted, iron-headed, conscienceless\nmurderer, Roderick Kinnison! But do not, at peril of your sanity,\nsubmit your minds to their Lenses!\n\nAnd why, the reader asks, were not at least some of those named persons\narrested before Election Day? And your historian must answer frankly\nthat he does not know. He is not a lawyer. It would be of interest--to\nsome few of us--to follow in detail at least one of those days of legal\nbattling in one of the high courts of the land; to quote verbatim at\nleast a few of the many thousands of pages of transcript: but to most\nof us the technicalities involved would be boring in the extreme.\n\nBut couldn't the voters tell easily enough which side was on the\noffensive and which on the defensive? Which pressed for action and\nwhich insisted on postponement and delay? They could have, easily\nenough, if they had cared enough about the basic issues involved to\nmake the necessary mental effort, but almost everyone was too busy\ndoing something else. And it was so much easier to take somebody else's\nword for it. And finally, _thinking_ is an exercise to which all too\nfew brains are accustomed.\n\nBut Morgan neither ranted nor raved nor blustered when he sat in\nconference with his faintly-blue superior, who had come storming in as\nsoon as he had learned of the crushing defeat of the Black fleet. The\nKalonian was very highly concerned; so much so that the undertone of\nhis peculiar complexion was turning slowly to a delicate shade of green.\n\n\"How did _that_ happen? How _could_ it happen? Why was I not informed\nof the Patrol's real power--how could you be guilty of such stupidity?\nNow I'll have to report to Scrwan of the Eich. He's pure, undiluted\npoison--and if word of this catastrophe ever gets up to Ploor...!!!\"\n\n\"Come down out of the stratosphere, Fernald,\" Morgan countered,\nbitingly. \"Don't try to make _me_ the goat--I won't sit still for it.\nIt happened because they could build a bigger fleet than we could. You\nwere in on that--all of it. You knew what we were doing, and approved\nit--all of it. You were as badly fooled as I was. You were not informed\nbecause I could find out nothing--I could learn no more of their\nBennett than they could of our Petrine. As to reporting, you will of\ncourse do as you please; but I would advise you not to cry too much\nbefore you're really hurt. This battle isn't over yet, my friend.\"\n\nThe Kalonian had been a badly shaken entity; it was a measure of his\nstate of mind that he did not liquidate the temerarious Tellurian then\nand there. But since Morgan was as undisturbed as ever, and as sure of\nhimself, he began to regain his wonted aplomb. His color became again\nits normal pale blue.\n\n\"I will forgive your insubordination this time, since there were no\nwitnesses, but use no more such language to me,\" he said, stiffly.\n\"I fail to perceive any basis for your optimism. The only chance now\nremaining is for you to win the election, and how can you do that? You\nare--must be--losing ground steadily and rapidly.\"\n\n\"Not as much as you might think.\" Morgan pulled down a large,\ncarefully-drawn chart. \"This line represents the hide-bound\nNationalists, whom nothing we can do will alienate from the party; this\none the equally hide-bound Cosmocrats. The balance of power lies, as\nalways, with the independents--these here. And many of them are not\nas independent as is supposed. We can buy or bring pressure to bear\non half of them--that cuts them down to this size here. So, no matter\nwhat the Patrol does, it can affect only this relatively small block\nhere, and it is this block we are fighting for. We are losing a little\nground, and steadily, yes; since we can't conceal from anybody with\nhalf a brain the fact that we're doing our best to keep the cases from\never coming to trial. But here's the actual observed line of sentiment,\nas determined from psychological indices up to yesterday; here is the\nextrapolation of that line to Election Day. It forecasts us to get just\nunder forty nine percent of the total vote.\"\n\n\"And is there anything cheerful about that?\" Fernald asked frostily.\n\n\"I'll say there is!\" Morgan's big face assumed a sneering smile, an\nexpression never seen by any voter. \"This chart deals only with living,\nlegally registered, bona-fide voters. Now if we can come that close\nto winning an absolutely honest election, how do you figure we can\npossibly lose the kind this one is going to be? We're in power, you\nknow. We've got this machine and we know how to use it.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I remember--vaguely. You told me about North American\npolitics once, a few years ago. Dead men, ringers, repeaters,\nballot-box stuffing, and so on, you said?\"\n\n\"'And so on' is right, Chief!\" Morgan assured him, heartily.\n\"Everything goes, this time. It'll be one of the biggest landslides in\nNorth American history.\"\n\n\"I will, then, defer any action until after the election.\"\n\n\"That will be the smart thing to do, Chief; then you won't have to take\nany, or make any report at all,\" and upon this highly satisfactory note\nthe conference closed.\n\nAnd Morgan was actually as confident as he had appeared. His\ncharts were actual and factual. He knew the power of money and the\neffectiveness of pressure; he knew the capabilities of the various\nunits of his machine. He did not, however, know two things: Jill Samms'\ninsidious, deeply-hidden Voters' Protective League and the bright\nflame of loyalty pervading the Galactic Patrol. Thus, between times\nof bellowing and screaming his carefully-prepared, rabble-rousing\nspeeches, he watched calmly and contentedly the devious workings of his\nsmooth and efficient organization.\n\nUntil the day before election, that is. Then hordes of young men and\nyoung women went suddenly and briefly to work; at least four in every\nprecinct of the entire nation. They visited, it seemed, every residence\nand every dwelling unit, everywhere. They asked questions, and took\nnotes, and vanished; and the machine's operatives, after the alarm\nwas given, could not find man or girl or notebook. And the Galactic\nPatrol, which had never before paid any attention to elections, had\ngiven leave and ample time to its every North American citizen. Vessels\nof the North American Contingent were grounded and practically emptied\nof personnel; bases and stations were depopulated; and even from every\ndistant world every Patrolman registered in any North American precinct\ncame to spend the day at home.\n\nMorgan began then to worry, but there was nothing he could do about the\nsituation--or was there? If the civilian boys and girls were checking\nthe registration books--and they were--it was as legally-appointed\ncheckers. If the uniformed boys and girls were all coming home to\nvote--and they were--that, too, was their inalienable right. But boys\nand girls were notoriously prone to accident and to debauchery ...\nbut again Morgan was surprised; and, this time, taken heavily aback.\nThe web which had protected Grand Rally so efficiently, but greatly\nenlarged now, was functioning again; and Morgan and his minions spent a\nsleepless and thoroughly uncomfortable night.\n\nElection Day dawned clear, bright, and cool; auguring a record\nturn-out. Voting was early and extraordinarily heavy; the polls were\ncrowded. There was, however, very little disorder. Surprisingly little,\nin view of the fact that the Cosmocratic watchers, instead of being\nthe venal wights of custom, were cold-eyed, unreachable men and women\nwho seemed to know by sight every voter in the precinct. At least they\nspotted on sight and challenged without hesitation every ringer, every\ndead one, every repeater, and every imposter who claimed the right\nto vote. And those challenges, being borne out in every case by the\ncarefully-checked registration lists, were in every case upheld.\n\nNot all of the policemen on duty, especially in the big cities, were\nabove suspicion, of course. But whenever any one of those officers\nbegan to show a willingness to play ball with the machine a calm,\nquiet-eyed Patrolman would remark, casually:\n\n\"Better see that this election stays straight, bud, and strictly\naccording to the lists and signatures--or you're apt to find yourself\nlisted in the big book along with the rest of the rats.\"\n\nIt was not that the machine liked the way things were going, or that it\ndid not have goon squads on the job. It was that there were, everywhere\nand always, more Patrolmen than there were goons. And those Patrolmen,\nhowever young in years some of them might have appeared to be, were\nspace-bronzed veterans, space-hardened fighting men, armed with the\nlast word in blasters--Lewiston, Mark Seventeen.\n\nTo the boy's friends and neighbors, of course, his Lewiston was\npractically invisible. It was merely an article of clothing, the same\nas his pants. It carried no more of significance, of threat or of\nmenace, than did the pistol and the club of the friendly Irish cop on\nthe beat. But the goon did not see the Patrolman as a friend. He saw\nthe keen, clear, sharply discerning eyes; the long, strong fingers;\nthe smoothly flowing muscles, so eloquent of speed and of power. He\nsaw the Lewiston for what it was; the deadliest, most destructive\nhand-weapon known to man. Above all he saw the difference in numbers:\nsix or seven or eight Patrolmen to four or five or six of his own kind.\nIf more hoods arrived, so did more spacemen; if some departed, so did a\ncorresponding number of the wearers of the space-black and silver.\n\n\"Ain't you getting tired of sticking around here, George?\" One mobster\nasked confidentially of one Patrolman. \"I am. What say we and some of\nyou fellows round up some girls and go have us a party?\"\n\n\"Uh-uh,\" George denied. His voice was gay and careless, but his eyes\nwere icy cold. \"My uncle's cousin's stepson is running for second\nassistant dog-catcher, and I can't leave until I find out whether he\nwins or not.\"\n\nThus nothing happened; thus the invisible but nevertheless terrific\ntension did not erupt into open battle; and thus, for the first time in\nNorth America's long history, a presidential election was ninety nine\nand ninety nine one-hundredths percent pure!\n\nEvening came. The polls closed. The Cosmocrats' headquarters for the\nday, the Grand Ballroom of the Hotel van der Voort, became the goal\nof every Patrolman who thought he stood any chance at all of getting\nin. Kinnison had been there all day, of course. So had Joy, his wife,\nwho for lack of space has been sadly neglected in these annals.\nBetty, their daughter, had come in early, accompanied by a husky and\npersonable young lieutenant, who has no other place in this story. Jack\nKinnison arrived, with Dimples Maynard--dazzlingly blonde, wearing a\nscreamingly red wisp of silk. She, too, has been shamefully slighted\nhere, although she was never slighted anywhere else.\n\n\"The first time I ever saw her,\" Jack was wont to say, \"I went right\ninto a flat spin, running around in circles and biting myself in the\nsmall of the back, and couldn't pull out of it for four hours!\"\n\nThat Miss Maynard should be a very special item is not at all\nsurprising, in view of the fact that she was to become the wife of one\nof THE Kinnisons and the mother of another.\n\nThe First Lensman, who had been in and out, came in to stay. So did\nJill and her inseparable, Mason Northrop. And so did others, singly or\nby twos or threes. Lensmen and their wives. Conway and Clio Costigan,\nDr. and Mrs. Rodebush, and Cleveland, Admiral and Mrs. Clayton, ditto\nSchweikert, and Dr. Nels Bergenholm. And others. Nor were they all\nNorth Americans, or even human. Rularion was there; and so was blocky,\nstocky Dronvire of Rigel Four. No outsider could tell, ever, what any\nLensman was thinking, to say nothing of such a monstrous Lensman as\nDronvire--but that hotel was being covered as no political headquarters\nhad ever been covered before.\n\nThe returns came in, see-sawing maddeningly back and forth. Faster and\nfaster. The Maritime Provinces split fifty-fifty. Maine, New Hampshire,\nand Vermont, Cosmocrat. New York, upstate, Cosmocrat. New York City,\non the basis of incomplete but highly significant returns, was piling\nup a huge Nationalist majority. Pennsylvania--labor--Nationalist.\nOhio--farmers--Cosmocrat. Twelve southern states went six and six.\nChicago, as usual, solidly for the machine; likewise Quebec and Ottawa\nand Montreal and Toronto and Detroit and Kansas City and St. Louis and\nNew Orleans and Denver.\n\nThen northern and western and far southern states came in and evened\nthe score. Saskatchewan, Alberta, Britcol, and Alaska, all went\nCosmocrat. So did Washington, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Nevada, Utah,\nArizona, Newmex, and most of the states of Mexico.\n\nAt three o'clock in the morning the Cosmocrats had a slight but\ndefinite lead and were, finally, holding it. At four o'clock the lead\nwas larger, but California was still an unknown quantity--California\ncould wreck everything. _How_ would California go? Especially, how\nwould California's two metropolitan districts--the two most independent\nand free-thinking and least predictable big cities of the nation--how\n_would_ they go?\n\nAt five o'clock California seemed safe. Except for Los Angeles and\nSan Francisco, the Cosmocrats had swept the state, and in those two\ngreat cities they held a commanding lead. It was still mathematically\npossible, however, for the Nationalists to win.\n\n\"It's in the bag! Let's start the celebration!\" someone shouted, and\nothers took up the cry.\n\n\"Stop it! No!\" Kinnison's parade-ground voice cut through the noise.\n\"No celebration is in order or will be held until the result becomes\ncertain or Witherspoon concedes!\"\n\nThe two events came practically together: Witherspoon conceded a couple\nof minutes before it became mathematically impossible for him to win.\nThen came the celebration, which went on and on interminably. At the\nfirst opportunity, however, Kinnison took Samms by the arm, led him\nwithout a word into a small office, and shut the door. Samms, also\nsaying nothing, sat down in the swivel chair, put both feet up on the\ndesk, lit a cigarette, and inhaled deeply.\n\n\"Well, Virge--satisfied?\" Kinnison broke the silence at last. His Lens\nwas off. \"We're on our way.\"\n\n\"Yes, Rod. Fully. At last.\" No more than his friend did he dare to\nuse his Lens; to plumb the depths he knew so well were there. \"Now it\nwill roll--under its own power--no one man now is or ever will be\nindispensable to the Galactic Patrol--_nothing_ can stop it now!\"\n\n\n\n\nEPILOGUE\n\n\nThe murder of Senator Morgan, in his own private office, was never\nsolved. If it had occurred before the election, suspicion would\ncertainly have fallen upon Roderick Kinnison, but as it was it did not.\nBy no stretch of the imagination could anyone conceive of \"Rod the\nRock\" kicking a man after he had knocked him down. Not that Morgan did\nnot have powerful and vindictive enemies in the underworld: he had so\nmany that it proved impossible to fasten the crime to any one of them.\n\nOfficially, Kinnison was on a five-year leave of absence from the\nGalactic Patrol, the office of Port Admiral had been detached entirely\nfrom the fleet and assigned to the Office of the President of North\nAmerica. Actually, however, in every respect that counted, Roderick\nKinnison was still Port Admiral, and would remain so until he died or\nuntil the Council retired him by force.\n\nOfficially, Kinnison was taking a short, well-earned vacation from the\njob in which he had been so outstandingly successful. Actually, he was\ndoing a quick flit to Petrine, to get personally acquainted with the\nnew Lensmen and to see what kind of a job they were doing. Besides,\nVirgil Samms was already there.\n\nHe arrived. He got acquainted. He saw. He approved.\n\n\"How about coming back to Tellus with me, Virge?\" he asked, when the\nvisiting was done. \"I've got to make a speech, and it'd be nice to have\nyou hold my head.\"\n\n\"I'd be glad to,\" and the _Chicago_ took off.\n\nHalf of North America was dark when they neared Tellus; all of it,\napparently, was obscured by clouds. Only the navigating officers of the\nvessel knew where they were, nor did either of the two Lensmen care.\nThey were having too much fun arguing about the talents and abilities\nof their respective grandsons.\n\nThe _Chicago_ landed. A bug was waiting. The two Lensmen, without an\norder being given, were whisked away. Samms had not asked where the\nspeech was to be given, and Kinnison simply did not realize that he\nhad not told him all about it. Thus Samms had no idea that he was just\nleaving Spokane Spaceport, Washington.\n\nAfter a few miles of fast, open-country driving the bug reached the\ncity. It slowed down, swung into brightly-lighted Maple Street, and\npassed a sign reading \"Cannon Hill\" something-or-other--neither of\nwhich names meant anything to either Lensman.\n\nKinnison looked at his friend's red-thatched head and glanced at his\nwatch.\n\n\"Looking at you reminds me--I need a haircut,\" he remarked. \"Should\nhave got one aboard, but didn't think of it Joy told me if I come home\nwithout it she'll braid it in pigtails and tie it up with pink ribbons,\nand you're shaggier than I am. You've got to get one or else buy\nyourself a violin. What say we do it now?\"\n\n\"Have we got time enough?\"\n\n\"Plenty.\" Then, to the driver: \"Stop at the first barber shop you see,\nplease.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. There's a good one a few blocks further along.\"\n\nThe bug sped down Maple Street, turned sharply into plainly-marked\nTwelfth Avenue. Neither Lensman saw the sign.\n\n\"Here you are, sir.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\nThere were two barbers and two chairs, both empty. The Lensmen,\nnoticing that the place was neatly kept and meticulously clean, sat\ndown and resumed their discussion of two extremely unusual infants. The\nbarbers went busily to work.\n\n\"Just as well, though--better, really--that the kids didn't marry each\nother, at that,\" Kinnison concluded finally. \"The way it is, we've each\ngot a grandson--it'd be tough to have to share one with _you_.\"\n\nSamms made no reply to this sally, for something was happening. The\nfact that this fair-skinned, yellow-haired blue-eyed barber was\nleft-handed had not rung any bells--there were lots of left-handed\nbarbers. He had neither seen nor heard the cat--a less-than-half-grown,\ngray, tiger-striped kitten--which, after standing up on its hind legs\nto sniff ecstatically at his nylon-clad ankles, had uttered a couple\nof almost inaudible \"meows\" and had begun to purr happily. Crouching,\ntensing its strong little legs, it leaped almost vertically upward. Its\ntail struck the barber's elbow.\n\nHastily brushing the kitten aside, and beginning profuse apologies both\nfor his awkwardness and for the presence of the cat--he had never\ndone such a thing before and he would drown him forthwith--the barber\napplied a styptic pencil and recollection hit Samms a pile-driver blow.\n\n\"Well, I'm a...!\" He voiced three highly un-Samms-like, highly specific\nexpletives which, as Mentor had foretold so long before, were both\nself-derogatory and profane. Then, as full realization dawned, he bit a\nword squarely in two.\n\n\"Excuse me, please, Mr. Carbonero, for this outrageous display. It was\nnot the scratch, nor was any of it your fault. Nothing you could have\ndone would have....\"\n\n\"You know my name?\" the astonished barber interrupted.\n\n\"Yes. You were ... ah ... recommended to me by a ... a friend....\"\nWhatever Samms could say would make things worse. The truth, wild as it\nwas, would have to be told, at least in part. \"You do not look like an\nItalian, but perhaps you have enough of that racial heritage to believe\nin prophecy?\"\n\n\"Of course, sir. There have always been prophets--_true_ prophets.\"\n\n\"Good. This event was foretold in detail; in such complete detail that\nI was deeply, terribly shocked. Even to the kitten. You call it Thomas.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Thomas Aquinas.\"\n\n\"It is actually a female. In here, Thomasina!\" The kitten had been\nclimbing enthusiastically up his leg; now, as he held a pocket\ninvitingly open, she sprang into it, settled down, and began to purr\nblissfully. While the barbers and Kinnison stared pop-eyed Samms went\non:\n\n\"She is determined to adopt me, and it would be a shame not to requite\nsuch affection. Would you part with her--for, say, ten credits?\"\n\n\"_Ten credits!_ I'll be glad to give her to you for nothing!\"\n\n\"Ten it is, then. One more thing. Rod, you always carry a pocket rule.\nMeasure this scratch, will you? You'll find it's mighty close to three\nmillimeters long.\"\n\n\"Not 'close', Virge--it's _exactly_ three millimeters, as near as this\nvernier can scale it.\"\n\n\"And just above and parallel to the cheek-bone.\"\n\n\"Check. Just above and as parallel as though it had been ruled there by\na draftsman.\"\n\n\"Well, that's that. Let's get finished with the haircuts, before you're\nlate for your speech,\" and the barbers, with thoughts which will be\nleft to the imagination, resumed their interrupted tasks.\n\n\"Spill it, Virge!\" Kinnison Lensed the pent-up thought. If Carbonero,\nwho did not know Samms at all, had been amazed at what had been\nhappening, Kinnison, who had known him so long and so well, had been\nliterally and completely dumbfounded. \"What in hell's behind this?\nWhat's the story? GIVE!\"\n\nSamms told him, and a mental silence fell; a silence too deep for\nintelligible thought.

It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org\n\n\n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\nlocations.

Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
