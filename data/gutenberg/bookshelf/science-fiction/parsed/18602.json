It started at seven, with cocktails.\nThey were served by his host, Paul Brennan, to the celebrants, the boy's\nfather and mother. The guest of honor sipped ginger ale and nibbled at\ncanap\u00e9s while he was presented with his gifts: A volume of Kipling's\n_Jungle Tales_, a Spitz Junior Planetarium, and a build-it-yourself kit\ncontaining parts for a geiger counter and an assortment of radioactive\nminerals to identify. Dinner was served at eight, the menu selected by\nJimmy Holden--with the exception of the birthday cake and its five proud\nlittle candles which came as an anticipated surprise from his \"Uncle\"\nPaul Brennan.\n\nAfter dinner, they listened to some music chosen by the boy, and the\nevening wound up with three rubbers of bridge. The boy won.\n\nThey left Paul Brennan's apartment just after eleven o'clock. Jimmy\nHolden was tired and pleasantly stuffed with good food. But he was\nstimulated by the party. So, instead of dropping off to sleep, he sat\ncomfortably wedged between his father and mother, quietly lost in his own\nthoughts until the car was well out of town.\n\nThen he said, \"Dad, why did you make that sacrifice bid on the last\nhand?\" Father and son had been partners.\n\n\"You're not concerned about losing the rubber, are you?\" It had been the\nonly rubber Jimmy lost.\n\n\"No. It's only a game,\" said Jimmy. \"I'm just trying to understand.\"\n\nHis father gave an amused groan. \"It has to do with the laws of\nprobability and the theory of games,\" he said.\n\nThe boy shook his head. \"Bridge,\" he said thoughtfully, \"consists of\ncreating a logical process of play out of a random distribution of\nvalues, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes, if you admit that your definition is a gross oversimplification. It\nwould hardly be a game if everything could be calculated beforehand.\"\n\n\"But what's missing?\"\n\n\"In any game there is the element of a calculated risk.\"\n\nJimmy Holden was silent for a half-mile thinking that one over. \"How,\" he\nasked slowly, \"can a risk be calculated?\"\n\nHis father laughed. \"In fine, it can't. Too much depends upon the\npersonality of the individual.\"\n\n\"Seems to me,\" said Jimmy, \"that there's not much point in making a bid\nagainst a distribution of values known to be superior. You couldn't hope\nto make it; Mother and Uncle Paul had the cards.\"\n\nHis father laughed again. \"After a few more courses in higher\nmathematics, James, you'll begin to realize that some of the highest\nmathematics is aimed at predicting the unpredictable, or trying to lower\nthe entropy of random behavior--\"\n\nJimmy Holden's mother chuckled. \"Now explain entropy,\" she said. \"James,\nwhat your father has been failing to explain is really not subject to\nsimple analysis. Who knows why any man will hazard his hard-earned money\non the orientation of a pair of dice? No amount of education nor academic\nstudy will explain what drives a man. Deep inside, I suppose it is the\nsame force that drives everybody. One man with four spades will take a\nchance to see if he can make five, and another man with directorships in\nthree corporations will strive to make it four.\"\n\nJimmy's father chuckled. \"Some families with one infant will try to make\nit two--\"\n\n\"Not on your life!\"\n\n\"--And some others are satisfied with what they've got,\" finished Jimmy\nHolden's father. \"James, some men will avoid seeing what has to be done;\nsome men will see it and do it and do no more; and a few men will see\nwhat has to be done, do it, and then look to the next inevitable problem\ncreated by their own act--\"\n\nA blinding flash of light cut a swath across the road, dazzling them.\nAround the curve ahead, a car careened wide over the white line. His\nmother reached for him, his father fought the wheel to avoid the crash.\nJimmy Holden both heard and felt the sharp _Bang!_ as the right front\ntire went. The steering wheel snapped through his father's hands by half\na turn. There was a splintering crash as the car shattered its way\nthrough the retaining fence, then came a fleeting moment of breathless\nsilence as if the entire universe had stopped still for a heartbeat.\n\nChaos! His mother's automatic scream, his father's oath, and the rending\ncrash split the silence at once. The car bucked and flipped, the doors\nwere slammed open and ripped off against a tree that went down. The car\nleaped in a skew turn and began to roll and roll, shedding metal and\nhumans as it racketed down the ravine.\n\nJimmy felt himself thrown free in a tumbleturn that ended in a heavy\nthud.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen breath and awareness returned, he was lying in a depression filled\nwith soft rotting leaves.\n\nHe was dazed beyond hurt. The initial shock and bewilderment oozed out of\nhim, leaving him with a feeling of outrage, and a most peculiar sensation\nof being a spectator rather than an important part of the violent drama.\nIt held an air of unreality, like a dream that the near-conscious sleeper\nrecognizes as a dream and lives through it because he lacks the conscious\nwill to direct it.\n\nStrangely, it was as if there were three or more of him all thinking\ndifferent things at the same time. He wanted his mother badly enough to\ncry. Another part of him said that she would certainly be at his side if\nshe were able. Then a third section of his confused mind pointed out that\nif she did not come to him, it was because she herself was hurt deeply\nand couldn't.\n\nA more coldly logical portion of his mind was urging him to get up and\n_do_ something about it. They had passed a telephone booth on the\nhighway; lying there whimpering wasn't doing anybody any good. This\nlogical part of his confused mind did not supply the dime for the\ntelephone slot nor the means of scaling the heights needed to insert\nthe dime in the adult-altitude machine.\n\nWhether the dazzle of mental activity was serial or simultaneous isn't\nimportant. The fact is that it was completely disorganized as to plan\nor program, it leaped from one subject to another until he heard the\nscrabble and scratch of someone climbing down the side of the ravine.\n\nAny noise meant help. With relief, Jimmy tried to call out.\n\nBut with this arrival of help, afterfright claimed him. His mouth\nworked silently before a dead-dry throat and his muscles twitched in\nuncontrolled nervousness; he made neither sound nor motion. Again he\nwatched with the unreal feeling of being a remote spectator. A cone of\nlight from a flashlight darted about and it gradually seeped into Jimmy's\nshocked senses that this was a new arrival, picking his way through the\ntangle of brush, following the trail of ruin from the broken guard rail\nto the smashed car below.\n\nThe newcomer paused. The light darted forward to fall upon a crumpled\nmass of cloth.\n\nWith a toe, the stranger probed at crushed ribs. A pitifully feeble\nmoan came from the broken rag doll that lay on the ground. The searcher\nknelt with his light close to peer into the bloody face, and,\nunbelieving, Jimmy Holden heard the voice of his mother straining\nto speak, \"Paul--I--we--\"\n\nThe voice died in a gurgle.\n\nThe man with the flashlight tested the flaccid neck by bending the head\nto one side and back sharply. He ended this inspection by letting the\nhead fall back to the moist earth. It landed with a thud of finality.\n\nThe cold brutality of this stranger's treatment of his mother shocked\nJimmy Holden into frantic outrage. The frozen cry for help changed into\nprotesting anger; no one should be treated that--\n\n\"One!\" muttered the stranger flatly.\n\nJimmy's burst of protest died in his throat and he watched, fascinated,\nas the stranger's light moved in a sweep forward to stop a second time.\n\"And there's number two!\" The callous horror was repeated. Hypnotically,\nJimmy Holden watched the stranger test the temples and wrists and try a\nhand under his father's heart. He watched the stranger make a detailed\ninspection of the long slash that laid open the entire left abdomen and\nhe saw the red that seeped but did not flow.\n\n\"That's that!\" said the stranger with an air of finality. \"Now--\" and he\nstood up to swing his flashlight in widening circles, searching the area\ncarefully.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJimmy Holden did not sicken. He went cold. He froze as the dancing\nflashlight passed over his head, and relaxed partially when it moved\naway in a series of little jumps pausing to give a steady light for\nclose inspection. The light swung around and centered on the smashed\nautomobile. It was upside down, a ruin with one wheel still turning idly.\n\nThe stranger went to it, and knelt to peer inside. He pried ripped metal\naway to get a clear sight into the crushed interior. He went flat on his\nstomach and tried to penetrate the area between the crumpled car-top and\nthe bruised ground, and he wormed his way in a circle all around the car,\nexamining the wreck minutely.\n\nThe sound of a distant automobile engine became audible, and the\nsearching man mumbled a curse. With haste he scrambled to his feet and\nmade a quick inspection of the one wabbly-turning wheel. He stripped a\nfew shards of rubber away, picked at something in the bent metal rim, and\nput whatever he found in his pocket. When his hand came from the pocket\nit held a packet of paper matches. With an ear cocked at the road above\nand the sound of the approaching car growing louder, the stranger struck\none match and touched it to the deck of matches. Then with a callous\ngesture he tossed the flaring pack into a pool of spilled gasoline. The\nfuel went up in a blunt _whoosh_!\n\nThe dancing flames revealed the face of Jimmy Holden's \"Uncle\" Paul\nBrennan, his features in a mask that Jimmy Holden had never seen before.\n\nWith the determined air of one who knows that still another piece lies\nhidden, Paul Brennan started to beat back and forth across the trail of\nruin. His light swept the ground like the brush of a painter, missing no\nspot. Slowly and deliberately he went, paying no attention to the\ncreeping tongues of flame that crept along damp trails of spilled\ngasoline.\n\nJimmy Holden felt helplessly alone.\n\nFor \"Uncle\" Paul Brennan was the laughing uncle, the golden uncle; his\ngodfather; the bringer of delightful gifts and the teller of fabulous\nstories. Classmate of his father and admirer of his mother, a friend to\nbe trusted as he trusted his father and mother, as they trusted Paul\nBrennan. Jimmy Holden did not and could not understand, but he could feel\nthe presence of menace. And so with the instinct of any trapped animal,\nhe curled inward upon himself and cringed.\n\nEducation and information failed. Jimmy Holden had been told and told and\ninstructed, and the words had been graven deep in his mind by the same\nfabulous machine that his father used to teach him his grammar and his\nvocabulary and his arithmetic and the horde of other things that made\nJimmy Holden what he was: \"If anything happens to us, you must turn to\nPaul Brennan!\"\n\nBut nothing in his wealth of extraordinary knowledge covered the way to\nsafety when the trusted friend turned fiend.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShaken by the awful knowledge that all of his props had been kicked out\nfrom under him, now at last Jimmy Holden whimpered in helpless fright.\nBrennan turned towards the sound and began to beat his way through the\nunderbrush.\n\nJimmy Holden saw him coming. It was like one of those dreams he'd had\nwhere he was unable to move, his muscles frozen, as some unknown horror\nstalked him. It could only end in a terrifying fall through cold space\ntowards a tremendous lurch against the bedsprings that brought little\ncomfort until his pounding heart came back to normal. But this was no\ndream; it was a known horror that stalked him, and it could not end as\na dream ends. It was reality.\n\nThe horror was a close friend turned animal, and the end was more\nhorrible because Jimmy Holden, like all other five-year-olds, had\nabsolutely no understanding nor accurate grasp of the concept called\n_death_. He continued to whimper even though he realized that his fright\nwas pointing him out to his enemy. And yet he had no real grasp of the\nconcept _enemy_. He knew about pain; he had been hurt. But only by falls,\nsimple misadventures, the needles of inoculation administered by his\nsurgeon mother, a paddling for mischief by his engineer father.\n\nBut whatever unknown fate was coming was going to be worse than \"hurt.\"\nIt was frightful.\n\nThen fate, assisted by Brennan's own act of trying to obliterate any\npossible evidence by fire, attracted a savior. The approaching car\nstopped on the road above and a voice called out, \"Hello, down there!\"\n\nBrennan could not refuse to answer; his own car was in plain sight by the\nshattered retaining fence. He growled under his breath, but he called\nback, \"Hello, the road! Go get the police!\"\n\n\"Can we help?\"\n\n\"Beyond help!\" cried Brennan. \"I'm all right. Get the cops!\"\n\nThe car door slammed before it took off. Then came the unmistakable\nsounds of another man climbing down the ravine. A second flashlight swung\nhere and there until the newcomer faced Brennan in the little circle of\nlight.\n\n\"What happened?\" asked the uninvited volunteer.\n\nBrennan, whatever his thoughts, said in a voice filled with standard\nconcern: \"Blowout. Then everything went blooey.\"\n\n\"Anyone--I mean how many--?\"\n\n\"Two dead,\" said Brennan, and then added because he had to, \"and a little\nboy lost.\"\n\nThe stranger eyed the flames and shuddered. \"In there?\"\n\n\"Parents were tossed out. Boy's missing.\"\n\n\"Bad,\" said the stranger. \"God, what a mess. Know 'em?\"\n\n\"Holdens. Folks that live in the big old house on the hill. My best\nfriend and his wife. I was following them home,\" lied Brennan glibly.\n\"C'mon let's see if we can find the kid. What about the police?\"\n\n\"Sent my wife. Telephone down the road.\"\n\nPaul Brennan's reply carried no sound of disappointment over being\ninterrupted. \"Okay. Let's take a look. You take it that way, and I'll\ncover this side.\"\n\nThe little-boy mind did not need its extensive education to understand\nthat Paul Brennan needed no more than a few seconds of unobserved\nactivity, after which he could announce the discovery of the third death\nin a voice cracked with false grief.\n\nAnimal instinct took over where intelligence failed. The same force that\ncaused Jimmy Holden to curl within himself now caused him to relax; help\nthat could be trusted was now at hand. The muscles of his throat relaxed.\nHe whimpered. The icy paralysis left his arms and legs; he kicked and\nflailed. And finally his nervous system succeeded in making their contact\nwith his brain; the nerves carried the pain of his bumps and scratches,\nand Jimmy Holden began to hurt. His stifled whimper broke into a\nshuddering cry, which swiftly turned into sobbing hysteria.\n\nHe went out of control. Nothing, not even violence, would shake him back\nuntil his accumulation of shock upon shock had been washed away in tears.\n\nThe sound attracted both men. Side by side they beat through the\nunderbrush. They reached for him and Jimmy turned toward the stranger.\nThe man picked the lad out of the bed of soft rotting leaves, cradled him\nand stroked his head. Jimmy wrapped his small arms around the stranger's\nneck and held on for life.\n\n\"I'll take him,\" said Brennan, reaching out.\n\nJimmy's clutch on the stranger tightened.\n\n\"You won't pry him loose easily,\" chuckled the man. \"I know. I've got a\ncouple of these myself.\"\n\nBrennan shrugged. \"I thought perhaps--\"\n\n\"Forget it,\" said the stranger. \"Kid's had trouble. I'll carry him to the\nroad, you take him from there.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nGetting up the ravine was a job of work for the man who carried Jimmy\nHolden. Brennan gave a hand, aided with a lift, broke down brush, and\noffered to take Jimmy now and again. Jimmy only clung tighter, and the\nstranger waved Brennan away with a quick shake of his head.\n\nBy the time they reached the road, sirens were wailing on the road up\nthe hill. Police, firemen, and an ambulance swarmed over the scene. The\nfiremen went to work on the flaming car with practiced efficiency; the\npolice clustered around Paul Brennan and extracted from him a story that\nhad enough truth in it to sound completely convincing. The doctors from\nthe ambulance took charge of Jimmy Holden. Lacking any other accident\nvictim, they went to work on him with everything they could do.\n\nThey gave him mild sedation, wrapped him in a warm blanket, and put him\nto bed on the cot in the ambulance with two of them watching over him. In\nthe presence of so many solicitous strangers, Jimmy's shock and fright\ndiminished. The sedation took hold. He dropped off in a light doze that\ngrew less fitful as time went on. By the time the official accident\nreport program was over, Jimmy Holden was fast asleep and resting\ncomfortably.\n\nHe did not hear Paul Brennan's suggestion that Jimmy go home with him,\nto Paul Brennan's personal physician, nor did Jimmy hear the ambulance\nattendants turn away Brennan's suggestion with hard-headed medical\nopinion. Brennan could hardly argue with the fact that an accident victim\nwould be better off in a hospital under close observation. Shock demanded\nit, and there was the hidden possibility of internal injury or concussion\nto consider.\n\nSo Jimmy Holden awoke with his accident ten hours behind him, and the\ngood sleep had completed the standard recuperative powers of the healthy\nchild. He looked around, collecting himself, and then remembered the\naccident. He cringed a bit and took another look and identified his\nsurroundings as some sort of a children's ward or dormitory.\n\nHe was in a crib.\n\nHe sat up angrily and rattled the gate of the crib. Putting James Quincy\nHolden in a baby's crib was an insult.\n\nHe stopped, because the noise echoed through the room and one of the\nyounger patients stirred in sleep and moaned. Jimmy Holden sat back and\nremembered. The vacuum that was to follow the loss of his parents was not\nyet in evidence. They were gone and the knowledge made him unhappy, but\nhe was not cognizant of the real meaning or emotion of grief. With almost\nthe same feeling of loss he thought of the _Jungle Book_ he would never\nread and the Spitz Planetarium he would never see casting its little star\nimages on his bedroom ceiling. Burned and ruined, with the atomic energy\nkit--and he had hoped that he could use the kit to tease his father into\ngiving him some education in radioactivity. He was old enough to learn--\n\nLearn--?\n\n_No more, now that his father and mother were dead._\n\nSome of the real meaning of his loss came to him then, and the growing\nknowledge that this first shocking loss meant the ultimate loss of\neverything was beginning to sink in.\n\nHe broke down and cried in the misery of his loss and his helplessness;\nultimately his emotion began to cry itself out, and he began to feel\nresentment against his position. The animal desire to bite back at\nanything that moved did not last long, it focused properly upon the\nperson of his tormentor. Then for a time, Jimmy Holden's imagination\nindulged in a series of little vignettes in which he scored his victory\nover Paul Brennan. These little playlets went through their own\nevolution, starting with physical victory reminiscent of his\nJack-and-the-Beanstalk days to a more advanced triumph of watching Paul\nBrennan led away in handcuffs whilst the District Attorney scanned the\nsheaf of indisputable evidence provided by James Quincy Holden.\n\nSomewhere along about this point in his fantasy, a breath of the\npractical entered, and Jimmy began to consider the more sensible problem\nof what sort of information this sheaf of evidence would contain.\n\nStill identifying himself with the books he knew, Jimmy Holden had\nprogressed from the fairy story--where the villain was evil for no more\nmotive than to provide menace to the hero--to his more advanced books,\nwhere the villain did his evil deeds for the logical motive of personal\ngain.\n\nWell, what had Paul Brennan to gain?\n\nMoney, for one thing--he would be executor of the Holden Estate. But\nthere wasn't enough to justify killing. Revenge? For what? Jealousy? For\nwhom? Hate? Envy? Jimmy Holden glossed the words quickly, for they were\nno more than words that carried definitions that did not really explain\nthem. He could read with the facility of an adult, but a book written for\na sophisticated audience went over his head.\n\nNo, there was only one possible thing of appreciable value; the one thing\nthat Paul Brennan hoped to gain was the device over which they had worked\nthrough all the long years to perfect: The Holden Electromechanical\nEducator! Brennan wanted it badly enough to murder for its possession!\n\nAnd with a mind and ingenuity far beyond his years, Jimmy Holden knew\nthat he alone was the most active operator in this vicious drama. It was\nnot without shock that he realized that he himself could still be killed\nto gain possession of his fabulous machine. For only with all _three_\nHoldens dead could Paul Brennan take full and unquestioned possession.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith daylight clarity he knew what he had to do. In a single act of\ndestruction he could simultaneously foil Paul Brennan's plan and ensure\nhis own life.\n\nPermanently installed in Jimmy Holden's brain by the machine itself were\nthe full details of how to recreate it. Indelibly he knew each wire and\nlink, lever and coil, section by section and piece by piece. It was\nincomprehensible information, about in the same way that the printing\npress \"knows\" the context of its metal plate. Step by step he could\nrebuild it once he had the means of procuring the parts, and it would\nwork even though he had not the foggiest notion (now) of what the various\nparts did.\n\nSo if the delicate heart of his father's machine were utterly destroyed,\nPaul Brennan would be extremely careful about preserving the life of\nJames Quincy Holden.\n\nHe considered his position and what he knew:\n\nPhysically, he was a five-year-old. He stood forty-one inches tall and\nweighed thirty-nine pounds. A machinist's hammer was a two-handed tool\nand a five-pound sack of sugar was a burden. Doorknobs and latches were a\nproblem in manipulation. The negotiation of a swinging door was a feat of\nmuscular engineering. Electric light switches were placed at a tiptoe\nreach because, naturally, everything in the adult world is designed by\nthe adults for the convenience of adults. This makes it difficult for the\nchild who has no adult to do his bidding.\n\nIntellectually, Jimmy Holden was something else.\n\nReverting to a curriculum considered sound prior to Mr. Dewey's\noften-questionable and more often misused programs of schooling, Jimmy's\nparents had trained and educated their young man quite well in the\nprimary informations of fact. He read with facility and spoke with a fine\nvocabulary--although no amount of intellectual training could make his\nvoice change until his glands did. His knowledge of history, geography\nand literature were good, because he'd used them to study reading. He was\nwell into plane geometry and had a smattering of algebra, and there had\nbeen a pause due to a parental argument as to the advisability of his\nmemorizing a table of six-place logarithms via the Holden machine.\n\nExtra-curricularly, Jimmy Holden had acquired snippets, bits, and\nwholesale chunks of a number of the arts and sciences and other\naggregations of information both pertinent and trivial for one reason\nor another. As an instance, he had absorbed an entire bridge book by\nCharles Goren just to provide a fourth to sit in with his parents and\nPaul Brennan.\n\nConsequently, James Holden had in data the education of a boy of about\nsixteen, and in other respects, much more.\n\nHe escaped from the hospital simply because no one ever thought that a\nfive-year-old boy would have enough get-up-and-go to climb out of his\ncrib, rummage a nearby closet, dress himself, and then calmly walk out.\nThe clothing of a cocky teen-ager would have been impounded and his\nbehavior watched.\n\nThey did not miss him for hours. He went, taking the little\nidentification card from its frame at the foot of his bed--and that\nruined the correlation between tag and patient.\n\nBy the time an overworked nurse stopped to think and finally asked,\n\"Kitty, are you taking care of the little boy in Bed 6 over in 219?\" and\nreceived the answer, \"No, aren't you?\" Jimmy Holden was trudging up the\nhill towards his home. Another hour went by with the two worried nurses\nsurreptitiously searching the rest of the hospital in the simple hope\nthat he had wandered away and could be restored before it came to the\nattention of the officials. By the time they gave up and called in other\nnurses (who helped them in their anxiety to conceal) Jimmy was entering\nhis home.\n\nEach succeeding level of authority was loath to report the truth to the\nnext higher up.\n\nBy the time the general manager of the hospital forced himself to call\nPaul Brennan, Jimmy Holden was demolishing the last broken bits of\ndisassembled subassemblies he had smashed from the heart-circuit of the\nHolden Electromechanical Educator. He was most thorough. Broken glass\nwent into the refuse buckets, bent metal was buried in the garden,\ninflammables were incinerated, and meltables and fusibles slagged down in\nashes that held glass, bottle, and empty tin-can in an unrecognizable\nmass. He left a gaping hole in the machine that Brennan could not\nfill--nor could any living man fill it now but James Quincy Holden.\n\nAnd only when this destruction was complete did Jimmy Holden first begin\nto understand his father's statement about the few men who see what has\nto be done, do it, _and then_ look to the next inevitable problem created\nby their own act.\n\nIt was late afternoon by the time Jimmy had his next moves figured out.\nHe left the home he'd grown up in, the home of his parents, of his own\nbabyhood. He'd wandered through it for the last time, touching this and\nsaying goodbye to that. He was certain that he would never see his things\nagain, nor the house itself, but the real vacuum of his loss hadn't yet\nstarted to form. The concepts of \"never\" and \"forever\" were merely words\nthat had no real impact.\n\nSo was the word \"Farewell.\"\n\nBut once his words were said, Jimmy Holden made his small but confident\nway to the window of a railroad ticket agent.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\n\nYou are a ticket agent, settled in the routine of your job. From nine to\nfive-thirty, five days a week, you see one face after another. There are\ncheerful faces, sullen faces, faces that breathe garlic, whiskey, chewing\ngum, toothpaste and tobacco fumes. Old faces, young faces, dull faces,\nscarred faces, clear faces, plain faces and faces so plastered with\nmakeup that their nature can't be seen at all. They bark place-names at\nyou, or ask pleasantly about the cost of round-trip versus one-way\ntickets to Chicago or East Burlap. You deal with them and then you wait\nfor the next.\n\nThen one afternoon, about four o'clock, a face barely visible over the\nedge of the marble counter looks up at you with a boy's cheerful freckled\nsmile. You have to stand up in order to see him. You smile, and he grins\nat you. Among his belongings is a little leather suitcase, kid's size,\nbut not a toy. He is standing on it. Under his arm is a collection of\ncomic books, in one small fist is the remains of a candy bar and in the\nother the string of a floating balloon.\n\n\"Well, young man, where to? Paris? London? Maybe Mars?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" comes the piping voice, \"Roun-tree.\"\n\n\"Roundtree? Yes, I've heard of that metropolis,\" you reply. You look over\nhis head, there aren't any other customers in line behind him so you\ndon't mind passing the time of day. \"Round-trip or one-way?\"\n\n\"One-way,\" comes the quick reply.\n\nThis brings you to a slow stop. He does not giggle nor prattle, nor\nlaunch into a long and involved explanation with halting, dependent\nclauses. This one knows what he wants and how to ask for it. Quite a\nlittle man!\n\n\"How old are you, young fellow?\"\n\n\"I was five years old yesterday.\"\n\n\"What's your name?\"\n\n\"I'm James Holden.\"\n\nThe name does not ring any bells--because the morning newspaper is\npurchased for its comic strips, the bridge column, the crossword puzzle,\nand the latest dope on love-nest slayings, peccadilloes of the famous,\nthe cheesecake photo of the inevitable actress-leaving-for-somewhere, and\nthe full page photograph of the latest death-on-the-highway debacle. You\nlook at the picture but you don't read the names in the caption, so you\ndon't recognize the name, and you haven't been out of your little cage\nsince lunchtime and Jimmy Holden was not missing then. So you go on:\n\n\"So you're going to go to Roundtree.\"\n\n\"Yessir.\"\n\n\"That costs a lot of money, young Mister Holden.\"\n\n\"Yessir.\" Then this young man hands you an envelope; the cover says,\ntypewritten: _Ticket Clerk, Midland Railroad_.\n\nA bit puzzled, you open the envelope and find a five-dollar bill folded\nin a sheet of manuscript paper. The note says:\n\n  Ticket Clerk\n  Midland Railroad\n  Dear Sir:\n\n  This will introduce my son, James Holden. As a birthday present, I am\n  sending him for a visit to his grandparents in Roundtree, and to make\n  the adventure complete, he will travel alone. Pass the word along to\n  keep an eye on him but don't step in unless he gets into trouble. Ask\n  the dining car steward to see that he eats dinner on something better\n  than candy bars.\n\n  Otherwise, he is to believe that he is making this trip completely on\n  his own.\n\n  Sincerely, Louis Holden.\n\n  PS: Divide the change from this five dollars among you as tips. L.H.\n\nAnd so you look down at young Mister Holden and get a feeling of\nvicarious pleasure. You stamp his ticket and hand it to him with a\ngesture. You point out the train-gate he is to go through, and you tell\nhim that he is to sit in the third railroad car. As he leaves, you pick\nup the telephone and call the station-master, the conductor, and since\nyou can't get the dining-car steward directly, you charge the conductor\nwith passing the word along.\n\nThen you divide the change. Of the two-fifty, you extract a dollar,\nfeeling that the Senior Holden is a cheapskate. You slip the other buck\nand a half into an envelope, ready for the conductor's hand. He'll think\nHolden Senior is more of a cheapskate, and by the time he extracts his\ncut, the dining car steward will _know_ that Holden Senior is a\ncheapskate. But--\n\nThen a face appears at your window and barks, \"Holyoke, Mass.,\" and your\nnormal day falls back into shape.\n\nThe response of the people you tell about it varies all the way from\noutrage that anybody would let a kid of five go alone on such a dangerous\nmission to loud bragging that he, too, once went on such a journey, at\nfour and a half, and didn't need a note.\n\nBut Jimmy Holden is gone from your window, and you won't know for at\nleast another day that you've been suckered by a note painstakingly\ntypewritten, letter by letter, by a five-year-old boy who has a most\nremarkable vocabulary.\n\nJimmy's trip to Roundtree was without incident. Actually, it was easy\nonce he had hurdled the ticket-seller with his forged note and the\nfive-dollar bill from the cashbox in his father's desk. His error in not\nmaking it a ten was minor; a larger tip would not have provided him with\nbetter service, because the train crew were happy to keep an eye on the\nadventurous youngster for his own small sake. Their mild resentment\nagainst the small tip was directed against the boy's father, not the\nyoung passenger himself.\n\nHe had one problem. The train was hardly out of the station before\neverybody on it knew that there was a five-year-old making a trip all\nby himself. Of course, he was not to be bothered, but everybody wanted\nto talk to him, to ask him how he was, to chatter endlessly at him.\nJimmy did not want to talk. His experience in addressing adults was\nexasperating. That he spoke lucid English instead of babygab did not\ncompel a rational response. Those who heard him speak made over him\nwith the same effusive superiority that they used in applauding a\ngolden-haired tot in high heels and a strapless evening gown sitting\non a piano and singing, _Why Was I Born?_ in a piping, uncertain-toned\nvoice. It infuriated him.\n\nSo he immersed himself in his comic books. He gave his name politely\nevery five minutes for the first fifty miles. He turned down offers of\ncandy with, \"Mommy says I mustn't before supper.\" And when dinnertime\ncame he allowed himself to be escorted through the train by the\nconductor, because Jimmy knew that he couldn't handle the doors without\nhelp.\n\nThe steward placed a menu in front of him, and then asked carefully, \"How\nmuch money do you want to spend, young man?\"\n\nJimmy had the contents of his father's cashbox pinned to the inside of\nhis shirt, and a five-dollar bill folded in a snap-top purse with some\nchange in his shirt pocket. He could add with the best of them, but he\ndid not want any more attention than he was absolutely forced to attract.\nSo he fished out the snap-top purse and opened it to show the steward his\nfive-dollar bill. The steward relaxed; he'd had a moment of apprehension\nthat Holden Senior might have slipped the kid a half-dollar for dinner.\n(The steward had received a quarter for his share of the original\ntwo-fifty.)\n\nJimmy looked at the \"Child's Dinner\" menu and pointed out a plate: lamb\nchop and mashed potatoes. After that, dinner progressed without incident.\nJimmy topped it off with a dish of ice cream.\n\nThe steward made change. Jimmy watched him carefully, and then said,\n\"Daddy says I'm supposed to give you a tip. How much?\"\n\nThe steward looked down, wondering how he could explain the standard\ndining car tip of fifteen or twenty percent of the bill. He took a\nswallow of air and picked out a quarter. \"This will do nicely,\" he said\nand went off thankful that all people do not ask waiters how much they\nthink they deserve for the service rendered.\n\nThus Jimmy Holden arrived in Roundtree and was observed and convoyed--but\nnot bothered--off the train.\n\nIt is deplorable that adults are not as friendly and helpful to one\nanother as they are to children; it might make for a more pleasant world.\nAs Jimmy walked along the station platform at Roundtree, one of his\nformer fellow-passengers walked beside him. \"Where are you going, young\nman? Someone going to meet you, of course?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" said Jimmy. \"I'm supposed to take a cab--\"\n\n\"I'm going your way, why not ride along with me?\"\n\n\"Sure it's all right?\"\n\n\"Sure thing. Come along.\" Jimmy never knew that this man felt good for a\nweek after he'd done his good turn for the year.\n\nHis grandfather opened the door and looked down at him in complete\nsurprise. \"Why, Jimmy! What are you doing here? Who brought--\"\n\nHis grandmother interrupted, \"Come in! Come in! Don't just stand there\nwith the door open!\"\n\nGrandfather closed the door firmly, grandmother knelt and folded Jimmy\nin her arms and crooned over him, \"You poor darling. You brave little\nfellow. Donald,\" she said firmly to her husband, \"go get a glass of warm\nmilk and some cookies.\" She led Jimmy to the old-fashioned parlor and\nseated him on the sofa. \"Now, Jimmy, you relax a moment and then you can\ntell me what happened.\"\n\nJimmy sighed and looked around. The house was old, and comfortably\nsturdy. It gave him a sense of refuge, of having reached a safe haven at\nlast. The house was over-warm, and there was a musty smell of over-aged\nfurniture, old leather, and the pungence of mothballs. It seemed to\ngenerate a feeling of firm stability. Even the slightly stale air--there\nprobably hadn't been a wide open window since the storm sashes were\ninstalled last autumn--provided a locked-in feeling that conversely meant\nthat the world was locked out.\n\nGrandfather brought in the glass of warmed milk and a plate of cookies.\nHe sat down and asked, \"What happened, Jimmy?\"\n\n\"My mother and father are--\"\n\n\"You eat your cookies and drink your milk,\" ordered his grandmother. \"We\nknow. That Mr. Brennan sent us a telegram.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was slightly more than twenty-four hours since Jimmy Holden had blown\nout the five proud candles on his birthday cake and begun to open his\nfine presents. Now it all came back with a rush, and when it came back,\nnothing could stop it.\n\nJimmy never knew how very like a little boy of five he sounded that\nnight. His speech was clear enough, but his troubled mind was too full\nto take the time to form his headlong thoughts into proper sentences.\nHe could not pause to collect his thoughts into any chronology, so it\ncame out going back and forth all in a single line, punctuated only by\nnecessary pauses for the intake of breath. He was close to tears before\nhe was halfway through, and by the time he came to the end he stopped in\na sob and broke out crying.\n\nHis grandfather said, \"Jimmy, aren't you exaggerating? Mr. Brennan isn't\nthat sort of a man.\"\n\n\"He is too!\" exploded Jimmy through his tears. \"I saw him!\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Donald, this is no time to start cross-examining a child.\" She crossed\nthe room and lifted him onto her lap; she stroked his head and held his\ncheek against her shoulder. His open crying subsided into deep sobs; from\nsomewhere she found a handkerchief and made him blow his nose--once,\ntwice, and then a deep thrice. \"Get me a warm washcloth,\" she told her\nhusband, and with it she wiped away his tears. The warmth soothed Jimmy\nmore.\n\n\"Now,\" she said firmly, \"before we go into this any more we'll have a\ngood night's sleep.\"\n\nThe featherbed was soft and cozy. Like protecting mother-wings, it folded\nJimmy into its bosom, and the warm softness drew out of Jimmy whatever\nremained of his stamina. Tonight he slept of weariness and exhaustion,\nnot of the sedation given last night. Here he felt at home, and it was\ngood.\n\nAnd as tomorrows always had, tomorrow would take care of itself.\n\nJimmy Holden's father and mother first met over an operating table,\ndressed in the white sterility that leaves only the eyes visible. She\nwielded the trephine that laid the patient's brain bare, he kept track of\nthe patient's life by observing the squiggles on the roll of graph paper\nthat emerged from his encephalograph. She knew nothing of the craft of\nthe delicate instrument-creator, and he knew even less of the craft of\nsurgery. There had been a near-argument during the cleaning-up session\nafter the operation; the near-argument ended when they both realized that\nneither of them understood a word of what the other was saying. So the\nnear-argument became an animated discussion, the general meaning of\nwhich became clear: Brain surgeons should know more about the intricacies\nof electromechanics, and the designers of delicate, precision\ninstrumentation should know more about the mass of human gray matter they\nwere trying to measure.\n\nThey pooled their intellects and plunged into the problem of creating an\nencephalograph that would record the infinitesimal irregularities that\nwere superimposed upon the great waves. Their operation became large;\nthey bought the old structure on top of the hill and moved in, bag and\nbaggage. They cohabited but did not live together for almost a year;\nPaul Brennan finally pointed out that Organized Society might permit a\ncouple of geniuses to become research hermits, but Organized Society\nstill took a dim view of cohabitation without a license. Besides, such\nmessy arrangements always cluttered up the legal clarity of chattels,\ntitles, and estates.\n\nThey married in a quiet ceremony about two years prior to the date that\nLouis Holden first identified the fine-line wave-shapes that went with\ndetermined ideas. When he recorded them and played them back, his brain\nre-traced its original line of thought, and he could not even make a\nmental revision of the way his thoughts were arranged. For two years\nLouis and Laura Holden picked their way slowly through this field;\nstumped at one point for several months because the machine was strictly\na personal proposition. Recorded by one of them, the playback was clear\nto that one, but to the other it was wild gibberish--an inexplicable\ntangle of noise and colored shapes, odors and tastes both pleasant and\nnasty, and mingled sensations. It was five years after their marriage\nbefore they found success by engraving information in the brain by\nsitting, connected to the machine, and reading aloud, word for word, the\ninformation that they wanted.\n\nIt went by rote, as they had learned in childhood. It was the tiresome\nrepetition of going over and over and over the lines of a poem or the\nnumbers of the multiplication table until the pathway was a deeply\ntrodden furrow in the brain. Forever imprinted, it was retained until\ndeath. Knowledge is stored by rote.\n\nTo accomplish this end, Louis Holden succeeded in violating all of the\ntheories of instrumentation by developing a circuit that acted as a sort\nof reverberation chamber which returned the wave-shape played into it\nback to the same terminals without interference, and this single circuit\nbecame the very heart of the Holden Electromechanical Educator.\n\nWith success under way, the Holdens needed an intellectual guinea pig, a\nvirgin mind, an empty store-house to fill with knowledge. They planned a\ntwenty-year program of research, to end by handing their machine to the\nworld complete with its product and instructions for its use and a list\nof pitfalls to avoid.\n\nThe conception of James Quincy Holden was a most carefully-planned\nparenthood. It was not accomplished without love or passion. Love had\ncome quietly, locking them together physically as they had been bonded\nintellectually. The passion had been deliberately provoked during the\nproper moment of Laura Holden's cycle of ovulation. This scientific\napproach to procreation was no experiment, it was the foregone-conclusive\nact to produce a component absolutely necessary for the completion of\ntheir long program of research. They happily left to Nature's Choice the\none factor they could not control, and planned to accept an infant of\neither sex with equal welcome. They loved their little boy as they loved\none another, rejoiced with him, despaired with him, and made their own\nway with success and mistake, and succeeded in bringing Jimmy to five\nyears of age quite normal except for his education.\n\nNow, proficiency in brain surgery does not come at an early age, nor does\nworld-wide fame in the field of delicate instrumentation. Jimmy's parents\nwere over forty-five on the date of his birth.\n\nJimmy's grandparents were, then, understandably aged seventy-eight and\neighty-one.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe old couple had seen their life, and they knew it for what it was.\nThey arose each morning and faced the day knowing that there would be no\nnew problem, only recurrence of some problem long solved. Theirs was a\ncomfortable routine, long gone was their spirit of adventure, the\npleasant notions of trying something a new and different way. At their\nage, they were content to take the easiest and the simplest way of doing\nwhat they thought to be Right. Furthermore, they had lived long enough to\nknow that no equitable decision can be made by listening to only one side\nof any argument.\n\nWhile young Jimmy was polishing off a platter of scrambled eggs the\nfollowing morning, Paul Brennan arrived. Jimmy's fork stopped in midair\nat the sound of Brennan's voice in the parlor.\n\n\"You called him,\" he said accusingly.\n\nGrandmother Holden said, \"He's your legal guardian, James.\"\n\n\"But--I don't--can't--\"\n\n\"Now, James, your father and mother knew best.\"\n\n\"But they didn't know about Paul Brennan. I won't go!\"\n\n\"You must.\"\n\n\"I won't!\"\n\n\"James,\" said Grandmother Holden quietly, \"you can't stay here.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"We're not prepared to keep you.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\nGrandmother Holden despaired. How could she make this youngster\nunderstand that eighty is not an age at which to embark upon the process\nof raising a five-year-old to maturity?\n\nFrom the other room, Paul Brennan was explaining his side as he'd given\nit to the police. \"--Forgot the land option that had to be signed. So I\ntook off after them and drove fast enough to catch up. I was only a\ncouple of hundred yards behind when it happened.\"\n\n\"He's a liar!\" cried Jimmy Holden.\n\n\"That's not a nice thing to say.\"\n\n\"It's true!\"\n\n\"Jimmy!\" came the reproachful tone.\n\n\"It's true!\" he cried.\n\nHis grandfather and Paul Brennan came into the kitchen. \"Ah, Jimmy,\"\nsaid Paul in a soothing voice, \"why did you run off? You had everybody\nworried.\"\n\n\"You did! You lie! You--\"\n\n\"James!\" snapped his grandfather. \"Stop that talk at once!\"\n\n\"Be easy with him, Mr. Holden. He's upset. Jimmy, let's get this settled\nright now. What did I do and how do I lie?\"\n\n\"Oh, please Mr. Brennan,\" said his grandmother. \"This isn't necessary.\"\n\n\"Oh, but it is. It is very important. As the legal guardian of young\nJames, I can't have him harboring some suspicion as deep as this. Come\non, Jimmy. Let's talk it out right now. What did I do and how am I\nlying?\"\n\n\"You weren't behind. You forced us off the road.\"\n\n\"How could he, young man?\" demanded Grandfather Holden.\n\n\"I don't know, but he did.\"\n\n\"Wait a moment, sir,\" said Brennan quietly. \"It isn't going to be enough\nto force him into agreement. He's got to see the truth for itself, of his\nown construction from the facts. Now, Jimmy, where was I when you left my\napartment?\"\n\n\"You--you were there.\"\n\n\"And didn't I say--\"\n\n\"One moment,\" said Grandfather Holden. \"Don't lead the witness.\"\n\n\"Sorry. James, what did I do?\"\n\n\"You--\" then a long pause.\n\n\"Come on, Jimmy.\"\n\n\"You shook hands with my father.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"Then you--kissed my mother on the cheek.\"\n\n\"And then, again?\"\n\n\"And then you carried my birthday presents down and put them in the car.\"\n\n\"Now, Jimmy, how does your father drive? Fast or slow?\"\n\n\"Fast.\"\n\n\"So now, young man, you tell me how I could go back up to my apartment,\nget my coat and hat, get my car out of the garage, and race to the top of\nthat hill so that I could turn around and come at you around that curve?\nJust tell me that, young man.\"\n\n\"I--don't know--how you did it.\"\n\n\"It doesn't make sense, does it?\"\n\n\"--No--\"\n\n\"Jimmy, I'm trying to help you. Your father and I were fraternity\nbrothers in college. I was best man at your parents' wedding. I am your\ngodfather. Your folks were taken away from both of us--and I'm hoping to\ntake care of you as if you were mine.\" He turned to Jimmy's grandparents.\n\"I wish to God that I could find the driver of that other car. He didn't\nhit anybody, but he's as guilty of a hit-and-run offence as the man who\ndoes. If I ever find him, I'll have him in jail until he rots!\"\n\n\"Jimmy,\" pleaded his grandmother, \"can't you see? Mr. Brennan is only\ntrying to help. Why would he do the evil thing you say he did?\"\n\n\"Because--\" and Jimmy started to cry. The utter futility of trying to\nmake people believe was too much to bear.\n\n\"Jimmy, please stop it and be a man,\" said Brennan. He put a hand on\nJimmy's shoulder. Jimmy flung it aside with a quick twist and a turn.\n\"Please, Jimmy,\" pleaded Brennan. Jimmy left his chair and buried his\nface in a corner of the wall.\n\n\"Jimmy, believe me,\" pleaded Brennan. \"I'm going to take you to live in\nyour old house, among your own things. I can't replace your folks, but I\ncan try to be as close to your father as I know how. I'll see you through\neverything, just as your mother and father want me to.\"\n\n\"No!\" exploded Jimmy through a burst of tears.\n\nGrandfather Holden grunted. \"This is getting close to the tantrum stage,\"\nhe said. \"And the only way to deal with a tantrum is to apply the flat of\nthe hand to the round of the bottom.\"\n\n\"Please,\" smiled Brennan. \"He's a pretty shaken youngster. He's\nemotionally hurt and frightened, and he wants to strike out and hurt\nsomething back.\"\n\n\"I think he's done enough of that,\" said Grandfather Holden. \"When Louis\ntossed one of these fits of temper where he wouldn't listen to any\nreason, we did as we saw fit anyway and let him kick and scream until\nhe got tired of the noise he made.\"\n\n\"Let's not be rough,\" pleaded Jimmy's grandmother. \"He's just a little\nboy, you know.\"\n\n\"If he weren't so little he'd have better sense,\" snapped Grandfather.\n\n\"James,\" said Paul Brennan quietly, \"do you see you're making trouble for\nyour grandparents? Haven't we enough trouble as it is? Now, young man,\nfor the last time, will you walk or will you be carried? Whichever,\nJimmy, we're going back home!\"\n\nJames Holden gave up. \"I'll go,\" he said bitterly, \"but I hate you.\"\n\n\"He'll be all right,\" promised Brennan. \"I swear it!\"\n\n\"Please, Jimmy, be good for Mr. Brennan,\" pleaded his grandmother. \"After\nall, it's for your own good.\" Jimmy turned away, bewildered, hurt and\nsilent. He stubbornly refused to say goodbye to his grandparents.\n\nHe was trapped in the world of grown-ups that believed a lying adult\nbefore they would even consider the truth of a child.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\n\nThe drive home was a bitter experience. Jimmy was sullen, and very quiet.\nHe refused to answer any question and he made no reply to any statement.\nPaul Brennan kept up a running chatter of pleasantries, of promises and\nplans for their future, and just enough grief to make it sound honest.\nHad Paul Brennan actually been as honest as his honeyed tones said he\nwas, no one could have continued to accuse him. But no one is more\ndifficult to fool than a child--even a normal child. Paul Brennan's\nprotestations simply made Jimmy Holden bitter.\n\nHe sat silent and unhappy in the far corner of the front seat all the way\nhome. In his mind was a nameless threat, a dread of what would come once\nthey were inside--either inside of Paul Brennan's apartment or inside of\nhis own home--with the door locked against the outside world.\n\nBut when they arrived, Paul Brennan continued his sympathetic attitude.\nTo Jimmy it was sheer hypocrisy; he was not experienced enough to know\nthat a person can commit an act and then convince himself that he hadn't.\n\n\"Jimmy,\" said Brennan softly, \"I have not the faintest notion of\npunishment. None whatsoever. You ruined your father's great invention.\nYou did that because you thought it was right. Someday when you change\nyour mind and come to believe in me, I'll ask you to replace it because I\nknow you can. But understand me, young man, I shall not ask you until you\nmake the first suggestion yourself!\"\n\nJimmy remained silent.\n\n\"One more thing,\" said Brennan firmly. \"Don't try that stunt with the\nletter to the station agent again. It won't work twice. Not in this town\nnor any other for a long, long time. I've made a sort of family-news item\nout of it which hit a lot of daily papers. It'll also be in the company\npapers of all the railroads and buslines, how Mr. What's-his-name at the\nMidland Railroad got suckered by a five-year-old running away from home.\nUnderstand?\"\n\nJimmy understood but made no sign.\n\n\"Then in September we'll start you in school,\" said Brennan.\n\nThis statement made no impression upon young James Holden whatsoever. He\nhad no intention of enduring this smothering by overkindness any longer\nthan it took him to figure out how to run away, and where to run to. It\nwas going to be a difficult thing. Cruel treatment, torture, physical\nharm were one thing; this act of being a deeply-concerned guardian was\nsomething else. A twisted arm he could complain about, a bruise he could\nshow, the scars of lashing would give credence to his tale. But who would\nlisten to any complaint about too much kindness?\n\nSix months of this sort of treatment and Jimmy Holden himself would begin\nto believe that his parents were monsters, coldly stuffing information in\nthe head of an infant instead of letting him grow through a normal\nchildhood. A year, and Jimmy Holden would be re-creating his father's\nreverberation circuit out of sheer gratitude. He'd be cajoled into\nsigning his own death-warrant.\n\nBut where can a five-year-old hide? There was no appeal to the forces of\nlaw and order. They would merely pop him into a squad car and deliver him\nto his guardian.\n\nLaw and order were out. His only chance was to lose himself in some gray\nhinterland where there were so many of his own age that no one could keep\ntrack of them all. Whether he would succeed was questionable. But until\nhe tried, he wouldn't know, and Jimmy was desperate enough to try\nanything.\n\nHe attended the funeral services with Paul Brennan. But while the pastor\nwas invoking Our Heavenly Father to accept the loving parents of orphaned\nJames, James the son left the side of his \"Uncle\" Paul Brennan, who knelt\nin false piety with his eyes closed.\n\nJimmy Holden had with him only his clothing and what was left of the wad\nof paper money from his father's cashbox still pinned to the inside of\nhis shirt.\n\nThis time Jimmy did not ride in style. Burlap sacks covered him when\nnight fell; they dirtied his clothing and the bottom of the freight car\nscuffed his shoes. For eighteen hours he hid in the jolting darkness, not\nknowing and caring less where he was going, so long as it was away!\n\nHe was hungry and thirsty by the time the train first began to slow down.\nIt was morning--somewhere. Jimmy looked furtively out of the slit at the\nedge of the door to see that the train was passing through a region of\ncottages dusted black by smoke, through areas of warehouse and factory,\nthrough squalor and filth and slum; and vacant lots where the spread of\nthe blight area had been so fast that the outward improvement had not\ntime to build. Eventually the scene changed to solid areas of railroad\ntrack, and the trains parked there thickened until he could no longer\nsee the city through them.\n\nUltimately the train stopped long enough for Jimmy to squeeze out through\nthe slit at the edge of the door.\n\nThe train went on and Jimmy was alone in the middle of some huge city.\nHe walked the noisome sidewalk trying to decide what he should do next.\nFood was of high importance, but how could he get it without attracting\nattention to himself? He did not know. But finally he reasoned that a\nhot dog wagon would probably take cash from a youngster without asking\nembarrassing questions, so long as the cash wasn't anything larger than\na five-dollar bill.\n\nHe entered the next one he came to. It was dirty; the windows held\nseveral years' accumulation of cooking grease, but the aroma was terrific\nto a young animal who'd been without food since yesterday afternoon.\n\nThe counterman did not like kids, but he put away his dislike at the\nsight of Jimmy's money. He grunted when Jimmy requested a dog, tossed one\non the grill and went back to reading his newspaper until some inner\nsense told him it was cooked. Jimmy finished it still hungry and asked\nfor another. He finished a third and washed down the whole mass with a\ntall glass of highly watered orange juice. The counterman took his money\nand was very careful about making the right change; if this dirty kid had\nswiped the five-spot, it could be the counterman's problem of explaining\nto someone why he had overcharged. Jimmy's intelligence told him that\ncountermen in a joint like this didn't expect tips, so he saved himself\nthat hurdle. He left the place with a stomach full of food that only the\nindestructible stomach of a five-year-old could handle and now, fed and\nreasonably content, Jimmy began to seek his next point of contact.\n\nHe had never been in a big city before. The sheer number of human beings\nthat crowded the streets surpassed his expectations. The traffic was not\npersonally terrifying, but it was so thick that Jimmy Holden wondered how\npeople drove without colliding. He knew about traffic lights and walked\nwith the green, staying out of trouble. He saw groups of small children\nplaying in the streets and in the empty lots. Those not much older than\nhimself were attending school.\n\nHe paused to watch a group of children his own age trying to play\nbaseball with a ragged tennis ball and the handle from a broom. It was a\nhelter-skelter game that made no pattern but provided a lot of fun and\nscreaming. He was quite bothered by a quarrel that came up; two of his\nown age went at one another with tiny fists flying, using words that\nJimmy hadn't learned from his father's machine.\n\nHe wondered how he might join them in their game. But they paid him no\nattention, so he didn't try.\n\nAt lunchtime Jimmy consumed another collection of hot dogs. He continued\nto meander aimlessly through the city until schooltime ended, then he saw\nthe streets and vacant lots fill with older children playing games with\nmore pattern to them. It was a new world he watched, a world that had not\nbeen a part of his education. The information he owned was that of the\nschool curriculum; it held nothing of the daily business of growing up.\nHe knew the general rules of big-league baseball, but the kid-business of\nstickball did not register.\n\nHe was at a complete loss. It was sheer chance and his own tremendous\ncuriosity that led him to the edge of a small group that were busily\nengaged in the odd process of trying to jack up the front of a car.\n\nIt wasn't a very good jack; it should have had the weight of a full adult\nagainst the handle. The kids strained and put their weight on the jack,\nbut the handle wouldn't budge though their feet were off the ground.\n\nHere was the place where academic information would be useful--and the\nchance for an \"in.\" Jimmy shoved himself into the small group and said,\n\"Get a longer handle.\"\n\nThey turned on him suspiciously.\n\n\"Whatcha know about it?\" demanded one, shoving his chin out.\n\n\"Get a longer handle,\" repeated Jimmy. \"Go ahead, get one.\"\n\n\"G'wan--\"\n\n\"Wait, Moe. Maybe--\"\n\n\"Who's he?\"\n\n\"I'm Jimmy.\"\n\n\"Jimmy who?\"\n\n\"Jimmy--James.\" Academic information came up again. \"Jimmy. Like the\njimmy you use on a window.\"\n\n\"Jimmy James. Any relation to Jesse James?\"\n\nJames Quincy Holden now told his first whopper. \"I,\" he said, \"am his\ngrandson.\"\n\nThe one called Moe turned to one of the younger ones. \"Get a longer\nhandle,\" he said.\n\nWhile the younger one went for something to use as a longer handle, Moe\ninvited Jimmy to sit on the curb. \"Cigarette?\" invited Moe.\n\n\"I don't smoke,\" said Jimmy.\n\n\"Sissy?\"\n\nAdolescent-age information looking out through five-year-old eyes assayed\nMoe. Moe was about eight, maybe even nine; taller than Jimmy but no\nheavier. He had a longer reach, which was an advantage that Jimmy did not\ncare to hazard. There was no sure way to establish physical superiority;\nJimmy was uncertain whether any show of intellect would be welcome.\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"I'm no sissy. I don't like 'em.\"\n\nMoe lit a cigarette and smoked with much gesturing and flickings of ashes\nand spitting at a spot on the pavement. He was finished when the younger\none came back with a length of water pipe that would fit over the handle\nof the jack.\n\nThe car went up with ease. Then came the business of removing the hubcap\nand the struggle to loose the lugbolts. Jimmy again suggested the\napplication of the length of pipe. The wheel came off.\n\n\"C'mon, Jimmy,\" said Moe. \"We'll cut you in.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" nodded Jimmy Holden, willing to see what came next so long as it\ndid not have anything to do with Paul Brennan. Moe trundled the car wheel\ndown the street, steering it with practiced hands. A block down and a\nblock around that corner, a man with a three-day growth of whiskers\nstopped a truck with a very dirty license plate. Moe stopped and the\nman jumped out of the truck long enough to heave the tire and wheel into\nthe back.\n\nThe man gave Moe a handful of change which Moe distributed among the\nlittle gang. Then he got in the truck beside the driver and waved for\nJimmy to come along.\n\n\"What's that for?\" demanded the driver.\n\n\"He's a smarty pants,\" said Moe. \"A real good one.\"\n\n\"Who're you?\"\n\n\"Jimmy--James.\"\n\n\"What'cha do, kid?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Moe, what did this kid sell you?\"\n\n\"You and your rusty jacks,\" grunted Moe. \"Jimmy James here told us how to\nput a long hunk of pipe on the handle.\"\n\n\"Jimmy James, who taught you about leverage?\" demanded the driver\nsuspiciously.\n\nJimmy Holden believed that he was in the presence of an educated man.\n\"Archimedes,\" he said solemnly, giving it the proper pronunciation.\n\nThe driver said to Moe, \"Think he's all right?\"\n\n\"He's smart enough.\"\n\n\"Who're your parents, kid?\"\n\nJimmy Holden realized that this was a fine time to tell the truth, but\nproperly diluted to taste. \"My folks are dead,\" he said.\n\n\"Who you staying with?\"\n\n\"No one.\"\n\nThe driver of the truck eyed him cautiously for a moment. \"You escaped\nfrom an orphan asylum?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" lied Jimmy.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Ain't saying.\"\n\n\"Wise, huh?\"\n\n\"Don't want to get sent back,\" said Jimmy.\n\n\"Got a flop?\"\n\n\"Flop?\"\n\n\"Place to sleep for the night.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Where'd you sleep last night?\"\n\n\"Boxcar.\"\n\n\"Bindlestiff, huh?\" roared the man with laughter.\n\n\"No, sir,\" said Jimmy. \"I've no bindle.\"\n\nThe man's roar of laughter stopped abruptly. \"You're a pretty wise kid,\"\nhe said thoughtfully.\n\n\"I told y' so,\" said Moe.\n\n\"Shut up,\" snapped the man. \"Kid, do you want a flop for the night?\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\n\"Okay. You're in.\"\n\n\"What's your name?\" asked Jimmy.\n\n\"You call me Jake. Short for Jacob. Er--here's the place.\"\n\nThe \"Place\" had no other name. It was a junkyard. In it were car parts,\nwrecks with parts undamaged, whole motors rusting in the air, axles,\nwheels, differential assemblies and transmissions from a thousand cars of\na thousand different parentages. Hubcaps abounded in piles sorted to size\nand shape. Jake drove the little pickup truck into an open shed. The tire\nand wheel came from the back and went immediately into place on a\ncomplicated gadget. In a couple of minutes, the tire was off the wheel\nand the inner tube was out of the casing. Wheel, casing, and inner tube\nall went into three separate storage piles.\n\nNot only a junkyard, but a stripper's paradise. Bring a hot car in here\nand in a few hours no one could find it. Its separated parts would be\nsold piece by piece and week by week as second-hand replacements.\n\nJake said, \"Dollar-fifty.\"\n\n\"Two,\" said Moe.\n\n\"One seventy-five.\"\n\n\"Two.\"\n\n\"Go find it and put it back.\"\n\n\"Gimme the buck-six,\" grunted Moe. \"Pretty cheap for a good shoe, a\nwheel, and a sausage.\"\n\n\"Bring it in alone next time, and I'll slip you two-fifty. That gang you\nuse costs, too. Now scram, Jimmy James and I got business to talk over.\"\n\n\"He taking over?\"\n\n\"Don't talk stupid. I need a spotter. You're too old, Moe. And if he's\nany good, you gotta promotion coming.\"\n\n\"And if he ain't?\"\n\n\"Don't come back!\"\n\nMoe eyed Jimmy Holden. \"Make it good--Jimmy.\" There was malice in Moe's\nface.\n\nJake looked down at Jimmy Holden. With precisely the same experienced\ntechnique he used to estimate the value of a car loaded with road dirt,\nrust, and collision-smashed fenders, Jake stripped the child of the\ndirty clothing, the scuffed shoes, the mussed hair, and saw through to\nthe value beneath. Its price was one thousand dollars, offered with no\nquestions asked for information that would lead to the return of one\nJames Quincy Holden to his legal guardian.\n\nIt wasn't magic on Jake's part. Paul Brennan had instantly offered a\nreward. And Jake made it his business to keep aware of such matters.\n\nHow soon, wondered Jake, might the ante be raised to two Gee? Five? And\nin the meantime, if things panned, Jimmy could be useful as a spotter.\n\n\"You afraid of that Moe punk, Jimmy?\"\n\n\"No sir.\"\n\n\"Good, but keep an eye on him. He'd sell his mother for fifty cents clear\nprofit--seventy-five if he had to split the deal. Now, kid, do you know\nanything about spotting?\"\n\n\"No sir.\"\n\n\"Hungry?\"\n\n\"Yes sir.\"\n\n\"All right. Come on in and we'll eat. Do you like Mulligan?\"\n\n\"Yes sir.\"\n\n\"Good. You and me are going to get along.\"\n\nInside of the squalid shack, Jake had a cozy set-up. The filth that he\nencouraged out in the junkyard was not tolerated inside his shack. The\ndividing line was halfway across the edge of the door; the inside was as\nclean, neat, and shining as the outside was squalid.\n\n\"You'll sleep here,\" said Jake, waving towards a small bedroom with a\nsingle twin bunk. \"You'll make yer own bed and take a shower every\nnight--or out! Understand?\"\n\n\"Yes sir.\"\n\n\"Good. Now, let's have chow, and I'll tell you about this spotting\nbusiness. You help me, and I'll help you. One blab and back you go to\nwhere you came from. Get it?\"\n\n\"Yes sir.\"\n\nAnd so, while the police of a dozen cities were scouring their beats for\na homeless, frightened five-year-old, Jimmy Holden slept in a comfortable\nbed in a clean room, absolutely disguised by an exterior that looked like\nan abandoned manure shed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\n\nJimmy discovered that he was admirably suited to the business of\nspotting. The \"job turnover\" was high because the spotter must be young\nenough to be allowed the freedom of the preschool age, yet be mature\nenough to follow orders.\n\nThe job consisted of meandering through the streets of the city, in\nthe aimless patterns of youth, while keeping an eye open for parked\nautomobiles with the ignition keys still in their locks.\n\nOnly a very young child can go whooping through the streets bumping\npedestrians, running wildly, or walking from car to car twiggling each\ndoor handle and peering inside as if he were imitating a door-to-door\nsalesman, occasionally making a minor excursion in one shop door and out\nthe other.\n\nHe takes little risk. He merely spots the target. He reports that there\nis such-and-such a car parked so-and-so, after which he goes on to spot\nthe next target. The rest of the business is up to the men who do the\nactual stealing.\n\nJimmy's job-training program took only one morning. That same afternoon\nhe went to work for Jake's crew.\n\nJake's experience with kids had been no more than so-so promising. He\nused them because they were better than nothing. He did not expect them\nto stay long; they were gobbled up by the rules of compulsory education\njust about the age when they could be counted upon to follow orders.\n\nHe felt about the same with Jimmy Holden; the \"missing person\" report\nstated that one of the most prominent factors in the lad's positive\nidentification was his high quality of speech and his superior\nintelligence. (This far Paul Brennan had to go, and he had divulged\nthe information with great reluctance.)\n\nBut though Jake needed a preschool child with intelligence, he did not\nrealize the height of Jimmy Holden's.\n\nIt was obvious to Jimmy on the second day that Jake's crew was not taking\nadvantage of every car spotted. One of them had been a \"natural\" to\nJimmy's way of thinking. He asked Jake about it: \"Why didn't you take the\nsea-green Ford in front of the corner store?\"\n\n\"Too risky.\"\n\n\"Risky?\"\n\nJake nodded. \"Spotting isn't risky, Jimmy. But picking the car up is.\nThere is a very dangerous time when the driver is a sitting duck. From\nthe moment he opens the car door he is in danger. Sitting in the chance\nof getting caught, he must start the car, move it out of the parking\nspace into traffic, and get under way and gone before he is safe.\"\n\n\"But the sea-green Ford was sitting there with its engine running!\"\n\n\"Meaning,\" nodded Jake, \"that the driver pulled in and made a fast dash\ninto the store for a newspaper or a pack of cigarettes.\"\n\n\"I understand. Your man could get caught. Or,\" added Jimmy thoughtfully,\n\"the owner might even take his car away before we got there.\"\n\nJake nodded. This one was going to make it easy for him.\n\nAs the days wore on, Jimmy became more selective. He saw no point in\nreporting a car that wasn't going to be used. An easy mark wedged between\ntwo other cars couldn't be removed with ease. A car parked in front of a\nparking meter with a red flag was dangerous, it meant that the time was\nup and the driver should be getting nervous about it. A man who came\nshopping along the street to find a meter with some time left by the\nformer driver was obviously looking for a quick-stop place--whereas the\nman who fed the meter to its limit was a much better bet.\n\nJake, thankful for what Fate had brought him, now added refinements of\neducation. Cars parked in front of supermarkets weren't safe; the owner\nmight be standing just inside the big plate glass window. The car parked\nhurriedly just before the opening of business was likely to be a good bet\nbecause people are careless about details when they are hurrying to punch\nthe old time clock.\n\nJake even closed down his operations during the calculated danger\nperiods, but he made sure to tell Jimmy Holden why.\n\nFrom school-closing to dinnertime Jimmy was allowed to do as he pleased.\nHe found it hard to enjoy playing with his contemporaries, and Jake's\nexplanation about dangerous times warned Jimmy against joining Moe and\nhis little crew of thieves. Jimmy would have enjoyed helping in the\nstripping yard, but he had not the heft for it. They gave him little\nmessy jobs to do that grimed his hands and made Jake's stern rule of\ncleanliness hard to achieve. Jimmy found it easier to avoid such jobs\nthan to scrub his skin raw.\n\nOne activity he found to his ability was the cooking business.\n\nJake was a stew-man, a soup-man, a slum-gullion man. The fellows who\nroamed in and out of Jake's Place dipped their plate of slum from the\npot and their chunk of bread from the loaf and talked all through this\nnever-started and never-ended lunch. With the delicacy of his \"inside\"\nlife, Jake knew the value of herbs and spices and he was a hard\ntaskmaster. But inevitably, Jimmy learned the routine of brewing a bucket\nof slum that suited Jake's taste, after which Jimmy was now and then\npermitted to take on the more demanding job of cooking the steaks and\nchops that made their final evening meal.\n\nJimmy applied himself well, for the knowledge was going to be handy. More\nimportant, it kept him from the jobs that grimed his hands.\n\nHe sought other pursuits, but Jake had never had a resident spotter\nbefore and the play-facilities provided were few. Jimmy took to\nreading--necessarily, the books that Jake read, that is, approximately\nequal parts of science fiction and girlie-girlie books. The science\nfiction he enjoyed; but he was not able to understand why he wasn't\ninterested in the girlie books. So Jimmy read. Jake even went out of his\nway to find more science fiction for the lad.\n\nUltimately, Jimmy located a potential source of pleasure.\n\nHe spotted a car with a portable typewriter on the back seat. The car was\nlocked and therefore no target, but it stirred his fancy. Thereafter he\nadded a contingent requirement to his spotting. A car with a typewriter\nwas more desirable than one without.\n\nJimmy went on to further astound Jake by making a list of what the\ncustomers were buying. After that he concentrated on spotting those cars\nthat would provide the fastest sale for their parts.\n\nIt was only a matter of time; Jimmy spotted a car with a portable\ntypewriter. It was not as safe a take as his others, but he reported it.\nJake's driver picked it up and got it out in a squeak; the car itself\nturned up to be no great find.\n\nJimmy claimed the typewriter at once.\n\nJake objected: \"No dice, Jimmy.\"\n\n\"I want it, Jake.\"\n\n\"Look, kid, I can sell it for twenty.\"\n\n\"But I want it.\"\n\nJake eyed Jimmy thoughtfully, and he saw two things. One was a\nthousand-dollar reward standing before him. The other was a row of prison\nbars.\n\nJake could only collect one and avoid the other by being very sure that\nJimmy Holden remained grateful to Jake for Jake's shelter and protection.\n\nHe laughed roughly. \"All right, Jimmy,\" he said. \"You lift it and you can\nhave it.\"\n\nJimmy struggled with the typewriter, and succeeded only because it was a\nnew one made of the titanium-magnesium-aluminum alloys. It hung between\nhis little knees, almost--but not quite--touching the ground.\n\n\"You have it,\" said Jake. He lifted it lightly and carried it into the\nboy's little bedroom.\n\nJimmy started after dinner. He picked out the letters with the same\npainful search he'd used in typing his getaway letter. He made the\nsame mistakes he'd made before. It had taken him almost an hour and\nnearly fifty sheets of paper to compose that first note without an\nerror; that was no way to run a railroad; now Jimmy was determined\nto learn the proper operation of this machine. But finally the jagged\ntack-tack--pause--tack-tack got on Jake's nerves.\n\nJake came in angrily. \"You're wasting paper,\" he snapped. He eyed Jimmy\nthoughtfully. \"How come with your education you don't know how to type?\"\n\n\"My father wouldn't let me.\"\n\n\"Seems your father wouldn't let you do anything.\"\n\n\"He said that I couldn't learn until I was old enough to learn properly.\nHe said I must not get into the habit of using the hunt-and-peck system,\nor I'd never get out of it.\"\n\n\"So what are you doing now?\"\n\n\"My father is dead.\"\n\n\"And anything he said before doesn't count any more?\"\n\n\"He promised me that he'd start teaching me as soon as my hands were big\nenough,\" said Jimmy soberly. \"But he isn't here any more. So I've got to\nlearn my own way.\"\n\nJake reflected. Jimmy was a superior spotter. He was also a potential\ndanger; the other kids played it as a game and didn't really realize what\nthey were doing. This one knew precisely what he was doing, knew that it\nwas wrong, and had the lucidity of speech to explain in full detail. It\nwas a good idea to keep him content.\n\n\"If you'll stop that tap-tapping for tonight,\" promised Jake, \"I'll get\nyou a book tomorrow. Is it a deal?\"\n\n\"You will?\"\n\n\"I will if you'll follow it.\"\n\n\"Sure thing.\"\n\n\"And,\" said Jake, pushing his advantage, \"you'll do it with the door\nclosed so's I can hear this TV set.\"\n\n\"Yes sir.\"\n\nJake kept his word.\n\nOn the following afternoon, not only was Jimmy presented with one of the\nstandard learn-it-yourself books on touch-typing, but Jake also contrived\na sturdy desk out of one old packing case and a miniature chair out of\nanother. Both articles of home-brewed furniture Jake insisted upon having\npainted before he permitted them inside his odd dwelling, and that\ndelayed Jimmy one more day.\n\nBut it was only one more day; and then a new era of experience began for\nJimmy.\n\nIt would be nice to report that he went at it with determination,\nself-discipline, and system, following instructions to the letter and\nemerging a first-rate typist.\n\nSorry. Jimmy hated every minute of it. He galled at the pages and pages\nof _juj juj juj frf frf frf_. He cried with frustration because he could\nnot perform the simple exercise to perfection. He skipped through the\nbook so close to complete failure that he hurled it across the room, and\ncried in anger because he had not the strength to throw the typewriter\nafter it. Throw the machine? He had not the strength in his pinky to\npress the carriage-shift key!\n\nPart of his difficulty was the size of his hands, of course. But most of\nhis trouble lay deep-seated in his recollection of his parents' fabulous\nmachine. It would have made a typist of him in a single half-hour\nsession, or so he thought.\n\nHe had yet to learn about the vast gulf that lies between theory and\npractice.\n\nIt took Jimmy several weeks of aimless fiddling before he realized that\nthere was no easy short-cut. Then he went back to the _juj juj juj frf\nfrf frf_ routine and hated it just as much, but went on.\n\nHe invented a kind of home-study \"hooky\" to break the monotony. He would\nrun off a couple of pages of regular exercise, and then turn back to the\nhunt-and-peck system of typing to work on a story. He took a furtive glee\nin this; he felt that he was getting away with something. In mid-July,\nJake caught him at it.\n\n\"What's going on?\" demanded Jake, waving the pages of manuscript copy.\n\n\"Typing,\" said Jimmy.\n\nJake picked up the typing guidebook and waved it under Jimmy's nose.\n\"Show me where it says you gotta type anything like, 'Captain Brandon\nstruggled against his chains when he heard Lady Hamilton scream. The\npirate's evil laugh rang through the ship. \"Curse you--\"'\"\n\nJake snorted.\n\n\"But--\" said Jimmy faintly.\n\n\"But nothing!\" snapped Jake. \"Stop the drivel and learn that thing! You\nthink I let you keep the machine just to play games? We gotta find a way\nto make it pay off. Learn it good!\"\n\nHe stamped out, taking the manuscript with him. From that moment on,\nJimmy's furtive career as an author went on only when Jake was either out\nfor the evening or entertaining. In any case, he did not bother Jimmy\nfurther, evidently content to wait until Jimmy had \"learned it good\"\nbefore putting this new accomplishment to use. Nor did Jimmy bother him.\nIt was a satisfactory arrangement for the time being. Jimmy hid his\n\"work\" under a pile of raw paper and completed it in late August. Then,\nwith the brash assurance of youth, he packed and mailed his first\nfinished manuscript to the editor of _Boy's Magazine_.\n\nHis typing progressed more satisfactorily than he realized, even though\nhe was still running off page after page of repetitious exercise,\nleavened now and then by a page of idiotic sentences the letters of\nwhich were restricted to the center of the typewriter keyboard. The\npractice, even the hunt-and-peck relaxation from discipline, exercised\nthe small muscles. Increased strength brought increased accuracy.\n\nSeptember rolled in, the streets emptied of school-aged children and the\nout-of-state car licenses diminished to a trickle. With the end of the\ncarefree vacation days went the careless motorist.\n\nJake, whose motives were no more altruistic than his intentions were\nlegal, began to look for a means of disposing of Jimmy Holden at the\ngreatest profit to himself. Jake stalled only because he hoped that the\nreward might be stepped up.\n\nBut it was Jimmy's own operations that closed this chapter of his life.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FIVE\n\n\nJimmy had less scout work to do and no school to attend; he was too small\nto help in the sorting of car parts and too valuable to be tossed out. He\nwas in the way.\n\nSo he was in Jake's office when the mail came. He brought the bundle to\nJake's desk and sat on a box, sorting the circulars and catalogs from the\nfirst class. Halfway down the pile was a long envelope addressed to\n_Jimmy James_.\n\nHe dropped the rest with a little yelp. Jake eyed him quickly and\nsnatched the letter out of Jimmy's hands.\n\n\"Hey! That's mine!\" said Jimmy. Jake shoved him away.\n\n\"Who's writing you?\" demanded Jake.\n\n\"It's mine!\" cried Jimmy.\n\n\"Shut up!\" snapped Jake, unfolding the letter. \"I read _all_ the mail\nthat comes here first.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Shut your mouth and your teeth'll stay in,\" said Jake flatly. He\nseparated a green slip from the letter and held the two covered while he\nread. \"Well, well,\" he said. \"Our little Shakespeare!\" With a disdainful\ngrunt Jake tossed the letter to Jimmy.\n\nEagerly, Jimmy took the letter and read:\n\n  Dear Mr. James:\n\n  We regret the unconscionable length of time between your submission and\n  this reply. However, the fact that this reply is favorable may be its\n  own apology. We are enclosing a check for $20.00 with the following\n  explanation:\n\n  Our policy is to reject all work written in dialect. At the best we\n  request the author to rewrite the piece in proper English and frame\n  his effect by other means. Your little story is not dialect, nor is it\n  bad literarily, the framework's being (as it is) a fairly good example\n  of a small boy's relating in the first person one of his adventures,\n  using for the first time his father's typewriter. But you went too far.\n  I doubt that even a five-year-old would actually make as many\n  typographical errors.\n\n  However, we found the idea amusing, therefore our payment. One of our\n  editors will work your manuscript into less-erratic typescript for\n  eventual publication.\n\n  Please continue to think of us in the future, but don't corn up your\n  script with so many studied blunders.\n\n  Sincerely,\n  Joseph Brandon, editor,\n  Boy's Magazine.\n\n\"Gee,\" breathed Jimmy, \"a check!\"\n\nJake laughed roughly. \"Shakespeare,\" he roared. \"Don't corn up your\nstuff! You put too many errors in! Wow!\"\n\nJimmy's eyes began to burn. He had no defense against this sarcasm. He\nwanted praise for having accomplished something, instead of raucous\nlaughter.\n\n\"I wrote it,\" he said lamely.\n\n\"Oh, go away!\" roared Jake.\n\nJimmy reached for the check.\n\n\"Scram,\" said Jake, shutting his laughter off instantly.\n\n\"It's mine!\" cried Jimmy.\n\nJake paused, then laughed again. \"Okay, smart kid. Take it and spend it!\"\nHe handed the check to Jimmy Holden.\n\nJimmy took it quickly and left.\n\nHe wanted to eye it happily, to gloat over it, to turn it over and over\nand to read it again and again; but he wanted to do it in private.\n\nHe took it with him to the nearest bank, feeling its folded bulk and\nrunning a fingernail along the serrated edge.\n\nHe re-read it in the bank, then went to a teller's window. \"Can you cash\nthis, please?\" he asked.\n\nThe teller turned it over. \"It isn't endorsed.\"\n\n\"I can't reach the desk to sign it,\" complained Jimmy.\n\n\"Have you an account here?\" asked the teller politely.\n\n\"Well, no sir.\"\n\n\"Any identification?\"\n\n\"No--no sir,\" said Jimmy thoughtfully. Not a shred of anything did he\nhave to show who he was under either name.\n\n\"Who is this Jimmy James?\" asked the teller.\n\n\"Me. I am.\"\n\nThe teller smiled. \"And you wrote a short story that sold to _Boy's\nMagazine_?\" he asked with a lifted eyebrow. \"That's pretty good for a\nlittle guy like you.\"\n\n\"Yes sir.\"\n\nThe teller looked over Jimmy's head; Jimmy turned to look up at one of\nthe bank's policemen. \"Tom, what do you make of this?\"\n\nThe policeman shrugged. He stooped down to Jimmy's level. \"Where did you\nget this check, young fellow?\" he asked gently.\n\n\"It came in the mail this morning.\"\n\n\"You're Jimmy James?\"\n\n\"Yes sir.\" Jimmy Holden had been called that for more than half a year;\nhis assent was automatic.\n\n\"How old are you, young man?\" asked the policeman kindly.\n\n\"Five and a half.\"\n\n\"Isn't that a bit young to be writing stories?\"\n\nJimmy bit his lip. \"I wrote it, though.\"\n\nThe policeman looked up at the teller with a wink. \"He can tell a good\nyarn,\" chuckled the policeman. \"Shouldn't wonder if he could write one.\"\n\nThe teller laughed and Jimmy's eyes burned again. \"It's mine,\" he\ninsisted.\n\n\"If it's yours,\" said the policeman quietly, \"we can settle it fast\nenough. Do your folks have an account here?\"\n\n\"No sir.\"\n\n\"Hmmm. That makes it tough.\"\n\nBrightly, Jimmy asked, \"Can I open an account here?\"\n\n\"Why, sure you can,\" said the policeman. \"All you have to do is to bring\nyour parents in.\"\n\n\"But I want the money,\" wailed Jimmy.\n\n\"Jimmy James,\" explained the policeman with a slight frown to the teller,\n\"we can't cash a check without positive identification. Do you know what\npositive identification means?\"\n\n\"Yes sir. It means that you've got to be sure that this is me.\"\n\n\"Right! Now, those are the rules. Now, of course, you don't look like\nthe sort of young man who would tell a lie. I'll even bet your real\nname is Jimmy James, Jr. But you see, we have no proof, and our boss\nwill be awful mad at us if we break the rules and cash this check without\nfollowing the rules. The rules, Jimmy James, aren't to delay nice, honest\npeople, but to stop people from making mistakes. Mistakes such as taking\na little letter out of their father's mailbox. If we cashed that check,\nthen it couldn't be put back in father's mailbox without anybody knowing\nabout it. And that would be real bad.\"\n\n\"But it's mine!\"\n\n\"Sonny, if that's yours, all you have to do is to have your folks come in\nand say so. Then we'll open an account for you.\"\n\n\"Yes sir,\" said Jimmy in a voice that was thick with tears of frustration\nclose to the surface. He turned away and left.\n\nJake was still in the outside office of the Yard when Jimmy returned. The\nboy was crestfallen, frustrated, unhappy, and would not have returned at\nall if there had been another place where he was welcome. He expected\nridicule from Jake, but Jake smiled.\n\n\"No luck, kid?\"\n\nJimmy just shook his head.\n\n\"Checks are tough, Jimmy. Give up, now?\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"No? What then?\"\n\n\"I can write a letter and sign it,\" said Jimmy, explaining how he had\noutfoxed the ticket seller.\n\n\"Won't work with checks, Jimmy. For me now, if I was to be polite and\ndressed right they might cash a twenty if I showed up with my social\nsecurity card, driver's license, identification card with photograph\nsealed in, and all that junk. But a kid hasn't got a chance. Look, Jimmy,\nI'm sorry for this morning. To-morrow morning we'll go over to my bank\nand I'll have them cash it for you. It's yours. You earned it and you\nkeep it. Okay? Are we friends again?\"\n\n\"Yes sir.\"\n\nGravely they shook hands. \"Watch the place, kid,\" said Jake. \"I got to\nmake a phone call.\"\n\nIn the morning, Jake dressed for business and insisted that Jimmy put on\nhis best to make a good impression. After breakfast, they set out. Jake\nparked in front of a granite building.\n\n\"This isn't any bank,\" objected Jimmy. \"This is a police station.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" responded Jake. \"Here's where we get you an identification card.\nDon't you know?\"\n\n\"Okay,\" said Jimmy dubiously.\n\nInside the station there were a number of men in uniform and in plain\nclothing. Jake strode forward, holding Jimmy by one small hand. They\napproached the sergeant's desk and Jake lifted Jimmy up and seated him on\none edge of the desk with his feet dangling.\n\nThe sergeant looked at them with interest but without surprise.\n\n\"Sergeant,\" said Jake, \"this is Jimmy James--as he calls himself when\nhe's writing stories. Otherwise he is James Quincy Holden.\"\n\nJimmy went cold all over.\n\nJake backed through the circle that was closing in; the hole he made was\nfilled by Paul Brennan.\n\nIt was not the first betrayal in Jimmy James's young life, but it was\ntotally unexpected. He didn't know that the policeman from the bank had\nworried Jake; he didn't know that Jake had known all along who he was; he\ndidn't know how fast Brennan had moved after the phone call from Jake.\nBut his young mind leaped past the unknown facts to reach a certain, and\ncorrect, conclusion.\n\nHe had been sold out.\n\n\"Jimmy, Jimmy,\" came the old, pleading voice. \"Why did you run away?\nWhere have you been?\"\n\nBrennan stepped forward and placed a hand on the boy's shoulder. \"Without\na shadow of doubt,\" he said formally, \"this is James Quincy Holden. I so\nidentify him. And with no more ado, I hand you the reward.\" He reached\ninto his inside pocket and drew out an envelope, handing it to Jake. \"I\nhave never parted with one thousand dollars so happily in my life.\"\n\nJimmy watched, unable to move. Brennan was busy and cheerful, the model\nof the man whose long-lost ward has been returned to him.\n\n\"So, James, shall we go quietly or shall we have a scene?\"\n\nTrapped and sullen, Jimmy Holden said nothing. The officers helped him\ndown from the desk. He did not move. Brennan took him by a hand that was\nas limp as wet cloth. Brennan started for the door. The arm lifted until\nthe link was taut; then, with slow, dragging steps, James Quincy Holden\nstarted toward home.\n\nBrennan said, \"You understand me, don't you, Jimmy?\"\n\n\"You want my father's machine.\"\n\n\"Only to help you, Jimmy. Can't you believe that?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nBrennan drove his car with ease. A soft smile lurked around his lips. He\nwent on, \"You know what your father's machine will do for you, don't you,\nJimmy?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But have you ever attended school?\"\n\n\"No.\" But Jimmy remembered the long hours and hours of study and practice\nbefore he became proficient with his typewriter. For a moment he felt\nclose to tears. It had been the only possession he truly owned, now it\nwas gone. And with it was gone the author's first check. The thrill of\nthat first check is far greater than Graduation or the First Job. It is\napproximately equal to the flush of pride that comes when the author's\nstory hits print with his NAME appended.\n\nBut Jimmy's typewriter was gone, and his check was gone. Without a doubt\nthe check would turn up cashed--through the operations of Jake Caslow.\n\nBrennan's voice cut into his thoughts. \"You will attend school, Jimmy.\nYou'll have to.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Oh, now look, Jimmy. There are laws that say you must attend school.\nThe only way those laws can be avoided is to make an appeal to the law\nitself, and have your legal guardian--myself--ask for the privilege of\ntutoring you at home. Well, I won't do it.\"\n\nHe drove for a moment, thinking. \"So you're going to attend school,\" he\nsaid, \"and while you're there you're going to be careful not to disclose\nby any act or inference that you already know everything they can teach\nyou. Otherwise they will ask some embarrassing questions. And the first\nthing that happens to you is that you will be put in a much harder place\nto escape from than our home, Jimmy. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"Yes sir,\" the boy said sickly.\n\n\"But,\" purred Uncle Paul Brennan, \"you may find school very boring. If\nso, you have only to say the word--rebuild your father's machine--and go\non with your career.\"\n\n\"I w--\" Jimmy began automatically, but his uncle stopped him.\n\n\"You won't, no,\" he agreed. \"Not now. In the meantime, then, you will\nlive the life proper to your station--and your age. I won't deny you a\nsingle thing, Jimmy. Not a single thing that a five-year-old can want.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n\n\nPaul Brennan moved into the Holden house with Jimmy.\n\nJimmy had the run of the house--almost. Uncle Paul closed off the upper\nsitting room, which the late parents had converted into their laboratory.\n_That_ was locked. But the rest of the house was free, and Jimmy was once\nmore among the things he had never hoped to see again.\n\nBrennan's next step was to hire a middle-aged couple to take care of\nhouse and boy. Their name was Mitchell; they were childless and regretted\nit; they lavished on Jimmy the special love and care that comes only from\nchildless child-lovers.\n\nThough Jimmy was wary to the point of paranoia, he discovered that he\nwanted for nothing. He was kept clean and his home kept tidy. He was fed\nwell--not only in terms of nourishment, but in terms of what he liked.\n\nThen ... Jimmy began to notice changes.\n\n_Huckleberry Finn_ turned up missing. In its place on the shelf was a\ncollection of Little Golden Books.\n\nHis advanced Mecanno set was \"broken\"--so Mrs. Mitchell told him. Uncle\nPaul had accidentally crushed it. \"But you'll like this better,\" she\nbeamed, handing him a fresh new box from the toy store. It contained\nbright-colored modular blocks.\n\nJimmy's parents had given him canvasboard and oil paints; now they were\ngone. Jimmy would have admitted he was no artist; but he didn't enjoy\nretrogressing to his uncle's selection--finger paints.\n\nHis supply of drawing paper was not tampered with. But it was not\nreplaced. When it was gone, Jimmy was presented with a blackboard and\nboxes of colored chalk.\n\nBy Christmas every possession was gone--replaced--the new toys tailored\nto Jimmy's physical age. There was a Christmas tree, and under it a pile\nof gay bright boxes. Jimmy had hardly the heart to open them, for he knew\nwhat they would contain.\n\nHe was right.\n\nJimmy had everything that would keep a five-year-old boy\ncontented ... and not one iota more. He objected; his objections got him\nnowhere. Mrs. Mitchell was reproachful: Ingratitude, Jimmy! Mr. Mitchell\nwas scornful: Maybe James would like to vote and smoke a pipe?\n\nAnd Paul Brennan was very clear. There was a way out of this, yes. Jimmy\ncould have whatever he liked. There was just this one step that must be\ntaken first; the machine must be put back together again.\n\nWhen it came time for Jimmy to start school he was absolutely delighted;\nnothing, nothing could be worse than this.\n\nAt first it was a novel experience.\n\nHe sat at a desk along with forty-seven other children of his size,\nneatly stacked in six aisles with eight desks to the tier. He did his\nbest to copy their manners and to reproduce their halting speech and\nimperfect grammar. For the first couple of weeks he was not noticed.\n\nThe teacher, with forty-eight young new minds to study, gave him his\n2.08% of her total time and attention. Jimmy Holden was not a deportment\nproblem; his answers to the few questions she directed at him were\ncorrect. Therefore he needed less attention and got less; she spent her\ntime on the loud, the unruly and those who lagged behind in education.\n\nBecause his total acquaintance with children of his own age had been\namong the slum kids that hung around Jake Caslow's Place, Jimmy found his\nnew companions an interesting bunch.\n\nHe watched them, and he listened to them. He copied them and in two weeks\nJimmy found them pitifully lacking and hopelessly misinformed. They could\nnot remember at noon what they had been told at ten o'clock. They had\ndifficulty in reading the simple pages of the First Reader.\n\nBut he swallowed his pride and stumbled on and on, mimicking his friends\nand remaining generally unnoticed.\n\nIf written examinations were the rule in the First Grade, Jimmy would\nhave been discovered on the first one. But with less than that 2% of the\nteacher's time directed at him, Jimmy's run of correct answers did not\nattract notice. His boredom and his lack of attention during daydreams\nmade him seem quite normal.\n\nHe began to keep score on his classmates on the fly-leaf of one of his\nbooks. Jimmy was a far harsher judge than the teacher. He marked them\neither wrong or right; he gave no credit for trying, or for their\nstumbling efforts to express their muddled ideas and incomplete grasp. He\nfound their games fun at first, but quickly grew bored. When he tried to\nintroduce a note of strategy they ignored him because they did not\nunderstand. They made rules as they went along and changed them as they\nsaw fit. Then, instead of complying with their own rules, they pouted-up\nand sulked when they couldn't do as they wanted.\n\nBut in the end it was Jimmy's lack of experience in acting that tripped\nhim.\n\nHaving kept score on his playmates' answers, Jimmy knew that some fairly\nhigh percentage of answers must inevitably be wrong. So he embarked upon\na program of supplying a certain proportion of errors. He discovered that\nsupplying a wrong answer that was consistent with the age of his\ncontemporaries took too much of his intellect to keep his actions\nstraight. He forgot to employ halting speech and childlike grammar. His\nerrors were delivered in faultless grammar and excellent self-expression;\nhis correct answers came out in the English of his companions;\nmispronounced, ill-composed, and badly delivered.\n\nThe contrast was enough to attract even 2.08% of a teacher.\n\nDuring the third week of school, Jimmy was day-dreaming during class.\nAbruptly his teacher snapped, \"James Holden, how much is seven times\nnine?\"\n\n\"Sixty-three,\" replied Jimmy, completely automatic.\n\n\"James,\" she said softly, \"do you know the rest of your numbers?\"\n\nJimmy looked around like a trapped animal. His teacher waited him out\nuntil Jimmy, finding no escape, said, \"Yes'm.\"\n\n\"Well,\" she said with a bright smile. \"It's nice to know that you do. Can\nyou do the multiplication table?\"\n\n\"Yes'm.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Yes'm.\"\n\n\"Let's hear you.\"\n\nJimmy looked around. \"No, Jimmy,\" said his teacher. \"I want you to say\nit. Go ahead.\" And then as Jimmy hesitated still, she addressed the\nclass. \"This is important,\" she said. \"Someday you will have to learn it,\ntoo. You will use it all through life and the earlier you learn it the\nbetter off you all will be. _Knowledge_,\" she quoted proudly, \"_is\npower_! Now, Jimmy!\"\n\nJimmy began with two-times-two and worked his way through the long table\nto the twelves. When he finished, his teacher appointed one of the\nbetter-behaved children to watch the class. \"Jimmy,\" she said, \"I'm going\nto see if we can't put you up in the next grade. You don't belong here.\nCome along.\"\n\nThey went to the principal's office. \"Mr. Whitworth,\" said Jimmy's\nteacher, \"I have a young genius in my class.\"\n\n\"A young genius, Miss Tilden?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed. He already knows the multiplication table.\"\n\n\"You do, James? Where did you learn it?\"\n\n\"My father taught me.\"\n\nPrincipal and teacher looked at each another. They said nothing but they\nwere both recalling stories and rumors about the brilliance of his\nparents. The accident and death had not escaped notice.\n\n\"What else did they teach you, James?\" asked Mr. Whitworth. \"To read and\nwrite, of course?\"\n\n\"Yes sir.\"\n\n\"History?\"\n\nJimmy squirmed inwardly. He did not know how much to admit. \"Some,\" he\nsaid noncommittally.\n\n\"When did Columbus discover America?\"\n\n\"In Fourteen Ninety-Two.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" said Mr. Whitworth with a broad smile. He looked at Miss Tilden.\n\"You're right. Young James should be advanced.\" He looked down at Jimmy\nHolden. \"James,\" he said, \"we're going to place you in the Second Grade\nfor a tryout. Unless we're wrong, you'll stay and go up with them.\"\n\nJimmy's entry into Second Grade brought a different attitude. He had\nentered school quietly just for the sake of getting away from Paul\nBrennan. Now he was beginning to form a plan. If he could go from First\nto Second in a matter of three weeks, then, by carefully disclosing his\nstore of knowledge bit-by-bit at the proper moment, he might be able to\ngo through school in a short time. Moreover, he had tasted the first\nfruits of recognition. He craved more.\n\nSomewhere was born the quaint notion that getting through school would\nautomatically make him an adult, with all attendant privileges.\n\nSo Jimmy Holden dropped all pretense. His answers were as right as he\ncould make them. He dropped the covering mimickry of childish speech\nand took personal pride in using grammar as good as that of his teacher.\n\nThis got him nothing. The Second Grade teacher was of the \"progressive\"\nschool; she firmly believed that everybody, having been created equal,\nhad to stay that way. She pointedly avoided giving Jimmy any opportunity\nto show his capability.\n\nHe bided his time with little grace.\n\nHe found his opportunity during the visit of a school superintendent.\nDuring this session Jimmy hooted when one of his fellows said that\nColumbus proved the world was round.\n\nAngrily she demanded that Jimmy tell her who did prove it, and Jimmy\nHolden replied that he didn't know whether it was Pythagoras or one of\nhis followers, but he did know that it was one of the few things that\nAristotle ever got right. This touched her on a sore spot. She admired\nAristotle and couldn't bear to hear the great man accused of error.\n\nShe started baiting Jimmy with loaded questions and stopped when\nJimmy stated that Napoleon Bonaparte was responsible for the invention\nof canned food, the adoption of the metric system, and the development\nof the semaphore telegraph. This stopped all proceedings until Jimmy\nhimself found the references in the Britannica. That little feat of\nresearch-reference impressed the visiting superintendent. Jimmy Holden\nwas jumped into Third Grade.\n\nConvinced that he was on the right trolley, Jimmy proceeded to plunge in\nwith both feet. Third Grade Teacher helped. Within a week he was being\ncalled upon to aid the laggards. He stood out like a lighthouse; he was\nthe one who could supply the right answers when the class was stumped.\nHis teacher soon began to take a delight in belaboring the class for a\nminute before turning to Jimmy for the answer. Heaven forgive him, Jimmy\nenjoyed it. He began to hold back slyly, like a comedian building up the\ntension before a punch-line.\n\nHis classmates began to call him \"old know-it-all.\" Jimmy did not realize\nthat it was their resentment speaking. He accepted it as deference to his\nsuperior knowledge. The fact that he was not a part of their playtime\nlife did not bother him one iota. He knew very well that his size alone\nwould cut him out of the rough and heavy games of his classmates; he did\nnot know that he was cut out of their games because they disliked him.\n\nAs time wore on, some of the rougher ones changed his nickname from\n\"know-it-all\" to \"teacher's pet\"; one of them used rougher language\nstill. To this Jimmy replied in terms he'd learned from Jake Caslow's\ngutters. All that saved him from a beating was his size; even the ones\nwho disliked him would not stand for the bully's beating up a smaller\nchild.\n\nBut in other ways they picked on him. Jimmy reasoned out his own\nrelationship between intelligence and violence. He had yet to learn the\npsychology of vandalism--but he was experiencing it.\n\nFinding no enjoyment out of play periods, Jimmy took to staying in. The\npermissive school encouraged it; if Jimmy Holden preferred to tinker with\na typewriter instead of playing noisy games, his teacher saw no wrong in\nit--for his Third Grade teacher was something of an intellectual herself.\n\nIn April, one week after his sixth birthday, Jimmy Holden was jumped\nagain.\n\nJimmy entered Fourth Grade to find that his fame had gone before him; he\nwas received with sullen glances and turned backs.\n\nBut he did not care. For his birthday, he received a typewriter from Paul\nBrennan. Brennan never found out that the note suggesting it from Jimmy's\nThird Grade teacher had been written after Jimmy's prompting.\n\nSo while other children played, Jimmy wrote.\n\nHe was not immediately successful. His first several stories were\nreturned; but eventually he drew a winner and a check. Armed with\nsuperior knowledge, Jimmy mailed it to a bank that was strong in\nadvertising \"mail-order\" banking. With his first check he opened a\npay-by-the-item, no-minimum-balance checking account.\n\nGradually his batting average went up, but there were enough returned\nrejections to make Paul Brennan view Jimmy's literary effort with quiet\namusement. Still, slowly and in secret, Jimmy built up his bank balance\nby twenties, fifties, an occasional hundred.\n\nFor above everything, by now Jimmy knew that he could not go on through\nschool as he'd planned.\n\nIf his entry into Fourth Grade had been against scowls and resentment\nfrom his classmates, Fifth and Sixth would be more so. Eventually the day\nwould come when he would be held back. He was already mingling with\nchildren far beyond his size. The same permissive school that graduated\ndolts so that their stupid personalities wouldn't be warped would keep\nhim back by virtue of the same idiotic reasoning.\n\nHe laid his plans well. He covered his absence from school one morning\nand thereby gained six free hours to start going about his own business\nbefore his absence could be noticed.\n\nThis was his third escape. He prayed that it would be permanent.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK TWO:\n\nTHE HERMIT\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN\n\n\nSeventy-five miles south of Chicago there is a whistle-stop called\nShipmont. (No ship has ever been anywhere near it; neither has a\nmountain.) It lives because of a small college; the college, in turn,\nowes its maintenance to an installation of great interest to the Atomic\nEnergy Commission.\n\nShipmont is served by two trains a day--which stop only when there\nis a passenger to get on or off, which isn't often. These passengers,\ngenerally speaking, are oddballs carrying attach\u00e9 cases or eager young\nmen carrying miniature slide rules.\n\nBut on this day came a woman and a little girl.\n\nTheir total visible possessions were two battered suitcases and one\nbattered trunk. The little girl was neatly dressed, in often-washed and\nmended clothing; she carried a small covered basket, and there were\nbreadcrumbs visible on the lid. She looked bewildered, shy and\nfrightened. She was.\n\nThe mother was thirty, though there were lines of worry on her forehead\nand around her eyes that made her look older. She wore little makeup and\nher clothing had been bought for wear instead of for looks. She looked\naround, leaned absently down to pat the little girl and straightened as\nthe station-master came slowly out.\n\n\"Need anything, ma'am?\" He was pleasant enough. Janet Bagley appreciated\nthat; life had not been entirely pleasant for her for some years.\n\n\"I need a taxicab, if there is one.\"\n\n\"There is. I run it after the train gets in for them as ain't met. You're\nnot goin' to the college?\" He pronounced it \"collitch.\"\n\nJanet Bagley shook her head and took a piece of paper from her bag. \"Mr.\nCharles Maxwell, Rural Route Fifty-three, Martin's Hill Road,\" she read.\nHer daughter began to whimper.\n\nThe station-master frowned. \"Hum,\" he said, \"that's the Herm--er, d'you\nknow him?\"\n\nMrs. Bagley said: \"I've never met him. What kind of a man is he?\"\n\nThat was the sort of question the station-master appreciated. His job was\nneither demanding nor exciting; an opportunity to talk was worth having.\nHe said cheerfully, \"Why, I don't rightly know, ma'am. Nobody's ever seen\nhim.\"\n\n\"Nobody?\"\n\n\"Nope. Nobody. Does everything by mail.\"\n\n\"My goodness, what's the matter with him?\"\n\n\"Don't rightly know, ma'am. Story is he was once a professor and got in\nsome kind of big explosion. Burned the hide off'n his face and scarred up\nhis hands something turrible, so he don't want to show himself. Rented\nthe house by mail, pays his rent by mail. Orders stuff by mail. Mostly\nnot real U-nited States Mail, y'know, because we don't mind dropping off\na note to someone in town. I'm the local mailman, too. So when I find a\nnote to Herby Wharton, the fellow that owns the general store, I drop it\noff. Margie Clark over at the bank says he writes. Gets checks from New\nYork from publishing companies.\" The station-master looked around as if\nhe were looking for Soviet spies. \"He's a scientist, all right. He's\ndoin' something important and hush-hush up there. Lots and lots of boxes\nand packin' cases I've delivered up there from places like Central\nScientific and Labotory Supply Company. Must be a smart feller. You\nvisitin' him?\"\n\n\"Well, he hired me for housekeeper. By mail.\" Mrs. Bagley looked puzzled\nand concerned.\n\nLittle Martha began to cry.\n\n\"It'll be all right,\" said the station-master soothingly. \"You keep your\neye open,\" he said to Mrs. Bagley. \"Iff'n you see anything out of line,\nyou come right back and me and the missus will give you a lift. But he's\nall right. Nothin' goin' on up there that I know of. Fred Riordan--he's\nthe sheriff--has watched the place for days and days and it's always\nquiet. No visitors. No nothin'. Know what I think? I think he's\nexperimenting with something to take away the burn scars. That's whut\nI think. Well, hop in and I'll drive you out there.\"\n\n\"Is it going to cost much?\"\n\n\"Nothin' this trip. We'll charge it to the U-nited States Mail. Got a\npackage goin' out. Was waitin' for something else to go along with it,\nbut you're here and we can count that. This way to the only taxicab\nservice in Shipmont.\"\n\nThe place looked deserted. It was a shabby old clapboard house; the\narchitecture of the prosperous farmer of seventy-five years ago. The\ngrounds were spacious but the space was filled with scrub weeds. A\npicket fence surrounded the weeds with uncertain security. The\nwindows--those that could be seen, that is--were dirty enough to prevent\nseeing inside with clarity, and what transparency there was left was\ncovered by curtains. The walk up the \"lawn\" was flagstone with crabgrass\nbetween the stones.\n\nThe station-master unshipped the small trunk and stood it just inside the\nfence. He parked the suitcases beside it. \"Never go any farther than\nthis,\" he explained. \"So far's I know, you're the first person to ever\nhead up thet walk to the front door.\"\n\nMrs. Bagley rapped on the door. It opened almost instantly.\n\n\"I'm--\" then Mrs. Bagley dropped her eyes to the proper level. To the lad\nwho was standing there she said, \"I'm Mrs. Bagley. Your father--a Mr.\nCharles Maxwell is expecting me.\"\n\n\"Come in,\" said Jimmy Holden. \"Mr. Maxwell--well, he isn't my father. He\nsent me to let you in.\"\n\nMrs. Bagley entered and dropped her suitcases in the front hall. Martha\nheld back behind her mother's skirt. Jimmy closed the door and locked it\ncarefully, but left the key in the keyhole with a gesture that Mrs.\nBagley could not mistake. \"Please come in here and sit down,\" said James\nHolden. \"Relax a moment.\" He turned to look at the girl. He smiled at\nher, but she cowered behind her mother's skirt as if she wanted to bury\nher face but was afraid to lose sight of what was going on around her.\n\n\"What's your name?\" asked James.\n\nShe retreated, hiding most of her face. Mrs. Bagley stroked her hair and\nsaid, \"Now, Martha, come on. Tell the little boy your name.\"\n\nPurely as a matter of personal pride, James Holden objected to the\n\"little boy\" but he kept his peace because he knew that at eight years\nold he was still a little boy. In a soothing way, James said, \"Come on\nout, Martha. I'll show you some girl-type toys we've got.\"\n\nThe girl's head emerged slowly, \"I'm Martha Bagley,\" she announced.\n\n\"How old are you?\"\n\n\"I'm seven.\"\n\n\"I'm eight,\" stated James. \"Come on.\"\n\nMrs. Bagley looked around. She saw that the dirt on the windows was all\non the outside. The inside was clean. So was the room. So were the\ncurtains. The room needed a dusting--a most thorough dusting. It had been\ngiven a haphazard lick-and-a-promise cleanup not too long ago, but the\ncleanup before that had been as desultory as the last, and without a\ndoubt the one before and the one before that had been of the same sort of\nhalf-hearted cleaning. As a woman and a housekeeper, Mrs. Bagley found\nthe room a bit strange.\n\nThe furniture caught her eye first. A standard open bookcase, a low sofa,\na very low cocktail-type table. The chair she stood beside was standard\nlooking, so was the big easy chair opposite. Yet she felt large in the\nroom despite its old-fashioned high ceiling. There were several low\nfootstools in the room; ungraceful things that were obviously wooden\nboxes covered with padding and leatherette. The straight chair beside her\nhad been lowered; the bottom rung between the legs was almost on the\nfloor.\n\nShe realized why she felt big. The furniture in the room had all been cut\ndown.\n\nShe continued to look. The strangeness continued to bother her and she\nrealized that there were no ash trays; there was none of the usual\nclutter of things that a family drops in their tracks. It was a room\nfashioned for a small person to live in but it wasn't lived-in.\n\nThe lack of hard cleanliness did not bother hervery much. There had been\nan effort here, and the fact that this Charles Maxwell was hiring a\nhousekeeper was in itself a statement that the gentleman knew that he\nneeded one. It was odd, but it wasn't ominous.\n\nShe shook her daughter gently and said, \"Come on, Martha. Let's take a\nlook at these girl-type toys.\"\n\nJames led them through a short hallway, turned left at the first door,\nand then stood aside to give them a full view of the room. It was a\nplayroom for a girl. It was cleaner than the living room, and as--well,\nuntouched. It had been furnished with girl-toys that some catalog\n\"recommended as suitable for a girl of seven.\"\n\nThe profusion of toys overwhelmed little Martha. She stood just inside of\nthe door with her eyes wide, glancing back and forth. She took one slow\nstep forward, then another. Then she quickened. She moved through the\nroom looking, then putting out a slow, hesitant hand to touch very\ngently. Tense, as if she were waiting for the warning not to touch,\nMartha finally caressed the hair of a baby doll.\n\nMrs. Bagley smiled. \"I'll have a time prying her loose from here,\" she\nsaid.\n\nJames nodded his head. \"Let her amuse herself for a bit,\" he said. \"With\nMartha occupied, you can give your attention to a more delicate matter.\"\n\nMrs. Bagley forgot that she was addressing an eight-year-old boy. His\nmanner and his speech bemused her. \"Yes,\" she said. \"I do want to get\nthis settled with your mysterious Charles Maxwell. Do you expect him\ndown, or shall I go upstairs--?\"\n\n\"This may come as a shock, Mrs. Bagley, but Charles Maxwell isn't here.\"\n\n\"Isn't here?\" she echoed, in a tone of voice that clearly indicated that\nshe had heard the words but hadn't really grasped their full meaning. \"He\nwon't be gone long, will he?\"\n\nJames watched her covertly, then said in a matter-of-fact voice, \"He left\nyou a letter.\"\n\n\"Letter?\"\n\n\"He was called away on some urgent business.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Please read the letter. It explains everything.\"\n\nHe handed her an envelope addressed to \"Mrs. Janet Bagley.\" She looked\nat it from both sides, in the womanlike process of trying to divine its\ncontents instead of opening it. She looked at James, but James sat\nstolidly waiting. Mrs. Bagley was going to get no more information from\nhim until she read that letter, and James was prepared to sit it out\nuntil she did. It placed Mrs. Bagley in the awkward position of having\nto decide what to do next. Then the muffled sound of little-girl crooning\ncame from the distant room. That brought the realization that as odd as\nthis household was, it was a _home_. Mrs. Bagley delayed no further. She\nopened the letter and read:\n\n  My Dear Mrs. Bagley:\n\n  I deeply regret that I am not there to greet you, but it was not\n  possible. However, please understand that insofar as I am concerned,\n  you were hired and have been drawing your salary from the date that I\n  forwarded railroad fare and traveling expenses. Any face-to-face\n  meeting is no more than a pleasantry, a formal introduction. It must\n  not be considered in any way connected with the thought of a \"Final\n  Interview\" or the process of \"Closing the Deal.\"\n\n  Please carry on as if you had been in charge long before I departed,\n  or--considering my hermitlike habits--the way you would have carried\n  on if I had not departed, but instead was still upstairs and hard at\n  work with most definite orders that I was not to be disturbed for\n  anything less important than total, personal disaster.\n\n  I can offer you a word of explanation about young James. You will find\n  him extraordinarily competent for a youngster of eight years. Were he\n  less competent, I might have delayed my departure long enough to pass\n  him literally from my supervision to yours. However, James is quite\n  capable of taking care of himself; this fact you will appreciate fully\n  long before you and I meet face-to-face.\n\n  In the meantime, remember that our letters and the other references\n  acquaint us with one another far better than a few short hours of\n  personal contact.\n\n  Sincerely,\n  Charles Maxwell\n\n\"Well!\" said Mrs. Bagley. \"I don't know what to say.\"\n\nJimmy smiled. \"You don't have to say anything,\" he said.\n\nMrs. Bagley looked at the youngster. \"I don't think I like your Mr.\nMaxwell,\" she said.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"He's practically shanghaied me here. He knows very well that I couldn't\npossibly leave you here all alone, no matter how I disliked the\nsituation. He's practically forced me to stay.\"\n\nJames suppressed a smile. He said, \"Mrs. Bagley, the way the trains run\nin and out of Shipmont, you're stuck for an overnight stay in any case.\"\n\n\"You don't seem to be perturbed.\"\n\n\"I'm not,\" he said.\n\nMrs. Bagley looked at James carefully. His size; his physique was\nprecisely that of the eight-year-old boy. There was nothing malformed nor\nout-of-proportion; yet he spoke with an adult air of confidence.\n\n\"I am,\" she admitted.\n\n\"Perturbed? You needn't be,\" he said. \"You've got to remember that\nwriters are an odd lot. They don't conform. They don't punch time-clocks.\nThey boast of having written a novel in three weeks but they don't\nmention the fact that they sat around drinking beer for six months\nplotting it.\"\n\n\"Meaning what?\"\n\n\"Meaning that Maxwell sees nothing wrong in attending to his own affairs\nand expecting you to attend to yours.\"\n\n\"But what shall I do?\"\n\nJames smiled. \"First, take a look around the house and satisfy yourself.\nYou'll find the third floor shut off; the rooms up there are Maxwell's,\nand no one goes in but him. My bedroom is the big one in the front of the\nsecond floor. Pick yourself a room or a suite of rooms or move in all\nover the rest of the house. Build yourself a cup of tea and relax. Do as\nhe says: Act as if you'd arrived before he took off, that you'd met and\nagreed verbally to do what you've already agreed to do by letter. Look at\nit from his point of view.\"\n\n\"What is his point of view?\"\n\n\"He's a writer. He rented this house by mail. He banks by mail and shops\nby mail and makes his living by writing. Don't be surprised when he hires\na housekeeper by mail and hands her the responsibility in writing. He\nlives by the written word.\"\n\nMrs. Bagley said, \"In other words, the fact that he offered me a job in\nwriting and I took it in writing--?\"\n\n\"Writing,\" said James Holden soberly, \"was invented for the express\npurpose of recording an agreement between two men in a permanent form\nthat could be read by other men. The whole world runs on the theory that\nno one turns a hand until names are signed to written contracts--and here\nyou sit, not happy because you weren't contracted-for by a personal\nchit-chat and a handshake.\"\n\nMrs. Bagley was taken aback slightly by this rather pointed criticism.\nWhat hurt was the fact that, generally speaking, it was true and\nespecially the way he put it. The young man was too blunt, too\nout-spokenly direct. Obviously he needed someone around the place who\nwasn't the self-centered writer-type. And, Mrs. Bagley admitted to\nherself, there certainly was no evidence of evil-doing here.\n\nNo matter what, Charles Maxwell had neatly trapped her into staying by\nturning her own maternal responsibility against her.\n\n\"I'll get my bags,\" she said.\n\nJames Holden took a deep breath. He'd won this hurdle, so far so good.\nNow for the next!\n\nMrs. Bagley found life rather unhurried in the days that followed. She\nrelaxed and tried to evaluate James Holden. To her unwarned mind, the boy\nwas quite a puzzle.\n\nThere was no doubt about his eight years, except that he did not whoop\nand holler with the aimlessness of the standard eight-year-old boy. His\nvocabulary was far ahead of the eight-year-old and his speech was in\nadult grammar rather than halting. It was, she supposed, due to his\nconstant adult company; children denied their contemporaries for\nplaymates often take on attitudes beyond their years. Still, it was a bit\non the too-superior side to please her. It was as if he were the result\nof over-indulgent parents who'd committed the mistake of letting the\nchild know that their whole universe revolved about him.\n\nYet Maxwell's letters said that he was motherless, that he was not\nMaxwell's son. This indicated a probable history of broken homes and\nremarriages. Mrs. Bagley thought the problem over and gave it up. It\nwas a home.\n\nThings went on. They started warily but smoothly at first with Mrs.\nBagley asking almost incessantly whether Mr. Maxwell would approve of\nthis or that and should she do this or the other and, phrased cleverly,\nindicated that she would take the word of young James for the time being\nbut there would be evil sputterings in the fireplace if the programs\napproved by young James Holden were not wholly endorsed by Mr. Charles\nMaxwell.\n\nAt the end of the first week, supplies were beginning to run short and\nstill there was no sign of any return of the missing Mr. Maxwell. With\nsome misgiving, Mrs. Bagley broached the subject of shopping to James.\nThe youngster favored Mrs. Bagley with another smile.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said calmly. \"Just a minute.\" And he disappeared upstairs to\nfetch another envelope. Inside was a second letter which read:\n\n  My Dear Mrs. Bagley:\n\n  Attached you will find letters addressed to several of the local\n  merchants in Shipmont, explaining your status as my housekeeper and\n  directing them to honor your purchases against my accounts. Believe me,\n  they recognize my signature despite the fact that they might not\n  recognize me! There should be no difficulty. I'd suggest, however, that\n  you start a savings account at the local bank with the enclosed salary\n  check. You have no idea how much weight the local banker carries in his\n  character-reference of folks with a savings account.\n\n  Otherwise, I trust things are pleasant.\n\n  Sincerely,\n  Charles Maxwell.\n\n\"Things,\" she mused aloud, \"are pleasant enough.\"\n\nJames nodded. \"Good,\" he said. \"You're satisfied, then?\"\n\nMrs. Bagley smiled at him wistfully. \"As they go,\" she said, \"I'm\nsatisfied. Lord knows, you're no great bother, James, and I'll be most\nhappy to tell Mr. Maxwell so when he returns.\"\n\nJames nodded. \"You're not concerned over Maxwell, are you?\"\n\nShe sobered. \"Yes,\" she said in a whisper. \"Yes, I am. I'm afraid that\nhe'll change things, that he'll not approve of Martha, or the way dinner\nis made, or my habits in dishwashing or bedmaking or marketing or\nsomething that will--well, put me right in the role of a paid\nchambermaid, a servant, a menial with no more to say about the running\nof the house, once he returns.\"\n\nJames Holden hesitated, thought, then smiled.\n\n\"Mrs. Bagley,\" he said apologetically, \"I've thrown you a lot of curves.\nI hope you won't mind one more.\"\n\nThe woman frowned. James said hurriedly, \"Oh, it's nothing bad, believe\nme. I mean--Well, you'll have to judge for yourself.\n\n\"You see, Mrs. Bagley,\" he said earnestly, \"there isn't any Charles\nMaxwell.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJanet Bagley, with the look of a stricken animal, sat down heavily. There\nwere two thoughts suddenly in her mind: _Now I've got to leave_, and,\n_But I can't leave_.\n\nShe sat looking at the boy, trying to make sense of what he had said.\nMrs. Bagley was a young woman, but she had lived a demanding and\nunrelenting life; her husband dead, her finances calamitous, a baby to\nfeed and raise ... there had been enough trouble in her life and she\nsought no more.\n\nBut she was also a woman of some strength of character.\n\nJanet Bagley had not been able to afford much joy, but when things were\nat their worst she had not wept. She had been calm. She had taken what\ninexpensive pleasures she could secure--the health of her daughter, the\nstrength of her arms to earn a living, the cunning of her mind to make a\ndollar do the work of five. She had learned that there was no bargain\nthat was not worth investigating; the shoddiest goods were worth owning\nat a price; the least attractive prospect had to be faced and understood,\nfor any commodity becomes a bargain when the price is right. There was\nno room for laziness or indulgence in her life. There was also no room\nfor panic.\n\nSo Janet Bagley thought for a moment, and then said: \"Tell me what you're\ntalking about, James.\"\n\nJames Holden said immediately: \"I am Charles Maxwell. That is, 'Charles\nMaxwell' is a pen name. He has no other existence.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"But it's true, Mrs. Bagley,\" the boy said earnestly. \"I'm only eight\nyears old, but I happen to be earning my own living--as a writer, under\nthe name of, among others, Charles Maxwell. Perhaps you've looked up some\nof the 'Charles Maxwell' books? If so, you may have seen some of the book\nreviews that were quoted on the jackets--I remember one that said that\nCharles Maxwell writes as though he himself were a boy, with the\neducation of an adult. Well, that's the fact of the case.\"\n\nMrs. Bagley said slowly, \"But I did look Mr. Max--I mean, I did look you\nup. There was a complete biographical sketch in _Woman's Life_.\nThirty-one years old, I remember.\"\n\n\"I know. I wrote it. It too was fiction.\"\n\n\"You wrote--but why?\"\n\n\"Because I was asked to write it,\" said James.\n\n\"But, well--what I mean, is--Just who is Mr. Maxwell? The man at the\nstation said something about a hermit, but--\"\n\n\"The Hermit of Martin's Hill is a convenient character carefully prepared\nto explain what might have looked like a very odd household,\" said James\nHolden. \"Charles Maxwell, the Hermit, does not exist except in the minds\nof the neighbors and the editors of several magazines, and of course, the\nreaders of those pages.\"\n\n\"But he wrote me himself.\" The bewildered woman paused.\n\n\"That's right, Mrs. Bagley. There's absolutely nothing illegal about a\nwriter's using a pen name. Absolutely nothing. Some writers become so\nwell-known by their pseudonym that they answer when someone calls them.\nSo long as the writer isn't wanted by the F.B.I. for some heinous crime,\nand so long as he can unscramble the gobbledygook on Form 1040, stay out\nof trouble, pay his rent, and make his regular contributions to Social\nSecurity, nobody cares what name he uses.\"\n\n\"But where are your parents? Have you no friends? No legal guardian? Who\nhandles your business affairs?\"\n\nJames said in a flat tone of recital, \"My parents are dead. What friends\nand family I have, want to turn me over to my legal guardian. My legal\nguardian is the murderer of my parents and the would-have-been murderer\nof me if I hadn't been lucky. Someday I shall prove it. And I handle my\naffairs myself, by mail, as you well know. I placed the advertisement,\nwrote the letters of reply, wrote those letters that answered specific\nquestions and asked others, and I wrote the check that you cashed in\norder to buy your railroad ticket, Mrs. Bagley. No, don't worry. It's\ngood.\"\n\nMrs. Bagley tried to digest all that and failed. She returned to the\ncentral point. \"But you're a minor--\"\n\n\"I am,\" admitted James Holden. \"But you accepted my checks, your bank\naccepted my checks, and they've been honored by the clearing houses. My\nown bank has been accepting them for a couple of years now. It will\ncontinue to be that way until something goes wrong and I'm found out. I'm\ntaking every precaution that nothing goes wrong.\"\n\n\"Still--\"\n\n\"Mrs. Bagley, look at me. I am precisely what I seem to be. I am a young\nmale human being, eight years old, possessed of a good command of the\nEnglish language and an education superior to the schooling of any\nhigh-school graduate. It is true that I am an infant in the eyes of the\nlaw, so I have not the right to hold the ear of the law long enough to\nexplain my competence.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Listen a moment,\" insisted James. \"You can't hope to hear it all in one\nshort afternoon. It may take weeks before you fully understand.\"\n\n\"You assume that I'll stay, then?\"\n\nJames smiled. Not the wide open, simple smile of youth but the knowing\nsmile of someone pleased with the success of his own plans. \"Mrs. Bagley,\nof the many replies to my advertisement, yours was selected because you\nare in a near-desperate position. My advertisement must have sounded\ntailor-made to fit your case; a young widow to work as resident\nhousekeeper, child of preschool or early school age welcome. Well, Mrs.\nBagley, your qualifications are tailor-made for me, too. You are in need,\nand I can give you what you need--a living salary, a home for you and\nyour daughter, and for your daughter an education that will far transcend\nany that you could ever provide for her.\"\n\n\"And how do you intend to make that come to pass?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Bagley, at the present time there are only two people alive who\nknow the answer to that question. I am one of them. The other is my\nso-called legal 'guardian' who would be most happy to guard me right out\nof my real secret. You will be the third person alive to know that my\nmother and father built a machine that produces the same deeply-inlaid\nmemory-track of information as many months of learning-by-repetition.\nWith that machine, I absorbed the information available to a high-school\nstudent before I was five. I am rebuilding that machine now from plans\nand specifications drilled into my brain by my father. When it is\ncomplete, I intend to become the best informed person in the world.\"\n\n\"That isn't right,\" breathed Mrs. Bagley.\n\n\"Isn't it?\" asked James seriously. \"Isn't it right? Is it wrong, when at\nthe present time it takes a man until he is almost thirty years old\nbefore he can say that his education is complete?\"\n\n\"Well, I suppose you're right.\"\n\nJames eyed Mrs. Bagley carefully. He said softly, \"Mrs. Bagley, tell me,\nwould you give Martha a college education if you had--or will you if you\nhave at the time--the wherewithal to provide it?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"You have it here,\" said James. \"So long as you stay to protect it.\"\n\n\"But won't it make--?\" her voice trailed away uncertainly.\n\n\"A little intellectual monster out of her?\" laughed the boy. \"Maybe.\nMaybe I am, too. On the other hand it might make a brilliant woman out of\nher. She might be a doctor if she has the capacity of a brilliant doctor.\nMy father's machine is no monster-maker, Mrs. Bagley. With it a person\ncould memorize the Britannica. And from the Britannica that person would\nlearn that there is much good in the world and also that there is rich\nreward for being a part of that capacity for good.\"\n\n\"I seem to have been outmaneuvered,\" said Mrs. Bagley with a worried\nfrown.\n\nJames smiled. \"Not at all,\" he said. \"It was just a matter of finding\nsomeone who wanted desperately to have what I wanted to give, and of\ncourse overcoming the natural adult reluctance to admit that anybody\nmy size and age can operate on grown-up terms.\"\n\n\"You sound so sure of yourself.\"\n\n\"I am sure of myself. And one of the more important things in life is to\nunderstand one's limitations.\"\n\n\"But couldn't you convince them--?\"\n\n\"One--you--I can convince. Maybe another, later. But if I tackle the\ngreat American public, I'm licked by statistics. My guess is that there\nis one brand-new United States citizen born every ten seconds. It takes\nme longer than ten seconds to convince someone, that I know what I'm\ntalking about. But so long as I have an accepted adult out front, running\nthe store, I don't have to do anything but sit backstage, run the hidden\nstrings, and wait until my period of growth provides me with a stature\nthat won't demand any explanation.\"\n\nFrom the playroom, Martha came running. \"Mummy! Mummy!\" she cried in a\nshrill voice filled with the strident tones of alarm, \"Dolly's sick and\nI can't leave her!\"\n\nMrs. Bagley folded her daughter in her arms. \"We won't leave,\" she said.\n\"We're staying.\"\n\nJames Holden nodded with satisfaction, but one thing he realized then and\nthere: He simply had to rush the completion of his father's machine.\n\nHe could not stand the simpering prattle of Martha Bagley's playgames.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER EIGHT\n\n\nThe arrival of Mrs. Bagley changed James Holden's way of life far more\nthan he'd expected. His basic idea had been to free himself from the\nhours of dishwashing, bedmaking, dusting, cleaning and straightening\nand from the irking chore of planning his meals far enough ahead to\nobtain sustenance either through mail or carried note. He gave up his\nhaphazard chores readily. Mrs. Bagley's menus often served him dishes\nthat he wouldn't have given house-room; but he also enjoyed many meals\nthat he could not or would not have taken the time to prepare.\n\nHe did have some faint notion that being freed from the household toil\nwould allow him sixteen or eighteen hours at the typewriter, but he was\nnot greatly dismayed to find that this did not work.\n\nWhen he wrote himself out, he relaxed by reading, or sitting quietly\nplanning his next piece. Even that did not fill his entire day. To take\nsome advantage of his time, James began to indulge in talk-fests with\nMrs. Bagley.\n\nThese were informative. He was learning from her how the outside world\nwas run, from one who had no close association with his own former life.\nMrs. Bagley was by no means well-informed on all sides of life, but she\ndid have her opinions and her experiences and a fair idea of how things\nwent on in her own level. And, of course, James had made this choice\nbecause of the girl. He wanted a companion of his own age. Regardless of\nwhat Mrs. Bagley really thought of this matter of rapid education, James\nproposed to use it on Martha. That would give him a companion of his own\nlike, they would come closer to understanding one another than he could\never hope to find understanding elsewhere.\n\nSo he talked and played with Martha in his moments of relaxation. And he\nfound her grasp of life completely unreal.\n\nJames could not get through to her. He could not make her stop\nplay-acting in everything that she did not ignore completely. It worried\nhim.\n\nWith the arrival of summer, James and Martha played outside in the fresh\nair. They made a few shopping excursions into town, walking the mile and\nmore by taking their time, and returning with their shopping load in the\nstation-master's taxicab mail car. But on these expeditions, James hung\nclose to Martha lest her babbling prattle start an unwelcome line of\nthought. She never did it, but James was forever on edge.\n\nThis source of possible danger drove him hard. The machine that was\ngrowing in a mare's-nest on the second floor began to evolve faster.\n\nJames Holden's work was a strangely crude efficiency. The prototype had\nbeen built by his father bit by bit and step by step as its design\ndemanded. Sections were added as needed, and other sections believed\nneeded were abandoned as the research showed them unnecessary. Louis\nHolden had been a fine instrumentation engineer, but his first models\nwere hay-wired in the breadboard form. James copied his father's\nwork--including his father's casual breadboard style. And he added some\ninefficiencies of his own.\n\nFurthermore, James was not strong enough to lift the heavier assemblies\ninto place. James parked the parts wherever they would sit.\n\nTo Mrs. Bagley, the whole thing was bizarre and unreasonable. Given her\nopinion, with no other evidence, she would have rejected the idea at\nonce. She simply did not understand anything of a technical nature.\n\nOne day she bluntly asked him how he knew what he was doing.\n\nJames grinned. \"I really _don't_ know what I'm doing,\" he admitted. \"I'm\nonly following some very explicit directions. If I knew the pure theory\nof my father's machine I could not design the instrumentation that would\nmake it work. But I can build a reproduction of my father's machine from\nthe directions.\"\n\n\"How can that be?\"\n\nJames stopped working and sat on a packing case. \"If you bought a\nlawn-mower,\" he said, \"it might come neatly packed in a little box with\nall the parts nested in cardboard formers and all the little nuts and\nbolts packed in a bag. There would be a set of assembly directions,\nwritten in such a way as to explain to anybody who can read that Part A\nis fastened to Bracket B using Bolt C, Lockwasher D, and Nut E. My\nfather's one and only recognition of the dangers of the unforeseeable\nfuture was to drill deep in my brain these directions. For instance,\" and\nhe pointed to a boxed device, \"that thing is an infra-low frequency\namplifier. Now, I haven't much more than a faint glimmer of what the\nthing is and how it differs from a standard amplifier, but I know that it\nmust be built precisely thus-and-so, and finally it must be fitted into\nthe machine per instructions. Look, Mrs. Bagley.\" James picked up a\nrecently-received package, swept a place clear on the packing case and\ndumped it out. It disgorged several paper bags of parts, some large\nplates and a box. He handed her a booklet. \"Try it yourself,\" he said.\n\"That's a piece of test equipment made in kit form by a commercial outfit\nin Michigan. Follow those directions and build it for me.\"\n\n\"But I don't know anything about this sort of thing.\"\n\n\"You can read,\" said James with a complete lack of respect. He turned\nback to his own work, leaving Mrs. Bagley leafing her way through the\nassembly manual.\n\nTo the woman it was meaningless. But as she read, a secondary thought\nrose in her mind. James was building this devilish-looking nightmare, and\nhe had every intention of using it on her daughter! She accepted without\nunderstanding the fact that James Holden's superior education had come of\nsuch a machine--but it had been a machine built by a competent mechanic.\nShe stole a look at James. The anomaly puzzled her.\n\nWhen the lad talked, his size and even the thin boyish voice were negated\nby the intelligence of his words, the size of his vocabulary, the clarity\nof his statements. Now that he was silent, he became no more than an\neight-year-old lad who could not possibly be doing anything constructive\nwith this mad array of equipment. The messiness of the place merely made\nthe madness of the whole program seem worse.\n\nBut she turned back to her booklet. Maybe James was right. If she could\nassemble this doodad without knowing the first principle of its\noperation, without even knowing from the name what the thing did, then\nshe might be willing to admit that--messy as it looked--the machine could\nbe reconstructed.\n\nTrapped by her own interest, Mrs. Bagley pitched in.\n\nThey took a week off to rearrange the place. They built wooden shelves to\nhold the parts in better order. These were by no means the work of a\ncarpenter, for Mrs. Bagley's aim with a saw was haphazard, and her\nbatting average with a hammer was about .470; but James lacked the\nstrength, so the construction job was hers. Crude as it was, the place\nlooked less like a junkshop when they were done. Work resumed on the\nassembly of the educator.\n\nOf course the writing suffered.\n\nThe budget ran low. James was forced to abandon the project for his\ntypewriter. He drove himself hard, fretting and worrying himself into a\nstew time after time. And then as August approached, Nature stepped in to\nadd more disorder.\n\nJames entered a \"period of growth.\" In three weeks he gained two inches.\n\nHis muscles, his bones and his nervous system ceased to coordinate. He\nbecame clumsy. His handwriting underwent a change, so severe that James\nhad to practically forge his own signature of Charles Maxwell. To avoid\ntrouble he stopped the practice of writing individual checks for the\nbills and transferred a block sum of money to an operating account in\nMrs. Bagley's name.\n\nHis fine regimen went to pieces.\n\nHe embarked on a haphazard program of sleeping, eating and working at odd\nhours, and his appetite became positively voracious. He wanted what he\nwanted when he wanted it, even if it were the middle of the night. He\npouted and groused when he didn't get it. In calmer moments he hated\nhimself for these tantrums, but no amount of self-rationalization stopped\nthem.\n\nDuring this period, James was by no means an efficient youngster. His\nwriting suffered the ills of both his period of growth and his upset\nstate of mind. His fingers failed to coordinate on his typewriter and his\nmanuscript copy turned out rough, with strikeovers, xxx-outs, and gross\nmistakes. The pile of discarded paper massed higher than his finished\ncopy until Mrs. Bagley took over and began to retype his rough script\nfor him.\n\nHis state of mind remained chaotic.\n\nMrs. Bagley began to treat him with special care. She served him warm\nmilk and insisted that he rest. Finally she asked him why he drove\nhimself so hard.\n\n\"We are approaching the end of summer,\" he said, \"and we are not\nprepared.\"\n\n\"Prepared for what?\"\n\nThey were relaxing in the living room, James fretting and Mrs. Bagley\nseated, Martha Bagley asprawl on the floor turning the pages of a\ncrayon-coloring book. \"Look at us,\" he said. \"I am a boy of eight, your\ndaughter is a girl of seven. By careful dress and action I could pass for\na child one year younger, but that would still make me seven. Last summer\nwhen I was seven, I passed for six.\"\n\n\"Yes, but--?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Bagley, there are laws about compulsory education. Sooner or later\nsomeone is going to get very curious about us.\"\n\n\"What do you intend to do about it?\"\n\n\"That's the problem,\" he said. \"I don't really know. With a lot of\nconcentrated effort I can probably enter school if I have to, and keep my\neducation covered up. But Martha is another story.\"\n\n\"I don't see--?\" Mrs. Bagley bit her lip.\n\n\"We can't permit her to attend school,\" said James.\n\n\"You shouldn't have advertised for a woman with a girl child!\" said Mrs.\nBagley.\n\n\"Perhaps not. But I wanted someone of my own age and size around so that\nwe can grow together. I'm a bit of a misfit until I'm granted the right\nto use my education as I see fit.\"\n\n\"And you hope to make Martha another misfit?\"\n\n\"If you care to put it that way,\" admitted James. \"Someone has to start.\nSomeday all kids will be educated with my machine and then there'll be no\nmisfits.\"\n\n\"But until then--?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Bagley, I am not worried about what is going to happen next year. I\nam worried about what is going to happen next month.\"\n\nMrs. Bagley sat and watched him for a moment. This boy was worried, she\ncould see that. But assuming that any part of his story was true--and it\nwas impossible to doubt it--he had ample cause.\n\nThe past years had given Mrs. Bagley a hard shell because it was useful\nfor survival; to keep herself and her child alive she had had to be\npermanently alert for every threat. Clearly this was a threat. Martha was\ninvolved. Martha's future was, at the least, bound to be affected by what\nJames did.\n\nAnd the ties of blood and habit made Martha's future the first\nconsideration in Janet Bagley's thoughts.\n\nBut not the only consideration; for there is an in-born trait in the\nhuman race which demands that any helpless child should be helped. James\nwas hardly helpless; but he certainly was a child. It was easy to forget\nit, talking to him--until something came up that the child could not\nhandle.\n\nMrs. Bagley sighed. In a different tone she asked, \"What did you do last\nyear?\"\n\n\"Played with Rags on the lawn,\" James said promptly. \"A boy and his dog\nis a perfectly normal sight--in the summer. Then, when school opened, I\nstayed in the house as much as I could. When I had to go out I tried to\nmake myself look younger. Short pants, dirty face. I don't think I could\nget away with it this year.\"\n\n\"I think you're right,\" Mrs. Bagley admitted. \"Well, suppose you could do\nwhat you wish this year? What would that be?\"\n\nJames said: \"I want to get my machine working. Then I want to use it on\nMartha.\"\n\n\"On Martha! But--\"\n\nJames said patiently: \"It won't hurt her, Mrs. Bagley. There isn't any\nother way. The first thing she needs is a good command of English.\"\n\n\"English?\" Mrs. Bagley hesitated, and was lost. After all, what was wrong\nwith the girl's learning proper speech?\n\n\"Martha is a child both physically and intellectually. She has been\ntalked to about 'right' and 'wrong' and she knows that 'telling the\ntruth' is right, but she doesn't recognize that talking about fairies is\na misstatement of the truth. Question her carefully about how we live,\nand you'll get a fair approximation of the truth.\"\n\n\"So?\"\n\n\"But suppose someone asks Martha about the Hermit of Martin's Hill?\"\n\n\"What do you fear?\"\n\n\"We might play upon her make-believe stronger than we have. She play-acts\nhis existence very well. But suppose someone asks her what he eats, or\nwhere he gets his exercise, or some other personal question. She hasn't\nthe command of logic to improvise a convincing background.\"\n\n\"But why should anybody ask such personal questions?\" asked Mrs. Bagley.\n\nJames said patiently: \"To ask personal questions of an adult is 'prying'\nand is therefore considered improper and antisocial. To ask the same\nquestions of a child is proper and social. It indicates a polite interest\nin the world of the child. You and I, Mrs. Bagley, have a complete\npicture of the Hermit all prepared, and with our education we can\nimprovise plausible answers. I've hoped to finish my machine early enough\nto provide Martha with the ability to do the same.\"\n\n\"So what can we do?\"\n\n\"About the only thing we can do is to hide,\" said James. \"Luckily,\nmost of the business is conducted out of this place by mail. Write\nletters to some boarding school situated a good many miles from here.\nAsk the usual routine questions about entering a seven-year-old girl\nand an eight-year-old boy for one semester. Robert Holmes, our\npostmaster-taxicab driver-station-master, reads everything that isn't\nsealed. He will read the addresses, and he will see replies and read\ntheir return address.\"\n\n\"And then we'll pretend to send you and Martha to boarding school?\"\n\nJames nodded. \"Confinement is going to be difficult, but in this climate\nthe weather gets nasty early and that keeps people out of one another's\nhair.\"\n\n\"But this station-master business--?\"\n\n\"We've got to pull some wool over Robert's eyes,\" said James. \"Somehow,\nwe've got to make it entirely plausible. You've got to take Martha and me\naway and come back alone just as if we were in school.\"\n\n\"We should have a car,\" said Mrs. Bagley.\n\n\"A car is one piece of hardware that I could never justify,\" said James.\n\"Nor,\" he chuckled, \"buy from a mail-order house because I couldn't\naccept delivery. I bought furniture from Sears and had it delivered\naccording to mailed instructions. But I figured it better to have the\nfolks in Shipmont wondering why Charles Maxwell didn't own a car than to\nhave them puzzling why he owned one that never was used, nor even moved.\nBesides, a car--costs--\"\n\nMrs. Bagley smiled with real satisfaction. \"There,\" she said, \"I think I\ncan help. I can buy the car.\"\n\nJames was startled. \"But can you afford it?\"\n\nMrs. Bagley nodded seriously. \"James,\" she said, \"I've been scratching\nout an existence on hard terms and I've had to make sure of tomorrow.\nEven when things were worst, I tried to put something away--some weeks it\nwas only a few pennies, sometimes nothing at all. But--well, I'm not\nafraid of tomorrow any more.\"\n\nJames was oddly pleased. While he was trying to find a way to say it,\nMrs. Bagley relieved him of the necessity. \"It won't be a brand-new\nconvertible,\" she warned. \"But they tell me you can get something that\nruns for two or three hundred dollars. Tim Fisher has some that look\nabout right in his garage--and besides,\" she said, clinching it, \"it\ngives me a chance to give out a little more Maxwell and boarding-school\npropaganda.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER NINE\n\n\nThe letter was a masterpiece of dissembling. It suggested, without\npromising, that Charles Maxwell intended to send his young charge to\nboarding school along with his housekeeper's daughter. It asked the\nschool's advice and explained the deformity that made Charles Maxwell a\nrecluse. The reply could hardly have been better if they'd penned it\nthemselves for the signature of the faculty advisor. It discussed the\npros and cons of away-from-home schooling and went on at great length to\ndiscuss the attitude of children and their upbringing amid strange\nsurroundings. It invited a long and inconclusive correspondence--just\nwhat James wanted.\n\nThe supposed departure for school went off neatly, no one in the town of\nShipmont was surprised when Mrs. Bagley turned up buying an automobile of\nseveral years' vintage because this was a community where everybody had\none.\n\nThe letters continued at the rate of one every two or three weeks. They\nwere picked up by Mrs. Bagley who let it be known that these were\nprogress reports. In reality, they were little tracts on the theory of\nchild education. They kept up the correspondence for the information it\ncontained, and also because Mrs. Bagley enjoyed this contact with an\nouter world that contained adults.\n\nMeanwhile, James ended his spurt of growth and settled down. Work on his\nmachine continued when he could afford to buy the parts, and his writing\nsettled down into a comfortable channel once more. In his spare time\nJames began to work on Martha's diction.\n\nMartha could not have been called a retarded child. Her trouble was lack\nof constant parental attention during her early years. With father gone\nand mother struggling to live, Martha had never overcome some of the\nbabytalk-diction faults. There was still a trace of the omitted 'B' here\nand there. 'Y' was a difficult sound; the color of a lemon was \"Lellow.\"\nMartha's English construction still bore marks of the baby. \"Do you have\nto--\" came out as \"Does you has to--?\"\n\nJames Holden's father had struggled in just this way through his early\nexperimental days, when he despaired of ever getting the infant James out\nof the baby-prattle stage. He could not force, he could not even coerce.\nAll that his father could do was to watch quietly as baby James acquired\nthe awareness of things. Then he could step in and supply the correct\nword-sound to name the object. In those early days the progress of James\nHolden was no greater than the progress of any other infant. Holden\nSenior followed the theory of ciphers; no cryptologist can start\nunravelling a secret message until he is aware of the fact that some\nhidden message exists. No infant can be taught a language until some\nawareness tells the tiny brain that there is some definite connection\nbetween sound and sight.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor the next few weeks James worked with Martha on her speech, and hated\nit. So slow, so dreary! But it was necessary, he thought, to keep her\nfrom establishing any more permanent errors, so that when the machine was\nready there would be at least a blank slate to write on, not one all\nscribbled over with mistakes.\n\nTime passed; the weather grew colder; the machine spread its scattered\nparts over his workroom.\n\nJanet Bagley knew that the machine was growing, but it had not occurred\nto her that it would be finished. She had grown accustomed to her life on\nMartin's Hill. By her standards, it was easy. She made three meals each\nday, cleaned the rooms, hung curtains, sewed clothing for Martha and\nherself, did the shopping and had time enough left over to take\nexcursions in her little car and keep her daughter out of mischief. It\nwas pleasant. It was more than pleasant, it was safe.\n\nAnd then the machine was finished.\n\nMrs. Bagley took a sandwich and a glass of milk to James and found him\nsitting on a chair, a heavy headset covering most of his skull, reading\naloud from a textbook on electronic theory.\n\nMrs. Bagley stopped at the door, unaccountably startled.\n\nJames looked up and shut off his work. \"It's finished,\" he said with\ngrave pride.\n\n\"All of it?\"\n\n\"Well,\" he said, pondering, \"the basic part. It works.\"\n\nMrs. Bagley looked at the scramble of equipment in the room as though it\nwere an enemy. It didn't look finished. It didn't even look safe. But she\ntrusted James, although she felt at that moment that she would grow old\nand die before she understood why and how any collection of apparatus\ncould be functional and still be so untidy. \"It--could teach me?\"\n\n\"If you had something you want to memorize.\"\n\n\"I'd like to memorize some of the pet recipes from my cookbook.\"\n\n\"Get it,\" directed James.\n\nShe hesitated. \"How does it work?\" she wanted to know first.\n\nHe countered with another question. \"How do we memorize anything?\"\n\nShe thought. \"Why, by repeating and repeating and rehearsing and\nrehearsing.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said James. \"So this device does the repetition for you.\nElectromechanically.\"\n\n\"But how?\"\n\nJames smiled wistfully. \"I can give you only a thumbnail sketch,\" he\nsaid, \"until I have had time to study the subjects that lead up to the\nfinal theory.\"\n\n\"Goodness,\" exclaimed Mrs. Bagley, \"all I want is a brief idea. I\nwouldn't understand the principles at all.\"\n\n\"Well, then, my mother, as a cerebral surgeon, knew the anatomy of the\nhuman brain. My father, as an instrument-maker, designed and built\nencephalographs. Together, they discovered that if the great waves of the\nbrain were filtered down and the extremely minute waves that ride on top\nof them were amplified, the pattern of these superfine waves went through\nconvolutions peculiar to certain thoughts. Continued research refined\ntheir discovery.\n\n\"Now, the general theory is that the cells of the brain act sort of like\na binary digital computer, with certain banks of cells operating to store\nsufficient bits of information to furnish a complete memory. In the\nprocess of memorization, individual cells become activated and linked by\nthe constant repetition.\n\n\"Second, the brain within the skull is a prisoner, connected to the\n'outside' by the five standard sensory channels of sight, sound, touch,\ntaste, and smell. Stimulate a channel, and the result is a certain\nwave-shape of electrical impulse that enters the brain and--sort of like\nthe key to a Yale lock--fits only one combination of cells. Or if no\nprevious memory is there, it starts its own new collection of cells to\nlinking and combining. When we repeat and repeat, we are deepening the\ngroove, so to speak.\n\n\"Finally comes the Holden Machine. The helmet makes contact with the\nskull in those spots where the probes of the encephalograph are placed.\nWhen the brain is stimulated into thought, the brain waves are monitored\nand recorded, amplified, and then fed back to the same brain-spots. Not\nonce, but multifold, like the vibration of a reed or violin string. The\ncircuit that accepts signals, amplifies them, returns them to the same\nset of terminals, and causes them to be repeated several hundred times\nper millisecond without actually ringing or oscillating is the real\nresearch secret of the machine. My father's secret and now mine.\"\n\n\"And how do we use it?\"\n\n\"You want to memorize a list of ingredients,\" said James. \"So you will\nput this helmet on your head with the cookbook in your hands. You will\nturn on the machine when you have read the part you want to memorize just\nto be sure of your material. Then, with the machine running, you\ncarefully read aloud the passage from your book. The vibrating amplifier\nin the machine monitors and records each electrical impulse, then\nfurnishes it back to your brain as a successive series of repetitious\nvibrations, each identical in shape and magnitude, just as if you had\nactually read and re-read that list of stuff time and again.\"\n\n\"And then I'll know it cold?\"\n\nJames shook his head. \"Then you'll be about as confused as you've ever\nbeen. For several hours, none of it will make sense. You'll be thinking\nthings like a 'cup of salt and a pinch of water,' or maybe, 'sugar three\nof mustard and two spoonthree teas.' And then in a few hours all of this\nmish-mash will settle itself down into the proper serial arrangement; it\nwill fit the rest of your brain-memory-pattern comfortably.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I don't know. It has something to do with the same effect one gets out\nof studying. On Tuesday one can read a page of textbook and not grasp a\nword of it. Successive readings help only a little. Then in about a week\nit all becomes quite clear, just as if the brain had sorted it and filed\nit logically among the other bits of information. Well, what about that\ncookbook?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Bagley, with the air of someone agreeing to have a tooth\npulled when it hasn't really started to hurt, \"I'll get it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJames Holden allowed himself a few pleasant daydreams. The most\nsatisfactory of all was one of himself pleading his own case before the\nblack-robed Justices of the Supreme Court, demolishing his detractors\nwith a flow of his brilliance and convincing them beyond any doubt that\nhe did indeed have the right to walk alone. That there be no question of\nhis intellect, James proposed to use his machine to educate himself to\ncompletion. He would be the supreme student of the arts and the sciences,\nof law, language, and literature. He would know history and the\nhumanities, and the dreams and aims of the great philosophers and\nstatesmen, and he would even be able to quote in their own terms the\ndrives of the great dictators and some of the evil men so that he could\ndraw and compare to show that he knew the difference between good and\nbad.\n\nBut James Holden had no intention of sharing this limelight.\n\nHis superb brilliance was to be compared to the average man's, not to\nanother one like him. He had the head start. He intended to keep it until\nhe had succeeded in compelling the whole world to accept him with the\nfull status of a free adult.\n\nThen, under his guidance, he would permit the world-wide use of his\nmachine.\n\nHis loneliness had forced him to revise that dream by the addition of\nMartha Bagley; he needed a companion, contemporary, and foil. His mental\nplaylet no longer closed with James Holden standing alone before the\nBench. Now it ended with Martha saying proudly, \"James, I knew you could\ndo it.\"\n\nMartha Bagley's brilliance would not conflict with his. He could\nstay ahead of her forever. But he had no intention of allowing some\nexperienced adult to partake of this program of enforced education. He\nwas, therefore, going to find himself some manner or means of preventing\nMrs. Bagley from running the gamut of all available information.\n\nJames Holden evaluated all people in his own terms, he believed that\neverybody was just as eager for knowledge as he was.\n\nSo he was surprised to find that Mrs. Bagley's desire for extended\neducation only included such information as would make her own immediate\npersonal problems easier. Mrs. Bagley was the first one of the mass of\npeople James was destined to meet who not only did not know how or why\nthings worked, but further had no intention whatsoever of finding out.\n\nInstead of trying to monopolize James Holden's machine, Mrs. Bagley was\nsatisfied to learn a number of her pet recipes. After a day of thought\nshe added her social security number, blood type, some birthdays, dates,\na few telephone numbers and her multiplication tables. She announced that\nshe was satisfied. It solved James Holden's problem--and stunned him\ncompletely.\n\nBut James had very little time to worry about Mrs. Bagley's attitude. He\nfound his hands full with Martha.\n\nMartha played fey. Her actions and attitude baffled James, and even\nconfused her mother. There was no way of really determining whether the\ngirl was scared to death of the machine itself, or whether she simply\ndecided to be difficult. And she uttered the proper replies with all of\nthe promptness--and intelligence--of a ventriloquist's dummy:\n\n\"You don't want to be ignorant, do you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You want to be smart, like James, don't you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You know the machine won't hurt, don't you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then let's try it just once, please?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nBack to the beginning again. Martha would agree to absolutely anything\nexcept the educator.\n\nLeaving the argument to Mrs. Bagley, James sat down angrily with a book.\nHe was so completely frustrated that he couldn't read, but he sat there\nleafing the pages slowly and making a determined show of not lifting his\nhead.\n\nMrs. Bagley went on for another hour before she reached the end of her\nown patience. She stood up almost rigid with anger. James never knew how\nclose Mrs. Bagley was to making use of a hairbrush on her daughter's\nbottom. But Mrs. Bagley also realized that Martha had to go into this\nprocess willing to cooperate. So, instead of physical punishment, she\nissued a dictum:\n\n\"You'll go to your room and stay there until you're willing!\"\n\nAnd at that point Martha ceased being stubborn and began playing games.\n\nShe permitted herself to be led to the chair, and then went through a\nroutine of skittishness, turning her head and squirming incessantly,\nwhich made it impossible for James to place the headset properly. This\nwent on until he stalked away and sat down again. Immediately Martha sat\nlike a statue. But as soon as James reached for the little screws that\nadjusted the electrodes, Martha started to giggle and squirm. He stalked\naway and sat through another session between Martha and her mother.\n\nLate in the afternoon James succeeded in getting her to the machine;\nMartha uttered a sentence without punctuating it with little giggles, but\nit came as elided babytalk.\n\n\"Again,\" he commanded.\n\n\"I don't wan' to.\"\n\n\"Again!\" he snapped.\n\nMartha began to cry.\n\nThat, to James, was the end. But Mrs. Bagley stepped forward with a\ncommanding wave for James to vacate the premises and took over. James\ncould not analyze her expression, but it did look as if it held relief.\nHe left the room to them; a half hour later Mrs. Bagley called him back.\n\n\"She's had it,\" said Mrs. Bagley. \"Now you can start, I think.\"\n\nJames looked dubious; but said, \"Read this.\"\n\n\"Martha?\"\n\nMartha took a deep breath and said, nicely, \"'A' is the first\nletter of the English Alphabet.\"\n\n\"Good.\" He pressed the button. \"Again? Please?\"\n\nMartha recited it nicely.\n\n\"Fine,\" he said. \"Now we'll look up 'Is' and go on from there.\"\n\n\"My goodness,\" said Mrs. Bagley, \"this is going to take months.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said James. \"It just goes slowly at the start. Most of the\ndefinitions use the same words over and over again. Martha really knows\nmost of these simple words, we've just got to be dead certain that her\nown definition of them agrees wholly and completely with ours. After a\ncouple of hours of this minute detail, we'll be skipping over everything\nbut new words. After all, she only has to work them over once, and as we\nfind them, we'll mark them out of the book. Ready, Martha?\"\n\n\"Can't read it.\"\n\nJames took the little dictionary. \"Um,\" he said. \"Hadn't occurred to me.\"\n\n\"What?\" asked Mrs. Bagley.\n\n\"This thing says, Three-rd pers period sing periodic indic period of Be,'\nthe last in heavy bold type. Can't have Martha talking in abbreviations,\"\nhe chuckled. He went to the typewriter and wrote it out fully. \"Now read\nthat,\" he directed.\n\nShe did and again the process went through without a hitch. Slowly, but\nsurely, they progressed for almost two hours before Martha rebelled.\nJames stopped, satisfied with the beginning.\n\nBut as time wore on into the late autumn, Martha slowly--oh, so\nslowly!--began to realize that there was importance to getting things\nright. She continued to tease. But she did her teasing before James\nclosed the \"Run\" button.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TEN\n\n\nOnce James progressed Martha through the little dictionary, he began with\na book of grammar. Again it started slowly; he had to spend quite a bit\nof time explaining to Martha that she did indeed know all of the terms\nused in the book of grammar because they'd all been defined by the\ndictionary, now she was going to learn how the terms and their\ndefinitions were used.\n\nJames was on more familiar ground now. James, like Martha, had learned\nhis first halting sentence structure by mimicking his parents, but he\nremembered the process of learning why and how sentences are constructed\naccording to the rules, and how the rules are used rather than intuition\nin forming sentences.\n\nGrammar was a topic that could not be taken in snippets and bits. Whole\nparagraphs had to be read until Martha could read them without a halt or\na mispronunciation, and then committed to memory with the \"Run\" button\nheld down. At the best it was a boring process, even though it took only\nminutes instead of days. It was not conflicting, but it was confusing.\nIt installed permanently certain solid blocks of information that were\nisolated; they stood alone until later blocks came in to connect them\ninto a whole area.\n\nEach session was numbing. Martha could take no more than a couple of\nhours, after which her reading became foggy. She wanted a nap after each\nsession and even after the nap she went around in a bemused state of\nmental dizziness.\n\nLife settled down once more in the House on Martin's Hill. James worked\nwith the machine himself and laid out lessons to guide Martha. Then,\nfinished for the day with education, James took to his typewriter while\nMartha had her nap. It filled the days of the boy and girl completely.\n\nThis made an unexpected and pleasant change in Mrs. Bagley's routine. It\nhad been a job to keep Martha occupied. Now that Martha was busy, Mrs.\nBagley found time on her own hands; without interruption, her housework\nroutine was completed quite early in the afternoon.\n\nMrs. Bagley had never made any great point of getting dressed for dinner.\nShe accumulated a collection of house-frocks; printed cotton washables\ndiffering somewhat in color and cut but functionally identical. She wore\nthem serially as they came from the row of hangers in her closet.\n\nNow she began to acquire some dressier things, wearing them even during\nher shopping trips.\n\nJames paid little attention to this change in his housekeeper's routine,\nbut he approved. Mrs. Bagley was also taking more pains with the 'do' of\nher hair, but the boy's notice was not detailed enough to take a\npart-by-section inventory of the whole. In fact, James gave the whole\nmatter very little thought until Mrs. Bagley made a second change after\nher return from town, appearing for dinner in what James could only\nclassify as a party dress.\n\nShe asked, \"James, do you mind if I go out this evening?\"\n\nJames, startled, shrugged and said, \"No, I guess not.\"\n\n\"You'll keep an ear out for Martha?\"\n\nThe need for watching a sleeping girl of seven and a half did not\npenetrate. \"What's up?\" he asked.\n\n\"It's been months since I saw a movie.\"\n\nJames shrugged again, puzzled. \"You saw the 'Bride of Frankenstein' last\nnight on TV,\" he pointed out.\n\n\"I first saw that old horror when I was about your age,\" she told him\nwith a trace of disdain.\n\n\"I liked it.\"\n\n\"So did I at eight and a half. But tonight I'm going to see a _new_\npicture.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" said James, wondering why anybody in their right mind would go\nout on a chilly night late in November just to see a moving picture when\nthey could stay at home and watch one in comfort. \"Have a good time.\"\n\nHe expected Mrs. Bagley to take off in her car, but she did not. She\nwaited until a brief _toot_! came from the road. Then, with a swirl of\nmotion, she left.\n\nIt took James Holden's limited experience some little time to identify\nthe event with some similar scenes from books he'd read; even with him,\nreading about it was one world and seeing it happen was another thing\nentirely.\n\nFor James Holden it opened a new area for contemplation. He would have to\nknow something about this matter if he hoped to achieve his dreamed-of\nstatus as an adult.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nInformation about the relation between man and woman had not been\nincluded in the course of education devised by his father and mother.\nTherefore his physical age and his information on the delicate subject\nwere approximately parallel.\n\nHis personal evaluation of the subject was uncomplicated. At some age not\nmuch greater than his own, boys and girls conglomerated in a mass that\nmilled around in a constant state of flux and motion, like individual\natoms of gas compressed in a container. Meetings and encounters took\nplace both singly and in groups until nearly everybody had been in touch\nwith almost everybody else. Slowly the amorphous mass changed. Groups\nbecame attracted by mutual interests. Changes and exchanges took place,\nand then a pair-formation began to take place. The pair-formation went\nthrough its interchanges both with and without friction as the\nsettling-down process proceeded. At times predictable by comparing it\nto the statistics of radioactivity, the pair-production resulted in\npermanent combination, which effectively removed this couple from free\ncirculation.\n\nJames Holden had no grasp or feeling for the great catalyst that causes\nthis pair-production; he saw it only for its sheer mechanics. To him, the\nsensible way to go about this matter was to get there early and move\nfast, because one stands to make a better choice when there is a greater\nnumber of unattached specimens from which to choose. Those left over are\nlikely to have flaws.\n\nAnd so he pondered, long after Martha had gone to bed.\n\nHe was still up and waiting when he heard the car stop at the gate.\nHe watched them come up the walk arm in arm, their stride slow and\nlingering. They paused for several moments on the doorstep, once there\nwas a short, muted laugh. The snick of the key came next and they came\ninto the hallway.\n\n\"No, please don't come in,\" said Mrs. Bagley.\n\n\"But--\" replied the man.\n\n\"But me no buts. It's late, Tim.\"\n\nTim? Tim? That would probably be Timothy Fisher. He ran the local garage\nwhere Mrs. Bagley bought her car. James went on listening shamelessly.\n\n\"Late? Phooey. When is eleven-thirty late?\"\n\n\"When it's right now,\" she replied with a light laugh. \"Now, Tim. It's\nbeen very--\"\n\nThere came a long silence.\n\nHer voice was throaty when the silence broke. \"Now, will you go?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" he said.\n\n\"Not that way, silly,\" she said. \"The door's behind you.\"\n\n\"Isn't the door I want,\" he chuckled.\n\n\"We're making enough noise to wake the dead,\" she complained.\n\n\"Then let's stop talking,\" he told her.\n\nThere was another long silence.\n\n\"Now please go.\"\n\n\"Can I come back tomorrow night?\"\n\n\"Not tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Friday?\"\n\n\"Saturday.\"\n\n\"It's a date, then.\"\n\n\"All right. Now get along with you.\"\n\n\"You're cruel and heartless, Janet,\" he complained. \"Sending a man out in\nthat cold and storm.\"\n\n\"It isn't storming, and you've a fine heater in that car of yours.\"\n\n\"I'd rather have you.\"\n\n\"Do you tell that to all the girls?\"\n\n\"Sure. Even Maggie the Washerwoman is better than an old car heater.\"\n\nMrs. Bagley chuckled throatily. \"How is Maggie?\"\n\n\"She's fine.\"\n\n\"I mean as a date.\"\n\n\"Better than the car heater.\"\n\n\"Tim, you're a fool.\"\n\n\"When I was a kid,\" said Tim reflectively, \"there used to be a female\nsiren in the movies. Her pet line used to be 'Kiss me, my fool!' Theda\nBara, I think. Before talkies. Now--\"\n\n\"No, Tim--\"\n\nAnother long silence.\n\n\"Now, Tim, you've simply _got_ to go!\"\n\n\"Yeah, I know. You've convinced me.\"\n\n\"Then why aren't you going?\"\n\nHe chuckled. \"Look, you've convinced me. I can't stay so I'll go,\nobviously. But now that we've covered this problem, let's drop the\nsubject for a while, huh?\"\n\n\"Don't spoil a fine evening, Tim.\"\n\n\"Janet, what's with you, anyway?\"\n\n\"What do you mean, 'what's with me?'\"\n\n\"Just this. Somewhere up in the house is this oddball Maxwell who hides\nout all the time. He's either asleep or busy. Anyway, he isn't here. Do\nyou have to report in, punch a time clock, tuck him in--or do you turn\ninto a pumpkin at the stroke of twelve?\"\n\n\"Mr. Maxwell is paying me wages to keep house for him. That's all. Part\nof my wages is my keep. But it doesn't entitle me to have full run of the\nhouse or to bring guests in at midnight for a two-hour good-night\nsession.\"\n\n\"I'd like to tell this bird a thing or two,\" said Tim Fisher sharply. \"He\ncan't keep you cooped up like--like--\"\n\n\"Nobody is keeping me cooped up,\" she said. \"Like what?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You said 'like--'\"\n\n\"Skip it. What I meant is that you can't moulder, Janet. You've got to\nget out and meet people.\"\n\n\"I've been out and I've met people. I've met you.\"\n\n\"All to the good.\"\n\n\"Fine. So you invited me out, and I went. It was fun. I liked it. You've\nasked me, and I've said that I'd like to do it again on Saturday. I've\nenjoyed being kissed, and I'll probably enjoy it again on Saturday. So--\"\n\n\"I'd think you'd enjoy a lot of it.\"\n\n\"Because my husband has been gone for five years?\"\n\n\"Oh, now Janet--\"\n\n\"That's what you meant, isn't it?\"\n\n\"No. You've got me wrong.\"\n\n\"Tim, stop it. You're spoiling a fine evening. You should have gone\nbefore it started to spoil. Now please put your smile on again and leave\ncheerfully. There's always Saturday--if you still want it.\"\n\n\"I'll call you,\" he said.\n\nThe door opened once more and then closed. James took a deep breath, and\nthen stole away quietly to his own room.\n\nBy some instinct he knew that this was no time to intercept Mrs. Bagley\nwith a lot of fool questions.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo the surprise and puzzlement of young James Quincy Holden, Mr. Timothy\nFisher telephoned early upon the following evening. He was greeted quite\ncordially by Mrs. Bagley. Their conversation was rambling and inane,\nespecially when heard from one end only, and it took them almost ten\nminutes to confirm their Saturday night date. That came as another shock.\n\nWell, not quite. The explanation bothered him even more than the fact\nitself. As a further extension of his little mechanical mating process,\nJames had to find a place for the like of Jake Caslow and the women Jake\nknew. None of them were classed in the desirable group, all of them were\namong the leftovers. But of course, since none of them were good enough\nfor the 'good' people, they were good enough for one another, and that\nmade it all right--for them.\n\nBut Mrs. Bagley was not of their ilk. It was not right that she should be\nforced to take a leftover.\n\nAnd then it occurred to him that perhaps Mrs. Bagley was not really\ntaking the leftover, Tim Fisher, but instead was using Tim Fisher's\ncompany as a means toward meeting a larger group, from which there might\nbe a better specimen. So he bided his time, thinking deeply around the\nsubject, about which he knew nothing whatsoever.\n\nSaturday night was a repeat of Wednesday. They stayed out later, and upon\ntheir return they took possession of the living room for at least an hour\nbefore they started their routine about the going-home process. With\nminor variations in the dialog, and with longer and more frequent\nsilences, it almost followed the Wednesday night script. The variation\npuzzled James even more. This session went according to program for a\nwhile until Tim Fisher admitted with regret that it was, indeed, time for\nhim to depart. At which juncture Mrs. Bagley did not leap to her feet to\naccept his offer to do that which she had been asking him to do for a\nhalf hour. Mrs. Bagley compounded the affair by sighing deeply and\nagreeing with him that it was a shame that it was so late and that she,\ntoo, wished that he could stay a little longer. This, of course, put them\nprecisely where they were a half hour earlier and they had to start the\nsilly business all over again.\n\nThey parted after a final fifteen-minute discussion at the front door.\nThis discussion covered Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and finally came to\nagreement on Wednesday.\n\nAnd so James Holden went to bed that night fully convinced that in a town\nof approximately two thousand people--he did not count the two or three\nhundred A.E.C.-College group as part of the problem--there were entirely\ntoo few attractive leftovers from which Mrs. Bagley could choose.\n\nBut as this association grew, it puzzled him even more. For in his\nunderstanding, any person forced to accept a second-rate choice does so\nwith an air of resignation, but not with a cheerful smile, a sparkle in\nthe eyes, and two hours of primping.\n\nJames sought the answer in his books but they were the wrong volumes for\nreference of this subject. He considered the local Public Library only\nlong enough to remember that it carried a few hundred books suitable for\nthe A.E.C.-College crew and a thousand or so of second-hand culls donated\nby local citizens during cleanup campaigns. He resorted to buying books\nby mail through advertisements in newspapers and magazines and received a\nnumber of volumes of medical treatises, psychological texts, and a book\non obstetrics that convinced him that baby-having was both rare and\nhazardous. He read _By Love Possessed_ but he did not recognize the many\nforms of love portrayed by the author because the volume was not\nannotated with signs or provided with a road map, and he did not know\nit when he read about it.\n\nHe went through the Kinsey books and absorbed a lot of data and graphs\nand figures on human behavior that meant nothing to him. James was not\neven interested in the incidence of homosexuality among college students\nas compared to religious groups, or in the comparison between premarital\nexperience and level of education. He knew the words and what the words\nmeant as defined in other words. But they were only words and did not\ntouch him where he lived.\n\nSo, because none of the texts bothered to explain why a woman says Yes,\nwhen she means No, nor why a woman will cling to a man's lapels and press\nherself against him and at the same time tell him he has to go home,\nJames remained ignorant. He could have learned more from Lord Byron,\nShelley, Keats, or Browning than from Kinsey, deLee, or the \"Instructive\nbook on Sex, forwarded under plain wrapper for $2.69 postpaid.\"\n\nLuckily for James, he did not study any of his material via the medium of\nhis father's machine or it would have made him sick. For he was not yet\ncapable of understanding the single subject upon which more words have\nbeen expended in saying less than any other subject since the dawn of\nhistory.\n\nHis approach was academic, he could have been reading the definitive\nmaterial on the life-cycle of the beetle insofar as any stir of his own\nblood was concerned.\n\nFrom his study he did identify a couple of items. Tim Fisher obviously\ndesired extramarital relations with Mrs. Bagley--or was it premarital\nrelations? Probably both. Logic said that Mrs. Bagley, having already\nbeen married to Martha's father, could hardly enter into _pre_marital\nrelations, although Tim could, since he was a bachelor. But they wouldn't\nbe _pre_marital with Tim unless he followed through and married Mrs.\nBagley. And so they must be _extra_marital. But whatever they were\ncalled, the Book said that there was about as much on one side as on the\nother.\n\nWith a mind mildly aware of the facts of life, distorted through the eyes\nof near-nine James Holden, he watched them and listened in.\n\nAs for Mrs. Bagley, she did not know that she was providing part of James\nHolden's extraliterary education. She enjoyed the company of Tim Fisher.\nHesitantly, she asked James if she could have Tim for dinner one evening,\nand was a bit surprised at his immediate assent. They planned the\nevening, cleaned the lower part of the house of every trace of its\ncurrent occupancy, and James and Martha hied themselves upstairs. Dinner\nwent with candlelight and charcoal-broiled steak--and a tray taken aloft\nfor \"Mr. Maxwell\" was consumed by James and Martha. The evening went\nsmoothly. They listened to music and danced, they sat and talked. And\nJames listened.\n\nTim was not the same man. He sat calm and comfortably on the low sofa\nwith Mrs. Bagley's head on his shoulder, both of them pleasantly bemused\nby the dancing fireplace and with each other's company. He said, \"Well,\nI'm glad this finally happened.\"\n\n\"What happened?\" she replied in a murmur.\n\n\"Getting the invite for dinner.\"\n\n\"Might have been sooner, I suppose. Sorry.\"\n\n\"What took you so long?\"\n\n\"Just being cautious, I guess.\"\n\nHe chuckled. \"Cautious?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh.\"\n\nTim laughed.\n\n\"What's so darned funny?\"\n\n\"Women.\"\n\n\"Are we such a bunch of clowns?\"\n\n\"Not clowns, Janet. Just funny.\"\n\n\"All right, genius. Explain that.\"\n\n\"A woman is a lovely creature who sends a man away so that he can't do\nwhat she wants him to do most of all.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh.\"\n\n\"She feeds him full of rare steak until he wants to crawl off in a corner\nlike the family mutt and go to sleep. Once she gets him in a somnolent\nstate, she drapes herself tastefully on his shoulder and gets soft and\nwarm and willing.\"\n\nMrs. Bagley laughed throatily. \"Just start getting active,\" she warned,\n\"and you'll see how fast I can beat a hasty retreat.\"\n\n\"Janet, what _is_ with you?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"What are you hiding?\"\n\n\"Hiding?\"\n\n\"Yes, confound it, hiding!\" he said, his voice turning hard. \"Just who is\nthis Charles Maxwell character, anyway?\"\n\n\"Tim, please--\"\n\nHis voice lowered again. \"Janet,\" he said softly, \"you're asking me to\ntrust you, and at the same time you're not trusting me.\"\n\n\"But I've nothing to hide.\"\n\n\"Oh, stop it. I'm no schoolboy, Janet. If you have nothing to hide, why\nare you acting as if you were sitting on the lid?\"\n\n\"I still don't know what you're talking about.\"\n\n\"Your words say so, but your tone is the icy haughtiness that dares me,\nmere male that I am, to call your lie. I've a half-notion to stomp\nupstairs and confront your mysterious Maxwell--if he indeed exists.\"\n\n\"You mustn't. He'd--\"\n\n\"He'd what? I've been in this house for hours day and night and now all\nevening. I've never heard a sound, not the creak of a floorboard, the\nslam of a door, the opening of a window, nor the distant gurgle of cool,\nclear water, gushing into plumbing. So you've been married. This I know.\nYou have a daughter. This I accept. Your husband is dead. This happens to\npeople every day; nice people, bad people, bright people, dull people.\nThere was a young boy here last summer. Him I do not know, but you and\nyour daughter I do know about. I've checked--\"\n\n\"How dare you check--?\"\n\n\"I damn well dare check anything and anybody I happen to be personally\ninterested in,\" he stormed. \"As a potential bed partner I wouldn't give a\nhoot who you were or what you were. But before I go to the point of\ndividing the rest of my life on an exclusive contract, I have the right\nto know what I'm splitting it with.\"\n\n\"You have no right--\"\n\n\"Balderdash! I have as much right as anybody to look at the record. I\ngrant you the same right to look up my family and my friends and the\nstatus of my bank account and my credit rating and my service record.\nGrant it? Hell, I couldn't stop you. Now, what's going on? Where is your\ndaughter and where is that little boy? And where--if he exists--is this\nCharles Maxwell?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJames had heard enough. No matter which way this was going, it would end\nup wrong. He was proud of Mrs. Bagley's loyalty, but he knew that it was\nan increasing strain and could very well lead to complications that could\nnot be explained away without the whole truth. He decided that the only\nthing to do was to put in his own oar and relieve Mrs. Bagley.\n\nHe walked in, yawning. He stood between them, facing Tim Fisher. Behind\nhim, Mrs. Bagley cried, \"Now see--you've awakened him!\"\n\nIn a dry-throated voice, Tim said, \"I thought he was away at school. Now,\nwhat's the story?\"\n\n\"It isn't her story to tell,\" said James. \"It's mine.\"\n\n\"Now see here--\"\n\n\"Mr. Fisher, you can't learn anything by talking incessantly.\"\n\nTim Fisher took a step forward, his face dark, his intention to shake the\ntruth out of somebody. James held up a hand. \"Sit down a moment and\nlisten,\" he ordered.\n\nThe sight of James and the words that this child was uttering stopped Tim\nFisher. Puzzled, he nodded dumbly, found a chair, and sat on the front\nedge of it, poised.\n\n\"The whereabouts of Mr. Maxwell is his own business and none of yours.\nYour criticism is unfounded and your suspicions unworthy. But since you\ntake the attitude that this is some of your business, we don't mind\ntelling you that Mr. Maxwell is in New York on business.\"\n\nTim Fisher eyed the youngster. \"I thought you were away at school,\" he\nrepeated.\n\n\"I heard you the first time,\" said James. \"Obviously, I am not. Why I am\nnot is Mr. Maxwell's business, not yours. And by insisting that something\nis wrong here and demanding the truth, you have placed Mrs. Bagley in the\nawkward position of having to make a decision that divides her loyalties.\nShe has had the complete trust of Mr. Maxwell for almost a year and a\nhalf. Now, tell me, Mr. Fisher, to whom shall she remain loyal?\"\n\n\"That isn't the point--\"\n\n\"Yes, it is the point, Mr. Fisher. It is exactly the point. You're asking\nMrs. Bagley to tell you the details of her employer's business, which is\nunethical.\"\n\n\"How much have you heard?\" demanded Fisher crossly.\n\n\"Enough, at least to know what you've been hammering at.\"\n\n\"Then you know that I've as much as said that there was some suspicion\nattached.\"\n\n\"Suspicion of what?\"\n\n\"Well, why aren't you in school?\"\n\n\"That's Mr. Maxwell's business.\"\n\n\"Let me tell you, youngster, it is more than your Mr. Maxwell's business.\nThere are laws about education and he's breaking them.\"\n\nJames said patiently: \"The law states that every child shall receive an\nadequate education. The precise wording I do not know, but it does\nprovide for schooling outside of the state school system if the parent or\nguardian so prefers, and providing that such extraschool education is\ndeemed adequate by the state. Can you say that I am not properly\neducated, Mr. Fisher?\"\n\n\"Well, you'd hardly expect me to be an expert on the subject.\"\n\n\"Then I'd hardly expect you to pass judgment, either,\" said James\npointedly.\n\n\"You're pretty--\" Tim Fisher caught his tongue at the right moment. He\nfelt his neck getting hot. It is hard enough to be told that you are\noff-base and that your behavior has been bad when an adult says the\ndamning words. To hear the same words from a ten-year-old is unbearable.\nRight or wrong, the adult's position is to turn aside or shut the child\nup either by pulling rank or cuffing the young offender with an open\nhand. To have this upstart defend Mrs. Bagley, in whose presence he could\nhardly lash back, put Mr. Fisher in a very unhappy state of mind. He\nswallowed and then asked, lamely, \"Why does he have to be so furtive?\"\n\n\"What is your definition of 'furtive'?\" asked James calmly. \"Do you\nemploy the same term to describe the operations of that combination\nCollege-A.E.C. installation on the other side of town?\"\n\n\"That's secret--\"\n\n\"Implying that atomic energy is secretly above-board, legal, and\nhonorable, whereas Mr. Maxwell's--\"\n\n\"But we know about atomic energy.\"\n\n\"Sure we do,\" jeered James, and the sound of his immature near-treble\nvoice made the jeer very close to an insult. \"We know _all_ about atomic\nenergy. Was the Manhattan Project called 'furtive' until Hiroshima gave\nthe story away?\"\n\n\"You're trying to put words in my mouth,\" objected Tim.\n\n\"No, I'm not. I'm merely trying to make you understand something\nimportant to everybody. You come in here and claim by the right of\npersonal interest that we should be most willing to tell you our\nbusiness. Then in the next breath you defend the installation over on the\nother side of town for their attitude in giving the bum's rush to people\nwho try to ask questions about their business. Go read your Constitution,\nMr. Fisher. It says there that I have as much right to defend my home\nagainst intruders as the A.E.C. has to defend their home against spies.\"\n\n\"But I'm not intruding.\"\n\nJames nodded his head gently. \"Not,\" he said, \"until you make the grave\nerror of equating personal privacy with culpable guilt.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean that.\"\n\n\"You should learn to say what you mean,\" said James, \"instead of trying\nto pry information out of someone who happens to be fond of you.\"\n\n\"Now see here,\" said Tim Fisher, \"I happen to be fond of her too, you\nknow. Doesn't that give me some rights?\"\n\n\"Would you expect to know all of her business if she were your wife?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"Suppose she were working in the A.E.C.-College?\"\n\n\"Well, that--er--\"\n\n\"Would be different?\"\n\n\"Well, now--\"\n\n\"I talked this right around in its circle for a purpose,\" said James.\n\"Stop and think for a moment. Let's discuss me. Mr. Fisher, where would\nyou place me in school?\"\n\n\"Er--how old are you?\"\n\n\"Nine,\" said James. \"In April.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm not sure--\"\n\n\"Exactly. Do you suppose that I could sit in a classroom among my\nnine-year-old contemporaries very long without being found out?\"\n\n\"Er--no--I suppose not.\"\n\n\"Mr. Fisher, how long do you think I could remain a secret if I attended\nhigh school, sitting at a specially installed desk in a class among\nteenagers twice my size?\"\n\n\"Not very long.\"\n\n\"Then remember that some secrets are so big that you have to have armed\nguards to keep them secret, and others are so easy to conceal that all\nyou need is a rambling old house and a plausible fa\u00e7ade.\"\n\n\"Why have you told me all this?\"\n\n\"Because you have penetrated this far by your own effort, justified by\nyour own personal emotions, and driven by an urge that is all-powerful if\nI am to believe the books I've read on the subject. You are told this\nmuch of the truth so that you won't go off half-cocked with a fine\ncollection of rather dangerous untruths. Understand?\"\n\n\"I'm beginning to.\"\n\n\"Well, whether Mrs. Bagley accepts your offer of marriage or not,\nremember one thing: If she were working for the A.E.C. you'd be proud of\nher, and you'd also be quite careful not to ask questions that would\ncause her embarrassment.\"\n\nTim Fisher looked at Mrs. Bagley. \"Well?\" he asked.\n\nMrs. Bagley looked bleak. \"Please don't ask me until I've had a chance to\ndiscuss all of the angles with Mr. Maxwell, Tim.\"\n\n\"Maxwell, again.\"\n\n\"Tim,\" she said in a quiet voice, \"remember--he's an employer, not an\nemotional involvement.\"\n\nJames Holden looked at Tim Fisher. \"And if you'll promise to keep this\nthing as close a secret as you would some information about atomic\nenergy, I'll go to bed and let you settle your personal problems in\nprivate. Good night!\"\n\nHe left, reasonably satisfied that Tim Fisher would probably keep their\nsecret for a time, at least. The hinted suggestion that this was as\nimportant a government project as the Atomic Energy Commission's works\nwould prevent casual talk. There was also the slim likelihood that Tim\nFisher might enjoy the position of being on the inside of a big secret,\nalthough this sort of inner superiority lacks true satisfaction. There\nwas a more solid chance that Tim Fisher, being the ambitious man that he\nwas, would keep their secret in the hope of acquiring for himself some\nof the superior knowledge and the advanced ability that went with it.\n\nBut James was certain that the program that had worked so well with Mrs.\nBagley would fail with Tim Fisher. James had nothing material to offer\nTim. Tim was the kind of man who would insist upon his wife being a\nfull-time wife, physically, emotionally, and intellectually.\n\nAnd James suddenly realized that Tim Fisher's own ambition and character\nwould insist that Mrs. Bagley, with Martha, leave James Holden to take up\nresidence in a home furnished by Tim Fisher upon the date and at time she\nbecame Mrs. Timothy Fisher.\n\nHe was still thinking about the complications this would cause when he\nheard Tim leave. His clock said three-thirty.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJames Holden's mechanical educator was a wonderful machine, but there\nwere some aspects of knowledge that it was not equipped to impart. The\nglandular comprehension of love was one such; there were others. In all\nof his hours under the machine James had not learned how personalities\nchange and grow.\n\nAnd yet there was a textbook case right before his eyes.\n\nIn a few months, Janet Bagley had changed from a frightened and\nbelligerent mother-animal to a cheerful young prospective wife. The\nimportance of the change lay in the fact that it was not polar, nothing\nreversed; it was only that the emphasis passed gradually from the\nprotection of the young to the development of Janet Bagley herself.\n\nJames could not very well understand, though he tried, but he couldn't\nmiss seeing it happen. It was worrisome. It threatened complications.\n\nThere was quite a change that came with Tim Fisher's elevation in status\nfrom steady date to affianced husband, heightened by Tim Fisher's partial\nunderstanding of the situation at Martin's Hill.\n\nThen, having assumed the right to drop in as he pleased, he went on to\nassume more \"rights\" as Mrs. Bagley's fianc\u00e9. He brought in his friends\nfrom time to time. Not without warning, of course, for he understood the\nneed for secrecy. When he brought friends it was after warning, and very\nfrequently after he had helped them to remove the traces of juvenile\noccupancy from the lower part of the house.\n\nIn one way, this took some of the pressure off. The opening of the\n\"hermit's\" house to the friends of the \"hermit's\" housekeeper's fianc\u00e9\nand friends was a pleasant evidence of good will; people stopped\nwondering, a little.\n\nOn the other hand, James did not wholly approve. He contrasted this with\nwhat he remembered of his own home life. The guests who came to visit his\nmother and father were quiet and earnest. They indulged in animated\ndiscussions, argued points of deep reasoning, and in moments of\nrelaxation they indulged in games that demanded skill and intellect.\n\nTim Fisher's friends were noisy and boisterous. They mixed highballs.\nThey danced to music played so loud that it made the house throb. They\nwatched the fights on television and argued with more volume than logic.\n\nThey were, to young James, a far cry from his parents' friends.\n\nBut, as he couldn't do anything about it, he refused to worry about it.\nJames Holden turned his thoughts forward and began to plan how he was\ngoing to face the culmination of this romance next September Fifteenth.\nHe even suspected that there would probably be a number of knotty little\nproblems that he now knew nothing about; he resolved to allow some\nthinking-time to cope with them when, as, and if.\n\nIn the meantime, the summer was coming closer.\n\nHe prepared to make a visible show of having Mr. Charles Maxwell leave\nfor a protracted summer travel. This would ease the growing problem of\nproviding solid evidence of Maxwell's presence during the increasing\nfrequency of Tim Fisher's visits and the widening circle of Mrs. Bagley's\nacquaintances in Shipmont. At the same time he and Martha would make a\nreturn from the Bolton School for Youth. This would allow them their\nfreedom for the summer; for the first time James looked forward to it.\nMartha Bagley was progressing rapidly. This summer would see her over and\ndone with the scatter-brain prattle that gave equal weight to fact or\nfancy. Her store of information was growing; she could be relied upon to\nmaintain a fairly secure cover. Her logic was not to James Holden's\ncomplete satisfaction but she accepted most of his direction as necessary\ninformation to be acted upon now and reasoned later.\n\nIn the solving of his immediate problems, James can be forgiven for\nputting Paul Brennan out of his mind.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\n\n\nBut Paul Brennan was still alive, and he had not forgotten.\n\nWhile James was, with astonishing success, building a life for himself in\nhiding, Brennan did everything he could to find him. That is to say, he\ndid everything that--under the circumstances--he could afford to do.\n\nThe thing was, the boy had got clean away, without a trace.\n\nWhen James escaped for the third, and very successful, time, Brennan was\nhelpless. James had planned well. He had learned from his first two\nefforts. The first escape was a blind run toward a predictable objective;\nall right, that was a danger to be avoided. His second was entirely\nsuccessful--until James created his own area of danger. Another lesson\nlearned.\n\nThe third was planned with as much care as Napoleon's deliverance from\nthe island.\n\nJames had started by choosing his time. He'd waited until Easter Week.\nHe'd had a solid ten days during which he would be only one of countless\nthousands of children on the streets; there would be no slight suspicion\nbecause he was out when others were in.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJames didn't go to school that day. That was common; children in the\nlower grades are often absent, and no one asks a question until they\nreturn, with the proper note from the parent. He was not missed anywhere\nuntil the school bus that should have dropped him off did not. This was\nan area of weakness that Brennan could not plug; he could hardly justify\nthe effort of delivering and fetching the lad to and from school when the\npublic school bus passed the Holden home. Brennan relied upon the\nMitchells to see James upon the bus and to check him off when he\nreturned. Whether James would have been missed earlier even with a\npersonal delivery is problematical; certainly James would have had to\nconcoct some other scheme to gain him his hours of free time.\n\nAt any rate, the first call to the school connected the Mitchells with a\ngrumpy-voiced janitor who growled that teachers and principals had headed\nfor their hills of freedom and wouldn't be back until Monday Week. It\ntook some calling to locate a couple of James Holden's classmates who\nasserted that he hadn't been in school that day.\n\nPaul Brennan knew at once what had happened, but he could not raise an\nimmediate hue-and-cry. He fretted because of the Easter Week vacation; in\nany other time the sight of a school-aged boy free during school hours\nwould have caused suspicion. During Easter Week vacation, every schoolboy\nwould be free. James would also be protected by his size. A youngster\nwalking alone is not suspect; his folks _must_ be close by. The fact that\nit was \"again\" placed Paul Brennan in an undesirable position. This was\nnot the youthful adventure that usually ends about three blocks from\nhome. This was a repeat of the first absence during which James had been\nmissing for months. People smile at the parents of the child who packs\nhis little bag with a handkerchief and a candy bar to sally forth into\nthe great big world, but it becomes another matter when the lad of six\nleaves home with every appearance of making it stick. So Brennan had to\nplay it cozy, inviting newspaper reporters to the Holden home to display\nwhat he had to offer young James and giving them free rein to question\nBrennan's housekeeper and general factotum, the Mitchells. With\nhonest-looking zeal, Paul Brennan succeeded in building up a picture that\ndepicted James as ungrateful, hard to understand, wilful, and something\nof an intellectual brat.\n\nThen the authorities proceeded to throw out a fine-mesh dragnet. They\nquestioned and cross-questioned bus drivers and railroad men. They made\ncontact with the local airport even though its facilities were only used\nfor a daisy-cutting feeder line. Posters were printed and sent to all\ntruck lines for display to the truck drivers. The roadside diners were\ncovered thoroughly. And knowing the boy's ability to talk convincingly,\nthe authorities even went so far as to try the awesome project of making\ncontact with passengers bound out-of-town with young male children in\ntow.\n\nHad James given them no previous experience to think about, he would have\nbeen merely considered a missing child and not a deliberate runaway.\nThen, instead of dragging down all of the known avenues of standard\nescape, the townspeople would have organized a tree-by-tree search of the\nfields and woods with hundreds of men walking hand in hand to inspect\nevery square foot of the ground for either tracks or the child himself.\nBut the _modus operandi_ of young James Holden had been to apply sly\ntouches such as writing letters and forging signatures of adults to\ncause the unquestioned sale of railroad tickets, or the unauthorized ride\nin the side-door Pullman.\n\nTherefore, while the authorities were extending their circle of search\nbased upon the velocity of modern transportation, James Holden was making\nhis slow way across field and stream, guided by a Boy Scout compass and a\nU.S. Geodetic Survey map to keep him well out of the reach of roadway or\ntown. With difficulty, but with dogged determination, he carried a light\ncot-blanket into which he had rolled four cans of pork and beans. He had\na Boy Scout knife and a small pair of pliers to open it with. He had\nmatches. He had the Boy Scout Handbook which was doubly useful; the pages\ndevoted to woodsman's lore he kept for reference, the pages wasted on the\nqualifications for merit badges he used to start fires. He enjoyed\nsleeping in the open because it was spring and pleasantly warm, and\nbecause the Boy Scout Manual said that camping out was fun.\n\nA grown man with an objective can cover thirty or forty miles per day\nwithout tiring. James made it ten to fifteen. Thus, by the time the\norganized search petered out for lack of evidence and manpower--try\nasking one question of everybody within a hundred-mile radius--James was\nquietly making his way, free of care, like a hardy pioneer looking for a\nhomestead site.\n\nThe hint of kidnap went out early. The Federal Bureau of Investigation,\nof course, could not move until the waiting period was ended, but they\ndid collect information and set up their organization ready to move\ninto high speed at the instant of legal time. But then no ransom letter\ncame; no evidence of the crime of kidnapping. This did not close the\ncase; there were other cases on record where a child was stolen by adults\nfor purposes other than ransom. It was not very likely that a child of\nsix would be stolen by a neurotic adult to replace a lost infant, and\nPaul Brennan was personally convinced that James Holden had enough\nself-reliance to make such a kidnap attempt fail rather early in the\ngame. He could hardly say so, nor could he suggest that James had indeed\nrun away deliberately and skilfully, and with planned steps worthy of a\nmuch older person. He could only hint and urge the F.B.I. into any action\nthat he could coerce them into taking; he did not care how or who brought\nJames back just so long as the child was returned to his custody.\n\nThen as the days wore into weeks with no sign, the files were placed\nin the inactive drawer. Paul Brennan made contact with a few private\nagencies.\n\nHe was stopped here, again, by another angle. The Holdens were by no\nmeans wealthy. Brennan could not justify the offer of some reward so\nlarge that people simply could not turn down the slim chance of\ncollecting. If the missing one is heir to a couple of million dollars,\nthe trustees can justify a reward of a good many thousand dollars for his\nreturn. The amount that Brennan was prepared to offer could not compel\nthe services of a private agency on a full-time basis. The best and the\nmost interested of the agencies took the case on a contingent basis; if\nsomething turned their way in the due course of their work they'd\nimmediately take steps. Solving the case of a complete disappearance on\nthe part of a child who virtually vanished into thin air would be good\nadvertising, but their advertising budget would not allow them to put one\nman on the case without the first shred of evidence to point the way.\n\nIf Paul Brennan had been above-board, he could have evoked a lot of\ninterest. The search for a six-year-old boy with the educational\ndevelopment of a youth of about eighteen, informed through the services\nof an electromechanical device, would have fired public interest,\nGovernment intervention, and would also have justified Paul Brennan's\ndepth of interest. But Paul Brennan could say nothing about the excellent\ntraining, he could only hint at James Holden's mental proficiency which\nwas backed up by the boy's school record. As it was, Paul Brennan's\nmost frightful nightmare was one where young James was spotted by some\neagle-eyed detective and then in desperation--anything being better than\nan enforced return to Paul Brennan--James Holden pulled out all the stops\nand showed everybody precisely how well educated he really was.\n\nIn his own affairs, Paul still had to make a living, which took up his\ntime. As guardian and trustee of the Holden Estate, he was responsible to\nthe State for his handling of James Holden's inheritance. The State takes\na sensible view of the disbursements of the inheritance of a minor.\nReasonable sums may be spent on items hardly deemed necessities to the\naverage person, but the ceiling called \"reasonable\" is a flexible term\nand subject to close scrutiny by the State.\n\nIn the long run it was Paul Brennan's own indefensible position that made\nit impossible to prosecute a proper search for the missing James Holden.\nBrennan suspected James of building up a bank account under some false\nname, but he could not saunter into banks and ask to examine their\nrecords without a Court order. Brennan knew that James had not taken off\nwithout preparation, but the examination of the stuff that James left\nbehind was not very informative. There was a small blanket missing and\nMrs. Mitchell said that it looked as though some cans had been removed\nfrom the stock but she could not be sure. And in a large collection of\nboy's stuff, one would not observe the absence of a Boy Scout knife and\nother trivia. Had a 100% inventory been available, the list of missing\nitems would have pointed out James Holden's avenue of escape.\n\nThe search for an adult would have included questioning of banks. No one\nknows whether such a questioning would have uncovered the bank-by-mail\nroutine conducted under the name of Charles Maxwell. It is not a regular\nthing, but the receipt of a check drawn on a New York bank, issued by a\npublishing company, and endorsed to be paid to the account of so-and-so,\naccompanied by a request to open an account in that name might never be\nconnected with the manipulations of a six-year-old genius, who was\novertly just plain bright.\n\nAnd so Paul Brennan worried himself out of several pounds for fear\nthat James would give himself away to the right people. He cursed the\nnecessity of keeping up his daily work routine. The hue-and-cry he could\nnot keep alive, but he knew that somewhere there was a young boy entirely\ncapable of reconstructing the whole machine that Paul Brennan wanted so\ndesperately that he had killed for it.\n\nPaul Brennan was blocked cold. With the F.B.I. maintaining a hands-off\nattitude because there was no trace of any Federal crime involved, the\ncase of James Holden was relegated to the missing-persons files. It\nbecame the official opinion that the lad had suffered some mishap and\nthat it would only be a matter of time before his body was discovered.\nPaul Brennan could hardly prove them wrong without explaining the whole\nsecret of James Holden's intelligence, competence, and the certainty that\nthe young man would improve upon both as soon as he succeeded in\nrebuilding the Holden Electromechanical Educator.\n\nWith the F.B.I. out of the picture, the local authorities waiting for the\ndiscovery of a small body, and the state authorities shelving the case\nexcept for the routine punch-card checks, official action died. Brennan's\navailable reward money was not enough to buy a private agency's interest\nfull-time.\n\nBrennan could not afford to tell anybody of his suspicion of James\nHolden's source of income, for the idea of a child's making a living by\nwriting would be indefensible without full explanation. However, Paul\nBrennan resorted to reading of magazines edited for boys. Month after\nmonth he bought them and read them, comparing the styles of the many\nwriters against the style of the manuscript copy left behind by James.\n\nBrennan naturally assumed that James would use a pen name. Writers often\nused pen names to conceal their own identity for any one of several\nreasons. A writer might use three or more pen names, each one identified\nwith a known style of writing, or a certain subject or established\ncharacter. But Paul Brennan did not know all there was to know about the\npen-name business, such as an editor assigning a pen name to prevent the\ntoo-often appearance of some prolific writer, or conversely to make one\nwriter's name seem exclusive with his magazine; nor could Brennan know\nthat a writer's literary standing can be kept high by assigning a pen\nname to any second-rate material he may be so unfortunate as to turn out.\n\nPaul Brennan read many stories written by James Holden under several\nnames, including the name of Charles Maxwell, but Brennan's\nidentification according to literary style was no better than if he had\ntossed a coin.\n\nAnd so, blocked by his own guilt and avarice from making use of the legal\navenues of approach, Paul Brennan fumed and fretted away four long years\nwhile James Holden grew from six to ten years old, hiding under the guise\nof the Hermit of Martin's Hill and behind the pleasant adult fa\u00e7ade of\nMrs. Janet Bagley.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWELVE\n\n\nIf Paul Brennan found himself blocked in his efforts to find James Holden\nand the re-created Holden Educator, James himself was annoyed by one\nevident fact: Everything he did resulted in spreading the news of the\nmachine itself.\n\nHad he been eighteen or so, he might have made out to his own taste. In\nthe days of late teen-age, a youth can hold a job and rent a room, buy\nhis own clothing and conduct himself to the limit of his ability. At ten\nhe is suspect, because no one will permit him to paddle his own canoe. At\na later age James could have rented a small apartment and built his\nmachine alone. But starting as young as he did, he was forced to hide\nbehind the cover of some adult, and he had picked Mrs. Bagley because he\ncould control her both through her desire for security and the promise of\na fine education for the daughter Martha Bagley.\n\nThe daughter was a two-way necessity; she provided him with a\ncontemporary companion and also gave him a lever to wield against the\nadult. A lone woman could have made her way without trouble. A lone woman\nwith a girl-child is up against a rather horrifying problem of providing\nboth support and parental care. He felt that he had done what he had to\ndo, up to the point where Mrs. Bagley became involved with Tim Fisher or\nanybody else. This part of adulthood was not yet within his grasp.\n\nBut there it was and here it is, and now there was Martha to complicate\nthe picture. Had Mrs. Bagley been alone, she and Tim could go off and\nmarry and then settle down in Timbuctoo if they wanted to. But not with\nMartha. She was in the same intellectual kettle of sardines as James. Her\ntaste in education was by no means the same. She took to the mathematical\nsubjects indifferently, absorbing them well enough--once she could be\ntalked into spending the couple of hours that each day demanded--but\nwithout interest. Martha could rattle off quotations from literary\nmasters, she could follow the score of most operas (her voice was a bit\noff-key but she knew what was going on) and she enjoyed all of the\navailable information on keeping a house in order. Her eye and her mind\nwere, as James Holden's, faster than her hand. She went through the same\nfrustrations as he did, with different tools and in a different medium.\nThe first offside snick of the scissors she knew to be bad before she\ntried the pattern for size, and the only way she could correct such\ndefective work was to practice and practice until her muscles were\ntrained enough to respond to the direction of her mind.\n\nRemove her now and place her in a school--even the most advanced\nschool--and she would undergo the unhappy treatment that James had\nundergone these several years ago.\n\nAnd yet she could not be cut loose. Martha was as much a part of this\nvery strange life as James was. So this meant that any revision in\noverall policy must necessarily include the addition of Tim Fisher and\nnot the subtraction of Mrs. Bagley and Martha.\n\n\"Charles Maxwell\" had to go.\n\nJames's problem had not changed. His machine must be kept a secret as\nlong as he could. The machine was his, James Quincy Holden's property by\nevery known and unwritten legal right of direct, single, uncluttered\ninheritance. The work of his parents had been stopped by their death, but\nit was by no means finished with the construction of the machine. To the\ncontrary, the real work had only begun with the completion of the first\nworking model. And whether he turned out to be a machine-made genius, an\nover-powered dolt, or an introverted monster it was still his own\npersonal reason for being alive.\n\nHe alone should reap the benefit or the sorrow, and had his parents lived\nthey would have had their right to reap good or bad with him. Good or\nbad, had they lived, he would have received their protection.\n\nAs it was, he had no protection whatsoever. Until he could have and hold\nthe right to control his own property as he himself saw fit, he had to\nhide just as deep from the enemy who would steal it as he must hide from\nthe friend who would administrate it as a property in escrow for his own\ngood, since he as a minor was legally unable to walk a path both fitting\nand proper for his feet.\n\nSo, the facts had to be concealed. Yet all he was buying was time.\n\nBy careful juggling, he had already bought some. Months with Jake Caslow,\na few months stolidly fighting the school, and two with the help of Mrs.\nBagley and Martha. Then in these later months there had been more\npurchased time; time gained by the post-dated engagement and the\nprocrastinated marriage, which was now running out.\n\nNo matter what he did, it seemed that the result was a wider spread of\nknowledge about the Holden Electromechanical Educator.\n\nSo with misgiving and yet unaware of any way or means to circumvent the\nnecessity without doing more overall harm, James decided that Tim Fisher\nmust be handed another piece of the secret. A plausible piece, with as\nmuch truth as he would accept for the time being. Maybe--hand Tim Fisher\na bit with great gesture and he would not go prying for the whole?\n\nHis chance came in mid-August. It was after dinner on an evening\nuncluttered with party or shower or the horde of just-dropped-in-friends\nof whom Tim Fisher had legion.\n\nJanet Bagley and Tim Fisher sat on the low divan in the living room\nhalf-facing each other. Apart, but just so far apart that they could\ntouch with half a gesture, they were discussing the problem of domicile.\nThey were also still quibbling mildly about the honeymoon. Tim Fisher\nwanted a short, noisy one. A ten-day stay in Hawaii, flying both ways,\nwith a ten-hour stopover in Los Angeles on the way back. Janet Bagley\nwanted a long and lazy stay somewhere no closer than fifteen hundred\nmiles to the nearest telephone, newspaper, mailbox, airline, bus stop, or\nhighway. She'd take the 762-day rocket trip to Venus if they had one\navailable. Tim was duly sympathetic to her desire to get away from her\ndaily grind for as long a time as possible, but he also had a garage to\nrun, and he was by no means incapable of pointing out the practical side\nof crass commercialism.\n\nBut unlike the problem of the honeymoon, which Janet Bagley was willing\nto discuss on any terms for the pleasure of discussing it, the problem of\ndomicile had been avoided--to the degree of being pointed.\n\nFor Janet Bagley was still torn between two loyalties. Hers was not\na lone loyalty to James Holden, there had been almost a complete\nassociation with the future of her daughter in the loyalty. She realized\nas well as James did, that Martha must not be wrested from this life and\nforced to live, forever an outcast, raised mentally above the level of\nher age and below the physical size of her mental development. Mrs.\nBagley thought only of Martha's future; she gave little or no thought on\nthe secondary part of the problem. But James knew that once Martha was\nseparated from the establishment, she could not long conceal her advanced\ninformation, and revealing that would reveal its source.\n\nAnd so, as they talked together with soft voices, James Holden decided\nthat he could best buy time by employing logic, finance, and good common\nsense. He walked into the living room and sat across the coffee table\nfrom them. He said, \"You'll have to live here, you know.\"\n\nThe abrupt statement stunned them both. Tim sat bolt upright and\nobjected, \"I'll see to it that we're properly housed, young fellow.\"\n\n\"This isn't charity,\" replied James. \"Nor the goodness of my little\nheart. It's a necessity.\"\n\n\"How so?\" demanded Tim crossly. \"It's my life--and Janet's.\"\n\n\"And--Martha's life,\" added James.\n\n\"You don't think I'm including her out, do you?\"\n\n\"No, but you're forgetting that she isn't to be popped here and there as\nthe fancy hits you, either. She's much to be considered.\"\n\n\"I'll consider her,\" snapped Tim. \"She shall be my daughter. If she will,\nI'll have her use my name as well as my care and affection.\"\n\n\"Of course you will,\" agreed James. The quick gesture of Mrs. Bagley's\nhand towards Tim, and his equally swift caress in reply were noticed but\nnot understood by James. \"But you're not thinking deeply enough about\nit.\"\n\n\"All right. You tell me all about it.\"\n\n\"Martha must stay here,\" said James. \"Neither of you--nor Martha--have\nany idea of how stultifying it can be to be forced into school under the\nsupervision of teachers who cannot understand, and among classmates\nwhose grasp of any subject is no stronger than a feeble grope in the\nmental dawn.\"\n\n\"Maybe so. But that's no reason why we must run our life your way.\"\n\n\"You're wrong, Mr. Fisher. Think a moment. Without hesitation, you will\ninclude the education of Martha Bagley along with the 'care and\naffection' you mentioned a moment ago.\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"This means, Mr. Fisher, that Martha, approaching ten years old,\nrepresents a responsibility of about seven more years prior to her\ngraduation from high school and another four years of college--granting\nthat Martha is a standard, normal, healthy young lady. Am I right?\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\n\"Well, since you are happy and willing to take on the responsibility of\neleven years of care and affection and the expense of schooling the girl,\nyou might as well take advantage of the possibilities here and figure on\nfive years--or less. If we cannot give her the equal of a master's degree\nin three, I'm shooting in the dark. Make it five, and she'll have her\ndoctor's degree--or at least it's equivalent. Does that make sense?\"\n\n\"Of course it does. But--\"\n\n\"No buts until we're finished. You'll recall the tales we told you about\nthe necessity of hiding out. It must continue. During the school year we\nmust not be visible to the general public.\"\n\n\"But dammit, I don't want to set up my family in someone else's house,\"\nobjected Tim Fisher.\n\n\"Buy this one,\" suggested James. \"Then it will be yours. I'll stay on and\npay rent on my section.\"\n\n\"You'll--now wait a minute! What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"I said, _'I'll pay rent on my section,'_\" said James.\n\n\"But this guy upstairs--\" Tim took a long breath. \"Let's get this\nstraight,\" he said, \"now that we're on the subject, what about Mr.\nCharles Maxwell?\"\n\n\"I can best quote,\" said James with a smile, \"'Oh, what a tangled web we\nweave, when first we practice to deceive!'\"\n\n\"That's Shakespeare.\"\n\n\"Sorry. That's Sir Walter Scott. _The Lay of the Last Minstrel_. Canto\nSix, Stanza Seventeen. The fact of the matter is that we could go on\ncompounding this lie, but it's time to stop it. Mr. Charles Maxwell\ndoes not exist.\"\n\n\"I don't understand!\"\n\n\"Hasn't it puzzled you that this hermit-type character that never puts a\nfoot out of the house has been out and gone on some unstated vacation or\nbusiness trip for most of the spring and summer?\"\n\n\"Hadn't given it a thought,\" said Fisher with a fatuous look at Mrs.\nBagley. She mooned back at him. For a moment they were lost in one\nanother, giving proof to the idea that blinder than he who will not\nsee is the fellow who has his eye on a woman.\n\n\"Charles Maxwell does not exist except in the minds of his happy\nreaders,\" said James. \"He is a famous writer of boys' stories and known\nto a lot of people for that talent. Yet he is no more a real person\nthan Lewis Carroll.\"\n\n\"But Lewis Carroll did exist--\"\n\n\"As Charles L. Dodgson, a mathematician famous for his work in symbolic\nlogic.\"\n\n\"All right! Then who writes these stories? Who supports you--and this\nhouse?\"\n\n\"I do!\"\n\nTim blinked, looked around the room a bit wildly and then settled on\nMartha, looking at her helplessly.\n\n\"It's true, Tim,\" she said quietly. \"It's crazy but it works. I've been\nliving with it for years.\"\n\nTim considered that for a full minute. \"All right,\" he said shortly. \"So\nit works. But why does any kid have to live for himself?\" He eyed James.\n\"Who's responsible for you?\"\n\n\"I am!\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Got an hour?\" asked James with a smile. \"Then listen--\"\n\nAt the end of James Holden's long explanation, Tim Fisher said, \"Me--?\nNow, I need a drink!\"\n\nJames chuckled, \"Alcoholic, of course--which is Pi to seven decimal\nplaces if you ever need it. Just count the letters.\"\n\nOver his glass, Tim eyed James thoughtfully. \"So if this is true, James,\njust who owns that fabulous machine of yours?\"\n\n\"It is mine, or ours.\"\n\n\"You gave me to believe that it was a high-priority Government project,\"\nhe said accusingly.\n\n\"Sorry. But I would lie as glibly to God Himself if it became necessary\nto protect myself by falsehood. I'm sorry it isn't a Government project,\nbut it's just as important a secret.\"\n\n\"Anything as big as this _should_ be the business of the Government.\"\n\n\"Perhaps so. But it's mine to keep or to give, and it's mine to study.\"\nJames was thoughtful for a moment. \"I suppose that you can argue that\nanything as important as this should be handed over to the authorities\nimmediately; that a large group of men dedicated to such a study can\nlocate its difficulties and its pitfalls and failures far swifter than\na single youth of eleven. Yet by the right of invention, a process\nprotected by the Constitution of the United States and circumvented by\nsome very odd rulings on the part of the Supreme Court, it is mine by\ninheritance, to reap the exclusive rewards for my family's work. Until\nI'm of an age when I am deemed capable of managing my own life, I'd be\n'protected' out of my rights if I handed this to anybody--including the\nGovernment. They'd start a commission full of bureaucrats who'd first\nuse the machine to study how to best expand their own little empire,\nperpetuate themselves in office, and then they'd rule me out on the\nquaint theory that education is so important that it mustn't be wasted\non the young.\"\n\nTim Fisher smiled wryly. He turned to Janet Bagley. \"How do you want it?\"\nhe asked her.\n\n\"For Martha's sake, I want it his way,\" she said.\n\n\"All right. Then that's the way we'll have it,\" said Tim Fisher. He eyed\nJames somewhat ruefully. \"You know, it's a funny thing. I've always\nthought this was a screwy set-up, and to be honest, I've always thought\nyou were a pretty bumptious kid. I guess you had a good reason. Anyway, I\nshould have known Janet wouldn't have played along with it unless she had\na reason that was really helping somebody.\"\n\nJames saw with relief that Tim had allied himself with the cause; he was,\nin fact, very glad to have someone knowledgeable and levelheaded in on\nthe problem. Anyway he really liked Tim, and was happy to have the\ndeception out of the way.\n\n\"That's all right,\" he said awkwardly.\n\nTim laughed. \"Hey, will this contraption of yours teach me how to adjust\na set of tappets?\"\n\n\"No,\" said James quickly. \"It will teach you the theory of how to chop\ndown a tree but it can't show you how to swing an axe. Or,\" he went on\nwith a smile, \"it will teach you how to be an efficient accountant--but\nyou have to use your own money!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the house on Martin's Hill, everybody won. Tim Fisher objected at\nfirst to the idea of gallivanting off on a protracted honeymoon, leaving\na nine-year-old daughter in the care of a ten-year-old boy. But\nJanet--now Mrs. Fisher--pointed out that James and Martha were both quite\ncompetent, and furthermore there was little to be said for a honeymoon\nencumbered with a little pitcher that had such big ears, to say nothing\nof a pair of extremely curious eyes and a rather loud voice. And\nfurthermore, if we allow the woman's privilege of adding one furthermore\non top of another, it had been a long, long time since Janet had enjoyed\na child-free vacation. So she won. It was not Hawaii by air for a ten-day\nstay. It was Hawaii by ship with a sixty-day sojourn in a hotel that\noffered both seclusion and company to the guests' immediate preference.\n\nJames Holden won more time. He felt that every hour was a victory. At\ntimes he despaired because time passed so crawlingly slow. All the wealth\nof his education could not diminish that odd sense of the time-factor\nthat convinces all people that the length of the years diminish as age\nincreases. Far from being a simple, amusing remark, the problem has been\nstudied because it is universal. It is psychological, of course, and it\nis not hard to explain simply in terms of human experience plus the known\nfact that the human senses respond to the logarithm of the stimulus.\n\nWith most people, time is reasonably important. We live by the clock, and\nwe die by the clock, and before there were clocks there were candles\nmarked in lengths and sand flowing through narrow orifices, water\ndripping into jars, and posts stuck in the ground with marks for the\nshadow to divide the day. The ancient ones related womanhood to the moon\nand understood that time was vital in the course of Life.\n\nWith James, time was more important, perhaps, than to any other human\nbeing alive. He was fighting for time, always. His was not the immature\ndesire of uneducated youth to become adult overnight for vague reasons.\n\nWith James it was an honest evaluation of his precarious position. He\nhad to hide until he was deemed capable of handling his own affairs,\nafter which he could fight his own battles in his own way without the\ninterference of the laws that are set up to protect the immature.\n\nWith Tim Fisher and his brand-new bride out of the way, James took a deep\nbreath at having leaped one more hurdle. Then he sat down to think.\n\nObviously there is no great sea-change that takes place at the Stroke Of\nMidnight on the date of the person's 21st birthday; no magic wand is\nwaved over his scalp to convert him in a moment of time from a puling\ninfant to a mature adult. The growth of child to adult is as gradual as\nthe increase of his stature, which varies from one child to the next.\n\nThe fact remained that few people are confronted by the necessity of\nmaking a decision based upon the precise age of the subject. We usually\ncross this barrier with no trouble, taking on our rights and\nresponsibilities as we find them necessary to our life. Only in probating\nan estate left by the demise of both parents in the presence of minor\nchildren does this legal matter of precise age become noticeable. Even\nthen, the control exerted over the minor by the legal guardian diminishes\nby some obscure mathematical proportion that approaches zero as the minor\napproaches the legal age of maturity. Rare is the case of the reluctant\nguardian who jealously relinquishes the iron rule only after the proper\nlitigation directs him to let go, render the accounting for audit, and\nturn over the keys to the treasury to the rightful heir.\n\nJames Holden was the seldom case. James Holden needed a very adroit\nlawyer to tell him how and when his rights and privileges as a citizen\ncould be granted, and under what circumstances. From the evidence already\nat hand, James saw loopholes available in the matter of the legal age of\ntwenty-one. But he also knew that he could not approach a lawyer with\nquestions without giving full explanation of every why and wherefore.\n\nSo James Holden, already quite competent in the do-it-himself method of\ncutting his own ice, decided to study law. Without any forewarning of the\nmonumental proportions of the task he faced, James started to acquire\nbooks on legal procedure and the law.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith the return of Tim and Janet Fisher matters progressed well. Mrs.\nFisher took over the running of the household; Tim continued his running\nof the garage and started to dicker for the purchase of the house on\nMartin's Hill. The \"Hermit\" who had returned before the wedding remained\ntemporarily. With a long-drawn plan, Charles Maxwell would slowly fade\nout of sight. Already his absence during the summer was hinting as being\na medical study; during the winter he would return to the distant\nhospital. Later he would leave completely cured to take up residence\nelsewhere. Beyond this they planned to play it by ear.\n\nJames and Martha, freed from the housework routine, went deep into study.\n\nChristmas passed and spring came and in April, James marked his eleventh\nbirthday.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\n\n\nOne important item continued to elude James Holden. The Educator could\nnot be made to work in \"tandem.\" In less technical terms, the Educator\nwas strictly an individual device, a one-man-dog. The wave forms that\ncould be recorded were as individual as fingerprints and pore-patterns\nand iris markings. James could record a series of ideas or a few pages of\ninformation and play them back to himself. During the playback he could\nthink in no other terms; he could not even correct, edit or improve the\nphrasing. It came back word for word with the faithful reproduction of\nabsolute fidelity. Similarly, Martha could record a phase of information\nand she, too, underwent the same repetition when her recording was played\nback to her.\n\nBut if Martha's recording were played through to James, utter confusion\ncame. It was a whirling maze of colors and odors, sound, taste and touch.\n\nIt spoiled some of James Holden's hopes; he sought the way to mass-use,\nhis plan was to employ a teacher to digest the information and then via\nthe Educator, impress the information upon many other brains each coupled\nto the machine. This would not work.\n\nHe made an extra headset late in June and they tried it, sitting\nside-by-side and still it did not work. With Martha doing the reading,\nshe got the full benefit of the machine and James emerged with a whirling\nhead full of riotous colors and other sensations. At one point he hoped\nthat they might learn some subject by sitting side-by-side and reading\nthe text in unison, but from this they received the information horribly\nmingled with equal intensity of sensory noise.\n\nHe did not abandon this hope completely. He merely put it aside as a\nproblem that he was not ready to study yet. He would re-open the question\nwhen he knew more about the whole process. To know the whole process\nmeant studying many fields of knowledge and combining them into a\nresearch of his own.\n\nAnd so James entered the summer months as he'd entered them before; Tim\nand Janet Fisher took off one day and returned the next afternoon with a\ngreat gay show of \"bringing the children home for the summer.\"\n\nEven in this day of multi-billion-dollar budgets and farm surpluses that\ncost forty thousand dollars per hour for warehouse rental, twenty-five\nhundred dollars is still a tidy sum to dangle before the eyes of any\nindividual. This was the reward offered by Paul Brennan for any\ninformation as to the whereabouts of James Quincy Holden.\n\nIf Paul Brennan could have been honest, the information he could have\nsupplied would have provided any of the better agencies with enough\nlead-material to track James Holden down in a time short enough to make\nthe reward money worth the effort. Similarly, if James Holden's\ncompetence had been no greater than Brennan's scaled-down description,\nhe could not have made his own way without being discovered.\n\nBound by his own guilt, Brennan could only fret. Everything including\ntime, was running against him.\n\nAnd as the years of James Holden's independence looked toward the sixth,\nPaul Brennan was willing to make a mental bet that the young man's\neducation was deeper than ever.\n\nHe would have won. James was close to his dream of making his play for an\nappearance in court and pleading for the law to recognize his competence\nto act as an adult. He abandoned all pretense; he no longer hid through\nthe winter months, and he did not keep Martha under cover either. They\nwent shopping with Mrs. Fisher now and then, and if any of the folks in\nShipmont wondered about them, the fact that the children were in the care\nand keeping of responsible adults and were oh-so-quick on the uptake\nstopped anybody who might have made a fast call to the truant officer.\n\nThen in the spring of James Holden's twelfth year and the sixth of\nhis freedom, he said to Tim Fisher. \"How would you like to collect\ntwenty-five hundred dollars?\"\n\nFisher grinned. \"Who do you want killed?\"\n\n\"Seriously.\"\n\n\"Who wouldn't?\"\n\n\"All right, drop the word to Paul Brennan and collect the reward.\"\n\n\"Can you protect yourself?\"\n\n\"I can quote Gladstone from one end to the other. I can cite every civil\nsuit regarding the majority or minority problem that has any importance.\nIf I fail, I'll skin out of there in a hurry on the next train. But I\ncan't wait forever.\"\n\n\"What's the gimmick, James?\"\n\n\"First, I am sick and tired of running and hiding, and I think I've got\nenough to prove my point and establish my rights. Second, there is a bit\nof cupidity here; the reward money is being offered out of my own\ninheritance so I feel that I should have some say in where it should go.\nThird, the fact that I steer it into the hands of someone I'd prefer to\nget it tickles my sense of humor. The trapper trapped; the bopper bopped;\nthe sapper hoist by his own petard.\"\n\n\"And--?\"\n\n\"It isn't fair to Martha, either. So the sooner we get this whole affair\nsettled, the sooner we can start to move towards a reasonable way of\nlife.\"\n\n\"Okay, but how are we going to work it? I can't very well turn up by\nmyself, you know.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"People would think I'm a heel.\"\n\n\"Let them think so. They'll change their opinion once the whole truth is\nknown.\" James smiled. \"It'll also let you know who your true friends\nare.\"\n\n\"Okay. Twenty-five hundred bucks and a chance at the last laugh sounds\ngood. I'll talk it over with Janet.\"\n\nThat night they buried Charles Maxwell, the Hermit of Martin's Hill.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK THREE:\n\nTHE REBEL\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN\n\n\nIn his years of searching, Paul Brennan had followed eleven fruitless\nleads. It had cost him over thirteen hundred dollars and he was prepared\nto go on and on until he located James Holden, no matter how much it\ntook. He fretted under two fears, one that James had indeed suffered a\nmishap, and the other that James might reveal his secret in a dramatic\nannouncement, or be discovered by some force or agency that would place\nthe whole process in hands that Paul Brennan could not reach.\n\nThe registered letter from Tim Fisher culminated this six years of\nfrantic search. Unlike the previous leads, this spoke with authority,\nnamed names, gave dates, and outlined sketchily but adequately the\noperations of the young man in very plausible prose. Then the letter went\non in the manner of a man with his foot in a cleft stick; the writer did\nnot approve of James Holden's operations since they involved his wife and\nnewly-adopted daughter, but since wife and daughter were fond of James\nHolden, the writer could not make any overt move to rid his household of\nthe interfering young man. Paul Brennan was asked to move with caution\nand in utter secrecy, even to sending the reward in cash to a special\npost-office box.\n\nPaul Brennan's reaction was a disappointment to himself. He neither felt\ngreat relief nor the desire to exult. He found himself assaying his own\ncalmness and wondering why he lacked emotion over this culmination of so\nmany years of futile effort. He re-read the letter carefully to see if\nthere were something hidden in the words that his subconscious had\ncaught, but he found nothing that gave him any reason to believe that\nthis letter was a false lead. It rang true; Brennan could understand Tim\nFisher's stated reaction and the man's desire to collect. Brennan even\nsuspected that Fisher might use the reward money for his own private\npurpose.\n\nIt was not until he read the letter for the third time that he saw the\nsuggestion to move with caution and secrecy not as its stated request to\nprotect the writer, but as an excellent advice for his own guidance.\n\nAnd then Paul Brennan realized that for six years he had been\nconcentrating upon the single problem of having James Holden returned to\nhis custody, and in that concentration he had lost sight of the more\nimportant problem of achieving his true purpose of gaining control of the\nHolden Educator. The letter had not been the end of a long quest, but\njust the signal to start.\n\nPaul Brennan of course did not give a fig for the Holden Estate nor the\nwelfare of James. His only interest was in the machine, and the secret of\nthat machine was locked in the young man's mind and would stay that way\nunless James could be coerced into revealing it. The secret indubitably\nexisted as hardware in the machine rebuilt in the house on Martin's Hill,\nbut Brennan guessed that any sight of him would cause James to repeat his\njob of destruction. Brennan also envisioned a self-destructive device\nthat would addle the heart of the machine at the touch of a button,\nperhaps booby-traps fitted like burglar alarms that would ruin the\nmachine at the first touch of an untrained hand.\n\nBrennan's mind began to work. He must plan his moves carefully to acquire\nthe machine by stealth. He toyed with the idea of murder and rejected it\nas too dangerous to chance a repeat, especially in view of the existence\nof the rebuilt machine.\n\nBrennan read the letter again. It gave him to think. James had obviously\nsucceeded in keeping his secret by imparting it to a few people that he\ncould either trust or bind to him, perhaps with the offer of education\nvia the machine, which James and only James maintained in hiding could\nprovide. Brennan could not estimate the extent of James Holden's\nknowledge but it was obvious that he was capable of some extremely\nintelligent planning. He was willing to grant the boy the likelihood of\nbeing the equal of a long and experienced campaigner, and the fact that\nJames was in the favor of Tim Fisher's wife and daughter meant that the\nlad would be able to call upon them for additional advice. Brennan\ncounted the daughter Martha in this planning program, most certainly\nJames would have given the girl an extensive education, too. Everything\nadded up, even to Tim Fisher's resentment.\n\nBut there was not time to ponder over the efficiency of James Holden's\noperations. It was time for Paul Brennan to cope, and it seemed sensible\nto face the fact that Paul Brennan alone could not plot the illegal\ngrab of the Holden Educator and at the same time masquerade as the\ndeeply-concerned loving guardian. He could label James Holden's little\ngroup as an organization, and if he was to combat this organization he\nneeded one himself.\n\nPaul Brennan began to form a mental outline of his requirements. First he\nhad to figure out the angle at which to make his attack. Once he knew the\nlegal angle, then he could find ruthless men in the proper position of\nauthority whose ambitions he could control. He regretted that the elder\nHolden had not allowed him to study civil and criminal law along with his\ncourses in real estate and corporate law. As it was, Brennan was unsure\nof his legal rights, and he could not plan until he had researched the\nproblem most thoroughly.\n\nTo his complete surprise, Paul Brennan discovered that there was no law\nthat would stay an infant from picking up his marbles and leaving home.\nSo long as the minor did not become a ward of responsibility of the\nState, his freedom was as inviolable as the freedom of any adult. The\nuniversal interest in missing-persons cases is overdrawn because of their\ndramatic appeal. In every case that comes to important notice, the\nmissing person has left some important responsibilities that had to be\nsatisfied. A person with no moral, legal, or ethical anchor has every\nright to pack his suitcase and catch the next conveyance for parts\nunknown. If he is found by the authorities after an appeal by friends or\nrelatives, the missing party can tell the police that, Yes he did leave\nhome and, No he isn't returning and, furthermore he does not wish his\nwhereabouts made known; and all the authorities can report is that the\nmissing one is hale, happy, and hearty and wants to stay missing.\n\nUnder the law, a minor is a minor and there is no proposition that\ndivides one degree of minority from another. Major decisions, such as\nvoting, the signing of binding contracts of importance, the determination\nof a course of drastic medical treatment, are deemed to be matters that\nrequire mature judgment. The age for such decisions is arbitrarily set at\nage twenty-one. Acts such as driving a car, sawing a plank, or buying\nfood and clothing are considered to be \"skills\" that do not require\njudgment and therefore the age of demarcation varies with the state and\nthe state legislature's attitude.\n\nJames was a minor; presumably he could repudiate contracts signed while a\nminor, at the time he reached the age of twenty-one. From a practical\nstandpoint, however, anything that James contracted for was expendable\nand of vital necessity. He could not stop payment on a check for his\nrent, nor claim that he had not received proper payment for his stories\nand demand damages. Paul Brennan might possibly interfere with the smooth\noperation by squawking to the bank that Charles Maxwell was a phantom\nfront for the minor child James Holden. And bankers, being bankers, might\nvery well clog up the operation with a lot of questions. But there was\nthe possibility that James Holden, operating through the agency of an\nadult, would switch his method. He could even go so far as to bring\nBrennan to lawsuit to have Brennan stopped from his interference. Child\nor not, James Holden had been running a checking account by mail for a\nnumber of years which could be used as evidence of his good faith and\nability.\n\nIndeed, the position of James Holden was so solid that Brennan could only\nplead personal interest and personal responsibility in the case for\nsecuring a writ of habeas corpus to have the person of James Holden\nreturned to his custody and protection. And this of itself was a bit on\nthe dangerous side. A writ of habeas corpus will, by law, cause the\ndelivery of the person to the right hands, but there is no part of the\nwrit that can be used to guarantee that the person will remain\nthereafter. If Brennan tried to repeat this program, James Holden was\nvery apt to suggest either the rather rare case of Barratry or\nMaintenance against Brennan. Barratry consists of the constant harassment\nof a citizen by the serial entry of lawsuit after lawsuit against him,\neach of which he must defend to the loss of time and money--and the tying\nup of courts and their officials. Maintenance is the re-opening of the\nsame suit and its charges time after time in court after court. One need\nonly be sure of the attitude of the plaintiff to strike back; if he is\ninterested in heckling the defendant and this can be demonstrated in\nevidence, the heckler is a dead duck. Such a response would surely damage\nPaul Brennan's overt position as a responsible, interested, affectionate\nguardian of his best friends' orphaned child.\n\nThen to put the top on the bottle, James Holden had crossed state lines\nin his flight from home. This meant that the case was not the simple\nproposition of appearing before a local magistrate and filing an\nemotional appeal. It was interstate. It smacked of extradition, and James\nHolden had committed no crime in either state.\n\nTo Paul Brennan's qualifications for his henchmen, he now added the need\nfor flouting the law if the law could not be warped to fit his need.\n\nFinding a man with ambition, with a casual disregard for ethics, is not\nhard in political circles. Paul Brennan found his man in Frank Manison,\na rising figure in the office of the District Attorney. Manison had\ngubernatorial ambitions, and he was politically sharp. He personally\nconducted only those cases that would give him ironclad publicity; he\npreferred to lower the boom on a lighter charge than chance an acquittal.\nManison also had a fine feeling for anticipating public trends, a sense\nof the drama, and an understanding of public opinion.\n\nHe granted Brennan a conference of ten minutes, and knowing from long\nexperience that incoming information flows faster when it is not\ninterrupted, he listened attentively, oiling and urging the flow by\nfacial expressions of interest and by leaning forward attentively\nwhenever a serious point was about to come forth. Brennan explained about\nJames Holden, his superior education, and what it had enabled the lad to\ndo. He explained the education not as a machine but as a \"system of\nstudy\" devised by James Holden's parents, feeling that it was better to\nleave a few stones lying flat and unturned for his own protection.\nManison nodded at the end of the ten-minute time-limit, used his desk\ninterphone to inform his secretary that he was not to be disturbed until\nfurther notice (which also told Paul Brennan that he was indeed\ninterested) and then said:\n\n\"You know you haven't a legal leg to stand on, Brennan.\"\n\n\"So I find out. It seems incredible that there isn't any law set up to\ncontrol the activity of a child.\"\n\n\"Incredible? No, Brennan, not so. To now it hasn't been necessary. People\njust do not see the necessity of laws passed to prevent something that\nisn't being done anyway. The number of outmoded laws, ridiculous laws,\nand laws passed in the heat of public emotion are always a subject for\npublic ridicule. If the state legislature were to pass a law stating that\nany child under fourteen may not leave home without the consent of his\nparents, every opposition newspaper in the state would howl about the\nwaste of time and money spent on ridiculous legislation passed to govern\nactivities that are already under excellent control. They would poll the\nstate and point out that for so many million children under age fourteen,\nprecisely zero of them have left home to set up their own housekeeping.\nOne might just as well waste the taxpayer's money by passing a law that\nconfirms the Universal Law of Gravity.\n\n\"But that's neither here nor there,\" he said. \"Your problem is to figure\nout some means of exerting the proper control over this intelligent\ninfant.\"\n\n\"My problem rises higher than that,\" said Brennan ruefully. \"He dislikes\nme to the point of blind, unreasonable hatred. He believes that I am the\nparty responsible for the death of his parents and furthermore that the\nact was deliberate. Tantamount to a charge of first-degree murder.\"\n\n\"Has he made that statement recently?\" asked Manison.\n\n\"I would hardly know.\"\n\n\"When last did you hear him say words to that effect?\"\n\n\"At the time, following the accidental death of his parents, James Holden\nran off to the home of his grandparents. Puzzled and concerned, they\ncalled me as the child's guardian. I went there to bring him back to his\nhome. I arrived the following morning and it was during that session that\nJames Holden made the accusation.\"\n\n\"And he has not made it since, to the best of your knowledge?\"\n\n\"Not that I know of.\"\n\n\"Hardly make anything out of that. Seven years ago. Not a formal charge,\nonly a cry of rage, frustration, hysterical grief. The complaint of a\nfive-year-old made under strain could hardly be considered slanderous.\nIt is too bad that the child hasn't broken any laws. Your success in\ncollecting him the first time was entirely due to the associations he'd\nmade with this automobile thief--Caslow, you said his name was. We can't\ngo back to that. The responsibility has been fixed, I presume, upon Jake\nCaslow in another state. Brennan, you've a real problem: How can you be\nsure that this James Holden will disclose his secret system of study even\nif we do succeed in cooking up some legal means of placing him and keep\nhim in your custody?\"\n\nBrennan considered, and came to the conclusion that now was the time to\nlet another snibbet of information go. \"The system of study consists of\nan electronic device, the exact nature of which I do not understand. The\nentire machine is large and cumbersome. In it, as a sort of 'heart,' is a\nspecial circuit. Without this special circuit the thing is no more than\nan expensive aggregation of delicate devices that could be used elsewhere\nin electronics. One such machine stands unused in the Holden Home because\nthe central circuit was destroyed beyond repair or replacement by young\nJames Holden. He destroyed it because he felt that this secret should\nremain his own, the intellectual inheritance from his parents. There is\none other machine--undoubtedly in full function and employed daily--in\nthe house on Martin's Hill under James Holden's personal supervision.\"\n\n\"Indeed? How, may I ask?\"\n\n\"It was rebuilt by James Holden from plans, specifications, and\ninformation engraved on his brain by his parents through the use of their\nfirst machine. Unfortunately, I have every reason to believe that this\nnew machine is so booby-trapped and tamper-protected that the first\ninterference by someone other than James Holden will cause its\ndestruction.\"\n\n\"Um. It might be possible to impound this machine as a device of high\ninterest to the State,\" mused Manison. \"But if we start any proceeding\nas delicate as that, it will hit every newspaper in the country and our\nadvantage will be lost.\"\n\n\"Technically,\" said Paul Brennan, \"you don't know that such a machine\nexists. But as soon as young Holden realizes that you know about his\nmachine, he'll also know that you got the information from me.\" Brennan\nsat quietly and thought for a moment. \"There's another distressing angle,\ntoo,\" he said at last. \"I don't think that there is a soul on earth who\nknows how to run this machine but James Holden. Steal it or impound it or\ntake it away legally, you've got to know how it runs. I doubt that we'd\nfind a half-dozen people on the earth who'd willingly sit in a chair with\na heavy headset on, connected to a devilish aggregation of electrical\nmachinery purported to educate the victim, while a number of fumblers\nexperimented with the dials and the knobs and the switches. No sir, some\nsort of pressure must be brought to bear upon the youngster.\"\n\n\"Um. Perhaps civic pride? Might work. Point out to him that he is in\ncontrol of a device that is essential to the security of the United\nStates. That he is denying the children of this country the right to\ntheir extensive education. Et cetera?\"\n\n\"Could be. But how are you going to swing it, technically in ignorance of\nthe existence of such a machine?\"\n\n\"Were I a member of the Congressional Committee on Education, I could\ninvestigate the matter of James Holden's apparent superiority of\nintellect.\"\n\n\"And hit Page One of every newspaper in the country,\" sneered Brennan.\n\n\"Well, I'm not,\" snapped Manison angrily. \"However, there is a way,\nperhaps several ways, once we find the first entering wedge. After all,\nBrennan, the existence of a method of accelerating the course of\neducational training is of the utmost importance to the future of not\nonly the United States of America, but the entire human race. Once I can\nlocate some plausible reason for asking James Holden the first question\nabout anything, the remainder of any session can be so slanted as to\nbring into the open any secret knowledge he may have. We, to make the\ndisclosure easier, shall hold any sessions in the strictest of secrecy.\nWe can quite readily agree with James Holden's concern over the\nlong-range effectiveness of his machine and state that secrecy is\nnecessary lest headstrong factions take the plunge into something that\ncould be very detrimental to the human race instead of beneficial.\nFrankly, Mr. Brennan,\" said Manison with a wry smile, \"I should like to\nborrow that device for about a week myself. It might help me locate some\nof the little legal points that would help me.\" He sighed. \"Yes,\" he said\nsadly, \"I know the law, but no one man knows all of the finer points.\nLord knows,\" he went on, \"if the law were a simple matter of behaving as\nit states, we'd not have this tremendous burden. But the law is subject\nto interpretation and change and argument and precedent--Precedent? Um,\nhere we may have an interesting angle, Brennan. I must look into it.\"\n\n\"Precedent?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed. Any ruling that we were to make covering the right of a\nseven, eight, or nine year old to run his own life as he sees fit will be\na ruling that establishes precedent.\"\n\n\"And--?\"\n\n\"Well, up to now there's no ruling about such a case; no child of ten has\never left home to live as he prefers. But this James Holden is apparently\ncapable of doing just that--and any impartial judge deliberating such a\ncase would find it difficult to justify a decision that placed the\ncompetent infant under the guardianship and protection of an adult who is\nless competent than the infant.\"\n\nBrennan's face turned dark. \"You're saying that this Holden kid is\nsmarter than I am?\"\n\n\"Sit down and stop sputtering,\" snapped Manison. \"What were you doing at\nsix years old, Brennan? Did you have the brains to leave home and protect\nyourself by cooking up the plausible front of a very interesting\ncharacter such as the mythical Hermit of Martin's Hill? Were you writing\nboys' stories for a nationwide magazine of high circulation and\naccredited quality? Could you have planned your own dinner and prepared\nit, or would you have dined on chocolate bars washed down with strawberry\npop? Stop acting indignant. Start thinking. If for no other reason than\nthat we don't want to end up selling pencils on Halstead Street because\nwe're not quite bright, we've got to lay our hands on that machine. We've\ngot to lead, not follow. Yet at the present time I'll wager that your\nJames Holden is going to give everybody concerned a very rough time. Now,\nlet me figure out the angles and pull the wires. One thing that nobody\ncan learn from any electronic machine is how to manipulate the component\npeople that comprise a political machine. I'll be in touch with you,\nBrennan.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe ring at the door was Chief of Police Joseph Colling and another\ngentleman. Janet Fisher answered the door, \"Good evening, Mr. Colling.\nCome in?\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Colling politely. \"This is Mr. Frank Manison, from the\noffice of the State Department of Justice.\"\n\n\"Oh? Is something wrong?\"\n\n\"Not that we know of,\" replied Manison. \"We're simply after some\ninformation. I apologize for calling at eight o'clock in the evening, but\nI wanted to catch you all under one roof. Is Mr. Fisher home? And the\nchildren?\"\n\n\"Why, yes. We're all here.\" Janet stepped aside to let them enter the\nliving room, and then called upstairs. Mr. Manison was introduced around\nand Tim Fisher said, cautiously, \"What's the trouble here?\"\n\n\"No trouble that we know of,\" said Manison affably. \"We're just after\nsome information about the education of James Holden, a legal minor, who\nseems never to have been enrolled in any school.\"\n\n\"If you don't mind,\" replied Tim Fisher, \"I'll not answer anything\nwithout the advice of my attorney.\"\n\nJanet Fisher gasped.\n\nTim turned with a smile. \"Don't you like lawyers, honey?\"\n\n\"It isn't that. But isn't crying for a lawyer an admission of some sort?\"\n\n\"Sure is,\" replied Tim Fisher. \"It's an admission that I don't know all\nof my legal rights. If lawyers come to me because they don't know all\nthere is to know about the guts of an automobile, I have every right to\nthe same sort of consultation in reverse. Agree, James?\"\n\nJames Holden nodded. \"The man who represents himself in court has a fool\nfor a client,\" he said. \"I think that's Daniel Webster, but I'm not\ncertain. No matter; it's right. Call Mr. Waterman, and until he arrives\nwe'll discuss the weather, the latest dope in high-altitude research, or\nnuclear physics.\"\n\nFrank Manison eyed the lad. \"You're James Holden?\"\n\n\"I am.\"\n\nTim interrupted. \"We're not answering _anything_,\" he warned.\n\n\"Oh, I don't mind admitting my identity,\" said James. \"I've committed no\ncrime, I've broken no law. No one can point to a single act of mine that\nshows a shred of evidence to the effect that my intentions are not\nhonorable. Sooner or later this whole affair had to come to a showdown,\nand I'm prepared to face it squarely.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Manison. \"Now, without inviting comment, let me explain\none important fact. The state reserves the right to record marriages,\nbirths, and deaths as a simple matter of vital statistics. We feel that\nwe have every right to the compiling of the census, and we can justify\nour feeling. I am here because of some apparent irregularities, records\nof which we do not have. If these apparent irregularities can be\nexplained to our satisfaction for the record, this meeting will be ended.\nNow, let's relax until your attorney arrives.\"\n\n\"May I get you some coffee or a highball?\" asked Janet Fisher.\n\n\"Coffee, please,\" agreed Frank Manison. Chief Colling nodded quietly.\nThey relaxed over coffee and small talk for a half hour. The arrival of\nWaterman, Tim Fisher's attorney, signalled the opening of the discussion.\n\n\"First,\" said Manison, his pencil poised over a notebook, \"Who lives here\nin permanent residence, and for how long?\" He wrote rapidly as they told\nhim. \"The house is your property?\" he asked Tim, and wrote again. \"And\nyou are paying a rental on certain rooms of this house?\" he asked James,\nwho nodded.\n\n\"Where did you attend school?\" he asked James.\n\n\"I did not.\"\n\n\"Where did you get your education?\"\n\n\"By a special course in home study.\"\n\n\"You understand that under the state laws that provide for the education\nof minor children, the curriculum must be approved by the state?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"And has it?\"\n\nWaterman interrupted. \"Just a moment, Mr. Manison. In what way must the\ncurriculum be approved? Does the State study all textbooks and the manner\nin which each and every school presents them? Or does the State merely\ninsist that the school child be taught certain subjects?\"\n\n\"The State merely insists that certain standards of education be\nobserved.\"\n\n\"In fact,\" added James, \"the State does not even insist that the child\n_learn_ the subjects, realizing that some children lack the intellect to\nbe taught certain subjects completely and fully. Let's rather say that\nthe State demands that school children be exposed to certain subjects in\nthe hope that they 'take.' Am I not correct?\"\n\n\"I presume you are.\"\n\n\"Then I shall answer your question. In my home study, I have indeed\nfollowed the approved curriculum by making use of the approved textbooks\nin their proper order. I am aware of the fact that this is not the same\nState, but if you will consult the record of my earlier years in\nattendance at a school selected by my legal guardian, you'll find that I\npassed from preschool grade to Fourth Grade in a matter of less than half\na year, at the age of five-approaching-six. If this matter is subject to\nquestion, I'll submit to any course of extensive examination your\neducators care to prepare. The law regarding compulsory education in this\nstate says that the minor child must attend school until either the age\nof eighteen, or until he has completed the standard eight years of\ngrammar school and four years of high school. I shall then stipulate that\nthe suggested examination be limited to the schooling of a high school\ngraduate.\"\n\n\"For the moment we'll pass this over. We may ask that you do prove your\ncontention,\" said Manison.\n\n\"You don't doubt that I can, do you?\" asked James.\n\nManison shook his head. \"No, at this moment I have no doubt.\"\n\n\"Then why do you bother asking?\"\n\n\"I am here for a rather odd reason,\" said Manison. \"I've told you the\nreservations that the State holds, which justify my presence. Now, it is\npatently obvious that you are a very competent young man, James Holden.\nThe matter of making your own way is difficult, as many adults can\ntestify. To have contrived a means of covering up your youth, in addition\nto living a full and competent life, demonstrates an ability above and\nbeyond the average. Now, the State is naturally interested in anything\nthat smacks of acceleration of the educational period. Can you understand\nthat?\"\n\n\"Naturally. None but a dolt would avoid education.\"\n\n\"Then you agree with our interest?\"\n\n\"I--\"\n\n\"Just a moment, James,\" said Waterman. \"Let's put it that you understand\ntheir interest, but that you do not necessarily agree.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said James.\n\n\"Then you must also understand that this 'course of study' by which you\nclaim the equal of a high-school education at the age of ten or eleven\n(perhaps earlier) must be of high importance.\"\n\n\"I understand that it might,\" agreed James.\n\n\"Then will you explain why you have kept this a secret?\"\n\n\"Because--\"\n\n\"Just a moment,\" said Waterman again. \"James, would you say that your\nmethod of educating yourself is completely perfected?\"\n\n\"Not completely.\"\n\n\"Not perfected?\" asked Manison. \"Yet you claim to have the education of a\nhigh-school graduate?\"\n\n\"I so claim,\" said James. \"But I must also point out that I have acquired\na lot of mish-mash in the course of this education. For instance, it is\none thing to study English, its composition, spelling, vocabulary,\nconstruction, rules and regulations. One must learn these things if he is\nto be considered literate. In the course of such study, one also becomes\nacquainted with English literature. With literature it is enough to\nmerely be acquainted with the subject. One need not know the works of\nChaucer or Spenser intimately--unless one is preparing to specialize in\nthe English literature of the writers of that era. Frankly, sir, I should\nhate to have my speech colored by the flowery phrases of that time, and\nthe spelling of that day would flunk me out of First Grade if I made use\nof it. In simple words, I am still perfecting the method.\"\n\n\"Now, James,\" went on Waterman, \"have you ever entertained the idea of\nnot releasing the details of your method?\"\n\n\"Occasionally,\" admitted James.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Until we know everything about it, we can not be certain that its\nultimate effect will be wholly beneficial.\"\n\n\"So, you see,\" said Waterman to Manison, \"the intention is reasonable.\nFurthermore, we must point out that this system is indeed the invention\ncreated by the labor and study of the parents of James Holden, and as\nsuch it is a valuable property retained by James Holden as his own by the\nright of inheritance. The patent laws of the United States are clear, it\nis the many conflicting rulings that have weakened the system. The law\nitself is contained in the Constitution of the United States, which\nprovides for the establishment of a Patent Office as a means to encourage\ninventors by granting them the exclusive right to the benefits of their\nlabor for a reasonable period of time--namely seventeen years with\nprovision for a second period under renewal.\"\n\n\"Then why doesn't he make use of it?\" demanded Manison.\n\n\"Because the process, like so many another process, can be copied and\nused by individuals without payment, and because there hasn't been a\npatent suit upheld for about forty years, with the possible exception\nof Major Armstrong's suit against the Radio Corporation of America,\nsettled in Armstrong's favor after about twenty-five years of expensive\nlitigation. A secret is no longer a secret these days, once it has been\nwritten on a piece of paper and called to the attention of a few million\npeople across the country.\"\n\n\"You realize that anything that will give an extensive education at an\nearly age is vital to the security of the country.\"\n\n\"We recognize that responsibility, sir,\" said Waterman quietly. \"We also\nrecognize that in the hands of unscrupulous men, the system could be\nmisused. We also realize its dangers, and we are trying to avoid them\nbefore we make the announcement. We are very much aware of the important,\nalthough unfortunate, fact that James Holden, as a minor, can have his\nrights abridged. Normally honest men, interested in the protection of\nyouth, could easily prevent him from using his own methods, thus\ndepriving him of the benefits that are legally his. This could be\ndone under the guise of protection, and the result would be the\nsuper-education of the protectors--whose improving intellectual\ncompetence would only teach them more and better reasons for depriving\nthe young man of his rights. James Holden has a secret, and he has a\nright to keep that secret, and his only protection is for him to continue\nto keep that secret inviolate. It was his parents' determination not to\nrelease this process upon the world until they were certain of the\nresults. James is a living example of their effort; they conceived him\nfor the express purpose of providing a virgin mind to educate by their\nmethods, so that no outside interference would becloud their results. If\nthis can be construed as the illegal experimentation on animals under the\nanti-vivisection laws, or cruelty to children, it was their act, not his.\nIs that clear?\"\n\n\"It is clear,\" replied Manison. \"We may be back for more discussion on\nthis point. I'm really after information, not conducting a case, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"Well, you have your information.\"\n\n\"Not entirely. We've another point to consider, Mr. Waterman. It is\nadmittedly a delicate point. It is the matter of legal precedent.\nGranting everything you say is true--and I'll grant that hypothetically\nfor the purpose of this argument--let's assume that James Holden\nultimately finds his process suitable for public use. Now, happily to\nthis date James had not broken any laws. He is an honorable individual.\nLet's now suppose that in the near future, someone becomes educated by\nhis process and at the age of twelve or so decided to make use of his\nadvanced intelligence in nefarious work?\"\n\n\"All right. Let's suppose.\"\n\n\"Then you tell me who is responsible for the person of James Holden?\"\n\n\"He is responsible unto himself.\"\n\n\"Not under the existing laws,\" said Manison. \"Let's consider James just\nas we know him now. Who says, 'go ahead,' if he has an attack of acute\nappendicitis?\"\n\n\"In the absence of someone to take the personal responsibility,\" said\nJames quietly, \"the attending doctor would toss his coin to see whether\nhis Oath of Hippocrates was stronger than his fear of legal reprisals.\nIt's been done before. But let's get to the point, Mr. Manison. What do\nyou have in mind?\"\n\n\"You've rather pointedly demonstrated your preference to live here rather\nthan with your legally-appointed guardian.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, young man, I suggest that we get this matter settled legally. You\nare not living under the supervision of your guardian, but you are indeed\nliving under the auspices of people who are not recognized by law as\nholding the responsibility for you.\"\n\n\"So far there's been no cause for complaint.\"\n\n\"Let's keep it that way,\" smiled Manison. \"I'll ask you to accept a writ\nof habeas corpus, directing you to show just cause why you should not be\nreturned to the custody of your guardian.\"\n\n\"And what good will that do?\"\n\n\"If you can show just cause,\" said Manison, \"the Court will follow\nestablished precedent and appoint Mr. and Mrs. Fisher as your responsible\nlegal guardians--if that is your desire.\"\n\n\"Can this be done?\" asked Mrs. Fisher.\n\n\"It's been done before, time and again. The State is concerned primarily\nwith the welfare of the child; children have been legally removed from\nnatural but unsuitable parents, you know.\" He looked distressed for a\nmoment and then went on, \"The will of the deceased is respected, but the\nlaw recognizes that it is the living with which it must be primarily\nconcerned, that mistakes can be made, and that such errors in judgment\nmust be rectified in the name of the public weal.\"\n\n\"I've been--\" started James but Attorney Waterman interrupted him:\n\n\"We'll accept the service of your writ, Mr. Manison.\" And to James after\nthe man had departed: \"Never give the opposition an inkling of what you\nhave in mind--and always treat anybody who is not in your retainer as\nopposition.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\n\n\nThe case of Brennan vs. Holden opened in the emptied court room of Judge\nNorman L. Carter, with a couple of bored members of the press wishing\nthey were elsewhere. For the first two hours, it was no more than\nformalized outlining of the whole situation.\n\nThe plaintiff identified himself, testified that he was indeed the legal\nguardian of the minor James Quincy Holden, entered a transcript of the\nwill in evidence, and then went on to make his case. He had provided\na home atmosphere that was, to the best of his knowledge, the type of\nhome atmosphere that would have been highly pleasing to the deceased\nparents--especially in view of the fact that this home was one and the\nsame house as theirs and that little had been changed. He was supported\nby the Mitchells. It all went off in the slow, cumbersome dry phraseology\nof the legal profession and the sum and substance of two hours of\nback-and-forth question-and-answer was to establish the fact that Paul\nBrennan had provided a suitable home for the minor, James Quincy Holden,\nand that the minor James Quincy Holden had refused to live in it and had\nindeed demonstrated his objections by repeatedly absenting himself\nwilfully and with premeditation.\n\nThe next half hour covered a blow-by-blow account of Paul Brennan's\nefforts to have the minor restored to him. The attorneys for both sides\nwere alert. Brennan's counsel did not even object when Waterman paved the\nway to show why James Holden wanted his freedom by asking Brennan:\n\n\"Were you aware that James Holden was a child of exceptional intellect?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And you've testified that when you moved into the Holden home, you found\nthings as the Holdens had provided them for their child?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"In your opinion, were these surroundings suitable for James Holden?\"\n\n\"They were far too advanced for a child of five.\"\n\n\"I asked specifically about James Holden.\"\n\n\"James Holden was five years old.\"\n\nWaterman eyed Brennan with some surprise, then cast a glance at Frank\nManison, who sat at ease, calmly watching and listening with no sign of\nobjection. Waterman turned back to Brennan and said, \"Let's take one more\nturn around Robin Hood's Barn, Mr. Brennan. First, James Holden was an\nexceptional child?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And the nature of his toys and furnishings?\"\n\n\"In my opinion, too advanced for a child of five.\"\n\n\"But were they suitable for James Holden?\"\n\n\"James Holden was a child of five.\"\n\nWaterman faced Judge Carter. \"Your Honor,\" he said, \"I submit that the\nwitness is evasive. Will you direct him to respond to my direct question\nwith a direct answer?\"\n\n\"The witness will answer the question properly,\" said Judge Carter with\na slight frown of puzzlement, \"unless counsel for the witness has some\nplausible objection?\"'\n\n\"No objection,\" said Manison.\n\n\"Please repeat or rephrase your question,\" suggested Judge Carter.\n\n\"Mr. Brennan,\" said Waterman, \"you've testified that James was an\nexceptional child, advanced beyond his years. You've testified that the\nhome and surroundings provided by James Holden's parents reflected this\nfact. Now tell me, were the toys, surroundings, and the home suitable for\nJames Holden?\"\n\n\"In my opinion, no.\"\n\n\"And subsequently you replaced them with stuff you believed more suitable\nfor a child of five, is that it?\"\n\n\"Yes. I did, and you are correct.\"\n\n\"To which he objected?\"\n\n\"To which James Holden objected.\"\n\n\"And what was your response to his objection?\"\n\n\"I overruled his objection.\"\n\n\"Upon what grounds?\"\n\n\"Upon the grounds that the education and the experience of an adult\ncarries more wisdom than the desires of a child.\"\n\n\"Now, Mr. Brennan, please listen carefully. During the months following\nyour guardianship, you successively removed the books that James Holden\nwas fond of reading, replaced his advanced Meccano set with a set of\nmodular blocks, exchanged his oil-painting equipment for a child's\ncoloring books and standard crayolas, and in general you removed\neverything interesting to a child with known superiority of intellect?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"And your purpose in opening this hearing was to convince this Court that\nJames Holden should be returned by legal procedure to such surroundings?\"\n\n\"It is.\"\n\n\"No more questions,\" said Waterman. He sat down and rubbed his forehead\nwith the palm of his right hand, trying to think.\n\nManison said, \"I have one question to ask of Janet Fisher, known formerly\nas Mrs. Bagley.\"\n\nJanet Fisher was sworn and properly identified.\n\n\"Now, Mrs. Fisher, prior to your marriage to Mr. Fisher and during your\nsojourn with James Holden in the House on Martin's Hill, did you\nsupervise the activities of James Holden?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Manison. He turned to Waterman and waved him to any\ncross-questioning.\n\nStill puzzled, Waterman asked, \"Mrs. Fisher, who did supervise the House\non Martin's Hill?\"\n\n\"James Holden.\"\n\n\"During those years, Mrs. Fisher, did James Holden at any time conduct\nhimself in any other manner but the actions of an honest citizen? I mean,\ndid he perform or suggest the performance of any illegal act to your\nknowledge?\"\n\n\"No, he did not.\"\n\nWaterman turned to Judge Carter. \"Your Honor,\" he said, \"it seems quite\napparent to me that the plaintiff in this case has given more testimony\nto support the contentions of my client than they have to support their\nown case. Will the Court honor a petition that the case be dismissed?\"\n\nJudge Norman L. Carter smiled slightly. \"This is irregular,\" he said.\n\"You should wait for that petition until the plaintiff's counsel has\nclosed his case, you know.\" He looked at Frank Manison. \"Any objection?\"\n\nManison said, \"Your Honor, I have permitted my client to be shown in this\nquestionable light for no other purpose than to bring out the fact that\nany man can make a mistake in the eyes of other men when in reality he\nwas doing precisely what he thought to be the best thing to do for\nhimself and for the people within his responsibility. The man who raises\nhis child to be a roustabout is wrong in the eyes of his neighbor who is\nraising his child to be a scientist, and vice versa. We'll accept the\nfact that James Holden's mind is superior. We'll point out that there\nhave been many cases of precocious children or child geniuses who make a\nstrong mark in their early years and drop into oblivion by the time\nthey're twenty. Now, consider James Holden, sitting there discussing\nsomething with his attorney--I have no doubt in the world that he could\nconjugate Latin verbs, discuss the effect of the Fall of Rome on Western\nCivilization, and probably compute the orbit of an artificial satellite.\nBut can James Holden fly a kite or shoot a marble? Has he ever had the\nfun of sliding into third base, or whittling on a peg, or any of the\nother enjoyable trivia of boyhood? Has he--\"\n\n\"One moment,\" said Judge Carter. \"Let's not have an impassioned oration,\ncounsel. What is your point?\"\n\n\"James Holden has a legal guardian, appointed by law at the express will\nof his parents. Headstrong, he has seen fit to leave that protection. He\nis fighting now to remain away from that protection. I can presume that\nJames Holden would prefer to remain in the company of the Fishers where,\naccording to Mrs. Fisher, he was not responsible to her whatsoever, but\nrather ran the show himself. I--\"\n\n\"You can't make that presumption,\" said Judge Carter. \"Strike it from the\nrecord.\"\n\n\"I apologize,\" said Manison. \"But I object to dismissing this case until\nwe find out just what James Holden has in mind for his future.\"\n\n\"I'll hold Counsel Waterman's petition in abeyance until the point you\nmention is in the record,\" said Judge Carter. \"Counsel, are you\nfinished?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Manison. \"I'll rest.\"\n\n\"Mr. Waterman?\"\n\nWaterman said, \"Your Honor, we've been directed to show just cause why\nJames Holden should not be returned to the protection of his legal\nguardian. Counsel has implied that James Holden desires to be placed in\nthe legal custody of Mr. and Mrs. Fisher. This is a pardonable error\nwhether it stands in the record or not. The fact is that James Holden\ndoes not need protection, nor does he want protection. To the contrary,\nJames Holden petitions this Court to declare him legally competent so\nthat he may conduct his own affairs with the rights, privileges, and\nindeed, even the _risks_ taken by the status of adult.\n\n\"I'll point out that the rules and laws that govern the control and\nprotection of minor children were passed by benevolent legislators to\nprevent exploitation, cruelty, and deprivation of the child's life by\nmen who would take advantage of his immaturity. However we have here a\nyoung man of twelve who has shown his competence to deal with the adult\nworld by actual practice. Therefore it is our contention that protective\nlaws are not only unnecessary, but undesirable because they restrict the\nindividual from his desire to live a full and fruitful life.\n\n\"To prove our contention beyond any doubt, I'll ask that James Holden be\nsworn in as my first witness.\"\n\nFrank Manison said, \"I object, Your Honor. James Holden is a minor and\nnot qualified under law to give creditable testimony as a witness.\"\n\nWaterman turned upon Manison angrily. \"You really mean that you object to\nmy case _per se_.\"\n\n\"That, too,\" replied Manison easily.\n\n\"Your Honor, I take exception! It is my purpose to place James Holden on\nthe witness stand, and there to show this Court and all the world that he\nis of honorable mind, properly prepared to assume the rights of an adult.\nWe not only propose to show that he acted honorably, we shall show that\nJames Holden consulted the law to be sure that whatever he did was not\nillegal.\"\n\n\"Or,\" added Manison, \"was it so that he would know how close to the limit\nhe could go without stepping over the line?\"\n\n\"Your Honor,\" asked Waterman, \"can't we have your indulgence?\"\n\n\"I object! The child is a minor.\"\n\n\"I accept the statement!\" stormed Waterman. \"And I say that we intend to\nprove that this minor is qualified to act as an adult.\"\n\n\"And,\" sneered Manison, \"I'll guess that one of your later arguments will\nbe that Judge Carter, having accepted this minor as qualified to deliver\nsworn testimony, has already granted the first premise of your argument.\"\n\n\"I say that James Holden has indeed shown his competence already by\nactually doing it!\"\n\n\"While hiding under a false fa\u00e7ade!\"\n\n\"A fa\u00e7ade forced upon him by the restrictive laws that he is petitioning\nthe Court to set aside in his case so that he need hide no longer.\"\n\nFrank Manison said, \"Your Honor, how shall the case of James Holden be\ndetermined for the next eight or ten years if we do grant James Holden\nthis legal right to conduct his own affairs as an adult? That we must\nabridge the laws regarding compulsory education is evident. James Holden\nis twelve years and five months old. Shall he be granted the right to\nenter a tavern to buy a drink? Will his request for a license to marry be\nhonored? May he enter the polling place and cast his vote? The contention\nof counsel that the creation of Charles Maxwell was a physical necessity\nis acceptable. But what happens without 'Maxwell'? Must we prepare a card\nof identity for James Holden, stating his legal status, and renew it\nevery year like an automobile license because the youth will grow in\nstature, add to his weight, and ultimately grow a beard? Must we enter on\nthis identification card the fact that he is legally competent to sign\ncontracts, rent a house, write checks, and make his own decision about\nthe course of dangerous medical treatment--or shall we list those items\nthat he is not permitted to do such as drinking in a public place, cast\nhis vote, or marry? This State permits a youth to drive an automobile at\nthe age of sixteen, this act being considered a skill rather than an act\nthat requires judgment. Shall James Holden be permitted to drive an\nautomobile even though he can not reach the foot pedals from any position\nwhere he can see through the windshield?\"\n\nJudge Carter sat quietly. He said calmly, \"Let the record show that I\nrecognize the irregularity of this procedure and that I permit it only\nbecause of the unique aspects of this case. Were there a Jury, I would\ndismiss them until this verbal exchange of views and personalities has\nsubsided.\n\n\"Now,\" he went on, \"I will not allow James Holden to take the witness\nstand as a qualified witness to prove that he is a qualified witness.\nI am sure that he can display his own competence with a flow of academic\nbrilliance, or his attorney would not have tried to place him upon the\nstand where such a display could have been demonstrated. Of more\nimportance to the Court and to the State is an equitable disposition\nof the responsibility to and over James Quincy Holden.\"\n\nJudge Norman L. Carter leaned forward and looked from Frank Manison to\nJames Holden, and then to Attorney Waterman.\n\n\"We must face some awkward facts,\" he said. \"If I rule that he be\nreturned to Mr. Brennan, he will probably remain no longer than he finds\nit convenient, at which point he will behave just as if this Court had\nnever convened. Am I not correct, Mr. Manison?\"\n\n\"Your Honor, you are correct. However, as a member of the Department of\nJustice of this State, I suggest that you place the responsibility in my\nhands. As an Officer of the Court, my interest would be to the best\ninterest of the State rather than based upon experience, choice, or\nopinion as to what is better for a five-year-old or a child prodigy. In\nother words, I would exert the control that the young man needed. At the\nsame time I would not make the mistakes that were made by Mr. Brennan's\npersonal opinion of how a child should be reared.\"\n\nWaterman shouted, \"I object, Your Honor. I object--\"\n\nBrennan leaped to his feet and cried, \"Manison, you can't freeze me\nout--\"\n\nJames Holden shrilled, \"I won't! I won't!\"\n\nJudge Carter eyed them one by one, staring them into silence. Finally he\nlooked at Janet Fisher and said, \"May I also presume that you would be\nhappy to resume your association with James Holden?\"\n\nShe nodded and said, \"I'd be glad to,\" in a sincere voice. Tim Fisher\nnodded his agreement.\n\nBrennan whirled upon them and snarled. \"My reward money--\" but he was\nshoved down in his seat with a heavy hand by Frank Manison who snapped,\n\"Your money bought what it was offered for. So now shut up, you utter\nimbecile!\"\n\nJudge Norman L. Carter cleared his throat and said, \"This great concern\nover the welfare of James Holden is touching. We have Mr. Brennan already\ntwice a loser and yet willing to try it for three times. We have Mr. and\nMrs. Fisher who are not dismayed at the possibility of having their home\noccupied by a headstrong youth whose actions they cannot control. We find\none of the ambitious members of the District Attorney's Office offering\nto take on an additional responsibility--all, of course, in the name of\nthe State and the welfare of James Holden. Finally we have James Holden\nwho wants no part of the word 'protection' and claims the ability to run\nhis own life.\n\n\"Now it strikes me that assigning the responsibility for this young\nman's welfare is by no means the reason why you all are present, and it\nsimilarly occurs to me that the young man's welfare is of considerably\nless importance than the very interesting question of how and why this\nyoung man has achieved so much.\"\n\nWith a thoughtful expression, Judge Carter said, \"James Holden, how did\nyou acquire this magnificent education at the tender age of twelve-plus?\"\n\n\"I--\"\n\n\"I object!\" cried Frank Manison. \"The minor is not qualified to give\ntestimony.\"\n\n\"Objection overruled. This is not testimony. I have every right in the\nworld to seek out as much information from whatever source I may select;\nand I have the additional right to inspect the information I receive to\npass upon its competence and relevance. Sit down, counsel!\"\n\nManison sat grumpily and Judge Carter eyed James again, and James took a\nfull breath. This was the moment he had been waiting for.\n\n\"Go on, James. Answer my question. Where did you come by your knowledge?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJames Holden stood up. This was the question that had to arise; he was\nonly surprised it had taken so long.\n\nHe said calmly: \"Your Honor, you may not ask that question.\"\n\n\"I may not?\" asked Judge Carter with a lift of his eyebrows.\n\n\"No sir. You may not.\"\n\n\"And just why may I not?\"\n\n\"If this were a criminal case, and if you could establish that some of my\nknowledge were guilty knowledge, you could then demand that I reveal the\nsource of my guilty knowledge and under what circumstance it was\nobtained. If I refused to disclose my source, I could then be held in\ncontempt of court or charged with being an accessory to the corpus of the\ncrime. However, this is a court hearing to establish whether or not I am\ncompetent under law to manage my own affairs. How I achieve my mental\ncompetence is not under question. Let us say that it is a process that is\nmy secret by the right of inheritance from my parents and as such it is\nvaluable to me so long as I can demand payment for its use.\"\n\n\"This information may have a bearing on my ruling.\"\n\n\"Your Honor, the acquisition of knowledge or information _per se_ is\nconcomitant with growing up. I can and will demonstrate that I have the\nequivalent of the schooling necessary to satisfy both this Court and the\nState Board of Education. I will state that my education has been\nacquired by concentration and application in home study, and that I admit\nto attendance at no school. I will provide you or anybody else with a\nlist of the books from which I have gleaned my education. But whether I\npractice Yoga, Dianetics, or write the lines on a sugarcoated pill and\nswallow it is my trade secret. It can not be extracted from me by any\nprocess of the law because no illegality exists.\"\n\n\"And what if I rule that you are not competent under the law, or withhold\njudgment until I have had an opportunity to investigate these ways and\nmeans of acquiring an accelerated education?\"\n\n\"I'll then go on record as asking you to disbar yourself from this\nhearing on the grounds that you are not an impartial judge of the justice\nin my case.\"\n\n\"Upon what grounds?\"\n\n\"Upon the grounds that you are personally interested in being provided\nwith a process whereby you may acquire an advanced education yourself.\"\n\nThe judge looked at James thoughtfully for a moment. \"And if I point out\nthat any such process is of extreme interest to the State and to the\nUnion itself, and as such must be disclosed?\"\n\n\"Then I shall point out that your ruling is based upon a personal opinion\nbecause you don't know anything about the process. If I am ruled a legal\nminor you cannot punish me for not telling you my secrets, and if I am\nruled legally competent, I am entitled to my own decision.\"\n\n\"You are within your rights,\" admitted Judge Carter with some interest.\n\"I shall not make such a demand. But I now ask you if this process of\nyours is both safe and simple.\"\n\n\"If it is properly used with some good judgment.\"\n\n\"Now listen to me carefully,\" said Judge Carter. \"Is it not true that\nyour difficulties in school, your inability to get along with your\nclassmates, and your having to hide while you toiled for your livelihood\nin secret--these are due to this extensive education brought about\nthrough your secret process?\"\n\n\"I must agree, but--\"\n\n\"You must agree,\" interrupted Judge Carter. \"Yet knowing these unpleasant\nthings did not deter you from placing, or trying to place, the daughter\nof your housekeeper in the same unhappy state. In other words, you hoped\nto make an intellectual misfit out of her, too?\"\n\n\"I--now see here--\"\n\n\"You see here! Did you or did you not aid in the education of Martha\nBagley, now Martha Fisher?\"\n\n\"Yes, I did, and--\"\n\n\"Was that good judgment, James Holden?\"\n\n\"What's wrong with higher education?\" demanded James angrily.\n\n\"Nothing, if it's acquired properly.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Now listen again. If I were to rule in your favor, would Martha Fisher\nbe the next bratling in a long and everlasting line of infant supermen\napplying to this and that and the other Court to have their legal\nmajority ruled, each of them pointing to your case as having established\nprecedence?\"\n\n\"I have no way of predicting the future, sir. What may happen in the\nfuture really has no bearing in evidence here.\"\n\n\"Granted that it does not. But I am not going to establish a dangerous\nprecedent that will end with doctors qualified to practice surgery before\nthey are big enough to swing a stethoscope or attorneys that plead a case\nbefore they are out of short pants. I am going to recess this case\nindefinitely with a partial ruling. First, until this process of yours\ncomes under official study, I am declaring you, James Holden, to be a\nWard of this State, under the jurisdiction of this Court. You will have\nthe legal competence to act in matters of skill, including the signing of\ndocuments and instruments necessary to your continued good health. In all\nmatters that require mature judgment, you will report to this Court and\nall such questions shall be rendered after proper deliberation either in\nopen session or in chambers, depending upon the Court's opinion of their\nimportance. The court stenographer will now strike all of the testimony\ngiven by James Holden from the record.\"\n\n\"I object!\" exploded Brennan's attorney, rising swiftly and with one hand\npressing Brennan down to prevent him from rising also.\n\n\"All objections are overruled. The new Ward of the State will meet with\nme in my chambers at once. Court is adjourned.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe session was stormy but brief. Holden objected to everything, but the\nvoice of Judge Carter was loud and his stature was large; they overrode\nJames Holden and compelled his attention.\n\n\"We're out of the court,\" snapped Judge Carter. \"We no longer need\nobserve the niceties of court etiquette, so now shut up and listen!\nHolden, you are involved in a thing that is explosively dangerous. You\nclaim it to be a secret, but your secret is slowly leaking out of your\ncontrol. You asked for your legal competence to be ruled. Fine, but if I\nallowed that, every statement made by you about your education would be\nin court record and your so-called secret that much more widespread. How\nlong do you think it would have been before millions of people howled at\nyour door? Some of them yelping for help and some of them bitterly\nobjecting to tampering with the immature brain? You'd be accused of\nbrainwashing, of making monsters, of depriving children of their heritage\nof happiness--and in the same ungodly howl there would be voices as\nloudly damning you for not tossing your process into their laps. And\nthere would be a number trying to get to you on the sly so that they\ncould get a head start over the rest.\n\n\"You want your competence affirmed legally? James, you have not the\nstature nor the voice to fight them off. Even now, your little secret is\nin danger and you'll probably have to bribe a few wiseacres with a touch\nof accelerated knowledge to keep them from spilling the whole story, even\nthough I've ruled your testimony incompetent and immaterial and stricken\nfrom the record. Now, we'll study this system of yours under controlled\nconditions as your parents wanted, and we'll have professional help and\neducated advice, and both you and your process shall be under the\nprotection of my Court, and when the time comes you shall receive the\nkudos and benefits from it. Understand?\"\n\n\"Yes sir.\"\n\n\"Good. Now, as my first order, you go back to Shipmont and pack your\ngear. You'll report to my home as soon as you've made all the\narrangements. There'll be no more hiding out and playing your little\nprocess in secret either from Paul Brennan--yes, I know that you believe\nthat he was somehow instrumental in the death of your parents but have no\nshred of evidence that would stand in court--or the rest of the world. Is\nthat, and everything else I've said in private, very clear?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Good. Now, be off with you. And do not hesitate to call upon me if there\nis any interference whatsoever.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN\n\n\nJudge Carter insisted and won his point that James Holden accept\nresidence in his home.\n\nHe did not turn a hair when the trucks of equipment arrived from the\nhouse on Martin's Hill; he already had room for it in the cellar. He\ncheerfully allowed James the right to set it up and test it out. He\nrespected James Holden's absolute insistence that no one be permitted to\ntouch the special circuit that was the heart of the entire machine. Judge\nCarter also counter-requested--and enforced the request--that he be\nallowed to try the machinery out. He took a simple reading course in\nhigher mathematics, after discovering that Holden's machine would not\nteach him how to play the violin. (Judge Carter already played the\nviolin--but badly.)\n\nLater, the judge committed to memory the entire book of Bartlett's Famous\nQuotations despite the objection of young Holden that he was cluttering\nup his memory with a lot of useless material. The Judge learned (as James\nhad learned earlier) that the proper way to store such information in the\nmemory was to read the book with the machine turned in \"stand-by\" until\nsome section was encountered that was of interest. Using this method, the\njudge picked and pecked at the Holy Bible, a number of documents that\nlooked like important governmental records, and a few books in modern\nhistory.\n\nThen there came other men. First was a Professor Harold White from the\nState Board of Education who came to study both Holden and Holden's\nmachinery and what it did. Next came a Dr. Persons who said very little\nbut made diagrams and histograms and graphs which he studied. The third\nwas a rather cheerful fellow called Jack Cowling who was more interested\nin James Holden's personal feelings than he was in the machine. He\nstudied many subjects superficially and watched the behavior of young\nHolden as Holden himself studied subjects recommended by Professor White.\n\nWhite had a huge blackboard installed on the cellar wall opposite the\nmachine, and he proceeded to fill the board with block outlines filled\nwith crabbed writing and odd-looking symbols. The whole was meaningless\nto James Holden; it looked like the organization chart of a large\ncorporation but it contained no names or titles. The arrival of each new\nvisitor caused changes in the block diagram.\n\nThese arrivals went at their project with stop watches and slide rules.\nThey calibrated themselves and James with the cold-blooded attitude of\nracetrack touts clocking their favorite horses. Where James had simply\ntaken what he wanted or what he could at any single sitting, then let\nit settle in his mind before taking another dose of unpremeditated\nmagnitude, these fellows ascertained the best effectiveness of each\napplication to each of them. They tried taking long terms under the\nmachine and then they measured the time it took for the installed\ninformation to sink in and settle into usable shape. Then they tried\nshorter and shorter sittings and measured the correspondingly shorter\nsettling times. They found out that no two men were alike, nor were any\ntwo subjects. They discovered that a man with an extensive education\nalready could take a larger sitting and have the new information\navailable for mental use in a shorter settling time than a man whose\neducation had been sketchy or incomplete.\n\nThey brought in men who had either little or no mathematics and gave them\ncourses in advanced subjects. Afterwards they provided the foundation\nmathematics and they calibrated and measured the time it took for the\nhigher subject to be understood as it aligned its information to the\nwhole. Men came with crude English and bluntly read the dictionary and\nthe proper rules of grammar and they were checked to see if their early\nbad-speech habits were corrected, and to what degree the Holden machine\ncould be made to help repair the damage of a lifelong ingrained set of\nerrors. They sent some of these boys through comparison dictionaries in\nforeign tongues and then had their language checked by specialists who\nwere truly polylingual. There were some who spoke fluent English but no\nother tongue; these progressed into German with a German-to-English\ncomparison dictionary, and then into French via a German-to-French\ncomparison and were finally checked out in French by French-speaking\nexaminers.\n\nAnd Professor White's block diagram grew complex, and Dr. Persons's\nhistograms filled pages and pages of his broad notebooks.\n\nIt was the first time that James Holden had ever seen a team of\nresearchers plow into a problem, running a cold and icy scientific\ninvestigation to ascertain precisely how much cause produced how much\neffect. Holden, who had taken what he wanted or needed as the time came,\nbegan to understand the desirability of full and careful programming. The\nwhole affair intrigued him and interested him. He plunged in with a will\nand gave them all the help he could.\n\nHe had no time to be bored, and he did not mark the passage of time until\nhe arrived at his thirteenth birthday.\n\nThen one night shortly after his birthday, James Holden discovered women\nindirectly. He had his first erotic dream.\n\nWe shall not go into the details of this midnight introduction to the\narrival of manhood, for the simple reason that if we dwell on the\nsubject, someone is certain to attempt a dream-analysis and come up with\nsome flanged-up character-study or personality-quirk that really has\nnothing to do with the mind or body of James Holden. The truth is that\nhis erotic dream was pleasantly stirring, but not entirely satisfactory.\nIt was fun while it lasted, but it didn't last very long. It awakened him\nto the realization that knowledge is not the end-all of life, and that a\nfull understanding of the words, the medical terms, and the biology\ninvolved did not tell him a thing about this primary drive of all life.\n\nHis total grasp of even the sideline issues was still dim. He came to a\npartial understanding of why Jake Caslow had entertained late visitors of\nthe opposite sex, but he still could not quite see the reason why Jake\nkept the collection of calendar photographs and paintings hung up around\nthe place. Crude jokes and rude talk heard long years before and dimly\nremembered did not have much connection with the subject. To James\nHolden, a \"tomato\" was still a vegetable, although he knew that some\nbotanists were willing to argue that the tomato was really a fruit.\n\nFor many days he watched Judge Carter and his wife with a critical\ncuriosity that their childless life had never known before. James found\nthat they did not act as if something new and strangely thrilling had\njust hit the known universe. He felt that they should know about it.\nDespite the fact that he knew everything that his textbooks could tell\nhim about sex and copulation he still had the quaint notion that the\nreason why Judge Carter and his wife were childless was because they had\nnot yet gotten around to Doing It. He made no attempt to correlate this\noddity with its opposite in Jake Caslow's ladies of the night who seemed\nto go on their merry way without conceiving.\n\nHe remembered the joking parry-and-thrust of that midnight talk between\nTim Fisher and Janet Bagley but it made no sense to him still. But as he\npondered the multitude of puzzlements, some of the answers fell partly\ninto place just as some of the matching pieces of a jigsaw puzzle may lie\nclose to one another when they are dumped out of the box. Very dimly\nJames began to realize that this sort of thing was not New, but to the\ncontrary it had been going on for a long, long time. So long in fact that\nneither Tim Fisher nor Janet Bagley had found it necessary to state\ndesire and raise objection respectively in simple clear sentences\ncontaining subject, verb, and object. This much came to him and it\nbothered him even more, now that he understood that they were bandying\ntheir meanings lightly over a subject so vital, so important, so--so\ncompletely personal.\n\nThen, in that oddly irrational corner of his brain that neither knowledge\nnor information had been adequate to rationalize nor had experience\narrived to supply the explanation, James Holden's limited but growing\ncomprehension arrived at a conclusion that was reasonable within its\nlimited framework. Judge Carter and his wife occupied separate bedrooms\nand had therefore never Done It. Conversely, Tim and Janet Fisher from\ntheir midnight discussion obviously Knew What It Was All About. James\nwondered whether they had Done It yet, and he also wondered whether he\ncould tell by listening to their discussions and conversations now that\nthey'd been married at least long enough to have Tried It.\n\nWith a brand new and very interesting subject to study, James lost\ninterest in the program of concentrated research. James Holden found that\nall he had to do to arrange a trip to Shipmont was to state his desire to\ngo and the length of his visit. The judge deemed both reasonable, Mrs.\nCarter packed James a bag, and off he went.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe house on Martin's Hill was about the same, with some improvement such\nas a coat of paint and some needed repair work. The grounds had been\nworked over, but it was going to take a number of years of concentrated\ngardening to de-weed the tangled lawn and to cut the undergrowth in the\nthin woodsy back area where James had played in concealment.\n\nBut the air inside was changed. Janet, as Mrs. Bagley, had been as close\nto James Holden as any substitute mother could have been. Now she seemed\npreoccupied and too busy with her own life to act more than pleasantly\npolite. He could have been visiting the home of a friend instead of\nreturning to the domicile he had created, in which he had provided her\nwith a home--for herself and a frightened little girl. She asked him how\nhe had been and what he was doing, but he felt that this was more a\nmatter of taking up time than real interest. He had the feeling that\nsomewhere deep inside, her soul was biting its fingernails. She spoke of\nMartha with pride and hope, she asked how Judge Carter was making out and\nwhether Martha would be able to finish her schooling via Holden's\nmachine.\n\nJames believed this was her problem. Martha had been educated far beyond\nher years. She could no more enter school now than he could; unwittingly\nhe'd made Martha a misfit, too. So James tried to explain that part of\nthe study undertaken in Judge Carter's program had been the question of\nwhat to do about Martha.\n\nThe professionals studying the case did not know yet whether Martha would\nremain ahead of her age group, or whether to let her loaf it out until\nher age group caught up with her, or whether to give Martha everything\nshe could take as fast as she could take it. This would make a female\ncounterpart of James Holden to study.\n\nBut knowing that there were a number of very brilliant scientists,\neducators, and psychologists working on Martha's problem did not cheer up\nMrs. Janet Fisher as much as James thought it should. Yet as he watched\nher, he could not say that Tim Fisher's wife was _unhappy_.\n\nTim, on the other hand, looked fine. James watched them together as\ncritically curious as he'd been in watching the Judge and Mrs. Carter.\nTim was gentle with his wife, tender, polite, and more than willing to\nwait on her. From their talk and chit-chat, James could detect nothing.\nThere were still elisions, questions answered with a half-phrase,\ncomments added with a disconnected word and replied in another word\nthat--in cold print--would appear to have no bearing on the original\nsubject. This sort of thing told James nothing. Judge Carter and his wife\ndid the same; if there were any difference to be noted it was only in the\nbasic subject materials. The judge and his wife were inclined more toward\ndiscussions of political questions and judicial problems, whereas Tim and\nJanet Fisher were more interested in music, movies, and the general trend\nof the automobile repair business; or more to the point, whether to\nexpand the present facility in Shipmont, to open another branch\nelsewhere, or to sell out to buy a really big operation in some sizable\ncity.\n\nJames saw a change in Martha, too. It had been months since he came back\nhome to supervise the removal of his belongings. Now Martha had filled\nout. She was dressed in a shirt-and-skirt instead of the little jumper\ndresses James remembered. Martha's hair was lightly wavy instead of\ntrimmed short, and she was wearing a very faint touch of color on her\nlips. She wore tiny slippers with heels just a trifle higher than the\naltitude recommended for a girl close to thirteen.\n\nUltimately they fell into animated chatter of their own, just as they\nalways had. There was a barrier between the pair of them and Martha's\nmother and stepfather--slightly higher than the usual barrier erected\nbetween children and their adults because of their educational adventures\ntogether. They had covered reams and volumes together. Martha's mother\nwas interested in Holden's machine only when something specific came to\nher attention that she did not wish to forget such as a recipe or a\npattern, and one very extensive course that enabled her to add a column\nof three-digit numbers by the whole lines instead of taking each column\ndigit by digit. Tim Fisher himself had deeper interests, but nearly all\nof them directed at making Tim Fisher a better manager of the automobile\nrepair business. There had been some discussion of the possibility that\nTim Fisher might memorize some subject such as the names of all baseball\nplayers and their yearly and lifetime scoring, fielding, and playing\naverages, training for him to go as a contestant on one of the big money\ngiveaway shows. This never came to pass; Tim Fisher did not have any\nspectacular qualities about him that would land him an invitation. So\nTim's work with Holden's machine had been straightforward studies in\nmechanics and bookkeeping and business management--plus a fine repertoire\nof bawdy songs he had rung in on the sly and subsequently used at\nparties.\n\nJames and Martha had taken all they wanted of education and available\ninformation, sometimes with plan and the guidance of schoolbooks and\nsometimes simply because they found the subject of interest. In the past\nthey'd had discussions of problems in understanding; they'd talked of\nthings that parents and elders would have considered utterly impossible\nto discuss with young minds. With this communion of interests, they fell\nback into their former pattern of first joining the general conversation\npolitely and then gradually confining their remarks to one another until\nthere were two conversations going on at the same time, one between\nJames and Martha and another between Janet and Tim. Again, the vocal\ninterference and cross-talk became too high, and it was Tim and Janet who\nleft the living room to mix a couple of highballs and start dinner.\n\nThe chatter continued, but now with a growing strain on the part of young\nJames Holden.\n\nHe wanted to switch to a more personal topic of conversation but he did\nnot know how to accomplish this feat. There was plenty of interest but it\nwas more clinical than passionate; he was not stirred to yearning, he\nfelt no overwhelming desire to hold Martha's hand nor to feel the\nsoftness of her face, yet there was a stirring urge to make some form of\ncontact. But he had no idea of how to steer the conversation towards\npersonal lines that might lead into something that would justify a\ngesture towards her. It began to work on him. The original clinical urge\nto touch her just to see what reaction would obtain changed into a\npersonal urge that grew higher as he found that he could not kick the\nconversational ball in that direction. The idea of putting an arm about\nher waist as he had seen men embrace their girls on television was a\npleasing thought; he wanted to find out if kissing was as much fun as it\nwas made up to be.\n\nBut instead of offering him any encouragement, or even giving him a\nchance to start shifting the conversation, Martha went prattling on and\non and on about a book she'd read recently.\n\nIt did not occur to James Holden that Martha Bagley might entertain the\nidea of physical contact of some mild sort on an experimental basis. He\ndid not even consider the possibility that he might _start_ her thinking\nabout it. So instead of closing the distance between them like a gentle\nwolf, watching with sly calculation to ascertain whether her response was\npositive, negative, or completely neutral, he sat like a post and fretted\ninwardly because he couldn't control the direction of their conversation.\n\nUltimately, of course, Martha ran out of comment on her book and then\nthere fell a deadly silence because James couldn't dredge up another\nlively subject. Desperately, he searched through his mind for an opening.\nThere was none. The bright patter between male and female characters in\nbooks he'd smuggled started off on too high a level on both sides. Books\nthat were written adequately for his understanding of this problem signed\noff with the trite explanation that they lived happily ever afterwards\nbut did not say a darned thing about how they went about it. The slightly\nlurid books that he'd bought, delivered in plain wrappers, gave some very\nilluminating descriptions of the art or act, but the affair opened with\nthe scene all set and the principal characters both ready, willing, and\nable. There was no conversational road map that showed the way that led\ntwo people from a calm and unemotional discussion into an area that might\nlead to something entirely else.\n\nIn silence, James Holden sat there sinking deeper and deeper into his own\nmisery.\n\nThe more he thought about it, the farther he found himself from his\ndesire. Later in the process, he knew, came a big barrier called\n\"stealing a kiss,\" and James with his literal mind provided this game\nwith an aggressor, a defender, and the final extraction by coercion or\nviolence of the first osculatory contact. If the objective could be\ncarried off without the defense repulsing the advance, the rest was\nsupposed to come with less trouble. But here he was floundering before he\nbegan, let alone approaching the barrier that must be an even bigger\nproblem.\n\nBriefly he wished that it were Christmas, because at Christmas people\nhung up mistletoe. Mistletoe would not only provide an opening by\ncustom and tradition, it also cut through this verbal morass of trying\nto lead up to the subject by the quick process of supplying the subject\nitself. But it was a long time before Christmas. James abandoned that\nill-conceived idea and went on sinking deep and feeling miserable.\n\nThen Martha's mother took James out of his misery by coming in to\nannounce dinner. Regretfully, James sighed for his lost moments and\nhelplessness, then got to his feet and held out a hand for Martha.\n\nShe put her hand in his and allowed him to lift her to her feet by\npulling. The first contact did not stir him at all, though it was warm\nand pleasant. Once the pulling pressure was off, he continued to hold\nMartha's hand, tentatively and experimentally.\n\nThen Janet Fisher showered shards of ice with a light laugh. \"You two can\nstand there holding hands,\" she said. \"But I'm going to eat it while it's\non the table.\"\n\nJames Holden's hand opened with the swiftness of a reflex action, almost\nas fast as the wink of an eye at the flash of light or the body's jump at\nthe crack of sound. Martha's hand did not drop because she, too, was\nholding his and did not let go abruptly. She giggled, gave his hand a\nlittle squeeze and said, \"Let's go. I'm hungry too.\"\n\nNone of which solved James Holden's problem. But during dinner his\npersonal problem slipped aside because he discovered another slight\nchange in Janet Fisher's attitude. He puzzled over it quietly, but\nmanaged to eat without any apparent preoccupation. Dinner took about a\nhalf hour, after which they spent another fifteen minutes over coffee,\nwith Janet refusing her second cup. She disappeared at the first shuffle\nof a foot under the table, while James and Martha resumed their years-old\nchore of clearing the table and tackling the dishwashing problem.\n\nAlone in the kitchen, James asked Martha, \"What's with your mother?\"\n\n\"What do you mean, what's with her?\"\n\n\"She's changed, somehow.\"\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"She seems sort of inner-thoughtful. Cheerful enough but as if\nsomething's bothering her that she can't stop.\"\n\n\"That all?\"\n\n\"No,\" he went on. \"She hiked upstairs like a shot right after dinner was\nover. Tim raced after her. And she said no to coffee.\"\n\n\"Oh, that. She's just a little upset in the middle.\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\n\"She's pregnant.\"\n\n\"Pregnant?\"\n\n\"Sure. Can't you see?\"\n\n\"Never occurred to me to look.\"\n\n\"Well, it's so,\" said Martha, scouring a coffee cup with an exaggerated\nflourish. \"And I'm going to have a half-sibling.\"\n\n\"But look--\"\n\n\"Don't _you_ go getting upset,\" said Martha. \"It's a natural process\nthat's been going on for hundreds of thousands of years, you know.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"Not for months,\" said Martha. \"It just happened.\"\n\n\"Too bad she's unhappy.\"\n\n\"She's very happy. Both of them wanted it.\"\n\nJames considered this. He had never come across Voltaire's observation\nthat marriage is responsible for the population because it provides the\nmaximum opportunity with the maximum temptation. But it was beginning to\nfilter slowly into his brain that the ways and means were always\navailable and there was neither custom, tradition, nor biology that\ndictated a waiting period or a time limit. It was a matter of choice, and\nwhen two people want their baby, and have no reason for not having their\nbaby, it is silly to wait.\n\n\"Why did they wait so long if they both want it?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" replied Martha in a matter-of-fact voice, \"they've been working at\nit right along.\"\n\nJames thought some more. He'd come to see if he could detect any\ndifference between the behavior of Judge and Mrs. Carter, and the\nbehavior of Tim and Janet Fisher. He saw little, other than the standard\ndifferences that could be accounted for by age and temperament. Tim and\nJanet did not really act as if they'd Discovered Something New. Tim, he\nknew, was a bit more sweet and tender to Janet than he'd been before, but\nthere was nothing startling in his behavior. If there were any difference\nas compared to their original antics, James knew that it was undoubtedly\ndue to the fact that they didn't have to stand lollygagging in the\nhallway for two hours while Janet half-heartedly insisted that Tim go\nhome. He went on to consider his original theory that the Carters were\nchildless because they occupied separate bedrooms; by some sort of\ndeduction he came to the conclusion that he was right, because Tim and\nJanet Fisher were making a baby and they slept in the same bedroom.\n\nHe went on in a whirl; maybe the Carters didn't want children, but it was\nmore likely that they too had tried but it hadn't happened.\n\nAnd then it came to him suddenly that here he was in the kitchen alone\nwith Martha Bagley, discussing the very delicate subject. But he was\nactually no closer to his problem of becoming a participant than he'd\nbeen an hour ago in the living room. It was one thing to daydream the\nsuggestion when you can also daydream the affirmative response, but it\nwas another matter when the response was completely out of your control.\nJames was not old enough in the ways of the world to even consider\noutright asking; even if he had considered it, he did not know how to\nask.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe evening went slowly. Janet and Tim returned about the time the\ndishwashing process was complete. Janet proposed a hand of bridge; Tim\nsuggested poker, James voted for pinochle, and Martha wanted to toss a\ncoin between canasta or gin rummy. They settled it by dealing a shuffled\ndeck face upward until the ace of hearts landed in front of Janet,\nwhereupon they played bridge until about eleven o'clock. It was\ninteresting bridge; James and Martha had studied bridge columns and books\nfor recreation; against them were aligned Tim and Janet, who played with\nthe card sense developed over years of practice. The youngsters knew the\ntheories, their bidding was as precise as bridge bidding could be made\nwith value-numbering, honor-counting, response-value addition, and all\nof the other systems. They understood all of the coups and end plays\ncomplete with classic examples. But having all of the theory engraved on\ntheir brains did not temporarily imprint the location of every card\nalready played, whereas Tim and Janet counted their played cards\nautomatically and made up in play what they missed in stratagem.\n\nAt eleven, Janet announced that she was tired, Tim joined her; James\nturned on the television set and he and Martha watched a ten-year-old\nmovie for an hour. Finally Martha yawned.\n\nAnd James, still floundering, mentally meandered back to his wish that it\nwere Christmas so that mistletoe would provide a traditional gesture of\naffection, and came up with a new and novel idea that he expressed in a\nvoice that almost trembled:\n\n\"Tired, Martha?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh.\"\n\n\"Well, why don't I kiss you good night and send you off to bed.\"\n\n\"All right, if you want to.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Oh--just--well, everybody does it.\"\n\nShe sat near him on the low divan, looking him full in the face but\nmaking no move, no gesture, no change in her expression. He looked at her\nand realized that he was not sure of how to take hold of her, how to\nreach for her, how to proceed.\n\nShe said, \"Well, go ahead.\"\n\n\"I'm going to.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"As soon as I get good and ready.\"\n\n\"Are we going to sit here all night?\"\n\nIn its own way, it reminded James of the equally un-brilliant\nconversation between Janet and Tim on the homecoming after their first\ndate. He chuckled.\n\n\"What's so funny?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" he said in a slightly strained voice. \"I'm thinking that here\nwe sit like a couple of kids that don't know what it's all about.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Martha, \"aren't we?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said reluctantly, \"I guess we are. But darn it, Martha, how\ndoes a guy grow up? How does a guy learn these things?\" His voice was\nplaintive, it galled him to admit that for all of his knowledge and his\ncompetence, he was still just a bit more than a child emotionally.\n\n\"I don't know,\" she said in a voice as plaintive as his. \"I wouldn't know\nwhere to look to find it. I've tried. All I know,\" she said with a\nquickening voice, \"is that somewhere between now and then I'll learn how\nto toss talk back and forth the way they do.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said glumly.\n\n\"James,\" said Martha brightly, \"we should be somewhat better than a pair\nof kids who don't know what it's all about, shouldn't we?\"\n\n\"That's what bothers me,\" he admitted. \"We're neither of us stupid. Lord\nknows we've plenty of education between us, but--\"\n\n\"James, how did we get that education?\"\n\n\"Through my father's machine.\"\n\n\"No, you don't understand. What I mean is that no matter how we got our\neducation, we had to learn, didn't we?\"\n\n\"Why, yes. In a--\"\n\n\"Now, let's not get involved in another philosophical argument. Let's run\nthis one right on through to the end. Why are we sitting here fumbling?\nBecause we haven't yet learned how to behave like adults.\"\n\n\"I suppose so. But it strikes me that anything should be--\"\n\n\"James, for goodness' sake. Here we are, the two people in the whole\nworld who have studied everything we know together, and when we hit\nsomething we can't study--you want to go home and kiss your old machine,\"\nshe finished with a remarkable lack of serial logic. She laughed\nnervously.\n\n\"What's so darned funny?\" he demanded sourly.\n\n\"Oh,\" she said, \"you're afraid to kiss me because you don't know how, and\nI'm afraid to let you because I don't know how, and so we're talking away\na golden opportunity to find out. James,\" she said seriously, \"if you\nfumble a bit, I won't know the difference because I'm no smarter than you\nare.\"\n\nShe leaned forward holding her face up, her lips puckered forward in\na tight little rosebud. She closed her eyes and waited. Gingerly and\nhesitantly he leaned forward and met her lips with a pucker of his own.\nIt was a light contact, warm, and ended quickly with a characteristic\nsmack that seemed to echo through the silent house. It had all of the\nemotional charge of a mother-in-law's peck, but it served its purpose\nadmirably. They both opened their eyes and looked at one another from\nfour inches of distance. Then they tried it again and their second was a\nlittle longer and a little warmer and a little closer, and it ended with\nless of the noise of opening a fruit jar.\n\nMartha moved over close beside him and put her head on his shoulder;\nJames responded by putting an arm around her, and together they tried to\nassemble themselves in the comfortably affectionate position seen in\nmovies and on television. It didn't quite work that way. There seemed to\nbe too many arms and legs and sharp corners for comfort, or when they\nfound a contortion that did not create interferences with limb or corner,\nit was a strain on the spine or a twist in the neck. After a few minutes\nof this coeducational wrestling they decided almost without effort to\nreturn to the original routine of kissing. By more luck than good\nmanagement they succeeded in an embrace that placed no strain and which\nmet them almost face to face. They puckered again and made contact, then\npressure came and spread out the pair of tightly pursed rosebuds. Martha\nmoved once to get her nose free of his cheek for a breath of air.\n\nAt the rate they were going, they might have hit paydirt this time, but\njust at the point where James should have relaxed to enjoy the long kiss\nhe began to worry: There is something planned and final about the quick\nsmacking kiss, but how does one gracefully terminate the long-term,\nhigh-pressure jobs? So instead of enjoying himself, James planned and\ndiscarded plans until he decided that the way he'd do it would be to\nexert a short, heavy pressure and then cease with the same action as in\nthe quick-smack variety.\n\nIt worked fine, but as he opened his eyes to look at her, she was there\nwith her eyes still closed and her lips still ready. He took a deep\nbreath and plunged in again. Having determined how to start, James was\nnow going to experiment with endings.\n\nThey came up for air successfully again, and then spent some time\nwriggling around into another position. The figure-fitting went easier\nthis time, after threshing around through three or four near-comforts\nthey came to rest in a pleasantly natural position and James Holden\nbecame nervously aware of the fact that his right hand was cupped over\na soft roundness that filled his palm almost perfectly. He wondered\nwhether to remove it quickly to let her know that this intimacy wasn't\nintentional; slowly so that (maybe, he hoped) she wouldn't realize that\nit had been there; or to leave it there because it felt pleasant. While\nhe was wondering, Martha moved around because she could not twist her\nneck all the way around like an owl, and she wanted to see him. The move\nsolved his problem but presented the equally great problem of how he\nwould try it again.\n\nJames allowed a small portion of his brain to think about this, and put\nthe rest of his mind at ease by kissing her again. Halfway through, he\nfelt warm moistness as her lips parted slightly, then the tip of her\ntongue darted forward between his lips to quest against his tongue in a\ncaress so fleeting that it was withdrawn before he could react--and James\nreacted by jerking his head back faster than if he had been clubbed in\nthe face. He was still tingling with the shock, a pleasant shock but none\nthe less a shock, when Martha giggled lightly.\n\nHe bubbled and blurted, \"Wha--whu--?\"\n\nShe told him nervously, \"I've been wanting to try that ever since I read\nit in a book.\"\n\nHe shivered. \"What book?\" he demanded in almost a quaver.\n\n\"A paperback of Tim's. Mother calls them, Tim's sex and slay stories.\"\nMartha giggled again. \"You jumped.\"\n\n\"Sure did. I was surprised. Do it again.\"\n\n\"I don't think so.\"\n\n\"Didn't you like it?\"\n\n\"Did you?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I didn't have time to find out.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nHe kissed her again and waited. And waited. And waited. Finally he moved\nback an inch and said, \"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"I don't think we should. Maybe we ought to wait until we're older.\"\n\n\"Not fair,\" he complained. \"You had all the warning.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Didn't you like it?\" he asked.\n\n\"Well, it gave me the most tickly tingle.\"\n\n\"And all I got was a sort of mild electric shock. Come on.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I'll do it to you.\"\n\n\"All right. Just once.\"\n\nLeaping to the end of this midnight research, there are three primary\nways of concluding, namely: 1, physical satisfaction; 2, physical\nexhaustion; and 3, interruption. We need not go into sub-classifications\nor argue the point. James and Martha were not emotionally ready to\nconclude with mutual defloration. Ultimately they fell asleep on the\ndivan with their arms around each other. They weren't interrupted;\nthey awoke as the first flush of daylight brightened the sky, and with\none more rather chaste kiss, they parted to fall into the deep slumber of\ncomplete physical and emotional exhaustion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN\n\n\nJames Holden's ride home on the train gave him a chance to think, alone\nand isolated from all but superficial interruptions. He felt that he was\nquite the bright young man.\n\nHe noticed with surreptitious pride that folks no longer eyed him with\nsly, amused, knowing smiles whenever he opened a newspaper. Perhaps some\nof their amusement had been the sight of a youngster struggling with a\nfull-spread page, employing arms that did not quite make the span. But\nmost of all he hated the condescending tolerance; their everlasting\nattitude that everything he did was \"cute\" like the little girl who\ndecked herself out in mother's clothing from high heels and brassiere\nto evening gown, costume jewelry, and a fumbled smear of makeup.\n\nThat was over. He'd made it to a couple of months over fourteen, he'd\nfinally reached a stature large enough so that he did not have to prove\nhis right to buy a railroad ticket, nor climb on the suitcase bar so that\nhe could peer over the counter. Newsdealers let him alone to pick his own\nfare instead of trying to \"save his money\" by shoving Mickey Mouse at him\nand putting his own choice back on its pile.\n\nHe had not succeeded in gaining his legal freedom, but as Ward of the\nState under Judge Carter he had other interesting expectations that he\nmight not have stumbled upon. Carter had connections; there was talk of\nJames' entering a comprehensive examination at some university, where the\nexamining board, forearmed with the truth about his education, would test\nJames to ascertain his true level of comprehension. He could of course\ncollect his bachelor's degree once he complied with the required work\nof term papers written to demonstrate that his information could be\ninterwoven into the formation of an opinion, or reflection, or view\nof some topic. Master's degrees and doctor's degrees required the\npresentation of some original area of study, competence in his chosen\nfield, and the development of some facet of the field that had not been\ntouched before. These would require more work, but could be handled in\ntime.\n\nIn fact, he felt that he was in pretty good shape. There were a couple\nof sticky problems, still. He wanted Paul Brennan to get his comeuppance,\nbut he knew that there was no evidence available to support his story\nabout the slaughter of his parents. It galled him to realize that\ncold-blooded, premeditated murder for personal profit and avarice could\ngo undetected. But until there could be proffered some material evidence,\nBrennan's word was as good as his in any court. So Brennan was getting\naway with it.\n\nThe other little item was his own independence. He wanted it. That he\nmight continue living with Judge Carter had no bearing. No matter how\nbenevolent the tyranny, James wanted no part of it. In fighting for his\nfreedom, James Holden's foot had slipped. He'd used his father's machine\non Martha, and that was a legal error.\n\nMartha? James was not really sorry he'd slipped. Error or not, he'd made\nof her the only person in the world who understood his problem wholly and\nsympathetically. Otherwise he would be completely alone.\n\nOh yes, he felt that he was quite the bright young man. He was coming\nalong fine and getting somewhere. His very pleasant experiences in the\nhouse on Martin's Hill had raised him from a boy to a young man; he was\nnow able to grasp the appreciation of the Big Drive, to understand some\nof the reasons why adults acted in the way that they did. He hadn't\nmanaged another late session of sofa with Martha, but there had been\nlittle incidental meetings in the hallway or in the kitchen with the\nexchange of kisses, and they'd boldly kissed goodbye at the railroad\nstation under her mother's smile.\n\nHe could not know Janet Fisher's mind, of course. Janet, mother to a girl\nentering young womanhood, worried about all of the things that such a\nmother worries about and added a couple of things that no other mother\never had. She could hardly slip her daughter a smooth version of the\nbirds and the bees and people when she knew full well that Martha had\ngone through a yard or so of books on the subject that covered everything\nfrom the advanced medical to the lurid expos\u00e9 and from the salacious to\nthe ribald. Janet could only hope that her daughter valued her chastity\naccording to convention despite the natural human curiosity which in\nMartha would be multiplied by the girl's advanced education. Janet knew\nthat young people were marrying younger and younger as the years went on;\nshe saw young James Holden no longer as a rather odd youngster with\nabilities beyond his age. She saw him now as the potential mate for\nMartha. And when they embraced and kissed at the station, Janet did not\nrealize that she was accepting this salute as the natural act of two\nsub-adults, rather than a pair of precocious kids.\n\nAt any rate, James Holden felt very good. Now he had a girl. He had\nacquired one more of the many attitudes of the Age of Maturity.\n\nSo James settled down to read his newspaper, and on page three he saw a\nphotograph and an article that attracted his attention. The photograph\nwas of a girl no more than seven years old holding a baby at least a year\nold. Beside them was a boy of about nine. In the background was a\nmiserable hovel made of crude lumber and patched windows. This couple and\ntheir baby had been discovered by a geological survey outfit living in\nthe backwoods hills. Relief, aid, and help were being rushed, and the\nlegislature was considering ways and means of their schooling. Neither\nof them could read or write.\n\nJames read the article, and his first thought was to proffer his help.\nAid and enlightenment they needed, and they needed it quickly. And then\nhe stopped immediately because he could do nothing to educate them unless\nthey already possessed the ability to read.\n\nHis second thought was one of dismay. His exultation came down with a\ndull thud. Within seconds he realized that the acquisition of a girl was\nno evidence of his competent maturity. The couple photographed were human\nbeings, but intellectually they were no more than animals with a slight\nedge in vocabulary. It made James Holden sick at heart to read the\narticle and to realize that such filth and ignorance could still go on.\nBut it took a shock of such violence to make James realize that clams,\nguppies, worms, fleas, cats, dogs, and the great whales reproduced their\nkind; intellect, education and mature competence under law had nothing to\ndo with the process whatsoever.\n\nAnd while his heart was still unhappy, he turned to page four and read an\nopen editorial that discussed the chances of The Educational Party in the\ncoming Election Year.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJames blinked.\n\n\"Splinter\" parties, the editorial said, seldom succeeded in gaining a\nprimary objective. They only succeeded in drawing votes from the other\nmajor parties, in splitting the total ballot, and dividing public\nopinion. On the other hand, they did provide a useful political\nweathervane for the major parties to watch most carefully. If the\nsplinter party succeeded in capturing a large vote, it was an indication\nthat the People found their program favorable and upon such evidence it\nbehooved the major parties to mend their political fences--or to relocate\nthem.\n\nEducation, said the editorial, was a primary issue and had been one\nfor years. There had been experimenting with education ever since\nthe Industrial Revolution uncovered the fact, in about 1900, that\nbackbreaking physical toil was going to be replaced by educated workers\noperating machinery.\n\nThen the editorial quoted Judge Norman L. Carter:\n\n\"'For many years,' said Judge Carter, 'we have deplored the situation\nwhereby a doctor or a physicist is not considered fully educated until he\nhas reached his middle or even late twenties. Yet instead of speeding up\nthe curriculum in the early school years, we have introduced such\nimportant studies as social graces, baton twirling, interpretive painting\nand dancing, and a lot of other fiddle-faddle which graduates students\nwho cannot spell, nor read a book, nor count above ten without taking off\ntheir shoes. Perhaps such studies are necessary to make sound citizens\nand graceful companions. I shall not contest the point. However, I\ncontend that a sound and basic schooling should be included--and when I\nso contend I am told by our great educators that the day is not long\nenough nor the years great enough to accomplish this very necessary end.\n\n\"'Gentlemen, we leaders of The Education Party propose to accomplish\nprecisely that which they said cannot be done!'\"\n\nThe editorial closed with the terse suggestion: Educator--Educate\nthyself!\n\nJames Holden sat stunned.\n\n_What was Judge Carter doing?_\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJames Holden arrived to find the home of Judge Norman L. Carter an upset\nmadhouse. He was stopped at the front door by a secretary at a small desk\nwhose purpose was to screen the visitors and to log them in and out in\naddition to being decorative. Above her left breast was a large enamelled\nbutton, red on top, white in the middle as a broad stripe from left to\nright, and blue below. Across the white stripe was printed CARTER in\nbold, black letters. From in back of the pin depended two broad silk\nribbons that cascaded forward over the stuffing in her brassiere and hung\nfree until they disappeared behind the edge of the desk. She eyed James\nwith curiosity. \"Young man, if you're looking for throwaways for your\ncivics class, you'll have to wait until we're better organized--\"\n\nJames eyed her with cold distaste. \"I am James Quincy Holden,\" he told\nher, \"and you have neither the authority nor the agility necessary to\nprevent my entrance.\"\n\n\"You are--I what?\"\n\n\"I live here,\" he told her flatly. \"Or didn't they provide you with this\ntidbit of vital statistic?\"\n\nWheels rotated behind the girl's eyes somewhere, and memory cells linked\ninto comprehension. \"Oh!--You're James.\"\n\n\"I said that first,\" he replied. \"Where's Judge Carter?\"\n\n\"He's in conference and cannot be disturbed.\"\n\n\"Your objection is overruled. I shall disturb him as soon as I find out\nprecisely what has been going on.\"\n\nHe went on in through the short hallway and found audible confusion. Men\nin groups of two to four stood in corners talking in bedlam. There was a\nlayer of blue smoke above their heads that broke into skirls as various\nindividuals left one group to join another. Through this vocal mob scene\nJames went veering from left to right to avoid the groupings. He stood\nwith polite insolence directly in front of two men sitting on the stairs\nuntil they made room for his passage--still talking as he went between\nthem. In his room, three were sitting on the bed and the chair holding\nglasses and, of course, smoking like the rest. James dropped his\novernight bag on a low stand and headed for his bathroom. One of the men\ncaught sight of him and said, \"Hey kid, scram!\"\n\nJames looked at the man coldly. \"You happen to be using my bedroom. You\nshould be asking my permission to do so, or perhaps apologizing for not\nhaving asked me before you moved in. I have no intention of leaving.\"\n\n\"Get the likes of him!\"\n\n\"Wait a moment, Pete. This is the Holden kid.\"\n\n\"The little genius, huh?\"\n\nJames said, \"I am no genius. I do happen to have an education that\nprovides me with the right to criticize your social behavior. I will\nneither be insulted nor patronized.\"\n\n\"Listen to him, will you!\"\n\nJames turned and with the supreme gesture of contempt, he left the door\nopen.\n\nHe wound his way through the place to Judge Carter's study and home\noffice, strode towards it with purpose and reached for the doorknob. A\nvoice halted him: \"Hey kid, you can't go in there!\"\n\nTurning to face the new voice, James said calmly,\n\n\"You mean 'may not' which implies that I have asked your permission. Your\nstatement is incorrect as phrased and erroneous when corrected.\"\n\nHe turned the knob and entered. Judge Carter sat at his desk with two\nmen; their discussion ceased with the sound of the doorknob. The judge\nlooked up in annoyance. \"Hello, James. You shouldn't have come in here.\nWe're busy. I'll let you know when I'm free.\"\n\n\"You'd better make time for me right now,\" said James angrily. \"I'd like\nto know what's going on here.\"\n\n\"This much I'll tell you quickly. We're planning a political campaign.\nNow, please--\"\n\n\"I know you're planning a political campaign,\" replied James. \"But if\nyou're proposing to campaign on the platform of a reform in education,\nI suggest that you educate your henchmen in the rudimentary elements of\npolite speech and gentle behavior. I dislike being ordered out of my room\nby usurpers who have the temerity to address me as 'hey kid'.\"\n\n\"Relax, James. I'll send them out later.\"\n\n\"I'd suggest that you tell them off,\" snapped James. He turned on his\nheel and left, heading for the cellar. In the workshop he found Professor\nWhite and Jack Cowling presiding over the machine. In the chair with the\nheadset on sat the crowning insult of all:\n\nPaul Brennan leafing through a heavy sheaf of papers, reading and\nintoning the words of political oratory.\n\nUnable to lick them, Brennan had joined them--or, wondered young Holden,\nwas Judge Norman L. Carter paying for Brennan's silence with some plum of\npolitical patronage?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs he stood there, the years of persecution rose strong in the mind of\nJames Holden. Brennan, the man who'd got away with murder and would\ncontinue to get away with it because there was no shred of evidence, no\nwitness, nothing but James Holden's knowledge of Brennan's actions when\nhe'd thought himself unseen in his calloused treatment of James Holden's\ndying mother; Brennan's critical inspection of the smashed body of his\nfather, coldly checking the dead flesh to be sure beyond doubt; the cruel\nsearch about the scene of the 'accident' for James himself--interrupted\nonly by the arrival of a Samaritan, whose name was never known to James\nHolden. In James rose the violent resentment of the years, the certain\nknowledge that any act of revenge upon Paul Brennan would be viewed as\ncold-blooded premeditated murder without cause or motive.\n\nAnd then came the angry knowledge that simple slaughter was too good for\nPaul Brennan. He was not a dog to be quickly released from misery by a\nmerciful death. Paul Brennan should suffer until he cried for death as a\nblessed release from daily living.\n\nJames Holden, angry, silently, unseen by the preoccupied workers,\nstole across the room to the main switch-panel, flipped up a small\nhalf-concealed cover, and flipped a small button.\n\nThere came a sharp _Crack_! that shattered the silence and\nre-echoed again and again through the room. The panel that held the\nrepeater-circuit of the Holden Educator bulged outward; jets of smoke\nlanced out of broken metal, bulged corners, holes and skirled into little\nclouds that drifted upward--trailing a flowing billow of thick, black,\npungent smoke that reached the low ceiling and spread outward, fanwise,\nobscuring the ceiling like a low-lying nimbus.\n\nAt the sound of the report, the man in the chair jumped as if he'd been\nstabbed where he sat.\n\n\"Ouyeowwww!\" yowled Brennan in a pitiful ululation. He fell forward from\nthe chair, asprawl on wobbly hands and knees, on elbows and knees as he\ntried to press away the torrent of agony that hammered back and forth\nfrom temple to temple. James watched Brennan with cold detachment,\nProfessor White and Jack Cowling looked on in paralyzed horror. Slowly,\noh, so slowly, Paul Brennan managed to squirm around until he was sitting\non the floor still cradling his head between his hands.\n\nJames said, \"I'm afraid that you're going to have a rough time whenever\nyou hear the word 'entrenched'.\" And then, as Brennan made no response,\nJames Holden went on, \"Or were you by chance reading the word\n'pedagogue'?\"\n\nAt the word, Brennan howled again; the pain was too much for him and he\ntoppled sidewise to writhe in kicking agony.\n\nJames smiled coldly, \"I'm sorry that you weren't reading the word 'the'.\nThe English language uses more of them than the word 'pedagogue'.\"\n\nWith remarkable effort, Brennan struggled to his feet; he lurched toward\nJames. \"I'll teach you, you little--\"\n\n\"Pedagogue?\" asked James.\n\nThe shock rocked Brennan right to the floor again.\n\n\"Better sit there and think,\" said James coldly. \"You come within a dozen\nyards of me and I'll say--\"\n\n\"No! Don't!\" screamed Paul Brennan. \"Not again!\"\n\n\"Now,\" asked James, \"what's going on here?\"\n\n\"He was memorizing a political speech,\" said Jack Cowling. \"What did you\ndo?\"\n\n\"I merely fixed my machine so that it will not be used again.\"\n\n\"But you shouldn't have done that!\"\n\n\"You shouldn't have been using it for this purpose,\" replied James. \"It\nwasn't intended to further political ambitions.\"\n\n\"But Judge Carter--\"\n\n\"Judge Carter doesn't own it,\" said James. \"I do.\"\n\n\"I'm sure that Judge Carter can explain everything.\"\n\n\"Tell him so. Then add that if he'd bothered to give me the time of day,\nI'd be less angry. He's not to be interrupted, is he? I'm ordered out of\nmy room, am I? Well, go tell the judge that his political campaign has\nbeen stopped by a fourteen-year-old boy who knows which button to push!\nI'll wait here.\"\n\nProfessor White took off; Jack Cowling smiled crookedly and shook his\nhead at James. \"You're a rash young man,\" he said. \"What did you do to\nBrennan, here?\"\n\nJames pointed at the smoke curling up out of the panel. \"I put in a\ndestructive charge to addle the circuit as a preventive measure against\ncapture or use by unauthorized persons,\" he replied. \"So I pushed the\nbutton just as Brennan was trying to memorize the word--\"\n\n\"Don't!\" cried Brennan in a pleading scream.\n\n\"You mean he's going to throw a fit every time he hears the word--\"\n\n\"No! No! Can't anybody talk without saying--Ouwwouooo!\"\n\n\"Interesting,\" commented James. \"It seems to start as soon as the\nfore-reading part of his mind predicts that the word may be next, or\nwhen he thinks about it.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that Brennan is going to be like the guy who could win the\nworld if he sat on the top of a hill for one hour and did not think of\nthe word 'Swordfish'? Except that he'll be out of pain so long as he\ndoesn't think of the word--\"\n\n\"Thing I'm interested in is that maybe our orator here doesn't know the\ndefinition thoroughly. Tell me, dear 'Uncle' Paul, does the word\n'teacher' give--Sorry. I was just experimenting. Wasn't as bad as--\"\n\nGritting his teeth and wincing with pain, Brennan said, \"Stop it!\nEven the word 'sch-(wince)-ool' hurts like--\" He thought for a\nmoment and then went on with his voice rising to a pitiful\nhowl of agony at the end: \"Even the name 'Miss Adams' gives\nme a fleeting headache all over my body, and Miss Adams was\non--ly--my--third--growww--school--Owuuuuoooo--teach--earrrrrrr--Owwww!\"\n\nBrennan collapsed in his chair just as Judge Carter came in with his\nwhite mane flying and hot fire in his attitude. \"What goes on here?\" he\nstormed at James.\n\n\"I stopped your campaign.\"\n\n\"Now see here, you young--\"\n\nJudge Carter stopped abruptly, took a deep breath and calmed himself with\na visible effort to control his rage. \"James,\" he said in a quieter\nvoice, \"Can you repair the damage quickly?\"\n\n\"Yes--but I won't.\"\n\n\"And why not?\"\n\n\"Because one of the things my father taught me was the danger of allowing\nthis machine to fall into the hands of ruthless men with political\nambition.\"\n\n\"And I am a ruthless man with political ambition?\"\n\nJames nodded. \"Under the guise of studying me and my machine,\" he said,\n\"you've been using it to train speakers, and to educate ward-heelers.\nYou've been building a political machine by buying delegates. Not with\nmoney, of course, because that is illegal. With knowledge, and because\nknowledge, education, and information are intangibles and no legality\nhas been established, and this is all very legal.\"\n\nJudge Carter smiled distantly. \"It is bad to elevate the mind of the\naverage ward-heeler? To provide the smalltime politician with a fine\ngrasp of the National Problem and how his little local problems fit into\nthe big picture? Is this making a better world, or isn't it?\"\n\n\"It's making a political machine that can't be defeated.\"\n\n\"Think not? What makes you think it can't?\"\n\n\"Pedagogue!\" said James.\n\n\"Yeowwww!\"\n\nThe judge whirled to look at Brennan. \"What was--that?\" asked the judge.\n\nJames explained what had happened, then: \"I've mentioned hazards. This is\nwhat would happen if a fuse blew in the middle of a course. Maybe he can\nbe trained out of it, and maybe not. You'll have to try, of course. But\nthink of what would happen if you and your political machine put these\nthings into schools and fixed them to make a voltage twitch or something\nwhile the student was reading the word 'republican'. You'd end up with a\nsingle-party system.\"\n\n\"And get myself assassinated by a group of righteously irate citizens,\"\nsaid Judge Carter. \"Which I would very warmly deserve. On the other hand,\nsuppose we 'treated' people to feel anguish at thoughts of murder or\nkilling, theft, treason, and other forms of human deviltry?\"\n\n\"Now that might be a fine idea.\"\n\n\"It would not,\" said Judge Carter flatly. James Holden's eyes widened,\nand he started to say something but the judge held up his hand, fingers\noutspread, and began to tick off his points finger by finger as he went\non: \"Where would we be in the case of enemy attack? Could our policemen\naim their guns at a vicious criminal if they were conditioned against\nkilling? Could our butchers operate; must our housewives live among a\nhorde of flies? Theft? Well, it's harder to justify, James, but it would\nchange the game of baseball as in 'stealing a base' or it would ruin the\ngame of love as in 'stealing a kiss'. It would ruin the mystery-story\nfield for millions of people who really haven't any inclination to go out\nand rob, steal, or kill. Treason? Our very revered Declaration of\nIndependence is an article of Treason in the eyes of King George Third;\nit wouldn't be very hard to draw a charge of treason against a man who\ncomplained about the way the Government is being run. Now, one more\nangle, James. The threat or fear of punishment hasn't deterred any\npotential felon so far as anybody knows. And I hold the odd belief that\nif we removed the quart of mixed felony, chicanery, falsehood, and\nunderhandedness from the human makeup, on that day the human race could\nstep down to take its place alongside of the cow, just one step ahead of\nthe worm.\n\n\"Now you accuse me of holding political ambition. I plead guilty of the\ncharge and demand to be shown by my accuser just what is undesirable\nabout ambition, be it political or otherwise. Have you no ambition? Of\ncourse you have. Ambition drove your folks to create this machine and\nambition drove you to the fight for your freedom. Ambition is the\ncatalyst that lifts a man above his fellows and then lifts them also.\nThere is a sort of tradition in this country that a man must not openly\nseek the office of the Presidency. I consider this downright silly. I\nhave announced my candidacy, and I intend to campaign for it as hard as\nI can. I propose to make the problem of _education_ the most important\nargument that has ever come up in a presidential campaign. I believe that\nI shall win because I shall promise to provide this accelerated education\nfor everybody who wants it.\"\n\n\"And to do this you've used my machine,\" objected James.\n\n\"Did you intend to keep it for yourself?\" snapped Judge Carter.\n\n\"No, but--\"\n\n\"And when did you intend to release it?\"\n\n\"As soon as I could handle it myself.\"\n\n\"Oh, fine!\" jeered the judge sourly. \"Now, let me orate on that subject\nfor a moment and then we'll get to the real meat of this argument. James,\nthere is no way of delivering this machine to the public without\ndelivering it to them through the hands of a capable Government agency.\nIf you try to release it as an individual you'll be swamped with cries of\nanger and pleas for special consideration. The reactionaries will shout\nthat we're moving too fast and the progressives will complain that we\naren't moving fast enough. Teachers' organizations will say that we're\nthrowing teachers out of jobs, and little petty politicians will try to\nslip their political plug into the daily course in Civics. Start your\ncompany and within a week some Madison Avenue advertising agency will be\noffering you several million dollars to let them convince people that\nHickory-Chickory Coffee is the only stuff they can pour down their gullet\nwithout causing stomach pains, acid system, jittery nerves, sleepless\nnights, flat feet, upset glands, and so on and on and on. Announce it;\nthe next day you'll have so many foreign spies in your bailiwick that\nyou'll have to hire a stadium to hold them. You'll be ducking\nintercontinental ballistic missiles because there are people who would\nkill the dog in order to get rid of the fleas. You'll start the biggest\nwar this planet has ever seen and it will go on long after you are killed\nand your father's secret is lost--and after the fallout has died off,\nwe'll have another scientific race to recreate it. And don't think that\nit can't be rediscovered by determined scientists who know that such a\nthing as the Holden Electromechanical Educator is a reality.\"\n\n\"And how do you propose to prevent this war?\"\n\n\"By broadcasting the secret as soon as we can; let the British and the\nFrench and the Russians and the Germans and all the rest build it and\nuse it as wisely as they can program it. Which, by the way, James,\nbrings us right back to James Quincy Holden, Martha Bagley, and the\nimmediate future.\"\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\n\"Yes. James, tell me after deliberation, at what point in your life did\nyou first believe that you had the competence to enter the adult world in\nfreedom to do as you believed right?\"\n\n\"Um, about five or six, as I recall.\"\n\n\"What do you think now about those days?\"\n\nJames shrugged. \"I got along.\"\n\n\"Wasn't very well, was it?\"\n\n\"No, but I was under a handicap, you know. I had to hide out.\"\n\n\"And now?\"\n\n\"Well, if I had legal ruling, I wouldn't have to hide.\"\n\n\"Think you know everything you need to know to enter this adult world?\"\n\n\"No man stops learning,\" parried James. \"I think I know enough to start.\"\n\n\"James, no matter what you say, there is a very important but intangible\nthing called 'judgment'. You have part of it, but not by far enough.\nYou've been studying the laws about ages and rights, James, but you've\nmissed a couple of them because you've been looking for evidence\nfavorable to your own argument. First, to become a duly elected member of\nthe House of Representatives, a man must be at least twenty-five years of\nage. To be a Senator, he must be at least thirty. To be President, one\nmust be at least thirty-five. Have you any idea why the framers of the\nConstitution of the United States placed such restrictions?\"\n\n\"Well, I suppose it had to do with judgment?\" replied James reluctantly.\n\n\"That--and _experience_. Experience in knowing people, in understanding\nthat there might be another side to any question, in realizing that you\nmust not approach every problem from your own purely personal point of\nview nor expect it to be solved to your own private satisfaction or to\nyour benefit. Now, let's step off a distance and take a good look at\nJames Quincy Holden and see where he lacks the necessary ingredients.\"\n\n\"Yes, tell me,\" said James, sourly.\n\n\"Oh, I intend to. Let's take the statistics first. You're four-feet\neleven-inches tall, you weigh one-hundred and three pounds, and you're a\nfew weeks over fourteen. I suppose you know that you've still got one\nmore spurt of growth, sometimes known as the post-puberty-growth. You'll\nprobably put on another foot in the next couple of years, spread out a\nbit across the shoulders, and that fuzz on your face will become a\ncollection of bristles. I suppose you think that any man in this room can\nhandle you simply because we're all larger than you are? Possibly true,\nand one of the reasons why we can't give you a ticket and let you\nproclaim yourself an adult. You can't carry the weight. But this isn't\nall. Your muscles and your bones aren't yet in equilibrium. I could find\na man of age thirty who weighed one-oh-three and stood four-eleven. He\ncould pick you up and spin you like a top on his forefinger just because\nhis bones match his muscles nicely, and his nervous system and brain have\nhad experience in driving the body he's living in.\"\n\n\"Could be, but what has all this to do with me? It does not affect the\nfact that I've been getting along in life.\"\n\n\"You get along. It isn't enough to 'get along.' You've got to have\njudgment. You claim judgment, but still you realize that you can't handle\nyour own machine. You can't even come to an equitable choice in selecting\nsome agency to handle your machine. You can't decide upon a good outlet.\nYou believe that proclaiming your legal competence will provide you with\nsome mysterious protection against the wolves and thieves and ruthless\nmen with political ambition--that this ruling will permit you to keep it\nto yourself until you decide that it is time to release it. You still\nwant to hide. You want to use it until you are so far above and beyond\nthe rest of the world that they can't catch up, once you give it to\neverybody. You now object to my plans and programs, still not knowing\nwhether I intend to use it for good or for evil--and juvenile that you\nare, it must be good or evil and cannot be an in-between shade of gray.\nMen are heroes or villains to _you_; but _I_ must say with some\nreluctance that the biggest crooks that ever held public office still\npassed laws that were beneficial to their people. There is the area in\nwhich you lack judgment, James. There and in your blindness.\"\n\n\"Blindness?\"\n\n\"Blindness,\" repeated Judge Carter. \"As Mark Twain once said, 'When I was\nseventeen, I was ashamed at the ignorance of my father, but by the time I\nwas twenty-one I was amazed to discover how much the old man had learned\nin four short years!' Confound it, James, you don't yet realize that\nthere are a lot of things in life that you can't even know about until\nyou've lived through them. You're blind here, even though your life has\nbeen a solid case of encounter with unexpected experiences, one after the\nother as you grew. Oh, you're smart enough to know that you've got to top\nthe next hill as soon as you've climbed this one, but you're not smart\nenough to realize that the next hill merely hides the one beyond, and\nthat there are still higher hills beyond that stretching to the end of\nthe road for you--and that when you've finally reached the end of your\nown road there will be more distant hills to climb for the folks that\nfollow you.\n\n\"You've a fine education, and it's helped you tremendously. But you've\nloused up your own life and the life of Martha Bagley. You two are a pair\nof outcasts, and you'll be outcasts until about ten years from now when\nyour body will have caught up with your mind so that you can join your\ncontemporaries without being regarded as a pair of intellectual freaks.\"\n\n\"And what should I have done?\" demanded James Holden angrily.\n\n\"That's just it, again. You do not now realize that there isn't anything\nyou could have done, nor is there anything you can do now. That's why I'm\ntaking over and I'm going to do it for you.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" snapped Judge Carter. \"We'll let them have their courses in baton\ntwirling and social grace and civic improvement and etiquette--and at the\nsame time we'll give them history and mathematics and spelling and\ngraduate them from 'high' school at the age of twelve or fourteen,\nintroduce an intermediary school for languages and customs of other\ncountries and in universal law and international affairs and economics,\nwhere our bookkeepers will learn science and scientists will understand\ncommercial law; our lawyers will know business and our businessmen will\nbe taught politics. After that we'll start them in college and run them\nas high as they can go, and our doctors will no longer go sour from the\nmoment they leave school at thirty-five to hang out their shingle.\n\n\"As for you, James Holden, you and Martha Bagley will attend this\npreparatory school as soon as we can set it up. There will be no more of\nthis argument about being as competent as an adult, because we oldsters\nwill still be the chiefs and you kids will be the Indians. Have I made\nmyself clear?\"\n\n\"Yes sir. But how about Brennan?\"\n\nJudge Carter looked at the unhappy man. \"You still want revenge? Won't he\nbe punished enough just hearing the word 'pedagogue'?\"\n\n\"For the love of--\"\n\n\"Don't blaspheme,\" snapped the judge. \"You'd hang if James could bring\na shred of evidence, and I'd help him if I could.\" He turned to James\nHolden. \"Now,\" he asked, \"will you repair your machine?\"\n\n\"And if I say No?\"\n\n\"Can you stand the pressure of a whole world angered because you've\ndenied them their right to an education?\"\n\n\"I suppose not.\" He looked at Brennan, at Professor White and at Jack\nCowling. \"If I've got to trust somebody,\" he said reluctantly, \"I suppose\nit might as well be you.\"\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FOUR:\n\nTHE NEW MATURITY\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN\n\n\nIt is the campus of Holden Preparatory Academy.\n\nIt is spring, but many another spring must pass before the ambitious ivy\nclimbs to smother the gray granite walls, before the stripling trees grow\nstately, before the lawn is sturdy enough to withstand the crab grass and\nthe students. Anecdote and apocrypha have yet to evolve into hallowed\ntradition. The walks ways are bare of bronze plaques because there are no\nillustrious alumni to honor; Holden Preparatory has yet to graduate its\nfirst class.\n\nIt is youth, a lusty infant whose latent power is already great enough\nto move the world. As it rises, the world rises with it for the whole\nconsists of all its parts; no man moves alone.\n\nThe movement has its supporters and its enemies, and between them lies a\nvast apathy of folks who simply don't give a damn. It supporters deplore\nthe dolts and the sluggards who either cannot or will not be educated.\nIts enemies see it as a danger to their comfortable position of eminence\nand claim bitterly that the honored degree of doctor is being degraded.\nThey refuse to see that it is not the degradation of the standard but\nrather the exaltation of the norm. Comfortable, they lazily object to the\nnecessity of rising with the norm to keep their position. Nor do they\nrealize that the ones who will be assaulting their fortress will\nthemselves be fighting still stronger youth one day when the mistakes are\ncorrected and the program streamlined through experience.\n\nOn the virgin lawn, in a spot that will someday lie in the shade of a\ngreat oak, a group of students sit, sprawl, lie. The oldest of them is\nsixteen, and it is true that not one of them has any reverence for\ncollege degrees, because the entrance requirements demand the scholastic\nlevel of bachelor in the arts, the sciences, in language and literature.\nThe mark of their progress is not stated in grades, but rather in the\nnumber of supplementary degrees for which they qualify. The honors of\ntheir graduation are noted by the number of doctorates they acquire.\nTheir goal is the title of Scholar, without which they may not attend\ncollege for their ultimate education.\n\nBut they do not have the \"look of eagles\" nor do they act as if they felt\nsome divine purpose fill their lives. They do not lead the pack in an\neasy lope, for who holds rank when admirals meet? They are not dedicated\nnor single-minded; if their jokes and pranks start on a higher or lower\nplane, it is just because they have better minds than their forebears at\nthe same time.\n\nOn the fringe of this group, an olive-skinned Brazilian co-ed asks:\n\"Where's Martha?\"\n\nJohn Philips looks up from a diagram of fieldmatrics he's been using to\nlay out a football play. \"She's lending moral support to Holden. He's\nsweating out his scholar's impromptu this afternoon.\"\n\n\"Why should he be stewing?\"\n\nJohn Philips smiles knowingly. \"Tony Dirk put the triple-whammy on him.\nGimmicked up the random-choice selector in the Regent's office. Herr von\nJames is discoursing on the subjects of Medicine, Astronomy, and\nPsychology--that is if Dirk knows his stuff.\"\n\nTony Dirk looks down from his study of a fluffy cloud. \"Anybody care to\nhazard some loose change on my ability?\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" replies Philips, \"we figure that the first graduating class could\nuse a professional _Astrologer_! We'll be the first in history to have\none--if M'sieu Holden can tie Medicine, Astronomy, and Psychology into\nsomething cogent in his impromptu.\"\n\nIt is a strange tongue they are using, probably the first birth-pains of\na truly universal language. By some tacit agreement, personal questions\nare voiced in French, the reply in Spanish. Impersonal questions are\nItalian and the response in Portuguese. Anything of a scientific nature\nmust be in German; law, language, or literature in English; art in\nJapanese; music in Greek; medicine in Latin; agriculture in Czech.\nAnything laudatory in Mandarin, derogatory in Sanskrit--and _ad libitum_\nat any point for any subject.\n\nAnita Lowes has been trying to attract the attention of John Philips from\nhis diagram long enough to invite her to the Spring Festival by reciting\na low-voiced string of nuclear equations carefully compounded to make\nthem sound naughty unless they're properly identified with full\nattention. She looks up and says, \"What if he doesn't make the\nconnection?\"\n\nPhilips replies, \"Well, if he can prove to that tough bunch that there\nis no possible advance in learning through a combination of Astronomy,\nMedicine, and Psychology, he'll make it on that basis. It's just as\nimportant to close a door as it is to open one, you know. But it's one\nrough deal to prove negation. Maybe we'll have James the Holden on our\nhands for another semester. Martha will like that.\"\n\n\"Talking about me?\"\n\nThere is a rolling motion, sort of like a bushel of fish trying to leap\nback into the sea. The newcomer is Martha Fisher. At fifteen, her eyes\nare bright, and her features are beginning to soften into the beginning\nof a beauty that will deepen with maturity.\n\n\"James,\" says Tony Dirk. \"We figured you'd like to have him around\nanother four months. So we gimmicked him.\"\n\n\"You mean that test-trio?\" chuckles Martha.\n\n\"How's he doing?\"\n\n\"When I left, he was wriggling his way through probability math, showing\nthe relationship between his three subjects and the solution for random\nchoice figures which may or may not be shaded by known or not-known\nagency. He's covered Mason's History of Superstition and--\"\n\n\"Superstition?\" asks a Japanese.\n\nMartha nods. \"He claimed superstition is based upon fear and faith, and\nhe feared that someone had tampered with his random choice of subjects,\nand he had faith that it was one of his buddies. So--\"\n\nMartha is interrupted by a shout. The years have done well by James\nHolden, too. He is a lithe sixteen. It is a long time since he formed his\nlittle theory of human pair-production and it is almost as long since\nhe thought of it last. If he reconsiders it now, he does not recognize\nhis part in it because everything looks different from within the circle.\nHis world, like the organization of the Universe, is made up of schools\ncontaining classes of groups of clusters of sets of associations created\nby combinations and permutations of individuals.\n\n\"I made it!\" he says.\n\nJames has his problems. Big ones. Shall he go to Harvard alone, or shall\nhe go to coeducational California with the hope that Martha will follow\nhim? Then there was the fun awaiting him at Heidelberg, the historic\nbackground of Pisa, the vigorous routine at Tokyo. As a Scholar, he has\ncontributed original research in four or five fields to attain\ndoctorates, now he is to pick a few allied fields, combine certain phases\nof them, and work for his Specific. It is James Holden's determination to\nprove that the son is worthy of the parents for which his school is\nnamed.\n\nBut there is high competition. At Carter tech-prep, a girl is struggling\nto arrange a Periodic Chart of the Nucleons. At Maxwell, one of his\ncontemporaries will contend that the human spleen acts as an ion-exchange\norgan to rid the human body of radioactive minerals, and he will someday\ndie trying to prove it. His own classmate Tony Dirk will organize a\nweather-control program, and John Philips will write six lines of odd\nsymbols that will be called the Inertiogravitic Equations.\n\nTheir children will reach the distant stars, and their children's\nchildren will, humanlike, cross the vast chasm that lies between one\nswirl of matter and the other before they have barely touched their home\ngalaxy.\n\nNo man is an island, near or far on Earth as it is across the glowing\nclusters of galaxies--nay, as it may be in Heaven itself.\n\nThe motto is cut deep in the granite over the doorway to Holden Hall:\n\nYOU YOURSELF\nMUST LIGHT THE FAGGOTS\nTHAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Fourth R, by George Oliver Smith\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE FOURTH R ***\n\n***** This file should be named 18602-8.txt or 18602-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/8/6/0/18602/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
