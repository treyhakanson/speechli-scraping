But they did not hesitate because the first question asked\n    them had been: \"Are you a brave man?\"_\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n_Opportunity_\n\n\nFrom where Dick Barrow sat, hundreds of men were visible, occupying\nbenches in every manner of position. Some stretched at full length,\nsleeping in the morning sun after a night in the park. Others sat with\nheads hanging; thinking thoughts of their own.\n\nDepression or recession, it meant the same to all of them. Some didn't\ncare, but others tried to find any kind of work that would fill their\nstomachs with food.\n\nFor three days Dick hadn't eaten a good meal, and felt almost as low as\nthe derelicts whom he had for companions. He would have enjoyed a smoke,\nbut turned away as two men dove for a cigarette-butt; discarded by a\npasserby.\n\nAnyone who could afford to buy a newspaper was an aristocrat, and Dick\nwatched until he saw one discarded. For three days he had been reading\nthem secondhand, but the only jobs were too far to walk and apply for.\n\nHis eyes stopped at one item in the column and a puzzled frown slowly\npuckered his forehead.\n\n    _Wanted: An Engineer. Young man with love for electrical and\n    mechanical work, who is not afraid of isolation. Have some knowledge\n    of engineering, but general experience more desirable than\n    specialized training. Must be willing to leave country, never to\n    return; for which he will be well remunerated. Have no close family\n    ties, and willing to submit to certain amount of danger. Will be\n    isolated with few members of own race, but will have great\n    opportunity to develop mastery of huge machines. Come prepared to\n    leave for post immediately, without preparation. Every want will be\n    taken care of by employers. This position is for lifetime, without\n    opportunity of turning back after having accepted responsibility.\n    GREAT OPPORTUNITY! Room 36, 18 W. Morgan Ave., City._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a long time Dick Barrow gazed at the ad, mentally comparing his own\nqualifications for the position--and they _seemed_ to fit! He was not a\ngraduate engineer, being forced to quit school after two years of study.\nThree years later his father died, then Dick lost the job that had kept\nthem eating regularly. His love of mechanics remained insatiable, and he\nconstantly hoped for work which would allow him to use his knowledge and\nability.\n\nHe had no relations, and the _only_ girl had forgotten him, when he left\nschool. He heard that she married a classmate!\n\nDick was twenty-seven. Five years had slipped by since he quit school,\nand he couldn't remember where they had gone. It was only six months\nafter his father died that he lost his last regular job. He tried\nselling and was a failure. He had been carpenter's helper, plumber's\nhelper, porter, counter-man and busboy as the months passed, but nothing\nsteady. For the past two months he had been hunting for work, while his\nfew dollars dwindled to where he no longer had room rent. Then it was\nthe park.\n\nHis feet were sore and blistered from holes in his shoes, and he limped\nwith every step. It took so long to reach the address that there was\nlittle chance of finding the job still open. It was not the first time\nhe had missed--for the same reason.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe found that 18 Morgan Avenue was a dreary structure, appearing as if\nit had been standing twenty years too long. The wooden stairs creaked as\nhe rested his weight on first one sore foot and then the other. Room 36\nwas at the top of the five-story building, and it seemed ages before he\nreached the doorway. The only sign of furnishing in the room was a hard\nbench, occupied by three men. Dick had to stand while his feet tortured\nhim, but it was hopeful to see men waiting--_the job wasn't filled_!\n\nSuddenly a door at the opposite side of the room jerked open and a man\ndashed through.\n\n\"Get out of here! The man's _insane_!\"\n\nTwo of the men followed, but the man who remained on the bench glanced\nat Dick, grinned, shrugged his shoulders and entered the door. A moment\nlater his booming voice could be heard through the thin partition,\nalthough his words were not clear.\n\nAn hour passed while Dick waited. When the man came out, with a smile on\nhis face, he wished Dick luck and headed for the stairway.\n\nBarrow felt a queer sensation as he stepped through the inner doorway. A\nman faced him in a huge leather chair across the room. At least Dick\nthought he was a man. Grotesque in every way, his body was small while\nhis head was twice as large as normal. He was light complexioned, with\nalmost white hair thinly covering the top of his enormous head. His\nfeatures were finely cut, with large aquiline nose. He was not\nrepulsive, and smiled in welcome as Dick hesitated at the threshold.\nWhen he spoke his tone was soft and musical.\n\n\"Welcome, stranger. You have come in answer to my advertisement and I\nwill explain without wasting time. But first tell me about yourself.\"\n\nGoing over his complete life history, including the two years in\ncollege, Dick came to the lean years when his father died. He hesitated\nslightly not proud of this period.\n\n\"Go on, Mr. Barrow. It is not important to have been a success in\nbusiness, and I will not consider that in your applications. It isn't\nwhat you _have_ done, but what you _want_ to do, that interests me.\"\n\nHe spoke with a strange accent, that Dick didn't recognize. But he was\npleasant and made it easy to talk.\n\nWhen Barrow finished, by relating the finding of the newspaper and the\nlong walk to the office, the queer man was smiling.\n\n\"I like your frankness and will tell you about the position, although I\ncan't reveal the location of your work. It is not on any map, and you\nwill work among a race such as myself, with no opportunity of leaving\nafter reaching the destination.\n\n\"You will be given every comfort and advantage among my people, and be\nrequired to work hard in return. There are several machines out of\ncommission which must be repaired and put to work again. After a few\nmonths your work will be easier, although you must constantly watch all\nmachinery to see that it is in perfect condition, and does not stop work\nfor even a moment.\n\n\"My people use mechanics of greater size and development than anything\nyou have ever seen, and our lives depend on its perfect operation. In\norder to accept this position you must be married. Your wife must come\nwith you, and be willing to accept the same living conditions which are\noffered to you.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The man who left this office as you entered has a fiancee and has gone\nto talk it over with her. In your instance _I must select your wife_!\nYou will be the leader of the workmen whom I take back. There will be\nonly a few people such as yourself, and you can never again see others\nof your race.\n\n\"You will have power and wealth among my people, and every type of\nentertainment that you desire. But remember that you leave your race\nforever, with _no possibility_ of return! If you accept my offer you\nmust trust entirely in what I say about the future.\"\n\nWhen the man finished speaking Dick was quiet for a long time.\nEverything seemed so unreal, so different from what he had expected. He\nmust be willing to leave everything that he had always known--to enter\nan existence which he didn't understand--without chance of return! Yet\nhe believed every word this man spoke, impossible as it seemed. But\n_marriage_ ... with a girl he had never _seen_!\n\nThe man spoke again. \"You hesitate about marrying; I can see it in your\neyes. But remember that _she_ must accept without knowing you, and is\ntaking just as great a chance. This I can say. She will be brilliant,\nand I _could not_ trust you to pick out a brilliant woman for your wife.\nLove would come first in your eyes. Other things would seem unimportant.\nI know that you and the girl I select are apt to fall in love, as I\nshall choose a girl suitable to your temperament.\"\n\nDick answered slowly, \"I don't know what to say. I will have to live\nwith her all of my life, and if we are not happy anything you could\noffer would mean nothing.\"\n\nThe smile spread over the strange man's face again. \"I wouldn't worry\ntoo much. I believe you could stand a greater chance of happiness if _I_\ndo the choosing than if you do it yourself as I can see more of the\nfuture. If you are mutually likable and willing to understand each\nother; if you are mentally on the same level, there is little chance of\n_not_ falling in love. My race mates in this way, and it works out\nbetter than your haphazard mating.\"\n\nWhen he realized that Dick still hesitated, he was slightly upset. Then\nreaching into a leather bag, hung from a strap around his neck, he\nstretched forth a handful of bills.\n\n\"Go and get yourself a good meal. It is now morning. When two more\nmornings have passed come again. Don't be afraid to use the money for\nanything that you desire. This does not mean that I expect you to accept\nthe offer, but it will allow you to think it over carefully--without\nthinking of your _stomach_. Buy clothes, a room to sleep in, anything\nelse that you want. Be comfortable and do not worry about what you\nspend. If you refuse my terms, I will be disappointed, but will not\nexpect to be repaid.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs Dick reached the street he shook his head. It all seemed so\nfantastic. But the money in his hand was real money--and there was a lot\nof it! Suddenly he realized that people were staring at the handful of\nbills, and he hurriedly stuffed them in a pocket. When he was alone for\na moment he stepped into a vacant doorway to count it.\n\nThere were 14 twenties, 10 fifties, and three ten dollar bills in the\nlot. Twenty-seven bills in all, representing eight hundred and ten\ndollars. Folding the money carefully and placing it in a safe pocket, he\nnoticed a sign across the street. \"SHOES,\" it said. He glanced at his\nown, then limped slowly across when the traffic lights changed. For a\nmoment he looked in the window, then stepped inside.\n\nWhile the shoe clerk was busy he carefully slipped a twenty from the\nother bills. It would seem strange if he had too much money with his\nfeet in such shape.\n\nThe next stop was a restaurant. Then followed a trip to a clothing\nstore--and he left his old suit behind. With new clothes, shoes, and a\nmeal beneath his belt, he began to think the offer of the stranger was\nfar from fantastic. What if he did have to marry a strange girl? At\nleast they would both have comfort and companionship, wherever they\nwent.\n\nBarrow's first appointment was on Tuesday morning, and Friday found him\nclimbing the same stairs. He watched the papers but there had been no\nrepetition of the advertisement. Evidently the strange man had all the\napplicants he wanted.\n\nThe outer office was empty, but when he opened the inner door, the queer\nman was smiling just as Dick remembered him.\n\n\"Come in, Mr. Barrow. I'm glad to see you. I was surprised to hear of\nyour use of the money, but was pleased rather than disappointed. You did\nwell.\"\n\nFor a moment Dick was taken back, then he smiled sheepishly. \"I don't\nknow just what to say, Sir, I did so many things. But I didn't know I\nwas being watched.\"\n\n\"Every move you made was watched carefully, and reported to me. I know\nwhere you spent every hour since you left here the other morning. I\nwanted to know how you would act with money enough to do as you pleased\nfor a few days. You acted wisely, and I'm glad that you spent so much of\nit on men who need it. You bought twenty-two pairs of shoes, thirty-six\nshirts and forty-five suits of underwear. You also bought cheap suits\nfor nine men and several odd and end accessories as well.\n\n\"Out of the total sum you spent less than one hundred dollars for\nyourself, and yet you have only forty-two dollars of the sum I handed\nyou. The remainder you used for meals and cheap lodging for the men you\nhave taken care of in the past three days. You have gone through a lot\nof money since you were here.\"\n\nDick stammered as he spoke, \"I'm sorry, sir, but I thought--\"\n\n\"You thought _just right_! I _did_ give you the money to use as you\npleased and I'm proud of the way you spent it. But I want to know the\nanswer. You must have decided by this time. If the answer is yes, you\nwill bind yourself to a lifetime of work. If it is no, we will say\ngoodbye.\"\n\nDick's face lighted with a smile. \"The answer is _yes_. I am proud to\nleave my future in your hands--even to my marriage. I made up my mind to\ndo as you desire, and am prepared to leave any time you are ready. I\nhope you have hired every one you need and that we will all enjoy our\nnew work.\"\n\n\"You're a brave man, Dick Barrow.\" There was admiration in the voice of\nthe stranger. \"If you remained here I believe you would make your mark\nin life, but you will have even greater opportunity where you are going.\nI believe your decision will prove to be a happy one.\n\n\"You must stay at a good hotel. Reasonable if you want, although it is\nnot important. I will send the girl to you within a few days. You will\nbe married as soon as possible after you meet her.\n\n\"She will bring a letter and will do exactly as you say. I will allow\ntime for you to get acquainted before I have further orders. From that\ntime you will obey my orders explicitly and follow every instruction\nwithout question. Every member of the party will take orders from you,\nand _you must give them_!\"\n\nOnce more Dick was handed a handful of bills as he prepared to leave,\nand knew there was even more than the first time. But he would live in\nconstant dread of meeting the girl he was to marry. As he started to\nopen the door, the man spoke again.\n\n\"Use the money as you desire. It will be your last chance of spending\nany and I want you to enjoy yourself as much as possible during the time\nremaining. Do what you like for the men in the park or any others you\nwish to help. If you need more money send a messenger to this room, but\ndon't come yourself. Don't contact me again until my orders require it.\nHave a good time.\"\n\nDick felt that he was living a dream, but a very pleasant one. Just one\nthought disturbed him. Who the girl would be--and what she would be\nlike?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n_Out to Sea_\n\n\nThe following morning an advertisement appeared in the papers, under the\nheading of help wanted: woman. It was the same address on Morgan Avenue.\nHis heart sank! The man was _advertising_ for a wife! Now Barrow _knew_\nhe was in for a tough streak of luck. He read it carefully.\n\n    _Opportunity for young lady. Must be of age, single, brilliant, with\n    good family background. Higher education not necessary. Must be\n    willing to travel long distance. Must not be averse to marriage with\n    brilliant young man; give up all former associations, with no\n    possibility of return; live life in small community of own race,\n    with no possibility of communication with former home. Must be\n    without close family ties, or relationship. Opportunity to live life\n    of luxury and ease, with amiable group far from present home and\n    civilization. Young lady who fits qualifications will not regret\n    applying for position. Honor, love and security will be her reward.\n    OPPORTUNITY! Room 36, 18 West Morgan Avenue, City._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhile Dick was eating dinner on Tuesday evening, a young lady fell\nheadlong in front of his table. A moment later she was seated in the\nchair opposite his own. Ten minutes later he was ordering her dinner.\n\nAfterward, as they walked toward a movie, Dick felt as if he was\ncommitting a crime. He was supposed to meet his future wife--and instead\nwas entertaining this young lady who had fallen into his life. When he\nlearned that she was staying at the same hotel, they made a date for\nbreakfast the next morning.\n\nDolores Dunbar was good company, and seemed willing to spend most of her\ntime in Dick's company. He learned that she was as friendless as\nhimself, and wondered why they couldn't have met before he made the\nstrange bargain. But as the third day drew to a close she appeared\napprehensive.\n\nWhen she kept glancing around, as if expecting someone, Dick became\ncurious, and felt rather hurt to think she was looking for someone else.\nFinally she spoke.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Dick, that I've made use of you the way I have, but I was\nordered to do it. You see, my employer told me to meet you and spend\nevery possible moment in your company. He also said that I would become\nacquainted with someone through you, and that you would know who he was,\nwhen I said I came from the large-headed man on Morgan Avenue--with a\nletter.\"\n\nFor a moment Dick was stunned. Then he laughed, a sickly, half-hearted\nlaugh. When he found his voice it squeaked.\n\n\"I think we had better go to my room. We have some very private things\nto say.\"\n\nThe queer man had succeeded in their being together for three days\nbefore either knew _they_ were the central figures in the drama. Now\nthey felt farther apart than at any moment since they had met, but\nnervously admitted they had fared better than they expected.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were married in the morning, to keep the agreement, but didn't\nconsider it part of the bargain to live as man and wife.\n\nDick found only one order in the letter, to be at the office at ten\no'clock on Tuesday morning. That left five days to enjoy themselves.\n\nIn spite of the stiffness between them Dick noticed how the light caught\nin Dolores' dark hair, and how her brown eyes sparkled at each new\nsight. Her head reached just above his shoulder, and he had never danced\nwith a better partner. She enjoyed his company, and admitted to herself\nthat he was a perfect gentleman.\n\nDuring the five days they saw every good show, and visited every popular\nnight club. Things they had always wanted to do were packed into the\nshort time to themselves. Dick hired a car, and they drove for hours\nthrough the country. When Tuesday morning came they were tired, and it\nwas hard to get up in time to keep the appointment.\n\nWhen they opened the door, the big-headed man laughed at their yawns. \"I\nsee that you've either _been_ enjoying yourselves, or have been _trying_\nmighty hard. You can make up your sleep from now on, as it will be a\nlong time before we reach our destination. How do you like each other\nfor permanent companions?\"\n\nTheir faces grew crimson. Finally Dick found his voice. \"I'm perfectly\nsatisfied, Sir. I think Dolores is very pretty, and is _very_ good\ncompany!\"\n\nHe looked the other way to hide his embarrassment, as the girl spoke.\n\n\"I feel the same way. We have enjoyed being together, and perhaps when\nwe are better acquainted the stiffness will disappear. We both feel odd,\nbecause we were required to marry!\"\n\nThe strange man laughed out loud at this. \"In other words you _might_\nhave fallen in love, if you had been allowed time to do it. But _having_\nto marry creates an entirely different feeling. I believe it will work\nout well, even though you feel cheated at the moment. But we haven't any\ntime to lose. Everyone is at the dock and we sail in two hours.\n\n\"Here are your instructions, Dick. From now on _you_ give the orders,\nand I remain in the background. They will all feel more comfortable\nunder the command of one of their own race. Study everything carefully\non the way to the dock, then give them as your own orders.\"\n\nDick had little time for anything except to look through the sheaf of\npapers. On one sheet was a list of seven couples, with stateroom numbers\nbeside each. His own was on the top, with number three room. This he\ndropped in a side pocket where it would be easy to find. The remainder\nwas in connection with sailing.\n\nDick, Dolores and the big-headed man occupied one cab, while the baggage\nfollowed in another. Dolores had obtained quite a wardrobe, much to the\namusement of her employer. But the man spoke only once during the trip.\n\n\"Everyone in the party must consider that they work for you, Dick. You\nmust hear all complaints and settle all differences. They must not\napproach me for any reason. I am known as Morquil, of section one, which\nyou will understand when we reach our destination.\"\n\nThe crew was hurrying back and forth on the deck of the small ship,\ntaking care of last-minute details. A group of people were gathered\nbeside a huge stack of baggage, and Dick walked toward them without\nwaiting for the others.\n\nDolores went up the gangplank beside Morquil, helping him slightly. He\nseemed to have difficulty in supporting his enormous head with the\nslight body.\n\nAs Dick reached the group, he read the names from the list in his hand.\n\"Mr. and Mrs. John McCarthy. You are in stateroom number seven. Take\nwhat baggage you can carry, the rest will be put on board.\" He called\neach name and stateroom; they headed for the ship. John McCarthy he\nfound was the man he had met in the office, and he _still_ had his\nperpetual grin. Evidently his fiancee had agreed to the pact for they\nwere now man and wife.\n\nWhen Dick started toward the ship, after watching the baggage put on\nboard, he was stopped by a tap on the shoulder. The cab drivers were\nstill waiting for their money. Morquil had left everything in his hands,\neven to paying for the motor trip to the dock.\n\nIt was a strange departure, with only a few people on the dock to say\ngoodbye. Even they were just neighbors of the passengers. Most of the\nwomen on board were crying as the _Primrose_ nosed out through the\nharbor toward the open sea.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDick was still at the rail when the captain approached. \"I'm sorry to\nbother you, Mr. Barrow, but I must know our destination so I can set the\ncourse.\"\n\nThe young leader's day dreaming was cut short, to jerk him back to his\nduties. He felt that the lives and hopes of everyone on the ship had\nbeen thrust into his hands.\n\nEven the captain didn't know where they were going. The ship had been\nchartered for a voyage of several months, to an unknown destination. He\nand the crew were well paid, and didn't care where they went.\n\nDick drew a sealed envelope from his pocket, detached a slip of paper\nand handed it to the captain. He read the note, then repeated it. \"You\nare to keep the destination to yourself. No one on the ship is to know\nwhere we are going, and you will not mention it to me again. I hope that\nwe have good weather, Captain, and a fast trip.\"\n\nBarrow felt like a fool. Repeating messages as if they were his\nown--without the slightest knowledge of what they were about. _He_ was\nsupposedly charting the course--and didn't have the slightest idea where\nthey were going.\n\nWhen Dick reached his stateroom (after answering questions from everyone\non board--and telling them nothing) he found Dolores sobbing. She had\nkept her smile until the boat sailed. Now she was crying her eyes out.\nIt was not a new sight, as every woman on the ship seemed occupied in\nthe same way, with the men trying to comfort them.\n\nAs Dick sat down beside her, he could feel the throb of the diesel\nmotor. It seemed to carry the rhythm of adventure through the walls of\nthe cabin, giving the feeling of the unknown. For a long time there was\nsilence while Dolores held one of Dick's hands for protection.\n\n\"Dick! We only have _one_ cabin! I'm supposed to stay here with you--and\nI _hardly know you_! Morquil told me that I must stay here, there are no\nextra rooms.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Dolores. We will just have to put up with things as they\nare. We've got into this and will have to see it through. After all, we\n_are_ man and wife, and the people on board would think it strange if we\ndidn't occupy the same room. There are two bunks, so I won't have to\nsleep on the floor. It will be a long trip, and we might as well enjoy\nit as much as possible.\"\n\nDays changed into weeks as the ship plowed steadily south. They stopped\nat one port for a few hours to refuel, but there was little to see. The\nship was slow and it felt good to walk on land again. But no one spoke\nenough English to answer questions.\n\nIt was the only time they sighted land until just before the end of the\ntrip, when small islands began to slide by. Some within a few hundred\nfeet, others just visible in the distance. Morquil hadn't appeared on\ndeck during the entire trip, but now he approached the rail.\n\nHis face lighted with an ethereal glow as he gazed across the blue\nwater. He looked like a man who was sighting his home after many years\nof absence. Dick couldn't help but feel glad for him, while cold chills\nof misgiving crept up and down his own spine. Their voyage was ending at\na far different place that he had pictured in his mind, and quite the\nopposite of the description which Morquil had given of gigantic\nmechanical development.\n\nThey were passing by small south-sea islands, where mechanical equipment\nwas out of the question. They hardly appeared _habitable_!\n\nWhen the captain approached Dick, Morquil joined the conversation.\n\"_I'll_ give you the directions, Captain. Mr. Barrow is not feeling\nwell, and I can do it for him.\n\n\"In about an hour we will reach the island, and I will point out the\nentrance to the harbor. It is well protected and there is no need to\nworry about any storm while we unload.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEvery inch of space in the ship was packed with supplies. There were\ncrates of books as well as pieces of machinery. Considerable radio\nequipment included assembled sets as well as parts. There were rifles\nand even one small cannon. Several crates of chickens and turkeys joined\nthe other things on the beach. Then to the amazement of the party, a\ncrate of pigs appeared.\n\nIt required three days to empty the ship, and with each passing hour the\nlittle party grew more apprehensive. It seemed as if they had been\ntransferred to an island to start a _new_ civilization, instead of a\nplace where mechanical development was far advanced. Because Dick was\nthe leader of the party, the others began to look at him with hatred;\nMorquil was almost forgotten.\n\nWhen the last piece of equipment was covered with heavy tarpaulins, they\nconstructed a shelter against one side of the pile. It was almost dark\nwhen everything was finished, and the captain decided to wait until the\nnext day to sail. Everyone was invited on board the _Primrose_, for a\nfarewell party.\n\nDick was forced to call a meeting in the main cabin, to forestall danger\nof the party deserting with the ship. Morquil had instructed him\ncarefully.\n\n\"Friends, we are facing a great adventure. I'm in no different position\nthan you, except that as leader I am responsible for whatever happens. I\nmust take all blame for whatever comes, yet know that it will eventually\nwork out as we expected.\n\n\"You all know that it is forbidden to talk about this trip, or to\nsurmise our destination. I can assure you that it is done for your\nbenefit, and later you will appreciate the fact that you did _not_ know\nthe future. I can't say what the next few days will bring to all of us,\nbut be assured that everything you have been promised will be fulfilled.\n\n\"At the moment it seems impossible that things can turn out as we\nexpected, but they _will_! You must simply be patient, and do not lose\nfaith in this great adventure.\"\n\nAs Dick finished his speech, Morquil smiled, well satisfied. Dolores\neven smiled faintly, although it required effort to overcome her feeling\nof disaster.\n\nThe following morning everyone went ashore, and John McCarthy went\naround trying to aid Barrow in cheering up the party. He lied like a\ntrooper, whispering to everyone that he had discovered something that\nsatisfied _him_ about the marvelous civilization they would reach before\nlong.\n\nWord of this reached Morquil, and he hurriedly called Dick and John out\nof sound of the others. He appeared almost frightened, and the moment\nthey were alone, he spoke.\n\n\"What have you learned? I wanted you to know nothing, and it is better\nif you are ignorant. Whatever you learned is too much, and may upset the\nfuture.\"\n\nJohn started to laugh, then seeing the expression of agony on the face\nof Morquil, he stopped short. \"Don't worry. I haven't learned\n_anything_! I simply tried to help Dick keep the people satisfied. They\nwere getting so restless they _needed_ something. In my home town I was\nknown as a famous liar, and thought my ability might come in handy.\"\n\nSlowly the agony disappeared from Morquil's face. \"Someday you will\nunderstand how much you have done for me, John. You will never regret\nit!\"\n\nThe McCarthys remained jovial, and tried to keep up the spirits of the\nothers as the days of loneliness passed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPhilip Jones and his wife were quiet, and waited patiently. Andrew and\nEmma Smith had taken over the cooking, and served the meals. George and\nMary Martin were the youngest couple, and Dick doubted whether either of\nthem was past twenty-one. The others were all nearer thirty. They spent\ntheir time side by side, gazing over the sea, perfectly happy in each\nother's company.\n\nJerold Brown and Peter Yarbro were constantly fishing, from the\ncollapsible boat, while their wives played cards.\n\nOne night they were awakened by brilliant flashes of light. Running to\nthe beach, they watched in amazement.\n\nThey appeared like big guns firing just above the surface of the water,\na few miles away. While they watched they gradually faded out. It was\nlike a terrific electric storm, and the little party drew close together\nfor comfort.\n\nWhen the lights faded out entirely, Morquil told them to get some sleep.\nThey would have to move equipment aboard a new ship the following day.\n\nWith the first streak of dawn Dick was back at the edge of the beach,\nstraining his eyes into the gloom, but it was almost an hour before any\nobject was visible.\n\nAfter breakfast the ship was much plainer. They could see a rounded\nhull, like the top of a huge submarine, above the water. One of the\nwomen remarked that she would _stay_ on the island before she'd enter an\nundersea ship. The trip on the _Primrose_ was bad enough, but it wasn't\n_below_ the surface.\n\nMorquil called them within the canvas shelter, as if to make a speech.\nHe held a small ball in one hand, and while they waited for instructions\nit landed in their midst.\n\nA cloud of yellow vapor burst from the object, and everyone in the party\nslowly sank to the ground. Morquil joined the others in unconscious\nstupor, a victim of his own gas.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n_Strange Destination_\n\n\nWhen Dick opened his eyes, there was a feeling of motion to the bed. The\nstrangeness of the ceiling overhead drew his attention. It was not\ncanvas, but shiny metal, almost purple in tint.\n\nSuddenly he sat up. Dolores lay beside him. As his eyes cleared of the\nlingering mist, objects in the room became plainer. They were in a\nluxuriously equipped cabin.\n\nDolores slowly opened her eyes. A moment later she sat up beside him.\nGlancing through the porthole, beyond the bed, she turned away with a\ngroan.\n\n\"We _are_ under water! And deep! I can't see a thing but strange blue\nlight.\"\n\nWhen Dick joined her, his forehead puckered in a frown. \"No, Dolores. It\ndoesn't look like water, it looks more like--No! _It can't be!_\"\n\nFor several minutes there was silence while he gazed through the\nopening. Dolores had lost interest in the outside and was examining the\nfittings of the cabin. It had everything that could be desired in a\nfirst class hotel room, and many little toilet articles besides.\n\nSuddenly Dick turned away. \"_It's true!_ We're in the air--_or above\nit_! Dolores, this ship is an _aircraft_!\"\n\n\"Never mind, Dick, this room is _beautiful_! Whether we're flying or\nswimming, this is the nicest room I ever had. It has _everything_, and\n_look_ at the dressing table!\"\n\nDick sat down in amazement, a smile slowly spreading over his face.\nDolores was happy--wherever they were. The room was all that mattered.\nBut he couldn't understand why Morquil had gassed them, and put them on\nboard unconscious. _He_ would have enjoyed seeing the new ship.\n\nWhen a knock sounded at the door, Dolores was unpacking her clothes for\nthe first time since they left the _Primrose_. Turning the knob, Morquil\nstepped in.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Dick, that I had to use gas, but I knew the people would be\nafraid of boarding this ship. John McCarthy is down in the power room\nalready, examining the machines, but some of the others are upset about\nthe transfer from the island. I hope you don't feel resentful?\"\n\n\"No, Morquil. We're satisfied. If you don't believe it--look at Dolores.\nShe decided to like this room the minute she saw it, and is unpacking\nalready.\"\n\nThe worried expression disappeared from the strange man's face. \"I had\nthe cabins equipped for women, as I know they are particular about such\nthings.\"\n\n\"Would you like to see the ship? It will be your home for a long time,\nand you might as well get acquainted. I'm sorry that no one but myself\nunderstands English, but you will have ample time to learn our language\nduring the voyage. You must speak it fluently by the time we arrive.\"\n\nAs they started out, Dolores dropped the dress she was holding, to join\nthem. Curiosity overcame the desire to straighten out her clothes.\n\nEntering a wide passage, they turned to the right. It ended abruptly in\na room with several comfortable chairs. Three tables occupied the center\nin uneven positions, the underparts filled with metal-covered books.\nTwo men of Morquil's race looked up at their approach.\n\nDick returned their friendly smile. When Dolores smiled they appeared\nembarrassed; but truly greatly pleased. Barrow noticed that one of them\nwas examining a book in English; the illustrations seemed to fascinate\nhim.\n\nA narrow passage, beyond the main cabin, led to the control room where\nthree men sat in swivel chairs. The instrument board was a marvel to\nDick, and he watched for several minutes. It would require months to\nunderstand even a small portion of the gauges.\n\nThe ship was built with two decks, and a large hold beneath the lower\nfloor which contained the machinery. The strange men were quartered on\nthe lower level, with the exception of Morquil. His cabin was next to\nthe one occupied by the Barrows. The McCarthys were on the opposite side\nof the passage, in a room slightly smaller than the one allotted to Dick\nand his wife.\n\nThe quarters of the remainder of the party were smaller, but still quite\ncomfortable; all located farther back on the same passage.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMorquil was proud of the ship, and displayed each section with pride. He\nopened every cupboard door, and showed them through all of the cabins.\nThey were stopped for a while, when they met Mrs. Yarbro, trying to\ndispel her fear of the strange craft. The others appeared to be taking\ntheir new quarters for granted, and settling down for the trip.\n\nThe main cabin was toward the front of the ship, while the dining room\nwas at the rear; the staterooms on the passage between. One stairway led\nto the lower level, from just back of the control room, another from the\ndining saloon. A ramp beneath the rear stairway led to the hold of the\nship. When they started down, Dolores returned to her cabin. Her\ninterest ended on the upper decks.\n\nDick spotted John, bending over one of the machines, so engrossed that\nhe didn't hear their approach. One of the crew stood nearby, watching.\n\nWhen McCarthy saw Barrow, he nearly burst with enthusiasm. \"This is the\ngreatest thing I've ever seen! Why, it almost _talks_! Do you know, this\nlittle machine actually picks up the orders from the control room, and\n_adjusts every machine down here_! Darned if I don't think it's got a\nbrain!\"\n\nWhen Morquil led the way toward the front of the hold, John was still\nengrossed in the apparatus. \"He will be a valuable man to you, Dick, and\ncan solve many problems that you would otherwise have to do yourself. He\nwill make an able assistant.\"\n\nPassing by the heavy machinery, they approached an enclosed section,\nwhich appeared to be of recent installation. Stepping through the\ndoorway, Morquil threw a switch which lighted every corner, then watched\nexpectantly as Dick examined the strange objects. It appeared to be a\ncolony of metal beehives, with covered passages between.\n\n\"It is our home, Dick. This room contains everything in miniature that\nyou will see when we arrive. Each of the smaller domes house thirty\nthousand people, the large one three times that number. We are born,\nlive our lives, and die beneath these metal ceilings. It will be your\njob to care for them.\n\n\"Everything beneath these domes is exactly as it is in our cities,\nexcept that the machines are dummies. This model room was installed so\nyou could study our civilization during the trip. When you arrive you\nwill be ready to start work.\n\n\"You, and you only will have a key. You may bring any member of your\nparty here that you desire, but it is not necessary for them to\nunderstand the entire civilization. There are only six cities, including\nthe large one, where you and John McCarthy will be located. The other\nmen will each have one dome under their control.\n\n\"It is easy to travel back and forth, and you may gather together at any\ntime, although each of you will have duties in different sections. While\nyou are overseeing the work in the smaller cities John can look after\nthe capital. Upon your arrival in Yorpun you will take complete charge\nof all mechanical work. It will be your responsibility from then on.\"\n\nAs Dick slipped the key in his pocket, he felt the weight of a country\nsettle slowly on his shoulders. Two hundred and ten thousand\npeople--entirely dependent upon _his_ control of the machines.\n\nWhere could this settlement be? They had sailed darn near to the end of\nthe world in the _Primrose_, and now they were going even farther. From\nthe way the metal domes covered the cities, it might be at the south\npole, and still be habitable.\n\nBy the time they returned to the main cabin, it was dinner time. It was\npast mid-day when he regained consciousness, and Dick was hungry.\n\nMrs. McCarthy was knitting a sweater for her husband, while three of the\nstrange men watched in amazement. Her knitting needles seemed to hold\nthem spellbound. The other members of Dick's party were sitting around\ntrying to decide what to do. But the sound of the dinner gong, made them\nforget their worries.\n\nDick had to go down to the hold and call John, who was still watching\nthe master machine. If he hadn't been dragged away, he would have spent\nthe night examining the strange device.\n\nThe meal was simple, but they all enjoyed it. It seemed to dispel the\ngloom from the party, and they appreciated McCarthy's jokes. There were\nfifteen of Morquil's race in the crew, and all but the men at the\ncontrols joined them.\n\nKnives and forks stood at the places set for the passengers, brought\nfrom the supplies on the _Primrose_, but the crew ate with long narrow\nspoons. Table silver was evidently unknown to this race of people.\n\nAfter dinner Morquil called them to the main cabin, and for the first\ntime told about the destination. All that had kept them from losing hope\nlong before, was his promise of greater comfort and luxury than they\ncould hope for in their native land.\n\n\"I know that some of you resent the fact that you were unconscious while\nput aboard this ship. But I know you would hesitate to come of your own\naccord. One woman said that she wouldn't go on an _undersea_ ship, and\nshe would be more afraid of this.\n\n\"You will be amazed to know that we are now leaving the atmosphere of\nthe earth that you have always known. _Our destination is on a different\nplanet!_\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n_Morquil's Story_\n\n\nFor a long time there was silence, then Mrs. Jones fainted. McCarthy\ntook it without flinching, and his wife was satisfied if he was. Dick\nhad suspected something almost as strange, and did not seem surprised.\nDolores looked at him for guidance. He nodded reassuringly. The others\nshut their lips tight, feeling that they had been taken prisoner without\nhope of escape.\n\nAfter a pause, Morquil continued. Mrs. Jones had recovered her composure\nand was staring at him with undisguised dislike. \"I'm sorry it had to\nhappen this way, but I would not have been able to take sufficient\npeople if you had known where we were going. Some of you might have\ncome, but I treated every one alike.\n\n\"I also was unconscious from the gas, but the crew revived me. I had to\nlook after the loading of the supplies, and have the cabins prepared for\nyou. It was much nicer that way than if you had resisted, and were put\non board by force.\n\n\"I shall start at the beginning of my story, and let you judge for\nyourselves as to whether we have done wrong.\n\n\"The existence of my world depends on the perfect operation of machines.\nEven our atmosphere is manufactured and kept at proper temperature\nwithin sealed domes, to protect us from the natural gases of the planet.\nWe live on this planet through necessity--_not desire_!\n\n\"Our race landed there very long ago after escaping from a planet that\nwas falling into the sun. Their space ship ran short of fuel within the\ngravity pull of our present habitation. It was difficult, but they\nsucceeded in constructing gas-proof shelters, and slowly improved\nconditions for living.\n\n\"We never knew what happened to the other space ships from our original\nplanet, but they may be distributed throughout the universe. Your _own_\nancestors may be of the same origin as ours. The similarity of our forms\ntends to prove it.\n\n\"Eventually metal domes were built, and the race prospered within. But\nour lives depend on their being kept in perfect repair. Machines were\nbuilt which do practically all of the work in caring for our wants, and\nfrom the first we have adjusted our own gravity; to live normally under\nthe gigantic pull of the new planet, which to you is Jupiter.\n\n\"Through the ages our lives became easier, and required less manual\nwork. Machinery did everything we desired. Most of them were\nautomatically repaired and serviced, while the permanent machines ran on\nthrough the ages without care. As generation after generation lived and\ndied, under these conditions, we lost most of our former knowledge.\n\n\"When one of the atmospheric machines ceased to operate--we _could not\nrepair it_! Instead, one of the other machines had to be speeded up, and\nthe atmosphere pumped into the extra dome.\n\n\"At the height of our mechanical development this space ship was built.\nThen the race lost interest and were content to live in ease, without\nattempting to reach another planet. Three generations ago our people\ndiscovered the danger. Even our bodies had deteriorated until we _could\nnot stand hard work_. The machines had begun to break down--we were\nheaded for extinction!\n\n\"When I was a young man they succeeded in finishing the equipment on\nthis ship. Three generations had been required to create enough fuel for\nonly _two voyages_!\n\n\"I was selected as the man to explore the strange world, which we had\nbeen studying with the instruments of our ancestors. We had determined\nyour exact mechanical development, and knew that you were capable of\nfurnishing the engineers which meant life or death to our race.\n\n\"It is twenty years since I was left on the small island, and the ship\nreturned to Jupiter. At that time we decided the date for this trip, to\nbring me back. In the meantime I traveled half way around the world in a\nsmall metal boat, before being picked up by a tramp steamer, as I dared\nnot land near any civilized country. After I reached a settlement I had\nto learn your customs and language, and many other things about a\ncompletely alien people.\n\n\"I was furnished with an ample supply of gold, as we knew it was the\nmetal that you valued highest. This purchased many things that would\notherwise have been impossible to obtain, and also brought me a great\ndeal of trouble. I was robbed of most of the wealth before I had been in\ncivilization a year. The fact that a great deal was left on the small\nisland is all that made my venture possible.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I spent three years in an institution before they decided that I was a\nnormal human being, and could take care of myself. I dared not tell them\nthat I came from a different planet, or I would have failed in every\nway. I learned many things about the people of your world, but mainly\nthat gold could buy almost anything.\n\n\"I lived for several years, by working at anything that I could obtain,\ntrying to find someone who would finance an expedition to the island. No\none would believe me when I said that I knew of a great fortune in gold.\nI finally found a man who _did_ believe me, and he received one half of\nthe gold as reward. It was not until then that I could begin the work\nthat I started out to do, and nearly ten years had passed.\n\n\"I planned for several years before I dared try to obtain the people I\nneeded. I studied everything I could about your engineering, and found\nthat it was not of the same type as our own. For this reason I did not\nwant a graduate engineer, as he would have to learn everything all over\nagain in my cities.\n\n\"When I advertised for men, and told you of the wonderful mechanical\ndevelopment, it was the truth. I did mislead you to a small extent, in\nobtaining your promise to come with me, but the existence of my race\ndepended on your work. My people will give you anything you desire if\nyou will help them.\n\n\"When we left our cities, we didn't know whether we could even escape\nfrom the planet in this ship. There was no opportunity of testing it,\nuntil we started on the journey. Even the men at the controls had never\nhandled it. All of their knowledge was obtained by years of practice,\nsitting in a stationary ship.\n\n\"When they left me on the island and returned to the planet, they\n_hoped_ I could accomplish my purpose, but the chance of success was\npitifully small.\n\n\"I have never enjoyed the comforts of other members of my race, but have\nspent my life in an alien universe, carrying around my big head; without\nfriends or companionship. The gravity within our enclosed cities is\nlower than on your planet, making it easy for us to walk.\n\n\"After several years of study and planning, I knew there was only one\nway of accomplishing what I went after. It is the way I have done it. No\none would have believed that I came from a strange planet; they would\nhave thought me out of my mind. If I _had_ persuaded them, I could have\nfound no recruits for the work, no matter what I offered. I _know_ how\nanyone feels about leaving their own planet, where they were born and\nbrought up.\n\n\"You will find that the machines need work badly. Some of them are\nrunning only because we use several times the normal power to turn them.\nOur mining machines have not worked for more than a generation, and the\nmines remain idle. The metal supply is running short.\n\n\"The equipment which overcomes gravity, also furnishes us with power.\nWhen weights are lifted, with gravity almost eliminated, then allowed to\nsink with the full pull of Jupiter, it creates enormous amounts of\nenergy for every use.\n\n\"It will be months before we reach our cities, and I hope that by that\ntime you will feel satisfied with your forced migration. To my race, it\nwas the only course which would avoid annihilation within a few\ngenerations.\n\n\"At first it will seem terrible to be shut in beneath a metal cover. But\nwhen you become accustomed to it, that feeling disappears. You depend\njust as much on a ship at sea or a plane in the air, but never think of\nit in the same way. We _must_ trust you, as we will not know whether you\nare repairing or destroying our machines until we see the results.\n\n\"You will be given complete power and can draw upon my people for all of\nthe help you need. You will be even more powerful than the rulers of the\ndomes. My people decided that you deserved this position, long before we\nattempted to reach the earth and bring you back.\n\n\"I came to your country because the mechanical development is greater\nthan in any other nation. You have greater love for engineering, and\nmore of you are employed that way.\n\n\"I have told you everything about my home and my people, and leave it up\nto you as to the way you will act. We have only done what was necessary\nfor the survival of our race, and hope that you will forgive us for\nstealing you from your own planet.\n\n\"You have complete freedom of the ship, to come and go as you please at\nany time. You are now considered part of our own population, and we both\nhave the same interests. We hope you enjoy it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a moment Morquil gazed into the faces of the small gathering of\npeople, then slowly walked from the room. There was complete silence,\nbroken occasionally by a sigh as some thought of home exerted itself. An\nhour passed and they still had not moved. Each seemed to be waiting for\none of the others to break the silence.\n\nFinally Dick got to his feet. His words came slow, as if carefully\nweighed before using; the others listened intently.\n\n\"I know what each of you must be thinking; because I've been thinking\nthe same thoughts. We are all in the same boat, without chance of\nleaving--headed for _Jupiter_! We have seen the last of the world where\nwe were born. Either we take up our lives in this new existence, or die\nout here in space--destroying Morquil's race as well as ourselves.\n\n\"He says they can not survive without our aid. Our own world did not\nneed us, or give us much for our efforts. If it had we would not be on\nthis strange space ship. Morquil hired only people who were willing to\nleave their homes and friends--and we _applied_ for the work. There\nreally is not much that we can complain about.\n\n\"For one, I intend to do all that I can to make our future home the\ngreatest civilization in the universe. Perhaps in the future years it\nwill be possible for us to pay a short visit to our former planet.\nPerhaps our children will follow in our footsteps; enjoying greater\nhonor, comfort, and luxury than they could possibly have had in our own\nworld. I received little from my fellow men, and have _already_ received\nmore from Morquil than I ever had before.\"\n\nAs Dick sat down, John McCarthy's voice boomed out. \"I'll follow Dick!\nHe's the boss of this party, and if he's satisfied, I am. _Boy!_ We sure\ndo go places when we get started!\"\n\nThe general laugh broke the tension, and each one spoke after a little\nhesitation. Each man slowly grasped the gigantic task that was facing\nthem, and felt honored as a result.\n\nIt was a new world, farther advanced than their former habitation--which\nneeded _them_ to care for it. It was a big bite to chew--but they would\ndo it!\n\nDick remained in his chair long after the others had gone to their\ncabins. His mind dwelled on the complete happiness and satisfaction that\nlighted Morquil's face, when informed of their decision. In that moment\nhe was repaid for a lifetime in a strange world, amongst alien people.\nHis return to Jupiter would be triumphal, with the earth people as his\nfriends; come to save his race from extinction!\n\nBarrow's mind wandered on, to the gigantic task that faced them. His\nwould be the greatest responsibility, as head of all the domes. The\nother men would have a single city to care for. The thought of McCarthy\nas his assistant was comforting; he would be a great help.\n\nThe strange race of beings were putting every trust in the\nearthmen--putting themselves at the mercy of the seven strangers--and\nDick knew the men would _earn_ that faith!\n\nHe jumped when a hand touched his shoulder.\n\n\"Dick, won't you take your wife to her room--she feels sleepy!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n_Voyaging to Another World_\n\n\nDuring each waking period, Barrow spent many hours in the room with the\nminiature domes. They were beautiful models, which could be opened or\nmoved as desired, by small levers on the foundation. Wires as fine as\nhairs were strung from one spot to another, while metal the size of\nthread represented heavy cables.\n\nSlowly, an understanding of the strange civilization formed in Dick's\nmind, and he drew sectional maps of the location of all mechanical\nequipment. Other maps pictured the streets, so that it would be easy to\nreach any desired destination. When this was done, Morquil sent one of\nhis men down to make as many copies as desired. Each engineer was to\nhave a complete set.\n\nThe earthmen had learned to keep track of the time according to the\nsystem on the ship. Each \"lix\" included the time spent in sleep as well\nas one waking period. It was twenty-seven hours in length, but they all\nthought of it as a day.\n\nEach lix was divided into thirty-six \"migs.\" Each mig being just\nforty-five minutes in length. They were able to keep track of each mig,\nby their watches, although the time pieces were useless for any other\npurpose.\n\nOne lix, Dick returned the friendly smile of a member of the crew, and\nto his amazement the man spoke. \"Chickiboo.\" For a moment Barrow was\nstumped, then realized that it must be a greeting.\n\nWhen he was greeted the same way, by a second and then a third man, he\ntried to imitate the words. The man from Jupiter was so pleased that he\nalmost danced, then spoke again. \"Gootmording.\"\n\nDick's jaw almost dropped open; the man was trying to speak _English_!\n\nSuddenly Barrow laughed. Morquil had been instructing his crew in the\nstrange language, as well as telling them to greet the earthmen in their\nown tongue. He must speak about holding classes to learn the language.\nThey would have to understand it, and the sooner they started the easier\nit would be.\n\nThe following lix, Dick stopped on the ramp to the machinery hold to\nlisten. McCarthy was humming the tune of a song that had been the rage\nat home, but the words were \"chicki-boo--chicki-boo--chicki-boo.\"\n\nBarrow smiled as he approached, but the big Irishman didn't realize the\nreason. He was almost bursting with news.\n\n\"I've got it, Dick! I've found the key! Don't laugh, but I've discovered\nthe working principle of this little machine, and it will lead to the\nsecret of all others. In a month I'll know how this crate runs.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, I'm not laughing, John. I think it's great that you've got\nthis far. I only wish the others would show as much interest. Not one of\nthem has been down here for more than a few minutes, and they know\nlittle more than when we started.\"\n\n\"Aw! Don't take it that way, Dick. It isn't their fault. Didn't you ever\nsee their _wives_? Those women won't let the men out of their sight for\nthree minutes. Your wife and mine are different--they _trust_ us! If we\ntell 'em the ship's okay, it's okay; but _them_--say, they can't tell\ntheir wives anything. The women in their families do _all_ of the\ntalking.\"\n\nDick laughed, but knew that it was close to the truth. The other men in\nthe party _were_ tied to their wives' apron strings. Aside from Dolores\nand Eileen McCarthy, none of the women trusted the space ship. They were\nafraid it might fly to pieces at any moment, although they had overcome\ntheir fear enough to find means of entertainment.\n\nSmall devices in the cabin showed miniature movies, with words in the\ntongue of the dome cities. Discovering this created desire to understand\nthe language, and they eagerly attended the classes.\n\nOne lix Dick found Jerold Brown examining a piece of machinery. A few\nlix later Andrew Smith had joined him. Soon every earthman was spending\nhis time in the machinery hold, with McCarthy acting as instructor. He\nwould accept no excuse for being late at his classes--and they all\narrived on time!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWeeks slipped by as the ship drove on through space. The earthmen\nlearned to admire the men from Jupiter for their constant good-nature,\nalthough they were slightly childish.\n\nThe crew of engineers were slowly learning the rudiments of Jupiter's\nscience. Barrow through his study of the domes, and McCarthy through\nstudy of the machines, far surpassed the others. At times both men spent\nhours in the model room, at others Dick examined the machines beside the\nIrishman. They compared notes until each knew the other's findings.\n\nDick took all the men into the model room once every third lix, and\nspent four hours instructing them in the civilization. Each man had his\nown set of maps, and marked down facts about his future location. Dick\ncopied their notes on a large map, that covered all the cities. They\nused numbers to signify different mechanisms, to make it easier to\ndescribe equipment that was duplicated in more than one dome.\n\nIn a month they were able to carry on light conversation, and from then\non mastery of the language was faster. The women far surpassed the men,\ndue to desire for entertainment.\n\nWhen he was able to question the crew, Dick received a terrible shock.\n_They knew less about the ship's operation than his own men!_ They\ndidn't understand their own equipment!\n\nThe people of the domes were content to enjoy the mechanical wonders of\ntheir ancestors--without bothering about how they ran. They used\nequipment for every purpose, without the slightest interest in why it\nworked. The earthmen suddenly realized what a gigantic task they faced.\n_Seven men_--to rebuild a civilization!\n\nThe men at the controls knew what reaction would take place by movement\nof a lever, but _didn't understand why_! Dick became slightly worried\nabout reaching their destination--it was beyond all reason. Earthmen\nwouldn't have attempted to operate equipment they knew nothing about, by\nmovement of controls to obtain the proper action.\n\nIt was no wonder these people had found it necessary to find engineers\nto run their machines!\n\nMonths slipped by as the ship moved steadily toward the giant planet.\nEvery piece of equipment seemed to be the answer to perfection. This\nvoyage had taught them more about mechanics than was covered in a\ncomplete engineering course on earth. It was of a far different kind,\nwith gravity the basis of all operation. Even the space ship employed\nsome of the same power, drawn from the nearest heavy body, then\namplified until it reached enormous proportions.[1]\n\nPeter Yarbro was a practical chemist, and spent many hours trying to\nanalyze the fuel. It was highly inflammable, yet could stand terrific\ncompression without effect. When it was allowed to expand again, it\nreached the flash point immediately, creating enormous amounts of heavy\ngas. He believed it might be duplicated from crude oil, properly\nrefined.\n\nWhen Dick learned that there was a history of the space ship, in the\nmetal books, his curiosity was aroused. He could read the language of\nthe domes slightly, but not enough to study the intricate explanations.\nIt was through these books that the dome men had learned to control the\nship, and set the course for any desired planet.\n\nMorquil's aid was enlisted, to translate the text, and he learned some\namazing facts. A description of the fuel was given, but the base for\nmanufacture was unknown, being of natural origin on Jupiter. As Morquil\nread farther and explained sections that Dick couldn't understand, the\nearthman felt uneasy.\n\nThe crew had abandoned all hope of returning to their home planet, the\nfirst time they started from the earth. They didn't understand what it\nmeant to feel responsible for equipment. They manufactured enough fuel\nfor two trips, according to the rating of consumption in the books--but\nDick wondered?\n\nThe tanks were filled to capacity before the first trip, and hadn't been\ntested since. The happy dome people didn't consider that their ancestors\nmight have been mistaken, or that actual operation might vary from the\noriginal plan.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor the first time in twenty years, the gauges were examined. Barrow and\nMcCarthy crawled through the dust-coated passage beneath the floor of\nthe machinery hold. They found a light switch, but the bulbs were so\ndust-coated that only a faint glow shed on the surrounding metal. They\nsneezed and coughed, as the dust-laden air filled their lungs.\n\n\"Darned if you don't get the craziest ideas, Dick. What good will it do\nto know how much 'ship juice' there is, anyway? We can't _make_ it! This\nhole wasn't built for self-respecting men to crawl through.\"\n\n\"I don't know, John, but this trip may not be as easy as it appears.\nThey've been driving at full force for months, when it seems to me that\nless power might carry us when we're not within the pull of some planet.\nI want to make _sure_ that there's plenty of fuel. According to the\nbooks, the designers didn't expect the ship to be driven this hard.\"\n\nJohn did a little cussing when they located the gauges, and found them\nso thick with grime that they had to be cleaned. He headed back through\nthe dust for a cloth, with Dick's laugh following. \"Alright, alright,\nbut don't rub it in. Just because you happened to be in front of me, and\nthere isn't room to pass, don't give you the right to laugh. Some day\nyou'll be eating your share of dust, and will _I_ laugh! I bet that the\ndomes are _all_ a mess.\"\n\nDick wrote down the reading of each gauge, as John cleaned the surfaces.\nHe couldn't understand the strange numerals, and had to go over them\nwith Morquil. Both men breathed a sigh of relief as they crawled back\nthrough the floor of the hold, and dropped the trap door in place.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAn hour later Dick began to worry. According to Morquil, the tanks were\n_less than one-eighth full_. The big-headed man had gone over the\nfigures twice, and was showing signs of agitation as he checked them\nagain at Barrow's request. When he glanced up, Dick knew there was no\nmistake.\n\n\"The fuel _is_ low Dick. According to the other trip, the greatest use\nof power is at the time we approach the planet, to fight the pull of\ngravity. Our trip from earth is only half completed, with the greatest\nneed of fuel still ahead. You must think my race very stupid not to have\nthought of it?\"\n\nIt took Dick a long time to answer. His mind was searching frantically\nfor some solution. It was useless to ask help of the crew--they\ncouldn't even _think_ scientifically!\n\n\"No, Morquil. I don't think you're stupid, but I do consider your people\nvery foolish. From the appearance of things _we will never reach the\ndomes_!\n\n\"Unless something drastic is accomplished, the ship will smash to pieces\non your planet. You don't know _anything_ about the ship's operation,\nand we've only studied it for a short time.\"\n\nThey decided to inform the men immediately but say nothing to the women\nfor the present. Within an hour of the discovery, Morquil warned the men\nat the controls to conserve the power as much as possible.\n\nEvery operation of the ship, was dependent on fuel. The generators for\nheat, light and controls, were turned by discharge through the tubes. At\nleast _one_ blast must be fired at _all times_ to keep the controls\nsensitized, and develop power for emergency equipment. The other tubes\nwere silenced.\n\nDuring the rest migs Dick couldn't sleep, but spent every minute talking\nto John McCarthy. There _must_ be some solution--_and they had to find\nit_!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n_An Engineer's Mettle_\n\n\nIn the morning the earthmen were called together. They came with smiling\nfaces, which slowly changed to apprehension.\n\nThere were many suggestions in as many minutes, but none that gave a\npossibility of accomplishing the impossible. They had to stretch the\nfuel--_without visible means of stretching it_!\n\nThe women believed the meeting was a routine course in mechanics, and\nwent on enjoying their entertainment. The men explained they were\nbothered by a knotty question about the machinery to account for their\nworried concentration. It would have been a terrible handicap if the\nwomen discovered the truth.\n\nThree lix passed with little change. The fuel had been cut down for a\nwhile, but the ship didn't hold its course. Every tube had been fired to\nhold the direct route for Jupiter. They were constantly cutting into the\nmeager supply that remained--_and had to overcome the deficiency_!\n\nDue to the slight conservation of fuel the ship had been operating far\nbelow efficiency, and the cold of space began to seep through the walls.\nThis affected the dome people more than the earthmen, and they suffered\ntorture. Any change in temperature was unknown to them, they were\nchilled at a few degrees below normal heat.\n\nSuddenly, during dinner on the third evening, Peter Yarbro jumped up\nfrom the table. The other men fastened eager eyes on his face, while the\nwomen watched in amazement.\n\nHe started to speak, then remembered the women, sat down quietly. \"I--I\nthink I've found the answer--to our _problem_! If you will join me in\nthe hold, when we finish eating, I would like to talk it over with you.\"\n\nMrs. Yarbro was even more amazed. \"Peter! I'm surprised at you. Jumping\nup from the table so excited, just because you happened to think of the\nanswer to a _problem_! You ought to be ashamed.\"\n\nIn spite of his worries Dick lowered his head to hide the smile. If only\nPeter's wife knew what that problem was, she might not think it so\nstrange.\n\nHardly a man touched his food, and as soon as they were out of earshot\nof the women, he spoke what was in his mind. The crew heard him at the\ntable and many of them gathered to listen. For the first time in their\nlives they were worried. Their lives depended on the earthmen before\nthey even _reached_ their planet.\n\nYarbro hesitated. \"I'm not so sure now, that I _have_ found the answer.\nWhen it came to me, I thought it was simple, but now it seems more like\na dream.\n\n\"Since knowing that the fuel was low I've racked my brain for something\nthat might be used--and it had to be on the ship. Every _other_ man was\nlooking for a mechanical answer, and my efforts would be of little use.\nSo I've searched for a chemical.\n\n\"_Water_ is the only liquid in any quantity. I discarded it so many\ntimes that it left a headache, but my search always came back to the\nsame place. It's the only thing we've got.\n\n\"All other liquids are in too small amounts, even if they could be used,\nand the ship is equipped only for chemical fuel--_in liquid form_!\n\n\"At dinner when I became so excited, I thought that water would do the\ntrick. Now I don't know. It has oxygen in large amounts, which is\nvitally needed, but that's the only advantage.\n\n\"Even if we dared try, it might injure the tubes. Still I believe it's\nthe only chance of salvation. It's the one substance on board, in any\nlarge quantity. What do you think?\"\n\nThere wasn't a sound as the minutes passed. Each man searched\nfrantically for the slightest hope; searched for the _one_ chance in a\nthousand!\n\nDick finally broke the silence. \"What is _your_ plan, Peter? You must\nhave thought of something?\"\n\n\"No, that's just the trouble. I thought that water might mix with the\nfuel, even fire with it. It was only a brain storm I'm afraid.\"\n\nAfter a moment Dick spoke again. \"It _can't_ be! Since there is no other\nsubstance--_we must use water_! There has to be a way--and _we've got to\nfind it_! We might as well use up the water and die of thirst, as to\ndrift around in space until we starve to death, or die in the dive at\nJupiter.\"\n\nTwice Mrs. Martin came down the ramp to take her husband to bed, but\nDick sent her away. The men would stay there until they had found a\nsolution--_they had to_! The fuel was fast disappearing!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMorquil still sat in the background. The other men from Jupiter had gone\nto their quarters. He could offer no suggestion, but listened carefully\nto every word they spoke. Finally he stood up.\n\n\"I hope that you can forgive me. In the last three lixs I have regretted\nthat I ever saw your earth. It were better that my people die, than for\nus to carry people from a happy planet to die in space--because of our\nstupidity. We are no better than children without cares or worries. The\nmen of the crew realized the risk, before they left the domes--but it is\nnot your fault!\"\n\n\"Aw, sit down you big-headed numbskull!\" McCarthy's voice boomed out.\n\"We don't blame _you_! We'll find some way to run this crate, and get\nthere in one piece. You just made us go to work before we expected. Why!\nA problem like this is _simple_ on earth--they'd solve it in _no_ time!\nYou just go to bed and stop worrying. We'll have everything fixed by\nmorning.\"\n\nMorquil's expression changed slightly, and he almost smiled. He started\nfor the ramp as if taking the words literally, but half way up he faced\nthe little gathering again. \"Thank you, John. But I haven't forgotten\nthat you were a famous liar in your home town--and you haven't lost your\nability. Thank you anyway, you're very kind.\"\n\nWhen McCarthy turned toward the others, he looked rather sheepish. But\nthe forced smiles he received made him feel a lot better.\n\nHours passed, while each man told everything he had known about water.\nAt last Dick stood up. \"We've covered every possible reaction, and many\nthat are seemingly impossible, but have overlooked one very vital point\nthat will either help or hinder greatly.\n\n\"The fuel is subjected to terrific pressure. Naturally, any water that\nwas used would receive the same treatment. In the compression chamber\nthe pressure rises very fast, which must develop high temperature. The\nresult is that we would not have water--_we'd have steam_! It would be\nalmost _dry steam_!\n\n\"Water in the liquid form couldn't discharge oxygen fast enough to\naffect the fuel, but as steam it might. There is a good chance that\nsteam may even _increase_ the explosive power to a point that we can't\neven imagine. There's only one way to find out--_try it_!\n\n\"Every man here will admit that John has the most practical mechanical\nbrain. It will be his job to find a means of injecting the water in the\nproper amounts. The rest of us can try to find any kinks in the system\nthat he suggests. He knows every piece of equipment on board, and can\npick whatever is best suited for the purpose.\"\n\nAs Dick sat down, John got to his feet. \"This is one time that I'm ahead\nof you. While you've been talking I've been planning a way to do just\nthat. There's an extra firing tube that can hold the pressure we want.\n\n\"Fuel for all the blasts is compressed in one chamber, then discharged\nthrough any desired tube. If we put the water under the pressure, with\nthe hydraulic system, and let it seep into the chamber at a set\nrate--_it might work_! Valves can control the steam perfectly, and\nregulate the flow to whatever is desired.\n\n\"The tube will have to be shut off from the fuel tank every few hours,\nto be filled. Preheating the water will develop steam pressure, and it\nwon't draw enough from the hydraulic system to affect the operation of\nthe blasts.\n\n\"What do you say, shall we try it? It means shutting off all but the\nemergency tube for several hours, and it will be _cold_!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWithin five minutes they were hauling the heavy tube from the storage\nroom. In an hour everything was ready to assemble, and each man knew\nexactly what work he was to do. A pipe line was run from the water\ntanks, to fill the steam chamber in position.\n\nDick was building an electric heating unit to encase the entire tube,\nwhich could be regulated for any desired temperature.\n\nHalf of the rest period had passed when the chamber was finished and\nthey were ready to cut an opening in the compression unit. Perspiration\npoured down the body of every man, but not from the exertion. Each\nminute that passed ate deeper into the fuel. If water couldn't replace\nthe liquid, they were helpless.\n\nThey wanted to install the tube, while the women were asleep. The ship\nwould be too cold for comfort for a long time after the blasts could be\nstarted again. When the heating units in the hull were shut off it would\nbecome freezing inside.\n\nMen raced through the ship, stopping at their staterooms on the way.\nDick dropped three extra covers over Dolores without disturbing her,\nthen slipped into the heaviest clothing that he owned.\n\nEach man was occupied in his own room, in the same way. Heavy coats were\ntaken to the men at the controls while the remainder of the crew were\nsent to a room with an emergency heating unit.\n\nIn fifteen minutes they were back at the compression chamber, and at the\ntouch of a button the blasts were silenced from the control room.\n\nBy the time an opening was cut in the heavy tanks, the cold had begun to\ncreep into the ship. The men worked desperately, and for a while\nperspiration dampened their clothing. Then the chill crept deeper--and\nthey shivered. Their fingers grew numb, and they had to warm them over\na small electric unit, but the opening slowly enlarged beneath their\ntorches.\n\nWhen the tube was fitted into the hole, and the metal began to flow\naround the edges, even the torches seemed to throw little heat. Dick\nknew his nose was frosted, and warned the others not to touch their nose\nor ears. According to John's watch it required three hours to fit the\ntube in place.\n\nWhen they rang for the power to be turned on, they waited in vain. When\nminutes passed without reaction, they glanced at each other in\nconsternation. Brown and Martin raced up the ramp while the others\nwaited. Within a few minutes the tubes began to fire and warmth slowly\ndrove back the numbing cold.\n\nWater pipes had burst, and they hurried to stop the leaks. The main\ntanks were uninjured, as the cold hadn't penetrated the big supplies in\nstorage.\n\nDick suddenly realized that Brown and Martin hadn't returned. When he\nreached the upper deck all of the women were gathered near the room\nwhere the crew had been left. The thermometer was only fifty degrees,\neven then, and they shivered in heavy coats.\n\nEvery dome man was stretched out on the floor! As Dick stepped within,\nhis heart almost stopped beating--but they were only unconscious! His\nbreath escaped in a long sigh, after holding it for almost a minute.\n\nBrown and Martin were trying to revive the prone forms. The control men\nlay beside the others, brought there by the two earthmen. The eyes of\nfirst one then another, slowly opened, and they looked around in\namazement. Cold affected them like an anaesthetic, causing complete\nunconsciousness.\n\nWhen the ship reached normal warmth, they felt as good as ever. It\nhadn't been cold enough to freeze them, in their section, and not a man\nwas injured. When they understood what happened, the men hurried back to\nthe controls.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe heavy coils were soon fastened around the tube, and it was filled\nthrough a valve on the upper side. A gauge was set to register the\npressure of the vapor within. They decided to raise steam pressure\nenough to equal the compression of the fuel.\n\nIt required fifteen minutes for the water to reach the boiling point,\nwhile they nervously held their watches. They could keep track of\nminutes and hours, although there was no longer day and night in their\nlives. According to their figures, they now ate dinner at three o'clock\nin the morning, and went to bed in the early afternoon.\n\nThey held their breath when the steam valve was opened. It moved slowly\nunder Dick's fingers, while a thousand questions raced through every\nmind.\n\n\"Would it silence the blasts? Would it put them out of commission\npermanently? Was that moment, and the turning of that valve, the end of\nexistence for them all?\"\n\nDick glanced at the gauge on the tube, then jerked the valve shut. The\npressure was still far below that of the fuel. He turned the heating\nunit on full, and watched the gauge climb higher. They didn't understand\nthe numerals of the domed cities, but knew the pressure was getting\nterrifically high.\n\nWhen he opened the valve again, the steam gauge _did not rise_! It held\nalmost steady. The hiss of escaping steam, sounded through the heavy\nmetal faintly.\n\nThe tubes began to fire spasmodically! Dick bit his lips, as he opened\nthe valve a little wider. John McCarthy wiped the sweat from his\nforehead, as every face turned white as chalk.\n\n_They fired evenly again!!!_ The steam was working through the\nmixture--_discharging through the blasts_!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey felt their bodies sway under the effects of acceleration and\nexultance filled them. There was _some_ reaction, at least!\n\nMorquil appeared on the ramp, his face lighted by a smile. \"_What have\nyou done?_ The ship is traveling at _almost twice the speed that it was\nbefore_! Is it all right?\"\n\nDick sat down hard. Not a man in the crowd was able to answer. Success\nhad left them speechless. Barrow was the first to recover his voice.\n\n\"Are you _sure_?\"\n\n\"Yes, Dick! We took three separate observations, and each showed the\nsame result--almost _double_ normal speed! Does it mean what you wanted?\n_Can we reach the domes?_\"\n\n\"I hope so, Morquil. If the steam has made _that_ much difference, we'll\nget there without trouble. The water must be conserved as much as\npossible--and hope that it lasts. Whether it increases the power of the\nfuel, or simply creates an additional body to drive against, is not\nimportant. _We're getting there!_\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n_Jupiter and Trouble!_\n\n\nThe huge ship circled the planet twice, with the instruments adjusted to\ndetect the metal of the domes. They spread over many miles of the\nsurface, yet were like grains of sand on the enormous globe. When the\ngauges quivered over a section, hidden beneath the mists, every one\nbreathed a sigh of relief.\n\nIt would be many hours before the ship was within the cities, but they\nwere _home_! Every earthman had the same feeling. Jupiter was almost as\nmuch of a home to them as to the natives, even before they had seen it.\nThey eagerly looked forward to sight of the domes that would be under\ntheir care.\n\nJohn McCarthy entered the control room with a big tray of containers.\n\"Here! It's not liquor, but I'll bet you enjoy it more. There's enough\nin each of these to _really_ quench your thirst. I for one, will enjoy\ndrinking all of the water I want, after five weeks on short rations.\"\n\nIt seemed impossible that the clouds outside could be deadly. They were\nbeautiful in the reflected light of the sun, yet those vapors contained\npoison that no man could live in. The domes were the only place that\nlife could exist on the strange planet.\n\nAs they dropped through the heavy mists, it created a feeling of dense\nfog. They could see nothing of the surroundings, trusting entirely on\nthe instruments. It was like groping in the dark, yet the earthmen knew\nit had been done before, and the dome men showed no fear.\n\nWhen a slight jar shook the ship, they breathed easier. _It had touched\nthe ground!_ They could feel some effect of the heavy gravity, even\nwithin the insulated hull. The ship slanted down at a steep angle,\nsliding forward with its own weight.\n\nThe earthmen didn't understand what was happening, but watched the\nactions of the dome men. They were using a different control board now,\nbeneath the other panel. McCarthy was down in the hold, watching the\naction of machines that had been idle until now.\n\nWhen they stopped, the mists disappeared from around them. Lights above\noutlined a huge metal passage. The ship started forward again and heavy\ndoors slid back at the approach with bright light appearing beyond.\n\nThey were looking across sun-lit country; the most perfect scene they\nhad ever witnessed. Strange trees, and growth of every description,\nspread in every direction. When the ship slid into the open, they were\nbeneath one of the domes--enormous beyond their greatest imagination,\nand exquisitely beautiful.\n\nWhile they watched spellbound, people started across the fields to greet\nthe expedition. The women were well proportioned, and far different from\nthe men of the race. Not as tall as the women of earth, or quite as well\nbuilt, but their heads were much smaller than the men's.\n\nAll men were dressed in flowing robes, the women in much less clothing.\nThey wore tight-fitting garments, like bathing suits of metallic cloth.\nThey were happy and carefree, seemingly without a worry in their lives.\nChildren came romping across the fields beside their parents.\n\nMinutes, slipped by, and the people from earth hadn't moved. Sight of\ntheir new home was too wonderful to grasp at once. Instead of the gloomy\nmetal covering they had expected, the curved surface above was finished\nin blue that resembled clear sky at home--as if they had reached the\nland of their dreams.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen their minds snapped back to reality, the dome men were being\nwelcomed by friends and relatives. The babble of voices came faintly to\nthe control room, from the power hull.\n\nJohn McCarthy joined them. When the machines stopped, he came up to find\nthe reason. Now the others watched as he gazed at the beautiful scene\nfor the first time. Their own amazement was reflected in his eyes. When\nhe looked up at the curved dome, his wife slipped her arm around him.\n\nThey were disturbed by the crew, returning with their friends to welcome\nthe engineers. The dome people seemed completely happy. They were like\nchildren greeting their parents, holding the hands of the earth people\nand gazing into their faces with adoration. In their minds, the future\nwas secure, and they no longer had a care in the world. Eileen McCarthy\nwas so overwhelmed at the reception that she hugged two of the little\nwomen.\n\nIt was like a dream to walk across the heavy carpet of moss. There was\nno grass, but the velvet coat of green was quite similar. The trees were\nshaped like an inverted bowl, their branches conforming to the curve of\nthe dome above. They were smaller than the trees of earth, with very\nlarge leaves.\n\nThe eyes of the earth people kept returning to the dome. It was hard to\nbelieve that it was not blue sky, except for giant supports that reached\nfrom the ground to the metal ceiling, hundreds of feet above.\n\nWhen Peter Yarbro learned that he was in charge of this agricultural\ndome, his pleasure knew no bounds. His wife couldn't wait to see the\nhome that had been prepared for them--and waiting almost twenty years.\n\nA circle of buildings formed the foundation of the immense metal\nceiling, as well as housing thousands of inhabitants. The back walls of\nthe structures were always blank, toward the vapor beyond the miniature\ncivilization. Each city was a world of its own, with a curved horizon at\nthe top of the buildings.\n\nIn Yarbro's dome there were few means of travel, as every inch of soil\nwas cultivated. The dome dwellers were past masters at farming, and\nloved this work more than any other type of labor. To them, it was a\npleasure that vied with amusement machines of other cities.\n\nWhen Mrs. Yarbro entered her new apartment, thirty stories above the\nground, and stepped to one of the balconies, the view was superb. She\nwas not interested in the next dome, but wanted to settle her own domain\nas soon as possible; completely happy.\n\nThe rest of the party entered an open car, mounted on a single track,\nand started for the next city. Every object that moved was operated by\nthe control of gravity, and could develop enormous speed and power. It\nrolled swiftly across the open ground, to enter a tunnel three hundred\nfeet wide, which carried all of the commerce between the cities. When it\nemerged in the next dome, the imitation sky was the same, but only a\nsmall portion of the ground surface was cultivated.\n\nSmall buildings dotted the level floor, which Morquil explained were the\nentrances of the mines, unworked for many years. Jerold Brown and his\nwife remained in this city, in an apartment as well situated as that of\nthe Yarbro's, in the first dome.\n\nHours passed as they moved from city to city. When they reached the\ncapitol, only the Barrows, McCarthys and Martins remained of the\noriginal fourteen. The others were in their own domes, settling down to\nthe new existence.\n\nEvery occupation seemed to have been forgotten by the childish people,\nto come and welcome the beings from another planet. They lined every\ninch of the way, many deep.\n\nThe main dome was three times the size of the others. Supporting\npillars, one hundred feet in diameter, seemed vague where they touched\nthe ceiling above. Parks covered most of the ground, dotted here and\nthere by amusement buildings and theaters.\n\nCars whizzed back and forth, as people gathered to see the strangers.\nFor the first time in generations the amusement buildings were deserted.\nSince their arrival, Dick had seen no sign of work, and finally\nquestioned Morquil.\n\n\"The people work one mig out of each lix, Dick. It is enough to carry on\ncultivation of the crops, and keep the amusement buildings running\nproperly and efficiently.\"\n\nBarrow was stunned. The working period would have to be increased to\nthree immediately, then four and five. They seemed to think that\nbringing men from another world would do the work, and were apt to be\ndisappointed when he started issuing orders.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Dick and his wife were installed in their new home, and the\nMcCarthys settled in a nearby apartment, Morquil hesitated. The Martins\nwere anxious to see their own habitation, and looked at the dome man\nquestioningly.\n\nHe finally spoke with hesitation. \"I have bad news for you. The Martins\nwill have to occupy an apartment in this city for a while. Their dome is\nout of order. Trouble developed soon after the ship left here, on this\ntrip, and over a thousand people were killed. Every other city is\novercrowded with refugees.\n\n\"It started with a strange banging on top of the dome, which kept\nincreasing. No one knew what the trouble was or how to stop it, so they\nwaited to see what happened. It didn't sound as if the ceiling was going\nto fall--but as if the banging came from _outside_! It was several migs\nbefore they knew the cause.\n\n\"When a large section crashed to the ground, it was a complete surprise,\nand caught the inhabitants unprepared. Soon the air was mixing with the\npoison gases from outside. People tried to escape, and most of them did.\nAll except those that fell unconscious from the gas.\n\n\"Before the last of them reached the tunnel, green things dropped to the\nground, and started after those who remained. They had to close the\ndoors between the cities to keep the creatures from entering this dome.\nIt is the first time that anything has happened to my people, and we\ndon't know what it could be.\"\n\nFor a long time the earthmen remained silent. The troubles of this\ncivilization had been dumped into their laps already--in the form of a\nterrible calamity. It sounded _almost_ as if some kind of life forms had\nbroken through the domes _from the outside_! Perhaps there was more\ndanger than could be imagined. One dome had been injured, if not\ndestroyed, and others might follow!\n\nA meeting of the earthmen was called immediately, much to their\nsurprise. Dick dared not let conditions stay as they were, for fear of\nfuture trouble. Action must be taken at once.\n\n\"We don't know what we're facing, but the fate of the race as well as\nour own lives, seem to be in danger. The break in the dome might have\nbeen accident, and the moving forms the imagination of fear. But we know\nthat over a thousand people were killed--whatever caused the trouble!\"\n\nThe men went back to their domes to rest, and plan some means of\nentering the deserted city, but were disturbed before they had time for\nsleep.\n\n_The agricultural dome had been attacked!_ The pounding had begun within\na short time of their arrival.\n\nOne thing was certain, the injured dome had been _attacked_! It was not\naccident that the metal ceiling fell. _There were living beings in the\ngases outside their civilization!_\n\nThe first dome had been attacked just after the space ship left for the\nearth, and this attack came just after its return to the domes. There\nwas little doubt that movement of the ship had disturbed the serenity of\nexistence. Perhaps the gas creatures hadn't known what was beneath the\nmetal hives until the ship appeared.\n\nThe banging on the agricultural dome, _had to be stopped_! A hole would\nlet in the gas! Rifles, that had been brought back on the ship as\ncuriosities, were given to each earthman. They loaded them carefully\nwhile they searched for some means of reaching the trouble.\n\nWhen the leader of the dome heard what they were planning, he showed\nthem sealed openings to a space between the sections of metal, which\nhadn't been used since the city was built. The dome was constructed in\nthree layers, for insulation, and to give added protection. It was like\na maze, to work their way toward the pounding through the network of\nstruts. At times they had to crawl on their hands and knees, at others\nthere were clearly defined passages.\n\nThey were afraid, and not ashamed to show it. They were hunting\ncreatures which they knew nothing about--didn't even know whether\nbullets would affect them! They might face thinking beings, or forms of\nlife that only wanted to search in the domes for food. It was not a\npleasant thought.\n\nEvery rifle was cocked as they neared the source of the pounding. Every\nnerve drawn to the finest point.\n\nSuddenly Dick stopped. He was ahead of the others and first to glimpse\nwhat they faced. He motioned to use the oxygen masks, as he fastened his\nown in place.\n\nAs they crept closer, light glinted on the giant pointed hammer,\noperated from beyond the outer layer of metal. It rose and fell at even\nintervals, through the rent in the upper surface. The ram had already\ncrushed through two thicknesses of metal, and was battering at the inner\nlayer.\n\nThe inside section was more like glass than metal and dim light passed\nthrough, but the outer layers were opaque. When the huge ram disappeared\nfrom the glow of light it left a gaping hole where it had been. It was\nof material they had never seen and glistened with a brownish hue. It\nappeared to shorten and expand in diameter, each time it struck the\nsurface.\n\nFor a moment they hesitated, trying to decide the best means of attack.\nWhatever animated the ram was above their vision, and they had to be\nclose to the opening to see it.\n\nEach time the shiny object descended, the dome vibrated beneath their\nfeet. As long as the vibration remained they were safe, but when it felt\nlike a thud--the metal would be cracking!\n\nThousands of helpless people were depending on the action of earthmen,\nfor their future existence. They seemed to think that it was only\nnecessary to _tell_ their troubles to these amazing strangers, to have\nthem solved. Stories about the use of water to drive the space ship, had\ncirculated throughout the cities, crediting the newcomers with\nsuperhuman powers.\n\nAs the little party crept nearer, they separated, to approach the\nopening from every direction. Dick was to fire first--if he saw anything\nto shoot at! It might be a powerful machine, clamped to the outer\nsurface, instead of a being that could be injured. The glass globes of\nthe masks were clouding with moisture, and it was hard to see.\n\nA thud came, that didn't vibrate quite as much, and the men could feel\nthe hair on their necks stiffen. It was now or never, and Dick fired\nalthough he was still several feet from the opening. He fired at the\ntopmost section of the ram, hoping it might stop the hammering for a\nmoment even if it didn't injure the equipment. Two more shots rang out,\nbefore the object could deliver another blow.\n\n_It was alive!_ The heavy ram _jumped_ from the shock of the bullets,\ncurving convulsively to one side of the opening. Then it drew back out\nof sight.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n_Battle with a Monster_\n\n\nMinutes passed, while the earthmen hardly dared breathe. Their ebbing\nheartbeat seemed to almost echo in their breasts. Then the object\nappeared at the opening, hesitated, and was thrust in!\n\n_The hammer was a head!!!_ It swayed back and forth, like the head of a\nhuge caterpillar, and every gun fired in unison. Shot after shot pumped\ninto the head with rapid and unerring accuracy.\n\nThe giant head moved from one side to the other, while two gigantic eyes\npeered around. It didn't know enough to draw back from the danger zone,\nbut muscular reaction finally moved it out of sight.\n\nDick crept forward, motioning for the others to wait until he\ninvestigated. There was no need for all of them to enter the danger\nzone.\n\nHe turned the flashlight on, that had been strapped to his waist, and\nplayed it around the jagged opening, then climbed to the next level and\nsearched again.\n\nWhen he crawled to the outer surface, the creature was writhing a few\nfeet away. He motioned, and the other men soon joined him, where they\ncould watch the creature.\n\nThey were standing almost on the direct center of the dome, where it was\nalmost flat. The flashlights penetrated the mists enough to mark out the\nshape of the attacker, when they were all centered.\n\nSuddenly they felt sick to their stomachs.\n\nIt _was_ a caterpillar! As loathsome a creature as they could have\nimagined with its curled body, and the farthest possible thing from a\nhuman being. A form of life that existed in the poison gases, where men\nwould die within minutes. The muscles of the creature had to be\nterrifically strong, to move against the gravity of the huge globe.\n\nEven at the center of the dome, they felt less effect of the neutralized\ngravity of the interior. It required effort to stand on their feet. Some\neffect of the neutralizers in the giant pillars, which eliminated most\nof the weight of the dome, enabled them to handle their bodies.\n\nThe creature before them was accustomed to normal gravity of the heavy\nplanet, and even the metal of the dome was not beyond the pounding of\nits hammer. What they had mistaken for a battering ram, was the brown\ntip of the mammoth insect. From end to end it measured over sixty feet.\nThe men finally turned away in disgust, as it writhed in muscular\nreaction.\n\nJohn McCarthy was climbing into the opening behind the other men, when\nhe happened to glance back. His flashlight dimly lighted the spot where\nthe monster had been, and _it was gone_!\n\nHe hesitated with one foot in the air, then realized what had happened.\nThe movement of the body had moved it farther and farther from the\ncenter of the dome. It had reached a place where the curve was\nsufficient to let it slide on the smooth metal. A moment later, a slight\njar was felt through the entire structure--it had slid from the man-made\nmound, to crash on the ground below. Memory of that sight made a sober\nreturn to the interior.\n\nBefore they dared rest, metal sheets were carried to the opening and\nblocked in place. Then dome men welded them to the solid metal. They\ndidn't want to see any of those creatures in the cities!\n\nTwelve hours had passed by the time the opening was sealed, and the\nearthmen dragged their tired forms through the maze of supports for the\nlast time.\n\nThey were almost asleep before they could reach their own apartments,\nand tumble onto comfortable beds. They had conquered the first problem.\n\nDick was awakened by an excited man, talking faster than he could\nunderstand the new language. When he grasped what the other was saying,\nhe leaped from bed wide awake.\n\n_Every dome had been attacked!!!_ The caterpillars were pounding many\nspots on each one. They seemed to be trying to get at the creatures that\nhad destroyed one of their number.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn that moment Dick felt like an old man. He thought of the space ship;\nthe only way of attacking from the outside, and gave that up. There\nwasn't enough fuel to handle it, and the blasts might injure the metal\ndomes. His mind searched frantically for some way of fighting _all_ of\nthe creatures--and knew it couldn't be done.\n\nHe was racing across the open ground, while thousands of people gazed at\nthe banging overhead. Suddenly he stopped, then turned back toward his\napartment, running just as hard. There was a system of communication\nbetween the domes--that _sometimes_ worked! It was not efficient, but if\nhe could get in touch with the others immediately, there was _one_\nchance!\n\nHe tried frantically to get a connection, but it wasn't until one of the\nnatives helped with the intricate system of signals, that he heard the\nvoice of Andrew Smith. A few moments later Philip Jones answered, then\nJerold Brown and Peter Yarbro. Each man was given quick, yet explicit,\ninstruction.\n\nWhen Dick turned away from the phone, John McCarthy entered the room,\nfollowed by George Martin. The noise in the city had finally aroused\nthem from their slumber.\n\nJohn started to smile, but the expression on Barrow's face drove all\nthought of greeting away.\n\n\"_What is it?_ I thought the people were doing a day's work--but\n_you_----!!!\" His face turned ashen as he ran to the balcony, George\nMartin only a step behind. After gazing up for a moment, McCarthy turned\nslowly to face Dick.\n\n\"The worms? It sounds like _hundreds of them_! We better work fast, or\nthey'll have the whole roof down around our ears.\"\n\n\"No, John. We can't fight them with guns. _They have attacked every dome\non the planet!_\"\n\nWhen full realization came to the big Irishman, he sank slowly into a\nchair. \"Then what? Have you got any plan--or are we helpless?\"\n\n\"We've got work to do and plenty of it. There's a slight chance of\nsaving the cities. I've already instructed the others.\"\n\nAs the three men raced toward the power plant, Dick explained. John and\nGeorge were to do the work, while he traveled from dome to dome to make\nsure the people were prepared, and see that the power plants were used\nas he intended.\n\nBy the time they reached the entrance of the building, John nodded, and\nBarrow turned back as the other men entered the door. The first dome\npeople that Dick saw were told to remove everyone from the buildings,\nand gather them in the open spaces of the parks. _Leaving no one within\nany structure!_\n\nThe expression on his face scared them even more than the pounding of\nthe worms, and they hurried to obey.\n\nDick jumped into the nearest ground car. He couldn't be bothered\ntraveling on the railroads. This happened to belong to the assistant\nhead of the dome, whom he dispossessed. It jerked crazily across streets\nand parks, while he learned to handle the controls.\n\nAn hour later Dick was back at the powerhouse in the big dome. Every\ncity was ready. In several places the hammering heads had broken through\nthe outer layers, and were banging at the translucent inner ceiling. The\ncreatures _had learned how_ to break through.\n\nThe first worm that attacked, while the space ship was away, either took\nits time or didn't realize what was beneath the heavy metal. These\ncreatures were working in earnest.\n\nHeavy insulated cables ran from the powerhouse to the nearest metal\npillars, where McCarthy and Martin were working desperately to fasten\nthem in place. The booming voice of the Irishman had kept the natives\nback, although they crowded as close as they dared. They were really\nafraid, when the hammering grew plainer with each passing minute.\n\nWhen the cables were fastened, John shouted to Dick, who was waiting in\nthe powerhouse. He pulled a heavy switch, at the end of the wires.\n\nThe city was suddenly in complete darkness, then it flashed bright again\nas power flowed back into the thousands of coils in the ceiling\nmaterial. Twice more it darkened, when the giant switch was thrown, and\nthe lights came on again. This time it stayed bright.\n\nDick ran to the doorway, and gazed at the dome above. _It was silent!_\nThe people were frightened, and moved restlessly about. Twice more he\nturned the power into the metal, and after one long darkened period, the\ncity remained bright. _No sound came from the dome!_ Either the worms\nwere dead--or frightened away!\n\nWithin a week the doors to the deserted city were opened, and the\nearthmen passed through. When they glimpsed the interior, they stopped\nin consternation, then started to laugh.\n\nHuge worms covered the ground, and smaller editions of the same species,\ncrawled around them. _They were using the dome for a hatching place!_\n\nThey had only entered it to bring forth their young! It was not _brains_\nthat tempted them to attack the city, but the instinct to find a\nprotected place for their eggs. Since they had broken in, many of the\nyoung had hatched, and were crawling around the ground.\n\nSight of the earthmen seemed to excite their feelings, and several of\nthe creatures started toward them. The men fired carefully, and the\nforms squirmed on the ground. The ones that came behind stopped, and\nsome of the young tried to feed on the remains of their companions.\n\nThe sight was so sickening that the earthmen fired at every living thing\nthey could see. Several of the wounded creatures crawled up the huge\npillars, to disappear through the opening above, while the men shot at\ntheir disappearing forms. When the last caterpillar lay dead, the entire\narea appeared like a battlefield.\n\nThree days later the gas had been expelled, and the hole in the dome\nrepaired. The population was returning to their homes, burying the\ncarcasses in the fields. The city was livable again, and they knew\nelectric current would stop any future attack of the strange creatures.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTen years later, Dick Barrow sat on the balcony before his apartment.\nHis son John, eight years old, was playing with Dick McCarthy. While he\nwatched the boys, his mind swung back to the earth the little group had\nleft so many years before.\n\nFor three years they had talked of returning to their home planet, and\nthe evening before the conversation reached a climax. They were starting\nin two months.\n\nIt no longer required years to manufacture fuel for one trip. All\nmachinery was working at top efficiency, and they could turn out enough\nof the liquid in a month, to drive the ship back and forth several\ntimes. Crews of workmen had been trained to care for all mechanical\nequipment, and there was no longer need for the engineers from the\nearth.\n\nThe day the little party (it now consisted of eighteen with the four\nchildren), entered the space ship tears rolled down the cheeks of many\nof the crowd. The dome people had learned to almost worship these\nmembers of an alien race, and thought they would never leave. But when\nthey realized that their leaders were dissatisfied, and wanted to return\nto their native planet, they aided in every way they knew how.\n\nThe ship was out of port for less than a week when the people became\nrestless. They hardly spoke, even at meal time, and for the first time\nin ten years there were petty quarrels.\n\nWhen Barrow called them to the main cabin, they came grudgingly, then\nslowly the expressions changed. Smiles appeared on their faces, and\ntheir heads moved with sheepish nods of assent.\n\n\"We're fools, and you all know it. We were happy in the domes, happier\nthan we ever were in our lives before. We didn't appreciate it and\nlonged to return to the earth. We wanted to leave, yet had everything\nthere to live for. We had comfort, every pleasure, and more friends than\nwe can possibly have on our own world. _I feel ashamed!_\n\n\"Right now we _wish_ that we were back in our own apartments, and might\nas well admit it. The earth is not what we want, _we want the domes_!\nThey are _home_!!!\n\n\"The best thing for us to do, now that we are on the way to the earth,\nis establish commerce.\n\n\"We can create friendship between the planets, but we are natives of\nJupiter! Our interests will always be with the dome people. We have\nalmost become part of that race, and they have given us everything in\nreturn. They even gave us our freedom when we wanted it. _We belong\nthere!_\"\n\nTen years more passed, and John Barrow was beginning to help with his\nfather's work. Vacationing in Jupiter's domes had become so popular on\nthe earth that they were building another city to accommodate the\ntourist trade. It was the third to be added to the original six.\nMerchant ships were constantly discharging goods from the earth, and\ncarrying back rare metals.\n\nSpace ships from the earth, designed after the original Jupiter ship,\nwere searching the little known planets for minerals. Domes were being\nbuilt on three of the smaller globes, and pioneering humans migrated to\nnew worlds. There was danger, yes, but also fame and fortune for the\nhardy people who would inhabit them.\n\nThe earth had changed a lot, since the visit of the space ship. They had\nadopted the principle of controlling gravity, and tremendous structures\nwere the result. New buildings were several times as large as the\ngreatest structure of ten years before. Both planets had benefited from\nthe friendship, and both were happier as a result.\n\nAs Dick Barrow's mind ran over these facts, he smiled and spoke aloud to\nhimself. \"And all of this in twenty years--it seems incredible!\"\n\n\"What did you say, dear?\" asked Dolores.\n\nDick smiled as he glanced at her. \"It's nothing. I was just thinking.\nRemember the night you fell in front of my table in the hotel? And I\nthought it was _accidental_--you scheming gold-digger!\"\n\nThe ruler of the domes ducked when his wife threw her book--but she\ndidn't throw it very hard.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[1] This gravity power was derived from huge weights swung on an axis\nthat could be faced toward any point in the universe, and the slightest\npull resulted in force that was exerted on the fuel. The explosive\nmixture remained at constant pressure, creating a smooth driving medium.\nDischarge of the fuel under high compression resulted in greater power\nthan could be obtained in any other way.\n\nWhen the fuel shot through the tubes, it exerted force on the gas cloud\nthat was far above the actual speed of the explosion. The heat of\ncombustion was reduced, and the ship operated without effect from the\nblasts. The tubes were small, yet the power expended was beyond anything\never accomplished on earth.--Author.\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ April 1956 and was\n    first published in _Amazing Stories_ February 1939.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
