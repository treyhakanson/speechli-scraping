Nor could anyone, glancing at him, know he was not a\nnative of this planet, Szstruyyah, which the Inter-Stellar Corpsmen,\nin self-defense, called \"Estrella.\" For the cosmetic-specialist who\nhandled the secret servicemen's disguises had done a marvelous job in\ntransforming the blond young Corpsman into an Estrellan native.\n\nHanlon continued looking into the outside cages containing these\ntailless roches, the Estrellan equivalent of wild dogs. \"I want eight,\nall as near the same size, coloring and age as possible.\"\n\n\"Eight, did you say?\" the merchant looked at him in astonishment.\nHanlon, carefully reading the surface of the man's mind, sensed the\nconflict there between the ethics his religion and philosophy had\ntaught him, his natural love of haggling, and a desire to make as much\nprofit as possible. But he could not sense the slightest suspicion that\nthe man confronting him was not another Estrellan.\n\nThis was a great relief to Hanlon, for he was still afraid he might be\nrecognized as a stranger and an alien. In his disguise he was still\nhumanoid in shape, and still his five feet eleven inches in height.\nBut in addition to the ragged beard and longish hair, he had undergone\noutward structural differences that made him seem almost totally\nunhuman.\n\n\"That's right. Eight. I want them to be about two years old, in good\nhealth. Can you supply them?\"\n\n\"I can if you can pay for them,\" the native looked somewhat\nquestioningly at Hanlon's cheap clothing.\n\nThe young secret serviceman smiled, and jingled coins in his pocket. \"I\ncan pay.\"\n\n\"Then come with me, nyer, and we will find the ones you want.\"\n\nHanlon followed him inside the peculiar little open-faced stall that\nwas one of the hundreds surrounding the great market square of this\ncity of Stearra, largest on the West Continent of Estrella. His nose\nwrinkled against the stench of the uncleaned kennels.\n\nThe roches, seeing a stranger and, perhaps, being somewhat upset by his\nstrange, alien effluvia, set up the peculiar, frenzied yelping that was\ntheir customary sound. To Hanlon, it was reminiscent of the wail of\nearthly coyotes.\n\nThe young Corpsman was on a very hair-trigger of caution and tenseness.\nDespite his splendid disguise, he had plodded through the crowd of the\nmarket place with a great deal of trepidation.\n\nHe had seemingly come through all right so far, and he began to relax\na bit, yet was still somewhat fearful that he might give himself away\nby some difference of action, or speech, or by breaking one of their\ncustoms or taboos about which he knew all too little, despite his\nbriefing and study before coming here.\n\n\"Have you decided which ones you want, nyer?\" the proprietor asked,\nwaving his hand toward the various cages, hardly able to believe he was\nto make such a large sale.\n\nHanlon said nothing, continuing to scan closely the roches, for his\nthoughts were still very much on this, his first prolonged venture\ninto the streets and among the crowds of this strange new world to\nwhich he had been assigned on his second problem.\n\nHis mind was constantly contacting others, for George Spencer Newton\nHanlon was the only member of the secret service who was at all able\nto read minds. But he could read only their surface thoughts--and\nthese Estrellans had such peculiar mental processes, so different from\nthose of the humans with whom he was familiar, that they were almost\nnon-understandable.\n\nSo he was still a bit hesitant to start the bickering he knew he must\nengage in to stay in character. To delay a bit further he continued\nexamining the animals in the cages, not only with his eyes but mentally\nscanning the brain of each, that he might be sure of finding those in\nperfect health, with minds he could most easily control.\n\n\"Though how I can expect to find healthy ones in a filthy dump like\nthis, I don't know,\" he thought. But he finally did.\n\nWhile he was doing this, however, he was reminded of the time he had\ndiscovered this ability to \"read\" animal minds, and how his subsequent\nstudies had enabled him to control their minds and bodily actions with\namazing skill. It was this ability that had led him to this market\nplace on his unusual quest.\n\n\"I'll take that one, and that, and that,\" he said at last, pointing\nout, one after another, the eight animals he wanted.\n\n\"Yes, nyer, yes,\" the puzzled but delighted proprietor said, as he\ntransferred the indicated animals to a single, large cage. \"That will\ncost you ...\" he eyed Hanlon carefully to see if he could get away with\nan exorbitant price. Something seemed to tell him the stranger did not\nknow just how much roches customarily sold for, and he decided to raise\nhis asking price considerably. \"... they will be seven silver pentas\neach, nyer, and believe me, you are getting a fine price. I usually get\nten each,\"--he was lucky to get two, Hanlon read in his mind--\"but\nsince this is such a large sale I can afford to make you a bargain.\"\n\nHanlon grinned to himself as he computed quickly. Five iron pentas,\nhe knew, made one copper penta, five coppers one tin penta, five of\nthese one silver penta, and five silvers a gold one. This made the\nsilver piece worth about one-half a Federation credit. The price seemed\nridiculously low, even with this big mark-up. Hanlon would willingly\nhave paid it, but he had learned from the briefing tapes, and again\nnow from his reading of this merchant's mind, that they loved to\nhaggle over their sales--made a sort of game of it--so he turned away,\nregistering disgust.\n\n\"A fool you think me, perhaps,\" he said witheringly. \"Seven silver\npentas, indeed. One would be a great price for such ill-fed, scrawny,\npitiable animals as those.\"\n\nThe merchant raised his hands and voice in simulated rage--which did\nnot prevent him from running around to face Hanlon's retreating figure,\nand bar his way. \"'Robber', he calls me, then tries to rob me in turn.\nSix?\" he suggested hopefully.\n\nHanlon was now enjoying the game, and threw himself into it with vigor.\n\"I call on Zappa to witness that you are, indeed, the worst thief\nunhung,\" he also spoke loudly, angrily, largely for the benefit of the\ncrowd of natives that was swiftly gathering to watch and listen to this\nsport. \"Look, that one is crooked of leg, this one's hair is ready to\nfall out, that one is fifteen years old if a day. I'll give you two.\"\n\nYet he knew all the animals were in perfect health, and all about two\nyears old. He had carefully selected only such.\n\n\"I ask anyone here,\" the seller wailed as he waved toward the crowd\nthat was watching and listening with huge enjoyment, \"I ask anyone\nhere who knows roches to examine these you have chosen. They are all\nexceptional, all perfect. The best in my shop. Five and a half.\"\n\nHanlon turned away again. \"I'll go find an _honest_ dealer,\" he started\nto push through the crowd, but the merchant hurried after him and\ngrasped his smock. \"Wait, nyer, wait. It breaks my heart to do this.\nI'll lose a month's profit, but I'll sell them to you for five pentas\neach. To my best friend I wouldn't give a better price.\"\n\n\"That shows why you have no friends. Three even, take it or leave it,\"\nHanlon was still pretending indifference.\n\n\"I'm ruined; I'll be forced out of business,\" the dealer screamed.\n\"They cost me more than that. Oh, why did I rise this morning. Give me\nfour?\"\n\nHanlon grinned and dug out a handful of the pentagonal-shaped gold and\nsilver pieces. He counted into the merchant's quivering but dirty hands\nthe agreed-upon thirty-two pentas.\n\nThe native looked at them, wordlessly, but his face was a battleground\nof mixed emotions. Finally he reluctantly counted out half of them\ninto his other hand, and held them out to Hanlon. \"No, nyer, I cannot\nover-charge you. Two is the price.\"\n\n\"You're an honest man after all, and I apologize,\" Hanlon said,\nsmiling, as he pushed back the outstretched hand. \"Those I chose are\nfine animals, perfect, and the best in your shop. So keep the money.\nSend them to my room this midday,\" he commanded. \"It's on the street of\nthe Seven Moons, at the corner of the street of the Limping Caval--the\nhouse painted pink in front. Second floor to the rear. My name--Gor\nAnlo--is on the door.\"\n\nHe had taken that name on this planet since it most nearly corresponded\nto his own from among the common Estrellan names.\n\nThe roch-dealer, well pleased with the outcome, bobbed obsequiously.\n\"It shall be done as you say, nyer, and I shall include feeding and\ndrinking dishes. What about food for them?\"\n\n\"That's right, they'll need dishes, and thank you. Let's see your\nmeat.\" But after examining the poor quality food the merchant\ndisplayed, he would not buy.\n\n\"I'll get something elsewhere, if this is the best you have,\" Hanlon\ntold the man with a disarming smile. \"Such fine roches deserve the\nbest.\"\n\n\"Yes, my food is poor,\" the dealer moved his hand deprecatingly. \"I'm\nglad the roches are to have such a considerate master.\"\n\nAnd Hanlon could read in his mind that the merchant actually was\npleased. The S S man felt that he had passed this first public test\nwith high grades.\n\nIn one of the better-class food stalls Hanlon found some good, clean\nmeat, and the other foods such animals ate. After the customary game of\nhaggling, he ordered a two days' supply to be delivered at once, and\nthe order duplicated every other day until further notice.\n\nThen he hunted up a suit-maker. Here it took a lot of persuasion, and\nthe showing of his money, before the tailor would even believe that\nHanlon really meant what he said when he tried to order nine uniforms,\neight of them of such outlandish shape and size. For one of them was\nfor himself, the others for his newly-bought roches.\n\nIt was only when Hanlon finally lost patience and said sharply, \"You\nstupid lout, I want them for a theatrical act,\" that the uniform-maker\nrealized the reason for such an unusual order. Then things ran\nsmoothly. The design was sketched, and material of a red to harmonize\nwith the grayish-tan of the roches was chosen. The tailor consented\nalso, for an added fee, to rush the job.\n\nHanlon's way home led through part of the district where the larger,\nbetter-class shops were located. He stopped in front of one of these.\n\nHe knew from his studies and from what he had seen here, that Estrella\nwas just at the beginning of a mechanical culture. What sciences\nand machines they had were unbelievably crude and primitive to him,\naccustomed as he was to the high technologies of Terra and the\ncolonized planets.\n\nThis display he was scanning featured their means of personal\ntransportation. There were, of course, no moving slideways, nor even\nautomobiles nor ground cabs nor copters. Instead, the Estrellans used\nmotorized tricycles. Even the smallest of these was heavy, cumbersome,\ncrude and inefficient, but they were speedier and easier than\nwalking--when they worked.\n\nThe tricycles had large wheels, about three feet in diameter, with\nsemi-hard, rubber-like tires. There were two wheels in back and one in\nfront, steered by a tiller lever. Because of the weight of the engine\nand tank for the gas, even the smallest trike weighed several hundred\npounds.\n\nThe fuel was acetylene gas, Hanlon found to his dismay. Electricity\nhad been discovered here, but as yet they knew only direct current.\nNo AC--no vacuum tubes--no telephones--no radios--no television--\"ner\nnothing,\" Hanlon snorted in disgust.\n\nBut the native scientists and technicians had found how to use their D\nC to manufacture calcium carbide. Thus, they had plenty of acetylene\ngas, and many ways of using this for power.\n\n\"I'd lots rather have a good two-wheeled bike,\" Hanlon thought to\nhimself, but decided, \"guess I'd better buy one of these. Probably have\nto do a lot of chasing around, and since there's no 'for hire' ground\ncabs, I don't want to have to walk all the time. Besides, I might have\nto get somewhere in a hurry.\"\n\nThe salesman had first tried to sell him one of the larger three- or\nfour-place family-sized tricycles that steered with a wheel. But Hanlon\nfinally made the man understand that he wanted only a one-man machine,\nand the purchase was haggled into completion--at a price so low it\nsurprised the young secret serviceman.\n\n\"Sure is one screwy world,\" he shook his head as he rode back toward\nhis apartment, after learning how to operate his new machine and its\ntricky engine.\n\nBack in his room, Hanlon reviewed the situation to date on this, his\nsecond assignment for the secret service of the Inter-Stellar Corps. He\nhad been at the head of the commission sent to Algon where he (Hanlon)\nhad been largely instrumental in freeing from slavery the strange,\nvegetable-like people, the Guddus.[1] The commission had helped them\nmake a treaty with the Federated Planets by which the natives allowed\nthe humans to mine certain valuable metals from their planet, and to\nmaintain the spaceship-yards that had been built by the men who had\nformerly enslaved them, in return for protection from exploiters, and\nfor certain cultural assistance. Just as his work there was about\nfinished, a message had come for Captain Hanlon to report back to the\nplanet Simonides.\n\n[Footnote 1: See \"MAN OF MANY MINDS,\" Fantasy Press, 1953.]\n\nThere he met his father, Regional Admiral Newton, second in command\nof the secret service. (This discrepancy of names was due to the\nfact that after young Spencer Newton's mother died, and his father\n\"disappeared\"--at the time he joined the secret service--the boy was\nadopted by George Hanlon, an ex-Corpsman, and his wife, and had taken\nhis foster-father's name.)\n\n\"We're not getting anywhere on Estrella,\" his father had begun abruptly\nonce they had warmly greeted each other. \"I've come to the conclusion,\nand the Council agrees, that we need your special mental abilities\nthere. But take it easy, Spence ... er, I never can seem to get used\nto calling you 'George'. Don't try to go it alone ... and you can wipe\nthat cocky smirk off your face, mister,\" he commanded sternly. \"This\ntime it's an official order from the top brass. Those Estrellans are\ndistinctly alien--not humans gone wrong.\"\n\nHanlon sobered down a bit, but secretly could not entirely shake off\nhis attitude, feeling sure he was more than a match for any trouble\nhe might run into. Hadn't he proved it, on Algon and right here on\nSimonides? Sure he had. Great Snyder, he wasn't a kid any more. He was\na secret serviceman of the Inter-Stellar Corps, whom they called in\nwhen the rest of them, even his adored dad, failed.\n\n\"Just what's the problem there?\" he asked, trying not to let these\nthoughts show in his face.\n\n\"The people of Estrella are not colonists from Terra or any of the\ncolonized planets,\" the admiral explained slowly. \"They are native to\nthat world--the first such, by the way, that we have discovered who are\nadvanced enough to be asked to join the Federation with equal status.\nThey are quite man-like in shape, and of a high order of civilization.\nTheir culture is much like Earth's was two hundred and fifty or three\nhundred years ago.\"\n\n\"Just beginning their real introduction to scientific and mechanical\ntechnologies on a planetary scale, eh?\"\n\n\"That's it. Their system was discovered and mapped a few years ago.\nThe Colonial Board immediately sent psychologists and linguists there\nto learn their language and study the natives and their form of\ngovernment, their economics and general advancement. What they found,\nalthough far different from our own, was so surprisingly high that we\nsent them a formal offer to join the Federation. But ...\" he stopped,\nfrowning.\n\n\"Yes?\" Hanlon was interested now, and paying close attention. \"But\nwhat?\"\n\n\"That's what we don't know. At first they seemed very pleased with the\noffer. They studied it carefully and, at our suggestion, sent a picked\ngroup of statesmen, scientists and merchants on a trip to our various\nworlds in one of our ships. These men and women seemed delighted with\nwhat they found, and enthusiastic about their world joining us. But,\nshortly after their return home and before the final treaties were\nsigned, opposition began to develop.\"\n\n\"What kind of...?\"\n\n\"All kinds. Enough to make the plans slow down and halt. The embassy\nsent there couldn't discover the reason--we have trouble enough\nunderstanding their way of thinking at all--and they yelled for help.\nWe sent a couple of S S men there, and when they failed, I went there\nmyself, to help them, and the embassy came home.\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"I can't find a thing, either, that seems\nsignificant. Oh, the surface opposition is easily discernable. Papers,\nhandbills, inflammatory speeches by spellbinders, whispering campaigns,\nall calling for keeping Estrella for the Estrellans and running out all\nforeigners bent on plundering the planet for their own enrichment--that\nsort of thing.\"\n\n\"Maybe some natives who want to take over, themselves,\" Hanlon ventured.\n\n\"Could be. We've thought of that, but have found no proof. We have no\nproof of anything except the opposition. Only one thing, that may or\nmay not have something to do with this. We've discovered that almost\nsimultaneously with this opposition an unprecedented crime wave started\nthere--every type of criminal activity imaginable, and that is almost\nunheard of on that world. But we can't even get the first leads as to\n_who_ is behind it all. That's why I suggested you be called in, and\nthe staff agreed.\"\n\nThe admiral paused and his piercing gray eyes bored earnestly into\nthe blue ones of his son. \"Keep this in mind at all times, Spence,\nfor it is most important. We _must_ succeed there. This is the first\nnon-Terran world we've found equal in cultural advancement to ours. But\nsurely it won't be the last. And we must win them over. All civilized\nworlds must band together for mutual growth and well-being. So this is\nour most important project just now.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" seriously, \"I can see that. Also, that if we do get them to join\nus, we can point out that fact to any other planets we may discover and\ntry to bring into the Federation in the future.\"\n\n_And lying at ease on a heavily-padded bench before the control board\nof a space cruiser, a stranger looked deeply into a multiphased scanner\nthat worked on scientific principles not yet discovered by humans._\n\n_For long, long months its mind had been studying this new world and\nits inhabitants. The language had been learned, after a fashion, as\nhad much of the planetary economics and governmental intricacies. Now\nthe minds of the people were being studied; it was searching, always\nsearching, for certain types._\n\n_But part of that mind remained continually in that of one certain\nEstrellan it had long ago selected._\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\n\nSo now SSM George Hanlon was here on this planet they called Estrella,\ntrying to see what he could find out. It was hard, devilishly and\nmaddeningly hard, to discern what these people were really thinking. It\nwasn't their language--that had been fairly easy to sleep-learn from\nthe reels. No, it was their mental processes--the way they thought. He\nwas not too sure of himself yet, even with his ability to read their\nsurface thoughts, for so often those thoughts held connotations he was\nnot sure he understood.\n\nFor the Estrellan mind was so different from those of humans--its\ntexture was coarser, for one thing, and the thought-concept symbols\nlargely non-understandable to him so far. He had studied--he winced to\nthink how hard he had studied--and he had practiced assiduously since\narriving here. But he still could get only an occasional thought-idea\nof whose meaning he felt at all sure ... it was far worse than with\nhumans. True, he was making some progress, but it was so--he grinned\nmirthlessly--\"fast like a turtle.\" Yet he did not allow discouragement\nto keep him from continuing with his work.\n\nFor during the week he had been here he had managed to pick up some\nfacts of which he felt sure. He decided his best method of approach lay\nwith this new criminal element, for he was convinced from his study of\nthe problem that they were, somehow, tied in with whoever was behind\nall the opposition to Estrella's joining the Federation of Planets. The\ntremendous increase in crime, so foreign to the general nature of these\nhigh-principled beings, and coming simultaneously with the development\nof that opposition, was not, he felt sure, coincidental. Working from\nthe inside against a criminal gang had worked on Simonides--it might be\nequally successful here.\n\nHe had found what he felt was proof that a certain Ino Yandor, this\nworld's greatest purveyor of entertainment, was actually a ring-leader\nin the criminal web, in this city, at least. And he had figured\nthat the best way to get acquainted with this man was to pose as an\nentertainer.\n\nBecause of his ability to control the minds and muscles of animals, he\ndecided to be an animal trainer. Hence his apparently strange action in\nbuying eight Estrellan roches, or dogs. He had figured out an act that\nhe thought was a dilly.\n\n\"At least,\" he grinned to himself, \"it would knock 'em in the aisles on\nTerra or the human planets. But with these folks ...\" he shrugged away\nthe doubts.\n\nSuddenly, as Hanlon was sitting there thinking all these things, he\nheard a tremendous commotion outside the house. There were the excited\nyells of many children, a terrific uproar of yelps and whines that he\nrecognized as made by his roches, and the shrill complainings of the\nelders living in this and the adjacent houses.\n\n\"Oh, oh, my pups are being delivered,\" Hanlon grinned, and ran out to\nmeet the messenger. As soon as he was in sight of the crowd, he began\ntouching one rochian mind after another, sending them calming thoughts,\nand quieting their frenzied yelpings. By the time the eight dogs were\nin his rooms, they were well under control, and lay down as soon as\nthey were inside.\n\nHanlon good-naturedly answered many of the questions hurled at him by\nthe inquisitive youngsters; assured the apprehensive neighbors that\nhe would see to it that the roches did not bother them; dismissed the\nman who had delivered the animals, with thanks and a gold penta, then\nhurriedly closed the door against the crowd still in the hallway.\n\nHe then settled down into a comfortable seat, and proceeded to get\nacquainted with his new pets. He first had to learn the texture of\ntheir individual minds, which were like yet different from those of\nearthly animals. Then each roch's individual characteristics had to be\nstudied and learned, and the animal's wild nature more or less tamed\nand subdued, which last he found quite easy to do--from within.\n\nThe animals, in turn, had to become used to Hanlon's taking control of\ntheir minds and bodily functions, and of allowing him to handle them\nmentally without fighting back or trying not to obey.\n\nThis was eminently tricky work, but Hanlon's previous practice with\nmany animals, birds and insects, both here and on Simonides and Algon,\nhad given him facility so he was able to do it fairly easily.\n\n\"Why, they're really just nice little pooches at heart, in spite of\nthat snout that looks like a pig's, set in that flat face. But I\nlike 'em, and I think this'll work out OK.\" He fed and watered his\npseudo-dogs, then let them go to sleep, as he was preparing to do.\n\nRight after he and the roches had breakfasted the next morning, he set\nto work in earnest on their training for the special routines he had\nplanned. As the day sped swiftly by he found his ideas working out even\nmore satisfactorily than he had hoped. It would not be too long before\nhe was ready to make contact with that Ino Yandor, the theatrical agent.\n\nThe following day Hanlon stayed in his room again, working with the\nanimals, training them in group maneuvers, having learned how to handle\nthem individually. It was a weird feeling, dissociating part of his\nmind and placing it in that of a roch, and with that portion of his\nmind consciously controlling the animal's brain to direct its nerves\nand muscles to do what he wanted done. And when he did this to eight\nroches simultaneously--well, even though he had done similar things\nbefore, it was still hard to get used to the idea that it was possible.\n\nSo hard had he been working that he was surprised when he happened to\nnotice how dark it was getting. He went over and looked out of the\nwindow in his room, and saw it was night outside. A glance at the\nEstrellan time-teller on the wall, and he saw it was the dinner hour.\n\nHe rose and stretched, yawning vigorously. \"Better get out and get some\nfresh air,\" he thought. He took the dogs for a half hour's run outside,\nthen brought them back, fed and watered them. He impressed on their\nminds that when they were finished they were to go to sleep. Then again\nhe left the building.\n\nHe couldn't help grinning a bit as he was walking down the street,\nthinking of the screwy way these people handled the problem of where\nto live. For the common, ordinary, not-too-rich people, there were\napartment buildings, such as the one in which he lived, owned and\noperated by the government. When anyone wanted a room or an apartment,\nhe merely hunted around in the district in which he wished to live\nuntil he found an empty place that suited him, then moved in. There was\nno landlord, no rent. Taxes paid for it.\n\nYou were supposed to take care of your own cleaning and minor repairs,\nor any special decorating you wanted done. Major repairs were handled\nupon request, by men paid by the government. If your furniture wore\nout, or no longer suited you, you simply moved to a place you liked\nbetter--and some other poorer person had to take what you had left, if\nall other rooms were occupied. Yet so considerate of others were the\naverage Estrellans, that they seldom did this, preferring to replace\nthe worn-out things themselves, if financially able to do so.\n\n\"Imagine the average Terran doing that,\" Hanlon had thought,\nwonderingly, when he first heard of it.\n\nHe had been lucky enough to find a three-room apartment fairly close\nto the downtown section of the city, yet far enough away so the\ncrowd-noise did not bother him. The building in which he lived was of\nfour stories, and he was on the second floor, near the back.\n\nIt was the third place he had looked at when he first came to Estrella.\nHe could not at first make himself believe that all the rooms had such\nbad smells in them. But he soon found it to be true, largely because\nthese natives had nothing that could be called efficient plumbing.\nWhen he had finally picked these rooms, he spent a full day airing\nthem out, cleaning them thoroughly, and using what disinfectants and\nsmell-eradicators he was able to find and buy in the stalls here.\n\nThe peculiar-looking, five-sided rooms were comfortably furnished, by\nEstrellan standards, and not too bad even from Earthly ones. The walls\nand ceilings and floors were painted in fairly harmonious colors, and\nthere was a sort of half-matting, half-carpet rug on the floors. What\ncorresponded to the living room contained two of their low, backless\nstools, and one quite comfortable lounging chair. There was a large\nand a small table, and an empty case where one could store any reading\nscrolls he might possess.\n\nThe bedroom had a low, foot-high, five-sided bed, but it was hard and\nuncomfortable until Hanlon figured how to make it softer, and more to\nhis liking. There were several pegs on the wall from which to hang his\nclothing, two more of the backless stools, and the open place--a sort\nof well running from roof to basement--that was the toilet. Hanlon\nfound a large piece of heavy cloth something like canvas, in one of the\nstalls, and made a hanging to cover this in lieu of a door, which shut\nout some of the smell-source.\n\nThe kitchen had shelves, a stove, and table and backless stools. In one\ncorner, suspended through the ceiling, was an open water pipe with a\nsort of concrete drain beneath. This was both the source of water for\ncooking or drinking, and the bathing place--a primitive shower.\n\nThe reels furnished by Survey had told Hanlon that few of the Estrellan\nbuildings were more than five stories high. \"Some, in the business\ndistricts, may run to six or seven stories. We have concluded that the\nmain reason for this is that the natives do not have elevators, except\na few crude rope-and-pulley freight elevators in some of the stores and\noffice buildings.\"\n\nNow Hanlon sauntered slowly along the street, enjoying the fresh night\nair, warmed to about sixty-five degrees Fahrenheit, while he worked the\nkinks out of his tension-wearied body. This business of controlling the\nroches demanded such intense concentration that his mind and body were\nhighly keyed up when he finished, and he had trouble relaxing.\n\nHe saw, almost without noticing this time, the primitive street\nlighting system that made flickering lights and shadows on the\ntree-shaded walks and roads. These people used natural gas for their\nnighttime outdoor illuminating--just semi-ornate standards with the\nflames rising a foot or so above them. Men went around at dusk to light\nthem, and again at dawn to turn them off.\n\nHanlon had walked slowly for several blocks when he saw a native\napproaching him. When they came abreast the man stopped him.\n\n\"I do not remember seeing you about here before,\" he said, looking\nclosely at Hanlon in the flickering light. \"I am the peace keeper for\nthis district,\" he added as he saw Hanlon's questioning look.\n\n\"No, I just moved in a few days ago,\" Hanlon answered.\n\n\"What do you do here? Do you have a job?\"\n\n\"He thinks I'm a vag,\" Hanlon grinned to himself, and said aloud, in\na courteous voice, \"I just came from the Eastern Continent, nyer, and\nhope to become a public entertainer. I have enough money to support\nmyself until I can earn more.\"\n\n\"That is good. If I can ever be of service in helping you to get\nacquainted, please look me up. I like to see all the people in my\ndistrict happy and busy.\"\n\n\"I shall do that, nyer, and thank you for your courtesy.\" And as the\nman moved to one side, Hanlon gave him a cheery half-salute, and went\non his way. \"Darned nice people, really,\" he said to himself. \"They'll\nmake good Federation citizens.\"\n\nWhen Hanlon had started out on this stroll he had had no special\ndestination--was merely out for a breather. But as he ambled along\na thought came to him, and he quickened his pace and walked more\npurposefully toward the downtown section and a certain building he had\npreviously spotted.\n\nIt was a small \"place where men drank,\" and his investigations had\nconvinced him that many of this city's criminal element went there for\nrelaxation. The cafe occupied the street floor of a small two-storied\nbuilding that was, as were almost all the Estrellan buildings, a\nfive-sided one.\n\nFor _five_ was the sacred number of the native religion and philosophy.\nHanlon had learned that the number five was consistently used wherever\npossible, even in their architecture, their ornaments, and their coined\nmoney.\n\nTheir religion was based on five basic Truths taught by He Who Died For\nThem. These were: Love, Faith, Brotherliness, Honor, and Loyalty. Their\nphilosophy (they called it their \"Code of Living\") was also composed of\nfive parts: to be religious; to attain the highest possible mentality;\nto live physically clean lives; to be considerate of others always, and\nto be honest in all dealings.\n\nThe Terrans had found that while, of course, there were individuals who\ndid not subscribe either to their religion or their Code of Living,\nthat on the whole the race held a very high standard of ethics.\n\nNow, as he walked inside the drinking place, the young S S man saw\nthat the pentagonal room was brilliantly lighted, rather than kept dim\nas were most Terran and Simonidean cafes.\n\n\"Probably because they can't turn 'em low,\" he thought. For the lights\nwere lamps burning a carbide compound, that gave out a harsh but very\nbright light.\n\nAs Hanlon took a seat at a small table, he looked about him\ninterestedly. There was a bar across the back or third side, where the\ndrinks were mixed. On the other four sides, except where the windows\nor doors interferred, were several small booths, with drawn curtains\nacross their entrances for privacy. The balance of the floor was filled\nwith two-, three- and five-place pentagonal tables, and their chairs,\nor rather, backless stools.\n\n\"What is your wish?\" an attendant came to Hanlon's table.\n\n\"Glass of mykkyl, please.\"\n\nWhile the waiter was bringing the barely-intoxicating but very popular\ndrink, and later as Hanlon was slowly sipping it, the S S man let his\nmind roam throughout the small room, touching mind after mind, seeking\nand hoping to find those he had come here trying to locate.\n\nHe had to grit his teeth to keep from showing the frustration he\nfelt on this world when trying to understand what these people were\nthinking. For he had long since found that, whatever a human might be\nspeaking in words, his thoughts showed his true feelings simultaneously\nwith and despite what he was saying. And Hanlon could usually read\nthose surface thoughts and understand them fully.\n\nBut with the Estrellans, he had found this was not always true. There\nwas sometimes an ... an _obliqueness_ ... that could not be directly\ntranslated by one no more used to their thought-patterns than he was so\nfar.\n\nGeorge Hanlon was the only member of the Inter-Stellar Corps' secret\nservice who could read minds at all--one of the very few humans ever\nto possess this ability to any demonstrable extent. And he was still\nyoung enough to feel occasionally that he was being badly treated by\nhis inability to read these native minds at will.\n\nWhile he was on that Simonidean assignment, and on the planet of Algon,\nhe had even learned to telepath with the natives, the Guddu \"Greenies,\"\nor plant-men. But here he could not do that at all. He could read and\ncontrol animal minds, \"and these lousy Estrellans are almost animals,\"\nhe had growled beneath his breath at first, \"so why can't I handle\ntheir minds?\"\n\nBut even through this rude shock to his vanity he did not entirely lose\nhis ability to think and reason logically. He had studied the problem\nintensively for these past days, and had come to certain preliminary\nconclusions.\n\n\"It's not, after all, that they're lower in the evolutionary scale than\nwe Terrans are,\" he finally concluded. \"It's just that they haven't\nadvanced as far in scientific and technological knowledge. They may\nlook like apes, but they sure aren't. Probably, when we get to really\nknow them--if we ever do--we'll find they are 'way ahead of us in many\nthings. They certainly, as a whole, practice their 'Code of Living' far\nbetter than most of our people do their professed religion.\"\n\nThis conclusion was another shock to his confident young mind. For he\nhad more than half expected, when he first came here, to have an easy\ntime of it in solving the problem on which he and the other secret\nservicemen were working.\n\nYet how quickly he had been disabused.\n\nAnd now, in this little place where men drank, he was finding it\nout anew. None of the minds he was scanning with all the ability he\npossessed, was quite of the calibre he sought, although most of them\ndisplayed leanings toward larceny and other criminal tendencies. For\nthis drinking place was not one which the more generally law-abiding\nand decent people of Stearra cared to patronize.\n\nMaddeningly meager were the thoughts he could interpret, but when he\nfinally came to scan the minds of four natives who were seated at a\nfive-place table near the back, close to the bar, he made an almost\nunconscious exclamation of surprise and delight.\n\nHe \"listened in\" more closely to the four, who were leaning toward each\nother, talking together in low, earnest tones. Hanlon could read the\nsurface thoughts in each mind, but only occasionally at first could\nhe understand what they were discussing. However, as he became more\naccustomed to their individual peculiarities of thought, he began to\nget enough to convince him that these were the ones he was seeking. At\nleast, they were planning some deviltries, and one spoke as though he\nhad received orders as to what they were to do.\n\nHanlon even finally got their names, although of the latter he soon\nbecame interested mainly in that of the slender, blondishly-hairy\nnative with the steely blue eyes. That one, Ran Auldin, was their\nleader, Hanlon decided.\n\nMore intently now, Hanlon studied their minds, paying no further\nattention to the others in the room. He lingered over his drinks for\nnearly an hour, \"listening in\" on the conversation of these mobsters,\nand learning quite a bit about their criminal activities, and better\nhow to interpret their thoughts.\n\nSuddenly he stiffened in even closer attention.\n\n\"The leader,\" Auldin was saying to his henchmen, but Hanlon knew from\nhis side thoughts that the fellow meant Ino Yandor, \"wants us to start\na series of fires and wreckings about the city. We'll get a list of\nplaces tomorrow or next day, and that night we'll do the job.\"\n\n\"In the name of Zappa, why?\" one of the men asked. \"Why would he want\nus to do that?\"\n\n\"Who cares why?\" Auldin shrugged. \"The leader, he tells us 'do this',\nand we do it, that's all.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" another chimed in. \"We get paid for our work, and good pay,\ntoo. So let the big fellows worry about why they want certain things\ndone.\"\n\n\"That's the way to look at it,\" Auldin said. \"We'll meet here tomorrow\nevening, and I'll probably have the list. If not tomorrow, then next\nday. But meet here tomorrow, anyway.\"\n\nSo, Hanlon thought swiftly. Just like small-time crooks everywhere.\nSomebody with brains does the bossing, and they stupidly follow orders,\ninterested only in the pay they receive, caring nothing about who or\nwhat gets hurt.\n\nThese fellows were certainly worth watching, he decided. Even if it did\nnot lead him to the larger goal he was seeking--and he felt sure it\nwould--he would spike their plans somehow.\n\nHe felt he had heard enough for the time being, so he rose and left the\ndrinking place before they should notice him. He walked slowly back to\nhis apartment, thinking about this new plan, wondering, as the mobster\nhad done, why such orders were given. It made no sense to him, unless\nit was that the chief criminals were merely intent on spreading a reign\nof terror and destruction.\n\n\"Or are they,\" he thought suddenly, \"planning later to make it seem as\nthough we Terrans are doing it? Perhaps planning to start a whispering\ncampaign of such rumors?\"\n\nMore than ever now he was determined that such activities must be\nstopped. \"We've got to clean up this planet, and get it into the\nFederation. If they keep on this way, they can be a real menace. But\nwith this criminal activity wiped out, and Estrella a member of the\nFederation, we can help them so much--and they have a lot to teach us,\ntoo.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\n\nThe following day Hanlon continued working with his roches. He now\n\"drilled\" them as soldiers are drilled. He taught himself how to\ncontrol their minds in unison, making them march in all the various\ncomplicated maneuvers of squads and columns, all in perfect alignment\nand cadence.\n\nIt was tricky, delicate work, requiring as it did placing a portion of\nhis mind in each roch's brain, giving that mind and body individual\ncommands, yet keeping enough central control in his own mind so they\nall performed exactly together.\n\nSo much of his mind was transferred to theirs, that he had to learn how\nto make his own body \"stand at attention\" during these maneuvers, with\nbut minimum control over his own functions.\n\nHour after hour he worked with them, giving them fifteen minutes of\nrest out of each half-hour--and thus giving his own brain rest at the\nsame time. For this was tiring work for him, as well as for them.\n\nWhen dusk fell he stopped the training, saw to it that the roches were\nwell-fed and watered, then put them all to sleep. He dressed for the\nstreet, went out and found an eating place, where he did full justice\nto a good meal.\n\n\"One thing you've got to hand these folks,\" he thought thankfully,\n\"they certainly can cook, even though some of their dishes have a most\nunusual taste.\"\n\nIt had taken him several days to discover which native dishes he liked\nand could digest, for some of them almost made him ill, others had a\ntaste he could not stomach, but most of them were delicious--and Hanlon\nwas ordinarily a good trencherman.\n\nHis meal finished, Hanlon paid and went back to the drinking place\nwhere he sat, toying with a glass of mykkyl while waiting for Auldin\nand the others to appear.\n\nThey came in shortly, one by one, and Hanlon \"listened in\" on Auldin's\nmind as the chief mobster gave his fellows directions as to the places\nthey were to burn or wreck. Hanlon had already prepared a note,\naddressed to the head of the local peace-keepers. To this he now added\nthe addresses Auldin was giving. When he was sure he had them all, he\nslipped out of the little cafe.\n\nHe went swiftly along the streets toward the Stearra police\nheadquarters, which he had previously located, keeping watch until he\nsaw a dog-like roch running along. Quickly reaching out and taking\ncontrol of its mind, Hanlon made the animal follow him until he could\nduck into a deserted doorway.\n\nHanlon made his messenger take the prepared note carefully in its\nmouth, then trot down the street and into the \"police station.\" There\nit ran up to the man in charge, and raised itself up with its front\npaws on the man's knees.\n\n\"What in the name of...?\" the official looked down, eyes bugging and\nmouth slack at the beast's unexpected action. For several moments he\nseemed not even to notice the paper in the roch's mouth. When he did,\nhe took it gingerly, opened and read it.\n\n\"An attempt will be made just before half-night,\" Hanlon had written,\n\"to set fire to or wreck the following places of business. If you watch\ncarefully, you can catch the criminals in the act, and save these\npieces of property from damage or destruction.\" Then followed the five\naddresses.\n\nThe man read the note twice, a puzzled, anxious frown on his face.\nHe did not quite know what to make of it--or so his attitude seemed\nto indicate. There had been no \"crime\" on this planet that he had\never had occasion to try to stop. For he was not a police officer in\nthe ordinary sense. The Estrellan \"peace keepers\" merely watched to\nsee that crowds or individuals did not get too boisterous, aided in\nhandling crowds at large gatherings, or assisted home those who may\nhave imbibed too freely.\n\nThe fellow scratched the back of his head while he considered the\nmatter at length. \"Some phidi trying to make a fool of me,\" he finally\nsaid aloud, as Hanlon heard through his roch's ears, as he had been\nwatching through its eyes. \"But how in the name of Zappa did whoever it\nwas train this roch to bring me the note like this?\"\n\nThis latter problem seemed to have greater interest for him than the\nwarning. For his eyes were still watching the roch with puzzled\ninquiry ... but he did nothing about acting upon Hanlon's suggestion.\n\nAs the S S man watched the roch leave the peace keeper's headquarters,\nhe fumed because it was apparent that the official was going to take\nno action on his warning. Were they in on this criminal activity, he\nwondered? Was it that wide-spread, that even the supposed law-keepers\nwere party to it?\n\nNo, he finally decided, probably this fellow was just a dumb,\nunimaginative sort of dope.\n\nHe watched miserably as the fires were set and the business buildings\nwrecked. There was nothing else he could do to stop it, for he knew it\nwould only put himself in useless danger to try--would jeopardize what\nhe and the other secret servicemen were trying to accomplish here. But\nas soon as the damage had been done he found another roch, and sent it\nback to headquarters with another scathing note.\n\n\"You paid no attention to my previous warning, and as a result two of\nthe buildings I told you about have been set on fire, the windows\nsmashed on another, and two others have been wrecked by explosions.\nWhy don't you use what small brains you possess, and stop this wave of\ncrime? Or are you being paid to ignore it?\"\n\nThrough the eyes of the roch Hanlon watched the official read the note,\nand saw him fly into a rage and pace the floor ... but what the man was\nthinking Hanlon was too far away to read.\n\n\"One thing sure, I'll have to get busy and make contact with these\ngangsters,\" Hanlon thought bitterly as he went back to his room and\nto bed. \"Guess I'm near enough ready to tackle Yandor now. Let's see,\nshall I do it directly, or...?\"\n\nHe undressed and climbed into the low, foot-high, five-sided bed these\nEstrellans used. There was no mattress or springs, but fortunately his\nrooms had several extra blankets, and these he had folded beneath him\nto make his sleeping more comfortable.\n\nHe was still wrestling with his problem when he finally dropped off to\nsleep.\n\nBut the next day he figured it out to his satisfaction. He worked with\nhis roches until evening, then went out and got himself a meal. Later\nhe went, purposefully late, into the drinking place. Seeing Auldin and\nhis men already at their table, he went directly up to them.\n\n\"Greetings, Ran Auldin,\" he said boldly. \"I've been looking for you,\nfor I want to join your group. I'm fast and clever with knife or\nflamegun, and I've got plenty of ideas. I can do us both a lot of good.\"\n\nThe other three half-rose, staring at him with hostile eyes. But their\nchief made a gesture that said \"Wait\", and himself looked Hanlon up and\ndown coolly. \"You are mistaken, my friend,\" he said at last. \"We are\nnot engaged in such activities as might require the use of ... of knife\nor gun. We are lawful businessmen.\"\n\nHanlon fitted his face to a crooked smile and his voice was almost\nsarcastic as he replied, \"Sure, sure, I know. But listen, friend. A\nfellow out to make a big pile of pentas doesn't do it by being asleep.\nI've done a lot of scouting 'round and asking questions in a discreet\nway. I know who I'm talking to.\"\n\nHis mind, always in touch with that of the others, read in their\nsurface thoughts the surprised, \"Oh, so that's why we've had the\nfeeling the past few days we were being watched.\" He could tell that\nthis conclusion made them jittery, and more cautious and ready for\ninstant action.\n\nBut Hanlon had to keep on the path he had taken.\n\nAloud, Auldin merely said again, in a voice he kept mild and low, \"I'm\nsorry, my friend, but you are still mistaken. We work for another man,\nhelping him hunt out talented people and make entertainers out of them.\"\n\n\"During the day, yes,\" Hanlon gave him a wise smile, \"and I can help\nhim a lot in that, too.\"\n\nHe knew the three other men had been growing more and more angry at his\ninterruption. He could interpret their thoughts well enough so he was\ntensed for quick-action, determined not to be caught off guard.\n\n\"But what I'm really interested in,\" Hanlon continued, \"is your evening\nactivities. By the way, I hope none of you got hurt or burned last....\"\nHe wheeled swiftly, for one of the natives had suddenly leaped up and\ntoward him, a dagger in his hand, slashing at him.\n\nHanlon met him with a light, contemptuous laugh. He ducked beneath the\nother's knife-slash, then stepped in close. His left fist traveled only\na few inches, but all the strength of his powerful shoulder and arm\nmuscles was in the blow. His fist sank to the wrist in the man's solar\nplexus.\n\nWind _whooshing_ out, the gangster doubled up in pain. Hanlon chopped\ndown with the edge of his hand on the other's wrist, and the knife\nclattered to the floor. The Corpsman swung viciously with a right\nuppercut that lifted his attacker and drove him backward. He crashed\ninto a chair with such force that as man and stool fell to the floor,\nthe wooden seat was splintered.\n\nThe other two leaped to their feet and started forward. As though he\nhad eyes in the back of his head and had seen them coming, Hanlon\nswivelled toward them, his lips thinned in a fighting grin, while\nseveral of the cafe attendants were running up.\n\n\"Leave him alone,\" Ran Auldin commanded sharply, and his men looked\nback at him in astonishment. \"The stranger was only defending himself\nagainst an unprovoked attack by Ugen,\" Auldin explained to the cafe's\nmen. He turned to his fellows. \"You two take Ugen home and put him to\nbed. I want to talk to this stranger.\"\n\nAs the surly guards picked up the limp body of their fallen companion\nand bore him out, the drink-servers returned to their posts. Evidently\nRan Auldin was known and respected here. He now faced Hanlon and\nmotioned toward one of the stools.\n\n\"Sit down, my friend,\" he said courteously. \"Perhaps we can do a bit of\ntalking.\"\n\n\"No use for knives, eh?\" Hanlon grinned as he sat down. But immediately\nhe sobered. \"I figured maybe you'd be willing to talk, although I\ndidn't expect to have to slap down one of your boys to make you. I'm\nsorry if I hurt him.\"\n\nAnd Hanlon was sincere in this. He had momentarily forgotten that he\nwas on a lighter planet, with a gravity only about 90% that of Terra,\nand that consequently he would naturally be stronger than the average\nEstrellan native. While this would not have kept him from defending\nhimself from that sudden, vicious attack, he would have pulled his\npunches a bit had he thought. He did not like killing or injuring\npeople.\n\nBut Auldin was answering, and Hanlon knew he had better be on his toes\nand pay strict attention. There were undertones and concepts behind the\nspoken words that were hard for his Terran mind to interpret.\n\n\"You needn't be sorry,\" Auldin assured him. \"Ugen was useful, in a way,\nbut he's stupid. I don't especially like stupid people.\" He studied\nHanlon closely. \"I don't think you're stupid.\"\n\n\"I don't know it all, by any means,\" the S S man said with disarming\ncandor, \"but I never considered myself simple.\"\n\n\"Now, what makes you think we are engaged in anything ... illegal ...\nduring our evenings?\"\n\n\"Look, nyer, let's not you and me chase ourselves around a flowertree.\nIf I'm out of line, say so and I'll take a run. But since we're talking\nhere together, all peaceful-like, and there's nobody within hearing\ndistance if we talk low, let's put it on the penta, shall we, huh?\"\n\nRan Auldin looked at Hanlon another moment, his face and thoughts\nshowing puzzlement at the stranger's choice of words. Then he laughed\nquietly. \"By Zappa, I like you, my friend. What's your name?\"\n\n\"Gor Anlo.\"\n\n\"You're a cool one, all right. Where are you from? I've not seen you\naround Stearra before.\"\n\n\"No, I'm from Lura, over on the Eastern Continent. The goody-goodies\nare mostly in charge there, and there's no way for a hustler to make a\nfast pile. So I came here, hoping there'd be more chances for me. I've\nbeen here six-seven days, looking over the ground, and making a little\ninvestigation. The best leads pointed to your boss, Ino Yandor.\"\n\nAuldin started at that name, and while he was staring anew at Hanlon,\nthe latter's mind flashed back over that investigation. His first\nday had been spent getting the \"feel\" of the city through wide-open\nmental searchings. Not so much from individuals at first, but from the\nmass-thoughts of the many. He had later touched hundreds of minds and\nstudied them, trying to learn how to interpret those alien thoughts.\nHe had no trouble getting the thoughts themselves--it was what they\nmeant that puzzled and troubled him.\n\nNow, having noted the start Auldin made at mention of Ino Yandor's\nname, and the close, searching look the mobster bent toward him,\nHanlon continued quickly with an appearance of great intensity and\nseriousness. \"I figured that I could get to him easier through one of\nhis seconds in command, and picked on you.\"\n\n\"One of his...?\" Auldin started to ask, then quickly changed his mind.\n\"Because you thought I was more weak-minded?\" There was now a hint of\nanger in the cold eyes.\n\n\"Not on your life, Ran Auldin. Because I figured, after studying the\nset-up, that you were about ready to take over in his place one of\nthese days, probably soon, and that would put me closer to the real\npower ... and the big money.\"\n\n\"Hmmm, I see.\" Auldin was silent for some time, digesting all this\nin his mind. He was pleased at the compliment, but somewhat startled\nat two pieces of information Hanlon had so carelessly tossed out.\nOne, that apparently Auldin was not Yandor's chief or only \"second in\ncommand\" and, two, that this stranger had so quickly and easily divined\nhis secret ambition.\n\nHanlon, reading his mind, could discern and understand all this.\nAlso, he knew when Auldin began trying to figure out whether this\nnewcomer was legitimately on the make, or whether he was a spy sent by\nsomeone--perhaps even Yandor--to check up on him. That last statement\nof Hanlon's really upset him more than the first, which he had\nsometimes suspected. He worried about the latter now. It was the truth,\nall right, but he had not thought anyone else knew it or even suspected\nit. Did Yandor suspect it? If so, Auldin knew he was in for trouble ...\nbad trouble.\n\nHanlon decided it was time for him to do a little steering. \"Look,\nAuldin,\" he interrupted the other's somewhat frightened thinking. \"Why\nnot take me to Yandor and introduce me? Let him decide whether he\nwants to let me in or not?\"\n\nFor a long moment Auldin stared again at Hanlon, but when he finally\nanswered there was a note of relief in his voice he tried to conceal.\nYet he was not entirely convinced that this might not be all part of\nan espionage trick formed in the fertile but hellishly devious mind of\nhis superior, Ino Yandor. But Auldin was one who preferred to meet his\ndangers face to face ... when they could not be avoided.\n\n\"That might not be a bad idea,\" he said as calmly as he could. \"But\nlook, my friend. Don't try to play me for an easy fool. I'd do things\nabout it if you did.\"\n\n\"Sure, I know that,\" Hanlon's voice was bland and ingenuous. \"I'm not\nfiguring on your job--being a yunner I know I've got to begin low and\nwork up. A chance to get started is all I want ... for now.\"\n\nAuldin rose, took some of the five-sided silver pentas from his pocket\nand dropped them on the table. \"Fair enough. Come on.\"\n\nThe two were mostly silent as they walked along the narrow, unpaved,\ncrooked streets, past the not-too-tall, five-sided buildings of the\nmercantile establishments of this district. After a few blocks of the\nwinding, twisted streets--\"didn't these folks ever learn anything about\nsurveying?\" Hanlon often wondered--they turned down a tree-shaded\nresidential street. They walked past increasingly pretentious houses,\nwhich Hanlon knew were of the ubiquitous pentagonal construction so\ngeneral on this planet. It was this unusual type of buildings that\nHanlon found it hard to adjust to. The first day or two on this planet\nand in this city the odd shapes and crooked streets had so distracted\nhim he had trouble concentrating on his job.\n\nNow he looked interestedly at the almost-universal green-tiled roofs,\nand also at the gardens of beautiful but strangely-unearthly flowers.\nHe saw, too, the thick-trunked, low but wide-spreading flowertrees\nthat lined the streets and were heavily planted in most of the yards\nsurrounding the houses.\n\nHe tried, naturally, to see if these latter had any minds he could\ntouch--ever since knowing those plant-like Guddus this had become\nalmost automatic with him at sight of any new kind of tree, bush or\nplant. But he drew a blank here, as he had elsewhere. Those alien\ngrowths on Algon might be unique in the universe, he thought.\n\nHanlon was glad of Auldin's silence as they walked along. It enabled\nhim to get his own thoughts in order, and to try to plan as best he\ncould for this coming interview with Yandor, not knowing what to\nexpect ... except that it would undoubtedly try his abilities to the\nutmost.\n\nThere were some slight traces of fear in his mind, for he was, after\nall, still a very young and inexperienced man playing a dangerous game.\nBut his success in his first assignment--the dangers he had faced and\nthe victories he had wrested because of his unusual and growing wild\ntalent--thought of them brought back his self-confidence and with it an\nalmost contemptuous view of the dangers here. There was really nothing\nto fear after all, he told himself. But still....\n\nHanlon and Auldin came to a place in the street where it climbed a\nfairly steep hill--there were many such throughout this city--and\nwere nearly winded when they finally reached the top. Still wordless,\nthey were both glad of the chance to stop and rest a moment. Then\nthey started on again, along a much nicer part of the street, rapidly\napproaching the home of Ino Yandor.\n\nThis entertainment entrepreneur (that was, in effect, the nearest\napproach to a familiar profession of which Hanlon could think) was the\none the young secret serviceman's investigations had led him to believe\nwas the first rung on the ladder he must climb to find the knowledge\nthat lay at the top.\n\n\"Ah, here's the place,\" Auldin said at last, as they turned up a\nsort of cobbled walk leading to the fairly imposing residence. It\nwas an ornately-decorated, two-story house, pentagonal in shape, and\nwith a green-tiled roof, of course. The three sides Hanlon could see\nwere painted in different, though mutually complementary colors. The\nsurrounding lawns were made of the peculiar grass so general here, with\nits minutely-petalled flower-tips. There were also numerous beds of the\nstrange, native flowers, highly-perfumed, but not heavily blossomed\nexcept in the mass.\n\nHanlon thought he caught large numbers of thought-emanations from\nanimal minds of various kinds, but before he could investigate, Auldin\nspoke.\n\n\"One word of warning. Don't be too eager. Yandor may seem slow\nthinking and calculating, but don't make the mistake of thinking him\nstupid. And don't irritate him--he seldom shows his temper, but he is\ndeadly vindictive to those he takes a dislike to. But he is a good\nemployer--and generous to those who serve him well and efficiently.\"\n\n\"Thanks for the tip. I'll be on my good behavior.\" But Hanlon grinned\nto himself as he read the reason for that warning in Auldin's mind.\nIf this stranger was spying for Yandor, he would have to make a good\nreport on Auldin.\n\nThen, as the mobster used the ornate knocker, Hanlon tensed himself\nfor--literally--anything.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\n\nAfter a considerable wait the door was opened. By the light from inside\nGeorge Hanlon saw a fairly tall native, his hair and beard sleek and\nburnished from much brushing, and trimmed with unusual care. He was\nwearing a sort of slip-on gown of heavy cloth, probably a lounging\nrobe. Perhaps the man had already gone to bed--in which case he\nwould undoubtedly be quite provoked at their untimely call, Hanlon\nthought. Indeed, the man's face showed surprise and petulance at this\ninterruption.\n\nBut Hanlon could see shrewdness and a crafty trickiness inherent in the\nblack eyes, that caused an inward tremor. \"I'd sure better be on my\ntoes with this fellow,\" he thought.\n\nYandor scanned the two for a long moment, without a word, then beckoned\nthem inside. But as soon as the door was shut--and locked--he turned\nangrily on Auldin.\n\n\"Well now, what's the big idea, you stupid idiot, of coming here, and\nat night, and bringing someone with you. Are you trying to cross me,\nRan? You know that isn't healthy.\"\n\nRan Auldin cringed somewhat and made his voice apologetic. \"It's\nbecause it was night, nyer, and we wouldn't be noticed, that I came\nnow. Besides, I think this is important. I want you to meet Gor Anlo,\nwho's just come from Lura, looking for a chance, he says, to get into\nour businesses.\"\n\nAuldin slightly emphasized that last word, and Yandor's eyes snapped\nwide. He swung about and faced Hanlon, studying him carefully. The\nyoung man bore the scrutiny without flinching, a smile of greeting on\nhis face, but without a sign of boldness or brashness.\n\nAfter a moment Yandor motioned them into an adjoining room, and himself\nwent to sit behind a large, ornate, wooden table-desk. \"Sit,\" he waved\na delicate hand at the two chairs facing him in such a manner that the\ndesk-lamp's light was strong in the faces of the two, while leaving his\nown more or less in the shadows. Hanlon could barely repress a grin at\nthis--it smacked so intimately of the old Terran police-questioning\ntechnique.\n\nDuring the short moments they had been in the hallway, however, Hanlon\nhad noticed a small roch standing there, apparently one that Yandor\nmust have partially tamed and kept as a pet. Quickly the S S man had\ntransferred a part of his mind into that of the beast. Now, while his\nown body and nine-tenths of his mind were in that office room for the\ninterview with Ino Yandor, the other tenth, inside the brain of the\nroch, was making the animal roam the house, seeking whatever secrets it\nmight find there.\n\nThe impresario looked at Hanlon searchingly. \"Well now, so you think\nyou'd like to get into the entertainment business, eh?\" he said with an\nattempt at joviality.\n\n\"Yes, nyer, that ... and other things,\" Hanlon answered calmly. \"Back\nin Lura where I come from, sir, the people seem to be against the idea\nof a young fellow getting ahead in the world. So,\" shrugging, \"I came\nhere where I thought there was a better chance of doing myself some\ngood. Me, I'm out after a basketful of gold pentas ... and not too\nparticular how I get 'em,\" he added levelly, but in his eyes was an\nunmistakable message the Estrellan could not help reading correctly.\n\n\"But there are entertainment procurers on the Eastern Continent,\"\nYandor was sparring for time to evaluate this situation better. \"If\nyou have a good way of pleasing the people, they would be glad to take\nyou in hand.\"\n\n\"Anlo isn't stupid, Yandor,\" Auldin interrupted ... and Hanlon was\nglad he did at just that moment. For the roch had just peered through\nthe half-open doorway of a room upstairs, and found a man, probably a\nservant, lying there on the bed, apparently reading from a scroll.\n\nHanlon did not especially like this spying on anyone, but he _had_\nto learn all he could about what was going on here, no matter how he\ngained the information.\n\nSo he reached out and studied the man's mind. The fellow was not\nreading at the moment, he found, but was thinking of the \"payback\" he\nowed someone named Ovil Esbor, who had obtained this position for him.\nThis Esbor was much like a Terran \"ward boss\"--a minor politician, but\nconnected with many shady dealings. Hanlon had not previously heard\nthat name, but made a mental note to investigate the man further. He\nmight be another lead.\n\nThe S S man withdrew his mind after a bit, and sent the roch searching\nthe other rooms. He noticed quite a few animal pets about the house,\nbut thought nothing special of it at the moment. Meanwhile he, in his\nown person, began paying more attention to what Auldin and Yandor were\nsaying.\n\n\"... been in town several days, he says, looking over the situation.\nHow he found out I don't know, but he knows _all_ our businesses.\"\n\nYandor barely repressed a start of surprise, and his crafty black\neyes narrowed. \"Why are you spying on ... no, _who_ are you spying on\nus _for_?\" he demanded in cold tones that again sent a shiver down\nHanlon's spine. For there was no mercy or lack of ruthlessness in that\ntone. Nor in the man's attitude. Yet, at the same time, the young man\nrealized stunningly that Yandor, too, was as much afraid of _his_\nsuperior as Auldin was of Yandor ... and Hanlon knew after a fleet\nscanning of the gangster's mind that he now felt relief that Yandor\nhad not been investigating him through Hanlon.\n\nBut the young S S man had been reading the impresario's thoughts as\nbest he could, as well as hearing what he was saying. He felt that he\nknew now how to handle this agent.\n\n\"As Auldin said, I'm not stupid, and I am on the make for my fortune.\nI knew the only way was to check first and talk later. So I asked\nseemingly innocuous questions here and there--and I'm wise enough never\nto ask more than one from any one person. That way I found out a lot. I\ndo know something about the entertainment business and can hold up my\nend of the performance. But I also know the really big money is in the\nother things you control.\"\n\nYandor did gasp at that. His face grew black and he half-rose and\nopened his mouth to say something--but Hanlon beat him to it.\n\n\"Incidentally,\" he lowered his voice but still kept it penetrant as\nhe leaned forward confidentially, \"there's someone in the next room,\nlistening through that door there, to what we're saying.\"\n\nAt Hanlon's quiet words, Ino Yandor's eyes opened wide, while Ran\nAuldin barely repressed an exclamation. Neither guessed, of course,\nthat the stranger was looking through the eyes of Yandor's pet roch\nwhich, in the course of its investigation of the house for Hanlon's\nbenefit, had come to the open doorway of that adjoining room, and had\nseen the man kneeling there, his ear pressed against the door-panels,\nlistening intently.\n\nNow Yandor reached into a sort of pigeon-hole in his table-desk and\nquietly took out a flamegun. Tensing himself, he suddenly swung his\nchair about and leaped to the door. Flinging it open he found, indeed,\nanother man there, before that other could rise and run.\n\nGrabbing the spy's collar with one surprisingly strong hand, Yandor\nyanked him to his feet and into the light.\n\n\"_Ondo!_\" he exclaimed. \"Well now, what in the name of Zappa were you\ndoing?\"\n\nThe small man cringed. \"Pardon, nyer, I was ... was only trying to make\nsure that no one was attempting to harm you ... and ... and standing by\nto help you if they were.\"\n\n\"I think he's lying,\" Hanlon said, knowing from his quick probe into\nthe other's mind that he was. \"I'll bet he's a spy for someone.\"\n\nThis last, he knew however, was not correct. Ondo was regularly\nemployed by Yandor as a houseman. But he was one of those intensely\ncurious and inquisitive people who always try to find out everything\nthat goes on in any house they happen to be working in.\n\n\"By Zappa, you'll never spy again,\" Yandor's face grew livid. \"You know\nbetter'n to cross me. You know it isn't healthy.\"\n\nAnd before anyone could guess what he was about to do, the raging\nimpresario chopped down with the butt of his flamer, and Ondo fell\nunconscious to the floor, blood welling from a gash in his forehead.\nThe furious entrepreneur was swinging the weapon into firing position\nto kill the fallen man when Hanlon leaped forward and grasped his arm,\nholding him back.\n\n\"Wait, nyer. Don't cinder him,\" he said almost in a tone of command.\n\"It wouldn't look well for a man of your public position, if word of it\never leaked out.\"\n\n\"I say kill the snake,\" Ran Auldin spat. \"There's no sense taking\nchances with a man we know is a spy.\"\n\n\"No!\" Hanlon was still quietly determined to save Ondo's life. He\nspoke as impressively as he could. \"Such a killing, with a body to\ndispose of, would most certainly be traced back to you in time, nyer,\nand you would lose much of the respect the public holds for you. Your\nsuccess in your ... other ... endeavors is largely due to the fact that\neveryone knows you for such a high-principled, public-spirited citizen,\nthat no one suspects you of being anything else. Don't take chances on\nspoiling that reputation.\"\n\nYandor was swayed by this impassioned appeal, it was plain to be seen.\nHis respect for Hanlon's quick good sense and sound judgment mounted,\nand he looked at the young man with new interest.\n\n\"Anlo's right, Ran,\" he told his lieutenant. \"We mustn't have a killing\non our hands that can be so easily traced to us.\"\n\nHe turned back to Hanlon, who was grinning inwardly at Yandor's\nalmost-panic that made him forget for the moment that there were no\nreal police detectives on this world who could so easily trace back a\nkilling, especially if only ordinary precautions were used to dispose\nof the body.\n\n\"Well now, I thank you for saving me from the risk my temper might have\ncaused. What would you suggest we do with this ... this ...\", he pushed\nat the body with his foot.\n\n\"It's easy to see that Ondo is only a scared rat, and when he wakes up\nhe'll know he'd better keep away from you or he'll really be killed,\"\nHanlon spoke carelessly. \"Just have Auldin take him out and dump him on\nthe next street. Ondo will never bother you again, I'm positive.\"\n\nAuldin seemed about to protest, but Yandor forestalled him. \"That's\ngood advice. Take care of it, Auldin.\"\n\nAnd after the gangster had left the house with his burden, Yandor\nresumed his seat and motioned Hanlon to take the one he had formerly\noccupied. But while they were doing this, the young S S man had sent\nhis mind outdoors, found a sleeping bird and taken over its mind. He\nmade it follow Auldin, so he would know where Ondo's body was taken. He\nwould try to save the fellow's life if he could--he had got him into\nthis predicament, it was up to him to get the chap safely out of it.\n\n\"Well now,\" Yandor was saying, \"I'm beginning to believe you will\nbe a valuable man in our group. I'll think about it some more, and\nsee you sometime tomorrow and we'll talk further about it. But I'm\nonly promising to talk,\" he added hurriedly, \"I'm not saying what my\ndecision will be.\"\n\n\"That's all I could ask for now, for I know I can prove my worth.\" He\nrose and bowed courteously. \"So I'll see you at your place of business\nin the morning.\"\n\n\"You know where it is?\" surprisedly.\n\n\"But of course.\"\n\nAs soon as he was out of the house, Hanlon went carefully to the\nweed-infested vacant lot where Auldin had dumped Ondo's body. When\nhe saw the gangster returning, Hanlon quickly hid behind a great\nflowertree.\n\nHanlon had brought the bird back to Yandor's house, and now made it\nperch where it could look through a window. Through the bird's eyes\nhe saw the two inside, talking together for some minutes, Yandor\napparently very angry, Auldin on the defensive. Then the slender\nmobster slunk from the house, and started back toward the downtown\nsection. Hanlon made the bird follow him, to make sure Auldin was\nreally going home, and was not circling about to try to find out what\nHanlon was doing or where he was going.\n\nThen the SS man went to the vacant lot to find Ondo sitting up, holding\nhis aching head. Almost roughly he jerked him to his feet.\n\n\"Look, you phidi,\" Hanlon made his voice deadly menacing, \"I don't\nlike people who go around trying to find out about me and my business.\nYandor merely insisted that I see to it that you left town immediately,\nbut I'm not that soft-hearted. I'm going to kill you, then I'll know\nyou've done your last snooping.\"\n\nHe reached toward his pocket, as though for a knife or flamegun.\n\nThe man was a small, terror-stricken rat. But he was not entirely\nlacking in the universal will to live. Suddenly he half-stooped, then\njumped forward, his shoulder crashing into Hanlon's body. The young\nCorpsman could have maintained his balance, but he let himself fall, as\nthough he had been knocked down by the blow.\n\nOndo took off like a scared dara, and in brief seconds was out of\nsight. Hanlon waited several minutes, then went down the street toward\nhis rooming house, grinning to himself. He was happy that it could be\nworked out this way.\n\nHe was sure this Ondo would leave Stearra without delay. Hanlon's hint\nabout that was enough, he was sure--especially since he knew Ondo\nwas convinced that he would be killed out of hand if he ever allowed\nhimself to be seen hereabouts again.\n\nAs he walked swiftly along, Hanlon released the bird from its mental\nspell, for it was now apparent Auldin was really going downtown,\nor home. But before releasing the bird, Hanlon guided it back to a\ncomfortable perch in a tree, and put it to sleep.\n\nHe could not help feeling gratitude--yet still with an awed sense\nof wonder--about his ability to control animal minds. He remembered\nso vividly that day on the great spaceliner _Hellene_, when he had\ndiscovered this tremendous ability with the little puppy ... what\nwas its name...? oh, yes, Gypsy. And the still greater thrill when\nhe was experimenting later with the dogs on the kennel deck, and had\nfound that he could not only read their complete minds and control\ntheir nerves and muscles to make them follow his bidding, but that\nhe could also _dissociate_ a portion of his mind, put it in their\nbrains and leave it there, connected with the balance of his own mind\nmerely by a slender thread of consciousness, yet able to think and act\nindependently.\n\nBut it certainly came in mighty handy in his work as a secret\nserviceman, and he was thankful to whatever powers may be that had\ngiven him this ability to do these amazing things. Now if he could\nonly learn how to read and control the whole mind and body of a human,\ninstead of being able to read only their surface thoughts!\n\nBut he was trying to learn to be content with what he had, and to use\nit thankfully.\n\nYet he never ceased trying to learn more--to be able to do more along\nthese lines.\n\nFinally back in his room Hanlon grinned again to himself as he began\nundressing. He felt good. He had put it over again. He was sure he was\n\"in\".\n\nHe sat down on a chair and removed the special shoes he was wearing.\nThese native Estrellans were very man-like in shape as well as\nmentality, but there were enough structural differences so it had taken\nthe expert cosmetician many hours to fix him up to look like one of\nthem. These shoes, for instance, because Estrellans had unusually large\nfeet, were really shoes-within-shoes, to fit his feet correctly inside\nand yet appear large enough on the outside not to attract attention.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_In the spaceship high above, intent thoughts had been coursing through\nthe mind of the being. Finally, certain commands were impressed upon\nthe mind of the Estrellan native the being controlled, that would set\nin motion a new train of events._\n\n_The native cringed as those thoughts came into his mind. They were not\nthe kind of things he would ever consider, of himself. They outraged\nhis every sense of right and justice. It made him actually, physically\nsick even to contemplate them, and he wondered briefly how he had ever\ncome to get such ideas._\n\n_Yet something, he could not guess what, forced him to do them, despite\nhis every struggling, heartsick effort not to obey the commands he did\nnot even know were commands._\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\n\nAs SSM George Hanlon continued undressing, he recalled his parting with\nhis father on Simonides.\n\n\"How soon do I start?\" he had asked, boyishly eager, at the close of\ntheir interview. \"Right away?\"\n\n\"Whoa, son, not so fast,\" the admiral laughed. \"You'll have to have a\nseries of inoculation-shots against the Estrellan diseases. Then you'll\nhave to learn a lot, and especially, you'll have to be disguised to\nlook like a native, which isn't easy. Here are reels of the language,\ncustoms and geography. Get a room in the hotel here and sleep-learn\nthem. I think you'll find the language not too hard--it's a simple,\nuncomplicated one, outside of their habit of putting the verbs ahead\nof the nouns, and then the adjectives or adverbs. As to their way of\nthought--well, that's far different. Even with your ability to read\ntheir minds, I'll bet you have trouble in really understanding them for\nsome time. I'm not always sure I do, even yet.\"\n\n\"Tough, eh?\"\n\n\"That they are. You can't work them like you do humans--their concepts\nseem not at all like ours in so many things. We can get in serious\ntrouble through misunderstanding their apparently straight-forward\nwords. So go slow and easy.\"\n\n\"I'll watch for that, dad, and bone up on the rest as fast as I can.\nMeanwhile, how's about going out and wrapping ourselves around a couple\nof thick steaks--or some of that good _poyka_ at the Golden Web? I'd\nlike to see Hooper again.\"\n\n\"The grub I'll buy. But Curt isn't here--he's one of the boys working\nEstrella with me.\"\n\nThe lessons learned in time, Hanlon visiphoned Admiral Hawarden at\nBase, who sent the cosmetician to him at the hotel. The shoes had\nbeen only part of the job. There was the smock-coat, which Hanlon was\nnow removing in his room in Stearra. Estrellans had narrow, sloping\nshoulders, so a tailor had made special clothes--the coat almost like\na knee-length, slipover sweater only of a heavy cloth like homespun,\nwith shoulders whose cut and padding gave them the proper sloping look.\nThere was also the divided-skirt sort of pantaloons, that gathered at\nthe ankle.\n\nAs he undressed Hanlon looked at himself in the mirror, and grinned.\nTrevor had dyed his skin all over--not the dark red of Terran Indians,\nnot yet the black of negroes nor the brown of Malayans, but a sort of\ndeep pink. Hanlon had been warned not to take either tub or shower\nbaths, but had been supplied with a bottle of a special chemical.\n\nNaked at last, he scratched luxuriously and stretched hugely. He poured\na bowlful of water, added seven drops of the chemical, then gave\nhimself a sponge bath.\n\nAs he was washing his face he noticed with amusement the way his ears\nhad been built up with plastic to almost twice their natural size, and\nthe way his nose had been made so much broader--like a giant ape's it\nspread over half the width of his face.\n\nHe was careful not to pull off any of the hair that had been so\npainstakingly glued to his body to simulate the general hairiness of\nthe Estrellans. And, of course, he had neither shaved nor had a haircut\nsince being assigned this job, and his beard was growing nicely.\nBut it, and the body hair, was the most uncomfortable part of his\nimposture--the darned stuff itched, but bad. He scratched.\n\nAnyway, he thought thankfully, Trevor had really done a job on him. No\none yet met here had seemed to notice anything out of the way with him,\nas far as his looks went. He had easily passed everywhere as a real\nnative.\n\nA two-man speedster had brought him to this planet, and had landed\nhim just outside this city they called Stearra, in the dead of night.\nHis father, he knew, had preceded him by nearly two weeks, was here\nsomewhere, as were Manning and Hooper, the two other S S men assigned\nhere. A sneak boat came every two weeks, and stayed at a designated\nspot near the principal city on each continent from midnight until\nthree in the morning, in case any of the men wanted to send messages or\nneeded assistance of any kind.\n\nUndressed--and scratched--and washed--and scratched--Hanlon lay down\non his bed and gave himself up to thoughts of the coming interview at\nIno Yandor's office. He tried to analyze what he had learned and its\npossible connection with whatever it was that was keeping Estrella\nfrom joining the Federation of Planets; from becoming the fifty-eighth\nmember of that far-flung union of self-governing worlds.\n\nIt seemed to him he had made a good start--although he was slightly\ndissatisfied with the speed at which he was _not_ getting ahead. Yet he\nhad felt all along--and still so thought--that with his way of working\nhis best course lay through the criminal gangs of Stearra--that by\nworking up through them he would eventually come to the ones who were\nbehind all this. And he was sure this Ino Yandor was his best lead to\ndate, even though it seemed strange that an entertainment agent would\nbe the top man in the criminal world.\n\nHis father had not been too certain that this was a logical channel\nof investigation, but was quite willing to let Hanlon try it--the\nCorps _had_ to have that information, and each man of the secret\nservice should work the way that seemed best to him. Nor could the\nadmiral argue against Hanlon's insistence that this sudden rise of\nhitherto-unknown criminal activity just at this time was not purely\ncoincidental.\n\nBut the whole thing was such a seemingly insoluble puzzle. From his own\ninvestigation since he had arrived--from the \"feel\" of the city and\nits inhabitants to his sensitive perceptions--Hanlon knew the people\non the whole were such swell folks; the kind that would make wonderful\nFederation citizens, even if they did look so peculiar and animal-like\nto Terrans. Any race with a religion and a code of living based on such\ncommon decencies and high-principled honesties as theirs, was bound to\nbe a good one.\n\nFrom all he had been able to learn, Hanlon thought the Ruler, Elus\nAmir, a decent fellow and extremely capable. Amir certainly had shown\nby his actions all during his tenure of office that while their system\nof government was a sort of limited autocracy, that he, at least,\nwas trying to make it a benevolent one. Unless all the information\nHanlon and the S S had gathered was haywire, this Amir was certainly\nnot behind all this sudden opposition. He had seemed--especially at\nfirst--to be very much in favor of joining.\n\nThen who in the name of Snyder was?\n\nSuddenly a new idea brought Hanlon upright on the bed.\n\nWas Amir merely a tool--like the emperor of Sime had been under Bohr?\nWas there someone here who was comparable to that devilish Highness?\nSomebody with Bohr's brains and driving lust for power and ever more\npower?\n\nHanlon sucked in his breath in sudden wonder--and worry. Was this\nunknown another alien from the same, or some other advanced and\nfar-away planet as yet unknown to the Corps, working to take over\nEstrella and possibly--or finally--the rest of the Federated Planets\nand the whole galaxy?\n\nIt took Hanlon a long time to go to sleep... nor had he found the\nanswers to his puzzle when he finally did drop off.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen George Hanlon appeared in Ino Yandor's office just before midday,\nthe dapper impresario ushered his visitor into an inner room and closed\nthe door.\n\n\"I think Ondo has left town--or died. For I have heard nothing more\nof him, nor have any of my men. You were right about a killing that\ncould be traced to me being bad for my carefully-built reputation. Well\nnow, about your working for me. You said you knew something about the\nentertainment business. What can you do?\"\n\n\"Well, I can't sing or posture, and I'm not much good at acrobatics. I\ncan whistle a little, and....\"\n\n\"'Blow'? What is that?\" Yandor used his definition of the word Hanlon\nhad translated as meaning \"whistle.\"\n\nOh, oh. Hanlon knew he had blundered. In an effort to cover up he said,\n\"This,\" and puckered up his lips and whistled a few discordant notes,\nconcealing the fact that he was an excellent whistler, and could do\nperfectly dozens of bird-call imitations.\n\n\"No, I'm afraid that is nothing our people would care for.\"\n\n\"Then how about an animal act?\"\n\nThis was the crucial point. Hanlon had given a lot of thought to this,\nand had worked out the idea he thought might apply here. It certainly\nwould go big back on Terra, he knew, but he was not yet conversant\nenough with Estrellan theatrical acts--even though he had gone to the\ntheatre several times to study them--to know if these strange people\nwould like it or not. But he had to get in the good graces of Yandor.\n\n\"What sort of an animal act do you have in mind?\" the impresario asked\ndoubtfully. \"Our audiences are very particular. It has to be good, very\ngood, and unusual.\"\n\n\"I think they'll like mine,\" confidently. \"I have eight pet roches, and\nas....\"\n\n\"Roches!\" Yandor looked incredulous. \"You mean you've actually trained\nsome roches?\"\n\n\"That's right. I've trained them as a hobby. I drill 'em just like our\nRuler's residence guards do--and other things as well. I'm sure the\npeople will like the act. I'll bring 'em down and show you what they\ncan do.\"\n\n\"Well now,\" still hesitantly, \"that may be all right. It sounds most\nunusual, to say the least. I'll look at them, say, the day after\ntomorrow--yes, I think I'll have time then.\"\n\n\"Thank you, nyer. Then, after I've shown you what I can do about that,\nwe can talk about ... other things.\"\n\nThere was a flash of anger in the snapping, black eyes. \"Don't press\nme, Anlo. I go slow about things like this, and I'll want to know all\nabout you first.\"\n\n\"Sure, I know that. I didn't mean to hurry you--I just wanted to remind\nyou I was still thinking about the main thing, not merely about a\nlittle matter like being an animal trainer.\"\n\nHe left the offices then, and started toward home. But on the way he\nbegan thinking about that man, Ovil Esbor, he had heard mentioned. He\ntook a couple of hours out, then, to investigate many minds to see what\nhe could learn about the fellow.\n\nHe found that his initial information was correct--Esbor was a\nsmall-time, local politician, but was also connected with many other\nbusinesses about the city. He ran a sort of employment agency as his\nbusiness \"front\", but there were rumors that he was also a \"fence\" for\nstolen goods, a panderer and narcotics agent, and many other illegal\nthings.\n\nThese latter, however, Hanlon registered in his mind as merely rumors,\nnot facts, for he could get no direct evidence of them, even though he\n\"read\" about such things in many minds. But he was convinced that the\nman was one about whom he should learn a lot more, as he had time for\nsuch investigation. He felt sure that Esbor fitted in somewhere in the\nchain of criminals Hanlon was so sure was tied in with the group who\nwere trying to keep Estrella out of the Federation.\n\nHe went back to his apartment then, and to the training of his roches.\nHe was well satisfied with them--he liked them as pets, and they had\nlearned to like him. When he first came in they swarmed all over him,\nand all of them had a good romp before he got them down to serious\nbusiness.\n\nHe was also quite happy about the way things were going. He was putting\nit over again, for he felt certain that through Yandor he could get\nthe dope he needed on the higher-ups. Yandor had never even so much\nas denied that he had other irons in the fire than his theatrical\nbusiness. And from vague ideas Hanlon had seen in the man's mind from\ntime to time, he felt surer than ever that he was on the right track.\n\nThat evening he again went out for some fresh air. As he was strolling\naimlessly down the street he saw an elderly Estrellan native\napproaching. The fellow seemed very friendly, wanting to stop and\nchat--and Hanlon found himself grinning inwardly at the old man's\ngarrulous good nature, so like that of Terran elders, something he had\nnot before found here.\n\nThe young S S man touched the other's mind almost as a matter of course\nat the outset, and discovered that the man had lived in Stearra all his\nlife, but was now a lonesome old widower, all his family and friends\ngone on before him or moved away. Here was a good chance, Hanlon\nthought, both to be nice to an oldster and to get some more general and\nperhaps specific information.\n\n\"Will you do me the honor to have a drink with me, nyer?\" he asked\ncourteously the first time the old chap gave him an opening. \"There is\na very nice place where men drink close by.\"\n\n\"That's mighty kind of you, yunner, mighty kind. Don't many people act\nthat way to me any more. But there was a time ...\" his voice trailed\noff, but Hanlon read in his thoughts of the days when the fellow was an\nimportant and popular man in this city.\n\nAs they walked along the street to the drinking place, Hanlon listened\nwith half an ear to the old fellow's chatter, while he was thinking\nswiftly. It had not taken him long to learn that in this secret service\nbusiness he had to take information wherever, and from whomever, it was\nto be gained. And this old geezer ought to be quite a mine of gossip.\nHanlon hoped he could steer it into channels of real information.\n\nOnce seated at a small table, and their glasses of mykkyl before them,\nHanlon broke into the monologue to say engagingly, \"I've been in\nStearra such a short time, nyer, that I don't know much about it. And\nsince I intend to make it my home from now on, I want to know all I can\nabout things and people here.\"\n\n\"Heh, heh, you came to the right place for that, yunner. Where you\nfrom?\"\n\n\"I was born in Lura, over on the Eastern Continent. But I found there\nwas not much chance for a young fellow to make his fortune over\nthere--everything is owned by a few rich people who keep all the\nbusinesses in their own families. So I came here.\"\n\n\"Yes, you did right. There are plenty of chances for bright young\nfellows to make fortunes here in Stearra. Hey ah, I remember well ...\"\nand the old fellow started in on what Hanlon knew would be a long,\nuninteresting resume of his past life. So he interrupted with a\nquestion, or rather, a request.\n\n\"Please tell me who are the most important people here, and what you\nknow about them.\"\n\nFor nearly an hour he kept the old fellow on this topic, in spite\nof the innumerable lapses when the man started wandering in his\nreminiscences.\n\nOnce, when Hanlon had ventured to ask directly about Yandor, he learned\na very interesting fact that he gave considerable thought to when he\nwas back in his own room. This was the fact that the impresario was\ncrazy about animal pets.\n\n\"He has what almost amounts to a menagerie at his home,\" the old fellow\ncackled. \"Always on the lookout for new and unusual types and kinds.\nWhy, they say he even has cages outdoors, containing lots of wild\nanimals--even has them brought to him from the East Continent and the\npolar regions.\"\n\nHanlon remembered now, that when he first went to Yandor's house he\nhad seemed to sense many animal minds near him, but had not taken the\ntime to investigate. Also, that the roch had shown him quite an unusual\nnumber of pets about the house.\n\nSo, after Hanlon had bid the old man good night, the young S S man\nsettled himself in his most comfortable seat to consider this angle, as\nwell as the other things he had learned that night.\n\nActually, while great in quantity they had been meager in quality,\ntelling him little that he desired to know. The oldster had not known\nanything about any organized opposition to Estrella's joining the\nFederation nor, more particularly, who was behind it. Oh, he could\nrepeat glibly much of the propaganda that was making the rounds, and\nwhich Hanlon already knew. How, if Estrella joined the Terran planets\nit would lose its own planetary sovereignty, and become merely a minor\ncog in the great schemes of the people led by Terra, who were out to\ngrab the whole galaxy for their own ends of power and greed. That\nEstrella's people would have to conform to human standards rather than\ntheir own, and that their splendid Estrellan culture would soon be\nentirely lost. That they would end up by being little more than slaves.\n\n\"Why,\" he cried with genuine dismay and anger at one point, \"it is\nthose Terrans who are doing all the criminal things that have been\nmaking life here so dangerous recently--all those robberies, fires,\nmurders, and so on, that our people would never even dream of doing.\"\n\n\"Where'd you hear that?\" Hanlon queried sharply, aghast that his\nsurmise should thus quickly prove correct.\n\n\"Why, everyone knows that; everyone's talking about it,\" there was\nsurprise at his question. \"You mean you didn't know it?\n\n\"But it's true. That's the sort Terrans are. They don't even consider\nus real people,\" he added indignantly, almost crying in his drink.\n\"They actually think we are inferior to them--that we are just\nsemi-intelligent animals. Hey ah, how stupid can they get? They should\nknow we Estrellans are the highest form of life in the whole universe!\"\n\nHanlon knew this vicious propaganda was false, of course. He wanted to\ntell the oldster about how they actually worked with the primitive but\nintelligent races of other planets--what he, himself, had helped plan\nfor the Guddus. But, of course, he could not.\n\nHe could have told this old man that while the Corps and the Federation\nstatesmen recognized that the Estrellans were not as far advanced in\nsome sciences and technologies as were the Terrans and their colonists\non other worlds, they did respect these people as possessors of\nexcellent minds and abilities. That they readily acknowledged that\nthe Estrellans were far ahead of them in ethics and in ways of living\ntogether peacefully.\n\nHe could have added that these statesmen knew, and stated, that\nif the Estrellans wanted to learn the sciences and techniques the\nFederationists possessed, they could assimilate that knowledge in a\nvery short time. But, also, that the Federation would never try to\n_force_ their knowledge or culture on the Estrellans or any other\npeoples. That they never tried to make any of the less-educated or\nless-advanced beings of other worlds conform to any mold those people,\nthemselves, did not desire and specifically request be taught them.\n\nBut at the moment this other thought interested Hanlon more than a\npolitical review. So Yandor liked pets, did he? Well, how better get in\nhis good graces than give him one never seen on Estrella before? Hanlon\nwould get him a brand new animal, one far different from those on this\nplanet, where all the native animals were tailless.\n\nYes, and it would be one with a brain that could give Hanlon a real\nchance to see and hear what was going on in the man's private life when\nHanlon could not be near him.\n\n\"Let's see now, when's that sneakboat due ... hey, it's tomorrow night.\nThat's great. I'll be there to meet it.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\n\n_It was nearing dawn on the eastern Continent of Estrella, and high\nabove in the stratosphere, in its spaceship, the strange being that had\nbeen studying this planet so carefully, suddenly stiffened to closer\nattention. Its mind had just contacted a group of beings below whose\nminds were of a far different texture--finer, somehow--than those of\nthe natives of this world. The language was different, too, which\ndid not make so much difference. But the thought-processes of these\nnewcomers, in many cases, were almost incomprehensible to the alien._\n\n_What were they? Was there more than one race here on this planet,\nafter all? The being activated its multiphased scanners, and studied\nand pondered._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSSM George Hanlon was waiting in the shadows of the great forest\nenclosing the hidden clearing when the spacer came in. When it had\nlanded, the lock-door opened. Hanlon ran over and, after giving the\ncorrect password, was helped inside the ship.\n\n\"Hi, fellows,\" he greeted the two secret servicemen who were assigned\nas crew of this ship, and went with them into the control room. \"How's\neverything in the great big universe outside of this dump?\"\n\n\"Not bad,\" they grinned. \"Nothing special going on. Mars just won the\ninterplanet baseball championship....\"\n\n\"... and there's a new singer on stereo that's a doll, boy, a doll....\"\n\n\"... We saw Hoop and Manny at our stop on the other side, and they said\nthe admiral was coming here. We got some letters for him, but you'd\nbetter take 'em in case he doesn't show before we have to leave.\"\n\n\"Oke, will do. Hey, you fellows got any candy bars? Can't get sweets\nhere, and I'm sugar starved.\"\n\n\"Sure, plenty.\" And while one of the men went to the storeroom, the\nother asked Hanlon if he would like a cup of coffee.\n\n\"Gee, I sure would. That's another thing these folks don't have. That\nherb tea of theirs ... ugh!\"\n\nThe first returned with a dozen candy bars that Hanlon stuffed in his\npocket, and continued drinking his coffee.\n\n\"Oh, yes, better give me some Estrellan money. I've had to spend quite\na bit recently. About five hundred credit's worth should be enough.\"\nThey gave him that from a supply in a drawer.\n\n\"Now for the most important thing,\" Hanlon said. \"Next trip I want you\nto bring me a cat--a nice black....\"\n\n\"A cat?\" It was a duet of surprise.\n\n\"Yeh, a nice, tame, house-broken Earth cat. All black, or maybe with a\nwhite star in its forehead. About a year old, and quite large. Be sure\nit has nice, sleek fur.\"\n\n\"Can do, all right,\" doubtfully, \"but for John's sake, why?\"\n\n\"One of the men I'm working on here loves pets and collects all the\ndifferent kinds he can get. So I want to give him something he doesn't\nhave. All the animals here are tailless, so get me one with a really\nnice, long, well-furred tail. A thorough-bred, not an alley-cat. I\nfigure it will help me get in good with him.\"\n\n\"Right.\" One of them made a note. \"Anything else?\"\n\n\"Not a thing, thanks. 'Specially for the coffee and candy. Wonder when\nda ... the admiral will get here?\" He hoped they had not noticed that\nnear-slip, for it had been decided the relationship should not be\ngenerally told, and so far only a few S S men and high officials knew\nof it.\n\n\"Haven't the faintest.\"\n\n\"Then I guess I'll stick around awhile and see, if you don't mind.\"\n\n\"Glad to have you aboard, mister. We have to stay here several hours\nanyway, and we like company. Getting sick of old Tom's ugly face\nanyway,\" one of them quipped.\n\n\"Yeh, I 'spose you think you're a beauty queen.\"\n\n\"You play poker?\"\n\n\"Lead me to it.\"\n\nThough Hanlon carefully avoided using his special mental abilities,\nwhen Admiral Newton came aboard an hour or so later, the young Corpsman\nwas a few credits ahead. The cards had just fallen right for him.\n\nAfter the two secret servicemen had left the cruiser and it had blasted\noff, they started back toward town. Hanlon had very much wanted to see\nhis father, for he had been vaguely disturbed and dissatisfied with his\nrate of progress. True, he was making a good start at getting where he\nwanted to go, but it seemed to him he was taking far too much time for\nwhat little he had accomplished. He said as much to his father.\n\n\"Well, I don't know,\" the admiral said thoughtfully, as they rode along\nthe flowertree-shaded but dusty road. \"These things take time, and\nit seems to me you haven't done so badly, considering the short time\nyou've been here.\"\n\n\"Thanks for being generous, but I seem to be taking so long for next to\nnothing.\"\n\n\"What do you plan to do now?\" Newton asked, and Hanlon explained more\nin detail what he was after.\n\n\"What makes you so sure this fellow Yandor leads to the higher ups?\"\nthe admiral asked slowly at last.\n\n\"All the clues I've managed to pick up so far point to him as a key\nfigure,\" Hanlon said earnestly. \"I've read in a number of minds\nfacts--or snatches--that point to him as one of the leaders, despite\nhis reputable position as the leading theatrical entrepreneur....\"\n\n\"Or because of it,\" his father interjected.\n\n\"Yes, perhaps because of it. When Auldin introduced us and I hinted at\nmy knowledge of his 'other activities'--and when I've mentioned them\nsince--Yandor didn't react as I'm sure he would if he wasn't engaged in\nsomething off-color.\"\n\n\"Hmmm, it all sounds reasonable. And as far as the time it is taking\nyou is concerned, you needn't worry yet. It always takes time to open\nup a line of investigation. You took three months or more off to go to\nAlgon, remember, but you got the answers finally.\"\n\nThey had arrived at the house where Hanlon lived so they parked their\ntrikes in the back yard, and went up to his room.\n\n\"Yes, what you say is true,\" Hanlon seemed more relieved now. \"What\nhave you and the others found out?\"\n\nHis father's short laugh was not a pleased one. \"Hardly a thing worth\nmentioning. We don't even have any leads that may be successful, as you\nhave. Manning has been working as a clerk in a government office, but\ncan't find a thing. Hooper is in Lumina, the secondary capital where\nthe study and suggestion body holds forth....\"\n\nHanlon's mind remembered from the reels that this body was not exactly\na legislature or congress, since it had no power to make laws. It\nstudied all questions and problems that came up, and reported or made\nsuggestions to the Ruler, who had the final say. It was something\nfairly recent, introduced by Elus Amir.\n\n\"... and managed to get a job on an Estrellan equivalent of a newspaper\nthere. But he hasn't found a thing, either, except that he's been in\na position to learn where the propaganda is strongest, and is keeping\ncharts and graphs, with dates and percentages, of its spread. But so\nfar they haven't shown anything conclusive, except that the rumors are\nspreading rapidly, and that lately they have included the whispers that\nTerrans are back of the crime wave.\"\n\n\"Yeh, I've heard that. Obviously a 'whisper campaign' started by the\nreal conspirators. But what're you doing, dad?\"\n\n\"Mostly I'm just traveling here and there, keeping as quiet and\nundercover as possible, trying to find out what people all over the\nplanet are really thinking. The percentage who believe the propaganda\nseems very small, but is growing. About the only thing I've found out\nat all curious or extraordinary is that Adwal Irad, the Second-In-Line\nseems to have a much greater than ordinary place in the counsel and\naffections of Amir, the Ruler.\"\n\nHanlon laughed. \"That 'Second-In-Line' business is screwy, isn't it?\"\n\nThe admiral sat back in his chair, lighted a cigarro, and grew\nthoughtful. \"Yes, from our standpoint it is most peculiar, and one of\nthe things that make it so hard for us to understand the Estrellans at\nall well. How it is done I haven't been able to find out, but the men\nof the ruling class are specially bred--reminds me of the way queen\nbees are developed. They are larger physically, less hairy, and far\nmore brainy than the average males here. However, it seems to sap their\nstrength to handle the job, for while the new ruler takes over at the\nage of thirty, at the end of his fifteen-year term of office he is an\nold man--yet the average Estrellan life-expectancy is ninety.\" He shook\nhis head.\n\n\"Sure is alien all right,\" the younger S S man furrowed his brow in\nconcentration. \"Never heard of anything like it before.\" He was silent\na moment, then looked up. \"But what about Irad that's different--I\nshould think the rulers would want their successors to learn as much as\npossible about the job before they took over.\"\n\n\"I gather they do, but usually in a perfunctory sort of way. However,\never since he came back to Estrella--Irad was one of the natives who\nwent on that personally-conducted tour of the Federation--he has been\nwith the ruler almost every day. It is said the old man treats him more\nlike a son than a successor; they seem, from reports, to be closer even\nthan Amir and his own son.\"\n\n\"Aren't the two related?\"\n\n\"Not that closely. I believe Irad is a sort of second-cousin's son.\nThere's an examination among each generation of ruler-possibilities,\nand the high man is designated 'Second-In-Line', and so on down.\"\n\n\"What d'you 'spose it all means?\"\n\n\"Have no data yet. It could be something--or nothing.\"\n\n\"I'll keep Irad in mind, then, and watch for a place to fit him in. Oh,\nby the way, how long before he takes over?\"\n\n\"About two years, I think. Why?\"\n\n\"Just thought that might be important. I'll hunt around and find out.\"\nHanlon paused a moment, then continued slowly, \"but the more you tell\nme of what you and the boys have _not_ found out, the more certain I\nam that my way is best--for me, at least--and that I can get some dope\nthrough the gangs here.\"\n\n\"I'm willing to buy that now. I'll grant that whoever is back of all\nthis opposition may be, and probably is, using the criminals, and you\nmay get the first leads, at that. In fact, you already have more than\nwe have. But I think we'll find--if we ever learn--that someone far\nabove their level is the prime operator.\"\n\n\"You think there's a possibility it might be some alien--like Bohr was\non Simonides?\"\n\nHis father sat upright and looked at him penetratingly. \"I hadn't\nthought of that.\" Then he slumped down again. \"But I wouldn't say so.\nIt would really be stretching coincidence 'way out of shape for it to\nbe the same sort of set-up you found there. You haven't found anything\nto make you think that, have you?\"\n\n\"No, I don't really suspect anything of the sort--just can't forget\nhow surprised we were back there when we found out about Bohr.\"\n\n\"Well, we'll just have to keep on plugging. The campaign is so\nobvious--so open with all its use of pamphlets, spreaders of rumor, and\nthe same arguments everywhere ... it seems we certainly ought to find\nsome leads somewhere. But ...\" he shrugged helplessly.\n\n\"There's certainly a clever propagandist in the background somewhere.\nAnd he sure keeps well hidden.\"\n\nThe elder made a pained grimace. \"You can say that again.\"\n\n\"Say, I've got an idea. How about having Hooper or Manning, or bring in\nstill another SS man, to come here and let me brief him on what I've\nfound out about two or three other natives who seem to be up in the\ngang world? I've got leads on some others who are apparently lesser\ngang bosses, but I haven't time to follow them up and keep on with my\nother lines of investigation, even though I think they're important\nenough to study. Having someone else here to work on them would get rid\nof a lot of the criminal activity, I'm sure, and would leave me more\nfree to work on Yandor and his superiors. This Yandor is fond of pets,\nand the sneakboat's bringing me a cat next trip, and through its mind\nand eyes and ears I can watch him when he's at home, and so on.\"\n\nHis father stared at him in surprise. \"A cat...?\" Then he shook his\nhead with a helpless movement, but grinned feebly. \"You continually\namaze me, Spence. I hope it works out.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm sure it will. Yandor makes a hobby of animals, and anything as\nstrange and wonderful--to Estrellans--as a tailed cat he'll undoubtedly\nkeep with him most of the time. Especially after I impress on tabby's\nmind that it is to love Yandor wholeheartedly, and be very distressed\nwhen away from him.\" He grinned wolfishly.\n\n\"Sounds good if you can work it, and I am sure _you_ can. As to the\nother....\" He thought in silence for several minutes, then, \"I'll have\nManning come here and go to work with you. Being a government clerk, he\ncould pretend he wants to get into local politics, and it'll all seem\nnatural to the natives.\"\n\n\"Fine. One of the locals I suspect is a sort of political boss. I'll\nbrief Morrie on all I know, and suggest some things he can look into to\nstart with.\"\n\n\"And Hooper and I will check more closely into the gangs over on the\nEastern Continent,\" the admiral said. Then he leaned forward earnestly.\n\"We've got to solve this. At first it was merely asking a new world\nwith a high civilization to join us for mutual benefits. But now that\nthis opposition has grown so strong, if we fail here we'll have that\nmuch more trouble with other non-Terran worlds we discover. You know\nColonial has dozens of survey ships out all the time, and since they\ncracked that new-type drive of Bohr's, and increased our speed nearly\n300%, those exploring trips go both farther and faster.\"\n\n\"We'll get 'em, dad,\" and Hanlon got up as his father rose.\n\nAdmiral Newton was still not too optimistic. \"I certainly hope so.\nWell, keep trying, son, and don't get into any more trouble than's\nnecessary.\"\n\n\"I won't, dad. Safe flights,\" and the admiral left.\n\nAfter his father had gone, Hanlon sat thinking seriously, and trying\nto make plans. The roches, which he had kept asleep while he and his\nfather were talking, he awakened and fed, then romped with them for a\ntime.\n\nBut Hanlon was not really in the mood for play, even though he had come\nto feel a great affection for these fine animals, and they for him. He\nhad too much on his mind for such recreation just now.\n\nOne thing, he suddenly realized--the roches had brought it to his\nmind--he had been forgetting. That was the series of burnings and\nwreckings that Auldin and his men were continuing nightly. Despite his\nnotes to the local peace-keepers, Hanlon knew they had done nothing to\nstop these depredations, and it made him angry.\n\n\"What sort of dopes are those peacers, anyway?\" he growled to himself.\n\"Are they in on all this, too? They must be. And yet, I must remember\nthey've never run up against anything like this before and probably\nhaven't sense enough to figure out what to do. So, it's time I did\nsomething about it. But how? Should I try the same thing, or something\nelse?\"\n\nHe slept most of the day, making up for his wakefulness of the previous\nnight. When he awoke he considered his problem. Due to the fact that\nhe would probably be working his roches in public in a few days, and\nin a way he believed Estrellans had never seen them drilled or trained\nbefore, he was afraid that if he sent another note by means of a roch,\nas he had done before, someone in authority might be clever enough to\nput two and two together and not get five. So he decided to use an\nordinary messenger.\n\nAfter dinner Hanlon went again to the little cafe that Auldin and\nhis men patronized, but this time he did not go in. Having been in\ntouch with Auldin's mind so many times, he now knew its texture and\nindividual characteristics well. So when the mobster and his men went\ninto the cafe, Hanlon not only knew it but had no trouble \"hearing\"\nAuldin give his crew their assignments for that night's dirty work.\n\nHe had again prepared a note for the peace officers, and now he added\nthe new addresses to it. Then he went down the street until he found an\nEstrellan boy, to whom he gave the note, directions and a coin. The boy\nran to the peace station and gave the paper to the official there.\n\n\"We are giving you one last chance to serve the taxpayers and citizens\nwho support you,\" the note said. \"You paid no attention to the\nprevious warnings, but we are giving you the benefit of the doubt. We\nbelieve you simply did not know how to handle such a situation. It is\nsimple--send a number of men to each of the places listed below, and\nhave them hide and watch. Then, when they see the criminals come to\nstart their nefarious work, have them run out and arrest the men, and\nbring them back to your station. There they can be held for trial, by\nthe Ruler or someone he appoints. Now get busy, or else....\"\n\n\"Where did you get this?\" the official asked the boy after reading the\nnote.\n\n\"Some man gave it to me on the street, and gave me a silver penta to\nbring it to you,\" the youth answered, then ran out before he could be\nquestioned further.\n\nThree of the gangsters were arrested that night, but somehow--either\nthrough his own shrewdness or through someone's blundering--Auldin\nescaped.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_In the spaceship the strange being knew a feeling of profound\ndisquiet. It had followed the two of those strange minds that flew the\nspace-cruiser to its second landing place on this world. It had known\nwhen these beings met one and then another additional one of these\nunknowns who were not like the natives of this world. From the fact\nthat the first two came in a spaceship--which these natives did not\npossess--the deduction was simple that they were all from some other\nand unknown--to it--planetary system._\n\n_But one of these newest minds could not be touched at all! The\nscanning intellect knew only that such a mentality was there because\nthe first two (and later, a third) were so evidently holding a long\nconversation with someone ... and in its multiphased scanner the being\ncould see that that someone was apparently an Estrellan native._\n\n_Why, then, could not its mind be touched?_\n\n_In its scanner the two were followed as they returned to the city and\nto a dwelling place, and one side of their conversation was \"listened\nto.\" They were clearly, the mind was forced to conclude, a menace to\nits carefully-laid plans._\n\n_But why could that one mind not be read?_\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\n\nIn the morning, although still fuming about Auldin's escape, Hanlon had\nto put it out of his mind as he prepared for the try-out of his act\nbefore Yandor.\n\nThe new and gaudy uniforms had been delivered and the roches had grown\nused to wearing them. Now Hanlon dressed himself and the animals and\nleft the house. They marched down the street toward the downtown\nsection where Yandor's office was located.\n\nNaturally, the procession attracted considerable attention, for Hanlon\nmade the roches follow him sometimes in single file, then close up to\ndouble file. They always kept evenly spaced, all in perfectly cadenced\nstep. He, himself, strutted in a sort of drum-major's fashion, for he\nconsidered all this excellent advertising.\n\n\"Wish I had a brass band,\" he grinned to himself. \"Then these folks\nwould really wake up.\"\n\nBy the time he reached the more densely-peopled business section, a\nlarge crowd was watching him and his unusually-trained and dressed\ndogs, and comments were lively and pleasantly surprised. As on\nTerra--or any other planet, for that matter--this parade attracted an\never-growing crowd of excited children, who tagged along with laughter\nand shouts of joy.\n\nInto Yandor's office Hanlon and his roches marched, and at his brisk\ncommand they lined up before the startled entrepreneur's table-desk\nin a double rank of four. \"Salute,\" Hanlon said, and the dogs stood\non their hind legs simultaneously, and raised their right forepaws in\nsalute.\n\n\"Well now,\" Yandor gasped, \"what have we here?\"\n\nBut Hanlon, without answering, turned to his roches. \"Attention.\" The\nroches dropped to all fours, and aligned themselves. In rapid order\nHanlon made them do columns right and left, right and left turns, left\nand right by twos and fours, right and left obliques, and finally right\ninto company front. Then, \"Company, halt. Parade, rest.\"\n\nThe roches, who had obeyed every order with precision and unanimity,\nsank to their haunches and crossed their front feet.\n\nThe impresario had stood watching with open mouth and bugging eyes\nduring this miracle of training. Now he rushed up and seized both\nHanlon's hands.\n\n\"Well now, that's wonderful. Perfect. I've never seen anything like it.\nMarvelous. Can they do anything else, too?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" and Hanlon explained rapidly the various other things he\nhad trained his roches, individually and as a group, to do.\n\n\"Well now, we certainly can use this. The people have never seen\nanything like it. They'll be enraptured. Let's talk terms.\"\n\nHanlon faced the roches, who had not moved. \"At rest.\" They relaxed and\nlay down, although still keeping their places. Most of them hung out\ntheir tongues and panted in the manner of dog-like animals everywhere.\nNor did they move from their places during the half hour or so Hanlon\nand Yandor were talking business.\n\nAll during that discussion Hanlon carefully watched the mind of the man\nbefore him, paying more attention to any stray and extraneous thoughts\nthan he did to their talk about bookings--which actually did not\nespecially interest him. For he had begun to find that in those side\nthoughts of the natives during a conversation usually lay his greatest\nmine of information.\n\nHanlon was becoming more and more certain that this man Yandor had much\non his mind besides the entertainment business that was his front. He\nwas not able--yet--to get any direct clues as to who Yandor's superior\nor superiors might be, but he did glean enough to make him certain\nthere were such higher-ups.\n\nJust as they were closing their interview Hanlon said, \"I understand,\nnyer, that you have quite a collection of rare animals.\"\n\n\"Well now, that's right. I do have quite a number, and am always\nlooking for new and unusual ones.\"\n\n\"Do you happen to have a Terran _cat_ among them?\"\n\n\"A cat? What is that? I never heard of such an animal.\"\n\n\"Oh, but you must have one of those. They are not only the finest pets\nanyone could possibly have, but they have long, furry tails.\"\n\nA gleam of interested desire came into Yandor's eyes. \"I've heard of\nanimals with tails, on other planets, but I've never even seen one.\nWell now, such a thing would be most wonderful--a magnificent addition\nto my collection. But how can I get one?\"\n\n\"If you'll permit me the pleasure, nyer, I can get one for you. I know\na certain man on the Eastern Continent who obtained a pair when he was\non that trip to the Terran planets. Lately they have had a litter of\nkittens, as the young are called. I am sure I can buy one or ... or ...\nwell, I'll get you one,\" he grinned.\n\n\"Oh, I would so like to have one--though I hesitate to let you take\nsuch risks. But from you, my friend, I'll accept it. Well, yes, I'll\ngladly accept it from you. When can I have it?\"\n\n\"It may take some days, but have it you shall. I'll bring it as soon as\nI can. Meanwhile, where and when do you want me to perform first?\"\n\n\"Well now, let me think. The National Theatre would be best, I think.\nYes, it is the finest and largest here in the capital, and I'll make\na special presentation of your opening. I'll invite all the finest\npeople, including our glorious Ruler and his staff. Yes, three days\nshould be sufficient to arrange it all, if the Ruler is free that\nevening. Where do you live? I'll send you word.\"\n\nThe next three days were extremely busy ones for Hanlon--and he had\nlittle time for spying on the mind of Yandor, save when he saw him\nbriefly. Feeling in a way that he was being derelict in his duty,\nHanlon nevertheless decided that to gain the best results later he\nwould have to concentrate for the time being on getting ready for his\ndebut. So much depended on that being a success.\n\nHe had attended the so-called theatrical performances--more like\nvariety acts or what he had read that the old-time vaudeville shows\nwere like--since he had decided to make his bid for contact with Yandor\nby this means. Now he went to the \"place of performances\" to study the\nlayout more carefully and minutely.\n\nIt was nothing like the various types of theatres he had known so well\non Terra. For one thing, it was not in a building at all, but merely\na specially-prepared plot of ground, surrounded by a high stone wall.\nNaturally, being Estrellan, it was five-sided.\n\nInside the wall the hard-packed and smoothed ground sloped gently\ndownward from all sides toward a level, tile-floored, foot-high place\nin the center that was the stage. The customers stood during the\nperformance, although Hanlon had never been able to understand why.\n\n\"Sure seems as though it would be easy, and not too expensive, to at\nleast give them benches of some sort to sit on,\" he thought.\n\nNear one corner of the stage was the entrance to a flight of stone\nsteps that led downward into the dressing rooms and property-storage\nfor the theatre. When it was their turn, the actors had to come\nup these steps and so onto the stage to begin their turn, without\nbenefit of curtain. Also, because of the peculiar construction it was\nimpossible to use \"backdrops\" or \"sets\" as Hanlon knew them.\n\nThe morning Hanlon went to investigate the place there was no one\naround, so he was not stopped nor disturbed while he made a complete\ntour of the underground rooms, and stepped off the measurements of the\nstage. One great lack amused him.\n\n\"What?\" he chuckled, \"no popcorn or soft drink dispenser robots?\"\n\nHe had noticed when attending previous performances, that they used no\ntype of footlights or other illumination whatever, and that it was hard\nfor those in the back of the enclosure to see what was going on down\nin the center. By judicious inquiry he found that on the nights when\nit stormed or was cloudy, or when Estrella's two moons were not in the\nsky, there was no performance.\n\nFollowing his inspection of the theatre, Hanlon went to the market\nplace again. He hunted out a stall where lamps were sold, and after the\nusual considerable haggling and dickering, bought twenty of the most\npowerful of the peculiar carbide lamps at a fairly reasonable price.\nThen he hunted up a metal-worker, and had reflectors made to his order\nand specifications, and fitted to one side of the lamps.\n\n\"I'll introduce 'em to something new,\" he grinned, then was suddenly\nworried. \"Or are such new customs and innovations taboo on this screwy\nworld?\"\n\nAnother thought occurred to him the second day, and he hunted around\nfor some time until he found a place where masks were made. The\ncustomer, who specialized in things for actors, did not have what\nHanlon wanted, but after it had been described, the merchant said it\nwould not be hard to make, and that it could be delivered the next\nafternoon. So Hanlon ordered a face-mask for himself, that would look\nlike the head of a roch.\n\nMeantime, he continued working with the animals whenever he had time.\nHe was now well satisfied with his ability to control them under all\ncircumstances. He felt sure he would have no trouble in \"putting on a\ngood act\", and his only worry was whether or not he could please these\nstrange people. For so much depended upon his making good--if he did,\nhe would be more solidly in the good graces of the impresario, Yandor.\nAnd that was the main thing he was after right now.\n\nThe night of Hanlon's first performance finally arrived--and so did\na nice large attack of stage-fright. There were \"butterflies in his\nstomach\", and he was by turns wet with sweat and almost petrified.\nPeeking out from the top of the stairs leading to the dressing rooms,\nthe sight gave Hanlon a prime case of the jitters. For it seemed all\nthe high officials, business and professional men, and the \"social\ngroup\" of Stearra, with their wives and families, were there. Even the\nRuler was seated at stage-side in a large, ornate throne-chair, having\nbeen persuaded by Yandor that he would see something most exceptional.\n\nHanlon went slowly down into the cubicle assigned him and the roches,\nand there fought for calmness. And it was a measure of his innate\nstrength of character that he succeeded. The jitters passed, the\nbutterflies went into hibernation, and his nerves calmed down.\n\nThe first acts were the usual type seen on Estrellan stages--singers,\nposturers (they did not seem to have any dancers in the sense that\nTerran theatres do), and acrobats. Hanlon had always been interested\nin these, for almost none of the things they did were like what he was\nused to seeing or hearing.\n\nThe music, however, he could not get used to. Estrellan music was\nbased on a five-toned scale, of course, and was--to his ears--more of\na cacophony than Chinese music. Yet the Estrellan singers had clear,\nbeautiful, flutelike voices.\n\nThe footlights that Hanlon had finally persuaded Yandor to have set\nin place around the edge of the stage, and lighted, occasioned great\ncomment at first. But once the performance started, and the people\nfound how much better they could see, were acclaimed as a great\nachievement.\n\n\"How did you ever happen to think of them?\" Yandor had asked when\nHanlon first spoke of them and showed the impresario what he had made.\n\nHanlon shrugged. \"I always feel cheated because I can't see better when\nI go to a performance,\" he said. \"When I got to thinking of my act, I\nknew it wouldn't show up well if people couldn't see clearly exactly\nwhat my roches were doing. So I figured out these lights. Don't you\nlike the idea?\"\n\n\"Well now, yes, I like them. But I don't know. People are peculiar\nabout change. They may do something about it if they don't approve of\nthem.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Hanlon made a nonchalant gesture, \"we can always turn 'em off\nif they yell.\"\n\nBut after the first few moments, when the customers had seen how much\nbetter they could watch the posturer who came on first, the value of\nthe footlights was clearly seen, and they gave their whole-hearted\napproval. A new custom was born on Estrella.\n\nHanlon had been below in the cubicle assigned him and his roches, so\nhad not seen nor heard the crowd's reactions to the acts that preceded\nhim. When it came his turn to go on, he was glad to find that his\nnervousness was gone, and that he was perfectly calm.\n\nYandor stopped him near the head of the stairway leading up from\nunderground, while the native who was manager and a sort of master or\nannouncer of acts, made a brief speech.\n\n\"Nyers and nyas and you, most gracious k'nyer,\" he addressed the\nthrong and the Ruler, \"tonight you are to see something most unusual\nin trained animals. I have been connected with performances for many,\nmany years, but never have I seen anything to equal this. I will not\nattempt to tell you what is coming--you must see and marvel and judge\nfor yourselves. Next on our program is Gor Anlo and his Friends.\"\n\nHanlon came up the stairway and onto the stage, followed in single line\nby his eight roches. There was a titter of laughter at first sight of\nHanlon in the roch-mask and the dogs in their gaudy uniforms, but this\nsoon quieted in amazed surprise at the exhibition they were witnessing.\n\nAcross the entire stage-place the roches marched, while Hanlon took his\nplace in the center. He did not utter aloud a single word of command\nas the eight roches marched about the platform and stopped in a circle\nfacing the audience on all sides, all the dogs equidistant from the\nothers. As one they rose on their hind legs, and their forepaws bent to\ntheir heads in a salute.\n\nA moment they held this, then still without a spoken word of command,\ndropped to all fours and in rapid succession formed and marched in\ncompany front and lines of two and four, made left and right turns,\nmarched across the stage in oblique lines, did about face and to the\nrear, and all the complicated maneuvers the Ruler's residence guards\ndid on the parade ground.\n\nThen they added some things Hanlon had never seen Estrellan guards do,\nbut which were more or less common to Terran drill teams. They did full\nwheels in lines of eight and four, formed wheeling stars and circles.\n\nNever once did Hanlon utter a word of command that anyone could hear;\nnever once did the roches falter or break that perfectly-cadenced step;\nnever once was one of them out of line. There was never any hesitation,\nnever any breaking of ranks even when, about half-way through their\ndrill they changed to quick time--almost double the cadence in which\nthey had first drilled.\n\nHow could any of that great, stunned audience guess that the\ntrainer was actually controlling each animal mind, that his own mind\nwas divided and parts of it superimposed on each animal brain, so\nthat it was impossible for them to act counter to his central--yet\nindividual--command?\n\nAll the audience could see was the most perfect, the most incredibly\nflawless precision of training they had ever witnessed. Led by the\nRuler they began a rhythmic chant of \"Yi, yi, yi, yi,\" in cadence with\nthe roch's marching tempo. The chant grew louder by the moment until it\nwas a deafening roar.\n\nAt their first sounds Hanlon almost lost his poise--for he did not know\nthat this was their method of giving highest applause--and that very\nfew acts ever received it at all. He had never heard it when he had\nattended their performances before. To him, now, it sounded more like\nthey were giving him earthly \"boos\", and he was afraid he had somehow\noffended them.\n\nHe withdrew part of his mind from each of the roches, even as they\nwere marching across the stage, and sent it out to contact the mind of\nthe Ruler and several others. He was pleasantly surprised at what he\nread there, for it was not dissatisfaction, but a combined wonder and\ndelight at what they were seeing.\n\nQuickly he again sent full measure of his mind into each of his roches\nto continue the drill--nor had anyone noticed any break in their\nroutine during the second or so of this mind-searching.\n\nFinally, after a full five minutes of this, Hanlon silently commanded\neach one, in unison, \"Company, halt. Right, dress. Parade, rest.\nSalute.\"\n\nHe himself came to a stiff salute, his directed at the Ruler. Higher\nand still louder grew the chanted roar. Even the Ruler sprang to his\nfeet, his sounds of approval nearly as loud and unrestrained as the\nrest.\n\nWhen the noise subsided a bit, Hanlon gave the roches \"At rest,\" and\nthey relaxed, lay down, and panted ... but each still in his place.\n\nHanlon stepped forward and facing first one way and then the other\nsaid, \"Thank you for your kind reception of our poor efforts. Now,\nwith your permission, I would like to show you some of the individual\nabilities of my little friends.\"\n\nBut while he was speaking four of the animals had gone off to the side\nnear the entrance to the stairway. Hanlon had fixed up a specially\nprepared chair. To the bottoms of each of the legs he had affixed light\nwooden rods that extended out several inches. Now the four roches each\npicked up a rod in its teeth and thus lifted the stool, which they\nbrought out and set before Hanlon. He looked down at them in pretended\nsurprise, then out at his audience, and smiled. \"My friends are so\nthoughtful. They must think I am tired and need a rest. Well, far be\nit from me to disappoint them.\" And he sat down, while the roches went\nback to their places and lay down.\n\nInstantly there was a loud, angry hissing from the audience. There was\nno mistaking this--it was censure, not praise. Hanlon was dumb-founded.\nWhat had he done wrong?\n\nQuickly he scanned a number of minds, and found he had broken one\nof their most sacred taboos. Nobody--but _nobody_--ever sat in the\npresence of their beloved Ruler without his express invitation.\n\n\"Oops, tilted!\" Hanlon groaned, quickly rising and shoving the\noffending stool off the edge of the stage. But the audience was not\nmollified. If anything, their clamor rose louder.\n\nIt was the Ruler, himself, who quieted them. He rose and held up his\nhand in a gesture of silence, smiling forgivingly.\n\n\"Boy, what a swell egg he is,\" Hanlon mentally wiped the sweat from his\nmind's brow. \"I still don't understand these folks. I'll have to watch\nmyself more carefully, all the time.\"\n\nHe bowed his thanks to the Ruler, spreading his hands in a gesture of\napology. Then he quickly made the roches begin their other tricks.\nHe had one do some acrobatics, in imitation of the type their native\nacrobats did. Two of the others \"danced\" together. Another balanced\nhimself and rolled about the stage on a large plastic ball Hanlon\nhad secured. Three of them did intricate circlings about each other,\nwithout ever getting in each other's way or breaking step at any time.\nAnother stood on its hind legs and \"sang\" in imitation of the singers.\nAnother \"walked\" on its front legs. These, being more to the liking of\nhis audience, yet something they had never seen animals do, or so well,\nsoon recaptured their interest. After a bit they began again that \"Yi,\nyi\" of applause. By the time Hanlon's turn was over the people seemed\nto have forgotten his one blooper, and were solidly \"with him.\" As he\nleft the stage and went below with his roches, their yells were the\nloudest yet.\n\nIno Yandor was wildly enthusiastic, and those who had seen the first\nnight's performance spread the word. In days the fame of Hanlon and\nhis roches had spanned the continent, and other cities were clamoring\nto see his act, while the National Theatre there in Stearra was packed\nnightly with capacity crowds.\n\nDuring those days Hanlon spent as much of his time as he could\nwandering about the city, the marketplace, the recreation parks, and\nsitting in various places where people ate or drank. With his mind he\nwas hunting not only for whatever points of specific information he\nmight glean, but also to get a more general and better \"feel\" of the\npeople and conditions here.\n\nHe was confirmed in his early beliefs that as a whole these were\nwonderful people; that they would make excellent citizens of the\nFederation. They had such a high sense of social justice; such deep\nfeelings of right and wrong; such splendid habits of co-operative\nliving. More even than the Terrans and the colonists, who had come\nfar along the road of brotherliness in the past centuries, these\nEstrellans had an innate belief in the brotherhood of man.\n\nWhat a great gap there was between the great mass of Estrellans and\nthose few criminals with whom he was working? He remembered one time\nwhen he had been talking with his father about the way he worked.\n\n\"You want to be mighty careful,\" Admiral Newton warned. \"Being around\ngangsters and criminals so much, you'll have to watch not to begin\nthinking like they do.\"\n\n\"You never need worry about that, dad,\" Hanlon had been very earnest.\n\"The more I see of 'em, the less I like 'em, and the more I'm sure the\ncommon decencies of life are best. We must have law, government and\norder, and all decent citizens must always 'live and let live'. I could\nnever be contented otherwise.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\n\nThe night the sneak boat was due to return, Hanlon early sent word\nto Yandor that he was ill, and could not perform that night. The\nentrepreneur came, boiling over with anger, to Hanlon's rooms.\n\n\"Well now,\" he began, \"what's all this about...?\"\n\n\"Ooh, quiet, please,\" Hanlon moaned. He had been ready for just some\nsuch thing, and was lying in bed, face contorted with pain, and now\npressed his hands to his ears as though Yandor's loud voice was more\nthan he could stand. \"Can't you see I'm sick? Why must you make so much\nnoise?\"\n\nThe agent was taken aback by this counterthrust. He calmed a bit then,\nbut asked many questions. Hanlon's partial answers and evident pain\nfinally convinced the impresario that his star performer was, indeed,\ntoo ill to appear.\n\n\"These attacks come only once or twice a year, and usually last only a\nday or two,\" Hanlon assured him in a weak voice. \"I'll try my best to\nbe on hand tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Very well, I'll expect you then. Well now, there is something I've\nbeen meaning to talk to you about, and now is a good time. I want you\nto work into your act various things to say against the Terrans; about\nhow such wonderful performances as yours would be impossible if we were\nto submit to them and accept their so-called invitation to join their\nFederation. Suggest to the audience that we would all become slaves,\nand that neither would performers have time to prepare their acts, nor\nwould the others be allowed to come and watch them.\"\n\nHanlon was slightly prepared for this because he had seen it forming in\nYandor's mind, but he did not like it any the better. He was just about\nto make an angry retort when he took himself in hand, and continued\nkeeping in the character he had assumed. He groaned a bit louder, and\ntwisted more violently on the bed.\n\n\"Please, nyer, leave me now. I hate for anyone to see me while I'm like\nthis. As for what you've just said, we'll talk about it later and see\nwhat can be worked out.\"\n\nAnd, reluctantly, it seemed, Yandor finally left.\n\nWhen night at last brought its cloak of darkness, Hanlon put the roches\nto sleep and slipped quietly from his room. Down in the back, though,\nhe could not seem to get his tricky acetylene-powered engine to start.\nHe fussed and tinkered for nearly two hours before he could finally get\nit going.\n\n\"So help me, I'm never going to cuss out a real ground-car after this\nbecause it acts up occasionally,\" he said as he rode out of the yard\nand down the dusty street. He drove as fast as he could out to the\nclearing where the sneakboat had already landed.\n\n\"Sorry to be late, fellows,\" he said as soon as he had given the\npassword and been allowed aboard. He accepted gratefully the cup of\ncoffee they gave him, and griped for five solid minutes about those\ngosh-awful excuses for transportation these so-and-so natives used.\n\n\"Here, have a box of candy bars, and quit belly-aching,\" one of\nthem said at last. The other held out another gift, a pound can of\npulverized instant coffee.\n\n\"Hey, these are wonderful,\" Hanlon's spirits rose as if by magic. \"You\nguys are my friends for life.\"\n\n\"Why, Georgie,\" one of them simpered. \"I didn't know you cared.\"\n\n\"You'll have to choose between us, though,\" the other said owlishly.\n\"I'm not going to be a partner to bigamy.\"\n\nThen they both laughed. \"Look, he's blushing.\"\n\n\"Aw, I am not,\" Hanlon spluttered. \"It's just this pink skin-dye,\" he\nadded weakly.\n\n\"Anyway, here's your cat,\" the S S men got down to business, and\nfetched the crate containing the beautiful animal. \"We happened to\nremember hearing that these people don't have milk, so we got you one\nthat's accustomed to a meat and vegetable diet.\"\n\n\"Gee, thanks for that. I'd completely forgotten that point.\"\n\nHanlon examined the big, black cat, and his mind reached out and\nquieted its fright at the strange surroundings and this hairy being who\nwas now handling it.\n\nHe talked with the men for some further time, told them he had not yet\ngot any sure clues, but was beginning to get an \"in\" with some people\nhe felt sure would lead him to some. They told him the other three men\nhad reported about the same, although Hooper said the curve was rising\nsteadily on the belief that Terrans were behind the crime wave here.\n\n\"Yeh, I've heard that bilge, too. It's just another of the things we'll\nhave to stamp out before we can win out here. But we will.\"\n\n\"Sure you will,\" the two agreed. \"Anything else you need?\"\n\n\"No, can't think of a thing. The cat was the most important for now. It\nwill really get me in more solid with Yandor, the guy I'm working on.\"\n\n\"Hope so, Han. Well, cheerio.\"\n\n\"Safe flights, you guys, and thanks again.\"\n\nOn the ride back he was glad he had a tricycle instead of a two-wheeled\nbike, for the crate was heavy and rather awkward with the cat in it,\nshifting its weight about from time to time.\n\nBack in his room once more, Hanlon released the animal, which\nimmediately dived under the bed, where it cowered in fright, having\nseen and smelled the roches who were sleeping in various places about\nthe rooms.\n\nBut again Hanlon reached out and touched its mind, calmed its fear, and\nsoon had it out of hiding and creeping into his arms. It lay there,\npurring, while he stroked it and impressed on its mind--whose texture\nhe learned while doing this--that it was safe and with friends.\n\nAfter he had done that, he woke the roches. At first sight of the\nfeline a couple of them started toward it in curiosity. Swiftly\nHanlon took over their minds and halted them where they were. He then\nbrought each of them to the realization that this was a new friend and\nplaymate. That was not too hard, for the roches had never seen a cat,\nand only its strangeness had made them curious.\n\nHe had more trouble with the cat, for the ages-old dislike and fear of\ndogs was strong within it. But he finally calmed it by implanting the\nknowledge firmly in its mind that these strange beings were not dogs,\nactually, and that they meant it no harm, and all were to be friends.\n\nSoon he was grinning at his ability, as he saw the nine animals eating,\ndrinking and playing together, as though they had been the best of\ncomrades all their lives.\n\n\"I'm really quite an animal trainer,\" he chuckled to himself as he\nwatched them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_High above the strange being lay on its padded bench and frustrated\nthoughts ran through its mind. It had noticed the two DIFFERENT minds\nwho again had come briefly to this planet in their ship of space,\ntalked with the three other different ones, and then had come to this\nwestern continent in its night time. The mind \"heard\" them conversing\nwith that other but unreadable mind again, but still no sort of contact\ncould be made. Why? it wondered again. What sort of mind was it, that\nit could not be touched?_\n\n_Through its multiphased scanner the being carefully watched that\nentity below which appeared so like an Estrellan native--but after\nit had left on that peculiar conveyance, bearing a container with a\nstrange animal, sight of the entity had been lost among the crowds of\nthe city streets._\n\n_So now the mind above seethed with questions, to which it could find\nno logical answers, even though it was beginning to understand the\nthought-concepts of those others it could \"read.\"_\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLate the next day--for Hanlon had quickly adopted the actors' habit of\nbeginning his day at noon--he fed and watered his animals, then got his\nown meal and ate it.\n\nThen he impressed on the minds of his roches that they were to behave\nthemselves, and not destroy things about the room in their play, and\nnot to make too much noise.\n\n\"Sure is handy to be able to do this,\" he smiled. \"Boy, what a baby\nsitter I'd make if I could control humans this way.\"\n\nHe called the cat to him, snapped on the harness and leash the S S men\nhad brought with it, and took it down to Yandor's office.\n\nHe had worked carefully on the cat's mind, and knew the characteristics\nand texture thoroughly. He had practiced seeing through its eyes\nand hearing through its ears under all conditions--from ordinary\ndaylight to bright carbides, from dusk to the blackness of a closet.\nHe felt certain he could use the animal as planned, under any and all\nconditions.\n\n\"This is 'Ebony',\" he explained to Yandor as he presented the cat. At\nthe same time he was impressing on the feline's mind that this was\nto be its new master, that it must always obey him, and must allow\nitself to be the man's constant pet and companion without hesitation or\nanimosity.\n\n\"'Ebony',\" Hanlon went on saying to Yandor, \"is the Terran word for\n'black', and that is probably why its former owner gave it that name.\"\n\nThe impresario took the big, beautiful animal in his arms and\nexclaimed over and over at its wonderful appearance, its sleek lines,\nsoft fur and intelligent face. But it was the cat's long, furry tail\nthat was his greatest delight. He stroked and petted it as though he\ncould not really believe such a thing was true. Hanlon was careful to\nexplain to Yandor how he must stroke _with_ the lay of the fur, and\nnever _against_ it.\n\n\"Well now, I can never thank you enough, my friend, for this marvelous\ngift,\" Yandor said. \"I hope it didn't cost you too much.\"\n\nHanlon made himself cough in an embarrassed manner. \"Well ... er ...\nit really didn't cost me ...\" he grinned and left it at that, nor did\nYandor, after a knowing look, refer to the matter again.\n\nInstead, he said, \"It shall be the prize of my collection. I shall\ntreasure this above all others.\"\n\nYandor really was in the transports of delight, known only to\ncollectors who have made an unusual find. Hanlon read from the surface\nof his mind the thought that this man was a wonderful friend, \"and\nprobably no menace to our plans at all. I am sure we can trust him--and\nuse him.\"\n\nThe latter phrase delighted Hanlon, although he was careful not to let\nhis feelings show in his face. This was what he was after. He had only\nto learn who \"we\" was. But he was making progress; he could really\nbegin to learn things.\n\n\"You do not need to keep the harness on Ebony all the time,\" he\nexplained aloud. \"Just when you want to go out with him. In your home\nor office, leave it off, as it is probably not too comfortable. I'm\nsure,\" he decided to do a bit of direct suggesting, \"that you'll soon\ngrow to love the cat enough so you'll want to keep it with you all the\ntime. It will lie on your desk, or in your lap, and be the finest sort\nof companion.\"\n\n\"Yes, and be the envy of all my friends,\" Yandor swelled with\nimportance.\n\nHanlon explained rapidly about its feeding and drinking habits, and\nthat while it was house-broken it should be taken outdoors several\ntimes a day. When he was sure Yandor knew how to care for the animal,\nHanlon left the office and went back to his rooms.\n\nAfter the performance that night, Hanlon went quickly home and lay\ndown on the bed. He sent out a portion of his mind to contact that of\nEbony, which Yandor had taken to his own room and installed in a padded\nbasket, as Hanlon had suggested.\n\nThrough the cat's eyes he could see the interior of Yandor's bedroom,\nand watched while the latter prepared for bed and finally dropped off\nto sleep. Then Hanlon withdrew his mind, and did the same.\n\nHe had set the wake-up on his time-teller for fairly early the next\nmorning. Immediately upon awakening he sent part of his mind back into\nthat of the cat. All during the day--which he spent mainly lying down\nor sprawled in his easy chair, when he was not preparing or eating his\nmeals, or attending to the wants of his roches--he watched Yandor at\nhis daily activities.\n\nFor the impresario, delighted with his new pet, kept the cat with him\nall the time, even to taking it into the office-like study of his home\nwith him. There, as soon as they were inside, Hanlon made Ebony leap\nup onto the table-desk, and curl up on the one corner. He wanted this\nhabit to become a permanent one--and it, too, delighted the Estrellan.\n\nNow the cat was in the best possible place for Hanlon's spying while\nYandor was at home.\n\nLater in the day, when it was time for the entrepreneur to go to his\ndowntown office, he put into effect another suggestion Hanlon had made.\nHe put the small, ornate harness Hanlon had given him for that purpose\nonto the cat, snapped the leash to it, and took Ebony with him.\n\nDozens of Yandor's friends stopped him and complimented him--though\nsomewhat jealously--upon his acquisition, which made him prouder than\never. For Ebony created such a sensation that it took Yandor nearly an\nhour longer than usual to get to his office.\n\nHe had not yet reached there, in fact, when Hanlon was surprised and\na little nettled by a knock on his apartment door. Somewhat angrily\nhe got up off the bed, and went and opened it. A native was standing\nthere, grinning.\n\n\"What d'you want?\" Hanlon growled querulously.\n\n\"Boy, are you in a temper this morning?\" a voice said in Terran, while\nthe grin grew lop-sided.\n\n\"Morrie!\" Hanlon yelled, throwing his arms about the other. Then, over\nhis shoulder, he noticed a number of his neighbors peering out of\ntheir doors, or standing about in the hall, listening, and knew with\na sinking feeling that they must have heard the Terran words, and be\nwondering about them. His mind raced, then he spoke even more loudly in\nEstrellan.\n\n\"My brother, it is such a surprise to see you here. How did you happen\nto come from Lura to visit me?\" Then he dragged the surprised S S man\ninto his room, and shut the door.\n\n\"What gives? Why that 'my brother' routine?\"\n\n\"Noticed the neighbors gawking, and knew they had heard us talking\nTerran. But I sure am glad to see you, even if I was so curt at first.\nWas concentrating on a job, and didn't like being interrupted just\nthen.\"\n\n\"Oh, sorry. Want me to come back later?\"\n\n\"No, no, it wasn't really that important.\" Hanlon was silent a short\nmoment while he disengaged the part of his mind that was in Ebony, and\nbrought it back into his own. \"Come on, take that chair. Go ahead and\ngab while I get dressed.\"\n\nManning did as requested, and they talked seriously for some time, each\nbringing the other up to date on all they knew about their part of this\nbusiness, and what they were planning.\n\nIn particular, Hanlon told Manning about the local aspects of the work\nof the criminal elements, and what he suspected as well as what he\nactually knew and had done.\n\n\"I'm almost certain now,\" he said, \"that the criminals and the folks\nwho're trying to keep Estrella out of the Federation are tied in\ntogether, but I haven't any real proof ... yet. But I think I soon will\nhave, with the line of investigation I'm on.\"\n\n\"We've about come to the same conclusion,\" Manning said thoughtfully,\n\"but we haven't any more proof than you have, if as much.\"\n\nHanlon told him about stopping Auldin's \"wrecking crew\", and a few\nother possible leads he had uncovered to local men who seemed to be in\non the activities here, especially one Ovil Esbor, a local politician.\n\n\"He's a sort of gang-boss or district captain,\" Hanlon added, \"but I\nthink he has quite a lot of fingers in different illegal pies.\"\n\n\"I'll get right at it,\" Manning said. \"The admiral--he sent his\nregards, by the way--said we were to work together as closely as\npossible, and that you would feed me leads whenever you got 'em--as I\nwill you.\"\n\n\"Sure, I will. Maybe I'm sticking my neck out, trying for the big\nfellows and asking you to take care of the smaller fry, but it\nseems....\"\n\n\"Think nothing of it, little chum,\" Manning waved his hand airily. \"As\nlong as we clean out his hoo-raw's nest, I don't care how we do it,\nand I'm ready to work at anything. The admiral said--and what you've\ntold me clinches it--that I'd better be an aspirant for a spot in the\npolitical set-up here, so I'll pretend I heard about Esbor, and go\nright to him.\"\n\nFor another hour they discussed ways and means, and then Manning rose\nto go, after telling Hanlon where he was living here in Stearra.\n\n\"We'll see each other every few days,\" he said.\n\nAs soon as Manning was gone, Hanlon threw himself on the bed and again\nsent part of his mind back into that of the cat, now with Yandor in the\nlatter's office. And Hanlon kept it in Ebony's brain all the rest of\nthat day and early evening. But nothing in which he was particularly\ninterested happened--and he was beginning to wonder if his ideas about\nYandor were right after all. Nothing but legitimate theatrical business\nhad been transacted all day--at least while Hanlon was watching. There\nhad been those two hours or more while Manning was at his rooms....\n\nDuring the time Hanlon was on the stage that night, he had to\nconcentrate all his mental faculties on his roches, and had to withdraw\nfrom the cat's brain. But once back in his dressing room and while\ngoing home and after he got there, Hanlon watched carefully the party\nthe impresario gave to a group of friends in his palatial home.\n\nThrough the cat's eyes Hanlon carefully studied each one of the guests\nand listened avidly to their talk--and at times had to tighten his\ncontrol of Ebony's mind and muscles to keep it acting friendly toward\nsome of those people. They seemed to \"rub its fur the wrong way\" ...\nand did, literally, on occasions. Also, they had an effluvia Ebony\ndistinctly did not like.\n\nBut under Hanlon's compulsion, it continued to act in as friendly a\nmanner as cats usually do ... most of the time with customary feline\nindifference.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9\n\n\nThe next day Hanlon also spent in the cat's mind, when he was not\nplaying with or attending to his roches, or eating. It happened that he\nhad transferred part of his mind to each of the eight, and was giving\nthem a short workout, when there was a sudden noise at his door, and it\nwas roughly flung open--he had not locked it while at home.\n\nNine parts of his mind saw through nine pairs of eyes the man who\nstormed in. Nine pairs of ears heard him snarl, \"What's the big idea of\nhaving my men arrested?\"\n\nAs quickly as he could Hanlon started bringing the portions of his mind\nfrom the roches into his own brain. He sat up on the bed, and made his\nface look blank--but inside he was thunderstruck. How had Ran Auldin\nfound out he was behind those arrests?\n\n\"Why ... why,\" he pretended to stammer. \"I don't know what you're\ntalking about, Ran. What arrests? What's happened?\"\n\nThe usually fastidious gang-boss was now dirty and his clothing soiled\nand rumpled. His eyes were red, apparently from sleeplessness, or\nworry, or both. His voice was still accusing as he answered, \"My men\nwere surprised at their work the other night, and I only escaped by\nluck. Been hiding ever since.\"\n\n\"But what's it all about? Why were they arrested? I don't know\nanything about what you were doing--Yandor didn't tell....\"\n\n\"It must have been you. Nobody else knew.\"\n\n\"And I tell you I was not told, either, so how could I know? I've been\ntoo busy getting my act ready and putting it on, and Yandor hasn't even\nmentioned you to me.\"\n\nAuldin stepped close to the side of the bed as Hanlon struggled to get\nup, and pushed him down again. Now Hanlon could see that the mobster\nwas carrying in each hand a piece of large rope, approximately half an\ninch in diameter and about two feet long. The far end of each was tied\ninto a knot, in which pieces of wires had been woven to add weight.\n\n\"Maybe you didn't have anything to do with the arrests,\" Auldin\nadmitted, \"but I still think you did. Anyway, you used me to get in\ngood with Yandor, then turned him against me. I don't like that.\"\n\nOh, so that was what had really touched him off. Hanlon saw that the\nslim man was spoiling for a fight--and that he was using almost any\nexcuse to try to take it out of a fellow who was making good where he\nhad failed.\n\nHanlon thought, \"I don't want to hurt the guy, now that he's down, but\nI sure don't want to get hurt, either.\" He had never seen exactly such\nweapons as Auldin was carrying, but he had a good idea the native was\nadept in their handling. They looked old and well-used.\n\nHanlon rolled suddenly across the bed and jumped to his feet on the\nother side. But Auldin ran swiftly around the foot of the bed, and\nHanlon was more or less cornered in a narrow space. First one of those\nstrange weapons flicked out, then the other, and Hanlon quickly found\nout how effective they were. The way Auldin snapped and whipped them,\nmade them almost impossible to dodge, and Hanlon felt their burnings\nacross his shoulders--although he was able to protect his face from\nthose first quick flicks.\n\nHanlon had to get out of that corner, so the next time both ropes\nflashed out toward him he ducked beneath, down and forward, under\nAuldin's arms--and was in the center of the room.\n\nThe S S man reached out and took over the minds of two of his roches,\nand made them run between Auldin's legs. Then, as the ropes with\nthose terrible knots at the ends flashed out, Hanlon grabbed them and\nyanked. The combination of that pull and the roches entangled between\nhis legs was enough to upset the gangster, and he stumbled forward.\nHanlon quickly swarmed onto him and got a judo hold on Auldin the man\ncould not break. Holding him thus, Hanlon took the two ropes from his\npowerless hands, and threw them into a far corner.\n\n\"Now get this, and get it straight,\" Hanlon panted, but as impressively\nas he could. \"I still don't know what this is all about, but I don't\nlike your barging into my room and attacking me like this. Now get out\nand stay away from me. You try anything like this again, and so help\nme I'll kill you. And just so you'll remember....\" Hanlon put all his\npent-up wrath into his fist and threw it at the now-deflated Auldin's\njaw. This, he knew, was the only way really to impress a man of that\ntype.\n\nHe then forced the half-groggy gangster out of the room and loosed him\nin the hallway, then shut and locked his door. He listened intently,\nand finally heard the fellow's mumblings and footsteps going down the\nstairs. From the window Hanlon watched the thoroughly-frightened native\nscuttle off down the street, looking furtively all about to see that he\nwas not being followed or observed. Hanlon felt satisfied that he would\nhave no further trouble from him.\n\nAs he went back to bed, Hanlon tried to figure this one out. Evidently\nAuldin did not really know Hanlon had caused those arrests, but was\nmerely using that as an excuse to provoke a fight with one whom he\nhated for making a success at the same time he, Auldin, was a failure\nin hiding.\n\nHad Auldin reported this to Yandor? Hanlon had not seen the two\ntogether--either through his own or Ebony's eyes--nor had he found\nanything of the sort in Yandor's mind. But he would have to try to find\nout that answer, also, among the many others.\n\nHe sent his mind back into that of the cat, and took up his spying of\nthe theatrical agent.\n\nAbout an hour later Yandor had a caller, and Hanlon \"listened in\" with\ninterest and growing delight. For it was Ovil Esbor, the politician.\nFrom the talk between the two, in Yandor's inner, closed office--into\nwhich Ebony had also gone--Hanlon got further confirmation of his\nsuspicions. He was more sure than ever now that Yandor was the \"top\nboss\" here in Stearra, at least, while Esbor was boss of many other\nlocal gangs, including thieves, dope peddlers and panderers.\n\nHanlon, in his room, made copious notes. \"There,\" he exclaimed after\nthe two men had parted. \"That ought to give Morrie enough info to hang\n'em. I'll take these notes to him right away.\"\n\nBut Manning was not in his room when Hanlon got there, and since his\ndoor was padlocked, Hanlon could not get in. He took a chance and slid\nhis notes under the door.\n\nAll this time, however, Hanlon had been watching Yandor through Ebony's\nmind. He had just barely got back to his apartment when the impresario\nhad another visitor ... a masked man. (Hanlon doubted the man had gone\nthrough the streets masked--probably had put it on just before entering\nYandor's office.)\n\n\"Ha! This should be good,\" and the young S S man paid even closer\nattention, even as he was putting his motor-trike away, and running up\nto his room. He heard the two distant men discussing many matters of\npolicy, closeted in that inner room of Yandor's. Hanlon found that the\ncriminal activities were, as he and the other secret servicemen had\ndeduced, planet-wide and under one general control. He knew positively,\nwhen this conversation ended, that Yandor was in charge of the\nactivities of this half of the world--the largest continent--and that\nthe masked man was above him in authority.\n\nWas this other king-pin of the whole thing? Or was he, perhaps, what\nmight be termed the \"executive director\" of the planetary criminal\nring? Whatever he was, he was the man Hanlon must get next to and\nunmask. The Corpsman thrilled. He was gradually but surely climbing\nthat ladder, tediously and maddeningly slow though it seemed sometimes.\n\n\"One thing looks sure,\" Hanlon thought to himself. \"Whether or not this\nbunch is the one that is opposing Estrella's joining the Federation, if\nwe can eliminate them it will mean curbing, if not entirely stopping,\nthis planet-wide crime wave. That'll be worthwhile, even if it's not\nreally our job.\"\n\nHe tried to figure some way to get rid of these two men. If he could\nlop off the head, the body would die--unless it was a Hydra, with\nself-regenerating heads.\n\nBut after an hour or so of further study and thought, it was borne in\nupon his consciousness that this was not his job at all. He must quit\ntrying to be the big cheese. If he got any leads, the information must\nbe turned over to his father and the secret service general staff, and\nlet them--not him--worry about how to get rid of these men, or punish\nthem in whatever way Estrellan law provided.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Hanlon went to the theatre that night, he found Yandor there, with\nEbony on its leash--as he had known he would from watching the man\nthrough the cat's senses. There was another man with the agent, whom\nHanlon had been studying, puzzled by the curious ... blocking? ... in\nthe man's mind. Yandor now introduced him as \"my good friend, Egon,\"\nand the three chatted together until it was time for Hanlon to go and\nprepare. Egon complimented him highly on his act, which he said he had\nseen twice already, and upon the perfect training of his animals.\n\n\"How in the name of Zappa do you do it?\" he asked. \"It's hard enough\neven to tame roches, to say nothing of training them as you've done.\"\n\nHanlon grinned. \"Professional secret, nyer.\" Then he sobered and added,\n\"Actually, it's mainly a matter of hours and days and months of hard\nwork with them, until they know me and like me well enough to do what I\ntell them, and I know what they are able to do.\"\n\nHe broke away, then, before they could question him further. In his\ndressing room, while he was putting the uniforms on his dogs and\nhimself, and donning his roch-mask, he pondered seriously a thing\nthat had struck him a stunning blow. For Ebony's mind and delicate\nsenses seemed to detect a distinct similarity between the tones of\nEgon's voice and those of the masked man--as well as a sameness of\neffluvia--even though the two spoke in different keys and timbre of\nvoice.\n\nProfoundly stirred, Hanlon studied this seeming fact with intense\nconcentration. How could he make certain?\n\nBut his call came just then, and he had to let this new matter rest\nwhile he devoted his entire mind to the work of controlling his roches\nfor their act.\n\nLater, in his room, as he again watched Yandor through the cat's eyes,\nhe saw him in his home with Egon and two other men, playing cards, but\nmerely as a group of friends. Nothing whatever was said, during the\nhours, about any special activities of a criminal nature. No sedition\nnor revolution was talked; neither Terra nor the matter of Estrella's\njoining the Federation was so much as mentioned.\n\nStill Hanlon was not sure--and he must become so. Perhaps, he reasoned,\nthe other two men were not in on any of these activities, and for\nthat reason Yandor and Egon could not discuss these matters in their\npresence. Or perhaps Egon, himself, was not part of Yandor's criminal\ngroup after all.\n\nThere must be some way of getting proof, Hanlon thought anxiously. How\ncould he positively connect the two, and make sure whether or not the\ncat's feelings were correct--that Egon was the masked man?\n\nThe opportunity came just before the party broke up for the night, many\nhours later. Egon had picked up the cat and was petting it, as the men\nwere preparing to leave Yandor's house. Not being used to cats, and not\nknowing the manner in which they like to be petted--rubbing the fur the\nway it naturally lies down--Egon was ruffling it and rubbing his hands\nforth and back across Ebony's body.\n\nThe cat did not like it. It was only Hanlon's firm control that kept it\nfrom ... \"Hey, that's it!\"\n\nHe released control of the cat's actions, while still watching through\nits eyes and ears. Egon's hand again rubbed heavily upward across the\ncat's fur. Almost light-swift was the slash of a clawed paw ... and\nEgon yelped as he dropped Ebony to clap his hand to his chin, on which\nblood began seeping from several deep and painful scratches.\n\nEgon aimed a hard kick in its direction, but Ebony dodged safely away\nand ran under a large piece of furniture.\n\n\"What happened?\" Yandor sprang forward, a cloth in his hand to wipe\naway the blood from Egon's chin. \"Wait a minute. I'll get medicine to\nput on that.\"\n\n\"Get rid of that cursed animal or I'll kill it,\" Egon blazed.\n\n\"Well now, you must have hurt it some way,\" Yandor said placatingly\nas he daubed medicine on his friend's chin, stopping the bleeding and\nrelieving the pain. \"Ebony is so friendly and quiet, I can't understand\nit. He never acted that way before.\"\n\n\"Well, keep the vicious thing caged after this, then,\" and Egon stomped\nout of the house, the other two men silently following.\n\nNor could Hanlon detect anything in Yandor's mind, which he invaded as\nquickly as possible, that this was anything more than the grumbling of\na friend who had been accidentally injured. Yet there was a bit of fear\nof that other man there, and a resolution to keep the cat out of sight\nwhen Egon was around.\n\nDid Yandor, himself, know that Egon and the masked man were the\nsame--or were Hanlon and Ebony wrong? If not, why was Yandor afraid?\nThere were many questions, but no answers--and Hanlon fumed.\n\nHe must get facts. He was getting a lot of suspicions and possible\nclues, and certainly more information all the time. But none of them\ntied in together as yet; none of them were provable facts.\n\nSlowly, as he thought this out, it became more and more apparent to\nHanlon that he must no longer be tied down to his work at the theatre.\nIt--and taking care of the roches daytimes--was demanding entirely too\nmuch of his time. Besides, it had only been undertaken to give him a\nchance to get acquainted with Ino Yandor and, later, to give Hanlon a\nreason for presenting the cat to this pet-collector.\n\nSo, when he went to the theatre that night, Hanlon was, to all intents\nand purposes, roaring drunk. He was surly and insolent to everyone\nhe met, and his performance was terrible. The roches did not stay in\nstraight lines, they were out of step often, and fumbled and stumbled\nin one way or another much of the time. The master of ceremonies\nfinally came out, forced Hanlon off the stage, then apologized to the\nstunned audience.\n\n\"What made you think you could get away with anything like this?\" the\nmanager demanded hotly, down in Hanlon's dressing room. \"You're through\nhere--the act is cancelled. And I'll make sure no other theatre hires\nyou.\"\n\n\"Well now, that's right,\" another angry voice broke in, and Hanlon\nturned to see Yandor, his face black. \"Your entire contract is broken\nas of now. I'll not tolerate such a disgraceful performance from anyone\nunder me.\"\n\nHanlon blustered and cursed, and yanked off his costume to get\ninto his street clothes. He apparently was not concerned with the\nroches--did not even take off their costumes--but actually he was\nseeing to it that none of this anger touched their minds or affected\nthem in any way.\n\nBack in his room he considered the matter for some time, and decided he\nhad put it across all right--that these touchy men would not connect\nhim with any reverses they might suffer later in their outside criminal\nwork.\n\nHe considered the problem of his roches. He had always loved dogs, and\nhaving become so intimate with these Estrellan pooches, he hated to\npart with them. They were such lovable pets, so gentle and affectionate\nand loyal. Knowing their minds so intimately, Hanlon knew they had\noften wondered at the way they were being handled and made to do things\nbeyond their ordinary ability--yet not one of them had ever had the\nleast rebellious thought of ill-feeling toward this master who made\nthem do such unusual things.\n\nBut Hanlon knew he could no longer take care of them as they deserved,\nthat they would only be in his way from now on. His first act the next\nmorning after they had been fed, was to see to it that they were taken\nout and good homes found for them. There were many children living in\nhis own and neighboring houses, who were glad to receive gifts of such\nfine pets.\n\nThat worry solved, Hanlon went back to his room and spent most of the\nday there, a great deal of it lying down on his bed or sprawled out in\nhis easy chair, his mind in that of Ebony, the cat, or roaming the city\nwatching the minds of the people he knew and suspected.\n\nDuring the afternoon the masked man called on Yandor again. Through\nEbony's sharp eyes Hanlon carefully scrutinized and studied the lower\npart of the visitor's face, which luckily the mask did not cover.\n\n\"Hah!\" he exclaimed gleefully. For those scratches were quite\nplainly visible to one who knew exactly where they were, and who was\nspecifically looking for them, even though it was apparent there had\nbeen a careful attempt to conceal them with cosmetics.\n\nEgon and the masked man, then, were one and the same!\n\nBut who was he, really? That was Hanlon's next important problem.\n\nThe following night, through the cat's eyes, Hanlon again saw Egon and\nthe other two men coming into Yandor's house for one of their usual\ncard games. Now, perhaps, was his chance to find out who the man was,\nand where he lived.\n\nEbony had been banished to the next room, but through its ears Hanlon\nwas listening carefully, to know that the four were still in the house.\nMeanwhile, he dressed and rode his motor-tricycle to the vicinity\nof Yandor's home. There he hid himself in a dense shadow, always in\npossession of Ebony's mind, waiting for signs that the men were getting\nready to leave.\n\nUnexpectedly, however, as they were going out, a large, ornate,\nmotorized-tricycle with double seats drove up to the house. Egon\nentered it and was driven rapidly away, far faster than Hanlon's\nsmaller machine could possibly go.\n\nThe young S S man was caught flat-footed. Or wait, was he? There was a\nway, after all ... for him.\n\nSwiftly his mind sought about and quickly found a sleeping bird in a\nnearby tree. Taking control of its mind, he sent it winging after the\nspeeding car, and by this method was able to follow it as it drove\nswiftly out into the country.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_In the spaceship above, a decision was made. By means of the\nmultiphased scanner, certain entities on the planet below, whose\ngeneral position was already known, were hunted out. For the alien now\ndefinitely concluded that they were highly inimical to its plans._\n\n_By certain means those beings were captured and taken forcibly to a\nplace that had been prepared._\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\n\nImmediately after SSM George Hanlon had sent part of his mind into that\nof a bird and had made it follow Egon's car, the young man followed on\nhis own trike, driven at its top speed out along the road the faster\nmachine had taken.\n\nHe cussed the slowness of this clumsy vehicle, wishing he had a fast\nTerran jet-cycle or car. But he had to make do with what he had, and\nfinally calmed himself with the knowledge that he could see where the\nother went, through the bird's eyes, even if he himself could not close\nup the distance separating them.\n\n\"You oughtta be ashamed of yourself,\" he scolded himself. \"Who else\ncould turn this into success? Be thankful for your great luck in having\nsuch a wonderful talent--and quit this eternal griping the minute\nsomething goes the tiniest bit haywire.\"\n\nThus he saw when the other car turned in through the gates leading to\nthe drive before a rather small, but excellent cottage. The tricycle\nstopped at the doorway, and Egon got out and entered the house. The\nchauffeur drove into a shed behind the house, left the machine and\nthen, himself, went into the main house through a back door.\n\nMaking the bird peer in through the windows, Hanlon was able to see\nthat this house, while small, was richly and comfortably furnished\naccording to Estrellan standards. By the time he arrived in the\nvicinity in person, ready to take over the inspection himself, Hanlon\nhad a fairly good idea of the ground-floor layout. The upper story was\nstill in darkness, none of the rooms yet lighted.\n\nHanlon's first act was to direct the bird to a comfortable perch in a\nnearby tree, close to a semi-rotted spot where there were dozens of\ngrubs for its breakfast, and let it go back to sleep. He was always so\nthankful to his various animal and bird assistants that he was careful\nto be thoughtful of their ease and well-being.\n\nNow, after parking his machine in the shadows of a large flowertree,\nHanlon dodged from shadow to shadow, scouting the house and\nneighborhood carefully.\n\nAs best he could judge the estate must be about three acres in extent.\nThere were quite an unusual number of flower beds, and a few quite\nlarge flowertrees that should give him considerable cover if he wanted\nto get closer--which he did not care to risk at this time.\n\n\"Mmmm, must be about seven rooms,\" he mused as he examined the little\nhouse. As was usual with Estrellan buildings, it was pentagonal in\nshape, and with a green-tile roof. Behind it, in addition to the shed\nwhere the tricycle was kept, there was another small stone building.\nBut it was dark, and Hanlon could not tell what it was used for.\n\nAfter seeing all he could from a distance of the outside of Egon's\nplace, Hanlon looked about the neighborhood. It was not too closely\nbuilt up, but some distance down the street he saw what appeared to be\na shopping district. One building was lighted up even at this hour,\nand he shrewdly guessed it might be a place where men drank. So it\nproved, and Hanlon entered. While sipping a glass of mykkyl, he did\nsome discreet investigating, both by talking to the serving girl, and\nby searching the minds of the customers in the cafe.\n\nHe was almost rocked back on his heels when he found that the house he\nhad scouted was the home of Adwal Irad--the Second In Line.\n\n\"Ow!\" he yelped mentally. \"So Egon and Irad are the same? Where does\nthat put me?\"\n\nHe again investigated the minds of the few men and women there in\nthe drinking place, looking for thoughts about Irad. Then he left,\nand slowly rode home, thinking seriously. This was really startling\nnews--and yet, it was half-expected at that. So many clues had pointed\nthat way. So this really meant that Irad was in back of all the\npernicious activities that were going on.\n\nBut in the name of Snyder, _why_?\n\nThat question had him stopped ... for the present. Oh, he could think\nof a dozen reasons, yes. But there was no way--at the moment--of\nknowing which if any of them was correct. Also, it didn't square with\nIrad's position, nor with what he had so far learned about the man--not\neven what his neighbors thought of him, as Hanlon had learned there in\nthe cafe. It was distinctly not in character, and was certainly not\nwhat one would expect of the heir to the planetary Rulership.\n\nThe next day Hanlon devoted to wandering about the city, hunting for\ninformation and thoughts about Adwal Irad. Many times he got into\nconversation with people of high and low degree, asking questions that\nforced them to think about the Second In Line, so he could read the\nreal thoughts about the man in the minds of these selected people.\n\nTwice he rode his trike to the house where Manning lived, to tell what\nhe had learned and to discuss it with him, but neither time was his\nfellow-operative at home.\n\nNow, the more Hanlon investigated--the more people he talked to and the\nmore minds he studied--the more puzzled he became. Irad just wasn't\nthat kind of a man--at least, he had never been associated in the minds\nof his future subjects with that sort of thing. He was really well\nliked. In fact, the general attitude was almost that of hero-worship.\nAnd Hanlon knew that where there is hero-worship there first has to be\nsomeone worthy of being thought a hero.\n\nSomething was screwy somewhere. With what Hanlon was beginning to learn\nabout Irad....\n\nBrash and self-confident as he was, Hanlon knew this was something that\nmust be brought to the attention of his father and the other S S men\nhere. How could he most quickly contact the admiral?\n\n\"Manning probably knows exactly how to get in touch with dad,\" he\nthought. \"He talked with him only a few days ago.\"\n\nBut again Manning was not at home, and Hanlon could not banish the\nthoughts of worry and frustration from his mind as he rode slowly back\nto his own rooms. He again set the wake-up on his time-teller for an\nearly hour, and went to sleep. When the call came he hurriedly rose,\ndressed and breakfasted. Then he went out of his room and the house.\n\nJust as he reached the street and turned toward the part of the city\nwhere Manning lived, he swivelled about sharply as he heard the _splat,\nsplat_ of running feet coming up behind him. Running--staggering,\nrather--down the narrow, rutty road was a native, his great feet\nraising clouds of dust.\n\nSomething in the fellow's wild manner held Hanlon's attention. As the\nrunner drew nearer, his wildly waving arms, his blood-shot, almost\nunseeing eyes, told all too plainly that he was badly frightened. Yet,\nso far as Hanlon could see, nothing or no one was pursuing him.\n\nAs the native drew closer, Hanlon gave a start. Why, he knew ... but\nit couldn't be--he was on the Eastern Continent, thousands of miles\naway. Hanlon's mind must be playing tricks on him. But he scanned the\nfellow more closely, touching his mind, and at last was sure. It was!\nDisguised as a native humanoid though he was, Hanlon knew this was Curt\nHooper, another of the secret servicemen who was working on this planet.\n\nHanlon stepped into the road to intercept the runner. He spoke as the\nman came abreast him, but Hooper paid no attention--seemed not even to\nsee him.\n\nMore puzzled than ever, the young S S man ran alongside and reached out\nto grasp the runner's arm, forcing him to a halt. \"Hey, Curt, it's me,\nHanlon,\" he said. \"What's the matter?\" He was now deeply concerned.\n\n\"Don't stop me; gotta run; gotta get away,\" came gasping Terran words,\neven as the other tried to loosen himself from Hanlon's grasp.\n\nHanlon probed quickly into the man's mind but, as usual, he could\nread only the surface thoughts. These told of some terrible danger\nthreatening--that only running, always running away, could possibly\nsave him.\n\nWhat the danger was; who or what was threatening him, was not in those\nsurface thoughts.\n\n\"Snyder help me,\" Hanlon begged bitterly beneath his breath. Why\ncouldn't he learn how to penetrate deeper into human minds, as he could\nwith animals, and read everything that was there, instead of merely\nwhatever thoughts were passing across the surface?\n\nBut Hooper was fighting as only a madman can fight, and Hanlon was\nbarely able to hold him. Yet he must. He _had_ to learn what this\nwas all about--why Hooper was here in the Town of the Ruler, instead\nof back where he had been stationed. What the danger was, and if it\nthreatened the work of the secret servicemen, and possibly the other\nTerrans. It was clear that Hooper was either drugged or that his mind\nhad become _un_sane in some manner--whether permanently or temporarily,\nHanlon could not as yet figure out.\n\nActing on sudden impulse, Hanlon switched his grasp to a neo-judo hold\nhe had been taught, that made Hooper powerless in his hands. He dragged\nhis companion back inside.\n\nOnce in his room Hanlon forced Hooper's unwilling body down on the bed,\nand pressed certain nerve-ends that temporarily paralyzed his body. In\nthis way Hanlon could be more free to study that sick mind, which was\nnot paralyzed, without having to watch every minute lest the deranged\nman escape him.\n\nWhile Hanlon was able only to read the surface thoughts, he had learned\nfrom experience that by asking leading questions he could often make\nthe other think of things he wanted to know, and this method he now put\ninto practice.\n\nWhat he learned now, in spite of all the leading questions he could\nthink of to ask, was pitifully meager. Hooper had been made a prisoner\nand brought to this continent and confined, but had escaped. But he did\nnot know--or could not be made to reveal--why he was on this Western\nContinent at all, nor how he had been captured or by whom. Hanlon\nguessed that the man had been held in a small house somewhere fairly\nnear, since he had been running away from there a fairly short time,\neven though it had seemed an eternity to the frightened man.\n\nSuddenly a stray wisp of thought brought Hanlon upright in his chair.\n\n\"Give me that again, Curt!\" he demanded, and under his questioning\nbrought out the fact that his father, Admiral Newton, was also a\nprisoner of these unknowns, as was the fourth member of the S S who had\nbeen assigned to Estrella--Morris Manning.\n\n\"Mannie couldn't stand the pain, he died,\" Hooper's thought was\nstrangely calm and apparently heartless--which Hanlon knew could not be\nthe man's true feelings, for Hooper and Manning had been close friends\nof long standing.\n\n\"What kind of pain? Who was hurting him?\" Hanlon demanded, sick with\ndread. \"Were all of you being tortured? Was dad?\" Oh, God, _why_\ncouldn't he get in there and read the true answers?\n\nAs best he could figure it out, they had never seen their captor, but\nhad felt his mind probing theirs, asking questions, _interrogating_\nthem--in the Estrellan language. Whoever was doing it apparently\ndid not intend it to be torture, for when Manning died the other two\nreceived a curiously surprised yet apologetic thought, \"Your nerve\nsensitivity is greater than ours. It was not intended to force this\nentity's life-force out of physical embodiment. Greater care shall be\nused in the future.\"\n\n\"Tell me more about dad,\" Hanlon commanded, agonizedly. \"Where is he\nheld? Who has him? What's it all about?\"\n\nBut the dazed Hooper relapsed back to the only words he seemed able to\nsay aloud, \"Gotta run; gotta get away.\"\n\n\"But you're safe here, Curt. No one's following you, and I won't let\nanyone or anything hurt you. Relax.\"\n\n\"Gotta run; gotta get away.\" And so powerful was the urge that the\nsupine body twitched restlessly, as it began breaking out of that\nparalysis Hanlon had imposed on it.\n\nFrantically, Hanlon continued his mind-scanning, asking innumerable\nquestions that he hoped would penetrate the other's consciousness and\nforce his mind to think along the lines Hanlon wanted to know.\n\nAnd slowly, sketchily, he began to piece together a picture of\nsorts--like a jigsaw puzzle of which many of the pieces were missing.\n\nThe three S S men had been brought together in some little stone\nbuilding. There the unknown, whom they never saw nor heard, had\ninterrogated them mentally, a process that was extremely painful in\na way that Hooper could not, or did not, specify, save that his mind\nseemed to wince and recoil from any thought of the method, despite\nHanlon's utmost attempts to learn it.\n\nThere seemed to have been days and nights of this painful questioning,\nalthough Hooper could not tell exactly how long--and Hanlon knew it\ncould not have been very many days, since he had seen Manning so\nrecently.\n\nThen, early this morning, shortly after Manning's death, and while\nHooper was being questioned, it seemed to him the mental voice had\ngone away abruptly, leaving him in full command of his senses. He had\nimmediately begun to examine the room, and soon found that the low door\nwas unfastened. Cautiously he opened it, and discovered that it opened\nto the outside of the building. The admiral had not been in the room\nwith him at the time, nor could Hooper find a way into the other parts\nof the building--if there were any other parts to it.\n\nTherefore, he had lost no time in leaving by that providentially open\ndoor. He started running across a lawn toward the nearest road. Down\nthis he ran, knowing only a terrified compulsion to run, to hide, to\nget away from that horrible inquisition.\n\n\"How long have you been running?\" Hanlon asked sympathetically, yet in\nhopes it might give him a clue.\n\n\"Gotta run; gotta get away,\" Hooper's words said, but the thought\nflashed across his mind, \"since after dawn.\"\n\n\"Then dad's not too far away,\" Hanlon thought, and began trying to\nguess where or in what direction the prison might be, and how he could\nlocate it most quickly.\n\nHe was awakened to reality to see Hooper rise from the bed, the\nparalysis broken by that inner compulsion to flee. Before Hanlon could\njump up to stop him, Hooper was out of the room.\n\nHanlon let him go. He hated to do it, but there was no apparent way he\ncould save Hooper now ... and he _had_ to get to his father just as\nfast as he could. Not only because the admiral was his adored dad, but\nbecause he was second in command of the whole I-S C's secret service,\nand in charge of this mission, and thus the more important at the\nmoment.\n\n\"But where is he?\" Hanlon's thoughts were an agonized wail. For the\nfirst time in months he felt very young, and inexperienced, and unsure.\n\nHe jumped to his feet to leave the house and start searching, but\nrestrained himself before he got to the door. \"Whoa, boy, not so\nfast. I haven't got the faintest idea where dad is. Must think this\nout first, and not waste a lot of time during which he might die or be\nkilled.\"\n\nHe sank back into his chair again, and his mind swiftly reviewed the\npitifully small bits of information he had been able to glean from the\nderanged mind of his friend Hooper.\n\nSomeone, or something, or some group, who were the main support of this\nopposition, had a mental ability Hanlon thought he knew the Estrellans\ndid not have. At least, he had not found any traces of it anywhere\nhere. Or, wait now. Did the Rulers have it? Was this one of the traits\nand abilities especially bred into them in the course of making them\ncapable of handling their tremendous task of being Planetary Ruler?\nCould be. He had not yet had the chance to scan mentally Elus Amir,\nthe present Ruler, except for that one night at the theatre, and then\nhe had not really tried to see what the man had in the way of mental\nequipment. Hanlon had been so relieved to find he and the audience were\napplauding, instead of booing, that he had not tried to do so.\n\nIf Elus Amir as Ruler had it, did Adwal Irad as Second-In-Line also\nhave those mental powers?\n\nWhoever or whatever it was--and that would have to be studied more\nthoroughly later--some mind or minds had forced the other three secret\nservicemen to go to a certain place ... at present unknown to\nHanlon ... and had there imprisoned them and tried to extract\ninformation from their minds.\n\nInformation about what ... and why? What could these unknowns want\nto know that couldn't be learned by asking direct questions? For the\nFederation statesmen and Survey men had been glad and anxious to answer\nfully and truthfully every question that had been asked of them.\n\nAnd that puzzling thought Hooper had said they received when Manning\ndied. \"Your nerve sensitivity is greater than ours--we had not realized\nit would kill you to be thus interrogated.\" Or words to that effect.\nAs far as Hanlon knew, the native Estrellans did not have unusual\nresistance to pain. He had had several encounters with them so far, and\nhad known cases where they were hurt or wounded, and had not noticed\nany great immunity to pain. Was this, then, another special attribute\nof the Rulers? But Egon, or Irad, had certainly felt pain when Ebony\nscratched his chin, and had made quite a fuss about it. Was it real--or\nwas he \"putting on an act\" to conceal his immunity? Somehow, Hanlon was\nnot willing to accept that last.\n\nDimly, in the back of his mind, there seemed to be another puzzling\nthought. What was it? Hanlon worried at it like one of the roches might\nworry a bone ... and finally it struck him--hard.\n\nIf the other three had been captured, why hadn't he?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_At its multiphased scanner in the spaceship high above, the being\nstiffened suddenly. For long minutes the mind concentrated on this new\nproblem. The plan put into operation that morning had been partially\nsuccessful. The \"location\" of that unreadable mind before noticed,\nfound once and then lost--was now known again._\n\n_But still, despite every effort, contact with that mind could not be\nmade._\n\n_After a time, therefore, with the utmost precision a thought was\ninsinuated into the Estrellan mind constantly being held captive.\nThe thought was seen to take hold, then its strength and urgency was\nincreased._\n\n_Soon, although the native was at a loss to account for the reason\nwhy such a thought should come to him at that particular time, he\nnevertheless sent a note to a certain person, giving forceful orders\nthat were to be obeyed immediately._\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11\n\n\nAt that thought, fear struck at George Hanlon's vitals, almost like a\nphysical blow. What was planned for _him_?\n\nFor certainly if these unknowns were onto what the Terrans--or the\nCorps and the secret service--were trying to do here, and had already\ncaptured and tortured three of the four, they would not leave him free\nto continue working against them.\n\nCold sweat starting from all his pores, Hanlon sank into a chair, nails\ndigging into palms. His bravado, his cockiness, his belief in his own\nsuperiority--all ebbed away like a swift-falling tide.\n\nHe had been used to working alone in the service. He had been mostly\nby himself on Simonides, and altogether alone on Algon. Yet he had not\nfelt such an _aloneness_, such an absolute withdrawal of all support,\nas he knew in this awful moment.\n\nFor at the other places he could contact the S S through the safety\ndeposit boxes, or by the \"Andromeda Seven\" password, and get almost\ninstant response, and the entire resources of the Corps to back him\nup. And here on Estrella, while he had been working alone, he met\nthe others occasionally, and the men with the Corps' sneakboat every\nfortnight. He had known they were _there_.\n\nBut now they were gone. And Hanlon was to be the next victim ... and\nhe had no idea who, when, what, where, or why.\n\nFor long minutes he sat, shaking with dread, his mind a chaos of\nnothingness but a swirling, roiling, panic fear.\n\nThis was far, far different from that terrible fear he had known back\non the _Hellene_ when he had first realized he was tangling with\ntrained, unprincipled and viciously-conscienceless killers. Or the time\nhe had been chained in the Prime Minister's dungeon on Simonides. For\nthen he had been facing known problems. This one was totally\nunknown ... and man has always felt far more fear of the terrors he\ncannot see, than of those he can face.\n\n\"Blast back,\" he thought determinedly, ashamed of his fear and resolved\nto conquer it, \"I got through those other troubles all right in the\nend. How do I know I won't with this? At least, I can be a man, not a\ncry-baby, especially before I'm actually in danger.\"\n\nIt was sorry advice, and he knew it, but it was just enough at the\nmoment to help him pull himself together.\n\n\"So maybe they can kill me ... after torturing me. So what? I don't\nexpect to live forever, and I knew when I got into this service that it\nwas dangerous. After all, I could get killed any minute just performing\nroutine Corps duties--or if I'd remained a civilian, at my daily job,\nor walking the streets of Terra.\"\n\nBy main force of will and character, Hanlon forced the fear back and\naway from the surface of his mind. He concentrated on the problem at\nhand:\n\nHow to find where his father was held captive.\n\nHooper had apparently been running for about two hours when Hanlon\nfirst discovered him, his mind had told. All right, where's that map of\nStearra and vicinity he had bought. Ah, there on the table. Let's see\nnow, a man in Hooper's condition could run maybe ten or twelve miles\nin that time, since his mental terror would have overcome physical\nfatigue until his muscles could absolutely obey no longer.\n\nAll right, circle this point with a ring with a twelve-mile radius ...\nso.\n\nBut Curt was coming from the south. Concentrate on that direction for\nthe moment. What lies ten to twelve miles from here to the south?\n\nHe examined the map carefully, trying to visualize in his mind what lay\nout in that direction. The Ruler's palace was more or less south, but\nnearer to fifteen miles. Could Hooper have run that far since dawn?\nHanlon didn't think so, though the man had so evidently been running\nuntil almost exhausted.\n\nThe section Hanlon was visualizing was, he remembered now, mostly\nfilled with the larger homes and estates of the more influential and\nwealthy.\n\nYandor's house? No, that was more to the west, and only about two miles\nfrom here. Of course, Hooper could have been circling and zigzagging\nduring those hours--oh, but not that much, surely.\n\nCarefully Hanlon pored over the map, trying to figure where his father\ncould possibly be held.\n\nSuddenly, a bit to the east, and about eleven miles from the street\nwhere Hanlon lived, he noticed a pencilled dot he had previously made\non the map.\n\n_Irad's house!_\n\nOf course, Hanlon gasped. And that enigmatic stone building--Hooper\nhad thought \"stone\"--behind the house. Also, all indications up to\nthe present pointed toward the Second-In-Line as the head man of the\ncriminal element ... and that probably meant of the opposition, as well.\n\nBut Hooper's thoughts had been that the S S men's torture and\ninquisition had been mental. Did Irad have that power? Hanlon had asked\nhimself that before, but now it became increasingly evident that he\ndid, he must have. Besides, now that Hanlon was concentrating on the\nsubject, there had been that curious sensation of a mental block or\nbarrier Hanlon thought he had felt in Egon-Irad's mind. What was behind\nthat curtain?\n\n\"Well,\" Hanlon shivered, \"there's only one way to find out. I'll have\nto scout this place more closely, and see if he's _it_.\"\n\nHe rose determinedly to start out. But halted as he realized it was\nbroad daylight, and that he could not go there and investigate the\nhouse and grounds--and that stone building in the back--without being\nseen. He would have to take this slow and easy. Too much depended on\nhim, and there was very little chance of his making it undiscovered\neven under the best of circumstances. He must not take chances that he\nknew beforehand were doomed to failure. For he was now the sole and\nonly possibility of his father being freed. That sneakboat was not due\nfor another week and a half, and with Manning and Hooper out of the\npicture....\n\nChafing at the delay, his mind a turmoil of tortured thoughts, conflict\nbetween his desire to rush and the logical knowledge that he must wait\nuntil dark, Hanlon passed the most miserable time of his young life.\nHe had thought he had plumbed the depths of mental agony during those\ndreadful seven minutes when he had stood at rigid attention in the\noffice of Admiral Rogers, commandant of cadets. But that had been a\nmere child's game compared to all this fretful waiting.\n\nBut those deep, inner and innate characteristics which made George\nHanlon what he was, came to the fore during those hours, as he forced\nhimself to endure the wait he knew he must accomplish.\n\nAnd in that period George Hanlon reached closer to full maturity.\nHe touched, examined and accepted the tremendous concept that man's\nhighest pinnacle of success, his greatest heights of achievement in\npersonal integration, lay in working _with_ others for the common\ngood of all, not in feeling that any one man is indispensable; one\nman--himself, of course--better than others, and more capable than\nthey of achieving all goals.\n\nSure, he had an ability none of the others had. But that did not\nmake him any better than, nor above them. They, in turn, had many\ncapabilities he did not possess, that were actually as valuable as his\nmental abilities--if not more so. As an individual, any of them could\nfail. As a _team_, each giving of his best, they could win out.\n\nAnd now someone or some group had broken up the team. Well, it was up\nto him to get it back together again.\n\nGeorge Hanlon suddenly awoke. He sprang from his chair, astonished to\nsee through the window of his room that it was dark outside. He grinned\nmirthlessly. He had actually fallen asleep there in his chair, in the\nmidst of all his worry.\n\nThen suddenly he realized why. He had thought the matter through,\nreached definite conclusions and had known, inwardly, that everything\nwas now as it must be until a certain time. Thus calmed and facing that\nfact, however unconsciously, he had fallen asleep to gain strength for\nthat coming ordeal. Now it was time to go, therefore he had awakened.\n\nHe took another half hour to prepare and eat a good meal--he would\nneed all the strength he could get--then left his room and the house.\nMounting his trike, he sped away at its swiftest pace toward the\nneighborhood where Adwal Irad's house lay.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_The alien, watching from above in its scanners, saw that entity with\nthe unreadable mind leave its home and start away on its mechanical\ncarrier. Tracing its course, the being was soon able to make a shrewd\nguess as to its destination._\n\n_Instantly the alien's mind went into action, and under its compulsion\nfour armed men hastened to Irad's house, and hid themselves within its\npartially-darkened interior, yet kept careful watch of the outside\npremises._\n\nHanlon had long since decided just how to approach the place. Leaving\nhis machine concealed in the deep shadows of a spreading flowertree, he\nslipped quietly through the edge of the grounds next door, dodging from\ntree to tree to bush, carefully watching all about to make sure he was\nnot seen nor followed.\n\nHe came to a large tree close to the Irad property, hurdled a low hedge\nand dashed across the dividing line, to come to a stop beneath another\ntree well into the grounds of the Second-In-Line. From that one he made\nhis cautious, soundless way, until he was only about ten yards from the\nhouse itself.\n\nThere were only a couple of lights showing through the windows, but his\nheart sank at the realization that someone was at home.\n\n\"I should have had a bird watching to see if Irad left,\" he scolded\nhimself. But he continued on, making a final dash across the remaining\nyardage until he was right beside the house itself, in a deep shadow.\n\nCarefully he inched his way along toward the nearest window from which\na light showed. Reaching it he very slowly rose and peered through the\nlower corner of the pane.\n\nThis was apparently a sort of living room or library, as he could see a\nnumber of easy chairs, carbide lamps on standards for reading, a couple\nof small tables with art objects or flowers on them. Along one wall\nwere recesses holding reading scrolls. But there was no one in the room\nhe could see.\n\nHe crept on to another window, and repeated his inspection. This one\nwas a bedroom, but again no one was there.\n\n\"Maybe Irad just leaves a couple of lights on when he's away,\" Hanlon\nconsidered. He crept on to another window, but there was no light and\nhe could not see what was within. He rounded a corner of the five-sided\nhouse, going toward the back, but there were no lighted windows in\nthat side. He ran along it to the back, noting as he did so that he\npassed a closed door.\n\nHe now was close to that little stone building at the rear which he had\npreviously noted, and in which he was sure his father was imprisoned.\nThere was no light showing, and apparently no windows at all. He\nran toward it swiftly, and ducked into its shadow. He circled it\ncompletely, but there was only one door--locked.\n\nGeorge Hanlon probed with his mind toward the interior, and faintly,\njust barely on the threshold of his consciousness, he caught a familiar\nthought-pattern.\n\n\"It is dad,\" he exulted, but silently. Almost forgetting caution, he\ndoubled back and was attacking that locked door, when a sound behind\nmade him whirl about.\n\nA number of men were boiling swiftly out of that door in the main house\nhe had passed a few moments before. And the light now shining out\nreflected on the unmistakable flameguns in their hands. In that first\nquick glance he had recognized Yandor as one of the men.\n\n\"Yipe!\" Hanlon knew a deep disappointment--which did not stop him from\nstarting away from there on a dead run. He increased his speed as he\nheard the pounding of heavy feet behind him.\n\nHe dashed toward the nearest yard, trying always to keep in the\nshadows. Fortunately, he was fleeter than his pursuers, and gained\nconsiderable yardage on them.\n\nAround that next house he ran, and across the next yard. A couple of\nflamegun flashes sprang out at him, but not close. The gangsters were\nalso flashing the lights from reflector-lanterns, trying to locate and\nspotlight him for more accurate shooting.\n\nIn the drive of that neighboring house Hanlon saw one of the Estrellan\nmotor-trikes. It took him but a moment to activate the engine that, for\na wonder, caught almost immediately. He jumped onto the seat and was\npicking up speed as he reached the street and swung down it.\n\nBehind he heard an outcry as the owners saw the theft of their machine.\nAlso, the angry yells of the men chasing him.\n\nThese little tricycles were made for local trips only, and were not\npowered for speed or distance. The best he was able to coax out of the\nacetylene-powered engine was about twenty miles an hour.\n\nHe had not gone a mile before he heard behind him the sound of one of\nthe larger trikes, whose greater-sized motor, he knew, had a top speed\nof nearly thirty miles an hour.\n\nPushing his little machine as fast as it would go, Hanlon looked wildly\nall about him for some place of safety. He knew he had only a few\nminutes before the bigger trike would catch up with him--or at least be\nwithin shooting distance.\n\nBut how had they known he was coming? They must have been lying in\nwait, to have taken him so completely off guard. Else why or how could\nthey have been hiding in semi-darkness, to come rushing out of that\ndoor, their flamers ready to cinder him?\n\nA momentary blackness of fear struck at him, but he threw it off by\nan effort of will. They hadn't caught him yet; and by the great John\nSnyder, they wouldn't!\n\nHah! Off there to the left was a little patch of woods. And just ahead\nwas a corner. He made as though to keep straight on, then swerved at\nthe last moment toward the left. His tires shrieked at the sudden\nbraking and swift turn, and the little machine almost overturned--but\nhe made it.\n\nGlancing back he saw the larger, swifter tricycle hurtle past the\ncorner he had so unexpectedly turned. That would give him a little\nextra leeway, before they could stop, turn around, and come back down\nthe road he was on.\n\nSoon he reached the beginning of the wood, and was in the shadows its\ntrees cast across the road. Luckily, he thought, his little machine\nhad no lights, and it would be that much harder for them to spot him in\nthe darkness.\n\nHe went a little farther, then slowed a bit, swung his right leg over\nonto the left side of the trike, and threw himself off, allowing it\nto continue on without him. How far it would go, unguided, he did not\nknow, but hoped it would be some distance.\n\nGlancing backward over his shoulder as he ran, he saw the lights of the\ngangster's car pass. For some minutes he continued running, zigzagging\na bit around the trees, hoping to get far enough away so they could not\nfind him. As he ran he continued thinking what had happened.\n\n\"Were those goons actually waiting for me?\" It didn't seem possible\nanyone could have suspected him, personally, or have had any idea he\nwas going to be around Irad's house tonight. How could they, possibly.\nHe hadn't told anyone. That unknown mind-power again?\n\nMemory of that _someone_ with the extraordinary mental powers who had\ncaptured and imprisoned and questioned the other S S men, came to him\nand again, involuntarily, he shuddered.\n\nIt probably was not that one or ones, he tried to deny the belief.\nUndoubtedly those gun-carrying men were merely guarding the house on\ngeneral principles, either because Irad was Second-In-Line, or else\nbecause....\n\n\"Gosh, I almost forgot. I'm sure dad's there, for those were his\nthoughts I was just beginning to catch, I know. His mind-texture is\nunmistakable. I'll bet those guys were there as guards for that reason.\nI'll have to....\"\n\nHe stopped short and dodged behind a tree, for his quick ear had\ncaught a crackling in the underbrush behind him. He tried to peer out\nthrough the dimness, but could not see anyone, although he could see\ntwo or three lances of lights that he knew were the reflectors of the\ngangsters.\n\n\"I didn't realize they'd get this close this quick,\" he almost wailed.\n\"I gotta get out of here, but fast.\"\n\nHe started off as quietly as he could. But there were so many fallen\nleaves and dead twigs and branches underfoot that he could not help\nmaking some noise.\n\nSuddenly a lance of flame almost caught him. He dodged quickly again.\nThere was another shot in his general direction that did not hit\nhim--but it did touch a dried, dead branch.\n\nInstantly there was a flare of light as the wood caught fire, and in\nmoments a considerable blaze was started that made further concealment\nimpossible. Only flight was left.\n\nHanlon turned and ran toward the farther edge of the wood. Behind him\nhe could hear footsteps rapidly following, and a voice bellowing, \"Here\nhe is!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12\n\n\nGeorge Hanlon ran as he had never run before, but somehow,\nsurprisingly, that Estrellan native not only kept up with him, but the\nyoung S S man could tell from the sound that he was catching up. This\nguy must be half greyhound, Hanlon thought--although he, himself, was\nslowed down by those huge shoes to which he was not yet too accustomed,\nso that when running he had trouble not stumbling over his own feet. It\nwas hard remembering to keep his legs spread further apart than normal.\n\nHe finally saw just ahead of him the far edge of the wood, and beyond\nthat a great, open meadow. He would be in clear sight out there, unless\nhe could outdistance his pursuers. And this closest one was much too\nnear for that. He would have to stop this gunnie somehow, and now.\n\nHanlon ducked behind a great tree, and peered out carefully. In his\nhands he held a knob of wood he had picked up. Soon he saw the native\ncome running between the trees, straight in his direction.\n\nHanlon took a firmer grip on his club, and raised it above his head.\nThe mobster came alongside the tree, the club came down--hard. One down.\n\nHanlon started on across the meadow then, for the woods was afire and\nhe felt there was no chance of escape that way. He hoped he could find\nsome sort of a hiding place out there--quite sure in his mind he could\nnot outdistance the men following. He zigzagged a bit as he ran, and\nkept looking back over his shoulder from time to time.\n\nHanlon had covered nearly two hundred yards, and was again looking\nback over his shoulder, when suddenly his foot struck something, and\nhe pitched headlong. The breath _whooshed_ out of him as he landed. He\nfelt as though he was a mass of cuts and bruises. He fought to regain\nhis breath, drawing in great gulps of air. His back hurt, and his legs.\nOne arm seemed almost useless.\n\n\"Oh, no, not broken!\" he wailed inwardly. Tentatively he tried to move\nit, and found to his joy that it was only badly jammed. He remembered\nnow, he had landed on that hand.\n\nHe glanced around and saw that he had fallen over a great, exposed\nrock-edge, perhaps a foot high, half as wide, but eight or nine feet\nlong. Despite the inconvenience of dozens of pieces of broken rock on\nthe ground there, he swung his body around so he was lying along the\nlength of the rock, hoping thus to hide a bit while he regained his\nbreath and a measure of strength.\n\n\"If I'm lucky, I can hide here until they leave,\" he panted, striving\nto calm his nerves and slow his breathing. He peered cautiously over\nthe top of the rock, back toward the burning wood.\n\nSoon he saw another of the men emerge carefully from the edge of the\nwood, but a considerable distance away. He watched this fellow as he\ncrept out into the meadow, looking from side to side in his search for\ntheir quarry.\n\nSo intent was Hanlon on watching this man that he did not see nor\nhear the approach of a third man, until the other jumped the stone,\nalmost landing on Hanlon. The S S man could not entirely stifle an\nexclamation, and instantly the man swiveled and shone his light\ndirectly on Hanlon.\n\nSwiftly the Corpsman snaked out his hand, caught the goon's foot and\nyanked. The man fell backward, and Hanlon, injuries forgotten, leaped\nup. But with a lithe, swift movement his attacker was on his feet,\nswinging at Hanlon with the hand holding his lantern. It was, the S S\nman saw now, the fellow he thought he had knocked out with his club.\n\nThe Terran's hands darted out and grabbed the man's other wrist,\npushing it up and away. For in the gyrations of the lamp he had seen\nthat the fellow carried a flamer.\n\nForth and back they wrestled. By dint of extra effort Hanlon kept the\ngun's muzzle pointed away from him. But he realized sickeningly that\nhis antagonist was stronger and heavier than he. For an Estrellan, this\ngoon was really a giant.\n\nHanlon decided on a desperate chance. Instead of pushing _against_ the\nman's strength, he suddenly lunged backward. The goon cursed as he\nstrove to keep his own footing, and pulled back as best he could.\n\nHanlon's reflexes were faster than the mobster's, and he took full\nadvantage of the change of leverage. He twisted half-sideways, and let\ngo with his right hand. He swung with all his strength at the soft\nbelly before him.\n\nThe man grunted and tottered, for he had not quite regained full\nequilibrium. Again and again Hanlon struck. The man staggered, reeled\nbackward. A quick snatch, and Hanlon had the flamer ... and used it.\n\nSwiftly he looked to see if the man he had been watching had noticed\nthe fight--and the flash.\n\nApparently he had, for he was coming on a run. Hanlon snapped a shot\nat him--and missed. An answering lance of flame almost got him. Hanlon\ntried another ... and got only a weak sizzle. The first gunman's\nflamegun was dead.\n\nOnly flight was left. Hanlon dropped the useless weapon and started off\nacross the field as fast as he could run. He had not fully recovered\nhis breath, and every muscle in his body shrieked from that fall and\nhis unusual exertions.\n\nHe stumbled and staggered, but kept on running as fast as he could.\nBehind he could hear the yells of the gunman who was on his trail,\napparently calling to someone else. The beam of the lantern held Hanlon\nalmost steadily.\n\nStill the Corpsman ran. He had no idea what lay ahead, or whether he\nwas running toward safety or into more danger. There was no other cover\nhe could see in the almost-dark--no trees nor bushes. Merely this\nmeadow, almost flat, covered with a sort of blossomy grass not more\nthan two or three inches high. Nor, even if he did find something,\nwould he be long concealed from the lantern and the man who carried it.\n\nHanlon swerved, and ran toward but behind the lantern-carrier, hoping\nthus to elude him. In fact, he had passed behind the fellow before the\nlight-rays picked him out again.\n\nThe beam held him steadily again, and Hanlon could hear those pounding\nfeet coming nearer. A gun flamed out again, and Hanlon felt the\nexcruciating pain of a burn on the side of his arm.\n\n\"Yipe, that was close,\" he gritted as he clamped his other hand over\nthe wound, and tried to increase his speed. Weariness seemed forgotten\nfor the moment, and he was able to spurt ahead.\n\nSuddenly he saw twin beams of stronger light coming across the field to\nintercept him. \"Oh, no,\" he gasped, \"the trike!\"\n\nHe swerved sharply to the right again, and ran on. Ahead he heard a\nstrange sort of roar, and only after a moment or so could identify it.\nIt sounded like the boom of breakers.\n\n\"Am I that near the sea?\"\n\nAgain a sword of flame almost caught him. The car was roaring toward\nhim, closer each second. He knew starkly that death or capture was a\nmatter of moments only.\n\nHis mind had been reaching out, searching for any sort of animal life\nthat might come to his assistance. But in this hour of need even that\navenue of help seemed to have detoured.\n\nThat roar sounded closer--yet curiously distant. Yet he was almost sure\nit was the sound of breaking water. \"If it's close enough, maybe I can\nfind safety there. It's my only hope now,\" he prayed.\n\nHe pounded on and suddenly, almost straight ahead, the nearer of\nEstrella's two moons swung above the horizon. Both moons were far\ncloser to Estrella than Luna was to Terra. Neither was nearly as large,\nbut they gave considerable light, and this nearer moon was almost at\nthe full tonight. Hanlon could see better now--but he knew his pursuers\ncould, too, and that he was now plain in their sight.\n\n\"Sorry, dad, but it looks like I've failed,\" he groaned.\n\nThe sound of the water was closer now, and it had more the texture\nof breakers than of surf. He devoutly hoped so. Breakers would mean\nrocks, and rocks would be hard to avoid if he had to dive. But, more\nimportant, they would mean greater chances for safety if this meadow\nran directly into them, so he could find a hiding place.\n\nNow both gunmen behind were closer. They were firing steadily--and\neven in his anxiety to escape Hanlon found time to sneer at their\nmarksmanship. \"Wish I had a gun or a blaster--I'd show them some real\nshooting.\"\n\nAlmost blinded now with fatigue, and his run barely more than a\nstagger, he struggled on ... and suddenly skidded to a halt just on\nthe lip of a sharp drop-off. He peered downward, and his heart did\nflip-flops. This cliff was well over a hundred and fifty feet high--and\nstraight down to the water's edge. It was the slapping of the water\nagainst it he had heard.\n\nEven in the moon's rays he could see that it was too vertical, too\nsmooth, for a swift downward climb. He looked wildly to right and to\nleft, but could see no possible safety.\n\nThe car with its gunmen was closer now, and one of the flames from\ntheir guns almost hit him. There was only one possible escape.\n\nHe ran back from the cliff's edge for several yards, straight toward\nthe onrushing car. Then he turned and sprinted for that edge. He took\noff like a broad jumper, as far outward as he could, curving his body\ndownward into a dive.\n\n\"Oh, God, please,\" he prayed earnestly, \"deep water and no rocks.\"\n\nIt seemed an interminable age that George Hanlon fell through the air\non that incredible dive toward the water so far away. Not knowing what\nwas below made the moments seem dreadful eternities. His mind persisted\nin painting ghastly pictures....\n\nAt long last Hanlon struck--and was instantly numbed from the force\nof the blow and chilled by the icy water. His bruises, burns and cuts\nsmarted painfully from the salt. He plummeted into the depths, deeper,\ndeeper, until he thought his lungs would burst, despite the great gulp\nof air he had breathed in just before he hit. Slowly he let out a\nlittle bit--and as he sank ever deeper, a bit more. He just couldn't\ntake it any longer. He would have to let go soon, and try to breathe.\n\nBut from some hidden source he drew on new reserves of will and of\nstrength, and fought on. He felt his descent slowing, and clawed his\nway upward.\n\nHis head finally burst through the surface, and he trod water while he\ngratefully gulped in the reviving air.\n\nAll at once he heard a sharp _ping_, and water splashed in his face.\nOne of those goons above had a pellet gun.\n\nHanlon struck out away from the shore, swimming under water as fast\nand as far as his breath and strength would allow, coming up only to\ngulp another lungful of air, then submerging again. Finally he surfaced\nand looked back toward the cliff-top. He could dimly see three forms\nstanding there.\n\nAnother pellet struck close by ... and another. Why, he wondered,\nhadn't they used that gun on him before?\n\nNever too strong a swimmer, the exhaustion and weakness of his\nwounds and that long run made swimming almost impossible for the\nyoung secret serviceman. But he knew his life--and the success of his\nmission here--depended on his keeping going. He kicked off the heavy,\nwater-logged special shoes that made his feet look Estrellan. Ridding\nhimself of their weight helped a little.\n\nHe had felt hundreds of tiny waves of strange thought beating at\nthe fringes of his mind, and now he opened it wide to receive these\nimpressions.\n\n\"Fish,\" he said disgustedly after a moment, as he kept swimming further\nout. \"What good...?\" He stopped and thought carefully. \"If it was a big\nenough fish, maybe....\" He sent his mind purposefully out and around.\n\nHe was still trying to swim, but his body was worn out. He knew\ndesperation, for even if he outdistanced their pellets, there was just\nnot enough strength left in him to swim back to shore. He turned over\non his back and floated, resting as much as possible, but still kept\nhis mind searching, searching through the waters. It was his only\nchance, he felt sure, and sent it ever farther out.\n\nFinally he contacted a larger, stronger thought. Avidly he seized it,\ninsinuated his mind into it, and realized at once that it was the brain\nof a fish. He forced it to swim at its top speed toward him. From the\nsize and texture of the mind it felt like a large fish. He hoped it was\nbig enough.\n\nSoon it came up to him, and he saw that it was shark-like, almost eight\nfeet long, but rounder, and with a head and face much like that of a\nTerran sea-elephant. Eagerly and thankfully he grasped one of the small\nfins protruding from its underside, and his mind started it swimming\nalong parallel to the coast.\n\nThe musket-type gun had been _splatting_ at him from time to\ntime--evidently as fast as the shooter could reload. He looked up\ntoward the cliff-top, and could see men running along it.\n\n\"Must be they can see me,\" although he doubted if they could see\nthe fish, that swam just below the surface. \"Probably,\" he grinned\nmirthlessly, \"they're wondering how I can swim so fast.\"\n\nAnother pellet plowed into the water close ahead of his face. The\nportion of his mind inside the fish felt the intolerable, burning shock\nof pain. The fish seemed almost to stumble. It twisted and coiled about\nuntil Hanlon was able to tighten his control and calm it.\n\nIn the dim moonlight he could see the water becoming discolored--and\nknew the fish was bleeding profusely.\n\nHis mind in the fish knew where the wound was, and Hanlon reached up\nfor that place and found a gaping hole. He put the tip of a finger\ninto it to stop the bleeding as much as possible. But he realized at\nonce that this would not save his carrier, which by now he knew was\nnot a true fish, but an amphibious mammal, just as Terran's whales are\nmammals, not fish.\n\nWhat could he do? As weak as he was, and as poor a swimmer as he was\nat best, there was absolutely no chance of his making it back to shore\nunder his own power. And even if he did get back, there was no beach,\nonly that unscalable rocky escarpment ... and the gunmen on top of that.\n\nThe fish was his only hope, for he had not been able to locate another\nfish-mind of the same calibre. And now his savior was dying.\n\nMore carefully now, with his mind inside the amphibian, he examined the\nstructure of its brain and nervous and muscular systems. Would it be\npossible to close that terrible wound?\n\nHe traced the nerves to the muscles of that portion of the body and\nskin. He tested and tried everything he could figure out.\n\nFinally, Hanlon found the nerve-muscle combination that controlled\nexactly that portion of the body. He made it contract--and felt the\nmuscle tighten about his fingertip. Gently he withdrew the latter from\nthe wound, and made the muscles close it tightly and completely. It was\nnecessary to keep doing it consciously, for the moment he relaxed his\nconcentration it opened again.\n\nHe noted subconsciously that there had been no more shots for some\ntime. \"Maybe the guy's outta bullets,\" he thought. \"Or perhaps they\nthink I'm dead--can see the blood-stains and think they're mine. Or\nmaybe,\" as an after-thought, \"they've lost track of me in the dimness\nand the choppy waters.\"\n\nWhatever the reason, Hanlon knew a deep thankfulness. He relaxed as\nbest he could, shivering in the icy waters, still holding loosely onto\nthe fin of the fish-thing.\n\nHe did not try to make it swim. In fact, he kept it from doing so. He\nwould take time out to try to regain some of his own strength, while\nletting the fish overcome, if possible, some of its own weakness and\nshock from the pellet-wound.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Adwal Irad had been growing strangely worried. Acting on a compulsion\nhe did not realize existed, he moved Admiral Newton to a different and,\na certain being in a spaceship high above hoped, a more concealed place\nof imprisonment._\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13\n\n\n\"If I wait here awhile, perhaps the fish's strength will build up\nagain,\" George Hanlon had thought wearily. \"Then it can carry me back\nto shore.\"\n\nSo he continued concentrating on the job of keeping those muscles\nclosed around the wound in the amphibian's side, finding it required\nfull use of his mind to think of holding that constriction, and of\nnothing else.\n\nOnly partially was that possible, of course. Humans are just not\nconstituted so they can think of only one thing for long periods of\ntime. \"At least,\" he grimaced, \"not this human.\"\n\nFor nearly an hour he and the fish lay there quietly, riding out the\nwaves, while he waited for the great mammal-thing to regain some of its\nenergy. He kept close watch of that mind, and knew it was gradually\nfeeling less pain, less anguish. He had sent it \"calming\" thoughts as\nbest he could, and they had taken effect. The panic was gone. It was\nalmost asleep, floating there.\n\nHanlon looked toward the cliff-top, but there were no longer figures\nthere he could see. Had the pursuers, thinking him dead, left? He\nstrained his ears for the sound of the trike motor.\n\n\"Maybe, though, they'd already gone before I thought to start\nlistening,\" he thought.\n\nFinally he decided the fish was strong enough to take him to shore. His\nown body felt so much more comfortable. Then he realized with a twinge\nof panic that the reason was that while he had thrown his mind into\nthe healing of the fish his body had become numb with the cold. Now\nhe again became conscious of his various cuts and bruises, aching and\nflaming from the action of the salt water.\n\nUnder his compulsion the fish swam slowly and with some difficulty back\ntoward the shore. When it finally got close to the wall of rock Hanlon\nlet his feet downward, hoping to be able to touch bottom. But the water\nwas far too deep there.\n\n\"I hate to do this to you, fellow, but you're my only hope for the\ntime being,\" Hanlon said feelingly to the great fish-thing, and made\nit start swimming along the rocky wall. He kept his eyes constantly\nlooking ahead for a break in the escarpment, or for a bit of beach\nwhere he could rest.\n\nAfter a mile or so it seemed the cliff was getting lower, and Hanlon's\nhopes rose a bit. Another couple of thousand yards, and he was sure of\nit. It was sloping downward quite sharply toward sea-level. Also it\nseemed, in the moonlight, that the rocky surface was getting rougher,\nmore climbable.\n\nFinally they came to a place where the cliff was only about twenty\nyards high--nor did it seem to get lower on ahead. Too, it looked\nscalable. Hanlon stopped the fish and examined that facing carefully.\n\nYes, he decided at last, there were enough protuberances and cracks so\nthat it could be climbed.\n\n_If_ he had strength enough.\n\n\"Well, gotta try sometime. And my poor fish is about all done.\" He made\nit swim right up until he could reach out and get a firm grip in a\nlarge crack.\n\n\"Goodbye, fellow. Thanks for saving my life. Hope you make out all\nright,\" he told the great mammalian shark-thing. He released his hold\non its fin and his control from its mind. It turned and swam away,\nstill feebly.\n\nHanlon focused his attention on the task before him. Slowly and\npainfully he climbed, hunting for handhold and foot rest.\n\nHe had known he was tired, but had not realized how weak he was. It\nseemed he could never make even that short climb. His fingers, hands\nand arms were numb with cold, his feet and legs unresponsive leaden\nweights. But from the deeps of his subconscious and will, and his urge\nto survival, he brought renewed strength and scrambled upward.\n\nAt last, utterly spent, he pulled himself over the edge, and lay\ngasping and shivering on the top of the cliff.\n\nHe was almost ready to blank out, when a thought struck him, and he\nstruggled to retain consciousness. He could not just lie here and\nsleep. Probably those goons would still be looking for him. He must get\naway, somehow, somewhere.\n\nAgain he sent his mind outward, and felt whispers of thought quite\na little distance away across the meadow. He followed the strongest\nof these, and found a mind quite powerful, and intelligent in an\nanimalistic way.\n\nHe followed that mind into the brain that housed it, and took control.\nHe made the animal, whatever it was, start swiftly toward him. While it\nwas coming he examined the mind more closely, and suddenly realized he\nwas inside the brain of an Estrellan _caval_.\n\nThese animals, which the Terrans thought of as horses, because they\ncould be ridden or trained to draw carriages, were about the size of a\nTerran cow-pony. They were striped almost like a zebra, but the colors\nwere brown and yellow, rather than black and white. The animals were\nquite vicious in the wild state, and none too tractable even when\ntrained. As usual with Estrellan animals, they were tailless, and had\nheavy, sharp hooves, nearly twice the size of those of Earthly horses,\nand snouts much like a roch's.\n\nWhen the caval came up to him, Hanlon saw it was a stallion, slightly\nlarger than average. From its mind he already knew it was a wild one,\nnot domesticated or broken to saddle or harness.\n\nNevertheless, he could control it, and made it stand quietly while he\nclimbed slowly and laboriously to his feet, and from there managed to\nwriggle onto its back.\n\nHe knew he was due to faint in a few seconds, but kept his\nconsciousness long enough to impress on the animal's mind that it was\nto take him back toward Stearra. He thought he knew the direction,\nand he thought he could keep awake the one part of his mind that was\ndissociated and in the caval. However, because he might blank out\ncompletely, he instructed it to keep straight on the road to town.\n\nHe leaned down and threw his arms tightly about the caval's neck, then\nwith a sigh of thankfulness, let himself go. He had endured so much ...\nhe was so tired ... so ... tir....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nYandor and his men had finally come to the conclusion that Gor Anlo was\ndead, out there in the ocean. They had been unable to see him for some\ntime. Yet they waited around for nearly half an hour, searching both\nthe waters and along the cliff. Finally, he said they might as well go\nhome. So all piled in their large trike and started back to the city.\n\nBut they had not quite reached his home when Yandor found a disturbing\nthought persisting in his mind. He worried and puzzled over it for some\ntime, then issued sharp commands. Thus, when they arrived at his house,\ntwo of the men hurried into the back yard, and soon came back with two\nof the beasts Yandor kept caged there.\n\n\"What's up, chief?\" one of the men asked as the tricycle sped back the\nway they had just come.\n\n\"I ... I don't really know,\" the impresario said slowly. \"I ... I have\na ... a sort of feeling ... that maybe we can find Anlo after all. We'd\nbetter go back and look some more.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_For the watcher above knew Hanlon was not dead._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll of George Hanlon's mind must have become unconscious, for the next\nthing he knew was when the caval suddenly reared to escape those who\nwere trying to stop it, and Hanlon's body was dumped unceremoniously to\nthe ground. The caval, released from its compulsion, took off across\nthe meadow at top speed.\n\nHanlon began to recover consciousness as rough hands slapped him awake.\nHe first noticed that the sun was rising, for its rays were shining\ndirectly in his eyes. He blinked and turned his head away--and became\naware of his captors.\n\nHe saw Ino Yandor standing there, beside a large trike. Beside him was\none of his henchmen, holding the leashes of two straining _tamous_.\nThese cat-like beasts, somewhat like Terran black panthers save they\nwere a deep red in color, and had fangs much longer and sharper--and\nno tails--Hanlon knew to be trackers _par excellence_--as good as\nbloodhounds. Nor were they usually as fierce and blood-thirsty as they\nseemed.\n\nThe third man was the one who was holding him.\n\n\"Well now,\" Yandor eyed him angrily, \"you think you're pretty clever,\ndon't you?\"\n\nHanlon shrugged. \"Doesn't look like it, does it?\"\n\n\"Who are you spying for?\"\n\n\"Who says I was spying?\"\n\n\"Don't try to quibble with me, Gor Anlo. I want answers, and correct\nanswers, or I'll let my pretty pets here take over, and see if you can\nelude them.\"\n\n\"And after I get through answering you'll cinder me anyway,\" Hanlon\nsneered. \"Whatever gave you the idea I'd talk--if I had anything to\nsay, that is?\"\n\nThe mobster holding him cuffed him. \"Don't talk to Ino Yandor that way,\nyou phidi.\"\n\nHanlon turned his head and sneered into the man's face. \"Watch who\nyou're calling a snake.\" He twisted suddenly, drove his heel backwards\ninto the man's shin, and pulled free. The fellow, even while yelping\nwith pain, started to draw a flamer when Yandor commanded sharply, \"Let\nhim be. He can't outrun the tamous.\"\n\nHanlon spoke as though nothing had happened. \"What gave you the idea\nI've been doing anything like you said?\" he asked in a conversational\ntone. \"What's this all about?\"\n\n\"What were you doing, trying to look into--or get into--Adwal Irad's\nhouse?\"\n\n\"That the name of the guy that owns it? Just looking for anything\nworthwhile I could pick up. Since you got me fired just because I drank\na little too much one night, I got to make a living someway.\"\n\n\"Well now, I hope you don't expect me to believe that. I know who you\nare, and my patience is at an end. Do you tell me who you are working\nfor, and what you're after, or do I let the tamous loose?\"\n\n\"I've got nothing to ...\" Hanlon began, but the man who had been\nholding him suddenly interrupted.\n\n\"Look, Yandor, at the man's ear!\"\n\n\"Yes, and his feet,\" the other pointed downward.\n\nThey all stared closely, and Hanlon wondered as he saw their eyes\nwiden. Then, with a start, he remembered kicking off his oversized\nshoes, and now he noticed that the dye had come off his hands. He\nguessed with sickening certainty that the long immersion in the\nsalt-water had also loosened the plastic ears and nose, and that at\nleast one of them had fallen off.\n\n\"By Zappa,\" Yandor stepped closer. \"One of his ears is very small ...\"\nhe reached out quickly and tugged at the other. Loosened at it was, it\ncame off easily in his hand.\n\n\"An alien,\" Yandor exclaimed, and then \"your skin--it's not like ours.\"\n\n\"His nose seems false, too,\" the third man said.\n\nKnowing his imposture was over, Hanlon himself pulled off the plastic\noverlay and disclosed his nose in its original size and shape.\n\n\"Yes, I'm a Terran. What're you going to do about it?\"\n\n\"Loose the tamous!\" Yandor snapped, and the man dropped the leashes he\nheld.\n\nBut Hanlon had read that command in the impresario's mind even before\nhe uttered it, and had already taken over the minds of the two beasts.\n\nThey were well equipped by nature to be deadly, even if that was not\ntheir true nature.\n\nThe female whirled, and jumped on the man who had been holding them.\nThe male made two quick leaps, and was on the other gunman. Both men\nwere borne backwards, and in seconds the great cat-things had torn out\ntheir throats.\n\n\"You should have remembered I'm the world's greatest animal trainer,\"\nHanlon said evenly.\n\nYandor shrank back, sure he was next. \"You fiend!\" he cried, then his\ninherent cowardice showed and he threw himself on his knees. \"Don't let\nthem kill me,\" he pleaded in agonized tones. \"I'll do anything--I'll\ngive you everything I have. Only please, please keep those awful beasts\naway from me.\"\n\nHanlon hated a cowardly bully. Also, much as he detested killing or\nmaiming, he had learned not to let it get him down too much in this\nwork when it was necessary. But with such an unprincipled killer and\nabject wretch as the one before him, he felt no such compunction. He\nlooked contemptuously down at the thing grovelling at his feet in a\nvery paroxysm of fear.\n\nDisgusted, Hanlon turned away, climbed into the motor-trike in which\nYandor and his men had come here, and started its engine. As he drove\naway he impressed a command on those now-slavering beasts, who began\nbellying toward the helpless Yandor. But Hanlon could not repress a\nshudder of revulsion at what he felt forced to do.\n\nAfter a half mile or so of driving, however, the weariness, the pain\nand chill struck him, and he nearly fainted again. He struggled to\nkeep himself conscious so he could get back home--a matter of vital\nnecessity now that he was not disguised.\n\nWhen he finally came to the more populated part of the city, in\nwhich people were beginning to be seen outside the houses and on the\nstreets, he had himself fairly well under control. He kept his head\ndown and made himself as inconspicuous as possible while driving at\nthe highest allowable speed toward his rooming house. There he jumped\nfrom the car almost before it stopped, and ran in. He passed several of\nhis neighbors in the hallways, but held his hank before his face and\nignored their stares of surprise at his condition as he raced to his\nroom.\n\nOnce inside, he locked the door, then breathed a sigh of deep relief.\nHe began stripping off his wet and bedraggled clothes, thankful, as he\nremembered the loss of his shoes, that he had an extra pair of those\nspecially-made ones.\n\nWhen he saw that much of the hair so meticulously glued onto his body\nwas also coming loose, he thankfully ripped the rest of it from him,\nthen went in and turned on the shower--really only a stream of water\nfrom the end of a pipe. For nearly a quarter of an hour he stood under\nit, revelling in the first feeling of real cleanliness he had known\nsince leaving Simonides, relieved as the warm water washed the salt\nfrom his wounds and pores.\n\nFinally, having treated his burns and bruises, he put on a dressing\ngown to partially cover his nakedness, and sank into his comfortable\nchair. Then he let his mind review the happenings of the past night.\n\nHanlon was once more in a cockily jaunty mood. He had taken some\nterrific risks, had been in almost-fatal jeopardy several times,\nhad had adventures and escapes no one would believe if he tried to\ntell them--except some of the few S S men who knew about his special\ntalents, and dad, of course....\n\n_Dad!_ He had almost forgotten his father's predicament in the\nexcitement of the night. Now, as he considered and concentrated on this\nproblem, Hanlon began to realize--dimly, sketchily, and much against\nhis will--that things were not at all right as he had felt for the\nmoment.\n\nHe tried to dodge that flickering thought, but it persisted, grew\nstronger, would not be denied. He finally was forced to consider\nit more thoroughly. And slowly it dawned upon him that he had not\n_won_--he had lost. He had smeared up the works, but good. His campaign\nwas done, finished, kaput. He had put his foot in it, clear up to the\nsacro-iliac.\n\nWorse than that--far worse--he had undoubtedly gummed up this whole\nEstrellan business. Not only was his own work undone, but now the\nnatives would know that the Terrans were here, just as that propaganda\nmachine had said. Now it would be practically impossible to make\nthem believe that the Terrans were _not_ responsible for their crime\nwave--and all the other things said about them.\n\n\"Me and my big swelled head,\" he castigated himself furiously. \"I\noughtta be horse-whipped.\"\n\nAlmost he cried. His body was by turns ice-cold and feverish. He\ncringed mentally and physically.\n\nWas there any way--any possible way--he could redeem himself? Could\nhe publicly admit that he and he alone was to blame, that he was here\nentirely on his own initiative, because he wanted to see Estrella join\nthe family of nations?\n\nNo, that was absurd. He wouldn't be believed. No one in their right\nmind would ever conceive that a young man like him would do such a\nthing without some backing--undoubtedly full Federation backing.\n\nHe would have to resign from the secret service. Or--he gasped--were\nits members allowed to resign? Admiral Rogers had said it was for life,\nonce he got in.\n\n\"But he didn't guarantee how long my life would last,\" Hanlon grimaced.\n\nWell, he drew himself up proudly, there was a way. He was not afraid to\ndie.\n\n\"Whoa, now, wait a minute. Let's think this out. Death's no answer.\"\nFor a new idea had just struck him. He forced the worry, the fear,\nthe ... the self-pity ... from his mind, and settled down to consider\nthis new concept. Maybe it wasn't as bad as he had thought, after all.\n\n\"Yandor and his goons were the only ones who knew I was a Terran, and\nthey're dead,\" he thought. \"So they can't tell on me. And no one else\nknows it. Maybe I can go ahead, just as I was.\"\n\nHe rose to get dressed. There was still his father's imprisonment to\nbe taken care of--if possible. Hanlon was sure now that it was in that\nlittle stone house back of Irad's mansion that the admiral was being\nheld prisoner.\n\nA casual glance in the glass, and he was suddenly conscious of his\nappearance. Hey, he couldn't go out like this, in broad daylight. Not\nlooking like a Terran.\n\nSwiftly he considered the possibilities. He would have to disguise\nhimself again enough to escape notice on the street. But he was no\ncosmetician ... even if he had the dyes, the plastics....\n\nHe sank into his chair again, and thought seriously. But even while he\nwas trying to think and plan, his worn, tired body--exhausted as it had\nnever been before, and depleted of all strength--could bear no more.\nWithout even realizing it, he sank parsecs deep into profound slumber.\n\nSometime during the day, without his knowing it, he must have gotten\nup and lain down on the bed, for it was there he finally awoke. The\nroom was dark; only a small ray of light came in obliquely through the\nwindow, from a distant street-light.\n\nHe got up, wincing at his lameness and stiffness. He went through some\ncalesthenics to take the soreness from his body, then washed, dressed,\nand prepared and ate something. He hunted through his duffel bag and\nfound a pair of gloves to cover his hands. Before putting them on,\nhowever, he wound a scarf about his head and face, covering most of it\nexcept his eyes. He pulled his hat well down, then put on the gloves.\n\nLeaving his room, he went inconspicuously along the darkest parts of\nthe streets until he came to the market place, and a certain stall that\nspecialized in theatrical costumes and make-up. It was the same place\nwhere he had bought that roch-mask.\n\nWalking purposefully, as though he had legitimate business there, he\nwent to the rear of the shop. It was not too hard to break in and crawl\ninside. There, using his utmost care not to be discovered, he hunted\nabout among the shelves until he found some facial putty, skin dyes,\nand other articles he needed. He left a couple of gold pentas on the\ncounter in payment.\n\nThen, just as cautiously, he retraced his way to his rooms.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14\n\n\nThe next morning when SSM George Hanlon awoke, his first thought was\none of concern for his father. An impatient, driving urge for action\nseized him and made him jump out of bed. Then logic and clear thinking\ncame to the fore, although it required conscious effort for him to\nprepare and eat his breakfast first of all.\n\nHurriedly finished, though, he set to work on his new make-up, doing\nhis level best to keep his thoughts on the difficult task at hand.\n\nHe had let his whiskers and hair grow from the time he first received\nthis assignment, of course, so was not too much concerned about the\nhairiness he must present to the world when dressed. Luckily, although\nit had often been a source of annoyance--he was one of those men\nwhose beard grows clear down his face and neck to join, with hardly a\nbreak, the hair on his chest. As for the body hair that had been so\npainstakingly glued onto his body before, he decided not to attempt\nthat. He had not yet had to disrobe in front of anyone here; he was\ncertain he would be able to avoid doing so in the future.\n\nHe rubbed liquid rouge, of a dark shade, well into the skin of his\nface, neck, hands and high up on his wrists, which took care of his\ncoloring.\n\nHis main worry was the nose and ears, especially the nose. That\nwould be most quickly noticed if it looked artificial. His first few\nattempts were not only badly done, but almost ludicrous. His usually\nfine muscular coordination seemed to be lacking. But he persevered and\nfinally, after several hours, managed to mold a fairly reasonable snout\nand to so blend its edges into the skin of his face adjoining that it\nwould, he felt sure, pass muster on casual inspection.\n\nHe built up his ears in like manner, but to help with this deception,\nin case of any close scrutiny, he covered them with a head bandage. He\nput his hat on, pulled it well down in front and on the sides, then\nexamined himself critically in the mirror.\n\n\"Boy, that's a sloppy job, and how,\" he exclaimed, disgusted with his\nhandiwork. \"Trevor would disown me if he could see it.\" But he finally\ndecided it would do ... he hoped.\n\nNow that he had finished he discovered he was sweating like a nervous\ncaval. He held out his shaking hands, and looked at them critically.\nWhat, in John's name, was wrong with him, anyway?\n\nAnd a thought he had, perhaps subconsciously, pushed far down into the\nfurthest recesses of his mind, swept over him with full force.\n\nHe did not want to think that thought. More, he did not want to have to\nmake that decision. But....\n\nManning was dead.\n\nHooper was fleeing insanely, perhaps also dead by now.\n\nHis father was captive, imprisoned, tortured ... if still alive.\n\nOnly he, Hanlon, of the four, was left.\n\nAnd he was ... alone.\n\nAgain to his mind came his father's earnest and incisive statement,\nthat getting Estrella to accept membership in the Federation was\nthe most important thing that had come up in ages. It _had_ to be\naccomplished, and quickly.\n\nDeep down Hanlon knew what that meant. Individuals were\nexpendable--the plan was not.\n\nHe was beginning to learn that while plans may blow up in one's\nface--as now--such happenings must be accepted philosophically,\nwithout too much backward longing, without too great remorse, and\ncertainly--which was the hardest to accept--without letting personal\nfeelings or sympathy for those lost or in danger keep the one or ones\nremaining from going ahead with new attempts to bring the mission to a\nsuccessful conclusion.\n\nFor a long time Hanlon sat there. Resolutely now, he put his father out\nof his mind, and concentrated only on how he was to accomplish the task\nthat confronted him--alone.\n\nFinally he began to look at the larger aspects of the problem; to\nrealize that he must quit hunting for individual criminals and possible\nmembers of the opposition, and work from the other end--the top.\n\n\"After all,\" he thought, \"it is the Ruler who makes the decisions.\nPerhaps ... no, I _must_ go to work on him. I've got enough dope now as\nto who is behind this intrigue. Now I must reach Elus Amir himself, and\nswing him our way. But, in Snyder's name, how am I going to get to him?\"\n\nPlan after possible plan he discarded. He could not go to Amir as a\nTerran. In the first place, his word would have no weight. In the\nsecond place, he would undoubtedly have considerable trouble making the\napproach to the Ruler, if it was possible at all.\n\nNo, he would have to get close to him as a native. And to do that,\nhe first had to know more--a lot more--about the Ruler as a man, his\nhabits and usual daily routine.\n\nHanlon left the house and went to a number of places where men ate\nor drank, both for information, and to try out his new disguise. The\nlatter must have been better than he thought, for no one seemed to\nnotice. And in each place he visited, while eating or sipping his mild\ndrink, Hanlon asked one or two discreet questions. None of these, by\nthemselves, seemed to mean anything. But the answers, put together as\nHanlon did when he returned to his rooms, gave him a fairly detailed\npicture.\n\nHe knew now that the Ruler stuck quite closely to his\nresidence--\"palace\", Hanlon thought of it--although occasionally his\nduties took him to other cities on either continent, and sometimes he\nwent out for an evening at the theatre, as he had done on Hanlon's\nopening night.\n\nOtherwise, he was a hard worker, an excellent and well-loved Ruler,\nalways studying carefully all suggested legislation that was presented\nfor his consideration, always thinking of ways to better the condition\nof his people.\n\nBut to one thing he had learned Hanlon gave the most consideration at\nthe moment. Elus Amir, he found, went out almost every day for a ride\non his caval, and usually along the same route. Hanlon knew what road\nthat was.\n\nAccustomed as he now was to thinking more in terms of animals than of\nmen, the natural thought for Hanlon was to wonder how he could meet or\nstudy the Ruler through his caval.\n\nThe next day, therefore, the S S man rode out into the country, and\nposted himself at a convenient spot where he could watch without\nattracting too much attention, yet could see for several miles. He took\none of the wheels off his motor-tricycle and demounted the tire. This\nwas to be his excuse for being so handy at the time of his planned\nmeeting with the Ruler.\n\nBut something apparently changed Elus Amir's habits, for he did not\nride that road that day. Ruefully doing a bit of under-breath griping,\nHanlon replaced tire and wheel, then rode back toward town.\n\nBut after he had gone part way through the city streets, he thought of\nsomething else that must be done, and headed towards the place Morris\nManning had found rooms.\n\nLuckily, no one else had moved in, and no one appeared in the hall\nwhen Hanlon came back, after a quick trip to a tool stall in the\nmarket place, where he was able to buy a hacksaw. For Manning, as did\nthe other S S men, had attached a hasp and pick-proof padlock to his\ndoor. The Estrellans locks were ingenious, but could quite easily be\nunfastened even without the key.\n\nThese locks consisted of a metal rod, like a sliding bolt, that ran\ninside the wood of the door. There was a slip in the wood on either\nside of the door through which a key, inserted in the rod, could move\nit forth or back. When the bolt was moved into position with one end\nseated in the holder in the doorjamb, a turn of the key opened flanges\non the rod that fitted vertically into prepared slots.\n\nBut a little patience easily enabled one who wished to get in, to trip\nthose flanges with almost any small, flat-pointed instrument, even a\npenknife blade.\n\nNow Hanlon cut through the hasp, evidently without attracting anyone's\nattention, for none of the neighbors came out to investigate the\nstrange sounds. Inside Manning's room, he went about the sad business\nof collecting the dead secret serviceman's gear and belongings, to be\nsent back home on the sneakboat.\n\nAs he was cleaning out one of the chests, however, Hanlon discovered a\nsmall notebook he knew was of Estrellan make. He opened it idly, and\nfound it was filled with native writing.\n\nExcited now, for he was sure Manning would have written in Terran or\nI-S C code if it had been his work, Hanlon slowly began deciphering the\nwords.\n\n\"Yow, this is hot stuff,\" he exclaimed after less than a page. \"Wonder\nwhere Morrie got this? From Esbor's office or home, I'll bet.\"\n\nHe stuffed the book into his pocket for later study. He packed the\nbalance of Manning's things, then left, mounted his trike and rode back\nto his own rooms.\n\nAll the balance of the afternoon and evening he worked at the\ntranslation of the entries in that book. It was, he found with great\nglee, a list of the names of various criminals who had been working\nunder Esbor, and brief details of their various activities, as well as\nmany other notes of similar nature.\n\nOne recent item caused a brief exclamation. \"Ran Auldin came seeking a\nsafe hiding place today,\" he read. \"It having already been decided by\nAdwal Irad that the man's usefulness was over, he was cindered.\"\n\n\"Dirty killers,\" Hanlon growled, his brief moment of joy at the direct\nmention of Irad dimmed by the import of that entry. \"No conscience\nwhatever.\"\n\nAll in all, however, he was vastly pleased, and grew more so as he\ncontinued translating. For there were several mentions of Adwal Irad,\nand always pointing to him as the top man. Now he had real evidence\nof what he had believed--that this crime wave was directed by the\nSecond-In-Line. Hanlon was vastly relieved.\n\nIn the morning, as he was preparing to go out again to see if he\ncould contact Amir, a thought sent him to the mirror, attempting some\nchanges in his make-up. He worked subtly and soon made himself look\nconsiderably older--about middle-aged. This, he felt, would make the\nRuler listen more carefully to his evidence than he might to a younger\nman. Then he rode out to that country road.\n\nSometime later he saw Elus Amir riding that way. From Hanlon's vantage\npoint he saw the Ruler and a single groom on their mounts while they\nwere still some distance away.\n\nHanlon's mind reached out and touched that of the Ruler's steed. There\nwere a few moments of anxious trying, and then he was in full control\nof the animal's mind. Through its eyes Hanlon looked out carefully\nalong the road. It seemed fairly smooth, and he felt sure that if Amir\nwas at all a good cavalman--as he must be after riding nearly every\nday--he would be able to stay in the saddle safely during the wild ride\nplanned.\n\nHanlon made the beast suddenly snort and shy to one side, then break\ninto a wild gallop straight down the road, despite the Ruler's frantic\nefforts at control.\n\nSwiftly the caval pounded down the road, Amir working desperately to\ncontrol it, yet seeming not to be too frightened by the runaway. The\ngroom kicked up his own mount, but was hopelessly outdistanced.\n\nMeanwhile the caval, controlled by Hanlon's mind within its own, paid\nno attention to the sawings and pullings on rein and bit, and continued\nits apparently frightened bolt.\n\nAs they neared the place where Hanlon was working on his machine, the\nyoung man straightened, looked, then jumped into the road. He started\ntrotting toward them, waving his arms in an effort to make the caval\nstop its mad rush. But, although he let the animal slow somewhat, it\nkept running wildly.\n\nAs it drew closer, Hanlon moved a bit to one side, but still in the\nroad. When the horse and rider were almost upon him he turned his back\nto them and started running in the same direction, looking back across\nhis shoulder. Just as the caval came abreast, Hanlon suddenly leaped\ntoward it, and grasped the bridle. At the same time his mind calmed\nthat of the beast, and commanded it to slow and stop.\n\nTo the Ruler, Hanlon seemed to be dragged for several yards, still\nholding grimly to the reins he had grasped. When he finally brought the\ncaval to a stop, it stood with heaving flanks and blowing nostrils.\n\n\"Whew,\" Elus Amir wiped his face, \"that was fine work, my man. Many\nthanks. I don't know what got into the stupid beast. It has never done\nthat before.\"\n\n\"Something must have frightened it,\" Hanlon said. He pretended he did\nnot know who the rider was, having considered this point carefully.\n\"Sure you can handle it now?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think there'll be no more trouble. By the way, is there\nanything I can do to show my gratitude?\"\n\nHanlon looked surprised. \"Why, I didn't do anything special. Couldn't\nlet you get hurt.\"\n\nThe Ruler gazed at him peculiarly. \"Don't you know who I am?\"\n\n\"No, should I?\"\n\n\"I am Elus Amir.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Hanlon made himself look properly surprised, then bent his knee\nin the Estrellan salute to the Ruler. \"I beg your pardon, k'nyer, if\nI've spoken wrongly, for I did not know.\"\n\nAmir smiled. \"Well, now that you do, I ask again, is there anything I\ncan do for you? You must want something.\"\n\nHanlon shook his head. \"Thank you, sire, but I wouldn't dream of\nimposing on your generosity. I'm sure I can find a job somewhere.\"\n\n\"Oh, you're looking for work?\"\n\n\"Yes, k'nyer. I only recently came here from Lura.\"\n\n\"What can you do?\"\n\nAnother shrug. \"Farm work, tending animals, that sort of thing. I love\nanimals, especially cavals. I'd hoped to get a job as stableman on one\nof the estates here.\"\n\nThe Ruler looked at his groom who had come galloping up, relieved to\nsee that his master was unharmed, glancing curiously at this stranger\nwho had saved the Ruler, and with whom he could see Amir had been\ntalking.\n\n\"Are there any vacancies in our stable-force, Endar?\" the Ruler asked.\n\n\"Why ... why, no, k'nyer, not at present.\"\n\n\"Make one then,\" snapped Amir. \"I want to give this man a good\nposition. He is to take care of my personal string of cavals.\"\n\n\"As you order, sire.\"\n\n\"I don't like to make trouble for anyone, k'nyer.\" Hanlon protested. \"I\ndon't want a job if it means putting someone else out of work.\"\n\nThe Ruler's eyes lighted up with a friendly smile. \"I assure you it\nwon't. I like your attitude, my man. It is good to find someone who\nthinks of others before himself.\"\n\nOnce more Hanlon shrugged deprecatingly. \"I've found in my lifetime,\nk'nyer, that it doesn't hurt me any to think of the other fellow.\nAnd the best part of it is, I've also found, that when I do so think\nunselfishly, I always receive far more happiness than otherwise.\"\n\n\"Ah, a philosopher. I must have many talks with you. Can you get to the\nResidence all right?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire, as soon as I finish fixing my tire.\"\n\n\"Report to Endar here, then, when you get there. I'll instruct him as\nwe ride back.\"\n\n\"My thanks, k'nyer. I promise to serve you well and faithfully.\"\n\nThe Ruler nodded briefly and rode away, the groom following at a\nrespectful distance. Hanlon hurriedly replaced tire and wheel, then\nrode off toward the palace. Watching through the caval's eyes, he timed\nit so he rode into the courtyard just behind the Ruler and groom.\n\nElus Amir was cordial as he dismounted. \"I see you got here all\nright ... by the way, you never told me your name.\"\n\n\"I am called Ergo Lona, k'nyer.\"\n\n\"All right, Lona. Endar, see that this man has good quarters and\nwhatever clothing he needs. Introduce him to the work.\"\n\n\"As you order, sire.\" The two men bent their knees, then led the cavals\nto the stables as the Ruler went up the steps into the residence.\n\nHanlon noticed the groom was inclined to be a bit surly, and deduced\nthe man was afraid of his job. He determined to make friends, if\npossible. It would hamper his work of spying if he had to watch for\nenemies close to him, like this man could be.\n\n\"Please tell me how I may help, Endar,\" he made his voice cordial, yet\nwith a touch of servility. \"I'm proud that our Ruler has given me work,\nI assure you I want to do everything to make good here. I know you must\nbe important here, to be allowed to ride with K'nyer Amir, and I hope\nyou will teach me the regulations. I realize I can never be anything\nbut a stable helper, but I do want to be a good one. I hope we can\nbecome good friends.\"\n\nThe man unbent a little. \"All right, I'll show you around.\"\n\nThey stabled the cavals and then the groom led Hanlon to a nearby\nbuilding. It was of stone construction, five-sided, surrounded by\nflower beds and trees. It was not only harmonious with the palace and\nother buildings and grounds, but a pretty little house by itself.\n\n\"These are the living quarters for the grooms,\" Endar said as they\nmounted the steps. Inside he pointed out the dining room, then led the\nway upstairs and down a short hall. \"This will be your room,\" he opened\na door, disclosing a small but well-furnished, comfortable room.\n\n\"I have a few things in Stearra,\" Hanlon said. \"When will it be\nconvenient for me to go get them?\"\n\n\"We have lunch in a few minutes, then you might as well go,\" Endar\nsaid. \"I'll give you a note to the official tailor, and have him fit\nyou with the proper clothes.\"\n\nHanlon looked at him as though with new respect. \"Oh, you must be the\nhead groom then, nyer. I hadn't thought about that. Please pardon my\npresumption in suggesting that we be friends.\"\n\nEndar merely looked at him a moment, then turned and left without a\nword.\n\nHanlon grinned to himself as the door closed. \"It won't be too hard to\nkeep ahead of that guy. Only I'll have to watch him all the time, or he\ncould get nasty.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 15\n\n\nHanlon was awakened shortly after dawn the next morning. \"Darn this\nhaving to pretend to such jobs,\" he growled to himself as he rose,\nwashed and dressed. He had always preferred to sleep as late as\npossible, and getting up at such ungodly hours did not tend to make him\ntoo happy the first few hours of the day. Yet, young as he was, he had\ndeveloped the philosophy of accepting what must be as gracefully as\npossible, and now consoled himself with the hope that he would probably\nnot have to keep up this imposture very many days.\n\nHis first care was to examine minutely, in the mirror, the make-up he\nhad applied. The ears and nose still seemed to be all right and holding\ntightly. But he was careful, when no one was around during the days\nthat followed, to look at them as often as he could in a pocket mirror\nhe carried.\n\nAfter a good breakfast in the dining room he was put to work cleaning,\nfeeding and watering the cavals. Endar brought two of the horses from\ntheir stalls, snapped their halters into rings in a post, and was busy\ncurrying them. When he finished he saddled the two and led them out,\nafter first telling Hanlon to make sure the stables were clean, in case\nthe Ruler came to inspect them.\n\nThere were three other stablemen, working at the same general tasks.\nHanlon, without neglecting his own work, made it a point to try to\nengage them in conversation.\n\n\"I love this kind of work, don't you?\" he asked confidingly. \"I'm so\nproud the Ruler gave me this job.\"\n\nAll the time he was studying their surface minds, trying to get a line\non what manner of men they were--whether they would be inclined to\nbe too friendly and intruding. But to his relief, he found they were\nrather stupid, loutish fellows, not caring too greatly what they did\nnor who was working with them, as long as they had a good place to\nlive, plenty to eat, and fair pay. They seemed mildly surprised at his\nevident enthusiasm. One of them answered, in a churlish voice, \"It's\nonly a job--why get so excited about it?\"\n\nHis mind-probings told him, however, that none of them was the type to\nbe involved in any plot that might be going on, even as the most humble\nparticipants or workers. He had nothing to fear from them in any way.\n\nWhen the work was finished for the morning, the other three men went\ninto the tackroom and began playing cards. They ignored Hanlon, not\nasking him to play with them, seemingly not caring what he did.\n\nHe went outside, sought the shade of a large flowertree, and sat\ndown with his back leaning against the bole. He closed his eyes, the\nbetter to concentrate, and strengthened his mental control of the\ncavals ridden by Elus Amir and Endar, in which he had put a smallish\nportion of his mind when they started out. He knew that so far no\nuntoward incident had occurred--the Ruler was riding along that country\nroad, wrapped in thought, not talking, not meeting anyone, paying no\nattention to the groom following him.\n\nHanlon had not expected anything would occur, but wanted to know if it\ndid, and especially wanting to be sure he could perfectly control the\nRuler's caval at all times, no matter what the distance.\n\nEarly the next morning a houseman approached the stables. \"K'nyer Amir\nsays to get his son's caval ready, for he rides with him today.\"\n\nEndar indicated a certain animal to Hanlon. \"Bring that one out and\nget it saddled. The young man's gear is the second set on the right of\nthe door in the tack room.\"\n\nHanlon hurriedly led the caval out, snapped its halter ring in a nearby\npost, then ran to get the blanket, saddle and bridle.\n\n\"Those back legs aren't smooth,\" the head groom snapped. \"Curry and\nbrush them again. Inver is particular.\"\n\n\"Yes, nyer, thank you,\" Hanlon made haste to obey, and was careful in\nhis work. When the beasts were ready, the groom took the reins in his\nhands, and led them to the mounting block.\n\nHanlon implanted parts of his mind in each of the two cavals. Thus he\nwas ready for his spying when the two men came out of the residence.\n\nThrough the eyes, wide set in the only-slightly elongated, broad heads\nof the steeds, Hanlon studied this important new character, of whom\nhe had heard much. He saw a tallish, very intelligent-looking native,\nguessed him to be in his middle or late twenties. The fellow had a\nslight though wiry build, and reddish-blond hair and trimmed beard.\nHanlon liked this Inver on sight, and decided instantly that what he\nhad heard was somehow wrong. The Ruler's son certainly did not look\nhalf-crazy.\n\nHe pondered the matter. Was that impression being sowed about the\nplanet deliberately? Was someone trying to tear down any reputation or\ninfluence the young man might have?\n\n\"This,\" his eyes gleamed, \"is going to be good. I'm sure going to watch\nand listen carefully today.\"\n\nHanlon crowded into the brains of the two cavals all of his mind they\ncould hold, finding that the animals had enough capacity to take a full\nhalf of his own mind. He had barely enough left in his body to keep on\nwith his work which, luckily, did not require much mental effort. He\nstill had more left than the other stablemen possessed.\n\nThe riders had barely left the palace grounds when Hanlon, through the\ncaval's ears, heard the young man speak.\n\n\"I hope, father, that you have thought about the subject I broached\nto you the other day, and the reasons I suggested for your further\nstudy. I pray you have decided that our world will do well to join the\nFederation of Planets, as we have been invited to do.\"\n\nHanlon could tell, by the tone, that the Ruler's mind and voice were\ntroubled. \"Son, I don't know what to decide. There are so many things\nto think about. There are many good reasons why we should, it is true.\nThere are also many equally good reasons why we should not. I am, as\nyou know, very jealous of Estrella's independence. I should hate to see\nit made subservient to any other power.\"\n\n\"But, father,\" Inver said earnestly, \"we would not be. I have studied\nvery carefully the proposition made us by the Federation Council, and\nthe copy of their constitution they sent with it. They guarantee each\nplanet complete autonomy, and state very plainly that the Council is\nonly a judicial body set up to negotiate intra-planetary treaties and\nto see that the various worlds remain in harmony with each other. The\nadvantages....\"\n\n\"But it's all a trick of those Terrans to get control of the entire\ngalaxy,\" his father broke in.\n\n\"That's not only nonsense, father, but a deliberate lie. I'm sure you\nknow who is fostering it, and I think you can guess the reason.\"\n\n\"I presume you're still talking about the Second-In-Line. But Irad\nisn't like that, at all. He has a good mind, and he has presented\nsome excellent reasons and arguments as to why we should not join the\nFederation.\"\n\n\"Sure, he would. He wants to keep Estrella free, so that when he takes\nover he can pluck it like a....\"\n\n\"That's a strong indictment, son. I hope it is not jealousy because he\nwon out over you in the tests.\"\n\n\"It is not jealousy, and while I haven't the proof yet, k'nyer, I do\nknow it's true,\" the young man said hotly. \"You can be sure that when\nI do get the truth I shall call for Irad's impeachment. No, father, I\nand many friends are concerned over this matter, and are satisfied we\nare correct.\"\n\nHanlon could guess at the troubled eyes of the older man, and that\nhe was shaking his head sadly. \"I hate to think that of Adwal Irad,\"\nhe said. \"He has always seemed so interested in helping me to build\nup Estrella's economy and is constantly bringing new ideas for her\nbetterment. He seems to be making every effort to become worthy of his\npost when he succeeds me.\"\n\n\"I know,\" sadly. \"He wasn't like this until recently. But he has\nchanged someway, father. Now he is power mad. Also, he is trying to\nmake me out as a fool and a brainless dara,\" Inver snapped.\n\n\"Why ... why ... I never heard him say anything like that,\" there was\nastonishment in the elder's voice. \"He always speaks well of you.\"\n\n\"Naturally, k'nyer, he wouldn't be crass enough to say anything of that\nsort to you. But he and his henchmen are spreading that story all over\nour world.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm sure you must be mistaken.\"\n\n\"I'm not,\" grimly. \"The evidence on that is unmistakable.\"\n\nThere was decisiveness now in the Ruler's voice. \"If that's true, I'll\ncertainly put a stop to it.\"\n\n\"Don't, father, not at once,\" his son pleaded quickly. \"Do not even\nmention it to Adwal yet, please. Nor make a public pronouncement about\nit. That would put him on his guard, and I and my friends need time to\nprove the other things I'm talking about.\"\n\n\"I'll not have word spread that my son is a ... a weakling, or stupid,\"\nthe elder's voice was angry, and Hanlon felt the jerk on the reins of\nhis caval that told of the sudden gesture.\n\n\"Just so you don't believe it, father, is all I care at the moment.\"\n\nHanlon felt the two animals swerve and touch sides, and knew that Amir\nhad drawn closer to his son, and shrewdly guessed he was touching the\nboy lovingly.\n\n\"You need never fear that, Inver. I've always been proud of the way\nyou've taken hold of things, ever since you were a boy.\"\n\n\"I've tried, k'nyer, to make myself a worthy son of a great father,\"\nthere was emotion in the young man's voice. \"I've studied everything\nI thought would help me--economics, psychology, statecraft, history,\nand all. And especially, since the Federation first made contact with\nus, I've tried to learn all I could about them, their various forms of\ngovernment, their history, and everything. That's why I'm so sure they\nmean us well, not harm.\"\n\n\"But we're not Terrans. We're just semi-civilized beasts in their eyes.\"\n\n\"Another of Adwal's dirty lies,\" Inver snapped. \"If they felt that,\nwould they have asked us to join them as a full-fledged world? No, they\nwould have come here with a fleet of warships of space, and conquered\nus. They could have, easily, you know. They made no effort to hide the\nfact that they had such power from the ones who were taken on that\ninspection trip.\"\n\n\"No, we have no spaceships, and nothing that could stop one,\" his\nfather admitted. \"That's one of the things that has made me hesitate to\ndecide against them--the fact that they have them but did not use them.\nOn the other hand, if we decide not to join, how do we know they won't\nsend their fleet here and....\"\n\n\"Because they aren't that kind of people. Why, sire, in their history\nI learned that when the Terrans first started exploring space, one of\ntheir great men, named John Snyder, who seems to have had quite a lot\nof power at the time, promulgated a ruling that says, 'Man must never\ncolonize any planet having inhabitants intelligent enough to show\ncultural activity and growth'. And that concept has never been broken,\nand is still in force.\"\n\n\"Why, I never heard that.\"\n\n\"I told you, k'nyer, I have been studying them diligently, and so know\nmuch about them.\"\n\nFor the balance of their ride that morning, the two continued\ntheir discussion, and Hanlon--working through the ears of the two\ncavals--listened closely, and learned much.\n\nThe two were almost back to the residence when Inver's caval stepped\ninto a hole, and stumbled badly. It wrenched its leg so it could barely\nstand on it. Inver immediately dismounted and examined the leg as best\nhe could.\n\n\"It looks bad, father,\" he said after a minute or so. \"I'll walk the\nrest of the way, and lead it slowly. It's not too far from here, so you\ngo ahead if you wish.\"\n\n\"Well,\" slowly, \"all right. I'll have the doctor meet you at the\nstables, and see if the beast can be healed. If not, it should be\ndestroyed to save it pain.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know that would be best, although I dislike to think of it, for\nthis is my favorite.\"\n\nThe Ruler cantered on, and the young man followed slowly, letting the\ncaval hobble along at its own gait. When Inver finally reached the\nstables, he talked with the head groom, Endar, and with the animal\nphysician, who arrived shortly afterwards.\n\n\"I'm not sure,\" was the doctor's statement after much studying. \"I'll\ntry to save it, but I don't know if such an injury will heal or not.\nThe ligament seems to have been torn loose, and being inside the leg\nit is hard to get at it with medicine. See how badly it has swollen\nalready.\"\n\nThe caval was put into its stall, and after treating it as best he\ncould with the limited knowledge and techniques known, the doctor left.\n\nHanlon knew about the accident, of course, and had been keeping the\ncaval from feeling too much of the pain. He made it a point to be\nstanding near while the animal was being examined and treated, and\nwas surprised at how little the doctor could do. The Estrellan\nveterinarian did not even apply hot or cold compresses, nor bandage\nthe swollen leg in any way. Also, apparently, he did not know about\nhypodermics for injecting medicine into the injured parts.\n\nLater in the afternoon, after their work was done and he had some free\ntime, Hanlon thought more concisely about the matter. If he could help\nany, he would make a friend of Inver, he felt sure. More than ever he\nliked the young fellow, whom he decided was a real man in every respect.\n\nBut he must be careful not to give himself away--not to display\nknowledge Estrellans did not know.\n\nSuddenly he recalled the shooting of the fish, and what he had been\nable to do there. \"I wonder if I can help this healing in any way, with\nmy mind?\" he pondered.\n\nThe other grooms, including Endar, had left the stables for the\nbunkhouse, so Hanlon was there alone. He sat down near the injured\ncaval's stall, insinuated his mind into that of the animal, and began\nstudying its brain, nerves and muscles. After considerable intensive\nstudy he found the way to make its muscles relax--he had already long\nsince established a nerve block so that the caval felt no pain. Now he\nlearned to make those muscles and nerves contract or relax, even to the\npoint of almost causing a temporary paralysis.\n\nDeeper and ever deeper he probed into its physical structure.\nEspecially now, he tried to trace the nervous system connecting with\nits various glands, looking for confirmation or refutation of a\nstartling concept he had glimpsed.\n\nAfter much study and experimentation by the trial and error method, he\nwas beginning to find it possible to partially control the increase\nor decrease of flow of the secretions of its glands--but far from\nperfectly. For it was an intricate and involved method, necessitating\nas it did the locating of the nerves that led to and controlled those\nglands, and then learning how to activate or inhibit them--nor could he\nbe sure it was not chance only the few times he made them operate as\nhe wished.\n\nYet he watched carefully to see the results of the activations of each\ngland, and finally believed he had found the one that was the master\ngland in charge of the body's healing functions. He now worked on this,\ntrying to direct the added secretions through the blood stream and into\nthe caval's injured parts.\n\nSoon, even though his forcings were spasmodic and infrequent, he could\nbegin to perceive that this was actually the way it should be done--the\nwounded ligaments and flesh and muscles showed signs of starting to\nheal a bit faster than nature was doing it.\n\nHis deep concentration was rudely broken by a heavy hand on his\nshoulder, and an angry voice saying, \"What d'you think you're doing\nhere?\"\n\nLooking up, he saw that it was Endar. Hanlon recalled the portion of\nhis mind from that of the caval.\n\n\"Oh,\" he scrambled to his feet and fixed his face in a look of deep\nconcern. \"I was just studying Inver's poor caval, and trying to figure\nout a way to help cure its leg.\"\n\nThe head groom sneered. \"I suppose you think you know more about it\nthan I do, or the doctor.\"\n\nHanlon was certain he knew far more than the groom, and probably things\nthe doctor had never even guessed. But he kept his voice humble and\nalmost servile. \"I didn't say or mean that, nyer. But I have had some\nexperience with animals, as I told you and the Ruler, and I've helped\ncure many injured ones. Since it was my off time, I didn't think I was\noverstepping my place to see what I could do.\"\n\n\"You been handling it?\" Endar asked sharply.\n\n\"Oh, no, nyer, I was just sitting here thinking about it, and trying to\nremember all I had learned or heard about how such injuries have been\nhealed. Then I was going to come and suggest them to you.\"\n\n\"Well, it's none of your business, so get out and leave it alone,\" was\nthe surly command ... and Hanlon left.\n\nBut that night, after he was sure the others were all sound asleep, he\nsent his mind back to the stables and into the brain of Inver's injured\nmount.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_In its spaceship the strange being was feeling a depth of frustration\nalmost unknown to one of its cold, logical race. Its \"interrogation\" of\nthe prisoners had yielded surprising but already-deduced information.\nIn its rational yet impersonal way the being was somewhat regretful\nfor the death of the one entity. Not because of the death itself, but\nbecause there was no logical reason why the entity should be dead, and\ntherefore unable to yield further data._\n\n_The one still remaining imprisoned had given up much additional\nknowledge of a kind that had shocked the being, for it told of\nconditions never before considered as obtaining in the galaxy. Yet\nthe being did not see how that information could help in this present\nproject--it was, in fact, decidedly inimical to that project's success._\n\n_As for the one that had been allowed to \"escape,\" that one had led\nto the unreadable mind as hoped. Although still kept controlled and\nUNsane, the being was allowing that one to remain in what it considered\na safe hiding place, rather than continually on the run._\n\n_But even though the being had now been following that enigmatic\nentity's body, through its powerful, multiphased scanners, it still\ncould not make any sort of contact with that mind. Thus it did not yet\nknow whether or not that mind was like the other three, or the two\nthat came occasionally and briefly in their ship of space. Under its\neasily-penetrated disguise, the entity appeared to be like the others,\nbut that could or could not mean anything worth knowing._\n\n_It was all very puzzling, and the alien being came as near feeling\nanger as was possible to one of its phlegmatic nature. But it coldly\nresolved that that one must, also, die ... and soon._\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 16\n\n\nDarkness Made No Difference To George Hanlon in dealing with animal\nminds, for it was not with his eyes that he \"saw\" what was inside them.\nIn this particular instance he was grateful for the dark--it made\nconcentration far easier.\n\nHe made himself comfortable on his bed, then fitted his mind to that\nof the wounded animal in the stable. Deeper and ever deeper he probed,\ntracing line and connectors and synapses carefully. A stray thought\nbrought a grin to his face. \"I bet I'm learning things no veterinarian\never learned about animals.\"\n\nThen he sobered quickly. \"Perhaps I should write this up for them--the\nphysiology and endocrinology of it, I mean.\" He filed the thought away\nin his mind for future reference. It would be a great contribution to\nthose branches of science, he felt--IF he was successful.\n\nNow he traced nerves, blood vessels, cells, glands. He bored in\nwith every newly-awakened sense alert to catch each particle of\nnew knowledge. He began to learn even more of how the healing and\nregeneration of cells and tissues worked ... and after awhile he\nachieved real beginnings of success.\n\nThe things he had been able to do that afternoon, with his first\nstudies, had started the healing of the caval's leg somewhat faster\nthan nature ordinarily did it, but not much more. Now, however, he was\nable more surely and quickly to continue that work, and by the time he\nnoticed the false dawn lightening the night a bit, and he knew he must\nget some sleep, the injury was almost entirely healed.\n\n\"What a surprise Endar's going to get when he looks at that leg in the\nmorning,\" he chuckled. For the swelling was reduced, the inflammation\nall gone, and the caval was able to stand and walk on the foot without\nlimping or apparent pain. In fact, from his ability to read the\nbeast's mind, Hanlon knew the pain was all gone. If nothing happened\nto irritate it, the leg would be as good as new in a day or so without\nfurther attention.\n\nHanlon was sleeping so soundly the next morning that Endar had trouble\nwaking him, and that did not help in dispelling the anger and distrust\nin him the head groom knew. Hanlon tried to work hard enough, and was\ncareful to appear willing and ready even for the mean, dirty jobs Endar\nassigned him, so as not to make the groom any more irritated than he\nalready was.\n\nShortly after daylight Inver came to the stables to see how his\nfavorite caval was getting along. He and Endar were very much surprised\nto see that the animal was apparently entirely well, and that the leg\nshowed no signs of the injury of the day before.\n\n\"I can't understand it,\" the young man shook his head. \"It must not\nhave been as badly hurt as we thought.\"\n\nEndar may have had his doubts--and Hanlon saw him throw a quick,\nwondering glance in his direction--but the groom wisely said nothing,\nsince he had no proof ... and such a thought was ridiculous, anyway.\n\nWhen it came time for the Ruler's morning ride, Hanlon was still\nworking inside. But Elus Amir asked to see the new man, and Endar had\nto call him out.\n\n\"Ah, my savior,\" Amir said as Hanlon appeared. \"Are they treating you\nwell, Lona?\"\n\nHanlon bent the knee. \"Oh, yes, k'nyer. I have everything to make me\nhappy here, and I love the work. And Endar has been most kind about\nshowing me around, and helping me learn all my duties here so I may\nserve you better.\"\n\n\"Good. I'd like to have you ride with me this morning,\" the Ruler said\nas he mounted.\n\nHanlon glanced at Endar. He could see that the head groom was not\npleased by this, though he said nothing, merely handing the reins of\nthe second mount to Hanlon, then turning away. Hanlon was quickly\nastride, and the two riders started off at a brisk canter.\n\nAs soon as they were well away from the residence, Amir slowed down\nand motioned Hanlon to come to his side. \"Now, tell me all about the\nEastern Continent--what conditions are like there, and what the people\nare saying about things in general.\"\n\nHanlon dredged his mind for any and all information he could remember\nfrom his studies of the reels of Estrella furnished him by the secret\nservice, as well as what he had learned from others since he came to\nthis planet.\n\nFor nearly a penta-period he told what he knew, then said, \"One thing\nis quite noticeable there, k'nyer. The ordinary people I talked to over\nthere--of course, I don't know any of the important ones--all seem very\nanxious for our world to join the Terran Federation of Planets.\"\n\n\"They are?\" the Ruler seemed surprised, but interested. \"I thought\nthere was quite a bit of sentiment against it.\"\n\nHanlon shrugged as though it was of no importance. \"Oh, you hear a\nlot of talk going around that we would lose our freedom, and that the\npeople of the Federation just want to enslave us, but no one I talked\nto seemed really to believe it. They think someone there is putting\nout a lot of propaganda because of some personal reasons. The ordinary\npeople think they would benefit greatly by such a union with more\nadvanced people. One of our newssheets printed a copy of the Federation\nAgreement, and it states very clearly that all worlds are to have full\nright to choose their own form of government, and that they keep their\nfull ... their full....\"\n\n\"Sovereignty,\" the Ruler supplied the missing word.\n\n\"Thank you, k'nyer ... their full sovereignty at all times. It also\nwent on to say that all the other worlds do just as they please, and\nthat the only purpose of the Federation is to encourage trade and the\nspread of knowledge among the various planets in an equitable way, and\nyet see to it that they never get into war with each other, by settling\nall possible disputes before they get to the explosive point.\"\n\nElus Amir was silent for long minutes, thinking seriously, and Hanlon\nfollowed those thoughts as they chased themselves across the screen\nof the Ruler's mind. Finally Amir raised his head. \"Er ... yes, yes,\nthat's all true enough, Lona. But if it is so, why is there such a\nseemingly-determined effort to persuade me and the people here that it\nis not true?\"\n\n\"May I speak my thoughts, k'nyer?\"\n\n\"Eh? Why, of course,\" Amir looked up in surprise. \"That's why I wanted\nyou to come along today.\"\n\n\"Well, sire, it looks to me--and please remember that I'm just a simple\ncountryman, and not used to politics or statesmanship--but it looks to\nme as though someone wanted to keep us by ourselves so they could run\nthis world the way they want to, and be able to make themselves rich or\npowerful at the expense of our common people.\"\n\n\"But that's impossible as long as our government is on its guard.\"\n\n\"Exactly, k'nyer. It could not be done as long as you are Ruler, but\nsuppose you....\"\n\nElus Amir's head snapped up irritably at this unfinished warning. \"The\nSecond-In-Line is just as jealous of Estrella's welfare as I am,\" he\nsnapped. \"It would not happen under him either.\"\n\nBut Hanlon, reading the Ruler's surface thoughts, knew he must keep\nquiet for the moment. For Amir was disturbed by hearing this idea from\na simple groom. He did not want to give it credence, but doubt had been\nforced into his mind, first by his son, and now by this man.\n\nBut before he could formulate any decisive answer, Hanlon decided\nboldly to jolt him again.\n\n\"I have a friend, k'nyer,\" he reached into his inner pocket and brought\nout some papers, \"who has been actively studying this matter for some\ntime. He has found out a number of things I am sure will interest you,\nand about which I doubt very much you know.\"\n\nThe Ruler looked at him sharply. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"You know that there has been an unprecedented crime wave all over\nour planet recently,\" Hanlon said, and Amir nodded sorrowfully. \"My\nfriend has found proof that, while a lot of people have been engaged in\nthose criminal activities, there is a complete program that is being\ncarefully carried on by a staff of head men, each with his own group of\nlower criminals, but all headed by one....\"\n\n\"By the Terrans--it is well known here.\"\n\n\"No, k'nyer, not by the Terrans. The real leader of this campaign of\ndestruction is the same man who is the leader of the opposition to\nEstrella's joining the Federation.\"\n\n\"And that man?\" the Ruler snapped, but his face was drawn, as though he\nalready knew ... but would not let himself believe.\n\n\"That leader, k'nyer, is Adwal Irad.\"\n\n\"Prove it, or by Zappa I'll have you executed,\" Amir's voice crackled.\n\"Have a care, Lona, and don't try my patience. I don't allow myself to\nbe talked to in that manner.\"\n\n\"I crave pardon, sire, if I have spoken out of line. But you asked me\nfor my reactions and knowledge, and I must be truthful.\"\n\n\"Whatever gave you such foolish notions? And who are you, anyway? A\ncountryman such as you claim to be would not know about such\nthings ... or use such precise language.\"\n\n\"You might be surprised, k'nyer, if you knew how many of your humbler\nsubjects are vastly interested in the welfare of our world, and who\nread and think much about these things, even though they know they\ncannot fully understand them. As to how I got such ideas, the answer\nis, many things. And facts collected by my friend. Including this\nlittle book,\" handing him Esbor's notebook, \"which was found in ...\nwell, in a certain place. It contains a lot of information we were sure\nyou would want to study, which is the reason he asked me to give it to\nyou if I got the chance.\"\n\nThe Ruler took the book, opened and glanced through it. Hanlon could\nsee the start of surprise he made, and read the thoughts that flashed\nthrough the Ruler's mind as he saw some of the notations. During the\nremainder of the ride, now at a slow walk, there was complete silence,\nuntil they were nearing the residence's courtyard. Then Amir looked at\nHanlon, a shrewd look on his face.\n\n\"You're a curious fellow, Lona. Who are you, really?\"\n\n\"One of the many who have the interests of yourself and this world very\nmuch at heart,\" Hanlon said honestly. \"Please do not ask me more, but\nbelieve that we are honest and sincere. Your son has many friends ...\"\nhe stopped, letting it go at that, knowing the Ruler's memory would\nflash back to the talk with Inver the day before, and hoping Amir would\nnot pursue his questioning.\n\nElus Amir began studying Hanlon closely, an examination the young man\nknew might quickly disclose his imposture. He made his caval suddenly\nshy away, and took several moments controlling it enough so he could\nride back to the Ruler's side--but stayed a bit further behind than he\nhad been before.\n\nAs he had hoped, this maneuver had given Amir time to think. \"Very\nwell,\" the Ruler said, \"I'll not inquire too closely at the moment,\nalthough you may be sure,\" more sternly now, \"that I shall be on my\nguard to know if you are really working for me or not.\"\n\nHe was silent a moment, then added slowly, \"But as to what you have\nsaid, and this book ... well, I promise to study them thoroughly.\"\n\nHanlon thanked Elus Amir for his courtesy to a humble groom. \"And thank\nyou for the great privilege of riding with you, and talking to you. I\nhave always felt, k'nyer,\" he made bold to add, \"that we have a truly\ngreat Ruler. Now,\" he smiled sincerely, \"I am more sure of it than\never.\"\n\n\"Why, thank you, Lona. I do try to watch out for the best interests of\nour people.\"\n\n\"A groom should not presume to advise his Ruler, but I feel emboldened\nto say that your people would be glad if you decide to join the Terran\nFederation,\" Hanlon said humbly, then added more earnestly, \"and I beg\nyou, sire, watch out for yourself. There are human tamous abroad.\"\n\nThe Ruler looked startled, but said nothing to this, although he\nbecame very thoughtful as he left. Hanlon, except for one point, was\nwell content with his morning's work, as he led the cavals back to the\nstable.\n\nFor Hanlon had so much wanted to tell Amir how he could know for a\ncertainty who among his attendants and guards was really trustworthy,\nbut did not dare mention it at this time. It would have been fairly\neasy for Hanlon to be inconspicuously present--perhaps hidden by a\nscreen--while the Ruler called his guards and servants in one by one\nand questioned them. For Hanlon could then have read their minds or\nsurface thoughts, and undoubtedly have been able to tell which ones,\nif any, were lying. But to have even mentioned such a thing would have\nbeen to reveal too much that he was not yet ready to have known.\n\n\"I'll have to hang around the guards as much as possible, and study\ntheir minds for any traitorous thoughts,\" he decided. \"Especially, I\nwant to know if any of them are Irad's tools.\"\n\nEndar was surly when Hanlon brought the mounts into the stable,\nalthough he did nothing overt as the young man carefully rubbed down\nthe cavals, and returned them to their stalls.\n\nBut Endar did come up then and ask, \"What did Amir have to talk to you\nabout?\"\n\n\"We did very little talking,\" Hanlon answered with apparent\ntruthfulness. \"He asked me a few questions about Lura and the Eastern\nContinent, but I told him I was just a farm worker and didn't know much\nabout general conditions. That seemed to disappoint him, and he said\nnothing more.\"\n\n\"But I saw him talking to you as he dismounted, and you were answering\nhim.\"\n\n\"Yes, he was kind enough to say he enjoyed the ride, and that the\ncavals were in fine condition. I told him that was largely due to you,\nthat you were careful to see that they were well cared for, and that we\nkept the stables clean.\"\n\n\"That reminds me, how did it happen that Inver's caval was all healed\nthis morning?\" the man's eyes bored suspiciously into Hanlon's.\n\n\"Why, I don't know,\" he answered evasively, his face bland. \"I suppose\nit was the medicine and treatment the doctor gave it. He must really\nbe good--but then, he wouldn't be the Ruler's animal physician if he\nwasn't, would he?\"\n\n\"_Hmmpff_,\" Endar swung away, but his attitude and surface thoughts\ntold Hanlon that he was only partially satisfied. He had no real idea,\nof course, of what had happened. Such a thing was just beyond his\nsimple comprehension.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGeorge Hanlon could not know it, of course, but as soon as the Ruler\nhad returned to his rooms, he settled himself comfortably in his\nfavorite chair, and gave orders that he was not to be disturbed. Then\nhe set his mind to considering every aspect of this curious business,\nand to studying more thoroughly the papers and that notebook of\nEsbor's, with its disquieting notations.\n\nFinally he called in the man who was not only a sort of confidential\nsecretary, but a life-long friend and confidant whom he trusted\nimplicitly. He gave this man definite orders as to certain\ninvestigations to be made at once.\n\nDuring the balance of the day, while this man was gone, Amir's mind was\na turmoil of doubt. And worry--for Hanlon's final suggestion that the\nRuler's life was in great danger, made him pause to think. Of course,\nRulers were always fair targets for assassins, even on this world where\nsuch things were very rare, indeed. But ... Lona had hinted that this\nwas no ordinary assassination he was to watch out for, but a part of\nthe so-called \"plot\" of a group who were out to keep Estrella from\njoining the Terran-led Federation.\n\nAnd if the groom was right, then how safe was Amir? Even in his own\nresidence ... was his personal guard loyal? Or had the conspirators ...\nsupposing there was such a group...?\n\nThe Ruler was still reluctant to believe Irad was at the head of any\nsuch organization, or even connected with it in any way, despite\nthe mounting evidence ... including more than one entry in Esbor's\nrevealing notebook. Had these conspirators, whoever they might be, been\nable to infiltrate members into his hitherto highly-trusted household?\nWait, come to think of it, there were several new servants and guards,\ncome to work there within the past half year or so!\n\nElus Amir had never heard of truth serums, or lie-detectors, for such\nthings had not yet been discovered or invented on Estrella. Nor did he\neven suspect that it was possible to read a man's mind.\n\nNow the Ruler's thoughts strayed back to that enigmatic groom. Just\nwho and what was he, anyway? He certainly was not a common, simple\ncountryman, as he pretended to be. And the way he had met the Ruler,\nsaved his life and obtained work here. Looking back now Amir could see\nthat it was all too pat.\n\nWas he one of those \"friends\" Inver had spoken about, who were working\nwith his son to find out the truth about whatever it was that was\ngoing on here? It was apparent he was part of a group of some kind, or\nelse his talk of a \"friend\" who had obtained that damning notebook was\nfalse, and Lona himself had managed to get possession of it.\n\nActing on a sudden impulse, Amir sent a servant to ask Inver to come to\nsee him. When the young man arrived, the Ruler looked at him a moment.\n\n\"Just one question, my son. Are some of those 'friends' you spoke to me\nabout yesterday numbered among the residence servants or guards?\"\n\nInver looked startled, but his reply was patently honest. \"Yes, father.\nWe have been checking the others carefully, and when we find those we\ndistrust in the least, we manage to get them discharged, and others we\ncan trust brought in to replace them. Why?\"\n\nBut the Ruler did not answer that last. He merely said, \"Thank you,\nInver. That is all for the present.\"\n\nNow the young man really was astonished at this abrupt dismissal, but\nleft without further words.\n\nElus Amir felt better now. He had always considered himself a fairly\ngood judge of character--although he was beginning to wonder now if all\nthat was being told him about Irad was true, for if so, then he had\nmade a bad mistake in judging the Second-In-Line, for he had always had\nfull confidence in his integrity.\n\nBut about this Lona? He sent a servant to bring Endar, the head groom,\nto see him. When the man arrived, Amir asked him many questions as to\nwhat Endar thought of the new man. He realized almost from the first\nthat Endar was jealous of Lona's popularity with the Ruler, but Endar\nproduced no actual facts against the new stableman, and grudgingly had\nto admit that he was a good and willing worker.\n\nYes, Amir now decided, whatever else this Lona might be, he was a true\npatriot, trying to serve the best interests of his country and his\nRuler in every way he could. There was a straight-forwardness about him\nthat Amir liked, and evidently Inver also had confidence in him.\n\nYet there was a tantalizing _something_ about Lona's looks that had\nthe Ruler a bit puzzled, although it was more subconsciously than\nconsciously.\n\nFor the time being, he decided, he would allow Lona to remain here. It\nwould be easier to keep watch on him here than if he let him go and the\ngroom should disappear entirely. Also, Amir determined to have further\ntalks with this strange man ... and with Inver, about the latter's\n\"group of friends.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFinally, some time after dinner that evening, the Ruler's secretary\ncame back to report. \"I have examined the news records, k'nyer, and\nthe first mention I can find of anything like propaganda against our\nworld's accepting the invitation of the Federation Council was printed\nin the Stearran papers about a week after the group returned from that\ntrip made to visit the Terran planets.\"\n\n\"Hmmm, not until then, eh ... but that seems to tally with some other\nthings I've heard. Still, it is curious. Another point is still\nbothering me, and I'd like your thoughts on it. The Terrans evidently\ndiscovered us long before we knew it, and studied us even to the extent\nof learning our language, while still keeping us in ignorance of their\nexistence. It was this apparent stealth that has led many of us to\nwonder if they are sincere, or if there is some underlying motive of\nconquest behind them. What do you think?\"\n\n\"As you know, k'nyer,\" the secretary reached up to tug at his beard\nwhile thinking and replying, \"I was permitted to be present at the\nmeetings you had with the Federation representatives, and I was very\nmuch impressed with them. I have also talked much with those who went\non the trip to the Terran planets. I cannot conceive the possibility\nthat these Federationists are practicing duplicity. Besides, let us\nconsider our own actions in such a case. Suppose we had space travel,\nand found a new world inhabited with intelligent beings. Would we not,\nif possible, study them thoroughly before trying to make contact with\nthem?\"\n\nElus Amir shrugged, and his answer was to the first part of his\nfriend's speech. \"That might depend upon how well they were able to\nconceal their true feelings--upon how good actors they were.\"\n\n\"Perhaps, but....\"\n\n\"Never mind that for now. What about the rumors concerning my son,\nInver?\"\n\n\"Those were much harder to check, but in my own mind there is no\nrecollection of ever having heard of any such thing until the past\nyear. However, I have heard reports of it since, and it seems to be\nspreading rapidly all over.\"\n\n\"And you never reported this to me?\"\n\nThe secretary hung his head. \"I did not believe it, sire, and I didn't\nlike to worry....\"\n\n\"It's all right. So it was just about a year ago that the opposition to\nour joining the Federation appeared, and also these rumors.\"\n\n\"Why ... why, yes, sire. Do you connect the two?\"\n\nAmir did not answer that last question. He sat very quietly as to body,\nbut with mind active and ill at ease. After a bit he raised his eyes\nand asked suddenly, \"Just what is your personal opinion of Adwal Irad.\nSpeak freely--I want the truth.\"\n\nThe secretary's eyes clouded, but he did not hesitate. \"I have noticed\na great change in the Second-In-Line, growing more pronounced recently.\nAs though something were preying on his mind. His actions have\nbecome ... well, 'shifty' is the nearest word I can think of to\ndescribe it. I no longer trust him unreservedly, I am sorry to say.\"\n\n\"Hmmm,\" Amir thought about that for some time. \"I have had the same\nthing told me by others these past few days,\" he said at last. \"I wish\nI knew....\"\n\n\"May I suggest, k'nyer, that you invite him to ride with you tomorrow,\nand study him; ask him leading questions, and so on?\"\n\n\"That might not be a bad idea. I'll do it. Send him an invitation in my\nname, please.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_After the note had been received, and while Irad was changing his\nplans so as to accept this command, he suddenly seemed to get a feeling\nthat he must do a certain thing. The Second-In-Line recoiled in horror.\nHe did not want to comply--did not even want to think such a thought.\nThis was far worse than the other things he had been forced to do in\nthe past months. But something ... he could not imagine what, nor\nwhy ... was forcing him to do this, as it had the others._\n\n_Reluctantly, fighting with all his will not to do what he somehow had\nto do, he sent word to several of his men and, when they arrived at\nhis home, gave them explicit instructions. They seemed surprised, and\nreluctant, but he insisted and, somewhat to their surprise, the plan\nsoon seemed like a good one._\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 17\n\n\nThe next morning Hanlon was told to take two cavals out to the mounting\nblock, for Adwal Irad was to ride with the Ruler that day. As the two\nmen came out of the residence and Hanlon got his first good look at\nthe Second-In-Line for some time, he was thunderstruck at the man's\nappearance--it was so changed from when he had seen him the other times.\n\nIrad's face was drawn and the red of his skin was an unhealthy hue.\nDeep lines were beginning to show in his face, the eyes were so dim and\nlack-lustre, the mouth so drawn, that Hanlon wondered if Irad was ill,\nor had been these past few days.\n\nFor the one who had passed highest in all his tests from among those\neligible in his generation as to knowledge and fitness for the position\nof Second-In-Line, and successor to the Rulership, such a breakdown\nseemed incredible.\n\nHanlon invaded Irad's mind to see if he could learn why all this was.\nBut at first touch there seemed something wrong with it ... as though\nthere was a block or barrier there in that mind unlike any he had ever\nbefore found. It seemed even worse than it had been before when he had\ntested that mind--and he wondered anew what it could possibly be. He\ncould still read Irad's surface thoughts, but the \"feel\" of the man's\nmind was different and disturbing.\n\nHanlon's mind-scanning, however, was just in time to catch the partial\nthought, \"... this the fellow? He'll bear watching.\"\n\nIt was not much to go on, but Hanlon instantly became more alert. \"What\nin Snyder's name does that mean?\" he asked himself. \"Wish I had some\nway of watching this bozo when he isn't around me.\"\n\nBut he did not know of any way it could be done, for he could not very\nwell leave the palace grounds while he was working here as a groom, to\nspy in person upon Irad's coming and goings, and he knew of no animal\nor bird kept in the home of the Second-In-Line.\n\n\"Wonder what became of Ebony?\" Hanlon thought parenthetically. \"Hope he\nfound a way to get out of Yandor's house, and that he has a new, good\nhome.\"\n\nAnd this brought up the sternly-repressed memory of his father. Oh,\nhow he wanted to drop everything and go hunt for his dad. But he had\nalready thought the matter through, and knew his duty kept him at his\nwork--work that was far more important than one man's liberty. Yes, his\nmind knew that, but his heart did not.\n\nBut Hanlon could and did keep in touch with the two men through the\nminds of their cavals as they rode that morning, even as he returned to\nhis work in the stables.\n\nAnd it was well he did so. For hardly were they outside the gates when\nIrad began again to argue against Estrella's joining the Federation.\nBut today his so-called evidence met stiffer opposition than formerly.\nFor the Ruler had been thinking more seriously than before, and was\nstudying what Irad said with that in mind.\n\nThe things Hanlon--as Lona, the groom--had said had been disturbing. At\nfirst Amir had been tempted to dismiss them as ridiculous, even though\nthey more or less echoed what his own son, Inver, had told him. But\nthat damning notebook and its entries was something the Ruler could\nnot dismiss, nor the reports and comments of his life-long friend and\nrespected secretary. He was still undecided--but he was no longer to\nbe duped by sincere-seeming words.\n\nNow, as the two men rode along, Amir was remembering those things and\njudging each statement Irad made with what he had heard.\n\nAnd SSM George Hanlon, \"listening in\" via the minds and senses of the\ntwo cavals he was controlling, shivered a bit in the distant stables.\nHe felt a premonition ... but could not deduce what, nor how, nor even\nif. But he determined to keep closer watch than ever, and so tightened\nhis control of the two steeds cantering along that dusty road several\nmiles away.\n\nAs he had found he was able to do, the portions of his mind in each of\nthe animals was, in a large sense, complete and able to act of and by\nitself. Yet both portions were connected with each other, and with the\nbalance of his mind in his own brain, by a thin thread of consciousness.\n\nHe had never quite gotten used to the sensation of apparently being\nin several places at the same time--of being several distinct\nindividualities. He still remembered the thrill he had known when it\nwas first demonstrated, and the times it had saved him. Yet it was a\nweird feeling, even though he had found how wonderfully it could and\ndid help him in the important work assigned him by the secret service\nhigh command.\n\nOnly a few minutes later, however, he was glad he had the power. The\nRuler and Irad were passing a small wood, when suddenly several other\ncavalmen came racing from it, and surrounded them. Two of the new\nmen--all of whom were masked--caught the bridles of the two animals\nfrom the residence, and halted them abruptly.\n\n\"What is the meaning of this?\" Elus Amir cried imperiously, apparently\nmore angry than frightened.\n\nBut Hanlon, so far distant he could not possibly get to the place\npersonally, in time to be of any help, was worried and scared. This\nattack had all the earmarks of assassination and, knowing what he knew,\nhe was sure it was intended as such.\n\nHe must do something, but quick.\n\nDropping his pitchfork, he raced into the tackroom where he knew\nthere was a cot. Throwing his body down on this, he sent all the\nremainder of his mind out to contact and control the cavals of the\nnewcomers--working outward from the two he was already controlling that\nwere at the scene.\n\nHe did not have mind enough to fully take over all of them at once, for\ncavals had potentially much mind-power, and four or five could absorb\nall his.\n\nHowever, by temporarily dropping control of Amir's animal, he was able\nto take over enough regulation to overcome the commands of the riders.\nHe made the horses of four of the assassins, those holding flameguns,\nrear back and begin fighting their riders. They pitched and bucked and\nshortly started dashing off on a wild runaway gallop across the meadow,\nin different directions. He impressed on each caval's mind as well as\nhe could that it must keep on running, no matter what was done to stop\nit.\n\nThen he wrenched control from their minds and sent it into the other\nfour animals. He found he was just in time. One of the men, who had\nbeen holding Amir's caval--Hanlon could see through its eyes--was\ndrawing his flamegun.\n\nHanlon made this caval rear suddenly, pitching the man off onto the\nroad. The animal swivelled about while in the air and landed its heavy\nfeet on the prone body. It kicked and pawed the helpless gangster until\nthere was nothing left but a battered and bloody mass.\n\nThe remaining attacker's caval was, meanwhile, racing off across the\nmeadow in much the same runaway fashion as the ones that had preceded\nit. When it was well away, Hanlon withdrew control.\n\nMeanwhile, he had been watching carefully through the eyes and ears of\nthe two steeds that bore the Ruler and the Second-In-Line, what they\nwere doing and saying.\n\nThrough Irad's mount he could see the look of surprise and fright that\nhad come upon the Ruler's face. Fright, Hanlon rightly guessed, at\nAmir's near approach to death, surprise that the attack had been made\nat all, and especially at the unbelievable manner of his deliverance.\n\n\"What could possibly have made all those cavals start running away just\nat the crucial moment?\" he asked Irad, whom he did not yet suspect.\n\"And even more amazing, the way that one threw and then so savagely\nkilled its rider, yet is now standing quietly there, munching grass at\nthe roadside?\"\n\nBut both Amir, and Hanlon--who saw it through the Ruler's caval's\neyes--saw the look of hatred and rage that came onto the face of\nthe Second-In-Line, giving it almost the appearance of a completely\ndifferent person. Amir was so shocked by it that for a moment he could\nnot speak--could only stare in open-mouthed amazement. Hanlon too was\nstartled, momentarily failing to watch the actions of Irad.\n\nAnd in that instant the conspirator tried to act. From a hidden pocket\nin his clothing he drew a flamer, and aimed it at the Ruler.\n\n\"Maybe this will spoil my plans,\" he snarled, \"but by Zappa, you die\nanyway.\"\n\nBut even as he was speaking, and while he was pressing the stud in the\ngun's handle, Hanlon snapped himself into awareness, and made Irad's\nmount rear back and wheel on its hind legs, while at the same time he\nforced the Ruler's caval to dodge to one side.\n\nBut he was not quick enough. There was a flash of flame, a stench of\nburning cloth and flesh, and a hastily-suppressed groan, all clearly\napparent through the cavals' senses, that told the distant Hanlon that\nAmir had been hit. He felt the Ruler reel in his saddle, and hoped the\nblast was not fatal.\n\nBut he had no time then save for an incidental inspection, despite the\nabilities of his divided mind. For he was intent on trying to make\nIrad's caval unseat its rider, so that he might have the beast trample\nthe conspirator. Even so he could feel Amir--through the senses of the\nsteed the Ruler was riding--clutch the pommel with both hands to hold\nhimself on his mount's back.\n\nBut Adwal Irad was an excellent cavalman. He managed to keep his seat,\nbut was too busy with this either to look to see if his shot had killed\nhis Ruler, or to fire another. In a moment he had to drop the gun,\nanyway, in order to use both hands in trying to quiet the raging animal\nbeneath him.\n\nFor the caval was rearing, bucking, sun-fishing--every unusual maneuver\nHanlon's agile mind was able to make it perform. It did things no\ncaval, and no Estrellan, had ever heard of before. Through its mind\nHanlon could feel the cruel whipping Irad was giving it, and this made\nboth Hanlon and the beast--never more than half-tame at best--viciously\nangry and more determined than ever to get rid of the burden.\n\nRealizing at last that he could not unseat so skillful a rider, Hanlon\nchanged his tactics. He made the caval start off on a dead run--but\ninto the woods, not across the meadow as the others had done. \"Maybe it\nwill run under a low branch and knock Irad off his back,\" he hoped.\n\nBut he was worried about Amir, and turned most of his mind back to\nseeing how the Ruler was faring. He knew the man was still astride, and\nwith part of his mind he could read pain, but knew Amir was not fatally\ninjured. Hanlon made his mount turn back toward the residence, and at\nits gentlest speed hasten back until he saw the servants come running\nout to take care of their master.\n\nKnowing the Ruler was now in safe hands, Hanlon was free to think of\nhis own situation.\n\nHe opened his eyes ... and stared with growing astonishment at totally\nunfamiliar surroundings.\n\nJerkily he sat up on the bunk on which his body was now lying. His eyes\nroved about the small, stone-walled room, trying to figure out where he\nwas ... and why.\n\nHe had gone into the familiar tackroom of the stables, he knew, to lie\ndown on the cot there while he sent all of his mind out of his body to\ncontact and control the cavals of the would-be assassins. He guessed\nhe had been \"gone\" for about half an hour. What had happened in the\nmeantime?\n\nHe got up and went across the small room to a heavy wooden door, which\nhe found to be locked. He had to stand on tiptoes to look through the\nsmall, barred window in it. But his only view was of a narrow corridor,\non the other side of which was another' stone wall containing, in the\nlimited portions he could see to either side, three doors similar to\nthe one behind which he was confined.\n\n\"Looks like I'm in the _juzgado_,\" he grimaced. \"Wonder why, and how?\"\n\nHe called out, in hopes someone would come and explain. But repeated\ncalls brought no one, nor any response from the other cells. \"Must be\nno one else here,\" he thought, and went back to lie down on the bunk.\n\nThere he used his special talents, sending his mind outside and hunting\nfor some bird or animal through whose eyes he could try to discover\nwhere he was.\n\nHe finally contacted a bird, and soon discovered he was in a small\nstone building at one of the farther corners of the residential\ngrounds. There did not seem to be any guards hanging about the outside.\nHanlon made the bird fly up and hover near one of the windows, and peer\ninside. No one there, either, nor any to be seen through either of the\nother windows that opened to the outer wall.\n\nHe sent the bird higher until he could see the entire palace grounds\nand thus orient himself. Then he flew it to the stables.\n\nEndar was talking to two other grooms, and seemed in high spirits. As\nthe bird found a perch close to the little group he heard Endar saying,\n\"... drunk, so I had the guards arrest him.\"\n\n\"Never knew he drank,\" one of the stablemen said.\n\n\"I was surprised, myself, but he was dead to the world, and I couldn't\nrouse him.\"\n\nBut Hanlon could detect, in the man's voice and attitude, that Endar\nfelt he had achieved his revenge for all the fancied wrongs Hanlon (as\nLona) had done or contemplated doing to him.\n\nSatisfied for the time being, although not too happy at the situation\nin which he found himself, Hanlon withdrew his mind from the bird, and\ntwisted his body into a more comfortable position on the bunk. There\nwas so much he had to think about, and now that he was undisturbed was\na splendid time.\n\nHe felt confident that the Ruler, Elus Amir, knew the truth about Adwal\nIrad and the conspiracy, and would no longer hesitate about joining the\nFederation.\n\n\"He might, though, at that,\" Hanlon thought seriously. \"Especially\nif he happens to get it into his noggin that we Terrans were back of\nall that has happened. It's a dirty shame he doesn't understand us\nbetter--or that we don't know their ways of thinking better. But then,\nthat's the cause of half the troubles between individuals, nations,\nraces and worlds--they simply don't understand the basic motivations\nof the other fellow. But about Amir--I wonder if now isn't the time\nto prod him a bit? If--or as soon as--I get out of here, I'll try\nsomeway to get in touch with the Federation, and suggest we have the\nambassadors come back and talk to him again. He ought to be ripe now.\"\n\nIt was only after some time that he remembered to wonder if Irad had\nbeen hurt or killed by his runaway caval. \"I should have stayed in its\nmind until I knew if he got home or what.\"\n\nHanlon again sought out a bird, and when he was in control of its\nmind, sent it winging across the roofs and the country-side to the home\nof the Second-In-Line. When it got there, nothing could be seen to\nindicate that anyone was at home, nor was anyone visible when the bird\npeered through each of the windows.\n\nHanlon perched the bird on a tree-limb while he thought seriously for\nsome moments. Then he sent the bird on the Ovil Esbor's house. \"Maybe I\ncan pick up a clue there.\"\n\nBut, as soon as the bird started looking through windows, Hanlon knew\nhe had uncovered more than a clue. For Irad was there, talking to three\nor four men.\n\nHanlon wanted very much to hear their conversation. But how? The bird\nhunted in vain, but could find no open door or window by which it could\nenter. Nor were there open chimneys as are so common on Terran worlds,\nfor the Estrellans covered their smoke-and-fume vents with fine screens.\n\nHanlon made the bird perch on a tree-limb and go to sleep. Then he\nsent that portion of his mind from its brain, seeking some small\nanimal, rodent or insect inside the house. He finally found one of\ntheir rat-things in its hole beneath the foundation. He took over its\nmind, wincing as he did so at the vicious, stark ferocity there. But he\nmade it scamper through the walls until it came to the room where the\nconspirators were talking. The rat had already gnawed an entrance hole\nthrough the bottom of the wall there, and Hanlon had it crouch just\ninside, listening.\n\nIt took him only a few seconds to realize that the angry Irad must have\ntold the others about their strange fiasco that morning, and that they\nwere planning how they could finish the thing they had started.\n\n\"I don't dare go back to the palace, myself, for some time, at least,\"\nIrad scowled blackly. \"I lost my head and gave the whole thing away\nback there, I know. Came right out and told Amir I was going to kill\nhim. Who'd have guessed those fool cavals would act the way they did?\"\n\n\"There's something mighty funny about that, Adwal,\" one of the men\nsaid in a puzzled tone that almost contained a hint of accusation.\n\"One caval could quite easily have become frightened at something, or\ntaken it into its silly head to bolt. You never can tame or train 'em\ncompletely. But you said all of your group did the same thing. That\njust doesn't sound right to me. What made them do it, just at the wrong\ntime, and spoil your plans?\"\n\nHanlon could hear the Second-In-Line laugh sneeringly. \"You suggesting\nmagic of some sort, Ovil?\"\n\n\"I'm not suggesting anything--I'm just asking,\" and now the man's voice\ncarried even more of suspicion and accusation. \"It all sounds mighty\nstrange and unbelievable to me. We'd like to know more about it.\"\n\nThere was a dangerous sharpness in Adwal Irad's voice. \"Are you\nquestioning the truth of my report, Esbor?\"\n\n\"I'm not doubting you ... yet. But there's something going on here\nthat looks peculiar, to say the least, and we want to know all about\nit. That assassination was planned so carefully. And all the men with\nyou were good riders. It just doesn't seem possible that all of them\nshould have lost control of their cavals at exactly the same time. And\nthat business about the animal Yllo was riding--throwing him and then\nkilling him, as you reported.\"\n\nHanlon, through the rat's ears, could hear the other men muttering\nagreement to this.\n\nIrad sprang to his feet, his voice shrill. \"You calling me a liar,\nEsbor?\"\n\n\"Not exactly, but I do think we deserve a better explanation of your\nfailure than that silly story. We're all in this, too, and our lives\nare more at stake than yours, since you're Second....\"\n\n\"You won't have to worry about your life any more,\" Irad screamed, and\nalmost too swiftly to follow he yanked out his flamegun and cindered\nthe politician's body before any of the others could object or stop\nhim. As the man's body--what was left of it--fell to the floor, Irad\nswung his gun about menacingly, covering the others, who had risen in\nfright.\n\n\"Any of the rest of you phidis want to call me a liar?\" he rasped.\n\n\"No, of course not, Adwal,\" one of them spoke in a placating manner.\n\"We've never doubted you.\"\n\n\"Anybody with any sense could figure out that you really tried to kill\nAmir,\" another said. \"Why, look. You're the one who started all this,\nand you sure wouldn't have worked so hard, or spent so much on this\ncampaign, if you hadn't intended going through with it.\"\n\n\"That's right. What happened was just some tough luck. And Esbor was\ngetting ideas that were bigger than he was. So let's forget what's\npassed, and settle down to planning something else, and making sure\nit's fool-proof this time.\"\n\nBut Hanlon, disgusted as he was at the way they truckled to Irad,\nafraid of their skins, touched their minds and read the wonder they\nfelt as to what had so changed Irad this past year. He had always been\nambitious and, since being designated Second-In-Line, somewhat inclined\nto be dictatorial and overbearing.\n\nBut, their puzzled thoughts said, he had never been vicious, or\ndisplayed the killing instinct he was now showing. Too, his looks, his\naging, worried them. They shook their heads with anxiety, as they began\nmaking new plans.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 18\n\n\nIt was some two hours later when Hanlon, in his own body, heard steps\noutside, and the sound of a key in his prison door. It opened, and one\nof the palace guard officers stood in the doorway.\n\n\"Well, you're awake,\" he said. \"You sober now?\"\n\n\"I never was drunk,\" Hanlon snapped, sitting erect to give his\nthought-out alibi. \"I was working there in the stables, and felt myself\ngetting faint. I managed to stagger into the tackroom, where I knew\nthere was a cot--and that's all I remember until I found myself here.\"\n\n\"The head groom said you were drunk, and had us arrest you and bring\nyou here. But you don't look like a man who had been dead drunk a few\nhours ago.\"\n\n\"Come smell my breath. You'll see I wasn't. In fact, I very seldom\ntake even a drink of mild toxo and I haven't had any of that for many\nperiods. Mykkyl's my drink.\"\n\nThe guard came close, sniffing, and Hanlon continued his prepared but\nnecessary lie. \"Ever since I was a boy I've been subject to these\nfainting spells. I'm getting so I can usually feel one coming on, and\ngo lie down somewhere. In half an hour or so I wake up and am all right\nagain until the next seizure. They usually come only two or three times\na year.\"\n\nThe officer scratched his head. \"Can't smell no liquor. Guess you must\nbe telling the truth. In that case, there's no sense keeping you here.\nYou can leave if you want to.\"\n\n\"Thanks, friend. I suppose it was a natural reaction, after seeing me\nunconscious.\"\n\nHanlon walked out of the little residence jail, and went back to his\nroom in the groom's quarters. There he sat down to plan what his next\nmoves would be.\n\n\"I've got to warn the Ruler some way, and make sure he is really\nprotected,\" he thought. \"But how can I do that? Maybe he likes me well\nenough to promote me to a place in his guards. Oh, if I could only talk\nto dad about all this. I need his help and advice. Dare I take the time\nto start hunting for him again? Or must I keep on working here?\"\n\nHis heart clamored for him to do so, but he made himself consider every\nangle and connotation of his situation as coldly and logically as\npossible, as though the admiral was just that, and not also his beloved\nfather.\n\nHe should, Hanlon supposed, warn the Ruler. On the other hand, he knew\nAmir was no fool, and that as a result of his near-death the past few\nhours, he would certainly be taking greater care of himself than ever?\nIncidentally, Hanlon wondered, how badly was Amir hurt?\n\nWas there anything further he (Hanlon) could do about it?\n\nHe thought and thought, but could not see just how, without giving\neverything away. Perhaps he could get word to young Inver, to keep a\nmore careful watch over his father. But trying that, too, would be a\ngive-away. Was it time for that? Time for him to come out into the open\nand appear as a Terran and a member of its Inter-Stellar Corps?\n\nSSM George Hanlon had matured tremendously under all the experiences he\nhad undergone since joining the secret service, but he was still only\na very young man. Such problems as these were really far above him, he\nfelt--were things he simply did not have sense enough to figure out\ncorrectly. Not enough experience; not enough brains, he told himself\nwith what he thought was an honest evaluation.\n\nNevertheless, he knew he was alone, that it was up to him, and that he\nhad to make a decision one way or another.\n\nBut part of that decision was not left up to him. He was interrupted in\nthe midst of his cogitations by the sudden opening of his room's door.\nHe looked up in annoyance--and it was Endar.\n\n\"Pack your things and get out,\" the head groom said harshly. \"I've seen\nthe Ruler, told him about your disgraceful act of being drunk on duty,\nand have his permission to discharge you. He was very disappointed in\nyou, he said.\"\n\nBeneath his harshness Hanlon could easily detect the man's fierce\nsatisfaction at having thus rid himself of a potential (as he thought)\ncompetitor. From his reading of the other's mind, Hanlon knew that\nEndar had _not_ talked this over with the Ruler, and was doing it on\nhis own. But the young S S man did not dare reveal his knowledge of\nthat fact at this moment.\n\nSo he made himself say plaintively, \"But I wasn't drunk. I felt one of\nmy fainting spells coming on, and ran into the tackroom to lie down\nwhile it was on me.\"\n\n\"A trumped-up excuse, which doesn't help,\" Endar sneered. \"Even if it\nwas true, which I know it isn't, we don't want such people working\nhere. So get out--and fast.\" He threw some money on the bed, as wages,\nand left.\n\nIn a way Hanlon was rather glad. It did help solve some of his\nproblems, in that it left him freer to go and come where and when he\nwished. So he made no further protests, but silently packed his things,\npocketed the money Endar had left, and went out and got his trike and\nrode back to Stearra. He wondered if his old rooms had yet been taken\nby someone else.\n\nWhen he reached the building where he had been living, he parked his\ntricycle in the shed in the back yard, and went up to his old apartment.\n\nThe padlock and hasp had been forced, and the door was closed but\nunlocked. He opened it and went in just the same, for there were\nstill some of his things there. He was determined to get them, even if\nsomeone else was living here now.\n\nBut the moment he got inside he sensed something changed. He stood\nquietly, letting his mind _sniff_ at the feeling, trying to figure out\nwhat it was. He thought he heard a slight noise in the next room, and\ntiptoed softly across to the door. It was, he now saw, slightly ajar,\nand he peered through the crack. Someone was lying on his bed--an older\nEstrellan male, he judged by the longer, heavier beard.\n\nSomething about that face seemed familiar.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_The being in the spaceship high above the surface of this planet had\nbeen growing more and more puzzled and unsure of itself during the past\nseveral days. Its plans seemed to be going all awry--and it was not\nquite sure why._\n\n_That native it had been controlling had not acted as he was supposed\nto act. Or rather, things had happened that had made it impossible for\nhim to act always as directed. Even to the being the strange behavior\nof those four-legged beasts for riding, that had ruined its carefully\nprepared plan, was completely unexplainable._\n\n_And there was still the problem of that one unreadable mind on this\nworld. Various things the being had done or caused to be done had\nenabled it, through its high-powered, multiphased scanner, to SEE the\nentity and keep track of its various goings and comings, but all its\nmost intense efforts had not yet been able to touch that mind._\n\n_That this entity was working with those others who had such a\ndifferent mind-texture from the usual run of Estrellans, it had long\nsince proved to its satisfaction. The being now knew what these others\nwere, and what they were trying to do on this planet. But who or what\nthat unreadable entity was, what it was doing, and why--all this had so\nfar defied the being's utmost powers._\n\n_So it was puzzled and as nearly worried as it was possible for one\nof its race to be. Also, for the first time during its very long life,\nthe being was beginning to lose a little of its supreme faith in its\nown abilities. It was almost beginning to wonder if it was possible for\nitself to fail in its mission? But that was unthinkable._\n\n_And yet, it almost wailed mentally, that entity MUST be working toward\nthe same ends as those others. Was it their master?_\n\n_For nearly two Estrellan days and nights it had been considering\ncarefully and minutely all the data so far acquired, and what its\nnext actions should be. One thing it had early decided--there was no\nfurther use for confining or controlling those other two strange-minded\ncreatures from that other system. It therefore released the \"flee\"\ncompulsion from the one, and caused the \"jailer\" to open the doors and\nallow the other to leave its prison._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs George Hanlon stared at that figure on the bed, he reached out\nmentally and touched its mind. Instantly he let out a yell of delight,\nflung wider the door, and ran to the bedside.\n\n\"Dad, you're free!\"\n\nAdmiral Newton woke, saw his son, and pushed himself erect. But as\nhe did so a grimace of pain crossed his face, and Hanlon was all\nsolicitude.\n\n\"What's the matter, dad?\"\n\n\"Guess I'm not in very good shape,\" his father managed to grin. \"Been\nhalf-starved and tortured a bit. But never mind that now. I'm glad to\nsee you. When I was freed, I figured the quickest way to find you was\nto come here and wait. Guessed you'd be back sometime.\"\n\n\"Just lucky I did. Things worked out a bit differently than I expected,\nor I might never have come back here.\"\n\nHe explained in short, terse sentences what he had been doing and what\nhe thought he had accomplished so far.\n\n\"So you see, dad,\" he concluded, \"why I'm doubly glad to see you, both\nbecause it means you're free, and so you can advise me what we're to do\nnext.\"\n\n\"Hmmm,\" the admiral thought swiftly. \"We've got to do something\nimmediately, that's for sure. Of course, I have the authority to\napproach Amir as a Terran, in case of need. But do you know for sure,\"\nhe bent a penetrating gaze on the young man, \"whether or not the Ruler\nhas decided in our favor?\"\n\n\"No,\" Hanlon said honestly. \"I don't know that. But it seems as though\nhe should have, now that he knows what Irad was trying to do, and why.\nIf we go to him at once, and urge him properly, as well as explain why\nwe are here and how we were trying to protect him, he should swing over\nour way. At least, that's what I'd about decided I ought to do.\"\n\nThe admiral was again silent, his brow creased in a deep frown of\nthought. Suddenly he snapped his fingers in decision, and looked up.\n\"We'll do it. I have uniforms hidden in one of my hide-outs here, and\nwe'll get rid of our disguises and go see him.\"\n\nHe climbed from the bed, and Hanlon gasped as he saw how emaciated his\nfather was, and the marks of his torture. But the admiral dressed, then\nboth went down and climbed aboard Hanlon's motor-trike.\n\nBut when they got to Newton's room, another surprise awaited them. For\nHooper was there, waiting for Newton as the admiral had waited for\nHanlon.\n\nAfter mutual exchanges of experience, the three thankfully began\nremoving their Estrellan disguises, worn so long and so uncomfortably.\nTheir clothing off, they jumped beneath the pipe-shower, and as the\nwater softened the hair and plastic, they took off their false ears and\nnoses, and ripped the hair from their bodies. Then they shaved their\nbeards, and more or less trimmed each other's hair to the best of their\nability.\n\n\"Boy, does this feel good?\" Hanlon cavorted, naked, about the little\nroom, while his father and Hooper laughed their own relief.\n\nAdmiral Newton pulled a large travelling-case from beneath his low bed,\nunlocked the three complicated and pick-proof locks, and took out some\nuniforms. The others looked their astonishment, and he grinned. \"Didn't\nknow I had yours, too, did you?\"\n\nClean, shaved and dressed in their uniforms, with the symbols of their\nranks on the collars and shoulder tabs, the three sat comfortably in\neasy chairs, discussing plans and telling more fully what each had\ndiscovered.\n\nHanlon learned that the plot had been far more wide-spread than he\nrealized. Almost every city on the planet had a cell working at the\nspreading of the propaganda against Estrella's joining the Terran\nFederation, and the lesser rumors about the insanity of Inver, the\nRuler's son. He now learned the real reason for that whispering\ncampaign, and wondered how he had missed it before. Inver stood\nThird-In-Line, and would become the Ruler after Amir if anything\nhappened to Irad.\n\nBoth Hooper and Newton, who had worked more exclusively in other cities\nthan Stearra, knew the names of most of the native Estrellans who\nheaded these cells, and they could be picked up and arrested when the\ntime came. The crime wave had been quite wide-spread, also, as had the\nwhispers that the Terrans were to blame for it.\n\nThe other two were loud in their praise of Hanlon's work in uncovering\nthe real head of the plot, and his splendid work in saving the Ruler's\nlife when his assassination had been so carefully planned.\n\nIt was noticeable that the junior S S man no longer took their praise\nwith the cockiness he had formerly exhibited. In fact, he was actually\napologetic and uncomfortable. He squirmed and blushed, and tried to\nminimize what he had done.\n\nGeorge Spencer Newton Hanlon, secret serviceman of the Inter-Stellar\nCorps, had finally grown up.\n\nIt was so late when they completed their plans that Admiral Newton\ndecided they had best wait until morning before seeking an audience\nwith the planetary ruler. Besides, he and Hooper both needed all the\nrest they could get, before embarking on any new campaign.\n\nHanlon prepared the best meal he could from the meager supplies in the\nadmiral's room, and they all ate, then went to bed.\n\nBut deep down in his inner consciousness, a warning bell seemed to be\nringing as George Hanlon lay in bed. It took him many long, anxious\nminutes of intense concentration before he was able to isolate the\nfeeling from the many new items that had been talked about that\nevening. But he finally brought it into focus in his mind. He sat\nupright, disturbing his father, who was almost asleep.\n\n\"What's the matter, Spence?\" sleepily.\n\n\"Amir,\" Hanlon said with agitation. \"He ought not to be left unguarded\nlike this. Those gangsters, led by Irad, are sure to make another\nattempt to kill him--and quickly, now that Irad has tipped his hand.\"\n\n\"But what can we do?\" Hooper was also sitting up on the blanket-pallet\nthat had been spread for him on the floor of this small, one-bed room.\n\n\"I ... don't ... know,\" Hanlon said slowly. \"I ... I can probably\nwatch, through a bird or something, what's going on. But if they try\nanything....\"\n\nNewton started to climb out of bed. \"I'll go notify the residence\nofficials. Maybe we can alert his guards to be more watchful.\"\n\nHanlon was still worried. \"I don't know about that, either. Maybe some\nof them have been planted by Irad ... and if we say anything to the\nwrong ones it might merely hasten their plans.\"\n\n\"That sounds reasonable,\" Hooper said. \"Irad would certainly never\noverlook a chance like that.\"\n\n\"If he could make it,\" Newton admitted, lying down again. \"Maybe you'd\nbetter keep watch, Spence, since you know how. If you see anything\nstarting, we'll do our darnedest to break it up.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_And in its spaceship the alien being awoke the Estrellan native it had\nbeen controlling for so long, and impressed certain commands on his\nmind--nor was the native able any longer to make any attempt, however\nfeeble, to resist. Continued compulsion had at last weakened his will\nto the point where all suggestions and commands were instantly obeyed\nwithout question._\n\n_He therefore rose, dressed, equipped himself with a flamegun and\ncertain other instruments, and left the house where he had been hiding\nout._\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 19\n\n\nAlthough George Hanlon had become adept at the use of the minds of\nbirds, animals, fish, rodents and insects even at a considerable\ndistance, he could not project his mind to any great length to find and\ngain control of such a mind, unless he had already used that mind and\nknew its texture and characteristics, or unless another part of his\nmind was already at that distant point in another brain.\n\nThus, in the present instance, he could not project his mind the many\nmiles between his present location and the residence of the Ruler, Elus\nAmir, and find an animal or bird mind he could take over. He could\nhave done it, that is, with one of the cavals he had at various times\nhandled, but one of them could not get into the palace and the Ruler's\nsuite. Nor could he locate any of the birds he had used out there.\n\nHe did, however, project his mind into Inver's caval--the one he had\nhelped heal--and from that vantage point tried to find a bird he could\ncontrol. But none seemed to be anywhere near the stables.\n\nSo, he had to start closer to where he was, and work outward. With time\nof the essence at the moment, a bird must be used. Just how he was to\nget a bird into the residence, and more or less keep it inconspicuous\nand unseen during his survey, was a problem that would have to be\ntackled when the time came.\n\nLying on the bed in the little room, therefore, he quested about the\nnearby neighborhood trees until he found a swift-flying bird he could\nuse. It took but a moment to do so, and to take full and complete\ncontrol of its mind and body. Then the bird, whose brain now contained\nas large a portion of Hanlon's mind as he could force into it, was\nwinging at its top speed toward the official residence of Amir, the\nRuler.\n\n\"The palace is in sight,\" Hanlon's voice was low but penetrant, after a\ntime. \"I'm looking for an open window or door.\"\n\nThe other men watched with amazement and intense curiosity as the young\nman lay there on the bed, his eyes closed and his face drawn with\nconcentration, as they could see in the dim light of the shaded lamp\nHooper had risen and lighted. Both of the other S S men knew much of\nwhat Hanlon could thus do, yet watching him do it was a new experience\nto both, and one that filled them with deepest wonder and a sort of awe.\n\nThe silence, even though of only two or three minutes duration, seemed\nlike hours to the waiting watchers, then a jubilant \"Ah!\" let them know\nHanlon had succeeded in the first part of his quest. \"Got in through an\nopen window in an upper story ... heck, the door's shut.\"\n\nAnother pause, and then the voice continued, \"Here's another. Hah, this\none opens into a hallway. Now, which way is Amir's suite?\"\n\nThey waited with impatience while they knew the bird Hanlon was\ncontrolling was seeking the proper portion of the interior of that\ngreat building. It seemed long and long before the soft voice spoke\nagain.\n\n\"He must have gone to bed--the door is shut. I'll have to get outside\nand try again, but now that I know where it is I'll see if I can get\ndirectly into his room.\"\n\nHooper whispered in a tone he thought only Newton could hear. \"By the\nshade of Snyder, but this is spooky. If I didn't know he could really\ndo it, I'd swear it was impossible.\"\n\nBut only a portion of Hanlon's mind was in that distant avian brain.\nThe rest was here in his own body, and heard the comment.\n\n\"Yeh,\" he drawled, \"I know it's weird, and even I'm not used to\nthinking about it yet. Never thought how it would affect others. You\ndon't need to whisper, though. The two parts of my mind are separate\nand distinct, so that I know what is going on in both ... ah, one of\nthe windows in the bedroom is opened, but only a crack. Maybe I can\nsqueeze ... did it, but I lost a few feathers. But I'm inside now.\nLet's see. There's a molding quite high up on the wall. It's wide\nenough so I can roost on that, sideways. Now we'll just have to wait\nand watch.\"\n\n\"Is Amir all right?\" his father asked anxiously.\n\nHanlon grinned. \"The way he's snoring he must be.\"\n\nBut the question reminded Hanlon that the Ruler had been wounded. He\nmade the bird fly down to the bed, and through its eyes saw only a\nsmall bandage on one of Amir's arms--luckily for him the Ruler slept\nwith his arms outside the covers. \"Must be he got only a slight burn,\nafter all,\" he said.\n\n\"Is there anyone close to his room--or can't you tell?\" the admiral\nasked after a few moments of silence.\n\n\"I'll see if I can find out.\" Hanlon sent his mind questing out from\nthe bird, and soon reported, \"There're two men in an adjoining\nroom ... they're guards ... from what I can read of their minds they're\nnot thinking any seditious or murderous thoughts. Just playing a game\nof some sort while keeping on watch.\"\n\n\"Better keep checking them from time to time, though, hadn't you?\"\nHooper asked.\n\n\"Yeh, it'd be a good idea.\"\n\nThe other men were tired and not well, and despite their efforts to\nkeep awake, dropped off to sleep. Surprisingly, even Hanlon's body and\nthe main portion of his mind also lapsed into the unconsciousness of\nsleep. But the part in the bird kept awake--and so did the tiny thread\nof consciousness that connected it with Hanlon.\n\nSome time later, about midnight, Hanlon, through the bird, heard a\nstirring sound in the anteroom, and investigated. The guard was being\nchanged, and these two newcomers, he found from their minds, were tools\nof Irad.\n\nAlong that thread of thought sped the warning, and Hanlon's body and\nthe balance of his mind came fully awake. He lay there for some time,\nstudying the situation, but nothing seemed to be happening. He was\nalmost back to sleep again--his body, that is--when the bird heard a\nfumbling at the door of Amir's room, although the sound was softly\nmuted as though the one out there was using the utmost stealth in hopes\nof not being discovered. Hanlon's mind quickly investigated, and found\nonly one mind there. Evidently the guards had left, for this was a new\npersonality.\n\nHanlon reached out a hand and shook his father into wakefulness.\n\"Someone's outside, trying to get Amir's door unlocked, or opened,\" he\nreported.\n\nNewton called Hooper, who sat up, rubbing sleep from his eyes while the\nadmiral explained in swift words.\n\n\"The door's locked from the inside, and the key is still in the lock,\"\nHanlon told them. \"I made the bird fly down and look ... whoever is at\nit must be using something like pliers to try to turn the key.\"\n\nAdmiral Newton jumped out of bed, lit the lamp, and commanded Hooper,\n\"Get up and dress. We'll have to rush out there.\" He turned to Hanlon.\n\"Can you come with us, and still keep _en rapport_ with your bird?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Hanlon was already throwing off the covers, and getting up.\n\"The fellow, whoever he is, although I would imagine it might be Irad,\nis having trouble with the key, but he'll probably make it sooner or\nlater.\"\n\n\"D'you suppose we can get out there in time?\" Hooper asked.\n\n\"We'll certainly try,\" the admiral grunted, leaning down to fasten his\nshoes.\n\n\"Can you wake the Ruler?\" he asked anxiously, a few moments later. \"He\nmight have a better chance, if awake.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Hanlon said, and a moment later, \"the bird flew down and\nbrushed its wingtips across his face. He's awake now ... he's sitting\nup ... lighting the lamp ... I sent the bird close to him then over to\nthe door ... he's watching it ... now he sees the key turning ... he's\njumped out of bed ... running to another door leading out of the room.\"\n\nThe three finished dressing, and now ran from the room and down the\nstairs. Outside the admiral commanded \"Follow me,\" and ran toward\nthe back of the house. They saw the dim outlines of a shed, and a\nhigh-powered, family-sized touring tricycle. They piled into the seats\neven as the admiral was getting it started.\n\nSwiftly he backed the car out and into the street, and then took off\nwith a full-throated roar from the powerful, souped-up engine.\n\n\"Special job the Corps' experts fixed up for me,\" he explained as the\nothers gasped at the unexpected speed.\n\nHanlon, through the bird's eyes, was still watching that distant effort\nto unlock the door, and relaying to the others from time to time what\nhe was seeing.\n\n\"Ah, it's unlocked ... it's opening ... but the Ruler is in the other\nroom and has locked that door.\"\n\n\"The old boy's not so dumb,\" Hooper applauded.\n\n\"I'll say he isn't,\" Hanlon agreed joyfully. \"He's plugging the\nkeyhole.\"\n\nHe was silent a moment, then exclaimed, \"The intruder's Irad, just as\nI thought it might be ... he's surprised the Ruler isn't in bed\nasleep ... he's gone over to try the other door ... he's found\nit's locked and the keyhole plugged ... he seems to have lost his\nhead--he's pounding on that door, and yelling.\"\n\nHe half-straightened, then slumped down into his seat, and his face\nstrained with concentration. Hooper, in the back seat, leaned forward\nand started to speak, but Newton restrained him. \"Let him alone,\nCurt--he must be working on something difficult.\"\n\nHanlon was beating at the barriers in Adwal Irad's mind, trying to get\nin, even though he knew he had never been able to do so before. But\nit was all he could think of to do at the moment, and he had to do\nsomething. Besides, it was plain to him now that the man was completely\ninsane--the way Irad was acting and the things he was saying and\nthinking showed it so clearly. So Hanlon had withdrawn entirely from\nthe bird's mind, and was now working on Irad's with all his power.\n\nThe Second-In-Line had drawn his flamegun and was firing at the door,\ntrying to burn out the lock or through the door panels.\n\nHanlon was almost in a frenzy of desperation. They had to stop\nthis madman someway. He knew his father was pushing his car at its\nunexpected top speed, and that they would be there in a matter of\nminutes. But he was afraid that even those minutes might be too late.\nHe did not see how they could possibly get there in time. For the door\nwas beginning to burn from the fierce heat of the flamer.\n\nHanlon still beat at that barrier in Irad's mind. He seemed to sense\nsomehow that it was weakening, was ... was disintegrating ... was\nchanging horribly under the influence of hatred and the madness the man\nseemed to feel.\n\nAll this time the admiral had been trying to coax even more speed out\nof his souped-up tricycle, and now in the swiftly-nearing distance they\ncould see the few lights that denoted the residence. Soon they were\nclose enough to see that the gates were closed.\n\n\"Those gates strong ones?\" Newton asked without turning his head.\n\n\"No, mostly ornamental.\"\n\n\"Hang on, then, we're going through. Curt, grab the kid.\"\n\nHooper leaned forward, took hold of Hanlon's shoulders with his strong\nhands, and braced himself against the back of the front seat in which\nthe younger man was sitting.\n\nA couple of guards had run up to the gate at sight and sound of that\nspeeding machine. But they ducked hastily back as they saw it was\nneither going to stop nor swerve.\n\nThere was a rocking jolt, a crash, and the car was past the crumpled\ngates, careening wildly. The admiral fought the wheel with all his\nstrength. By the time they came close to the steps leading up to the\nmain entrance, he had it under control.\n\nThere was a screech of brakes that brought several attendants on the\nrun through the door. The trike slid to a halt, and two of the three\nmen in it jumped out and dashed up the stairs.\n\n\"The Ruler's being attacked,\" the admiral cried imperiously. \"One of\nyou show us his rooms.\"\n\nA servant, half-dazed by sight of those strangers in their peculiar\nuniforms, and subconsciously controlled by the command in Newton's\nvoice, obeyed.\n\nThey raced across the entrance foyer to the great stairs that led to\nthe upper story. Other servants were coming into the hallway, sleepily\nrubbing their eyes, and most of them only partially dressed. Their\nwondering eyes followed the racing men in a stupefied way, but none\ntried to stop the intruders.\n\n\"Down here,\" the servant dashed into a side hallway, and the two secret\nservicemen pounded after him.\n\nThey turned another corner, and the servant slid to a stop. Two guards\nwere standing there, flamers in their hands, menacing a small group of\nservants.\n\nNewton took it all in with a single glance. From what Hanlon had\nsaid he knew the men were Irad's. \"Burn those guards!\" he snapped\nthe command at Hooper, and the latter's blaster spoke twice--fierce\nblasts of death that made the flashes of the flameguns seem like\ncandle-flames. The two guards died instantly.\n\nNewton and the servant were already dashing into Amir's bedroom.\n\nMeanwhile, back in the machine where he had stayed, Hanlon was still\nworking on Irad's mind. Now he thought he perceived a minute opening\ntoward one edge of that decomposing barrier. He attacked it with all\nhis mental strength, and it began to crumble a bit faster. Further\nand further Hanlon dug away at that tottering mentality until there\nwas an orifice completely through the shield. Instantly he pushed his\nmind through ... down and down, in and into the deeper parts of Irad's\nthoughts and memories.\n\nAnd his body stiffened suddenly at what he found.\n\nNewton and the servant pushed on ahead into the bedroom, just in time\nto see the man, Irad, sink to the floor, writhing in apparent pain.\n\nBut even so there was still enough control in the maddened conspirator\nso that he swung his flamegun and sent a streak of fire flashing toward\nthe intruders.\n\nThe servant, not expecting such a thing, and slow of reflexes, caught\nmost of the blast, and died almost instantly. Newton, trained to quick\naction and always expecting the unexpected, ducked down and away.\nEven so, an edge of the flame caught him in the shoulder. The sudden,\nintolerable pain threw him off balance, and he sank to the floor, his\nuninjured hand grasping the wound, trying to stanch the flow of blood.\n\nGeorge Hanlon was still in the tricycle, his mind a welter of\nconflicting emotions. He must be nuts--such a thing as he had just\ndiscovered was simply not possible.\n\n\"But it is,\" a cold, precise, soundless voice spoke in his mind. \"It is\nnot the mind of this Adwal Irad you are now contacting, but that of\nanother, who has been controlling this entity for some time now.\"\n\n\"Who ... who are you, then?\" Hanlon gasped.\n\n\"I am from another, distant section of this galaxy, here on much the\nsame errand as yourself and your assistants. I am banding together the\nvarious inhabited planets in my sector the same as your Federation is\ndoing in yours. This planet is about midway between the two groups. I\ndiscovered it some time ago, and after thorough study of it decided to\nannex it to my oligarchy. But I have failed, and you have won.\"\n\n\"You mean you were responsible for all the opposition we've\nencountered?\" Hanlon asked in surprise.\n\n\"That is correct. Working through the mind of this now-dying entity\ncalled Adwal Irad, I caused certain things to be done, including the\nincrease in what you call crimes, in hopes they would alienate these\npeople from your Federation's invitation, which was made shortly before\nI came here to work. It was my plan to make them join with me after\ndenying you, and for certain things promised this Irad in the way of\npersonal power, he more or less agreed--although I had to force him on\nseveral occasions.\"\n\n\"So that's why he changed so,\" Hanlon now knew the answers to many\npuzzles.\n\n\"Yes, there was continual conflict in Irad's mind. It was conditioned\nto a love and loyalty for his world, and certain ethics of what he\nconsidered the fundamentals of right and wrong, that are totally\nunknown to me. In fact, these people are almost non-understandably\ndifferent from the races in my oligarchy, but they have many resources\nI need. Thus the disturbance between what this Irad innately felt and\nwhat I forced him to do, drove him insane. Even now his body is dead,\nand I am keeping his mind alive merely while I converse with you--a\nthing I have wished to do for long and long. I shall leave now, for my\nproject has failed. I congratulate you on your victory.\"\n\nThere was a moment's hesitation, then the thought came again to Hanlon.\n\"But there is one thing I would like to know before I go.\"\n\nThere was almost a trace of pleading, of indecision in that hitherto\ncoldly logical, precise thought--and Hanlon wondered anew what sort\nof being this could possibly be with whom he was telepathing. For he\ncould perceive nothing whatever as to the bodily shape or size of this\nenigmatic stranger.\n\n\"Why was I unable to make contact with your mind?\" the alien asked,\nand its thoughts were almost a wail. \"I perceive now that you are very\nyoung, very immature and inexperienced. I should have been able to read\nyou easily. My abilities must be very small indeed, even though I have\nalways considered myself so competent. Are you of a different race from\nthose others with whom you worked? I know you are not a native of this\nplanet, for your mind texture is far different from theirs, as is your\nfellows'. Even as yours, in some ways, differs from theirs.\"\n\n\"I honestly do not know the answer,\" Hanlon thought frankly. \"I am\nof the same race as my companions, but I have some slight additional\nmental powers not usually found in my people. It may be I have a\nnatural block or barrier in my mind they do not possess.\"\n\n\"It must be so. I could make no contact with you at all, whereas I\ncould penetrate and control easily with the others. It is only now,\nwhile we are jointly tenanting this weaker mind, that I can converse\nwith you through its brain--I still cannot do so directly. It is very\npuzzling ...\" and Hanlon felt the withdrawal of that mind.\n\nIrad's body, now that the mind which had been keeping it not-dead, or\nsemi-alive, had slumped to the floor in full death.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 20\n\n\nCaptain George Hanlon jumped from the big tricycle and ran into the\nresidence. None of the guards or servants tried to stop him, so\ndumb-founded were they by all that had been happening. Knowing the way\nfrom his controlling of the bird that had found Amir's rooms, Hanlon\nwas soon there. He did not stop to see what was happening to the\nothers, but ran across the bedroom to that far door, and rapped on it\nto attract the attention of the Ruler, hiding behind it.\n\n\"Everything is safe now, k'nyer,\" he called through the badly charred\npanels. \"The assassin is dead. You can come out now.\"\n\n\"Is this some new trick?\" a voice came thinly.\n\n\"No, sire, it is no trick, but the truth. You are safe now.\"\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\n\"I'm ...\" Hanlon started to give his name, then remembered that the\nRuler did not know anything about him. He quickly changed it to,\n\"I'm Ergo Lona, the groom with whom you talked on the ride the other\nmorning.\"\n\n\"Lona? Where did you disappear to--and why?\" suspiciously.\n\n\"Endar discharged me, but I have been watching over you, just the same.\nOn my honor, k'nyer, you may believe me.\"\n\nAfter some further hesitation there was the sound of the padding being\nremoved from the keyhole, the insertion and turning of the key. As the\ndoor opened a mere crack, Elus Amir peered cautiously out. But instead\nof the clothing of a groom or a countryman, he saw the brilliant\nspace-blue and silver of an Inter-Stellar Corps uniform.\n\nHe started to pull shut the door, but Hanlon had stuck the toe of his\nboot in it.\n\n\"It's all right, k'nyer. I am Lona, the groom. I am also George Hanlon,\na captain in the Terran Inter-Stellar Corps. We discovered that another\nattempt was being made on your life, and were lucky enough to get here\nin time to block it.\"\n\nHe took hold of the edge of the door and pulled it open, for the Ruler\nwas so surprised by this revelation that he made no real effort to hold\nit shut. Amir came slowly, surprisedly into the bedroom, staring keenly\nat Hanlon.\n\n\"You don't look like Lona ... but the voice does seem to be the same.\nHow does it happen the Federation has men here? Were you spying on me?\"\n\n\"Not on you, sire, but on your enemies,\" Hanlon said earnestly. \"Let me\nintroduce you to Admiral New....\"\n\nHe had half-turned back as he spoke, and now for the first time saw his\nfather on the floor, a hand clutching his shoulder, from which a great\nstain of blood was drenching the uniform sleeve.\n\n\"Ring for your physician,\" Hanlon turned and commanded the Ruler. Then,\nrealizing this was no way for him to be addressing a planetary head, he\nquickly but entreatingly added, \"please, k'nyer.\"\n\nElus Amir called in one of the servants clustered outside, and\ncommanded curtly, \"Get the doctor here, immediately.\" Then he went over\nto the two on the floor. \"Let me look,\" he half-pushed Hanlon aside,\nand stooped to peer closely at that wounded shoulder.\n\n\"Help me get him onto the bed,\" he said after a quick inspection. \"I\ndon't think any of the bone is gone--it's just a bad flesh burn.\"\n\nTenderly the two men raised the admiral, who protested weakly that he\ncould get up by himself, and lifted him onto the bed. Amir himself\nbegan pulling off the admiral's tunic, while Hanlon helped.\n\nBy the time the doctor came running in, and took over the dressing of\nthe wound, they had the arm and shoulder bared. But the elder Newton,\nin spite of his protestations, had fainted from the loss of blood and\nshock.\n\nAmir sent the assembled servants away, retaining only his dresser, who\nhelped him on with his day clothes.\n\nThe doctor worked swiftly, as Hanlon watched anxiously, applying\nointments to the burn, and finally bandaging it.\n\n\"He's weak from all the blood he lost, and doesn't seem to have been in\ntoo good condition anyway,\" the doctor said at last. \"I hope the man is\nstrong enough to pull through.\"\n\n\"Then give him some plasma,\" Hanlon said frantically. \"He needs it.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean,\" the doctor was bewildered by the word,\nfor Hanlon had had to use the Terran word \"plasma\", not knowing any\ntranslation for it.\n\n\"A blood transfusion, then, or at least some glucose.\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about those, either ... say, you're not an\nEstrellan, are you?\"\n\n\"No, we're Terrans. You mean you folks don't know anything about giving\none person's blood to another?\"\n\n\"Sorry, but I've never heard of such a thing. How is it done?\" The\ndoctor was apparently more interested in this new idea than in the\nadmiral's desperate condition.\n\nHanlon felt faint. He staggered away from the bedside without\nanswering, and went into the anteroom, where Hooper stood talking to\nInver and some other officials, who had heard the commotion and had\ncome to see what it was all about.\n\nHooper saw Hanlon's haggard face, and knew something was wrong. \"Were\nwe too late?\" he gasped.\n\n\"Oh, no, we got Irad and saved Amir, but dad was blasted--shoulder. The\ndoctor has fixed him up as best he can, but dad's in shock, and these\nbackward fools never heard of plasma or blood transfusions.\"\n\nHooper jumped forward. \"I can give a transfusion. What's your dad's\nblood type?\" he asked as they hurried to the bedside.\n\n\"Same as mine,\" Hanlon was peeling off his coat as he spoke, his eyes\nlighting with relief.\n\nHooper rapped quick questions at the doctor, but the latter shook his\nhead. More questions, and more negative answers, then Hooper turned\ndisconsolately to Hanlon. \"They don't even have anything I could use to\ngive a transfusion; no hollow needles; not even hypodermics.\"\n\nThe doctor pulled on Hooper's arm. \"Please, tell me what you mean by\nblood transfusions, and plasma. How do you give them? What for? And\nwhat did the other man mean when he said he had the same blood type as\nthe wounded man?\"\n\nHanlon went to sit beside his father's bedside, and sank into an\napparent mood of despair.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ruler had finished dressing, and with his son, Inver,\nwent over to listen to what Major Hooper was telling the doctor.\n\n\"Will you please tell me what all is going on here?\" Amir asked so\nplaintively that the S S man had trouble concealing a grin. But Hooper\nsobered instantly.\n\n\"The Federation's Inter-Stellar Corps, sire,\" he began his explanation,\n\"found out about the fact that opposition to your desire to accept\ntheir invitation was becoming stronger--and dangerous to you and to the\npeace of your planet. They sent four of us here to study the situation\nand to protect you if possible. To do that it was necessary for us to\ndisguise ourselves as natives of your world, so we could move about\nfreely and unnoticed. That is why Captain Hanlon worked it so you\nwould notice him, hire him as a servant of some sort here, and he would\nthus be able to watch over you and conditions in general from close\nat hand. We had found out that Adwal Irad was at the head of this\nopposition and crime wave, and that his plans included your death.\"\n\n\"But now you're all in uniform--and your disguises removed.\"\n\n\"Yes, k'nyer. We were planning to come as ourselves tomorrow--or\nrather, this morning--and seek an audience with you. We knew about the\nattempt to assassinate you that was made on your daily ride, and so\nwere watching you more carefully than ever. When we saw Irad trying to\nget into your room, and his men he had planted in your guards keeping\nback the servants who wished to come to your assistance, we hurried\nhere to help protect you. It was so apparent Irad was determined to\ncomplete the killing he failed at the other time.\"\n\nElus Amir, Ruler of Estrella, took that startling news with barely a\ntremor. He motioned them to a seat along the side of the bedroom, to\ncontinue his questioning.\n\nThe doctor was dismissed, although it was plain he wanted to stay and\nask this Terran more about those strange and new methods of treating\nwounds.\n\nSo until dawn the Ruler and his son--now Second-In-Line following the\ndeath of Irad--sat talking to Major Hooper about the Federation of\nPlanets, and the benefits Estrella would obtain from joining the other\nworlds.\n\n\"Such things as the advances in medicines in which your doctor is so\ninterested, are but minor matters among the many we can and gladly will\ntell you if you wish,\" Hooper said.\n\nThe Corpsman was able to convince Amir of the falsity of the rumors\nand arguments Irad had spread, about how Estrella would lose her\nsovereignty if she joined, and that Terra would make slaves of her\npeople.\n\n\"That is such a damnable thing to say, k'nyer,\" Hooper was almost\nangry, but very much in earnest. \"You have only to send some trusted\nadvisors to the various planets of the Federation--we will gladly\nfurnish them transportation as we did before--and have them talk to the\ncommon people of any or all of our worlds. They will find that while we\nof Terra were the ones who developed space travel and sent people to\ncolonize the first discovered and habitable planets, that the citizens\nof each world choose their own form of government, and that many of\nthem are now even stronger than is Terra, the mother world. And there\nare peoples of several worlds who are natives and not Terrans or their\ndescendants, whom we have not only not enslaved, but are helping to\ngrow culturally so they may some day be advanced enough to join us as\nfull-fledged equal members of the Federation, just as you, with your\nadvanced civilization, were invited to do.\"\n\nWhile all this conversation was going on in low tones across the room,\nGeorge Hanlon sat by the side of his father's bed, almost in a trance,\nso deep was his concentration.\n\nFrom what he had learned while breaking past the disintegrating\nbarriers in Adwal Irad's mind, and from the techniques he had learned\nto apply in his previous excursions into other minds, he now found\nthat, because his father was unconscious rather than merely asleep, he\ncould, in a way, by-pass those barriers and get down into the depths of\ncell and gland in his father's mind and body, even though he could not\nfully penetrate the block into the memories, nor control the elder's\nactions.\n\nCarefully Hanlon studied those depths, aided also by what he had\nlearned in his healing of the caval, and from his intensive studies of\nhuman physiology and neurones and allied sciences. Using the totality\nof his admittedly meager knowledge, yet guided by things no human\nphysician had so far learned, he at last began to trace the pattern of\nhow human cells, tissues and nerves regenerated themselves, and how new\nblood leucocytes are made in the glands of the lymph and the spleen. He\nwas able to trace the connectors between the minute organisms and the\nbrain that directed their activities.\n\nThen he set himself to the delicate task of activating those functions\nto begin and hasten the healing process.\n\nHour after hour he sat there, oblivious to all else taking place around\nhim, his own body lolling almost lifelessly in the big chair while\nall his mental powers were engaged in the monumental and hitherto\nunheard-of task to which he had set himself.\n\nThe other three men concluded their conference at last, and got up,\nstretching hugely to pull themselves more awake after their half-night\nvigil.\n\nAmir called in his servants, and ordered them to prepare and serve\nbreakfast here for himself and his guests. Inver ran back to his own\napartment to dress more completely for the day.\n\nHooper walked over to where Hanlon was sitting. \"Asleep?\" he\nhalf-whispered, doubtful because of the way the young man's body was\nsprawled in the deep chair.\n\nGeorge Hanlon stirred and sat up, flashing a smile. \"You didn't need to\nwhisper, Curt,\" he said. \"I wasn't asleep. Just been helping dad get\nwell.\"\n\nThe major stared at him in amazement. \"What d'you mean?\"\n\n\"You're half a doctor, Curt. Take a look at dad's wound.\"\n\nDoubtfully, not fully understanding even yet what his companion meant,\nHooper removed the bandage. He stared unbelievingly at the wounded\nshoulder. The deeper portions of that terrible burn were completely\nregenerated with healthy tissue. There was no sign of inflammation,\nno scarred tissue or fused flesh as usually shows in a fresh flamegun\nburn. The upper parts of the injury, too, were already beginning to\nheal toward the center.\n\n\"Why ... why,\" he was astounded. \"That should've taken weeks. I never\nknew a wound to heal that fast.\"\n\n\"I found out how to speed up the cells and things,\" Hanlon said simply.\n\nAdmiral Newton roused as they talked, perhaps at the touch of Hooper's\ngentle hands removing the bandage. Now he opened his eyes, and after\na moment to realize his surroundings and recall the events of his\ninjuries, smiled at his co-workers.\n\n\"Hi, fellows. Everything under control?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, all O K,\" Hooper answered. \"I think the Ruler is about ready\nto sign up.\"\n\n\"Good. Good work. Say, I feel fine. No pain--yet I seem to have a\nmemory of being blasted ... of fainting.\" He frowned, then shrugged.\n\"Couldn't have been much after all.\"\n\n\"It was very bad, sir,\" Hooper assured him gravely. \"The burn was\nalmost to the bone in your shoulder, and you lost a lot of blood. But\nnow the wound is over half-healed.\"\n\n\"Great John. How long was I out?\"\n\n\"Only a few hours, dad,\" Hanlon said.\n\n\"Oh, you found the kit, then?\"\n\n\"What kit?\"\n\n\"There's a complete emergency medi-surgical kit under the seat in my\ntricycle.\"\n\n\"Now he tells us,\" Hooper spread his hands and spoke in mock despair.\n\n\"Probably just as well,\" Hanlon said. \"If we'd known about that I might\nnever have felt the necessity of discovering how to heal wounds as I\ndid.\"\n\n\"What're you talking about?\" the admiral looked from one to the other\nin perplexity.\n\n\"The kid's too modest to tell you, sir,\" Hooper broke in, ignoring\nHanlon's signal to keep quiet. \"I don't pretend to know how he did it,\nbut somehow or other he managed, with his mind, to stimulate and speed\nup the healing, so that at the rate it's been going, your wound should\nbe all well in another twenty-four hours. I'll bandage it up again, and\nthen, unless you're too weak, you can get up and help us eat breakfast\nthe Ruler is having sent up for us all.\"\n\nYoung Inver, who had returned to the bedroom, was standing there,\nlistening to all this. Now his expressive eyes lighted up, and he\ntouched Hanlon's arm. When the young S S man turned to face him, Inver\nbreathlessly asked, \"Was that the way my caval got well so fast?\"\n\nHanlon grinned at him. \"I knew it was your favorite mount, and I didn't\nwant to see it destroyed.\"\n\nHe turned quickly back to help his father get up. The admiral found\nthat, while he was still a little shaky, he could stand up without\ndizziness. The Ruler had sent his uniform jacket out to be cleaned\nand mended, and this Newton donned. Soon the men were seated about\nthe table the servants had set up, eating the splendid breakfast they\nbrought and served.\n\nMeantime, the five talked about the problem that so much interested\nthem all, and that meant so much to all the peoples of their worlds.\n\n\"Our Colonial and Survey Bureaus are constantly seeking throughout\nspace for other planets having intelligent races, and we feel sure\nyours will not be the last we'll find,\" Admiral Newton told the Ruler\nand his son. \"It is egotistical and silly to think we Terrans are the\nonly civilized peoples in the universe.\"\n\n\"Chances are we'll find others who are as far ahead of us in\nintelligence, science and technologies as you Estrellans are ahead of\nus in ethics,\" Hanlon added honestly.\n\nAmir and Inver looked up in astonishment at that simple statement.\n\"You ... you actually mean ... honestly ... that you Terrans do not\nbelieve you are the highest form of life in the universe?\" Inver put\ntheir questioning into words.\n\n\"Great John, no!\" Admiral Newton exploded. \"Oh, I suppose,\" he added\nmore slowly, \"that there are some earth people who may still feel that\nway, but the majority of us do not, especially those who have travelled\nat all extensively. We used to think that; used to believe, hundreds\nof years ago, that we were the _only_ intelligent life in the cosmos.\nBut we know better now that we're spreading out. I, personally, have\nbeen on at least six planets that contain intelligent life that did not\nstem from Terra, although yours is the highest of the six, and none of\nthe rest are yet at the point where they can be asked to affiliate with\nthe Federation as equal members. But those others are being taught and\ncoached as best we can--and as much as they want to be. In a few more\ngenerations they'll probably have reached the point where they will be\nready to be seriously considered for equality status with us, as far as\nFederation membership is concerned.\"\n\n\"Just how do you determine the fitness of a race for membership in your\nFederation?\" Inver leaned forward, his expressive eyes questioning.\nHis father started to rebuke him for his forwardness, but the admiral\ninterrupted.\n\n\"No, that's a good question, and we're glad to answer it--just as\nwe're glad to answer _any_ questions to which we know the answers. As\nto this one, we look first for signs of intelligence great enough to\nenable the people to govern themselves without continual warfare,\" he\nsaid earnestly. \"Their knowledge of science and technology is not so\nimportant, we feel, although their ability to learn is. Some races will\nprobably never have real need for machines of any sort--races like the\nplant-men of Algon, where Captain Hanlon was recently instrumental in\nfreeing them from slavery.\"\n\nHe paused a moment to marshal his thoughts. \"Then we look to see\nif they are making a conscious effort to advance in education and\nlearning--no matter along what lines that may be,\" he continued.\n\"We study their knowledge of and interest in ethical matters--their\nreligion, and their belief in the general concept of right and wrong,\nof decency and observance of the rights of others. If they have these\nthings, and have, above all, the desire and determination to continue\ntheir cultural growth, then we consider them worthy of equal Federation\nmembership.\"\n\n\"And your wonderful people certainly measure up to all of those\nconcepts,\" Hanlon added sincerely.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 21\n\n\nThe five had finished eating by now, and the Ruler rose. \"I will call\nmy advisors together, and discuss this matter with them,\" he said. \"But\nI can tell you now that I am more than ever disposed to accept your\ninvitation. I could do so this moment,\" he said with a deprecating\nsmile, \"but I like to make sure that the leaders of my people agree\nwith my decisions, as much as possible. I will have a servant show you\nto my study, where you can discuss your own plans while my ministers,\nmy son and myself talk in the Council Chambers. I will let you know as\nsoon as we reach a definite decision.\"\n\n\"Thank you, k'nyer. We will gladly await your answer,\" Admiral Newton\nrose, too, and bowed, as did Hanlon and Hooper.\n\n\"And thanks for the fine meal,\" Hanlon grinned. \"I was really hungry.\"\n\nInver came up to him and laid his hand on Hanlon's shoulder. \"I like\nyou,\" he said simply but from the heart. \"I hope we shall always be\nfriends, and shall meet often through the coming years.\"\n\nIn the little study the three found easy chairs, and Admiral Newton\nturned first to Major Hooper. \"As far as I know now, we'll all be going\nback when the sneakboat comes in a day or so. I suggest you go back\nto Simonides and get in touch with the High Command to get your next\nassignment.\"\n\n\"Right, sir, will do.\"\n\n\"About you, Spence, I want you to come with me and....\"\n\n\"Excuse me, dad, but if I can have some free time, there is some very\nimportant research I want to do, that I think will benefit humanity\nmuch more than another detective assignment.\"\n\n\"What's on your mind, son?\"\n\n\"This new ability I'm beginning to get,\" Hanlon said seriously. \"I've\nfound I can get down to the level of the body cells and glands, with\nmy mind, and I think with more study and research I can learn things\nno one else has ever known before. But I'll need a lot of help from\nresearch doctors and endocrinologists, to tell me things I don't\nknow. I may be all wet, but I have an idea I can, in time, make some\nvery important contributions to medical science--with their help in\ntelling me what to look for, and if it can be arranged so I can have\nthe time to devote to that. I don't mean,\" he added, flushing with\nembarrassment, \"that I think I'm....\"\n\n\"You are, whether you think so or not,\" his father interrupted, eyes\ngleaming with pride and some amusement. \"With those special gifts of\nyours, you can do things no one else ever hoped to do. Such research\nwould certainly be worthwhile, especially if you can help others learn\nhow to heal wounds as fast as you did mine.\"\n\n\"Speaking of which,\" Hooper broke in, \"I suggest, admiral that you\nlie down while we're talking. It will be less strain on your body and\nheart, and you're still weak, even if you won't admit it,\" he added as\nhe saw a protest forming on Newton's lips.\n\nWhen Hanlon added his entreaties to Hooper's, the admiral grinned and\nlay down on a couch there in the study. \"Anybody'd think you guys were\nthe head men, not me,\" he growled, but good-naturedly.\n\nThen he sobered quickly and went back to their discussion. \"I'll have\nto take it up with the Board, of course, but I think they'll agree. I\nknow of nothing definite needing you right at the moment, so they'll\nprobably give you a leave of absence for that research.\"\n\n\"I'd like to go to some other planet than Terra or Simonides,\" Hanlon\nsaid. \"One where I'm not known, so I won't have to be watching out for\nanyone who might recognize me. And if I'm to do the study, I'll want\nauthorization to work at some of their insane asylums, too.\"\n\n\"Why those, in John's name?\"\n\n\"When I tackled Irad's mind towards the end, I was able to get down\ninside of it, further than I've ever been in any other person's mind,\nbecause he was insane at the last, and his mind was breaking down.\nThere seems to be a block or barrier in every sane person's mind that I\ncan't get through.\"\n\n\"But you got into your father's ...\" Hooper looked puzzled.\n\n\"In dad's case, Curt, it was only because he was unconscious, rather\nthan asleep or awake, that I could penetrate. Even then, I had to sort\nof ... well, by-pass the barrier ... to get down deep enough to touch\nthe cells and glands and such things. Of course, with more study and\npractice, now that I know more about it, I may be able to reach those\ndepths in spite of the block ... oh, heck, I sound like I considered\nmyself a sort of superman,\" he flushed again, and his eyes implored\nthem not to think him conceited.\n\n\"We know you neither are a superman nor think you are,\" his father\nassured him quickly. \"You have a special gift, and you are trying to\nuse it to benefit others, that's all. Don't be modest--it's really\nfalse modesty, in a way. Go ahead with your ideas.\"\n\n\"Well, I'd also like to try working with engineers and technies, to see\nif it would be possible to rig up some sort of a mechanical method of\ndoing the same thing.\"\n\nNewton shook his head in puzzled wonder. \"You're completely beyond\nunderstanding, Spence. I sometimes wonder if you're human ... if you're\nreally the son of Martha and myself.\"\n\n\"Why, no,\" Hanlon grinned then. \"Didn't you know? I'm a changeling the\nlittle elves left on your doorstep.\"\n\nHis father and Hooper laughed away the tension. \"Could be, at that,\"\nthe admiral said. \"Well, I'll certainly recommend to the Board that\nthey grant you all the time and opportunity you need. If you can get to\nthe bottom of this, and especially if you can teach other doctors how\nto get at those glands and use them....\"\n\n\"That'll be the hard part, dad. What I do hope to be able to do is to\nperhaps find out more exactly how the nerves and cells and glands work,\nand then doctors would be better able to diagnose and treat various\ndiseases and injuries.\"\n\nThey were interrupted by Inver, who came in to ask certain questions\nthe Ruler and advisors wished to know.\n\n\"Would it be possible, or rather, is it something you would permit,\" he\nasked, \"for us to set up some sort of an advanced school or university\nhere, and have you send us instructors? A place where our best young\nmen and women could go to study the many things we know nothing about?\"\n\n\"It certainly will be possible, and it is a wonderful idea,\" Admiral\nNewton assured him. \"And one thing we want to make clear, that you\ndo not yet seem sure of. That is that there is no question of our\n'permitting' you to do what you want to do. None whatever, in any\nway, shape or form. Your government is and will always be completely\nautonomous--always handled as you people see fit to work it. We never,\nunder any circumstances, try to make other races 'conform' to any\nstandards or regulations they do not wish to make their own. We will\ngive freely of our knowledge, our science and technologies, our beliefs\nand concepts--but you Estrellans will be the sole and only judge of\nwhat you want to accept.\n\n\"And we will want to have you send some of your people to our\nuniversities, to teach us the advanced things you know that we don't.\nYour system of ethics, for instance, and the way you have learned to\nlive together so closely and honestly.\"\n\nAfter Inver had gone back to the conference, the three men sat about\nwaiting. Newton had almost fallen asleep--Hooper was completely\nso--when Hanlon stirred.\n\n\"I don't know, though,\" he ruminated aloud. \"Maybe there's something\nelse more important than that research at the moment.\"\n\n\"What?\" his father roused himself sufficiently to ask.\n\n\"That alien being I contacted in Irad's mind.\"\n\n\"What in Snyder's name are you talking about?\" Newton raised up in\nexcitement. \"What alien?\"\n\n\"Oh, that's right, I didn't tell you. You're being hurt and my trying\nto heal you made me forget it.\" Hanlon explained swiftly about that\nstrange mind and its startling communication.\n\nAdmiral Newton swung his feet to the floor, all thoughts of sleep\nbanished.\n\n\"And you waited all this time to tell me a thing as important as that?\"\nhe demanded incredulously and almost angrily.\n\n\"Sorry, dad, I just happened to feel your life was more important at\nthe moment, because the other could wait for a....\"\n\n\"OK, OK, I'll buy that for now. But we'll have to make other\narrangements immediately. We'll have to find out where it came from\nand whether this other oligarchy or federation or whatever it is, is a\nmenace to us.\"\n\n\"I don't think it is,\" Hanlon said slowly. \"The being's mind was\nvery peculiar, but it appeared to be extremely logical in its\nthoughts. It said that since it had lost and we have won here, it was\nwithdrawing--and I don't believe it meant temporarily, either. I think\nit meant it was all through here and....\"\n\n\"Don't be silly or childish, son,\" the admiral was intense and\nforceful. \"That one being may have felt that way, but his bosses\nwon't. With two groups of planets so near in space--both with means of\nspace travel--there's bound to be war of some sort, whether actual,\nideological or economic remains to be seen. We'll have to hunt them up,\nand find out what it's all about--and immediately.\"\n\nHanlon shook his head. \"I'll acknowledge your greater experience, dad,\nbut I still have a feeling you're wrong about this. I believe that\nother race is entirely different in their way of thinking to ours--that\nthey are coldly logical and not the type to keep on fighting for\nsomething they've already lost. But, of course,\" he shrugged, \"it's up\nto the High Command to decide. I'd still like to get on with that other\nresearch.\"\n\n\"I'll put both problems up to the Board,\" Newton said. \"But I bet I\nknow how they'll decide. There's the fact that those beings can read\nand control all our minds--except yours. It looks like your job,\nson--yours and no one else's ... although we'll all be behind you in\nevery way we can, of course. Meanwhile,\" stretching out on the couch\nagain, \"until Amir and his advisors want us, I think we'd both better\ntake a nap.\"\n\n\"I am kinda pooped, at that,\" Hanlon said, and sprawled out in his\nchair.\n\nThe admiral was soon asleep, but only Hanlon's body and part of his\nmind relaxed. The balance of his mind was inside his father's body\nagain, speeding the healing of that shoulder burn.\n\nFinally Inver came to call the three Terrans into the Council Chamber.\nHis broadly smiling face, and the thoughts Hanlon read from the surface\nof his mind, told him the decision had been favorable--a fact he\nsignalled to the others at once.\n\n\"We are completely convinced now,\" Elus Amir told them when the Terrans\nwere seated about the conference table, \"that our world will be best\nserved by joining your Federation as we were asked to do. If you have\nthe treaty papers at hand, I will gladly sign them. And my son,\"\nlooking proudly at young Inver, \"will sign with me as the next Ruler of\nSzstruyyah.\"\n\n\"We do not have the proper documents,\" Admiral Newton said. \"But our\nship will be here tomorrow night, and it has long-range communicators\nwith which I will immediately get in touch with the Federation Council,\nwho will send accredited ambassadors here at once. They should be here\nwithin five days.\"\n\n\"Now that we have made up our minds, we are anxious to affiliate with\nthe other worlds. We feel it is a tremendous honor, being the first\nnon-Terran race asked to join them.\"\n\n\"As it is an honor for us to have such a high-principled peoples joined\nto us,\" Admiral Newton said with a courtly bow. \"May I suggest, k'nyer\nand nyers, that when our ambassadors arrive, you ask them for whatever\nhelp you desire in the way of teachers, goods or materials. They will\ngladly explain what we have to offer, and I know they will study you\nand your people to find the things they will ask for in exchange.\nRemember always, please, that it is our steadfast policy to teach only\nwhat you really want to know, and which you specifically ask for, not\nwhat we might 'think you ought to know'.\"\n\n\"That one thing alone,\" Elus Amir said, deeply moved as were the\nmembers of his Council, \"would be enough to confirm us in our belief\nthat we will be doing the right thing for our people in joining you.\"\n\nAmir, his son and the councillors, rose and bowed. The three Terrans\nhad also risen, and saluted punctiliously. Then Newton stepped forward\nimpulsively and held out his hand, which Amir grasped as though he had\nalways used the gesture.\n\n\"Welcome to the Federation of Planets, sire,\" Newton's voice was filled\nwith emotion.\n\nThe Ruler silently wrung his hand.\n\nWhen it was time for the Corpsmen to leave, after some general\nconversation between them all, the Ruler and his son were again profuse\nin their gratitude for what the men had done, personally, to save\nAmir's life, and the peace of their world.\n\nThey escorted the three downstairs and out to Newton's tricycle, and\nstood at Estrellan salute as the Terrans got into their machine.\n\n\"Oh, one thing, Lona,\" the Ruler came forward just as Hanlon was\ngetting in. Amir's eyes were filled with puzzled wonderment. \"How did\nyou know Adwal Irad was coming to attack me while I was asleep, locked\nin my room?\"\n\nHanlon's eyes danced, but he kept his face straight. \"We have a saying\non Terra, k'nyer, that explains it--'a little bird told me'.\"\n\nAnd he bowed again as he entered the machine, and Admiral Newton drove\naway, leaving behind a more than ever puzzled Ruler of the soon-to-be\nnewest member of the Federation of Planets.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Alien Minds, by E.

It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\nlocations.

Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
