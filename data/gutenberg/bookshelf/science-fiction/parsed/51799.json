Johnny McCord emptied\nhis pipe into the wastebasket, came to his feet and strolled toward the\nopen door. He automatically took up a sun helmet before emerging into\nthe Saharan sun.\n\nHe was dressed in khaki shorts and short-sleeved shirt, wool socks and\nyellow Moroccan babouche slippers.\n\nThe slippers were strictly out of uniform and would have been frowned\nupon by Johnny's immediate superiors. However, the Arabs had been\nmaking footwear suitable for sandy terrain for centuries before there\nhad ever been a Sahara Reforestation Commission. Johnny was in favor\nof taking advantage of their know-how. Especially since the top brass\nmade a point of staying in the swank air-conditioned buildings of\nColomb-Bechar, Tamanrasset and Timbuktu, from whence they issued\nlengthy bulletins on the necessity of never allowing a Malian to see\na Commission employee in less than the correct dress and in less than\ncommanding dignity. While they were busily at work composing such\ndirectives, field men such as Johnny McCord went about the Commission's\nreal tasks.\n\nIt was auto-copter 4, which Johnny hadn't expected for another half\nhour. He extracted the reports and then peered into the cockpit to\ncheck. There were two red lights flickering on the panel. Work for\nReuben. This damned sand was a perpetual hazard to equipment. Number 4\nhad just had an overhaul a few weeks before and here it was throwing\nred lights already.\n\nHe took the reports back into the office and dumped them into the\ncard-punch. While they were being set up, Johnny went over to the\noffice refrigerator and got out a can of Tuborg beer. Theoretically, it\nwas as taboo to drink iced beer in this climate, and particularly at\nthis time of day, as it was to go out into the sun without a hat. But\nthis was one place where the Commission's medics could go blow.\n\nBy the time he'd finished the Danish brew, the card-punch had stopped\nclattering so he took the cards from the hopper and crossed to the\nsorter. He gave them a quick joggling--cards held up well in this dry\nclimate, though they were a terror further south--and sorted them\nthrough four code numbers, enough for this small an amount. He carried\nthem over to the collator and merged them into the proper file.\n\nHe was still running off a report on the Alphabetyper when Derek Mason\ncame in.\n\nJohnny drawled in a horrible caricature of a New England accent, \"I\nsay, Si, did the cyclone hurt your barn any?\"\n\nDerek's voice took on the same twang. \"Don't know, Hiram, we ain't\nfound it yet.\"\n\nJohnny said, \"You get all your chores done, Si?\"\n\nDerek dropped the pseudo-twang and his voice expressed disgust. \"I got\na chore for you Johnny, that you're going to love. Rounding up some\nlivestock.\"\n\nJohnny looked up from the report he was running off and shot an\nimpatient glance at him. \"Livestock? What the hell are you talking\nabout?\"\n\n\"Goats.\"\n\nJohnny McCord flicked the stop button on the Alphabetyper. \"Where've\nyou been? There isn't a goat within five hundred miles of here.\"\n\nDerek went over to the refrigerator for beer. He said over his\nshoulder, \"I was just making a routine patrol over toward Am\u00e9rene\nEl Kasbach. I'd estimate there were a hundred Tuareg in camp there.\nCamels, a few sheep, a few horses and donkeys. Mostly goats. Thousands\nof them. By the looks of the transplants, they've been there possibly\na week or so.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJohnny said in agony, \"Oh, Lord. What clan were they?\"\n\nDerek punched a hole in his beer can with the opener that hung from the\nrefrigerator by a string. \"I didn't go low enough to check. You can\nnever tell with a Tuareg. They can't resist as beautiful a target as a\nhelicopter, and one of these days one of them is going to make a hole\nin me, instead of in the fuselage or rotors.\"\n\nJohnny McCord, furious, plunked himself down before the telephone and\ndialed Tessalit, 275 kilometers to the south. The girl on the desk\nthere grinned at him and said, \"Hello, Johnny.\"\n\nJohnny McCord was in no mood for pleasantries. He snapped, \"Who's\nsupposed to be on Bedouin patrol down there?\"\n\nShe blinked at him. \"Why, Mohammed is in command of patrolling this\narea, Mr. McCord.\"\n\n\"Mohammed? Mohammed who? Eighty percent of these Malians are named\nMohammed.\"\n\n\"Captain Mohammed Mohmoud ould Cheikh.\" She added, unnecessarily, \"The\nCadi's son.\"\n\nJohnny grunted. He'd always suspected that the captain had got his\nideas of what a cadi's son should be like from seeing Hollywood movies.\n\"Look, Kate,\" he said. \"Let me talk to Mellor, will you?\"\n\nHer face faded to be replaced by that of a highly tanned,\nmiddle-aged executive type. He scowled at Johnny McCord with a\nthis-better-be-important expression, not helping Johnny's disposition.\n\nHe snapped, \"Somebody's let several thousand goats into my eucalyptus\ntransplants in my western four hundred.\"\n\nMellor was taken aback.\n\nJohnny said, \"I can have Derek back-trail them, if you want to be sure,\nbut it's almost positive they came from the south, this time of year.\"\n\nMellor sputtered, \"They might have come from the direction of\nTimmissao. Who are they, anyway?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Tuareg. I thought we'd supposedly settled with all the\nTuareg. Good Lord, man, do you know how many transplants a thousand\ngoats can go through in a week's time?\"\n\n\"A week's time!\" Mellor rasped. \"You mean you've taken a whole week to\ndetect them?\"\n\nJohnny McCord glared at him. \"A _whole_ week! We're lucky they didn't\nspend the whole _season_ before we found them. How big a staff do you\nthink we have here, Mellor? There's just three of us. Only one can be\nspared for patrol.\"\n\n\"You have natives,\" the older man growled.\n\n\"They can't fly helicopters. Most of them can't even drive a Land Rover\nor a jeep. Besides that, they're scared to death of Tuaregs. They\nwouldn't dare report them. What I want to know is, why didn't you stop\nthem coming through?\"\n\nMellor was on the defensive. He ranked Johnny McCord, but that was\nbeside the point right now. He said finally, \"I'll check this all the\nway through, McCord. Meanwhile, I'll send young Mohammed Mohmoud up\nwith a group of his men.\"\n\n\"To do what?\" Johnny demanded.\n\n\"To shoot the goats, what else?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJohnny growled, \"One of these days a bunch of these Tuareg are going to\ndecide that a lynching bee is in order, and that's going to be the end\nof this little base at Bidon Cinq.\"\n\nMellor said, \"If they're Tuareg nomads then they have no legal right\nto be within several hundred miles of Bidon Cinq. And if they've got\ngoats, they shouldn't have. The Commission has bought up every goat in\nthis part of the world.\"\n\nJohnny growled, \"Sure, bought them up and then left it to the honor of\nthe Tuareg to destroy them. The honor of the Tuareg! Ha!\"\n\nThe other said pompously, \"Are you criticizing the upper echelons,\nMcCord?\"\n\nJohnny McCord snapped, \"You're damned right I am.\" He slammed off the\ntelephone and turned on Derek Mason. \"What are you grinning about?\"\n\nDerek drawled, \"I say, Hiram, I got a sneaky suspicion you ain't never\ngonna graduate off'n this here farm if you don't learn how to cotton up\nto the city slickers better.\"\n\n\"Oh, shut up,\" Johnny growled. \"Let's have another beer.\"\n\nBefore Derek could bring it to him, the telephone screen lit up again\nand Paul Peterson, of the Poste Weygand base, was there. He said, \"Hi.\nYou guys look like you're having a crisis.\"\n\n\"Hello, Paul,\" Johnny McCord said. \"Crisis is right. Those jerks down\nsouth let a clan of Tuareg, complete with a few thousand goats, camels\nand sheep through. They've been grazing a week or more in my west four\nhundred.\"\n\n\"Good grief.\" Paul grimaced. \"At least that's one thing we don't have\nto worry about. They never get this far up. How'd it happen?\"\n\n\"I don't know, but I'm going to find out. I haven't seen the mess yet,\nbut it's certain to wreck that whole four hundred. Have you ever seen\njust one goat at work on the bark of three-year transplants?\"\n\nPaul shuddered sympathetically. \"Look, Johnny,\" he said. \"The reason I\ncalled you. There's an air-cushion Land Rover coming through. She just\nleft.\"\n\nDerek Mason looked over Johnny's shoulder into the screen. \"What d'ya\nmean, _she_?\"\n\nPaul grinned. \"Just that, and, Buster, she's stacked. A Mademoiselle\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne Desage of _Paris Match_.\"\n\nJohnny said, \"The French magazine? What's she doing in a road car? Why\ndoesn't she have an aircraft? There hasn't been a road car through here\nthis whole year.\"\n\nPaul shrugged. \"She claims she's getting it from the viewpoint of how\nthings must've been twenty years ago. So, anyway, we've notified you.\nIf she doesn't turn up in eight or ten hours, you better send somebody\nto look for her.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Johnny McCord said. \"Well, so long, Paul.\"\n\nThe other's face faded from the screen and Johnny McCord turned to his\ncolleague. \"One more extraneous something to foul up our schedule.\"\n\nDerek said mildly, \"I say, Hiram, what're you complaining about? Didn't\nyou hear tell what Paul just said? She's stacked. Be just like a\ntraveling saleswoman visitin' the farm.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Johnny growled. \"And I can see just how much work I'll be\ngetting out of you as long as she's here.\"\n\n\nII\n\nPoste Maurice Cortier, better known in the Sahara as Bidon Cinq, is as\nremote a spot on earth in which man has ever lived. Some 750 kilometers\nto the south is Bourem on the Niger river. If you go west of Bourem\nanother 363 kilometers, you reach Timbuktu, the nearest thing to a\ncity in that part of the Sudan. If you travel north from Bidon Cinq\n1,229 kilometers you reach Colomb-B\u00e9char, the nearest thing to a city\nin southern Algeria. There are no railroads, no highways. The track\nthrough the desert is marked by oil drums filled with gravel so the\nwind won't blow them away. There is an oil drum every quarter of a mile\nor so. You go from one to the next, carrying your own fuel and water.\nIf you get lost, the authorities come looking for you in aircraft.\nSometimes they find you.\n\nIn the latter decades of the Twentieth Century, Bidon Cinq became\nan outpost of the Sahara Reforestation Commission which was working\nnorth from the Niger, and south from Algeria as well as east from\nthe Atlantic. The water table in the vicinity of Bidon Cinq was\nconsiderably higher than had once been thought. Even artesian wells\nwere possible in some localities. More practical still were springs and\nwells exploited by the new solar-powered pumps that in their tens of\nthousands were driving back the sands of the world's largest desert.\n\nJohnny McCord and Derek Mason ate in the officer's mess, divorced from\nthe forty or fifty Arabs and Songhai who composed their work force. It\nwasn't snobbery, simply a matter of being able to eat in leisure and\ndiscuss the day's activities free of the chatter of the larger mess\nhall.\n\nDerek looked down into his plate. \"Hiram,\" he drawled, \"who ever\ninvented this here _cous cous_?\"\n\nJohnny looked over at the tall, easy-going Canadian who was his second\nin command and scowled dourly. He was in no humor for their usual\nbanter. \"What's the matter with _cous cous_?\" Johnny growled.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Derek said. \"I'm a meat and potatoes man at heart.\"\n\nJohnny shrugged. \"_Cous cous_ serves the same purpose as potatoes do.\nOr rice, or spaghetti, or bread, or any of the other bland basic\nfoods. It's what you put on it that counts.\"\n\nDerek stared gloomily into his dish. \"Well, I wish they'd get something\nmore interesting than ten-year-old mutton to put on this.\"\n\nJohnny said, \"Where in the devil is Pierre? It's nearly dark.\"\n\n\"Reuben?\" Derek drawled. \"Why Reuben went out to check the crops up in\nthe northeast forty. Took the horse and buggy.\"\n\nThat didn't help Johnny's irritation. \"He took an air-cushion jeep,\ninstead of a copter? Why, for heaven's sake?\"\n\n\"He wanted to check quite a few of the pumps. Said landing and taking\noff was more trouble than the extra speed helped. He'll be back\nshortly.\"\n\n\"He's back now,\" a voice from the door said.\n\nPierre Marimbert, brushing sand from his clothes, pushed into the room\nand made his way to the mess-hall refrigerator. He said nothing further\nuntil he had a can of beer open.\n\nJohnny said, \"Damn it, Pierre, you shouldn't stay out this late in a\njeep. If you got stuck out there, we'd have one hell of a time finding\nyou. In a copter you've at least got the radio.\"\n\nPierre had washed the dust from his throat. Now he said quietly, \"I\nwanted to check on as many pumps as I could.\"\n\n\"You could have gone back tomorrow. The things are supposed to be\nself-sufficient, no checking necessary more than once every three\nmonths. There's practically nothing that can go wrong with them.\"\n\nPierre finished off the can of beer, reached into the refrigerator for\nanother. \"Dynamite can go wrong with them,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe other two looked at him, shocked silent.\n\nPierre said, \"I don't know how many altogether. I found twenty-two of\nthe pumps in the vicinity of In Ziza had been blown to smithereens--out\nof forty I checked.\"\n\nJohnny rapped, \"How long ago? How many trees...?\"\n\nPierre laughed sourly. \"I don't know how long ago. The transplants,\nespecially the slash pine, are going to be just so much kindling before\nI get new pumps in.\"\n\nDerek said, shocked, \"That's our oldest stand.\"\n\nPierre Marimbert, a forty-year-old, sun-beaten Algerian _colon_, eldest\nman on the team, sank into his place at the table. He poured the\nbalance of his can of beer into a glass.\n\nJohnny said, \"What ... what can we do? How many spare pumps can you get\ninto there, and how soon?\"\n\nPierre looked up at him wearily. \"You didn't quite hear what I said,\nJohnny. I only checked forty. Forty out of nearly a thousand in that\nvicinity. Twenty-two of them were destroyed, better than fifty percent.\nFor all I know, that percentage applies throughout the whole In Ziza\narea. If so, there's damn few of your trees going to be left alive.\nWe have a few spare pumps on hand here, but we'd have to get a really\nlarge number all the way from Dakar.\"\n\nDerek said softly, \"That took a lot of men and a lot of dynamite. Which\nmeans a lot of transport--and a lot of money. We've had trouble before,\nbut usually it was disgruntled nomads, getting revenge for losing their\ngrazing land.\"\n\nJohnny snorted, \"Damn little grazing this far north.\"\n\nDerek nodded. \"I'm simply saying that even if we could blame our minor\nsabotage on the Tuareg in the past, we can't do it this time. There's\nmoney behind anything this big.\"\n\nJohnny McCord said wearily, \"Let's eat. In the morning we'll go out and\ntake a look. I'd better call Timbuktu on this. If nothing else, the\nMali Federation can send troops out to protect us.\"\n\nDerek grunted. \"With a standing army of about 25,000 men, they're going\nto patrol a million and a half square miles of desert?\"\n\n\"Can you think of anything else to do?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPierre Marimbert began dishing _cous cous_ into a soup plate, then\npoured himself a glass of _vin ordinaire_. He said, \"I can't think of a\nbetter place for saboteurs. Twenty men could do millions of dollars of\ndestruction and never be found.\"\n\nJohnny growled, \"It's not as bad as all that. They've got to eat and\ndrink, and so do their animals. There are damned few places where they\ncan.\"\n\nFrom the door a voice said, \"I am intruding?\"\n\nThey hadn't heard her car come up. The three men scrambled to their\nfeet.\n\n\"Good evening,\" Johnny McCord blurted.\n\n\"Hell ... o!\" Derek breathed.\n\nPierre Marimbert was across the room, taking her in hand. \"_Bonjour,\nMademoiselle. Que puis-je faire pour vous? Voulez-vous une biere bien\nfraiche ou un ap\u00e9ritif? Il fait tr\u00e9s chaud dans le desert._\" He led her\ntoward the table.\n\n\"Easy, easy there, Reuben,\" Derek grumbled. \"The young lady speaks\nEnglish. Give a man a chance.\"\n\nJohnny was placing a chair for her. \"Paul Peterson, from Poste\nWeygand, radioed that you were coming. You're a little late,\nMademoiselle Desage.\"\n\nShe was perhaps thirty, slim, long-legged, Parisian style. Even at\nBidon Cinq, half a world away from the Champs Elys\u00e9es, she maintained\nher chic.\n\nShe made a moue at Johnny, while taking the chair he held. \"I had hoped\nto surprise you, catch you off guard.\" She took in the sun-dried,\ndour-faced American wood technologist appraisingly, then turned her\neyes in turn to Derek and Pierre.\n\n\"You three are out here all alone?\" she said demurely.\n\n\"Desperately,\" Derek said.\n\nJohnny McCord said, \"Mademoiselle H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Desage, I am John McCord,\nand these are my associates, Monsieur Pierre Marimbert and Mr. Derek\nMason. Gentlemen, Mademoiselle Desage is with _Paris Match_, the French\nequivalent of _Life_, so I understand. In short, she is undoubtedly\nhere for a story. So ixnay on the ump-pays.\"\n\n\"I would love cold beer,\" H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Desage said to Pierre, and to Johnny\nMcCord, \"These days a traveling reporter for _Paris Match_ must be\nquite a linguist. My English, Spanish and Italian are excellent. My\nGerman passable. And while I am not fluent in Pig-Latin, I can follow\nit. What is this you are saying about the pumps?\"\n\n\"Oh, Lord,\" Johnny said. \"Perhaps I'll tell you in the morning. But for\nnow, would you like to clean up before supper? You must be exhausted\nafter that 260 kilometers from Poste Weygand.\"\n\nPierre said hurriedly, \"I'll take Mademoiselle Desage over to one of\nthe guest bungalows.\"\n\n\"Zut!\" she said. \"The sand! It is even worse than between Reggan and\nPoste Weygand. Do you realize that until I began coming across your new\nforests I saw no life at all between these two posts?\"\n\nThe three forestry experts bowed in unison, as though rehearsed.\n\"Mademoiselle,\" Derek, from the heart, \"calling our transplant forests\nis the kindest thing you could have said in these parts.\"\n\nThey all laughed and Pierre led her from the room.\n\nDerek looked at Johnny McCord. \"Wow, that was a slip mentioning the\npumps.\"\n\nJohnny was looking through the door after her. \"I suppose so,\" he\nsaid sourly. \"I'll have to radio the brass and find out the line\nwe're supposed to take with her. That's the biggest magazine in the\nFrench-speaking world and you don't get a job on it without knowing the\njournalistic ropes. That girl can probably smell a story as far as a\nTuareg can smell water.\"\n\n\"Well, then undoubtedly she's already sniffing. Because, between that\nclan of Tuareg with its flocks and the pump saboteurs, we've got more\nstories around here than I ever expected!\"\n\n\nIII\n\nIn the morning H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Desage managed to look the last word in what\ndesert fashion should be, when she strolled into Johnny McCord's\noffice. Although she came complete with a sun helmet that must have\nbeen the product of a top Parisian shop, she would have been more at\nplace on the beaches at Miami, Honolulu or Cannes. Her shorts were\nshort and fitting, her blouse silken, her walking shoes dainty.\n\nHe considered for a moment and then decided against informing her\nthat Moslems, particularly in this part of the world, were little\nused to seeing semi-nude women strolling about. He'd leave the job of\nexplanation to Pierre, as a fellow Frenchman and the oldest man present\nto boot.\n\n\"_Bonjour_,\" she said. \"What a lovely day. I have been strolling about\nyour little oasis. But you have made it a garden!\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Johnny said. \"We've got to have something to do after working\nhours. Entertainment is on the scarce side. But it's more than a\ngarden. We've been experimenting to see just what trees will take to\nthis country--given water and care through the early years. Besides, we\nuse it as a showplace.\"\n\n\"Showplace?\"\n\n\"For skeptical politicians who come through,\" Johnny said, seating her\nin a chair near his desk. \"We give them the idea that the whole Sahara\ncould eventually be like this square mile or so at Bidon Cinq. Palm\ntrees, fruit trees, pines, shade trees. The works.\"\n\n\"And could it?\"\n\nJohnny grinned sourly. \"Well, not exactly. Not all in one spot, at\nleast. You've got to remember, the Sahara covers an area of some\nthree and a half million square miles. In that area you find almost\neverything.\"\n\n\"Everything except water, eh?\" She was tapping a cigarette on a\npolish-reddened thumbnail. As he lit it for her, Johnny McCord realized\nthat he hadn't seen fingernail polish for a year. He decided it was too\nlong.\n\n\"Even water, in some parts,\" he said. \"There's more water than most\npeople realize. For instance, the Niger, which runs right through a\nconsiderable part of the Sahara, is the eleventh largest river in the\nworld. But until our commission went to work on it, it dumped itself\ninto the Gulf of Guinea, unused.\"\n\n\"The Niger is a long way from here,\" she said through her smoke.\n\nHe nodded. \"For that matter, though, we have a certain amount of rain,\nparticularly in the highland regions of the central massif. In the\npast, with no watershed at all, it ran off, buried itself in the sands,\nor evaporated.\"\n\n\"Mr. McCord,\" she said, \"you are amazingly optimistic. Formerly, I must\nadmit I had little knowledge of the Sahara Reforestation Commission.\nAnd I deliberately avoided studying up on the subject after receiving\nthis assignment, because I wanted first impression to be received on\nthe spot. However, I've just driven across the Sahara. My impression\nis that your Commission is one great--_Comment dit-on?_--boon-doggling\nproject, a super-W.P.A. into which to plow your American resources and\nmanpower. It is a fake, a delusion. This part of the world has never\nbeen anything but wasteland, and never will be.\"\n\nJohnny McCord heard her out without change in expression.\n\nHe'd been through this before. In fact, almost every time a junketing\ncongressman came through. There was danger in the viewpoint, of course.\nIf the fantastic sums of money which were being spent were cut off,\nsuch pessimistic views would become automatically correct.\n\nHe took the paperweight from a stack of the correspondence on his desk\nand handed it to her.\n\nShe looked at it and scowled--very prettily, but still a scowl. \"What\nis this? It's a beautiful piece of stone.\"\n\n\"I picked it up myself,\" Johnny said. \"Near Reggan. It's a chunk of\npetrified wood, Miss Desage. From a tree that must have originally had\na diameter of some ten feet. Not quite a redwood, of course, but big.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, turning it over in her hand. \"I can see this part,\nwhich must have once been bark. But why do you show it to me?\"\n\n\"The Sahara was once a semi-tropical, moist area, highly wooded. It can\nbecome so again.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe put the piece of fossil back on his desk. \"How long ago?\" she said\nbluntly.\n\n\"A very long time ago, admittedly. During the last Ice Age and\nimmediately afterwards. But, given man's direction, it can be done\nagain. And it must be.\"\n\nShe raised pencilled eyebrows at him. \"Must be?\"\n\nJohnny McCord shifted in his chair. \"You must be aware of the world's\npopulation explosion, Miss Desage. The human race can't allow three\nand a half million square miles of land to be valueless.\" He grunted\nin deprecation. \"And at the rate it was going, it would have been four\nmillion before long.\"\n\nShe didn't understand.\n\nJohnny spelled it out for her. \"A desert can be man-made. Have you\never been in the Middle East?\" At her nod, he went on. \"Visitors there\nusually wonder how in the world the ancient Jews could ever have\nthought of that area as a land of milk and honey. On the face of it,\nit's nothing but badlands. What was once the Fertile Crescent now looks\nlike Arizona.\"\n\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne Desage was frowning at him. \"And you suggest man did this--not\nnature?\"\n\n\"The goat did it. The goat, and the use of charcoal as fuel. Along\nwith ignorance of soil erosion and the destruction of the wonderful\nwatershed based on the Cedars of Lebanon. Same thing applies to large\nareas of Libya and Tunisia, and to Morocco and Spain. Those countries\nused to be some of the richest agricultural areas of the Roman Empire.\nBut you can't graze goats, probably the most destructive animal\ndomesticated, and you can't depend on charcoal for fuel, unless you\nwant to create desert.\"\n\n\"Those things happened a long time ago.\"\n\nJohnny snorted. \"When we first began operations, the Sahara was going\nsouth at the rate of two miles a year. Goats prefer twigs and bark even\nto grass. They strip a country.\"\n\n\"Well,\" the reporter said, shrugging shapely shoulders, \"at any rate,\nthe task is one of such magnitude as to be fantastic. Yesterday, I\ndrove for nearly eight hours without seeing even a clump of cactus.\"\n\n\"The route you traveled is comparatively untouched by our efforts, thus\nfar,\" Johnny nodded agreeably. \"However, we're slowly coming down from\nAlgeria, up from the Niger, and, using the new chemical methods of\nfreshening sea water, east from Mauretania.\"\n\nHe came to his feet and pointed out spots on the large wall map. \"Our\nterritory, of course, is only this area which once was called French\nWest Africa, plus Algeria. The battle is being fought elsewhere by\nothers. The Egyptians and Sudanese are doing a fairly good job in their\ncountry, with Soviet Complex help. The Tunisians are doing a wonderful\njob with the assistance of Common Europe, especially Italy.\"\n\nShe stood beside him and tried to understand. \"What is this area, here,\nshaded green?\"\n\nHe said proudly, \"That's how far we've got so far, heading north from\nthe Niger. In the past, the desert actually came down to the side of\nthe river in many places. The water was completely wasted. Now we've\ndiverted it and are reforesting anywhere up to three miles a year.\"\n\n\"Three miles a year,\" she scoffed. \"You'll take five centuries.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe shook his head and grinned. \"It's a progressive thing. Water is\nadmittedly the big problem. But as our forests grow, they themselves\nbring up the moisture content of the climate. Down in this area--\" he\nmade a sweeping gesture over the map which took in large sections north\nof the Niger--\"we've put in hundreds of millions of slash pine, which\nis particularly good for sandy soil and fast growing. In ten years\nyou've gone from two-year-old seedlings to a respectable forest.\"\n\nJohnny pointed out Bidon Cinq on the map. \"At the same time we found\nwhat amounts to a subterranean sea in this area. Not a real sea, of\ncourse, but a water-bearing formation or aquifer, deep down under\nthe surface of the earth--layers of rock and gravel in which large\nquantities of water are lying. The hydro-geological technicians who\nsurveyed it estimate that it holds reserves of several billion tons\nof water. Utilizing it, we've put in several hundred square miles\nof seedlings and transplants of various varieties. Where there are\nnatural oases, of course, we stress a lot of date palm. In rocky areas\nit's _acacia tortila_. In the mountains we sometimes use varieties\nof the pinyon--they'll take quite a beating but are a little on the\nslow-growing side.\"\n\nShe was looking at him from the sides of her eyes. \"You're all taken up\nby this, aren't you Mr. McCord?\"\n\nJohnny said, surprise in his voice. \"Why, it's my work.\"\n\nDerek came sauntering in and scaled his sun helmet onto his own desk.\n\"Good morning, Mademoiselle,\" he said. And to Johnny, \"Hiram, that city\nslicker from Timbuktu just came up with his posse.\"\n\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne said, \"What is this _Si_, _Hiram_ and _Reuben_ which you call\neach other?\"\n\nJohnny smiled sourly, \"In a way, Miss Desage, this is just one great\ntree farm. And all of us are farmers. So we make jokes about it.\"\nHe thought for a moment. \"Derek, possibly you better take over with\nMohammed. I want to get over to In Ziza with Reuben.\"\n\n\"To see about the pumps?\" H\u00e9l\u00e8ne said innocently.\n\nJohnny frowned but was saved from an answer by the entrance of Mohammed\nMohmoud. He was dark as a Saharan becomes dark, his original Berber\nblood to be seen only in his facial characteristics. He wore the rather\nflamboyant Mali Federation desert uniform with an air.\n\nWhen he saw the girl, his eyebrows rose and he made the Moslem salaam\nwith a sweeping flourish.\n\nJohnny said, \"Mademoiselle Desage, may I present Captain Mohammed\nMohmoud ould Cheikh, of the Mali desert patrol.\" He added sourly, \"The\nofficer in charge of preventing nomads from filtering up from the south\ninto our infant forests.\"\n\nThe Moslem scowled at him. \"They could have come from the east,\nfrom Timmissao,\" he said in quite passable English. \"Or even from\nMauritania.\" He turned his eyes to H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Desage. \"_Enchant\u00e9,\nMademoiselle. Tr\u00e9s heureux de faire ta connaissance._\"\n\nShe gave him the full benefit of her eyes. \"_Moi aussi, Monsieur._\"\n\nJohnny wasn't through with the Malian officer. \"There's a hundred of\nthem,\" he snapped, \"with several thousand head of goats and other\nlivestock. It would have been impossible to push that number across\nfrom Mauritania or even from the east, and you know it.\"\n\nA lighter complexion would have shown a flush. Mohammed Mohmoud's\ndispleasure was limited in expression to a flashing of desert eyes. He\nsaid, \"Wherever their origin, the task would seem to be immediately to\ndestroy the animals. That is why my men and I are here.\"\n\nPierre Marimbert had entered while the conversation was going on. He\nsaid, \"Johnny, weren't you going over to In Ziza with me?\"\n\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne Desage said, the tip of her right forefinger to her chin as she\nportrayed thought, \"I can't decide where to go. To this crisis of the\nTuareg, or to the crisis of the pumps--whatever that is.\"\n\nJohnny said flatly, \"Sorry, but you'd just be in the way at either\nplace.\"\n\nMohammed Mohmoud was shrugging. \"Why not let her come with me? I can\nguarantee her protection. I have brought fifty men with me, more than a\nmatch for a few bedouin.\"\n\n\"Gracious,\" she said. \"Evidently I was unaware of the magnitude of this\nmatter. I absolutely _must_ go.\"\n\nJohnny said, \"No.\"\n\nShe looked at him appraisingly. \"Mr. McCord,\" she said, \"I am here\nfor a story. Has it occurred to you that preventing a _Paris Match_\nreporter from seeing your methods of operation is probably a bigger\nstory than anything else I could find here?\" She struck a mock pose.\n\"I can see the headlines. _Sahara Reforestation Authorities Prevent\nJournalists from Observing Operations_.\"\n\n\"Oh, Good Lord,\" Johnny growled. \"This should happen to me, yet! Go on\nwith Derek and the captain, if you wish.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPierre Marimbert and Johnny McCord took one of the faster helicopters,\nPierre piloting. With French \u00e9lan he immediately raised the craft a\nfew feet and then like a nervous horse it backed up, wheeled about and\ndashed forward in full flight.\n\nSpread below them were the several dozen buildings which comprised\nBidon Cinq; surrounding the buildings, the acres of palm and pine,\neucalyptus and black locust. Quick-growing, dry-climate trees\npredominated, but there were even such as balsam fir, chestnut and elm.\nIt made an attractive sight from the air.\n\nThe reforestation projects based on Bidon Cinq were not all in the\nimmediate vicinity of the home oasis. By air, In Ziza was almost 125\nkilometers to the northeast. By far the greater part of the land\nlying in between was still lacking in vegetation of any sort. The\nhydro-geological engineers who had originally surveyed the area for\nwater had selected only the best sections for immediate sinking of\nwells, placement of solar power pumps, and eventually the importation\nof two-year seedlings and three- and four-year-old transplants. The\nheavy auto-planters, brought in by air transport, had ground their way\nacross the desert sands in their hundreds, six feet between machines.\nStop, dig the hole, set the seedling, splash in water, artfully tamp\ndown the soil, move on another six feet, stop--and begin the operation\nall over again. Fifty trees an hour, per machine.\n\nIn less than two months, the planters had moved on to a new base\nfurther north. The mob of scientists, engineers, water and forest\ntechnicians, mechanics and laborers melted away, leaving Johnny McCord,\nhis two assistants, his half dozen punch-card machines, his automated\nequipment and his forty or fifty native workers. It was one of a\nhundred such centers. It would eventually be one of thousands. The\nSahara covered an area almost the size of Europe.\n\nJohnny McCord growled, \"Friend Mohammed seems quite taken with our\nreporter.\"\n\nPierre grinned and tried to imitate a New England twang. \"Why not,\nHiram? She's the first, eh, women folks seen in these parts for many\na day.\" He looked down at the endless stretches of sand dunes, gravel\nand rock out-croppings. \"Mighty dry farm land you've got around here,\nHiram.\"\n\nJohnny McCord grunted. \"Derek said the other day it's so dry even the\nmirages are only mud holes.\" He pointed with his forefinger. \"There's\nthe first of our trees. Now, what pumps did you check?\"\n\nPierre directed the copter lower, skimmed not much higher than the\nyoung tree tops. Some of them had already reached an impressive height.\nBut Johnny McCord realized that the time was not too distant when\nthey'd have to replant. Casualties were considerably higher than in\nforest planting at home. Considerably so. And replanting wasn't nearly\nso highly automated as the original work. More manpower was required.\n\n\"These pumps here seem all right,\" he said to Pierre.\n\n\"A little further north,\" Pierre said. \"I came in over the track there,\nfrom the road that comes off the main route to Poste Weygand. Yes,\nthere we are. Look! Completely destroyed.\"\n\nJohnny swore. The trees that had depended on that particular pump\nwouldn't last a month, in spite of the fact that they were among the\nfirst set in this area.\n\nHe said, \"Go higher. We should be able to spot the complete damage with\nglasses. You saw twenty-two, you say?\"\n\n\"Yes, I don't know how many more there might be.\"\n\nThere were twenty-five destroyed pumps in all. And all of them were\npractically together.\n\nIt was sheer luck that Pierre Marimbert had located them so soon. Had\nhis routine check taken place in some other section of the vast tree\ndevelopment, he would have found nothing untoward.\n\n\"This isn't nearly so bad as I had expected,\" Johnny growled. He was\nscowling thoughtfully.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" Pierre said.\n\n\"I just don't get it,\" Johnny said. \"Number one, nomads don't carry\ndynamite, unless it's been deliberately given them. Two, if it\nwas given them by someone with a purpose, why only enough to blow\ntwenty-five pumps? That isn't a drop in the bucket. A few thousand\ntrees are all we'll lose. Three, where did they come from? Where are\ntheir tracks? And where have they gone? This job wasn't done so very\nlong ago, probably within a week or two at most.\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\"\n\n\"Otherwise those trees affected would already be dying. At their age,\nthey couldn't stand the sun long without water.\"\n\nPierre said, his face registering disbelief, \"Do you think it could be\nsimple vandalism on the part of a small band of Tuareg?\"\n\n\"Sure, if the pumps had been destroyed by hand. But with explosives?\nEven if your band of Tuareg did have explosives they wouldn't waste\nthem on a few Sahara Reforestation Commission pumps.\"\n\n\"This whole thing just doesn't make sense,\" Pierre Marimbert decided.\n\n\"Let's land and take a look at one of those pumps,\" Johnny said. \"You\nknow, if you get the whole crew to work on this you might be able\nto replace them before we lose any of these transplants. It's all\naccording to how long ago they were destroyed.\"\n\n\nIV\n\nBack at Bidon Cinq again that afternoon, Johnny McCord was greeted by\nthe native office assistant he'd left in charge while all three of the\nofficers were gone. Mellor, at the Tissalit base, had made several\nattempts to get in touch with him.\n\n\"Mellor!\" Pierre grunted. \"How do you Americans say it? Stuffed shirt!\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Johnny McCord said, sitting down to the telephone. \"But my\nboss.\"\n\nWhile Pierre was fishing two cans of beer from the refrigerator, Johnny\ndialed Tissalit. Kate's face lit up the screen. Johnny said, \"Hi. I\nunderstand the old man wants to talk to me.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" the girl said, and moved a switch. \"Just a minute,\nJohnny.\"\n\nHer face faded to be replaced by that of Mellor. Johnny noted that as\nusual the other wore a business suit, complete with white shirt and\ntie--in the middle of the Sahara!\n\nMellor was scowling. \"Where've you been, McCord?\"\n\n\"Checking some pumps near In Ziza,\" Johnny said evenly.\n\n\"Leaving no one at all at camp?\" the other said.\n\nJohnny said, \"There were at least a score of men here, Mr. Mellor.\"\n\n\"No officers. Suppose an emergency came up?\"\n\nJohnny felt like saying, _An emergency did come up, two of them in\nfact. That's why we were all gone at once._ But for some reason he\ndecided against explaining current happenings at Bidon Cinq until he\nhad a clearer picture. He said, \"There are only three of us here, Mr.\nMellor. We have to stretch our manpower. Derek Mason had to go over to\nAm\u00e9rene el Kasbach with Mohammed Mohmoud and his men to clear out those\nnomads and their livestock.\"\n\n\"What did they find? Where were the Tuareg from?\"\n\n\"They haven't returned yet.\" Automatically, Johnny took up his can of\nbeer and took a swallow from it.\n\nMellor's eyebrows went up. \"Drinking this early in the day, McCord?\"\n\nJohnny sighed deeply, \"Look, Mr. Mellor, Pierre Marimbert and I just\nreturned from several hours in the desert, inspecting pumps. We're\ndehydrated, so we're drinking cold beer. It tastes wonderful. I doubt\nif it will lead either of us to a drunkard's grave.\"\n\nMellor scowled pompously. He said finally, \"See here, McCord--the\nreason I called--you can be expecting a reporter from one of the French\npublications--\"\n\n\"She's here.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Mellor said. \"I just received notice this morning. Orders are to\ngive her the utmost cooperation. Things are on the touchy side right\nnow. Very touchy.\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\" Johnny said.\n\n\"There are pressures on the highest levels,\" Mellor said, managing to\nput over the impression that these matters were above and beyond such\nas Johnny McCord but that he, Mellor, was privy to them.\n\n\"What pressures?\" Johnny said wearily. \"If you want me to handle this\nwoman with kid gloves, then I've got to know what I'm protecting her\nagainst, or hiding from her, or whatever the hell I'm supposed to do.\"\n\nMellor glared at him. \"I'm not sure I always appreciate your flippancy,\nMcCord,\" he said. \"However, back home the opposition is in an uproar\nover our expenditures. Things are very delicate. A handful of votes\ncould sway the continuance of the whole project.\"\n\nJohnny McCord closed his eyes in pain. This came up every year or so.\n\nMellor said, \"That isn't all. The Russkies are putting up a howl in the\nReunited Nations. They claim the West plans to eventually take over all\nnorthwest Africa. That this reforestation is just preliminary to make\nthe area worth assimilating.\"\n\nJohnny chuckled sourly, \"Let's face it. They're right.\"\n\nMellor was shocked. \"Mr. McCord! The West has never admitted to any\nsuch scheme.\"\n\nJohnny sighed. \"However, we aren't plowing billions into the Sahara out\nof kindness of heart. The Mali Federation alone has almost two million\nsquare miles in it, and less than twenty million population. Already,\nthere's fewer people than are needed to exploit the new lands we've\nopened up.\"\n\n\"Well, that brings up another point,\" Mellor said. \"The Southeast Asia\nBloc is putting up a howl too. They claim they should be the ones\nallowed to reclaim this area and that it should go into farmland\ninstead of forest.\"\n\n\"They're putting the cart before the horse,\" Johnny said. \"At this\nstage of the game, the only land they could use really profitably for\nfarming would be along the Niger. We're going to have to forest this\nwhole area first, and in doing so, change the whole climate. _Then_\nit'll....\"\n\nMellor interrupted him. \"I'm as familiar with the program of the Sahara\nReforestation Commission as you are, I am sure, McCord. I need no\nlecture. See that Miss Desage gets as sympathetic a picture of our work\nas possible. And, for heaven's sake, don't let anything happen that\nmight influence her toward writing something that would change opinions\neither at home or in the Reunited Nations.\"\n\n\"I'll do my best,\" Johnny said sourly.\n\nThe other clicked off.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPierre was handy with another can of beer, already opened. \"So\nMademoiselle Desage is to be handled with loving care.\"\n\nJohnny groaned, \"And from what we've seen so far of Mademoiselle\nDesage, she's going to take quite a bit of loving care to handle.\"\n\nOutside, they could hear the beating of rotors coming in. Two\nhelicopters, from the sound of it. Beer cans in hand they went over to\nthe window and watched them approach.\n\n\"Derek and the girl in one, Mohammed in the other,\" Pierre said.\n\"Evidently our good captain left the messy work of butchering goats to\nhis men, while he remains on the scene to be as available to our girl\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne as she will allow.\"\n\nThe copters swooped in, landed, the rotors came to a halt and the\noccupants stepped from the cockpits. The Arab ground crew came running\nup to take over.\n\nPreceded by H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Desage, the two men made their way toward the main\noffice. Even at this distance there seemed to be an aggressive lift to\nthe girl's walk.\n\n\"Oh, oh, my friend,\" Pierre said. \"I am afraid Mademoiselle Desage is\nunhappy about something.\"\n\nJohnny groaned. \"I think you're right. But smile, Reuben, smile. You\nheard the city slicker's orders. Handle her with all the care of a\nnew-born heifer.\"\n\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne Desage stormed through the door and glared at Johnny McCord. \"Do\nyou realize what your men are doing?\"\n\n\"I thought I did,\" Johnny said placatingly.\n\nDerek and Mohammed Mohmoud entered behind her. Derek winked at Johnny\nMcCord and made a beeline for the refrigerator. \"Beer, everybody?\" he\nsaid.\n\nMohammed Mohmoud said, \"A soft drink for me, if you please, Mr. Mason.\"\n\nDerek said, \"Sorry, I forgot. Beer, Miss Desage?\"\n\nShe turned and glared at him. \"You did nothing whatsoever to prevent\nthem!\"\n\nDerek shrugged. \"That's why we went out there, honey. Did you notice\nhow much damage those goats had done to the trees? Thousands of dollars\nworth.\"\n\nJohnny said wearily, \"What happened?\" He sank into the chair behind his\ndesk.\n\nThe reporter turned to him again. \"Your men are shooting the livestock\nof those poverty-stricken people.\"\n\nMohammed Mohmoud said, \"We are keeping an accurate count of every beast\ndestroyed, Mr. McCord.\" His dark face was expressionless.\n\nJohnny McCord attempted to explain to the girl. \"As I told you, Miss\nDesage, goats are the curse of the desert. They prefer leaves, twigs\nand even the bark of young trees to grass. The Commission before ever\ntaking on this tremendous project arranged through the Mali Federation\ngovernment to buy up and have destroyed every grazing animal north of\nthe Niger. It cost millions upon millions. But our work couldn't even\nbegin until it was accomplished.\"\n\n\"But why slaughter the livelihood of those poor people? You could quite\neasily insist that they return with their flocks to whatever areas are\nstill available to them.\"\n\nDerek offered her a can of beer. She seemed to be going to reject it,\nbut a desert-born thirst changed her mind. She took it without thanking\nhim.\n\nThe lanky Canadian said mildly, \"I tried to explain to her that the\nTuareg aren't exactly innocent children of the desert. They're known\nas the Apaches of the Sahara. For a couple of thousand years they've\nterrified the other nomads. They were slave raiders, bandits. When the\nCommission started its work the other tribes were glad to sell their\nanimals and take up jobs in the new oases. Send their kids to the\nnew schools we've been building in the towns. Begin fitting into the\nreality of modern life.\"\n\nHer eyes were flashing now. \"The Apaches of the Sahara, eh? _Bien sur!_\nIf I remember correctly, the American Apaches were the last of the\nIndian tribes which you Americans destroyed. The last to resist. Now\nyou export your methods to Africa!\"\n\nJohnny McCord said mildly, \"Miss Desage, it seems to be the thing\nthese days to bleed over the fate of the redman. Actually, there are a\ngreater number of them in the United States today than there were when\nColumbus landed. But even if you do carry a torch for the noble Indian,\npicking the Apaches as an example is poor choice. They were bandit\ntribes, largely living off what they could steal and raid from the\nPueblo and other harder working but less warlike Indians. The Tuareg\nare the North African equivalent.\"\n\n\"Who are you to judge?\" she snapped back. \"Those tribesmen out there\nare the last defenders of their ancient desert culture. Their flocks\nare their way of life. You mercilessly butcher them, rob their women\nand children of their sole source of food and clothing.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJohnny McCord ran his hand over his face in an unhappy gesture. \"Look,\"\nhe said plaintively. \"Those goats and sheep have already been bought\nand paid for by the Commission. The Tuareg should have destroyed\nthem, or sold them as food to be immediately butchered, several years\nago. Where they've been hiding is a mystery. But they simply have no\nright to be in possession of those animals, no right to be in this\npart of the country, and, above all, no right to be grazing in our\ntransplants.\"\n\n\"It's their country! What right have you to order them away?\"\n\nJohnny McCord held up his hands, palms upward. \"This country is part\nof the Mali Federation, Miss Desage. It used to be called French Sudan\nand South Algeria. The government of the Federation gladly accepted the\nproject of reforestating the Sahara. Why not? We've already succeeded\nin making one of the most poverty-stricken areas in the world a\nprosperous one. Far from there being unemployment here, we have a labor\nshortage. Schools have opened, even universities. Hospitals have sprung\nup. Highways have been laid out through country that hadn't even trails\nbefore. The Federation is booming. If there are a few Tuareg who can't\nadapt to the new world, it's too bad. Their children will be glad for\nthe change.\"\n\nShe seated herself stiffly. \"I am not impressed by your excuses,\" she\nsaid.\n\nJohnny shrugged and turned to Mohammed Mohmoud who had been standing\nsilently through all this, almost as though at attention.\n\nJohnny said, \"Did you learn where this band comes from? Where they had\nkept that many animals for so long without detection?\"\n\nThe Moslem officer shook his head. \"They wouldn't reveal that.\"\n\nJohnny looked at Derek Mason. The Canadian shook his head. \"None of\nthem spoke French, Johnny. Or if they did, they wouldn't admit it.\nWhen we first came up they looked as though they were going to fight.\nHappily, the size of the captain's command made them decide otherwise.\nAt any rate, they're putting up no resistance. I let them know through\nthe captain, here, that when they got back to Tissalit, or Timbuktu,\nthey could put in a demand for reimbursement for their animals--if the\nanimals were legally theirs.\"\n\nJohnny looked at the Malian officer again. \"How come you've returned to\ncamp? Shouldn't you be out there with your men?\"\n\n\"There were a few things to be discussed,\" the Moslem said. He looked\nsignificantly at the French reporter.\n\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne Desage said, \"Let me warn you, I will not tolerate being sent\naway. I want to hear this. If I don't, I demand you let me communicate\nimmediately with my magazine and with the Transatlantic Newspaper\nAlliance for whom I am also doing a series of articles on the Sahara\nReforestation _scheme_.\"\n\nJohnny McCord winced. He said, \"There is nothing going on around here,\nMiss Desage, that is secret. You won't be ordered away.\" He turned to\nMohammed Mohmoud. \"What did you wish to discuss, Captain?\"\n\n\"First, what about the camels, asses and horses?\"\n\n\"Shoot them. Practically the only graze between here and Tissalit are\nour trees.\"\n\n\"And how will they get themselves and their property out of this\ncountry?\" the reporter snapped.\n\nJohnny said wearily, \"We'll truck them out, Miss Desage. They and all\ntheir property. And while we're doing it, we'll feed them. I imagine,\nbefore it's all over it will cost the Commission several thousand\ndollars.\" He turned back to the desert patrol captain. \"What else?\"\n\nFrom a tunic pocket Mohammed Mohmoud brought a handgun and handed it to\nJohnny McCord. \"I thought you might like to see this. They were quite\nwell armed. At first I thought there might be resistance.\"\n\nJohnny turned the automatic over in his hands, scowling at it. \"What's\nthere to see that's special? I don't know much about guns.\"\n\nMohammed Mohmoud said, \"It was made in Pilsen.\"\n\nJohnny looked up at him. \"Czechoslovakia, eh?\"\n\nThe other said, \"So were most of their rifles.\"\n\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne Desage snorted in deprecation. \"So, we'll drag in that old\nwheeze. The red menace. Blame it on _la Russie_.\"\n\nJohnny McCord said mildly, \"We haven't blamed anything on the Russkies,\nMiss Desage. The Tuareg have a right to bear arms, there are still\ndangerous animals in the Mali Federation. And they are free to purchase\nCzech weapons if they find them better or cheaper than western ones.\nDon't find an exciting story where there is none. Things are tranquil\nhere.\"\n\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne Desage stared at him. So did Mohammed Mohmoud and Derek Mason\nfor that matter.\n\nOnly Pierre Marimbert realized Johnny McCord's position, and he\nchuckled and went for more beer.\n\n\nV\n\nJohnny McCord was a man who didn't like to be thrown out of routine. He\nresented the interference with his schedule of the past few days. By\nnature he was methodical, not given to inspiration.\n\nAll of which was probably the reason that he spent a sleepless night\ntrying to find rhyme and reason where seemingly there was none.\n\nAt dawn, he stepped from the door of his Quonset hut quarters and\nlooked for a moment into the gigantic red ball which was the Saharan\nsun. Neither dawn nor sunset at Bidon Cinq were spectacular, nor would\nthey become so until the Sahara Reforestation Commission began to\nreturn moisture to desert skies. Johnny wondered if he would live to\nsee it.\n\nHe made his way over to the huge steel shed which doubled as garage and\naircraft hanger. As yet, none of the native mechanics were stirring,\nalthough he could hear sounds of activity in the community kitchen.\n\nDerek Mason looked up from his inspection of H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Desage's\nair-cushion Land Rover.\n\nJohnny McCord scowled at him. \"What in the hell are you doing here?\"\n\nThe lanky Canadian came erect and looked for a long moment at his\nsuperior. He said finally, soberly, \"It occurs to me that I'm probably\ndoing the same thing you came to do.\"\n\n\"What have you found?\"\n\n\"That a small bomb has been attached to the starter.\"\n\nJohnny didn't change expression. It fitted in. \"What else?\" he said.\n\nDerek handed him a steel ring.\n\nJohnny McCord looked at it, recognized it for what it was and stuck it\nin his pocket. \"Let's go back to the office. Yell in to the cook to\nsend some coffee over, and call Pierre. We've got some notes to check.\"\n\nMademoiselle Desage was a late riser. When she entered the office, the\nthree Sahara Reforestation Commission officers were already at work.\n\nShe said snappishly to Johnny McCord, \"Today I would like to see these\ndestroyed pumps.\"\n\nJohnny said, his eyebrows questioning, \"How did you know they were\ndestroyed?\"\n\n\"It doesn't seem to be much of a secret. The story is all about the\ncamp.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" Johnny sighed, then drawled to Derek, \"I say, Si, you better go\nget the hired hand, we might as well finish this up so we can get back\nto work.\"\n\nDerek nodded and left.\n\nJohnny McCord left the collator he'd been working with, went around\nbehind his desk and sat down. \"Take a chair, Miss Desage. I want to say\na few things in the way of background to you.\"\n\nShe sat, but said defiantly, \"I have no need of a lengthy lecture on\nthe glories of the Sahara Reforestation Commission.\"\n\n\"Coffee?\" Pierre Marimbert said politely.\n\n\"No, thank you.\"\n\nJohnny said, his voice thoughtful, \"I imagine the real starting point\nwas back about 1957 when the Chinese discovered that a nation's\ngreatest natural resource is its manpower.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe frowned at him. \"What in the world are you talking about?\"\n\nHe ignored her and went on. \"Originally, appalled by the job of feeding\nover half a billion mouths, they had initiated a birth control plan.\nBut after a year or two they saw it was the wrong approach. They were\ngoing to succeed, if they succeeded, in their _Great Leaps Forward_ by\nutilizing the labor of every man, woman and child in the country. And\nthat's what they proceeded to do. The lesson was brought home to the\nrest of the world in less than ten years, when such other countries as\nIndia and Indonesia failed to do the same.\"\n\nJohnny leaned back in his chair, and his eyes were thoughtful but\nunseeing. \"Even we of the west learned the lesson. The most important\nfactor in our leadership was our wonderful trained labor force. As\nfar back as 1960 we had more than 65 million Americans working daily\nin industry and distribution. Even the Russkies, with their larger\npopulation, didn't begin to equal that number.\"\n\n\"What are you driveling about?\" the reporter demanded.\n\n\"To sum it up,\" Johnny said mildly, \"the battle for men's minds\ncontinues and each of the world's great powers has discovered that\nit can't afford to limit its population--its greatest resource. So\npopulation continues to explode and the world is currently frantically\nseeking sources of food for its new billions. The Amazon basin is being\nmade into a tropical garden; the Japanese, landless, are devising a\nhundred methods of farming the sea; Australia is debouching into its\nlong unpopulated interior, doing much the same things we are here\nin the Sahara. The Chinese are over-flowing into Sinkiang, Mongolia\nand Tibet; the Russkies into Siberia. We of the west, with the large\nunderdeveloped areas of the western hemisphere have not been so greatly\npushed as some others. However, there is always tomorrow.\"\n\nDerek entered with Captain Mohammed Mohmoud. The latter day Rudolph\nValentino had a puzzled expression on his dark face.\n\n\"Here's the hired man, Hiram,\" Derek drawled.\n\nThe desert patrol officer nodded questioningly to the men and said,\n\"_Bonjour_,\" to H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Desage.\n\nJohnny went on. \"Yes, there's tomorrow. And by the time we run out\nof _Lebensraum_ in Brazil and Alaska, in Central America and the\nArgentine, in Texas and Saskatchewan, we're going to need the three\nmillion square miles of the Sahara.\"\n\nShe said in ridicule, \"It will take you a century at least to reforest\nthe desert.\"\n\n\"At least.\" Johnny nodded agreeably. \"And we're willing and able to\nlook that far ahead. Possibly by that time our opponents will also be\nlooking for new lands for their expanding peoples. And where will they\nfind them? The advantage will be ours, Miss Desage.\"\n\nMohammed Mohmoud looked from one to the other, frowning. \"What are we\ndiscussing?\" he said. \"I should be getting back to my men.\"\n\nDerek yawned and said, \"Forget about it, pal. You're never going to be\ngetting back to your men again.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe desert patrol officer's eyes widened. He turned his glare on Johnny\nMcCord, \"What is all this?\"\n\nJohnny said, \"I'll tell it, Derek.\"\n\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne Desage was as surprised as the Malian. \"What is going on? Are\nyou trying to whitewash yourselves by casting blame on this gentleman?\"\n\n\"Let me go on,\" Johnny said. \"Needless to say, there are conflicting\ninterests. The Soviet Complex obviously would as soon we didn't\nsucceed. However, wars are impractical today, and the Russkies and\nChinese are taken up with their own development. The Southeast Asia\nbloc wouldn't mind taking over here themselves, they desperately need\nland already. But they aren't our biggest opponents. There's another\ngroup even more involved--the _colons_ of Algeria and Morocco and those\nof even such Mali cities as Dakar. I suppose it is this last element\nthat you represent, Miss Desage.\"\n\nShe was staring unbelievingly at him now.\n\n\"Their interest is to get the Sahara Reforestation Commission out\nof the way so that they can immediately exploit the area. They are\ninterested in the _now_, not the potentialities of the future. They\nresent the use of the Niger for reforestation, when they could use it\nfor immediate irrigation projects. They would devote the full resources\nof the Mali Federation and Algeria to seeking oil and minerals and in\nthe various other ways the country might be exploited. Finally, they\nrather hate to see the western schools, hospitals, and other means used\nto raise the local living standards. They liked the low wage rates that\nformerly applied.\"\n\nJohnny nodded. \"Yes, I imagine that's your angle.\"\n\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne Desage stormed to her feet. \"I don't have to listen to this!\"\n\nDerek said, \"Honey, we sure aren't holding you. You're free to go any\ntime you want. And you can take this pal of yours along with you.\" He\njerked his head contemptuously at Mohammed Mohmoud.\n\nPierre Marimbert said, \"Mademoiselle, we have no idea of where you two\nmet originally, nor how close your relationship, but the captain should\nhave remembered that I too am French. A gentleman, on first meeting a\nlady, would never, never address her as _tu in our_ language.\"\n\nJohnny sighed again and looked at his watch. \"Other things pile up too,\nMiss Desage. You let slip a few moments ago that you knew about the\npumps being destroyed. You said the rumor was all around camp. But it\ncouldn't be. The only persons who knew about it were myself, Pierre\nand Derek. On top of that, there were no signs of bedouin or animals\nnear the exploded pumps; the person who did the job must have come in\nan aircraft or air-cushion car. And, besides, we found the pin of a\nhand grenade in your land rover this morning. We had thought at first\nthat dynamite had been used, but evidently you smuggled your much more\ncompact bombs across the desert with you. Obviously, no one would have\ndreamed of searching your vehicle.\n\n\"No, Miss Desage, it's obvious that you detoured from the track on the\nway down from Poste Weygand, went over to In Ziza, a comparatively\nshort distance, and blew up twenty-five of our pumps.\"\n\nJohnny turned to the Malian officer now. \"At the same time you were\ncoordinating with her, you and whatever gang is hiring you. Someone\nsupplied those Tuareg with the livestock and paid them to trek up here.\nYou, of course, turned your back and let them through. The same someone\nwho supplied the livestock also supplied Czech weapons.\"\n\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne Desage was still sputtering indignation. \"Ridiculous! Why? What\nwould motivate me to such nonsense?\"\n\nJohnny grimaced. \"The whole thing makes a beautiful story at a time\nwhen the American government is debating the practicality of the whole\nproject. You could do quite a sob story on the poor, poverty-stricken\nTuareg having their livestock destroyed. Then, quite a tale about the\nbedouin raiding our pumping stations and blowing them up. And quite a\ntale about the Tuareg being armed with Czech weapons. Oh, I imagine\nbefore it was through you'd have drawn a picture of civil war going\non here between the nomads and the Commission. Blowing up your own car\nwith a small bomb attached to the starter was just one more item. By\nthe way, were you going to do it yourself? Or did you intend to allow\none of our mechanics to kill himself?\"\n\nShe flushed. \"Don't be ridiculous. No one would have been hurt. The\nbomb is a very small one. More smoke and flash than anything else.\"\n\n\"Well, thanks for small favors,\" Derek said sarcastically.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe gave up. \"Very well,\" she snapped. \"There is nothing you can\ndo. This whole project, as I said before, is nothing but American\nboon-doggling, a way of plowing endless resources into a hole. Your\nreal motivation is an attempt to prevent depression and unemployment in\nyour country.\"\n\nPierre Marimbert said softly, \"So you admit to this whole scheme to\ndiscredit us?\"\n\n\"Why not?\" She turned to the door. \"I will still write my articles.\nIt's my word or yours.\"\n\nDerek grinned at her. \"I think I could fall in love with you, honey,\"\nhe said. \"Life would provide few dull moments. However, you didn't\nnotice how nice and automated this office is. Card machines, electric\ntypewriters, all the latest--including tape recorders for office\nconversations. You talked too much, honey.\"\n\n\"_Cochon!_\" she shrilled at him. She whirled and was through the door.\n\nJohnny turned to Mohammed Mohmoud. \"I guess the best thing for you\nwould be to turn in your commission, Captain.\"\n\nDark eyes snapped. \"And if I say no?\"\n\nJohnny shook his head. \"The Mali Federation passed some awfully strict\nlaws when it was drawing up its constitution. Among them was one\ninvolving capital punishment for anyone destroying a source of water in\nthe desert. Miss Desage did the actual work but you were hand in glove\nwith her. I'd hate to have to report that to your superiors.\"\n\nDerek jumped forward quickly. His hand snaked out and chopped the\nother's forearm. The heavy military pistol fell to the floor, and the\nCanadian kicked it to one side. \"Shucks,\" he drawled, \"the hired hand\nsure is tricky, ain't he?\"\n\n\"Good Lord,\" Johnny McCord said disgustedly, \"I didn't say I was going\nto report you. Just threatened to if you didn't resign. Now get out of\nhere, we've got work to do. I'm three days behind on my reports!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Farmer, by Mack Reynolds\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK FARMER ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51799-8.txt or 51799-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/7/9/51799/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
