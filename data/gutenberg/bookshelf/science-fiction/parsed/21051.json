Some of them I myself believe sound,\nothers I consider unsound, still others are out of my line, so that I am\nnot well enough informed upon their basic mathematical foundations to\nhave come to any definite conclusion, one way or the other. Whether or\nnot I consider any theory sound, I did not hesitate to disregard it, if\nits literal application would have interfered with the logical\ndevelopment of the story. In \"The Skylark of Space\" Mrs. Garby and I\ndecided, after some discussion, to allow two mathematical\nimpossibilities to stand. One of these immediately became the target of\ncritics from Maine to California and, while no astronomer has as yet\ncalled attention to the other, I would not be surprised to hear about\nit, even at this late date.\n\nWhile I do not wish it understood that I regard any of the major\nfeatures of this story as likely to become facts in the near\nfuture--indeed, it has been my aim to portray the highly improbable--it\nis my belief that there is no mathematical or scientific impossibility\nto be found in \"Skylark Three.\"\n\nIn fact, even though I have repeatedly violated theories in which I\nmyself believe, I have in every case taken great pains to make certain\nthat the most rigid mathematical analysis of which I am capable has\nfailed to show that I have violated any known and proven scientific\nfact. By \"fact\" I do not mean the kind of reasoning, based upon\nassumptions later shown to be fallacious, by which it was \"proved\" that\nthe transatlantic cable and the airplane were scientifically impossible.\nI refer to definitely known phenomena which no possible future\ndevelopment can change--I refer to mathematical proofs whose fundamental\nequations and operations involve no assumptions and contain no\nsecond-degree uncertainties.\n\nPlease bear in mind that we KNOW very little. It has been widely\nbelieved that the velocity of light is the limiting velocity, and many\nof our leading authorities hold this view--but it cannot be proved, and\nis by no means universally held. In this connection, it would appear\nthat J. J. Thompson, in \"Beyond the Electron\" shows, to his own\nsatisfaction at least, that velocities vastly greater than that of light\nare not only possible, but necessary to any comprehensive investigation\ninto the nature of the electron.\n\nWe do not know the nature of light. Neither the undulatory theory nor\nthe quantum theory are adequate to explain all observed phenomena, and\nthey seem to be mutually exclusive, since it would seem clear by\ndefinition that no one thing can be at the same time continuous and\ndiscontinuous. We know nothing of the ether--we do not even know whether\nor not it exists, save as a concept of our own extremely limited\nintelligence. We are in total ignorance of the ultimate structure of\nmatter, and of the arrangement and significance of those larger\naggregations of matter, the galaxies. We do not know nor understand, nor\ncan we define, even such fundamental necessities as time and space.\n\nWhy prate of \"the impossible\"?\n\nEdward Elmer Smith, Ph.D.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nDuQuesne Goes Traveling\n\n\nIn the innermost private office of Steel, Brookings and DuQuesne stared\nat each other across the massive desk. DuQuesne's voice was cold, his\nblack brows were drawn together.\n\n\"Get this, Brookings, and get it straight. I'm shoving off at twelve\no'clock tonight. My advice to you is to lay off Richard Seaton,\nabsolutely. Don't do a thing. _Nothing, hold everything._ Keep on\nholding it until I get back, no matter how long that may be,\" DuQuesne\nshot out in an icy tone.\n\n\"I am very much surprised at your change of front, Doctor. You are the\nlast man I would have expected to be scared off after one engagement.\"\n\n\"Don't be any more of a fool than you have to, Brookings. There's a lot\nof difference between scared and knowing when you are simply wasting\neffort. As you remember, I tried to abduct Mrs. Seaton by picking her\noff with an attractor from a space-ship. I would have bet that nothing\ncould have stopped me. Well, when they located me--probably with an\nautomatic Osnomian ray-detector--and heated me red-hot while I was still\nbetter than two hundred miles up, I knew then and there that they had us\nstopped; that there was nothing we could do except go back to my plan,\nabandon the abduction idea, and eventually kill them all. Since my plan\nwould take time, you objected to it, and sent an airplane to drop a\nfive-hundred-pound bomb on them. Airplane, bomb, and all simply\nvanished. It didn't explode, you remember, just flashed into light and\ndisappeared, with scarcely any noise. Then you pulled several more of\nyour fool ideas, such as long-range bombardment, and so on. None of\nthem worked. Still you've got the nerve to think that you can get them\nwith ordinary gunmen! I've drawn you diagrams and shown you\nfigures--I've told you in great detail and in one-syllable words exactly\nwhat we're up against. Now I tell you again that they've _got\nsomething_. If you had the brains of a pinhead, you would know that\nanything I can't do with a space-ship can't be done by a mob of ordinary\ngangsters. I'm telling you, Brookings, that you can't do it. My way is\nabsolutely the only way that will work.\"\n\n\"But five years, Doctor!\"\n\n\"I may be back in six months. But on a trip of this kind anything can\nhappen, so I am planning on being gone five years. Even that may not be\nenough--I am carrying supplies for ten years, and that box of mine in\nthe vault is not to be opened until ten years from today.\"\n\n\"But surely we shall be able to remove the obstructions ourselves in a\nfew weeks. We always have.\"\n\n\"Oh, quit kidding yourself, Brookings! This is no time for idiocy! You\nstand just as much chance of killing Seaton----\"\n\n\"Please, Doctor, please don't talk like that!\"\n\n\"Still squeamish, eh? Your pussyfooting always did give me an acute\npain. I'm for direct action, word and deed, first, last, and all the\ntime. I repeat, you have exactly as much chance of killing Richard\nSeaton as a blind kitten has.\"\n\n\"How do you arrive at that conclusion, Doctor? You seem very fond of\nbelittling our abilities. Personally, I think that we shall be able to\nattain our objectives within a few weeks--certainly long before you can\npossibly return from such an extended trip as you have in mind. And\nsince you are so fond of frankness, I will say that I think that Seaton\nhas you buffaloed, as you call it. Nine-tenths of these wonderful\nOsnomian things, I am assured by competent authorities, are\nscientifically impossible, and I think that the other one-tenth exists\nonly in your own imagination. Seaton was lucky in that the airplane bomb\nwas defective and exploded prematurely; and your space-ship got hot\nbecause of your injudicious speed through the atmosphere. We shall have\neverything settled by the time you get back.\"\n\n\"If you have, I'll make you a present of the controlling interest in\nSteel and buy myself a chair in some home for feeble-minded old women.\nYour ignorance and unwillingness to believe any new idea do not change\nthe facts in any particular. Even before they went to Osnome, Seaton was\nhard to get, as you found out. On that trip he learned so much new stuff\nthat it is now impossible to kill him by any ordinary means. You should\nrealize that fact when he kills every gangster you send against him. At\nall events be very, _very_ careful not to kill his wife in any of your\nattacks, even by accident, until after you have killed him.\"\n\n\"Such an event would be regrettable, certainly, in that it would remove\nall possibility of the abduction.\"\n\n\"It would remove more than that. Remember the explosion in our\nlaboratory, that blew an entire mountain into impalpable dust? Draw in\nyour mind a nice, vivid picture of one ten times the size in each of our\nplants and in this building. I know that you are fool enough to go ahead\nwith your own ideas, in spite of everything I've said; and, since I do\nnot yet actually control Steel, I can't forbid you to, officially. But\nyou should know that I know what I'm talking about, and I say again that\nyou're going to make an utter fool of yourself; just because you won't\nbelieve anything possible, that hasn't been done every day for a hundred\nyears. I wish that I could make you understand that Seaton and Crane\nhave got something that we haven't--but for the good of our plants, and\nincidentally for your own, please remember one thing, anyway; for if you\nforget it, we won't have a plant left and you personally will be blown\ninto a fine red mist. Whatever you start, kill Seaton first, and be\nabsolutely certain that he is definitely, completely, finally and\ntotally dead before you touch one of Dorothy Seaton's red hairs. As long\nas you only attack him personally he won't do anything but kill every\nman you send against him. If you kill her while he's still alive,\nthough--Blooie!\" and the saturnine scientist waved both hands in an\nexpressive pantomime of wholesale destruction.\n\n\"Probably you are right in that,\" Brookings paled slightly. \"Yes, Seaton\nwould do just that. We shall be very careful, until after we succeed in\nremoving him.\"\n\n\"Don't worry--you won't succeed. I shall attend to that detail myself,\nas soon as I get back. Seaton and Crane and their families, the\ndirectors and employees of their plants, the banks that by any\npossibility may harbor their notes or solutions--in short, every person\nand everything standing between me and a monopoly of 'X'--all shall\ndisappear.\"\n\n\"That is a terrible program, Doctor. Wouldn't the late Perkins' plan of\nan abduction, such as I have in mind, be better, safer and quicker?\"\n\n\"Yes--except for the fact that it will not work. I've talked until I'm\nblue in the face--I've proved to you over and over that you can't abduct\nher now without first killing him, and that you can't even touch him. My\nplan is the only one that will work. Seaton isn't the only one who\nlearned anything--I learned a lot myself. I learned one thing in\nparticular. Only four other inhabitants of either Earth or Osnome ever\nhad even an inkling of it, and they died, with their brains\ndisintegrated beyond reading. That thing is my ace in the hole. I'm\ngoing after it. When I get it, and not until then, will I be ready to\ntake the offensive.\"\n\n\"You intend starting open war upon your return?\"\n\n\"The war started when I tried to pick off the women with my attractor.\nThat is why I am leaving at midnight. He always goes to bed at\neleven-thirty, and I will be out of range of his object-compass before\nhe wakes up. Seaton and I understand each other perfectly. We both know\nthat the next time we meet one of us is going to be resolved into his\ncomponent atoms, perhaps into electrons. He doesn't know that he's going\nto be the one, but I do. My final word to you is to lay off--if you\ndon't, you and your 'competent authorities' are going to learn a lot.\"\n\n\"You do not care to inform me more fully as to your destination or your\nplans?\"\n\n\"I do not. Goodbye.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nDunark Visits Earth\n\n\nMartin Crane reclined in a massive chair, the fingers of his right hand\nlightly touching those of his left, listening attentively. Richard\nSeaton strode up and down the room before his friend, his unruly brown\nhair on end, speaking savagely between teeth clenched upon the stem of\nhis reeking, battered briar, brandishing a sheaf of papers.\n\n\"Mart, we're stuck--stopped dead. If my head wasn't made of solid blue\nmush I'd have had a way figured out of this thing before now, but I\ncan't. With that zone of force the Skylark would have everything\nimaginable--without it, we're exactly where we were before. That zone is\nimmense, man--terrific--its possibilities are unthinkable--and I'm so\ncussed dumb that I can't find out how to use it intelligently--can't use\nit at all, for that matter. By its very nature it is impenetrable to any\nform of matter, however applied; and this calc here,\" slapping viciously\nthe sheaf of papers containing his calculations, \"shows that it must\nalso be opaque to any wave whatever, propagated through air or through\nether, clear down to cosmic rays. Behind it, we would be blind and\nhelpless, so we can't use it at all. It drives me frantic! Think of a\nbarrier of pure force, impalpable, immaterial, and exerted along a\ngeometrical surface of no thickness whatever--and yet actual enough to\nstop even a Millikan ray that travels a hundred thousand light-years and\nthen goes through twenty-seven feet of solid lead just like it was so\nmuch vacuum! That's what we're up against! However, I'm going to try out\nthat model, Mart, right now. Come on, guy, snap into it! Let's get\nbusy!\"\n\n\"You are getting idiotic again, Dick,\" Crane rejoined calmly, without\nmoving. \"You know, even better than I do, that you are playing with the\nmost concentrated essence of energy that the world has ever seen. That\nzone of force probably can be generated----\"\n\n\"Probably, nothing!\" barked Seaton. \"It's just as evident a fact as that\nstool,\" kicking the unoffending bit of furniture half-way across the\nroom as he spoke. \"If you'd've let me, I'd've shown it to you\nyesterday!\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly, then. Grant that it is impenetrable to all matter and to\nall known waves. Suppose that it should prove impenetrable also to\ngravitation and to magnetism? Those phenomena probably depend upon the\nether, but we know nothing fundamental of their nature, nor of that of\nthe ether. Therefore your calculations, comprehensive though they are,\ncannot predict the effect upon them of your zone of force. Suppose that\nthat zone actually does set up a barrier in the ether, so that it\nnullifies gravitation, magnetism, and all allied phenomena; so that the\npower-bars, the attractors and repellers, cannot work through it? Then\nwhat? As well as showing me the zone of force, you might well have shown\nme yourself flying off into space, unable to use your power and helpless\nif you released the zone. No, we must know more of the fundamentals\nbefore you try even a small-scale experiment.\"\n\n\"Oh, bugs! You're carrying caution to extremes, Mart. What can happen?\nEven if gravitation should be nullified, I would rise only slowly,\nheading south the angle of our latitude--that's thirty-nine\ndegrees--away from the perpendicular. I couldn't shoot off on a tangent,\nas some of these hot-heads have been claiming. Inertia would make me\nkeep pace, approximately, with the earth in its rotation. I would rise\nslowly--only as fast as the tangent departs from the curvature of the\nearth's surface. I haven't figured out how fast that is, but it must be\npretty slow.\"\n\n\"Pretty slow?\" Crane smiled. \"Figure it out.\"\n\n\"All right--but I'll bet it's slower than the rise of a toy balloon.\"\nSeaton threw down the papers and picked up his slide-rule, a twenty-inch\ntrigonometrical duplex. \"You'll concede that it is allowable to neglect\nthe radial component of the orbital velocity of the earth for a first\napproximation, won't you--or shall I figure that in too?\"\n\n\"You may ignore that factor.\"\n\n\"All right--let's see. Radius of rotation here in Washington would be\ncosine latitude times equatorial radius, approximately--call it\nthirty-two hundred miles. Angular velocity, fifteen degrees an hour. I\nwant secant fifteen less one times thirty-two hundred. Right? Secant\nequals one over cosine--um-m-m-m--one point oh three five. Then point oh\nthree five times thirty-two hundred. Hundred and twelve miles first\nhour. Velocity constant with respect to sun, accelerated respecting\npoint of departure. Ouch! You win, Mart--I'd kinda step out! Well, how\nabout this, then? I'll put on a vacuum suit and carry rations. Harness\noutside, with the same equipment I used in the test flights before we\nbuilt _Skylark I--plus_ the new stuff and a coil. Then throw on the\nzone, and see what happens. There can't be any jar in taking off, and\nwith that outfit I can get back O. K. if I go clear to Jupiter!\"\n\nCrane sat in silence, his keen mind considering every aspect of the\nmotions possible, of velocity, of acceleration, of inertia. He already\nknew well Seaton's resourcefulness in crises and his physical and mental\nstrength.\n\n\"As far as I can see, that might be safe,\" he admitted finally, \"and we\nreally should know something about it besides the theory.\"\n\n\"Fine, Mart--let's get busy! I'll be ready in five minutes. Yell for the\ngirls, will you? They'd break us off at the ankles if we pull anything\nnew without letting them in on it.\"\n\nA few minutes later the \"girls\" strolled out into Crane Field, arms\naround each other--Dorothy Seaton, her gorgeous auburn hair framing\nviolet eyes and vivid coloring; black-haired, dark-eyed Margaret Crane.\n\n\"Br-r-r, it's cold!\" Dorothy shivered, wrapping her coat more closely\nabout her. \"This must be the coldest day Washington has seen for years!\"\n\n\"It is cold,\" Margaret agreed. \"I wonder what they are going to do out\nhere, this kind of weather?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs she spoke, the two men stepped out of the \"testing shed\"--the huge\nstructure that housed their Osnomian-built space-cruiser, \"Skylark II.\"\nSeaton waddled clumsily, wearing as he did a Crane vacuum-suit which,\nbuilt of fur, canvas, metal and transparent silica, braced by steel\nnetting and equipped with air-tanks and heaters, rendered its wearer\nindependent of outside conditions of temperature and pressure. Outside\nthis suit he wore a heavy harness of leather, buckled about his body,\nshoulders, and legs, attached to which were numerous knobs, switches,\ndials, bakelite cases, and other pieces of apparatus. Carried by a\nstrong aluminum framework in turn supported by the harness, the\nuniversal bearing of a small power-bar rose directly above his\ngrotesque-looking helmet.\n\n\"What do you think you're going to do in that thing, Dickie?\" Dorothy\ncalled. Then, knowing that he could not hear her voice, she turned to\nCrane. \"What are you letting that precious husband of mine do now,\nMartin? He looks as though he were up to something.\"\n\nWhile she was speaking, Seaton had snapped the release of his face\nplate.\n\n\"Nothing much, Dottie. Just going to show you-all the zone of force.\nMart wouldn't let me turn it on, unless I got all cocked and primed for\na year's journey into space.\"\n\n\"Dot, what is that zone of force, anyway?\" asked Margaret.\n\n\"Oh, it's something Dick got into his head during that awful fight they\nhad on Osnome. He hasn't thought of anything else since we got back. You\nknow how the attractors and repellers work? Well, he found out something\nfunny about the way everything acted while the Mardonalians were\nbombarding them with a certain kind of a wave-length. He finally figured\nout the exact ray that did it, and found out that if it is made strongly\nenough, it acts as if a repeller and attractor were working\ntogether--only so much stronger that nothing can get through the\nboundary, either way--in fact, it's so strong that it cuts anything in\ntwo that's in the way. And the funny thing is that there's nothing there\nat all, really; but Dick says that the forces meeting there, or\nsomething, make it act as though something really important were there.\nSee?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" assented Margaret, doubtfully, just as Crane finished the\nfinal adjustments and moved toward them. A safe distance away from\nSeaton, he turned and waved his hand.\n\nInstantly Seaton disappeared from view, and around the place where he\nhad stood there appeared a shimmering globe some twenty feet in\ndiameter--a globe apparently a perfect spherical mirror, which darted\nupward and toward the south. After a moment the globe disappeared and\nSeaton was again seen. He was now standing upon a hemispherical mass of\nearth. He darted back toward the group upon the ground, while the mass\nof earth fell with a crash a quarter of a mile away. High above their\nheads the mirror again encompassed Seaton, and again shot upward and\nsouthward. Five times this maneuver was repeated before Seaton came\ndown, landing easily in front of them and opening his helmet.\n\n\"It's just what we thought it was, only worse,\" he reported tersely.\n\"Can't do a thing with it. Gravitation won't work through it--bars\nwon't--nothing will. And dark? _Dark!_ Folks, you ain't never seen no\ndarkness, nor heard no silence. It scared me stiff!\"\n\n\"Poor little boy--afraid of the dark!\" exclaimed Dorothy. \"We saw\nabsolute blackness in space.\"\n\n\"Not like this, you didn't. I just saw absolute darkness and heard\nabsolute silence for the first time in my life. I never imagined\nanything like it--come on up with me and I'll show it to you.\"\n\n\"No you won't!\" his wife shrieked as she retreated toward Crane. \"Some\nother time, perhaps.\"\n\nSeaton removed the harness and glanced at the spot from which he had\ntaken off, where now appeared a hemispherical hole in the ground.\n\n\"Let's see what kind of tracks I left, Mart,\" and the two men bent over\nthe depression. They saw with astonishment that the cut surface was\nperfectly smooth, with not even the slightest roughness or irregularity\nvisible. Even the smallest loose grains of sand had been sheared in two\nalong a mathematically exact hemispherical surface by the inconceivable\nforce of the disintegrating copper bar.\n\n\"Well, that sure wins the----\"\n\nAn alarm bell sounded. Without a glance around, Seaton seized Dorothy\nand leaped into the testing shed. Dropping her unceremoniously to the\nfloor he stared through the telescope sight of an enormous ray-generator\nwhich had automatically aligned itself upon the distant point of\nliberation of intra-atomic energy which had caused the alarm to sound.\nOne hand upon the switch, his face was hard and merciless as he waited\nto make sure of the identity of the approaching space-ship, before he\nreleased the frightful power of his generator upon it.\n\n\"I've been expecting DuQuesne to try it again,\" he gritted, striving to\nmake out the visitor, yet more than two hundred miles distant. \"He's out\nto get you, Dot--and this time I'm not just going to warm him up and\nscare him away, as I did last time. This time that misguided mutt's\ngoing to get frizzled right.... I can't locate him with this small\ntelescope, Mart. Line him up in the big one and give me the word, will\nyou?\"\n\n\"I see him, Dick, but it is not DuQuesne's ship. It is built of\ntransparent arenak, like the 'Kondal.' Even though it seems impossible,\nI believe it is the 'Kondal'.\"\n\n\"Maybe so, and again maybe DuQuesne built it--or stole it. On second\nthought, though, I don't believe that DuQuesne would be fool enough to\ntackle us again in the same way--but I'm taking no chances.... O. K., it\nis the 'Kondal,' I can see Dunark and Sitar myself, now.\"\n\nThe transparent vessel soon neared the field and the four Terrestrials\nwalked out to greet their Osnomian friends. Through the arenak walls\nthey recognized Dunark, Kofedix of Kondal, at the controls, and saw\nSitar, his beautiful young queen, lying in one of the seats near the\nwall. She attempted a friendly greeting, but her face was strained as\nthough she were laboring under a burden too great for her to bear.\n\nAs they watched, Dunark slipped a helmet over his head and one over\nSitar's, pressed a button to open one of the doors, and supported her\ntoward the opening.\n\n\"They mustn't come out, Dick!\" exclaimed Dorothy in dismay. \"They'll\nfreeze to death in five minutes without any clothes on!\"\n\n\"Yes, and Sitar can't stand up under our gravitation, either--I doubt if\nDunark can, for long,\" and Seaton dashed toward the vessel, motioning\nthe visitor back.\n\nBut misunderstanding the signal, Dunark came on. As he clambered heavily\nthrough the door he staggered as though under an enormous weight, and\nSitar collapsed upon the frozen ground. Trying to help her,\nhalf-kneeling over her, Dunark struggled, his green skin paling to a\nyellowish tinge at the touch of the bitter and unexpected cold. Seaton\nleaped forward and gathered Sitar up in his mighty arms as though she\nwere a child.\n\n[Illustration: _Trying to help her, half kneeling over her, Dunark\nstruggled, his green skin paling to a yellowish tinge at the touch of\nthe bitter and unexpected cold._]\n\n\"Help Dunark back in, Mart,\" he directed crisply. \"Hop in, girls--we've\ngot to take these folks back up where they can live.\"\n\nSeaton shut the door, and as everyone lay flat in the seats Crane, who\nhad taken the controls, applied one notch of power and the huge vessel\nleaped upward. Miles of altitude were gained before Crane brought the\ncruiser to a stop and locked her in place with an anchoring attractor.\n\n\"There,\" he remarked calmly, \"gravitation here is approximately the same\nas it is upon Osnome.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" put in Seaton, standing up and shedding clothing in all\ndirections, \"and I rise to remark that we'd better undress as far as the\nlaw allows--perhaps farther. I never did like Osnomian ideas of\ncomfortable warmth, but we can endure it by peeling down to\nbedrock----\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSitar jumped up happily, completely restored, and the three women threw\ntheir arms around each other.\n\n\"What a horrible, terrible, frightful world!\" exclaimed Sitar, her eyes\nwidening as she thought of her first experience with our earth. \"Much as\nI love you, I shall never dare try to visit you again. I have never been\nable to understand why you Terrestrials wear what you call 'clothes,'\nnor why you are so terribly, brutally strong. Now I really know--I will\nfeel the utterly cold and savage embrace of that awful earth of yours as\nlong as I live!\"\n\n\"Oh, it's not so bad, Sitar.\" Seaton, who was shaking both of Dunark's\nhands vigorously, assured her over his shoulder. \"All depends on where\nyou were raised. We like it that way, and Osnome gives us the pip. But\nyou poor fish,\" turning again to Dunark, \"with all my brains inside your\nskull, you should have known what you were letting yourself in for.\"\n\n\"That's true, after a fashion,\" Dunark admitted, \"but your brain told me\nthat Washington was _hot_. If I'd have thought to recalculate your\nactual Fahrenheit degrees into our loro ... but that figures only\nforty-seven and, while very cold, we could have endured it--wait a\nminute, I'm getting it. You have what you call 'seasons.' This, then,\nmust be your 'winter.' Right?\"\n\n\"Right the first time. That's the way your brain works behind my pan,\ntoo. I could figure anything out all right after it happened, but hardly\never beforehand--so I guess I can't blame you much, at that. But what I\nwant to know is, how'd you get here? It would take more than my\nbrains--you can't see our sun from anywhere near Osnome, even if you\nknew exactly where to look for it.\"\n\n\"Easy. Remember those wrecked instruments you threw out of _Skylark I_\nwhen we built _Skylark II_?\" Having every minute detail of the\nconfiguration of Seaton's brain engraved upon his own, Dunark spoke\nEnglish in Seaton's own characteristic careless fashion. Only when\nthinking deeply or discussing abstruse matter did Seaton employ the\ncarefully selected and precise phrasing, which he knew so well how to\nuse. \"Well, none of them was beyond repair and the juice was still on\nmost of them. One was an object-compass bearing on the Earth. We simply\nfixed the bearings, put on some minor improvements, and here we are.\"\n\n\"Let us all sit down and be comfortable,\" he continued, changing into\nthe Kondalian tongue without a break, \"and I will explain why we have\ncome. We are in most desperate need of two things which you alone can\nsupply--salt, and that strange metal, 'X'. Salt I know you have in great\nabundance, but I know that you have very little of the metal. You have\nonly the one compass upon that planet?\"\n\n\"That's all--one is all we set on it. However, we've got close to half a\nton of the metal on hand--you can have all you want.\"\n\n\"Even if I took it all, which I would not like to do, that would be less\nthan half enough. We must have at least one of your tons, and two tons\nwould be better.\"\n\n\"Two tons! Holy cat! Are you going to plate a fleet of battle cruisers?\"\n\n\"More than that. We must plate an area of copper of some ten thousand\nsquare miles--in fact, the very life of our entire race depends upon\nit.\"\n\n\"It's this way,\" he continued, as the four earth-beings stared at him in\nwonder. \"Shortly after you left Osnome we were invaded by the\ninhabitants of the third planet of our fourteenth sun. Luckily for us\nthey landed upon Mardonale, and in less than two days there was not a\nsingle Osnomian left alive upon that half of the planet. They wiped out\nour grand fleet in one brief engagement, and it was only the _Kondal_\nand a few more like her that enabled us to keep them from crossing the\nocean. Even with our full force of these vessels, we cannot defeat them.\nOur regular Kondalian weapons were useless. We shot explosive copper\ncharges against them of such size as to cause earthquakes all over\nOsnome, without seriously crippling their defenses. Their offensive\nweapons are almost irresistible--they have generators that burn arenak\nas though it were so much paper, and a series of deadly frequencies\nagainst which only a copper-driven ray screen is effective, and even\nthat does not stand up long.\"\n\n\"How come you lasted till now, then?\" asked Seaton.\n\n\"They have nothing like the _Skylark_, and no knowledge of intra-atomic\nenergy. Therefore their space-ships are of the rocket type, and for that\nreason they can cross only at the exact time of conjunction, or whatever\nyou call it--no, not conjunction, exactly, either, since the two planets\ndo not revolve around the same sun: but when they are closest together.\nOur solar system is so complex, you know, that unless the trips are\ntimed exactly, to the hour, the vessels will not be able to land upon\nOsnome, but will be drawn aside and be lost, if not actually drawn into\nthe vast central sun. Although it may not have occurred to you, a little\nreflection will show that the inhabitants of all the central planets,\nsuch as Osnome, must perforce be absolutely ignorant of astronomy, and\nof all the wonders of outer space. Before your coming we knew nothing\nbeyond our own solar system, and very little of that. We knew of the\nexistence of only such of the closest planets as were brilliant enough\nto be seen in our continuous sunlight, and they were few. Immediately\nafter your coming I gave your knowledge of astronomy to a group of our\nforemost physicists and mathematicians, and they have been working\nceaselessly from space-ships--close enough so that observations could be\nrecalculated to Osnome, and yet far enough away to afford perfect\n'seeing,' as you call it.\"\n\n\"But I don't know any more about astronomy than a pig does about\nSunday,\" protested Seaton.\n\n\"Your knowledge of details is, of course, incomplete,\" conceded Dunark,\n\"but the detailed knowledge of the best of your Earthly astronomers\nwould not help us a great deal, since we are so far removed from you in\nspace. You, however, have a very clear and solid knowledge of the\nfundamentals of the science, and that is what we need, above all\nthings.\"\n\n\"Well, maybe you're right, at that. I do know the general theory of the\nmotions, and I studied some Celestial Mechanics. I'm awfully weak on\nadvanced theory, though, as you'll find out when you get that far.\"\n\n\"Perhaps--but since our enemies have no knowledge of astronomy whatever,\nit is not surprising that their rocket-ships can be launched only at one\nparticularly favorable time; for there are many planets and satellites,\nof which they can know nothing, to throw their vessels off the course.\n\n\"Some material essential to the operation of their war machinery\napparently must come from their own planet, for they have ceased\nattacking, have dug in, and are simply holding their ground. It may be\nthat they had not anticipated as much resistance as we could offer with\nspace-ships and intra-atomic energy. At any rate, they have apparently\nsaved enough of that material to enable them to hold out until the next\nconjunction--I cannot think of a better word for it--shall occur. Our\nforces are attacking constantly, with all the armament at our command,\nbut it is certain that if the next conjunction is allowed to occur, it\nmeans the end of the entire Kondalian nation.\"'\n\n\"What d'you mean 'if the next conjunction is _allowed_ to occur?'\"\ninterjected Seaton. \"Nobody can stop it.\"\n\n\"I am stopping it,\" Dunark stated quietly, grim purpose in every\nlineament. \"That conjunction shall never occur. That is why I must have\nthe vast quantities of salt and 'X'. We are building abutments of arenak\nupon the first satellite of our seventh planet, and upon our sixth\nplanet itself. We shall cover them with plated active copper, and\ninstall chronometers to throw the switches at precisely the right\nmoment. We have calculated the exact times, places, and magnitudes of\nthe forces to be used. We shall throw the sixth planet some distance out\nof its orbit, and force the first satellite of the seventh planet clear\nout of that planet's influence. The two bodies whose motions we have\nthus changed will collide in such a way that the resultant body will\nmeet the planet of our enemies in head-on collision, long before the\nnext conjunction. The two bodies will be of almost equal masses, and\nwill have opposite and approximately equal velocities; hence the\nresultant fused or gaseous mass will be practically without velocity and\nwill fall directly into the fourteenth sun.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't it be easier to destroy it with an explosive copper bomb?\"\n\n\"Easier, yes, but much more dangerous to the rest of our solar system.\nWe cannot calculate exactly the effect of the collisions we are\nplanning--but it is almost certain that an explosion of sufficient\nviolence to destroy all life upon the planet would disturb its motion\nsufficiently to endanger the entire system. The way we have in mind will\nsimply allow the planet and one satellite to drop out quietly--the other\nplanets of the same sun will soon adjust themselves to the new\nconditions, and the system at large will be practically unaffected--at\nleast, so we believe.\"\n\nSeaton's eyes narrowed as his thoughts turned to the quantities of\ncopper and \"X\" required and to the engineering features of the project;\nCrane's first thought was of the mathematics involved in a computation\nof that magnitude and character; Dorothy's quick reaction was one of\npure horror.\n\n\"He can't, Dick! He mustn't! It would be too ghastly! It's\noutrageous--it's unthinkable--it's--it's--it's simply too horrible!\" Her\nviolet eyes flamed, and Margaret joined in:\n\n\"That would be awful, Martin. Think of the destruction of a whole\nplanet--of an entire world--with all its inhabitants! It makes me\nshudder, even to think of it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDunark leaped to his feet, ablaze. But before he could say a word,\nSeaton silenced him.\n\n\"Shut up, Dunark! Pipe down! Don't say anything you'll be sorry for--let\n_me_ tell 'em! Close your mouth, I tell you!\" as Dunark still tried to\nget a word in, \"I tell you I'll tell 'em, and when I tell 'em they stay\ntold! Now listen, you two girls--you're going off half-cocked and you're\nboth full of little red ants. What do you think Dunark is up against?\nSherman chirped it when he described war--and this is a real he-war; a\nbrand totally unknown on our Earth. It isn't a question of whether or\nnot to destroy a population--the only question is which population is to\nbe destroyed. One of them's got to go. Remember those folks go into a\nwar thoroughly, and there isn't a thought, even remotely resembling our\nconception of mercy in any of their minds on either side. If Dunark's\nplans go through the enemy nation will be wiped out. That is horrible,\nof course. But on the other hand, if we block him off from salt and 'X,'\nthe entire Kondalian nation will be destroyed just as thoroughly and\nefficiently, and even more horribly--not one man, woman, or child would\nbe spared. Which nation do you want saved? Play that over a couple of\ntimes on your adding machine, Dot, and let me know what you get.\"\n\nDorothy, taken aback, opened and closed her mouth twice before she found\nher voice.\n\n\"But, Dick, they couldn't possibly. Would they kill them all, Dick?\nSurely they wouldn't--they _couldn't_.\"\n\n\"Surely they would--and could. They do--it's good technique in those\nparts of the Galaxy. Dunark has just told us of how they killed every\nmember of the entire race of Mardonalians, in forty hours. Kondal would\ngo the same way. Don't kid yourself, Dimples--don't be a child. War up\nthere is _no_ species of pink tea, believe me--half of my brain has been\nthrough thirty years of Osnomian warfare, and I know precisely what I'm\ntalking about. Let's take a vote. Personally, I'm in favor of Osnome.\nMart?\"\n\n\"Osnome.\"\n\n\"Dottie? Peggy?\" Both remained silent for some time, then Dorothy turned\nto Margaret.\n\n\"You tell him, Peggy--we both feel the same way.\"\n\n\"Dick, you know that we wouldn't want the Kondalians destroyed--but the\nother is so--such a--well, such an utter _shrecklichkeit_--isn't there\nsome other way out?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid not--but if there is any other possible way out, I'll do my\nda--to help find it,\" he promised. \"The ayes have it. Dunark, we'll skip\nover to that 'X' planet and load you up.\"\n\nDunark grasped Seaton's hand. \"Thanks, Dick,\" he said, simply. \"But\nbefore you help me farther, and lest I might be in some degree sailing\nunder false colors, I must tell you that, wearer of the seven disks\nthough you are, Overlord of Osnome though you are, my brain brother\nthough you are; had you decided against me, nothing but my death could\nhave kept me away from that salt and your 'X' compass.\"\n\n\"Why sure,\" assented Seaton, in surprise. \"Why not? Fair enough! Anybody\nwould do the same--don't let that bother you.\"\n\n\"How is your supply of platinum?\" asked Dunark.\n\n\"Mighty low. We had about decided to hop over there after some. I want\nsome of your textbooks on electricity and so on, too. I see you brought\na load of platinum with you.\"\n\n\"Yes, a few hundred tons. We also brought along an assortment of books I\nknew you would be interested in, a box of radium, a few small bags of\ngems of various kinds, and some of our fabrics, Sitar thought your\nKarfediro would like to have. While we are here, I would like to get\nsome books on chemistry and some other things.\"\n\n\"We'll get you the Congressional Library, if you want it, and anything\nelse you think you'd like. Well, gang, let's go places and do things!\nWhat to do, Mart?\"\n\n\"We had better drop back to Earth, have the laborers unload the\nplatinum, and load on the salt, books, and other things. Then both ships\nwill go to the 'X' planet, as we will each want compasses on it, for\nfuture use. While we are loading, I should like to begin remodeling our\ninstruments; to make them something like these; with Dunark's\npermission. These instruments are wonders, Dick--vastly ahead of\nanything I have ever seen. Come and look at them, if you want to see\nsomething really beautiful.\"\n\n\"Coming up. But say, Mart, while I think of it, we mustn't forget to\ninstall a zone-of-force apparatus on this boat, too. Even though we\ncan't use it intelligently, it certainly would be a winner as a defense.\nWe couldn't hurt anybody through it, of course, but if we should happen\nto be getting licked anywhere, all we'd have to do would be to wrap\nourselves up in it. They couldn't touch us. Nothing in the ether\nspectrum is corkscrewy enough to get through it.\"\n\n\"That's the second idea you've had since I've known you, Dicky,\" Dorothy\nsmiled at Crane. \"Do you think he should be allowed to run at large,\nMartin?\"\n\n\"That is a real idea. We may need it--you never can tell. Even if we\nnever find any other use for the zone of force, that one is amply\nsufficient to justify its installation.\"\n\n\"Yes, it would be, for you--and I'm getting to be a regular Safety-First\nSimon myself, since they opened up on us. What about those instruments?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe three men gathered around the instrument-board and Dunark explained\nthe changes he had made--and to such men as Seaton and Crane it was soon\nevident that they were examining an installation embodying sheer\nperfection of instrumental control--a system which only those wonder\ninstrument-makers, the Osnomians, could have devised. The new\nobject-compasses were housed in arenak cases after setting, and the\nhousings were then exhausted to the highest attainable vacuum.\nOscillation was set up by means of one carefully standardized electrical\nimpulse, instead of by the clumsy finger-touch Seaton had used. The\nbearings, built of arenak and Osnomian jewels, were as strong as the\naxles of a truck and yet were almost perfectly frictionless.\n\n\"I like them myself,\" admitted Dunark. \"Without a load the needles will\nrotate freely more than a thousand hours on the primary impulse, as\nagainst a few minutes in the old type; and under load they are many\nthousands of times as sensitive.\"\n\n\"You're a blinding flash and a deafening report, ace!\" declared Seaton,\nenthusiastically. \"That compass is as far ahead of my model as the\n_Skylark_ is ahead of Wright's first glider.\"\n\nThe other instruments were no less noteworthy. Dunark had adopted the\nPerkins telephone system, but had improved it until it was scarcely\nrecognized and had made it capable of almost unlimited range. Even the\nguns--heavy rapid-firers, mounted in spherical bearings in the\nwalls--were aimed and fired by remote control, from the board. He had\ndevised full automatic steering controls; and meters and recorders for\nacceleration, velocity, distance, and flight-angle. He had perfected a\nsystem of periscopic vision, which enabled the pilot to see the entire\noutside surfaces of the shell, and to look toward any point of the\nheavens without interference.\n\n\"This kind of takes my eye, too, prince,\" Seaton said, as he seated\nhimself, swung a large, concave disk in front of him, and experimented\nwith levers and dials. \"You certainly can't call this thing a\nperiscope--it's no more a periscope than I am a polyp. When you look\nthrough this plate, it's better than looking out of a window--it\nsubtends more than the angle of vision, so that you can't see anything\nbut out-of-doors--I thought for a second I was going to fall out. What\ndo you call 'em, Dunark?\"\n\n\"Kraloto. That would be in English ... Seeing-plate? Or rather, call it\n'visiplate'.\"\n\n\"That's a good word. Mart, take a look if you want to see a set of\nperfect lenses and prisms.\"\n\nCrane looked into the visiplate and gasped. The vessel had\ndisappeared--he was looking directly down upon the Earth below him!\n\n\"No trace of chromatic, spherical, or astigmatic aberration,\" he\nreported in surprise. \"The refracting system is invisible--it seems as\nthough nothing intervenes between the eye and the object. You perfected\nall these things since we left Osnome, Dunark? You are in a class by\nyourself. I could not even copy them in less than a month, and I never\ncould have invented them.\"\n\n\"I did not do it alone, by any means. The Society of Instrument-Makers,\nof which I am only one member, installed and tested more than a hundred\nsystems. This one represents the best features of all the systems tried.\nIt will not be necessary for you to copy them. I brought along two\ncomplete duplicate sets for the _Skylark_, as well as a dozen or so of\nthe compasses. I thought that perhaps these particular improvements\nmight not have occurred to you, since you Terrestrials are not as\nfamiliar as we are with complex instrumental work.\"\n\nCrane and Seaton spoke together.\n\n\"That was thoughtful of you, Dunark, and we appreciated it fully.\"\n\n\"That puts four more palms on your _Croix de Guerre_, ace. Thanks a\nlot.\"\n\n\"Say, Dick,\" called Dorothy, from her seat near the wall. \"If we're\ngoing down to the ground, how about Sitar?\"\n\n\"By lying down and not doing anything, and by staying in the vessel,\nwhere it is warm, she will be all right for the short time we must stay\nhere,\" Dunark answered for his wife. \"I will help all I can, but I do\nnot know how much that will be.\"\n\n\"It isn't so bad lying down.\" Sitar agreed. \"I don't like your Earth a\nbit, but I can stand it a little while. Anyway, I _must_ stand it, so\nwhy worry about it?\"\n\n\"'At-a-girl!\" cheered Seaton. \"And as for you, Dunark, you'll pass the\ntime just like Sitar does--lying down. If you do much chasing around\ndown there where we live, you're apt to get your lights and liver\ntwisted all out of shape--so you'll stay put, horizontal. We've got men\nenough around the shop to eat this cargo in three hours, let alone\nunload it. While they unload and load you up, we'll install the zone\napparatus, put a compass on you, put one of yours on us, and then you\ncan hop back up here where you're comfortable. Then as soon as we can\nget the 'Lark' ready for the trip, we'll jump up here and be on our way.\nEverything clear? Cut the rope, Mart--let the old bucket drop!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nSkylark Two Sets Out\n\n\n\"Say, Mart, I just got conscious! It never occurred to me until just\nnow, as Dunark left, that I'm as good an instrument-maker as Dunark\nis--the same one, in fact--and I've got a hunch. You know that needle on\nDuQuesne hasn't been working for quite a while? Well, I don't believe\nit's out of commission at all. I think he's gone somewhere, so far away\nthat it can't read on him. I'm going to house it in, re-jewel it, and\nfind out where he is.\"\n\n\"An excellent idea. He has even you worrying, and as for myself----\"\n\n\"Worrying! That bird is simply pulling my cork! I'm so scared he'll get\nDottie, that I'm running around in circles and biting myself in the\nsmall of the back. He's got a hen on, you can bet your shirt on\nthat--what gravels me is he's aiming at the girls, not at us or the\njob.\"\n\n\"I should say that someone had aimed at you fairly accurately, judging\nby the number of bullets stopped lately by that arenak armor of yours. I\nwish that I could take some of the strain, but they are centering all\ntheir attacks upon you.\"\n\n\"Yes--I can't stick my nose outside our yard without somebody throwing\nlead at it. It's funny, too. You're more important to the power-plant\nthan I am.\"\n\n\"You should know why. They are not afraid of me. While my spirit is\nwilling enough, it was your skill and rapidity with a pistol that\nfrustrated four attempts at abduction in as many days. It is positively\nuncanny, the way you explode into action. With all my practice, I didn't\neven have my pistol out yesterday until it was all over. And besides\nPrescott's guards, we had four policemen with us--detailed to 'guard'\nus--because of the number of gunmen you had to kill before that!\"\n\n\"It ain't practice so much, Mart--it's a gift. I've always been fast,\nand I react automatically. You think first, that's why you're slow.\nThose cops were funny. They didn't know what it was all about until it\nwas all over--all but calling the wagon. That was the worst yet. One of\ntheir slugs struck directly in front of my left eye--it was kinda funny,\nat that, seeing it splash--and I thought I was inside a boiler in a\nriveting shop when those machine-guns cut loose. It was hectic, all\nright, while it lasted. But one thing I'll tell the attentive\nworld--we're not doing all the worrying. Very few, if any, of the\ngangsters they send after us are getting back. Wonder what they think\nwhen they shoot at us and we don't drop?\n\n\"But I'm afraid I'm beginning to crack, Mart,\" Seaton went on, his voice\nbecoming grimly earnest. \"I don't like anything about this whole mess. I\ndon't like all four of us wearing armor all the time. I don't like\nliving constantly under guard. I don't like all this killing. And this\nconstant menace of losing Dorothy, if I let her out of my sight for five\nseconds, is driving me mad. To tell you the real truth, I'm devilishly\nafraid that they'll figure out something that'll work. I could grab off\ntwo women, or kill two men, if they had armor and guns enough to stock a\nwar. I believe that DuQuesne could, too--and the rest of that bunch\naren't imbeciles, either, by any means. I won't feel safe until all four\nof us are in the _Skylark_ and a long ways from here. I'm sure glad\nwe're pulling out; and I don't intend to come back until I get a good\nline on DuQuesne. He's the bird I'm going to get, and get right--and\nwhen I get him I'll tell the cock-eyed world he'll stay got. There won't\nbe any two atoms of his entire carcass left in the same township. I\nmeant that promise when I gave it to him!\"\n\n\"He realizes that fully. He knows that it is now definitely either his\nlife or our own, and he is really dangerous. When he took Steel over and\nopened war upon us, he did it with his eyes wide open. With his ideas,\nhe must have a monopoly of 'X' or nothing; and he knows the only\npossible way of getting it. However, you and I both know that he would\nnot let either one of us live, even though we surrendered.\"\n\n\"You chirped it! But that guy's going to find he's started something,\nunless I get paralysis of the intentions. Well, how about turning up a\nfew R. P. M.? We don't want to keep Dunark waiting too long.\"\n\n\"There is very little to do beyond installing the new instruments; and\nthat is nearly done. We can finish pumping out the compass _en route_.\nYou have already installed every weapon of offense and defense known to\neither Earthly or Osnomian warfare, including those ray-generators and\nscreens you moaned so about not having during the battle over Kondal. I\nbelieve that we have on board every article for which either of us has\nbeen able to imagine even the slightest use.\"\n\n\"Yes, we've got her so full of plunder that there's hardly room left for\nquarters. You ain't figuring on taking anybody but Shiro along, are\nyou?\"\n\n\"No. I suppose there is no real necessity for taking even him, but he\nwants very much to go, and may prove himself useful.\"\n\n\"I'll say he'll be useful. None of us really enjoys polishing brass or\nwashing dishes--and besides, he's one star cook and an A-1 housekeeper.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe installation of the new instruments was soon completed, and while\nDorothy and Margaret made last-minute preparations for departure, the\nmen called a meeting of the managing directors and department heads of\nthe \"Seaton-Crane Co., Engineers.\" The chiefs gave brief reports in\nturn. Units Number One and Number Two of the immense new central\nsuper-power plant were in continuous operation. Number Three was almost\nready to cut in. Number Four was being rushed to completion. Number Five\nwas well under way. The research laboratory was keeping well up on its\nproblems. Troubles were less than had been anticipated. Financially, it\nwas a gold mine. With no expense for boilers or fuel, and thus with a\nrelatively small investment in plant and a very small operating cost,\nthey were selling power at one-sixth of prevailing rates, and still\nprofits were almost paying for all new construction. With the completion\nof Number Five, rates would be reduced still further.\n\n\"In short, Dad, everything's slick,\" remarked Seaton to Mr. Vaneman,\nafter the others had gone.\n\n\"Yes; your plan of getting the best men possible, paying them well, and\ngiving them complete authority and sole responsibility, has worked to\nperfection. I have never seen an undertaking of such size go forward so\nsmoothly and with such fine co-operation.\"\n\n\"That's the way we wanted it. We hand-picked the directors, and put it\nup to you, strictly. You did the same to the managers. Everybody knows\nthat his end is up to him, and him alone--so he digs in.\"\n\n\"However, Dick, while everything at the works is so fine, when is this\nother thing going to break?\"\n\n\"We've won all the way so far, but I'm afraid something's about due.\nThat's the big reason I want to get Dot away for a while. You know what\nthey're up to?\"\n\n\"Too well,\" the older man answered. \"Dottie or Mrs. Crane, or both. Her\nmother--she is telling her goodbye now--and I agree that the danger here\nis greater than out there.\"\n\n\"Danger out there? With the old can fixed the way she is now, Dot's a\nlot safer there than you are in bed. Your house might fall down, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"You're probably right, son--I know you, and I know Martin Crane.\nTogether, and in the _Skylark_, I believe you invincible.\"\n\n\"All set, Dick?\" asked Dorothy, appearing in the doorway.\n\n\"All set. You've got the dope for Prescott and everybody Dad. We may be\nback in six months, or we may see something to investigate, and be gone\na year or so. Don't begin to lose any sleep until after we've been\nout--oh, say three years. We'll make it a point to be back by then.\"\n\nFarewells were said; the party embarked, and _Skylark Two_ shot upward.\nSeaton flipped a phone set over his head and spoke.\n\n\"Dunark!... Coming out, heading directly for 'X'.... No, better stay\nquite a ways off to one side when we get going good.... Yes, I'm\naccelerating twenty six point oh oh oh.... Yes. I'll call you now and\nthen, until the radio waves get lost, to check the course with you.\nAfter that, keep on the last course, reverse at the calculated distance,\nand by the time we're pretty well slowed down, we'll feel around for\neach other with the compasses and go in together.... Right....\nUh-huh.... Fine! So long!\"\n\nIn order that the two vessels should keep reasonably close together, it\nhad been agreed that each should be held at an acceleration of exactly\ntwenty-six feet per second, positive and negative. This figure\nrepresented a compromise between the gravitational forces of the two\nworlds upon which the different parties lived. While considerably less\nthan the acceleration of gravitation at the surface of the Earth, the\nTerrestrials could readily accustom themselves to it; and it was not\nenough greater than that of Osnome to hamper seriously the activities of\nthe green people.\n\nWell clear of the Earth's influence, Seaton assured himself that\neverything was functioning properly, then stretched to his full height,\nwreathed his arms over his head, and heaved a deep sigh of relief.\n\n\"Folks,\" he declared, \"This is the first time I've felt right since we\ngot out of this old bottle. Why, I feel so good a cat could walk up to\nme and scratch me right in the eye, and I wouldn't even scratch back.\nYowp! I'm a wild Siberian catamount, and this is my night to howl.\nWhee-ee-yerow!\"\n\nDorothy laughed, a gay, lilting carol.\n\n\"Haven't I always told you he had cat blood in him, Peggy? Just like all\ntomcats, every once in a while he has to stretch his claws and yowl. But\ngo ahead, Dickie, I like it--this is the first uproar you've made in\nweeks. I believe I'll join you!\"\n\n\"It most certainly is a relief to get this load off our minds: I could\ndo a little ladylike yowling myself,\" Margaret said; and Crane, lying\ncompletely at ease, a thin spiral of smoke curling upward from his\ncigarette, nodded agreement.\n\n\"Dick's yowling is quite expressive at times. All of us feel the same\nway, but some of us are unable to express ourselves quite so vividly.\nHowever, it is past bedtime, and we should organize our crew. Shall we\ndo it as we did before?\"\n\n\"No, it isn't necessary. Everything is automatic. The bar is held\nparallel to the guiding compass, and signal bells ring whenever any of\nthe instruments show a trace of abnormal behavior. Don't forget that\nthere is at least one meter registering and recording every factor of\nour flight. With this control system we can't get into any such jam as\nwe did last trip.\"\n\n\"Surely you are not suggesting that we run all night with no one at the\ncontrols?\"\n\n\"Exactly that. A man camping at this board is painting the lily and\ngilding fine gold. Awake or asleep nobody need be closer to it than is\nnecessary to hear a bell if one should ring, and you can hear them all\nover the ship. Furthermore, I'll bet a hat we won't hear a signal a\nweek. Simply as added precaution, though, I've run lines so that any\ntime one of these signals lets go, it sounds a buzzer on the head of our\nbed, so I'm automatically taking the night shift. Remember, Mart, these\ninstruments are thousands of times as sensitive as the keenest human\nsenses--they'll spot trouble long before we could, even if we were\nlooking right at it.\"\n\n\"Of course, you understand these instruments much better than I do, as\nyet. If you trust them, I am perfectly willing to do the same.\nGoodnight.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSeaton sat down and Dorothy nestled beside him, her head snuggled into\nthe curve of his shoulder.\n\n\"Sleepy, cuddle-pup?\"\n\n\"Heavens, no! I couldn't sleep now, lover--could you?\"\n\n\"Not any. What's the use?\"\n\nHis arm tightened around her. Apparently motionless to its passengers,\nthe cruiser bored serenely on into space, with ever-mounting velocity.\nThere was not the faintest sound, not the slightest vibration--only the\npeculiar violet glow surrounding the shining copper cylinder in its\nmassive universal bearing gave any indication of the thousands of\nkilowatts being generated in the mighty intra-atomic power-plant. Seaton\nstudied it thoughtfully.\n\n\"You know, if that violet aura and copper bar were a little different in\nshade and tone of color, they'd be just like your eyes and hair,\" he\nremarked finally.\n\n\"You burn me up, Dick!\" she retorted, her entrancing low chuckle\nbubbling through her words. \"You do say the weirdest things at times!\nPossibly they would--and if the moon were made of different stuff than\nit is and had a different color, it might be green cheese, too! What say\nwe go over and look at the stars?\"\n\n\"As you were, Rufus!\" he commanded sternly. \"Don't move a\nmillimeter--you're a drive fit, right where you are. I'll get you any\nstars you want, and bring them right in here to you. What constellation\nwould you like? I'll get you the Southern Cross--we never see it in\nWashington.\"\n\n\"No, I want something familiar; the Pleiades or the Big Dipper--no, get\nme Canis Major--'where Sirius, brightest jewel in the diadem of the\nfirmament, holds sway',\" she quoted. \"There! Thought I'd forgotten all\nthe astronomy you ever taught me, didn't you? Think you can find it?\"\n\n\"Sure. Declination about minus twenty, as I remember it, and right\nascension between six and seven hours. Let's see--where would that be\nfrom our course?\"\n\nHe thought for a moment, manipulated several levers and dials, snapped\noff the lights, and swung number one exterior visiplate around, directly\nbefore their eyes.\n\n\"Oh.... Oh ... this is magnificent, Dick!\" she exclaimed. \"It's\nstupendous. It seems as though we were right out there in space itself,\nand not in here at all. It's ... it's just too perfectly darn\nwonderful!\"\n\nAlthough neither of them was unacquainted with interstellar space, it\npresents a spectacle that never fails to awe even the most seasoned\nobserver: and no human being had ever before viewed the wonders of space\nfrom such a coign of vantage. Thus the two fell silent and awed as they\ngazed out into the abysmal depths of the interstellar void. The darkness\nof Earthly night is ameliorated by light-rays scattered by the\natmosphere: the stars twinkle and scintillate and their light is\ndiffused, because of the same medium. But here, what a contrast! They\nsaw the utter, absolute darkness of the complete absence of all light:\nand upon that indescribable blackness they beheld superimposed the\nalmost unbearable brilliance of enormous suns concentrated into\nmathematical points, dimensionless. Sirius blazed in blue-white\nsplendor, dominating the lesser members of his constellation, a minute\nbut intensely brilliant diamond upon a field of black velvet--his\nrefulgence unmarred by any trace of scintillation or distortion.\n\nAs Seaton slowly shifted the field of vision, angling toward and across\nthe celestial equator and the ecliptic, they beheld in turn mighty\nRigel; The Belt, headed by dazzlingly brilliant-white Delta-Orionis; red\nBetelguese; storied Aldebaran, the friend of mariners; and the\nastronomically constant Pleiades.\n\nSeaton's arm contracted, swinging Dorothy into his embrace; their lips\nmet and held.\n\n\"Isn't it wonderful, lover,\" she murmured, \"to be out here in space this\nway, together, away from all our troubles and worries? I am so happy.\"\n\n\"It's all of that, sweetheart mine!\"\n\n\"I almost died, every time they shot at you. Suppose your armor cracked\nor something? I wouldn't want to go on living--I'd just naturally die!\"\n\n\"I'm glad it didn't--and I'm twice as glad that they didn't succeed in\ngrabbing you away from me....\" His jaw set rigidly, his gray eyes became\nhard as tempered drills. \"Blackie DuQuesne has something coming to him.\nSo far, I have always paid my debts.... I shall settle with him ... IN\nFULL.\"\n\n\"That was an awfully quick change of subject,\" he continued, his voice\nchanging instantly into a lighter vein, \"but that's one penalty of being\nhuman. We can't live in high altitudes all our lives--if we could there\nwould be no thrill in ascending them so often.\n\n\"Yes, we love each other just the same--more than anybody else I ever\nheard of.\" After a moment she eyed him shrewdly and continued:\n\n\"You've got something on your mind besides that tangled mop of hair, big\nboy. Tell it to Red-Top.\"\n\n\"Nothing much....\"\n\n\"Come on, 'fess up--it's good for the soul. You can't fool your own\nwife, guy; I know your little winning ways too well.\"\n\n\"Let me finish, woman; I was about to bare my very soul. To\nresume--nothing much to go on but a hunch, but I think DuQuesne's\nsomewhere out here in the great open spaces, where men are sometimes\nschemers as well as men; and if so, I'm after him--foot, horse, and\nmarines.\"\n\n\"That object compass?\"\n\n\"Yes. You see, I built that thing myself, and I know darn well it isn't\nout of order. It's still on him, but doesn't indicate. Ergo, he is too\nfar away to reach--and with his weight, I could find him anywhere up to\nabout one and a half light-years. If he wants to go that far away from\nhome, where is his logical destination? It can't be anywhere but Osnome,\nsince that is the only place we stopped at for any length of time--the\nonly place where he could have learned anything. He's learned something,\nor found something useful to him there, just as we did. That is certain,\nsince he is not the type of man to do anything without a purpose. Uncle\nDudley is on his trail--and will be able to locate him pretty soon.\"\n\n\"When will you get that new compass-case exhausted to a skillionth of a\nwhillimeter or something, whatever it is? I thought Dunark said it took\nfive hundred hours of pumping to get it where he wanted it?\"\n\n\"It did him--but while the Osnomians are wonders at some things, they're\nnot so hot at others. You see, I've got three pumps on that job, in\nseries. First, a Rodebush-Michalek super-pump[A] then, backing that, an\nordinary mercury-vapor pump, and last, backing both the others, a\nCenco-Hyvac motor-driven oil pump. In less than fifty hours that case\nwill be as empty as a flapper's skull. Just to make sure of cleaning up\nthe last infinitesimal traces, though, I'm going to flash a getter\ncharge of tantalum in it. After that, the atmosphere in that case will\nbe tenuous--take my word for it.\"\n\n    [A] J. Am. Chem. Soc. 51: 3, 750.\n\n\"I'll have to; most of that contribution to science being over my head\nlike a circus tent. What say we let _Skylark Two_ drift by herself for a\nwhile, and catch us some of Nature's sweet restorer?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nThe Zone of Force Is Tested\n\n\nSeaton strode into the control room with a small oblong box in his hand.\nCrane was seated at the desk, poring over an abstruse mathematical\ntreatise in _Science_. Margaret was working upon a bit of embroidery.\nDorothy, seated upon a cushion on the floor with one foot tucked under\nher, was reading, her hand straying from time to time to a box of\nchocolates conveniently near.\n\n\"Well, this is a peaceful, home-like scene--too bad to bust it up. Just\nfinished sealing off and flashing out this case, Mart. Going to see if\nshe'll read. Want to take a look?\"\n\nHe placed the compass upon the plane table, so that its final bearing\ncould be read upon the master circles controlled by the gyroscopes; then\nsimultaneously started his stop-watch and pressed the button which\ncaused a minute couple to be applied to the needle. Instantly the needle\nbegan to revolve, and for many minutes there was no apparent change in\nits motion in either the primary or secondary bearings.\n\n\"Do you suppose it is out of order, after all?\" asked Crane,\nregretfully.\n\n\"I don't think so,\" Seaton pondered. \"You see, they weren't designed to\nindicate such distances on such small objects as men, so I threw a\nmillion ohms in series with the impulse. That cuts down the free\nrotation to less than half an hour, and increases the sensitivity to the\nlimit. There, isn't she trying to quit it?\"\n\n\"Yes, it is settling down. It must be on him still.\" Finally the\nultra-sensitive needle came to rest. When it had done so, Seaton\ncalculated the distance, read the direction, and made a reading upon\nOsnome.\n\n\"He's there, all right. Bearings agree, and distances check to within a\nlight-year, which is as close as we can hope to check on as small a mass\nas a man. Well, that's that--nothing to do about it until after we get\nthere. One sure thing, Mart--we're not coming straight back home from\n'X'.\"\n\n\"No, an investigation is indicated.\"\n\n\"Well, that puts me out of a job. What to do? Don't want to study, like\nyou. Can't crochet, like Peg. Darned if I'll sit cross-legged on a\npillow and eat candy, like that Titian blonde over there on the floor. I\nknow what--I'll build me a mechanical educator and teach Shiro to talk\nEnglish instead of that mess of language he indulges in. How'd that be,\nMart?\"\n\n\"Don't do it,\" put in Dorothy, positively. \"He's just too perfect the\nway he is. Especially don't do it if he'd talk the way you do--or could\nyou teach him to talk the way you write?\"\n\n\"Ouch! That's a dirty dig. However, Mrs. Seaton, I am able and willing\nto defend my customary mode of speech. You realize that the spoken word\nis ephemeral, whereas the thought, whose nuances have once been\nexpressed in imperishable print is not subject to revision--its\ncrudities can never be remodeled into more subtle, more gracious\nshading. It is my contention that, due to these inescapable conditions,\nthe mental effort necessitated by the employment of nice distinctions in\nsense and meaning of words and a slavish adherence to the dictates of\nthe more precise grammarians should be reserved for the print....\"\n\nHe broke off as Dorothy, in one lithe motion, rose and hurled her pillow\nat his head.\n\n\"Choke him, somebody! Perhaps you had better build it, Dick, after all.\"\n\n\"I believe that he would like it, Dick. He is trying hard to learn, and\nthe continuous use of a dictionary is undoubtedly a nuisance to him.\"\n\n\"I'll ask him. Shiro!\"\n\n\"You have call, sir?\" Shiro entered the room from his galley, with his\nunfailing bow.\n\n\"Yes. How'd you like to learn to talk English like Crane there\ndoes--without taking lessons?\"\n\nShiro smiled doubtfully, unable to take such a thought seriously.\n\n\"Yes, it can be done,\" Crane assured him. \"Doctor Seaton can build a\nmachine which will teach you all at once, if you like.\"\n\n\"I like, sir, enormously, yes, sir. I years study and pore, but\nhonorable English extraordinary difference from Nipponese--no can do.\nDictionary useful but ...\" he flipped pages dexterously, \"extremely\ncumbrous. If honorable Seaton can do, shall be extreme ...\ngratification.\"\n\nHe bowed again, smiled, and went out.\n\n\"I'll do just that little thing. So long, folks, I'm going up to the\nshop.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDay after day the _Skylark_ plunged through the vast emptiness of the\ninterstellar reaches. At the end of each second she was traveling\nexactly twenty-six feet per second faster than she had been at its\nbeginning; and as day after day passed, her velocity mounted into\nfigures which became meaningless, even when expressed in thousands of\nmiles per second. Still she seemed stationary to her occupants, and only\ndifferent from a vessel motionless upon the surface of the Earth in that\nobjects within her hull had lost three-sixteenths of their normal\nweight. Acceleration, too, had its effect. Only the rapidity with which\nthe closer suns and their planets were passed gave any indication of the\nfrightful speed at which they were being hurtled along by the\ninconceivable power of that disintegrating copper bar.\n\nWhen the vessel was nearly half-way to \"X,\" the bar was reversed in\norder to change the sign of their acceleration, and the hollow sphere\nspun through an angle of one hundred and eighty degrees around the\nmotionless cage which housed the enormous gyroscopes. Still apparently\nmotionless and exactly as she had been before, the _Skylark_ was now\nactually traveling in a direction which seemed \"down\" and with a\nvelocity which was being constantly decreased by the amount of their\nnegative acceleration.\n\nA few days after the bar had been reversed Seaton announced that the\nmechanical educator was complete, and brought it into the control room.\n\nIn appearance it was not unlike a large radio set, but it was infinitely\nmore complex. It possessed numerous tubes, kino-lamps, and\nphoto-electric cells, as well as many coils of peculiar design--there\nwere dozens of dials and knobs, and a multiple set of head-harnesses.\n\n\"How can a thing like that possibly work as it does?\" asked Crane. \"I\nknow that it does work, but I could scarcely believe it, even after it\nhad educated me.\"\n\n\"That is nothing like the one Dunark used, Dick,\" objected Dorothy. \"How\ncome?\"\n\n\"I'll answer you first, Dot. This is an improved model--it has quite a\nfew gadgets of my own in it. Now, Mart, as to how it works--it isn't so\nfunny after you understand it--it's a lot like radio in that respect. It\noperates on a band of frequencies lying between the longest light and\nheat waves and the shortest radio waves. This thing here is the\ngenerator of those waves and a very heavy power amplifier. The headsets\nare stereoscopic transmitters, taking or receiving a three-dimensional\nview. Nearly all matter is transparent to those waves; for instance\nbones, hair, and so on. However, cerebin, a cerebroside peculiar to the\nthinking structure of the brain, is opaque to them. Dunark, not knowing\nchemistry, didn't know why the educator worked or what it worked on--he\nfound out by experiment that it did work; just as we found out about\nelectricity. This three-dimensional model, or view, or whatever you want\nto call it, is converted into electricity in the headsets, and the\nresulting modulated wave goes back to the educator. There it is\nheterodyned with another wave--this second frequency was found after\nthousands of trials and is, I believe, the exact frequency existing in\nthe optic nerves themselves--and sent to the receiving headset.\nModulated as it is, and producing a three-dimensional picture, after\nrectification in the receiver, it reproduces exactly what has been\n'viewed,' if due allowance has been made for the size and configuration\nof the different brains involved in the transfer. You remember a sort of\nflash--a sensation of seeing something--when the educator worked on\nyou? Well, you did see it, just as though it had been transmitted to the\nbrain by the optic nerve, but everything came at once, so the impression\nof sight was confused. The result in the brain, however, was clear and\npermanent. The only drawback is that you haven't the visual memory of\nwhat you have learned, and that sometimes makes it hard to use your\nknowledge. You don't know whether you know anything about a certain\nsubject or not until after you go digging around in your brain looking\nfor it.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Crane, and Dorothy, the irrepressible, put in:\n\n\"Just as clear as so much mud. What are the improvements you added to\nthe original design?\"\n\n\"Well, you see, I had a big advantage in knowing that cerebrin was the\nsubstance involved, and with that knowledge I could carry matters\nconsiderably farther than Dunark could in his original model. I can\ntransfer the thoughts of somebody else to a third party or to a record.\nDunark's machine couldn't work against resistance--if the subject wasn't\nwilling to give up his thoughts he couldn't get them. This one can take\nthem away by force. In fact, by increasing plate and grid voltages in\nthe amplifier, I can pretty nearly burn out a man's brain. Yesterday, I\nwas playing with it, transferring a section of my own brain to a\nmagnetized tape--for a permanent record, you know--and found out that\nabove certain rather low voltages it becomes a form of torture that\nwould make the best efforts of the old Inquisition seem like a petting\nparty.\"\n\n\"Did you succeed in the transfer?\" Crane was intensely interested.\n\n\"Sure. Push the button for Shiro, and we'll start something.\"\n\n\"Put your head against this screen,\" he directed when Shiro had come in,\nsmiling and bowing as usual. \"I've got to caliper your brains to do a\ngood job.\"\n\nThe calipering done, he adjusted various dials and clamped the\nelectrodes over his own head and over the heads of Crane and Shiro.\n\n\"Want to learn Japanese while we're at it, Mart? I'm going to.\"\n\n\"Yes, please. I tried to learn it while I was in Japan, but it was\naltogether too difficult to be worth while.\"\n\nSeaton threw in a switch, opened it, depressed two more, opened them,\nand threw off the power.\n\n\"All set,\" he reported crisply, and barked a series of explosive\nsyllables at Shiro, ending upon a rising note.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" answered the Japanese. \"You speak Nipponese as though you\nhad never spoken any other tongue. I am very grateful to you, sir, that\nI may now discard my dictionary.\"\n\n\"How about you two girls--anything you want to learn in a hurry?\"\n\n\"Not me!\" declared Dorothy emphatically. \"That machine is too darn weird\nto suit me. Besides, if I knew as much about science as you do, we'd\nprobably fight about it.\"\n\n\"I do not believe I care to....\" began Margaret.\n\nShe was interrupted by the penetrating sound of an alarm bell.\n\n\"That's a new note!\" exclaimed Seaton, \"I never heard that note before.\"\n\nHe stood in surprise at the board, where a brilliant purple light was\nflashing slowly. \"Great Cat! That's a purely Osnomian war-gadget--kind\nof a battleship detector--shows that there's a boatload of bad news\naround here somewhere. Grab the visiplates quick, folks,\" as he rang\nShiro's bell. \"I'll take visiplate area one, dead ahead. Mart, take\nnumber two. Dot, three; Peg, four; Shiro, five. Look sharp!... Nothing\nin front. See anything, any of you?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNone of them could discover anything amiss, but the purple light\ncontinued to flash, and the bell to ring. Seaton cut off the bell.\n\n\"We're almost to 'X',\" he thought aloud. \"Can't be more than a million\nmiles or so, and we're almost stopped. Wonder if somebody's there ahead\nof us? Maybe Dunark is doing this, though. I'll call him and see.\" He\nthrew in a switch and said one word--\"Dunark!\"\n\n\"Here!\" came the voice of the Kofedix from the speaker. \"Are you\ngenerating?\"\n\n\"No--just called to see if you were. What do you make of it?\"\n\n\"Nothing as yet. Better close up?\"\n\n\"Yes, edge over this way and I'll come over to meet you. Leave your\nnegative as it is--we'll be stopped directly. Whatever it is, it's dead\nahead. It's a long ways off yet, but we'd better get organized. Wouldn't\ntalk much, either--they may intercept our wave, narrow as it is.\"\n\n\"Better yet, shut off your radio entirely. When we get close enough\ntogether, we'll use the hand-language. You may not know that you know\nit, but you do. Turn your heaviest searchlight toward me--I'll do the\nsame.\"\n\nThere was a click as Dunark's power was shut off abruptly, and Seaton\ngrinned as he cut his own.\n\n\"That's right, too, folks. In Osnomian battles we always used a\nsign-language when we couldn't hear anything--and that was most of the\ntime. I know it as well as I know English, now that I am reminded of the\nfact.\"\n\nHe shifted his course to intercept that of the Osnomian vessel. After a\ntime the watchers picked out a minute point of light, moving\ncomparatively rapidly against the stars, and knew it to be the\nsearchlight of the _Kondal_. Soon the two vessels were almost side by\nside, moving cautiously forward, and Seaton set up a sixty-inch\nparabolic reflector, focused upon a coil. As they went on, the purple\nlight continued to flash more and more rapidly, but still nothing was to\nbe seen.\n\n\"Take number six visiplate, will you, Mart? It's telescopic, equivalent\nto a twenty-inch refractor. I'll tell you where to look in a\nminute--this reflector increases the power of the regular indicator.\" He\nstudied meters and adjusted dials. \"Set on nineteen hours forty-three\nminutes, and two hundred seventy-one degrees. He's too far away yet to\nread exactly, but that'll put him in the field of vision.\"\n\n\"Is this radiation harmful?\" asked Margaret.\n\n\"Not yet--it's too weak. Pretty soon we may be able to feel it; then\nI'll throw out a screen against it. When it's strong enough, it's pretty\ndeadly stuff. See anything, Mart?\"\n\n\"I see something, but it is very indistinct. It is moving in sharper\nnow. Yes, it is a space-ship, shaped like a dirigible airship.\"\n\n\"See it yet, Dunark?\" Seaton signaled.\n\n\"Just sighted it. Ready to attack?\"\n\n\"I am not. I'm going to run. Let's go, and go fast!\"\n\nDunark signaled violently, and Seaton shook his head time after time,\nstubbornly.\n\n\"A difficulty?\" asked Crane.\n\n\"Yes. He wants to go jump on it, but I'm not looking for trouble with\nany such craft as that--it must be a thousand feet long and is certainly\nneither Terrestrial nor Osnomian. I say beat it while we're all in one\npiece. How about it?\"\n\n\"Absolutely,\" concurred Crane and both women.\n\nThe bar was reversed and the _Skylark_ leaped away. The _Kondal_\nfollowed, although the observers could see that Dunark was raging.\nSeaton swung number six visiplate around, looked once, and switched on\nthe radio.\n\n\"Well, Dunark,\" he said grimly. \"You get your wish. That bird is coming\nout, with at least twice the acceleration we could get with both motors\nfull on. He saw us all the time, and was waiting for us.\"\n\n\"Go on--get away if you can. You can stand a higher acceleration than we\ncan. We'll hold him as long as possible.\"\n\n\"I would, if it would do any good, but it won't. He's so much faster\nthan we are that he could catch us anyway, if he wanted to, no matter\nhow much of a start we had--and it looks now as though he wanted us. Two\nof us stand a lot better chance than one of licking him if he's looking\nfor trouble. Spread out a mile or two, and pretend this is all the speed\nwe've got. What'll we give him first?\"\n\n\"Give him everything at once. Rays six, seven, eight, nine, and ten....\"\nCrane, with Seaton, began making contacts, rapidly but with precision.\n\"Heat wave two-seven. Induction, five-eight. Oscillation, everything\nunder point oh six three. All the explosive copper we can get in.\nRight?\"\n\n\"Right--and if worse comes to worst, remember the zone of force. Let him\nshoot first, because he may be peaceable--but it doesn't look like olive\nbranches to me.\"\n\n\"Got both your screens out?\"\n\n\"Yes. Mart, you might take number two visiplate and work the guns--I'll\nhandle the rest of this stuff. Better strap yourselves in solid,\nfolks--this may develop into a kind of rough party, by the looks of\nthings right now.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs he spoke, a pyrotechnic display enveloped the entire ship as a\nradiation from the foreign vessel struck the other neutralizing screen\nand dissipated its force harmlessly in the ether. Instantly Seaton threw\non the full power of his refrigerating system and shot in the master\nswitch that actuated the complex offensive armament of his dreadnought\nof the skies. An intense, livid violet glow hid completely main and\nauxiliary power bars, and long flashes leaped between metallic objects\nin all parts of the vessel. The passengers felt each hair striving to\nstand on end as the very air became more and more highly charged--and\nthis was but the slight corona-loss of the frightful stream of\ndestruction being hurled at the other space-cruiser, now scarcely a mile\naway!\n\nSeaton stared into number one visiplate, manipulating levers and dials\nas he drove the _Skylark_ hither and yon, dodging frantically, the while\nthe automatic focusing devices remained centered upon the enemy and the\nenormous generators continued to pour forth their deadly frequencies.\nThe bars glowed more fiercely as they were advanced to full working\nload--the stranger was one blaze of incandescent ionization, but she\nstill fought on; and Seaton noticed that the pyrometers recording the\ntemperature of the shell were mounting rapidly, in spite of the\nrefrigerators.\n\n\"Dunark, put everything you've got upon one spot--right on the end of\nhis nose!\"\n\nAs the first shell struck the mark, Seaton concentrated every force at\nhis command upon the designated point. The air in the _Skylark_ crackled\nand hissed and intense violet flames leaped from the bars as they were\ndriven almost to the point of disruption. From the forward end of the\nstrange craft there erupted prominence after prominence of searing,\nunbearable flame as the terrific charges of explosive copper struck the\nmark and exploded, liberating instantaneously their millions upon\nmillions of kilowatt-hours of intra-atomic energy. Each prominence\nenveloped all three of the fighting vessels and extended for hundreds of\nmiles out into space--but still the enemy warship continued to hurl\nforth solid and vibratory destruction.\n\nA brilliant orange light flared upon the panel, and Seaton gasped as he\nswung his visiplate upon his defenses, which he had supposed\nimpregnable. His outer screen was already down, although its mighty\ncopper generator was exerting its utmost power. Black areas had already\nappeared and were spreading rapidly, where there should have been only\nincandescent radiance; and the inner screen was even now radiating far\ninto the ultra-violet and was certainly doomed. Knowing as he did the\nstupendous power driving those screens, he knew that there were\nsuperhuman and inconceivable forces being directed against them, and his\nright hand flashed to the switch controlling the zone of force. Fast as\nhe was, much happened in the mere moment that passed before his flying\nhand could close the switch. In the last infinitesimal instant of time\nbefore the zone closed in, a gaping black hole appeared in the\nincandescence of the inner screen, and a small portion of a ray of\nenergy so stupendous as to be palpable, struck, like a tangible\nprojectile, the exposed flank of the _Skylark_. Instantly the refractory\narenak turned an intense, dazzling white and more than a foot of the\nforty-eight-inch skin of the vessel melted away, like snow before an\noxy-acetylene flame: melting and flying away in molten globes and\nsparkling gases--the refrigerating coils lining the hull were of no\navail against the concentrated energy of that titanic thrust. As Seaton\nshut off his power, intense darkness and utter silence closed in, and he\nsnapped on the lights.\n\n\"They take one trick!\" he blazed, his eyes almost emitting sparks, and\nleaped for the generators. He had forgotten the efforts of the zone of\nforce, however, and only sprawled grotesquely in the air until he\nfloated within reach of a line.\n\n\"Hold everything, Dick!\" Crane snapped, as Seaton bent over one of the\nbars. \"What are you going to do?\"\n\n\"I'm going to put as heavy bars in these ray-generators as they'll stand\nand go out and get that bird. We can't lick him with Osnomian rays or\nwith our explosive copper, but I can carve that sausage into slices with\na zone of force, and I'm going to do it.\"\n\n\"Steady, old man--take it easy. I see your point, but remember that you\nmust release the zone of force before you can use it as a weapon.\nFurthermore, you must discover his exact location, and must get close\nenough to him to use the zone as a weapon, all without its protection.\nCan those ray-screens be made sufficiently powerful to withstand the\nbeam they employed last, even for a second?\"\n\n\"Hm ... m ... m. Never thought of that, Mart,\" Seaton replied, the fire\ndying out of his eyes. \"Wonder how long the battle lasted?\"\n\n\"Eight and two-tenths seconds, from first to last, but they had had\nthat heavy ray in action only a fraction of one second when you cut\nin the zone of force. Either they underestimated our strength at first,\nor else it required about eight seconds to tune in their heavy\ngenerators--probably the former.\"\n\n\"But we've _got_ to do something, man! We can't just sit here and\ntwiddle our thumbs!\"\n\n\"Why, and why not? That course seems eminently wise and proper. In fact,\nat the present time, thumb-twiddling is distinctly indicated.\"\n\n\"Oh, you're full of little red ants! We can't do a thing with that zone\non--and you say just sit here. Suppose they know all about that zone of\nforce? Suppose they can crack it? Suppose they ram us?\"\n\n\"I shall take up your objections in order,\" Crane had lighted a\ncigarette and was smoking meditatively. \"First, they may or may not know\nabout it. At present, that point is immaterial. Second, whether or not\nthey know about it, it is almost a certainty that they cannot crack it.\nIt had been up for more than three minutes, and they have undoubtedly\nconcentrated everything possible upon us during that time. It is still\nstanding. I really expected it to go down in the first few seconds, but\nnow that it has held this long it will, in all probability, continue to\nhold indefinitely. Third, they most certainly will not ram us, for\nseveral reasons. They probably have encountered few, if any, foreign\nvessels able to stand against them for a minute, and will act\naccordingly. Then, too, it is probably safe to assume that their vessel\nis damaged, to some slight extent at least; for I do not believe that\nany possible armament could withstand the forces you directed against\nthem and escape entirely unscathed. Finally, if they did ram us, what\nwould happen? Would we feel the shock? That barrier in the ether seems\nimpervious, and if so, it could not transmit a blow. I do not see\nexactly how it would affect the ship dealing the blow. You are the one\nwho works out the new problems in unexplored mathematics--some time you\nmust take a few months off and work it out.\"\n\n\"Yes, it would take that long, too, I guess--but you're right, he can't\nhurt us. That's using the old bean, Mart! I was going off half-cocked\nagain, darn it! I'll pipe down, and we'll go into a huddle.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSeaton noticed that Dorothy's face was white and that she was fighting\nfor self-control. Drawing himself over to her, he picked her up in a\ntight embrace.\n\n\"Cheer up, Red-Top! This man's war ain't started yet!\"\n\n\"Not started? What do you mean? Haven't you and Martin just been\nadmitting to each other that you can't do anything? Doesn't that mean\nthat we are beaten?\"\n\n\"Beaten! Us? How do you get that way? Not on your sweet young life!\" he\nejaculated, and the surprise on his face was so manifest that she\nrecovered instantly. \"We've just dug a hole and pulled the hole in after\nus, that's all! When we get everything doped out to suit us, we'll snap\nout of it and that bird'll think he's been petting a wildcat!\"\n\n\"Mart, you're the thinking end of this partnership,\" he continued,\nthoughtfully. \"You've got the analytical mind and the judicial\ndisposition, and can think circles around me. From what little you've\nseen of those folks, tell me who, what, and where they are. I'm getting\nthe germ of an idea, and maybe we can make it work.\"\n\n\"I will try it.\" Crane paused. \"They are, of course, neither from the\nEarth nor from Osnome. It is also evident that they have solved the\nsecret of intra-atomic energy. Their vessels are not propelled as ours\nare--they have so perfected that force that it acts upon every particle\nof the structure and its contents....\"\n\n\"How do you figure that?\" blurted Seaton.\n\n\"Because of the acceleration they can stand. Nothing even semi-human,\nand probably nothing living, could endure it otherwise. Right?\"\n\n\"Yes--I never thought of that.\"\n\n\"Furthermore, they are far from home, for if they were from anywhere\nnearby, the Osnomians would have known of them--particularly since it is\nevident from the size of the vessel that it is not a recent development\nwith them, as it is with us. Since the green system is close to the\ncenter of the Galaxy, it seems reasonable, as a working hypothesis, to\nassume that they are from some system far from the center, perhaps close\nto the outer edge. They are very evidently of a high degree of\nintelligence. They are also highly treacherous and merciless....\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Dorothy, who was listening eagerly.\n\n\"I deduce those characteristics from their unprovoked attack upon\npeaceful ships, vastly smaller and supposedly of inferior armament; and\nalso from the nature of that attack. This vessel is probably a scout or\nan exploring ship, since it seems to be alone. It is not altogether\nbeyond the bounds of reason to imagine it upon a voyage of discovery, in\nsearch of new planets to be subjugated and colonized....\"\n\n\"That's a sweet picture of our future neighbors--but I guess you're\nhitting the old nail on the head, at that.\"\n\n\"If these deductions are anywhere nearly correct, they are terrible\nneighbors. For my next point, are we justified in assuming that they do\nor do not know about the zone of force?\"\n\n\"That's a hard one. Knowing what they evidently do know, it's hard to\nsee how they could have missed it. And yet, if they had known about it\nfor a long time, wouldn't they be able to get through it? Of course it\nmay be a real and total barrier in the ether--in that case they'd know\nthat they couldn't do a thing as long as we keep it on. Take your\nchoice, but I believe that they know about it, and know more than we\ndo--that it is a total barrier set up in the ether.\"\n\n\"I agree with you, and we shall proceed upon that assumption. They know,\nthen, that neither they nor we can do anything as long as we maintain\nthe zone--that it is a stalemate. They also know that it takes an\nenormous amount of power to keep the zone in place. Now we have gone as\nfar as we can go upon the meager data we have--considerably farther than\nwe really are justified in going. We must now try to come to some\nconclusion concerning their present activities. If our ideas as to their\nnatures are even approximately correct, they are waiting, probably\nfairly close at hand, until we shall be compelled to release the zone,\nno matter how long that period of waiting shall be. They know, of\ncourse, from our small size, that we cannot carry enough copper to\nmaintain it indefinitely, as they could. Does that sound reasonable?\"\n\n\"I check you to nineteen decimal places, Mart, and from your ideas I'm\ngetting surer and surer that we can pull their corks. I can get into\naction in a hurry when I have to, and my idea now is to wait until they\nrelax a trifle, and then slip a fast one over on them. One more bubble\nout of the old think-tank and I'll let you off for the day. At what time\nwill their vigilance be at lowest ebb? That's a poser, I'll admit, but\nthe answer to it may answer everything--the first shot will, of course,\nbe the best chance we'll ever have.\"\n\n\"Yes, we should succeed in the first attempt. We have very little\ninformation to guide us in answering that question.\" He studied the\nproblem for many minutes before he resumed, \"I should say that for a\ntime they would keep all their rays and other weapons in action against\nthe zone of force, expecting us to release it immediately. Then, knowing\nthat they were wasting power uselessly, they would cease attacking, but\nwould be very watchful, with every eye fastened upon us and with every\nweapon ready for instant use. After this period of vigilance, regular\nship's routine would be resumed. Half the force, probably, would go off\nduty--for, if they are even remotely like any organic beings with which\nwe are familiar, they require sleep or its equivalent at intervals. The\nmen on duty--the normal force, that is--would be doubly careful for a\ntime. Then habit will assert itself, if we have done nothing to create\nsuspicion, and their watchfulness will relax to the point of ordinary\ncareful observation. Toward the end of their watch, because of the\nstrain of the battle and because of the unusually long period of duty,\nthey will become careless, and their vigilance will be considerably\nbelow normal. But the exact time of all these things depends entirely\nupon their conception of time, concerning which we have no information\nwhatever. Though it is purely a speculation, based upon Earthly and\nOsnomian experience, I should say that after twelve or thirteen hours\nwould come the time for us to make the attack.\"\n\n\"That's good enough for me. Fine, Mart, and thanks. You've probably\nsaved the lives of the party. We will now sleep for eleven or twelve\nhours.\"\n\n\"Sleep, Dick! How could you?\" Dorothy exclaimed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nFirst Blood\n\n\nThe next twelve hours dragged with terrible slowness. Sleep was\nimpossible and eating was difficult, even though all knew that they\nwould have need of the full measure of their strength. Seaton set up\nvarious combinations of switching devices connected to electrical\ntimers, and spent hours trying, with all his marvelous quickness of\nmuscular control, to cut shorter and ever shorter the time between the\nopening and the closing of the switch. At last he arranged a powerful\nelectro-magnetic device so that one impulse would both open and close\nthe switch, with an open period of one one-thousandth of a second. Only\nthen was he satisfied.\n\n\"A thousandth is enough to give us a look around, due to persistence of\nvision; and it is short enough so that they won't see it unless they\nhave a recording observer on us. Even if they still have rays on us,\nthey can't possibly neutralize our screens in that short an exposure.\nAll right, gang? We'll take five visiplates and cover the sphere. If any\nof you get a glimpse of him, mark the exact spot and outline on the\nglass. All set?\"\n\nHe pressed the button. The stars flashed in the black void for an\ninstant, then were again shut out.\n\n\"Here he is, Dick!\" shrieked Margaret. \"Right here--he covered almost\nhalf the visiplate!\"\n\nShe outlined for him, as nearly as she could, the exact position of the\nobject she had seen, and he calculated rapidly.\n\n\"Fine business!\" he exulted. \"He's within half a mile of us,\nthree-quarters on--perfect! I thought he'd be so far away that I'd have\nto take photographs to locate him. He hasn't a single ray on us, either.\nThat bird's goose is cooked right now, folks, unless every man on watch\nhas his hand right on the controls of a generator and can get into\naction in less than a tenth of a second! Hang on, gang, I'm going to\nstep on the gas!\"\n\nAfter making sure that everyone was fastened immovably in their seats he\nstrapped himself in the pilot's seat, then set the bar toward the\nstrange vessel and applied fully one-third of its full power. The\n_Skylark_, of course, did not move. Then, with bewildering rapidity, he\nwent into action; face glued to the visiplate, hands moving faster than\nthe eye could follow--the left closing and opening the switch\ncontrolling the zone of force, the right swinging the steering controls\nto all points of the sphere. The mighty vessel staggered this way and\nthat, jerking and straining terribly as the zone was thrown on and off,\nlurching sickeningly about the central bearing as the gigantic power of\nthe driving bar was exerted, now in one direction, now in another. After\na second or two of this mad gyration, Seaton shut off the power. He then\nreleased the zone, after assuring himself that both inner and outer\nscreens were operating at the highest possible rating.\n\n\"There, that'll hold 'em for a while, I guess. This battle was even\nshorter than the other one--and a lot more decisive. Let's turn on the\nflood-lights and see what the pieces look like.\"\n\nThe lights revealed that the zone of force had indeed sliced the enemy\nvessel into pieces. No fragment was large enough to be navigable or\ndangerous and each was sharply cut, as though sheared from its neighbor\nby some gigantic curved blade. Dorothy sobbed with relief in Seaton's\narms as Crane, with one arm around his wife, grasped his hand.\n\n\"That was flawless, Dick. As an exhibition of perfect co-ordination and\ninstantaneous timing under extreme physical difficulties, I have never\nseen its equal.\"\n\n\"You certainly saved all our lives,\" Margaret added.\n\n\"Only fifty-fifty, Peg,\" Seaton protested, and blushed vividly. \"Mart\ndid most of it, you know. I'd have gummed up everything back there if he\nhad let me. Let's see what we can find out about them.\"\n\nHe touched the lever and the _Skylark_ moved slowly toward the wreckage,\nthe scattered fragments of which were beginning to move toward and\naround each other because of their mutual gravitational forces. Snapping\non a searchlight, he swung its beam around, and as it settled upon one\nof the larger sections he saw a group of hooded figures; some of them\nupon the metal, others floating slowly toward it through space.\n\n\"Poor devils--they didn't have a chance,\" he remarked regretfully.\n\"However, it was either they or we--look out! Sweet spirits of niter!\"\n\nHe leaped back to the controls and the others were hurled bodily to the\nfloor as he applied the power--for at a signal each of the hooded\nfigures had leveled a tube and once more the outer screen had flamed\ninto incandescence.\n\nAs the _Skylark_ leaped away, Seaton focussed an attractor upon the one\nwho had apparently signaled the attack. Rolling the vessel over in a\nshort loop, so that the captive was hurled off into space upon the other\nside, he snatched the tube from the figure's grasp with one auxiliary\nattractor, and anchored head and limbs with others, so that the prisoner\ncould scarcely move a muscle. Then, while Crane and the women scrambled\nup off the floor and hurried to the visiplates, Seaton cut in rays six,\ntwo-seven, and five-eight. Ray six, \"the softener,\" was a band of\nfrequencies extending from violet far up into the ultra-violet. When\ndriven with sufficient power, this ray destroyed eyesight and nervous\ntissue, and its power increased still further, actually loosened the\nmolecular structure of matter. Ray two-seven was operated in a range of\nfrequencies far below the visible red. It was pure heat--under its\naction matter became hotter and hotter as long as it was applied, the\nupper limit being only the theoretical maximum of temperature. Ray\nfive-eight was high-tension, high-frequency alternating current. Any\nconductor in its path behaved precisely as it would in the Ajax-Northrup\ninduction furnace, which can boil platinum in ten seconds! These three\nrays composed the beam which Seaton directed upon the mass of metal from\nwhich the enemy had elected to continue the battle--and behind each ray,\ninstead of the small energy at the command of its Osnomian inventor,\nwere the untold millions of kilowatts developed by a one-hundred-pound\nbar of disintegrating copper!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere ensued a brief but appalling demonstration of the terrible\neffectiveness of those Osnomian weapons against anything not protected\nby ultra-powered ray screens. Metal and men--if men they were--literally\nvanished. One moment they were outlined starkly in the beam; there was a\nmoment of searing, coruscating, blinding light--the next moment the beam\nbored on into the void, unimpeded. Nothing was visible save an\noccasional tiny flash, as some condensed or solidified droplet of the\nvolatilized metal re-entered the path of that ravening beam.\n\n\"We'll see if there's any more of them loose,\" Seaton remarked, as he\nshut off the force and probed into the wreckage with a searchlight.\n\nNo sign of life or of activity was revealed, and the light was turned\nupon the captive. He was held motionless in the invisible grip of the\nattractors, at the point where the force of those peculiar magnets was\nexactly balanced by the outward thrust of the repellers. By manipulating\nthe attractor holding it, Seaton brought the strange tubular weapon into\nthe control-room through a small air-lock in the wall and examined it\ncuriously, but did not touch it.\n\n\"I never heard of a hand-ray before, so I guess I won't play with it\nmuch until after I learn something about it.\"\n\n\"So you have taken a captive?\" asked Margaret. \"What are you going to do\nwith him?\"\n\n\"I'm going to drag him in here and read his mind. He's one of the\nofficers of that ship, I believe, and I'm going to find out how to build\none exactly like it. This old can is now as obsolete as a 1920 flivver,\nand I'm going to make us a later model. How about it, Mart, don't we\nwant something really up-to-date if we're going to keep on\nspace-hopping?\"\n\n\"We certainty do. Those denizens seem to be particularly venomous, and\nwe will not be safe unless we have the most powerful and most efficient\nspace-ship possible. However, that fellow may be dangerous, even now--in\nfact, it is practically certain that he is.\"\n\n\"You chirped it, ace. I'd much rather touch a pound of dry nitrogen\niodide. I've got him spread-eagled so that he can't destroy his brain\nuntil after we've read it, though, so there's no particular hurry about\nhim. We'll leave him out there for a while, to waste his sweetness on\nthe desert air. Let's all look around for the _Kondal_. I sure hope they\ndidn't get her in that fracas.\"\n\nThey diffused the rays of eight giant searchlights into a vertical fan,\nand with it swept slowly through almost a semi-circle before anything\nwas seen. Then there was revealed a cluster of cylindrical objects amid\na mass of wreckage, which Crane recognized at once.\n\n\"The _Kondal_ is gone, Dick. There is what is left of her, and most of\nher cargo of salt, in jute bags.\"\n\nAs he spoke, a series of green flashes played upon the bags, and Seaton\nyelled in relief.\n\n\"They got the ship all right, but Dunark and Sitar got away--they're\nstill with their salt!\"\n\nThe _Skylark_ moved over to the wreck and Seaton, relinquishing the\ncontrols to Crane, donned a vacuum suit, entered the main air-lock and\nsnapped on the motor which sealed off the lock, pumped the air into a\npressure-tank, and opened the outside door. He threw a light line to the\ntwo figures and pushed himself lightly toward them. He then talked\nbriefly to Dunark in the hand-language, and handed the end of the line\nto Sitar, who held it while the two men explored the fragments of the\nstrange vessel, gathering up various things of interest as they came\nupon them.\n\nBack in the control-room, Dunark and Sitar let their pressure decrease\ngradually to that of the terrestrial vessel and removed the face-plates\nfrom their helmets.\n\n\"Again, oh Karfedo of Earth, we thank you for our lives,\" Dunark began,\ngasping for breath, when Seaton leaped to the air-gauge with a quick\napology.\n\n\"Never thought of the effect our atmospheric pressure would have on you\ntwo. We can stand yours all right, but you'd pretty nearly pass out on\nours. There, that'll suit you better. Didn't you throw out your zone of\nforce?\"\n\n\"Yes, as soon as I saw that our screens were not going to hold.\" The\nOsnomians' labored breathing became normal as the air-pressure increased\nto a value only a little below that of the dense atmosphere of their\nnative planet. \"I then increased the power of the screens to the extreme\nlimit and opened the zone for a moment to see how the screens would hold\nwith the added power. That instant was enough. In that period a\nconcentrated beam, such as I had no idea could ever be generated, went\nthrough the outer and inner screens as though they were not there,\nthrough the four-foot arenak of the hull, through the entire central\ninstallation, and through the hull on the other side. Sitar and I were\nwearing suits....\"\n\n\"Say, Mart, that's one bet we overlooked. It's a good idea, too--those\nstrangers wore them all the time as regular equipment, apparently. Next\ntime we get into a jam, be sure we do it; they might come in handy.\nExcuse me, Dunark--go ahead.\"\n\n\"We had suits on, so as soon as the ray was shut off, which was almost\ninstantly, I phoned the crew to jump, and we leaped out through the hole\nin the hull. The air rushing out gave us an impetus that carried us\nmany miles out into space, and it required many hours for the slight\nattraction of the mass here to draw us back to it. We just got back a\nfew minutes ago. That air-blast is probably what saved us, as they\ndestroyed our vessel with atomic bombs and hunted down the four men of\nour crew, who stayed comparatively close to the scene. They rayed you\nfor about an hour with the most stupendous beams imaginable--no such\ngenerators have ever been considered possible of construction--but\ncouldn't make any impression upon you. Then they shut off their power\nand stood by, waiting. I wasn't looking at you when you released your\nzone. One moment it was there, and the next, the stranger had been cut\nin pieces. The rest you know.\"\n\n\"We're sure glad you two got away, Dunark. Well, Mart, what say we drag\nthat guy in and give him the once-over?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSeaton swung the attractors holding the prisoner until they were in line\nwith the main air-lock, then reduced the power of the repellers. As he\napproached the lock various controls were actuated, and soon the\nstranger stood in the control room, held immovable against one wall,\nwhile Crane, with a 0.50-caliber elephant gun, stood against the other.\n\n\"Perhaps you girls should go somewhere else,\" suggested Crane.\n\n\"Not on your life!\" protested Dorothy, who, eyes wide and flushed with\nexcitement, stood near a door, with a heavy automatic pistol in her\nhand. \"I wouldn't miss this for a farm!\"\n\n\"Got him solid,\" declared Seaton, after a careful inspection of the\nvarious attractors and repellers he had bearing upon the prisoner, \"Now\nlet's get him out of that suit. No--better read his air first,\ntemperature and pressure--might analyze it, too.\"\n\nNothing could be seen of the person of the stranger, since he was\nencased in vacuum armor, but it was plainly evident that he was very\nshort and immensely broad and thick. By means of hollow needles forced\nthrough the leather-like material of the suit Seaton drew off a sample\nof the atmosphere within, into an Orsat apparatus, while Crane made\npressure and temperature readings.\n\n\"Temperature, one hundred ten degrees. Pressure, twenty-eight\npounds--about the same as ours is, now that we have stepped it up to\nkeep the Osnomians from suffering.\"\n\nSeaton soon reported that the atmosphere was quite similar to that of\nthe _Skylark_, except that it was much higher in carbon dioxide and\ncarried an extremely high percentage of water vapor. He took up a pair\nof heavy shears and laid the suit open full length, on both sides,\nknowing that the powerful attractors would hold the stranger immovable.\nHe then wrenched off the helmet and cast the whole suit aside, revealing\nthe enemy officer, clad in a tunic of scarlet silk.\n\nHe was less than five feet tall. His legs were merely blocks, fully as\ngreat in diameter as they were in length, supporting a torso of\nHerculean dimensions. His arms were as large as a strong man's thigh and\nhung almost to the floor. His astounding shoulders, fully a yard across,\nmerged into and supported an enormous head. The being possessed\nrecognizable nose, ears, and mouth; and the great domed forehead and\nhuge cranium bespoke an immense and a highly developed brain.\n\nBut it was the eyes of this strange creature that fixed and held the\nattention. Large they were, and black--the dull, opaque, lusterless\nblack of platinum sponge. The pupils were a brighter black, and in them\nflamed ruby lights: pitiless, mocking, cold. Plainly to be read in those\nsinister depths were the untold wisdom of unthinkable age, sheer\nruthlessness, mighty power, and ferocity unrelieved. His baleful gaze\nswept from one member of the party to another, and to meet the glare of\nthose eyes was to receive a tangible physical blow--it was actually\nponderable force; that of embodied hardness and of ruthlessness\nincarnate, generated in that merciless brain and hurled forth through\nthose flame-shot, Stygian orbs.\n\n\"If you don't need us for anything, Dick, I think Peggy and I will go\nupstairs,\" Dorothy broke the long silence.\n\n\"Good idea, Dot. This isn't going to be pretty to watch--or to do,\neither, for that matter.\"\n\n\"If I stay here another minute I'll see that thing as long as I live;\nand I might be very ill. Goodbye,\" and heartless and bloodthirsty\nOsnomian though she was, Sitar had gone to join the two Terrestrial\nwomen.\n\n\"I didn't want to say much before the girls, but I want to check a\ncouple of ideas with you two. Don't you think it's a safe bet that this\nbird reported back to his headquarters?\"\n\n\"I have been thinking that very thing,\" Crane spoke gravely, and Dunark\nnodded agreement. \"Any race capable of developing such a vessel as this\nwould almost certainly have developed systems of communication in\nproportion.\"\n\n\"That's the way I doped it out--and that's why I'm going to read his\nmind, if I have to burn out his brain to do it. We've got to know how\nfar away from home he is, whether he has turned in any report about us,\nand all about it. Also, I'm going to get the plans, power, and armament\nof their most modern ships, if he knows them, so that your gang, Dunark,\ncan build us one like them; because the next boat that tackles us will\nbe warned and we won't be able to take it by surprise. We won't stand a\nchance in the _Skylark_. With a ship like theirs, however, we can\nrun--or we can fight, if we have to. Any other ideas, fellows?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs neither Crane nor Dunark had any other suggestions to offer, Seaton\nbrought out the mechanical educator, watching the creature's eyes\nnarrowly. As he placed one headset over that motionless head the captive\nsneered in pure contempt, but when the case was opened and the array of\ntubes and transformers was revealed, that expression disappeared; and\nwhen he added a super-power stage by cutting in a heavy-duty transformer\nand a five-kilowatt transmitting tube, Seaton thought that he saw an\ninstantaneously suppressed flicker of doubt or fear.\n\n\"That headset thing was child's play to him, but he doesn't like the\nlooks of this other stuff at all. I don't blame him a bit--I wouldn't\nlike to be on the receiving end of this hook-up myself. I'm going to put\nhim on the recorder and on the visualizer,\" Seaton continued as he\nconnected spools of wire and tape, lamps, and lenses in an intricate\nsystem and donned a headset. \"I'd hate to have much of that brain in my\nown skull--afraid I'd bite myself. I'm just going to look on, and when I\nsee anything I want, I'll grab it and put it into my own brain. I'm\nstarting off easy, not using the big tube.\"\n\nHe closed several switches, lights flashed, and the wires and tapes\nbegan to feed through the magnets.\n\n\"Well, I've got his language, folks, he seemed to want me to have it.\nIt's got a lot of stuff in it that I can't understand yet, though, so\nguess I'll give him some English.\"\n\nHe changed several connections and the captive spoke, in a profoundly\ndeep bass voice.\n\n\"You may as well discontinue your attempt, for you will gain no\ninformation from me. That machine of yours was out of date with us\nthousands of years ago.\"\n\n\"Save your breath or talk sense,\" said Seaton, coldly. \"I gave you\nEnglish so that you can give me the information I want. You already know\nwhat it is. When you get ready to talk, say so, or throw it on the\nscreen of your own accord. If you don't, I'll put on enough voltage to\nburn your brain out. Remember, I can read your dead brain as well as\nthough it were alive, but I want your thoughts, as well as your\nknowledge, and I'm going to have them. If you give them voluntarily, I\nwill tinker up a lifeboat that you can navigate back to your own world\nand let you go; if you resist I intend getting them anyway and you shall\nnot leave this vessel alive. You may take your choice.\"\n\n\"You are childish, and that machine is impotent against my will. I could\nhave defied it a hundred years ago, when I was barely a grown man. Know\nyou, American, that we supermen of the Fenachrone are as far above any\nof the other and lesser breeds of beings who spawn in their millions in\ntheir countless myriads of races upon the numberless planets of the\nUniverse as you are above the inert metal from which this, your ship,\nwas built. The Universe is ours, and in due course we shall take\nit--just as in due course I shall take this vessel. Do your worst; I\nshall not speak.\" The creature's eyes flamed, hurling a wave of hypnotic\ncommand through Seaton's eyes and deep into his brain. Seaton's very\nsenses reeled for an instant under the impact of that awful mental\nforce; but after a short, intensely bitter struggle he threw off the\nspell.\n\n\"That was close, fellow, but you didn't quite ring the bell,\" he said\ngrimly, staring directly into those unholy eyes. \"I may rate pretty low\nmentally, but I can't be hypnotized into turning you loose. Also I can\ngive you cards and spades in certain other lines which I am about to\ndemonstrate. Being superman didn't keep the rest of your men from going\nout in my ray, and being a superman isn't going to save your brain. I am\nnot depending upon my intellectual or mental force--I've got an ace in\nthe hole in the shape of five thousand volts to apply to the most\ndelicate centers of your brain. Start giving me what I want, and start\nquick, or I'll tear it out of you.\"\n\nThe giant did not answer, merely glared defiance and bitter hate.\n\n\"Take it, then!\" Seaton snapped, and cut in the super-power stage and\nbegan turning dials and knobs, exploring that strange mind for the\nparticular area in which he was most interested. He soon found it, and\ncut in the visualizer--the stereographic device, in parallel with\nSolon's own brain recorder, which projected a three-dimensional picture\ninto the \"viewing-area\" or dark space of the cabinet. Crane and Dunark,\ntense and silent, looked on in strained suspense as, minute after\nminute, the silent battle of wills raged. Upon one side was a horrible\nand gigantic brain, of undreamed of power; upon the other side a strong\nman, fighting for all that life holds dear, wielding against that\nmonstrous and frightful brain a weapon wrought of high-tension\nelectricity, applied with all the skill that earthly and Osnomian\nscience could devise.\n\nSeaton crouched over the amplifier, his jaw set and every muscle taut,\nhis eyes leaping from one meter to another, his right hand slowly\nturning up the potentiometer which was driving more and ever more of the\nsearing, torturing output of his super-power tube into that stubborn\nbrain. The captive was standing utterly rigid, eyes closed, every sense\nand faculty mustered to resist that cruelly penetrant attack upon the\nvery innermost recesses of his mind. Crane and Dunark scarcely breathed\nas the three-dimensional picture in the visualizer varied from a blank\nto the hazy outlines of a giant space-cruiser. It faded out as the\nunknown exerted himself to withstand that poignant inquisition, only to\ncome back in, clearer than before, as Seaton advanced the potentiometer\nstill farther. Finally, flesh and blood could no longer resist that\nlethal probe and the picture became sharp and clear. It showed the\ncaptain--for he was no less an officer than the commander of the\nvessel--at a great council table, seated, together with many other\nofficers, upon very low, enormously strong metal stools. They were\nreceiving orders from their Emperor; orders plainly understood by Crane\nand the Osnomian alike, for thought needs no translation.\n\n\"Gentlemen of the Navy,\" the ruler spoke solemnly, \"Our preliminary\nexpedition, returned some time ago, achieved its every aim, and we are\nnow ready to begin fulfilling our destiny, the Conquest of the Universe.\nThis Galaxy comes first. Our base of operations will be the largest\nplanet of that group of brilliant green suns, for they can be seen from\nany point in the Galaxy and are almost in the exact center of it. Our\nastronomers,\" here the captain's thoughts shifted briefly to an\nobservatory far out in space for perfect seeing, and portrayed a\nreflecting telescope with a mirror five miles in diameter, capable of\npenetrating unimaginable myriads of light-years into space, \"have\ntabulated all the suns, planets, and satellites belonging to this\nGalaxy, and each of you has been given a complete chart and assigned a\ncertain area which he is to explore. Remember, gentlemen, that this\nfirst major expedition is to be purely one of exploration; the one of\nconquest will set out after you have returned with complete information.\nYou will each report by torpedo every tenth of the year. We do not\nanticipate any serious difficulty, as we are of course the highest type\nof life in the Universe; nevertheless, in the unlikely event of trouble,\nreport it. We shall do the rest. In conclusion, I warn you again--let no\npeople know that we exist. Make no conquests, and destroy all who by any\nchance may see you. Gentlemen, go with power.\"\n\nThe captain embarked in a small airboat and was shot to his vessel. He\ntook his station at an immense control board and the warship shot off\ninstantly, with unthinkable velocity, and with not the slightest\nphysical shock.\n\nAt this point Seaton made the captain take them all over the ship. They\nnoted its construction, its power-plant, its controls--every minute\ndetail of structure, operation, and maintenance was taken from the\ncaptain's mind and was both recorded and visualized.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe journey seemed to be a very long one, but finally the cluster of\ngreen suns became visible and the Fenachrone began to explore the solar\nsystems in the area assigned to that particular vessel. Hardly had the\nsurvey started, however, when the two globular space-cruisers were\ndetected and located. The captain stopped the ship briefly, then\nattacked. They watched the attack, and saw the destruction of the\n_Kondal_. They looked on while the captain read the brain of one of\nDunark's crew, gleaning from it all the facts concerning the two\nspace-ships, and thought with him that the two absentees from the\n_Kondal_ would drift back in a few hours, and would be disposed of in\ndue course. They learned that these things were automatically impressed\nupon the torpedo next to issue, as was every detail of everything that\nhappened in and around the vessel. They watched him impress a thought of\nhis own upon the record--\"the inhabitants of planet three of sun six\nfour seven three Pilarone show unusual development and may cause\ntrouble, as they have already brought knowledge of the metal of power\nand of the impenetrable shield to the Central System, which is to be our\nbase. Recommend volatilization of this planet by vessel sent on special\nmission.\" They saw the raying of the _Skylark_. They sensed him issue\ncommands:\n\n\"Ray it for a time; he will probably open the shield for a moment, as\nthe other one did,\" then, after a time skipped over by the mind under\nexamination. \"Cease raying--no use wasting power. He must open\neventually, as he runs out of power. Stand by and destroy him when he\nopens.\"\n\nThe scene shifted. The captain was asleep and was awakened by an alarm\ngong--only to find himself floating in a mass of wreckage. Making his\nway to the fragment of his vessel containing the torpedo port, he\nreleased the messenger, which flew, with ever-increasing velocity, back\nto the capital city of the Fenachrone, carrying with it a record of\neverything that had happened.\n\n\"That's what I want,\" thought Seaton. \"Those torpedoes went home, fast.\nI want to know how far they have to go and how long it'll take them to\nget there. You know what distance a parsec is, since it is purely a\nmathematical concept; and you must have a watch or some similar\ninstrument with which we can translate your years into ours. I don't\nwant to have to kill you, fellow, and if you'll give up even now I'll\nspare you. I'll get it anyway, you know--and you also know that a few\nhundred volts more will kill you.\"\n\nThey saw the thought received, and saw its answer: \"You shall learn no\nmore. This is the most important of all, and I shall hold it to\ndisintegration and beyond.\"\n\nSeaton advanced the potentiometer still farther, and the brain picture\nwaxed and waned, strengthened and faded. Finally, however, it was\nrevealed by flashes that the torpedo had about a hundred and fifty-five\nthousand parsecs to go and that it would take two-tenths of a year to\nmake the journey; that the warships which would come in answer to the\nmessage were as fast as the torpedo; that he did indeed have in his suit\na watch--a device of seven dials, each turning ten times as fast as its\nsuccessor; and that one turn of the slowest dial measured one year of\nhis time. Seaton instantly threw off his headset and opened the power\nswitch.\n\n\"Grab a stopwatch quick, Mart!\" he called, as he leaped to the discarded\nvacuum suit and searched out the peculiar timepiece. They noted the\nexact time consumed by one complete revolution of one of the dials, and\ncalculated rapidly.\n\n\"Better than I thought!\" exclaimed Seaton. \"That makes his year about\nfour hundred ten of our days. That gives us eighty-two days before the\ntorpedo gets there--longer than I'd dared hope. We've got to fight, too,\nnot run. They figure on getting the _Skylark_, then volatilizing our\nworld. Well, we can take time enough to grab off an absolutely complete\nrecord of this guy's brain. We'll need it for what's coming, and I'm\ngoing to get it, if I have to kill him to do it.\"\n\nHe resumed his place at the educator, turned on the power, and a shadow\npassed over his face.\n\n\"Poor devil, he's conked out--couldn't stand the gaff,\" he remarked,\nhalf-regretfully. \"However that makes it easy to get what we want, and\nwe'd have had to kill him anyway, I guess--Bad as it is, I'd hate to\nbump him off in cold blood.\"\n\nHe threaded new spools into the machine, and for three hours, mile after\nmile of tape sped between the magnets as Seaton explored every recess of\nthat monstrous, yet stupendous brain.\n\n\"Well, that's that,\" he declared finally, as, the last bit of\ninformation gleaned and recorded upon the flying tape, he removed the\nbody of the Fenachrone captain into space and rayed it out of existence.\n\"Now what to do?\"\n\n\"How can we get this salt to Osnome?\" asked Dunark whose thoughts were\nnever far from that store of the precious chemical. \"You are already\ncrowded, and Sitar and I will crowd you still more. You have no room for\nadditional cargo, and yet much valuable time would be lost in going to\nOsnome for another vessel.\"\n\n\"Yes, and we've got to get a lot of 'X', too. Guess we'll have to take\ntime to get another vessel. I'd like to drag in the pieces of that ship,\ntoo--his instruments and a lot of the parts could be used.\"\n\n\"Why not do it all at once?\" suggested Crane. \"We can start that whole\nmass toward Osnome by drawing it behind us until such a velocity has\nbeen attained that it will reach there at the desired time. We could\nthen go to 'X,' and overtake this material near the green system.\"\n\n\"Right you are, ace--that's a sound idea. But say, Dunark, it wouldn't\nbe good technique for you to eat our food for any length of time. While\nwe're figuring this out you'd better hop over there and bring over\nenough to last you two until we get you home. Give it to Shiro--after a\ncouple of lessons, you'll find he'll be as good as any of your cooks.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFaster and faster the _Skylark_ flew, pulling behind her the mass of\nwreckage, held by every available attractor. When the calculated\nvelocity had been attained, the attractors were shut off and the vessel\ndarted away toward that planet, still in the Carboniferous Age, which\npossessed at least one solid ledge of metallic \"X,\" the rarest of all\nearthly metals. As the automatic controls held the cruiser upon her\ncourse, the six wanderers sat long in discussion as to what should be\ndone, what could be done, to avert the threatened destruction of all the\ncivilization of the Galaxy except the monstrous and unspeakable culture\nof the Fenachrone. Nearing their destination, Seaton rose to his feet.\n\n\"Well, folks, it's like this. We've got our backs to the wall. Dunark\nhas troubles of his own--if the Third Planet doesn't get him the\nFenachrone will, and the Third Planet is the more pressing danger. That\nlets him out. We've got nearly six months before the Fenachrone can get\nback here....\"\n\n\"But how can they possibly find us here, or wherever we'll be by that\ntime, Dick?\" asked Dorothy. \"The battle was a long way from here.\"\n\n\"With that much start they probably couldn't find us,\" Seaton replied\nsoberly. \"It's the world I'm thinking about. They've got to be stopped,\nand stopped cold--and we've got only six months to do it in.... Osnome's\ngot the best tools and the fastest workmen I know of....\" his voice died\naway in thought.\n\n\"That sort of thing is in your department, Dick.\"\n\nCrane was calm and judicial as always. \"I will, of course, do anything I\ncan. But you probably have a plan of campaign already laid out?\"\n\n\"After a fashion. We've got to find out how to work through this zone of\nforce or we're sunk without a trace. Even with rays, screens, and ships\nequal to theirs, we couldn't keep them from sending a vessel to destroy\nthe earth; and they'd probably get us too, eventually. They've got a lot\nof stuff we don't know about, of course, since I took only one man's\nmind. While he was a very able man, he didn't know all that all the rest\nof them do, any more than any one man has all the earthly science known.\nAbsolutely our only chance is to control that zone--it's the only thing\nthey haven't got. Of course, it may be impossible, but I won't believe\nthat, until I've exhausted a lot of possibilities. Dunark, can you spare\na crew to build us a duplicate of that Fenachrone ship, besides those\nyou are going to build for yourself?\"\n\n\"Certainly. I will be only too glad to do so.\"\n\n\"Well, then, while Dunark is doing that, I suggest that we go to this\nThird Planet, abduct a few of their leading scientists, and read their\nminds. Then do the same, visiting every other highly advanced planet we\ncan locate. There is a good chance that, by combining the best points of\nthe warfares of many worlds, we can evolve something that will enable us\nto turn back these invaders.\"\n\n\"Why not send a copper torpedo to destroy their entire planet?\"\nsuggested Dunark.\n\n\"Wouldn't work. Their detecting screens would locate it a thousand\nmillion miles off in space, and they would ray it. With a zone of force\nthat would get through their screens, that would be the first thing I'd\ndo. You see, every thought comes back to that zone. We've got to get\nthrough it some way.\"\n\nThe course alarm sounded, and they saw that a planet lay directly in\ntheir path. It was \"X,\" and enough negative acceleration was applied to\nmake an easy landing possible.\n\n\"Isn't it going to be a long, slow job, chopping off two tons of that\nmetal and fighting away those terrible animals besides?\" asked Margaret.\n\n\"It'll take about a millionth of a second, Peg. I'm going to bite it off\nwith the zone, just as I took that bite out of our field. The rotation\nof the planet will throw us away from the surface, then we'll release\nthe zone and drag our prey off with us. See?\"\n\nThe _Skylark_ descended rapidly toward that well-remembered ledge of\nmetal to which the object compass had led them.\n\n\"This is exactly where we landed before,\" Margaret commented in\nsurprise, and Dorothy added:\n\n\"Yes, and there's that horrible tree that ate the dinosaur or whatever\nit was. I thought you blew it up for me, Dick?\"\n\n\"I did, Dottie--blew it into atoms. Must be a good location for\ncarnivorous trees--and they must grow awfully fast, too. As to its being\nthe same place, Peg--sure it is. That's what object compasses are for.\"\n\nEverything appeared as it had been at the time of their first visit. The\nrank Carboniferous vegetation, intensely, vividly green, was motionless\nin the still, hot, heavy air; the living nightmares inhabiting that\nprimitive world were lying in the cooler depths of the jungle, sheltered\nfrom the torrid rays of that strange and fervent sun.\n\n\"How about it, Dot? Want to see some of your little friends again? If\nyou do, I'll give them a shot and bring them out.\"\n\n\"Heavens, no! I saw them once--if I never see them again, that will be\ntwenty minutes too soon!\"\n\n\"All right--we'll grab us a piece of this ledge and beat it.\"\n\nSeaton lowered the vessel to the ledge, focussed the main anchoring\nattractor upon it, and threw on the zone of force. Almost immediately he\nreleased the zone, pointed the bar parallel to the compass bearing upon\nOsnome, and slowly applied the power.\n\n\"How much did you take, anyway?\" asked Dunark in amazement. \"It looks\nbigger than the _Skylark_!\"\n\n\"It is; considerably bigger. Thought we might as well take enough while\nwe're here, so I set the zone for a seventy-five-foot radius. It's\nprobably of the order of magnitude of half a million tons, since the\nstuff weighs more than half a ton to the cubic foot. However, we can\nhandle it as easily as we could a smaller bite, and that much mass will\nhelp us hold that other stuff together when we catch up with it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe voyage to Osnome was uneventful. They overtook the wreckage, true to\nschedule, as they were approaching the green system, and attached it to\nthe mass of metal behind them by means of attractors.\n\n\"Where'll we land this junk, Dunark?\" asked Seaton, as Osnome grew large\nbeneath them. \"We'll hold this lump of metal and the fragment of the\nship carrying the salt; and we'll be able to hold some of the most\nimportant of the other stuff. But a lot of it is bound to get away from\nus--and the Lord help anybody who's under it when it comes down! You\nmight yell for help--and say, you might ask somebody to have that\nastronomical data ready for us as soon as we land.\"\n\n\"The parade ground will be empty now, so we will land there,\" Dunark\nreplied. \"We should be able to land everything in a field of that size,\nI should think.\" He touched the sender at his belt, and in the general\ncode notified the city of their arrival and warned everyone to keep away\nfrom the parade ground. He then sent several messages in the official\ncode, concluding by asking that one or two space-ships come out and help\nlower the burden to the ground. As the peculiar, pulsating chatter of\nthe Osnomian telegraph died out, Seaton called for help.\n\n\"Come here, you two, and grab some of these attractors. I need about\ntwelve hands to keep this plunder in the straight and narrow path.\"\n\nThe course had been carefully laid, with allowance for the various\nvelocities and forces involved, to follow the easiest path to the\nKondalian parade ground. The hemisphere of \"X\" and the fragment of the\n_Kondal_ which bore the salt were held immovably in place by the main\nattractor and one auxiliary; and many other auxiliaries held sections of\nthe Fenachrone vessel. However, the resistance of the air seriously\naffected the trajectory of many of the irregularly shaped smaller masses\nof metal, and all three men were kept busy flicking attractors right and\nleft; capturing those strays which threatened to veer off into the\nstreets or upon the buildings of the Kondalian capital city, and\nshifting from one piece to another so that none should fall freely. Two\nsister-ships of the _Kondal_ appeared as if by magic in answer to\nDunark's call, and their attractors aided greatly in handling the unruly\ncollection of wreckage. A few of the smaller sections and a shower of\ndebris fell clear, however, in spite of all efforts, and their approach\nwas heralded by a meteoric display unprecedented in that world of\ncontinuous daylight.\n\nAs the three vessels with their cumbersome convoy dropped down into the\nlower atmosphere, the guns of the city roared a welcome; banners and\npennons waved; the air became riotous with color from hundreds of\nprojectors and odorous with a bewildering variety of scents; while all\naround them played numberless aircraft of all descriptions and sizes.\nThe space below them was carefully avoided, but on all sides and above\nthem the air was so full that it seemed marvelous that no collision\noccurred. Tiny one-man helicopters, little more than single chairs\nflying about; beautiful pleasure-planes, soaring and wheeling; immense\nmultiplane liners and giant helicopter freighters--everything in the air\nfound occasion to fly as near as possible to the Skylark in order to dip\ntheir flags in salute to Dunark, their Kofedix, and to Seaton, the\nwearer of the seven disks--their revered Overlord.\n\nFinally the freight was landed without serious mishap and the _Skylark_\nleaped to the landing dock upon the palace roof, where the royal family\nand many nobles were waiting, in full panoply of glittering harness.\nDunark and Sitar disembarked and the four others stepped out and stood\nat attention as Seaton addressed Roban, the Karfedix.\n\n\"Sir, we greet you, but we cannot stop, even for a moment. You know that\nonly the most urgent necessity would make us forego the pleasure of a\nbrief rest beneath your roof--the Kofedix will presently give you the\nmeasure of that dire need. We shall endeavor to return soon. Greetings,\nand, for a time, farewell.\"\n\n\"Overlord, we greet you, and trust that soon we may entertain you and\nprofit from your companionship. For what you have done, we thank you.\nMay the great First Cause smile upon you until your return. Farewell.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nThe Peace Conference\n\n\n\"Here's a chart of the green system, Mart, with all the motions and the\nrest of the dope that they've been able to get. How'd it be for you to\nnavigate us over to the third planet of the fourteenth sun?\"\n\n\"While you build a Fenachrone super-generator?\"\n\n\"Right, the first time. Your deducer is hitting on all eight, as usual.\nThat big ray is hot stuff, and their ray-screen is something to write\nhome about, too.\"\n\n\"How can their rays be any hotter than ours, Dick?\" Dorothy asked\ncuriously. \"I thought you said we had the very last word in rays.\"\n\n\"I thought we had, but those birds we met back there spoke a couple of\nlater words. Their rays work on an entirely different system than the\none we use. They generate an extremely short carrier wave, like the\nMillikan cosmic ray, by recombining some of the electrons and protons of\ntheir disintegrating metal, and upon this wave they impose a pure heat\nfrequency of terrific power. The Millikan rays will penetrate anything\nexcept a special ray screen or a zone of force, and carry with\nthem--somewhat as radio frequencies carry sound frequencies--the heat\nrays, which volatilize anything they touch. Their ray screens are a lot\nbetter than ours, too--they generate the entire spectrum. It's a sweet\nsystem and when we revamp ours so as to be just like it, we'll be able\nto talk turkey to those folks on the third planet.\"\n\n\"How long will it take you to build it?\" asked Crane, who, dexterously\nturning the pages of \"Vega's Handbuch\" was calculating their course.\n\n\"A day or so--maybe less. I've got all the stuff and with my Osnomian\ntools it won't take long. If you find you'll get there before I get\ndone, you'll have to loaf a while--kill a little time.\"\n\n\"Are you going to connect the power plant to operate on the entire\nvessel and all its contents?\"\n\n\"No--can't do it without redesigning the whole thing and that's hardly\nworth while for the short time we'll use this old bus.\"\n\nBuilding those generators would have been a long and difficult task for\na corps of earthly mechanics and electricians, but to Seaton it was\nmerely a job. The \"shop\" had been enlarged and had been filled to\ncapacity with Osnomian machinery; machine tools that were capable of\nperforming automatically and with the utmost precision and speed any\nconceivable mechanical operation. He put a dozen of them to work, and\nbefore the vessel reached its destination, the new offensive and\ndefensive weapons had been installed and thoroughly tested. He had added\na third screen-generator, so that now, in addition to the four-foot hull\nof arenak and the repellers, warding off any material projectile, the\nSkylark was also protected by an outer, an intermediate, and an inner\nray-screen; each driven by the super-power of a four-hundred-pound bar\nand each covering the entire spectrum--capable of neutralizing any\ndangerous frequency known to those master-scientists, the Fenachrone.\n\nAs the _Skylark_ approached the planet, Seaton swung number six\nvisiplate upon it, and directed their flight toward a great army base.\nDarting down upon it, he snatched an officer into the airlock, closed\nthe door, and leaped back into space. He brought the captive into the\ncontrol room pinioned by auxiliary attractors, and relieved him of his\nweapons. He then rapidly read his mind, encountering no noticeable\nresistance, released the attractors, and addressed him in his own\nlanguage.\n\n\"Please be seated, lieutenant,\" Seaton said courteously, motioning him\nto one of the seats. \"We come in peace. Please pardon my discourtesy in\nhandling you, but it was necessary in order to learn your language and\nthus to get in touch with your commanding officer.\"\n\nThe officer, overcome with astonishment that he had not been killed\ninstantly, sank into the seat indicated, without a reply, and Seaton\nwent on:\n\n\"Please be kind enough to signal your commanding officer that we are\ncoming down at once, for a peace conference. By the way, I can read your\nsignals, and will send them myself if necessary.\"\n\nThe stranger worked an instrument attached to his harness briefly, and\nthe _Skylark_ descended slowly toward the fortress.\n\n\"I know, of course, that your vessels will attack,\" Seaton remarked, as\nhe noted a crafty gleam in the eyes of the officer. \"I intend to let\nthem use all their power for a time, to prove to them the impotence of\ntheir weapons. After that, I shall tell you what to say to them.\"\n\n\"Do you think this is altogether safe, Dick?\" asked Crane as they saw a\nfleet of gigantic airships soaring upward to meet them.\n\n\"Nothing sure but death and taxes,\" returned Seaton cheerfully, \"but\ndon't forget that we've got Fenachrone armament now, instead of\nOsnomian. I'm betting that they can't begin to drive their rays through\neven our outer screen. And even if our outer screen should begin to go\ninto the violet--I don't think it will even go cherry-red--out goes our\nzone of force and we automatically go up where no possible airship can\nreach. Since their only space-ships are rocket driven, and of\npractically no maneuverability, they stand a big chance of getting to\nus. Anyway, we must get in touch with them, to find out if they know\nanything we don't, and this is the only way I know of to do it. Besides,\nI want to head Dunark off from wrecking this world. They're exactly the\nsame kind of folks he is, you notice, and I don't like civil war. Any\nsuggestions? Keep an eye on that bird, then, Mart, and we'll go down.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe _Skylark_ dropped down into the midst of the fleet, which instantly\nturned against her the full force of their giant guns and their immense\nray batteries. Seaton held the _Skylark_ motionless, staring into his\nvisiplate, his right hand grasping the zone-switch.\n\n\"The outer screen isn't even getting warm!\" he exulted after a moment.\nThe repellers were hurling the shells back long before they reached even\nthe outer screen, and they were exploding harmlessly in the air. The\nfull power of the ray-generators, too, which had been so destructive to\nthe Osnomian defenses, were only sufficient to bring the outer screen to\na dull red glow. After fifteen minutes of passive acceptance of all the\nairships could do, Seaton spoke to the captive.\n\n\"Sir, please signal the commanding officer of vessel seven-two-four that\nI am going to cut it in two in the middle. Have him remove all men in\nthat part of the ship to the ends, and have parachutes in readiness, as\nI do not wish to cause any loss of life.\"\n\nThe signal was sent, and, as the officer was already daunted by the fact\nthat their utmost efforts could not even make the strangers' screens\nradiate, it was obeyed. Seaton then threw on the frightful power of the\nFenachrone super-generators. The defensive screens of the doomed warship\nflashed once--a sparkling, coruscating display of incandescent\nbrilliance--and in the same instant went down. Simultaneously the entire\nmidsection of the vessel exploded into light and disappeared; completely\nvolatilized.\n\n\"Sir, please signal the entire fleet to cease action, and to follow me\ndown. If they do not do so, I will destroy the rest of them.\"\n\nThe _Skylark_ dropped to the ground, followed by the fleet of warships,\nwho settled in a ring about her--inactive, but ready.\n\n\"Will you please loan me your sending instrument, sir?\" Seaton asked.\n\"From this point on I can carry on negotiations better direct than\nthrough you.\"\n\nThe lieutenant found his voice as he surrendered the instrument.\n\n\"Sir, are you the Overlord of Osnome, of whom we have heard? We had\nsupposed that one was a mythical character, but you must be he--no one\nelse would spare lives that he could take, and the Overlord is the only\nbeing reputed to have a skin the color of yours.\"\n\n\"Yes, lieutenant, I am the Overlord--and I have decided to become the\nOverlord of the entire green system, as well as of Osnome.\"\n\nHe then sent out a call to the commander-in-chief of all the armies of\nthe planet, informing him that he was coming to visit him at once, and\nthe _Skylark_ tore through the air to the capital city. No sooner had\nthe earthly vessel alighted upon the palace grounds than she was\nsurrounded by a ring of warships who, however, made no offensive move.\nSeaton again used the telegraph.\n\n\"Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces of the planet Urvania; greetings\nfrom the Overlord of this solar system. I invite you to come into my\nvessel, unarmed and alone, for a conference. I come in peace and, peace\nor war as you decide, no harm shall come to you, until after you have\nreturned to your own command. Think well before you reply.\"\n\n\"If I refuse?\"\n\n\"I shall destroy one of the vessels surrounding me, and shall continue\nto destroy them, one every ten seconds, until you agree to come. If you\nstill do not agree. I shall destroy all the armed forces upon this\nplanet, then destroy all your people who are at present upon Osnome. I\nwish to avoid bloodshed and destruction, but I can and I will do as I\nhave said.\"\n\n\"I will come.\"\n\nThe general came out upon the field unarmed, escorted by a company of\nsoldiers. A hundred feet from the vessel he halted the guards and came\non alone, erect and soldierly. Seaton met him at the door and invited\nhim to be seated.\n\n\"What can you have to say to me?\" the general demanded, disregarding the\ninvitation.\n\n\"Many things. First, let me say that you are not only a brave man; you\nare a wise general--your visit to me proves it.\"\n\n\"It is a sign of weakness, but I believed when I heard those reports,\nand still believe, that a refusal would have resulted in a heavy loss of\nour men,\" was the General's reply.\n\n\"It would have,\" said Seaton. \"I repeat that your act was not weakness,\nbut wisdom. The second thing I have to say is that I had not planned on\ntaking any active part in the management of things, either upon Osnome\nor upon this planet, until I learned of a catastrophe that is\nthreatening all the civilization in this Galaxy--thus threatening my own\ndistant world as well as those of this solar system. Third, only by\nsuperior force can I make either your race or the Osnomians listen to\nreason sufficiently to unite against a common foe. You have been reared\nin unreasoning hatred for so many generations that your minds are\nwarped. For that reason I have assumed control of this entire system,\nand shall give you your choice between co-operating with us or being\nrendered incapable of molesting us while our attention is occupied by\nthis threatened invasion.\"\n\n\"We will have no traffic with the enemy whatever,\" said the general.\n\"This is final.\"\n\n\"You just think so. Here is a mathematical statement of what is going\nto happen to your world, unless I intervene.\" He handed the general a\ndrawing of Dunark's plan and described it in detail. \"That is the answer\nof the Osnomians to your invasion of their planet. I do not want this\nworld destroyed, but if you refuse to make common cause with us against\na common foe, it may be necessary. Have you forces at your command\nsufficient to frustrate this plan?\"\n\n\"No; but I cannot really believe that such a deflection of celestial\nbodies is possible. Possible or not, you realize that I could not yield\nto empty threats.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" said Seaton, \"but you were wise enough to refuse to\nsacrifice a few ships and men in a useless struggle against my\noverwhelming armament, therefore you are certainly wise enough to refuse\nto sacrifice your entire race. However, before you come to any definite\nconclusion, I will show you what threatens the Galaxy.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe handed the other a headset and ran through the section of the record\nshowing the plans of the invaders. He then ran a few sections showing\nthe irresistible power at the command of the Fenachrone.\n\n\"That is what awaits us all unless we combine against them.\"\n\n\"What are your requirements?\" the general asked.\n\n\"I request immediate withdrawal of all your armed forces now upon Osnome\nand full co-operation with me in this coming war against the invaders.\nIn return, I will give you the secrets I have just given the\nOsnomians--the power and the offensive and defensive weapons of this\nvessel.\"\n\n\"The Osnomians are now building vessels such as this one?\" asked the\ngeneral.\n\n\"They are building vessels a hundred times the size of this one, with\nthe same armament.\"\n\n\"For myself, I would agree to your terms. However, the word of the\nEmperor is law.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" replied Seaton. \"Would you be willing to seek an\nimmediate audience with him? I would suggest that both you and he\naccompany me, and we shall hold a peace conference with the Osnomian\nEmperor and Commander-in-Chief upon this vessel. We shall be gone less\nthan a day.\"\n\n\"I shall do so at once.\"\n\n\"You may accompany your general, lieutenant. Again I ask pardon for my\nnecessary rudeness.\"\n\nAs the Urvanian officers hurried toward the palace, the other\nTerrestrials, who had been listening in from another room, entered.\n\n\"It sounded as though you convinced him, Dick; but that language is\nnothing like Kondalian. Why don't you teach it to us? Teach it to Shiro,\ntoo, so he can cook for, and talk to, our distinguished guests\nintelligently, if they're going back with us.\"\n\nAs he connected up the educator, Seaton explained what had happened, and\nconcluded:\n\n\"I want to stop this civil war, keep Dunark from destroying this planet,\npreserve Osnome for Osnomians, and make them all co-operate with us\nagainst the Fenachrone. That's one tall order, since these folks haven't\nthe remotest notion of anything except killing.\"\n\nA company of soldiers approached, and Dorothy got up hastily.\n\n\"Stick around, folks. We can all talk to them.\"\n\n\"I believe that it would be better for you to be alone,\" Crane decided,\nafter a moment's thought. \"They are used to autocratic power, and can\nunderstand nothing but one-man control. The girls and I will keep out of\nit.\"\n\n\"That might be better at that,\" and Seaton went to the door to welcome\nthe guests. Seaton instructed them to lie flat, and put on all the\nacceleration they could bear. It was not long until they were back in\nKondal, where Roban, the Karfedix, and Tarnan, the Karbix, accepted\nSeaton's invitation and entered the Skylark, unarmed. Back out in space,\nthe vessel stationary, Seaton introduced the emperors and\ncommanders-in-chief to each other--introductions which were acknowledged\nalmost imperceptibly. He then gave each a headset, and ran the complete\nrecord of the Fenachrone brain.\n\n\"Stop!\" shouted Roban, after only a moment. \"Would you, the Overlord of\nOsnome, reveal such secrets as this to the arch-enemies of Osnome?\"\n\n\"I would. I have taken over the Overlordship of the entire green system\nfor the duration of this emergency, and I do not want two of its planets\nengaged in civil war.\"\n\nThe record finished, Seaton tried for some time to bring the four green\nwarriors to his way of thinking, but in vain. Roban and Tarnan remained\ncontemptuous. They would have thrown themselves upon him, but for the\nknowledge that no fifty unarmed men of the green race could have\novercome his strength--to them supernatural. The two Urvanians were\nequally obdurate. This soft earth-being had given them everything; they\nhad given him nothing and would give him nothing. Finally Seaton rose to\nhis full height and stared at them in turn, wrath and determination\nblazing in his eyes.\n\n\"I have brought you four together, here in a neutral vessel in neutral\nspace, to bring about peace between you. I have shown you the benefits\nto be derived from the peaceful pursuit of science, knowledge, and\npower, instead of continuing this utter economic waste of continual war.\nYou all close your senses to reason. You of Osnome accuse me of being an\ningrate and a traitor; you of Urvania consider me a soft-headed,\nsentimental weakling, who may safely be disregarded--all because I think\nthe welfare of the numberless peoples of the Universe more important\nthan your narrow-minded, stubborn, selfish vanity. Think what you\nplease. If brute force is your only logic, know now that I can, and\nwill, use brute force. Here are the seven disks,\" and he placed the\nbracelet upon Roban's knee.\n\n\"If you four leaders are short-sighted enough to place your petty enmity\nbefore the good of all civilization, I am done with you forever. I have\ndeliberately given Urvanians precisely the same information that I have\ngiven the Osnomians--no more and no less. I have given neither of you\nall that I know, and I shall know much more than I do now, before the\ntime of the conquest shall have arrived. Unless you four men, here and\nnow, renounce this war and agree to a perpetual peace between your\nworlds, I shall leave you to your mutual destruction. You do not yet\nrealize the power of the weapons I have given you. When you do realize\nit, you will know that mutual destruction is inevitable if you continue\nthis internecine war. I shall continue upon other worlds my search for\nthe one secret standing between me and a complete mastery of power. That\nI shall find that secret I am confident; and, having found it, I shall,\nwithout your aid, destroy the Fenachrone.\n\n\"You have several times remarked with sneers that you are not to be\nswayed by empty threats. What I am about to say is no empty threat--it\nis a most solemn promise, given by one who has both the will and the\npower to fulfill his every given word. Now listen carefully to this, my\nfinal utterance. If you continue this warfare and if the victor should\nnot be utterly destroyed in its course, I swear as I stand here, by the\ngreat First Cause, that I shall myself wipe out every trace of the\nsurviving nation as soon as the Fenachrone shall have been obliterated.\nWork with each other and me and we all may live--fight on and both your\nnations, to the last person, will most certainly die. Decide now which\nit is to be. I have spoken.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRoban took up the bracelet and clasped it again about Seaton's arm,\nsaying, \"You are more than ever our Overlord. You are wiser than are we,\nand stronger. Issue your commands and they shall be obeyed.\"\n\n\"Why did not you say those things first, Overlord?\" asked the Urvanian\nemperor, as he saluted and smiled. \"We could not in honor submit to a\nweakling, no matter what the fate in store. Having convinced us of your\nstrength, there can be no disgrace in fighting beneath your screens. An\narmlet of seven symbols shall be cast and ready for you when you next\nvisit us. Roban of Osnome, you are my brother.\"\n\nThe two emperors saluted each other and stared eye to eye for a long\nmoment, and Seaton knew that the perpetual peace had been signed. Then\nall four spoke, in unison:\n\n\"Overlord, we await your commands.\"\n\n\"Dunark of Osnome is already informed as to what Osnome is to do. Say to\nhim that it will not be necessary for him to build the vessel for me;\nthe Urvanians will do that. Urvan of Urvania, you will accompany Roban\nto Osnome, where you two will order instant cessation of hostilities.\nOsnome has many ships of this type, and upon some of them you will\nreturn your every soldier and engine of war to your own planet. As soon\nas possible you will build for me a vessel like that of the Fenachrone,\nexcept that it shall be ten times as large, in every dimension, and\nexcept that every instrument, control, and weapon is to be left out.\"\n\n\"Left out? It shall be so built--but of what use will it be?\"\n\n\"The empty spaces shall be filled after I have returned from my quest.\nYou will build this vessel of dagal. You will also instruct the Osnomian\ncommander in the manufacture of that metal, which is so much more\nresistant than their arenak.\"\n\n\"But, Overlord, we have....\"\n\n\"I have just brought immense stores of the precious chemical and of the\nmetal of power to Osnome. They will share it with you. I also advise you\nto build for yourselves many ships like those of the Fenachrone, with\nwhich to do battle with the invaders, in case I should fail in my quest.\nYou will, of course, see to it that there will be a corps of your most\nefficient mechanics and artisans within call at all times in case I\nshould return and have sudden need for them.\"\n\n\"All these things shall be done.\"\n\nThe conference ended, the four nobles were quickly landed upon Osnome\nand once more the _Skylark_ traveled out into her element, the total\nvacuum and absolute zero of the outer void, with Crane at the controls.\n\n\"You certainly sounded savage, Dick. I almost thought you really meant\nit!\" Dorothy chuckled.\n\n\"I did mean it, Dot. Those fellows are mighty keen on detecting bluffs.\nIf I hadn't meant it, and if they hadn't known that I meant it, I'd\nnever have got away with it.\"\n\n\"But you _couldn't_ have meant it, Dick! You wouldn't have destroyed the\nOsnomians, surely--you know you wouldn't.\"\n\n\"No, but I would have destroyed what was left of the Urvanians, and all\nfive of us knew exactly how it would have turned out and exactly what I\nwould have done about it--that's why they all pulled in their horns.\"\n\n\"I don't know what would have happened,\" interjected Margaret. \"What\nwould have?\"\n\n\"With this new stuff the Urvanians would have wiped the Osnomians out.\nThey are an older race, and so much better in science and mechanics that\nthe Osnomians wouldn't have stood much chance, and knew it.\nIncidentally, that's why I'm having them build our new ship. They'll put\na lot of stuff into it that Dunark's men would miss--maybe some stuff\nthat even the Fenachrone haven't got. However, though it might seem that\nthe Urvanians had all the best of it, Urvan knew that I had something up\nmy sleeve besides my bare arm--and he knew that I'd clean up what there\nwas left of his race if they polished off the Osnomians.\"\n\n\"What a frightful chance you were taking, Dick!\" gasped Dorothy.\n\n\"You have to be hard to handle those folks--and believe me, I was a\nforty-minute egg right then. They have such a peculiar mental and moral\nslant that we can hardly understand them at all. This idea of\nco-operation is so new to them that it actually dazed all four of them\neven to consider it.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose they will fight, anyway?\" asked Crane.\n\n\"Absolutely not. Both nations have an inflexible code of honor, such as\nit is, and lying is against both codes. That's one thing I like about\nthem--I'm sort of honest myself, and with either of these races you need\nnothing signed or guaranteed.\"\n\n\"What next, Dick?\"\n\n\"Now the real trouble begins. Mart, oil up the massive old intellect.\nHave you found the answer to the problem?\"\n\n\"What problem?\" asked Dorothy. \"You didn't tell us anything about a\nproblem.\"\n\n\"No, I told Mart. I want the best physicist in this entire solar\nsystem--and since there are only one hundred and twenty-five planets\naround these seventeen suns, it should be simple to yon phenomenal\nbrain. In fact, I expect to hear him say 'elementary, my dear Watson,\nelementary'!\"\n\n\"Hardly that, Dick, but I have found out a few things. There are some\neighty planets which are probably habitable for beings like us. Other\nthings being equal, it seems reasonable to assume that the older the\nsun, the longer its planets have been habitable, and therefore the older\nand more intelligent the life....\"\n\n\"'Ha! ha! It was elementary,' says Sherlock.\" Seaton interrupted.\n\"You're heading directly at that largest, oldest, and most intelligent\nplanet, then, I take it, where I can catch me my physicist?\"\n\n\"Not directly at it, no. I am heading for the place where it will be\nwhen we reach it. That is elementary.\"\n\n\"Ouch! That got to me, Mart, right where I live. I'll be good.\"\n\n\"But you are getting ahead of me, Dick--it is not as simple as you have\nassumed from what I have said so far. The Osnomian astronomers have done\nwonders in the short time they have had, but their data, particularly on\nthe planets of the outer suns, is as yet necessarily very incomplete.\nSince the furthermost outer sun is probably the oldest, it is the one in\nwhich we are most interested. It has seven planets, four of which are\nprobably habitable, as far as temperature and atmosphere are concerned.\nHowever, nothing exact is yet known of their masses, motions, or places.\nTherefore I have laid our course to intercept the closest one to us, as\nnearly as I can from what meager data we have. If it should prove to be\ninhabited by intelligent beings, they can probably give us more exact\ninformation concerning their neighboring planets. That is the best I can\ndo.\"\n\n\"That's a darn fine best, old top--narrowing down to four from a hundred\nand twenty-five. Well, until we get there, what to do? Let's sing us a\nsong, to keep our fearless quartette in good voice.\"\n\n\"Before you do anything,\" said Margaret seriously, \"I would like to know\nif you really think there is a chance of defeating those monsters.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"In all seriousness, I do. In fact, I am quite confident of it. If we\nhad two years, I know that we could lick them cold; and by stepping on\nthe gas I believe we can get the dope in less than the six months we\nhave to work in.\"\n\n\"I know that you are serious, Dick. Now you know that I do not want to\ndiscourage any one, but I can see small basis for optimism,\" Crane spoke\nslowly and thoughtfully. \"I hope that you will be able to control the\nzone of force--but you are not studying it yourself. You seem to be\ncertain that somewhere in this system there is a race who already knows\nall about it. I would like to know your reasons for thinking that such a\nrace exists.\"\n\n\"They may not be upon this system; they may have been outsiders, as we\nare--but I have reasons for believing them to be natives of this system,\nsince they were green. You are as familiar with Osnomian mythology as I\nam--you girls in particular have read Osnomian legends to Osnomian\nchildren for hours. Also identically the same legends prevail upon\nUrvania. I read them in that lieutenant's brain--in fact, I looked for\nthem. You also know that every folk-legend has some basis, however\ntenuous, in fact. Now, Dottie, tell about the battle of the gods, when\nOsnome was a pup.\"\n\n\"The gods came down from the sky,\" Dorothy recited. \"They were green, as\nwere men. They wore invisible armor of polished metal, which appeared\nand disappeared. They stayed inside the armor and fought outside it with\nswords and lances of fire. Men who fought against them cut them through\nand through with swords, and they struck the men with lances of flame so\nthat they were stunned. So the gods fought in days long gone and\nvanished in their invisible armor, and----\"\n\n\"That's enough,\" interrupted Seaton. \"The little red-haired girl has her\nlesson perfectly. Get it, Mart?\"\n\n\"No, I cannot say that I do.\"\n\n\"Why, it doesn't even make sense!\" exclaimed Margaret.\n\n\"All right, I'll elucidate. Listen!\" and Seaton's voice grew tense with\nearnestness. \"Visitors came down out of space. They were green. They\nwore zones of force, which they flashed on and off. They stayed inside\nthe zones and projected their images outside, and used rays _through the\nzones_. Men who fought against the images cut them through and through\nwith swords, but could not harm them since they were not actual\nsubstance; and the images directed rays against the men so that they\nwere stunned. So the visitors fought in days long gone, and vanished in\ntheir zones of force. How does that sound?\"\n\n\"You have the most stupendous imagination the world has ever seen--but\nthere may be some slight basis of fact there, after all,\" said Crane,\nslowly.\n\n\"I'm convinced of it, for one reason in particular. Notice that it says\nspecifically that the visitors stunned the natives. Now that thought is\nabsolutely foreign to all Osnomian nature--when they strike they kill,\nand always have. Now if that myth has come down through so many\ngenerations without having that 'stunned' changed to 'killed', I'm\nwilling to bet a few weeks of time that the rest of it came down fairly\nstraight, too. Of course, what they had may not have been the zone of\nforce as we know it, but it must have been a ray of some kind--and\nbelieve me, that was one educated ray. Somebody sure had something, even\n'way back in those days. And if they had anything at all back there,\nthey must know a lot by now. That's why I want to look 'em up.\"\n\n\"But suppose they want to kill us off at sight?\" objected Dorothy. \"They\nmight be able to do it, mightn't they?\"\n\n\"Sure, but they probably wouldn't want to--any more than you would step\non an ant who asked you to help him move a twig. That's about how much\nahead of us they probably are. Of course, we struck a pure mentality\nonce, who came darn near dematerializing us entirely, but I'm betting\nthat these folks haven't got that far along yet. By the way, I've got a\nhunch about those pure intellectuals.\"\n\n\"Oh, tell us about it!\" laughed Margaret. \"Your hunches are the world's\ngreatest brainstorms!\"\n\n\"Well, I pumped out and rejeweled the compass we put on that funny\nplanet--as a last resort, I thought we might maybe visit them and ask\nthat bozo we had the argument with to help us out. I think he--or\nit--would show us everything about the zone of force we want to know. I\ndon't think that we'd be dematerialized, either, because the situation\nwould give him something more to think about for another thousand\ncycles; and thinking seemed to be his main object in life. However, to\nget back to the subject, I found that even with the new power of the\ncompass the entire planet was still out of reach. Unless they've\ndematerialized it, that means about ten billion light-years as an\nabsolute minimum. Think about that for a minute!... I've just got a kind\nof a hunch that maybe they don't belong in this Galaxy at all--that they\nmight be from some other Galaxy, planet and all; just riding around on\nit, as we are riding in the _Skylark_. Is the idea conceivable to a sane\nmind, or not?\"\n\n\"Not!\" decided Dorothy, promptly. \"We'd better go to bed. One more such\nidea, in progression with the last two you've had, would certainly give\nyou a compound fracture of the skull. 'Night, Cranes.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nDuQuesne's Voyage\n\n\nFar from our solar system a cigar-shaped space-car slackened its\nterrific acceleration to a point at which human beings could walk, and\ntwo men got up, exercised vigorously to restore the circulation to their\nnumbed bodies, and went into the galley to prepare their meal--the first\nsince leaving the Earth some eight hours or more before.\n\nBecause of the long and arduous journey he had decided upon, DuQuesne\nhad had to abandon his custom of working alone, and had studied all the\navailable men with great care before selecting his companion and relief\npilot. He finally had chosen \"Baby Doll\" Loring--so called because of\nhis curly yellow hair, his pink and white complexion, his guileless blue\neyes, his slight form of rather less than medium height. But never did\noutward attributes more belie the inner man! The yellow curls covered a\nbrain agile, keen, and hard; the girlish complexion neither paled nor\nreddened under stress; the wide blue eyes had glanced along the barrels\nof so many lethal weapons, that in various localities the noose yawned\nfor him; the slender body was built of rawhide and whalebone, and\nresponded instantly to the dictates of that ruthless brain. Under the\nprotection of Steel he flourished, and in return for that protection he\nperformed, quietly and with neatness and despatch, such odd jobs as were\nin his line, with which he was commissioned.\n\nWhen they were seated at an excellent breakfast of ham and eggs,\nbuttered toast, and strong, aromatic coffee, DuQuesne broke the long\nsilence.\n\n\"Do you want to know where we are?\"\n\n\"I'd say we were a long way from home, by the way this elevator of yours\nhas been climbing all night.\"\n\n\"We are a good many million miles from the Earth, and we are getting\nfarther away at a rate that would have to be measured in millions of\nmiles per second.\" DuQuesne, watching the other narrowly as he made\nthis startling announcement and remembering the effect of a similar one\nupon Perkins, saw with approval that the coffee-cup in midair did not\npause or waver in its course. Loring noted the bouquet of his beverage\nand took an appreciative sip before he replied.\n\n\"You certainly can make coffee, Doctor; and good coffee is nine-tenths\nof a good breakfast. As to where we are--that's all right with me. I can\nstand it if you can.\"\n\n\"Don't you want to know where we're going, and why?\"\n\n\"I've been thinking about that. Before we started I didn't want to know\nanything, because what a man doesn't know he can't be accused of\nspilling in case of a leak. Now that we are on our way, though, maybe I\nshould know enough about things to act intelligently, if something\nunforeseen should develop. If you'd rather keep it dark and give me\norders when necessary, that's all right with me, too. It's your party,\nyou know.\"\n\n\"I brought you along because one man can't stay on duty twenty-four\nhours a day, continuously. Since you are in as deep as you can get, and\nsince this trip is dangerous, you should know everything there is to\nknow. You are one of the higher-ups now, anyway: and we understand each\nother thoroughly, I believe?\"\n\n\"I believe so.\"\n\nBack in the bow control-room DuQuesne applied more power, but not enough\nto render movement impossible.\n\n\"You don't have to drive her as hard all the way, then, as you did last\nnight?\"\n\n\"No, I'm out of range of Seaton's instrument now, and we don't have to\nkill ourselves. High acceleration is punishment for anyone and we must\nkeep ourselves fit. To begin with, I suppose that you are curious about\nthat object-compass?\"\n\n\"That and other things.\"\n\n\"An object-compass is a needle of specially-treated copper, so activated\nthat it points always toward one certain object, after being once set\nupon it. Seaton undoubtedly has one upon me; but, sensitive as they are,\nthey can't hold on a mass as small as a man at this distance. That was\nwhy we left at midnight, after he had gone to bed--so that we'd be out\nof range before he woke up. I wanted to lose him, as he might interfere\nif he knew where I was going. Now I'll go back to the beginning and tell\nyou the whole story.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTersely, but vividly, he recounted the tale of the interstellar cruise,\nthe voyage of the _Skylark of Space_. When he had finished, Loring\nsmoked for a few minutes in silence.\n\n\"There's a lot of stuff there that's hard to understand all at once. Do\nyou mind if I ask a few foolish questions, to get things straightened\nout in my mind?\"\n\n\"Go ahead--ask as many as you want to. It is hard to understand a lot of\nthat Osnomian stuff--a man can't get it all at once.\"\n\n\"Osnome is so far away--how are you going to find it?\"\n\n\"With one of the object-compasses I mentioned. I had planned on\nnavigating from notes I took on the trip back to the Earth, but it\nwasn't necessary. They tried to keep me from finding out anything, but I\nlearned all about the compasses, built a few of them in their own shop,\nand set one on Osnome. I had it, among other things, in my pocket when I\nlanded. In fact, the control of that explosive copper bullet is the only\nthing they had that I wasn't able to get--and I'll get that on this\ntrip.\"\n\n\"What is that arenak armor they're wearing?\"\n\n\"Arenak is a synthetic metal, almost perfectly transparent. It has\npractically the same refractive index as air, therefore it is, to all\nintents and purposes, invisible. It's about five hundred times as strong\nas chrome-vanadium steel, and even when you've got it to the\nyield-point, it doesn't break, but stretches out and snaps back, like\nrubber, with the strength unimpaired. It's the most wonderful thing I\nsaw on the whole trip. They make complete suits of it. Of course they\naren't very comfortable, but since they are only a tenth of an inch they\ncan be worn.\"\n\n\"And a tenth of an inch of that stuff will stop a steel-nosed\nmachine-gun bullet?\"\n\n\"Stop it! A tenth of an inch of arenak is harder to pierce than fifty\ninches of our hardest, toughest armor steel. A sixteenth-inch\narmor-piercing projectile couldn't get through it. It's hard to believe,\nbut nevertheless it's a fact. The only way to kill Seaton with a gun\nwould be to use one heavy enough so that the shock of the impact would\nkill him--and it wouldn't surprise me a bit if he had his armor anchored\nwith an attractor against that very contingency. Even if he hasn't, you\ncan imagine the chance of getting action against him with a gun of that\nsize.\"\n\n\"Yes, I've heard that he is fast.\"\n\n\"That doesn't tell half of it. You know that I'm handy with a gun\nmyself?\"\n\n\"You're faster than I am, and that's saying something. You're chain\nlightning.\"\n\n\"Well, Seaton is at least that much faster than I am. You've never seen\nhim work--I have. On that Osnomian dock he shot twice before I started,\nand shot twice to my once from then on. I must have been shooting a\nquarter of a second after he had his side all cleaned up. To make it\nworse I missed once with my left hand--he didn't. There's absolutely no\nuse tackling Richard Seaton without an Osnomian ray-generator or\nsomething better; but, as you know, Brookings always has been and always\nwill be a fool. He won't believe anything new until after he has\nactually been shown. Well, I imagine he will be shown plenty by this\nevening.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll never tackle him with heat. How does he get that way?\"\n\n\"He's naturally fast, and has practiced sleight-of-hand work ever since\nhe was a kid. He's one of the best amateur magicians in the country, and\nI will say that his ability along that line has come in handy for him\nmore than once.\"\n\n\"I see where you're right in wanting to get something, since we have\nonly ordinary weapons and they have all that stuff. This trip is to get\na little something for ourselves, I take it?\"\n\n\"Exactly, and you know enough now to understand what we are out here to\nget for ourselves. You have guessed that we are headed for Osnome?\"\n\n\"I suspected it. However, if you were going only to Osnome, you would\nhave gone alone; so I also suspect that that's only half of it. I have\nno idea what it is, but you've got something else on your mind.\"\n\n\"You're right--I knew you were keen. When I was on Osnome I found out\nsomething that only four other men--all--dead--ever knew. There is a\nrace of men far ahead of the Osnomians in science, particularly in\nwarfare. They live a long way beyond Osnome. It is my plan to steal an\nOsnomian airship and mount all its ray screens, generators, guns, and\neverything else, upon this ship, or else convert their vessel into a\nspace-ship. Instead of using their ordinary power, however, we will do\nas Seaton did, and use intra-atomic power, which is practically\ninfinite. Then we'll have everything Seaton's got, but that isn't\nenough. I want enough more than he's got to wipe him out. Therefore,\nafter we get a ship armed to suit us, we'll visit this strange planet\nand either come to terms with them or else steal a ship from them. Then\nwe'll have their stuff and that of the Osnomians, as well as our own.\nSeaton won't last long after that.\"\n\n\"Do you mind if I ask how you got that dope?\"\n\n\"Not at all. Except when right with Seaton I could do pretty much as I\npleased, and I used to take long walks for exercise. The Osnomians tired\nvery easily, being so weak, and because of the light gravity of the\nplanet, I had to do a lot of work or walking to keep in any kind of\ncondition at all. I learned Kondalian quickly, and got so friendly with\nthe guards, that pretty soon they quit trying to keep me in sight, but\nwaited at the edge of the palace grounds until I came back and joined\nthem.\n\n\"Well, on one trip I was fifteen miles or so from the city when an\nairship crashed down in a woods about half a mile from me. It was in an\nuninhabited district and nobody else saw it. I went over to investigate,\nthinking probably I could find out something useful. It had the whole\nfront end cut or broken off, and that made me curious, because no\nimaginable fall will break an arenak hull. I walked in through the hole\nand saw that it was one of their fighting tenders--a combination warship\nand repair shop, with all of the stuff in it that I've been telling you\nabout. The generators were mostly burned out and the propelling and\nlifting motors were out of commission. I prowled around, getting\nacquainted with it, and found a lot of useful instruments and, best of\nall, one of Dunark's new mechanical educators, with complete\ninstructions for its use. Also, I found three bodies, and thought I'd\ntry it out....\"\n\n\"Just a minute. Only three bodies on a warship? And what good could a\nmechanical educator do you if the men were all dead?\"\n\n\"Three is all I found then, but there was another one. Three men and a\ncaptain compose an Osnomian crew for any ordinary vessel. Everything is\nautomatic, you, know. As for the men being dead, that doesn't make any\ndifference--you can read their brains just the same, if they haven't\nbeen dead too long. However, when I tried to read theirs, I found only\nblanks--their brains had been destroyed so that nobody could read them.\nThat did look funny, so I ransacked the ship from truck to keelson, and\nfinally found another body, wearing an air-helmet, in a sort of closet\noff the control room. I put the educator on it....\"\n\n\"This is getting good. It sounds like a page of the old 'Arabian Nights'\nthat I used to read when I was a boy. You know, it really isn't\nsurprising that Brookings didn't believe a lot of this stuff.\"\n\n\"As I have said, a lot of it is hard to understand, but I'm going to\nshow it to you--all that, and more.\"\n\n\"Oh, I believe it, all right. After riding in this boat and looking out\nof the windows, I'll believe anything. Reading a dead man's brain is\nsteep, though.\"\n\n\"I'll let you do it after we get there. I don't understand exactly how\nit works, myself, but I know how to operate one. Well, I found out that\nthis man's brain was in good shape, and I got a shock when I read it.\nHere's what he had been through. They had been flying very high on their\nway to the front when their ship was seized by an invisible force and\nthrown upward. He must have thought faster than the others, because he\nput on an air-helmet and dived into this locker where he hid under a\npile of gear, fixing things so that he could see out through the\ntransparent arenak of the wall. No sooner was he hidden that the front\nend of the ship went up in a blaze of light, in spite of their ray\nscreens going full blast. They were up so high by that time that when\nthe bow was burned off the other three fainted from lack of air. Then\ntheir generators went out, and pretty soon two peculiar-looking\nstrangers entered. They were wearing vacuum suits and were very short\nand stocky, giving the impression of enormous strength. They brought an\neducator of their own with them and read the brains of the three men.\nThen they dropped the ship a few thousand feet and revived the three\nwith a drink of something out of a flask.\"\n\n\"Must have been different from the kind handled by most booties I know,\nthen. The stuff we've been getting lately would make a man more\nunconscious than ever.\"\n\n\"Some powerful drug, probably, but the Osnomian didn't know anything\nabout it. After the men were revived, the strangers, apparently from\nsheer cruelty and love of torturing their victims, informed them in the\nOsnomian language that they were from another world, on the far edge of\nthe Galaxy. They even told them, knowing that the Osnomians knew nothing\nof astronomy, exactly where they were from. Then they went on to say\nthat they wanted the entire green system for themselves, and that in\nsomething like two years of our time they were going to wipe out all the\npresent inhabitants of the system and take it over, as a base for\nfurther operations. After that they amused themselves by describing\nexactly the kinds of death and destruction they were going to use. They\ndescribed most of it in great detail. It's too involved to tell you\nabout now, but they've got rays, generators, and screens that even the\nOsnomians never heard of. And of course they've got intra-atomic energy\nthe same as we have. After telling them all this and watching them\nsuffer, they put a machine on their heads and they dropped dead. That's\nprobably what disintegrated their brains. Then they looked the ship over\nrather casually, as though they didn't see anything they were interested\nin; crippled the motors; and went away. The vessel was then released,\nand crashed. This man, of course, was killed by the fall. I buried the\nmen--I didn't want anybody else reading that brain--hid some of the\nstuff I wanted most, and camouflaged the ship so that I'm fairly sure\nthat it's there yet. I decided then to make this trip.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Loring's mind was grappling with these new and strange facts.\n\"That news is staggering, Doctor. Think of it. Everybody thinks our own\nworld is everything there is!\"\n\n\"Our world is simply a grain of dust in the Universe. Most people know\nit, academically, but very few ever give the fact any actual\nconsideration. But now that you've had a little time to get used to the\nidea of there being other worlds, and some of them as far ahead of us in\nscience as we are ahead of the monkeys, what do you think of it?\"\n\n\"I agree with you, that we've got their stuff,\" said Loring. \"However,\nit occurs to me as a possibility that they may have so much stuff that\nwe won't be able to make the approach. However, if the Osnomian fittings\nwe're going to get are as good as you say they are, I think that two\nsuch men as you and I can get at least a lunch while any other crew, no\nmatter who they are, are getting a square meal.\"\n\n\"I like your style, Loring. You and I will have the world eating out of\nour hands shortly after we get back. As far as actual procedure over\nthere is concerned, of course, I haven't made any definite plans. We'll\nhave to size up the situation after we get there before we can know\nexactly what we'll have to do. However, we are not coming back\nempty-handed.\"\n\n\"You said something, Chief!\" and the two men, so startlingly unlike\nphysically, but so alike inwardly, shook hands in token of their mutual\ndedication to a single purpose.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLoring was then instructed in the simple navigation of the ship of\nspace, and thereafter the two men took their regular shifts at the\ncontrols. In due time they approached Osnome, and DuQuesne studied the\nplanet carefully through a telescope before he ventured down into the\natmosphere.\n\n\"This half of it used to be Mardonale. I suppose it's all Kondal now.\nNo, there's a war on down there yet--at least, there's a disturbance of\nsome kind, and on this planet that means war.\"\n\n\"What are you looking for, exactly?\" asked Loring, who was also\nexamining the terrain with a telescope.\n\n\"They've got some spherical space-ships, like Seaton's. I know they had\none, and they've probably built more of them since that time. Their\nairships can't touch us, but those ball-shaped cruisers would be pure\npoison for us, the way we are fixed now. Can you see any of them?\"\n\n\"Not yet. Too far away to make out details. They're certainly having a\nhot time down there, though, in that one spot.\"\n\nThey dropped lower, toward the stronghold which was being so stubbornly\ndefended by the inhabitants of the third planet of the fourteenth sun,\nand so savagely attacked by the Kondalian forces.\n\n\"There, we can see what they're doing now,\" and DuQuesne anchored the\nvessel with an attractor. \"I want to see if they've got many of those\nspace-ships in action, and you will want to see what war is like, when\nit is fought by people, who have been making war steadily for ten\nthousand years.\"\n\nPoised at the limit of clear visibility, the two men studied the\nincessant battle being waged beneath them. They saw not one, but fully a\nthousand of the globular craft high in the air and grouped in a great\ncircle around an immense fortification upon the ground below. They saw\nno airships in the line of battle, but noticed that many such vessels\nwere flying to and from the front, apparently carrying supplies. The\nfortress was an immense dome of some glassy, transparent material,\npartially covered with slag, through which they saw that the central\nspace was occupied by orderly groups of barracks, and that round the\ncircumference were arranged gigantic generators, projectors, and other\nmachinery at whose purposes they could not even guess. From the base of\nthe dome a twenty-mile-wide apron of the same glassy substance spread\nover the ground, and above this apron and around the dome were thrown\nthe mighty defensive ray-screens, visible now and then in scintillating\nviolet splendor as one of the copper-driven Kondalian projectors sought\nin vain for an opening. But the Earth-men saw with surprise that the\nmain attack was not being directed at the dome; that only an occasional\nray was thrown against it in order to make the defenders keep their\nscreens up continuously. The edge of the apron was bearing the brunt of\nthat vicious and never-ceasing attack, and most concerned the desperate\ndefense.\n\nFor miles beyond that edge, and as deep under it as frightful rays and\nenormous charges of explosive copper could penetrate, the ground was one\nseething, flaming volcano of molten and incandescent lava; lava\nconstantly being volatilized by the unimaginable heat of those rays and\nbeing hurled for miles in all directions by the inconceivable power of\nthose explosive copper projectiles--the heaviest projectiles that could\nbe used without endangering the planet itself--being directed under the\nexposed edge of that unbreakable apron, which was in actuality anchored\nto the solid core of the planet itself; lava flowing into and filling up\nthe vast craters caused by the explosions. The attack seemed fiercest at\ncertain points, perhaps a quarter of a mile apart around the circle, and\nafter a time the watchers perceived that at those points, under the edge\nof the apron, in that indescribable inferno of boiling lava, destructive\nrays, and disintegrating copper, there were enemy machines at work.\nThese machines were strengthening the protecting apron and extending it,\nvery slowly, but ever wider and ever deeper as the ground under it and\nbefore it was volatilized or hurled away by the awful forces of the\nKondalian attack. So much destruction had already been wrought that the\nedge of the apron and its molten moat were already fully a mile below\nthe normal level of that cratered, torn, and tortured plain.\n\nNow and then one of the mechanical moles would cease its labors,\novercome by the concentrated fury of destruction centered upon it. Its\nshattered remnants would be withdrawn and shortly, repaired or replaced,\nit would be back at work. But it was not the defenders who had suffered\nmost heavily. The fortress was literally ringed about with the shattered\nremnants of airships, and the riddled hulls of more than a few of those\nmighty globular cruisers of the void bore mute testimony to the\ndeadliness and efficiency of the warfare of the invaders.\n\nEven as they watched, one of the spheres, unable for some reason to\nmaintain its screens or overcome by the awful forces playing upon it,\nflared from white into and through the violet and was hurled upward as\nthough shot from the mouth of some Brobdingnagian howitzer. A door\nopened, and from its flaming interior four figures leaped out into the\nair, followed by a puff of orange-colored smoke. At the first sign of\ntrouble, the ship next it in line leaped in front of it and the four\nfigures floated gently to the ground, supported by friendly attractors\nand protected from enemy rays by the bulk and by the screens of the\nrescuing vessel. Two great airships soared upward from back of the lines\nand hauled the disabled vessel to the ground by means of their powerful\nattractors. The two observers saw with amazement that after brief\nattention from an ant-like ground-crew, the original four men climbed\nback into their warship and she again shot into the fray, apparently as\ngood as ever.\n\n\"What do you know about that!\" exclaimed DuQuesne. \"That gives me an\nidea, Loring. They must get to them that way fairly often, to judge by\nthe teamwork they use when it does happen. How about waiting until they\ndisable another one like that, and then grabbing it while its in the\nair, deserted and unable to fight back? One of those ships is worth a\nthousand of this one, even if we had everything known to the Osnomians.\"\n\n\"That's a real idea--those boats certainly are brutes for punishment,\"\nagreed Loring, and as both men again settled down to watch the battle,\nhe went on: \"So this is war out this way? You're right. Seaton, with\nhalf this stuff, could whip the combined armies and navies of the world.\nI don't blame Brookings much, though, at that--nobody could believe half\nof this unless they could actually see it, as we are doing.\"\n\n\"I can't understand it,\" DuQuesne frowned as he considered the\nsituation. \"The attackers are Kondalians, all right--those ships are\ndevelopments of the _Skylark_--but I don't get that fort at all. Wonder\nif it can be the strangers already? Don't think so--they aren't due for\na couple of years yet, and I don't think the Kondalians could stand\nagainst them a minute. It must be what is left of Mardonale, although I\nnever heard of anything like that. Probably it is some new invention\nthey dug up at the last minute. That's it, I guess,\" and his brow\ncleared. \"It couldn't be anything else.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey waited long for the incident to be repeated, and finally their\npatience was rewarded. When the next vessel was disabled and hurled\nupward by the concentration of enemy forces, DuQuesne darted down,\nseized it with his most powerful attractor, and whisked it away into\nspace at such a velocity that to the eyes of the Kordalians it simply\ndisappeared. He took the disabled warship far out into space and allowed\nit to cool off for a long time before deciding that it was safe to board\nit. Through the transparent walls they could see no sign of life, and\nDuQuesne donned a vacuum suit and stepped into the airlock. As Loring\nheld the steel vessel close to the stranger, DuQuesne leaped lightly\nthrough the open door into the interior. Shutting the door, he opened an\nauxiliary air-tank, adjusting the gauge to one atmosphere as he did so.\nThe pressure normal, he divested himself of the suit and made a thorough\nexamination of the vessel. He then signaled Loring to follow him, and\nsoon both ships were over Kondal, so high as to be invisible from the\nground. Plunging the vessel like a bullet towards the grove in which he\nhad left the Kondalian airship, he slowed abruptly just in time to make\na safe landing. As he stepped out upon Osnomian soil, Loring landed the\nEarthly ship hardly less skillfully.\n\n\"This saves us a lot of trouble, Loring. This is undoubtedly one of the\nfinest space-ships of the Universe, and just about ready for anything.\"\n\n\"How did they get to it?\"\n\n\"One of the screen generators apparently weakened a trifle, probably\nfrom weeks of continuous use. That let some of the rays come through;\neverything got hot, and the crew had to jump or roast. Nothing is hurt,\nthough, as the ship was thrown up and out of range before the arenak\nmelted at all. The copper repellers are gone, of course, and most of the\nbars that were in use are melted down, but there was enough of the main\nbar left to drive the ship and we can replace the melted stuff easily\nenough. Nothing else was hurt, as there's absolutely nothing in the\nstructure of these vessels that can be burned. Even the insulation in\nthe coils and generators has a melting-point higher than that of\nporcelain. And not all the copper was melted, either. Some of these\nstorerooms are lined with two feet of insulation and are piled full of\nbars and explosive ammunition.\"\n\n\"What was the smoke we saw, then?\"\n\n\"That was their food-supply. It's cooked to an ash, and their water was\nall boiled away through the safety-valves. Those rays certainly can put\nout a lot of heat in a second or two!\"\n\n\"Can the two of us put on those copper repeller-bands? This ship must be\nseventy-five feet in diameter.\"\n\n\"Yes, it's a lot bigger than the _Skylark_ was. It's one of their latest\nmodels, or it wouldn't have been on the front line. As to banding on the\nrepellers--that's easy. That airship is half full of metal-working\nmachinery that can do everything but talk. I know how to use most of it,\nfrom seeing it in use, and we can figure out the rest.\"\n\nIn that unfrequented spot there was little danger of detection from the\nair. And none whatsoever of detection from the ground--of ground-travel\nupon Osnome there is none. Nevertheless, the two men camouflaged the\nvessels so that they were visible only to keen and direct scrutiny, and\ndrove their task through to completion on the shortest possible time.\nThe copper repellers were banded on, and much additional machinery was\ninstalled in the already well-equipped shop. This done, they transferred\nto their warship food, water, bedding, instruments, and everything else\nthey needed or wanted from their own ship and from the disabled\nKondalian airship. They made a last tour of inspection to be sure they\nhad overlooked nothing useful, then embarked.\n\n\"Think anybody will find those ships? They could get a good line on what\nwe've done.\"\n\n\"Probably, eventually, Loring, so we'd better destroy them. We'd better\ntake a short hop first, though, to test everything out. Since you're not\nfamiliar with the controls of a ship of this type, you need practise.\nShoot us up around that moon over there and bring us back to this spot.\"\n\n\"She's a sweet-handling boat--easy like a bicycle,\" declared Loring as\nhe brought the vessel lightly to a landing upon their return. \"We can\nburn the old one up now. We'll never need her again, any more than a\nsnake needs his last year's skin.\"\n\n\"She's good, all right. Those two hulks must be put out of existence,\nbut we shouldn't do it here. The rays would set the woods afire, and the\nmetal would condense all around. We don't want to leave any tracks, so\nwe'd better pull them out into space to destroy them. We could turn them\nloose, and as you've never worked a ray, it'll be good practice for you.\nAlso, I want you to see for yourself just what our best armour-plate\namounts to compared with arenak.\"\n\nWhen they towed the two vessels far out into space, Loring put into\npractise the instruction he had received from DuQuesne concerning the\ncomplex armament of their vessel. He swung the beam-projector upon the\nKondalian airship, pressed the connectors of the softener ray, the heat\nray, and the induction ray, and threw the master switch. Almost\ninstantly the entire hull became blinding white, but it was several\nseconds before the extremely refractory material began to volatilize.\nThough the metal was less than an inch think, it retained its shape and\nstrength stubbornly, and only slowly did it disappear in flaming,\nflaring gusts of incandescent gas.\n\n\"There, you've seen what an inch of arenak is like,\" said DuQuesne when\nthe destruction was complete. \"Now shine it on that sixty-inch\nchrome-vanadium armor hull of our old bus and see what happens.\"\n\nLoring did so. As the beam touched it, the steel disappeared in one\nflare of radiance--as he swung the projector in one flashing arc from\nthe stem to the stern there was nothing left. Loring, swinging the beam,\nwhistled in amazement.\n\n\"Wow! What a difference! And this ship of ours has a skin of arenak six\nfeet thick!\"\n\n\"Yes. Now you understand why I didn't want to argue with anybody out\nhere as long as we were in our steel ship.\"\n\n\"I understand, all right; but I can't understand the power of these\nrays. Suppose I had had all twenty of them on instead of only three?\"\n\n\"In that case, I think that we could have whipped even the short, thick\nstrangers.\"\n\n\"You and me both. But say, every ship's got to have a name. This new one\nof ours is such a sweet, harmless, inoffensive little thing, we'd better\nname her the _Violet_, hadn't we?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDuQuesne started the _Violet_ off in the direction of the solar system\noccupied by the warlike strangers, but he did not hurry. He and Loring\npracticed incessantly for days at the controls, darting here and there,\nputting on terrific acceleration until the indicators showed a velocity\nof hundreds of thousand of miles per second, then reversing the\nacceleration until the velocity was zero. They studied the controls and\nalarm system until each knew perfectly every instrument, every tiny\nlight, and the tone of each bell. They practiced with the rays, singly\nand in combination, with the visiplates, and with the many levers and\ndials, until each was so familiar with the complex installation that his\nhandling of every control had become automatic. Not until then did\nDuQuesne give the word to start out in earnest toward their goal, at an\nunthinkable distance.\n\nThey had not been under way long when an alarm bell sounded its warning\nand a brilliant green light began flashing upon the board.\n\n\"Hm ... m,\" DuQuesne frowned as he reversed the bar. \"Outside\nintra-atomic energy detector. Somebody's using power out here.\nDirection, about dead ahead--straight down. Let's see if we can see\nanything.\"\n\nHe swung number six, the telescopic visiplate, into connection. After\nwhat seemed to them a long time they saw a sudden sharp flash,\napparently an immense distance ahead, and simultaneously three more\nalarm bells rang and three colored lights flashed briefly.\n\n\"Somebody got quite a jolt then. Three rays in action at once for three\nor four seconds,\" reported DuQuesne, as he applied still more negative\nacceleration.\n\n\"I'd like to know what this is all about!\" he exclaimed after a time, as\nthey saw a subdued glow, which lasted a minute or two. As the warning\nlight was flashing more and more slowly and with diminishing intensity,\nthe _Violet_ was once more put upon her course. As she proceeded,\nhowever, the warnings of the liberation of intra-atomic energy grew\nstronger and stronger, and both men scanned their path intensely for a\nsight of the source of the disturbance, while their velocity was cut to\nonly a few hundred miles an hour. Suddenly the indicator swerved and\npointed behind them, showing that they had passed the object, whatever\nit was. DuQuesne instantly applied power and snapped on a small\nsearchlight.\n\n\"If it's so small that we couldn't see it when we passed it, it's\nnothing to be afraid of. We'll be able to find it with a light.\"\n\nAfter some search, they saw an object floating in space-apparently a\nvacuum suit!\n\n\"Shall one of us get in the airlock, or shall we bring it in with an\nattractor?\" asked Loring.\n\n\"An attractor, by all means. Two or three of them, in fact, to\nspread-eagle whatever it is. Never take any chances. It's probably an\nOsnomian, but you never can tell. It may be one of those other people.\nWe know they were around here a few weeks ago, and they're the only ones\nI know of that have intra-atomic power besides us and the Osnomians.\"\n\n\"That's no Osnomian,\" he continued, as the stranger was drawn into the\nairlock. \"He's big enough around for four Osnomians, and very short.\nWe'll take no chances at all with that fellow.\"\n\nThe captive was brought into the control room pinioned head, hand, and\nfoot with attractors and repellers, before DuQuesne approached him. He\nthen read the temperature and pressure of the stranger's air-supply, and\nallowed the surplus air to escape slowly before removing the stranger's\nsuit and revealing one of the Fenachrone--eyes closed, unconscious or\ndead.\n\nDuQuesne leaped for the educator and handed Loring a headset.\n\n\"Put this on quick. He may be only unconscious, and we might not be able\nto get a thing from him if he were awake.\"\n\nLoring donned the headset, still staring at the monstrous form with\namazement, not unmixed with awe, while DuQuesne, paying no attention to\nanything except the knowledge he was seeking, manipulated the controls\nof the instrument. His first quest was for the weapons and armament of\nthe vessel. In this he was disappointed, as he learned that the stranger\nwas one of the navigating engineers, and as such, had no detailed\nknowledge of the matters of prime importance to the inquisitor. He did\nhave a complete knowledge of the marvelous Fenachrone propulsion system,\nhowever, and this DuQuesne carefully transferred to his own brain. He\nthen rapidly explored other regions of that fearsome organ of thought.\n\nAs the gigantic and inhuman brain was spread before them, DuQuesne and\nLoring read not only the language, customs, and culture of the\nFenachrone, but all their plans for the future, as well as the events of\nthe past. Plainly in his mind they perceived how he had been cast adrift\nin the emptiness of the void. They saw the Fenachrone cruiser lying in\nwait for the two globular vessels. Looking through an extraordinarily\npowerful telescope with the eyes of their prisoner, they saw them\napproach, all unsuspecting. DuQuesne recognized all five persons in the\n_Skylark_ and Dunark and Sitar in the Kondal; such was that unearthly\noptical instrument and so clear was the impression upon the mind before\nhim. They saw the attack and the battle. They saw the _Skylark_ throw\noff her zone of force and attack; saw this one survivor standing\ndirectly in line with a huge projector-spring, and saw the spring\nsevered by the zone. The free end, under its thousands of pounds of\ntension, had struck the being upon the side of the head, and the force\nof the blow, only partially blocked by the heavy helmet, had hurled him\nout through the yawning gap in the wall and hundreds of miles out into\nspace.\n\nSuddenly the clear view of the brain of the Fenachrone became blurred\nand meaningless and the flow of knowledge ceased--the prisoner had\nregained consciousness and was trying with all his gigantic strength to\nbreak from those intangible bonds that held him. So powerful were the\nforces upon him, however, that only a few twitching muscles gave\nevidence that he was struggling at all. Glancing about him he recognized\nthe attractors and repellers bearing upon him, ceased his efforts to\nescape, and hurled the full power of his baleful gaze into the black\neyes so close to his own. But DuQuesne's mind, always under perfect\ncontrol and now amply reenforced by a considerable proportion of the\nstranger's own knowledge and power, did not waver under the force of\neven that hypnotic glare.\n\n\"It is useless, as you observe,\" he said coldly, in the stranger's own\ntongue, and sneered. \"You are perfectly helpless. Unlike you of the\nFenachrone, however, men of my race do not always kill strangers at\nsight, merely because they are strangers. I will spare your life, if you\ncan give me anything of enough value to me to make extra time and\ntrouble worth while.\"\n\n\"You read my mind while I could not resist your childish efforts. I will\nhave no traffic whatever with you who have destroyed my vessel. If you\nhave mentality enough to understand any portion of my mind--which I\ndoubt--you already know the fate in store for you. Do with me what you\nwill.\" This from the stranger.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDuQuesne pondered long before he replied; considering whether it was to\nhis advantage to inform this stranger of the facts. Finally he decided.\n\n\"Sir, neither I nor this vessel had anything to do with the destruction\nof your warship. Our detectors discovered you floating in empty space;\nwe stopped and rescued you from death. We have seen nothing else, save\nwhat we saw pictured in your own brain. I know that, in common with all\nof your race, you possess neither conscience nor honor, as we understand\nthe terms. An automatic liar by instinct and training whenever you think\nlies will best serve your purpose, you may yet have intelligence enough\nto recognize simple truth when you hear it. You already have observed\nthat we are of the same race as those who destroyed your vessel, and\nhave assumed that we are with them. In that you are wrong. It is true\nthat I am acquainted with those others, but they are my enemies. I am\nhere to kill them, not to aid them. You have already helped me in one\nway--I know as much as does my enemy concerning the impenetrable shield\nof force. If I will return you unharmed to your own planet, will you\nassist me in stealing one of your ships of space, so that I may destroy\nthat Earth-vessel?\"\n\nThe Fenachrone, paying no attention to DuQuesne's barbed comments\nconcerning his honor and veracity, did not hesitate an instant in his\nreply.\n\n\"I will not. We supermen of the Fenachrone will allow no vessel of ours,\nwith its secrets unknown to any others of the Universe, to fall into the\nhands of any of the lesser breeds of men.\"\n\n\"Well, you didn't try to lie that time, anyway,\" said DuQuesne, \"but\nthink a minute. Seaton, my enemy, already has one of your vessels--don't\nthink he is too much of a fool to put it back together and to learn its\nevery secret. Then, too, remember that I have your mind, and can get\nalong without you; even though I am willing to admit that you could be\nof enough help to me so that I would save your life in exchange for that\nhelp. Also remember that, superman though you may be, your mentality\ncannot cope with the forces I have bearing upon you. Neither will your\nbeing a superman enable your body to retain life after I have pushed you\nthrough yonder door, dressed as you are in a silken tunic.\"\n\n\"I have the normal love of life,\" was the reply, \"but some things cannot\nbe done, even with life at stake. Stealing a vessel of the Fenachrone is\none of those things. I can, however, do this much--if you will return me\nto my own planet, you two shall be received as guests aboard one of our\nvessels and shall be allowed to witness the vengeance of the Fenachrone\nupon your enemy. Then you shall be returned to your vessel and allowed\nto depart unharmed.\"\n\n\"Now you are lying by rote--I know just what you'd do,\" said DuQuesne.\n\"Get that idea out of your head right now. The attractors now holding\nyou will not be released until after you have told all. Then, and then\nonly, will we try to discover a way of returning you to your own world\nsafely, and yet in a manner which will in no way jeopardize my own\nsafety. Incidentally, I warn you that the first sign of an attempt to\nplay false with me in any way will mean your instant death.\"\n\nThe prisoner remained silent, analyzing every feature of the situation,\nand DuQuesne continued, coldly:\n\n\"Here's something else for you to think about. If you are unwilling to\nhelp us, what is to prevent me from killing you, and then hunting up\nSeaton and making peace with him for the duration of this forthcoming\nwar? With the fragments of your vessel, which he has; with my knowledge\nof your mind, reenforced by your own dead brain; and with the vast\nresources of all the planets of the green system; there is no doubt that\nthe plans of the Fenachrone will be seriously interfered with. Myriads\nof your race will certainly lose their lives, and it is quite possible\nthat your entire race would be destroyed. Understand that I care nothing\nfor the green system. You are welcome to it if you do as I ask. If you\ndo not, I shall warn them and help them simply to protect my world,\nwhich is now my own personal property.\"\n\n\"In return for our armament and equipment, you promise not to warn the\ngreen system against us? The death of your enemy takes first place in\nyour mind?\" The stranger spoke thoughtfully. \"In that I understand your\nviewpoint thoroughly. But, after I have remodeled your power-plant into\nours and have piloted you to our planet, what assurance have I that you\nwill liberate me, as you have said?\"\n\n\"None whatever--I have made and am asking no promises, since I cannot\nexpect you to trust me, any more than I can trust you. Enough of this\nargument! I am master here, and I am dictating terms. We can get along\nwithout you. Therefore you must decide quickly whether you would rather\ndie suddenly and surely, here in space and right now, or help us as I\ndemand and live until you get back home--enjoying meanwhile your life\nand whatever chance you think you may have of being liberated within the\natmosphere of your own planet.\"\n\n\"Just a minute, Chief!\" Loring said, in English, his back to the\nprisoner. \"Wouldn't we gain more by killing him and going back to Seaton\nand the green system, as you suggested?\"\n\n\"No.\" DuQuesne also turned away, to shield his features from the\nmind-reading gaze of the Fenachrone. \"That was pure bluff. I don't want\nto get within a million miles of Seaton until after we have the armament\nof this fellow's ships. I couldn't make peace with Seaton now, even if I\nwanted to--and I haven't the slightest intention of trying. I intend\nkilling him on sight. Here's what we're going to do. First, we'll get\nwhat we came after. Then we'll find the _Skylark_ and blow her clear\nout of space, and take over the pieces of that Fenachrone ship. After\nthat we'll head for the green system, and with their own stuff and what\nwe'll give them, they'll be able to give those fiends a hot reception.\nBy the time they finally destroy the Osnomians--if they do--we'll have\nthe world ready for them.\" He turned to the Fenachrone. \"What is your\ndecision?\"\n\n\"I submit, in the hope that you will keep your promise, since there is\nno alternative but death,\" and the awful creature, still loosely held by\nthe attractors and carefully watched by DuQuesne and Loring, fairly tore\ninto the task of rebuilding the Osnomian power-plant into the\nspace-annihilating drive of the Fenachrone--for he well knew one fact\nthat DuQuesne's hurried inspection had failed to glean from the\nlabyrinthine intricacies of that fearsome brain: that once within the\ndetector screens of that distant solar system these Earth-beings would\nbe utterly helpless before the forces which would inevitably be turned\nupon them. Also, he realized that time was precious, and resolved to\ndrive the _Violet_ so unmercifully that she would overtake that fleeing\ntorpedo, now many hours upon its way--the torpedo bearing news, for the\nfirst time in Fenachrone history, of the overwhelming defeat and capture\nof one of its mighty engines of interstellar war.\n\nIn a very short time, considering the complexity of the undertaking, the\nconversion of the power-plant was done and the repellers, already\nsupposed the ultimate in protection, were reenforced by a\nten-thousand-pound mass of activated copper, effective for untold\nmillions of miles. Their monstrous pilot then set the bar and advanced\nboth levers of the dual power control out to the extreme limit of their\ntravel.\n\nThere was no sense of motion or of acceleration, since the new system of\npropulsion acted upon every molecule of matter within the radius of\nactivity of the bar, which had been set to include the entire hull. The\npassengers felt only the utter lack of all weight and the other peculiar\nsensations with which they were already familiar, as each had had\nprevious experience of free motion in space. But in spite of the lack of\napparent motion, the _Violet_ was now leaping through the unfathomable\ndepths of interstellar space with the unthinkable speed of five times\nthe velocity of light!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nThe Porpoise-Men of Dasor\n\n\n\"How long do you figure it's going to take us to get there, Mart?\"\nSeaton asked from a corner, where he was bending over his\napparatus-table.\n\n\"About three days at this acceleration. I set it at what I thought the\nsafe maximum for the girls. Should we increase it?\"\n\n\"Probably not--three days isn't bad. Anyway, to save even one day we'd\nhave to more than double the acceleration, and none of us could do\nanything, so we'd better let it ride. How're you making it, Peg?\"\n\n\"I'm getting used to weighing a ton now. My knees buckled only once this\nmorning from my forgetting to watch them when I tried to walk. Don't let\nme interfere, though! if I am slowing us down, I'll go to bed and stay\nthere!\"\n\n\"It'd hardly pay,\" said Seaton. \"We can use the time to good advantage.\nLook here, Mart--I've been looking over this stuff I got out of their\nship and here's something I know you'll eat up. They refer to it as a\nchart, but it's three-dimensional and almost incredible. I can't say\nthat I understand it, but I get an awful kick out of looking at it. I've\nbeen studying it a couple of hours, and haven't started yet. I haven't\nfound our solar system, the green one, or their own. It's too heavy to\nmove around now, because of the acceleration we're using--come on over\nhere and give it a look.\"\n\nThe \"chart\" was a strip of some parchment-like material, or film,\napparently miles in length, wound upon reels at each end of the machine.\nOne section of the film was always under the viewing mechanism--an\noptical system projecting an undistorted image into a visiplate plate\nsomewhat similar to their own--and at the touch of a lever, a small\natomic motor turned the reels and moved the film through the projector.\n\nIt was not an ordinary star-chart: it was three-dimensional,\nultra-stereoscopic. The eye did not perceive a flat surface, but beheld\nan actual, extremely narrow wedge of space as seen from the center of\nthe galaxy. Each of the closer stars was seen in its true position in\nspace and in its true perspective, and each was clearly identified by\nnumber. In the background were faint stars and nebulous masses of light,\ntoo distant to be resolved into separate stars--a true representation of\nthe actual sky. As both men stared, fascinated, into the visiplate,\nSeaton touched the lever and they apparently traveled directly along the\ncenter line of that ever-widening wedge. As they proceeded, the nearer\nstars grew brighter and larger, soon becoming suns, with their planets\nand then the satellites of the planets plainly visible, and finally\npassing out of the picture behind the observers. The fainter stars\nbecame bright, grew into suns and solar systems, and were passed in\nturn. The chart unrolled, and the nebulous masses of light were\napproached, became composed of faint stars, which developed as had the\nothers, and were passed.\n\nFinally, when the picture filled the entire visiplate, they arrived at\nthe outermost edge of the galaxy. No more stars were visible: they saw\nempty space stretching for inconceivably vast distances before them. But\nbeyond that indescribable and incomprehensible vacuum they saw faint\nlenticular bodies of light, which were also named, and which each man\nknew to be other galaxies, charted and named by the almost unlimited\npower of the Fenachrone astronomers, but not as yet explored. As the\nmagic scroll unrolled still farther, they found themselves back in the\ncenter of the galaxy, starting outward in the wedge adjacent to the one\nwhich they had just traversed. Seaton cut off the motor and wiped his\nforehead.\n\n\"Wouldn't that break you off at the ankles, Mart? Did you ever conceive\nthe possibility of such a thing?\n\n\"It would, and I did not. There are literally miles and miles of film in\neach of those reels, and I see that there is a magazine full of reels in\nthe cabinet. There must be an index or a master-chart.\"\n\n\"Yeah, there's a book in this slot here,\" said Seaton, \"but we don't\nknow any of their names or numbers--wait a minute! How did he report our\nEarth on that torpedo? Planet number three of sun six four something\nPilarone, wasn't it? I'll get the record.\n\n\"Six four seven three Pilarone, it was.\"\n\n\"Pilarone ... let's see....\" Seaton studied the index volume. \"Reel\ntwenty, scene fifty-one, I'd translate it.\"\n\nThey found the reel, and \"scene fifty-one\" did indeed show that section\nof space in which our solar system is. Seaton stopped the chart when\nstar six four seven three was at its closest range, and there was our\nsun; with its nine planets and their many satellites accurately shown\nand correctly described.\n\n\"They know their stuff, all right--you've got to hand it to 'em. I've\nbeen straightening out that brain record--cutting out the hazy stretches\nand getting his knowledge straightened out so we can use it, and there's\na lot of this kind of stuff in the record you can get. Suppose that you\ncan figure out exactly where he comes from with this dope and with his\nbrain record?\"\n\n\"Certainly. I may be able to get more complete information upon the\ngreen system than the Osnomians have, which will be very useful indeed.\nYou are right--I am intensely interested in this material, and if you do\nnot care particularly about studying it any more at this time, I believe\nthat I should begin to study it now.\"\n\n\"Hop to it. I'm going to study that record some more. No human brain can\ntake it all, I'm afraid, especially all at once, but I'm going to kinda\npeck around the edges and get me some dope that I want pretty badly. We\ngot a lot of stuff from that wampus.\"\n\nAbout sixty hours out, Dorothy, who had been observing the planet\nthrough number six visiplate, called Seaton away from the Fenachrone\nbrain-record, upon which he was still concentrating.\n\n\"Come here a minute, Dickie! Haven't you got that knowledge all packed\naway in your skull yet?\"\n\n\"I'll say I haven't. That bird's brain would make a dozen of mine, and\nit was loaded until the scuppers were awash. I'm just nibbling around\nthe edges yet.\"\n\n\"I've always heard that the capacity of even the human brain was almost\ninfinite. Isn't that true?\" asked Margaret.\n\n\"Maybe it is, if the knowledge were built up gradually over generations.\nI think maybe I can get most of this stuff into my peanut brain so I can\nuse it, but it's going to be an awful job.\"\n\n\"Is their brain really as far ahead of ours as I gathered from what I\nsaw of it?\" asked Crane.\n\n\"It sure is,\" replied Seaton, \"as far as knowledge and intelligence are\nconcerned, but they have nothing else in common with us. They don't\nbelong to the genus 'homo' at all, really. Instead of having a common\nancestor with the anthropoids, as they say we had, they evolved from a\ngenus which combined the worst traits of the cat tribe and the\ncarnivorous lizards--the most savage and bloodthirsty branches of the\nanimal kingdom--and instead of getting better as they went along, they\ngot worse, in that respect at least. But they sure do know something.\nWhen you get a month or so to spare, you want to put on this harness and\ngrab his knowledge, being very careful to steer clear of his mental\ntraits and so on. Then, when we get back to the Earth, we'll simply tear\nit apart and rebuild it. You'll know what I mean when you get this stuff\ntransplanted into your own skull. But to cut out the lecture, what's on\nyour mind, Dottie Dimple?\"\n\n\"This planet Martin picked out is all wet, literally. The visibility is\nfine--very few clouds--but this whole half of it is solid ocean. If\nthere are any islands, even, they're mighty small.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll four looked into the receiver. With the great magnification\nemployed, the planet almost filled the visiplate. There were a few\nfleecy wisps of cloud, but the entire surface upon which they gazed was\none sheet of the now familiar deep and glorious blue peculiar to the\nwaters of that cuprous solar system, with no markings whatever.\n\n\"What d'you make of it, Mart? That's water all right--copper-sulphate\nsolution, just like the Osnomian and Urvanian oceans--and nothing else\nvisible. How big would an island have to be for us to see it from here?\"\n\n\"So much depends upon the contour and nature of the island, that it is\nhard to say. If it were low and heavily covered with their green-blue\nvegetation, we might not be able to see even a rather large one, whereas\nif it were hilly and bare, we could probably see one only a few miles in\ndiameter.\"\n\n\"Well, one good thing, anyway, we're approaching it from the central\nsun, and almost in line with their own sun, so it's daylight all over\nit. As it turns and as we get closer, we'll see what we can see. Better\ntake turns watching it, hadn't we?\" asked Seaton.\n\nIt was decided, and while the _Skylark_ was still some distance away,\nseveral small islands became visible, and the period of rotation of the\nplanet was determined to be in the neighborhood of fifty hours.\nMargaret, then at the controls, picked out the largest island visible\nand directed the bar toward it. As they dropped down close to their\nobjective, they found that the air was of the same composition as that\nof Osnome, but had a pressure of seventy-eight centimeters of mercury,\nand that the surface gravity of the planet was ninety-five hundredths\nthat of the Earth.\n\n\"Fine business!\" exulted Seaton. \"Just about like home, but I don't see\nmuch of any place to land without getting wet, do you? Those reflectors\nare probably solar generators, and they cover the whole island except\nfor that lagoon right under us.\"\n\nThe island, perhaps ten miles long and half that in width, was entirely\ncovered with great parabolic reflectors, arranged so closely together\nthat little could be seen between them. Each reflector apparently\nfocussed upon an object in the center, a helix which seemed to writhe\nluridly in that flaming focus, glowing with a nacreous, opalescent green\nlight.\n\n\"Well, nothing much to see there--let's go down,\" remarked Seaton as he\nshot the _Skylark_ over to the edge of the island and down to the\nsurface of the water. But here again nothing was to be seen of the land\nitself. The wall was one vertical plate of seamless metal, supporting\nhuge metal guides, between which floated metal pontoons. From these\ngigantic floats metal girders and trusses went through slots in the wall\ninto the darkness of the interior. Close scrutiny revealed that the\nlarge floats were rising steadily, although very slowly; while smaller\nfloats bobbed up and down upon each passing wave.\n\n\"Solar generators, tide-motors, and wave-motors, all at once!\"\nejaculated Seaton. \"_Some_ power-plant! Folks, I'm going to take a look\nat that if I have to drill in with a ray!\"\n\n[Illustration: Some power plant! Folks, I'm going to take a look at\nthat....]\n\nThey circumnavigated the island without revealing any door or other\nopening--the entire thirty miles was one stupendous battery of the\ngenerators. Back at the starting point, the _Skylark_ hopped over the\nstructure and down to the surface of the small central lagoon previously\nnoticed. Close to the water, it was seen that there was plenty of room\nfor the vessel to move about beneath the roof of reflectors, and that\nthe island was one solid stand of tide-motors. At one end of the lagoon\nwas an open metal structure, the only building visible, and Seaton\nbrought the space-cruiser up to it and through the huge opening--for\ndoor there was none. The interior of the room was lighted by long,\ntubular lights running around in front of the walls, which were\nveritable switchboards. Row after row and tier upon tier stood the\ninstruments, plainly electrical meters of enormous capacity and equally\nplainly in full operation, but no wiring or bus-bar could be seen.\nBefore each row of instruments there was a narrow walk, with steps\nleading down into the water of the lagoon. Every part of the great room\nwas plainly visible, and not a living being was even watching that vast\ninstrument-board.\n\n\"What do you make of it, Dick?\" asked Crane, slowly.\n\n\"No wiring--tight beam transmission. The Fenachrone do it with two\nmatched-frequency separable units. Millions and millions of kilowatts\nthere, if I'm any judge. Absolutely automatic too, or else----\" Seaton's\nvoice died away.\n\n\"Or else what?\" asked Dorothy.\n\n\"Just a hunch. I wouldn't wonder if----\"\n\n\"Hold it, Dicky! Remember I had to put you to bed after that last hunch\nyou had!\"\n\n\"Here it is, anyway. Mart, what would be the logical line of evolution\nwhen the planet has become so old that all the land has been eroded to a\nlevel below that of the ocean? You picked us out an old one, all\nright--so old that there's no land left. Would a highly civilized people\nrevert to fish? That seems like a backward move to me, but what other\nanswer is possible?\"\n\n\"Probably not to true fishes--although they might easily develop some\nfish-like traits. I do not believe, however, that they would go back to\ngills or to cold blood.\"\n\n\"What _are_ you two saying?\" interrupted Margaret. \"Do you mean to say\nthat you think _fish_ live here instead of people, and that _fish_ did\nall this?\" as she waved her hand at the complicated machinery about\nthem.\n\n\"Not fish exactly, no.\" Crane paused in thought. \"Merely a people who\nhave adjusted themselves to their environment through conscious or\nnatural selection. We had a talk about this very thing in our first\ntrip, shortly after I met you. Remember? I commented on the fact that\nthere must be life throughout the Universe, much of it that we could not\nunderstand; and you replied that there would be no reason to suppose\nthem awful because incomprehensible. That may be the case here.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm going to find out,\" declared Seaton, as he appeared with a\nbox full of coils, tubes, and other apparatus.\n\n\"How?\" asked Dorothy, curiously.\n\n\"Fix me up a detector and follow up one of those beams. Find its\nfrequency and direction, first, you know, then pick it up outside and\nfollow it to where it's going. It'll go through anything, of course, but\nI can trap off enough of it to follow it, even if it's tight enough to\nchoke itself,\" said Seaton.\n\n\"That's one thing I got from that brain record.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe worked deftly and rapidly, and soon was rewarded by a flaring crimson\ncolor in his detector when it was located in one certain position in\nfront of one of the meters. Noting the bearing on the great circles, he\nthen moved the _Skylark_ along that exact line, over the reflectors, and\nout beyond the island, where he allowed the vessel to settle directly\ndownwards.\n\n\"Now folks, if I've done this just right, we'll get a red flash\ndirectly.\"\n\nAs he spoke the detector again burst into crimson light, and he set the\nbar into the line and applied a little power, keeping the light at its\nreddest while the other three looked on in fascinated interest.\n\n\"This beam is on something that's moving, Mart--can't take my eyes off\nit for a second or I'll lose it entirely. See where we're going, will\nyou?\"\n\n\"We are about to strike the water,\" replied Crane quietly.\n\n\"The water!\" exclaimed Margaret.\n\n\"Fair enough--why not?\"\n\n\"Oh, that's right--I forgot that the _Skylark_ is as good a submarine as\nshe is an airship.\"\n\nCrane pointed number six visiplate directly into the line of flight and\nstarted into the dark water.\n\n\"Mow deep are we, Mart?\" asked Seaton after a time.\n\n\"Only about a hundred feet, and we do not seem to be getting any\ndeeper.\"\n\n\"That's good. Afraid this beam might be going to a station on the other\nside of the planet--through the ground. If so, we'd have had to go back\nand trace another. We can follow it any distance under water, but not\nthrough rock. Need a light?\"\n\n\"Not unless we go deeper.\"\n\nFor two hours Seaton held the detector upon that tight beam of energy,\ntraveling at a hundred miles an hour, the highest speed he could use and\nstill hold the beam.\n\n\"I'd like to be up above watching us. I bet we're making the water boil\nbehind us,\" remarked Dorothy.\n\n\"Yeah, we're kicking up quite a wake, I guess. It sure takes power to\ndrive the old can through this wetness.\"\n\n\"Slow down!\" commanded Crane. \"I see a submarine ahead. I thought it\nmight be a whale at first, but it is a boat and it is what we are aiming\nfor. You are constantly swinging with it, keeping it exactly in the\nline.\"\n\n\"O.K.\" Seaton reduced the power and swung the visiplate over in front of\nhim, whereupon the detector lamp went out. \"It's a relief to follow\nsomething I can see, instead of trying to guess which way that beam's\ngoing to wiggle next. Lead on, Macduff--I'm right on your tail!\"\n\nThe _Skylark_ fell in behind the submersible craft, close enough to keep\nit plainly visible in the telescopic visiplate. Finally the stranger\nstopped and rose to the surface between two rows of submerged pontoons\nwhich, row upon row, extended in every direction as far as the telescope\ncould reach.\n\n\"Well, Dot, we're where we're going, wherever that is.\"\n\n\"What do you suppose it is? It looks like a floating isleport, like what\nit told about in that wild-story magazine you read so much.\"\n\n\"Maybe--but if so they can't be fish,\" answered Seaton. \"Let's go--I\nwant to look it over,\" and water flew in all directions as the _Skylark_\nburst out of the ocean and leaped into the air far above what was in\ntruth a floating city.\n\nRectangular in shape, it appeared to be about six miles long and four\nwide. It was roofed with solar generators like those covering the island\njust visited, but the machines were not spaced quite so closely\ntogether, and there were numerous open lagoons. The water around the\nentire city was covered with wave-motors. From their great height the\nvisitors could see an occasional submarine moving slowly under the city,\nand frequently small surface craft dashed across the lagoons. As they\nwatched, a seaplane with short, thick wings curved like those of a gull,\nrose from one of the lagoons and shot away over the water.\n\n\"Quite a place,\" remarked Seaton as he swung a visiplate upon one of the\nlagoons. \"Submarines, speedboats, and fast seaplanes. Fish or not,\nthey're not so slow. I'm going to grab off one of those folks and see\nhow much they know. Wonder if they're peaceable or warlike?\"\n\n\"They look peaceable, but you know the proverb,\" Crane cautioned his\nimpetuous friend.\n\n\"Yes, and I'm going to be timid like a mice,\" Seaton returned as the\n_Skylark_ dropped rapidly toward a lagoon near the edge of the island.\n\n\"You ought to put that in a gag book, Dick,\" Dorothy chuckled. \"You\nforget all about being timid until an hour afterwards.\"\n\n\"Watch me, Red-top! If they even point a finger at us, I'm going to run\na million miles a minute.\"\n\nNo hostile demonstration was made as they dropped lower and lower,\nhowever, and Seaton, with one hand upon the switch actuating the zone of\nforce, slowly lowered the vessel down past the reflectors and to the\nsurface of the water. Through the visiplate he saw the crowd of people\ncoming toward them--some swimming in the lagoon, some walking along\nnarrow runways. They seemed to be of all sizes, and unarmed.\n\n\"I believe they're perfectly peaceable, and just curious, Mart. I've\nalready got the repellers on close range--believe I'll cut them off\naltogether.\"\n\n\"How about the ray-screens?\"\n\n\"All three full out. They don't interfere with anything solid, though,\nand won't hurt anything. They'll stop any ray attack and this arenak\nhull will stop anything else we are apt to get there. Watch this board,\nwill you, and I'll see if I can't negotiate with them.\"\n\nSeaton opened the door. As he did so, a number of the smaller beings\ndived headlong into the water, and a submarine rose quietly to the\nsurface less than fifty feet away with a peculiar tubular weapon and a\nhuge ray-generator trained upon the _Skylark_. Seaton stood motionless,\nhis right hand raised in the universal sign of peace, his left holding\nat his hip an automatic pistol charged with X-plosive shells--while\nCrane, at the controls, had the Fenachrone super-generator in line, and\nhis hand lay upon the switch, whose closing would volatilize the\nsubmarine and cut an incandescent path of destruction through the city\nlengthwise.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter a moment of inaction, a hatch opened, a man stepped out upon the\ndeck of the submarine, and the two tried to converse, but with no\nsuccess. Seaton then brought out the mechanical educator, held it up for\nthe other's inspection, and waved an invitation to come aboard.\nInstantly the other dived, and came to the surface immediately below\nSeaton, who assisted him into the _Skylark_. Tall and heavy as Seaton\nwas, the stranger was half a head taller and almost twice as heavy. His\nthick skin was of the characteristic Osnomian green and his eyes were\nthe usual black, but he had no hair whatever. His shoulders, though\nbroad and enormously strong, were very sloping, and his powerful arms\nwere little more than half as long as would have been expected had they\nbelonged to a human being of his size. The hands and feet were very\nlarge and very broad, and the fingers and toes were heavily webbed. His\nhigh domed forehead appeared even higher because of the total lack of\nhair, otherwise his features were regular and well-proportioned. He\ncarried himself easily and gracefully, and yet with the dignity of one\naccustomed to command as he stepped into the control room and saluted\ngravely the three other Earth-beings. He glanced quickly around the\nroom, and showed unmistakable pleasure as he saw the power-plant of the\ncruiser of space. Languages were soon exchanged and the stranger spoke,\nin a bass voice vastly deeper than Seaton's own.\n\n\"In the name of our city and planet--I may say in the name of our solar\nsystem, for you are very evidently from one other than our green\nsystem--I greet you. I would offer you refreshment, as is our custom,\nbut I fear that your chemistry is but ill adapted to our customary fare.\nIf there be aught in which we can be of assistance to you, our resources\nare at your disposal--but before you leave us, I shall wish to ask from\nyou a great gift.\"\n\n\"Sir, we thank you. We are in search of knowledge concerning forces\nwhich we cannot as yet control. From the power systems you employ, and\nfrom what I have learned of the composition of your suns and planets, I\nassume you have none of the metal of power, and it is a quantity of that\nelement that is your greatest need?\"\n\n\"Yes. Power is our only lack. We generate all we can with the materials\nand knowledge at our disposal, but we never have enough. Our development\nis hindered, our birth-rate must be held down to a minimum, many new\ncities which we need cannot be built and many new projects cannot be\nstarted, all for lack of power. For one gram of that metal I see plated\nupon that copper cylinder, of whose very existence no scientist upon\nDasor has had even an inkling, we would do almost anything. In fact, if\nall else failed, I would be tempted to attack you, did I not know that\nour utmost power could not penetrate even your outer screen, and that\nyou could volatilize the entire planet if you so desired.\"\n\n\"Great Cat!\" In his surprise Seaton lapsed from the formal language he\nhad been employing. \"Have you figured us all out already, from a\nstanding start?\"\n\n\"We know electricity, chemistry, physics, and mathematics fairly well.\nYou see, our race is many millions of years older than is yours.\"\n\n\"You're the man I've been looking for, I guess,\" said Seaton. \"We have\nenough of this metal with us so that we can spare you some as well as\nnot. But before you get it, I'll introduce you. Folks, this is Sacner\nCarfon, Chief of the Council of the planet Dasor. They saw us all the\ntime, and when we headed for this, the Sixth City, he came over from the\ncapital, or First City, in the flagship of his police fleet, to welcome\nus or to fight us, as we pleased. Carfon, this is Martin Crane--or say,\nbetter than introductions, put on the headsets, everybody, and get\nacquainted right.\"\n\nAcquaintance made and the apparatus put away, Seaton went to one of the\nstore-rooms and brought out a lump of \"X,\" weighing about a hundred\npounds.\n\n\"There's enough to build power-plants from now on. It would save time if\nyou were to dismiss your submarine. With you to pilot us, we can take\nyou back to the First City a lot faster than your vessel can travel.\"\n\nCarfon took a miniature transmitter from a pouch under his arm and spoke\nbriefly, then gave Seaton the course. In a few minutes, the First City\nwas reached, and the _Skylark_ descended rapidly to the surface of a\nlagoon at one end of the city. Short as had been the time consumed by\ntheir journey from the Sixth City, they found a curious and excited\ncrowd awaiting them. The central portion of the lagoon was almost\ncovered by the small surface craft, while the sides, separated from the\nsidewalks by the curbs, were full of swimmers. The peculiar Dasorian\nequivalents of whistles, bells, and gongs were making a deafening\nuproar, and the crowd was yelling and cheering in much the same fashion\nas do earthly crowds upon similar occasions. Seaton stopped the\n_Skylark_ and took his wife by the shoulder, swinging her around in\nfront of the visiplate.\n\n\"Look at that, Dot. Talk about rapid transit! They could give the New\nYork subway a flying start and beat them hands down!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDorothy looked into the visiplate and gasped. Six metal pipes, one above\nthe other, ran above and parallel to each sidewalk-lane of water. The\npipes were full of ocean water, water racing along at fully fifty miles\nan hour and discharging, each stream a small waterfall, into the lagoon.\nEach pipe was lighted in the interior, and each was full of people,\nheads almost touching feet, unconcernedly being borne along, completely\nimmersed in that mad current. As the passenger saw daylight and felt the\nstream begin to drop, he righted himself, apparently selecting an\nobjective point, and rode the current down into the ocean. A few quick\nstrokes, and he was either at the surface or upon one of the flights of\nstairs leading up to the platform. Many of the travelers did not even\nmove as they left the orifice. If they happened to be on their backs,\nthey entered the ocean backward and did not bother about righting\nthemselves or about selecting a destination until they were many feet\nbelow the surface.\n\n\"Good heavens, Dick! They'll kill themselves or drown!\"\n\n\"Not these birds. Notice their skins? They've got a hide like a walrus,\nand a terrific layer of subcutaneous fat. Even their heads are protected\nthat way--you could hardly hit one of them enough with a baseball bat to\nhurt him. And as for drowning--they can out-swim a fish, and can stay\nunder water almost an hour without coming up for air. Even one of those\nyoungsters can swim the full length of the city without taking a\nbreath.\"\n\n\"How do you get that velocity of flow, Carfon?\" asked Crane.\n\n\"By means of pumps. These channels run all over the city, and the amount\nof water running in each tube and the number of tubes in use are\nregulated automatically by the amount of traffic. When any section of\ntube is empty of people, no water flows through it. This was necessary\nin order to save power. At each intersection there are four stand pipes\nand automatic swim-counters that regulate the volume of water and the\nnumber of tubes in use. This is ordinarily a quiet pool, as it is in a\nresidence section, and this channel--our channels correspond to your\nstreets, you know--has only six tubes each way. If you will look on the\nother side of the channel, you will see the intake end of the tubes\ngoing down-town.\"\n\nSeaton swung the visiplate around and they saw six rapidly-moving\nstairways, each crowded with people, leading from the ocean level up to\nthe top of a tall metal tower. As the passengers reached the top of the\nflight they were catapulted head-first into the chamber leading to the\ntube below.\n\n\"Well, that is some system for handling people!\" exclaimed Seaton.\n\"What's the capacity of the system?\"\n\n\"When running full pressure, six tubes will handle five thousand people\na minute. It is only very rarely, on such occasions as this, that they\nare ever loaded to capacity. Some of the channels in the middle of the\ncity have as many as twenty tubes, so that it is always possible to go\nfrom one end of the city to the other in less than ten minutes.\"\n\n\"Don't they ever jam?\" asked Dorothy curiously. \"I've been lost more\nthan once in the New York subway, and been in some perfectly frightful\njams, too--and they weren't moving ten thousand people a minute either.\"\n\n\"No jams ever have occurred. The tubes are perfectly smooth and\nwell-lighted, and all turns and intersections are rounded. The\ncontrolling machines allow only so many persons to enter any tube--if\nmore should try to enter than can be carried comfortably, the surplus\npassengers are slid off down a chute to the swim-ways, or sidewalks, and\nmay either wait a while or swim to the next intersection.\"\n\n\"That looks like quite a jam down there now.\" Seaton pointed to the\nreceiving pool, which was now one solid mass except for the space kept\nclear by the six mighty streams of humanity-laden water.\n\n\"If the newcomers can't find room to come to the surface they'll swim\nover to some other pool.\" Carfon shrugged indifferently. \"My residence\nis the fifth cubicle on the right side of this channel. Our custom\ndemands that you accept the hospitality of my home, if only for a moment\nand only for a beaker of distilled water. Any ordinary visitor could be\nreceived in my office, but you must enter my home.\"\n\nSeaton steered the _Skylark_ carefully, surrounded as she was by a\ntightly packed crowd of swimmers, to the indicated dwelling, and\nanchored her so that one of the doors was close to a flight of steps\nleading from the corner of the building down into the water. Carfon\nstepped out, opened the door of his house, and preceded his guests\nwithin. The room was large and square, and built of a synthetic,\nnon-corroding metal, as was the entire city. The walls were tastefully\ndecorated with striking geometrical designs in many-colored metal, and\nupon the floor was a softly woven rug. Three doors leading into other\nrooms could be seen, and strange pieces of furniture stood here and\nthere. In the center of the floor-space was a circular opening some four\nfeet in diameter, and there, only a few inches below the level of the\nfloor, was the surface of the ocean.\n\nCarfon introduced his guests to his wife--a feminine replica of himself,\nalthough she was not of quite such heroic proportions.\n\n\"I don't suppose that Seven is far away, is he?\" Carfon asked of the\nwoman.\n\n\"Probably he is outside, near the flying ball. If he has not been\ntouching it ever since it came down, it is only because someone\nstronger than he pushed him aside. You know how boys are,\" turning to\nDorothy with a smile as she spoke, \"boy nature is probably universal.\"\n\n\"Pardon my curiosity, but why 'Seven'?\" asked Dorothy, as she returned\nthe smile.\n\n\"He is the two thousand three hundred and forty-seventh Sacner Carfon in\ndirect male line of descent,\" she explained. \"But perhaps Six has not\nexplained these things to you. Our population must not be allowed to\nincrease, therefore each couple can have only two children. It is\ncustomary for the boy to be born first, and is given the name of his\nfather. The girl is younger, and is given her mother's name.\"\n\n\"That will now be changed,\" said Carfon feelingly. \"These visitors have\ngiven us the secret of power, and we shall be able to build new cities\nand populate Dasor as she should he populated.\"\n\n\"Really?----\" She checked herself, but a flame leaped to her eyes, and\nher voice was none too steady as she addressed the visitors. \"For that\nwe Dasorians thank you more than words can express. Perhaps you\nstrangers do not know what it means to want a dozen children with every\nfiber of your being and to be allowed to have only two--we do, all too\nwell--I will call Seven.\"\n\nShe pressed a button, and up out of the opening in the middle of the\nfloor there shot a half-grown boy, swimming so rapidly that he scarcely\ntouched the coaming as he came to his feet. He glanced at the four\nvisitors, then ran up to Seaton and Crane.\n\n\"Please, sirs, may I ride, just a little short ride, in your vessel\nbefore you go away?\" This was said in their language.\n\n\"Seven!\" boomed Carfon sternly, and the exuberant youth subsided.\n\n\"Pardon me, sirs, but I was so excited----\"\n\n\"All right, son, no harm done at all. You bet you'll have a ride in the\n_Skylark_ if your parents will let you.\" He turned to Carfon. \"I'm not\nso far beyond that stage myself that I'm not in sympathy with him.\nNeither are you, unless I'm badly mistaken.\"\n\n\"I am very glad that you feel as you do. He would be delighted to\naccompany us down to the office, and it will be something to remember\nall the rest of his life.\"\n\n\"You have a little girl, too?\" Dorothy asked the woman.\n\n\"Yes--would you like to see her? She is asleep now,\" and without waiting\nfor an answer, the proud Dasorian mother led the way into a bedroom--a\nbedroom without beds, for Dasorians sleep floating in thermostatically\ncontrolled tanks, buoyed up in water of the temperature they like best,\nin a fashion that no Earthly springs and mattresses can approach. In a\nsmall tank in a corner reposed a baby, apparently about a year old, over\nwhom Dorothy and Margaret made the usual feminine ceremony of delight\nand approbation.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBack in the living room, after an animated conversation in which much\ninformation was exchanged concerning the two planets and their races of\npeoples, Carfon drew six metal goblets of distilled water and passed\nthem around. Standing in a circle, the six touched goblets and drank.\n\nThey then embarked, and while Crane steered the _Skylark_ slowly along\nthe channel toward the offices of the Council, and while Dorothy and\nMargaret showed the eager Seven all over the vessel, Seaton explained to\nCarfon the danger that threatened the Universe, what he had done, and\nwhat he was attempting to do.\n\n\"Doctor Seaton, I wish to apologize to you,\" the Dasorian said when\nSeaton had done. \"Since you are evidently still land animals, I had\nsupposed you of inferior intelligence. It is true that your younger\ncivilization is deficient in certain respects, but you have shown a\ndepth of vision, a sheer power of imagination and grasp, that no member\nof our older civilization could approach. I believe that you are right\nin your conclusions. We have no such rays nor forces upon this planet,\nand never have had; but the sixth planet of our own sun has. Less than\nfifty of your years ago, when I was but a small boy, such a projection\nvisited my father. It offered to 'rescue' us from our watery planet, and\nto show us how to build rocket-ships to move us to Three, which is half\nland, inhabited by lower animals.\"\n\n\"And he didn't accept?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. Then as now our sole lack was power, and the strangers\ndid not show us how to increase our supply. Perhaps they had more power\nthan we, perhaps, because of the difficulty of communication, our want\nwas not made clear to them. But, of course, we did not want to move to\nThree, and we had already had rocket-ships for hundreds of generations.\nWe have never been able to reach Six with them, but we visited Three\nlong ago; and every one who went there came back as soon as he could. We\ndetest land. It is hard, barren, unfriendly. We have everything, here\nupon Dasor. Food is plentiful, synthetic or natural, as we prefer. Our\nwatery planet supplies our every need and wish, with one exception; and\nnow that we are assured of power, even that one exception vanishes, and\nDasor becomes a very Paradise. We can now lead our natural lives, work\nand play to our fullest capacity--we would not trade our world for all\nthe rest of the Universe.\"\n\n\"I never thought of it in that way, but you're right, at that,\" Seaton\nconceded. \"You are ideally suited to your environment. But how do I get\nto planet Six? Its distance is terrific, even as cosmic distances go.\nYou won't have any night until Dasor swings outside the orbit of your\nsun, and until then Six will be invisible, even to our most powerful\ntelescope.\"\n\n\"I do not know, myself,\" answered Carfon, \"but I will send out a call\nfor the chief astronomer. He will meet us, and give you a chart and the\nexact course.\"\n\nAt the office, the earthly visitors were welcomed formally by the\nCouncil--the nine men in control of the entire planet. The ceremony over\nand their course carefully plotted, Carfon stood at the door of the\n_Skylark_ a moment before it closed.\n\n\"We thank you with all force, Earthmen, for what you have done for us\nthis day. Please remember, and believe that this is no idle word--if we\ncan assist you in any way in this conflict which is to come, the\nresources of this planet are at your disposal. We join Osnome and the\nother planets of this system in declaring you, Doctor Seaton, our\nOverlord.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nThe Welcome to Norlamin\n\n\nThe _Skylark_ was now days upon her way toward the sixth planet, Seaton\ngave the visiplates and the instrument board his customary careful\nscrutiny and rejoined the others.\n\n\"Still talking about the human fish, Dottie Dimple?\" he asked, as he\nstoked his villainous pipe. \"Peculiar tribe of porpoises, but I'm strong\nfor 'em. They're the most like our own kind of folks, as far as ideas\ngo, of anybody we've seen yet--in fact, they're more like us than a lot\nof human beings we all know.\"\n\n\"I like them immensely----\"\n\n\"You couldn't like 'em any other way, their size----\"\n\n\"Terrible, Dick, terrible! Easy as I am, I can't stand for any such joke\nas that was going to be. But really, I think they're just perfectly\nfine, in spite of their being so funny-looking. Mrs. Carfon is just\nsimply sweet, even if she does look like a walrus, and that cute little\nseal of a baby was just too perfectly cunning for words. That boy Seven\nis keen as mustard, too.\"\n\n\"He should be,\" put in Crane, dryly. \"He probably has as much\nintelligence now as any one of us.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" asked Margaret. \"He acted like any other boy, but he\ndid seem to understand things remarkably well.\"\n\n\"He would--they're 'way ahead of us in most things.\" Seaton glanced at\nthe two women quizzically and turned to Crane. \"And as for their being\nbald, this was one time, Mart, when those two phenomenal heads of hair\nour two little girl-friends are so proud of didn't make any kind of hit\nat all. They probably regard that black thatch of Peg's and Dot's auburn\nmop as relics of a barbarous and prehistoric age--about as we would\nregard the hirsute hide of a Neanderthal man.\"\n\n\"That may be so, too,\" Dorothy replied, unconcernedly, \"but we aren't\nplanning on living there, so why worry about it? I like them, anyway,\nand I believe that they like us.\"\n\n\"They acted that way. But say, Mart, if that planet is so old that all\ntheir land area has been eroded away, how come they've got so much water\nleft? And they've got quite an atmosphere, too.\"\n\n\"The air-pressure,\" said Crane, \"while greater than that now obtaining\nupon Earth, was probably of the order of magnitude of three meters of\nmercury, originally. As to the erosion, they might have had more water\nto begin with than our Earth had.\"\n\n\"Yeah, that'd account for it, all right,\" said Dorothy.\n\n\"There's one thing I want to ask you two scientists,\" Margaret said.\n\"Everywhere we've gone, except on that one world that Dick thinks is a\nwandering planet, we've found the intelligent life quite remarkably like\nhuman beings. How do you account for that?\"\n\n\"There, Mart, is one for the massive old bean to concentrate on,\"\nchallenged Seaton: then, as Crane considered the question in silence for\nsome time he went on: \"I'll answer it myself, then, by asking another.\nWhy not? Why shouldn't they be? Remember, man is the highest form of\nearthly life--at least, in our own opinion and as far as we know. In our\nwanderings, we have picked out planets quite similar to our own in point\nof atmosphere and temperature and, within narrow limits, of mass as\nwell. It stands to reason that under such similarity of conditions,\nthere would be a certain similarity of results. How about it, Mart?\nReasonable?\"\n\n\"It seems plausible, in a way,\" conceded Crane, \"but it probably is not\nuniversally true.\"\n\n\"Sure not--couldn't be, hardly. No doubt we could find a lot of worlds\ninhabited by all kinds of intelligent things--freaks that we can't even\nbegin to imagine now--but they probably would be occupying planets\nentirely different from ours in some essential feature of atmosphere,\ntemperature, or mass.\"\n\n\"But the Fenachrone world is entirely different,\" Dorothy argued, \"and\nthey're more or less human--they're bipeds, anyway, with recognizable\nfeatures. I've been studying that record with you, you know, and their\nworld has so much more mass than ours that their gravitation is simply\nfrightful!\"\n\n\"That much difference is comparatively slight, not a real fundamental\ndifference. I meant a hundred or so times either way--greater or less.\nAnd even their gravitation has modified their structure a lot--suppose\nit had been fifty times as great as it is? What would they have been\nlike? Also, their atmosphere is very similar to ours in composition, and\ntheir temperature is bearable. It is my opinion that atmosphere and\ntemperature have more to do with evolution than anything else, and that\nthe mass of the planet runs a poor third.\"\n\n\"You may be right,\" admitted Crane, \"but it seems to me that you are\narguing from insufficient premises.\"\n\n\"Sure I am--almost no premises at all. I would be just about as well\njustified in deducing the structure of a range of mountains from a\nsuperficial study of three pebbles picked up in a creek near them.\nHowever, we can get an idea some time, when we have a lot of time.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Remember that planet we struck on the first trip, that had an\natmosphere composed mostly of gaseous chlorin? In our ignorance we\nassumed that life there was impossible, and didn't stop. Well, it may be\njust as well that we didn't. If we go back there, protected as we are\nwith our rays and stuff, it wouldn't surprise me a bit to find life\nthere, and lots of it--and I've got a hunch that it'll be a form of life\nthat'd make your grandfather's whiskers curl right up into a ball!\"\n\n\"You do get the weirdest ideas, Dick!\" protested Dorothy. \"I hope you\naren't planning on exploring it, just to prove your point?\"\n\n\"Never thought of it before. Can't do it now, anyway--got our hands full\nalready. However, after we get this Fenachrone mess cleaned up we'll\nhave to do just that little thing, won't we, Mart? As that intellectual\nguy said while he was insisting upon dematerializing us, 'Science\ndemands it.'\"\n\n\"By all means. We should be in a position to make contributions to\nscience in fields as yet untouched. Most assuredly we shall investigate\nthose points.\"\n\n\"Then they'll go alone, won't they, Peggy?\"\n\n\"Absolutely! We've seen some pretty middling horrible things already,\nand if these two men of ours call the frightful things we have seen\nnormal, and are planning on deliberately hunting up things that even\nthey will consider monstrous, you and I most certainly shall stay at\nhome!\"\n\n\"Yeah? You say it easy. Bounce back, Peg, you've struck a rubber fence!\nRufus, you red-headed little fraud, you know you wouldn't let me go to\nthe corner store after a can of tobacco without insisting on tagging\nalong!\"\n\n\"You're a....\" began Dorothy hotly, but broke off in amazement and\ngasped, \"For Heaven's sake, what was that?\"\n\n\"What was what? It missed me.\"\n\n\"It went right through you! It was a kind of funny little cloud, like\nsmoke or something. It came right through the ceiling like a\nflash--went right through you and on down through the floor. There it\ncomes back again!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBefore their staring eyes a vague, nebulous something moved rapidly\nupward through the floor and passed upward through the ceiling. Dorothy\nleaped to Seaton's side and he put his arm around her reassuringly.\n\n\"'Sall right folks--I know what that thing is.\"\n\n\"Well, shoot it, quick!\" Dorothy implored.\n\n\"It's one of those projections from where we're heading for, trying to\nget our range; and it's the most welcome sight these weary old eyes have\nrested upon for full many a long and dreary moon. They've probably\nlocated us from our power-plant rays. We're an awful long ways off yet,\nthough, and going like a streak of greased lightning, so they're having\ntrouble in holding us. They're friendly, we already know that--they\nprobably want to talk to us. It'd make it easier for them if we'd shut\noff our power and drift at constant velocity, but we'd use up valuable\ntime and throw our calculations all out of whack. We'll let them try to\nmatch our acceleration If they can do that, they're good.\"\n\nThe apparition reappeared, oscillating back and forth\nirregularly--passing through the arenak walls, through the furniture and\nthe instrument boards, and even through the mighty power-plant itself,\nas though nothing was there. Eventually, however, it remained stationary\na foot or so above the floor of the control-room. Then it began to\nincrease in density until apparently a man stood before them. His skin,\nlike that of all the inhabitants of the planets of the green suns, was\ngreen. He was tall and well-proportioned when judged by Earthly\nstandards, except for his head, which was overly large, and which was\nparticularly massive above the eyes and backward from the ears. He was\nevidently of great age, for what little of his face was visible was\nseamed and wrinkled, and his long, thick mane of hair and his\nsquare-cut, yard-long beard were a dazzling white, only faintly tinged\nwith green.\n\nWhile not in any sense transparent, nor even translucent, it was evident\nthat the apparition before them was not composed of flesh and blood. He\nlooked at each of the four Earth-beings intensely for a moment, then\npointed toward the table upon which stood the mechanical educator, and\nSeaton placed it in front of the peculiar visitor. As Seaton donned a\nheadset and handed one to the stranger, the latter stared at him,\nimpressing upon his consciousness that he was to be given a knowledge of\nEnglish. Seaton pressed the lever, receiving as he did so a sensation of\nan unbroken calm, a serenity profound and untroubled, and the projection\nspoke.\n\n\"Dr. Seaton, Mr. Crane, and ladies--welcome to Norlamin, the planet\ntoward which you are now flying. We have been awaiting you for more than\nfive thousand years of your time. It has been a mathematical\ncertainty--it has been graven upon the very Sphere itself--that in time\nsomeone would come to us from without this system, bringing a portion,\nhowever small, of Rovolon--of the metal of power, of which there is not\neven the most minute trace in our entire solar system. For more than\nfive thousand years our instruments have been set to detect the\nvibrations which would herald the advent of the user of that metal. Now\nyou have come, and I perceive that you have vast stores of it. Being\nyourselves seekers after truth, you will share it with us gladly as we\nwill instruct you in many things you wish to know. Allow me to operate\nthe educator--I would gaze into your minds and reveal my own to your\nsight. But first I must tell you that your machine is too rudimentary to\nwork at all well, and with your permission I shall make certain minor\nalterations.\"\n\nSeaton nodded permission, and from the eyes and from the hands of the\nfigure there leaped visible streams of force, which seized the\ntransformers, coils and tubes, and reformed and reconnected them, under\nSeaton's bulging eyes, into an entirely different mechanism.\n\n\"Oh, I see!\" he gasped. \"Say, what are you anyway?\"\n\n\"Pardon me; in my eagerness I became forgetful. I am Orlon, the First of\nAstronomy of Norlamin, in my observatory upon the surface of the planet.\nThis that you see is simply my projection, composed of forces for which\nyou have no name in your language. You can cut it off, if you wish, with\nyour ray-screens, which even I can see are of a surprisingly high order\nof efficiency. There, this educator will now work very well. Please put\non the remodeled headsets, all four of you.\"\n\nThey did so, and the rays of force moved levers, switches, and dials as\npositively as human hands could have moved them, and with infinitely\ngreater speed and precision. As the dials moved, each brain received\nclearly and plainly a knowledge of the customs, language, and manners of\nthe inhabitants of Norlamin. Each mind became suffused with a vast,\nimmeasurable peace, calm power, and a depth and breadth of mental vision\ntheretofore undreamed of. Looking deep into his mind they sensed a\nquiet, placid certainty, beheld power and knowledge to them illimitable,\nperceived depths of wisdom to them unfathomable.\n\nThen from his mind into theirs there flowed smoothly a mighty stream of\ncomprehension of cosmic phenomena. They hazily saw infinitely small\nunits grouped into planetary formations to form practically\ndimensionless particles. These particles in turn grouped to form\nslightly larger ones, and after a long succession of such grouping they\nknew that the comparatively gigantic aggregates which then held their\nattention were in reality electrons and protons, the smallest units\nrecognized by Earthly science. They clearly understood the combination\nof these electrons and protons into atoms. They perceived plainly the\nway in which atoms build up molecules, and comprehended the molecular\nstructure of matter. In mathematical thoughts, only dimly grasped even\nby Seaton and Crane, were laid before them the fundamental laws of\nphysics, of electricity, of gravitation, and of chemistry. They saw\nglobular aggregations of matter, the suns and their planets, comprising\nsolar systems; saw solar systems, in accordance with those immutable\nlaws, grouped into galaxies, galaxies in turn--here the flow was\nsuddenly shut off as though a valve had been closed, and the astronomer\nspoke.\n\n\"Pardon me. Your brains should be stored only with the material you\ndesire most and can use to the best advantage, for your mental capacity\nis even more limited than my own. Please understand that I speak in no\nderogatory sense; it is only that your race has many thousands of\ngenerations to go before your minds should be stored with knowledge\nindiscriminately. We ourselves have not yet reached that stage, and we\nare perhaps millions of years older than you. And yet,\" he continued\nmusingly, \"I envy you. Knowledge is, of course, relative, and I can\nknow _so_ little! Time and space have yielded not an iota of their\nmystery to our most penetrant minds. And whether we delve baffled into\nthe unknown smallness of the small, or whether we peer, blind and\nhelpless, into the unknown largeness of the large, it is the\nsame--infinity is comprehensible only to the Infinite One: the\nall-shaping Force directing and controlling the Universe and the\nunknowable Sphere. The more we know, the vaster the virgin fields of\ninvestigation open to us, and the more infinitesimal becomes our\nknowledge. But I am perhaps keeping you from more important activities.\nAs you approach Norlamin more nearly, I shall guide you to my\nobservatory. I am glad indeed that it is in my lifetime that you have\ncome to us, and I await anxiously the opportunity of greeting you in the\nflesh. The years remaining to me of this cycle of existence are few, and\nI had almost ceased hoping to witness your coming.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe projection vanished instantaneously, and the four stared at each\nother in an incredulous daze of astonishment. Seaton finally broke the\nstunned silence. \"Well, I'll be kicked to death by little red spiders!\"\nhe ejaculated. \"Mart, did you see what I saw, or did I get tight on\nsomething without knowing it? That sure burned me up--it breaks me right\noff at the ankles, just to think of it!\"\n\nCrane walked to the educator in silence. He examined it, felt the\nchanged coils and transformers, and gently shook the new insulating base\nof the great power-tube. Still in silence he turned his back, walked\naround the instrument board, read the meters, then went back and again\ninspected the educator.\n\n\"It was real, and not a higher development of hypnotism, as at first I\nthought it must be,\" he reported seriously. \"Hypnotism, if sufficiently\nadvanced, might have affected us in that fashion, even to teaching us\nall a strange language, but by no possibility could it have had such an\neffect upon copper, steel, bakelite, and glass. It was certainly real,\nand while I cannot begin to understand it, I will say that your\nimagination has certainly vindicated itself. A race of beings, who can\ndo such things as that, can do almost anything--you have been right,\nfrom the start.\"\n\n\"Then you can beat those horrible Fenachrone, after all!\" cried Dorothy,\nand threw herself into her husband's arms.\n\n\"Do you remember, Dick, that I hailed you once as Columbus at San\nSalvador?\" asked Margaret unsteadily from Crane's encircling arm. \"What\ncould a man be called who from the sheer depths of his imagination\ncalled forth the means of saving from destruction all the civilization\nof millions of entire worlds?\"\n\n\"Don't talk that way, please, folks,\" Seaton was plainly very\nuncomfortable. He blushed intensely, the burning red tide rising in\nwaves up to his hair as he wriggled in embarrassment, like any\nschoolboy. \"Mart's done most of it, anyway, you know; and even at that,\nwe ain't out of the woods yet, by forty-seven rows of apple trees.\"\n\n\"You will admit, will you not, that we can see our way out of the woods,\nat least, and that you yourself feel rather relieved?\" asked Crane.\n\n\"I think we'll be able to pull their corks now, all right, after we get\nsome dope. It's a cinch they've either got the stuff we need or know how\nto get it--and if that zone is impenetrable, I'll bet they'll be able to\ndope out something just as good. Relieved? That doesn't half tell it,\nguy--I feel as if I had just pitched off the Old Man of the Sea who's\nbeen sitting on my neck! What say you girls get your fiddle and guitar\nand we'll sing us a little song? I feel kind of relieved--they had me\nworried some--it's the first time I've felt like singing since we cut\nthat warship up.\"\n\nDorothy brought out her \"fiddle\"--the magnificent Stradivarius, formerly\nCrane's, which he had given her--Margaret her guitar, and they sang one\nrollicking number after another. Though by no means a Metropolitan Opera\nquartette, their voices were all better than mediocre, and they had sung\ntogether so much that they harmonized readily.\n\n\"Why don't you play us some real music, Dottie?\" asked Margaret, after a\ntime. \"You haven't practiced for ages.\"\n\n\"I haven't felt like playing lately, but I do now,\" and Dorothy stood up\nand swept the bow over the strings. Doctor of Music in violin, an\naccomplished musician, playing upon one of the finest instruments the\nworld has ever known, she was lifted out of herself by relief from the\ndread of the Fenachrone invasion and that splendid violin expressed\nevery subtle nuance of her thought.\n\nShe played rhapsodies and paeans, and solos by the great masters. She\nplayed vivacious dances, then \"Traumerei\" and \"Liebestraum.\" At last she\nswept into the immortal \"Meditation,\" and as the last note died away\nSeaton held out his arms.\n\n\"You're a blinding flash and a deafening report, Dottie Dimple, and I\nlove you,\" he declared--and his eyes and his arms spoke volumes that his\nlight utterance had left unsaid.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNorlamin close enough so that its image almost filled number six\nvisiplate, the four wanderers studied it with interest. Partially\nobscured by clouds and with its polar regions two glaring caps of\nsnow--they would be green in a few months, when the planet would swing\ninside the orbit of its sun around the vast central luminary of that\ncomplex solar system--it made a magnificent picture. They saw sparkling\nblue oceans and huge green continents of unfamiliar outlines. So\nterrific was the velocity of the space-cruiser, that the image grew\nlarger as they watched it, and soon the field of vision could not\ncontain the image of the whole disk.\n\n\"Well, I expect Orlon'll be showing up pretty quick now,\" remarked\nSeaton; and it was not long until the projection appeared in the air of\nthe control room.\n\n\"Hail, Terrestrials!\" he greeted them. \"With your permission, I shall\ndirect your flight.\"\n\nPermission granted, the figure floated across the room to the board and\nthe rays of force centered the visiplate, changed the direction of the\nbar a trifle, decreased slightly their negative acceleration, and\ndirected a stream of force upon the steering mechanism.\n\n\"We shall alight upon the grounds of my observatory upon Norlamin in\nseven thousand four hundred twenty-eight seconds,\" he announced\npresently. \"The observatory will be upon the dark side of Norlamin when\nwe arrive, but I have a force operating upon the steering mechanism\nwhich will guide the vessel along the required curved path. I shall\nremain with you until we land, and we may converse upon any topic of\nmost interest to you.\"\n\n\"We've got a topic of interest, all right. That's what we came out here\nfor. But it would take too long to tell you about it--I'll show you!\"\n\nHe brought out the magnetic brain record, threaded it into the machine\nand handed the astronomer a head-set. Orlon put it on, touched the\nlever, and for an hour there was unbroken silence as the monstrous brain\nof the menace was studied by the equally capable intellect of the\nNorlaminian scientist. There was no pause in the motion of the magnetic\ntape, no repetition--Orlon's brain absorbed the information as fast as\nit could be sent, and understood that frightful mind in every\nparticular.\n\nAs the end of the tape was reached and the awful record ended, a shadow\npassed over Orlon's face.\n\n\"Truly a depraved evolution--it is sad to contemplate such a perversion\nof a really excellent brain. They have power, even as you have, and they\nhave the will to destroy, which is a thing that I cannot understand.\nHowever, if it is graven upon the Sphere that we are to pass, it means\nonly that upon the next plane we shall continue our searches--let us\nhope with better tools and with greater understanding than we now\npossess.\"\n\n\"'Smatter?\" snapped Seaton gravely. \"Going to take it lying down,\nwithout putting up any fight at all?\"\n\n\"What can we do? Violence is contrary to our very natures. No man of\nNorlamin could offer any but passive resistance.\"\n\n\"You can do a lot if you will. Put on that headset again and get my\nplan, offering any suggestions your far abler brain may suggest.\"\n\nAs the human scientist poured his plan of battle into the brain of the\nastronomer, Orlon's face cleared.\n\n\"It is graven upon the Sphere that the Fenachrone shall pass,\" he said\nfinally. \"What you ask of us we can do. I have only a general knowledge\nof rays, as they are not in the province of the Orlon family; but the\nstudent Rovol, of the family Rovol of Rays, has all present knowledge of\nsuch phenomena. Tomorrow I will bring you together, and I have little\ndoubt that he will be able, with the help of your metal of power, to\nsolve your problem.\"\n\n\"I don't quite understand what you said about a whole family studying\none subject, and yet having only one student in it,\" said Dorothy, in\nperplexity.\n\n\"A little explanation is perhaps necessary,\" replied Orlon. \"First, you\nmust know that every man of Norlamin is a student, and most of us are\nstudents of science. With us, 'labor' means mental effort, that is,\nstudy. We perform no physical or manual labor save for exercise, as all\nour mechanical work is done by forces. This state of things having\nendured for many thousands of years, it long ago became evident that\nspecialization was necessary in order to avoid duplication of effort and\nto insure complete coverage of the field. Soon afterward, it was\ndiscovered that very little progress was being made in any branch,\nbecause so much was known that it took practically a lifetime to review\nthat which had already been accomplished, even in a narrow and highly\nspecialized field. Many points were studied for years before it was\ndiscovered that the identical work had been done before, and either\nforgotten or overlooked. To remedy this condition the mechanical\neducator had to be developed. Once it was perfected a new system was\nbegun. One man was assigned to each small subdivision of scientific\nendeavor, to study it intensively. When he became old, each man chose a\nsuccessor--usually a son--and transferred his own knowledge to the\nyounger student. He also made a complete record of his own brain, in\nmuch the same way as you have recorded the brain of the Fenachrone upon\nyour metallic tape. These records are all stored in a great central\nlibrary, as permanent references.\n\n\"All these things being true, now a young person may need only finish an\nelementary education--just enough to learn to think, which takes only\nabout twenty-five or thirty years--and then he is ready to begin actual\nwork. When that time comes, he receives in one day all the knowledge of\nhis specialty which has been accumulated by his predecessors during many\nthousands of years of intensive study.\"\n\n\"Whew!\" Seaton whistled, \"no wonder you folks know something! With that\nstart, I believe I might know something myself! As an astronomer, you\nmay be interested in this star-chart and stuff--or do you know all about\nthat already?\"\n\n\"No, the Fenachrone are far ahead of us in that subject, because of\ntheir observatories out in open space and because of their gigantic\nreflectors, which cannot be used through any atmosphere. We are further\nhampered in having darkness for only a few hours at a time and only in\nthe winter, when our planet is outside the orbit of our sun around the\ngreat central sun of our entire system. However, with the Rovolon you\nhave brought us, we shall have real observatories far out in space; and\nfor that I personally will be indebted to you more than I can ever\nexpress. As for the chart, I hope to have the pleasure of examining it\nwhile you are conferring with Rovol of Rays.\"\n\n\"How many families are working on rays--just one?\"\n\n\"One upon each kind of ray. That is, each of the ray families knows a\ngreat deal about all kinds of vibrations of the ether, but is\nspecializing upon one narrow field. Take, for instance, the rays you are\nmost interested in; those able to penetrate a zone of force. From my own\nvery slight and general knowledge I know that it would of necessity be a\nray of the fifth order. These rays are very new--they have been under\ninvestigation only a few hundred years--and the Rovol is the only\nstudent who would be at all well informed upon them. Shall I explain the\norders of rays more fully than I did by means of the educator?\"\n\n\"Please. You assumed that we knew more than we do, so a little\nexplanation would help.\"\n\n\"All ordinary vibrations--that is, all molecular and material ones, such\nas light, heat, electricity, radio, and the like--were arbitrarily\ncalled waves of the first order; in order to distinguish them from waves\nof the second order, which are given off by particles of the second\norder, which you know as protons and electrons, in their combination to\nform atoms. Your scientist Millikan discovered these rays for you, and\nin your language they are known as Millikan, or Cosmic, rays.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Some time later, when sub-electrons were identified the rays given off\nby their combination into electrons, or by the disruption of electrons,\nwere called rays of the third order. These rays are most interesting and\nmost useful; in fact, they do all our mechanical work. They as a class\nare called protelectricity, and bear the same relation to ordinary\nelectricity that electricity does to torque--both are pure energy, and\nthey are inter-convertible. Unlike electricity, however, it may be\nconverted into many different forms by fields of force, in a way\ncomparable to that in which white light is resolved into colors by a\nprism--or rather, more like the way alternating current is changed to\ndirect current by a motor-generator set, with attendant changes in\nproperties. There is a complete spectrum of more than five hundred\nfactors, each as different from the others as red is different from\ngreen.\n\n\"Continuing farther, particles of the fourth order give rays of the\nfourth order; those of the fifth, rays of the fifth order. Fourth-order\nrays have been investigated quite thoroughly, but only mathematically\nand theoretically, as they are of excessively short wave-length and are\ncapable of being generated only by the breaking down of matter itself\ninto the corresponding particles. However, it has been shown that they\nare quite similar to protelectricity in their general behavior. Thus,\nthe power that propels your space-vessel, your attractors, your\nrepellers, your object-compass, your zone of force--all these things are\nsimply a few of the many hundreds of wave-bands of the fourth order, all\nof which you doubtless would have worked out for yourselves in time.\nVery little is known, even in theory, of the rays of the fifth order,\nalthough they have been shown to exist.\"\n\n\"For a man having no knowledge, you seem to know a lot about rays. How\nabout the fifth order--is that as far as they go?\"\n\n\"My knowledge is slight and very general; only such as I must have in\norder to understand my own subject. The fifth order certainly is not the\nend--it is probably scarcely a beginning. We think now that the orders\nextend to infinite smallness, just as the galaxies are grouped into\nlarger aggregations, which are probably in their turn only tiny units in\na scheme infinitely large.\n\n\"Over six thousand years ago the last third order rays were worked out;\nand certain peculiarities in their behavior led the then Rovol to\nsuspect the existence of the fourth order. Successive generations of the\nRovol proved their existence, determined the conditions of their\nliberation, and found that this metal of power was the only catalyst\nable to decompose matter and thus liberate the rays. This metal, which\nwas called Rovolon after the Rovol, was first described upon theoretical\ngrounds and later was found, by spectroscopy, in certain stars, notably\nin one star only eight light-years away, but not even the most\ninfinitesimal trace of it exists in our entire solar system. Since these\ndiscoveries, the many Rovol have been perfecting the theory of the\nfourth order, beginning that of the fifth, and waiting for your coming.\nThe present Rovol, like myself and many others whose work is almost at a\nstandstill, is waiting with all-consuming interest to greet you, as soon\nas the _Skylark_ can be landed upon our planet.\"\n\n\"Neither your rocket-ships nor your projections could get you any\nRovolon?\"\n\n\"No. Every hundred years or so someone develops a new type of rocket\nthat he thinks may stand a slight chance of making the journey, but not\none of these venturesome youths has as yet returned. Either that sun has\nno planets or else the rocket-ships have failed. Our projections are\nuseless, as they can be driven only a very short distance upon our\npresent carrier wave. With a carrier of the fifth order we could drive a\nprojection to any point in the galaxy, since its velocity would be\nmillions of times that of light and the power necessary reduced\naccordingly--but as I have said before, such waves cannot be generated\nwithout metal Rovolon.\"\n\n\"I hate to break this up--I'd like to listen to you talk for a week--but\nwe're going to land pretty quick, and it looks as though we were going\nto land pretty hard.\"\n\n\"We will land soon, but not hard,\" replied Orlon confidently, and the\nlanding was as he had foretold. The _Skylark_ was falling with an\never-decreasing velocity, but so fast was the descent that it seemed to\nthe watchers as though they must crash through the roof of the huge\nbrilliantly lighted building upon which they were dropping and bury\nthemselves many feet in the ground beneath it. But they did not strike\nthe observatory. So incredibly accurate were the calculations of the\nNorlaminian astronomer and so inhumanly precise were the controls he had\nset upon their bar, that, as they touched the ground after barely\nclearing the domed roof and he shut off their power, the passengers felt\nonly a sudden decrease in acceleration, like that following the coming\nto rest of a rapidly moving elevator, after it has completed a downward\njourney.\n\n\"I shall join you in person very shortly,\" Orlon said, and the\nprojection vanished.\n\n\"Well, we're here, folks, on another new world. Not quite as thrilling\nas the first one was, is it?\" and Seaton stepped toward the door.\n\n\"How about the air composition, density, gravity, temperature, and so\non?\" asked Crane. \"Perhaps we should make a few tests.\"\n\n\"Didn't you get that on the educator? Thought you did. Gravity a little\nless than seven-tenths. Air composition, same as Osnome and Dasor.\nPressure, half-way between Earth and Osnome. Temperature, like Osnome\nmost of the time, but fairly comfortable in the winter. Snow now at the\npoles, but this observatory is only ten degrees from the equator. They\ndon't wear clothes enough to flag a hand-car with here, either, except\nwhen they have to. Let's go!\"\n\nHe opened the door and the four travelers stepped out upon a\nclose-cropped lawn--a turf whose blue-green softness would shame an\nOriental rug. The landscape was illuminated by a soft and mellow, yet\nintense green light which emanated from no visible source. As they\npaused and glanced about them, they saw that the _Skylark_ had alighted\nin the exact center of a circular enclosure a hundred yards in diameter,\nwalled by row upon row of shrubbery, statuary, and fountains, all bathed\nin ever-changing billows of light. At only one point was the circle\nbroken. There the walls did not come together, but continued on to\nborder a lane leading up to the massive structure of cream-and-green\nmarble, topped by its enormous, glassy dome--the observatory of Orlon.\n\n\"Welcome to Norlamin, Terrestrials,\" the deep, calm voice of the\nastronomer greeted them, and Orlon in the flesh shook hands cordially in\nthe American fashion with each of them in turn, and placed around each\nneck a crystal chain from which depended a small Norlaminian\nchronometer-radiophone. Behind him there stood four other old men.\n\n\"These men are already acquainted with each of you, but you do not as\nyet know them. I present Fodan, Chief of the Five of Norlamin. Rovol,\nabout whom you know. Astron, the First of Energy. Satrazon, the First of\nChemistry.\"\n\nOrlon fell in beside Seaton and the party turned toward the observatory.\nAs they walked along the Earth-people stared, held by the unearthly\nbeauty of the grounds. The hedge of shrubbery, from ten to twenty feet\nhigh, and which shut out all sight of everything outside it, was one\nmass of vivid green and flaring crimson leaves; each leaf and twig\ngroomed meticulously into its precise place in a fantastic geometrical\nscheme. Just inside this boundary there stood a ring of statues of\nheroic size. Some of them were single figures of men and women; some\nwere busts; some were groups in natural or allegorical poses--all were\ndone with consummate skill and feeling. Between the statues there were\nfountains, magnificent bronze and glass groups of the strange aquatic\ndenizens of this strange planet, bathed in geometrically shaped sprays,\nscreens, and columns of water. Winding around between the statues and\nthe fountains there was a moving, scintillating wall, and upon the\nwaters and upon the wall there played torrents of color, cataracts of\nharmoniously blended light. Reds, blues, yellows, greens--every color of\ntheir peculiar green spectrum and every conceivable combination of those\ncolors writhed and flamed in ineffable splendor upon those deep and\nliving screens of falling water and upon that shimmering wall.\n\nAs they entered the lane, Seaton saw with amazement that what he had\nsupposed a wall, now close at hand, was not a wall at all. It was\ncomposed of myriads of individual sparkling jewels, of every known\ncolor, for the most part self-luminous; and each gem, apparently\nentirely unsupported, was dashing in and out and along among its\nfellows, weaving and darting here and there, flying at headlong speed\nalong an extremely tortuous, but evidently carefully calculated course.\n\n\"What can that be, anyway, Dick?\" whispered Dorothy, and Seaton turned\nto his guide.\n\n\"Pardon my curiosity, Orlon, but would you mind explaining the why of\nthat moving wall? We don't get it.\"\n\n\"Not at all. This garden has been the private retreat of the family of\nOrlon for many thousands of years, and women of our house have been\nbeautifying it since its inception. You may have observed that the\nstatuary is very old. No such work has been done for ages. Modern art\nhas developed along the lines of color and motion, hence the lighting\neffects and the tapestry wall. Each gem is held upon the end of a minute\npencil of force, and all the pencils are controlled by a machine which\nhas a key for every jewel in the wall.\"\n\nCrane, the methodical, stared at the innumerable flashing jewels and\nasked, \"It must have taken a prodigious amount of time to complete such\nan undertaking?\"\n\n\"It is far from complete; in fact, it is scarcely begun. It was started\nonly about four hundred years ago.\"\n\n\"_Four hundred years!_\" exclaimed Dorothy. \"Do you live that long? How\nlong will it take to finish it, and what will it be like when it is\ndone?\"\n\n\"No, none of us live longer than about one hundred and sixty years--at\nabout that age most of us decide to pass. When this tapestry wall is\nfinished, it will not be simply form and color, as it is now. It will be\na portrayal of the history of Norlamin from the first cooling of the\nplanet. It will, in all probability, require thousands of years for its\ncompletion. You see, time is of little importance to us, and workmanship\nis everything. My companion will continue working upon it until we\ndecide to pass; my son's companion may continue it. In any event, many\ngenerations of the women of the Orlon will work upon it until it is\ncomplete. When it is done, it will be a thing of beauty as long as\nNorlamin shall endure.\"\n\n\"But suppose that your son's wife isn't that kind of an artist? Suppose\nshe should want to do music or painting or something else?\" asked\nDorothy, curiously.\n\n\"That is quite possible; for, fortunately, our art is not yet entirely\nintellectual, as is our music. There are many unfinished artistic\nprojects in the house of Orlon, and if the companion of my son should\nnot find one to her liking, she will be at liberty to continue anything\nelse she may have begun, or to start an entirely new project of her\nown.\"\n\n\"You have a family, then?\" asked Margaret, \"I'm afraid I didn't\nunderstand things very well when you gave them to us over the educator.\"\n\n\"I sent things too fast for you, not knowing that your educator was new\nto you; a thing with which you were not thoroughly familiar. I will\ntherefore explain some things in language, since you are not familiar\nwith the mechanism of thought transference. The Five, a\nself-perpetuating body, do what governing is necessary for the entire\nplanet. Their decrees are founded upon self-evident truth, and are\ntherefore the law. Population is regulated according to the needs of the\nplanet, and since much work is now in progress, an increase in\npopulation was recommended by the Five. My companion and I therefore had\nthree children, instead of the customary two. By lot it fell to us to\nhave two boys and one girl. One of the boys will assume my duties when I\npass; the other will take over a part of some branch of science that has\ngrown too complex for one man to handle as a specialist should. In fact,\nhe has already chosen his specialty and been accepted for it--he is to\nbe the nine hundred and sixty-seventh of Chemistry, the student of the\nasymmetric carbon atom, which will thus be his specialty from this time\nhenceforth.\n\n\"It was learned long ago that the most perfect children were born of\nparents in the full prime of mental life, that is, at one hundred years\nof age. Therefore, with us each generation covers one hundred years. The\nfirst twenty-five years of a child's life are spent at home with his\nparents, during which time he acquires his elementary education in the\ncommon schools. Then boys and girls alike move to the Country of Youth,\nwhere they spend another twenty-five years. There they develop their\nbrains and initiative by conducting any researches they choose. Most of\nus, at that age, solve all the riddles of the Universe, only to discover\nlater that our solutions have been fallacious. However, much really\nexcellent work is done in the Country of Youth, primarily because of the\nnew and unprejudiced viewpoints of the virgin minds there at work. In\nthat country also each finds his life's companion, the one necessary to\nround out mere existence into a perfection of living that no person, man\nor woman, can ever know alone. I need not speak to you of the wonders of\nlove or of the completion and fullness of life that it brings, for all\nfour of you, children though you are, know love in full measure.\n\n\"At fifty years of age the man, now mentally mature, is recalled to his\nfamily home, as his father's brain is now losing some of its vigor and\nkeenness. The father then turns over his work to the son by means of the\neducator--and when the weight of the accumulated knowledge of a hundred\nthousand generations of research is impressed upon the son's brain, his\nplay is over.\"\n\n\"What does the father do then?\"\n\n\"Having made his brain record, about which I have told you, he and his\ncompanion--for she has in similar fashion turned over her work to her\nsuccessor--retire to the Country of Age, where they rest and relax after\ntheir century of effort. They do whatever they care to do, for as long\nas they please to do it. Finally, after assuring themselves that all is\nwell with the children, they decide that they are ready for the Change.\nThen, side by side as they have labored, they pass.\"\n\nNow at the door of the observatory, Dorothy paused and shrank back\nagainst Seaton, her eyes widening as she stared at Orlon.\n\n\"No, daughter, why should we fear the Change?\" he answered her unspoken\nquestion, calm serenity in every inflection of his quiet voice. \"The\nlife-principle is unknowable to the finite mind, as is the\nAll-Controlling Force. But even though we know nothing of the sublime\ngoal toward which it is tending, any person ripe for the Change can, and\nof course does, liberate the life-principle so that its progress may be\nunimpeded.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn a spacious room of the observatory, in which the Terrestrials and\ntheir Norlaminian hosts had been long engaged in study and discussion,\nSeaton finally rose and extended a hand toward his wife.\n\n\"Well, that's that, then, Orlon, I guess. We've been thirty hours\nwithout sleep, and for us that's a long time. I'm getting so dopey I\ncan't think a lick. We'd better go back to the _Skylark_ and turn in,\nand after we've slept nine hours or so I'll go over to Rovol's\nlaboratory and Crane'll come back here to you.\"\n\n\"You need not return to your vessel,\" said Orlon. \"I know that its\nsomewhat cramped quarters have become irksome. Apartments have been\nprepared here for you. We shall have a meal here together, and then we\nshall retire, to meet again tomorrow.\"\n\nAs he spoke, a tray laden with appetizing dishes appeared in the air in\nfront of each person. As Seaton resumed his seat the tray followed him,\nremaining always in the most convenient position.\n\nCrane glanced at Seaton questioningly, and Satrazon, the First of\nChemistry, answered his thought before he could voice it.\n\n\"The food before you, unlike that which is before us of Norlamin, is\nwholesome for you. It contains no copper, no arsenic, no heavy\nmetals--in short, nothing in the least harmful to your chemistry. It is\nbalanced as to carbohydrates, proteins, fats and sugars, and contains\nthe due proportion of each of the various accessory nutritional factors.\nYou will also find the flavors are agreeable to each of you.\"\n\n\"Synthetic, eh? You've got us analyzed,\" Seaton stated, rather than\nasked, as with knife and fork he attacked the thick, rare, and\nbeautifully broiled steak which, with its mushrooms and other delicate\ntrimmings, lay upon his rigid although unsupported tray--noticing as he\ndid so that the Norlaminians ate with tools entirely different from\nthose they had supplied to their Earthly guests.\n\n\"Entirely synthetic,\" Satrazon made answer, \"except for the sodium\nchloride necessary. As you already know, sodium and chlorin are very\nrare throughout our system, therefore the force upon the food-supply\ntook from your vessel the amount of salt required for the formula. We\nhave been unable to synthesize atoms, for the same reason that the\nlabors of so many others have been hindered--because of the lack of\nRovolon. Now, however, my science shall progress as it should; and for\nthat I join with my fellow scientists in giving you thanks for the\nservice you have rendered us.\"\n\n\"We thank you instead,\" replied Seaton, \"for the service we have been\nable to do you is slight indeed compared to what you are giving us in\nreturn. But it seems that you speak quite impersonally of the force upon\nthe food supply. Did you yourself direct the preparation of these meats\nand vegetables?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. I merely analyzed your tissues, surveyed the food-supplies you\ncarried, discovered your individual preferences, and set up the\nnecessary integrals in the mechanism. The forces did the rest, and will\ncontinue to do so as long as you remain upon this planet.\"\n\n\"Fruit salad always my favorite dish,\" Dorothy said, after a couple of\nbites, \"and this one is just too perfectly divine! It doesn't taste like\nany other fruit I ever ate, either--I think it must be the same ambrosia\nthat the old pagan gods used to eat.\"\n\n\"If all you did was to set up the integrals, how do you know what you\nare going to have for the next meal?\" asked Crane.\n\n\"We have no idea what the form, flavor, or consistency of any dish will\nbe,\" was the surprising answer. \"We know only that the flavor will be\nagreeable and that it will agree with the form and consistency of the\nsubstance, and that the composition will be well-balanced chemically.\nYou see, all the details of flavor, form, texture, and so on are\ncontrolled by a device something like one of your kaleidoscopes. The\nintegrals render impossible any unwholesome, unpleasant, or unbalanced\ncombination of any nature, and everything else is left to the mechanism,\nwhich operates upon pure chance.\"\n\n\"Some system, I'd rise to remark,\" and Seaton, with the others, resumed\nhis vigorous attack upon the long-delayed supper.\n\nThe meal over, the Earthly visitors were shown to their rooms, and fell\ninto a deep, dreamless sleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nNorlaminian Science\n\n\nBreakfast over, Seaton watched intently as his tray, laden with empty\ncontainers, floated away from him and disappeared into an opening in the\nwall.\n\n\"How do you do it, Orlon?\" he asked, curiously. \"I can hardly believe\nit, even after seeing it done.\"\n\n\"Each tray is carried upon the end of a beam or rod of force, and\nsupported rigidly by it. Since the beam is tuned to the individual wave\nof the instrument you wear upon your chest, your tray is, of course,\nplaced in front of you, at a predetermined distance, as soon as the\nsending force is actuated. When you have finished your meal, the beam is\nshortened. Thus the tray is drawn back to the food laboratory, where\nother forces cleanse and sterilize the various utensils and place them\nin readiness for the next meal. It would be an easy matter to have this\nsame mechanism place your meals before you wherever you may go upon this\nplanet, provided only that a clear path can be plotted from the\nlaboratory to your person.\"\n\n\"Thanks, but it wouldn't pay. No telling where we'd be. Besides, we'd\nbetter eat in the _Skylark_ most of the time, to keep our cook\ngood-natured. Well, I see Rovol's got his boat here for me, so guess I'd\nbetter turn up a few r. p. m. Coming along, Dot, or have you got\nsomething else on your mind?\"\n\n\"I'm going to leave you for a while. I can't really understand even a\nradio, and just thinking about those funny, complicated rays and things\nyou are going after makes me dizzy in the head. Mrs. Orlon is going to\ntake us over to the Country of Youth--she says Margaret and I can play\naround with her daughter and her bunch and have a good time while you\nscientists are doing your stuff.\"\n\n\"All right. 'Bye till tonight,\" and Seaton stepped out into the grounds,\nwhere the First of Rays was waiting.\n\nThe flier was a torpedo-shaped craft of some transparent, glassy\nmaterial, completely enclosed except for one circular opening or\ndoorway. From the midsection, which was about five feet in diameter and\nprovided with heavily-cushioned seats capable of carrying four\npassengers in comfort, the hull tapered down smoothly to a needle point\nat each end. As Seaton entered and settled himself into the cushions,\nRovol touched a lever. Instantly a transparent door slid across the\nopening, locking itself into position flush with the surface of the\nhull, and the flier darted into the air and away. For a few minutes\nthere was silence, as Seaton studied the terrain beneath them. Fields or\ncities there were none; the land was covered with dense forests and vast\nmeadows, with here and there great buildings surrounded by gracious,\npark-like areas. Rovol finally broke the silence.\n\n\"I understand your problem, I believe, since Orlon has transferred to me\nall the thoughts he had from you. With the aid of the Rovolon you have\nbrought us, I am confident that we shall be able to work out a\nsatisfactory solution of the various problems involved. It will take us\nsome few minutes to traverse the distance to my laboratory, and if there\nare any matters upon which your mind is not quite clear, I shall try to\nclarify them.\"\n\n\"That's letting me down easy,\" Seaton grinned, \"but you don't need to be\nafraid of hurting my feelings--I know just exactly how ignorant and dumb\nI am compared to you. There's a lot of things I don't get at all. First,\nand nearest, this airboat. It has no power-plant at all. I assume that\nit, like so many other things hereabouts, is riding on the end of a rod\nof force?\"\n\n\"Exactly. The beam is generated and maintained in my laboratory. All\nthat is here in the flier is a small sender, for remote control.\"\n\n\"How do you obtain your power?\" asked Seaton. \"Solar generators and tide\nmotors? I know that all your work is done by protelectricity, but Orlon\ndid not inform us as to the sources.\"\n\n\"We have not used such inefficient generators for many thousands of\nyears. Long ago it was shown by research that these rays were constantly\nbeing generated in abundance in outer space, and that they could be\ncollected upon spherical condensers and transmitted without loss to the\nsurface of the planet by means of matched and synchronized crystals.\nSeveral millions of these condensers have been built and thrown out to\nbecome tiny satellites of Norlamin.\"\n\n\"How did you get them far enough out?\"\n\n\"The first ones were forced out to the required distance upon beams of\nforce produced by the conversion of electricity, which was in turn\nproduced from turbines, solar motors, and tide motors. With a few of\nthem out, however, it was easy to obtain sufficient power to send out\nmore; and now, whenever one of us requires more power than he has at his\ndisposal, he merely sends out such additional collectors as he needs.\"\n\n\"Now about those fifth-order rays, which will penetrate a zone of force.\nI am told that they are not ether waves at all?\"\n\n\"They are not ether waves. The fourth order rays, of which the theory\nhas been completely worked out, are the shortest vibrations that can be\npropagated through the ether; for the ether itself is not a continuous\nmedium. We do not know its nature exactly, but it is an actual\nsubstance, and is composed of discrete particles of the fourth order.\nNow the zone of force, which is itself a fourth-order phenomenon, sets\nup a condition of stasis in the particles composing the ether. These\nparticles are relatively so coarse, that rays and particles of the fifth\norder will pass through the fixed zone without retardation. Therefore,\nif there is anything between the particles of the ether--this matter is\nbeing debated hotly among us at the present time--it must be a\nsub-ether, if I may use that term. We have never been able to\ninvestigate any of these things experimentally, not even such a coarse\naggregation as is the ether; but now, having Rovolon, it will not be\nmany thousands of years until we shall have extended our knowledge many\norders farther, in both directions.\"\n\n\"Just how will Rovolon help you?\"\n\n\"It will enable us to generate a force of the ninth magnitude--that much\npower is necessary to set up what you have so aptly named a zone of\nforce--and will give us a source of fourth, fifth, and probably higher\norders of rays which, if they are generated in space at all, are beyond\nour present reach. The zone of force is necessary to shield certain\nitems of equipment from ether vibrations; as any such vibration inside\nthe controlling fields of force renders observation or control of the\nhigher orders of rays impossible.\"\n\n\"Hm ... m, I see--I'm learning something,\" Seaton replied cordially.\n\"Just as the higher-powered a radio set is, the more perfect must be its\nshielding?\"\n\n\"Yes. Just as a trace of any gas will destroy the usefulness of your\nmost sensitive vacuum tubes, and just as imperfect shielding will allow\ninterfering waves to enter sensitive electrical apparatus--in that same\nfashion will even the slightest ether vibration interfere with the\noperation of the extremely sensitive fields and lenses of force which\nmust be used in controlling forces of the higher orders.\"\n\n\"You haven't tested the theory of the fourth order yet, have you?\"\n\n\"No, but that is unnecessary. The theory of the fourth order is not\nreally theory at all--it is mathematical fact. Although we have never\nbeen able to generate them, we know exactly the forces you use in your\nship of space, and we can tell you of some thousands of others more or\nless similar and also highly useful forces which you have not yet\ndiscovered, but are allowing to go to waste. We know exactly what they\nare, how to liberate and control them, and how to use them. In fact, in\nthe work which we are to begin today, we shall use but little ordinary\npower: almost all our work will be done by fourth-order forces,\nliberated from copper by means of the Rovolon you have given me. But\nhere we are at my laboratory. You already know that the best way to\nlearn is by doing, and we shall begin at once.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe flier alighted upon a lawn quite similar to the one before the\nobservatory of Orlon, and the scientist led his Earthly guest through\nthe main entrance of the imposing structure of vari-colored marble and\ngleaming metal and into the vast, glass-lined room that was his\nlaboratory. Great benches lined the walls, and there were hundreds of\ndials, meters, tubes, transformers and other instruments, whose uses\nSeaton could not even guess.\n\nRovol first donned a suit of transparent, flexible material, of a deep\ngolden color, instructing Seaton to do the same; explaining that much of\nthe work would be with dangerous frequencies and with high pressures,\nand that the suits were not only absolute insulators against\nelectricity, heat, and sound, but were also ray-filters proof against\nany harmful radiations. As each helmet was equipped with radiophones,\nconversation was not interfered with in the least.\n\nRovol took up a tiny flash-pencil, and with it deftly cut off a bit of\nRovolon, almost microscopic in size. This he placed upon a great block\nof burnished copper, and upon it played a force. As he manipulated two\nlevers, two more beams of force flattened out the particle of metal,\nspread it out over the copper, and forced it into the surface of the\nblock until the thin coating was at every point in molecular contact\nwith the copper beneath it--a perfect job of plating, and one done in\nthe twinkling of an eye. He then cut out a piece of the treated copper\nthe size of a pea, and other forces rapidly built around it a structure\nof coils and metallic tubes. This apparatus he suspended in the air at\nthe extremity of a small beam of force. The block of copper was next cut\nin two, and Rovol's fingers moved rapidly over the keys of a machine\nwhich resembled slightly an overgrown and exceedingly complicated\nbook-keeping machine. Streams and pencils of force flashed and crackled,\nand Seaton saw raw materials transformed into a complete power-plant, in\nits center the two-hundred-pound lump of plated copper, where an instant\nbefore there had been only empty space upon the massive metal bench.\nRovol's hands moved rapidly from keys to dials and back, and suddenly a\nzone of force, as large as a basketball appeared around the apparatus\npoised in the air.\n\n\"But it'll fly off and we can't stop it with anything,\" Seaton\nprotested, and it did indeed dart rapidly upward.\n\nThe old man shook his head as he manipulated still more controls, and\nSeaton gasped as nine stupendous beams of force hurled themselves upon\nthat brilliant spherical mirror of pure energy, seized it in mid-flight,\nand shaped it resistlessly, under his bulging eyes, into a complex\ngeometrical figure of precisely the desired form.\n\nLurid violet light filled the room, and Seaton turned towards the bar.\nThat two-hundred-pound mass of copper was shrinking visibly, second by\nsecond, so vast were the forces being drawn from it, and the searing,\nblinding light would have been intolerable but for the protective\ncolor-filters of his helmet. Tremendous flashes of lightning ripped and\ntore from the relief-points of the bench to the ground-rods, which\nflared at blue-white temperature under the incessant impacts. Knowing\nthat this corona-loss was but an infinitesimal fraction of the power\nbeing used, Seaton's very mind staggered as he strove to understand the\nmagnitude of the forces at work upon that stubborn sphere of energy.\n\nThe aged scientist used no tools whatever, as we understand the term.\nHis laboratory was a power-house; at his command were the stupendous\nforces of a battery of planetoid accumulators, and added to these were\nthe fourth-order, ninth-magnitude forces of the disintegrating copper\nbar. Electricity, protelectricity, and fourth-order rays, under millions\nupon millions of kilovolts of pressure, leaped to do the bidding of that\nwonderful brain, stored with the accumulated knowledge of countless\nthousands of years of scientific research. Watching the ancient\nphysicist work, Seaton compared himself to a schoolboy mixing chemicals\nindiscriminately and ignorantly, with no knowledge whatever of their\nproperties, occasionally obtaining a reaction by pure chance. Whereas he\nhad worked with intra-atomic energy schoolboy fashion, the master\ncraftsman before him knew every reagent, every reaction, and worked with\nknown and thoroughly familiar agencies to bring about his exactly\npredetermined ends--just as calmly certain of the results as Seaton\nhimself would have been in his own laboratory, mixing equivalent\nquantities of solutions of barium chloride and of sulphuric acid to\nobtain a precipitate of barium sulphate.\n\n[Illustration: _Hour after hour Rovol labored on, oblivious to the\npassage of time in his zeal of accomplishment, the while carefully\ninstructing Seaton, who watched every step with intense interest...._]\n\nHour after hour Rovol labored on, oblivious to the passage of time in\nhis zeal of accomplishment, the while carefully instructing Seaton, who\nwatched every step with intense interest and did everything possible for\nhim to do. Bit by bit a towering structure arose in the middle of the\nlaboratory. A metal foundation supported a massive compound bearing,\nwhich in turn carried a tubular network of latticed metal, mounted like\nan immense telescope. Near the upper, outer end of this openwork tube a\ngroup of nine forces held the field of force rigidly in place in its\naxis; at the lower extremity were mounted seats for two operators and\nthe control panels necessary for the operation of the intricate system\nof forces and motors which would actuate and control that gigantic\nprojector. Immense hour and declination circles could be read by optical\nsystems from the operators' seats--circles fully forty feet in diameter,\ngraduated with incredible delicacy and accuracy into decimal fractions\nof seconds of arc, and each driven by variable-speed motors through\ngear-trains and connections having no backlash whatever.\n\nWhile Rovol was working upon one of the last instruments to be installed\nupon the controlling panel a mellow note sounded throughout the\nbuilding, and he immediately ceased his labors and opened the\nmaster-switches of his power plants.\n\n\"You have done well, youngster,\" he congratulated his helper, as he\nbegan to take off his protective covering, \"Without your aid I could not\nhave accomplished nearly this much during one period of labor. The\nperiods of exercise and of relaxation are at hand--let us return to the\nhouse of Orlon, where we all shall gather to relax and to refresh\nourselves for the labors of tomorrow.\"\n\n\"But it's almost done!\" protested Seaton. \"Let's finish it up and shoot\na little juice through it, just to try it out.\"\n\n\"There speaks the rashness and impatience of youth,\" rejoined the\nscientist, calmly removing the younger man's suit and leading him out to\nthe waiting airboat. \"I read in your mind that you are often guilty of\nlaboring continuously until your brain loses its keen edge. Learn now,\nonce and for all, that such conduct is worse than foolish--it is\ncriminal. We have labored the full period. Laboring for more than that\nlength of time without recuperation results in a loss of power which,\nif persisted in, wreaks permanent injury to the mind; and by it you gain\nnothing. We have more than ample time to do that which must be done--the\nfifth-order projector shall be completed before the warning torpedo\nshall have reached the planet of the Fenachrone--therefore over-exertion\nis unwarranted. As for testing, know now that only mechanisms built by\nbunglers require testing. Properly built machines work properly.\"\n\n\"But I'd have liked to see it work just once, anyway,\" lamented Seaton\nas the small airship tore through the air on its way back to the\nobservatory.\n\n\"You must cultivate calmness, my son, and the art of relaxation. With\nthose qualities your race can easily double its present span of useful\nlife. Physical exercise to maintain the bodily tissues at their best,\nand mental relaxation following mental toil--these things are the\nsecrets of a long and productive life. Why attempt to do more than can\nbe accomplished efficiently? There is always tomorrow. I am more\ninterested in that which we are now building than you can possibly be,\nsince many generations of the Rovol have anticipated its construction;\nyet I realize that in the interest of our welfare and for the progress\nof civilization, today's labors must not be prolonged beyond today's\nperiod of work. Furthermore, you yourself realize that there is no\noptimum point at which any task may be interrupted. Short of final\ncompletion of any project, one point is the same as any other. Had we\ncontinued, we would have wished to continue still farther, and so on\nwithout end.\"\n\n\"You're probably right, at that,\" the impetuous chemist conceded, as\ntheir craft came to earth before the observatory.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCrane and Orlon were already in the common room, as were the scientists\nSeaton already knew, as well as a group of women and children still\nstrangers to the Terrestrials. In a few minutes Orlon's companion, a\ndignified, white-haired woman, entered; accompanied by Dorothy,\nMargaret, and a laughing, boisterous group of men and women from the\nCountry of Youth. Introductions over, Seaton turned to Crane.\n\n\"How's every little thing, Mart?\"\n\n\"Very well indeed. We are building an observatory in space--or rather,\nOrlon is building it and I am doing what little I can to help him. In a\nfew days we shall be able to locate the system of the Fenachrone. How is\nyour work progressing?\"\n\n\"Smoother than a kitten's ear. Got the fourth-order projector about\ndone. We're going to project a fourth-order force out to grab us some\ndense material, a pretty close approach to pure neutronium. There's\nnothing dense enough around here, even in the core of the central sun,\nso we're going out to a white dwarf star--one a good deal like the\ncompanion star to Sirius in Canis Major--get some material of the proper\ndensity from its core, and convert our sender into a fifth-order\nmachine. Then we can really get busy--go places and do things.\"\n\n\"Neutronium? Pure mass?\" queried Crane, \"I have been under the\nimpression that it does not exist. Of what use can such a substance be\nto you?\"\n\n\"Can't get pure neutronium, of course--couldn't use it if we could. What\nwe need and are going to get is a material of about two and a half\nmillion specific gravity. Got to have it for lenses and controls for the\nfifth-order forces. Those rays go right through anything less dense\nwithout measurable refraction. But I see Rovol's giving me a nasty look.\nHe's my boss on this job, and I imagine this kind of talk's barred\nduring the period of relaxation, as being work. That so, chief?\"\n\n\"You know that it is barred, you incorrigible young cub!\" answered\nRovol, with a smile.\n\n\"All right, boss; one more little infraction and I'll shut up like a\nclam. I'd like to know what the girls have been doing.\"\n\n\"We've been having a wonderful time!\" Dorothy declared. \"We've been\ndesigning fabrics and ornaments and jewels and things. Wait 'til you see\n'em!\"\n\n\"Fine! All right, Orlon, it's your party--what to do?\"\n\n\"This is the time of exercise. We have many forms, most of which are\nunfamiliar to you. You all swim, however, and as that is one of the best\nof exercises, I suggest that we all swim.\"\n\n\"Lead us to it!\" Seaton exclaimed, then his voice changed abruptly.\n\"Wait a minute--I don't know about our swimming in copper sulphate\nsolution.\"\n\n\"We swim in fresh water as often as in salt, and the pool is now filled\nwith distilled water.\"\n\nThe Terrestrials quickly donned their bathing suits and all went through\nthe observatory and down a winding path, bordered with the peculiarly\nbeautiful scarlet and green shrubbery, to the \"pool\"--an artificial lake\ncovering a hundred acres, its polished metal bottom and sides strikingly\ndecorated with jewels and glittering tiles in tasteful yet contrasting\ninlaid designs. Any desired depth of water was available and plainly\nmarked, from the fenced-off shallows where the smallest children\nsplashed to the forty feet of liquid crystal which received the diver\nwho cared to try his skill from one of the many spring-boards, flying\nrings, and catapults which rose high into the air a short distance away\nfrom the entrance.\n\nOrlon and the others of the older generation plunged into the water\nwithout ado and struck out for the other shore, using a fast\ndouble-overarm stroke. Swimming in a wide circle they came out upon the\napparatus and went through a series of methodical dives and gymnastic\nperformances. It was evident that they swam, as Orlon had intimated, for\nexercise. To them, exercise was a necessary form of labor--labor which\nthey performed thoroughly and well--but nothing to call forth the\nwhole-souled enthusiasm they displayed in their chosen fields of mental\neffort.\n\nThe visitors from the Country of Youth, however, locked arms and sprang\nto surround the four Terrestrials, crying, \"Let's do a group dive!\"\n\n\"I don't believe that I can swim well enough to enjoy what's coming,\"\nwhispered Margaret to Crane, and they slipped into the pool and turned\naround to watch. Seaton and Dorothy, both strong swimmers, locked arms\nand laughed as they were encircled by the green phalanx and swept out to\nthe end of a dock-like structure and upon a catapult.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Hold tight, everybody!\" someone yelled, and interlaced, straining arms\nand legs held the green and white bodies in one motionless group as a\ngigantic force hurled them fifty feet into the air and out over the\ndeepest part of the pool. There was a mighty splash and a miniature\ntidal wave as that mass of humanity struck the water. Many feet they\nwent down before the cordon was broken and the individual units came to\nthe surface. Then pandemonium reigned. Vigorous informal games, having\nto do with floating and sinking balls and effigies: pushball, in which\nthe players never seemed to know, or to care, upon which side they were\nplaying; water-fights and ducking contests.... A green mermaid, having\nfelt the incredible power of Seaton's arms as he tossed her lightly away\nfrom a goal he was temporarily defending, put both her small hands\naround his biceps wonderingly, amazed at a strength unknown and\nimpossible upon her world; then playfully tried to push him under.\nFailing, she called for help.\n\n\"He's needed a good ducking for ages!\" Dorothy cried, and she and\nseveral other girls threw themselves upon him. Over and around him the\nlithe forms flashed, while the rest of the young people splashed water\nimpartially over all the combatants and cheered them on. In the midst of\nthe battle the signal sounded to end the period of exercise.\n\n\"Saved by the bell,\" Seaton laughed as, thoroughly ducked and almost\nhalf drowned, he was allowed to swim ashore.\n\nWhen all had returned to the common room of the observatory and had\nseated themselves, Orlon took out his miniature ray-projector, no larger\nthan a fountain pen, and flashed it briefly upon one of the hundreds of\nbutton-like lenses upon the wall. Instantly each chair converted itself\ninto a form-fitting divan, inviting complete repose.\n\n\"I believe that you of Earth would perhaps enjoy some of our music\nduring this, the period of relaxation and repose--it is so different\nfrom your own,\" Orlon remarked, as he again manipulated his tiny\nforce-tube.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEvery light was extinguished and there was felt a profoundly deep\nvibration--a note so low as to be palpable rather than audible; and\nsimultaneously the utter darkness was relieved by a tinge of red so dark\nas to be barely perceptible, while a peculiar somber fragrance pervaded\nthe atmosphere. The music rapidly ran the gamut to the limit of\naudibility and, in the same tempo, the lights traversed the visible\nspectrum and disappeared. Then came a crashing chord and a vivid flare\nof blended light; ushering in an indescribable symphony of sound and\ncolor, accompanied by a slower succession of shifting, blending odors.\n\nThe quality of tone was now that of a gigantic orchestra, now that of a\nfull brass band, now that of a single unknown instrument--as though the\ncomposer had had at his command every overtone capable of being produced\nby any possible instrument, and with them had woven a veritable tapestry\nof melody upon an incredibly complex loom of sound. As went the harmony,\nso the play of light accompanied it. Neither music nor illumination came\nfrom any apparent source; they simply pervaded the entire room. When the\nmusic was fast--and certain passages were of a rapidity impossible for\nany human fingers to attain--the lights flashed in vivid, tiny pencils,\nintersecting each other in sharply drawn, brilliant figures, which\nchanged with dizzying speed; when the tempo was slow, the beams were\nsoft and broad, blending into each other to form sinuous, indefinite,\nwrithing patterns, whose very vagueness was infinitely soothing.\n\n\"What do you think of it, Mrs. Seaton?\" Orlon asked.\n\n\"Marvelous!\" breathed Dorothy, awed. \"I never imagined anything like it.\nI can't begin to tell you how much I like it. I never dreamed of such\nabsolute perfection of execution, and the way the lighting accompanies\nthe theme is just too perfectly wonderful for words! It was incredibly\nbrilliant.\"\n\n\"Brilliant--yes. Perfectly executed--yes. But I notice that you say\nnothing of depth of feeling or of emotional appeal.\" Dorothy blushed\nuncomfortably and started to say something, but Orlon silenced her and\ncontinued: \"You need not apologize. I had a reason for speaking as I\ndid, for in you I recognize a real musician, and our music is indeed\nentirely soulless. That is the result of our ancient civilization. We\nare so old that our music is purely intellectual, entirely mechanical,\ninstead of emotional. It is perfect, but, like most of our other arts,\nit is almost completely without feeling.\"\n\n\"But your statues are wonderful!\"\n\n\"As I told you, those statues were made myriads of years ago. At that\ntime we also had real music, but, unlike statuary, music at that time\ncould not be preserved for posterity. That is another thing you have\ngiven us. Attend!\"\n\nAt one end of the room, as upon a three-dimensional screen, the four\nTerrestrials saw themselves seated in the control-room of the _Skylark_.\nThey saw and heard Margaret take up her guitar, and strike four sonorous\nchords in \"A.\" Then, as if they had been there in person, they heard\nthemselves sing \"The Bull-Frog\" and all the other songs they had sung,\nfar off in space. They heard Margaret suggest that Dorothy play some\n\"real music,\" and heard Seaton's comments upon the quartette.\n\n\"In that, youngster, you were entirely wrong,\" said Orlon, stopping the\nreproduction for a moment. \"The entire planet was listening to you very\nattentively--we were enjoying it as no music has been enjoyed for\nthousands of years.\"\n\n\"The whole planet!\" gasped Margaret. \"Were you broadcasting it? How\ncould you?\"\n\n\"Easy,\" grinned Seaton. \"They can do most anything with these rays of\ntheirs.\"\n\n\"When you have time, in some period of labor, we would appreciate it\nvery much if you four would sing for us again, would give us more of\nyour vast store of youthful music, for we can now preserve it exactly as\nit is sung. But much as we enjoyed the quartette, Mrs. Seaton, it was\nyour work upon the violin that took us by storm. Beginning with\ntomorrow, my companion intends to have you spend as many periods as you\nwill, playing for our records. We shall now have your music.\"\n\n\"If you like it so well, wouldn't you rather I'd play you something I\nhadn't played before?\"\n\n\"That is labor. We could not....\"\n\n\"Piffle!\" Dorothy interrupted. \"Don't you see that I could really play\nright now, with somebody to listen, who really enjoys music; whereas, if\nI tried to play in front of a record, I'd be perfectly mechanical?\"\n\n\"'At-a-girl, Dot! I'll get your fiddle.\"\n\n\"Keep your seat, son,\" instructed Orlon, as the case containing the\nStradivarius appeared before Dorothy, borne by a pencil of force. \"While\nthat temperament is incomprehensible to every one of us, it is\nundoubtedly true that the artistic mind does work in that manner. We\nlisten.\"\n\nDorothy swept into \"The Melody in F,\" and as the poignantly beautiful\nstrains poured forth from that wonderful violin, she knew that she had\nher audience with her. Though so intellectual that they themselves were\nincapable of producing music of real depth of feeling, they could\nunderstand and could enjoy such music with an appreciation impossible to\na people of lesser mental attainments; and their profound enjoyment of\nher playing, burned into her mind by the telepathic, almost hypnotic\npower of the Norlaminian mentality, raised her to heights of power she\nhad never before attained. Playing as one inspired, she went through one\ntremendous solo after another--holding her listeners spellbound, urged\non by their intense feeling to carry them further and ever further into\nthe realm of pure emotional harmony. The bell which ordinarily signaled\nthe end of the period of relaxation did not sound; for the first time in\nthousands of years the planet of Norlamin deserted its rigid schedule of\nlife--to listen to one Earth-woman, pouring out her very soul upon her\nincomparable violin.\n\nThe final note of \"Memories\" died away in a diminuendo wail, and the\nmusician almost collapsed into Seaton's arms. The profound silence, more\nimpressive far than any possible applause, was soon broken by Dorothy.\n\n\"There--I'm all right now, Dick. I was about out of control for a\nminute. I wish they could have had that on a recorder--I'll never be\nable to play like that again if I live to be a thousand years old.\"\n\n\"It is on record, daughter. Every note and every inflection is\npreserved, precisely as you played it,\" Orlon assured her. \"That is our\nonly excuse for allowing you to continue as you did, almost to the point\nof exhaustion. While we cannot really understand an artistic mind of the\npeculiar type to which yours belongs, yet we realized that each time you\nplay you are doing something that no one, not even yourself, can ever do\nagain in precisely the same subtle fashion. Therefore we allowed, in\nfact encouraged, you to go on as long as that creative impulse should\nendure--not merely for our pleasure in hearing it, great though that\npleasure was, but in the hope that our workers in music could, by a\ncareful analysis of your product, determine quantitatively the exact\nvibrations or overtones which make the difference between emotional and\nintellectual music.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nInto a Sun\n\n\nAs Rovol and Seaton approached the physics laboratory at the beginning\nof the period of labor, another small airboat occupied by one man drew\nup beside them and followed them to the ground. The stranger, another\nwhite-bearded ancient, greeted Rovol cordially and was introduced to\nSeaton as \"Caslor, the First of Mechanism.\"\n\n\"Truly, this is a high point in the course of Norlaminian science, my\nyoung friend,\" Caslor acknowledged the introduction smilingly. \"You have\nenabled us to put into practice many things which our ancestors studied\nin theory for many a wearisome cycle of time.\" Turning to Rovol, he went\non: \"I understand that you require a particularly precise directional\nmechanism? I know well that it must indeed be one of exceeding precision\nand delicacy, for the controls you yourself have built are able to hold\nupon any point, however moving, within the limits of our immediate solar\nsystem.\"\n\n\"We require controls a million times as delicate as any I have\nconstructed,\" said Rovol, \"therefore I have called your surpassing skill\ninto co-operation. It is senseless for me to attempt a task in which I\nwould be doomed to failure. We intend to send out a fifth-order\nprojection, something none of our ancestors ever even dreamed of, which,\nwith its inconceivable velocity of propagation, will enable us to\nexplore any region in the galaxy as quickly as we now visit our closest\nsister planet. Knowing the dimensions of this, our galaxy, you can\nreadily understand the exact degree of precision required to hold upon a\npoint at its outermost edge.\"\n\n\"Truly, a problem worthy of any man's brain,\" Caslor replied after a\nmoment's thought. \"Those small circles,\" pointing to the forty-foot hour\nand declination circles which Seaton had thought the ultimate in precise\nmeasurement of angular magnitudes, \"are of course useless. I shall have\nto construct large and accurate circles, and in order to produce the\nslow and fast motions of the required nature, without creep, slip, play,\nor backlash, I shall require a pure torque, capable of being increased\nby infinitesimal increments.... Pure torque.\"\n\nHe thought deeply for a time, then went on: \"No gear-train or chain\nmechanism can be built of sufficient tightness, since in any mechanism\nthere is some freedom of motion, however slight, and for this purpose\nthe director must have no freedom of motion whatever. We must have a\npure torque--and the only possible force answering our requirements is\nthe four hundred sixty-seventh band of the fourth order. I shall\ntherefore be compelled to develop that band. The director must, of\ncourse, have a full equatorial mounting, with circles some two hundred\nand fifty feet in diameter. Must your projector tube be longer than\nthat, for correct design?\"\n\n\"That length will be ample.\"\n\n\"The mounting must be capable of rotation through the full circle of arc\nin either plane, and must be driven in precisely the motion required to\nneutralize the motion of our planet, which, as you know, is somewhat\nirregular. Additional fast and slow motions must, of course, be provided\nto rotate the mechanism upon each graduated circle at the will of the\noperator. It is my idea to make the outer supporting tube quite large,\nso that you will have full freedom with your inner, or projector tube\nproper. It seems to me that dimensions X37 B42 J867 would perhaps be as\ngood as any.\"\n\n\"Perfectly satisfactory. You have the apparatus well in mind.\"\n\n\"These things will consume some time. How soon will you require this\nmechanism?\" asked Caslor.\n\n\"We also have much to do. Two periods of labor, let us say: or, if you\nrequire them, three.\"\n\n\"It is well. Two periods will be ample time: I was afraid that you might\nneed it today, and the work cannot be accomplished in one period of\nlabor. The mounting will, of course, be prepared in the Area of\nExperiment. Farewell.\"\n\n\"You aren't going to build the final projector here, then?\" Seaton asked\nas Caslor's flier disappeared.\n\n\"We shall build it here, then transport it to the Area, where its\ndirigible housing will be ready to receive it. All mechanisms of that\ntype are set up there. Not only is the location convenient to all\ninterested, but there are to be found all necessary tools, equipment and\nmaterial. Also, and not least important for such long-range work as we\ncontemplate, the entire Area of Experiment is anchored immovably to the\nsolid crust of the planet, so that there can be not even the slightest\nvibration to affect the direction of our beams of force, which must, of\ncourse, be very long.\"\n\nHe closed the master switches of his power-plants and the two resumed\nwork where they had left off. The control panel was soon finished. Rovol\nthen plated an immense cylinder of copper and placed it in the\npower-plant. He next set up an entirely new system of refractory\nrelief-points and installed additional ground-rods, sealed through the\nfloor and extending deep into the ground below, explaining as he worked.\n\n\"You see, son, we must lose one one-thousandth of one per cent of our\ntotal energy, and provision must be made for its dissipation in order to\navoid destruction of the laboratory. These air-gap resistances are the\nsimplest means of disposing of the wasted power.\"\n\n\"I get you--but say, how about disposing of it when we get the thing in\na ship out in space? We picked up pretty heavy charges in the\n_Skylark_--so heavy that I had to hold up several times in the ionized\nlayer of an atmosphere while they faded--and this outfit will burn up\ntons of copper where the old ones used ounces.\"\n\n\"In the projected space-vessel we shall install converters to utilize\nall the energy, so that there will be no loss whatever. Since such\nconverters must be designed and built especially for each installation,\nand since they require a high degree of precision, it is not worth while\nto construct them for a purely temporary mechanism, such as this one.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe walls of the laboratory were opened, ventilating blowers were built,\nand refrigerating coils were set up everywhere, even in the tubular\nstructure and behind the visiplates. After assuring themselves that\neverything combustible had been removed, the two scientists put on under\ntheir helmets, goggles whose protecting lenses could be built up to any\ndesired thickness. Rovol then threw a switch, and a hemisphere of\nflaming golden radiance surrounded the laboratory and extended for miles\nupon all sides.\n\n\"I get most of the stuff you've pulled so far, but why such a light?\"\nasked Seaton.\n\n\"As a warning. This entire area will be filled with dangerous\nfrequencies, and that light is a warning for all uninsulated persons to\ngive our theater of operations a wide berth.\"\n\n\"I see. What next?\"\n\n\"All that remains to be done is to take our lens-material and go,\"\nreplied Rovol, as he took from a cupboard the largest faidon that Seaton\nhad ever seen.\n\n\"Oh, that's what you're going to use! You know, I've been wondering\nabout that stuff. I took one back with me to the Earth to experiment on.\nI gave it everything I could think of and couldn't touch it. I couldn't\neven make it change its temperature. What is it, anyway?\"\n\n\"It is not matter at all, in the ordinary sense of the word. It is\nalmost pure crystallized energy. You have, of course, noticed that it\nlooks transparent, but that it is not. You cannot see into its substance\na millionth of a micron--the illusion of transparency being purely a\nsurface phenomenon, and peculiar to this one form of substance. I have\ntold you that the ether is a fourth-order substance--this also is a\nfourth-order substance, but it is crystalline, whereas the ether is\nprobably fluid and amorphous. You might call this faidon crystallized\nether without being far wrong.\"\n\n\"But it should weigh tons, and it is hardly heavier than air--or no,\nwait a minute. Gravitation is also a fourth-order phenomenon, so it\nmight not weigh anything at all--but it would have terrific mass--or\nwould it, not having protons? Crystallized ether would displace fluid\nether, so it might--I'll give up! It's too deep for me!\" said Seaton.\n\n\"Its theory is abstruse, and I cannot explain it to you any more fully\nthan I have, until after we have given you a knowledge of the fourth and\nfifth orders. Pure fourth-order material would be without weight and\nwithout mass; but these crystals as they are found are not absolutely\npure. In crystallizing from the magma, they entrapped sufficient numbers\nof particles of the higher orders to give them the characteristics which\nyou have observed. The impurities, however, are not sufficient in\nquantity to offer a point of attack to any ordinary reagent.\"\n\n\"But how could such material possibly be formed?\"\n\n\"It could be formed only in some such gigantic cosmic body as this, our\ngreen system, formed incalculable ages ago, when all the mass comprising\nit existed as one colossal sun. Picture for yourself the condition in\nthe center of that sun. It has attained the theoretical maximum of\ntemperature--some seventy million of your centigrade degrees--the\nelectrons have been stripped from the protons until the entire central\ncore is one solid ball of neutronium and can be compressed no more\nwithout destruction of the protons themselves. Still the pressure\nincreases. The temperature, already at the theoretical maximum, can no\nlonger increase. What happens?\"\n\n\"Disruption.\"\n\n\"Precisely. And just at the instant of disruption, during the very\ninstant of generation of the frightful forces that are to hurl suns,\nplanets and satellites millions of miles out into space--in that instant\nof time, as a result of those unimaginable temperatures and pressures,\nthe faidon comes into being. It can be formed only by the absolute\nmaximum of temperature and at a pressure which can exist only\nmomentarily, even in the largest conceivable masses.\"\n\n\"Then how can you make a lens of it? It must be impossible to work it in\nany way.\"\n\n\"It cannot be worked in any ordinary way, but we shall take this crystal\ninto the depths of that white dwarf star, into a region in which obtain\npressures and temperatures only less than those giving it birth. There\nwe shall play forces upon it which, under those conditions, will be able\nto work it quite readily.\"\n\n\"Hm--m--m. I want to see that! Let's go!\"\n\nThey seated themselves at the panels, and Rovol began to manipulate\nkeys, levers and dials. Instantly a complex structure of visible\nforce--rods, beams and flat areas of flaming scarlet energy--appeared at\nthe end of the tubular, telescope-like network.\n\n\"Why red?\"\n\n\"Merely to render them visible. One cannot work well with invisible\ntools, hence I have imposed a colored light frequency upon the invisible\nfrequencies of the forces. We will have an assortment of colors if you\nprefer,\" and as he spoke each ray assumed a different color, so that the\nend of the projector was almost lost beneath a riot of color.\n\nThe structure of force, which Seaton knew was the secondary projector,\nswung around as if sentient, and a lurid green ray extended itself,\npicked up the faidon, and lengthened out, hurling the jewel a thousand\nyards out through the open side of the laboratory. Rovol moved more\ncontrols and the structure again righted itself, swinging back into\nperfect alignment with the tube and carrying the faidon upon its\nextremity, a thousand yards beyond the roof of the laboratory.\n\n\"We are now ready to start our projection. Be sure your suit and goggles\nare perfectly tight. We must see what we are doing, so the light-rays\nmust be heterodyned upon our carrier wave. Therefore the laboratory and\nall its neighborhood will be flooded with dangerous frequencies from the\nsun we are to visit, as well as with those from our own generators.\"\n\n\"O. K., chief! All tight here. You say it's ten light-years to that\nstar. How long's it going to take us to get there?\"\n\n\"About ten minutes. We could travel that far in less than ten seconds\nbut for the fact that we must take the faidon with us. Slight as is its\nmass, it will require much energy in its acceleration. Our projections,\nof course, have no mass, and will require only the energy of\npropagation.\"\n\n[Illustration: _Looking into the visiplate, he was out in space in\nperson, hurtling through space at a pace, beside which the best effort\nof the Skylark seemed the veriest crawl._]\n\nRovol flicked a finger, a massive pair of plunger switches shot into\ntheir sockets, and Seaton, seated at his board and staring into his\nvisiplate, was astounded to find that he apparently possessed a dual\npersonality. He _knew_ that he was seated motionless in the operator's\nchair in the base of the rigidly anchored primary projector, and by\ntaking his eyes away from the visiplate before him, he could see that\nnothing in the laboratory had changed, except that the pyrotechnic\ndisplay from the power-bar was of unusual intensity. Yet, looking into\nthe visiplate, he was out in space _in person_, hurtling through space\nat a pace beside which the best effort of the _Skylark_ seemed the\nveriest crawl. Swinging his controls to look backward, he gasped as he\nsaw, so stupendous was their velocity, that the green system was only\nbarely discernible as a faint green star!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAgain looking forward, it seemed as though a fierce white star had\nseparated from the immovable firmament and was now so close to the\nstructure of force in which he was riding that it was already showing a\ndisk perceptible to the unaided eye. A few moments more and the\nviolet-white splendor became so intense that the watchers began to build\nup, layer by layer, the protective goggles before their eyes. As they\napproached still closer, falling with their unthinkable velocity into\nthat incandescent inferno, a sight was revealed to their eyes such as\nman had never before been privileged to gaze upon. They were falling\ninto a white dwarf star, could see everything visible during such an\nunheard-of journey, and would live to remember what they had seen! They\nsaw the magnificent spectacle of solar prominences shooting hundreds of\nthousands of miles into space, and directly in their path they saw an\nimmense sunspot, a combined volcanic eruption and cyclonic storm in a\ngaseous-liquid medium of blinding incandescence.\n\n\"Better dodge that spot, hadn't we, ace? Mightn't it be generating\ninterfering fourth-order frequencies?\" cried Seaton.\n\n\"It is undoubtedly generating fourth-order rays, but nothing can\ninterfere with us, since we are controlling every component of our beam\nfrom Norlamin.\"\n\nSeaton gripped his hand-rail violently and involuntarily drew himself\ntogether into the smallest possible compass as, with their awful speed\nunchecked, they plunged through that flaming, incandescent photosphere\nand on, straight down, into the unexplored, unimaginable interior of\nthat frightful and searing orb. Through the protecting goggles, now a\nfull four inches of that peculiar, golden, shielding metal, Seaton could\nsee the structure of force in which he was, and could also see the\nfaidon--in outline, as transparent diamonds are visible in equally\ntransparent water. Their apparent motion slowed rapidly and the material\nabout them thickened and became more and more opaque. The faidon drew\nback toward them until it was actually touching the projector, and eddy\ncurrents and striae became visible in the mass about them as their\nprogress grew slower and slower.\n\n\"'Smatter? Something gone screwy?\" demanded Seaton.\n\n\"Not at all, everything is working perfectly. The substance is now so\ndense that it is becoming opaque to rays of the fourth order, so that we\nare now partially displacing the medium instead of moving through it\nwithout friction. At the point where we can barely see to work; that is,\nwhen the fourth-order rays will be so retarded that they can no longer\ncarry the heterodyned light waves without complete distortion, we shall\nstop automatically, as the material at that depth will have the required\ndensity to refract the fifth-order rays to the correct degree.\"\n\n\"How can our foundations stand it?\" asked Seaton. \"This stuff must be a\nhundred times as dense as platinum already, and we must he pushing a\nhorrible load in going through it.\"\n\n\"We are exerting no force whatever upon our foundations nor upon\nNorlamin. The force is transmitted without loss from the power-plant in\nour laboratory to this secondary projector here inside the star, where\nit is liberated in the correct band to pull us through the mass, using\nall the mass ahead of us as anchorage. When we wish to return, we shall\nsimply change the pull into a push. Ah! we are now at a standstill--now\ncomes the most important moment of the entire project!\"\n\nAll apparent motion had ceased, and Seaton could see only dimly the\noutlines of the faidon, now directly before his eyes. The structure of\nforce slowly warped around until its front portion held the faidon as in\na vise. Rovol pressed a lever and behind them, in the laboratory, four\nenormous plunger switches drove home. A plane of pure energy, flaming\nradiantly even in the indescribable incandescence of the core of that\nseething star, bisected the faidon neatly, and ten gigantic beams, five\nupon each half of the jewel, rapidly molded two sections of a\ngeometrically-perfect hollow lens. The two sections were then brought\ntogether by the closing of the jaws of the mighty vise, their edges in\nexact alignment. Instantly the plane and the beams of energy became\ntransformed into two terrific opposing tubes of force--vibrant, glowing\ntubes, whose edges in contact coincided with the almost invisible seam\nbetween the two halves of the lens.\n\nLike a welding arc raised to the _nth_ power these two immeasurable and\nirresistible forces met exactly in opposition--a meeting of such\nincredible violence that seismic disturbances occurred throughout the\nentire mass of that dense, violet-white star. Sunspots of unprecedented\nsize appeared, prominences erupted to hundreds of times their normal\ndistances, and although the two scientists deep in the core of the\ntormented star were unaware of what was happening upon its surface,\nconvulsion after Titanic convulsion wracked the mighty globe, and\nenormous masses of molten and gaseous material were riven from it and\nhurled far out into space--masses which would in time become planets of\nthat youthful and turbulent luminary.\n\nSeaton felt his air-supply grow hot. Suddenly it became icy cold, and\nknowing that Rovol had energized the refrigerator system, Seaton turned\naway from the fascinating welding operation for a quick look around the\nlaboratory. As he did so, he realized Rovol's vast knowledge and\nunderstood the reason for the new system of relief-points and\nground-rods, as well as the necessity for the all-embracing scheme of\nrefrigeration.\n\nEven through the practically opaque goggles he could see that the\nlaboratory was one mass of genuine lightning. Not only from the\nrelief-points, but from every metallic corner and protuberance the\npent-up losses from the disintegrating bar were hurling themselves upon\nthe flaring, blue-white, rapidly-volatilizing ground-rods; and the very\nair of the room, renewed second by second though it was by the powerful\nblowers, was beginning to take on the pearly luster of the\nhighly-ionized corona. The bar was plainly visible, a scintillating\ndemon of pure violet radiance, and a momentary spasm of fear seized him\nas he saw how rapidly that great mass of copper was shrinking--fear that\ntheir power would be exhausted with their task still uncompleted.\n\nBut the calculations of the aged physicist had been accurate. The lens\nwas completed with some hundreds of pounds of copper to spare, and that\ngeometrical form, with its precious content of semi-neutronium, was\nfollowing the secondary projector back toward the green system. Rovol\nleft his seat, discarded his armor, and signaled Seaton to do the same.\n\n\"I've got to hand it to you, ace--you sure are a blinding flash and a\ndeafening report!\" Seaton exclaimed, writhing out of his insulating\nsuit. \"I feel as though I'd been pulled half-way through a knot-hole and\nriveted over on both ends! How big a lens did you make, anyway? Looked\nas though it would hold a couple of liters; maybe three.\"\n\n\"Its contents are almost exactly three liters.\"\n\n\"Hm--m--m. Seven and a half million kilograms--say eight thousand tons.\n_Some_ mass, I'd say, to put into a gallon jug. Of course, being inside\nthe faidon, it won't have any weight, but it'll have all its full quota\nof inertia. That's why you're taking so long to bring it in, of course.\"\n\n\"Yes. The projector will now bring it here into the laboratory without\nany further attention from us. The period of labor is about to end, and\ntomorrow we shall find the lens awaiting us when we arrive to begin\nwork.\"\n\n\"How about cooling it off? It had a temperature of something like forty\nmillion degree centigrade before you started working on it; and when you\ngot done with it, it was hot.\"\n\n\"You're forgetting again, son. Remember that the hot, dense material is\nentirely enclosed in an envelope impervious to all vibrations longer\nthan those of the fifth order. You could put your hand upon it now,\nwithout receiving any sensation either of heat, or of cold.\"\n\n\"Yeah, that's right, too. I noticed that I could take a faidon right out\nof an electric arc and it wouldn't even be warm. I couldn't explain why\nit was, but I see now. So that stuff inside that lens will always stay\nas hot as it is right now! Zowie! Here's hoping she never explodes!\nWell, there's the bell--for once in my life, I'm all ready to quit when\nthe whistle blows,\" and arm in arm the young Terrestrial chemist and the\naged Norlaminian physicist strolled out to their waiting airboat.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nFlying Visits--Via Projection\n\n\n\"Well, what to do?\" asked Seaton as he and Rovol entered the laboratory,\n\"Tear down this fourth-order projector and tackle the big job? I see the\nlens is here, on schedule, so we can hop right into it.\"\n\n\"We shall have further use for this mechanism. We shall need at least\none more lens of this dense material, and other scientists also may have\nneed of one or two. Then, too, the new projector must be so large that\nit cannot be erected in this room.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Rovol seated himself at his control-desk and ran his\nfingers lightly over the keys. The entire wall of the laboratory\ndisappeared, hundreds of beams of force darted here and there, seizing\nand working raw materials, and in the portal there grew up, to Seaton's\namazement, a keyboard and panel installation such as the Earth-man, in\nhis wildest moments, had never imagined. Bank upon bank of\ntypewriter-like keys; row upon row of keys, pedals, and stops resembling\nsomewhat those of the console of a gigantic pipe-organ; panel upon panel\nof meters, switches, and dials--all arranged about two deeply-cushioned\nchairs and within reach of their occupants.\n\n\"Whew! That looks like the combined mince-pie nightmares of a whole\nflock of linotype operators, pipe-organists, and hard-boiled radio\nhams!\" exclaimed Seaton when the installation was complete. \"Now that\nyou've got it, what are you going to do with it?\"\n\n\"There is not a control system in Norlamin adequate for the task we\nface, since the problem of the projection of rays of the fifth order has\nheretofore been of only academic interest. Therefore it becomes\nnecessary to construct such a control. This mechanism will, I am\nconfident, have a sufficiently wide range of application to perform any\noperation we shall require of it.\"\n\n\"It sure looks as though it could do almost anything, provided the man\nbehind it knows how to play a tune on it--but if that rumble seat is for\nme, you'd better count me out right now. I followed you for about\nfifteen seconds, then lost you completely; and now I'm sunk without a\ntrace,\" said Seaton.\n\n\"That is, of course, true, and is a point I was careless enough to\noverlook.\" Rovol thought for a moment, then got up, crossed the room to\nhis control desk, and continued, \"We shall dismantle the machine and\nrebuild it at once.\"\n\n\"Oh no--too much work!\" protested Seaton, \"You've got it about done,\nhaven't you?\"\n\n\"It is hardly started. Two hundred thousand bands of force must be\nlinked to it, each in its proper place, and it is necessary that you\nshould understand thoroughly every detail of this entire projector,\"\nRovol answered.\n\n\"Why? I'm not ashamed to admit that I haven't got brains enough to\nunderstand a thing like that.\"\n\n\"You have sufficient brain capacity; it is merely undeveloped. There are\ntwo reasons why you must be as familiar with the operation of this\nmechanism as you are with the operation of one of your Earthly\nautomobiles. The first is that a similar control is to be installed in\nyour new space-vessel, since by its use you can attain a perfection of\nhandling impossible by any other system. The second, and more important\nreason, is that neither I nor any other man of Norlamin could compel\nhimself, by any force of will, to direct a ray that would take away the\nlife of any fellow-man.\"\n\nWhile Rovol was speaking, he reversed his rays, and soon the component\nparts of the new control had been disassembled and piled in orderly\narray about the room.\n\n\"Hm--m--m. Never thought of that. It's right too,\" mused Seaton. \"How're\nyou going to get it into my thick skull--with an educator?\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" and Rovol sent a beam of force after his highly developed\neducational mechanism. Dials and electrodes were adjusted, connections\nwere established, and the beams and pencils of force began to\nreconstruct the great central controlling device. But this time, instead\nof being merely a bewildered spectator, Seaton was an active participant\nin the work. As each key and meter was wrought and mounted, there were\nindelibly impressed upon his brain the exact reason for and function of\nthe part, and later, when the control itself was finished and the\nseemingly interminable task of connecting it up to the output\nforce-bands of the transformers had begun, he had a complete\nunderstanding of everything with which he was working, and understood\nall the means by which the ends he had so long desired were to be\nattained. For to the ancient scientist the tasks he was then performing\nwere the merest routine, to be performed in reflex fashion, and he\ndevoted most of his attention to transferring from his own brain to that\nof his young assistant as much of his stupendous knowledge as the\nsmaller brain of the Terrestrial was capable of absorbing. More and more\nrapidly as the work progressed the mighty flood of knowledge poured into\nSeaton's mind. After an hour or so, when enough connections had been\nmade so that automatic forces could be so directed as to finish the job,\nRovol and Seaton left the laboratory and went into the living room. As\nthey walked, the educator accompanied them, borne upon its beam of\nforce.\n\n\"Your brain is behaving very nicely indeed,\" said Rovol, \"much better\nthan I would have thought possible from its size. In fact, it may be\npossible for me to transfer to you all the knowledge I have which might\nbe of use to you. That is why I took you away from the laboratory. What\ndo you think of the idea?\"\n\n\"Our psychologists have always maintained that none of us ever uses more\nthan a minute fraction of the actual capacity of his brain,\" Seaton\nreplied after a moment's thought. \"If you think you can give me even a\npercentage of your knowledge without killing me, go to it--I'm for it,\nstrong!\"\n\n\"Knowing that you would be, I have already requested Drasnik, the First\nof Psychology, to come here, and he has just arrived,\" answered Rovol.\nAnd as he spoke, that personage entered the room.\n\nWhen the facts had been set before him, the psychologist nodded his head\n\n\"That is quite possible,\" he said with enthusiasm, \"and I will be only\ntoo glad to assist in such an operation.\"\n\n\"But listen!\" protested Seaton, \"You'll probably change my whole\npersonality! Rovol's brain is three times the size of mine.\"\n\n\"Tut-tut--nothing of the kind,\" Drasnik reproved him. \"As you have said,\nyou are using only a minute portion of the active mass of your brain.\nThe same thing is true with us--many millions of cycles would have to\npass before we would be able to fill the brains we now have.\"\n\n\"Then why are your brains so large?\"\n\n\"Merely a provision of Nature that no possible accession of knowledge\nshall find her storehouse too small,\" replied Drasnik, positively.\n\"Ready?\"\n\nAll three donned the headsets and a wave of mental force swept into\nSeaton's mind, a wave of such power that the Terrestrial's every sense\nwilted under the impact. He did not faint, he did not lose\nconsciousness--he simply lost all control of every nerve and fiber as\nhis entire brain passed into the control of the immense mentality of the\nFirst of Psychology and became a purely receptive, plastic medium upon\nwhich to impress the knowledge of the aged physicist.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHour after hour the transfer continued, Seaton lying limp as though\nlifeless, the two Norlaminians tense and rigid, every faculty\nconcentrated upon the ignorant, virgin brain exposed to their gaze.\nFinally the operation was complete and Seaton, released from the weird,\nhypnotic grip of that stupendous mind, gasped, shook himself, and\nwrithed to his feet.\n\n\"Great Cat!\" he exclaimed, his eyes wide with astonishment. \"I wouldn't\nhave believed there was as much to know in the entire Universe as I know\nright now, and I know it as well as I ever knew elementary algebra.\nThanks, fellows, a million times--but say, did you leave any open spaces\nfor more? In one way, I seem to know less than I did before, there's so\nmuch more to find out. Can I learn anything more, or did you fill me up\nto capacity?\"\n\nThe psychologist, who had been listening to the exuberant youth with\nundisguised pleasure, spoke calmly.\n\n\"The mere fact that you appreciate your comparative ignorance shows that\nyou are still capable of learning. Your capacity to learn is greater\nthan it ever was before, even though the waste space has been reduced.\nMuch to our surprise, Rovol and I gave you all of his knowledge that\nwould be of any use to you, and some of my own, and still theoretically\nyou can add to it more than nine times the total of your present\nknowledge.\"\n\nThe psychologist departed, and Rovol and Seaton returned to the\nlaboratory, where the forces were still merrily at work. There was\nnothing that could be done to hasten the connecting, and it was late in\nthe following period of labor before they could begin the actual\nconstruction of the projector. Once started, however, it progressed with\namazing rapidity. Now understanding the system, it did not seem strange\nto Seaton that he should merely actuate a certain combination of forces\nwhen he desired a certain operation performed; nor did it seem unusual\nor worthy of comment that one flick of his finger over that switchboard\nwould send a force a distance of hundreds of miles to a factory where\nother forces were busily at work, to seize a hundred angle-bars of\ntransparent purple metal that were to form the backbone of the\nfifth-order projector. Nor did it seem peculiar that the same force,\nwith no further instruction, should bring these hundred bars back to\nhim, in a high loop through the atmosphere; should deposit them gently\nin a convenient space near the site of operations; and then should\ndisappear as though it had never existed! With such tools as that, it\nwas a matter of only a few hours before the projector was done--a task\nthat would have required years of planning and building upon Earth.\n\nTwo hundred and fifty feet it towered above their heads, a tubular\nnetwork of braced and latticed bars of purple metal, fifty feet in\ndiameter at the base and tapering smoothly to a diameter of about ten\nfeet at the top. Built of a metal thousands of times as strong and hard\nas steel, it was not cumbersome in appearance, and yet was strong enough\nto be absolutely rigid. Ten enormous supporting forces held the lens of\nneutronium immovable in the exact center of the upper end; at intervals\ndown the shaft similar forces held variously-shaped lenses and prisms\nformed from zones of force; in the center of the bottom or floor of the\ntowering structure was the double controlling system, with a universal\nvisiplate facing each operator.\n\n\"Well, Rovol, that's that,\" remarked Seaton as the last connection was\nmade. \"What say we hop in and give the baby a ride over to the Area of\nExperiment? Caslor must have the mounting done, and we've got time\nenough left in this period to try her out.\"\n\n\"In a moment. I am setting the fourth-order projector to go out to the\ndwarf star after an additional supply of neutronium.\"\n\nSeaton, knowing from the data of their first journey, that the controls\ncould be so set as to duplicate their feat in every particular without\nsupervision, stepped into his seat in the new controller, pressed a key,\nand spoke.\n\n\"Hi, Dottie, what's on your mind?\"\n\n\"Nothing much,\" Dorothy's clear voice answered. \"Got it done and can I\nsee it?\"\n\n\"Sure--sit tight and I'll send a boat after you.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Rovol's flier darted into the air and away; and in two\nminutes it returned, slowing abruptly as it landed. Dorothy stepped out,\nradiant, and returned Seaton's enthusiastic caresses with equal fervor\nbefore she spoke.\n\n\"Lover, I'm afraid you violated all known speed laws getting me over\nhere. Aren't you afraid of getting pinched?\"\n\n\"Nope--not here. Besides, I didn't want to keep Rovol waiting--we're all\nready to go. Hop in here with me, this left-hand control's mine.\"\n\nRovol entered the tube, took his place, and waved his hand. Seaton's\nhands swept over the keys and the whole gigantic structure wafted into\nthe air. Still upright, it was borne upon immense rods of force toward\nthe Area of Experiment, which was soon reached. Covered as the Area was\nwith fantastic equipment, there was no doubt as to their destination,\nfor in plain sight, dominating all the lesser instruments, there rose a\nstupendous telescopic mounting, with an enormous hollow tube of metallic\nlattice-work which could be intended for nothing else than their\nprojector. Approaching it carefully, Seaton deftly guided the projector\nlengthwise into that hollow receptacle and anchored it in the exact\noptical axis. Flashing beams of force made short work of welding the two\ntubes together immovably with angles and lattices of the same purple\nmetal, the terminals of the variable-speed motors were attached to the\ncontrollers, and everything was in readiness for the first trial.\n\n\"What special instructions do we need to run it, if any?\" Seaton asked\nof the First of Mechanism, who had lifted himself up into the projector.\n\n\"Very little. This motor governs the hour motion, that one the right\nascension. The potentiometers regulate the degree of vernier action--any\nratio is possible, from direct drive up to more than a hundred million\ncomplete revolutions of that graduated dial to give you one second of\narc.\"\n\n\"Plenty fine, I'd say. Thanks a lot, ace. Whither away, Rovol--any\nchoice?\"\n\n\"Anywhere you please, son, since this is merely a try-out.\"\n\n\"O. K. We'll hop over and tell Dunark hello.\"\n\nThe tube swung around into line with that distant planet and Seaton\nstepped down hard, upon a pedal. Instantly they seemed infinite myriads\nof miles out in space, the green system barely visible as a faint green\nstar behind them.\n\n\"Wow, that ray's fast!\" exclaimed the pilot, ruefully. \"I overshot about\na thousand light years. We'll try again, with considerably less power,\"\nand he rearranged and reset the dials and meters before him. Adjustment\nafter adjustment and many reductions in power had to be made before the\nprojection ceased leaping millions of miles at a touch, but finally the\noperators became familiar with the new technique and the ray became\nmanageable. Soon they were hovering above what had been Mardonal, and\nsaw that all signs of warfare had disappeared. Slowly turning the\ncontrols, Seaton flashed the projection over the girdling Osnomian sea\nand guided it through the impregnable metal walls of the palace into the\nthrone room of Roban, where they saw the Emperor, Tarnan the Karbix, and\nDunark in close conference.\n\n\"Well, here we are,\" remarked Seaton. \"Now we'll put on a little\nvisibility and give the natives a treat.\"\n\n\"Sh-sh,\" whispered Dorothy, \"they'll hear you, Dick--we're intruding\nshamefully.\"\n\n\"No, they won't hear us, because I haven't heterodyned the audio in on\nthe wave yet. And as for intruding, that's exactly what we came over\nhere for.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe imposed the audio system upon the inconceivably high frequency of\ntheir carrier wave and spoke in the Osnomian tongue.\n\n\"Greetings, Roban, Dunark, and Tarnan, from Seaton.\" All three jumped to\ntheir feet, amazed, staring about the empty room as Seaton went on, \"I\nam not here in person. I am simply sending you my projection. Just a\nmoment and I will put on a little visibility.\"\n\nHe brought more forces into play, and solid images of force appeared in\nthe great hall; images of the three occupants of the controller.\nIntroductions and greetings over, Seaton spoke briefly and to the point.\n\n\"We've got everything we came after--much more than I had any idea we\ncould get. You need have no more fear of the Fenachrone--we have found a\nscience superior to theirs. But much remains to be done, and we have\nnone too much time; therefore I have come to you with certain requests.\"\n\n\"The Overlord has but to command,\" replied Roban.\n\n\"Not command, since we are all working together for a common cause. In\nthe name of that cause, Dunark, I ask you to come to me at once,\naccompanied by Tarnan and any others you may select. You will be piloted\nby a ray which we shall set upon your controls. Upon your way here you\nwill visit the First City of Dasor, another planet, where you will pick\nup Sacner Carfon, who will be awaiting you there.\"\n\n\"As you direct, so it shall be,\" and Seaton flashed the projector to the\nneighboring planet of Urvania. There he found that the gigantic\nspace-cruiser he had ordered had been completed, and requested Urvan and\nhis commander-in-chief to tow it to Norlamin, piloted by a ray. He then\njumped to Dasor, there interviewing Carfon and being assured of the full\nco-operation of the porpoise-men.\n\n\"Well, that's that, folks,\" said Seaton as he shut off the power. \"We\ncan't do much more for a few days, until the gang gets here for the\ncouncil of war. How'd it be, Rovol, for me to practice with this outfit\nwhile you are finishing up the odds and ends you want to clean up? You\nmight suggest to Orlon, too, that it'd be a good deed for him to pilot\nthose folks over here.\"\n\nAs Rovol wafted himself to the ground from their lofty station, Crane\nand Margaret appeared and were lifted up to the place formerly occupied\nby the physicist.\n\n\"How's tricks, Mart? I hear you're quite an astronomer?\" said Seaton.\n\n\"Yes, thanks to Orlon and the First of Psychology. He seemed quite\ninterested in increasing our Earthly knowledge. I certainly know much\nmore than I had ever hoped to know of anything.\"\n\n\"Yeah, you can pilot us to the Fenachrone system now without any\ntrouble. You also absorbed some ethnology and kindred sciences. What\nd'you think--with Dunark and Urvan, do we know enough to go ahead or\nshould we take a chance on holding things up while we get acquainted\nwith some of the other peoples of these planets of the green system?\"\n\n\"Delay is dangerous, as our time is already short,\" Crane replied after\na time. \"We know enough, I believe; and furthermore, any additional\nassistance is problematical; in fact, it is more than doubtful. The\nNorlaminians have surveyed the system rather thoroughly, and no other\nplanet seems to have inhabitants who have even approached the\ndevelopment attained here.\"\n\n\"Right--that's the way I dope it, exactly. We'll wait until the gang\nassembles, then go over the top. In the meantime, I called you over to\ntake a ride in this projector--it's a darb. I'd like to shoot for the\nFenachrone system first, but I don't quite dare to.\"\n\n\"Don't _dare_ to? You?\" scoffed Margaret. \"How come?\"\n\n\"Cancel the 'dare'--change it to 'prefer not to.' Why? Because while\nthey can't work through a zone of force, some of their real\nscientists--and they have lots of them, not like the bull-headed soldier\nwe captured--may well be able to detect a fifth-order ray--even if they\ncan't work with them intelligently--and if they detected our ray, it'd\nput them on guard.\"\n\n\"You are exactly right, Dick,\" agreed Crane. \"And there speaks the\nNorlaminian physicist, and not my old and reckless playmate Richard\nSeaton.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know--I told you I was getting timid as a mouse. But let's\nnot sit here twiddling our thumbs--let's go places and do things.\nWhither away? I want a destination a good ways off, not something in our\nown back yard.\"\n\n\"Go back home, of course, stupe,\" put in Dorothy, \"do you have to be\ntold every little thing?\"\n\n\"Sure--never thought of that,\" and Seaton, after a moment's rapid mental\narithmetic, swung the great tube around, rapidly adjusted a few dials,\nand stepped down upon a pedal. There was a fleeting instant of\nunthinkable velocity; then they found themselves poised somewhere in\nspace.\n\n\"Well, wonder how far I missed it on my first shot?\" Seaton's crisp\nvoice broke the stunned silence. \"Guess that's our sun, over to the\nleft, ain't it, Mart?\"\n\n\"Yes. You were about right for distance, and within a few tenths of a\nlight-year laterally. That is fairly close, I should have said.\"\n\n\"Rotten, for these controls. Except for the effect of relative proper\nmotions, which I can't calculate yet for lack of data. I should be able\nto hit a gnat right in the left eye at this range--and the difference in\nproper motions couldn't have thrown me off more than a few hundred feet.\nNope, I was too anxious--hurried too much on the settings of the slow\nverniers. I'll snap back and try it again.\"\n\nHe adjusted the verniers very carefully, and again threw on the power.\nAgain there was the sensation of the barest perceptible moment of\nunimaginable speed, and they were in the air some fifty feet above the\nground of Crane Field, almost above the testing shed. Seaton rapidly\nadjusted the variable-speed motors until they were perfectly stationary,\nrelative to the surface of the earth.\n\n\"You are improving,\" commended Crane.\n\n\"Yeah--that's more like it. Guess maybe I can learn in time to shoot\nthis gun. Well, let's go down.\"\n\nThey dropped through the roof into the laboratory where Maxwell, now in\ncharge of the place, was watching a reaction and occasionally taking\nnotes.\n\n\"Hi, Max! Seaton speaking, on a television. Got your range?\"\n\n\"Exactly, Chief, apparently. I can hear you perfectly, but can't see\nanything,\" Maxwell stared about the empty laboratory.\n\n\"You will in a minute. I knew I had you, but didn't want to scare you\nout of a year's growth,\" and Seaton thickened the image until they were\nplainly visible.\n\n\"Please call Mr. Vaneman on the phone and tell him you're in touch with\nus,\" directed Seaton as soon as greetings had been exchanged. \"Better\nyet, after you've broken it to them gently, Dot can talk to them, then\nwe'll go over and see 'em.\"\n\nThe connection established, Dorothy's image floated up to the telephone\nand apparently spoke.\n\n\"Mother? This is the weirdest thing you ever imagined. We're not really\nhere at all you know--we're actually here in Norlamin--no, I mean Dick's\njust sending a kind of a talking picture of us to see you on earth\nhere.... Oh, no, I don't know anything about it--it's like a talkie sent\nby radio, only worse, because I am saying this myself right now, without\nany rehearsal or anything ... we didn't want to burst in on you without\nwarning, because you'd be sure to think you were seeing actual ghosts,\nand we're not dead the least bit ... we're having the most perfectly\ngorgeous time you ever imagined.... Oh, I'm so excited I can't explain\nanything, even if I knew anything about it to explain. We'll all four of\nus be over there in about a second and tell you all about it. 'Bye!\"\n\nIndeed, it was even less than a second--Mrs. Vaneman was still in the\nact of hanging up the receiver when the image materialized in the living\nroom of Dorothy's girlhood home.\n\n\"Hello, mother and dad,\" Seaton's voice was cheerful but matter-of-fact.\n\"I'll thicken this up so you can see us better in a minute. But don't\nthink that we are flesh and blood. You'll see simply three-dimensional\ntalking pictures of ourselves, transmitted by radio.\"\n\nFor a long time Mr. and Mrs. Vaneman chatted with the four visitors from\nso far away in space, while Seaton gloried in the working of that\nmarvelous projector.\n\n\"Well, our time's about up,\" Seaton finally ended the visit. \"The\nquitting-whistle's going to blow in five minutes, and they don't like\novertime work here where we are. We'll drop in and see you again maybe,\nsometime before we come back.\"\n\n\"Do you know yet when you are coming back?\" asked Mrs. Vaneman.\n\n\"Not an idea in the world, mother, any more than we had when we started.\nBut we're getting along fine, having the time of our lives, and are\nlearning a lot besides. So-long!\" and Seaton clicked off the power.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs they descended from the projector and walked toward the waiting\nairboat, Seaton fell in beside Rovol.\n\n\"You know they've got our new cruiser built of dagal, and are bringing\nit over here. Dagal's good stuff, but it isn't as good as your purple\nmetal, inoson, which is the theoretical ultimate in strength possible\nfor any material possessing molecular structure. Why wouldn't it be a\nsound idea to flash it into inoson when it gets here?\"\n\n\"That would be an excellent idea, and we shall do so. It also has\noccurred to me that Caslor of Mechanism, Astron of Energy, Satrazon of\nChemistry, myself, and one of two others, should collaborate in\ninstalling a very complete fifth-order projector in the new _Skylark_,\nas well as any other equipment which may seem desirable. The security of\nthe Universe may depend upon the abilities and qualities of you\nTerrestrials and your vessel, and therefore _nothing_ should be left\nundone which it is possible for us to do.\"\n\n\"You chirped something then, old scout--thanks. You might do that, while\nI attend to such preliminaries as wiping out the Fenachrone fleet.\"\n\nIn due time the reinforcements from the other planets arrived, and the\nmammoth space-cruiser attracted attention even before it landed, so\nenormous was she in comparison with the tiny vessels having her in tow.\nResting upon the ground, it seemed absurd that such a structure could\npossibly move under her own power. For two miles that enormous mass of\nmetal extended over the country-side, and while it was very narrow for\nits length, still its fifteen hundred feet of diameter dwarfed\neverything near by. But Rovol and his aged co-workers smiled happily as\nthey saw it, erected their keyboards, and set to work with a will.\n\nMeanwhile a group had gathered about a conference table--a group such as\nhad never before been seen together upon any world. There was Fodan, the\nancient Chief of the Five of Norlamin, huge-headed, with his leonine\nmane and flowing beard of white. There were Dunark and Tarnan of Osnome\nand Urvan of Urvania--smooth-faced and keen, utterly implacable and\nruthless in war. There was Sacner Carfon Twenty Three Forty Six, the\nimmense, porpoise-like, hairless Dasorian. There were Seaton and Crane,\nrepresentatives of our own Earthly civilization.\n\nSeaton opened the meeting by handing each man a headset and running a\nreel showing the plans of the Fenachrone; not only as he had secured\nthem from the captain of the marauding vessel, but also everything the\nFirst of Psychology had deduced from his own study of that inhuman\nbrain. He then removed the reel and gave them the tentative plans of\nbattle. Headsets removed, he threw the meeting open for discussion--and\ndiscussion there was in plenty. Each man had ideas, which were thrown\nupon the table and studied, for the most part calmly and\ndispassionately. The conference continued until only one point was left,\nupon which argument waxed so hot that everyone seemed shouting at once.\n\n\"Order!\" commanded Seaton, banging his fist upon the table. \"Osnome and\nUrvania wish to strike without warning, Norlamin and Dasor insist upon a\nformal declaration of war. Earth has the deciding vote. Mart, how do we\nvote on this?\"\n\n\"I vote for formal warning, for two reasons, one of which I believe will\nconvince even Dunark. First, because it is the fair thing to do--which\nreason is, of course, the one actuating the Norlaminians, but which\nwould not be considered by Osnome, nor even remotely understood by the\nFenachrone. Second, I am certain that the Fenachrone will merely be\nenraged by the warning and will defy us. Then what will they do? You\nhave already said that you have been able to locate only a few of their\nexploring warships. As soon as we declare war upon them they will almost\ncertainly send out torpedoes to every one of their ships of war. We can\nthen follow the torpedoes with our rays, and thus will be enabled to\nfind and to destroy their vessels.\"\n\n\"That settles that,\" declared the chairman as a shout of agreement\narose. \"We shall now adjourn to the projector and send the warning. I\nhave a ray upon the torpedo, announcing the destruction by us of their\nvessel, and that torpedo will arrive at its destination in less than an\nhour. It seems to me that we should make our announcement immediately\nafter their ruler has received the news of their first defeat.\"\n\nIn the projector, where they were joined by Rovol, Orlon, and several\nothers of the various \"Firsts\" of Norlamin, they flashed out to the\nflying torpedo, and Seaton grinned at Crane as their fifth-order carrier\nbeam went through the far-flung detector screens of the Fenachrone\nwithout setting up the slightest reaction. In the wake of that speeding\nmessenger they flew through a warm, foggy, dense atmosphere, through a\nreceiving trap in the wall of a gigantic conical structure, and on into\nthe telegraph room. They saw the operator remove spools of tape from the\ntorpedo and attach them to a magnetic sender--heard him speak.\n\n\"Pardon, your majesty--we have just received a first-degree emergency\ntorpedo from flagship Y427W of fleet 42. In readiness.\"\n\n\"Put it on, here in the council chamber,\" a deep voice snapped.\n\n\"If he's broadcasting it, we're in for a spell of hunting,\" Seaton\nremarked. \"Nope, he's putting it on a tight beam--that's fine, we can\nchase it up,\" and with a narrow detector beam he traced the invisible\ntransmission beam into the council room.\n\n\"'Sfunny. This place seems awfully familiar--I'd swear I'd seen it\nbefore, lots of times--seems like I've been in it, more than once,\"\nSeaton remarked, puzzled, as he looked around the somber room, with its\ndull, paneled metal walls covered with charts, maps, screens, and\nspeakers; and with its low, massive furniture. \"Oh, sure, I'm familiar\nwith it from studying the brain of that Fenachrone captain. Well, while\nHis Nibs is absorbing the bad news, we'll go over this once more. You,\nCarfon, having the biggest voice of any of us ever heard uttering\nintelligible language, are to give the speech. You know about what to\nsay. When I say 'go ahead' do your stuff. Now, everybody else, listen.\nWhile he's talking I've got to have audio waves heterodyned both ways in\nthe circuit, and they'll be able to hear any noise any of us make--so\nall of us except Carfon want to keep absolutely quiet, no matter what\nhappens or what we see. As soon as he's done I'll cut off the audio\nsending and say something to let you all know we're off the air. Got\nit?\"\n\n\"One point has occurred to me about handling the warning,\" boomed\nCarfon. \"If it should be delivered from apparently empty air, directly\nat those we wish to address, it would give the enemy an insight into our\nmethods, which might be undesirable.\"\n\n\"H--m--m. Never thought of that ... it sure would, and it would be\nundesirable,\" agreed Seaton. \"Let's see ... we can get away from that by\nbroadcasting it. They have a very complete system of speakers, but no\nmatter how many private-band speakers a man may have, he always has one\non the general wave, which is used for very important announcements of\nwide interest. I'll broadcast you on that wave, so that every\ngeneral-wave speaker on the planet will be energized. That way, it'll\nlook as if we're shooting from a distance. You might talk accordingly.\"\n\n\"If we have a minute more, there's something I would like to ask,\"\nDunark broke the ensuing silence. \"Here we are, seeing everything that\nis happening there. Walls, planets, even suns, do not bar our vision,\nbecause of the fifth-order carrier wave. I understand that, partially.\nBut how can we see anything there? I always thought that I knew\nsomething about rays, but I see that I do not. The light-rays must be\nreleased, or deheterodyned, close to the object viewed, with nothing\nopaque to light intervening. They must then be reflected from the object\nseen, must be gathered together, again heterodyned upon the fifth-order\ncarrier, and retransmitted back to us. And there is neither receiver nor\ntransmitter at the other end. How can you do all that from our end?\"\n\n\"We don't,\" Seaton assured him. \"At the other end there are all the\nthings you mentioned, and a lot more besides. Our secondary projector\nout there is composed of forces, visible or invisible, as we please.\nPart of those forces comprise the receiving, viewing, and sending\ninstruments. They are not material, it is true, but they are\nnevertheless fully as actual, and far more efficient, than any other\nsystem of radio, television, or telephone in existence anywhere else. It\nis force, you know, that makes radio or television work--the actual\ncopper, insulation, and other matter serve only to guide and to control\nthe various forces employed. The Norlaminian scientists have found out\nhow to direct and control pure forces without using the cumbersome and\nhindering material substance....\"\n\nHe broke off as the record from the torpedo stopped suddenly and the\noperator's voice came through a speaker.\n\n\"General Fenimol! Scoutship K3296, patrolling the detector zone, wishes\nto give you an urgent emergency report. I told them that you were in\ncouncil with the Emperor, and they instructed me to interrupt it, no\nmatter how important the council may be. They have on board a survivor\nof the Y427W, and have captured and killed two men of the same race as\nthose who destroyed our vessel. They say that you will want their report\nwithout an instant's delay.\"\n\n\"We do!\" barked the general, at a sign from his ruler. \"Put it on here.\nRun the rest of the torpedo report immediately afterward.\"\n\nIn the projector, Seaton stared at Crane a moment, then a light of\nunderstanding spread over his features.\n\n\"DuQuesne, of course--I'll bet a hat no other Terrestrial is this far\nfrom home. I can't help feeling sorry for the poor devil--he's a darn\ngood man gone wrong--but we'd have had to kill him ourselves before we\ngot done with him; so it's probably as well they got him. Pin your ears\nback, everybody, and watch close--we want to get this, all of it.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nThe Declaration of War\n\n\nThe capital city of the Fenachrone lay in a jungle plain surrounded by\ntowering hills. A perfect circle of immense diameter, its buildings of\nuniform height, of identical design, and constructed of the same dull\ngray, translucent metal, were arranged in concentric circles, like the\nannular rings seen upon the stump of a tree. Between each ring of\nbuildings and the one next inside it there were lagoons, lawns and\ngroves--lagoons of tepid, sullenly-steaming water; lawns which were\nveritable carpets of lush, rank rushes and of dank mosses; groves of\npalms, gigantic ferns, bamboos, and numerous tropical growths unknown to\nEarthly botany. At the very edge of the city began jungle unrelieved and\nprimeval; the impenetrable, unconquerable jungle, possible only to such\nmeteorological conditions as obtained there. Wind there was none, nor\nsunshine. Only occasionally was the sun of that reeking world visible\nthrough the omnipresent fog, a pale, wan disk; always the atmosphere was\none of oppressive, hot, humid vapor. In the exact center of the city\nrose an immense structure, a terraced cone of buildings, as though\nimmense disks of smaller and smaller diameter had been piled one upon\nthe other. In these apartments dwelt the nobility and the high officials\nof the Fenachrone. In the highest disk of all, invisible always from the\nsurface of the planet because of the all-enshrouding mist, were the\napartments of the Emperor of that monstrous race.\n\nSeated upon low, heavily-built metal stools about the great table in the\ncouncil-room were Fenor, Emperor of the Fenachrone; Fenimol, his\nGeneral-in-Command, and the full Council of Eleven of the planet. Being\nprojected in the air before them was a three-dimensional moving, talking\npicture--the report of the sole survivor of the warship that had\nattacked the _Skylark II_. In exact accordance with the facts as the\nengineer knew them, the details of the battle and complete information\nconcerning the conquerors were shown. As vividly as though the scene\nwere being re-enacted before their eyes they saw the captive revive in\nthe _Violet_, and heard the conversation between the engineer, DuQuesne,\nand Loring.\n\nIn the _Violet_ they sped for days and weeks, with ever-mounting\nvelocity, toward the system of the Fenachrone. Finally, power reversed,\nthey approached it, saw the planet looming large, and passed within the\ndetector screen.\n\nDuQuesne tightened the controls of the attractors, which had never been\nentirely released from their prisoner, thus again pinning the Fenachrone\nhelplessly against the wall.\n\n\"Just to be sure you don't try to start something,\" he explained coldly.\n\"You have done well so far, but I'll run things myself from now on, so\nthat you can't steer us into a trap. Now tell me exactly how to go\nabout getting one of your vessels. After we get it, I'll see about\nletting you go.\"\n\n\"Fools, you are too late! You would have been too late, even had you\nkilled me out there in space and had fled at your utmost acceleration.\nDid you but know it, you are as dead, even now--our patrol is upon you!\"\n\nDuQuesne whirled, snarling, and his automatic and that of Loring were\nleaping out when an awful acceleration threw them flat upon the floor, a\nmagnetic force snatched away their weapons, and a heat-ray reduced them\nto two small piles of gray ash. Immediately thereafter a beam of force\nfrom the patrolling cruiser neutralized the retractors bearing upon the\ncaptive, and he was transferred to the rescuing vessel.\n\nThe emergency report ended, and with a brief \"Torpedo message from\nflagship Y427W resumed at point of interruption,\" the report from the\nill-fated vessel continued the story of its own destruction, but added\nlittle in the already complete knowledge of the disaster.\n\nFenor of the Fenachrone leaped up from the table, his terrible,\nflame-shot eyes glaring venomously--teetering in Berserk rage upon his\nblock-like legs--but he did not for one second take his full attention\nfrom the report until it had been completed. Then he seized the nearest\nobject, which happened to be his chair, and with all his enormous\nstrength hurled it across the floor, where it lay, a tattered, twisted,\nshapeless mass of metal.\n\n\"Thus shall we treat the entire race of the accursed beings who have\ndone this!\" he stormed, his heavy voice reverberating throughout the\nroom. \"Torture, dismemberment and annihilation to every....\"\n\n\"Fenor of the Fenachrone!\" a tremendous voice, a full octave lower than\nFenor's own terrific bass, and of ear-shattering volume and timbre in\nthat dense atmosphere boomed from the general-wave speaker, its\ndeafening roar drowning out Fenor's raging voice and every other lesser\nsound.\n\n\"Fenor of the Fenachrone! I know that you hear, for every general-wave\nspeaker upon your reeking planet is voicing my words. Listen well, for\nthis warning shall not be repeated. I am speaking by and with the\nauthority of the Overlord of the Green System, which you know as the\nCentral System of this, our Galaxy. Upon some of our many planets there\nare those who wished to destroy you without warning and out of hand, but\nthe Overlord has ruled that you may continue to live provided you heed\nthese, his commands, which he has instructed me to lay upon you.\n\n\"You must forthwith abandon forever your vainglorious and senseless\nscheme of universal conquest. You must immediately withdraw your every\nvessel to within the boundaries of your solar system, and you must keep\nthem there henceforth.\n\n\"You are allowed five minutes to decide whether or not you will obey\nthese commands. If no answer has been received at the end of the\ncalculated time the Overlord will know that you have defied him, and\nyour entire race shall perish utterly. Well he knows that your very\nexistence is an affront to all real civilization, but he holds that even\nsuch vileness incarnate, as are the Fenachrone, may perchance have some\nobscure place in the Great Scheme of Things, and he will not destroy you\nif you are content to remain in your proper place, upon your own dank\nand steaming world. Through me, the two thousand three hundred and\nforty-sixth Sacner Carfon of Dasor, the Overlord has given you your\nfirst, last and only warning. Heed its every word, or consider it the\nformal declaration of a war of utter and complete extinction!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe awful voice ceased and pandemonium reigned in the council hall.\nObeying a common impulse, each Fenachrone leaped to his feet, raised his\nhuge arms aloft, and roared out rage and defiance. Fenor snapped a\ncommand, and the others fell silent as he began howling out orders.\n\n\"Operator! Send recall torpedoes instantly to every outlying vessel!\" He\nscuttled over to one of the private-band speakers. \"X-794-PW! Radio\ngeneral call for all vessels above E blank E to concentrate on battle\nstations! Throw out full-power defensive screens, and send the full\nseries of detector screens out to the limit! Guards and patrols on\ninvasion plan XB-218!\"\n\n\"The immediate steps are taken, gentlemen!\" He turned to the Council,\nhis rage unabated. \"Never before have we supermen of the Fenachrone been\nso insulted and so belittled! That upstart Overlord will regret that\nwarning to the instant of his death, which shall be exquisitely\npostponed. All you of the Council know your duties in such a time as\nthis--you are excused to perform them. General Fenimol, you will stay\nwith me--we shall consider together such other details as require\nattention.\"\n\nAfter the others had left the room Fenor turned to the general.\n\n\"Have you any immediate suggestions?\"\n\n\"I would suggest sending at once for Ravindau, the Chief of the\nLaboratories of Science. He certainly heard the warning, and may be able\nto cast some light upon how it could have been sent, and from what point\nit came.\"\n\nThe Emperor spoke into another sender, and soon the scientist entered,\ncarrying in his hand a small instrument upon which a blue light blazed.\n\n\"Do not talk here, there is grave danger of being overheard by that\nself-styled Overlord,\" he directed tersely, and led the way into a\nray-proof compartment of his private laboratory, several floors below.\n\n\"It may interest you to know that you have sealed the doom of our planet\nand of all the Fenachrone upon it,\" Ravindau spoke savagely.\n\n\"Dare you speak thus to me, your sovereign?\" roared Fenor.\n\n\"I dare so,\" replied the other, coldly. \"When all the civilization of a\nplanet has been given to destruction by the unreasoning stupidity and\ninsatiable rapacity of its royalty, allegiance to such royalty is at an\nend. SIT DOWN!\" he thundered as Fenor sprang to his feet. \"You are no\nlonger in your throne-room, surrounded by servile guards and by\nautomatic rays. You are in MY laboratory, and by a movement of my finger\nI can hurl you into eternity!\"\n\nThe general, aware now that the warning was of much more serious import\nthan he had suspected, broke into the acrimonious debate.\n\n\"Never mind questions of royalty!\" he snapped. \"The safety of the race\nis paramount. Am I to understand that the situation is really grave?\"\n\n\"It is worse than grave--it is desperate. The only hope for even\nultimate triumph is for as many of us as possible to flee instantly\nclear out of the Galaxy, in the hope that we may escape the certain\ndestruction to be dealt out to us by the Overlord of the Green System.\"\n\n\"You speak folly, surely,\" returned Fenimol. \"Our science is--must\nbe--superior to any other in the Universe?\"\n\n\"So thought I until this warning came in and I had an opportunity to\nstudy it. Then I knew that we are opposed by a science immeasurably\nhigher than our own.\"\n\n\"Such vermin as those two whom one of our smallest scouts captured\nwithout a battle, vessel and all? In what respects is their science even\ncomparable to ours?\"\n\n\"Not those vermin, no. The one who calls himself the Overlord. That one\nis our master. He can penetrate the impenetrable shield of force and can\noperate mechanisms of pure force behind it; he can heterodyne, transmit,\nand use the infra-rays, of whose very existence we were in doubt until\nrecently! While that warning was being delivered he was, in all\nprobability, watching you and listening to you, face to face. You in\nyour ignorance supposed his warning borne by the ether, and thought\ntherefore he must be close to this system. He is very probably at home\nin the Central System, and is at this moment preparing the forces he\nintends to hurl against us.\"\n\nThe Emperor fell back into his seat, all his pomposity gone, but the\ngeneral stiffened eagerly and went straight to the point.\n\n\"How do you know these things?\"\n\n\"Largely by deduction. We of the school of science have cautioned you\nrepeatedly to postpone the Day of Conquest until we should have mastered\nthe secrets of sub-rays and of infra-rays. Unheeding, you of war have\ngone ahead with your plans, while we of science have continued to study.\nWe know a little of the sub-rays, which we use every day, and\npractically nothing of the infra-rays. Some time ago I developed a\ndetector for infra-rays, which come to us from outer space in small\nquantities and which are also liberated by our power-plants. It has been\nregarded as a scientific curiosity only, but this day it proved of real\nvalue. This instrument in my hand is such a detector. At normal impacts\nof infra-rays its light is blue, as you see it now. Some time before the\nwarning sounded it turned a brilliant red, indicating that an intense\nsource of infra-rays was operating in the neighborhood. By plotting\nlines of force I located the source as being in the air of the council\nhall, almost directly above the table of state. Therefore the carrier\nwave must have come through our whole system of screens without so much\nas giving an alarm. That fact alone proves it to have been an infra-ray.\nFurthermore, it carried through those screens and released in the\ncouncil room a system of forces of great complexity, as is shown by\ntheir ability to broadcast from those pure forces without material aid a\nmodulated wave in the exact frequency required to energize our general\nspeakers.\n\n\"As soon as I perceived these facts I threw about the council room a\nscreen of force entirely impervious to anything longer than ultra-rays.\nThe warning continued, and I then knew that our fears were only too well\ngrounded--that there is in this Galaxy somewhere a race vastly superior\nto ours in science and that our destruction is a matter of hours,\nperhaps of minutes.\"\n\n\"Are these ultra-rays, then, of such a dangerous character?\" asked the\ngeneral. \"I had supposed them to be of such infinitely high frequency\nthat they could be of no practical use whatever.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I have been trying for years to learn something of their nature, but\nbeyond working out a method for their detection and a method of possible\nanalysis that may or may not succeed I can do nothing with them. It is\nperfectly evident, however, that they lie below the level of the ether,\nand therefore have a velocity of propagation infinitely greater than\nthat of light. You may see for yourself, then, that to a science able to\nguide and control them, to make them act as carrier waves for any other\ndesired frequency--to do all of which the Overlord has this day shown\nhimself capable--they should theoretically afford weapons before which\nour every defense would be precisely as efficacious as so much vacuum.\nThink a moment! You know that we know nothing fundamental concerning\neven our servants, the sub-rays. If we really knew them we could utilize\nthem in thousands of ways as yet unknown to us. We work with the merest\nhandful of forces, empirically, while it is practically certain that the\nenemy has at his command the entire spectrum, visible and invisible,\nembracing untold thousands of bands of unknown but terrific\npotentiality.\"\n\n\"But he spoke of a calculated time necessary before our answer could be\nreceived. They must, then, be using vibrations in the ether.\"\n\n\"Not necessarily--not even probably. Would we ourselves reveal\nunnecessarily to an enemy the possession of such rays? Do not be\nchildish. No, Fenimol, and you, Fenor of the Fenachrone, instant and\nheadlong flight is our only hope of present salvation and of ultimate\ntriumph--flight to a far distant Galaxy, since upon no point in this one\nshall we be safe from the infra-beams of that self-styled Overlord.\"\n\n\"You snivelling coward! You pusillanimous bookworm!\" Fenor had regained\nhis customary spirit as the scientist explained upon what grounds his\nfears were based. \"Upon such a tenuous fabric of evidence would you have\nsuch a people as ours turn tail like beaten hounds? Because, forsooth,\nyou detect a peculiar vibration in the air, will you have it that we are\nto be invaded and destroyed forthwith by a race of supernatural ability?\nBah! Your calamity-howling clan has delayed the Day of Conquest from\nyear to year--I more than half believe that you yourself or some other\ntreacherous poltroon of your ignominious breed prepared and sent that\nwarning, in a weak and rat-brained attempt to frighten us into again\npostponing the Day of Conquest! Know now, spineless weakling, that the\ntime is ripe, and that the Fenachrone in their might are about to\nstrike. But you, foul traducer of your emperor, shall die the death of\nthe cur you are!\" The hand within his tunic moved and a vibrator burst\ninto operation.\n\n\"Coward I may be, and pusillanimous, and other things as well,\" the\nscientist replied stonily, \"but, unlike you, I am not a fool. These\nwalls, this very atmosphere, are fields of force that will transmit no\nrays directed by you. You weak-minded scion of a depraved and obscene\nhouse--arrogant, overbearing, rapacious, ignorant--your brain is too\nfeeble to realize that you are clutching at the Universe hundreds of\nyears before the time has come. You by your overweening pride and folly\nhave doomed our beloved planet--the most perfect planet in the Galaxy in\nits grateful warmth and wonderful dampness and fogginess--and our entire\nrace to certain destruction. Therefore you, fool and dolt that you are,\nshall die--for too long already have you ruled.\" He flicked a finger and\nthe body of the monarch shuddered as though an intolerable current of\nelectricity had traversed it, collapsed and lay still.\n\n\"It was necessary to destroy this that was our ruler,\" Ravindau\nexplained to the general. \"I have long known that you are not in favor\nof such precipitate action in the Conquest: hence all this talking upon\nmy part. You know that I hold the honor of Fenachrone dear, and that all\nmy plans are for the ultimate triumph of our race?\"\n\n\"Yes, and I begin to suspect that those plans have not been made since\nthe warning was received.\"\n\n\"My plans have been made for many years; and ever since an immediate\nConquest was decided upon I have been assembling and organizing the\nmeans to put them into effect. I would have left this planet in any\nevent shortly after the departure of the grand fleet upon its final\nexpedition--Fenor's senseless defiance of the Overlord has only made it\nnecessary for me to expedite my leave-taking.\"\n\n\"What do you intend to do?\"\n\n\"I have a vessel twice as large as the largest warship Fenor boasted;\ncompletely provisioned, armed, and powered for a cruise of one hundred\nyears at high acceleration. It is hidden in a remote fastness of the\njungle. I am placing in that vessel a group of the finest, brainiest,\nmost highly advanced and intelligent of our men and women, with their\nchildren. We shall journey at our highest speed to a certain distant\nGalaxy, where we shall seek out a planet similar in atmosphere,\ntemperature, and mass to the one upon which we now dwell. There we shall\nmultiply and continue our studies; and from that planet, in that day\nwhen we shall have attained sufficient knowledge, there shall descend\nupon the Central System of this Galaxy the vengeance of the Fenachrone.\nThat vengeance will be all the sweeter for the fact that it shall have\nbeen delayed.\"\n\n\"But how about libraries, apparatus and equipment? Suppose that we do\nnot live long enough to perfect that knowledge? And with only one vessel\nand a handful of men we could not cope with that accursed Overlord and\nhis navies of the void.\"\n\n\"Libraries are aboard, so are much apparatus and equipment. What we\ncannot take with us we can build. As for the knowledge I mentioned, it\nmay not be attained in your lifetime nor in mine. But the racial memory\nof the Fenachrone is long, as you know; and even if the necessary\nproblems are not solved until our descendants are sufficiently numerous\nto populate an entire planet, yet will those descendants wreak the\nvengeance of the Fenachrone upon the races of that hated one, the\nOverlord, before they go on with the Conquest of the Universe. Many\nquestions will arise, of course; but they shall be solved. Enough! Time\npasses rapidly, and all too long have I talked. I am using this time\nupon you because in my organization there is no soldier, and the\nFenachrone of the future will need your great knowledge of warfare. Are\nyou going with us?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Very well.\" Ravindau led the general through a door and into an airboat\nlying upon the terrace outside the laboratory. \"Drive us at speed to\nyour home, where we shall pick up your family.\"\n\nFenimol took the controls and laid a ray to his home--a ray serving a\ndouble purpose. It held the vessel upon its predetermined course through\nthat thick and sticky fog and also rendered collision impossible, since\nany two of these controller rays repelled each other to such a degree\nthat no two vessels could take paths which would bring them together.\nSome such provision had been found necessary ages ago, for all\nFenachrone craft were provided with the same space-annihilating drive,\nto which any comprehensible distance was but a journey of a few moments,\nand at that frightful velocity collision meant annihilation.\n\n\"I understand that you could not take any one of the military into your\nconfidence until you were ready to put your plans into effect,\" the\ngeneral conceded. \"How long will it take you to get ready to leave? You\nhave said that haste is imperative, and I therefore assume that you have\nalready warned the other members of the expedition.\"\n\n\"I flashed the emergency signal before I joined you and Fenor in the\ncouncil room. Each man of the organization has received that signal,\nwherever he may have been, and by this time most of them, with their\nfamilies, are on the way to the hidden cruiser. We shall leave this\nplanet in fifteen minutes from now at most--I dare not stay an instant\nlonger than is absolutely necessary.\"\n\nThe members of the general's family were bundled, amazed, into the\nairboat, which immediately flew along a ray laid by Ravindau to the\nsecret rendezvous.\n\nIn a remote and desolate part of the planet, concealed in the depths of\nthe towering jungle growth, a mammoth space-cruiser was receiving her\ncomplement of passengers. Airboats, flying at their terrific velocity\nthrough the heavy, steaming fog as closely-spaced as their controller\nrays would permit, flashed signals along their guiding beams, dove into\nthe apparently impenetrable jungle, and added their passengers to the\nthrong pouring into the great vessel.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs the minute of departure drew near, the feeling of tension aboard the\ncruiser increased and vigilance was raised to the maximum. None of the\npassengers had been allowed senders of any description, and now even the\nhair-line beams guiding the airboats were cut off, and received only\nwhen the proper code signal was heard. The doors were shut, no one was\nallowed outside, and everything was held in readiness for instant flight\nat the least alarm. Finally a scientist and his family arrived from the\nopposite side of the planet--the last members of the organization--and,\ntwenty-seven minutes after Ravindau had flashed his signal, the prow of\nthat mighty space-ship reared toward the perpendicular, poising its\nmassive length at the predetermined angle. There it halted momentarily,\nthen disappeared utterly, only a vast column of tortured and shattered\nvegetation, torn from the ground and carried for miles upward into the\nair by the vacuum of its wake, remaining to indicate the path taken by\nthe flying projectile.\n\nHour after hour the Fenachrone vessel bored on, with its frightful and\never-increasing velocity, through the ever-thinning stars, but it was\nnot until the last star had been passed, until everything before them\nwas entirely devoid of light, and until the Galaxy behind them began to\ntake on a well-defined lenticular aspect, that Ravindau would consent to\nleave the controls and to seek his hard-earned rest.\n\nDay after day and week after week went by, and the Fenachrone vessel\nstill held the rate of motion with which she had started out. Ravindau\nand Fenimol sat in the control cabin, staring out through the\nvisiplates, abstracted. There was no need of staring, and they were not\nreally looking, for there was nothing at which to look. Outside the\ntransparent metal hull of that monster of the trackless void, there was\nnothing visible. The Galaxy of which our Earth is an infinitesimal mote,\nthe Galaxy which former astronomers considered the Universe, was so far\nbehind that its immeasurable diameter was too small to affect the vision\nof the unaided eye. Other Galaxies lay at even greater distances away on\neither side. The Galaxy toward which they were making their stupendous\nflight was as yet untold millions of light-years distant. Nothing was\nvisible--before their gaze stretched an infinity of emptiness. No stars,\nno nebul\u00e6, no meteoric matter, nor even the smallest particle of cosmic\ndust--absolutely empty space. Absolute vacuum and absolute zero.\nAbsolute nothingness--a concept intrinsically impossible for the most\nhighly trained human mind to grasp.\n\nConscienceless and heartless monstrosities though they both were, by\nheredity and training, the immensity of the appalling lack of anything\ntangible oppressed them. Ravindau was stern and serious, Fenimol moody.\nFinally the latter spoke.\n\n\"It would be endurable if we knew what had happened, or if we ever could\nknow definitely, one way or the other, whether all this was necessary.\"\n\n\"We shall know, general, definitely. I am certain in my own mind, but\nafter a time, when we have settled upon our new home and when the\nOverlord shall have relaxed his vigilance, you shall come back to the\nsolar system of the Fenachrone in this vessel or a similar one. I know\nwhat you shall find--but the trip shall be made, and you shall yourself\nsee what was once our home planet, a seething sun, second only in\nbrilliance to the parent sun about which she shall still be revolving.\"\n\n\"Are we safe, even now--what of possible pursuit?\" asked Fenimol, and\nthe monstrous, flame-shot wells of black that were Ravindau's eyes\nalmost emitted tangible fires as he made reply:\n\n\"We are far from safe, but we grow stronger minute by minute. Fifty of\nthe greatest minds our world has ever known have been working from the\nmoment of our departure upon a line of investigation suggested to me by\ncertain things my instruments recorded during the visit of the\nself-styled Overlord. I cannot say anything yet: even to you--except\nthat the Day of Conquest may not be so far in the future as we have\nsupposed.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nInterstellar Extermination\n\n\n\"I hate to leave this meeting--it's great stuff\" remarked Seaton as he\nflashed down to the torpedo room at Fenor's command to send recall\nmessages to all outlying vessels, \"but this machine isn't designed to\nlet me be in more than two places at once. Wish it were--maybe after\nthis fracas is over we'll be able to incorporate something like that\ninto it.\"\n\nThe chief operator touched a lever and the chair upon which he sat, with\nall its control panels, slid rapidly across the floor toward an\napparently blank wall. As he reached it, a port opened a metal scroll\nappeared, containing the numbers and last reported positions of all\nFenachrone vessels outside the detector zone, and a vast magazine of\ntorpedoes came up through the floor, with an automatic loader to place a\ntorpedo under the operator's hand the instant its predecessor had been\nlaunched.\n\n\"Get Peg here quick, Mart--we need a stenographer. Till she gets here,\nsee what you can do in getting those first numbers before they roll off\nthe end of the scroll. No, hold it--as you were! I've got controls\nenough to put the whole thing on a recorder, so we can study it at our\nleisure.\"\n\nHaste was indeed necessary for the operator worked with uncanny\nquickness of hand. One fleeting glance at the scroll, a lightning\nadjustment of dials in the torpedo, a touch upon a tiny button, and a\nmessenger was upon its way. But quick as he was, Seaton's flying fingers\nkept up with him, and before each torpedo disappeared through the ether\ngate there was fastened upon it a fifth-order tracer ray that would\nnever leave it until the force had been disconnected at the gigantic\ncontrol board of the Norlaminian projector. One flying minute passed\nduring which seventy torpedoes had been launched, before Seaton spoke.\n\n\"Wonder how many ships they've got out, anyway? Didn't get any idea from\nthe brain-record. Anyway, Rovol, it might be a sound idea for you to\ninstall me some more tracer rays on this board, I've got only a couple\nof hundred, and that may not be enough--and I've got both hands full.\"\n\nRovol seated himself beside the younger man, like one organist joining\nanother at the console of a tremendous organ. Seaton's nimble fingers\nwould flash here and there, depressing keys and manipulating controls\nuntil he had exactly the required combination of forces centered upon\nthe torpedo next to issue. He then would press a tiny switch and upon a\npanel full of red-topped, numbered plungers; the one next in series\nwould drive home, transferring to itself the assembled beam and\nreleasing the keys for the assembly of other forces. Rovol's fingers\nwere also flying, but the forces he directed were seizing and shaping\nmaterial, as well as other forces. The Norlaminian physicist, set up one\nintegral, stepped upon a pedal, and a new red-topped stop precisely like\nthe others and numbered in order, appeared as though by magic upon the\npanel at Seaton's left hand. Rovol then leaned back in his seat--but the\nred-topped stops continued to appear, at the rate of exactly seventy per\nminute, upon the panel, which increased in width sufficiently to\naccommodate another row as soon as a row was completed.\n\nRovol bent a quizzical glance upon the younger scientist, who blushed a\nfiery red, rapidly set up another integral, then also leaned back in his\nplace, while his face burned deeper than before.\n\n\"That is better, son. Never forget that it is a waste of energy to do\nthe same thing twice with your hands and that if you know precisely what\nis to be done, you need not do it with your hands at all. Forces are\ntireless, and they neither slip nor make mistakes.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Rovol--I'll bet this lesson will make it stick in my mind,\ntoo.\"\n\n\"You are not thoroughly accustomed to using all your knowledge as yet.\nThat will come with practice, however, and in a few weeks you will be as\nthoroughly at home with forces as I am.\"\n\n\"Hope so, Chief, but it looks like a tall order to me.\"\n\nFinally the last torpedo was dispatched, the tube closed, and Seaton\nmoved the projection back up into the council chamber, finding it empty.\n\n\"Well, the conference is over--besides, we've got more important fish to\nfry. War has been declared, on both sides, and we've got to get busy.\nThey've got nine hundred and six vessels out, and every one of them has\ngot to go to Davy Jones' locker before we can sleep sound of nights. My\nfirst job'll have to be untangling those nine oh six forces, getting\nlines on each one of them, and seeing if I can project straight enough\nto find the ships before the torpedoes overtake them. Mart, you and\nOrlon, the astronomer, had better dope out the last reported positions\nof each of those vessels, so we'll know about where to hunt for them.\nRovol, you might send out a detector screen a few light years in\ndiameter, to be sure none of them slips a fast one over on us. By\nstarting it right here and expanding it gradually, you can be sure that\nno Fenachrone is inside it. Then we'll find a hunk of copper on that\nplanet somewhere, plate it with some of their own 'X' metal, and blow\nthem into Kingdom Come.\"\n\n\"May I venture a suggestion?\" asked Drasnik, the First of Psychology.\n\n\"Absolutely--nothing you've said so far has been idle chatter.\"\n\n\"You know, of course, that there are real scientists among the\nFenachrone; and you yourself have suggested that while they cannot\npenetrate the zone of force nor use fifth-order rays, yet they might\nknow about them in theory, might even be able to know when they were\nbeing used--detect them, in other words. Let us assume that such a\nscientist did detect your rays while you were there a short time ago.\nWhat would he do?\"\n\n\"Search me.... I bite, what would he do?\"\n\n\"He might do any one of several things, but if I read their nature\naright, such a one would gather up a few men and women--as many as he\ncould--and migrate to another planet. For he would of course grasp\ninstantly the fact that you had used fifth-order rays as carrier waves,\nand would be able to deduce your ability to destroy. He would also\nrealize that in the brief time allowed him, he could not hope to learn\nto control those unknown forces; and with his terribly savage and\nvengeful nature and intense pride of race, he would take every possible\nstep both to perpetuate his race and to obtain revenge. Am I right?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSeaton swung to his controls savagely, and manipulated dials and keys\nrapidly.\n\n\"Right as rain, Drasnik. There--I've thrown around them a fifth-order\ndetector screen, that they can't possibly neutralize. Anything that goes\nout through it will have a tracer slapped onto it. But say, it's been\nhalf an hour since war was declared--suppose we're too late? Maybe some\nof them have got away already, and if one couple of 'em has beat us to\nit, we'll have the whole thing to do over again a thousand years or so\nfrom now. You've got the massive intellect, Drasnik. What can we do\nabout it? We can't throw a detector screen all over the Galaxy.\"\n\n\"I would suggest that since you have now guarded against further exodus,\nit is necessary to destroy the planet for a time. Rovol and his\nco-workers have the other projector nearly done. Let them project me to\nthe world of the Fenachrone, where I shall conduct a thorough mental\ninvestigation. By the time you have taken care of the raiding vessels, I\nbelieve that I shall have been able to learn everything we need to\nknow.\"\n\n\"Fine--hop to it, and may there be lots of bubbles in your think-tank.\nAnybody else know of any other loop-holes I've left open?\"\n\nNo other suggestions were made, and each man bent to his particular\ntask. Crane at the star-chart of the Galaxy and Orlon at the Fenachrone\noperator's dispatching scroll rapidly worked out the approximate\npositions of the Fenachrone vessels, and marked them with tiny green\nlights in a vast model of the Galaxy which they had already caused\nforces to erect in the air of the projector's base. It was soon learned\nthat a few of the ships were exploring quite close to their home system;\nso close that the torpedoes, with their unthinkable acceleration, would\nreach them within a few hours. Ascertaining the stop-number of the\ntracer ray upon the torpedo which should first reach its destination,\nSeaton followed it from the stop upon his panel out to the flying\nmessenger. Now moving with a velocity many times that of light, it was,\nof course, invisible to direct vision; but to the light waves\nheterodyned upon the fifth-order projector rays, it was as plainly\nvisible as though it were stationary. Lining up the path of the\nprojectile accurately, he then projected himself forward in that exact\nline, with a flat detector-screen thrown out for half a light year upon\neach side of him. Setting the controls, he flashed ahead, the detector\nstopping him the instant that the invisible barrier encountered the\npower-plant of the exploring raider. An oscillator sounded a shrill and\nrising note, and Seaton slowly shifted his controls until he stood in\nthe control room of the enemy vessel.\n\nThe Fenachrone ship, a thousand feet long and more than a hundred feet\nin diameter, was tearing through space toward a brilliant blue-white\nstar. Her crew were at battle stations, her navigating officers peering\nintently into the operating visiplates, all oblivious to the fact that a\nstranger stood in their very midst.\n\n\"Well, here's the first one, gang,\" said Seaton, \"I hate like sin to do\nthis--it's altogether too much like pushing baby chickens into a creek\nto suit me, but it's a dirty job that's got to be done.\"\n\nAs one man, Orlon and the other remaining Norlaminians leaped out of the\nprojector and floated to the ground below.\n\n\"I expected that,\" remarked Seaton. \"They can't even think of a thing\nlike this without getting the blue willies--I don't blame them much, at\nthat. How about you, Carfon? You can be excused if you like.\"\n\n\"I want to watch those forces at work. I do not enjoy destruction, but\nlike you, I can make myself endure it.\"\n\nDunark, the fierce and bloodthirsty Osnomian prince, leaped to his feet,\nhis eyes flashing.\n\n\"That's one thing I never could get about you, Dick!\" he exclaimed in\nEnglish. \"How a man with your brains can be so soft--so sloppily\nsentimental, gets clear past me. You remind me of a bowl of mush--you\nwade around in slush clear to your ears. Faugh! It's their lives or\nours! Tell me what button to push and I'll be only too glad to push it.\nI wanted to blow up Urvania and you wouldn't let me; I haven't killed an\nenemy for ages, and that's my trade. Cut out the sob-sister act and for\nCat's sake, let's get busy!\"\n\n\"'At-a-boy, Dunark! That's tellin' 'im! But it's all right with me--I'll\nbe glad to let you do it. When I say 'shoot' throw in that plunger\nthere--number sixty-three.\"\n\nSeaton manipulated controls until two electrodes of force were clamped\nin place, one at either end of the huge power-bar of the enemy vessel;\nadjusted rheostats and forces to send a disintegrating current through\nthat massive copper cylinder, and gave the word. Dunark threw in the\nswitch with a vicious thrust, as though it were an actual sword which he\nwas thrusting through the vitals of one of the awesome crew, and the\nvery Universe exploded around them--exploded into one mad, searing\ncoruscation of blinding, dazzling light as the gigantic cylinder of\ncopper resolved itself instantaneously into the pure energy from which\nits metal originally had come into being.\n\nSeaton and Dunark staggered back from the visiplates, blinded by the\nintolerable glare of light, and even Crane, working at his model of the\ngalaxy, blinked at the intensity of the radiation. Many minutes passed\nbefore the two men could see through their tortured eyes.\n\n\"Zowie! That was fierce!\" exclaimed Seaton, when a slowly-returning\nperception of things other than dizzy spirals and balls of flame assured\nhim that his eyesight was not permanently gone. \"It's nothing but my own\nfool carelessness, too. I should have known that with all the light\nfrequencies in heterodyne for visibility, enough of that same stuff\nwould leak through to make strong medicine on these visiplates--for I\nknew that that bar weighed a hundred tons and would liberate energy\nenough to volatilize our Earth and blow the by-products clear to\nArcturus. How're you coming, Dunark? See anything yet?\"\n\n\"Coming along O. K. now, I guess--but I thought for a few minutes I'd\nbeen bloody well jobbed.\"\n\n\"I'll do better next time. I'll cut out the visible spectrum before the\nflash, and convert and reconvert the infra-red. That'll let us see what\nhappens, without the direct effect of the glare--won't burn our eyes\nout. What's my force number on the next nearest one, Mart?\"\n\n\"Twenty-nine.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSeaton fastened a detector ray upon stop twenty-nine of the tracer-ray\npanel and followed its beam of force out to the torpedo hastening upon\nits way toward the next doomed cruiser. Flashing ahead in its line as he\nhad done before, he located the vessel and clamped the electrodes of\nforce upon the prodigious driving bar. Again, as Dunark drove home the\ndetonating switch, there was a frightful explosion and a wild glare of\nfrenzied incandescence far out in that desolate region of interstellar\nspace; but this time the eyes behind the visiplates were not torn by the\nhigh frequencies, everything that happened was plainly visible. One\ninstant, there was an immense space-cruiser boring on through the void\nupon its horrid mission, with its full complement of the hellish\nFenachrone performing their routine tasks. The next instant there was a\nflash of light extending for thousands upon untold thousands of miles in\nevery direction. That flare of light vanished as rapidly as it had\nappeared--instantaneously--and throughout the entire neighborhood of the\nplace where the Fenachrone cruiser had been, there was nothing. Not a\nplate nor a girder, not a fragment, not the most minute particle nor\ndroplet of disrupted metal nor of condensed vapor. So terrific, so\nincredibly and incomprehensibly vast were the forces liberated by that\nmass of copper in its instantaneous decomposition, that every atom of\nsubstance in that great vessel had gone with the power-bar--had been\nresolved into radiations which would at some distant time and in some\nfar-off solitude unite with other radiations, again to form matter, and\nthus obey Nature's immutable cyclic law.\n\nThus vessel after vessel was destroyed of that haughty fleet which until\nnow had never suffered a reverse and a little green light in the\ngalactic model winked out and flashed back in rosy pink as each menace\nwas removed. In a few hours the space surrounding the system of the\nFenachrone was clear; then progress slackened as it became harder and\nharder to locate each vessel as the distance between it and its torpedo\nincreased. Time after time Seaton would stab forward with his detector\nscreen extended to its utmost possible spread, upon the most carefully\nplotted prolongation of the line of the torpedo's flight, only to have\nthe projection flash far beyond the vessel's furthest possible position\nwithout a reaction from the far-flung screen. Then he would go back to\nthe torpedo, make a minute alteration in his line, and again flash\nforward, only to miss it again. Finally, after thirty fruitless attempts\nto bring his detector screen into contact with the nearest Fenachrone\nship, he gave up the attempt, rammed his battered, reeking briar full of\nthe rank blend that was his favorite smoke, and strode up and down the\nfloor of the projector base--his eyes unseeing, his hands jammed deep\ninto his pockets, his jaw thrust forward, clamped upon the stem of his\npipe, emitting dense, blue clouds of strangling vapor.\n\n\"The maestro is thinking, I perceive,\" remarked Dorothy, sweetly,\nentering the projector from an airboat. \"You must all be blind, I\nguess--you no hear the bell blow, what? I've come after you--it's time\nto eat!\"\n\n\"'At-a-girl, Dot--never miss the eats! Thanks,\" and Seaton put his\nproblem away, with perceptible effort.\n\n\"This is going to be a job, Mart,\" he went back to it as soon as they\nwere seated in the airboat, flying toward \"home.\" \"I can nail them, with\nan increasing shift in azimuth, up to about thirty thousand light-years,\nbut after that it gets awfully hard to get the right shift, and up\naround a hundred thousand it seems to be darn near impossible--gets to\nbe pure guesswork. It can't be the controls, because they can hold a\npoint rigidly at five hundred thousand. Of course, we've got a pretty\nshort back-line to sight on, but the shift is more than a hundred times\nas great as the possible error in backsight could account for, and\nthere's apparently nothing either regular or systematic about it that I\ncan figure out. But.... I don't know.... Space is curved in the fourth\ndimension, of course.... I wonder if ... hm--m--m.\" He fell silent and\nCrane made a rapid signal to Dorothy, who was opening her mouth to say\nsomething. She shut it, feeling ridiculous, and nothing was said until\nthey had disembarked at their destination.\n\n\"Did you solve the puzzle, Dickie?\"\n\n\"Don't think so--got myself in deeper than ever, I'm afraid,\" he\nanswered, then went on, thinking aloud rather than addressing any one in\nparticular:\n\n\"Space is curved in the fourth dimension, and fifth-order rays, with\ntheir velocity, may not follow the same path in that dimension that\nlight does--in fact, they do not. If that path is to be plotted it\nrequires the solution of five simultaneous equations, each complete and\ngeneral, and each of the fifth degree, and also an exponential series\nwith the unknown in the final exponent, before the fourth-dimensional\nconcept can be derived ... hm--m--m. No use--we've struck something that\nnot even Norlaminian theory can handle.\"\n\n\"You surprise me.\" Crane said. \"I supposed that they had everything\nworked out.\"\n\n\"Not on fifth-order stuff--it's new, you know. It begins to look as\nthough we'd have to stick around until every one of those torpedoes gets\nsomewhere near its mother-ship. Hate to do it, too--it'll take six\nmonths, at least, to reach the vessels clear across the Galaxy. I'll put\nit up to the gang at dinner--guess they'll let me talk business a couple\nof minutes overtime, especially after they find out what I've got to\nsay.\"\n\nHe explained the phenomenon to an interested group of white-bearded\nscientists as they ate. Rovol, to Seaton's surprise, was elated and\nenthusiastic.\n\n\"Wonderful, my boy!\" he breathed. \"Marvelous! A perfect subject for\nyears after year of deepest study and the most profound thought.\nPerfect!\"\n\n\"But what can we _do_ about it?\" asked Seaton, exasperated. \"We don't\nwant to hang around here twiddling our thumbs for a year waiting for\nthose torpedoes to get to wherever they're going!\"\n\n\"We can do nothing but wait and study. That problem is one of splendid\ndifficulty, as you yourself realize. Its solution may well be a matter\nof lifetimes instead of years. But what is a year, more or less? You can\ndestroy the Fenachrone eventually, so be content.\"\n\n\"But content is just exactly what I'm _not_!\" declared Seaton,\nemphatically. \"I want to do it, and do it _now_!\"\n\n\"Perhaps I might volunteer a suggestion,\" said Caslor, diffidently; and\nas both Rovol and Seaton looked at him in surprise he went on: \"Do not\nmisunderstand me. I do not mean concerning the mathematical problem in\ndiscussion, about which I am entirely ignorant. But has it occurred to\nyou that those torpedoes are not intelligent entities, acting upon their\nown volition and steering themselves as a result of their own ordered\nmental processes? No, they are mechanisms, in my own province, and I\nventure to say with the utmost confidence that they are guided to their\ndestinations by streamers of force of some nature, emanating from the\nvessels upon whose tracks they are.\"\n\n\"'Nobody Holme' is right!\" exclaimed Seaton, tapping his temple with an\nadmonitory forefinger. \"'Sright, ace--I thought maybe I'd quit using my\nhead for nothing but a hatrack now, but I guess that's all it's good\nfor, yet. Thanks a lot for the idea--that gives me something I can get\nmy teeth into, and now that Rovol's got a problem to work on for the\nnext century or so, everybody's happy.\"\n\n\"How does that help matters?\" asked Crane in wonder. \"Of course it is\nnot surprising that no lines of force were visible, but I thought that\nyour detectors screens would have found them if any such guiding beams\nhad been present.\"\n\n\"The ordinary bands, if of sufficient power, yes. But there are many\npossible tracer rays not reactive to a screen such as I was using. It\nwas very light and weak, designed for terrific velocity and for\ninstantaneous automatic arrest when in contact with the enormous\nforces of a power bar. It wouldn't react at all to the minute energy\nof the kind of beams they'd be most likely to use for that work.\nCaslor's certainly right. They're steering their torpedoes with tracer\nrays of almost infinitesimal power, amplified in the torpedoes\nthemselves--that's the way I'd do it myself. It may take a little while\nto rig up the apparatus, but we'll get it--and then we'll run those\nbirds ragged--so fast that their ankles'll catch fire--and won't need\nthe fourth-dimensional correction after all.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen the bell announced the beginning of the following period of labor,\nSeaton and his co-workers were in the Area of Experiment waiting, and\nthe work was soon under way.\n\n\"How are you going about this, Dick?\" asked Crane.\n\n\"Going to examine the nose of one of those torpedoes first, and see what\nit actually works on. Then build me a tracer detector that'll pick it up\nat high velocity. Beats the band, doesn't it, that neither Rovol nor I,\nwho should have thought of it first, ever did see anything as plain as\nthat? That those things are following a ray?\"\n\n\"That is easily explained, and is no more than natural. Both of you were\nnot only devoting all your thoughts to the curvature of space, but were\nalso too close to the problem--like the man in the woods, who cannot see\nthe forest because of the trees.\"\n\n\"Yeah, may be something in that, too. Plain enough, when Caslor showed\nit to us,\" said Seaton.\n\nWhile he was talking, Seaton had projected himself into the torpedo he\nhad lined up so many times the previous day. With the automatic motions\nset to hold him stationary in the tiny instrument compartment of the\ncraft, now traveling at a velocity many times that of light, he set to\nwork. A glance located the detector mechanism, a set of short-wave coils\nand amplifiers, and a brief study made plain to him the principles\nunderlying the directional loop finders and the controls which guided\nthe flying shell along the path of the tracer ray. He then built a\ndetector structure of pure force immediately in front of the torpedo,\nand varied the frequency of his own apparatus until a meter upon one of\nthe panels before his eyes informed him that his detector was in perfect\nresonance with the frequency of the tracer ray. He then moved ahead of\nthe torpedo, along the guiding ray.\n\n\"Guiding it, eh?\" Dunark congratulated him.\n\n\"Kinda. My directors out there aren't quite so hot, though. I'm a trifle\nshy on control somewhere, so much so that if I put on anywhere near full\nvelocity, I lose the ray. Think I can clear that up with a little\nexperimenting, though.\"\n\nHe fingered controls lightly, depressed a few more keys, and set one\nvernier, already at a ratio of a million to one, down to ten million. He\nthen stepped up his velocity, and found that the guides worked well up\nto a speed much greater than any ever reached by Fenachrone vessels or\ntorpedoes, but failed utterly to hold the ray at anything approaching\nthe full velocity possible to his fifth-order projector. After hours and\ndays of work and study--in the course of which hundreds of the\nFenachrone vessels were destroyed--after employing all the resources of\nhis mind, now stored with the knowledge of rays accumulated by hundreds\nof generations of highly-trained research specialists in rays, he became\nconvinced that it was an inherent impossibility to trace any ether wave\nwith the velocity he desired.\n\n\"Can't be done, I guess, Mart,\" he confessed, ruefully. \"You see, it\nworks fine up to a certain point; but beyond that, nothing doing. I've\njust found out why--and in so doing, I think I've made a contribution\nto science. At velocities well below that of light, light-waves are\nshifted a minute amount, you know. At the velocity of light, and up\nto a velocity not even approached by the Fenachrone vessels on their\nlongest trips, the distortion is still not serious--no matter how fast\nwe want to travel in the _Skylark_, I think I can guarantee that we\nwill still be able to see things. That is to be expected from the\ngenerally-accepted idea that the apparent velocity of any ether\nvibration is independent of the velocity of either source or receiver.\nHowever, that relationship fails at velocities far below that of\nfifth-order rays. At only a very small fraction of that speed the\ntracers I am following are so badly distorted that they disappear\naltogether, and I have to distort them backwards. That wouldn't be too\nbad, but when I get up to about one per cent of the velocity I want to\nuse, I can't calculate a force that will operate to distort them back\ninto recognizable wave-forms. That's another problem for Rovol to chew\non, for another hundred years.\"\n\n\"That will, of course, slow up the work of clearing the Galaxy of the\nFenachrone, but at the same time I see nothing about which to be\nalarmed,\" Crane replied. \"You are working very much faster than you\ncould have done by waiting for the torpedoes to arrive. The present\ncondition is very satisfactory, I should say,\" and he waved his hand at\nthe galactic model, in nearly three-fourths of whose volume the green\nlights had been replaced by pink ones.\n\n\"Yeah, pretty fair as far as that goes--we'll clean up in ten days or\nso--but I hate to be licked. Well, I might as well quit sobbing and get\nbusy!\"\n\nIn due time the nine hundred and sixth Fenachrone vessel was checked off\non the model, and the two Terrestrials went in search of Drasnik, whom\nthey found in his study, summing up and analyzing a mass of data, facts,\nand ideas which were being projected in the air around him.\n\n\"Well, our first job's done,\" Seaton stated. \"What do you know that you\nfeel like passing around?\"\n\n\"My investigation is practically complete,\" replied the First of\nPsychology, gravely. \"I have explored many Fenachrone minds, and without\nexception I have found them chambers of horror of a kind unimaginable to\none of us. However, you are not interested in their psychology, but in\nfacts bearing upon your problem. While such facts were scarce, I did\ndiscover a few interesting items. I spied upon them in public and in\ntheir most private haunts. I analyzed them individually and\ncollectively, and from the few known facts and from the great deal of\nguesswork and conjecture there available to me, I have formulated a\ntheory. I shall first give you the known facts. Their scientists cannot\ndirect nor control any ray not propagated through ether, but they can\ndetect one such frequency or band of frequencies which they call\n'infra-rays' and which are probably the fifth-order rays, since they lie\nin the first level below the ether. The detector proper is a type of\nlamp, which gives a blue light at the ordinary intensity of such rays as\nwould come from space or from an ordinary power plant, but gives a red\nlight under strong excitation.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh, I get that O. K.,\" said Seaton. \"Rovol's\ngreat-great-great-grandfather had 'em--I know all about 'em,\" Seaton\nencouraged Drasnik, who had paused, with a questioning glance. \"I know\nexactly how and why such a detector works. We gave 'em an alarm, all\nright. Even though we were working on a tight beam from here to there,\nour secondary projector there was radiating enough to affect every such\ndetector within a thousand miles.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDrasnik continued: \"Another significant fact is that a great many\npersons--I learned of some five hundred, and there were probably many\nmore--have disappeared without explanation and without leaving a trace;\nand it seems that they disappeared very shortly after our communication\nwas delivered. One of these was Fenor, the Emperor. His family remain,\nhowever, and his son is not only ruling in his stead, but is carrying\nout his father's policies. The other disappearances are all alike and\nare peculiar in certain respects. First, every man who vanished belonged\nto the Party of Postponement--the minority party of the Fenachrone, who\nbelieve that the time for the Conquest has not yet come. Second, every\none of them was a leader in thought in some field of usefulness, and\nevery such field is represented by at least one disappearance--even the\narmy, as General Fenimol, the Commander-in-Chief, and his whole family,\nare among the absentees. Third, and most remarkable, each such\ndisappearance included an entire family, clear down to children and\ngrand-children, however young. Another fact is that the Fenachrone\nDepartment of Navigation keeps a very close check upon all vessels,\nparticularly vessels capable of navigating outer space. Every vessel\nbuilt must be registered, and its location is always known from its\nindividual tracer ray. No Fenachrone vessel is missing.\"\n\n\"I also sifted a mass of gossip and conjecture, some of which may bear\nupon the subject. One belief is that all the persons were put to death\nby Fenor's secret service, and that the Emperor was assassinated in\nrevenge. The most widespread belief, however, is that they have fled.\nSome hold that they are in hiding in some remote shelter in the jungle,\narguing that the rigid registration of all vessels renders a journey of\nany great length impossible and that the detector screens would have\ngiven warning of any vessel leaving the planet. Others think that\npersons as powerful as Fenimol and Ravindau could have built any vessel\nthey chose with neither the knowledge nor consent of the Department of\nNavigation, or that they could have stolen a Navy vessel, destroying its\nrecords; and that Ravindau certainly could have so neutralized the\nscreens that they would have given no alarm. These believe that the\nabsent ones have migrated to some other solar system or to some other\nplanet of the same sun. One old general loudly gave it as his opinion\nthat the cowardly traitors had probably fled clear out of the Galaxy,\nand that it would be a good thing to send the rest of the Party of\nPostponement after them. There, in brief, are the salient points of my\ninvestigation in so far as it concerns your immediate problem.\"\n\n\"A good many straws pointing this way and that,\" commented Seaton.\n\"However, we know that the 'postponers' are just as rabid on the idea of\nconquering the Universe as the others are--only they are a lot more\ncautious and won't take even a gambler's chance of a defeat. But you've\nformed a theory--what is it, Drasnik?\"\n\n\"From my analysis of these facts and conjectures, in conjunction with\ncertain purely psychological indices which we need not take time to go\ninto now, I am certain that they have left their solar system, probably\nin an immense vessel built a long time ago and held in readiness for\njust such an emergency. I am not certain of their destination, but it is\nmy opinion that they have left this Galaxy, and are planning upon\nstarting anew upon some suitable planet in some other Galaxy, from\nwhich, at some future date, the Conquest of the Universe shall proceed\nas it was originally planned.\"\n\n\"Great balls of fire!\" blurted Seaton. \"They couldn't--not in a million\nyears!\" He thought a moment, then continued more slowly: \"But they\ncould--and, with their dispositions, they probably would. You're one\nhundred per cent. right, Drasnik. We've got a real job of hunting on our\nhands now. So-long, and thanks a lot.\"\n\nBack in the projector Seaton prowled about in brown abstraction, his\nvillainous pipe poisoning the circumambient air, while Crane sat, quiet\nand self-possessed as always, waiting for the nimble brain of his friend\nto find a way over, around, or through the obstacle confronting them.\n\n\"Got it, Mart!\" Seaton yelled, darting to the board and setting up one\nintegral after another. \"If they did leave the planet in a ship, we'll\nbe able to watch them go--and we'll see what they did, anyway, no matter\nwhat it was!\"\n\n\"How? They've been gone almost a month already,\" protested Crane.\n\n\"We know within half an hour the exact time of their departure. We'll\nsimply go out the distance light has traveled since that time, gather in\nthe rays given off, amplify them a few billion times, and take a look at\nwhatever went on.\"\n\n\"But we have no idea of what region of the planet to study, or whether\nit was night or day at the point of departure when they left.\"\n\n\"We'll get the council room, and trace events from there. Day or night\nmakes no difference--we'll have to use infra-red anyway, because of the\nfog, and that's almost as good at night as in the daytime. There is no\nsuch thing as absolute darkness upon any planet, anyway, and we've got\npower enough to make anything visible that happened there, night or day.\nMart, I've got power enough here to see and to photograph the actual\nconstruction of the pyramids of Egypt in that same way--and they were\nbuilt thousands of years ago!\"\n\n\"Heavens, what astounding possibilities!\" breathed Crane. \"Why, you\ncould....\"\n\n\"Yeah, I could do a lot of things,\" Seaton interrupted him rudely, \"but\nright now we've got other fish to fry. I've just got the city we\nvisited, at about the time we were there. General Fenimol, who\ndisappeared, must be in the council room down here right now. I'll\nretard our projection, so that time will apparently pass more quickly,\nand we'll duck down there and see what actually did happen. I can\nheterodyne, combine, and recombine just as though we were watching the\nactual scene--it's more complicated, of course, since I have to follow\nit and amplify it too, but it works out all right.\"\n\n\"This is unbelievable, Dick. Think of actually seeing something that\nreally happened in the past!\"\n\n\"Yeah, it's kinda strong, all right. As Dot would say, it's just too\nperfectly darn outrageous. But we're doing it, ain't we? I know just\nhow, and why. When we get some time I'll shoot the method into your\nbrain. Well, here we are!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPeering into the visiplates, the two men were poised above the immense\ncentral cone of the capital city of the Fenachrone. Viewing with\ninfra-red light as they were, the fog presented no obstacle and the\nindescribable beauty of the city of concentric rings and the wonderfully\nluxuriant jungle growth were clearly visible. They plunged down into the\ncouncil chamber, and saw Fenor, Ravindau, and Fenimol deep in\nconversation.\n\n\"With all the other feats of skill and sorcery you have accomplished,\nwhy don't you reconstruct their speech, also?\" asked Crane, with a\nchallenging glance.\n\n\"Well, old Doubting Thomas, it might not be absolutely impossible, at\nthat. It would mean two projectors, however, due to the difference in\nspeed of sound-waves and light-waves. Theoretically, sound-waves also\nextend to an infinite distance, but I don't believe that any possible\ndetector and amplifier could reconstruct a voice more than an hour or so\nafter it had spoken. It might, though--we'll have to try it some time,\nand see. You're fairly good at lip-reading, as I remember it. Get as\nmuch of it as you can, will you?\"\n\nAs though they were watching the scene itself as it happened--which, in\na sense, they were--they saw everything that had occurred. They saw\nFenor die, saw the general's family board the airboat, saw the orderly\nembarkation of Ravindau's organization. Finally they saw the stupendous\ntake-off of the first inter-galactic cruiser, and with that take-off,\nSeaton went into action. Faster and faster he drove that fifth-order\nbeam along the track of the fugitive, until a speed was attained beyond\nwhich his detecting converters could not hold the ether-rays they were\nfollowing. For many minutes Seaton stared intently into the visiplate,\nplotting lines and calculating forces, then he swung around to Crane.\n\n\"Well, Mart, noble old bean, solving the disappearances was easier than\nI thought it would be; but the situation as regards wiping out the last\nof the Fenachrone is getting no better, fast.\"\n\n\"I glean from the instruments that they are heading straight out into\nspace away from the Galaxy, and I assume that they are using their\nutmost acceleration?\"\n\n\"I'll say they're traveling! They're out in absolute space, you know,\nwith nothing in the way and with no intention of reversing their power\nor slowing down--they must've had absolute top acceleration on every\nminute since they left. Anyway, they're so far out already that I\ncouldn't hold even a detector on them, let alone a force that I can\ncontrol. Well, let's snap into it, fellow--on our way!\"\n\n\"Just a minute, Dick. Take it easy, what are your plans?\"\n\n\"Plans! Why worry about plans? Blow up that planet before any more of\n'em get away, and then chase that boat clear to Andromeda, if necessary.\nLet's go!\"\n\n\"Calm down and be reasonable--you are getting hysterical again. They\nhave a maximum acceleration of five times the velocity of light. So have\nwe, exactly, since we adopted their own drive. Now if our acceleration\nis the same as theirs, and they have a month's start, how long will it\ntake us to catch them?\"\n\n\"Right again. Mart--I sure was going off half-cocked again,\" Seaton\nconceded ruefully, after a moment's thought. \"They'd always be going a\nmillion or so times as fast as we would be, and getting further ahead of\nus in geometrical ratio. What's your idea?\"\n\n\"I agree with you that the time has come to destroy the planet of\nFenachrone. As for pursuing that vessel through intergalactic space,\nthat is your problem. You must figure out some method of increasing our\nacceleration. Highly efficient as is this system of propulsion, it seems\nto me that the knowledge of the Norlaminians should be able to improve\nit in some detail. Even a slight increase in acceleration would enable\nus to overtake them eventually.\"\n\n\"Hm--m--m.\" Seaton, no longer impetuous, was thinking deeply. \"How far\nare we apt to have to go?\"\n\n\"Until we get close enough to them to use your rays--say half a million\nlight-years.\"\n\n\"But surely they'll stop, some time?\"\n\n\"Of course, but not necessarily for many years. They are powered and\nprovisioned for a hundred years, you remember, and are going to 'a\ndistant galaxy.' Such a one as Ravindau would not have specified a\n_distant_ Galaxy idly, and the very closest Galaxies are so far away\nthat even the Fenachrone astronomers, with their reflecting mirrors five\nmiles in diameter, could form only the very roughest approximations of\nthe true distances.\"\n\n\"Our astronomers are all wet in their guesses, then?\"\n\n\"Their estimates are, without exception, far below the true values. They\nare not even of the correct order of magnitude.'\"\n\n\"Well, then, let's mop up on that planet. Then we'll go places and do\nthings.\"\n\nSeaton had already located the magazines in which the power bars of the\nFenachrone war-vessels were stored, and it was a short task to erect a\nsecondary projector of force in the Fenachrone atmosphere. Working out\nof that projector, beams of force seized one of the immense cylinders of\nplated copper and at Seaton's direction transported it rapidly to one of\nthe poles of the planet, where electrodes of force were clamped upon it.\nIn a similar fashion seventeen more of the frightful bombs were placed,\nequidistant over the surface of the world of the Fenachrone, so that\nwhen they were simultaneously exploded, the downward forces would be\ncertain to meet sufficient resistance to assure complete demolition of\nthe entire globe. Everything in readiness, Seaton's hand went to the\nplunger switch and closed upon it. Then, his face white and wet, he\ndropped his hand.\n\n\"No use, Mart--I can't do it. It pulls my cork. I know darn well you\ncan't either--I'll yell for help.\"\n\n\"Have you got it on the infra-red?\" asked Dunark calmly, as he shot up\ninto the projector in reply to Seaton's call. \"I want to see this, all\nof it.\"\n\n\"It's on--you're welcome to it,\" and, as the Terrestrials turned away,\nthe whole projector base was illuminated by a flare of intense, though\nsubdued light. For several minutes Dunark stared into the visiplate,\nsavage satisfaction in every line of his fierce green face as he\nsurveyed the havoc wrought by those eighteen enormous charges of\nincredible explosive.\n\n\"A nice job of clean-up, Dick,\" the Osnomian prince reported, turning\naway from the visiplate. \"It made a sun of it--the original sun is now\nquite a splendid double star. Everything was volatized, clear out, far\nbeyond their outermost screen.\"\n\n\"It had to be done, of course--it was either them or else all the rest\nof the Universe,\" Season said, jerkily. \"However, even that fact doesn't\nmake it go down easy. Well, we're done with this projector. From now on\nit's strictly up to us and _Skylark Three_. Let's beat it over there and\nsee if they've got her done yet--they were due to finish up today, you\nknow.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a silent group who embarked in the little airboat. Half way to\ntheir destination, however, Seaton came out of his blue mood with a\nyell.\n\n\"Mart, I've got it! We can give the _Lark_ a lot more acceleration than\nthey are getting--and won't need the assistance of all the minds of\nNorlamin, either.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"By using one of the very heavy metals for fuel. The intensity of the\npower liberated is a function of atomic weight, or atomic number, and\ndensity; but the fact of liberation depends upon atomic configuration--a\nfact which you and I figured out long ago. However, our figuring didn't\ngo far enough--it couldn't: we didn't know anything then. Copper happens\nto be the most efficient of the few metals which can be decomposed at\nall under ordinary excitation--that is, by using an ordinary coil, such\nas we and the Fenachrone both use. But by using special exciters,\nsending out all the orders of rays necessary to initiate the disruptive\nprocesses, we can use any metal we want to. Osnome has unlimited\nquantities of the heaviest metals, including radium and uranium. Of\ncourse we can't use radium and live--but we can and will use uranium,\nand that will give us something like four times the acceleration\npossible with copper. Dunark, what say you snap over there and smelt us\na cubic mile of uranium? No--hold it--I'll put a flock of forces on the\njob. They'll do it quicker, and I'll make 'em deliver the goods. They'll\ndeliver 'em fast, too, believe us--we'll see to that with a ten-ton bar.\nThe uranium bars'll be ready to load tomorrow, and we'll have enough\npower to chase those birds all the rest of our lives!\"\n\nReturning to the projector, Seaton actuated the complex system of forces\nrequired for the smelting and transportation of the enormous amount of\nmetal necessary, and as the three men again boarded their aerial\nconveyance, the power-bar in the projector behind them flared into\nviolet incandescence under the load already put upon it by the new\nuranium mine in distant Osnome.\n\nThe _Skylark_ lay stretched out over two miles of country, exactly as\nthey had last seen her, but now, instead of being water-white, the\nten-thousand-foot cruiser of the void was one jointless, seamless\nstructure of sparkling, transparent, purple inoson. Entering one of the\nopen doors, they stepped into an elevator and were whisked upward into\nthe control room, in which a dozen of the aged, white-bearded students\nof Norlamin were grouped about a banked and tiered mass of keyboards,\nwhich Seaton knew must be the operating mechanism of the extraordinarily\ncomplete fifth-order projector he had been promised.\n\n\"Ah, youngsters, you are just in time. Everything is complete and we are\njust about to begin loading.\"\n\n\"Sorry, Rovol, but we'll have to make a couple of changes--have to\nrebuild the exciter or build another one,\" and Seaton rapidly related\nwhat they had learned, and what they had decided to do.\n\n\"Of course, uranium is a much more efficient source of power,\" agreed\nRovol, \"and you are to be congratulated for thinking of it. It perhaps\nwould not have occurred to one of us, since the heavy metals of that\nhighly efficient group are very rare here. Building a new exciter for\nuranium is a simple task, and the converters for the corona-loss will,\nof course, require no change, since their action depends only upon the\nfrequency of the emitted losses, not upon their magnitude.\"\n\n\"Hadn't you suspected that some of the Fenachrone might be going to lead\nus a life-long chase?\" asked Dunark curiously.\n\n\"We have not given the matter a thought, my son,\" the Chief of the Five\nmade answer. \"As your years increase, you will learn not to anticipate\ntrouble and worry. Had we thought and worried over the matter before the\ntime had arrived, you will note that it would have been pain wasted, for\nour young friend Seaton has avoided that difficulty in a truly scholarly\nfashion.\"\n\n\"All set, then, Rovol?\" asked Seaton, when the forces flying from the\nprojector had built the compound exciter which would make possible the\ndisruption of the atoms of uranium. \"The metal, enough of it to fill all\nthe spare space in the hull, will be here tomorrow. You might give Crane\nand me the method of operating this projector, which I see is vastly\nmore complex even than the one in the Area of Experiment.\"\n\n\"It is the most complete thing ever seen upon Norlamin,\" replied Rovol\nwith a smile. \"Each of us installed everything in it that he could\nconceive of ever being of the slightest use, and since our combined\nknowledge covers a large field, the projector is accordingly quite\ncomprehensive.\"\n\nMultiple headsets were donned, and from each of the Norlaminian brains\nthere poured into the minds of the two Terrestrials a complete and\nminute knowledge of every possible application of the stupendous\nforce-control banked in all its massed intricacy before them.\n\n\"Well, that's some outfit!\" exulted Seaton in pleased astonishment as\nthe instructions were concluded. \"It can do anything but lay an egg--and\nI'm not a darn bit sure that we couldn't make it do that! Well, let's\ncall the girls and show them around this thing that's going to be their\nhome for quite a while.\"\n\nWhile they were waiting, Dunark led Seaton aside.\n\n\"Dick, will you need me on this trip?\" he asked. \"Of course I knew there\nwas something on your mind when you didn't send me home when you let\nUrvan, Carfon and the others go back.\"\n\n\"No, we're going it alone--unless you want to come along. I did want you\nto stick around until I got to a good chance to talk to you alone--now\nwill be a good a time as any. You and I have traded brains, and besides,\nwe've been through quite a lot of grief together, here and there--I want\nto apologize to you for not passing along to you all this stuff I've\nbeen getting here. In fact, I really wish I didn't have to have it\nmyself. Get me?\"\n\n\"Got you? I'm 'way ahead of you! Don't want it, not any part of\nit--that's why I've stayed away from any chance of learning any of it,\nand the one reason why I am going back home instead of going with you. I\nhave just brains enough to realize that neither I nor any other man of\nmy race should have it. By the time we grow up to it naturally we shall\nbe able to handle it, but not until then.\"\n\nThe two brain brothers grasped hands strongly, and Dunark continued in a\nlighter vein: \"It takes all kinds of people to make a world, you\nknow--and all kinds of races, except the Fenachrone, to make a Universe.\nWith Mardonale gone, the evolution of Osnome shall progress rapidly, and\nwhile we may not reach the Ultimate Goal, I have learned enough from you\nalready to speed up our progress considerably.\"\n\n\"Well, that's that. Had to get it off my chest, although I knew you'd\nget the idea all right. Here are the girls--Sitar too. We'll show 'em\naround.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSeaton's first thought was for the very brain of the ship--the precious\nlens of neutronium in its thin envelope of the eternal jewel--without\nwhich the beam of fifth-order rays could not be directed. He found it a\nquarter of a mile back from the needle-sharp prow, exactly in the\nlongitudinal axis of the hull, protected from any possible damage by\nbulkhead after massive bulkhead of impregnable inoson. Satisfied upon\nthat point, he went in search of the others, who were exploring their\nvast new space-ship.\n\nHuge as she was, there was no waste space--her design was as compact as\nthat of a fine radio set. The living quarters were grouped closely about\nthe central compartment, which housed the power plants, the many ray\ngenerators and projectors, and the myriads of controls of the marvelous\nmechanism for the projection and direction of fifth-order rays. Several\nlarge compartments were devoted to the machinery which automatically\nserviced the vessel--refrigerators, heaters, generators and purifiers\nfor water and air, and the numberless other mechanisms which would make\nthe cruiser a comfortable and secure home, as well as an invincible\nbattleship, in the heatless, lightless, airless, matterless waste of\nillimitable, inter-galactic space. Many compartments were for the\nstorage of food-supplies, and these were even then being filled by\nforces under the able direction of the first of Chemistry.\n\n\"All the comforts of home, even to the labels,\" Seaton grinned, as he\nread \"Dole No. 1\" upon cans of pineapple which had never been within\nthousands of light-years of the Hawaiian Islands, and saw quarter after\nquarter of fresh meat going into the freezer room from a planet upon\nwhich no animal other than man had existed for many thousands of years.\nNearly all of the remaining millions of cubic feet of space were for the\nstorage of uranium for power, a few rooms already having been filled\nwith ingot inoson for repairs. Between the many bulkheads that divided\nthe ship into numberless airtight sections, and between the many\nconcentric skins of purple metal that rendered the vessel space-worthy\nand sound, even though slabs many feet thick were to be shown off in any\ndirection--in every nook and cranny could be stored the metal to keep\nthose voracious generators full-fed, no matter how long or how severe\nthe demand for power. Every room was connected through a series of\ntubular tunnels, along which force-propelled cars or elevators slid\nsmoothly--tubes whose walls fell together into air-tight seals at any\npoint, in case of a rupture.\n\nAs they made their way back to the great control-room room of the\nvessel, they saw something that because of its small size and clear\ntransparency they had not previously seen. Below that room, not too near\nthe outer skin, in a specially-built spherical launching space, there\nwas _Skylark Two_, completely equipped and ready for an interstellar\njourney on her own account!\n\n\"Why, hello, little stranger!\" Margaret called. \"Rovol, that was a kind\nthought on your part. Home wouldn't quite be home without our old\n_Skylark_, would it, Martin?\"\n\n\"A practical thought, as well as a kind one,\" Crane responded. \"We\nundoubtedly will have occasion to visit places altogether too small for\nthe really enormous bulk of this vessel.\"\n\n\"Yes, and whoever heard of a sea-going ship without a small boat?\" put\nin irrepressible Dorothy. \"She's just too perfectly kippy for words,\nsitting up there, isn't she?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nThe Extra-Galactic Duel\n\n\nLoaded until her outer skin almost bulged with tightly packed bars of\nuranium and equipped to meet any emergency of which the combined efforts\nof the mightiest intellects of Norlamin could foresee even the slightest\npossibility, _Skylark Three_ lay quiescent. Quiescent, but surcharged\nwith power, she seemed to Seaton's tense mind to share his own eagerness\nto be off; seemed to be motionlessly straining at her neutral controls\nin a futile endeavor to leave that unnatural and unpleasant environment\nof atmosphere and of material substance, to soar outward into absolute\nzero of temperature and pressure, into the pure and undefiled ether\nwhich was her natural and familiar medium.\n\nThe five human beings were grouped near an open door of their cruiser;\nbefore them were the ancient scientists, who for so many days had been\nlaboring with them in their attempt to crush the monstrous race which\nwas threatening the Universe. With the elders were the Terrestrials'\nmany friends from the Country of Youth, and surrounding the immense\nvessel in a throng covering an area to be measured only in square miles\nwere massed myriads of Norlaminians. From their tasks everywhere had\ncome the mental laborers; the Country of Youth had been left\ndepopulated; even those who, their lifework done, had betaken themselves\nto the placid Nirvana of the Country of Age, returned briefly to the\nCountry of Study to speed upon its way that stupendous Ship of Peace.\n\nThe majestic Fodan, Chief of the Five, was concluding his address:\n\n\"And may the Unknowable Force direct your minor forces to a successful\nconclusion of your task. If, upon the other hand, it should by some\nunforeseen chance be graven upon the Sphere that you are to pass in this\nsupreme venture, you may pass in all tranquillity, for the massed\nintellect of our entire race is here supporting me in my solemn\naffirmation that the Fenachrone shall not be allowed to prevail. In the\nname of all Norlamin, I bid you farewell.\"\n\n[Illustration: Very slowly at first, the unimaginable mass of the vessel\nfloated lightly upward.]\n\nCrane spoke briefly in reply and the little group of Earthly wanderers\nstepped into the elevator. As they sped upward toward the control room,\ndoor after door shot into place behind them, establishing a manifold\nseal. Seaton's hand played over the controls and the great cruiser of\nthe void tilted slowly upward until its narrow prow pointed almost\ndirectly into the zenith. Then, very slowly at first, the unimaginable\nmass of the vessel floated lightly upward, with a slowly increasing\nvelocity. Faster and faster she flew--out beyond measurable atmosphere,\nout beyond the outermost limits of the green system. Finally, in\ninterstellar space, Seaton threw out super-powered detector and\nrepelling screens, anchored himself at the driving console with a force,\nset the power control at \"molecular\" so that the propulsive force\naffected alike every molecule of the vessel and its contents, and, all\nsense of weight and acceleration lost, he threw in the plunger switch\nwhich released every iota of the theoretically possible power of the\ndriving mass of uranium.\n\nStaring intently into the visiplate, he corrected their course from time\nto time by minute fractions of a second of arc; then, satisfied at last,\nhe set the automatic forces which would guide them, temporarily out of\ntheir course, around any obstacles, such as the uncounted thousands of\nsolar systems lying in or near their path. He then removed the\nrestraining forces from his body and legs, and with a small pencil of\nforce wafted himself over to Crane and the two women.\n\n\"Well, bunch,\" he stated, matter-of-fact, \"we're on our way. We'll be\nthis way for some time, so we might as well get used to it. Any little\nthing you want to talk over?\"\n\n\"How long will it take us to catch 'em?\" asked Dorothy \"Traveling this\nway isn't half as much fun as it is when you let us have some weight to\nhold us down.\"\n\n\"Hard to tell exactly, Dottie. If we had precisely four times their\nacceleration and had started from the same place, we would of course\novertake them in just the number of days they had the start of us, since\nthe distance covered at any constant positive acceleration is\nproportional to the square of the time elapsed. However, there are\nseveral complicating factors in the actual situation. We started out not\nonly twenty-nine days behind them, but also a matter of five hundred\nthousand light-years of distance. It will take us quite a while to get\nto their starting-point. I can't tell even that very close, as we will\nprobably have to reduce this acceleration before we get out of the\nGalaxy, in order to give detectors and repellers time to act on stars\nand other loose impediments. Powerful as those screens are and fast as\nthey work, there is a limit to the velocity we can use here in this\ncrowded Galaxy. Outside it, in free space, of course we can open her up\nagain. Then, too, our acceleration is not exactly four times theirs,\nonly three point nine one eight six. On the other hand, we don't have to\ncatch them to go to work on them. We can operate very nicely at five\nthousand light-centuries. So there you are--it'll probably be somewhere\nbetween thirty-nine and forty-one days, but it may be a day or so more\nor less.\"\n\n\"How do you know they are using copper?\" asked Margaret. \"Maybe their\nscientists stored up some uranium and know how to use it.\"\n\n\"Nope, that's out like a light. First, Mart and I saw only copper bars\nin their ship. Second, copper is the most efficient metal found in\nquantity upon their planet. Third, even if they had uranium or any metal\nof its class, they couldn't use it without a complete knowledge of, and\nability to handle, the fourth and fifth orders of rays.\"\n\n\"It is your opinion, then, that destroying this last Fenachrone vessel\nis to prove as simple a matter as did the destruction of the others?\"\nCrane queried, pointedly.\n\n\"Hm-m-m. Never thought about it from that angle at all, Mart.... You're\nstill the ground-and-lofty thinker of the outfit, ain't you? Now that\nyou mention it, though, we may find that the Last of the Mohicans ain't\nentirely toothless, at that. But say, Mart, how come I'm as wild and\ncock-eyed as I ever was? Rovol's a slow and thoughtful old codger, and\nwith his accumulation of knowledge it looks like I'd be the same way.\"\n\n\"Far from it,\" Crane replied. \"Your nature and mine remain unchanged.\nTemperament is a basic trait of heredity, and is neither affected nor\nacquired by increase of knowledge. You acquired knowledge from Rovol,\nDrasnik, and others, as did I--but you are still the flashing genius and\nI am still your balance wheel. As for Fenachrone toothlessness: now that\nyou have considered it, what is your opinion?\"\n\n\"Hard to say. They didn't know how to control the fifth order rays, or\nthey wouldn't have run. They've got real brains, though, and they'll\nhave something like seventy days to work on the problem. While it\ndoesn't stand to reason that they could find out much in seventy days,\nstill they may have had a set-up of instruments on their detectors that\nwould have enabled them to analyze our fields and thus compute the\nstructure of the secondary projector we used there. If so, it wouldn't\ntake them long to find out enough to give us plenty of grief--but I\ndon't really believe that they knew enough. I don't quite know what to\nthink. They may be easy and they may not; but, easy or hard to get,\nwe're loaded for bear and I'm plenty sure that we'll pull their corks.\"\n\n\"So am I, really, but we must consider every contingency. We know that\nthey had at least a detector of fifth-order rays....\"\n\n\"And if they did have an analytical detector,\" Seaton interrupted,\n\"they'll probably slap a ray on us as soon as we stick our nose out of\nthe Galaxy!\"\n\n\"They may--and even though I do not believe that there is any\nprobability of them actually doing it, it will be well to be armed\nagainst the possibility.\"\n\n\"Right, old top--we'll do that little thing!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUneventful days passed, and true to Seaton's calculations, the awful\nacceleration with which they had started out could not be maintained. A\nfew days before the edge of the Galaxy was reached, it became necessary\nto cut off the molecular drive, and to proceed with an acceleration\nequal only to that of gravitation at the surface of the Earth. Tired of\nweightlessness and its attendant discomforts to everyday life, the\ntravelers enjoyed the interlude immensely, but it was all too short--too\nsoon the stars thinned out ahead of \"_Three's_\" needle prow. As soon as\nthe way ahead of them was clear, Seaton again put on the maximum power\nof his terrific bars and, held securely at the console, set up a long\nand involved integral. Ready to transfer the blended and assembled\nforces to a plunger, he stayed his hand, thought a moment, and turned to\nCrane.\n\n\"Want some advice, Mart. I'd thought of setting up three or four courses\nof five-ply screen on the board--a detector screen on the outside of\neach course, next to it a repeller, then a full-coverage ether-ray\nscreen, then a zone of force, and a full-coverage fifth-order ray-screen\nas a liner. Then, with them all set up on the board, but not out, throw\nout a wide detector. That detector would react upon the board at impact\nwith anything hostile, and automatically throw out the courses it found\nnecessary.\"\n\n\"That sounds like ample protection, but I am not enough of a\nray-specialist to pass an opinion. Upon what point are you doubtful?\"\n\n\"About leaving them on the board. The only trouble is that the reaction\nisn't absolutely instantaneous. Even fifth-order rays would require a\nmillionth of a second or so to set the courses. Now if they were using\nether waves, that would be lots of time to block them, but if they\n_should_ happen to have fifth-order stuff it'd get here the same time\nour own detector-impulse would, and it's just barely conceivable that\nthey might give us a nasty jolt before the defenses went out. Nope, I'm\ndeveloping a cautious streak myself now, when I take time to do it.\nWe've got lots of uranium, and I'm going to put one course out.\"\n\n\"You cannot put everything out, can you?\"\n\n\"Not quite, but pretty nearly, I'll leave a hole in the ether screen to\npass visible light--no, I won't either. You folks can see just as well,\neven on the direct-vision wall plates, with light heterodyned on the\nfifth, so we'll close all ether bands, absolutely. All we'll have to\nleave open will be the one extremely narrow band upon which our\nprojector is operating, and I'll protect that with a detector screen.\nAlso, I'm going to send out all four courses, instead of only one--then\nI'll _know_ we're all right.\"\n\n\"Suppose they find our one band, narrow as it is? Of course, if that\nwere shut off automatically by the detector, we'd be safe; but would we\nnot be out of control?\"\n\n\"Not necessarily--I see you didn't get quite all this stuff over the\neducator. The other projector worked that way, on one fixed band out of\nthe nine thousand odd possible. But this one is an ultra-projector, an\nimprovement invented at the last minute. Its carrier wave can be shifted\nat will from one band of the fifth order to any other one; and I'll bet\na hat that's _one_ thing the Fenachrone haven't got! Any other\nsuggestions?... all right, let's get busy!\"\n\nA single light, quick-acting detector was sent out ahead of four courses\nof five-ply screen, then Seaton's fingers again played over the keys,\nfabricating a detector screen so tenuous that it would react to nothing\nweaker than a copper power bar in full operation and with so nearly\nabsolute zero resistance that it could be driven at the full velocity of\nhis ultra-projector. Then, while Crane watched the instruments closely\nand while Dorothy and Margaret watched the faces of their husbands with\nonly mild interest, Seaton drove home the plunger that sent that\nprodigious and ever-widening fan ahead of them with a velocity\nunthinkable millions of times that of light. For five minutes, until\nthat far-flung screen had gone as far as it could be thrown by the\nutmost power of the uranium bar, the two men stared at the unresponsive\ninstruments, then Seaton shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"I had a hunch,\" he remarked with a grin. \"They didn't wait for us a\nsecond. 'I don't care for some,' says they, 'I've already had any.'\nThey're running in a straight line, with full power on, and don't intend\nto stop or slow down.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\" asked Dorothy. \"By the distance? How far away are\nthey?\"\n\n\"I know, Red-Top, by what I didn't find out with that screen I just put\nout. It didn't reach them, and it went so far that the distance is\nabsolutely meaningless, even expressed in parsecs. Well, a stern chase\nis proverbially a long chase, and I guess this one isn't going to be any\nexception.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEvery eight hours Seaton launched his all-embracing ultra-detector, but\nday after day passed and the instruments remained motionless after each\ncast of that gigantic net. For several days the Galaxy behind them had\nbeen dwindling from a mass of stars down to a huge bright lens; down to\na small, faint lens; down to a faintly luminous patch. At the previous\ncast of the detector it had still been visible as a barely-perceptible\npoint of light in the highest telescopic power of the visiplate. Now, as\nDorothy and Seaton, alone in the control room, stared into that\nvisiplate, everything was blank and black; sheer, indescribable\nblackness; the utter and absolute absence of everything visible or\ntangible.\n\n\"This is awful, Dick.... It's just too darn horrible. It simply scares\nme pea-green!\" she shuddered as she drew herself to him, and he swept\nboth his mighty arms around her in a soul-satisfying embrace.\n\n\"'Sall right, darling. That stuff out there'd scare anybody--I'm scared\npurple myself. It isn't in any finite mind to understand anything\ninfinite or absolute. There's one redeeming feature, though,\ncuddle-pup--we're together.\"\n\n\"You chirped it, lover!\" Dorothy returned his caresses with all her\nold-time fervor and enthusiasm. \"I feel lots better now. If it gets to\nyou that way, too, I know it's perfectly normal--I was beginning to\nthink maybe I was yellow or something ... but maybe you're kidding me?\"\nshe held him off at arm's length, looking deep into his eyes: then,\nreassured, went back-into his arms. \"Nope, you feel it, too,\" and her\nglorious auburn head found its natural resting-place in the curve of his\nmighty shoulder.\n\n\"Yellow!... You?\" Seaton pressed his wife closer still! and laughed\naloud. \"Maybe--but so is picric acid; so is nitroglycerin; and so is\npure gold.\"\n\n\"Flatterer!\" Her low, entrancing chuckle bubbled over. \"But you know I\njust revel in it. I'll kiss you for that!\"\n\n\"It _is_ awfully lonesome out here, without even a star to look at,\" she\nwent on, after a time, then laughed again. \"If the Cranes and Shiro\nweren't along, we'd be really 'alone at last,' wouldn't we?\"\n\n\"I'll say we would! But that reminds me of something. According to my\nfigures, we might have been able to detect the Fenachrone on the last\ntest, but we didn't. Think I'll try 'em again before we turn in.\"\n\nOnce more he flung out that tenuous net of force, and as it reached the\nextreme limit of its travel, the needle of the micro-ammeter flickered\nslightly, barely moving off its zero mark.\n\n\"Whee! Whoopee!\" he yelled. \"Mart, we're on 'em!\"\n\n\"Close?\" demanded Crane, hurrying into the control room upon his beam.\n\n\"Anything but. Barely touched 'em--current something less than a\nthousandth of a micro-ampere on a million to one step-up. However, it\nproves our ideas are O. K.\"\n\nThe next day--_Skylark III_ was running on Eastern Standard Time, of the\nTerrestrial United States of America--the two mathematicians covered\nsheet after sheet of paper with computations and curves. After checking\nand rechecking the figures, Seaton shut off the power, released the\nmolecular drive, and applied acceleration of twenty-nine point six oh\ntwo feet per second; and five human beings breathed as one a profound\nsigh of relief as an almost-normal force of gravitation was restored to\nthem.\n\n\"Why the let-up?\" asked Dorothy. \"They're an awful long ways off yet,\naren't they? Why not hurry up and catch them?\"\n\n\"Because we're going infinitely faster than they are now. If we kept up\nfull acceleration, we'd pass them so fast that we couldn't fight them at\nall. This way, we'll still be going a lot faster than they are when we\nget close to them, but not enough faster to keep us from maneuvering\nrelatively to their vessel, if things should go that far. Guess I'll\ntake another reading on 'em.\"\n\n\"I do not believe that I should,\" Crane suggested, thoughtfully. \"After\nall, they may have perfected their instruments, and yet may not have\ndetected that extremely light touch of our ray last night. If so, why\nput them on guard?\"\n\n\"They're probably on guard, all right, without having to be put\nthere--but it's a sound idea, anyway. Along the same line I'll release\nthe fifth-order screens, with the fastest possible detector on guard.\nWe're just about within reach of a light copper-driven ray right now,\nbut it's a cinch they can't send anything heavy this far, and if they\nthink we're overconfident, so much the better.\"\n\n\"There,\" he continued, after a few minutes at the keyboard. \"All set. If\nthey put a detector on us, I've got a force set to make a noise like a\nNew York City fire siren. If pressed, I'd reluctantly admit that in my\nopinion we're carrying caution to a point ten thousand degrees below the\nabsolute zero of sanity. I'll bet my shirt that we don't hear a yip out\nof them before we touch 'em off. Furthermore....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe rest of his sentence was lost in a crescendo bellow of sound.\nSeaton, still at the controls, shut off the noise, studied his meters\ncarefully, and turned around to Crane with a grin.\n\n\"You win the shirt, Mart. I'll give it to you next Wednesday, when my\nother one comes back from the laundry. It's a fifth-order detector ray,\ncoming in beautifully on band forty-seven fifty, right in the middle of\nthe order.\"\n\n\"Aren't you going to put a ray on 'em?\" asked Dorothy in surprise.\n\n\"Nope--what's the use? I can read theirs as well as I could one of my\nown. Maybe they know that too--if they don't we'll let 'em think we're\ncoming along, as innocent as Mary's little lamb, so I'll let their ray\nstay on us. It's too thin to carry anything, and if they thicken it up\nmuch I've got an axe set to chop it off.\" Seaton whistled a merry\nlilting refrain as his fingers played over the stops and keys.\n\n\"Why, Dick, you seem actually pleased about it.\" Margaret was plainly\nill at ease.\n\n\"Sure am. I never did like to drown baby kittens, and it kinda goes\nagainst the grain to stab a guy in the back, when he ain't even looking,\neven if he is a Fenachrone. If they can fight back some I'll get mad\nenough to blow 'em up happy.\"\n\n\"But suppose they fight back too hard?\"\n\n\"They can't--the worst that can possibly happen is that we can't lick\nthem. They certainly can't lick us, because we can outrun 'em. If we\ncan't get 'em alone, we'll beat it back to Norlamin and bring up\nre-enforcements.\"\n\n\"I am not so sure,\" Crane spoke slowly. \"There is, I believe, a\ntheoretical possibility that sixth-order rays exist. Would an extension\nof the methods of detection of fifth-order rays reveal them?\"\n\n\"_Sixth_? Sweet spirits of niter! Nobody knows anything about them.\nHowever, I've had one surprise already, so maybe your suggestion isn't\nas crazy as it sounds. We've got three or four days yet before either\nside can send anything except on the sixth, so I'll find out what I can\ndo.\"\n\nHe flew at the task, and for the next three days could hardly be torn\nfrom it for rest; but\n\n\"O. K., Mart,\" he finally announced. \"They exist, all right, and I can\ndetect 'em. Look here,\" and he pointed to a tiny receiver, upon which a\nsmall lamp flared in brilliant scarlet light.\n\n\"Are they sending them?\"\n\n\"No, fortunately. They're coming from our bar. See, it shines blue when\nI put a grounded shield between it and the bar, and stays blue when I\nattach it to their detector ray.\"\n\n\"Can you direct them?\"\n\n\"Not a chance in the world. That means a lifetime, probably many\nlifetimes, of research, unless somebody uses a fairly complete pattern\nof them close enough to this detector so that I can analyze it. 'Sa good\ndeal like calculus in that respect. It took thousands of years to get it\nin the first place, but it's easy when somebody that already knows it\nshows you how it goes.\"\n\n\"The Fenachrone learned to direct fifth-order rays so quickly, then, by\nan analysis of our fifth-order projector there?\"\n\n\"Our secondary projector, yes. They must have had some neutronium in\nstock, too--but it would have been funny if they hadn't, at\nthat--they've had intra-atomic power for ages.\"\n\nSilent and grim, he seated himself at the console, and for an hour he\nwove an intricate pattern of forces upon the inexhaustible supply of\nkeys afforded by the ultra-projector before he once touched a plunger.\n\n\"What are you doing? I followed you for a few hundred steps, but could\ngo no farther.\"\n\n\"Merely a little safety-first stuff. In case they should send any real\npattern of sixth-order rays this set-up will analyze it, record the\ncomplete analysis, throw out a screen against every frequency of the\npattern, throw on the molecular drive, and pull us back toward the\ngalaxy at full acceleration, while switching the frequency of our\ncarrier wave a thousand times a second, to keep them from shooting a hot\none through our open band. It'll do it all in about a millionth of a\nsecond, too--I want to get us all back alive if possible! Hm--m. They've\nshut off their ray--they know we've tapped onto it. Well, war's declared\nnow--we'll see what we can see.\"\n\nTransferring the assembled beam to a plunger, he sent out a secondary\nprojector toward the Fenachrone vessel, as fast as it could be driven,\nclose behind a widespread detector net. He soon found the enemy cruiser,\nbut so immense was the distance that it was impossible to hold the\nprojection anywhere in its neighborhood. They flashed beyond it and\nthrough it and upon all sides of it, but the utmost delicacy of the\ncontrols would not permit of holding even upon the immense bulk of the\nvessel, to say nothing of holding upon such a relatively tiny object as\nthe power bar. As they flashed repeatedly through the warship, they saw\npiecemeal and sketchily her formidable armament and the hundreds of men\nof her crew, each man at battle station at the controls of some\nfrightful engine of destruction. Suddenly they were cut off as a screen\nclosed behind them--the Earth-men felt an instant of unreasoning terror\nas it seemed that one-half of their peculiar dual personalities vanished\nutterly. Seaton laughed.\n\n\"That was a funny sensation, wasn't it? It just means that they've\nclimbed a tree and pulled the tree up after them.\"\n\n\"I do not like the odds, Dick,\" Crane's face was grave. \"They have many\nhundreds of men, all trained; and we are only two. Yes, only one, for I\ncount for nothing at those controls.\"\n\n\"All the better, Mart. This board more than makes up the difference.\nThey've got a lot of stuff, of course, but they haven't got anything\nlike this control system. Their captain's got to issue orders, whereas\nI've got everything right under my hands. Not so uneven as they think!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWithin battle range at last, Seaton hurled his utmost concentration of\ndirect forces, under the impact of which three courses of Fenachrone\ndefensive screen flared through the ultra-violet and went black. There\nthe massed direct attack was stopped--at what cost the enemy alone\nknew--and the Fenachrone countered instantly and in a manner totally\nunexpected. Through the narrow slit in the fifth-order screen through\nwhich Seaton was operating, in the bare one-thousandth of a second that\nit was open, so exactly synchronized and timed that the screens did not\neven glow as it went through the narrow opening, a gigantic beam of\nheterodyned force struck full upon the bow of the _Skylark_, near the\nsharply-pointed prow, and the stubborn metal instantly flared blinding\nwhite and exploded outward in puffs of incandescent gas under the awful\npower of that Titanic thrust. Through four successive skins of inoson,\nthe theoretical ultimate of possible strength, toughness, and\nresistance, that frightful beam drove before the automatically-reacting\ndetector closed the slit and the impregnable defensive screens, driven\nby their mighty uranium bars, flared into incandescent defense. Driven\nas they were, they held, and the Fenachrone, finding that particular\nattack useless, shut off their power.\n\n\"Wow! They sure have got something!\" Seaton exclaimed in unfeigned\nadmiration. \"They sure gave us a solid kick that time! We will now take\ntime out for repairs. Also, I'm going to cut our slit down to a width of\none kilocycle, if I can possibly figure out a way of working on that\nnarrow a band, and I'm going to step up our shifting speed to a hundred\nthousand. It's a good thing they built this ship of ours in a lot of\nlayers--if that'd go through the interior we would have been punctured\nfor fair. You might weld up those holes, Mart, while I see what I can do\nhere.\"\n\nThen Seaton noticed the women, white and trembling, upon a seat.\n\n\"'Smatter? Cheer up, kids, you ain't seen nothing yet. That was just a\ncouple of little preliminary love-taps, like two boxers kinda feeling\neach other out in the first ten seconds of the first round.\"\n\n\"Preliminary love-taps!\" repeated Dorothy, looking into Seaton's eyes\nand being reassured by the serene confidence she read there. \"But they\nhit us, and hurt us badly--why, there's a hole in our _Skylark_ as big\nas a house, and it goes through four or five layers!\"\n\n\"Yes, but we're not hurt a bit. They're easily fixed, and we've lost\nnothing but a few tons of inoson and uranium. We've got lots of spare\nmetal. I don't know what I did to him, any more than he knows what he\ndid to us, but I'll bet my other shirt that he knows he's been nudged!\"\n\nRepairs completed and the changes made in the method of projection,\nSeaton actuated the rapidly-shifting slit and peered through it at the\nenemy vessel. Finding their screens still up, he directed a\ncomplete-coverage attack upon them with four bars, while with the entire\nmassed power of the remaining generators concentrated into one\nfrequency, he shifted that frequency up and down the spectrum, probing,\nprobing, ever probing with that gigantic beam of intolerable\nenergy--feeling for some crack, however slight, into which he could\ninsert that searing sheet of concentrated destruction. Although much of\nthe available power of the Fenachrone was perforce devoted to repelling\nthe continuous attack of the Terrestrials, they maintained an equally\ncontinuous attack offensive, and in spite of the narrowness of the open\nslit and the rapidity with which that slit was changing from frequency\nto frequency, enough of the frightful forces came through to keep the\nultra-powered defensive screens radiating far into the violet--and, the\nutmost power of the refrigerating system proving absolutely useless\nagainst the concentrated beams being employed, mass after mass of inoson\nwas literally blown from the outer and secondary skins of the _Skylark_\nby the comparatively tiny jets of force that leaked through the\nmomentarily open slit from time to time, as exact synchronization was\naccidentally obtained.\n\nSeaton, grimly watching his instruments, glanced at Crane, who, calm but\nwatchful at his console, was repairing the damage as fast as it was\ndone.\n\n\"They're sending more stuff, Mart, and it's getting hotter to handle.\nThat means they're building more projectors. We can play that game, too.\nThey're using up their fuel reserves fast; but we're bigger than they\nare, carry more metal, and it's more efficient metal, too. Only one way\nout of it, I guess--what say we put in enough generators to smother them\ndown by brute force, no matter how much power it takes?\"\n\n\"Why don't you use some of those awful copper shells? Or aren't we close\nenough yet?\" Dorothy's low voice came clearly, so utterly silent was\nthat frightful combat.\n\n\"Close! We're still better than two hundred thousand light-years apart!\nThere may have been longer-range battles than this somewhere in the\nUniverse, but I doubt it. And as for copper, even if we could get it to\nthem, it'd be just like so many candy kisses compared to the stuff we're\nboth using. Dear girl, there are fields of force extending for thousands\nof miles from each of these vessels beside which the exact center of the\nbiggest lightning flash you ever saw would be a dead area!\"\n\nHe set up a series of integrals and, machine after machine, in a space\nleft vacant by the rapidly-vanishing store of uranium, there appeared\ninside the fourth skin of the _Skylark_ a row of gigantic generators,\neach one adding its hellish output to the already inconceivable stream\nof energy being directed at the foe. As that frightful flow increased by\nleaps and bounds, the intensity of the Fenachrone attack diminished, and\nfinally it ceased altogether as every iota of the enemy's power became\nnecessary for the maintenance of the defenses. Still greater grew the\nstream of force from the _Skylark_, and, now that the attack had ceased,\nSeaton opened the slit wider and stopped its shifting, in order still\nfurther to increase the efficiency of his terrible weapon. Face set in a\nfighting mask and eyes hard as gray iron, deeper and deeper he drove his\nnow irresistible forces. His flying fingers were upon the keys of his\nconsole; his keen and merciless eyes were in a secondary projector near\nthe now doomed ship of the Fenachrone, directing masterfully his\nterrible attack. As the output of his generators still increased, Seaton\nbegan to compress a searing hollow sphere of seething energy upon the\nfuriously-straining defensive screens of the Fenachrone. Course after\ncourse of the heaviest possible screen was sent out, driven by massed\nbatteries of copper now disintegrating at the rate of tons in every\nsecond, only to flare through the ultra-violet and to go down before\nthat dreadful, that irresistible onslaught. Finally, as the inexorable\nsphere still contracted, the utmost efforts of the defenders could not\nkeep their screens away from their own vessel, and simultaneously the\nprow and the stern of the Fenachrone cruiser was bared to that awful\nfield of force, in which no possible substance could endure for even the\nmost infinitesimal instant of time.\n\nThere was a sudden cessation of all resistance, and those Titanic\nforces, all directed inward, converged upon a point with a power behind\nwhich there was the inconceivable energy of four hundred thousand tons\nof uranium, being disintegrated at the highest possible rate, short of\ninstant disruption. In that same instant of collapse, the enormous mass\nof power-copper in the Fenachrone cruiser and the vessel's every atom,\nalike of structure and contents, also exploded into pure energy at the\ntouch of that unimaginable field of force.\n\nIn that awful moment before Seaton could shut off his power it seemed to\nhim that space itself must be obliterated by the very concentration of\nthe unknowable and incalculable forces there unleashed--must be\nswallowed up and lost in the utterly indescribable brilliance of the\nfield of radiance driven to a distance of millions upon incandescent\nmillions of miles from the place where the last representatives of the\nmonstrous civilization of the Fenachrone had made their last stand\nagainst the forces of Universal Peace.\n\n\n\n\nEpilogue\n\n\nThe three-dimensional, moving, talking, almost living picture, being\nshown simultaneously in all the viewing areas throughout the innumerable\nplanets of the Galaxy, faded out and the image of an aged, white-bearded\nNorlaminian appeared and spoke in the Galactic language.\n\n\"As is customary, the showing of this picture has opened the celebration\nof our great Galactic holiday, Civilization Day. As you all know, it\nportrays the events leading up to and making possible the formation of\nthe League of Civilization by a mere handful of planets. The League now\nembraces all of this, the First Galaxy, and is spreading rapidly\nthroughout the Universe. Varied are the physical forms and varied are\nthe mentalities of our almost innumerable races of beings, but in\nCivilization we are becoming one, since those backward people who will\nnot co-operate with us are rendered impotent to impede our progress\namong the more enlightened.\n\n\"It is peculiarly fitting that the one who has just been chosen to head\nthe Galactic Council--the first person of a race other than one of those\nof the Central System to prove himself able to wield justly the vast\npowers of that office--should be a direct descendant of two of the\nrevered persons whose deeds of olden times we have just witnessed.\n\n\"I present to you my successor as Chief of the Galactic Council, Richard\nBallinger Seaton, the fourteen hundred sixty-ninth, of Earth.\"\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nSOME REMARKS ON THE \"SKYLARK THREE\" AND ABOUT ERRORS. A COMPLIMENT TO\nDR. SMITH'S STORIES.\n\n\n_Editor_, AMAZING STORIES:\n\nDr. Smith, in his foreword to \"Skylark Three\" mentions two errors which\nhe made knowingly. I think I can recognize the astronomical one, at any\nrate.\n\nOf course, the acceleration of twice 186,000 miles per second, as used\nin escaping the field of the great \"dud\" star, as told in \"Skylark of\nSpace\" was impossible. Nothing could withstand that strain. Further, no\ngravitational field could be that intense. It would have exactly the\neffect Dr. Smith describes and allots to the zone of force in \"Skylark\nThree\"--it would make a hole in space and pull the hole in after it.\nLight would be too heavy to leave the planet. The effect on space would\nbe so great as to curve it so violently as to shut it in about it like a\nblanket. The dud would be both invisible and unapproachable.\n\nThe astronomical error? I wonder how Dr. Smith solved the problem of\nthree--or more--bodies? Osnome is a planet of a sun in a group of\nseventeen suns, is it not? The gravitational field about even two suns\nis so exceedingly complex that a planet could take up an orbit only\nsuch that one sun was at each of the two foci of the ellipse of its\norbit, and then only provided the suns were of very nearly the same\nmass, and stationary, which in turn means they must have _no_ attraction\nfor each other. No, I think his complex system of seventeen suns would\nnot be so good for planets. Celestial Mechanics won't let them stay\nthere. And I really don't see why it was necessary to have so complex a\nsystem.\n\nFurther, I wonder if Dr. Smith considered the proposition of his ammonia\ncooling plant carefully? The ammonia \"cooling\" plant works only to\n_transmit_ heat, not to remove it. The heat is removed by it from the\ninside of an icebox for instance, and put outside, which is what is\nwanted. However, it must have some place to dump the heat. In the fight\nwith the Mardonalians, Seaton has an arenak cylinder on his compressor,\nand runs it very heavily, but if he can't get the heat outside the ship,\nand away from it, he wouldn't cool the machine at all. Since the\nMardonalians kept the outside so hot, and the story says the\ncompressor-cooling was accomplished by a water cooler which boiled--some\namount of water, too, if it would absorb all the heat of that\nMardonalian fleet in any way--and this heat was then merely transferred\nfrom outside to inside--where they DIDN'T want it!\n\nAgain, in this battle, to protect themselves against ultra-violet\nradiation, they smear themselves with _red_ paint--presumably because\nred will stop ultra-violet.\n\nPersonalty, I'd have picked some ultra-violet paint--if any were handy\nas that would _reflect_ the rays. Red wouldn't affect them at all, so\nfar as I can see--he might as well have used blue. What he wanted, was a\ncomplementary color of ultra-violet, and I don't believe it is\nred--green is the complement of red. (Green light won't pass through red\nglass.)\n\nDr. Smith invited \"knocks\" with that foreword of his--I hope I am\ncomplying, as an interested reader, and a hopeful scientist. However, my\npersonal opinion has always been that \"Skylark of Space\" was the best\nstory of scientifiction ever printed, without exception. I have recently\nchanged my opinion, however, since \"Skylark Three\" has come out.\n\nJohn W. Campbell, Jr.\n\nCambridge, Mass.\n\n\n(This letter from a fellow author is an excellent comment on Dr. Smith's\nforeword to \"Skylark Three.\" But the writer of this letter is himself\ninclined to deal with and use very large quantities and high\naccelerations and velocities in his stories. We are going to let your\nknocks await a reply from Dr. Smith. The Editor does not desire to find\nhimself between the upper and lower millstones represented by an author\nand his critic. But you certainly make amends for your criticism by what\nyou say about the merit of \"The Skylark Stories.\" We hope to hear from\nDr. Smith.--EDITOR.)\n\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------+\n  | Transcriber's Note & Errata                                  |\n  |                                                              |\n  | Images have been moved to their appropriate places in the    |\n  | text.                                                        |\n  |                                                              |\n  | All SmallCaps text has been changed to ALL CAPS.             |\n  |                                                              |\n  | The heading and title of Chapter VII were reversed in order  |\n  | in the text.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
