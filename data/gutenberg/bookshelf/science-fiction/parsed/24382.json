I know a girl who gags and throws up\nat the mere sight of a bird. Poor kid, when she was a barefoot moppet\nshe stepped on a fledgling robin in the grass. She hasn't gotten over\nthe squish of it yet.\n\nBirds don't trouble me. I can look at them all day. It takes snakes to\ngive me the green shudders. I hate them.\n\nShe was getting better at them, I decided. This was the fourth one since\nbreakfast and the roughest-looking of the lot. It was a diamondback\nrattler, and lay coiled on the rug at my feet. I turned my swivel chair\nslowly back to my desk and riveted my eyes to the blotter. Snakes are\nghastly things. But there was no future in letting them shake me up.\n\nI bent over in my swivel chair and swung my left arm like a flail just\nbelow this rattler's raised head. He struck at me, but late, and missed.\nThe swipe I took at him should have swept him over, but he got his coils\naround me. When I heaved back up straight before my desk, he was as\nneatly wrapped around my forearm as a Western Union splice.\n\nEnough of his tail was free to make that buzz that means \"Look out!\"\nAbout a foot of his business end stood up off my arm. His forked tongue\nflicked out over his horny lip, pink and dainty.\n\n\"Now, vanish!\" I said to the snake. It didn't. Instead the door to my\noffice opened, letting in a little more of the unmistakable smell of the\nhospital, as well as old Maragon, Grand Master of the Lodge. He was\ncomplaining and shaking a finger at me as he came toward my desk. He\ndidn't jump more than a foot when he got a look at my arm. His shaggy\ngray eyebrows climbed way, way up his forehead in a mutely shouted\nquestion.\n\nI wouldn't give the old goat the time of day. When I dead-panned him,\nhe shrugged and lowered himself into the chair beside my desk.\n\n\"Thought you hated snakes, Lefty,\" he said.\n\n\"A guy could get used to almost anything, Grand Master,\" I said. \"I\nfound a cobra under my pillow when I rolled out of the sack this\nmorning. A coral snake fell out of the folds of my towel when I went to\ntake a shower. Somebody stashed a bushmaster here in my locker to meet\nme when I dressed for surgery. I'm getting almost fond of snakes.\"\n\nMaragon semaphored doubt by squeezing his eyebrows down in a scowl.\n\"Even _real_ snakes?\" he protested.\n\n\"It's the most artful hallucination I've ever experienced,\" I granted.\n\"This snake has weight, a cold feel and a scratchy scaliness. This new\nwitch of yours really knows her stuff. I just would have thought...\" I\ndribbled off, raising my shoulders.\n\n\"Thought what, Lefty?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" I said. \"That it was somehow beneath the dignity of the Grand\nMaster to drag himself down here to the hospital just to add a little\nconviction to the hallucination. I mean, working up a big entrance, and\nall this pretense of your seeing a snake.\"\n\nHis smile was a little weary. \"Try a lift, Lefty,\" Maragon said.\n\nHe had finally overplayed his hand. Hallucinations don't respond to\ntelekinesis--there's nothing there to lift. I fixed on the rattler's\ncrouching head and lifted. The TK jerked the S-shaped curve out of his\nneck. I could feel his coils fight my lift. At some moment there I must\nhave gotten the point that _this_ snake was real.\n\nI guess I was screaming and shaking it from me for five minutes after\nMaragon had unwrapped the coils from my arm.\n\n\"All right. All right. All right,\" I said to him, shaking my head. \"So\nit had no fangs. You've still got me sold. I'll go to Nevada for you.\"\nI'd have gone clear to Hell to get away from that hallucinating witch he\nhad working on me. I'd gotten used to hallucinations--but who can get\nused to the doubt that one of those dreadful visions is real? I'd had my\nlesson.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt served me right, of course. It had begun when Peno Rose had first\nvisored me from Lake Tahoe. I had told him \"No.\" Too busy, _much_ too\nbusy, with TK surgery at Memorial Hospital. It didn't mean a thing to me\nthat some cross-roader with plenty of TK was stealing the Sky Hi Club's\ncasino blind. But Peno had known me from my days on the Crap Patrol, and\nwasn't much impressed that I'd reached the thirty-third degree. He'd\ngotten the Senior United States senator from Nevada to put heat on the\nLodge.\n\nWhen Maragon first visored me on it, I simply refused to discuss it and\nswitched off. That was the big mistake. I had an obligation to the Lodge\nfor my TK training, and there was no honorable way I could turn my back\non it. The Grand Master is a patient, if deadly, old goat, and he came\nafter me in person.\n\nI'd just walked out of surgery, and was still in mask and gown. The\nsurgeon who had done the cutting while I had put TK clamps on the\ninaccessible arteries was at my side, breathing a sigh of relief that\nthe patient hadn't died on the table. He'd still die, I figured, but not\non the table. I'd felt the fluttery rasp of his heart muscle as it had\nstrained against my lift. He didn't have too long.\n\n\"Thank God for a dry field,\" the scalpel surgeon said, politely holding\nout his left hand to me. I shook it with my left. That's why I hadn't\ndone the cutting, too. There aren't any one-handed surgeons. My right\narm looks fine. It just hasn't any strength. Old Maragon had told me\nonce that my TK powers were a pure case of compensation for a useless\narm. The surgeon dropped my hand. \"You're the best, Wally Bupp,\" he\nsaid. He's too good a friend of mine to call me \"Lefty\" and remind me\nthat I'm a cripple.\n\nIt was Maragon who did that. I hadn't noticed him, but somebody gave me\nthe grip, and I looked around. He was back against the wall, short, gray\nand square. I gave his ear lobe a TK tug in return, harder, perhaps,\nthan was necessary, and nodded for him to follow both of us to my\noffice.\n\n\"We'll have to talk about it, Lefty,\" he said, as he closed the door\nagainst the smell of iodoform.\n\n\"No, we don't,\" I said. \"I don't care who is losing how much money at\nPeno Rose's Sky Hi Club. Right here in this hospital people are dying.\nAsk old Thousand Cuts,\" I went on, nodding to the scalpel surgeon. \"We\njust pulled one out of the fire. When does this come in second best to\nsaving the skin of some tinhorn gambler?\"\n\n\"Your Lodge obligations come first,\" he said quietly. \"We have a\nreplacement for you here. Here's your ticket for Lake Tahoe,\" he added,\nholding out an envelope from a travel agency.\n\n\"I'm staying here, Maragon,\" I said. \"I'm a TK surgeon. I'm all through\ntipping dice.\"\n\n\"You may not find it practical,\" he said, getting up to leave.\n\nWell, I hadn't. Three snakes inside my head had made me a sucker for the\nreal one on my arm. Maragon had made his point. I might have reached the\nthirty-third degree, but I wasn't quite as big a shot as I thought I\nwas. I could feel that rattler on my arm all the way to Lake Tahoe.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLike any gambling house, the Sky Hi Club was a trap. Peno had tried to\nkid the public with a classy _decor_. It was a darned good copy of a\nnineteenth century ranch house. At the gambling tables everything was\nfree--the liquor, the _hors d'oeuvres_, the entertainment. Everything,\nthat is, but the gambling and the women. The casino was taking its cut.\nAnd the women--or should I be so sure?\n\nYou paid for your drinks if you stood up to the long mahogany bar. I\nturned my back to the rattle of cocktail shakers and chink of glasses,\none heel hooked over the replica brass rail, and took a long careful\nlook at the crap tables. There was a job for me at one of them. I began\nto shut out the distractions of sight and sound. I wanted nothing to\ndull my PSI powers.\n\nA blond bombshell slithered down the bar and ground herself against my\nleg. \"Wanna buy me a drink, honey?\" she gasped. I smuggled a lift and\nslipped all four of her garters off the tops of her hose. A funny,\nstricken look replaced the erotic face she had made at me. She headed\nfor dry dock.\n\nB-girls usually work in pairs, so I looked down toward the other end of\nthe polished mahogany. Sure enough, there was the brunette, frowning as\nshe tried to figure why the blond bomber had high-tailed it out of\nthere. I shook my head at her and she let it lie.\n\nThat should have cut out the last distraction. But no, I could see one\nmore bimbo working her way through the laughing, drink-flushed crowd\ntoward me. She had hair-colored hair, which was sort of out of character\nfor a barroom hustler. I put plenty of TK on the heel of her right\nslipper, and she stepped right out of it. It might as well have been\nnailed to the floor. Nothing was going to discourage this one, I saw. I\nlet her pick it off the floor, squeeze it back on her skinny foot, and\ncome toward me.\n\nThis new babe leaned over toward me and stuck her nose up against mine.\nIt was long, thin, and not a little red.\n\n\"Billy Joe!\" she said, and sniffled loudly. \"My darlin' Billy!\"\n\nHow near-sighted can you get? I don't think there's such a thing as a\ncase of mistaken identity around a guy like me. I didn't know her\ndarlin' Billy from Adam's ox. But I'd have bet a pretty we didn't look\nalike.\n\n\"You're wasting it,\" I told her, looking out over the crap tables. \"It's\nnew, and different. But I'm not _anybody's_ darling.\" A jerk of my head\ntold her to move on.\n\nBut she sniffled and stayed put. I gave up and started through the press\nof gamblers toward the Cashier's cage.\n\n\"Billy Joe!\" this hustler moaned behind me, clawing at my jacket. \"I\nknew I'd find you here. And I came sich a fer piece, Billy Joe! Don't\nmake me go off again, darlin' Billy!\"\n\nWhile I prefer to gamble for cash, I had reason while on a job for\nsticking to a known amount of chips. She stood there while I got a\nthousand dollars worth of ten-buck markers, looking at me with some kind\nof plea in her eyes. This again was not in the pattern. Most hustlers\ncan't keep their eyes off your chips.\n\nShe puppy-dogged behind me to the crap table I had decided needed my\nattention. It was crowded, but there's always room for one more sucker.\nAnd still one more, for the sniffly girl with the hair-colored hair\npressed in against my useless right arm when I elbowed my way in between\nthe gamblers, directly across from the dealers.\n\n\"Billy Joe!\" she said, just loud enough to hear over the chanting of the\ndealers and the excited chatter of the dice players. Billy Joe! What a\ncorn-ball routine!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI took stock before beginning to lose my stack of chips. There were more\nthan twenty gamblers of both sexes pressed up against the green baize of\nthe crap layout. Three stick-men in black aprons that marked them for\ndealers were working on the other side or the table. We had at least one\ndealer too many for the crowd. That screamed out loud the table was\nhaving trouble. Big gambling layouts know within minutes if a table is\nnot making its vigorish. A Nevada crap layout, with moderately heavy\nplay, should make six per cent of the amount gambled on every roll.\nThat's its vigorish--its percentage. If the take falls below that, the\nsuspicion is that the table is being taken to the cleaners by a crooked\ngambler, or \"cross-roader.\" The table I had picked was the only one in\nthe Sky Hi Club's casino with more than one stick-man working it.\n\nThe girl sniffled, and her long skinny arm reached around behind me to\nsnag a couple sandwiches the size of postage stamps from a waiter's\ntray. She wolfed them down, wiping at the end of her long nose with a\nwadded-up hunk of cambric. She'd done it before, and plenty, for her\nnose was red and sore. She made cow-eyes at me.\n\n\"Don't say it,\" I told her. \"I'm not your darlin' Billy.\"\n\nThe dice were to my right--I'd get them after a couple more losers\nrolled. My unwanted hustler stood on that side of me, too. They never\nhave any money of their own. I wasn't about to give her any of mine.\n\nI wanted to lose some dough in a hurry. I started playing field numbers,\nand TK'd the dice away from the field every time a gambler came out. Of\ncourse, I could have let the table's six per cent vigorish take it away\nfrom me, but that would have taken longer.\n\nEven with losing on every roll, the dice got around to me before I had\nlost the nine hundred I had set out to drop. I put four chips on the\n\"Don't Pass\" side of the line, shook left-handed because of my weak\nright arm, and got ready to come out. Sniffles seized me. \"Don't Billy\nJoe!\" she said suddenly. \"You'll lose!\" She pushed my chips across the\nline to the \"Pass\" side. That burned me up.\n\n\"Get your hands off my chips,\" I said, annoyed by bad gambling manners.\nHer face was all resignation and sadness. Well, not quite all. A lot of\nit was thin, red nose and buck teeth.\n\n\"You'll lose, darlin' Billy,\" she said.\n\n\"Pull those chips back!\" I said. Her eyebrows shrugged, but she did as I\ntold her. I came out, and tipped the dice to eleven. I kept the dice,\nbut lost my chips, which is what I wanted. Throwing six more down on the\n\"Don't Pass\" side, I rattled the ivories in my left hand. Tears began to\nroll down her unhealthy cheeks.\n\n\"Lose!\" she cried nasally, and sniffled. \"Billy Joe! Listen to me,\ndarlin' Billy! You'll lose!\" Her eyes rolled up toward the top of her\nhead as I ignored her and came out. Sniffles gasped, \"Hit's a seven!\"\n\nWell, that's the number I'd tipped them to, but she called it before the\ndice stopped rolling. That left me thirteen chips. Half absent-mindedly,\nI put three of them on the \"Pass\" side of the line and tipped the dice\nto twelve. Mostly I was looking at this scarecrow beside me.\n\n\"Box cars!\" one of the dealers called. \"My future home.\" But he wasn't\nas quick as Sniffles. She had called the turn before the galloping\ndominoes had bounced from the backrail.\n\nThe box cars cost me the dice. The next gambler blew on them, cursed,\nand rolled. I didn't bet, and spent the next couple rolls looking at\nher.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe girl was a mess. Some women have no style because they don't even\nknow what it means. Courturiers have taught them all to be lean and\nhungry-looking. This chicken was underfed in a way that wasn't stylish.\nThey call it malnutrition. Her strapless gown didn't fit her, nor\nanybody within twenty pounds of her weight. She was all shoulder blades\nand collarbones. I suppose that a decent walk would have given her\n_some_ charm--most of these hustlers have a regular Swiss Movement. But\nthis thing had a gait that tied in with the slack way her skirt hung\nacross her pelvic bones and hollered \"White Trash!\" at you.\n\nI wasn't much flattered that she had tried to pick me up. People have a\npretty accurate way of measuring their social station. And she thought\nshe was what I'd go for. Well, I guess I don't look like so much,\neither. I'd missed my share of meals when they might have put some\nheight on me. My long, freckled face ends in a chin as sharp and pointed\nas her nose. And there's always something about a cripple, even if my\npowerless right arm doesn't exactly show.\n\nMy days on the Crap Patrol came back to me. That's where the Lodge had\nfound me, down on my knees in an alley, making the spots come up my way\nwithout even knowing I could do it. And when they'd convinced me I was\nreally a TK, and started me on the training that finally led to the\nThirty-third degree, they'd put me right back in those alleys, and cheap\nhotel rooms, watching for some other unknowing TK tipping the dice his\nway.\n\nDid Sniffles have it? She wasn't tipping dice, exactly, but she sure was\ncalling the turn. She was tall, as well as skinny, and our eyes weren't\nfar apart. \"Billy Joe,\" she whispered above the racket of the gambler in\nthe casino, putting her mouth close to my ear. \"I told you, sugar. And\nnow you lost. You lost!\" Her perfume was cheap, but generous, and pretty\nwell covered up her need for a bath.\n\n\"There's some left,\" I told her. \"Show me how.\" She hugged my arm to her\nskinniness. That's all any of the hustlers ever want--to get their hands\non your chips. They figure some of them will stick to their fingers.\n\nThe gambler next to me had won a dollar bet without my help. He acted\nmighty glad for a win--maybe it was a while since he'd hit it. I decided\nto give him a run of luck.\n\nNow in charge of my chips, Sniffles called the turn on every roll. She\nwas hot. It wasn't just that she followed where the gambler next to me\nput his dough--she was ahead of him on pushing out the chips on half the\nrolls.\n\nHe quickly saw that my chips had stayed on the same side of the line\neach roll as his. He cursed me for a good luck mascot. \"Stick with me,\nLefty,\" he said. \"We'll break the table!\" I rammed a hard lift under his\nheart, and then, ashamed of myself, quit it. He turned pale before I\ntook it off him.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" I asked him, supporting his sagging elbow, still\nmad at myself for acting so childish.\n\n\"Nothing, nothing,\" he gasped, starting to recover. He'd only been\ndying, that's all. But it came in second-best compared to holding the\ndice.\n\nNo point calling too much attention to him. I decided four passes were\nenough while he held the dice. What do you know, as he came out for the\nfifth time, Sniffles pulled my stack of chips to the \"Don't Pass\" side\nof the line, while scraping at the chapped end of her skinny nose with\nthe back of her free hand.\n\nLike every compulsive gambler I've ever seen, the roller next to me was\nsure he was on a rampage. Four passes and he thought he had the dice\nlicked. \"Ride with me!\" he yelled at Sniffles, who plainly had the\nmanagement of my chips.\n\n\"No moah,\" she said. \"You'll lose.\"\n\nOf course he did. I TK'd the one-two up. \"Little Joe from Kokomo,\" one\nof the stick-men called. They raked losing bets and paid winners with\nthe speed of prestidigitators. \"Roller keeps the dice,\" the stick-man\ntold my neighbor.\n\nThe gambler cursed and threw the dice to the roller on his left. He spat\nblame at Sniffles for not riding with him. He was one big clot of\ncrushed misery. After all, hadn't he _wanted_ to lose? They all do. I\ncouldn't get very upset over his curses. So far he had lost one buck,\nnet. And he'd had some action. So much for gamblers.\n\nI kept control of the dice while each new gambler handled them. I was\nhaving a good night. Of course, by that time I had handled the dice,\nwhich always improves my TK grip. Every point I had TK'd came up. For\nall the perception I kept on the ivories, I could sense no other TK\nforce at work, which after all was the whole reason for my gambling.\n\nThe interesting note was the way Sniffles handled my chips. Sometimes\nmore sure than others, she occasionally let a winning stack ride. On\nother rolls, she keened and chanted oddly to herself, eyes closed, and\npinched down most of the stock. But she was never on the wrong side of\nthe \"Pass\" line. I kept track, not wanting my stack to build up past the\nthousand with which I had started. Most of all, I watched the skinny gal\ndope the dice, sniffle and wipe the end of her nose. She was one homely\nsharecropper, that was a fact, but she had a nice feel for Lady Luck. Or\nfor what I planned next.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWanting to come out with an even thousand, I adjusted the size of her\nlast bet. When I won it, I pulled my chips off the table, which Sniffles\ndidn't resist. She used the lull to grab a handful of sandwiches from\nanother waiter's tray. A gambler at the far end of the table came out,\ncalling loudly to the dice. The cubes made the length of the table,\nbounced off the rail and came to a stop dead center, between me and the\nthree stick-men in the black aprons. That's the instant when every eye\nis on the dice, trying to read the spots. And that's when the dice\njumped straight up off the baize, a good six-inch hop into the air, and\ncame down Snake Eyes, the old signal. Wow! I'd had it!\n\n\"TK!\" somebody yelled. He might as well have screamed, \"Fire!\" the way\nthat mob of gamblers scuttled away from the table.\n\n\"No dice,\" one of the dealers said automatically. He raked the hopping\ncubes sadly to him with his hoe-shaped dice-stick.\n\nI made a break for it with the rest of the crowd, trying to keep my eye\non Sniffles. But she had the sure-loser's touch of slipping away from\nany authority. She vanished into the milling mob. My last glimpse had\nbeen of a skinny arm reaching up to pluck some more free _hors\nd'oeuvres_ from a tray as she fled.\n\nI should have saved myself the trouble. They had a bouncer on each of my\nelbows before I had moved five feet. They carried more than dragged me\ninto a private dining room behind the bar. It went along with the ersatz\nrustic _decor_ of the rest of the Sky Hi Club. There was sawdust on the\ngenuine wood floor, big brass spittoons and a life-sized oil-color of a\nreclining nude, done with meaty attention to detail, behind a small\nmahogany topped bar. Stacks of clean glasses vied for space with labeled\nbottles on the back-bar.\n\nOne of the stick-men followed us into the room, taking his apron off as\nhe closed the door behind him, shutting out the roaring clatter of the\ncasino. \"Cross-roader!\" he hissed at me. I should have known what was\ncoming, but I missed it. He slapped me hard across the face, saving his\nknuckles, but not doing my jaw a whole lot of good. I would have fallen\nclean over, but the bouncers were still tight on my elbows.\n\n\"Wait!\" I tried to say, but he cuffed me with the other hand, harder, if\nthat were possible. This is the moment when you have to stop and think.\nA Blackout is quite effective--it's hard to hit what you can't see. And\nthere's something mighty unnerving about being stricken suddenly blind.\n\nOh, face it, I suppose the real reason I felt for the arteries supplying\nblood to his retinas was that so few TK's can do it. I clamped down\ntight, and his lights went out. He cried out in fright, and both hands\ncame groping up in front of him, his fingers trembling.\n\n\"I'm blind!\" he said, not able to believe it. He began to lose his\nbalance.\n\nI felt one of the bouncers go for his sap. \"Try it, you gorilla,\" I told\nhim, wrenching around, now that I was free on his side. \"Try it and I'll\nrip the retinas off your eyeballs the way you'd skin a peach!\" He\nrecoiled as though I were a Puff Adder. The other bouncer let go of me,\ntoo. I skidded in the slippery sawdust, scared half to death, but got my\nback against a wall just as the stick-man who had slugged me lost his\norientation completely and fell to his knees in the sawdust. It would be\nsome minutes before his vision started dribbling back.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe click of the door latch broke the silence. One of the other\nstick-men eased himself in, holding the door only wide enough to squeeze\npast the jamb. Don't give the suckers a peek at the seamy side. They\nmight just take their money to the next clip joint down the street.\n\nHe didn't look like the others, somehow. He was older, for one thing.\nPerhaps it was his nearly bald scalp, perhaps the thick, bookish glasses\nin heavy brown frames. \"What's that?\" he asked mildly, poking a finger\nat the dealer kneeling in the sawdust on the floor. My Blackout victim\nwas reaching out, trying to find something he could use to raise himself\nto his feet. His face was frozen in a fierce, unseeing stare as he\nmentally screamed at his eyes to see, see, see!\n\n\"Blackout!\" one of the bouncers told the second stick-man in a muffled\nvoice.\n\nSharp eyes fired a quick, surprised look at me. \"Well,\" said the bald\ndealer. \"Good evening, Brother.\" I had a surge of relief. The strong-arm\nstuff was over. This was the casino's TK.\n\n\"What kept you, Brother?\" I said, sounding a little sore. \"These\ncharacters were going to kick my teeth out.\"\n\nHis grin had a taste of viciousness. \"I did give them a little time,\" he\nagreed. \"How was I to know?\" He looked calmly at them over the tops of\nhis glasses. \"You can go now,\" he said, like a schoolmarm dismissing\nclass.\n\nThe gorillas helped the blindly staring dealer to his feet, brushing at\nthe sawdust that clung to his clothing, and had him presentable by the\ntime they led him through the door. They seemed glad to get away.\n\n\"The Blackout,\" the TK said musingly to me. \"You hear about it, and the\nPsiless cringe when they think it might happen to them. But you don't\nsee it every day. You're in the Lodge, of course?\" he added.\n\n\"Of course,\" I said coldly.\n\n\"Please,\" he said, waving a hand at me. \"Don't take it so big. So am I.\"\nFrom five feet apart we exchanged the grip, the tactile password\nimpossible for the Psiless to duplicate--just a light tug at each\nother's ear lobes, but perfect identification as TK's. \"I'm Fowler\nSmythe,\" he said. \"Twenty-fifth degree,\" he added, flexing his TK\nmuscles. \"What is it, buster? You on Crap Patrol?\"\n\nI paused before I answered. Twenty-fifth degree? Since when could a\ngambling casino afford a full-time Twenty-fifth? TK's in the upper\ndegrees come high. I had already figured my fee at a hundred thousand a\nday, if I straightened out the casino's losses to the cross-roader.\n\n\"Wally Bupp,\" I said at last, deciding there was no point to trying some\ncover identity. My gimpy right wing was a dead giveaway. \"Thirty-_third_\ndegree,\" I added.\n\nHe had a crooked grin, out of place beneath his scholarly glasses. \"I've\nheard of Wally Bupp,\" he admitted. Well, he should have. There aren't so\nmany Thirty-thirds hanging around. \"And you are young, smug and snotty\nenough to play the part,\" he concluded without heat. \"Still, that's all\nit might be, just play-acting, with Barney going through the motions of\nbeing blind. You could be outside the Lodge, sonny. Any cross-roader who\ncan tip dice the way you were working them can twitch an ear. Let's see\nsome credentials.\"\n\nHe scuffed through the sawdust to the bar and took a stack of silver\ndollars from his apron. He held them, dealerwise, in the palm of his\nhand, with his fingertips down, so that they were a column surrounded by\na fence of fingers.\n\n\"How many?\" he asked.\n\nI shrugged. \"The whole stack, Smythe,\" I told him. His eyebrows went\nhalfway up his tall, tall forehead. But he put them all down on the bar\ntop, about twenty-five silver dollars. \"Show me,\" I said.\n\nHe ran his fingertips down the side of the stack of silver. Another\ntactile. Well, he certainly wasn't much of a perceptive, or he would\nhave been able to handle the Blackout himself. He closed his eyes for\nthe hard lift. Some do that. The coins came up off the mahogany an inch\nor so, and made a solid smack when the lift broke and he dropped them\nback. Not very impressive work for a Twenty-fifth degree. The coins\nspilled over.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI used the excuse of straightening up the stack to get a touch, myself.\nI could have done it visually, of course, or I could have straightened\nthem up with TK, but touch helps my grip. I took a good look at the door\nto the main casino, a heavy job of varnished native cedar. Just to show\nhim, I turned my back on the bar, leaning against it with one foot on\nthe brass rail. The lift was as clean as I've ever managed. Anger, fear,\nany strong emotion, is a big help. They came up all together, staying in\na stack, and I could perceive that they hung in the air behind me, a\ngood foot clear of the bar, and about twenty feet from the door to the\ncasino. In a smug show of control, I dealt the cartwheels off the top of\nthe stack, one at a time, and fired them hard. Each one snapped away\nfrom the hovering stack, like a thrown discus. My perception was of the\nbest. Each coin knifed into the soft cedar of the door, burying itself\nabout halfway. My best sustained lift, I suppose is about two hundred\ntimes the weight of a silver dollar. But with the lift split by the need\nto keep the stack together, about twenty gees was all the shove I gave\nthe cartwheels. Still, you might figure out how fast those cartwheels\nwere traveling after moving twenty feet across the bar at an\nacceleration of twenty gees.\n\nSmythe gasped. I doubted he had ever seen better, even in the controlled\nconditions of Lodge Meeting. \"A little something to remember me by,\" I\nsaid, as I opened the silver-studded door. \"Now let's see the boss.\"\n\n\"You're a TK bruiser,\" he said, impressed. \"If you hit Barney's eyes\nlike that, he's a Blind Tom for fair.\"\n\n\"Hardly,\" I sniffed. \"You ought to know that no respectable TK would lay\na lift on a retina. I just squeezed off a couple of small arteries. He's\nback in business already, I'd say.\"\n\nHad I mentioned the rustic _decor_ of the Sky Hi Club? When Las Vegas\nhad deteriorated to the point where it would turn most stomachs, the\nbetter clubs migrated up among the tall pines, along the shores of Lake\nTahoe. And in place of the dated chromium glitter of Vegas, they had\nreached way back to the \"Good old days\" for styling. The Sky Hi Club was\ntypical. The outside was all hand-hewn logs. The inside had a low,\nrough-beamed ceiling, and a sure-enough genuine wood floor. The planks\nwere random-width, tree nailed to the joists. Even the help was dressed\nup like a lot of cow-pokes, whatever cow-pokes were.\n\nThis ersatz ranch-house was owned by two completely unlovelies. Peno\nRose, who had used his political leverage to get me on the job, I had\nknown since he'd been a policy number runner on the lower East Side. His\npartner, Simonetti, was something else, but somehow I wasn't looking\nforward to meeting him any more than I was to seeing Rose again.\n\nI guess it's the filth within these croupier types that makes them\nsurround themselves with the aseptic immaculacy of iridium and glass.\nTheir office was in a penthouse perched on the slanting roof shakes of\nthe casino. It was big as a squash court, and as high and as square.\nEvery wall was glass. It couldn't have been in greater contrast to the\ncontrived hominess of the casino if they'd thought about it for a year.\nThen, for the last twist, the furnishings were straight out of the old\nSouthwest--Navajo rugs, heavy, Spanish oak desks, and a pair of matching\ncouches or divans of whole steer leather stretched over oak frames.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPeno Rose came quickly toward me the moment Fowler Smythe showed me into\nthe office, spurs jingling. \"Hey! There he is! The boy they had to rule\noff the track! How's a boy, Lefty? Long time no see.\" He had his hand\nstuck way out ahead of him. His sharp, dried-out features repelled me\ntwice as much as they had ten years before. That hatchet face of his was\ngashed with what he thought was a smile. I've seen sharks with a\npleasanter gape. Naturally, I didn't take his hand.\n\n\"Hi, Peno,\" I said. He jerked his hand back and straightened up. He\nsnapped the hole in his face shut.\n\n\"My partner,\" he said, waving his hand at the dark-skinned gent standing\nover against one of the fumed oak desks. \"Sime, meet Lefty Bupp, the\nhottest TK artist with dice in the whole damned country!\"\n\nSimonetti leaned against the desk. He drew a zipper open in his fancy\nblouse, dragged out the Bull Durham and started to roll his own. They\nwatch too much TV. It makes terrible hams of them all. He spat on the\nfloor.\n\n\"A living doll,\" I said. I took a better look at this honey. Face it, he\nwas an oily snake, cleaned up as much as possible, but not enough. No\namount of dude ranch duds, gold spurs or Indian jewelry could hide his\nstiletto mentality. He was just a Tenderloin hoodlum with some of the\nscum scraped off. Well, I should know. So was I.\n\nSimonetti finished licking the seam of his roach. He came forward as he\nlit it and blew too much smoke in my face. \"What you doing here?\" he\nsaid in a husky voice. \"I told Rose no dice. We need another TK like we\nneed a hole in the head.\"\n\n\"You think I _want_ to be in this trap?\" I snapped at him. \"Say the\nword, Tex, and I'm gone.\"\n\n\"You're fired,\" he said huskily. \"Scram!\"\n\nI started for the door, glad to be rid of the lot of them. Peno Rose\nbeat me to it. He showed me several rows of teeth, the way sharks will.\n\"Half of this joint is mine,\" he snarled, holding a hand lightly against\nmy chest. He knew me better than to push. \"_My_ half is hiring you.\"\n\nThe whiff of garlic over my shoulder told me that Simonetti had followed\nme, too. He didn't have any reservations about grabbing me and twisting\nme around and giving me a real face-full.\n\n\"If you know what's good for you, you'll get out of here.\"\n\n\"Freak?\" I said, laying it on his mitral valve. After his heart had\nmissed about eight beats, he started to sink, and I quit the lift. \"Be\npolite, Simonetti,\" I said to the panic in his yellowish face. \"Next\ntime I'll pinch down tight. The coroner will call it heart failure.\nTough.\"\n\nHe wanted his stiletto. He needed it. He was sorry he had ever quit\ncarrying it. A couple seconds of reflection told him I was too tough for\nhim. He went for his partner, his face darkening with rage now that his\nheart could get some blood to it. He had his hands out, for Rose's\nthroat, I guess. For my dough it took guts to put fingers that close to\nall those teeth. But he never got a chance to try it. An ashtray, one of\nthose things with a shot-loaded cloth bag under it, flew off a desk,\nsmacked him in the back of the head, and dropped to the floor with a\nthump.\n\nIt wasn't a hard blow, but an upsetting one. Fowler Smythe grinned at\nhim from where he was sitting in one of the leather divans. \"Sit down\nand shut up, Sime,\" he suggested coolly.\n\nSimonetti sagged with defeat. \"Look, Rose,\" he gasped. \"I want out. Bad\nenough that our losses can't be stopped by this creep Smythe. Now you\ndrag in another TK. Buy me out!\"\n\n\"What's a business worth that's losing its shirt?\" Rose sneered. \"We\nwere in clover, you fool, till this cross-roader got to us. This is our\nonly chance to get even.\"\n\nThat finished Simonetti. He went back to his desk and slumped against\nit, scowling at the points of his handtooled boots.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRose looked over at me. \"Let's make sense,\" he said quietly. \"We watched\nyou on the TV monitor from the time you came in.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I said.\n\n\"What about it?\" he demanded.\n\nI shrugged. \"I had my way with the dice, Peno. I dropped nine yards as\nfast as I could, then won it back. The spots came up for me every single\nroll but two, when I had my eye on something else.\"\n\nHe snickered. \"We saw her,\" he said.\n\n\"How about it, Fowler?\" I asked my Lodge Brother. \"Was a worker tipping\nthe dice tonight?\"\n\n\"I never felt it,\" he said. \"But the table had dropped nearly forty\ngrand during the shift, which was about over when you started to play.\nHe's too good for me, Wally.\"\n\n\"But you felt _my_ lifts,\" I protested. \"You called 'TK' on the table.\"\n\nSmythe shrugged and took off his glasses. \"I thought I felt you tipping\nwhen you first came to the layout,\" he said, waving them around. I\nnodded confirmation. \"But it was smooth work, and I could hardly be\nsure. Most of these maverick TK's strong-arm the dice, and they skid\nacross the layout with their spots up. You're way ahead of that--you\ndon't touch them till the final few tumbles. And then, you were losing,\nand I couldn't see that the table was being hit.\"\n\n\"I thought it was the smart move.\" I explained. \"I was still\ncontrolling the dice, and if there'd been a cross-roader working, I\nshould have felt him skidding them.\"\n\nSmythe nodded. \"Of course,\" he added. \"I could feel you more clearly\nafter you got the dice, and later, while that scarecrow with you was\nhandling your chips. You were building a stack. So I fingered you.\"\n\n\"Careful,\" I said sourly. \"You're talking about the woman I love.\"\n\nThere was a strained moment of silence, and then they all laughed. She'd\nbeen a sight, all right.\n\nSimonetti came back alive with that one. His husky voice cut in on the\nlaughter. \"Where does that bag fit?\" he demanded.\n\n\"No idea,\" I said truthfully. \"A random factor. I don't think she fits.\"\n\n\"_Something_ has to fit!\" he yelled in his oversized whisper. \"How about\nthe way our losses follow Curley Smythe around from table to table?\"\n\nThis was something. \"The table you watch is the one that gets hit?\" I\nasked Smythe.\n\nHe blushed, clear to the top of his bald head. \"A subtle, nasty\noperator,\" he said gruffly. \"And he's had the gall to stick it in me\npretty badly, Wally. What Sime says is true.\"\n\nWell, this we wouldn't stand for. I didn't give a care if every gambling\nhouse in Nevada went broke. But Smythe was in the Lodge. And it finally\nmade sense that the Lodge had sent me to bail him out. I gave old\nMaragon my mental apology. The Grand Master wouldn't stand still for\n_anybody's_ making a fool out of the Lodge. Still: \"Nobody that good is\nout of captivity,\" I snapped. \"I don't believe it. It's not TK that's\nrobbing you.\"\n\n\"Oh, ridiculous,\" Rose said, showing his teeth. \"Gambling is our\nbusiness, Lefty. Don't you think we could spot any of the ordinary kinds\nof cross-roading? This is TK, and it has real voltage. We can't spot it.\nWe've got to have Psi power do it for us.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" I agreed. \"But no TK can do it if Smythe can't. Have you tried\na PC?\"\n\nSimonetti grabbed a piece of the heavens in rage. \"No!\" he yelled in his\nloud whisper. \"None of your crystal-ball witches in here!\"\n\nI knew how he felt. PC's give me the colly-wobbles, too.\n\n\"What's the matter with precognition?\" I asked him. \"If this crook has\ngot you stuck, Rose is right. Only Psi force will get you out of this\njam. If you know in advance where this operator is going to hit you, you\ncan nail him. There's a dozen techniques.\"\n\nPeno Rose looked at me from under lowered brows. \"Are _you_ a PC,\nLefty?\" he asked me.\n\n\"No,\" I said shortly. The Lodge had proved that several times, in spite\nof my strong feelings that I had flashes of precognition. Why should I\nresent not having PC? How many Psi personalities have more than one\npower? Not many. And as for precognition, as Simonetti said, more than\ntheir fair share is possessed by wild-looking women. Like Sniffles, I\nthought suddenly.\n\n\"Well,\" Rose said, turning back to his partner. \"Let Sime and me talk it\nover. Maybe we should get a PC.\"\n\n\"Nuts,\" Simonetti told him.\n\n\"I'll think it over, too,\" I said. \"See you tomorrow.\" I turned to go.\nSimonetti and Smythe followed me out, each for his own reasons, I guess,\nleaving Rose behind in the cube of glass on the roof, looking like he\nwas going to turn belly-up and take a bite out of the PBX on his desk.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI wasn't exactly shadowed, but I knew somebody had his eye on me as I\nwandered about the crowded casino, looking for Sniffles. As far as I\ncould make out, she had vamoosed without trying to hustle another\nsucker. Her percentage of my winnings had certainly been a\ndisappointment to her.\n\nAt last I went down the ersatz wooden steps into the neon-gashed night\nand started across the nearly deserted main drag toward the motel where\nI had registered. A powerful turbine howled as a car pulled away from\nthe curb, perhaps a hundred yards up the way. His lights came on and\nsnapped up to bright. I had a perfect flash of PC--I _do_ have moments\nof it, no matter what the Lodge thinks. The car was going to take a dive\ninto the fountain pool in front of my motel. But it sure didn't act like\nit. I froze in the middle of the road, hearing rubber scream as the\ndriver floored the throttle and hurled the automobile right at me. He\nmight as well have been on tracks. There was no place to go--I was in\nthe middle of a six-lane boulevard, and could never make either curb\nbefore he ran me down.\n\nThis is when it pays to be a perceptive. I've talked to many TK's about\nhow they visualize their lifts. We all conceive of it differently. With\nme a real strain is like shining a bright beam of light on the spot\nyou're lifting.\n\nBe glad, Wally Bupp, I had time to tell myself. Be glad for a mechanical\nmind. Where do you lift four thousand pounds of car aimed right at you?\nWell, there is a small valve, can't weigh half an ounce, lightly\nspring-loaded, that is in the power-steering mechanism. I seared a lift\nat it. You know what happened.\n\nThe feedback of the power-steering wrenched the wheel from the driver's\nhand--it was ten times as strong as he was, dragging its power as it did\nfrom a four-hundred horsepower shaft turning 30,000 rpm. The car\ncareened and skidded across the curb. It took out a small marble rail\naround the fountain pool and dived in, still screaming rubber. The\nfountain went over with a crash and then the racket dwindled off in the\nshriek of twisted buckets. The turbine had gotten what for in the\ncollision.\n\nI didn't hang around to see what had happened to the driver. He was just\nsome heavy who had the job of rubbing me out. But I did seek another\nhaven. If they knew me that well, I'd never be safe where I had stashed\nmy suitcase.\n\nThere was a 'copter squatting at the Sky Hi's ramp. I jumped for it and\nhad him drop me toward the outskirts of the town of Lake Tahoe, and then\nwalked a few blocks, mostly in circles to see if I were being followed,\nbefore darting into a fairly seedy motel a couple blocks off the main\ndrag.\n\nMy room was on the third floor of the flea-bag. Part of the place was\nonly two stories high. The door at the end of my corridor opened out\nonto the roof. When I had calmed down, I stepped through the door into\nthe cool of the desert night.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe gravel on the built-up roof crunched in the darkness under my feet\nas I walked cautiously to the parapet and looked over its edge to the\nhunk of desert that stretched away toward Reno, out behind the motel.\nThe third story, behind me, cut off the neon glare from the Strip and\nleft the place in inky darkness. There was silence and invisibility out\nbehind the motel.\n\nFeeling a little creaky about falling a couple stories to the ground, I\nlay down on my back on the narrow parapet, with my hands behind my head\nto soften the concrete a little, and looked straight up into the night\nsky. A dawdling August Perseid scratched a thin mark of light across the\nblackness. I heard a coyote howl. This was desert. This was peace. The\ndice and chuck-a-luck seemed ten thousand miles away.\n\nI heard a sound. Gravel crunched dimly under another foot. Somebody had\nstepped invisibly onto the roof. It scared the daylights out of me, more\nso because I was flat on my back. Cautiously I turned my head toward the\ndoor I had come through. I could see the fuzzy redness of a cigarette in\nthe dark. It brightened as the smoker took a drag. Then I heard the\nsniffle, and knew who it was.\n\nShe stood there, apparently leaning against the wall behind her,\nsilently, invisible but for the glow of her cigarette, and not moving\nher feet. \"Hello,\" I said at last.\n\n\"Wasn't sure you wanted to talk,\" she said out of the dark. It shook me\nup. She certainly couldn't _see_ me.\n\n\"How'd you know I was here?\" I asked her.\n\n\"I don't know how. But I knew you would be.\" That wasn't what I had\nasked, exactly. She sniffled, and I could almost see the back of her\nhand swipe at the bead of moisture that kept forming at the tip of her\nskinny nose. Made me think. Psi powers crop up more often than they\nshould in folks who are marked with a debility. It's the old\ncompensation story. Look at my weak right arm. What she had said about\n_expecting_ to find me on the roof sounded like precognition. And she\nsniffled and sniffled. Maybe it was one more of those tied-in hysterical\nPsi weaknesses.\n\n\"What are you doing out here?\" I asked her.\n\n\"Resting,\" she said wearily. \"I just hit town today.\"\n\n\"And tired already?\"\n\n\"I was broke,\" she said. \"Worked in a hotel laundry till dinner time to\nget eatin' money. Hot work. But I swiped a nice dress to wear when I\nwent looking for you, Billy Joe.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" I said, hiding my snicker over the dress. \"Say, I wanted to\nthank you for handling my chips. I'd have lost my shirt if I hadn't let\nyou show me how. I wanted to slip you a cut, but you bugged out of\nthere.\"\n\n\"I figured you should handle our money, Billy Joe,\" she said. \"Anyway,\ncan't take money for my gift.\"\n\nShe had me shaking with excitement. \"You have a gift?\" I said, trying to\nkeep my voice calm.\n\n\"Just some nights. Since I broke my vow, I've lost most of my prophecy.\nMy real gift is healing. Lost _all_ of that,\" she concluded, not\nbitterly. \"God is punishing me.\"\n\nGravel crunched as she came slowly across the roof toward me. The fag\nend of her cigarette made a spinning arc in the night as she snapped it\nover the side of the roof. Now there was no way to see her at all.\nPerception is nice in the dark. I tracked her automatically.\n\n\"What was the vow you broke?\" I said.\n\nShe sighed, near me. \"I divorced my husband, my own darlin' Billy,\" she\nsaid. \"There's no divorce in Heaven.\"\n\n\"Tough,\" I said. I thought _I_ was her darlin' Billy. Talk about\nDouble-think! \"Will you miss never having a man again? I mean, once\nyou've been a wife--\" I added, letting it drift off.\n\n\"God has been good to me,\" she said out of the dark. \"He let me see my\nown future, that he would give me a husband again.\"\n\nThat was a curve. \"Isn't that an even worse breaking of vows?\" I said.\n\"I mean, if in God's sight you're still married to Billy Joe?\"\n\n\"Would be,\" she conceded from the black, now right next to me. \"But He\ntold me that the man I should seek _would be_ Billy Joe--hit's a miracle\nworked for me.\" Her voice lowered. \"A miracle that come to pass tonight,\nmy darlin' Billy.\" A shiver ran its fingers up my spine. She meant every\nword of it. I _was_ her darlin' Billy.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI wasn't in any mood to get married, and least of all to a seeress.\nPrecognition is the least understood of the Psi powers, and the most\nerratic. But of all people, I could least afford to sneer at the power\nof Psi.\n\nFor the first time, I guess, I realized the awful helplessness that\ncomes over the Psiless when a TK invokes his telekinetic power. I wanted\nno part of the future this corn-fed oracle had conjured up. But it might\nbe the only future I'd ever have.\n\nI tried to recall her looks. Thinking about them, they really added up\nto no more than hysterical sniffles, not enough to eat, and the pathetic\nevidence that there hadn't been any money for orthodonture. Fatten her\nup, straighten her teeth and--Talk about _religious_ rationalization!\n\nI snapped out of it. Maybe she could call the turn of dice. But I'd be\ndamned if she could call the turn of people. Let her try _me_.\n\nI sat up on the parapet, swinging to put my feet on the gravel of the\nroot. \"So tonight you found the husband God's been going to give you?\" I\nasked.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said softly.\n\n\"And I'm the one?\"\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\n\"Not that again!\" I growled, grabbing her thin shoulders and shaking\nher. Her glasses bobbled on her nose. \"I'm _not_ your darlin' Billy, and\nyou well know it. Admit it!\"\n\nShe closed her lips over her buck teeth and sniffled. \"I reckon not,\"\nshe said, raising her head and looking at me without flinching. \"I lied\nto you.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Kind of made me feel more decent about bein' divorced.\"\n\nI gave her a last shake for the lie. \"Let's have it,\" I went after her.\n\"How much of what you've been feeding me is just window dressing?\"\n\nShe shrugged, but stayed silent.\n\n\"_Have_ you been married?\" I insisted.\n\n\"Yes, Billy Joe.\"\n\n\"_And_ divorced?\"\n\n\"Oh, darlin' Billy,\" she sighed. \"I jest shouldn't never a _done_ that.\nBut I did,\" she added.\n\n\"Talk English,\" I snapped. \"This chitterlin's and corn pone are just\nmore window dressing, right?\"\n\nHer face was solemn behind the glasses. \"When you are a smart girl, and\nyou know the future, too, they hate you and try to hurt you,\" she said.\n\"They don't seem to mind it so much if it comes from a piece of white\ntrash that never could be 'no account.' By the time I was twelve or so I\nhad learned to act just a little stupid and corn-fed.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis, her longest speech, she delivered in quiet, Neutral American, the\nspeech that covers the great prairie states and is as near accentless\nand pure as American English ever is. It branded her Ozark twang as a\nlie, and a great many other things about her. But it added something\nvery solid to her claims of prophecy.\n\n\"All this,\" I said. \"Because you see the future?\"\n\n\"Yes, Billy Joe.\"\n\n\"And this talk about losing your prophecy because of divorce was just\nthat, talk?\" I insisted.\n\nHer mouth worked silently. \"I talk like trash, and sometimes I start to\nthink like it,\" she confessed. \"I even act like it. I've tried not to\nsee things acomin'. But,\" she added, drifting back into her Ozark lingo.\n\"Always I knowed I was to find you. I knowed I was to go and search in\nspots of sin, for there you would be. And it kept getting stronger on me\nwhere to seek. This night I knew it was the time. I never got a dress\nand all before.\"\n\nThe chilly fingers touched me again. Still, what she was saying made\nsome weird kind of sense. \"What about the healing?\" I tried, feeling a\ntrap slowly descending over me.\n\nShe smiled at that. \"I guess I put that punishment on myself for what I\ndone,\" she said.\n\n\"Then you can still heal the sick?\" I asked. She shrugged. \"I want you\nto try,\" I added.\n\n\"Not till I get a sign,\" she said, moving uneasily. \"I'm to get a sign.\"\n\nI waved my hands in disgust and turned away from her. \"There had to be\nsome fakery in it somewhere,\" I said. \"You couldn't heal a hang-nail!\"\n\n\"Not a fake!\" she said hotly. \"I _have_ healed the sick!\"\n\n\"Don't get uppity,\" I said. \"So have I. You see,\" I told her. \"I'm a\ndoctor. Not much of a one,\" I admitted, pointing to my weak right arm.\n\"I can't heal myself.\"\n\n\"Oh, yore pore arm,\" she said.\n\n\"Show me,\" I said, turning on her. \"Heal me!\"\n\n\"I'm to have a sign!\" she wailed.\n\nWell, she got one. I took her to my room, pointed at the dresser. One of\nthe glasses on the tray beside a pitcher rose, floated into the bath\nand, after we had both heard the water run, came back through the air\nand tilted to trickle a few drops of water onto her head.\n\nHer words gave her away--she was no mystic. She swung her eyes back to\nme: \"TK!\" she gasped. She recoiled from me. She'd had a viper to her\nbosom.\n\n\"Heal me!\" I snapped at her. \"You've had your sign, and I'm your darlin'\nBilly.\"\n\n\"I got to find it,\" she said desperately. \"The weak place.\"\n\nI flopped on the bed, stretched my arm out against the counterpane. She\nran her fingers over it--the old \"laying on of hands.\" If she were the\nreal thing, I knew what it was--perception at a level a TK can't match.\nThe real healers feel the nerves themselves. I'd been worked on before.\nThe more hysterical healers, some really creepy witches, had given me\nsome signs of relief, but none could ever find the real \"weak place,\" as\nshe called it.\n\nShe was mumbling to herself. I guess you could call it an incantation. I\ngot a picture of a nubile waif, too freakish to fit where she'd been\nraised. What had her Hegira been like? In what frightful places had she\nfound herself welcome? From her talk, it could have been an Ozark\nbackwater. I didn't want to know what backwoods crone had taught her\nsome mnemonic rendition of the Devil's Litany.\n\nHer hands passed up beyond my shoulder, to my neck. \"It's in yore haid,\"\nshe said. \"In yore darlin' haid!\" Fingers worked over my scalp. \"Oh,\nthere!\" she gasped. \"Hit's ahurtin' me! Hurtin', hurtin', and I'm a\ndraggin' it off'n yuh!\" Her backwoods twang sharpened as she aped some\ncontemporary witch.\n\nHurt? She didn't know what it meant. She fired a charge of thermite in\nmy head, and it seared its way down my arm to my fingers. My right arm\ncame off the bed and thrashed like a wounded snake. She wrestled it,\nclimbed onto the bed, and held it down with her boney knees. Her fingers\nkneaded it, working some imaginary devil out through the fingertips,\ntill the hurt was gone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe sat close together on the edge of the bed at last, as I worked and\nmoved my arm, one of us more in awe of what had happened than the other.\nIt was weak--with those flabby, unused muscles, it had to be. But I\ncould move it, to any normal position.\n\n\"I never done like that before,\" she breathed. \"Jest small ailin'.\"\n\n\"You're a healer, all right,\" I said. \"And a prophetess, too, from what\nI saw at the dice table. You know what a Psi personality is?\" I asked\nher. \"Say, what is your name, anyway?\"\n\n\"Pheola,\" she said. \"Yes, I've heard of them,\" she said.\n\n\"You're one,\" I told her. \"You can heal many people.\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"Only could do it because I love you, Billy Joe,\"\nshe said.\n\n\"We'll teach you,\" I promised her. \"Would you like to learn? You've\nheard of the Lodge, haven't you?\"\n\n\"Lordy!\" she gasped.\n\n\"You're as good as in it,\" I told her. \"Now tell me, what am I going to\ndo tomorrow morning?\"\n\nShe got up and started to pace the room, sniffling. \"Why would you do\nthat?\" she said at length. \"You are going to the bank, first thing.\nYou've got all that money. It's thousand dollar bills! And you're\nwriting on them.\" She frowned at me, sniffling again. \"Do I _really_ see\nit?\" she asked. \"Is that right?\"\n\n\"I'll make it right,\" I said. \"Come on,\" I told her. \"If we're going to\nstay up all night, we need fuel. How long since you've tackled a\ntwenty-ounce sirloin?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Lodge has unmentioned influence. No, Psi powers aren't a secret\ngovernment. But what high official can afford to be at odds with us?\nThey know where the Lodge stands. A little while on the visor as the\neast pinked up got me what I wanted. Because of the three-hour time\ndifference, the Washington brass got me _carte blanche_ before banking\nhours at the Tahoe bank that supplied the Sky Hi Club with its cash.\n\nWorking with the cashier, who hadn't even taken time to shave after\ngetting his orders from the Federal Reserve Bank, I went over their\nstock of thousand dollar bills, as Pheola had PC'd I would, and marked\ndown the edges of the stacks with grease pencil. Mostly I did it to make\nmy grip firmer. When the time came, I could make that money jump.\n\nPheola let me get her a cocktail dress in one of the women's shops. The\nright dress helped, but more steaks would have helped even more. I'll\nbet I put five pounds on her that day. She was one hungry 'cropper.\nHungry and sniffly.\n\nWe idled away the afternoon and waited until nearly midnight to go back\nto the Sky Hi Club. Action is about at its peak then, and if the\ncross-roader had been tipping dice again, as they suspected, they would\nhave had time to notice which table wasn't making its vigorish.\n\nPlain enough where they were having trouble. Fowler Smythe was scowling\nthrough his glasses behind a table with Barney, the dealer I'd hit with\nthe Blackout. Their faces were sweating in the dry desert air. The table\nwas being taken.\n\n\"Now watch it, Pheola,\" I said, as we squeezed into the crowd, opposite\nthe dealers. \"Almost anything can happen. I want to know the instant you\nget a feeling. You understand?\" She nodded and wiped at her drippy nose\nwith a clean handkerchief. I'd gotten her a dozen.\n\nThere was the same old racket. The burnt out voice of a chanteuse,\ncoming over the PA system from the dining room, tried to remember the\nsultry insouciance with which it had sung \"Eadie was a Lady\" in its\nyouth. Waiters in dude-ranch getups swivel-hipped from table to table\nlike wraithes through the mob of gamblers, trays of free drinks in their\nhands. This time Pheola didn't have the same greedy grab for the _hors\nd'oeuvres_. She'd wrapped herself around a couple pounds of\nhigh-quality protein before we had come to the casino.\n\nThe gamblers were urging the dice with the same old calls, and the\nstick-men were chanting: \"Coming out!\" \"Five's the point!\" \"And _seven_!\nThe dice pass!\" and all the rest. The ivories had a way to go before\nthey reached us. I gave Pheola a stack of ten-buck chips and let her\nbet, without making any effort to tip the dice. She still had it. She\nmoved the chips back and forth from \"Pass\" to \"Don't Pass\" and won at\nevery roll. I could see Fowler Smythe begin to scowl as she let her\nwinnings ride, building up a real stack.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWithout warning she dragged down her winnings and leaned close to me,\nsniffling. \"You'll get all wet!\"\n\nI looked around, seeing a waiter near me. He had just served drinks to\nthe rear, half of the table, to the gamblers nearest the dealers. His\ntray was still half-full. This was the moment. It was a generalized sort\nof lift, the kind of thing that qualifies a TK for the Thirty-third\ndegree. I heaved at the thousand-dollar bills I had had marked in the\nmorning, without the faintest idea of where they were. The tray lurched\nin the waiter's hand, throwing glasses to the floor. Most of them\nshattered when they struck the real wood planks, splashing whisky and\nmix on our legs.\n\nI looked across the table and grinned at Fowler Smythe. His scowl had an\nawful lot of forehead to work on. \"What the devil!\" I could read his\nlips say over the racket. But Barney, the stick-man who'd felt my\nBlackout, caught on a lot quicker.\n\nI was about to freeze him with a clamp on his thyroid. It's just as\neffective as wrapping your fingers around the throat. But Pheola upset\nthe apple cart.\n\nShe grabbed my right arm, so newly powerful. \"No, Billy Joe!\" she cried.\n\"I _don't_ want to die!\"\n\n\"Who's dying?\" I snapped.\n\n\"He's shooting me!\" she gasped.\n\nShoot? With what? I had one terrified moment--what to lift? What was\naimed at her? At the last possible moment I saw it. His crap-stick was a\nhollow tube, and he was raising it toward _me_, not toward Pheola. I'd\nheard of things like that--a gas-powered dart gun. Silent, and shooting\na tiny needle with a nerve poison in grooves cut in its tip.\n\nI lifted, but half in panic. Fowler Smythe squeezed his trigger and the\ntiny dart leaped unseen across the crap layout. My lift had been way\noff--it should have thrown the stick toward the ceiling, where no one\nwould have been hurt. Instead it merely twitched the crap-stick, and the\ndart struck Pheola in the left hand. She screeched a little and grabbed\nat the needle-prick with her fingernails.\n\nYou never know how much power there is in Psi until you use it without\nrestraint. I threw the crowd back away from us with a lift that nearly\nblacked me out, and had Pheola on the wet boards of the floor before\nshe could blink. She had only seconds to live unless I blocked all\ncirculation to and from her arm. I found the spots in her armpit and\nlifted the veins and arteries into a complete block.\n\nA whiff of garlic told me that Simonetti had reached the table. He'd\nbeen watching on the TV monitor, of course. He knelt down beside us.\n\n\"A doctor, quick,\" I said. \"She's been pinked with nerve poison.\"\n\n\"She's gone, then,\" he said huskily. \"Who done it?\"\n\n\"Fowler Smythe,\" I said bitterly. \"A snake within the Lodge. You might\ntry to stop him. But your partner, Rose, is the real crook. Get the doc,\nthen tie up Rose.\"\n\n\"She's gone,\" he insisted. \"Nerve poison kills right now.\"\n\n\"He's right, Billy Joe,\" Pheola said softly. \"I'm going numb all over.\"\n\n\"What did I tell you?\" Simonetti husked at me. I had enough left to hit\nhim sharply over the temples with a lift. \"A doctor. With antidote,\" I\nsnapped. He trotted away.\n\n\"Darlin' Billy!\" she said, and her heart stopped. She was dead. I picked\nher up in my arms and carried her to the same sawdust-strewn private\ndining room where I'd given Barney the Blackout.\n\nI had to split the lift. The tourniquet was an absolute necessity, or\nmore of the nerve poison would enter her system. But her heart\n_couldn't_ stop. The brain can only stand a few seconds of that. I\nhadn't let it miss three beats. Even as I carried her from the casino, I\nlifted the main coronary muscle and started a ragged pumping, maybe\nforty beats a minute. Once in the smaller room I began artificial\nrespiration with my mouth.\n\nThe sawbones was there in three minutes. I guided the tip of his\nhypodermic into a vein in her right arm, the one that still had blood\ncoursing through it. He depressed the piston, pumping the antidote into\nher bloodstream. Little by little I let up on the clamp on her wounded\nleft arm, dribbling the poisoned blood into her system, so that the\nantidote could react with it gradually. She stayed unconscious.\n\nThen I felt it. Her heart muscle tugged back at my lift. It was\nstruggling to beat on its own. I matched my lifts to its ragged\nimpulses, feeling it steady to a normal seventy-two as the antidote took\neffect.\n\nHer eyes opened at last, and we stopped respiration. \"Billy Joe!\" she\nsmiled. She was back from the dead.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn an hour we had returned to the motel. She was as good as new, but\nbadly shaken.\n\n\"I still don't know what happened,\" she said.\n\nI shrugged. \"Smoke screen, Pheola. Every time there's a run of luck on a\ncrap table, somebody yells 'TK!' And I suppose there's a number of TK's\nwho aren't in the Lodge, and who figure to make a killing here and a\nkilling there by tipping the dice. But any decent TK, even a Fowler\nSmythe, can spot them.\n\n\"There was TK in this, but not tipping dice. Smythe is a skunk. He's no\nTwenty-fifth, or he wouldn't have any need to go crooked. He saw a\nchance to make a killing. He suggested it to Rose, who fell for it and\nwent along. Rose decided to steal Simonetti's half of the business from\nhis partner with Smythe's help. It was no more complicated than\nsmuggling thousand dollar bills off the table in false bottoms of trays\nthat drinks were being served on. Smythe was using TK to lift the bills\ninto those false bottoms, well screened by the trays from the TV\nmonitors. Barney was in on it, of course. And after the joint had lost\nenough dough that way, Rose and Simonetti would have had to sell out.\nOnly the buyer would have been a dummy for Rose and Smythe, using money\nSmythe had lifted off the tables.\n\n\"The whole TK business was just a smoke screen to keep matters\nconfused,\" I concluded.\n\n\"How come they dared send for a TK like you? Why weren't they scared\nyou'd catch them, just like you did?\"\n\n\"It took a little more than TK,\" I reminded her. \"TK is just a power,\none more ability in life. It doesn't make you God. Once in a while it\ngives you a little more vigorish than the other guy has, that's all. And\nsometimes it's not enough.\"\n\n\"But you had enough vigorish to catch them,\" she pointed out.\n\n\"In a way,\" I said. \"I told them TK wasn't enough--that it would take\nprecognition. And I don't have PC. I had to bring a PC with me. You,\nPheola. That's why I'm alive. Smythe would have killed me with that dart\ngun of his. _You_ were my vigorish!\"\n\nWe rode the 'copter together to the airport. Old Grand Master Maragon\nwould sneer out of the other side of his face when I brought Pheola to\nhim. He couldn't keep _her_ from PC training. She _had_ it.\n\n\"Tell me,\" I asked her. \"Can you always tell what I'm going to do next?\"\n\n\"I reckon,\" she said. \"If I think hard about it.\"\n\n\"But you can't _control_ what I'm going to do next, can you?\" I grinned.\n\n\"I wonder,\" she said. \"Never tried, yet.\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\" I groaned.\n\nShe showed me her buck teeth in a smile. \"I figger first you'll have\nthem straighten my teeth,\" she said. \"You'd like a pretty wife.\"\n\n\"If it's got to be,\" I said weakly. \"That would help. I just wish there\nwas some way to handle that hysterical sniffle of yours, that's all. But\nI guess that's the price you have to pay for that awful load of Psi\npower you have.\"\n\n\"Oh, that,\" she said. \"I ought to be over that by tomorrow. I hardly\never get a cold, darlin' Billy, and when I do, I throw it off in a few\ndays.\"\n\nWell, I guess it's a cinch I'm no PC.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Vigorish, by Gordon Randall Garrett\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK VIGORISH ***\n\n***** This file should be named 24382.txt or 24382.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/3/8/24382/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Bruce Albrecht, Mary Meehan and\nthe Online Distributed Proofreading Team at\nhttp://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
