DICK\n\nIllustrated by EMSH\n\n\n    _No weapon has ever been frightful enough to put a stop to\n    war--perhaps because we never before had any that thought for\n    themselves!_\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nTaylor sat back in his chair reading the morning newspaper. The warm\nkitchen and the smell of coffee blended with the comfort of not having\nto go to work. This was his Rest Period, the first for a long time, and\nhe was glad of it. He folded the second section back, sighing with\ncontentment.\n\n\"What is it?\" Mary said, from the stove.\n\n\"They pasted Moscow again last night.\" Taylor nodded his head in\napproval. \"Gave it a real pounding. One of those R-H bombs. It's about\ntime.\"\n\nHe nodded again, feeling the full comfort of the kitchen, the presence\nof his plump, attractive wife, the breakfast dishes and coffee. This was\nrelaxation. And the war news was good, good and satisfying. He could\nfeel a justifiable glow at the news, a sense of pride and personal\naccomplishment. After all, he was an integral part of the war program,\nnot just another factory worker lugging a cart of scrap, but a\ntechnician, one of those who designed and planned the nerve-trunk of the\nwar.\n\n\"It says they have the new subs almost perfected. Wait until they get\n_those_ going.\" He smacked his lips with anticipation. \"When they start\nshelling from underwater, the Soviets are sure going to be surprised.\"\n\n\"They're doing a wonderful job,\" Mary agreed vaguely. \"Do you know what\nwe saw today? Our team is getting a leady to show to the school\nchildren. I saw the leady, but only for a moment. It's good for the\nchildren to see what their contributions are going for, don't you\nthink?\"\n\nShe looked around at him.\n\n\"A leady,\" Taylor murmured. He put the newspaper slowly down. \"Well,\nmake sure it's decontaminated properly. We don't want to take any\nchances.\"\n\n\"Oh, they always bathe them when they're brought down from the surface,\"\nMary said. \"They wouldn't think of letting them down without the bath.\nWould they?\" She hesitated, thinking back. \"Don, you know, it makes me\nremember--\"\n\nHe nodded. \"I know.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe knew what she was thinking. Once in the very first weeks of the war,\nbefore everyone had been evacuated from the surface, they had seen a\nhospital train discharging the wounded, people who had been showered\nwith sleet. He remembered the way they had looked, the expression on\ntheir faces, or as much of their faces as was left. It had not been a\npleasant sight.\n\nThere had been a lot of that at first, in the early days before the\ntransfer to undersurface was complete. There had been a lot, and it\nhadn't been very difficult to come across it.\n\nTaylor looked up at his wife. She was thinking too much about it, the\nlast few months. They all were.\n\n\"Forget it,\" he said. \"It's all in the past. There isn't anybody up\nthere now but the leadys, and they don't mind.\"\n\n\"But just the same, I hope they're careful when they let one of them\ndown here. If one were still hot--\"\n\nHe laughed, pushing himself away from the table. \"Forget it. This is a\nwonderful moment; I'll be home for the next two shifts. Nothing to do\nbut sit around and take things easy. Maybe we can take in a show. Okay?\"\n\n\"A show? Do we have to? I don't like to look at all the destruction, the\nruins. Sometimes I see some place I remember, like San Francisco. They\nshowed a shot of San Francisco, the bridge broken and fallen in the\nwater, and I got upset. I don't like to watch.\"\n\n\"But don't you want to know what's going on? No human beings are getting\nhurt, you know.\"\n\n\"But it's so awful!\" Her face was set and strained. \"Please, no, Don.\"\n\nDon Taylor picked up his newspaper sullenly. \"All right, but there\nisn't a hell of a lot else to do. And don't forget, _their_ cities are\ngetting it even worse.\"\n\nShe nodded. Taylor turned the rough, thin sheets of newspaper. His good\nmood had soured on him. Why did she have to fret all the time? They were\npretty well off, as things went. You couldn't expect to have everything\nperfect, living undersurface, with an artificial sun and artificial\nfood. Naturally it was a strain, not seeing the sky or being able to go\nany place or see anything other than metal walls, great roaring\nfactories, the plant-yards, barracks. But it was better than being on\nsurface. And some day it would end and they could return. Nobody\n_wanted_ to live this way, but it was necessary.\n\nHe turned the page angrily and the poor paper ripped. Damn it, the paper\nwas getting worse quality all the time, bad print, yellow tint--\n\nWell, they needed everything for the war program. He ought to know that.\nWasn't he one of the planners?\n\nHe excused himself and went into the other room. The bed was still\nunmade. They had better get it in shape before the seventh hour\ninspection. There was a one unit fine--\n\nThe vidphone rang. He halted. Who would it be? He went over and clicked\nit on.\n\n\"Taylor?\" the face said, forming into place. It was an old face, gray\nand grim. \"This is Moss. I'm sorry to bother you during Rest Period, but\nthis thing has come up.\" He rattled papers. \"I want you to hurry over\nhere.\"\n\nTaylor stiffened. \"What is it? There's no chance it could wait?\" The\ncalm gray eyes were studying him, expressionless, unjudging. \"If you\nwant me to come down to the lab,\" Taylor grumbled, \"I suppose I can.\nI'll get my uniform--\"\n\n\"No. Come as you are. And not to the lab. Meet me at second stage as\nsoon as possible. It'll take you about a half hour, using the fast car\nup. I'll see you there.\"\n\nThe picture broke and Moss disappeared.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What was it?\" Mary said, at the door.\n\n\"Moss. He wants me for something.\"\n\n\"I knew this would happen.\"\n\n\"Well, you didn't want to do anything, anyhow. What does it matter?\" His\nvoice was bitter. \"It's all the same, every day. I'll bring you back\nsomething. I'm going up to second stage. Maybe I'll be close enough to\nthe surface to--\"\n\n\"Don't! Don't bring me anything! Not from the surface!\"\n\n\"All right, I won't. But of all the irrational nonsense--\"\n\nShe watched him put on his boots without answering.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMoss nodded and Taylor fell in step with him, as the older man strode\nalong. A series of loads were going up to the surface, blind cars\nclanking like ore-trucks up the ramp, disappearing through the stage\ntrap above them. Taylor watched the cars, heavy with tubular machinery\nof some sort, weapons new to him. Workers were everywhere, in the dark\ngray uniforms of the labor corps, loading, lifting, shouting back and\nforth. The stage was deafening with noise.\n\n\"We'll go up a way,\" Moss said, \"where we can talk. This is no place to\ngive you details.\"\n\nThey took an escalator up. The commercial lift fell behind them, and\nwith it most of the crashing and booming. Soon they emerged on an\nobservation platform, suspended on the side of the Tube, the vast tunnel\nleading to the surface, not more than half a mile above them now.\n\n\"My God!\" Taylor said, looking down the Tube involuntarily. \"It's a long\nway down.\"\n\nMoss laughed. \"Don't look.\"\n\nThey opened a door and entered an office. Behind the desk, an officer\nwas sitting, an officer of Internal Security. He looked up.\n\n\"I'll be right with you, Moss.\" He gazed at Taylor studying him. \"You're\na little ahead of time.\"\n\n\"This is Commander Franks,\" Moss said to Taylor. \"He was the first to\nmake the discovery. I was notified last night.\" He tapped a parcel he\ncarried. \"I was let in because of this.\"\n\nFranks frowned at him and stood up. \"We're going up to first stage. We\ncan discuss it there.\"\n\n\"First stage?\" Taylor repeated nervously. The three of them went down a\nside passage to a small lift. \"I've never been up there. Is it all\nright? It's not radioactive, is it?\"\n\n\"You're like everyone else,\" Franks said. \"Old women afraid of burglars.\nNo radiation leaks down to first stage. There's lead and rock, and what\ncomes down the Tube is bathed.\"\n\n\"What's the nature of the problem?\" Taylor asked. \"I'd like to know\nsomething about it.\"\n\n\"In a moment.\"\n\nThey entered the lift and ascended. When they stepped out, they were in\na hall of soldiers, weapons and uniforms everywhere. Taylor blinked in\nsurprise. So this was first stage, the closest undersurface level to the\ntop! After this stage there was only rock, lead and rock, and the great\ntubes leading up like the burrows of earthworms. Lead and rock, and\nabove that, where the tubes opened, the great expanse that no living\nbeing had seen for eight years, the vast, endless ruin that had once\nbeen Man's home, the place where he had lived, eight years ago.\n\nNow the surface was a lethal desert of slag and rolling clouds. Endless\nclouds drifted back and forth, blotting out the red Sun. Occasionally\nsomething metallic stirred, moving through the remains of a city,\nthreading its way across the tortured terrain of the countryside. A\nleady, a surface robot, immune to radiation, constructed with feverish\nhaste in the last months before the cold war became literally hot.\n\nLeadys, crawling along the ground, moving over the oceans or through the\nskies in slender, blackened craft, creatures that could exist where no\n_life_ could remain, metal and plastic figures that waged a war Man had\nconceived, but which he could not fight himself. Human beings had\ninvented war, invented and manufactured the weapons, even invented the\nplayers, the fighters, the actors of the war. But they themselves could\nnot venture forth, could not wage it themselves. In all the world--in\nRussia, in Europe, America, Africa--no living human being remained. They\nwere under the surface, in the deep shelters that had been carefully\nplanned and built, even as the first bombs began to fall.\n\nIt was a brilliant idea and the only idea that could have worked. Up\nabove, on the ruined, blasted surface of what had once been a living\nplanet, the leady crawled and scurried, and fought Man's war. And\nundersurface, in the depths of the planet, human beings toiled endlessly\nto produce the weapons to continue the fight, month by month, year by\nyear.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"First stage,\" Taylor said. A strange ache went through him. \"Almost to\nthe surface.\"\n\n\"But not quite,\" Moss said.\n\nFranks led them through the soldiers, over to one side, near the lip of\nthe Tube.\n\n\"In a few minutes, a lift will bring something down to us from the\nsurface,\" he explained. \"You see, Taylor, every once in a while Security\nexamines and interrogates a surface leady, one that has been above for a\ntime, to find out certain things. A vidcall is sent up and contact is\nmade with a field headquarters. We need this direct interview; we can't\ndepend on vidscreen contact alone. The leadys are doing a good job, but\nwe want to make certain that everything is going the way we want it.\"\n\nFranks faced Taylor and Moss and continued: \"The lift will bring down a\nleady from the surface, one of the A-class leadys. There's an\nexamination chamber in the next room, with a lead wall in the center, so\nthe interviewing officers won't be exposed to radiation. We find this\neasier than bathing the leady. It is going right back up; it has a job\nto get back to.\n\n\"Two days ago, an A-class leady was brought down and interrogated. I\nconducted the session myself. We were interested in a new weapon the\nSoviets have been using, an automatic mine that pursues anything that\nmoves. Military had sent instructions up that the mine be observed and\nreported in detail.\n\n\"This A-class leady was brought down with information. We learned a few\nfacts from it, obtained the usual roll of film and reports, and then\nsent it back up. It was going out of the chamber, back to the lift, when\na curious thing happened. At the time, I thought--\"\n\nFranks broke off. A red light was flashing.\n\n\"That down lift is coming.\" He nodded to some soldiers. \"Let's enter the\nchamber. The leady will be along in a moment.\"\n\n\"An A-class leady,\" Taylor said. \"I've seen them on the showscreens,\nmaking their reports.\"\n\n\"It's quite an experience,\" Moss said. \"They're almost human.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey entered the chamber and seated themselves behind the lead wall.\nAfter a time, a signal was flashed, and Franks made a motion with his\nhands.\n\nThe door beyond the wall opened. Taylor peered through his view slot. He\nsaw something advancing slowly, a slender metallic figure moving on a\ntread, its arm grips at rest by its sides. The figure halted and scanned\nthe lead wall. It stood, waiting.\n\n\"We are interested in learning something,\" Franks said. \"Before I\nquestion you, do you have anything to report on surface conditions?\"\n\n\"No. The war continues.\" The leady's voice was automatic and toneless.\n\"We are a little short of fast pursuit craft, the single-seat type. We\ncould use also some--\"\n\n\"That has all been noted. What I want to ask you is this. Our contact\nwith you has been through vidscreen only. We must rely on indirect\nevidence, since none of us goes above. We can only infer what is going\non. We never see anything ourselves. We have to take it all secondhand.\nSome top leaders are beginning to think there's too much room for\nerror.\"\n\n\"Error?\" the leady asked. \"In what way? Our reports are checked\ncarefully before they're sent down. We maintain constant contact with\nyou; everything of value is reported. Any new weapons which the enemy is\nseen to employ--\"\n\n\"I realize that,\" Franks grunted behind his peep slot. \"But perhaps we\nshould see it all for ourselves. Is it possible that there might be a\nlarge enough radiation-free area for a human party to ascend to the\nsurface? If a few of us were to come up in lead-lined suits, would we be\nable to survive long enough to observe conditions and watch things?\"\n\nThe machine hesitated before answering. \"I doubt it. You can check air\nsamples, of course, and decide for yourselves. But in the eight years\nsince you left, things have continually worsened. You cannot have any\nreal idea of conditions up there. It has become difficult for any moving\nobject to survive for long. There are many kinds of projectiles\nsensitive to movement. The new mine not only reacts to motion, but\ncontinues to pursue the object indefinitely, until it finally reaches\nit. And the radiation is everywhere.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Franks turned to Moss, his eyes narrowed oddly. \"Well, that was\nwhat I wanted to know. You may go.\"\n\nThe machine moved back toward its exit. It paused. \"Each month the\namount of lethal particles in the atmosphere increases. The tempo of the\nwar is gradually--\"\n\n\"I understand.\" Franks rose. He held out his hand and Moss passed him\nthe package. \"One thing before you leave. I want you to examine a new\ntype of metal shield material. I'll pass you a sample with the tong.\"\n\nFranks put the package in the toothed grip and revolved the tong so that\nhe held the other end. The package swung down to the leady, which took\nit. They watched it unwrap the package and take the metal plate in its\nhands. The leady turned the metal over and over.\n\nSuddenly it became rigid.\n\n\"All right,\" Franks said.\n\nHe put his shoulder against the wall and a section slid aside. Taylor\ngasped--Franks and Moss were hurrying up to the leady!\n\n\"Good God!\" Taylor said. \"But it's radioactive!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe leady stood unmoving, still holding the metal. Soldiers appeared in\nthe chamber. They surrounded the leady and ran a counter across it\ncarefully.\n\n\"Okay, sir,\" one of them said to Franks. \"It's as cold as a long winter\nevening.\"\n\n\"Good. I was sure, but I didn't want to take any chances.\"\n\n\"You see,\" Moss said to Taylor, \"this leady isn't hot at all. Yet it\ncame directly from the surface, without even being bathed.\"\n\n\"But what does it mean?\" Taylor asked blankly.\n\n\"It may be an accident,\" Franks said. \"There's always the possibility\nthat a given object might escape being exposed above. But this is the\nsecond time it's happened that we know of. There may be others.\"\n\n\"The second time?\"\n\n\"The previous interview was when we noticed it. The leady was not hot.\nIt was cold, too, like this one.\"\n\nMoss took back the metal plate from the leady's hands. He pressed the\nsurface carefully and returned it to the stiff, unprotesting fingers.\n\n\"We shorted it out with this, so we could get close enough for a\nthorough check. It'll come back on in a second now. We had better get\nbehind the wall again.\"\n\nThey walked back and the lead wall swung closed behind them. The\nsoldiers left the chamber.\n\n\"Two periods from now,\" Franks said softly, \"an initial investigating\nparty will be ready to go surface-side. We're going up the Tube in\nsuits, up to the top--the first human party to leave undersurface in\neight years.\"\n\n\"It may mean nothing,\" Moss said, \"but I doubt it. Something's going on,\nsomething strange. The leady told us no life could exist above without\nbeing roasted. The story doesn't fit.\"\n\nTaylor nodded. He stared through the peep slot at the immobile metal\nfigure. Already the leady was beginning to stir. It was bent in several\nplaces, dented and twisted, and its finish was blackened and charred. It\nwas a leady that had been up there a long time; it had seen war and\ndestruction, ruin so vast that no human being could imagine the extent.\nIt had crawled and slunk in a world of radiation and death, a world\nwhere no life could exist.\n\nAnd Taylor had touched it!\n\n\"You're going with us,\" Franks said suddenly. \"I want you along. I think\nthe three of us will go.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMary faced him with a sick and frightened expression. \"I know it. You're\ngoing to the surface. Aren't you?\"\n\nShe followed him into the kitchen. Taylor sat down, looking away from\nher.\n\n\"It's a classified project,\" he evaded. \"I can't tell you anything about\nit.\"\n\n\"You don't have to tell me. I know. I knew it the moment you came in.\nThere was something on your face, something I haven't seen there for a\nlong, long time. It was an old look.\"\n\nShe came toward him. \"But how can they send you to the surface?\" She\ntook his face in her shaking hands, making him look at her. There was a\nstrange hunger in her eyes. \"Nobody can live up there. Look, look at\nthis!\"\n\nShe grabbed up a newspaper and held it in front of him.\n\n\"Look at this photograph. America, Europe, Asia, Africa--nothing but\nruins. We've seen it every day on the showscreens. All destroyed,\npoisoned. And they're sending you up. Why? No living thing can get by up\nthere, not even a weed, or grass. They've wrecked the surface, haven't\nthey? _Haven't they?_\"\n\nTaylor stood up. \"It's an order. I know nothing about it. I was told to\nreport to join a scout party. That's all I know.\"\n\nHe stood for a long time, staring ahead. Slowly, he reached for the\nnewspaper and held it up to the light.\n\n\"It looks real,\" he murmured. \"Ruins, deadness, slag. It's convincing.\nAll the reports, photographs, films, even air samples. Yet we haven't\nseen it for ourselves, not after the first months ...\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\" He put the paper down. \"I'm leaving early after the next\nSleep Period. Let's turn in.\"\n\nMary turned away, her face hard and harsh. \"Do what you want. We might\njust as well all go up and get killed at once, instead of dying slowly\ndown here, like vermin in the ground.\"\n\nHe had not realized how resentful she was. Were they all like that? How\nabout the workers toiling in the factories, day and night, endlessly?\nThe pale, stooped men and women, plodding back and forth to work,\nblinking in the colorless light, eating synthetics--\n\n\"You shouldn't be so bitter,\" he said.\n\nMary smiled a little. \"I'm bitter because I know you'll never come\nback.\" She turned away. \"I'll never see you again, once you go up\nthere.\"\n\nHe was shocked. \"What? How can you say a thing like that?\"\n\nShe did not answer.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe awakened with the public newscaster screeching in his ears, shouting\noutside the building.\n\n\"Special news bulletin! Surface forces report enormous Soviet attack\nwith new weapons! Retreat of key groups! All work units report to\nfactories at once!\"\n\nTaylor blinked, rubbing his eyes. He jumped out of bed and hurried to\nthe vidphone. A moment later he was put through to Moss.\n\n\"Listen,\" he said. \"What about this new attack? Is the project off?\" He\ncould see Moss's desk, covered with reports and papers.\n\n\"No,\" Moss said. \"We're going right ahead. Get over here at once.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Don't argue with me.\" Moss held up a handful of surface bulletins,\ncrumpling them savagely. \"This is a fake. Come on!\" He broke off.\n\nTaylor dressed furiously, his mind in a daze.\n\nHalf an hour later, he leaped from a fast car and hurried up the stairs\ninto the Synthetics Building. The corridors were full of men and women\nrushing in every direction. He entered Moss's office.\n\n\"There you are,\" Moss said, getting up immediately. \"Franks is waiting\nfor us at the outgoing station.\"\n\nThey went in a Security Car, the siren screaming. Workers scattered out\nof their way.\n\n\"What about the attack?\" Taylor asked.\n\nMoss braced his shoulders. \"We're certain that we've forced their hand.\nWe've brought the issue to a head.\"\n\nThey pulled up at the station link of the Tube and leaped out. A moment\nlater they were moving up at high speed toward the first stage.\n\nThey emerged into a bewildering scene of activity. Soldiers were\nfastening on lead suits, talking excitedly to each other, shouting back\nand forth. Guns were being given out, instructions passed.\n\nTaylor studied one of the soldiers. He was armed with the dreaded Bender\npistol, the new snub-nosed hand weapon that was just beginning to come\nfrom the assembly line. Some of the soldiers looked a little frightened.\n\n\"I hope we're not making a mistake,\" Moss said, noticing his gaze.\n\nFranks came toward them. \"Here's the program. The three of us are going\nup first, alone. The soldiers will follow in fifteen minutes.\"\n\n\"What are we going to tell the leadys?\" Taylor worriedly asked. \"We'll\nhave to tell them something.\"\n\n\"We want to observe the new Soviet attack.\" Franks smiled ironically.\n\"Since it seems to be so serious, we should be there in person to\nwitness it.\"\n\n\"And then what?\" Taylor said.\n\n\"That'll be up to them. Let's go.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn a small car, they went swiftly up the Tube, carried by anti-grav\nbeams from below. Taylor glanced down from time to time. It was a long\nway back, and getting longer each moment. He sweated nervously inside\nhis suit, gripping his Bender pistol with inexpert fingers.\n\nWhy had they chosen him? Chance, pure chance. Moss had asked him to come\nalong as a Department member. Then Franks had picked him out on the spur\nof the moment. And now they were rushing toward the surface, faster and\nfaster.\n\nA deep fear, instilled in him for eight years, throbbed in his mind.\nRadiation, certain death, a world blasted and lethal--\n\nUp and up the car went. Taylor gripped the sides and closed his eyes.\nEach moment they were closer, the first living creatures to go above the\nfirst stage, up the Tube past the lead and rock, up to the surface. The\nphobic horror shook him in waves. It was death; they all knew that.\nHadn't they seen it in the films a thousand times? The cities, the sleet\ncoming down, the rolling clouds--\n\n\"It won't be much longer,\" Franks said. \"We're almost there. The surface\ntower is not expecting us. I gave orders that no signal was to be sent.\"\n\nThe car shot up, rushing furiously. Taylor's head spun; he hung on, his\neyes shut. Up and up....\n\nThe car stopped. He opened his eyes.\n\nThey were in a vast room, fluorescent-lit, a cavern filled with\nequipment and machinery, endless mounds of material piled in row after\nrow. Among the stacks, leadys were working silently, pushing trucks and\nhandcarts.\n\n\"Leadys,\" Moss said. His face was pale. \"Then we're really on the\nsurface.\"\n\nThe leadys were going back and forth with equipment moving the vast\nstores of guns and spare parts, ammunition and supplies that had been\nbrought to the surface. And this was the receiving station for only one\nTube; there were many others, scattered throughout the continent.\n\nTaylor looked nervously around him. They were really there, above\nground, on the surface. This was where the war was.\n\n\"Come on,\" Franks said. \"A B-class guard is coming our way.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey stepped out of the car. A leady was approaching them rapidly. It\ncoasted up in front of them and stopped, scanning them with its\nhand-weapon raised.\n\n\"This is Security,\" Franks said. \"Have an A-class sent to me at once.\"\n\nThe leady hesitated. Other B-class guards were coming, scooting across\nthe floor, alert and alarmed. Moss peered around.\n\n\"Obey!\" Franks said in a loud, commanding voice. \"You've been ordered!\"\n\nThe leady moved uncertainly away from them. At the end of the building,\na door slid back. Two A-class leadys appeared, coming slowly toward\nthem. Each had a green stripe across its front.\n\n\"From the Surface Council,\" Franks whispered tensely. \"This is above\nground, all right. Get set.\"\n\nThe two leadys approached warily. Without speaking, they stopped close\nby the men, looking them up and down.\n\n\"I'm Franks of Security. We came from undersurface in order to--\"\n\n\"This in incredible,\" one of the leadys interrupted him coldly. \"You\nknow you can't live up here. The whole surface is lethal to you. You\ncan't possibly remain on the surface.\"\n\n\"These suits will protect us,\" Franks said. \"In any case, it's not your\nresponsibility. What I want is an immediate Council meeting so I can\nacquaint myself with conditions, with the situation here. Can that be\narranged?\"\n\n\"You human beings can't survive up here. And the new Soviet attack is\ndirected at this area. It is in considerable danger.\"\n\n\"We know that. Please assemble the Council.\" Franks looked around him at\nthe vast room, lit by recessed lamps in the ceiling. An uncertain\nquality came into his voice. \"Is it night or day right now?\"\n\n\"Night,\" one of the A-class leadys said, after a pause. \"Dawn is coming\nin about two hours.\"\n\nFranks nodded. \"We'll remain at least two hours, then. As a concession\nto our sentimentality, would you please show us some place where we can\nobserve the Sun as it comes up? We would appreciate it.\"\n\nA stir went through the leadys.\n\n\"It is an unpleasant sight,\" one of the leadys said. \"You've seen the\nphotographs; you know what you'll witness. Clouds of drifting particles\nblot out the light, slag heaps are everywhere, the whole land is\ndestroyed. For you it will be a staggering sight, much worse than\npictures and film can convey.\"\n\n\"However it may be, we'll stay long enough to see it. Will you give the\norder to the Council?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Come this way.\" Reluctantly, the two leadys coasted toward the wall of\nthe warehouse. The three men trudged after them, their heavy shoes\nringing against the concrete. At the wall, the two leadys paused.\n\n\"This is the entrance to the Council Chamber. There are windows in the\nChamber Room, but it is still dark outside, of course. You'll see\nnothing right now, but in two hours--\"\n\n\"Open the door,\" Franks said.\n\nThe door slid back. They went slowly inside. The room was small, a neat\nroom with a round table in the center, chairs ringing it. The three of\nthem sat down silently, and the two leadys followed after them, taking\ntheir places.\n\n\"The other Council Members are on their way. They have already been\nnotified and are coming as quickly as they can. Again I urge you to go\nback down.\" The leady surveyed the three human beings. \"There is no way\nyou can meet the conditions up here. Even we survive with some trouble,\nourselves. How can you expect to do it?\"\n\nThe leader approached Franks.\n\n\"This astonishes and perplexes us,\" it said. \"Of course we must do what\nyou tell us, but allow me to point out that if you remain here--\"\n\n\"We know,\" Franks said impatiently. \"However, we intend to remain, at\nleast until sunrise.\"\n\n\"If you insist.\"\n\nThere was silence. The leadys seemed to be conferring with each other,\nalthough the three men heard no sound.\n\n\"For your own good,\" the leader said at last, \"you must go back down. We\nhave discussed this, and it seems to us that you are doing the wrong\nthing for your own good.\"\n\n\"We are human beings,\" Franks said sharply. \"Don't you understand? We're\nmen, not machines.\"\n\n\"That is precisely why you must go back. This room is radioactive; all\nsurface areas are. We calculate that your suits will not protect you for\nover fifty more minutes. Therefore--\"\n\nThe leadys moved abruptly toward the men, wheeling in a circle, forming\na solid row. The men stood up, Taylor reaching awkwardly for his weapon,\nhis fingers numb and stupid. The men stood facing the silent metal\nfigures.\n\n\"We must insist,\" the leader said, its voice without emotion. \"We must\ntake you back to the Tube and send you down on the next car. I am sorry,\nbut it is necessary.\"\n\n\"What'll we do?\" Moss said nervously to Franks. He touched his gun.\n\"Shall we blast them?\"\n\nFranks shook his head. \"All right,\" he said to the leader. \"We'll go\nback.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe moved toward the door, motioning Taylor and Moss to follow him. They\nlooked at him in surprise, but they came with him. The leadys followed\nthem out into the great warehouse. Slowly they moved toward the Tube\nentrance, none of them speaking.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAt the lip, Franks turned. \"We are going back because we have no choice.\nThere are three of us and about a dozen of you. However, if--\"\n\n\"Here comes the car,\" Taylor said.\n\nThere was a grating sound from the Tube. D-class leadys moved toward the\nedge to receive it.\n\n\"I am sorry,\" the leader said, \"but it is for your protection. We are\nwatching over you, literally. You must stay below and let us conduct the\nwar. In a sense, it has come to be _our_ war. We must fight it as we see\nfit.\"\n\nThe car rose to the surface.\n\nTwelve soldiers, armed with Bender pistols, stepped from it and\nsurrounded the three men.\n\nMoss breathed a sigh of relief. \"Well, this does change things. It came\noff just right.\"\n\nThe leader moved back, away from the soldiers. It studied them\nintently, glancing from one to the next, apparently trying to make up\nits mind. At last it made a sign to the other leadys. They coasted aside\nand a corridor was opened up toward the warehouse.\n\n\"Even now,\" the leader said, \"we could send you back by force. But it is\nevident that this is not really an observation party at all. These\nsoldiers show that you have much more in mind; this was all carefully\nprepared.\"\n\n\"Very carefully,\" Franks said.\n\nThey closed in.\n\n\"How much more, we can only guess. I must admit that we were taken\nunprepared. We failed utterly to meet the situation. Now force would be\nabsurd, because neither side can afford to injure the other; we, because\nof the restrictions placed on us regarding human life, you because the\nwar demands--\"\n\nThe soldiers fired, quick and in fright. Moss dropped to one knee,\nfiring up. The leader dissolved in a cloud of particles. On all sides\nD- and B-class leadys were rushing up, some with weapons, some with\nmetal slats. The room was in confusion. Off in the distance a siren was\nscreaming. Franks and Taylor were cut off from the others, separated\nfrom the soldiers by a wall of metal bodies.\n\n\"They can't fire back,\" Franks said calmly. \"This is another bluff.\nThey've tried to bluff us all the way.\" He fired into the face of a\nleady. The leady dissolved. \"They can only try to frighten us. Remember\nthat.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey went on firing and leady after leady vanished. The room reeked with\nthe smell of burning metal, the stink of fused plastic and steel. Taylor\nhad been knocked down. He was struggling to find his gun, reaching\nwildly among metal legs, groping frantically to find it. His fingers\nstrained, a handle swam in front of him. Suddenly something came down on\nhis arm, a metal foot. He cried out.\n\nThen it was over. The leadys were moving away, gathering together off to\none side. Only four of the Surface Council remained. The others were\nradioactive particles in the air. D-class leadys were already restoring\norder, gathering up partly destroyed metal figures and bits and removing\nthem.\n\nFranks breathed a shuddering sigh.\n\n\"All right,\" he said. \"You can take us back to the windows. It won't be\nlong now.\"\n\nThe leadys separated, and the human group, Moss and Franks and Taylor\nand the soldiers, walked slowly across the room, toward the door. They\nentered the Council Chamber. Already a faint touch of gray mitigated the\nblackness of the windows.\n\n\"Take us outside,\" Franks said impatiently. \"We'll see it directly, not\nin here.\"\n\nA door slid open. A chill blast of cold morning air rushed in, chilling\nthem even through their lead suits. The men glanced at each other\nuneasily.\n\n\"Come on,\" Franks said. \"Outside.\"\n\nHe walked out through the door, the others following him.\n\nThey were on a hill, overlooking the vast bowl of a valley. Dimly,\nagainst the graying sky, the outline of mountains were forming, becoming\ntangible.\n\n\"It'll be bright enough to see in a few minutes,\" Moss said. He\nshuddered as a chilling wind caught him and moved around him. \"It's\nworth it, really worth it, to see this again after eight years. Even if\nit's the last thing we see--\"\n\n\"Watch,\" Franks snapped.\n\nThey obeyed, silent and subdued. The sky was clearing, brightening each\nmoment. Some place far off, echoing across the valley, a rooster crowed.\n\n\"A chicken!\" Taylor murmured. \"Did you hear?\"\n\nBehind them, the leadys had come out and were standing silently,\nwatching, too. The gray sky turned to white and the hills appeared more\nclearly. Light spread across the valley floor, moving toward them.\n\n\"God in heaven!\" Franks exclaimed.\n\nTrees, trees and forests. A valley of plants and trees, with a few roads\nwinding among them. Farmhouses. A windmill. A barn, far down below them.\n\n\"Look!\" Moss whispered.\n\nColor came into the sky. The Sun was approaching. Birds began to sing.\nNot far from where they stood, the leaves of a tree danced in the wind.\n\nFranks turned to the row of leadys behind them.\n\n\"Eight years. We were tricked. There was no war. As soon as we left the\nsurface--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" an A-class leady admitted. \"As soon as you left, the war ceased.\nYou're right, it was a hoax. You worked hard undersurface, sending up\nguns and weapons, and we destroyed them as fast as they came up.\"\n\n\"But why?\" Taylor asked, dazed. He stared down at the vast valley below.\n\"Why?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You created us,\" the leady said, \"to pursue the war for you, while you\nhuman beings went below the ground in order to survive. But before we\ncould continue the war, it was necessary to analyze it to determine what\nits purpose was. We did this, and we found that it had no purpose,\nexcept, perhaps, in terms of human needs. Even this was questionable.\n\n\"We investigated further. We found that human cultures pass through\nphases, each culture in its own time. As the culture ages and begins to\nlose its objectives, conflict arises within it between those who wish to\ncast it off and set up a new culture-pattern, and those who wish to\nretain the old with as little change as possible.\n\n\"At this point, a great danger appears. The conflict within threatens to\nengulf the society in self-war, group against group. The vital\ntraditions may be lost--not merely altered or reformed, but completely\ndestroyed in this period of chaos and anarchy. We have found many such\nexamples in the history of mankind.\n\n\"It is necessary for this hatred within the culture to be directed\noutward, toward an external group, so that the culture itself may\nsurvive its crisis. War is the result. War, to a logical mind, is\nabsurd. But in terms of human needs, it plays a vital role. And it will\ncontinue to until Man has grown up enough so that no hatred lies within\nhim.\"\n\nTaylor was listening intently. \"Do you think this time will come?\"\n\n\"Of course. It has almost arrived now. This is the last war. Man is\n_almost_ united into one final culture--a world culture. At this point\nhe stands continent against continent, one half of the world against the\nother half. Only a single step remains, the jump to a unified culture.\nMan has climbed slowly upward, tending always toward unification of his\nculture. It will not be long--\n\n\"But it has not come yet, and so the war had to go on, to satisfy the\nlast violent surge of hatred that Man felt. Eight years have passed\nsince the war began. In these eight years, we have observed and noted\nimportant changes going on in the minds of men. Fatigue and disinterest,\nwe have seen, are gradually taking the place of hatred and fear. The\nhatred is being exhausted gradually, over a period of time. But for the\npresent, the hoax must go on, at least for a while longer. You are not\nready to learn the truth. You would want to continue the war.\"\n\n\"But how did you manage it?\" Moss asked. \"All the photographs, the\nsamples, the damaged equipment--\"\n\n\"Come over here.\" The leady directed them toward a long, low building.\n\"Work goes on constantly, whole staffs laboring to maintain a coherent\nand convincing picture of a global war.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey entered the building. Leadys were working everywhere, poring over\ntables and desks.\n\n\"Examine this project here,\" the A-class leady said. Two leadys were\ncarefully photographing something, an elaborate model on a table top.\n\"It is a good example.\"\n\nThe men grouped around, trying to see. It was a model of a ruined city.\n\nTaylor studied it in silence for a long time. At last he looked up.\n\n\"It's San Francisco,\" he said in a low voice. \"This is a model of San\nFrancisco, destroyed. I saw this on the vidscreen, piped down to us. The\nbridges were hit--\"\n\n\"Yes, notice the bridges.\" The leady traced the ruined span with his\nmetal finger, a tiny spider-web, almost invisible. \"You have no doubt\nseen photographs of this many times, and of the other tables in this\nbuilding.\n\n\"San Francisco itself is completely intact. We restored it soon after\nyou left, rebuilding the parts that had been damaged at the start of the\nwar. The work of manufacturing news goes on all the time in this\nparticular building. We are very careful to see that each part fits in\nwith all the other parts. Much time and effort are devoted to it.\"\n\nFranks touched one of the tiny model buildings, lying half in ruins. \"So\nthis is what you spend your time doing--making model cities and then\nblasting them.\"\n\n\"No, we do much more. We are caretakers, watching over the whole world.\nThe owners have left for a time, and we must see that the cities are\nkept clean, that decay is prevented, that everything is kept oiled and\nin running condition. The gardens, the streets, the water mains,\neverything must be maintained as it was eight years ago, so that when\nthe owners return, they will not be displeased. We want to be sure that\nthey will be completely satisfied.\"\n\nFranks tapped Moss on the arm.\n\n\"Come over here,\" he said in a low voice. \"I want to talk to you.\"\n\nHe led Moss and Taylor out of the building, away from the leadys,\noutside on the hillside. The soldiers followed them. The Sun was up and\nthe sky was turning blue. The air smelled sweet and good, the smell of\ngrowing things.\n\nTaylor removed his helmet and took a deep breath.\n\n\"I haven't smelled that smell for a long time,\" he said.\n\n\"Listen,\" Franks said, his voice low and hard. \"We must get back down at\nonce. There's a lot to get started on. All this can be turned to our\nadvantage.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Moss asked.\n\n\"It's a certainty that the Soviets have been tricked, too, the same as\nus. But _we_ have found out. That gives us an edge over them.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Moss nodded. \"We know, but they don't. Their Surface Council\nhas sold out, the same as ours. It works against them the same way. But\nif we could--\"\n\n\"With a hundred top-level men, we could take over again, restore things\nas they should be! It would be easy!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMoss touched him on the arm. An A-class leady was coming from the\nbuilding toward them.\n\n\"We've seen enough,\" Franks said, raising his voice. \"All this is very\nserious. It must be reported below and a study made to determine our\npolicy.\"\n\nThe leady said nothing.\n\nFranks waved to the soldiers. \"Let's go.\" He started toward the\nwarehouse.\n\nMost of the soldiers had removed their helmets. Some of them had taken\ntheir lead suits off, too, and were relaxing comfortably in their cotton\nuniforms. They stared around them, down the hillside at the trees and\nbushes, the vast expanse of green, the mountains and the sky.\n\n\"Look at the Sun,\" one of them murmured.\n\n\"It sure is bright as hell,\" another said.\n\n\"We're going back down,\" Franks said. \"Fall in by twos and follow us.\"\n\nReluctantly, the soldiers regrouped. The leadys watched without emotion\nas the men marched slowly back toward the warehouse. Franks and Moss and\nTaylor led them across the ground, glancing alertly at the leadys as\nthey walked.\n\nThey entered the warehouse. D-class leadys were loading material and\nweapons on surface carts. Cranes and derricks were working busily\neverywhere. The work was done with efficiency, but without hurry or\nexcitement.\n\nThe men stopped, watching. Leadys operating the little carts moved past\nthem, signaling silently to each other. Guns and parts were being\nhoisted by magnetic cranes and lowered gently onto waiting carts.\n\n\"Come on,\" Franks said.\n\nHe turned toward the lip of the Tube. A row of D-class leadys was\nstanding in front of it, immobile and silent. Franks stopped, moving\nback. He looked around. An A-class leady was coming toward him.\n\n\"Tell them to get out of the way,\" Franks said. He touched his gun. \"You\nhad better move them.\"\n\nTime passed, an endless moment, without measure. The men stood, nervous\nand alert, watching the row of leadys in front of them.\n\n\"As you wish,\" the A-class leady said.\n\nIt signaled and the D-class leadys moved into life. They stepped slowly\naside.\n\nMoss breathed a sigh of relief.\n\n\"I'm glad that's over,\" he said to Franks. \"Look at them all. Why don't\nthey try to stop us? They must know what we're going to do.\"\n\nFranks laughed. \"Stop us? You saw what happened when they tried to stop\nus before. They can't; they're only machines. We built them so they\ncan't lay hands on us, and they know that.\"\n\nHis voice trailed off.\n\nThe men stared at the Tube entrance. Around them the leadys watched,\nsilent and impassive, their metal faces expressionless.\n\nFor a long time the men stood without moving. At last Taylor turned\naway.\n\n\"Good God,\" he said. He was numb, without feeling of any kind.\n\nThe Tube was gone. It was sealed shut, fused over. Only a dull surface\nof cooling metal greeted them.\n\nThe Tube had been closed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFranks turned, his face pale and vacant.\n\nThe A-class leady shifted. \"As you can see, the Tube has been shut. We\nwere prepared for this. As soon as all of you were on the surface, the\norder was given. If you had gone back when we asked you, you would now\nbe safely down below. We had to work quickly because it was such an\nimmense operation.\"\n\n\"But why?\" Moss demanded angrily.\n\n\"Because it is unthinkable that you should be allowed to resume the war.\nWith all the Tubes sealed, it will be many months before forces from\nbelow can reach the surface, let alone organize a military program. By\nthat time the cycle will have entered its last stages. You will not be\nso perturbed to find your world intact.\n\n\"We had hoped that you would be undersurface when the sealing occurred.\nYour presence here is a nuisance. When the Soviets broke through, we\nwere able to accomplish their sealing without--\"\n\n\"The Soviets? They broke through?\"\n\n\"Several months ago, they came up unexpectedly to see why the war had\nnot been won. We were forced to act with speed. At this moment they are\ndesperately attempting to cut new Tubes to the surface, to resume the\nwar. We have, however, been able to seal each new one as it appears.\"\n\nThe leady regarded the three men calmly.\n\n\"We're cut off,\" Moss said, trembling. \"We can't get back. What'll we\ndo?\"\n\n\"How did you manage to seal the Tube so quickly?\" Franks asked the\nleady. \"We've been up here only two hours.\"\n\n\"Bombs are placed just above the first stage of each Tube for such\nemergencies. They are heat bombs. They fuse lead and rock.\"\n\nGripping the handle of his gun, Franks turned to Moss and Taylor.\n\n\"What do you say? We can't go back, but we can do a lot of damage, the\nfifteen of us. We have Bender guns. How about it?\"\n\nHe looked around. The soldiers had wandered away again, back toward the\nexit of the building. They were standing outside, looking at the valley\nand the sky. A few of them were carefully climbing down the slope.\n\n\"Would you care to turn over your suits and guns?\" the A-class leady\nasked politely. \"The suits are uncomfortable and you'll have no need for\nweapons. The Russians have given up theirs, as you can see.\"\n\nFingers tensed on triggers. Four men in Russian uniforms were coming\ntoward them from an aircraft that they suddenly realized had landed\nsilently some distance away.\n\n\"Let them have it!\" Franks shouted.\n\n\"They are unarmed,\" said the leady. \"We brought them here so you could\nbegin peace talks.\"\n\n\"We have no authority to speak for our country,\" Moss said stiffly.\n\n\"We do not mean diplomatic discussions,\" the leady explained. \"There\nwill be no more. The working out of daily problems of existence will\nteach you how to get along in the same world. It will not be easy, but\nit will be done.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Russians halted and they faced each other with raw hostility.\n\n\"I am Colonel Borodoy and I regret giving up our guns,\" the senior\nRussian said. \"You could have been the first Americans to be killed in\nalmost eight years.\"\n\n\"Or the first Americans to kill,\" Franks corrected.\n\n\"No one would know of it except yourselves,\" the leady pointed out. \"It\nwould be useless heroism. Your real concern should be surviving on the\nsurface. We have no food for you, you know.\"\n\nTaylor put his gun in its holster. \"They've done a neat job of\nneutralizing us, damn them. I propose we move into a city, start raising\ncrops with the help of some leadys, and generally make ourselves\ncomfortable.\" Drawing his lips tight over his teeth, he glared at the\nA-class leady. \"Until our families can come up from undersurface, it's\ngoing to be pretty lonesome, but we'll have to manage.\"\n\n\"If I may make a suggestion,\" said another Russian uneasily. \"We tried\nliving in a city. It is too empty. It is also too hard to maintain for\nso few people. We finally settled in the most modern village we could\nfind.\"\n\n\"Here in this country,\" a third Russian blurted. \"We have much to learn\nfrom you.\"\n\nThe Americans abruptly found themselves laughing.\n\n\"You probably have a thing or two to teach us yourselves,\" said Taylor\ngenerously, \"though I can't imagine what.\"\n\nThe Russian colonel grinned. \"Would you join us in our village? It would\nmake our work easier and give us company.\"\n\n\"Your village?\" snapped Franks. \"It's American, isn't it? It's ours!\"\n\nThe leady stepped between them. \"When our plans are completed, the term\nwill be interchangeable. 'Ours' will eventually mean mankind's.\" It\npointed at the aircraft, which was warming up. \"The ship is waiting.\nWill you join each other in making a new home?\"\n\nThe Russians waited while the Americans made up their minds.\n\n\"I see what the leadys mean about diplomacy becoming outmoded,\" Franks\nsaid at last. \"People who work together don't need diplomats. They solve\ntheir problems on the operational level instead of at a conference\ntable.\"\n\nThe leady led them toward the ship. \"It is the goal of history, unifying\nthe world. From family to tribe to city-state to nation to hemisphere,\nthe direction has been toward unification. Now the hemispheres will be\njoined and--\"\n\nTaylor stopped listening and glanced back at the location of the Tube.\nMary was undersurface there. He hated to leave her, even though he\ncouldn't see her again until the Tube was unsealed. But then he shrugged\nand followed the others.\n\nIf this tiny amalgam of former enemies was a good example, it wouldn't\nbe too long before he and Mary and the rest of humanity would be living\non the surface like rational human beings instead of blindly hating\nmoles.\n\n\"It has taken thousands of generations to achieve,\" the A-class leady\nconcluded. \"Hundreds of centuries of bloodshed and destruction. But each\nwar was a step toward uniting mankind. And now the end is in sight: a\nworld without war. But even that is only the beginning of a new stage of\nhistory.\"\n\n\"The conquest of space,\" breathed Colonel Borodoy.\n\n\"The meaning of life,\" Moss added.\n\n\"Eliminating hunger and poverty,\" said Taylor.\n\nThe leady opened the door of the ship. \"All that and more. How much\nmore? We cannot foresee it any more than the first men who formed a\ntribe could foresee this day. But it will be unimaginably great.\"\n\nThe door closed and the ship took off toward their new home.\n\n                                                      --PHILIP K.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
