Then he knew he\n     was being marooned on a planet of endless terrors._\n\n\nI.\n\nMoran, naturally, did not mean to help in the carrying out of the plans\nwhich would mean his destruction one way or another. The plans were\nthrashed out very painstakingly, in formal conference on the space-yacht\n_Nadine_, with Moran present and allowed to take part in the discussion.\nFrom the viewpoint of the _Nadine's_ ship's company, it was simply\nnecessary to get rid of Moran. In their predicament he might have come\nto the same conclusion; but he was not at all enthusiastic about their\ndecision. He would die of it.\n\nThe _Nadine_ was out of overdrive and all the uncountable suns of the\ngalaxy shone steadily, remotely, as infinitesimal specks of light of\nevery color of the rainbow. Two hours since, the sun of this solar\nsystem had been a vast glaring disk off to port, with streamers and\nprominences erupting about its edges. Now it lay astern, and Moran\ncould see the planet that had been chosen for his marooning. It was a\ncloudy world. There were some dim markings near one lighted limb, but\nnowhere else. There was an ice-cap in view. The rest was--clouds.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe ice-cap, by its existence and circular shape, proved that the planet\nrotated at a not unreasonable rate. The fact that it was water-ice told\nmuch. A water-ice ice-cap said that there were no poisonous gases in the\nplanet's atmosphere. Sulfur dioxide or chlorine, for example, would not\nallow the formation of water-ice. It would have to be sulphuric-acid or\nhydrochloric-acid ice. But the ice-cap was simple snow. Its size, too,\ntold about temperature-distribution on the planet. A large cap would\nhave meant a large area with arctic and sub-arctic temperatures, with\nsmall temperate and tropical climate-belts. A small one like this meant\nwide tropical and sub-tropical zones. The fact was verified by the\nthick, dense cloud-masses which covered most of the surface,--all the\nsurface, in fact, outside the ice-cap. But since there were ice-caps\nthere would be temperate regions. In short, the ice-cap proved that a\nman could endure the air and temperature conditions he would find.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMoran observed these things from the control-room of the _Nadine_, then\napproaching the world on planetary drive. He was to be left here, with\nno reason ever to expect rescue. Two of the _Nadine's_ four-man crew\nwatched out the same ports as the planet seemed to approach. Burleigh\nsaid encouragingly;\n\n\"It doesn't look too bad, Moran!\"\n\nMoran disagreed, but he did not answer. He cocked an ear instead. He\nheard something. It was a thin, wabbling, keening whine. No natural\nradiation sounds like that. Moran nodded toward the all-band speaker.\n\n\"Do you hear what I do?\" he asked sardonically.\n\nBurleigh listened. A distinctly artificial signal came out of the\nspeaker. It wasn't a voice-signal. It wasn't an identification beacon,\nsuch as are placed on certain worlds for the convenience of interstellar\nskippers who need to check their courses on extremely long runs. This\nwas something else.\n\nBurleigh said:\n\n\"Hm ... Call the others, Harper.\"\n\nHarper, prudently with him in the control-room, put his head into the\npassage leading away. He called. But Moran observed with grudging\nrespect that he didn't give him a chance to do anything drastic. These\npeople on the _Nadine_ were capable. They'd managed to recapture the\n_Nadine_ from him, but they were matter-of-fact about it. They didn't\nseem to resent what he'd tried to do, or that he'd brought them an\nindefinite distance in an indefinite direction from their last\nlanding-point, and they had still to re-locate themselves.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey'd been on Coryus Three and they'd gotten departure clearance from\nits space-port. With clearance-papers in order, they could land\nunquestioned at any other space-port and take off again--provided the\nother space-port was one they had clearance for. Without rigid control\nof space-travel, any criminal anywhere could escape the consequences of\nany crime simply by buying a ticket to another world. Moran couldn't\nhave bought a ticket, but he'd tried to get off the planet Coryus on the\n_Nadine_. The trouble was that the _Nadine_ had clearance papers\ncovering five persons aboard--four men and a girl Carol. Moran made six.\nWherever the yacht landed, such a disparity between its documents and\nits crew would spark an investigation. A lengthy, incredibly minute\ninvestigation. Moran, at least, would be picked out as a fugitive from\nCoryus Three. The others were fugitives too, from some unnamed world\nMoran did not know. They might be sent back where they came from. In\neffect, with six people on board instead of five, the _Nadine_ could not\nland anywhere for supplies. With five on board, as her papers declared,\nshe could. And Moran was the extra man whose presence would rouse\nspace-port officials' suspicion of the rest. So he had to be dumped.\n\nHe couldn't blame them. He'd made another difficulty, too. Blaster in\nhand, he'd made the _Nadine_ take off from Coryus III with a trip-tape\npicked at random for guidance. But the trip-tape had been computed for\nanother starting-point, and when the yacht came out of overdrive it was\nbecause the drive had been dismantled in the engine-room. So the ship's\nlocation was in doubt. It could have travelled at almost any speed in\npractically any direction for a length of time that was at least\nindefinite. A liner could re-locate itself without trouble. It had\nelaborate observational equipment and tri-di star-charts. But smaller\ncraft had to depend on the Galactic Directory. The process would be to\nfind a planet and check its climate and relationship to other planets,\nand its flora and fauna against descriptions in the Directory. That was\nthe way to find out where one was, when one's position became doubtful.\nThe _Nadine_ needed to make a planet-fall for this.\n\nThe rest of the ship's company came into the control-room. Burleigh\nwaved his hand at the speaker.\n\n\"Listen!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey heard it. All of them. It was a trilling, whining sound among the\ninnumerable random noises to be heard in supposedly empty space.\n\n\"That's a marker,\" Carol announced. \"I saw a costume-story tape once\nthat had that sound in it. It marked a first-landing spot on some planet\nor other, so the people could find that spot again. It was supposed to\nbe a long time ago, though.\"\n\n\"It's weak,\" observed Burleigh. \"We'll try answering it.\"\n\nMoran stirred, and he knew that every one of the others was conscious of\nthe movement. But they didn't watch him suspiciously. They were alert by\nlong habit. Burleigh said they'd been Underground people, fighting the\ngovernment of their native world, and they'd gotten away to make it seem\nthe revolt had collapsed. They'd go back later when they weren't\nexpected, and start it up again. Moran considered the story probable.\nOnly people accustomed to desperate actions would have remained so calm\nwhen Moran had used desperate measures against them.\n\nBurleigh picked up the transmitter-microphone.\n\n\"Calling ground,\" he said briskly. \"Calling ground! We pick up your\nsignal. Please reply.\"\n\nHe repeated the call, over and over and over. There was no answer.\nCracklings and hissings came out of the speaker as before, and the thin\nand reedy wabbling whine continued. The _Nadine_ went on toward the\nenlarging cloudy mass ahead.\n\nBurleigh said;\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I think,\" said Carol, \"that we should land. People have been here. If\nthey left a beacon, they may have left an identification of the planet.\nThen we'd know where we are and how to get to Loris.\"\n\nBurleigh nodded. The _Nadine_ had cleared for Loris. That was where it\nshould make its next landing. The little yacht went on. All five of its\nproper company watched as the planet's surface enlarged. The ice-cap\nwent out of sight around the bulge of the globe, but no markings\nappeared. There were cloud-banks everywhere, probably low down in the\natmosphere. The darker vague areas previously seen might have been\nhighlands.\n\n\"I think,\" said Carol, to Moran, \"that if it's too tropical where this\nsignal's coming from, we'll take you somewhere near enough to the\nice-cap to have an endurable climate. I've been figuring on food, too.\nThat will depend on where we are from Loris because we have to keep\nenough for ourselves. But we can spare some. We'll give you the\nemergency-kit, anyhow.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe emergency-kit contained antiseptics, seeds, and a weapon or two,\nwith elaborate advice to castaways. If somebody were wrecked on an even\npossibly habitable planet, the especially developed seed-strains would\nprovide food in a minimum of time. It was not an encouraging thought,\nthough, and Moran grimaced.\n\nShe hadn't said anything about being sorry that he had to be marooned.\nMaybe she was, but rebels learn to be practical or they don't live long.\nMoran wondered, momentarily, what sort of world they came from and why\nthey had revolted, and what sort of set-back to the revolt had sent the\nfive off in what they considered a strategic retreat but their\ngovernment would think defeat. Moran's own situation was perfectly\nclear.\n\nHe'd killed a man on Coryus III. His victim would not be mourned by\nanybody, and somebody formerly in very great danger would now be safe,\nwhich was the reason for what Moran had done. But the dead man had been\nvery important, and the fact that Moran had forced him to fight and\nkilled him in fair combat made no difference. Moran had needed to get\noff-planet, and fast. But space-travel regulations are especially\ndesigned to prevent such escapes.\n\nHe'd made a pretty good try, at that. One of the controls on\nspace-traffic required a ship on landing to deposit its fuel-block in\nthe space-port's vaults. The fuel-block was not returned until clearance\nfor departure had been granted. But Moran had waylaid the messenger\ncarrying the _Nadine's_ fuel-block back to that space-yacht. He'd\nknocked the messenger cold and presented himself at the yacht with the\nfuel. He was admitted. He put the block in the engine's gate. He duly\ntook the plastic receipt-token the engine only then released, and he\ndrew a blaster. He'd locked two of the _Nadine's_ crew in the\nengine-room, rushed to the control-room without encountering the others,\ndogged the door shut, and threaded in the first trip-tape to come to\nhand. He punched the take-off button and only seconds later the\noverdrive. Then the yacht--and Moran--was away. But his present\ncompanions got the drive dismantled two days later and once the yacht\nwas out of overdrive they efficiently gave him his choice of\nsurrendering or else. He surrendered, stipulating that he wouldn't be\nlanded back on Coryus; he still clung to hope of avoiding return--which\nwas almost certain anyhow. Because nobody would want to go back to a\nplanet from which they'd carried away a criminal, even though they'd\ndone it unwillingly. Investigation of such a matter might last for\nmonths.\n\nNow the space-yacht moved toward a vast mass of fleecy whiteness without\nany visible features. Harper stayed with the direction-finder. From time\nto time he gave readings requiring minute changes of course. The\nwabbling, whining signal was louder now. It became louder than all the\nrest of the space-noises together.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe yacht touched atmosphere and Burleigh said;\n\n\"Watch our height, Carol.\"\n\nShe stood by the echometer. Sixty miles. Fifty. Thirty. A correction of\ncourse. Fifteen miles to surface below. Ten. Five. At twenty-five\nthousand feet there were clouds, which would be particles of ice so\nsmall that they floated even so high. Then clear air, then lower clouds,\nand lower ones still. It was not until six thousand feet above the\nsurface that the planet-wide cloud-level seemed to begin. From there on\ndown it was pure opacity. Anything could exist in that dense, almost\npalpable grayness. There could be jagged peaks.\n\nThe _Nadine_ went down and down. At fifteen hundred feet above the\nunseen surface, the clouds ended. Below, there was only haze. One could\nsee the ground, at least, but there was no horizon. There was only an\nend to visibility. The yacht descended as if in the center of a sphere\nin which one could see clearly nearby, less clearly at a little\ndistance, and not at all beyond a quarter-mile or so.\n\nThere was a shaded, shadowless twilight under the cloud-bank. The ground\nlooked like no ground ever seen before by anyone. Off to the right a\nrivulet ran between improbable-seeming banks. There were a few very\nsmall hills of most unlikely appearance. It was the ground, the matter\non which one would walk, which was strangest. It had color, but the\ncolor was not green. Much of it was a pallid, dirty-yellowish white. But\nthere were patches of blue, and curious veinings of black, and here and\nthere were other colors, all of them unlike the normal color of\nvegetation on a planet with a sol-type sun.\n\nHarper spoke from the direction-finder;\n\n\"The signal's coming from that mound, yonder.\"\n\nThere was a hillock of elongated shape directly in line with the\n_Nadine's_ course in descent. Except for the patches of color, it was\nthe only considerable landmark within the half-mile circle in which\nanything could be seen at all.\n\nThe _Nadine_ checked her downward motion. Interplanetary drive is rugged\nand sure, but it does not respond to fine adjustment. Burleigh used\nrockets, issuing great bellowings of flame, to make actual contact. The\nyacht hovered, and as the rocket-flames diminished slowly she sat down\nwith practically no impact at all. But around her there was a monstrous\ntumult of smoke and steam. When the rockets went off, she lay in a\nburned-out hollow some three or four feet deep with a bottom of solid\nstone. The walls of the hollow were black and scorched. It seemed that\nat some places they quivered persistently.\n\nThere was silence in the control-room save for the whining noise which\nnow was almost deafening. Harper snapped off the switch. Then there was\ntrue silence. The space-yacht had come to rest possibly a hundred yards\nfrom the mound which was the source of the space-signal. That mound\nshared the peculiarity of the ground as far as they could see through\nthe haze. It was not vegetation in any ordinary sense. Certainly it was\nno mineral surface! The landing-pockets had burned away three or four\nfeet of it, and the edge of the burned area smoked noisesomely, and\nsomehow it looked as if it would reek. And there were places where it\nstirred.\n\nBurleigh blinked and stared. Then he reached up and flicked on the\noutside microphones. Instantly there was bedlam. If the landscape was\nstrange, here, the sounds that came from it were unbelievable.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were grunting noises. There were clickings, uncountable clickings\nthat made a background for all the rest. There were discordant howls and\nhonkings. From time to time some thing unknown made a cry that sounded\nvery much like a small boy trailing a stick against a picket fence, only\nmuch louder. Something hooted, maintaining the noise for an impossibly\nlong time. And persistently, sounding as if they came from far away,\nthere were booming noises, unspeakably deep-bass, made by something\nalive. And something shrieked in lunatic fashion and something else\nstill moaned from time to time with the volume of a steam-whistle....\n\n\"This sounds and looks like a nice place to live,\" said Moran with fine\nirony.\n\nBurleigh did not answer. He turned down the outside sound.\n\n\"What's that stuff there, the ground?\" he demanded. \"We burned it away\nin landing. I've seen something like it somewhere, but never taking the\nplace of grass!\"\n\n\"That,\" said Moran as if brightly, \"that's what I'm to make a garden in.\nOf evenings I'll stroll among my thrifty plantings and listen to the\ndelightful sounds of nature.\"\n\nBurleigh scowled. Harper flicked off the direction-finder.\n\n\"The signal still comes from that hillock yonder,\" he said with\nfinality.\n\nMoran said bitingly;\n\n\"That ain't no hillock, that's my home!\"\n\nThen, instantly he'd said it, he recognized that it could be true. The\nmound was not a fold in the ground. It was not an up-cropping of the\nash-covered stone on which the _Nadine_ rested. The enigmatic,\ndirty-yellow-dirty-red-dirty-blue-and-dirty-black ground-cover hid\nsomething. It blurred the shape it covered, very much as enormous\ncobwebs made solid and opaque would have done. But when one looked\ncarefully at the mound, there was a landing-fin sticking up toward the\nleaden skies. It was attached to a large cylindrical object of which the\nfore part was crushed in. The other landing-fins could be traced.\n\n\"It's a ship,\" said Moran curtly. \"It crash-landed and its crew set up a\nsignal to call for help. None came, or they'd have turned the beacon\noff. Maybe they got the lifeboats to work and got away. Maybe they lived\nas I'm expected to live until they died as I'm expected to die.\"\n\nBurleigh said angrily;\n\n\"You'd do what we are doing if you were in our shoes!\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Moran, \"but a man can gripe, can't he?\"\n\n\"You won't have to live here,\" said Burleigh. \"We'll take you somewhere\nup by the ice-cap. As Carol said, we'll give you everything we can\nspare. And meanwhile we'll take a look at that wreck yonder. There might\nbe an indication in it of what solar system this is. There could be\nsomething in it of use to you, too. You'd better come along when we\nexplore.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" said Moran with irony. \"Very kind of you, sir. You'll\ngo armed, sir?\"\n\nBurleigh growled;\n\n\"Naturally!\"\n\n\"Then since I can't be trusted with a weapon,\" said Moran, \"I suggest\nthat I take a torch. We may have to burn through that loathesome stuff\nto get in the ship.\"\n\n\"Right,\" growled Burleigh again. \"Brawn and Carol, you'll keep ship. The\nrest of us wear suits. We don't know what that stuff is outside.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMoran silently went to the space-suit rack and began to get into a\nsuit. Modern space-suits weren't like the ancient crudities with bulging\nmetal casings and enormous globular helmets. Non-stretch fabrics took\nthe place of metal, and constant-volume joints were really practical\nnowadays. A man could move about in a late-model space-suit almost as\neasily as in ship-clothing. The others of the landing-party donned their\nspecial garments with the brisk absence of fumbling that these people\ndisplayed in every action.\n\n\"If there's a lifeboat left,\" said Carol suddenly, \"Moran might be able\nto do something with it.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes!\" said Moran. \"It's very likely that the ship hit hard enough\nto kill everybody aboard, but not smash the boats!\"\n\n\"Somebody survived the crash,\" said Burleigh, \"because they set up a\nbeacon. I wouldn't count on a boat, Moran.\"\n\n\"I don't!\" snapped Moran.\n\nHe flipped the fastener of his suit. He felt all the openings catch. He\nsaw the others complete their equipment. They took arms. So far they had\nseen no moving thing outside, but arms were simple sanity on an unknown\nworld. Moran, though, would not be permitted a weapon. He picked up a\ntorch. They filed into the airlock. The inner door closed. The outer\ndoor opened. It was not necessary to check the air specifically. The\nsuits would take care of that. Anyhow the ice-cap said there were no\nwater-soluble gases in the atmosphere, and a gas can't be an active\npoison if it can't dissolve.\n\nThey filed out of the airlock. They stood on ash-covered stone, only\nslightly eroded by the processes which made life possible on this\nplanet. They looked dubiously at the scorched, indefinite substance\nwhich had been ground before the _Nadine_ landed. Moran moved scornfully\nforward. He kicked at the burnt stuff. His foot went through the char.\nThe hole exposed a cheesy mass of soft matter which seemed riddled with\nsmall holes.\n\nSomething black came squirming frantically out of one of the openings.\nIt was eight or ten inches long. It had a head, a thorax, and an\nabdomen. It had wing-cases. It had six legs. It toppled down to the\nstone on which the _Nadine_ rested. Agitatedly, it spread its\nwing-covers and flew away, droning loudly. The four men heard the sound\nabove even the monstrous cacophony of cries and boomings and grunts and\nsqueaks which seemed to fill the air.\n\n\"What the devil--.\"\n\nMoran kicked again. More holes. More openings. More small tunnels in the\ncheese-like, curd-like stuff. More black things squirming to view in\nobvious panic. They popped out everywhere. It was suddenly apparent\nthat the top of the soil, here, was a thick and blanket-like sheet over\nthe whitish stuff. The black creatures lived and thrived in tunnels\nunder it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCarol's voice came over the helmet-phones.\n\n\"_They're--bugs!_\" she said incredulously. \"_They're beetles! They're\ntwenty times the size of the beetles we humans have been carrying around\nthe galaxy, but that's what they are!_\"\n\nMoran grunted. Distastefully, he saw his predicament made worse. He knew\nwhat had happened here. He could begin to guess at other things to be\ndiscovered. It had not been practical for men to move onto new planets\nand subsist upon the flora and fauna they found there. On some new\nplanets life had never gotten started. On such worlds a highly complex\noperation was necessary before humanity could move in. A complete\necological complex had to be built up; microbes to break down the rock\nfor soil, bacteria to fix nitrogen to make the soil fertile; plants to\ngrow in the new-made dirt and insects to fertilize the plants so they\nwould multiply, and animals and birds to carry the seeds planet-wide. On\nmost planets, to be sure, there were local, aboriginal plants and\nanimals. But still terrestrial creatures had to be introduced if a\ncolony was to feed itself. Alien plants did not supply satisfactory\nfood. So an elaborate adaptation job had to be done on every planet\nbefore native and terrestrial living things settled down together. It\nwasn't impossible that the scuttling things were truly beetles, grown\nlarge and monstrous under the conditions of a new planet. And the\nground....\n\n\"This ground stuff,\" said Moran distastefully, \"is yeast or some sort of\ntoadstool growth. This is a seedling world. It didn't have any life on\nit, so somebody dumped germs and spores and bugs to make it ready for\nplants and animals eventually. But nobody's come back to finish up the\njob.\"\n\nBurleigh grunted a somehow surprised assent. But it wasn't surprising;\nnot wholly so. Once one mentioned yeasts and toadstools and fungi\ngenerally, the weird landscape became less than incredible. But it\nremained actively unpleasant to think of being marooned on it.\n\n\"Suppose we go look at the ship?\" said Moran unpleasantly. \"Maybe you\ncan find out where you are, and I can find out what's ahead of me.\"\n\nHe climbed up on the unscorched surface. It was elastic. The\nparchment-like top skin yielded. It was like walking on a mass of\nsprings.\n\n\"We'd better spread out,\" added Moran, \"or else we'll break through that\nskin and be floundering in this mess.\"\n\n\"I'm giving the orders, Moran!\" said Burleigh shortly. \"But what you say\ndoes make sense.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe and the others joined Moran on the yielding surface. Their footing\nwas uncertain, as on a trampoline. They staggered. They moved toward the\nhillock which was a covered-over wrecked ship.\n\nThe ground was not as level as it appeared from the _Nadine's_\ncontrol-room. There were undulations. But they could not see more than a\nquarter-mile in any direction. Beyond that was mist. But Burleigh, at\none end of the uneven line of advancing men, suddenly halted and stood\nstaring down at something he had not seen before. The others halted.\n\nSomething moved. It came out from behind a very minor spire of whitish\nstuff that looked like a dirty sheet stretched over a tall stone. The\nthing that appeared was very peculiar indeed. It was a--worm. But it was\na foot thick and ten feet long, and it had a group of stumpy legs at its\nfore end--where there were eyes hidden behind bristling hair-like\ngrowths--and another set of feet at its tail end. It progressed sedately\nby reaching forward with its fore-part, securing a foothold, and then\narching its middle portion like a cat arching its back, to bring its\nhind part forward. Then it reached forward again. It was of a dark olive\ncolor from one end to the other. Its manner of walking was insane but\nsomehow sedate.\n\nMoran heard muffled noises in his helmet-phone as the others tried to\nspeak. Carol's voice came anxiously;\n\n\"_What's the matter? What do you see?_\"\n\nMoran said with savage precision;\n\n\"We're looking at an inch-worm, grown up like the beetles only more so.\nIt's not an inch-worm any longer. It's a yard-worm.\" Then he said\nharshly to the men with him; \"It's not a hunting creature on worlds\nwhere it's smaller. It's not likely to have turned deadly here. Come\non!\"\n\nHe went forward over the singularly bouncy ground. The others followed.\nIt was to be noted that Hallet the engineer, avoided the huge harmless\ncreature more widely than most.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey reached the mound which was the ship. Moran unlimbered his torch.\nHe said sardonically;\n\n\"This ship won't do anybody any good. It's old-style. That thick belt\naround its middle was dropped a hundred years ago, and more.\" There was\nan abrupt thickening of the cylindrical hull at the middle. There was an\nequally abrupt thinning, again, toward the landing-fins. The sharpness\nof the change was blurred over by the revolting ground-stuff growing\neverywhere. \"We're going to find that this wreck has been here a century\nat least!\"\n\nWithout orders, he turned on the torch. A four-foot flame of pure\nblue-white leaped out. He touched its tip to the fungoid soil. Steam\nleaped up. He used the flame like a gigantic scalpel, cutting a square a\nyard deep in the whitish stuff, and then cutting it across and across to\ndestroy it. Thick fumes arose, and quiverings and shakings began. Black\ncreatures in their labyrinths of tunnels began to panic. Off to the\nright the blanket-like surface ripped and they poured out. They scuttled\ncrazily here and there. Some took to wing. By instinct the other\nmen--the armed ones--moved back from the smoke. They wore space-helmets\nbut they felt that there should be an intolerable smell.\n\nMoran slashed and slashed angrily with the big flame, cutting a way to\nthe metal hull that had fallen here before his grandfather was born.\nSometimes the flame cut across things that writhed, and he was sickened.\nBut above all he raged because he was to be marooned here. He could not\naltogether blame the others. They couldn't land at any colonized world\nwith him on board without his being detected as an extra member of the\ncrew. His fate would then be sealed. But they also would be\ninvestigated. Official queries would go across this whole sector of the\ngalaxy, naming five persons of such-and-such description and\nsuch-and-such fingerprints, voyaging in a space-yacht of such-and-such\nsize and registration. The world they came from would claim them as\nfugitives. They would be returned to it. They'd be executed.\n\nThen Carol's voice came in his helmet-phone. She cried out;\n\n\"_Look out! It's coming! Kill it! Kill it--._\"\n\nHe heard blast-rifles firing. He heard Burleigh pant commands. He was on\nhis way out of the hollow he'd carved when he heard Harper cry out\nhorribly.\n\nHe got clear of the newly burned-away stuff. There was still much smoke\nand stream. But he saw Harper. More, he saw the thing that had Harper.\n\nIt occurred to him instantly that if Harper died, there would not be too\nmany people on the _Nadine_. They need not maroon him. In fact, they\nwouldn't dare.\n\nA ship that came in to port with two few on board would be investigated\nas thoroughly as one that had too many. Perhaps more thoroughly. So if\nHarper were killed, Moran would be needed to take his place. He'd go on\nfrom here in the _Nadine_, necessarily accepted as a member of her crew.\n\nThen he rushed, the flame-torch making a roaring sound.\n\n\nII.\n\nThey went back to the _Nadine_ for weapons more adequate for\nencountering the local fauna when it was over. Blast-rifles were not\neffective against such creatures as these. Torches were contact weapons\nbut they killed. Blast-rifles did not. And Harper needed to pull himself\ntogether again, too. Also, neither Moran nor any of the others wanted to\ngo back to the still un-entered wreck while the skinny, somehow\ndisgusting legs of the thing still kicked spasmodically--quite\nseparate--on the whitish ground-stuff. Moran had disliked such creatures\nin miniature form on other worlds. Enlarged like this.\n\nIt seemed insane that such creatures, even in miniature, should\npainstakingly be brought across light-years of space to the new worlds\nmen settled on. But it had been found to be necessary. The ecological\nsystem in which human beings belonged had turned out to be infinitely\ncomplicated. It had turned out, in fact, to be the ecological system of\nEarth, and unless all parts of the complex were present, the total was\nsubtly or glaringly wrong. So mankind distastefully ferried pests as\nwell as useful creatures to its new worlds as they were made ready for\nsettlement. Mosquitos throve on the inhabited globes of the Rim Stars.\nRoaches twitched nervous antennae on the settled planets of the\nCoal-sack. Dogs on Antares had fleas, and scratched their bites, and\nhumanity spread through the galaxy with an attendant train of insects\nand annoyances. If they left their pests behind, the total system of\nchecks and balances which make life practical would get lopsided. It\nwould not maintain itself. The vagaries that could result were admirably\nillustrated in and on the landscape outside the _Nadine_. Something had\nbeen left out of the seeding of this planet. The element--which might be\na bacterium or a virus or almost anything at all--the element that kept\ncreatures at the size called \"normal\" was either missing or inoperable\nhere. The results were not desirable.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHarper drank thirstily. Carol had watched from the control-room. She was\nstill pale. She looked strangely at Moran.\n\n\"You're sure it didn't get through your suit?\" Burleigh asked\ninsistently of Harper.\n\nMoran said sourly;\n\n\"The creatures have changed size. There's no proof they've changed\nanything else. Beetles live in tunnels they make in fungus growths. The\nbeetles and the tunnels are larger, but that's all. Inchworms travel as\nthey always did. They move yards instead of inches, but that's all.\nCentipedes--\"\n\n\"It was--\" said Carol unsteadily. \"It was thirty feet long!\"\n\n\"Centipedes,\" repeated Moran, \"catch prey with their legs. They always\ndid. Some of them trail poison from their feet. We can play a blowtorch\nover Harper's suit and any poison will be burned away. You can't burn a\nspace-suit!\"\n\n\"We certainly can't leave Moran here!\" said Burleigh uneasily.\n\n\"He kept Harper from being killed!\" said Carol. \"Your blast-rifles\nweren't any good. The--creatures are hard to kill.\"\n\n\"Very hard to kill,\" agreed Moran. \"But I'm not supposed to kill them.\nI'm supposed to live with them! I wonder how we can make them understand\nthey're not supposed to kill me either?\"\n\n\"I'll admit,\" said Burleigh, \"that if you'd let Harper get killed, we'd\nhave been forced to let you take his identity and not be marooned, to\navoid questions at the space-port on Loris. Not many men would have done\nwhat you did.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm a hero,\" said Moran. \"Noble Moran, that's me! What the hell\nwould you want me to do? I didn't think! I won't do it again. I\npromise!\"\n\nThe last statement was almost true. Moran felt a squeamish horror at the\nmemory of what he'd been through over by the wrecked ship. He'd come\nrunning out of the excavation he'd made. He had for weapon a four-foot\nblue-white flame, and there was a monstrous creature running directly\ntoward him, with Harper lifted off the ground and clutched in two\ngigantic, spidery legs. It was no less than thirty feet long, but it was\na centipede. It travelled swiftly on grisly, skinny, pipe-thin legs. It\nloomed over Moran as he reached the surface and he automatically thrust\nthe flame at it. The result was shocking. But the nervous systems of\ninsects are primitive. It is questionable that they feel pain. It is\ncertain that separated parts of them act as if they had independent\nlife. Legs--horrible things--sheared off in the flame of the torch, but\nthe grisly furry thing rushed on until Moran slashed across its body\nwith the blue-white fire. Then it collapsed. But Harper was still held\nfirmly and half the monster struggled mindlessly to run on while\nanother part was dead. Moran fought it almost hysterically, slicing off\nlegs and wanting to be sick when their stumps continued to move as if\npurposefully, and the legs themselves kicked and writhed rhythmically.\nBut he bored in and cut at the body and ultimately dragged Harper clear.\n\nAfterward, sickened, he completed cutting it to bits with the torch. But\neach part continued nauseatingly to move. He went back with the others\nto the _Nadine_. The blast-rifles had been almost completely without\neffect upon the creature because of its insensitive nervous system.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I think,\" said Burleigh, \"that it is only fair for us to lift from here\nand find a better part of this world to land Moran in.\"\n\n\"Why not another planet?\" asked Carol.\n\n\"It could take weeks,\" said Burleigh harassedly. \"We left Coryus three\ndays ago. We ought to land on Loris before too long. There'd be\nquestions asked if we turned up weeks late! We can't afford that! The\nspace-port police would suspect us of all sorts of things. They might\ndecide to check back on us where we came from. We can't take the time to\nhunt another planet!\"\n\n\"Then your best bet,\" said Moran caustically, \"is to find out where we\nare. You may be so far from Loris that you can't make port without\nraising questions anyhow. But you might be almost on course. I don't\nknow! But let's see if that wreck can tell us. I'll go by myself if you\nlike.\"\n\nHe went into the airlock, where his suit and the others had been sprayed\nwith a corrosive solution while the outside air was pumped out and new\nair from inside the yacht admitted. He got into the suit. Harper joined\nhim.\n\n\"I'm going with you,\" he said shortly. \"Two will be safer than\none,--both with torches.\"\n\n\"Too, too true!\" said Moran sardonically.\n\nHe bundled the other suits out of the airlock and into the ship. He\nchecked his torch. He closed the inner lock door and started the pump.\nHarper said;\n\n\"I'm not going to try to thank you--.\"\n\n\"Because,\" Moran snapped, \"you wouldn't have been on this planet to be\nin danger if I hadn't tried to capture the yacht. I know it!\"\n\n\"That wasn't what I meant to say!\" protested Harper.\n\nMoran snarled at him. The lock-pump stopped and the ready-for exit light\nglowed. They pushed open the outer door and emerged. Again there was the\ndiscordant, almost intolerable din. It made no sense. The cries and\ncalls and stridulations they now knew to be those of insects had no\nsignificance. The unseen huge creatures made them without purpose.\nInsects do not challenge each other like birds or make mating-calls like\nanimals. They make noises because it is their nature. The noises have no\nmeaning. The two men started toward the wreck to which Moran had partly\nburned a passageway. There were clickings from underfoot all around\nthem. Moran said abruptly;\n\n\"Those clicks come from the beetles in their tunnels underfoot. They're\npractically a foot long. How big do you suppose bugs grow here,--and\nwhy?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHarper did not answer. He carried a flame-torch like the one Moran had\nused before. They went unsteadily over the elastic, yielding stuff\nunderfoot. Harper halted, to look behind. Carol's voice came in the\nhelmet-phones.\n\n\"_We're watching out for you. We'll try to warn you if--anything shows\nup._\"\n\n\"Better watch me!\" snapped Moran. \"If I should kill Harper after all,\nyou might have to pass me for him presently!\"\n\nHe heard a small, inarticulate sound, as if Carol protested. Then he\nheard an angry shrill whine. He'd turned aside from the direct line to\nthe wreck. Something black, the size of a fair-sized dog, faced him\nbelligerently. Multiple lensed eyes, five inches across, seemed to\nregard him in a peculiarly daunting fashion. The creature had a narrow,\nunearthly, triangular face, with mandibles that worked from side to side\ninstead of up and down like an animal's jaws. The head was utterly\nunlike any animal such as breed and raise their young and will fight for\nthem. There was a small thorax, from which six spiny, glistening legs\nsprang. There was a bulbous abdomen.\n\n\"This,\" said Moran coldly, \"is an ant. I've stepped on them for no\nreason, and killed them. I've probably killed many times as many without\nknowing it. But this could kill me.\"\n\nThe almost yard-long enormity standing two and a half feet high, was in\nthe act of carrying away a section of one of the legs of the giant\ncentipede Moran had killed earlier. It still moved. The leg was many\ntimes the size of the ant. Moran moved toward it. It made a louder\nbuzzing sound, threatening him.\n\nMoran cut it apart with a slashing sweep of the flame that a\nfinger-touch sent leaping from his torch. The thing presumably died, but\nit continued to writhe senselessly.\n\n\"I killed this one,\" said Moran savagely, \"because I remembered\nsomething from my childhood. When one ant finds something to eat and\ncan't carry it all away, it brings back its friends to get the rest.\nThe big thing I killed would be such an item. How'd you like to have a\nhorde of these things about us? Come on!\"\n\nThrough his helmet-phone he heard Harper breathing harshly. He led the\nway once more toward the wreck.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBlack beetles swarmed about when he entered the cut in the mould-yeast\nsoil. They popped out of tunnels as if in astonishment that what had\nbeen subterranean passages suddenly opened to the air. Harper stepped on\none, and it did not crush. It struggled frantically and he almost fell.\nHe gasped. Two of the creatures crawled swiftly up the legs of Moran's\nsuit, and he knocked them savagely away. He found himself grinding his\nteeth in invincible revulsion.\n\nThey reached the end of the cut he'd made in the fungus-stuff. Metal\nshowed past burned-away soil. Moran growled;\n\n\"You keep watch. I'll finish the cut.\"\n\nThe flame leaped out. Dense clouds of smoke and steam poured out and up.\nWith the intolerably bright light of the torch overwhelming the\nperpetual grayness under the clouds and playing upon curling vapors, the\ntwo space-suited men looked like figures in some sort of inferno.\n\nCarol's voice came anxiously into Moran's helmet-phone;\n\n\"_Are you all right?_\"\n\n\"So far, both of us,\" said Moran sourly. \"I've just uncovered the crack\nof an airlock door.\"\n\nHe swept the flame around again. A mass of undercut fungus toppled\ntoward him. He burned it and went on. He swept the flame more widely.\nThere was carbonized matter from the previously burned stuff on the\nmetal, but he cleared all the metal. Carol's voice again;\n\n\"_There's something flying.... It's huge! It's a wasp!\nIt's--monstrous!_\"\n\nMoran growled;\n\n\"Harper, we're in a sort of trench. If it hovers, you'll burn it as it\ncomes down. Cut through its waist. It won't crawl toward us along the\ntrench. It'd have to back toward us to use its sting.\"\n\nHe burned and burned, white light glaring upon a mass of steam and smoke\nwhich curled upward and looked as if lightning-flashes played within it.\n\nCarol's voice;\n\n\"_It--went on past.... It was as big as a cow!_\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMoran wrenched at the port-door. It partly revolved. He pulled. It fell\noutward. The wreck was not standing upright on its fins. It lay on its\nside. The lock inside the toppled-out port was choked with a horrible\nmass of thread-like fungi. Moran swept the flame in. The fungus\nshriveled and was not. He opened the inner lock-door. There was pure\nblackness within. He held the torch for light.\n\nFor an instant everything was confusion, because the wreck was lying on\nits side instead of standing in a normal position. Then he saw a sheet\nof metal, propped up to be seen instantly by anyone entering the wrecked\nspace-vessel.\n\nLetters burned into the metal gave a date a century and a half old.\nStraggly torch-writing said baldly;\n\n     \"_This ship the Malabar crashed here on Tethys II a week ago. We\n     cannot repair. We are going on to Candida III in the boats. We are\n     carrying what bessendium we can with us. We resign salvage rights\n     in this ship to its finders, but we have more bessendium with us.\n     We will give that to our rescuers._\n\n     \"_Jos. White, Captain._\"\n\nMoran made a peculiar, sardonic sound like a bark.\n\n\"Calling the _Nadine_!\" he said in mirthless amusement. \"This planet is\nTethys Two. Do you read me? Tethys II! Look it up!\"\n\nA pause. Then Carol's voice, relieved;\n\n\"_Tethys is in the Directory! That's good!_\" There was the sound of\nmurmurings in the control-room behind her. \"_Yes!... Oh,--wonderful!\nIt's not far off the course we should have followed! We won't be\nsuspiciously late at Loris! Wonderful!_\"\n\n\"I share your joy,\" said Moran sarcastically. \"More information! The\nship's name was the _Malabar_. She carried bessendium among her cargo.\nHer crew went on to Candida III a hundred and fifty years ago, leaving a\npromise to pay in more bessendium whoever should rescue them. More\nbessendium! Which suggests that some bessendium was left behind.\"\n\nSilence. The bald memorandum left behind the vanished crew was, of\ncourse, pure tragedy. A ship's lifeboat could travel four light-years,\nor possibly even six. But there were limits. A castaway crew had left\nthis world on a desperate journey to another in the hope that life there\nwould be tolerable. If they arrived, they waited for some other ship to\ncross the illimitable emptiness and discover either the beacon here or\none they'd set up on the other world. The likelihood was small, at best.\nIt had worked out zero. If the lifeboats made Candida III, their crews\nstayed there because they could go no farther. They'd died there,\nbecause if they'd been found this ship would have been visited and its\ncargo salvaged.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMoran went inside. He climbed through the compartments of the toppled\ncraft, using his torch for light. He found where the cargo-hold had been\nopened from the living part of the ship. He saw the cargo. There were\nsmall, obviously heavy boxes in one part of the hold. Some had been\nbroken open. He found scraps of purple bessendium ore dropped while\nbeing carried to the lifeboats. A century and a half ago it had not\nseemed worth while to pick them up, though bessendium was the most\nprecious material in the galaxy. It couldn't be synthesized. It had to\nbe made by some natural process not yet understood, but involving\nlong-continued pressures of megatons to the square inch with\ntemperatures in the millions of degrees. It was purple. It was\ncrystalline. Fractions of it in blocks of other metals made the\nfuel-blocks that carried liners winging through the void. But here were\npounds of it dropped carelessly....\n\nMoran gathered a double handful. He slipped it in a pocket of his\nspace-suit. He went clambering back to the lock.\n\nHe heard the roaring of a flame-torch. He found Harper playing it\nsqueamishly on the wriggling fragments of another yard-long ant. It had\nexplored the trench burned out of the fungus soil and down to the rock.\nHarper'd killed it as it neared him.\n\n\"That's three of them I've killed,\" said Harper in a dogged voice.\n\"There seem to be more.\"\n\n\"Did you hear my news?\" asked Moran sardonically.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Harper. \"How'll we get back to the _Nadine_?\"\n\n\"Oh, we'll fight our way through,\" said Moran, as sardonically as\nbefore. \"We'll practice splendid heroism, giving battle to ants who\nthink we're other ants trying to rob them of some fragments of an\nover-sized dead centipede. A splendid cause to fight for, Harper!\"\n\nHe felt an almost overpowering sense of irony. The quantity of\nbessendium he'd seen was riches incalculable. The mere pocketfull of\ncrystals in his pocket would make any man wealthy if he could get to a\nsettled planet and sell them. And there was much, much more back in the\ncargo-hold of the wreck. He'd seen it.\n\nBut his own situation was unchanged. Bessendium could be hidden\nsomehow,--perhaps between the inner and outer hulls of the _Nadine_. But\nit was not possible to land the _Nadine_ at any space-port with an extra\nman aboard her. In a sense, Moran might be one of the richest men in the\ngalaxy in his salvagers' right to the treasure in the wrecked\n_Malabar's_ hold. But he could not use that treasure to buy his way to\na landing on a colonized world.\n\nCarol's voice; she was frightened.\n\n\"_Something's coming! It's--terribly big! It's coming out of the mist!_\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMoran pushed past Harper in the trench that ended at the wreck's\nlock-door. He moved on until he could see over the edge of that trench\nas it shallowed. Now there were not less than forty of the giant ants\nabout the remnants of the monstrous centipede Moran had killed. They\nmoved about in great agitation. There was squabbling. Angry, whining\nstridulations filled the air beneath the louder and more gruesome sounds\nfrom fartheraway places. It appeared that scouts and foragers from two\ndifferent ant-cities had come upon the treasure of dead--if\ntwitching--meat of Moran's providing. They differed about where the\nnoisesome booty should be taken. Some ants pulled angrily against each\nother, whining shrilly. He saw individual ants running frantically away\nin two different directions. They would be couriers, carrying news of\nwhat amounted to a frontier incident in the city-state civilization of\nthe ants.\n\nThen Moran saw the giant thing of which Carol spoke. It was truly huge,\nand it had a gross, rounded body, and a ridiculously small thorax, and\nits head was tiny and utterly mild in expression. It walked with an\nenormous, dainty deliberation, placing small spiked feet at the end of\nfifteen-foot legs very delicately in place as it moved. Its eyes were\nmultiple and huge, and its forelegs though used so deftly for walking\nhad a horrifying set of murderous, needle-sharp saw-teeth along their\nedges.\n\nIt looked at the squabbling ants with its gigantic eyes that somehow\nappeared like dark glasses worn by a monstrosity. It moved primly,\nprecisely toward them. Two small black creatures tugged at a hairy\nsection of a giant centipede's leg. The great pale-green creature--a\nmantis; a praying mantis twenty feet tall in its giraffe-like walking\nposition--the great creature loomed over them, looking down as through\nsunglasses. A foreleg moved like lightning. An ant weighing nearly as\nmuch as a man stridulated shrilly, terribly, as it was borne aloft. The\nmantis closed its arm-like forelegs upon it, holding it as if piously\nand benignly contemplating it. Then it ate it, very much as a man might\neat an apple, without regard to the convulsive writhings of its victim.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt moved on toward the denser fracas among the ants. Suddenly it raised\nits ghastly saw-toothed forelegs in an extraordinary gesture. It was the\nmantis's spectral attitude, which seemed a pose of holding out its arms\nin benediction. But its eyes remained blind-seeming and\nenigmatic,--again like dark glasses.\n\nThen it struck. Daintily, it dined upon an ant. Upon another. Upon\nanother and another and another.\n\nFrom one direction parties of agitated and hurrying black objects\nappeared at the edge of the mist. They were ants of a special\ncaste,--warrior-ants with huge mandibles designed for fighting in\ndefense of their city and its social system and its claim to fragments\nof dead centipedes. From another direction other parties of no less\ntruculent warriors moved with the swiftness and celerity of a striking\ntask-force. All the air was filled with the deep-bass notes of something\nhuge, booming beyond visibility, and the noises as of sticks trailed\nagainst picket fences, and hootings which were produced by the rubbing\nof serrated leg-joints against chitinous diaphragms. But now a new\ntumult arose.\n\nFrom forty disputatious _formicidae_, whining angrily at each other over\nthe stinking remains of the monster Moran had killed, the number of ants\ninvolved in the quarrel became hundreds. But more and more arrived. The\nspecial caste of warriors bred for warfare was not numerous enough to\ntake care of the provocative behavior of foreign foragers. There was a\ngeneral mobilization in both unseen ant-city states. They became nations\nin arms. Their populations rushed to the scene of conflict. The burrows\nand dormitories and eating-chambers of the underground nations were\nswept clean of occupants. Only the nurseries retained a skeleton staff\nof nurses--the nurseries and the excavated palace occupied by the\nant-queen and her staff of servants and administrators. All the\nresources of two populous ant-nations were flung into the fray.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom a space of a hundred yards or less, containing mere dozens of\nbelligerent squabblers, the dirty-white ground of the fungus-plain\nbecame occupied by hundreds of snapping, biting combatants. They\ncovered--they fought over--the half of an acre. There were contending\nbattalions fighting as masses in the center, while wings of fighting\ncreatures to right and left were less solidly arranged. But\nreinforcements poured out of the mist from two directions, and momently\nthe situation changed. Presently the battle covered an acre. Groups of\nfresh fighters arriving from the city to the right uttered shrill\nstridulations and charged upon the flank of their enemies.\nSimultaneously, reinforcements from the city to the left flung\nthemselves into the fighting-line near the center.\n\nFormations broke up. The battle disintegrated into an indefinite number\nof lesser combats; troops or regiments fighting together often moved\nahead with an appearance of invincibility, but suddenly they broke and\nbroke again until there was only a complete confusion of unorganized\nsingle combats in which the fighters rolled over and over, struggling\nferociously with mandible and claw to destroy each other. Presently the\nbattle raged over five acres. Ten. Thousands upon thousands of black,\nglistening, stinking creatures tore at each other in murderous ferocity.\nWhining, squealing battle-cries arose and almost drowned out the deeper\nnotes of larger but invisible creatures off in the mist.\n\nMoran and Harper got back to the _Nadine_ by a wide detour past warriors\npreoccupied with each other just before the battle reached its most\nsavage stage. In that stage, the space-yacht was included in the\nbattleground. Fights went on about its landing-fins. Horrifying duels\ncould be followed by scrapings and bumpings against its hull. From the\nyacht's ports the fighting ants looked like infuriated machines, engaged\nin each other's destruction. One might see a warrior of unidentified\nallegiance with its own abdomen ripped open, furiously rending an enemy\nwithout regard to its own mortal wound. There were those who had\nliterally been torn in half, so that only head and thorax remained, but\nthey fought on no less valiantly than the rest.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt the edges of the fighting such cripples were more numerous. Ants with\nantenna shorn off or broken, with legs missing, utterly doomed,--they\nsometimes wandered forlornly beyond the fighting, the battle seemingly\nforgotten. But even such dazed and incapacitated casualties came upon\neach other. If they smelled alike, they ignored each other. Every\nant-city has its particular smell which its inhabitants share.\nPossession of the national odor is at once a certificate of citizenship\nin peacetime and a uniform in war. When such victims of the battle came\nupon enemy walking wounded, they fought.\n\nAnd the giant praying mantis remained placidly and invulnerably still.\nIt plucked single fighters from the battle and dined upon them while\nthey struggled, and plucked other fighters, and consumed them. It\nignored the battle and the high purpose and self-sacrificing patriotism\nof the ants. Immune to them and disregarded by them, it fed on them\nwhile the battle raged.\n\nPresently the gray light overhead turned faintly pink, and became a\ndeeper tint and then crimson. In time there was darkness. The noise of\nbattle ended. The sounds of the day diminished and ceased, and other\nmonstrous outcries took their place.\n\nThere were bellowings in the blackness without the _Nadine_. There were\nchirpings become baritone, and senseless uproars which might be\nunbelievable modifications of once-shrill and once-tranquil night-sounds\nof other worlds. And there came a peculiar, steady, unrhythmic pattering\nsound. It seemed like something falling upon the blanket-like upper\nsurface of the soil.\n\nMoran opened the airlock door and thrust out a torch to see. Its\nintolerably bright glare showed the battlefield abandoned. Most of the\ndead and wounded had been carried away. Which, of course, was not\nsolicitude for the wounded or reverence for the dead heroes. Dead ants,\nlike dead centipedes, were booty of the only kind the creatures of this\nworld could know. The dead were meat. The wounded were dead before they\nwere carried away.\n\nMoran peered out, with Carol looking affrightedly over his shoulder. The\nair seemed to shine slightly in the glare of the torch. The pattering\nsound was abruptly explained. Large, slow, widely-separated raindrops\nfell heavily and steadily from the cloud-banks overhead. Moran could see\nthem strike. Each spot of wetness glistened briefly. Then the rain-drop\nwas absorbed by the ground.\n\nBut there were other noises than the ceaseless tumult on the ground.\nThere were sounds in the air; the beating of enormous wings. Moran\nlooked up, squinting against the light. There were things moving about\nthe black sky. Gigantic things.\n\nSomething moved, too, across the diminishingly lighted surface about the\nyacht. There were glitterings. Shining armor. Multi-faceted eyes. A\ngigantic, horny, spiked object crawled toward the torch-glare,\nfascinated by it. Something else dived insanely. It splashed upon the\nflexible white surface twenty yards away, and struggled upward and took\ncrazily off again. It careened blindly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt hit the yacht, a quarter-ton of night-flying beetle. The air seemed\nfilled with flying things. There were moths with twenty-foot wings and\neyes which glowed like rubies in the torch's light. There were beetles\nof all sizes from tiny six-inch things to monsters in whom Moran did not\nbelieve even when he saw them. All were drawn by the light which should\nnot exist under the cloud-bank. They droned and fluttered and performed\nlunatic evolutions, coming always closer to the flame.\n\nMoran cut off the torch and closed the lock-door from the inside.\n\n\"We don't load bessendium tonight,\" he said with some grimness. \"To have\nno light, with what crawls about in the darkness, would be suicide. But\nto use lights would be worse. If you people are going to salvage the\nstuff in that wreck, you'll have to wait for daylight. At least then you\ncan see what's coming after you.\"\n\nThey went into the yacht proper. There was no longer any question about\nthe planet's air. If insects which were descendents of terrestrial forms\ncould breathe it, so could men. When the first insect-eggs were brought\nhere, the air had to be fit for them if they were to survive. It would\nnot have changed.\n\nBurleigh sat in the control-room with a double handful of purple\ncrystals before him.\n\n\"This,\" he said when Moran and Carol re\u00ebntered, \"this is bessendium past\nquestion. I've been thinking what it means.\"\n\n\"Money,\" said Moran drily. \"You'll all be rich. You'll probably retire\nfrom politics.\"\n\n\"That wasn't exactly what I had in mind,\" said Burleigh distastefully.\n\"You've gotten us into the devil of a mess, Moran!\"\n\n\"For which,\" said Moran with ironic politeness, \"there is a perfect\nsolution. You kill me, either directly or by leaving me marooned here.\"\n\nBurleigh scowled.\n\n\"We have to land at space-ports for supplies. We can't hope to hide you,\nit's required that landed ships be sterilized against infections from\noff-planet. We can't pass you as a normal passenger. You're not on the\nship's papers and they're alteration-proof. Nobody's ever been able to\nchange a ship's papers and not be caught! We could land and tell the\ntruth, that you hijacked the ship and we finally overpowered you. But\nthere are reasons against that.\"\n\n\"Naturally!\" agreed Moran. \"I'd be killed anyhow and you'd be subject to\nintensive investigation. And you're fugitives as much as I am.\"\n\n\"Just so,\" admitted Burleigh.\n\nMoran shrugged.\n\n\"Which leaves just one answer. You maroon me and go on your way.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBurleigh said painfully;\n\n\"There's this bessendium. If there's more--especially if there's\nmore--we can leave you here with part of it. When we get far enough\naway, we charter a ship to come and get you. It'll be arranged.\nSomebody will be listed as of that ship's company, but he'll slip away\nfrom the space-port and not be on board at all. Then you're picked up\nand landed using his name.\"\n\n\"If,\" said Moran ironically, \"I am alive when the ship gets here. If I'm\nnot, the crew of the chartered ship will be in trouble, short one man on\nreturn to port. You'll have trouble getting anybody to run that risk!\"\n\n\"We're trying to work out a way to save you!\" insisted Burleigh angrily.\n\"Harper would have been killed but for you. And--this bessendium will\nfinance the underground work that will presently make a success of our\nrevolution. We're grateful! We're trying to help you!\"\n\n\"So you maroon me,\" said Moran. Then he said; \"But you've skipped the\nreal problem! If anything goes wrong, Carol's in it! There's no way to\ndo anything without risk for her! That's the problem! I could kill all\nyou characters, land somewhere on a colonized planet exactly as you\nlanded here, and be gone from the yacht on foot before anybody could\nfind me! But I have a slight aversion to getting a girl killed or\nkilling her just for my own convenience. It's settled. I stay here. You\ncan try to arrange the other business if you like. But it's a bad\ngamble.\"\n\nCarol was very pale. Burleigh stood up.\n\n\"You said that, I didn't. But I don't think we should leave you here. Up\nnear the ice-cap should be infinitely better for you. We'll load the\nrest of the bessendium tomorrow, find you a place, leave you a beacon,\nand go.\"\n\nHe went out. Carol turned a white face to Moran.\n\n\"Is that--is that the real trouble? Do you really--\"\n\nMoran looked at her stonily.\n\n\"I like to make heroic gestures,\" he told her. \"Actually, Burleigh's a\nvery noble sort of character himself. He proposes to leave me with\ntreasure that he could take. Even more remarkably, he proposes to divide\nup what you take, instead of applying it all to further his political\nideals. Most men like him would take it all for the revolution!\"\n\n\"But--but--.\"\n\nCarol's expression was pure misery. Moran walked deliberately across the\ncontrol-room. He glanced out of a port. A face looked in. It filled the\ntransparent opening. It was unthinkable. It was furry. There were\nglistening chitinous areas. There was a proboscis like an elephant's\ntrunk, curled horribly. The eyes were multiple and mad.\n\nIt looked in, drawn and hypnotized by the light shining out on this\nnightmare world from the control-room ports.\n\nMoran touched the button that closed the shutters.\n\n\nIII.\n\nWhen morning came, its arrival was the exact reversal of the coming of\nnight. In the beginning there was darkness, and in the darkness there\nwas horror.\n\nThe creatures of the night untiringly filled the air with sound, and the\nsounds were discordant and gruesome and revolting. The creatures of this\nplanet were gigantic. They should have adopted new customs appropriate\nto the dignity of their increased size. But they hadn't. The manners and\ncustoms of insects are immutable. They feed upon specific prey--spiders\nare an exception, but they are not insects at all--and they lay their\neggs in specific fashion in specific places, and they behave according\nto instincts which are so detailed as to leave them no choice at all in\ntheir actions. They move blindly about, reacting like automata of\ninfinite complexity which are capable of nothing not built into them\nfrom the beginning. Centuries and millenia do not change them. Travel\nacross star-clusters leaves them with exactly the capacities for\nreaction that their remotest ancestors had, before men lifted off\nancient Earth's green surface.\n\nThe first sign of dawn was deep, deep, deepest red in the cloud-bank no\nmore than fifteen hundred feet overhead. The red became brighter, and\npresently was as brilliant as dried blood. Again presently it was\ncrimson over all the half-mile circle that human eyes could penetrate.\nLater still--but briefly--it was pink. Then the sky became gray. From\nthat color it did not change again.\n\nMoran joined Burleigh in a survey of the landscape from the\ncontrol-room. The battlefield was empty now. Of the thousands upon\nthousands of stinking combatants who'd rent and torn each other the\nevening before, there remained hardly a trace. Here and there, to be\nsure, a severed saw-toothed leg remained. There were perhaps as many as\nfour relatively intact corpses not yet salvaged. But something was being\ndone about them.\n\nThere were tiny, brightly-banded beetles hardly a foot long which\nlabored industriously over such frayed objects. They worked agitatedly\nin the yeasty stuff which on this world took the place of soil. They\nexcavated, beneath the bodies of the dead ants, hollows into which those\ncarcasses could descend. They pushed the yeasty, curdy stuff up and\naround the sides of those to-be-desired objects. The dead warriors sank\nlittle by little toward oblivion as the process went on. The up-thrust,\ndug-out material collapsed upon them as they descended. In a very\nlittle while they would be buried where no larger carrion-eater would\ndiscover them, and then the brightly-colored sexton beetles would begin\na banquet to last until only fragments of chitinous armor remained.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut Moran and Burleigh, in the _Nadine's_ control-room, could hardly\nnote such details.\n\n\"You saw the cargo,\" said Burleigh, frowning. \"How's it packed? The\nbessendium, I mean.\"\n\n\"It's in small boxes too heavy to be handled easily,\" said Moran.\n\"Anyhow the _Malabar's_ crew broke some of them open to load the stuff\non their lifeboats.\"\n\n\"The lifeboats are all gone?\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" said Moran. \"At a guess they'd have used all of them even\nif they didn't need them for the crew. They could carry extra food and\nweapons and such.\"\n\n\"How much bessendium is left?\"\n\n\"Probably twenty boxes unopened,\" said Moran. \"I can't guess at the\nweight, but it's a lot. They opened six boxes.\" He paused. \"I have a\nsuggestion.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"When you've supplied yourselves,\" said Moran, \"leave some space-port\nsomewhere with papers saying you're going to hunt for minerals on some\nplausible planet. You can get such a clearance. Then you can return with\nbessendium coming out of the _Nadine's_ waste-pipes and people will be\nsurprised but not suspicious. You'll file for mineral rights, and cash\nyour cargo. Everybody will get busy trying to grab off the mineral\nrights for themselves. You can clear out and let them try to find the\nbessendium lode. You'll be allowed to go, all right, and you can settle\ndown somewhere rich and highly respected.\"\n\n\"Hmmm,\" said Burleigh. Then he said uncomfortably; \"One wonders about\nthe original owners of the stuff.\"\n\n\"After a hundred and fifty years,\" said Moran, \"who'd you divide with?\nThe insurance company that paid for the lost ship? The heirs of the\ncrew? How'd you find them?\" Then he added amusedly, \"Only revolutionists\nand enemies of governments would be honest enough to worry about that!\"\n\nBrawn came into the control-room. He said broodingly that breakfast was\nready. Moran had never heard him speak in a normally cheerful voice.\nWhen he went out, Moran said;\n\n\"I don't suppose he'll be so gloomy when he's rich!\"\n\n\"His family was wiped out,\" said Burleigh curtly, \"by the government we\nwere fighting. The girl he was going to marry, too.\"\n\n\"Then I take back what I said,\" said Moran ruefully.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey went down to breakfast. Carol served it. She did not look well. Her\neyes seemed to show that she'd been crying. But she treated Moran\nexactly like anyone else. Harper was very quiet, too. He took very\nseriously the fact that Moran had saved his life at the risk of his on\nthe day before. Brawn breakfasted in a subdued, moody fashion. Only\nHallet seemed to have reacted to the discovery of a salvageable shipment\nof bessendium that should make everybody rich,--everybody but Moran, who\nwas ultimately responsible for the find.\n\n\"Burleigh,\" said Hallet expansively, \"says the stuff you brought back\nfrom the wreck is worth fifty thousand credits, at least. What's the\nwhole shipment worth?\"\n\n\"I've no idea,\" said Moran. \"It would certainly pay for a fleet of\nspace-liners, and I'd give all of it for a ticket on one of them.\"\n\n\"But how much is there in bulk?\" insisted Hallet.\n\n\"I saw that half a dozen boxes had been broken open and emptied for the\nlifeboat voyagers,\" Moran told him. \"I didn't count the balance, but\nthere were several times as many untouched. If they're all full of the\nsame stuff, you can guess almost any sum you please.\"\n\n\"Millions, eh?\" said Hallet. His eyes glistened. \"Billions? Plenty for\neverybody?\"\n\n\"There's never plenty for more than one,\" said Moran mildly. \"That's the\nway we seem to be made.\"\n\nBurleigh said suddenly;\n\n\"I'm worried about getting the stuff aboard. We can't afford to lose\nanybody, and if we have to fight the creatures here and every time we\nkill one its carcass draws others.\"\n\nMoran took a piece of bread. He said;\n\n\"I've been thinking about survival-tactics for myself as a castaway. I\nthink a torch is the answer. In any emergency on the yeast surface, I\ncan burn a hole and drop down in it. The monsters are stupid. In most\ncases they'll go away because they stop seeing me. In the others,\nthey'll come to the hole and I'll burn them. It won't be pleasant, but\nit may be practical.\"\n\nBurleigh considered it.\n\n\"It may be,\" he admitted. \"It may be.\"\n\nHallet said;\n\n\"I want to see that work before I trust the idea.\"\n\n\"Somebody has to try it,\" agreed Moran. \"Anyhow my life's going to\ndepend on it.\"\n\nCarol left the room. Moran looked after her as the door closed.\n\n\"She doesn't like the idea of our leaving you behind,\" said Burleigh.\n\"None of us do.\"\n\n\"I'm touched.\"\n\n\"We'll try to get a ship to come for you, quickly,\" said Burleigh.\n\n\"I'm sure you will,\" said Moran politely.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut he was not confident. The laws governing space-travel were very\nstrict indeed, and enforced with all the rigor possible. On their\nenforcement, indeed, depended the law and order of the planets.\nCriminals had to know that they could not escape to space whenever\nmatters got too hot for them aground. For a spaceman to trifle with\ninterstellar-traffic laws meant at the least that they were grounded for\nlife. But the probabilities were much worse than that. It was most\nlikely that Burleigh or any of the others would be reported to\nspace-port police instantly they attempted to charter a ship for any\nkind of illegal activity. Moran made a mental note to warn Burleigh\nabout it.\n\nBy now, though, he was aware of a very deep irritation at the idea of\nbeing killed, whether by monsters on this planet or men sent to pick him\nup for due process of law. When he made the grand gesture of seizing the\n_Nadine_, he'd known nothing about the people on board, and he hadn't\nreally expected to succeed. His real hope was to be killed without\npreliminary scientific questioning. Modern techniques of interrogation\nwere not torture, but they stripped away all concealments of motive and\nto a great degree revealed anybody who'd helped one. Moran had killed a\nman in a fair fight the other man did not want to engage in. If he were\ncaught on Coryus or returned to it, his motivation could be read from\nhis mind. And if that was done the killing--and the sacrifice of his own\nfuture and life--would have been useless. But he'd been prepared to be\nkilled. Even now he'd prefer to die here on Tethys than in the strictly\npainless manner of executions on Coryus. But he was now deeply resistant\nto the idea of dying at all. There was Carol....\n\nHe thrust such thoughts aside.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMorning was well begun when they prepared to transfer the wreck's\ntreasure to the _Nadine_. Moran went first. At fifteen-foot intervals he\nburned holes in the curd-like, elastic ground-cover. Some of the holes\nwent down only four feet to the stone beneath it. Some went down six.\nBut a man who jumped down one of them would be safe against attack\nexcept from directly overhead, which was an unlikely direction for\nattack by an insect. Carol had seen a wasp fly past the day before. She\nsaid it was as big as a cow. A sting from such a monster would instantly\nbe fatal. But no wasp would have the intelligence to use its sting on\nsomething it had not seized. A man should be safe in such a fox-hole. If\na creature did try to investigate the opening, a torch could come into\nplay. It was the most practical possible way for a man to defend himself\non this world.\n\nMoran made more than a dozen such holes of refuge in the line between\nthe _Nadine_ and the wreck. Carol watched with passionate solicitude\nfrom a control-room port as he progressed. He entered the wreck through\nthe lock-doors he'd uncovered. Harper followed doggedly, not less than\ntwo fox-holes behind. Carol's voice reassured them, the while, that\nwithin the half-mile circle of visibility no monster walked or flew.\n\nInside the wreck, Moran placed emergency-lanterns to light the dark\ninterior. He placed them along the particularly inconvenient passageways\nof a ship lying on its side instead of standing upright. He was at work\nbreaking open a box of bessendium when Harper joined him. Harper said\nheavily;\n\n\"I've brought a bag. It was a pillow. Carol took the foam out.\"\n\n\"We'll fill it,\" said Moran. \"Not too full. The stuff's heavy.\"\n\nHarper watched while Moran poured purple crystals into it from his\ncupped hands.\n\n\"There you are,\" said Moran. \"Take it away.\"\n\n\"Look!\" said Harper. \"I owe you plenty--.\"\n\n\"Then pay me,\" said Moran, exasperatedly, \"by shutting up! By making\nBurleigh damned careful about who he tries to hire to come after me! And\nby getting this cargo-shifting business in operation! The _Nadine's_\nalmost due on Loris. You don't want to have the space-port police get\nsuspicions. Get moving!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHarper clambered over the side of doorways. He disappeared. Moran was\nalone in the ship. He explored. He found that the crew that had\nabandoned the _Malabar_ had been guilty of a singular oversight for a\ncrew abandoning ship. But, of course, they'd been distracted not only by\ntheir predicament but by the decision to carry part of the ship's\nprecious cargo with them, so they could make it a profitable enterprise\nto rescue them. They hadn't taken the trouble to follow all the rules\nlaid down for a crew taking to the boats.\n\nMoran made good their omission. He was back in the cargo-hold when Brawn\narrived. Burleigh came next. Then Harper again. Hallet came last of the\nfour men of the yacht. They did not make a continuous chain of men\nmoving back and forth between the two ships. Three men came, and loaded\nup, and went back. Then three men came again, one by one. There could\nnever be a moment when a single refuge-hole in the soil could be needed\nby two men at the same time.\n\nWithin the first hour of work at transferring treasure, the bolt-holes\ncame into use. Carol called anxiously that a gigantic beetle neared the\nship and would apparently pass between it and the yacht. At the time,\nBrawn and Harper were moving from the _Malabar_ toward the _Nadine_, and\nHallet was about to leave the wreck's lock.\n\nHe watched with wide eyes. The beetle was truly a monster, the size of a\nhippopotamus as pictured in the culture-books about early human history.\nIts jaws, pronged like antlers, projected two yards before its huge,\nfaceted eyes. It seemed to drag itself effortfully over the elastic\nsurface of the ground. It passed a place where red, foleated fungus grew\nin a fantastic absence of pattern on the surface of the ground. It went\nthrough a streak of dusty-blue mould, which it stirred into a cloud of\nspores as it passed. It crawled on and on. Harper popped down into the\nnearest bolt-hole, his torch held ready. Brawn stood beside another\nrefuge, sixty feet away.\n\nCarol's voice came to their helmet-phones, anxious and exact. Hallet, in\nthe lock-door, heard her tell Harper that the beetle would pass very\nclose to him and to stay still. It moved on and on. It would be very\nclose indeed. Carol gasped in horror.\n\nThe monster passed partly over the hole in which Harper crouched. One of\nits clawed feet slipped down into the opening. But the beetle went on,\nunaware of Harper. It crawled toward the encircling mist upon some\nerrand of its own. It was mindless. It was like a complex and highly\ndecorated piece of machinery which did what it was wound up to do, and\nnothing else.\n\nHarper came out of the bolt-hole when Carol, her voice shaky with\nrelief, told him it was safe. He went doggedly on to the _Nadine_,\ncarrying his bag of purple crystals. Brawn followed, moodily.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHallet, with a singularly exultant look upon his face, ventured out of\nthe airlock and moved across the fungoid world. He carried a king's\nransom to be added to the riches already transferred to the yacht.\n\nMoving the bessendium was a tedious task. One plastic box in the\ncargo-hold held a quantity of crystals that three men took two trips\neach to carry. In mid-morning the bag in Hallet's hand seemed to slip\njust when Moran completed filling it. It toppled and spilled half its\ncontents on the cargo-hold floor, which had been a sidewall. He began\npainstakingly to gather up the precious stuff and get it back in the\nbag. The others went on to the _Nadine_. Hallet turned off his\nhelmet-phone and gestured to Moran to remove his helmet. Moran, his\neyebrows raised, obeyed the suggestion.\n\n\"How anxious,\" asked Hallet abruptly, gathering up the dropped crystals,\n\"how anxious are you to be left behind here?\"\n\n\"I'm not anxious at all,\" said Moran.\n\n\"Would you like to make a deal to go along when the _Nadine_\nlifts?--_If_ there's a way to get past the space-port police?\"\n\n\"Probably,\" said Moran. \"Certainly! But there's no way to do it.\"\n\n\"There is,\" said Hallet. \"I know it. Is it a deal?\"\n\n\"What is the deal?\"\n\n\"You do as I say,\" said Hallet significantly. \"Just as I say! Then ...\"\n\nThe lock-door opened, some distance away. Hallet stood up and said in a\ncommanding tone;\n\n\"Keep your mouth shut. I'll tell you what to do and when.\"\n\nHe put on his helmet and turned on the phone once more. He went toward\nthe lock-door. Moran heard him exchange words with Harper and Brawn,\nback with empty bags to fill with crystals worth many times the price of\ndiamonds. But diamonds were made in half-ton lots, nowadays.\n\nMoran followed their bags. He was frowning. As Harper was about to\nfollow Brawn, Moran almost duplicated Hallet's gestures to have him\nremove his helmet.\n\n\"I want Burleigh to come next trip,\" he told Harper, \"and make some\nexcuse to stay behind a moment and talk to me without the helmet-phones\npicking up everything I say to him. Understand?\"\n\nHarper nodded. But Burleigh did not come on the next trip. It was not\nuntil near midday that he came to carry a load of treasure to the yacht.\n\nWhen he did come, though, he took off his helmet and turned off the\nphone without the need of a suggestion.\n\n\"I've been arranging storage for this stuff,\" he said. \"I've opened\nplates between the hulls to dump it in. I've told Carol, too, that we've\ngot to do a perfect job of cleaning up. There must be no stray crystals\non the floor.\"\n\n\"Better search the bunks, too,\" said Moran drily, \"so nobody will put\naside a particularly pretty crystal to gloat over. Listen!\"\n\nHe told Burleigh exactly what Hallet had said and what he'd answered.\nBurleigh looked acutely unhappy.\n\n\"Hallet isn't dedicated like the rest of us were,\" he said distressedly.\n\"We brought him along partly out of fear that if he were captured he'd\nbreak down and reveal what he knows of the Underground we led, and much\nof which we had to leave behind. But I'll be able to finance a real\nrevolt, now!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMoran regarded him with irony. Burleigh was a capable man and a\nconscientious one. It would be very easy to trust him, and it is\nall-important to an Underground that its leaders be trusted. But it is\nalso important that they be capable of flint-like hardness on occasion.\nTo Moran, it seemed that Burleigh had not quite the adamantine\nresolution required for leadership in a conspiracy which was to become a\nsuccessful revolt. He was--and to Moran it seemed regrettable--capable\nof the virtue of charity.\n\n\"I've told you,\" he said evenly. \"Maybe you'll think it's a scheme on my\npart to get Hallet dumped and myself elected to take his identity. But\nwhat happens from now on is your business. Beginning this moment, I'm\ntaking care of my own skin. I've gotten reconciled to the idea of dying,\nbut I'd hate for it not to do anybody any good.\"\n\n\"Carol,\" said Burleigh unhappily, \"is much distressed.\"\n\n\"That's very kind,\" said Moran sarcastically. \"Now take your bag of\nstuff and get going.\"\n\nBurleigh obeyed. Moran went back to the business of breaking open the\nstrong plastic boxes of bessendium so their contents could be carried in\nforty-pound lots to the _Nadine_.\n\nThinking of Carol, he did not like the way things seemed to be going.\nSince the discovery of the bessendium, Hallet had been developing ideas.\nThey did not look as if they meant good fortune for Moran without\ncorresponding bad fortune for the others. Obviously, Moran couldn't be\nhidden on the _Nadine_ during the space-port sterilization of the ship\nwhich prevented plagues from being carried from world to world. Hallet\ncould have no reason to promise such a thing. Before landing here, he'd\nurged that Moran simply be dumped out the airlock. This proposal to save\nhis life....\n\nMoran considered the situation grimly while the business of ferrying\ntreasure to the yacht went on almost monotonously. It had stopped once\nduring the forenoon while a giant beetle went by. Later, it stopped\nagain because a gigantic flying thing hovered overhead. Carol did not\nknow what it was, but its bulging abdomen ended in an organ which\nappeared to be a sting. It was plainly hunting. There was no point in\nfighting it. Presently it went away, and just before it disappeared in\nthe circular wall of mist it dived headlong to the ground. A little\nlater it rose slowly into the air, carrying something almost as large as\nitself. It went away into the mist.\n\nAgain, once a green-and-yellow caterpillar marched past upon some\nmysterious enterprise. It was covered with incredibly long fur, and it\nmoved with an undulating motion of all its segments, one after another.\nIt seemed well over ten yards in length, and its body appeared\nimpossibly massive. But a large part of the bulk would be the\ntwo-foot-long or longer hairs which stuck out stiffly in all directions.\nIt, too, went away.\n\nBut continually and constantly there was a bedlam of noises. From\nunderneath the yielding skin of the yeast-ground, there came clickings.\nSometimes there were quiverings of the surface as if it were alive, but\nthey would be the activities of ten and twelve-inch beetles who lived in\nsubterranean tunnels in it. There were those preposterous noises like\nsomeone rattling a stick along a picket fence--only deafening--and there\nwere baritone chirpings and deep bass boomings from somewhere far away.\nMoran guessed that the last might be frogs, but if so they were vastly\nlarger than men.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShortly after what was probably midday, Moran brushed off his hands. The\nbessendium part of the cargo of the wrecked _Malabar_ had been salvaged.\nIt was hidden between the twin hulls of the yacht. Moran had, quite\nprivately, attended to a matter the wreck's long-dead crew should have\ndone when they left it. Now, in theory, the _Nadine_ should lift off and\ntake Moran to some hastily scouted spot not too far from the ice-cap. It\nshould leave him there with what food could be spared, and the kit of\nseeds that might feed him after it was gone, and weapons that might but\nprobably wouldn't enable him to defend himself, and with a radio-beacon\nto try to have hope in. Then,--that would be that.\n\n\"Calling,\" said Moran sardonically into his helmet-phone. \"Everything's\ncleaned up here. What next?\"\n\n\"_You can come along_,\" said Hallet's voice from the ship. It was\nshivery. It was gleeful. \"_Just in time for lunch!_\"\n\nMoran went along the disoriented passages of the _Malabar_ to the lock.\nHe turned off the beacon that had tried uselessly during six human\ngenerations to call for help for men now long dead. He went out the\nlock and closed it behind him. It was not likely that this planet would\never become a home for men. If there were some strangeness in its\nconstitution that made the descendents of insects placed upon it grow to\nbe giants, humans would not want to settle on it. And there were plenty\nof much more suitable worlds. So the wrecked space-ship would lie here,\nunder deeper and ever deeper accumulations of the noisesome stuff that\npassed for soil. Perhaps millenia from now, the sturdy, resistant metal\nof the hull would finally rust through, and then--nothing. No man in all\ntime to come would ever see the _Malabar_ again.\n\nShrugging, he went toward the _Nadine_. He walked through bedlam. He\ncould see a quarter-mile in one direction, and a quarter-mile in\nanother. He could not see more than a little distance upward. The\n_Nadine_ had landed upon a world with tens of millions of square miles\nof surface, and nobody had moved more than a hundred yards from its\nlanding-place, and now it would leave and all wonders and all horrors\noutside this one quarter of a square mile would remain unknown....\n\nHe went to the airlock and shed his suit. He opened the inner door.\nHallet waited for him.\n\n\"Everybody's at lunch,\" he said. \"We'll join them.\"\n\nMoran eyed him sharply. Hallet grinned widely.\n\n\"We're going to take off to find a place for you as soon as we've\neaten,\" he said.\n\nThere was mockery in the tone. It occurred abruptly to Moran that Hallet\nwas the kind of person who might, to be sure, plan complete disloyalty\nto his companions for his own benefit. But he might also enjoy betrayal\nfor its own sake. He might, for example, find it amusing to make a man\nunder sentence of death or marooning believe that he would escape, so\nHallet could have the purely malicious pleasure of disappointing him. He\nmight look for Moran to break when he learned that he was to die here\nafter all.\n\nMoran clamped his lips tightly. Carol would be better off if that was\nthe answer. He went toward the yacht's mess-room. Hallet followed close\nbehind. Moran pushed the door aside and entered. Burleigh and Harper and\nBrawn looked at him, Carol raised her eyes. They glistened with tears.\n\nHallet said gleefully;\n\n\"Here goes!\"\n\nStanding behind Moran, he thrust a hand-blaster past Moran's body and\npulled the trigger. He held the trigger down for continuous fire as he\ntraversed the weapon to wipe out everybody but Moran and himself.\n\n\nIV.\n\nMoran responded instantly. His hands flew to Hallet's throat, blind fury\nmaking him unaware of any thought but a frantic lust to kill. It was\nvery strange that Moran somehow noticed Hallet's hand insanely pulling\nthe trigger of the blast-pistol over and over and over without result.\nHe remembered it later. Perhaps he shared Hallet's blank disbelief that\none could pull the trigger of a blaster and have nothing at all happen\nin consequence. But nothing did happen, and suddenly he dropped the\nweapon and clawed desperately at Moran's fingers about his throat. But\nthat was too late.\n\nThere was singularly little disturbance at the luncheon-table. The whole\nevent was climax and anticlimax together. Hallet's intention was so\nappallingly murderous and his action so shockingly futile that the four\nwho were to have been his victims tended to stare blankly while Moran\nthrottled him.\n\nBurleigh seemed to recover first. He tried to pull Moran's hands loose\nfrom Hallet's throat. Lacking success he called to the others. \"Harper!\nBrawn! Help me!\"\n\nIt took all three of them to release Hallet. Then Moran stood panting,\nshaking, his eyes like flames.\n\n\"He--he--\" panted Moran. \"He was going to kill Carol!\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Burleigh, distressedly. \"He was going to kill all of us.\nYou gave me an inkling, so while he was packing bessendium between the\nhulls, and had his space-suit hanging in the airlock, I doctored the\nblaster in the space-suit pocket.\" He looked down at Hallet. \"Is he\nstill alive?\"\n\nBrawn bent over Hallet. He nodded.\n\n\"Put him in the airlock for the time being,\" said Burleigh. \"And lock\nit. When he comes to, we'll decide what to do.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHarper and Brawn took Hallet by the arms and hauled him along the\npassageway. The inner door of the lock clanged shut on him.\n\n\"We'll give him a hearing, of course,\" said Burleigh conscientiously.\n\"But we should survey the situation first.\"\n\nTo Moran the situation required no survey, but he viewed it from a\nviolently personal viewpoint which would neither require or allow\ndiscussion. He knew what he meant to do about Hallet. He said harshly;\n\n\"Go ahead. When you're through I'll tell you what will be done.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe went away. To the control-room. There he paced up and down, trying to\nbeat back the fury which rose afresh at intervals of less than minutes.\nHe did not think of his own situation, just then. There are more\nimportant things than survival.\n\nHe struggled for coolness, with the action before him known. He didn't\nglance out the ports at the half-mile circle in which vision was\npossible. Beyond the mist there might be anything; an ocean, swarming\nmetropoli of giant insects, a mountain-range. Nobody on the _Nadine_ had\nexplored. But Moran did not think of such matters now. Hallet had tried\nto murder Carol, and Moran meant to take action, and there were matters\nwhich might result from it. The matter the crew of the _Malabar_ had\nforgotten to attend to--.\n\nHe searched for paper and a pen. He found both in a drawer for the\nyacht's hand-written log. He wrote. He placed a small object in the\ndrawer. He had barely closed it when Carol was at the control-room door.\nShe said in a small voice;\n\n\"They want to talk to you.\"\n\nHe held up the paper.\n\n\"Read this later. Not now,\" he said curtly. He opened and closed the\ndrawer again, this time putting the paper in it. \"I want you to read\nthis after the Hallet business is settled. I'm afraid that I'm not going\nto look well in your eyes.\"\n\nShe swallowed and did not speak. He went to where the others sat in\nofficial council. Burleigh said heavily;\n\n\"We've come to a decision. We shall call Hallet and hear what he has to\nsay, but we had to consider various courses of action and decide which\nwere possible and which were not.\"\n\nMoran nodded grimly. He had made his own decision. It was not too much\nunlike the one that, carried out, had made him seize the _Nadine_ for\nescape from Coryus. But he'd listen. Harper looked doggedly resolved.\nBrawn seemed moody as usual.\n\n\"I'm listening,\" said Moran.\n\n\"Hallet,\" said Burleigh regretfully, \"intended to murder all of us and\nwith your help take the _Nadine_ to some place where he could hope to\nland without space-port inspection.\"\n\nMoran observed;\n\n\"He didn't discuss that part of his plans. He only asked if I'd make a\ndeal to escape being marooned.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Burleigh, nodding. \"I'm sure--\"\n\n\"My own idea,\" said Moran, \"when I tried to seize the _Nadine_, was to\ntry to reach one of several newly-settled planets where things aren't\ntoo well organized. I'd memos of some such planets. I hoped to get to\nground somewhere in a wilderness on one of them and work my way on foot\nto a new settlement. There I'd explain that I'd been hunting or\nprospecting or something of the sort. On a settled planet that would be\nimpossible. On a brand-new one people are less fussy and I might have\nbeen accepted quite casually.\"\n\n\"Hallet may have had some such idea in his mind,\" agreed Burleigh. \"With\na few bessendium crystals to show, he would seem a successful\nprospector. He'd be envied but not suspected. To be sure!\"\n\n\"But,\" said Moran drily, \"he'd be best off alone. So if he had that sort\nof idea, he intended to murder me too.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBurleigh nodded. \"Undoubtedly. But to come to our decision. We can keep\nhim on board under watch--as we did you--and leave you here. This has\ndisadvantages. We owe you much. There would be risk of his taking\nsomeone unawares and fighting for his life. Even if all went as we\nwished, and we landed and dispersed, he could inform the space-port\nofficials anonymously of what had happened, leading to investigation and\nthe ruin of any plans for the future revival of our underground. Also,\nit would destroy any hope for your rescue.\"\n\nMoran smiled wryly. He hadn't much hope of that, if he were marooned.\n\n\"We could leave him here,\" said Burleigh unhappily, \"with you taking his\nidentity for purposes of landing. But I do not think it would be wise to\nsend a ship after him. He would be resentful. If rescued, he would do\neverything possible to spoil all our future lives, and we are\nfugitives.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes!\" said Moran, still more wryly amused.\n\n\"I am afraid,\" said Burleigh reluctantly, \"that we can only offer him\nhis choice of being marooned or going out the airlock. I cannot think of\nany other alternative.\"\n\n\"I can,\" said Moran. \"I'm going to kill him.\"\n\nBurleigh blinked. Harper looked up sharply.\n\n\"We fight,\" said Moran grimly. \"Armed exactly alike. He can try to kill\nme. I'll give him the same chance I have. But I'll kill him. They used\nto call it a duel, and they came to consider it a very immoral business.\nBut that's beside the point. I won't agree to marooning him here. That's\nmurder. I won't agree to throwing him out the airlock. That's murder,\ntoo. But I have the right to kill him if it's in fair fight. That's\njustice! You can bring him in and let him decide if he wants to be\nmarooned or fight me. I think he's just raging enough to want to do all\nthe damage he can, now that his plans have gone sour.\"\n\nBurleigh fidgeted. He looked at Harper. Harper nodded grudgingly. He\nlooked at Brawn. Brawn nodded moodily.\n\nBurleigh said fretfully. \"Very well ... Harper, you and Brawn bring him\nhere. We'll see what he says. Be careful!\"\n\nHarper and Brawn went down the passageway. Moran saw them take out the\nblasters they'd worn since he took over the ship. They were ready. They\nunlocked and opened the inner airlock door.\n\nThere was silence. Harper looked shocked. He went in the airlock while\nBrawn stared, for once startled out of moodiness.\n\nHarper came out.\n\n\"He's gone,\" he said in a flat voice. \"Out the airlock.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll the rest went instantly to look. The airlock was empty. By the most\nnatural and inevitable of oversights, when Hallet was put in it for a\ntemporary cell, no one had thought of locking the outer door. There was\nno point in it. It only led out to the nightmare world. And out there\nHallet would be in monstrous danger; he'd have no food. At most his only\nweapon would be the torch Moran had carried to the _Malabar_ and brought\nback again. He could have no hope of any kind. He could feel only\ndespair unthinkable and horror undiluted.\n\nThere was a buzzing sound in the airlock. A space-suit hung there. The\nhelmet-phone was turned on. Hallet's voice came out, flat and metallic\nand desperate and filled with hate:\n\n\"_What're you going to do now? You'd better think of a bargain to offer\nme! You can't lift off! I took the fuel-block so Moran couldn't afford\nto kill me after the rest of you were dead. You can't lift off the\nground! Now give me a guarantee I can believe in or you stay here with\nme!_\"\n\nHarper bolted for the engine-room. He came back, his face ashen. \"He's\nright. It's gone. He took it.\"\n\nMoran stirred. Burleigh wrung his hands. Moran reached down the\nspace-suit from whose helmet the voice came tinnily. He began to put it\non. Carol opened her lips to speak, and he covered the microphone with\nhis palm.\n\n\"I'm going to go out and kill him,\" said Moran very quietly. \"Somebody\nelse had better come along just in case. But you can't make a bargain\nwith him. He can't believe in any promise, because he wouldn't keep\nany.\"\n\nHarper went away again. He came back, struggling into a space-suit.\nBrawn moved quickly. Burleigh suddenly stirred and went for a suit.\n\n\"We want torches,\" said Moran evenly, \"for our own safety, and blasters\nbecause they'll drop Hallet. Carol, you monitor what goes on. When we\nneed to come back, you can use the direction-finder and talk us back to\nthe yacht.\"\n\n\"But--but--\"\n\n\"_What are you going to do?_\" rasped the voice shrilly. \"_You've got to\nmake a bargain! I've got the fuel-block! You can't lift off without the\nfuel-block! You've got to make a deal._\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe other men came back. With the microphone still muffled by his hand,\nMoran said sharply, \"He has to keep talking until we answer, but he\nwon't know we're on his trail until we do. We keep quiet when we get the\nhelmets on. Understand?\" Then he said evenly to Carol. \"Look at that\npaper I showed you if--if anything happens. Don't forget! Ready?\"\n\nCarol's hands were clenched. She was terribly pale. She tried to speak,\nand could not. Moran, with the microphone still covered by the palm of\nhis hand, repeated urgently;\n\n\"Remember, no talking! He'll pick up anything we say. Use gestures.\nLet's go!\"\n\nHe swung out of the airlock. The others followed. The one certain thing\nabout the direction Hallet would have taken was that it must be away\nfrom the wreck. And he'd have been in a panic to get out of sight from\nthe yacht.\n\nMoran saw his starting-point at once. Landing, the _Nadine_ had used\nrockets for easing to ground because it is not possible to make delicate\nadjustments of interplanetary drive. A take-off, yes. But to land even\nat a space-port one uses rockets to cushion what otherwise might be a\nsharp impact. The _Nadine's_ rockets had burned away the yeasty soil\nwhen she came to ground. There was a burnt-away depression down to\nbed-rock in the stuff all around her. But Hallet had broken the\nscorched, crusty edge of the hollow as he climbed up to the blanket-like\nsurface-skin.\n\nMoran led the way after him. He moved with confidence. The\nspringy, sickeningly uncertain stuff underfoot was basically\nwhite-that-had-been-soiled. Between the _Nadine's_ landing-spot and the\nnow-gutted wreck, it happened that only that one color showed. But,\nscattered at random in other places, there were patches of red mould and\nblue mould and black dusty rust and greenish surface-fungi. Twenty yards\nfrom the depression in which the _Nadine_ lay, Hallet's footprints were\nclearly marked in a patch of orange-yellow ground-cover which gave off\nimpalpable yellow spores when touched. Moran gestured for attention and\npointed out the trail. He gestured again for the others to spread out.\n\nHallet's voice came again. He'd left the _Nadine's_ lock because he\ncould make no bargain for his life while in the hands of his companions.\nHe could only bargain for his life if they could not find him or the\nprecious fuel-block without which the _Nadine_ must remain here forever.\nBut from the beginning he knew such terror that he could not contrive,\nhimself, a bargain that could possibly be made.\n\nHe chattered agitatedly, not yet sure that his escape had been\ndiscovered. At times he seemed almost hysterical. Moran and the others\ncould hear him pant, sometimes, as a fancied movement aroused his panic.\nOnce they heard the noise of his torch as he burned a safety-hole in the\nground. But he did not use it. He hastened on. He talked desperately.\nSometimes he boasted, and sometimes he tried cunningly to be reasonable.\nBut he hadn't been prepared for the absolute failure of what should have\nbeen the simplest and surest form of multiple murder. Now in a last\nditch stand, he hysterically abused them for taking so long to realize\nthat they had to make a deal.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis four pursuers went grimly over the elastic surface of this world\nupon his trail. The _Nadine_ faded into the mist. Off to the right a\nclump of toadstools grew. They were taller than any of the men, and\ntheir pulpy stalks were more than a foot thick. Hallet's trail in the\ncolored surface-moulds went on. The giant toadstools were left behind.\nThe trail led straight toward an enormous object the height of a\nthree-storey house. When first glimpsed through the mist, it looked\nartificial. But as they drew near they saw that it was a cabbage;\ngigantic, with leaves impossibly huge and thick. There was a spike in\nits middle on which grew cruciform faded flowers four feet across.\n\nThen Hallet screamed. They heard it in their helmet-phones. He screamed\nagain. Then for a space he was silent, gasping, and then he uttered\nshrieks of pure horror. But they were cries of horror, not of pain.\n\nMoran found himself running, which was probably ridiculous. The others\nhastened after him. And suddenly the mistiness ahead took on a new\nappearance. The ground fell away. It became evident that the _Nadine_\nhad landed upon a plateau with levels below it and very possibly\nmountains rising above. But here the slightly rolling plateau fell sheer\naway. There was a place where the yeasty soil--but here it was tinted\nwith a purplish overcast of foleate fungus--where the soil had given\nway. Something had fallen, here.\n\nIt would have been Hallet. He'd gone too close to a precipice, moving\nagitatedly in search of a hiding-place in which to conceal himself until\nthe people of the _Nadine_ made a deal he could no longer believe in.\n\nHis cries still came over the helmet-phones. Moran went grimly to look.\nHe found himself gazing down into a crossvalley perhaps two hundred feet\ndeep. At the bottom there was the incredible, green growing things. But\nthey were not trees. They were some flabby weed with thick reddish\nstalks and enormous pinnate leaves. It grew here to the height of oaks.\nBut Hallet had not dropped so far.\n\nFrom anchorages on bare rock, great glistening cables reached downward\nto other anchorages on the valley floor. The cables crossed each other\nwith highly artificial precision at a central point. They formed the\nfoundation for a web of geometrically accurate design and unthinkable\nsize. Crosscables of sticky stuff went round and round the center of the\nenormous snare, following a logarithmic spiral with absolute exactitude.\nIt was a spider's web whose cables stretched hundreds of feet; whose\nbird-limed ropes would trap and hold even the monster insects of this\nworld. And Hallet was caught in it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe'd tumbled from the cliff-edge as fungoid soil gave way under him.\nHe'd bounced against a sloping, fungus-covered rocky wall and with\nfragments of curdy stuff about him had been flung out and into the\nsnare. He was caught as firmly as any of the other creatures on which\nthe snare's owner fed.\n\nHis shrieks of horror began when he realized his situation. He\nstruggled, setting up insane vibrations in the fabric of the web. He\nshrieked again, trying to break the bonds of cordage that clung the more\nhorribly as he struggled to break free. And the struggling was most\nunwise.\n\n\"We want to cut the cables with torches,\" said Moran sharply. \"If we can\nmake the web drop we'll be all right. Webspiders don't hunt on the\nground. Go ahead! Make it fast!\"\n\nBurleigh and the others hastened to what looked like a nearly\npracticable place by which to descend. Moran moved swiftly to where one\ncable of the web was made fast at the top. It was simple sanity to break\ndown the web--by degrees, of course--to get at Hallet. But Hallet did\nnot cooperate. He writhed and struggled and shrieked.\n\nHis outcry, of course, counted for nothing in the satanic cacophony that\nfilled the air. All the monsters of all the planet seemed to make\ndiscordant noises. Hallet could add nothing. But his struggles in the\nweb had meaning to the owner of the trap.\n\nThey sent tiny tremblings down the web-cables. And this was the fine\nmathematical creation of what was quaintly called a \"garden spider\" on\nother worlds. _Epeira fasciata._ She was not in it. She sat sluggishly\nin a sheltered place, remote from her snare. But a line, a cord, a\nsignal-cable went from the center of the web to the spider's retreat.\nShe waited with implacable patience, one foreleg--sheathed in ragged and\nsomehow revolting fur--resting delicately upon the line. Hallet's\nfrantic struggles shook the web. Faintly, to be sure, but distinctively.\nThe vibrations were wholly unlike the violent, thrashing struggles of a\nheavy beetle or a giant cricket. They were equally unlike those\nflirtatious, seductive pluckings of a web-cable which would mean that an\namorous male of her own species sought the grisly creature's affection.\n\nHallet made the web quiver as small prey would shake it. The spider\nwould have responded instantly to bigger game, if only to secure it\nbefore the vast snare was damaged by frenzied plungings. Still, though\nthere was no haste, the giant rose and in leisurely fashion traversed\nthe long cable to the web's center. Moran saw it.\n\n\"Hallet!\" he barked into his helmet-phone, \"Hallet! Hold still! Don't\nmove!\"\n\nHe raced desperately along the edge of the cliff, risking a fall more\nimmediately fatal than Hallet's. It was idiotic to make such an attempt\nat rescue. It was sheer folly. But there are instincts one has to obey\nagainst all reason. Moran did not think of the fuel-block. Typically,\nHallet did.\n\n\"_I've got the fuel-block_,\" he gasped between screams. \"_If you don't\nhelp me--_\"\n\nBut then the main cable nearest him moved in a manner not the result of\nhis own struggles. It was the enormous weight of the owner of the web,\nmoving leisurely on her own snare, which made the web shake now. And\nHallet lost even the coherence of hysteria and simply shrieked.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMoran came to a place where a main anchor-cable reached bed-rock. It ran\nunder yeasty ground-cover to an anchorage. He thrust his torch deep,\nfeeling for the cable. It seared through. The web jerked wildly as one\nof its principal supports parted. The giant spider turned aside to\ninvestigate the event. Such a thing should happen only when one of the\nmost enormous of possible victims became entangled.\n\nMoran went racing for another cable-anchorage. But when he found where\nthe strong line fastened, it was simply and starkly impossible to climb\ndown to it. He swore and looked desperately for Burleigh and Brawn and\nHarper. They were far away, hurrying to descend but not yet where they\ncould bring the web toppling down by cutting other cables.\n\nThe yellow-banded monster came to the cut end of the line. It swung\ndown. It climbed up again. Hallet shrieked and kicked.\n\nThe spider moved toward him. Of all nightmarish creatures on this\nnightmare of a planet, a giant spider with a body eight feet long and\nlegs to span as many yards was most revolting. Its abdomen was obscenely\nswollen. As it moved, its spinnerets paid out newly-formed cord behind\nit. Its eyes were monstrous and murderously intent. The ghastly,\nneedle-sharp mandibles beside its mouth seemed to move lustfully with a\nlife of their own. And it was somehow ten times more horrible because of\nits beastly fur. Tufts of black hairiness, half-yards in length,\nstreamed out as its legs moved.\n\nThere was another cable still. Moran made for it. He reached it where it\nstretched down like a slanting tight-rope. He jerked out his torch to\nsever it,--and saw that to cut it would be to drop the spider almost\nupon Hallet. It would seize him then because of his writhings. But not\nto cut it--\n\nHe tried his blaster. He fired again and again. The blaster-bolts hurt.\nThe spider reacted with fury. The blaster would have killed a man at\nthis distance, though it would have been ignored by a chitin-armored\nbeetle. But against the spider the bolts were like bites. They made\nsmall wounds, but not serious ones. The spider made a bubbling sound\nwhich was more daunting than any cry would have been. It flung its legs\nabout, fumbling for the thing that it believed attacked it. It continued\nthe bubbling sounds. Its mandibles clashed and gnashed against each\nother. They were small noises in the din which was the norm on this mad\nworld, but they were more horrible than any other sounds Moran had ever\nheard.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe spider suddenly began to move purposefully toward the spot where\nHallet jerked insanely and shrieked in heart-rending horror.\n\nMoran found himself attempting the impossible. He knew it was\nimpossible. The blast-pistol hurt but did not injure the giant because\nthe range was too long. So--it was totally unjustifiable--he found\nhimself slung below the downward-slanting cable and sliding down its\nslope. He was going to where the range would be short enough for his\nblast-pistol to be effective. He slid to a cross-cable, and avoided it\nand went on.\n\nBurleigh and Brawn and Harper were tiny figures, very far away. Moran\nhung by one hand and used his free hand to fire the blaster once more.\nIt hurt more seriously, now. The spider made bubbling noises of infinite\nferocity. And it moved with incredible agility toward the one object it\ncould imagine as meaning attack.\n\nIt reached Hallet. It seized him.\n\nMoran's blast-pistol could not kill it. It had to be killed. Now! He\ndrew out his torch and pressed the continuous-flame stud. Raging, he\nthrew it at the spider.\n\nIt spun in the air, a strange blue-white pinwheel in the gray light of\nthis planet's day. It cut through a cable that might have deflected it.\nIt reached the spider, now reared high and pulling Hallet from the\nsticky stuff that had captured him.\n\nThe spinning torch hit. The flame burned deep. The torch actually sank\ninto the spider's body.\n\nAnd there was a titanic flame and an incredible blast and Moran knew\nnothing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA long time later he knew that he ached. He became aware that he hurt.\nStill later he realized that Burleigh and Brawn and Harper stood around\nhim. He'd splashed in some enormous thickness of the yeasty soil, grown\nand fallen from the cliff-edge, and it was not solid enough to break his\nbones. Harper, doubtless, had been most resolute in digging down to him\nand pulling him out.\n\nHe sat up, and growled at innumerable unpleasant sensations.\n\n\"That,\" he said painfully, \"was a very bad business.\"\n\n\"It's all bad business,\" said Burleigh in a flat and somehow exhausted\ntone. \"The fuel-block burned. There's nothing left of it or Hallet or\nthe spider.\"\n\nMoran moved an arm. A leg. The other arm and leg. He got unsteadily to\nhis feet.\n\n\"It was bessendium and uranium,\" added Burleigh hopelessly. \"And the\nuranium burned. It wasn't an atomic explosion, it just burned like\nsodium or potassium would do. But it burned fast! The torch-flame must\nhave reached it.\" He added absurdly. \"Hallet died instantly, of course.\nWhich is better fortune than we are likely to have.\"\n\n\"Oh, that ...\" said Moran. \"We're all right. I said I was going to kill\nhim. I wasn't trying to at the moment, but I did. By accident.\" He\npaused, and said dizzily; \"I think he should feel obliged to me. I was\ndistinctly charitable to him!\"\n\nHarper said grimly;\n\n\"But we can't lift off. We're all marooned here now.\"\n\nMoran took an experimental step. He hurt, but he was sound.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" he said. \"The crew of the _Malabar_ went off without taking\nthe fuel-block from the wreck's engines. It's in a drawer in the\n_Nadine's_ control-room with a note to Carol that I asked her to read\nshould something happen to me. We may have to machine it a little to\nmake it fit the _Nadine's_ engines. But we're all right!\"\n\nCarol's voice came in his helmet-phone. It was shaky and desperately\nglad.\n\n\"_You're--all right? Quite all right? Please hurry back?_\"\n\n\"We're on the way,\" said Moran.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was pleased with Carol's reaction. He also realized that now there\nwould be the right number of people on the _Nadine_; they would take off\nfrom this world and arrive reasonably near due-time at Loris without\narousing the curiosity of space-port officials.\n\nHe looked about him. The way the others had come down was a perfectly\ngood way to climb up again. On the surface, above, their trail would be\nclear on the multi-colored surface rusts. There were four men together,\nall with blast-pistols and three with torches. They should be safe.\n\nMoran talked cheerfully, climbing to the plateau on which the _Nadine_\nhad landed, trudging with the others across a world on which it was\nimpossible to see more than a quarter-mile in any direction. But the way\nwas plain. Beyond the mist Carol waited.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Planet of Dread, by Murray Leinster\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PLANET OF DREAD ***\n\n***** This file should be named 43046-8.txt or 43046-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/4/3/0/4/43046/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
