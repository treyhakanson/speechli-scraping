Yet his doom was this:\n            He could not see what he must learn of his own!\n\n\nSoft as the voice of a mourning dove, the telephone sounded at Rufus\nSollenar's desk. Sollenar himself was standing fifty paces away, his\nleonine head cocked, his hands flat in his hip pockets, watching the\nnighted world through the crystal wall that faced out over Manhattan\nIsland. The window was so high that some of what he saw was dimmed by\nlow clouds hovering over the rivers. Above him were stars; below him\nthe city was traced out in light and brimming with light. A falling\nstar--an interplanetary rocket--streaked down toward Long Island\nFacility like a scratch across the soot on the doors of Hell.\n\nSollenar's eyes took it in, but he was watching the total scene, not\nany particular part of it. His eyes were shining.\n\nWhen he heard the telephone, he raised his left hand to his lips.\n\"Yes?\" The hand glittered with utilijem rings; the effect was that\nof an attempt at the sort of copper-binding that was once used to\nreinforce the ribbing of wooden warships.\n\nHis personal receptionist's voice moved from the air near his desk\nto the air near his ear. Seated at the monitor board in her office,\nwherever in this building her office was, the receptionist told him:\n\n\"Mr. Ermine says he has an appointment.\"\n\n\"No.\" Sollenar dropped his hand and returned to his panorama. When he\nhad been twenty years younger--managing the modest optical factory that\nhad provided the support of three generations of Sollenars--he had very\nmuch wanted to be able to stand in a place like this, and feel as he\nimagined men felt in such circumstances. But he felt unimaginable, now.\n\nTo be here was one thing. To have almost lost the right, and regained\nit at the last moment, was another. Now he knew that not only could he\nbe here today but that tomorrow, and tomorrow, he could still be here.\nHe had won. His gamble had given him EmpaVid--and EmpaVid would give\nhim all.\n\nThe city was not merely a prize set down before his eyes. It was a\ndynamic system he had proved he could manipulate. He and the city were\none. It buoyed and sustained him; it supported him, here in the air,\nwith stars above and light-thickened mist below.\n\nThe telephone mourned: \"Mr. Ermine states he has a firm appointment.\"\n\n\"I've never heard of him.\" And the left hand's utilijems fell from\nSollenar's lips again. He enjoyed such toys. He raised his right hand,\nsheathed in insubstantial midnight-blue silk in which the silver\nthreads of metallic wiring ran subtly toward the fingertips. He raised\nthe hand, and touched two fingers together: music began to play behind\nand before him. He made contact between another combination of finger\ncircuits, and a soft, feminine laugh came from the terrace at the other\nside of the room, where connecting doors had opened. He moved toward\nit. One layer of translucent drapery remained across the doorway,\nbillowing lightly in the breeze from the terrace. Through it, he saw\nthe taboret with its candle lit; the iced wine in the stand beside it;\nthe two fragile chairs; Bess Allardyce, slender and regal, waiting in\none of them--all these, through the misty curtain, like either the\nbeginning or the end of a dream.\n\n\"Mr. Ermine reminds you the appointment was made for him at the Annual\nBusiness Dinner of the International Association of Broadcasters, in\n1998.\"\n\nSollenar completed his latest step, then stopped. He frowned down at\nhis left hand. \"Is Mr. Ermine with the IAB's Special Public Relations\nOffice?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the voice said after a pause.\n\nThe fingers of Sollenar's right hand shrank into a cone. The\nconnecting door closed. The girl disappeared. The music stopped. \"All\nright. You can tell Mr. Ermine to come up.\" Sollenar went to sit behind\nhis desk.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe office door chimed. Sollenar crooked a finger of his left hand, and\nthe door opened. With another gesture, he kindled the overhead lights\nnear the door and sat in shadow as Mr. Ermine came in.\n\nErmine was dressed in rust-colored garments. His figure was spare,\nand his hands were empty. His face was round and soft, with long dark\nsideburns. His scalp was bald. He stood just inside Sollenar's office\nand said: \"I would like some light to see you by, Mr. Sollenar.\"\n\nSollenar crooked his little finger.\n\nThe overhead lights came to soft light all over the office. The crystal\nwall became a mirror, with only the strongest city lights glimmering\nthrough it. \"I only wanted to see you first,\" said Sollenar; \"I thought\nperhaps we'd met before.\"\n\n\"No,\" Ermine said, walking across the office. \"It's not likely you've\never seen me.\" He took a card case out of his pocket and showed\nSollenar proper identification. \"I'm not a very forward person.\"\n\n\"Please sit down,\" Sollenar said. \"What may I do for you?\"\n\n\"At the moment, Mr. Sollenar, I'm doing something for you.\"\n\nSollenar sat back in his chair. \"Are you? Are you, now?\" He frowned at\nErmine. \"When I became a party to the By-Laws passed at the '98 Dinner,\nI thought a Special Public Relations Office would make a valuable asset\nto the organization. Consequently, I voted for it, and for the powers\nit was given. But I never expected to have any personal dealings with\nit. I barely remembered you people had carte blanche with any IAB\nmember.\"\n\n\"Well, of course, it's been a while since '98,\" Ermine said. \"I imagine\nsome legends have grown up around us. Industry gossip--that sort of\nthing.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But we don't restrict ourselves to an enforcement function, Mr.\nSollenar. You haven't broken any By-Laws, to our knowledge.\"\n\n\"Or mine. But nobody feels one hundred per cent secure. Not under\nthese circumstances.\" Nor did Sollenar yet relax his face into its\nmagnificent smile. \"I'm sure you've found that out.\"\n\n\"I have a somewhat less ambitious older brother who's with the Federal\nBureau of Investigation. When I embarked on my own career, he told me\nI could expect everyone in the world to react like a criminal, yes,\"\nErmine said, paying no attention to Sollenar's involuntary blink. \"It's\none of the complicating factors in a profession like my brother's, or\nmine. But I'm here to advise you, Mr. Sollenar. Only that.\"\n\n\"In what matter, Mr. Ermine?\"\n\n\"Well, your corporation recently came into control of the patents\nfor a new video system. I understand that this in effect makes\nyour corporation the licensor for an extremely valuable sales and\nentertainment medium. Fantastically valuable.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"EmpaVid,\" Sollenar agreed. \"Various subliminal stimuli are broadcast\nwith and keyed to the overt subject matter. The home receiving unit\ncontains feedback sensors which determine the viewer's reaction to\nthese stimuli, and intensify some while playing down others in order to\ncreate complete emotional rapport between the viewer and the subject\nmatter. EmpaVid, in other words, is a system for orchestrating the\nviewer's emotions. The home unit is self-contained, semi-portable and\nnot significantly bulkier than the standard TV receiver. EmpaVid is\ncompatible with standard TV receivers--except, of course, that the\nsubject matter seems thin and vaguely unsatisfactory on a standard\nreceiver. So the consumer shortly purchases an EV unit.\" It pleased\nSollenar to spell out the nature of his prize.\n\n\"At a very reasonable price. Quite so, Mr. Sollenar. But you had\nseveral difficulties in finding potential licensees for this system,\namong the networks.\"\n\nSollenar's lips pinched out.\n\nMr. Ermine raised one finger. \"First, there was the matter of acquiring\nthe patents from the original inventor, who was also approached by\nCortwright Burr.\"\n\n\"Yes, he was,\" Sollenar said in a completely new voice.\n\n\"Competition between Mr. Burr and yourself is long-standing and\nintense.\"\n\n\"Quite intense,\" Sollenar said, looking directly ahead of him at the\none blank wall of the office. Burr's offices were several blocks\ndowntown, in that direction.\n\n\"Well, I have no wish to enlarge on that point, Mr. Burr being an IAB\nmember in standing as good as yours, Mr. Sollenar. There was, in any\ncase, a further difficulty in licensing EV, due to the very heavy cost\ninvolved in equipping broadcasting stations and network relay equipment\nfor this sort of transmission.\"\n\n\"Yes, there was.\"\n\n\"Ultimately, however, you succeeded. You pointed out, quite rightly,\nthat if just one station made the change, and if just a few EV\nreceivers were put into public places within the area served by that\nstation, normal TV outlets could not possibly compete for advertising\nrevenue.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And so your last difficulties were resolved a few days ago, when\nyour EmpaVid Unlimited--pardon me; when EmpaVid, a subsidiary of the\nSollenar Corporation--became a major stockholder in the Transworld TV\nNetwork.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I don't understand, Mr. Ermine,\" Sollenar said. \"Why are you\nrecounting this? Are you trying to demonstrate the power of your\nknowledge? All these transactions are already matters of record in the\nIAB confidential files, in accordance with the By-Laws.\"\n\nErmine held up another finger. \"You're forgetting I'm only here to\nadvise you. I have two things to say. They are:\n\n\"These transactions are on file with the IAB because they involve\na great number of IAB members, and an increasingly large amount of\ncapital. Also, Transworld's exclusivity, under the IAB By-Laws, will\nhold good only until thirty-three per cent market saturation has been\nreached. If EV is as good as it looks, that will be quite soon. After\nthat, under the By-Laws, Transworld will be restrained from making\neffective defenses against patent infringement by competitors. Then\nall of the IAB's membership and much of their capital will be involved\nwith EV. Much of that capital is already in anticipatory motion. So a\nhighly complex structure now ultimately depends on the integrity of the\nSollenar Corporation. If Sollenar stock falls in value, not just you\nbut many IAB members will be greatly embarrassed. Which is another way\nof saying EV must succeed.\"\n\n\"I know all that! What of it? There's no risk. I've had every related\npatent on Earth checked. There will be no catastrophic obsolescence of\nthe EV system.\"\n\nErmine said: \"There are engineers on Mars. Martian engineers. They're a\ndying race, but no one knows what they can still do.\"\n\nSollenar raised his massive head.\n\nErmine said: \"Late this evening, my office learned that Cortwright Burr\nhas been in close consultation with the Martians for several weeks.\nThey have made some sort of machine for him. He was on the flight that\nlanded at the Facility a few moments ago.\"\n\nSollenar's fists clenched. The lights crashed off and on, and the room\nwailed. From the terrace came a startled cry, and a sound of smashed\nglass.\n\nMr. Ermine nodded, excused himself and left.\n\n--A few moments later, Mr. Ermine stepped out at the pedestrian level\nof the Sollenar Building. He strolled through the landscaped garden,\nand across the frothing brook toward the central walkway down the\nAvenue. He paused at a hedge to pluck a blossom and inhale its odor. He\nwalked away, holding it in his naked fingers.\n\n\nII\n\nDrifting slowly on the thread of his spinneret, Rufus Sollenar came\ngliding down the wind above Cortwright Burr's building.\n\nThe building, like a spider, touched the ground at only the points of\nits legs. It held its wide, low bulk spread like a parasol over several\ndowntown blocks. Sollenar, manipulating the helium-filled plastic\ndrifter far above him, steered himself with jets of compressed gas from\nplastic bottles in the drifter's structure.\n\nOnly Sollenar himself, in all this system, was not effectively\ntransparent to the municipal anti-plane radar. And he himself was\nwrapped in long, fluttering streamers of dull black, metallic sheeting.\nTo the eye, he was amorphous and non-reflective. To electronic sensors,\nhe was a drift of static much like a sheet of foil picked by the wind\nfrom some careless trash heap. To all of the senses of all interested\nparties he was hardly there at all--and, thus, in an excellent position\nfor murder.\n\nHe fluttered against Burr's window. There was the man, crouched over\nhis desk. What was that in his hands--a pomander?\n\nSollenar clipped his harness to the edges of the cornice. Swayed out\nagainst it, his sponge-soled boots pressed to the glass, he touched his\nleft hand to the window and described a circle. He pushed; there was a\nthud on the carpeting in Burr's office, and now there was no barrier to\nSollenar. Doubling his knees against his chest, he catapulted forward,\nthe riot pistol in his right hand. He stumbled and fell to his knees,\nbut the gun was up.\n\nBurr jolted up behind his desk. The little sphere of orange-gold metal,\nstreaked with darker bronze, its surface vermicular with encrustations,\nwas still in his hands. \"Him!\" Burr cried out as Sollenar fired.\n\nGasping, Sollenar watched the charge strike Burr. It threw his torso\nbackward faster than his limbs and head could follow without dangling.\nThe choked-down pistol was nearly silent. Burr crashed backward to end,\ntransfixed, against the wall.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPale and sick, Sollenar moved to take the golden ball. He wondered\nwhere Shakespeare could have seen an example such as this, to know an\nold man could have so much blood in him.\n\nBurr held the prize out to him. Staring with eyes distended by\nhydrostatic pressure, his clothing raddled and his torso grinding\nits broken bones, Burr stalked away from the wall and moved as if to\nembrace Sollenar. It was queer, but he was not dead.\n\nShuddering, Sollenar fired again.\n\nAgain Burr was thrown back. The ball spun from his splayed fingers as\nhe once more marked the wall with his body.\n\nPomander, orange, whatever--it looked valuable.\n\nSollenar ran after the rolling ball. And Burr moved to intercept him,\nnearly faceless, hunched under a great invisible weight that slowly\nyielded as his back groaned.\n\nSollenar took a single backward step.\n\nBurr took a step toward him. The golden ball lay in a far corner.\nSollenar raised the pistol despairingly and fired again. Burr tripped\nbackward on tiptoe, his arms like windmills, and fell atop the prize.\n\nTears ran down Sollenar's cheeks. He pushed one foot forward ... and\nBurr, in his corner, lifted his head and began to gather his body for\nthe effort of rising.\n\nSollenar retreated to the window, the pistol sledging backward against\nhis wrist and elbow as he fired the remaining shots in the magazine.\n\nPanting, he climbed up into the window frame and clipped the harness\nto his body, craning to look over his shoulder ... as Burr--shredded;\nleaking blood and worse than blood--advanced across the office.\n\nHe cast off his holds on the window frame and clumsily worked the\ndrifter controls. Far above him, volatile ballast spilled out and\ndispersed in the air long before it touched ground. Sollenar rose,\nsobbing--\n\nAnd Burr stood in the window, his shattered hands on the edges of the\ncut circle, raising his distended eyes steadily to watch Sollenar in\nflight across the enigmatic sky.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhere he landed, on the roof of a building in his possession, Sollenar\nhad a disposal unit for his gun and his other trappings. He deferred\nfor a time the question of why Burr had failed at once to die.\nEmpty-handed, he returned uptown.\n\nHe entered his office, called and told his attorneys the exact times of\ndeparture and return and knew the question of dealing with municipal\nauthorities was thereby resolved. That was simple enough, with no\nwitnesses to complicate the matter. He began to wish he hadn't been so\nirresolute as to leave Burr without the thing he was after. Surely,\nif the pistol hadn't killed the man--an old man, with thin limbs and\nspotted skin--he could have wrestled that thin-limbed, bloody old man\naside--that spotted old man--and dragged himself and his prize back\nto the window, for all that the old man would have clung to him, and\nclutched at his legs, and fumbled for a handhold on his somber disguise\nof wrappings--that broken, immortal old man.\n\nSollenar raised his hand. The great window to the city grew opaque.\n\nBess Allardyce knocked softly on the door from the terrace. He would\nhave thought she'd returned to her own apartments many hours ago.\nTortuously pleased, he opened the door and smiled at her, feeling the\ndried tears crack on the skin of his cheeks.\n\nHe took her proffered hands. \"You waited for me,\" he sighed. \"A long\ntime for anyone as beautiful as you to wait.\"\n\nShe smiled back at him. \"Let's go out and look at the stars.\"\n\n\"Isn't it chilly?\"\n\n\"I made spiced hot cider for us. We can sip it and think.\"\n\nHe let her draw him out onto the terrace. He leaned on the parapet,\nhis arm around her pulsing waist, his cape drawn around both their\nshoulders.\n\n\"Bess, I won't ask if you'd stay with me no matter what the\ncircumstances. But it might be a time will come when I couldn't bear to\nlive in this city. What about that?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" she answered honestly.\n\nAnd Cortwright Burr put his hand up over the edge of the parapet,\nbetween them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSollenar stared down at the straining knuckles, holding the entire\nweight of the man dangling against the sheer face of the building.\nThere was a sliding, rustling noise, and the other hand came up,\nsearched blindly for a hold and found it, hooked over the stone. The\nfingers tensed and rose, their tips flattening at the pressure as Burr\ntried to pull his head and shoulders up to the level of the parapet.\n\nBess breathed: \"Oh, look at them! He must have torn them terribly\nclimbing up!\" Then she pulled away from Sollenar and stood staring at\nhim, her hand to her mouth. \"But he _couldn't_ have climbed! We're so\nhigh!\"\n\nSollenar beat at the hands with the heels of his palms, using the\ndirect, trained blows he had learned at his athletic club.\n\nBone splintered against the stone. When the knuckles were broken\nthe hands instantaneously disappeared, leaving only streaks behind\nthem. Sollenar looked over the parapet. A bundle shrank from sight,\nsilhouetted against the lights of the pedestrian level and the Avenue.\nIt contracted to a pinpoint. Then, when it reached the brook and water\nflew in all directions, it disappeared in a final sunburst, endowed\nwith glory by the many lights which found momentary reflection down\nthere.\n\n\"Bess, leave me! Leave me, please!\" Rufus Sollenar cried out.\n\n\nIII\n\nRufus Sollenar paced his office, his hands held safely still in front\nof him, their fingers spread and rigid.\n\nThe telephone sounded, and his secretary said to him: \"Mr. Sollenar,\nyou are ten minutes from being late at the TTV Executives' Ball. This\nis a First Class obligation.\"\n\nSollenar laughed. \"I thought it was, when I originally classified it.\"\n\n\"Are you now planning to renege, Mr. Sollenar?\" the secretary inquired\npolitely.\n\nCertainly, Sollenar thought. He could as easily renege on the Ball as\na king could on his coronation.\n\n\"Burr, you scum, what have you done to me?\" he asked the air, and the\ntelephone said: \"Beg pardon?\"\n\n\"Tell my valet,\" Sollenar said. \"I'm going.\" He dismissed the phone.\nHis hands cupped in front of his chest. A firm grip on emptiness might\nbe stronger than any prize in a broken hand.\n\nCarrying in his chest something he refused to admit was terror,\nSollenar made ready for the Ball.\n\nBut only a few moments after the first dance set had ended, Malcolm\nLevier of the local TTV station executive staff looked over Sollenar's\nshoulder and remarked:\n\n\"Oh, there's Cort Burr, dressed like a gallows bird.\"\n\nSollenar, glittering in the costume of the Medici, did not turn his\nhead. \"Is he? What would he want here?\"\n\nLevier's eyebrows arched. \"He holds a little stock. He has entree. But\nhe's late.\" Levier's lips quirked. \"It must have taken him some time to\nget that makeup on.\"\n\n\"Not in good taste, is it?\"\n\n\"Look for yourself.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll do better than that,\" Sollenar said. \"I'll go and talk to him\na while. Excuse me, Levier.\" And only then did he turn around, already\nstarted on his first pace toward the man.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut Cortwright Burr was only a pasteboard imitation of himself as\nSollenar had come to know him. He stood to one side of the doorway,\ndressed in black and crimson robes, with black leather gauntlets on\nhis hands, carrying a staff of weathered, natural wood. His face was\nshadowed by a sackcloth hood, the eyes well hidden. His face was\npowdered gray, and some blend of livid colors hollowed his cheeks. He\nstood motionless as Sollenar came up to him.\n\nAs he had crossed the floor, each step regular, the eyes of bystanders\nhad followed Sollenar, until, anticipating his course, they found Burr\nwaiting. The noise level of the Ball shrank perceptibly, for the lesser\nrevelers who chanced to be present were sustaining it all alone. The\npeople who really mattered here were silent and watchful.\n\nThe thought was that Burr, defeated in business, had come here in some\ninsane reproach to his adversary, in this lugubrious, distasteful\nclothing. Why, he looked like a corpse. Or worse.\n\nThe question was, what would Sollenar say to him? The wish was that\nBurr would take himself away, back to his estates or to some other\ncity. New York was no longer for Cortwright Burr. But what would\nSollenar say to him now, to drive him back to where he hadn't the\ngrace to go willingly?\n\n\"Cortwright,\" Sollenar said in a voice confined to the two of them. \"So\nyour Martian immortality works.\"\n\nBurr said nothing.\n\n\"You got that in addition, didn't you? You knew how I'd react. You\nknew you'd need protection. Paid the Martians to make you physically\ninvulnerable? It's a good system. Very impressive. Who would have\nthought the Martians knew so much? But who here is going to pay\nattention to you now? Get out of town, Cortwright. You're past your\nchance. You're dead as far as these people are concerned--all you have\nleft is your skin.\"\n\nBurr reached up and surreptitiously lifted a corner of his fleshed\nmask. And there he was, under it. The hood retreated an inch, and the\nlight reached his eyes; and Sollenar had been wrong, Burr had less left\nthan he thought.\n\n\"Oh, no, no, Cortwright,\" Sollenar said softly. \"No, you're right--I\ncan't stand up to that.\"\n\nHe turned and bowed to the assembled company. \"Good night!\" he cried,\nand walked out of the ballroom.\n\nSomeone followed him down the corridor to the elevators. Sollenar did\nnot look behind him.\n\n\"I have another appointment with you now,\" Ermine said at his elbow.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey reached the pedestrian level. Sollenar said: \"There's a cafe. We\ncan talk there.\"\n\n\"Too public, Mr. Sollenar. Let's simply stroll and converse.\" Ermine\nlightly took his arm and guided him along the walkway. Sollenar noticed\nthen that Ermine was costumed so cunningly that no one could have\nguessed the appearance of the man.\n\n\"Very well,\" Sollenar said.\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\nThey walked together, casually. Ermine said: \"Burr's driving you to\nyour death. Is it because you tried to kill him earlier? Did you get\nhis Martian secret?\"\n\nSollenar shook his head.\n\n\"You didn't get it.\" Ermine sighed. \"That's unfortunate. I'll have to\ntake steps.\"\n\n\"Under the By-Laws,\" Sollenar said, \"I cry _laissez faire_.\"\n\nErmine looked up, his eyes twinkling. \"_Laissez faire?_ Mr. Sollenar,\ndo you have any idea how many of our members are involved in your\nfortunes? _They_ will cry _laissez faire_, Mr. Sollenar, but clearly\nyou persist in dragging them down with you. No, sir, Mr. Sollenar,\nmy office now forwards an immediate recommendation to the Technical\nAdvisory Committee of the IAB that Mr. Burr probably has a system\nsuperior to yours, and that stock in Sollenar, Incorporated, had best\nbe disposed of.\"\n\n\"There's a bench,\" Sollenar said. \"Let's sit down.\"\n\n\"As you wish.\" Ermine moved beside Sollenar to the bench, but remained\nstanding.\n\n\"What is it, Mr. Sollenar?\"\n\n\"I want your help. You advised me on what Burr had. It's still in his\noffice building, somewhere. You have resources. We can get it.\"\n\n\"_Laissez faire_, Mr. Sollenar. I visited you in an advisory capacity.\nI can do no more.\"\n\n\"For a partnership in my affairs could you do more?\"\n\n\"Money?\" Ermine tittered. \"For me? Do you know the conditions of my\nemployment?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIf he had thought, Sollenar would have remembered. He reached out\ntentatively. Ermine anticipated him.\n\nErmine bared his left arm and sank his teeth into it. He displayed\nthe arm. There was no quiver of pain in voice or stance. \"It's not a\nlegend, Mr. Sollenar. It's quite true. We of our office must spend a\nyear, after the nerve surgery, learning to walk without the feel of our\nfeet, to handle objects without crushing them or letting them slip, or\ndamaging ourselves. Our mundane pleasures are auditory, olfactory, and\nvisual. Easily gratified at little expense. Our dreams are totally\ninterior, Mr. Sollenar. The operation is irreversible. What would you\nbuy for me with your money?\"\n\n\"What would I buy for myself?\" Sollenar's head sank down between his\nshoulders.\n\nErmine bent over him. \"Your despair is your own, Mr. Sollenar. I have\nofficial business with you.\"\n\nHe lifted Sollenar's chin with a forefinger. \"I judge physical\ninterference to be unwarranted at this time. But matters must remain\nso that the IAB members involved with you can recover the value of\ntheir investments in EV. Is that perfectly clear, Mr. Sollenar? You are\nhereby enjoined under the By-Laws, as enforced by the Special Public\nRelations Office.\" He glanced at his watch. \"Notice was served at 1:27\nAM, City time.\"\n\n\"1:27,\" Sollenar said. \"City time.\" He sprang to his feet and raced\ndown a companionway to the taxi level.\n\nMr. Ermine watched him quizzically.\n\nHe opened his costume, took out his omnipresent medical kit, and\nsprayed coagulant over the wound in his forearm. Replacing the kit, he\nadjusted his clothing and strolled down the same companionway Sollenar\nhad run. He raised an arm, and a taxi flittered down beside him. He\nshowed the driver a card, and the cab lifted off with him, its lights\nglaring in a Priority pattern, far faster than Sollenar's ordinary\nlegal limit allowed.\n\n\nIV\n\nLong Island Facility vaulted at the stars in great kangaroo-leaps of\narch and cantilever span, jeweled in glass and metal as if the entire\nport were a mechanism for navigating interplanetary space. Rufus\nSollenar paced its esplanades, measuring his steps, holding his arms\nstill, for the short time until he could board the Mars rocket.\n\nErect and majestic, he took a place in the lounge and carefully sipped\nliqueur, once the liner had boosted away from Earth and coupled in its\nFaraday main drives.\n\nMr. Ermine settled into the place beside him.\n\nSollenar looked over at him calmly. \"I thought so.\"\n\nErmine nodded. \"Of course you did. But I didn't almost miss you. I\nwas here ahead of you. I have no objection to your going to Mars, Mr.\nSollenar. _Laissez faire._ Provided I can go along.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Rufus Sollenar said. \"Liqueur?\" He gestured with his glass.\n\nErmine shook his head. \"No, thank you,\" he said delicately.\n\nSollenar said: \"Even your tongue?\"\n\n\"Of course my tongue, Mr. Sollenar. I taste nothing. I touch nothing.\"\nErmine smiled. \"But I feel no pressure.\"\n\n\"All right, then,\" Rufus Sollenar said crisply. \"We have several hours\nto landing time. You sit and dream your interior dreams, and I'll dream\nmine.\" He faced around in his chair and folded his arms across his\nchest.\n\n\"Mr. Sollenar,\" Ermine said gently.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I am once again with you by appointment as provided under the By-Laws.\"\n\n\"State your business, Mr. Ermine.\"\n\n\"You are not permitted to lie in an unknown grave, Mr. Sollenar.\nInsurance policies on your life have been taken out at a high premium\nrate. The IAB members concerned cannot wait the statutory seven years\nto have you declared dead. Do what you will, Mr. Sollenar, but I must\ntake care I witness your death. From now on, I am with you wherever you\ngo.\"\n\nSollenar smiled. \"I don't intend to die. Why should I die, Mr. Ermine?\"\n\n\"I have no idea, Mr. Sollenar. But I know Cortwright Burr's character.\nAnd isn't that he, seated there in the corner? The light is poor, but\nI think he's recognizable.\"\n\nAcross the lounge, Burr raised his head and looked into Sollenar's\neyes. He raised a hand near his face, perhaps merely to signify\ngreeting. Rufus Sollenar faced front.\n\n\"A worthy opponent, Mr. Sollenar,\" Ermine said. \"A persevering,\nunforgiving, ingenious man. And yet--\" Ermine seemed a little touched\nby bafflement. \"And yet it seems to me, Mr. Sollenar, that he got you\nrunning rather easily. What _did_ happen between you, after my advisory\ncall?\"\n\nSollenar turned a terrible smile on Ermine. \"I shot him to pieces. If\nyou'd peel his face, you'd see.\"\n\nErmine sighed. \"Up to this moment, I had thought perhaps you might\nstill salvage your affairs.\"\n\n\"Pity, Mr. Ermine? Pity for the insane?\"\n\n\"Interest. I can take no part in your world. Be grateful, Mr. Sollenar.\nI am not the same gullible man I was when I signed my contract with\nIAB, so many years ago.\"\n\nSollenar laughed. Then he stole a glance at Burr's corner.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe ship came down at Abernathy Field, in Aresia, the Terrestrial\ncity. Industrialized, prefabricated, jerry-built and clamorous, the\nstorm-proofed buildings huddled, but huddled proudly, at the desert's\nedge.\n\nLow on the horizon was the Martian settlement--the buildings so\nskillfully blended with the landscape, so eroded, so much abandoned\nthat the uninformed eye saw nothing. Sollenar had been to Mars--on\na tour. He had seen the natives in their nameless dwelling place;\narrogant, venomous and weak. He had been told, by the paid guide, they\ntrafficked with Earthmen as much as they cared to, and kept to their\nplace on the rim of Earth's encroachment, observing.\n\n\"Tell me, Ermine,\" Sollenar said quietly as they walked across the\nterminal lobby. \"You're to kill me, aren't you, if I try to go on\nwithout you?\"\n\n\"A matter of procedure, Mr. Sollenar,\" Ermine said evenly. \"We cannot\nrisk the investment capital of so many IAB members.\"\n\nSollenar sighed. \"If I were any other member, how I would commend you,\nMr. Ermine! Can we hire a car for ourselves, then, somewhere nearby?\"\n\n\"Going out to see the engineers?\" Ermine asked. \"Who would have thought\nthey'd have something valuable for sale?\"\n\n\"I want to show them something,\" Sollenar said.\n\n\"What thing, Mr. Sollenar?\"\n\nThey turned the corner of a corridor, with branching hallways here and\nthere, not all of them busy. \"Come here,\" Sollenar said, nodding toward\none of them.\n\nThey stopped out of sight of the lobby and the main corridor. \"Come\non,\" Sollenar said. \"A little further.\"\n\n\"No,\" Ermine said. \"This is farther than I really wish. It's dark here.\"\n\n\"Wise too late, Mr. Ermine,\" Sollenar said, his arms flashing out.\n\nOne palm impacted against Ermine's solar plexus, and the other against\nthe muscle at the side of his neck, but not hard enough to kill. Ermine\ncollapsed, starved for oxygen, while Sollenar silently cursed having\nbeen cured of murder. Then Sollenar turned and ran.\n\nBehind him Ermine's body struggled to draw breath by reflex alone.\n\nMoving as fast as he dared, Sollenar walked back and reached the taxi\nlock, pulling a respirator from a wall rack as he went. He flagged a\ncar and gave his destination, looking behind him. He had seen nothing\nof Cortwright Burr since setting foot on Mars. But he knew that soon or\nlate, Burr would find him.\n\nA few moments later Ermine got to his feet. Sollenar's car was well\naway. Ermine shrugged and went to the local broadcasting station.\n\nHe commandeered a private desk, a firearm and immediate time on the IAB\ninteroffice circuit to Earth. When his call acknowledgement had come\nback to him from his office there, he reported:\n\n\"Sollenar is enroute to the Martian city. He wants a duplicate of\nBurr's device, of course, since he smashed the original when he killed\nBurr. I'll follow and make final disposition. The disorientation I\nreported previously is progressing rapidly. Almost all his responses\nnow are inappropriate. On the flight out, he seemed to be staring at\nsomething in an empty seat. Quite often when spoken to he obviously\nhears something else entirely. I expect to catch one of the next few\nflights back.\"\n\nThere was no point in waiting for comment to wend its way back from\nEarth. Ermine left. He went to a cab rank and paid the exorbitant fee\nfor transportation outside Aresian city limits.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nClose at hand, the Martian city was like a welter of broken pots.\nShards of wall and roof joined at savage angles and pointed to\nnothing. Underfoot, drifts of vitreous material, shaped to fit no sane\nconfiguration, and broken to fit such a mosaic as no church would\ncontain, rocked and slid under Sollenar's hurrying feet.\n\nWhat from Aresia had been a solid front of dun color was here a facade\nof red, green and blue splashed about centuries ago and since then\nweathered only enough to show how bitter the colors had once been. The\nplum-colored sky stretched over all this like a frigid membrane, and\nthe wind blew and blew.\n\nHere and there, as he progressed, Sollenar saw Martian arms and heads\nprotruding from the rubble. Sculptures.\n\nHe was moving toward the heart of the city, where some few unbroken\nstructures persisted. At the top of a heap of shards he turned to look\nbehind him. There was the dust-plume of his cab, returning to the\ncity. He expected to walk back--perhaps to meet someone on the road,\nall alone on the Martian plain if only Ermine would forebear from\ninterfering. Searching the flat, thin-aired landscape, he tried to pick\nout the plodding dot of Cortwright Burr. But not yet.\n\nHe turned and ran down the untrustworthy slope.\n\nHe reached the edge of the maintained area. Here the rubble was gone,\nthe ancient walks swept, the statues kept upright on their pediments.\nBut only broken walls suggested the fronts of the houses that had stood\nhere. Knifing their sides up through the wind-rippled sand that only\nconstant care kept off the street, the shadow-houses fenced his way\nand the sculptures were motionless as hope. Ahead of him, he saw the\nbuildings of the engineers. There was no heap to climb and look to see\nif Ermine followed close behind.\n\nSucking his respirator, he reached the building of the Martian\nengineers.\n\nA sounding strip ran down the doorjamb. He scratched his fingernails\nsharply along it, and the magnified vibration, ducted throughout the\nhollow walls, rattled his plea for entrance.\n\n\nV\n\nThe door opened, and Martians stood looking. They were spindly-limbed\nand slight, their faces framed by folds of leathery tissue. Their\nmouths were lipped with horn as hard as dentures, and pursed, forever\nready to masticate. They were pleasant neither to look at nor, Sollenar\nknew, to deal with. But Cortwright Burr had done it. And Sollenar\nneeded to do it.\n\n\"Does anyone here speak English?\" he asked.\n\n\"I,\" said the central Martian, his mouth opening to the sound, closing\nto end the reply.\n\n\"I would like to deal with you.\"\n\n\"Whenever,\" the Martian said, and the group at the doorway parted\ndeliberately to let Sollenar in.\n\nBefore the door closed behind him, Sollenar looked back. But the rubble\nof the abandoned sectors blocked his line of sight into the desert.\n\n\"What can you offer? And what do you want?\" the Martian asked. Sollenar\nstood half-ringed by them, in a room whose corners he could not see in\nthe uncertain light.\n\n\"I offer you Terrestrial currency.\"\n\nThe English-speaking Martian--the Martian who had admitted to speaking\nEnglish--turned his head slightly and spoke to his fellows. There were\nclacking sounds as his lips met. The others reacted variously, one of\nthem suddenly gesturing with what seemed a disgusted flip of his arm\nbefore he turned without further word and stalked away, his shoulders\nlooking like the shawled back of a very old and very hungry woman.\n\n\"What did Burr give you?\" Sollenar asked.\n\n\"Burr.\" The Martian cocked his head. His eyes were not multi-faceted,\nbut gave that impression.\n\n\"He was here and he dealt with you. Not long ago. On what basis?\"\n\n\"Burr. Yes. Burr gave us currency. We will take currency from you. For\nthe same thing we gave him?\"\n\n\"For immortality, yes.\"\n\n\"Im--This is a new word.\"\n\n\"Is it? For the secret of not dying?\"\n\n\"Not dying? You think we have not-dying for sale here?\" The Martian\nspoke to the others again. Their lips clattered. Others left, like the\nfirst one had, moving with great precision and very slow step, and no\nremaining tolerance for Sollenar.\n\nSollenar cried out: \"What did you sell him, then?\"\n\nThe principal engineer said: \"We made an entertainment device for him.\"\n\n\"A little thing. This size.\" Sollenar cupped his hands.\n\n\"You have seen it, then.\"\n\n\"Yes. And nothing more? That was all he bought here?\"\n\n\"It was all we had to sell--or give. We don't yet know whether Earthmen\nwill give us things in exchange for currency. We'll see, when we next\nneed something from Aresia.\"\n\nSollenar demanded: \"How did it work? This thing you sold him.\"\n\n\"Oh, it lets people tell stories to themselves.\"\n\nSollenar looked closely at the Martian. \"What kind of stories?\"\n\n\"Any kind,\" the Martian said blandly. \"Burr told us what he wanted. He\nhad drawings with him of an Earthman device that used pictures on a\nscreen, and broadcast sounds, to carry the details of the story told to\nthe auditor.\"\n\n\"He stole those patents! He couldn't have used them on Earth.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"And why should he? Our device needs to convey no precise details. Any\nmind can make its own. It only needs to be put into a situation, and\nfrom there it can do all the work. If an auditor wishes a story of\ncontact with other sexes, for example, the projector simply makes it\nseem to him, the next time he is with the object of his desire, that he\nis getting positive feedback--that he is arousing a similar response\nin that object. Once that has been established for him, the auditor\nmay then leave the machine, move about normally, conduct his life as\nusual--but always in accordance with the basic situation. It is, you\nsee, in the end a means of introducing system into his view of reality.\nOf course, his society must understand that he is not in accord with\nreality, for some of what he does cannot seem rational from an outside\nview of him. So some care must be taken, but not much. If many such\ndevices were to enter his society, soon the circumstances would become\ncommonplace, and the society would surely readjust to allow for it,\"\nsaid the English-speaking Martian.\n\n\"The machine creates any desired situation in the auditor's mind?\"\n\n\"Certainly. There are simple predisposing tapes that can be inserted as\ndesired. Love, adventure, cerebration--it makes no difference.\"\n\nSeveral of the bystanders clacked sounds out to each other. Sollenar\nlooked at them narrowly. It was obvious there had to be more than one\nEnglish-speaker among these people.\n\n\"And the device you gave Burr,\" he asked the engineer, neither\ncalmly nor hopefully. \"What sort of stories could its auditors tell\nthemselves?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Martian cocked his head again. It gave him the look of an owl at\na bedroom window. \"Oh, there was one situation we were particularly\ninstructed to include. Burr said he was thinking ahead to showing it to\nan acquaintance of his.\n\n\"It was a situation of adventure; of adventure with the fearful. And\nit was to end in loss and bitterness.\" The Martian looked even more\nclosely at Sollenar. \"Of course, the device does not specify details.\nNo one but the auditor can know what fearful thing inhabits his story,\nor precisely how the end of it would come. You would, I believe, be\nRufus Sollenar? Burr spoke of you and made the noise of laughing.\"\n\nSollenar opened his mouth. But there was nothing to say.\n\n\"You want such a device?\" the Martian asked. \"We've prepared several\nsince Burr left. He spoke of machines that would manufacture them in\nastronomical numbers. We, of course, have done our best with our poor\nhands.\"\n\nSollenar said: \"I would like to look out your door.\"\n\n\"Pleasure.\"\n\nSollenar opened the door slightly. Mr. Ermine stood in the cleared\nstreet, motionless as the shadow buildings behind him. He raised one\nhand in a gesture of unfelt greeting as he saw Sollenar, then put it\nback on the stock of his rifle. Sollenar closed the door, and turned to\nthe Martian. \"How much currency do you want?\"\n\n\"Oh, all you have with you. You people always have a good deal with you\nwhen you travel.\"\n\nSollenar plunged his hands into his pockets and pulled out his\nbillfold, his change, his keys, his jeweled radio; whatever was there,\nhe rummaged out onto the floor, listening to the sound of rolling coins.\n\n\"I wish I had more here,\" he laughed. \"I wish I had the amount that man\nout there is going to recover when he shoots me.\"\n\nThe Martian engineer cocked his head. \"But your dream is over, Mr.\nSollenar,\" he clacked drily. \"Isn't it?\"\n\n\"Quite so. But you to your purposes and I to mine. Now give me one of\nthose projectors. And set it to predispose a situation I am about to\nspecify to you. Take however long it needs. The audience is a patient\none.\" He laughed, and tears gathered in his eyes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMr. Ermine waited, isolated from the cold, listening to hear whether\nthe rifle stock was slipping out of his fingers. He had no desire to\ngo into the Martian building after Sollenar and involve third parties.\nAll he wanted was to put Sollenar's body under a dated marker, with as\nlittle trouble as possible.\n\nNow and then he walked a few paces backward and forward, to keep\nfrom losing muscular control at his extremities because of low skin\ntemperature. Sollenar must come out soon enough. He had no food supply\nwith him, and though Ermine did not like the risk of engaging a man\nlike Sollenar in a starvation contest, there was no doubt that a man\nwith no taste for fuel could outlast one with the acquired reflexes of\neating.\n\nThe door opened and Sollenar came out.\n\nHe was carrying something. Perhaps a weapon. Ermine let him come\ncloser while he raised and carefully sighted his rifle. Sollenar might\nhave some Martian weapon or he might not. Ermine did not particularly\ncare. If Ermine died, he would hardly notice it--far less than he would\nnotice a botched ending to a job of work already roiled by Sollenar's\nbreak away at the space field. If Ermine died, some other SPRO agent\nwould be assigned almost immediately. No matter what happened, SPRO\nwould stop Sollenar before he ever reached Abernathy Field.\n\nSo there was plenty of time to aim an unhurried, clean shot.\n\nSollenar was closer, now. He seemed to be in a very agitated frame of\nmind. He held out whatever he had in his hand.\n\nIt was another one of the Martian entertainment machines. Sollenar\nseemed to be offering it as a token to Ermine. Ermine smiled.\n\n\"What can you offer me, Mr. Sollenar?\" he said, and shot.\n\nThe golden ball rolled away over the sand. \"There, now,\" Ermine said.\n\"_Now_, wouldn't you sooner be me than you? And where is the thing that\nmade the difference between us?\"\n\nHe shivered. He was chilly. Sand was blowing against his tender face,\nwhich had been somewhat abraded during his long wait.\n\nHe stopped, transfixed.\n\nHe lifted his head.\n\nThen, with a great swing of his arms, he sent the rifle whirling\naway. \"The wind!\" he sighed into the thin air. \"I feel the wind.\" He\nleapt into the air, and sand flew away from his feet as he landed. He\nwhispered to himself: \"I feel the ground!\"\n\nHe stared in tremblant joy at Sollenar's empty body. \"What have you\ngiven me?\" Full of his own rebirth, he swung his head up at the sky\nagain, and cried in the direction of the Sun: \"Oh, you squeezing,\nnibbling people who made me incorruptible and thought that was the end\nof me!\"\n\nWith love he buried Sollenar, and with reverence he put up the marker,\nbut he had plans for what he might accomplish with the facts of this\ntransaction, and the myriad others he was privy to.\n\nA sharp bit of pottery had penetrated the sole of his shoe and gashed\nhis foot, but he, not having seen it, hadn't felt it. Nor would he\nsee it or feel it even when he changed his stockings; for he had not\nnoticed the wound when it was made. It didn't matter. In a few days it\nwould heal, though not as rapidly as if it had been properly attended\nto.\n\nVaguely, he heard the sound of Martians clacking behind their closed\ndoor as he hurried out of the city, full of revenge, and reverence for\nhis savior.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Wall of Crystal, Eye of Night, by Algis Budrys\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK WALL OF CRYSTAL, EYE OF NIGHT ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51726.txt or 51726.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/7/2/51726/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations.

The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
