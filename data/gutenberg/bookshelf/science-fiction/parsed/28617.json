But there still remained, deep-seated\n    in his century-old mind, the memory of his crime.\n\n[Illustration: _Tom tripped on a wire and fell, with his ferocious\nadversary on top._]\n\n\nTwo miles west of the village of Laketon there lived an aged recluse who\nwas known only as Old Crompton. As far back as the villagers could\nremember he had visited the town regularly twice a month, each time\ntottering his lonely way homeward with a load of provisions. He appeared\nto be well supplied with funds, but purchased sparingly as became a\nmiserly hermit. And so vicious was his tongue that few cared to converse\nwith him, even the young hoodlums of the town hesitating to harass him\nwith the banter usually accorded the other bizarre characters of the\nstreets.\n\nThe oldest inhabitants knew nothing of his past history, and they had\nlong since lost their curiosity in the matter. He was a fixture, as was\nthe old town hall with its surrounding park. His lonely cabin was\nshunned by all who chanced to pass along the old dirt road that led\nthrough the woods to nowhere and was rarely used.\n\nHis only extravagance was in the matter of books, and the village book\nstore profited considerably by his purchases. But, at the instigation of\nCass Harmon, the bookseller, it was whispered about that Old Crompton\nwas a believer in the black art--that he had made a pact with the devil\nhimself and was leagued with him and his imps. For the books he bought\nwere strange ones; ancient volumes that Cass must needs order from New\nYork or Chicago and that cost as much as ten and even fifteen dollars a\ncopy; translations of the writings of the alchemists and astrologers and\nphilosophers of the dark ages.\n\nIt was no wonder Old Crompton was looked at askance by the simple-living\nand deeply religious natives of the small Pennsylvania town.\n\nBut there came a day when the hermit was to have a neighbor, and the\ntown buzzed with excited speculation as to what would happen.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe property across the road from Old Crompton's hut belonged to Alton\nForsythe, Laketon's wealthiest resident--hundreds of acres of scrubby\nwoodland that he considered well nigh worthless. But Tom Forsythe, the\nonly son, had returned from college and his ambitions were of a nature\nstrange to his townspeople and utterly incomprehensible to his father.\nSomething vague about biology and chemical experiments and the like is\nwhat he spoke of, and, when his parents objected on the grounds of\npossible explosions and other weird accidents, he prevailed upon his\nfather to have a secluded laboratory built for him in the woods.\n\nWhen the workmen started the small frame structure not a quarter of a\nmile from his own hut, Old Crompton was furious. He raged and stormed,\nbut to no avail. Tom Forsythe had his heart set on the project and he\nwas somewhat of a successful debater himself. The fire that flashed from\nhis cold gray eyes matched that from the pale blue ones of the elderly\nanchorite. And the law was on his side.\n\nSo the building was completed and Tom Forsythe moved in, bag and\nbaggage.\n\nFor more than a year the hermit studiously avoided his neighbor, though,\ntruth to tell, this required very little effort. For Tom Forsythe became\nalmost as much of a recluse as his predecessor, remaining indoors for\ndays at a time and visiting the home of his people scarcely oftener than\nOld Crompton visited the village. He too became the target of village\ngossip and his name was ere long linked with that of the old man in\nsimilar animadversion. But he cared naught for the opinions of his\ntownspeople nor for the dark looks of suspicion that greeted him on his\nrare appearances in the public places. His chosen work engrossed him so\ndeeply that all else counted for nothing. His parents remonstrated with\nhim in vain. Tom laughed away their recriminations and fears, continuing\nwith his labors more strenuously than ever. He never troubled his mind\nover the nearness of Old Crompton's hut, the existence of which he\nhardly noticed or considered.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt so happened one day that the old man's curiosity got the better of\nhim and Tom caught him prowling about on his property, peering\nwonderingly at the many rabbit hutches, chicken coops, dove cotes and\nthe like which cluttered the space to the rear of the laboratory.\n\nSeeing that he was discovered, the old man wrinkled his face into a\ntoothless grin of conciliation.\n\n\"Just looking over your place, Forsythe,\" he said. \"Sorry about the fuss\nI made when you built the house. But I'm an old man, you know, and\nchanges are unwelcome. Now I have forgotten my objections and would like\nto be friends. Can we?\"\n\nTom peered searchingly into the flinty eyes that were set so deeply in\nthe wrinkled, leathery countenance. He suspected an ulterior motive, but\ncould not find it within him to turn the old fellow down.\n\n\"Why--I guess so, Crompton,\" he hesitated: \"I have nothing against you,\nbut I came here for seclusion and I'll not have anyone bothering me in\nmy work.\"\n\n\"I'll not bother you, young man. But I'm fond of pets and I see you have\nmany of them here; guinea pigs, chickens, pigeons, and rabbits. Would\nyou mind if I make friends with some of them?\"\n\n\"They're not pets,\" answered Tom dryly, \"they are material for use in my\nexperiments. But you may amuse yourself with them if you wish.\"\n\n\"You mean that you cut them up--kill them, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Not that. But I sometimes change them in physical form, sometimes cause\nthem to become of huge size, sometimes produce pigmy offspring of normal\nanimals.\"\n\n\"Don't they suffer?\"\n\n\"Very seldom, though occasionally a subject dies. But the benefit that\nwill accrue to mankind is well worth the slight inconvenience to the\ndumb creatures and the infrequent loss of their lives.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOld Crompton regarded him dubiously. \"You are trying to find?\" he\ninterrogated.\n\n\"The secret of life!\" Tom Forsythe's eyes took on the stare of\nfanaticism. \"Before I have finished I shall know the nature of the vital\nforce--how to produce it. I shall prolong human life indefinitely;\ncreate artificial life. And the solution is more closely approached with\neach passing day.\"\n\nThe hermit blinked in pretended mystification. But he understood\nperfectly, and he bitterly envied the younger man's knowledge and\nability that enabled him to delve into the mysteries of nature which had\nalways been so attractive to his own mind. And somehow, he acquired a\nsudden deep hatred of the coolly confident young man who spoke so\npositively of accomplishing the impossible.\n\nDuring the winter months that followed, the strange acquaintance\nprogressed but little. Tom did not invite his neighbor to visit him,\nnor did Old Crompton go out of his way to impose his presence on the\nyounger man, though each spoke pleasantly enough to the other on the few\noccasions when they happened to meet.\n\nWith the coming of spring they encountered one another more frequently,\nand Tom found considerable of interest in the quaint, borrowed\nphilosophy of the gloomy old man. Old Crompton, of course, was\ndesperately interested in the things that were hidden in Tom's\nlaboratory, but he never requested permission to see them. He hid his\nreal feelings extremely well and was apparently content to spend as much\ntime as possible with the feathered and furred subjects for experiment,\nbeing very careful not to incur Tom's displeasure by displaying too\ngreat interest in the laboratory itself.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen there came a day in early summer when an accident served to draw\nthe two men closer together, and Old Crompton's long-sought opportunity\nfollowed.\n\nHe was starting for the village when, from down the road, there came a\nseries of tremendous squawkings, then a bellow of dismay in the voice of\nhis young neighbor. He turned quickly and was astonished at the sight of\na monstrous rooster which had escaped and was headed straight for him\nwith head down and wings fluttering wildly. Tom followed close behind,\nbut was unable to catch the darting monster. And monster it was, for\nthis rooster stood no less than three feet in height and appeared more\nferocious than a large turkey. Old Crompton had his shopping bag, a\nlarge one of burlap which he always carried to town, and he summoned\nenough courage to throw it over the head of the screeching, over-sized\nfowl. So tangled did the panic-stricken bird become that it was a\ncomparatively simple matter to effect his capture, and the old man rose\nto his feet triumphant with the bag securely closed over the struggling\ncaptive.\n\n\"Thanks,\" panted Tom, when he drew alongside. \"I should never have\ncaught him, and his appearance at large might have caused me a great\ndeal of trouble--now of all times.\"\n\n\"It's all right, Forsythe,\" smirked the old man. \"Glad I was able to do\nit.\"\n\nSecretly he gloated, for he knew this occurrence would be an open sesame\nto that laboratory of Tom's. And it proved to be just that.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA few nights later he was awakened by a vigorous thumping at his door,\nsomething that had never before occurred during his nearly sixty years\noccupancy of the tumbledown hut. The moon was high and he cautiously\npeeped from the window and saw that his late visitor was none other than\nyoung Forsythe.\n\n\"With you in a minute!\" he shouted, hastily thrusting his rheumatic old\nlimbs into his shabby trousers. \"Now to see the inside of that\nlaboratory,\" he chuckled to himself.\n\nIt required but a moment to attire himself in the scanty raiment he wore\nduring the warm months, but he could hear Tom muttering and impatiently\npacing the flagstones before his door.\n\n\"What is it?\" he asked, as he drew the bolt and emerged into the\nbrilliant light of the moon.\n\n\"Success!\" breathed Tom excitedly. \"I have produced growing, living\nmatter synthetically. More than this, I have learned the secret of the\nvital force--the spark of life. Immortality is within easy reach. Come\nand see for yourself.\"\n\nThey quickly traversed the short distance to the two-story building\nwhich comprised Tom's workshop and living quarters. The entire ground\nfloor was taken up by the laboratory, and Old Crompton stared aghast at\nthe wealth of equipment it contained. Furnaces there were, and retorts\nthat reminded him of those pictured in the wood cuts in some of his\nmusty books. Then there were complicated machines with many levers and\ndials mounted on their faces, and with huge glass bulbs of peculiar\nshape with coils of wire connecting to knoblike protuberances of their\ntransparent walls. In the exact center of the great single room there\nwas what appeared to be a dissecting table, with a brilliant light\noverhead and with two of the odd glass bulbs at either end. It was to\nthis table that Tom led the excited old man.\n\n\"This is my perfected apparatus,\" said Tom proudly, \"and by its use I\nintend to create a new race of supermen, men and women who will always\nretain the vigor and strength of their youth and who can not die\nexcepting by actual destruction of their bodies. Under the influence of\nthe rays all bodily ailments vanish as if by magic, and organic defects\nare quickly corrected. Watch this now.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe stepped to one of the many cages at the side of the room and returned\nwith a wriggling cottontail in his hands. Old Compton watched anxiously\nas he picked a nickeled instrument from a tray of surgical appliances\nand requested his visitor to hold the protesting animal while he covered\nits head with a handkerchief.\n\n\"Ethyl chloride,\" explained Tom, noting with amusement the look of\ndistaste on the old man's face. \"We'll just put him to sleep for a\nminute while I amputate a leg.\"\n\nThe struggles of the rabbit quickly ceased when the spray soaked the\nhandkerchief and the anaesthetic took effect. With a shining scalpel and\na surgical saw, Tom speedily removed one of the forelegs of the animal\nand then he placed the limp body in the center of the table, removing\nthe handkerchief from its head as he did so. At the end of the table\nthere was a panel with its glittering array of switches and electrical\ninstruments, and Old Crompton observed very closely the manipulations of\nthe controls as Tom started the mechanism. With the ensuing hum of a\nmotor-generator from a corner of the room, the four bulbs adjacent to\nthe table sprang into life, each glowing with a different color and each\nemitting a different vibratory note as it responded to the energy\nwithin.\n\n\"Keep an eye on Mr. Rabbit now,\" admonished Tom.\n\nFrom the body of the small animal there emanated an intangible though\nhazily visible aura as the combined effects of the rays grew in\nintensity. Old Crompton bent over the table and peered amazedly at the\nstump of the foreleg, from which blood no longer dripped. The stump was\nhealing over! Yes--it seemed to elongate as one watched. A new limb was\ngrowing on to replace the old! Then the animal struggled once more, this\ntime to regain consciousness. In a moment it was fully awake and, with a\nfrightened hop, was off the table and hobbling about in search of a\nhiding place.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTom Forsythe laughed. \"Never knew what happened,\" he exulted, \"and\nexcepting for the temporary limp is not inconvenienced at all. Even that\nwill be gone in a couple of hours, for the new limb will be completely\ngrown by that time.\"\n\n\"But--but, Tom,\" stammered the old man, \"this is wonderful. How do you\naccomplish it?\"\n\n\"Ha! Don't think I'll reveal my secret. But this much I will tell you:\nthe life force generated by my apparatus stimulates a certain gland\nthat's normally inactive in warm blooded animals. This gland, when\nactive, possesses the function of growing new members to the body to\nreplace lost ones in much the same manner as this is done in case of the\nlobster and certain other crustaceans. Of course, the process is\nextremely rapid when the gland is stimulated by the vital rays from my\ntubes. But this is only one of the many wonders of the process. Here is\nsomething far more remarkable.\"\n\nHe took from a large glass jar the body of a guinea pig, a body that was\nrigid in death.\n\n\"This guinea pig,\" he explained, \"was suffocated twenty-four hours ago\nand is stone dead.\"\n\n\"Suffocated?\"\n\n\"Yes. But quite painlessly, I assure you. I merely removed the air from\nthe jar with a vacuum pump and the little creature passed out of the\npicture very quickly. Now we'll revive it.\"\n\nOld Crompton stretched forth a skinny hand to touch the dead animal, but\nwithdrew it hastily when he felt the clammy rigidity of the body. There\nwas no doubt as to the lifelessness of this specimen.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTom placed the dead guinea pig on the spot where the rabbit had been\nsubjected to the action of the rays. Again his visitor watched carefully\nas he manipulated the controls of the apparatus.\n\nWith the glow of the tubes and the ensuing haze of eery light that\nsurrounded the little body, a marked change was apparent. The inanimate\nform relaxed suddenly and it seemed that the muscles pulsated with an\naccession of energy. Then one leg was stretched forth spasmodically.\nThere was a convulsive heave as the lungs drew in a first long breath,\nand, with that, an astonished and very much alive rodent scrambled to\nits feet, blinking wondering eyes in the dazzling light.\n\n\"See? See?\" shouted Tom, grasping Old Crompton by the arm in a viselike\ngrip. \"It is the secret of life and death! Aristocrats, plutocrats and\nbeggars will beat a path to my door. But, never fear, I shall choose my\nsubjects well. The name of Thomas Forsythe will yet be emblazoned in the\nHall of Fame. I shall be master of the world!\"\n\nOld Crompton began to fear the glitter in the eyes of the gaunt young\nman who seemed suddenly to have become demented. And his envy and hatred\nof his talented host blazed anew as Forsythe gloried in the success of\nhis efforts. Then he was struck with an idea and he affected his most\ningratiating manner.\n\n\"It is a marvelous thing, Tom,\" he said, \"and is entirely beyond my poor\ncomprehension. But I can see that it is all you say and more. Tell\nme--can you restore the youth of an aged person by these means?\"\n\n\"Positively!\" Tom did not catch the eager note in the old man's voice.\nRather he took the question as an inquiry into the further marvels of\nhis process. \"Here,\" he continued, enthusiastically, \"I'll prove that to\nyou also. My dog Spot is around the place somewhere. And he is a\ndecrepit old hound, blind, lame and toothless. You've probably seen him\nwith me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe rushed to the stairs and whistled. There was an answering yelp from\nabove and the pad of uncertain paws on the bare wooden steps. A dejected\nold beagle blundered into the room, dragging a crippled hind leg as he\nfawned upon his master, who stretched forth a hand to pat the unsteady\nhead.\n\n\"Guess Spot is old enough for the test,\" laughed Tom, \"and I have been\nmeaning to restore him to his youthful vigor, anyway. No time like the\npresent.\"\n\nHe led his trembling pet to the table of the remarkable tubes and lifted\nhim to its surface. The poor old beast lay trustingly where he was\nplaced, quiet, save for his husky asthmatic breathing.\n\n\"Hold him, Crompton,\" directed Tom as he pulled the starting lever of\nhis apparatus.\n\nAnd Old Crompton watched in fascinated anticipation as the ethereal\nluminosity bathed the dog's body in response to the action of the four\nrays. Somewhat vaguely it came to him that the baggy flesh of his own\nwrinkled hands took on a new firmness and color where they reposed on\nthe animal's back. Young Forsythe grinned triumphantly as Spot's\nbreathing became more regular and the rasp gradually left it. Then the\ndog whined in pleasure and wagged his tail with increasing vigor.\nSuddenly he raised his head, perked his ears in astonishment and looked\nhis master straight in the face with eyes that saw once more. The low\nthroat cry rose to a full and joyous bark. He sprang to his feet from\nunder the restraining hands and jumped to the floor in a lithe-muscled\nleap that carried him half way across the room. He capered about with\nthe abandon of a puppy, making extremely active use of four sound limbs.\n\n\"Why--why, Forsythe,\" stammered the hermit, \"it's absolutely incredible.\nTell me--tell me--what is this remarkable force?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis host laughed gleefully. \"You probably wouldn't understand it anyway,\nbut I'll tell you. It is as simple as the nose on your face. The spark\nof life, the vital force, is merely an extremely complicated electrical\nmanifestation which I have been able to duplicate artificially. This\nspark or force is all that distinguishes living from inanimate matter,\nand in living beings the force gradually decreases in power as the years\npass, causing loss of health and strength. The chemical composition of\nbones and tissue alters, joints become stiff, muscles atrophied, and\nbones brittle. By recharging, as it were, with the vital force, the\ngland action is intensified, youth and strength is renewed. By repeating\nthe process every ten or fifteen years the same degree of vigor can be\nmaintained indefinitely. Mankind will become immortal. That is why I say\nI am to be master of the world.\"\n\nFor the moment Old Crompton forgot his jealous hatred in the enthusiasm\nwith which he was imbued. \"Tom--Tom,\" he pleaded in his excitement, \"use\nme as a subject. Renew my youth. My life has been a sad one and a lonely\none, but I would that I might live it over. I should make of it a far\ndifferent one--something worth while. See, I am ready.\"\n\nHe sat on the edge of the gleaming table and made as if to lie down on\nits gleaming surface. But his young host only stared at him in open\namusement.\n\n\"What? You?\" he sneered, unfeelingly. \"Why, you old fossil! I told you I\nwould choose my subjects carefully. They are to be people of standing\nand wealth, who can contribute to the fame and fortune of one Thomas\nForsythe.\"\n\n\"But Tom, I have money,\" Old Crompton begged. But when he saw the hard\nmirth in the younger man's eyes, his old animosity flamed anew and he\nsprang from his position and shook a skinny forefinger in Tom's face.\n\n\"Don't do that to me, you old fool!\" shouted Tom, \"and get out of here.\nThink I'd waste current on an old cadger like you? I guess not! Now get\nout. Get out, I say!\"\n\nThen the old anchorite saw red. Something seemed to snap in his soured\nold brain. He found himself kicking and biting and punching at his host,\nwho backed away from the furious onslaught in surprise. Then Tom tripped\nover a wire and fell to the floor with a force that rattled the windows,\nhis ferocious little adversary on top. The younger man lay still where\nhe had fallen, a trickle of blood showing at his temple.\n\n\"My God! I've killed him!\" gasped the old man.\n\nWith trembling fingers he opened Tom's shirt and listened for his\nheartbeats. Panic-stricken, he rubbed the young man's wrists, slapped\nhis cheeks, and ran for water to dash in his face. But all efforts to\nrevive him proved futile, and then, in awful fear, Old Crompton dashed\ninto the night, the dog Spot snapping at his heels as he ran.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHours later the stooped figure of a shabby old man might have been seen\nstealthily re-entering the lonely workshop where the lights still burned\nbrightly. Tom Forsythe lay rigid in the position in which Old Crompton\nhad left him, and the dog growled menacingly.\n\nAverting his gaze and circling wide of the body, Old Crompton made for\nthe table of the marvelous rays. In minute detail he recalled every move\nmade by Tom in starting and adjusting the apparatus to produce the\nincredible results he had witnessed. Not a moment was to be wasted now.\nAlready he had hesitated too long, for soon would come the dawn and\npossible discovery of his crime. But the invention of his victim would\nsave him from the long arm of the law, for, with youth restored, Old\nCrompton would cease to exist and a new life would open its doors to the\nstarved soul of the hermit. Hermit, indeed! He would begin life anew, an\nactive man with youthful vigor and ambition. Under an assumed name he\nwould travel abroad, would enjoy life, and would later become a\nsuccessful man of affairs. He had enough money, he told himself. And the\npolice would never find Old Crompton, the murderer of Tom Forsythe! He\ndeposited his small traveling bag on the floor and fingered the controls\nof Tom's apparatus.\n\nHe threw the starting switch confidently and grinned in satisfaction as\nthe answering whine of the motor-generator came to his ears. One by one\nhe carefully made the adjustments in exactly the manner followed by the\nnow silenced discoverer of the process. Everything operated precisely as\nit had during the preceding experiments. Odd that he should have\nanticipated some such necessity! But something had told him to observe\nTom's movements carefully, and now he rejoiced in the fact that his\nintuition had led him aright. Painfully he climbed to the table top and\nstretched his aching body in the warm light of the four huge tubes. His\nexertions during the struggle with Tom were beginning to tell on him.\nBut the soreness and stiffness of feeble muscles and stubborn joints\nwould soon be but a memory. His pulses quickened at the thought and he\nbreathed deep in a sudden feeling of unaccustomed well-being.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe dog growled continuously from his position at the head of his\nmaster, but did not move to interfere with the intruder. And Old\nCrompton, in the excitement of the momentous experience, paid him not\nthe slightest attention.\n\nHis body tingled from head to foot with a not unpleasant sensation that\nconveyed the assurance of radical changes taking place under the\ninfluence of the vital rays. The tingling sensation increased in\nintensity until it seemed that every corpuscle in his veins danced to\nthe tune of the vibration from those glowing tubes that bathed him in an\never-spreading radiance. Aches and pains vanished from his body, but he\nsoon experienced a sharp stab of new pain in his lower jaw. With an\nexperimental forefinger he rubbed the gum. He laughed aloud as the\nrealization came to him that in those gums where there had been no teeth\nfor more than twenty years there was now growing a complete new set. And\nthe rapidity of the process amazed him beyond measure. The aching area\nspread quickly and was becoming really uncomfortable. But then--and he\nconsoled himself with the thought--nothing is brought into being without\na certain amount of pain. Besides, he was confident that his discomfort\nwould soon be over.\n\nHe examined his hand, and found that the joints of two fingers long\ncrippled with rheumatism now moved freely and painlessly. The misty\nbrilliance surrounding his body was paling and he saw that the flesh was\ntaking on a faint green fluorescence instead. The rays had completed\ntheir work and soon the transformation would be fully effected. He\nturned on his side and slipped to the floor with the agility of a\nyoungster. The dog snarled anew, but kept steadfastly to his position.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a small mirror over the wash stand at the far end of the room\nand Old Crompton made haste to obtain the first view of his reflected\nimage. His step was firm and springy, his bearing confident, and he\nfound that his long-stooped shoulders straightened naturally and easily.\nHe felt that he had taken on at least two inches in stature, which was\nindeed the case. When he reached the mirror he peered anxiously into its\ndingy surface and what he saw there so startled him that he stepped\nbackward in amazement. This was not Larry Crompton, but an entirely new\nman. The straggly white hair had given way to soft, healthy waves of\nchestnut hue. Gone were the seams from the leathery countenance and the\neyes looked out clearly and steadily from under brows as thick and dark\nas they had been in his youth. The reflected features were those of an\nentire stranger. They were not even reminiscent of the Larry Crompton of\nfifty years ago, but were the features of a far more vigorous and\nprepossessing individual than he had ever seemed, even in the best years\nof his life. The jaw was firm, the once sunken cheeks so well filled out\nthat his high cheek bones were no longer in evidence. It was the face of\na man of not more than thirty-eight years of age, reflecting exceptional\nintelligence and strength of character.\n\n\"What a disguise!\" he exclaimed in delight. And his voice, echoing in\nthe stillness that followed the switching off of the apparatus, was\ndeep-throated and mellow--the voice of a new man.\n\nNow, serenely confident that discovery was impossible, he picked up his\nsmall but heavy bag and started for the door. Dawn was breaking and he\nwished to put as many miles between himself and Tom's laboratory as\ncould be covered in the next few hours. But at the door he hesitated.\nThen, despite the furious yapping of Spot, he returned to the table of\nthe rays and, with deliberate thoroughness smashed the costly tubes\nwhich had brought about his rehabilitation. With a pinch bar from a\nnearby tool rack, he wrecked the controls and generating mechanisms\nbeyond recognition. Now he was absolutely secure! No meddling experts\ncould possibly discover the secret of Tom's invention. All evidence\nwould show that the young experimenter had met his death at the hands of\nOld Crompton, the despised hermit of West Laketon. But none would dream\nthat the handsome man of means who was henceforth to be known as George\nVoight was that same despised hermit.\n\nHe recovered his satchel and left the scene. With long, rapid strides he\nproceeded down the old dirt road toward the main highway where, instead\nof turning east into the village, he would turn west and walk to\nKernsburg, the neighboring town. There, in not more than two hours time,\nhis new life would really begin!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHad you, a visitor, departed from Laketon when Old Crompton did and\nreturned twelve years later, you would have noticed very little\ndifference in the appearance of the village. The old town hall and the\nlittle park were the same, the dingy brick building among the trees\nbeing just a little dingier and its wooden steps more worn and sagged.\nThe main street showed evidence of recent repaving, and, in consequence\nof the resulting increase in through automobile traffic; there were two\nnew gasoline filling stations in the heart of the town. Down the road\nabout a half mile there was a new building, which, upon inquiring from\none of the natives, would be proudly designated as the new high school\nbuilding. Otherwise there were no changes to be observed.\n\nIn his dilapidated chair in the untidy office he had occupied for nearly\nthirty years, sat Asa Culkin, popularly known as \"Judge\" Culkin. Justice\nof the peace, sheriff, attorney-at-law, and three times Mayor of\nLaketon, he was still a controlling factor in local politics and\ngovernment. And many a knotty legal problem was settled in that gloomy\nlittle office. Many a dispute in the town council was dependent for\narbitration upon the keen mind and understanding wit of the old judge.\n\nThe four o'clock train had just puffed its labored way from the station\nwhen a stranger entered his office, a stranger of uncommonly prosperous\nair. The keen blue eyes of the old attorney appraised him instantly and\nclassified him as a successful man of business, not yet forty years of\nage, and with a weighty problem on his mind.\n\n\"What can I do for you, sir?\" he asked, removing his feet from the\nbattered desk top.\n\n\"You may be able to help me a great deal, Judge,\" was the unexpected\nreply. \"I came to Laketon to give myself up.\"\n\n\"Give yourself up?\" Culkin rose to his feet in surprise and\nunconsciously straightened his shoulders in the effort to seem less\ndwarfed before the tall stranger. \"Why, what do you mean?\" he inquired.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I wish to give myself up for murder,\" answered the amazing visitor,\nslowly and with decision, \"for a murder committed twelve years ago. I\nshould like you to listen to my story first, though. It has been kept\ntoo long.\"\n\n\"But I still do not understand.\" There was puzzlement in the honest old\nface of the attorney. He shook his gray locks in uncertainty. \"Why\nshould you come here? Why come to me? What possible interest can I have\nin the matter?\"\n\n\"Just this, Judge. You do not recognize me now, and you will probably\nconsider my story incredible when you hear it. But, when I have given\nyou all the evidence, you will know who I am and will be compelled to\nbelieve. The murder was committed in Laketon. That is why I came to\nyou.\"\n\n\"A murder in Laketon? Twelve years ago?\" Again the aged attorney shook\nhis head. \"But--proceed.\"\n\n\"Yes. I killed Thomas Forsythe.\"\n\nThe stranger looked for an expression of horror in the features of his\nlistener, but there was none. Instead the benign countenance took on a\nlook of deepening amazement, but the smile wrinkles had somehow vanished\nand the old face was grave in its surprised interest.\n\n\"You seem astonished,\" continued the stranger. \"Undoubtedly you were\nconvinced that the murderer was Larry Crompton--Old Crompton, the\nhermit. He disappeared the night of the crime and has never been heard\nfrom since. Am I correct?\"\n\n\"Yes. He disappeared all right. But continue.\"\n\nNot by a lift of his eyebrow did Culkin betray his disbelief, but the\nstranger sensed that his story was somehow not as startling as it should\nhave been.\n\n\"You will think me crazy, I presume. But I am Old Crompton. It was my\nhand that felled the unfortunate young man in his laboratory out there\nin West Laketon twelve years ago to-night. It was his marvelous\ninvention that transformed the old hermit into the apparently young man\nyou see before you. But I swear that I am none other than Larry Crompton\nand that I killed young Forsythe. I am ready to pay the penalty. I can\nbear the flagellation of my own conscience no longer.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe visitor's voice had risen to the point of hysteria. But his listener\nremained calm and unmoved.\n\n\"Now just let me get this straight,\" he said quietly. \"Do I understand\nthat you claim to be Old Crompton, rejuvenated in some mysterious\nmanner, and that you killed Tom Forsythe on that night twelve years ago?\nDo I understand that you wish now to go to trial for that crime and to\npay the penalty?\"\n\n\"Yes! Yes! And the sooner the better. I can stand it no longer. I am the\nmost miserable man in the world!\"\n\n\"Hm-m--hm-m,\" muttered the judge, \"this is strange.\" He spoke soothingly\nto his visitor. \"Do not upset yourself, I beg of you. I will take care\nof this thing for you, never fear. Just take a seat, Mister--er--\"\n\n\"You may call me Voight for the present,\" said the stranger, in a more\ncomposed tone of voice, \"George Voight. That is the name I have been\nusing since the mur--since that fatal night.\"\n\n\"Very well, Mr. Voight,\" replied the counsellor with an air of the\ngreatest solicitude, \"please have a seat now, while I make a telephone\ncall.\"\n\nAnd George Voight slipped into a stiff-backed chair with a sigh of\nrelief. For he knew the judge from the old days and he was now certain\nthat his case would be disposed of very quickly.\n\nWith the telephone receiver pressed to his ear, Culkin repeated a\nnumber. The stranger listened intently during the ensuing silence. Then\nthere came a muffled \"hello\" sounding in impatient response to the call.\n\n\"Hello, Alton,\" spoke the attorney, \"this is Asa speaking. A stranger\nhas just stepped into my office and he claims to be Old Crompton.\nRemember the hermit across the road from your son's old laboratory?\nWell, this man, who bears no resemblance whatever to the old man he\nclaims to be and who seems to be less than half the age of Tom's old\nneighbor, says that he killed Tom on that night we remember so well.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were some surprised remarks from the other end of the wire, but\nVoight was unable to catch them. He was in a cold perspiration at the\nthought of meeting his victim's father.\n\n\"Why, yes, Alton,\" continued Culkin, \"I think there is something in this\nstory, although I cannot believe it all. But I wish you would accompany\nus and visit the laboratory. Will you?\"\n\n\"Lord, man, not that!\" interrupted the judge's visitor. \"I can hardly\nbear to visit the scene of my crime--and in the company of Alton\nForsythe. Please, not that!\"\n\n\"Now you just let me take care of this, young man,\" replied the judge,\ntestily. Then, once more speaking into the mouthpiece of the telephone,\n\"All right, Alton. We'll pick you up at your office in five minutes.\"\n\nHe replaced the receiver on its hook and turned again to his visitor.\n\"Please be so kind as to do exactly as I request,\" he said. \"I want to\nhelp you, but there is more to this thing than you know and I want you\nto follow unquestioningly where I lead and ask no questions at all for\nthe present. Things may turn out differently than you expect.\"\n\n\"All right, Judge.\" The visitor resigned himself to whatever might\ntranspire under the guidance of the man he had called upon to turn him\nover to the officers of the law.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSeated in the judge's ancient motor car, they stopped at the office of\nAlton Forsythe a few minutes later and were joined by that red-faced and\npompous old man. Few words were spoken during the short run to the\nwell-remembered location of Tom's laboratory, and the man who was known\nas George Voight caught at his own throat with nervous fingers when they\npassed the tumbledown remains of the hut in which Old Crompton had spent\nso many years. With a screeching of well-worn brakes the car stopped\nbefore the laboratory, which was now almost hidden behind a mass of\nshrubs and flowers.\n\n\"Easy now, young man,\" cautioned the judge, noting the look of fear\nwhich had clouded his new client's features. The three men advanced to\nthe door through which Old Crompton had fled on that night of horror,\ntwelve years before. The elder Forsythe spoke not a word as he turned\nthe knob and stepped within. Voight shrank from entering, but soon\nmastered his feelings and followed the other two. The sight that met his\neyes caused him to cry aloud in awe.\n\nAt the dissecting table, which seemed to be exactly as he had seen it\nlast but with replicas of the tubes he had destroyed once more in place,\nstood Tom Forsythe! Considerably older and with hair prematurely gray,\nhe was still the young man Old Crompton thought he had killed. Tom\nForsythe was not dead after all! And all of his years of misery had gone\nfor nothing. He advanced slowly to the side of the wondering young man,\nAlton Forsythe and Asa Culkin watching silently from just inside the\ndoor.\n\n\"Tom--Tom,\" spoke the stranger, \"you are alive? You were not dead when I\nleft you on that terrible night when I smashed your precious tubes?\nOh--it is too good to be true! I can scarcely believe my eyes!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe stretched forth trembling fingers to touch the body of the young man\nto assure himself that it was not all a dream.\n\n\"Why,\" said Tom Forsythe, in astonishment. \"I do not know you, sir.\nNever saw you in my life. What do you mean by your talk of smashing my\ntubes, of leaving me for dead?\"\n\n\"Mean?\" The stranger's voice rose now; he was growing excited. \"Why,\nTom, I am Old Crompton. Remember the struggle, here in this very room?\nYou refused to rejuvenate an unhappy old man with your marvelous\napparatus, a temporarily insane old man--Crompton. I was that old man\nand I fought with you. You fell, striking your head. There was blood.\nYou were unconscious. Yes, for many hours I was sure you were dead and\nthat I had murdered you. But I had watched your manipulations of the\napparatus and I subjected myself to the action of the rays. My youth was\nmiraculously restored. I became as you see me now. Detection was\nimpossible, for I looked no more like Old Crompton than you do. I\nsmashed your machinery to avoid suspicion. Then I escaped. And, for\ntwelve years, I have thought myself a murderer. I have suffered the\ntortures of the damned!\"\n\nTom Forsythe advanced on this remarkable visitor with clenched fists.\nStaring him in the eyes with cold appraisal, his wrath was all too\napparent. The dog Spot, young as ever, entered the room and, upon\nobserving the stranger, set up an ominous growling and snarling. At\nleast the dog recognized him!\n\n\"What are you trying to do, catechise me? Are you another of these\nalienists my father has been bringing around?\" The young inventor was\nfurious. \"If you are,\" he continued, \"you can get out of here--now! I'll\nhave no more of this meddling with my affairs. I'm as sane as any of you\nand I refuse to submit to this continual persecution.\"\n\nThe elder Forsythe grunted, and Culkin laid a restraining hand on his\narm. \"Just a minute now, Tom,\" he said soothingly. \"This stranger is no\nalienist. He has a story to tell. Please permit him to finish.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSomewhat mollified, Tom Forsythe shrugged his assent.\n\n\"Tom,\" continued the stranger, more calmly now, \"what I have said is the\ntruth. I shall prove it to you. I'll tell you things no mortals on earth\ncould know but we two. Remember the day I captured the big rooster for\nyou--the monster you had created? Remember the night you awakened me and\nbrought me here in the moonlight? Remember the rabbit whose leg you\namputated and re-grew? The poor guinea pig you had suffocated and whose\nlife you restored? Spot here? Don't you remember rejuvenating him? I was\nhere. And you refused to use your process on me, old man that I was.\nThen is when I went mad and attacked you. Do you believe me, Tom?\"\n\nThen a strange thing happened. While Tom Forsythe gazed in growing\nbelief, the stranger's shoulders sagged and he trembled as with the\nague. The two older men who had kept in the background gasped their\nastonishment as his hair faded to a sickly gray, then became as white as\nthe driven snow. Old Crompton was reverting to his previous state!\nWithin five minutes, instead of the handsome young stranger, there\nstood before them a bent, withered old man--Old Crompton beyond a doubt.\nThe effects of Tom's process were spent.\n\n\"Well I'm damned!\" ejaculated Alton Forsythe. \"You have been right all\nalong, Asa. And I am mighty glad I did not commit Tom as I intended. He\nhas told us the truth all these years and we were not wise enough to see\nit.\"\n\n\"We!\" exclaimed the judge. \"You, Alton Forsythe! I have always upheld\nhim. You have done your son a grave injustice and you owe him your\napologies if ever a father owed his son anything.\"\n\n\"You are right, Asa.\" And, his aristocratic pride forgotten, Alton\nForsythe rushed to the side of his son and embraced him.\n\nThe judge turned to Old Crompton pityingly. \"Rather a bad ending for\nyou, Crompton,\" he said. \"Still, it is better by far than being branded\nas a murderer.\"\n\n\"Better? Better?\" croaked Old Crompton. \"It is wonderful, Judge. I have\nnever been so happy in my life!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe face of the old man beamed, though scalding tears coursed down the\nwithered and seamed cheeks. The two Forsythes looked up from their\ndemonstrations of peacemaking to listen to the amazing words of the old\nhermit.\n\n\"Yes, happy for the first time in my life,\" he continued. \"I am one\nhundred years of age, gentlemen, and I now look it and feel it. That is\nas it should be. And my experience has taught me a final lasting lesson.\nNone of you know it, but, when I was but a very young man I was bitterly\ndisappointed in love. Ha! ha! Never think it to look at me now, would\nyou? But I was, and it ruined my entire life. I had a little\nmoney--inherited--and I traveled about in the world for a few years,\nthen settled in that old hut across the road where I buried myself for\nsixty years, becoming crabbed and sour and despicable. Young Tom here\nwas the first bright spot and, though I admired him, I hated him for\nhis opportunities, hated him for that which he had that I had not. With\nthe promise of his invention I thought I saw happiness, a new life for\nmyself. I got what I wanted, though not in the way I had expected. And I\nwant to tell you gentlemen that there is nothing in it. With\ndevelopments of modern science you may be able to restore a man's\nyouthful vigor of body, but you can't cure his mind with electricity.\nThough I had a youthful body, my brain was the brain of an old\nman--memories were there which could not be suppressed. Even had I not\nhad the fancied death of young Tom on my conscience I should still have\nbeen miserable. I worked. God, how I worked--to forget! But I could not\nforget. I was successful in business and made a lot of money. I am more\nindependent--probably wealthier than you, Alton Forsythe, but that did\nnot bring happiness. I longed to be myself once more, to have the aches\nand pains which had been taken from me. It is natural to age and to die.\nImmortality would make of us a people of restless misery. We would\nquarrel and bicker and long for death, which would not come to relieve\nus. Now it is over for me and I am glad--glad--glad!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe paused for breath, looking beseechingly at Tom Forsythe. \"Tom,\" he\nsaid, \"I suppose you have nothing for me in your heart but hatred. And I\ndon't blame you. But I wish--I wish you would try and forgive me. Can\nyou?\"\n\nThe years had brought increased understanding and tolerance to young\nTom. He stared at Old Crompton and the long-nursed anger over the\ndestruction of his equipment melted into a strange mixture of pity and\nadmiration for the courageous old fellow.\n\n\"Why, I guess I can, Crompton,\" he replied. \"There was many a day when I\nstruggled hopelessly to reconstruct my apparatus, cursing you with every\nbit of energy in my make-up. I could cheerfully have throttled you, had\nyou been within reach. For twelve years I have labored incessantly to\nreproduce the results we obtained on the night of which you speak.\nPeople called me insane--even my father wished to have me committed to\nan asylum. And, until now, I have been unsuccessful. Only to-day has it\nseemed for the first time that the experiments will again succeed. But\nmy ideas have changed with regard to the uses of the process. I was a\ncocksure young pup in the old days, with foolish dreams of fame and\ninfluence. But I have seen the error of my ways. Your experience, too,\nconvinces me that immortality may not be as desirable as I thought. But\nthere are great possibilities in the way of relieving the sufferings of\nmankind and in making this a better world in which to live. With your\nadvice and help I believe I can do great things. I now forgive you\nfreely and I ask you to remain here with me to assist in the work that\nis to come. What do you say to the idea?\"\n\nAt the reverent thankfulness in the pale eyes of the broken old man who\nhad so recently been a perfect specimen of vigorous youth, Alton\nForsythe blew his nose noisily. The little judge smiled benevolently and\nshook his head as if to say, \"I told you so.\" Tom and Old Crompton\ngripped hands--mightily.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n  _COMING, NEXT MONTH_\n  BRIGANDS OF THE MOON\n  By RAY CUMMINGS\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nSpawn of the Stars\n\n_By Charles Willard Diffin_\n\n\n    The Earth lay powerless beneath those loathsome, yellowish\n    monsters that, sheathed in cometlike globes, sprang from the\n    skies to annihilate man and reduce his cities to ashes.\n\n[Illustration: _The sky was alive with winged shapes, and high in the\nair shone the glittering menace, trailing five plumes of gas._]\n\n\nWhen Cyrus R. Thurston bought himself a single-motored Stoughton job he\nwas looking for new thrills. Flying around the east coast had lost its\nzest: he wanted to join that jaunty group who spoke so easily of hopping\noff for Los Angeles.\n\nAnd what Cyrus Thurston wanted he usually obtained. But if that young\nmillionaire-sportsman had been told that on his first flight this\nblocky, bulletlike ship was to pitch him headlong into the exact center\nof the wildest, strangest war this earth had ever seen--well, it is\nstill probable that the Stoughton company would not have lost the sale.\n\nThey were roaring through the starlit, calm night, three thousand feet\nabove a sage sprinkled desert, when the trip ended. Slim Riley had the\nstick when the first blast of hot oil ripped slashingly across the\npilot's window. \"There goes your old trip!\" he yelled. \"Why don't they\ntry putting engines in these ships?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHe jammed over the throttle and, with motor idling, swept down toward\nthe endless miles of moonlit waste. Wind? They had been boring into it.\nThrough the opened window he spotted a likely stretch of ground. Setting\ndown the ship on a nice piece of Arizona desert was a mere detail for\nSlim.\n\n\"Let off a flare,\" he ordered, \"when I give the word.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe white glare of it faded the stars as he sideslipped, then\nstraightened out on his hand-picked field. The plane rolled down a clear\nspace and stopped. The bright glare persisted while he stared curiously\nfrom the quiet cabin. Cutting the motor he opened both windows, then\ngrabbed Thurston by the shoulder.\n\n\"'Tis a curious thing, that,\" he said unsteadily. His hand pointed\nstraight ahead. The flare died, but the bright stars of the desert\ncountry still shone on a glistening, shining bulb.\n\nIt was some two hundred feet away. The lower part was lost in shadow,\nbut its upper surfaces shone rounded and silvery like a giant bubble. It\ntowered in the air, scores of feet above the chaparral beside it. There\nwas a round spot of black on its side, which looked absurdly like a\ndoor....\n\n\"I saw something moving,\" said Thurston slowly. \"On the ground I saw....\nOh, good Lord, Slim, it isn't real!\"\n\nSlim Riley made no reply. His eyes were riveted to an undulating,\nghastly something that oozed and crawled in the pale light not far from\nthe bulb. His hand was reaching, reaching.... It found what he sought;\nhe leaned toward the window. In his hand was the Very pistol for\ndischarging the flares. He aimed forward and up.\n\nThe second flare hung close before it settled on the sandy floor. Its\nblinding whiteness made the more loathsome the sickening yellow of the\nflabby flowing thing that writhed frantically in the glare. It was\nformless, shapeless, a heaving mound of nauseous matter. Yet even in its\nagonized writhing distortions they sensed the beating pulsations that\nmarked it a living thing.\n\nThere were unending ripplings crossing and recrossing through the\nconvolutions. To Thurston there was suddenly a sickening likeness: the\nthing was a brain from a gigantic skull--it was naked--was\nsuffering....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe thing poured itself across the sand. Before the staring gaze of the\nspeechless men an excrescence appeared--a thick bulb on the mass--that\nprotruded itself into a tentacle. At the end there grew instantly a\nhooked hand. It reached for the black opening in the great shell, found\nit, and the whole loathsome shapelessness poured itself up and through\nthe hole.\n\nOnly at the last was it still. In the dark opening the last slippery\nmass held quiet for endless seconds. It formed, as they watched, to a\nhead--frightful--menacing. Eyes appeared in the head; eyes flat and\nround and black save for a cross slit in each; eyes that stared horribly\nand unchangingly into theirs. Below them a gaping mouth opened and\nclosed.... The head melted--was gone....\n\nAnd with its going came a rushing roar of sound.\n\nFrom under the metallic mass shrieked a vaporous cloud. It drove at\nthem, a swirling blast of snow and sand. Some buried memory of gas\nattacks woke Riley from his stupor. He slammed shut the windows\nan instant before the cloud struck, but not before they had seen,\nin the moonlight, a gleaming, gigantic, elongated bulb rise\nswiftly--screamingly--into the upper air.\n\nThe blast tore at their plane. And the cold in their tight compartment\nwas like the cold of outer space. The men stared, speechless, panting.\nTheir breath froze in that frigid room into steam clouds.\n\n\"It--it....\" Thurston gasped--and slumped helpless upon the floor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was an hour before they dared open the door of their cabin. An hour\nof biting, numbing cold. Zero--on a warm summer night on the desert!\nSnow in the hurricane that had struck them!\n\n\"'Twas the blast from the thing,\" guessed the pilot; \"though never did\nI see an engine with an exhaust like that.\" He was pounding himself with\nhis arms to force up the chilled circulation.\n\n\"But the beast--the--the _thing_!\" exclaimed Thurston. \"It's monstrous;\nindecent! It thought--no question of that--but no body! Horrible! Just a\nraw, naked, thinking protoplasm!\"\n\nIt was here that he flung open the door. They sniffed cautiously of the\nair. It was warm again--clean--save for a hint of some nauseous odor.\nThey walked forward; Riley carried a flash.\n\nThe odor grew to a stench as they came where the great mass had lain. On\nthe ground was a fleshy mound. There were bones showing, and horns on a\nskull. Riley held the light close to show the body of a steer. A body of\nraw bleeding meat. Half of it had been absorbed....\n\n\"The damned thing,\" said Riley, and paused vainly for adequate words.\n\"The damned thing was eating.... Like a jelly-fish, it was!\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" Thurston agreed. He pointed about. There were other heaps\nscattered among the low sage.\n\n\"Smothered,\" guessed Thurston, \"with that frozen exhaust. Then the\nfilthy thing landed and came out to eat.\"\n\n\"Hold the light for me,\" the pilot commanded. \"I'm goin' to fix that\nbusted oil line. And I'm goin' to do it right now. Maybe the creature's\nstill hungry.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey sat in their room. About them was the luxury of a modern hotel.\nCyrus Thurston stared vacantly at the breakfast he was forgetting to\neat. He wiped his hands mechanically on a snowy napkin. He looked from\nthe window. There were palm trees in the park, and autos in a ceaseless\nstream. And people! Sane, sober people, living in a sane world. Newsboys\nwere shouting; the life of the city was flowing.\n\n\"Riley!\" Thurston turned to the man across the table. His voice was\ncuriously toneless, and his face haggard. \"Riley, I haven't slept for\nthree nights. Neither have you. We've got to get this thing straight. We\ndidn't both become absolute maniacs at the same instant, but--it was\n_not_ there, it was _never_ there--not _that_....\" He was lost in\nunpleasant recollections. \"There are other records of hallucinations.\"\n\n\"Hallucinations--hell!\" said Slim Riley. He was looking at a Los Angeles\nnewspaper. He passed one hand wearily across his eyes, but his face was\nhappier than it had been in days.\n\n\"We didn't imagine it, we aren't crazy--it's real! Would you read that\nnow!\" He passed the paper across to Thurston. The headlines were\nstartling.\n\n\"Pilot Killed by Mysterious Airship. Silvery Bubble Hangs Over New York.\nDowns Army Plane in Burst of Flame. Vanishes at Terrific Speed.\"\n\n\"It's our little friend,\" said Thurston. And on his face, too, the lines\nwere vanishing; to find this horror a reality was positive relief.\n\"Here's the same cloud of vapor--drifted slowly across the city,\nthe accounts says, blowing this stuff like steam from underneath.\nAirplanes investigated--an army plane drove into the vapor--terrific\nexplosion--plane down in flames--others wrecked. The machine ascended\nwith meteor speed, trailing blue flame. Come on, boy, where's that old\nbus? Thought I never wanted to fly a plane again. Now I don't want to do\nanything but.\"\n\n\"Where to?\" Slim inquired.\n\n\"Headquarters,\" Thurston told him. \"Washington--let's go!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom Los Angeles to Washington is not far, as the plane flies. There was\na stop or two for gasoline, but it was only a day later that they were\nseated in the War Office. Thurston's card had gained immediate\nadmittance. \"Got the low-down,\" he had written on the back of his card,\n\"on the mystery airship.\"\n\n\"What you have told me is incredible,\" the Secretary was saying,\n\"or would be if General Lozier here had not reported personally on\nthe occurrence at New York. But the monster, the thing you have\ndescribed.... Cy, if I didn't know you as I do I would have you locked\nup.\"\n\n\"It's true,\" said Thurston, simply. \"It's damnable, but it's true. Now\nwhat does it mean?\"\n\n\"Heaven knows,\" was the response. \"That's where it came from--out of the\nheavens.\"\n\n\"Not what we saw,\" Slim Riley broke in. \"That thing came straight out of\nHell.\" And in his voice was no suggestion of levity.\n\n\"You left Los Angeles early yesterday; have you seen the papers?\"\n\nThurston shook his head.\n\n\"They are back,\" said the Secretary. \"Reported over London--Paris--the\nWest Coast. Even China has seen them. Shanghai cabled an hour ago.\"\n\n\"Them? How many are there?\"\n\n\"Nobody knows. There were five seen at one time. There are more--unless\nthe same ones go around the world in a matter of minutes.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThurston remembered that whirlwind of vapor and a vanishing speck in the\nArizona sky. \"They could,\" he asserted. \"They're faster than anything on\nearth. Though what drives them ... that gas--steam--whatever it is....\"\n\n\"Hydrogen,\" stated General Lozier. \"I saw the New York show when poor\nDavis got his. He flew into the exhaust; it went off like a million\nbombs. Characteristic hydrogen flame trailed the damn thing up out of\nsight--a tail of blue fire.\"\n\n\"And cold,\" stated Thurston.\n\n\"Hot as a Bunsen burner,\" the General contradicted. \"Davis' plane almost\nmelted.\"\n\n\"Before it ignited,\" said the other. He told of the cold in their plane.\n\n\"Ha!\" The General spoke explosively. \"That's expansion. That's a tip on\ntheir motive power. Expansion of gas. That accounts for the cold and\nthe vapor. Suddenly expanded it would be intensely cold. The moisture of\nthe air would condense, freeze. But how could they carry it? Or\"--he\nfrowned for a moment, brows drawn over deep-set gray eyes--\"or generate\nit? But that's crazy--that's impossible!\"\n\n\"So is the whole matter,\" the Secretary reminded him. \"With the\ninformation Mr. Thurston and Mr. Riley have given us, the whole affair\nis beyond any gage our past experience might supply. We start from the\nimpossible, and we go--where? What is to be done?\"\n\n\"With your permission, sir, a number of things shall be done. It would\nbe interesting to see what a squadron of planes might accomplish, diving\non them from above. Or anti-aircraft fire.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"No,\" said the Secretary of War, \"not yet. They have looked us over,\nbut they have not attacked. For the present we do not know what they\nare. All of us have our suspicions--thoughts of interplanetary\ntravel--thoughts too wild for serious utterance--but we know nothing.\n\n\"Say nothing to the papers of what you have told me,\" he directed\nThurston. \"Lord knows their surmises are wild enough now. And for you,\nGeneral, in the event of any hostile move, you will resist.\"\n\n\"Your order was anticipated, sir.\" The General permitted himself a\nslight smile. \"The air force is ready.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" the Secretary of War nodded. \"Meet me here to-night--nine\no'clock.\" He included Thurston and Riley in the command. \"We need to\nthink ... to think ... and perhaps their mission is friendly.\"\n\n\"Friendly!\" The two flyers exchanged glances as they went to the door.\nAnd each knew what the other was seeing--a viscous ocherous mass that\nformed into a head where eyes devilish in their hate stared coldly into\ntheirs....\n\n\"Think, we need to think,\" repeated Thurston later. \"A creature that is\njust one big hideous brain, that can think an arm into existence--think\na head where it wishes! What does a thing like that think of? What\nbeastly thoughts could that--that _thing_ conceive?\"\n\n\"If I got the sights of a Lewis gun on it,\" said Riley vindictively,\n\"I'd make it think.\"\n\n\"And my guess is that is all you would accomplish,\" Thurston told him.\n\"I am forming a few theories about our visitors. One is that it would be\nquite impossible to find a vital spot in that big homogeneous mass.\"\n\nThe pilot dispensed with theories: his was a more literal mind. \"Where\non earth did they come from, do you suppose, Mr. Thurston?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were walking to their hotel. Thurston raised his eyes to the summer\nheavens. Faint stars were beginning to twinkle; there was one that\nglowed steadily.\n\n\"Nowhere on earth,\" Thurston stated softly, \"nowhere on earth.\"\n\n\"Maybe so,\" said the pilot, \"maybe so. We've thought about it and talked\nabout it ... and they've gone ahead and done it.\" He called to a\nnewsboy; they took the latest editions to their room.\n\nThe papers were ablaze with speculation. There were dispatches from all\ncorners of the earth, interviews with scientists and near scientists.\nThe machines were a Soviet invention--they were beyond anything\nhuman--they were harmless--they would wipe out civilization--poison\ngas--blasts of fire like that which had enveloped the army flyer....\n\nAnd through it all Thurston read an ill-concealed fear, a reflection of\npanic that was gripping the nation--the whole world. These great\nmachines were sinister. Wherever they appeared came the sense of being\nwatched, of a menace being calmly withheld. And at thought of the\nobscene monsters inside those spheres, Thurston's lips were compressed\nand his eyes hardened. He threw the papers aside.\n\n\"They are here,\" he said, \"and that's all that we know. I hope the\nSecretary of War gets some good men together. And I hope someone is\ninspired with an answer.\"\n\n\"An answer is it?\" said Riley. \"I'm thinkin' that the answer will come,\nbut not from these swivel-chair fighters. 'Tis the boys in the cockpits\nwith one hand on the stick and one on the guns that will have the\nanswer.\"\n\nBut Thurston shook his head. \"Their speed,\" he said, \"and the gas!\nRemember that cold. How much of it can they lay over a city?\"\n\nThe question was unanswered, unless the quick ringing of the phone was a\nreply.\n\n\"War Department,\" said a voice. \"Hold the wire.\" The voice of the\nSecretary of War came on immediately.\n\n\"Thurston?\" he asked. \"Come over at once on the jump, old man. Hell's\npopping.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe windows of the War Department Building were all alight as they\napproached. Cars were coming and going; men in uniform, as the Secretary\nhad said, \"on the jump.\" Soldiers with bayonets stopped them, then\npassed Thurston and his companion on. Bells were ringing from all sides.\nBut in the Secretary's office was perfect quiet.\n\nGeneral Lozier was there, Thurston saw, and an imposing array of\ngold-braided men with a sprinkling of those in civilian clothes. One he\nrecognized: MacGregor from the Bureau of Standards. The Secretary handed\nThurston some papers.\n\n\"Radio,\" he explained. \"They are over the Pacific coast. Hit near\nVancouver; Associated Press says city destroyed. They are working down\nthe coast. Same story--blast of hydrogen from their funnel shaped base.\nColder than Greenland below them; snow fell in Seattle. No real attack\nsince Vancouver and little damage done--\" A message was laid before\nhim.\n\n\"Portland,\" he said. \"Five mystery ships over city. Dart repeatedly\ntoward earth, deliver blast of gas and then retreat. Doing no damage.\nApparently inviting attack. All commercial planes ordered grounded.\nAwaiting instructions.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said the Secretary, \"I believe I speak for all present when\nI say that, in the absence of first hand information, we are utterly\nunable to arrive at any definite conclusion or make a definite plan.\nThere is a menace in this, undeniably. Mr. Thurston and Mr. Riley have\nbeen good enough to report to me. They have seen one machine at close\nrange. It was occupied by a monster so incredible that the report would\nreceive no attention from me did I not know Mr. Thurston personally.\n\n\"Where have they come from? What does it mean--what is their mission?\nOnly God knows.\n\n\"Gentlemen, I feel that I must see them. I want General Lozier to\naccompany me, also Doctor MacGregor, to advise me from the scientific\nangle. I am going to the Pacific Coast. They may not wait--that is\ntrue--but they appear to be going slowly south. I will leave to-night\nfor San Diego. I hope to intercept them. We have strong air-forces\nthere; the Navy Department is cooperating.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe waited for no comment. \"General,\" he ordered, \"will you kindly\narrange for a plane? Take an escort or not as you think best.\n\n\"Mr. Thurston and Mr. Riley will also accompany us. We want all the\nauthoritative data we can get. This on my return will be placed before\nyou, gentlemen, for your consideration.\" He rose from his chair. \"I hope\nthey wait for us,\" he said.\n\nTime was when a commander called loudly for a horse, but in this day a\nSecretary of War is not kept waiting for transportation. Sirening\nmotorcycles preceded them from the city. Within an hour, motors roaring\nwide open, propellers ripping into the summer night, lights slipping\neastward three thousand feet below, the Secretary of War for the United\nStates was on his way. And on either side from their plane stretched the\narms of a V. Like a flight of gigantic wild geese, fast fighting planes\nof the Army air service bored steadily into the night, guarantors of\nsafe convoy.\n\n\"The Air Service is ready,\" General Lozier had said. And Thurston and\nhis pilot knew that from East coast to West, swift scout planes, whose\nidling engines could roar into action at a moment's notice, stood\nwaiting; battle planes hidden in hangars would roll forth at the\nword--the Navy was cooperating--and at San Diego there were strong naval\nunits, Army units, and Marine Corps.\n\n\"They don't know what we can do, what we have up our sleeve: they are\nfeeling us out,\" said the Secretary. They had stopped more than once for\ngas and for wireless reports. He held a sheaf of typewritten briefs.\n\n\"Going slowly south. They have taken their time. Hours over San\nFrancisco and the bay district. Repeating same tactics; fall with\nterrific speed to cushion against their blast of gas. Trying to draw us\nout, provoke an attack, make us show our strength. Well, we shall beat\nthem to San Diego at this rate. We'll be there in a few hours.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe afternoon sun was dropping ahead of them when they sighted the\nwater. \"Eckener Pass,\" the pilot told them, \"where the Graf Zeppelin\ncame through. Wonder what these birds would think of a Zepp!\n\n\"There's the ocean,\" he added after a time. San Diego glistened against\nthe bare hills. \"There's North Island--the Army field.\" He stared\nintently ahead, then shouted: \"And there they are! Look there!\"\n\nOver the city a cluster of meteors was falling. Dark underneath, their\ntops shone like pure silver in the sun's slanting glare. They fell\ntoward the city, then buried themselves in a dense cloud of steam,\nrebounding at once to the upper air, vapor trailing behind them.\n\nThe cloud billowed slowly. It struck the hills of the city, then lifted\nand vanished.\n\n\"Land at once,\" requested the Secretary. A flash of silver countermanded\nthe order.\n\nIt hung there before them, a great gleaming globe, keeping always its\ndistance ahead. It was elongated at the base, Thurston observed. From\nthat base shot the familiar blast that turned steamy a hundred feet\nbelow as it chilled the warm air. There were round orifices, like ports,\nranged around the top, where an occasional jet of vapor showed this to\nbe a method of control. Other spots shone dark and glassy. Were they\nwindows? He hardly realized their peril, so interested was he in the\nstrange machine ahead.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen: \"Dodge that vapor,\" ordered General Lozier. The plane wavered in\nsignal to the others and swung sharply to the left. Each man knew the\nflaming death that was theirs if the fire of their exhaust touched that\nexplosive mixture of hydrogen and air. The great bubble turned with them\nand paralleled their course.\n\n\"He's watching us,\" said Riley, \"giving us the once over, the slimy\ndevil. Ain't there a gun on this ship?\"\n\nThe General addressed his superior. Even above the roar of the motors\nhis voice seemed quiet, assured. \"We must not land now,\" he said. \"We\ncan't land at North Island. It would focus their attention upon our\ndefenses. That thing--whatever it is--is looking for a vulnerable spot.\nWe must.... Hold on--there he goes!\"\n\nThe big bulb shot upward. It slanted above them, and hovered there.\n\n\"I think he is about to attack,\" said the General quietly. And, to the\ncommander of their squadron: \"It's in your hands now, Captain. It's\nyour fight.\"\n\nThe Captain nodded and squinted above. \"He's got to throw heavier stuff\nthan that,\" he remarked. A small object was falling from the cloud. It\npassed close to their ship.\n\n\"Half-pint size,\" said Cyrus Thurston, and laughed in derision. There\nwas something ludicrous in the futility of the attack. He stuck his head\nfrom a window into the gale they created. He sheltered his eyes to try\nto follow the missile in its fall.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were over the city. The criss-cross of streets made a grill-work of\nlines; tall buildings were dwarfed from this three thousand foot\naltitude. The sun slanted across a projecting promontory to make golden\nripples on a blue sea and the city sparkled back in the clear air. Tiny\nwhite faces were massed in the streets, huddled in clusters where the\nfutile black missile had vanished.\n\nAnd then--then the city was gone....\n\nA white cloud-bank billowed and mushroomed. Slowly, it seemed to the\nwatcher--so slowly.\n\nIt was done in the fraction of a second. Yet in that brief time his eyes\nregistered the chaotic sweep in advance of the cloud. There came a\ncrashing of buildings in some monster whirlwind, a white cloud engulfing\nit all.... It was rising--was on them.\n\n\"God,\" thought Thurston, \"why can't I move!\" The plane lifted and\nlurched. A thunder of sound crashed against them, an intolerable force.\nThey were crushed to the floor as the plane was hurled over and upward.\n\nOut of the mad whirling tangle of flying bodies, Thurston glimpsed one\nclear picture. The face of the pilot hung battered and blood-covered\nbefore him, and over the limp body the hand of Slim Riley clutched at\nthe switch.\n\n\"Bully boy,\" he said dazedly, \"he's cutting the motors....\" The thought\nended in blackness.\n\nThere was no sound of engines or beating propellers when he came to his\nsenses. Something lay heavy upon him. He pushed it to one side. It was\nthe body of General Lozier.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe drew himself to his knees to look slowly about, rubbed stupidly at\nhis eyes to quiet the whirl, then stared at the blood on his hand. It\nwas so quiet--the motors--what was it that happened? Slim had reached\nfor the switch....\n\nThe whirling subsided. Before him he saw Slim Riley at the controls. He\ngot to his feet and went unsteadily forward. It was a battered face that\nwas lifted to his.\n\n\"She was spinning,\" the puffed lips were muttering slowly. \"I brought\nher out ... there's the field....\" His voice was thick; he formed the\nwords slowly, painfully. \"Got to land ... can you take it? I'm--I'm--\"\nHe slumped limply in his seat.\n\nThurston's arms were uninjured. He dragged the pilot to the floor and\ngot back of the wheel. The field was below them. There were planes\ntaxiing out; he heard the roar of their motors. He tried the controls.\nThe plane answered stiffly, but he managed to level off as the brown\nfield approached.\n\nThurston never remembered that landing. He was trying to drag Riley from\nthe battered plane when the first man got to him.\n\n\"Secretary of War?\" he gasped. \"In there.... Take Riley; I can walk.\"\n\n\"We'll get them,\" an officer assured him. \"Knew you were coming. They\nsure gave you hell! But look at the city!\"\n\nArms carried him stumbling from the field. Above the low hangars he saw\nsmoke clouds over the bay. These and red rolling flames marked what had\nbeen an American city. Far in the heavens moved five glinting specks.\n\nHis head reeled with the thunder of engines. There were planes standing\nin lines and more erupting from hangars, where khaki-clad men, faces\ntense under leather helmets, rushed swiftly about.\n\n\"General Lozier is dead,\" said a voice. Thurston turned to the man. They\nwere bringing the others. \"The rest are smashed up some,\" the officer\ntold him, \"but I think they'll pull through.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Secretary of War for the United States lay beside him. Men with red\non their sleeves were slitting his coat. Through one good eye he\nsquinted at Thurston. He even managed a smile.\n\n\"Well, I wanted to see them up close,\" he said. \"They say you saved us,\nold man.\"\n\nThurston waved that aside. \"Thank Riley--\" he began, but the words ended\nin the roar of an exhaust. A plane darted swiftly away to shoot\nvertically a hundred feet in the air. Another followed and another. In a\ncloud of brown dust they streamed endlessly out, zooming up like angry\nhornets, eager to get into the fight.\n\n\"Fast little devils!\" the ambulance man observed. \"Here come the big\nboys.\"\n\nA leviathan went deafeningly past. And again others came on in quick\nsuccession. Farther up the field, silvery gray planes with rudders\nflaunting their red, white and blue rose circling to the heights.\n\n\"That's the Navy,\" was the explanation. The surgeon straightened the\nSecretary's arm. \"See them come off the big airplane carriers!\"\n\nIf his remarks were part of his professional training in removing a\npatient's thoughts from his pain, they were effective. The Secretary\nstared out to sea, where two great flat-decked craft were shooting\nplanes with the regularity of a rapid fire gun. They stood out sharply\nagainst a bank of gray fog. Cyrus Thurston forgot his bruised body,\nforgot his own peril--even the inferno that raged back across the bay:\nhe was lost in the sheer thrill of the spectacle.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAbove them the sky was alive with winged shapes. And from all the\ndisorder there was order appearing. Squadron after squadron swept to\nbattle formation. Like flights of wild ducks the true sharp-pointed Vs\nsoared off into the sky. Far above and beyond, rows of dots marked the\nrace of swift scouts for the upper levels. And high in the clear air\nshone the glittering menace trailing their five plumes of gas.\n\nA deeper detonation was merging into the uproar. It came from the ships,\nThurston knew, where anti-aircraft guns poured a rain of shells into the\nsky. About the invaders they bloomed into clusters of smoke balls. The\nglobes shot a thousand feet into the air. Again the shells found them,\nand again they retreated.\n\n\"Look!\" said Thurston. \"They got one!\"\n\nHe groaned as a long curving arc of speed showed that the big bulb was\nunder control. Over the ships it paused, to balance and swing, then shot\nto the zenith as one of the great boats exploded in a cloud of vapor.\n\nThe following blast swept the airdrome. Planes yet on the ground went\nlike dry autumn leaves. The hangars were flattened.\n\nThurston cowered in awe. They were sheltered, he saw, by a slope of the\nground. No ridicule now for the bombs!\n\nA second blast marked when the gas-cloud ignited. The billowing flames\nwere blue. They writhed in tortured convulsions through the air. Endless\nexplosions merged into one rumbling roar.\n\nMacGregor had roused from his stupor; he raised to a sitting position.\n\n\"Hydrogen,\" he stated positively, and pointed where great volumes of\nflame were sent whirling aloft. \"It burns as it mixes with air.\" The\nscientist was studying intently the mammoth reaction. \"But the volume,\"\nhe marveled, \"the volume! From that small container! Impossible!\"\n\n\"Impossible,\" the Secretary agreed, \"but....\" He pointed with his one\ngood arm toward the Pacific. Two great ships of steel, blackened and\nbattered in that fiery breath, tossed helplessly upon the pitching,\nheaving sea. They furnished to the scientist's exclamation the only\nadequate reply.\n\nEach man stared aghast into the pallid faces of his companions. \"I think\nwe have underestimated the opposition,\" said the Secretary of War\nquietly. \"Look--the fog is coming in, but it's too late to save them.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe big ships were vanishing in the oncoming fog. Whirls of vapor were\neddying toward them in the flame-blaster air. Above them the watchers\nsaw dimly the five gleaming bulbs. There were airplanes attacking: the\ntapping of machine-gun fire came to them faintly.\n\nFast planes circled and swooped toward the enemy. An armada of big\nplanes drove in from beyond. Formations were blocking space above....\nEvery branch of the service was there, Thurston exulted, the army,\nMarine Corps, the Navy. He gripped hard at the dry ground in a paralysis\nof taut nerves. The battle was on, and in the balance hung the fate of\nthe world.\n\nThe fog drove in fast. Through straining eyes he tried in vain to\nglimpse the drama spread above. The world grew dark and gray. He buried\nhis face in his hands.\n\nAnd again came the thunder. The men on the ground forced their gaze to\nthe clouds, though they knew some fresh horror awaited.\n\nThe fog-clouds reflected the blue terror above. They were riven and\ntorn. And through them black objects were falling. Some blazed as they\nfell. They slipped into unthought maneuvers--they darted to earth\ntrailing yellow and black of gasoline fires. The air was filled with the\ndread rain of death that was spewed from the gray clouds. Gone was the\nroaring of motors. The air-force of the San Diego area swept in silence\nto the earth, whose impact alone could give kindly concealment to their\nflame-stricken burden.\n\nThurston's last control snapped. He flung himself flat to bury his face\nin the sheltering earth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOnly the driving necessity of work to be done saved the sanity of the\nsurvivors. The commercial broadcasting stations were demolished, a part\nof the fuel for the terrible furnace across the bay. But the Naval radio\nstation was beyond on an outlying hill. The Secretary of War was in\ncharge. An hour's work and this was again in commission to flash to the\nworld the story of disaster. It told the world also of what lay ahead.\nThe writing was plain. No prophet was needed to forecast the doom and\ndestruction that awaited the earth.\n\nCivilization was helpless. What of armies and cannon, of navies, of\naircraft, when from some unreachable height these monsters within their\nbulbous machines could drop coldly--methodically--their diminutive\nbombs. And when each bomb meant shattering destruction; each explosion\nblasting all within a radius of miles; each followed by the blue blast\nof fire that melted the twisted framework of buildings and powdered the\nstones to make of a proud city a desolation of wreckage, black and\nsilent beneath the cold stars. There was no crumb of comfort for the\nworld in the terror the radio told.\n\nSlim Riley was lying on an improvised cot when Thurston and the\nrepresentative of the Bureau of Standards joined him. Four walls of a\nroom still gave shelter in a half-wrecked building. There were candles\nburning: the dark was unbearable.\n\n\"Sit down,\" said MacGregor quietly; \"we must think....\"\n\n\"Think!\" Thurston's voice had an hysterical note. \"I can't think! I\nmustn't think! I'll go raving crazy....\"\n\n\"Yes, think,\" said the scientist. \"Had it occurred to you that that is\nour only weapon left?\n\n\"We must think, we must analyze. Have these devils a vulnerable spot? Is\nthere any known means of attack? We do not know. We must learn. Here in\nthis room we have all the direct information the world possesses of this\nmenace. I have seen their machines in operation. You have seen more--you\nhave looked at the monsters themselves. At one of them, anyway.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe man's voice was quiet, methodical. Mr. MacGregor was attacking a\nproblem. Problems called for concentration; not hysterics. He could have\npoured the contents from a beaker without spilling a drop. His poise was\nneeded: they were soon to make a laboratory experiment.\n\nThe door burst open to admit a wild-eyed figure that snatched up their\ncandles and dashed them to the floor.\n\n\"Lights out!\" he screamed at them. \"There's one of 'em coming back.\" He\nwas gone from the room.\n\nThe men sprang for the door, then turned to where Riley was clumsily\ncrawling from his couch. An arm under each of his, and the three men\nstumbled from the room.\n\nThey looked about them in the night. The fog-banks were high, drifting\nin from the ocean. Beneath them the air was clear; from somewhere above\na hidden moon forced a pale light through the clouds. And over the\nocean, close to the water, drifted a familiar shape. Familiar in its\nhuge sleek roundness, in its funnel-shaped base where a soft roar made\nvaporous clouds upon the water. Familiar, too, in the wild dread it\ninspired.\n\nThe watchers were spellbound. To Thurston there came a fury of impotent\nfrenzy. It was so near! His hands trembled to tear at that door, to rip\nat that foul mass he knew was within.... The great bulb drifted past. It\nwas nearing the shore. But its action! Its motion!\n\nGone was the swift certainty of control. The thing settled and sank, to\nrise weakly with a fresh blast of gas from its exhaust. It settled\nagain, and passed waveringly on in the night.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThurston was throbbingly alive with hope that was certainty. \"It's been\nhit,\" he exulted; \"it's been hit. Quick! After it, follow it!\" He dashed\nfor a car. There were some that had been salvaged from the less ruined\nbuildings. He swung it quickly around where the others were waiting.\n\n\"Get a gun,\" he commanded. \"Hey, you,\"--to an officer who\nappeared--\"your pistol, man, quick! We're going after it!\" He caught the\ntossed gun and hurried the others into the car.\n\n\"Wait,\" MacGregor commanded. \"Would you hunt elephants with a pop-gun?\nOr these things?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the other told him, \"or my bare hands! Are you coming, or aren't\nyou?\"\n\nThe physicist was unmoved. \"The creature you saw--you said that it\nwrithed in a bright light--you said it seemed almost in agony. There's\nan idea there! Yes, I'm going with you, but keep your shirt on, and\nthink.\"\n\nHe turned again to the officer. \"We need lights,\" he explained, \"bright\nlights. What is there? Magnesium? Lights of any kind?\"\n\n\"Wait.\" The man rushed off into the dark.\n\nHe was back in a moment to thrust a pistol into the car. \"Flares,\" he\nexplained. \"Here's a flashlight, if you need it.\" The car tore at the\nground as Thurston opened it wide. He drove recklessly toward the\nhighway that followed the shore.\n\nThe high fog had thinned to a mist. A full moon was breaking through to\ntouch with silver the white breakers hissing on the sand. It spread its\nfull glory on dunes and sea: one more of the countless soft nights where\npeace and calm beauty told of an ageless existence that made naught of\nthe red havoc of men or of monsters. It shone on the ceaseless surf\nthat had beaten these shores before there were men, that would thunder\nthere still when men were no more. But to the tense crouching men in the\ncar it shone only ahead on a distant, glittering speck. A wavering\nreflection marked the uncertain flight of the stricken enemy.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThurston drove like a maniac; the road carried them straight toward\ntheir quarry. What could he do when he overtook it? He neither knew nor\ncared. There was only the blind fury forcing him on within reach of the\nthing. He cursed as the lights of the car showed a bend in the road. It\nwas leaving the shore.\n\nHe slackened their speed to drive cautiously into the sand. It dragged\nat the car, but he fought through to the beach, where he hoped for firm\nfooting. The tide was out. They tore madly along the smooth sand,\nbreakers clutching at the flying wheels.\n\nThe strange aircraft was nearer; it was plainly over the shore, they\nsaw. Thurston groaned as it shot high in the air in an effort to clear\nthe cliffs ahead. But the heights were no longer a refuge. Again it\nsettled. It struck on the cliff to rebound in a last futile leap. The\ngreat pear shape tilted, then shot end over end to crash hard on the\nfirm sand. The lights of the car struck the wreck, and they saw the\nshell roll over once. A ragged break was opening--the spherical top fell\nslowly to one side. It was still rocking as they brought the car to a\nstop. Filling the lower shell, they saw dimly, was a mucouslike mass\nthat seethed and struggled in the brilliance of their lights.\n\nMacGregor was persisting in his theory. \"Keep the lights on it!\" he\nshouted. \"It can't stand the light.\"\n\nWhile they watched, the hideous, bubbling beast oozed over the side of\nthe broken shell to shelter itself in the shadow beneath. And again\nThurston sensed the pulse and throb of life in the monstrous mass.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe saw again in his rage the streaming rain of black airplanes; saw,\ntoo, the bodies, blackened and charred as they saw them when first they\ntried rescue from the crashed ships; the smoke clouds and flames from\nthe blasted city, where people--his people, men and women and little\nchildren--had met terrible death. He sprang from the car. Yet he\nfaltered with a revulsion that was almost a nausea. His gun was gripped\nin his hand as he ran toward the monster.\n\n\"Come back!\" shouted MacGregor. \"Come back! Have you gone mad?\" He was\njerking at the door of the car.\n\nBeyond the white funnel of their lights a yellow thing was moving. It\ntwisted and flowed with incredible speed a hundred feet back to the base\nof the cliff. It drew itself together in a quivering heap.\n\nAn out-thrusting rock threw a sheltering shadow; the moon was low in the\nwest. In the blackness a phosphorescence was apparent. It rippled and\nrose in the dark with the pulsing beat of the jellylike mass. And\nthrough it were showing two discs. Gray at first, they formed to black,\nstaring eyes.\n\nThurston had followed. His gun was raised as he neared it. Then out of\nthe mass shot a serpentine arm. It whipped about him, soft, sticky,\nviscid--utterly loathsome. He screamed once when it clung to his face,\nthen tore savagely and in silence at the encircling folds.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe gun! He ripped a blinding mass from his face and emptied the\nautomatic in a stream of shots straight toward the eyes. And he knew as\nhe fired that the effort was useless; to have shot at the milky surf\nwould have been as vain.\n\nThe thing was pulling him irresistibly; he sank to his knees; it dragged\nhim over the sand. He clutched at a rock. A vision was before him: the\ncarcass of a steer, half absorbed and still bleeding on the sand of an\nArizona desert....\n\nTo be drawn to the smothering embrace of that glutinous mass ... for\nthat monstrous appetite.... He tore afresh at the unyielding folds, then\nknew MacGregor was beside him.\n\nIn the man's hand was a flashlight. The scientist risked his life on a\nguess. He thrust the powerful light into the clinging serpent. It was\nlike the touch of hot iron to human flesh. The arm struggled and flailed\nin a paroxysm of pain.\n\nThurston was free. He lay gasping on the sand. But MacGregor!... He\nlooked up to see him vanish in the clinging ooze. Another thick tentacle\nhad been projected from the main mass to sweep like a whip about the\nman. It hissed as it whirled about him in the still air.\n\nThe flashlight was gone; Thurston's hand touched it in the sand. He\nsprang to his feet and pressed the switch. No light responded; the\nflashlight was out--broken.\n\nA thick arm slashed and wrapped about him.... It beat him to the ground.\nThe sand was moving beneath him; he was being dragged swiftly,\nhelplessly, toward what waited in the shadow. He was smothering.... A\nblinding glare filled his eyes....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe flares were still burning when he dared look about. MacGregor was\npulling frantically at his arm. \"Quick--quick!\" he was shouting.\nThurston scrambled to his feet.\n\nOne glimpse he caught of a heaving yellow mass in the white light; it\ntwisted in horrible convulsions. They ran stumblingly--drunkenly--toward\nthe car.\n\nRiley was half out of the machine. He had tried to drag himself to their\nassistance. \"I couldn't make it,\" he said: \"then I thought of the\nflares.\"\n\n\"Thank Heaven,\" said MacGregor with emphasis, \"it was your legs that\nwere paralyzed, Riley, not your brain.\"\n\nThurston found his voice. \"Let me have that Very pistol. If light hurts\nthat damn thing, I am going to put a blaze of magnesium into the middle\nof it if I die for it.\"\n\n\"They're all gone,\" said Riley.\n\n\"Then let's get out of here. I've had enough. We can come back later\non.\"\n\nHe got back of the wheel and slammed the door of the sedan. The\nmoonlight was gone. The darkness was velvet just tinged with the gray\nthat precedes the dawn. Back in the deeper blackness at the cliff-base a\nphosphorescent something wavered and glowed. The light rippled and\nflowed in all directions over the mass. Thurston felt, vaguely, its\nmystery--the bulk was a vast, naked brain; its quiverings were like\nvisible thought waves....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe phosphorescence grew brighter. The thing was approaching. Thurston\nlet in his clutch, but the scientist checked him.\n\n\"Wait,\" he implored, \"wait! I wouldn't miss this for the world.\" He\nwaved toward the east, where far distant ranges were etched in palest\nrose.\n\n\"We know less than nothing of these creatures, in what part\nof the universe they are spawned, how they live, where they\nlive--Saturn!--Mars!--the Moon! But--we shall soon know how one dies!\"\n\nThe thing was coming from the cliff. In the dim grayness it seemed less\nyellow, less fluid. A membrane enclosed it. It was close to the car. Was\nit hunger that drove it, or cold rage for these puny opponents? The\nhollow eyes were glaring; a thick arm formed quickly to dart out toward\nthe car. A cloud, high above, caught the color of approaching day....\n\nBefore their eyes the vile mass pulsed visibly; it quivered and beat.\nThen, sensing its danger, it darted like some headless serpent for its\nmachine.\n\nIt massed itself about the shattered top to heave convulsively. The top\nwas lifted, carried toward the rest of the great metal egg. The sun's\nfirst rays made golden arrows through the distant peaks.\n\nThe struggling mass released its burden to stretch its vile length\ntoward the dark caves under the cliffs. The last sheltering fog-veil\nparted. The thing was halfway to the high bank when the first bright\nshaft of direct sunlight shot through.\n\nIncredible in the concealment of night, the vast protoplasmic pod was\ndoubly so in the glare of day. But it was there before them, not a\nhundred feet distant. And it boiled in vast tortured convulsions. The\nclean sunshine struck it, and the mass heaved itself into the air in a\nnauseous eruption, then fell limply to the earth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe yellow membrane turned paler. Once more the staring black eyes\nformed to turn hopelessly toward the sheltering globe. Then the bulk\nflattened out on the sand. It was a jellylike mound, through which\ntrembled endless quivering palpitations.\n\nThe sun struck hot, and before the eyes of the watching, speechless men\nwas a sickening, horrible sight--a festering mass of corruption.\n\nThe sickening yellow was liquid. It seethed and bubbled with liberated\ngases; it decomposed to purplish fluid streams. A breath of wind blew in\ntheir direction. The stench from the hideous pool was overpowering,\nunbearable. Their heads swam in the evil breath.... Thurston ripped the\ngears into reverse, nor stopped until they were far away on the clean\nsand.\n\nThe tide was coming in when they returned. Gone was the vile\nputrescence. The waves were lapping at the base of the gleaming machine.\n\n\"We'll have to work fast,\" said MacGregor. \"I must know, I must learn.\"\nHe drew himself up and into the shattered shell.\n\nIt was of metal, some forty feet across, its framework a maze of\nlatticed struts. The central part was clear. Here in a wide, shallow pan\nthe monster had rested. Below this was tubing, intricate coils, massive,\nheavy and strong. MacGregor lowered himself upon it, Thurston was\nbeside him. They went down into the dim bowels of the deadly instrument.\n\n\"Hydrogen,\" the physicist was stating. \"Hydrogen--there's our starting\npoint. A generator, obviously, forming the gas--from what? They couldn't\ncompress it! They couldn't carry it or make it, not the volume that they\nevolved. But they did it, they did it!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nClose to the coils a dim light was glowing. It was a pin-point of\nradiance in the half-darkness about them. The two men bent closer.\n\n\"See,\" directed MacGregor, \"it strikes on this mirror--bright metal and\nparabolic. It disperses the light, doesn't concentrate it! Ah! Here is\nanother, and another. This one is bent--broken. They are adjustable. Hm!\nMicrometer accuracy for reducing the light. The last one could reflect\nthrough this slot. It's light that does it, Thurston, it's light that\ndoes it!\"\n\n\"Does what?\" Thurston had followed the other's analysis of the diffusion\nprocess. \"The light that would finally reach that slot would be hardly\nperceptible.\"\n\n\"It's the agent,\" said MacGregor, \"the activator--the catalyst! What\ndoes it strike upon? I must know--I must!\"\n\nThe waves were splashing outside the shell. Thurston turned in a\nfeverish search of the unexplored depths. There was a surprising\nsimplicity, an absence of complicated mechanism. The generator, with its\ntremendous braces to carry its thrust to the framework itself, filled\nmost of the space. Some of the ribs were thicker, he noticed. Solid\nmetal, as if they might carry great weights. Resting upon them were\nranged numbers of objects. They were like eggs, slender, and inches in\nlength. On some were propellers. They worked through the shells on long\nslender rods. Each was threaded finely--an adjustable arm engaged the\nthread. Thurston called excitedly to the other.\n\n\"Here they are,\" he said. \"Look! Here are the shells. Here's what blew\nus up!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe pointed to the slim shafts with their little propellerlike fans.\n\"Adjustable, see? Unwind in their fall ... set 'em for any length of\ntravel ... fires the charge in the air. That's how they wiped out our\nair fleet.\"\n\nThere were others without the propellers; they had fins to hold them\nnose downward. On each nose was a small rounded cap.\n\n\"Detonators of some sort,\" said MacGregor. \"We've got to have one. We\nmust get it out quick; the tide's coming in.\" He laid his hands upon one\nof the slim, egg-shaped things. He lifted, then strained mightily. But\nthe object did not rise; it only rolled sluggishly.\n\nThe scientist stared at it amazed. \"Specific gravity,\" he exclaimed,\n\"beyond anything known! There's nothing on earth ... there is no such\nsubstance ... no form of matter....\" His eyes were incredulous.\n\n\"Lots to learn,\" Thurston answered grimly. \"We've yet to learn how to\nfight off the other four.\"\n\nThe other nodded. \"Here's the secret,\" he said. \"These shells liberate\nthe same gas that drives the machine. Solve one and we solve both--then\nwe learn how to combat it. But how to remove it--that is the problem.\nYou and I can never lift this out of here.\"\n\nHis glance darted about. There was a small door in the metal beam. The\ngroove in which the shells were placed led to it; it was a port for\nlaunching the projectiles. He moved it, opened it. A dash of spray\nstruck him in the face. He glanced inquiringly at his companion.\n\n\"Dare we do it?\" he asked. \"Slide one of them out?\"\n\nEach man looked long into the eyes of the other. Was this, then, the end\nof their terrible night? One shell to be dropped--then a bursting\nvolcano to blast them to eternity....\n\n\"The boys in the planes risked it,\" said Thurston quietly. \"They got\ntheirs.\" He stopped for a broken fragment of steel. \"Try one with a fan\non; it hasn't a detonator.\"\n\nThe men pried at the slim thing. It slid slowly toward the open port.\nOne heave and it balanced on the edge, then vanished abruptly. The spray\nwas cold on their faces. They breathed heavily with the realization that\nthey still lived.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were days of horror that followed, horror tempered by a numbing\nparalysis of all emotions. There were bodies by thousands to be heaped\nin the pit where San Diego had stood, to be buried beneath countless\ntons of debris and dirt. Trains brought an army of helpers; airplanes\ncame with doctors and nurses and the beginning of a mountain of\nsupplies. The need was there; it must be met. Yet the whole world was\nwaiting while it helped, waiting for the next blow to fall.\n\nTelegraph service was improvised, and radio receivers rushed in. The\nnews of the world was theirs once more. And it told of a terrified,\nwaiting world. There would be no temporizing now on the part of the\ninvaders. They had seen the airplanes swarming from the ground--they\nwould know an airdrome next time from the air. Thurston had noted the\nwindows in the great shell, windows of dull-colored glass which would\nprotect the darkness of the interior, essential to life for the horrible\noccupant, but through which it could see. It could watch all directions\nat once.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe great shell had vanished from the shore. Pounding waves and the\nshifting sands of high tide had obliterated all trace. More than once\nhad Thurston uttered devout thanks for the chance shell from an\nanti-aircraft gun that had entered the funnel beneath the machine, had\nbent and twisted the arrangement of mirrors that he and MacGregor had\nseen, and, exploding, had cracked and broken the domed roof of the\nbulb. They had learned little, but MacGregor was up north within reach\nof Los Angeles laboratories. And he had with him the slim cylinder of\ndeath. He was studying, thinking.\n\nTelephone service had been established for official business. The whole\nnation-wide system, for that matter, was under military control. The\nSecretary of War had flown back to Washington. The whole world was on a\nwar basis. War! And none knew where they should defend themselves, nor\nhow.\n\nAn orderly rushed Thurston to the telephone. \"You are wanted at once;\nLos Angeles calling.\"\n\nThe voice of MacGregor was cool and unhurried as Thurston listened.\n\"Grab a plane, old man,\" he was saying, \"and come up here on the jump.\"\n\nThe phrase brought a grim smile to Thurston's tired lips. \"Hell's\npopping!\" the Secretary of War had added on that evening those long ages\nbefore. Did MacGregor have something? Was a different kind of hell\npreparing to pop? The thoughts flashed through the listener's mind.\n\n\"I need a good deputy,\" MacGregor said. \"You may be the whole works--may\nhave to carry on--but I'll tell you it all later. Meet me at the\nBiltmore.\"\n\n\"In less than two hours,\" Thurston assured him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA plane was at his disposal. Riley's legs were functioning again, after\na fashion. They kept the appointment with minutes to spare.\n\n\"Come on,\" said MacGregor, \"I'll talk to you in the car.\" The automobile\nwhirled them out of the city to race off upon a winding highway that\nclimbed into far hills. There was twenty miles of this; MacGregor had\ntime for his talk.\n\n\"They've struck,\" he told the two men. \"They were over Germany\nyesterday. The news was kept quiet: I got the last report a half-hour\nago. They pretty well wiped out Berlin. No air-force there. France and\nEngland sent a swarm of planes, from the reports. Poor devils! No need\nto tell you what they got. We've seen it first hand. They headed west\nover the Atlantic, the four machines. Gave England a burst or two from\nhigh up, paused over New York, then went on. But they're here somewhere,\nwe think. Now listen:\n\n\"How long was it from the time when you saw the first monster until we\nheard from them again?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThurston forced his mind back to those days that seemed so far in the\npast. He tried to remember.\n\n\"Four days,\" broke in Riley. \"It was the fourth day after we found the\ndevil feeding.\"\n\n\"Feeding!\" interrupted the scientist. \"That's the point I am making.\nFour days. Remember that!\n\n\"And we knew they were down in the Argentine five days ago--that's\nanother item kept from an hysterical public. They slaughtered some\nthousands of cattle; there were scores of them found where the\ndevils--I'll borrow Riley's word--where the devils had fed. Nothing left\nbut hide and bones.\n\n\"And--mark this--that was four days before they appeared over Berlin.\n\n\"Why? Don't ask me. Do they have to lie quiet for that period miles up\nthere in space? God knows. Perhaps! These things seem outside the\nknowledge of a deity. But enough of that! Remember: four days! Let us\nassume that there is this four days waiting period. It will help us to\ntime them. I'll come back to that later.\n\n\"Here is what I have been doing. We know that light is a means of\nattack. I believe that the detonators we saw on those bombs merely\nopened a seal in the shell and forced in a flash of some sort. I believe\nthat radiant energy is what fires the blast.\n\n\"What is it that explodes? Nobody knows. We have opened the shell,\nworking in the absolute blackness of a room a hundred feet underground.\nWe found in it a powder--two powders, to be exact.\n\n\"They are mixed. One is finely divided, the other rather granular. Their\nspecific gravity is enormous, beyond anything known to physical science\nunless it would be the hypothetical neutron masses we think are in\ncertain stars. But this is not matter as we know matter; it is something\nnew.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Our theory is this: the hydrogen atom has been split, resolved into\ncomponents, not of electrons and the proton centers, but held at some\nhalfway point of decomposition. Matter composed only of neutrons would\nbe heavy beyond belief. This fits the theory in that respect. But the\npoint is this: When these solids are formed--they are dense--they\nrepresent in a cubic centimeter possibly a cubic mile of hydrogen gas\nunder normal pressure. That's a guess, but it will give you the idea.\n\n\"Not compressed, you understand, but all the elements present in other\nthan elemental form for the reconstruction of the atom ... for a million\nbillions of atoms.\n\n\"Then the light strikes it. These dense solids become instantly a\ngas--miles of it held in that small space.\n\n\"There you have it: the gas, the explosion, the entire absence of\nheat--which is to say, its terrific cold--when it expands.\"\n\nSlim Riley was looking bewildered but game. \"Sure, I saw it snow,\" he\naffirmed, \"so I guess the rest must be O.K. But what are we going to do\nabout it? You say light kills 'em, and fires their bombs. But how can we\nlet light into those big steel shells, or the little ones either?\"\n\n\"Not through those thick walls,\" said MacGregor. \"Not light. One of our\nanti-aircraft shells made a direct hit. That might not happen again in a\nmillion shots. But there are other forms of radiant energy that do\npenetrate steel....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe car had stopped beside a grove of eucalyptus. A barren, sun-baked\nhillside stretched beyond. MacGregor motioned them to alight.\n\nRiley was afire with optimism. \"And do you believe it?\" he asked\neagerly. \"Do you believe that we've got 'em licked?\"\n\nThurston, too, looked into MacGregor's face: Riley was not the only one\nwho needed encouragement. But the gray eyes were suddenly tired and\nhopeless.\n\n\"You ask what I believe,\" said the scientist slowly. \"I believe we are\nwitnessing the end of the world, our world of humans, their struggles,\ntheir grave hopes and happiness and aspirations....\"\n\nHe was not looking at them. His gaze was far off in space.\n\n\"Men will struggle and fight with their puny weapons, but these monsters\nwill win, and they will have their way with us. Then more of them will\ncome. The world, I believe, is doomed....\"\n\nHe straightened his shoulders. \"But we can die fighting,\" he added, and\npointed over the hill.\n\n\"Over there,\" he said, \"in the valley beyond, is a charge of their\nexplosive and a little apparatus of mine. I intend to fire the charge\nfrom a distance of three hundred yards. I expect to be safe, perfectly\nsafe. But accidents happen.\n\n\"In Washington a plane is being prepared. I have given instructions\nthrough hours of phoning. They are working night and day. It will\ncontain a huge generator for producing my ray. Nothing new! Just the\nproduct of our knowledge of radiant energy up to date. But the man who\nflies that plane will die--horribly. No time to experiment with\nprotection. The rays will destroy him, though he may live a month.\n\n\"I am asking you,\" he told Cyrus Thurston, \"to handle that plane. You\nmay be of service to the world--you may find you are utterly powerless.\nYou surely will die. But you know the machines and the monsters; your\nknowledge may be of value in an attack.\" He waited. The silence lasted\nfor only a moment.\n\n\"Why, sure,\" said Cyrus Thurston.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe looked at the eucalyptus grove with earnest appraisal. The sun made\nlovely shadows among their stripped trunks: the world was a beautiful\nplace. A lingering death, MacGregor had intimated--and horrible....\n\"Why, sure,\" he repeated steadily.\n\nSlim Riley shoved him firmly aside to stand facing MacGregor.\n\n\"Sure, hell!\" he said. \"I'm your man, Mr. MacGregor.\n\n\"What do you know about flying?\" he asked Cyrus Thurston. \"You're\ngood--for a beginner. But men like you two have got brains, and I'm\nthinkin' the world will be needin' them. Now me, all I'm good for is\nholdin' a shtick\"--his brogue had returned to his speech, and was\nevidence of his earnestness.\n\n\"And, besides\"--the smile faded from his lips, and his voice was\nsuddenly soft--\"them boys we saw take their last flip was just pilots to\nyou, just a bunch of good fighters. Well, they're buddies of mine. I\nfought beside some of them in France.... I belong!\"\n\nHe grinned happily at Thurston. \"Besides,\" he said, \"what do you know\nabout dog-fights?\"\n\nMacGregor gripped him by the hand. \"You win,\" he said. \"Report to\nWashington. The Secretary of War has all the dope.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe turned to Thurston. \"Now for you! Get this! The enemy machines almost\nattacked New York. One of them came low, then went back, and the four\nflashed out of sight toward the west. It is my belief that New York is\nnext, but the devils are hungry. The beast that attacked us was\nravenous, remember. They need food and lots of it. You will hear of\ntheir feeding, and you can count on four days. Keep Riley\ninformed--that's your job.\n\n\"Now I'm going over the hill. If this experiment works, there's a chance\nwe can repeat it on a larger scale. No certainty, but a chance! I'll be\nback. Full instructions at the hotel in case....\" He vanished into the\nscrub growth.\n\n\"Not exactly encouraging,\" Thurston pondered, \"but he's a good man, Mac,\na good egg! Not as big a brain as the one we saw, but perhaps it's a\nbetter one--cleaner--and it's working!\"\n\nThey were sheltered under the brow of the hill, but the blast from the\nvalley beyond rocked them like an earthquake. They rushed to the top of\nthe knoll. MacGregor was standing in the valley; he waved them a\ngreeting and shouted something unintelligible.\n\nThe gas had mushroomed into a cloud of steamy vapor. From above came\nsnowflakes to whirl in the churning mass, then fall to the ground. A\nwind came howling about them to beat upon the cloud. It swirled slowly\nback and down the valley. The figure of MacGregor vanished in its\nsmothering embrace.\n\n\"Exit, MacGregor!\" said Cyrus Thurston softly. He held tight to the\nstruggling figure of Slim Riley.\n\n\"He couldn't live a minute in that atmosphere of hydrogen,\" he\nexplained. \"They can--the devils!--but not a good egg like Mac. It's our\njob now--yours and mine.\"\n\nSlowly the gas retreated, lifted to permit their passage down the slope.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMacGregor was a good prophet. Thurston admitted that when, four days\nlater, he stood on the roof of the Equitable Building in lower New York.\n\nThe monsters had fed as predicted. Out in Wyoming a desolate area marked\nthe place of their meal, where a great herd of cattle lay smothered and\nfrozen. There were ranch houses, too, in the circle of destruction,\ntheir occupants frozen stiff as the carcasses that dotted the plains.\nThe country had stood tense for the following blow. Only Thurston had\nlived in certainty of a few days reprieve. And now had come the fourth\nday.\n\nIn Washington was Riley. Thurston had been in touch with him frequently.\n\n\"Sure, it's a crazy machine,\" the pilot had told him, \"and 'tis not much\nI think of it at all. Neither bullets nor guns, just this big glass\ncontraption and speed. She's fast, man, she's fast ... but it's little\nhope I have.\" And Thurston, remembering the scientist's words, was\nheartless and sick with dreadful certainty.\n\nThere were aircraft ready near New York; it was generally felt that here\nwas the next objective. The enemy had looked it over carefully. And\nWashington, too, was guarded. The nation's capital must receive what\nlittle help the aircraft could afford.\n\nThere were other cities waiting for destruction. If not this\ntime--later! The horror hung over them all.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe fourth day! And Thurston was suddenly certain of the fate of New\nYork. He hurried to a telephone. Of the Secretary of War he implored\nassistance.\n\n\"Send your planes,\" he begged. \"Here's where we will get it next. Send\nRiley. Let's make a last stand--win or lose.\"\n\n\"I'll give you a squadron,\" was the concession. \"What difference whether\nthey die there or here...?\" The voice was that of a weary man, weary\nand sleepless and hopeless.\n\n\"Good-by Cy, old man!\" The click of the receiver sounded in Thurston's\near. He returned to the roof for his vigil.\n\nTo wait, to stride nervously back and forth in impotent expectancy. He\ncould leave, go out into open country, but what were a few days or\nmonths--or a year--with this horror upon them? It was the end. MacGregor\nwas right. \"Good old Mac!\"\n\nThere were airplanes roaring overhead. It meant.... Thurston abruptly\nwas cold; a chill gripped at his heart.\n\nThe paroxysm passed. He was doubled with laughter--or was it he who was\nlaughing? He was suddenly buoyantly carefree. Who was he that it\nmattered? Cyrus Thurston--an ant! And their ant-hill was about to be\nsnuffed out....\n\nHe walked over to a waiting group and clapped one man on the shoulder.\n\"Well, how does it feel to be an ant?\" he inquired and laughed loudly at\nthe jest. \"You and your millions of dollars, your acres of factories,\nyour steamships, railroads!\"\n\nThe man looked at him strangely and edged cautiously away. His eyes,\nlike those of the others, had a dazed, stricken look. A woman was\nsobbing softly as she clung to her husband. From the streets far below\ncame a quavering shrillness of sound.\n\nThe planes gathered in climbing circles. Far on the horizon were four\ntiny glinting specks....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThurston stared until his eyes were stinging. He was walking in a waking\nsleep as he made his way to the stone coping beyond which was the street\nfar below. He was dead--dead!--right this minute. What were a few\nminutes more or less? He could climb over the coping; none of the\nhuddled, fear-gripped group would stop him. He could step out into space\nand fool them, the devils. They could never kill him....\n\nWhat was it MacGregor had said? Good egg, MacGregor! \"But we can die\nfighting....\" Yes, that was it--die fighting. But he couldn't fight; he\ncould only wait. Well, what were the others doing, down there in the\nstreets--in their homes? He could wait with them, die with them....\n\nHe straightened slowly and drew one long breath. He looked steadily and\nunafraid at the advancing specks. They were larger now. He could see\ntheir round forms. The planes were less noisy: they were far up in the\nheights--climbing--climbing.\n\nThe bulbs came slantingly down. They were separating. Thurston wondered\nvaguely.\n\nWhat had they done in Berlin? Yes, he remembered. Placed themselves at\nthe four corners of a great square and wiped out the whole city in one\nexplosion. Four bombs dropped at the same instant while they shot up to\nsafety in the thin air. How did they communicate? Thought transference,\nmost likely. Telepathy between those great brains, one to another. A\nplane was falling. It curved and swooped in a trail of flame, then fell\nstraight toward the earth. They were fighting....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThurston stared above. There were clusters of planes diving down from on\nhigh. Machine-guns stuttered faintly. \"Machine-guns--toys! Brave, that\nwas it! 'We can die fighting.'\" His thoughts were far off; it was like\nlistening to another's mind.\n\nThe air was filled with swelling clouds. He saw them before the blast\nstruck where he stood. The great building shuddered at the impact. There\nwere things falling from the clouds, wrecks of planes, blazing and\nshattered. Still came others; he saw them faintly through the clouds.\nThey came in from the West; they had gone far to gain altitude. They\ndrove down from the heights--the enemy had drifted--they were over the\nbay.\n\nMore clouds, and another blast thundering at the city. There were\nspecks, Thurston saw, falling into the water.\n\nAgain the invaders came down from the heights where they had escaped\ntheir own shattering attack. There was the faint roar of motors behind,\nfrom the south. The squadron from Washington passed overhead.\n\nThey surely had seen the fate that awaited. And they drove on to the\nattack, to strike at an enemy that shot instantly into the sky leaving\ncrashing destruction about the torn dead.\n\n\"Now!\" said Cyrus Thurston aloud.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe big bulbs were back. They floated easily in the air, a plume of\nvapor billowing beneath. They were ranging to the four corners of a\ngreat square.\n\nOne plane only was left, coming in from the south, a lone straggler,\nlate for the fray. One plane! Thurston's shoulders sagged heavily. All\nthey had left! It went swiftly overhead.... It was fast--fast. Thurston\nsuddenly knew. It was Riley in that plane.\n\n\"Go back, you fool!\"--he was screaming at the top of his\nvoice--\"Back--back--you poor, damned, decent Irishman!\"\n\nTears were streaming down his face. \"His buddies,\" Riley had said. And\nthis was Riley, driving swiftly in, alone, to avenge them....\n\nHe saw dimly as the swift plane sped over the first bulb, on and over\nthe second. The soft roar of gas from the machines drowned the sound of\nhis engine. The plane passed them in silence to bank sharply toward the\nthird corner of the forming square.\n\nHe was looking them over, Thurston thought. And the damn beasts\ndisregarded so contemptible an opponent. He could still leave. \"For\nGod's sake, Riley, beat it--escape!\"\n\nThurston's mind was solely on the fate of the lone voyager--until the\nimpossible was borne in upon him.\n\nThe square was disrupted. Three great bulbs were now drifting. The wind\nwas carrying them out toward the bay. They were coming down in a long,\nsmooth descent. The plane shot like a winged rocket at the fourth great,\nshining ball. To the watcher, aghast with sudden hope, it seemed barely\nto crawl.\n\n\"The ray! The ray....\" Thurston saw as if straining eyes had pierced\nthrough the distance to see the invisible. He saw from below the swift\nplane, the streaming, intangible ray. That was why Riley had flown\nclosely past and above them--the ray poured from below. His throat was\nchoking him, strangling....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe last enemy took alarm. Had it seen the slow sinking of its\ncompanions, failed to hear them in reply to his mental call? The shining\npear shape shot violently upward; the attacking plane rolled to a\nvertical bank as it missed the threatening clouds of exhaust. \"What do\nyou know about dog-fights?\" And Riley had grinned ... Riley belonged!\n\nThe bulb swelled before Thurston's eyes in its swift descent. It canted\nto one side to head off the struggling plane that could never escape,\ndid not try to escape. The steady wings held true upon their straight\ncourse. From above came the silver meteor; it seemed striking at the\nvery plane itself. It was almost upon it before it belched forth the\ncushioning blast of gas.\n\nThrough the forming clouds a plane bored in swiftly. It rolled slowly,\nwas flying upside down. It was under the enemy! Its ray.... Thurston was\nthrown a score of feet away to crash helpless into the stone coping by\nthe thunderous crash of the explosion.\n\nThere were fragments falling from a dense cloud--fragments of curved and\nsilvery metal ... the wing of a plane danced and fluttered in the\nair....\n\n\"He fired its bombs,\" whispered Thurston in a shaking voice. \"He killed\nthe other devils where they lay--he destroyed this with its own\nexplosive. He flew upside down to shoot up with the ray, to set off its\nshells....\"\n\nHis mind was fumbling with the miracle of it. \"Clever pilot, Riley, in a\ndog-fight....\" And then he realized.\n\nCyrus Thurston, millionaire sportsman, sank slowly, numbly to the roof\nof the Equitable Building that still stood. And New York was still there\n... and the whole world....\n\nHe sobbed weakly, brokenly. Through his dazed brain flashed a sudden,\nmind-saving thought. He laughed foolishly through his sobs.\n\n\"And you said he'd die horribly, Mac, a horrible death.\" His head\ndropped upon his arms, unconscious--and safe--with the rest of\nhumanity.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nThe Corpse on the Grating\n\n_By Hugh B. Cave_\n\n\n    In the gloomy depths of the old warehouse Dale saw a thing that\n    drew a scream of horror to his dry lips. It was a corpse--the\n    mold of decay on its long-dead features--and yet it was alive!\n\n[Illustration: _It was a corpse, standing before me like some propped-up\nthing from the grave._]\n\n\nIt was ten o'clock on the morning of December 5 when M. S. and I left\nthe study of Professor Daimler. You are perhaps acquainted with M. S.\nHis name appears constantly in the pages of the Illustrated News, in\nconjunction with some very technical article on psycho-analysis or with\nsome extensive study of the human brain and its functions. He is a\npsycho-fanatic, more or less, and has spent an entire lifetime of some\nseventy-odd years in pulling apart human skulls for the purpose of\ninvestigation. Lovely pursuit!\n\nFor some twenty years I have mocked him, in a friendly, half-hearted\nfashion. I am a medical man, and my own profession is one that does not\nsympathize with radicals.\n\nAs for Professor Daimler, the third member of our triangle--perhaps, if\nI take a moment to outline the events of that evening, the Professor's\npart in what follows will be less obscure. We had called on him, M. S.\nand I, at his urgent request. His rooms were in a narrow, unlighted\nstreet just off the square, and Daimler himself opened the door to us. A\ntall, loosely built chap he was, standing in the doorway like a\nmotionless ape, arms half extended.\n\n\"I've summoned you, gentlemen,\" he said quietly, \"because you two, of\nall London, are the only persons who know the nature of my recent\nexperiments. I should like to acquaint you with the results!\"\n\nHe led the way to his study, then kicked the door shut with his foot,\nseizing my arm as he did so. Quietly he dragged me to the table that\nstood against the farther wall. In the same even, unemotional tone of a\nman completely sure of himself, he commanded me to inspect it.\n\nFor a moment, in the semi-gloom of the room, I saw nothing. At length,\nhowever, the contents of the table revealed themselves, and I\ndistinguished a motley collection of test tubes, each filled with some\nfluid. The tubes were attached to each other by some ingenious\narrangement of thistles, and at the end of the table, where a chance\nblow could not brush it aside, lay a tiny phial of the resulting serum.\nFrom the appearance of the table, Daimler had evidently drawn a certain\namount of gas from each of the smaller tubes, distilling them through\nacid into the minute phial at the end. Yet even now, as I stared down at\nthe fantastic paraphernalia before me, I could sense no conclusive\nreason for its existence.\n\nI turned to the Professor with a quiet stare of bewilderment. He smiled.\n\n\"The experiment is over,\" he said. \"As to its conclusion, you, Dale, as\na medical man, will be sceptical. And you\"--turning to M. S.--\"as a\nscientist you will be amazed. I, being neither physician nor scientist,\nam merely filled with wonder!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe stepped to a long, square table-like structure in the center of the\nroom. Standing over it, he glanced quizzically at M. S., then at me.\n\n\"For a period of two weeks,\" he went on, \"I have kept, on the table\nhere, the body of a man who has been dead more than a month. I have\ntried, gentlemen, with acid combinations of my own origination, to bring\nthat body back to life. And ... I have--failed!\n\n\"But,\" he added quickly, noting the smile that crept across my face,\n\"that failure was in itself worth more than the average scientist's\ngreatest achievement! You know, Dale, that heat, if a man is not truly\ndead, will sometimes resurrect him. In a case of epilepsy, for instance,\nvictims have been pronounced dead only to return to life--sometimes in\nthe grave.\n\n\"I say 'if a man be not truly dead.' But what if that man _is_ truly\ndead? Does the cure alter itself in any manner? The motor of your car\ndies--do you bury it? You do not; you locate the faulty part, correct\nit, and infuse new life. And so, gentlemen, after remedying the ruptured\nheart of this dead man, by operation, I proceeded to bring him back to\nlife.\n\n\"I used heat. Terrific heat will sometimes originate a spark of new life\nin something long dead. Gentlemen, on the fourth day of my tests,\nfollowing a continued application of electric and acid heat, the\npatient--\"\n\nDaimler leaned over the table and took up a cigarette. Lighting it, he\ndropped the match and resumed his monologue.\n\n\"The patient turned suddenly over and drew his arm weakly across his\neyes. I rushed to his side. When I reached him, the body was once again\nstiff and lifeless. And--it has remained so.\"\n\nThe Professor stared at us quietly, waiting for comment. I answered him,\nas carelessly as I could, with a shrug of my shoulders.\n\n\"Professor, have you ever played with the dead body of a frog?\" I said\nsoftly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe shook his head silently.\n\n\"You would find it interesting sport,\" I told him. \"Take a common dry\ncell battery with enough voltage to render a sharp shock. Then apply\nyour wires to various parts of the frog's anatomy. If you are lucky, and\nstrike the right set of muscles, you will have the pleasure of seeing a\ndead frog leap suddenly forward. Understand, he will not regain life.\nYou have merely released his dead muscles by shock, and sent him\nbolting.\"\n\nThe Professor did not reply. I could feel his eyes on me, and had I\nturned, I should probably had found M. S. glaring at me in honest hate.\nThese men were students of mesmerism, of spiritualism, and my\ncommonplace contradiction was not over welcome.\n\n\"You are cynical, Dale,\" said M. S. coldly, \"because you do not\nunderstand!\"\n\n\"Understand? I am a doctor--not a ghost!\"\n\nBut M. S. had turned eagerly to the Professor.\n\n\"Where is this body--this experiment?\" he demanded.\n\nDaimler shook his head. Evidently he had acknowledged failure and did\nnot intend to drag his dead man before our eyes, unless he could bring\nthat man forth alive, upright, and ready to join our conversation!\n\n\"I've put it away,\" he said distantly. \"There is nothing more to be\ndone, now that our reverend doctor has insisted in making a matter of\nfact thing out of our experiment. You understand, I had not intended to\ngo in for wholesale resurrection, even if I had met with success. It was\nmy belief that a dead body, like a dead piece of mechanism, can be\nbrought to life again, provided we are intelligent enough to discover\nthe secret. And by God, it is _still_ my belief!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat was the situation, then, when M. S. and I paced slowly back along\nthe narrow street that contained the Professor's dwelling-place. My\ncompanion was strangely silent. More than once I felt his eyes upon me\nin an uncomfortable stare, yet he said nothing. Nothing, that is, until\nI had opened the conversation with some casual remark about the lunacy\nof the man we had just left.\n\n\"You are wrong in mocking him, Dale,\" M. S. replied bitterly. \"Daimler\nis a man of science. He is no child, experimenting with a toy; he is a\ngrown man who has the courage to believe in his powers. One of these\ndays....\"\n\nHe had intended to say that some day I should respect the Professor's\nefforts. One of these days! The interval of time was far shorter than\nanything so indefinite. The first event, with its succeeding series of\nhorrors, came within the next three minutes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe had reached a more deserted section of the square, a black,\nuninhabited street extending like a shadowed band of darkness between\ngaunt, high walls. I had noticed for some time that the stone structure\nbeside us seemed to be unbroken by door or window--that it appeared to\nbe a single gigantic building, black and forbidding. I mentioned the\nfact to M. S.\n\n\"The warehouse,\" he said simply. \"A lonely, God-forsaken place. We shall\nprobably see the flicker of the watchman's light in one of the upper\nchinks.\"\n\nAt his words, I glanced up. True enough, the higher part of the grim\nstructure was punctured by narrow, barred openings. Safety vaults,\nprobably. But the light, unless its tiny gleam was somewhere in the\ninner recesses of the warehouse, was dead. The great building was like\nan immense burial vault, a tomb--silent and lifeless.\n\nWe had reached the most forbidding section of the narrow street, where a\nsingle arch-lamp overhead cast a halo of ghastly yellow light over the\npavement. At the very rim of the circle of illumination, where the\nshadows were deeper and more silent, I could make out the black\nmouldings of a heavy iron grating. The bars of metal were designed, I\nbelieve, to seal the side entrance of the great warehouse from night\nmarauders. It was bolted in place and secured with a set of immense\nchains, immovable.\n\nThis much I saw as my intent gaze swept the wall before me. This huge\ntomb of silence held for me a peculiar fascination, and as I paced along\nbeside my gloomy companion, I stared directly ahead of me into the\ndarkness of the street. I wish to God my eyes had been closed or\nblinded!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was hanging on the grating. Hanging there, with white, twisted hands\nclutching the rigid bars of iron, straining to force them apart. His\nwhole distorted body was forced against the barrier, like the form of a\nmadman struggling to escape from his cage. His face--the image of it\nstill haunts me whenever I see iron bars in the darkness of a\npassage--was the face of a man who has died from utter, stark horror. It\nwas frozen in a silent shriek of agony, staring out at me with fiendish\nmaliciousness. Lips twisted apart. White teeth gleaming in the light.\nBloody eyes, with a horrible glare of colorless pigment. And--_dead_.\n\nI believe M. S. saw him at the very instant I recoiled. I felt a sudden\ngrip on my arm; and then, as an exclamation came harshly from my\ncompanion's lips, I was pulled forward roughly. I found myself staring\nstraight into the dead eyes of that fearful thing before me, found\nmyself standing rigid, motionless, before the corpse that hung within\nreach of my arm.\n\nAnd then, through that overwhelming sense of the horrible, came the\nquiet voice of my comrade--the voice of a man who looks upon death as\nnothing more than an opportunity for research.\n\n\"The fellow has been frightened to death, Dale. Frightened most\nhorribly. Note the expression of his mouth, the evident struggle to\nforce these bars apart and escape. Something has driven fear to his\nsoul, killed him.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI remember the words vaguely. When M. S. had finished speaking, I did\nnot reply. Not until he had stepped forward and bent over the distorted\nface of the thing before me, did I attempt to speak. When I did, my\nthoughts were a jargon.\n\n\"What, in God's name,\" I cried, \"could have brought such horror to a\nstrong man? What--\"\n\n\"Loneliness, perhaps,\" suggested M. S. with a smile. \"The fellow is\nevidently the watchman. He is alone, in a huge, deserted pit of\ndarkness, for hours at a time. His light is merely a ghostly ray of\nillumination, hardly enough to do more than increase the darkness. I\nhave heard of such cases before.\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders. Even as he spoke, I sensed the evasion in his\nwords. When I replied, he hardly heard my answer, for he had suddenly\nstepped forward, where he could look directly into those fear twisted\neyes.\n\n\"Dale,\" he said at length, turning slowly to face me, \"you ask for an\nexplanation of this horror? There _is_ an explanation. It is written\nwith an almost fearful clearness on this fellow's mind. Yet if I tell\nyou, you will return to your old skepticism--your damnable habit of\ndisbelief!\"\n\nI looked at him quietly. I had heard M. S. claim, at other times, that\nhe could read the thoughts of a dead man by the mental image that lay on\nthat man's brain. I had laughed at him. Evidently, in the present\nmoment, he recalled those laughs. Nevertheless, he faced me seriously.\n\n\"I can see two things, Dale,\" he said deliberately. \"One of them is a\ndark, narrow room--a room piled with indistinct boxes and crates, and\nwith an open door bearing the black number 4167. And in that open\ndoorway, coming forward with slow steps--alive, with arms extended and a\nfrightful face of passion--is a decayed human form. A corpse, Dale. A\nman who has been dead for many days, and is now--_alive_!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nM. S. turned slowly and pointed with upraised hand to the corpse on the\ngrating.\n\n\"That is why,\" he said simply, \"this fellow died from horror.\"\n\nHis words died into emptiness. For a moment I stared at him. Then, in\nspite of our surroundings, in spite of the late hour, the loneliness of\nthe street, the awful thing beside us, I laughed.\n\nHe turned upon me with a snarl. For the first time in my life I saw M.\nS. convulsed with rage. His old, lined face had suddenly become savage\nwith intensity.\n\n\"You laugh at me, Dale,\" he thundered. \"By God, you make a mockery out\nof a science that I have spent more than my life in studying! You call\nyourself a medical man--and you are not fit to carry the name! I will\nwager you, man, that your laughter is not backed by courage!\"\n\nI fell away from him. Had I stood within reach, I am sure he would have\nstruck me. Struck me! And I have been nearer to M. S. for the past ten\nyears than any man in London. And as I retreated from his temper, he\nreached forward to seize my arm. I could not help but feel impressed at\nhis grim intentness.\n\n\"Look here, Dale,\" he said bitterly, \"I will wager you a hundred pounds\nthat you will not spend the remainder of this night in the warehouse\nabove you! I will wager a hundred pounds against your own courage that\nyou will not back your laughter by going through what this fellow has\ngone through. That you will not prowl through the corridors of this\ngreat structure until you have found room 4167--_and remain in that room\nuntil dawn_!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was no choice. I glanced at the dead man, at the face of fear and\nthe clutching, twisted hands, and a cold dread filled me. But to refuse\nmy friend's wager would have been to brand myself an empty coward. I had\nmocked him. Now, whatever the cost, I must stand ready to pay for that\nmockery.\n\n\"Room 4167?\" I replied quietly, in a voice which I made every effort to\ncontrol, lest he should discover the tremor in it. \"Very well, I will do\nit!\"\n\nIt was nearly midnight when I found myself alone, climbing a musty,\nwinding ramp between the first and second floors of the deserted\nbuilding. Not a sound, except the sharp intake of my breath and the\ndismal creak of the wooden stairs, echoed through that tomb of death.\nThere was no light, not even the usual dim glow that is left to\nilluminate an unused corridor. Moreover, I had brought no means of light\nwith me--nothing but a half empty box of safety matches which, by some\nunholy premonition, I had forced myself to save for some future moment.\nThe stairs were black and difficult, and I mounted them slowly, groping\nwith both hands along the rough wall.\n\nI had left M. S. some few moments before. In his usual decisive manner\nhe had helped me to climb the iron grating and lower myself to the\nsealed alley-way on the farther side. Then, leaving him without a word,\nfor I was bitter against the triumphant tone of his parting words, I\nproceeded into the darkness, fumbling forward until I had discovered the\nopen door in the lower part of the warehouse.\n\nAnd then the ramp, winding crazily upward--upward--upward, seemingly\nwithout end. I was seeking blindly for that particular room which was to\nbe my destination. Room 4167, with its high number, could hardly be on\nthe lower floors, and so I had stumbled upward....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was at the entrance of the second floor corridor that I struck the\nfirst of my desultory supply of matches, and by its light discovered a\nplacard nailed to the wall. The thing was yellow with age and hardly\nlegible. In the drab light of the match I had difficulty in reading\nit--but, as far as I can remember, the notice went something like this:\n\n    WAREHOUSE RULES\n\n    1. No light shall be permitted in any room or corridor, as a\n    prevention against fire.\n\n    2. No person shall be admitted to rooms or corridors unless\n    accompanied by an employee.\n\n    3. A watchman shall be on the premises from 7 P.M. until 6 A.M.\n    He shall make the round of the corridors every hour during that\n    interval, at a quarter past the hour.\n\n    4. Rooms are located by their numbers: the first figure in the\n    room number indicating its floor location.\n\nI could read no further. The match in my fingers burned to a black\nthread and dropped. Then, with the burnt stump still in my hand, I\ngroped through the darkness to the bottom of the second ramp.\n\nRoom 4167, then, was on the fourth floor--the topmost floor of the\nstructure. I must confess that the knowledge did not bring any renewed\nburst of courage! The top floor! Three black stair-pits would lie\nbetween me and the safety of escape. There would be no escape! No human\nbeing in the throes of fear could hope to discover that tortured outlet,\ncould hope to grope his way through Stygian gloom down a triple ramp of\nblack stairs. And even though he succeeded in reaching the lower\ncorridors, there was still a blind alley-way, sealed at the outer end by\na high grating of iron bars....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEscape! The mockery of it caused me to stop suddenly in my ascent and\nstand rigid, my whole body trembling violently.\n\nBut outside, in the gloom of the street, M. S. was waiting, waiting with\nthat fiendish glare of triumph that would brand me a man without\ncourage. I could not return to face him, not though all the horrors of\nhell inhabited this gruesome place of mystery. And horrors must surely\ninhabit it, else how could one account for that fearful thing on the\ngrating below? But I had been through horror before. I had seen a man,\nsupposedly dead on the operating table, jerk suddenly to his feet and\nscream. I had seen a young girl, not long before, awake in the midst of\nan operation, with the knife already in her frail body. Surely, after\nthose definite horrors, no _unknown_ danger would send me cringing back\nto the man who was waiting so bitterly for me to return.\n\nThose were the thoughts pregnant in my mind as I groped slowly,\ncautiously along the corridor of the upper floor, searching each closed\ndoor for the indistinct number 4167. The place was like the center of a\nhuge labyrinth, a spider-web of black, repelling passages, leading into\nsome central chamber of utter silence and blackness. I went forward with\ndragging steps, fighting back the dread that gripped me as I went\nfarther and farther from the outlet of escape. And then, after losing\nmyself completely in the gloom, I threw aside all thoughts of return and\npushed on with a careless, surface bravado, and laughed aloud.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo, at length, I reached that room of horror, secreted high in the\ndeeper recesses of the deserted warehouse. The number--God grant I never\nsee it again!--was scrawled in black chalk on the door--4167. I pushed\nthe half-open barrier wide, and entered.\n\nIt was a small room, even as M. S. had forewarned me--or as the dead\nmind of that thing on the grate had forewarned M. S. The glow of my\nout-thrust match revealed a great stack of dusty boxes and crates, piled\nagainst the farther wall. Revealed, too, the black corridor beyond the\nentrance, and a small, upright table before me.\n\nIt was the table, and the stool beside it, that drew my attention and\nbrought a muffled exclamation from my lips. The thing had been thrust\nout of its usual place, pushed aside as if some frenzied shape had\nlunged against it. I could make out its former position by the marks on\nthe dusty floor at my feet. Now it was nearer to the center of the room,\nand had been wrenched sidewise from its holdings. A shudder took hold of\nme as I looked at it. A living person, sitting on the stool before me,\nstaring at the door, would have wrenched the table in just this manner\nin his frenzy to escape from the room!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe light of the match died, plunging me into a pit of gloom. I struck\nanother and stepped closer to the table. And there, on the floor, I\nfound two more things that brought fear to my soul. One of them was a\nheavy flash-lamp--a watchman's lamp--where it had evidently been\ndropped. Been dropped in flight! But what awful terror must have gripped\nthe fellow to make him forsake his only means of escape through those\nblack passages? And the second thing--a worn copy of a leather-bound\nbook, flung open on the boards below the stool!\n\nThe flash-lamp, thank God! had not been shattered. I switched it on,\ndirecting its white circle of light over the room. This time, in the\nvivid glare, the room became even more unreal. Black walls, clumsy,\ndistorted shadows on the wall, thrown by those huge piles of wooden\nboxes. Shadows that were like crouching men, groping toward me. And\nbeyond, where the single door opened into a passage of Stygian darkness,\nthat yawning entrance was thrown into hideous detail. Had any upright\nfigure been standing there, the light would have made an unholy\nphosphorescent specter out of it.\n\nI summoned enough courage to cross the room and pull the door shut.\nThere was no way of locking it. Had I been able to fasten it, I should\nsurely have done so; but the room was evidently an unused chamber,\nfilled with empty refuse. This was the reason, probably, why the\nwatchman had made use of it as a retreat during the intervals between\nhis rounds.\n\nBut I had no desire to ponder over the sordidness of my surroundings. I\nreturned to my stool in silence, and stooping, picked up the fallen book\nfrom the floor. Carefully I placed the lamp on the table, where its\nlight would shine on the open page. Then, turning the cover, I began to\nglance through the thing which the man before me had evidently been\nstudying.\n\nAnd before I had read two lines, the explanation of the whole horrible\nthing struck me. I stared dumbly down at the little book and laughed.\nLaughed harshly, so that the sound of my mad cackle echoed in a thousand\nghastly reverberations through the dead corridors of the building.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a book of horror, of fantasy. A collection of weird, terrifying,\nsupernatural tales with grotesque illustrations in funereal black and\nwhite. And the very line I had turned to, the line which had probably\nstruck terror to that unlucky devil's soul, explained M. S.'s \"decayed\nhuman form, standing in the doorway with arms extended and a frightful\nface of passion!\" The description--the same description--lay before me,\nalmost in my friend's words. Little wonder that the fellow on the\ngrating below, after reading this orgy of horror, had suddenly gone mad\nwith fright. Little wonder that the picture engraved on his dead mind\nwas a picture of a corpse standing in the doorway of room 4167!\n\nI glanced at that doorway and laughed. No doubt of it, it was that awful\ndescription in M. S.'s untempered language that had made me dread my\nsurroundings, not the loneliness and silence of the corridors about me.\nNow, as I stared at the room, the closed door, the shadows on the wall,\nI could not repress a grin.\n\nBut the grin was not long in duration. A six-hour siege awaited me\nbefore I could hear the sound of human voice again--six hours of\nsilence and gloom. I did not relish it. Thank God the fellow before me\nhad had foresight enough to leave his book of fantasy for my amusement!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI turned to the beginning of the story. A lovely beginning it was,\noutlining in some detail how a certain Jack Fulton, English adventurer,\nhad suddenly found himself imprisoned (by a mysterious black gang of\nmonks, or something of the sort) in a forgotten cell at the monastery of\nEl Toro. The cell, according to the pages before me, was located in the\n\"empty, haunted pits below the stone floors of the structure....\" Lovely\nsetting! And the brave Fulton had been secured firmly to a huge metal\nring set in the farther wall, opposite the entrance.\n\nI read the description twice. At the end of it I could not help but lift\nmy head to stare at my own surroundings. Except for the location of the\ncell, I might have been in they same setting. The same darkness, same\nsilence, same loneliness. Peculiar similarity!\n\nAnd then: \"Fulton lay quietly, without attempt to struggle. In the dark,\nthe stillness of the vaults became unbearable, terrifying. Not a\nsuggestion of sound, except the scraping of unseen rats--\"\n\nI dropped the book with a start. From the opposite end of the room in\nwhich I sat came a half inaudible scuffling noise--the sound of hidden\nrodents scrambling through the great pile of boxes. Imagination? I am\nnot sure. At the moment, I would have sworn that the sound was a\ndefinite one, that I had heard it distinctly. Now, as I recount this\ntale of horror, I am not sure.\n\nBut I am sure of this: There was no smile on my lips as I picked up the\nbook again with trembling fingers and continued.\n\n\"The sound died into silence. For an eternity, the prisoner lay rigid,\nstaring at the open door of his cell. The opening was black, deserted,\nlike the mouth of a deep tunnel, leading to hell. And then, suddenly,\nfrom the gloom beyond that opening, came an almost noiseless, padded\nfootfall!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis time there was no doubt of it. The book fell from my fingers,\ndropped to the floor with a clatter. Yet even through the sound of its\nfalling, I heard that fearful sound--the shuffle of a living foot! I sat\nmotionless, staring with bloodless face at the door of room 4167. And as\nI stared, the sound came again, and again--_the slow tread of dragging\nfootsteps, approaching along the black corridor without_!\n\nI got to my feet like an automaton, swaying heavily. Every drop of\ncourage ebbed from my soul as I stood there, one hand clutching the\ntable, waiting....\n\nAnd then, with an effort, I moved forward. My hand was outstretched to\ngrasp the wooden handle of the door. And--I did not have the courage.\nLike a cowed beast I crept back to my place and slumped down on the\nstool, my eyes still transfixed in a mute stare of terror.\n\nI waited. For more than half an hour I waited, motionless. Not a sound\nstirred in the passage beyond that closed barrier. Not a suggestion of\nany living presence came to me. Then, leaning back against the wall with\na harsh laugh, I wiped away the cold moisture that had trickled over my\nforehead into my eyes.\n\nIt was another five minutes before I picked up the book again. You call\nme a fool for continuing it? A fool? I tell you, even a story of horror\nis more comfort than a room of grotesque shadows and silence. Even a\nprinted page is better than grim reality!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd so I read on. The story was one of suspense, madness. For the next\ntwo pages I read a cunning description of the prisoner's mental\nreaction. Strangely enough, it conformed precisely with my own.\n\n\"Fulton's head had fallen to his chest,\" the script read. \"For an\nendless while he did not stir, did not dare to lift his eyes. And then,\nafter more than an hour of silent agony and suspense, the boy's head\ncame up mechanically. Came up--and suddenly jerked rigid. A horrible\nscream burst from his dry lips as he stared--stared like a dead man--at\nthe black entrance to his cell. There, standing without motion in the\nopening, stood a shrouded figure of death. Empty eyes, glaring with\nawful hate, bored into his own. Great arms, bony and rotten, extended\ntoward him. Decayed flesh--\"\n\nI read no more. Even as I lunged to my feet, with that mad book still\ngripped in my hand, I heard the door of my room grind open. I screamed,\nscreamed in utter horror at the thing I saw there. Dead? Good God, I do\nnot know. It was a corpse, a dead human body, standing before me like\nsome propped-up thing from the grave. A face half eaten away, terrible\nin its leering grin. Twisted mouth, with only a suggestion of lips,\ncurled back over broken teeth. Hair--writhing, distorted--like a mass of\nmoving, bloody coils. And its arms, ghastly white, bloodless, were\nextended toward me, with open, clutching hands.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was alive! Alive! Even while I stood there, crouching against the\nwall, it stepped forward toward me. I saw a heavy shudder pass over it,\nand the sound of its scraping feet burned its way into my soul. And\nthen, with its second step, the fearful thing stumbled to its knees. The\nwhite, gleaming arms, thrown into streaks of living fire by the light of\nmy lamp, flung violently upwards, twisting toward the ceiling. I saw the\ngrin change to an expression of agony, of torment. And then the thing\ncrashed upon me--dead.\n\nWith a great cry of fear I stumbled to the door. I groped out of that\nroom of horror, stumbled along the corridor. No light. I left it behind,\non the table, to throw a circle of white glare over the decayed,\nliving-dead intruder who had driven me mad.\n\nMy return down those winding ramps to the lower floor was a nightmare of\nfear. I remember that I stumbled, that I plunged through the darkness\nlike a man gone mad. I had no thought of caution, no thought of anything\nexcept escape.\n\nAnd then the lower door, and the alley of gloom. I reached the grating,\nflung myself upon it and pressed my face against the bars in a futile\neffort to escape. The same--as the fear-tortured man--who had--come\nbefore--me.\n\nI felt strong hands lifting me up. A dash of cool air, and then the\nrefreshing patter of falling rain.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was the afternoon of the following day, December 6, when M. S. sat\nacross the table from me in my own study. I had made a rather hesitant\nattempt to tell him, without dramatics and without dwelling on my own\nlack of courage, of the events of the previous night.\n\n\"You deserved it, Dale,\" he said quietly. \"You are a medical man,\nnothing more, and yet you mock the beliefs of a scientist as great as\nDaimler. I wonder--do you still mock the Professor's beliefs?\"\n\n\"That he can bring a dead man to life?\" I smiled, a bit doubtfully.\n\n\"I will tell you something, Dale,\" said M. S. deliberately. He was\nleaning across the table, staring at me. \"The Professor made only one\nmistake in his great experiment. He did not wait long enough for the\neffect of his strange acids to work. He acknowledged failure too soon,\nand got rid of the body.\" He paused.\n\n\"When the Professor stored his patient away, Dale,\" he said quietly, \"he\nstored it in room 4170, at the great warehouse. If you are acquainted\nwith the place, you will know that room 4170 is directly across the\ncorridor from 4167.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nCreatures of the Light\n\n_By Sophie Wenzel Ellis_\n\n\n    He had striven to perfect the faultless man of the future, and\n    had succeeded--too well. For in the pitilessly cold eyes of\n    Adam, his super-human creation, Dr. Mundson saw only\n    contempt--and annihilation--for the human race.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nIn a night club of many lights and much high-pitched laughter, where he\nhad come for an hour of forgetfulness and an execrable dinner, John\nNorthwood was suddenly conscious that Fate had begun shuffling the cards\nof his destiny for a dramatic game.\n\nFirst, he was aware that the singularly ugly and deformed man at the\nnext table was gazing at him with an intense, almost excited scrutiny.\nBut, more disturbing than this, was the scowl of hate on the face of\nanother man, as handsome as this other was hideous, who sat in a far\ncorner hidden behind a broad column, with rude elbows on the table,\ngawking first at Northwood and then at the deformed, almost hideous\nman.\n\n[Illustration: _The projector, belching forth its stinking breath of\ncorruption, swung in a mad arc over the ceiling, over the walls._]\n\nNorthwood's blood chilled over the expression on the handsome,\nfair-haired stranger's perfectly carved face. If a figure in marble\ncould display a fierce, unnatural passion, it would seem no more\neldritch than the hate in the icy blue eyes.\n\nIt was not a new experience for Northwood to be stared at: he was not\nmerely a good-looking young fellow of twenty-five, he was scenery,\nmagnificent and compelling. Furthermore, he had been in the public eye\nfor years, first as a precocious child and, later, as a brilliant young\nscientist. Yet, for all his experience with hero worshippers to put an\nadamantine crust on his sensibilities, he grew warm-eared under the gaze\nof these two strangers--this hunchback with a face like a grotesque mask\nin a Greek play, this other who, even handsomer than himself, chilled\nthe blood queerly with the cold perfection of his godlike masculine\nbeauty.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNorthwood sensed something familiar about the hunchback. Somewhere he\nhad seen that huge, round, intelligent face splattered with startling\nfeatures. The very breadth of the man's massive brow was not altogether\nunknown to him, nor could Northwood look into the mournful, near-sighted\nblack eyes without trying to recall when and where he had last seen\nthem.\n\nBut this other of the marble-perfect nose and jaw, the blond,\nthick-waved hair, was totally a stranger, whom Northwood fervently hoped\nhe would never know too well.\n\nTrying to analyze the queer repugnance that he felt for this handsome,\nboldly staring fellow, Northwood decided: \"He's like a newly-made wax\nfigure endowed with life.\"\n\nShivering over his own fantastic thought, he again glanced swiftly at\nthe hunchback, who he noticed was playing with his coffee, evidently to\nprolong the meal.\n\nOne year of calm-headed scientific teaching in a famous old eastern\nuniversity had not made him callous to mysteries. Thus, with a feeling\nof high adventure, he finished his supper and prepared to go. From the\ncorner of his eye, he saw the hunchback leave his seat, while the\nhandsome man behind the column rose furtively, as though he, too,\nintended to follow.\n\nNorthwood was out in the dusky street about thirty seconds, when the\nhunchback came from the foyer. Without apparently noticing Northwood, he\nhailed a taxi. For a moment, he stood still, waiting for the taxi to\npull up at the curb. Standing thus, with the street light limning every\nunnatural angle of his twisted body and every queer abnormality of his\nhuge features, he looked almost repulsive.\n\nOn his way to the taxi, his thick shoulder jostled the younger man.\nNorthwood felt something strike his foot, and, stooping in the crowded\nstreet, picked up a black leather wallet.\n\n\"Wait!\" he shouted as the hunchback stepped into the waiting taxi.\n\nBut the man did not falter. In a moment, Northwood lost sight of him as\nthe taxi moved away.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe debated with himself whether or not he should attempt to follow. And\nwhile he stood thus in indecision, the handsome stranger approached him.\n\n\"Good evening to you,\" he said curtly. His rich, musical voice, for all\nits deepness, held a faint hint of the tremulous, birdlike notes heard\nin the voice of a young child who has not used his vocal chords long\nenough for them to have lost their exquisite newness.\n\n\"Good evening,\" echoed Northwood, somewhat uncertainly. A sudden aura of\nrepulsion swept coldly over him. Seen close, with the brilliant light of\nthe street directly on his too perfect face, the man was more sinister\nthan in the caf\u00e9. Yet Northwood, struggling desperately for a reason to\nexplain his violent dislike, could not discover why he shrank from this\nsplendid creature, whose eyes and flesh had a new, fresh appearance\nrarely seen except in very young boys.\n\n\"I want what you picked up,\" went on the stranger.\n\n\"It isn't yours!\" Northwood flashed back. Ah! that effluvium of hatred\nwhich seemed to weave a tangible net around him!\n\n\"Nor is it yours. Give it to me!\"\n\n\"You're insolent, aren't you?\"\n\n\"If you don't give it to me, you will be sorry.\" The man did not raise\nhis voice in anger, yet the words whipped Northwood with almost physical\nviolence. \"If he knew that I saw everything that happened in there--that\nI am talking to you at this moment--he would tremble with fear.\"\n\n\"But you can't intimidate me.\"\n\n\"No?\" For a long moment, the cold blue eyes held his contemptuously.\n\"No? I can't frighten you--you worm of the Black Age?\"\n\nBefore Northwood's horrified sight, he vanished; vanished as though he\nhad turned suddenly to air and floated away.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe street was not crowded at that time, and there was no pressing group\nof bodies to hide the splendid creature. Northwood gawked stupidly,\nmouth half open, eyes searching wildly everywhere. The man was gone. He\nhad simply disappeared, in this sane, electric-lighted street.\n\nSuddenly, close to Northwood's ear, grated a derisive laugh. \"I can't\nfrighten you?\" From nowhere came that singularly young-old voice.\n\nAs Northwood jerked his head around to meet blank space, a blow struck\nthe corner of his mouth. He felt the warm blood run over his chin.\n\n\"I could take that wallet from you, worm, but you may keep it, and see\nme later. But remember this--the thing inside never will be yours.\"\n\nThe words fell from empty air.\n\nFor several minutes, Northwood waited at the spot, expecting another\ndemonstration of the abnormal, but nothing else occurred. At last,\ntrembling violently, he wiped the thick moisture from his forehead and\ndabbed at the blood which he still felt on his chin.\n\nBut when he looked at his handkerchief, he muttered:\n\n\"Well, I'll be jiggered!\"\n\nThe handkerchief bore not the slightest trace of blood.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnder the light in his bedroom, Northwood examined the wallet. It was\nmade of alligator skin, clasped with a gold signet that bore the initial\nM. The first pocket was empty; the second yielded an object that sent a\nwarm flush to his face.\n\nIt was the photograph of a gloriously beautiful girl, so seductively\nlovely that the picture seemed almost to be alive. The short, curved\nupper lip, the full, delicately voluptuous lower, parted slightly in a\nsmile that seemed to linger in every exquisite line of her face. She\nlooked as though she had just spoken passionately, and the spirit of her\nwords had inspired her sweet flesh and eyes.\n\nNorthwood turned his head abruptly and groaned, \"Good Heavens!\"\n\nHe had no right to palpitate over the picture of an unknown beauty. Only\na month ago, he had become engaged to a young woman whose mind was as\nbrilliant as her face was plain. Always he had vowed that he would never\nmarry a pretty girl, for he detested his own masculine beauty sincerely.\n\nHe tried to grasp a mental picture of Mary Burns, who had never stirred\nin him the emotion that this smiling picture invoked. But, gazing at the\npicture, he could not remember how his fianc\u00e9e looked.\n\nSuddenly the picture fell from his fingers and dropped to the floor on\nits face, revealing an inscription on the back. In a bold, masculine\nhand, he read: \"Your future wife.\"\n\n\"Some lucky fellow is headed for a life of bliss,\" was his jealous\nthought.\n\nHe frowned at the beautiful face. What was this girl to that hideous\nhunchback? Why did the handsome stranger warn him, \"_The thing inside\nnever will be yours_?\"\n\nAgain he turned eagerly to the wallet.\n\nIn the last flap he found something that gave him another surprise: a\nplain white card on which a name and address were written by the same\nhand that had penned the inscription on the picture.\n\n  Emil Mundson, Ph. D.,\n  44-1/2 Indian Court\n\nEmil Mundson, the electrical wizard and distinguished scientific writer,\nfriend of the professor of science at the university where Northwood was\nan assistant professor; Emil Mundson, whom, a week ago, Northwood had\nyearned mightily to meet.\n\nNow Northwood knew why the hunchback's intelligent, ugly face was\nfamiliar to him. He had seen it pictured as often as enterprising news\nphotographers could steal a likeness from the over-sensitive scientist,\nwho would never sit for a formal portrait.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEven before Northwood had graduated from the university where he now\ntaught, he had been avidly interested in Emil Mundson's fantastic\narticles in scientific journals. Only a week ago, Professor Michael had\ncome to him with the current issue of New Science, shouting excitedly:\n\n\"Did you read this, John, this article by Emil Mundson?\" His shaking,\ngnarled old fingers tapped the open magazine.\n\nNorthwood seized the magazine and looked avidly at the title of the\narticle, \"Creatures of the Light.\"\n\n\"No, I haven't read it,\" he admitted. \"My magazine hasn't come yet.\"\n\n\"Run through it now briefly, will you? And note with especial care the\npassages I have marked. In fact, you needn't bother with anything else\njust now. Read this--and this--and this.\" He pointed out penciled\nparagraphs.\n\nNorthwood read:\n\n    Man always has been, always will be a creature of the light. He\n    is forever reaching for some future point of perfected evolution\n    which, even when his most remote ancestor was a fish creature\n    composed of a few cells, was the guiding power that brought him\n    up from the first stinking sea and caused him to create gods in\n    his own image.\n\n    It is this yearning for perfection which sets man apart from all\n    other life, which made him _man_ even in the rudimentary stages\n    of his development. He was man when he wallowed in the slime of\n    the new world and yearned for the air above. He will still be\n    man when he has evolved into that glorious creature of the\n    future whose body is deathless and whose mind rules the\n    universe.\n\nProfessor Michael, looking over Northwood's shoulder, interrupted the\nreading:\n\n\"_Man always has been man_,\" he droned emphatically. \"That's not\noriginal with friend Mundson, of course; yet it is a theory that has not\nreceived sufficient investigation.\" He indicated another marked\nparagraph. \"Read this thoughtfully, John. It's the crux of Mundson's\nthought.\"\n\nNorthwood continued:\n\n    Since the human body is chemical and electrical, increased\n    knowledge of its powers and limitations will enable us to work\n    with Nature in her sublime but infinitely slow processes of\n    human evolution. We need not wait another fifty thousand years\n    to be godlike creatures. Perhaps even now we may be standing at\n    the beginning of the splendid bridge that will take us to that\n    state of perfected evolution when we shall be Creatures who have\n    reached the Light.\n\nNorthwood looked questioningly at the professor. \"Queer, fantastic\nthing, isn't it?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nProfessor Michael smoothed his thin, gray hair with his dried-out hand.\n\"Fantastic?\" His intellectual eyes behind the thick glasses sought the\nceiling. \"Who can say? Haven't you ever wondered why all parents expect\ntheir children to be nearer perfection than themselves, and why is it a\nnatural impulse for them to be willing to sacrifice themselves to better\ntheir offspring?\" He paused and moistened his pale, wrinkled lips.\n\"Instinct, Northwood. We Creatures of the Light know that our race shall\nreach that point in evolution when, as perfect creatures, we shall rule\nall matter and live forever.\" He punctuated the last words with blows\non the table.\n\nNorthwood laughed dryly. \"How many thousands of years are you looking\nforward, Professor?\"\n\nThe professor made an obscure noise that sounded like a smothered sniff.\n\"You and I shall never agree on the point that mental advancement may\nwipe out physical limitations in the human race, perhaps in a few\nhundred years. It seems as though your profound admiration for Dr.\nMundson would win you over to this pet theory.\"\n\n\"But what sane man can believe that even perfectly developed beings,\nthrough mental control, could overcome Nature's fixed laws?\"\n\n\"We don't know! We don't know!\" The professor slapped the magazine with\nan emphatic hand. \"Emil Mundson hasn't written this article for nothing.\nHe's paving the way for some announcement that will startle the\nscientific world. I know him. In the same manner he gave out veiled\nhints of his various brilliant discoveries and inventions long before he\noffered them to the world.\"\n\n\"But Dr. Mundson is an electrical wizard. He would not be delving\nseriously into the mysteries of evolution, would he?\"\n\n\"Why not?\" The professor's wizened face screwed up wisely. \"A year ago,\nwhen he was back from one of those mysterious long excursions he takes\nin that weirdly different aircraft of his, about which he is so\nsecretive, he told me that he was conducting experiments to prove his\nbelief that the human brain generates electric current, and that the\nelectrical impulses in the brain set up radioactive waves that some day,\namong other miracles, will make thought communication possible. Perfect\nman, he says, will perform mental feats which will give him complete\nmental domination over the physical.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNorthwood finished reading and turned thoughtfully to the window. His\nprofile in repose had the straight-nosed, full-lipped perfection of a\nGreek coin. Old, wizened Professor Michael, gazing at him covertly,\nsmothered a sigh.\n\n\"I wish you knew Dr. Mundson,\" he said. \"He, the ugliest man in the\nworld, delights in physical perfection. He would revel in your splendid\nbody and brilliant mind.\"\n\nNorthwood blushed hotly. \"You'll have to arrange a meeting between us.\"\n\n\"I have.\" The professor's thin, dry lips pursed comically. \"He'll drop\nin to see you within a few days.\"\n\nAnd now John Northwood sat holding Dr. Mundson's card and the wallet\nwhich the scientist had so mysteriously dropped at his feet.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHere was high adventure, perhaps, for which he had been singled out by\nthe famous electrical wizard. While excitement mounted in his blood,\nNorthwood again examined the photograph. The girl's strange eyes, odd in\nexpression rather than in size or shape, seemed to hold him. The young\nman's breath came quicker.\n\n\"It's a challenge,\" he said softly. \"It won't hurt to see what it's all\nabout.\"\n\nHis watch showed eleven o'clock. He would return the wallet that night.\nInto his coat pocket he slipped a revolver. One sometimes needed weapons\nin Indian Court.\n\nHe took a taxi, which soon turned from the well-lighted streets into a\nsection where squalid houses crowded against each other, and dirty\nchildren swarmed in the streets in their last games of the day.\n\nIndian Court was little more than an alley, dark and evil smelling.\n\nThe chauffeur stopped at the entrance and said:\n\n\"If I drive in, I'll have to back out, sir. Number forty-four and a half\nis the end house, facing the entrance.\"\n\n\"You've been here before?\" asked Northwood.\n\n\"Last week I drove the queerest bird here--a fellow as good-looking as\nyou, who had me follow the taxi occupied by a hunchback with a face\nlike Old Nick.\" The man hesitated and went on haltingly: \"It might sound\ngoofy, mister, but there was something funny about my fare. He jumped\nout, asked me the charge, and, in the moment I glanced at my taxi-meter,\nhe disappeared. Yes, sir. Vanished, owing me four dollars, six bits. It\nwas almost ghostlike, mister.\"\n\nNorthwood laughed nervously and dismissed him. He found his number and\nknocked at the dilapidated door. He heard a sudden movement in the\nlighted room beyond, and the door opened quickly.\n\nDr. Mundson faced him.\n\n\"I knew you'd come!\" he said with a slight Teutonic accent. \"Often I'm\nnot wrong in sizing up my man. Come in.\"\n\nNorthwood cleared his throat awkwardly. \"You dropped your wallet at my\nfeet, Dr. Mundson. I tried to stop you before you got away, but I guess\nyou did not hear me.\"\n\nHe offered the wallet, but the hunchback waved it aside.\n\n\"A ruse, of course,\" he confessed. \"It just was my way of testing what\nyour Professor Michael told about you--that you are extraordinarily\nintelligent, virile, and imaginative. Had you sent the wallet to me, I\nshould have sought elsewhere for my man. Come in.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNorthwood followed him into a living room evidently recently furnished\nin a somewhat hurried manner. The furniture, although rich, was not\nplaced to best advantage. The new rug was a trifle crooked on the floor,\nand the lamp shades clashed in color with the other furnishings.\n\nDr. Mundson's intense eyes swept over Northwood's tall, slim body.\n\n\"Ah, you're a man!\" he said softly. \"You are what all men would be if we\nfollowed Nature's plan that only the fit shall survive. But modern\nscience is permitting the unfit to live and to mix their defective\nbeings with the developing race!\" His huge fist gesticulated madly.\n\"Fools! Fools! They need me and perfect men like you.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because you can help me in my plan to populate the earth with a new\nrace of godlike people. But don't question me too closely now. Even if I\nshould explain, you would call me insane. But watch; gradually I shall\nunfold the mystery before you, so that you will believe.\"\n\nHe reached for the wallet that Northwood still held, opened it with a\nmonstrous hand, and reached for the photograph. \"She shall bring you\nlove. She's more beautiful than a poet's dream.\"\n\nA warm flush crept over the young man's face.\n\n\"I can easily understand,\" he said, \"how a man could love her, but for\nme she comes too late.\"\n\n\"Pooh! Fiddlesticks!\" The scientist snapped his fingers. \"This girl was\ncreated for you. That other--you will forget her the moment you set eyes\non the sweet flesh of this Athalia. She is an houri from Paradise--a\nmaiden of musk and incense.\" He held the girl's photograph toward the\nyoung man. \"Keep it. She is yours, if you are strong enough to hold\nher.\"\n\nNorthwood opened his card case and placed the picture inside, facing\nMary's photograph. Again the warning words of the mysterious stranger\nrang in his memory: \"_The thing inside never will be yours._\"\n\n\"Where to,\" he said eagerly; \"and when do we start?\"\n\n\"To the new Garden of Eden,\" said the scientist, with such a beatific\nsmile that his face was less hideous. \"We start immediately. I have\narranged with Professor Michael for you to go.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNorthwood followed Dr. Mundson to the street and walked with him a few\nblocks to a garage where the scientist's motor car waited.\n\n\"The apartment in Indian Court is just a little eccentricity of mine,\"\nexplained Dr. Mundson. \"I need people in my work, people whom I must\nselect through swift, sure tests. The apartment comes in handy, as\nto-night.\"\n\nNorthwood scarcely noted where they were going, or how long they had\nbeen on the way. He was vaguely aware that they had left the city\nbehind, and were now passing through farms bathed in moonlight.\n\nAt last they entered a path that led through a bit of woodland. For half\na mile the path continued, and then ended at a small, enclosed field. In\nthe middle of this rested a queer aircraft. Northwood knew it was a\nflying machine only by the propellers mounted on the top of the huge\nball-shaped body. There were no wings, no birdlike hull, no tail.\n\n\"It looks almost like a little world ready to fly off into space,\" he\ncommented.\n\n\"It is just about that.\" The scientist's squat, bunched-out body,\nsettled squarely on long, thin, straddled legs, looked gnomelike in the\nmoonlight. \"One cannot copy flesh with steel and wood, but one can make\nmetal perform magic of which flesh is not capable. My sun-ship is not a\nmechanical reproduction of a bird. It is--but, climb in, young friend.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNorthwood followed Dr. Mundson into the aircraft. The moment the\nscientist closed the metal door behind them, Northwood was instantly\naware of some concealed horror that vibrated through his nerves. For one\ndreadful moment, he expected some terrific agent of the shadows that\nescaped the electric lights to leap upon him. And this was odd, for\nnothing could be saner than the globular interior of the aircraft,\ndivided into four wedge-shaped apartments.\n\nDr. Mundson also paused at the door, puzzled, hesitant.\n\n\"Someone has been here!\" he exclaimed. \"Look, Northwood! The bunk has\nbeen occupied--the one in this cabin I had set aside for you.\"\n\nHe pointed to the disarranged bunk, where the impression of a head could\nstill be seen on a pillow.\n\n\"A tramp, perhaps.\"\n\n\"No! The door was locked, and, as you saw, the fence around this field\nwas protected with barbed wire. There's something wrong. I felt it on my\ntrip here all the way, like someone watching me in the dark. And don't\nlaugh! I have stopped laughing at all things that seem unnatural. You\ndon't know what is natural.\"\n\nNorthwood shivered. \"Maybe someone is concealed about the ship.\"\n\n\"Impossible. Me, I thought so, too. But I looked and looked, and there\nwas nothing.\"\n\nAll evening Northwood had burned to tell the scientist about the\nhandsome stranger in the Mad Hatter Club. But even now he shrank from\nsaying that a man had vanished before his eyes.\n\nDr. Mundson was working with a succession of buttons and levers. There\nwas a slight jerk, and then the strange craft shot up, straight as a\nbullet from a gun, with scarcely a sound other than a continuous\nwhistle.\n\n\"The vertical rising aircraft perfected,\" explained Dr. Mundson. \"But\nwhat would you think if I told you that there is not an ounce of\ngasoline in my heavier-than-air craft?\"\n\n\"I shouldn't be surprised. An electrical genius would seek for a less\nobsolete source of power.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the bright flare of the electric lights, the scientist's ugly face\nflushed. \"The man who harnesses the sun rules the world. He can make the\ndesert places bloom, the frozen poles balmy and verdant. You, John\nNorthwood, are one of the very few to fly in a machine operated solely\nby electrical energy from the sun's rays.\"\n\n\"Are you telling me that this airship is operated with power from the\nsun?\"\n\n\"Yes. And I cannot take the credit for its invention.\" He sighed. \"The\ndream was mine, but a greater brain developed it--a brain that may be\ngreater than I suspect.\" His face grew suddenly graver.\n\nA little later Northwood said: \"It seems that we must be making fabulous\nspeed.\"\n\n\"Perhaps!\" Dr. Mundson worked with the controls. \"Here, I've cut her\ndown to the average speed of the ordinary airplane. Now you can see a\nbit of the night scenery.\"\n\nNorthwood peeped out the thick glass porthole. Far below, he saw two\ntiny streaks of light, one smooth and stationery, the other wavering as\nthough it were a reflection in water.\n\n\"That can't be a lighthouse!\" he cried.\n\nThe scientist glanced out. \"It is. We're approaching the Florida Keys.\"\n\n\"Impossible! We've been traveling less than an hour.\"\n\n\"But, my young friend, do you realize that my sun-ship has a speed of\nover one thousand miles an hour, how much over I dare not tell you?\"\n\nThroughout the night, Northwood sat beside Dr. Mundson, watching his\ndeft fingers control the simple-looking buttons and levers. So fast was\ntheir flight now that, through the portholes, sky and earth looked the\nsame: dark gray films of emptiness. The continuous weird whistle from\nthe hidden mechanism of the sun-ship was like the drone of a monster\ninsect, monotonous and soporific during the long intervals when the\nscientist was too busy with his controls to engage in conversation.\n\nFor some reason that he could not explain, Northwood had an aversion to\ngoing into the sleeping apartment behind the control room. Then, towards\nmorning, when the suddenly falling temperature struck a biting chill\nthroughout the sun-ship, Northwood, going into the cabin for fur coats,\ndiscovered why his mind and body shrank in horror from the cabin.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter he had procured the fur coats from a closet, he paused a moment,\nin the privacy of the cabin, to look at Athalia's picture. Every nerve\nin his body leaped to meet the magnetism of her beautiful eyes. Never\nhad Mary Burns stirred emotion like this in him. He hung over Mary's\npicture, wistfully, hoping almost prayerfully that he could react to her\nas he did to Athalia; but her pale, over-intellectual face left him\ncold.\n\n\"Cad!\" he ground out between his teeth. \"Forgetting her so soon!\"\n\nThe two pictures were lying side by side on a little table. Suddenly an\nobscure noise in the room caught his attention. It was more vibration\nthan noise, for small sounds could scarcely be heard above the whistle\nof the sun-ship. A slight compression of the air against his neck gave\nhim the eery feeling that someone was standing close behind him. He\nwheeled and looked over his shoulder. Half ashamed of his startled\ngesture, he again turned to his pictures. Then a sharp cry broke from\nhim.\n\nAthalia's picture was gone.\n\nHe searched for it everywhere in the room, in his own pockets, under the\nfurniture. It was nowhere to be found.\n\nIn sudden, overpowering horror, he seized the fur coats and returned to\nthe control room.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Mundson was changing the speed.\n\n\"Look out the window!\" he called to Northwood.\n\nThe young man looked and started violently. Day had come, and now that\nthe sun-ship was flying at a moderate speed, the ocean beneath was\nplainly visible; and its entire surface was covered with broken floes of\nice and small, ragged icebergs. He seized a telescope and focused it\nbelow. A typical polar scene met his eyes: penguins strutted about on\ncakes of ice, a whale blowing in the icy water.\n\n\"A part of the Antarctic that has never been explored,\" said Dr.\nMundson; \"and there, just showing on the horizon, is the Great Ice\nBarrier.\" His characteristic smile lighted the morose black eyes. \"I am\nenough of the dramatist to wish you to be impressed with what I shall\nshow you within less than an hour. Accordingly, I shall make a landing\nand let you feel polar ice under your feet.\"\n\nAfter less than a minute's search, Dr. Mundson found a suitable place on\nthe ice for a landing, and, with a few deft manipulations of the\ncontrols, brought the sun-ship swooping down like an eagle on its prey.\n\nFor a long moment after the scientist had stepped out on the ice,\nNorthwood paused at the door. His feet were chained by a strange\nreluctance to enter this white, dead wilderness of ice. But Dr.\nMundson's impatient, \"Ready?\" drew from him one last glance at the cozy\ninterior of the sun-ship before he, too, went out into the frozen\nstillness.\n\nThey left the sun-ship resting on the ice like a fallen silver moon,\nwhile they wandered to the edge of the Barrier and looked at the gray,\nnarrow stretch of sea between the ice pack and the high cliffs of the\nBarrier. The sun of the commencing six-months' Antarctic day was a low,\ncold ball whose slanted rays struck the ice with blinding whiteness.\nThere were constant falls of ice from the Barrier, which thundered into\nthe ocean amid great clouds of ice smoke that lingered like wraiths\naround the edge. It was a scene of loneliness and waiting death.\n\n\"What's that?\" exclaimed the scientist suddenly.\n\nOut of the white silence shrilled a low whistle, a familiar whistle.\nBoth men wheeled toward the sun-ship.\n\nBefore their horrified eyes, the great sphere jerked and glided up, and\nswerved into the heavens.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUp it soared; then, gaining speed, it swung into the blue distance\nuntil, in a moment, it was a tiny star that flickered out even as they\nwatched.\n\nBoth men screamed and cursed and flung up their arms despairingly. A\npenguin, attracted by their cries, waddled solemnly over to them and\nregarded them with manlike curiosity.\n\n\"Stranded in the coldest spot on earth!\" groaned the scientist.\n\n\"Why did it start itself, Dr. Mundson!\" Northwood narrowed his eyes as\nhe spoke.\n\n\"It didn't!\" The scientist's huge face, red from cold, quivered with\nhelpless rage. \"Human hands started it.\"\n\n\"What! Whose hands?\"\n\n\"_Ach!_ Do I know?\" His Teutonic accent grew more pronounced, as it\nalways did when he was under emotional stress. \"Somebody whose brain is\nbetter than mine. Somebody who found a way to hide away from our eyes.\n_Ach, Gott!_ Don't let me think!\"\n\nHis great head sank between his shoulders, giving him, in his fur suit,\nthe grotesque appearance of a friendly brown bear.\n\n\"Doctor Mundson,\" said Northwood suddenly, \"did you have an enemy, a man\nwith the face and body of a pagan god--a great, blond creature with eyes\nas cold and cruel as the ice under our feet?\"\n\n\"Wait!\" The huge round head jerked up. \"How do you know about Adam? You\nhave not seen him, won't see him until we arrive at our destination.\"\n\n\"But I have seen him. He was sitting not thirty feet from you in the Mad\nHatter's Club last night. Didn't you know? He followed me to the street,\nspoke to me, and then--\" Northwood stopped. How could he let the insane\nwords pass his lips?\n\n\"Then, what? Speak up!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNorthwood laughed nervously. \"It sounds foolish, but I saw him vanish\nlike that.\" He snapped his fingers.\n\n\"_Ach, Gott!_\" All the ruddy color drained from the scientist's face. As\nthough talking to himself, he continued:\n\n\"Then it is true, as he said. He has crossed the bridge. He has reached\nthe Light. And now he comes to see the world he will conquer--came\nunseen when I refused my permission.\"\n\nHe was silent for a long time, pondering. Then he turned passionately to\nNorthwood.\n\n\"John Northwood, kill me! I have brought a new horror into the world.\nFrom the unborn future, I have snatched a creature who has reached the\nLight too soon. Kill me!\" He bowed his great, shaggy head.\n\n\"What do you mean, Dr. Mundson: that this Adam has arrived at a point in\nevolution beyond this age?\"\n\n\"Yes. Think of it! I visioned godlike creatures with the souls of gods.\nBut, Heaven help us, man always will be man: always will lust for\nconquest. You and I, Northwood, and all others are barbarians to Adam.\nHe and his kind will do what men always do to barbarians--conquer and\nkill.\"\n\n\"Are there more like him?\" Northwood struggled with a smile of unbelief.\n\n\"I don't know. I did not know that Adam had reached a point so near the\nultimate. But you have seen. Already he is able to set aside what we\ncall natural laws.\"\n\nNorthwood looked at the scientist closely. The man was surely mad--mad\nin this desert of white death.\n\n\"Come!\" he said cheerfully. \"Let's build an Eskimo snow house. We can\nlive on penguins for days. And who knows what may rescue us?\"\n\nFor three hours the two worked at cutting ice blocks. With snow for\nmortar, they built a crude shelter which enabled them to rest out of the\ncold breath of the spiral polar winds that blew from the south.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Mundson was sitting at the door of their hut, moodily pulling at his\nstrong, black pipe. As though a fit had seized him, he leaped up and let\nhis pipe fall to the ice.\n\n\"Look!\" he shouted. \"The sun-ship!\"\n\nIt seemed but a moment before the tiny speck on the horizon had swept\noverhead, a silver comet on the grayish-blue polar sky. In another\nmoment it had swooped down, eaglewise, scarcely fifty feet from the ice\nhut.\n\nDr. Mundson and Northwood ran forward. From the metal sphere stepped the\nstranger of the Mad Hatter Club. His tall, straight form, erect and\nslim, swung toward them over the ice.\n\n\"Adam!\" shouted Dr. Mundson. \"What does this mean? How dare you!\"\n\nAdam's laugh was like the happy demonstration of a boy. \"So? You think\nyou still are master? You think I returned because I reverenced you\nyet?\" Hate shot viciously through the freezing blue eyes. \"You worm of\nthe Black Age!\"\n\nNorthwood shuddered. He had heard those strange words addressed to\nhimself scarcely more than twelve hours ago.\n\nAdam was still speaking: \"With a thought I could annihilate you where\nyou are standing. But I have use for you. Get in.\" He swept his hand to\nthe sun-ship.\n\nBoth men hesitated. Then Northwood strode forward until he was within\nthree feet of Adam. They stood thus, eyeing each other, two splendid\nbeings, one blond as a Viking, the other dark and vital.\n\n\"Just what is your game?\" demanded Northwood.\n\nThe icy eyes shot forth a gleam like lightning. \"I needn't tell you, of\ncourse, but I may as well let you suffer over the knowledge.\" He curled\nhis lips with superb scorn. \"I have one human weakness. I want Athalia.\"\nThe icy eyes warmed for a fleeting second. \"She is anticipating her\nmeeting with you--bah! The taste of these women of the Black Age! I\ncould kill you, of course; but that would only inflame her. And so I\ntake you to her, thrust you down her throat. When she sees you, she will\nfly to me.\" He spread his magnificent chest.\n\n\"Adam!\" Dr. Mundson's face was dark with anger. \"What of Eve?\"\n\n\"Who are you to question my actions? What a fool you were to let me,\nwhom you forced into life thousands of years too soon, grow more\npowerful than you! Before I am through with all of you petty creatures\nof the Black Age, you will call me more terrible than your Jehovah! For\nsee what you have called forth from unborn time.\"\n\nHe vanished.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBefore the startled men could recover from the shock of it, the vibrant,\ntoo-new voice went on:\n\n\"I am sorry for you, Mundson, because, like you, I need specimens for my\nexperiments. What a splendid specimen you will be!\" His laugh was ugly\nwith significance. \"Get in, worms!\"\n\nUnseen hands cuffed and pushed them into the sun-ship.\n\nInside, Dr. Mundson stumbled to the control room, white and drawn of\nface, his great brain seemingly paralyzed by the catastrophe.\n\n\"You needn't attempt tricks,\" went on the voice. \"I am watching you\nboth. You cannot even hide your thoughts from me.\"\n\nAnd thus began the strange continuation of the journey. Not once, in\nthat wild half-hour's rush over the polar ice clouds, did they see Adam.\nThey saw and heard only the weird signs of his presence: a puffing cigar\nhanging in midair, a glass of water swinging to unseen lips, a ghostly\nvoice hurling threats and insults at them.\n\nOnce the scientist whispered: \"Don't cross him; it is useless. John\nNorthwood, you'll have to fight a demigod for your woman!\"\n\nBecause of the terrific speed of the sun-ship, Northwood could\ndistinguish nothing of the topographical details below. At the end of\nhalf-an-hour, the scientist slowed enough to point out a tall range of\nsnow-covered mountains, over which hovered a play of colored lights like\nthe _aurora australis_.\n\n\"Behind those mountains,\" he said, \"is our destination.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAlmost in a moment, the sun-ship had soared over the peaks. Dr. Mundson\nkept the speed low enough for Northwood to see the splendid view below.\n\nIn the giant cup formed by the encircling mountain range was a green\nvalley of tropical luxuriance. Stretches of dense forest swept half up\nthe mountains and filled the valley cup with tangled verdure. In the\ncenter, surrounded by a broad field and a narrow ring of woods, towered\na group of buildings. From the largest, which was circular, came the\nauroralike radiance that formed an umbrella of light over the entire\nvalley.\n\n\"Do I guess right,\" said Northwood, \"that the light is responsible for\nthis oasis in the ice?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Dr. Mundson. \"In your American slang, it is canned sunshine\ncontaining an overabundance of certain rays, especially the Life Ray,\nwhich I have isolated.\" He smiled proudly. \"You needn't look startled,\nmy friend. Some of the most common things store sunlight. On very dark\nnights, if you have sharp eyes, you can see the radiance given off by\ncertain flowers, which many naturalists say is trapped sunshine. The\nfamiliar nasturtium and the marigold opened for me the way to hold\nsunshine against the long polar night, for they taught me how to apply\nthe Einstein theory of bent light. Stated simply, during the polar\nnight, when the sun is hidden over the rim of the world, we steal some\nof his rays; during the polar day we concentrate the light.\"\n\n\"But could stored sunshine alone give enough warmth for the luxuriant\ngrowth of those jungles?\"\n\n\"An overabundance of the Life Ray is responsible for the miraculous\ngrowth of all life in New Eden. The Life Ray is Nature's most powerful\nforce. Yet Nature is often niggardly and paradoxical in her use of her\npowers. In New Eden, we have forced the powers of creation to take\nascendency over the powers of destruction.\"\n\nAt Northwood's sudden start, the scientist laughed and continued: \"Is it\nnot a pity that Nature, left alone, requires twenty years to make a man\nwho begins to die in another ten years? Such waste is not tolerated in\nNew Eden, where supermen are younger than babes and--\"\n\n\"Come, worms; let's land.\"\n\nIt was Adam's voice. Suddenly he materialized, a blond god, whose eyes\nand flesh were too new.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were in a world of golden skylight, warmth and tropical vegetation.\nThe field on which they had landed was covered with a velvety green\ngrowth of very soft, fine-bladed grass, sprinkled with tiny, star-shaped\nblue flowers. A balmy, sweet-scented wind, downy as the breeze of a\ndream, blew gently along the grass and tingled against Northwood's skin\nrefreshingly. Almost instantly he had the sensation of perfect well\nbeing, and this feeling of physical perfection was part of the ecstasy\nthat seemed to pervade the entire valley. Grass and breeze and golden\nskylight were saturated with a strange ether of joyousness.\n\nAt one end of the field was a dense jungle, cut through by a road that\nled to the towering building from which, while above in the sun-ship,\nthey had seen the golden light issue.\n\nFrom the jungle road came a man and a woman, large, handsome people,\nwhose flesh and eyes had the sinister newness of Adam's. Even before\nthey came close enough to speak, Northwood was aware that while they\nseemed of Adam's breed, they were yet unlike him. The difference was\npsychical rather than physical; they lacked the aura of hate and horror\nthat surrounded Adam. The woman drew Adam's head down and kissed him\naffectionately on both cheeks.\n\nAdam, from his towering height, patted her shoulder impatiently and\nsaid: \"Run on back to the laboratory, grandmother. We're following\nsoon. You have some new human embryos, I believe you told me this\nmorning.\"\n\n\"Four fine specimens, two of them being your sister's twins.\"\n\n\"Splendid! I was sure that creation had stopped with my generation. I\nmust see them.\" He turned to the scientist and Northwood. \"You needn't\ntry to leave this spot. Of course I shall know instantly and deal with\nyou in my own way. Wait here.\"\n\nHe strode over the emerald grass on the heels of the woman.\n\nNorthwood asked: \"Why does he call that girl grandmother?\"\n\n\"Because she is his ancestress.\" He stirred uneasily. \"She is of the\nfirst generation brought forth in the laboratory, and is no different\nfrom you or I, except that, at the age of five years, she is the\nancestress of twenty generations.\"\n\n\"My God!\" muttered Northwood.\n\n\"Don't start being horrified, my friend. Forget about so-called natural\nlaws while you are in New Eden. Remember, here we have isolated the Life\nRay. But look! Here comes your Athalia!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNorthwood gazed covertly at the beautiful girl approaching them with a\nrarely graceful walk. She was tall, slender, round-bosomed,\nnarrow-hipped, and she held her lovely body in the erect poise of\nsplendid health. Northwood had a confused realization of uncovered\nbronzy hair, drawn to the back of a white neck in a bunch of short\ncurls; of immense soft black eyes; lips the color of blood, and\ndelicate, plump flesh on which the golden skylight lingered graciously.\nHe was instantly glad to see that while she possessed the freshness of\nyoung girlhood, her skin and eyes did not have the horrible newness of\nAdam's.\n\nWhen she was still twenty feet distant, Northwood met her eyes and she\nsmiled shyly. The rich, red blood ran through her face; and he, too,\nflushed.\n\nShe went to Dr. Mundson and, placing her hands on his thick shoulders,\nkissed him affectionately.\n\n\"I've been worried about you, Daddy Mundson.\" Her rich contralto voice\nmatched her exotic beauty. \"Since you and Adam had that quarrel the day\nyou left, I did not see him until this morning, when he landed the\nsun-ship alone.\"\n\n\"And you pleaded with him to return for us?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Her eyes drooped and a hot flush swept over her face.\n\nDr. Mundson smiled. \"But I'm back now, Athalia, and I've brought some\none whom I hope you will be glad to know.\"\n\nReaching for her hand, he placed it simply in Northwood's.\n\n\"This is John, Athalia. Isn't he handsomer than the pictures of him\nwhich I televisioned to you? God bless both of you.\"\n\nHe walked ahead and turned his back.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA magical half hour followed for Northwood and Athalia. The girl told\nhim of her past life, how Dr. Mundson had discovered her one year ago\nworking in a New York sweat shop, half dead from consumption. Without\nfriends, she was eager to follow the scientist to New Eden, where he\npromised she would recover her health immediately.\n\n\"And he was right, John,\" she said shyly. \"The Life Ray, that marvelous\nenergy ray which penetrates to the utmost depths of earth and ocean,\ngiving to the cells of all living bodies the power to grow and remain\nanimate, has been concentrated by Dr. Mundson in his stored sunshine.\nThe Life Ray healed me almost immediately.\"\n\nNorthwood looked down at the glorious girl beside him, whose eyes\nalready fluttered away from his like shy black butterflies. Suddenly he\nsqueezed the soft hand in his and said passionately:\n\n\"Athalia! Because Adam wants you and will get you if he can, let us set\naside all the artificialities of civilization. I have loved you madly\never since I saw your picture. If you can say the same to me, it will\ngive me courage to face what I know lies before me.\"\n\nAthalia, her face suddenly tender, came closer to him.\n\n\"John Northwood, I love you.\"\n\nHer red lips came temptingly close; but before he could touch them, Adam\nsuddenly pushed his body between him and Athalia. Adam was pale, and all\nthe iciness was gone from his blue eyes, which were deep and dark and\nvery human. He looked down at Athalia, and she looked up at him, two\nhandsome specimens of perfect manhood and womanhood.\n\n\"Fast work, Athalia!\" The new vibrant voice was strained. \"I was hoping\nyou would be disappointed in him, especially after having been wooed by\nme this morning. I could take you if I wished, of course; but I prefer\nto win you in the ancient manner. Dismiss him!\" He jerked his thumb over\nhis shoulder in Northwood's direction.\n\nAthalia flushed vividly and looked at him almost compassionately. \"I am\nnot great enough for you, Adam. I dare not love you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAdam laughed, and still oblivious of Northwood and Dr. Mundson, folded\nhis arms over his breast. With the golden skylight on his burnished\nhair, he was a valiant, magnificent spectacle.\n\n\"Since the beginning of time, gods and archangels have looked upon the\ndaughters of men and found them fair. Mate with me, Athalia, and I,\nfifty thousand years beyond the creature Mundson has selected for you,\nwill make you as I am, the deathless overlord of life and all nature.\"\n\nHe drew her hand to his bosom.\n\nFor one dark moment, Northwood felt himself seared by jealousy, for,\nthrough the plump, sweet flesh of Athalia's face, he saw the red blood\nleap again. How could she withhold herself from this splendid superman?\n\nBut her answer, given with faltering voice, was the old, simple one: \"I\nhave promised him, Adam. I love him.\" Tears trembled on her thick\nlashes.\n\n\"So! I cannot get you in the ancient manner. Now I'll use my own.\"\n\nHe seized her in his arms crushed her against him, and, laughing over\nher head at Northwood, bent his glistening head and kissed her on the\nmouth.\n\nThere was a blinding flash of blue electric sparks--and nothing else.\nBoth Adam and Athalia had vanished.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAdam's voice came in a last mocking challenge: \"I shall be what no other\ngods before me have been--a good sport. I'll leave you both to your own\ndevices, until I want you again.\"\n\nWhite-lipped and trembling, Northwood groaned: \"What has he done now?\"\n\nDr. Mundson's great head drooped. \"I don't know. Our bodies are electric\nand chemical machines; and a super intelligence has discovered new laws\nof which you and I are ignorant.\"\n\n\"But Athalia....\"\n\n\"She is safe; he loves her.\"\n\n\"Loves her!\" Northwood shivered. \"I cannot believe that those freezing\neyes could ever look with love on a woman.\"\n\n\"Adam is a man. At heart he is as human as the first man-creature that\nwallowed in the new earth's slime.\" His voice dropped as though he were\nmusing aloud. \"It might be well to let him have Athalia. She will help\nto keep vigor in the new race, which would stop reproducing in another\nfew generations without the injection of Black Age blood.\"\n\n\"Do you want to bring more creatures like Adam into the world?\"\nNorthwood flung at him. \"You have tampered with life enough, Dr.\nMundson. But, although Adam has my sympathy, I'm not willing to turn\nAthalia over to him.\"\n\n\"Well said! Now come to the laboratory for chemical nourishment and rest\nunder the Life Ray.\"\n\nThey went to the great circular building from whose highest tower issued\nthe golden radiance that shamed the light of the sun, hanging low in the\nnortheast.\n\n\"John Northwood,\" said Dr. Mundson, \"with that laboratory, which is the\ncenter of all life in New Eden, we'll have to whip Adam. He gave us what\nhe called a 'sporting chance' because he knew that he is able to send us\nand all mankind to a doom more terrible than hell. Even now we might be\nentering some hideous trap that he has set for us.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey entered by a side entrance and went immediately to what Dr. Mundson\ncalled the Rest Ward. Here, in a large room, were ranged rows of cots,\non many of which lay men basking in the deep orange flood of light which\npoured from individual lamps set above each cot.\n\n\"It is the Life Ray!\" said Dr. Mundson reverently. \"The source of all\ngrowth and restoration in Nature. It is the power that bursts open the\nseed and brings forth the shoot, that increases the shoot into a giant\ntree. It is the same power that enables the fertilized ovum to develop\ninto an animal. It creates and recreates cells almost instantly;\naccordingly, it is the perfect substitute for sleep. Stretch out, enjoy\nits power; and while you rest, eat these nourishing tablets.\"\n\nNorthwood lay on a cot, and Dr. Mundson turned the Life Ray on him. For\na few minutes a delicious drowsiness fell upon him, producing a spell of\nperfect peace which the cells of his being seemed to drink in. For\nanother delirious, fleeting space, every inch of him vibrated with a\nthrilling sensation of freshness. He took a deep, ecstatic breath and\nopened his eyes.\n\n\"Enough,\" said Dr. Mundson, switching off the Ray. \"After three minutes\nof rejuvenation, you are commencing again with perfect cells. All\nravages from disease and wear have been corrected.\"\n\nNorthwood leaped up joyously. His handsome eyes sparkled, his skin\nglowed. \"I feel great! Never felt so good since I was a kid.\"\n\nA pleased grin spread over the scientist's homely face. \"See what my\ndiscovery will mean to the world! In the future we shall all go to the\nlaboratory for recuperation and nourishment. We'll have almost\ntwenty-four hours a day for work and play.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe stretched out on the bed contentedly. \"Some day, when my work is\nnearly done, I shall permit the Life Ray to cure my hump.\"\n\n\"Why not now?\"\n\nDr. Mundson sighed. \"If I were perfect, I should cease to be so\noverwhelmingly conscious of the importance of perfection.\" He settled\nback to enjoyment of the Life Ray.\n\nA few minutes later, he jumped up, alert as a boy. \"_Ach!_ That's fine.\nNow I'll show you how the Life Ray speeds up development and produces\nfour generations of humans a year.\"\n\nWith restored energy, Northwood began thinking of Athalia. As he\nfollowed Dr. Mundson down a long corridor, he yearned to see her again,\nto be certain that she was safe. Once he imagined he felt a gentle,\nsoft-fleshed touch against his hand, and was disappointed not to see her\nwalking by his side. Was she with him, unseen? The thought was sweet.\n\nBefore Dr. Mundson opened the massive bronze door at the end of the\ncorridor, he said:\n\n\"Don't be surprised or shocked over anything you see here, John\nNorthwood. This is the Baby Laboratory.\"\n\nThey entered a room which seemed no different from a hospital ward. On\nlittle white beds lay naked children of various sizes, perfect,\nsolemn-eyed youngsters and older children as beautiful as animated\nstatues. Above each bed was a small Life Ray projector. A white-capped\nnurse went from bed to bed.\n\n\"They are recuperating from the daily educational period,\" said the\nscientist. \"After a few minutes of this they will go into the growing\nroom, which I shall have to show you through a window. Should you and I\nenter, we might be changed in a most extraordinary manner.\" He laughed\nmischievously. \"But, look, Northwood!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe slid back a panel in the wall, and Northwood peered in through a\nthick pane of clear glass. The room was really an immense outdoor arena,\nits only carpet the fine-bladed grass, its roof the blue sky cut in the\nmiddle by an enormous disc from which shot the aurora of trapped\nsunshine which made a golden umbrella over the valley. Through openings\nin the bottom of the disc poured a fine rain of rays which fell\nconstantly upon groups of children, youths and young girls, all clad in\nthe merest scraps of clothing. Some were dancing, others were playing\ngames, but all seemed as supremely happy as the birds and butterflies\nwhich fluttered about the shrubs and flowers edging the arena.\n\n\"I don't expect you to believe,\" said Dr. Mundson, \"that the oldest\nyoung man in there is three months old. You cannot see visible changes\nin a body which grows as slowly as the human being, whose normal period\nof development is twenty years or more. But I can give you visible proof\nof how fast growth takes place under the full power of the Life Ray.\nPlant life, which, even when left to nature, often develops from seed to\nflower within a few weeks or months, can be seen making its miraculous\nchanges under the Life Ray. Watch those gorgeous purple flowers over\nwhich the butterflies are hovering.\"\n\nNorthwood followed his pointing finger. Near the glass window through\nwhich they looked grew an enormous bank of resplendent violet colored\nflowers, which literally enshrouded the entire bush with their royal\nglory. At first glance it seemed as though a violent wind were\nsnatching at flower and bush, but closer inspection proved that the\nagitation was part of the plant itself. And then he saw that the\nmovements were the result of perpetual composition and growth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe fastened his eyes on one huge bud. He saw it swell, burst, spread out\nits passionate purple velvet, lift the broad flower face to the light\nfor a joyous minute. A few seconds later a butterfly lighted airily to\nsample its nectar and to brush the pollen from its yellow dusted wings.\nScarcely had the winged visitor flown away than the purple petals began\nto wither and fall away, leaving the seed pod on the stem. The visible\nchange went on in this seed pod. It turned rapidly brown, dried out, and\nthen sent the released seeds in a shower to the rich black earth below.\nScarcely had the seeds touched the ground than they sent up tiny green\nshoots that grew larger each moment. Within ten minutes there was a new\nplant a foot high. Within half an hour, the plant budded, blossomed, and\ncast forth its own seed.\n\n\"You understand?\" asked the scientist. \"Development is going on as\nrapidly among the children. Before the first year has passed, the\nyoungest baby will have grandchildren; that is, if the baby tests out\nfit to pass its seed down to the new generation. I know it sounds\nabsurd. Yet you saw the plant.\"\n\n\"But Doctor,\" Northwood rubbed his jaw thoughtfully, \"Nature's forces of\ndestruction, of tearing down, are as powerful as her creative powers.\nYou have discovered the ultimate in creation and upbuilding. But\nperhaps--oh, Lord, it is too awful to think!\"\n\n\"Speak, Northwood!\" The scientist's voice was impatient.\n\n\"It is nothing!\" The pale young man attempted a smile. \"I was only\nimagining some of the horror that could be thrust on the world if a\nsupermind like Adam's should discover Nature's secret of death and\ndestruction and speed it up as you have sped the life force.\"\n\n\"_Ach Gott!_\" Dr. Mundson's face was white. \"He has his own laboratory,\nwhere he works every day. Don't talk so loud. He might be listening. And\nI believe he can do anything he sets out to accomplish.\"\n\nClose to Northwood's ear fell a faint, triumphant whisper: \"Yes, he can\ndo anything. How did you guess, worm?\"\n\nIt was Adam's voice.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Now come and see the Leyden jar mothers,\" said Dr. Mundson. \"We do not\nwait for the child to be born to start our work.\"\n\nHe took Northwood to a laboratory crowded with strange apparatus, where\nyoung men and women worked. Northwood knew instantly that these people,\nalthough unusually handsome and strong, were not of Adam's generation.\nNone of them had the look of newness which marked those who had grown up\nunder the Life Ray.\n\n\"They are the perfect couples whom I combed the world to find,\" said the\nscientist. \"From their eugenic marriages sprang the first children that\npassed through the laboratory. I had hoped,\" he hesitated and looked\nsideways at Northwood, \"I had dreamed of having the children of you and\nAthalia to help strengthen the New Race.\"\n\nA wave of sudden disgust passed over Northwood.\n\n\"Thanks,\" he said tartly. \"When I marry Athalia, I intend to have an\nold-fashioned home and a Black Age family. I don't relish having my\nchildren turned into--experiments.\"\n\n\"But wait until you see all the wonders of the laboratory! That is why I\nam showing you all this.\"\n\nNorthwood drew his handkerchief and mopped his brow. \"It sickens me,\nDoctor! The more I see, the more pity I have for Adam--and the less I\nblame him for his rebellion and his desire to kill and to rule. Heavens!\nWhat a terrible thing you have done, experimenting with human life.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! Can you say that all life--all matter--is not the result of\nscientific experiment? Can you?\" His black gaze made Northwood\nuncomfortable. \"Buck up, young friend, for now I am going to show you a\nmarvelous improvement on Nature's bungling ways--the Leyden jar mother.\"\nHe raised his voice and called, \"Lilith!\"\n\nThe woman whom they had met on the field came forward.\n\n\"May we take a peep at Lona's twins?\" asked the scientist. \"They are\nabout ready to go to the growing dome, are they not?\"\n\n\"In five more minutes,\" said the woman. \"Come see.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe lifted one of the black velvet curtains that lined an entire side of\nthe laboratory and thereby disclosed a globular jar of glass and metal,\nconnected by wires to a dynamo. Above the jar was a Life Ray projector.\nLilith slid aside a metal portion of the jar, disclosing through the\nglass underneath the squirming, kicking body of a baby, resting on a bed\nof soft, spongy substance, to which it was connected by the navel cord.\n\n\"The Leyden jar mother,\" said Dr. Mundson. \"It is the dream of us\nscientists realized. The human mother's body does nothing but nourish\nand protect her unborn child, a job which science can do better. And so,\nin New Eden, we take the young embryo and place it in the Leyden jar\nmother, where the Life Ray, electricity, and chemical food shortens the\nperiod of gestation to a few days.\"\n\nAt that moment a bell under the Leyden jar began to ring. Dr. Mundson\nuncovered the jar and lifted out the child, a beautiful, perfectly\nformed boy, who began to cry lustily.\n\n\"Here is one baby who'll never be kissed,\" he said. \"He'll be nourished\nchemically, and, at the end of the week, will no longer be a baby. If\nyou are patient, you can actually see the processes of development\ntaking place under the Life Ray, for babies develop very fast.\"\n\nNorthwood buried his face in his hands. \"Lord! This is awful. No\nchildhood; no mother to mould his mind! No parents to watch over him, to\ngive him their tender care!\"\n\n\"Awful, fiddlesticks! Come see how children get their education, how\nthey learn to use their hands and feet so they need not pass through the\nawkwardness of childhood.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe led Northwood to a magnificent building whose fa\u00e7ade of white marble\nwas as simply beautiful as a Greek temple. The side walls, built almost\nentirely of glass, permitted the synthetic sunshine to sweep from end to\nend. They first entered a library, where youths and young girls poured\nover books of all kinds. Their manner of reading mystified Northwood.\nWith a single sweep of the eye, they seemed to devour a page, and then\nturned to the next. He stepped closer to peer over the shoulder of a\nbeautiful girl. She was reading \"Euclid's Elements of Geometry,\" in\nLatin, and she turned the pages as swiftly as the other girl occupying\nher table, who was devouring \"Paradise Lost.\"\n\nDr. Mundson whispered to him: \"If you do not believe that Ruth here is\ngetting her Euclid, which she probably never saw before to-day, examine\nher from the book; that is, if you are a good enough Latin scholar.\"\n\nRuth stopped her reading to talk to him, and, in a few minutes, had\ncompletely dumbfounded him with her pedantic replies, which fell from\nlips as luscious and unformed as an infant's.\n\n\"Now,\" said Dr. Mundson, \"test Rachael on her Milton. As far as she has\nread, she should not misquote a line, and her comments will probably\nprove her scholarly appreciation of Milton.\"\n\nWord for word, Rachael was able to give him \"Paradise Lost\" from memory,\nexcept the last four pages, which she had not read. Then, taking the\nbook from him, she swept her eyes over these pages, returned the book to\nhim, and quoted copiously and correctly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Mundson gloated triumphantly over his astonishment. \"There, my\nfriend. Could you now be satisfied with old-fashioned children who spend\nlong, expensive years in getting an education? Of course, your children\nwill not have the perfect brains of these, yet, developed under the Life\nRay, they should have splendid mentality.\n\n\"These children, through selective breeding, have brains that make\neverlasting records instantly. A page in a book, once seen, is indelibly\nretained by them, and understood. The same is true of a lecture, of an\nexplanation given by a teacher, of even idle conversation. Any man or\nwoman in this room should be able to repeat the most trivial\nconversation days old.\"\n\n\"But what of the arts, Dr. Mundson? Surely even your supermen and women\ncannot instantly learn to paint a masterpiece or to guide their fingers\nand their brains through the intricacies of a difficult musical\ncomposition.\"\n\n\"No?\" His dark eyes glowed. \"Come see!\"\n\nBefore they entered another wing of the building, they heard a violin\nbeing played masterfully.\n\nDr. Mundson paused at the door.\n\n\"So that you may understand what you shall see, let me remind you that\nthe nerve impulses and the coordinating means in the human body are\npurely electrical. The world has not yet accepted my theory, but it\nwill. Under superman's system of education, the instantaneous records\nmade on the brain give immediate skill to the acting parts of the body.\nAccordingly, musicians are made over night.\"\n\nHe threw open the door. Under a Life Ray projector, a beautiful,\nJuno-esque woman was playing a violin. Facing her, and with eyes\nfastened to hers, stood a young man, whose arms and slender fingers\nmimicked every motion she made. Presently she stopped playing and handed\nthe violin to him. In her own masterly manner, he repeated the score she\nhad played.\n\n\"That is Eve,\" whispered Dr. Mundson. \"I had selected her as Adam's\nwife. But he does not want her, the most brilliant woman of the New\nRace.\"\n\nNorthwood gave the woman an appraising look. \"Who wants a perfect woman?\nI don't blame Adam for preferring Athalia. But how is she teaching her\npupil?\"\n\n\"Through thought vibration, which these perfect people have developed\nuntil they can record permanently the radioactive waves of the brains of\nothers.\"\n\nEve turned, caught Northwood's eyes in her magnetic blue gaze, and\nsmiled as only a goddess can smile upon a mortal she has marked as her\nown. She came toward him with outflung hands.\n\n\"So you have come!\" Her vibrant contralto voice, like Adam's, held the\nbirdlike, broken tremulo of a young child's. \"I have been waiting for\nyou, John Northwood.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHer eyes, as blue and icy as Adam's, lingered long on him, until he\nflinched from their steely magnetism. She slipped her arm through his\nand drew him gently but firmly from the room, while Dr. Mundson stood\ngaping after them.\n\nThey were on a flagged terrace arched with roses of gigantic size, which\nsent forth billows of sensuous fragrance. Eve led him to a white marble\nseat piled with silk cushions, on which she reclined her superb body,\nwhile she regarded him from narrowed lids.\n\n\"I saw your picture that he televisioned to Athalia,\" she said. \"What a\nbotch Dr. Mundson has made of his mating.\" Her laugh rippled like\nfalling water. \"I want you, John Northwood!\"\n\nNorthwood started and blushed furiously. Smile dimples broke around her\nred, humid lips.\n\n\"Ah, you're old-fashioned!\"\n\nHer large, beautiful hand, fleshed more tenderly than any woman's hand\nhe had ever seen, went out to him appealingly. \"I can bring you amorous\ndelight that your Athalia never could offer in her few years of youth.\nAnd I'll never grow old, John Northwood.\"\n\nShe came closer until he could feel the fragrant warmth of her tawny,\nribbon bound hair pulse against his face. In sudden panic he drew back.\n\n\"But I am pledged to Athalia!\" tumbled from him. \"It is all a dreadful\nmistake, Eve. You and Adam were created for each other.\"\n\n\"Hush!\" The lightning that flashed from her blue eyes changed her from\nseductress to angry goddess. \"Created for each other! Who wants a\nmade-to-measure lover?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe luscious lips trembled slightly, and into the vivid eyes crept a\nsuspicion of moisture. Eternal Eve's weapons! Northwood's handsome face\nrelaxed with pity.\n\n\"I want you, John Northwood,\" she continued shamelessly. \"Our love will\nbe sublime.\" She leaned heavily against him, and her lips were like a\nblood red flower pressed against white satin. \"Come, beloved, kiss me!\"\n\nNorthwood gasped and turned his head. \"Don't, Eve!\"\n\n\"But a kiss from me will set you apart from all your generation, John\nNorthwood, and you shall understand what no man of the Black Age could\npossibly fathom.\"\n\nHer hair had partly fallen from its ribbon bandage and poured its\nfragrant gold against his shoulder.\n\n\"For God's sake, don't tempt me!\" he groaned. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"That mental and physical and spiritual contact with me will temporarily\ngive you, a three-dimension creature, the power of the new sense, which\nyour race will not have for fifty thousand years.\"\n\nWhite-lipped and trembling, he demanded: \"Explain!\"\n\nEve smiled. \"Have you not guessed that Adam has developed an additional\nsense? You've seen him vanish. He and I have the sixth sense of Time\nPerception--the new sense which enables us to penetrate what you of the\nBlack Age call the Fourth Dimension. Even you whose mentalities are\nframed by three dimensions have this sixth sense instinct. Your very\nreligion is based on it, for you believe that in another life you shall\nstep into Time, or, as you call it, eternity.\" She leaned closer so that\nher hair brushed his cheek. \"What is eternity, John Northwood? Is it not\nkeeping forever ahead of the Destroyer? The future is eternal, for it is\nnever reached. Adam and I, through our new sense which comprehends Time\nand Space, can vanish by stepping a few seconds into the future, the\nFourth Dimension of Space. Death can never reach us, not even accidental\ndeath, unless that which causes death could also slip into the future,\nwhich is not yet possible.\"\n\n\"But if the Fourth Dimension is future Time, why can one in the third\ndimension feel the touch of an unseen presence in the Fourth\nDimension--hear his voice, even?\"\n\n\"Thought vibration. The touch is not really felt nor the voice heard:\nthey are only imagined. The radioactive waves of the brain of even you\nBlack Age people are swift enough to bridge Space and Time. And it is\nthe mind that carries us beyond the third dimension.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHer red mouth reached closer to him, her blue eyes touched hidden forces\nthat slept in remote cells of his being. \"You are going into Eternal\nTime, John Northwood, Eternity without beginning or end. You understand?\nYou feel it? Comprehend it? Now for the contact--kiss me!\"\n\nNorthwood had seen Athalia vanish under Adam's kiss. Suddenly, in one\nmad burst of understanding, he leaned over to his magnificent temptress.\n\nFor a split second he felt the sweet pressure of baby-soft lips, and\nthen the atoms of his body seemed to fly asunder. Black chaos held him\nfor a frightful moment before he felt sanity return.\n\nHe was back on the terrace again, with Eve by his side. They were\nstanding now. The world about him looked the same, yet there was a\nsubtle change in everything.\n\nEve laughed softly. \"It is puzzling, isn't it? You're seeing everything\nas in a mirror. What was left before is now right. Only you and I are\nreal. All else is but a vision, a dream. For now you and I are existing\none minute in future time, or, more simply, we are in the Fourth\nDimension. To everything in the third dimension, we are invisible. Let\nme show you that Dr. Mundson cannot see you.\"\n\nThey went back to the room beyond the terrace. Dr. Mundson was not\npresent.\n\n\"There he goes down the jungle path,\" said Eve, looking out a window.\nShe laughed. \"Poor old fellow. The children of his genius are worrying\nhim.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were standing in the recess formed by a bay window. Eve picked up\nhis hand and laid it against her face, giving him the full, blasting\nglory of her smiling blue eyes.\n\nNorthwood, looking away miserably, uttered a low cry. Coming over the\nfield beyond were Adam and Athalia. By the trimming on the blue dress\nshe wore, he could see that she was still in the Fourth Dimension, for\nhe did not see her as a mirror image.\n\nA look of fear leaped to Eve's face. She clutched Northwood's arm,\ntrembling.\n\n\"I don't want Adam to see that I have passed you beyond,\" she gasped.\n\"We are existing but one minute in the future. Always Adam and I have\nfeared to pass too far beyond the sweetness of reality. But now, so that\nAdam may not see us, we shall step five minutes into what-is-yet-to-be.\nAnd even he, with all his power, cannot see into a future that is more\ndistant than that in which he exists.\"\n\nShe raised her humid lips to his. \"Come, beloved.\"\n\nNorthwood kissed her. Again came the moment of confusion, of the awful\nvacancy that was like death, and then he found himself and Eve in the\nlaboratory, following Adam and Athalia down a long corridor. Athalia was\ncrying and pleading frantically with Adam. Once she stopped and threw\nherself at his feet in a gesture of dramatic supplication, arms\noutflung, streaming eyes wide open with fear.\n\nAdam stooped and lifted her gently and continued on his way, supporting\nher against his side.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEve dug her fingers into Northwood's arm. Horror contorted her face,\nhorror mixed with rage.\n\n\"My mind hears what he is saying, understands the vile plan he has made,\nJohn Northwood. He is on his way to his laboratory to destroy not only\nyou and most of these in New Eden, but me as well. He wants only\nAthalia.\"\n\nStriding forward like an avenging goddess, she pulled Northwood after\nher.\n\n\"Hurry!\" she whispered. \"Remember, you and I are five minutes in the\nfuture, and Adam is only one. We are witnessing what will occur four\nminutes from now. We yet have time to reach the laboratory before him\nand be ready for him when he enters. And because he will have to go back\nto Present Time to do his work of destruction, I will be able to destroy\nhim. Ah!\"\n\nFierce joy burned in her flashing blue eyes, and her slender nostrils\nquivered delicately. Northwood, peeping at her in horror, knew that no\nmercy could be expected of her. And when she stopped at a certain door\nand inserted a key, he remembered Athalia. What if she should enter with\nAdam in Present Time?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were inside Adam's laboratory, a huge apartment filled with queer\napparatus and cages of live animals. The room was a strange paradox.\nPart of the equipment, the walls, and the floor was glistening with\nnewness, and part was moulding with extreme age. The powers of\ndisintegration that haunt a tropical forest seemed to be devouring\ncertain spots of the room. Here, in the midst of bright marble, was a\nsection of wall that seemed as old as the pyramids. The surface of the\nstone had an appalling mouldiness, as though it had been lifted from an\nancient graveyard where it had lain in the festering ground for\nunwholesome centuries.\n\nBetween cracks in this stained and decayed section of stone grew fetid\nmoss that quivered with the microscopic organisms that infest age-rotten\nplaces. Sections of the flooring and woodwork also reeked with\nmustiness. In one dark, webby corner of the room lay a pile of bleached\nbones, still tinted with the ghastly grays and pinks of putrefaction.\nNorthwood, overwhelmingly nauseated, withdrew his eyes from the bones,\nonly to see, in another corner, a pile of worm-eaten clothing that lay\non the floor in the outline of a man.\n\nFaint with the reek of ancient mustiness, Northwood retreated to the\ndoor, dizzy and staggering.\n\n\"It sickens you,\" said Eve, \"and it sickens me also, for death and decay\nare not pleasant. Yet Nature, left to herself, reduces all to this.\nEvery grave that has yawned to receive its prey hides corruption no less\nshocking. Nature's forces of creation and destruction forever work in\npartnership. Never satisfied with her composition, she destroys and\nstarts again, building, building towards the ultimate of perfection.\nThus, it is natural that if Dr. Mundson isolated the Life Ray, Nature's\nsupreme force of compensation, isolation of the Death Ray should closely\nfollow. Adam, thirsting for power, has succeeded. A few sweeps of his\nunholy ray of decomposition will undo all Dr. Mundson's work in this\nvalley and reduce it to a stinking holocaust of destruction. And the\ntime for his striking has come!\"\n\nShe seized his face and drew it toward her. \"Quick!\" she said. \"We'll\nhave to go back to the third dimension. I could leave you safe in the\nfourth, but if anything should happen to me, you would be stranded\nforever in future time.\"\n\nShe kissed his lips. In a moment, he was back in the old familiar world,\nwhere right is right and left is left. Again the subtle change wrought\nby Eve's magic lips had taken place.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEve went to a machine standing in a corner of the room.\n\n\"Come here and get behind me, John Northwood. I want to test it before\nhe enters.\"\n\nNorthwood stood behind her shoulder.\n\n\"Now watch!\" she ordered. \"I shall turn it on one of those cages of\nguinea pigs over there.\"\n\nShe swung the projector around, pointed it at the cage of small,\nsquealing animals, and threw a lever. Instantly a cone of black mephitis\nshot forth, a loathsome, bituminous stream of putrefaction that reeked\nof the grave and the cesspool, of the utmost reaches of decay before the\ndust accepts the disintegrated atoms. The first touch of seething,\npitchy destruction brought screams of sudden agony from the guinea pigs,\nbut the screams were cut short as the little animals fell in shocking,\ninstant decay. The very cage which imprisoned them shriveled and\nretreated from the hellish, devouring breath that struck its noisome rot\ninto the heart of the wood and the metal, reducing both to revolting\nruin.\n\nEve cut off the frightful power, and the black cone disappeared, leaving\nthe room putrid with its defilement.\n\n\"And Adam would do that to the world,\" she said, her blue eyes like\nelectric-shot icicles. \"He would do it to you, John Northwood--and to\nme!\" Her full bosom strained under the passion beneath.\n\n\"Listen!\" She raised her hand warningly. \"He comes! The destroyer\ncomes!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA hand was at the door. Eve reached for the lever, and, the same moment,\nNorthwood leaned over her imploringly.\n\n\"If Athalia is with him!\" he gasped. \"You will not harm her?\"\n\nA wild shriek at the door, a slight scuffle, and then the doorknob was\nwrenched as though two were fighting over it.\n\n\"For God's sake, Eve!\" implored Northwood. \"Wait! Wait!\"\n\n\"No! She shall die, too. You love her!\"\n\nIcy, cruel eyes cut into him, and a new-fleshed hand tried to push him\naside. The door was straining open. A beloved voice shrieked. \"John!\"\n\nEve and Northwood both leaped for the lever. Under her tender white\nflesh she was as strong as a man. In the midst of the struggle, her red,\nhumid lips approached his--closer. Closer. Their merest pressure would\nthrust him into Future Time, where the laboratory and all it contained\nwould be but a shadow, and where he would be helpless to interfere with\nher terrible will.\n\nHe saw the door open and Adam stride into the room. Behind him, lying\nprone in the hall where she had probably fainted, was Athalia. In a mad\nburst of strength he touched the lever together with Eve.\n\nThe projector, belching forth its stinking breath of corruption swung in\na mad arc over the ceiling, over the walls--and then straight at Adam.\n\nThen, quicker than thought, came the accident. Eve, attempting to throw\nNorthwood off, tripped, fell half over the machine, and, with a short\nscream of despair, dropped into the black path of destruction.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNorthwood paused, horrified. The Death Ray was pointed at an inner wall\nof the room, which, even as he looked, crumbled and disappeared,\nbringing down upon him dust more foul than any obscenity the bowels of\nthe earth might yield. In an instant the black cone ate through the\nouter parts of the building, where crashing stone and screams that were\nmore horrible because of their shortness followed the ruin that swept\nfar into the fair reaches of the valley.\n\nThe paralyzing odor of decay took his breath, numbed his muscles, until,\nof all that huge building, the wall behind him and one small section of\nthe room by the doorway alone remained whole. He was trying to nerve\nhimself to reach for the lever close to that quiet formless thing still\npartly draped over the machine, when a faint sound in the door\nelectrified him. At first, he dared not look, but his own name, spoken\nalmost in a gasp, gave him courage.\n\nAthalia lay on the floor, apparently untouched.\n\nHe jerked the lever violently before running to her, exultant with the\nknowledge that his own efforts to keep the ray from the door had saved\nher.\n\n\"And you're not hurt!\" He gathered her close.\n\n\"John! I saw it get Adam.\" She pointed to a new mound of mouldy clothes\non the floor. \"Oh, it is hideous for me to be so glad, but he was going\nto destroy everything and everyone except me. He made the ray projector\nfor that one purpose.\"\n\nNorthwood looked over the pile of putrid ruins which a few minutes ago\nhad been a building. There was not a wall left intact.\n\n\"His intention is accomplished, Athalia,\" he said sadly. \"Let's get out\nbefore more stones fall.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn a moment they were in the open. An ominous stillness seemed to grip\nthe very air--the awful silence of the polar wastes which lay not far\nbeyond the mountains.\n\n\"How dark it is, John!\" cried Athalia. \"Dark and cold!\"\n\n\"The sunshine projector!\" gasped Northwood. \"It must have been\ndestroyed. Look, dearest! The golden light has disappeared.\"\n\n\"And the warm air of the valley will lift immediately. That means a\npolar blizzard.\" She shuddered and clung closer to him. \"I've seen\nAntarctic storms, John. They're death.\"\n\nNorthwood avoided her eyes. \"There's the sun-ship. We'll give the ruins\nthe once over in case there are any survivors; then we'll save\nourselves.\"\n\nEven a cursory examination of the mouldy piles of stone and dust\nconvinced them that there could be no survivors. The ruins looked as\nthough they had lain in those crumbling piles for centuries. Northwood,\nsmothering his repugnance, stepped among them--among the green, slimy\nstones and the unspeakable revolting d\u00e9bris, staggering back and faint\nand shocked when he came upon dust that was once human.\n\n\"God!\" he groaned, hands over eyes. \"We're alone, Athalia! Alone in a\ncharnal house. The laboratory housed the entire population, didn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes. Needing no sleep nor food, we did not need houses. We all worked\nhere, under Dr. Mundson's generalship, and, lately under Adam's, like a\nlittle band of soldiers fighting for a great cause.\"\n\n\"Let's go to the sun-ship, dearest.\"\n\n\"But Daddy Mundson was in the library,\" sobbed Athalia. \"Let's look for\nhim a little longer.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSudden remembrance came to Northwood. \"No, Athalia! He left the library.\nI saw him go down the jungle path several minutes before I and Eve went\nto Adam's laboratory.\"\n\n\"Then he might be safe!\" Her eyes danced. \"He might have gone to the\nsun-ship.\"\n\nShivering, she slumped against him. \"Oh, John! I'm cold.\"\n\nHer face was blue. Northwood jerked off his coat and wrapped it around\nher, taking the intense cold against his unprotected shoulders. The low,\ngray sky was rapidly darkening, and the feeble light of the sun could\nscarcely pierce the clouds. It was disturbing to know that even the\nsummer temperature in the Antarctic was far below zero.\n\n\"Come, girl,\" said Northwood gravely. \"Hurry! It's snowing.\"\n\nThey started to run down the road through the narrow strip of jungle.\nThe Death Ray had cut huge swathes in the tangle of trees and vines, and\nnow areas of heaped d\u00e9bris, livid with the colors of recent decay,\nexhaled a mephitic humidity altogether alien to the snow that fell in\nsoft, slow flakes. Each hesitated to voice the new fear: had the\nsun-ship been destroyed?\n\nBy the time they reached the open field, the snow stung their flesh like\nsharp needles, but it was not yet thick enough to hide from them a\nhideous fact.\n\nThe sun-ship was gone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt might have occupied one of several black, foul areas on the green\ngrass, where the searching Death Ray had made the very soil putrefy, and\nthe rocks crumble into shocking dust.\n\nNorthwood snatched Athalia to him, too full of despair to speak. A\nsudden terrific flurry of snow whirled around them, and they were almost\nblown from their feet by the icy wind that tore over the unprotected\nfield.\n\n\"It won't be long,\" said Athalia faintly. \"Freezing doesn't hurt, John,\ndear.\"\n\n\"It isn't fair, Athalia! There never would have been such a marriage as\nours. Dr. Mundson searched the world to bring us together.\"\n\n\"For scientific experiment!\" she sobbed. \"I'd rather die, John. I want\nan old-fashioned home, a Black Age family. I want to grow old with you\nand leave the earth to my children. Or else I want to die here now under\nthe kind, white blanket the snow is already spreading over us.\" She\ndrooped in his arms.\n\nClinging together, they stood in the howling wind, looking at each other\nhungrily, as though they would snatch from death this one last picture\nof the other.\n\nNorthwood's freezing lips translated some of the futile words that\ncrowded against them. \"I love you because you are not perfect. I hate\nperfection!\"\n\n\"Yes. Perfection is the only hopeless state, John. That is why Adam\nwanted to destroy, so that he might build again.\"\n\nThey were sitting in the snow now, for they were very tired. The storm\nbegan whistling louder, as though it were only a few feet above their\nheads.\n\n\"That sounds almost like the sun-ship,\" said Athalia drowsily.\n\n\"It's only the wind. Hold your face down so it won't strike your flesh\nso cruelly.\"\n\n\"I'm not suffering. I'm getting warm again.\" She smiled at him sleepily.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLittle icicles began to form on their clothing, and the powdery snow\nfrosted their uncovered hair.\n\nSuddenly came a familiar voice: \"_Ach Gott!_\"\n\nDr. Mundson stood before them, covered with snow until he looked like a\npolar bear.\n\n\"Get up!\" he shouted. \"Quick! To the sun-ship!\"\n\nHe seized Athalia and jerked her to her feet. She looked at him sleepily\nfor a moment, and then threw herself at him and hugged him frantically.\n\n\"You're not dead?\"\n\nTaking each by the arm, he half dragged them to the sun-ship, which had\nlanded only a few feet away. In a few minutes he had hot brandy for\nthem.\n\nWhile they sipped greedily, he talked, between working the sun-ship's\ncontrols.\n\n\"No, I wouldn't say it was a lucky moment that drew me to the sun-ship.\nWhen I saw Eve trying to charm John, I had what you American slangists\ncall a hunch, which sent me to the sun-ship to get it off the ground so\nthat Adam couldn't commandeer it. And what is a hunch but a mental\npenetration into the Fourth Dimension?\" For a long moment, he brooded,\nabsent-minded. \"I was in the air when the black ray, which I suppose is\nAdam's deviltry, began to destroy everything it touched. From a safe\nelevation I saw it wreck all my work.\" A sudden spasm crossed his face.\n\"I've flown over the entire valley. We're the only survivors--thank\nGod!\"\n\n\"And so at last you confess that it is not well to tamper with human\nlife?\" Northwood, warmed with hot brandy, was his old self again.\n\n\"Oh, I have not altogether wasted my efforts. I went to elaborate pains\nto bring together a perfect man and a perfect woman of what Adam called\nour Black Age.\" He smiled at them whimsically.\n\n\"And who can say to what extent you have thus furthered natural\nevolution?\" Northwood slipped his arm around Athalia. \"Our children\nmight be more than geniuses, Doctor!\"\n\nDr. Mundson nodded his huge, shaggy head gravely.\n\n\"The true instinct of a Creature of the Light,\" he declared.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n  _Remember_\n  ASTOUNDING STORIES\n  _Appears on Newsstands_\n  THE FIRST THURSDAY IN EACH MONTH\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nInto Space\n\n_By Sterner St. Paul_\n\n\n    What was the extraordinary connection between Dr. Livermore's\n    sudden disappearance and the coming of a new satellite to the\n    Earth?\n\n[Illustration: _A loud hum filled the air, and suddenly the projectile\nrose, gaining speed rapidly._]\n\n\nMany of my readers will remember the mysterious radio messages which\nwere heard by both amateur and professional short wave operators during\nthe nights of the twenty-third and twenty-fourth of last September, and\neven more will remember the astounding discovery made by Professor\nMontescue of the Lick Observatory on the night of September\ntwenty-fifth. At the time, some inspired writers tried to connect the\ntwo events, maintaining that the discovery of the fact that the earth\nhad a new satellite coincident with the receipt of the mysterious\nmessages was evidence that the new planetoid was inhabited and that the\nmessages were attempts on the part of the inhabitants to communicate\nwith us.\n\nThe fact that the messages were on a lower wave length than any receiver\nthen in existence could receive with any degree of clarity, and the\nadditional fact that they appeared to come from an immense distance lent\na certain air of plausibility to these ebullitions in the Sunday\nmagazine sections. For some weeks the feature writers harped on the\nsubject, but the hurried construction of new receivers which would work\non a lower wave length yielded no results, and the solemn pronouncements\nof astronomers to the effect that the new celestial body could by no\npossibility have an atmosphere on account of its small size finally put\nan end to the talk. So the matter lapsed into oblivion.\n\nWhile quite a few people will remember the two events I have noted, I\ndoubt whether there are five hundred people alive who will remember\nanything at all about the disappearance of Dr. Livermore of the\nUniversity of Calvada on September twenty-third. He was a man of some\nlocal prominence, but he had no more than a local fame, and few papers\noutside of California even noted the event in their columns. I do not\nthink that anyone ever tried to connect up his disappearance with the\nradio messages or the discovery of the new earthly satellite; yet the\nthree events were closely bound up together, and but for the Doctor's\ndisappearance, the other two would never have happened.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Livermore taught physics at Calvada, or at least he taught the\nsubject when he remembered that he had a class and felt like teaching.\nHis students never knew whether he would appear at class or not; but he\nalways passed everyone who took his courses and so, of course, they\nwere always crowded. The University authorities used to remonstrate with\nhim, but his ability as a research worker was so well known and\nrecognized that he was allowed to go about as he pleased. He was a\nbachelor who lived alone and who had no interests in life, so far as\nanyone knew, other than his work.\n\nI first made contact with him when I was a freshman at Calvada, and for\nsome unknown reason he took a liking to me. My father had insisted that\nI follow in his footsteps as an electrical engineer; as he was paying my\nbills, I had to make a show at studying engineering while I\nclandestinely pursued my hobby, literature. Dr. Livermore's courses were\nthe easiest in the school and they counted as science, so I regularly\nregistered for them, cut them, and attended a class in literature as an\nauditor. The Doctor used to meet me on the campus and laughingly scold\nme for my absence, but he was really in sympathy with my ambition and he\nregularly gave me a passing mark and my units of credit without regard\nto my attendance, or, rather, lack of it.\n\nWhen I graduated from Calvada I was theoretically an electrical\nengineer. Practically I had a pretty good knowledge of contemporary\nliterature and knew almost nothing about my so-called profession. I\nstalled around Dad's office for a few months until I landed a job as a\ncub reporter on the San Francisco _Graphic_ and then I quit him cold.\nWhen the storm blew over, Dad admitted that you couldn't make a silk\npurse out of a sow's ear and agreed with a grunt to my new line of work.\nHe said that I would probably be a better reporter than an engineer\nbecause I couldn't by any possibility be a worse one, and let it go at\nthat. However, all this has nothing to do with the story. It just\nexplains how I came to be acquainted with Dr. Livermore, in the first\nplace, and why he sent for me on September twenty-second, in the second\nplace.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe morning of the twenty-second the City Editor called me in and asked\nme if I knew \"Old Liverpills.\"\n\n\"He says that he has a good story ready to break but he won't talk to\nanyone but you,\" went on Barnes. \"I offered to send out a good man, for\nwhen Old Liverpills starts a story it ought to be good, but all I got\nwas a high powered bawling out. He said that he would talk to you or no\none and would just as soon talk to no one as to me any longer. Then he\nhung up. You'd better take a run out to Calvada and see what he has to\nsay. I can have a good man rewrite your drivel when you get back.\"\n\nI was more or less used to that sort of talk from Barnes so I paid no\nattention to it. I drove my flivver down to Calvada and asked for the\nDoctor.\n\n\"Dr. Livermore?\" said the bursar. \"Why, he hasn't been around here for\nthe last ten months. This is his sabbatical year and he is spending it\non a ranch he owns up at Hat Creek, near Mount Lassen. You'll have to go\nthere if you want to see him.\"\n\nI knew better than to report back to Barnes without the story, so there\nwas nothing to it but to drive up to Hat Creek, and a long, hard drive\nit was. I made Redding late that night; the next day I drove on to\nBurney and asked for directions to the Doctor's ranch.\n\n\"So you're going up to Doc Livermore's, are you?\" asked the Postmaster,\nmy informant. \"Have you got an invitation?\"\n\nI assured him that I had.\n\n\"It's a good thing,\" he replied, \"because he don't allow anyone on his\nplace without one. I'd like to go up there myself and see what's going\non, but I don't want to get shot at like old Pete Johnson did when he\ntried to drop in on the Doc and pay him a little call. There's something\nmighty funny going on up there.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNaturally I tried to find out what was going on but evidently the\nPostmaster, who was also the express agent, didn't know. All he could\ntell me was that a \"lot of junk\" had come for the Doctor by express and\nthat a lot more had been hauled in by truck from Redding.\n\n\"What kind of junk?\" I asked him.\n\n\"Almost everything, Bub: sheet steel, machinery, batteries, cases of\nglass, and Lord knows what all. It's been going on ever since he landed\nthere. He has a bunch of Indians working for him and he don't let a\nwhite man on the place.\"\n\nForced to be satisfied with this meager information, I started old\nLizzie and lit out for the ranch. After I had turned off the main trail\nI met no one until the ranch house was in sight. As I rounded a bend in\nthe road which brought me in sight of the building, I was forced to put\non my brakes at top speed to avoid running into a chain which was\nstretched across the road. An Indian armed with a Winchester rifle stood\nbehind it, and when I stopped he came up and asked my business.\n\n\"My business is with Dr. Livermore,\" I said tartly.\n\n\"You got letter?\" he inquired.\n\n\"No,\" I answered.\n\n\"No ketchum letter, no ketchum Doctor,\" he replied, and walked stolidly\nback to his post.\n\n\"This is absurd,\" I shouted, and drove Lizzie up to the chain. I saw\nthat it was merely hooked to a ring at the end, and I climbed out and\nstarted to take it down. A thirty-thirty bullet embedded itself in the\npost an inch or two from my head, and I changed my mind about taking\ndown that chain.\n\n\"No ketchum letter, no ketchum Doctor,\" said the Indian laconically as\nhe pumped another shell into his gun.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was balked, until I noticed a pair of telephone wires running from the\nhouse to the tree to which one end of the chain was fastened.\n\n\"Is that a telephone to the house?\" I demanded.\n\nThe Indian grunted an assent.\n\n\"Dr. Livermore telephoned me to come and see him,\" I said. \"Can't I call\nhim up and see if he still wants to see me?\"\n\nThe Indian debated the question with himself for a minute and then\nnodded a doubtful assent. I cranked the old coffee mill type of\ntelephone which I found, and presently heard the voice of Dr. Livermore.\n\n\"This is Tom Faber, Doctor,\" I said. \"The _Graphic_ sent me up to get a\nstory from you, but there's an Indian here who started to murder me when\nI tried to get past your barricade.\"\n\n\"Good for him,\" chuckled the Doctor. \"I heard the shot, but didn't know\nthat he was shooting at you. Tell him to talk to me.\"\n\nThe Indian took the telephone at my bidding and listened for a minute.\n\n\"You go in,\" he agreed when he hung up the receiver.\n\nHe took down the chain and I drove on up to the house, to find the\nDoctor waiting for me on the veranda.\n\n\"Hello, Tom,\" he greeted me heartily. \"So you had trouble with my guard,\ndid you?\"\n\n\"I nearly got murdered,\" I said ruefully.\n\n\"I expect that Joe would have drilled you if you had tried to force your\nway in,\" he remarked cheerfully. \"I forgot to tell him that you were\ncoming to-day. I told him you would be here yesterday, but yesterday\nisn't to-day to that Indian. I wasn't sure you would get here at all, in\npoint of fact, for I didn't know whether that old fool I talked to in\nyour office would send you or some one else. If anyone else had been\nsent, he would have never got by Joe, I can tell you. Come in. Where's\nyour bag?\"\n\n\"I haven't one,\" I replied. \"I went to Calvada yesterday to see you, and\ndidn't know until I got there that you were up here.\"\n\nThe Doctor chuckled.\n\n\"I guess I forgot to tell where I was,\" he said. \"That man I talked to\ngot me so mad that I hung up on him before I told him. It doesn't\nmatter, though. I can dig you up a new toothbrush, and I guess you can\nmake out with that. Come in.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI followed him into the house, and he showed me a room fitted with a\ncrude bunk, a washstand, a bowl and a pitcher.\n\n\"You won't have many luxuries here, Tom,\" he said, \"but you won't need\nto stay here for more than a few days. My work is done: I am ready to\nstart. In fact, I would have started yesterday instead of to-day, had\nyou arrived. Now don't ask any questions; it's nearly lunch time.\"\n\n\"What's the story, Doctor?\" I asked after lunch as I puffed one of his\nexcellent cigars. \"And why did you pick me to tell it to?\"\n\n\"For several reasons,\" he replied, ignoring my first question. \"In the\nfirst place, I like you and I think that you can keep your mouth shut\nuntil you are told to open it. In the second place, I have always found\nthat you had the gift of vision or imagination and have the ability to\nbelieve. In the third place, you are the only man I know who had the\nliterary ability to write up a good story and at the same time has the\nscientific background to grasp what it is all about. Understand that\nunless I have your promise not to write this story until I tell you that\nyou can, not a word will I tell you.\"\n\nI reflected for a moment. The _Graphic_ would expect the story when I\ngot back, but on the other hand I knew that unless I gave the desired\npromise, the Doctor wouldn't talk.\n\n\"All right,\" I assented, \"I'll promise.\"\n\n\"Good!\" he replied. \"In that case, I'll tell you all about it. No doubt\nyou, like the rest of the world, think that I'm crazy?\"\n\n\"Why, not at all,\" I stammered. In point of fact, I had often harbored\nsuch a suspicion.\n\n\"Oh, that's all right,\" he went on cheerfully. \"I _am_ crazy, crazy as a\nloon, which, by the way, is a highly sensible bird with a well balanced\nmentality. There is no doubt that I am crazy, but my craziness is not of\nthe usual type. Mine is the insanity of genius.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe looked at me sharply as he spoke, but long sessions at poker in the\nSan Francisco Press Club had taught me how to control my facial muscles,\nand I never batted an eye. He seemed satisfied, and went on.\n\n\"From your college work you are familiar with the laws of magnetism,\" he\nsaid. \"Perhaps, considering just what your college career really was, I\nmight better say that you are supposed to be familiar with them.\"\n\nI joined with him in his laughter.\n\n\"It won't require a very deep knowledge to follow the thread of my\nargument,\" he went on. \"You know, of course, that the force of magnetic\nattraction is inversely proportional to the square of the distances\nseparating the magnet and the attracted particles, and also that each\nmagnetized particle had two poles, a positive and a negative pole, or a\nnorth pole and a south pole, as they are usually called?\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"Consider for a moment that the laws of magnetism, insofar as concerns\nthe relation between distance and power of attraction, are exactly\nmatched by the laws of gravitation.\"\n\n\"But there the similarity between the two forces ends,\" I interrupted.\n\n\"But there the similarity does _not_ end,\" he said sharply. \"That is the\ncrux of the discovery which I have made: that magnetism and gravity are\none and the same, or, rather, that the two are separate, but similar\nmanifestations of one force. The parallel between the two grows closer\nwith each succeeding experiment. You know, for example, that each\nmagnetized particle has two poles. Similarly each gravitized particle,\nto coin a new word, had two poles, one positive and one negative. Every\nparticle on the earth is so oriented that the negative poles point\ntoward the positive center of the earth. This is what causes the\ncommonly known phenomena of gravity or weight.\"\n\n\"I can prove the fallacy of that in a moment,\" I retorted.\n\n\"There are none so blind as those who will not see,\" he quoted with an\nicy smile. \"I can probably predict your puerile argument, but go ahead\nand present it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"If two magnets are placed so that the north pole of one is in\njuxtaposition to the south pole of the other, they attract one another,\"\nI said. \"If the position of the magnets be reversed so that the two\nsimilar poles are opposite, they will repel. If your theory were\ncorrect, a man standing on his head would fall off the earth.\"\n\n\"Exactly what I expected,\" he replied. \"Now let me ask you a question.\nHave you ever seen a small bar magnet placed within the field of\nattraction of a large electromagnet? Of course you have, and you have\nnoticed that, when the north pole of the bar magnet was pointed toward\nthe electromagnet, the bar was attracted. However, when the bar was\nreversed and the south pole pointed toward the electromagnet, the bar\nwas still attracted. You doubtless remember that experiment.\"\n\n\"But in that case the magnetism of the electromagnet was so large that\nthe polarity of the small magnet was reversed!\" I cried.\n\n\"Exactly, and the field of gravity of the earth is so great compared to\nthe gravity of a man that when he stands on his head, his polarity is\ninstantly reversed.\"\n\nI nodded. His explanation was too logical for me to pick a flaw in it.\n\n\"If that same bar magnet were held in the field of the electromagnet\nwith its north pole pointed toward the magnet and then, by the action of\nsome outside force of sufficient power, its polarity were reversed, the\nbar would be repelled. If the magnetism were neutralized and held\nexactly neutral, it would be neither repelled nor attracted, but would\nact only as the force of gravity impelled it. Is that clear?\"\n\n\"Perfectly,\" I assented.\n\n\"That, then, paves the way for what I have to tell you. I have\ndeveloped an electrical method of neutralizing the gravity of a body\nwhile it is within the field of the earth, and also, by a slight\nextension, a method of entirely reversing its polarity.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI nodded calmly.\n\n\"Do you realize what this means?\" he cried.\n\n\"No,\" I replied, puzzled by his great excitement.\n\n\"Man alive,\" he cried, \"it means that the problem of aerial flight is\nentirely revolutionized, and that the era of interplanetary travel is at\nhand! Suppose that I construct an airship and then render it neutral to\ngravity. It would weigh nothing, _absolutely nothing_! The tiniest\npropeller would drive it at almost incalculable speed with a minimum\nconsumption of power, for the only resistance to its motion would be the\nresistance of the air. If I were to reverse the polarity, it would be\nrepelled from the earth with the same force with which it is now\nattracted, and it would rise with the same acceleration as a body falls\ntoward the earth. It would travel to the moon in two hours and forty\nminutes.\"\n\n\"Air resistance would--\"\n\n\"There is no air a few miles from the earth. Of course, I do not mean\nthat such a craft would take off from the earth and land on the moon\nthree hours later. There are two things which would interfere with that.\nOne is the fact that the propelling force, the gravity of the earth,\nwould diminish as the square of the distance from the center of the\nearth, and the other is that when the band of neutral attraction, or\nrather repulsion, between the earth and the moon had been reached, it\nwould be necessary to decelerate so as to avoid a smash on landing. I\nhave been over the whole thing and I find that it would take twenty-nine\nhours and fifty-two minutes to make the whole trip. The entire thing is\nperfectly possible. In fact, I have asked you here to witness and report\nthe first interplanetary trip to be made.\"\n\n\"Have you constructed such a device?\" I cried.\n\n\"My space ship is finished and ready for your inspection,\" he replied.\n\"If you will come with me, I will show it to you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHardly knowing what to believe, I followed him from the house and to a\nhuge barnlike structure, over a hundred feet high, which stood nearby.\nHe opened the door and switched on a light, and there before me stood\nwhat looked at first glance to be a huge artillery shell, but of a size\nlarger than any ever made. It was constructed of sheet steel, and while\nthe lower part was solid, the upper sections had huge glass windows set\nin them. On the point was a mushroom shaped protuberance. It measured\nperhaps fifty feet in diameter and was one hundred and forty feet high,\nthe Doctor informed me. A ladder led from the floor to a door about\nfifty feet from the ground.\n\nI followed the Doctor up the ladder and into the space flier. The door\nled us into a comfortable living room through a double door arrangement.\n\n\"The whole hull beneath us,\" explained the Doctor, \"is filled with\nbatteries and machinery except for a space in the center, where a shaft\nleads to a glass window in the bottom so that I can see behind me, so to\nspeak. The space above is filled with storerooms and the air purifying\napparatus. On this level is my bedroom, kitchen, and other living rooms,\ntogether with a laboratory and an observatory. There is a central\ncontrol room located on an upper level, but it need seldom be entered,\nfor the craft can be controlled by a system of relays from this room or\nfrom any other room in the ship. I suppose that you are more or less\nfamiliar with imaginative stories of interplanetary travel?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI nodded an assent.\n\n\"In that case there is no use in going over the details of the air\npurifying and such matters,\" he said. \"The story writers have worked\nout all that sort of thing in great detail, and there is nothing novel\nin my arrangements. I carry food and water for six months and air enough\nfor two months by constant renovating. Have you any question you wish to\nask?\"\n\n\"One objection I have seen frequently raised to the idea of\ninterplanetary travel is that the human body could not stand the rapid\nacceleration which would be necessary to attain speed enough to ever get\nanywhere. How do you overcome this?\"\n\n\"My dear boy, who knows what the human body can stand? When the\nlocomotive was first invented learned scientists predicted that the\nlimit of speed was thirty miles an hour, as the human body could not\nstand a higher speed. To-day the human body stands a speed of three\nhundred and sixty miles an hour without ill effects. At any rate, on my\nfirst trip I intend to take no chances. We know that the body can stand\nan acceleration of thirty-two feet per second without trouble. That is\nthe rate of acceleration due to gravity and is the rate at which a body\nincreases speed when it falls. This is the acceleration which I will\nuse.\n\n\"Remember that the space traveled by a falling body in a vacuum is equal\nto one half the acceleration multiplied by the square of the elapsed\ntime. The moon, to which I intend to make my first trip, is only 280,000\nmiles, or 1,478,400,000 feet, from us. With an acceleration of\nthirty-two feet per second, I would pass the moon two hours and forty\nminutes after leaving the earth. If I later take another trip, say to\nMars, I will have to find a means of increasing my acceleration,\npossibly by the use of the rocket principle. Then will be time enough to\nworry about what my body will stand.\"\n\nA short calculation verified the figures the Doctor had given me, and I\nstood convinced.\n\n\"Are you really going?\" I asked.\n\n\"Most decidedly. To repeat, I would have started yesterday, had you\narrived. As it is, I am ready to start at once. We will go back to the\nhouse for a few minutes while I show you the location of an excellent\ntelescope through which you may watch my progress, and instruct you in\nthe use of an ultra-short-wave receiver which I am confident will pierce\nthe Heaviside layer. With this I will keep in communication with you,\nalthough I have made no arrangements for you to send messages to me on\nthis trip. I intend to go to the moon and land. I will take atmosphere\nsamples through an air port and, if there is an atmosphere which will\nsupport life, I will step out on the surface. If there is not, I will\nreturn to the earth.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA few minutes was enough for me to grasp the simple manipulations which\nI would have to perform, and I followed him again to the space flier.\n\n\"How are you going to get it out?\" I asked.\n\n\"Watch,\" he said.\n\nHe worked some levers and the roof of the barn folded back, leaving the\nway clear for the departure of the huge projectile. I followed him\ninside and he climbed the ladder.\n\n\"When I shut the door, go back to the house and test the radio,\" he\ndirected.\n\nThe door clanged shut and I hastened into the house. His voice came\nplainly enough. I went back to the flier and waved him a final farewell,\nwhich he acknowledged through a window; then I returned to the receiver.\nA loud hum filled the air, and suddenly the projectile rose and flew out\nthrough the open roof, gaining speed rapidly until it was a mere speck\nin the sky. It vanished. I had no trouble in picking him up with the\ntelescope. In fact, I could see the Doctor through one of the windows.\n\n\"I have passed beyond the range of the atmosphere, Tom,\" came his voice\nover the receiver, \"and I find that everything is going exactly as it\nshould. I feel no discomfort, and my only regret is that I did not\ninstall a transmitter in the house so that you could talk to me; but\nthere is no real necessity for it. I am going to make some observations\nnow, but I will call you again with a report of progress in\nhalf-an-hour.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor the rest of the afternoon and all of that night I received his\nmessages regularly, but with the coming of daylight they began to fade.\nBy nine o'clock I could get only a word here and there. By noon I could\nhear nothing. I went to sleep hoping that the night would bring better\nreception, nor was I disappointed. About eight o'clock I received a\nmessage, rather faintly, but none the less distinctly.\n\n\"I regret more than ever that I did not install a transmitter so that I\ncould learn from you whether you are receiving my messages,\" his voice\nsaid faintly. \"I have no idea of whether you can hear me or not, but I\nwill keep on repeating this message every hour while my battery holds\nout. It is now thirty hours since I left the earth and I should be on\nthe moon, according to my calculations. But I am not, and never will be.\nI am caught at the neutral point where the gravity of the earth and the\nmoon are exactly equal.\n\n\"I had relied on my momentum to carry me over this point. Once over it,\nI expected to reverse my polarity and fall on the moon. My momentum did\nnot do so. If I keep my polarity as it was when left the earth, both the\nearth and the moon repel me. If I reverse it, they both attract me, and\nagain I cannot move. If I had equipped my space flier with a rocket so\nthat I could move a few miles, or even a few feet, from the dead line, I\ncould proceed, but I did not do so, and I cannot move forward or back.\nApparently I am doomed to stay here until my air gives out. Then my\nbody, entombed in my space ship, will endlessly circle the earth as a\nsatellite until the end of time. There is no hope for me, for long\nbefore a duplicate of my device equipped with rockets could be\nconstructed and come to my rescue, my air would be exhausted. Good-by,\nTom. You may write your story as soon as you wish. I will repeat my\nmessage in one hour. Good-by!\"\n\nAt nine and at ten o'clock the message was repeated. At eleven it\nstarted again but after a few sentences the sound suddenly ceased and\nthe receiver went dead. I thought that the fault was with the receiver\nand I toiled feverishly the rest of the night, but without result. I\nlearned later that the messages heard all over the world ceased at the\nsame hour.\n\nThe next morning Professor Montescue announced his discovery of the\nworld's new satellite.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n  _Coming_--\n  MURDER MADNESS\n  _An Extraordinary Four-Part Novel_\n\n  _By_ MURRAY LEINSTER\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nThe Beetle Horde\n\n_By Victor Rousseau_\n\n\n    Bullets, shrapnel, shell--nothing can stop the trillions of\n    famished, man-sized beetles which, led by a madman, sweep down\n    over the human race.\n\n[Illustration: _The hideous monsters leaped into the cockpits and began\ntheir abominable meal._]\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nTommy Travers and James Dodd, of the Travers Antarctic Expedition, crash\nin their plane somewhere near the South Pole, and are seized by a swarm\nof man-sized beetles. They are carried down to Submundia, a world under\nthe earth's crust, where the beetles have developed their civilization\nto an amazing point, using a wretched race of degenerated humans, whom\nthey breed as cattle, for food.\n\nThe insect horde is ruled by a human from the outside world--a\ndrug-doped madman. Dodd recognizes this man as Bram, the archaeologist\nwho had been lost years before at the Pole and given up for dead by a\nworld he had hated because it refused to accept his radical scientific\ntheories. His fiendish mind now plans the horrible revenge of leading\nhis unconquerable horde of monster insects forth to ravage the world,\ndestroy the human race and establish a new era--the era of the insect.\n\nThe world has to be warned of the impending doom. The two, with Haidia,\na girl of Submundia, escape, and pass through menacing dangers to within\ntwo miles of the exit. There, suddenly, Tommy sees towering over him a\ncreature that turns his blood cold--a gigantic praying mantis. Before he\nhas time to act, the monster springs at them!\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n_Through the Inferno_\n\nFortunately, the monster miscalculated its leap. The huge legs, whirling\nthrough the air, came within a few inches of Tommy's head, but passed\nover him, and the mantis plunged into the stream. Instantly the water\nwas alive with leaping things with faces of such grotesque horror that\nTommy sat paralyzed in his rocking shell, unable to avert his eyes.\n\nThings no more than a foot or two in length, to judge from the slender,\neel-like bodies that leaped into the air, but things with catfish heads\nand tentacles, and eyes waving on stalks; things with clawlike\nappendages to their ventral fins, and mouths that widened to fearful\nsize, so that the whole head seemed to disappear above them, disclosing\nfangs like wolves'. Instantly the water was churned into phosphorescent\nfire as they precipitated themselves upon the struggling mantis, whose\nenormous form, extending halfway from shore to shore, was covered with\nthe river monsters, gnawing, rending, tearing.\n\nLuckily the struggles of the dying monster carried it downstream instead\nof up. In a few moments the immediate danger was past. And suddenly\nHaidia awoke, sat up.\n\n\"Where are we?\" she cried. \"Oh, I can see! I can see! Something has\nburned away from my eyes! I know this place. A wise man of my people\nonce came here, and returned to tell of it. We must go on. Soon we shall\nbe safe on the wide river. But there is another way that leads to here.\nWe must go on! We must go on!\"\n\nEven as she spoke they heard the distant rasping of the beetle-legs. And\nbefore the shells were well in mid-current they saw the beetle horde\ncoming round the bend; in the front of them Bram, reclining on his shell\ncouch, and drawn by the eight trained beetles.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBram saw the fugitives, and a roar of ironic mirth broke from his lips,\nresounding high above the strident rasping of the beetle-legs, and\nroaring over the marshes.\n\n\"I've got you, Dodd and Travers,\" he bellowed, as the trained beetles\nhovered above the shell canoes. \"You thought you were clever, but you're\nat my mercy. Now's your last chance, Dodd. I'll save you still if you'll\nsubmit to me, if you'll admit that there were fossil monotremes before\nthe pleistocene epoch. Come, it's so simple! Say it after me: 'The\nmarsupial lion--'\"\n\n\"You go to hell!\" yelled Dodd, nearly upsetting his shell as he shook\nhis fist at his enemy.\n\nHigh above the rasping sound came Bram's shrill whistle. Just audible to\nhuman ears, though probably sounding like the roar of thunder to those\nof the beetles, there was no need to wonder what it was.\n\nIt was the call to slaughter.\n\nLike a black cloud the beetles shot forward. A serried phalanx covered\nthe two men and the girl, hovering a few feet overhead, the long legs\ndangling to within arm's reach. And a terrible cry of fear broke from\nHaidia's lips.\n\nSuddenly Tommy remembered Bram's cigarette-lighter. He pulled it from\nhis pocket and ignited it.\n\nSmall as the flame was, it was actinically much more powerful than the\nbrighter phosphorescence of the fungi behind them. The beetle-cloud\noverhead parted. The strident sound was broken into a confused buzzing\nas the terrified, blinded beetles plopped into the stream.\n\nNone of them, fortunately, fell into either of the three shells, but the\nmass of struggling monsters in the water was hardly less formidable to\nthe safety of the occupants than that menacing cloud overhead.\n\n\"Get clear!\" Tommy yelled to Dodd, trying to help the shell along with\nhis hands.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe heard Bram's cry of baffled rage, and, looking backward, could not\nrefrain from a laugh of triumph. Bram's trained steeds had taken fright\nand overset him. Bram had fallen into the red mud beside the stream,\nfrom which he was struggling up, plastered from head to feet, and\nshaking his fists and evidently cursing, though his words could not be\nheard.\n\n\"How about your marsupial lion now, Bram?\" yelled Dodd. \"No monotremes\nbefore the pleistocene! D'you get that? That's my slogan now and for\never more!\"\n\nBram shrieked and raved, and seemed to be inciting the beetles to a\nrenewed assault. The air was still thick with them, but Tommy was waving\nthe cigarette-lighter in a flaming arc, which cleared the way for them.\n\nThen suddenly came disaster. The flame went out! Tommy closed the\nlighter with a snap and opened it. In vain. In his excitement he must\nhave spilled all the contents, for it would not catch.\n\nBram saw and yelled derision. The beetle-cloud was thickening. Tommy,\nnow abreast of his companions on the widening stream, saw the imminent\nend.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd then once more fate intervened. For, leaping through the air out of\nthe places where they had lain concealed, six mantises launched\nthemselves at their beetle prey.\n\nThose awful bounds of the long-legged monsters, the scourges of the\ninsect world, carried them clear from one bank to the other--fortunately\nfor the occupants of the shells. In an instant the beetle-cloud\ndissolved. And it had all happened in a few seconds. Before Dodd or\nTommy had quite taken in the situation, the mantises, each carrying a\nvictim in its grooved legs, had vanished like the beetles. There was no\nsign of Bram. The three were alone upon the face of the stream, which\nwent swirling upward into renewed darkness.\n\nTommy saw Dodd bend toward Haidia as she lay on her shell couch. He\nheard the sound of a noisy kiss. And he lay back in the hollow of his\nshell, with the feeling that nothing that could happen in the future\ncould be worse than what they had passed through.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDays went by, days when the sense of dawning freedom filled their hearts\nwith hope. Haidia told Dodd and Tommy that, according to the legends of\nher people, the river ran into the world from which they had been driven\nby the floods, ages before.\n\nThere had been no further signs of Bram or the beetle horde, and Dodd\nand Tommy surmised that it had been disorganized by the attack of the\nmantises, and that Bram was engaged in regaining his control over it.\nBut neither of them believed that the respite would be a long one, and\nfor that reason they rested ashore only for the briefest intervals, just\nlong enough to snatch a little sleep, and to eat some of the shrimps\nthat Haidia was adept at finding--or to pull some juicy fruit\nsurreptitiously from a tree.\n\nIncidents there were, nevertheless, during those days. For hours their\nshells were followed by a school of the luminous river monsters, which,\nnevertheless, made no attempt to attack them. And once, hearing a cry\nfrom Haidia, as she was gathering shrimps, Dodd ran forward to see her\nbattling furiously with a luminous scorpion, eight feet in length, that\nhad sprung at her from its lurking place behind a pear shrub.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDodd succeeded in stunning and dispatching the monster without suffering\nany injury from it, but the strain of the period was beginning to tell\non all of them. Worst of all, they seemed to have left all the luminous\nvegetation behind them, and were entering a region of almost total\ndarkness, in which Haidia had to be their eyes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSomething had happened to the girl's sight in the journey over the\npetrol spring. As a matter of fact, the third, or nictitating membrane,\nwhich the humans of Submundia possessed, in common with birds, had been\nburned away. Haidia could see as well as ever in the dark, but she could\nbear more light than formerly as well. Unobtrusively she assumed command\nof the party. She anticipated their wants, dug shrimps in the darkness,\nand fed Tommy and Dodd with her own hands.\n\n\"God, what a girl!\" breathed Dodd to his friend. \"I've always had the\nreputation of being a woman-hater, Tommy, but once I get that girl to\ncivilization I'm going to take her to the nearest Little Church Around\nthe Corner in record time.\"\n\n\"I wish you luck, old man, I'm sure,\" answered Tommy. Dodd's words did\nnot seem strange to him. Civilization was growing very remote to him,\nand Broadway seemed like a memory of some previous incarnation.\n\nThe river was growing narrower again, and swifter, too. On the last day,\nor night, of their journey--though they did not know that it was to be\ntheir last--it swirled so fiercely that it threatened every moment to\noverset their beetle-shells. Suddenly Tommy began to feel giddy. He\ngripped the side of his shell with his hand.\n\n\"Tommy, we're going round!\" shouted Dodd in front of him.\n\nThere was no longer any doubt of it. The shells were revolving in a\nvortex of rushing, foaming water.\n\n\"Haidia!\" they shouted.\n\nThe girl's voice came back thickly across the roaring torrent. The\ncircles grew smaller. Tommy knew that he was being sucked nearer and\nnearer to the edge of some terrific whirlpool in that inky blackness.\nNow he could no longer hear Dodd's shouts, and the shell was tipping so\nthat he could feel the water rushing along the edge of it. But for the\nexercise of centrifugal force he would have been flung from his perilous\nseat, for he was leaning inward at an angle of forty-five degrees.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen suddenly his progress was arrested. He felt the shell being drawn\nto the shore. He leaped out, and Haidia's strong hands dragged the shell\nout of the torrent, while Tommy sank down, gasping.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" he heard Dodd demanding.\n\n\"There is no more river,\" said Haidia calmly. \"It goes into a hole in\nthe ground. So much I have heard from the wise men of my people. They\nsay that it is near such a place that they fled from the flood in years\ngone by.\"\n\n\"Then we're near safety,\" shouted Tommy. \"That river must emerge as a\nstream somewhere in the upper world, Dodd. I wonder where the road\nlies.\"\n\n\"There is a road here,\" came Haidia's calm voice. \"Let us put on our\nshells again, since who knows whether there may not be beetles here.\"\n\n\"Did you ever see such a girl as that?\" demanded Dodd ecstatically.\n\"First she saves our lives, and then she thinks of everything. Good\nlord, she'll remember my meals, and to wind my watch for me, and--and--\"\n\nBut Haidia's voice, some distance ahead, interrupted Dodd's soliloquy,\nand, hoisting the beetle-shells upon their backs, they started along the\nrough trail that they could feel with their feet over the stony ground.\nIt was still as dark as pitch, but soon they found themselves traveling\nup a sunken way that was evidently a dry watercourse. And now and again\nHaidia's reassuring voice would come from in front of them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe road grew steeper. There could no longer be any doubt that they were\nascending toward the surface of the earth. But even the weight of the\nbeetle-shells and the steepness could not account for the feeling of\nintense weakness that took possession of them. Time and again they\nstopped, panting.\n\n\"We must be very near the surface, Dodd,\" said Tommy. \"We've surely\npassed the center of gravity. That's what makes it so difficult.\"\n\n\"Come on,\" Haidia said in her quiet voice, stretching out her hand\nthrough the darkness. And for very shame they had to follow her.\n\nOn and on, hour after hour, up the steep ascent, resting only long\nenough to make them realize their utter fatigue. On because Haidia was\nleading them, and because in the belief that they were about to leave\nthat awful land behind them their desires lent new strength to their\nlimbs continuously.\n\nSuddenly Haidia uttered a fearful cry. Her ears had caught what became\napparent to Dodd and Jimmy several seconds later.\n\nFar down in the hollow of the earth, increased by the echoes that came\nrumbling up, they heard the distant, strident rasp of the beetle swarm.\n\nThen it was Dodd's turn to support Haidia and whisper consolation in her\nears. No thought of resting now. If they were to be overwhelmed at last\nby the monsters, they meant to be overwhelmed in the upper air.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was growing insufferably hot. Blasts of air, as if from a furnace,\nbegan to rush up and down past them. And the trail was growing steeper\nstill, and slippery as glass.\n\n\"What is it, Jim?\" Tommy panted, as Dodd, leaving Haidia for a moment,\ncame back to him.\n\n\"I'd say lava,\" Dodd answered. \"If only one could see something! I don't\nknow how she finds her way. My impression is that we are coming out\nthrough the interior of an extinct volcano.\"\n\n\"But where are there volcanoes in the south polar regions?\" inquired\nTommy.\n\n\"There are Mount Erebus and Mount Terror, in South Victoria Land, active\nvolcanoes discovered by Sir James Ross in 1841, and again by\nBorchgrevink, in 1899. If that's where we're coming out--well, Tommy,\nwe're doomed, because it's the heart of the polar continent. We might as\nwell turn back.\"\n\n\"But we won't turn back,\" said Tommy. \"I'm damned if we do.\"\n\n\"We're damned if we don't,\" said Dodd.\n\n\"Come along please!\" sang Haidia's voice high up the slope.\n\nThey struggled on. And now a faint luminosity was beginning to penetrate\nthat infernal darkness. The rasping of the beetle-legs, too, was no\nlonger audible. Perhaps they had thrown Bram off their track! Perhaps in\nthe darkness he had not known which way they had gone after leaving the\nwhirlpool!\n\nThat thought encouraged them to a last effort. They pushed their\nflagging limbs up, upward through an inferno of heated air. Suddenly\nDodd uttered a yell and pointed upward.\n\n\"God!\" ejaculated Tommy. Then he seized Dodd in his arms and nearly\ncrushed him. For high above them, a pin-point in the black void, they\nsaw--a star!\n\nThey were almost at the earth's surface!\n\nOne more effort, and suddenly the ground seemed to give beneath them.\nThey breathed the outer air, and went sliding down a chute of sand, and\nstopped, half buried, at the bottom.\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n_Recaptured_\n\n\"Where are we?\" each demanded of the other, as they staggered out.\n\nIt was a moonless night, and the air was chill, but they were certainly\nnowhere near the polar regions, for there was no trace of snow to be\nseen anywhere. All about them was sand, with here and there a spiny\nshrub standing up stiff and erect and solitary.\n\nWhen they had disengaged themselves from the clinging sand they could\nsee that they were apparently in the hollow of a vast crater, that must\nhave been half a mile in circumference. It was low and worn down to an\nelevation of not more than two or three hundred feet, and evidently the\nvolcano that had thrown it up had been extinct for millennia.\n\n\"Water!\" gasped Dodd.\n\nThey looked all about them. They could see no signs of a spring\nanywhere, and both were parched with thirst after their terrific climb.\n\n\"We must find water, Haidia,\" said Tommy. \"Why, what's the matter?\"\n\nHaidia was pointing upward at the starry heaven, and shivering with\nfear. \"Eyes!\" she cried. \"Big beetles waiting for us up there!\"\n\n\"No, no, Haidia,\" Dodd explained. \"Those are stars. They are\nworlds--places where people live.\"\n\n\"Will you take me up there?\" asked Haidia.\n\n\"No, this is our world,\" said Dodd. \"And by and by the sun will rise,\nthat's a big ball of fire up there. He watches over the world and gives\nus light and warmth. Don't be afraid. I'll take care of you.\"\n\n\"Haidia is not afraid with Jimmydodd to take care of her,\" replied the\ngirl with dignity. \"Haidia smells water--over there.\" She pointed across\none side of the crater.\n\n\"There we'd better hurry,\" said Tommy, \"because I can't hold out much\nlonger.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe three scrambled over the soft sand, which sucked in their feet to\nthe ankle at every step. It was with the greatest difficulty that they\nsucceeded in reaching the crater's summit, low though it was. Then Dodd\nuttered a cry, and pointed. In front of them extended a long pool of\nwater, with a scrubby growth around the edges.\n\nThe ground was firmer here, and they hurried toward it. Tommy was the\nfirst to reach it. He lay down on his face and drank eagerly. He had\ntaken in a quart before he discovered that the water was saline.\n\nAt the same time Dodd uttered an exclamation of disgust. Haidia, too,\nafter sipping a little of the fluid, had stood up, chattering excitedly\nin her own language.\n\nBut she was not chattering about the water. She was pointing toward the\nscrub. \"Men there!\" she cried. \"Men like you and Tommy, Jimmydodd.\"\n\nTommy and Dodd looked at each other, the water already forgotten in\ntheir excitement at Haidia's information, which neither of them doubted.\n\nBrave as she was, the girl now hung back behind Dodd, letting the two\nmen take precedence of her. The water, saline as it was, had partly\nquenched their thirst. They felt their strength reviving.\n\nAnd it was growing light. In the east the sky was already flecked with\nyellow pink. They felt a thrill of intense excitement at the prospect of\nmeeting others of their kind.\n\n\"Where do you think we are?\" asked Tommy.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDodd stopped to look at a shrub that was growing near the edge of the\npool. \"I don't think, I know, Tommy,\" he answered. \"This is wattle.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"We're somewhere in the interior regions of the Australian\ncontinent--and that's not going to help us much.\"\n\n\"Over there--over there,\" panted Haidia. \"Hold me, Jimmydodd. I can't\nsee. Ah, this terrible light!\"\n\nShe screwed her eyelids tightly together to shut out the pale light of\ndawn. The men had already discovered that the third membrane had been\nburned away.\n\n\"We must get her out of here,\" whispered Dodd to Tommy. \"Somewhere where\nit's dark, before the sun rises. Let's go back to the entrance of the\ncrater.\"\n\nBut Haidia, her arm extended, persisted, \"Over there! Over there!\"\n\nSuddenly a spear came whirling out of a growth of wattle beside the\npool. It whizzed past Tommy's face and dropped into the sand behind.\nBetween the trunks of the wattles they could see the forms of a party of\nblackfellows, watching them intently.\n\nTommy held up his arms and moved forward with a show of confidence that\nhe was far from feeling. After what he had escaped in the underworld he\nwas in no mood to be massacred now.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut the blacks were evidently not hostile. It was probable that the\nspear had not been aimed to kill. At the sight of the two white men, and\nthe white woman, they came forward doubtfully, then more fearlessly,\nshouting in their language. In another minute Tommy and Dodd were the\ncenter of a group of wondering savages.\n\nEspecially Haidia. Three or four gins, or black women, had crept out of\nthe scrub, and were already examining her with guttural cries, and\nfingering the hair garment that she wore.\n\n\"Water!\" said Tommy, pointing to his throat, and then to the pool, with\na frown of disgust.\n\nThe blackfellows grinned, and led the three a short distance to a place\nwhere a large hollow had been scooped in the sandy floor of the desert.\nIt was full of water, perfectly sweet to the taste. The three drank\ngratefully.\n\nSuddenly the edge of the sun appeared above the horizon, gilding the\nsand with gold. The sunlight fell upon the three, and Haidia uttered a\nterrible cry of distress. She dropped upon the sand, her hands pressed\nto her eyes convulsively. Tommy and Dodd dragged her into the thickest\npart of the scrub, where she lay moaning.\n\nThey contrived bandages from the remnants of their clothing, and these,\ndamped with cold water, and bound over the girl's eyes, alleviated her\nsuffering somewhat. Meanwhile the blackfellows had prepared a meal of\nroast opossum. After their long diet of shrimps, it tasted like ambrosia\nto the two men.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMuch to their surprise, Haidia seemed to enjoy it too. The three\nsquatted in the scrub among the friendly blacks, discussing their\nsituation.\n\n\"These fellows will save us,\" said Dodd. \"It may be that we're quite\nnear the coast, but, any way, they'll stick to us, even if only out of\ncuriosity. They'll take us somewhere. But as soon as we get Haidia to\nsafety we'll have to go back along our trail. We mustn't lose our\ndirection. Suppose I was laughed at when I get back, called a liar! I\ntell you, we've got to have something to show, to prove my statements,\nbefore I can persuade anybody to fit out an expedition into Submundia.\nEven those three beetle-shells that we dropped in the crater won't be\nconclusive evidence for the type of mind that sits in the chairs of\nscience to-day. And, speaking of that, we must get those blacks to carry\nthose shells for us. I tell you, nobody will believe--\"\n\n\"What's that?\" cried Tommy sharply, as a rasping sound rose above the\ncries of the frightened blacks.\n\nBut there was no need to ask. Out of the crater two enormous beetles\nwere winging their way toward them, two beetles larger than any that\nthey had seen.\n\nFully seven feet in length, they were circling about each other,\napparently engaged in a vicious battle.\n\nThe fearful beaks stabbed at the flesh beneath the shells, and they\nalternately stabbed and drew back, all the while approaching the party,\nwhich watched them, petrified with terror.\n\nIt was evident that the monsters had no conception of the presence of\nhumans. Blinded by the sun, only one thing could have induced them to\nleave the dark depths of Submundia. That was the mating instinct. The\nbeetles were evidently rival leaders of some swarm, engaged in a duel to\nthe death.\n\nRound and round they went in a dizzy maze, stabbing and thrusting, jaws\nclosing on flesh, until they dropped, close-locked in battle, not more\nthan twenty feet from the little party of blacks and whites, both\nsquirming in the agonies of death.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I don't think that necessarily means that the swarm is on our trail,\"\nsaid Tommy, a little later, as the three stood beside the shells that\nthey had discarded. \"Those two were strays, lost from the swarm and\nmaddened by the mating instinct. Still, it might be as well to wear\nthese things for a while, in case they do follow us.\"\n\n\"You're right,\" answered Dodd, as he placed one of the shells around\nHaidia. \"We've got to get this little lady to civilization, and we've\ngot to protect our lives in order to give this great new knowledge to\nthe world. If we are attacked, you must sacrifice your life for me,\nTommy, so that I can carry back the news.\"\n\n\"Righto!\" answered Tommy with alacrity. \"You bet I will, Jim.\"\n\nThe glaring sun of mid-afternoon was shining down upon the desert, but\nHaidia was no longer in pain. It was evident that she was fast becoming\naccustomed to the sunlight, though she still kept her eyes screwed up\ntightly, and had to be helped along by Dodd and Jimmy. In high good\nhumor the three reached the encampment, to find that the blacks were\nfeasting on the dead beetles, while the two eldest members of the party\nhad proudly donned the shells.\n\nIt was near sunset before they finally started. Dodd and Tommy had\nmanaged to make it clear to them that they wished to reach civilization,\nbut how near this was there was, of course, no means of determining.\nThey noted, however, that the party started in a southerly direction.\n\n\"I should say,\" said Dodd, \"that we are in South Australia, probably\nthree or four hundred miles from the coast. We've got a long journey\nbefore us, but these blackfellows will know how to procure food for us.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey certainly knew how to get water, for, just as it began to grow\ndark, when the three were already tormented by thirst, they stopped at\nwhat seemed a mere hollow among the stones and boulders that strewed the\nface of the desert, and scooped away the sand, leaving a hole which\nquickly filled with clear, cold water of excellent taste.\n\nAfter which they made signs that they were to camp there for the night.\nThe moon was riding high in the sky. As it grew dark, Haidia opened her\neyes, saw the luminary, and uttered an exclamation, this time not of\nfear, but of wonder.\n\n\"Moon,\" said Dodd. \"That's all right, girl. She watches over the night,\nas the sun does over the day.\"\n\n\"Haidia likes the moon better than the sun,\" said the girl wistfully.\n\"But the moon not strong enough to keep away the beetles.\"\n\n\"If I was you, I'd forget about the beetles, Haidia,\" said Dodd. \"They\nwon't come out of that hole in the ground. You'll never see them again.\"\n\nAnd, as he spoke, they heard a familiar rasping sound far in the\ndistance.\n\n\"How the wind blows,\" said Tommy, desperately resolved not to believe\nhis ears. \"I think a storm's coming up.\"\n\nBut Haidia, with a scream of fear, was clinging to Dodd, and the blacks\nwere on their feet, spears and boomerangs in their hands, looking\nnorthward.\n\nOut of that north a little black cloud was gathering. A cloud that\nspread gradually, as a thunder-cloud, until it covered a good part of\nthe sky. And still more of the sky, and still more. All the while that\nfaint, distant rasping was audible, but it did not increase in volume.\nIt was as if the beetles had halted until the full number of the swarm\nhad come up out of the crater.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen the cloud, which by now covered half the sky, began to take\ngeometric form. It grew square, the ragged edges seemed to trim\nthemselves away, streaks of light shot through it at right angles, as if\nit was marshaling itself into companies.\n\nThe doomed men and the girl stood perfectly still, staring at that\nphenomenon. They knew that only a miracle could save them. They did not\neven speak, but Haidia clung more tightly to Dodd's arm.\n\nThen suddenly the cloud spread upward and covered the face of the moon.\n\n\"Well, this is good-by, Tommy,\" said Dodd, gripping his friend's hand.\n\"God, I wish I had a revolver, or a knife!\" He looked at Haidia.\n\nSuddenly the rasping became a whining shriek. A score of enormous\nbeetles, the advance guards of the army, zoomed out of the darkness into\na ray of straggling moonlight. Shrieking, the blacks, who had watched\nthe approaching swarm perfectly immobile, threw away the two shells and\nbolted.\n\n\"Good Lord,\" Dodd shouted, \"did you see the color of their shells,\nTommy?\" Even in that moment the scientific observer came uppermost in\nhim. \"Those red edges? They must be young ones, Tommy. It's the new\nbrood! No wonder Bram stayed behind! He was waiting for them to hatch!\nThe new brood! We're doomed--doomed! All my work wasted!\"\n\nThe blackfellows did not get very far. A hundred yards from the place\nwhere they started to run they dropped, their bodies hidden beneath the\nclustering monsters, their screams cut short as those frightful beaks\nsought their throats, and those jaws crunched through flesh and bone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCircling around Dodd, Tommy, and Haidia, as if puzzled by their\nappearance, the beetles kept up a continuous, furious droning that\nsounded like the roar of Niagara mixed with the shrieking of a thousand\nsirens. The moon was completely hidden, and only a dim, nebulous light\nshowed the repulsive monsters as they flew within a few feet of the\nheads of the fugitives. The stench was overpowering.\n\nBut suddenly a ray of white light shot through the darkness, and, with a\nchanged note, just perceptible to the ears of the two men, but doubtless\nof the greatest significance to the beetles, the swarm fled apart to\nright and left, leaving a clear lane, through which appeared--Bram,\nreclining on his shell-couch above his eight trained beetle steeds!\n\nHovering overhead, the eight huge monsters dropped lightly to the ground\nbeside the three. Bram sat up, a vicious grin upon his twisted face. In\nhis hand he held a large electric bulb, its sides sheathed in a roughly\ncarved wooden frame; the wire was attached to a battery behind him.\n\n\"Well met, my friends!\" he shouted exultantly. \"I owe you more thanks\nthan I can express for having so providentially left the electrical\nequipment of your plane undamaged after you crashed at the entrance to\nSubmundia. I had a hunch about it--and the hunch worked!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe grinned more malevolently as he looked from one man to the other.\n\n\"You've run your race,\" he said. \"But I'm going to have a little fun\nwith you before you die. I'm going to use you as an object lesson.\nYou'll find it out in a little while.\"\n\n\"Go ahead, go ahead, Bram,\" Dodd grinned back at him. \"Just a few\nmillion years ago, and you were a speck of protoplasm--in that\npre-pleistocene age--swimming among the invertebrate crustaceans that\ncharacterized that epoch.\"\n\n\"Invertebrates and monotremes, Dodd,\" said Bram, almost wistfully. \"The\nmammals were already existent on the earth, as you know--\" Suddenly he\nbroke off, as he realized that Dodd was spoofing him. A yell of\nexecration broke from his lips. He uttered a high whistle, and instantly\nthe whiplike lashes of a hundred beetles whizzed through the darkness\nand remained poised over Dodd's head.\n\n\"Not even the marsupial lion, Bram,\" grinned Dodd, undismayed. \"Go\nahead, go ahead, but I'll not die with a lie upon my lips!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n_The Trail of Death_\n\n\"There's sure some sort of hoodoo on these Antarctic expeditions,\nWilson,\" said the city editor of _The Daily Record_ to the star rewrite\nman. He glanced through the hastily typed report that had come through\non the wireless set erected on the thirty-sixth story of the Record\nBuilding. \"Tommy Travers gone, eh? And James Dodd, too! There'll be woe\nand wailing along the Great White Way to-night when this news gets out.\nThey say that half the chorus girls in town considered themselves\nengaged to Tommy. Nice fellow, too! Always did like him!\"\n\n\"Queer, that curtain of fog that seems to lie on the actual site of the\nsouth pole,\" he continued, glancing over the report again. \"So Storm\nthinks that Tommy crashed in it, and that it's a million to one against\ntheir ever finding his remains. What's this about beetles? Shells of\nenormous prehistoric beetles found by Tommy and Dodd! That'll make good\ncopy, Wilson. Let's play that up. Hand it to Jones, and tell him to\nscare up a catching headline or two.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe beckoned to the boy who was hurrying toward his desk, a flimsy in his\nhand, glanced through it, and tossed it toward Wilson.\n\n\"What do they think this is, April Fool's Day?\" he asked. \"I'm surprised\nthat the International Press should fall for such stuff as that!\"\n\n\"Why, to-morrow is the first of April!\" exclaimed Wilson, tossing back\nthe cable dispatch with a contemptuous laugh.\n\n\"Well, it won't do the I. P. much good to play those tricks on their\nsubscribers,\" said the city editor testily. \"I'm surprised, to say the\nleast. I guess their Adelaide correspondent has gone off his head or\nsomething. Using poor Travers's name, too! Of course that fellow didn't\nknow he was dead, but still....\"\n\nThat was how _The Daily Record_ missed being the first to give out\ncertain information that was to stagger the world. The dispatch, which\nhad evidently outrun an earlier one, was as follows:\n\n    ADELAIDE, South Australia, March 31.--Further telegraphic\n    communications arriving almost continuously from Settler's\n    Station, signed by Thomas Travers, member of Travers Antarctic\n    Expedition, who claims to have penetrated earth's interior at\n    south pole and to have come out near Victoria Desert. Travers\n    states that swarm of prehistoric beetles, estimated at two\n    trillion, and as large as men, with shells impenetrable by rifle\n    bullets, now besieging Settler's Station, where he and Dodd and\n    Haidia, woman of subterranean race whom they brought away, are\n    shut up in telegraph office. Bram, former member of Greystoke\n    Expedition, said to be in charge of swarm, with intention of\n    obliterating human race. Every living thing at Settler's Station\n    destroyed, and swarm moving south.\n\nIt was a small-town paper a hundred miles from New York that took a\nchance on publishing this report from the International Press, in spite\nof frantic efforts on the parts of the head office to recall it after it\nhad been transmitted. This paper published the account as an April\nFool's Day joke, though later it took to itself the credit for having\nbelieved it. But by the time April Fool's Day dawned all the world knew\nthat the account was, if anything, an under-estimate of the fearful\nthings that were happening \"down under.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was known now that the swarm of monsters had originated in the Great\nVictoria Desert, one of the worst stretches of desolation in the world,\nsituated in the south-east corner of Western Australia. Their numbers\nwere incalculable. Wimbush, the aviator, who was attempting to cross the\ncontinent from east to west, reported afterward that he had flown for\nfour days, skirting the edge of the swarm, and that the whole of that\ntime they were moving in the same direction, a thick cloud that left a\ntrail of dense darkness on earth beneath them, like the path of an\neclipse. Wimbush escaped them only because he had a ceiling of twenty\nthousand feet, to which apparently the beetles could not soar.\n\nAnd this swarm was only about one-fourth of the whole number of the\nmonsters. This was the swarm that was moving westward, and subsequently\ntotally destroyed all living things in Kalgoorlie, Coolgardie, Perth,\nand all the coastal cities of Western Australia.\n\nShips were found drifting in the Indian Ocean, totally destitute of\ncrews and passengers; not even their skeletons were found, and it was\nestimated that the voracious monsters had carried them away bodily,\ndevoured them in the air, and dropped the remains into the water.\n\nAll the world knows now how the sea elephant herd on Kerguelen Island\nwas totally destroyed, and of the giant shells that were found lying\neverywhere on the deserted beaches, in positions that showed the\nmonsters had in the end devoured one another.\n\nMauritius was the most westerly point reached by a fraction of the\nswarm. A little over twenty thousand of the beetles reached that lovely\nisland, by count of the shells afterward, and all the world knows now of\nthe desperate and successful fight that the inhabitants waged against\nthem. Men and women, boys and girls, blacks and whites, finding that the\ndevils were invulnerable against rifle fire, sallied forth boldly with\nknives and choppers, and laid down a life for a life.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the second day after their appearance, the main swarm, a trillion and\na half strong, reached the line of the transcontinental railway, and\nmoved eastward into South Australia, traveling, it was estimated, at the\nrate of two hundred miles an hour. By the next morning they were in\nAdelaide, a city of nearly a quarter of a million people. By nightfall\nevery living thing in Adelaide and the suburbs had been eaten, except\nfor a few who succeeded in hiding in walled-up cellars, or in the\nsurrounding marshes.\n\nThat night the swarm was on the borders of New South Wales and Victoria,\nand moving in two divisions toward Melbourne and Sydney.\n\nThe northern half, it was quickly seen, was flying \"wild,\" with no\nparticular objective, moving in a solid cohort two hundred miles in\nlength, and devouring game, stock, and humans indiscriminately. It was\nthe southern division, numbering perhaps a trillion, that was under\ncommand of Bram, and aimed at destroying Melbourne as Adelaide had been\ndestroyed.\n\nBram, with his eight beetle steeds, was by this time known and execrated\nthroughout the world. He was pictured as Anti-Christ, and the fulfilment\nof the prophecies of the Rock of Revelations.\n\nAnd all this while--or, rather, until the telegraph wires were\ncut--broken, it was discovered later, by perching beetles--Thomas\nTravers was sending out messages from his post at Settler's Station.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSoon it was known that prodigious creatures were following in the wake\nof the devastating horde. Mantises, fifteen feet in height, winged\nthings like pterodactyls, longer than bombing airplanes, followed,\npreying on the stragglers. But the main bodies never halted, and the\ninroads that the destroyers made on their numbers were insignificant.\n\nBefore the swarm reached Adelaide the Commonwealth Government had taken\naction. Troops had been called out, and all the available airplanes in\nthe country had been ordered to assemble at Broken Hill, New South\nWales, a strategic point commanding the approaches to Sydney and\nMelbourne. Something like four hundred airplanes were assembled, with\nseveral batteries of anti-aircraft guns that had been used in the Great\nWar. Every amateur aviator in Australia was on the spot, with machines\nranging from tiny Moths to Handley-Pages--anything that could fly.\n\nNocturnal though the beetles had been, they no longer feared the light\nof the sun. In fact, it was ascertained later that they were blind. An\nopacity had formed over the crystalline lens of the eye. Blind, they\nwere no less formidable than with their sight. They existed only to\ndevour, and their numbers made them irresistible, no matter which way\nthey turned.\n\nAs soon as the vanguard of the dark cloud was sighted from Broken Hill,\nthe airplanes went aloft. Four hundred planes, each armed with machine\nguns, dashed into the serried hosts, drumming out volleys of lead. In a\nlong line, extending nearly to the limits of the beetle formation, thus\ngiving each aviator all the room he needed, the planes gave battle.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe first terror that fell upon the airmen was the discovery that, even\nat close range, the machine gun bullets failed to penetrate the shells.\nThe force of the impact whirled the beetles around, drove them together\nin bunches, sent them groping with weaving tentacles through the\nair--but that was all. On the main body of the invaders no impression\nwas made whatever.\n\nThe second terror was the realization that the swarm, driven down here\nand there from an altitude of several hundred feet, merely resumed their\nprogress on the ground, in a succession of gigantic leaps. Within a few\nminutes, instead of presenting an inflexible barrier, the line of\nairplanes was badly broken, each plane surrounded by swarms of the\nmonsters.\n\nThen Bram was seen. And that was the third terror, the sight of the\nfamous beetle steeds, four pairs abreast, with Bram reclining like a\nRoman emperor upon the surface of the shells. It is true, Bram had no\ninclination to risk his own life in battle. At the first sight of the\naviators he dodged into the thick of the swarm, where no bullet could\nreach him. Bram managed to transmit an order, and the beetles drew\ntogether.\n\nSome thought afterward that it was by thought transference he effected\nthis maneuver, for instantly the beetles, which had hitherto flown in\nloose order, became a solid wall, a thousand feet in height, closing in\non the planes. The propellers struck them and snapped short, and as the\nplanes went weaving down, the hideous monsters leaped into the cockpits\nand began their abominable meal.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNot a single plane came back. Planes and skeletons, and here and there a\nshell of a dead beetle, itself completely devoured, were all that was\nfound afterward.\n\nThe gunners stayed at their posts till the last moment, firing round\nafter round of shell and shrapnel, with insignificant results. Their\nskeletons were found not twenty paces from their guns--where the\nGunners' Monument now stands.\n\nHalf an hour after the flight had first been sighted the news was being\nradioed to Sydney, Melbourne, and all other Australian cities, advising\ninstant flight to sea as the only chance of safety. That radio message\nwas cut short--and men listened and shuddered. After that came the\ncrowding aboard all craft in the harbors, the tragedies of the _Eustis_,\nthe _All Australia_, the _Sepphoris_, sunk at their moorings. The\ninnumerable sea tragedies. The horde of fugitives that landed in New\nZealand. The reign of terror when the mob got out of hand, the burning\nof Melbourne, the sack of Sydney.\n\nAnd south and eastward, like a resistless flood, the beetle swarm came\npouring. Well had Bram boasted that he would make the earth a desert!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA hundred miles of poisoned carcasses of sheep, extended outside\nSydney's suburbs, gave the first promise of success. Long mounds of\nbeetle shells testified to the results; moreover, the beetles that fed\non the carcasses of their fellows, were in turn poisoned and died. But\nthis was only a drop in the bucket. What counted was that the swift\nadvance was slowing down. As if exhausted by their efforts, or else\nsatiated with food, the beetles were doing what the soldiers did.\n\nThey were digging in!\n\nTwenty-four miles from Sydney, eighteen outside Melbourne, the advance\nwas stayed.\n\nVolunteers who went out from those cities reported that the beetles\nseemed to be resting in long trenches that they had excavated, so that\nonly their shells appeared above ground. Trees were covered with\nclinging beetles, every wall, every house was invisible beneath the\nbeetle armor.\n\nAustralia had a respite. Perhaps only for a night or day, but still\ntime to draw breath, time to consider, time for the shiploads of\nfugitives to get farther from the continent that had become a shambles.\n\nAnd then the cry went up, not only from Australia, but from all the\nworld, \"Get Travers!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n_At Bay_\n\nBram put his fingers to his mouth and whistled, a shrill whistle, yet\naudible to Dodd, Tommy, and Haidia. Instantly three pairs of beetles\nappeared out of the throng. Their tentacles went out, and the two men\nand the girl found themselves hoisted separately upon the backs of the\npairs. Next moment they were flying side by side, high in the air above\nthe surrounding swarm.\n\nThey could see one another, but it was impossible for them to make their\nvoices heard above the rasping of the beetles' legs. Hours went by,\nwhile the moon crossed the sky and dipped toward the horizon. Tommy knew\nthat the moon would set about the hour of dawn. And the stars were\nalready beginning to pale when he saw a line of telegraph poles, then\ntwo lines of shining metals, then a small settlement of stone and brick\nhouses.\n\nTommy was not familiar with the geography of Australia, but he knew this\nmust be the transcontinental line.\n\nWhirling onward, the cloud of beetles suddenly swooped downward. For a\nmoment Tommy could see the frightened occupants of the settlement\ncrowding into the single street, then he shuddered with sick horror as\nhe saw them obliterated by the swarm.\n\nThere was no struggle, no attempt at flight or resistance. One moment\nthose forty-odd men were there--the next minute they existed no longer.\nThere was nothing but a swarm of beetles, walking about like men with\nshells upon their backs.\n\nAnd now Tommy saw evidences of Bram's devilish control of the swarm.\nFor out of the cloud dropped what seemed to be a phalanx of beetle\nguards, the military police of beetledom, and, lashing fiercely with\ntheir tentacles, they drove back all the swarm that sought to join their\ncompanions in their ghoulish feast. There was just so much food and no\nmore; the rest must seek theirs further.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut even beetles, it may be presumed, are not entirely under discipline\nat all times. The pair of beetles that bore Tommy, suddenly swooped\napart, ten or a dozen feet from the ground, and dashed into the thick of\nthe struggling, frenzied mass, flinging their rider to earth.\n\nTommy struck the soft sand, sat up, half dazed, saw his shell lying a\nfew feet away from him, and retrieved it just as a couple of the\nmonsters came swooping down at him.\n\nHe looked about him. Not far away stood Dodd and Haidia, with their\nshells on their backs. They recognized Tommy and ran toward him.\n\nNot more than twenty yards away stood the railroad station, with several\ncrates of goods on the platform. Next to it was a substantial house of\nstone, with the front door open.\n\nTommy pointed to it, and Dodd understood and shouted something that was\nlost in the furious buzz of the beetles' wings as they devoured their\nprey. The three raced for the entrance, gained it unmolested, and closed\nthe door.\n\nThere was a key in the door, and it was light enough for them to see a\nchain, which Dodd pulled into position. There was only one story, and\nthere were three rooms, apparently, with the kitchen. Tommy rushed to\nthe kitchen door, locked it, too, and, with almost super-human efforts,\ndragged the large iron stove against it. He rushed to the window, but it\nwas a mere loophole, not large enough to admit a child. Nevertheless, he\nstood the heavy table on end so that it covered it. Then he ran back.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDodd had already barricaded the window of the larger room, which was a\nbed-sitting room, with a heavy wardrobe, and the wooden bedstead,\njamming the two pieces sidewise against the wall, so that they could not\nbe forced apart without being demolished. He was now busy in the smaller\nroom, which seemed to be the station-master's office, dragging an iron\nsafe across the floor. But the window was criss-crossed with iron bars,\nand it was evident that the safe, which was locked, contained at times\nconsiderable money, for the window could hardly have been forced save by\na charge of nitro-glycerine or dynamite. However, it was against the\ndoor that Dodd placed the safe, and he stood back, panting.\n\n\"Good,\" said Haidia. \"That will hold them.\"\n\nThe two men looked at her doubtfully. Did Haidia know what she was\ntalking about?\n\nThe sun had risen. A long shaft shot into the room. Outside the beetles\nwere still buzzing as they turned over the vestiges of their prey. There\nwere as yet no signs of attack. Suddenly Tommy grasped Dodd's arm.\n\n\"Look!\" he shouted, pointing to a corner which had been in gloom a\nmoment before.\n\nThere was a table there, and on it a telegraphic instrument. Telegraphy\nhad been one of Tommy's hobbies in boyhood. In a moment he was busy at\nthe table.\n\nDot-dash-dot-dash! Then suddenly outside a furious hum, and the impact\nof beetle bodies against the front door.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTommy got up, grinning. That was the first, interrupted message from\nTommy that was received.\n\nThrough the barred window the three could see the furious efforts of the\nbeetles to force an entrance. But the very tensile strength of the\nbeetle-shells, which rendered them impervious to bullets, required a\nlaminate construction which rendered them powerless against brick or\nstone.\n\nDesperately the swarm dashed itself against the walls, until the ground\noutside was piled high with stunned beetles. Not the faintest impression\nwas made on the defenses.\n\n\"Watch them, Jim,\" said Tom. \"I'll go see if the rear's secure.\"\n\nThat thought of his seemed to have been anticipated by the beetles, for\nas Tommy reached the kitchen the swarm came dashing against door and\nwindow, always recoiling. Tommy came back, grinning all over his face.\n\n\"You were right, Haidia,\" he said. \"We've held them all right, and the\ntables are turned on Bram. Also I got a message through, I think,\" he\nadded to Dodd.\n\nDash--dot--dash--dot from the instrument. Tommy ran to the table again.\nDash--dot went back. For five minutes Tommy labored, while the beetles\nhammered now on one door, now on another, now on the windows. Then Tommy\ngot up.\n\n\"It was some station down the line,\" he said. \"I've told them, and\nthey're sending a man up here to replace the telegraphist, also a couple\nof cops. They think I'm crazy. I told them again. That's the best I\ncould do.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Dodd! Travers! For the last time--let's talk!\"\n\nThe cloud of beetles seemed to have thinned, for the sun was shining\ninto the room. Bram's voice was perfectly audible, though he himself was\ninvisible; probably he thought it likely that the defenders had obtained\nfirearms.\n\n\"Nothing to say to you, Bram,\" called Dodd. \"We've finished our\ndiscussion on the monotremes.\"\n\n\"I want you fellows to stand in with me,\" came Bram's plaintive tones.\n\"It's so lonesome all by one's self, Dodd.\"\n\n\"Ah, you're beginning to find that out, are you?\" Dodd could not resist\nanswering. \"You'll be lonelier yet before you're through.\"\n\n\"Dodd, I didn't bring that swarm up here. I swear it. I've been trying\nto control them from the beginning. I saw what was coming. I believe I\ncan avert this horror, drive them into the sea or something like that.\nDon't make me desperate, Dodd.\n\n\"And listen, old man. About those monotremes--sensible men don't quarrel\nover things like that. Why can't we agree to differ?\"\n\n\"Ah, now you're talking, Bram,\" Dodd answered. \"Only you're too late.\nAfter what's happened here to-day, we'll have no truck with you. That's\nfinal.\"\n\n\"Damn you,\" shrieked Bram. \"I'll batter down this house. I'll--\"\n\n\"You'll do nothing, Bram, because you can't,\" Dodd answered. \"Travers\nhas wired full information about your devil-horde, and likewise about\nyou, and all Australia will be prepared to give you a warm reception\nwhen you arrive.\"\n\n\"I tell you I'm invincible,\" Bram screamed. \"In three days Australia\nwill be a ruin, a depopulated desert. In a week, all southern Asia, in\nthree weeks Europe, in two months America.\"\n\n\"You've been taking too many of those pellets, Bram,\" Dodd answered.\n\"Stand back now! Stand back, wherever you are, or I'll open the door and\nthrow the slops over you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBram's screech rose high above the droning of the wings. In another\nmoment the interior of the room had grown as black as night. The rattle\nof the beetle shells against the four walls of the house was like the\nclattering of stage thunder.\n\nAll through the darkness Dodd could hear the unhurried clicking of the\nkey.\n\nAt last the rattling ceased. The sun shone in again. The ground all\naround the house was packed with fallen beetles, six feet high, a\nwrithing mass that creaked and clattered as it strove to disengage\nitself.\n\nBram's voice once more: \"I'm leaving a guard, Dodd. They'll get you if\nyou try to leave. But they won't eat you. I'm going to have you three\nsliced into little pieces, the Thousand Deaths of the Chinese. The\nbeetles will eat the parts that are sliced away--and you'll live to\nwatch them. I'll be back with a stick or two of dynamite to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but listen, Bram,\" Dodd sang out. \"Listen, you old marsupial\ntiger. When those pipe dreams clear away, I'm going to build a gallows\nof beetle-shells reaching to the moon, to hang you on!\"\n\nBram's screech of madness died away. The strident rasping of the\nbeetles' legs began again. For hours the three heard it; it was not\nuntil nightfall that it died away.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBram had made good his threat, for all around the house, extending as\nfar as they could see, was the host of beetle-guards. To venture out,\neven with their shells about them, was clearly a hazardous undertaking.\nThere was neither food nor water in the place.\n\n\"We'll just have to hold out,\" said Dodd, breaking one of the long\nperiods of silence.\n\nTommy did not answer; he did not hear him, for he was busy at the key.\nSuddenly he leaped to his feet.\n\n\"God, Jimmy,\" he cried, \"that devil's making good his threat! The\nswarm's in South Australia, destroying every living thing, wiping out\nwhole towns and villages! And they--they believe me now!\"\n\nHe sank into a chair. For the first time the strain of the awful past\nseemed to grip him. Haidia came to his side.\n\n\"The beetles are finish,\" she said in her soft voice.\n\n\"How d'you know, Haidia?\" demanded Dodd.\n\n\"The beetles are finish,\" Haidia repeated quietly, and that was all that\nDodd could get out of her. But again the key began to click, and Tommy\nstaggered to the table. Dot--dash--dash--dot. Presently he looked up\nonce more.\n\n\"The swarm's halfway to Adelaide,\" he said. \"They want to know if I can\nhelp them. Help them!\" He burst into hysterical laughter.\n\nToward evening he came back after an hour at the key. \"Line must be\nbroken,\" he said. \"I'm getting nothing.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the moonlight they could see the huge compound eyes of the beetle\nguards glittering like enormous diamonds outside. They had not been\nconscious of thirst during the day, but now, with the coming of the cool\nnight their desire for water became paramount.\n\n\"Tommy, there must be water in the station,\" said Dodd. \"I'm going to\nget a pitcher from the kitchen and risk it, Tommy. Take care of Haidia\nif--\" he added.\n\nBut Haidia laid her hand upon his arm. \"Do not go, Jimmydodd,\" she said.\n\"We can be thirsty to-night, and to-morrow the beetles will be finish.\"\n\n\"How d'you know?\" asked Dodd again. But now he realized that Haidia had\nnever learned the significance of an interrogation. She only repeated\nher statement, and again the two men had to remain content.\n\nThe long night passed. Outside the many facets of the beetle eyes.\nInside the two men, desperate with anxiety, not for themselves, but for\nthe fate of the world, snatching a few moments' sleep from time to time,\nthen looking up to see those glaring eyes from the silent watchers.\n\nThen dawn came stealing over the desert, and the two shook themselves\nfree from sleep. And now the eyes were gone.\n\nBut there was immense activity among the beetles. They were scurrying to\nand fro, and, as they watched, Dodd and Tommy began to see some\nsignificance in their movements.\n\n\"Why, they're digging trenches!\" Tommy shouted. \"That's horrible, Jimmy!\nAre they intending to conduct sapping operations against us like\nengineers, or what?\"\n\nDodd did not reply, and Tommy hardly expected any answer. As the two\nmen, now joined by Haidia, watched, they saw that the beetles were\nactually digging themselves into the sand.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWithin the space of an hour, by the time the first shafts of sunlight\nbegan to stream into the room, there was to be seen only the massive,\nrounded shells of the monsters as they squatted in the sand.\n\n\"Now you may fetch water,\" said Haidia, smiling at her lover. \"No, you\ndo not need the shells,\" she added. \"The beetles are finish. It is as\nthe wise men of my people told me.\"\n\nWondering, hesitating, Tommy and Dodd unlocked the front door. They\nstood upon the threshold ready to bolt back again. But there was no\nstirring among the beetle hosts.\n\nGrowing bolder, they advanced a few steps; then, shamed by Haidia's\ncourage, they followed her, still cautiously to the station.\n\nDodd shouted as he saw a water-tank, and a receptacle above it with a\nwater-cock. They let Haidia drink, then followed suit, and for a few\nmoments, as they appeased their thirst, the beetles were forgotten.\n\nThen they turned back. There had been no movement in that line of shells\nthat glinted in the morning sunlight.\n\n\"Come, I shall show you,\" said Haidia confidently, advancing toward the\ntrench.\n\nDodd would have stopped her, but the girl moved forward quickly, eluded\nhim with a graceful, mirthful gesture, and stooped down over the trench.\n\nShe rose up, raising in her arms an empty beetle-shell!\n\nDodd, who had reached the trench before Tommy, turned round and yelled\nto him excitedly. Tommy ran forward--and then he understood.\n\nThe shells were empty. The swarm, whose life cycle Bram had admitted he\ndid not understand, had just moulted!\n\nIt had moulted because the bodies, gorged with food, had grown too large\nfor the shells. In time, if left alone, the monsters would grow larger\nshells, become invincible again. But just now they were defenseless as\nnew-born babes--and knew it.\n\nDeep underneath the empty shells they had burrowed into the ground.\nEverywhere at the bottom of the deep trenches were the naked, bestial\ncreatures, waving helpless tentacles and squirming over one another as\nthey strove to find shelter and security.\n\nA sudden madness came over Tommy and Dodd. \"Dynamite--there must be\ndynamite!\" Dodd shouted, as he ran back to the station.\n\n\"Something better than dynamite,\" shouted Tommy, holding up one of a\nscore of drums of petrol!\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n_The World Set Free_\n\nThey waited two days at Settler's Station. To push along the line into\nthe desert would have been useless, and both men were convinced that an\nairplane would arrive for them. But it was not until the second\nafternoon that the aviator arrived, half-dead with thirst and fatigue,\nand almost incoherent.\n\nHis was the last plane on the Australian continent. He brought the news\nof the destruction of Adelaide, and of the siege of Melbourne and\nSydney, as he termed it. He told Dodd and Tommy that the two cities had\nbeen surrounded with trenches and barbed wire. Machine guns and\nartillery were bombarding the trenches in which the beetles had taken\nshelter.\n\n\"Has any one been out on reconnaissance?\" asked Tommy.\n\nNobody had been permitted to pass through the barbed wire, though there\nhad been volunteers. It meant certain death. But, unless the beetles\nwere sapping deep in the ground, what their purpose was, nobody knew.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTommy and Dodd led him to the piles of smoking, stinking d\u00e9bris and told\nhim.\n\nThat was where the aviator fainted from sheer relief.\n\n\"The Commonwealth wants you to take supreme command against the\nbeetles,\" he told Tommy, when he had recovered. \"I'm to bring you back.\nNot that they expect me back. But--God, what a piece of news! Forgive my\nswearing--I used to be a parson. Still am, for the matter of that.\"\n\n\"How are you going to bring us three back in your plane?\" asked Tommy.\n\n\"I shall stay here with Jimmydodd,\" said Haidia suavely. \"There is not\nthe least danger any more. You must destroy the beetles before their\nshells have grown again, that's all.\"\n\n\"Used to be a parson, you say? Still are?\" shouted Dodd excitedly.\n\"Thank God! I mean, I'm glad to hear it. Come inside, and come quick. I\nwant you too, Tommy!\"\n\nThen Tommy understood. And it seemed as if Haidia understood, by some\ninstinct that belongs exclusively to women, for her cheeks were flushed\nas she turned and smiled into Dodd's eyes.\n\nTen minutes later Tommy hopped into the biplane, leaving the happy\nmarried couple at Settler's Station. His eyes grew misty as the plane\ntook the air, and he saw them waving to him from the ground. Dodd and\nHaidia and he had been through so many adventures, and had reached\nsafety. He must not fail.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe did not fail. He found himself at Sydney in command of thirty\nthousand men, all enthusiastic for the fight for the human race,\nsoldiers and volunteers ready to fight until they dropped. When the news\nof the situation was made public, an immense wave of hope ran through\nthe world.\n\nNational differences were forgotten, color and creed and race grew more\ntolerant of one another. A new day had dawned--the day of humanity's\ntrue liberation.\n\nTommy's first act was to call out the fire companies and have the\nbeetles' trenches saturated with petrol from the fire hoses. Then\nincendiary bullets, shot from guns from a safe distance, quickly\nconverted them into blazing infernos.\n\nBut even so only a tithe of the beetle army had been destroyed. Two\nhundred planes had already been rushed from New Zealand, and their\naviators went up and scoured the country far and wide. Everywhere they\nfound trenches, and, where the soil was stony, millions of the beetles\nclustered helplessly beneath great mounds of discarded shells.\n\nAn army of black trackers had been brought in planes from all parts of\nthe country, and they searched out the beetle masses everywhere along\nthe course that the invaders had taken. Then incendiary bombs were\ndropped from above.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDay after day the beetle massacre went on. By the end of a week the\nsurvivors of the invasion began to take heart again. It was certain that\nthe greater portion of the horde had been destroyed.\n\nThere was only one thing lacking. No trace of Bram had been seen since\nhis appearance at the head of his beetle army in front of Broken Hill.\nAnd louder and more insistent grew the world clamor that he should be\nfound, and put to death in some way more horrible than any yet devised.\n\nThe ingenuity of a million minds worked upon this problem. Newspapers\nall over the world offered prizes for the most suitable form of death.\nIngenious Oriental tortures were rediscovered.\n\nThe only thing lacking was Bram.\n\nA spy craze ran through Australia. Five hundred Brams were found, and\nall of them were in imminent danger of death before they were able to\nprove an alias.\n\nAnd, oddly enough, it was Tommy and Dodd who found Bram. For Dodd had\nbeen brought back east, together with his bride, and given an important\ncommand in the Army of Extermination.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDodd had joined Tommy not far from Broken Hill, where a swarm of a\nhundred thousand beetles had been found in a little known valley. The\nmonsters had begun to grow new shells, and the news had excited a fresh\nwave of apprehension. The airplanes had concentrated for an attack upon\nthem, and Tommy and Dodd were riding together, Tommy at the controls,\nand Dodd observing.\n\nDodd called through the tube to Tommy, and indicated a mass that was\nmoving through the scrub--some fifty thousand beetles, executing short\nhops and evidently regaining some vitality. Tommy nodded.\n\nHe signalled, and the fleet of planes circled around and began to drop\ntheir incendiary bombs. Within a few minutes the beetles were ringed\nwith a wall of fire. Presently the whole terrain was a blazing furnace.\n\nHours later, when the fires had died away, Tommy and Dodd went down to\nlook at the destruction that had been wrought. The scene was horrible.\nGreat masses of charred flesh and shell were piled up everywhere.\n\n\"I guess that's been a pretty thorough job,\" said Tommy. \"Let's get\nback, Jim.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" cried Dodd, pointing. Then, \"My God, Tommy, it's one of\nour men!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a man, but it was not one of their men, that creeping, maimed,\nhalf-cinder and half-human thing that was trying to crawl into the\nhollow of a rock. It was Bram, and recognition was mutual.\n\nBram dropping, moaning; he was only the shell of a man, and it was\nincredible how he had managed to survive that ordeal of fire. The\nremainder of his life, which only his indomitable will had held in that\nshattered body, was evidently a matter of minutes, but he looked up at\nDodd and laughed.\n\n\"So--you're--here, damn you!\" he snarled. \"And--you think--you've won.\nI've--another card--another invasion of the world--beside which this is\nchild's play. It's an invasion--\"\n\nBram was going, but he pulled himself together with a supreme effort.\n\n\"Invasion by--new species of--monotremes,\" he croaked. \"Deep\ndown in--earth. Was saving to--prove you the liar you are.\nMonotremes--egg-laying platypus big as an elephant--existent long\nbefore pleistocene epoch--make you recant, you lying fool!\"\n\nBram died, an outburst of bitter laughter on his lips. Dodd stood silent\nfor a while; then reverently he removed his hat.\n\n\"He was a madman and a devil, but he had the potentialities of a god,\nTommy,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n  SUCH WELL-KNOW WRITERS AS\n\n  Murray Leinster, Ray Cummings, Victor Rousseau, R.

What was the connection between this\n    catastrophe and the weird strains of the Mad Musician's violin?\n\n[Illustration: _In an inner room they found a diabolical machine._]\n\n\nTo the accompaniment of a crashing roar, not unlike rumbling thunder,\nthe proud Colossus Building, which a few minutes before had reared its\nsixty stories of artistic architecture towards the blue dome of the sky,\ncrashed in a rugged, dusty heap of stone, brick, cement and mortar. The\nsteel framework, like the skeleton of some prehistoric monster, still\nreared to dizzy heights but in a bent and twisted shape of grotesque\noutline.\n\nNo one knew how many lives were snuffed out in the avalanche.\n\nAs the collapse occurred in the early dawn it was not believed the\ndeath list would be large. It was admitted, however, that autos, cabs\nand surface cars may have been caught under the falling rock. One train\nwas known to have been wrecked in the subway due to a cave-in from the\nsurface under the ragged mountain of debris.\n\nThe litter fairly filled a part of Times Square, the most congested\ncross-roads on God's footstool. Straggling brick and rock had rolled\nacross the street to the west and had crashed into windows and doors of\ninnocent small tradesmen's shops.\n\nA few minutes after the crash a mad crowd of people had piled from\nsubway exits as far away as Penn Station and Columbus Circle and from\ncross streets. These milled about, gesticulating and shouting\nhysterically. All neighboring police stations were hard put to handle\nthe growing mob.\n\nHundreds of dead and maimed were being carried to the surface from the\nwrecked train in the subway. Trucks and cabs joined the ambulance crews\nin the work of transporting these to morgues and hospitals. As the\nmorning grew older and the news of the disaster spread, more milling\nthousands tried to crowd into the square. Many were craning necks\nhopelessly on the outskirts of the throng, blocks away, trying vainly to\nget a view of what lay beyond.\n\nThe fire department and finally several companies of militia joined the\npolice in handling the crowd. Newsies, never asleep, yowled their\n\"Wuxtras\" and made much small money.\n\nThe newspapers devoted solid pages in attempting to describe what had\nhappened. Nervously, efficient reporters had written and written, using\nall their best adjectives and inventing new ones in attempts to picture\nthe crash and the hysterics which followed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen the excitement was at its height a middle-aged man, bleeding at the\nhead, clothes torn and dusty, staggered into the West 47th street\npolice station. He found a lone sergeant at the desk.\n\nThe police sergeant jumped to his feet as the bedraggled man entered and\nstumbled to a bench.\n\n\"I'm Pat Brennan, street floor watchman of the Colossus,\" he said. \"I\nran for it. I got caught in the edge of the wreck and a brick clipped\nme. I musta been out for some time. When I came around I looked back\njust once at the wreck and then I beat it over here. Phone my boss.\"\n\n\"I'll let you phone your boss,\" said the sergeant, \"but first tell me\njust what happened.\"\n\n\"Earthquake, I guess. I saw the floor heaving in waves. Glass was\ncrashing and falling into the street. All windows in the arcade buckled,\neither in or out. I ran into the street and looked up. God, what a\nsight! The building from sidewalk to towers was rocking and waving and\ntwisting and buckling and I saw it was bound to crumple, so I lit out\nand ran. I heard a roar like all Hell broke loose and then something\nnicked me and my light went out.\"\n\n\"How many got caught in the building?\"\n\n\"Nobody got out but me, I guess. There weren't many tenants. The\nbuilding is all rented, but not everybody had moved in yet and those as\nhad didn't spend their nights there. There was a watchman for every five\nstories. An engineer and his crew. Three elevator operators had come in.\nThere was no names of tenants in or out on my book after 4 A.M. The\ncrash musta come about 6. That's all.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThroughout the country the news of the crash was received with great\ninterest and wonderment, but in one small circle it caused absolute\nconsternation. That was in the offices of the Muller Construction\nCompany, the builders of the Colossus. Jason V. Linane, chief engineer\nof the company, was in conference with its president, James J. Muller.\n\nMuller sat with his head in his hands, and his face wore an expression\nof a man in absolute anguish. Linane was pacing the floor, a wild\nexpression in his eyes, and at times he muttered and mumbled under his\nbreath.\n\nIn the other offices the entire force from manager to office boys was\nhushed and awed, for they had seen the expressions on the faces of the\nheads of the concern when they stalked into the inner office that\nmorning.\n\nMuller finally looked up, rather hopelessly, at Linane.\n\n\"Unless we can prove that the crash was due to some circumstance over\nwhich we had no control, we are ruined,\" he said, and there actually\nwere tears in his eyes.\n\n\"No doubt about that,\" agreed Linane, \"but I can swear that the Colossus\nwent up according to specifications and that every ounce and splinter of\nmaterial was of the best. The workmanship was faultless. We have built\nscores of the biggest blocks in the world and of them all this Colossus\nwas the most perfect. I had prided myself on it. Muller, it was\nperfection. I simply cannot account for it. I cannot. It should have\nstood up for thousands of years. The foundation was solid rock. It\npositively was not an earthquake. No other building in the section was\neven jarred. No other earthquake was ever localized to one half block of\nthe earth's crust, and we can positively eliminate an earthquake or an\nexplosion as the possible cause. I am sure we are not to blame, but we\nwill have to find the exact cause.\"\n\n\"If there was some flaw?\" questioned Muller, although he knew the\nanswer.\n\n\"If there was some flaw, then we're sunk. The newspapers are already\nclamoring for probes, of us, of the building, of the owners and\neverybody and everything. We have got to have something damned plausible\nwhen we go to bat on this proposition or every dollar we have in the\nworld will have to be paid out.\"\n\n\"That is not all,\" said Muller: \"not only will we be penniless, but we\nmay have to go to jail and we will never be able to show our faces in\nreputable business circles again. Who was the last to go over that\nbuilding?\"\n\n\"I sent Teddy Jenks. He is a cub and is swell headed and too big for his\npants, but I would bank my life on his judgment. He has the judgment of\na much older man and I would also bank my life and reputation on his\nengineering skill and knowledge. He pronounced the building positively\nO.K.--100 per cent.\"\n\n\"Where is Jenks?\"\n\n\"He will be here as soon as his car can drive down from Tarrytown. He\nshould be here now.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs they talked Jenks, the youngest member of the engineering force,\nentered. He entered like a whirlwind. He threw his hat on the floor and\ndrew out a drawer of a cabinet. He pulled out the plans for the\nColossus, big blue prints, some of them yards in extent, and threw them\non the floor. Then he dropped to his knees and began poring over them.\n\n\"This is a hell of a time for you to begin getting around,\" exploded\nMuller. \"What were you doing, cabareting all night?\"\n\n\"It sure is terrible--awful,\" said Jenks, half to himself.\n\n\"Answer me,\" thundered Muller.\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said Jenks, looking up. He saw the look of anguish on his\nboss's face and forgot his own excitement in sympathy. He jumped to his\nfeet, placed his arm about the shoulders of the older man and led him to\na chair. Linane only scowled at the young man.\n\n\"I was delayed because I stopped by to see the wreck. My God, Mr.\nMuller, it is awful.\" Jenks drew his hand across his eye as if to erase\nthe scene of the wrecked building. Then patting the older man\naffectionately on the back he said:\n\n\"Buck up. I'm on the job, as usual. I'll find out about it. It could not\nhave been our fault. Why man, that building was as strong as Gibraltar\nitself!\"\n\n\"You were the last to inspect it,\" accused Muller, with a break in his\nvoice.\n\n\"Nobody knows that better than I, and I can swear by all that's square\nand honest that it was no fault of the material or the construction. It\nmust have been--\"\n\n\"Must have been what?\"\n\n\"I'll be damned if I know.\"\n\n\"That's like him,\" said Linane, who, while really kindly intentioned,\nhad always rather enjoyed prodding the young engineer.\n\n\"Like me, like the devil,\" shouted Jenks, glaring at Linane. \"I suppose\nyou know all about it, you're so blamed wise.\"\n\n\"No, I don't know,\" admitted Linane. \"But I do know that you don't like\nme to tell you anything. Nevertheless, I am going to tell you that you\nhad better get busy and find out what caused it, or--\"\n\n\"That's just what I'm doing,\" said Jenks, and he dived for his plans on\nthe floor.\n\nNewspaper reporters, many of them, were fighting outside to get in.\nMuller looked at Linane when a stenographer had announced the reporters\nfor the tenth time.\n\n\"We had better let them in,\" he said, \"it looks bad to crawl for cover.\"\n\n\"What are you going to tell them?\" asked Linane.\n\n\"God only knows,\" said Muller.\n\n\"Let me handle them,\" said Jenks, looking up confidently.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe newspapermen had rushed the office. They came in like a wild wave.\nQuestions flew like feathers at a cock-fight.\n\nMuller held up his hand and there was something in his grief-stricken\neyes that held the gentlemen of the press in silence. They had time to\nlook around. They saw the handsome, dark-haired, brown-eyed Jenks poring\nover the plans. Dust from the carpet smudged his knees, and he had\nrubbed some of it over a sweating forehead, but he still looked the\npicture of self-confident efficiency.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Muller slowly, \"I can answer all your questions at\nonce. Our firm is one of the oldest and staunchest in the trade. Our\nbuildings stand as monuments to our integrity--\"\n\n\"All but one,\" said a young Irishman.\n\n\"You are right. All but one,\" confessed Muller. \"But that one, believe\nme, has been visited by an act of God. Some form of earthquake or some\nunlooked for, uncontrolled, almost unbelievable catastrophe has\nhappened. The Muller company stands back of its work to its last dollar.\nGentlemen, you know as much as we do. Mr. Jenks there, whose reputation\nas an engineer is quite sturdy, I assure you, was the last to inspect\nthe building. He passed upon it when it was finished. He is at your\nservice.\"\n\nJenks arose, brushed some dust from his knees.\n\n\"You look like you'd been praying,\" bandied the Irishman.\n\n\"Maybe I have. Now let me talk. Don't broadside me with questions. I\nknow what you want to know. Let me talk.\"\n\nThe newspapermen were silent.\n\n\"There has been talk of probing this disaster, naturally,\" began Jenks.\n\"You all know, gentlemen, that we will aid any inquiry to our utmost.\nYou want to know what we have to say about it--who is responsible. In a\nreasonable time I will have a statement to make that will be startling\nin the extreme. I am not sure of my ground now.\"\n\n\"How about the ground under the Colossus?\" said the Irishman.\n\n\"Don't let's kid each other,\" pleaded Jenks. \"Look at Mr. Muller: it is\nas if he had lost his whole family. We are good people. I am doing all I\ncan. Mr. Linane, who had charge of the construction, is doing all he\ncan. We believe we are blameless. If it is proven otherwise we will\nacknowledge our fault, assume financial responsibility, and take our\nmedicine. Believe me, that building was perfection plus, like all our\nbuildings. That covers the entire situation.\"\n\nHundreds of questions were parried and answered by the three engineers,\nand the reporters left convinced that if the Muller Construction Company\nwas responsible, it was not through any fault of its own.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe fact that Jenks and Linane were not strong for each other, except to\nrecognize each other's ability as engineers, was due to an incident of\nthe past. This incident had caused a ripple of mirth in engineering\ncircles when it happened, and the laugh was on the older man, Linane.\n\nIt was when radio was new. Linane, a structural engineer, had paid\nlittle attention to radio. Jenks was the kind of an engineer who dabbled\nin all sciences. He knew his radio.\n\nWhen Jenks first came to work with a technical sheepskin and a few tons\nof brass, Linane accorded him only passing notice. Jenks craved the\nplaudits of the older man and his palship. Linane treated him as a son,\nbut did not warm to his social advances.\n\n\"I'm as good an engineer as he is,\" mused Jenks, \"and if he is going to\nhigh-hat me, I'll just put a swift one over on him and compel his\nnotice.\"\n\nThe next day Jenks approached Linane in conference and said:\n\n\"I've got a curious bet on, Mr. Linane. I am betting sound can travel a\nmile quicker than it travels a quarter of a mile.\"\n\n\"What?\" said Linane.\n\n\"I'm betting fifty that sound can travel a mile quicker than it can\ntravel a quarter of a mile.\"\n\n\"Oh no--it can't,\" insisted Linane.\n\n\"Oh yes--it can!\" decided Jenks.\n\n\"I'll take some of that fool money myself,\" said Linane.\n\n\"How much?\" asked Jenks.\n\n\"As much as you want.\"\n\n\"All right--five hundred dollars.\"\n\n\"How you going to prove your contention?\"\n\n\"By stop watches, and your men can hold the watches. We'll bet that a\npistol shot can be heard two miles away quicker than it can be heard a\nquarter of a mile away.\"\n\n\"Sound travels about a fifth of a mile a second. The rate varies\nslightly according to temperature,\" explained Linane. \"At the freezing\npoint the rate is 1,090 feet per second and increases a little over one\nfoot for every degree Fahrenheit.\"\n\n\"Hot or cold,\" breezed Jenks, \"I am betting you five hundred dollars\nthat sound can travel two miles quicker than a quarter-mile.\"\n\n\"You're on, you damned idiot!\" shouted the completely exasperated\nLinane.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJenks let Linane's friends hold the watches and his friend held the\nmoney. Jenks was to fire the shot.\n\nJenks fired the shot in front of a microphone on a football field. One\nof Linane's friends picked the sound up instantaneously on a three-tube\nradio set two miles away. The other watch holder was standing in the\nopen a quarter of a mile away and his watch showed a second and a\nfraction.\n\nAll hands agreed that Jenks had won the bet fairly. Linane never exactly\nliked Jenks after that.\n\nThen Jenks rather aggravated matters by a habit. Whenever Linane would\nmake a very positive statement Jenks would look owl-eyed and say: \"Mr.\nLinane, I'll have to sound you out about that.\" The heavy accent on the\nword \"sound\" nettled Linane somewhat.\n\nLinane never completely forgave Jenks for putting over this \"fast one.\"\nSocially they were always more or less at loggerheads, but neither let\nthis feeling interfere with their work. They worked together faithfully\nenough and each recognized the ability of the other.\n\nAnd so it was that Linane and Jenks, their heads together, worked all\nnight in an attempt to find some cause that would tie responsibility\nfor the disaster on mother nature.\n\nThey failed to find it and, sleepy-eyed, they were forced to admit\nfailure, so far.\n\nThe newspapers, to whom Muller had said that he would not shirk any\nresponsibility, began a hue and cry for the arrest of all parties in any\nway concerned with the direction of the building of the Colossus.\n\nWhen the death list from the crash and subway wreck reached 97, the\npress waxed nasty and demanded the arrest of Muller, Linane and Jenks in\nno uncertain tones.\n\nHalf dead from lack of sleep, the three men were taken by the police to\nthe district attorney's offices and, after a strenuous grilling, were\nformally placed under arrest on charges of criminal negligence. They put\nup a $50,000 bond in each case and were permitted to go and seek further\nto find the cause of what the newspapers now began calling the \"Colossal\nFailure.\"\n\nSeveral days were spent by Linane and Jenks in examining the wreckage\nwhich was being removed from Times Square, truckload after truckload, to\na point outside the city. Here it was again sorted and examined and\npiled for future disposal.\n\nSo far as could be found every brick, stone and ounce of material used\nin the building was perfect. Attorneys, however, assured Linane, Jenks\nand Muller that they would have to find the real cause of the disaster\nif they were to escape possible long prison sentences.\n\nNight after night Jenks courted sleep, but it would not come. He began\nto grow wan and haggard.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJenks took to walking the streets at night, mile after mile, thinking,\nalways thinking, and searching his mind for a solution of the mystery.\n\nIt was evening. He had walked past the scene of the Colossus crash\nseveral times. He found himself on a side street. He looked up and saw\nin electric lights:\n\n  TOWN HALL\n\n  _Munsterbergen, the Mad Musician_\n  Concert Here To-night.\n\nHe took five dollars from his pocket and bought a ticket. He entered\nwith the crowd and was ushered to a seat. He looked neither to the right\nor left. His eyes were sunken, his face lined with worry.\n\nSomething within Jenks caused him to turn slightly. He was curiously\naware of a beautiful girl who sat beside him. She had a mass of golden\nhair which seemed to defy control. It was wild, positively tempestuous.\nHer eyes were deep blue and her skin as white as fleecy clouds in\nspring. He was dimly conscious that those glorious eyes were troubled.\n\nShe glanced at him. She was aware that he was suffering. A great surge\nof sympathy welled in her heart. She could not explain the feeling.\n\nA great red plush curtain parted in the center and drew in graceful\nfolds to the edges of the proscenium. A small stage was revealed.\n\nA tousle-headed man with glaring, beady black eyes, dressed in black\nevening clothes stepped forward and bowed. Under his arm was a violin.\nHe brought the violin forward. His nose, like the beak of some great\nbird, bobbed up and down in acknowledgment of the plaudits which greeted\nhim. His long nervous fingers began to caress the instrument and his\nlips began to move.\n\nJenks was aware that he was saying something, but was not at all\ninterested. What he said was this:\n\n\"Maybe, yes, I couldn't talk so good English, but you could understood\nit, yes? Und now I tell you dot I never play the compositions of any\nman. I axtemporize exgloosively. I chust blay und blay, und maybe you\nshould listen, yes? If I bleeze you I am chust happy.\"\n\nJenks' attention was drawn to him. He noted his wild appearance.\n\n\"He sure looks mad enough,\" mused Jenks.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe violinist flipped the fiddle up under his chin. He drew the bow over\nthe strings and began a gentle melody that reminded one of rain drops\nfalling on calm waters.\n\nJenks forgot his troubles. He forgot everything. He slumped in his seat\nand his eyes closed. The rain continued falling from the strings of the\nviolin.\n\nSuddenly the melody changed to a glad little lilting measure, as sweet\nas love itself. The sun was coming out again and the birds began to\nsing. There was the trill of a canary with the sun on its cage. There\nwas the song of the thrush, the mocking-bird and the meadow lark. These\nblended finally into a melodious burst of chirping melody which seemed a\nchorus of the wild birds of the forest and glen. Then the lilting love\nmeasure again. It tore at the heart strings, and brought tears to one's\neyes.\n\nUnconsciously the girl next to Jenks leaned towards him. Involuntarily\nhe leaned to meet her. Their shoulders touched. The cloud of her golden\nhair came to rest against his dark locks. Their hands found each other\nwith gentle pressure. Both were lost to the world.\n\nAbruptly the music changed. There was a succession of broken treble\nnotes that sounded like the crackling of flames. Moans deep and\nmelancholy followed. These grew more strident and prolonged, giving\nplace to abject howls, suggesting the lamentations of the damned.\n\nThe hands of the boy and girl gripped tensely. They could not help\nshuddering.\n\nThe violin began to produce notes of a leering, jeering character,\ngrowing more horrible with each measure until they burst in a loud\nguffaw of maniacal laughter.\n\nThe whole performance was as if someone had taken a heaven and plunged\nit into a hell.\n\nThe musician bowed jerkily, and was gone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was no applause, only wild exclamations. Half the house was on its\nfeet. The other half sat as if glued to chairs.\n\nThe boy and the girl were standing, their hands still gripping tensely.\n\n\"Come, let's get out of here,\" said Jenks. The girl took her wrap and\nJenks helped her into it. Hand in hand they fled the place.\n\nIn the lobby their eyes met, and for the first time they realized they\nwere strangers. Yet deep in their hearts was a feeling that their fates\nhad been sealed.\n\n\"My goodness!\" burst from the girl.\n\n\"It can't be helped now,\" said Jenks decisively.\n\n\"What can't be helped?\" asked the girl, although she knew in her heart.\n\n\"Nothing can be helped,\" said Jenks. Then he added: \"We should know each\nother by this time. We have been holding hands for an hour.\"\n\nThe girl's eyes flared. \"You have no right to presume on that\nsituation,\" she said.\n\nJenks could have kicked himself. \"Forgive me,\" he said. \"It was only\nthat I just wanted so to know you. Won't you let me see you home?\"\n\n\"You may,\" said the girl simply, and she led the way to her own car.\n\nThey drove north.\n\nTheir bodies seemed like magnets. They were again shoulder to shoulder,\nholding hands.\n\n\"Will you tell me your name?\" pleaded Jenks.\n\n\"Surely,\" replied the girl. \"I am Elaine Linane.\"\n\n\"What?\" exploded Jenks. \"Why, I work with a Linane, an engineer with the\nMuller Construction Company.\"\n\n\"He is my father,\" she said.\n\n\"Why, we are great friends,\" said the boy. \"I am Jenks, his\nassistant--at least we work together.\"\n\n\"Yes, I have heard of you,\" said the girl. \"It is strange, the way we\nmet. My father admires your work, but I am afraid you are not great\nfriends.\" The girl had forgotten her troubles. She chuckled. She had\nheard the way Jenks had \"sounded\" her father out.\n\nJenks was speechless. The girl continued:\n\n\"I don't know whether to like you or to hate you. My father is an old\ndear. You were cruel to him.\"\n\nJenks was abject. \"I did not mean to be,\" he said. \"He rather belittled\nme without realizing it. I had to make my stand. The difference in our\nyears made him take me rather too lightly. I had to compel his notice,\nif I was to advance.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said the girl.\n\n\"I am sorry--so sorry.\"\n\n\"You might not have been altogether at fault,\" said the girl. \"Father\nforgets at times that I have grown up. I resent being treated like a\nchild, but he is the soul of goodness and fatherly care.\"\n\n\"I know that,\" said Jenks.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEvery engineer knows his mathematics. It was this fact, coupled with\nwhat the world calls a \"lucky break,\" that solved the Colossus mystery.\nNobody can get around the fact that two and two make four.\n\nJenks had happened on accomplishment to advance in the engineering\nprofession, and it was well for him that he had reached a crisis. He had\nnever believed in luck or in hunches, so it was good for him to be\nbrought face to face with the fact that sometimes the footsteps of man\nare guided. It made him begin to look into the engineering of the\nuniverse, to think more deeply, and to acknowledge a Higher Power.\n\nWith Linane he had butted into a stone wall. They were coming to know\nwhat real trouble meant. The fact that they were innocent did not make\nthe steel bars of a cage any more attractive. Their troubles began to\nwrap about them with the clammy intimacy of a shroud. Then came the\nlucky break.\n\nNext to his troubles, Jenks' favorite topic was the Mad Musician. He\ntried to learn all he could about this uncanny character at whose\nconcert he had met the girl of his life. He learned two facts that made\nhim perk up and think.\n\nOne was that the Mad Musician had had offices and a studio in the\nColossus and was one of the first to move in. The other was that the Mad\nMusician took great delight in shattering glassware with notes of or\nvibrations from a violin. Nearly everyone knows that a glass tumbler can\nbe shattered by the proper note sounded on a violin. The Mad Musician\ntook delight in this trick. Jenks courted his acquaintance, and saw him\nshatter a row of glasses of different sizes by sounding different notes\non his fiddle. The glasses crashed one after another like gelatine balls\nhit by the bullets of an expert rifleman.\n\nThen Jenks, the engineer who knew his mathematics, put two and two\ntogether. It made four, of course.\n\n\"Listen, Linane,\" he said to his co-worker: \"this fiddler is crazier\nthan a flock of cuckoos. If he can crack crockery with violin sound\nvibrations, is it not possible, by carrying the vibrations to a much\nhigher power, that he could crack a pile of stone, steel, brick and\ncement, like the Colossus?\"\n\n\"Possible, but hardly probable. Still,\" Linane mused, \"when you think\nabout it, and put two and two together.... Let's go after him and see\nwhat he is doing now.\"\n\nBoth jumped for their coats and hats. As they fared forth, Jenks cinched\nhis argument:\n\n\"If a madman takes delight in breaking glassware with a vibratory wave\nor vibration, how much more of a thrill would he get by crashing a\nmountain?\"\n\n\"Wild, but unanswerable,\" said Linane.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJenks had been calling on the Mad Musician at his country place. \"He had\na studio in the Colossus,\" he reminded Linane. \"He must have re-opened\nsomewhere else in town. I wonder where.\"\n\n\"Musicians are great union men,\" said Linane. \"Phone the union.\"\n\nTeddy Jenks did, but the union gave the last known town address as the\nColossus.\n\n\"He would remain in the same district around Times Square,\" reasoned\nJenks. \"Let's page out the big buildings and see if he is not preparing\nto crash another one.\"\n\n\"Fair enough,\" said Linane, who was too busy with the problem at hand to\nchoose his words.\n\nTogether the engineers started a canvass of the big buildings in the\ntheatrical district. After four or five had been searched without result\nthey entered the 30-story Acme Theater building.\n\nHere they learned that the Mad Musician had leased a four-room suite\njust a few days before. This suite was on the fifteenth floor, just half\nway up in the big structure.\n\nThey went to the manager of the building and frankly stated their\nsuspicions. \"We want to enter that suite when the tenant is not there,\"\nthey explained, \"and we want him forestalled from entering while we are\nexamining the premises.\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better notify the police?\" asked the building manager, who\nhad broken out in a sweat when he heard the dire disaster which might be\nin store for the stately Acme building.\n\n\"Not yet,\" said Linane. \"You see, we are not sure: we have just been\nputting two and two together.\"\n\n\"We'll get the building detective, anyway,\" insisted the manager.\n\n\"Let him come along, but do not let him know until we are sure. If we\nare right we will find a most unusual infernal machine,\" said Linane.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe three men entered the suite with a pass-key. The detective was left\noutside in the hall to halt anyone who might disturb the searchers. It\nwas as Jenks had thought. In an inner room they found a diabolical\nmachine--a single string stretched across two bridges, one of brass and\none of wood. A big horsehair bow attached to a shaft operated by a motor\nwas automatically sawing across the string. The note resulting was\nevidently higher than the range of the human ear, because no audible\nsound resulted. It was later estimated that the destructive note was\nseveral octaves higher than the highest note on a piano.\n\nThe entire machine was enclosed in a heavy wire-net cage, securely\nbolted to the floor. Neither the string or bow could be reached. It was\nevidently the Mad Musician's idea that the devilish contrivance should\nnot be reached by hands other than his own.\n\nHow long the infernal machine had been operating no one knew, but the\nvisitors were startled when the building suddenly began to sway\nperceptibly. Jenks jumped forward to stop the machine but could not find\na switch.\n\n\"See if the machine plugs in anywhere in a wall socket!\" he shouted to\nLinane, who promptly began examining the walls. Jenks shouted to the\nbuilding manager to phone the police to clear the streets around the big\nbuilding.\n\n\"Tell the police that the Acme Theater building may crash at any\nmoment,\" he instructed.\n\nThe engineers were perfectly cool in face of the great peril, but the\nbuilding manager lost his head completely and began to run around in\ncircles muttering: \"Oh, my God, save me!\" and other words of\nsupplication that blended into an incoherent babel.\n\nJenks rushed to the man, trying to still his wild hysteria.\n\nThe building continued to sway dangerously.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJenks looked from a window. An enormous crowd was collecting, watching\nthe big building swinging a foot out of plumb like a giant pendulum. The\ncrowd was growing. Should the building fall the loss of life would be\nappalling. It was mid-morning. The interior of the building teemed with\nthousands of workers, for all floors above the third were offices.\n\nTeddy Jenks turned suddenly. He heard the watchman in the hall scream in\nterror. Then he heard a body fall. He rushed to the door to see the Mad\nMusician standing over the prostrate form of the detective, a devilish\ngrin on his distorted countenance.\n\nThe madman turned, saw Jenks, and started to run. Jenks took after him.\nUp the staircase the madman rushed toward the roof. Teddy followed him\ntwo floors and then rushed out to take the elevators. The building in\nits mad swaying had made it impossible for the lifts to be operated.\nTeddy realized this with a distraught gulp in his throat. He returned to\nthe stairway and took up the pursuit of the madman.\n\nThe corridors were beginning to fill with screaming men and wailing\ngirls. It was a sight never to be forgotten.\n\nLaboriously Jenks climbed story after story without getting sight of the\nmadman. Finally he reached the roof. It was waving like swells on a lake\nbefore a breeze. He caught sight of the Mad Musician standing on the\nstreet wall, thirty stories from the street, a leer on his devilish\nvisage. He jumped for him.\n\nThe madman grasped him and lifted him up to the top of the wall as a cat\nmight have lifted a mouse. Both men were breathing heavily as a result\nof their 15-story climb.\n\nThe madman tried to throw Teddy Jenks to the street below. Teddy clung\nto him. The two battled desperately as the building swayed.\n\nThe dense crowd in the street had caught sight of the two men fighting\non the narrow coping, and the shout which rent the air reached the ears\nof Jenks.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe mind of the engineer was still working clearly, but a wild fear\ngripped his heart. His strength seemed to be leaving him. The madman\npushed him back, bending his spine with brute strength. Teddy was forced\nto the narrow ledge that had given the two men footing. The fingers of\nthe madman gripped his throat.\n\nHe was dimly conscious that the swaying of the building was slowing\ndown. His reason told him that Linane had found the wall socket and had\nstopped the sawing of the devil's bow on the engine of hell.\n\nHe saw the madman draw a big knife. With his last remaining strength he\nreached out and grasped the wrist above the hand which held the weapon.\nIn spite of all he could do he saw the madman inching the knife nearer\nand nearer his throat.\n\nGrim death was peering into the bulging eyes of Teddy Jenks, when his\nengineering knowledge came to his rescue. He remembered the top stories\nof the Acme building were constructed with a step of ten feet in from\nthe street line, for every story of construction above the 24th floor.\n\n\"If we fall,\" he reasoned, \"we can only fall one story.\" Then he\ndeliberately rolled his own body and the weight of the madman, who held\nhim, over the edge of the coping. At the same time he twisted the\nmadman's wrist so the point of the knife pointed to the madman's body.\n\nThere was a dim consciousness of a painful impact. Teddy had fallen\nunderneath, but the force of the two bodies coming together had thrust\nthe knife deep into the entrails of the Mad Musician.\n\nClouds which had been collecting in the sky began a splattering\ndownpour. The storm grew in fury and lightning tore the heavens, while\nthunder boomed and crackled. The rain began falling in sheets.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis served to revive the unconscious Teddy. He painfully withdrew his\nbody from under that of the madman. The falling rain, stained with the\nblood of the Mad Musician, trickled over the edge of the building.\n\nTeddy dragged himself through a window and passed his hand over his\nforehead, which was aching miserably. He tried to get to his feet and\nfell back, only to try again. Several times he tried and then, his\nstrength returning, he was able to walk.\n\nHe made his way to the studio where he had left Linane and found him\nthere surrounded by police, reporters and others. The infernal machine\nhad been rendered harmless, but was kept intact as evidence.\n\nCatching sight of Teddy, Linane shouted with joy. \"I stopped the damned\nthing,\" he chuckled, like a pleased schoolboy. Then, observing Teddy's\nexhausted condition he added:\n\n\"Why, you look like you have been to a funeral!\"\n\n\"I have,\" said Teddy. \"You'll find that crazy fiddler dead on the\ntwenty-ninth story. Look out the window of the thirtieth story,\" he\ninstructed the police, who had started to recover the body. \"He stabbed\nhimself. He is either dead or dying.\"\n\nIt proved that he was dead.\n\nNo engineering firm is responsible for the actions of a madman. So the\nMuller Construction Company was given a clean bill of health.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJenks and Elaine Linane were with the girl's father in his study. They\nwere asking for the paternal blessing.\n\nLinane was pretending to be hard to convince.\n\n\"Now, my daughter,\" he said, \"this young man takes $500 of my good money\nby sounding me out, as he calls it. Then he comes along and tries to\ntake my daughter away from me. It is positively high-handed. It dates\nback to the football game--\"\n\n\"Daddy, dear, don't be like that!\" said Elaine, who was on the arm of\nhis chair with her own arms around him.\n\n\"I tell you, Elaine, this dates back to the fall of 1927.\"\n\n\"It dates back to the fall of Eve,\" said Elaine. \"When a girl finds her\nman, no power can keep him from her. If you won't give me to Teddy\nJenks, I'll elope with him.\"\n\n\"Well, all right then.

They were gone!\n    And no one had been near!\n\n[Illustration: \"_That man never entered and stole that money as the\npicture shows, unless he managed to make himself invisible._\"]\n\n\nHarvey Winston, paying teller of the First National Bank of Chicago,\nstripped the band from a bundle of twenty dollar bills, counted out\nseventeen of them and added them to the pile on the counter before him.\n\n\"Twelve hundred and thirty-one tens,\" he read from the payroll change\nslip before him. The paymaster of the Cramer Packing Company nodded an\nassent and Winston turned to the stacked bills in his rear currency\nrack. He picked up a handful of bundles and turned back to the grill.\nHis gaze swept the counter where, a moment before, he had stacked the\ntwenties, and his jaw dropped.\n\n\"You got those twenties, Mr. Trier?\" he asked.\n\n\"Got them? Of course not, how could I?\" replied the paymaster. \"There\nthey are....\"\n\nHis voice trailed off into nothingness as he looked at the empty\ncounter.\n\n\"I must have dropped them,\" said Winston as he turned. He glanced back\nat the rear rack where his main stock of currency was piled. He stood\nparalyzed for a moment and then reached under the counter and pushed a\nbutton.\n\nThe bank resounded instantly to the clangor of gongs and huge steel\ngrills shot into place with a clang, sealing all doors and preventing\nanyone from entering or leaving the bank. The guards sprang to their\nstations with drawn weapons and from the inner offices the bank\nofficials came swarming out. The cashier, followed by two men, hurried\nto the paying teller's cage.\n\n\"What is it, Mr. Winston?\" he cried.\n\n\"I've been robbed!\" gasped the teller.\n\n\"Who by? How?\" demanded the cashier.\n\n\"I--I don't know, sir,\" stammered the teller. \"I was counting out Mr.\nTrier's payroll, and after I had stacked the twenties I turned to get\nthe tens. When I turned back the twenties were gone.\"\n\n\"Where had they gone?\" asked the cashier.\n\n\"I don't know, sir. Mr. Trier was as surprised as I was, and then I\nturned back, thinking that I had knocked them off the counter, and I saw\nat a glance that there was a big hole in my back racks. You can see\nyourself, sir.\"\n\nThe cashier turned to the paymaster.\n\n\"Is this a practical joke, Mr. Trier?\" he demanded sharply.\n\n\"Of course not,\" replied the paymaster. \"Winston's grill was closed. It\nstill is. Granted that I might have reached the twenties he had piled\nup, how could I have gone through a grill and taken the rest of the\nmissing money without his seeing me? The money disappeared almost\ninstantly. It was there a moment before, for I noticed when Winston\ntook the twenties from his rack that it was full.\"\n\n\"But someone must have taken it,\" said the bewildered cashier. \"Money\ndoesn't walk off of its own accord or vanish into thin air--\"\n\nA bell interrupted his speech.\n\n\"There are the police,\" he said with an air of relief. \"I'll let them\nin.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe smaller of the two men who had followed the cashier from his office\nwhen the alarm had sounded stepped forward and spoke quietly. His\nvoice was low and well pitched yet it carried a note of authority and\npower that held his auditors' attention while he spoke. The voice\nharmonized with the man. The most noticeable point about him was the\ninconspicuousness of his voice and manner, yet there was a glint of\nsteel in his gray eyes that told of enormous force in him.\n\n\"I don't believe that I would let them in for a few moments, Mr.\nRogers,\" he said. \"I think that we are up against something a little\ndifferent from the usual bank robbery.\"\n\n\"But, Mr. Carnes,\" protested the cashier, \"we must call in the police in\na case like this, and the sooner they take charge the better chance\nthere will be of apprehending the thief.\"\n\n\"Suit yourself,\" replied the little man with a shrug of his shoulders.\n\"I merely offered my advice.\"\n\n\"Will you take charge, Mr. Carnes?\" asked the cashier.\n\n\"I can't supersede the local authorities in a case like this,\" replied\nCarnes. \"The secret service is primarily interested in the suppression\nof counterfeiting and the enforcement of certain federal statutes, but I\nwill be glad to assist the local authorities to the best of my ability,\nprovided they desire my help. My advice to you would be to keep out the\npatrolmen who are demanding admittance and get in touch with the chief\nof police. I would ask that his best detective together with an expert\nfinger-print photographer be sent here before anyone else is admitted.\nIf the patrolmen are allowed to wipe their hands over Mr. Winston's\ncounter they may destroy valuable evidence.\"\n\n\"You are right, Mr. Carnes,\" exclaimed the cashier. \"Mr. Jervis, will\nyou tell the police that there is no violence threatening and ask them\nto wait for a few minutes? I'll telephone the chief of police at once.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs the cashier hurried away to his telephone Carnes turned to his\ncompanion who had stood an interested, although silent spectator of the\nscene. His companion was a marked contrast to the secret service\noperator. He stood well over six feet in height, and his protruding jaw\nand shock of unruly black hair combined with his massive shoulders and\nchest to give him the appearance of a man who labored with his\nhands--until one looked at them. His hands were in strange contrast to\nthe rest of him. Long, slim, mobile hands they were, with tapering\nnervous fingers--the hands of a thinker or of a musician. Telltale\nsplotches of acid told of hours spent in a laboratory, a tale that was\nconfirmed by the almost imperceptible stoop of his shoulders.\n\n\"Do you agree with my advice, Dr. Bird?\" asked Carnes deferentially.\n\nThe noted scientist, who from his laboratory in the Bureau of Standards\nhad sent forth many new things in the realms of chemistry and physics,\nand who, incidentally, had been instrumental in solving some of the most\nbaffling mysteries which the secret service had been called upon to\nface, grunted.\n\n\"It didn't do any harm,\" he said, \"but it is rather a waste of time. The\nthief wore gloves.\"\n\n\"How in thunder do you know that?\" demanded Carnes.\n\n\"It's merely common sense. A man who can do what he did had at least\nsome rudiments of intelligence, and even the feeblest-minded crooks know\nenough to wear gloves nowadays.\"\n\nCarnes stepped a little closer to the doctor.\n\n\"Another reason why I didn't want patrolmen tramping around,\" he said in\nan undertone, \"is this. If Winston gave the alarm quickly enough, the\nthief is probably still in the building.\"\n\n\"He's a good many miles away by now,\" replied Dr. Bird with a shrug of\nhis shoulders.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCarnes' eyes opened widely. \"Why?--how?--who?\" he stammered. \"Have you\nany idea of who did it, or how it was done?\"\n\n\"Possibly I have an idea,\" replied Dr. Bird with a cryptic smile. \"My\nadvice to you, Carnes, is to keep away from the local authorities as\nmuch as possible. I want to be present when Winston and Trier are\nquestioned and I may possibly wish to ask a few questions myself. Use\nyour authority that far, but no farther. Don't volunteer any information\nand especially don't let my name get out. We'll drop the counterfeiting\ncase we were summoned here on for the present and look into this a\nlittle on our own hook. I will want your aid, so don't get tied up with\nthe police.\"\n\n\"At that, we don't want the police crossing our trail at every turn,\"\nprotested Carnes.\n\n\"They won't,\" promised the doctor. \"They will never get any evidence on\nthis case, if I am right, and neither will we--for the present. Our\nstunt is to lie low and wait for the next attempt of this nature and\nthus accumulate some evidence and some idea of where to look.\"\n\n\"Will there be another attempt?\" asked Carnes.\n\n\"Surely. You don't expect a man who got away with a crime like this to\nquit operations just because a few flatfeet run around and make a\nhullabaloo about it, do you? I may be wrong in my assumption, but if I\nam right, the most important thing is to keep all reference to my name\nor position out of the press reports.\"\n\nThe cashier hastened up to them.\n\n\"Detective-Captain Sturtevant will be here in a few minutes with a\nphotographer and some other men,\" he said. \"Is there anything that we\ncan do in the meantime, Mr. Carnes?\"\n\n\"I would suggest that Mr. Trier and his guard and Mr. Winston go into\nyour office,\" replied Carnes. \"My assistant and I would like to be\npresent during the questioning, if there are no objections.\"\n\n\"I didn't know that you had an assistant with you,\" answered the\ncashier.\n\nCarnes indicated Dr. Bird.\n\n\"This gentleman is Mr. Berger, my assistant,\" he said. \"Do you\nunderstand?\"\n\n\"Certainly. I am sure there will be no objection to your presence, Mr.\nCarnes,\" replied the cashier as he led the way to his office.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA few minutes later Detective-Captain Sturtevant of the Chicago police\nwas announced. He acknowledged the introductions gruffly and got down to\nbusiness at once.\n\n\"What were the circumstances of the robbery?\" he asked.\n\nWinston told his story, Trier and the guard confirming it.\n\n\"Pretty thin!\" snorted the detective when they had finished. He whirled\nsuddenly on Winston.\n\n\"Where did you hide the loot?\" he thundered.\n\n\"Why--uh--er--what do you mean?\" gulped the teller.\n\n\"Just what I said,\" replied the detective. \"Where did you hide the\nloot?\"\n\n\"I didn't hide it anywhere,\" said the teller. \"It was stolen.\"\n\n\"You had better think up a better one,\" sneered Sturtevant. \"If you\nthink that you can make me believe that that money was stolen from you\nin broad daylight with two men in plain sight of you who didn't see it,\nyou might just as well get over it. I know that you have some hiding\nplace where you have slipped the stuff and the quicker you come clean\nand spill it, the better it will be for you. Where did you hide it?\"\n\n\"I didn't hide it!\" cried the teller, his voice trembling. \"Mr. Trier\ncan tell you that I didn't touch it from the time I laid it down until I\nturned back.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" replied the paymaster. \"He turned his back on me for a\nmoment, and when he turned back, it was gone.\"\n\n\"So you're in on it too, are you?\" said Sturtevant.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" demanded the paymaster hotly.\n\n\"Oh nothing, nothing at all,\" replied the detective. \"Of course Winston\ndidn't touch it and it disappeared and you never saw it go, although you\nwere within three feet of it all the time. Did _you_ see anything?\" he\ndemanded of the guard.\n\n\"Nothing that I am sure of,\" answered the guard. \"I thought that a\nshadow passed in front of me for an instant, but when I looked again, it\nwas gone.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Bird sat forward suddenly. \"What did this shadow look like?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"It wasn't exactly a shadow,\" said the guard. \"It was as if a person had\npassed suddenly before me so quickly that I couldn't see him. I seemed\nto feel that there was someone there, but I didn't rightly _see_\nanything.\"\n\n\"Did you notice anything of the sort?\" demanded the doctor of Trier.\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Trier thoughtfully. \"Now that Williams has\nmentioned it, I did seem to feel a breath of air or a motion as though\nsomething had passed in front of me. I didn't think of it at the time.\"\n\n\"Was this shadow opaque enough to even momentarily obscure your vision?\"\nwent on the doctor.\n\n\"Not that I am conscious of. It was just a breath of air such as a\nperson might cause by passing very rapidly.\"\n\n\"What made you ask Trier if he had the money when you turned around?\"\nasked the doctor of Winston.\n\n\"Say-y-y,\" broke in the detective. \"Who the devil are you, and what do\nyou mean by breaking into my examination and stopping it?\"\n\nCarnes tossed a leather wallet on the table.\n\n\"There are my credentials,\" he said in his quiet voice. \"I am chief of\none section of the United States Secret Service as you will see, and\nthis is Mr. Berger, my assistant. We were in the bank, engaged on a\ncounterfeiting case, when the robbery took place. We have had a good\ndeal of experience along these lines and we are merely anxious to aid\nyou.\"\n\nSturtevant examined Carnes' credentials carefully and returned them.\n\n\"This is a Chicago robbery,\" he said, \"and we have had a little\nexperience in robberies and in apprehending robbers ourselves. I think\nthat we can get along without your help.\"\n\n\"You have had more experience with robberies than with apprehending\nrobbers if the papers tell the truth,\" said Dr. Bird with a chuckle.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe detective's face flushed.\n\n\"That will be enough from you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\" he said. \"If you\nopen your mouth again, I'll arrest you as a material witness and as a\npossible accomplice.\"\n\n\"That sounds like Chicago methods,\" said Carnes quietly. \"Now listen to\nme, Captain. My assistant and I are merely trying to assist you in this\ncase. If you don't desire our assistance we'll proceed along our own\nlines without interfering, but in the meantime remember that this is a\nNational Bank, and that our questions will be answered. The United\nStates is higher than even the Chicago police force, and I am here under\norders to investigate a counterfeiting case. If I desire, I can seal the\ndoors of this bank and allow no one in or out until I have the evidence\nI desire. Do you understand?\"\n\nSturtevant sprang to his feet with an oath, but the sight of the gold\nbadge which Carnes displayed stopped him.\n\n\"Oh well,\" he said ungraciously. \"I suppose that no harm will come of\nletting Winston answer your fool questions, but I'll warn you that I'll\nreport to Washington that you are interfering with the course of justice\nand using your authority to aid the getaway of a criminal.\"\n\n\"That is your privilege,\" replied Carnes quietly. \"Mr. Winston, will you\nanswer Mr. Berger's question?\"\n\n\"Why, I asked him because he was right close to the money and I thought\nthat he might have reached through the wicket and picked it up. Then,\ntoo--\"\n\nHe hesitated for a moment and Dr. Bird smiled encouragingly.\n\n\"What else?\" he asked.\n\n\"Why, I can't exactly tell. It just seemed to me that I had heard the\nrustle that bills make when they are pulled across a counter. When I saw\nthem gone, I thought that he might have taken them. Then when I turned\ntoward him, I seemed to hear the rustle of bills behind me, although I\nknew that I was alone in the cage. When I looked back the money was\ngone.\"\n\n\"Did you see or hear anything like a shadow or a person moving?\"\n\n\"No--yes--I don't know. Just as I turned around it seemed to me that the\nrear door to my cage had moved and there may have been a shadow for an\ninstant. I don't know. I hadn't thought of it before.\"\n\n\"How long after that did you ring the alarm gongs?\"\n\n\"Not over a second or two.\"\n\n\"That's all,\" said Dr. Bird.\n\n\"If your high and mightiness has no further questions to ask, perhaps\nyou will let me ask a few,\" said Sturtevant.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Go ahead, ask all you wish,\" replied Dr. Bird with a laugh. \"I have all\nthe information I desire here for the present. I may want to ask other\nquestions later, but just now I think we'll be going.\"\n\n\"If you find any strange finger-prints on Winston's counter, I'll be\nglad to have them compared with our files,\" said Carnes.\n\n\"I am not bothering with finger-prints,\" snorted the detective. \"This is\nan open and shut case. There would be lots of Winston's finger-prints\nthere and no others. There isn't the slightest doubt that this is an\ninside case and I have the men I want right here. Mr. Rogers, your bank\nis closed for to-day. Everyone in it will be searched and then all those\nnot needed to close up will be sent away. I will get a squad of men here\nto go over your building and locate the hiding place. Your money is\nstill on the premises unless these men slipped it to a confederate who\ngot out before the alarm was given. I'll question the guards about that.\nIf that happened, a little sweating will get it out of them.\"\n\n\"Are you going to arrest me?\" demanded Trier in surprise.\n\n\"Yes, dearie,\" answered the detective. \"I am going to arrest you and\nyour two little playmates if these Washington experts will allow me to.\nYou will save a lot of time and quite a few painful experiences if you\nwill come clean now instead of later.\"\n\n\"I demand to see my lawyer and to communicate with my firm,\" said the\npaymaster.\n\n\"Time enough for that when I am through with you,\" replied the\ndetective.\n\nHe turned to Carnes.\n\n\"Have I your gracious permission to arrest these three criminals?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"Yes indeed, Captain,\" replied Carnes sweetly. \"You have my gracious\npermission to make just as big an ass of yourself as you wish. We're\ngoing now.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"By the way, Captain,\" said Dr. Bird as he followed Carnes out. \"When\nyou get through playing with your prisoners and start to look for the\nthief, here is a tip. Look for a left-handed man who has a thorough\nknowledge of chemistry and especially toxicology.\"\n\n\"It's easy enough to see that he was left-handed if he pulled that money\nout through the grill from the positions occupied by Trier and his\nguard, but what the dickens led you to suspect that he is a chemist and\na toxicologist?\" asked Carnes as he and the doctor left the bank.\n\n\"Merely a shrewd guess, my dear Watson,\" replied the doctor with a\nchuckle. \"I am likely to be wrong, but there is a good chance that I am\nright. I am judging solely from the method used.\"\n\n\"Have you solved the method?\" demanded Carnes in amazement. \"What on\nearth was it? The more I have thought about it, the more inclined I am\nto believe that Sturtevant is right and that it is an inside job. It\nseems to me impossible that a man could have entered in broad daylight\nand lifted that money in front of three men and within sight of a\nhundred more without some one getting a glimpse of him. He must have\ntaken the money out in a grip or a sack or something like that, yet the\nbank record shows that no one but Trier entered with a grip and no one\nleft with a package for ten minutes before Trier entered.\"\n\n\"There may be something in what you say, Carnes, but I am inclined to\nhave a different idea. I don't think it is the usual run of bank\nrobbery, and I would rather not hazard a guess just now. I am going back\nto Washington to-night. Before I go any further into the matter, I need\nsome rather specialized knowledge that I don't possess and I want to\nconsult with Dr. Knolles. I'll be back in a week or so and then we can\nlook into that counterfeiting case after we get this disposed of.\"\n\n\"What am I to do?\" asked Carnes.\n\n\"Sit around the lobby of your hotel, eat three meals a day, and read the\npapers. If you get bored, I would recommend that you pay a visit to the\nArt Institute and admire the graceful lions which adorn the steps.\nArtistic contemplations may well improve your culture.\"\n\n\"All right,\" replied Carnes. \"I'll assume a pensive air and moon at the\nlions, but I might do better if you told me what I was looking for.\"\n\n\"You are looking for knowledge, my dear Carnes,\" said the doctor with a\nlaugh. \"Remember the saying of the sages: To the wise man, no knowledge\nis useless.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA huge Martin bomber roared down to a landing at the Maywood airdrome,\nand a burly figure descended from the rear cockpit and waved his hand\njovially to the waiting Carnes. The secret service man hastened over to\ngreet his colleague.\n\n\"Have you got that truck I wired you to have ready?\" demanded the\ndoctor.\n\n\"Waiting at the entrance; but say, I've got some news for you.\"\n\n\"It can wait. Get a detail of men and help us to unload this ship. Some\nof the cases are pretty heavy.\"\n\nCarnes hurried off and returned with a gang of laborers, who took from\nthe bomber a dozen heavy packing cases of various sizes, several of them\nlabelled either \"Fragile\" or \"Inflammable\" in large type.\n\n\"Where do they go, Doctor?\" he asked when the last of them had been\nloaded onto the waiting truck.\n\n\"To the First National Bank,\" replied Dr. Bird, \"and Casey here goes\nwith them. You know Casey, don't you, Carnes? He is the best\nphotographer in the Bureau.\"\n\n\"Shall I go along too?\" asked Carnes as he acknowledged the\nintroduction.\n\n\"No need for it. I wired Rogers and he knows the stuff is coming and\nwhat to do with it. Unpack as soon as you get there, Casey, and start\nsetting up as soon as the bank closes.\"\n\n\"All right, Doctor,\" replied Casey as he mounted the truck beside the\ndriver.\n\n\"Where do we go, Doctor?\" asked Carnes as the truck rolled off.\n\n\"To the Blackstone Hotel for a bath and some clean clothes,\" replied the\ndoctor. \"And now, what is the news you have for me?\"\n\n\"The news is this, Doctor. I carried out your instructions diligently\nand, during the daylight hours, the lions have not moved.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Bird looked contrite.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Carnes,\" he said. \"I really didn't think when I left\nyou so mystified how you must have felt. Believe me, I had my own\nreasons, excellent ones, for secrecy.\"\n\n\"I have usually been able to maintain silence when asked to,\" replied\nCarnes stiffly.\n\n\"My dear fellow, I didn't mean to question your discretion. I know that\nwhatever I tell you is safe, but there are angles to this affair that\nare so weird and improbable that I don't dare to trust my own\nconclusions, let alone share them. I'll tell you all about it soon. Did\nyou get those tickets I wired for?\"\n\n\"Of course I got them, but what have two tickets to the A. A. U. track\nmeet this afternoon got to do with a bank robbery?\"\n\n\"One trouble with you, Carnes,\" replied the doctor with a judicial air,\n\"is that you have no idea of the importance of proper relaxation. Is it\npossible that you have no desire to see Ladd, this new marvel who is\nsmashing records right and left, run? He performs for the Illinois\nAthletic Club this afternoon, and it would not surprise me to see him\nlower the world's record again. He has already lowered the record for\nthe hundred yard dash from nine and three-fifths to eight and\nfour-fifths. There is no telling what he will do.\"\n\n\"Are we going to waste the whole afternoon just to watch a man run?\"\ndemanded Carnes in disgust.\n\n\"We will see many men run, my dear fellow, but there is only one in\nwhom I have a deep abiding interest, and that is Mr. Ladd. Have you\nyour binoculars with you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then by all means beg, borrow or steal two pairs before this afternoon.\nWe might easily miss half the fun without them. Are our seats near the\nstarting line for the sprints?\"\n\n\"Yes. The big demand was for seats near the finish line.\"\n\n\"The start will be much more interesting, Carnes. I was somewhat of a\nminor star in track myself in my college days and it will be of the\ngreatest interest to me to observe the starting form of this new speed\nartist. Now Carnes, don't ask any more questions. I may be barking up\nthe wrong tree and I don't want to give you a chance to laugh at me.\nI'll tell you what to watch for at the track.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sprinters lined up on the hundred yard mark and Dr. Bird and Carnes\nsat with their glasses glued to their eyes watching the slim figure in\nthe colors of the Illinois Athletic Club, whose large \"62\" on his back\nidentified him as the new star.\n\n\"On your mark!\" cried the starter. \"Get set!\"\n\n\"Ah!\" cried Dr. Bird. \"Did you see that Carnes?\"\n\nThe starting gun cracked and the runners were off on their short grind.\nLadd leaped into the lead and rapidly distanced the field, his legs\ntwinkling under him almost faster than the eye could follow. He was\nfully twenty yards in the lead when his speed suddenly lessened and the\nbalance of the runners closed up the gap he had opened. His lead was too\ngreat for them, and he was still a good ten yards in the lead when he\ncrossed the tape. The official time was posted as eight and nine-tenths\nseconds.\n\n\"Another thirty yards and he would have been beaten,\" said Carnes as he\nlowered his glasses.\n\n\"That is the way he has won all of his races,\" replied the doctor. \"He\npiles up a huge lead at first and then loses a good deal at the finish.\nHis speed doesn't hold up. Never mind that, though, it is only an\nadditional point in my favor. Did you notice his jaws just before the\ngun went?\"\n\n\"They seemed to clench and then he swallowed, but most of them did some\nthing like that.\"\n\n\"Watch him carefully for the next heat and see if he puts anything into\nhis mouth. That is the important thing.\"\n\nDr. Bird sank into a brown study and paid no attention to the next few\nevents, but he came to attention promptly when the final heat of the\nhundred yard dash was called. With his glasses he watched Ladd closely\nas the runner trotted up to the starting line.\n\n\"There, Carnes!\" he cried suddenly. \"Did you see?\"\n\n\"I saw him wipe his mouth,\" said Carnes doubtfully.\n\n\"All right, now watch his jaws just before the gun goes.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe final heat was a duplicate of the first preliminary. Ladd took an\nearly lead which he held for three-fourths of the distance to the tape,\nthen his pace slackened and he finished only a bare ten yards ahead of\nthe next runner. The time tied his previous world's record of eight and\nfour-fifths seconds.\n\n\"He crunched and swallowed all right, Doctor,\" said Carnes.\n\n\"That is all I wanted to be sure of. Now Carnes, here is something for\nyou to do. Get hold of the United States Commissioner and get a John Doe\nwarrant and go back to the hotel with it and wait for me. I may phone\nyou at any minute and I may not. If I don't, wait in your room until you\nhear from me. Don't leave it for a minute.\"\n\n\"Where are you going, Doctor?\"\n\n\"I'm going down and congratulate Mr. Ladd. An old track man like me\ncan't let such an opportunity pass.\"\n\n\"I don't know what this is all about, Doctor,\" replied Carnes, \"but I\nknow you well enough to obey orders and to keep my mouth shut until it\nis my turn to speak.\"\n\nFew men could resist Dr. Bird when he set out to make a favorable\nimpression, and even a world's champion is apt to be flattered by the\nattention of one of the greatest scientists of his day, especially when\nthat scientist has made an enviable reputation as an athlete in his\ncollege days and can talk the jargon of the champion's particular sport.\nHenry Ladd promptly capitulated to the charm of the doctor and allowed\nhimself to be led away to supper at Bird's club. The supper passed off\npleasantly, and when the doctor requested an interview with the young\nathlete in a private room, he gladly consented. They entered the room\ntogether, remained for an hour and a half, and then came out. The smile\nhad left Ladd's face and he appeared nervous and distracted. The doctor\ntalked cheerfully with him but kept a firm grip on his arm as they\ndescended the stairs together. They entered a telephone booth where the\ndoctor made several calls, and then descended to the street, where they\nentered a taxi.\n\n\"Maywood airdrome,\" the doctor told the driver.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwo hours later the big Martin bomber which had carried the doctor to\nChicago roared away into the night, and Bird turned back, reentered the\ntaxi, and headed for the city alone.\n\nWhen Carnes received the telephone call, which was one of those the\ndoctor made from the booth in his club, he hurried over to the First\nNational Bank. His badge secured him an entrance and he found Casey\nbusily engaged in rigging up an elaborate piece of apparatus on one of\nthe balconies where guards were normally stationed during banking hours.\n\n\"Dr. Bird said to tell you to keep on the job all night if necessary,\"\nhe told Casey. \"He thinks he will need your machine to-morrow.\"\n\n\"I'll have it ready to turn on the power at four A.M.,\" replied Casey.\n\nCarnes watched him curiously for a while as he soldered together the\nelectrical connections and assembled an apparatus which looked like a\nmotion picture projector.\n\n\"What are you setting up?\" he asked at length.\n\n\"It is a high speed motion picture camera,\" replied Casey, \"with a\ntelescopic lens. It is a piece of apparatus which Dr. Bird designed\nwhile he was in Washington last week and which I made from his sketches,\nusing some apparatus we had on hand. It's a dandy, all right.\"\n\n\"What is special about it?\"\n\n\"The speed. You know how fast an ordinary movie is taken, don't you? No?\nWell, it's sixteen exposures per second. The slow pictures are taken\nsometimes at a hundred and twenty-eight or two hundred and fifty-six\nexposures per second, and then shown at sixteen. This affair will take\nhalf a million pictures per second.\"\n\n\"I didn't know that a film would register with that short an exposure.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"That's slow,\" replied Casey with a laugh. \"It all depends on the light.\nThe best flash-light powder gives a flash about one ten-thousandth of a\nsecond in duration, but that is by no means the speed limit of the film.\nThe only trouble is enough light and sufficient shutter speed. Pictures\nhave been taken by means of spark photography with an exposure of less\nthan one three-millionth of a second. The whole secret of this machine\nlies in the shutter. This big disc with the slots in the edge is set up\nbefore the lens and run at such a speed that half a million slots per\nsecond pass before the lens. The film, which is sixteen millimeter\nX-ray film, travels behind the lens at a speed of nearly five miles per\nsecond. It has to be gradually worked up to this speed, and after the\nwhole thing is set up, it takes it nearly four hours to get to full\nspeed.\"\n\n\"At that speed, it must take a million miles of film before you get up\nsteam.\"\n\n\"It would, if the film were being exposed. There is only about a hundred\nyards of film all told, which will run over these huge drums in an\nendless belt. There is a regular camera shutter working on an electric\nprinciple which remains closed. When the switch is tripped, the shutter\nopens in about two thirty-thousandths of a second, stays open just one\none-hundredth of a second, and then closes. This time is enough to\nexpose nearly all of our film. When we have our picture, I shut the\ncurrent down, start applying a magnetic brake, and let it slow down. It\ntakes over an hour to stop it without breaking the film. It sounds\ncomplicated, but it works all right.\"\n\n\"Where is your switch?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"That is the trick part of it. It is a remote control affair. The\nshutter opens and starts the machine taking pictures when the back door\nof the paying teller's cage is opened half an inch. There is also a hand\nswitch in the line that can be opened so that you can open the door\nwithout setting off the camera, if you wish. When the hand switch is\nclosed and the door opened, this is what happens. The shutter on the\ncamera opens, the machine takes five thousand pictures during the next\nhundredth of a second, and then the shutter closes. Those five thousand\nexposures will take about five minutes to show at the usual rate of\nsixteen per second.\"\n\n\"You said that you had to get plenty of light. How are you managing\nthat?\"\n\n\"The camera is equipped with a special lens ground out of rock crystal.\nThis lens lets in ultra-violet light which the ordinary lens shuts out,\nand X-ray film is especially sensitive to ultra-violet light. In order\nto be sure that we get enough illumination, I will set up these two\nultra-violet floodlights to illumine the cage. The teller will have to\nwear glasses to protect his eyes and he'll get well sunburned, but\nsomething has to be sacrificed to science, as Dr. Bird is always telling\nme.\"\n\n\"It's too deep for me,\" said Carnes with a sigh. \"Can I do anything to\nhelp? The doctor told me to stand by and do anything I could.\"\n\n\"I might be able to use you a little if you can use tools,\" said Casey\nwith a grin. \"You can start bolting together that light proof shield if\nyou want to.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Well, Carnes, did you have an instructive night?\" asked Dr. Bird\ncheerfully as he entered the First National Bank at eight-thirty the\nnext morning.\n\n\"I don't see that I did much good, Doctor. Casey would have had the\nmachine ready on time anyway, and I'm no machinist.\"\n\n\"Well, frankly, Carnes, I didn't expect you to be of much help to him,\nbut I did want you to see what Casey was doing, and a little of it was\npretty heavy for him to handle alone. I suppose that everything is\nready?\"\n\n\"The motor reached full speed about fifteen minutes ago and Casey went\nout to get a cup of coffee. Would you mind telling me the object of the\nwhole thing?\"\n\n\"Not at all. I plan to make a permanent record of the work of the most\ningenious bank robber in the world. I hope he keeps his word.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Three days ago when Sturtevant sweated a 'confession' out of poor\nWinston, the bank got a message that the robbery would be repeated this\nmorning and dared them to prevent it. Rogers thought it was a hoax, but\nhe telephoned me and I worked the Bureau men night and day to get my\ncamera ready in time for him. I am afraid that I can't do much to\nprevent the robbery, but I may be able to take a picture of it and thus\nprevent other cases of a like nature.\"\n\n\"Was the warning written?\"\n\n\"No. It was telephoned from a pay station in the loop district, and by\nthe time it was traced and men got there, the telephoner was probably a\nmile away. He said that he would rob the same cage in the same manner as\nhe did before.\"\n\n\"Aren't you taking any special precautions?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, the bank is putting on extra guards and making a lot of fuss\nof that sort, probably to the great amusement of the robber.\"\n\n\"Why not close the cage for the day?\"\n\n\"Then he would rob a different one and we would have no way of\nphotographing his actions. To be sure, we will put dummy money there,\nbundles with bills on the outside and paper on the inside, so if I don't\nget a picture of him, he won't get much. Every bill in the cage will be\nmarked as well.\"\n\n\"Did he say at what time he would operate?\"\n\n\"No, he didn't, so we'll have to stand by all day. Oh, hello, Casey, is\neverything all right?\"\n\n\"As sweet as chocolate candy, Doctor. I have tested it out thoroughly,\nand unless we have to run it so long that the film wears out and breaks,\nwe are sitting pretty. If we don't get the pictures you are looking for,\nI'm a dodo, and I haven't been called that yet.\"\n\n\"Good work, Casey. Keep the bearings oiled and pray that the film\ndoesn't break.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe bank had been opened only ten minutes when the clangor of gongs\nannounced a robbery. It was practically a duplicate of the first. The\npaying teller had turned from his window to take some bills from his\nrack and had found several dozens of bundles missing. As the gongs\nsounded, Dr. Bird and Casey leaped to the camera.\n\n\"She snapped, Doctor!\" cried Casey as he threw two switches. \"It'll take\nan hour to stop and half a day to develop the film, but I ought to be\nable to show you what we got by to-night.\"\n\n\"Good enough!\" cried Dr. Bird. \"Go ahead while I try to calm down the\nbank officials. Will you have everything ready by eight o'clock?\"\n\n\"Easy, Doctor,\" replied Casey as he turned to the magnetic brake.\n\nBy eight o'clock quite a crowd had assembled in a private room at the\nBlackstone Hotel. Besides Dr. Bird and Carnes, Rogers and several other\nofficials of the First National Bank were present, together with\nDetective-Captain Sturtevant and a group of the most prominent\nscientists and physicians gathered from the schools of the city.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Dr. Bird when all had taken seats facing a miniature\nmoving picture screen on one wall, \"to-night I expect to show you some\npictures which will, I am sure, astonish you. It marks the advent of a\nnew departure in transcendental medicine. I will be glad to answer any\nquestions you may wish to ask and to explain the pictures after they are\nshown, but before we start a discussion, I will ask that you examine\nwhat I have to show you. Lights out, please!\"\n\nHe stepped to the rear of the room as the lights went out. As his eyes\ngrew used to the dimness of the room he moved forward and took a vacant\nseat. His hand fumbled in his pocket for a second.\n\n\"Now!\" he cried suddenly.\n\nIn the momentary silence which followed his cry, two dull metallic\nclicks could be heard, and a quick cry that was suddenly strangled as\nDr. Bird clamped his hand over the mouth of the man who sat between him\nand Carnes.\n\n\"All right, Casey,\" called the doctor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe whir of a projection machine could be heard and on the screen before\nthem leaped a picture of the paying teller's cage of the First National\nBank. Winston's successor was standing motionless at the wicket, his\nlips parted in a smile, but the attention of all was riveted on a figure\nwho moved at the back of the cage. As the picture started, the figure\nwas bent over an opened suitcase, stuffing into it bundles of bills. He\nstraightened up and reached to the rack for more bills, and as he did so\nhe faced the camera full for a moment. He picked up other bundles of\nbills, filled the suitcase, fastened it in a leisurely manner, opened\nthe rear door of the cage and walked out.\n\n\"Again, please!\" called Dr. Bird. \"And stop when he faces us full.\"\n\nThe picture was repeated and stopped at the point indicated.\n\n\"Lights, please!\" cried the doctor.\n\nThe lights flashed on and Dr. Bird rose to his feet, pulling up after\nhim the wilted figure of a middle-aged man.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said the doctor in ringing tones, \"allow me to present to\nyou Professor James Kirkwood of the faculty of the Richton University,\nformerly known as James Collier of the Bureau of Standards, and robber\nof the First National Bank.\"\n\nDetective-Captain Sturtevant jumped to his feet and cast a searching\nglance at the captive.\n\n\"He's the man all right,\" he cried. \"Hang on to him until I get a wagon\nhere!\"\n\n\"Oh, shut up!\" said Carnes. \"He's under federal arrest just now, charged\nwith the possession of narcotics. When we are through with him, you can\nhave him if you want him.\"\n\n\"How did you get that picture, Doctor?\" cried the cashier. \"I watched\nthat cage every minute during the morning and I'll swear that man never\nentered and stole that money as the picture shows, unless he managed to\nmake himself invisible.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You're closer to the truth than you suspect, Mr. Rogers,\" said Dr.\nBird. \"It is not quite a matter of invisibility, but something pretty\nclose to it. It is a matter of catalysts.\"\n\n\"What kind of cats?\" asked the cashier.\n\n\"Not cats, Mr. Rogers, catalysts. Catalysts is the name of a chemical\nreaction consisting essentially of a decomposition and a new combination\neffected by means of a catalyst which acts on the compound bodies in\nquestion, but which goes through the reaction itself unchanged. There\nare a great many of them which are used in the arts and in\nmanufacturing, and while their action is not always clearly understood,\nthe results are well known and can be banked on.\n\n\"One of the commonest instances of the use of a catalyst is the use of\nsponge platinum in the manufacture of sulphuric acid. I will not burden\nyou with the details of the 'contact' process, as it is known, but the\ncombination is effected by means of finely divided platinum which is\nneither changed, consumed or wasted during the process. While there are\na number of other catalysts known, for instance iron in reactions in\nwhich metallic magnesium is concerned, the commonest are the metals of\nthe platinum group.\n\n\"Less is known of the action of catalysts in the organic reactions, but\nit has been the subject of intensive study by Dr. Knolles of the Bureau\nof Standards for several years. His studies of the effects of different\ncolored lights, that is, rays of different wave-lengths, on the\nreactions which constitute growth in plants have had a great effect on\nhothouse forcing of plants and promise to revolutionize the truck\ngardening industry. He has speeded up the rate of growth to as high as\nten times the normal rate in some cases.\n\n\"A few years ago, he and his assistant, James Collier, turned their\nattention toward discovering a catalyst which would do for the metabolic\nreactions in animal life what his light rays did for plants. What his\nmethod was, I will not disclose for obvious reasons, but suffice it to\nsay that he met with great success. He took a puppy and by treating it\nwith his catalytic drugs, made it grow to maturity, pass through its\nentire normal life span, and die of old age in six months.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"That is very interesting, Doctor, but I fail to see what bearing it has\non the robbery.\"\n\n\"Mr. Rogers, how, on a dark day and in the absence of a timepiece, would\nyou judge the passage of time?\"\n\n\"Why, by my stomach, I guess.\"\n\n\"Exactly. By your metabolic rate. You eat a meal, it digests, you expend\nthe energy which you have taken into your system, your stomach becomes\nempty and your system demands more energy. You are hungry and you judge\nthat some five or six hours must have passed since you last ate. Do you\nfollow?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Let us suppose that by means of some tonic, some catalytic drug, your\nrate of metabolism and also your rate of expenditure of energy has been\nincreased six fold. You would eat a meal and in one hour you would be\nhungry again. Having no timepiece, and assuming that you were in a\nlight-proof room, you would judge that some five hours had passed, would\nyou not?\"\n\n\"I expect so.\"\n\n\"Very well. Now suppose that this accelerated rate of digestion and\nexpenditure of energy continued. You would be sleepy in perhaps three\nhours, would sleep about an hour and a quarter, and would then wake,\nready for your breakfast. In other words, you would have lived through a\nday in four hours.\"\n\n\"What advantage would there be in that?\"\n\n\"None, from your standpoint. It would, however, increase the rate of\nreproduction of cattle greatly and might be a great boom to agriculture,\nbut we will not discuss this phase now. Suppose it were possible to\nincrease your rate of metabolism and expenditure of energy, in other\nwords, your rate of living, not six times, but thirty thousand times. In\nsuch a case you would live five minutes in one one-hundredth of a\nsecond.\"\n\n\"Naturally, and you would live a year in about seventeen and one-half\nminutes, and a normal lifespan of seventy years in about twenty hours.\nYou would be as badly off as any common may-fly.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Agreed, but suppose that you could so regulate the dose of your\ncatalyst that its effect would last for only one one-hundredth of a\nsecond. During that short period of time, you would be able to do the\nwork that would ordinarily take you five minutes. In other words, you\ncould enter a bank, pack a satchel with currency and walk out. You would\nbe working in a leisurely manner, yet your actions would have been so\nquick that no human eye could have detected them. This is my theory of\nwhat actually took place. For verification, I will turn to Dr. Kirkwood,\nas he prefers to be known now.\"\n\n\"I don't know how you got that picture, but what you have said is about\nright,\" replied the prisoner.\n\n\"I got that picture by using a speed of thirty thousand times the normal\nsixteen exposures per second,\" replied Dr. Bird. \"That figure I got from\nDr. Knolles, the man who perfected the secret you stole when you left\nthe Bureau three years ago. You secured only part of it and I suppose it\ntook all your time since to perfect and complete it. You gave yourself\naway when you experimented on young Ladd. I was a track man myself in my\ncollege days and when I saw an account of his running, I smelt a rat, so\nI came back and watched him. As soon as I saw him crush and swallow a\ncapsule just as the gun was fired, I was sure, and got hold of him. He\nwas pretty stubborn, but he finally told me what name you were running\nunder now, and the rest was easy. I would have got you in time anyway,\nbut your bravado in telling us when you would next operate gave me the\nidea of letting you do it and photographing you at work. That is all I\nhave to say. Captain Sturtevant, you can take your prisoner whenever you\nwant him.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I reckoned without you, Dr. Bird, but the end hasn't come yet. You may\nsend me up for a few years, but you'll never find that money. I'm sure\nof that.\"\n\n\"Tut, tut, Professor,\" laughed Carnes. \"Your safety deposit box in the\nCommercial National is already sealed until a court orders it opened.\nThe bills you took this morning were all marked, so that is merely\nadditional proof, if we needed it. You surely didn't think that such a\ntransparent device as changing your name from 'James Collier' to 'John\nCollyer' and signing with your left hand instead of your right would\nfool the secret service, did you? Remember, your old Bureau records\nshowed you to be ambidextrous.\"\n\n\"What about Winston's confession?\" asked Rogers suddenly.\n\n\"Detective-Captain Sturtevant can explain that to a court when Mr.\nWinston brings suit against him for false arrest and brutal treatment,\"\nreplied Carnes.\n\n\"A very interesting case, Carnes,\" remarked the doctor a few hours\nlater. \"It was an enjoyable interlude in the routine of most of the\ncases on which you consult me, but our play time is over. We'll have to\nget after that counterfeiting case to-morrow.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIN THE NEXT ISSUE\n\n  BRIGANDS OF THE MOON\n  _Beginning an Amazing Four-part Interplanetary Novel_\n  By RAY CUMMINGS\n\n  THE SOUL MASTER\n  _A Thrilling Novelette of the Substitution of Personality_\n  By WILL SMITH and R.

Listerine\nShaving Cream]\n\n\n\"Pardon me, gentlemen!\"\n\n_Business men gargle daily to check colds and sore throat_\n\nWhy is Listerine to be found in the offices of a majority of American\nbusiness men? Why do they use it at the noon hour? Why do they sometimes\nhalt important meetings, to gargle with it?\n\nSimply because, like you, they recognize in this safe antiseptic a\nswift, effective enemy of sore throat and the common cold. Used at the\nfirst sign of trouble, it has prevented thousands of cases from becoming\nserious.\n\nIts effectiveness is due to its amazing power to destroy disease germs,\nmillions of which lodge in the oral cavity. Though safe to use and\npleasant to taste, full strength Listerine kills even such resistant\norganisms as the Staphylococcus Aureus (pus) and Bacillus Typhosus\n(typhoid) in counts ranging to 200,000,000 in 15 seconds. We could not\nmake this statement unless prepared to prove it to the entire\nsatisfaction of the medical profession and the U.S. Government.\n\nAs a preventive of sore throat and colds use Listerine systematically\nevery day. And at the first definite sign that either is developing,\nincrease the frequency of the gargle. You will be amazed to see how\nquickly the condition disappears.

I blamed old age, but it never occurred\nto me to actually fight back. I was only half-living, getting up nights\n... constipated ... constantly tormented by aches and pains. At 62 my\ncondition became almost intolerable. I had about given up hope when a\ndoctor recommended your treatment. Then at 63, it seemed that I shook\noff 20 years almost overnight.\"\n\n\n_Forty_--The Danger Age\n\nThese are the facts, just as I learned them. In 65% of all men, the\nvital prostate gland shows up soon after all. No pain is experienced,\nbut as this distressing condition continues, sciatica, backache, severe\nbladder weakness, constipation, etc., often develop.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nPROSTATE TROUBLE\n\nThese are frequently the signs of prostate trouble. Now thousands suffer\nthese handicaps needlessly! For a prominent American Scientist after\nseven years of research, discovered a new, safe way to stimulate the\nprostate gland to normal health and activity in many cases. This new\nhygiene is worthy to be called a notable achievement of the age.\n\n\nA National Institution for Men Past 40\n\nIts success has been startling, its growth rapid. This new hygiene is\nrapidly gaining in national prominence. The institution in Steubenville\nhas now reached large proportions. Scores and even hundreds of letters\npour in every day, and in many cases reported results have been little\nshort of amazing. In case after case, men have reported that they have\nfelt ten years younger in six days. Now physicians in every part of the\ncountry are using and recommending this treatment.\n\nQuick as is the response to this new hygiene, it is actually a pleasant,\nnatural relaxation, involving no drugs, medicine or electric rays\nwhatever. The scientist explains this discovery and tells why many men\nare old at forty in a new book now sent free, in 24-page, illustrated\nform. Send for it.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
