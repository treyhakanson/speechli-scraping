On the screen, a news commentator was summarizing\nthe day's happenings. Every thirty seconds or so, Gramps would jab the\nfloor with his cane-tip and shout, \"Hell, we did that a hundred years\nago!\"\n\nEmerald and Lou, coming in from the balcony, where they had been seeking\nthat 2185 A.D. rarity--privacy--were obliged to take seats in the back\nrow, behind Lou's father and mother, brother and sister-in-law, son and\ndaughter-in-law, grandson and wife, granddaughter and husband,\ngreat-grandson and wife, nephew and wife, grandnephew and wife,\ngreat-grandniece and husband, great-grandnephew and wife--and, of\ncourse, Gramps, who was in front of everybody. All save Gramps, who was\nsomewhat withered and bent, seemed, by pre-anti-gerasone standards, to\nbe about the same age--somewhere in their late twenties or early\nthirties. Gramps looked older because he had already reached 70 when\nanti-gerasone was invented. He had not aged in the 102 years since.\n\n\"Meanwhile,\" the commentator was saying, \"Council Bluffs, Iowa, was\nstill threatened by stark tragedy. But 200 weary rescue workers have\nrefused to give up hope, and continue to dig in an effort to save Elbert\nHaggedorn, 183, who has been wedged for two days in a ...\"\n\n\"I wish he'd get something more cheerful,\" Emerald whispered to Lou.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Silence!\" cried Gramps. \"Next one shoots off his big bazoo while the\nTV's on is gonna find hisself cut off without a dollar--\" his voice\nsuddenly softened and sweetened--\"when they wave that checkered flag at\nthe Indianapolis Speedway, and old Gramps gets ready for the Big Trip Up\nYonder.\"\n\nHe sniffed sentimentally, while his heirs concentrated desperately on\nnot making the slightest sound. For them, the poignancy of the\nprospective Big Trip had been dulled somewhat, through having been\nmentioned by Gramps about once a day for fifty years.\n\n\"Dr. Brainard Keyes Bullard,\" continued the commentator, \"President of\nWyandotte College, said in an address tonight that most of the world's\nills can be traced to the fact that Man's knowledge of himself has not\nkept pace with his knowledge of the physical world.\"\n\n\"_Hell!_\" snorted Gramps. \"We said _that_ a hundred years ago!\"\n\n\"In Chicago tonight,\" the commentator went on, \"a special celebration is\ntaking place in the Chicago Lying-in Hospital. The guest of honor\nis Lowell W. Hitz, age zero. Hitz, born this morning, is the\ntwenty-five-millionth child to be born in the hospital.\" The commentator\nfaded, and was replaced on the screen by young Hitz, who squalled\nfuriously.\n\n\"Hell!\" whispered Lou to Emerald. \"We said that a hundred years ago.\"\n\n\"I heard that!\" shouted Gramps. He snapped off the television set and\nhis petrified descendants stared silently at the screen. \"You, there,\nboy--\"\n\n\"I didn't mean anything by it, sir,\" said Lou, aged 103.\n\n\"Get me my will. You know where it is. You kids _all_ know where it is.\nFetch, boy!\" Gramps snapped his gnarled fingers sharply.\n\nLou nodded dully and found himself going down the hall, picking his way\nover bedding to Gramps' room, the only private room in the Ford\napartment. The other rooms were the bathroom, the living room and the\nwide windowless hallway, which was originally intended to serve as a\ndining area, and which had a kitchenette in one end. Six mattresses and\nfour sleeping bags were dispersed in the hallway and living room, and\nthe daybed, in the living room, accommodated the eleventh couple, the\nfavorites of the moment.\n\nOn Gramps' bureau was his will, smeared, dog-eared, perforated and\nblotched with hundreds of additions, deletions, accusations, conditions,\nwarnings, advice and homely philosophy. The document was, Lou reflected,\na fifty-year diary, all jammed onto two sheets--a garbled, illegible log\nof day after day of strife. This day, Lou would be disinherited for the\neleventh time, and it would take him perhaps six months of impeccable\nbehavior to regain the promise of a share in the estate. To say nothing\nof the daybed in the living room for Em and himself.\n\n\"Boy!\" called Gramps.\n\n\"Coming, sir.\" Lou hurried back into the living room and handed Gramps\nthe will.\n\n\"Pen!\" said Gramps.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was instantly offered eleven pens, one from each couple.\n\n\"Not _that_ leaky thing,\" he said, brushing Lou's pen aside. \"Ah,\n_there's_ a nice one. Good boy, Willy.\" He accepted Willy's pen. That\nwas the tip they had all been waiting for. Willy, then--Lou's\nfather--was the new favorite.\n\nWilly, who looked almost as young as Lou, though he was 142, did a poor\njob of concealing his pleasure. He glanced shyly at the daybed, which\nwould become his, and from which Lou and Emerald would have to move back\ninto the hall, back to the worst spot of all by the bathroom door.\n\nGramps missed none of the high drama he had authored and he gave his own\nfamiliar role everything he had. Frowning and running his finger along\neach line, as though he were seeing the will for the first time, he read\naloud in a deep portentous monotone, like a bass note on a cathedral\norgan.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"I, Harold D. Ford, residing in Building 257 of Alden Village, New York\nCity, Connecticut, do hereby make, publish and declare this to be my\nlast Will and Testament, revoking any and all former wills and\ncodicils by me at any time heretofore made.\" He blew his nose\nimportantly and went on, not missing a word, and repeating many for\nemphasis--repeating in particular his ever-more-elaborate specifications\nfor a funeral.\n\nAt the end of these specifications, Gramps was so choked with emotion\nthat Lou thought he might have forgotten why he'd brought out the will\nin the first place. But Gramps heroically brought his powerful emotions\nunder control and, after erasing for a full minute, began to write and\nspeak at the same time. Lou could have spoken his lines for him, he had\nheard them so often.\n\n\"I have had many heartbreaks ere leaving this vale of tears for a better\nland,\" Gramps said and wrote. \"But the deepest hurt of all has been\ndealt me by--\" He looked around the group, trying to remember who the\nmalefactor was.\n\nEveryone looked helpfully at Lou, who held up his hand resignedly.\n\nGramps nodded, remembering, and completed the sentence--\"my\ngreat-grandson, Louis J. Ford.\"\n\n\"Grandson, sir,\" said Lou.\n\n\"Don't quibble. You're in deep enough now, young man,\" said Gramps, but\nhe made the change. And, from there, he went without a misstep through\nthe phrasing of the disinheritance, causes for which were\ndisrespectfulness and quibbling.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the paragraph following, the paragraph that had belonged to everyone\nin the room at one time or another, Lou's name was scratched out and\nWilly's substituted as heir to the apartment and, the biggest plum of\nall, the double bed in the private bedroom.\n\n\"So!\" said Gramps, beaming. He erased the date at the foot of the will\nand substituted a new one, including the time of day. \"Well--time to\nwatch the McGarvey Family.\" The McGarvey Family was a television serial\nthat Gramps had been following since he was 60, or for a total of 112\nyears. \"I can't wait to see what's going to happen next,\" he said.\n\nLou detached himself from the group and lay down on his bed of pain by\nthe bathroom door. Wishing Em would join him, he wondered where she was.\n\nHe dozed for a few moments, until he was disturbed by someone stepping\nover him to get into the bathroom. A moment later, he heard a faint\ngurgling sound, as though something were being poured down the washbasin\ndrain. Suddenly, it entered his mind that Em had cracked up, that she\nwas in there doing something drastic about Gramps.\n\n\"Em?\" he whispered through the panel. There was no reply, and Lou\npressed against the door. The worn lock, whose bolt barely engaged its\nsocket, held for a second, then let the door swing inward.\n\n\"Morty!\" gasped Lou.\n\nLou's great-grandnephew, Mortimer, who had just married and brought his\nwife home to the Ford menage, looked at Lou with consternation and\nsurprise. Morty kicked the door shut, but not before Lou had glimpsed\nwhat was in his hand--Gramps' enormous economy-size bottle of\nanti-gerasone, which had apparently been half-emptied, and which Morty\nwas refilling with tap water.\n\nA moment later, Morty came out, glared defiantly at Lou and brushed past\nhim wordlessly to rejoin his pretty bride.\n\nShocked, Lou didn't know what to do. He couldn't let Gramps take the\nmousetrapped anti-gerasone--but, if he warned Gramps about it, Gramps\nwould certainly make life in the apartment, which was merely\ninsufferable now, harrowing.\n\nLou glanced into the living room and saw that the Fords, Emerald among\nthem, were momentarily at rest, relishing the botches that the McGarveys\nhad made of _their_ lives. Stealthily, he went into the bathroom, locked\nthe door as well as he could and began to pour the contents of Gramps'\nbottle down the drain. He was going to refill it with full-strength\nanti-gerasone from the 22 smaller bottles on the shelf.\n\nThe bottle contained a half-gallon, and its neck was small, so it seemed\nto Lou that the emptying would take forever. And the almost\nimperceptible smell of anti-gerasone, like Worcestershire sauce, now\nseemed to Lou, in his nervousness, to be pouring out into the rest of\nthe apartment, through the keyhole and under the door.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe bottle gurgled monotonously. Suddenly, up came the sound of music\nfrom the living room and there were murmurs and the scraping of\nchair-legs on the floor. \"Thus ends,\" said the television announcer,\n\"the 29,121st chapter in the life of your neighbors and mine, the\nMcGarveys.\" Footsteps were coming down the hall. There was a knock on\nthe bathroom door.\n\n\"Just a sec,\" Lou cheerily called out. Desperately, he shook the big\nbottle, trying to speed up the flow. His palms slipped on the wet glass,\nand the heavy bottle smashed on the tile floor.\n\nThe door was pushed open, and Gramps, dumbfounded, stared at the\nincriminating mess.\n\nLou felt a hideous prickling sensation on his scalp and the back of his\nneck. He grinned engagingly through his nausea and, for want of anything\nremotely resembling a thought, waited for Gramps to speak.\n\n\"Well, boy,\" said Gramps at last, \"looks like you've got a little\ntidying up to do.\"\n\nAnd that was all he said. He turned around, elbowed his way through the\ncrowd and locked himself in his bedroom.\n\nThe Fords contemplated Lou in incredulous silence a moment longer, and\nthen hurried back to the living room, as though some of his horrible\nguilt would taint them, too, if they looked too long. Morty stayed\nbehind long enough to give Lou a quizzical, annoyed glance. Then he also\nwent into the living room, leaving only Emerald standing in the doorway.\n\nTears streamed over her cheeks. \"Oh, you poor lamb--_please_ don't look\nso awful! It was my fault. I put you up to this with my nagging about\nGramps.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Lou, finding his voice, \"really you didn't. Honest, Em, I was\njust--\"\n\n\"You don't have to explain anything to me, hon. I'm on your side, no\nmatter what.\" She kissed him on one cheek and whispered in his ear, \"It\nwouldn't have been murder, hon. It wouldn't have killed him. It wasn't\nsuch a terrible thing to do. It just would have fixed him up so he'd be\nable to go any time God decided He wanted him.\"\n\n\"What's going to happen next, Em?\" said Lou hollowly. \"What's he going\nto do?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLou and Emerald stayed fearfully awake almost all night, waiting to see\nwhat Gramps was going to do. But not a sound came from the sacred\nbedroom. Two hours before dawn, they finally dropped off to sleep.\n\nAt six o'clock, they arose again, for it was time for their generation\nto eat breakfast in the kitchenette. No one spoke to them. They had\ntwenty minutes in which to eat, but their reflexes were so dulled by the\nbad night that they had hardly swallowed two mouthfuls of egg-type\nprocessed seaweed before it was time to surrender their places to their\nson's generation.\n\nThen, as was the custom for whoever had been most recently disinherited,\nthey began preparing Gramps' breakfast, which would presently be served\nto him in bed, on a tray. They tried to be cheerful about it. The\ntoughest part of the job was having to handle the honest-to-God eggs and\nbacon and oleomargarine, on which Gramps spent so much of the income\nfrom his fortune.\n\n\"Well,\" said Emerald, \"I'm not going to get all panicky until I'm sure\nthere's something to be panicky about.\"\n\n\"Maybe he doesn't know what it was I busted,\" Lou said hopefully.\n\n\"Probably thinks it was your watch crystal,\" offered Eddie, their son,\nwho was toying apathetically with his buckwheat-type processed sawdust\ncakes.\n\n\"Don't get sarcastic with your father,\" said Em, \"and don't talk with\nyour mouth full, either.\"\n\n\"I'd like to see anybody take a mouthful of this stuff and _not_ say\nsomething,\" complained Eddie, who was 73. He glanced at the clock. \"It's\ntime to take Gramps his breakfast, you know.\"\n\n\"Yeah, it is, isn't it?\" said Lou weakly. He shrugged. \"Let's have the\ntray, Em.\"\n\n\"We'll both go.\"\n\nWalking slowly, smiling bravely, they found a large semi-circle of\nlong-faced Fords standing around the bedroom door.\n\nEm knocked. \"Gramps,\" she called brightly, \"_break_-fast is _rea_-dy.\"\n\nThere was no reply and she knocked again, harder.\n\nThe door swung open before her fist. In the middle of the room, the\nsoft, deep, wide, canopied bed, the symbol of the sweet by-and-by to\nevery Ford, was empty.\n\nA sense of death, as unfamiliar to the Fords as Zoroastrianism or the\ncauses of the Sepoy Mutiny, stilled every voice, slowed every heart.\nAwed, the heirs began to search gingerly, under the furniture and behind\nthe drapes, for all that was mortal of Gramps, father of the clan.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut Gramps had left not his Earthly husk but a note, which Lou finally\nfound on the dresser, under a paperweight which was a treasured souvenir\nfrom the World's Fair of 2000. Unsteadily, Lou read it aloud:\n\n\"'Somebody who I have sheltered and protected and taught the best I know\nhow all these years last night turned on me like a mad dog and diluted\nmy anti-gerasone, or tried to. I am no longer a young man. I can no\nlonger bear the crushing burden of life as I once could. So, after last\nnight's bitter experience, I say good-by. The cares of this world will\nsoon drop away like a cloak of thorns and I shall know peace. By the\ntime you find this, I will be gone.'\"\n\n\"Gosh,\" said Willy brokenly, \"he didn't even get to see how the\n5000-mile Speedway Race was going to come out.\"\n\n\"Or the Solar Series,\" Eddie said, with large mournful eyes.\n\n\"Or whether Mrs. McGarvey got her eyesight back,\" added Morty.\n\n\"There's more,\" said Lou, and he began reading aloud again: \"'I, Harold\nD. Ford, etc., do hereby make, publish and declare this to be my last\nWill and Testament, revoking any and all former wills and codicils by me\nat any time heretofore made.'\"\n\n\"No!\" cried Willy. \"Not another one!\"\n\n\"'I do stipulate,'\" read Lou, \"'that all of my property, of whatsoever\nkind and nature, not be divided, but do devise and bequeath it to be\nheld in common by my issue, without regard for generation, equally,\nshare and share alike.'\"\n\n\"Issue?\" said Emerald.\n\nLou included the multitude in a sweep of his hand. \"It means we all own\nthe whole damn shootin' match.\"\n\nEach eye turned instantly to the bed.\n\n\"Share and share alike?\" asked Morty.\n\n\"Actually,\" said Willy, who was the oldest one present, \"it's just like\nthe old system, where the oldest people head up things with their\nheadquarters in here and--\"\n\n\"I like _that_!\" exclaimed Em. \"Lou owns as much of it as you do, and I\nsay it ought to be for the oldest one who's still working. You can\nsnooze around here all day, waiting for your pension check, while poor\nLou stumbles in here after work, all tuckered out, and--\"\n\n\"How about letting somebody who's never had _any_ privacy get a little\ncrack at it?\" Eddie demanded hotly. \"Hell, you old people had plenty of\nprivacy back when you were kids. I was born and raised in the middle of\nthat goddamn barracks in the hall! How about--\"\n\n\"Yeah?\" challenged Morty. \"Sure, you've all had it pretty tough, and my\nheart bleeds for you. But try honeymooning in the hall for a real kick.\"\n\n\"_Silence!_\" shouted Willy imperiously. \"The next person who opens his\nmouth spends the next sixth months by the bathroom. Now clear out of my\nroom. I want to think.\"\n\nA vase shattered against the wall, inches above his head.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the next moment, a free-for-all was under way, with each couple\nbattling to eject every other couple from the room. Fighting coalitions\nformed and dissolved with the lightning changes of the tactical\nsituation. Em and Lou were thrown into the hall, where they organized\nothers in the same situation, and stormed back into the room.\n\nAfter two hours of struggle, with nothing like a decision in sight, the\ncops broke in, followed by television cameramen from mobile units.\n\nFor the next half-hour, patrol wagons and ambulances hauled away Fords,\nand then the apartment was still and spacious.\n\nAn hour later, films of the last stages of the riot were being televised\nto 500,000,000 delighted viewers on the Eastern Seaboard.\n\nIn the stillness of the three-room Ford apartment on the 76th floor of\nBuilding 257, the television set had been left on. Once more the air was\nfilled with the cries and grunts and crashes of the fray, coming\nharmlessly now from the loudspeaker.\n\nThe battle also appeared on the screen of the television set in the\npolice station, where the Fords and their captors watched with\nprofessional interest.\n\nEm and Lou, in adjacent four-by-eight cells, were stretched out\npeacefully on their cots.\n\n\"Em,\" called Lou through the partition, \"you got a washbasin all your\nown, too?\"\n\n\"Sure. Washbasin, bed, light--the works. And we thought _Gramps'_ room\nwas something. How long has this been going on?\" She held out her hand.\n\"For the first time in forty years, hon, I haven't got the shakes--look\nat me!\"\n\n\"Cross your fingers,\" said Lou. \"The lawyer's going to try to get us a\nyear.\"\n\n\"Gee!\" Em said dreamily. \"I wonder what kind of wires you'd have to pull\nto get put away in solitary?\"\n\n\"All right, pipe down,\" said the turnkey, \"or I'll toss the whole kit\nand caboodle of you right out. And first one who lets on to anybody\noutside how good jail is ain't never getting back in!\"\n\nThe prisoners instantly fell silent.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe living room of the apartment darkened for a moment as the riot\nscenes faded on the television screen, and then the face of the\nannouncer appeared, like the Sun coming from behind a cloud. \"And now,\nfriends,\" he said, \"I have a special message from the makers of\nanti-gerasone, a message for all you folks over 150. Are you hampered\nsocially by wrinkles, by stiffness of joints and discoloration or loss\nof hair, all because these things came upon you before anti-gerasone was\ndeveloped? Well, if you are, you need no longer suffer, need no longer\nfeel different and out of things.\n\n\"After years of research, medical science has now developed\n_Super_-anti-gerasone! In weeks--yes, weeks--you can look, feel and act\nas young as your great-great-grandchildren! Wouldn't you pay $5,000 to\nbe indistinguishable from everybody else? Well, you don't have to. Safe,\ntested _Super_-anti-gerasone costs you only a few dollars a day.\n\n\"Write now for your free trial carton. Just put your name and address on\na dollar postcard, and mail it to '_Super_,' Box 500,000, Schenectady,\nN. Y. Have you got that? I'll repeat it. '_Super_,' Box 500,000 ...\"\n\nUnderlining the announcer's words was the scratching of Gramps' pen, the\none Willy had given him the night before. He had come in, a few minutes\nearlier, from the Idle Hour Tavern, which commanded a view of Building\n257 from across the square of asphalt known as the Alden Village Green.\nHe had called a cleaning woman to come straighten the place up, then had\nhired the best lawyer in town to get his descendants a conviction, a\ngenius who had never gotten a client less than a year and a day. Gramps\nhad then moved the daybed before the television screen, so that he could\nwatch from a reclining position. It was something he'd dreamed of doing\nfor years.\n\n\"Schen-_ec_-ta-dy,\" murmured Gramps. \"Got it!\" His face had changed\nremarkably. His facial muscles seemed to have relaxed, revealing\nkindness and equanimity under what had been taut lines of bad temper. It\nwas almost as though his trial package of _Super_-anti-gerasone had\nalready arrived. When something amused him on television, he smiled\neasily, rather than barely managing to lengthen the thin line of his\nmouth a millimeter.\n\nLife was good. He could hardly wait to see what was going to happen\nnext.\n\n                                                  --KURT VONNEGUT, JR.\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Galaxy Science Fiction_ January 1954.\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
