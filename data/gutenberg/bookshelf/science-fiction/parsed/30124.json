Hall_\n\n[Illustration: _\"Hay crosses the gulf, taking with him the cord which\ncontrols the electro-magnet.\"_ ]\n\nPART I\n\n[Sidenote: The story of the \"Torpedo Plan\" and of Capt. Lance's heroic\npart in America's last mighty battle with the United Slavs.]\n\n\nTrapped again!\n\nBut this time, Lance swore, they'd not get away without paying dearly\nfor it!\n\nUnder the mesh of his gas-mask the lean lines of his jaw went taut.\nTense, steely fingers flipped to the knobbed control instruments; the\ngleaming single-seater scout plane catapulted in a screaming\nsomersault. Lance's ever-wary sixth sense told him the tongues of\ndisintegrating flame had licked the plane's protected belly, and for\nthe fact that it was protected he thanked again his stupendous luck.\nHe pulled savagely at the squat control stick; the four Rahl-Diesels\nunleashed a torrent of power; and the slim scout rose like a comet,\nand hurtled, the altitude dial's nervous finger proclaimed, to ten\nthousand feet. Lance eased off the power, relaxed slightly, and\nglanced below.\n\nThey'd started off a squadron of fifteen planes. Thirteen had crumpled\nbeneath that treacherous, stabbing curtain of disintegrating flame.\nOnly two of them were left--he and Praed.\n\nPraed, of course!\n\nThe fellow's plane was pirouetting nearby. Lance was the squadron\nleader. He jammed his thin-lipped mouth close to the \"mike\" and\nrasped:\n\n\"They trapped us again! There's some damn spy at our base. Stand by,\nPraed! They'll send up a few men to wipe us out, too ... and we're\ngoin' to square the account!\"\n\nHe listened for Praed's answer. Presently it came.\n\n\"I can't! They got two of my motors. I'm limping badly. We'd better\nbeat it while we can.\"\n\nLance's mouth curled. He roared:\n\n\"Go on, then, beat it! But I'm goin' to take a couple of 'em, anyway.\"\nDisgusted, filled with red anger, he flung the phones from his head,\nwatched Praed's plane whirl its stubby nose for home, settled himself\nalertly in the low, padded seat and concentrated his attention on the\nground below.\n\nHe'd been right. Tiny, gray-clad figures were pouring from their\nbarracks, rushing madly towards the dozen or so planes neatly drawn up\non the field. Lance's mouth twitched. They probably wondered, down\nthere, why the devil he didn't beat it--like Praed! He stroked the\nlever which controlled his five gas bombs, centered his battery of\nincendiary-bullet machine-guns and ruthlessly shoved the control stick\nfull over.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Rahl-Diesels pumped at full power; his plane plummetted downwards\nwith the speed of light, a hurtling shell of steel. His unexpected\nmove took the men below by surprise. Lance knew they needed at least\nten minutes to prepare another salvo of disintegrating flame; he had\nabout four minutes left.\n\nThere was a restless, thudding chatter, and his bullets began to mow\nthem down.\n\nLance could see the horrified expressions of the men beneath, and\nchuckled grimly as they sought to escape the wrath of his hot guns. He\nflung bursts of spouting, acid-filled lead at the defenseless planes,\nand saw two of them collapse in shrouds of acrid white smoke. And\nstill he dove.\n\nAt a bare one hundred feet he tugged the control stick back, and the\ntiny scout groaned under the pull of her motors. Then her snout jolted\nupwards. Lance pounded the gas bomb lever, and smiled a tight smile as\nhe sensed the five pills sloping down from their compartment in the\nscout's belly.\n\nA second later came a rolling, ear-numbing crash. Lance, safe at a\nperch of a few thousand feet, grinned as his narrowed eyes beheld the\nsticky curtain of death-crammed gas hug over the enemy base.\n\n\"That'll quiet 'em for a few minutes!\" he muttered savagely.\n\nA few minutes--but not more. And he had no more bombs; his ammunition\nbelts were nearly depleted. \"I guess,\" he murmured, \"I'd better follow\nthat quitter, Praed. I've paid 'em for the boys they got, anyway!\"\n\nHe levelled the plane out, threw a last glance at the carpet of gas he\nhad laid, and spurred the purring Rahl-Diesels to their limit. His\nspeed dial flashed round to five hundred, five-fifty--seventy--and\nfinally rested, quivering, at the scout's full six hundred miles per\nhour.\n\nUnder the streamlined plane's speeding body the gnarled, bomb-torn\nterrain of Nevada hurtled by. A rather sad frown creased Lance's\nprematurely old brow as he glimpsed it. Thousands of lives had been\nthrown into that ground; the hot, tumbled waste was doused with\nfreely-sacrificed blood, the blood of whole regiments of America's\nheroic First Home Army. Martyred men! Lance couldn't help swearing to\nhimself at the bitter thought of that terrible reckoning day. It was\nthe price his country had paid for her continued ignoring of the\nfestering peril overseas. Slaughtered like sheep, those glorious\nregiments had been! Helpless, almost, before the ultra-modern war\nweapons of the United Slav hordes, they'd stopped the numbingly quick\nadvance merely by the weight of their bodies. Like little Belgium, in\n1914. They'd held the Slavs to California, ravished, war-desolated\nCalifornia.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe thin front-line trenches far behind, Lance began a slanting dive\nthat raised his speed well over six hundred. Through the front\nmagnifying mirror he spied the squat khaki buildings of his base.\nWerewolves of War, the batch of planes he belonged to had been\nchristened, and it was a richly deserved title. In front of the front\nthey fought, detailed to desperate, harrying missions, losing an\naverage of ten men a day. The ordeal of gas and fire and acid bullets\nadded five years to a man's brow overnight--if he served with the\nWerewolves of War.\n\nLance was only twenty-four, but his hair was splotched with dead gray\nstrands; his eyes were hard and weary; his face lined with new\nwrinkles. Ah, well, it was war--and a losing war, he had to admit,\nthat they fought. If a miracle didn't come, America would crumble even\nas old Europe had, before the overwhelming Slavish troops.\n\nEven now, as Lance knew through various rumors, the Slavs were massed\nfor a grand attack. And with what could America hold them back?\n\nHis helicopter props spun, and the scout nestled down lightly on the\ntarmac. Lance switched off the faithful Rahl-Diesels, swung open the\ntiny door and leaped from the enclosed cockpit.\n\n\"Sir,\" he rapped to thin, stern-browed Colonel Douglas, \"there's no\nlonger any doubt in my mind. This is the fifth time we've been\nanticipated--trapped! The enemy is informed directly of the attacking\nplans of our scout details. There's a spy at this base!\" He lowered\nhis eyes for a second and said in a queer tone of voice: \"Thirteen of\n'em went down to-day.\"\n\nColonel Douglas' tired face showed the never-ceasing strain he was\nunder. He clasped hands behind his back, took a few nervous turns up\nand down the small office and finally, with a somewhat hopeless sigh,\nmuttered:\n\n\"I know, Lance, I know. The devils! They seem to be aware of\neverything we plan. Yet what can we do? Look at the territory our\nfront lines cover! More than two thousand miles of loosely held\nground. And we're so damnably organized, man! Look here!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe strode to the huge map which covered entirely one wall of the\nlittle room and ran his forefinger down the long red line, signifying\nthe American front, which stretched crookedly from the Canadian border\nto the Gulf of California. Parallel to it was another line, of\nblack--the United Slavs.\n\n\"It's so damned easy,\" Colonel Douglas said, \"for a spy to slip over.\"\nHe sighed again. \"I fought in the scrap of 1917 as a kid of twenty; it\nwas different then. But this is 1938, and it's a scientific war we're\ntrying to fight.\" He sat down in his swivel chair. \"How--how did they\nwipe you out to-day?\"\n\n\"That blasted disintegrating flame again,\" Lance told him swiftly.\n\"It's obvious, Colonel: how did the Slavs know we were going to raid\nthat comparatively unimportant base of theirs at such and such a time?\nThey had the flame shooters all ready for us--and at a place where\nthey've never had them before! We came up at twenty-five thousand\nfeet, dropped down in a full power dive, and\"--he gestured\nwidely--\"biff! The flames caught us neatly at the regulation thousand\nfeet. They got thirteen men. Only two got away, Praed and myself.\"\nHis keen eyes were inquiring, and the colonel interpreted their look\ncorrectly.\n\n\"Praed,\" he murmured. \"Yes, I saw him come back, by himself. He said\nyou were following. Two of his motors were shot. He seems to bear a\ncharmed life, doesn't he?\"\n\nLance nodded. He didn't like to hint at the thought he had in mind. It\nseemed a cowardly, stab-in-the-back thing to do. Yet it was duty, and\nthere was no questioning duty.\n\n\"I've never seen Praed shoot down an enemy plane,\" he said slowly.\n\"This is the fifth time we've been ambushed--and Praed's never been\ncaught. Somehow, he's always seemed to be aware of what was coming.\"\n\n\"You mean--?\" the colonel questioned.\n\nLance shook his head. \"I don't want to commit myself, Colonel Douglas,\nbut--I'm suggesting that we--well--keep our eyes peeled, and perhaps\nwatch certain members of the outfit more closely.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDouglas rose as his orderly, Ranth, came into the room. \"Find\nLieutenant Praed for me,\" the colonel ordered crisply. Then, turning\nto Lance, he said: \"You'd better knock off a few hours' sleep. You are\nworn out.\"\n\nLance watched the orderly, Ranth, salute and leave. Ranth was heavy,\nthick-built, with closely set eyes. The young squadron leader was\nsuddenly conscious that he was, as the colonel said, worn out; his\nlimbs seemed leaden, his eyelids heavy. \"I think you're right, sir,\"\nhe murmured, and walked out onto the field.\n\nSeeing Praed's machine drawn up with the overall-clad figure of a\nmechanic fussing at its motors, he wandered over to survey it. The\nscout was an exact replica of his, a model of the famous Goshawk type.\nIt was all motor--everything being sacrificed to speed. On either side\nof the stubby brow of the fuselage, which held the death-dealing\nbattery of three machine-guns, were set the four Rahl-Diesel motors,\nback to back. The pilot's tiny enclosed cockpit was thus surrounded by\nengines. In the V-shaped, smooth-lined wings were the two helicopter\nprops; further back, inside the steel-sheathed, bullet-like fuselage,\nthe radio outfit and fuel tanks. The craft's rounded belly covered the\ngas bomb compartment.\n\nThe mechanic was a little cockney Englishman, a fugitive, like all his\ncountrymen, from the horror which had stricken England suddenly and\nleft her wallowing in her life blood. He looked up at Lance, and a\nsmile broke forth on his wizened, sharp little face.\n\n\"It's got me beat, sir,\" he said in his curious, twanging voice.\n\"Lieutenant Praed, 'e sez to me, 'Somethin' wrong with two of me\nmotors,' 'e sez. 'They quit on me quite sudden like. Look 'em over,\nwill you?' 'e sez. So I been lookin' 'em over. But they ain't nothin'\nwrong with the bloody things, sir--nothin' at all!\"\n\n\"It does seem funny, doesn't it, Wells?\" Lance said levelly. He'd\nknown it all along. Praed was a quitter--a yellow-belly--besides\nbeing--But he stopped there. He had no definite proof. It was unjust\nto accuse a man of _that_ without definite, positive proof.\n\nThe little mechanic muttered some mysterious cockney curse, and then\nsaid, in an admiring tone:\n\n\"'Ow many of the swines' planes 'ave you shot down now, sir?\"\n\n\"About twenty, I think,\" Lance told him gruffly. The cockney shot his\nbreath out with a whistle.\n\n\"Cripes! You'll be up to that there Captain Hay soon if you keeps it\nup, sir!\"\n\nLance laughed. Hay, the almost legendary hero of the American Air\nForce--who had shot down, so latest rumors said, fifty Slav\nplanes--was far above him. \"I'll never reach Hay's record, Wells. I'll\nbe doing pretty well if I bag half as many!\" Then, seeing Ranth, the\norderly, followed by Praed, he strode quickly away and came face to\nface with the latter.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a moment the two men eyed each other, a taut silence between them.\nPraed's thin, sun-blackened countenance was immovable, masklike. His\nblue-green eyes met Lance's steadily. Finally Lance snorted and burst\nout:\n\n\"Why the hell did you run away, Praed? Scared stiff?\"\n\nPraed's low voice, devoid of all trace of emotion, asked: \"What makes\nyou think I was scared, Lance?\"\n\n\"You know damn well what makes me think it! That lousy crack about\nyour motors being shot!\"\n\n\"Two of my motors were limping.\"\n\nLance gave a sarcastic chuckle. \"Ask Wells about that, why don't you?\nHe's got a few ideas on the subject.\"\n\nPraed repeated: \"Two of my motors were limping,\" and abruptly he\nturned away, leaving Lance fuming, and went into Colonel Douglas'\noffice.\n\nWhat would Douglas say to him? Accuse him outright of his suspicions?\nPut him under arrest as a spy? But he couldn't do that: there was,\nafter all, no proof. Lance swore to himself; then, feeling a wave of\nweariness surge over him, went to the shack he was quartered in,\nkicked off his battered boots, stripped away his Sam Browne, and flung\nhis lean body out on the hard, gray-sheeted cot. Seconds later he was\nlost in the sleep that comes to the physically exhausted. The\ndesperate situation America was in, the whole savage war--everything,\nfaded from his mind.\n\nBut to right and left of that cot stretched others--empty. The brave\nsquadron Lance had led into the blue sky that morning now lay charred\nskeletons around the flame-throwers that had struck them down.\n\nAnd in a dozen other aircraft bases behind the hard pressed lines were\nother empty cots. Time and time again the Slav planes shot down two to\nthe Americans' one; time and time again the treacherous\ndisintegrating flames--the weapon which baffled America's\nscientists--had struck down whole squadrons that had been lured into\ntraps, even as Lance's had been lured.\n\nAnd even the Slav forces pushed forward....\n\n\nPART II\n\n\"You're wanted by Colonel Douglas, sir.\"\n\nLance felt a hand jarring his shoulder; he turned sleepily over,\nyawned, and stared up into the dark, full-cheeked face of Ranth, the\norderly.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"Colonel Douglas wants you,\" repeated Ranth. \"It's five o'clock, sir.\"\n\nWearily Lance pulled on his boots and adjusted the military belt. The\nnight was hot and sticky; somewhere, miles to the rear of the base,\nthe batteries of long-distance guns were beginning their nightly\nserenade. Lance followed the orderly's broad, chunky back to the\ncolonel's office.\n\nThe colonel gazed up with tired eyes from the welter of maps on his\ndesk.\n\n\"Lance,\" he said, \"I'm changing the routine of the night patrol. A\nfresh batch of youngsters came in this afternoon to fill the empty\nfiles; two dozen new planes arrived by transport, too. I'm sending ten\nof them over for the night patrol; Stephens will take your place. I've\ngot another errand for you--and Praed.\"\n\nLance was conscious that Ranth was standing quietly behind the\ncolonel's chair. Douglas ordered him to attend to some errand and the\norderly left.\n\n\"I had an interview with Praed,\" the colonel went on. \"I didn't\nexactly accuse him of anything definite, but I think I threw a bit of\na scare into him. To-night we'll give him the acid test.\n\n\"You and he will fly over to-night to investigate Hill 333. There have\nbeen rumors that the Slavs are massing there, and we want positive\ninformation. There's sure to be a fight. Watch Praed carefully. If he\nsteers clear of any scrapping, well have enough to court-martial him\non. Understand?\"\n\nLance nodded.\n\n\"Right. It's a dangerous errand, Lance, but I'm confident you'll come\nthrough, as always. There's no one else who could handle the job. God,\nman, you're getting close to Hay's record! You'll be the top-notcher\nof the service soon!\"\n\nThe young man laughed briefly. \"No danger of that. When do we take\noff, sir?\"\n\nDouglas consulted his watch. \"Seven-fifteen. Come and get the dope\nfrom these maps. Hill 333's rather difficult to find.\"\n\n\"Anything been happening at the front, sir?\"\n\nThe colonel passed both fine-fingered hands over his lined face. He\nsaid quietly: \"Yes. The Slavs took twenty-five miles from us down in\nthe lower sector. Just wiped our boys out. Those damnable\nflame-throwers and bullet-proof tanks, supported by God knows how many\nhundreds of planes. It's hell, Lance! Headquarters thinks they're\ngoing to unleash a general attack all along the line in the next few\ndays. And our resources--well, our back's against the wall. We're\ncoming to death grips, man.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSeven-fifteen....\n\nLance pressed the starting button. His four motors choked, sputtered,\nthen burst into a sweet, full-throated roar. He glanced over at\nPraed's plane, spun the small helicopter props over and pushed down\nthe accelerator. The plane quivered, stuck its snout up and leaped\nlike an arrow into the clean, darkening air. Lance gunned it to ten\nthousand feet, Praed following him neatly. Praed was a good pilot, no\ndoubt about that. The two fighting machines hung for a second side by\nside; Lance eased off his helicopters and streaked away into the gloom\nat a breath-taking five hundred.\n\n\"I hope,\" muttered Colonel Douglas as the two tiny scouts sped from\nsight, \"that everything goes smoothly. They're the men to do it,\nanyway. No better pilots in the whole service.\"\n\n\"Wot abaht that there Captain Hay, sir?\" put in Wells, the mechanic,\nstanding nearby. Colonel Douglas smiled.\n\n\"Oh, of course!\" he amended. \"I'd forgotten Hay!\"\n\nOnce more they were anticipated! Lance, at thirty thousand feet--the\nRahl-Diesels, with their perfected superchargers, were easily capable\nof a ceiling of sixty--had hovered above the position of Hill 333,\npulled on his gas-mask and said through the microphone to Praed:\n\n\"Power dive to three thousand feet. Release your flares and take in\nall you can before they send up planes. We'll take 'em by surprise,\nbut there's bound to be a fight. Got it?\"\n\nThe steady reply came back: \"Okay.\"\n\nWhereat Lance set his teeth in his customary fighting grin, jockied up\nhis ammunition belts, glanced at the flare-parachutes folded alongside\nthe cabin and plunged the scout in a dive that tipped six hundred and\nfifty miles and threatened to crack the speed dial.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut surprise? Nothing doing! Like angry hornets five Slav planes\npounced on them at ten thousand feet. They'd been waiting there! Lance\ncursed savagely. He flung off his flares, Immelmanned up, and in less\nthan two seconds had sent one Slav shrieking to the ground in flames.\nFor the moment forgetting Praed, Lance followed after his flares,\nthree Slavs attempting to sight their guns on the twisting, writhing,\ncorkscrewing body of his Goshawk. He knew there were disintegrating\nflame-throwers below, but gambled on their not shooting because of the\nenemy scouts diving with him.\n\nFlattening out at perhaps a thousand feet, Lance threw a rapid stare\nat the bulk of Hill 333. He drew his breath in sharply.\n\nLit dazzlingly by the bleaching white of the slow-floating flares,\nhuge rows of the dreaded Slav tanks were clustered all around the\nhill!\n\nAs he looked, ten more Slav planes came soaring up from the ground.\nThis was too hot! The thought of Praed stabbed through Lance's\nwhirling brain; he pulled the scout around, doubled over the three\nclosing in on his tail, and belched lead for an instant at one he'd\ncaught off guard. It collapsed like a punctured paper bag. Lance\ngrinned and bounded to the upper regions. The two other Slavs let the\ncrazy Yank go for the instant, joining forces with the ten brothers\ncoming to help them out.\n\nLance, again at ten thousand, looked for Praed. Far above, he glimpsed\ntwo planes, circling and diving. Praed seemed to be fighting, at any\nrate! As he watched, the two scouts catapulted still higher; became\ntiny, almost imperceptible dots, visible only in the reflected light\nof the flares. Then Lance felt a shaft of ice along his spine.\n\nThe two planes had practically hugged each other for a second. Then\none of them fell away, somersaulted, tumbled down wildly--out of\ncontrol.\n\nIt passed Lance like a falling rock.\n\nAnd it was Praed's scout!\n\n\"My God!\" muttered Lance. \"He's been shot down!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next moment the twelve Slavs were on him like a hurricane. Motors\nroaring, Lance stood them off--flinging a burst of lead here, dropping\nout of range here, looping, catapulting, zooming--fazing them with\nevery trick he knew. A dozen times he sensed the zinging wrath of\nstorms of bullets, a dozen times he escaped death by the breadth of a\nhair. Not for nothing was he called one of the best pilots in the\nservice, second only to Hay.\n\nHe bagged another of the Slavs, and began to think of getting away.\nPraed had proved himself, but had been killed in doing so. He's got\nthe dope on Hill 333. Now for the getaway.\n\nAs he whirled, another Slav plane--the one that had got Praed--dove\ndown from above. And, in the last second of the ghostly light of the\nflares, Lance's bewildered eyes saw the face of the man inside it.\n\n_That face was Praed's!_\n\nPraed, inside an enemy scout! Praed firing at him! Praed, not dead!\n\nLance was dumbfounded. He almost died, just then, for he felt his\nsenses stagger, and relaxed his maneuvering. Praed! What--how--He\ncouldn't begin to reckon it out.\n\nIf the flares hadn't died at that instant, Lance must have been shot\ndown. Luckily, they expired; pitch darkness washed over everything.\nThe lights on the Slav planes switched on, their prying beams\nfingering the sky for Lance's plane. But Lance was somewhat himself\nagain. He jammed the accelerator down, dove headlong, flattened out\nand streaked for home. The speed of the Goshawk snatched him\nfaithfully from the jaws of the Slavs. He left then milling behind.\nLeft Praed with them!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nColonel Douglas was waiting for him. Lance's face must have been a\nstudy, for the elder man laughed shortly. \"You need a drink!\" he\ndecided, and poured out a stiff tot of rum. Lance downed it with a\nnervous gulp and sprawled in a chair, the glass held weakly in\nquivering fingers.\n\nDead silence brooded over the whole base. Even the muttering guns were\nstill. One green-shaded light threw the maps on Douglas' desk into\nglaring prominence; besides that, there was no illumination anywhere\nin the 'drome. Lance knew he had a thumping headache and that his eyes\nwere lumps of pain. The glass fell from his hand and crashed on the\nfloor. It seemed to stir the young captain, for at last he looked up\nand met the colonel's inquiring gaze.\n\n\"Well?\" The colonel was terse.\n\n\"I saw Praed shot down,\" Lance mumbled, as if to himself, \"and then I\nsaw him--\"\n\n\"Wait!\" Douglas strode rapidly to the door which led to the other\nrooms of the building. After glancing to right and left, with an\nexplanatory \"Walls sometimes have ears, you know!\" he locked the door\ncarefully again, came back, and said:\n\n\"Talk in a whisper! How about Hill 333?\"\n\n\"Tanks massed there,\" Lance said slowly. \"Yeh, I saw that, all right.\nThey must be intending an attack on that sector. But--but--Praed--\"\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\nLance told him of the scrap, how Praed's plane had apparently rubbed\nwings with a Slav and then tumbled down, out of control. He concluded:\n\"I figured that Praed was all right, that he'd proved himself, that he\nwasn't a spy, as we'd thought. _But the next moment I saw him in the\nSlav plane that had bagged his!\"_\n\nHis wondering eyes sought the colonel's lean face. Lance expected to\nsee it express amazement, incredulity. It didn't, though. He laughed!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhile Lance gaped, the older man went to the delicate machinery of the\nradiophone in one corner of the trim office. He clasped the earphones\nover his head, and spoke into the mike: \"Headquarters, Air Force,\nWashington, Douglas, Base 5, speaking.\"\n\nA tense moment passed while his radio call was put through. Presently\na green light flashed on the board. Douglas said swiftly:\n\"Headquarters? Base 5, Colonel Douglas. Tanks massed around Hill 333;\nenemy evidently contemplates full attack on corresponding sector of\nour line. They know a scout of ours observed it, however; perhaps that\nwill induce them to change their plans. This next is extremely\nimportant: _The first step of the Torpedo Plan has been successful!\"_\n\nFor awhile he listened intently, replying with short-clipped\naffirmatives. Then he hung the headphones up and turned to the\nbewildered Lance. Colonel Douglas laughed again and rubbed his hands\nexultantly.\n\n\"What the hell--\" Lance began. The other pulled out a drawer of his\ndesk and took from it a small placard.\n\n\"Do you recognize the photo?\" he asked smilingly.\n\nLance looked at it. It was the picture of a man in the uniform of a\ncaptain of the Air Force, a row of battle ribbons on his straight,\nkhaki-clad chest. But it was the figure's face that Lance stared at.\n\n\"Sure,\" he said finally. \"It's a picture of Praed. But what--\"\n\n\"Not Praed,\" corrected the colonel. \"Not Praed. Captain Basil Hay.\"\n\n\nPART III\n\n\"Good Lord!\" Lance exclaimed without knowing he did so. Praed--Hay!\nThe same man! Then that was the secret; that explained things! Hay,\nthe hero of the force!\n\n\"You're entitled to a few explanations,\" Douglas said. \"I'll give you\nthe core of the whole scheme. There's no need to tell you that it must\nbe guarded with your life.\" He drew his chair closer to Lance's.\n\n\"Yes, it's true. The man you knew as Praed in reality is Captain Hay.\nYou see, Lance, headquarters was taking no chances with what I just\ncalled the Torpedo Plan. Every move had to be conducted with the\nutmost secrecy. Had to be! For the Torpedo Plan is, in some ways,\nAmerica's last hope.\n\n\"Our base, No. 5, was chosen as the center of activity, the base from\nwhich the steps paving the way for the plan would be taken. The two\nbest pilots in the service were needed. You and Hay were chosen.\n\n\"It was decided it would be best to mask Hay's real identity. So,\nofficially, he was sent to the hospital; in reality he came here,\nunder the name of Praed. Why? Because there's a spy somewhere--we\ndon't seem to be able to track him; he's infernally clever--and if the\nfamous Captain Hay was switched to Base 5, putting the two best\npilots in the service together, that spy'd know something was in the\nair. Understand?\"\n\nLance nodded dumbly. A great light was beginning to shower him.\n\n\"To more completely mask our true purpose,\" the colonel continued,\n\"Hay was instructed to make it appear as if he were a spy. And it was\na damned hard job! The real spy, whoever he is, and wherever he is,\nwould thus be additionally fooled; for all he'd know, the Slavs might\nhave sent another over to back him up. That's why Hay never shot down\nan enemy plane. Says something about his skill as a pilot, doesn't it?\nNever able to defend himself, save by maneuvering. He's a great\nflyer!\"\n\nLance could only nod dumbly again.\n\n\"After a couple of weeks at this base,\" Douglas went on, \"Hay was to\ncross the lines one night with you accompanying him. You,\nunintentionally, would thus occupy the enemy planes while Hay attended\nto the real business of the evening. And you did splendidly!\"\n\n\"The real business?\" Lance questioned. \"What the devil was that? I\nthought the real business was to get the dope on Hill 333.\"\n\n\"So it was--partially. But also to take the first step of the Torpedo\nPlan, which was for Hay to switch over to a Slav plane.\"\n\n_\"What?\"_\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe colonel repeated his statement, somewhat dryly. Lance's square jaw\ndropped abruptly. \"But--but--\" he exclaimed, \"how the devil could he\ndo that?\"\n\nColonel Douglas grinned.\n\n\"By a very neat contraption from the brain of one of our most valuable\nscientists,\" he explained. \"Hay's scout was specially fitted up before\nyou left; while you were sleeping, in fact. Two experts from\nWashington arrived with that batch of new recruits this afternoon. A\ntiny sliding door was cut in the fuselage of the scout and a sort of\nfolding ladder put inside. It was motivated by some rather complex\nspring-work; but the really ingenious thing about it was the powerful\nelectro-magnet at its base.\n\n\"It's rather over my head,\" he smiled. \"I'm a plain fighting man, and\nsometimes it seems that scientists and not fighting men are going to\nwin this war.... But, at any rate, it worked like this:\n\n\"Hay lures, or maneuvers, a Slav plane away from its fellows, and\nwhile you're down below entertaining the others, flies wing to wing\nwith it. He touches the spring of his ladder and it shoots out,\npowerfully magnetized, and clamps onto the steel fuselage of the Slav.\nThe automatic control keeps Hay's scout steady, and the ladder is so\nhighly attractive that the Slav simply can't get away. Hay crosses the\ngulf, taking with him the cord which controls the electro-magnet. He\nforces his way into the Slav, shoots down its pilot, releases the pull\nof the magnet, and--there you are! Our best pilot in possession of a\nSlav plane, and clad in a Slav officer's uniform! Do you get the idea\nnow?\"\n\nLance strove for appropriate words. \"Gee!\" he spluttered. \"It's--it's\nwonderful! And to think I tried to start a fight with Hay! I wish I'd\nknown before. But I suppose,\" he added, \"it was best to let not even\nme in on it, to keep it absolutely secret.\"\n\n\"Exactly!\"\n\n\"And now what's Hay's mission?\" Lance asked eagerly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nColonel Douglas' face became sober. \"A damnably dangerous one, and a\nmighty desperate one. As I said, the Torpedo Plan, which Hay is\nstriving to carry out, seems to be America's last chance. We're\nholding the United Slavs, but only just. We simply can't break their\nline or make any headway against them; and when they do unleash their\nbig push, there's nothing to stop them! So we're gambling everything\non this slim hope.\n\n\"American science,\" he continued, \"has perfected a weapon which is\ncalled the 'flying torpedo.' It's a ghastly thing, too. Damn it, I\nactually feel sorry for the poor devils it bursts on! It's a sort of\nriposte to their disintegrating flame.\n\n\"Picture a huge tanklike affair of steel, one hundred feet long.\nPicture a few dozen of them! Picture them crammed to overflowing with\ntons of glyco-scarzite, the most destructive explosive the mind of man\nhas yet conceived. An explosive that can't be hurled in a shell and\ncan't be dropped in a bomb from a plane. A pound or so of it, man,\nlays waste a square mile of anything! Even our scientists are a bit\nafraid of it. They've been trying to think up a way of unleashing it\nat the Slavs. And these flying torpedoes seem to be the answer.\n\n\"The torpedoes are purely mechanical. Therefore, they can soar to any\nheight whatsoever. Twenty, thirty, even forty miles. All right. Now,\npicture a dozen or so of these torpedoes soaring over the most\nimportant Slav bases and headquarters, thirty miles above the earth,\nat night, of course, and absolutely invisible to the most powerful\nsearch-rays. They fly without the slightest sounds. Get that? Well,\nwhen this squadron of awful death arrives at the exact point over the\nplace to be demolished, the motive force switches off and down they\ncrash. Imagine what will happen when they collide with the ground!\"\nDouglas, with Lance's tense eyes on him, struck a clenched fist into\nan open palm.\n\n\"Tons of glyco-scarzite, Lance! Unleashed, without warning, from miles\nabove! Thirty of these torpedoes, each a hundred feet long, dropping\ndown on the very heart of the Slav invasion! Killing, blowing to bits,\nrather, every living thing, every fortification, every tree, every\ntank, every gun, every flame thrower, every plane in a radius of\nhundreds of miles!\"\n\n\"God!\" came from Lance's numb lips. \"God!\"\n\n\"_But_\"--and the colonel held up a straight forefinger--\"these\ntorpedoes must be guided from the place they raid!\"\n\nInto the silence Lance whispered: \"And that--that is Hay's job?\"\n\n\"That,\" Douglas confirmed levelly, \"is Hay's job--and yours.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTheir eyes met; held. And then Lance's clean young face smiled.\n\n\"Thank God, sir,\" he cried, \"that I'm to help strike the blow that'll\nfree our country!\"\n\nColonel Douglas answered his smile with a smile. \"Lance,\" he said,\n\"it's because Washington has put this job into Hay's and your hands\nthat I know--_I know_--it will succeed.\"\n\n\"It will!\"\n\nDouglas lowered his voice again. \"This is why those flying torpedoes\nmust be guided from the Slav's innermost base.\n\n\"In the first place, they fly too high for an accompanying plane to\nguide them. In the second, the power that releases them to hurtle\ndownwards must come from the enemy base itself, to permit of no\npossible error. This must not fail!\"\n\n\"But,\" put in Lance, \"how do the torpedoes fly? What motivates them?\"\n\n\"A closely guarded secret, of course,\" he was told. \"I merely possess\na slight comprehension of it. I know that it is an adaptation of that\ndiscovery of Professor Singe, two years ago--cosmic attraction.\nEventually, perhaps, it will permit interplanetary travel. This use of\nit is simply the beginning. But it is to America's everlasting glory\nthat a scientist of hers developed it.\n\n\"You know how a sliver of wood is propelled by the ripples of a pond?\nVibrations of the water, really. Well, evidently there are somewhat\nsimilar vibrations in the ether, cosmic force. Each one of these\nflying torpedoes contains a highly expensive, intricate mechanism\nwhich transforms this invisible vibration-power into material\npropulsion. The mechanism is adjusted to propel the torpedo at such an\naltitude in such a direction. We possess no means of setting the\nmachines to _stop_ at a certain place and so tumble earthwards. That's\nwhere you and Hay come in.\n\n\"Hay is now, with forged documents, passing himself off as a regular\nSlav pilot. He speaks the tongue. Two nights from now, you, Lance,\nkeep a rendezvous with Hay at an isolated ranch in the Lake Tahoe\ncountry--the Sola Ranch, where we staged that big fight a few months\nback.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLance nodded.\n\n\"In your plane is an instrument which is the kernel of the scheme. It\narrives here to-morrow. It's a device which shoots an invisible beam\nfifty miles into the air, a negative beam, in sympathy with the\nmachinery on the torpedoes. Hay sets this device near the Slav\nheadquarters. The torpedo squadron takes off from a few hundred miles\nbehind here, flying in the direction of the heart of the Slav forces.\nWhen they run into the beam, their motive power is nullified, and down\nthey fall. Crash! The Slavs are wiped out. Our troops charge forward\nin a grand attack; the Slavs, with no armament, no reinforcing troops,\nno supply of tanks and flame throwers, crumple. The invasion of\nAmerica is put to an end!\"\n\nLance rose. His face was alight, his eyes burning with strong,\nunquenchable fire.\n\n\"It's great, sir, great! It can't fail! By God, if it takes every last\ndrop of my blood, I'll help Hay put this through!\"\n\nColonel Douglas extended his right hand and Lance's met it in a firm\nshake. In the thick silence they stood thus for some minutes. Then,\nwithout moving so much as a cheek muscle, the colonel whispered, his\neyes tense:\n\n\"_The door! Fling it open! I think someone's been listening!_\"\n\nLance switched his alarmed gaze to it. His muscles went taut. The next\nmoment he had leaped half across the room, jammed back the lock, and\nripped the door wide.\n\nAt the other end of the dim passageway he glimpsed a scurrying figure!\n\nLance sprang after it with a shout to Douglas. Tearing out his\nautomatic, he flung a burst of lead at the figure, but that instant it\nwheeled and sped from sight down another passage. And when Lance got\nthere, no one was in sight.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor awhile he probed around, desperately, but could find no sign of\nanything. The base slept. Sorely troubled, he returned to find the\ncolonel just coming back from an equally barren search:\n\n\"Don't think he heard much,\" said Douglas grimly. \"It must have been\nthat damned spy who's been getting information of our movements. I'll\nhave the guards redoubled to prevent him from getting anything\nthrough.\" He smiled at sight of Lance's anxious face. \"No need for too\nmuch worry, Lance! He couldn't have heard much--the walls are\nsound-proof and the door fairly tight. Now, you go and rip off some\nsleep! You need it! No more work for you till Wednesday night--you're\ntoo important!\"\n\nSleep! Lance only wished he could. But the thrill of what he'd just\nheard was too fresh, too new; the blood pumped surgingly through his\nveins; his brain whirled with the thought of the glorious enterprise\nhe and Hay were aiding so vitally.\n\nThen, too, the night was humid and sweaty. For a while Lance lay on\nhis cot, other sleeping figures to left and right of him, but his own\neyes simply would not stay closed. Finally, after perhaps an hour of\ntrying to doze off, he arose and, clad only in breeches and\nundershirt, wandered outside again with a cigarette glowing in his\nmouth.\n\nThe war might not have been, the night was so silent. Lance strolled\nlazily around the plane hangars, revelling in what little breeze there\nwas. He seemed to be the only living thing abroad in the night.\n\nThen, suddenly, he flung down his cigarette and ground the butt out\nquickly. For he saw he was not the only living thing abroad in the\nnight. Sliding rapidly away from the end hangar was a dark form!\n\nLance crouched instinctively and crept forward. Who was the other\nwanderer? Not a sentry: they paced a regular beat closer to Douglas'\noffice. Not another, who, like himself, could not sleep and had sought\nthe open. This figure was going somewhere! It had a definite object in\nmind!\n\nSheltering himself behind the hangars' bulk, Lance advanced as\nstealthily as he could. Coming to the end one, he peered round its\nblunt corner. Fifty yards ahead, crossing a stubbly stretch of open\nground, the mysterious prowler hurried onward.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe night was dark, the moon troubled by ragged bursts of listless,\nheavy clouds. Lance bent almost double and left the shelter of the\nblack hangar. Feeling his way carefully, he followed the other.\n\nWas this the unknown spy? The spy, going to transmit the news he had\noverheard?\n\nLance muttered a curse. He had no weapon with him; the spy, if he were\na spy, would certainly be armed. But that didn't matter; it was merely\nunfortunate. He must track the other down, at all cost.\n\nFor some minutes he crept on in this manner. The other kept hurrying\nforward. Lance noted a clump of brush far ahead; the figure was\nevidently making for this. And sure enough, as if acting directly on\nLance's thought, the dark form entered the patch of growth--and did\nnot come out on the other side.\n\nLance broke into a trot, eyes wary and alert for sign of his prey. At\nany second he might be greeted by a salvo of bullets, and every fiber\nof his lean body was taut.\n\nAs he approached the clump of brush he dropped to the ground, and came\nfinally to it on his belly. From a distance of about ten feet, he rose\nand charged.\n\nExpecting each moment to hear the spit of a revolver, he was more\nalarmed by what actually did greet him.\n\nNothing. The patch of brush was empty!\n\n\"Well I'll be damned!\" Lance murmured. \"Where did he get to?\"\n\nHe gazed around, bewildered. The growth of bush was about ten feet\nwide. On either side the flat Nevada plain stretched away--empty. No\nfigure was visible.\n\nLance was utterly baffled. The fellow had vanished as if by magic.\nFlown away into thin air!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe young captain stood quite still, listening, probing his puzzled\nbrain.\n\nThen, like a cat, he dropped to the ground again, and pressed an ear\nto it. For his ears had caught a tiny betraying hum.\n\nA hum! There was a machine of some type near him. He listened\nintently. The hum came from the ground on which he lay. There had to\nbe a trap-door.\n\nLance's fingers scrabbled around, and presently found what they looked\nfor.\n\nHe seized the ring which enabled one to pull the trap-door back, and\nwas just about to pull when he heard, from below, a voice speaking in\nRussian. It was, then, the spy!\n\nLance grasped the ring anew, and, exerting all his strength, hauled\nthe trap-door back.\n\nA narrow passageway was revealed, lit by a lamp. The hum burst with\ndoubled force on his ears. He plunged down, fists clenched, and half\ntumbled into a tiny room gouged from the soil.\n\nAt one end was a mass of machinery, and a microphone hung suspended\nbefore it. And speaking into the microphone was the heavy-set form of\na man in American uniform, his back to Lance. As the latter charged\ndown, he rose with an alarmed shout, and wheeled around.\n\n\"My God!\" breathed Lance.\n\nIt was Ranth, Colonel Douglas' orderly!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRanth!\n\nHis dark face flushed with fury, he came leaping from his seat. The\nwicked little revolver hung at his belt sprang out, but Lance's right\nfist shot forward, knocked Ranth's hand high and sent the gun\nclattering to the ground. Then, for a moment, they faced each other,\nthe hum of the radiophone droning an ominous accompaniment.\n\n\"You!\" Lance muttered. \"So you were the spy!\"\n\nRanth answered him with a choked oath and leaped forward again.\n\nThere were no niceties to that combat. It was a matter of life and\ndeath, and each knew it. Ranth would kill him, Lance knew, if he\npossibly could; and he, he had to kill or capture Ranth. Otherwise the\nnews of the Torpedo Plan would go through, Ranth would return to the\nbase, and the secret of the hidden radio never be known. Another would\nbe put in Lance's place; and when Hay kept his rendezvous at Sola\nRanch....\n\nHe had to win.\n\nNo effort was made at defense, for those first few furious minutes. A\nveritable fusillade of hurtling fists stormed through the air. They\neach gave and took equally. Then Ranth's heavy shoulders bunched;\ncunningly he feinted, then, whirling, swung a vicious right hand smash\nto Lance's chin.\n\nLance reeled, fell, seeing Ranth's hate-contorted visage dance queerly\nin the close air before him. The orderly clutched for his revolver,\nand Lance bounded up as if spring-impelled, nailed the other with two\nlightninglike jabs and unleashed all his strength in an uppercut\nwhich sprawled Ranth in a limp, quivering heap.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPanting, Lance surveyed him, then turned to get the gun. He felt the\nshock of thudding flesh in his legs, and fell again with Ranth\nscrambling on top of him. Steel-ribbed hands pounced on his throat,\ngouged savagely, while the man above grunted thick curses from his\nslavering mouth. Lance struggled fiercely; saw a curtain of black rush\ndown. Desperately he hooked a booted leg up, craned it over Ranth's\nback, tugged. The terrible fingers loosened. Lance shook them off,\nrolled the other over and leaped once more to his feet, right hand\nclenched and ready.\n\nRanth staggered up. The young man measured him, pivoted, and smashed\nhis beefy jaw with a clean swing that had every ounce of Lance's hard\nyoung body behind it.\n\nThe orderly shot back as if struck by a locomotive. He crashed into\nthe radiophone, splintered the delicate instruments and slumped, eyes\nglazed, to the ground.\n\nHe was out. Dead out.\n\nBut how much had he got through on the radiophone before being\nstopped?\n\nHad he told where the rendezvous, was to be? Told the time and place,\nand warned the Slavs to look for Hay?\n\nLance sighed, and was conscious that his left eye was rapidly closing,\nthat a lip was split and his whole body sore. He slung Ranth over his\nshoulders and trudged wearily back to the base.\n\nHe told his story to Colonel Douglas' amazed ears. Ranth, come back to\nlife, was slapped in handcuffs, and for some time the colonel put him\nthrough a stern inquisition.\n\nBut his lips were sealed. He would not divulge how much he had\nsucceeded in passing on to the Slavs.\n\n\"A brave man,\" Douglas observed grimly when Ranth was carried off to\nthe brig, \"but it's death for him, the same as it would be death for\nHay were he caught.\"\n\n\"I don't think he had a chance to get much across, sir,\" Lance said.\n\"I was right on him almost as soon as he got there. You won't let this\ncancel our rendezvous?\"\n\nDouglas' thin lips smiled narrowly. \"No. You'll be taking a greater\nchance, Lance, but we must gamble on how much the Slavs know. You're\ngame, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWednesday night came. Thunderstorms muttered to each other on the\nlowering horizons; gusts of fierce, wind-driven rain slanted down on\nthe dripping base; occasionally a crooked finger of lightning probed\nthe black sky and lit the whole sopping countryside with a searing,\nflashing glare.\n\nThe night patrol had taken off. A single plane, wet and gleaming under\nthe sobbing heavens, stood on the tarmac, two heavily coated figures\nbefore it. Presently three more figures, carrying some bulky black\nobject carefully between them, emerged from one of the buildings.\nTenderly they placed this object in the lone plane, which had been\nstripped of radio outfit and gas bomb compartment to provide room.\nThen the two original figures were left alone once more before the\nfighting machine. Far to the rear, the heavy American guns barked in\ntheir regular nightly bombardment.\n\n\"A good night for it,\" Colonel Douglas, scanning the sky, said, \"and\nalso a bad one. If only that damned lightning would stop!\"\n\nLance, pulling on thick gloves, did not reply. The colonel consulted\nhis watch.\n\n\"What time do you make it?\" he asked.\n\n\"Exactly eight,\" the other answered.\n\n\"Right. At eight-six, you leave. At nine, on the dot, you meet Hay at\nSola Ranch. At nine-ten, the torpedoes take off. At quarter to ten,\nthey arrive over their destination--San Francisco and the surrounding\nterritory. And quarter to ten, if things go correctly--which they\nmust!--is the minute that ends the Slavish invasion of America. At ten\nminutes to ten, five minutes after the torpedoes strike, our troops\ncharge forward in general attack. God be with you, Lance! The fate of\nAmerica is resting on your shoulders to-night, remember!\"\n\n\"I'm remembering.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nColonel Douglas looked at the young man's grim, set face, looked at\nhis lithe, clean-limbed figure and his steady black eyes which burned\nwith a purposeful fire. And the colonel smiled.\n\n\"We'll win!\" he said.\n\nAn orderly sped from his office, saluted, and rapped crisply:\n\n\"Order just received from Washington, sir, to proceed.\"\n\nLance clasped Douglas' hand, and leaped into the snug, enclosed\ncockpit. The four motors bellowed as the thin-sprayed oil cascaded to\nthem. The helicopter props spun around.\n\n\"Go to it, kid!\" cried Douglas. \"Spy or no spy, you're coming out on\ntop! And give Hay a last handshake for me!\"\n\nAnd he swung to the salute.\n\nLance extended his hand. Then he gave his ship the gun, and the tiny,\nstreamlined scout teetered, roared, and rose with a scream into the\ndripping darkness high above.\n\nThe Torpedo Plan had started.\n\n\nPART IV\n\nLance hung for a moment at one thousand feet. A crack of lightning lit\nthe base below for a second, and he perceived the colonel's straight\nfigure with hand outstretched. Lance grinned, and gunned to forty\nthousand--an easy flying height, with his superchargers pumping and\nair-rectifiers normalizing the enclosed pilot's seat.\n\n\"But what,\" he wondered, as he stopped the helicopters, \"did he mean\nby 'give a _last_ handshake'?\"\n\nHe was soon to find out.\n\nBehind him, in the fuselage, nestled the weird cluster of machinery\nwhich was the Singe beacon. It certainly did not look imposing--a mass\nof spidery tubes mazing round a bulky black box, which was, Lance\nguessed, some new type of generator. Out of the top of the device\nsprouted a funnel-like horn, from which, on the adjustment of the\nbeacon's control studs, shot the nullifying ray. Lance could not\nsuppress a shiver as he thought of the earth-shaking cataclysm that\nray would conjure from the infinitely high heavens.\n\nAt forty thousand feet he was above the storm clouds, whose pitchy,\nvapor-drenched blackness effectively blanked out all sign of the\nearth. He might have been flying in outer space. Keeping a careful eye\non his instruments, he set a course for Sola Ranch. He kept his speed\naround three hundred, wishing to meet Hay exactly at nine.\n\nBut--would Hay be there?\n\nHow much did the Slavs know? How much had Ranth got through before he\nstopped him?\n\nA frown creased his brow. It was best not to puzzle over that\nquestion. Best just to go ahead, and keep going.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt about three minutes to nine he set the plane's nose down through\nveils of clammy cloud. This was mountainous country, sparsely\npatrolled by Slav ships. Lance hovered cautiously over the firred\nmountain tops, getting his directions, shooting wary eyes through the\nmagnifying mirrors in search of enemy scouts. He saw none. Satisfied,\nhe cut the Rahl-Diesels, gunned the helicopter props and dropped\nlightly down on the stubbly field of Sola Ranch.\n\nTo left and right loomed the dim outlines of the lonely mountains.\nBefore the war, the owner of Sola Ranch had grown apples; this field\nhad housed a few horses. It made a perfect meeting place--secluded,\nmisty with the clinging mountain vapors, far apart from the war.\n\nLance felt like a prowling werewolf there, waiting for its ghostly\nmate.\n\nRain was still splattering in desultory bursts, but distance muted the\nrumbling salvos' of thunder. His watch told him it was one minute to\nnine.\n\nNow--what?\n\nHay, or a swooping squadron of Slav planes?\n\nLance stepped out of the cockpit into the rain, though holding himself\ntensely ready to leap back again and soar away. He stared around, and\npeered above.\n\nWas that a shadow?--a nightmare flying bird?--or a plane?\n\nHe grasped a hand-flash, and rapidly signalled his identity. The next\ninstant, it seemed, the shadow wavered, then fell earthward with great\nspeed.\n\nOut of the gloom and rain it came--an enemy plane.\n\nIt dropped down beside his scout. From its cockpit came a few swift\nflashes of light.\n\nHay!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLance ran eagerly over to the other plane, and out from its enclosed\ncabin stepped the man he had known as Praed.\n\nWordlessly, they gripped hands. Hay's thin, straight face wore a\nsmile, and he met Lance's eyes keenly. Lance stammered:\n\n\"S-sorry, Captain Hay, about--about the way I treated you at the base.\nYou see, I had no idea who you were.\"\n\nHay cut short his apologies with a laugh. \"Rot! I'd've been the same\nway myself.\" He glanced rapidly at Lance's plane. \"Got it?\" he\nquestioned. \"I'm a bit late; had a hell of a time getting here without\narousing suspicion. We'd best hurry.\"\n\nLance nodded. They hurried to the Goshawk. As they worked, carefully\nlifting out the Singe beacon, Lance, in crisp, short-clipped\nsentences, told his companion of Ranth, the spy.\n\n\"You don't know how much he got through?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Lance. \"No.\"\n\n\"Hm-m. Well, we'll have to trust to luck.\"\n\n\"You know the working of the beacon?\" Lance asked. On the other's nod\nof affirmation he continued: \"What's your plan?\"\n\n\"Light about five miles this side of Frisco itself, just near the main\nSlav military base. Anywhere in that territory would do, though. The\nbeacon doesn't go up in a narrow ray; it spreads, diffuses. The\nsquadron of torpedoes will cover some fifty or sixty miles of ground,\nI believe. They'll utterly demolish the city, and every damned Slav in\nit.\" His face, in the darkness, went grim and hard. \"And it'll damn\nwell pay them back,\" he rasped, \"for the horrible way they massacred\nSan Francisco's population....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Singe beacon was in his plane. Hay turned to Lance, stretching out\nhis hand for a farewell clasp. Then Lance asked the question that had\nbeen worrying him.\n\n\"Colonel Douglas told me to give you a last handshake for him. _Last._\nWhy did he say that?\"\n\n\"Because,\" Hay said smilingly, \"I'm staying by the beacon to make sure\nthat nothing goes wrong. I guess that's why he said it, old\nfellow....\"\n\nLance gasped: \"You're sacrificing your life?\"\n\n\"Of course. To save seventy-five million others.\"\n\nThen suddenly they both stared above.\n\nA roar of sound--of purring motors, of props, mixed with the chatter\nof a dozen machine-guns--had belched with numbing suddenness from the\nlow-hanging clouds.\n\nEnemy planes! A patrol of them!\n\n\"God!\" jerked Lance. \"Ranth's warning got through! Part of it,\nanyway!\"\n\nHe leaped for his plane, shouting: \"I'll hold 'em off! You get away\n_quick_!\" and, through a veritable hail of lead, sprang into the\ncockpit.\n\nThen, a cold pang at his heart, he sprang out again.\n\nA bullet had caught Hay!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a moment, the Slav fire ceased, while their planes zoomed up to\nstart another death-dealing dive. And in that moment Lance was at\nHay's side, where he had fallen.\n\n\"They--got me,\" whispered Hay, a stream of blood welling from his\ngasping mouth. \"I'm--I'm going. C-carry me to--to your plane. I've\nstill a--a little strength left. You take the beacon. I--I'll hold\nthem--as--as long as--I can. Put through that beacon, boy! _Put it\nthough!_\"\n\nHis brain a maelstrom, Lance stared at the crumpled figure. It was the\nonly way! He heard the motors above come roaring down again;\ndesperately he carried the blood-choking Hay to his own plane; propped\nhim limply at the controls. Bullets spat through a frenzy of noise.\nWeakly Hay started the Goshawk's Diesels, and weakly, into Lance's\nface, smiled, and beckoned him to leave.\n\nAnd, as Lance, a grim resolve at his heart, turned, Hay's\nblood-frothed lips formed the words: \"Carry on!\"\n\nThrough the raining lead, seeming to bear a charmed life, Lance leaped\nto Hay's plane, hearing as he did so his own, with a stricken pilot at\nits controls, hurtle upwards.\n\nCarry on! For the life of America!\n\nCarry on!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTen minutes past the hour of nine. A full thousand miles behind the\nlines, on the wide black field of America's major war base, a small\ngroup of men stood, surveying the awesome weapons assembled there.\n\nRow upon row of huge, dully-gleaming cigar-shaped things stretched\naway into the darkness before them. There were only one or two faint\nlights to give illumination, and the night choked in on them, making\nthem terrifying.\n\nThey resembled, more than anything else, half-sized dirigibles, being\nroughly about one hundred feet long and perhaps as much as thirty\nfeet high. At first sight, they seemed to be numberless; then, as the\nbewildered eye became more sane, one could count them and see that\nthere were, in reality, about thirty. Their prows were stubby; in the\nport side of each a tiny trap-door yawned, and standing by every\ntrap-door was the overall-clad figure of a mechanic, waiting for the\nsignal.\n\nThe Commander of the American Air Force looked up from his\nwrist-watch. At his side was a peculiar gnomelike figure, a figure\nwith hunched, twisted back and huge, over-heavy head. This was\nProfessor Singe, and from that ridiculous head had come the germ which\nhad finally expanded into the torpedoes arrayed before him.\n\nHis eyes were nervous; his crooked face twitched ceaselessly. \"Time?\"\nhe kept asking. \"Time? Is it yet time?\" And finally the tall figure of\nthe Commanding Officer turned and rapped: \"Time!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAn aide-de-camp raised a hand. As if working by some mechanical\ndevice, the figure which stood by each torpedo climbed through the\ntrap-doors, jumped out a second later, and came running to the head of\nthe field.\n\n\"About thirty seconds,\" muttered Singe nervously, eyes alight. \"Thirty\nseconds for their motors to catch the stream. Thirty--ah!\"\n\nFor the squadron of man-made horrors had stirred.\n\n\"God pity San Francisco!\" murmured the Commanding Officer, and stepped\nback involuntarily as the whole fleet lifted their glyco-scarzite\ncrammed bellies from the field and, as if moved by some magical,\nunseen, unheard force, shot up into the darkness with ever gathering\nspeed.\n\n\"God pity it, indeed!\" chuckled Singe exultantly. \"It'll need it!\"\n\nThe C. O. sighed and shook his head slowly. \"War!\" he mused. \"And yet,\nit's our only chance.\" For a moment he paused, seemingly unconscious\nof the macabre little form next to him, still gazing aloft at the now\ninvisible torpedoes, and then muttered:\n\n\"And God pity Basil Hay, who's giving his life to America--a glorious,\nunselfish hero. God pity Basil Hay!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAmerican flyers never knew of Basil Hay's last fight. Had they, it\nwould have become legendary.\n\nFor Hay fought a grim battle against two foes. One, he could face and\nconquer, as he had conquered often before. But the other lurked next\nto his dauntless heart, and it Hay could not subdue.\n\nIt was death.\n\nTruly, Hay's fight there in the wet clouds above Sola Ranch was an\ninspired one. He fought almost by instinct alone, instinct twenty\nyears of piloting had planted deep in his veins. He fought for\nLance--for America. His eyes, glazing rapidly, could not distinguish\nthe roaring phantoms that laced around his lone plane, but uncannily\nhis bursts of fire went home again and again, while theirs ripped\naimlessly over the Goshawk's hell-driven snout.\n\nOf course it could not last. Gallant spirit alone kept Basil Hay taut\nat his controls. Spirit alone thrust back the ever-increasing surge of\nblack oblivion that pounded at his heart and brain. Spirit alone sent\nthe pitifully outnumbered plane corkscrewing in peerless maneuverings\nthat baffled the on-passing Slavs and thrust four of them to the\nsodden ground in flame. Spirit that would not surrender--but had to.\n\nThey could never have conquered Basil Hay in a plane. An ambushing\nbullet that caught him off guard did that. And finally Hay fell.\n\nBut he had kept them for ten full minutes. Ten minutes--each one a\nlasting, mute testimony to his unquenchable, unyielding spirit.\n\nHe flung a last salvo from his hot machine-guns, then, heart numbing,\njerked back the control-stick and careened high. He slumped down. The\nplane paused, wallowed crazily for a moment, and then roared\nearthward, \"Carry on!\" formed faintly on its dead pilot's bloody lips.\n\nBasil Hay had fought his last fight.\n\nTen minutes....\n\nLance hadn't expected that long. He'd thought Hay would die in a few\nseconds. The man was mortally wounded; could not last.\n\nNevertheless, minutes or seconds, he was entrusted with the Singe\nbeacon, and it was his job and his will to put it through.\n\nHe'd climbed the Slav plane up to its ceiling, driven it till it\nsimply refused to go higher, and then roared on towards San Francisco.\nEach second he expected to see others come hurtling after him. When\nthey did not, he knew how really great Hay's will was. It was an\ninspiring example.\n\nBut his brain was tortured by a multitude of conflicting doubts. A\npatrol of Slav scouts had ambushed them. Just how much did the Slavs\nknow, then, about the torpedoes?\n\nHe, Lance, had to guide the Singe beacon. Quickly he reviewed what Hay\nhad told him.\n\n\"Light about five miles this side of Frisco. Anywhere in that\nterritory would do, though. The beacon doesn't go up in a narrow ray;\nit spreads, diffuses.\"\n\n_Spreads, diffuses._\n\nHay had been clad in Slav uniform, and thus could, with a certain\nmeasure of safety, put the beacon machinery on the ground itself. But\nLance was in American uniform; if he landed, he ran great risk of\nbeing noticed and attacked at once.\n\nLance saw immediately that there was only one way out. It was sure\ndeath, but Hay had expected death, and so must he.\n\nHis lips set in stern resolve. It meant good-by--farewell to the girl\nhe'd left behind, farewell to life, farewell to everything--but not\nfor a second did he debate the course he would take.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLance glanced at his watch. Nine-thirty. The torpedoes were even now\non their way, hurtling along miles above the earth. In fifteen minutes\nthey would be over San Francisco. In fifteen minutes the Singe beacon\nhad to meet them.\n\nHe was not familiar with the Slav plane's instruments, but he judged\nhe'd traveled some hundred and twenty-five miles; was nearing the\noutskirts of San Francisco. The air below would be thick, probably,\nwith enemy scouts, but his appearance should pass unchallenged as long\nas they didn't glimpse his betraying uniform.\n\nHe set the plane's nose down in a long slanting dive.\n\nWhipping through the clouds, the guarding search-rays of San Francisco\nwere soon visible. Lance saw a few patrols of enemy scouts; he clung\nto the clouds, decreased his speed, and began circling over the heart\nof the metropolis itself.\n\nTwenty to ten.\n\nOccasionally a Slav plane flashed by him. Thank God, they didn't\nchallenge! Lance went still lower. Finally, at a thousand feet, he set\nthe helicopter props in motion and hung in mid-air--directly above the\nvery center of the city.\n\nSixteen minutes to ten.\n\nNow!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the American front-line trenches, massed troops crouched\nexpectantly. Clustered on every air base were flights of planes, each\none crammed with bombs. Far behind, the Yank gun-crews edged nervously\nup to their mighty charges, and fingered anxiously the stubby gas\nshells which soon would be flung through the dripping night.\n\nAnd at Base No. 5 a very uneasy Colonel Douglas paced back and forth\nin his office, muttering: \"No news from Lance! No news from Lance!\nGod! He can't have failed! But why doesn't he show up?\"\n\nHe had not failed.\n\nHovering in the plane over San Francisco Lance squirmed round in his\nseat, reached back into the fuselage, and pressed rapidly the studs on\nthe Singe beacon. A high whining noise pierced instantly through the\nplane. And up stabbed the beacon, invisible, deadly--up, up, up to a\nthin realm miles above, where it flashed into an awesome squadron of\nterrible shells of steel!\n\nShells that, a second later, wavered, staggered, and plunged\nearthward!\n\nAnd Lance tensed in his seat. From above, he caught a tiny whistling\nnoise--a whistling that hurtled into a terrific shriek--that roared\never closer.\n\n\"Carry on!\" he muttered. \"Carry on!\"\n\nThe words froze on his lips, for the world was suddenly consumed, it\nseemed, by flame and splitting, bellowing thunder.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe American guns spoke.\n\nFrom every aerodrome long flights of scouts and bombers and transport\nplanes roared upward.\n\nIn the front trenches the troops, still somewhat dazed by the\nearth-shaking explosion that had just tumbled from the far horizon--a\nhorizon still lit by leaping tongues of awful flame--poured over the\ntop, gas-masks on, repeaters and portable machine-guns at the ready,\nwith a fierce cry on their lips.\n\nBefore that avenging attack the Slavs, their very spine broken,\nbewildered and confused, already turning in panic, could not stand.\n\nAmerica swept to the Pacific, and left death in her wake. And when she\ncame to San Francisco, not even the sternest fighting men, still hot\nfrom battle, could repress a shudder, so awful was the devastation.\n\nThe Slav invasion was over!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the rebuilt city of San Francisco there is a statue that stands\nproudly before the magnificent, gleaming city hall.\n\nIt represents two slim, straight-standing figures, clad in the uniform\nof the American Air Force. Their outstretched arms support a tiny\none-seater Goshawk fighting plane.\n\nBelow, as you know, there is a plaque. Men touch their hats as they\nwalk by it; flowers are always fresh at its base. On the plaque are\nthe words:\n\n                To The Everlasting\n                    Memory Of\n\n             Captain Basil Hay, A.A.F.\n             Captain Derek Lance, A.A.F.\n\n           Who, In The War Of 1938, Gave\n           Their Lives In Destroying And\n             Devastating San Francisco\n           That San Francisco And America\n                     Might Live\n\n\n[Illustration: Advertisement.]\n\n\n\n\nThe Tentacles From Below\n\nA COMPLETE NOVELETTE\n\n_By Anthony Gilmore_\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\"_Machine-Fish_\"\n\n[Illustration: _Bowman hooked it on the hawser arm above._]\n\n[Sidenote: Down to tremendous ocean depths goes Commander Keith Wells\nin his blind duel with the marauding \"machine-fish.\"]\n\n\n\"Full stop. Rest ready.\"\n\nThese words glowed in vivid red against the black background of the\n_NX-1's_ control order-board. A wheel was spun over, a lever pulled\nback, and in the hull of the submarine descended the peculiar silence\nfound only in mile-deep waters. Men rested at their posts, eyes alert.\n\nAbove, in the control room, Hemingway Bowman, youthful first officer,\nglanced at the teleview screen and swore softly.\n\n\"Keith,\" he said, \"between you and me, I'll be damned glad when this\nmonotonous job's over. I joined the Navy to see the world, but this\ncharting job's giving me entirely too many close-ups of the deadest\nparts of it!\"\n\nCommander Keith Wells. U. S. N., grinned broadly. \"Well,\" he remarked,\n\"in a few minutes we can call it a day--or night, rather--and then\nit's back to the _Falcon_ while the day shift 'sees the world.'\" He\nturned again to his dials as Hemmy Bowman, with a sigh, resumed work.\n\n\"Depth, six thousand feet. Visibility poor. Bottom eight thousand,\" he\nsaid into the phone hung before his lips, and fifty feet aft, in a\nsmall cubby, a blue-clad figure monotonously repeated the observations\nand noted them down in an official geographical survey report.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuch had been their routine for two tiring weeks, all part of the\n_NX-l's_ present work of re-charting the Newfoundland banks.\n\nAs early as 1929 slight cataclysms had begun to tear up the sea-floor\nof this region, and of late--1935--seismographs and cable companies\nhad reported titanic upheavals and sinkings of the ocean bed, changing\nhundreds of miles of underwater territory. Finally Washington decided\nto chart the alterations this series of sub-sea earthquakes had\nwrought.\n\nAnd for this job the _NX-1_ was detailed. A super-submarine fresh from\nthe yards, small, but modern to the last degree, she contained such\nexclusive features as a sheathing of the tough new glycosteel,\nautomatic air rectifiers, a location chart for showing positions of\nnearby submarines, the newly developed Edsel electric motors, and\nautomatic teleview screen. When below surface she was a sealed tube of\nmetal one hundred feet long, and possessed of an enormous cruising\nradius. From the flower of the Navy some thirty men were picked, and\nin company with the mother-ship _Falcon_ she put out to combine an\nexhaustive trial trip with the practical charting of the newly changed\nocean floor.\n\nNow this work was almost over. Keith Wells told himself that he, like\nBowman, would be glad to set foot on land again. This surveying was\nimportant, of course, but too dry for him--no action. He smiled at the\nlines of boredom on Hemmy's brow as the younger man stared gloomily\ninto the teleview screen.\n\nAnd then the smile left his lips. The radio operator, in a cubby\nadjoining the control room, had spoken into the communication tube:\n\n\"Urgent call for you, sir! From Captain Knapp!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWells reached out and clipped a pair of extension phones over his\nears. The deep voice of Robert Knapp, captain of the mother-ship\n_Falcon_, came ringing in. It was strained with an excitement unusual\nto him.\n\n\"Wells? Knapp speaking. Something damned funny's just happened near\nhere. You know the fishing fleet that was near us yesterday morning?\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Well, the whole thing's gone down! Destroyed, absolutely! The sea's\nbeen like glass, the weather perfect--yet from the wreckage, what\nthere is of it, you'd think a typhoon had struck! I can't begin to\nexplain it. No survivors, either, so far, though we're hunting for\nthem.\"\n\n\"You say the boats are completely destroyed?\"\n\n\"Smashed like driftwood. I tell you it's preposterous--and yet it's\nthe fact. I think you'd better return at once, old man; you're only\nhalf an hour off. And come on the surface; it's getting light now, and\nyou might pick up something. God knows what this means, Keith, but\nit's up to us to find out. It's--it's got me....\"\n\nHis tones were oddly disturbed--almost scared--and this from a man who\ndidn't know what fear was.\n\n\"But Bob,\" Keith asked, \"how did you--\"\n\n\"Stand by a minute! The lookout reports survivors!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWells turned to meet Bowman's inquisitive face. He quickly repeated\nthe gist of Knapp's weird story. \"We saw them at dusk, last\nevening--remember? And now they're gone, destroyed. What can have done\nit?\"\n\nFor some minutes the two surprised men speculated on the strange\noccurrence. Then Knapp's voice again rang in the headphones.\n\n\"Wells? My God, man, this is getting downright fantastic! We've just\ntaken two survivors on board; one's barely alive and the other crazy.\nI can't get an intelligible thing from him; he keeps shrieking about\nwrithing arms and awful eyes--and monsters he calls 'machine-fish'!\"\n\n\"You're sure he's insane?\"\n\nRobert Knapp's voice hesitated queerly.\n\n\"Well, he's shrieking about 'machine-fish'--fish with machines over\nthem!... I--I'm going to broadcast the whole story to the land\nstations. 'Machine-fish'! I don't know.... I don't know.... You'd\nbetter hurry back, Wells!\"\n\nHe rang off.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKeith slipped off the headphones and told Bowman what he had learned.\nHardy, staunchly built craft, those fishing boats were; born in the\nteeth of gales. What horror could have ripped them--all of them--to\ndriftwood, with the weather perfect? And a half-mad survivor, raving\nabout \"machine-fish\"!\n\n\"Such things are preposterous,\" Bowman commented scornfully.\n\n\"But--the fleet's gone, Hemmy,\" Keith replied. \"Anyway, we'll speed\nback, and see what it's all about.\"\n\nHe punched swift commands on the control studs. \"Empty Tanks, Zoom to\nSurface, Full Speed,\" the crimson words glared down below, and the\n_NX-1_ at once shoved her snout up, trembling as her great electric\nmotors began their pulsing whine. The delicate fingers of the massed\ndials before Keith danced exultantly. The depth-levels tolled out:\n\n\"Seven thousand ... six thousand ... five thousand--\"\n\n\"Keith! Look there!\"\n\nHemmy Bowman was pointing with amazement at the location chart, a\nblack mesh screen that showed the position of other submarines within\na radius of two miles. In one corner, a spot of vivid red was shining.\n\n\"But it can't be a submarine!\" Wells objected. \"Our reports would have\nmentioned it!\"\n\nThe two officers stared at each other.\n\n\"'Machine-fish!'\" Bowman whispered softly. \"If there were machines,\nthe metal would register on the chart.\"\n\n\"It must be them!\" the commander roared, coming out of his daze. \"And,\nby God, we're going after them!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRapidly he brought the _NX-1_ out of her zoom to the surface, and left\nher at four thousand feet, in perfect trim, while he read the\ninstruments closely.\n\nA green spot in the center of the location chart denoted the _NX-1's_\nexact position. A distance of perhaps forty inches separated it from\nthe red light on the meshed screen--which represented, roughly, a mile\nand a half. Below the chart was a thick dial, over which a black hand,\nindicating the mysterious submersible's approximate depth, was slowly\nmoving.\n\n\"He's sinking--whatever he is,\" Keith muttered to Hemmy. \"Hey, Sparks!\nGet me Captain Knapp.\"\n\nA moment later the connection was put through.\n\n\"Bob? This is Wells again. Bob, our location chart shows the presence\nof some strange undersea metallic body. It can't be a submarine, for\nmy maritime reports would show its presence. We think it has some\nconnection with the 'machine-fish' that survivor raved about. At any\nrate, I'm going after it. The world has a right to know what destroyed\nthat fishing fleet, and since the _NX-1_ is right on the spot it's my\nduty to track it down. Re-broadcast this news to land stations, will\nyou? I'll keep in touch with you.\"\n\nKnapp's voice came soberly back. \"I guess you're right, Keith; it's up\nto you.... So long, old man. Good luck!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn Wells' veins throbbed the lust for action. With control studs at\nhand, location chart and teleview screen before his eyes and fifteen\nmen waiting below for his commands, he had no fear of any monster the\nunderseas might spew up. He glanced swiftly at the location chart and\ndepth indicator again.\n\nThe mysterious red spot was slowly coming across the _NX-1's_ bows at\na distance of about one mile. Keith punched a stud, and, as his craft\nfilled her tank and slipped down further into deep water, he spoke to\nHemmy Bowman.\n\n\"Take control for a minute. Keep on all speed, and follow 'em like a\nbloodhound. I'm going below.\"\n\nHe strode down the connecting ramp to the lower deck, where he found\nfifteen men standing vigilantly at posts. At once Keith plunged into a\nfull explanation of what he had learned up in the control room. He\nconcluded:\n\n\"A great moral burden rests on us--every one of us--as we will soon\ncome face to face with a possible world menace. Anything may happen. A\nstate of war exists on this submarine. You will be prepared for any\nwartime eventuality!\"\n\nSobered faces greeted this announcement, and perceptibly the men\nstraightened and held themselves more alertly. Wells at once returned\nto the control room. A glance at the location chart and its two tiny\nlights told him that the intervening distance had been decreased to\nabout half a mile.\n\nThe depth dial showed them both to be two miles below, and steadily\ndiving lower. Charts showed the sea-floor to be three miles deep in\nthis position, and that meant--\n\n\"Look there!\" exclaimed the first officer suddenly. \"It's changing\ncourse!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe crimson stud had suddenly shifted its course, and now was fleeing\ndirectly before them. For a moment the distance between the green and\nred lights remained constant--and then Keith Wells stared\nunbelievingly at the chart, wiped a hand across his eyes and stared\nagain.\n\n\"Why--why, the devils are as fast as we!\" he exclaimed in amazement.\n\"I think they're even gaining on us!\"\n\n\"And there's no other submarine in the world that can do more than\nthirty under water!\" Hemmy Bowman added. \"We're hitting a full\nforty-one!\"\n\nA call came through the communication tube from Sparks. \"Report from\nConsolidated Radio News-Broadcasters, sir, aimed especially at us.\"\n\n\"Well?\" asked Keith, motioning Hemmy to listen in. Sparks read it.\n\n\"'A week ago Atlantic City reported that seven men were snatched off\nfishing boat by unidentified tentacled monsters. Testimony of\nwitnesses was discredited, but was later corroborated by the almost\nidentical testimony of other witnesses at Brighton Beach, England, who\nsaw man and woman taken by mysterious monsters whilst bathing.'\nPerhaps these same creatures destroyed the Newfoundland fishing\nfleet.\" His level voice ceased.\n\n\"Tentacled monsters ... 'machine-fish,'\" Wells murmured slowly.\n\"'Machine-fish.'...\"\n\nTheir eyes met, the same wonder in each. \"Well,\" Keith rapped at\nlast, \"we're seeing this through!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe turned again to the location chart. The green spot as always was in\nthe center, and at a constant distance was the red, showing that the\n_NX-1_ was hot on the other's trail. The depth dials indicated that\nboth were diving deeper every moment.\n\n\"Where in hell's it going?\" the commander rasped. \"We'll be on the\nfloor in a few minutes!\"\n\nHere the teleview showed the world to be one of fantasy, one to which\nthe sun did not exist. It was not an utter, pitchy blackness that\npervaded the water, but rather a peculiar, dark blueness. No fish\nschools, Keith noted, scurried from them. They had already left these\nwaters; aware, perhaps, of the passing Terror....\n\nThey plunged lower yet. Wells was conscious of Hemmy Bowman's quick,\nuneven breathing. Conscious of the tautness of his own nerves, strung\nlike quivering violin strings. Conscious of the terrific walls of\nwater pressing in on them. And conscious of the men below, their lives\nbound implicitly in his will and brain....\n\nA thought came to him, and quickly he reached into a rack for the\nchart of the local sea-floor. His brow creased with puzzlement as he\nstudied it.\n\n\"Here's more mystery, Hemmy,\" he muttered. \"Look--there's an\nunderwater cliff about half a mile dead ahead. It rises to within four\nthousand feet of the surface. And that thing out there is charging\nstraight into its base!\"\n\n\"They must be aware of it,\" jerked the other. \"See?--they've stopped!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was true. The gulf between the two colored spots was rapidly being\nswallowed up. At a pulsing forty-one knots the _NX-1_ was closing in\non the motionless mystery craft.\n\n\"They're sinking to the floor itself,\" observed Wells. \"Perhaps\nwaiting to attack.\"\n\nThe invisible beams from their ultra-violet light-beacons streamed\nthrough the silent gloom outside, yet still the teleview screen was\nempty. Keith punched a stud, and the _NX-1's_ whining motors dulled to\na scarcely audible purr.\n\n\"What is the thing?\" muttered Hemmy Bowman. \"God, Keith, what _is_\nit?\"\n\nFor answer, the commander dropped them the last five hundred feet. The\nsea-floor rose like a gray ghost. More control studs were pushed; the\norder-board below read: \"All Power Off, Rest in Trim.\" The location\nchart told a tale that wrung a gasp from Bowman's throat. The red and\ngreen lights were practically touching....\n\nThe hands of Petty Officer Brown, the helmsman, were quivering on the\nhelm. Wells' fists kept tensing and relaxing as he peered for a sight\nof the enemy in the teleview. Nothing showed but the moving fingers of\nspectral kelp. Then both he and Bowman cried out as one:\n\n\"_There!_\"\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n_The Silent Ray_\n\nA strange shape had suddenly materialized on the screen--an immense,\noval-shaped thing of dull metal, with great curving cuts of glass-like\nsubstance in its blunt bow, like staring eyes; a lifeless, staring\nthing, stretching far into the curtain of gloom behind. How long it\nwas, Keith could not tell; at first his numb brain refused to grasp it\nand reduce it to definite, sane standards of size and length. The cold\nweeds of the sea-floor kelp beds swayed eerily over and around it.\nFrom its bow, he saw, peculiar knobs jutted, the function of which he\nguessed with dread.\n\nWas it waiting with a purpose? Was it waiting--and inviting attack?\n\nA frightened whisper from Hemmy Bowman broke the hush:\n\n\"Keith, the thing has ports, but shows no lights! What kind of\ncreatures can they be?\"\n\nAs he spoke, the three men in the control room felt the unmistakable,\njarring tingle of an electric shock. And while their nerves still\njumped, it came again; and again. They were conscious of a slight\nfeeling of drowsiness.\n\nKeith gaped at Bowman and Brown, and then a flash on the teleview\nscreen drew his eyes. There, against the blackness of its otherwise\ninanimate hulk, one of the jutting knobs on the bow of the mysterious\nsubmarine was glowing and pulsing with orange life! With it came the\ntingling shock again. It flicked off as they watched, then returned\nand went once more.\n\n\"They're attacking, but thank God the shock was harmless!\" Wells said\ngrimly. \"All right; they've asked for it: I'm going to see how they\nlike the taste of a torpedo!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe two submarines were resting on the ocean floor with perhaps two\nhundred feet between them. The _NX-1's_ bow tubes were not exactly in\nline to score a direct hit; she would have to be maneuvered slightly\nto port. The range was short; the explosion from the torpedoes would\nbe titanic.\n\nKeith punched the control studs, ordering the men below to assume\nfiring stations. Then, while waiting for the _NX-1_ to shift, he\nstudied the teleview screen to sight the range exactly. The black dot\nwhich represented the enemy craft was not directly on the crossed\nhair-lines of the dial-like range-finder, but shifting the _NX-1_ a\nfew feet would bring it to the perfect firing point.\n\nBut the _NX-1_ did not budge.\n\nSurprised, her commander swung and looked at Bowman. \"What the devil?\"\nhe cried. \"Did that shock--?\" He left the dread thought unfinished and\nleaped to the speaking tubes.\n\n\"Craig! Jones! Wetherby!\" he yelled. \"Men! Don't you hear me? Aren't\nyou--\"\n\nHe broke off, wordless, waiting for an answer that did not come, then\nsprang to the connecting ramp and ran to the deck below.\n\nThe scene he found halted him abruptly in his tracks. Every member of\nthe crew was sprawled on the deck, in grotesque, limp postures. They\nhad been standing rigidly at posts, he saw, when the thing, whatever\nit was, had struck. Without a sound, without a single cry of alarm,\nthe _NX-1's_ crew had been laid low!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe commander slowly advanced to the deck and stared more closely at\nthe upturned faces around him. He saw that every man's eyes were open.\n\nBending over one still form, he pressed his hand on the heart. It was\nbeating! The man was alive! Amazed, he moved to another and another:\nthey were all breathing, slowly and regularly--were all alive! A\ncurious look in their eyes staggered him for a moment. He could swear\nthat they recognized him, knew he was staring at them--for every\nsingle pair was alight with intelligence, and Keith fancied he saw\ngleams of recognition.\n\n\"It must have been a paralyzing ray!\" he gasped. \"A thing our\nscientists've been trying to develop for years.... And that monster\noutside knows the secret....\" He lifted an arm of the inert figure at\nhis feet; when he released the grip, it flopped limply back to the\ndeck again.\n\n\"_Keith! Come back, quick!_\"\n\nStartled, the commander turned to find Hemingway Bowman at the top of\nthe connecting ramp, his face distorted with alarm.\n\n\"For God's sake, come back quick!\" he yelled again. \"Down there the\nray might get you!\"\n\nWith the words, Wells leaped to the ramp and raced to the control\nroom. He had no sooner made it than he felt again the queer tingle of\nthe electric charge. He found himself trembling. Bowman's face was\nwhite. His words came stuttering.\n\n\"One second later and they'd have got you.... They got Sparks in his\ncubby.... You see, the ray doesn't affect us in the control room\nbecause--\"\n\n\"Because the Gibson insulation that protects the instruments keeps it\nout!\" Keith finished grimly. \"I see!\"\n\nJust then a slight jar ran through the submarine. Coincident with it\ncame a cry from Brown, the helmsman. His arm was pointed at the\nteleview.\n\nThere they saw the enemy's mighty dirigible of metal was now within\nthirty feet of the _NX-1._ It had crept up silently, without warning.\nAnd, spanning the short gulf between them, an arm of webbed metal\ncraned from the other's huge bow, hooking tightly into the American\nsubmarine's forward hawser holes!\n\nAs they took this in, the enemy ship moved away and the arm of metal\ntightened. The _NX-1_ shuddered. And, at first slowly, but with ever\nincreasing speed, she got under way and slid after her captor. They\nwere being towed away. Kidnaped! Men, submarine and all!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKeith Wells mopped sweat from a hot brow and rapidly reviewed his\nweapons. He was sorely restricted. Through an emergency system the\n_NX-1_ could be propelled and maneuvered from her control room; but\nthe torpedo tubes needed local attendance.\n\n\"Hemmy, reverse engines,\" he jerked, himself spinning over a small\nwheel. \"Let's see if we can out-pull the devil!\"\n\nAt once they felt the shock of the paralyzing ray, and then the\nsurging whine of the Edsel electrics pulsed up and in the teleview\nscreen they watched the grim struggle of ship against ship.\n\nImperceptibly, almost, as her screws cut in and churned, the forward\nprogress of the _NX-1_ was slowing, the speed of the other being cut\ndown, until finally they but barely forged ahead. Slowly, ever so\nslowly they were out-pulled; inch by inch they were dragged ahead.\nTheir motors could not hold even.\n\n\"She's more powerful than we!\" Wells' bitter voice spoke. \"Damn!\" He\nthought desperately, while Bowman and Brown stared at the fantastic\ntale the teleview spelled out.\n\nAgain the paralyzing shock tingled, an intangible jailer that bound\nthem, more surely than steel bars, to the control room. To dare that\nstreaming barrage meant instant impotence, and perhaps, later,\ndeath....\n\n\"Our two bow torpedoes,\" Keith mused slowly. \"We're a bit close, but\nit's our only chance. The ray comes at intervals of about a minute;\nthe torps are ready for firing. If one of us could dash forward and\ndischarge 'em.... Brown, that's you!\"\n\nThe petty officer met his commander's gaze levelly. He smiled. \"Yes,\nsir, I'm ready!\" he said.\n\n\"Good! It'll have to be quick work, though; I'll try and keep the sub\npointed straight. Wait for the ray, then run like hell!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe first officer took over the helm and Brown stepped to the forward\nladder, waiting for the periodic ray to be discharged.\n\nThe odd tingle came and vanished. \"Now!\" Wells roared, and Brown\nleaped down the thin steel rungs.\n\nHe staggered at the bottom from the force of his impact, then\nstraightened and raced madly forward. Through the drone of the motors\nthe two officers could hear the staccato beat of his feet.\n\nBut their eyes were glued to the teleview. Through clutching beds of\nseaweed the enemy submarine was ploughing. Her great, smooth bow lay\nstraight ahead, metal hawser arm spanning the thirty feet between\nthem. In another second, Keith thought grimly, two dynamite packed\ntubes of sudden death would thunderbolt into that hull, and--\n\nBrown pulled the lever.\n\nThe tubes spat out compressed air; a scream ran through the submarine;\nand the two steel fish leaped from their sheaths, their tiny props\nroaring. Over the narrow gulf they shot; the range was short, their\ntarget dead ahead--and yet by bare inches they missed!\n\nNo answering roar bellowed back. Keith had watched their course; had\nseen them flash by the enemy's bow, flicking it with their rudders,\nbut nothing more. \"Why?\" he cried. And, as Bowman moved his hands in a\nhopeless gesture, he saw in the teleview the reason.\n\nIt was a jagged pinnacle of rock, which, just before Brown had fired,\nhad been straight ahead. The towing monster had seen it and veered\nsharply to avoid crashing. The barest change of course, yet sufficient\nto avoid the torpedoes....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWells and Bowman were cursing savagely when the sound of Brown, racing\ndesperately aft, jerked the commander to the ladder. He saw the petty\nofficer at its foot. \"Hurry!\" Wells shouted. \"The ray!\"\n\nBrown grasped the steel rungs and scrambled upward, but he was too\nlate. The fatal charge tingled. A peculiar, surprised expression\nwashed over his face; his hands loosened their grip. For a second his\neyes looked questioningly at his commander; a faint sigh escaped him;\nand then his arms flung out, his body relaxed, and he slumped like a\nslab of meat to the deck below....\n\nKeith Wells saw red. Blind to everything, he was just about to charge\ndown the ladder to himself re-load the forward tubes when the grip of\nHemmy Bowman's hand stayed him. The thing Hemmy was staring at in the\nteleview screen sobered him completely.\n\nThe wall of rock to which the enemy submarine had first been charging\nhad become visible, soaring vastly from the gloom of the sea-floor.\nAnd the monster was towing them straight into a dark, jagged cleft at\nits base.\n\n\"It's a cavern!\" Keith breathed. \"A split in the rock--the lair of\nthat devil. And we're being dragged into it!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n_Sacrifice_\n\nAt that moment Keith Wells knew fear. Each second they were being\nhauled closer to the monster's dim lair. It lay there, dark,\nmysterious, fingered by gently swaying, clammy kelp. A hushed solitude\nseemed to reign over it, aweing all undersea life from the\nvicinity.... Wells turned his head to meet Bowman's eyes, and read in\nthem a silent question.\n\nWhat now?\n\nHe groaned in the agony of his mind. In a few minutes, all would be\nover. Once the _NX-1_ was dragged into that dark cavern there'd be no\nchance of escaping to warn the world above, of saving the submarine.\nWhat now? The question brought beads of sweat to his tormented brow.\nHe, Keith Wells, standing impotently by while his ship, the pride of\nthe service, was hauled inch by inch to some strange doom!\n\nRacked by these thoughts, he murmured tortured, jerky phrases,\nunconscious he was giving voice to the things that flogged his brain.\n\n\"What can I do? I've got to save my ship--I've got to get back to\nbreak the news--I've got to tell the world! But how? How--\" His\nexpression changed suddenly. \"That's it! That hawser arm between us\nmust be broken!\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nFirst Officer Hemingway Bowman's clear voice broke in on the older\nman's thoughts with that one crisp word. Keith swung to find the\nother's eyes fixed levelly on his.\n\n\"You're right, Keith. The hawser arm must be broken; with a depth\ncharge, of course. It's the only way.\n\n\"To attach a depth charge,\" he continued evenly, \"a man must leave the\nship. You can't, Keith. It will be me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe commander did not speak. \"I'll put on a sea-suit,\" Hemmy went on\nquickly, eyes lighting. \"You tip the submarine and I'll slide out the\nconning tower exit port on the lee side, so they can't see me, and\nworm forward through the kelp. We're almost holding them even; that'll\nbe easy. I'll be protected from the paralyzing shock until the last\nsecond, and it may not get me outside; that'll have to be chanced. The\nhawser arm's only some ten feet above the sea-floor; I can reach it\nwith a hook on the charge.\" He paused.\n\n\"I'll attach it; and when it bursts I'll try to get back and grab that\nring on the midships exit port, and you can let me in when we get to\nthe surface. But if I take too long, Keith--if I miss--you beat it\nwithout me. You understand? Beat it!\"\n\nHe gazed straight at his friend. \"Understand, Keith?\"\n\nCommander Keith Wells bowed his head in acquiescence. He was afraid\nthat if he met Hemmy Bowman's steady eyes he'd make a fool of\nhimself....\n\nHemmy glanced at the screen once more, shivering as he saw how near\nthe black cavern was. Then he moved rapidly, playing the cards\ncarefully for his gamble with death. He had to: the trumps were in the\nother hand.\n\nFrom the locker where their sea-suits were stowed he grabbed his own,\nand with quick fingers ripped the slides and fitted it on. A sheath of\nyellow Lestofabrik, its weighted feet and gleaming casque transformed\nhis slim figure into a giant such as might stalk through a nightmare.\nBuilt cunningly into the helmet was a tiny radio transmitter and\nreceiver, with a range of a quarter-mile; hugging to the shoulders,\ninside nestled the air-making mechanism, its tiny generators already\nin motion. Around the helmet was fastened a small removable\nundersea-light. The wrists of the suit were very flexible, permitting\nthe freest motion.\n\nOnce in the suit, Hemmy smiled through the still-opened face-shield.\n\n\"Got the depth charge ready, Keith? Make it fast--that cavern's\nnear!... Good!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSilently the commander fitted the black bomb to his friend's\nshoulders. It was timed to fire a minute after being set. A long wire\nhook craned from its top, and this hook Bowman would fasten on the\nhawser arm.\n\n\"Without Sparks, I guess I'll have to communicate with you through\nportable,\" Keith said, and quickly donned one of the tiny portable\nsets.\n\n\"Right. Ready, Keith.\"\n\nBowman started his awkward, crawling progress up the ladder into the\nconning tower just above, Keith helping from behind. When they stood\nbefore the exit port on the lee side, Wells shot back its bolts and\nthe door swung open, revealing the black emptiness of the water\nchamber. The commander gazed for a second into Bowman's eyes. The\nmoment had come.\n\nKeith turned his head away, felt a hand grip his. He wrung it\ntightly....\n\nBowman clumped into the chamber.\n\nThe commander closed and locked the door, and he heard the streaming\nwater pour in as Hemmy turned the valve. Then Wells sped down the\nladder and tilted the diving and course rudders of the submarine.\n\nShe swayed daintily over to port; held there. A moment later the\nrecurring electric tingle brushed him. Had the enemy seen Bowman\nleave? Had the ray struck him down?\n\nHe glared into the teleview. \"Thank God!\" he breathed. For Hemmy had\nalready slid down the _NX-1's_ smooth hull and was safe on the\nsea-floor beside her.\n\n\"Everything right?\" Wells asked, speaking into the microphone of his\nportable.\n\n\"All O.K.,\" came the answer. \"Going forward now. Kelp thick as hell.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKeith's eyes bored at the screen. This misshapen monster who was his\nfriend! Almost obscured by bands of thick-leaved kelp the yellow form\nmoved, hands clearing a pathway through the weeds. Slowly but surely\nhe made for the bow of the submersible.\n\n\"Hard going, Keith. God--the cavern's right ahead!\"\n\nIt was ghostly to hear Hemmy's warm voice from the lifeless solitude\noutside. Breath coming quickly, Wells watched the silent scene--the\ncleft in the wall of rock overshadowing everything now. The diver\nfought ahead, gaining inch by inch.\n\nNow, save for occasional clumps of weed, he was exposed to the\nenemy.... Now the last desperate gauntlet was reached.... Keith felt\nhis blood pound hotly.\n\n\"I'm gaining, Keith. Gaining....\"\n\nBowman had little breath for speech. His tiny form battled on, now\nsinking from sight as he dropped into some masked gully, now wrestling\nslowly with great swaying strands of kelp, but always struggling\nahead.\n\n\"I'm at the bow, Keith! The hawser arm's right in our mooring holes.\nI'll go halfway before fastening the charge. Any signs of life from\nthe devil?\"\n\n\"None yet, Hemmy. But go slow. Hide all you can, old man, for God's\nsake!...\"\n\nRight beneath the metal arm, Bowman's dwarfed figure crept doggedly\nahead. Forward, inch by breathless inch. Kelp thickened, washed away;\nthe two hulking submersibles, captor and captive, surged onward--but\njust a little faster went the valiant figure with the black charge on\nits back.\n\nThe towing monster had its snout in the cavern. The darkness\nthickened. Bowman was quarter way!\n\nHe plunged desperately. Half way!\n\n\"I'm there, Keith! Now for it!\"\n\n\"Oh, God!\" Wells cried. \"They see you; they're coming!\"\n\nFor he had seen strange shapes leaving the enemy submarine.\n\nAnd at that same moment, Bowman saw them, too.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey came like the blink of a dark eye from a door that had quickly\nslid open in the mysterious ship's bow. As tall as a man they were,\nand there were two of them, though at first the nature of their\nbodies merged with the wreathing kelp made them seem like a dozen.\nBowman stared at them, hypnotized with fear. His legs and arms went\ndead, and his whole gallant spirit seemed to slump into lifeless clay.\nNow he knew why the fishermen had shrieked \"machine-fish.\" Each one of\nthem had eight tapering arms, eight restless tentacles. These were\noctopi, most hideous scavengers of the ocean floor! And not only\noctopi--but octopi sheathed in metal-scaled armor!\n\nAs they came closer, he realized this preposterous fact. The dark\nsubstance of their writhing tentacles was not flesh: it was a coat of\nmetal scales. And the fat central mass which held their eyes and vital\norgans and beaked jaw--this mass was completely enveloped by a globe\nof glass. From inside, he could see great eyes staring at him. The\nmonsters came towards him quite slowly, obviously wary, advancing over\nthe sea-floor in what was a hideous mockery of walking, their forward\ntentacles outstretched.\n\nWith a sob, Hemmy Bowman pulled himself from his trance. He glanced\nback at the _NX-1_. He still had time to retreat. He might be able to\nget back inside before these monsters seized him.\n\nBut that meant abandoning his job. And already his own submarine was\nnosing into the cavern. The choice between the octopi and retreat\nstared him in the face. He pulled himself together and jerked his arms\nback to action.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEyes bulging, Keith Wells peered at the dim teleview screen. He saw\nthe creatures approaching Hemmy. And then, suddenly, he remembered his\nradiophone.\n\n\"Hemmy! Come back, for God's sake!\" he cried. \"Come back while you\ncan--it's hopeless!\"\n\nBut Bowman had already seized the depth charge from his back and\nhooked it on the hawser arm above.\n\nImmediately, with that action, all caution fled from the approaching\nmonsters. Their tentacles whipped furiously; and in a great arc they\nsprang for the tiny figure of the diver.\n\nWith a deep breath, Hemmy staggered forward to meet them. \"Keith!\" he\ngasped. \"I'll try to hold 'em away from the charge! When it bursts,\nzoom! Zoom like hell to the surface!\" And then the tentacles had him.\n\nKeith watched, cursing his impotence to help. Hemmy had no weapon; he\nwas trying to hold them back by the weight of his body; he reached out\nand grasped a tentacle and hugged it to him, shoving forward with all\nhis puny strength. But all his effort was as nothing. One of the\noctopi writhed past him and darted onto the depth charge. Its\ntentacles tugged at the bomb; pulled furiously.\n\nThe time charge exploded. The _NX-1_ rocked like a quivering reed;\nWells was knocked violently to the floor; a vast roar smote his\near-drums. When he staggered to his feet he found that the octopus\nthat was pulling at the charge had disappeared--blown into fragments\nof flesh and metal. But the hawser arm was broken! The _NX-1_, free,\nshot back a full fifty feet under the pull of her reversed screws. A\ncry echoed in her commander's ears:\n\n\"Go back, Keith! Go like hell!\"\n\nHe saw the remaining octopus lift Bowman and whip to the exit port of\nits submarine. The lid slid into place, closing on the monster and his\nfriend, and the enemy ship vanished into the black cavern....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOnce clear of the opening, Keith set his motors full forward and\nbrought the diving rudders up. Quickly the ship sped from the haunted\nsea-floor to the sun-warmed surface. A last thin call rang in his\nradiophone:\n\n\"They've got me inside, Keith. It's dark, and filled with water. I\ncan't see anything, but I--I guess we're going through the cavern....\nForget about me, old boy. So long! So--\"\n\nThe voice was abruptly cut off.\n\nKeith ripped the instrument from his head. Then, face white and drawn,\nhe ran to the radio cubby. Standing over Sparks' inert body, he put\nthrough a call to Robert Knapp, on the _Falcon_.\n\n\"Knapp?\" he said harshly. \"This is Wells. I'll be with you in a few\nminutes. Yes--yes--I'll tell you the whole story later. But get this\nnow: Have the day shift all ready to take over the submarine by the\ntime I pull alongside.\"\n\nHe said no more just then; but rang off, and, looking back, he\nmuttered savagely:\n\n\"But I'll be back, Hemmy--I'll be back!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n_In the Cavern_\n\n\"That's the story, Knapp. They got Bowman, and I had to run away.\nTheir ship disappeared into the cavern. I've got a hunch, though, that\nit's not just a cavern, but a tunnel, leading through to some\nunderwater world. That series of sub-sea earthquakes probably opened\nit up; and now these devil-octopi are free to pour out. I've _got_ to\nfind out what's what, and that's why I'm going down again as soon as\nthe torpedo system's ready!\"\n\nKeith and Robert Knapp were in the _Falcon's_ chart room. On the table\nbefore them lay a broad white map with a cross-mark indicating the\nposition of the mysterious dark cavern.\n\nWells was striding up and down like a caged tiger in his impatience to\nbe off. Every other minute he glared down to where the _NX-1_ lay\nalongside. On her conning tower stood the tall blond-haired figure of\nGraham, the first officer of the day shift, supervising the final\ndetails of the work of installing a system of jury controls whereby\nthe submarine's torpedoes could be fired from her control room.\n\nKeith stopped short and faced Knapp. \"It won't be so one-sided this\ntime, Bob,\" he promised. \"You see: when the location chart shows the\nenemy ship, I'll rush all men into the control room, where the\nparalyzing ray can't harm them. I don't know but what they have in\nother weapons, but I'm gambling on getting my torps in first. They've\nkilled Bowman; they've ravaged a whole fishing fleet; they're free to\nemerge from their hole and maraud every ocean on the globe! They've\ngot to be stopped! And since I'm armed and have the only submarine on\nthe spot, I've got to do it! I know how to fight them now!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCaptain Robert Knapp's sense of things was badly disordered. He had\njust heard a story which his common sense told him couldn't be true,\nbut which the evidence of his eyes had grimly authenticated. He had\nseen fifteen men slung aboard his ship from the _NX-1's_ silent hull;\nmen stretched in grotesque, limp attitudes; men struck down by a\nparalyzing ray. Why, no nation on earth had developed rays for\nwarfare! Yet--a crew of helpless men was even then in the sick bay,\nreceiving attention in the hope that they might recover.\n\n\"You're going right through that cavern, then, Wells?\" he asked\nincredulously. \"You're going to investigate what lies beyond?\"\n\n\"Nothing else! And I won't come out till I've blown that octopi ship\nto pieces!\"\n\n\"It sounds preposterous,\" Knapp murmured, shaking his head. \"Octopi,\nyou say--and clad in metal suits! Running a submarine more powerful\nthan the _NX-1_! Armed with a ray--a paralyzing ray! I can't\nbelieve--I can't conceive--\"\n\n\"You've seen the men!... Knapp, if I were you I'd swing my\neight-inchers out, bring up the plane catapult and keep the deck\ntorpedo tubes loaded and ready. It's best to be prepared; God knows\nwhat's going on underseas these days!\"\n\nFirst Officer Graham appeared at the door. \"Work finished, sir,\" he\nsaid. \"Ready to cast off.\"\n\n\"Thank heaven!\" Wells muttered, and stretched out his hand to Robert\nKnapp. \"Broadcast what I've told you, Bob, and say that the _NX-1_\nwon't be back till everything's under control. I'll keep in touch with\nyou. So long!\" And he was gone before the captain could even wish him\ngood luck.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOrders raced from her commander's fingers on the stud board in the\ncontrol room. \"Crash Dive\" filled her tanks and put her nose\nperilously down, so that in thirty seconds only a swirling patch of\nwater was left to show where once she'd lain. A brief command to the\nhelmsman and she pointed straight for the dark cavern marked on the\nchart.\n\nWhen well under way, Keith descended with Graham to inspect the new\ntorpedo firing system, and found it in good working order. \"Graham,\"\nhe ordered tersely, \"instruct the crew fully about rushing to the\ncontrol room on one ring of the general alarm. And send the cook up to\nme in a minute or so. I'll be in Sparks' cubby.\"\n\nAbove again, he instructed the radio man to rig a remote control\nsender and receiver in the insulated control room. The need for\ncentering the whole crew there during engagements would crowd the room\nawkwardly, but at other times, while proceeding on their inspection of\nthe cavern lair, they could remain at their regular posts.\n\nThat, at least, was Wells' plan.\n\nHe looked up and found the cook, McKegnie, grinning at him from the\ndoor of the control room. Keith smiled, running his eyes over the\nportly magnificence of his gently perspiring figure. \"Keg,\" he said\ncheerfully, \"I want you to move your hot plate and culinary apparatus\nup here; you see, we're all likely to be crowded in here for some\ntime, and your coffee's going to be an absolute necessity.\" He\ncouldn't resist a crack at McKegnie's well-known and passionate\ncuriosity as to what made the thigmajigs of the control board work:\n\"And besides, it'll give you a chance to observe the instruments and\nperfect yourself for your future career as a naval officer. Much\nbetter than a correspondence course in 'How to Be a Submarine\nCommander,' eh?\"\n\nCook McKegnie grinned sheepishly, and left. He was well used to such\njests, but he never would admit that his extraordinary interest in\nwatching the ship's wheels go round was accompanied by a miraculous\ninability to comprehend why they went round....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFifteen minutes later the helmsman's cry, \"Cavern showing, sir!\" swung\nthe commander to the teleview screen. The dark, kelp-shrouded opening\nhe knew so well was already looming on it. And he was prepared.\n\n\"Enter,\" he said, while his punched studs ordered, \"Quarter Speed,\nReady at Posts, Tanks in Trim.\" The _NX-1_ slackened her gait,\nbalanced cautiously, and struck a straight, even course as she crept\ncloser to the cleft entrance through which, some two hours earlier,\nthe octopi ship had nosed.\n\nScrews turning slowly, she edged through the jagged cavern. Shades of\ninky blackness grew on the teleview and danced in fantastic blotches;\nthe screen turned to a welter of black, threatening shadows; became a\nuseless maze of ever-changing forms. Keith mouthed curses as he stared\nat it; he now had nothing by which to judge his progress, to maneuver\nthe submarine, save directional instruments and, perhaps, chance\nscrapings of the tunnel's ragged walls against the outer hull. The\n_NX-1_ was running a gauntlet of immeasurable danger, her only\nassurance of success being the fact that a larger craft had preceded\nher.\n\nBut how far, Keith wondered, had that ship preceded her? How was he to\nknow that it had gone straight through? There might be a dozen\ndifferent turnings in this tunnel: the submarine could easily tilt\nhead-on against a jagged rock and puncture her hull. There might be\nmines planted directly in their course; he might be swimming straight\ninto some hideous ambuscade.\n\nHe drove these thoughts from his mind. The passage had to be made on\nthe fickle authority of the senses; and, realizing this, Wells took\nthe helm into his own hands. Graham was posted at the location chart,\nwith instructions to report the red light if it showed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDown below, the Edsel electrics were humming very softly; the men\nstood vigilantly at posts. On their brows were little beads of sweat,\nand here and there a hand clenched nervously. All knew they were in a\ntight place; otherwise they were ignorant of where their commander was\nleading them. Occasionally a long, shivering rasp ran through the ship\nas her hull nudged the rough tunnel wall. Then the course rudders\nwould swing gently over; and perhaps, almost immediately, another\ngrinding cry of rock and steel would come from the other side. Then\nwould come quickly indrawn breaths as the rudders swung again and the\nhumming silence droned on.\n\nThe scrapings came quite often. Often, too, the motors would go silent\naltogether, and the _NX-1_ would rest almost motionless as her\ncommander felt for an opening. It was a tense, nerve-wringing ordeal.\nThe silence, the waiting, the dainty scrapings were maddening.\n\nKeith Wells' skin was prickling. He kept only fingertips on the tiny\nhelm: he was playing that uncanny sixth sense of the submarine\ncommander. When it misled him, the rasping rock groaned out, scarring\nthe submarine's smooth skin. Generally, the tunnel was straight; but\neach time he heard his ship rub against some exterior obstruction, his\nteeth went tight--for who knew but what it might be a mine?\n\nThey had penetrated perhaps a half-mile when Graham, eyes steady on\nthe teleview, reported: \"Light growing, sir!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWells saw that the screen was filling with a soft, faintly glowing\nbluish color. The walls of the tunnel became visible, and he noted\nthat they were widening out, funnel-like. He dared to increase speed\nslightly. Three minutes later he saw that the blue illumination was\nseeping from the end of the tunnel. They continued out.\n\n\"Thank God, we're through!\" he muttered to Graham. \"You see, I was\nright! It's an underground sea--and we're at the top of it.\" For the\ninstruments indicated a depth beneath them of roughly three miles.\nThey were in, evidently, a large cavern, of vast length and depth.\n\nThe _NX-1_ continued slowly forward, two pairs of eyes intent on her\nteleview screen. Keith jotted down the tunnel's position, and the\nfunnel-shaped hole sank away behind their slow screws. And then, upon\nthe location chart, a faint red dot suddenly glowed!\n\nIt was upon them in a flash. A small tube of metal, shaped somewhat in\nthe form of the big octopi submarine, had darted up from below,\nhovered a second close to them, and then, almost before they realized\nthey were being surveyed, sped back into the mysterious depths from\nwhich it had come.\n\n\"A lookout, I suppose,\" Keith muttered, breathing more easily.\n\"Couldn't have held more than two of those creatures.... Well, the\nalarm's out, I guess, Graham, but it can't be helped. Let's see what\nit's like down below.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey plunged steadily down, then ahead. And presently there grew on\nthe teleview vague forms which widened their eyes and made their\nbreath come quicker. Keith had guessed the tunnel led to a\ncivilization of some kind, but he was not prepared for the sight that\nloomed hazily through the soft blue water.\n\nStrange, moundlike shapes appeared far below, mounds grouped in\norderly rows and clusters, with streets running between them, thronged\nwith tiny, spidery dots. Octopi! It was, the commander realized, a\ncity of the monsters--a complete city like those of surface peoples!\nFor several miles in every direction the water-city spread out,\nfarther than the teleview could pierce. Wells marveled at this\nseparately developed civilization, this deep-buried realm of octopi\nwhose unexpected intellectual powers had permitted such development.\nPerhaps, he pondered, this city was only one of many; perhaps only a\nvillage. He could but vaguely glimpse the queer mound buildings, but\nsaw that they were of varying height and were filled with dark round\nentrance holes, through which the creatures streamed on their\ndifferent errands....\n\nHe saw no schools of fish around. \"I guess they're been all killed\noff, or eaten,\" he commented to the wonder-struck Graham. \"Probably\nthe octopi have separate hatcheries where they raise them for food.\"\n\n\"But--good Lord!\" the first officer exclaimed. \"A city--a city like\nours! Down here, filled with octopi!...\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Wells grimly, \"and this 'city' may only be a small\nsettlement; there may be scores of these places. We'd better continue\nahead now that we're here; for we've got to get all the information we\ncan. I only hope these monsters haven't more than one big submarine.\nWe can expect an attack any minute....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe _NX-1_ pressed on. The city dropped behind. A breathless tenseness\nhad settled down over the submarine; she was proceeding with utmost\ncaution, her anxious officers alert at the location chart. The great\nfear that tormented them was that they might be attacked, not by one,\nbut by a fleet of the octopi ships....\n\nThen, at the rim of the chart, a red dot appeared! It grew rapidly,\ncharging down on them at great speed. The spot was large; this was no\nsmall sentry boat! At once the alarm bell shrilled its warning; the\ncrew below left their posts and raced to the control room. With sure\nmechanical fingers the emergency system gripped the valve handles and\nmotor levers; Keith swung the _NX-1_ onto a level keel, straightened\nher out, and decreased speed still more. Giving the rods of the motor\nand rudder controls to Graham, he moved to the small lever which would\nunleash his bow torpedoes, and fingered it lightly. The _NX-1_ was\nready for action.\n\nScarcely had the men reached the small control room than the familiar\nelectric charge tingled. They stared wonderingly at each other, half\nafraid. No one seemed hurt. One hand on the torpedo lever, Wells\nwatched his charts and instruments. He thanked God that there was only\none of the enemy.\n\nThe ray's shock came again--and stronger. The red dot was practically\nupon them. The screen was still empty. Coolly, Keith slowed the\nsubmarine to a dead stop. The crimson stud came closer....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd then he saw it. It was the same fearsome, hulking form. The same\ncurving windows, dark and lifeless. The same knobs on its bow, one now\nleaping and pulsing with the paralyzing glow. At a distance of a few\nhundred feet the octopi ship swerved to a halt, dousing the NX-1 with\nits ray unceasingly. Again those two underwater craft, so oddly\ncontrasted, were face to face. And again the weapon that had once\nstruck the American ship's crew down at their posts was directed full\nonto the _NX-1_.\n\nBut it was harmless! It merely tingled, and did not paralyze! The\ncontrol room sheathing held it out stoutly. The men's faces showed\noverwhelming relief.\n\nKeith smiled grimly. Now, at least, he had the devils where he wanted\nthem; now it was his turn to strike with a--to them--terrible,\nmysterious weapon. They had attacked; had failed--and now he could\nsquare up for Hemmy and send a pair of torpedoes into that ship of\nhideous tentacles.\n\n\"Port five!\" The ship swerved slightly. \"Hold even!\" The enemy craft\nwas very close. The _NX-1's_ bow tubes were sighted in direct line.\nHer torpedoes could not possibly miss. This time, destruction for the\noctopi ship was inevitable....\n\nKeith Wells gripped the lever that held the torps in leash.\n\n\"_Wait!_\"\n\nSparks, a bare foot from him, yelled out the word. Wells, alarmed,\nreleased his grip on the knob. The radio operator was listening\nintently, a circle of taut faces around his crouched back. He swung\nexcitedly around.\n\n\"For God's sake, don't fire!\" he cried. \"Hemingway Bowman's on that\nsubmarine! He's alive--and calling for you!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n_The Other Weapon_\n\nBowman--alive!\n\nKeith Wells let go the torpedo lever. His whole orderly plan of action\nwas crashed in a second.--For an instant he stood gaping at the radio\nman, forgetful of the peril outside, striving desperately to hit on\nsome way of surmounting this unlooked-for obstacle. The idea of firing\non his friend--killing Hemmy Bowman with his own hand--paralyzed his\nbrain.\n\nAnd in that unguarded instant the octopi struck.\n\nFrom the bow of the enemy submarine, slanting from another of its\npeculiar knobs, a narrow beam of violet light poured, cutting a vivid\nswathe across the teleview. The huddled men stared at it, not\ncomprehending what it was. They felt no shock of electricity, nor\ncould they discern any other harmful effect. The ray held steadily on\ntheir bow, not varying in the slightest, for a full thirty seconds.\nAnd still none of them could feel or see any damage.\n\nWells, however, gradually became aware that he was bathed in\nperspiration, that great streams of sweat were coursing down his\nface. A quick glance told him that every member of the crew was the\nsame way; and then, suddenly, he was conscious of a wave of intense\nheat--heat which quickly became terrific. The control room was\nstifling!\n\nBefore he could act, the _NX-1_ slipped sharply to one side. A sharp\nhissing sound grew at her bow, climbing steadily to a shriek. Long\nstreamers of white steam crept along the lower deck and seeped up into\nthe control room. And then rose the fatal sound of rushing\nwater--water pouring into the submarine from outside!\n\nFor the violet beam was a heat ray--a weapon surface civilizations had\nnot yet developed. While the _NX-1's_ crew had stared at it in the\nteleview, it had melted a hole in their bow.\n\nImmediately the submarine lost trim, and the deck tilted ominously. In\nthe face of material danger--danger from a source he understood--the\ncommander became cool and methodical.\n\n\"Sea-suits on!\" he snapped. \"Then forward and break out steel\ncollision-mat and weld it in place! Every man! You, too, Sparks and\nMcKegnie!\"\n\n\"But--but, sir!\" stammered Graham. \"Do you want them to get us with\ntheir paralyzing ray?\"\n\n\"You'd rather drown?\" Wells flung back. Silenced, the first officer\ndonned his sea-suit, and in thirty seconds the rest of the crew had\ntheirs on and were cluttering clumsily forward.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAlone in the control room, Keith battled with the unbalancing flow of\nwater, maneuvering with all his skill in a futile attempt to keep the\n_NX-1_ on even keel. The men forward worked with great speed, spurred\non by the realization that they were fighting death itself, but even\nas they labored the submarine swung in ever increasing rolls and dips;\nthe great weight of water she had shipped slopped back and forth; her\nbow went steadily down. Keith swept her forward tanks clean of water,\nalways conscious of the immobile, staring octopi submarine in the\nteleview, watching them, it seemed, curiously, and not driving home\ntheir advantage with additional bolts of the violet heat ray.\n\nDespite her commander's frantic efforts, the _NX-1_ fluttered down\nremorselessly; the cavern floor rose, and, sinking with them, came the\noctopi craft, in slow mockery of a fighting plane pursuing its\nstricken foe to the very ground....\n\nShe struck bottom with a soft, thudding jar, and settled on even keel.\nAt once Wells released the helm, jumped into his own sea-suit and\nstumbled down to take command.\n\nHe found the steel collision-mat in place, and the welding of it\nnearly completed. A few feathery trickles of water still seeped\nthrough on each side, but under his terse directions the pumps were\nsoon draining it out. The weird figures of the crew in their sea-suits\nlooked like creatures from another planet as they rapidly finished the\njob.\n\n\"All right--up to the control room, everybody! Fast!\" Wells roared.\n\nThe men stumbled aft as rapidly as they could in their cumbersome\nsuits. Several were already on the ladder. A few feet further--\n\nBut at that moment the paralyzing ray again stabbed into the ship--and\nKeith Wells slumped helplessly to the deck. And as he crumpled, he\nglimpsed the grotesque, falling figures of his men, and saw one come\ntumbling down the ladder from the control room, where he had almost\nreached safety....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPeculiar sensations, unendurable thoughts raced through the commander\nas he lay there limply. He knew his predicament. He wanted desperately\nto rise, to rush to the control room. Time and time again in those\nfirst few moments of impotence he strove mightily to pull his limbs\nback to life. But his greatest efforts were barren of result, save to\nleave him feeling still weaker. The fate that he had seen strike down\nBrown now enmeshed him. He was paralyzed. Helpless. In the midst of\nhis crew.\n\nAfter a moment all sensation left his body. His limbs might not have\nexisted. Sensation, pain, lived only in his brain--and there it was\nterrible, because self-created.\n\nHe found himself sprawled flat on his back, his eyes directed stiffly\nupward. He could not move them, but out of the corners he vaguely\nsensed the other figures around him. Helpless, every one! And who knew\nif they would ever come out of the spell! Victory had gone to the\noctopi....\n\nMinutes that seemed like hours passed. And then a well-remembered\nvoice sounded in the radio earphones in his helmet. It was Hemmy\nBowman, speaking from the enemy ship.\n\n\"Keith! Keith Wells! Are you there?\" the voice cried. \"Keith! What\nhave they done to you?\"\n\nAnd Keith, he could not answer! He could not answer that troubled\nvoice of his friend--that voice from a friend he had thought dead.\n\nAgain Bowman spoke. \"Keith! Can't you hear me? What are they doing to\nyou? Oh--\" For a moment it stopped, then came once more, thick with\nanguish. \"Oh, God, what's happened?\" Then lower: \"If only there were\nlight, so I could see what they're doing....\" The voice tapered into\nsilence. Keith could picture Hemmy, probably bound, giving him up for\ndead....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen, quite distinctly, he heard a clank at the _NX-1's_ bow! The\nsubmarine jerked, her bow tilted up--and with increasing speed she\nmoved forward, silently as a ghost.\n\nKeith thought he knew what that meant. The octopi ship had grasped\nthem with another of its hawser arms, and was pulling them away. But\nwhere to? One of those mound cities? His brain was a turmoil as he\ntried to imagine what was before them. But all he could do was lie\nthere and wait.\n\nThe American craft was towed for perhaps ten minutes--ten ages to her\ncommander--then coasted slowly to a pause, and with a sharp jar\nsettled into rest. As she did so, every light in her hull went\nsuddenly out.\n\nIt had been bad enough with the lights on, but the darkness was far\nworse. The submarine was a tomb--as silent as one, and full of men who\nlived and yet were dead. Hemmy Bowman's voice came no more to Wells.\nHe was alone with his moiling doubts and fears and unanswerable\nquestions, and he knew that every other man there was alone with them,\ntoo....\n\nAs his eyes became partially accustomed to the darkness, he could\ndistinguish vaguely the forms of the familiar mechanisms above him. A\nslight noise grew suddenly and resolved itself into a prolonged\nscraping along the outer hull of the submarine. At intervals it paused\nand gave way to a series of sharp, definite taps.\n\nKeith realized what those sounds signified: the octopi were striving\nto find some entrance to the _NX-1_! This, he told himself, was the\nend. The creatures would break through; water would rush in, and every\nman would drown. For the face-shields of their sea-suits were open!\n\nThe dull scrapings ran completely around the motionless submarine,\npunctuated with the same staccato tappings. By the movement of the\nsound, Wells realized the octopi were approaching the lower starboard\nexit port. And as they neared that port, the noise abruptly stopped.\n\nThen for some minutes silence fell. Next, the commander heard what was\nunmistakably the exit port's water chamber being filled--and a moment\nlater emptied again. The devilish creatures had solved the puzzle of\nthe means of entrance!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the awful darkness the inner door of the port swung open. A slow,\nslithering sound came to Wells' ears. He sensed, though he could not\nsee, the presence of alien creature. An odor struck his nostrils--that\nof fish....\n\nA deliberate something crawled directly across one outstretched arm,\nand another across his legs. And above him loomed a monstrous,\ncomplicated shadow, which, after a moment, slowly melted from his line\nof vision. Panicky, he strove again to bring his limbs back to life,\nbut still could not....\n\nKeith knew that in the darkness which their huge unblinking eyes could\npenetrate they were inspecting the _NX-1's_ interior, examining the\nmen stretched on its deck, feeling them with their cold metal-scaled\ntentacles. Another complicated shadow crept back over the commander's\nline of sight, and from all around rose the slithering, shuffling\ntread of the octopi's many tentacles, rasping on the steel flooring.\n\nSweat from Wells' forehead trickled down and stung his eyes as he lay\nin that dark agony. There seemed to be countless investigating\ntentacles feeling through the entire submarine. One of them,\niron-hard, suddenly coiled under his armpit and lifted him lightly as\na feather from the deck. Another snaked up and clicked his face-shield\nsecurely shut. Keith heard other clicks, and knew that the shields of\nhis men were likewise being closed.\n\nThe commander was held straight out from the octopus' revolting body,\nand as he swung, helpless, he could see that more men were grasped\nsimilarly in other mighty arms. Dangling in the shadow-filled darkness\nhe was carried slowly to the exit port, and he heard the inner door\nswing open, then close again. Water streamed through the valves; it\nencompassed him with a feeling of lightness, a feeling of floating, as\nhe swung at the end of the long metal-sheathed tentacles. A moment\nlater a soft bluish glow burst on his vision, and he saw that he was\noutside. There was a long wait, and when the current next swung him\naround he was dismayed to see that every one of the monstrous\ncreatures near him was dangling on high two or three men of his\nhelpless crew. The whole outfit was in the power of the devil-fish!\n\nAnd then their captors moved forward with them on a ghastly march of\ntriumph....\n\nBut Keith Wells did not know that, crouched behind the instrument\npanel in the control room, shivering and sick with fear, was the plump\nform of Cook Angus McKegnie, who had just gained it just before the\nparalyzing ray had struck.\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n_The Monster with the Armlets of Gold_\n\nHemingway Bowman's ardent wish, after he was whipped quickly through\nthe round exit port of the octopi submarine, was for a quick, clean\ndeath. The horror and mystery of his situation had left him with one\nconscious emotion, that he was afraid. The worst had been when he was\nhauled through the port; when, expecting anything, he had been able to\nsee nothing in the dark, water-filled mystery ship.\n\nDeliberate tentacles had stroked over every inch of his\nbody--tentacles that were not metal-scaled, as had been the arms of\nthe creature that captured him. It was then that he guessed the true\npurpose of the metal suits the octopi wore--to protect their bodies\nagainst the lesser pressure near the surface of the sea. Inside the\nsubmarine they did not need them. He decided that the ship was used\nfor rapidly transporting large numbers of the octopi to distant\nregions, and also for a weapon of offense and defense. The\nintelligence of the cuttlefish astounded him.\n\nKeith had got away. At least he knew that, and he thanked God for it.\nHis bold stroke had not been in vain, his sacrifice not useless.\n\nAfter the inspection of the tentacles, Hemmy had been shoved to a\ncorner of the octopi submarine. He had felt cords wrapped around his\nbody. After being thus secured, he was left to himself. He was utterly\nalone, except for strange, vague shadows that floated through the\ndarkness--shadows that heated his brain as he realized how many of\nthe devil-fish there were.\n\nHours that seemed like endless days passed.\n\nBowman concluded that the submarine had gone straight through the\ncavern and emerged finally into what seemed to be another sea. Dead\nsilence filled the ship. What was happening, he could only guess. The\ncraft seemed to run on forever. Never once did tentacles brush or\ninspect him again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFinally the ship stopped, and a great round door opened in one wall.\nBy the soft bluish glow that seeped in Hemmy caught a glimpse of his\nsurroundings, and his gorge rose at the sight. The ship was literally\nfilled with a slowly waving forest of long black tentacles. Weird\ninstruments, unlike anything he had ever seen, were grouped around the\nwalls, and before them attendant octopi poised, their hideous eyes\nfixed and steady. There were no dividing decks as in the _NX-1_; the\ncraft was one huge shell.\n\nThen came furious activity. The door fell shut again, and the ship\nshot off at great speed. Hemmy felt sure that they were advancing to\nagain attack the _NX-1_, and at once began to try to reach his\ncomrades through radiophone. He knew that Wells would come back.\n\nFinally he caught a human voice, and heard the _NX-1's_ radio operator\nshout to the commander that he, Bowman, was alive and calling. But\nwhen he tried to speak further, the American craft's radio was silent.\n\nAnd then, in the octopi submarine, had come a soft glow of violet....\n\nWas it a more deadly weapon than the paralyzing ray? In great suspense\nthe prisoner waited. Silence--silence! Horrible doubts beset his mind.\nWas Keith refraining from firing his torpedoes because he, Bowman, was\non board the enemy boat? The thought stung him. He tried desperately\nagain to reach Wells; but there was no answer. Were the Americans\ndead?\n\nAge-long minutes passed. Then the exit port opened and several\nmetal-clad octopi swam out. Hemmy had a glimpse of the _NX-1_ lying\nsilent and apparently lifeless on the sea-floor, a gaping hole in her\nbow!\n\nAs if to taunt him with the sight, the creatures left the round door\nopen, and presently Bowman beheld the octopi open the _NX-1's_\nstarboard exit port and enter. Later the port swung open again, and he\nsaw the monsters emerge, each gripping several men clad in yellow\nsea-suits! That they were dead, or victims of the ray, was obvious\nfrom the way they limply dangled.\n\nThe exit port closed, and darkness filled the octopi ship. Hemmy\nBowman panted with the futile effort to break his bonds.\n\n\"You devils!\" he yelled in blind rage, exhausted. \"Why don't you take\nme with them? Take me! Take me, damn your stinking hides!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Keith Wells was taken from the silent _NX-1_, a host of\nastounding impressions swarmed his brain. Swinging lightly at the end\nof his captor's tentacle, he strove as best he could, with eyes\nrigidly fixed straight ahead, to grasp his new surroundings. He had,\nfirst, one flash of the octopi ship lying quite close to them, its\nhulk, as always, immobile and apparently lifeless. And inside it, he\nwas sure, was his friend and first officer, Hemmy Bowman--a captive.\n\nHe saw that the octopi submarine had towed the _NX-1_ into one of the\nweird mound cities. His own ship was lying in what seemed a kind of\npublic square, and crowds of black octopi were swarming around it as\nhe and his crew were brought out. Shooting straight off the square ran\none of the wide streets he had previously seen from above, and on each\nside the brown mound-buildings rose. Their details were hazy, because\nof the cuttlefish inhabitants who swam thickly in front of them.\n\nHis captors started their march down this broad street. Great crowds\nof reddish-colored octopi clustered on each side of it; other swarms\nhung almost motionless--except for their constantly writhing\ntentacles--above, so that their line of progress was through what\nresembled a restless, living tunnel of repulsive black flesh, snaky\narms and huge, unblinking eyes. Keith felt faint from the horror of\nit. Thousands of the monsters were there, all hanging in the soft,\nblue-glowing water; and occasionally, as he floated almost\nhorizontally in his captor's firm grip, his legs would brush the wall\nof clammy flesh; or perhaps one of the tentacles would reach out as if\nto touch him.\n\nThe octopus that held him swam some five feet off the street bed\nitself; at intervals the thick swarm on either side would part for a\nsecond, and Keith could glimpse the huge mound-buildings, ever growing\nlarger, with round entrance holes dotted all over their smooth\nsurface, above as well as the sides.\n\nThe march was ghastly. Their captors were taking them through the\nheart of the water-metropolis; displaying their human captives as did\nthe Caesars in Roman triumphs of old!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe swarming crowds of tentacled monsters grew thicker as they\nprogressed, and their tentacles began to whip more quickly, as if\nanger was burning in their loathsome bodies. Keith noted the menace of\ntheir sharp-beaked jaws, and the sickening sucker-discs on the livid\nunder-side of the tentacles. As far as he could see, the swarms fell\nin behind the procession after it had passed. Following them--where?\n\nJust as Wells felt himself on the verge of fainting, the procession\nturned to the right and entered the largest mound-building of all, a\nvast dome rising in the very center of the octopi metropolis. They\ncontinued through a corridor perhaps twenty feet high, from which at\nintervals other corridors branched. Held by one arm, and ever and\nagain turning helplessly over in his horizontal transit, Keith caught\nglimpses of walls covered with intricate designs on a basic\neight-armed motif--designs of artistic value, that gave evidence of\nculture and civilization.\n\nThe passage ended as suddenly as it had begun, and they came into the\nmain body of a gigantic building.\n\nThe commander could hardly credit his eyes. The place resembled a\nstadium, and was so vast that he felt dwarfed to nothingness. The\ndomed roof soared far above in misty bluish light. On the floor,\nexactly beneath the center of the great dome, was a raised platform,\nand on it a dais resembling a very wide throne. Around the dais a\nscore or more of octopi--officials, Keith supposed--were grouped.\n\nRapidly the creatures following the procession swam into the chamber.\nMonstrously large as the place was, the floor soon was filled with the\nthick flood of cuttlefish which swarmed in from many doors. Keith,\nheld with the other captives just to one side of the hole he had\nentered by, began to think that they must soon refuse to let any more\nin--when, to his surprise, he saw the latest arrivals begin to form a\ngallery twenty feet above those on the ground floor, and, when this\nwas extended far back and completely filled, start yet another above\nit--and another, and another.... In ten minutes the mighty hall was\ncrowded with countless layers of the cold-eyed monsters, each layer\nangling up from the central dais so that all could see.\n\n\"God!\" the commander thought. \"Nothing but solidly-packed devil-fish\nall the way to the dome! A slaughter pit! And we, of course, are to be\nthe cattle!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMinutes passed. The throne was still empty, and the thousands in the\namphitheater seemed waiting for an occupant. Keith wished he was able\nto close his eyes. The restless, never-ceasing weaving of the\ncountless tentacles in the levels above made the scene a nightmare.\nSome waved slowly, others whipped excitedly, but never for an instant\ndid one pause. The movements were like the never-ceasing shifting and\nswaying of the trunks and feet of elephants; in the dim glow the huge\nchamber seemed to be filled with one fantastic, million-tentacled\nmonster that stared with its thousand eyes down on the forlorn group\nof puny human beings....\n\nAs if at a command the arms of the octopi on the platform suddenly\nbegan to weave in perfect unison in some weird ceremony. First they\nswayed out towards the waiting captives, then they swerved slowly to\nthe empty throne. Then came a few quick, excited whippings; and once\nmore the long arms reached out at the small group at the entrance.\nThis went on for some minutes. Then, very suddenly, a creature swam up\nfrom what must have been an opening in the floor onto the dais-throne.\n\nKeith saw it well.\n\nIt was an octopus, a giant amongst octopi, and Wells knew at once it\nwas the ruler of the realm, the lord and master of the swarming\ngalleries and the cities of mound-buildings.\n\nIt was larger than its fellows by a full three feet. And, encircling\neach great tentacle just where it joined the central mass of flesh,\nwas a broad, glittering band of polished gold--eight thick armlets\nthat ringed the creature's revolting head-body with a circle of\ngleaming pagan splendor. Keith could almost fancy that a certain royal\nair hung over the monster.\n\nThe huge, unblinking eyes of the king stared at the horror-frozen\ncaptives. One long tentacle lifted slowly upward, and their captors at\nonce started towards the throne with them. The score of octopi on each\nside stilled their weaving arms. A battery of emotionless eyes drilled\ninto Wells' paralyzed body. He felt faint. Unquestionably the horrible\nceremony was leading up to some form of cold-blooded sacrifice....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe monarch stretched a mighty arm towards Keith, and, as in a dream,\nhe felt himself lifted out of his guard's grasp. The snakelike\ntentacle gripped him about the waist, and held him dangling like a\npuppet twenty feet in the water while the two deadly eyes stared\nsteadily at him. He was brought closer, until the hideous central\nmass, with its cruel beaked jaw and ink sac hanging behind, was no\nmore than a foot away.\n\nThen another arm stroked slowly along the commander's helpless body.\nOnce or twice it prodded sharply, and Wells felt a surge of fear, for\nhis sea-suit might break. Deliberately the prying tentacle moved over\nhim, delicately feeling his helmet, his weighted feet, his legs.\n\nKeith Wells grew angry. He was being inspected like a trapped monkey!\nHe, commander of the _NX-1_, representative of one of the world's\nmightiest nations--prodded and stared at by this fish, this octopus! A\ngreat rage suffused him, and with a terrific effort he tried to jab\nhis arms into one of those devilish eyes. But try as he might, his\nbody would not respond. He could not move a finger.\n\nFor a long time the loathsome inspection continued, until the\nmonstrous king seemed satisfied. Wells was handed back. There followed\nan interminable period in which nothing whatever was done, as far as\nhe could see. He was sure that they must be talking, debating, but no\nsound reached his ears through the tight helmet. All the time the\nendless motion in the swarming levels above went on. It became hazy,\ndreamlike, and in spite of himself the commander began to feel drowsy.\nThe weaving and swaying was producing a hypnotic effect. At last the\ndesire to sleep grew overpowering.\n\nWells and his men were more than half unconscious when their original\ncaptors finally pulled them back from the royal presence and began a\nhumble retreat from the throne room. Slowly they backed to the\nentrance. Keith's last drowsy glimpse was of a grotesque, gold-ringed\nmonster on a throne, with a score of smaller tentacled creatures\naround him, and a vast haze of weaving tentacles and unblinking eyes\nabove.\n\nThey passed from the huge chamber. The commander felt delirious, as in\na nightmare, but he knew that they were again in the long corridor,\nand that their captors were taking them further into the mighty\nbuilding, further from the street outside. He glimpsed great rooms\nbranching off the corridor, and swarms of black octopi inside them.\nThe light became fainter; and at last the procession turned into a\nseparate, rough-walled chamber, dimly lit and empty.\n\nWells felt the grip around his arm loosen, and he floated limply to\nthe floor among his men. He slept....\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n_The Glass Bell Jar_\n\nKeith awoke hours later.\n\nSlowly he became conscious of a cramped, stiff body, of a dull pain\nracking his head. He stretched out his limbs--and, suddenly, realized\nhe could move.\n\nRemembering the paralyzing ray that had struck him down, and half\nafraid that his senses were tricking him, he kicked his left leg out.\nIt moved with its old vigor. He quickly found that his strength had\nreturned, that he could feel and move. The effect of the ray had worn\noff!\n\nWith a glow of new hope he rose to his feet and exercised numb\nmuscles. Looking around, he saw the other men still stretched out on\nthe floor of their rough-walled, watery prison. He called into his\nradiophone mouthpiece:\n\n\"Graham! Graham, wake up!\" A grotesque figure stirred among its\nfellows; turned over. \"It's Wells, Graham,\" Keith continued. \"Get up;\nyou can, now!\" And he watched the form of his big first officer\nstretch out and finally rise, while stupid, sleepy sounds came to his\nradio receiver.\n\n\"Why--why; the paralysis is gone!\" Graham said at length.\n\n\"Yes, but maybe the octopi don't know it. Rouse the other men at once,\nand we'll see what we can do.\"\n\nIt was weird, the sight of the lifeless figures of the men stirring to\nlife in the dim-lit water as Graham shook each one's shoulder. The\nradiophones buzzed and clicked with their excited comments and\nejaculations. Keith felt much better. With his men restored to\nstrength, and clustered in a determined, hard-fighting mass, he saw a\nhope of breaking out and regaining the _NX-1_.\n\nHe let them exercise as he had for some minutes, then proceeded to a\nbrisk roll-call. There should be fifteen men and two officers. Rapidly\nGraham ran over the names, and each time a voice rang back in\nreply--until he came to the cook.\n\n\"McKegnie?... Cook McKegnie?\"\n\nThere was no answer. Wells stared around the group of dim figures and\nhimself called the name again. But McKegnie was not present. And as\nthe commander and his men realized it the numbing spell of their\ndesperate position settled down on them again like a shroud.\n\nKeith shook off the mood. \"Well,\" he muttered, \"I guess the devils got\nhim. Poor McKegnie's seen the wheels go round for the last time....\nAll right: take command, Graham. I'm going to do a little\nreconnoitering.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe round entrance hole was some fifteen feet from him, at the far end\nof the cell. Keith advanced cautiously to it, the peculiar light\nfeeling the water gave him making his steps uncertain. The dim blue\nillumination made the details of the corridor outside hazy, shadowy,\nbut it seemed to be empty. Peering out, Wells could sight no guarding\noctopi. He edged closer and stared down to the left. Twenty feet away\nthe vague light tapered into darker gloom, filled with thick, wavering\nshadows; but it was apparently devoid of tentacles. He wondered if\nthe octopi were unaware that the effects of their ray had worn off,\nand peeped cautiously around the edge to the right.\n\nImmediately a long arm whipped out, grasped him around the waist and\nflung him twisting and turning back into the chamber. Graham\nlaboriously made his way to the commander and helped him to his feet.\n\"Hurt, sir?\" he asked anxiously.\n\n\"No,\" Keith gasped. \"But that devil--\"\n\nHe stopped short. The first officer turned and followed his\ncommander's stare.\n\nThe entrance hole of the cell had filled with a monstrous shape. A\nhuge octopus was resting there, its unblinking eyes coldly surveying\nthe crew of the _NX-1_. On each of its thick tentacles was a broad\nband of polished gold. It was the king, the same creature that had\ninspected them from the throne-dais a few hours before. And behind him\nin the corridor the men glimpsed another octopus.\n\nSlowly the ruler of the octopi swam into the chamber. Its great eyes\ncentered icily on Keith Wells, standing at the head of his cowering\nmen; and its mighty tentacles waved slowly, gracefully, as if the\ncreature stood in doubt. One of them tentatively reached out and\nhovered over their heads, moving uncertainly back and forth. Then,\nlike a monstrous water snake, the tentacle poised, flicked out and\nplucked a man from his comrades.\n\nHis shriek of terror rasped in their earphones. \"Steady, men!\" Keith\ncried. \"It's hopeless to try and fight them! The monster just wants to\nlook him over!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe man--Williams, a petty officer--was dangled by the armpit in\nmid-water and made to slowly revolve. The tip of another huge arm\nsnaked out and for some seconds stroked his body, probing curiously.\nHe panted with fright, and in their earphones his friends could hear\nhis every tortured exhalation. Anxiously, Keith watched. Then,\nwithout warning, another tentacle darted up, fastened its tip on the\nbreast of the captive's sea-suit, and deliberately ripped it open.\n\nThe doomed man's last scream rang in their helmets as the water poured\ninto his suit. They saw him writhe and struggle desperately in the\nremorseless grip which held him. The two huge eyes of the cuttlefish\nsurveyed his death throes minutely; watched his agonized struggles\ngradually weaken; watched his legs and arms relax, his head sink\nlower.... And then the tentacle let a lifeless body float to the\nfloor.\n\nJennerby, a huge engineer, went completely mad. \"I'll get him, the\ndevil!\" he yelled, and before Keith could command him to stay back,\nhad flung himself onto the giant king.\n\nDeath came as a mere matter of course. Without apparent effort, the\nmonarch ripped off Jennerby's helmet and sent him spinning back. The\nman's body writhed and shuddered, and in a moment another stark white\nface showed where death had struck....\n\nTrembling, sick at heart, the commander yet had to think of his men.\n\"For God's sake,\" he cautioned them, \"keep back. Don't try to fight\nnow; we've got to wait our chance! Steady. Steady....\"\n\nThe king's deliberate tentacle again began its slow weaving. It was\nchoosing another victim. And this time it darted straight out at Keith\nWells and gripped him with a mighty clutch about the waist.\n\nThe commander did not cry out. As he was brought close to the staring\neyes, and felt their sinister gaze run over him, it flashed through\nhim for some obscure reason that the monster knew him for what he was,\nthe leader, from the tiny bars on each shoulder of his sea-suit.... He\nwaited for the tentacles to rip it open.\n\nBut they did not. Instead, the creature turned and swiftly swam with\nhim out through the entrance hole.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey went to the left in the corridor, further into the heart of the\nbuilding. The bluish light became stronger. As Keith twisted in the\ngiant monarch's grip he glimpsed the other octopus following with the\ntwo dead men. He saved his strength knowing it was hopeless just then\nto try and struggle free.\n\nQuick as was his passage, he noticed that the walls of the corridor\nwere covered with intricate designs, in bas-relief, and colored. He\npassed row after row of mural paintings of octopi in various\nactivities, and guessed that they represented the race's history. One\nwas obviously a scene of battle, with a tentacled army locked in\ncombat with another strange horde of fishlike creatures; a second\nshowed the construction of the queer mound-buildings on the sea-floor,\nwith scores of monsters hauling great chunks of material into place,\nand another pictured the huge audience chamber, with a gold-banded\nking motionless on his throne.\n\nAs the king drew him rapidly along, he had a glimpse through a\ncircular doorway of a large room, inside which were clustered the\nblack shapes of thousands of baby octopi, tended by what were\nevidently nurses. Other such rooms were passed, and the young\ncommander's brain whirled as he tried to measure the size and progress\nof this undersea civilization. Perhaps the race of octopi was growing,\nreaching out; needed new room to colonize. That would explain why\ntheir submarine had been sent through the tunnel....\n\nA voice sounded in his ears:\n\n\"Keith? Are you all right?\" It was Graham, calling from the cell\nbehind.\n\n\"So far,\" Wells assured him. \"I'll keep in touch, and let you know\nwhat happens.\"\n\nAt that moment, his captor carried him into a large chamber at the end\nof the corridor. He looked around, and decided it was a laboratory. He\nbeheld strange instruments, anatomical charts of octopi on the walls\nand, in one corner, a small jar of glass, in which a dull flame was\nburning. Many-shaped keen-bladed knives lay on various low tables, and\nthin, wicked-looking prongs and pincers.\n\n\"I'm in their experimental laboratory, Graham,\" Wells spoke into the\nmouthpiece of his tiny radio. And then his roving eyes saw something\nthat made him audibly gasp.\n\n\"What's the matter, Keith?\" came the first officer's anxious voice.\n\nAfter a moment the commander answered. \"It's--it's a pile of human\nbodies. The bodies of those fishermen. They--they've been\nexperimenting on them....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWas he, too, Wells wondered, to be experimented on? The sight of that\nstacked pile of bodies chilled him with horror. He kept his eyes from\nthem, till the octopus with the golden bands swung him through a\nhinged door in the farther wall.\n\nHe found himself in a side room, smaller than the outer chamber, the\nwhole center of which was occupied by a huge glass bell jar, some\nthirty feet in diameter. Inside it was much strange-looking apparatus\non tables, and trays of operating instruments--knives like those in\nthe outer room, and the same thin prongs. The great jar was empty of\nwater, and on one side was an entrance port.\n\nThe king tossed Keith into a corner and quickly donned a metal-scaled\nwater-suit. When he had it all on, and the glass body-container\nfastened into place, he picked up his captive again and advanced\nthrough the bell jar's entrance port into a small water chamber. A\nmoment later Wells felt his body grow heavy as the water of the\ncompartment ran out, and then there was a click and he found himself\ninside the jar, still held in the merciless grip of a tentacle.\n\nHe twisted around to find the cold eyes of the octopus staring at him\nonly a foot away. And as he wondered what was going to happen next,\nthe king unfastened the glass face-shield of the commander's sea-suit\nwith a quick flip of the tip of a tentacle.\n\nKeith's arms were pinned to his sides; he could not move to try to\nrefasten the face-shield. Fearful, he held his breath; held it until\nhis face was purple and his lungs were near to bursting. But at last\nthe limit was reached, and with a great wrench he sucked in a full\nbreath.\n\nIt was clean, fresh air!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe air was like a breath of his own world brought down to this cold\nrealm of octopi. Once he had caught up with his breathing it poured\nnew life into his limbs, jaded from the artificial air of the\nsea-suit. Keith felt his muscles respond, felt his whole body glow\nwith new strength and life. Twelve inches away the king was watching\nhis every reaction closely through the huge helmet of glass. The\nthought passed through the commander's mind that he was not only king,\nbut chief scientist of this strange water civilization.\n\nThen, while his lungs swallowed hungrily the good, fresh air, several\ntentacles began to feel around him in an attempt to unfasten the rest\nof his sea-suit.\n\nWells blanched at the sudden realization of how helpless he would be\nif the suit were taken from him. He would then not only be a prisoner\nof the octopi, but a prisoner of the glass jar, unable ever to leave\nit, and more than ever at the mercy of his captor's least whim. Not\nthat he had any delusion that he would live long in any case: it was\njust the simple strong instinct of self-preservation that made him\ngrab at every chance for life.\n\nThis thought flashed through his mind, even while the octopus was\nfumbling with the catches of his suit. And along with it was born a\ndesperate plan of escape. He was in his own element, air; the octopus\nout of his. If he could crack the glass of the king's helmet, and let\nthe water out and air in!... The glass was only twelve inches away.\n\nThe commander stopped his resistance, and at the same time felt about\nwith his legs until he had them well braced against a lower tentacle.\nHe pushed gently, and came a few inches nearer the glass; a little\nmore. Then, with a quick, strong jerk of his body he crashed the steel\nframe of his helmet square against the cuttlefish's sheathing of\nglass.\n\nThe creature was taken wholly by surprise. Tentacles whipped out to\ntear the rash human quickly away--but not before Keith had pounded\nagain, and heard the splinter of smashed glass! He had jabbed a hole\nin the glass body-piece, and already the life-giving water was pouring\nout!\n\nPanic seized the king, and he became a nightmare of tortured\ntentacles. Wells was flung wildly away and fetched up against the side\nof the jar with a crash that for a second stunned him. More and more\nwater poured from the octopus' suit, and air at once rushed in to take\nits place. The creature's great eyes became filmy, while the revolting\nspidery body slewed here and there across the jar, all the time\nwhipping and thrashing at the strangling air. Keith scurried from side\nto side, trying to keep out of reach of the crazy, writhing tentacles.\nOnce a glancing blow knocked him flat, but the monster was altogether\nunconscious of him and he got away.\n\nLittle by little the terrific whipping and coiling of the tentacles\nquieted down. The drowning king lay in one place now; its loathsome\nred body, no longer protected by glass, turned bluish. Keith thrilled\nwith elation at his victory.\n\nAnd then, for the first time, he noticed that there was a full three\ninches of water on the floor--far too much to spill from the king's\nsuit. A quick look around showed him where it came from. There was a\nlong crack in the side of the glass jar, at the place where he had\nbeen crashed against it--and water was pouring in!\n\nKeith flung himself against the crack, jammed his arm into the\nbroadest part of the leak. But still the water rushed in. The octopus\nwas in its death throes, weakening steadily--but just as steadily the\nwater poured in and rose up the sides of its body. In a flash Wells\nsaw that the liquid would win the race to cover it and allow the\nmonster to resume breathing.\n\n\"Oh, damn it!\" he cursed fervently. \"Now I've got to run for it!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe stumbled to the port, snapping shut his face-shield as he went. In\na moment he had solved the working of the mechanism and was in the\nwater chamber, then outside in the room itself. Fortunately his\nsea-suit was unhurt. He thanked heaven for that as he tore away a\nboardlike piece of apparatus and jammed it over the leak in the jar.\n\nKeith paused a moment to plan. The king of the octopi was still\nwrithing in ever weakening struggles, but the water was halfway up his\nbody. \"It'll cover him soon,\" thought the commander, \"and then it's a\nquestion how long it'll take him to come to. I've got to move\nfast--slip out into the corridor and run the gauntlet back to the\nmen.\" His eyes rested on a large knife, and he appropriated it, since\nhe saw nothing else he might use.\n\nFor the first time since the beginning of the fight he answered the\nquestions and exclamations that had constantly sounded in his ears\nfrom the distant crew. Tersely he told them what had happened, and of\nthe gauntlet he had to run.\n\n\"Make ready for a dash to the _NX-1_,\" he finished. \"It's now or\nnever. Wait three minutes for me, and if I don't make it, go ahead\nanyway. Remember--three minutes. This is an order. So long, fellows!\"\n\nHe shut his ears to the bedlam of comment that followed. His knife\nready, he took a few steps to the door and pushed out--right into the\ntentacles of a waiting octopus.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis knife was useless. While locked motionless by three arms of his\ncaptor, another streaked out and wrenched it from his hand. Once again\nKeith was absolutely helpless.\n\nGreat confusion resulted in the laboratory. The commander heard no\nsound, but the guard must have called, for five more octopi darted\nrapidly out of an adjoining room. Their tentacles writhing in great\nexcitement, they swam past and into the inner chamber to the rescue of\ntheir nearly drowned king.\n\nThe devil-fish that held Wells almost crushed him to death in its\nexcitement. It was obviously undecided what to do; but finally it sped\nhim down the passageway and cast him back inside the cell with his\nmen. Then it quickly retreated.\n\nThe commander staggered to his feet and faced Graham and the others.\n\"A miracle!\" he gasped; \"I'll tell you later. But now we've got to\nmake our break. The king's out, and we've got to get away before they\nbring him to. There's nothing to do but rush the door. It means sure\ndeath for half of us, and probably for all--but God help us if the\nking catches us!\"\n\nHe paused and surveyed them keenly. \"Everybody with me?\" he asked. And\nnot one man held back his answer.\n\nWells smiled a little. \"Good!\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were twelve men and two officers. There were thousands of\noctopi. On the face of it, their chances seemed hopeless. Not for a\nsecond did Keith count on getting many men to the _NX-1._ But he knew\nwhere the submarine was, and he had to try.\n\nTersely he gave them final instructions.\n\n\"This corridor leads to the main entrance. That is, to the\nright--understand? Then straight down the street outside, to the left,\nis the square where they towed the _NX-1._ I'd say it was a hundred\nyards.\n\n\"There's one guard outside. Graham, you and half the men to the right\nof the door. I'll take the rest to the left. Our only chance is to try\nand destroy the octopus' eyes.\"\n\nHis mind cast about desperately for some form of weapon. The only\ndetachable thing on their sea-suits was the small helmet-light, a\nthing, Keith told himself, without possible offensive use. Still, the\nbeams would enable them to more clearly see their path and keep\ntogether, so he ordered them in hand.\n\nThe men were grouped and alert. The moment had come.\n\n\"Remember,\" he said, \"--its eyes. Then stick together and run like\nhell. All right--good luck--and let's go!\"\n\nAwkwardly, stumbling clumsily in the retarding water, the small group\nsurged through the door. Immediately a black shape pounced upon them\nfrom the clustered shadows--the guarding octopus.\n\nIts tentacles seemed to be everywhere. In seconds five men were\nclutched in its awful grip, their fists rising and falling impotently\nas the hideous arms constricted and crushed them inward. Keith, free\nof the clasp, yelled: \"The eyes! The eyes! Put out its eyes!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor answer, a yellow arm clutching a helmet-light broke through the\ngrotesquely milling mass and struck at the cuttlefish's great pools of\neyes. It missed, but the switch flicked on, and there stabbed through\nthe gloom a broad, glaringly white ray.\n\nIts effect was astounding. The beam smote the octopus squarely in its\nhuge eyes, and immediately the creature shuddered; writhed with pain.\nThe tentacles released the men--and the monster fled back into the\nprotecting shadows!\n\nA shout from the men roared in the commander's earphones. \"They can't\nstand the light!\" he cried. \"Thank God! Beams on, everyone! Flash 'em\nin their eyes! Forward!\"\n\nFourteen shafts of eye-dazzling light forked through the corridor.\nThe tiny company, beating their path with criss-crossing shafts of\nwhite, forged ahead. They thrashed the shadows with their beams,\nprobing each inch of water--clearing their way even as a tank hoses\nmachine-gun bullets before its clumsy body. Their former slender\nchance grew; they filled with hope.\n\nAnother swarm of devil-fish, long arms whipping before them, raced\nfrom branching corridors and bore down on the company of humans. The\nmen were ready, and fourteen tongues of white met them squarely. They\nfaltered; the weight of their fellows behind shoved them on; but the\nrays steadied, and the front row of octopi broke in panic. The others\nat once followed in wild retreat.\n\n\"Keep together, men!\" Keith ordered sharply. \"One beam to each\noctopus--straight in its eyes till it retreats! Forward!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey pressed on. The octopi, with eyes used only to the soft blue glow\nof the cavern, could not stand against the brilliant rays. Keith\nleading, the _NX-1's_ crew stumbled out into the street.\n\nThey faltered a moment when they saw each entrance hole of the\nmound-buildings shooting out streams of octopi. Hundreds were in sight\nalready. The whole city was evidently alarmed. Wells at once formed\nhis men in a circle, so their beams would guard them on every side and\nabove. Apparently the octopi could not approach within thirty feet of\nthem, and even at that distance they turned and fled, writhing with\npain, whenever a shaft of light struck full in their eyes.\n\n\"The square's just ahead!\" the commander roared. \"One last rush, now,\nand we'll reach the submarine! Stick close; keep your arms locked; and\nwatch out above!\"\n\nThe circle of men narrowed. The rays gave their tiny cluster the\nappearance of a monster even more fantastic than those moiling around\nthem--a monster with long straight tentacles of glaring white. They\nstumbled forward through the magically parting ranks of black octopi.\nThe beams kept the creatures back; they were helpless before them.\n\nFoot by foot under the inverted bowl of threshing tentacles the\n_NX-1's_ crew lumbered ahead. The street at last ceased; the wide\nsquare opened before them.\n\n\"We're here!\" Wells yelled exultantly. \"This is the--\"\n\nHis voice fell into abrupt silence. He stared around the square, and\nhis heart went cold indeed. They had reached the right place, but it\nwas empty.\n\nThe _NX-1_ was not there!\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n_Cook, the Navigator_\n\nThrough all these hours, one man had remained on the _NX-1_, and that\nman was, to put it mildly, scared to death.\n\nCook Angus McKegnie had been nearest the connecting ladder when Keith\nWells roared out the command to retreat above, and his desire to\nregain a place of safety was so earnest that he made the control room\nin record time. At once he had felt the tingle of the paralyzing ray.\nStruck by a horrible thought, he ventured to peer down the ladder--and\ngroaned to see the figures of his comrades, all lying limply on the\ndeck. His portly frame quivered like jelly as realization came to him\nthat he was the only one who had escaped the ray.\n\nHeroic ideas of saving the submarine, of rescuing the men below,\nflashed wildly through his head. But only for a moment. On second\nthought, he felt he ought to hide. So, in the tomblike silence that\nhad fallen, the two-hundred-and-twenty-pound McKegnie wormed a way\nbehind an instrument panel, effecting the journey by vigorous shoves\nof his stomach. It was minutes later that he first noticed that some\nsharp jutting object was jutting deep into his ample paunch, but he\ncould do nothing to remedy it. He was hidden, anyway, and he was going\nto stay hidden!\n\nThe cook felt the _NX-1_ being towed forward. Then, after a dreadful\nwait, he heard queer noises down below, and was positive the exit\nports had opened. The snakelike slithering and shuffling which\nfollowed would mean that the enemy was inside the _NX-1._ The thought\nbrought St. Vitus' dance to his limbs, and, try as he might, he\ncouldn't still them. Then again the ports opened, the gloomy silence\nreturned, and Angus McKegnie was alone with his reflections.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter the first hour he gave voice to them in one simple, bitter\nsentence. \"Just why the hell,\" he muttered, \"did I ever join the\nNavy?\" The silence offered no reply, and McKegnie, desperate from his\ncramped position, ventured to poke his head around the instrument\npanel. The faint emergency lights showed the control room to be empty.\nHe decided to come out, and did so, worming his way back with great\ndifficulty.\n\nOnce out, the first thing his eyes fell on was the teleview screen.\nNow the cook had never seen one of the octopi, and the screen showed\nhundreds of monsters clustering around the _NX-1._ So with unusual\npromptness he acted, jamming himself once again into his hiding place.\nMaybe, he thought, they had some way in which they could see into the\ncontrol room and discover him!\n\nHours passed. The cook was sopping with sweat. Finally his thoughts\nemerged into words.\n\n\"I got to get out of here!\" he said intensely. \"I _got_ to! And I got\nto run this submarine!\"\n\nThe sound of his voice somehow emboldened him. Once more he backed out\nof his cranny, and with cautious, trembling steps explored the control\nroom. He kept his eyes from the teleview, though it had a terrible\nfascination for him, and surveyed the _NX-1's_ array of control\ninstruments. The prospective navigator groaned at the sight.\n\nThere were dozens of mysterious wheels, jutting from every possible\nangle, squads of black and red-handled levers, whole armies of queer\nlittle stud-buttons and dials. His knowledge of cooking helped him not\nat all in the presence of that maze of devices. Timidly he touched one\nof the levers, but immediately snatched his hand away as if afraid it\nwould bite. His boldly announced purpose of running the craft went\nglimmering.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAn accidental glimpse of the monsters in the teleview suddenly decided\nhim that he needed a weapon. He hunted frantically through the lockers\nand found three service revolvers, which he fastened at his waist,\nadding his own carving knife to the arsenal. But he didn't feel much\nbetter. Then, remembering for the first time his sea-suit radio, he\nyelled: \"Mr. Wells! Mr. Wells! Oh, Mr. Wells, where are you? Can you\nhear me?\" There was, of course, no answer.\n\nHe tried to bring his muddled thoughts and fears to order. \"I got to\nrun this thing,\" he said doggedly. \"_Got_ to! Now, let's see: what the\nhell's this thing for?... What the--\"\n\nHe broke off short, and his eyes went wide. He had heard a noise!\n\nYes--there it was again! The same peculiar scraping at one of the exit\nports! He glanced fearfully at the teleview. \"Oh, Lord!\" he yelped.\n\"They're comin' in to get me!\"\n\nHe started to dive back behind the instrument panel, but stopped, drew\ntwo guns, and in an agonized muddle trotted back and forth for a\nmoment, waving them. Another look at the screen showed that an exit\nport was open, admitting two metal-scaled octopi. McKegnie couldn't\nstand it any longer: he wedged himself behind his panel again. Soon\nsounds of the metal tentacles on the deck below told him that one of\nthe creatures was coming up the ramp--then slithering into the control\nroom itself. The cook was a lather of cold perspiration.\n\nFor a few minutes there was silence. The octopus was apparently\nsurveying this new part of the submarine. Then, without warning, the\ntip of a metal-scaled tentacle felt around the panel and crept,\nexploring, up Angus McKegnie's leg--which leg was again suddenly\nafflicted with St. Vitus' dance. The tentacles coiled, pulled\nhard--and the cook with a yowl was yanked out into the room.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDangling upside down, high in the air, he submitted to the fishy stare\nof the great eyes under the sheathing of glass. But soon he started to\nsquirm, and his violent contortions brought a rush of blood to his\nhead, making him quite dizzy. It was while he was in that state that\nthings started to happen.\n\nFirst, a great roar rolled through the _NX-1_, and McKegnie found\nhimself flat on the floor with his breath knocked out. Then, while\nthis was registering on his mind, he discovered himself the center of\na madly milling set of tentacles, and instinctively scrambled out of\nthe way. From a distance he saw that the tentacles belonged to the\noctopus that had held him, and that their coilings and threshings were\ngradually dying down, until only a quiver ran through them from time\nto time. While McKegnie was trying to figure this all out he noticed\nthat the monster's glass sheeting was shattered, that it lay in a pool\nof water, and that the odor of burnt powder was in the air. Looking\ndown he found that he had a gun in his hand. A thin wisp of smoke was\ncurling from the barrel.\n\n\"Gee whiz!\" he ejaculated. \"Gee _whiz_!\"\n\nAs he stood there recovering from his surprise, he heard the other\noctopus crawling up the connecting ramp, coming to see what had\nbefallen its fellow. Preceded by two trembling guns, McKegnie tiptoed\nto the ramp and peered down.\n\nFrom the darkness he saw another complicated mass of metal tentacles\nand glass advancing up towards him. Fear smote the cook, and almost\nwithout volition be pointed his guns and pulled the triggers. As\nbefore, a bullet crashed into the great dome of glass, and he watched\na short but terrible death struggle. He had, by himself, slain two\noctopi!\n\nA tremendous elation filled McKegnie--until it occurred to him that\nhis shots might have been heard outside. At once he ran and looked at\nthe teleview view screen, and what he saw on its silver surface took\nall the triumph abruptly out of him. The octopi outside were darting\nabout with alarming activity; a whole cluster of them was centered at\nthe exit port, and, even as the cook stared, the preliminary sounds of\nopening it came to his ears.\n\n\"Now I _got_ to run this ship!\" he groaned.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe peered at the mass of levers and wheels, put out a hand, closed his\neyes, hesitated, and pulled one of them back. Nothing happened.\n\nHe tried another. The noise below grew, but still the _NX-1_ remained\nmotionless. Desperate, the cook jerked several other levers. The whine\nof electric motors surged through the silence; the submarine shuddered\nand slewed off to the right, as if trying to dig into the sea-floor.\n\n\"I got it started!\" he cried. He did something else. The _NX-1_ stuck\nher bow dizzily up and sped into the misty-blue realm above in a\ngrand, sweeping circle. The sea-floor with its mound-buildings and\nswarming octopi fell away behind with a rush.\n\n\"There!\" muttered the triumphant cook. \"But--how did I do it?\"\n\nThe submarine was rising like a sky-rocket. McKegnie remembered\nsuddenly that Wells had said the cavern was only a few miles high; he\nmust now be very near the top. He held his breath while he pushed a\nlikely looking lever the other way.\n\nHe was lucky. The _NX-1_ capered like a two-year-old, kicked up her\nstern and bolted eagerly for the depths once more. Again the floor of\nthe cavern rushed up at him, again he pulled the potent lever back,\nand again the submarine meteored upward.\n\nThis procedure went on for some time. McKegnie was only running an\nelevator. Was he doomed to dash up and down between floor and ceiling\nforever? He gave forth pints of sweat, now and then groaning as the\nsubmarine grazed horribly close to top or bottom. The dead octopus at\nhis feet slithered limply around on the crazy-angling deck.\n\n\"I can't keep this up forever!\" the cook said peevishly. \"Now, what\nthe hell's this thing for?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe turned it, and the _NX-1_ tilted in one of her dives and raced\nforward, midway between ceiling and floor. Her navigator relaxed\nslightly. He had found the major controls; at least he had been able\nto stop his dizzy game of plunging up and down. Then, just as he was\nbeginning to wonder where he could go, a large red spot glowed at the\nedge of the location chart.\n\n\"Oh, Lord!\" he cried. \"That's the other submarine--an' it's comin'\nafter me!\"\n\nEvidently it was, for the red spot rapidly approached the green one.\nThe paralyzing ray tingled, and a moment later the enemy's huge bulk\nloomed on the teleview screen, a band of violet light spearing from\none of her jutting knobs.\n\nFrantically McKegnie juggled his levers, and then it was that the\n_NX-1_ really showed what was in her. She emulated, on a grand scale,\na bucking bronco: she stood almost on her nose, and threatened to\ndescribe somersaults; she tried it the other way, on her stern; she\nrolled dizzily; she all but looped the loop, and went staggering\naround the cavern in great erratic bounds that must have made the\noctopi think she was in the hands of a mad-man--which she practically\nwas. Her designer would have had heart failure.\n\nIn the teleview screen the frantic McKegnie would see the octopi\nsubmarine rush erratically by with a flash of its violet heat ray; the\nlocation chart showed the red spot zigzagging drunkenly around the\ngreen one. Each boat made occasional short, crazy darts at the other;\nsometimes they would stand approximately still. It was a riotous game\nof tag, and McKegnie knew too well that he was \"it.\"\n\nDuring one brief pause the anguished cook found himself groaning\naloud: \"Oh, Mr. Wells, where are you? I can't keep this up! I can't! I\ncan't!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were still several important-looking controls that were\nmysteries to him. But what if he should pull one and open all the exit\nports? He shuddered at the thought.\n\nThings had become nightmarish. The ship was pitted scores of places by\nthe heat ray. The control room had grown stifling. McKegnie was losing\npounds of flesh, and literally stood in a pool of his own\nperspiration. The octopi craft kept doggedly after the _NX-1_, no\nmatter how often and effectually the sweating cook's reckless hands\nprevented her getting the heat ray home.\n\nFor a long time the two ships continued to race up and down. The\n_NX-1_ would plunge, pirouette around the other, and scamper away\ntowards the ceiling as if enjoying it all hugely, abruptly to forsake\nher course and come zooming down once more. She would weave in romping\ncircles and seem to go utterly crazy as her jumbled navigator pulled\nhis levers and turned his wheels in a frantic effort to get somewhere.\n\nTo get somewhere! Yes--but where?\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Wells, where are you?\" the harried cook would bleat at\nintervals.\n\nOr, plaintively: \"Now, what the hell's _this_ thing for?\"\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n_At Bay_\n\nFourteen humans stood at bay on the cold sea-floor, dazed by the\nruthless stroke of ill-luck which had taken the _NX-1_ from where they\nhad left it.\n\n\"It's gone,\" whispered Graham over and over in a hopeless tone. Keith\ntried to pull himself together. He had to think of his men.\n\nIn a second, his whole plan, which had seemed to be approaching\nsuccess so rapidly, was smashed by the disappearance of the submarine.\nMechanically he kept his helmet-light playing into the ever-thickening\neyes and tentacles around him, while he scanned the sea-floor nearby.\nIt was filling more closely than ever with the black, writhing forms\nof the cuttlefish. The rays still held them back, but their great bulk\nloomed over the small party of humans like a sinister storm cloud.\nSoon, in their overwhelming mass, they would crush down, and the\nsubmarine's crew be conquered by sheer force of numbers.\n\n\"Look!\" Keith cried. \"There's where she was lying!\"\n\nHe pointed out on the floor of the square a deep groove, obviously\nmade by the hull of the _NX-1_. Its length and jaggedness seemed to\ndenote that the submarine had tried to bore into the bed of the cavern\nitself. Wells was mystified. If the octopi-ship had towed her away,\nshe would certainly not have gouged that deep scar on the sea\nbottom....\n\nBut he dismissed the strange disappearance from his mind. He had to\nwork out a plan of action.\n\n\"Keep together, men, and follow that scar!\" he ordered tersely.\n\"There's a chance that the _NX-1's_ somewhere further along!\"\n\nIt was a futile hope, he knew--but there was nothing else. The tiny\ngroup, centered in the inverted bowl of black, writhing tentacles,\nlumbered onward.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen the octopi struck with another weapon, in an effort to dull the\nspearing beams of white. Here and there from the mass of black an even\nblacker cloud began to emerge. It quickly settled over the whole\nscene, pervading it with a pitchy, clinging darkness that obscured\neach man from his neighbor.\n\n\"Ink!\" cried one of them. It was sepia from the cuttlefish's ink\nsacs--the weapon with which these monsters of the underseas blind and\nconfuse their victims.\n\n\"Faster!\" the commander roared in answer. \"And for heaven's sake, keep\ntogether!\"\n\nThey huddled closer. Under the protecting cloud of ink the mass of\noctopi pressed nearer. The struggle became fantastic, unreal, as the\nbrilliant beams of white bored through the utter blackness searching\nfor eyes which the men knew were there, yet could not see until their\nrays chanced upon them. Snaky shadows milled horribly close to the\nlittle group of bulging yellow figures. Blacker and blacker grew the\nwater; they could not always see the monsters as they drove them back\non each side. Now and then a bold tentacle actually touched one of\nthem for a moment before its owner was thrust, blinded, away.\n\nSuddenly the dark cloud cleared a little as the fight moved into an\nunseen current. Their range of vision lengthened to ten or twelve\nfeet; they could dimly sense the looming mass of cuttlefish: and it\nwas less often that one of the monsters darted forward, daring the\nrays of white, and became altogether visible. When this did happen,\nhalf a dozen dazzling beams converged on the octopus' eyes and drove\nit back in writhing agony.\n\nThe men were the hub of a grotesque cartwheel, whose spokes were\ninter-crossing rays of white. They still forged onward along the\ngroove, but moved more slowly now, and Keith Wells, tired to death,\nrealized the combat could not go on much longer. Their advance was\nuseless; a mere jest. The _NX-1_ had vanished. It would only be a\nquestion of time before their batteries gave out, or the swarms of\noctopi crushed in on the struggling crew. Their overwhelming numbers\nwould tell in the end.... The men were silent, except for the\noccasional gasps which came from their laboring lungs.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd then the king of the octopi appeared.\n\nKeith had been wondering, in the aching turmoil that was his brain,\nwhere the gold-banded monarch was. He knew the monster had been\nrescued, and he dreaded coming face to face once more with that huge\nform. Now, armlets of glittering yellow suddenly flashed in the thick\nof the besieging tentacles, and two great evil eyes glared for a\nsecond at Keith Wells. The commander flung a burst of light at them\nand laughed crazily as the monster scurried back. For a few moments\nthe king was not visible.\n\n\"Well, fellows,\" Wells said, \"it won't be long now. His Majesty's back\non the field.\" He grinned a little through his weary face. \"I wonder\nwhat he'll hatch up to combat our helmet-lights? Watch close: he's\ndamn clever!\"\n\nThe commander did not have long to wonder. The vague wall of tentacles\nbegan retreating deeper into the ink. Keith could not imagine the\nreason for it, but held himself taut and ready. His men, likewise\nnoting the move, unconsciously grouped closer, waiting tensely for\nthey knew not what.\n\nThe king of the octopi had indeed hatched a plan of attack. After a\nmoment the mass of creatures again became slowly visible, but this\ntime when the rays shot out they did not hold them back. Could\nnot--for their eyes were not visible.\n\n\"My God!\" Wells cried. \"They're coming backwards!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was so. The octopi--no doubt under their ruler's orders--had turned\nthemselves around, and now, with eyes directly away from the dazzling\nshafts of white, were closing slowly in on the humans from all sides.\nThe helmet-lights were useless. They could not reach the creatures'\neyes.\n\nTentacles coiling, whipping, interweaving, the wall of flesh pressed\nin. Death stared the helpless crew of the _NX-1_ in the face. First\nOfficer Graham shrugged his shoulders and said tiredly:\n\n\"Well, I guess it's all over.... Unless,\" he added with a feeble\nsmile, \"somebody figures a way to melt us through the sea-floor....\"\n\nKeith Wells' face suddenly lit up with an idea. He swung around and\nroared:\n\n\"The hell it's over! We can go _up_!\"\n\nHis crew understood at once. \"What fools we--\" Graham began, but Keith\ncut him short.\n\n\"Listen,\" he rapped quickly. \"Jam together in one bunch and lock arms\ntight. When I give the word, flood your suits with air. We'll go up\nlike comets; crash right through the devils.... Hurry!... All ready?\"\n\nHe saw that they were. \"Then, together--go!\" he commanded.\n\nAs one man the crew adjusted their air-controls, bulging the sea-suits\nwith air. Their weighted feet left the cavern floor at once, and,\nlocked tightly together, the whole fourteen of them shot like a bullet\nto the living ceiling of unsuspecting cuttlefish above.\n\nThey hit with a terrific crash. Keith was momentarily stunned by the\nforce of impact. He felt himself torn away from his men, felt a dozen\ntentacles snake over him, and mechanically stabbed out with his\nhelmet-light. For a moment he was held; then the air and his light\npulled him through, and he broke out through the top.\n\nIn his rocketing upward progress the extra oxygen rapidly cleared his\nmind. Glancing below he saw a great, dark, many-fingered cloud\ndropping rapidly away, and was glad to know that the octopi could not\nfollow him into the lesser pressures above without their suits. Over\nthe dark cloud he glimpsed a few scattered pin-points of light--the\nhelmet-beams of the other men. They were rising as swiftly as he.\n\n\"Thank God!\" he murmured reverently. \"We broke through! We broke\nthrough!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n_The Return of the Wanderer_\n\nWells watched the several helmet-lights shooting upwards and wondered\nif they represented all the men that had got safely through the net of\ntentacles. Remembering the rocky ceiling they were rapidly\napproaching, he ordered the others to reduce speed by discharging air\nfrom their sea-suits. He received no articulate answer.\n\nAlthough he cut down the rush of his own progress, it was with a jar\nthat he bounded into the top of the cavern. As he dangled there, he\nbeheld four light beams hurtling upward; his earphones registered\ncrash after crash: and then he saw the beams go spinning down into the\ngloom again, weaving and crossing fantastically, the shock having\njerked them from their owner's hands. Keith had lost his own\nhelmet-light below, but peering around he could make out a few vague\nforms, bumping and twisting in the current.\n\n\"Graham!\" the commander called. \"Graham, you there?\" After a moment\nhis first officer's voice came thickly back.\n\n\"Yes--here. A bit groggy. That crash....\" Wells swam clumsily towards\nhim.\n\n\"I guess only a few of us broke through,\" the commander said slowly.\nAs the two officers hung at the roof, swinging grotesquely, one by one\nthe other men came to their senses and reported their presence in the\nradiophone. Keith ordered them to cluster around him, and soon eight\nweird figures had grouped nearby. After a while they located two\nothers, which brought their total to ten men and two officers. They\nlooked a long time, but could not find any more. Two were gone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDeep silence fell over the tiny group. The dark mass of the rocky\nceiling scraped their helmets; below, the bluish waters tapered into a\nthick gloom, hiding, miles beneath, the mound-buildings and swarming\noctopi.\n\nOne of the men spoke. His words were audible to everyone, and they\nvoiced the thought in every brain:\n\n\"What're we going to do now?\"\n\nKeith had no answer. They had escaped the immediate danger, but it was\nonly a temporary respite. The commander knew it was hopeless to try\nand locate the tunnel leading to the outer sea, for they were very\ntired, and in their clumsy suits they would be able to swim only a few\nrods. Their helmet-lights were gone; they had played their last card.\n\n\"They're goin' to find us after a while,\" the pessimistic voice\ncontinued. \"They'll send that submarine of theirs after us--or maybe\nthey'll come up in their metal suits....\"\n\n\"Well,\" Keith replied with forced cheerfulness, \"then we'll have to\nfight 'em off.\"\n\n\"Why not rip our suits an' end it now--\" began another, but Graham's\nvoice cut in sharply.\n\n\"Quiet!\" he said. \"I heard something!\"\n\nThe men stilled abruptly. In tense silence their ears strained at the\nheadphones. Wells asked: \"What did you hear?\"\n\n\"Wait!\" Graham interrupted, listening intently. \"There it is again!\nListen! Can't you hear it? Why, it sounded like--like--\"\n\nKeith concentrated his whole mind on listening, but could catch\nnothing at all. He was just about to give up when he caught a faint,\njumbled murmur--the murmur of a human voice.\n\n\"My God!\" he whispered. The voice, little by little, grew, and Wells\ncould distinguish words. They formed into a complete sentence. Keith\nheard it plainly. It was:\n\n\"Now, what the hell's this thing for?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnmistakably, it was the voice of Cook Angus McKegnie, whom they all\nhad thought dead.\n\nAmazed, the men of the crew started to jabber. \"Quiet!\" Wells ordered\nsharply. He listened again. McKegnie's voice was growing quickly and\nsteadily louder.\n\n\"McKegnie!\" the commander cried excitedly. \"McKegnie, can you hear\nme?\" There was no answer. Patiently Wells waited a minute, every\nsecond of which increased the volume of his long-lost cook's\nbewildered tones. Again he tried.\n\n\"McKegnie! Can you hear me? This is Commander Wells. McKegnie!\"\n\nThe cook's stammering voice came back:\n\n\"Why--why--is that you, Mr. Wells? Did I hear you, Mr. Wells?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" Keith shouted impatiently. \"This is Commander Wells! For\nheaven's sake, McKegnie, where are you?\"\n\n\"I don't know, sir!\" the cook responded. \"Where are you?\"\n\nKeith was for the moment perplexed. \"But--but, are you a prisoner?\" he\nquestioned. And he could have sworn he heard a distinct note of pride\nas the invisible McKegnie replied: \"Oh, no, sir! Not yet! These devils\nbeen tryin' their best to get me, but they couldn't! No, sir!\"\n\nWells became more and more puzzled. \"Then--but--you're not running the\n_NX-1_, are you?\"\n\nMcKegnie's voice was much louder now, and growing every second. The\nnote of pride persisted. \"Of course, sir!\" he confirmed. \"It was kind\nof hard at first, with these octopises botherin' me, but I got onto it\npretty quick. That octopis ship chased me with them heat rays for a\nlong time, but I ain't seen them lately. I guess I kinda tired them\nout.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis last words grew louder with a rush, and from the dark depths\nbeneath a long shape suddenly appeared, hurtling up at the group of\nastounded men in a zoom that bade fair to take it straight through the\nceiling. It was the _NX-1_.\n\n\"Dive, man, dive!\" Keith yelled. \"Cook, pull that black-handled lever\ntowards you! Yank it back! Yank it back! Quick!\" He sighed with relief\nas he saw his madly-driven submarine pause, whip its nose downward,\nand crash back for the depths from which it had come.\n\nThe commander spoke rapidly. \"McKegnie, listen: Leave the black lever\nhalfway, so you'll level out. Straighten your helm. We're only a\nlittle above you; come round in a circle till I tell you to stop.\"\n\nThe _NX-1_ came out of her dive, and, as the cook evidently shoved her\nhelm over, went skirting around in a wide, drunken circle, some\nthousand feet below her regular crew.\n\n\"All right!\" Keith shouted. The fear that the octopi submarine would\ndart back before he could get aboard his ship was looming in his mind.\n\"You're at the helm, Cook; there's a wheel right over your head. Spin\nit around--oh, my God, there you go again!\" He groaned while the\n_NX-1_ went swooping off on a repetition of her crazy circle.\n\n\"Sorry, sir,\" the culinary navigator said thickly. \"I guess I got the\nwrong thing.\"\n\n\"Now!\" Wells roared. \"Spin that wheel above your head.... That's\nright--right--there! Don't touch a thing, Cook! We're coming down.\"\n\nThe submarine had paused directly beneath them, listing slightly to\nport. Then began the cautious business of the descent. Under Wells'\nrapid orders the men linked arms again and discharged more air from\ntheir sea-suits. Slowly, thin chains of bubbles rising behind them,\nthey sank towards the dim shape of the _NX-1_ below. Wells' eyes kept\nprobing the thick gloom far beneath. Every moment he expected to see\nit disgorge a swarm of octopi.\n\nThey neared the submarine, and saw numberless pitted spots in her\nbody, where the heat ray had stabbed for a moment. In their excitement\nthey missed their level by some feet, but clutching together they\nadmitted more air and soon rose even with the starboard exit port.\n\n\"Swim forward,\" Keith ordered. \"Hurry!\" The weird figures groped\nclumsily, and very slowly neared the port. The commander, in the van,\nat last reached out and gripped its jutting external controls. He\ncould not work them at first: his hands were numb and awkward.\n\nAs he tugged and struggled with them a shout rang in his headphone. It\nwas McKegnie, scared to death.\n\n\"Oh, hurry, Mr. Wells!\" he yelled. \"Quick! Quick, please! The octopis\nship's comin', sir! The red light's back!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n_To the Death_\n\nThe emergency steadied Keith's fingers. He got the door open and\nmotioned Graham and six men inside the water chamber. The passage took\nbut a minute. Then he sent the rest of the crew in, being himself the\nlast to enter. When the chamber was finally empty, and Wells had\nstepped through the inner door onto the lower deck of the _NX-1_, a\ngreat sigh of relief broke from him. Never before had anything looked\nso good as that brilliantly lit deck with its familiar maze of\nmachinery and bulkheads.\n\n\"Thank God,\" he said simply, and his joy was shared by the whole crew.\nA new feeling had come over them. Back home--in their own submarine,\ntheir own element--they had at least a fighting chance with the\noctopi. But Keith let them waste no time. He knew that a final,\ndesperate duel to the death with their foe still was ahead. \"Above to\nthe control room,\" he ordered. \"Fast!\"\n\nThey lumbered up the connecting ramp. A disheveled, wild-eyed form met\nthem. Keith couldn't help chuckling as he passed the now much thinner\nand paler cook, with the arsenal handy at his waist. On the deck of\nthe control room lay a huge tentacled body, metal-scaled, with its\ndome of glass shattered and its great cold eyes staring unseeingly\naway. \"I killed him,\" stammered McKegnie pridefully; \"but Mr.\nWells--look at that red light, sir!\"\n\nKeith glanced rapidly at the location chart, ripping off his sea-suit\nas he did. The fateful red stud was moving swiftly down on the\nmotionless green one. The men had surrounded McKegnie, laughing and\nslapping him on the back, but the commander's terse orders jerked them\nabruptly back to action.\n\n\"The rectifiers, Graham: clean out this stale air. Sea-suits off; at\nemergency posts. Take the helm, Craig; you, Wetherby, trim the ship.\nNo, no, Cook--keep away from the controls!\"\n\nThe _NX-1_ balanced herself; fresh air came rushing in, sweeping out\nthe stale. Keith stared at the location chart, waiting for the\nsubmarine to be ready. The red light was almost upon them.\n\n\"Right!\" he roared at last. \"Diving rudder controls, Graham! Full\nspeed for the tunnel!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt that moment the octopi ship swept into view, its full battery of\noffensive weapons flaring forth. The paralyzing ray tingled again and\nagain over the control room. Someone laughed at its uselessness. The\nviolet heat ray leveled full at them, but the commander avoided it\nwith \"Port ten, starboard ten! Maintain zigzag course to the tunnel.\"\nHe understood the enemy's weapons now; he was throbbing with the\nfierce thrill of action. This duel was to be the climax of their whole\nadventure. \"And, by heaven,\" he promised, \"it's going to be a fight!\"\n\nThe other craft seemed to realize the _NX-1_ was now in expert hands.\nShe raced along to starboard for some minutes, her heat ray trying\nvainly to steady on the American's weaving form. Wells wondered if the\nking of the octopi was aboard her, in command; he thought perhaps the\nship had postponed her chase of McKegnie to pick him up. \"I hope he\nis!\" the commander breathed, and fingered the torpedo lever. He had\nsome debts to pay.\n\nThe _NX-1_, engines working smoothly, proceeded on a desperate dash\nfor the tunnel that led to the outer sea. But the octopi ship\napparently knew what Keith intended, for she abandoned her offensive\nrays, changed course a few degrees and slowly but steadily pulled\nahead. \"Damn!\" Keith exclaimed. \"She'll get there before us!\"\n\nThe dim shape dwindled on the screen, and before long her bulk had\ndisappeared entirely. Wells then could watch her swift, straight\nprogress only on the location chart.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTen minutes later the funnel-like opening of the tunnel loomed on the\nteleview, and squarely in front, blocking it, was the waiting form of\nthe octopi submarine.\n\n\"Quarter speed!\" Keith snapped. \"Hold her steady, Graham; I'm going to\ntry a bow torpedo. I think we're beyond their ray.\"\n\nSighting his range on the telescopic range-finder, he worked the\n_NX-1_ slowly into position. He noticed that his first officer was\nstaring oddly at him. He was bothered by the queer look. \"What's\nwrong?\" he asked impatiently.\n\n\"But--what about Hemmy Bowman?\"\n\nBowman! In the rush of action and suspense, Keith Wells had completely\nforgotten his officer in the enemy submarine. \"Oh, God!\" he groaned.\nThe cruel situation that had stayed his hand once before had again\ncome to falter his course of action. The men were watching him; Graham\nhad a question in his eyes. They all knew what had to be decided....\n\nKeith shrugged his shoulders hopelessly. It was his greater duty to\ndestroy the octopi submarine. And yet--\n\n\"Fish for Hemmy, Sparks,\" he ordered. \"Craig, keep present distance\nfrom enemy. Full stop.\"\n\nA moment later the radio operator looked up. \"Mr. Bowman on the\nphones, sir.\" With a heavy weight on his heart the commander clipped\non the extension headphones.\n\n\"Hemmy?\"\n\n\"Keith? Keith? Thank God you're alive!\" Bowman's voice shook with\ngladness. \"You're all back on the _NX-1_, Keith? The whole crew's with\nyou? Oh, Lord, it's good to hear you again!\"\n\n\"Yes. We got back all right, Hemmy--a miracle. They've still got you\nprisoner?\"\n\n\"Yes.... Keith--you're trying to dodge out of the tunnel, aren't you?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWells smiled bitterly, and as he paused to frame an answer Bowman\nspoke again.\n\n\"I want you to blow up this submarine, Keith,\" he said quickly. \"A\nfavor to me.\"\n\nHe cut Wells short when the commander started to interrupt. \"Wait! Let\nme finish,\" he pleaded. \"I want to explain. I'd been hoping--but never\nmind that.... Keith, a while ago I managed to work loose. I lost my\nhead completely and tackled these devils. It was a foolish thing to\ndo; they overcame me, naturally. But, in the struggle, they tore my\nsea-suit.\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"Oh, just a tiny tear, or I wouldn't have lasted till now. But a leak\nall the same--in the right leg. Since then I've been gripping the\nedges of the fabric as tightly as I can--but I couldn't keep the water\ninside this ship from seeping through. It came in slowly at first,\nthen faster as my hands grew numb. It's up to my neck now, Keith ...\nand--it won't be long! I've just a few minutes left....\"\n\nThe faint words tapered into silence.\n\n\"No!\" roared Keith in a great rush of emotion. But Hemmy's eager\nvoice came right back:\n\n\"Oh yes, you must! It would be a mercy to kill me, Keith.\"\n\nThere were tears in the commander's eyes. \"Are you sure, Hemmy?\" he\nasked. \"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. It would be a mercy.\"\n\nWells' lips formed a straight grim line. His words squeezed through it\ntightly. \"All right, Hemmy. Thanks. Thanks. I--I'll go after them now,\nold man. I'll try and keep in touch with you through the duel, but\nI--I can't promise--\"\n\nHe could almost see Hemingway Bowman give his old familiar smile as he\nanswered:\n\n\"Then so long, Keith!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCommander Keith Wells studied the teleview screen. The men were half\nafraid to look at his strained blanched face.\n\nRepeatedly the violet beam speared through the water, reaching for the\n_NX-1's_ bow.\n\n\"Turn ship. Line up for stern torpedoes,\" the commander ordered\nharshly. He realized he could not hold his submarine steady to obtain\na perfect sight, for the heat ray needed only thirty seconds to melt\nthrough their shell. He would have to swing the ship slowly about;\nand, as the shape of the enemy crossed the hair-lines on the\nrange-finder, unleash his torpedoes and gamble on hitting the moving\ntarget.\n\nThe _NX-1_ swung around, always maintaining a slight forward motion\nand zigzagging constantly to nullify the heat beam. Wells watched the\nrange-finder closely. The octopi ship slanted downwards, the deadly\nviolet ray stabbing from her bow. Slowly the black dot that\nrepresented her appeared on the dial, and slowly it dropped towards\nthe crossed lines that showed the perfect firing point.\n\nKeith grasped the torpedo lever. The _NX-1's_ stern was towards her\ntarget. Dead silence hung in the control room. The _NX-1_ swung\nslightly. The octopi craft appeared directly in the middle of the\ndial.\n\nWells pulled back the lever.\n\nThe hiss of compressed air sprang from her stern. He had fired two\ntubes, his whole stock of stern torpedoes. The pair of dreadful\nweapons leaped out and settled on their course. Keith shot his gaze to\nthe teleview.\n\nThe torpedoes missed. Only by feet, but a miss all the same. They\nraced on past the octopi submarine and, with a tremendous, ear-numbing\nexplosion, burst on the wall of the cavern beyond. Both ships reeled\nfrom the shock. Graham swore viciously, but Wells' masklike face\nshowed no slightest change of expression....\n\nA voice rang in Keith's headphones. \"Tough, Keith! Better luck next\ntime!\" Then the commander winced. He simply could not answer Hemmy\nBowman; could not answer that fine, brave voice....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe stern torpedoes were gone. The tubes could not be reloaded, for\nthe paralyzing ray bound the men to the control room. That left them\ntwo torpedoes in the bow.\n\nThe violet heat ray kept fingering hungrily on their outer hull, and\nevery man knew that the plates were weakening under the steady strain,\nwhich was only lessened by the _NX-1's_ constant zigzagging. The\ncontrol room was very hot. Both ships were now a full mile from the\ntunnel entrance. Keith plunged the _NX-1_ down, swung her around, to\nbring his bow tubes to bear, and zigzagged upwards.\n\nIt was obvious that the octopi craft had been alarmed by the terrific\nexplosion. They now adopted tactics similar to the American ship's,\nand for awhile both submarines circled cautiously, maneuvering for an\nopening.\n\n\"If only we could keep the ship steady!\" Graham muttered. \"But then\nthat heat ray'd get us!\"\n\nThe commander kept his eyes on the teleview. Again and again the\nviolet shaft pronged at them. The heat grew stifling. Sweat was\npouring from all the men's bodies. Every face was strained and taut.\n\n\"Starboard full!\" Wells said suddenly. \"A little up, Graham!\" He had\nseen a chance; the octopi craft was slightly above, and in a moment\nwould pass directly in the line of the bow tubes. The _NX-1_ stuck her\nnose up, swung rapidly to the right. Keith pulled back the firing\nlever, releasing one torpedo.\n\nThe long messenger of death hurtled straight for the enemy's hull.\nThey watched its course breathlessly....\n\n\"My God!\" the first officer groaned. \"Could they see it coming?\" For\nthe octopi submarine had swung to one side, neatly dodging the\nspeeding tube of dynamite.\n\n\"One left!\" he added bitterly. \"One left!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA desperate plan formed in Keith Wells' mind. His last torpedo simply\nhad to strike the mark; he could take no chances with it. He motioned\nthe haggard-faced Graham to him.\n\n\"There's only one thing left to do,\" he said quietly. \"We've got to\ndeliberately face that heat ray; chance its puncturing our plates.\"\n\n\"How do you mean, sir?\"\n\n\"Get in very close, so as to make our last torpedo sure to hit. We've\ngot to approach the enemy head-on at full speed. We'll corkscrew up to\nthem until we get within two hundred yards, then go straight forward\nfor ten or fifteen seconds, giving us the opportunity to sight the\nremaining torpedo directly on them. The heat ray may break through\nbefore I fire--but when I do fire it's a sure hit.\"\n\nThe men had heard every word. Quietly Wells ordered:\n\n\"Take the torpedo control, Graham. I'll take the helm.\"\n\nThe first officer obeyed without a word. Keith grasped the helm. The\nplans were made for their last desperate attempt.\n\n\"Right,\" the commander said shortly. \"Here we go.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere had been a taut silence before, but now, knowing that they were\ndeliberately offering themselves a perfect target for the heat ray in\norder to get their last torpedo home, the intensity was almost\nunbearable. The men felt like shrieking, jumping--doing anything to\nbreak the awful hush. The air was charged with the same unnameable\nsomething that heralds a typhoon.\n\nKeith Wells was like a white statue at the helm, save for the\nbetraying trickles of sweat that coursed down his drawn cheeks. His\nhands moved the wheel slowly from port to starboard; his eyes bored at\nthe screen before him. The ship was in command of a man of steel, a\nman with but one purpose....\n\n\"Up--up,\" he ordered. \"Hold--in trim--full speed forward!\"\n\nHe had brought the _NX-1_ directly in line with the octopi ship. And\nnow the craft leaped forward under full power, while he shot the helm\nback and forth ceaselessly. His ship was describing a corkscrewing\nmotion, weaving straight at the enemy. Grasping her opportunity, the\noctopi submarine remained motionless, steadily dousing the approaching\nAmerican craft with her silent violet ray and driving the temperature\nin the control room to even greater heights.\n\nThe distance between them rapidly lessened. Would the plates stand it?\nWould the ray melt through the weakened steel before he could fire?\nWith an effort Keith drove these doubts from his mind ... but he could\nnot banish a certain dull, steady ache from his consciousness....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe range dwindled. The heat became intolerable. Everyone's clothing\nwas sopping wet. A man ripped off his shirt, gasping for air. Wells\nkept his eyes on the screen, though half-blinded by smarting sweat.\nThe plates had to give soon, he knew.\n\nThe octopi submarine, beam on and dead ahead, began to move to port at\nquickly increasing speed. At once Keith stopped swinging the helm, and\nthe _NX-1's_ corkscrewing motion of protection ceased. And then came\nthe real test, the gauntlet of seconds.\n\nRight straight into the retreating violet beam they went, at top\nspeed. They gained rapidly. The heat was furnace-like. The commander,\nwatching the range-finder, kept moving the helm slightly over. A shaft\nof violet heat spanned the two shells of metal. For ten seconds it had\nheld on the _NX-1_. The black dot of the enemy craft moved slowly to\nexact center on the dial. Fifteen seconds ... twenty ...\ntwenty-three--\n\n\"Fire!\"\n\nGraham jammed the torpedo lever back.\n\n\"Crash dive!\"\n\nThe deck tilted downward. And Wells' white lips formed the words, \"So\nlong, Hemmy!\"--and he tore the phones from his head.\n\nSeconds later a titanic explosion sounded through the cavern; echoed\nand re-echoed in vasty roars. The American craft's lights went\noff--but not before her men had seen, in the teleview, a fire-shot\nmaelstrom where a moment before the octopi submarine had been.\n\n\"We got them!\" yelled Graham.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA roar of exultation burst from every throat. The men flung their arms\nout, jumped, yelled crazily. Faint emergency lights lit the scene.\n\n\"Below, at regular posts,\" Wells ordered. \"Reload bow and stern tubes.\nGraham, see to the lights.\" He himself remained at the helm. In a few\nmoments the submarine had climbed back to the level of the tunnel. At\nquarter speed she nosed into the wide entrance, and slowly forged into\nthe dense, deceptive shadows.\n\nThe commander acted mechanically. Again by touch he steered his ship\nthrough the black, ragged cleft. Fifteen minutes after leaving the\ncavern of the octopi her bow poked through the weaving kelp into the\nfree, salty depths of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThere was one more task to perform, and Wells lost no time in doing\nit. When two hundred yards away he halted the _NX-1_, steadied her and\nsighted the stern tubes just above the dark tunnel hole. Quickly he\nsent forth two torpedoes.\n\nA huge roar rumbled through the water, whipping the beds of kelp to\nmad convulsions. \"Turn around,\" the commander ordered harshly. He\nsighted his bow tubes and again let loose a bolt of two torpedoes.\nThen he sent the submarine forward, and, through the teleview,\nexamined what his four weapons had done.\n\nHuge chunks of rock had been tumbled down, completely closing the\ntunnel.\n\n\"Well,\" said Graham, \"it's over! Finished! They'll never get through\nthat!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA full-throated cheer burst from the men below, a cheer that rang for\nminutes as they realized they were free forever of the octopi, of the\ncold underwater city, of the clutching tentacles. Graham grinned\nbroadly.\n\n\"Sound happy--eh?\" he chuckled. \"Say, Keith, it's good we've got those\ntwo octopi our fighting cook killed. Knapp would never believe our\nstory without them!\"\n\nHe stared curiously at his commander. Wells was standing quite still,\nfacing the teleview screen. A strange, far-away look was in his eyes.\n\n\"What's the matter, old man?\" the first officer asked, smiling\nstraight at him. \"Aren't you glad we won through?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" answered Keith with a tired smile in return.\n\n\"But why did you look that way?\" Graham persisted. And Keith Wells\ntold him:\n\n\"I was just wondering if Hemmy told the truth.\"\n\n\n\n\nThe Black Lamp\n\n_By Captain S. P. Meek_\n\n[Illustration: _\"Look out!\" He leaped to one side as he spoke._]\n\n[Sidenote: Dr. Bird and his friend Carnes unravel another criminal web\nof scientific mystery.]\n\n\n\"The clue, Carnes,\" said Dr. Bird slowly, \"lies in those windows.\"\n\nOperative Carnes of the United States Secret Service shook his head\nbefore he glanced at the windows of the famous scientist's private\nlaboratory on the top floor of the Bureau of Standards.\n\n\"I usually defer to your knowledge, Doctor,\" he said, \"but this time I\nthink you are off on the wrong foot. If the thieves came in through\nthe windows, what was their object in cutting that hole through the\nroof? The marks are very plain and they indicate that the hole was cut\nin some manner from the inside.\"\n\nDr. Bird smiled enigmatically.\n\n\"That is too evident for discussion,\" he replied. \"I grant you that\nthe thieves entered from the roof through that hole. After they had\nsecured their booty they left by the same route. I presume that you\nhave noticed the marks on the roof where an aircraft of some sort,\nprobably a helicopter, landed and took off. A question of much greater\nmoment is that of what they did before they landed and cut the hole.\"\n\n\"I don't follow your reasoning, Doctor.\"\n\n\"Carnes, that hole was cut through the roof with a heavy saw. In\ncutting it, the workers dislodged quite a little plaster which fell to\nthe floor and must have made a great deal of noise. Why wasn't that\nnoise heard?\"\n\n\"It was heard. The watchman heard it, but knew that Lieutenant Breslau\nwas working here and he thought that he made the noise.\"\n\n\"Surely, but why didn't Breslau hear it?\"\n\n\"How do we know that he didn't? He was taken to Walter Reed Hospital\nthis morning with his mind an absolute blank and with his tongue\nparalyzed. He must have seen the thieves and they treated him in some\nway to ensure his silence. When he is able to talk, if he ever is,\nhe'll probably give us a good description of them.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Bird shook his head.\n\n\"Too thin, Carney, old dear,\" he said. \"Breslau is a very intelligent\nyoung man. He was perfectly normal when I left him shortly after\nmidnight last night. He was working alone in here on a device of the\nutmost military importance. On the desk is a push button which sets\nringing a dozen gongs in the building. Surely a man of that type would\nhave had sense enough when he heard and saw intruders cutting a hole\nthrough the roof to sound an alarm which would have brought every\nwatchman on the grounds to his assistance. He must have been knocked\nout before the hole was started, probably before the helicopter's\nlanding.\"\n\n\"How? Gas of some sort?\"\n\n\"The windows were all closed and locked and I have already ascertained\nthat the gas and water lines have not been tampered with. Gas won't\npenetrate through a solid roof in sufficient concentration to knock\nout a man like that. It was something more subtle than gas.\"\n\n\"What was it?\"\n\n\"I don't know yet. The clue to what it was lies, as I told you, in\nthose windows.\"\n\nCarnes moved over and surveyed the windows closely.\n\n\"I see nothing unusual about them except that they need washing rather\nbadly.\"\n\n\"They were washed last Friday, but they do look rather dirty, don't\nthey? Suppose you take a rag and some scouring soap and clean up a\npane.\"\n\nThe detective took the proffered articles and started his task. He wet\na pane of glass, rubbed up a thick lather of scouring soap and applied\nit and rubbed vigorously. With clear water he washed the glass and\nthen gave an exclamation of astonishment and examined it more closely.\n\n\"That isn't dirt, Doctor,\" he cried. \"The glass seems to be fogged.\"\n\nDr. Bird chuckled.\n\n\"So it seems,\" he admitted. \"Now look at the rest of the glass around\nthe laboratory.\"\n\nCarnes looked around and then walked to a table littered with\napparatus and examined a dozen pieces carefully.\n\n\"It's all fogged in exactly the same way, Doctor,\" he said. \"The only\npiece of clear glass in the room is that piece of plate glass on your\ndesk.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Bird picked up a hammer and struck the plate on his desk a sharp\nblow. Carnes ducked instinctively, but the hammer rebounded harmlessly\nfrom the plate.\n\n\"That isn't glass, Carnes,\" said the doctor. \"That plate is made of\nvitrilene, a new product which I have developed. It looks like glass,\nbut it has entirely different properties. It is of enormous strength\nand is quite insensitive to shock. It has one most peculiar property.\nWhile ultra-violet and longer rays will penetrate it quite readily, it\nis a perfect screen for X-rays and other rays of shorter wave length.\nIt appears to be the only piece of transparent substance in my\nlaboratory which has not been fogged, as you call it.\"\n\n\"Do short waves fog glass, Doctor?\"\n\n\"Not so far as I know at present, but you must remember that very\nlittle work has been done with the short wave-lengths. In the vast\nrange of waves whose lengths lie between zero and that of the X-ray,\nonly a few points have been investigated and definitely plotted. There\nmay be in that range a wave-length which will fog glass.\"\n\n\"Then your theory is that some sort of a ray machine was put in\noperation before the helicopter landed?\"\n\n\"It is too early to attempt any theorizing, Carnes. Let us confine\nourselves to the known facts. Lieutenant Breslau was normal at\nmidnight and was working in this room. Some time between then and\nseven this morning he underwent certain mental and physical changes\nwhich prevent him from telling us what he observed. During the same\nperiod, a hole was cut in the roof and things of great importance\nstolen. At the same time, all the glass in the laboratory became\nsemi-opaque. The problem is to determine what connection there is\nbetween the three events. I will handle the scientific end here, but\nthere is some outside work to be done, and that will be your share.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Give your orders, Doctor,\" said the detective briefly.\n\n\"To understand what I am driving at, I will have to tell you what has\nbeen stolen. Naturally this is highly confidential. Some rumors have\nleaked out as to my experiments with 'radite,' as I have named the\nnew radium-containing disintegrating explosive on which I have been\nworking, but no one short of the Secretary of War and the Chief of\nOrdnance and certain of their selected subordinates knows that my\nexperiments have been successful and that the United States is in a\nposition to manufacture radite in almost unlimited quantities from the\npitchblende ore deposits of Wyoming and Nevada. The effects of radite\nwill be catastrophic on the unfortunate victim on whom it is first\nused. The only thing left to do was to develop a gun from which radite\nshells could be fired with safety and precision.\n\n\"Ordinary propellant powders are too variable for this purpose, but I\nfound that radite B, one form of my new explosive, can be used for\npropelling the shells from a gun. The ordinary gun will last only two\nor three rounds, due to the erosive action of the radite charge on the\nbarrel, and ordinary ordnance is heavier and more cumbersome than is\nnecessary. When this was found to be the case, the Chief of Ordnance\ndetailed Lieutenant Breslau, the army's greatest expert on gun design,\nto work with me in an attempt to develop a suitable weapon. Breslau is\na wizard at that sort of work and he has made a miniature working\nmodel of a gun with a vitrilene-lined barrel which is capable of being\nfired with a miniature shell. The gun will stand up under the repeated\nfiring of radite charges and is very light and compact and gives an\naccuracy of fire control heretofore deemed impossible. From this he\nplanned to construct a larger weapon which would fire a shell\ncontaining an explosive charge of two and one-half ounces of radite at\na rate of fire of two hundred shots per minute. The destructive effect\nof each shell will be greater than that of the ordinary high-explosive\nshell fired from a sixteen-inch mortar, and all of the shells can be\nlanded inside a two-hundred foot circle at a range of fifteen miles.\nThe weight of the completed gun will be less than half a ton,\nexclusive of the firing platform. It is Breslau's working model which\nhas been stolen.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCarnes whistled softly between his teeth.\n\n\"The matter will have to be handled pretty delicately to avoid\ninternational complications,\" he said. \"It's hard to tell just where\nto look. There are a great many nations who would give any amount for\na model of such a weapon.\"\n\n\"The matter must be handled delicately and also in absolute secrecy,\nCarnes. We are not yet ready to announce to the world the fact that we\nhave such a weapon in our armory. It is the plan of the President to\nhave a half dozen of these weapons manufactured and give a\ndemonstration of their terrible effectiveness to representatives of\nthe powers of the world. Think what an argument the existence of such\na weapon will be for the furtherance of his plans for disarmament and\nuniversal peace! Public sentiment will force disarmament on the world,\nfor even the worst jingoist could no longer defend armaments in the\nface of America's offer to scrap these super-engines of destruction\nand to destroy the plans from which they were made. If the model has\nfallen into the hands of any civilized power the damage is not\nirreparable, for public opinion would force its surrender and return.\nIt is among the uncivilized powers that our search must first be\nmade.\"\n\n\"That makes the problem of where to start more complicated.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, it simplifies it immensely. At the head of the\nuncivilized powers stands one which has the brains, the scientific\nknowledge and the manufacturing facilities to make terrible use of\nsuch a weapon. In addition, the aim of that power is to overthrow all\nworld governments and set up in their stead its own tyrannical\ndisorder. Need I name it?\"\n\n\"You refer to Russia.\"\n\n\"Not to Russia, the great slumbering giant who will some day take her\nplace in the sun in fellowship with the other nations, but to\nBolsheviki, that empire within an empire, that horrible power which is\nholding sleeping Russia in chains of steel and blood. It is there that\nour search must first be made.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Of course, they have no official representative in America.\"\n\n\"No, but the Young Labor Party is as much their accredited\nrepresentative as the British Ambassador is of imperial Britain. Your\nfirst task will be to trail down and locate every leader of that group\nand to investigate his present activities.\"\n\n\"I can tell you where most of them are without investigation. Denberg,\nSemensky and Karuska are in Atlanta; Fedorovitch and Caspar are in\nLeavenworth; Saranoff is dead--\"\n\n\"Presumably.\"\n\n\"Why, Doctor, I saw with my own eyes the destruction of the submarine\nin which he was riding!\"\n\n\"Did you see his dead body?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Neither did I, and I will never be sure until I do. Once before we\nwere certain of his death, and he bobbed up with a new fiendish\ndevice. We cannot eliminate Saranoff.\"\n\n\"I will include him in my plans.\"\n\n\"Do so. Besides a hypothetical Saranoff, there are a half dozen or\nmore of the old leaders of the gang who are alive and at liberty, so\nfar as we know. They fled the country after the Coast Guard broke up\ntheir alien smuggling scheme, but some of them may have returned.\nThere are also thirty or forty underlings who should be located and\nchecked up on, and, in addition, we must not lose sight of the fact\nthat new heads of the organization may have been smuggled into the\nUnited States. It is no simple task that I am setting you, Carnes, but\nI know that you and Bolton will see it through if anyone can.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Doctor, we'll do our best. If I am not speaking out of turn,\nwhat are you planning to do in the mean time?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I am going to start Taylor off on an ultra-short wave generator and\ntry a few experiments along that line. Breslau is at Walter Reed and\nthey are doing all they can for him, but until I can get some definite\ninformation as to the underlying cause of his condition, they are more\nor less shooting in the dark.\"\n\n\"How are they treating him?\"\n\n\"By electric stimulations and vibratory treatments and by keeping him\nin a darkened room. By the way, Carnes, if I am correct in my line of\nthought, it would be well to have an extra guard put over Karuska. He\nwas the only real expert in ordnance that the Young Labor party had,\nand if they have Breslau's model they'll need him to supervise the\nconstruction of a gun.\"\n\n\"I'll attend to that at once, Doctor. Is there anything else?\"\n\n\"Not that I know of. I am going out to Takoma Park this afternoon and\nhave another look at Breslau, but it is too soon to hope for any\nchange in his condition. Aside from the time I will be out there, you\ncan find me either here or at my home, in case anything develops.\"\n\n\"I'll get on the job at once, Doctor.\"\n\n\"Thanks, old dear. Remember that speed must be the keynote of your\nwork.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe telephone bell at the head of Dr. Bird's bed woke into noisy\nactivity. The doctor roused himself and took down the instrument\nsleepily. A glance at the clock showed him that it was four in the\nmorning and he muttered a malediction on the one who had called him.\n\n\"Hello,\" he said into the receiver. \"Dr. Bird speaking.\"\n\n\"Doctor,\" came a crisp voice over the wire, \"wake up! This is Carnes\ntalking. Something has broken loose!\"\n\nAll trace of sleep vanished from Dr. Bird's face and his eyes glowed\nmomentarily with a peculiar glitter which Carnes would at once have\nrecognized as indicative of the keenest interest.\n\n\"What has happened, Carnes?\" he demanded.\n\n\"I telephoned Atlanta this morning and arranged to have an extra guard\nput over Karuska as you suggested. The matter was simplified by the\nfact that he and nine others were confined in the prison infirmary.\nThe warden agreed to do as I told him, and, in addition to the regular\nguards, a special man was placed in the ward near Karuska's bed. At 2\nA. M. the lights in the ward went out.\"\n\n\"Accidentally, or were they put out?\"\n\n\"They haven't found out yet. At any rate they are all right now, but\nKaruska and all of the other inmates and all the guards of that\nparticular ward have gone crazy.\"\n\n\"The dickens you say!\"\n\n\"Not only that, they are also partially paralyzed. The description I\ngot over the telephone corresponds exactly with the condition of\nLieutenant Breslau as you described it to me. Here is the most\ninteresting part of the whole affair. The special guard over Karuska\nwas only lightly affected and has already recovered and is in a\nposition to tell you exactly what happened. I got a garbled account of\nthe affair from the warden, something about a goldfish bowl or\nsomething like that, the warden wouldn't take it seriously enough to\ngive me details. I didn't press for them much for I knew that you\nwould rather get them at first hand.\"\n\n\"I certainly would. I'll be ready to leave for Atlanta in less than\nten minutes.\"\n\n\"I expected that, Doctor, and a car is already on its way to pick you\nup. I'll meet you at Langley Field where a plane is already being\ntuned up and will be ready to take off by the time we get there.\"\n\n\"Good work, Carnes. I'll see you at the field.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA car was waiting for Carnes and Dr. Bird when the Langley Field plane\nslid down to a landing at Atlanta. At the penitentiary, Dr. Bird went\ndirect to the infirmary where Karuska had been confined. As he\nentered, he shot a keen glance around and gave an exclamation of\nsatisfaction.\n\n\"Look at the windows, Carnes,\" he cried.\n\nCarnes went over to the nearest window and moistened his finger tip\nand applied it experimentally to the glass. The moisture produced no\neffect, for the glass of the windows was permanently clouded as was\nthat of the doctor's laboratory.\n\n\"Whatever happened in my laboratory the night before last was repeated\nhere last night with a similar object,\" said the doctor. \"The object\nthere was to steal a gun model; here it was to steal a man who could\nconstruct a full-sized gun from the model. I understand that one of\nthe guards escaped the fate which overtook the rest of the persons in\nthe infirmary?\"\n\n\"Not altogether, Doctor,\" replied the warden. \"I think that his mind\nis somewhat affected, for he tells a wild yarn and insists on trying\nto wear a goldfish bowl on his head. I have him under observation in\nthe psychopathic ward.\"\n\nDr. Bird shot a scornful glance at the warden.\n\n\"'There are none so blind as those who will not see',\" he murmured.\n\n\"By all means, I wish to see him,\" he went on aloud. \"Will you have\nhim brought here at once, please?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe warden nodded and spoke to one of the attendants. In a few moments\na tall, fair-haired young giant stood before the doctor. Dr. Bird\npushed back his unruly shock of black hair with his fingers, those\nlong slim mobile fingers which alone betrayed the artist in his\nmake-up, and shot a piercing glance from his black eyes into the blue\nones, which returned the gaze unabashed.\n\n\"What is your name?\" he asked.\n\n\"Bailley, sir.\"\n\n\"You were on guard here last night?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. I was detailed as a special guard over No. 9764.\"\n\n\"Tell me in your own words just what happened. Don't be afraid to\nspeak out; I'm not going to disbelieve you; and above all, tell me\neverything, no matter how unimportant it may seem to you. I'll judge\nthe importance of things for myself. I'm Dr. Bird of the Bureau of\nStandards.\"\n\nThe guard's face lighted up at the doctor's words.\n\n\"I've heard of you, Doctor,\" he said in a relieved tone, \"and I'll be\nglad to tell you everything. At ten o'clock last night, I relieved\nCarragher as special guard over No. 9764. Carragher reported that the\nprisoner was somewhat restless and hadn't been asleep as yet. I sat\ndown about fifteen feet from his bed and prepared to keep an eye on\nhim until I was relieved at six o'clock this morning.\n\n\"Nothing happened until about two o'clock. No. 9764 was restless as\nCarragher had said, but toward midnight he quieted down and apparently\nwent to sleep. I was sleepy myself, and I got up and took a turn\naround the room every five minutes to be sure that I kept awake.\nThat's how I am so sure of the time, sir.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Bird nodded.\n\n\"At five minutes to two, just as I got up, I heard a noise outside\nlike a big electric fan. It sounded like it came from directly\noverhead and I went to the window and looked out. I couldn't see\nanything, although I could hear it pretty plainly, and then I heard a\nnoise like something had fallen on the roof. Almost at the same time\nthere came a sort of high-pitched whine, a good deal like the noise an\nelectric motor makes when it is running at high speed.\n\n\"I thought of giving an alarm, but I didn't want to stir things up\nunless I was sure that there was some necessity for it, so I started\nfor the door to ask one of the outside guards if he had heard\nanything. As I turned toward No. 9764 I saw that he had been sitting\nup in bed while my back was turned. As soon as he saw that I noticed\nhim, he lay back real quick and pulled the covers over his head. He\nmoved pretty quick, but not so quick that I couldn't see that he had\nsomething that glittered like glass before his face. I started over\ntoward his bed to see what he was doing and then it was that the\nlights started to get dim!\"\n\n\"Go on!\" said the doctor as Bailley paused. His eyes were glittering\nbrightly now.\n\n\"Well, sir, Doctor, I don't hardly know how to describe what happened\nnext. The lights were getting dim, but not as they ordinarily do when\nthe current starts to go off. The filaments were shining as bright as\nthey ever did, but the light didn't seem to be able to penetrate the\nair. The whole room seemed to be filled with a blackness that stopped\nthe light. No, sir, it wasn't like fog; it was more like something\nmore powerful than the lights was in the room and was killing them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It wasn't only the lights which were affected, it was me as well.\nThis blackness, whatever it was, was getting into me as well as into\nthe room, and I couldn't seem to make myself think like I wanted to. I\ntried to yell to give an alarm, and I found that I could hardly\nwhisper. I went toward the bed and then I saw No. 9764 sit up again.\nHe had a goldfish bowl pulled down over his head and it was evident\nthat it was keeping the blackness away, for I could see him plainly\nand his eyes were as bright as ever.\n\n\"The nearer I got to him, the funnier I felt, and I began to be afraid\nthat I would go out. No. 9764 got up out of bed, and I could see him\ngrinning at me through the bowl. He reached up and adjusted that bowl,\nand all of a sudden I realized that whatever was knocking me out was\nnot affecting him because he had that thing on. I jumped for him with\nthe idea of taking the bowl off and putting it on my own head. He saw\nwhat I was up to and he fought like a cornered rat, but the blackness\nhadn't affected my muscles. I'm a pretty big man, sir, and No. 9764 is\na little runt, and it didn't take me long to get the bowl off his head\nand pulled on over mine. As soon as I did that, I seemed to be able to\nthink clearer. I was sitting on No. 9764 and was ready to tap him with\na persuader if he started anything, but I didn't have to. In a few\nminutes he stopped struggling and lay perfectly quiet.\n\n\"The lights kept getting dimmer and dimmer until they went out\naltogether and the room became pitch dark. It wasn't exactly as if the\nlights had gone out, sir; I seemed to know that they were still there\nand were burning as bright as ever, but they couldn't penetrate the\nblackness in the room, if you understand what I mean.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I think I do,\" said Dr. Bird slowly. \"It was a good deal as if you\nhad seen a glass filled with a pale red liquid and someone had dumped\nblack ink into the fluid and hid the red color. You would know that\nthe red was still there, but you wouldn't be able to see it through\nthe black.\"\n\n\"That's exactly what it was like, Doctor; you have described it better\nthan I can. At any rate, after it got real dark I heard a low whistle\nfrom the roof. No. 9764 made a struggle to get up for a moment and\nthen lay quiet again. The whistle sounded again and then I heard some\none call 'Caruso.' Everything was quiet for a while and then the same\nvoice called again and said some stuff in a foreign language that I\ncouldn't understand. I kept perfectly quiet to see what would happen.\n\n\"For about ten minutes the room remained perfectly dark, as I have\nsaid, and all the while I could hear that whining noise. All of a\nsudden it began to sound in a lower note and then I could see the\nlights again, very dimly and like the black ink you spoke of was\nfading out. The note got lower until it stopped altogether, and the\nlights came on brighter until they were normal again. Then I heard a\nscraping noise on the roof and the noise I had heard at first like a\nbig electric fan. I looked at the clock. It was two-twenty.\n\n\"For a few minutes I wasn't able to collect my wits. When I got up off\nof No. 9764 at last he stared at me as though he didn't know a thing,\nand I heaved him back into his bed and ran to the door to summon an\noutside guard. I could still talk in a husky whisper, but not loud,\nand I wasn't surprised when no one heard me. My orders were not to let\nNo. 9764 out of my sight, but this was an emergency, so I left the\nward and found a guard. It was Madigan and he was standing on his beat\nstaring at nothing. When I touched him he looked at me and there was\nthe same vacant look in his eyes that I had seen in the prisoner's. I\ntalked to him in a whisper, but he didn't seem to understand, so I\nleft him and went to a telephone and called for help. Mr. Lawson, the\nwarden, got here with guards in a couple of minutes and I tried to\ntell him what had happened, but I couldn't talk loud, and I was afraid\nto take the fish bowl off my head.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What happened next?\"\n\n\"Mr. Lawson took me to his office, and on the way we passed under an\narc light. As soon as I got under it I begin to feel better, and my\nvoice came stronger. I saw that it was doing me some good and I\nstopped under it for an hour before my voice got back to normal. It\nseemed to clear the fog from my brain, too, and I was able, about four\no'clock, to tell everything that had happened. Mr. Lawson seemed to\nthink that my brain was affected as well as the others' and he sent me\nto the hospital. That's all, Doctor.\"\n\n\"Do you feel perfectly normal now?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"There is no need for confining this man longer, Mr. Lawson. He is as\nwell as he ever was. Carnes, get the Walter Reed Hospital on the\ntelephone and tell them that I said to treat Lieutenant Breslau with\nlight rays, rich in ultra-violet. Tell them to give him an overdose of\nthem and not to put goggles on him. Keep him in the sun all day and\nunder sun-ray arcs at night until further orders. Mr. Lawson, give the\nsame treatment to the men who were disabled last night. If you haven't\nenough sun-ray arcs in your hospital, put them under an ordinary arc\nlight in the yard. Bailley, have you still got that goldfish bowl?\"\n\n\"It is in my office, Doctor,\" said the warden.\n\n\"Good enough! Send for it at once. By the way, you have two more\ncommunists here, Denberg and Semensky, haven't you?\"\n\n\"I think so, although I will have to consult the records before I can\nbe positive.\"\n\n\"I am sure that you have. Look the matter up and let me know.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe warden hurried away to carry out the doctor's orders, and an\norderly appeared in a few moments with a hollow globe made of some\ncrystalline transparent substance. Despite its presence in the\ninfirmary the evening before, there was no trace of clouding apparent.\nDr. Bird took it and examined it critically. He rapped it with his\nknuckles and then stepped to the door and hurled it violently down on\nthe concrete floor of the yard. The globe rebounded without injury and\nhe caught it.\n\n\"Vitrilene, or a good imitation of it,\" he remarked to Carnes. \"After\nyou get through talking to the hospital, get Taylor on the wire. There\nis plenty of loose vitrilene in the Bureau, and I want him to send\ndown about fifty square feet of it by a special plane at once.\"\n\nAs Carnes left the room, the warden reappeared.\n\n\"The men are all lying in the sun now, Doctor,\" he said. \"I find that\nwe have the two men you mentioned confined here. They are both in Tier\nA, Building 6.\"\n\n\"Is that an isolated building?\"\n\n\"No, it is one wing of the old main building.\"\n\n\"On which floor?\"\n\n\"The second floor. It is a six-story building.\"\n\n\"Have they been moved there recently?\"\n\n\"They have been there for nearly a year.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"In that case there will be little chance of another attack of this\nsort to-night. At the same time, I would advise you to station extra\nguards there to-night and every night until I notify you otherwise.\nCaution them to watch the lights carefully and to give an alarm at\nonce if they appear to get dim. In such a case, send men to the roof\nwith rifles with orders to shoot to kill anyone they find there. I am\ngoing back to Washington and I am going to take Karuska, your No. 9764\nwith me. You had better have one of the guards in the corridor, where\nDenberg and Semensky are, wear this goldfish bowl, as you call it. A\nlot of plate glass--at least it will look like that--will come from\nWashington by plane. Cut it into sheets a foot square and use\nsurgeon's plaster to make some temporary glass helmets for your men. I\nwant all your guards to wear them until I either settle this matter or\nelse send you some better helmets. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"I understand all right, but I'm afraid that I can't do it. The\nwearing of such appliances would interfere with the efficiency of my\nmen as guards.\"\n\n\"Brain and tongue paralysis would interfere rather more seriously, it\nseems to me. In any event, I have sufficient authority to enforce my\nrequest. If you are at all doubtful, call up the Attorney General and\nask him.\"\n\nThe warden hesitated.\n\n\"If you don't mind, I think I will call Washington, Doctor,\" he said.\n\"I will have to get authority to turn No. 9764 over to you in any\nevent.\"\n\n\"Call all you wish, Mr. Lawson. Mr. Carnes is talking to Washington\nnow and we'll have a clear line through for you in a few minutes.\nMeanwhile, get a set of shackles on Karuska and get him ready to\ntravel by plane. He appears to be suffering from mental paralysis, but\nI don't know how his case will develop. He may go violently insane at\nany moment and I don't care to be aloft in a plane with an unbound\nmaniac.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMajor Martin looked up from the prone figure of Karuska.\n\n\"His condition duplicates that of Lieutenant Breslau, Dr. Bird,\" he\nsaid. \"We received your telephoned message this afternoon and we kept\nBreslau in a flood of sunlight until dusk, and then put him under\nsun-ray lamps. I don't know how you got on to that treatment, but it\nis having a very beneficial effect. He can already make inarticulate\nsounds, and his eyes are not quite as vacant at they were. If he keeps\non improving as he has, he should be able to talk intelligently in a\nfew days. If you wish to question this man, why not give him the same\ntreatment?\"\n\n\"I haven't time, Major. I must make him talk to-night if it is humanly\npossible. I called you in because you are the most eminent authority\non the brain in the government service. Is there any way of\nartificially stimulating this man's brain so that we can force the\nsecrets of his subconscious mind from him?\"\n\nThe major sat for a moment in profound thought.\n\n\"There _is_ a way, Doctor,\" he said at length, \"but it is a method\nwhich I would not dare to use. By applying high frequency electrical\nstimulations to the medulla oblongata, at the same time bathing the\ncerebellum with ultra-violet, it might be done, but the chances are\nthat either death or insanity would result. I would not do it.\"\n\n\"Major Martin, this man is a reckless and dangerous international\ncriminal. If his gang carries out the plan which I fear they have\nformed, the lives of thousands, yes, of millions, may pay for your\nhesitation. I will assume full responsibility for the test if you will\nmake it, and I have the authority of the President of the United\nStates behind me.\"\n\n\"In that case, Doctor, I have no choice. The President is the\nCommander-in-chief of the army, and if those are his orders the\nexperiment will be carried out. As a matter of form, I will ask that\nyour orders be reduced to writing.\"\n\n\"I will write them gladly, Major. Please proceed with the experiment\nwithout delay.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMajor Martin bowed and spoke to a waiting orderly. The prostrate\nfigure of Karuska was wheeled down a corridor into the electrical\nlaboratory, and with the aid of the laboratory technician the surgeon\nmade his preparations. The Moss lamp was arranged to throw a flood of\nultra-violet over the Russian's cranium while the leads from a deep\ntherapy X-ray tube was connected, one to the front of Karuska's throat\nand the other to the base of his brain. At a signal from the major, a\nnurse began to administer ether.\n\n\"I guarantee nothing, Dr. Bird,\" said the major. \"The paralysis of the\nvocal cords may be physical, in which case the victim will still be\nunable to speak, regardless of the brain stimulation. If, however, the\nevident paralysis is due to some obscure influence on the brain, it\nmay work.\"\n\n\"In any, event I will hold you blameless and thank you for your help,\"\nreplied the doctor. \"Please start the stimulation.\"\n\nMajor Martin closed a switch, and the hum of a high tension alternator\nfilled the laboratory. The Russian quivered for a moment and then lay\nstill. Major Martin nodded and Dr. Bird stepped to the side of the\noperating table.\n\n\"Ivan Karuska,\" he said slowly and distinctly, \"do you hear me?\"\n\nThe Russian's lips quivered and an unintelligible murmur came from\nthem.\n\n\"Ivan Karuska,\" repeated Dr. Bird, \"do you hear me?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a momentary struggle on the part of the Russian and then a\nsurprisingly clear voice came from his lips.\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Who is the present head of the Young Labor party?\"\n\nAgain there was a pause before the name \"Saranoff\" came from the lips\nof the insensible figure. Carnes gave a sharp exclamation but a\ngesture from the doctor silenced him.\n\n\"Is Saranoff alive?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Is he in the United States?\"\n\n\"No, he is in London.\"\n\n\"Is he coming to the United States?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Soon. As soon as we are ready for him.\"\n\n\"Where is he living in London?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"How did you get word that you were to be rescued from Atlanta?\"\n\n\"A message was smuggled in to me by O'Grady, a guard in our pay.\"\n\n\"What was that vitrilene helmet for?\"\n\n\"To protect me from the effects of the black lamp.\"\n\n\"What is the black lamp?\"\n\n\"I don't know exactly. Saranoff invented it. It gives a black light\nand it kills all other light except sunlight, and it paralyses the\nbrain.\"\n\n\"Did you know that the model of the Breslau gun had been stolen?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What were you going to do after you were rescued from jail?\"\n\n\"I was going to make a full-sized gun. We have a disappearing gun\nplatform built in the swamps at the juncture of the Potomac and\nPiscataway Creek. The gun was to be mounted there and we would shell\nWashington and institute a reign of terror. It would be a signal for\nuprisings all over the country.\"\n\n\"Is there a black lamp at that gun platform?\"\n\n\"Yes. The black lamp will kill both the flash and the report.\"\n\n\"Where did you get the formula for radite?\"\n\n\"We got it from one of Dr. Bird's assistants. His name--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs he spoke the last few sentences, Karuska's voice had steadily risen\nalmost to a shriek. As he endeavored to give the name of the doctor's\ntreacherous helper his voice changed to an unintelligible screech and\nthen died away into silence. Major Martin stepped forward and bent\nover the prone figure. Hurriedly he tore away the electrical\nconnections and placed a stethoscope over the Russian's heart. He\nlistened for a moment and then straightened up, his face pale.\n\n\"I hope that the information you obtained is worth a life, Dr. Bird,\"\nhe said, his voice trembling slightly, \"because it has cost one.\"\n\n\"It may easily save thousands of lives. I thank you, Major, and I will\nsee that no blame attaches to you for your actions. I only wish that\nhe had lived long enough to tell me the name of my assistant who has\nsold me to Saranoff. However, we'll get that information in other\nways. Carnes, telephone Lawson at Atlanta to slam O'Grady into a cell\npending investigation while I get Camp Meade on the wire and order up\na couple of tanks. We are going to attack that gun emplacement at\ndaybreak.\"\n\nThe telephone bell in the laboratory jangled sharply. Major Martin\nanswered it and turned to Carnes.\n\n\"You're wanted on the telephone, Mr. Carnes.\"\n\nThe detective stepped forward and took the transmitter.\n\n\"Carnes speaking,\" he said. \"Yes. Oh, hello, Bolton. Yes, we have\nKaruska here, or rather his body. Yes, Dr. Bird is here right now.\nYou've what? Great Scott, wait a minute.\"\n\n\"Dr. Bird,\" he cried eagerly turning from the telephone, \"Bolton has\nlocated the Washington headquarters of the Young Labor party.\"\n\nDr. Bird sprang to the instrument.\n\n\"Bird speaking, Bolton,\" he cried. \"You've located their headquarters?\nWho's running it? Stanesky, eh? You're on the right track; he used to\nbe Saranoff's right hand man. Where is the place located? I don't seem\nto recollect the spot. You have it well surrounded? Where are you\nspeaking from? All right, we'll join you as quickly as we can. Keep\nyour patrols out and don't let anyone get away.\"\n\nHe hung up the receiver and turned to Carnes.\n\n\"Did you have the car wait?\" he asked. \"Good enough; we'll jump for\nthe Bureau and pick up all the vitrilene laying around loose and then\njoin Bolton. He thinks that he has the whole outfit bottled up.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBolton was waiting as the car rolled up and Dr. Bird leaped out.\n\n\"Where are they?\" demanded the doctor eagerly.\n\n\"In an abandoned factory building about three hundred yards from\nhere,\" replied the Chief of the Secret Service. \"I traced them through\nNew York. We have been watching the place ever since yesterday noon,\nand I know that Stanesky is in there with half a dozen others. No one\nhas tried to leave since we set our watch. One funny thing has\nhappened. About an hour ago a peculiar red glow suffused the whole\nbuilding. It has died down a good deal since, but we can still see it\nthrough the windows. Could you tell us what it means?\"\n\n\"No. I couldn't, Bolton, but we'll find out. How many men have you?\"\n\n\"I have sixteen stationed around.\"\n\n\"That's more than we'll need. I have only vitrilene shields and\nhelmets enough to equip six men. Pick out your three best men to go\nwith us and we'll make a try at entering.\"\n\nBolton strode off into the darkness and returned in a few moments with\nthree men at his heels. Dr. Bird spoke briefly to the operatives, all\nof them men who had been his companions on other adventures. He\nexplained the need for the vitrilene helmets and shields, and without\ncomment the six donned their armor and followed Bolton as he strode\ntoward the building. As they approached, a dull red glow could be\nplainly seen through the windows, and Dr. Bird paused and studied the\nphenomenon for a moment.\n\n\"I don't know what that means, Bolton,\" he said softly, \"but I don't\nlike the looks of it. Stanesky is up to some devilment or other. I\nwouldn't be a bit surprised to find out that he knows all about your\npickets and is ready for a raid.\"\n\n\"We'd better rush the place, then,\" muttered Bolton.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Bird nodded agreement and with a sharp command to his men Bolton\nbroke into a run. Not a shot was fired as they approached, and the\nfront door gave readily to Bolton's touch. At it opened there came a\ngrating sound from the roof followed by the whir of a propeller. Dr.\nBird ran out of the building and glanced up.\n\n\"A helicopter!\" he cried. \"They were expecting us and have escaped!\"\n\nHe drew his pistol and fired ineffectually at the great bird-like ship\nwhich was rising almost noiselessly into the air. He cursed and turned\nagain to the building.\n\nBolton still stood in the room which they had first entered. His\nflashlight showed it to be empty, but from under a door on the\nopposite side a line of dull red light glowed evilly. With his pistol\nready in his hand, Bolton approached the door on hands and knees.\nWhen he reached it he threw his shoulder against it and dropped flat\nto the floor as the door swung open. No shot greeted him, and he\nstared for a moment and then rose to his feet.\n\n\"Nothing in here but some glass statues,\" he announced.\n\nDr. Bird followed him into the room. As he looked at what Bolton had\ncalled glass statues he gasped and shielded his eyes.\n\n\"God in Heaven!\" he ejaculated. \"Those were living men!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBefore them were three men or what had been three men. All stood in\nstrained attitudes with a look of horror frozen on their faces. The\nthing that made the spectators shudder was that their bodies had, by\nsome diabolical method, been rendered semi-transparent. The dull red\nlight which suffused the room emanated from the three bodies. Dr. Bird\nexamined them closely, being careful not to touch them.\n\n\"The identity of my treacherous assistant is known,\" he said grimly as\nhe pointed at the middle figure. \"It was Gerond. What is this?\"\n\nHe took an envelope from the hand of the middle figure and opened it.\nA sheet of paper fell out and he picked it up and read it.\n\n\"My dear Mr. Bolton,\" ran the note. \"Your methods of tracing and\npicketing my headquarters are so crude as to be almost laughable. This\nbase has served its purpose and we were ready to abandon it in any\nevent, but I couldn't resist the temptation to let you almost nab us.\nThe three men whom you will find here are agents who failed in their\nduty. If you are interested in learning the method of their execution,\nyou might take to heart the words of your colleague, Dr. Bird: 'The\nclue lies in those windows.'\"\n\nCarnes glanced at the windows and gave a cry of surprise. The glass\nwas opaque, as had been the glass in the doctor's laboratory and the\nglass in the infirmary at Atlanta. The fogging however, was much more\npronounced, and the opaque glass gave faintly the same red effulgence\nwhich came from the three bodies.\n\n\"What does it mean, Doctor?\" he asked.\n\n\"I don't know, Carnes,\" said Dr. Bird slowly. \"I foresee that I am\ngoing to have to do a great deal of work on short wave-lengths soon.\nIt is doubtless the effect of some modification of the black lamp\nwhich has done it. Look out!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe leaped to one side as he spoke, drawing Bolton and Carnes with him.\nA panel in the side of the wall opposite the doorway had slid silently\nopen and through the opening poured out a beam of fiery red. Full on\nthe three bodies it fell, and then spread out to fill the room. Dr.\nBird had drawn the two nearest men out of the direct beam, but one of\nthe secret service men stood full in its path. In the excitement of\nentering he had dropped his vitrilene shield and the livid ray fell\nfull on his defenceless body. As they watched an expression of horror\nspread over his face and he strove to move to one side, but he was\nheld helpless. Slowly he stiffened; and, as the ray bored through him,\nhis body became semi-transparent and the same dull red glow which\nemanated from the three bodies they had found began to shine forth\nfrom him. Bolton strove to break from the doctor's grasp and rush to\nthe rescue but Dr. Bird held him with a grip of iron.\n\n\"Too late,\" he said grimly. \"Chalk up another murder to the arch fiend\nwho has committed the others. I don't know the nature of that ray and\nvitrilene may not be an adequate defence against its full force. We\nhad better get out of here and attack the place from the rear.\"\n\nCarefully edging their way around the sides of the room, the five men\nmade their way out through the door. Dr. Bird slammed the door shut\nbehind him and led the way out of the building and around to the\nrear. A door loomed before them and he cautiously tried it. It gave to\nhis touch and he entered. As he set his foot on the threshold a\nterrific explosion came from the interior of the building.\n\n\"Run!\" he shouted as he led the way in retreat. \"If that is a radite\nexplosion it will act for several seconds!\"\n\nFrom a safe distance they watched. One corner of the building had been\ntorn off by the force of the explosion, and as they watched the rest\nof the building gradually collapsed and sank into a pile of ruins.\n\n\"They had planned on a visit from us all right,\" said Dr. Bolton\ngrimly. \"They had a surprise for us any way we jumped. If we went in\nthe front door, that devil's ray was to finish us, and if we went in\nthe back door the whole place was arranged to blow up as we entered. I\nonly hope that Stanesky thinks that he has got us all and doesn't\nexpect an attack on his next base in the morning. If he doesn't, I\nthink we may give him a rather unpleasant surprise. Of course, that\nlamp is smashed into atoms and buried under the debris, but I don't\nknow what other devil's contraptions that ruin holds. Bolton, have\nyour men picket it and allow no one near until I get back. I've got to\nget to a telephone and get a couple of tanks from Meade and a plane or\ntwo from Langley Field.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwo tanks made their way slowly across country. The front of each tank\nwas protected by a heavy sheet of vitrilene, while from the turrets of\nthe tanks projected the wicked looking muzzles of thirty-seven\nmillimeter guns. Overhead two airplanes from Langley Field soared,\nscouting the country. Dr. Bird and Carnes rode in the leading tank.\n\n\"It ought to be somewhere near here, unless Karuska lied,\" said Carnes\nas he swept the country with a pair of binoculars.\n\n\"He didn't lie,\" returned Dr. Bird. \"It was his subconscious mind\nthat spoke and it never lies. He spoke of the gun emplacement as being\nin a swamp and I have a strong idea that it is submersible. Of course,\nit is bound to be well camouflaged, both from land and from air\nobservation.\"\n\nThe planes circled around again and again, quartering the air like a\npair of well-trained bird dogs will quarter a hunting field. First\nhigh and then low they swooped back and forth, the tanks lumbering\nslowly along in the same direction. Presently the occupants of the\nleading tank saw one of the planes bank sharply and swing around. It\ndropped to an altitude of only a few hundred feet and turned and went\nback over the ground it had just crossed.\n\n\"I believe that fellow sees something!\" exclaimed Carnes.\n\nAs he spoke, three green Very lights came from the cockpit of the\nplane. The tank driver gave a grunt of satisfaction and turned the\nnose of his vehicle in that direction. The second tank followed.\n\nHardly had they turned in the new direction before the ground began to\nget soft under their tracks and the heavy vehicles began to sink. The\ndriver of the Doctor's tank forced it ahead, but the tank sank deeper\nin the mire until water flowed in around the feet of the occupants.\n\n\"I reckon we'll have to get out and walk pretty soon, Doctor,\" said\nthe driver.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Bird grunted in acquiescence. The tank made its way forward a few\nyards before the engine sputtered and died. The second tank stopped\nwhen the first one did, fifty yards behind it. Donning vitrilene\nhelmets and taking vitrilene shields in their hands, the crews of both\ntanks climbed out into the waist-deep water and gathered around the\nDoctor for orders.\n\n\"Form a skirmish line at ten-pace intervals and cross the swamp,\" he\ndirected. \"We may meet with no opposition, but if there is, the more\nscattered we are, the safer we will be. You all have hand grenades as\nwell as your rifles?\"\n\nA murmur of assent answered him and the line formed and started across\nthe swamp. They had gone perhaps a hundred yards when three red lights\ncame from one of the planes circling overhead.\n\n\"Down!\" cried the doctor, dropping to his knees in the muck.\n\nFour hundred yards ahead of them a concrete platform emerged from the\nmarsh and rose slowly into the air. It was roofed with a dome of what\nlooked like plate glass, but which the doctor shrewdly suspected was\nvitrilene. When the base of the platform was two-feet above the level\nof the water the dome slid silently aside disclosing two men bending\nover a tiny gun. Dr. Bird leveled his binoculars.\n\n\"That's the Breslau gun model that was stolen as sure as I'm a foot\nhigh!\" he cried. \"They must have made some miniature shells and be\nplanning to fire it.\"\n\nSlowly a pall of intense blackness rose from the marsh and enveloped\nthe platform and hid it from view. A whining noise came from overhead,\nand then a crash like a thunderbolt. The blast of the explosion threw\nthe attackers face down in the swamp, and when they arose and looked\nback there was merely a gaping hole where the leading tank had been.\nThe second tank suddenly seemed to rise in the air and fly into\nmillions of tiny fragments, and a second thunderous blast sent them\nagain to their knees.\n\n\"Radite!\" bellowed Dr. Bird to Carnes. \"Imagine the effect if that had\nbeen a full charge fired from a completed Breslau gun! Watch the\nplanes, now. I think they are going to drop a few eggs on them.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe black mist cleared as if by magic and the platform was in plain\nview. The big glass dome rolled back into place as the two planes\nswept over at an elevation of two thousand feet. From each one a\nsmall black cigar-shaped object was released and fell in a long\nparabola toward the earth. The glass dome which had been closing over\nthe gun platform rolled quickly back and a long beam of intense\nblackness pierced the heavens. First one and then the other of the\nfalling bombs disappeared from view into it, and then the black column\nfaded from view. The two bombs fell with increasing speed but the dome\nclosed over the platform before they struck. The two hit the dome at\nalmost the same instant and instead of the blinding crash they\nexpected, the watchers saw the bombs rebound from the dome and fall\nharmlessly into the water.\n\n\"Stymied!\" muttered the doctor. \"I wonder what other properties that\nconfounded lamp has.\"\n\nHe resumed his advance, Carnes and the soldiers keeping abreast of\nhim. When they were within two hundred yards of the platform it rose\nagain and the transparent dome rolled back. A beam of black shot forth\nover the swamp, searching them out and hiding them from view. First\none and then another felt the effects of the black beam; but the\nvitrilene which the Doctor had provided stood them in good stead, and,\naside from a slight shortening of their breath, none of the attackers\nfelt any the worse.\n\n\"Come on, men!\" cried the Doctor as his athletic figure plowed forward\nthrough the breast-deep water. \"That is their worst weapon and it is\nharmless against us!\"\n\nCheering, they fought their way toward the platform. It sunk for a\nmoment and then rose again. As the dome swung back a sharp crackle of\nmachine-gun fire sounded and the water before them was whipped into\nfoam by the plunging bullets. One of the soldiers gave a sharp cry and\nslumped forward into the water.\n\n\"Fire at will!\" shouted the lieutenant in command.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA crackle of rifle fire answered the tattoo of the machine-gun, and\nthe sharp ping of bullets striking on the dome could be plainly heard.\nAn occasional shot kicked up a spurt of white dust from the concrete,\nbut the machine-gun kept up a steady rattle of fire and the soldiers\nkept their heads almost at the level of the water. There came the roar\nof an airplane motor, and one of the planes swept over the platform, a\nhundred yards in the air, with two machine-guns spraying streams of\nbullets onto the platform. Two men abandoned their machine-gun and\ncrouched under the partially folded-back dome as the second plane\nswept over, and Dr. Bird took advantage of the lull to advance his\nparty a few yards nearer. Again the defenders of the platform rushed\nto their gun, but the first plane had turned and swooped down with\nboth guns going, and again they were forced to take shelter while the\nDoctor and his force made another advance.\n\nThe second plane had turned and followed the first, but the defenders\nhad had enough. The transparent dome closed over them and the platform\nsank into the marsh. With a shout, Dr. Bird led the way forward again.\n\nThe attackers were within a hundred yards of the platform when it\nagain rose above the surface of the water. The guns had disappeared,\nbut in their place stood an airship. It was a small affair with stubby\nwings above which were two helicopter blades revolving at high speed.\nNo sound of a motor could be heard.\n\nThe transparent dome rolled back and like a bullet the little craft\nshot into the air, followed by a futile volley from the soldiers.\nHardly had it appeared than the two airplanes bore down on it with\nmachine-guns going. The helicopter paid no attention to them for a\nmoment, and then came a puff of smoke from its side. The leading plane\nswerved sharply and the helicopter fired again. The leading plane\nmaneuvered about, trying to get a machine-gun to bear, while the\nsecond plane climbed swiftly to get above the helicopter and pour a\ndeadly stream of fire down into it. It gained position and swooped\ndown to the attack, but another puff of smoke came from the side of\nthe helicopter and there was a thunderous report and a blinding flash\nin the sky. As the smoke cleared away, no trace of the ill-fated plane\ncould be seen. The helicopter hung motionless in the air as though\ndaring the remaining plane to attack.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe plane accepted the challenge and bore down at full speed on the\nstranger. Again came a puff of smoke, but the plane swerved and an\nanswering shot came from its side. It was above the helicopter, and\nthe shell which missed its mark plunged to the ground. When it struck\nthere came a roar and a flash and the whole earth seemed to shake. The\nhelicopter shot upward into the air and forward, both its elevating\nfans and its propellers whirling blurs of light. The airplane followed\nat its sharpest climbing angle, but was helpless to compete with its\nswifter climbing rival.\n\n\"He's got away!\" groaned Carnes.\n\n\"Not yet, old dear!\" cried the Doctor hopping with excitement. \"He\nisn't safe yet. I never told you, but one Breslau gun had been made\nand it is on that plane. It has deadly accuracy and is good for\nfifteen miles. That's Lieutenant Dreen at the controls and Mason at\nthe gun.\"\n\nAs he spoke the plane swung around and made a half loop. For a few\nyards it flew upside down and then whirled swiftly. As it turned there\ncame a sharp report and a puff of smoke from its rear cockpit. High\nabove, the helicopter had ceased climbing and hovered motionless. As\nthe plane fired, the helicopter shot forward like an arrow from a bow,\nand thereby spelled its doom. Not for nothing did Captain Mason bear\nthe title of the best aerial gunner in the Air Corps. He had foreseen\nwhat the action of his opponent would be and had allowed for just such\na move. Far up in the sky came a blinding flash and a cloud of smoke.\nWhen the smoke cleared the sky was empty, except for a little\nscattered debris falling slowly to the ground.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"And that's that!\" exclaimed Dr. Bird as he finished his examination\nof the underground laboratory with which the gun platform connected.\n\"The lamp has gone to glory with Breslau's gun model and two of the\nbest brains of the Young Labor party. I am sure that Stanesky was one\nof those two men. I wish the whole gang had been on board.\"\n\n\"Don't you think that this is the end of it, Doctor?\" asked Carnes.\n\n\"No, Carnes, I don't. We know that the real brains of this outfit is\nSaranoff, and Saranoff is still alive. He probably won't try to use\nhis black lamp again, because I will have a defence against it in a\nshort time, now that I have seen it in action, but he'll try something\nelse. The whole object of life to a loyal citizen of Bolshevikia is to\nreduce the whole world to the barbarous level in which they hold\nRussia, and they will spare no pains or effort to accomplish it. The\ngreatest obstacle to their success at present is the President of the\nUnited States. He is loved and respected by the whole world, and if he\nis spared he will forge the world into a great machine for the\npreservation of peace and universal good will. That would be fatal to\nBolshevikia's plans, and they will spare no effort to remove him. By\nthe grace of God, we have saved him from harm so far, but until we\nremove Saranoff permanently from the scene, I will never feel safe for\nhim.\"\n\n\"What do you suppose they'll try next, Doctor?\"\n\n\"That, Carnes, time alone will tell.\"\n\n\n\n\nPhalanxes of Atlans\n\nBEGINNING A TWO-PART NOVEL\n\n_By F. V. W. Mason_\n\n[Illustration: _Agile as grasshoppers, those fierce war dogs ripped\nand worried their prey._]\n\n[Sidenote: Only in dim legends did mankind remember Atlantis and the\nLost Tribes--until Victor Nelson's extraordinary adventure in the\nunknown arctic.]\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nThe ice suddenly gave way under his foot, hurling Victor Nelson\nviolently forward to lie in the deep snow at the bottom of a tiny\ncrevasse, down which the merciless gale moaned like an anguished\ndemon.\n\n\"It's no use,\" he muttered bitterly. \"We've fought hard, but we're\ndone for.\"\n\nHe lay still, stupidly watching his breath form tiny beads of ice on\nthe ends of the fur which lined his parka. Until that moment he had\nnot realized how thoroughly exhausted he was. Every muscle of his\nstarved, bruised body ached unbearably. It wasn't so bad lying there\nin the soft snow. He could rest, then look later for the ice hummock\nbehind which the plane lay sheltered. Rest! That's what he needed, a\ngood long rest.\n\nBut deep within him, a primal instinct stabbed his waning\nconsciousness. \"No,\" he gasped, and blinked his reddened eyes behind\nsmoked goggles which dulled the shimmer of the aurora. \"If I stop,\nI'll never get up.\"\n\nShaken by the terrific velocity of the arctic gale he numbly clambered\nto his feet, then stooped with a stiff awkward motion to retrieve a\nWinchester rifle which lay half buried in the snow beside the blurred\nimprint of his body.\n\n\"Wonder if Alden had any better luck?\" The question burned dully in\nhis brain. \"Don't suppose so; there can't be anything alive in this\nGod-awful wilderness.\" As he stumbled on he found no answer in an\nunbroken vista of wind-scored ice and drifting snow that, swirling\nhigh into the air, momentarily cut off the view of that black line of\nice-capped mountains barely visible on the horizon.\n\n\"Yes, if he hasn't found anything, we'll be dead or frozen stiff\nbefore to-morrow.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis soul--that of a true explorer--revolted, not at the thought of\ndeath, but that his and Alden's courageously won discovery of a\nmajestic mountain range towering high over a polar region marked\n\"unexplored\" on the maps would now never be made public.\n\nLeaning forward against the merciless icy blast he painfully picked\nhis way over a treacherous ice ridge, to be faintly encouraged by the\nfact that the towerlike hummock of ice marking the position of the\nplane now lay but a few hundred yards ahead.\n\nBitterly he cursed that demon of ill-fortune who had sent the blinding\nsnow storm which had forced down the plane ten long days ago at the\nvery beginning of its triumphant return flight to the base at Cape\nRichards. Since that hour the storm gods had emptied the vials of\ntheir wrath upon the luckless explorers. Day after day, cyclonic winds\nmade all thought of a take-off suicidal in the extreme. Three days\nago the last of their food had given out, and, he mused, starvation is\nan ill companion for despair.\n\nSlip, slide and fall! On he fought until the final barrier was reached\nand he stood staring hopelessly down into a small natural amphitheater\nwhich sheltered the great monoplane. The ship was still there, its\nengine snugged in a canvas shroud and with the soft, dry snow banked\nup high in the lee of its silver gray fuselage. Numbly, like a man in\nthe grip of a painful coma, Nelson shielded his face with a furry hand\nto scan the surrounding terrain. \"Hell!\" The door block of the igloo\nthey had built was still snowed up; Alden was not there!\n\n\"He's not back,\" he muttered, while his body swayed beneath the gale\nwhich smote him with fierce, unseen fists. \"Poor devil, I hope he\nhasn't lost the way.\"\n\nAll the bitterness of undeserved defeat stung his soul as he started\ndown the incline into the hollow.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuddenly he paused. The rifle flew into the ready position and his\nchilled thumb drew back the hammer. \"What's this?\" On the snow at his\nfeet was a bright, scarlet splash, dreadfully distinct against the\nwhite background. While his dazed brain struggled to register what his\neyes saw, he looked to the right and left and discovered several more\nof the hideous spots. Then an object that gleamed dully in the polar\ntwilight attracted his attention. He lumbered forward, stooped stiffly\nand caught up a long, half round strip of bronze.\n\n\"What? Why? Oh--I'm crazy. I'm seeing things!\" The pain in his empty\nstomach was now becoming excruciating. To steady himself he shut his\neyes, shook his head as though to clear it, then looked again at that\nstrip of metal in his hand. Attached to it were two slender strips of\nleather like straps, ending in small, bronze buckles.\n\n\"Why, it's not from the plane,\" he stammered aloud. \"Damned if it\ndoesn't look like a greave the old Greek warriors used to wear to\nprotect their shins.\"\n\nSuddenly alarmed and mystified beyond words, he shuffled forward over\nthe snow, the greave yet clutched in a fur gloved hand. Presently two\nmore objects, already half buried by the stinging, swirling drifts,\ncaught his attention. One was the stock of Alden's rifle, protruding\nstarkly brown from the unrelieved whiteness, and the other was a\nbroken wooden shaft that ended a graceful but wickedly sharp bronze\nspear head.\n\n\"I've either gone crazy,\" he said, \"or I'm delirious. Yes, I must be\nclean nutty! There _couldn't_ be a human settlement within a thousand\nmiles. Let's see what's happened.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the snow of a little wind-sheltered space behind the igloo he\ndiscovered the unmistakable and ominous signs of a struggle. An\nindefinite number of footprints, blurred but enormous in size, were\nmarked in the snow. Here and there deep furrows mutely testified how\nAlden and the enemies against whom he struggled had reeled back and\nforth in vicious combat over a considerable area. Then, shaken by a\nnew fear, he discovered Alden's left glove and a rag of some peculiar\nthick material that seemed to have a metallic finish. But what aroused\nhis gravest fears were the numerous splashes of blood that here and\nthere streaked the snow in gruesome relief.\n\nOnly a moment Nelson stood, shaken by the merciless wind, scanning the\npiece of bronzed armor between his gloved hands with a fresh interest.\nIt was beautifully fashioned, and decorated at the knee point with the\nwonderfully wrought figure of a dolphin.\n\nIf he could only think clearly! But his brain seemed to lie in a\nred-hot skull. \"Whatever's happened,\" he muttered, \"I'd better not\nwaste time; they couldn't have been here so long ago. Poor Alden! I\nwonder what kind of devils caught him?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEven before he had finished the sentence the aviator had taken up the\npartially obliterated trail of spattered blood drops. That what he\nsought appeared to be a maraudering party of giants restrained him not\nat all. The one clear thought burning in his weary brain was that\nRichard Alden, his best friend--the man with whom he had traveled over\nhalf the world, by whose side he had faced many a perilous\nsituation--must at that moment lie in peril, the extent of which he\ncould only surmise.\n\n\"Must have been about a dozen of them,\" he said thickly. And, holding\nthe Winchester ready, he commenced once more to plod on through the\nstinging sheets of wind-driven ice particles. More than once he had\ngreat difficulty in not losing that crimson trail, for here and there\nthe restless, white crystals completely blotted out the splashes.\n\nAll at once Nelson checked his pathetically slow progress, finding\nhimself on the top of an eminence, looking down in what appeared to be\na vastly deep natural amphitheater of snow and ice. At the bottom, and\nperhaps a hundred yards distant, was a curious black oval from which\nappeared to rise a dense, wind-whipped column of whitish vapor.\n\n\"My eyes must be going back on me,\" muttered Nelson through stiffened\nlips. How intolerably heavy his fur suit seemed! His strength was\nabout gone and that curious black mouthlike circle seemed infinitely\nfar away. But, spurred by fears for his friend, he started downward\nfor the precipitious trail leading directly towards it.\n\nOnce he stepped inside the crater, he became conscious of a terrific\nside pressure which gripped him as a whirlpool seizes a luckless\nswimmer. The wind buffetted him from all angles, dealing him powerful\nblows on face and body, which, too strong for his weary body, sent him\nreeling weakly, drunkenly across the hard, glare ice towards the\nvortex. Twice he slipped, each time finding it harder to arise. But\nat last he approached what on closer inspection proved to be a\nsubterranean vent of black rock.\n\n\"Steam!\" he gasped. \"It's steam coming out of there!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSwayed by a dozen conflicting emotions, he paused, the Winchester\nbarrel wavering like a reed in his enfeebled grasp.\n\n\"The whole thing's crazy,\" he decided. \"I must be frozen and lying\nsomewhere, delirious. Poor Dick! Can't help him much now.\"\n\nLike a man in a nightmare who advances but feels nothing under his\nfeet, Nelson staggered on towards that huge, gaping aperture of black\nrock. On the threshold a pool of melted snow water made him stare.\n\n\"Hell!\" he said. \"It's only a volcanic vent of some kind.\" Then dimly\ncame the recollection of Eskimo legends concerning thermal springs\nbeyond the desolate and unknown reaches of Grant Land.\n\nHis mind in an indescribable turmoil, Nelson splashed across a hundred\nyards of sodden snow, then shivered on wading knee deep through a pool\nof melted ice. Now he stood on the very threshold of that awful\nopening, dense clouds of vapor beating warmly against his chilled\nfeatures.\n\nHis goggles fogged at once, blinding him effectively as, with reason\nstaggering under the accumulated stress of starvation and the\ncircumstances of Alden's disappearance, he groped his way a few feet\ninto the vent. With his left hand he pulled up the glasses from his\nsunken, blood-shot eyes.\n\n\"It's warm, by God!\" he cried in astonishment as the skin exposed by\nlifting the goggles came in contact with the air. \"Must be some kind\nof earth-warmed cave.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIncreasingly mystified, he caught up his rifle and strode on down the\npassage, at that moment illuminated by the last unearthly rays of the\naurora borealis. A single, dazzling beam played before him like a\npowerful searchlight, to light a high vaulted tunnel of basalt rocks\nwhich were distorted by some long-gone convulsion of the earth into a\nhundred weird cleavages and faults. For that brief instant he found he\ncould see perhaps a hundred feet down into a high roofed passage,\nalong the top of which poured a tremendous stream of billowing,\nwrithing steam.\n\n\"If this doesn't beat all,\" he murmured; but for all of his\napprehension he did not pause. Those bloody splashes bespeaking\nAlden's pressing need urged him on. \"Looks like I'm taking a one way\ntrip into Hell itself. Well, we'll soon see.\"\n\nSlipping and sliding over an almost impassable array of black rocks\nand boulders, Nelson fought his way forward, conscious that with every\nstride the air grew damper and warmer. Soon trickles of sweat were\npouring down over his chest, tickling unbearably.\n\nThen all at once the ray of light faded, leaving him immersed in a\nblackness equalled only by the gloom of a subterranean vault. He\nstopped and, resting his rifle against a nearby invisible rock, threw\nback the parka hood and pulled off his gloves. He was amazed to feel\nhow warm the strong air current was on his hands.\n\n\"Beats all,\" he muttered heavily. \"I wonder where they've taken\nAlden?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMeanwhile his hands groped through fur garments now wet with\nmelted-snow and ice particles, searching for the catch to open that\npocket in which lay a small but powerful electric flashlight, an\ninstrument without which no far-flying aviator finds himself. After a\nmoment's fumbling, his yet stiffened fingers encountered the\ncylindrical flash and, with a low cry of satisfaction, he drew it\nforth to press the button.\n\n\"Mighty useful. I--\" The words stopped, frozen on his lips. Before the\nparka edge his close cropped hair seemed to rise, and his breath\nstopped midway in his lungs. Sharp electric shocks shook him, for\nthere, half revealed in the feeble flashlight's glare, was a sight\nwhich shook his sanity to the snapping point. Not fifty feet away two\neyes, large as dinner plates, with narrow vertical red irises, were\ntrained on him. Rooted to the ground by the paralysis of utter horror,\nNelson saw that their color was a weird, unhealthy, greenish white,\nrather like the color of a radio-light watch dial.\n\nStrangely intense, these huge orbs wavered not at all, filling him\nwith an unnameable dread, while the strong odor of musk assailed his\nnostrils. The flashlight slipped from between Nelson's fingers and, no\nlonger having his thumb on the button, flickered out.\n\nHelpless, Nelson stood transfixed against a boulder, aware that the\nstrange, musky scent was becoming stronger. Then to his ears came a\ndry scrabbling as of some large body stealthily advancing. Those\nhorrible, unearthly eyes were coming nearer! Fierce, terrible shocks\nof fear gripped the exhausted aviator. Then the impulse of\nself-preservation, that most elementary of all instincts, forced him\nto snatch up the rifle, to sight hastily, blindly, between those two,\ngreat greenish eyes. Choking out a strangled sob of desperation,\nNelson made his trembling finger close over the cold strip of steel\nthat must be the trigger.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLike a stage trick, the cavern was momentarily lit by a strong, orange\nyellow glare. Then the Winchester's report thundered and roared\ndeafeningly; coincidentally arose a nerve-shattering scream. An\nexhalation, foul as a corpse long unburied, fanned his face.\nTerrified, he flattened to the rock wall as a huge, though dangerously\nagile body hurtled by with the speed of a runaway horse. Presently\nfollowed the sound of a ponderous fall, then a series of shrill,\near-piercing gibberings and squeakings, like those of a titanic\nrat--squeaks that rang like the chorus of Hell itself. Gradually they\ngrew fainter, while in the darkness the heavy air of the tunnel became\nrank with the odor of clotting blood.\n\nNelson remained where he was, shaking like a frightened horse and\nbathed with a cold sweat.\n\n\"Wonder what it was?\" he muttered numbly.\n\nHe broke off, for in the terrible darkness sounded a low but perfectly\naudible _thud! thud! thud! thud!_--and also the subtle noise of some\nrough surface rasping gently over the stone. His nerves crisped and\nshrieked for relief.\n\n\"It's coming again!\" he told himself, and ejected the spent cartridge\nfrom the Winchester. \"No use--it'll get me, but I may as well fight as\nlong as I can.\"\n\nEven stronger grew the musty smell of blood while that uncanny _thud!\nthud!_ sound continued at regular intervals. Nelson waited, breath\nhalted and finger on trigger, but still the darkness yielded no\nglimpse of those awful saucer-like eyes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEmboldened, he stooped and, jerking off his left glove, commenced to\ngrope among the boulders. Somewhere near at his feet the flashlight\nmust be lying. Hoping against hope that its fall had not shattered the\nbulb, he ran his fingers over the cold, damp stones, every instant\nexpecting to feel the clutch of the unseen monster. How tiny, how puny\nhe was! All at once his fingers encountered the smooth familiar shape\nof the flash and he raised it cautiously through the darkness.\nPatiently he shifted the Winchester to his left hand in order to set\nthe flashlight on the top of a flat rock, pointing it as nearly as he\ncould determine in the direction from whence came those ominous,\nstealthy sounds.\n\n\"Guess I'll switch on the light,\" he decided, \"and trust to drop\nwhatever it is before it reaches me.\"\n\nTaking a fresh grip on his quivering nerves, Nelson cautiously cocked\nthe .38-55, cuddled the familiar stock to his shoulder. He sighted,\nthen with his right hand pushed down the catch lever of the\nflashlight.\n\nInstantly a dazzling white beam shot forth to shatter the gloom. The\nhair on the back of Nelson's hands itched unbearably, while the cold\nfingers of madness clutched at his brain, for the sight which met his\neyes all but bereft him of his wavering sanity. There, belly up,\nacross a low ridge of basalt, lay a hideous reptile, which in form\nfaintly resembled an enormous and fantastic kangaroo. Its scabby belly\nwas of the unhealthy yellow of a grub, a hue which gave way to a\nleaden gray as the wart-covered skin reached the back. Two enormous\nhind legs, each thick as a man's torso and each equipped with three\ndagger-like talons, struck out in helpless fury at the air, while a\nlong, lizard-like tail threshed powerfully back and forth, scattering\nponderous boulders right and left as though they had been marbles. The\nflashlight being trained as it was, the monster's head and\nforequarters were invisible, all save two very much smaller and\nshorter front legs which, like the hinder ones, clawed spasmodically.\n\n\"The D. T's!\" gasped Nelson, conscious that he was trembling like an\naspen. He suppressed a wild desire to laugh. \"Yes, I've gone crazy!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe glanced downwards and leaped swiftly back, for, creeping over the\nstones towards his fur outer boots, meandered a wide rivulet of bright\nscarlet blood. From its surface rose small curling feathers of steam\nwhich, drifting towards the tunnel's roof, merged with that gray,\nvaporous current flowing steadily towards the sunless Arctic expanse\noutside.\n\nIt took Nelson a long five minutes to sufficiently recover his\nequilibrium for action. All he could do was to stare at that\ngrotesque, gargoyle-like creature as it writhed in leisurely and\npersistent death throes.\n\n\"Guess I winged it all right! My God, what a nasty beast! Looks like\none of those allosaurs I read about in college. It couldn't be,\nthough--that tribe of dinosaurs died out five million years ago.\"\n\nCautiously he scrambled around among the high black stones, casting\nthe search light beams before him and holding the Winchester always\nready in his hand while trying to recall snatches of palaeontology\nstudied at college long years ago.\n\n\"Yes, it must be a survival of one of the carnivorous dinosaurs,\" he\ndecided, then paused, increasingly conscious of that steady thudding\nnoise. What caused it?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt last he found himself before the creature's gigantic and repulsive\nhead which lay limp over a blood bathed stone, huge jaws partially\nopen, and serrated rows of wicked, stiletto-sharp teeth gleaming\nyellowly in the flashlight's rays. The head in shape was bullet-like,\nending in a blunt nose as big as a bushel basket and in two prominent\nnostrils. The green, lidless eyes were still open, shining faintly,\nand seemed to follow his movements, but the steaming blood poured with\nthe force of a small hose from between triple row of bayonetlike teeth\nthat curved inward like those of a shark, to splash and bubble freely\nto the rock floor and to dribble horribly over the warty, gray hide.\n\nThen Nelson discovered an amazing fact. About the great scaly neck,\nthick as a boy's waist, was fastened a ponderous collar, set with\nshort, sharp spikes.\n\nNelson gasped. \"What in hell!\" he cried. \"This damn thing's somebody's\nproperty!\" His mind, staggered at the thought of dealing with a race\nthat could and would domesticate such a hideous monster. \"Well, it's\nno use standing here,\" he muttered, wiping the sweat from his eyes.\n\"This isn't getting poor Alden away from those devils.\"\n\n_Thud! thud!_ In the act of turning he paused, listened once more.\nThen he discovered to his amazement that the heart of the apparently\ndead reptile was still beating strongly. He could even see the yellow\nskin of its belly rise and fall. The effect was grotesque, uncanny.\n\n\"Of course,\" muttered the shaken aviator, \"I'd forgotten a reptile's\nganglions will keep on beating for hours, like that shark we killed\noff Paumotu. Its heart didn't stop for five hours.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLeaving the slain allosaurus behind, the aviator limped onwards,\ndoggedly following a trail which wound down, ever onwards, into the\ndepths of the earth. Gradually the air became so filled with steam\nthat he stripped off his fur jumper and trousers. Clad in a khaki\nflannel shirt, serge trousers and shoepacks, he paused long enough to\ncount his cartridges, and found there were just fourteen. Hell! Not\nvery many with which to venture into an unknown abyss. He distributed\nthem in his pockets, and, somewhat relieved of the weight of the fur\nsuit, took up his advance, playing the flashlight ahead of him as he\nwent.\n\n\"Poor Alden,\" he thought. \"I wonder if he's still alive?\"\n\nEvery moment expecting to stumble over the mangled corpse of his\nfriend he hurried on, making better time over the cavern floor, but\nsoon even the lighter clothing commenced to feel oppressive.\n\n\"Must be the earth's heat,\" he muttered, while the steam clouds rolled\nby him like ghostly serpents. \"Guess the crust is very thin\nhere--something like Yellowstone. Probably I'll find some thermal\nsprings ahead.\"\n\nJust as he spoke the tunnel took a sharp turn to the right. He\nscrambled around the bend to stand petrified, for with the suddenness\nof lightning a flood of dazzling orange-red light sprang into being.\nMomentarily it blinded him, then revealed strange, incomprehensible\nscenes. It appeared that two short shafts of incandescent flame\nroared through transparent columns of glass on either side of the\npassage some fifty yards distant. Subconsciously Nelson realized that\nthese columns began and ended in stonework that was smooth and well\njoined.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs his eyes became accustomed to the glare he distinguished beside\neach light pillar two bronze doors, some eight feet high and\nsemicircular in shape. These had been evidently pulled back to expose\nthe lights. Then his breath stopped in his throat, for there, standing\nbeside them, was a gleaming group of six or eight of the strangest\ncreatures Nelson could ever have imagined. They were men--there was no\nmistaking that--men of normal size, but they were so helmeted and\nincased in a curious type of armor that for a moment he believed them\ngargoyles.\n\nQuite motionless he stood, clutching the cold barrel of the Winchester\nin a spasmodic grip and staring up at those two watch-towers, built\nlike gigantic swallows' nests into sheer rock wall. He could see the\nwarriors stationed there, peering curiously down at him from the\ndepths of heavy, bronze helmets--helmets which in shape much resembled\nthose of an ancient Grecian hoplite, for the nose guards and cheek\npieces descended so low as to completely mask the features of those\nstrange guards. For crests these helmets bore exquisitely wrought\nbronze dolphins, with brilliant blue eyes of sapphire. But what\nfascinated Nelson most was the curious armor they wore. Beneath breast\nplates of polished bronze, these strange warriors wore what seemed to\nbe a kind of chain mail--yet it was not that, for the texture had more\nthe appearance of some heavy but pliant leather, finished with a\nmetallic surfacing.\n\nSuddenly the spell of mutual amazement was broken, for a tall warrior\nin a breast plate that glittered with diamonds and seemed altogether\nmore ornate than the rest, clapped a short brass horn to his lips and\nblew a single piercing note. At once there appeared on the tunnel's\nfloor, not a hundred yards from the startled aviator, a rank of\nperhaps twenty soldiers, accoutred exactly like those he beheld by the\nlight boxes. They came scrambling over the boulders, their shadows\ngrotesquely preceding them. In their hands were long shafted spears,\nand on their left arms rectangular shields, charged with a lively\ndolphin in the act of swimming. Some of them, however, held short\nhoses in their hands, hoses that sprouted from tight brass coils\nstrapped to their broad shoulders.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAgain the commanding figure aloft raised the horn. From the tail of\nhis eye Nelson caught the gleam of metal in the orange glare. While a\nblast, harsh as the scream of a fire siren, echoed and re-echoed\neerily through the passage, there appeared a fresh detachment. Nelson\nshrank back in horror, for these bronze-armored warriors led, at the\nend of a powerful chain, two more of those huge, ferocious allosaurs,\nexactly like the one he had slain but a short while back.\n\nLike well regulated automatons the hoplite rank opened to permit the\npassage of those repulsive, eager monsters, then closed up again and\nhalted, spears levelled before them in the precise manner of an\nancient Grecian phalanx, while the men with those curious hose-like\ncontrivances ran out to guard the flanks.\n\n\"I'm done for now,\" thought Nelson as he threw off the Winchester's\nsafety catch. \"I suppose they'll turn those nightmares loose on me.\"\n\nHe was right. For all the world as though they led war dogs, the\nkeepers in brazen armor advanced, the dull metallic clank of their\naccoutrement clearly discernible above the sibilant hiss of their\nhideous charges, which hopped along grotesquely like kangaroos, using\ntheir long and powerful tails as a counterpoise.\n\nThen the officer watching from the left hand swallow's nest shouted a\nhoarse, unintelligible command, whereupon one of the keepers raised\nhis right hand in a sharp gesture that instantly flattened the\nincredible monster to earth, exactly like an obedient bird dog.\n\nAs in a fantastic dream Nelson watched one of the armored guardians\nunsnap the hook of the powerful chain by which his allosaurus was\nsecured. Then, whistling sharply, he clapped his hands and pointed\nstraight at the motionless aviator. The creature's green white eyes\nflickered back and forth, and a chill, colder than the outer Arctic,\ninvaded Nelson's breast as those unearthly eyes came to rest upon him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMeanwhile the other allosaurus remained crouched, whining impatiently\nfor its keepers to cast it loose.\n\nFixing burning eyes upon the American, the foremost keeper threw back\nhis head. \"Ahre-e-e!\" he shouted. Instantly the freed allosaurus\narose, balanced its enormous bulk, then commenced to leap forward at\ntremendous speed, clearing fifteen or twenty feet with each jump and\nuttering a curious, whistling scream as it bore down, a terrifying\nvision of gleaming teeth and talons.\n\nShaking off the paralysis of despair, Nelson whipped up the Winchester\nand, as before, sighted squarely between those blazing, gemlike eyes.\nWhen the huge monster was but twenty feet away he fired, and the\nreport thundered and banged in the cavern like the crash of a summer\nstorm. In mid-air the ghastly carnivore teemed to stagger. Its tail\ntwitched sharply as in an effort to recover its balance. Then, quite\nlike any normal creature that is shot through the head, it lost all\nsense of direction and made great convulsive leaps, around and around,\nclawing madly at the air, bumping into the rock walls and uttering\nsoul-shaking shrieks of agony. Like a gargoyle gone mad it reeled back\ntowards the startled rank of spearmen. As it came, Nelson saw the\nsecond allosaurus rear itself backwards and, balanced on its tail,\nstrike out with powerful hind legs as its maddened fellow drew near.\n\nLike razors the great talons ripped through the dying allosaurus'\nbelly, exposing the gray-red intestines as the stricken creature raced\nby, snapping crazily at the empty air.\n\nA single mighty sweep of the monster's tail crushed five or six of the\npanic-stricken keepers and guards, strewing them like broken and\nabandoned marionettes among the stones. Hissing and obviously\nterrified, the second dinosaur watched the dying struggles of its\nmate; then, obedient to a terrified shout from its keepers, wheeled\nabout to join in a frantic rout of the spearmen, who, casting aside\nshield, spear and brass coil, fled for dear life in the direction of\nthose invisible passages through which they had appeared.\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nNo less amazed and alarmed than those vanished soldiers, Nelson\nremained rooted to the ground, conscious that in the swallow's nest\noverhead there remained only the officer--a tall, broad shouldered man\nwith golden beard showing from under the cheek pieces of his helmet.\nAcross the body of the still writhing monster their glances met.\nNelson could see by the light of those strange pillars of fire that\nthe other's eyes were blue as any Norseman's. Leaning far out over the\nstone parapet the other stared down upon the aviator from the depths\nof his jewelled helmet in a strange mixture of curiosity and awe.\n\nSuddenly Nelson's nerves snapped and he shook a trembling fist at the\nmartial figure above.\n\n\"Go away!\" he shrieked, and reeled back on the edge of collapse. \"Go\naway, you damn phantom! You're driving me crazy--crazy, I tell you!\"\n\nThe other stiffened, then turned and, uttering a hoarse shout,\nvanished, leaving the noiseless and apparently heatless pillar of fire\nflaring steadily.\n\nRecovering somewhat, Nelson set his teeth, advanced to the nearest\ncorpse, stooped and regarded him who lay there, with bronze helmet\nfallen off.\n\n\"It's a man and not a ghost,\" he murmured as his finger encountered\nflesh that was still warm. \"Red headed too, or I'm a liar. Now what in\nhell is all this?\"\n\nFor all his bewilderment he began to feel better and his swaying\nreason became steadier. \"Bronze, bronze--nothing but bronze,\" the\naviator told himself as he further examined the scattered equipment.\n\"Evidently these fellows don't know the use of iron or steel.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith increased curiosity he bent over another splendidly built dead\nman who lay with back broken and sightless eyes staring fixedly onto\nthe steam current meandering silently along the cavern's roof. From\nthe fallen man's belt were slung half a dozen curious weapons that\nlooked not unlike potato mashers, except that they were bronze headed\nand had wooden handles.\n\n\"Hum,\" he commented, \"kind of like the grenades the Boche used in the\nlate lamented. Wonder what the devil these are?\"\n\nSuddenly his ear detected the sound of a footstep and, on looking\nswiftly up, he beheld that same yellow bearded officer who had\ndirected the attack. This strange being had taken off his ponderous\nhelmet to carry it in his left hand, while his right was held\nvertically in the immemorial sign of peace. On he came with powerful\nmartial strides, a brilliant green cloak flapping gently behind him\nand the jewels in his brazen armor glinting like so many tiny colored\neyes. The stranger was indeed handsome, Nelson noticed--and then he\nreceived perhaps the greatest shock of the whole chimerical adventure.\nThe gold bearded man halted some twenty feet away, smiled and spoke in\na curiously inflected but perfectly recognizable voice.\n\n\"Welcome to the Empire of the Atlans. Prithee, Wanderer, what be thy\nname?\"\n\nFor a long moment Nelson was entirely too taken back to make a reply.\nDesperately his already perplexed brain tried to comprehend. Here was\na handsome six-footer, dressed in the arms of an ancient race,\nspeaking English of the seventeenth century!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs at a phantom, he regarded the stalwart, faintly ominous figure,\nfrom heavy leather sandals to bronze greaves, thence to wide belt from\nwhich dangled more of those curious grenadelike objects. His glance\npaused on the officer's beautifully wrought bronze cuirasse or breast\nplate which showed in relief an emerald scaled dolphin and trident.\nThese, Nelson decided, must be the national emblems of this\nincomprehensible nation.\n\nThen their eyes met, held each other a long moment until the tall\nofficer's features, disfigured by a long red scar across the jaw,\nbroke into a hard smile.\n\n\"Hero Giles Hudson begs thy pardon,\" he said, \"but methought thou\nspoke in the language of Sir Henry Hudson, my ancestor?\"\n\n\"Sir Henry Hudson!\" stammered Nelson incredulously. \"The old explorer\nwhose men turned him adrift? So that's why you're talking embalmed\nEnglish!\" In desperation his weary brain strove to understand.\n\n\"I know naught,\" replied the other with a grave smile, \"save that the\nfounder of our royal line spoke what he called English. He came from\nthe Ice World to rule wisely over Atlans. He was the greatest\nAtlantean of history.\"\n\n\"Atlantean?\" echoed Nelson, while his mind groped frantically in the\nrecess of his memory. \"Atlans, Atlantis!\" A great light broke upon\nhim. \"The lost Atlantis! Great God!\" Had he stumbled upon a remnant of\nthat powerful people whose fabled empire had been drowned ten\ncenturies ago in the cold waves of the Atlantic?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Aye,\" the yellow haired warrior continued as though reading his\nthoughts, \"long centuries ago this valley was peopled by those who\nescaped the great cataclysm which ended the mother country. Later came\nanother race, barbarian wanderers like thyself.\" He bowed for all the\nworld like a courtly English gentleman. \"But methinks thou art in need\nof food and sustenance?\"\n\n\"You bet I'm hungry,\" was Nelson's emphatic reply. \"I'm one short jump\nof starvation and the D. T.'s. But hold on a minute,\" he cried. \"I'm\nlooking for a friend of mine. He went by here, didn't he?\"\n\n\"Aye.\" A crafty expression Nelson did not like crept into Hero Giles\nHudson's face as he solemnly inclined his head.\n\n\"For the nonce, fair sir, thy companion is hale and sound. I beg your\npatience.\"\n\nWith a quick gesture the Atlantean raised his dolphin-shaped horn and\nblew three short blasts while Nelson, in sudden alarm, cocked his\nrifle and brought it in line with the other's chest. The glittering\nofficer saw the motion, but made no effort to move from the line of\nsights.\n\n\"Thy gesture avails naught,\" said he with stiff courtesy. \"When Hero\nGiles gives his word, it stands good though Heliopolis and the Empire\nof the Atlans fall.\"\n\nOne by one half a dozen spearmen appeared, all obviously very\nfrightened and only moved by an apparently Spartan discipline.\nPromptly they saluted, whereupon the Hero--as his title appeared to\nbe--uttered a number of brief commands in some guttural language\nentirely unintelligible to the dazed aviator.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPresently a strange column appeared, composed of some fifteen or\ntwenty disarmed men marching between a double rank of heavily equipped\nhoplites. As they drew near, they clasped imploring hands and\nevidently begged for mercy from the stern, tight jawed figure at\nNelson's side. Contemptuous and unhearing the prisoners' piteous\npleadings and lamentations, Hero Giles scowled upon them and\ndeliberately turned his back.\n\n\"What are they?\" inquired Nelson, vaguely alarmed. \"Enemies?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" There was a certain bitter savagery in the speaker's voice.\n\"These are the dauntless defenders of Atlans who ran at the report of\nthy weapon. Presently they die.\"\n\nIt was useless to interfere. The horrified aviator knew it and watched\nwith compassionate eyes while the condemned soldiers were ranged in a\nsingle, white faced line. They remained silent now, seeming to have\nfound courage now that hope was dead.\n\nUpon brief command from a subaltern, the guards wheeled about and\nretreated perhaps twenty yards down the passage. There they halted,\nglittering eyes peering through the slots in their helmets to fix\nthemselves upon the rigid prisoners who stood numbly resigned to\ndeath.\n\nWith surprising speed each member of that weird firing squad detached\na brazen grenade from his belt, then threw back his arm in exactly the\nsame attitude as a bomb-throwing doughboy. Then there came a short,\nsharp command and some fifteen or twenty grenades bobbed through the\nair to crash on the stones at the feet of the victims.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis head swimming with repulsion at the slaughter, Nelson beheld a\ncurious sight. It seemed that from the broken grenades appeared a\nyellowish green vapor which sprung _of its own accord_ upon the silent\nupright rank! In an instant it settled like falling snow upon the\ndoomed soldiers. For a breathless fraction of a second they stood,\neyes wide with horror, then collapsed, kicking and struggling as men\ndo under the influence of gas.\n\n\"Horrible!\" gasped Nelson. \"What was in the bombs?\"\n\n\"A vapor,\" explained Hero Giles shortly. \"A fungus vapor which,\nfalling upon exposed flesh, instantly invades the blood and multiplies\nby millions. See--\" He pointed to the nearest dead man and Nelson,\nwith starting eyes, watched a yellowish growth commencing to sprout\nfrom the dead man's nostrils. Swiftly the poisonous mould threw out\ntiny branches, spreading with astounding rapidity over the skin until,\nin less than a minute after the grenades had exploded, the whole\ntumbled heap of dead were covered with a horrible yellow green fungus\ngrowth.\n\n\"Thou seest?\" Hero Giles demanded. \"Powerful, is it not? It is against\nthe fungus vapor we wear this body armor made from the skin of a small\nlizard which inhabits our mountains.\"\n\nShocked and appalled, Nelson watched the retreat of the solemn, silent\nexecution party.\n\nOther soldiers fell to unconcernedly stripping their fallen comrades\nof equipment; then, to Nelson's horrified surprise, two hideous\nallosauri reappeared, shepherded by some six or eight keepers. Once\nthe horrible creatures were released, they pounced upon the dead and,\nsnarling horribly, commenced to rend and devour the corpses.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nToo shaken to comment or to make the protest he knew to be futile,\nNelson followed the stalwart English-speaking officer into a bronze\ndoor set in the cavern wall and up a short flight of stairs into what\nappeared to be a guard room, where food and wine were immediately set\nbefore the famished aviator.\n\n\"Yea,\" Hero Giles was saying as he set down a beautiful goblet and\nwiped the last traces of wine from his beard, \"we will soon o'ertake\nthy friend. He was but little hurt, and thou wilt assuredly join him\nin judgment before our great Emperor, Altorius XXII, at Heliopolis,\nour capital.\"\n\n\"Heliopolis?\" mumbled Nelson, his mouth full of delicious stew that\nseemed to be made of veal. \"Heliopolis? How far away is it?\"\n\n\"A hundred leagues more or less,\" the other smiled. \"Almost a third of\nthe distance up this great valley.\"\n\n\"One hundred leagues! Three hundred miles! Then we won't be there for\nseveral days.\"\n\nThe Hero's deep, rather ominous laughter rang out in the little rock\nhewn chamber. \"Days?\" he jeered. \"Days? Art thou mad? In two hours\nfrom the time we board the tube-road thou shalt learn thy fate from\nhis Serene Highness.\"\n\n\"What!\" Nelson's sunken and blood-shot gray eyes widened, while his\njaw dropped incredulously. \"One hundred leagues in two hours? As I\nremember there are about three miles to a league, so a hundred leagues\nin two hours means one hundred and fifty miles an hour! Why, that's\nutterly impossible! The Twentieth Century Limited doesn't go half so\nfast.\"\n\nSeveral enormous emeralds set into the other's bronze cuirasse\nglittered softly and the Hero's cold blue eyes hardened as his hand\nsought the grenade belt.\n\n\"Impossible? Dost doubt my words, sirrah?\" With an effort he\ncontrolled himself. \"Nay, thou shalt see for thyself ere long. The\ntube-road runs from Heracles to Heliopolis. Thou canst trace its\ncourse on this map here on the wall.\"\n\n\"The dog-born devils of Jarmuth have no such means of travel,\"\ncontinued the Atlantean, with a touch of smug pride that reminded\nNelson of a small town Middle Westerner speaking of the \"rightest,\ntightest little town west of the Mississippi.\"\n\nNelson found it extremely weird to be sitting there in a heavy arm\nchair, drinking good red wine with a fierce armor-clad warrior who\nwore sandals, sword and a war cloak such as might have graced the\nlimbs of Alexander of Macedon. But with the food and rich warm wine,\nhe felt blood, strength and self-confidence pouring back into his\nweary body. \"Jarmuth?\" he inquired. \"What is Jarmuth?\"\n\nAt his question the domineering, predatory face across the table\ndarkened and the scar on his cheek flamed red as a scowl of hatred\ngripped Hero Giles' visage.\n\n\"Jarmuth!\" snarled the Hero, and his great hand closed like a vise.\n\"Jarmuth! A nation of treacherous, gold-adoring cannibals, whose\ncountless hordes, spawned in the hot lowlands, ever threaten our\nfrontiers. I tell thee, Friend Nelson, the dog-sired Jereboam will not\nrest until mighty Heliopolis lies in a heap of smoking ashes.\"\n\n\"Evidently,\" thought Nelson, taken aback at the other's vehemence,\n\"this lad's English only in speech. I guess he's all Atlantean outside\nof that.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWarming to a fiercer pitch, the other fixed his guest with a\nsmoldering gaze. \"Jarmuth lies beyond Apidanus, the boiling river, and\nis the home of a savage horde whose horrid rites in Jezreel, the\ncapital, stink as an offense to Saturn and the High Gods! Why, mark\nyou,\" the warrior prince continued, interrupting his tirade to gulp a\ngoblet of wine, \"five years ago, by treachery, they seized the\nbeauteous Altara, sister of our gracious Emperor, and upon the annual\nfeast of Beelzebub, that vile demon they worship, the dark dogs would\nhave sacrificed and devoured her, according to their rites, had not\nour Emperor dispatched a ransom of six fair maidens to take her place.\n\n\"Every year since then Jereboam has exacted that same tribute. Every\nyear their princes and priests gorge themselves on the tender white\nflesh of our fairest and noblest maidens. But this tribute must end!\nThe augurs have told us so. Help will come from the Ice World.\" Hero\nGiles brought crashing down on the table a brawny fist, on whose\nwrist was fixed a bright, gem-studded bracelet.\n\nHorror-stricken, Nelson nodded.\n\n\"It is for this alone,\" continued the Hero somberly, \"that thy life\nand that of thy friend have been spared.\"\n\n\"So? I didn't notice,\" broke in Nelson, \"that you particularly went\nout of your way to preserve my health a while back.\"\n\nThe heavy golden head shook slowly and a grim smile played about those\nthin cruel lips. \"Nay, but I could have had thee slain. Come, as we go\nto the tube-road I'll show thee how much thou liest in the hollow of\nthis, my hand.\" He thrust out a broad, powerful palm. \"Forget not,\nfair sir. At any moment I or my Imperial Master may choose to close\nthat hand.\"\n\n\"Perhaps!\" stated Nelson, feeling it imperative to keep up his pose of\nindependence. \"But it might just happen that your hand would close on\na porcupine, and so far from hurting the porcupine it would be your\nhand that would be hurt.\"\n\n\"Sirrah!\" The Atlantean sprang to his feet and one hand shot to the\ngrip of his ponderous, bronze sword; but even more quickly Nelson\nsnatched up his rifle, a thin smile playing on his lips.\n\n\"Drop it,\" he snapped. \"Control yourself, or I'll plug you like that\nallosaur. Be reasonable, can't you? We both want something, and\nperhaps can help each other gain it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe taut, menacing figure in armor relaxed and, with a gentle clank of\naccoutrement, Hero Giles resumed his seat.\n\n\"Prithee pardon me,\" he apologized ungraciously. \"I was ever a\nhot-head and there is much in what thou sayest. We wish to force an\nend to this annual tribute--if not to regain our beloved Altara. And\nthou\"--his heavy, golden eyebrows shot up--\"and thou, what dost thou\nwish?\"\n\nNelson lowered the menacing barrel. \"I want the return of Richard\nAlden, free passage back to that spot where he was captured and plenty\nof food and help should we need it. If I aid you in one, you must\npromise me in the other.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" returned the other doubtfully. \"But I myself can pledge naught\nsave thy immediate safety. 'Tis for our Imperial Majesty to say\nwhether both thou and thy friend shall live, or whether ye shall feed\nour war dogs. Come now, we must go to Heliopolis.\"\n\n[Illustration: _Map of Jarmuth and Atlans_]\n\nPicking up his heavy, bronze helmet the Atlantean prince set it on his\nyellow head and waited impatiently for Nelson to drain the last of his\nwine. Then, with a swirl of his green cloak, he vanished through the\nrock wall, closely followed by a singularly distracted and alarmed\naviator.\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nA bright yellow glare steadily increased to mark the end of the tunnel\ndown which the two had progressed; then, with the sharp abruptness of\na hand-clap, there resounded a loud challenge in that unintelligible\nAtlantean language, above which the hiss of steam could be loudly\nheard.\n\nInstantly the Atlantean prince strode forward, a commanding figure.\nMomentarily his helmet and the dangling grenadelike bombs were sharply\noutlined against that unearthly yellow light. He raised his hand and\ndropped it, palm outward, to his chin in what must have been a salute.\nThe hissing sound of steam then faded into silence.\n\nFollowed at a respectful distance by a pair of silent, bronze-helmeted\nhoplites, Nelson and his guide descended a narrow stair, which\nbroadened at the base. It was a very long staircase composed of\nperhaps two or three hundred steps which were occasionally interrupted\nby wide stone terraces. On these level spaces were fixed what appeared\nto be enormous field guns of glittering brass. They were similar, yet\nsomehow oddly dissimilar, to the great guns Nelson had seen in\nFrance.\n\n\"Behold, oh Wanderer,\" Hero Giles declaimed impressively, \"the lands\nof Atlans and Jarmuth!\"\n\nIt was a weird landscape that met Nelson's half-unbelieving gaze, a\nlandscape green with that brilliance peculiar to spring meadows, lying\nbeneath the same deep blue sky that overarched the surrounding barren\nice fields which hemmed in this astounding valley.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA slight smile played over Hero Giles' thin lips as he watched the\namazed aviator.\n\n\"The splendor of our country must indeed astound thee,\" he observed,\n\"having come from the dreary fastness of the outer Ice World. But\ncome; we are now to pass the great retortii guarding the entrance into\nthe valley.\"\n\nNelson's eyes turned again to the weapons that so oddly resembled\nfield guns. He examined them closely, inspecting them narrowly for the\ndifferences he knew must exist between them and the artillery that had\nthundered during the War of the Nations.\n\nThe chief difference lay in the mounting of these starkly beautiful\nweapons. They seemed to be fixed on a movable pivot set into the coal\nblack rock itself. Like modern artillery, these curious pieces of\nordnance bore a bronze shield to protect their crews, through which\nprojected the long and very narrow barrels of the guns. Grouped like\ncannoneers about their piece stood various red-crested Atlantean\nartillerymen. At a glance Nelson recognized the difference in their\nequipment from that of the spearmen behind them. These former bore no\nshields, no swords or bombs, but wore that same kind of leather\nbody-armor which graced the powerful limbs of Hero Giles. Their\nhelmets, too, were different: only the dolphin crest with a tuft of\nred feathers spouting from it bore any resemblance to those of the\ninfantry, and, moreover, the artillerymen's eyes were shielded by\ngoggles with thick blue lenses.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs the Hero approached, officers among them saluted, then sank on one\nknee with head humbly bent.\n\n\"Rather odd looking guns,\" commented Nelson. \"I'm not much of an\nartilleryman, but I'm wondering how you take up the recoil?\"\n\nThe Atlantean's laugh, which always reminded his guest of the purr of\na tiger, rang out. \"Why, marry, good sir, there is no recoil! These\nguns do not use that powder which Sir Henry, founder of our line, did\nspeak of. Thou wouldst see one fired?\"\n\nHis curiosity immeasurably piqued, Nelson nodded, whereupon the\nAtlantean wheeled about and barked a brief command. With truly\nPrussian precision, the artillerymen sprang to their posts, some to a\nseries of levers which sprouted from the rock platform without any\napparent connection, and some to wheels and gauges of varying size\nthat clustered in bewildering intricacy about the breech of the great\nbrass gun.\n\n\"Markest thou that tree yonder, on the ledge of the valley?\" The\nAtlantean's blunt outstretched finger indicated a towering pine\nsprouting from among a mass of reddish volcanic rock at the rim of\nthat new world.\n\n\"Yes, I see it, but--\" Nelson was astounded. A pine tree in the upper\nArctic! That alone was sufficient cause for amazement. From a stiff\nred-plumed gun captain issued a brief series of commands which set the\nwonderfully drilled crew to silently adjusting their training and\nelevating mechanism. Click! Clack! Sis-s-s-s!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll up and down the vast staircase other gun crews stood watching.\nNelson saw their weird, bluish goggles raised to that platform where,\nfor all the world like a coast defense howitzer, the great cannon\nswung majestically about on the ponderous, brazen column which seemed\nto support it. Gradually the muzzle was elevated, then traversed a few\nfeet, to finally come to a halt.\n\n\"Jakul, a Hero!\" shouted the gun captain, his hand raised to Hero\nGiles.\n\n\"Thou art ready, Friend Nelson?\" he inquired in tolerant amusement.\n\"Mark well yon pine tree!\n\n\"Storr!\"\n\nNelson saw one of the armored cannoneers bend forward, firmly grasp a\nshort lever with both hands. In anticipation of a terrific report, the\naviator pressed finger tips to his ears. There followed not a\nthundering crash, but a curious, eery, high-pitched scream, rather\nlike that of a fire siren. There was no smoke! Nelson's incredulous\neyes sought the muzzle of the gun and detected issuing from it what\nappeared to be a thin, white rod. This shimmering stream of silver\nshot straight towards the pine tree, gradually widening and giving off\nfeathery billows of steam. In a fraction of a moment the target was\ncompletely veiled from sight in a furious pall of clouds which, to\nNelson's great astonishment, did not dissipate nor condense with the\nspeed of ordinary steam.\n\n\"Nava!\"\n\nWith impressive suddenness the screaming sound faded, leaving a sort\nof stunned silence on the gun platform. The gunners stalked back to\ntheir original stations.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSlowly, reluctantly, the mist enveloping the pine tree cleared away\nand Nelson felt a chill creeping up his spine. The pine was a good\nthree hundred yards away, yet now it sagged limp to earth, stripped of\nbark, twigs and needles, only the bright yellow trunk and major\nbranches remaining.\n\n\"That tree was a good two feet thick,\" mused the astounded aviator,\n\"yet the steam gun bent it like a sapling. My God! What would it do to\na man?\"\n\n\"What thinkest thou of our retortii?\" The Atlantean's beard glinted\nlike metal as he shook with a grim, silent laughter. \"These great\nretortii can shoot half a league and will blast any living thing in\ntheir path. I tell thee, friend Nelson, the discharge of even a small\nretortii will strip the flesh from a man's bones as a peasant strips\nthe husk from an ear of corn!\"\n\n\"Fearful, terrible!\" was Nelson's awed comment. \"Is there no defence\nagainst them?\"\n\n\"Of course.\" The Hero's green feather-crested helmet gleamed with a\nnod. \"Was there ever an instrument of war that had not its defence?\nYea, we have the blue vapor to shatter steam particles--it is called\nthe blue maxima. Thou wilt presently see some of our troops armed with\nit.\"\n\n\"But where does this steam come from? How is it generated?\" These two\nwere the first of a host of questions which trembled on Nelson's lips.\n\n\"The steam,\" replied the Atlantean, \"comes from the earth. We compress\nit many times, then feed it into our retortii. Without the heat of\nMother Earth and our flame suns we would all perish. Steam is our\nmotive power, our defence and our enemy!\"\n\nHe flung his hand towards the vast valley stretched before them. It\nwas hemmed in on either side by colossal breath-taking mountain\nranges, whose caps shone and glittered with an eternal snow.\n\n\"Some foothills! They must rise all of 25,000 feet from the valley\nfloor,\" decided the aviator, \"and I should imagine this valley is a\ngood mile below sea level. Yes! That must be it: this nightmare\ncountry lies in a huge geographical fault--something like the Dead\nSea.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMile after mile he could see fertile green land stretching away toward\nsome low undulating hills on the horizon. Atlans was very thickly\nsettled--that he recognized at once--for the terrain was divided and\nsub-divided into a vast checker-board, such as he had seen in France\nand Germany, while terraces, green with produce, had been laboriously\ngouged out of the frowning mountain sides.\n\nThen his eye encountered the source of that curious amber light which\npervaded the whole valley. A titanic flaming gas vent spouted like a\ncyclopean torch from the peak of a nearby mountain. Its steady,\nsubdued roar struck Nelson's ear as he turned away his eyes, for the\nglare was too intense to be long endured. Further down the valley were\ntwo more such incandescent vents, shooting their flaming tongues\nboldly into the sky, warming the air and casting that rich, amber\nradiance over all.\n\n\"That is Mount Ossa nearest us,\" the Atlantean's voice came as though\nfrom a long distance. Victor Nelson was too staggered, too unspeakably\namazed to register the fact of the Hero's proximity. \"Below are Pelion\nand Jilboa, which, with Jabor, the greatest of all the flames,\nilluminate and warm the valley.\"\n\nNelson's eye, trained to be all observant, ranged far and wide, noting\nthe presence of many lacy, frothing geysers which spouted at varying\nintervals. There were, also, many steaming ponds and waterfalls which\nsprang in smoky confusion from the rock palisades to either side.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNearer at hand he could distinguish a number of huge stone structures,\nevidently forts and public buildings. Strategically placed all about\nwere more of those terrible brass retortii, gleaming dully under the\nincandescent glare of the flame sun.\n\n\"Come,\" cried Hero Giles with an impatient gesture of his hand, \"we\nmust e'en hasten to the tube-road terminal. Word has long since been\nsent to Heliopolis of thy arrival.\"\n\nDownwards into the valley, which grew ever warmer and more fertile,\nthe Atlantean led on, explaining a thousand and one details to the\nastounded aviator. Presently they approached the nearest of the great\nstone structures and Nelson received yet another shock. In a courtyard\nwas drilling what would correspond to a troop of cavalry in the outer\nworld. In orderly ranks the troopers wheeled, marched and\ncounter-marched, their brazen armor twinkling and clashing softly as\nthey carried out their evolutions with an amazing precision. But what\nastonished Nelson was the fact that each of these strange troopers\nbestrode a lithe, long-limbed variety of dinosaur, a good half smaller\nthan the allosauri he had encountered in the tunnel. These agile\ncreatures ran about on their hind legs with astonishing speed, using a\nlong reptilian tail as a balance.\n\nOn the back of each trooper was fastened a compact circular copper\ntank, from which sprouted a flexible metal hose that ended in what\nlooked like a ponderous type of pistol.\n\nIn distinction to the red of the artillerymen and the blue of the\nHoplites, these curious cavalrymen wore brilliant crests of yellow\nfeathers, and from their lance tips fluttered tiny pennons of that\nsame color.\n\n\"They must travel at least as fast as a race horse,\" decided the\naviator after studying the swift evolutions of the scaly chargers. To\nhis ears came the curious dry scrape and rattle of their horny claws\non the stone pavement of the drill yard.\n\nHe would have lingered to see more, for those grotesque, lizard-like\nchargers interested him immensely, but Hero Giles beckoned\nimperiously. So, dropping the Winchester to the hollow of his arm,\nNelson followed him into the brilliantly gas-lit depths of the great\nstructure.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEverywhere were red bearded, white skinned soldiers, staring at him\nwith the frank curiosity of children. Powerful, magnificently built\nfellows they were, all in uniforms of different designs.\n\nThe walls about him, Nelson noticed, were covered with really\nbeautiful friezes depicting various warlike scenes in that pure beauty\nof proportion found only in ancient Grecian temples.\n\nOn and on through resounding tunnels, past busy markets and barracks,\nhurried the two travelers. Then the Atlantean halted before a\ngracefully arched doorway where stood two hoplites, who immediately\nlowered spears to bar the passage. At a word from Hero Giles, however,\nthey saluted and fell back in position--immovable, grim guardians.\n\nInside was a short staircase, beautifully wrought of bronze. Up this\nflashed the Atlantean's mail-clad body; then he came to a halt under\nthe direct rays of a blinding light.\n\nNelson, on arriving above, discovered that the chamber was lined with\njointless brass about ten feet high and circular in shape. \"What's\nthis?\" he demanded curiously.\n\n\"The terminal of the tube-road. In a moment thou shalt see the great\ncylinder arrive.\"\n\nThe words were hardly by the Hero's lips when there appeared,\nnoiselessly and amid a great rush of air, a huge metal cylinder that\nran upon a sort of truck. It rumbled up to the edge of the platform\nand from its end a small door was opened.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHero Giles exchanged a few sentences with an elderly man who appeared\nto act as control master, then he indicated the glowing doorway of the\ncylinder.\n\nFirmly clutching his Winchester, Nelson bowed his head and stepped\ninside, there to discover a luxury he had never anticipated. The\ninterior of the cylinder was brilliantly lit and on both sides were\nranged wide divans, strewn with many silken cushions. In a rack nearby\nwere several graceful glass amphora, filled with red and tawny wine.\n\n\"The cylinder must be about thirty feet long,\" the marvelling American\ntold himself, \"and about ten feet in diameter. Guess it works on the\nsame principle as the compressed air tubes the department stores use\nto send change with.\"\n\nGingerly he tested the nearest divan and marvelled at the curious\nsoftness of what appeared to be a gigantic tiger skin. Meanwhile Hero\nGiles entered, his stern features even more serious, but with him was\na younger man who resembled him not a little.\n\n\"Fair brother,\" said the Atlantean to his companion, \"this is he of\nwhom I spoke. Friend Nelson, this is Hero John, my next youngest\nbrother--he, too, speaks the language of the great Sir Henry Hudson.\"\n\nThe metallic clang of the door being shut brought a sharp qualm to\nNelson's heart. \"What are they doing?\" he demanded quickly.\n\n\"The menials bolt the door beyond,\" explained Hero Giles with amused\ngravity. \"In a moment our cylinder will be placed in the dispatching\nchamber, where steam pressure will be exerted. We shall then be hurled\nthrough this vacuum tube-road to Heliopolis, greatest city of Atlans.\nIn an hour we will be there.\"\n\nOutside sounded the sudden insistent clangor of a gong, and\nimmediately the hiss of steam grew louder. The car shuddered as the\nhissing rose to an eery scream, then all at once the cylinder leaped\nforward, nearly hurling Nelson from his seat. He struggled as best he\nmight to gain his equilibrium, for the eyes of the others were on him.\n\nThen, more smoothly, the great cylinder gathered speed and hurtled on\nthrough the darkness of the tube-road towards Heliopolis, where Victor\nNelson would read the book of Fate.\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nOn the arrival platform at Heliopolis reigned a fierce excitement.\nNelson noted countless armed and unarmed warriors hurrying to and fro,\ndesperately intent on reaching their various posts, and snarling\nill-temperedly as they elbowed their fellows aside. As soon as they\nappeared, Hero Giles and his brother became the center of an excited\npress of gorgeously armored officers.\n\n\"Hum!\" murmured the aviator under his breath. \"Something's happened.\nMust be a revolution, an earthquake or a Democratic convention in\ntown; these boys seem all steamed up.\"\n\nIntently he studied the ring of fierce, red bearded faces surrounding\nhis late hosts and gathered that indeed some event of overwhelming\nimportance had taken place. Presently a splendid falcon-eyed old man\nin a yellow cloak strode up, struggling to control himself. His\nresemblance to the two Heroes struck Nelson immediately.\n\n\"Harken ye,\" he cried, in that Elizabethan English which appeared to\nbe the hieratic language of the New Atlantis' rulers. \"Have ye heard?\nThe dog-conceived sons of Semites have broken the truce! But three\nmeasures gone by, a brigade of their mounted podokesons swooped down\non this very suburb of Tricca, yea, to the very gates of Heliopolis!\nThe foul man-eating dogs slaughtered royal serfs and burnt two\nquarters of the suburb to the ground! Moreover, they seized that\nprisoner\"--Nelson's heart gave a great leap at the word--\"whom thou\nsentest from the mountain passes.\"\n\n\"What!\" In two swift strides Nelson was before the gray beard, his\nblood-shot eyes blazing with a strange light. \"What did you say about\nthat prisoner?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe old man, who had obviously not noticed Nelson's presence, was\nthunderstruck to hear him speak in English until Hero Giles briefly\nexplained his presence.\n\n\"Yea!\" continued the elder, flinging lamentations furiously over his\nshoulder, \"these swine of the Lost Tribes captured him and slew his\nescort. They have retreated towards the Apidanus, slaying, burning and\npillaging as they go.\"\n\nA sickening, deadly fear gripped the weary aviator. This was too much!\nBad as it was to have Richard Alden captured by these weird\ndescendants of a long vanished race, it was far worse to have him\nfall into the hands of their deadly enemies, the Jarmuthians, decadent\nsurvivors of Israel's Five Lost Tribes. The possibility of a rescue\nnow seemed hopelessly and crushingly vague and distant. What could he\ndo now?\n\nIn dread despair he glanced about, amazed at the prodigious numbers of\nscowling men who hurried by, obviously intent upon the commencement of\na campaign for revenge.\n\nThen Hero Giles turned his scarred, warlike face, now set in granite\nlines. \"Come, Friend Nelson, my uncle Anthony bids me take thee direct\nto the presence of His Serene Splendor, where he lies encamped at\nCierum, by the shores of Lake Copias. There he marshals the army of\nAtlans for a march through the hot country on Jezreel. I tell thee,\nthou hast come in stirring times. From Heraclea, Thebes, Ys and Mayda\nwill come the Phalanxes. Once and forever we will deal the dogs of\nJarmuth a final blow.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nVictor Nelson never forgot the hours that followed. Issuing at a fast\ntrot from the tube-road terminal, the two Heroes led the way to a vast\nstructure, in which were stabled both the terrific allosauri and the\npodokesauri, those swift dinosaurs which seemed to serve the\nAtlanteans as horses. The dreadful hiss and snarl of these monsters\nresounded in his ears long before the stables came in sight, and that\ncurious musky odor he had noted in the tunnel was sickeningly strong.\n\nEverywhere he read signs of hurried preparations for war. Savage,\nsurly allosauri were led from their stables, one by one, long necks\nwrithing snakelike backwards and forwards. Then their keepers would,\nafter a moment's tussle, secure huge leather muzzles over their gaping\njaws, and the huge reptiles would be led waddling along on their hind\nlegs out into a vast courtyard, there to hiss and strike at their\nnearest fellows.\n\n\"Thinkest thou couldst ride a podoko?\" inquired Hero John, an anxious\nlook on his handsome, friendly features. \"They are difficult to\nmanage--but swift in flight as the birds themselves!\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied the aviator, \"but I'm damn well going to try.\nIf your Emperor can help me rescue Alden, the sooner we get started,\nthe better.\"\n\nFor all his brave resolutions, his heart sank, as the green kilted\nkeeper led forth three podokesauri. Nelson stared curiously at them\nas, hopping along, they drew near, to bare needle-sharp teeth at him\nwhile, brazen stirrups on either side jangled softly against their\nrough, scaly hides.\n\nIn evident high spirits the beasts snuffed the air and pawed with\ntheir tiny front legs excitedly, making their sharp talons glisten\nlike polished steel. A bridle dangled from the mouth of each and a\nring set in the thick upper lip served as a further means of control.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt a sharp \"_Oya_!\" from an old and toothless keeper, the first podoko\nsank flat to the stone floor like a kneeling camel.\n\n\"A sturdy beast,\" commented Hero Giles, tightening his belt and\nsecuring the clasps to the emerald-green war cloak. \"Here, Friend\nNelson, thou hadst best don a helmet; the podokos on occasion throw\nback their heads and so might wound thee.\" So saying, he set foot in\nstirrup and swung up into a saddle which was built up high in the\ncantle to correct the sharp downward slope of the reptile's muscular\nback.\n\nAt a signal, Hero Giles' ugly mount rose to its height and shuffled\nawkwardly sidewise, as the old keeper, his eyes very wide and curious,\nled forward Nelson's charger.\n\n\"Look,\" said Hero John with a reassuring smile. \"The chin strap\nbuckles so--be sure it fits snug, else it will pound on thy head to\nthe podoko's stride. If thou wouldst turn to the left, pull the rein\nso, to the right so, and if thou wouldst stop, pull strongly on the\nnose ring; 'tis not so difficult.\" He laid a friendly hand on Nelson's\nflannel clad shoulder. \"How wilt thou manage thy curious weapon?\" he\ninquired doubtfully. \"Perhaps thou hadst best leave it behind.\"\n\nThere was a grim smile on Nelson's weary and wind burned features.\n\"Not on your life, old son! This Winchester and I stick closer\ntogether than the Siamese twins.\"\n\nNelson thrust his foot into a heavy stirrup, eased his weight into the\nhigh peaked saddle and gripped the pommel, for though an excellent\nhorseman, he had no clue as to what motion would ensue. It was wise he\ndid so, for the podoko reared suddenly, almost flinging his rider from\nthe saddle.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nImmediately Hero John mounted, raised his right hand and dealt his\npodoko a stinging slap on the fore-shoulder. The great reptile hissed\nin protest, but commenced to walk off with an awkward, hopping step.\nNelson's mount followed suit.\n\nFaster and faster ran the podokos, their long and scale-covered necks\nstretched far out ahead while their tails lifted correspondingly, much\nlike that of an airplane about to take off.\n\n\"Whew! He must be doing all of forty-five,\" gasped Nelson, while the\nwind whistled about his ears and snapped madly at the yellow crest of\nhis brazen helmet.\n\nThe ride which ensued remained forever fixed in the aviator's memory.\nLike so many shots from a gun the three podokos darted off out of the\nstables, past a gate guarded by a battery of retortii, whose red\nplumed cannoneers sprang to attention as the three strangely assorted\nriders sped out into the amber, perpetual light of Atlans.\n\nNelson, on finding his balance, looked about him to receive\nimpressions of immensely tall structures, of pyramids which, like the\nziggurats of Sumaria, and Babylon, were surmounted with beautifully\nproportioned temples.\n\n\"Must be at least a million people in this burg of Heliopolis,\"\nthought Nelson, easing his Winchester.\n\nHour after hour they sped along, frequently overtaking detachments of\ntroops. Twice they halted to change mounts, though the podokos seemed\nquite tireless.\n\nAt the end of five hours' furious riding, Nelson beheld a dense white\ncloud low on the horizon.\n\n\"What's that?\" he demanded. \"Fog?\"\n\n\"No,\" Hero John informed him. \"Yonder flows the Apidanus, the boiling\nriver. Not far away to the left lies the frontier fortress of Cierum,\nwhere is encamped the Emperor, who will sit in judgment upon thee.\"\n\nNelson's heart sank. He had been so occupied with his fears for Alden\nthat he had not dwelt upon his own precarious position.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nScarcely half an hour elapsed, if Nelson's wrist watch were running\ncorrectly, before he reached the tremendous, swarming camp of Altorius\nXXII, Emperor of Atlans. Hero Giles proved to be a powerful talisman,\nfor everywhere officers and men alike saluted respectfully and sank on\none knee as he passed.\n\n\"Wait here,\" he snapped, as the podokos sank obediently to the dust.\n\"Brother John, do thou guard Friend Nelson while I seek permission of\nHis Serene Splendor to bring the Wanderer into the Presence.\"\n\nAlmost immediately the elder Atlantean returned, a frown on his\nscarred, rather brutal visage. \"Come,\" he muttered, \"but I fear for\nthee, Friend Nelson; His Splendor is in a savage mood--this raid hath\nstirred his ire beyond all bounds.\"\n\n\"Nothing like cheering up a patient before he goes into the operating\nroom,\" thought Nelson, and quietly threw off the safety on his\nWinchester. \"Six shots,\" he reflected. \"Well, if I go, I reckon I'll\ntake some damn good company along.\"\n\nThe aviator was led down a long passage, at every ten feet of which\nwas posted an enormous scowling guard, whose spears, retortii and\narmor were painted a brilliant jade-green. Then a musical, deep-toned\ngong boomed twice, and Hero Giles halted before an exquisitely wrought\ndoor, which, without any apparent propulsion, silently slid back into\nthe massive stone walls, revealing a huge, brilliantly lit circular\nchamber that was hung with emerald-green hangings. In the center,\nsurrounded by a royal guard of nobles in splendidly jeweled armor, was\nreared a dais, upon which stood a throne that blazed with the most\nvaried collection of diamonds that Nelson could ever have imagined.\n\n\"Down on your face,\" rasped Hero Giles as, in common with his brother,\nhe knelt and then fell prostrate on the cool black marble floor.\n\n\"Damned if I will,\" murmured Nelson, and remained erect.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBolt upright, he looked across the interval and found himself staring\ninto the furious eyes of one of the handsomest men he had ever beheld.\nGripping his Winchester in a kind of \"port arms\" position, he stood to\nattention--by some curious kink of the brain reverting to his military\ndays. And so the two men, different as day and night, faced each\nother. Altorius XXII clad in robes of scarlet, and a glittering\ncuirasse that glowed like the evening sun. His yellow head was truly\nsplendid, reminiscent of that of a young Roman Emperor. The hair, like\nthat of the Hudsonian Heroes, was blond, curly and close cropped. Yes,\nthought the awed but self-contained American, there was something\ngenuinely imperial about the Emperor's aquiline visage, for a high\nintelligent forehead and piercing blue eyes dominated a strong mouth,\nwhich was marred by a decidedly cruel twist at the corners. On him,\nalso, was set the stamp of Sir Henry Hudson's dauntless race.\n\n\"Put him is a business suit and a soft gray hat,\" mused Nelson, \"and\nyou would find a dozen like him in any of London's best clubs.\"\n\n\"Down on thy face, sirrah!\" Outraged, the Emperor's voice rang like\nthe peal of a brazen trumpet through the great pillared audience\nchamber. The nearest guardsmen held themselves ready, hand on sword\nhilt.\n\n\"No.\" Nelson's shaggy black head went back as he found his tongue at\nlast. \"No, Your Majesty. In America we have our own way of showing\nrespect for authority. I'm an American and, with all respect, I'll\nsalute you as one.\"\n\nSo saying, his hand flicked up in a sharp military salute to the visor\nof that Atlantean helmet which he still wore.\n\n\"All damn foolishness,\" he silently told himself. \"I feel like the\nlead in a ten, twenty, thirty melodrama. But I suppose it's got to be\ndone.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Emperor's teeth gleamed in a half snarl as he sprang with Jovian\nwrath to his feet.\n\n\"Dog! How darest thou bandy words with us?\"\n\n\"Have mercy!\" hoarsely pleaded Hero John as he lay on the floor. \"Have\nmercy, oh Splendor! He is but an ignorant wanderer from the Ice\nWorld.\"\n\nIt appeared that the young Hero was something of a favorite, for the\nmasterful, thunder-browed Emperor checked himself and, still\nglowering, settled back on the diamond throne.\n\n\"Ye have my permission to enter and approach.\"\n\nWhereupon, Hero Giles arose and, with many black looks at his guest,\nstrode forward to briefly explain his presence.\n\nNelson felt Altorius' blazing blue eyes search his face.\n\n\"Then he whom the dog-born Jereboam captured was thy friend?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Nelson with dignity, \"my best friend. Alden and I have\ntraveled and wandered all over the world together.\"\n\n\"Over the world? The Ice World?\" Altorius seemed interested, for he\nleaned forward, muscle corded arms very brown against the frosty\nbrilliance of the stones studding his throne. He flipped back a\nscarlet cloak and bent a searching look on the straight, unafraid\nfigure below.\n\nImpatient to reach a decision, Nelson forebore to amplify the\nEmperor's assumption that the outside world was all ice and snow.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"from the land of America. I've spoken with Hero\nGiles, Your Majesty's Captain-General.\"\n\n\"So, then, no doubt, he has told you of the law of our country?\"\nAltorius' white teeth shown again in the depths of his short, curling\nbeard.\n\n\"Perhaps.\" Nelson was vague, wishing no further amplification.\n\n\"The law of Atlans,\" pronounced the Emperor with a frown, \"states that\na stranger must prove his worth to the State, else he must be put to\ndeath. Thank thou thy gods that thou hast not fallen into the hands of\nthe Lost Tribes, for assuredly thou would perish miserably, as must\nthy comrade.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What is the law of Jarmuth?\" inquired Nelson, his mind furiously at\nwork.\n\n\"Their law states that the stranger within their gates must perish on\nthe altar of Beelzebub, Jarmuth's blood-hungry demon god.\" A momentary\nexpression of sadness crept into the Emperor's blue eyes and he beat a\nsquare, powerful hand on the arm of his throne. \"Aye, blood-hungry!\nLack-a-day! But yesterday, six of our fairest maidens crossed the\nboiling river, never to return.\"\n\nNelson was about to speak when from outside came the blast of a\ntrumpet. The assembled Atlanteans started, paused, and remained\nsilent, listening intently.\n\nHero Giles looked up, a light kindling in his deep-set eyes. \"Yon was\nan Israelite trumpet.\"\n\nAs the words left his lips there came a hurried rapping at the portal,\nwhereupon the guards sprang forward.\n\n\"Bid them enter.\" Altorius seemed strangely tense and uneasy.\n\nQuietly the door rolled back as before, revealing an Atlantean whose\neyes rolled with alarm. He hurried forward and flung himself on the\nfloor at the Emperor's sandaled feet.\n\n\"Harken, oh Serene Splendor! Waiting without is an embassy from his\nMajesty of Jarmuth. They bear words for thine Imperial Highness.\"\n\n\"Now, by Saturn! Here's insolence--at an hour such as this!\" With a\nfurious swirl of his scarlet cloak Altorius leaped to his feet, hand\non the ivory handle of his sword, which, to Nelson's amusement was not\nof bronze, but of good, blue-gray steel.\n\n\"I'll bet it's old Sir Henry's original pet sticker,\" he thought.\n\n\"Bring on these dogs of Israel,\" growled Altorius. \"They shall die!\"\n\n\"Gently, gently, oh Splendor,\" murmured Hero John. \"Our full force is\nnot yet camped on the Plains of Poseidon.\"\n\n\"Nay! Have the rogues flayed alive!\" was the advice of the hot-headed\nelder brother. He, like the Emperor, was scowling and livid with fury.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPresently there appeared four men, stalwart warriors as totally\ndifferent in aspect from the Atlanteans as humans might be. The two\nraces were alike only in splendid physical proportions and human\nfigures. They, the Jarmuthians, were black haired and dark skinned,\nwhereas the Atlanteans, with the exception of Sir Henry's progeny,\nwere red headed. Truculently the half naked ambassadors strode over\nthe polished floor, which reflected their rude images. Their hairy\nchests, arms and legs afforded a sharp contrast to the neat Atlantean\nnobles, who drew back with expressions of disgust.\n\n\"Good God!\" gasped Nelson in lively surprise. \"A bunch of the boys\nfrom Seventh Avenue!\"\n\nIt was true: each Jarmuthian clearly betrayed his Hebraic origin in\nhuge, fleshy nose and pendulous lower lip, so characteristic of the\nSemitic race. They were fierce, shaggy fellows, naked from the waist\nup save for a kind of jointed body armor, reminiscent of a Roman\nlegionnaire's. Their long abundant blue-black hair was either plaited\nor flowed uncut over splendidly muscled shoulders. Their beards on the\nother hand were short and frizzed into tight curls, in the Assyrian\nmanner. On each man's head was set a highly polished, pointed casque\nof copper, surmounted in each instance by the six-pointed star of\nSolomon. Otherwise the brutal looking emissaries wore nothing but\ndirty, food-spotted kilts and rough hide sandals secured by thongs.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith all the insolence and self assurance of conquerors in the\npresence of slaves the four jet-eyed ambassadors swaggered up to the\ndiamond throne. Then the foremost briefly inclined his head towards\nAltorius in a grudging salute and began to speak in deep, resonant\ntones.\n\nFrom that point Nelson could understand nothing of the conversation as\nit was carried on in the guttural and unintelligible language of that\nlost realm, but, from time to time Hero John found opportunity to\ntranslate an occasional phrase.\n\nDarker and darker grew the brows of the gorgeously attired Emperor and\nhis eagle-visaged Captain-General as they listened to the pompous\noratory of the foremost Jarmuthian, and in dark fury more than one\nAtlantean noble half drew his sword when the speaker fell silent at\nlast.\n\n\"He said,\" the younger Atlantean whispered, \"that Jereboam is no\nlonger satisfied with six maidens. Beelzebub demands a further\noffering of six more damsels to be delivered before the third division\nof time on the morrow. By Saturn! The insolence of these besotted\nswine passes all tolerance!\"\n\nFrom the Atlantean Emperor's outraged negative gestures, Nelson\nsurmised that Altorius was making an emphatic refusal and even adding\nsome vicious threat. The foremost Jarmuthian slapped huge dirty hands\non armored hips and fell to laughing with an insolence that would have\nprovoked a rabbit.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nForgetting dignity and self-control, Altorius, in a single tigerish\nleap sprang from his throne and knocked the mocker senseless with a\npowerful blow to the jaw. Then, spurning the fallen Jarmuthian with a\nsandaled foot, the Atlantean fixed blazing eyes upon the three other\nambassadors who, nothing daunted, closed up, muttering savagely in\ntheir frizzed black beards, while their hands sought the spot where\nswords would normally have hung.\n\n\"Nice right to the jaw,\" commented Nelson with a grin. \"He's still\nEnglish enough to use his fists.\" He turned to Hero John, who stood\nwith an expression of horror on his comely features. \"What caused the\nrow?\"\n\n\"Verily, our plight is grave indeed. That braggart dog threatened to\nmarch on Heliopolis in the first division of morning, and,\"--Hero\nJohn's lips compressed into a hopeless, taut expression--\"our\nreinforcing phalanxes can never arrive in time to defend Cierum at\nthat hour. Should the defense fail, as it must--since they outnumber\nus three to one for the nonce--it would cost us many thousands of men\nto stay the blood-hungry hordes of Jereboam once freed on the great\nplain.\"\n\nLike a star shell bursting on a cloudy night came the inception of an\nidea.\n\n\"Here,\" cried Nelson, \"I've an idea! Maybe I can fix a stall until the\nrest of your boys do a General Phil Sheridan and get here.\"\n\nHero John's blue eyes widened uncomprehendingly. \"What?\" he demanded.\n\"What dost thou propose?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNelson's hand crept to his head, for the unaccustomed weight and heat\nof the helmet made it itch. \"You say these bright boys from over the\nborder want to chow six more girls? Am I right?\"\n\n\"Yea, oh Friend Nelson, they demand the victims to-morrow morn, else\nthey advance.\"\n\n\"All right.\" Nelson was thinking fast now, a dreadful vision of\nRichard Alden stretched for sacrifice on the brass altar of Beelzebub\never floating before his aching eyes. \"Tell those Semites that they\ncan have those six girls _if_ they can take them away from me.\"\n\nA puzzled frown creased the younger Hero's brow and he tugged\nthoughtfully at his scant yellow beard. \"Prithee pardon me, but I do\nnot comprehend.\"\n\n\"All right, get this now! Tell the Jarmuthians that they can send six\nof their biggest and best scrappers, one for each girl. If they can\ntake any one of those girls away from me, they take them all--taking\nme as well--and we'll all get the works in Jezreel together. But, on\nthe other hand, if I kill their six champions, then Alden is returned\nunharmed, the six girls come home and the six other girls come back\ntoo--and there'll be no more hostages. I don't think they'll agree to\nor even consider surrendering Your Princess, Altara. I'm sorry I can't\naccomplish that, too. But if I can stop this annual tribute, it won't\nbe so bad, will it?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRounder and rounder grew the Atlantean's eyes, and he gaped like a\nschool boy in a side show.\n\n\"What sayest thou? Thou alone to overcome six of their best warriors?\nNay, but this is folly! Moonshine! What knowest thou of their\nweapons?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" admitted Nelson, \"but I do know Brother Winchester here.\"\nHe patted the smooth stock. \"He's mighty persuasive, properly\nhandled.\"\n\n\"But they are armored! They have the fungus bombs, the light retortii\nand the javelin!\"\n\n\"Righto!\" agreed Nelson a trifle carelessly, \"but you don't know what\nthis old boy can do when he's put to it. Well?\"\n\n\"By Saturn!\" An uncertain ring crept into the Atlantean Prince's\nvoice. \"A moment, while I address His Splendor.\"\n\n\"I'm a fool, a damn fool!\" thought Nelson. \"Still, it's Alden's only\nchance--unless the Jarmuthians've got some trick I'm not on to, I\nought to stand a fighting chance.\" Meanwhile Emperor and\nCaptain-General drew to one side, listening to Hero John's impassioned\noratory. That the idea met with disapproval, Nelson quietly recognized\nfrom the incredulous, even contemptuous, glances Altorius shot at him.\nLeaving the four sneering Jarmuthians under guard of the nobles, the\nEmperor came striding impatiently over the inlaid floor.\n\n\"What madness is this?\" he demanded harshly. \"Dost thou realize what\nwould hang upon thy skill? If thou shouldst fail, our annual hostage\nfor the divine Altara would be twelve instead of six of our maidens.\nFurther, the dog-conceived Jereboam would wax unbearably overweening\nand insolent. Nay, there is too much at hazard! Though outnumbered we\nwill give battle in the morning.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" demanded Nelson, in turn impatient. \"A fine chance you'd stand!\nWhy, less than half of your army is here at Cerium and Hero John tells\nme that the enemy have massed their entire forces on the salient of\nPoseidon. Isn't that so?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAltorius' handsome brow darkened. \"Aye,\" he admitted, \"but our\nreinforcing corps will come up before the third hour of the third\ndivision.\"\n\nHere Hero Giles broke in and, speaking with the quick, impassioned\ntones of one whose reactions are violent, pled for confidence in the\nAmerican. \"Nay, fair cousin,\" he replied, casting a sidewise look at\nthe Jarmuthians standing in muttered colloquy with their leader, who\nhad now gotten to his feet and was angrily dabbing the blood from his\nchin with the hem of his yellow kiltlike garment. \"I saw with mine own\neyes what miracles Friend Nelson doth perform with his curious\nnoise-making retortii. If Jereboam falls upon us ere our regiments are\nmarshaled, then, verily, are we doomed. We have no choice but to play\nfor time. Harken to the counsel of Hero John! Methinks this stranger\nfrom the Ice World is no braggart. He will fight well. If he loses he\ndies horribly--that he knows. The thought will strengthen his arms,\nand if he wins--!\"\n\nThen broke in Nelson firmly. \"If I win I must have the word of Your\nMajesty that Alden and I are to be afforded all help and free passage\nto that place where your soldiers captured my friend. It that\nunderstood?\"\n\nAltorius' blue eyes shifted and there was a slight hesitation in his\nmanner. Then, coming to a decision, he whirled and extended his hand.\n\n\"Good, 'tis agreed,\" he said. \"On my head be it. Have patience while\nHero Giles confers with these outlandish dogs.\"\n\nIt was with intense interest that the anxious aviator watched the\nensuing conference. He could see the four Jarmuthians listening, dark\neyes restlessly flitting back and forth, and their mouths twisted into\ncontemptuous half snarls. Then, as Nelson's offer was made clear, a\nlook of cunning seemed to creep into the eyes of the leader. He asked\nfor clarification of several points, then, being informed of the\ndetails, his thick lips parted in an evil, crafty grin.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTaken aback at the suspiciously ready acquiescence of the enemy, Hero\nGiles turned about. \"They agree,\" he translated, \"that, should Friend\nNelson win, they will return to their own land, they will forfeit the\nannual tribute forever and return the other stranger unharmed. They\nspeak fair, but I fear--\" He bit his lips in perplexity. \"These dogs,\nwho talk with the forked tongues of serpents, plan some snare, some\ncunning trickery.\"\n\n\"Repeat the terms.\" Altorius seemed gripped with apprehension too.\n\"Let all be clearly understood: at the third division of morning will\nthe wanderer fight six warriors. No more and no less.\"\n\nThis was agreed and reaffirmed. Then, with an insolent, triumphant\nlaugh, the Jarmuthian delegation whirled about and stalked from the\nroom, their dark greaved legs flashing in military unison over the\npolished floor.\n\n\"'Tis done,\" quoth Hero Giles gloomily. \"The encounter will take place\non the plain of Gilboa at the third hour of the third division. And\nmay Saturn help us if thy might fails. Friend Nelson! For then surely\nwill the hordes of Jarmuth despoil us and there will come a desolation\nand a darkness upon the Empire of Atlans.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nIt seemed incredibly soon that Victor Nelson found himself striding\nout from the serrated ranks of the Atlantean army which, drawn up in a\nrough diamond formation, looked discouragingly small in comparison to\nthat vast sea of helmets twinkling ominously across the plain of\nPoseidon amid a haze of bright yellow dust which climbed lazily into\nthe breathless heavens. The Jarmuthian army, numbering perhaps sixty\nor seventy thousand effective troops, lay encamped in a great salient\nformed by a convolution of the Apidanus and formed the only Jarmuthian\ntract of the great valley lying south of the boiling river.\n\nLike low-lying snow drifts, the sheen of the enemy tents struck\nNelson's eye as he strode over the bright green turf to battle for\nRichard Alden's life.\n\n\"There was something back of those nasty grins of the ambassadors,\" he\nreflected. \"I wonder what deviltry they're cooking up?\"\n\nHe glanced at a stalwart Atlantean herald who, nervous in the extreme,\nclutched his brazen, dolphin-shaped horn and followed in the\nAmerican's wake together with a sad little company. Weeping, moaning\nand dressed in plain black robes marched six really lovely girls--they\nwho would perish on Beelzebub's altar if Nelson failed. Bitter were\nthe looks of the guards as they secured the hands of the victims and\nmany the hopeful look cast at the impassive American when they turned\nback, leaving the helpless girls to their fate.\n\nThe ground where the one-sided duel was to take place was marked off\nby means of little yellow flags on a level plain perhaps a quarter of\na mile long and wide. Arriving on the nearest border Nelson briefly\nmotioned the herald to halt.\n\n\"Might as well start shooting at the best range possible, and beat\ntheir steam throwers,\" he decided. \"Wish to the devil I'd a few more\ncartridges. Only thirteen shots between me and Beelzeebub's altar in\nJezreel, so I'd better not miss. All right, son, toot your horn.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith his thumb be gestured the command, whereupon the Atlantean nodded\neagerly and, filling his chest, set horn to lips to blow a long,\nstrident note that rang harshly, boldly out over the great plain.\n\nWhile the note of the challenge rang out, Nelson's eyes turned back to\nregard the Atlantean array and detected, far in the rear, a huge\npillar of dust which must mark the progress of the Atlantean\nreinforcements. Would they arrive at Cierum in time? Then his eyes\nsought that spot where Altorius and his staff sat anxiously on their\npodokos, watching intently the impending struggle. Very clearly the\nflash of their armor came to him.\n\n\"I guess, like the girls back there, they're kind of nervous and\njumpy,\" thought Nelson. \"Well, I don't blame them. I've had quieter\nmoments myself.\"\n\nHaving blown three blasts, the Atlantean herald saluted; then, with\ndisconcerting haste, made his way back to the ranks of his fellows\nsome two hundred yards away.\n\nFrom the Jarmuthian army came an answering blast. Nelson cast a last\nlook on the Atlantean army, breathlessly awaiting the impending duel.\nThere was the allosauri corps on the far left; he could see the\nchimeric monsters' long, repulsive necks writhing endlessly back and\nforth through the air as they squealed and tugged strongly at their\nrestraining chains. On the right were stationed perhaps ten thousand\npodokesons, their slender, yellow-shafted lances swaying like a\nsapling forest in the distance. In the center were eleven thousand\nprotection infantry, green-crested and armed with compact tanks of\nblue-maxima vapor, fungus bombs and swords. Behind them, and\ncorresponding to heavy infantry, were ranged some twenty thousand\nblue-plumed hoplites, eagerly fingering the brazen hoses of their\ndeath dealing portable retortii.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNelson had no time to further study the array, for he whirled about as\nfrom the Atlantean army arose a deep, horrified shout. He stood\nparalyzed, his jaw slack. For there, waddling slowly forward, came the\nmost fantastic huge creature imaginable. Unspeakably repellent and\nhorrible, it stood on short legs thick as mature trees, to tower at\nleast thirty-five feet above the ground at the fore-shoulders! An\nimmense reptilian neck some twenty-five feet long weaved continuously\nback and forth, while a surprisingly small, bullet-shaped head emitted\nrumbling grunts.\n\n\"Great God!\" gasped the horrified aviator, and felt the ground sway\nunder him. \"It must be ninety feet long!\"\n\nParalyzed by a dreadful fascination he watched the ungainly, hill-like\nreptile shuffle ponderously forward and realized that, high on its\nback, was fixed a small fort, rather like those howdahs or boxes which\nare fastened to the backs of elephants. Chilled with the nearness of\ndeath, Nelson counted six mail-clad warriors in the howdah. Then the\ntrue import of the Jarmuthians evil jest struck him with full force.\n\n\"Six men, they said. And six men there are--but the treacherous devils\nmounted them on that walking hill-side! Guess Altorius can kiss his\nsix girls good-by right now. Poor Alden! Well, I did my best--a rotten\ntrick.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt that moment he felt as an ant must feel on beholding the approach\nof a human. It was terrifying, the inexorable advance of that\ncolossal, fantastic monster. From behind he could hear the infuriated\nshouts of the Atlantean army. They knew even he could not hope to\nwithstand the murderous onslaught of the beast now entering the\nduelling space.\n\nOn came the diplodocus, its vast warty tail trailing over the ground\nand raising a heavy column of dust, while its mud smeared sides bore\nout Hero Giles' statement that here was one of those semi-aquatic\ntitans from the steaming swamps of Jarmuth.\n\n\"Hell! Poor Alden's as good as finished now! What a fool I was to\nthink I could save him!\"\n\nObedient to an overwhelming fear, Nelson whirled to flee, then\nstopped, as, from the depths of his being, a stronger power forbade\nhim to desert his friend to certain death.\n\n\"Range two hundred and fifty yards,\" he estimated, and, whipping up\nthe Winchester, sighted full at the ponderous creature's slimy\nsnakelike head. When the recoil jarred his shoulder, Nelson dropped\nthe barrel an inch or so to watch. Nothing happened. The great beast\nwas advancing as before, its incredibly long neck weaving steadily\nback and forth as though to sniff the air.\n\n\"Hell!\"\n\nStruck by a sudden thought, he snatched a cartridge from his pocket\nand, with that strength which comes to men in their hour of mortal\nperil, wrenched out the metal-jacketed bullet, to reinsert it\nbackwards into the brass cartridge case.\n\nMeanwhile the vast brute had drawn nearer, crushing flat a young oak\nin its path as easily as though it had been a wheat stalk.\n\n\"Maybe this dum-dum will do some good,\" panted Nelson. \"If it doesn't,\nnothing will stop it!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAgain he sighted until, finding those small, orange red eyes in line\nwith his sight, he fired. This time the gray-brown monster uttered a\ntitantic bellow of rage, halted, and began shaking its clumsy blunt\nhead.\n\n\"Hit it, by God!\" exulted Nelson, and seized the momentary respite to\nslip two fresh cartridges into the Winchester's magazine.\n\nBut, to his inexpressible dismay, the monster presently resumed its\nponderous progress while the Jarmuthians in the howdah uttered\ntaunting yells that reached him faintly, while the sun flares glinted\non their brandished swords and lances. One of them plucked a fungus\ngrenade from his belt and flung it with all his might in Nelson's\ndirection. The missile fell to the earth far short of its destination\nand seemed to break rather than explode, at the same time expelling\nthat deadly, greenish-yellow vapor which, blown away by a strong wind,\nfortunately came nowhere near the doomed aviator.\n\n\"Oh! You will?\"\n\nNelson sighted swiftly at the grenade-thrower and fired, whereupon the\nJarmuthian, some hundred and fifty yards distant, spun crazily about,\nflung both arms towards the amber-yellow sky and toppled from the\nhowdah, for all the world like a diver in quest of pearls.\n\nFrom both breathless armies rose a terrific shout. Accustomed as they\nwere to the visible destruction of the retortii, this noisy yet\ninvisible death was appalling.\n\nBut Nelson's agonized attention was not on the assembled armies, for\nnearer came the mountainous diplodocus, its lumbering strides making\nthe howdah sway like a ship in a gale and preventing use of the\nportable retortii.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNelson planted both feet, took fresh grip on his waning courage and\nshot again, this time aiming at a gigantic, black bearded warrior who\nseemed to be training one of those portable retortii upon him.\n\nAgain the Winchester cracked and this time the black bearded man sank\nfrom sight back into the howdah, while his companions, uttering\nvengeful shouts, tossed more fungus bombs at the lone heroic figure\nbarring their progress towards the six bound and shrieking maidens.\n\nTowering thrice as high as the largest African elephant, the\ndiplodocus was now but seventy-five yards away. He had hit it, that\nNelson could tell, for a large shower of blood sprayed from the\nmonster's neck. Then, uttering a despairing curse, he sent a shot\nsmacking squarely into the left shoulder, at the base of that mastlike\nneck with fervent hope of finding the heart. But the heavy bullet\nbothered the cyclopean reptile no more than a sting of a mosquito.\n\nOn, on it came. In another minute it must stamp out Victor Nelson's\nlife beneath feet as large as hogsheads.\n\n\"Damn!\"\n\nNelson snapped the ejector lever, throwing out the spent cartridge.\n\n\"No use,\" he whispered, \"can't faze that hill of meat! But I might as\nwell kill all of those bloody cannibals I can.\"\n\nWith amazing speed and accuracy he picked off two of the remaining\nJarmuthians, whose shining, bronze armor could nowise withstand the\nwicked impact of modern nickel-jacketed bullets. One of the stricken\nmen for a moment dangled with the last of his strength from one of the\nchains securing the howdah to the enormous creature's back, then\ntumbled heavily some forty feet to the earth.\n\nOnly two shots more in the magazine--! Nelson suddenly found himself\nvery cool. \"Two shots and then--\"\n\nHe was conscious of that great, snakelike head darting viciously in\nhis direction. A huge, slobbering mouth, studded with teeth a foot\nlong, yawned redly before him like a nightmare incarnate, blotting out\nconsciousness of all else. Then Victor Nelson, fighting to control his\nstrumming nerves, deliberately sighted into a great, orange colored\neye, saw the narrow black iris over the Winchester's front sight and\nknew the huge warty head was not ten feet away.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe pressed the trigger and never heard the report, but felt the blast\nof a furnace-hot breath in his face--a breath that stank like the foul\nreek of burning rubber.\n\nWith a detached sense of surprise he saw the eye miraculously and\ndreadfully disintegrate; then, as the bitter smell of burned cordite\nstung his nostrils, he sprang violently sidewise to find himself\nstaring up at the howdah, now towering at least forty feet above.\n\nThe next few moments were indescribable. Horrible roars and bellows,\nloud as those of a thousand angered bulls, shattered the air. The\ndiplodocus halted, stunned by pain and the partial loss of eyesight;\nthen, its infinitesimal brain becoming gripped with fear, it plunged\nand lumbered sidewise, nearly shaking the warriors from the howdah,\nwhere they clung for dear life. Nelson was barely able to avoid the\nsweep of the powerful tail as the diplodocus wheeled about on hind\nlegs, reeled and started blindly back towards the Jarmuthian ranks.\nSuddenly it stood stock still, shaking with super-elephantine motions.\nThen, for all the world like a balky mule, it sank to the earth and\ncowered there, despite the frantic efforts of the surviving\nJarmuthians to stir it to obedience.\n\nBy the strong amber light of the sun flare Nelson had a vision of the\nlast two warriors swinging in apelike agility to the ground. They were\ngiants, those two men of Jarmuth, and their conical helmets added\nadditional stature. One of them, shouting an unintelligible taunt,\nreached for his belt to snatch out a fungus bomb, but Nelson, dropping\non one knee, sent a bullet crashing between the Jarmuthian's scowling\neyes. Even as he fell, the last of the six champions unwisely ignored\nhis retortii and frantically sprang forward, razor-edged sword\nupraised.\n\nNelson frantically worked the ejector lever but only an empty click\nresulted! His heart sank. \"Hell! the magazine's empty!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe had just time to swing the Winchester about and grasp its barrel as\nthe Jarmuthian, with a loud shout, sprang in, slashing viciously at\nNelson's unprotected neck. Using the clubbed rifle like a baseball\nbat, the American struck out with the strength of despair. There came\na resonant clang as blade and barrel encountered each other. Steel is\never stronger than bronze, so Nelson had the satisfaction of seeing\nthe Jarmuthian's sword blade break squarely in two near the hilt.\n\nHorrified, the black bearded warrior glanced at the empty hilt in his\nhand but, courageous to the end, sprang in like a tiger to grapple\nwith that small, agile man in khaki and serge.\n\n\"You would--eh?\" gasped Nelson.\n\nPutting all his strength behind a blow he whirled up the heavy\nWinchester, struck out and felt the solid walnut stock smash fair and\nsquare on the conical helmet. Like an eggshell the bronze helm broke\nand the six-pointed star above went spinning off into the dust. As a\ntree sways before it falls beneath a forester's ax, so the dark\nJarmuthian giant tottered, while the wide dusty plain of Poseidon\nechoed with a rumbling, incredulous shout.\n\n\"There,\" choked Nelson, incredulous to be still alive, \"I guess\nthat'll be about all for to-day.\"\n\nBut he was wrong. From the ranks of Jarmuth rose a terrible, ominous\ncry and at the same time there broke out the sibilant hiss of a\nthousand retortii. From the Atlantean army came an answering yell and\nNelson turned to race back to the shelter of Altorius' body-guard,\npausing but to arouse the terrified hostages. Swiftly he cast loose\ntheir bonds and pointed to the nearest detachment of Atlanteans.\nSobbing with joy the six girls fled for dear life just as the first of\nthe allosauri went racing over the plains. Screaming, all-powerful and\nuncanny war dogs, they bounded grotesquely high in the air, plunging\nstraight towards the Jarmuthian ranks which greeted them with a\nsearing, billowing blast of their retortii. Though dozens of the\nterrible creatures fell kicking and writhing beneath the scalding\ndischarge of the retortii, the main body, perhaps forty or fifty in\nnumber, sprang like rending fiends into the dense packed masses of\nJarmuthian infantry.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOf the ensuing battle, Nelson had but the most confused recollections.\nThe dominating impression was that the fray was awesome, horrible\nbeyond power of description. He recalled feeding the five remaining\ncartridges into the magazine, then clapping on an Atlantean noble's\nhelmet. With Hero John at his side he joined in an furious headlong\ncharge of the podoko corps.\n\nLike a vast glittering wedge the gallant Atlantean lancers advanced\nunder shelter of the blue maxima vapor which, discharged by the\nprotectons or light infantry, dispelled the scalding steam clouds\nlaunched from the Jarmuthian portable retortii.\n\n\"Halor v\u00e0n!\" Hero John shouted the Atlantean war cry. \"Halor v\u00e0n!\nCome Friend Nelson, this day shall the treacherous swine of Jarmuth\ndrown in their own blood! Halor v\u00e0n!\"\n\nNelson replied nothing. He was too busy drawing a bead on a gorgeously\narrayed enemy officer who appeared to be directing the defence.\n\nFaster and faster rushed the podokos, forty, fifty miles an hour, a\ncarnate thunderbolt hurled straight at the enemy center. Under a hot\nfire of grenades dozens of the lancers fell and once, when a fungus\nbomb broke near by, Nelson saw half a dozen Atlanteans tumble from\ntheir saddles, the hideous yellow growths already sprouting from\nnostrils, mouth and ears. The turmoil became deafening,\nindescribable--like the roar of a crowded subway.\n\nThe American had a brief glimpse of a mountainous diplodocus assailed\nby half a dozen hissing, shrieking allosauri who, employing jaws and\nclaws, ripped great, shuddering chucks of flesh from the agonized and\nunwieldy monster on whose back the frantic Jarmuthians fought with\nterrible ferocity.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs agile as grasshoppers, those fierce war dogs ripped and worried\ntheir prey. One of them clung like a bulldog to the doomed diplodocus'\nhead, though the twenty-foot neck writhed and whirled frantically in\neffort to shake it loose. Another allosaurus, whining with eagerness,\nactually clambered up the back of an assailed giant only to fall back\nunder the blast of a retortii mounted in the howdah. Bathed in live\nsteam, with bones showing through its melting, quivering flesh, the\nallosaurus collapsed backwards, but another instantly took its place\nand, gaining its goal with a terrific leap, made a shambles of the\nhowdah, tearing the men in it apart as a lion does an antelope.\n\nNelson found himself very busy. The charging podokesos were now in the\nmidst of the Jarmuthian heavy infantry, slashing down at a maze of\nyelling, black-bearded, Semitic faces. Once Nelson was nearly\nspeared, shooting his assailant just as the lance glimmered over his\nheart. Again he saw the Atlantean hoplites beaten back amid a\npestilential fog of fungus gas which stretched them in kicking,\nloathsome heaps on the dusty plain. The uproar became terrific,\nindescribable, as the whistling screams of the allosauri and the\nsaurean bellows of the diplodoci rose above the shouts of the soldiery\nto fill the dust-laden air with a dreadful clamor. The battle now\nswayed critically; a feather's weight on either side and one army\nwould roll back in red, irretrievable ruin. It was the psychological\ninstant. Nelson sensed it unerringly.\n\n\"Look!\" shouted Hero John, dashing a rivulet of blood from his eyes,\n\"there fights the dog-begotten Jereboam himself! Halor v\u00e0n! Smite, ye\nsoldiers of Atlans! Smite!\"\n\nFollowing the line of the outstretched hand. Nelson caught a glimpse\nof an enormous, eagle nosed warrior who, clad in gleaming, diamond\nstudded harness, fought like a paladin of old. Powerful as a dark Ares\nthe sable browed Jereboam raged among the dismayed Atlantean hoplites,\nbeating them to earth with terrible ferocity.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a long shot, one he might readily have been forgiven in missing\nbut with the speed of thought Victor Nelson sprang from his podoko,\ndropped on one knee behind a pile of corpses and, uttering a fervent\nprayer, fired full at Jereboam's black head.\n\nThe nearest combatants drew back momentarily at the unfamiliar thunder\nof the report and fell silent while the groans and shrieks of the\nwounded rose loud. As a man looking through many thickness of glass,\nso Nelson saw Jereboam reel on his splendidly caparisoned podoko,\nclasp both hands to his forehead and sink to earth.\n\nHero Giles, somewhere far in the Atlantean van, saw what transpired\nand capitalized it with the inspiration of a genius.\n\n\"Jereboam is dead!\" he shouted in ringing tones, and flashed his red\nstained sword. \"Woe to Jarmuth this day! Smite, ye sons of Atlans. Woe\nto Jarmuth--Jereboam is fallen!\"\n\nAnd smite hard the reinforced Atlanteans did. Filled with a new\ncourage they advanced so determinedly that the disconcerted and\ndismayed Jarmuthians broke and fled in a disastrous, panic-stricken\nrout back over the plain of Poseidon towards the boiling river.\n\nThe ground was already carpeted with dead and with abandoned\nequipment, when fresh packs of allosauri were loosed on the fleeing\nJarmuthians to wreak havoc indescribable and, ere long, only the\ntriumphant, panting Atlanteans remained on the field.\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nThere was music and high revelry in the fortress of Cierum that night,\nand Victor Nelson, embarrassed and flushed with the extravagant\nadoration of all Atlans, sat by the Emperor Altorius' side waiting,\nwatching for the appearance of a humbled Jarmuthian delegation.\n\n\"Never since the world began has there been such a hero in Atlans!\"\ncried Altorius, his face more Roman than ever. \"Prithee tarry amongst\nus, Hero Nelson. Thou shalt be as my brother. A marble palace shalt\nthou have and twenty wives, each fair as those damsels which thou\nhast, by thy might, rescued from the profane altar of the fiend,\nBeelzebub!\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" laughed Nelson, and drained a goblet of tawny wine. \"I'd be\ndelighted to stay, but the point is--He broke off short, for there\ncame a sudden tramp of feet at the door of the great hall and there,\njust visible above the green crests of the royal guards, he recognized\nthat pale, drawn face which had haunted him ever since he had returned\nto find the abandoned aeroplane.\n\n\"Dick!\" he shouted. \"Dick Alden!\"\n\n\"Nelson!\"\n\nWith that same irresistible form which had won a certain November\nclassic for Harvard, Richard Alden bucked and plunged through a double\nrank of startled guards and came running across the marble floor, his\neyes lit with an unspeakable gladness.\n\n\"Nelson! Nelson!\" he panted. \"What in hell are you doing up there?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" replied the aviator with a joyous grin, \"just visiting with my\nfriend, the Emperor.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAlden halted, on his handsome features a curious mixture of surprise\nand delight. \"The Emperor?\" he stammered. \"You sitting beside an\nEmperor?\"\n\n\"Would it not seem so?\" inquired Altorius with a low laugh.\n\n\"It would,\" chuckled Alden. \"Victor Nelson, as I remember, always was\na good politician.\"\n\n\"And,\" thought Nelson, \"I'll have to be a damn sight better one to get\nus out of Atlans without injuring Altorius' feelings. I don't suppose\nhe'll ever be able to realize that all the desirable things in the\nworld don't lie in this valley.\"\n\nThrongs of brilliantly armored and plumed officers and courtiers, some\nof them nursing wounds and bandaged heads, came up to hail the mighty\nwanderer who had subdued the might of Jarmuth.\n\nFlushed and pleased, as is any normal man under well-earned praise,\nNelson shook one wiry fist after another, while Alden chatted with the\nEmperor. Nobles, officers and courtiers all pressed close to fawn upon\nthe new hero--but, far back in the council chamber, a group of dark\nrobed priests were crowded together. Haranguing the priests was a\nfierce, white bearded old man who seemed to be arguing violently.\n\n\"Hum!\" thought the American. \"That's at least one outfit that doesn't\nlike the way I part my hair. Wonder what devilment the priests are\ncooking up?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was not long in finding out, for the black robed arch-priest\nsuddenly left his group of underlings to boldly make his way forward,\nwhile princes, courtiers and warriors drew respectfully aside and bent\ntheir heads.\n\n\"Hail! All conquering Emperor!\" The stern old man halted squarely\nbefore Altorius' gem encrusted throne, while Alden checked some remark\nto look curiously down upon the hawk-featured arch-priest.\n\nAltorius flushed and the lines about his mouth tightened, from which\nNelson guessed that there was more than a little bad blood between the\nspiritual and temporal heads of the empire.\n\n\"What wouldst thou, oh Heracles?\"\n\n\"I would know why the all powerful Wanderer, of whom thou makest so\nmuch, did not rescue Princess Altara?\"\n\nThe Emperor stiffened. \"Her rescue, being impossible of\naccomplishment, was not nominated in the agreement,\" he said coldly.\n\"The Wanderer has in full carried out his share--and so shall we.\nHonored and beloved of Atlans, these great warriors shall abide among\nus in peace.\"\n\nHere Nelson thought it wise to dispel any illusions Altorius might\nentertain about their staying in Atlans. \"No, oh Splendor: remember,\nour agreement was that, should I conquer the Jarmuthian champions,\nAlden and I were to be allowed to go free.\"\n\n\"Nay, oh Splendor,\" fiercely broke in the arch-priest, \"permit them\nnot to go. I tell thee the Princess Altara _must_ be restored to\nAtlans! Else,\"--a distinct note of threat crept into the old man's\nvoice--\"--else evil days shall fall upon this empire, and the line of\nHudson will wither and fade.\"\n\nUp sprang Altorius in a towering rage. \"Sirrah! Dost dare make threats\nto thy liege lord?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFire flashed from the young Emperor's bright blue eyes, and under\ntheir fierce glare the old man quailed and stepped back with eyes\nlowered.\n\n\"Altorius keeps his word,\" the Emperor thundered. \"The strangers shall\ngo, though all the black-robed kites in the realm say me nay. The word\nof a Hudsonian prince is as sure as the fire of Pelion. Get thee gone,\nrash priest!\"\n\nA long moment, the two strangely contrasting figures glared at each\nother, the young, splendid Emperor and the malevolent, withered old\nman.\n\n\"The Gods demand their daughter,\" cried Heracles in parting, \"and woe\nto him who says them nay!\"\n\nWith this parting shot, the arch-priest turned and, scarlet faced,\nstalked from the council room, while Altorius threw back his head and\nroared with laughter.\n\n\"Come, oh ye Heroes, ye princes and captains! Come, let us make\nfestival before these mighty wanderers go their way!\"\n\nRoar upon roar of enthusiasm echoed through the marble throne room,\nand Nelson would have felt wholly at ease had not that little knot of\npriests remained gathered like ill-omened carrion crows about the\ndoor. Muttering among themselves, they were watching him with a\ncurious intentness that aroused deep misgivings in the American's\nmind, and it was with something like a sigh that he joined the\nprocession forming to proceed to the triumphal feast on which the\nwealth and luxury of the whole empire of Atlans had been lavished.\n\n(_To be continued._)\n\n[Illustration: Advertisement.]\n\n\n\n\nThe Pirate Planet\n\n_By Charles W. Diffin_\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n[Illustration: _He shot feet first into the waiting heads._]\n\n[Sidenote: From Earth and sub-Venus converge a titanic offensive of\njustice on the unspeakable man-things of Torg.]\n\n\nThe little ship that Captain Blake had thrown with reckless speed\nthrough the skies over Washington, D. C., made history that day in the\nrecords of the earth. None, now, could doubt that here, at last, was\nthe answer that the world had hoped for until hope had died.\nUnbelievable in its field of action, incredible in its wild speed, but\nreal, nevertheless!--the countries of the earth were frantic in their\nacclaim. Only the men who formed the International Board of Defense\nfailed to join in the enthusiasm. They sat by day and night in earnest\nconference on ways and means.\n\nThis little ship--so wonderful, and so inadequate! It was only a\npromise of what might come. There must be new designs made; men must\nlearn to dream in new terms and set down their dreams in cold lines\nand figures on drafting boards. A cruiser of space must be designed,\nto mount heavy guns, carry great loads, absorb the stresses that must\ncome to such a structure in flight and in battle. And above all, it\nmust take the thrust of this driving force--new and tremendous--of\nwhich men knew so little as yet. And then many like it must be built.\n\nThe fuel must be prepared, and this, alone, meant new and different\nmachinery, which itself must be designed before the manufacturing\nprocess could begin.\n\nThere was work to be done--a world of work!--and so few months in\nwhich to do it. The attack from the distant gun had long since ceased\nand the instruments of the astronomers showed the enemy planet\nshrinking far off in space. But it would return; there was only a year\nfor preparation.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCaptain Blake was assigned to the direction of design. An entire\noffice building in Washington was vacated for his use, and in a few\nhours he rallied a staff of assistants who demanded the entire use of\na telephone system that spread countrywide. And the call went out that\nwould bring the best brains of the land to the task before them.\n\nThe windows of the building shone brightly throughout the nights when\nthe call was answered, and engineers and draftsmen worked at fever\nheat on thrusts and stresses and involved mathematical calculations.\nAnd, while owners of great manufacturing plants waited with\nunaccustomed patience for a moment's talk with Blake, the white sheets\non the drafting boards showed growing pictures of braces and struts\nand curved plates, of castings for gun mounts, and ammunition hoists.\nAnd the manufacturers were told in no uncertain terms exactly what\npart of this experimental ship they would produce, and when it must be\ndelivered.\n\n\"If only we dared go into production,\" said Blake; \"but it is out of\nthe question. This first ship must demonstrate its efficiency; we must\nget the 'bugs' out of our design; correct our errors and be ready with\na production schedule that will work with precision.\"\n\nOnly one phase of this proposed production troubled him; the\nmanufacture must be handled all over the world. He talked with men\nfrom England and France, from Germany and Italy and a host of other\nlands, and he raged inwardly while he tried to drive home to them the\nnecessity for handling the work in just one way--his way--if results\nwere to be achieved.\n\nThe men of business he could convince, but his chief disquiet came\nfrom those whose thoughts were of what they termed \"statesmanship,\"\nand who seemed more apprehensive of the power that this new weapon\nwould give the United States of America than they were of the threat\nfrom distant worlds.\n\nFrom his friends in high quarters came hints of the same friction, but\nhe knew that the one demand Winslow had laid down was being observed:\nthe secret of the mysterious fuel would remain with us. Winslow had\nshown little confidence in the countries of the old world, and he had\nsworn Blake to an agreement that his strange liquids--that new form of\nmatter and substance--should remain with this country.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd swiftly the paper ship grew. The parts were in manufacture, and\narriving at the assembly plant in Ohio. Blake's time was spent there\nnow, and he caught only snatches of sleep on a cot in his office,\nwhile he worked with the forces of men who succeeded each other to\nkeep the assembly room going night and day.\n\nThere was an enormous hangar that was designed for the assembling of a\ngiant dirigible; it housed another ship now. Hardly a ship, yet it\nbegan to take form where great girders held the keel that was laid,\nand duralumin plates and strong castings were bolted home.\n\nA thousand new problems, and innumerable vexing errors--the \"bugs\"\nthat inhere with a new, mechanical job--yet the day came when the ship\nwas a thing of sleek beauty, and her thousand feet of length enclosed\na maze of latticed struts where ammunition rooms and sleeping\nquarters, a chart room and control stations were cleverly interspaced.\nAnd above, where the great shape towered high in the big hangar, were\nthe lean snouts of cannon, and recesses that held rapid-fire guns and\nwhole batteries of machine guns for close range.\n\nRows of great storage batteries were installed, to furnish the first\ncurrent for the starting of the ship, till her dynamos that were\ndriven by the exhaust blast itself could go into action and carry on.\nAnd then--\n\nAn armored truck that ground slowly up under heavy guard to deliver\ntwo small flasks of liquid whose tremendous weight must be held in\ncontainers of thick steel, and be hoisted with cranes to their resting\nplace within the ship. And Captain Blake, with his heart in his throat\nthrough fear of some failure, some slip in their plans--Captain Blake,\nof the gaunt, worn frame, and face haggard from sleepless\nnights--stood quietly at a control board while the great doors of the\nhangar swung open.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt the closing of a switch the current from the batteries flowed\nthrough the two liquids, to go on in conductors of heavy copper to a\ngenerator that was heavy and squat and devoid of moving parts. Within\nit were electrodes that were castings of copper, and between them the\nmiracle of regenerated matter was taking place.\n\nWhat came to them as energy from the cables was transformed to a\ntangible thing--a vast bulk of gas, of hydrogen and oxygen that had\nonce been water, and the pressure of the gas made a roaring inferno of\nthe exhausts. A spark plug ignited it, and the heat of combustion\nadded pressure to pressure, while the quivering, invisible live steam\npoured forth to change to vaporous clouds that filled the hangar.\n\nThe man at the control board stood trembling with knowledge of the\npower he had unleashed. He moved a lever to crack open a valve, and\nthe clouds poured now from beneath the ship, that raised slowly and\nsmoothly in the air. It hung quietly poised, while the hands that\ndirected it sent a roaring blast from the great stern exhaust, and the\ncreation of many minds became a thing of life that moved slowly,\ngliding out into the sunlight of the world.\n\nThe cheers of crowding men, insane with hysterical emotion at sight of\ntheir work's fulfillment, were lost in the thunder of the ship. The\nblunt bow lifted where the sun made dazzling brilliance of her\nsweeping curves, and with a blast that thundered from her stern the\nfirst unit of the space forces of the Earth swept upward in an arc of\nspeed that ended in invisibility. No enveloping air could hold her\nnow; she was launched in the ocean of space that would be her home.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCaptain Blake, the following day, sat in Washington before a desk\npiled high with telegrams of congratulation. His tired face was\nsmiling as he replaced a telephone receiver that had spoken words of\nconfidence and commendation from the President of the United States.\nBut he pushed the mass of yellow papers aside to resume his\nexamination of a well-thumbed folder marked: \"Production Schedule.\"\nThe real work was yet to be done.\n\nIt was only two short months later that he sat before the same desk,\nwith a face that showed no mark of smiles in its haggard lines.\n\nHis ship was a success, and was flying continuously, while men of the\nair service were trained in its manipulation and gunners received\npractice in three-dimensioned range finding and cruiser practice in\nthe air. Above, in the airless space, they learned to operate the guns\nthat were controlled from within the air-tight rooms. They were\nlearning, and the ship performed the miracles that were now taken as\nmatters of fact.\n\nBut production!\n\nCaptain Blake rose wearily to attend a conference at the War\nDepartment. He had asked that it be called, and the entire service was\nrepresented when he reached there. He went without preamble or\nexplanation to the point.\n\n\"Mr. Secretary,\" he said, and faced the Secretary of War, \"I have to\nreport, sir, that we have failed. It is utterly impossible, under\npresent conditions, to produce a fleet of completed ships.\n\n\"You know the reason; I have conferred with you often. It was a\nmistake to depend on foreign aid; they have failed us. I do not\ncriticize them: their ways are their own, and their own problems loom\nlarge to them. The English production of parts has come through, or is\nproceeding satisfactorily, but the rest is in hopeless confusion. The\nRed menace from Russia is the prime reason, of course. With the Reds\nmobilizing their forces, we cannot blame her neighbors for preparing\nto defend themselves. But our program!--and the sure invasion that\nwill come in six short months!--to be fighting among ourselves--it is\ndamnable!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe paused to stare in wordless misery at the silent gathering before\nhim. Then--\n\n\"I have failed,\" he blurted out. \"I have fallen down on the job. It\nwas my responsibility to get the cooperation that insured success.\nLet me step aside. Is there anyone now who can take up the work and\nbring order and results from this chaos of futility?\"\n\nHe waited long for a reply. It was the Secretary of War who answered\nin a quiet voice.\n\n\"We must not be too harsh,\" he said, \"in our criticism of our foreign\nfriends, but neither should we be unfair to Captain Blake. You do\nyourself an injustice; there is no one who could have done more than\nyou. The reason is here.\" He struck at a paper that he held in his\nhand. \"Europe is at war. Russia has struck without warning; her troops\nare moving and her air force is engaged this minute in an attack upon\nParis. It is a traitor country at home that has defeated us in our war\nwith another world.\"\n\n\"I think,\" he added slowly, \"there is nothing more that could have\nbeen done: you have made a brave effort. Let us thank you, Captain\nBlake, while we can. We will fight, when the time comes, as best we\ncan; that goes without saying.\"\n\nA blue and gold figure arose slowly to speak a word for the navy. \"It\nis evident by Captain Blake's own admission, that the proposed venture\nmust fail. It has been evident to some of us from the start.\" It was a\nfighter of the old school who was speaking; his voice was that of one\nwhose vision has dimmed, who sees but the dreams of impractical\nvisionaries in the newer inventions, and whose reliance for safety is\nplaced only in the weapons he knows.\n\n\"The naval forces of the United States will be ready,\" he told them,\n\"and I would ask you to remember that we can still place dependence\nupon the ships that float in the water, and the forces who have manned\nthem since the history of this country began.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCaptain Blake had sprung to his feet. Again he addressed the Secretary\nfor War.\n\n\"Mr. Secretary,\" he said, and there was a fighting glint in his eyes,\n\"I make no reply to this gentleman. His arm of the service will speak\nfor itself as it has always done. But your own words have given me new\nhope and new energy. I ask you, Mr. Secretary, for another chance. The\nindustrial forces of the United States are behind us to the last man\nand the last machine. I have talked with them. I know!\n\n\"We have only six months left for a prodigious effort. Shall we make\nit? For the safety of our country and the whole world let us attempt\nthe impossible: go ahead on our own; turn the energy and the mind of\nthis whole country to the problem.\n\n\"The great fleet of the world can never be. Shall we build and launch\nthe Great Fleet of the United States, and take upon our own shoulders\nthe burden and responsibility of defense?\n\n\"It cannot be done by reasonable standards, but the time is past for\nreason. Possible or otherwise, we must do it. We will--if you will\nback me in the effort!\"\n\nThere was a rising discord of excited voices in the room. Men were\nleaping to their feet to shake vehement fists in the faces of those\nwho wagged their heads in protest. The Secretary of War arose to still\nthe storm. He turned to walk toward the waiting figure of Captain\nBlake.\n\n\"You can't do it,\" he said, and gripped the Captain by the hand; \"you\ncan't do it--but you may. This country has seen others who have done\nthe impossible when the impossible had to be done. It's your job; the\nPresident will confirm my orders. Go to it, Blake!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nThe wires that bound the two men were removed, and McGuire and Sykes\nworked in agony to bring life back to the hands and feet that were\nswollen and blue. Then--red guards who forced them to stumble on their\nnumbed legs, where darting pains made them set their lips tight--a\ncar that went swiftly through the darkness of a tube to stop finally\nin another building--a room with metal walls, one window with a\nbalcony beyond, high above the ground--a door that clanged behind\nthem; and the two men, looking one at the other with dismayed and\nswollen eyes, knew in their hearts that here, beyond a doubt, was\ntheir last earthly habitation.\n\nThey said nothing--there was nothing of hope or comfort to be\nsaid--and they dropped soddenly upon the hard floor, where finally the\nheavy breathing and nervous starts of Professor Sykes showed that to\nhim at least had come the blessed oblivion of exhausted sleep. But\nthere was no sleep for Lieutenant McGuire.\n\nThere was a face that shone too clearly in the dark, and his thoughts\nrevolved endlessly in words of reproach for his folly in allowing\nAlthora's love to lead her to share his risk. From the night outside\ntheir window came a ceaseless clatter and hubbub, but to this he was\noblivious.\n\nOnly with the coming of morning's soft golden light did McGuire know\nthe reason for the din and activity that echoed from outside--and the\nreason, too, for their being placed in this room.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTheir lives should end with the sailing of the fleet, and there,\noutside their window, were the ships themselves. Ships everywhere, as\nfar as he could see across the broad level expanse, and an army of men\nwho scurried like ants--red ones, who worked or directed the others,\nand countless blues and yellows who were loading the craft with\nenormous cargoes.\n\n\"Squawk, damn you!\" said Lieutenant McGuire to the distant shrieking\nthrong; \"and I hope they're ready for you when you reach the earth.\"\nBut his savage voice carried no conviction. What was there that Earth\ncould do to meet this overwhelming assault?\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Sykes. He roused from his sleep to work gingerly\nat his aching muscles, then came and stood beside McGuire.\n\n\"They have put us here as a final taunt,\" McGuire told him. \"There is\nthe fleet that is going to make our world into a nice little hell, and\nTorg, the beast! has put us here to see it leave. Then we get ours,\nand they don't know that we know that.\"\n\n\"Your first way was the best,\" the scientist observed; \"we should have\ndone it then. We still can.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" The flyer's voice was dull and lifeless.\n\nSykes pointed to the little balcony and the hard pavement below.\n\n\"Althora,\" he said, and McGuire winced at the name, \"seemed to think\nthat we were in for some exquisite torture. Here is the way out. It is\na hundred-foot drop; they think we are safe; but they have been\nunintentionally kind.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" his companion agreed, \"they don't know that we know of the torture.\nWe will wait ... and when I am sure that--Althora--is--gone ... when there\nis nothing I can do to help--\"\n\n\"Help?\" queried the professor gently. \"There is nothing now of help,\nnor anyone who can help us. We must face it, my boy; _c'est fini_. Our\nlittle journey is approaching its end.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was no reply, and McGuire stood throughout the day to stare with\neyes of smouldering hatred where the scurrying swarms of living things\nmade ready to invade and infest the earth.\n\nFood and water was pushed through the doorway, but he ate sparingly of\nthe odd-colored fruits; the only thing that could hold his thoughts\nfrom the hopeless repetition of unanswerable \"whys\" was the sight of\nthe fleet. And every bale and huge drum was tallied mentally as it\npassed before his eyes. The ships were being loaded, and with their\nsailing--But, no! He must not let himself think of that!\n\nThroughout the day ships came and departed, and one leviathan, ablaze\nin scarlet color; sailed in to settle down where great steel arms\nenfolded it, not far from the watching men. Scarlet creatures in\nauthority directed operations, and workmen swarmed about the great\nship. Once McGuire swore softly and viciously under his breath, for he\nhad seen a figure that could be only that of Torg, and the crowd\nsaluted with upraised arms as the scarlet figure passed into the\nscarlet ship. This, McGuire knew, was the flagship that should carry\nTorg himself. Torg and ----. He paled at the thought of the other\nname.\n\nThe only break in the long day came with the arrival of a squad of\nguards, who hustled the two men out into a passageway and drove them\nto another room, where certain measurements were taken. The muscular\nfigures of the two were different from these red ones, but it was a\nmoment before McGuire realized the sinister significance of the\nproceedings. Their breadth of shoulders, the thickness of their\nchests--what had these figures to do with their captivity? And then\nthe flyer saw the measures compared with the dimensions of a steel\ncage. Its latticed shape could be endlessly compressed, and within, he\nsaw, were lancet points that lined the ghastly thing throughout. Long\nenough to torture, but not to kill; a thousand delicate blades to\npierce the flesh; and the instrument, it seemed, was of a size that\ncould enclose the writhing, helpless body of a man.\n\nOther unnameable contrivances about the room took on new significance\nwith the knowledge that here was the chamber of horrors whose workings\nhad been seen by Althora in the mind of their captor--horrors of which\nshe could not speak.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMcGuire was sick and giddy as the guards led him roughly back to their\nprison room. And Professor Sykes, too, required no explanation of what\nthey had seen.\n\nThe guards were many, and resistance was useless, but each man looked\nsilently at the other's desperate eyes when the metal cords were\ntwisted again about their wrists, and their hands were tied securely\nto metal rings anchored in the wall beside the window.\n\n\"And there,\" said the flyer, \"goes our last chance of escape. They\nwere not as dumb as we thought: they knew how good a leap to the\npavement would look after we had been in there.\"\n\n\"Less than human!\" Sykes was quoting the comment of Althora's brother.\n\"I think Djorn was quite conservative in his statement.\"\n\nMcGuire examined carefully the cords that tied his hands to the wall\nbeside him. The knots were secure, and the metal ring was smooth and\nround. \"I didn't know,\" he said, as he worked and twisted, \"but there\nmight be a cutting edge, but we haven't a chance. No getting rid of\nthese without a wire cutter or an acetylene torch--and we seem to be\njust out of both.\"\n\nProfessor Sykes tried to adopt the other's nonchalant tone. \"Careless\nof us,\" he began--then stopped breathless to press his body against\nthe wall.\n\n\"It's there!\" he said. \"Oh, my God, if I could only get it, it might\nwork--it might!\"\n\n\"The battery,\" he explained to the man beside him, whose assumed\nindifference vanished at this suggestion of hope; \"--the little\nbattery that I used on the gun, to fire the explosive. It has an\nastounding amperage, and a voltage around three hundred. It's in my\npocket--and I can't reach it!\"\n\n\"You can't keep a good man licked!\" McGuire exulted. \"You mean that\nthe current might melt the wire?\"\n\n\"Soften it, perhaps, depending upon the resistance.\" Sykes refused to\nshare the other's excitement. \"But we can't get at it.\"\n\n\"We've got to,\" was the answer. \"Move over this way.\" The man in khaki\ntwisted his arms awkwardly to permit him to bend his body to one side,\nand beads of sweat stood out on his forehead as the strain forced the\nthin bonds into his wrists. But he brought his agonized face against\nthe other's body, and gripped the fabric of Sykes' coat between his\nteeth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe twisting of his head raised the cloth an inch at a time, and\ndespite Sykes' efforts to hold the garment with his elbow, it slipped\nback time and again. McGuire straightened at intervals to draw a\nchoking breath and ease the strain upon his tortured wrists; then back\nagain in his desperate contortions to worry at the cloth and pull and\nhold--and try again to raise the heavy pocket where a battery made\nsagging folds.\n\nHe was faint and gasping when finally the cloth was brought where the\nscientist's straining fingers could grasp it to writhe and twist in\nclumsy efforts that would force the battery's terminals within reach.\n\n\"I'll try it on mine,\" said Sykes. \"It may be hot--and you've had your\nshare.\" He was holding the flat black thing to bring the copper tips\nagainst the metal about his wrists. McGuire saw the man's lips go\nwhite as a wisp of smoke brought to his nostrils the sickening odor of\nburned flesh.\n\nThe metal glowed, and the man was writhing in silent self-torture when\nat last he threw his weight upon the strands and fell backward to the\nfloor. He lay for a moment, trembling and quivering--but free. And the\nknowledge of that freedom and of the greater torture they would both\nescape, gave him strength to rise and work with crippled hands at his\ncompanion's bonds, till McGuire, too, was free--free to forget his own\nswollen, bleeding wrists in compassionate regard for the other.\n\nLike an injured animal, Professor Sykes had licked with his tongue at\nhis wrists, where hot wire had burned deep and white, and he was\ntrying for forgetfulness an hour later, in examination of the door to\ntheir room.\n\n\"What is the idea?\" McGuire inquired, when he turned from his\nceaseless contemplation of the fleet. \"Not trying to get out, are\nyou?\"\n\n\"I am trying to stay in,\" said Sykes, and looked again at the object\nthat interested him. \"These long bolts,\" he explained: \"top and\nbottom; operated from outside, but exposed in here. They come together\nwhen unlocked; five inches apart now. If I had something to hold them\napart--\n\n\"You haven't a piece of steel about five inches long, have you?--or\nanything to substitute for it? If you have, I can lock this door so\nthe devils won't come in and surprise us before we can make the jump.\"\n\n\"The battery?\" suggested McGuire.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSykes shook his head. \"I tried it. Too long, and besides it would\ncrumble. They operate these with a lever; I saw it outside.\" He went\non silently with his study of the door and the little gap between\nheavy bolts, which, if closed, would mean security from invasion.\n\n\"They're about through,\" McGuire spoke from his post at the window\nafter some time. \"The rush seems to be about over. I imagine they'll\npull out in the morning.\"\n\nHe pointed as Sykes stood beside him. \"Those big ones over beyond have\nnot been touched all day; only some of the crew, I judge, working\naround them. And way over you see forty or fifty whaling big ones:\nthey must have been ready before we came. They have finished on these\nnearer by. It looks like a big day for the brutes.\"\n\nAnd Professor Sykes led him on to talk more of the preparations he had\nseen, and his deductions as to the morrow. It was all too evident what\nwas really on the lieutenant's mind. It was not the thought of their\nown immediate death, but the terrible dread and horror of Althora's\nfate, that hammered and hammered in his brain. To speak of anything\nelse meant a moment's relief.\n\nSykes pointed to a tall mast that was set in the plaza pavement, some\nhundred feet away. Wires swung from it to several points, one of them\nending above their window and entering the building. \"What is that?\"\nhe asked, \"--some radio device? That ball of metal on the top might be\nan aerial.\" But McGuire had fallen silent again, and stared stonily at\nthe deadly fighting ships he was powerless to combat.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the morning that followed, there was no uncertainty. This was the\nday! And from a balconied window up high in the side of a tall stone\nbuilding, two men stood wordless and waiting while they watched the\npreparations below.\n\nThe open space was a sea of motion like flowing blood, where thousands\nof figures in dull red marched in rank after rank to be swallowed in\nthe mammoth ships that McGuire had noted in the distance. Then other\ncolors, and swarms of what they took to be women-folk of this wild\nrace--a medley of color that flowed on and on as if it would never\ncease, to fill one after another of the great ships.\n\n\"Transports, that's what they are,\" said McGuire. \"I can see now why\nthey have no steel beaks like the others. They don't need any rams,\nnor ports for firing that beastly gas. They are gray, too, while the\nfighting ships are striped with red, all except the scarlet one of\nTorg's. Those are colonists we are watching, and soldiers to conquer\nthe Earth where the damned swarm settles.\"\n\nHe stopped to stare at a body of red-clad soldiers, drawn up at\nattention. They made a lane, and their arms were raised in the salute\nthat seemed only for Torg. They stood rigid and motionless; then, from\nbelow the watching men, came one in the full splendor of his scarlet\nregalia. The air echoed with the din of his shouted name, but the\nbedlam of noise fell on deaf ears for McGuire. He could hear nothing,\nand in all the vast kaleidoscope of color he could see only one\nobject--the white face of a girl who was half led and half carried by\na guard of the red ones, where their Emperor led the way.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a strangled cry that was torn from the flyer's throat--the name\nof this girl who was going to the doom she had failed to avoid. Her\nlife, she had said, was hers to keep only if she willed, but her plans\nhad failed, and she went faltering and stumbling after a scarlet man\nbeast.\n\n\"Althora!\" called the flyer, and the figure of the girl was struggling\nwith her guards in a frenzy that tore their hands free. She turned to\nlook toward the sound of the voice, and her face was like that of one\ndead as her eyes found the man she loved.\n\n\"Tommy,\" she called: \"oh, Tommy, my dear! Good-by!\" The words were\nended by the clutch of the scarlet Emperor who turned to seize her.\n\nA clatter came from the door behind them, but Lieutenant McGuire gave\nno heed. Only Professor Sykes sprang back from the balcony to seize\nand struggle with the moving bolts.\n\nThe man on the balcony was hardly less than a maniac as he glared\nwildly about, but he was not too unreasoning to see the folly of a\nwild leap into the throng below. He could never reach her--never. And\nthen his eyes fell upon the wire that led from above him to the great\npole in the open plaza. There was shouting from behind where the\nexecutioners were wrestling with the bolts.\n\n\"Hold them,\" the flyer shouted, \"just for a minute! For God's sake,\nSykes, keep them back! There's a chance!\"\n\nHe sprang to the balustrade of the balcony, but he saw as he leaped\nwhere Professor Sykes had raised his leg to force the thickness of his\nknee between the bolts whose levers outside were bringing them closer\ntogether.\n\n\"Go to it,\" was the answer. \"I can hold them\"--a stifled groan--\"for\na--minute!\" Professor Sykes had found his substitute for five inches\nof steel, and the living flesh yielded but slowly to the pressure of\nthe bolts.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMcGuire was working frantically at the wire, then held himself in\ncheck while he carefully unwound it from its fastening. There was a\nsplice, and he worked with bleeding fingers to unfasten the tight\ncoils. And then the end was free and in his hands. He dropped to the\nbalcony to pull in the slack, and he wrapped the end about beneath his\narms and twisted it tight, then leaped out into space. No thought of\nhimself nor of Sykes in this one wild moment, only of Althora in the\ngrip of those beastly hands.\n\nHe was struggling to turn himself in the air as the colored masses of\npeople seemed sweeping toward him, and he shot as a living pendulum,\nfeet first, into the waiting heads.\n\nHe was on his feet in an instant and tearing at the twisted wire that\nheld him. About him was clamor and confusion, but beyond the nearer\nfigures he saw the one who waited, and beside her a thing in scarlet\nthat shrieked orders to his men.\n\nHe flung off one who leaped toward him, and ducked another to dash\nthrough and reach his man. And he neither saw nor felt the creature's\nripping talons as he drove a succession of rights and lefts to the\nblood-red face.\n\nThe scarlet one went backward under the fusillade of blows; he was\ndown, a huddle of color upon the pavement, and a horde of paralyzed\nsoldiers had recovered from their stupefaction and were rushing upon\nthe flyer. He turned to meet them, but their rush ended as quickly as\nit began: only a step or two they came, then stopped, to add their\nwild voices to the confusion of ear-splitting shrieks that rose from\nall sides.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMcGuire crouched rigid, tense and waiting, nor did he sense for an\ninstant that the assault was checked and that the faces of all about\nhim were turned to the sky. It was the voice of Althora that aroused\nhim:\n\n\"Tommy! Tommy!\" she was calling, and now she was at his side, her\narms about him. \"What is it, Tommy? Look! Look!\" And she too was\ngazing aloft. And then, above all other sounds McGuire heard the\nroar--\n\nThe clouds were golden above with the brilliance of midday--and\nagainst them, hard and sharp of outline, was a shining shape. A cloud\nof vapor streamed behind it as it shot down from the clouds, and the\nthunder of its coming was like the roar of many cannon.\n\nA ship of the red ones was in the air--a fighting ship, whose stripes\nshowed red--and it drove at the roaring menace with its steel beak and\na swirling cloud of gas. It seemed that they must crash, when to\nMcGuire's eyes came the stabbing flash of heavy guns from the shining\nshape. A crashing explosion came down to them as the great beak parted\nand fell, and the body of the red-striped monster opened in bursting\nsmoke and flame, tore slowly into fragments and fell swiftly to the\nearth.\n\nIt struck with a shattering crash some distance away, but one pair of\neyes failed to follow it in its fall. For in the clear air above, with\nthe golden light of distant clouds upon it, a roaring monster of\nsilvery sheen had rolled and swept upward to the heights. And it\nshowed, as it turned, a painted emblem on its bow, a design of\nclear-cut color, unbelievably familiar--a circle of blue, and within\nit a white star and a bull's eye of red--the mark of the flying\nservice of the United States!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMcGuire never knew how he got Althora and himself back to the building\nwhence he had come. Nor did he see the struggling figures on a\nbalcony, or the leap and fall of a maimed body, where Professor Sykes,\nwhen the door had yielded, found surcease and oblivion on the pavement\nbelow.\n\nHe was to learn that later, but now he had eyes only for a sight that\ncould be but a dream, an unreal vision of a disordered brain. He held\nthe slim form of Althora to him in a crushing grip, while he stared,\ndry-eyed, above, and his own voice seemed to shout from afar off:\n\"They're ours!\" that voice was screaming in a frenzy of exultation.\n\"They're our ships! They've come across!\"\n\nThe fighting fleet of the red man-things of Venus was taking to the\nair! The ships rose in a swarm of speeding, darting shapes, and the\ngreat one of Torg was in the lead, climbing in fury toward the\nheights.\n\nFar above them the clouds of gold silhouetted a strange sight, and the\nair was shaking with the thunder from on high, where, straight and\ntrue, a line of silver ships in the sharp V of battle formation drove\ndownward in a deadly, swift descent.\n\nAnd even afar off, the straining eyes of a half-crazed man could see\nthe markings on their bow--a circle and a star--and the colors of his\nown lost fighters of the air.\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nThe Earth-fleet was a slanting line of swiftness that swept downward\nfrom the clouds. A swarm of craft was rising from below. The\nred-striped fighters met the attack first with a cloud of gas.\n\nThe scarlet monster--the flagship of Torg, the Emperor--was in the\nlead, and they shot with terrific speed across the bows of the\noncoming fleet to leave a whirlwind of deadly vapor as they passed.\nMcGuire held his breath in an agony of fear as the cloud enveloped the\nline of ships, but their bow guns roared staccato crashes in the\nthunder of their exhausts as they entered the cloud. And they were\nfiring from the stern as they emerged, while two falling cylinders of\nred and white proved the effectiveness of their fire.\n\nThe formation held true as it swept upward and back where the swarming\nenemy was waiting. They were outnumbered three to one, McGuire saw,\nand his heart sang within him as he watched the sharp, speeding V that\nclimbed upward to the enemy's level then swung to throw itself like a\nlance of light at the massed ships that awaited the attack.\n\nAnother cloud of gas!--and a shattered ship!--and again the line\nemerged to correct its broken formation and drive once more toward the\ncircling swarm.\n\nThey came to meet them now, the clusters of red-striped fighting\nships, and they tore in from all sides upon the American line, their\nhooked beaks gleaming in the sun.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd now, at an unseen signal, the formation broke. Each ship fought\nfor its life, and the stabbing flashes of their guns made ceaseless\njets of light against the smoke and gas clouds that were darkening the\nsky.\n\n\"A dog-fight!\" breathed Lieutenant McGuire; \"and what a dog-fight!\"\nHis words were lost in the terrific thunder from above: the roar of\nthe ships and the dull thuds of the guns engulfed them in a maelstrom\nof noise that battered like physical blows on the watchers below. He\nswore unconsciously and called down curses upon the enemy as he saw\ntwo fighters meet while the shining beak of a ship of the reds crashed\nthrough the body of an opposing craft.\n\nThe red ship dipped at the bow; it backed off with terrific force; and\nfrom the curved beak a ship with the insignia of the red, white and\nblue slid downward in a swift fall to the death that waited.\n\nThey had fought themselves clear, and the Americans, by what must have\nbeen arrangement or wireless order, went roaring to the heights. There\nwere some who followed, but the guns of the speeding ships drove them\noff. Red-and-white shapes fell swiftly from the clouds where the\nfighting had been, and McGuire knew that his fellows had given an\naccount of themselves in the fighting at close range.\n\nAgain the thundering line was sharp and true, and another unswerving\nattack was launching itself from above. And again the deadly\nformation, with ever-increasing speed, drove into the enemy with\nflashing guns, then parted to close with the ones that drove\ncrushingly upon them, while the sharper clatter of rapid-firing guns\ncame to shatter the air.\n\nThe fighting craft had been rising from their level field in a\nsuccession that seemed endless. They were all in the air now, and only\nthe great transports remained on the paved field.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA red-striped fighter swept downward in retreat, and, from the smoke\nclouds, a silvery shape followed in pursuit. It reached the red and\nwhite one with its shells, and the great mass crashed with terrific\nimpact on the field. Its pursuer must have seen the monsters still on\nthe ground, and it swung to rake them with a shower of small-caliber\nshells.\n\nThere were machine-guns rattling as it passed above the thronged\nreds--the troops who were huddled in terror in the open court. It tore\non past them--past a figure in khaki who raced forward with the golden\nform of a girl within his arms, then released her to wave frantically\nas the silver ship shot by.\n\nUnobserved, McGuire and Althora had been, where they stood beside the\nbuildings: the eyes of their enemies, like their own, were on the\nmonstrous battle above. But now they had called themselves to the\nattention of the reds, and there were some who rushed upon them with\nfaces livid with rage.\n\nMcGuire reached for a weapon from a victim of the machine-gun fire and\nprepared to defend himself, but the weapon was never used. He saw the\nsilvery shape reverse itself in the air; it turned sharply to throw\nitself back toward the solitary figure in uniform of their service and\nthe golden-clad girl beside him.\n\nThe flyer raised his weapon, but the jostling swarm that rushed upon\nhim melted: the ripping fire of machine guns was deafening in his\nears. Their deadly tattoo continued while the great ship sank slowly\nto touch and rest its huge bulk upon the pavement. A door in the\nship's curved side opened that the blocky figure of a man might leap\nforth.\n\nHe was grimy of face, and his uniform was streaked with the smoke and\nsweat of battle, but the face beneath the grime, and the hands that\nreached to embrace and pound the flyer upon the back, could be only\nthose of one he had known as his captain--Captain Blake.\n\n\"You son-of-a-gun!\" the shouting figure was repeating. \"You damned\nIrish son-of-a-gun! A. W. O. L.--but you can't get away with it! Come\non--get in here! I'm needed up above!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMcGuire was struggling to speak from a throat that was suddenly tight\nand voiceless. Then--\n\n\"Althora,\" he gasped; \"take Althora!\" and he motioned toward the girl.\nAnd then he remembered the companion he had left in the room above.\nThe battle that had flashed so suddenly had blasted from his mind all\nother thoughts.\n\n\"My God!\" he said. \"--Sykes! I--must get Sykes!\"\n\nHe turned to run back to the building, only to stop in consternation\nwhere a huddle of clothing lay beneath the balcony of their prison\nroom.\n\nIt was Sykes--Sykes who had sacrificed himself to make possible the\nescape of his friend--and McGuire dropped to his knees to touch the\nbody that he knew was shattered beyond any hope of life. He raised the\nlimp burden in his arms and staggered back where more khaki-clad\nfigures had gathered. Two came quickly out to meet him, and he let\nthem take the body of his friend.\n\n\"_C'est fini!_\"--he repeated the words that Sykes had said; \"the end\nof our little journey!\" The arms of Althora were about him as Blake\nhurried them into the waiting ship, and the roar of enormous power\nmarked the rising of this space ship to throw itself again into the\nfray.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA small room with a dome of shatter-proof glass; a pilot who sat there\nto look in all directions, a control-board beneath his hands. Beside\nhim on his elevated station was room for Captain Blake, and McGuire\nand Althora, too. The ship was climbing swiftly. McGuire saw where\nflashing shapes circled and roared in a swelling cloud of smoke and\ngas.\n\nBlake spoke sharply to an aide: \"General orders! All ships climb to\nresume formation!\"\n\nAn enemy ship was before them: it flashed from nowhere to bear down\nwith terrific speed. The floor beneath them shook with the jarring of\nheavy guns, and McGuire saw the advancing shape bursting with puffs of\nsmoke, while their own ship shot upward with a sickening twist. A\nsilver ship was falling!--and another!\n\n\"Two more of ours gone,\" said Captain Blake through set teeth. \"How\nmany of them are there, Mac? Tell me what you know: we've got a hell\nof a fight on our hands.\"\n\n\"They're all here,\" McGuire told him, in jerky, breathless speech.\n\"These are transports on the ground. Their weapons are gas and speed,\nand the rams on their beaked ships. There are other weapons--deadlier\nones!--but they haven't got them: they belong to another race. I'll\ntell you all that later!\"\n\n\"Keep them at a distance, Blake,\" he said. \"Make them come to\nyou--then nail them as they come.\"\n\n\"Right!\" was the answer; \"that's good dope. We didn't know what they\nhad; expected some devilish things that could down us before we got\nwithin effective range; had to mix it with them to find out what they\ncould do, and get in a few solid cracks before they did it.\n\n\"How high are we?\" He glanced quickly at an instrument. \"Ten thousand.\nOrder all ships to withdraw,\" he instructed his aide. \"Rendezvous at\nfifty thousand feet for echelon formation.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnother brush with an enemy craft that slipped quickly to one\nside--then the smoke clouds were behind them, and a score, of silvery\nshapes were climbing in vertical flight for the level at fifty\nthousand.\n\nThey were fewer now than they had been, and the line that formed\nbehind the flagship of Blake was shorter than the one that had made\nthe V which shot down so bravely to engage with an unknown foe.\n\nThe enemy was below; an arrangement of mirrors showed this from the\ncommander's station. They were emerging from the clouds of smoke to\nswarm in circling flight through the sky. And now the bow of their own\ncraft was depressed at an order from Blake, and the others were behind\nthem as they drove to renew the attack.\n\n\"They're ganging up on us again,\" said Blake. \"We'll fool them this\ntime; we'll just kid them a little.\"\n\nThe flagship swerved before reaching the enemy, and the others\nfollowed in what looked like frightened retreat. Again they were in\nthe heights, and some few of the enemy were following. Blake led in\nanother descent.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNo waiting swarm to greet them now! Blake gave a quick order. The\nroaring column shifted position as it fell: the flagship was the apex\nof a great V whose arms flung out and backward on either side--a V\nformation that curved and twisted through space and thundered upon the\nsmaller formations that scattered before the blasting guns.\n\n\"Our bow guns are the effective weapons,\" Blake observed; his casual\ntone was a sedative to McGuire's tense nerves. \"We can use a broadside\nonly of lighter weight; the kick of the big 'sights' has to be taken\nstraight back. But we're working, back home, on recoil-absorbing guns:\nwe'll make fighting ships of these things yet.\"\n\nHe spoke quietly to the pilot to direct their course toward a group\nthat came sweeping upon them, and the massed fire of the squadron was\nsquarely into the oncoming beaks that fell beneath them where the\nmirrors showed them crashing to the earth.\n\nThey were scattered now; the enemy was in wild disorder; and Blake\nspoke sharply to his aide.\n\n\"Break formation,\" he ordered; \"every ship for itself. Engage the\nenemy where they find them; shoot down anything they see; prevent the\nenemy reforming!\" He was taking quick advantage of the other's\nscattered forces, and he scattered his own that he knew could take\ncare of themselves while they engaged the enemy only by ones or twos\nor threes.\n\n\"Clear the air of them!\" he ordered. \"Not one of them must escape!\"\n\nThe skies were a maze of darting shapes that crossed and recrossed to\nmake a spider's web of light. Ship drove at ship, to swerve off at the\nlast, while the air quivered and beat upon them with the explosion of\nshells and guns.\n\n\"There's our meat!\" Blake directed the pilot, and pointed ahead where\na monster in scarlet was swelling into view.\n\nIt came swiftly upon them, darting down from above, and McGuire\nclutched at the arm of the man beside him to shout: \"It's the leader;\nthe flagship! It's the Emperor--Torg, himself! Give him hell, Blake,\nbut look out--he's fast!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe ship was upon them like a flash of fire; no time for anything but\ndodging, and the pilot threw his craft wildly aside with a swerve that\nsent the men sprawling against a stanchion. Then up and back, where\nthe other had turned to come up from below.\n\n\"Fast!\" McGuire had said, but the word was inadequate to describe the\nspeed of the fiery shape.\n\nAnother leap in the air, as their pilot swung his controls, and the\nred shape brushed past them in a cloud of gas, while the quick-firers\nripped futilely into space where the great ship had been.\n\n\"Get your bow guns on him!\" Blake roared. The ship beneath them\nstrained and shuddered with the incredible thunder of the generator\nthat threw them bodily in the air. The pilot had opened in full force\nthe ports that blasted their bows aside.\n\nNo time to gather new speed; they were motionless as the scarlet\nmonster came upon them, but they were in position to receive him. The\neight-inch rifles of the forward turret thundered again and again, to\nbe answered by flashes of flame from the scarlet ship.\n\nMcGuire crouched over the bent form of the pilot, whose steady fingers\nheld the ship's bow straight upon the flashing death that bore down\nupon them. Another salvo!--and another!--hits all of them.... Smoke\nbursting from ripping plates, and flaming fire more vivid than the\nscarlet shape itself!--and the floor beneath McGuire's feet drove\ncrushingly upward as their pilot pulled a lever to the full.\n\nThe great beak flashed beneath--and the mirrors, where McGuire's eyes\nwere fastened, showed the terrific drive continue down and down, where\na brilliant cylinder that marked the power of Venus tore shriekingly\non to carry an Emperor to his crashing death.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe skies were clear of the red-striped ships: only the survivors of\nthe attacking force showed their silvery shapes as they gathered near\ntheir flagship. There were two that pursued a small group of the\nenemy, but they were being outdistanced in the race.\n\n\"We have won,\" said Blake in a tone of wonder that showed how only now\nhad come a realization of what the victory meant. \"We have won, and\nthe earth--is saved!\"\n\nAnd the voice of McGuire echoed his fervent \"Thank God!\" while he\ngripped the soft hand that clung tightly to his, as if Althora, this\nradiant creature of Venus, were timid and abashed among the joyful,\nshouting men-folk from another world.\n\n\"And now what, Captain?\" asked McGuire of his command. \"Will you land?\nThere is an army of reds down there asking for punishment.\"\n\nBlake had turned away; his hand made grimy smears across his face\nwhere he wiped away the tears that marked a brave man's utter\nthankfulness. He covered his emotion with an affectation of\ndisapproval as he swung back toward McGuire.\n\n\"Captain?\" he inquired. \"Captain? Where do you get that captain\nstuff?\"\n\nHe pointed to an emblem on his uniform, a design that was unfamiliar\nto the eyes of McGuire.\n\n\"You're talking to an admiral now!--the first admiral of the newest\nbranch of your country's fighting service--commanding the first fleet\nof the Space ships of the United States of America!\" He threw one arm\nabout the other's shoulders. \"We'll have to get busy, Mac,\" he added,\n\"and think up a new rank for you.\n\n\"And, yes, we are going to land,\" he continued in his customary tones;\n\"there may be survivors of our own crashes. But we'll have to count on\nyou, Mac, to show us around this little new world of yours.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was an army waiting, as McGuire had warned, but it was waiting\nto give punishment and not to take it. The vast expanse of the landing\nfield was swarming with them, and the open country beyond showed\ncolumns of marching troops.\n\nThey had learned, too, to take shelter; barricades had been hastily\nerected, and the men had shields to protect them from the fire of\nsmall arms.\n\nTheir bodies were enclosed in their gas-tight uniforms whose ugly\nhead-pieces served only to conceal the greater ugliness beneath. They\nmet the ships as they landed with a showering rain of gas that was\nfired from huge projectors.\n\n\"Not so good!\" Blake was speaking in the safety of his ship. \"We have\nmasks, but great heavens, Mac!--there must be a million of those\nbrutes. We can spray them with machine-gun fire, but we haven't\nammunition enough to make a dent in them. And we've got to get out and\nget to our crashed ships.\"\n\nHe waited for McGuire's suggestions, but it was Althora who replied.\n\n\"Wait!\" she said imperatively. She seemed to be listening to some\ndistant word. Then:\n\n\"Djorn is coming,\" she exclaimed, and her eyes were brilliantly\nalight. \"He says to you\"--she pointed to McGuire--\"that you were\nright, that we must fight like hell sometimes to deserve our\nheaven--oh, I told him what you said--and now he is coming with all\nhis men!\"\n\n\"What the devil?\" asked Blake in amazement. \"How does she know?\"\n\n\"Telepathy,\" McGuire explained: \"she is talking with her brother, the\nleader of the real inhabitants of Venus.\"\n\nHe told the wondering man briefly of his experience and of the people\nthemselves, the real owners of this world.\n\n\"But what can they do?\" Blake demanded.\n\nAnd McGuire assured him: \"Plenty!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe turned to Althora to ask, \"How are they coming? How will they get\nhere?\"\n\n\"They are marching underground; they have been coming for two days.\nThey knew of our being captured, but the people have been slow in\ndeciding to fight. Djorn dared not tell me of their coming; he feared\nhe might be too late.\n\n\"They will come out of that building,\" she said, and indicated the\ntowering structure that had been their prison. \"It has the old\nconnection with the underground world.\"\n\n\"Well, they'd better be good!\" said Blake incredulously.\n\nHe was still less optimistic when the building before them showed the\ncoming of a file of men. They poured forth, in orderly fashion and\nranged themselves in single file along the walls.\n\nThere must be a thousand, McGuire estimated, and he wondered if the\nwomen, too, were fighting for their own. Then, remembering Althora's\nbrave insistence, he knew his surmise was correct.\n\nEach one was masked against the gas; their faces were concealed; and\neach one held before him a tube of shining metal with a larger bulbous\nend that rested in their hands.\n\n\"Electronic projectors,\" the lieutenant whispered. \"Keep your eye on\nthe enemy, Blake; you are going to learn something about war.\"\n\nThe thin line was advancing now and the gas billowed about them as\nthey came. There were some few who dropped, where masks were\ndefective, but the line came on, and the slim tubes were before them\nin glittering menace.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt a distance of a hundred feet from the first of the entrenched enemy\nthere was a movement along the line, as if the holders of the tubes\nhad each set a mechanism in operation. And before the eyes of the\nEarth-men was a spectacle of horror like nothing in wars they had\nknown.\n\nThe barricades were instantly a roaring furnace; the figures that\nleaped from behind them only added to the flames. From the steady rank\nof the attackers poured an invisible something before which the hosts\nof the enemy fell in huddles of flame. Those nearest were blasted from\nsight in a holocaust of horror, and where they had been was a\nscattering of embers that smoked and glowed; even the figures of\ndistant ones stumbled and fell.\n\nThe myriad fighters of the army of the red ones, when the attackers\nshut off their invisible rays, was a screaming mob that raced wildly\nover the open lands beyond.\n\nAlthora's hands were covering her eyes, but McGuire and Blake, and the\ncrowding men about them, stared in awe and utter astonishment at the\ndevastation that was sweeping this world. An army annihilated before\ntheir eyes! Scores of thousands, there must be, of the dead!\n\nThe voice of Blake was husky with horror. \"What a choice little bit\nout of hell!\" he exclaimed. \"Mac, did you say they were our friends?\nGod help us if they're not!\"\n\n\"They are,\" said McGuire grimly. \"Those are Althora's people who had\nforgotten how to fight; they are recapturing something that they lost\nsome centuries ago. But can they ever destroy the rest of that swarm?\nI don't think they have the heart to do it.\"\n\n\"They do not need.\" It was Althora speaking. \"My people are sickened\nwith the slaughter. But the red ones will go back into the earth, and\nwe will seal them in!--it is Djorn who tells me--and the world will be\nours forevermore.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA matter of two short days, crammed to the uttermost with the\nrealization of the astounding turn of events--and McGuire and Althora\nstood with Blake and Djorn, the ruler, undisputed, of the beautiful\nworld of Venus. A fleet of great ships was roaring high in air. One\nonly, the flagship, was waiting where their little group stood.\n\nThe bodies of the fallen had been recovered; they were at rest now in\nthe ships that waited above. McGuire looked about in final wonder at\nthe sparkling city bathed in a flood of gold. A kindly city\nnow--beautiful; the terrors it had held were fading from his mind. He\nturned to Althora.\n\n\"We are going home,\" he said softly, \"you and I.\"\n\n\"Home?\" Althora's voice was vibrant with dismay.\n\n\"We need you here, friend Mack Guire,\" the voice of Djorn broke in, in\nprotest. \"You have something that we lack--a force and vision--something\nwe have lost.\"\n\n\"We will be back,\" the flyer assured him. \"You befriended me: anything\nI can do in return--\" The grip of his hand completed the sentence.\n\n\"But there is a grave to be made on the summit of Mount Lawson,\" he\nadded quietly. \"I think he would have preferred to lie there--at the\nend of his journey--and I must return to the service where I have not\nyet been mustered out.\"\n\n\"But you said--you were going home,\" faltered Althora. \"Will that\nalways be home to you, Tommy?\"\n\n\"Home, my dear,\" he whispered in words that reached her only, \"is just\nwhere you are.\" His arm went about her to draw her toward the waiting\nship. \"There or here--what matter? We will be content.\"\n\nHer eyes were misty as they smiled an answer. Within the ship that was\nlifting them, they turned to watch a city of opal light grow faintly\nluminous in the distance ... an L-shaped continent shrunk to tiny size ...\nand the nebulous vapors of the cloudland that enclosed this world folded\nsoftly about.\n\n\"We will lead,\" the voice of Blake was saying to an aide: \"same\nformation that we used coming over. Give the necessary orders. But,\"\nhe added slowly to himself, \"the line will be shorter; there are fewer\nof us now.\"\n\nAn astronomical officer laid a chart before the commander. \"We are on\nthe course, sir,\" he reported.\n\n\"Full speed,\" Blake gave the order, and the thundering generator\nanswered from the stern. The Space Fleet of America was going home.\n\n\n(_The End_)\n\n\n\n\n_A meeting Place for Readers of_ Astounding Stories\n\n[Illustration: _The Readers' Corner_]\n\n\n_\"Absurd\" to \"Superb\"_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     Unfortunately, I missed the January number of your very\n     excellent magazine, which I consider superior to any of its\n     type. I brought seven copies--February to August--with me on\n     my vacation, and have so far read the first three from cover\n     to cover.\n\n     The February and March numbers were almost above reproach,\n     but the April number contained two stories so surprisingly\n     poor that I can only conjecture the Editor was ill at that\n     time. They were \"The Man who was Dead,\" by Thomas H. Knight\n     and \"Monsters of Moyen,\" by Arthur J. Burks. For Mr. Knight\n     there is no hope. To him I can only say \"Stop trying to\n     write and get a job.\" I am a rapid and omnivorous reader,\n     but never have I read a story so utterly bad as his. He gets\n     the booby prize.\n\n     Arthur J. Burks, although a master artist in comparison to\n     Knight, is pretty poor--terrible, in fact. His style is\n     dull, repetitious, and stilted. His melodrama is exaggerated\n     to the point of nauseating absurdity. His characters are\n     lifeless and unnatural puppets. So much for the faults.\n\n     Among the best Science Fiction stories I have read is \"The\n     Planet of Dread,\" by R. F. Starzl in the August number. I\n     also very much enjoyed the \"Dr. Bird\" stories by Capt. Meek,\n     and indeed all the others, barring the two I criticized in\n     such a helpful, friendly spirit. Leinster and Cummings are\n     old favorites of mine.\n\n     I prefer your present cover but disagree with your attitude\n     towards reprinting the older works of such authors as George\n     Allen England, Serviss and Cummings, which are now\n     unobtainable and would, I believe, be received with pleasure\n     and applause.\n\n     Congratulations--Joseph S. Stull, 291 Barrington St.,\n     Rochester, N. Y.\n\n     P.S. Since I wrote I have read the May and June\n     numbers--both perfect. C. D. Willard is a superb\n     storyteller.\n\n\n_Wrong Numbers Still!_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I agree with the rest of your readers in the good things\n     they say about your magazine in \"The Readers' Corner.\" There\n     is one story, however, \"The Planet of Dread,\" in your August\n     issue, that gives me a rather sickening feeling of disgust.\n     The trouble was in the climax. After the hero has wandered\n     over quite a portion of the planet Inra, he arrives at some\n     mountains where, lo and behold! an unexpected space ship\n     drops from the clouds to an unfrequented ledge of rock and\n     makes a rescue. After this sensational climax comes an\n     equally thrilling anti-climax--the hero is offered three\n     years' salary for his story. To accuse the future world of\n     doing such a thing is an open insult to our posterity. Ten\n     per cent of my high school freshmen took just such an ending\n     to their first themes.\n\n     As that story took up about one-seventh of your space and\n     your magazine cost twenty cents. I figure you owe your\n     readers three cents on that issue. But, due to the fineness\n     of the rest of your stories, I am willing to forget your\n     debt as far as I am concerned.\n\n     I am happy to see that you are beginning to print articles.\n     I read with interest the one about Mechanical Voices for\n     Telephone Numbers in your September issue. But can't\n     something be done about wrong numbers? The article states\n     that a person dialed the number 8561T. Two seconds later the\n     loud-speaker spoke up, clearly, in an almost human voice,\n     8651T. Wrong number! Must this evil be with us always!\n\n     I am NOT in favor of reprints. You are printing stories\n     every month just as good as any of those suggested to you. I\n     have read most of those classic scientific stories referred\n     to. The best stories along this line have not been written\n     yet. Keep your space clear for them. Let us have young blood\n     with new ideas. Let our authors eat. Good stories were never\n     written on an empty stomach.\n\n     I believe yours is the highest type of the few magazines\n     that lay a greater stress on the brains of the hero than on\n     his good looks. But, for the sake of one of your ardent\n     readers, let that hero use his brains to get himself out of\n     whatever he has gotten into. Don't let a space ship swoop\n     down from above to rescue him. That type of story reminds me\n     a lot of the one where Jonah was rescued from the deep by\n     the timely arrival of the friendly whale. By the way,\n     there's a suggestion for a reprint. I will admit that it\n     would be just about as new to me as some of the others that\n     have been suggested in this \"Corner.\"--Richard Lewis, 448\n     Marion St., Knoxville, Iowa.\n\n\n_Not So \"Green\" in Ireland_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I suppose it's not often you get a letter from an Irish\n     \"Paddy,\" but here's one now. Here in Cork we don't get\n     magazines like Astounding Stories regularly, but I got the\n     May issue to-day and could not stop until I had devoured it\n     from cover to cover. \"The Atom Smasher\" is a story which I\n     have been hunting for for years. When I had finished it, I\n     had to sit back and leave out all the breath which I was\n     holding in in a prolonged \"whew!\" If ever I get the luck to\n     find another Astounding Stories I'll burn up the pages\n     looking for the name Victor Rousseau. Next in order I liked\n     \"Brigands of the Moon\" and \"The Jovian Jest.\" Thought the\n     story \"Into the Ocean's Depths\" an awful fairy tale, but\n     otherwise good reading. The painter of the cover design is a\n     real artist and I wish to express my appreciation of his\n     wonderful rendering of a difficult subject.--Fitz-Gerald\n     Grattan, 11 Frankfield Terrace, Summerhill South, Cork,\n     Irish Free State.\n\n\n_Worthy His Evening and Pipe_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have read my first copy of Astounding Stories, the\n     September.\n\n     The first paragraph in the first part of \"A Problem in\n     Communication\" assured me that I had found a book worthy of\n     my evening and pipe.\n\n     Read that paragraph and you will find Dr. Miles Breuer is\n     most brilliant in his philosophy and clever in the\n     application of that philosophy in his masterpiece of the\n     science of communication.--Don L. Schweitzer, 1402 Bancroft\n     St., Omaha, Nebr.\n\n\n_\"Taking a Claw Hold\"_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     Was just reading the September issue of A. S. and find it\n     ranging first among the Science Fiction magazines now\n     printed. I'm certain your \"Jetta of the Lowlands\" is going\n     to be a masterpiece of Ray Cummings. He is my favorite\n     writer.\n\n     I did not like \"Earth, the Marauder.\" It was too much drawn\n     out and very dry. \"Brigands of the Moon\" was excellent.\n\n     I wish you would print my letter, as I'd like any one, male\n     of female, interested in science to write to me. Would you\n     kindly oblige me?\n\n     I'm glad to see girls taking interest in your magazine, as\n     it shown science is taking a claw hold on everyone--Harold\n     BegGell, 29 Stewart St., Washington, N. J.\n\n\n_This and That_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     In the October issue of Astounding Stories, Mr. Woodrow\n     Gelman casts vote No. 1 for reprints. Well, here is vote No.\n     2. I intended to reply to all your arguments against\n     reprint, but Mr. Gelman has done this very satisfactorily,\n     indeed. I only wish to make a few additional comments.\n\n     You say that only one out of a hundred haven't read reprints\n     [?]. Fifty out of a hundred would be more correct. Five\n     years ago there wasn't a single magazine devoted exclusively\n     to Science Fiction. Now there are six of them, more or less.\n     These magazines have converted thousands of readers into\n     Science Fiction fans. These readers ought to be given a\n     chance to read the old masterpieces. Even those who have\n     read them would be glad to reread them.\n\n     With the exception of the reprints you have pretty near\n     carried out all the readers' wishes. You have put in a\n     readers' department, increased Wesso's illustrations, given\n     us many interplanetary stories, and given us the stories of\n     the leading authors of the day. Surely you can give us\n     reprints when the demand for them is so universal. The ones\n     I want are those written by Cummings, Merritt, Rousseau and\n     Serviss, and I am sure that the rest of the readers want\n     them too. If you are still doubtful, the fairest thing to do\n     is to conduct a vote among the readers. I hope that you\n     will pardon me for being so persistent, but I am sure that\n     you are working in the best interests of the readers and\n     that you will accede to a great and growing popular demand.\n\n     Now about the latest issue of Astounding Stories. \"The\n     Invisible Death\" is the best novelette you have printed up\n     to now. With the exception of Ray Cummings, the best author\n     you have is Victor Rousseau. I am glad to see that there is\n     another story by Rousseau scheduled for next month. Murray\n     Leinster is a close third, and I hope to see more of his\n     stories soon. The second part of \"Jetta of the Lowlands\" was\n     better than the first. \"Stolen Brains\" was also excellent.\n     Keep on printing the Dr. Bird stories. I like them very\n     much.\n\n     Although the stories were splendid, the cover illustration\n     was poor. I believe that this is the worst cover that Wesso\n     has ever drawn. The main fault with it is that there is no\n     science in it. It would be more appropriate for one of those\n     detective magazines. \"The Invisible Death\" has many other\n     interesting scenes from which Wesso could have chosen a more\n     fitting subject. However, Wesso is your best artist and you\n     ought to keep him.--Michael Forgaris, 157 Fourth St.,\n     Passale, N. J.\n\n\n_\"Not Spoiled by ... Editor\"_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     There is one advantage that Astounding Stories has over all\n     of the other Science Fiction magazines. It does not\n     overburden one with an exposition of scientific facts. Too\n     often a story is ruined by a lot of dry textbook stuff that\n     turns an exciting story into a lecture.\n\n     In Astounding Stories we can soar away on the wings of\n     imagination, escaping the humdrum everyday world to new and\n     amazing adventures. The hours fly away like the speed of\n     light, and upon finishing the book our only regret is that\n     we have to wait a whole month before another issue takes us\n     aloft again.\n\n     Having unburdened myself thus far, I think it is most\n     fitting to comment upon your latest (October) issue. To my\n     mind, the stories in order of merit are: \"The Invisible\n     Death,\" \"Stolen Brains,\" \"Jetta of the Lowlands,\" \"Prisoners\n     on the Electron,\" and \"An Extra Man.\"\n\n     I certainly am glad to see Ray Cummings writing for your\n     most excellent magazine. He is an A-1 author.\n\n     It does not make a particle of difference to me about the\n     size of the magazine, but I wish you would have smooth edges\n     like those of your Five-Novels Monthly.\n\n     Am glad to see that \"The Readers' Corner\" is enlarged. I\n     always turn to this first, even before reading the stories.\n     This is a most entertaining department, and I'm glad it is\n     not spoiled by any perfunctory remarks from the editor.\n\n     How about publishing Astounding Stories twice a month?--E.\n     Anderson, 1765 Southern Blvd., New York City, New York.\n\n\n_Roses, Daisies and Violets_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     In appreciation of an enjoyable evening of reading--which\n     extended, by the way, into the wee, sma' hours of early\n     morning--I thought to drop you a few lines, speaking of the\n     high regards your magazine. Astounding Stories, has won from\n     me through merit alone. Your October number particularly\n     fitted into my reading mood last night.\n\n     After the daily grind of newspaper work, it might seem odd\n     that relaxation is sought in \"more reading\"--but it has been\n     my experience, and that of many of my co-workers. I find,\n     that the relief from the high tension of our trade comes\n     from the change in the character of what we read, rather\n     than in \"something else,\" such as physical recreation.\n     Fiction relaxes where \"news\" has keyed up.\n\n     And in the Science Fiction of your magazine's stories of\n     super-science, I find the keenest periods of mental\n     enjoyment through the admirable selection of Astounding\n     Stories' mixed adventure, unique travel and prophetic\n     science. In this I am not alone--a number of my\n     acquaintances have reveled likewise in your magazine at my\n     suggestion.\n\n     I have not quite settled in my mind as to whether you have\n     trained your writers to exploit this special field of\n     magazine fiction, which you occupy so successfully, or, in\n     your editorial capacity, have so well selected the stories\n     that bear the hallmarks of this peculiar interest that\n     appeals so strongly to my leisure hours.\n\n     By whichever road your success has been reached is\n     immaterial--Astounding Stories has registered with me in a\n     degree which should be flattering to your editorial\n     supervision, if I represent, as I think I do, that large\n     class of magazine readers who prefer and seek a\n     science-coated outlet from the humdrum of every day living\n     in mental adventure and travel-thrill reading.\n\n     Have I presented clearly why and how much I like your\n     magazine of Astounding Stories!--E. P. Neill, 910 East Ave.,\n     Red Wing, Minn.\n\n\n_\"Much Easier to Turn\"_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     Once more I am impelled to give a roar. The last few issues\n     have been filled with letters from readers who are evidently\n     not satisfied with a \"different\" magazine. If they do not\n     like to read \"our\" magazine then let them quit, but don't\n     let a heckling minority spoil a real treat. My particular\n     growl this time is directed towards Robert Baldwin and\n     others of his ilk, who squawk about the size (i. e. length\n     and width) of the mag and the uneven pages. The size is\n     perfect (and just because the craze for standardization has\n     hit some of the other Science Fiction mags and they have\n     gone ga-ga over being an awkward shape, that is no reason\n     for your going ahead and spoiling this one) and the uneven\n     pages are a relief when reading because it is much easier to\n     turn over a leaf when they are of a slightly different\n     width.\n\n     However, to take some of the sting off, I must say some of\n     the ideas of said Mr. Baldwin are O. K. Enlarge the mag--of\n     course you will, as readers increase and sales go up.\n     Larger, as he says, \"It will be worth the other jitney.\" Put\n     ads in the rear. Have full page illustrations when possible.\n     But another thing he is absolutely wrong on. Please do not\n     adopt the antique method of continuing a story on page\n     umptyump.\n\n     Some of the readers are still yowling for reprints. Well, it\n     is true that some reprints would be very acceptable.\n     However, as most of the really good old-time tales of\n     Science Fiction can be procured in any good sized library,\n     why bother to print them and thus decrease the space\n     allotted to our new authors, some of whom are even better\n     than Wells, Verne, etc., much as I like the old masters.\n\n     By the way, my \"enlarge\" in the second paragraph means in\n     thickness (amount of reading matter), not shape.\n\n     Wesso has always been good, and he seems to be improving,\n     though he and others might be still better if they would\n     carefully read the descriptions of persons and animals of\n     other planets before picturing them. I don't wish to make\n     this blurb too long, so will not be specific, but you and\n     others probably have seen the same as I, where the\n     illustration has not been true to the description.\n\n     It might interest you to know that I have been instrumental\n     in getting several new readers for Astounding Stories. Long\n     live \"our\" new mag.--Robert J Hyatt, 1353 Kenyon St., N. W.,\n     Washington, D. C.\n\n\n_Ow! Ow! Ow!_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have just looked at \"The Reader's Corner\" in the October\n     issue of Astounding Stories. It disgusted me. What you print\n     there--only letters praising your magazine to the skies?--or\n     do you occasionally print a brickbat?\n\n     I've bought your magazine each time since it was first\n     printed. And many times I've felt like quitting. Why? There\n     are a number of reasons.\n\n     First, you print stories that have nothing to do with\n     science, such as \"The Soul Master.\" Second, your\n     illustrations are poor. They would look better if they were\n     full page ones. Wesso is the best artist you have. Gould and\n     Sabo are just plain cartoonists, and mighty poor ones at\n     that. Third, you print stories that give a weak and\n     implausible scientific basis. Diffin, Gee, Leinster and\n     several others err in this respect. Fourth, rotten paper--it\n     goes to pieces after being handled. Fifth, no editorial or\n     science questionnaire.\n\n     Your authors will not starve if you print reprints. Rousseau\n     and a lot of others write for other magazines. And reprints\n     would occupy such a measly space that they could hardly be\n     called down for being printed.\n\n     Your magazine has some good features: a good cover; good\n     authors like Breuer, Vincent, Meek, Ernst and Starzl; clear\n     type; and handy size.\n\n     If anyone thinks I'm wrong--well my address is given. This\n     challenge includes the editor. I sincerely hope you will\n     improve your magazine--Edwin C. Magnuson, 1205 E. Ninth St.,\n     Duluth, Minn.\n\n\n_Suggestions_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have read your excellent magazine ever since it came out,\n     and though it needs a few corrections like the others, A. S.\n     is nearly perfect. Why not have your pages evened up, and\n     add a department of science on subjects such as Rocket\n     Propulsion etc., so the readers could become familiar with\n     the mystifying problems stated in the stories? Have the\n     advertisements in the back, and don't change your artists as\n     their work is satisfactory.\n\n     Robert Baldwin of Illinois has an excellent list of\n     suggestions. Why not have a page devoted to the pictures and\n     biographies of your writers, and full page illustrations?\n     Why not have a space for good reprints and charge a nickel\n     more? I am sure it will be appreciated by readers. Why don't\n     you put out a Quarterly, twice as thick or containing twice\n     as many stories for fifty cents?--A satisfied reader--Hume\n     V. Stephani, 37-1/2 Wood St., Auburn, New York.\n\n\n_\"The Readers' Corner\"_\n\nAll readers are extended a sincere and cordial invitation to \"come\nover in 'The Readers' Corner'\" and join in our monthly discussion of\nstories, authors, scientific principles and possibilities--everything\nthat's of common interest in connection with our Astounding Stories.\n\nAlthough, from time to time the Editor may make a comment or so, this\nis a department primarily for _Readers_, and we want you to make full\nuse of it. Likes, dislikes, criticisms, explanations roses, brickbats,\nsuggestions--everything's welcome here; so \"come over in 'The Readers'\nCorner'\" and discuss it with all of us!\n\n--_The Editor._\n\n\n[Illustration: Advertisement.]\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Astounding Stories, February, 1931, by Various\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ASTOUNDING STORIES, FEBRUARY, 1931 ***\n\n***** This file should be named 30124-8.txt or 30124-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/0/1/2/30124/\n\nProduced by Sankar Viswanathan, Greg Weeks, and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
