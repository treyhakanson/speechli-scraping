INSOMNIA\n\nOne afternoon, at low water, Mr. Isbister, a young artist lodging at\nBoscastle, walked from that place to the picturesque cove of Pentargen,\ndesiring to examine the caves there. Halfway down the precipitous\npath to the Pentargen beach he came suddenly upon a man sitting in an\nattitude of profound distress beneath a projecting mass of rock. The\nhands of this man hung limply over his knees, his eyes were red and\nstaring before him, and his face was wet with tears.\n\nHe glanced round at Isbister's footfall. Both men were disconcerted,\nIsbister the more so, and, to override the awkwardness of his\ninvoluntary pause, he remarked, with an air of mature conviction, that\nthe weather was hot for the time of year.\n\n\"Very,\" answered the stranger shortly, hesitated a second, and added in\na colourless tone, \"I can't sleep.\"\n\nIsbister stopped abruptly. \"No?\" was all he said, but his bearing\nconveyed his helpful impulse.\n\n\"It may sound incredible,\" said the stranger, turning weary eyes to\nIsbister's face and emphasizing his words with a languid hand, \"but I\nhave had no sleep--no sleep at all for six nights.\"\n\n\"Had advice?\"\n\n\"Yes. Bad advice for the most part. Drugs. My nervous system.... They\nare all very well for the run of people. It's hard to explain. I dare\nnot take... sufficiently powerful drugs.\"\n\n\"That makes it difficult,\" said Isbister.\n\nHe stood helplessly in the narrow path, perplexed what to do. Clearly\nthe man wanted to talk. An idea natural enough under the circumstances,\nprompted him to keep the conversation going. \"I've never suffered from\nsleeplessness myself,\" he said in a tone of commonplace gossip, \"but in\nthose cases I have known, people have usually found something--\"\n\n\"I dare make no experiments.\"\n\nHe spoke wearily. He gave a gesture of rejection, and for a space both\nmen were silent.\n\n\"Exercise?\" suggested Isbister diffidently, with a glance from his\ninterlocutor's face of wretchedness to the touring costume he wore.\n\n\"That is what I have tried. Unwisely perhaps. I have followed the coast,\nday after day--from New Quay. It has only added muscular fatigue to\nthe mental. The cause of this unrest was overwork--trouble. There was\nsomething--\"\n\nHe stopped as if from sheer fatigue. He rubbed his forehead with a lean\nhand. He resumed speech like one who talks to himself.\n\n\"I am a lone wolf, a solitary man, wandering through a world in which\nI have no part. I am wifeless--childless--who is it speaks of the\nchildless as the dead twigs on the tree of life? I am wifeless, I\nchildless--I could find no duty to do. No desire even in my heart. One\nthing at last I set myself to do.\n\n\"I said, I will do this, and to do it, to overcome the inertia of this\ndull body, I resorted to drugs. Great God, I've had enough of drugs!\nI don't know if _you_ feel the heavy inconvenience of the body, its\nexasperating demand of time from the mind--time--life! Live! We only\nlive in patches. We have to eat, and then comes the dull digestive\ncomplacencies--or irritations. We have to take the air or else our\nthoughts grow sluggish, stupid, run into gulfs and blind alleys. A\nthousand distractions arise from within and without, and then comes\ndrowsiness and sleep. Men seem to live for sleep. How little of a man's\nday is his own--even at the best! And then come those false friends,\nthose Thug helpers, the alkaloids that stifle natural fatigue and kill\nrest--black coffee, cocaine--\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Isbister.\n\n\"I did my work,\" said the sleepless man with a querulous intonation.\n\n\"And this is the price?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nFor a little while the two remained without speaking.\n\n\"You cannot imagine the craving for rest that I feel--a hunger and\nthirst. For six long days, since my work was done, my mind has been a\nwhirlpool, swift, unprogressive and incessant, a torrent of thoughts\nleading nowhere, spinning round swift and steady--\"\n\nHe paused. \"Towards the gulf.\"\n\n\"You must sleep,\" said Isbister decisively, and with an air of a remedy\ndiscovered. \"Certainly you must sleep.\"\n\n\"My mind is perfectly lucid. It was never clearer. But I know I am\ndrawing towards the vortex. Presently--\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"You have seen things go down an eddy? Out of the light of the day, out\nof this sweet world of sanity--down--\"\n\n\"But,\" expostulated Isbister.\n\nThe man threw out a hand towards him, and his eyes were wild, and his\nvoice suddenly high. \"I shall kill myself. If in no other way--at the\nfoot of yonder dark precipice there, where the waves are green, and the\nwhite surge lifts and falls, and that little thread of water trembles\ndown. There at any rate is ... sleep.\"\n\n\"That's unreasonable,\" said Isbister, startled at the man's hysterical\ngust of emotion. \"Drugs are better than that.\"\n\n\"There at any rate is sleep,\" repeated the stranger, not heeding him.\n\nIsbister looked at him and wondered transitorily if some complex\nProvidence had indeed brought them together that afternoon. \"It's not\na cert, you know,\" he remarked. \"There's a cliff like that at Lulworth\nCove--as high, anyhow--and a little girl fell from top to bottom. And\nlives to-day--sound and well.\"\n\n\"But those rocks there?\"\n\n\"One might lie on them rather dismally through a cold night, broken\nbones grating as one shivered, chill water splashing over you. Eh?\"\n\nTheir eyes met. \"Sorry to upset your ideals,\" said Isbister with a sense\nof devil-may-careish brilliance.\n\n\"But a suicide over that cliff (or any cliff for the matter of that),\nreally, as an artist--\" He laughed. \"It's so damned amateurish.\"\n\n\"But the other thing,\" said the sleepless man irritably, \"the other\nthing. No man can keep sane if night after night--\"\n\n\"Have you been walking along this coast alone?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Silly sort of thing to do. If you'll excuse my saying so. Alone! As\nyou say; body fag is no cure for brain fag. Who told you to? No wonder;\nwalking! And the sun on your head, heat, fag, solitude, all the day\nlong, and then, I suppose, you go to bed and try very hard--eh?\"\n\nIsbister stopped short and looked at the sufferer doubtfully.\n\n\"Look at these rocks!\" cried the seated man with a sudden force of\ngesture. \"Look at that sea that has shone and quivered there for ever!\nSee the white spume rush into darkness under that great cliff. And this\nblue vault, with the blinding sun pouring from the dome of it. It is\nyour world. You accept it, you rejoice in it. It warms and supports and\ndelights you. And for me--\"\n\nHe turned his head and showed a ghastly face, bloodshot pallid eyes and\nbloodless lips. He spoke almost in a whisper. \"It is the garment of my\nmisery. The whole world... is the garment of my misery.\"\n\nIsbister looked at all the wild beauty of the sunlit cliffs about them\nand back to that face of despair. For a moment he was silent.\n\nHe started, and made a gesture of impatient rejection. \"You get a\nnight's sleep,\" he said, \"and you won't see much misery out here. Take\nmy word for it.\"\n\nHe was quite sure now that this was a providential encounter. Only half\nan hour ago he had been feeling horribly bored. Here was employment the\nbare thought of which was righteous self-applause. He took possession\nforthwith. It seemed to him that the first need of this exhausted being\nwas companionship He flung himself down on the steeply sloping turf\nbeside the motionless seated figure, and deployed forthwith into a\nskirmishing line of gossip.\n\nHis hearer seemed to have lapsed into apathy; he stared dismally\nseaward, and spoke only in answer to Isbister's direct questions--and\nnot to all of those. But he made no sign of objection to this benevolent\nintrusion upon his despair.\n\nIn a helpless way he seemed even grateful, and when presently Isbister,\nfeeling that his unsupported talk was losing vigour, suggested that they\nshould reascend the steep and return towards Boscastle, alleging the\nview into Blackapit, he submitted quietly. Halfway up he began talking\nto himself, and abruptly turned a ghastly face on his helper. \"What can\nbe happening?\" he asked with a gaunt illustrative hand. \"What can be\nhappening? Spin, spin, spin, spin. It goes round and round, round and\nround for evermore.\"\n\nHe stood with his hand circling\n\n\"It's all right, old chap,\" said Isbister with the air of an old friend.\n\"Don't worry yourself. Trust to me.\"\n\nThe man dropped his hand and turned again. They went over the brow in\nsingle file and to the headland beyond Penally, with the sleepless man\ngesticulating ever and again, and speaking fragmentary things concerning\nhis whirling brain. At the headland they stood for a space by the seat\nthat looks into the dark mysteries of Blackapit, and then he sat down.\nIsbister had resumed his talk whenever the path had widened sufficiently\nfor them to walk abreast. He was enlarging upon the complex difficulty\nof making Boscastle Harbour in bad weather, when suddenly and quite\nirrelevantly his companion interrupted him again.\n\n\"My head is not like what it was,\" he said, gesticulating for want\nof expressive phrases. \"It's not like what it was. There is a sort of\noppression, a weight. No--not drowsiness, would God it were! It is like\na shadow, a deep shadow falling suddenly and swiftly across something\nbusy. Spin, spin into the darkness. The tumult of thought, the confusion,\nthe eddy and eddy. I can't express it. I can hardly keep my mind on\nit--steadily enough to tell you.\"\n\nHe stopped feebly.\n\n\"Don't trouble, old chap,\" said Isbister. \"I think I can understand. At\nany rate, it don't matter very much just at present about telling me,\nyou know.\"\n\nThe sleepless man thrust his knuckles into his eyes and rubbed them.\nIsbister talked for awhile while this rubbing continued, and then he had\na fresh idea. \"Come down to my room,\" he said, \"and try a pipe. I can\nshow you some sketches of this Blackapit. If you'd care?\"\n\nThe other rose obediently and followed him down the steep.\n\nSeveral times Isbister heard him stumble as they came down, and his\nmovements were slow and hesitating. \"Come in with me,\" said Isbister,\n\"and try some cigarettes and the blessed gift of alcohol. If you take\nalcohol?\"\n\nThe stranger hesitated at the garden gate. He seemed no longer clearly\naware of his actions. \"I don't drink,\" he said slowly, coming up the\ngarden path, and after a moment's interval repeated absently, \"No--I\ndon't drink. It goes round. Spin, it goes--spin--\"\n\nHe stumbled at the doorstep and entered the room with the bearing of one\nwho sees nothing.\n\nThen he sat down abruptly and heavily in the easy chair, seemed almost\nto fall into it. He leant forward with his brows on his hands and became\nmotionless.\n\nPresently he made a faint sound in his throat. Isbister moved about\nthe room with the nervousness of an inexperienced host, making little\nremarks that scarcely required answering. He crossed the room to his\nportfolio, placed it on the table and noticed the mantel clock.\n\n\"I don't know if you'd care to have supper with me,\" he said with an\nunlighted cigarette in his hand--his mind troubled with a design of\nthe furtive administration of chloral. \"Only cold mutton, you know, but\npassing sweet. Welsh. And a tart, I believe.\" He repeated this after\nmomentary silence.\n\nThe seated man made no answer. Isbister stopped, match in hand,\nregarding him.\n\nThe stillness lengthened. The match went out, the cigarette was put down\nunlit. The man was certainly very still. Isbister took up the portfolio,\nopened it, put it down, hesitated, seemed about to speak. \"Perhaps,\" he\nwhispered doubtfully. Presently he glanced at the door and back to\nthe figure. Then he stole on tiptoe out of the room, glancing at his\ncompanion after each elaborate pace.\n\nHe closed the door noiselessly. The house door was standing open, and\nhe went out beyond the porch, and stood where the monkshood rose at\nthe corner of the garden bed. From this point he could see the stranger\nthrough the open window, still and dim, sitting head on hand. He had not\nmoved.\n\nA number of children going along the road stopped and regarded the\nartist curiously. A boatman exchanged civilities with him. He felt\nthat possibly his circumspect attitude and position seemed peculiar and\nunaccountable. Smoking, perhaps, might seem more natural. He drew pipe\nand pouch from his pocket, filled the pipe slowly.\n\n\"I wonder,\"... he said, with a scarcely perceptible loss of complacency.\n\"At any rate we must give him a chance.\" He struck a match in the virile\nway, and proceeded to light his pipe.\n\nPresently he heard his landlady behind him, coming with his lamp lit\nfrom the kitchen. He turned, gesticulating with his pipe, and stopped\nher at the door of his sitting-room. He had some difficulty in\nexplaining the situation in whispers, for she did not know he had a\nvisitor. She retreated again with the lamp, still a little mystified to\njudge from her manner, and he resumed his hovering at the corner of the\nporch, flushed and less at his ease.\n\nLong after he had smoked out his pipe, and when the bats were abroad,\nhis curiosity dominated his complex hesitations, and he stole back into\nhis darkling sitting-room. He paused in the doorway. The stranger\nwas still in the same attitude, dark against the window. Save for the\nsinging of some sailors aboard one of the little slate-carrying ships\nin the harbour, the evening was very still. Outside, the spikes of\nmonkshood and delphinium stood erect and motionless against the shadow\nof the hillside. Something flashed into Isbister's mind; he started, and\nleaning over the table, listened. An unpleasant suspicion grew stronger;\nbecame conviction. Astonishment seized him and became--dread!\n\nNo sound of breathing came from the seated figure!\n\nHe crept slowly and noiselessly round the table, pausing twice to\nlisten. At last he could lay his hand on the back of the armchair. He\nbent down until the two heads were ear to ear.\n\nThen he bent still lower to look up at his visitor's face. He started\nviolently and uttered an exclamation. The eyes were void spaces of\nwhite.\n\nHe looked again and saw that they were open and with the pupils rolled\nunder the lids. He was suddenly afraid. Overcome by the strangeness of\nthe man's condition, he took him by the shoulder and shook him. \"Are you\nasleep?\" he said, with his voice jumping into alto, and again, \"Are you\nasleep?\"\n\nA conviction took possession of his mind that this man was dead. He\nsuddenly became active and noisy, strode across the room, blundering\nagainst the table as he did so, and rang the bell.\n\n\"Please bring a light at once,\" he said in the passage. \"There is\nsomething wrong with my friend.\"\n\nThen he returned to the motionless seated figure, grasped the shoulder,\nshook it, and shouted. The room was flooded with yellow glare as his\nastonished landlady entered with the light. His face was white as he\nturned blinking towards her. \"I must fetch a doctor at once,\" he said.\n\"It is either death or a fit. Is there a doctor in the village? Where is\na doctor to be found?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. THE TRANCE\n\nThe state of cataleptic rigour into which this man had fallen, lasted\nfor an unprecedented length of time, and then he passed slowly to the\nflaccid state, to a lax attitude suggestive of profound repose. Then it\nwas his eyes could be closed.\n\nHe was removed from the hotel to the Boscastle surgery, and from the\nsurgery, after some weeks, to London. But he still resisted every\nattempt at reanimation. After a time, for reasons that will appear\nlater, these attempts were discontinued. For a great space he lay in\nthat strange condition, inert and still neither dead nor living but, as\nit were, suspended, hanging midway between nothingness and existence.\nHis was a darkness unbroken by a ray of thought or sensation, a\ndreamless inanition, a vast space of peace. The tumult of his mind had\nswelled and risen to an abrupt climax of silence. Where was the man?\nWhere is any man when insensibility takes hold of him?\n\n\"It seems only yesterday,\" said Isbister. \"I remember it all as\nthough it happened yesterday--clearer perhaps, than if it had happened\nyesterday.\"\n\nIt was the Isbister of the last chapter, but he was no longer a\nyoung man. The hair that had been brown and a trifle in excess of the\nfashionable length, was iron grey and clipped close, and the face that\nhad been pink and white was buff and ruddy. He had a pointed beard shot\nwith grey. He talked to an elderly man who wore a summer suit of drill\n(the summer of that year was unusually hot). This was Warming, a London\nsolicitor and next of kin to Graham, the man who had fallen into the\ntrance. And the two men stood side by side in a room in a house in\nLondon regarding his recumbent figure.\n\nIt was a yellow figure lying lax upon a water-bed and clad in a flowing\nshirt, a figure with a shrunken face and a stubby beard, lean limbs and\nlank nails, and about it was a case of thin glass. This glass seemed\nto mark off the sleeper from the reality of life about him, he was a\nthing apart, a strange, isolated abnormality. The two men stood close to\nthe glass, peering in.\n\n\"The thing gave me a shock,\" said Isbister \"I feel a queer sort of\nsurprise even now when I think of his white eyes. They were white, you\nknow, rolled up. Coming here again brings it all back to me.\n\n\"Have you never seen him since that time?\" asked Warming.\n\n\"Often wanted to come,\" said Isbister; \"but business nowadays is too\nserious a thing for much holiday keeping. I've been in America most of\nthe time.\"\n\n\"If I remember rightly,\" said Warming, \"you were an artist?\"\n\n\"Was. And then I became a married man. I saw it was all up with black\nand white, very soon--at least for a mediocre man, and I jumped on to\nprocess. Those posters on the Cliffs at Dover are by my people.\"\n\n\"Good posters,\" admitted the solicitor, \"though I was sorry to see them\nthere.\"\n\n\"Last as long as the cliffs, if necessary,\" exclaimed Isbister with\nsatisfaction. \"The world changes. When he fell asleep, twenty years\nago, I was down at Boscastle with a box of water-colours and a noble,\nold-fashioned ambition. I didn't expect that some day my pigments would\nglorify the whole blessed coast of England, from Land's End round again\nto the Lizard. Luck comes to a man very often when he's not looking.\"\n\nWarming seemed to doubt the quality of the luck. \"I just missed seeing\nyou, if I recollect aright.\"\n\n\"You came back by the trap that took me to Camelford railway station.\nIt was close on the Jubilee, Victoria's Jubilee, because I remember the\nseats and flags in Westminster, and the row with the cabman at Chelsea.\"\n\n\"The Diamond Jubilee, it was,\" said Warming; \"the second one.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes! At the proper Jubilee--the Fifty Year affair--I was down at\nWookey--a boy. I missed all that.... What a fuss we had with him! My\nlandlady wouldn't take him in, wouldn't let him stay--he looked so queer\nwhen he was rigid. We had to carry him in a chair up to the hotel. And\nthe Boscastle doctor--it wasn't the present chap, but the G.P. before\nhim--was at him until nearly two, with, me and the landlord holding\nlights and so forth.\"\n\n\"It was a cataleptic rigour at first, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Stiff!--wherever you bent him he stuck. You might have stood him on\nhis head and he'd have stopped. I never saw such stiffness. Of course\nthis\"--he indicated the prostrate figure by a movement of his head--\"is\nquite different. And, of course, the little doctor--what was his name?\"\n\n\"Smithers?\"\n\n\"Smithers it was--was quite wrong in trying to fetch him round too soon,\naccording to all accounts. The things he did. Even now it makes me feel\nall--ugh! Mustard, snuff, pricking. And one of those beastly little\nthings, not dynamos--\"\n\n\"Induction coils.\"\n\n\"Yes. You could see his muscles throb and jump, and he twisted about.\nThere was just two flaring yellow candles, and all the shadows were\nshivering, and the little doctor nervous and putting on side, and\nhim--stark and squirming in the most unnatural ways. Well, it made me\ndream.\"\n\nPause.\n\n\"It's a strange state,\" said Warming.\n\n\"It's a sort of complete absence,\" said Isbister.\n\n\"Here's the body, empty. Not dead a bit, and yet not alive. It's like a\nseat vacant and marked 'engaged.' No feeling, no digestion, no beating\nof the heart--not a flutter. _That_ doesn't make me feel as if there was\na man present. In a sense it's more dead than death, for these doctors\ntell me that even the hair has stopped growing. Now with the proper\ndead, the hair will go on growing--\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Warming, with a flash of pain in his expression.\n\nThey peered through the glass again. Graham was indeed in a strange\nstate, in the flaccid phase of a trance, but a trance unprecedented in\nmedical history. Trances had lasted for as much as a year before--but at\nthe end of that time it had ever been waking or a death; sometimes first\none and then the other. Isbister noted the marks the physicians had\nmade in injecting nourishment, for that device had been resorted to to\npostpone collapse; he pointed them out to Warming, who had been trying\nnot to see them.\n\n\"And while he has been lying here,\" said Isbister, with the zest of a\nlife freely spent, \"I have changed my plans in life; married, raised\na family, my eldest lad--I hadn't begun to think of sons then--is an\nAmerican citizen, and looking forward to leaving Harvard. There's\na touch of grey in my hair. And this man, not a day older nor wiser\n(practically) than I was in my downy days. It's curious to think of.\"\n\nWarming turned. \"And I have grown old too. I played cricket with him\nwhen I was still only a lad. And he looks a young man still. Yellow\nperhaps. But that is a young man nevertheless.\"\n\n\"And there's been the War,\" said Isbister.\n\n\"From beginning to end.\"\n\n\"And these Martians.\"\n\n\"I've understood,\" said Isbister after a pause, \"that he had some\nmoderate property of his own?\"\n\n\"That is so,\" said Warming. He coughed primly. \"As it happens--have\ncharge of it.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Isbister thought, hesitated and spoke: \"No doubt--his keep here is\nnot expensive--no doubt it will have improved--accumulated?\"\n\n\"It has. He will wake up very much better off--if he wakes--than when he\nslept.\"\n\n\"As a business man,\" said Isbister, \"that thought has naturally been in\nmy mind. I have, indeed, sometimes thought that, speaking commercially,\nof course, this sleep may be a very good thing for him. That he knows\nwhat he is about, so to speak, in being insensible so long. If he had\nlived straight on--\"\n\n\"I doubt if he would have premeditated as much,\" said Warming. \"He was\nnot a far-sighted man. In fact--\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"We differed on that point. I stood to him somewhat in the relation of\na guardian. You have probably seen enough of affairs to recognise that\noccasionally a certain friction--. But even if that was the case, there\nis a doubt whether he will ever wake. This sleep exhausts slowly, but\nit exhausts. Apparently he is sliding slowly, very slowly and tediously,\ndown a long slope, if you can understand me?\"\n\n\"It will be a pity to lose his surprise. There's been a lot of change\nthese twenty years. It's Rip Van Winkle come real.\"\n\n\"It's Bellamy,\" said Warming. \"There has been a lot of change certainly.\nAnd, among other changes, I have changed. I am an old man.\"\n\nIsbister hesitated, and then feigned a belated surprise. \"I shouldn't\nhave thought it.\"\n\n\"I was forty-three when his bankers--you remember you wired to his\nbankers--sent on to me.\"\n\n\"I got their address from the cheque book in his pocket,\" said Isbister.\n\n\"Well, the addition is not difficult,\" said Warming.\n\nThere was another pause, and then Isbister gave way to an unavoidable\ncuriosity. \"He may go on for years yet,\" he said, and had a moment of\nhesitation. \"We have to consider that. His affairs, you know, may fall\nsome day into the hands of--someone else, you know.\"\n\n\"That, if you will believe me, Mr. Isbister, is one of the problems most\nconstantly before my mind. We happen to be--as a matter of fact, there\nare no very trustworthy connections of ours. It is a grotesque and\nunprecedented position.\"\n\n\"It is,\" said Isbister. \"As a matter of fact, it's a case for a public\ntrustee, if only we had such a functionary.\"\n\n\"It seems to me it's a case for some public body, some practically\nundying guardian. If he really is going on living--as the doctors, some\nof them, think. As a matter of fact, I have gone to one or two public\nmen about it. But, so far, nothing has been done.\"\n\n\"It wouldn't be a bad idea to hand him over to some public body--the\nBritish Museum Trustees, or the Royal College of Physicians. Sounds a\nbit odd, of course, but the whole situation is odd.\"\n\n\"The difficulty is to induce them to take him.\"\n\n\"Red tape, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Partly.\"\n\nPause. \"It's a curious business, certainly,\" said Isbister. \"And\ncompound interest has a way of mounting up.\"\n\n\"It has,\" said Warming. \"And now the gold supplies are running short\nthere is a tendency towards ... appreciation.\"\n\n\"I've felt that,\" said Isbister with a grimace. \"But it makes it better\nfor him.\"\n\n\"If he wakes.\"\n\n\"If he wakes,\" echoed Isbister. \"Do you notice the pinched-ill look of\nhis nose, and the way in which his eyelids sink?\"\n\nWarming looked and thought for a space. \"I doubt if he will wake,\" he\nsaid at last.\n\n\"I never properly understood,\" said Isbister, \"what it was brought this\non. He told me something about overstudy. I've often been curious.\"\n\n\"He was a man of considerable gifts, but spasmodic, emotional. He had\ngrave domestic troubles, divorced his wife, in fact, and it was as a\nrelief from that, I think, that he took up politics of the rabid sort.\nHe was a fanatical Radical--a Socialist--or typical Liberal,\nas they used to call themselves, of the advanced school.\nEnergetic--flighty--undisciplined. Overwork upon a controversy did this\nfor him. I remember the pamphlet he wrote--a curious production. Wild,\nwhirling stuff. There were one or two prophecies. Some of them are\nalready exploded, some of them are established facts. But for the\nmost part to read such a thesis is to realise how full the world is of\nunanticipated things. He will have much to learn, much to unlearn, when\nhe wakes. If ever a waking comes.\"\n\n\"I'd give anything to be there,\" said Isbister, \"just to hear what he\nwould say to it all.\"\n\n\"So would I,\" said Warming. \"Aye! so would I,\" with an old man's sudden\nturn to self pity. \"But I shall never see him wake.\"\n\nHe stood looking thoughtfully at the waxen figure. \"He will never wake,\"\nhe said at last. He sighed \"He will never wake again.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. THE AWAKENING\n\nBut Warming was wrong in that. An awakening came.\n\nWhat a wonderfully complex thing! this simple seeming unity--the self!\nWho can trace its reintegration as morning after morning we awaken, the\nflux and confluence of its countless factors interweaving, rebuilding,\nthe dim first stirrings of the soul, the growth and synthesis of\nthe unconscious to the subconscious, the sub-conscious to dawning\nconsciousness, until at last we recognise ourselves again. And as it\nhappens to most of us after the night's sleep, so it was with Graham at\nthe end of his vast slumber. A dim cloud of sensation taking shape, a\ncloudy dreariness, and he found himself vaguely somewhere, recumbent,\nfaint, but alive.\n\nThe pilgrimage towards a personal being seemed to traverse vast gulfs,\nto occupy epochs. Gigantic dreams that were terrible realities at the\ntime, left vague perplexing memories, strange creatures, strange\nscenery, as if from another planet. There was a distinct impression,\ntoo, of a momentous conversation, of a name--he could not tell what\nname--that was subsequently to recur, of some queer long-forgotten\nsensation of vein and muscle, of a feeling of vast hopeless effort, the\neffort of a man near drowning in darkness. Then came a panorama of\ndazzling unstable confluent scenes.\n\nGraham became aware his eyes were open and regarding some unfamiliar\nthing.\n\nIt was something white, the edge of something, a frame of wood. He\nmoved his head slightly, following the contour of this shape. It went up\nbeyond the top of his eyes. He tried to think where he might be. Did it\nmatter, seeing he was so wretched? The colour of his thoughts was a dark\ndepression. He felt the featureless misery of one who wakes towards\nthe hour of dawn. He had an uncertain sense of whispers and footsteps\nhastily receding.\n\nThe movement of his head involved a perception of extreme physical\nweakness. He supposed he was in bed in the hotel at the place in the\nvalley--but he could not recall that white edge. He must have slept. He\nremembered now that he had wanted to sleep. He recalled the cliff and\nwaterfall again, and then recollected something about talking to a\npasser-by.\n\nHow long had he slept? What was that sound of pattering feet? And that\nrise and fall, like the murmur of breakers on pebbles? He put out a\nlanguid hand to reach his watch from the chair whereon it was his habit\nto place it, and touched some smooth hard surface like glass. This was\nso unexpected that it startled him extremely. Quite suddenly he rolled\nover, stared for a moment, and struggled into a sitting position. The\neffort was unexpectedly difficult, and it left him giddy and weak--and\namazed.\n\nHe rubbed his eyes. The riddle of his surroundings was confusing but his\nmind was quite clear--evidently his sleep had benefited him. He was not\nin a bed at all as he understood the word, but lying naked on a very\nsoft and yielding mattress, in a trough of dark glass. The mattress\nwas partly transparent, a fact he observed with a strange sense of\ninsecurity, and below it was a mirror reflecting him greyly. About\nhis arm--and he saw with a shock that his skin was strangely dry and\nyellow--was bound a curious apparatus of rubber, bound so cunningly that\nit seemed to pass into his skin above and below. And this strange bed\nwas placed in a case of greenish coloured glass (as it seemed to him), a\nbar in the white framework of which had first arrested his attention.\nIn the corner of the case was a stand of glittering and delicately made\napparatus, for the most part quite strange appliances, though a maximum\nand minimum thermometer was recognisable.\n\nThe slightly greenish tint of the glass-like substance which surrounded\nhim on every hand obscured what lay behind, but he perceived it was a\nvast apartment of splendid appearance, and with a very large and simple\nwhite archway facing him. Close to the walls of the cage were articles\nof furniture, a table covered with a silvery cloth, silvery like the\nside of a fish, a couple of graceful chairs, and on the table a number\nof dishes with substances piled on them, a bottle and two glasses. He\nrealised that he was intensely hungry.\n\nHe could see no human being, and after a period of hesitation scrambled\noff the translucent mattress and tried to stand on the clean white floor\nof his little apartment. He had miscalculated his strength, however,\nand staggered and put his hand against the glasslike pane before him to\nsteady himself. For a moment it resisted his hand, bending outward like\na distended bladder, then it broke with a slight report and vanished--a\npricked bubble. He reeled out into the general space of the hall,\ngreatly astonished. He caught at the table to save himself, knocking one\nof the glasses to the floor--it rang but did not break--and sat down in\none of the armchairs.\n\nWhen he had a little recovered he filled the remaining glass from the\nbottle and drank--a colourless liquid it was, but not water, with a\npleasing faint aroma and taste and a quality of immediate support and\nstimulus. He put down the vessel and looked about him.\n\nThe apartment lost none of its size and magnificence now that the\ngreenish transparency that had intervened was removed. The archway he\nsaw led to a flight of steps, going downward without the intermediation\nof a door, to a spacious transverse passage. This passage ran between\npolished pillars of some white-veined substance of deep ultramarine,\nand along it came the sound of human movements and voices and a deep\nundeviating droning note. He sat, now fully awake, listening alertly,\nforgetting the viands in his attention.\n\nThen with a shock he remembered that he was naked, and casting about him\nfor covering, saw a long black robe thrown on one of the chairs beside\nhim. This he wrapped about him and sat down again, trembling.\n\nHis mind was still a surging perplexity. Clearly he had slept, and had\nbeen removed in his sleep. But here? And who were those people, the\ndistant crowd beyond the deep blue pillars? Boscastle? He poured out and\npartially drank another glass of the colourless fluid.\n\nWhat was this place?--this place that to his senses seemed subtly\nquivering like a thing alive? He looked about him at the clean and\nbeautiful form of the apartment, unstained by ornament, and saw that the\nroof was broken in one place by a circular shaft full of light, and, as\nhe looked, a steady, sweeping shadow blotted it out and passed, and came\nagain and passed. \"Beat, beat,\" that sweeping shadow had a note of its\nown in the subdued tumult that filled the air.\n\nHe would have called out, but only a little sound came into his throat.\nThen he stood up, and, with the uncertain steps of a drunkard, made his\nway towards the archway. He staggered down the steps, tripped on the\ncorner of the black cloak he had wrapped about himself, and saved\nhimself by catching at one of the blue pillars.\n\nThe passage ran down a cool vista of blue and purple, and ended remotely\nin a railed space like a balcony, brightly lit and projecting into a\nspace of haze, a space like the interior of some gigantic building.\nBeyond and remote were vast and vague architectural forms. The tumult of\nvoices rose now loud and clear, and on the balcony and with their backs\nto him, gesticulating and apparently in animated conversation, were\nthree figures, richly dressed in loose and easy garments of bright soft\ncolourings. The noise of a great multitude of people poured up over the\nbalcony, and once it seemed the top of a banner passed, and once some\nbrightly coloured object, a pale blue cap or garment thrown up into the\nair perhaps, flashed athwart the space and fell. The shouts sounded like\nEnglish, there was a reiteration of \"Wake!\" He heard some indistinct\nshrill cry, and abruptly the three men began laughing.\n\n\n\"Ha, ha, ha!\" laughed one--a red-haired man in a short purple robe.\n\"When the Sleeper wakes--_When!_\"\n\nHe turned his eyes full of merriment along the passage. His face\nchanged, the whole man changed, became rigid. The other two turned\nswiftly at his exclamation and stood motionless. Their faces assumed an\nexpression of consternation, an expression that deepened into awe.\n\nSuddenly Graham's knees bent beneath him, his arm against the pillar\ncollapsed limply, he staggered forward and fell upon his face.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. THE SOUND OF A TUMULT\n\nGraham's last impression before he fainted was of a clamorous ringing of\nbells. He learnt afterwards that he was insensible, hanging between life\nand death, for the better part of an hour. When he recovered his senses,\nhe was back on his translucent couch, and there was a stirring warmth\nat heart and throat. The dark apparatus, he perceived, had been removed\nfrom his arm, which was bandaged. The white framework was still about\nhim, but the greenish transparent substance that had filled it was\naltogether gone. A man in a deep violet robe, one of those who had been\non the balcony, was looking keenly into his face.\n\nRemote but insistent was a clamour of bells and confused sounds, that\nsuggested to his mind the picture of a great number of people shouting\ntogether. Something seemed to fall across this tumult, a door suddenly\nclosed.\n\nGraham moved his head. \"What does this all mean?\" he said slowly. \"Where\nam I?\"\n\nHe saw the red-haired man who had been first to discover him. A voice\nseemed to be asking what he had said, and was abruptly stilled.\n\nThe man in violet answered in a soft voice, speaking English with a\nslightly foreign accent, or so at least it seemed to the Sleeper's ears,\n\"You are quite safe. You were brought hither from where you fell asleep.\nIt is quite safe. You have been here some time--sleeping. In a trance.\"\n\nHe said something further that Graham could not hear, and a little phial\nwas handed across to him. Graham felt a cooling spray, a fragrant mist\nplayed over his forehead for a moment, and his sense of refreshment\nincreased. He closed his eyes in satisfaction.\n\n\"Better?\" asked the man in violet, as Graham's eyes reopened. He was a\npleasant-faced man of thirty, perhaps, with a pointed flaxen beard, and\na clasp of gold at the neck of his violet robe.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Graham.\n\n\"You have been asleep some time. In a cataleptic trance. You have heard?\nCatalepsy? It may seem strange to you at first, but I can assure you\neverything is well.\"\n\nGraham did not answer, but these words served their reassuring purpose.\nHis eyes went from face to face of the three people about him. They were\nregarding him strangely. He knew he ought to be somewhere in Cornwall,\nbut he could not square these things with that impression.\n\nA matter that had been in his mind during his last waking moments at\nBoscastle recurred, a thing resolved upon and somehow neglected. He\ncleared his throat.\n\n\"Have you wired my cousin?\" he asked. \"E. Warming, 27, Chancery Lane?\"\n\nThey were all assiduous to hear. But he had to repeat it. \"What an odd\n_blurr_ in his accent!\" whispered the red-haired man. \"Wire, sir?\" said\nthe young man with the flaxen beard, evidently puzzled.\n\n\"He means send an electric telegram,\" volunteered the third, a\npleasant-faced youth of nineteen or twenty. The flaxen-bearded man gave\na cry of comprehension. \"How stupid of me! You may be sure everything\nshall be done, sir,\" he said to Graham. \"I am afraid it would be\ndifficult to--wire to your cousin. He is not in London now. But don't\ntrouble about arrangements yet; you have been asleep a very long time\nand the important thing is to get over that, sir.\" (Graham concluded the\nword was sir, but this man pronounced it \"Sire.\")\n\n\"Oh!\" said Graham, and became quiet.\n\nIt was all very puzzling, but apparently these people in unfamiliar\ndress knew what they were about. Yet they were odd and the room was odd.\nIt seemed he was in some newly established place. He had a sudden flash\nof suspicion. Surely this wasn't some hall of public exhibition! If it\nwas he would give Warming a piece of his mind. But it scarcely had\nthat character. And in a place of public exhibition he would not have\ndiscovered himself naked.\n\nThen suddenly, quite abruptly, he realised what had happened. There was\nno perceptible interval of suspicion, no dawn to his knowledge. Abruptly\nhe knew that his trance had lasted for a vast interval; as if by some\nprocesses of thought reading he interpreted the awe in the faces that\npeered into his. He looked at them strangely, full of intense emotion.\nIt seemed they read his eyes. He framed his lips to speak and could not.\nA queer impulse to hide his knowledge came into his mind almost at the\nmoment of his discovery. He looked at his bare feet, regarding then\nsilently. His impulse to speak passed. He was trembling exceedingly.\n\nThey gave him some pink fluid with a greenish fluorescence and a meaty\ntaste, and the assurance of returning strength grew.\n\n\"That--that makes me feel better,\" he said hoarsely, and there were\nmurmurs of respectful approval. He knew now quite clearly. He made to\nspeak again, and again he could not.\n\nHe pressed his throat and tried a third time.\n\n\"How long?\" he asked in a level voice. \"How long have I been asleep?\"\n\n\"Some considerable time,\" said the flaxen-bearded man, glancing quickly\nat the others.\n\n\"How long?\"\n\n\"A very long time.\"\n\n\"Yes--yes,\" said Graham, suddenly testy. \"But I want--Is it--it is--some\nyears? Many years? There was something--I forget what. I feel--confused.\nBut you--\" He sobbed. \"You need not fence with me. How long--?\"\n\nHe stopped, breathing irregularly. He squeezed his eyes with his\nknuckles and sat waiting for an answer.\n\nThey spoke in undertones.\n\n\"Five or six?\" he asked faintly. \"More?\"\n\n\"Very much more than that.\"\n\n\"More!\"\n\n\"More.\"\n\nHe looked at them and it seemed as though imps were twitching the\nmuscles of his face. He looked his question.\n\n\"Many years,\" said the man with the red beard.\n\nGraham struggled into a sitting position. He wiped a rheumy tear from\nhis face with a lean hand. \"Many years!\" he repeated. He shut his eyes\ntight, opened them, and sat looking about him, from one unfamiliar thing\nto another.\n\n\"How many years?\" he asked.\n\n\"You must be prepared to be surprised.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"More than a gross of years.\"\n\nHe was irritated at the strange word. \"More than a _what_?\"\n\nTwo of them spoke together. Some quick remarks that were made about\n\"decimal\" he did not catch.\n\n\"How long did you say?\" asked Graham. \"How long? Don't look like that.\nTell me.\"\n\nAmong the remarks in an undertone, his ear caught six words: \"More than\na couple of centuries.\"\n\n\n_\"What?\"_ he cried, turning on the youth who he thought had spoken. \"Who\nsays--? What was that? A couple of centuries!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the man with the red beard. \"Two hundred years.\"\n\nGraham repeated the words. He had been prepared to hear of a vast\nrepose, and yet these concrete centuries defeated him.\n\n\"Two hundred years,\" he said again, with the figure of a great gulf\nopening very slowly in his mind; and then, \"Oh, but--!\"\n\nThey said nothing.\n\n\"You--did you say--?\"\n\n\"Two hundred years. Two centuries of years,\" said the man with the red\nbeard.\n\nThere was a pause. Graham looked at their faces and saw that what he had\nheard was indeed true.\n\n\"But it can't be,\" he said querulously. \"I am dreaming. Trances. Trances\ndon't last. That is not right--this is a joke you have played upon\nme! Tell me--some days ago, perhaps, I was walking along the coast of\nCornwall--?\"\n\nHis voice failed him.\n\nThe man with the flaxen beard hesitated. \"I'm not very strong in\nhistory, sir,\" he said weakly, and glanced at the others.\n\n\"That was it, sir,\" said the youngster. \"Boscastle, in the old Duchy of\nCornwall--it's in the southwest country beyond the dairy meadows. There\nis a house there still. I have been there.\"\n\n\"Boscastle!\" Graham turned his eyes to the youngster. \"That was\nit--Boscastle. Little Boscastle. I fell asleep--somewhere there. I don't\nexactly remember. I don't exactly remember.\"\n\nHe pressed his brows and whispered, \"More than two hundred years!\"\n\nHe began to speak quickly with a twitching face, but his heart was cold\nwithin him. \"But if it is two hundred years, every soul I know, every\nhuman being that ever I saw or spoke to before I went to sleep, must be\ndead.\"\n\nThey did not answer him.\n\n\"The Queen and the Royal Family, her Ministers, of Church and State.\nHigh and low, rich and poor, one with another--\"\n\n\"Is there England still?\"\n\n\"That's a comfort! Is there London? Eh?\" \"This _is_ London, eh? And you\nare my assistant--custodian; assistant-custodian. And these--? Eh?\nAssistant-custodians to?\"\n\nHe sat with a gaunt stare on his face. \"But why am I here? No! Don't\ntalk. Be quiet. Let me--\"\n\nHe sat silent, rubbed his eyes, and, uncovering them, found another\nlittle glass of pinkish fluid held towards him. He took the dose. It was\nalmost immediately sustaining. Directly he had taken it he began to weep\nnaturally and refreshingly.\n\nPresently he looked at their faces, suddenly laughed through his tears,\na little foolishly. \"But--two--hun--dred--years!\" he said. He grimaced\nhysterically and covered up his face again.\n\nAfter a space he grew calm. He sat up, his hands hanging over his knees\nin almost precisely the same attitude in which Isbister had found him\non the cliff at Pentargen. His attention was attracted by a thick\ndomineering voice, the footsteps of an advancing personage. \"What are\nyou doing? Why was I not warned? Surely you could tell? Someone will\nsuffer for this. The man must be kept quiet. Are the doorways closed?\nAll the doorways? He must be kept perfectly quiet. He must not be told.\nHas he been told anything?\"\n\nThe man with the fair beard made some inaudible remark, and Graham\nlooking over his shoulder saw approaching a very short, fat, and\nthickset beardless man, with aquiline nose and heavy neck and chin. Very\nthick black and slightly sloping eyebrows that almost met over his\nnose and overhung deep grey eyes, gave his face an oddly formidable\nexpression. He scowled momentarily at Graham and then his regard\nreturned to the man with the flaxen beard. \"These others,\" he said in a\nvoice of extreme irritation. \"You had better go.\"\n\n\"Go?\" said the red-bearded man.\n\n\"Certainly--go now. But see the doorways are closed as you go.\"\n\nThe two men addressed turned obediently, after one reluctant glance at\nGraham, and instead of going through the archway as he expected, walked\nstraight to the dead wall of the apartment opposite the archway. And\nthen came a strange thing; a long strip of this apparently solid wall\nrolled up with a snap, hung over the two retreating men and fell again,\nand immediately Graham was alone with the new comer and the purple-robed\nman with the flaxen beard.\n\nFor a space the thickset man took not the slightest notice of Graham,\nbut proceeded to interrogate the other--obviously his subordinate--upon\nthe treatment of their charge. He spoke clearly, but in phrases only\npartially intelligible to Graham. The awakening seemed not only a matter\nof surprise but of consternation and annoyance to him. He was evidently\nprofoundly excited.\n\n\"You must not confuse his mind by telling him things,\" he repeated again\nand again. \"You must not confuse his mind.\"\n\nHis questions answered, he turned quickly and eyed the awakened sleeper\nwith an ambiguous expression.\n\n\"Feel queer?\" he asked.\n\n\"Very.\"\n\n\"The world, what you see of it, seems strange to you?\"\n\n\"I suppose I have to live in it, strange as it seems.\"\n\n\"I suppose so, now.\"\n\n\"In the first place, hadn't I better have some clothes?\"\n\n\"They--\" said the thickset man and stopped, and the flaxen-bearded man\nmet his eye and went away. \"You will very speedily have clothes,\" said\nthe thickset man.\n\n\"Is it true indeed, that I have been asleep two hundred--?\" asked\nGraham.\n\n\"They have told you that, have they? Two hundred and three, as a matter\nof fact.\"\n\nGraham accepted the indisputable now with raised eyebrows and depressed\nmouth. He sat silent for a moment, and then asked a question, \"Is there\na mill or dynamo near here?\" He did not wait for an answer. \"Things have\nchanged tremendously, I suppose?\" he said.\n\n\"What is that shouting?\" he asked abruptly.\n\n\"Nothing,\" said the thickset man impatiently. \"It's people. You'll\nunderstand better later--perhaps. As you say, things have changed.\" He\nspoke shortly, his brows were knit, and he glanced about him like a man\ntrying to decide in an emergency. \"We must get you clothes and so forth,\nat any rate. Better wait here until some can come. No one will come near\nyou. You want shaving.\"\n\nGraham rubbed his chin.\n\nThe man with the flaxen beard came back towards them, turned suddenly,\nlistened for a moment, lifted his eyebrows at the older man, and hurried\noff through the archway towards the balcony. The tumult of shouting\ngrew louder, and the thickset man turned and listened also. He cursed\nsuddenly under his breath, and turned his eyes upon Graham with an\nunfriendly expression. It was a surge of many voices, rising and\nfalling, shouting and screaming, and once came a sound like blows and\nsharp cries, and then a snapping like the crackling of dry sticks.\nGraham strained his ears to draw some single thread of sound from the\nwoven tumult.\n\nThen he perceived, repeated again and again, a certain formula. For a\ntime he doubted his ears. But surely these were the words: \"Show us the\nSleeper! Show us the Sleeper!\"\n\nThe thickset man rushed suddenly to the archway.\n\n\"Wild!\" he cried, \"How do they know? Do they know? Or is it guessing?\"\n\nThere was perhaps an answer.\n\n\"I can't come,\" said the thickset man; \"I have _him_ to see to. But\nshout from the balcony.\"\n\nThere was an inaudible reply.\n\n\"Say he is not awake. Anything! I leave it to you.\"\n\nHe came hurrying back to Graham. \"You must have clothes at once,\" he\nsaid. \"You cannot stop here--and it will be impossible to--\"\n\nHe rushed away, Graham shouting unanswered questions after him. In a\nmoment he was back.\n\n\"I can't tell you what is happening. It is too complex to explain. In\na moment you shall have your clothes made. Yes--in a moment. And then\nI can take you away from here. You will find out our troubles soon\nenough.\"\n\n\"But those voices. They were shouting--?\"\n\n\"Something about the Sleeper--that's you. They have some twisted idea. I\ndon't know what it is. I know nothing.\"\n\nA shrill bell jetted acutely across the indistinct mingling of remote\nnoises, and this brusque person sprang to a little group of appliances\nin the corner of the room. He listened for a moment, regarding a ball of\ncrystal, nodded, and said a few indistinct words; then he walked to the\nwall through which the two men had vanished. It rolled up again like a\ncurtain, and he stood waiting.\n\nGraham lifted his arm and was astonished to find what strength the\nrestoratives had given him. He thrust one leg over the side of the couch\nand then the other. His head no longer swam. He could scarcely credit\nhis rapid recovery. He sat feeling his limbs.\n\nThe man with the flaxen beard re-entered from the archway, and as he did\nso the cage of a lift came sliding down in front of the thickset\nman, and a lean, grey-bearded man, carrying a roll, and wearing a\ntightly-fitting costume of dark green, appeared therein.\n\n\"This is the tailor,\" said the thickset man with an introductory\ngesture. \"It will never do for you to wear that black. I cannot\nunderstand how it got here. But I shall. I shall. You will be as rapid\nas possible?\" he said to the tailor.\n\nThe man in green bowed, and, advancing, seated himself by Graham on the\nbed. His manner was calm, but his eyes were full of curiosity. \"You will\nfind the fashions altered, Sire,\" he said. He glanced from under his\nbrows at the thickset man.\n\nHe opened the roller with a quick movement, and a confusion of brilliant\nfabrics poured out over his knees. \"You lived, Sire, in a period\nessentially cylindrical--the Victorian. With a tendency to the\nhemisphere in hats. Circular curves always. Now--\" He flicked out a\nlittle appliance the size and appearance of a keyless watch, whirled the\nknob, and behold--a little figure in white appeared kinetoscope fashion\non the dial, walking and turning. The tailor caught up a pattern of\nbluish white satin. \"That is my conception of your immediate treatment,\"\nhe said.\n\nThe thickset man came and stood by the shoulder of Graham.\n\n\"We have very little time,\" he said.\n\n\"Trust me,\" said the tailor. \"My machine follows. What do you think of\nthis?\"\n\n\"What is that?\" asked the man from the nineteenth century.\n\n\"In your days they showed you a fashion-plate,\" said the tailor, \"but\nthis is our modern development See here.\" The little figure repeated\nits evolutions, but in a different costume. \"Or this,\" and with a click\nanother small figure in a more voluminous type of robe marched on to\nthe dial. The tailor was very quick in his movements, and glanced twice\ntowards the lift as he did these things.\n\nIt rumbled again, and a crop-haired anaemic lad with features of the\nChinese type, clad in coarse pale blue canvas, appeared together with a\ncomplicated machine, which he pushed noiselessly on little castors into\nthe room. Incontinently the little kinetoscope was dropped, Graham was\ninvited to stand in front of the machine and the tailor muttered some\ninstructions to the crop-haired lad, who answered in guttural tones and\nwith words Graham did not recognise. The boy then went to conduct an\nincomprehensible monologue in the corner, and the tailor pulled out a\nnumber of slotted arms terminating in little discs, pulling them out\nuntil the discs were flat against the body of Graham, one at each\nshoulder blade, one at the elbows, one at the neck and so forth, so that\nat last there were, perhaps, two score of them upon his body and limbs.\nAt the same time, some other person entered the room by the lift,\nbehind Graham. The tailor set moving a mechanism that initiated a\nfaint-sounding rhythmic movement of parts in the machine, and in another\nmoment he was knocking up the levers and Graham was released. The tailor\nreplaced his cloak of black, and the man with the flaxen beard proffered\nhim a little glass of some refreshing fluid. Graham saw over the rim of\nthe glass a pale-faced young man regarding him with a singular fixity.\n\n\nThe thickset man had been pacing the room fretfully, and now turned and\nwent through the archway towards the balcony, from which the noise of\na distant crowd still came in gusts and cadences. The cropheaded lad\nhanded the tailor a roll of the bluish satin and the two began fixing\nthis in the mechanism in a manner reminiscent of a roll of paper in a\nnineteenth century printing machine. Then they ran the entire thing on\nits easy, noiseless bearings across the room to a remote corner where\na twisted cable looped rather gracefully from the wall. They made some\nconnexion and the machine became energetic and swift.\n\n\"What is that doing?\" asked Graham, pointing with the empty glass to\nthe busy figures and trying to ignore the scrutiny of the new comer. \"Is\nthat--some sort of force--laid on?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the man with the flaxen beard.\n\n\"Who is that?\" He indicated the archway behind him.\n\nThe man in purple stroked his little beard, hesitated, and answered in\nan undertone, \"He is Howard, your chief guardian. You see, Sire,--it's\na little difficult to explain. The Council appoints a guardian and\nassistants. This hall has under certain restrictions been public. In\norder that people might satisfy themselves. We have barred the doorways\nfor the first time. But I think--if you don't mind, I will leave him to\nexplain.\"\n\n\"Odd\" said Graham. \"Guardian? Council?\" Then turning his back on the new\ncomer, he asked in an undertone, \"Why is this man glaring at me? Is he a\nmesmerist?\"\n\n\"Mesmerist! He is a capillotomist.\"\n\n\"Capillotomist!\"\n\n\"Yes--one of the chief. His yearly fee is sixdoz lions.\"\n\nIt sounded sheer nonsense. Graham snatched at the last phrase with an\nunsteady mind. \"Sixdoz lions?\" he said.\n\n\"Didn't you have lions? I suppose not. You had the old pounds? They are\nour monetary units.\"\n\n\"But what was that you said--sixdoz?\"\n\n\"Yes. Six dozen, Sire. Of course things, even these little things,\nhave altered. You lived in the days of the decimal system, the Arab\nsystem--tens, and little hundreds and thousands. We have eleven numerals\nnow. We have single figures for both ten and eleven, two figures for\na dozen, and a dozen dozen makes a gross, a great hundred, you know, a\ndozen gross a dozand, and a dozand dozand a myriad. Very simple?\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" said Graham. \"But about this cap--what was it?\"\n\nThe man with the flaxen beard glanced over his shoulder.\n\n\"Here are your clothes!\" he said. Graham turned round sharply and saw\nthe tailor standing at his elbow smiling, and holding some palpably new\ngarments over his arm. The crop-headed boy, by means of one finger,\nwas impelling the complicated machine towards the lift by which he had\narrived. Graham stared at the completed suit. \"You don't mean to say--!\"\n\n\"Just made,\" said the tailor. He dropped the garments at the feet of\nGraham, walked to the bed on which Graham had so recently been lying,\nflung out the translucent mattress, and turned up the looking glass. As\nhe did so a furious bell summoned the thickset man to the corner. The\nman with the flaxen beard rushed across to him and then hurried out by\nthe archway.\n\nThe tailor was assisting Graham into a dark purple combination garment,\nstockings, vest, and pants in one, as the thickset man came back from\nthe corner to meet the man with the flaxen beard returning from the\nbalcony. They began speaking quickly in an undertone, their bearing had\nan unmistakable quality of anxiety. Over the purple under-garment came a\ncomplex but graceful garment of bluish white, and I Graham was clothed\nin the fashion once more and saw himself, sallow-faced, unshaven and\nshaggy still, but at least naked no longer, and in some indefinable\nunprecedented way graceful.\n\n\"I must shave,\" he said regarding himself in the glass.\n\n\"In a moment,\" said Howard.\n\nThe persistent stare ceased. The young man closed his eyes, reopened\nthem, and with a lean hand extended, advanced on Graham. Then he\nstopped, with his hand slowly gesticulating, and looked about him.\n\n\"A seat,\" said Howard impatiently, and in a moment the flaxen-bearded\nman had a chair behind Graham. \"Sit down, please,\" said Howard.\n\nGraham hesitated, and in the other hand of the wildeyed man he saw the\nglint of steel.\n\n\"Don't you understand, Sire?\" cried the flaxen-bearded man with hurried\npoliteness. \"He is going to cut your hair.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Graham enlightened. \"But you called him--\n\n\"A capillotomist--precisely! He is one of the finest artists in the\nworld.\"\n\nGraham sat down abruptly. The flaxen-bearded man disappeared. The\ncapillotomist came forward with graceful gestures, examined Graham's\nears and surveyed him, felt the back of his head, and would have sat\ndown again to regard him but for Howard's audible impatience. Forthwith\nwith rapid movements and a succession of deftly handled implements he\nshaved Graham's chin, clipped his moustache, and cut and arranged his\nhair. All this he did without a word, with something of the rapt air of\na poet inspired. And as soon as he had finished Graham was handed a pair\nof shoes.\n\nSuddenly a loud voice shouted--it seemed from a piece of machinery in\nthe corner--\"At once--at once. The people know all over the city. Work\nis being stopped. Work is being stopped. Wait for nothing, but come.\"\n\nThis shout appeared to perturb Howard exceedingly. By his gestures it\nseemed to Graham that he hesitated between two directions. Abruptly\nhe went towards the corner where the apparatus stood about the little\ncrystal ball. As he did so the undertone of tumultuous shouting from the\narchway that had continued during all these occurrences rose to a mighty\nsound, roared as if it were sweeping past, and fell again as if receding\nswiftly. It drew Graham after it with an irresistible attraction. He\nglanced at the thickset man, and then obeyed his impulse. In two strides\nhe was down the steps and in the passage, and, in a score he was out\nupon the balcony upon which the three men had been standing.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. THE MOVING WAYS\n\nHe went to the railings of the balcony and stared upward. An exclamation\nof surprise at his appearance, and the movements of a number of people\ncame from the spacious area below.\n\nHis first impression was of overwhelming architecture. The place into\nwhich he looked was an aisle of Titanic buildings, curving spaciously in\neither direction. Overhead mighty cantilevers sprang together across the\nhuge width of the place, and a tracery of translucent material shut out\nthe sky. Gigantic globes of cool white light shamed the pale sunbeams\nthat filtered down through the girders and wires. Here and there a\ngossamer suspension bridge dotted with foot passengers flung across the\nchasm and the air was webbed with slender cables. A cliff of edifice\nhung above him, he perceived as he glanced upward, and the opposite\nfacade was grey and dim and broken by great archings, circular\nperforations, balconies, buttresses, turret projections, myriads of vast\nwindows, and an intricate scheme of architectural relief. Athwart these\nran inscriptions horizontally and obliquely in an unfamiliar lettering.\nHere and there close to the roof cables of a peculiar stoutness were\nfastened, and drooped in a steep curve to circular openings on the\nopposite side of the space, and even as Graham noted these a remote\nand tiny figure of a man clad in pale blue arrested his attention.\nThis little figure was far overhead across the space beside the higher\nfastening of one of these festoons, hanging forward from a little ledge\nof masonry and handling some well-nigh invisible strings dependent from\nthe line. Then suddenly, with a swoop that sent Graham's heart into his\nmouth, this man had rushed down the curve and vanished through a round\nopening on the hither side of the way. Graham had been looking up as he\ncame out upon the balcony, and the things he saw above and opposed to\nhim had at first seized his attention to the exclusion of anything else.\nThen suddenly he discovered the roadway! It was not a roadway at all,\nas Graham understood such things, for in the nineteenth century the\nonly roads and streets were beaten tracks of motionless earth, jostling\nrivulets of vehicles between narrow footways. But this roadway was three\nhundred feet across, and it moved; it moved, all save the middle,\nthe lowest part. For a moment, the motion dazzled his mind. Then he\nunderstood.\n\nUnder the balcony this extraordinary roadway ran swiftly to Graham's\nright, an endless flow rushing along as fast as a nineteenth century\nexpress train, an endless platform of narrow transverse overlapping\nslats with little interspaces that permitted it to follow the curvatures\nof the street. Upon it were seats, and here and there little kiosks,\nbut they swept by too swiftly for him to see what might be therein. From\nthis nearest and swiftest platform a series of others descended to the\ncentre of the space. Each moved to the right, each perceptibly slower\nthan the one above it, but the difference in pace was small enough to\npermit anyone to step from any platform to the one adjacent, and so walk\nuninterruptedly from the swiftest to the motionless middle way. Beyond\nthis middle way was another series of endless platforms rushing with\nvarying pace to Graham's left. And seated in crowds upon the two widest\nand swiftest platforms, or stepping from one to another down the steps,\nor swarming over the central space, was an innumerable and wonderfully\ndiversified multitude of people.\n\n\"You must not stop here,\" shouted Howard suddenly at his side. \"You must\ncome away at once.\"\n\nGraham made no answer. He heard without hearing. The platforms ran with\na roar and the people were shouting. He perceived women and girls\nwith flowing hair, beautifully robed, with bands crossing between the\nbreasts. These first came out of the confusion. Then he perceived that\nthe dominant note in that kaleidoscope of costume was the pale blue that\nthe tailor's boy had worn. He became aware of cries of \"The Sleeper.\nWhat has happened to the Sleeper?\" and it seemed as though the rushing\nplatforms before him were suddenly spattered with the pale buff of\nhuman faces, and then still more thickly. He saw pointing fingers. He\nperceived that the motionless central area of this huge arcade just\nopposite to the balcony was densely crowded with blue-clad people. Some\nsort of struggle had sprung into life. People seemed to be pushed up the\nrunning platforms on either side, and carried away against their will.\nThey would spring off so soon as they were beyond the thick of the\nconfusion, and run back towards the conflict.\n\n\"It is the Sleeper. Verily it is the Sleeper,\" shouted voices. \"That is\nnever the Sleeper,\" shouted others. More and more faces were turned to\nhim. At the intervals along this central area Graham noted openings,\npits, apparently the heads of staircases going down with people\nascending out of them and descending into them. The struggle it seemed\ncentred about the one of these nearest to him. People were running\ndown the moving platforms to this, leaping dexterously from platform to\nplatform. The clustering people on the higher platforms seemed to divide\ntheir interest between this point and the balcony. A number of sturdy\nlittle figures clad in a uniform of bright red, and working methodically\ntogether, were employed it seemed in preventing access to this\ndescending staircase. About them a crowd was rapidly accumulating.\nTheir brilliant colour contrasted vividly with the whitish-blue of their\nantagonists, for the struggle was indisputable.\n\nHe saw these things with Howard shouting in his ear and shaking his arm.\nAnd then suddenly Howard was gone and he stood alone.\n\nHe perceived that the cries of \"The Sleeper\" grew in volume, and that\nthe people on the nearer platform were standing up. The nearer swifter\nplatform he perceived was empty to the right of him, and far across the\nspace the platform running in the opposite direction was coming crowded\nand passing away bare. With incredible swiftness a vast crowd had\ngathered in the central space before his eyes; a dense swaying mass\nof people, and the shouts grew from a fitful crying to a voluminous\nincessant clamour: \"The Sleeper! The Sleeper!\" and yells and cheers, a\nwaving of garments and cries of \"Stop the ways!\" They were also crying\nanother name strange to Graham. It sounded like \"Ostrog.\" The slower\nplatforms were soon thick with active people, running against the\nmovement so as to keep themselves opposite to him.\n\n\"Stop the ways,\" they cried. Agile figures ran up swiftly from the\ncentre to the swift road nearest to him, were borne rapidly past him,\nshouting strange, unintelligible things, and ran back obliquely to the\ncentral way. One thing he distinguished: \"It is indeed the Sleeper. It\nis indeed the Sleeper,\" they testified.\n\nFor a space Graham stood without a movement. Then he became vividly\naware that all this concerned him. He was pleased at his wonderful\npopularity, he bowed, and, seeking a gesture of longer range, waved his\narm. He was astonished at the violence of uproar that this provoked. The\ntumult about the descending stairway rose to furious violence. He\nbecame aware of crowded balconies, of men sliding along ropes, of men\nin trapeze-like seats hurling athwart the space. He heard voices behind\nhim, a number of people descending the steps through the archway; he\nsuddenly perceived that his guardian Howard was back again and gripping\nhis arm painfully, and shouting inaudibly in his ear.\n\nHe turned, and Howard's face was white. \"Come back,\" he heard. \"They\nwill stop the ways. The whole city will be in confusion.\"\n\nHe perceived a number of men hurrying along the passage of blue pillars\nbehind Howard, the red-haired man, the man with the flaxen beard, a tall\nman in vivid vermilion, a crowd of others in red carrying staves, and\nall these people had anxious eager faces.\n\n\"Get him away,\" cried Howard.\n\n\"But why?\" said Graham. \"I don't see--\"\n\n\"You must come away!\" said the man in red in a resolute voice. His face\nand eyes were resolute, too. Graham's glances went from face to face,\nand he was suddenly aware of that most disagreeable flavour in life,\ncompulsion. Some one gripped his arm.... He was being dragged away. It\nseemed as though the tumult suddenly became two, as if half the shouts\nthat had come in from this wonderful roadway had sprung into the\npassages of the great building behind him. Marvelling and confused,\nfeeling an impotent desire to resist, Graham was half led, half thrust,\nalong the passage of blue pillars, and suddenly he found himself alone\nwith Howard in a lift and moving swiftly upward.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. THE HALL OF THE ATLAS\n\nFrom the moment when the tailor had bowed his farewell to the moment\nwhen Graham found himself in the lift, was altogether barely five\nminutes. And as yet the haze of his vast interval of sleep hung about\nhim, as yet the initial strangeness of his being alive at all in\nthis remote age touched everything with wonder, with a sense of the\nirrational, with something of the quality of a realistic dream. He was\nstill detached, an astonished spectator, still but half involved in\nlife. What he had seen, and especially the last crowded tumult, framed\nin the setting of the balcony, had a spectacular turn, like a thing\nwitnessed from the box of a theatre. \"I don't understand,\" he said.\n\"What was the trouble? My mind is in a whirl. Why were they shouting?\nWhat is the danger?\"\n\n\"We have our troubles,\" said Howard. His eyes avoided Graham's enquiry.\n\"This is a time of unrest. And, in fact, your appearance, your waking\njust now, has a sort of connexion--\"\n\nHe spoke jerkily, like a man not quite sure of his breathing. He stopped\nabruptly.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" said Graham.\n\n\"It will be clearer later,\" said Howard.\n\nHe glanced uneasily upward, as though he found the progress of the lift\nslow.\n\n\"I shall understand better, no doubt, when I have seen my way about\na little,\" said Graham puzzled. \"It will be--it is bound to be\nperplexing. At present it is all so strange. Anything seems possible.\nAnything. In the details even. Your counting, I understand, is\ndifferent.\"\n\nThe lift stopped, and they stepped out into a narrow but very long\npassage between high walls, along which ran an extraordinary number of\ntubes and big cables.\n\n\"What a huge place this is!\" said Graham. \"Is it all one building? What\nplace is it?\"\n\n\"This is one of the city ways for various public services. Light and so\nforth.\"\n\n\"Was it a social trouble--that--in the great roadway place? How are you\ngoverned? Have you still a police?\" \"Several,\" said Howard.\n\n\"Several?\"\n\n\"About fourteen.\"\n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\n\"Very probably not. Our social order will probably seem very complex to\nyou. To tell you the truth, I don't understand it myself very clearly.\nNobody does. You will, perhaps--bye and bye. We have to go to the\nCouncil.\"\n\nGraham's attention was divided between the urgent necessity of his\ninquiries and the people in the passages and halls they were traversing.\nFor a moment his mind would be concentrated upon Howard and the halting\nanswers he made, and then he would lose the thread in response to some\nvivid unexpected impression. Along the passages, in the halls, half the\npeople seemed to be men in the red uniform. The pale blue canvas\nthat had been so abundant in the aisle of moving ways did not appear.\nInvariably these men looked at him, and saluted him and Howard as they\npassed.\n\nHe had a clear vision of entering a long corridor, and there were a\nnumber of girls sitting on low seats and as though in a class. He saw\nno teacher, but only a novel apparatus from which he fancied a voice\nproceeded. The girls regarded him and his conductor, he thought, with\ncuriosity and astonishment. But he was hurried on before he could form a\nclear idea of the gathering. He judged they knew Howard and not himself,\nand that they wondered who he was. This Howard, it seemed, was a person\nof importance. But then he was also merely Graham's guardian. That was\nodd.\n\nThere came a passage in twilight, and into this passage a footway hung\nso that he could see the feet and ankles of people going to and fro\nthereon, but no more of them. Then vague impressions of galleries and\nof casual astonished passers-by turning round to stare after the two of\nthem with their red-clad guard.\n\nThe stimulus of the restoratives he had taken was only temporary. He was\nspeedily fatigued by this excessive haste. He asked Howard to slacken\nhis speed. Presently he was in a lift that had a window upon the great\nstreet space, but this was glazed and did not open, and they were too\nhigh for him to see the moving platforms below. But he saw people going\nto and fro along cables and along strange, frail-looking ridges.\n\nAnd thence they passed across the street and at a vast height above it.\nThey crossed by means of a narrow bridge closed in with glass, so clear\nthat it made him giddy even to remember it. The floor of it also was of\nglass. From his memory of the cliffs between New Quay and Boscastle, so\nremote in time, and so recent in his experience, it seemed to him that\nthey must be near four hundred feet above the moving ways. He stopped,\nlooked down between his legs upon the swarming blue and red multitudes,\nminute and fore-shortened, struggling and gesticulating still towards\nthe little balcony far below, a little toy balcony, it seemed, where he\nhad so recently been standing. A thin haze and the glare of the mighty\nglobes of light obscured everything. A man seated in a little open-work\ncradle shot by from some point still higher than the little narrow\nbridge, rushing down a cable as swiftly almost as if he were falling.\nGraham stopped involuntarily to watch this strange passenger vanish in\na great circular opening below, and then his eyes went back to the\ntumultuous struggle.\n\nAlong one of the swifter ways rushed a thick crowd of red spots. This\nbroke up into individuals as it approached the balcony, and went pouring\ndown the slower ways towards the dense struggling crowd on the central\narea. These men in red appeared to be armed with sticks or truncheons;\nthey seemed to be striking and thrusting. A great shouting, cries of\nwrath, screaming, burst out and came up to Graham, faint and thin. \"Go\non,\" cried Howard, laying hands on him.\n\nAnother man rushed down a cable. Graham suddenly glanced up to see\nwhence he came, and beheld through the glassy roof and the network of\ncables and girders, dim rhythmically passing forms like the vans of\nwindmills, and between them glimpses of a remote and pallid sky. Then\nHoward had thrust him forward across the bridge, and he was in a little\nnarrow passage decorated with geometrical patterns.\n\n\"I want to see more of that,\" cried Graham, resisting.\n\n\"No, no,\" cried Howard, still gripping his arm.\n\n\"This way. You must go this way.\" And the men in red following them\nseemed ready to enforce his orders.\n\nSome negroes in a curious wasp-like uniform of black and yellow appeared\ndown the passage, and one hastened to throw up a sliding shutter that\nhad seemed a door to Graham, and led the way through it. Graham found\nhimself in a gallery overhanging the end of a great chamber. The\nattendant in black and yellow crossed this, thrust up a second shutter\nand stood waiting.\n\nThis place had the appearance of an ante-room. He saw a number of people\nin the central space, and at the opposite end a large and imposing\ndoorway at the top of a flight of steps, heavily curtained but giving a\nglimpse of some still larger hall beyond. He perceived white men in\nred and other negroes in black and yellow standing stiffly about those\nportals.\n\nAs they crossed the gallery he heard a whisper from below, \"The\nSleeper,\" and was aware of a turning of heads, a hum of observation.\nThey entered another little passage in the wall of this ante-chamber,\nand then he found himself on an iron-railed gallery of metal that\npassed round the side of the great hall he had already seen through the\ncurtains. He entered the place at the corner, so that he received\nthe fullest impression of its huge proportions. The black in the wasp\nuniform stood aside like a well-trained servant, and closed the valve\nbehind him.\n\nCompared with any of the places Graham had see thus far, this second\nhall appeared to be decorate with extreme richness. On a pedestal at\nthe remote end, and more brilliantly lit than any other object, was a\ngigantic white figure of Atlas, strong and strenuous, the globe upon his\nbowed shoulders. It was the first thing to strike his attention, it was\nso vast, so patiently and painfully real, so white and simple. Save for\nthis figure and for a dais in the centre, the wide floor of the place\nwas a shining vacancy. The dais was remote in the greatness of the area;\nit would have looked a mere slab of metal had it not been for the group\nof seven men who stood about a table on it, and gave an inkling of its\nproportions. They were all dressed in white robes, they seemed to have\narisen that moment from their seats, and they were regarding Graham\nsteadfastly. At the end of the table he perceived the glitter of some\nmechanical appliances.\n\nHoward led him along the end gallery until they were opposite this\nmighty labouring figure. Then he stopped. The two men in red who had\nfollowed them into the gallery came and stood on either hand of Graham.\n\n\"You must remain here,\" murmured Howard, \"for a few moments,\" and,\nwithout waiting for a reply, hurried away along the gallery.\n\n\"But, _why?_\" began Graham.\n\nHe moved as if to follow Howard, and found his path obstructed by one of\nthe men in red. \"You have to wait here, Sire,\" said the man in red.\n\n_\"Why?\"_\n\n\"Orders, Sire.\"\n\n\"Whose orders?\"\n\n\"Our orders, Sire.\"\n\nGraham looked his exasperation.\n\n\"What place is this?\" he said presently. \"Who are those men?\"\n\n\"They are the lords of the Council, Sire.\"\n\n\"What Council?\"\n\n\"_The_ Council.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Graham, and after an equally ineffectual attempt at the other\nman, went to the railing and stared at the distant men in white, who\nstood watching him and whispering together.\n\nThe Council? He perceived there were now eight, though how the newcomer\nhad arrived he had not observed. They made no gestures of greeting; they\nstood regarding him as in the nineteenth century a group of men might\nhave stood in the street regarding a distant balloon that had suddenly\nfloated into view. What council could it be that gathered there, that\nlittle body of men beneath the significant white Atlas, secluded from\nevery eavesdropper in this impressive spaciousness? And why should he\nbe brought to them, and be looked at strangely and spoken of inaudibly?\nHoward appeared beneath, walking quickly across the polished floor\ntowards them. As he drew near he bowed and performed certain peculiar\nmovements, apparently of a ceremonious nature. Then he ascended the\nsteps of the dais, and stood by the apparatus at the end of the table.\n\nGraham watched that visible inaudible conversation. Occasionally, one\nof the white-robed men would glance towards him. He strained his ears\nin vain. The gesticulation of two of the speakers became animated. He\nglanced from them to the passive faces of his attendants.... When he\nlooked again Howard was extending his hands and moving his head like\na man who protests. He was interrupted, it seemed, by one of the\nwhite-robed men rapping the table.\n\nThe conversation lasted an interminable time to Graham's sense. His\neyes rose to the still giant at whose feet the Council sat. Thence they\nwandered at last to the walls of the hall. It was decorated in long\npainted panels of a quasi-Japanese type, many of them very beautiful.\nThese panels were grouped in a great and elaborate framing of dark\nmetal, which passed into the metallic caryatidae of the galleries, and\nthe great structural lines of the interior. The facile grace of these\npanels enhanced the mighty white effort that laboured in the centre\nof the scheme. Graham's eyes came back to the Council, and Howard\nwas descending the steps. As he drew nearer his features could be\ndistinguished, and Graham saw that he was flushed and blowing out his\ncheeks. His countenance was still disturbed when presently he reappeared\nalong the gallery.\n\n\"This way,\" he said concisely, and they went on in silence to a little\ndoor that opened at their approach. The two men in red stopped on either\nside of this door. Howard and Graham passed in, and Graham, glancing\nback, saw the white-robed Council still standing in a close group and\nlooking at him. Then the door closed behind him with a heavy thud, and\nfor the first time since his awakening he was in silence. The floor,\neven, was noiseless to his feet.\n\nHoward opened another door, and they were in the first of two contiguous\nchambers furnished in white and green. \"What Council was that?\" began\nGraham. \"What were they discussing? What have they to do with me?\"\nHoward closed the door carefully, heaved a huge sigh, and said something\nin an undertone. He walked slanting ways across the room and turned,\nblowing out his cheeks again. \"Ugh!\" he grunted, a man relieved.\n\nGraham stood regarding him.\n\n\"You must understand,\" began Howard abruptly, avoiding Graham's eyes,\n\"that our social order is very complex. A half explanation, a bare\nunqualified statement would give you false impressions. As a matter of\nfact--it is a case of compound interest partly--your small fortune, and\nthe fortune of your cousin Warming which was left to you--and certain\nother beginnings--have become very considerable. And in other ways\nthat will be hard for you to understand, you have become a person of\nsignificance--of very considerable significance--involved in the world's\naffairs.\"\n\nHe stopped.\n\n\"Yes?\" said Graham.\n\n\"We have grave social troubles.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Things have come to such a pass that, in fact, is advisable to seclude\nyou here.\"\n\n\"Keep me prisoner!\" exclaimed Graham.\n\n\"Well--to ask you to keep in seclusion.\"\n\nGraham turned on him. \"This is strange!\" he said.\n\n\"No harm will be done you.\"\n\n\"No harm!\"\n\n\"But you must be kept here--\"\n\n\"While I learn my position, I presume.\"\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\n\"Very well then. Begin. Why _harm?_\"\n\n\"Not now.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"It is too long a story, Sire.\"\n\n\"All the more reason I should begin at once. You say I am a person of\nimportance. What was that shouting I heard? Why is a great multitude\nshouting and excited because my trance is over, and who are the men in\nwhite in that huge council chamber?\"\n\n\"All in good time, Sire,\" said Howard. \"But not crudely, not crudely.\nThis is one of those flimsy times when no man has a settled mind. Your\nawakening. No one expected your awakening. The Council is consulting.\"\n\n\"What council?\"\n\n\"The Council you saw.\"\n\nGraham made a petulant movement. \"This is not right,\" he said. \"I should\nbe told what is happening.\n\n\"You must wait. Really you must wait.\"\n\nGraham sat down abruptly. \"I suppose since I have waited so long to\nresume life,\" he said, \"that I must wait a little longer.\"\n\n\"That is better,\" said Howard. \"Yes, that is much better. And I must\nleave you alone. For a space. While I attend the discussion in the\nCouncil. I am sorry.\"\n\nHe went towards the noiseless door, hesitated and vanished.\n\nGraham walked to the door, tried it, found it securely fastened in\nsome way he never came to understand, turned about, paced the room\nrestlessly, made the circuit of the room, and sat down. He remained\nsitting for some time with folded arms and knitted brow, biting his\nfinger nails and trying to piece together the kaleidoscopic impressions\nof this first hour of awakened life; the vast mechanical spaces, the\nendless series of chambers and passages, the great struggle that roared\nand splashed through these strange ways, the little group of remote\nunsympathetic men beneath the colossal Atlas, Howard's mysterious\nbehaviour. There was an inkling of some vast inheritance already in\nhis mind--a vast inheritance perhaps misapplied--of some unprecedented\nimportance and opportunity. What had he to do? And this room's secluded\nsilence was eloquent of imprisonment!\n\nIt came into Graham's mind with irresistible conviction that this series\nof magnificent impressions was a dream. He tried to shut his eyes and\nsucceeded, but that time-honoured device led to no awakening.\n\nPresently he began to touch and examine all the unfamiliar appointments\nof the two small rooms in which he found himself.\n\nIn a long oval panel of mirror he saw himself and stopped astonished. He\nwas clad in a graceful costume of purple and bluish white, with a little\ngreyshot beard trimmed to a point, and his hair, its blackness streaked\nnow with bands of grey, arranged over his forehead in an unfamiliar but\ngraceful manner. He seemed a man of five-and-forty perhaps. For a moment\nhe did not perceive this was himself.\n\nA flash of laughter came with the recognition. \"To call on old Warming\nlike this!\" he exclaimed, \"and make him take me out to lunch!\"\n\nThen he thought of meeting first one and then another of the few\nfamiliar acquaintances of his early manhood, and in the midst of his\namusement realised that every soul with whom he might jest had died\nmany score of years ago. The thought smote him abruptly and keenly;\nhe stopped short, the expression of his face changed to a white\nconsternation.\n\nThe tumultuous memory of the moving platforms and the huge facade of\nthat wonderful street reasserted itself. The shouting multitudes came\nback clear and vivid, and those remote, inaudible, unfriendly councilors\nin white. He felt himself a little figure, very small and ineffectual,\npitifully conspicuous. And all about him, the world was--strange.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. IN THE SILENT ROOMS\n\nPresently Graham resumed his examination of his apartments. Curiosity\nkept him moving in spite of his fatigue. The inner room, he perceived,\nwas high, and its ceiling dome shaped, with an oblong aperture in the\ncentre, opening into a funnel in which a wheel of broad fans seemed to\nbe rotating, apparently driving the air up the shaft. The faint humming\nnote of its easy motion was the only clear sound in that quiet place. As\nthese vans sprang up one after the other, Graham could get transient\nglimpses of the sky. He was surprised to see a star.\n\nThis drew his attention to the fact that the bright lighting of these\nrooms was due to a multitude of very faint glow lamps set about the\ncornices. There were no windows. And he began to recall that along\nall the vast chambers and passages he had traversed with Howard he had\nobserved no windows at all. Had there been windows? There were windows\non the street indeed, but were they for light? Or was the whole city lit\nday and night for evermore, so that there was no night there?\n\nAnd another thing dawned upon him. There was no fireplace in either\nroom. Was the season summer, and were these merely summer apartments, or\nwas the whole City uniformly heated or cooled? He became interested in\nthese questions, began examining the smooth texture of the walls, the\nsimply constructed bed, the ingenious arrangements by which the labour\nof bedroom service was practically abolished. And over everything was a\ncurious absence of deliberate ornament, a bare grace of form and\ncolour, that he found very pleasing to the eye. There were several very\ncomfortable chairs, a light table on silent runners carrying several\nbottles of fluids and glasses, and two plates bearing a clear substance\nlike jelly. Then he noticed there were no books, no newspapers, no\nwriting materials. \"The world has changed indeed,\" he said.\n\nHe observed one entire side of the outer room was set with rows of\npeculiar double cylinders inscribed with green lettering on white that\nharmonized with the decorative scheme of the room, and in the centre of\nthis side projected a little apparatus about a yard square and having a\nwhite smooth face to the room. A chair faced this. He had a transitory\nidea that these cylinders might be books, or a modern substitute for\nbooks, but at first it did not seem so.\n\nThe lettering on the cylinders puzzled him. At first sight it seemed\nlike Russian. Then he noticed a suggestion of mutilated English about\ncertain of the words.\n\n                   \"oi Man huwdbi Kin\"\n\nforced itself on him as \"The Man who would be King.\" \"Phonetic\nspelling,\" he said. He remembered reading a story with that title, then\nhe recalled the story vividly, one of the best stories in the world. But\nthis thing before him was not a book as he understood it. He puzzled out\nthe titles of two adjacent cylinders. 'The Heart of Darkness,' he had\nnever heard of before nor 'The Madonna of the Future'--no doubt if they\nwere indeed stories, they were by post Victorian authors.\n\nHe puzzled over this peculiar cylinder for some time and replaced it.\nThen he turned to the square apparatus and examined that. He opened a\nsort of lid and found one of the double cylinders within, and on the\nupper edge a little stud like the stud of an electric bell. He pressed\nthis and a rapid clicking began and ceased. He became aware of voices\nand music, and noticed a play of colour on the smooth front face. He\nsuddenly realised what this might be, and stepped back to regard it.\n\nOn the flat surface was now a little picture, very vividly coloured,\nand in this picture were figures that moved. Not only did they move, but\nthey were conversing in clear small voices. It was exactly like reality\nviewed through an inverted opera glass and heard through a long tube.\nHis interest was seized at once by the situation, which presented a\nman pacing up and down and vociferating angry things to a pretty but\npetulant woman. Both were in the picturesque costume that seemed so\nstrange to Graham. \"I have worked,\" said the man, \"but what have you\nbeen doing?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Graham. He forgot everything else, and sat down in the chair.\nWithin five minutes he heard himself named, heard \"when the Sleeper\nwakes,\" used jestingly as a proverb for remote postponement, and passed\nhimself by, a thing remote and incredible. But in a little while he knew\nthose two people like intimate friends.\n\nAt last the miniature drama came to an end, and the square face of the\napparatus was blank again.\n\nIt was a strange world into which he had been permitted to see,\nunscrupulous, pleasure seeking, energetic, subtle, a world too of dire\neconomic struggle; there were allusions he did not understand, incidents\nthat conveyed strange suggestions of altered moral ideals, flashes of\ndubious enlightenment. The blue canvas that bulked so largely in his\nfirst impression of the city ways appeared again and again as\nthe costume of the common people. He had no doubt the story was\ncontemporary, and its intense realism was undeniable. And the end had\nbeen a tragedy that oppressed him. He sat staring at the blankness.\n\nHe started and rubbed his eyes. He had been so absorbed in the\nlatter-day substitute for a novel, that he awoke to the little green\nand white room with more than a touch of the surprise of his first\nawakening.\n\nHe stood up, and abruptly he was back in his own wonderland. The\nclearness of the kinetoscope drama passed, and the struggle in the vast\nplace of streets, the ambiguous Council, the swift phases of his waking\nhour, came back. These people had spoken of the Council with suggestions\nof a vague universality of power. And they had spoken of the Sleeper; it\nhad not really struck him vividly at the time that he was the Sleeper.\nHe had to recall precisely what they had said.\n\nHe walked into the bedroom and peered up through the quick intervals of\nthe revolving fan. As the fan swept round, a dim turmoil like the noise\nof machinery came in rhythmic eddies. All else was silence.\n\n\nThough the perpetual day still irradiated his apartments, he perceived\nthe little intermittent strip of sky was now deep blue--black almost,\nwith a dust of little stars.\n\nHe resumed his examination of the rooms. He could find no way of opening\nthe padded door, no bell nor other means of calling for attendance.\nHis feeling of wonder was in abeyance; but he was curious, anxious for\ninformation. He wanted to know exactly how he stood to these new things.\nHe tried to compose himself to wait until someone came to him. Presently\nhe became restless and eager for information, for distraction, for fresh\nsensations.\n\nHe went back to the apparatus in the other room, and had soon puzzled\nout the method of replacing the cylinders by others. As he did so, it\ncame into his mind that it must be these little appliances had fixed the\nlanguage so that it was still clear and understandable after two hundred\nyears. The haphazard cylinders he substituted displayed a musical\nfantasia. At first it was beautiful, and then it was sensuous. He\npresently recognized what appeared to him to be an altered version of\nthe story of Tannhauser. The music was unfamiliar. But the rendering was\nrealistic, and with a contemporary unfamiliarity. Tannhauser did not\ngo to a Venusberg, but to a Pleasure City. What was a Pleasure City? A\ndream, surely, the fancy of a fantastic, voluptuous writer.\n\nHe became interested, curious. The story developed with a flavour of\nstrangely twisted sentimentality. Suddenly he did not like it. He liked\nit less as it proceeded.\n\nHe had a revulsion of feeling. These were no pictures, no idealisations,\nbut photographed realities. He wanted no more of the twenty-second\ncentury Venusberg. He forgot the part played by the model in nineteenth\ncentury art, and gave way to an archaic indignation. He rose, angry and\nhalf ashamed at himself for witnessing this thing even in solitude. He\npulled forward the apparatus, and with some violence sought for a means\nof stopping its action. Something snapped. A violet spark stung and\nconvulsed his arm and the thing was still. When he attempted next day\nto replace these Tannhauser cylinders by another pair, he found the\napparatus broken....\n\nHe struck out a path oblique to the room and paced to and fro,\nstruggling with intolerable vast impressions. The things he had derived\nfrom the cylinders and the things he had seen, conflicted, confused him.\nIt seemed to him the most amazing thing of all that in his thirty years\nof life he had never tried to shape a picture of these coming times.\n\"We were making the future,\" he said, \"and hardly any of us troubled to\nthink what future we were making. And here it is!\"\n\n\"What have they got to, what has been done? How do I come into the midst\nof it all?\" The vastness of street and house he was prepared for,\nthe multitudes of people. But conflicts in the city ways! And the\nsystematised sensuality of a class of rich men!\n\nHe thought of Bellamy, the hero of whose Socialistic Utopia had so\noddly anticipated this actual experience. But here was no Utopia,\nno Socialistic state. He had already seen enough to realise that the\nancient antithesis of luxury, waste and sensuality on the one hand and\nabject poverty on the other, still prevailed. He knew enough of the\nessential factors of life to understand that correlation. And not only\nwere the buildings of the city gigantic and the crowds in the street\ngigantic, but the voices he had heard in the ways, the uneasiness of\nHoward, the very atmosphere spoke of gigantic discontent. What country\nwas he in? Still England it seemed, and yet strangely \"un-English.\" His\nmind glanced at the rest of the world, and saw only an enigmatical veil.\n\nHe prowled about his apartment, examining everything as a caged animal\nmight do. He felt very tired, felt that feverish exhaustion that does\nnot admit of rest. He listened for long spaces under the ventilator to\ncatch some distant echo of the tumults he felt must be proceeding in the\ncity.\n\nHe began to talk to himself. \"Two hundred and three years!\" he said to\nhimself over and over again, laughing stupidly. \"Then I am two hundred\nand thirty-three years old! The oldest inhabitant. Surely they haven't\nreversed the tendency of our time and gone back to the rule of the\noldest. My claims are indisputable. Mumble, mumble. I remember the\nBulgarian atrocities as though it was yesterday. 'Tis a great age!\nHa ha!\" He was surprised at first to hear himself laughing, and then\nlaughed again deliberately and louder. Then he realised that he was\nbehaving foolishly. \"Steady,\" he said. \"Steady!\"\n\nHis pacing became more regular. \"This new world,\" he said. \"I don't\nunderstand it. _Why?_... But it is all _why!_\"\n\n\"I suppose they can fly and do all sorts of things Let me try and\nremember just how it began.\"\n\nHe was surprised at first to find how vague the memories of his first\nthirty years had become. He remembered fragments, for the most part\ntrivial moments, things of no great importance that he had observed. His\nboyhood seemed the most accessible at first, he recalled school books\nand certain lessons in mensuration. Then he revived the more salient\nfeatures of his life, memories of the wife long since dead, her magic\ninfluence now gone beyond corruption, of his rivals and friends and\nbetrayers, of the swift decision of this issue and that, and then of\nhis, last years of misery, of fluctuating resolves, and at last of his\nstrenuous studies. In a little while he perceived he had it all again;\ndim perhaps, like metal long laid aside, but in no way defective or\ninjured, capable of re-polishing. And the hue of it was a deepening\nmisery. Was it worth re-polishing? By a miracle he had been lifted out\nof a life that had become intolerable.\n\nHe reverted to his present condition. He wrestled with the facts in\nvain. It became an inextricable tangle. He saw the sky through the\nventilator pink with dawn. An old persuasion came out of the dark\nrecesses of his memory. \"I must sleep,\" he said. It appeared as a\ndelightful relief from this mental distress and from the growing pain\nand heaviness of his limbs. He went to the strange little bed, lay down\nand was presently asleep.\n\nHe was destined to become very familiar indeed with these apartments\nbefore he left them, for he remained imprisoned for three days. During\nthat time no one, except Howard, entered his prison. The marvel of his\nfate mingled with and in some way minimised the marvel of his survival.\nHe had awakened to mankind it seemed only to be snatched away into this\nunaccountable solitude. Howard came regularly with subtly sustaining and\nnutritive fluids, and light and pleasant foods, quite strange to Graham.\nHe always closed the door carefully as he entered. On matters of detail\nhe was increasingly obliging, but the bearing of Graham on the great\nissues that were evidently being contested so closely beyond the\nsoundproof walls that enclosed him, he would not elucidate. He evaded,\nas politely as possible, every question on the position of affairs in\nthe outer world.\n\nAnd in those three days Graham's incessant thoughts went far and wide.\nAll that he had seen, all this elaborate contrivance to prevent\nhim seeing, worked together in his mind. Almost every possible\ninterpretation of his position he debated--even as it chanced, the right\ninterpretation. Things that presently happened to him, came to him at\nlast credible, by virtue of this seclusion. When at length the moment of\nhis release arrived, it found him prepared.\n\nHoward's bearing went far to deepen Graham's impression of his own\nstrange importance; the door between its opening and closing seemed to\nadmit with him a breath of momentous happening. His enquiries became\nmore definite and searching. Howard retreated through protests and\ndifficulties. The awakening was unforeseen, he repeated; it happened to\nhave fallen in with the trend of a social convulsion.\n\n\"To explain it I must tell you the history of a gross and a half of\nyears,\" protested Howard.\n\n\"The thing is this,\" said Graham. \"You are afraid of something I shall\ndo. In some way I am arbitrator--I might be arbitrator.\"\n\n\"It is not that. But you have--I may tell you this much--the automatic\nincrease of your property puts great possibilities of interference in\nyour hands. And in certain other ways you have influence, with your\neighteenth century notions.\"\n\n\"Nineteenth century,\" corrected Graham.\n\n\"With your old world notions, anyhow, ignorant as you are of every\nfeature of our State.\"\n\n\"Am I a fool?\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"Do I seem to be the sort of man who would act rashly?\"\n\n\"You were never expected to act at all. No one counted on your\nawakening. No one dreamt you would ever awake. The Council had\nsurrounded you with antiseptic conditions. As a matter of fact, we\nthought that you were dead--a mere arrest of decay. And--but it is too\ncomplex. We dare not suddenly--while you are still half awake.\"\n\n\"It won't do,\" said Graham. \"Suppose it is as you say--why am I not\nbeing crammed night and day with facts and warnings and all the wisdom\nof the time to fit me for my responsibilities? Am I any wiser now than\ntwo days ago, if it is two days, when I awoke?\"\n\nHoward pulled his lip.\n\n\"I am beginning to feel--every hour I feel more clearly--a sense of\ncomplex concealment of which you are the salient point. Is this Council,\nor committee, or whatever they are, cooking the accounts of my estate?\nIs that it?\"\n\n\"That note of suspicion--\" said Howard.\n\n\"Ugh!\" said Graham. \"Now, mark my words, it will be ill for those who\nhave put me here. It will be ill. I am alive. Make no doubt of it, I\nam alive. Every day my pulse is stronger and my mind clearer and more\nvigorous. No more quiescence. I am a man come back to life. And I want\nto _live_--\"\n\n\"_Live!_\"\n\nHoward's face lit with an idea. He came towards Graham and spoke in an\neasy confidential tone.\n\n\"The Council secludes you here for your good. You are restless.\nNaturally--an energetic man! You find it dull here. But we are anxious\nthat everything you may desire--every desire--every sort of desire...\nThere may be something. Is there any sort of company?\"\n\nHe paused meaningly.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Graham thoughtfully. \"There is.\"\n\n\"Ah! _Now!_ We have treated you neglectfully.\"\n\n\"The crowds in yonder streets of yours.\"\n\n\"That,\" said Howard, \"I am afraid--. But--\"\n\nGraham began pacing the room. Howard stood near the door watching him.\nThe implication of Howard's suggestion was only half evident to Graham\nCompany? Suppose he were to accept the proposal, demand some sort\nof _company_? Would there be any possibilities of gathering from\nthe conversation of this additional person some vague inkling of\nthe struggle that had broken out so vividly at his waking moment? He\nmeditated again, and the suggestion took colour. He turned on Howard\nabruptly.\n\n\"What do you mean by company?\"\n\nHoward raised his eyes and shrugged his shoulders. \"Human beings,\" he\nsaid, with a curious smile on his heavy face.\n\n\"Our social ideas,\" he said, \"have a certain increased liberality,\nperhaps, in comparison with your times. If a man wishes to relieve such\na tedium as this--by feminine society, for instance. We think it no\nscandal. We have cleared our minds of formulae. There is in our city a\nclass, a necessary class, no longer despised--discreet--\"\n\nGraham stopped dead.\n\n\"It would pass the time,\" said Howard. \"It is a thing I should\nperhaps have thought of before, but, as a matter of fact, so much is\nhappening--\"\n\nHe indicated the exterior world.\n\nGraham hesitated. For a moment the figure of a possible woman that\nhis imagination suddenly created dominated his mind with an intense\nattraction. Then he flashed into anger.\n\n\"No!\" he shouted.\n\nHe began striding rapidly up and down the room.\n\n\"Everything you say, everything you do, convinces me--of some great\nissue in which I am concerned. I do not want to pass the time, as you\ncall it. Yes, I know. Desire and indulgence are life in a sense--and\nDeath! Extinction! In my life before I slept I had worked out\nthat pitiful question. I will not begin again. There is a city, a\nmultitude--. And meanwhile I am here like a rabbit in a bag.\"\n\nHis rage surged high. He choked for a moment and began to wave his\nclenched fists. He gave way to an anger fit, he swore archaic curses.\nHis gestures had the quality of physical threats.\n\n\"I do not know who your party may be. I am in the dark, and you keep\nme in the dark. But I know this, that I am secluded here for no\ngood purpose. For no good purpose. I warn you, I warn you of the\nconsequences. Once I come at my power--\"\n\nHe realised that to threaten thus might be a danger to himself. He\nstopped. Howard stood regarding him with a curious expression.\n\n\"I take it this is a message to the Council,\" said Howard.\n\nGraham had a momentary impulse to leap upon the man, fell or stun him.\nIt must have shown upon his face; at any rate Howard's movement was\nquick. In a second the noiseless door had closed again, and the man from\nthe nineteenth century was alone.\n\nFor a moment he stood rigid, with clenched hands half raised. Then he\nflung them down. \"What a fool I have been!\" he said, and gave way to\nhis anger again, stamping about the room and shouting curses. For a long\ntime he kept himself in a sort of frenzy, raging at his position, at his\nown folly, at the knaves who had imprisoned him. He did this because\nhe did not want to look calmly at his position. He clung to his\nanger--because he was afraid of Fear.\n\nPresently he found himself reasoning with himself This imprisonment was\nunaccountable, but no doubt the legal forms--new legal forms--of the\ntime permitted it. It must, of course, be legal. These people were two\nhundred years further on in the march of civilisation than the Victorian\ngeneration. It was not likely they would be less--humane. Yet they\nhad cleared their minds of formulae! Was humanity a formula as well as\nchastity?\n\nHis imagination set to work to suggest things that might be done to him.\nThe attempts of his reason to dispose of these suggestions, though\nfor the most part logically valid, were quite unavailing. \"Why should\nanything be done to me?\"\n\n\"If the worst comes to the worst,\" he found himself saying at last, \"I\ncan give up what they want. But what do they want? And why don't they\nask me for it instead of cooping me up?\"\n\nHe returned to his former preoccupation with the Council's possible\nintentions. He began to reconsider the details of Howard's behaviour,\nsinister glances, inexplicable hesitations. Then, for a time, his mind\ncircled about the idea of escaping from these rooms; but whither could\nhe escape into this vast, crowded world? He would be worse off than\na Saxon yeoman suddenly dropped into nineteenth century London. And\nbesides, how could anyone escape from these rooms?\n\n\"How can it benefit anyone if harm should happen to me?\"\n\nHe thought of the tumult, the great social trouble of which he was so\nunaccountably the axis. A text, irrelevant enough and yet curiously\ninsistent, came floating up out of the darkness of his memory. This also\na Council had said:\n\n\"It is expedient for us that one man should die for the people.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. THE ROOF SPACES\n\nAs the fans in the circular aperture of the inner room rotated and\npermitted glimpses of the night, dim sounds drifted in thereby. And\nGraham, standing underneath, wrestling darkly with the unknown powers\nthat imprisoned him, and which he had now deliberately challenged, was\nstartled by the sound of a voice.\n\nHe peered up and saw in the intervals of the rotation, dark and dim,\nthe face and shoulders of a man regarding him. When a dark hand was\nextended, the swift fan struck it, swung round and beat on with a little\nbrownish patch on the edge of its thin blade, and something began to\nfall therefrom upon the floor, dripping silently.\n\nGraham looked down, and there were spots of blood at his feet. He looked\nup again in a strange excitement. The figure had gone.\n\nHe remained motionless--his every sense intent upon the flickering patch\nof darkness, for outside it was high night. He became aware of some\nfaint, remote, dark specks floating lightly through the outer air. They\ncame down towards him, fitfully, eddyingly, and passed aside out of\nthe uprush from the fan. A gleam of light flickered, the specks flashed\nwhite, and then the darkness came again. Warmed and lit as he was, he\nperceived that it was snowing within a few feet of him.\n\nGraham walked across the room and came back to the ventilator again. He\nsaw the head of a man pass near. There was a sound of whispering. Then\na smart blow on some metallic substance, effort, voices, and the vans\nstopped. A gust of snowflakes whirled into the room, and vanished before\nthey touched the floor. \"Don't be afraid,\" said a voice.\n\nGraham stood under the fan. \"Who are you?\" he whispered.\n\nFor a moment there was nothing but a swaying of the fan, and then the\nhead of a man was thrust cautiously into the opening. His face appeared\nnearly inverted to Graham; his dark hair was wet with dissolving flakes\nof snow upon it. His arm went up into the darkness holding something\nunseen. He had a youthful face and bright eyes, and the veins of his\nforehead were swollen. He seemed to be exerting himself to maintain his\nposition.\n\nFor several seconds neither he nor Graham spoke.\n\n\"You were the Sleeper?\" said the stranger at last.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Graham. \"What do you want with me?\"\n\n\"I come from Ostrog, Sire.\"\n\n\"Ostrog?\"\n\nThe man in the ventilator twisted his head round so that his profile was\ntowards Graham. He appeared to be listening. Suddenly there was a hasty\nexclamation, and the intruder sprang back just in time to escape the\nsweep of the released fan. And when Graham peered up there was nothing\nvisible but the slowly falling snow.\n\nIt was perhaps a quarter of an hour before anything returned to the\nventilator. But at last came the same metallic interference again; the\nfans stopped and the face reappeared. Graham had remained all this time\nin the same place, alert and tremulously excited.\n\n\"Who are you? What do you want?\" he said.\n\n\"We want to speak to you, Sire,\" said the intruder.\n\n\"We want--I can't hold the thing. We have been trying to find a way to\nyou these three days.\"\n\n\"Is it rescue?\" whispered Graham. \"Escape?\"\n\n\"Yes, Sire. If you will.\"\n\n\"You are my party--the party of the Sleeper?\"\n\n\"Yes, Sire.\"\n\n\"What am I to do?\" said Graham.\n\nThere was a struggle. The stranger's arm appeared, and his hand was\nbleeding. His knees came into view over the edge of the funnel. \"Stand\naway from me,\" he said, and he dropped rather heavily on his hands and\none shoulder at Graham's feet. The released ventilator whirled noisily.\nThe stranger rolled over, sprang up nimbly and stood panting, hand to a\nbruised shoulder, and with his bright eyes on Graham.\n\n\"You are indeed the Sleeper,\" he said. \"I saw you asleep. When it was\nthe law that anyone might see you.\"\n\n\"I am the man who was in the trance,\" said Graham. \"They have imprisoned\nme here. I have been here since I awoke--at least three days.\"\n\nThe intruder seemed about to speak, heard something, glanced swiftly at\nthe door, and suddenly left Graham and ran towards it, shouting quick\nincoherent words. A bright wedge of steel flashed in his hand, and he\nbegan tap, tap, a quick succession of blows upon the hinges. \"Mind!\"\ncried a voice. \"Oh!\" The voice came from above.\n\nGraham glanced up, saw the soles of two feet, ducked, was struck on the\nshoulder by one of them, and a heavy weight bore him to the earth. He\nfell on his knees and forward, and the weight went over his head. He\nknelt up and saw a second man from above seated before him.\n\n\"I did not see you, Sire,\" panted the man. He rose and assisted Graham\nto arise. \"Are you hurt, Sire?\" he panted. A succession of heavy blows\non the ventilator began, something fell close to Graham's face, and a\nshivering edge of white metal danced, fell over, and lay flat upon the\nfloor.\n\n\"What is this?\" cried Graham, confused and looking at the ventilator.\n\"Who are you? What are you going to do? Remember, I understand nothing.\"\n\n\"Stand back,\" said the stranger, and drew him from under the ventilator\nas another fragment of metal fell heavily.\n\n\"We want you to come, Sire,\" panted the newcomer, and Graham glancing\nat his face again, saw a new cut had changed from white to red on his\nforehead, and a couple of little trickles of blood starting therefrom.\n\"Your people call for you.\"\n\n\"Come where? My people?\"\n\n\"To the hall about the markets. Your life is in danger here. We have\nspies. We learned but just in time. The Council has decided--this very\nday--either to drug or kill you. And everything is ready. The people are\ndrilled, the wind-vane police, the engineers, and half the way-gearers\nare with us. We have the halls crowded--shouting. The whole city shouts\nagainst the Council. We have arms.\" He wiped the blood with his hand.\n\"Your life here is not worth--\" \"But why arms?\"\n\n\"The people have risen to protect you, Sire. What?\"\n\nHe turned quickly as the man who had first come down made a hissing\nwith his teeth. Graham saw the latter start back, gesticulate to them to\nconceal themselves, and move as if to hide behind the opening door.\n\nAs he did so Howard appeared, a little tray in one hand and his heavy\nface downcast. He started, looked up, the door slammed behind him, the\ntray tilted sideways, and the steel wedge struck him behind the ear. He\nwent down like a felled tree, and lay as he fell athwart the floor of\nthe outer room. The man who had struck him bent hastily, studied his\nface for a moment, rose, and returned to his work at the door.\n\n\"Your poison!\" said a voice in Graham's ear.\n\nThen abruptly they were in darkness. The innumerable cornice lights\nhad been extinguished. Graham saw the aperture of the ventilator with\nghostly snow whirling above it and dark figures moving hastily. Three\nknelt on the fan. Some dim thing--a ladder was being lowered through the\nopening, and a hand appeared holding a fitful yellow light.\n\nHe had a moment of hesitation. But the manner of these men, their swift\nalacrity, their words, marched so completely with his own fears of\nthe Council, with his idea and hope of a rescue, that it lasted not a\nmoment. And his people awaited him!\n\n\"I do not understand,\" he said, \"I trust. Tell me what to do.\"\n\nThe man with the cut brow gripped Graham's arm.\n\n\"Clamber up the ladder,\" he whispered. \"Quick. They will have heard--\"\n\nGraham felt for the ladder with extended hands, put his foot on the\nlower rung, and, turning his head, saw over the shoulder of the nearest\nman, in the yellow flicker of the light, the first-comer astride over\nHoward and still working at the door. Graham turned to the ladder again,\nand was thrust by his conductor and helped up by those above, and then\nhe was standing on something hard and cold and slippery outside the\nventilating funnel.\n\nHe shivered. He was aware of a great difference in the temperature. Half\na dozen men stood about him, and light flakes of snow touched hands and\nface and melted. For a moment it was dark, then for a flash a ghastly\nviolet white, and then everything was dark again.\n\nHe saw he had come out upon the roof of the vast city structure which\nhad replaced the miscellaneous houses, streets and open spaces of\nVictorian London. The place upon which he stood was level, with huge\nserpentine cables lying athwart it in every direction. The circular\nwheels of a number of windmills loomed indistinct and gigantic through\nthe darkness and snowfall, and roared with a varying loudness as the\nfitful white light smote up from below, touched the snow eddies with a\ntransient glitter, and made an evanescent spectre in the night; and\nhere and there, low down! some vaguely outlined wind-driven mechanism\nflickered with livid sparks.\n\nAll this he appreciated in a fragmentary manner as his rescuers stood\nabout him. Someone threw a thick soft cloak of fur-like texture about\nhim, and fastened it by buckled straps at waist and shoulders. Things\nwere said briefly, decisively. Someone thrust him forward.\n\nBefore his mind was yet clear a dark shape gripped his arm. \"This way,\"\nsaid this shape, urging him along, and pointed Graham across the flat\nroof in the direction of a dim semicircular haze of light. Graham\nobeyed.\n\n\"Mind!\" said a voice, as Graham stumbled against a cable. \"Between them\nand not across them,\" said the voice. And, \"We must hurry.\"\n\n\"Where are the people?\" said Graham. \"The people you said awaited me?\"\n\nThe stranger did not answer. He left Graham's arm as the path grew\nnarrower, and led the way with rapid strides. Graham followed blindly.\nIn a minute he found himself running. \"Are the others coming?\" he\npanted, but received no reply. His companion glanced back and ran on.\nThey came to a sort of pathway of open metal-work, transverse to the\ndirection they had come, and they turned aside to follow this. Graham\nlooked back, but the snowstorm had hidden the others.\n\n\"Come on!\" said his guide. Running now, they drew near a little windmill\nspinning high in the air. \"Stoop,\" said Graham's guide, and they avoided\nan endless band running roaring up to the shaft of the vane. \"This\nway!\" and they were ankle deep in a gutter full of drifted thawing snow,\nbetween two low walls of metal that presently rose waist high. \"I will\ngo first,\" said the guide. Graham drew his cloak about him and followed.\nThen suddenly came a narrow abyss across which the gutter leapt to the\nsnowy darkness of the further side. Graham peeped over the side once and\nthe gulf was black. For a moment he regretted his flight. He dared not\nlook again, and his brain spun as he waded through the half liquid snow.\n\nThen out of the gutter they clambered and hurried across a wide flat\nspace damp with thawing snow, and for half its extent dimly translucent\nto lights that went to and fro underneath. He hesitated at this unstable\nlooking substance, but his guide ran on unheeding, and so they came to\nand clambered up slippery steps to the rim of a great dome of glass.\nRound this they went. Far below a number of people seemed to be dancing,\nand music filtered through the dome.... Graham fancied he heard a\nshouting through the snowstorm, and his guide hurried him on with a new\nspurt of haste. They clambered panting to a space of huge windmills, one\nso vast that only the lower edge of its vans came rushing into sight and\nrushed up again and was lost in the night and the snow. They hurried for\na time through the colossal metallic tracery of its supports, and came\nat last above a place of moving platforms like the place into which\nGraham had looked from the balcony. They crawled across the sloping\ntransparency that covered this street of platforms, crawling on hands\nand knees because of the slipperiness of the snowfall.\n\nFor the most part the glass was bedewed, and Graham saw only hazy\nsuggestions of the forms below, but near the pitch of the transparent\nroof the glass was clear, and he found himself looking sheerly down upon\nit all. For awhile, in spite of the urgency of his guide, he gave way\nto vertigo and lay spread-eagled on the glass, sick and paralysed. Far\nbelow, mere stirring specks and dots, went the people of the unsleeping\ncity in their perpetual daylight, and the moving platforms ran on their\nincessant journey. Messengers and men on unknown businesses shot along\nthe drooping cables and the frail bridges were crowded with men. It was\nlike peering into a gigantic glass hive, and it lay vertically below him\nwith only a tough glass of unknown thickness to save him from a fall.\nThe street showed warm and lit, and Graham was wet now to the skin with\nthawing snow, and his feet were numbed with cold. For a space he could\nnot move.\n\n\"Come on!\" cried his guide, with terror in his voice. \"Come on!\"\n\nGraham reached the pitch of the roof by an effort.\n\nOver the ridge, following his guide's example, he turned about and slid\nbackward down the opposite slope very swiftly, amid a little avalanche\nof snow While he was sliding he thought of what would happen if some\nbroken gap should come in his way. At the edge he stumbled to his feet\nankle deep in slush thanking heaven for an opaque footing again. His\nguide was already clambering up a metal screen to a level expanse.\n\nThrough the spare snowflakes above this loomed another line of vast\nwindmills, and then suddenly the amorphous tumult of the rotating wheels\nwas pierced with a deafening sound. It was a mechanical shrilling of\nextraordinary intensity that seemed to come simultaneously from every\npoint of the compass.\n\n\"They have missed us already!\" cried Graham's guide in an accent of\nterror, and suddenly, with a blinding flash, the night became day.\n\nAbove the driving snow, from the summits of the wind-wheels, appeared\nvast masts carrying globes of livid light. They receded in illimitable\nvistas in every direction. As far as his eye could penetrate the\nsnowfall they glared.\n\n\"Get on this,\" cried Graham's conductor, and thrust him forward to a\nlong grating of snowless metal that ran like a band between two slightly\nsloping expanses of snow. It felt warm to Graham's benurrled feet, and a\nfaint eddy of steam rose from it.\n\n\"Come on!\" shouted his guide ten yards off, and, without waiting, ran\nswiftly through the incandescent glare towards the iron supports of the\nnext range of wind-wheels. Graham, recovering from his astonishment,\nfollowed as fast, convinced of his imminent capture.\n\nIn a score of seconds they were within a tracery of glare and black\nshadows shot with moving bars beneath the monstrous wheels. Graham's\nconductor ran on for some time, and suddenly darted sideways and\nvanished into a black shadow in the corner of the foot of a huge\nsupport. In another moment Graham was beside him.\n\nThey cowered panting and stared out.\n\nThe scene upon which Graham looked was very wild and strange. The snow\nhad now almost ceased; only a belated flake passed now and again across\nthe picture. But the broad stretch of level before them was a ghastly\nwhite, broken only by gigantic masses and moving shapes and lengthy\nstrips of impenetrable darkness, vast ungainly Titans of shadow. All\nabout them, huge metallic structures, iron girders, inhumanly vast as it\nseemed to him, interlaced, and the edges of wind-wheels, scarcely moving\nin the lull, passed in great shining curves steeper and steeper up\ninto a luminous haze. Wherever the snow-spangled light struck down,\nbeams and girders, and incessant bands running with a halting,\nindomitable resolution passed upward and downward into the black. And\nwith all that mighty activity, with an omnipresent sense of motive and\ndesign, this snow-clad desolation of mechanism seemed void of all\nhuman presence save themselves, seemed as trackless and deserted and\nunfrequented by men as some inaccessible Alpine snowfield.\n\n\"They will be chasing us,\" cried the leader. \"We are scarcely halfway\nthere yet. Cold as it is we must hide here for a space--at least until\nit snows more thickly again.\"\n\nHis teeth chattered in his head.\n\n\"Where are the markets?\" asked Graham staring out. \"Where are all the\npeople?\"\n\nThe other made no answer.\n\n\n\"Look!\" whispered Graham, crouched close, and became very still.\n\nThe snow had suddenly become thick again, and sliding with the whirling\neddies out of the black pit of the sky came something, vague and large\nand very swift. It came down in a steep curve and swept round, wide\nwings extended and a trail of white condensing steam behind it, rose\nwith an easy swiftness and went gliding up the air, swept horizontally\nforward in a wide curve, and vanished again in the steaming specks of\nsnow. And, through the ribs of its body, Graham saw two little men, very\nminute and active, searching the snowy areas about him, as it seemed to\nhim, with field glasses. For a second they were clear, then hazy through\na thick whirl of snow, then small and distant, and in a minute they were\ngone.\n\n\"Now!\" cried his companion. \"Come!\"\n\nHe pulled Graham's sleeve, and incontinently the two were running\nheadlong down the arcade of ironwork beneath the wind-wheels. Graham,\nrunning blindly, collided with his leader, who had turned back on him\nsuddenly. He found himself within a dozen yards of a black chasm. It\nextended as far as he could see right and left. It seemed to cut off\ntheir progress in either direction.\n\n\"Do as I do,\" whispered his guide. He lay down and crawled to the edge,\nthrust his head over and twisted until one leg hung. He seemed to feel\nfor something with his foot, found it, and went sliding over the edge\ninto the gulf. His head reappeared. \"It is a ledge,\" he whispered. \"In\nthe dark all the way along. Do as I did.\"\n\nGraham hesitated, went down upon all fours, crawled to the edge, and\npeered into a velvety blackness. For a sickly moment he had courage\nneither to go on nor retreat, then he sat and hung his leg down, felt\nhis guide's hands pulling at him, had a horrible sensation of sliding\nover the edge into the unfathomable, splashed, and felt himself in a\nslushy gutter, impenetrably dark.\n\n\"This way,\" whispered the voice, and he began crawling along the gutter\nthrough the trickling thaw, pressing himself against the wall. They\ncontinued along it for some minutes. He seemed to pass through a hundred\nstages of misery, to pass minute after minute through a hundred degrees\nof cold, damp, and exhaustion. In a little while he ceased to feel his\nhands and feet.\n\nThe gutter sloped downwards. He observed that they were now many feet\nbelow the edge of the buildings. Rows of spectral white shapes like the\nghosts of blind-drawn windows rose above them. They came to the end of\na cable fastened above one of these white windows, dimly visible and\ndropping into impenetrable shadows. Suddenly his hand came against his\nguide's.\n\n\"Still!\" whispered the latter very softly.\n\nHe looked up with a start and saw the huge wings of the flying machine\ngliding slowly and noiselessly overhead athwart the broad band of\nsnow-flecked grey-blue sky. In a moment it was hidden again.\n\n\"Keep still; they were just turning.\"\n\nFor awhile both were motionless, then Graham's companion stood up,\nand reaching towards the fastenings of the cable fumbled with some\nindistinct tackle.\n\n\"What is that?\" asked Graham.\n\nThe only answer was a faint cry. The man crouched motionless. Graham\npeered and saw his face dimly. He was staring down the long ribbon of\nsky, and Graham, following his eyes, saw the flying machine small and\nfaint and remote. Then he saw that the wings spread on either side,\nthat it headed towards them, that every moment it grew larger. It was\nfollowing the edge of the chasm towards them.\n\nThe man's movements became convulsive. He thrust two cross bars into\nGraham's hand. Graham could not see them, he ascertained their form by\nfeeling. They were slung by thin cords to the cable. On the cord were\nhand grips of some soft elastic substance. \"Put the cross between your\nlegs,\" whispered the guide hysterically, \"and grip the holdfasts. Grip\ntightly, grip!\"\n\nGraham did as he was told.\n\n\"Jump,\" said the voice. \"In heaven's name, jump!\"\n\nFor one momentous second Graham could not speak. He was glad afterwards\nthat darkness hid his face. He said nothing. He began to tremble\nviolently. He looked sideways at the swift shadow that swallowed up the\nsky as it rushed upon him.\n\n\"Jump! Jump--in God's name! Or they will have us,\" cried Graham's guide,\nand in the violence of his passion thrust him forward.\n\nGraham tottered convulsively, gave a sobbing cry, a cry in spite of\nhimself, and then, as the flying machine swept over them, fell forward\ninto the pit of that darkness, seated on the cross wood and holding\nthe ropes with the clutch of death. Something cracked, something rapped\nsmartly against a wall. He heard the pulley of the cradle hum on its\nrope. He heard the aeronauts shout. He felt a pair of knees digging into\nhis back.... He was sweeping headlong through the air, falling through\nthe air. All his strength was in his hands. He would have screamed but\nhe had no breath.\n\nHe shot into a blinding light that made him grip the tighter. He\nrecognised the great passage with the running ways, the hanging lights\nand interlacing girders. They rushed upward and by him. He had a\nmomentary impression of a great circular aperture yawning to swallow him\nup.\n\nHe was in the dark again, falling, falling, gripping with aching hands,\nand behold! a clap of sound, a burst of light, and he was in a brightly\nlit hall with a roaring multitude of people beneath his feet. The\npeople! His people! A proscenium, a stage rushed up towards him, and his\ncable swept down to a circular aperture to the right of this. He felt he\nwas travelling slower, and suddenly very much slower. He distinguished\nshouts of \"Saved! The Master. He is safe!\" The stage rushed up towards\nhim with rapidly diminishing swiftness. Then--\n\nHe heard the man clinging behind him shout as if suddenly terrified,\nand this shout was echoed by a shout from below. He felt that he was no\nlonger gliding along the cable but falling with it. There was a tumult\nof yells, screams and cries. He felt something soft against his extended\nhand, and the impact of a broken fall quivering through his arm...\n\nHe wanted to be still and the people were lifting him. He believed\nafterwards he was carried to the platform and given some drink, but he\nwas never sure. He did not notice what became of his guide. When his\nmind was clear again he was on his feet; eager hands were assisting him\nto stand. He was in a big alcove, occupying the position that in his\nprevious experience had been devoted to the lower boxes. If this was\nindeed a theatre.\n\nA mighty tumult was in his ears, a thunderous roar, the shouting of a\ncountless multitude. \"It is the Sleeper! The Sleeper is with us!\"\n\n\"The Sleeper is with us! The Master--the Owner! The Master is with us.\nHe is safe.\"\n\nGraham had a surging vision of a great hall crowded with people. He saw\nno individuals, he was conscious of a froth of pink faces, of waving\narms and garments, he felt the occult influence of a vast crowd pouring\nover him, buoying him up. There were balconies, galleries, great\narchways giving remoter perspectives, and everywhere people, a vast\narena of people, densely packed and cheering. Across the nearer space\nlay the collapsed cable like a huge snake. It had been cut by the men\nof the flying machine at its upper end, and had crumpled down into the\nhall. Men seemed to be hauling this out of the way. But the whole effect\nwas vague, the very buildings throbbed and leapt with the roar of the\nvoices.\n\nHe stood unsteadily and looked at those about him. Someone supported him\nby one arm. \"Let me go into a little room,\" he said, weeping; \"a little\nroom,\" and could say no more. A man in black stepped forward, took his\ndisengaged arm. He was aware of officious men opening a door before\nhim. Someone guided him to a seat. He staggered. He sat down heavily and\ncovered his face with his hands; he was trembling violently, his nervous\ncontrol was at an end. He was relieved of his cloak, he could not\nremember how; his purple hose he saw were black with wet. People were\nrunning about him, things were happening, but for some time he gave no\nheed to them.\n\nHe had escaped. A myriad of cries told him that. He was safe. These were\nthe people who were on his side. For a space he sobbed for breath,\nand then he sat still with his face covered. The air was full of the\nshouting of innumerable men.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. THE PEOPLE MARCH\n\nHe became aware of someone urging a glass of clear fluid upon his\nattention, looked up and discovered this was a dark young man in a\nyellow garment. He took the dose forthwith, and in a moment he was\nglowing. A tall man in a black robe stood by his shoulder, and pointed\nto the half open door into the hall. This man was shouting close to\nhis ear and yet what was said was indistinct because of the tremendous\nuproar from the great theatre. Behind the man was a girl in a silvery\ngrey robe, whom Graham, even in this confusion, perceived to be\nbeautiful. Her dark eyes, full of wonder and curiosity, were fixed on\nhim, her lips trembled apart. A partially opened door gave a glimpse\nof the crowded hall, and admitted a vast uneven tumult, a hammering,\nclapping and shouting that died away and began again, and rose to a\nthunderous pitch, and so continued intermittently all the time that\nGraham remained in the little room. He watched the lips of the man in\nblack and gathered that he was making some clumsy explanation.\n\nHe stared stupidly for some moments at these things and then stood up\nabruptly; he grasped the arm of this shouting person.\n\n\"Tell me!\" he cried. \"Who am I? Who am I?\"\n\nThe others came nearer to hear his words. \"Who am I?\" His eyes searched\ntheir faces.\n\n\"They have told him nothing!\" cried the girl.\n\n\"Tell me, tell me!\" cried Graham.\n\n\"You are the Master of the Earth. You are owner of half the world.\"\n\nHe did not believe he heard aright. He resisted the persuasion. He\npretended not to understand, not to hear. He lifted his voice again. \"I\nhave been awake three days--a prisoner three days. I judge there is some\nstruggle between a number of people in this city--it is London?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the younger man.\n\n\"And those who meet in the great hall with the white Atlas? How does it\nconcern me? In some way it has to do with me. Why, I don't know. Drugs?\nIt seems to me that while I have slept the world has gone mad. I have\ngone mad.\"\n\n\"Who are those Councillors under the Atlas? Why should they try to drug\nme?\"\n\n\"To keep you insensible,\" said the man in yellow.\n\n\"To prevent your interference.\"\n\n\"But _why?_\"\n\n\"Because _you_ are the Atlas, Sire,\" said the man in yellow. \"The world\nis on your shoulders. They rule it in your name.\"\n\nThe sounds from the hall had died into a silence threaded by one\nmonotonous voice. Now suddenly, trampling on these last words, came\na deafening tumult, a roaring and thundering, cheer crowded on cheer,\nvoices hoarse and shrill, beating, overlapping, and while it lasted the\npeople in the little room could not hear each other shout.\n\nGraham stood, his intelligence clinging helplessly to the thing he had\njust heard. \"The Council,\" he repeated blankly, and then snatched at a\nname that had struck him. \"But who is Ostrog?\" he said.\n\n\"He is the organiser--the organiser of the revolt. Our Leader--in your\nname.\"\n\n\"In my name?--And you? Why is he not here?\"\n\n\"He--has deputed us. I am his brother--his half-brother, Lincoln. He\nwants you to show yourself to these people and then come on to him. That\nis why he has sent. He is at the wind-vane offices directing. The people\nare marching.\"\n\n\"In your name,\" shouted the younger man. \"They have ruled, crushed,\ntyrannised. At last even--\"\n\n\"In my name! My name! Master?\"\n\nThe younger man suddenly became audible in a pause of the outer thunder,\nindignant and vociferous, a high penetrating voice under his red\naquiline nose and bushy moustache. \"No one expected you to wake. No one\nexpected you to wake. They were cunning. Damned tyrants! But they were\ntaken by surprise. They did not know whether to drug you, hypnotise you,\nkill you.\"\n\nAgain the hall dominated everything.\n\n\"Ostrog is at the wind-vane offices ready--. Even now there is a rumour\nof fighting beginning.\"\n\n\nThe man who had called himself Lincoln came close to him. \"Ostrog has it\nplanned. Trust him. We have our organisations ready. We shall seize the\nflying stages--. Even now he may be doing that. Then--\"\n\n\"This public theatre,\" bawled the man in yellow, \"is only a contingent.\nWe have five myriads of drilled men--\"\n\n\"We have arms,\" cried Lincoln. \"We have plans. A leader. Their police\nhave gone from the streets and are massed in the--\" (inaudible). \"It\nis now or never. The Council is rocking--They cannot trust even their\ndrilled men--\"\n\n\"Hear the people calling to you!\"\n\nGraham's mind was like a night of moon and swift clouds, now dark and\nhopeless, now clear and ghastly. He was Master of the Earth, he was a\nman sodden with thawing snow. Of all his fluctuating impressions the\ndominant ones presented an antagonism; on the one hand was the White\nCouncil, powerful, disciplined, few, the White Council from which he\nhad just escaped; and on the other, monstrous crowds, packed masses of\nindistinguishable people clamouring his name, hailing him Master.\nThe other side had imprisoned him, debated his death. These shouting\nthousands beyond the little doorway had rescued him. But why these\nthings should be so he could not understand.\n\nThe door opened, Lincoln's voice was swept away and drowned, and a rush\nof people followed on the heels of the tumult. These intruders came\ntowards him and Lincoln gesticulating. The voices without explained\ntheir soundless lips. \"Show us the Sleeper, show us the Sleeper!\" was\nthe burden of the uproar Men were bawling for \"Order! Silence!\"\n\nGraham glanced towards the open doorway, and saw a tall, oblong picture\nof the hall beyond, a waving, incessant confusion of crowded, shouting\nfaces, men and women together, waving pale blue garments, extended\nhands. Many were standing, one man in rags of dark brown, a gaunt\nfigure, stood on the seat and waved a black cloth. He met the wonder and\nexpectation of the girl's eyes. What did these people expect from him.\nHe was dimly aware that the tumult outside had changed its character,\nwas in some way beating, marching. His own mind, too, changed for a\nspace he did not recognise the influence that was transforming him.\nBut a moment that was near to panic passed. He tried to make audible\ninquiries of what was required of him.\n\nLincoln was shouting in his ear, but Graham was deafened to that. All\nthe others save the woman gesticulated towards the hall. He perceived\nwhat had happened to the uproar. The whole mass of people was chanting\ntogether. It was not simply a song, the voices were gathered together\nand upborne by a torrent of instrumental music, music like the music of\nan organ, a woven texture of sounds, full of trumpets, full of flaunting\nbanners, full of the march and pageantry of opening war. And the feet of\nthe people were beating time--tramp, tramp.\n\nHe was urged towards the door. He obeyed mechanically. The strength\nof that chant took hold of him, stirred him, emboldened him. The hall\nopened to him, a vast welter of fluttering colour swaying to the music.\n\n\"Wave your arm to them,\" said Lincoln. \"Wave your arm to them.\"\n\n\"This,\" said a voice on the other side, \"he must have this.\" Arms were\nabout his neck detaining him in the doorway, and a black subtly-folding\nmantle hung from his shoulders. He threw his arm free of this and\nfollowed Lincoln. He perceived the girl in grey close to him, her face\nlit, her gesture onward. For the instant she became to him, flushed and\neager as she was, an embodiment of the song. He emerged in the alcove\nagain. Incontinently the mounting waves of the song broke upon his\nappearing, and flashed up into a foam of shouting. Guided by Lincoln's\nhand he marched obliquely across the centre of the stage facing the\npeople.\n\nThe hall was a vast and intricate space--galleries, balconies, broad\nspaces of amphitheatral steps, and great archways. Far away, high up,\nseemed the mouth of a huge passage full of struggling humanity. The\nwhole multitude was swaying in congested masses. Individual figures\nsprang out of the tumult, impressed him momentarily, and lost definition\nagain. Close to the platform swayed a beautiful fair woman, carried by\nthree men, her hair across her face and brandishing a green staff. Next\nthis group an old careworn man in blue canvas maintained his place in\nthe crush with difficulty, and behind shouted a hairless face, a\ngreat cavity of toothless mouth. A voice called that enigmatical word\n\"Ostrog.\" All his impressions were vague save the massive emotion\nof that trampling song. The multitude were beating time with their\nfeet--marking time, tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp. The green weapons waved,\nflashed and slanted. Then he saw those nearest to him on a level space\nbefore the stage were marching in front of him, passing towards a great\narchway, shouting \"To the Council!\" Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp. He\nraised his arm, and the roaring was redoubled. He remembered he had to\nshout \"March!\" His mouth shaped inaudible heroic words. He waved his arm\nagain and pointed to the archway, shouting \"Onward!\" They were no longer\nmarking time, they were marching; tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp. In that\nhost were bearded men, old men, youths, fluttering robed bare-armed\nwomen, girls. Men and women of the new age! Rich robes, grey rags\nfluttered together in the whirl of their movement amidst the dominant\nblue. A monstrous black banner jerked its way to the right. He perceived\na blue-clad negro, a shrivelled woman in yellow, then a group of tall\nfair-haired, white-faced, blue-clad men pushed theatrically past him.\nHe noted two Chinamen. A tall, sallow, dark-haired, shining-eyed youth,\nwhite clad from top to toe, clambered up towards the platform shouting\nloyally, and sprang down again and receded, looking backward. Heads,\nshoulders, hands clutching weapons, all were swinging with those\nmarching cadences.\n\nFaces came out of the confusion to him as he stood there, eyes met his\nand passed and vanished. Men gesticulated to him, shouted inaudible\npersonal things. Most of the faces were flushed, but many were ghastly\nwhite. And disease was there, and many a hand that waved to him was\ngaunt and lean. Men and women of the new age! Strange and incredible\nmeeting! As the broad stream passed before him to the right, tributary\ngangways from the remote uplands of the hall thrust downward in an\nincessant replacement of people; tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp. The unison\nof the song was enriched and complicated by the massive echoes of arches\nand passages. Men and women mingled in the ranks; tramp, tramp, tramp,\ntramp. The whole world seemed marching. Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp; his\nbrain was tramping. The garments waved onward, the faces poured by more\nabundantly.\n\n\nTramp, tramp, tramp, tramp; at Lincoln's pressure he turned towards the\narchway, walking unconsciously in that rhythm, scarcely noticing his\nmovement for the melody and stir of it. The multitude, the gesture and\nsong, all moved in that direction, the flow of people smote downward\nuntil the upturned faces were below the level of his feet. He was aware\nof a path before him, of a suite about him, of guards and dignities, and\nLincoln on his right hand. Attendants intervened, and ever and again\nblotted out the sight of the multitude to the left. Before him went the\nbacks of the guards in black--three and three and three. He was marched\nalong a little railed way, and crossed above the archway, with the\ntorrent dipping to flow beneath, and shouting up to him. He did not\nknow whither he went; he did not want to know. He glanced back across a\nflaming spaciousness of hall. Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. THE BATTLE OF THE DARKNESS\n\nHe was no longer in the hall. He was marching along a gallery\noverhanging one of the great streets of the moving platforms that\ntraversed the city. Before him and behind him tramped his guards. The\nwhole concave of the moving ways below was a congested mass of people\nmarching, tramping to the left, shouting, waving hands and arms, pouring\nalong a huge vista, shouting as they came into view, shouting as they\npassed, shouting as they receded, until the globes of electric light\nreceding in perspective dropped down it seemed and hid the swarming bare\nheads. Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp.\n\nThe song roared up to Graham now, no longer upborne by music, but coarse\nand noisy, and the beating of the marching feet, tramp, tramp, tramp,\ntramp, interwove with a thunderous irregularity of footsteps from the\nundisciplined rabble that poured along the higher ways.\n\nAbruptly he noted a contrast. The buildings on the opposite side of the\nway seemed deserted, the cables and bridges that laced across the aisle\nwere empty and shadowy. It came into Graham's mind that these also\nshould have swarmed with people.\n\nHe felt a curious emotion--throbbing--very fast! He stopped again. The\nguards before him marched on; those about him stopped as he did. He saw\nthe direction of their faces. The throbbing had something to do with the\nlights. He too looked up.\n\nAt first it seemed to him a thing that affected the lights simply, an\nisolated phenomenon, having no bearing on the things below. Each huge\nglobe of blinding whiteness was as it were clutched, compressed in a\nsystole that was followed by a transitory diastole, and again a systole\nlike a tightening grip, darkness, light, darkness, in rapid alternation.\n\nGraham became aware that this strange behaviour of the lights had to\ndo with the people below. The appearance of the houses and ways, the\nappearance of the packed masses changed, became a confusion of vivid\nlights and leaping shadows. He saw a multitude of shadows had sprung\ninto aggressive existence, seemed rushing up, broadening, widening,\ngrowing with steady swiftness--to leap suddenly back and return\nreinforced. The song and the tramping had ceased. The unanimous march,\nhe discovered, was arrested, there were eddies, a flow sideways, shouts\nof \"The lights!\" Voices were crying together one thing. \"The lights!\"\ncried these voices. \"The lights!\" He looked down. In this dancing death\nof the lights the area of the street had suddenly become a monstrous\nstruggle. The huge white globes became purple-white, purple with a\nreddish glow, flickered, flickered faster and faster, fluttered between\nlight and extinction, ceased to flicker and became mere fading specks\nof glowing red in a vast obscurity. In ten seconds the extinction\nwas accomplished, and there was only this roaring darkness, a black\nmonstrosity that had suddenly swallowed up those glittering myriads of\nmen.\n\nHe felt invisible forms about him; his arms were gripped. Something\nrapped sharply against his shin. A voice bawled in his ear, \"It is all\nright--all right.\"\n\nGraham shook off the paralysis of his first astonishment. He struck his\nforehead against Lincoln's and bawled, \"What is this darkness?\"\n\n\"The Council has cut the currents that light the city. We must\nwait--stop. The people will go on. They will--\"\n\nHis voice was drowned. Voices were shouting, \"Save the Sleeper. Take\ncare of the Sleeper.\" A guard stumbled against Graham and hurt his hand\nby an inadvertent blow of his weapon. A wild tumult tossed and whirled\nabout him, growing, as it seemed, louder, denser, more furious each\nmoment. Fragments of recognisable sounds drove towards him, were whirled\naway from him as his mind reached out to grasp them. Voices seemed to be\nshouting conflicting orders, other voices answered. There were suddenly\na succession of piercing screams close beneath them.\n\nA voice bawled in his ear, \"The red police,\" and receded forthwith\nbeyond his questions.\n\nA crackling sound grew to distinctness, and there with a leaping of\nfaint flashes along the edge of the further ways. By their light Graham\nsaw the heads and bodies of a number of men, armed with weapons like\nthose of his guards, leap into an instant's dim visibility. The whole\narea began to crackle, to flash with little instantaneous streaks of\nlight, and abruptly the darkness rolled back like a curtain.\n\nA glare of light dazzled his eyes, a vast seething expanse of struggling\nmen confused his mind. A shout, a burst of cheering, came across the\nways. He looked up to see the source of the light. A man hung far\noverhead from the upper part of a cable, holding by a rope the blinding\nstar that had driven the darkness back. He wore a red uniform.\n\nGraham's eyes fell to the ways again. A wedge of red a little way along\nthe vista caught his eye. He saw it was a dense mass of red-clad men\njammed the higher further way, their backs against the pitiless cliff\nof building, and surrounded by a dense crowd of antagonists. They were\nfighting. Weapons flashed and rose and fell, heads vanished at the edge\nof the contest, and other heads replaced them, the little flashes from\nthe green weapons became little jets of smoky grey while the light\nlasted.\n\nAbruptly the flare was extinguished and the ways were an inky darkness\nonce more, a tumultuous mystery.\n\nHe felt something thrusting against him. He was being pushed along the\ngallery. Someone was shouting--it might be at him. He was too confused\nto hear. He was thrust against the wall, and a number of people\nblundered past him. It seemed to him that his guards were struggling\nwith one another.\n\nSuddenly the cable-hung star-holder appeared again, and the whole scene\nwas white and dazzling. The band of red-coats seemed broader and nearer;\nits apex was half-way down the ways towards the central aisle. And\nraising his eyes Graham saw that a number of these men had also appeared\nnow in the darkened lower galleries of the opposite building, and were\nfiring over the heads of their fellows below at the boiling confusion of\npeople on the lower ways. The meaning of these things dawned upon him.\nThe march of the people had come upon an ambush at the very outset.\nThrown into confusion by the extinction of the lights they were now\nbeing attacked by the red police. Then he became aware that he was\nstanding alone, that his guards and Lincoln were along the gallery in\nthe direction along which he had come before the darkness fell. He saw\nthey were gesticulating to him wildly, running back towards him. A great\nshouting came from across the ways. Then it seemed as though the whole\nface of the darkened building opposite was lined and speckled with\nred-clad men. And they were pointing over to him and shouting. \"The\nSleeper! Save the Sleeper!\" shouted a multitude of throats.\n\nSomething struck the wall above his head. He looked up at the impact and\nsaw a star-shaped splash of silvery metal. He saw Lincoln near him. Felt\nhis arm gripped. Then, pat, pat; he had been missed twice.\n\nFor a moment he did not understand this. The street was hidden,\neverything was hidden, as he looked. The second flare had burned out.\n\nLincoln had gripped Graham by the arm, was lugging him along the\ngallery. \"Before the next light!\" he cried. His haste was contagious.\nGraham's instinct of self-preservation overcame the paralysis of his\nincredulous astonishment. He became for a time the blind creature of\nthe fear of death. He ran, stumbling because of the uncertainty of the\ndarkness, blundered into his guards as they turned to run with him.\nHaste was his one desire, to escape this perilous gallery upon which he\nwas exposed. A third glare came close on its predecessors. With it came\na great shouting across the ways, an answering tumult from the ways.\nThe red-coats below, he saw, had now almost gained the central passage.\nTheir countless faces turned towards him, and they shouted. The white\nfacade opposite was densely stippled with red. All these wonderful\nthings concerned him, turned upon him as a pivot. These were the guards\nof the Council attempting to recapture him.\n\nLucky it was for him that these shots were the first fired in anger for\na hundred and fifty years. He heard bullets whacking over his head, felt\na splash of molten metal sting his ear, and perceived without looking\nthat the whole opposite facade, an unmasked ambuscade of red police, was\ncrowded and bawling and firing at him.\n\nDown went one of his guards before him, and Graham, unable to stop,\nleapt the writhing body.\n\nIn another second he had plunged, unhurt, into a black passage, and\nincontinently someone, coming, it may be, in a transverse direction,\nblundered violently into him. He was hurling down a staircase in\nabsolute darkness. He reeled, and was struck again, and came against a\nwall with his hands. He was crushed by a weight of struggling bodies,\nwhirled round, and thrust to the right. A vast pressure pinned him.\nHe could not breathe, his ribs seemed cracking. He felt a momentary\nrelaxation, and then the whole mass of people moving together, bore him\nback towards the great theatre from which he had so recently come.\n\nThere were moments when his feet did not touch the ground. Then he was\nstaggering and shoving. He heard shouts of \"They are coming!\" and a\nmuffled cry close to him. His foot blundered against something soft, he\nheard a hoarse scream under foot. He heard shouts of \"The Sleeper!\" but\nhe was too confused to speak. He heard the green weapons crackling. For\na space he lost his individual will, became an atom in a panic, blind,\nunthinking, mechanical. He thrust and pressed back and writhed in the\npressure, kicked presently against a step, and found himself ascending\na slope. And abruptly the faces all about him leapt out of the black,\nvisible, ghastly-white and astonished, terrified, perspiring, in a livid\nglare. One face, a young man's, was very near to him, not twenty inches\naway. At the time it was but a passing incident of no emotional value,\nbut afterwards it came back to him in his dreams. For this young man,\nwedged upright in the crowd for a time, had been shot and was already\ndead.\n\nA fourth white star must have been lit by the man on the cable. Its\nlight came glaring in through vast windows and arches and showed Graham\nthat he was now one of a dense mass of flying black figures pressed back\nacross the lower area of the great theatre. This time the picture was\nlivid and fragmentary slashed and barred with black shadows. He saw that\nquite near to him the red guards were fighting their way through the\npeople. He could not tell whether they saw him. He looked for Lincoln\nand his guards. He saw Lincoln near the stage of the theatre surrounded\nin a crowd of black-badged revolutionaries, lifted up and staring to\nand fro as if seeking him. Graham perceived that he himself was near\nthe opposite edge of the crowd, that behind him, separated by a barrier,\nsloped the now vacant seats of the theatre. A sudden idea came to him,\nand he began fighting his way towards the barrier. As he reached it the\nglare came to an end.\n\nIn a moment he had thrown off the great cloak that not only impeded\nhis movements but made him conspicuous, and had slipped it from his\nshoulders. He heard someone trip in its folds. In another he was scaling\nthe barrier and had dropped into the blackness on the further side. Then\nfeeling his way he came to the lower end of an ascending gangway. In\nthe darkness the sound of firing ceased and the roar of feet and voices\nlulled. Then suddenly he came to an unexpected step and tripped and\nfell. As he did so pools and islands amidst the darkness about him leapt\nto vivid light again, the uproar surged louder and the glare of the\nfifth white star shone through the vast fenestrations of the theatre\nwalls.\n\nHe rolled over among some seats, heard a shouting and the whirring\nrattle of weapons, struggled up and was knocked back again, perceived\nthat a number of black-badged men were all about him firing at the\nrebels below, leaping from seat to seat, crouching among the seats\nto reload. Instinctively he crouched amidst the seats, as stray shots\nripped the pneumatic cushions and cut bright slashes on their soft metal\nframes. Instinctively he marked the direction of the gangways, the most\nplausible way of escape for him so soon as the veil of darkness fell\nagain.\n\nA young man in faded blue garments came vaulting over the seats.\n\"Hullo!\" he said, with his flying feet within six inches of the\ncrouching Sleeper's face.\n\nHe stared without any sign of recognition, turned to fire, fired, and,\nshouting, \"To hell with the Council!\" was about to fire again. Then it\nseemed to Graham that the half of this man's neck had vanished. A\ndrop of moisture fell on Graham's cheek. The green weapon stopped\nhalf raised. For a moment the man stood still with his face suddenly\nexpressionless, then he began to slant forward. His knees bent. Man and\ndarkness fell together. At the sound of his fall Graham rose up and ran\nfor his life until a step down to the gangway tripped him. He scrambled\nto his feet, turned up the gangway and ran on.\n\nWhen the sixth star glared he was already close to the yawning throat of\na passage. He ran on the swifter for the light, entered the passage\nand turned a corner into absolute night again. He was knocked sideways,\nrolled over, and recovered his feet. He found himself one of a crowd of\ninvisible fugitives pressing in one direction. His one thought now\nwas their thought also; to escape out of this fighting. He thrust and\nstruck, staggered, ran, was wedged tightly, lost ground and then was\nclear again.\n\nFor some minutes he was running through the darkness along a winding\npassage, and then he crossed some wide and open space, passed down a\nlong incline, and came at last down a flight of steps to a level place.\nMany people were shouting, \"They are coming! The guards are coming. They\nare firing. Get out of the fighting. The guards are firing. It will be\nsafe in Seventh Way. Along here to Seventh Way!\" There were women and\nchildren in the crowd as well as men. Men called names to him. The crowd\nconverged on an archway, passed through a short throat and emerged on a\nwider space again, lit dimly. The black figures about him spread out and\nran up what seemed in the twilight to be a gigantic series of steps. He\nfollowed. The people dispersed to the right and left.... He perceived\nthat he was no longer in a crowd. He stopped near the highest step.\nBefore him, on that level, were groups of seats and a little kiosk. He\nwent up to this and, stopping in the shadow of its eaves, looked about\nhim panting.\n\nEverything was vague and gray, but he recognised that these great steps\nwere a series of platforms of the \"ways,\" now motionless again. The\nplatform slanted up on either side, and the tall buildings rose beyond,\nvast dim ghosts, their inscriptions and advertisements indistinctly\nseen, and up through the girders and cables was a faint interrupted\nribbon of pallid sky. A number of people hurried by. From their shouts\nand voices, it seemed they were hurrying to join the fighting. Other\nless noisy figures flitted timidly among the shadows.\n\nFrom very far away down the street he could hear the sound of a\nstruggle. But it was evident to him that this was not the street into\nwhich the theatre opened. That former fight, it seemed, had suddenly\ndropped out of sound and hearing. And--grotesque thought!--they were\nfighting for him!\n\nFor a space he was like a man who pauses in the reading of a vivid book,\nand suddenly doubts what he has been taking unquestioningly. At that\ntime he had little mind for details; the whole effect was a huge\nastonishment. Oddly enough, while the flight from the Council prison,\nthe great crowd in the hall, and the attack of the red police upon the\nswarming people were clearly present in his mind, it cost him an effort\nto piece in his awakening and to revive the meditative interval of the\nSilent Rooms. At first his memory leapt these things and took him back\nto the cascade at Pentargen quivering in the wind, and all the sombre\nsplendours of the sunlit Cornish coast. The contrast touched everything\nwith unreality. And then the gap filled, and he began to comprehend his\nposition.\n\nIt was no longer absolutely a riddle, as it had been in the Silent\nRooms. At least he had the strange, bare outline now. He was in some way\nthe owner of half the world, and great political parties were fighting\nto possess him. On the one hand was the White Council, with its red\npolice, set resolutely, it seemed, on the usurpation of his property and\nperhaps his murder; on the other, the revolution that had liberated him,\nwith this unseen \"Ostrog\" as its leader. And the whole of this gigantic\ncity was convulsed by their struggle. Frantic development of his\nworld! \"I do not understand,\" he cried. \"I do not understand!\"\n\nHe had slipped out between the contending parties into this liberty of\nthe twilight. What would happen next? What was happening? He figured\nthe redclad men as busily hunting him, driving the blackbadged\nrevolutionists before them.\n\nAt any rate chance had given him a breathing space. He could lurk\nunchallenged by the passers-by, and watch the course of things. His eye\nfollowed up the intricate dim immensity of the twilight buildings, and\nit came to him as a thing infinitely wonderful, that above there the\nsun was rising, and the world was lit and glowing with the old familiar\nlight of day. In a little while he had recovered his breath. His\nclothing had already dried upon him from the snow.\n\nHe wandered for miles along these twilight ways, speaking to no one,\naccosted by no one--a dark figure among dark figures--the coveted man\nout of the past, the inestimable unintentional owner of half the world.\nWherever there were lights or dense crowds, or exceptional excitement\nhe was afraid of recognition, and watched and turned back or went up and\ndown by the middle stairways, into some transverse system of ways at a\nlower or higher level. And though he came on no more fighting, the\nwhole city stirred with battle. Once he had to run to avoid a marching\nmultitude of men that swept the street. Everyone abroad seemed involved.\nFor the most part they were men, and they carried what he judged were\nweapons. It seemed as though the struggle was concentrated mainly in\nthe quarter of the city from which he came. Ever and again a distant\nroaring, the remote suggestion of that conflict, reached his ears.\nThen his caution and his curiosity struggled together. But his caution\nprevailed, and he continued wandering away from the fighting--so far as\nhe could judge. He went unmolested, unsuspected through the dark. After\na time he ceased to hear even a remote echo of the battle, fewer and\nfewer people passed him, until at last the Titanic streets became\ndeserted. The frontages of the buildings grew plain and harsh; he seemed\nto have come to a district of vacant warehouses. Solitude crept upon\nhim--his pace slackened.\n\nHe became aware of a growing fatigue. At times he would turn aside\nand seat himself on one of the numerous seats of the upper ways. But\na feverish restlessness, the knowledge of his vital implication in his\nstruggle, would not let him rest in any place for long. Was the struggle\non his behalf alone?\n\nAnd then in a desolate place came the shock of an earthquake--a roaring\nand thundering--a mighty wind of cold air pouring through the city,\nthe smash of glass, the slip and thud of falling masonry--a series of\ngigantic concussions. A mass of glass and ironwork fell from the remote\nroofs into the middle gallery, not a hundred yards away from him, and\nin the distance were shouts and running. He, too, was startled to an\naimless activity, and ran first one way and then as aimlessly back.\n\nA man came running towards him. His self-control returned. \"What have\nthey blown up?\" asked the man breathlessly. \"That was an explosion,\" and\nbefore Graham could speak he had hurried on.\n\nThe great buildings rose dimly, veiled by a perplexing twilight, albeit\nthe rivulet of sky above was now bright with day. He noted many strange\nfeatures, understanding none at the time; he even spelt out many of the\ninscriptions in Phonetic lettering. But what profits it to decipher a\nconfusion of odd-looking letters resolving itself, after painful strain\nof eye and mind, into \"Here is Eadhamite,\" or, \"Labour Bureau--Little\nSide?\" Grotesque thought, that in all probability some or all of these\ncliff-like houses were his!\n\nThe perversity of his experience came to him vividly. In actual fact he\nhad made such a leap in time as romancers have imagined again and again.\nAnd that fact realised, he had been prepared, his mind had, as it were,\nseated itself for a spectacle. And no spectacle, but a great vague\ndanger, unsympathetic shadows and veils of darkness. Somewhere through\nthe labyrinthine obscurity his death sought him. Would he, after all, be\nkilled before he saw? It might be that even at the next shadowy corner\nhis destruction ambushed. A great desire to see, a great longing to\nknow, arose in him.\n\nHe became fearful of corners. It seemed to him that there was safety\nin concealment. Where could he hide to be inconspicuous when the lights\nreturned? At last he sat down upon a seat in a recess on one of the\nhigher ways, conceiving he was alone there.\n\nHe squeezed his knuckles into his weary eyes. Suppose when he looked\nagain he found the dark through of parallel ways and that intolerable\naltitude of edifice, gone? Suppose he were to discover the whole story\nof these last few days, the awakening, the shouting multitudes, the\ndarkness and the fighting, a phantasmagoria, a new and more vivid sort\nof dream. It must be a dream; it was so inconsecutive, so reasonless.\nWhy were the people fighting for him? Why should this saner world regard\nhim as Owner and Master?\n\nSo he thought, sitting blinded, and then he looked again, half hoping\nin spite of his ears to see some familiar aspect of the life of the\nnineteenth century, to see, perhaps, the little harbour of Boscastle\nabout him, the cliffs of Pentargen, or the bedroom of his home. But fact\ntakes no heed of human hopes. A squad of men with a black banner tramped\nathwart the nearer shadows, intent on conflict, and beyond rose that\ngiddy wall of frontage, vast and dark, with the dim incomprehensible\nlettering showing faintly on its face.\n\n\"It is no dream,\" he said, \"no dream.\" And he bowed his face upon his\nhands.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. THE OLD MAN WHO KNEW EVERYTHING\n\nHe was startled by a cough close at hand.\n\nHe turned sharply, and peering, saw a small, hunched-up figure sitting a\ncouple of yards off in the shadow of the enclosure.\n\n\"Have ye any news?\" asked the high-pitched wheezy voice of a very old\nman.\n\nGraham hesitated. \"None,\" he said.\n\n\"I stay here till the lights come again,\" said the old man. \"These blue\nscoundrels are everywhere--everywhere.\"\n\nGraham's answer was inarticulate assent. He tried to see the old man but\nthe darkness hid his face. He wanted very much to respond, to talk, but\nhe did not know how to begin.\n\n\"Dark and damnable,\" said the old man suddenly. \"Dark and damnable.\nTurned out of my room among all these dangers.\"\n\n\"That's hard,\" ventured Graham. \"That's hard on you.\"\n\n\"Darkness. An old man lost in the darkness. And all the world gone mad.\nWar and fighting. The police beaten and rogues abroad. Why don't they\nbring some negroes to protect us?... No more dark passages for me. I\nfell over a dead man.\"\n\n\"You're safer with company,\" said the old man, \"if it's company of\nthe right sort,\" and peered frankly. He rose suddenly and came towards\nGraham.\n\nApparently the scrutiny was satisfactory. The old man sat down as if\nrelieved to be no longer alone. \"Eh!\" he said, \"but this is a terrible\ntime! War and fighting, and the dead lying there--men, strong men, dying\nin the dark. Sons! I have three sons. God knows where they are tonight.\"\n\nThe voice ceased. Then repeated quavering: \"God knows where they are\ntonight.\"\n\nGraham stood revolving a question that should not betray his ignorance.\nAgain the old man's voice ended the pause.\n\n\"This Ostrog will win,\" he said. \"He will win. And what the world will\nbe like under him no one can tell. My sons are under the wind-vanes,\nall three. One of my daughters-in-law was his mistress for a while.\nHis mistress! We're not common people. Though they've sent me to wander\ntonight and take my chance.... I knew what was going on. Before most\npeople. But this darkness! And to fall over a dead body suddenly in the\ndark!\"\n\nHis wheezy breathing could be heard.\n\n\"Ostrog!\" said Graham.\n\n\"The greatest Boss the world has ever seen,\" said the voice.\n\nGraham ransacked his mind. \"The Council has few friends among the\npeople,\" he hazarded.\n\n\"Few friends. And poor ones at that. They've had their time. Eh! They\nshould have kept to the clever ones. But twice they held election. And\nOstrog. And now it has burst out and nothing can stay it, nothing can\nstay it. Twice they rejected Ostrog--Ostrog the Boss. I heard of his\nrages at the time--he was terrible. Heaven save them! For nothing on\nearth can now, he has raised the Labour Companies upon them. No one else\nwould have dared. All the blue canvas armed and marching! He will go\nthrough with it. He will go through.\"\n\nHe was silent for a little while. \"This Sleeper,\" he said, and stopped.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Graham. \"Well?\"\n\nThe senile voice sank to a confidential whisper, the dim, pale face came\nclose. \"The real Sleeper--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Graham.\n\n\"Died years ago.\"\n\n\"What?\" said Graham, sharply.\n\n\"Years ago. Died. Years ago.\"\n\n\"You don't say so!\" said Graham.\n\n\"I do. I do say so. He died. This Sleeper who's woke up--they changed in\nthe night. A poor, drugged insensible creature. But I mustn't tell all I\nknow. I mustn't tell all I know.\"\n\nFor a little while he muttered inaudibly. His secret was too much for\nhim. \"I don't know the ones that put him to sleep--that was before my\ntime--but I know the man who injected the stimulants and woke him again.\nIt was ten to one--wake or kill. Wake or kill. Ostrog's way.\"\n\nGraham was so astonished at these things that he had to interrupt, to\nmake the old man repeat his words, to re-question vaguely, before he was\nsure of the meaning and folly of what he heard. And his awakening had\nnot been natural! Was that an old man's senile superstition, too, or\nhad it any truth in it? Feeling in the dark corners of his memory, he\npresently came on something that might conceivably be an impression of\nsome such stimulating effect. It dawned upon him that he had happened\nupon a lucky encounter, that at last he might learn something of the\nnew age. The old man wheezed a while and spat, and then the piping,\nreminiscent voice resumed:\n\n\"The first time they rejected him. I've followed it all.\"\n\n\"Rejected whom?\" said Graham. \"The Sleeper?\"\n\n\"Sleeper? No. Ostrog. He was terrible--terrible! And he was promised\nthen, promised certainly the next time. Fools they were--not to be more\nafraid of him. Now all the city's his millstone, and such as we dust\nground upon it. Dust ground upon it. Until he set to work--the workers\ncut each other's throats, and murdered a Chinaman or a Labour policeman\nat times, and left the rest of us in peace. Dead bodies! Robbing!\nDarkness! Such a thing hasn't been this gross of years. Eh!--but 'tis\nill on small folks when the great fall out! It's ill.\"\n\n\"Did you say--there had not been what?--for a gross of years?\"\n\n\"Eh?\" said the old man.\n\nThe old man said something about clipping his words, and made him repeat\nthis a third time. \"Fighting and slaying, and weapons in hand, and fools\nbawling freedom and the like,\" said the old man. \"Not in all my life has\nthere been that. These are like the old days--for sure--when the Paris\npeople broke out--three gross of years ago. That's what I mean hasn't\nbeen. But it's the world's way. It had to come back. I know. I know.\nThis five years Ostrog has been working, and there has been trouble and\ntrouble, and hunger and threats and high talk and arms. Blue canvas and\nmurmurs. No one safe. Everything sliding and slipping. And now here we\nare! Revolt and fighting, and the Council come to its end.\"\n\n\"You are rather well-informed on these things,\" said Graham.\n\n\"I know what I hear. It isn't all Babble Machine with me.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Graham, wondering what Babble Machine might be. \"And you are\ncertain this Ostrog--you are certain Ostrog organised this rebellion and\narranged for the waking of the Sleeper? Just to assert himself--because\nhe was not elected to the Council?\n\n\"Everyone knows that, I should think,\" said the old man. \"Except--just\nfools. He meant to be master somehow. In the Council or not. Everyone\nwho knows anything knows that. And here we are with dead bodies lying\nin the dark! Why, where have you been if you haven't heard all about\nthe trouble between Ostrog and the Verneys? And what do you think the\ntroubles are about? The Sleeper? Eh? You think the Sleeper's real and\nwoke of his own accord--eh?\"\n\n\"I'm a dull man, older than I look, and forgetful,\" said Graham. \"Lots\nof things that have happened--especially of late years--. If I was the\nSleeper, to tell you the truth, I couldn't know less about them.\"\n\n\"Eh!\" said the voice. \"Old, are you? You don't sound so very old! But\nits not everyone keeps his memory to my time of life--truly. But these\nnotorious things! But you're not so old as me--not nearly so old as me.\nWell! I ought not to judge other men by myself, perhaps. I'm young--for\nso old a man. Maybe you're old for so young.\"\n\n\"That's it,\" said Graham. \"And I've a queer history. I know very little.\nAnd history! Practically I know no history. The Sleeper and Julius\nCaesar are all the same to me. It's interesting to hear you talk of\nthese things.\"\n\n\"I know a few things,\" said the old man. \"I know a thing or two. But--.\nHark!\"\n\nThe two men became silent, listening. There was heavy thud, a concussion\nthat made their seat shiver. The passers-by stopped, shouted to one\nanother. The old man was full of questions; he shouted to a man who\npassed near. Graham, emboldened by his example, got up and accosted\nothers. None knew what had happened.\n\nHe returned to the seat and found the old man muttering vague\ninterrogations in an undertone. For a while they said nothing to one\nanother.\n\nThe sense of this gigantic struggle, so near and yet so remote oppressed\nGraham's imagination. Was this old man right, was the report of the\npeople right, and were the revolutionaries winning? Or were they all in\nerror, and were the red guards driving all before them? At any time the\nflood of warfare might pour into this silent quarter of the city and\nseize upon him again. It behooved him to learn all he could while there\nwas time. He turned suddenly to the old man with a question and left it\nunsaid. But his motion moved the old man to speech again.\n\n\"Eh! but how things work together!\" said the old man. \"This Sleeper that\nall the fools put their trust in! I've the whole history of it--I was\nalways a good one for histories. When I was a boy--I'm that old--I\nused to read printed books. You'd hardly think it. Likely you've seen\nnone--they rot and dust so--and the Sanitary Company burns them to make\nashlarite. But they were convenient in their dirty way. Oh I learnt a\nlot. These new-fangled Babble Machines--they don't seem new-fangled to\nyou, eh?--they're easy to hear, easy to forget. But I've traced all the\nSleeper business from the first.\"\n\n\n\"You will scarcely believe it,\" said Graham slowly, \"I'm so\nignorant--I've been so preoccupied in my own little affairs, my\ncircumstances have been so odd--I know nothing of this Sleeper's\nhistory. Who was he?\"\n\n\"Eh!\" said the old man. \"I know. I know. He was a poor nobody, and set\non a playful woman, poor soul! And he fell into a trance. There's the\nold things they had, those brown things--silver photographs--still\nshowing him as he lay, a gross and a half years ago--a gross and a half\nof years.\"\n\n\"Set on a playful woman, poor soul,\" said Graham softly to himself, and\nthen aloud, \"Yes--well! go on.\"\n\n\"You must know he had a cousin named Warming a solitary man without\nchildren, who made a big fortune speculating in roads--the first\nEadhamite roads. But surely you've heard? No? Why? He bought all the\npatent rights and made a big company. In those days there were grosses\nof grosses of separate businesses and business companies. Grosses of\ngrosses! His roads killed the railroads--the old things--in two dozen\nyears; he bought up and Eadhamited the tracks. And because he didn't\nwant to break up his great property or let in shareholders, he left it\nall to the Sleeper, and put it under a Board of Trustees that he had\npicked and trained. He knew then the Sleeper wouldn't wake, that he\nwould go on sleeping, sleeping till he died. He knew that quite well!\nAnd plump! a man in the United States, who had lost two sons in a boat\naccident, followed that up with another great bequest. His trustees\nfound themselves with a dozen myriads of lions'-worth or more of\nproperty at the very beginning.\"\n\n\"What was his name?\"\n\n\"Graham.\"\n\n\"No, I mean--that American's.\"\n\n\"Isbister.\"\n\n\"Isbister!\" cried Graham. \"Why, I don't even know the name.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" said the old man. \"Of course not. People don't learn\nmuch in the schools nowadays. But I know all about him. He was a rich\nAmerican who went from England, and he left the Sleeper even more than\nWarming. How he made it? That I don't know. Something about pictures by\nmachinery. But he made it and left it, and so the Council had its start.\nIt was just a council of trustees at first.\"\n\n\"And how did it grow?\"\n\n\"Eh!--but you're not up to things. Money attracts money--and twelve\nbrains are better than one. They played it cleverly. They worked\npolitics with money, and kept on adding to the money by working currency\nand tariffs. They grew--they grew. And for years the twelve trustees\nhid the growing of the Sleeper's estate, under double names and company\ntitles and all that. The Council spread by title deed, mortgage, share,\nevery political party, every newspaper, they bought. If you listen to\nthe old stories you will see the Council growing and growing. Billions\nand billions of lions at last--the Sleeper's estate. And all growing\nout of a whim--out of this Warming's will, and an accident to Isbister's\nsons.\n\n\"Men are strange,\" said the old man. \"The strange, thing to me is how\nthe Council worked together so long. As many as twelve. But they worked\nin cliques from the first. And they've slipped back. In my young days\nspeaking of the Council was like an ignorant man speaking of God. We\ndidn't think they could do wrong. We didn't know of their women and all\nthat! Or else I've got wiser.\n\n\"Men are strange,\" said the old man. \"Here are you, young and\nignorant, and me--sevendy years old, and I might reasonably be\nforgetting--explaining it all to you short and clear.\n\n\"Sevendy,\" he said, \"sevendy, and I hear and see--hear better than I\nsee. And reason clearly, and keep myself up to all the happenings of\nthings. Sevendy!\n\n\"Life is strange. I was twaindy before Ostrog was a baby. I remember him\nlong before he'd pushed his way to the head of the Wind Vanes Control.\nI've seen many changes. Eh! I've worn the blue. And at last I've come to\nsee this crush and darkness and tumult and dead men carried by in heaps\non the ways. And all his doing! All his doing!\"\n\nHis voice died away in scarcely articulate praises of Ostrog.\n\nGraham thought. \"Let me see,\" he said, \"if I have it right.\"\n\nHe extended a hand and ticked off points upon his fingers. \"The Sleeper\nhas been asleep--\"\n\n\"Changed,\" said the old man.\n\n\"Perhaps. And meanwhile the Sleeper's property grew in the hands of\nTwelve Trustees, until it swallowed up nearly all the great ownership of\nthe world. The Twelve Trustees--by virtue of this property have become\nvirtually masters of the world. Because they are the paying power--just\nas the old English Parliament used to be--\"\n\n\"Eh!\" said the old man. \"That's so--that's a good comparison. You're not\nso--\"\n\n\"And now this Ostrog--has suddenly revolutionised the world by waking\nthe Sleeper--whom no one but the superstitious, common people had ever\ndreamt would wake again--raising the Sleeper to claim his property from\nthe Council, after all these years.\"\n\nThe old man endorsed this statement with a cough. \"It's strange,\"\nhe said, \"to meet a man who learns these things for the first time\ntonight.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said Graham, \"it's strange.\"\n\n\"Have you been in a Pleasure City?\" said the old man. \"All my life I've\nlonged--\" He laughed. \"Even now,\" he said, \"I could enjoy a little\nfun. Enjoy seeing things, anyhow.\" He mumbled a sentence Graham did not\nunderstand.\n\n\"The Sleeper--when did he awake?\" said Graham suddenly.\n\n\"Three days ago.\"\n\n\"Where is he?\"\n\n\"Ostrog has him. He escaped from the Council not four hours ago. My\ndear sir, where were you at the time? He was in the hall of the\nmarkets--where the fighting has been. All the city was screaming about\nit. All the Babble Machines! Everywhere it was shouted. Even the fools\nwho speak for the Council were admitting it. Everyone was rushing off to\nsee him--everyone was getting arms. Were you drunk or asleep? And even\nthen! But you're joking! Surely you're pretending. It was to stop the\nshouting of the Babble Machines and prevent the people gathering that\nthey turned off the electricity--and put this damned darkness upon us.\nDo you mean to say--?\"\n\n\"I had heard the Sleeper was rescued,\" said Graham. \"But--to come back a\nminute. Are you sure Ostrog has him?\"\n\n\"He won't let him go,\" said the old man.\n\n\"And the Sleeper. Are you sure he is not genuine? I have never heard--\"\n\n\"So all the fools think. So they think. As if there wasn't a thousand\nthings that were never heard. I know Ostrog too well for that. Did\nI tell you? In a way I'm a sort of relation of Ostrog's. A sort of\nrelation. Through my daughter-in-law.\"\n\n\n\"I suppose--\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I suppose there's no chance of this Sleeper asserting himself. I\nsuppose he's certain to be a puppet--in Ostrog's hands or the Council's,\nas soon as the struggle is over.\"\n\n\"In Ostrog's hands--certainly. Why shouldn't he be a puppet? Look at his\nposition. Everything done for him, every pleasure possible. Why should\nhe want to assert himself?\"\n\n\"What are these Pleasure Cities?\" said Graham, abruptly.\n\nThe old man made him repeat the question. When at last he was assured\nof Graham's words, he nudged him violently. \"That's too much,\" said he.\n\"You're poking fun at an old man. I've been suspecting you know more\nthan you pretend.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I do,\" said Graham. \"But no! why should I go on acting? No, I\ndo not know what a Pleasure City is.\"\n\nThe old man laughed in an intimate way.\n\n\"What is more, I do not know how to read your letters, I do not know\nwhat money you use, I do not know what foreign countries there are. I\ndo not know where I am. I cannot count. I do not know where to get food,\nnor drink, nor shelter.\"\n\n\"Come, come,\" said the old man, \"if you had a glass of drink, now, would\nyou put it in your ear or your eye?\"\n\n\"I want you to tell me all these things.\"\n\n\"He, he! Well, gentlemen who dress in silk must have their fun.\" A\nwithered hand caressed Graham's arm for a moment. \"Silk. Well, well!\nBut, all the same, I wish I was the man who was put up as the Sleeper.\nHe'll have a fine time of it. All the pomp and pleasure. He's a queer\nlooking face. When they used to let anyone go to see him, I've got\ntickets and been. The image of the real one, as the photographs show\nhim, this substitute used to be. Yellow. But he'll get fed up. It's a\nqueer world. Think of the luck of it. The luck of it. I expect he'll be\nsent to Capri. It's the best fun for a greener.\"\n\nHis cough overtook him again. Then he began mumbling enviously of\npleasures and strange delights. \"The luck of it, the luck of it! All my\nlife I've been in London, hoping to get my chance.\"\n\n\"But you don't know that the Sleeper died,\" said Graham, suddenly.\n\nThe old man made him repeat his words.\n\n\"Men don't live beyond ten dozen. It's not in the order of things,\" said\nthe old man. \"I'm not a fool. Fools may believe it, but not me.\"\n\nGraham became angry with the old man's assurance. \"Whether you are a\nfool or not,\" he said, \"it happens you are wrong about the Sleeper.\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"You are wrong about the Sleeper. I haven't told you before, but I will\ntell you now. You are wrong about the Sleeper.\"\n\n\"How do you know? I thought you didn't know anything--not even about\nPleasure Cities.\"\n\nGraham paused.\n\n\"You don't know,\" said the old man. \"How are you to know? It's very few\nmen--\"\n\n\"I _am_ the Sleeper.\"\n\nHe had to repeat it.\n\nThere was a brief pause. \"There's a silly thing to say, sir, if you'll\nexcuse me. It might get you into trouble in a time like this,\" said the\nold man. Graham, slightly dashed, repeated his assertion.\n\n\"I was saying I was the Sleeper. That years and years ago I did, indeed,\nfall asleep, in a little stonebuilt village, in the days when there were\nhedgerows, and villages, and inns, and all the countryside cut up into\nlittle pieces, little fields. Have you never heard of those days? And it\nis I--I who speak to you--who awakened again these four days since.\"\n\n\"Four days since!--the Sleeper! But they've got the Sleeper. They have\nhim and they won't let him go. Nonsense! You've been talking sensibly\nenough up to now. I can see it as though I was there. There will be\nLincoln like a keeper just behind him; they won't let him go about\nalone. Trust them. You're a queer fellow. One of these fun pokers. I see\nnow why you have been clipping your words so oddly, but--\"\n\nHe stopped abruptly, and Graham could see his gesture.\n\n\"As if Ostrog would let the Sleeper run about alone! No, you're telling\nthat to the wrong man altogether. Eh! as if I should believe. What's\nyour game? And besides, we've been talking of the Sleeper.\"\n\nGraham stood up. \"Listen,\" he said. \"I am the Sleeper.\"\n\n\"You're an odd man,\" said the old man, \"to sit here in the dark, talking\nclipped, and telling a lie of that sort. But--\"\n\nGraham's exasperation fell to laughter. \"It is preposterous,\" he cried.\n\"Preposterous. The dream must end. It gets wilder and wilder. Here am\nI--in this damned twilight--I never knew a dream in twilight before--an\nanachronism by two hundred years and trying to persuade an old fool that\nI am myself, and meanwhile--Ugh!\"\n\nHe moved in gusty irritation and went striding. In a moment the old man\nwas pursuing him. \"Eh! but don't go!\" cried the old man. \"I'm an old\nfool, I know. Don't go. Don't leave me in all this darkness.\"\n\nGraham hesitated, stopped. Suddenly the folly of telling his secret\nflashed into his mind.\n\n\"I didn't mean to offend you--disbelieving you,\" said the old man coming\nnear. \"It's no manner of harm. Call yourself the Sleeper if it pleases\nyou. 'Tis a foolish trick.\"\n\nGraham hesitated, turned abruptly and went on his way.\n\nFor a time he heard the old man's hobbling pursuit and his wheezy cries\nreceding. But at last the darkness swallowed him, and Graham saw him no\nmore.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. OSTROG\n\nGraham could now take a clearer view of his position. For a long time\nyet he wandered, but after the talk of the old man his discovery of this\nOstrog was clear in his mind as the final inevitable decision. One\nthing was evident, those who were at the headquarters of the revolt had\nsucceeded very admirably in suppressing the fact of his disappearance.\nBut every moment he expected to hear the report of his death or of his\nrecapture by the Council.\n\nPresently a man stopped before him. \"Have you heard?\" he said.\n\n\"No!\" said Graham starting.\n\n\"Near a dozand,\" said the man, \"a dozand men!\" and hurried on.\n\nA number of men and a girl passed in the darkness, gesticulating and\nshouting: \"Capitulated! Given up!\" \"A dozand of men.\" \"Two dozand of\nmen.\" \"Ostrog, Hurrah! Ostrog, Hurrah!\" These cries receded, became\nindistinct.\n\nOther shouting men followed. For a time his attention was absorbed\nin the fragments of speech he heard. He had a doubt whether all were\nspeaking English. Scraps floated to him, scraps like Pigeon English,\nlike 'nigger' dialect, blurred and mangled distortions. He dared\naccost no one with questions. The impression the people gave him jarred\naltogether with his preconceptions of the struggle and confirmed the\nold man's faith in Ostrog. It was only slowly he could bring himself\nto believe that all these people were rejoicing at the defeat of the\nCouncil, that the Council which had pursued him with such power and\nvigour was after all the weaker of the two sides in conflict. And if\nthat was so, how did it affect him? Several times he hesitated on the\nverge of fundamental questions. Once he turned and walked for a long\nway after a little man of rotund inviting outline, but he was unable to\nmaster confidence to address him.\n\nIt was only slowly that it came to him that he might ask for the\n\"wind-vane offices,\" whatever the \"wind-vane offices\" might be.\nHis first enquiry simply resulted in a direction to go on towards\nWestminster. His second led to the discovery of a short cut in which\nhe was speedily lost. He was told to leave the ways to which he had\nhitherto confined himself knowing no other means of transit--and\nto plunge down one of the middle staircases into the blackness of a\ncrossway. Thereupon came some trivial adventures; chief of these an\nambiguous encounter with a gruff-voiced invisible creature speaking in\na strange dialect that seemed at first a strange tongue, a thick flow of\nspeech with the drifting corpses of English words therein, the dialect\nof the latter-day vile. Then another voice drew near, a girl's voice\nsinging, \"tralala tralala.\" She spoke to Graham, her English touched\nwith something of the same quality. She professed to have lost her\nsister, she blundered needlessly into him he thought, caught hold of him\nand laughed. But a word of vague remonstrance sent her into the unseen\nagain.\n\nThe sounds about him increased. Stumbling people passed him, speaking\nexcitedly. \"They have surrendered!\" \"The Council! Surely not the\nCouncil!\" \"They are saying so in the Ways.\" The passage seemed wider.\nSuddenly the wall fell away. He was in a great space and people were\nstirring remotely. He inquired his way of an indistinct figure. \"Strike\nstraight across,\" said a woman's voice. He left his guiding wall, and in\na moment had stumbled against a little table on which were utensils of\nglass. Graham's eyes, now attuned to darkness, made out a long vista\nwith pallid tables on either side. He went down this. At one or two of\nthe tables he heard a clang of glass and a sound of eating. There were\npeople then cool enough to dine, or daring enough to steal a meal\nin spite of social convulsion and darkness. Far off and high up he\npresently saw a pallid light of a semi-circular shape. As he approached\nthis, a black edge came up and hid it. He stumbled at steps and found\nhimself in a gallery. He heard a sobbing, and found two scared little\ngirls crouched by a railing. These children became silent at the near\nsound of feet. He tried to console them, but they were very still until\nhe left them. Then as he receded he could hear them sobbing again.\n\nPresently he found himself at the foot of a staircase and near a wide\nopening. He saw a dim twilight above this and ascended out of the\nblackness into a street of moving Ways again. Along this a disorderly\nswarm of people marched shouting. They were singing snatches of the song\nof the revolt, most of them out of tune. Here and there torches flared\ncreating brief hysterical shadows. He asked his way and was twice\npuzzled by that same thick dialect. His third attempt won an answer\nhe could understand. He was two miles from the wind-vane offices in\nWestminster, but the way was easy to follow.\n\nWhen at last he did approach the district of the wind-vane offices it\nseemed to him, from the cheering processions that came marching along\nthe Ways, from the tumult of rejoicing, and finally from the restoration\nof the lighting of the city, that the overthrow of the Council must\nalready be accomplished. And still no news of his absence came to his\nears.\n\nThe re-illumination of the city came with startling abruptness. Suddenly\nhe stood blinking, all about him men halted dazzled, and the world was\nincandescent. The light found him already upon the outskirts of the\nexcited crowds that choked the Ways near the wind-vane offices, and the\nsense of visibility and exposure that came with it turned his colourless\nintention of joining Ostrog to a keen anxiety.\n\nFor a time he was jostled, obstructed, and endangered by men hoarse and\nweary with cheering his name, some of them bandaged and bloody in his\ncause. The frontage of the wind-vane offices was illuminated by some\nmoving picture, but what it was he could not see, because in spite\nof his strenuous attempts the density of the crowd prevented his\napproaching it. From the fragments of speech he caught, he judged it\nconveyed news of the fighting about the Council House. Ignorance and\nindecision made him slow and ineffective in his movements. For a time he\ncould not conceive how he was to get within the unbroken facade of this\nplace. He made his way slowly into the midst of this mass of people,\nuntil he realised that the descending staircase of the central Way led\nto the interior of the buildings. This gave him a goal, but the crowding\nin the central path was so dense that it was long before he could reach\nit. And even then he encountered intricate obstruction, and had an hour\nof vivid argument first in this guard room and then in that before he\ncould get a note taken to the one man of all men who was most eager\nto see him. His story was laughed to scorn at one place, and wiser for\nthat, when at last he reached a second stairway he professed simply to\nhave news of extraordinary importance for Ostrog. What it was he would\nnot say. They sent his note reluctantly. For a long time he waited in\na little room at the foot of the lift shaft, and thither at last came\nLincoln, eager, apologetic, astonished. He stopped in the doorway\nscrutinising Graham, then rushed forward effusively.\n\n\"Yes,\" he cried. \"It is you. And you are not dead!\"\n\nGraham made a brief explanation.\n\n\"My brother is waiting,\" explained Lincoln. \"He is alone in the\nwind-vane offices. We feared you had been killed in the theatre. He\ndoubted--and things are very urgent still in spite of what we are\ntelling them _there_--or he would have come to you.\"\n\nThey ascended a lift, passed along a narrow passage, crossed a\ngreat hall, empty save for two hurrying messengers, and entered a\ncomparatively little room, whose only furniture was a long settee and a\nlarge oval disc of cloudy, shifting grey, hung by cables from the wall.\nThere Lincoln left Graham for a space, and he remained alone without\nunderstanding the shifting smoky shapes that drove slowly across this\ndisc.\n\nHis attention was arrested by a sound that began abruptly. It was\ncheering, the frantic cheering of a vast but very remote crowd, a\nroaring exultation. This ended as sharply as it had begun, like a sound\nheard between the opening and shutting of a door. In the outer room was\na noise of hurrying steps and a melodious clinking as if a loose chain\nwas running over the teeth of a wheel.\n\nThen he heard the voice of a woman, the rustle of unseen garments. \"It\nis Ostrog!\" he heard her say. A little bell rang fitfully, and then\neverything was still again.\n\nPresently came voices, footsteps and movement without. The footsteps\nof some one person detached itself from the other sounds and drew\nnear, firm, evenly measured steps. The curtain lifted slowly. A tall,\nwhite-haired man, clad in garments of cream coloured silk, appeared,\nregarding Graham from under his raised arm.\n\nFor a moment the white form remained holding the curtain, then dropped\nit and stood before it. Graham's first impression was of a very broad\nforehead, very pale blue eyes deep sunken under white brows, an aquiline\nnose, and a heavily-lined resolute mouth. The folds of flesh over the\neyes, the drooping of the corners of the mouth contradicted the\nupright bearing, and said the man was old. Graham rose to his feet\ninstinctively, and for a moment the two men stood in silence, regarding\neach other.\n\n\"You are Ostrog?\" said Graham.\n\n\"I am Ostrog.\"\n\n\"The Boss?\"\n\n\"So I am called.\"\n\nGraham felt the inconvenience of the silence. \"I have to thank you\nchiefly, I understand, for my safety,\" he said presently.\n\n\"We were afraid you were killed,\" said Ostrog.\n\n\"Or sent to sleep again--for ever. We have been doing everything to keep\nour secret--the secret of your disappearance. Where have you been? How\ndid you get here?\"\n\nGraham told him briefly.\n\nOstrog listened in silence.\n\nHe smiled faintly. \"Do you know what I was doing when they came to tell\nme you had come?\"\n\n\"How can I guess?\"\n\n\"Preparing your double.\"\n\n\"My double?\"\n\n\"A man as like you as we could find. We were going to hypnotise him, to\nsave him the difficulty of acting. It was imperative. The whole of this\nrevolt depends on the idea that you are awake, alive, and with us. Even\nnow a great multitude of people has gathered in the theatre clamouring\nto see you. They do not trust... You know, of course--something of your\nposition?\"\n\n\"Very little,\" said Graham.\n\n\"It is like this.\" Ostrog walked a pace or two into the room and turned.\n\"You are absolute owner,\" he said, \"of more than half the world. As a\nresult of that you are practically King. Your powers are limited in\nmany intricate ways, but you are the figure head, the popular symbol of\ngovernment. This White Council, the Council of Trustees as it is called.\"\n\n\"I have heard the vague outline of these things.\"\n\n\"I wondered.\"\n\n\"I came upon a garrulous old man.\"\n\n\"I see... Our masses--the word comes from your days--you know of course,\nthat we still have masses--regard you as our actual ruler. Just as a\ngreat number of people in your days regarded the Crown as the ruler.\nThey are discontented--the masses all over the earth--with the rule\nof your Trustees. For the most part it is the old discontent, the old\nquarrel of the common man with his commonness--the misery of work and\ndiscipline and unfitness. But your Trustees have ruled ill. In certain\nmatters, in the administration of the Labour Companies, for example,\nthey have been unwise. They have given endless opportunities. Already we\nof the popular party were agitating for reforms--when your waking came.\nCame! If it had been contrived it could not have come more opportunity.\"\nHe smiled. \"The public mind, making no allowance for your years of\nquiescence, had already hit on the thought of waking you and appealing\nto you, and--Flash!\"\n\nHe indicated the outbreak by a gesture, and Graham moved his head to\nshow that he understood.\n\n\"The Council muddled--quarreled. They always do. They could not decide\nwhat to do with you. You know how they imprisoned you?\"\n\n\"I see. I see. And now--we win?\"\n\n\"We win. Indeed we win. Tonight, in five swift hours. Suddenly we struck\neverywhere. The windvane people, the Labour Company and its millions,\nburst the bonds. We got the pull of the aeropiles.\"\n\nHe paused. \"Yes,\" said Graham, guessing that aeropile meant flying\nmachine.\n\n\"That was, of course, essential. Or they could have got away. All the\ncity rose, every third man almost was in it! All the blue, all the\npublic services, save only just a few aeronauts and about half the red\npolice. You were rescued, and their own police of the Ways--not half of\nthem could be massed at the Council House--have been broken up, disarmed\nor killed. All London is ours--now. Only the Council House remains.\n\n\"Half of those who remain to them of the red police were lost in that\nfoolish attempt to recapture you. They lost their heads when they lost\nyou. They flung all they had at the theatre. We cut them off from\nthe Council House there. Truly tonight has been a night of victory.\nEverywhere your star has blazed. A day ago--the White Council ruled as\nit has ruled for a gross of years, for a century and a half of years,\nand then, with only a little whispering, a covert arming here and there,\nsuddenly--So!\"\n\n\"I am very ignorant,\" said Graham. \"I suppose--. I do not clearly\nunderstand the conditions of this fighting. If you could explain. Where\nis the Council? Where is the fight?\"\n\nOstrog stepped across the room, something clicked, and suddenly,\nsave for an oval glow, they were in darkness. For a moment Graham was\npuzzled.\n\nThen he saw that the cloudy grey disc had taken depth and colour, had\nassumed the appearance of an oval window looking out upon a strange\nunfamiliar scene.\n\nAt the first glance he was unable to guess what this scene might be.\nIt was a daylight scene, the daylight of a wintry day, grey and clear.\nAcross the picture and halfway as it seemed between him and the remoter\nview, a stout cable of twisted white wire stretched vertically. Then he\nperceived that the rows of great windwheels he saw, the wide intervals,\nthe occasional gulfs of darkness, were akin to those through which he\nhad fled from the Council House. He distinguished an orderly file of red\nfigures marching across an open space between files of men in black,\nand realised before Ostrog spoke that he was looking down on the upper\nsurface of latter-day London. The overnight snows had gone. He judged\nthat this mirror was some modern replacement of the camera obscura, but\nthat matter was not explained to him. He saw that though the file of red\nfigures was trotting from left to right, yet they were passing out of\nthe picture to the left. He wondered momentarily, and then saw that the\npicture was passing slowly, panorama fashion, across the oval.\n\n\"In a moment you will see the fighting,\" said Ostrog at his elbow.\n\"Those fellows in red you notice are prisoners. This is the roof space\nof London--all the houses are practically continuous now. The streets\nand public squares are covered in. The gaps and chasms of your time have\ndisappeared.\"\n\nSomething out of focus obliterated half the picture. Its form suggested\na man. There was a gleam of metal, a flash, something that swept across\nthe oval, as the eyelid of a bird sweeps across its eye, and the picture\nwas clear again. And now Graham beheld men running down among the\nwind-wheels, pointing weapons from which jetted out little\nsmoky flashes. They swarmed thicker and thicker to the right,\ngesticulating--it might be they were shouting, but of that the picture\ntold nothing. They and the windwheels passed slowly and steadily across\nthe field of the mirror.\n\n\"Now,\" said Ostrog, \"comes the Council House,\" and slowly a black edge\ncrept into view and gathered Graham's attention. Soon it was no longer\nan edge but a cavity, a huge blackened space amidst the clustering\nedifices, and from it thin spires of smoke rose into the pallid winter\nsky. Gaunt ruinous masses of the building, mighty truncated piers and\ngirders, rose dismally out of this cavernous darkness. And over these\nvestiges of some splendid place, countless minute men were clambering,\nleaping, swarming.\n\n\"This is the Council House,\" said Ostrog. \"Their last stronghold. And\nthe fools wasted enough ammunition to hold out for a month in blowing up\nthe buildings all about them--to stop our attack. You heard the smash?\nIt shattered half the brittle glass in the city.\"\n\nAnd while he spoke, Graham saw that beyond this sea of ruins,\noverhanging it and rising to a great height, was a ragged mass of white\nbuilding. This mass had been isolated by the ruthless destruction of\nits surroundings. Black gaps marked the passages the disaster had torn\napart; big halls had been slashed open and the decoration of their\ninteriors showed dismally in the wintry dawn, and down the jagged wall\nhung festoons of divided cables and twisted ends of lines and metallic\nrods. And amidst all the vast details moved little red specks, the\nred-clothed defenders of the Council. Every now and then faint flashes\nilluminated the bleak shadows. At the first sight it seemed to Graham\nthat an attack upon this isolated white building was in progress, but\nthen he perceived that the party of the revolt was not advancing, but\nsheltered amidst the colossal wreckage that encircled this last ragged\nstronghold of the red-garbed men, was keeping up a fitful firing.\n\nAnd not ten hours ago he had stood beneath the ventilating fans in a\nlittle chamber within that remote building wondering what was happening\nin the world!\n\nLooking more attentively as this warlike episode moved silently across\nthe centre of the mirror, Graham saw that the white building was\nsurrounded on every side by ruins, and Ostrog proceeded to describe\nin concise phrases how its defenders had sought by such destruction to\nisolate themselves from a storm. He spoke of the loss of men that huge\ndownfall had entailed in an indifferent tone. He indicated an improvised\nmortuary among the wreckage showed ambulances swarming like cheese-mites\nalong a ruinous groove that had once been a street of moving ways. He\nwas more interested in pointing out the parts of the Council House, the\ndistribution of the besiegers. In a little while the civil contest\nthat had convulsed London was no longer a mystery to Graham. It was\nno tumultuous revolt had occurred that night, no equal warfare, but\na splendidly organised _coup d'etat_. Ostrog's grasp of details was\nastonishing; he seemed to know the business of even the smallest knot of\nblack and red specks that crawled amidst these places.\n\nHe stretched a huge black arm across the luminous picture, and showed\nthe room whence Graham had escaped, and across the chasm of ruins the\ncourse of his flight. Graham recognised the gulf across which the gutter\nran, and the wind-wheels where he had crouched from the flying machine.\nThe rest of his path had succumbed to the explosion. He looked again at\nthe Council House, and it was already half hidden, and on the right a\nhillside with a cluster of domes and pinnacles, hazy, dim and distant,\nwas gliding into view.\n\n\"And the Council is really overthrown?\" he said.\n\n\"Overthrown,\" said Ostrog.\n\n\"And I--. Is it indeed true that I?\"\n\n\"You are Master of the World.\"\n\n\"But that white flag--\"\n\n\"That is the flag of the Council--the flag of the Rule of the World. It\nwill fall. The fight is over. Their attack on the theatre was their last\nfrantic struggle. They have only a thousand men or so, and some of these\nmen will be disloyal. They have little ammunition. And we are reviving\nthe ancient arts. We are casting guns.\"\n\n\"But--help. Is this city the world?\"\n\n\"Practically this is all they have left to them of their empire.\nAbroad the cities have either revolted with us or wait the issue. Your\nawakening has perplexed them, paralysed them.\"\n\n\"But haven't the Council flying machines? Why is there no fighting with\nthem?\"\n\n\"They had. But the greater part of the aeronauts were in the revolt with\nus. They wouldn't take the risk of fighting on our side, but they would\nnot stir against us. We had to get a pull with the aeronauts. Quite half\nwere with us, and the others knew it. Directly they knew you had got\naway, those looking for you dropped. We killed the man who shot at\nyou--an hour ago. And we occupied the flying stages at the outset in\nevery city we could, and so stopped and captured the airplanes, and as\nfor the little flying machines that turned out--for some did--we kept up\ntoo straight and steady a fire for them to get near the Council House.\nIf they dropped they couldn't rise again, because there's no clear space\nabout there for them to get up. Several we have smashed, several others\nhave dropped and surrendered, the rest have gone off to the Continent\nto find a friendly city if they can before their fuel runs out. Most of\nthese men were only too glad to be taken prisoner and kept out of harm's\nway. Upsetting in a flying machine isn't a very attractive prospect.\nThere's no chance for the Council that way. Its days are done.\"\n\nHe laughed and turned to the oval reflection again to show Graham what\nhe meant by flying stages. Even the four nearer ones were remote and\nobscured by a thin morning haze. But Graham could perceive they were\nvery vast structures, judged even by the standard of the things about\nthem.\n\nAnd then as these dim shapes passed to the left there came again the\nsight of the expanse across which the disarmed men in red had been\nmarching. And then the black ruins, and then again the beleaguered\nwhite fastness of the Council. It appeared no longer a ghostly pile, but\nglowing amber in the sunlight, for a cloud shadow had passed. About it\nthe pigmy struggle still hung in suspense, but now the red defenders\nwere no longer firing.\n\nSo, in a dusky stillness, the man from the nineteenth century saw the\nclosing scene of the great revolt, the forcible establishment of his\nrule. With a quality of startling discovery it came to him that this\nwas his world, and not that other he had left behind; that this was no\nspectacle to culminate and cease; that in this world lay whatever\nlife was still before him, lay all his duties and dangers and\nresponsibilities. He turned with fresh questions. Ostrog began to answer\nthem, and then broke off abruptly. \"But these things I must explain more\nfully later. At present there are--duties. The people are coming by the\nmoving ways towards this ward from every part of the city--the markets\nand theatres are densely crowded. You are just in time for them. They\nare clamouring to see you. And abroad they want to see you. Paris,\nNew York, Chicago, Denver, Capri--thousands of cities are up and in a\ntumult, undecided, and clamouring to see you. They have clamoured that\nyou should be awakened for years, and now it is done they will scarcely\nbelieve--\"\n\n\"But surely--I can't go...\"\n\nOstrog answered from the other side of the room, and the picture\non the oval disc paled and vanished as the light jerked back again.\n\"There are kinetotele-photographs,\" he said. \"As you bow to the people\nhere--all over the world myriads of myriads of people, packed and still\nin darkened halls, will see you also. In black and white, of course--not\nlike this. And you will hear their shouts reinforcing the shouting in\nthe hall.\n\n\"And there is an optical contrivance we shall use,\" said Ostrog, \"used\nby some of the posturers and women dancers. It may be novel to you. You\nstand in a very bright light, and they see not you but a magnified\nimage of you thrown on a screen--so that even the furtherest man in the\nremotest gallery can, if he chooses, count your eyelashes.\"\n\nGraham clutched desperately at one of the questions in his mind. \"What\nis the population of London?\"\n\n\"Eight and twaindy myriads.\"\n\n\"Eight and what?\"\n\n\"More than thirty-three millions.\"\n\nThese figures went beyond Graham's imagination \"You will be expected to\nsay something,\" said Ostrog. \"Not what you used to call a Speech, but\nwhat our people call a Word--just one sentence, six or seven words.\nSomething formal. If I might suggest--'I have awakened and my heart is\nwith you.' That is the sort of thing they want.\"\n\n\"What was that?\" asked Graham.\n\n\"'I am awakened and my heart is with you.' And bow--bow royally. But\nfirst we must get you black robes--for black is your colour. Do you\nmind? And then they will disperse to their homes.\"\n\nGraham hesitated. \"I am in your hands,\" he said.\n\nOstrog was clearly of that opinion. He thought for a moment, turned\nto the curtain and called brief directions to some unseen attendants.\nAlmost immediately a black robe, the very fellow of the black robe\nGraham had worn in the theatre, was brought. And as he threw it about\nhis shoulders there came from the room without the shrilling of a\nhigh-pitched bell. Ostrog turned in interrogation to the attendant,\nthen suddenly seemed to change his mind, pulled the curtain aside and\ndisappeared.\n\nFor a moment Graham stood with the deferential attendant listening\nto Ostrog's retreating steps. There was a sound of quick question and\nanswer and of men running. The curtain was snatched back and Ostrog\nreappeared, his massive face glowing with excitement. He crossed the\nroom in a stride, clicked the room into darkness, gripped Grahams arm\nand pointed to the mirror.\n\n\"Even as we turned away,\" he said.\n\nGraham saw his index finger, black and colossal, above the mirrored\nCouncil House. For a moment he did not understand. And then he perceived\nthat the flagstaff that had carried the white banner was bare.\n\n\"Do you mean--?\" he began.\n\n\"The Council has surrendered. Its rule is at an end for evermore.\"\n\n\"Look!\" and Ostrog pointed to a coil of black that crept in little jerks\nup the vacant flagstaff, unfolding as it rose.\n\nThe oval picture paled as Lincoln pulled the curtain aside and entered.\n\n\"They are clamourous,\" he said.\n\nOstrog kept his grip of Graham's arm.\n\n\"We have raised the people,\" he said. \"We have given them arms. For\ntoday at least their wishes must be law.\"\n\nLincoln held the Curtain open for Graham and Ostrog to pass through.\n\nOn his way to the markets Graham had a transitory glance of a long\nnarrow white-walled room in which men in the universal blue canvas\nwere carrying covered things like biers, and about which men in medical\npurple hurried to and fro. From this room came groans and wailing.\nHe had an impression of an empty blood-stained couch, of men on other\ncouches, bandaged and blood-stained. It was just a glimpse from a railed\nfootway and then a buttress hid the place and they were going on towards\nthe markets.\n\nThe roar of the multitude was near now: it leapt to thunder. And,\narresting his attention, a fluttering of black banners, the waving of\nblue canvas and brown rags, and the swarming vastness of the theatre\nnear the public markets came into view down a long passage. The picture\nopened out. He perceived they were entering the great theatre of his\nfirst appearance, the great theatre he had last seen as a chequer-work\nof glare and blackness in his flight from the red police. This time he\nentered it along a gallery at a level high above the stage. The place\nwas now brilliantly lit again. He sought the gangway up which he had\nfled, but he could not tell it from among its dozens of fellows; nor\ncould he see anything of the smashed seats, deflated cushions, and such\nlike traces of the fight because of the density of the people. Except\nthe stage the whole place was closely packed. Looking down the effect\nwas a vast area of stippled pink, each dot a still upturned face\nregarding him. At his appearance with Ostrog the cheering died away, the\nsinging died away, a common interest stilled and unified the disorder.\nIt seemed as though every individual of those myriads was watching him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. THE END OF THE OLD ORDER\n\n\nSo far as Graham was able to judge, it was near midday when the white\nbanner of the Council fell. But some hours had to elapse before it was\npossible to effect the formal capitulation, and so after he had spoken\nhis \"Word\" he retired to his new apartments in the wind-vane offices.\nThe continuous excitement of the last twelve hours had left him\ninordinately fatigued, even his curiosity was exhausted; for a space he\nsat inert and passive with open eyes, and for a space he slept. He\nwas roused by two medical attendants, come prepared with stimulants to\nsustain him through the next occasion. After he had taken their drugs\nand bathed by their advice in cold water, he felt a rapid return of\ninterest and energy, and was presently able and willing to accompany\nOstrog through several miles (as it seemed) of passages, lifts, and\nslides to the closing scene of the White Council's rule.\n\nThe way ran deviously through a maze of buildings. They came at last to\na passage that curved about, and showed broadening before him an oblong\nopening, clouds hot with sunset, and the ragged skyline of the ruinous\nCouncil House. A tumult of shouts came drifting up to him. In another\nmoment they had come out high up on the brow of the cliff of torn\nbuildings that overhung the wreckage. The vast area opened to Graham's\neyes, none the less strange and wonderful for the remote view he had had\nof it in the oval mirror.\n\nThis rudely amphitheatral space seemed now the better part of a mile to\nits outer edge. It was gold lit on the left hand, catching the sunlight,\nand below and to the right clear and cold in the shadow. Above the\nshadowy grey Council House that stood in the midst of it, the great\nblack banner of the surrender still hung in sluggish folds against\nthe blazing sunset. Severed rooms, halls and passages gaped strangely,\nbroken masses of metal projected dismally from the complex wreckage,\nvast masses of twisted cable dropped like tangled seaweed, and from its\nbase came a tumult of innumerable voices, violent concussions, and\nthe sound of trumpets. All about this great white pile was a ring of\ndesolation; the smashed and blackened masses, the gaunt foundations and\nruinous lumber of the fabric that had been destroyed by the Council's\norders, skeletons of girders, Titanic masses of wall, forests of stout\npillars. Amongst the sombre wreckage beneath, running water flashed and\nglistened, and far away across the space, out of the midst of a vague\nvast mass of buildings, there thrust the twisted end of a water-main,\ntwo hundred feet in the air, thunderously spouting a shining cascade.\nAnd everywhere great multitudes of people.\n\nWherever there was space and foothold, people swarmed, little people,\nsmall and minutely clear, except where the sunset touched them to\nindistinguishable gold. They clambered up the tottering walls, they\nclung in wreaths and groups about the high-standing pillars. They\nswarmed along the edges of the circle of ruins. The air was full of\ntheir shouting, and were pressing and swaying towards the central space.\n\nThe upper storeys of the Council House seemed deserted, not a human\nbeing was visible. Only the drooping banner of the surrender hung\nheavily against the light. The dead were within the Council House, or\nhidden by the swarming people, or carried away. Graham could see only\na few neglected bodies in gaps and corners of the ruins, and amidst the\nflowing water.\n\n\"Will you let them see you, Sire?\" said Ostrog. \"They are very anxious\nto see you.\"\n\nGraham hesitated, and then walked forward to where the broken verge\nof wall dropped sheer. He I stood looking down, a lonely, tall, black\nfigure against the sky.\n\nVery slowly the swarming ruins became aware of him. And as they did so\nlittle bands of black-uniformed men appeared remotely, thrusting through\nthe crowds towards the Council House. He saw little black heads become\npink, looking at him, saw by that means a wave of recognition sweep\nacross the space. It occurred to him that he should accord them some\nrecognition. He held up his arm, then pointed to the Council House and\ndropped his hand. The voices below became unanimous, gathered volume,\ncame up to him as multitudinous wavelets of cheering.\n\nThe western sky was a pallid bluish green, and Jupiter shone high in\nthe south, before the capitulation was accomplished. Above was a slow\ninsensible change, the advance of night serene and beautiful; below was\nhurry, excitement, conflicting orders, pauses, spasmodic developments of\norganisation, a vast ascending clamour and confusion. Before the Council\ncame out, toiling perspiring men, directed by a conflict of shouts,\ncarried forth hundreds of those who had perished in the hand-to-hand\nconflict within those long passages and chambers.\n\nGuards in black lined the way that the Council would come, and as far\nas the eye could reach into the hazy blue twilight of the ruins, and\nswarming now at every possible point in the captured Council House\nand along the shattered cliff of its circumadjacent buildings, were\ninnumerable people, and their voices even when they were not cheering,\nwere as the soughing of the sea upon a pebble beach. Ostrog had chosen\na huge commanding pile of crushed and overthrown masonry, and on this\na stage of timbers and metal girders was being hastily constructed.\nIts essential parts were complete, but humming and clangorous machinery\nstill glared fitfully in the shadows beneath this temporary edifice.\n\nThe stage had a small higher portion on which Graham stood with Ostrog\nand Lincoln close beside him, a little in advance of a group of minor\nofficers. A broader lower stage surrounded this quarter deck, and on\nthis were the black-uniformed guards of the revolt armed with the little\ngreen weapons whose very names Graham still did not know. Those standing\nabout him perceived that his eyes wandered perpetually from the swarming\npeople in the twilight ruins about him to the darkling mass of the White\nCouncil House, whence the Trustees would presently come, and to the\ngaunt cliffs of ruin that encircled him, and so back to the people. The\nvoices of the crowd swelled to a deafening tumult.\n\nHe saw the Councillors first afar off in the glare of one of the\ntemporary lights that marked their path, a little group of white figures\nblinking in a black archway. In the Council House they had been in\ndarkness. He watched them approaching, drawing nearer past first this\nblazing electric star and then that; the minatory roar of the crowd over\nwhom their power had lasted for a hundred and fifty years marched along\nbeside them. As they drew still nearer their faces came out weary, white\nand anxious. He saw them blinking up through the glare about him and\nOstrog. He contrasted their strange cold looks in the Hall of Atlas....\nPresently he could recognise several of them; the man who had rapped\nthe table at Howard, a burly man with a red beard, and one\ndelicate-featured, short, dark man with a peculiarly long skull. He\nnoted that two were whispering together and looking behind him at\nOstrog. Next there came a tall, dark and handsome man, walking downcast.\nAbruptly he glanced up, his eyes touched Graham for a moment, and\npassed beyond him to Ostrog. The way that had been made for them was so\ncontrived that they had to march past and curve about before they came\nto the sloping path of planks that ascended to the stage where their\nsurrender was to be made.\n\n\"The Master, the Master! God and the Master,\" shouted the people. \"To\nhell with the Council!\" Graham looked at their multitudes, receding\nbeyond counting into a shouting haze, and then at Ostrog beside him,\nwhite and steadfast and still. His eye went again to the little group\nof White Councillors. And then he looked up at the familiar quiet stars\noverhead. The marvellous element in his fate was suddenly vivid. Could\nthat be his indeed, that little life in his memory two hundred years\ngone by--and this as well?\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. FROM THE CROW'S NEST\n\nAnd so after strange delays and through an avenue of doubt and battle,\nthis man from the nineteenth century came at last to his position at the\nhead of that complex world.\n\nAt first when he rose from the long deep sleep that followed his rescue\nand the surrender of the Council, he did not recognise his surroundings.\nBy an effort he gained a clue in his mind, and all that had happened\ncame back to him, at first with a quality of insincerity like a story\nheard, like something read out of a book. And even before his memories\nwere clear, the exultation of his escape, the wonder of his prominence\nwere back in his mind. He was owner of half the world; Master of the\nEarth. This new great age was in the completest sense his. He no longer\nhoped to discover his experiences a dream; he became anxious now to\nconvince himself that they were real.\n\nAn obsequious valet assisted him to dress under the direction of a\ndignified chief attendant, a little man whose face proclaimed him\nJapanese, albeit he spoke English like an Englishman. From the latter he\nlearnt something of the state of affairs. Already the revolution was an\naccepted fact; already business was being resumed throughout the city.\nAbroad the downfall of the Council had been received for the most part\nwith delight. Nowhere was the Council popular, and the thousand cities\nof Western America, after two hundred years still jealous of New York,\nLondon, and the East, had risen almost unanimously two days before at\nthe news of Graham's imprisonment. Paris was fighting within itself. The\nrest of the world hung in suspense.\n\nWhile he was breaking his fast, the sound of a telephone bell jetted\nfrom a corner, and his chief attendant called his attention to the voice\nof Ostrog making polite enquiries. Graham interrupted his refreshment\nto reply. Very shortly Lincoln arrived, and Graham at once expressed\na strong desire to talk to people and to be shown more of the new life\nthat was opening before him. Lincoln informed him that in three hours'\ntime a representative gathering of officials and their wives would be\nheld in the state apartments of the wind-vane Chief. Graham's desire\nto traverse the ways of the city was, however, at present impossible,\nbecause of the enormous excitement of the people. It was, however, quite\npossible for him to take a bird's eye view of the city from the crow's\nnest of the windvane keeper. To this accordingly Graham was conducted\nby his attendant. Lincoln, with a graceful compliment to the attendant,\napologised for not accompanying them, on account of the present pressure\nof administrative work.\n\nHigher even than the most gigantic wind-wheels hung this crow's nest,\na clear thousand feet above the roofs, a little disc-shaped speck on a\nspear of metallic filigree, cable stayed. To its summit Graham was drawn\nin a little wire-hung cradle. Halfway down the frail-seeming stem was\na light gallery about which hung a cluster of tubes--minute they looked\nfrom above--rotating slowly on the ring of its outer rail. These were\nthe specula, _en rapport_ with the wind-vane keeper's mirrors, in one\nof which Ostrog had shown him the coming of his rule. His Japanese\nattendant ascended before him and they spent nearly an hour asking and\nanswering questions.\n\nIt was a day full of the promise and quality of spring. The touch of the\nwind warmed. The sky was an intense blue and the vast expanse of London\nshone dazzling under the morning sun. The air was clear of smoke and\nhaze, sweet as the air of a mountain glen.\n\nSave for the irregular oval of ruins about the House of the Council and\nthe black flag of the surrender that fluttered there, the mighty city\nseen from above showed few signs of the swift revolution that had, to\nhis imagination, in one night and one day, changed the destinies of the\nworld. A multitude of people still swarmed over these ruins, and the\nhuge openwork stagings in the distance from which started in times of\npeace the service of aeroplanes to the various great cities of Europe\nand America, were also black with the victors. Across a narrow way of\nplanking raised on trestles that crossed the ruins a crowd of workmen\nwere busy restoring the connection between the cables and wires of the\nCouncil House and the rest of the city, preparatory to the transfer\nthither of Ostrog's headquarters from the Wind-Vane buildings.\n\nFor the rest the luminous expanse was undisturbed. So vast was its\nserenity in comparison with the areas of disturbance, that presently\nGraham, looking beyond them, could almost forget the thousands of men\nlying out of sight in the artificial glare within the quasi-subterranean\nlabyrinth, dead or dying of the overnight wounds, forget the improvised\nwards with the hosts of surgeons, nurses, and bearers feverishly busy,\nforget, indeed, all the wonder, consternation and novelty under the\nelectric lights. Down there in the hidden ways of the anthill he knew\nthat the revolution triumphed, that black everywhere carried the day,\nblack favours, black banners, black festoons across the streets. And out\nhere, under the fresh sunlight, beyond the crater of the fight, as if\nnothing had happened to the earth, the forest of Wind Vanes that had\ngrown from one or two while the Council had ruled, roared peacefully\nupon their incessant duty.\n\nFar away, spiked, jagged and indented by the wind vanes, the Surrey\nHills rose blue and faint; to the north and nearer, the sharp contours\nof Highgate and Muswell Hill were similarly jagged. And all over the\ncountryside, he knew, on every crest and hill, where once the hedges\nhad interlaced, and cottages, churches, inns, and farmhouses had nestled\namong their trees, wind wheels similar to those he saw and bearing like\nvast advertisements, gaunt and distinctive symbols of the new age, cast\ntheir whirling shadows and stored incessantly the energy that flowed\naway incessantly through all the arteries of the city. And underneath\nthese wandered the countless flocks and herds of the British Food Trust\nwith their lonely guards and keepers.\n\nNot a familiar outline anywhere broke the cluster of gigantic shapes\nbelow. St. Paul's he knew survived, and many of the old buildings in\nWestminster, embedded out of sight, arched over and covered in among the\ngiant growths of this great age. The Themes, too, made no fall and gleam\nof silver to break the wilderness of the city; the thirsty water mains\ndrank up every drop of its waters before they reached the walls. Its bed\nand estuary scoured and sunken, was now a canal of sea water and a race\nof grimy bargemen brought the heavy materials of trade from the Pool\nthereby beneath the very feet of the workers. Faint and dim in the\neastward between earth and sky hung the clustering masts of the colossal\nshipping in the Pool. For all the heavy traffic, for which there was\nno need of haste, came in gigantic sailing ships from the ends of the\nearth, and the heavy goods for which there was urgency in mechanical\nships of a smaller swifter sort.\n\nAnd to the south over the hills, came vast aqueducts with sea water\nfor the sewers and in three separate directions, ran pallid lines--the\nroads, stippled with moving grey specks. On the first occasion that\noffered he was determined to go out and see these roads. That would come\nafter the flying ship he was presently to try. His attendant officer\ndescribed them as a pair of gently curving surfaces a hundred yards\nwide, each one for the traffic going in one direction, and made of a\nsubstance called Eadhamite--an artificial substance, so far as he could\ngather, resembling toughened glass. Along this shot a strange traffic of\nnarrow rubber-shod vehicles, great single wheels, two and four wheeled\nvehicles, sweeping along at velocities of from one to six miles\na minute. Railroads had vanished; a few embankments remained as\nrust-crowned trenches here and there. Some few formed the cores of\nEadhamite ways.\n\nAmong the first things to strike his attention had been the great fleets\nof advertisement balloons and kites that receded in irregular vistas\nnorthward and southward along the lines of the aeroplane journeys. No\naeroplanes were to be seen. Their passages had ceased, and only one\nlittle-seeming aeropile circled high in the blue distance above the\nSurrey Hills, an unimpressive soaring speck.\n\nA thing Graham had already learnt, and which he found very hard to\nimagine, was that nearly all the towns in the country, and almost all\nthe villages, had disappeared. Here and there only, he understood,\nsome gigantic hotel-like edifice stood amid square miles of some single\ncultivation and preserved the name of a town--as Bournemouth, Wareham,\nor Swanage. Yet the officer had speedily convinced him how inevitable\nsuch a change had been. The old order had dotted the country with\nfarmhouses, and every two or three miles was the ruling landlord's\nestate, and the place of the inn and cobbler, the grocer's shop and\nchurch--the village. Every eight miles or so was the country town,\nwhere lawyer, corn merchant, wool-stapler, saddler, veterinary surgeon,\ndoctor, draper, milliner and so forth lived. Every eight miles--simply\nbecause that eight mile marketing journey, four there and back, was as\nmuch as was comfortable for the farmer. But directly the railways came\ninto play, and after them the light railways, and all the swift new\nmotor cars that had replaced waggons and horses, and so soon as the high\nroads began to be made of wood, and rubber, and Eadhamite, and all sorts\nof elastic durable substances--the necessity of having such frequent\nmarket towns disappeared. And the big towns grew. They drew the worker\nwith the gravitational force of seemingly endless work, the employer\nwith their suggestions of an infinite ocean of labour.\n\nAnd as the standard of comfort rose, as the complexity of the mechanism\nof living increased life in the country had become more and more costly,\nor narrow and impossible. The disappearance of vicar and squire, the\nextinction of the general practitioner by the city specialist, had\nrobbed the village of its last touch of culture. After telephone,\nkinematograph and phonograph had replaced newspaper, book, schoolmaster,\nand letter, to live outside the range of the electric cables was to live\nan isolated savage. In the country were neither means of being clothed\nnor fed (according to the refined conceptions of the time), no efficient\ndoctors for an emergency, no company and no pursuits.\n\nMoreover, mechanical appliances in agriculture made one engineer the\nequivalent of thirty labourers. So, inverting the condition of the city\nclerk in the days when London was scarce inhabitable because of the\ncoaly foulness of its air, the labourers now came hurrying by road or\nair to the city and its life and delights at night to leave it again in\nthe morning. The city had swallowed up humanity; man had entered upon a\nnew stage in his development. First had come the nomad, the hunter, then\nhad followed the agriculturist of the agricultural state, whose towns\nand cities and ports were but the headquarters and markets of the\ncountryside. And now, logical consequence of an epoch of invention,\nwas this huge new aggregation of men. Save London, there were only\nfour other cities in Britain--Edinburgh, Portsmouth, Manchester and\nShrewsbury. Such things as these, simple statements of fact though they\nwere to contemporary men, strained Graham's imagination to picture. And\nwhen he glanced \"over beyond there\" at the strange things that existed\non the Continent, it failed him altogether.\n\nHe had a vision of city beyond city, cities on great plains, cities\nbeside great rivers, vast cities along the sea margin, cities girdled by\nsnowy mountains. Over a great part of the earth the English tongue was\nspoken; taken together with its Spanish American and Hindoo and Negro\nand \"Pidgin\" dialects, it was the everyday language of two-thirds of\nthe people of the earth. On the Continent, save as remote and curious\nsurvivals, three other languages alone held sway--German, which reached\nto Antioch and Genoa and jostled Spanish-English at Gdiz, a Gallicised\nRussian which met the Indian English in Persia and Kurdistan and the\n\"Pidgin\" English in Pekin, and French still clear and brilliant, the\nlanguage of lucidity, which shared the Mediterranean with the Indian\nEnglish and German and reached through a negro dialect to the Congo.\n\nAnd everywhere now, through the city-set earth, save in the administered\n\"black belt\" territories of the tropics, the same cosmopolitan social\norganisation prevailed, and everywhere from Pole to Equator his property\nand his responsibilities extended. The whole world was civilised; the\nwhole world dwelt in cities; the whole world was property. Over the\nBritish Empire and throughout America his ownership was scarcely\ndisguised, Congress and Parliament were usually regarded as antique,\ncurious gatherings. And even in the two Empires of Russia and Germany,\nthe influence of his wealth was conceivably of enormous weight. There,\nof course, came problems--possibilities, but, uplifted as he was, even\nRussia and Germany seemed sufficiently remote. And of the quality of the\nblack belt administration, and of what that might mean for him he\nthought, after the fashion of his former days, not at all. That it\nshould hang like a threat over the spacious vision before him could not\nenter his nineteenth century mind. But his mind turned at once from the\nscenery to the thought of a vanished dread. \"What of the yellow peril?\"\nhe asked and Asano made him explain. The Chinese spectre had vanished.\nChinaman and European were at peace. The twentieth century had\ndiscovered with reluctant certainty that the average Chinaman was as\ncivilised, more moral, and far more intelligent than the average\nEuropean serf, and had repeated on a gigantic scale the fraternisation\nof Scot and Englishman that happened in the seventeenth century. As\nAsano put it; \"They thought it over. They found we were white men after\nall.\" Graham turned again to the view and his thoughts took a new\ndirection.\n\nOut of the dim south-west, glittering and strange, voluptuous, and\nin some way terrible, shone those Pleasure Cities, of which the\nkinematograph-phonograph and the old man in the street had spoken.\nStrange places reminiscent of the legendary Sybaris, cities of art and\nbeauty, mercenary art and mercenary beauty, sterile wonderful cities\nof motion and music, whither repaired all who profited by the fierce,\ninglorious, economic struggle that went on in the glaring labyrinth\nbelow.\n\nFierce he knew it was. How fierce he could judge from the fact that\nthese latter-day people referred back to the England of the nineteenth\ncentury as the figure of an idyllic easy-going life. He turned his eyes\nto the scene immediately before him again, trying to conceive the big\nfactories of that intricate maze.\n\nNorthward he knew were the potters, makers not only of earthenware and\nchina, but of the kindred pastes and compounds a subtler mineralogical\nchemistry had devised; there were the makers of statuettes and wall\nornaments and much intricate furniture; there too were the factories\nwhere feverishly competitive authors devised their phonograph discourses\nand advertisements and arranged the groupings and developments for their\nperpetually startling and novel kinematographic dramatic works. Thence,\ntoo, flashed the world-wide messages, the world-wide falsehoods of the\nnews-tellers, the chargers of the telephonic machines that had replaced\nthe newspapers of the past.\n\nTo the westward beyond the smashed Council House were the voluminous\noffices of municipal control and government; and to the eastward,\ntowards the port, the trading quarters, the huge public markets, the\ntheatres, houses of resort, betting palaces, miles of billiard saloons,\nbaseball and football circuses, wild beast rings and the innumerable\ntemples of the Christian and quasi-Christian sects, the Mahomedans,\nBuddhists, Gnostics, Spook Worshippers, the Incubus Worshippers, the\nFurniture Worshippers, and so forth; and to the south again a vast\nmanufacture of textiles, pickles, wines and condiments. And from point\nto point tore the countless multitudes along the roaring mechanical\nways. A gigantic hive, of which the winds were tireless servants, and\nthe ceaseless wind-vanes an appropriate crown and symbol.\n\nHe thought of the unprecedented population that had been sucked up by\nthis sponge of halls and galleries--the thirty-three million lives that\nwere playing out each its own brief ineffectual drama below him, and the\ncomplacency that the brightness of the day and the space and splendour\nof the view, and above all the sense of his own importance had begotten,\ndwindled and perished. Looking down from this height over the city\nit became at last possible to conceive this overwhelming multitude of\nthirty-three millions, the reality of the responsibility he would take\nupon himself, the vastness of the human Maelstrom over which his slender\nkingship hung.\n\nHe tried to figure the individual life. It astonished him to realise how\nlittle the common man had changed in spite of the visible change in his\nconditions. Life and property, indeed, were secure from violence almost\nall over the world, zymotic diseases, bacterial diseases of all sorts\nhad practically vanished, everyone had a sufficiency of food and\nclothing, was warmed in the city ways and sheltered from the weather--so\nmuch the almost mechanical progress of science and the physical\norganisation of society had accomplished. But the crowd, he was already\nbeginning to discover, was a crowd still, helpless in the hands of\ndemagogue and organiser, individually cowardly, individually swayed by\nappetite, collectively incalculable. The memory of countless figures in\npale blue canvas came before his mind. Millions of such men and women\nbelow him, he knew, had never been out of the city, had never seen\nbeyond the little round of unintelligent grudging participation in the\nworld's business, and unintelligent dissatisfied sharing in its tawdrier\npleasures. He thought of the hopes of his vanished contemporaries,\nand for a moment the dream of London in Morris's quaint old _News\nfrom Nowhere_, and the perfect land of Hudson's beautiful _Crystal\nAge_--appeared before him in an atmosphere of infinite loss. He thought\nof his own hopes.\n\nFor in the latter days of that passionate life that lay now so far\nbehind him, the conception of a free and equal manhood had become a very\nreal thing to him. He had hoped, as indeed his age had hoped, rashly\ntaking it for granted, that the sacrifice of the many to the few would\nsome day cease, that a day was near when every child born of woman\nshould have a fair and assured chance of happiness. And here, after\ntwo hundred years, the same hope, still unfulfilled, cried passionately\nthrough the city. After two hundred years, he knew, greater than ever,\ngrown with the city to gigantic proportions, were poverty and helpless\nlabour and all the sorrows of his time.\n\nAlready he knew something of the history of the intervening years.\nHe had heard now of the moral decay that had followed the collapse of\nsupernatural religion in the minds of ignoble man, the decline of public\nhonour, the ascendency of wealth. For men who had lost their belief in\nGod had still kept their faith in property, and wealth ruled a venial\nworld.\n\nHis Japanese attendant, Asano, in expounding the political history of\nthe intervening two centuries, drew an apt image from a seed eaten by\ninsect parasites. First there is the original seed, ripening vigorously\nenough. And then comes some insect and lays an egg under the skin, and\nbehold! in a little while the seed is a hollow shape with an active grub\ninside that has eaten out its substance. And then comes some secondary\nparasite, some ichneumon fly, and lays an egg within this grub, and\nbehold! that, too, is a hollow shape, and the new living thing is inside\nits predecessor's skin which itself is snug within the seed coat. And\nthe seed coat still keeps its shape, most people think it a seed still,\nand for all one knows it may still think itself a seed, vigorous and\nalive. \"Your Victorian kingdom,\" said Asano, \"was like that--kingship\nwith the heart eaten out. The landowners--the barons and gentry--began\nages ago with King John; there were lapses, but they beheaded King\nCharles, and ended practically with King George mere husk of a king...\nthe real power in the hands of their parliament. But the Parliament--the\norgan of the land-holding tenant-ruling gentry--did not keep its\npower long. The change had already come in the nineteenth century. The\nfranchises had been broadened until it included masses of ignorant\nmen, 'urban myriads,' who went in their featureless thousands to vote\ntogether. And the natural consequence of a swarming constituency is the\nrule of the party organisation. Power was passing even in the Victorian\ntime to the party machinery, secret, complex, and corrupt. Very speedily\npower was in the hands of great men of business who financed the\nmachines. A time came when the real power and interest of the Empire\nrested visibly between the two party councils, ruling by newspapers and\nelectoral organisations--two small groups of rich and able men, working\nat first in opposition, then presently together.\"\n\nThere was a reaction of a genteel ineffectual sort. There were\nnumberless books in existence, Asano said, to prove that--the\npublication of some of them was as early as Graham's sleep--a whole\nliterature of reaction in fact. The party of the reaction seems to\nhave locked itself into its study and rebelled with unflinching\ndetermination--on paper. The urgent necessity of either capturing or\ndepriving the party councils of power is a common suggestion underlying\nall the thoughtful work of the early twentieth century, both in America\nand England. In most of these things America was a little earlier than\nEngland, though both countries drove the same way.\n\nThat counter-revolution never came. It could never organise and keep\npure. There was not enough of the old sentimentality, the old faith in\nrighteousness, left among men. Any organisation that became big enough\nto influence the polls became complex enough to be undermined, broken\nup, or bought outright by capable rich men. Socialistic and Popular,\nReactionary and Purity Parties were all at last mere Stock Exchange\ncounters, selling their principles to pay for their electioneering. And\nthe great concern of the rich was naturally to keep property intact, the\nboard clear for the game of trade. Just as the feudal concern had\nbeen to keep the board clear for hunting and war. The whole world was\nexploited, a battle field of businesses; and financial convulsions, the\nscourge of currency manipulation, tariff wars, made more human misery\nduring the twentieth century--because the wretchedness was dreary life\ninstead of speedy death--than had war, pestilence and famine, in the\ndarkest hours of earlier history.\n\nHis own part in the development of this time he now knew clearly enough.\nThrough the successive phases in the development of this mechanical\ncivilisation, aiding and presently directing its development, there had\ngrown a new power, the Council, the board of his trustees. At first it\nhad been a mere chance union of the millions of Isbister and Warming, a\nmere property holding company, the creation of two childless testators'\nwhims, but the collective talent of its first constitution had speedily\nguided it to a vast influence, until by title deed, loan and share,\nunder a hundred disguises and pseudonyms it had ramified through the\nfabric of the American and English States.\n\nWielding an enormous influence and patronage, the Council had early\nassumed a political aspect; and in its development it had continually\nused its wealth to tip the beam of political decisions and its political\nadvantages to grasp yet more and more wealth. At last the party\norganisations of two hemispheres were in its hands; it became an inner\ncouncil of political control. Its last struggle was with the tacit\nalliance of the great Jewish families. But these families were linked\nonly by a feeble sentiment, at any time inheritance might fling a huge\nfragment of their resources to a minor, a woman or a fool, marriages and\nlegacies alienated hundreds of thousands at one blow. The Council had no\nsuch breach in its continuity. Steadily, steadfastly it grew.\n\nThe original Council was not simply twelve men of exceptional ability;\nthey fused, it was a council of genius. It struck boldly for riches,\nfor political influence, and the two subserved each other. With amazing\nforesight it spent great sums of money on the art of flying, holding\nthat invention back against an hour foreseen. It used the patent laws,\nand a thousand half-legal expedients, to hamper all investigators who\nrefused to work with it. In the old days it never missed a capable man.\nIt paid his price. Its policy in those days was vigorous--unerring,\nand against it as it grew steadily and incessantly was only the chaotic\nselfish rule of the casually rich. In a hundred years Graham had become\nalmost exclusive owner of Africa, of South America, of France, of\nLondon, of England and all its influence--for all practical purposes,\nthat is--a power in North America--then the dominant power in America.\nThe Council bought and organised China, drilled Asia, crippled the Old\nWorld empires, undermined them financially, fought and defeated them.\n\nAnd this spreading usurpation of the world was so dexterously\nperformed--a proteus--hundreds of banks, companies, syndicates, masked\nthe Council's operations--that it was already far advanced before common\nmen suspected the tyranny that had come. The Council never hesitated,\nnever faltered. Means of communication, land, buildings, governments,\nmunicipalities, the territorial companies of the tropics, every human\nenterprise, it gathered greedily. And it drilled and marshalled its men,\nits railway police, its roadway police, its house guards, and drain and\ncable guards, its hosts of land-workers. Their unions it did not fight,\nbut it undermined and betrayed and bought them. It bought the world\nat last. And, finally, its culminating stroke was the introduction of\nflying.\n\nWhen the Council, in conflict with the workers in some of its huge\nmonopolies, did something flagrantly illegal and that without even the\nordinary civility of bribery, the old Law, alarmed for the profits of\nits complaisance, looked about it for weapons. But there were no\nmore armies, no fighting navies; the age of Peace had come. The\nonly possible war ships were the great steam vessels of the Council's\nNavigation Trust. The police forces they controlled; the police of\nthe railways, of the ships, of their agricultural estates, their\ntime-keepers and order-keepers, outnumbered the neglected little forces\nof the old country and municipal organisations ten to one. And they\nproduced flying machines. There were men alive still who could remember\nthe last great debate in the London House of Commons--the legal party,\nthe party against the Council was in a minority, but it made a desperate\nfight--and how the members came crowding out upon the terrace to see\nthese great unfamiliar winged shapes circling quietly overhead. The\nCouncil had soared to its power. The last sham of a democracy that had\npermitted unlimited irresponsible property was at an end.\n\nWithin one hundred and fifty years of Graham's falling asleep, his\nCouncil had thrown off its disguises and ruled openly, supreme in his\nname. Elections had become a cheerful formality, a septennial folly,\nan ancient unmeaning custom; a social Parliament as ineffectual as the\nconvocation of the Established Church in Victorian times assembled now\nand then; and a legitimate King of England, disinherited, drunken\nand witless, played foolishly in a second-rate music-hall. So the\nmagnificent dream of the nineteenth century, the noble project of\nuniversal individual liberty and universal happiness, touched by a\ndisease of honour, crippled by a superstition of absolute property,\ncrippled by the religious feuds that had robbed the common citizens of\neducation, robbed men of standards of conduct, and brought the sanctions\nof morality to utter contempt, had worked itself out in the face of\ninvention and ignoble enterprise, first to a warring plutocracy, and\nfinally to the rule of a supreme plutocrat. His Council at last\nhad ceased even to trouble to have its decrees endorsed by the\nconstitutional authorities, and he a motionless, sunken, yellow-skinned\nfigure had lain, neither dead nor living, recognisably and immediately\nMaster of the Earth. And awoke at last to find himself--Master of that\ninheritance! Awoke to stand under the cloudless empty sky and gaze down\nupon the greatness of his dominion.\n\nTo what end had he awakened? Was this city, this hive of hopeless\ntoilers, the final refutation of his ancient hopes? Or was the fire of\nliberty, the fire that had blazed and waned in the years of his past\nlife, still smouldering below there? He thought of the stir and impulse\nof the song of the revolution. Was that song merely the trick of a\ndemagogue, to be forgotten when its purpose was served? Was the hope\nthat still stirred within him only the memory of abandoned things,\nthe vestige of a creed outworn? Or had it a wider meaning, an import\ninterwoven with the destiny of man? To what end had he awakened, what\nwas there for him to do? Humanity was spread below him like a map. He\nthought of the millions and millions of humanity following each other\nunceasingly for ever out of the darkness of non-existence into the\ndarkness of death. To what end? Aim there must be, but it transcended\nhis power of thought. He saw for the first time clearly his own infinite\nlittleness, saw stark and terrible the tragic contrast of human strength\nand the craving of the human heart. For that little while he knew\nhimself for the petty accident he was, and knew therewith the greatness\nof his desire. And suddenly his littleness was intolerable, his\naspiration was intolerable, and there came to him an irresistible\nimpulse to pray. And he prayed. He prayed vague, incoherent,\ncontradictory things, his soul strained up through time and space and\nall the fleeting multitudinous confusion of being, towards something--he\nscarcely knew what--towards something that could comprehend his striving\nand endure.\n\nA man and a woman were far below on a roof space to the southward\nenjoying the freshness of the morning air. The man had brought out a\nperspective glass to spy upon the Council House and he was showing her\nhow to use it. Presently their curiosity was satisfied, they could see\nno traces of bloodshed from their position, and after a survey of the\nempty sky she came round to the crow's nest. And there she saw two\nlittle black figures, so small it was hard to believe they were men,\none who watched and one who gesticulated with hands outstretched to the\nsilent emptiness of Heaven.\n\nShe handed the glass to the man. He looked and exclaimed:\n\n\"I believe it is the Master. Yes. I am sure. It is the Master!\"\n\nHe lowered the glass and looked at her. \"Waving his hands about almost\nas if he was praying. I wonder what he is up to. Worshipping the sun?\nThere weren't Parses in this country in his time, were there?\"\n\nHe looked again. \"He's stopped it now. It was a chance attitude, I\nsuppose.\" He put down the glass and became meditative. \"He won't have\nanything to do but enjoy himself--just enjoy himself. Ostrog will boss\nthe show of course. Ostrog will have to, because of keeping all these\nLabourer fools in bounds. Them and their song! And got it all by\nsleeping, dear eyes--just sleeping. It's a wonderful world.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. PROMINENT PEOPLE\n\nThe state apartments of the Wind Vane Keeper would have seemed\nastonishingly intricate to Graham had he entered them fresh from his\nnineteenth century life, but already he was growing accustomed to the\nscale of the new time. They can scarcely be described as halls and\nrooms, seeing that a complicated system of arches, bridges, passages and\ngalleries divided and united every part of the great space. He came\nout through one of the now familiar sliding panels upon a. plateau of\nlanding at the head of a flight of very broad and gentle steps, with\nmen and women far more brilliantly dressed than any he had hitherto seen\nascending and descending. From this position he looked down a vista of\nintricate ornament in lustreless white and mauve and purple, spanned by\nbridges that seemed wrought of porcelain and filigree, and terminating\nfar off in a cloudy mystery of perforated screens.\n\nGlancing upward, he saw tier above tier of ascending galleries\nwith faces looking down upon him. The air was full of the babble of\ninnumerable voices and of a music that descended from above, a gay and\nexhilarating music whose source he never discovered.\n\nThe central aisle was thick with people, but by no means uncomfortably\ncrowded; altogether that assembly must have numbered many thousands.\nThey were brilliantly, even fantastically dressed, the men as fancifully\nas the women, for the sobering influence of the Puritan conception of\ndignity upon masculine dress had long since passed away. The hair of\nthe men, too, though it was rarely worn long, was commonly curled in\na manner that suggested the barber, and baldness had vanished from\nthe earth. Frizzy straight-cut masses that would have charmed Rossetti\nabounded, and one gentleman, who was pointed out to Graham under the\nmysterious title of an \"amorist\", wore his hair in two becoming plaits a\nla Marguerite. The pigtail was in evidence; it would seem that citizens\nof Chinese extraction were no longer ashamed of their race. There was\nlittle uniformity of fashion apparent in the forms of clothing worn. The\nmore shapely men displayed their symmetry in trunk hose, and here were\npuffs and slashes, and there a cloak and there a robe. The fashions of\nthe days of Leo the Tenth were perhaps the prevailing influence, but\nthe aesthetic conceptions of the far east were also patent. Masculine\nembonpoint, which, in Victorian times, would have been subjected to\nthe tightly buttoned perils, the ruthless exaggeration of tight-legged\ntight-armed evening dress, now formed but the basis of a wealth of\ndignity and drooping folds. Graceful slenderness abounded also. To\nGraham, a typically stiff man from a typically stiff period, not only\ndid these men seem altogether too graceful in person, but altogether too\nexpressive in their vividly expressive faces. They gesticulated, they\nexpressed surprise, interest, amusement, above all, they expressed\nthe emotions excited in their minds by the ladies about them with\nastonishing frankness. Even at the first glance it was evident that\nwomen were in a great majority.\n\nThe ladies in the company of these gentlemen displayed in dress, bearing\nand manner alike, less emphasis and more intricacy. Some affected a\nclassical simplicity of robing and subtlety of fold, after the fashion\nof the First French Empire, and flashed conquering arms and shoulders as\nGraham passed. Others had closely-fitting dresses without seam or belt\nat the waist, sometimes with long folds falling from the shoulders. The\ndelightful confidences of evening dress had not been diminished by the\npassage of two centuries.\n\nEveryone's movements seemed graceful. Graham remarked to Lincoln that\nhe saw men as Raphael's cartoons walking, and Lincoln told him that\nthe attainment of an appropriate set of gestures was part of every\nrich person's education. The Master's entry was greeted with a sort of\ntittering applause, but these people showed their distinguished manners\nby not crowding upon him nor annoying him by any persistent scrutiny, as\nhe descended the steps towards the floor of the aisle.\n\nHe had already learnt from Lincoln that these were the leaders of\nexisting London society; almost every person there that night was either\na powerful official or the immediate connexion of a powerful official.\nMany had returned from the European Pleasure Cities expressly to welcome\nhim. The aeronautic authorities, whose defection had played a part\nin the overthrow of the Council only second to Graham's were very\nprominent, and so, too, was the Wind Vane Control. Amongst others there\nwere several of the more prominent officers of the Food Trust; the\ncontroller of the European Piggeries had a particularly melancholy and\ninteresting countenance and a daintily cynical manner. A bishop in full\ncanonicals passed athwart Graham's vision, conversing with a gentleman\ndressed exactly like the traditional Chaucer, including even the laurel\nwreath.\n\n\"Who is that?\" he asked almost involuntarily\n\n\"The Bishop of London,\" said Lincoln.\n\n\"No--the other, I mean.\"\n\n\"Poet Laureate.\"\n\n\"You still?\"\n\n\"He doesn't make poetry, of course. He's a cousin of Wotton--one of\nthe Councillors. But he's one of the Red Rose Royalists--a delightful\nclub--and they keep up the tradition of these things.\"\n\n\"Asano told me there was a King.\"\n\n\"The King doesn't belong. They had to expel him. It's the Stuart blood,\nI suppose; but really--\"\n\n\"Too much?\"\n\n\"Far too much.\"\n\nGraham did not quite follow all this, but it seemed part of the\ngeneral inversion of the new age. He bowed condescendingly to his first\nintroduction. It was evident that subtle distinctions of class prevailed\neven in this assembly, that only to a small proportion of the guests,\nto an inner group, did Lincoln consider it appropriate to introduce him.\nThis first introduction was the Master Aeronaut, a man whose suntanned\nface contrasted oddly with the delicate complexions about him. Just\nat present his critical defection from the Council made him a very\nimportant person indeed.\n\nHis manner contrasted very favourably, according to Graham's ideas, with\nthe general bearing. He made a few commonplace remarks, assurances of\nloyalty and frank inquiries about the Master's health. His manner was\nbreezy, his accent lacked the easy staccato of latter-day English. He\nmade it admirably clear to Graham that he was a bluff \"aerial dog\"--he\nused that phrase--that there was no nonsense about him, that he was\na thoroughly manly fellow and old-fashioned at that, that he didn't\nprofess to know much, and that what he did not know was not worth\nknowing He made a manly bow, ostentatiously free from obsequiousness and\npassed.\n\n\"I am glad to see that type endures,\" said Graham\n\n\"Phonographs and kinematographs,\" said Lincoln, a little spitefully. \"He\nhas studied from the life.\" Graham glanced at the burly form again. It\nwas oddly reminiscent.\n\n\"As a matter of fact we bought him,\" said Lincoln. \"Partly. And partly\nhe was afraid of Ostrog. Everything rested with him.\"\n\nHe turned sharply to introduce the Surveyor-General of the Public School\nTrust. This person was a willowy figure in a blue-grey academic gown, he\nbeamed down upon Graham through _pince-nez_ of a Victorian pattern, and\nillustrated his remarks by gestures of a beautifully manicured hand.\nGraham was immediately interested in this gentleman's functions, and\nasked him a number of singularly direct questions. The Surveyor-General\nseemed quietly amused at the Master's fundamental bluntness. He was a\nlittle vague as to the monopoly of education his Company possessed; it\nwas done by contract with the syndicate that ran the numerous London\nMunicipalities, but he waxed enthusiastic over educational progress\nsince the Victorian times. \"We have conquered Cram,\" he said,\n\"completely conquered Cram--there is not an examination left in the\nworld. Aren't you glad?\"\n\n\"How do you get the work done?\" asked Graham.\n\n\"We make it attractive--as attractive as possible. And if it does not\nattract then--we let it go. We cover an immense field.\"\n\nHe proceeded to details, and they had a lengthy conversation. The\nSurveyor-General mentioned the names of Pestalozzi and Froebel\nwith profound respect, although he displayed no intimacy with their\nepoch-making works. Graham learnt that University Extension still\nexisted in a modified form. \"There is a certain type of girl, for\nexample,\" said the Surveyor-General, dilating with a sense of his\nusefulness, \"with a perfect passion for severe studies--when they are\nnot too difficult you know. We cater for them by the thousand. At\nthis moment,\" he said with a Napoleonic touch, \"nearly five hundred\nphonographs are lecturing in different parts of London on the influence\nexercised by Plato and Swift on the love affairs of Shelley, Hazlitt,\nand Burns. And afterwards they write essays on the lectures, and the\nnames in order of merit are put in conspicuous places. You see how your\nlittle germ has grown? The illiterate middle-class of your days has\nquite passed away.\"\n\n\"About the public elementary schools,\" said Graham. \"Do you control\nthem?\"\n\nThe Surveyor-General did, \"entirely.\" Now, Graham, in his later\ndemocratic days, had taken a keen interest in these and his questioning\nquickened. Certain casual phrases that had fallen from the old man\nwith whom he had talked in the darkness recurred to him. The\nSurveyor-General, in effect, endorsed the old man's words. \"We have\nabolished Cram,\" he said, a phrase Graham was beginning to interpret\nas the abolition of all sustained work. The Surveyor-General became\nsentimental. \"We try and make the elementary schools very pleasant for\nthe little children. They will have to work so soon. Just a few simple\nprinciples--obedience--industry.\"\n\n\"You teach them very little?\"\n\n\"Why should we? It only leads to trouble and discontent. We amuse them.\nEven as it is--there are troubles--agitations. Where the labourers get\nthe ideas, one cannot tell. They tell one another. There are socialistic\ndreams--anarchy even! Agitators will get to work among them. I take\nit--I have always taken it--that my foremost duty is to fight against\npopular discontent. Why should people be made unhappy?\"\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Graham thoughtfully. \"But there are a great many things\nI want to know.\"\n\nLincoln, who had stood watching Graham's face throughout the\nconversation, intervened. \"There are others,\" he said in an undertone.\n\nThe Surveyor-General of schools gesticulated himself away. \"Perhaps,\"\nsaid Lincoln, intercepting a casual glance, \"you would like to know some\nof these ladies?\"\n\nThe daughter of the Manager of the Piggeries of the European Food Trust\nwas a particularly charming little person with red hair and animated\nblue eyes. Lincoln left him awhile to converse with her, and she\ndisplayed herself as quite an enthusiast for the \"dear old times,\"\nas she called them, that had seen the beginning of his trance. As\nshe talked she smiled, and her eyes smiled in a manner that demanded\nreciprocity.\n\n\"I have tried,\" she said, \"countless times--to imagine those old\nromantic days. And to you they are memories. How strange and crowded the\nworld must seem to you! I have seen photographs and pictures of the old\ntimes, the little isolated houses built of bricks made out of burnt mud\nand all black with soot from your fires, the railway bridges, the simple\nadvertisements, the solemn savage Puritanical men in strange black\ncoats and those tall hats of theirs, iron railway trains on iron bridges\noverhead, horses and cattle, and even dogs running half wild about the\nstreets. And suddenly, you have come into this!\"\n\n\"Into this,\" said Graham.\n\n\"Out of your life--out of all that was familiar.\"\n\n\"The old life was not a happy one,\" said Graham. \"I do not regret that.\"\n\nShe looked at him quickly. There was a brief pause. She sighed\nencouragingly. \"No?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Graham. \"It was a little life--and unmeaning. But this--.\nWe thought the world complex and crowded and civilised enough. Yet I\nsee--although in this world I am barely four days old--looking back on\nmy own time, that it was a queer, barbaric time--the mere beginning of\nthis new order. The mere beginning of this new order. You will find it\nhard to understand how little I know.\"\n\n\"You may ask me what you like,\" she said, smiling at him.\n\n\"Then tell me who these people are. I'm still very much in the dark\nabout them. It's puzzling. Are there any Generals?\"\n\n\"Men in hats and feathers?\"\n\n\"Of course not. No. I suppose they are the men who control the great\npublic businesses. Who is that distinguished looking man?\"\n\n\"That? He's a most important officer. That is Morden. He is managing\ndirector of the Antibilious Pill Company. I have heard that his workers\nsometimes turn out a myriad myriad pills a day in the twenty-four hours.\nFancy a myriad myriad!\"\n\n\"A myriad myriad. No wonder he looks proud,\" said Graham. \"Pills! What a\nwonderful time it is! That man in purple?\"\n\n\"He is not quite one of the inner circle, you know. But we like him. He\nis really clever and very amusing. He is one of the heads of the\nMedical Faculty of our London University. All medical men, you know, are\nshareholders in the Medical Faculty Company, and wear that purple. You\nhave to be--to be qualified. But of course, people who are paid by fees\nfor doing something--\" She smiled away the social pretensions of all\nsuch people.\n\n\"Are any of your great artists or authors here?\"\n\n\"No authors. They are mostly such queer people--and so preoccupied about\nthemselves. And they quarrel so dreadfully! They will fight, some of\nthem, for precedence on staircases! Dreadful isn't it? But I think\nWraysbury, the fashionable capillotomist, is here. From Capri.\"\n\n\"Capillotomist,\" said Graham. \"Ah! I remember. An artist! Why not?\"\n\n\"We have to cultivate him,\" she said apologetically. \"Our heads are in\nhis hands.\" She smiled.\n\nGraham hesitated at the invited compliment, but his glance was\nexpressive. \"Have the arts grown with the rest of civilised things?\" he\nsaid. \"Who are your great painters?\"\n\nShe looked at him doubtfully. Then laughed. \"For a moment,\" she said, \"I\nthought you meant--\" She laughed again. \"You mean, of course, those good\nmen you used to think so much of because they could cover great spaces\nof canvas with oil-colours? Great oblongs. And people used to put the\nthings in gilt frames and hang them up in rows in their square rooms. We\nhaven't any. People grew tired of that sort of thing.\"\n\n\"But what did you think I meant?\"\n\nShe put a finger significantly on a cheek whose glow was above\nsuspicion, and smiled and looked very arch and pretty and inviting. \"And\nhere,\" and she indicated her eyelid.\n\nGraham had an adventurous moment. Then a grotesque memory of a picture\nhe had somewhere seen of Uncle Toby and the Widow flashed across his\nmind. An archaic shame came upon him. He became acutely aware that he\nwas visible to a great number of interested people. \"I see,\" he remarked\ninadequately. He turned awkwardly away from her, fascinating facility.\nHe looked about him to meet a number of eyes that immediately occupied\nthemselves with other things. Possibly he coloured a little. \"Who is\nthat talking with the lady in saffron?\" he asked, avoiding her eyes.\n\nThe person in question he learnt was one of the great organisers of the\nAmerican theatres just fresh from a gigantic production at Mexico. His\nface reminded Graham of a bust of Caligula. Another striking looking\nman was the Black Labour Master. The phrase at the time made no deep\nimpression, but afterwards it recurred;--the Black Labour Master? The\nlittle lady, in no degree embarrassed, pointed out to him a charming\nlittle woman as one of the subsidiary wives of the Anglican Bishop of\nLondon. She added encomiums on the episcopal courage--hitherto there had\nbeen a rule of clerical monogamy--\"neither a natural nor an expedient\ncondition of things. Why should the natural development of the\naffections be dwarfed and restricted because a man is a priest?\"\n\n\"And, bye the bye,\" she added, \"are you an Anglican?\" Graham was on the\nverge of hesitating inquiries about the status of a \"subsidiary wife,\"\napparently an euphemistic phrase, when Lincoln's return broke off this\nvery suggestive and interesting conversation. They crossed the aisle to\nwhere a tall man in crimson, and two charming persons in Burmese costume\n(as it seemed to him) awaited him diffidently. From their civilities he\npassed to other presentations.\n\nIn a little while his multitudinous impressions began to organise\nthemselves into a general effect. At first the glitter of the gathering\nhad raised all the democrat in Graham; he had felt hostile and\nsatirical. But it is not in human nature to resist an atmosphere of\ncourteous regard. Soon the music, the light, the play of colours, the\nshining arms and shoulders about him, the touch of hands, the transient\ninterest of smiling faces, the frothing sound of skillfully modulated\nvoices, the atmosphere of compliment, interest and respect, had woven\ntogether into a fabric of indisputable pleasure. Graham for a time\nforgot his spacious resolutions. He gave way insensibly to the\nintoxication of the position that was conceded him, his manner became\nless conscious, more convincingly regal, his feet walked assuredly, the\nblack robe fell with a bolder fold and pride ennobled his voice. After\nall this was a brilliant interesting world.\n\nHis glance went approvingly over the shifting colours of the people,\nit rested here and there in kindly criticism upon a face. Presently it\noccurred to him that he owed some apology to the charming little person\nwith the red hair and blue eyes. He felt guilty of a clumsy snub. It\nwas not princely to ignore her advances, even if his policy necessitated\ntheir rejection. He wondered if he should see her again. And suddenly\na little thing touched all the glamour of this brilliant gathering and\nchanged its quality.\n\nHe looked up and saw passing across a bridge of porcelain and looking\ndown upon him, a face that was almost immediately hidden, the face of\nthe girl he had seen overnight in the little room beyond the theatre\nafter his escape from the Council. And she was looking with much the\nsame expression of curious expectation, of uncertain intentness, upon\nhis proceedings. For the moment he did not remember when he had seen\nher, and then with recognition came a vague memory of the stirring\nemotions of their first encounter. But the dancing web of melody about\nhim kept the air of that great marching song from his memory.\n\nThe lady to whom he was talking repeated her remark, and Graham recalled\nhimself to the quasiregal flirtation upon which he was engaged.\n\nBut from that moment a vague restlessness, a feeling that grew to\ndissatisfaction, came into his mind. He was troubled as if by some\nhalf forgotten duty, by the sense of things important slipping from\nhim amidst this light and brilliance. The attraction that these bright\nladies who crowded about him were beginning to exercise ceased. He no\nlonger made vague and clumsy responses to the subtly amorous advances\nthat he was now assured were being made to him, and his eyes wandered\nfor another sight of that face that had appealed so strongly to his\nsense of beauty. But he did not see her again until he was awaiting\nLincoln's return to leave this assembly. In answer to his request\nLincoln had promised that an attempt should be made to fly that\nafternoon, if the weather permitted. He had gone to make certain\nnecessary arrangements.\n\nGraham was in one of the upper galleries in conversation with a\nbright-eyed lady on the subject of Eadhamite--the subject was his\nchoice and not hers. He had interrupted her warm assurances of personal\ndevotion with a matter-of-fact inquiry. He found her, as he had already\nfound several other latter-day women that night, less well informed\nthan charming. Suddenly, struggling against the eddying drift of nearer\nmelody, the song of the Revolt, the great song he had heard in the Hall,\nhoarse and massive, came beating down to him.\n\nHe glanced up startled, and perceived above him an _oeil de boeuf_\nthrough which this song had come, and beyond, the upper courses of\ncable, the blue haze, and the pendant fabric of the lights of the public\nways. He heard the song break into a tumult of voices and cease. But now\nhe perceived quite clearly the drone and tumult of the moving platforms\nand a murmur of many people. He had a vague persuasion that he could not\naccount for, a sort of instinctive feeling that outside in the ways a\nhuge crowd must be watching this place in which their Master amused\nhimself. He wondered what they might be thinking.\n\nThough the song had stopped so abruptly, though the special music of\nthis gathering reasserted itself, the motif of the marching song, once\nit had begun, lingered in his mind.\n\nThe bright-eyed lady was still struggling with the mysteries of\nEadhamite when he perceived the girl he had seen in the theatre again.\nShe was coming now along the gallery towards him; he saw her first\nbefore she saw him. She was dressed in a faintly luminous grey, her dark\nhair about her brows was like a cloud, and as he saw her the cold light\nfrom the circular opening into the ways fell upon her downcast face.\n\nThe lady in trouble about the Eadhamite saw the change in his\nexpression, and grasped her opportunity to escape. \"Would you care to\nknow that girl, Sire?\" she asked boldly. \"She is Helen Wotton--a niece\nof Ostrog's. She knows a great many serious things. She is one of the\nmost serious persons alive. I am sure you will like her.\"\n\nIn another moment Graham was talking to the girl, and the bright-eyed\nlady had fluttered away.\n\n\"I remember you quite well,\" said Graham. \"You were in that little\nroom. When all the people were singing and beating time with their feet.\nBefore I walked across the Hall.\"\n\nHer momentary embarrassment passed. She looked up at him, and her face\nwas steady. \"It was wonderful,\" she said, hesitated, and spoke with\na sudden effort. \"All those people would have died for you, Sire.\nCountless people did die for you that night.\"\n\nHer face glowed. She glanced swiftly aside to see that no other heard\nher words.\n\nLincoln appeared some way off along the gallery, making his way through\nthe press towards them. She saw him and turned to Graham strangely\neager, with a swift change to confidence and intimacy. \"Sire,\" she said\nquickly, \"I cannot tell you now and here. But the common people are very\nunhappy; they are oppressed--they are misgoverned. Do not forget the\npeople, who faced death--death that you might live.\"\n\n\"I know nothing--\" began Graham.\n\n\"I cannot tell you now.\"\n\nLincoln's face appeared close to them. He bowed an apology to the girl.\n\n\"You find the new world pleasant, Sire?\" asked Lincoln, with smiling\ndeference, and indicating the space and splendour of the gathering by\none comprehensive gesture. \"At any rate, you find it changed.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Graham, \"changed. And yet, after all, not so greatly\nchanged.\"\n\n\"Wait till you are in the air,\" said Lincoln. \"The wind has fallen; even\nnow an aeropile awaits you.\"\n\nThe girl's attitude awaited dismissal.\n\nGraham glanced at her face, was on the verge of a question, found a\nwarning in her expression, bowed to her and turned to accompany Lincoln.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. THE AEROPHILE\n\nFor a while, as Graham went through the passages of the Wind-Vane\noffices with Lincoln, he was preoccupied. But, by an effort, he attended\nto the things which Lincoln was saying. Soon his preoccupation vanished.\nLincoln was talking of flying. Graham had a strong desire to know more\nof this new human attainment. He began to ply Lincoln with questions.\nHe had followed the crude beginnings of aerial navigation very keenly in\nhis previous life; he was delighted to find the familiar names of\nMaxim and Pilcher, Langley and Chanute, and, above all, of the aerial\nproto-martyr Lillienthal, still honoured by men.\n\nEven during his previous life two lines of investigation had pointed\nclearly to two distinct types of contrivance as possible, and both of\nthese had been realised. On the one hand was the great engine-driven\naeroplane, a double row of horizontal floats with a big aerial screw\nbehind, and on the other the nimbler aeropile. The aeroplanes flew\nsafely only in a calm or moderate wind, and sudden storms, occurrences\nthat were now accurately predictable, rendered them for all practical\npurposes useless. They were built of enormous size--the usual stretch\nof wing being six hundred feet or more, and the length of the fabric a\nthousand feet. They were for passenger traffic alone. The lightly swung\ncar they carried was from a hundred to a hundred and fifty feet in\nlength. It Was hung in a peculiar manner in order to minimise the\ncomplex vibration that even a moderate wind produced, and for the same\nreason the little seats within the car--each passenger remained seated\nduring the voyage--were slung with great freedom of movement. The\nstarting of the mechanism was only possible from a gigantic car on\nthe rail of a specially constructed stage. Graham had seen these vast\nstages, the flying stages, from the crow's nest very well. Six huge\nblank areas they were, with a giant \"carrier\" stage on each.\n\nThe choice of descent was equally circumscribed, an accurately plane\nsurface being needed for safe grounding. Apart from the destruction that\nwould have been caused by the descent of this great expanse of sail and\nmetal, and the impossibility of its rising again, the concussion of an\nirregular surface, a tree-set hillside, for instance, or an embankment,\nwould be sufficient to pierce or damage the framework, to smash the ribs\nof the body, and perhaps kill those aboard.\n\nAt first Graham felt disappointed with these cumbersome contrivances,\nbut he speedily grasped the fact that smaller machines would have been\nunremunerative, for the simple reason that their carrying power would be\ndisproportionately diminished with diminished size. Moreover, the huge\nsize of these things enabled them--and it was a consideration of primary\nimportance--to traverse the air at enormous speeds, and so run no risks\nof unanticipated weather. The briefest journey performed, that from\nLondon to Paris, took about three-quarters of an hour, but the velocity\nattained was not high; the leap to New York occupied about two hours,\nand by timing oneself carefully at the intermediate stations it was\npossible in quiet weather to go around the world in a day.\n\nThe little aeropiles (as for no particular reason they were\ndistinctively called) were of an altogether different type. Several of\nthese were going to and fro in the air. They were designed to carry only\none or two persons, and their manufacture and maintenance was so costly\nas to render them the monopoly of the richer sort of people. Their\nsails, which were brilliantly coloured, consisted only of two pairs of\nlateral air floats in the same plane, and of a screw behind. Their\nsmall size rendered a descent in any open space neither difficult nor\ndisagreeable, and it was possible to attach pneumatic wheels or even the\nordinary motors for terrestrial traffic to them, and so carry them to a\nconvenient starting place. They required a special sort of swift car to\nthrow them into the air, but such a car was efficient in any open place\nclear of high buildings or trees. Human aeronautics, Graham perceived,\nwere evidently still a long way behind the instinctive gift of the\nalbatross or the fly-catcher. One great influence that might have\nbrought the aeropile to a more rapid perfection had been withheld; these\ninventions had never been used in warfare. The last great international\nstruggle had occurred before the usurpation of the Council.\n\nThe Flying Stages of London were collected together in an irregular\ncrescent on the southern side of the river. They formed three groups of\ntwo each and retained the names of ancient suburban hills or villages.\nThey were named in order, Roehampton, Wimbledon Park, Streatham,\nNorwood, Blackheath, and Shooter's Hill. They were uniform structures\nrising high above the general roof surfaces. Each was about four\nthousand yards long and a thousand broad, and constructed of the\ncompound of aluminium and iron that had replaced iron in architecture.\nTheir higher tiers formed an openwork of girders through which lifts\nand staircases ascended. The upper surface was a uniform expanse, with\nportions--the starting carriers--that could be raised and were then able\nto run on very slightly inclined rails to the end of the fabric. Save\nfor any aeropiles or aeroplanes that were in port these open surfaces\nwere kept clear for arrivals.\n\nDuring the adjustment of the aeroplanes it was the custom for passengers\nto wait in the system of theatres, restaurants, news-rooms, and places\nof pleasure and indulgence of various sorts that interwove with the\nprosperous shops below. This portion of London was in consequence\ncommonly the gayest of all its districts, with something of the\nmeretricious gaiety of a seaport or city of hotels. And for those who\ntook a more serious view of aeronautics, the religious quarters had\nflung out an attractive colony of devotional chapels, while a host\nof brilliant medical establishments competed to supply physical\npreparatives for the journey. At various levels through the mass of\nchambers and passages beneath these, ran, in addition to the main moving\nways of the city which laced and gathered here, a complex system of\nspecial passages and lifts and slides, for the convenient interchange of\npeople and luggage between stage and stage. And a distinctive feature of\nthe architecture of this section was the ostentatious massiveness of the\nmetal piers and girders that everywhere broke the vistas and spanned the\nhalls and passages, crowding and twining up to meet the weight of the\nstages and the weighty impact of the aeroplanes overhead.\n\nGraham went to the flying stages by the public ways. He was accompanied\nby Asano, his Japanese attendant. Lincoln was called away by Ostrog,\nwho was busy with his administrative concerns. A strong guard of the\nWind-Vane police awaited the Master outside the Wind-Vane offices, and\nthey cleared a space for him on the upper moving platform. His passage\nto the flying stages was unexpected, nevertheless a considerable crowd\ngathered and followed him to his destination. As he went along, he could\nhear the people shouting his name, and saw numberless men and women and\nchildren in blue come swarming up the staircases in the central path,\ngesticulating and shouting. He could not hear what they shouted. He was\nstruck again by the evident existence of a vulgar dialect among the\npoor of the city. When at last he descended, his guards were immediately\nsurrounded by a dense excited crowd. Afterwards it occurred to him that\nsome had attempted to reach him with petitions. His guards cleared a\npassage for him with difficulty.\n\nHe found an aeropile in charge of an aeronaut awaiting him on the\nwestward stage. Seen close this mechanism was no longer small. As it lay\non its launching carrier upon the wide expanse of the flying stage, its\naluminium body skeleton was as big as the hull of a twenty-ton yacht.\nIts lateral supporting sails braced and stayed with metal nerves\nalmost like the nerves of a bee's wing, and made of some sort of glassy\nartificial membrane, cast their shadow over many hundreds of square\nyards. The chairs for the engineer and his passenger hung free to swing\nby a complex tackle, within the protecting ribs of the frame and well\nabaft the middle. The passenger's chair was protected by a wind-guard\nand guarded about with metallic rods carrying air cushions. It could,\nif desired, be completely closed in, but Graham was anxious for novel\nexperiences, and desired that it should be left open. The aeronaut\nsat behind a glass that sheltered his face. The passenger could secure\nhimself firmly in his seat, and this was almost unavoidable on landing,\nor he could move along by means of a little rail and rod to a locker\nat the stem of the machine, where his personal luggage, his wraps and\nrestoratives were placed, and which also with the seats, served as a\nmakeweight to the parts of the central engine that projected to the\npropeller at the stern.\n\nThe engine was very simple in appearance. Asano, pointing out the\nparts of this apparatus to him, told him that, like the gas-engine of\nVictorian days, it was of the explosive type, burning a small drop of\na substance called \"fomile\" at each stroke. It consisted simply of\nreservoir and piston about the long fluted crank of the propeller shaft.\nSo much Graham saw of the machine.\n\nThe flying stage about him was empty save for Asano and their suite of\nattendants. Directed by the aeronaut he placed himself in his seat. He\nthen drank a mixture containing ergot--a dose, he learnt, invariably\nadministered to those about to fly, and designed to counteract the\npossible effect of diminished air pressure upon the system. Having done\nso, he declared himself ready for the journey. Asano took the empty\nglass from him, stepped through the bars of the hull, and stood below on\nthe stage waving his hand. Suddenly he seemed to slide along the stage\nto the right and vanish.\n\nThe engine was beating, the propeller spinning, and for a second the\nstage and the buildings beyond were gliding swiftly and horizontally\npast Graham's eye; then these things seemed to tilt up abruptly. He\ngripped the little rods on either side of him instinctively. He felt\nhimself moving upward, heard the air whistle over the top of the\nwind screen. The propeller screw moved round with powerful rhythmic\nimpulses--one, two, three, pause; one, two, three--which the engineer\ncontrolled very delicately. The machine began a quivering vibration that\ncontinued throughout the flight, and the roof areas seemed running away\nto starboard very quickly and growing rapidly smaller. He looked from\nthe face of the engineer through the ribs of the machine. Looking\nsideways, there was nothing very startling in what he saw--a rapid\nfunicular railway might have given the same sensations. He recognised\nthe Council House and the Highgate Ridge. And then he looked straight\ndown between his feet.\n\nFor a moment physical terror possessed him, a passionate sense of\ninsecurity. He held tight. For a second or so he could not lift his\neyes. Some hundred feet or more sheer below him was one of the big\nwindvanes of south-west London, and beyond it the southernmost flying\nstage crowded with little black dots. These things seemed to be falling\naway from him. For a second he had an impulse to pursue the earth. He\nset his teeth, he lifted his eyes by a muscular effort, and the moment\nof panic passed.\n\nHe remained for a space with his teeth set hard, his eyes staring into\nthe sky. Throb, throb, throb--beat, went the engine; throb, throb,\nthrob,--beat. He gripped his bars tightly, glanced at the aeronaut, and\nsaw a smile upon his sun-tanned face. He smiled in return--perhaps a\nlittle artificially. \"A little strange at first,\" he shouted before he\nrecalled his dignity. But he dared not look down again for some time.\nHe stared over the aeronaut's head to where a rim of vague blue horizon\ncrept up the sky. For a little while he could not banish the thought\nof possible accidents from his mind. Throb, throb, throb--beat; suppose\nsome trivial screw went wrong in that supporting engine! Suppose--! He\nmade a grim effort to dismiss all such suppositions. After a while they\ndid at least abandon the foreground of his thoughts. And up he went\nsteadily, higher and higher into the clear air.\n\nOnce the mental shock of moving unsupported through the air was\nover, his sensations ceased to be unpleasant, became very speedily\npleasurable. He had been warned of air sickness. But he found the\npulsating movement of the aeropile as it drove up the faint south-west\nbreeze was very little in excess of the pitching of a boat head on to\nbroad rollers in a moderate gale, and he was constitutionally a good\nsailor. And the keenness of the more rarefied air into which they\nascended produced a sense of lightness and exhilaration. He looked up\nand saw the blue sky above fretted with cirrus clouds. His eye came\ncautiously down through the ribs and bars to a shining flight of white\nbirds that hung in the lower sky. For a space he watched these. Then\ngoing lower and less apprehensively, he saw the slender figure of\nthe Wind-Vane keeper's crow's nest shining golden in the sunlight and\ngrowing smaller every moment. As his eye fell with more confidence now,\nthere came a blue line of hills, and then London, already to leeward,\nan intricate space of roofing. Its near edge came sharp and clear, and\nbanished his last apprehensions in a shock of surprise. For the boundary\nof London was like a wall, like a cliff, a steep fall of three or four\nhundred feet, a frontage broken only by terraces here and there, a\ncomplex decorative facade.\n\nThat gradual passage of town into country through an extensive sponge\nof suburbs, which was so characteristic a feature of the great cities of\nthe nineteenth century, existed no longer. Nothing remained of it but\na waste of ruins here, variegated and dense with thickets of the\nheterogeneous growths that had once adorned the gardens of the belt,\ninterspersed among levelled brown patches of sown ground, and verdant\nstretches of winter greens. The latter even spread among the vestiges\nof houses. But for the most part the reefs and skerries of ruins, the\nwreckage of suburban villas, stood among their streets and roads, queer\nislands amidst the levelled expanses of green and brown, abandoned\nindeed by the inhabitants years since, but too substantial, it seemed',\nto be cleared out of the way of the wholesale horticultural mechanisms\nof the time.\n\nThe vegetation of this waste undulated and frothed amidst the countless\ncells of crumbling house walls, and broke along the foot of the city\nwall in a surf of bramble and holly and ivy and teazle and tall grasses.\nHere and there gaudy pleasure palaces towered amidst the puny remains\nof Victorian times, and cable ways slanted to them from the city. That\nwinter day they seemed deserted. Deserted, too, were the artificial\ngardens among the ruins. The city limits were indeed as sharply defined\nas in the ancient days when the gates were shut at nightfall and the\nrobber foreman prowled to the very walls. A huge semi-circular throat\npoured out a vigorous traffic upon the Eadhamite Bath Road. So the first\nprospect of the world beyond the city flashed on Graham, and dwindled.\nAnd when at last he could look vertically downward again, he saw below\nhim the vegetable fields of the Thames valley--innumerable minute\noblongs of ruddy brown, intersected by shining threads, the sewage\nditches.\n\nHis exhilaration increased rapidly, became a sort of intoxication. He\nfound himself drawing deep breaths of air, laughing aloud, desiring\nto shout. After a time that desire became too strong for him, and he\nshouted.\n\nThe machine had now risen as high as was customary with aeropiles, and\nthey began to curve about towards the south. Steering, Graham perceived,\nwas effected by the opening or closing of one or two thin strips of\nmembrane in one or other of the otherwise rigid wings, and by the\nmovement of the whole engine backward or forward along its supports. The\naeronaut set the engine gliding slowly forward along its rail and\nopened the valve of the leeward wing until the stem of the aeropile was\nhorizontal and pointing southward. And in that direction they drove with\na slight list to leeward, and with a slow alternation of movement, first\na short, sharp ascent and then a long downward glide that was very\nswift and pleasing. During these downward glides the propellor was\ninactive altogether. These ascents gave Graham a glorious sense of\nsuccessful effort; the descents through the rarefied air were beyond all\nexperience. He wanted never to leave the upper air again.\n\nFor a time he was intent upon the minute details of the landscape that\nran swiftly northward beneath him. Its minute, clear detail pleased him\nexceedingly. He was impressed by the ruin of the houses that had once\ndotted the country, by the vast treeless expanse of country from which\nall farms and villages had gone, save for crumbling ruins. He had known\nthe thing was so, but seeing it so was an altogether different matter.\nHe tried to make out places he had known within the hollow basin of\nthe world below, but at first he could distinguish no data now that the\nThames valley was left behind. Soon, however, they were driving over a\nsharp chalk hill that he recognised as the Guildford Hog's Back, because\nof the familiar outline of the gorge at its eastward end, and because of\nthe ruins of the town that rose steeply on either lip of this gorge.\nAnd from that he made out other points, Leith Hill, the sandy wastes\nof Aldershot, and so forth. The Downs escarpment was set with gigantic\nslow-moving wind-wheels. Save where the broad Eadhamite Portsmouth\nRoad, thickly dotted with rushing shapes, followed the course of the old\nrailway, the gorge of the Wey was choked with thickets.\n\nThe whole expanse of the Downs escarpment, so far as the grey haze\npermitted him to see, was set with wind-wheels to which the largest of\nthe city was but a younger brother. They stirred with a stately motion\nbefore the south-west wind. And here and there were patches dotted\nwith the sheep of the British Food Trust, and here and there a mounted\nshepherd made a spot of black. Then rushing under the stern of the\naeropile came the Wealden Heights, the line of Hindhead, Pitch Hill, and\nLeith Hill, with a second row of wind-wheels that seemed striving to rob\nthe downland whirlers of their share of breeze. The purple heather was\nspeckled with yellow gorse, and on the further side a drove of black\noxen stampeded before a couple of mounted men. Swiftly these swept\nbehind, and dwindled and lost colour, and became scarce moving specks\nthat were swallowed up in haze.\n\nAnd when these had vanished in the distance Graham heard a peewit\nwailing close at hand. He perceived he was now above the South Downs,\nand staring over his shoulder saw the battlements of Portsmouth Landing\nStage towering over the ridge of Portsdown Hill. In another moment there\ncame into sight a spread of shipping like floating cities, the little\nwhite cliffs of the Needles dwarfed and sunlit, and the grey and\nglittering waters of the narrow sea. They seemed to leap the Solent in\na moment, and in a few seconds the Isle of Wight was running past, and\nthen beneath him spread a wider and wide extent of sea, here purple with\nthe shadow of a cloud, here grey, here a burnished mirror, and here\na spread of cloudy greenish blue. The Isle of Wight grew smaller and\nsmaller. In a few more minutes a strip of grey haze detached itself from\nother strips that were clouds, descended out of the sky and became a\ncoastline--sunlit and pleasant--the coast of northern France. It rose,\nit took colour, became definite and detailed, and the counterpart of the\nDownland of England was speeding by below.\n\nIn a little time, as it seemed, Paris came above the horizon, and hung\nthere for a space, and sank out of sight again as the aeropile circled\nabout to the north again. But he perceived the Eiffel Tower still\nstanding, and beside it a huge dome surmounted by a pinpoint Colossus.\nAnd he perceived, too, though he did not understand it at the time, a\nslanting drift of smoke. The aeronaut said something about \"trouble in\nthe underways,\" that Graham did not heed at the time. But he marked the\nminarets and towers and slender masses that streamed skyward above the\ncity windvanes, and knew that in the matter of grace at least Paris\nstill kept in front of her larger rival. And even as he looked a pale\nblue shape ascended very swiftly from the city like a dead leaf driving\nup before a gale. It curved round and soared towards them growing\nrapidly larger and larger. The aeronaut was saying something. \"What?\"\nsaid Graham, loath to take his eyes from this. \"Aeroplane, Sire,\" bawled\nthe aeronaut pointing.\n\nThey rose and curved about northward as it drew nearer. Nearer it came\nand nearer, larger and larger. The throb, throb, throb--beat, of the\naeropile's flight, that had seemed so potent and so swift, suddenly\nappeared slow by comparison with this tremendous rush. How great the\nmonster seemed, how swift and steady! It passed quite closely beneath\nthem, driving along silently, a vast spread of wirenetted translucent\nwings, a thing alive. Graham had a momentary glimpse of the rows and\nrows of wrapped-up passengers, slung in their little cradles behind\nwind-screens, of a white-clothed engineer crawling against the gale\nalong a ladder way, of spouting engines beating together, of the\nwhirling wind screw, and of a wide waste of wing. He exulted in the\nsight. And in an instant the thing had passed.\n\nIt rose slightly and their own little wings swayed in the rush of its\nflight. It fell and grew smaller. Scarcely had they moved, as it seemed,\nbefore it was again only a flat blue thing that dwindled in the sky.\nThis was the aeroplane that went to and fro between London and Paris. In\nfair weather and in peaceful times it came and went four times a day.\n\nThey beat across the Channel, slowly as it seemed now, to Graham's\nenlarged ideas, and Beachy Head rose greyly to the left of them.\n\n\"Land,\" called the aeronaut, his voice small against the whistling of\nthe air over the wind-screen.\n\n\"Not yet,\" bawled Graham, laughing. \"Not land yet. I want to learn more\nof this machine.\"\n\n\"I meant--\" said the aeronaut.\n\n\"I want to learn more of this machine,\" repeated Graham.\n\n\"I'm coming to you,\" he said, and had flung himself free of his chair\nand taken a step along the guarded rail between them. He stopped for a\nmoment, and his colour changed and his hands tightened. Another step and\nhe was clinging close to the aeronaut. He felt a weight on his shoulder,\nthe pressure of the air. His hat was a whirling speck behind. The wind\ncame in gusts over his wind-screen and blew his hair in streamers past\nhis cheek. The aeronaut made some hasty adjustments for the shifting of\nthe centres of gravity and pressure.\n\n\"I want to have these things explained,\" said Graham. \"What do you do\nwhen you move that engine forward?\"\n\nThe aeronaut hesitated. Then he answered, \"They are complex, Sire.\"\n\n\"I don't mind,\" shouted Graham. \"I don't mind.\"\n\nThere was a moment's pause. \"Aeronautics is the secret--the privilege--\"\n\n\"I know. But I'm the Master, and I mean to know.\" He laughed, full of\nthis novel realisation of power that was his gift from the upper air.\n\nThe aeropile curved about, and the keen fresh wind cut across Graham's\nface and his garment lugged at his body as the stem pointed round to the\nwest. The two men looked into each other's eyes.\n\n\"Sire, there are rules--\"\n\n\"Not where I am concerned,\" said Graham. \"You seem to forget.\"\n\nThe aeronaut scrutinised his face. \"No,\" he said. \"I do not forget,\nSire. But in all the earth--no man who is not a sworn aeronaut--has ever\na chance. They come as passengers--\"\n\n\"I have heard something of the sort. But I'm not going to argue these\npoints. Do you know why I have slept two hundred years? To fly!\"\n\n\"Sire,\" said the aeronaut, \"the rules--if I break the rules--\"\n\nGraham waved the penalties aside.\n\n\"Then if you will watch me--\"\n\n\"No,\" said Graham, swaying and gripping tight as the machine lifted its\nnose again for an ascent. \"That's not my game. I want to do it myself.\nDo it myself if I smash for it! No! I will. See. I am going to clamber\nby this to come and share your seat. Steady! I mean to fly of my own\naccord if I smash at the end of it. I will have something to pay for\nmy sleep. Of all other things--. In my past it was my dream to fly.\nNow--keep your balance.\"\n\n\"A dozen spies are watching me, Sire!\"\n\nGraham's temper was at end. Perhaps he chose it should be. He swore.\nHe swung himself round the intervening mass of levers and the aeropile\nswayed.\n\n\"Am I Master of the earth?\" he said. \"Or is your Society? Now. Take your\nhands off those levers, and hold my wrists. Yes--so. And now, how do we\nturn her nose down to the glide?\"\n\n\"Sire,\" said the aeronaut.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"You will protect me?\"\n\n\"Lord! Yes! If I have to burn London. Now!\"\n\nAnd with that promise Graham bought his first lesson in aerial\nnavigation. \"It's clearly to your advantage, this journey,\" he said with\na loud laugh--for the air was like strong wine--\"to teach me quickly and\nwell. Do I pull this? Ah! So! Hullo!\"\n\n\"Back, Sire! Back!\"\n\n\"Back--right. One--two--three--good God! Ah! Up she goes! But this is\nliving!\"\n\nAnd now the machine began to dance the strangest figures in the air. Now\nit would sweep round a spiral of scarcely a hundred yards diameter, now\nit would rush up into the air and swoop down again, steeply, swiftly,\nfalling like a hawk, to recover in a rushing loop that swept it high\nagain. In one of these descents it seemed driving straight at the\ndrifting park of balloons in the southeast, and only curved about\nand cleared them by a sudden recovery of dexterity. The extraordinary\nswiftness and smoothness of the motion, the extraordinary effect of the\nrarefied air upon his constitution, threw Graham into a careless fury.\n\nBut at last a queer incident came to sober him, to send him flying down\nonce more to the crowded life below with all its dark insoluble riddles.\nAs he swooped, came a tap and something flying past, and a drop like a\ndrop of rain. Then as he went on down he saw something like a white rag\nwhirling down in his wake. \"What was that?\" he asked. \"I did not see.\"\n\nThe aeronaut glanced, and then clutched at the lever to recover, for\nthey were sweeping down. When the aeropile was rising again he drew a\ndeep breath and replied. \"That,\" and he indicated the white thing still\nfluttering down, \"was a swan.\"\n\n\"I never saw it,\" said Graham.\n\nThe aeronaut made no answer, and Graham saw little drops upon his\nforehead.\n\nThey drove horizontally while Graham clambered back to the passenger's\nplace out of the lash of the wind. And then came a swift rush down,\nwith the wind-screw whirling to check their fall, and the flying stage\ngrowing broad and dark before them. The sun, sinking over the chalk\nhills in the west, fell with them, and left the sky a blaze of gold.\n\nSoon men could be seen as little specks. He heard a noise coming up to\nmeet him, a noise like the sound of waves upon a pebbly beach, and\nsaw that the roofs about the flying stage were dark with his people\nrejoicing over his safe return. A dark mass was crushed together under\nthe stage, a darkness stippled with innumerable faces, and quivering\nwith the minute oscillation of waved white handkerchiefs and waving\nhands.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. THREE DAYS\n\nLincoln awaited Graham in an apartment beneath the flying stages. He\nseemed curious to learn all that had happened, pleased to hear of the\nextraordinary delight and interest which Graham took in flying Graham\nwas in a mood of enthusiasm. \"I must learn to fly,\" he cried. \"I\nmust master that. I pity all poor souls who have died without this\nopportunity. The sweet swift air! It is the most wonderful experience in\nthe world.\"\n\n\"You will find our new times full of wonderful experiences,\" said\nLincoln. \"I do not know what you will care to do now. We have music that\nmay seem novel.\"\n\n\"For the present,\" said Graham, \"flying holds me. Let me learn more of\nthat. Your aeronaut was saying there is some trades union objection to\none's learning.\"\n\n\"There is, I believe,\" said Lincoln. \"But for you--! If you would'\nlike to occupy yourself with that, we can make you a sworn aeronaut\ntomorrow.\"\n\nGraham expressed his wishes vividly and talked of his sensations for a\nwhile. \"And as for affairs,\" he asked abruptly. \"How are things going\non?\"\n\nLincoln waved affairs aside. \"Ostrog will tell you that tomorrow,\" he\nsaid. \"Everything is settling down. The Revolution accomplishes itself\nall over the world. Friction is inevitable here and there, of course;\nbut your rule is assured. You may rest secure with things in Ostrog's\nhands.\"\n\n\"Would it be possible for me to be made a sworn aeronaut, as you call\nit, forthwith--before I sleep?\" said Graham, pacing. \"Then I could be at\nit the very first thing tomorrow again.\n\n\"It would be possible,\" said Lincoln thoughtfully. \"Quite possible.\nIndeed, it shall be done.\" He laughed. \"I came prepared to suggest\namusements, but you have found one for yourself. I will telephone to the\naeronautical offices from here and we will return to your apartments in\nthe Wind-Vane Control. By the time you have dined the aeronauts will\nbe able to come. You don't think that after you have dined, you might\nprefer--?\" He paused.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Graham.\n\n\"We had prepared a show of dancers--they have been brought from the\nCapri theatre.\"\n\n\"I hate ballets,\" said Graham, shortly. \"Always did. That other--.\nThat's not what I want to see. We had dancers in the old days. For the\nmatter of that, they had them in ancient Egypt. But flying--\"\n\n\"True,\" said Lincoln. \"Though our dancers--\"\n\n\"They can afford to wait,\" said Graham; \"they can afford to wait.\nI know. I'm not a Latin. There's questions I want to ask some\nexpert--about your machinery. I'm keen. I want no distractions.\"\n\n\"You have the world to choose from,\" said Lincoln; \"whatever you want is\nyours.\"\n\nAsano appeared, and under the escort of a strong guard they returned\nthrough the city streets to Graham's apartments. Far larger crowds had\nassembled to witness his return than his departure had gathered, and\nthe shouts and cheering of these masses of people sometimes drowned\nLincoln's answers to the endless questions Graham's aerial journey had\nsuggested. At first Graham had acknowledged the cheering and cries\nof the crowd by bows and gestures, but Lincoln warned him that such a\nrecognition would be considered incorrect behaviour. Graham, already\na little wearied by rhythmic civilities, ignored his subjects for the\nremainder of his public progress.\n\nDirectly they arrived at his apartments Asano departed in search\nof kinematographic renderings of machinery in motion, and Lincoln\ndespatched Graham's commands for models of machines and small machines\nto illustrate the various mechanical advances of the last two centuries.\nThe little group of appliances for telegraphic communication attracted\nthe Master so strongly that his delightfully prepared dinner, served by\na number of charmingly dexterous girls, waited for a space. The habit\nof smoking had almost ceased from the face of the earth, but when he\nexpressed a wish for that indulgence, inquiries were made and some\nexcellent cigars were discovered in Florida, and sent to him by\npneumatic dispatch while the dinner was still in progress. Afterwards\ncame the aeronauts, and a feast of ingenious wonders in the hands of a\nlatter-day engineer. For the time, at any rate, the neat dexterity of\ncounting and numbering machines, building machines, spinning engines,\npatent doorways, explosive motors, grain and water elevators,\nslaughter-house machines and harvesting appliances, was more fascinating\nto Graham than any bayadere. \"We were savages,\" was his refrain, \"we\nwere savages. We were in the stone age--compared with this.... And what\nelse have you?\"\n\nThere came also practical psychologists with some very interesting\ndevelopments in the art of hypnotism. The names of Milne Bramwell,\nFechner, Liebault, William James, Myers and Gurney, he found, bore\na value now that would have astonished their contemporaries. Several\npractical applications of psychology were now in general use; it had\nlargely superseded drugs, antiseptics and anaesthetics in medicine; was\nemployed by almost all who had any need of mental concentration. A\nreal enlargement of human faculty seemed to have been effected in this\ndirection. The feats of \"calculating boys,\" the wonders, as Graham had\nbeen wont to regard them, of mesmerisers, were now within the range of\nanyone who could afford the services of a skilled hypnotist. Long ago\nthe old examination methods in education had been destroyed by these\nexpedients. Instead of years of study, candidates had substituted a few\nweeks of trances, and during the trances expert coaches had simply\nto repeat all the points necessary for adequate answering, adding a\nsuggestion of the post hypnotic recollection of these points. In process\nmathematics particularly, this aid had been of singular service, and it\nwas now invariably invoked by such players of chess and games of manual\ndexterity as were still to be found. In fact, all operations conducted\nunder finite rules, of a quasi-mechanical sort that is, were now\nsystematically relieved from the wanderings of imagination and emotion,\nand brought to an unexampled pitch of accuracy. Little children of\nthe labouring classes, so soon as they were of sufficient age to\nbe hypnotised, were thus converted into beautifully punctual and\ntrustworthy machine minders, and released forthwith from the long, long\nthoughts of youth. Aeronautical pupils, who gave way to giddiness,\ncould be relieved from their imaginary terrors. In every street were\nhypnotists ready to print permanent memories upon the mind. If anyone\ndesired to remember a name, a series of numbers, a song or a speech, it\ncould be done by this method, and conversely memories could be effaced,\nhabits removed, and desires eradicated--a sort of psychic surgery was,\nin fact, in general use. Indignities, humbling experiences, were thus\nforgotten, amorous widows would obliterate their previous husbands,\nangry lovers release themselves from their slavery. To graft desires,\nhowever, was still impossible, and the facts of thought transference\nwere yet unsystematised. The psychologists illustrated their expositions\nwith some astounding experiments in mnemonics made through the agency of\na troupe of pale-faced children in blue.\n\nGraham, like most of the people of his former time, distrusted the\nhypnotist, or he might then and there have eased his mind of many\npainful preoccupations. But in spite of Lincoln's assurances he held to\nthe old theory that to be hypnotised was in some way the surrender of\nhis personality, the abdication of his will. At the banquet of wonderful\nexperiences that was beginning, he wanted very keenly to remain\nabsolutely himself.\n\nThe next day, and another day, and yet another day passed in such\ninterests as these. Each day Graham spent many hours in the glorious\nentertainment of flying. On the third day he soared across middle\nFrance, and within sight of the snow-clad Alps. These vigorous exercises\ngave him restful sleep, and each day saw a great stride in his health\nfrom the spiritless anaemia of his first awakening. And whenever he was\nnot in the air, and awake, Lincoln was assiduous in the cause of his\namusement; all that was novel and curious in contemporary invention was\nbrought to him, until at last his appetite for novelty was well-nigh\nglutted. One might fill a dozen inconsecutive volumes with the strange\nthings they exhibited. Each afternoon he held his court for an hour\nor so. He speedily found his interest in his contemporaries becoming\npersonal and intimate. At first he had been alert chiefly for\nunfamiliarity and peculiarity; any foppishness in their dress, any\ndiscordance with his preconceptions of nobility in their status and\nmanners had jarred upon him, and it was remarkable to him how soon that\nstrangeness and the faint hostility that arose from it, disappeared; how\nsoon he came to appreciate the true perspective of his position, and see\nthe old Victorian days remote and quaint. He found himself particularly\namused by the red-haired daughter of the Manager of the European\nPiggeries. On the second day after dinner he made the acquaintance of a\nlatter-day dancing girl, and found her an astonishing artist. And after\nthat, more hypnotic wonders. On the third day Lincoln was moved to\nsuggest that the Master should repair to a Pleasure City, but this\nGraham declined, nor would he accept the services of the hypnotists in\nhis aeronautical experiments. The link of locality held him to London;\nhe found a perpetual wonder in topographical identifications that he\nwould have missed abroad. \"Here--or a hundred feet below here,\" he could\nsay, \"I used to eat my midday cutlets during my London University\ndays. Underneath here was Waterloo and the perpetual hunt for confusing\ntrains. Often have I stood waiting down there, bag in hand, and stared\nup into the sky above the forest of signals, little thinking I should\nwalk some day a hundred yards in the air. And now in that very sky that\nwas once a grey smoke canopy, I circle in an aeropile.\"\n\nDuring those three days Graham was so occupied with such distractions\nthat the vast political movements in progress outside his quarters had\nbut a small share of his attention. Those about him told him little.\nDaily came Ostrog, the Boss, his Grand Vizier, his mayor of the palace,\nto report in vague terms the steady establishment of his rule; \"a little\ntrouble\" soon to be settled in this city, \"a slight disturbance\" in\nthat. The song of the social revolt came to him no more; he never\nlearned that it had been forbidden in the municipal limits; and all the\ngreat emotions of the crow's nest slumbered in his mind.\n\nBut on the second and third of the three days he found himself, in spite\nof his interest in the daughter of the Pig Manager, or it may be by,\nreason of the thoughts her conversation suggested, remembering the girl\nHelen Wotton, who had spoken to him so oddly at the Wind-Vane Keeper's\ngathering. The impression she had made was a deep one, albeit the\nincessant surprise of novel circumstances had kept him from brooding\nupon it for a space. But now her memory was coming to its own. He\nwondered what she had meant by those broken half-forgotten sentences;\nthe picture of her eyes and the earnest passion of her face became more\nvivid as his mechanical interests faded. Her beauty came compellingly\nbetween him and certain immediate temptations of ignoble passion. But he\ndid not see her again until three full days were past.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII. GRAHAM REMEMBERS\n\nShe came upon him at last in a little gallery that ran from the Wind\nVane Offices toward his state apartments. The gallery was long and\nnarrow, with a series of recesses, each with an arched fenestration that\nlooked upon a court of palms. He came upon her suddenly in one of\nthese recesses. She was seated. She turned her head at the sound of\nhis footsteps and started at the sight of him. Every touch of colour\nvanished from her face. She rose instantly, made a step toward him as\nif to address him, and hesitated. He stopped and stood still, expectant.\nThen he perceived that a nervous tumult silenced her, perceived too,\nthat she must have sought speech with him to be waiting for him in this\nplace.\n\nHe felt a regal impulse to assist her. \"I have wanted to see you,\" he\nsaid. \"A few days ago you wanted to tell me something--you wanted to\ntell me of the people. What was it you had to tell me?\"\n\nShe looked at him with troubled eyes.\n\n\"You said the people were unhappy?\"\n\nFor a moment she was silent still.\n\n\"It must have seemed strange to you,\" she said abruptly.\n\n\"It did. And yet--\"\n\n\"It was an impulse.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"That is all.\"\n\nShe looked at him with a face of hesitation. She spoke with an effort.\n\"You forget,\" she said, drawing a deep breath.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The people--\"\n\n\"Do you mean--?\"\n\n\"You forget the people.\"\n\nHe looked interrogative.\n\n\"Yes. I know you are surprised. For you do not understand what you are.\nYou do not know the things that are happening.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"You do not understand.\"\n\n\"Not clearly, perhaps. But--tell me.\"\n\nShe turned to him with sudden resolution. \"It is so hard to explain. I\nhave meant to, I have wanted to. And now--I cannot. I am not ready with\nwords. But about you--there is something. It is Wonder. Your sleep--your\nawakening. These things are miracles. To me at least--and to all the\ncommon people. You who lived and suffered and died, you who were a\ncommon citizen, wake again, live again, to find yourself Master almost\nof the earth.\"\n\n\"Master of the earth,\" he said. \"So they tell me. But try and imagine\nhow little I know of it.\"\n\n\"Cities--Trusts--the Labour Company--\"\n\n\"Principalities, powers, dominions--the power and the glory. Yes, I have\nheard them shout. I know. I am Master. King, if you wish. With Ostrog,\nthe Boss--\"\n\nHe paused.\n\nShe turned upon him and surveyed his face with a curious scrutiny.\n\"Well?\"\n\nHe smiled. \"To take the responsibility.\"\n\n\"That is what we have begun to fear.\" For a moment she said no more.\n\"No,\" she said slowly. \"You will take the responsibility. You will take\nthe responsibility. The people look to you.\"\n\nShe spoke softly. \"Listen! For at least half the years of your sleep--in\nevery generation--multitudes of people, in every generation greater\nmultitudes of people, have prayed that you might awake--prayed.\"\n\nGraham moved to speak and did not.\n\nShe hesitated, and a faint colour crept back to her cheek. \"Do you know\nthat you have been to myriads--King Arthur, Barbarossa--the King who\nwould come in his own good time and put the world right for them?\"\n\n\"I suppose the imagination of the people--\"\n\n\"Have you not heard our proverb, 'When the Sleeper wakes?' While you lay\ninsensible and motionless there--thousands came. Thousands. Every first\nof the month you lay in state with a white robe upon you and the people\nfiled by you. When I was a little girl I saw you like that, with your\nface white and calm.\"\n\nShe turned her face from him and looked steadfastly at the painted wall\nbefore her. Her voice fell. \"When I was a little girl I used to look\nat your face....it seemed to me fixed and waiting, like the patience of\nGod.\"\n\n\"That is what we thought of you,\" she said. \"That is how you seemed to\nus.\"\n\nShe turned shining eyes to him, her voice was clear and strong. \"In the\ncity, in the earth, a myriad myriad men and women are waiting to see\nwhat you will do, full of strange incredible expectations.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Ostrog--no one--can take that responsibility.\"\n\nGraham looked at her in surprise, at her face lit with emotion. She\nseemed at first to have spoken with an effort, and to have fired herself\nby speaking.\n\n\"Do you think,\" she said, \"that you who have lived that little life so\nfar away in the past, you who have fallen into and risen out of this\nmiracle of sleep--do you think that the wonder and reverence and hope\nof half the world has gathered about you only that you may live another\nlittle life?... That you may shift the responsibility to any other man?\"\n\n\"I know how great this kingship of mine is,\" he said haltingly. \"I know\nhow great it seems. But is it real? It is incredible--dreamlike. Is it\nreal, or is it only a great delusion?\"\n\n\"It is real,\" she said; \"if you dare.\"\n\n\"After all, like all kingship, my kingship is Belief. It is an illusion\nin the minds of men.\"\n\n\"If you dare!\" she said.\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\n\n\"Countless men,\" she said, \"and while it is in their minds--they will\nobey.\"\n\n\"But I know nothing. That is what I had in mind. I know nothing. And\nthese others--the Councillors, Ostrog. They are wiser, cooler, they know\nso much, every detail. And, indeed, what are these miseries of which you\nspeak? What am I to know? Do you mean--\"\n\nHe stopped blankly.\n\n\"I am still hardly more than a girl,\" she said. \"But to me the world\nseems full of wretchedness. The world has altered since your day,\naltered very strangely. I have prayed that I might see you and tell you\nthese things. The world has changed. As if a canker had seized it--and\nrobbed life of--everything worth having.\"\n\nShe turned a flushed face upon him, moving suddenly. \"Your days were the\ndays of freedom. Yes--I have thought. I have been made to think, for my\nlife--has not been happy. Men are no longer free--no greater, no better\nthan the men of your time. That is not all. This city--is a prison.\nEvery city now is a prison. Mammon grips the key in his hand. Myriads,\ncountless myriads, toil from the cradle to the grave. Is that right? Is\nthat to be--for ever? Yes, far worse than in your time. All about us,\nbeneath us, sorrow and pain. All the shallow delight of such life as\nyou find about you, is separated by just a little from a life of\nwretchedness beyond any telling Yes, the poor know it--they know they\nsuffer. These countless multitudes who faced death for you two nights\nsince--! You owe your life to them.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Graham, slowly. \"Yes. I owe my life to them.\"\n\n\"You come,\" she said, \"from the days when this new tyranny of the cities\nwas scarcely beginning. It is a tyranny--a tyranny. In your days the\nfeudal war lords had gone, and the new lordship of wealth had still\nto come. Half the men in the world still lived out upon the free\ncountryside. The cities had still to devour them. I have heard the\nstories out of the old books--there was nobility! Common men led lives\nof love and faithfulness then--they did a thousand things. And you--you\ncome from that time.\"\n\n\"It was not--. But never mind. How is it now--?\"\n\n\"Gain and the Pleasure Cities! Or slavery--unthanked, unhonoured,\nslavery.\"\n\n\"Slavery!\" he said.\n\n\"Slavery.\"\n\n\"You don't mean to say that human beings are chattels.\"\n\n\"Worse. That is what I want you to know, what I want you to see. I know\nyou do not know. They will keep things from you, they will take you\npresently to a Pleasure City. But you have noticed men and women and\nchildren in pale blue canvas, with thin yellow faces and dull eyes?\"\n\n\"Everywhere.\"\n\n\"Speaking a horrible dialect, coarse and weak.\"\n\n\"I have heard it.\"\n\n\"They are the slaves--your slaves. They are the slaves of the Labour\nCompany you own.\"\n\n\"The Labour Company! In some way--that is familiar. Ah! now I remember.\nI saw it when I was wandering about the city, after the lights returned,\ngreat fronts of buildings coloured pale blue. Do you really mean--?\"\n\n\"Yes. How can I explain it to you? Of course the blue uniform struck\nyou. Nearly a third of our people wear it--more assume it now every day.\nThis Labour Company has grown imperceptibly.\"\n\n\"What is this Labour Company?\" asked Graham.\n\n\"In the old times, how did you manage with starving people?\"\n\n\"There was the workhouse--which the parishes maintained.\"\n\n\"Workhouse! Yes--there was something. In our history lessons. I remember\nnow. The Labour Company ousted the workhouse. It grew--partly--out\nof something--you, perhaps, may remember it--an emotional religious\norganisation called the Salvation Army--that became a business company.\nIn the first place it was almost a charity. To save people from\nworkhouse rigours. Now I come to think of it, it was one of the earliest\nproperties your Trustees acquired. They bought the Salvation Army and\nreconstructed it as this. The idea in the first place was to give work\nto starving homeless people.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Nowadays there are no workhouses, no refuges and charities, nothing but\nthat Company. Its offices are everywhere. That blue is its colour.\nAnd any man, woman or child who comes to be hungry and weary and with\nneither home nor friend nor resort, must go to the Company in the\nend--or seek some way of death. The Euthanasy is beyond their means--for\nthe poor there is no easy death. And at any hour in the day or night\nthere is food, shelter and a blue uniform for all comers--that is the\nfirst condition of the Company's incorporation--and in return for a\nday's shelter the Company extracts a day's work, and then returns the\nvisitor's proper clothing and sends him or her out again.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Perhaps that does not seem so terrible to you. In your days men starved\nin your streets. That was bad. But they died--men. These people in\nblue--. The proverb runs: 'Blue canvas once and ever.' The Company\ntrades in their labour, and it has taken care to assure itself of the\nsupply. People come to it starving and helpless--they eat and sleep for\na night and day, they--work for a day, and at the end of the day they go\nout again. If they have worked well they have a penny or so--enough\nfor a theatre or a cheap dancing place, or a kinematograph story, or\na dinner or a bet. They wander about after that is spent. Begging is\nprevented by the police of the ways. Besides, no one gives. They come\nback again the next day or the day after--brought back by the same\nincapacity that brought them first. At last their proper clothing wears\nout, or their rags get so shabby that they are ashamed. Then they must\nwork for months to get fresh. If they want fresh. A great number of\nchildren are born under the Company's care. The mother owes them a\nmonth thereafter--the children they cherish and educate until they\nare fourteen, and they pay two years' service. You may be sure these\nchildren are educated for the blue canvas. And so it is the Company\nworks.\"\n\n\"And none are destitute in the city?\"\n\n\"None. They are either in blue canvas or in prison.\"\n\n\"If they will not work?\"\n\n\"Most people will work at that pitch, and the Company has powers. There\nare stages of unpleasantness in the work--stoppage of food--and a man or\nwoman who has refused to work once is known by a thumb-marking system\nin the Company's offices all over the world. Besides, who can leave the\ncity poor? To go to Paris costs two Lions. And for insubordination\nthere are the prisons--dark and miserable--out of sight below. There are\nprisons now for many things.\"\n\n\"And a third of the people wear this blue canvas?\"\n\n\"More than a third. Toilers, living without pride or delight or hope,\nwith the stories of Pleasure Cities ringing in their ears, mocking their\nshameful lives, their privations and hardships. Too poor even for the\nEuthanasy, the rich man's refuge from life. Dumb, crippled millions,\ncountless millions, all the world about, ignorant of anything but\nlimitations and unsatisfied desires. They are born, they are thwarted\nand they die. That is the state to which we have come.\"\n\nFor a space Graham sat downcast.\n\n\"But there has been a revolution,\" he said. \"All these things will be\nchanged.\" Ostrog--\"\n\n\"That is our hope. That is the hope of the world. But Ostrog will not\ndo it. He is a politician. To him it seems things must be like this.\nHe does not mind. He takes it for granted. All the rich, all the\ninfluential, all who are happy, come at last to take these miseries for\ngranted. They use the people in their politics, they live in ease by\ntheir degradation. But you--you who come from a happier age--it is to\nyou the people look. To you.\"\n\nHe looked at her face. Her eyes were bright with unshed tears. He felt\na rush of emotion. For a moment he forgot this city, he forgot the race,\nand all those vague remote voices, in the immediate humanity of her\nbeauty.\n\n\"But what am I to do?\" he said with his eyes upon her.\n\n\"Rule,\" she answered, bending towards him and speaking in a low tone.\n\"Rule the world as it has never been ruled, for the good and happiness\nof men. For you might rule it--you could rule it.\n\n\"The people are stirring. All over the world the people are stirring. It\nwants but a word--but a word from you--to bring them all together. Even\nthe middle sort of people are restless unhappy.\n\n\"They are not telling you the things that are happening. The people will\nnot go back to their drudgery--they refuse to be disarmed. Ostrog has\nawakened something greater than he dreamt of--he has awakened hopes.\"\n\nHis heart was beating fast. He tried to seem judicial, to weigh\nconsiderations.\n\n\"They only want their leader,\" she said.\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"You could do what you would;--the world is yours.\"\n\nHe sat, no longer regarding her. Presently he spoke. \"The old dreams,\nand the thing I have dreamt, liberty, happiness. Are they dreams? Could\none man--one man--?\" His voice sank and ceased.\n\n\"Not one man, but all men--give them only a leader to speak the desire\nof their hearts.\"\n\nHe shook his head, and for a time there was silence.\n\nHe looked up suddenly, and their eyes met. \"I have not your faith,\"\nhe said. \"I have not your youth. I am here with power that mocks me.\nNo--let me speak. I want to do--not right--I have not the strength\nfor that--but something rather right than wrong. It will bring no\nmillennium, but I am resolved now that I will rule. What you have said\nhas awakened me.... You are right. Ostrog must know his place. And I\nwill learn--.... One thing I promise you. This Labour slavery shall\nend.\"\n\n\"And you will rule?\"\n\n\"Yes. Provided--. There is one thing.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"That you will help me.\"\n\n\"I!--a girl!\"\n\n\"Yes. Does it not occur to you I am absolutely alone?\"\n\nShe started and for an instant her eyes had pity. \"Need you ask whether\nI will help you?\" she said.\n\nShe stood before him, beautiful, worshipful, and her enthusiasm and the\ngreatness of their theme was like a great gulf fixed between them. To\ntouch her, to clasp her hand, was a thing beyond hope. \"Then I will rule\nindeed,\" he said slowly. \"I will rule-\" He paused. \"With you.\"\n\nThere came a tense silence, and then the beating a clock striking the\nhour. She made him no answer. Graham rose.\n\n\"Even now,\" he said, \"Ostrog will be waiting.\" He hesitated, facing her.\n\"When I have asked him certain questions--. There is much I do not know.\nIt may be, that I will go to see with my own eyes the things of which\nyou have spoken. And when I return--?\"\n\n\"I shall know of your going and coming. I will wait for you here again.\"\n\nHe stood for a moment regarding her.\n\n\"I knew,\" she said, and stopped.\n\nHe waited, but she said no more. They regarded one another steadfastly,\nquestioningly, and then he turned from her towards the Wind Vane office.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX. OSTROG'S POINT OF VIEW\n\nGraham found Ostrog waiting to give a formal account of his day's\nstewardship. On previous occasions he had passed over this ceremony as\nspeedily as possible, in order to resume his aerial experiences, but now\nhe began to ask quick short questions. He was very anxious to take\nup his empire forthwith. Ostrog brought flattering reports of the\ndevelopment of affairs abroad. In Paris and Berlin, Graham perceived\nthat he was saying, there had been trouble, not organised resistance\nindeed, but insubordinate proceedings. \"After all these years,\" said\nOstrog, when Graham pressed enquiries, \"the Commune has lifted its head\nagain. That is the real nature of the struggle, to be explicit.\" But\norder had been restored in these cities. Graham, the more deliberately\njudicial for the stirring emotions he felt, asked if there had been\nany fighting. \"A little,\" said Ostrog. \"In one quarter only. But the\nSenegalese division of our African agricultural police--the Consolidated\nAfrican Companies have a very well drilled police--was ready, and so\nwere the aeroplanes. We expected a little trouble in the continental\ncities, and in America. But things are very quiet in America. They are\nsatisfied with the overthrow of the Council. For the time.\"\n\n\n\"Why should you expect trouble?\" asked Graham abruptly.\n\n\"There is a lot of discontent--social discontent.\"\n\n\"The Labour Company?\"\n\n\"You are learning,\" said Ostrog with a touch of surprise. \"Yes. It is\nchiefly the discontent with the Labour Company. It was that discontent\nsupplied the motive force of this overthrow--that and your awakening.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\nOstrog smiled. He became explicit. \"We had to stir up their discontent,\nwe had to revive the old ideals of universal happiness--all men\nequal--all men happy--no luxury that everyone may not share--ideas that\nhave slumbered for two hundred years. You know that? We had to revive\nthese ideals, impossible as they are--in order to overthrow the Council.\nAnd now--\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Our revolution is accomplished, and the Council is overthrown, and\npeople whom we have stirred up remain surging. There was scarcely\nenough fighting... We made promises, of course. It is extraordinary how\nviolently and rapidly this vague out-of-date humanitarianism has revived\nand spread. We who sowed the seed even, have been astonished. In Paris,\nas I say--we have had to call in a little external help.\"\n\n\"And here?\"\n\n\"There is trouble. Multitudes will not go back to work. There is a\ngeneral strike. Half the factories are empty and the people are swarming\nin the Ways. They are talking of a Commune. Men in silk and satin have\nbeen insulted in the streets. The blue canvas is expecting all sorts of\nthings from you.... Of course there is no need for you to trouble. We\nare setting the Babble Machines to work with counter suggestions in the\ncause of law and order. We must keep the grip tight; that is all.\"\n\nGraham thought. He perceived a way of asserting himself. But he spoke\nwith restraint.\n\n\"Even to the pitch of bringing a negro police,\" he said.\n\n\"They are useful,\" said Ostrog. \"They are fine loyal brutes, with no\nwash of ideas in their heads--such as our rabble has. The Council\nshould have had them as police of the Ways, and things might have\nbeen different. Of course, there is nothing to fear except rioting and\nwreckage. You can manage your own wings now, and you can soar away to\nCapri if there is any smoke or fuss. We have the pull of all the great\nthings; the aeronauts are privileged and rich, the closest trades union\nin the world, and so are the engineers of the wind vanes. We have the\nair, and the mastery of the air is the mastery of the earth. No one of\nany ability is organising against us. They have no leaders--only the\nsectional leaders of the secret society we organised before your very\nopportune awakening. Mere busy bodies and sentimentalists they are and\nbitterly jealous of each other. None of them is man enough for a\ncentral figure. The only trouble will be a disorganised upheaval. To\nbe frank--that may happen. But it won't interrupt your aeronautics. The\ndays when the People could make revolutions are past.\"\n\n\"I suppose they are,\" said Graham. \"I suppose they are.\" He mused. \"This\nworld of yours has been full of surprises to me. In the old days we\ndreamt of a wonderful democratic life, of a time when all men would be\nequal and happy.\"\n\nOstrog looked at him steadfastly. \"The day of democracy is past,\" he\nsaid. \"Past for ever. That day began with the bowmen of Crecy, it ended\nwhen marching infantry, when common men in masses ceased to win the\nbattles of the world, when costly cannon, great ironclads, and strategic\nrailways became the means of power. To-day is the day of wealth. Wealth\nnow is power as it never was power before--it commands earth and sea and\nsky. All power is for those who can handle wealth.... You must accept\nfacts, and these are facts. The world for the Crowd! The Crowd as Ruler!\nEven in your days that creed had been tried and condemned. To-day it has\nonly one believer--a multiplex, silly one--the mall in the Crowd.\"\n\nGraham did not answer immediately. He stood lost in sombre\npreoccupations.\n\n\"No,\" said Ostrog. \"The day of the common man is past. On the open\ncountryside one man is as good as another, or nearly as good. The\nearlier aristocracy had a precarious tenure of strength and audacity.\nThey were tempered--tempered. There were insurrections, duels, riots.\nThe first real aristocracy, the first permanent aristocracy, came in\nwith castles and armour, and vanished before the musket and bow. But\nthis is the second aristocracy. The real one. Those days of gunpowder\nand democracy were only an eddy in the stream. The common man now is a\nhelpless unit. In these days we have this great machine of the city, and\nan organisation complex beyond his understanding.\"\n\n\"Yet,\" said Graham, \"there is something resists, something you are\nholding down--something that stirs and presses.\"\n\n\"You will see,\" said Ostrog, with a forced smile that would brush these\ndifficult questions aside. \"I have not roused the force to destroy\nmyself--trust me.\"\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Graham.\n\nOstrog stared.\n\n\"Must the world go this way?\" said Graham, with his emotions at the\nspeaking point. \"Must it indeed go in this way? Have all our hopes been\nvain?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" said Ostrog. \"Hopes?\"\n\n\"I came from a democratic age. And I find an aristocratic tyranny!\"\n\n\"Well,--but you are the chief tyrant.\"\n\nGraham shook his head.\n\n\"Well,\" said Ostrog, \"take the general question. It is the way that\nchange has always travelled. Aristocracy, the prevalence of the\nbest--the suffering and extinction of the unfit, and so to better\nthings.\"\n\n\"But aristocracy! those people I met--\"\n\n\"Oh! not those!\" said Ostrog. \"But for the most part they go to their\ndeath. Vice and pleasure! They have no children. That sort of stuff will\ndie out. If the world keeps to one road, that is, if there is no turning\nback. An easy road to excess, convenient Euthanasia for the pleasure\nseekers singed in the flame, that is the way to improve the race!\"\n\n\"Pleasant extinction,\" said Graham. \"Yet--.\" He thought for an instant.\n\"There is that other thing--the Crowd, the great mass of poor men. Will\nthat die out? That will not die out. And it suffers, its suffering is a\nforce that even you--\"\n\nOstrog moved impatiently, and when he spoke, he spoke rather less evenly\nthan before.\n\n\"Don't you trouble about these things,\" he said. \"Everything will be\nsettled in a few days now. The Crowd is a huge foolish beast. What if\nit does not die out? Even if it does not die, it can still be tamed\nand driven. I have no sympathy with servile men. You heard those people\nshouting and singing two nights ago. They were taught that song. If you\nhad taken any man there in cold blood and asked why he shouted, he could\nnot have told you. They think they are shouting for you, that they are\nloyal and devoted to you. Just then they were ready to slaughter the\nCouncil. To-day--they are already murmuring against those who have\noverthrown the Council.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said Graham. \"They shouted because their lives were dreary,\nwithout joy or pride, and because in me--in me--they hoped.\"\n\n\"And what was their hope? What is their hope? What right have they to\nhope? They work ill and they want the reward of those who work well. The\nhope of mankind--what is it? That some day the Over-man may come,\nthat some day the inferior, the weak and the bestial may be subdued or\neliminated. Subdued if not eliminated. The world is no place for the\nbad, the stupid, the enervated. Their duty--it's a fine duty too!--is to\ndie. The death of the failure! That is the path by which the beast rose\nto manhood, by which man goes on to higher things.\"\n\nOstrog took a pace, seemed to think, and turned on Graham. \"I can\nimagine how this great world state of ours seems to a Victorian\nEnglishman. You regret all the old forms of representative\ngovernment--their spectres still haunt the world, the voting councils\nand parliaments and all that eighteenth century tomfoolery You feel\nmoved against our Pleasure Cities. I might have thought of that,--had\nI not been busy. But you will learn better. The people are mad with\nenvy--they would be in sympathy with you. Even in the streets now, they\nclamour to destroy the Pleasure Cities. But the Pleasure Cities are the\nexcretory organs of the State, attractive places that year after year\ndraw together all that is weak and vicious, all that is lascivious and\nlazy, all the easy roguery of the world, to a graceful destruction. They\ngo there, they have their time, they die childless, all the pretty silly\nlascivious women die childless, and mankind is the better. If the people\nwere sane they would not envy the rich their way of death. And you would\nemancipate the silly brainless workers that we have enslaved, and try to\nmake their lives easy and pleasant again. Just as they have sunk to what\nthey are fit for.\" He smiled a smile that irritated Graham oddly. \"You\nwill learn better. I know those ideas; in my boyhood I read your Shelley\nand dreamt of Liberty. There is no liberty, save wisdom and self\ncontrol. Liberty is within--not without. It is each man's own affair.\nSuppose--which is impossible--that these swarming yelping fools in blue\nget the upper hand of us, what then? They will only fall to other\nmasters. So long as there are sheep Nature will insist on beasts of\nprey. It would mean but a few hundred years' delay. The coming of the\naristocrat is fatal and assured. The end will be the Over-man--for all\nthe mad protests of humanity. Let them revolt, let them win and kill me\nand my like. Others will arise--other masters. The end will be the\nsame.\"\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Graham doggedly.\n\nFor a moment he stood downcast.\n\n\"But I must see these things for myself,\" he said, suddenly assuming\na tone of confident mastery. \"Only by seeing can I understand. I must\nlearn. That is what I want to tell you, Ostrog. I do not want to be King\nin a Pleasure City; that is not my, pleasure. I have spent enough time\nwith aeronautics--and those other things. I must learn how people live\nnow, how the common life has developed. Then I shall understand these\nthings better. I must learn how common people live--the labour people\nmore especially--how they work, marry, bear children, die--\"\n\n\"You get that from our realistic novelists,\" suggested Ostrog, suddenly\npreoccupied.\n\n\"I want reality,\" said Graham, \"not realism.\"\n\n\"There are difficulties,\" said Ostrog, and thought.\n\n\"On the whole perhaps--\n\n\"I did not expect--.\n\n\"I had thought--. And yet, perhaps--. You say you want to go through the\nWays of the city and see the common people.\"\n\nSuddenly he came to some conclusion. \"You would need to go disguised,\"\nhe said. \"The city is intensely excited, and the discovery of your\npresence among them might create a fearful tumult. Still this wish of\nyours to go into this city--this idea of yours--. Yes, now I think the\nthing over it seems to me not altogether--. It can be contrived. If you\nwould really find an interest in that! You are, of course, Master. You\ncan go soon if you like. A disguise for this excursion Asano will be\nable to manage. He would go with you. After all it is not a bad idea of\nyours.\"\n\n\"You will not want to consult me in any matter?\" asked Graham suddenly,\nstruck by an odd suspicion.\n\n\"Oh, dear no! No! I think you may trust affairs to me for a time, at any\nrate,\" said Ostrog, smiling. \"Even if we differ--\"\n\nGraham glanced; at him sharply.\n\n\"There is no fighting likely to happen soon?\" he asked abruptly.\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"I have been thinking about these negroes. I don't believe the people\nintend any hostility to me, and, after all, I am the Master. I do not\nwant any negroes brought to London. It is an archaic prejudice perhaps,\nbut I have peculiar feelings about Europeans and the subject races. Even\nabout Paris--\"\n\nOstrog stood watching him from under his drooping brows. \"I am not\nbringing negroes to London,\" he said slowly. \"But if--\"\n\n\"You are not to bring armed negroes to London, whatever happens,\" said\nGraham. \"In that matter I am quite decided.\"\n\nOstrog, after a pause, decided not to speak, and bowed deferentially.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX. IN THE CITY WAYS\n\nAnd that night, unknown and unsuspected, Graham, dressed in the costume\nof an inferior wind-vane official keeping holiday, and accompanied by\nAsano in Labour Company canvas, surveyed the city through which he\nhad wandered when it was veiled in darkness. But now he saw it lit and\nwaking, a whirlpool of life. In spite of the surging and swaying of the\nforces of revolution, in spite of the unusual discontent, the mutterings\nof the greater struggle of which the first revolt was but the prelude,\nthe myriad streams of commerce still flowed wide and strong. He knew now\nsomething of the dimensions and quality of the new age, but he was not\nprepared for the infinite surprise of the detailed view, for the torrent\nof colour and vivid impressions that poured past him.\n\nThis was his first real contact with the people of these latter days.\nHe realised that all that had gone before, saving his glimpses of the\npublic theatres and markets, had had its element of seclusion, had been\na movement within the comparatively narrow political quarter, that all\nhis previous experiences had revolved immediately about the question of\nhis own position. But here was the city at the busiest hours of night,\nthe people to a large extent returned to their own immediate interests,\nthe resumption of the real informal life, he common habits of the new\ntime.\n\nThey emerged at first into a street whose opposite ways were crowded\nwith the blue canvas liveries. This swarm Graham saw was a portion of a\nprocession--it was odd to see a procession parading the city seated They\ncarried banners of coarse red stuff with red letters. \"No disarmament,\"\nsaid the banners, for the most part in crudely daubed letters and\nwith variant spelling, and \"Why should we disarm?\" \"No disarming.\" \"No\ndisarming.\" Banner after banner went by, a stream of banners flowing\npast, and at last at the end, the song of the revolt and a noisy band of\nstrange instruments. \"They all ought to be at work,\" said Asano. \"They\nhave had no food these two days, or they have stolen it.\"\n\nPresently Asano made a detour to avoid the congested crowd that gaped\nupon the occasional passage of dead bodies from hospital to a mortuary,\nthe gleanings after death's harvest of the first revolt.\n\nThat night few people were sleeping, everyone was abroad. A vast\nexcitement, perpetual crowds perpetually changing, surrounded Graham;\nhis mind was confused and darkened by an incessant tumult, by the cries\nand enigmatical fragments of the social struggle that was as yet\nonly beginning. Everywhere festoons and banners of black and strange\ndecorations, intensified the quality of his popularity. Everywhere he\ncaught snatches of that crude thick dialect that served the illiterate\nclass, the class, that is, beyond the reach of phonograph culture, in\ntheir common-place intercourse. Everywhere this trouble of disarmament\nwas in the air, with a quality of immediate stress of which he had no\ninkling during his seclusion in the Wind-Vane quarter. He perceived that\nas soon as he returned he must discuss this with Ostrog, this and the\ngreater issues of which it was the expression, in a far more conclusive\nway than he had so far done. Perpetually that night, even in the earlier\nhours of their wanderings about the city, the spirit of unrest and\nrevolt swamped his attention, to the exclusion of countless strange\nthings he might otherwise have observed.\n\nThis preoccupation made his impressions fragmentary. Yet amidst so much\nthat was strange and vivid, no subject, however personal and insistent,\ncould exert undivided sway. There were spaces when the revolutionary\nmovement passed clean out of his mind, was drawn aside like a curtain\nfrom before some startling new aspect of the time. Helen had swayed his\nmind to this intense earnestness of enquiry, but there came times when\nshe, even, receded beyond his conscious thoughts. At one moment, for\nexample, he found they were traversing the religious quarter, for\nthe easy transit about the city afforded by the moving ways rendered\nsporadic churches and chapels no longer necessary--and his attention was\nvividly arrested by the facade of one of the Christian sects.\n\nThey were travelling seated on one of the swift upper ways, the place\nleapt upon them at a bend and advanced rapidly towards them. It was\ncovered with inscriptions from top to base, in vivid white and blue,\nsave where a vast and glaring kinematograph transparency presented a\nrealistic New Testament scene, and where a vast festoon of black to show\nthat the popular religion followed the popular politics, hung across the\nlettering Graham had already become familiar with the phonotype writing\nand these inscriptions arrested him, being to his sense for the\nmost part almost incredible blasphemy. Among the less offensive were\n\"Salvation on the First Floor and turn to the Right.\" \"Put your Money on\nyour Maker.\" \"The Sharpest Conversion in London, Expert Operators! Look\nSlippy!\" \"What Christ would say to the Sleeper;--Join the Up-to-date\nSaints!\" \"Be a Christian--without hindrance to your present Occupation.\"\n\"All the Brightest Bishops on the Bench to-night and Prices as Usual.\"\n\"Brisk Blessings for Busy Business Men.\"\n\n\"But this is appalling!\" said Graham, as that deafening scream of\nmercantile piety towered above them.\n\n\"What is appalling?\" asked his little officer, apparently seeking vainly\nfor anything unusual in this shrieking enamel.\n\n\"_This!_ Surely the essence of religion is reverence.\"\n\n\"Oh _that!_\" Asano looked at Graham. \"Does it shock you?\" he said in the\ntone of one who makes a discovery. \"I suppose it would, of course. I had\nforgotten. Nowadays the competition for attention is so keen, and people\nsimply haven't the leisure to attend to their souls, you know, as they\nused to do.\" He smiled. \"In the old days you had quiet Sabbaths and the\ncountryside. Though somewhere I've read of Sunday afternoons that--\"\n\n\"But, _that_,\" said Graham, glancing back at the receding blue and\nwhite. \"That is surely not the only--\"\n\n\"There are hundreds of different ways. But, of course, if a sect doesn't\ntell it doesn't pay. Worship has moved with the times. There are high\nclass sects with quieter ways--costly incense and personal attentions\nand all that. These people are extremely popular and prosperous. They\npay several dozen lions for those apartments to the Council--to you, I\nshould say.\"\n\nGraham still felt a difficulty with the coinage, and this mention of\na dozen lions brought him abruptly to that matter. In a moment the\nscreaming temples and their swarming touts were forgotten in this new\ninterest. A turn of a phrase suggested, and an answer confirmed the idea\nthat gold and silver were both demonetised, that stamped gold which had\nbegun its reign amidst the merchants of Phoenicia was at last dethroned.\nThe change had been graduated but swift, brought about by an extension\nof the system of cheques that had even in his previous life already\npractically superseded gold in all the larger business transactions. The\ncommon traffic of the city, the common currency indeed of all the world,\nwas conducted by means of the little brown, green and pink council\ncheques for small amounts, printed with a blank payee. Asano had several\nwith him, and at the first opportunity he supplied the gaps in his\nset. They were printed not on tearable paper, but on a semi-transparent\nfabric of silken, flexibility, interwoven with silk. Across them all\nsprawled a facsimile of Graham's signature, his first encounter with the\ncurves and turns of that familiar autograph for two hundred and three\nyears.\n\nSome intermediary experiences made no impression sufficiently vivid to\nprevent the matter of the disarmament claiming his thoughts again;\na blurred picture of a Theosophist temple that promised MIRACLES in\nenormous letters of unsteady fire was least submerged perhaps, but\nthen came the view of the dining hall in Northumberland Avenue. That\ninterested him very greatly.\n\nBy the energy and thought of Asano he was able to view this place from\na little screened gallery reserved for the attendants of the tables. The\nbuilding was pervaded by a distant muffled hooting, piping and bawling,\nof which he did not at first understand the import, but which recalled\na certain mysterious leathery voice he had heard after the resumption of\nthe lights on the night of his solitary wandering.\n\nHe had grown accustomed now to vastness and great numbers of people,\nnevertheless this spectacle held him for a long time. It was as he\nwatched the table service more immediately beneath, and interspersed\nwith many questions and answers concerning details, that the realisation\nof the full significance of the feast of several thousand people came to\nhim.\n\n\nIt was his constant surprise to find that points that one might have\nexpected to strike vividly at the very outset never occurred to him\nuntil some trivial detail suddenly shaped as a riddle and pointed to the\nobvious thing he had overlooked. In this matter, for instance, it had\nnot occurred to him that this continuity of the city, this exclusion of\nweather, these vast halls and ways, involved the disappearance of the\nhousehold; that the typical Victorian \"home,\" the little brick cell\ncontaining kitchen and scullery, living rooms and bedrooms, had, save\nfor the ruins that diversified the countryside, vanished as surely as\nthe wattle hut. But now he saw what had indeed been manifest from\nthe first, that London, regarded as a living place, was no longer an\naggregation of houses but a prodigious hotel, an hotel with a thousand\nclasses of accommodation, thousands of dining halls, chapels, theatres,\nmarkets and places of assembly, a synthesis of enterprises, of which he\nchiefly was the owner. People had their sleeping rooms, with, it might\nbe, antechambers, rooms that were always sanitary at least whatever the\ndegree of comfort and privacy, and for the rest they lived much as many\npeople had lived in the new-made giant hotels of the Victorian days,\neating, reading, thinking, playing, conversing, all in places of public\nresort, going to their work in the industrial quarters of the city or\ndoing business in their offices in the trading section.\n\nHe perceived at once how necessarily this state of affairs had developed\nfrom the Victorian city. The fundamental reason for the modern city had\never been the economy of co-operation. The chief thing to prevent the\nmerging of the separate households in his own generation was simply the\nstill imperfect civilisation of the people, the strong barbaric pride,\npassions, and prejudices, the jealousies, rivalries, and violence of the\nmiddle and lower classes, which had necessitated the entire separation\nof contiguous households. But the change, the taming of the people, had\nbeen in rapid progress even then. In his brief thirty years of previous\nlife he had seen an enormous extension of the habit of consuming meals\nfrom home, the casually patronised horse-box coffee-house had given\nplace to the open and crowded Aerated Bread Shop for instance, women's\nclubs had had their beginning, and an immense development of reading\nrooms, lounges and libraries had witnessed to the growth of social\nconfidence. These promises had by this time attained to their complete\nfulfillment. The locked and barred household had passed away.\n\nThese people below him belonged, he learnt, to the lower middle class,\nthe class just above the blue labourers, a class so accustomed in the\nVictorian period to feed with every precaution of privacy that its\nmembers, when occasion confronted them with a public meal, would\nusually hide their embarrassment under horseplay or a markedly militant\ndemeanour. But these gaily, if lightly dressed people below, albeit\nvivacious, hurried and uncommunicative, were dexterously mannered and\ncertainly quite at their ease with regard to one another.\n\nHe noted a slight significant thing; the table, as far as he could see,\nwas and remained delightfully neat, there was nothing to parallel the\nconfusion, the broadcast crumbs, the splashes of viand and condiment,\nthe overturned drink and displaced ornaments, which would have marked\nthe stormy progress of the Victorian meal. The table furniture was\nvery different. There were no ornaments, no flowers, and the table was\nwithout a cloth, being made, he learnt, of a solid substance having\nthe texture and appearance of damask. He discerned that this damask\nsubstance was patterned with gracefully designed trade advertisements.\n\nIn a sort of recess before each diner was a complete apparatus of\nporcelain and metal. There was one plate of white porcelain, and by\nmeans of taps for hot and cold volatile fluids the diner washed this\nhimself between the courses; he also washed his elegant white metal\nknife and fork and spoon as occasion required.\n\nSoup and the chemical wine that was the common drink were delivered\nby similar taps, and the remaining covers travelled automatically in\ntastefully arranged dishes down the table along silver rails. The diner\nstopped these and helped himself at his discretion. They appeared at\na little door at one end of the table, and vanished at the other. That\nturn of democratic sentiment in decay, that ugly pride of menial souls,\nwhich renders equals loth to wait on one another, was very strong he\nfound among these people. He was so preoccupied with these details that\nit was only just as he was leaving the place that he remarked the huge\nadvertisement dioramas that marched majestically along the upper walls\nand proclaimed the most remarkable commodities.\n\nBeyond this place they came into a crowded hall, and he discovered the\ncause of the noise that had perplexed him. They paused at a turnstile at\nwhich a payment was made.\n\nGraham's attention was immediately arrested by a violent, loud hoot,\nfollowed by a vast leathery voice. \"The Master is sleeping peacefully,\"\nit said vociferately. \"He is in excellent health. He is going to devote\nthe rest of his life to aeronautics. He says women are more beautiful\nthan ever. Galloop! Wow! Our wonderful civilisation astonishes him\nbeyond measure. Beyond all measure. Galloop. He puts great trust in Boss\nOstrog, absolute confidence in Boss Ostrog. Ostrog is to be his chief\nminister; is authorised to remove or reinstate public officers--all\npatronage will be in his hands. All patronage in the hands of Boss\nOstrog! The Councillors have been sent back to their own prison above\nthe Council House.\"\n\nGraham stopped at the first sentence, and, looking up, beheld a\nfoolish trumpet face from which this was brayed. This was the General\nIntelligence Machine. For a space it seemed to be gathering breath,\nand a regular throbbing from its cylindrical body was audible. Then it\ntrumpeted \"Galloop, Galloop,\" and broke out again.\n\n\"Paris is now pacified. All resistance is over. Galloop! The black\npolice hold every position of importance in the city. They fought with\ngreat bravery, singing songs written in praise of their ancestors by\nthe poet Kipling. Once or twice they got out of hand, and tortured and\nmutilated wounded and captured insurgents, men and women. Moral--don't\ngo rebelling. Haha! Galloop, Galloop! They are lively fellows. Lively\nbrave fellows. Let this be a lesson to the disorderly banderlog of this\ncity. Yah! Banderlog! Filth of the earth! Galloop, Galloop!\"\n\nThe voice ceased. There was a confused murmur of disapproval among the\ncrowd. \"Damned niggers.\" A man began to harangue near them. \"Is this the\nMaster's doing, brothers? Is this the Master's doing?\"\n\n\"Black police!\" said Graham. \"What is that? You don't mean--\"\n\nAsano touched his arm and gave him a warning look, and forthwith another\nof these mechanisms screamed deafeningly and gave tongue in a shrill\nvoice. \"Yahaha, Yahah, Yap! Hear a live paper yelp! Live paper. Yaha!\nShocking outrage in Paris. Yahahah! The Parisians exasperated by the\nblack police to the pitch of assassination. Dreadful reprisals. Savage\ntimes come again. Blood! Blood! Yaha!\" The nearer Babble Machine hooted\nstupendously, \"Galloop, Galloop,\" drowned the end of the sentence, and\nproceeded in a rather flatter note than before with novel comments on\nthe horrors of disorder. \"Law and order must be maintained,\" said the\nnearer Babble Machine.\n\n\"But,\" began Graham.\n\n\"Don't ask questions here,\" said Asano, \"or you will be involved in an\nargument.\"\n\n\"Then let us go on,\" said Graham, \"for I want to know more of this.\"\n\nAs he and his companion pushed their way through the excited crowd that\nswarmed beneath these voices, towards the exit, Graham conceived more\nclearly the proportion and features of this room. Altogether, great\nand small, there must have been nearly a thousand of these erections,\npiping, hooting, bawling and gabbling in that great space, each with\nits crowd of excited listeners, the majority of them men dressed in blue\ncanvas. There were all sizes of machines, from the little gossipping\nmechanisms that chuckled out mechanical sarcasm in odd corners, through\na number of grades to such fifty-foot giants as that which had first\nhooted over Graham.\n\nThis place was unusually crowded, because of the intense public interest\nin the course of affairs in Paris. Evidently the struggle had been much\nmore savage than Ostrog had represented it. All the mechanisms were\ndiscoursing upon that topic, and the repetition of the people made the\nhuge hive buzz with such phrases as \"Lynched policemen,\" \"Women burnt\nalive,\" \"Fuzzy Wuzzy.\" \"But does the Master allow such things?\" asked a\nman near him. \"Is this the beginning of the Master's rule?\"\n\nIs _this_ the beginning of the Master's rule? For a long time after he\nhad left the place, the hooting, whistling and braying of the machines\npursued him; \"Galloop, Galloop,\" \"Yahahah, Yaha, Yap! Yaha!\" Is this the\nbeginning of the Master's rule?\n\nDirectly they were out upon the ways he began to question Asano closely\non the nature of the Parisian struggle. \"This disarmament! What was\ntheir trouble? What does it all mean?\" Asano seemed chiefly anxious to\nreassure him that it was \"all right.\" \"But these outrages!\" \"You cannot\nhave an omelette,\" said Asano, \"without breaking eggs. It is only the\nrough people. Only in one part of the city. All the rest is all right.\nThe Parisian labourers are the wildest in the world, except ours.\"\n\n\"What! the Londoners?\"\n\n\"No, the Japanese. They have to be kept in order.\" \"But burning women\nalive!\"\n\n\"A Commune!\" said Asano. \"They would rob you of your property. They\nwould do away with property and give the world over to mob rule. You are\nMaster, the world is yours. But there will be no Commune here. There is\nno need for black police here.\n\n\"And every consideration has been shown. It is their own negroes--French\nspeaking negroes. Senegal regiments, and Niger and Timbuctoo.\"\n\n\"Regiments?\" said Graham, \"I thought there was only one--.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Asano, and glanced at him. \"There is more than one.\"\n\nGraham felt unpleasantly helpless.\n\n\"I did not think,\" he began and stopped abruptly He went off at a\ntangent to ask for information about these Babble Machines. For the most\npart, the crowd present had been shabbily or even raggedly dressed, and\nGraham learnt that so far as the more prosperous classes were concerned,\nin all the more comfortable private apartments of the city were fixed\nBabble Machines that would speak directly a lever was pulled. The tenant\nof the apartment could connect this with the cables of any of the great\nNews Syndicates that he preferred. When he learnt this presently, he\ndemanded the reason of their absence from his own suite of apartments.\nAsano stared. \"I never thought,\" he said. \"Ostrog must have had them\nremoved.\"\n\nGraham stared. \"How was I to know?\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"Perhaps he thought they would annoy you,\" said Asano.\n\n\"They must be replaced directly I return,\" said Graham after an\ninterval.\n\nHe found a difficulty in understanding that this news room and the\ndining hall were not great central places, that such establishments were\nrepeated almost beyond counting all over the city. But ever and again\nduring the night's expedition his ears, in some new quarter would pick\nout from the tumult of the ways the peculiar hooting of the organ of\nBoss Ostrog, \"Galloop, Galloop!\" or the shrill \"Yahaha, Yaha, Yap!--Hear\na live paper yelp!\" of its chief rival.\n\nRepeated, too, everywhere, were such _creches_ as the one he now\nentered. It was reached by a lift, and by a glass bridge that flung\nacross the dining hall and traversed the ways at a slight upward angle.\nTo enter the first section of the place necessitated the use of his\nsolvent signature under Asano's direction. They were immediately\nattended to by a man in a violet robe and gold clasp, the insignia of\npractising medical men. He perceived from this man's manner that his\nidentity was known, and proceeded to ask questions on the strange\narrangements of the place without reserve.\n\nOn either side of the passage, which was silent and padded, as if\nto deaden the footfall, were narrow little doors, their size and\narrangement suggestive of the cells of a Victorian prison. But the upper\nportion of each door was of the same greenish transparent stuff that\nhad enclosed him at his awakening, and within, dimly seen, lay, in every\ncase, a very young baby in a little nest of wadding. Elaborate apparatus\nwatched the atmosphere and rang a bell far away in the central office at\nthe slightest departure from the optimum of temperature and moisture. A\nsystem of such _creches_ had almost entirely replaced the hazardous\nadventures of the old-world nursing. The attendant presently called\nGraham's attention to the wet nurses, a vista of mechanical figures,\nwith arms, shoulders and breasts of astonishingly realistic modelling,\narticulation, and texture, but mere brass tripods below, and having in\nthe place of features a flat disc bearing advertisements likely to be of\ninterest to mothers.\n\nOf all the strange things that Graham came upon that night, none jarred\nmore upon his habits of thought than this place. The spectacle of the\nlittle pink creatures, their feeble limbs swaying uncertainly in vague\nfirst movements, left alone, without embrace or endearment, was wholly\nrepugnant to him. The attendant doctor was of a different opinion. His\nstatistical evidence showed beyond dispute that in the Victorian times\nthe most dangerous passage of life was the arms of the mother, that\nthere human mortality had ever been most terrible. On the other hand\nthis _creche_ company, the International Creche Syndicate, lost not\none-half per cent of the million babies or so that formed its peculiar\ncare. But Graham's prejudice was too strong even for those figures.\n\nAlong one of the many passages of the place they presently came upon a\nyoung couple in the usual blue canvas peering through the transparency\nand laughing hysterically at the bald head of their first-born. Graham's\nface must have showed his estimate of them, for their merriment ceased\nand they looked abashed. But this little incident accentuated his sudden\nrealisation of the gulf between his habits of thought and the ways of\nthe new age. He passed on to the crawling rooms and the Kindergarten,\nperplexed and distressed. He found the endless long playrooms were\nempty! the latter-day children at least still spent their nights in\nsleep. As they went through these, the little officer pointed out the\nnature of the toys, developments of those devised by that inspired\nsentimentalist Froebel. There were nurses here, but much was done by\nmachines that sang and danced and dandled.\n\nGraham was still not clear upon many points. \"But so many orphans,\" he\nsaid perplexed, reverting to a first misconception, and learnt again\nthat they were not orphans.\n\nSo soon as they had left the _creche_ he began to speak of the horror\nthe babies in their incubating cases had caused him. \"Is motherhood\ngone?\" he said. \"Was it a cant? Surely it was an instinct. This seems so\nunnatural--abominable almost.\"\n\n\"Along here we shall come to the dancing place,\" said Asano by way of\nreply. \"It is sure to be crowded. In spite of all the political unrest\nit will be crowded. The women take no great interest in politics--except\na few here and there. You will see the mothers--most young women in\nLondon are mothers. In that class it is considered a creditable thing to\nhave one child--a proof of animation. Few middle class people have more\nthan one. With the Labour Company it is different. As for motherhood\nThey still take an immense pride in the children. They come here to look\nat them quite often.\"\n\n\"Then do you mean that the population of the world--?\"\n\n\"Is falling? Yes. Except among the people under the Labour Company. They\nare reckless--.\"\n\nThe air was suddenly dancing with music, and down a way they approached\nobliquely, set with gorgeous pillars as it seemed of clear amethyst,\nflowed a concourse of gay people and a tumult of merry cries and\nlaughter. He saw curled heads, wreathed brows, and a happy intricate\nflutter of gamboge pass triumphant across the picture.\n\n\"You will see,\" said Asano with a faint smile \"The world has changed.\nIn a moment you will see the mothers of the new age. Come this way. We\nshall see those yonder again very soon.\"\n\nThey ascended a certain height in a swift lift, and changed to a slower\none. As they went on the music grew upon them, until it was near and\nfull and splendid, and, moving with its glorious intricacies they could\ndistinguish the beat of innumerable dancing feet. They made a payment\nat a turnstile, and emerged upon the wide gallery that overlooked the\ndancing place, and upon the full enchantment of sound and sight.\n\n\"Here,\" said Asano, \"are the fathers and mothers of the little ones you\nsaw.\"\n\nThe hall was not so richly decorated as that of the Atlas, but saving\nthat, it was, for its size, the most splendid Graham had seen. The\nbeautiful white limbed figures that supported the galleries reminded\nhim once more of the restored magnificence of sculpture; they seemed\nto writhe in engaging attitudes, their faces laughed. The source of the\nmusic that filled the place was hidden, and the whole vast shining floor\nwas thick with dancing couples. \"Look at them,\" said the little officer,\n\"see how much they show of motherhood.\"\n\nThe gallery they stood upon ran along the upper edge of a huge screen\nthat cut the dancing hall on one side from a sort of outer hall that\nshowed through broad arches the incessant onward rush of the city ways.\nIn this outer hall was a great crowd of less brilliantly dressed people,\nas numerous almost as those who danced within, the great majority\nwearing the blue uniform of the Labour Company that was now so familiar\nto Graham. Too poor to pass the turnstiles to the festival, they were\nyet unable to keep away from the sound of its seductions. Some of them\neven had cleared spaces, and were dancing also, fluttering their rags in\nthe air. Some shouted as they danced, jests and odd allusions Graham\ndid not understand. Once someone began whistling the refrain of the\nrevolutionary song, but it seemed as though that beginning was promptly\nsuppressed. The corner was dark and Graham could not see. He turned to\nthe hall again. Above the caryatidae were marble busts of men whom that\nage esteemed great moral emancipators and pioneers; for the most part\ntheir names were strange to Graham, though he recognised Grant Allen,\nLe Gallienne, Nietzsche, Shelley and Goodwin. Great black festoons\nand eloquent sentiments reinforced the huge inscription that partially\ndefaced the upper end of the dancing place, and asserted that \"The\nFestival of the Awakening\" was in progress.\n\n\"Myriads are taking holiday or staying from work because of that, quite\napart from the labourers who refuse to go back,\" said Asano. \"These\npeople are always ready for holidays.\"\n\nGraham walked to the parapet and stood leaning over, looking down at the\ndancers. Save for two or three remote whispering couples, who had stolen\napart, he and his guide had the gallery to themselves. A warm breath of\nscent and vitality came up to him. Both men and women below were lightly\nclad, bare-armed, open-necked, as the universal warmth of the city\npermitted. The hair of the men was often a mass of effeminate curls,\ntheir chins were always shaven, and many of them had flushed or coloured\ncheeks. Many of the women were very pretty, and all were dressed with\nelaborate coquetry. As they swept by beneath, he saw ecstatic faces with\neyes half closed in pleasure.\n\n\"What sort of people are these?\" he asked abruptly.\n\n\"Workers--prosperous workers. What you would have called the middle\nclass. Independent tradesmen with little separate businesses have\nvanished long ago, but there are store servers, managers, engineers of\na hundred sorts. Tonight is a holiday of course, and every dancing place\nin the city will be crowded, and every place of worship.\"\n\n\"But--the women?\"\n\n\"The same. There's a thousand forms of work for women now. But you had\nthe beginning of the independent working-woman in your days. Most women\nare independent now. Most of these are married more or less--there are\na number of methods of contract--and that gives them more money, and\nenables them to enjoy themselves.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Graham looking at the flushed faces, the flash and swirl\nof movement, and still thinking of that nightmare of pink helpless\nlimbs. \"And these are--mothers.\"\n\n\"Most of them.\"\n\n\"The more I see of these things the more complex I find your problems.\nThis, for instance, is a surprise. That news from Paris was a surprise.\"\n\nIn a little while he spoke again:\n\n\"These are mothers. Presently, I suppose, I shall get into the\nmodern way of seeing things. I have old habits of mind clinging about\nme--habits based, I suppose, on needs that are over and done with. Of\ncourse, in our time, a woman was supposed not only to bear children,\nbut to cherish them, to devote herself to them, to educate them--all\nthe essentials of moral and mental education a child owed its mother. Or\nwent without. Quite a number, I admit, went without. Nowadays, clearly,\nthere is no more need for such care than if they were butterflies. I see\nthat! Only there was an ideal--that figure of a grave, patient woman,\nsilently and serenely mistress of a home, mother and maker of men--to\nlove her was a sort of worship--\"\n\nHe stopped and repeated, \"A sort of worship.\"\n\n\"Ideals change,\" said the little man, \"as needs change.\"\n\nGraham awoke from an instant reverie and Asano repeated his words.\nGraham's mind returned to the thing at hand.\n\n\"Of course I see the perfect reasonableness of this Restraint,\nsoberness, the matured thought, the unselfish a act, they are\nnecessities of the barbarous state, the life of dangers. Dourness is\nman's tribute to unconquered nature. But man has conquered nature now\nfor all practical purposes--his political affairs are managed by Bosses\nwith a black police--and life is joyous.\"\n\nHe looked at the dancers again. \"Joyous,\" he said.\n\n\"There are weary moments,\" said the little officer, reflectively.\n\n\"They all look young. Down there I should be visibly the oldest man. And\nin my own time I should have passed as middle-aged.\"\n\n\"They are young. There are few old people in this class in the work\ncities.\"\n\n\"How is that?\"\n\n\"Old people's lives are not so pleasant as they used to be, unless they\nare rich to hire lovers and helpers. And we have an institution called\nEuthanasy.\"\n\n\"Ah! that Euthanasy!\" said Graham. \"The easy death?\"\n\n\"The easy death. It is the last pleasure. The Euthanasy Company does it\nwell. People will pay the sum--it is a costly thing--long beforehand,\ngo off to some pleasure city and return impoverished and weary, very\nweary.\"\n\n\"There is a lot left for me to understand,\" said Graham after a pause.\n\"Yet I see the logic of it all. Our array of angry virtues and sour\nrestraints was the consequence of danger and insecurity. The Stoic, the\nPuritan, even in my time, were vanishing types. In the old days man\nwas armed against Pain, now he is eager for Pleasure. There lies the\ndifference. Civilisation has driven pain and danger so far off--for\nwell-to-do people. And only well-to-do people matter now. I have been\nasleep two hundred years.\"\n\nFor a minute they leant on the balustrading, following the intricate\nevolution of the dance. Indeed the scene was very beautiful.\n\n\"Before God,\" said Graham, suddenly, \"I would rather be a wounded\nsentinel freezing in the snow than one of these painted fools!\"\n\n\"In the snow,\" said Asano, \"one might think differently.\"\n\n\"I am uncivilised,\" said Graham, not heeding him. \"That is the trouble.\nI am primitive--Palaeolithic. Their fountain of rage and fear and anger\nis sealed and closed, the habits of a lifetime make them cheerful and\neasy and delightful. You must bear with my nineteenth century shocks and\ndisgusts. These people, you say, are skilled workers and so forth. And\nwhile these dance, men are fighting--men are dying in Paris to keep the\nworld--that they may dance.\"\n\nAsano smiled faintly. \"For that matter, men are dying in London,\" he\nsaid.\n\nThere was a moment's silence.\n\n\"Where do these sleep?\" asked Graham.\n\n\"Above and below--an intricate warren.\"\n\n\"And where do they work? This is--the domestic life.\"\n\n\"You will see little work to-night. Half the workers are out or under\narms. Half these people are keeping holiday. But we will go to the work\nplaces if you wish it.\"\n\nFor a time Graham watched the dancers, then suddenly turned away. \"I\nwant to see the workers. I have seen enough of these,\" he said.\n\nAsano led the way along the gallery across the dancing hall. Presently\nthey came to a transverse passage that brought a breath of fresher,\ncolder air.\n\nAsano glanced at this passage as they went past, stopped, went back\nto it, and turned to Graham with a smile. \"Here, Sire,\" he said, \"is\nsomething--will be familiar to you at least--and yet--. But I will not\ntell you. Come!\"\n\nHe led the way along a closed passage that presently became cold. The\nreverberation of their feet told that this passage was a bridge. They\ncame into a circular gallery that was glazed in from the outer weather,\nand so reached a circular chamber which seemed familiar, though Graham\ncould not recall distinctly when he had entered it before. In this was a\nladder--the first ladder he had seen since his awakening--up which they\nwent, and came into a high, dark, cold place in which was another almost\nvertical ladder. This they ascended, Graham still perplexed.\n\nBut at the top he understood, and recognized the metallic bars to which\nhe clung. He was in the cage under the ball of St. Paul's. The dome rose\nbut a little way above the general contour of the city, into the still\ntwilight, and sloped away, shining greasily under a few distant lights,\ninto a circumambient ditch of darkness.\n\nOut between the bars he looked upon the wind-clear northern sky and saw\nthe starry constellations all unchanged. Capella hung in the west, Vega\nwas rising, and the seven glittering points of the Great Bear swept\noverhead in their stately circle about the Pole.\n\nHe saw these stars in a clear gap of sky. To the east and south the\ngreat circular shapes of complaining wind-wheels blotted out the\nheavens, so that the glare about the Council House was hidden. To the\nsouth-west hung Orion, showing like a pallid ghost through a tracery of\niron-work and interlacing shapes above a dazzling coruscation of lights.\nA bellowing and siren screaming that came from the flying stages warned\nthe world that one of the aeroplanes was ready to start. He remained for\na space gazing towards the glaring stage. Then his eyes went back to the\nnorthward constellations.\n\nFor a long time he was silent. \"This,\" he said at last, smiling in the\nshadow, \"seems the strangest thing of all. To stand in the dome of Saint\nPaul's and look once more upon these familiar, silent stars!\"\n\nThence Graham was taken by Asano along devious ways to the great\ngambling and business quarters where the bulk of the fortunes in the\ncity were lost and made. It impressed him as a well-nigh interminable\nseries of very high halls, surrounded by tiers upon tiers of galleries\ninto which opened thousands of offices, and traversed by a complicated\nmultitude of bridges, footways, aerial motor rails, and trapeze and\ncable leaps. And here more than anywhere the note of vehement vitality,\nof uncontrollable, hasty activity, rose high. Everywhere was violent\nadvertisement, until his brain swam at the tumult of light and colour.\nAnd Babble Machines of a peculiarly rancid tone were abundant and filled\nthe air with strenuous squealing and an idiotic slang. \"Skin your eyes\nand slide,\" \"Gewhoop, Bonanza,\" \"Gollipers come and hark!\"\n\nThe place seemed to him to be dense with people either profoundly\nagitated or swelling with obscure cunning, yet he learnt that the place\nwas comparatively empty, that the great political convulsion of the last\nfew days had reduced transactions to an unprecedented minimum. In one\nhuge place were long avenues of roulette tables, each with an excited,\nundignified crowd about it; in another a yelping Babel of white-faced\nwomen and red-necked leathery-lunged men bought and sold the shares of\nan absolutely fictitious business undertaking which, every five minutes,\npaid a dividend of ten per cent and cancelled a certain proportion of\nits shares by means of a lottery wheel.\n\nThese business activities were prosecuted with an energy that readily\npassed into violence, and Graham approaching a dense crowd found at its\ncentre a couple of prominent merchants in violent controversy with teeth\nand nails on some delicate point of business etiquette. Something still\nremained in life to be fought for. Further he had a shock at a vehement\nannouncement in phonetic letters of scarlet flame, each twice the height\nof a man, that \"WE ASSURE THE PROPRAIET'R. WE ASSURE THE PROPRAIET'R.\"\n\n\"Who's the proprietor?\" he asked.\n\n\"You.\"\n\n\n\n\"But what do they assure me?\" he asked. \"What do they assure me?\"\n\n\"Didn't you have assurance?\"\n\nGraham thought. \"Insurance?\"\n\n\"Yes--Insurance. I remember that was the older word. They are insuring\nyour life. Dozands of people are taking out policies, myriads of lions\nare being put on you. And further on other people are buying annuities.\nThey do that on everybody who is at all prominent. Look there!\"\n\nA crowd of people surged and roared, and Graham saw a vast black screen\nsuddenly illuminated in still larger letters of burning purple. \"Anuetes\non the Propraiet'r--x 5 pr. G.\" The people began to boo and shout\nat this, a number of hard breathing, wildeyed men came running past,\nclawing with hooked fingers at the air. There was a furious crush about\na little doorway.\n\nAsano did a brief calculation. \"Seventeen per cent per annum is their\nannuity on you. They would not pay so much per cent if they could see\nyou now, Sire. But they do not know. Your own annuities used to be a\nvery safe investment, but now you are sheer gambling, of course. This is\nprobably a desperate bid. I doubt if people will get their money.\"\n\nThe crowd of would-be annuitants grew so thick about them that for some\ntime they could move neither forward no backward. Graham noticed what\nappeared to him to be a high proportion of women among the speculators,\nand was reminded again of the economical independence of their sex. They\nseemed remarkably well able to take care of themselves in the crowd,\nusing their elbows with particular skill, as he learnt to his cost.\nOne curly-headed person caught in the pressure for a space, looked\nsteadfastly at him several times, almost as if she recognized him, and\nthen, edging deliberately towards him, touched his hand with her arm in\na scarcely accidental manner, and made it plain by a look as ancient as\nChaldea that he had found favour in her eyes. And then a lank,\ngrey-bearded man, perspiring copiously in a noble passion of self-help,\nblind to all earthly things save that glaring, bait, thrust between them\nin a cataclysmal rush towards that alluring \"x 5 pr. G.\"\n\n\"I want to get out of this,\" said Graham to Asano. \"This is not what\nI came to see. Show me the workers. I want to see the people in blue.\nThese parasitic lunatics--\"\n\nHe found himself wedged in a struggling mass of people, and this hopeful\nsentence went unfinished.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI. THE UNDER SIDE\n\nFrom the Business Quarter they presently passed by the running ways into\na remote quarter of the city, where the bulk of the manufactures was\ndone. On their way the platforms crossed the Thames twice, and passed in\na broad viaduct across one of the great roads that entered the city\nfrom the North. In both cases his impression was swift and in both\nvery vivid. The river was a broad wrinkled glitter of black sea water,\noverarched by buildings, and vanishing either way into a blackness\nstarred with receding lights. A string of black barges passed seaward,\nmanned by blue-clad men. The road was a long and very broad and high\ntunnel, along which big-wheeled machines drove noiselessly and swiftly.\nHere, too, the distinctive blue of the Labour Company was in abundance.\nThe smoothness of the double tracks, the largeness and the lightness\nof the big pneumatic wheels in proportion to the vehicular body, struck\nGraham most vividly. One lank and very high carriage with longitudinal\nmetallic rods hung with the dripping carcasses of many hundred sheep\narrested his attention unduly. Abruptly the edge of the archway cut and\nblotted out the picture.\n\nPresently they left the way and descended by a lift and traversed a\npassage that sloped downward, and so came to a descending lift again.\nThe appearance of things changed. Even the pretence of architectural\nornament disappeared, the lights diminished in number and size, the\narchitecture became more and more massive in proportion to the spaces as\nthe factory quarters were reached. And in the dusty biscuit-making place\nof the potters, among the felspar mills in the furnace rooms of the\nmetal workers, among the incandescent lakes of crude Eadhamite, the blue\ncanvas clothing was on man, woman and child.\n\nMany of these great and dusty galleries were silent avenues of\nmachinery, endless raked out ashen furnaces testified to the\nrevolutionary dislocation, but wherever there was work it was being\ndone by slow-moving workers in blue canvas. The only people not in\nblue canvas were the overlookers of the work-places and the orange-clad\nLabour Police. And fresh from the flushed faces of the dancing halls,\nthe voluntary vigours of the business quarter, Graham could note\nthe pinched faces, the feeble muscles, and weary eyes of many of the\nlatter-day workers. Such as he saw at work were noticeably inferior\nin physique to the few gaily dressed managers and forewomen who were\ndirecting their labours. The burly labourers of the Victorian times\nhad followed the dray horse and all such living force producers, to\nextinction; the place of his costly muscles was taken by some\ndexterous machine. The latter-day labourer, male as well as female, was\nessentially a machine-minder and feeder, a servant and attendant, or an\nartist under direction.\n\nThe women, in comparison with those Graham remembered, were as a class\ndistinctly plain and flat-chested. Two hundred years of emancipation\nfrom the moral restraints of Puritanical religion, two hundred years\nof city life, had done their work in eliminating the strain of feminine\nbeauty and vigour from the blue canvas myriads. To be brilliant\nphysically or mentally, to be in any way attractive or exceptional, had\nbeen and was still a certain way of emancipation to the drudge, a line\nof escape to the Pleasure City and its splendours and delights, and\nat last to the Euthanasy and peace. To be steadfast against such\ninducements was scarcely to be expected of meanly nourished souls. In\nthe young cities of Graham's former life, the newly aggregated labouring\nmass had been a diverse multitude, still stirred by the tradition of\npersonal honour and a high morality; now it was differentiating into a\ndistinct class, with a moral and physical difference of its own--even\nwith a dialect of its own.\n\nThey penetrated downward, ever downward, towards the working places.\nPresently they passed underneath one of the streets of the moving ways,\nand saw its platforms running on their rails far overhead, and chinks of\nwhite lights between the transverse slits. The factories that were not\nworking were sparsely lighted; to Graham they and their shrouded aisles\nof giant machines seemed plunged in gloom, and even where work was going\non the illumination was far less brilliant than upon the public ways.\n\nBeyond the blazing lakes of Eadhamite he came to the warren of the\njewellers, and, with some difficulty and by using his signature,\nobtained admission to these galleries. They were high and dark, and\nrather cold. In the first a few men were making ornaments of gold\nfiligree, each man at a little bench by himself, and with a little\nshaded light. The long vista of light patches, with the nimble fingers\nbrightly lit and moving among the gleaming yellow coils, and the intent\nface like the face of a ghost, in each shadow had the oddest effect.\n\nThe work was beautifully executed, but without any strength of modelling\nor drawing, for the most part intricate grotesques or the ringing of\nthe changes on a geometrical motif. These workers wore a peculiar white\nuniform without pockets or sleeves. They assumed this on coming to\nwork, but at night they were stripped and examined before they left\nthe premises of the Company. In spite of every precaution, the\nLabour policeman told them in a depressed tone, the Company was not\ninfrequently robbed.\n\nBeyond was a gallery of women busied in cutting and setting slabs of\nartificial ruby, and next these were men and women busied together upon\nthe slabs of copper net that formed the basis of cloisonne tiles. Many\nof these workers had lips and nostrils a livid white, due to a disease\ncaused by a peculiar purple enamel that chanced to be much in fashion.\nAsano apologised to Graham for the offence of their faces, but excused\nhimself on the score of the convenience of this route. \"This is what I\nwanted to see,\" said Graham; \"this is what I wanted to see,\" trying to\navoid a start at a particularly striking disfigurement that suddenly\nstared him in the face.\n\n\"She might have done better with herself than that,\" said Asano.\n\nGraham made some indignant comments.\n\n\"But, Sire, we simply could not stand that stuff without the purple,\"\nsaid Asano. \"In your days people could stand such crudities, they were\nnearer the barbaric by two hundred years.\"\n\nThey continued along one of the lower galleries of this cloisonne\nfactory, and came to a little bridge that spanned a vault. Looking\nover the parapet, Graham saw that beneath was a wharf under yet more\ntremendous archings than any he had seen. Three barges, smothered in\nfloury dust, were being unloaded of their cargoes of powdered felspar\nby a multitude of coughing men, each guiding a little truck; the dust\nfilled the place with a choking mist, and turned the electric glare\nyellow. The vague shadows of these workers gesticulated about their\nfeet, and rushed to and fro against a long stretch of white-washed wall.\nEvery now and then one would stop to cough.\n\nA shadowy, huge mass of masonry rising out of the inky water, brought\nto Graham's mind the thought of the multitude of ways and galleries and\nlifts, that rose floor above floor overhead between him and the sky. The\nmen worked in silence under the supervision of two of the Labour Police;\ntheir feet made a hollow thunder on the planks along which they went\nto and fro. And as he looked at this scene, some hidden voice in the\ndarkness began to sing.\n\n\"Stop that!\" shouted one of the policemen, but the order was disobeyed,\nand first one and then all the white-stained men who were working there\nhad taken up the beating refrain, singing it defiantly, the Song of\nthe Revolt. The feet upon the planks thundered now to the rhythm of the\nsong, tramp, tramp, tramp. The policeman who had shouted glanced at\nhis fellow, and Graham saw him shrug his shoulders. He made no further\neffort to stop the singing.\n\nAnd so they went through these factories and places of toil, seeing many\npainful and grim things. But why should the gentle reader be depressed?\nSurely to a refined nature our present world is distressing enough\nwithout bothering ourselves about these miseries to come. We shall not\nsuffer anyhow. Our children may, but what is that to us? That walk left\non Graham's mind a maze of memories, fluctuating pictures of swathed\nhalls, and crowded vaults seen through clouds of dust, of intricate\nmachines, the racing threads of looms, the heavy beat of stamping\nmachinery, the roar and rattle of belt and armature, of ill-lit\nsubterranean aisles of sleeping places, illimitable vistas of pin-point\nlights. And here the smell of tanning, and here the reek of a brewery\nand here, unprecedented reeks. And everywhere were pillars and cross\narchings of such a massiveness as Graham had never before seen, thick\nTitans of greasy, shining brickwork crushed beneath the vast weight of\nthat complex city world, even as these anemic millions were crushed\nby its complexity. And everywhere were pale features, lean limbs,\ndisfigurement and degradation.\n\nOnce and again, and again a third time, Graham heard the song of the\nrevolt during his long, unpleasant research in these places, and once\nhe saw a confused struggle down a passage, and learnt that a number of\nthese serfs had seized their bread before their work was done. Graham\nwas ascending towards the ways again when he saw a number of blue-clad\nchildren running down a transverse passage, and presently perceived\nthe reason of their panic in a company of the Labour Police armed with\nclubs, trotting towards some unknown disturbance. And then came a remote\ndisorder. But for the most part this remnant that worked, worked\nhopelessly. All the spirit that was left in fallen humanity was above in\nthe streets that night, calling for the Master, and valiantly and\nnoisily keeping its arms.\n\nThey emerged from these wanderings and stood blinking in the bright\nlight of the middle passage of the platforms again. They became aware\nof the remote hooting and yelping of the machines of one of the General\nIntelligence Offices, and suddenly came men running, and along the\nplatforms and about the ways everywhere was a shouting and crying. Then\na woman with a face of mute white terror, and another who gasped and\nshrieked as she ran.\n\n\"What has happened now?\" said Graham, puzzled, for he could not\nunderstand their thick speech. Then he heard it in English and perceived\nthat the thing that everyone was shouting, that men yelled to one\nanother, that women took up screaming, that was passing like the first\nbreeze of a thunderstorm, chill and sudden through the city, was this:\n\"Ostrog has ordered the Black Police to London. The Black Police are\ncoming from South Africa.... The Black Police. The Black Police.\"\n\nAsano's face was white and astonished; he hesitated, looked at Graham's\nface, and told him the thing he already knew. \"But how can they know?\"\nasked Asano.\n\nGraham heard someone shouting. \"Stop all work. Stop all work,\" and a\nswarthy hunchback, ridiculously gay in green and gold, came leaping down\nthe platforms toward him, bawling again and again in good English, \"This\nis Ostrog's doing, Ostrog, the Knave! The Master is betrayed.\" His voice\nwas hoarse and a thin foam dropped from his ugly shouting mouth. He\nyelled an unspeakable horror that the Black Police had done in Paris,\nand so passed shrieking, \"Ostrog the Knave!\"\n\nFor a moment Graham stood still, for it had come upon him again that\nthese things were a dream. He looked up at the great cliff of buildings\non either side, vanishing into blue haze at last above the lights, and\ndown to the roaring tiers of platforms, and the shouting, running people\nwho were gesticulating past. \"The Master is betrayed!\" they cried. \"The\nMaster is betrayed!\"\n\nSuddenly the situation shaped itself in his mind real and urgent. His\nheart began to beat fast and strong.\n\n\"It has come,\" he said. \"I might have known. The hour has come.\"\n\nHe thought swiftly. \"What am I to do?\"\n\n\"Go back to the Council House,\" said Asano.\n\n\"Why should I not appeal--? The people are here.\"\n\n\"You will lose time. They will doubt if it is you. But they will mass\nabout the Council House. There you will find their leaders. Your\nstrength is there with them.\"\n\n\"Suppose this is only a rumour?\"\n\n\"It sounds true,\" said Asano.\n\n\"Let us have the facts,\" said Graham.\n\nAsano shrugged his shoulders. \"We had better get towards the Council\nHouse,\" he cried. \"That is where they will swarm. Even now the ruins may\nbe impassable.\"\n\nGraham regarded him doubtfully and followed him.\n\nThey went up the stepped platforms to the swiftest one, and there Asano\naccosted a labourer. The answers to his questions were in the thick,\nvulgar speech.\n\n\"What did he say?\" asked Graham.\n\n\"He knows little, but he told me that the Black Police would have\narrived here before the people knew--had not someone in the Wind-Vane\nOffices Learnt. He said a girl.\"\n\n\"A girl? Not?\"\n\n\"He said a girl--he did not know who she was. Who came out from the\nCouncil House crying aloud, and told the men at work among the ruins.\"\n\nAnd then another thing was shouted, something that turned an aimless\ntumult into determinate movements, it came like a wind along the street.\n\"To your Wards, to your Wards. Every man get arms. Every man to his\nWard!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII. THE STRUGGLE IN THE COUNCIL HOUSE\n\nAs Asano and Graham hurried along to the ruins about the Council House,\nthey saw everywhere the excitement of the people rising. \"To your Wards\nTo your Wards!\" Everywhere men and women in blue were hurrying from\nunknown subterranean employments, up the staircases of the middle\npath--at one place Graham saw an arsenal of the revolutionary committee\nbesieged by a crowd of shouting men, at another a couple of men in the\nhated yellow uniform of the Labour Police, pursued by a gathering\ncrowd, fled precipitately along the swift way that went in the opposite\ndirection.\n\nThe cries of \"To your Wards!\" became at last a continuous shouting\nas they drew near the Government quarter. Many of the shouts were\nunintelligible. \"Ostrog has betrayed us,\" one man bawled in a hoarse\nvoice, again and again, dinning that refrain into Graham's ear until\nit haunted him. This person stayed close beside Graham and Asano on the\nswift way, shouting to the people who swarmed on the lower platforms as\nhe rushed past them. His cry about Ostrog alternated with some\nincomprehensible orders Presently he went leaping down and disappeared.\n\nGraham's mind was filled with the din. His plans were vague and\nunformed. He had one picture of some commanding position from which he\ncould address the multitudes, another of meeting Ostrog face to face. He\nwas full of rage, of tense muscular excitement, his hands gripped, his\nlips were pressed together.\n\nThe way to the Council House across the ruins was impassable, but Asano\nmet that difficulty and took Graham into the premises of the central\npost-office. The post-office was nominally at work, but the blue-clothed\nporters moved sluggishly or had stopped to stare through the arches of\ntheir galleries at the shouting men who were going by outside. \"Every\nman to his Ward! Every man to his Ward!\" Here, by Asano's advice, Graham\nrevealed his identity.\n\nThey crossed to the Council House by a cable cradle. Already in the\nbrief interval since the capitulation of the Councillors a great change\nhad been wrought in the appearance of the ruins. The spurting cascades\nof the ruptured sea water-mains had been captured and tamed, and huge\ntemporary pipes ran overhead along a flimsy looking fabric of girders.\nThe sky was laced with restored cables and wires that served the Council\nHouse, and a mass of new fabric with cranes and other building machines\ngoing to and fro upon it, projected to the left of the white pile.\n\nThe moving ways that ran across this area had been restored, albeit for\nonce running under the open sky. These were the ways that Graham had\nseen from the little balcony in the hour of his awakening, not nine days\nsince, and the hall of his Trance had been on the further side, where\nnow shapeless piles of smashed and shattered masonry were heaped\ntogether.\n\nIt was already high day and the sun was shining brightly. Out of their\ntall caverns of blue electric light came the swift ways crowded with\nmultitudes of people, who poured off them and gathered ever denser\nover the wreckage and confusion of the ruins. The air was full of\ntheir shouting, and they were pressing and swaying towards the central\nbuilding. For the most part that shouting mass consisted of shapeless\nswarms, but here and there Graham could see that a rude discipline\nstruggled to establish itself. And every voice clamoured for order in\nthe chaos. \"To your Wards! Every man to his Ward!\"\n\nThe cable carried them into a hall which Graham recognised as the\nante-chamber to the Hall of the Atlas, about the gallery of which he had\nwalked days ago with Howard to show himself to the vanished Council, an\nhour from his awakening. Now the place was empty except for two cable\nattendants. These men seemed hugely astonished to recognise the Sleeper\nin the man who swung down from the cross seat.\n\n\"Where is Helen Wotton?\" he demanded. \"Where is Helen Wotton?\"\n\nThey did not know.\n\n\"Then where is Ostrog? I must see Ostrog forthwith. He has disobeyed me.\nI have come back to take things out of his hands.\" Without waiting for\nAsano, he went straight across the place, ascended the steps at the\nfurther end, and, pulling the curtain aside, found himself facing the\nperpetually labouring Titan.\n\nThe hall was empty. Its appearance had changed very greatly since\nhis first sight of it. It had suffered serious injury in the violent\nstruggle of the first outbreak. On the right hand side of the great\nfigure the upper half of the wall had been torn away for nearly two\nhundred feet of its length, and a sheet of the same glassy film that\nhad enclosed Graham at his awakening had been drawn across the gap. This\ndeadened, but did not altogether exclude the roar of the people outside.\n\"Wards! Wards! Wards!\" they seemed to be saying. Through it there were\nvisible the beams and supports of metal scaffoldings that rose and\nfell according to the requirements of a great crowd of workmen. An idle\nbuilding machine, with lank arms of red painted metal that caught\nthe still plastic blocks of mineral paste and swung them neatly into\nposition, stretched gauntly across this green tinted picture. On it were\nstill a number of workmen staring at the crowd below. For a moment he\nstood regarding these things, and Asano overtook him.\n\n\"Ostrog,\" said Asano, \"will be in the small offices beyond there.\" The\nlittle man looked livid now and his eyes searched Graham's face.\n\nThey had scarcely advanced ten paces from the curtain before a little\npanel to the left of the Atlas rolled up, and Ostrog, accompanied by\nLincoln and followed by two black and yellow clad negroes, appeared\ncrossing the remote corner of the hall, towards a second panel that was\nraised and open. \"Ostrog,\" shouted Graham, and at the sound of his voice\nthe little party turned astonished.\n\nOstrog said something to Lincoln and advanced alone.\n\nGraham was the first to speak. His voice was loud and dictatorial. \"What\nis this I hear?\" he asked. \"Are you bringing negroes here--to keep the\npeople down?\"\n\n\"It is none too soon,\" said Ostrog. \"They have been getting out of hand\nmore and more, since the revolt. I under-estimated--\"\n\n\"Do you mean that these infernal negroes are on the way?\"\n\n\"On the way. As it is, you have seen the people--outside?\"\n\n\"No wonder! But--after what was said. You have taken too much on\nyourself, Ostrog.\"\n\nOstrog said nothing, but drew nearer.\n\n\"These negroes must not come to London,\" said Graham. \"I am Master and\nthey shall not come.\"\n\nOstrog glanced at Lincoln, who at once came towards them with his two\nattendants close behind him. \"Why not?\" asked Ostrog.\n\n\"White men must be mastered by white men. Besides--\"\n\n\"The negroes are only an instrument.\"\n\n\"But that is not the question. I am the Master. I mean to be the Master.\nAnd I tell you these negroes shall not come.\"\n\n\"The people--\"\n\n\"I believe in the people.\"\n\n\"Because you are an anachronism. You are a man out of the Past--an\naccident. You are Owner perhaps of half the property in the world. But\nyou are not Master. You do not know enough to be Master.\"\n\nHe glanced at Lincoln again. \"I know now what you think--I can guess\nsomething of what you mean to do. Even now it is not too late to warn\nyou. You dream of human equality--of a socialistic order--you have all\nthose worn-out dreams of the nineteenth century fresh and vivid in your\nmind, and you would rule this age that you do not understand.\"\n\n\"Listen!\" said Graham. \"You can hear it--a sound like the sea. Not\nvoices--but a voice. Do you altogether understand?\"\n\n\"We taught them that,\" said Ostrog.\n\n\"Perhaps. Can you teach them to forget it? But enough of this! These\nnegroes must not come.\"\n\nThere was a pause and Ostrog looked him in the eyes.\n\n\"They will,\" he said.\n\n\"I forbid it,\" said Graham.\n\n\"They have started.\"\n\n\"I will not have it.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Ostrog. \"Sorry as I am to follow the method of the Council--.\nFor your own good--you must not side with disorder. And now that you are\nhere--. It was kind of you to come here.\"\n\nLincoln laid his hand on Graham's shoulder. Abruptly Graham realized\nthe enormity of his blunder in coming to the Council House. He turned\ntowards the curtains that separated the hall from the antechamber.\nThe clutching hand of Asano intervened. In another moment Lincoln had\ngrasped Graham's cloak.\n\nHe turned and struck at Lincoln's face, and incontinently a negro\nhad him by collar and arm. He wrenched himself away, his sleeve tore\nnoisily, and he stumbled back, to be tripped by the other attendant.\nThen he struck the ground heavily and he was staring at the distant\nceiling of the hall.\n\nHe shouted, rolled over, struggling fiercely, clutched an attendant's\nleg and threw him headlong, and struggled to his feet.\n\nLincoln appeared before him, went down heavily again with a blow under\nthe point of the jaw and lay still. Graham made two strides, stumbled.\nAnd then Ostrog's arm was round his neck, he was pulled over backward,\nfell heavily, and his arms were pinned to the ground. After a few\nviolent efforts he ceased to struggle and lay staring at Ostrog's\nheaving throat.\n\n\"You--are--a prisoner,\" panted Ostrog, exulting. \"You--were rather a\nfool--to come back.\"\n\nGraham turned his head about and perceived through the irregular\ngreen window in the walls of the hall the men who had been working the\nbuilding cranes gesticulating excitedly to the people below them. They\nhad seen!\n\nOstrog followed his eyes and started. He shouted something to Lincoln,\nbut Lincoln did not move. A bullet smashed among the mouldings above\nthe Atlas The two sheets of transparent matter that had been stretched\nacross this gap were rent, the edges of the torn aperture darkened,\ncurved, ran rapidly towards the framework, and in a moment the Council\nchamber stood open to the air. A chilly gust blew in by the gap,\nbringing with it a war of voices from the ruinous spaces without,\nan elvish babblement, \"Save the Master!\" \"What are they doing to the\nMaster?\" \"The Master is betrayed!\"\n\nAnd then he realised that Ostrog's attention was distracted, that\nOstrog's grip had relaxed, and, wrenching his arms free, he struggled\nto his knees. In another moment he had thrust Ostrog back, and he was\non one foot, his hand gripping Ostrog's throat, and Ostrog's hands\nclutching the silk about his neck. But now men were coming towards them\nfrom the dais--men whose intentions he misunderstood. He had a\nglimpse of someone running in the distance towards the curtains of the\nantechamber, and then Ostrog had slipped from him and these newcomers\nwere upon him. To his infinite astonishment, they seized him. They\nobeyed the shouts of Ostrog.\n\nHe was lugged a dozen yards before he realised that they were not\nfriends--that they were dragging him towards the open panel. When he saw\nthis he pulled back, he tried to fling himself down, he shouted for help\nwith all his strength. And this time there were answering cries.\n\nThe grip upon his neck relaxed, and behold! in the lower corner of the\nrent upon the wall, first one and then a number of little black figures\nappeared shouting and waving arms. They came leaping down from the gap\ninto the light gallery that had led to the Silent Rooms. They ran along\nit, so near were they that Graham could see the weapons in their hands,\nThen Ostrog was shouting in his ear to the men who held him, and once\nmore he was struggling with all his strength against their endeavours to\nthrust him towards the opening that yawned to receive him. \"They can't\ncome down,\" panted Ostrog. \"They daren't fire. It's all right.\" \"We'll\nsave him from them yet.\"\n\nFor long minutes as it seemed to Graham that inglorious struggle\ncontinued. His clothes were rent in a dozen places, he was covered in\ndust, one hand had been trodden upon. He could hear the shouts of his\nsupporters, and once he heard shots. He could feel his strength giving\nway, feel his efforts wild and aimless. But no help came, and surely,\nirresistibly, that black, yawning opening came nearer.\n\nThe pressure upon him relaxed and he struggled up. He saw Ostrog's grey\nhead receding and perceived that he was no longer held. He turned about\nand came full into a man in black. One of the green weapons cracked\nclose to him, a drift of pungent smoke came into his face, and a steel\nblade flashed. The huge chamber span about him.\n\nHe saw a man in pale blue stabbing one of the black and yellow\nattendants not three yards from his face. Then hands were upon him\nagain.\n\nHe was being pulled in two, directions now. It seemed as though people\nwere shouting to him. He wanted to understand and could not. Someone\nwas clutching about his thighs, he was being hoisted in spite of his\nvigorous efforts. He understood suddenly, he ceased to struggle. He was\nlifted up on men's shoulders and carried away from that devouring panel.\nTen thousand throats were cheering.\n\nHe saw men in blue and black hurrying after the retreating Ostrogites\nand firing. Lifted up, he saw now across the whole expanse of the hall\nbeneath the Atlas image, saw that he was being carried towards the\nraised platform in the centre of the place. The far end of the hall was\nalready full of people running towards him. They were looking at him and\ncheering.\n\nHe became aware that a sort of body-guard surrounded him. Active\nmen about him shouted vague orders. He saw close at hand the black\nmoustached man in yellow who had been among those who had greeted him\nin the public theatre, shouting directions. The hall was already densely\npacked with swaying people, the little metal gallery sagged with a\nshouting load, the curtains at the end had been torn away, and the\nante-chamber was revealed densely crowded. He could scarcely make the\nman near him hear for the tumult about them. \"Where has Ostrog gone?\" he\nasked.\n\nThe man he questioned pointed over the heads towards the lower panels\nabout the hall on the side opposite the gap. They stood open and\narmed men, blue clad with black sashes, were running through them and\nvanishing into the chambers and passages beyond. It seemed to Graham\nthat a sound of firing drifted through the riot. He was carried in a\nstaggering curve across the great hall towards an opening beneath the\ngap.\n\nHe perceived men working with a sort of rude discipline to keep the\ncrowd off him, to make a space clear about him. He passed out of the\nhall, and saw a crude, new wall rising blankly before him topped by blue\nsky. He was swung down to his feet; someone gripped his arm and guided\nhim. He found the man in yellow close at hand. They were taking him up\na narrow stairway of brick, and close at hand rose the great red painted\nmasses, the cranes and levers and the still engines of the big building\nmachine.\n\nHe was at the top of the steps. He was hurried across a narrow railed\nfootway, and suddenly with a vast shouting the amphitheatre of ruins\nopened again before him. \"The Master is with us! The Master! The\nMaster!\" The shout swept athwart the lake of faces like a wave, broke\nagainst the distant cliff of ruins, and came back in a welter of cries.\n\"The Master is on our side!\"\n\nGraham perceived that he was no longer encompassed by people, that he\nwas standing upon a little temporary platform of white metal, part of\na flimsy seeming scaffolding that laced about the great mass of the\nCouncil House. Over all the huge expanse of the ruins, swayed and\neddied the shouting people; and here and there the black banners of\nthe revolutionary societies ducked and swayed and formed rare nuclei of\norganisation in the chaos. Up the steep stairs of wall and scaffolding\nby which his rescuers had reached the opening in the Atlas Chamber,\nclung a solid crowd, and little energetic black figures clinging to\npillars and projections were strenuous to induce these congested masses\nto stir. Behind him, at a higher point on the scaffolding, a number of\nmen struggled upwards with the flapping folds of a huge black standard.\nThrough the yawning gap in the walls below him he could look down upon\nthe packed attentive multitudes in the Hall of the Atlas. The distant\nflying stages to the south came out bright and vivid, brought nearer\nas it seemed by an unusual translucency of the air. A solitary aeropile\nbeat up from the central stage as if to meet the coming aeroplanes.\n\n\"What had become of Ostrog?\" asked Graham, and even as he spoke he saw\nthat all eyes were turned from him towards the crest of the Council\nHouse building. He looked also in this direction of universal attention.\nFor a moment he saw nothing but the jagged corner of a wall, hard and\nclear against the sky. Then in the shadow he perceived the interior of a\nroom and recognised with a start the green and white decorations of his\nformer prison. And coming quickly across this opened room and up to the\nvery verge of the cliff of the ruins came a little white clad figure\nfollowed by two other smaller seeming figures in black and yellow. He\nheard the man beside him exclaim \"Ostrog,\" and turned to ask a question.\nBut he never did, because of the startled exclamation of another of\nthose who were with him and a lank finger suddenly pointing. He looked,\nand behold the aeropile that had been rising from the flying stage when\nlast he had looked in that direction, was driving towards them. The\nswift steady flight was still novel enough to hold his attention.\n\nNearer it came, growing rapidly larger and larger, until it had swept\nover the further edge of the ruins and into view of the dense multitudes\nbelow. It drooped across the space and rose and passed overhead, rising\nto clear the mass of the Council House, a filmy translucent shape with\nthe solitary aeronaut peering down through its ribs. It vanished beyond\nthe skyline of the ruins.\n\nGraham transferred his attention to Ostrog. He was signalling with his\nhands, and his attendants busy breaking down the wall beside him. In\nanother moment the aeropile came into view again, a little thing far\naway, coming round in a wide curve and going slower.\n\nThen suddenly the man in yellow shouted: \"What are they doing? What are\nthe people doing? Why is Ostrog left there? Why is he not captured? They\nwill lift him--the aeropile will lift him! Ah!\"\n\nThe exclamation was echoed by a shout from the ruins. The rattling sound\nof the green weapons drifted across the intervening gulf to Graham, and,\nlooking down, he saw a number of black and yellow uniforms running along\none of the galleries that lay open to the air below the promontory\nupon which Ostrog stood. They fired as they ran at men unseen, and then\nemerged a number of pale blue figures in pursuit. These minute fighting\nfigures had the oddest effect; they seemed as they ran like little model\nsoldiers in a toy. This queer appearance of a house cut open gave that\nstruggle amidst furniture and passages a quality of unreality. It was\nperhaps two hundred yards away from him, and very nearly fifty above\nthe heads in the ruins below. The black and yellow men ran into an\nopen archway, and turned and fired a volley. One of the blue pursuers\nstriding forward close to the edge, flung up his arms, staggered\nsideways, seemed to Graham's sense to hang over the edge for several\nseconds, and fell headlong down. Graham saw him strike a projecting\ncorner, fly out, head over heels, head over heels, and vanish behind the\nred arm of the building machine.\n\nAnd then a shadow came between Graham and the sun. He looked up and the\nsky was clear, but he knew the aeropile had passed. Ostrog had vanished.\nThe man in yellow thrust before him, zealous and perspiring, pointing\nand blatent.\n\n\"They are grounding!\" cried the man in yellow. \"They are grounding. Tell\nthe people to fire at him. Tell them to fire at him!\"\n\nGraham could not understand. He heard loud voices repeating these\nenigmatical orders.\n\nSuddenly over the edge of the ruins he saw the prow of the aeropile come\ngliding and stop with a jerk. In a moment Graham understood that the\nthing had grounded in order that Ostrog might escape by it. He saw a\nblue haze climbing out of the gulf, perceived that the people below him\nwere now firing up at the projecting stem.\n\nA man beside him cheered hoarsely, and he saw that the blue rebels\nhad gained the archway that had been contested by the men in black and\nyellow a moment before, and were running in a continual stream along the\nopen passage.\n\nAnd suddenly the aeropile slipped over the edge of the Council House\nand fell. It dropped, tilting at an angle of forty-five degrees, and\ndropping so steeply that it seemed to Graham, it seemed perhaps to most\nof these below, that it could not possibly rise again.\n\nIt fell so closely past him that he could see Ostrog clutching the\nguides of the seat, with his grey hair streaming; see the white-faced\naeronaut wrenching over the lever that drove the engine along its\nguides. He heard the apprehensive vague cry of innumerable men below.\n\nGraham clutched the railing before him and gasped. The second seemed an\nage. The lower fan of the aeropile passed within an ace of touching the\npeople, who yelled and screamed and trampled one another below.\n\nAnd then it rose.\n\nFor a moment it looked as if it could not possibly clear the opposite\ncliff, and then that it could not possibly clear the wind-wheel that\nrotated beyond.\n\nAnd behold! it was clear and soaring, still heeling sideways, upward,\nupward into the wind-swept sky.\n\nThe suspense of the moment gave place to a fury of exasperation as the\nswarming people realised that Ostrog had escaped them. With belated\nactivity they renewed their fire, until the rattling wove into a roar,\nuntil the whole area became dim and blue and the air pungent with the\nthin smoke of their weapons.\n\nToo late! The aeropile dwindled smaller and smaller, and curved about\nand swept gracefully downward to the flying stage from which it had so\nlately risen. Ostrog had escaped.\n\nFor a while a confused babblement arose from the ruins, and then\nthe universal attention came back to Graham, perched high among the\nscaffolding. He saw the faces of the people turned towards him, heard\ntheir shouts at his rescue. From the throat of the ways came the song of\nthe revolt spreading like a breeze across that swaying sea of men.\n\nThe little group of men about him shouted congratulations on his escape.\nThe man in yellow was close to him, with a set face and shining eyes.\nAnd the song was rising, louder and louder; tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp.\n\nSlowly the realisation came of the full meaning of these things to him,\nthe perception of the swift change in his position. Ostrog, who had\nstood beside him whenever he had faced that shouting multitude before,\nwas beyond there--the antagonist. There was no one to rule for him any\nlonger. Even the people about him, the leaders and organisers of the\nmultitude, looked to see what he would do, looked to him to act, awaited\nhis orders. He was King indeed. His puppet reign was at an end.\n\nHe was very intent to do the thing that was expected of him. His nerves\nand muscles were quivering, his mind was perhaps a little confused,\nbut he felt neither fear nor anger. His hand that had been trodden upon\nthrobbed and was hot. He was a little nervous about his bearing. He knew\nhe was not afraid, but he was anxious not to seem afraid. In his former\nlife he had often been more excited in playing games of skill. He was\ndesirous of immediate action, he knew he must not think too much in\ndetail of the huge complexity of the struggle about him lest he should\nbe paralysed by the sense of its intricacy. Over there those square blue\nshapes, the flying stages, meant Ostrog; against Ostrog he was fighting\nfor the world.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII. WHILE THE AEROPLANES WERE COMING\n\nFor a time the Master of the Earth was not even master of his own mind.\nEven his will seemed a will not his own, his own acts surprised him\nand were but a part of the confusion of strange experiences that poured\nacross his being. These things were definite, the aeroplanes were\ncoming, Helen Wotton had warned the people of their coming, and he was\nMaster of the Earth. Each of these facts seemed struggling for complete\npossession of his thoughts. They protruded from a background of swarming\nhalls, elevated passages, rooms jammed with ward leaders in council\nkinematograph and telephone rooms, and windows looking out on a seething\nsea of marching men. The man in yellow, and men whom he fancied were\ncalled Ward Leaders, were either propelling him forward or following\nhim obediently; it was hard to tell. Perhaps they were doing a little of\nboth. Perhaps some power unseen and unsuspected, propelled them all. He\nwas aware that he was going to make a proclamation to the People of the\nEarth, aware of certain grandiose phrases floating in his mind as the\nthing he meant to say. Many little things happened, and then he found\nhimself with the man in yellow entering a little room where this\nproclamation of his was to be made.\n\nThis room was grotesquely latter-day in its appointments. In the centre\nwas a bright oval lit by shaded electric lights from above. The rest\nwas in shadow, and the double finely fitting doors through which he came\nfrom the swarming Hall of the Atlas made the place very still. The dead\nthud of these as they closed behind him, the sudden cessation of the\ntumult in which he had been living for hours, the quivering circle of\nlight, the whispers and quick noiseless movements of vaguely visible\nattendants in the shadows, had a strange effect upon Graham. The huge\nears of a phonographic mechanism gaped in a battery for his words, the\nblack eyes of great photographic cameras awaited his beginning, beyond\nmetal rods and coils glittered dimly, and something whirled about with a\ndroning hum. He walked into the centre of the light, and his shadow drew\ntogether black and sharp to a little blot at his feet.\n\nThe vague shape of the thing he meant to say was already in his mind.\nBut this silence, this isolation, the sudden withdrawal from that\ncontagious crowd, this silent audience of gaping, glaring machines\nhad not been in his anticipation. All his supports seemed withdrawn\ntogether; he seemed to have dropped into this suddenly, suddenly to have\ndiscovered himself. In a moment he was changed. He found that he now\nfeared to be inadequate, he feared to be theatrical, he feared the\nquality of his voice, the quality of his wit, astonished, he turned to\nthe man in yellow with a propitiatory gesture. \"For a moment,\" he said,\n\"I must wait. I did not think it would be like this. I must think of the\nthing I have to say.\"\n\nWhile he was still hesitating there came an agitated messenger with news\nthat the foremost aeroplanes were passing over Arawan.\n\n\"Arawan?\" he said. \"Where is that? But anyhow, they are coming. They\nwill be here. When?\"\n\n\"By twilight.\"\n\n\"Great God! In only a few hours. What news of the flying stages?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"The people of the south-west wards are ready.\"\n\n\"Ready!\"\n\nHe turned impatiently to the blank circles of the lenses again.\n\n\"I suppose it must be a sort of speech. Would to God I knew certainly\nthe thing that should be said! Aeroplanes at Arawan! They must have\nstarted before the main fleet. And the people only ready! Surely...\"\n\n\"Oh! what does it matter whether I speak well or ill?\" he said, and felt\nthe light grow brighter.\n\nHe had framed some vague sentence of democratic sentiment when suddenly\ndoubts overwhelmed him. His belief in his heroic quality and calling\nhe found had altogether lost its assured conviction. The picture of a\nlittle strutting futility in a windy waste of incomprehensible destinies\nreplaced it. Abruptly it was perfectly clear to him that this revolt\nagainst Ostrog was premature, foredoomed to failure, the impulse of\npassionate inadequacy against inevitable things. He thought of that\nswift flight of aeroplanes like the swoop of Fate towards him. He was\nastonished that he could have seen things in any other light. In that\nfinal emergency he debated, thrust debate resolutely aside, determined\nat all costs to go through with the thing he had undertaken. And he\ncould find no word to begin. Even as he stood, awkward, hesitating, with\nan indiscrete apology for his inability trembling on his lips, came the\nnoise of many people crying out, the running to and fro of feet. \"Wait,\"\ncried someone, and a door opened. \"She is coming,\" said the voices.\nGraham turned, and the watching lights waned.\n\nThrough the open doorway he saw a slight grey figure advancing across\na spacious hall. His heart leapt. It was Helen Wotton. Behind and about\nher marched a riot of applause. The man in yellow came out of the nearer\nshadows into the circle of light.\n\n\"This is the girl who told us what Ostrog had dune,\" he said.\n\nHer face was aflame, and the heavy coils of her black hair fell about\nher shoulders. The folds of the soft silk robe she wore streamed from\nher and floated in the rhythm of her advance. She drew nearer and\nnearer, and his heart was beating fast. All his doubts were gone. The\nshadow of the doorway fell athwart her face and she was near him. \"You\nhave not betrayed us?\" she cried. \"You are with us?\"\n\n\"Where have you been?\" said Graham.\n\n\"At the office of the south-west wards. Until ten minutes since I did\nnot know you had returned. I went to the office of the south-west wards\nto find the Ward Leaders in order that they might tell the people.\"\n\n\"I came back so soon as I heard--.\"\n\n\"I knew,\" she cried, \"knew you would be with us. And it was I--it was\nI that told them. They have risen. All the world is rising. The people\nhave awakened. Thank God that I did not act in vain! You are Master\nstill.\"\n\n\"You told them\" he said slowly, and he saw that in spite of her steady\neyes her lips trembled and her throat rose and fell.\n\n\"I told them. I knew of the order. I was here. I heard that the negroes\nwere to come to London to guard you and to keep the people down--to keep\nyou a prisoner. And I stopped it. I came out and told the people. And\nyou are Master still.\"\n\nGraham glanced at the black lenses of the cameras, the vast listening\nears, and back to her face. \"I am Master still,\" he said slowly, and the\nswift rush of a fleet of aeroplanes passed across his thoughts.\n\n\"And you did this? You, who are the niece of Ostrog.\"\n\n\"For you,\" she cried. \"For you! That you for whom the world has waited\nshould not be cheated of your power.\"\n\nGraham stood for a space, wordless, regarding her. His doubts and\nquestionings had fled before her presence. He remembered the things that\nhe had meant to say. He faced the cameras again and the light about him\ngrew brighter. He turned again towards her.\n\n\"You have saved me,\" he said; \"you have saved my power. And the battle\nis beginning. God knows what this night will see--but not dishonour.\"\n\nHe paused. He addressed himself to the unseen multitudes who stared upon\nhim through those grotesque black eyes. At first he spoke slowly. \"Men\nand women of the new age,\" he said; \"You have arisen to do battle for\nthe race... There is no easy victory before us.\"\n\nHe stopped to gather words. The thoughts that had been in his mind\nbefore she came returned, but transfigured, no longer touched with the\nshadow of a possible irrelevance. \"This night is a beginning,\" he cried.\n\"This battle that is coming, this battle that rushes upon us to-night,\nis only a beginning. All your lives, it may be, you must fight. Take no\nthought though I am beaten, though I am utterly overthrown.\"\n\nHe found the thing in his mind too vague for words. He paused\nmomentarily, and broke into vague exhortations, and then a rush of\nspeech came upon him. Much that he said was but the humanitarian\ncommonplace of a vanished age, but the conviction of his voice touched\nit to vitality. He stated the case of the old days to the people of the\nnew age, to the woman at his side. \"I come out of the past to you,\"\nhe said, \"with the memory of an age that hoped. My age was an age of\ndreams--of beginnings, an age of noble hopes; throughout the world\nwe had made an end of slavery; throughout the world we had spread the\ndesire and anticipation that wars might cease, that all men and women\nmight live nobly, in freedom and peace. ... So we hoped in the days that\nare past. And what of those hopes? How is it with man after two hundred\nyears?\n\n\"Great cities, vast powers, a collective greatness beyond our dreams.\nFor that we did not work, and that has come. But how is it with the\nlittle lives that make up this greater life? How is it with the common\nlives? As it has ever been--sorrow and labour, lives cramped and\nunfulfilled, lives tempted by power, tempted by wealth, and gone to\nwaste and folly. The old faiths have faded and changed, the new faith--.\nIs there a new faith?\"\n\nThings that he had long wished to believe, he found that he believed. He\nplunged at belief and seized it, and clung for a time at her level. He\nspoke gustily, in broken incomplete sentences, but with all his heart\nand strength, of this new faith within him. He spoke of the greatness of\nself-abnegation, of his belief in an immortal life of Humanity in which\nwe live and move and have our being. His voice rose and fell, and the\nrecording appliances hummed their hurried applause, dim attendants\nwatched him out of the shadow. Through all those doubtful places his\nsense of that silent spectator beside him sustained his sincerity. For a\nfew glorious moments he was carried away; he felt no doubt of his heroic\nquality, no doubt of his heroic words, he had it all straight and plain.\nHis eloquence limped no longer. And at last he made an end to speaking.\n\"Here and now,\" he cried, \"I make my will. All that is mine in the world\nI give to the people of the world. All that is mine in the world I give\nto the people of the world. I give it to you, and myself I give to you.\nAnd as God wills, I will live for you, or I will die.\"\n\nHe ended with a florid gesture and turned about. He found the light of\nhis present exaltation reflected in the face of the girl. Their eyes\nmet; her eyes were swimming with tears of enthusiasm. They seemed to be\nurged towards each other. They clasped hands and stood gripped, facing\none another, in an eloquent silence. She whispered. \"I knew,\" she\nwhispered. \"I knew.\" He could not speak, he crushed her hand in his. His\nmind was the theatre of gigantic passions.\n\n\nThe man in yellow was beside them. Neither had noted his coming. He was\nsaying that the south-west wards were marching. \"I never expected it so\nsoon,\" he cried. \"They have done wonders. You must send them a word to\nhelp them on their way.\"\n\nGraham dropped Helen's hand and stared at him absent-mindedly. Then\nwith a start he returned to his previous preoccupation about the flying\nstages.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"That is good, that is good.\" He weighed a message.\n\"Tell them;--well done South West.\"\n\nHe turned his eyes to Helen Wotton again. His face expressed his\nstruggle between conflicting ideas. \"We must capture the flying stages,\"\nhe explained. \"Unless we can do that they will land negroes. At all\ncosts we must prevent that.\"\n\nHe felt even as he spoke that this was not what had been in his mind\nbefore the interruption. He saw a touch of surprise in her eyes. She\nseemed about to speak and a shrill bell drowned her voice.\n\nIt occurred to Graham that she expected him to lead these marching\npeople, that that was the thing he had to do. He made the offer\nabruptly. He addressed the man in yellow, but he spoke to her. He saw\nher face respond. \"Here I am doing nothing,\" he said.\n\n\"It is impossible,\" protested the man in yellow.\n\n\"It is a fight in a warren. Your place is here.\"\n\nHe explained elaborately. He motioned towards the room where Graham must\nwait, he insisted no other course was possible. \"We must know where you\nare,\" he said. \"At any moment a crisis may arise needing your presence\nand decision.\" The room was a luxurious little apartment with news\nmachines and a broken mirror that had once been en _rapport_ with the\ncrow's nest specula. It seemed a matter of course to Graham that Helen\nshould stop with him.\n\nA picture had drifted through his mind of such a vast dramatic struggle\nas the masses in the ruins had suggested. But here was no spectacular\nbattle-field such as he imagined. Instead was seclusion--and suspense.\nIt was only as the afternoon wore on that he pieced together a truer\npicture of the fight that was raging, inaudibly and invisibly,\nwithin four miles of him, beneath the Roehampton stage. A strange and\nunprecedented contest it was, a battle that was a hundred thousand\nlittle battles, a battle in a sponge of ways and channels, fought out\nof sight of sky or sun under the electric glare, fought out in a vast\nconfusion by multitudes untrained in arms, led chiefly by acclamation,\nmultitudes dulled by mindless labour and enervated by the tradition of\ntwo hundred years of servile security against multitudes demoralised by\nlives of venial privilege and sensual indulgence. They had no artillery,\nno differentiation into this force or that; the only weapon on either\nside was the little green metal carbine, whose secret manufacture and\nsudden distribution in enormous quantities had been one of Ostrog's\nculminating moves against the Council. Few had had any experience with\nthis weapon, many had never discharged one, many who carried it came\nunprovided with ammunition; never was wilder firing in the history of\nwarfare. It was a battle of amateurs, a hideous experimental warfare,\narmed rioters fighting armed rioters, armed rioters swept forward by\nthe words and fury of a song, by the tramping sympathy of their numbers,\npouring in countless myriads towards the smaller ways, the disabled\nlifts, the galleries slippery with blood, the halls and passages choked\nwith smoke, beneath the flying stages, to learn there when retreat was\nhopeless the ancient mysteries of warfare. And overhead save for a few\nsharpshooters upon the roof spaces and for a few bands and threads of\nvapour that multiplied and darkened towards the evening, the day was a\nclear serenity. Ostrog it seems had no bombs at command and in all\nthe earlier phases of the battle the aeropiles played no part. Not the\nsmallest cloud was there to break the empty brilliance of the sky. It\nseemed as though it held itself vacant until the aeroplanes should come.\n\nEver and again there was news of these, drawing nearer, from this\nMediterranean port and then that, and presently from the south of\nFrance. But of the new guns that Ostrog had made and which were known to\nbe in the city came no news in spite of Graham's urgency, nor any report\nof successes from the dense felt of fighting strands about the flying\nstages. Section after section of the Labour Societies reported itself\nassembled, reported itself marching, and vanished from knowledge into\nthe labyrinth of that warfare What was happening there? Even the busy\nward leaders did not know. In spite of the opening and closing of\ndoors, the hasty messengers, the ringing of bells and the perpetual\nclitter-clack of recording implements, Graham felt isolated, strangely\ninactive, inoperative.\n\nTheir isolation seemed at times the strangest, the most unexpected of\nall the things that had happened since his awakening. It had something\nof the quality of that inactivity that comes in dreams. A tumult, the\nstupendous realisation of a world struggle between Ostrog and himself,\nand then this confined quiet little room with its mouthpieces and bells\nand broken mirror!\n\nNow the door would be closed and they were alone together; they seemed\nsharply marked off then from all the unprecedented world storm that\nrushed together without, vividly aware of one another, only concerned\nwith one another. Then the door would open again, messengers would\nenter, or a sharp bell would stab their quiet privacy, and it was like\na window in a well built brightly lit house flung open suddenly to a\nhurricane. The dark hurry and tumult, the stress and vehemence of the\nbattle rushed in and overwhelmed them. They were no longer persons\nbut mere spectators, mere impressions of a tremendous convulsion.\nThey became unreal even to themselves, miniatures of personality,\nindescribably small, and the two antagonistic realities, the only\nrealities in being were first the city, that throbbed and roared yonder\nin a belated frenzy of defence and secondly the aeroplanes hurling\ninexorably towards them over the round shoulder of the world.\n\nAt first their mood had been one of exalted confidence, a great pride\nhad possessed them, a pride in one another for the greatness of the\nissues they had challenged. At first he had walked the room eloquent\nwith a transitory persuasion of his tremendous destiny. But slowly\nuneasy intimations of their coming defeat touched his spirit. There came\na long period in which they were alone. He changed his theme, became\negotistical, spoke of the wonder of his sleep, of the little life of his\nmemories, remote yet minute and clear, like something seen through an\ninverted opera-glass, and all the brief play of desires and errors that\nhad made his former life. She said little, but the emotion in her face\nfollowed the tones in his voice, and it seemed to him he had at last a\nperfect understanding. He reverted from pure reminiscence to that sense\nof greatness she imposed upon him. \"And through it all, this destiny was\nbefore me,\" he said; \"this vast inheritance of which I did not dream.\"\n\nInsensibly their heroic preoccupation with the revolutionary struggle\npassed to the question of their relationship. He began to question\nher. She told him of the days before his awakening, spoke with a brief\nvividness of the girlish dreams that had given a bias to her life, of\nthe incredulous emotions his awakening had aroused. She told him too\nof a tragic circumstance of her girlhood that had darkened her life,\nquickened her sense of injustice and opened her heart prematurely to\nthe wider sorrows of the world. For a little time, so far as he\nwas concerned, the great war about them was but the vast ennobling\nbackground to these personal things.\n\nIn an instant these personal relations were submerged. There came\nmessengers to tell that a great fleet of aeroplanes was rushing between\nthe sky and Avignon. He went to the crystal dial in the corner and\nassured himself that the thing was so. He went to the chart room and\nconsulted a map to measure the distances of Avignon, New Arawan, and\nLondon. He made swift calculations. He went to the room of the Ward\nLeaders to ask for news of the fight for the stages--and there was no\none there. After a time he came back to her.\n\nHis face had changed. It had dawned upon him that the struggle was\nperhaps more than half over, that Ostrog was holding his own, that\nthe arrival of the aeroplanes would mean a panic that might leave him\nhelpless. A chance phrase in the message had given him a glimpse of the\nreality that came. Each of these soaring giants bore its thousand\nhalf savage negroes to the death grapple of the city. Suddenly his\nhumanitarian enthusiasm showed flimsy. Only two of the Ward Leaders were\nin their room, when presently he repaired thither, the Hall of the Atlas\nseemed empty. He fancied a change in the bearing of the attendants in\nthe outer rooms. A sombre disillusionment darkened his mind. She looked\nat him anxiously when he returned to her.\n\n\"No news,\" he said with an assumed carelessness in answer to her eyes.\n\nThen he was moved to frankness. \"Or rather--bad news. We are losing. We\nare gaining no ground and the aeroplanes draw nearer and nearer.\"\n\nHe walked the length of the room and turned.\n\n\"Unless we can capture those flying stages in the next hour--there will\nbe horrible things. We shall be beaten.\n\n\"No!\" she said. \"We have justice--we have the people. We have God on our\nside.\"\n\n\"Ostrog has discipline--he has plans. Do you know, out there just now I\nfelt--. When I heard that these aeroplanes were a stage nearer. I felt\nas if I were fighting the machinery of fate.\"\n\nShe made no answer for a while. \"We have done right,\" she said at last.\n\nHe looked at her doubtfully. \"We have done what we could. But does this\ndepend upon us? Is it not an older sin, a wider sin?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" she asked.\n\n\"These blacks are savages, ruled by force, used as force. And they have\nbeen under the rule of the whites two hundred years. Is it not a race\nquarrel? The race sinned--the race pays.\"\n\n\"But these labourers, these poor people of London--!\"\n\n\"Vicarious atonement. To stand wrong is to share the guilt.\"\n\nShe looked keenly at him, astonished at the new aspect he presented.\n\nWithout came the shrill ringing of a bell, the sound of feet and the\ngabble of a phonographic message. The man in yellow appeared. \"Yes?\"\nsaid Graham.\n\n\"They are at Vichy.\"\n\n\"Where are the attendants who were in the great Hall of the Atlas?\"\nasked Graham abruptly.\n\nPresently the Babble Machine rang again. \"We may win yet,\" said the man\nin yellow, going out to it. \"If only we can find where Ostrog has hidden\nhis guns. Everything hangs on that now. Perhaps this--\"\n\nGraham followed him. But the only news was of the aeroplanes. They had\nreached Orleans.\n\nGraham returned to Helen. \"No news,\" he said \"No news.\"\n\n\"And we can do nothing?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\nHe paced impatiently. Suddenly the swift anger that was his nature swept\nupon him. \"Curse this complex world!\" he cried, \"and all the inventions\nof men! That a man must die like a rat in a snare and never see his foe!\nOh, for one blow!...\"\n\nHe turned with an abrupt change in his manner. \"That's nonsense,\" he\nsaid. \"I am a savage.\"\n\nHe paced and stopped. \"After all London and Paris are only two cities.\nAll the temperate zone has risen. What if London is doomed and Paris\ndestroyed? These are but accidents.\" Again came the mockery of news to\ncall him to fresh enquiries. He returned with a graver face and sat down\nbeside her.\n\n\"The end must be near,\" he said. \"The people it seems have fought and\ndied in tens of thousands, the ways about Roehampton must be like a\nsmoked beehive. And they have died in vain. They are still only at the\nsub stage. The aeroplanes are near Paris. Even were a gleam of success\nto come now, there would be nothing to do, there would be no time to do\nanything before they were upon us. The guns that might have saved us are\nmislaid. Mislaid! Think of the disorder of things! Think of this foolish\ntumult, that cannot even find its weapons! Oh, for one aeropile--just\none! For the want of that I am beaten. Humanity is beaten and our cause\nis lost! My kingship, my headlong foolish kingship will not last a\nnight. And I have egged on the people to fight--.\"\n\n\"They would have fought anyhow.\"\n\n\"I doubt it. I have come among them--\"\n\n\"No,\" she cried, \"not that. If defeat comes--if you die--. But even that\ncannot be, it cannot be, after all these years.\"\n\n\"Ah! We have meant well. But--do you indeed believe--?\"\n\n\"If they defeat you,\" she cried, \"you have spoken. Your word has gone\nlike a great wind through the world, fanning liberty into a flame. What\nif the flame sputters a little! Nothing can change the spoken word. Your\nmessage will have gone forth....\"\n\n\"To what end? It may be. It may be. You know I said, when you told me\nof these things dear God! but that was scarcely a score of hours ago!--I\nsaid that I had not your faith. Well--at any rate there is nothing to do\nnow....\"\n\n\"You have not my faith! Do you mean--? You are sorry?\"\n\n\"No,\" he said hurriedly, \"no! Before God--no!\" His voice changed.\n\"But--. I think--I have been indiscreet. I knew little--I grasped too\nhastily....\"\n\nHe paused. He was ashamed of this avowal. \"There is one thing that makes\nup for all. I have known you. Across this gulf of time I have come to\nyou. The rest is done. It is done. With you, too, it has been something\nmore--or something less--\"\n\nHe paused with his face searching hers, and without clamoured the\nunheeded message that the aeroplanes were rising into the sky of Amiens.\n\nShe put her hand to her throat, and her lips were white. She stared\nbefore her as if she saw some horrible possibility. Suddenly her\nfeatures changed. \"Oh, but I have been honest!\" she cried, and then,\n\"Have I been honest? I loved the world and freedom, I hated cruelty and\noppression. Surely it was that.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"yes. And we have done what it lay in us to do. We have\ngiven our message, our message! We have started Armageddon! But now--.\nNow that we have, it may be our last hour, together, now that all these\ngreater things are done....\"\n\nHe stopped. She sat in silence. Her face was a white riddle.\n\nFor a moment they heeded nothing of a sudden stir outside, a running\nto and fro, and cries. Then Helen started to an attitude of tense\nattention. \"It is--,\" she cried and stood up, speechless, incredulous,\ntriumphant. And Graham, too, heard. Metallic voices were shouting\n\"Victory!\" Yes it was \"Victory!\" He stood up also with the light of a\ndesperate hope in his eyes.\n\nBursting through the curtains appeared the man in yellow, startled and\ndishevelled with excitement. \"Victory,\" he cried, \"victory! The people\nare winning. Ostrog's people have collapsed.\"\n\nShe rose. \"Victory?\" And her voice was hoarse and faint.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Graham. \"Tell me! What?\"\n\n\"We have driven them out of the under galleries at Norwood, Streatham\nis afire and burning wildly, and Roehampton is ours. Ours!--and we have\ntaken the aeropile that lay thereon.\"\n\nFor an instant Graham and Helen stood in silence, their hearts were\nbeating fast, they looked at one another. For one last moment there\ngleamed in Graham his dream of empire, of kingship, with Helen by his\nside. It gleamed, and passed.\n\nA shrill bell rang. An agitated grey-headed man appeared from the room\nof the Ward Leaders. \"It is all over,\" he cried.\n\n\"What matters it now that we have Roehampton? The aeroplanes have been\nsighted at Boulogne!\"\n\n\"The Channel!\" said the man in yellow. He calculated swiftly. \"Half an\nhour.\"\n\n\"They still have three of the flying stages,\" said the old man.\n\n\"Those guns?\" cried Graham.\n\n\"We cannot mount them--in half an hour.\"\n\n\"Do you mean they are found?\"\n\n\"Too late,\" said the old man.\n\n\"If we could stop them another hour!\" cried the man in yellow.\n\n\"Nothing can stop them now,\" said the old man, \"they have near a hundred\naeroplanes in the first fleet.\"\n\n\"Another hour?\" asked Graham.\n\n\"To be so near!\" said the Ward Leader. \"Now that we have found those\nguns. To be so near--. If once we could get them out upon the roof\nspaces.\"\n\n\"How long would that take?\" asked Graham suddenly.\n\n\"An hour--certainly.\"\n\n\"Too late,\" cried the Ward Leader, \"too late.\"\n\n\"Is it too late?\" said Graham. \"Even now--. An hour!\"\n\nHe had suddenly perceived a possibility. He tried to speak calmly,\nbut his face was white. \"There is one chance. You said there was an\naeropile--?\"\n\n\"On the Roehampton stage, Sire.\"\n\n\"Smashed?\"\n\n\"No. It is lying crossways to the carrier. It might be got upon the\nguides--easily. But there is no aeronaut--.\"\n\nGraham glanced at the two men and then at Helen. He spoke after a long\npause. \"We have no aeronauts?\"\n\n\"None.\"\n\n\"The aeroplanes are clumsy,\" he said thoughtfully, \"compared with the\naeropiles.\"\n\nHe turned suddenly to Helen. His decision was made. \"I must do it.\"\n\n\"Do what?\"\n\n\"Go to this flying stage--to this aeropile.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I am an aeronaut. After all--. Those days for which you reproached me\nwere not wasted.\"\n\nHe turned to the old man in yellow. \"Put the aeropile upon the guides.\"\n\nThe man in yellow hesitated.\n\n\"What do you mean to do?\" cried Helen.\n\n\"This aeropile--it is a chance--.\"\n\n\"You don't mean--?\"\n\n\"To fight--yes. To fight in the air. I have thought before--. An\naeroplane is a clumsy thing. A resolute man--!\"\n\n\"But--never since flying began--\" cried the man in yellow.\n\n\"There has been no need. But now the time has come. Tell them now--send\nthem my message--to put it upon the guides.\"\n\nThe old man dumbly interrogated the man in yellow, nodded, and hurried\nout.\n\nHelen made a step towards Graham. Her face was white. \"But--How can one\nfight? You will be killed.\"\n\n\"Perhaps. Yet, not to do it--or to let someone else attempt it--.\"\n\nHe stopped, he could speak no more, he swept the alternative aside by a\ngesture, and they stood looking at one another.\n\n\"You are right,\" she said at last in a low tone. \"You are right. If it\ncan be done... must go.\"\n\nThose days for not altogether\n\nHe moved a step towards her, and she stepped back, her white face\nstruggled against him and resisted him. \"No,\" she gasped. \"I cannot\nbear--. Go now.\"\n\nHe extended his hands stupidly. She clenched her fists. \"Go now,\" she\ncried. \"Go now.\"\n\nHe hesitated and understood. He threw his hands up in a queer\nhalf-theatrical gesture. He had no word to say. He turned from her.\n\nThe man in yellow moved towards the door with clumsy belated tact. But\nGraham stepped past him. He went striding through the room where the\nWard Leader bawled at a telephone directing that the aeropile should be\nput upon the guides.\n\nThe man in yellow glanced at Helen's still figure, hesitated and hurried\nafter him. Graham did not once look back, he did not speak until the\ncurtain of the ante-chamber of the great hall fell behind him. Then he\nturned his head with curt swift directions upon his bloodless lips.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV. THE COMING OF THE AEROPLANES\n\nTwo men in pale blue were lying in the irregular line that stretched\nalong the edge of the captured Roehampton stage from end to end,\ngrasping their carbines and peering into the shadows of the stage called\nWimbledon Park. Now and then they spoke to one another. They spoke the\nmutilated English of their class and period. The fire of the Ostrogites\nhad dwindled and ceased, and few of the enemy had been seen for some\ntime. But the echoes of the fight that was going on now far below in\nthe lower galleries of that stage, came every now and then between the\nstaccato of shots from the popular side. One of these men was describing\nto the other how he had seen a man down below there dodge behind a\ngirder, and had aimed at a guess and hit him cleanly as he dodged too\nfar \"He's down there still,\" said the marksman. \"See that little patch.\nYes. Between those bars.\" A few yards behind them lay a dead stranger,\nface upward to the sky, with the blue canvas of his jacket smoldering\nin a circle about the neat bullet hole on his chest. Close beside him a\nwounded man, with a leg swathed about, sat with an expressionless face\nand watched the progress of that burning. Gigantic behind them, athwart\nthe carrier lay the captured aeropile.\n\n\"I can't see him now,\" said the second man in a ton of provocation.\n\nThe marksman became foul-mouthed and high-voiced in his earnest\nendeavour to make things plain And suddenly, interrupting him, came a\nnoisy shouting from the substage.\n\n\"What's going on now,\" he said, and raised himself on one arm to stare\nat the stairheads in the central groove of the stage. A number of blue\nfigures were coming up these, and swarming across the stage to the\naeropile.\n\n\"We don't want all these fools,\" said his friend. \"They only crowd up\nand spoil shots. What are they after?\"\n\n\"Ssh!--they're shouting something.\"\n\nThe two men listened. The swarming new-comers had crowded densely about\nthe aeropile. Three Ward Leaders, conspicuous by their black mantles and\nbadges, clambered into the body and appeared above it. The rank and file\nflung themselves upon the vans, gripping hold of the edges, until the\nentire outline of the thing was manned, in some places three deep. One\nof the marksmen knelt up. \"They're putting it on the carrier--that's\nwhat they're after.\"\n\nHe rose to his feet, his friend rose also. \"What's the good?\" said his\nfriend. \"We've got no aeronauts.\"\n\n\"That's what they're doing anyhow.\" He looked at his rifle, looked at\nthe struggling crowd, and suddenly turning to the wounded man. \"Mind\nthese, mate,\" he said, handing his carbine and cartridge belt; and in a\nmoment he was running towards the aeropile. For a quarter of an hour he\nwas a perspiring Titan, lugging, thrusting, shouting and heeding shouts,\nand then the thing was done, and he stood with a multitude of others\ncheering their own achievement. By this time he knew, what indeed\neveryone in the city knew, that the Master, raw learner though he\nwas, intended to fly this machine himself, was coming even now to take\ncontrol of it, would let no other man attempt it. \"He who takes the\ngreatest danger, he who bears the heaviest burden, that man is King,\"\nso the Master was reported to have spoken. And even as this man cheered,\nand while the beads of sweat still chased one another from the disorder\nof his hair, he heard the thunder of a greater tumult, and in fitful\nsnatches the beat and impulse of the revolutionary song. He saw through\na gap in the people that a thick stream of heads still poured up\nthe stairway. \"The Master is coming,\" shouted voices, \"the Master is\ncoming,\" and the crowd about him grew denser and denser. He began to\nthrust himself towards the central groove. \"The Master is coming!\" \"The\nSleeper, the Master!\" \"God and the Master!\" roared the Voices.\n\nAnd suddenly quite close to him were the black uniforms of the\nrevolutionary guard, and for the first and last time in his life he saw\nGraham, saw him quite nearly. A tall, dark man in a flowing black robe,\nwith a white, resolute face and eyes fixed steadfastly before him; a man\nwho for all the little things about him held neither ears nor eyes\nnor thoughts.... For all his days that man remembered the passing of\nGraham's bloodless face. In a moment it had gone and he was fighting\nin the swaying crowd. A lad weeping with terror thrust against him,\npressing towards the stairways, yelling \"Clear for the aeropile!\" The\nbell that clears the flying stage became a loud unmelodious clanging.\n\nWith that clanging in his ears Graham drew near the aeropile, marched\ninto the shadow of its tilting wing. He became aware that a number of\npeople about him were offering to accompany him, and waved their offers\naside. He wanted to think how one started the engine. The bell clanged\nfaster and faster, and the feet of the retreating people roared faster\nand louder. The man in yellow was assisting him to mount through the\nribs of the body. He clambered into the aeronaut's place, fixing himself\nvery carefully and deliberately. What was it? The man in yellow was\npointing to two aeropiles driving upward in the southern sky. No doubt\nthey were looking for the coming aeroplanes. That--presently--the thing\nto do now was to start. Things were being shouted at him, questions,\nwarnings. They bothered him. He wanted to think about the aeropile, to\nrecall every item of his previous experience. He waved the people from\nhim, saw the man in yellow dropping off through the ribs, saw the crowd\ncleft down the line of the girders by his gesture.\n\nFor a moment he was motionless, staring at the levers, the wheel by\nwhich the engine shifted, and all the delicate appliances of which he\nknew so little. His eye caught a spirit level with the bubble towards\nhim, and he remembered something, spent a dozen seconds in swinging the\nengine forward until the bubble floated in the centre of the tube.\nHe noted that the people were not shouting, knew they watched his\ndeliberation. A bullet smashed on the bar above his head. Who fired? Was\nthe line clear of people? He stood up to see and sat down again.\n\nIn another second the propeller was spinning, and he was rushing down\nthe guides. He gripped the wheel and swung the engine back to lift the\nstem. Then it was the people shouted. In a moment he was throbbing with\nthe quiver of the engine, and the shouts dwindled swiftly behind, rushed\ndown to silence. The wind whistled over the edges of the screen, and the\nworld sank away from him very swiftly.\n\nThrob, throb, throb--throb, throb, throb; up he drove. He fancied\nhimself free of all excitement, felt cool and deliberate. He lifted the\nstem still more, opened one valve on his left wing and swept round and\nup. He looked down with a steady head, and up. One of the Ostrogite\naeropiles was driving across his course, so that he drove obliquely\ntowards it and would pass below it at a steep angle. Its little\naeronauts were peering down at him. What did they mean to do? His mind\nbecame active. One, he saw held a weapon pointing, seemed prepared to\nfire. What did they think he meant to do? In a moment he understood\ntheir tactics, and his resolution was taken. His momentary lethargy was\npast. He opened two more valves to his left, swung round, end on to this\nhostile machine, closed his valves, and shot straight at it, stem and\nwind-screen shielding him from the shot. They tilted a little as if to\nclear him. He flung up his stem.\n\nThrob, throb, throb--pause--throb, throb--he set his teeth, his face\ninto an involuntary grimace, and crash! He struck it! He struck upward\nbeneath the nearer wing.\n\nVery slowly the wing of his antagonist seemed to broaden as the impetus\nof his blow turned it up. He saw the full breadth of it and then it slid\ndownward out of his sight.\n\nHe felt his stem going down, his hands tightened on the levers, whirled\nand rammed the engine back. He felt the jerk of a clearance, the nose\nof the machine jerked upward steeply, and for a moment he seemed to be\nlying on his back. The machine was reeling and staggering, it seemed to\nbe dancing on its screw. He made a huge effort, hung for a moment on the\nlevers, and slowly the engine came forward again. He was driving upward\nbut no longer so steeply. He gasped for a moment and flung himself at\nthe levers again. The wind whistled about him. One further effort and\nhe was almost level. He could breathe. He turned his head for the first\ntime to see what had become of his antagonists. Turned back to the\nlevers for a moment and looked again. For a moment he could have\nbelieved they were annihilated. And then he saw between the two stages\nto the east was a chasm, and down this something, a slender edge, fell\nswiftly and vanished, as a sixpence falls down a crack.\n\nAt first he did not understand, and then a wild joy possessed him. He\nshouted at the top of his voice, an inarticulate shout, and drove higher\nand higher up the sky. Throb, throb, throb, pause, throb, throb, throb.\n\"Where was the other aeropile?\" he thought. \"They too--.\" As he looked\nround the empty heavens he had a momentary fear that this machine had\nrisen above him, and then he saw it alighting on the Norwood stage. They\nhad meant shooting. To risk being rammed headlong two thousand feet in\nthe air was beyond their latter-day courage. The combat was declined.\n\nFor a little while he circled, then swooped in a steep descent towards\nthe westward stage. Throb throb throb, throb throb throb. The twilight\nwas creeping on apace, the smoke from the Streatham stage that had been\nso dense and dark, was now a pillar of fire, and all the laced curves\nof the moving ways and the translucent roofs and domes and the chasms\nbetween the buildings were glowing softly now, lit by the tempered\nradiance of the electric light that the glare of the way overpowered.\nThe three efficient stages that the Ostrogites held--for Wimbledon Park\nwas useless because of the fire from Roehampton, and Streatham was a\nfurnace--were glowing with guide lights for the coming aeroplanes. As\nhe swept over the Roehampton stage he saw the dark masses of the people\nthereon. He heard a clap of frantic cheering, heard a bullet from the\nWimbledon Park stage tweet through the air, and went beating up above\nthe Surrey wastes. He felt a breath of wind from the south-west, and\nlifted his westward wing as he had learnt to do, and so drove upward\nheeling into the rare swift upper air. Throb throb throb--throb throb\nthrob.\n\nUp he drove and up, to that pulsating rhythm, until the country beneath\nwas blue and indistinct, and London spread like a little map traced in\nlight, like the mere model of a city near the brim of the horizon. The\nsouth-west was a sky of sapphire over the shadowy rim of the world, and\never as he drove upward the multitude of stars increased.\n\nAnd behold! In the southward, low down and glittering swiftly nearer,\nwere two little patches of nebulous light. And then two more, and then a\nnebulous glow of swiftly driving shapes. Presently he could count them.\nThere were four and twenty. The first fleet of aeroplanes had come!\nBeyond appeared a yet greater glow.\n\nHe swept round in a half circle, staring at this advancing fleet.\nIt flew in a wedge-like shape, a triangular flight of gigantic\nphosphorescent shapes sweeping nearer through the lower air. He made a\nswift calculation of their pace, and spun the little wheel that brought\nthe engine forward. He touched a lever and the throbbing effort of the\nengine ceased. He began to fall, fell swifter and swifter. He aimed at\nthe apex of the wedge. He dropped like a stone through the whistling\nair. It seemed scarce a second from that soaring moment before he struck\nthe foremost aeroplane.\n\nNo man of all that black multitude saw the coming of his fate, no man\namong them dreamt of the hawk that struck downward upon him out of\nthe sky. Those who were not limp in the agonies of air-sickness, were\ncraning their black necks and staring to see the filmy city that was\nrising out of the haze, the rich and splendid city to which \"Massa Boss\"\nhad brought their obedient muscles. Bright teeth gleamed and the glossy\nfaces shone. They had heard of Paris. They knew they were to have lordly\ntimes among the \"poor white\" trash. And suddenly Graham struck them.\n\nHe had aimed at the body of the aeroplane, but at the very last instant\na better idea had flashed into his mind. He twisted about and struck\nnear the edge of the starboard wing with all his accumulated weight. He\nwas jerked back as he struck. His prow went gliding across its smooth\nexpanse towards the rim. He felt the forward rush of the huge fabric\nsweeping him and his aeropile along with it, and for a moment that\nseemed an age he could not tell what was happening. He heard a thousand\nthroats yelling, and perceived that his machine was balanced on the edge\nof the gigantic float, and driving down, down; glanced over his shoulder\nand saw the backbone of the aeroplane and the opposite float swaying up.\nHe had a vision through the ribs of sliding chairs, staring faces, and\nhands clutching at the tilting guide bars. The fenestrations in the\nfurther float flashed open as the aeronaut tried to right her. Beyond,\nhe saw a second aeroplane leaping steeply to escape the whirl of its\nheeling fellow. The broad area of swaying wings seemed to jerk upward.\nHe felt his aeropile had dropped clear, that the monstrous fabric, clean\noverturned, hung like a sloping wall above him.\n\nHe did not clearly understand that he had struck the side float of the\naeroplane and slipped off, but he perceived that he was flying free on\nthe down glide and rapidly nearing earth. What had he done? His heart\nthrobbed like a noisy engine in his throat and for a perilous instant\nhe could not move his levers because of the paralysis of his hands. He\nwrenched the levers to throw his engine back, fought for two seconds\nagainst the weight of it, felt himself righting driving horizontally,\nset the engine beating again.\n\nHe looked upward and saw two aeroplanes glide shouting far overhead,\nlooked back, and saw the main body of the fleet opening out and rushing\nupward and outward; saw the one he had struck fall edgewise on and\nstrike like a gigantic knife-blade along the wind-wheels below it.\n\nHe put down his stern and looked again. He drove up heedless of his\ndirection as he watched. He saw the wind-vanes give, saw the huge fabric\nstrike the earth, saw its downward vans crumple with the weight of its\ndescent, and then the whole mass turned over and smashed, upside down,\nupon the sloping wheels. Throb, throb, throb, pause. Suddenly from\nthe heaving wreckage a thin tongue of white fire licked up towards the\nzenith. And then he was aware of a huge mass flying through the air\ntowards him, and turned upwards just in time to escape the charge--if\nit was a charge--of a second aeroplane. It whirled by below, sucked\nhim down a fathom, and nearly turned him over in the gust of its close\npassage.\n\nHe became aware of three others rushing towards him, aware of the urgent\nnecessity of beating above them. Aeroplanes were all about him, circling\nwildly to avoid him, as it seemed. They drove past him, above, below,\neastward and westward. Far away to the westward was the sound of a\ncollision, and two falling flares. Far away to the southward a second\nsquadron was coming. Steadily he beat upward. Presently all the\naeroplanes were below him, but for a moment he doubted the height he had\nof them, and did not swoop again. And then he came down upon a second\nvictim and all its load of soldiers saw him coming. The big machine\nheeled and swayed as the fear maddened men scrambled to the stern\nfor their weapons. A score of bullets sung through the air, and there\nflashed a star in the thick glass wind-screen that protected him. The\naeroplane slowed and dropped to foil his stroke, and dropped too low.\nJust in time he saw the wind-wheels of Bromley hill rushing up towards\nhim, and spun about and up as the aeroplane he had chased crashed among\nthem. All its voices wove into a felt of yelling. The great fabric\nseemed to be standing on end for a second among the heeling and\nsplintering vans, and then it flew to pieces. Huge splinters came flying\nthrough the air, its engines burst like shells. A hot rush of flame shot\noverhead into the darkling sky.\n\n\"_Two!_\" he cried, with a bomb from overhead bursting as it fell, and\nforthwith he was beating up again. A glorious exhilaration possessed\nhim now, a giant activity. His troubles about humanity, about his\ninadequacy, were gone for ever. He was a man in battle rejoicing in his\npower. Aeroplanes seemed radiating from him in every direction, intent\nonly upon avoiding him, the yelling of their packed passengers came in\nshort gusts as they swept by. He chose his third quarry, struck hastily\nand did but turn it on edge. It escaped him, to smash against the tall\ncliff of London wall. Flying from that impact he skimmed the darkling\nground so nearly he could see a frightened rabbit bolting up a slope. He\njerked up steeply, and found himself driving over south London with the\nair about him vacant. To the right of him a wild riot of signal rockets\nfrom the Ostrogites banged tumultuously in the sky. To the south the\nwreckage of half a dozen air ships flamed, and east and west and north\nthe air ships fled before him. They drove away to the east and north,\nand went about in the south, for they could not pause in the air.\nIn their present confusion any attempt at evolution would have meant\ndisastrous collisions. He could scarcely realize the thing he had done.\nIn every quarter aeroplanes were receding. They were receding. They\ndwindled smaller and smaller. They were in flight!\n\nHe passed two hundred feet or so above the Roehampton stage. It was\nblack with people and noisy with their frantic shouting. But why was\nthe Wimbledon Park stage black and cheering, too? The smoke and flame of\nStreatham now hid the three further stages. He curved about and rose\nto see them and the northern quarters. First came the square masses of\nShooter's Hill into sight from behind the smoke, lit and orderly with\nthe aeroplane that had landed and its disembarking negroes. Then came\nBlackheath, and then under the corner of the reek the Norwood stage. On\nBlackheath no aeroplane had landed but an aeropile lay upon the guides.\nNorwood was covered by a swarm of little figures running to and fro in a\npassionate confusion. Why? Abruptly he understood. The stubborn\ndefence of the flying stages was over, the people were pouring into the\nunder-ways of these last strongholds of Ostrog's usurpation. And then,\nfrom far away on the northern border of the city, full of glorious\nimport to him, came a sound, a signal, a note of triumph, the leaden\nthud of a gun. His lips fell apart, his face was disturbed with emotion.\n\nHe drew an immense breath. \"They win,\" he shouted to the empty air; \"the\npeople win!\" The sound of a second gun came like an answer. And then he\nsaw the aeropile on Blackheath was running down its guides to launch.\nIt lifted clean and rose. It shot up into the air, driving straight\nsouthward and away from him.\n\nIn an instant it came to him what this meant. It must needs be Ostrog\nin flight. He shouted and dropped towards it. He had the momentum of\nhis elevation and fell slanting down the air and very swiftly. It rose\nsteeply at his approach. He allowed for its velocity and drove straight\nupon it.\n\nIt suddenly became a mere flat edge, and behold! he was past it, and\ndriving headlong down with all the force of his futile blow.\n\nHe was furiously angry. He reeled the engine back along its shaft and\nwent circling up. He saw Ostrog's machine beating up a spiral before\nhim. He rose straight towards it, won above it by virtue of the impetus\nof his swoop and by the advantage and weight of a man. He dropped\nheadlong--dropped and missed again! As he rushed past he saw the face of\nOstrog's aeronaut confident and cool and in Ostrog's attitude a wincing\nresolution. Ostrog was looking steadfastly away from him--to the south.\nHe realized with a gleam of wrath how bungling his flight must be. Below\nhe saw the Croyden hills. He jerked upward and once more he gained on\nhis enemy.\n\nHe glanced over his shoulder and his attention was arrested by a strange\nthing. The eastward stage, the one on Shooter's Hill, appeared to lift;\na flash changing to a tall grey shape, a cowled figure of smoke and\ndust, jerked into the air. For a moment this cowled figure stood\nmotionless, dropping huge masses of metal from its shoulders, and then\nit began to uncoil a dense head of smoke. The people had blown it up,\naeroplane and all! As suddenly a second flash and grey shape sprang\nup from the Norwood stage. And even as he stared at this came a dead\nreport, and the air wave of the first explosion struck him. He was flung\nup and sideways.\n\nFor a moment the aeropile fell nearly edgewise with her nose down,\nand seemed to hesitate whether to overset altogether. He stood on his\nwind-shield wrenching the wheel that swayed up over his head. And then\nthe shock of the second explosion took his machine sideways.\n\nHe found himself clinging to one of the ribs of his machine, and the air\nwas blowing past him and upward. He seemed to be hanging quite still in\nthe air, with the wind blowing up past him. It occurred to him that he\nwas falling. Then he was sure that he was falling. He could not look\ndown.\n\nHe found himself recapitulating with incredible swiftness all that had\nhappened since his awakening, the days of doubt the days of Empire, and\nat last the tumultuous discovery of Ostrog's calculated treachery, he\nwas beaten but London was saved. London was saved!\n\nThe thought had a quality of utter unreality. Who was he? Why was he\nholding so tightly with his hands? Why could he not leave go? In such\na fall as this countless dreams have ended. But in a moment he would\nwake....\n\nHis thoughts ran swifter and swifter. He wondered if he should see Helen\nagain. It seemed so unreasonable that he should not see her again. It\n_must_ be a dream! Yet surely he would meet her. She at least was real.\nShe was real. He would wake and meet her.\n\nAlthough he could not look at it, he was suddenly aware that the earth\nwas very near.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's When the Sleeper Wakes, by Herbert George Wells\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK WHEN THE SLEEPER WAKES ***\n\n***** This file should be named 775.txt or 775.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/7/7/775/\n\nProduced by John Bean\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
