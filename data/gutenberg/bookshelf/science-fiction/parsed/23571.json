In the distance a sharp rock formation stood revealed like\nan etching: a castle of iron-gray stone whose form had been carved by\nalien winds and eroded by acid tears from acid clouds.\n\nFar above was a halo where the sun should be. The sun was an orange star\nonly slightly larger than Sol and as near to Miracastle as Sol to Earth.\nThe orange rays splintered against the fog and gloom was perpetually\nupon the dark face of existence.\n\nThis was the first two-stage planet man had ever attempted to colonize.\nMiracastle was so far from Earth that the long ships were destroyed\ntwice to reach it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe technicians came, commanded by General Max Shorter, sixty-three\nyears old. Men wearing the circle whose diameter was etched in ruby\nsteel enclosing a background of gleaming ebon--the emblem was a silver D\nover a sunburst of hammered gold.\n\nThe surface of Miracastle roiled with unfamiliar storms and tornados and\nhurricanes. Before these, the films of lichen evaporated into dust, and\nthe sparse and stunted vegetation with ochre foliage turned sear and was\npowdered by the fury in the air.\n\nEarth equipment, alien to the orange sun, hammered into the heart of\nMiracastle. Night and day it converted the pulverized substance of the\nplanet in the white-hot core of its atomic furnaces.\n\nAcid rivers snapped at the wind and changed to salt deposits and\nsuper-heated steam. In the gaseous atmosphere, neutral crystals formed\nand fell like powdered rain. Miracastle heated and cooled and shivered\nwith the virus of man-made chemical reactions, and the storms screamed\nand tore at the age-old mountains.\n\nInside the eternal, self-renewing Richardson domes, the technicians\nworked and waited and superintended the computers which controlled the\nprocesses raging beyond them.\n\nThe long ship lifted steadily and majestically through the battering\nstorm and the driving rain of dust and crystals. Out beyond the dense\nspace that surrounds all stars, the long ship probed the ever-shifting\ncurrents in the four-dimensional universe. The long ship found a\nlow-density flaw, where space could hardly be said to exist at all. The\nlong ship, described mathematically, was half as long as the\ncontinuum--the length being inversely proportional and related only to\nmass. Time was but a moth's wing between twin cliffs of eternity.\n\nInside Miracastle's orange sun, at its very core, an atom of hydrogen\nwas destroyed completely; and in the inconceivable distance, an atom of\nhydrogen appeared. The pulsing, steady-state equation of the universe\nmaintained its knife-edge and inevitable thermo-dynamic balance.\n\nInside the long ship, a pilot-machine ordered the destruction of a\nvastly greater collection of matter. The atoms of the ship and the\nsailors--fixed in relationship, each to each--imploded into nothingness.\n\nAnd the long ship and the men aboard it were born again at a low-density\narea a million light years away--halfway to Earth. Born and were\ndestroyed again, in the blink of an eye.\n\nBeyond the ship now lay Sol, pulsing in its own warmth and warming its\nchildren embedded in the cold and distant texture of the universe. The\nsailors were ghosts come home.\n\nMiracastle was alone with her conquerors.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGeneral Max Shorter, a few weeks later, began writing a diary.\n\n\"I have been Destroyed thirty-seven times during forty years' service\nwith the long ships,\" he wrote. He wrote with a pen, using a metal\nstraight edge as a line rule.\n\n\"I have served faithfully and I believe as well as any man the Corps,\nthe planet and mankind. It is perhaps appropriate at this time, as I\napproach the end of my long service, to record a few observations which\nhave occurred to me during the course of it as well as to record the\nday-to-day details of my present command.\"\n\nThe general wrote: \"A man is given a job to do. And when all is said and\ndone, that is the most important thing in his life: to do his job.\"\n\nIt took perhaps ten seconds for the soft knock to penetrate his\nconcentration. He adjusted himself to the moment and closed the diary\nsoftly. He deposited it in the upper right-hand drawer of the writing\ndesk and locked the drawer.\n\nThe knock came again.\n\nHe arranged his tie.\n\n\"Come in,\" General Shorter said.\n\nThe agitation of the man in the doorway was announced by the paleness of\nhis face.\n\n\"Come in, David,\" General Shorter said, rising politely from the writing\ndesk. \"Be seated, please.\"\n\n\"General, we've had a ... a very unfortunate thing happen on the shift.\"\n\nThe general sank back into his chair. Light from the desk lamp framed\nhis expressionless and immobile face, half in light, half in shadow. He\nfingered the straight-edge on the desk top.\n\n\"Sit down, David, and then tell me about it.\"\n\nShift-Captain Arnold moved uncertainly.\n\n\"Sit down, sit down,\" General Shorter repeated impatiently.\n\nCaptain Arnold seated himself on the edge of the chair.\n\n\"One of the men,\" he said, \"just committed suicide. He was in charge of\nthe air changing monitor this shift. He went outside without a suit.\"\n\nThe general blinked as though to remove an irritation from his eye. His\nhand lay still and hard upon the straight-edge. \"What was his name?\" he\nasked in a voice that was vaguely puzzled.\n\n\"Schuster. Sergeant Schuster, sir.\"\n\n\"Yes, I remember him,\" the general said. \"He came to us about a week\nbefore the lift. I think he was from Colorado. He had very broad\nshoulders. Short and broad. Neat appearing. Uniform always in good\norder.\"\n\nGeneral Shorter ran his thumb and forefinger up the bridge of his nose\nand then, with a very small sigh, placed his palm over his eyes.\n\n\"Draw up the report,\" he said. \"Was there a final message?\" The question\nwas uttered without hesitation and was followed by a moment of silence.\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\nGeneral Shorter's breath was audible.\n\n\"Please feel free to smoke, David.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir, I don't smoke.\"\n\n\"No, of course not. I'd forgotten.\" General Shorter half turned and\nplaced his hands on the desk. He stood under their pressure. \"What would\nyou say to a brandy?\"\n\n\"I should return to duty, sir.\"\n\n\"A few minutes more,\" the general said. \"The brandy is good.\" He moved\ninto the shadow and sorted bottles at his tiny cupboard. \"Here.\" He held\nthe glass to the light. Amber liquid flowed softly and the general\nhanded across the half-filled glass. \"Sit back,\" he said. \"I'll join\nyou.\"\n\nGlass in hand, the general stood with his back to the light. He seemed\nsurrounded by cold fire, and the glass sparkled as he lifted it. He\nsipped. \"Try it, it's good.\"\n\n\"It's very good, sir.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a moment neither spoke. Then the general said, \"This isn't my first\ncommand, you know. I've seen men die. I've had to take chances with them\noccasionally. You could say, I suppose, that I ordered some men to their\ndeaths. But still, the men came aboard knowing the risks. In the final\nsense, they, not I, made the decision. I never sent a--\"\n\nThe sentence ended as the glass slipped and fell. \"I'm sorry,\" he said,\nlooking down at the sparkling fragments at his feet. The dark\nliquid--the light gave it a reddish cast--puddled and flowed and its\naroma filled the room. \"No, no. Let it be, David. I'll get it later.\"\n\nThe general went to the cupboard and poured into a new glass. Again he\nwas light and shadow. The spilled liquid approached the shadow and was\ndevoured in it as though it had never been, but still the aroma stood on\nthe air.\n\nThe general said: \"Imagine, if you can, David, that Earth were attacked,\nand the attack destroyed many of the military installations. After you\nstruck back, David, what would you do next?\"\n\n\"I don't know, sir. I'm not a strategist, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\"What about your cities? The millions of people trapped without\nsupplies--over-running the countryside, looting, plundering in search of\nfood. Carrying pestilence and disease and terror. What would you do,\nDavid?\"\n\n\"Well, I guess I'd try to organize some relief organization or\nsomething.\"\n\n\"But David. Anything you diverted to care for these people would limit\nyour ability to fight back, wouldn't it? They would be cluttering up all\nyour transportation, frustrating effective retaliation. Your second move\nwould be to take the bombs which destroy people and not property and ...\nuse them on your own cities.\"\n\nCaptain Arnold drained his glass. \"That would be....\" He did not finish.\n\n\"Insane, David? No. Rational. Field Commanders must be realists. The job\ncomes first. In this case, the job of defeating the enemy.... But what\ndoes that have to do with us? Nothing, eh? You're right. Sometimes I\nlike to talk, and I suppose that's one of my privileges. I'm not the\nidealist I used to be, I guess. I remember when I was your age. I saw\nthings differently than I do now. What used to seem important no longer\ndoes. Each stage of development has its unique biological imperatives: a\nchild, a youth, a mature man, look out on the world from a body held in\nfocus to different chemistries. But the job remains.\" General Shorter\nheld up his glass. \"Cheers.\" He drained it.\n\nAgain there was silence.\n\n\"David, do you think I'm in much trouble?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid so, General. The Committee is due to arrive tomorrow.\"\n\n\"I know,\" the general said. \"This suicide isn't going to help us.\nTomorrow. Is it that soon? I thought ... yes, I guess it is tomorrow....\nWell, we've been here long enough to lose our immunity, so we'll all\ncatch colds.\"\n\nCaptain Arnold stood. \"I better get started on my report.\"\n\n\"Poor Sergeant Schuster,\" General Shorter said. \"If anyone's to blame,\nit must be me.\"\n\n\"He obeyed the orders.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\"\n\n\"I said he obeyed the orders, sir.\"\n\n\"Of course he obeyed the orders,\" the general said. \"What else could he\nhave done?\"\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nThe long ship hung in orbit above Miracastle and discharged its\npassengers. The Scout Ball could handle them: saving energy, which along\nwith time itself, is the ultimate precious commodity of the universe\ngoverned by the laws of entropy.\n\nThe Scout Ball settled through the dark turbulence undisturbed by the\nhissing winds. It hovered momentarily in the invisible beacon above the\nRichardson dome as if both attracted and repelled. It moved horizontally\nand settled. Suited figures on the surface wrestled with its flexible\nexit-tube against the storm, fighting to couple it to the lock of the\nRichardson dome. The exit-tube moved rhythmically until the Scout Ball\ninched away, drawing it taut. Pumps whirred. The suited figures entered\nthe forward lock of the Scout Ball.\n\nInside, General Shorter divested himself of the helmet. The suit hung\nupon him like ancient, wrinkled skin.\n\nHe asked, \"What time is it?\"\n\nUpon being told, he nodded with satisfaction. \"Seventeen minutes, total.\nGood job. Who's in charge?\"\n\n\"A Mr. Tucker, sir.\"\n\n\"Tucker? Jim Tucker, by any chance?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nGeneral Shorter grunted. \"Served with him once. He's probably\nforgotten.... That's all right. I'll keep the suit on.\"\n\n\"I don't think they're expecting you with the surface party, General.\"\n\n\"Probably not or they'd be here. Earth crew?\"\n\n\"They've been out ten months or so, sir.\"\n\n\"We will have colds, then. Would you take me to Mr. Tucker, please?\" To\nthe other suited men he said, \"Good, fast job.\"\n\nGeneral Shorter followed the crewman up the spiral staircase and along\nthe corridor. His hand touched a frictionless wall. \"New plastic?\"\n\n\"This is one of the most recent balls, sir.\"\n\n\"How does it handle?\"\n\n\"Quite well, sir.\"\n\n\"I miss the Model Ten,\" he said.\n\n\"There's only a few left now, I guess.\"\n\n\"I haven't seen one in years.\"\n\nThe crewman stopped before a numberless panel. He knocked politely. \"Mr.\nTucker? I have General Shorter here. He came out with the surface\nparty.\"\n\nMr. Tucker's voice, the edge of surprise partly lost through the\npartition, came: \"Just a moment.\"\n\nIn silence they waited. General Shorter moved restlessly. Several\nminutes passed.\n\nThe panel opened.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMr. Tucker was a short, rotund man. His close-cropped hair was graying,\nalthough his face was unlined, with the smooth complexion of a child.\nHis irises were gray and gold.\n\nGeneral Shorter stepped forward and introduced himself.\n\n\"Come in.\"\n\nThe panel closed.\n\nThe two men stood. General Shorter glanced around for a chair.\n\n\"Small quarters,\" Mr. Tucker said. \"If you like, sit there. I'll sit on\nthe bed.\"\n\nThey arranged themselves.\n\n\"Perhaps you don't remember me?\" the general said. \"We served\ntogether--what, ten years ago?--for about two weeks on Avalon, I believe\nit was.\"\n\n\"Yes, I thought that was the case. You have a good memory, General.\"\n\n\"Please,\" the general said, \"just call me Max.\"\n\nMr. Tucker considered, without committing himself. He proffered a cigar.\nThe general declined.\n\nMr. Tucker lighted the cigar carefully, moving the flame several times\nacross the blunt end. He regarded the results without expression. \"A\ncigar should be properly lit, General,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes, yes, I suppose so,\" the general said. He paused to worry at a\nwrinkle on his suit. \"Good trip out?\"\n\n\"Routine.\"\n\n\"New ship? I notice this is one of the new Balls.\"\n\n\"Mark Six.\"\n\n\"Ah, those. I've always liked the Mark Six. Solid construction. I've\nbeen Destroyed maybe half the time in the Mark Sixes. Each one of the\nMarks has its own personality--I've always thought so. I don't suppose\nyou remember the old Mark Two? That was a long time ago. I've been\naround. We got lost in one once. It picked a pseudo-fault line and ...\nwell, never mind. Earth the same, I guess?\"\n\n\"Hasn't changed.\"\n\n\"I don't know when I'll get back,\" the general said. The statement\nseemed to dangle as though it were an unfinished question.\n\n\"The new detectors have put Miracastle on the fringe of things.\"\n\n\"I've followed the work,\" the general said. \"I try to keep up. It\ninvolves a new concept of mass variation, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"It just about makes it uneconomical to colonize a two-stage planet any\nmore. Or to keep one going.\"\n\nThe general's eyelids flickered. His body moved beneath the wrinkled\nfolds of the surface suit. Cigar smoke curled in the still air.\n\nMr. Tucker said, \"You must have been aware that it would not have been a\ngreat loss to have evacuated Miracastle.\"\n\nThe general shuffled in silence. \"Yes, sir, I knew the background. It's\npart of my job to know things like that. You'll find, sir, that I have a\nstrong sense of responsibility. If it's part of my job, I'll know about\nit.\"\n\nGeneral Max Shorter abruptly stood and for a moment was motionless, a\nman deformed and diminished in stature by the ill-fitting surface suit.\nExpressionless, he looked down, without psychological advantage, at the\nseated civilian holding the partially smoked cigar.\n\nLater the same day, Mr. Tucker and two of the three other members of the\nCommittee donned surface suits and, together with Captain Meford, the\ncartographer assigned to Miracastle, they boarded the surface scout.\n\nThey arranged themselves in the uncomfortable bucket seats and strapped\nin.\n\n\"Little early for an easy ride,\" Mr. Tucker commented.\n\n\"I've been out before,\" Captain Meford said laconically. It was his\nusual manner.\n\n\"How long do you think it will take us to get there?\"\n\n\"Between fifteen and twenty minutes, if I don't hit too much cross\nwind.\"\n\nMr. Ryan, one of the other two civilians, commented, \"A long time\nbetween cigars, eh, Jim?\"\n\nThe question was out of place and was ignored without hostility.\n\nMr. Ryan twisted uncomfortably. At length he said, apologetically,\n\"Dirty, filthy business. I wish it were over with.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" Mr. Tucker said.\n\nCaptain Meford activated the ramp and eased the scout out. It was\nimmediately buffeted by the winds.\n\n\"Sorry,\" he said. \"It'll take a minute. Hold tight.\" The scout moved in\nthree dimensions, erratically. \"Wow! Let's set it at about twenty-six\ninches. Sorry. This will slow us down, but it will ease the bumps on\ndown draft. There. That's better. We're okay now, I think. I guess we\ncan settle back.\"\n\nThirty-five minutes later, they came to what was left of the alien city.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBack in the Richardson dome, General Shorter had coffee, in his\nquarters, with the remaining man on the Committee, a Mr. Flison. They\nwere going through the ritual of conversation.\n\n\"This is the first time you've been Destroyed then, sir,\" the general\nsaid. \"My first time was so long ago I've forgotten what it feels like.\"\n\n\"I was uneasy in advance,\" Mr. Flison said. \"You read various\ndescriptions about the physical sensations. Intellectually, of course,\nyou draw a distinction, but emotionally you know that the only word\nwhich applies is death--pure and simple. But there's no sensation. It\nhappens too fast. You don't even notice it.\"\n\nPolitely attentive, the general had leaned forward. \"I don't think it\ncould be put better,\" he contributed. \"That's very apt. You don't even\nnotice it.\"\n\nMr. Flison's eyes narrowed in speculation. They maintained the general's\nown in unwavering focus. He did not acknowledge the compliment.\n\nThe general's eyes broke to one side. He moved nervously as though\nphysically to dismiss the tactical error of underestimating his\nopponent.\n\n\"Since this is your first planet,\" the general said, \"perhaps you'd like\nto see something of the operation? Basically, we have nine Richardson\nDomes here on Miracastle. Two are the living quarters--the other similar\nto this. Right now domes Seven and Nine are the more important. They\ncontain the air-changing equipment. We are holding tightly to our\ncompletion date, and these two--Seven and Nine--will be pulled out in\nfifteen days. That is to say, they will, barring any serious\ninterruptions in our work. On schedule, I should point out.\"\n\nThe general poured coffee for himself. Mr. Flison politely declined.\n\n\"When you've been in the Corps as long as I have,\" the general resumed,\n\"the schedule becomes a part of you. Everything--\" he held his hands\nbefore him, fingers spread, palms facing, and drew them\ntogether--\"converges on that. It's that simple. Other planets are\nwaiting. In a society as complex as ours, a million--and I mean this\nliterally, sir--a million decisions must be reviewed if the schedule\nfalls behind. Delay of a critical item of equipment can necessitate an\nunbelievably vast reassignment of personnel and supply patterns. A small\ncause reverberates throughout the whole fabric of the space technology.\"\n\n\"General Shorter, I think perhaps you're being carried away a little.\nI'm sure we have adequate procedures to accommodate minor variations in\nequipment delivery dates. If we don't, the Lord help us: we'd have been\ndead long ago.\"\n\nThe general was in the process of forming an immediate reply, but he\nreconsidered. When he reached for the coffee, which by now was cool and\nbitter, his hand was trembling.\n\nThe general licked his lips. \"More coffee? No? Well, I didn't intend to\nget off on this. I really wanted to ask if you'd like to inspect our\noperations.\" He glanced at his time piece. \"I could show you the present\nshift operation in Dome Nine.\"\n\nMr. Flison rose. \"No, General, I don't want to be of any bother. I\nwouldn't want to interfere with your--work.\"\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\n\"City\" is not necessarily descriptive: perhaps less so than the\napplication of Euclidean axioms to advanced geometry. Physically, it was\nthis:\n\n1. Three dozen stone arches whose keystones were inverted bowls.\n\n2. A smooth-walled recess in the sheer face of a cliff.\n\n3. A level lip of rock, as precisely flat as though honed, from which\nthe arches seemed to grow.\n\n\"Is this all?\" Mr. Tucker asked.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Captain Meford said.\n\nMr. Ryan came to the viewing section. \"It looks,\" he said, \"as though\nthe cliff were split down to here and then hewn away to leave the\nstructures there and the apron.\"\n\n\"We found no tools, sir. There were no tools here, nor with them.\"\n\n\"Nothing else at all?\"\n\n\"They left behind some four hundred chips of stone, apparently numbered.\nWe have them in the dome. And there's a two-line inscription on one of\nthe arches. There's nothing else.\"\n\nHigh above the men and the ship, the new wind sang in one of the\ninverted bowls and fluttered lightly over the inscription. It, like the\nface of the cliff, was oxidizing. Dust filtered down before the recess,\nalien symbols falling. Life is the recording angel of time. Without\nlife, all ceases.\n\n\"Dust,\" Mr. Tucker said. \"Dust ... dust ... more dust. Soon the dust\nwill be over everything. When the wind is gone, it will be there to hold\nour footprints.\"\n\nInside the air-conditioned scout, the men shivered.\n\n\"How did you come to find them?\" Mr. Ryan asked.\n\n\"I saw the constructions from the photos, sir. This had been missed by\nthe mapping party. It's easy enough to see why when you see the\npictures.\"\n\n\"This the only one?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"How can you be sure of that, Captain Meford? It's a large planet.\"\n\n\"I had one of the machines scan the remaining maps for geometrical\npatterns, sir.\"\n\n\"Isn't that done routinely?\" Mr. Tucker asked rather sharply.\n\n\"Yes, sir. But you see, we've always expected that if we were ever going\nto encounter intelligent life on a planet, it would be rather\nwidespread. Accordingly--and this is the routine procedure, sir, used,\nas far as I know, by all contact parties--we ran through a statistically\nsignificant sample of the terrain. There was nothing on Miracastle out\nof the ordinary. There was the typical, low-order vegetable matter,\nabout what we always find. It was a very typical planet, sir.\"\n\nThe third man from the Earth Committee, Mr. Wallace, seldom spoke. When\nhe did, his voice was mild, and there was a sense of child-like wonder\nin his tone. \"The natives?\" he asked.\n\n\"They ... had fled when we discovered the city.\"\n\n\"Where did they flee to?\" Mr. Wallace asked.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCaptain Meford glanced upward. Other eyes followed to end just below the\nedge of the view screen. Above stood the sheer face of the cliff. Clouds\nroiled below the summit, obscuring it from view.\n\n\"There is a long sloping plateau up there, and a series of natural caves\nback in the next cliff face,\" Captain Meford said. This did not seem\nadequate. He continued: \"Most of the air-changing activity starts in the\nlow-lying areas, at first around the dome positions. It advances along\nan elevation front, gradually drifting up. Little tongues are carried up\nin advance by the heated currents. The aliens retreated before it. On\nthe plateau you can see the sentries. I guess they posted themselves\nthere, at intervals, between the edge and the new caves, to define the\nlimits of safety. They died there. Six of them. The rest, several\nhundred, reached the caves. They are dead, too.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Mr. Wallace said.\n\n\"When you first discovered them--?\" Mr. Ryan asked after a moment.\n\nCaptain Meford hesitated.\n\nMr. Tucker said: \"I believe one of your men killed himself last\nnight--wasn't it? A technician? I was told he felt you could reverse the\nair-changing equipment in time to save the aliens. I understand that was\nvery much on his mind for the last week or so.\"\n\n\"I'm not too familiar with the man, sir. He was on Captain Arnold's\nshift, I believe.\"\n\n\"Captain Meford,\" Mr. Ryan insisted, \"when did you say you first\ndiscovered the aliens?\"\n\nCaptain Meford hesitated. The others waited.\n\n\"They were then scaling the cliff, sir.\"\n\n\"And General Shorter, was he told of this immediately?\" Mr. Ryan asked.\n\n\"I don't know when the general was told.\"\n\n\"You discovered them?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. I ... you see, at the time the winds completely prohibited\nair traffic. As you know, the air scouts are not stable enough until ...\nlater. Later, I ... Yes, sir. I discovered them.\"\n\n\"Did you then inform the general?\"\n\n\"No, sir. I informed the duty officer.\"\n\n\"Did he inform the general?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you tell the general?\" Mr. Tucker asked.\n\n\"I was then in communication with Captain Geiger, and I felt he....\" The\nsentence trailed away.\n\n\"Would tell the general?\" Mr. Tucker prompted. \"Well, did he?\"\n\n\"I believe he did, sir,\" Captain Meford said. He let out a long breath.\n\n\"May we see the aliens?\" Mr. Ryan asked.\n\n\"I wouldn't advise it, sir,\" Captain Meford said. \"High flights are\nstill very risky because of the wind velocities.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter the evening meal, General Shorter called Captain Arnold aside.\n\"Mind if I go over to Nine with you?\" he asked. \"The air around here\nis--well, the fact of the matter is, I'd like to get away from them for\nawhile.\"\n\n\"Of course not, sir,\" Captain Arnold said.\n\n\"We'll call it an inspection. Which might be a good idea at that. With\nthese people running around trying to interfere with my schedule. Poking\naround. Asking questions. Taking men away from their work, basically.\"\nHe tapped his teeth with his right thumb in reflection. \"I'd better\ncheck up on all the domes tonight, just to be sure.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't want anything to go wrong because they're here.\"\n\nIn the dressing quarters, they donned surface suits and exited through\nthe locks to Miracastle. In the area immediately beyond the Dome, the\nsolidly positioned connection rails radiated away. The general gestured\nfor the captain to lead.\n\nThe wind buffeted them. Inside the surface suits it was quiet.\n\n\"David?\" the general asked.\n\n\"Yes, sir?\" Captain Arnold said. He was fastening his safety line in the\nkeyed slot. He fumbled with it for a moment before the wind.\n\n\"You on suit communications?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" Captain Arnold straightened and moved forward. The general\nreplaced him and dropped his safety line in place with practiced\nefficiency.\n\nCaptain Arnold, surrounded by dust devils, became a distant, indistinct\nbulk. His motions were ponderous. The general could no longer see his\nface or his expression.\n\n\"I do not entirely understand this, David,\" the general said\nconversationally. \"The investigation. I thought I had powerful friends\nin the Corps. Though a man makes enemies.\" The general lurched awkwardly\nover the broken surface of Miracastle, drawing the safety line taut. He\nmoved toward the connection rail again. \"A general is separated from\nmuch of his command. Some of the technical refinements are too\ninvolved--and, of course, men hide their feelings.\" Once again he\nstruggled with the wind, turning slowly at the end of the safety line:\nheld from the devouring anger of the planet only by the slender\numbilical cord from the stars. \"General Grisley, now. I think he's\nsixteen star, in headquarters. He was a politician. He came up fast. In\nfact, he was my adjutant a few years ago. He was always a man to hold a\ngrudge.\"\n\nCaptain Arnold made no reply.\n\n\"You know how politics is in the Corps.\"\n\nDome Nine rose from the swirling mist before them. The wind seemed to\nincrease in fury. And still, inside the suits, there was the sound only\nof labored breathing and the general's voice.\n\n\"These natives,\" the general said. \"They were very primitive, David.\"\nNeither could see the other's face. \"I can't think of them as\nintelligent at all. I feel they were very low on the evolutionary\nladder. I wouldn't call it a city, as I've heard it called. Natural\nformation, more likely. Nature plays strange tricks.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were at the lock of Dome Nine.\n\nInside, the general removed his helmet. \"David,\" he said, \"I've been\nmeaning to talk to you for some time now. You've got a good career in\nfront of you in the Corps. You're going to move up. With a few breaks,\nright to the top. I'm just now writing up my evaluation for your files.\nI plan to give you a very fine recommendation, Captain. Normally, I\ndon't talk about this sort of thing, but I thought you might like to\nknow.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" Captain Arnold said uneasily, opening his surface\nsuit.\n\n\"Well, let's inspect the area, Captain.\"\n\nThe inspection was perfunctory. As he always did, the general paused at\nthe pile monitor and watched, in the Dante screen, the virtually\nindescribable reactions being sustained far beneath the surface: molten\nrock flowing and smoking. Orange, blue and white flames danced as though\nin agony in the great, expanding cavern, danced and merged and vanished\nand reappeared in an ever-changing pattern.\n\nBack at the locks, the general bid Captain Arnold good-by and turned to\nleave. Then, as if an afterthought came forward, he turned back.\n\n\"David, oh, David!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you remember a conversation we had a few weeks ago? I called on\nyou for some technical advice.\" He held his helmet in his hands.\n\n\"When was that, sir?\"\n\n\"Oh, it was about the technical feasibility of reversing the\nair-changing equipment, I believe. As you know, I can't be up on all the\ntechnical, purely detailed procedure, for all phases of the operation.\nThat's what we have experts for.\" The last statement was unusually\njovial. \"I believe you told me, David, that the process was too far\nalong at that time. Perhaps you remember?\"\n\n\"General Shorter, when was that?\"\n\n\"I thought you would remember, David. I'm sure it was you. Yes, I'm\nalmost positive it was. But if you say.... Well, David, it wasn't quite\nso much as exactly a statement like that. But that was the general\nmeaning of it, you know, stripped of all the technical language. You\nhave to take it in the over-all context. That was the meaning I got.\" He\nlaughed tactfully. \"You're like lawyers, all you technicians. You answer\neverything yes and no at the same time. I hoped you'd remember the\nconversation. I got that idea from it.\" The general waited. \"Well,\nDavid--don't look like that--it's not at all important. Just trying to\nrefresh my own memory. It's not important, really.... Good night,\nDavid.\" He placed the helmet over his head.\n\n\"Good night, General.\"\n\nMethodically the general completed his rounds. He laughed often and\njoked with the men and seemed in exceptionally good spirits.\n\nBack in his own quarters, he brought out his diary. With a weary sigh,\nhe sat down to it. He glanced at his timepiece. The day extended\nbackward almost beyond memory but it was not yet late.\n\nAfter thumbing the diary listlessly for several minutes--pausing now and\nthen at a paragraph--he began to write. He put the events of the day\ndown precisely in their logical sequence.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nThe Committee took over the dining area when the general left for his\ntour of inspection. While the steward's department was preparing coffee\nfor the interviewees, now assembling in the corridor, the four members\nof the Committee arranged themselves at the larger of the tables.\nNotepaper lay before them.\n\nMr. Tucker lighted a cigar and fingered it. \"A rather good meal,\" he\nsaid.\n\nThe others nodded.\n\n\"I may as well start off, while we're waiting,\" Mr. Wallace said. \"I'll\nsummarize my somewhat contradictory observations.\n\n\"Superficially, the cultural level of the natives appeared quite\nprimitive. The absence of tools would normally be indicative. On the\nother hand, the city was carved from rock in a way so as to suggest a\nvery sophisticated technology. And writing, while apparently not\npracticed to any considerable extent, was known--or, if not writing as\nwe understand it, some advanced decorative technique. We've found two\nlines of it, at least.\n\n\"Again superficially, the city would suggest a nomadic tradition, but\nfor its craftsmanship. It seems independent of any obvious supply of\nfood and their equivalent of water, if any. Nor were any provisions in\nevidence for the disposal of waste products. Yet the city had the\nappearance of age and continual usage. If you notice, the floor of the\nrecess was worn unevenly toward the center by what I should guess to be\nthe traffic of several centuries.\n\n\"The thought naturally occurs that the aliens were the rather decadent\nrelics of a highly developed technological civilization existing on the\nplanet in the not too distant past. Yet Miracastle offers no evidence\nfor the existence of a prior technology--no ruins, no residual\nradioactivity from atomic operations. In short, the city has no apparent\ngenesis in the past.\n\n\"The alternative arises: perhaps the natives were not natives at all,\nbut immigrants or colonists like ourselves. Yet the age of the city\ncontradicts this.\n\n\"Perhaps there is a simple explanation, although it does not occur to\nme. But I do have this feeling. The city was utilitarian. To me, it\ncalls to mind one of those exquisite etchings of Picasso. The severe\neconomy of line suggests simplicity. Yet, on further inspection, you see\nthat each line contributes to a rather bewildering variety of\nperspectives. I strongly suspect that the city and the people of\nMiracastle will remain one of the great, unsolved mysteries of the\nuniverse.\"\n\nMr. Wallace was finished with his remarks.\n\nMr. Ryan nodded. \"Perhaps I'm deficient in sensibilities, but I find\nthat the most ... agonizing ... thing of all is not ever to be able to\nknow what these people were like. It's almost as if some part of us had\nbeen lopped off, isn't it? What did the people of Miracastle think\nabout? What was their philosophy of life? What was their social\norganization? What was their ultimate goals? When you realize how much\nwe learned of ourselves from an examination of our own primitive\ncultures, the sense of loss really comes home. Think how much more we\ncould have learned of ourselves by acquiring the perspective of a truly\nalien culture. It's almost as if we could really understand ourselves at\nlast if we could only understand a totally alien culture ...\"\n\n\"Well, that's gone,\" Mr. Tucker said. The words were brittle and\ndiscrete. They hung in memory and the listeners waited as though for an\necho of something shouted into a canyon. The echo did not come.\n\nThey were silent. Grief is the final knowledge of time. When one first\nlearns that it can never be turned backward upon itself to permit the\ncorrection of past sins and the rightings of wrongs transfixed and\nforever unalterable. Grief is the frantic, futile beating of hands\nagainst a barrier without substance, both obscenely unreal and yet the\nonly reality. Grief is the knowledge that we cannot step backwards\nbefore the death of loved ones and see those precious half-forgotten\ndream faces once again. Grief is the knowledge that time is immutable.\n\nOutside the Richardson Dome, the wind was changing. It could now neither\nsupport the life that was nor the life that would be, and it howled in\nmelancholy and insensate anguish its loneliness and longing to the\neternal and ever-changing pattern of the stars.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Committee concluded their interviews with an old-line corporal. He\nhad just short of thirty years service and had several times traveled\nthe two-way escalator of non-commissioned rank from master sergeant to\nprivate. He was perhaps typical of many of the older soldiers. His love\nof the Corps was expressed by his loyalty to it; his hatred of the Corps\nwas expressed by his inability to abide by its regulations.\n\n\"You knew Sergeant Schuster very well?\" Mr. Tucker asked.\n\n\"He was a new man,\" the corporal said. \"He got on just before lift-off.\nA week, two weeks, something like that. I knew him, I guess. He was one\nof them kind that was always thinking. And like you know, sir, thinking\nain't too good for a soldier. I've known a lot of guys like that in my\ntime. You know what I mean? They're not cut out for the Corps.\"\n\n\"He talked to you quite a bit?\"\n\nThe corporal turned to face Mr. Ryan. \"He was always talking, sir. He\nwas a regular nut. I thought for a while he was queer. He had all those\ncrazy ideas.\"\n\n\"Like what, Corporal?\"\n\n\"Oh, like--well, you know.\" The corporal hesitated and rummaged his\nmemory without conspicuous success. \"Sunsets,\" he said rather\nemphatically. \"Talked about sunsets. Talked about just _anything_.\nCalled me out back on Earth to look at a sunset once, I remember.\"\n\n\"What did he think about killing the natives?\" Mr. Wallace asked.\n\nThe question alerted the mechanism which produced the almost-Pavlovian\nloyalty response.\n\n\"We didn't kill no natives,\" the corporal said. \"They just died when we\nchanged the air. Tough.\"\n\nHe looked at Mr. Wallace and then into the silence around him.\n\n\"Well ... well, let's see. I guess you'd say that sort of got to him. I\nmean, you know, he thought it was--\" the voice became distant, as though\ndescribing a fantastic event which he could not relate to anything in a\nrational environment--\"he thought it was _his_ fault. You know how some\nof these guys are. I used to have a platoon once, you know. And they\nsay--\" He twisted his mouth and changed his voice to a childish whine.\n\"What _for_?\" The voice reverted to normal. \"They don't ask for any\nreason. They just ask. I say to them, I say, 'God damn it'--excuse me,\nsir--'I told you to do it, ain't that enough?' Well, this Schuster, sir,\nhe worried all the time. He got so he cut himself shaving. Damnedest\nthing. Oh, hell, maybe for the last week, every morning, he came out a\nbloody mess. Patches of toilet paper all over his face. 'I can't shave,'\nhe'd say. 'My God, I can't shave.' He wasn't nervous, either. His hands\nwere okay. They didn't shake. It's just that he couldn't shave. Like I\nsay, he was a nut.\"\n\nNo one spoke for a moment, and the corporal twisted uncomfortably.\n\nThen Mr. Tucker said, \"Well, Corporal, tell me this, please.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"What's your own personal impression of General Shorter?\"\n\n\"The old man?\" the corporal asked in surprise. \"He's okay.\"\n\n\"Feel free to discuss this,\" Mr. Flison said. \"We'd like to know,\nreally, what your opinion is.\"\n\n\"Like I say, he's okay. He's got a job to do. You know, he busted me\nonce. General Shorter personally, I mean. Hell, I don't hold it against\nhim, though. He's got his job to do, I got mine. I wouldn't say anything\nagainst General Shorter, no, sir. He's a soldier. I mean, you know ...\nhe's a soldier.\"\n\nAfter the corporal was dismissed, Mr. Tucker said, \"Well, gentlemen, I\nguess we've about wrapped it up here. I think this is enough. Anybody's\nmind changed? I don't think we need any more, do you?\"\n\nMr. Wallace sighed heavily. He looked down at his hands.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGeneral Shorter was still at his writing desk when he was notified that\nMr. Tucker would like to see him first thing in the morning.\n\n\"Another day of it, eh?\" the general asked the sergeant who brought the\nmessage.\n\n\"No, sir. From the other crew, I hear they're planning to leave\ntomorrow.\"\n\nThe general's face relaxed. His smile reflected weary tolerance. \"Had\nenough in one day, have they? It's about time they let us get back to\nwork.\"\n\nAfter the sergeant left, the general wrote a final paragraph:\n\n\"I've just been informed the 'investigation' is completed. In record\ntime, it seems. They finished up in the mess tonight, talking to some of\nthe men. So what did it all really accomplish? They took a long ship\nthat could better have been used somewhere else. Half my men are down\nwith the virus. They almost cost me my schedule. And to what end? Just\nanother piece of paper somewhere. Put Miracastle on the scale against\nsome nice, heavy report and see which way the scale tips.\"\n\nThe general closed the diary. It was late now. He was very tired.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMr. Tucker, after breakfast, knocked on the general's door.\n\n\"Come in,\" General Shorter called.\n\nThe civilian entered. The general dismissed the orderly with a nod. \"And\nI'll need some clean towels for tonight,\" he called. His voice was\nhoarse.\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nThe door closed. The two of them were alone.\n\n\"Sit down. Excuse the cold. Got it last night. What do you say to a\nbrandy?\"\n\n\"Don't let me stop you.\"\n\n\"I never drink alone.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you'd better,\" Mr. Tucker said.\n\nThe general had paused just short of the cupboard. He turned slowly. \"In\nthat case, I'll make an exception, this once.\" He poured. \"Just what did\nyou mean by that, sir? Let's get to the point.\"\n\n\"General Shorter, we're going to have to ask you to come back with us.\"\n\nThe general bent slightly forward. His lips were partly open, as though\nhe were listening to hear a second time.\n\n\"Why,\" he said, \"I've too much work to do, sir. I'm afraid that's out of\nthe question. It's just not possible at all.\"\n\nMr. Tucker waited.\n\nGeneral Shorter poured himself another brandy. His back was to the\ncivilian.\n\n\"There's nothing more important, right now, than my job here,\" he said.\nHe drank the brandy in a single gulp.\n\n\"I don't see how it can wait, General,\" Mr. Tucker said.\n\nThe general's lips were dry. He closed his eyes tightly for a moment\nagainst the alcohol and the cold. He licked his lips. \"What's the formal\ncharge?\"\n\nMr. Tucker bent forward. His voice was soft and curious, as though the\nquestion were his final effort to understand something that puzzled him\nfor a long time. \"What do you think it is, General?\"\n\n\"What could it be?\" the general said sharply. \"I follow orders, sir. I\nwas sent out here to make this planet suitable for human habitation.\nThis is exactly what I have been doing.\" His voice was growing\nprogressively more angry and with an effort he curbed himself. \"Put\nyourself in my position. I did what any field commander would have done.\nIt was too late to stop it. I've got--It's a question of the limits of\nnormal prudence. A matter of interpretation, sir.\"\n\nThe general was in the process of pouring still another drink. The\nslender brandy glass broke under the force of his anger. He opened his\npalm. Blood trickled from between his fingers.\n\nThe general looked up from the hand and fleeting annoyance came and went\nbefore he was recalled to present reality. His eyes met Mr. Tucker's.\n\nMr. Tucker suddenly shivered as if touched by a wind from beyond the\nmost distant stars, a wind which whispered: The aliens are among us.\n\n\"General,\" Mr. Tucker said, \"the formal charge is murder.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's General Max Shorter, by Kris Ottman Neville\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK GENERAL MAX SHORTER ***\n\n***** This file should be named 23571.txt or 23571.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/3/5/7/23571/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
