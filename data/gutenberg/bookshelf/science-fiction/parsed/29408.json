Bert Redmond had never heard of the place until he received\nJoan's letter. But here it was, a tiny straggling village cuddled\namongst the Ramapo hills of lower New York State, only a few miles\nfrom Tuxedo. There was a prim, white-painted church, a general store\nwith the inevitable gasoline pump at the curb, and a dozen or so of\nweatherbeaten frame houses. That was all. It was a typical, dusty\ncross-roads hamlet of the vintage of thirty years before, utterly\nisolated and apart from the rushing life of the broad concrete highway\nso short a distance away.\n\nBert stopped his ancient and battered flivver at the corner where a\ngroup of overalled loungers was gathered. Its asthmatic motor died\nwith a despairing cough as he cut the ignition.\n\n\"Anyone tell me where to find the Carmody place?\" he sang out.\n\nNo one answered, and for a moment there was no movement amongst his\nlisteners. Then one of the loungers, an old man with a stubble of gray\nbeard, drew near and regarded him through thick spectacles.\n\n\"You ain't aimin' to go up there alone, be you?\" the old fellow asked\nin a thin cracked voice.\n\n\"Certainly. Why?\" Bert caught a peculiar gleam in the watery old eyes\nthat were enlarged so enormously by the thick lenses. It was fear of\nthe supernatural that lurked there, stark terror, almost.\n\n\"Don't you go up to the Carmody place, young feller. They's queer\ndoin's in the big house, is why. Blue lights at night, an' noises\ninside--an'--an' cracklin' like thunder overhead--\"\n\n\"Aw shet up, Gramp!\" Another of the idlers, a youngster with chubby\nfeatures, and downy of lip and chin, sauntered over from the group,\ninterrupting the old man's discourse. \"Don't listen to him,\" he said\nto Bert. \"He's cracked a mite--been seein' things. The big house is up\nyonder on the hill. See, with the red chimbley showin' through the\ntrees. They's a windin' road down here a piece.\"\n\nBert followed the pointing finger with suddenly anxious gaze. It was\nnot an inviting spot, that tangle of second-growth timber and\nunderbrush that hid the big house on the lonely hillside; it might\nconceal almost anything. And Joan Parker was there!\n\nThe one called Gramp was screeching invectives at the grinning\nbystanders. \"You passel o' young idjits!\" he stormed. \"I seen it, I\ntell you. An'--an' heard things, too, The devil hisself is up\nthere--an' his imps. We'd oughtn't to let this feller go....\"\n\n[Illustration: _He attacked it in vain with his fists._]\n\nBert waited to hear no more. Unreasoning fear came to him that\nsomething was very much amiss up there at the big house, and he\nstarted the flivver with a thunderous barrage of its exhaust.\n\nThe words of Joan's note were vivid in his mind: \"Come to me, Bert, at\nthe Carmody place in Lenville. Believe me, I need you.\" Only that, but\nit had been sufficient to bring young Redmond across three states to\nthis measly town that wasn't even on the road maps.\n\nBert yanked the bouncing car into the winding road that led up the\nhill, and thought grimly of the quarrel with Joan two years before. He\nhad told her then, arrogantly, that she'd need him some day. But now\nthat his words had proved true the fact brought him no consolation\nnor the slightest elation. Joan was there in this lonely spot, and she\ndid need him. That was enough.\n\nHe ran nervous fingers through his already tousled mop of sandy\nhair--a habit he had when disturbed--and nearly wrecked the car on a\ngray boulder that encroached on one of the two ruts which, together,\nhad been termed a road.\n\nStupid, that quarrel of theirs. And how stubborn both had been! Joan\nhad insisted on going to the big city to follow the career her\nbrother had chosen for her. Chemistry, biology, laboratory work! Bert\nsniffed, even now. But he had been equally stubborn in his insistence\nthat she marry him instead and settle down on the middle-Western fruit\nfarm.\n\nWith a sudden twist, the road turned in at the entrance of a sadly\nneglected estate. The grounds of the place were overrun with rank\ngrowths and the driveway was covered with weeds. The tumble-down\ngables of a descrepit frame house peeped out through the trees. It was\na rambling old building that once had been a mansion--the \"big house\"\nof the natives. A musty air of decay was upon it, and crazily askew\nwindow shutters proclaimed deep-shrouded mystery within.\n\nBert drew up at the rickety porch and stopped the flivver with its\nusual shuddering jerk.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs if his coming had been watched for through the stained glass of its\nwindows, the door was flung violently open. A white-clad figure darted\nacross the porch, but not before Bert had untangled the lean six feet\nof him from under the flivver's wheel and bounded up the steps.\n\n\"Joan!\"\n\n\"Bert! I--I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Me too.\" Swallowing hard, Bert Redmond held her close.\n\n\"But I won't go back to Indiana!\" The girl raised her chin and the old\ndefiance was in her tearful gaze.\n\nBert stared. Joan was white and wan, a mere shadow of her old self.\nAnd she was trembling, hysterical.\n\n\"That's all right,\" he whispered. \"But tell me now, what is it? What's\nwrong?\"\n\nWith sudden vigor she was drawing him into the house. \"It's Tom,\" she\nquavered. \"I can't do a thing with him; can't get him to leave here.\nAnd something terrible is about to happen, I know. I thought perhaps\nyou could help, even if--\"\n\n\"Tom Parker here?\" Bert was surprised that the fastidious older\nbrother should leave his comfortable city quarters and lose himself in\nthis God-forsaken place. \"Sure, I'll help, dear--if I can.\"\n\n\"You can; oh, I'm sure you can,\" the girl went on tremulously. A spot\nof color flared in either cheek. \"It's his experiments. He came over\nfrom New York about a year ago and rented this old house. The city\nlaboratory wasn't secluded enough. And I've helped him until now in\neverything. But I'm frightened; he's playing with dangerous forces. He\ndoesn't understand--won't understand. But I saw....\"\n\nAnd then Joan Parker slumped into a high-backed chair that stood in\nthe ancient paneled hall. Soft waves of her chestnut hair framed the\npinched, terrified face, and wide eyes looked up at Bert, with the\nsame horror he had seen in those of the old fellow the village. A\nsurge of the old tenderness welled up in him and he wanted to take her\nin his arms.\n\n\"Wait,\" she said, swiftly rising. \"I'll let you judge for yourself.\nHere--go into the laboratory and talk with Tom.\"\n\nShe pushed him forward and through a door that closed softly behind\nhim. He was in a large room that was cluttered with the most\nbewildering array of electrical mechanisms he had ever seen. Joan had\nremained outside.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTom Parker, his hair grayer and forehead higher than when Bert had\nseen him last, rose from where he was stooping over a work bench. He\nadvanced, smiling, and his black eyes were alight with genuine\npleasure. Bert had anticipated a less cordial welcome.\n\n\"Albert Redmond!\" exclaimed the older man. \"This is a surprise. Glad\nto see you, boy, glad to see you.\"\n\nHe meant it, Tom did, and Bert wrung the extended hand heartily. Yet\nhe dared not tell of Joan's note. The two men had always been the very\nbest of friends--except in the matter of Joan's future.\n\n\"You haven't changed much,\" Bert ventured.\n\nTom Parker laughed. \"Not about Joan, if that is what you mean. She\nlikes the work and will go far in it. Why, Bert--\"\n\n\"Sa-ay, wait a minute.\" Bert Redmond's mien was solemn. \"I saw her\noutside, Tom, and was shocked. She isn't herself--doesn't look at all\nwell. Haven't you noticed, man?\"\n\nThe older man sobered and a puzzled frown crossed his brow. \"I have\nnoticed, yes. But it's nonsense, Bert, I swear it is. She has been\nhaving dreams--worrying a lot, it seems. Guess I'll have to send her\nto the doctor?\"\n\n\"Dreams? Worry?\" Bert thought of the old man called Gramp.\n\n\"Yes. I'll tell you all about it--what we're working on here--and show\nyou. It's no wonder she gets that way, I guess. I've been a bit loony\nwith the marvel of it myself at times. Come here.\"\n\nTom led him to an intricate apparatus which bore some resemblance to a\ntelevision radio. There were countless vacuum tubes and their\ncontrols, tiny motors belted to slotted disks that would spin when\npower was applied, and a double eyepiece.\n\n\"Before I let you look,\" Tom was saying, \"I'll give you an idea of it,\nto prepare you. This is a mechanism I've developed for a study of the\nless-understood dimensions. The results have more than justified my\nexpectations--they're astounding. Bert, we can actually see into these\nrealms that were hitherto unexplored. We can examine at close range\nthe life of these other planes. Think of it!\"\n\n\"Life--plane--dimensions?\" said Bert blankly. \"Remember, I know very\nlittle about this science of yours.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Haven't you read the news-paper accounts of Einstein's researches and\nof others who have delved into the theory of relativity?\"\n\n\"Sa-ay! I read them, but they don't tell me a thing. It's over my head\na mile.\"\n\n\"Well, listen: this universe of ours--space and all it contains--is a\nthing of five dimensions, a continuum we have never begun to\ncontemplate in its true complexity and immensity. There are three of\nits dimensions with which we are familiar. Our normal senses perceive\nand understand them--length, breadth and thickness. The fourth\ndimension, time, or, more properly, the time-space interval, we have\nonly recently understood. And this fifth dimension, Bert, is something\nno man on earth has delved into--excepting myself.\"\n\n\"You don't say.\" Bert was properly impressed; the old gleam of the\nenthusiastic scientist was in Tom's keen eyes.\n\n\"Surest thing. I have called this fifth dimension the interval of\noscillation, though the term is not precisely correct. It has to do\nwith the arrangement, the speed and direction of movement, and the\npolarity of protonic and electronic energy charges of which matter is\ncomprised. It upsets some of our old and accepted natural laws--one in\nparticular. Bert, two objects can occupy the same space at the same\ntime, though only one is perceptible to our earthbound senses. Their\ndifferently constituted atoms exist in the same location without\ninterference--merely vibrating in different planes. There are many\nsuch planes in this fifth dimension of space, all around us, some\nactually inhabited. Each plane has a different atomic structure of\nmatter, its own oscillation interval of the energy that is matter, and\na set of natural laws peculiar to itself. I can't begin to tell you;\nin fact, I've explored only a fraction. But here--look!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTom's instrument set up a soft purring at his touch of a lever, and\neery blue light flickered from behind the double eyepiece, casting\ngrotesque shadows on walls and ceiling, and paling to insignificance\nthe light of day that filtered through the long-unwashed windows.\n\nBert squinted through the hooded twin lenses. At first he was dazzled\nand confused by the rapidly whirling light-images, but these quickly\nresolved into geometric figures, an inconceivable number of them,\nextending off into limitless space in a huge arc, revolving and\ntumbling like the colored particles in an old-fashioned kaleidoscope.\nCubes, pyramids and cones of variegated hues. Swift-rushing spheres\nand long slim cylinders of brilliant blue-white; gleaming disks of\npolished jet, spinning....\n\nAbruptly the view stabilized, and clear-cut stationary objects sprang\ninto being. An unbroken vista of seamed chalky cliffs beside an inky\nsea whose waters rose and fell rhythmically yet did not break against\nthe towering palisade. Wave-less, glass-smooth, these waters. A huge\nblood-red sun hanging low in a leaden though cloudless sky, reflecting\nscintillating flecks of gold and purple brilliance from the ocean's\nblack surface.\n\nAt first there was no sign of life to be seen. Then a mound was rising\nup from the sea near the cliff, a huge tortoiselike shape that\nstretched forth several flat members which adhered to the vertical\nwhite wall is if held by suction disks. Ponderously the thing turned\nover and headed up from the inky depths, spewing out from its concave\nunder side an army of furry brown bipeds. Creatures with bloated\ntorsos in which head and body merged so closely as to be\nindistinguishable one from the other, balanced precariously on two\nspindly legs, and with long thin arms like tentacles, waving and\ncoiling. Spiderlike beings ran out over the smooth dark surface of the\nsea as if it were solid ground.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Jupiter!\" Bert looked up from the eyepiece, blinking into the\ntriumphant grinning face of Tom Parker. \"You mean to tell me these\ncreatures are real?\" he demanded. \"Living here, all around us, in\nanother plane where we can't see them without this machine of yours?\"\n\n\"Surest thing. And this is but one of many such planes.\"\n\n\"They can't get through, to our plane?\"\n\n\"Lord no, man, how could they?\"\n\nA sharp crackling peal of thunder rang out overhead and Tom Parker\nwent suddenly white. Outside, the sky was cloudless.\n\n\"And that--what's that?\" Bert remembered the warning of the old man of\nthe village, and Joan's obvious fear.\n\n\"It--it's only a physical manifestation of the forces I use in\nobtaining visual connection, one of the things that worries Joan. Yet\nI can't find any cause for alarm....\"\n\nThe scientist's voice droned on endlessly, technically. But Bert knew\nthere was something Tom did not understand, something he was trying\ndesperately to explain to himself.\n\nThunder rumbled once more, and Bert returned his eyes to the\ninstrument. Directly before him in the field of vision a group of the\nspider men advanced over the pitchy sea with a curiously constructed\ncage of woven transparent material which they set down at a point so\nclose by that it seemed he could touch it if he stretched out his\nhand. The illusion of physical nearness was perfect. The evil eyes of\nthe creatures were fastened upon him; tentacle arms uncoiled and\nreached forth as if to break down the barrier that separated them.\n\nAnd then a scream penetrated his consciousness, wrenching him back to\nconsideration of his immediate surroundings. The laboratory door burst\nopen and Joan, pale and disheveled, dashed into the room.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTom shouted, running forward to intercept her, and Bert saw what he\nhad not seen before, a ten-foot circle of blue-white metal set in the\nfloor and illuminated by a shaft of light from a reflector on the\nceiling above Tom's machine.\n\n\"Joan--the force area!\" Tom was yelling. \"Keep away!\"\n\nTom had reached the distraught girl and was struggling with her over\non the far side of the disk.\n\nThere came a throbbing of the very air surrounding them, and Bert saw\nTom and Joan on the other side of the force area, their white faces\nindistinct and wavering as if blurred by heat waves rising between.\nThe rumblings and cracklings overhead increased in intensity until the\nold house swayed and creaked with the concussions. Hazy forms\nmaterialized on the lighted disk--the cage of the transparent, woven\nbasket--dark spidery forms within. The creatures from that other\nplane!\n\n\"Joan! Tom!\" Bert's voice was soundless as he tried to shout, and his\nmuscles were paralyzed when he attempted to hurl himself across to\nthem. The blue-white light had spread and formed a huge bubble of\nwhite brilliance, a transparent elastic solid that flung him back when\nhe attacked it in vain with his fists.\n\nWithin its confines he saw Joan and her brother scuffling with the\nspider men, tearing at the tentacle arms that encircled them and drew\nthem relentlessly into the basket-weave cage. There was a tremendous\nthump and the warping of the very universe about them all. Bert\nRedmond, his body racked by insupportable tortures, was hurled into\nthe black abyss of infinity....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis was not death nor was it a dream from which he would awaken.\nAfter that moment of mental agony and ghastly physical pain, after a\ndizzying rush through inky nothingness, Bert knew suddenly that he was\nvery much alive. If he had lost consciousness at all, it had been for\nno great length of time. And yet there was this sense of strangeness\nin his surroundings, a feeling that he had been transported over some\nnameless gulf of space. He had dropped to his knees, but with the\nswift return of normal faculties he jumped to his feet.\n\nA tall stranger confronted him, a half-nude giant with bronzed skin\nand of solemn visage. The stalwart build of him and the smooth\ncontours of cheek and jaw proclaimed him a man not yet past middle\nage, but his uncropped hair was white as the driven snow.\n\nThey stood in a spherical chamber of silvery metal, Bert and this\ngiant, and the gentle vibration of delicately balanced machinery made\nitself felt in the structure. Of Joan and Tom there was no sign.\n\n\"Where am I?\" Bert demanded. \"And where are my friends? Why am I with\nyou, without them?\"\n\nCompassion was in the tall stranger's gaze--and something more. The\npain of a great sorrow filled the brown eyes that looked down at Bert,\nand resignation to a fate that was shrouded in ineffable mystery.\n\n\"Trust me,\" he said in a mellow slurring voice. \"Where you are, you\nshall soon learn. You are safe. And your friends will be located.\"\n\n\"_Will_ be located! Don't you _know_ where they are?\" Bert laid hands\non the big man's wrists and shook him impatiently. The stranger was\ntoo calm and unmoved in the face of this tremendous thing which had\ncome to pass.\n\n\"I know where they have been taken, yes. But there is no need of haste\nout here in infra-dimensional space, for time stands still. We will\nfind it a simple matter to reach the plane of their captors, the\nBardeks, within a few seconds after your friends arrive there. My\nplane segregator--this sphere--will accomplish this in due season.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStrangely, Bert believed him. This talk of dimensions and planes and\nof the halting of time was incomprehensible, but somehow there was\ncommunicated to his own restless nature something of the placid\nserenity of the white-haired stranger. He regarded the man more\nclosely, saw there was an alien look about him that marked him as\ndifferent and apart from the men of Earth. His sole garment was a wide\nbreech clout of silvery stuff that glinted with changing colors--hues\nforeign to nature on Earth. His was a superhuman perfection of\nmuscular development, and there was an indescribable mingling of\ngentleness and sternness in his demeanor. With a start, Bert noted\nthat his fingers were webbed, as were his toes.\n\n\"Sa-ay,\" Bert exclaimed, \"who are you, anyway?\"\n\nThe stranger permitted himself the merest ghost of a smile. \"You may\ncall me Wanderer,\" he said. \"I am the Wanderer of Infinity.\"\n\n\"Infinity! You are not of my world?\"\n\n\"But no.\"\n\n\"You speak my language.\"\n\n\"It is one of many with which I am familiar.\"\n\n\"I--I don't understand.\" Bert Redmond was like a man in a trance,\ncompletely under the spell of his amazing host's personality.\n\n\"It is given to few men, to understand.\" The Wanderer fell silent, his\narms folded across his broad chest. And his great shoulders bowed as\nunder the weight of centuries of mankind's cares. \"Yet I would have\nyou understand, O Man-Called-Bert, for the tale is a strange one and\nis heavy upon me.\"\n\nIt was uncanny that this Wanderer should address him by name. Bert\nthrilled to a new sense of awe.\n\n\"But,\" he objected, \"my friends are in the hands of the spider men.\nYou said we'd go to them. Good Lord, man, I've got to do it!\"\n\n\"You forget that time means nothing here. We will go to them in\nprecise synchronism with the proper time as existent in that plane.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Wanderer's intense gaze held Bert speechless, hypnotized. A swift\ndimming of the sphere's diffused illumination came immediately, and\ndarkness swept down like a blanket, thick and stifling. This was no\nordinary darkness, but utter absence of light--the total obscurity of\nErebus. And the hidden motors throbbed with sudden new vigor.\n\n\"Behold!\" At the Wanderer's exclamation the enclosing sphere became\ntransparent and they were in the midst of a dizzying maelstrom of\nflashing color. Brilliant geometric shapes, there were, whirling off\ninto the vastness of space; as Bert had seen them in Tom Parker's\ninstrument. A gigantic arc of rushing light-forms spanning the black\ngulf of an unknown cosmos. And in the foreground directly under the\nsphere was a blue-white disk, horizontally fixed--a substantial and\nfamiliar object, with hazy surroundings likewise familiar.\n\n\"Isn't that the metal platform in my friend's laboratory?\" asked Bert,\nmarveling.\n\n\"It is indeed.\" The mellow voice of the Wanderer was grave, and he\nlaid a hand on Bert's arm. \"And for so long as it exists it\nconstitutes a serious menace to your civilization. It is a gateway to\nyour world, a means of contact with your plane of existence for those\nmany vicious hordes that dwell in other planes of the fifth dimension.\nWithout it, the Bardeks had not been able to enter and effect the\nkidnaping of your friends. Oh, I tried so hard to warn them--Parker\nand the girl--but could not do it in time.\"\n\nA measure of understanding came to Bert Redmond. This was the thing\nJoan had feared and which Tom Parker had neglected to consider. The\nforces which enabled the scientist to see into the mysterious planes\nof this uncharted realm were likewise capable of providing physical\ncontact between the planes, or actual travel from one to the other.\nTom had not learned how to use the forces in this manner, but the\nBardeks had.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"We travel now along a different set of coordinates, those of\nspace-time,\" said the Wanderer. \"We go into the past, through eons of\ntime as it is counted in your world.\"\n\n\"Into the past,\" Bert repeated. He stared foolishly at his host, whose\neyes glittered strangely in the flickering light.\n\n\"Yes, we go to my home--to what was my home.\"\n\n\"To your home? Why?\" Bert shrank before the awful contorted face of\nthe Wanderer. A spasm of ferocity had crossed it on his last words.\nSome fearful secret must be gnawing at the big man's vitals.\n\n\"Again you must trust me. To understand, it is necessary that you\nsee.\"\n\nThe gentle whir of machinery rose to a piercing shriek as the Wanderer\nmanipulated the tiny levers of a control board that was set in the\nsmooth transparent wall. And the rushing light-forms outside became a\nblur at first, then a solid stream of cold liquid fire into which they\nplunged at breakneck speed.\n\nThere was no perceptible motion of the sphere, however. It was the\nonly object that seemed substantial and fixed in an intangible and\nmadly gyrating universe. Its curved wall, though transparent, was\nsolid, comforting to the touch.\n\nStanding by his instrument board, the Wanderer was engrossed in a\ntabulation of mathematical data he was apparently using in setting the\nmany control knobs before him. Plotting their course through infinity!\nHis placid serenity of countenance had returned, but there was a new\neagerness in his intense gaze and his strong fingers trembled while he\nmanipulated the tiny levers and dials.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOutside the apparently motionless sphere, a never-ending riot of color\nsurged swiftly and silently by, now swirling violently in great\nsweeping arcs of blinding magnificence, now changing character and\ndriving down from dizzying heights as a dim-lit column of gray that\nmight have been a blast of steam from some huge inverted geyser of the\ncosmos. Always there were the intermittent black bands that flashed\nswiftly across the brightness, momentarily darkening the sphere and\nthen passing on into the limbo of this strange realm between planes.\n\nAbruptly then, like the turning of a page in some gigantic book, the\nswift-moving phantasmagoria swung back into the blackness of the\ninfinite and was gone. Before them stretched a landscape of rolling\nhills and fertile valleys. Overhead, the skies were a deep blue,\nalmost violet, and twin suns shone down on the scene. The sphere\ndrifted along a few hundred feet from the surface.\n\n\"Urtraria!\" the Wanderer breathed reverently. His white head was bowed\nand his great hands clutched the small rail of the control board.\n\nIn a daze of conflicting emotions, Bert watched as this land of peace\nand plenty slipped past beneath them. This, he knew, had been the home\nof Wanderer. In what past age or at how great a distance it was from\nhis own world, he could only imagine. But that the big man who called\nhimself Wanderer loved this country there was not the slightest doubt.\nIt was a fetish with him, a past he was in duty bound to revisit time\nand again, and to mourn over.\n\nSmooth broad lakes, there were, and glistening streams that ran their\nwinding courses through well-kept and productive farmlands. And\nscattered communities with orderly streets and spacious parks. Roads,\nstretching endless ribbons of wide metallic surface across the\ncountryside. Long two-wheeled vehicles skimming over the roads with\nspeed so great the eye could scarcely follow them. Flapping-winged\nships of the air, flying high and low in all directions. A great city\nof magnificent dome-topped buildings looming up suddenly at the\nhorizon.\n\nThe sphere proceeded swiftly toward the city. Once a great air liner,\nflapping huge gossamerlike wings, drove directly toward them. Bert\ncried out in alarm and ducked instinctively, but the ship passed\n_through_ them and on its way. It was as if they did not exist in this\nspherical vehicle of the dimensions.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"We are here only as onlookers,\" the Wanderer explained sadly, \"and\ncan have no material existence here. We can not enter this plane, for\nthere is no gateway. Would that there were.\"\n\nNow they were over the city and the sphere came to rest above a\nspacious flat roof where there were luxurious gardens and pools, and a\nsmall glass-domed observatory. A woman was seated by one of the pools,\na beautiful woman with long golden hair that fell in soft profusion\nover her ivory shoulders and bosom. Two children, handsome stalwart\nboys of probably ten and twelve, romped with a domestic animal which\nresembled a foxhound of Earth but had glossy short-haired fur and\nflippers like these of a seal. Suddenly these three took to the water\nand splashed with much vigor and joyful shouting.\n\nThe Wanderer gripped Bert's arm with painful force. \"My home!\" he\ngroaned. \"Understand, Earthling? This was my home, these my wife and\nchildren--destroyed through my folly. Destroyed, I say, in ancient\ndays. And by my accursed hand--when the metal monsters came.\"\n\nThere was madness in the Wanderer's glassy stare, the madness of a\ntortured soul within. Bert began to fear him.\n\n\"We should leave,\" he said. \"Why torment yourself with such memories?\nMy friends....\"\n\n\"Have patience, Earthling. Don't you understand that I sinned and am\ntherefore condemned to this torment? Can't you see that I _must_\nunburden my soul of its ages-old load, that I must revisit the scene\nof my crime, that others must see and know? It is part of my\npunishment, and you, perforce, must bear witness. Moreover, it is to\nhelp your friends and your world that I bring you here. Behold!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA man was coming out of the observatory, a tall man with bronzed skin\nand raven locks. It was the Wanderer himself, the Wanderer of the\npast, as he had been in the days of his youth and happiness.\n\nThe woman by the pool had risen from her seat and was advancing\neagerly toward her mate. Bert saw that the man hardly glanced in her\ndirection, so intent was he upon an object over which he stood. The\nobject was a shimmering bowl some eight or ten feet across, which was\nmounted on a tripod near the observatory, and over whose metallic\nsurface a queer bluish light was playing.\n\nIt was a wordless pantomime, the ensuing scene, and Bert watched in\namazement. This woman of another race, another age, another plane, was\npleading with her man. Sobbing soundlessly, wretchedly. And the man\nwas unheeding, impatient with her demonstrations. He shoved her aside\nas she attempted to interfere with his manipulations of some elaborate\nmechanical contrivance at the side of the bowl.\n\nAnd then there was a sudden roaring vibration, a flash of light\nleaping from the bowl, and the materialization of a spherical vessel\nthat swallowed up the man and vanished in the shaft of light like a\nmoth in the flame of a candle.\n\nAt Bert's side, the Wanderer was a grim and silent figure, misty and\nunreal when compared with those material, emotion-torn beings of the\nrooftop. The woman, swooning, had wilted over the rim of the bowl, and\nthe two boys with their strange amphibious pet splashed out from the\npool and came running to her, wide-eyed and dripping.\n\nThe Wanderer touched a lever and again there was the sensation as of a\ngreat page turned across the vastness of the universe. All was hazy\nand indistinct outside the sphere that held them, with a rushing blur\nof dimly gray light-forms. Beneath them remained only the bright\noutline of the bowl, an object distinct and real and fixed in space.\n\n\"It was thus I left my loved ones,\" the Wanderer said hollowly. \"In\nfanatical devotion to my science, but in blind disregard of those\nthings which really mattered. Observe, O Man-Called-Bert, that the\nbowl is still existent in infra-dimensional space--the gateway I left\nopen to Urtraria. So it remained while I, fool that I was, explored\nthose planes of the fifth dimension that were all around us though we\nsaw and felt them not. Only I had seen, even as your friend Tom has\nseen. And, like him, I heeded not the menace of the things I had\nwitnessed. We go now to the plane of the metal monsters. Behold!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sphere shuddered to the increased power of its hidden motors and\nanother huge page seemed to turn slowly over, lurching sickeningly as\nit came to rest in the new and material plane of existence. Here, Bert\nunderstood now, the structure of matter was entirely different. Atoms\nwere comprised of protons and electrons whirling at different\nvelocities and in different orbits--possibly some of the electrons in\nreverse direction to those of the atomic structure of matter in\nUrtraria. And these coexisted with those others in the same relative\nposition in time and in space. Ages before, the thing had happened,\nand he was seeing it now.\n\nThey were in the midst of a forest of conical spires whose sides were\nof dark glittering stuff that reminded Bert of the crystals of\ncarborundum before pulverizing for commercial use. A myriad of deep\ncolors were reflected from the sharply pointed piles in the light of\na great cold moon that hung low in the heavens above them.\n\nIn the half light down there between the circular bases of the cones,\nweird creatures were moving. Like great earthworms they moved,\nsluggishly and with writhing contortions of their many-jointed bodies.\nLong cylindrical things with glistening gray hide, like armor plate\nand with fearsome heads that reared upward occasionally to reveal the\nsingle flaming eye and massive iron jaws each contained. There were\nriveted joints and levers, wheels and gears that moved as the\ncreatures moved; darting lights that flashed forth from\ntrunnion-mounted cases like the searchlights of a battleship of Earth;\ngreat swiveled arms with grappling hooks attached. They were\nmechanical contrivances--the metal monsters of which the Wanderer had\nspoken. Whether their brains were comprised of active living cells or\nwhether they were cold, calculating machines of metallic parts, Bert\nwas never to know.\n\n\"See, the gateway,\" the Wanderer was saying. \"They are investigating.\nIt is the beginning of the end of Urtraria--all as it occurred in the\ndim and distant past.\"\n\nHe gripped Bert's arm, pointing a trembling finger, and his face was a\nterrible thing to see in the eery light of their sphere.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA sharply outlined circle of blue-white appeared down there in the\nmidst of the squirming monsters. The sphere drifted lower and Bert was\nable to see that a complicated machine was being trundled out from an\narched doorway in the base of one of the conical dwellings. It was\nmoved to the edge of the light circle which was the bowl on that\nrooftop of Urtraria. The same bowl! A force area like that used by Tom\nParker, an area existent in many planes of the fifth dimension\nsimultaneously, an area where the various components of wave motion\nmerged and became as one. The gateway between planes!\n\nThe machine of the metal monsters was provided with a huge lens and a\nreflector, and these were trained on the bowl. Wheels and levers of\nthe machine moved swiftly. There came an orange light from within that\nwas focused upon lens and reflector to strike down and mingle with the\ncold light of the bowl. A startling transformation ensued, for the\nentire area within view was encompassed with a milky diffused\nbrightness in which two worlds seemed to intermingle and fuse. There\nwere the rooftops of the city in Urtraria and its magnificent domes, a\ntransparent yet substantial reality superimposed upon the gloomy city\nof cones of the metal monsters.\n\n\"Jupiter!\" Bert breathed. \"They're going through!\"\n\n\"They are, Earthling. More accurately, they did--thousands of them;\nmillions.\" Even as the Wanderer spoke, the metal monsters were\nwriggling through between the two planes, their enormous bodies moving\nwith menacing deliberation.\n\nOn the rooftops back in Urtraria could be seen the frantic, fleeing\nforms of humanlike beings--the Wanderer's people.\n\nThere was a sharp click from the control panel and the scene was\nblotted out by the familiar maze of geometric shapes, the whirling,\ndancing light-forms that rushed madly past over the vast arch which\nspanned infinity.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Where were you at the time?\" asked Bert. Awed by what he had seen and\nwith pity in his heart for the man who had unwittingly let loose the\nhorde of metal monsters on his own loved ones and his own land, he\nstared at the Wanderer.\n\nThe big man was standing with face averted, hands clutching the rail\nof the control panel desperately. \"I?\" he whispered. \"I was roaming\nthe planes, exploring, experimenting, immersed in the pursuits that\nwent with my insatiable thirst for scientific data and the broadening\nof my knowledge of this complex universe of ours. Forgetting my\nresponsibilities. Unknowing, unsuspecting.\"\n\n\"You returned--to your home?\"\n\n\"Too late I returned. You shall see; we return now by the same route I\nthen followed.\"\n\n\"No!\" Bert shouted, suddenly panicky at thought of what might be\nhappening to Joan and Tom in the land of the Bardeks. \"No,\nWanderer--tell me, but don't show me. I can imagine. Seeing those\nloathsome big worms of iron and steel, I can well visualize what they\ndid. Come now, have a heart, man; take me to my friends before....\"\n\n\"Ah-h!\" The Wanderer looked up and a benign look came to take the\nplace of the pain and horror which had contorted his features. \"It is\nwell, O Man-Called-Bert. I shall do as you request, for I now see that\nmy mission has been well accomplished. We go to your friends, and fear\nyou not that we shall arrive too late.\"\n\n\"Your--your mission?\" Bert calmed immediately under the spell of the\nWanderer's new mood.\n\n\"My mission throughout eternity, Earthling--can't you sense it?\nForever and ever I shall roam infra-dimensional space, watching and\nwaiting for evidence that a similar catastrophe might be visited on\nanother land where warm-blooded thinking humans of similar mold to my\nown may be living out their short lives of happiness or\nnear-happiness. Never again shall so great a calamity come to mankind\nanywhere if it be within the Wanderer's power to prevent it. And that\nis why I snatched you up from your friend's laboratory. That is why I\nhave shown to you the--\"\n\n\"Me, why me?\" Bert exclaimed.\n\n\"Attend, O Earthling, and you shall hear.\"\n\nThe mysterious intangibilities of the cosmos whirled by unheeded by\neither as the Wanderer's tale unfolded.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"When I returned,\" he said, \"the gateway was closed forever. I could\nnot reenter my own plane of existence. The metal monsters had taken\npossession; they had found a better and richer land than their own,\nand when they had completed their migration they destroyed the\ngenerator of my force area. They had shut me out; but I could visit\nUrtraria--as an outsider, as a wraith--and I saw what they had done. I\nsaw the desolation and the blackness of my once fair land. I saw\nthat--that none of my own kind remained. All, all were gone.\n\n\"For a time my reason deserted me and I roamed infra-dimensional space\na madman, self-condemned to the outer realms where there is no real\nmaterial existence, no human companionship, no love, no comfort. When\nreason returned, I set myself to the task of visiting other planes\nwhere beings of my own kind might be found and I soon learned that it\nwas impossible to do this in the body. To these people I was a ghostly\nvisitant, if they sensed my presence at all, for my roamings between\nplanes had altered the characteristics of atomic structure of my\nbeing. I could no longer adapt myself to material existence in these\nplanes of the fifth dimension. The orbits of electrons in the atoms\ncomprising my substance had become fixed in a new and outcast\noscillation interval. I had remained away too long. I was an outcast,\na wanderer--the Wanderer of Infinity.\"\n\nThere was silence in the sphere for a space, save only for the gentle\nwhirring of the motors. Then the Wanderer continued:\n\n\"Nevertheless, I roamed these planes as a nonexistent visitor in so\nfar as their peoples were concerned. I learned their languages and\ncame to think of them as my own, and I found that many of their\nscientific workers were experimenting along lines similar to those\nwhich had brought disaster to Urtraria. I swore a mighty oath to spend\nmy lifetime in warning them, in warding off a repetition of so\nterrible a mistake as I had made. On several occasions I have\nsucceeded.\n\n\"And then I found that my lifetime was to be for all eternity. In the\nouter realms time stands still, as I have told you, and in the plane\nof existence which was now mine--an extra-material plane--I had no\nprospect of aging or of death. My vow, therefore, is for so long as\nour universe may endure instead of for merely a lifetime. For this I\nam duly thankful, for I shall miss nothing until the end of time.\n\n\"I visited planes where other monsters, as clever and as vicious as\nthe metal ones who devastated Urtraria, were bending every effort of\ntheir sciences toward obtaining actual contact with other planes of\nthe fifth dimension. And I learned that such contact was utterly\nimpossible of attainment without a gateway in the realm to which they\nwished to pass--a gateway such as I had provided for the metal\nmonsters and such as that which your friend Tom Parker has provided\nfor the Bardeks, or spider men, as you term them.\n\n\"In intra-dimensional space I saw the glow of Tom Parker's force area\nand I made my way to your world quickly. But Tom could not get my\nwarning: he was too stubbornly and deeply engrossed in the work he was\nengaged in. The girl Joan was slightly more susceptible, and I believe\nshe was beginning to sense my telepathic messages when she sent for\nyou. Still and all, I had begun to give up hope when you came on the\nscene. I took you away just as the spider men succeeded in capturing\nyour friends, and now my hope has revived. I feel sure that my warning\nshall not have been in vain.\"\n\n\"But,\" objected Bert, \"you've warned _me_, not the scientist of my\nworld who is able to prevent the thing--\"\n\n\"Yes, _you_,\" the Wanderer broke in. \"It is better so. This Tom Parker\nis a zealot even as was I--a man of science thinking only of his own\ndiscoveries. I am not sure he would discontinue his experiments even\nwere he to receive my warning in all its horrible details. But you, O\nMan-Called-Bert, through your love of his sister and by your influence\nover him, will be able to do what I can not do myself: bring about the\ndestruction of this apparatus of his; impress upon him the grave\nnecessity of discontinuing his investigations. You can do it, and you\nalone, now that you fully understand.\"\n\n\"Sa-ay! You're putting it up to me entirely?\"\n\n\"Nearly so, and there is no alternative. I believe I have not\nmisjudged you; you will not fail, of that I am certain. For the sake\nof your own kind, for the love of Joan Parker--you will not fail. And\nfor me--for this small measure of atonement it is permitted that I\nmake or help to make possible--\"\n\n\"No, I'll not fail. Take me to them, quick.\" Bert grinned\nunderstandingly as the Wanderer straightened his broad shoulders and\nextended his hand.\n\nThere was no lack of substantiality in the mighty grip of those\nclosing fingers.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAgain the sphere's invisible motors increased speed, and again the\ndizzying kaleidoscope of color swept past them more furiously.\n\n\"We will now overtake them--your friends,\" said the Wanderer, \"in the\nvery act of passing between planes.\"\n\n\"Overtake them....\" Bert mumbled. \"I don't get it at all, this time\ntraveling. It's over my head a mile.\"\n\n\"It isn't time travel really,\" explained the Wanderer. \"We are merely\nclosing up the time-space interval, moving to the precise spot in the\nuniverse where your friend's laboratory existed at the moment of\ncontact between planes with your world and that of the Bardeks. We\nshall reach there a few seconds after the actual capture.\"\n\n\"No chance of missing?\" Bert watched the Wanderer as he consulted his\nmathematical data and made new adjustments of the controls.\n\n\"Not the slightest; it is calculated to a nicety. We could, if we\nwished, stop just short of the exact time and would see the\nre-occurrence of their capture. But only as unseen observers--you can\nnot enter the plane as a material being during your own actual past,\nfor your entity would then be duplicated. Of course, I can not enter\nin any case. But, moving on to the instant after the event, as we\nshall do, you may enter either plane as a material being or move\nbetween the two planes at will by means of the gateway provided by Tom\nParker's force area. Do you not now understand the manner in which you\nwill be enabled to carry out the required procedure?\"\n\n\"H-hmm!\" Bert wasn't sure at all. \"But this moving through time,\" he\nasked helplessly, \"and the change from one plane of oscillation to\nanother--they're all mixed up--what have they to do with each other?\"\n\n\"All five dimensions of our universe are definitely interrelated and\ndependent one upon the other for the existence of matter in any form\nwhatsoever. You see--but here we are.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe motors slowed down and a titanic page seemed to turn over in the\ncosmos with a vanishing blaze of magnificence. Directly beneath them\nglowed the disk of blue-white light that was Tom's force area. The\nsphere swooped down within its influence and came to rest.\n\n\"Make haste,\" the Wanderer said. \"I shall be here in the gateway\nthough you see me not. Bring them here, speedily.\"\n\nOn the one side Bert saw familiar objects in Tom's laboratory, on the\nother side the white cliff and the pitchy sea of the Bardek realm. And\nthe cage of basket-weave between, with his friends inside struggling\nwith the spider men. It was the instant after the capture.\n\n\"Joan! Tom!\" Bert shouted.\n\nA side of the sphere had opened and he plunged through and into the\nBardek plane--to the inky surface of the sea, fully expecting to sink\nin its forbidding depths. But the stuff was an elastic solid, springy\nunder his feet and bearing him up as would an air-inflated cushion. He\nthrew himself upon the cage and tore at it with his fingers.\n\nThe whimpering screams of the spider men were in his ears, and he saw\nfrom the corner of his eye that other of the tortoiselike mounds were\nrising up out of the viscid black depths, dozens of them, and that\nhundreds of the Bardeks were closing in on him from all directions.\nWeapons were in their hands, and a huge engine of warfare like a\ncaterpillar tractor was skimming over the sea from the cliff wall with\na great grinding and clanking of its mechanisms.\n\nBut the cage was pulling apart in his clutches as if made of reeds.\nWith Joan in one encircling arm he was battling the spider men,\ndriving swift short-arm jabs into their soft bloated bodies with\ndevastating effect. And Tom, recovering from the first surprise of his\ncapture, was doing a good job himself, his flailing arms scattering\nthe Bardeks like ninepins. The Wanderer and his sphere, both doomed to\nmaterial existence only in infra-dimensional space, had vanished from\nsight.\n\nA bedlam rose up from the reinforcing hordes as they came in to enter\nthe force area. But Bert sensed the guiding touch of the Wanderer's\nunseen hand, heard his placid voice urging him, and, in a single wild\nleap was inside the sphere with the girl.\n\nWith Joan safely in the Wanderer's care, he rushed out again for Tom.\nThen followed a nightmare of battling those twining tentacles and the\npuffy crowding bodies of the spider men. Wrestling tactics and\nswinging fists were all that the two Earthlings had to rely upon, but,\nbetween them, they managed to fight off a half score of the Bardeks\nand work their way back into the glowing force area.\n\n\"It's no use,\" Tom gasped. \"We can't get back.\"\n\n\"Sure we can. We've a friend--here--in the force area.\"\n\nTom Parker staggered: his strength was giving out. \"No, no, Bert,\" he\nmoaned, \"I can't. You go on. Leave me here.\"\n\n\"Not on your life!\" Bert swung him up bodily into the sphere as he\ncontacted with the invisible metal of its hull. Kicking off the\nnearest of the spider men, he clambered in after the scientist.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe tableau then presented in the sphere's interior was to remain\nforever imprinted on Bert's memory, though it was only a momentary\nflash in his consciousness at the time: the Wanderer, calm and erect\nat the control panel, his benign countenance alight with satisfaction;\nTom Parker, pulling himself to his feet, clutching at the big man's\nfree arm, his mouth opened in astonishment; Joan, seated at the\nWanderer's feet with awed and reverent eyes upturned.\n\nThere is no passing directly between the planes. One must have the\nforce area as a gateway, and, besides, a medium such as the cage of\nthe Bardeks, the orange light of the metal monsters, or the sphere of\nthe Wanderer. Bert knew this instinctively as the sphere darkened and\nthe flashing light-forms leaped across the blackness.\n\nThe motors screamed in rising crescendo as their speed increased.\nThen, abruptly, the sound broke off into deathly silence as the limit\nof audibility was passed. Against the brilliant background of swift\ncolor changes and geometric light-shapes that so quickly merged into\nthe familiar blur, Bert saw his companions as dim wraithlike forms. He\nmoved toward Joan, groping.\n\nThen came the tremendous thump, the swinging of a colossal page across\nthe void, the warping of the very universe about them, the physical\ntorture and the swift rush through Stygian inkiness....\n\n\"Farewell.\" A single word, whispered like a benediction in the\nWanderer's mellow voice, was in Bert's consciousness. He knew that\ntheir benefactor had slipped away into the mysterious regions of\nintra-dimensional space.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRaising himself slowly and dazedly from where he had been flung, he\nsaw they were in Tom's laboratory. Joan lay over there white and\nstill, a pitiful crumpled heap. Panicky, Bert crossed to her. His\ntrembling fingers found her pulse; a sobbing breath of relief escaped\nhis lips. She had merely swooned.\n\nTom Parker, exhausted from his efforts in that other plane and with\nthe very foundations of his being wrenched by the passage through the\nfifth dimension, was unable to rise. Only semiconscious, his eyes were\nglazed with pain, and incoherent moaning sounds came from his white\nlips when he attempted to speak.\n\nBert's mind was clearing rapidly. That diabolical machine of Tom's was\nstill operating, the drone of its motors being the only sound in the\nlaboratory as the inventor closed his mouth grimly and made a\ndesperate effort to raise his head. But Bert had seen shapes\nmaterializing on the lighted disk that was the gateway between planes\nand he rushed to the controls of the instrument. That starting lever\nmust be shifted without delay.\n\n\"Don't!\" Tom Parker had found his voice; his frantic warning was a\nhoarse whistling gasp. He had struggled to his knees. \"It will kill\nyou, Bert. Those things in the force area--partly through--the\nreaction will destroy the machine and all of us if you turn it off.\nDon't, I say!\"\n\n\"What then?\" Bert fell back appalled. Hazily, the steel prow of a war\nmachine was forming itself on the metal disk; caterpillar treads moved\nlike ghostly shadows beneath. It was the vanguard of the Bardek\nhordes!\n\n\"Can't do it that way!\" Tom had gotten to his feet and was stumbling\ntoward the force area. \"Only one way--during the change of oscillation\nperiods. Must mingle other atoms with those before they stabilize in\nour plane. Must localize annihilating force. Must--\"\n\nWhat was the fool doing? He'd be in the force area in another moment.\nBert thrust forward to intercept him; saw that Joan had regained\nconsciousness and was sitting erect, swaying weakly. Her eyes widened\nwith horror as they took in the scene and she screamed once\ndespairingly and was on her feet, tottering.\n\n\"Back!\" Tom Parker yelled, wheeling. \"Save yourselves.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBert lunged toward him but was too late. Tom had already burst into\nthe force area and cast himself upon the semitransparent tank of the\nspider men. A blast of searing heat radiated from the disk and the\nmotors of Tom's machine groaned as they slowed down under a tremendous\noverload.\n\nJoan cried out in awful despair and moved to follow, but her knees\ngave way beneath her. Moaning and shuddering, she slumped into Bert's\narms and he drew her back from the awful heat of the force area.\n\nThen, horrified, they watched as Tom Parker melted into the misty\nshape of the Bardek war machine. Swiftly his body merged with the\nhalf-substance of the tank and became an integral part of the mass.\nFor a horrible instant Tom, too, was transparent--a ghost shape\nwrithing in a ghostly throbbing mechanism of another world. His own\natomic structure mingled with that of the alien thing and yet, for a\nmoment, he retained his Earthly form. His lean face was peaceful in\ndeath, satisfied, like the Wanderer's when they had last seen him.\n\nA terrific thunderclap rent the air and a column of flame roared up\nfrom the force area. Tom's apparatus glowed to instant white heat,\nthen melted down into sizzling liquid metal and glass. The laboratory\nwas in sudden twilight gloom, save for the tongue of fire that licked\nup from the force area to the paneled ceiling. On the metal disk, now\nglowing redly, was no visible thing. The gateway was closed forever.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhat more fearful calamity might have befallen had the machine been\nswitched off instead, Bert was never to know. Nor did he know how he\nreached his parked flivver with Joan a limp sobbing bundle in his\narms. He only knew that Tom Parker's sacrifice had saved them, had\nundoubtedly prevented a horrible invasion of Earth; and that the\nefforts of the Wanderer had not been in vain.\n\nThe old house was burning furiously when he climbed in under the wheel\nof his car. He held Joan very close and watched that blazing funeral\npyre in wordless sorrow as the bereaved girl dropped her head to his\nshoulder.\n\nA group of men came up the winding road, a straggling group,\nrunning--the loungers from the village. In the forefront was the\nbeardless youth who had directed Bert, and, bringing up the rear,\nlimping and scurrying, was the old man they had called Gramp. He was\npuffing prodigiously when the others gathered around the car,\ndemanding information.\n\nAnd the old fellow with the thick spectacles talked them all down.\n\n\"What'd I tell you?\" he screeched. \"Didn't I say they was queer doin's\nup here? Didn't I say the devil was here with his imps--an' the\nthunder? You're a passel o' idjits like I said--\"\n\nThe roar of Bert's starting motor drowned out the rest, but the old\nfellow was still gesticulating and dancing about when they clattered\noff down the winding road to Lenville.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAn hour later Joan had fallen asleep, exhausted.\n\nNight had fallen and, as mile after mile of smooth concrete unrolled\nbeneath the flivver's wheels, Bert gave himself over to thoughts he\nhad not dared to entertain in nearly two years. They'd be happy, he\nand Joan, and there'd be no further argument. If she still objected to\nliving on the fruit farm, that could be managed easily. They'd live in\nIndianapolis and he'd buy a new car, a good one, to run back and\nforth. If, when her grief for Tom had lessened, she wanted to go on\nwith laboratory work and such--well, that was easy, too. Only there\nwould be no fooling around with this dimensional stuff--she'd had\nenough of that, he knew.\n\nHe drew her close with his free arm and his thoughts shifted--moved\nfar out in infra-dimensional space to dwell upon the man of the past\nwho had called himself Wanderer of Infinity. He who would go on and on\nuntil the end of time, until the end of all things, watching over the\nmany worlds and planes. Warning peoples of humanlike mold and emotions\nwherever they might dwell. Helping them. Atoning throughout infinity.\nSuffering.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Wanderer of Infinity, by Harl Vincent\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK WANDERER OF INFINITY ***\n\n***** This file should be named 29408.txt or 29408.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/9/4/0/29408/\n\nProduced by Sankar Viswanathan, Greg Weeks, and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
