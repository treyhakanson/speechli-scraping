In\n     what was undoubtedly the most spectacular feat of the century, it\n     simply picked itself up one night and rose two full miles above\n     Earth!\n\n     Radio messages stated simply that Superior had seceded from Earth.\n     But Don Cort, stranded on that rising town, was beginning to\n     suspect that nothing was simple about Superior except its citizens.\n     Calmly they accepted their rise in the world as being due to one of\n     their local townspeople, a crackpot professor.\n\n     But after a couple of weeks of floating around, it began to be\n     obvious that the professor had no idea how to get them down. So\n     then it was up to Cort: either find a way to anchor Superior, or\n     spend the rest of his days on the smallest--and the\n     nuttiest--planet in the galaxy!\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nThe town of Superior, Ohio, disappeared on the night of October 31.\n\nA truck driver named Pierce Knaubloch was the first to report it. He had\nbeen highballing west along Route 202, making up for the time he'd spent\nover a second cup of coffee in a diner, when he screeched to a stop. If\nhe'd gone another twenty-five feet he'd have gone into the pit where\nSuperior had been.\n\nKnaubloch couldn't see the extent of the pit because it was too dark,\nbut it looked big. Bigger than if a nitro truck had blown up, which was\nhis first thought. He backed up two hundred feet, set out flares, then\nsped off to a telephone.\n\nThe state police converged on the former site of Superior from several\ndirections. Communicating by radiophone across the vast pit, they\nconfirmed that the town undoubtedly was missing. They put in a call to\nthe National Guard.\n\nThe guard surrounded the area with troops--more than a thousand were\nneeded--to keep people from falling into the pit. A pilot who flew over\nit reported that it looked as if a great ice-cream scoop had bitten into\nthe Ohio countryside.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Railroad complained that one of its passenger trains\nwas missing. The train's schedule called for it to pass through but not\nstop at Superior at 11:58. That seemed to fix the time of the\ndisappearance at midnight. The truck driver had made his discovery\nshortly after midnight.\n\nSomeone pointed out that October 31 was Halloween and that midnight was\nthe witching hour.\n\nSomebody else said nonsense, they'd better check for radiation. A civil\ndefense official brought up a Geiger counter, but no matter how he shook\nit and rapped on it, it refused to click.\n\nA National Guard officer volunteered to take a jeep down into the pit,\nhaving found a spot that seemed navigable. He was gone a long time but\nwhen he came out the other side he reported that the pit was concave,\nrelatively smooth, and did not smell of high explosives. He'd found no\npeople, no houses--no sign of anything except the pit itself.\n\nThe Governor of Ohio asked Washington whether any unidentified planes\nhad been over the state. Washington said no. The Pentagon and the Atomic\nEnergy Commission denied that they had been conducting secret\nexperiments.\n\nNor had there been any defense plants in Superior that might have blown\nup. The town's biggest factory made kitchen sinks and the next biggest\nmade bubble gum.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA United Airlines pilot found Superior early on the morning of November\n1. The pilot, Captain Eric Studley, who had never seen a flying saucer\nand hoped never to see one, was afraid now that he had. The object\nloomed out of a cloudbank at twelve thousand feet and Studley changed\ncourse to avoid it. He noted with only minimum satisfaction that his\nco-pilot also saw the thing and wondered why it wasn't moving at the\nterrific speed flying saucers were allegedly capable of.\n\nThen he saw the church steeple on it.\n\nA few minutes later he had relayed a message from Superior, formerly of\nOhio, addressed to whom it might concern:\n\nIt said that Superior had seceded from Earth.\n\nOne other radio message came from Superior, now airborne, on that first\nday. A ham radio operator reported an unidentified voice as saying\nplaintively:\n\n\"_Cold_ up here!\"\n\nDon Cort had been dozing in what passed for the club car on the Buckeye\nCannonball when the train braked to a stop. He looked out the window,\nhoping this was Columbus, where he planned to catch a plane east. But it\nwasn't Columbus. All he could see were some lanterns jogging as trainmen\nhurried along the tracks.\n\nThe conductor looked into the car. The redhead across the aisle in whom\nDon had taken a passing interest earlier in the evening asked, \"Why did\nwe stop?\"\n\n\"Somebody flagged us down,\" the conductor said. \"We don't make a station\nstop at Superior on this run.\"\n\nThe girl's hair was a subtle red, but false. When Don had entered the\nclub car he'd seen her hatless head from above and noticed that the hair\nalong the part was dark. Her eyes had been on a book and Don had the\nopportunity for a brief study of her face. The cheeks were full and\nuntouched by make-up. There were lines at the corners of her mouth which\nindicated a tendency to arrange her expression into one of disapproval.\nThe lips were full, like the cheeks, but it was obvious that the scarlet\nlipstick had contrived a mouth a trifle bigger than the one nature had\ngiven her.\n\nHer glance upward at that moment interrupted his examination, which had\nbeen about to go on to her figure. Later, though, he was able to observe\nthat it was more than adequate.\n\nIf the girl had given Don Cort more than that one glance, or if it had\nbeen a trained, all-encompassing glance, she would have seen a man in\nhis mid-twenties--about her age--lean, tall and straight-shouldered,\nwith once-blond hair now verging on dark brown, a face neither handsome\nnor ugly, and a habit of drawing the inside of his left cheek between\nhis teeth and nibbling at it thoughtfully.\n\nBut it was likely that all she noticed then was the brief case he\ncarried, attached by a chain to a handcuff on his left wrist.\n\n\"Will we be here long?\" Don asked the conductor. He didn't want to miss\nhis plane at Columbus. The sooner he got to Washington, the sooner he'd\nget rid of the brief case. The handcuff it was attached to was one\nreason why his interest in the redhead had been only passing.\n\n\"Can't say,\" the conductor told him. He let the door close again and\nwent down to the tracks.\n\nDon hesitated, shrugged at the redhead, said, \"Excuse me,\" and followed\nthe conductor. About a dozen people were milling around the train as it\nsat in the dark, hissing steam. Don made his way up to the locomotive\nand found a bigger knot of people gathered in front of the cowcatcher.\n\nSome sort of barricade had been put up across the tracks and it was\ncovered with every imaginable kind of warning device. There were red\nlanterns, both battery and electric; flashlights; road flares; and even\nan old red shirt.\n\nDon saw two men who must have been the engineer and the fireman talking\nto an old bearded gentleman wearing a civil defense helmet, a topcoat\nand riding boots.\n\n\"You'd go over the edge, I tell you,\" the old gentleman was saying.\n\n\"If you don't get this junk off the line,\" the engineer said, \"I'll plow\nright through it. Off the edge! you crazy or something?\"\n\n\"Look for yourself,\" the old man in the white helmet said. \"Go ahead.\nLook.\"\n\nThe engineer was exasperated. He turned to the fireman. \"You look. Humor\nthe old man. Then let's go.\"\n\nThe bearded man--he called himself Professor Garet--went off with the\nfireman. Don followed them. They had tramped a quarter of a mile along\nthe gravel when the fireman stopped. \"Okay,\" he said \"where's the edge?\nI don't see nothing.\" The tracks seemed to stretch forever into the\ndarkness.\n\n\"It's another half mile or so,\" the professor said.\n\n\"Well, let's hurry up. We haven't got all night.\"\n\nThe old man chuckled. \"I'm afraid you have.\"\n\nThey came to it at last, stopping well back from it. Professor Garet\nswelled with pride, it seemed, as he made a theatrical gesture.\n\n\"Behold,\" he said. \"Something even Columbus couldn't find. The edge of\nthe world.\"\n\nTrue, everything seemed to stop, and they could see stars shining low on\nthe horizon where stars could not properly be expected to be seen.\n\nDon Cort and the fireman walked cautiously toward the edge while the\nprofessor ambled ahead with the familiarity of one who had been there\nbefore. But there was a wind and they did not venture too close.\nNevertheless, Don could see that it apparently was a neat, sharp edge,\nnot one of your old ragged, random edges such as might have been caused\nby an explosion. This one had the feeling of design behind it.\n\nStanding on tiptoe and repressing a touch of giddiness, Don looked over\nthe edge. He didn't have to stand on tiptoe any more than he had to sit\non the edge of his seat during the exciting part of a movie, but the\nsituation seemed to call for it. Over the edge could be seen a big\nsection of Ohio. At least he supposed it was Ohio.\n\nDon looked at the fireman, who had an unbelieving expression on his\nface, then at the bearded old man, who was smiling and nodding.\n\n\"You see what I mean,\" he said. \"You would have gone right over. I\nbelieve you would have had a two-mile fall.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Of course you could have stayed aboard the train,\" the man driving the\nold Pontiac said, \"but I really think you'll be more comfortable at\nCavalier.\"\n\nDon Cort, sitting in the back seat of the car with the redhead from the\nclub car, asked, \"Cavalier?\"\n\n\"The college. The institute, really; it's not accredited. What did you\nsay your name was, miss?\"\n\n\"Jen Jervis,\" she said. \"Geneva Jervis, formally.\"\n\n\"Miss Jervis. I'm Civek. You know Mr. Cort, I suppose.\"\n\nThe girl smiled sideways. \"We have a nodding acquaintance.\" Don nodded\nand grinned.\n\n\"There's plenty of room in the dormitories,\" Civek said. \"People don't\nexactly pound on the gates and scream to be admitted to Cavalier.\"\n\n\"Are you connected with the college?\" Don asked.\n\n\"Me? No. I'm the mayor of Superior. The old town's really come up in the\nworld, hasn't it?\"\n\n\"Overnight,\" Geneva Jervis said. \"If what Mr. Cort and the fireman say\nis true. I haven't seen the edge myself.\"\n\n\"You'll have a better chance to look at it in the morning,\" the mayor\nsaid, \"if we don't settle back in the meantime.\"\n\n\"Was there any sort of explosion?\" Don asked.\n\n\"No. There wasn't any sensation at all, as far as I noticed. I was\nwatching the late show--or trying to. My house is down in a hollow and\nreception isn't very good, especially with old English movies. Well, all\nof a sudden the picture sharpened up and I could see just as plain. Then\nthe phone rang and it was Professor Garet.\"\n\n\"The old fellow with the whiskers and the riding boots?\" Jen Jervis\nasked.\n\n\"Yes. Osbert Garet, Professor of Magnology at the Cavalier Institute of\nApplied Sciences.\"\n\n\"Professor of what?\"\n\n\"Magnology. As I say, the school isn't accredited. Well, Professor\nGaret telephoned and said, 'Hector'--that's my name, Hector\nCivek--'everything's up in the air.' He was having his little joke, of\ncourse. I said, 'What?' and then he told me.\"\n\n\"Told you what?\" Jen Jervis asked. \"I mean, does he have any theory\nabout it?\"\n\n\"He has a theory about everything. I think what he was trying to convey\nwas that this--this levitation confirmed his magnology principle.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" Don asked.\n\n\"I haven't the faintest idea. I'm a politician, not a scientist.\nProfessor Garet went on about it for a while, on the telephone, about\nmagnetism and gravity, but I think he was only calling as a courtesy, so\nthe mayor wouldn't look foolish the next morning, not knowing his town\nhad flown the coop.\"\n\n\"What's the population of Superior?\"\n\n\"Three thousand, including the students at the institute. Three thousand\nand forty, counting you people from the train. I guess you'll be with us\nfor a while.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\" Jen Jervis asked.\n\n\"Well, I don't see how you can get down. Do you?\"\n\n\"Does Superior have an airport?\" Don asked. \"I've got to get back to--to\nEarth.\" It sounded odd to put it that way.\n\n\"Nope,\" Civek said. \"No airport. No place for a plane to land, either.\"\n\n\"Maybe not a plane,\" Don said, \"but a helicopter could land just about\nanywhere.\"\n\n\"No helicopters here, either.\"\n\n\"Maybe not. But I'll bet they're swarming all over you by morning.\"\n\n\"Hm,\" said Hector Civek. Don couldn't quite catch his expression in the\nrearview mirror. \"I suppose they could, at that. Well, here's Cavalier.\nYou go right in that door, where the others are going. There's Professor\nGaret. I've got to see him--excuse me.\"\n\nThe mayor was off across the campus. Don looked at Geneva Jervis, who\nwas frowning. \"Are you thinking,\" he asked, \"that Mayor Civek was\nperhaps just a little less than completely honest with us?\"\n\n\"I'm thinking,\" she said, \"that I should have stayed with Aunt Hattie\nanother night, then taken a plane to Washington.\"\n\n\"Washington?\" Don said. \"That's where I'm going. I mean where I _was_\ngoing before Superior became airborne. What do you do in Washington,\nMiss Jervis?\"\n\n\"I work for the Government. Doesn't everybody?\"\n\n\"Not everybody. Me, for instance.\"\n\n\"No?\" she said. \"Judging by that satchel you're handcuffed to, I'd have\nthought you were a courier for the Pentagon. Or maybe State.\"\n\nHe laughed quickly and loudly because she was getting uncomfortably\nclose. \"Oh, no. Nothing so glamorous. I'm a messenger for the Riggs\nNational Bank, that's all. Where do you work?\"\n\n\"I'm with Senator Bobby Thebold, S.O.B.\"\n\nDon laughed again. \"He sure is.\"\n\n\"_Mister_ Cort!\" she said, annoyed. \"You know as well as I do that\nS.O.B. stands for Senate Office Building. I'm his secretary.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry. We'd better get out and find a place to sleep. It's getting\nlate.\"\n\n\"_Places_ to sleep,\" she corrected. She looked angry.\n\n\"Of course,\" Don said, puzzled by her emphasis. \"Come on. Where they put\nyou, you'll probably be surrounded by co-eds, even if I could get out of\nthis cuff.\"\n\nHe took her bag in his free hand and they were met by a gray-haired\nwoman who introduced herself as Mrs. Garet. \"We'll try to make you\ncomfortable,\" she said. \"What a night, eh? The professor is simply\nbeside himself. We haven't had so much excitement since the\ncosmolineator blew up.\"\n\nThey had a glimpse of the professor, still in his CD helmet, going\naround a corner, gesticulating wildly to someone wearing a white\nlaboratory smock.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nDon Cort had slept, but not well. He had tried to fold the brief case to\npull it through his sleeve so he could take his coat off, but whatever\nwas inside the brief case was too big. Cavalier had given him a room to\nhimself at one end of a dormitory and he'd taken his pants off but had\nhad to sleep with his coat and shirt on. He got up, feeling gritty, and\ndid what little dressing was necessary.\n\nIt was eight o'clock, according to the watch on the unhandcuffed wrist,\nand things were going on. He had a view of the campus from his window. A\nbright sun shone on young people moving generally toward a squat\nbuilding, and other people going in random directions. The first were\nstudents going to breakfast, he supposed, and the others were faculty\nmembers. The air was very clear and the long morning shadows distinct.\nOnly then did he remember completely that he and the whole town of\nSuperior were up in the air.\n\nHe went through the dormitory. A few students were still sleeping. The\nothers had gone from their unmade beds. He shivered as he stepped\noutdoors. It was crisp, if not freezing, and his breath came out\nvisibly. First he'd eat, he decided, so he'd be strong enough to go take\na good look over the edge, in broad daylight, to the Earth below.\n\nThe mess hall, or whatever they called it, was cafeteria style and he\ngot in line with a tray for juice, eggs and coffee. He saw no one he\nknew, but as he was looking for a table a willowy blonde girl smiled and\ngestured to the empty place opposite her.\n\n\"You're Mr. Cort,\" she said. \"Won't you join me?\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" he said, unloading his tray. \"How did you know?\"\n\n\"The mystery man with the handcuff. You'd be hard to miss. I'm\nAlis--that's A-l-i-s, not A-l-i-c-e--Garet. Are you with the FBI? Or did\nyou escape from jail?\"\n\n\"How do you do. No, just a bank messenger. What an unusual name.\nProfessor Garet's daughter?\"\n\n\"The same,\" she said. \"Also the only. A pity, because if there'd been\ntwo of us I'd have had a fifty-fifty chance of going to OSU. As it is,\nI'm duty-bound to represent the second generation at the nut factory.\"\n\n\"Nut factory? You mean Cavalier?\" Don struggled to manipulate knife and\nfork without knocking things off the table with his clinging brief case.\n\n\"Here, let me cut your eggs for you,\" Alis said. \"You'd better order\nthem scrambled tomorrow. Yes, Cavalier. Home of the crackpot theory and\nthe latter-day alchemist.\"\n\n\"I'm sure it's not that bad. Thanks. As for tomorrow, I hope to be out\nof here by then.\"\n\n\"How do you get down from an elephant? Old riddle. You don't; you get\ndown from ducks. How do you plan to get down from Superior?\"\n\n\"I'll find a way. I'm more interested at the moment in how I got up\nhere.\"\n\n\"You were levitated, like everybody else.\"\n\n\"You make it sound deliberate, Miss Garet, as if somebody hoisted a\nwhole patch of real estate for some fell purpose.\"\n\n\"Scarcely _fell_, Mr. Cort. As for it being deliberate, that seems to be\na matter of opinion. Apparently you haven't seen the papers.\"\n\n\"I didn't know there were any.\"\n\n\"Actually there's only one, the _Superior Sentry_, a weekly. This is an\nextra. Ed Clark must have been up all night getting it out.\" She opened\nher purse and unfolded a four-page tabloid.\n\nDon blinked at the headline:\n\n     TOWN GETS HIGH\n\n\"Ed Clark's something of an eccentric, like everybody else in Superior,\"\nAlis said.\n\nDon read the story, which seemed to him a capricious treatment of an\napparently grave situation.\n\n_Residents having business beyond the outskirts of town today are\nadvised not to. It's a long way down. Where Superior was surrounded by\nOhio, as usual, today Superior ends literally at the town line._\n\n_A Citizens' Emergency Fence-Building Committee is being formed, but in\nthe meantime all are warned to stay well away from the edge. The law of\ngravity seems to have been repealed for the town but it is doubtful if\nthe same exemption would apply to a dubious individual bent on\ninvestigating...._\n\nDon skimmed the rest. \"I don't see anything about it being deliberate.\"\n\nAlis had been creaming and sugaring Don's coffee. She pushed it across\nto him and said, \"It's not on page one. Ed Clark and Mayor Civek don't\nget along, so you'll find the mayor's statement in a box on page three,\nbottom.\"\n\nDon creased the paper the other way, took a sip of coffee, nodded his\nthanks, and read:\n\n     MAYOR CLAIMS SECESSION FROM EARTH\n\n_Mayor Hector Civek, in a proclamation issued locally by hand and\ndropped to the rest of the world in a plastic shatter-proof bottle, said\ntoday that Superior has seceded from Earth. His reasons were as vague as\nhis explanation._\n\n_The \"reasons\" include these: (1) Superior has been discriminated against\nby county, state and federal agencies; (2) Cavalier Institute has been\nheld up to global derision by orthodox (presumably meaning accredited)\ncolleges and universities; and (3) chicle exporters have conspired\nagainst the Superior Bubble Gum Company by unreasonably raising prices._\n\n_The \"explanation\" consists of a 63-page treatise on applied magnology by\nProfessor Osbert Garet of Cavalier which the editor (a) does not\nunderstand; (b) lacks space to publish; and which (it being atrociously\nhandwritten) he (c) has not the temerity to ask his linotype operator to\nset._\n\nDon said, \"I'm beginning to like this Ed Clark.\"\n\n\"He's a doll,\" Alis said. \"He's about the only one in town who stands up\nto Father.\"\n\n\"Does your father claim that _he_ levitated Superior off the face of the\nEarth?\"\n\n\"Not to me he doesn't. I'm one of those banes of his existence, a\nskeptic. He gave up trying to magnolize me when I was sixteen. I had a\nscience teacher in high school--not in Superior, incidentally--who gave\nme all kinds of embarrassing questions to ask Father. I asked them,\nbeing a natural-born needler, and Father has disowned me intellectually\never since.\"\n\n\"How old are you, Miss Garet, if I may ask?\"\n\nShe sat up straight and tucked her sweater tightly into her skirt,\nemphasizing her good figure. To a male friend Don would have described\nthe figure as outstanding. She had mocking eyes, a pert nose and a mouth\nof such moist red softness that it seemed perpetually waiting to be\nkissed. All in all she could have been the queen of a campus much more\ndensely populated with co-eds than Cavalier was.\n\n\"You may call me Alis,\" she said. \"And I'm nineteen.\"\n\nDon grinned. \"Going on?\"\n\n\"Three months past. How old are _you_, Mr. Cort?\"\n\n\"Don's the name I've had for twenty-six years. Please use it.\"\n\n\"Gladly. And now, Don, unless you want another cup of coffee, I'll go\nwith you to the end of the world.\"\n\n\"On such short notice?\" Don was intrigued. Last night the redhead from\nthe club car had repelled an advance that hadn't been made, and this\nmorning a blonde was apparently making an advance that hadn't been\nsolicited. He wondered where Geneva Jervis was, but only vaguely.\n\n\"I'll admit to the _double entendre_,\" Alis said. \"What I meant--for\nnow--was that we can stroll out to where Superior used to be attached to\nthe rest of Ohio and see how the Earth is getting along without us.\"\n\n\"Delighted. But don't you have any classes?\"\n\n\"Sure I do. Non-Einsteinian Relativity 1, at nine o'clock. But I'm a\ndemon class-cutter, which is why I'm still a Senior at my advanced age.\nOn to the brink!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey walked south from the campus and came to the railroad track. The\ntrain was standing there with nowhere to go. It had been abandoned\nexcept for the conductor, who had dutifully spent the night aboard.\n\n\"What's happening?\" he asked when he saw them. \"Any word from down\nthere?\"\n\n\"Not that I know of,\" Don said. He introduced him to Alis Garet. \"What\nare you going to do?\"\n\n\"What _can_ I do?\" the conductor asked.\n\n\"You can go over to Cavalier and have breakfast,\" Alis said. \"Nobody's\ngoing to steal your old train.\"\n\nThe conductor reckoned as how he might just do that, and did.\n\n\"You know,\" Don said, \"I was half-asleep last night but before the train\nstopped I thought it was running alongside a creek for a while.\"\n\n\"South Creek,\" Alis said. \"That's right. It's just over there.\"\n\n\"Is it still? I mean hasn't it all poured off the edge by now? Was that\nSuperior's water supply?\"\n\nAlis shrugged. \"All I know is you turn on the faucet and there's water.\nLet's go look at the creek.\"\n\nThey found it coursing along between the banks.\n\n\"Looks just about the same,\" she said.\n\n\"That's funny. Come on; let's follow it to the edge.\"\n\nThe brink, as Alis called it, looked even more awesome by daylight.\nEverything stopped short. There were the remnants of a cornfield, with\nthe withered stalks cut down, then there was nothing. There was South\nCreek surging along, then nothing. In the distance a clump of trees,\nwith a few autumn leaves still clinging to their branches, simply ended.\n\n\"Where is the water going?\" Don asked. \"I can't make it out.\"\n\n\"Down, I'd say. Rain for the Earth-people.\"\n\n\"I should think it'd be all dried up by now. I'm going to have a look.\"\n\n\"Don't! You'll fall off!\"\n\n\"I'll be careful.\" He walked cautiously toward the edge. Alis followed\nhim, a few feet behind. He stopped a yard from the brink and waited for\na spell of dizziness to pass. The Earth was spread out like a\ntopographer's map, far below. Don took another wary step, then sat down.\n\n\"Chicken,\" said Alis. She laughed uncertainly, then she sat down, too.\n\n\"I still can't see where the water goes,\" Don said. He stretched out on\nhis stomach and began to inch forward. \"You stay there.\"\n\nFinally he had inched to a point where, by stretching out a hand, he\ncould almost reach the edge. He gave another wriggle and the fingers of\nhis right hand closed over the brink. For a moment he lay there,\npanting, head pressed to the ground.\n\n\"How do you feel?\" Alis asked.\n\n\"Scared. When I get my courage back I'll pick up my head and look.\"\n\nAlis put a hand out tentatively, then purposefully took hold of his\nankle and held it tight. \"Just in case a high wind comes along,\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"Thanks. It helps. Okay, here we go.\" He lifted his head. \"Damn.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"It still isn't clear. Do you have a pocket mirror?\"\n\n\"I have a compact.\" She took it out of her bag with her free hand and\ntossed it to him. It rolled and Don had to grab to keep it from going\nover the edge. Alis gave a little shriek. Don was momentarily unnerved\nand had to put his head back on the ground. \"Sorry,\" she said.\n\nDon opened the compact and carefully transferred it to his right hand.\nHe held it out beyond the edge and peered into it, focusing it on the\nend of the creek. \"Now I've got it. The water _isn't_ going off the\nedge!\"\n\n\"It isn't? Then where is it going?\"\n\n\"Down, of course, but it's as if it's going into a well, or a vertical\ntunnel, just short of the edge.\"\n\n\"Why? How?\"\n\n\"I can't see too well, but that's my impression. Hold on now. I'm coming\nback.\" He inched away from the edge, then got up and brushed himself\noff. He returned her compact. \"I guess you know where we go next.\"\n\n\"The other end of the creek?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\nSouth Creek did not bisect Superior, as Don thought it might, but flowed\nin an arc through a southern segment of it. They had about two miles to\ngo, past South Creek Bridge--which used to lead to Ladenburg, Alis\nsaid--past Raleigh Country Club (a long drive would really put the ball\nout of play, Don thought) and on to the edge again.\n\nBut as they approached what they were forced to consider the source of\nthe creek, they found a wire fence at the spot. \"This is new,\" Alis\nsaid.\n\nThe fence, which had a sign on it, WARNING--ELECTRIFIED, was\nsemicircular, with each end at the edge and tarpaulins strung behind it\nso they could see the mouth of the creek. The water flowed from under\nthe tarp and fence.\n\n\"Look how it comes in spurts,\" Alis said.\n\n\"As if it's being pumped.\"\n\nSmaller print on the sign said: _Protecting mouth of South Creek, one of\ntwo sources of water for Superior. Electrical charge in fence is\nsufficient to kill._ It was signed: _Vincent Grande, Chief of Police,\nHector Civek, Mayor_.\n\n\"What's the other source, besides the faucet in your bathroom?\" Don\nasked.\n\n\"North Lake, maybe,\" Alis said. \"People fish there but nobody's allowed\nto swim.\"\n\n\"Is the lake entirely within the town limits?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"If it were on the edge, and if I took a rowboat out on it, I wonder\nwhat would happen?\"\n\n\"I know one thing--I wouldn't be there holding your ankle while you\nfound out.\"\n\nShe took his arm as they gazed past the electrified fence at the Earth\nbelow and to the west.\n\n\"It's impressive, isn't it?\" she said. \"I wonder if that's Indiana way\nover there?\"\n\nHe patted her hand absent-mindedly. \"I wonder if it's west at all. I\nmean, how do we know Superior is maintaining the same position up here\nas it used to down there?\"\n\n\"We could tell by the sun, silly.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" he said, grinning at his stupidity. \"And I guess we're not\nhigh enough to see very far. If we were we'd be able to see the Great\nLakes--or Lake Erie, anyway.\"\n\nThey were musing about the geography when a plane came out of a\ncloudbank and, a second later, veered sharply. They could make out UAL\non the underside of a wing. As it turned they imagined they could see\nfaces peering out of the windows. They waved and thought they saw one or\ntwo people wave back. Then the plane climbed toward the east and was\ngone.\n\n\"Well,\" Don said as they turned to go back to Cavalier, \"now we know\nthat they know. Maybe we'll begin to get some answers. Or, if not\nanswers, then transportation.\"\n\n\"Transportation?\" Alis squeezed the arm she was holding. \"Why? Don't you\nlike it here?\"\n\n\"If you mean don't I like you, the answer is yes, of course I do. But if\nI don't get out of this handcuff soon so I can take a bath and get into\nclean clothes, you're not going to like me.\"\n\n\"You're still quite acceptable, if a bit whiskery.\" She stopped, still\nholding his arm, and he turned so they were face to face. \"So kiss me,\"\nshe said, \"before you deteriorate.\"\n\nThey were in the midst of an extremely pleasant kiss when the brief case\nat the end of Don's handcuff began to talk to him.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nMuch of the rest of the world was inclined to regard the elevation of\nSuperior, Ohio, as a Fortean phenomenon in the same category as flying\nsaucers and sea monsters.\n\nThe press had a field day. Most of the headlines were whimsical:\n\n     TOWN TAKES OFF\n\n     SUPERIOR LIVES UP TO NAME\n\n     A RISING COMMUNITY\n\nThe city council of Superior, Wisconsin, passed a resolution urging its\nOhio namesake to come back down. The Superiors in Nebraska, Wyoming,\nArizona and West Virginia, glad to have the publicity, added their\nvoices to the plea.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Railroad filed a suit demanding that the state of Ohio\nreturn forthwith one train and five miles of right-of-way.\n\nThe price of bubble gum went up from one cent to three for a nickel.\n\nIn Parliament a Labour member rose to ask the Home Secretary for\nassurances that all British cities were firmly fastened down.\n\nAn Ohio waterworks put in a bid for the sixteen square miles of hole\nthat Superior had left behind, explaining that it would make a fine\nreservoir.\n\nA company that leased out big advertising signs in Times Square offered\nSuperior a quarter of a million dollars for exclusive rights to\nadvertising space on its bottom, or Earthward, side. It sent the offer\nby air mail, leaving delivery up to the post office.\n\nIn Washington, Senator Bobby Thebold ascertained that his red-haired\nsecretary, Jen Jervis, had been aboard the train levitated with Superior\nand registered a series of complaints by telephone, starting with the\nInterstate Commerce Commission and the railroad brotherhoods. He asked\nthe FBI to investigate the possibility of kidnaping and muttered about\nthe likelihood of it all being a Communist plot.\n\nA little-known congressman from Ohio started a rumor that raising of\nSuperior was an experiment connected with the United States earth\nsatellite program. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration\nissued a quick denial.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwo men talked earnestly in an efficient-looking room at the end of one\nof the more intricate mazes in the Pentagon Building. Neither wore a\nuniform but the younger man called the other sir, or chief, or general.\n\n\"We've established definitely that Sergeant Cort was on that train, have\nwe?\" the general asked.\n\n\"Yes, sir. No doubt about it.\"\n\n\"And he has the item with him?\"\n\n\"He must have. The only keys are here and at the other end. He couldn't\nopen the handcuff or the brief case.\"\n\n\"The only _known_ keys, that is.\"\n\n\"Oh? How's that, General?\"\n\n\"The sergeant can open the brief case and use the item if we tell him\nhow.\"\n\n\"You think it's time to use it? I thought we were saving it.\"\n\n\"That was before Superior defected. Now we can use it to more advantage\nthan any theoretical use it might be put to in the foreseeable future.\"\n\n\"We could evacuate Cort. Take him off in a helicopter or drop him a\nparachute and let him jump.\"\n\n\"No. Having him there is a piece of luck. No one knows who he is. We'll\nassign him there for the duration and have him report regularly. Let's\ngo to the message center.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSenator Bobby Thebold was an imposing six feet two, a muscular 195, a\nyouthful-looking 43. He wore his steel-gray hair cut short and his skin\nwas tan the year round. He was a bachelor. He had been a fighter pilot\nin World War II and his conversation was peppered with Air Force slang,\nmuch of it out of date. Thebold was good newspaper copy and one segment\nof the press, admiring his fighting ways, had dubbed him Bobby the Bold.\nThe Senator did not mind a bit.\n\nAt the moment Senator Thebold was pacing the carpet in the ample working\nspace he'd fought to acquire in the Senate Office Building. He was\nmomentarily at a loss. His inquiries about Jen Jervis had elicited no\nsatisfaction from the ICC, the FBI, or the CIA. He was in an\nalphabetical train of thought and went on to consider the CAA, the CAB\nand the CAP. He snapped his fingers at CAP. He had it.\n\nThe Civil Air Patrol itself he considered a la-de-da outfit of gentleman\nflyers, skittering around in light planes, admittedly doing some good,\nbut by and large nothing to excite a former P-38 pilot who'd won a\nchestful of ribbons for action in the Southwest Pacific.\n\nAh, but the PP. There was an organization! Bobby Thebold had been one of\nthe founders of the Private Pilots, a hard-flying outfit that zoomed\ninto the wild blue yonder on week ends and holidays, engines aroar,\npropellers aglint, white silk scarves aflap. PP's members were wealthy\nindustrialists, stunt flyers, sportsmen--the elite of the air.\n\nPP was a paramilitary organization with the rank of its officers\npatterned after the Royal Air Force. Thus Bobby Thebold, by virtue of\nhis war record, his charter membership and his national eminence, was\nWing Commander Thebold, DFC.\n\nWing Commander Thebold swung into action. He barked into the intercom:\n\"Miss Riley! Get the airport. Have them rev up _Charger_. Tell them I'll\nbe there for oh-nine-fifty-eight take-off. Ten-hundred will do. And get\nmy car.\"\n\n_Charger_ was Bobby the Bold's war surplus P-38 Lightning, a sleek,\ntwin-boomed two engine fighter plane restored to its gleaming, paintless\naluminum. Actually it was an unarmed photo-reconnaissance version of the\nfamous war horse of the Pacific, a fact the wing commander preferred to\nignore. In compensation, he belted on a .45 whenever he climbed into the\ncockpit.\n\nThebold got onto Operations in PP's midwestern headquarters in Chicago.\nHe barked, long distance:\n\n\"Jack Perley? Group Captain Perley, that is? Bobby, that's right. Wing\nCommander Thebold now. We've got a mission, Jack. Scramble Blue\nSquadron. What? Of course you can; this is an emergency. We'll\nrendezvous north of Columbus--I'll give you the exact grid in half an\nhour, when I'm airborne. Can do? Good-o! ETA? Eleven-twenty EST. Well,\nmaybe that is optimistic, but I hate to see the day slipping by. Make it\neleven-forty-five. What? Objective? Objective Superior! Got it?\nOkay--roger!\"\n\nWing Commander Bobby Thebold took his Lindbergh-style helmet and goggles\nfrom a desk drawer, caressing the limp leather fondly, and put them in a\ndispatch case. He gave a soft salute to the door behind which Jen Jervis\ncustomarily worked, more as his second-in-command than his secretary,\nand said half aloud:\n\n\"Okay, Jen, we're coming to get you.\"\n\nHe didn't know quite how, but Bobby the Bold and Charger would soon be\non their way.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDon Cort regretfully detached himself from Alis Garet.\n\n\"What was that?\" he said.\n\n\"That was me--Alis the love-starved. You could be a bit more gallant.\nEven 'How was that?,' though corny, would have been preferable.\n\n\"No--I mean I thought I heard a voice. Didn't you hear anything?\"\n\n\"To be perfectly frank--and I say it with some pique--I was totally\nabsorbed. Obviously you weren't.\"\n\n\"It was very nice.\" The countryside, from the edge to the golf course,\nwas deserted.\n\n\"Well, thanks. Thanks a bunch. Such enthusiasm is more than I can bear.\nI have to go now. There's an eleven o'clock class in magnetic flux that\nI'm simply dying to audit.\"\n\nShe gave her shoulder-length blonde hair a toss and started back. Don\nhesitated, looked suspiciously at the brief case dangling from his\nwrist, shook his head, then followed her. The voice, wherever it came\nfrom, had not spoken again.\n\n\"Don't be angry, Alis.\" He fell into step on her left and took her arm\nwith his free hand. \"It's just that everything is so crazy and nobody\nseems to be taking it seriously. A town doesn't just get up and take\noff, and yet nobody up here seems terribly concerned.\"\n\nAlis squeezed the hand that held her arm, mollified. \"You've got\nlipstick on your whiskers.\"\n\n\"Good. I'll never shave again.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" she laughed, \"gallantry at last. I'll tell you what let's do.\nWe'll go see Ed Clark, the editor of the Sentry. Maybe he'll give you\nsome intelligent conversation.\"\n\nThe newspaper office was in a ramshackle one-story building on Lyric\nAvenue, a block off Broadway, Superior's main street. It was in an\nordinary store front whose windows displayed various ancient stand-up\ncardboard posters calling attention to a church supper, a state fair, an\nauto race, and a movie starring H. B. Warner. A dust-covered banner\nurged the election as president of Alfred E. Smith.\n\nThere was no one in the front of the shop. Alis led Don to the rear\nwhere a tall skinny man with straggly gray hair was setting type.\n\n\"Good morning, Mr. Clark,\" she said. \"What's that you're setting--an\nanti-Hoover handbill?\"\n\n\"Hello, Al. How are you this fine altitudinous day?\"\n\n\"Super. Or should it be supra? I want you to meet Don Cort. Don, Mr.\nClark.\"\n\nThe men shook hands and Clark looked curiously at Don's handcuff.\n\n\"It's my theory he's an embezzler,\" Alis said, \"and he's made this his\ngetaway town.\"\n\n\"As a matter of fact,\" Don said, \"the Riggs National Bank will be\nworried if I don't get in touch with them soon. I guess you'd know, Mr.\nClark--is there any communication at all out of town?\" By\nprearrangement, a message from Don to Riggs would be forwarded to\nMilitary Intelligence.\n\n\"I don't know of any, except for the Civek method--a bottle tossed over\nthe edge. The telegraph and telephone lines are cut, of course. There is\na radio station in town, WCAV, operated from the campus, but it's been\nsilent ever since the great severance. At least nothing local has come\nover my old Atwater Kent.\"\n\n\"Isn't anybody _doing_ anything?\" Don asked.\n\n\"Sure,\" Clark said. \"I'm getting out my paper--there was even an extra\nthis morning--and doing job printing. The job is for a jeweler in\nLadenburg. I don't know how I'll deliver it, but no one's told me to\nstop so I'm doing it. I guess everybody's carrying on pretty much as\nbefore.\"\n\n\"That's what I mean. Business as usual. But how about the people who do\nbusiness out of town? What's Western Union doing, for instance? And the\ntrucking companies? And the factories? You have two factories, I\nunderstand, and pretty soon there's going to be a mighty big surplus of\nkitchen sinks and chewing gum.\"\n\n\"You two go on settling our fate,\" Alis said. \"I'd better get back to\nschool. Look me up later, Don.\" She waved and went out.\n\n\"Fine girl, that Alis,\" Clark said. \"Got her old man's gumption without\nhis nutty streak. To answer your question, the Western Union man here is\ncatching up on his bookkeeping and accepting outgoing messages\ncontingent on restoration of service. The sink factory made a shipment\ntwo days ago and won't have another ready till next week, so they're\ncarrying on. They have enough raw material for a month. I was planning\nto visit the bubble gum people this afternoon to see how they're doing.\nMaybe you'd like to come.\"\n\n\"Yes, I would. I still chew it once in a while, on the sly.\"\n\nClark grinned. \"I won't tell. Would you like to tidy up, Don? There's a\nwashroom out back, with a razor and some mysterious running water. Now\n_there's_ a phenomenon I'd like to get to the bottom of.\"\n\n\"Thanks. I'll shave with it now and worry about its source later. Do you\nthink Professor Garet and his magnology cult has anything to do with\nit?\"\n\n\"He'd like to think so, I'm sure.\" Clark shrugged. \"We've been airborne\nless than twelve hours. I guess the answers will come in time. You go\nclean up and I'll get back to my job.\"\n\nDon felt better when he had shaved. It had been awkward because he\nhadn't been able to take off his coat or shirt, but he'd managed. He was\ndrying his face when the voice came again. This time there was no doubt\nit came from the brief case chained to his handcuff.\n\n\"Are you alone now?\" it asked.\n\nStartled, Don said, \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Good. Speak closer to the brief case so we won't be overheard. This is\nCaptain Simmons, Sergeant.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Take out your ID card. Separate the two pieces of plastic. There's a\nflat plastic key next to the card. Open the brief case lock with it.\"\n\nThe voice was silent until Don, with the help of a razor blade, had done\nas he was directed. \"All right, sir; that's done.\"\n\n\"Open the brief case, take out the package, open the package and put the\nwrappings back in the brief case.\"\n\nAgain the voice stopped. Don unwrapped something that looked like a flat\ncigarette case with two appendages, one a disk of perforated hard rubber\nthe size of a half dollar, and the other a three-quarter-inch-wide\nribbon of opaque plastic. \"I've got it, sir.\"\n\n\"Good. What you see is a highly advanced radio transmitter and receiver.\nYou can imagine its value in the field. It's a pilot model you were\nbringing back from the contractor for tests here. But this seems as\nuseful a way to test it as any other.\"\n\n\"It's range is fantastic, Captain--if you're in Washington.\"\n\n\"I am. Now. The key also unlocks the handcuff. Unlock it. Strip to the\nwaist. Bend the plastic strip to fit over your shoulder--either one, as\nyou choose. Arrange the perforated disk so it's at the base of your\nneck, under your shirt collar. The thing that looks like a cigarette\ncase is the power pack.\"\n\nDon followed the instructions, rubbing his wrist in relief as the\nhandcuff came off. The radio had been well designed and its components\nwent into place as if they had been built to his measure. They tickled a\nlittle on his bare skin, that was all. The power pack was surprisingly\nlight.\n\n\"That's done, sir,\" Don said.\n\nThe answer came softly. \"So I hear. You almost blasted my ear off. From\nnow on, when you speak to me, or whoever's at this end, a barely audible\nmurmur will be sufficient. Try it.\"\n\n\"Yes, Captain,\" Don whispered. \"I'm trying it now.\"\n\n\"Don't whisper. I can hear you all right, but so could people you\nwouldn't want overhearing at your end. A whisper carries farther than\nyou think. Talk low.\"\n\nDon practiced while he put his shirt, tie and coat back on.\n\n\"Good,\" Captain Simmons said. \"Practice talking without moving your\nlips, for occasions when you might have to transmit to us in someone's\nview. Now put your handcuff back on and lock it.\"\n\n\"Oh, damn,\" Don said under his breath.\n\n\"I heard that.\"\n\n\"Sorry, sir, but it is a nuisance.\"\n\n\"I know, but you have to get rid of it logically. When you get a chance\ngo to the local bank. It's the Superior State Bank on McEntee Street.\nShow them your credentials from Riggs National and ask them to keep your\nbrief case in their vault. Get a receipt. Then, at your first\nopportunity, burn the plastic key and your ID card.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Keep up your masquerade as a bank messenger and try to find out, as if\nyou were an ordinary curiosity-seeker, all you can about Cavalier\nInstitute. You've made a good start with the Garet girl. Get to know her\nfather, the professor.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" Don realized with embarrassment that his little romantic\ninterlude with Alis must have been eavesdropped on. \"Are there any\nparticular times I'm to report?\"\n\n\"You will be reporting constantly. That's the beauty of this radio.\"\n\n\"You mean I can't turn it off? I won't have any privacy? There'll always\nbe somebody listening?\"\n\n\"Exactly. But you mustn't be inhibited. Your private life is still your\nown and no one will criticize. Your unofficial actions will simply be\nignored.\"\n\n\"Oh, great!\"\n\n\"You must rely on our discretion, Sergeant. I'm sure you'll get used to\nit. Enough of this for now. We mustn't excite Clark's suspicions. Go\nback to him now and carry on. You'll receive further instructions as\nthey are necessary. And remember--don't be inhibited.\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" Don said ruefully. He went back to the printshop, feeling\nlike a goldfish bowl.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nEd Clark took Don to the Superior State Bank and introduced him to the\npresident, who was delighted to do business with a representative of\nRiggs National of Washington, D. C. Don told him nothing about the\ncontents of the brief case, but the banker seemed to be under the\nimpression they were securities or maybe even a million dollars cash,\nand Don said nothing to spoil his pleasure.\n\nOutside again, with the receipt in his wallet, Don stood with Clark on\nthe corner of McEntee Street and Broadway.\n\n\"This is the heart of town, you might say,\" the newspaper editor said.\n\"The bubble gum factory is over that way, on the railroad spur. Maybe\nyou can smell it. Smells real nice, I think.\"\n\nDon rubbed the wrist that had been manacled for so long. He was sniffing\npolitely when there was a roar of engines and a squadron of fighter\nplanes buzzed Broadway.\n\nThey screamed over at little more than roof level, then were gone. They\nwere overhead so briefly that Don noticed only that they were P-38's, at\nleast four of them.\n\n\"Things are beginning to happen,\" Don said. \"The Air Force is having a\nlook-see.\"\n\nClark shook his head. \"That wasn't the Air Force. Those were the PP\nboys. They're the only ones who fly those Lightnings these days.\"\n\n\"PP?\"\n\n\"Private Pilots. Bobby the Bold's airborne vigilantes. Wonder what\nthey're up to?\"\n\n\"Oh. Senator Bobby Thebold, S.O.B.\"\n\n\"If you want to put it that way, yes.\"\n\n\"It's a private joke. But I think I know what they're up to--or why. The\nSenator's secretary is marooned up here, like me. She was on the train,\ntoo.\"\n\n\"You don't say! I got scooped on that one. Which one is she?\"\n\n\"The redhead. Geneva Jervis. I haven't seen her since last night, come\nto think of it.\"\n\nThe P-38's screamed over again, this time from west to east. Don counted\nsix planes now and made out the PP markings. People had come out of\nstores and business buildings and were looking out of upstairs windows\nat the sky. They were rewarded by a third thundering flypast of the\nfighter planes. They were higher this time, spread out laterally as if\nto search maximum terrain.\n\n\"Big deal,\" Clark said. \"This show would bring anyone outdoors, but even\nif they see her what do you suppose they can do about it? There's no\nplace in town flat enough for a Piper Cub to land, let alone a fighter\nplane.\"\n\n\"How about the golf course?\"\n\n\"Raleigh? Worst set of links in the whole United States. A helicopter\ncould put down there, but that's about all. What's old Bobby so worked\nup about, I wonder? Unless there's something to that gossip about this\nJervis girl being his mistress and he's showing off for her.\"\n\n\"He'd show off for anybody, they tell me,\" Don said. Then he remembered\nthat Military Intelligence was listening in. If any pro-Thebold people\nwere among his eavesdroppers, he hoped they respected his private right\nto be anti-Thebold.\n\nAt that moment he and Clark were thrown against the side of the bank\nbuilding. They clung to each other and Don noticed that the sun had\nmoved a few degrees in the sky.\n\n\"Oh-oh,\" Clark grunted. \"Superior's taking evasive action. Thinks it's\nbeing attacked.\" As they regained their footing he asked, \"Do you feel\nheavy in the legs?\"\n\n\"Yes. As if I were going up in an express elevator.\"\n\n\"Exactly. Somebody's getting us up beyond the reach of these pesky\nplanes, I'd guess.\"\n\nThe P-38's were overhead again, but now they seemed to be diving on the\ntown. More likely, if Clark's theory was right, it was an illusion--the\nplanes were flying level but the town was rising fast.\n\n\"They'd better climb,\" Don said, \"or they'll crash!\"\n\nThere was the sound of a crash almost immediately, from the south end of\ntown. Don and Clark ran toward it, fighting the heaviness in their legs.\n\nA dozen others were ahead of them, running sluggishly across South Creek\nBridge. Beyond, just short of the edge, was the wreckage of a fighter\nplane and, behind it, the torn-up ground of a crash landing. There was\nno fire.\n\nThe pilot struggled out of the cockpit. He dropped to the ground, felt\nhimself to see if any bones were broken, then saw the crowd running\ntoward him.\n\nThe pilot hesitated, then ran toward the edge. Shouts came from the\ncrowd. With a last glance over his shoulder, the pilot leaped and went\nover the edge.\n\nThe crowd, Don and Clark among them, approached more cautiously. They\nmade out a falling dot and, a second later, saw a parachute blossom\nopen. The other planes appeared and flew a wide protective circle around\nthe chutist.\n\n\"Do you think that's Bobby Thebold?\" Don asked.\n\n\"Probably not. That was the last plane in the formation. Thebold would\nbe the leader.\"\n\nThey went back past the crashed plane, surrounded by a growing crowd\nfrom town, and recrossed the bridge.\n\n\"Look at the water,\" the editor said. \"Ice is forming.\"\n\n\"And we're still rising,\" Don said, \"if my legs are any judge. Do you\nthink there's a connection?\"\n\nClark shrugged. He turned up his coat collar and rubbed his hands. \"All\nI know is the higher we go the colder we get. Come on back to the shop\nand warm up.\"\n\nThey turned at the sound of engines. Two of the five remaining P-38's\nhad detached themselves from their cover of the chutist and were flying\naround the rim of Superior--as if unwilling to risk another flight\nacross the surface of the town that seemed determined to become a\nsatellite of Earth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Don Cort reached the campus he was shivering, in spite of the\nsweater and topcoat Ed Clark had lent him. He asked a student where the\nAdministration Building was and at the desk inquired for Professor\nGaret.\n\nA gray-haired, dedicated-looking woman told him impatiently that\nProfessor Garet was in his laboratory and couldn't be disturbed. She\nwouldn't tell him where the laboratory was.\n\n\"Have you seen Miss Jervis?\" Don wondered whether the redhead\nappreciated the demonstration her boss, the flying Senator, had put on\nfor her.\n\nThe woman behind the desk shook her head. \"You're two of the people from\nthe train, aren't you? Well, you're all supposed to report to the dining\nroom at two o'clock.\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"You'll find out at two o'clock.\"\n\nIt was obvious he would get no more information from her. Don left the\nbuilding. It was half-past one. He crossed the near-deserted campus. His\nlegs still felt heavy and he assumed Superior was still rising. It\ncertainly seemed to be getting increasingly colder.\n\nHe wondered how high they were and whether it would snow. He hoped not.\nHow high did you have to be before you got up where it didn't snow any\nmore? He had no idea. He did recall that Mount Everest was 29,000 feet\nup and that it snowed up there. Or would it be _down_ there, relatively\nspeaking? How high could they be, and didn't anybody care?\n\nThe frosty old receptionist seemed to be typical in her\nbusiness-as-usual, come-what-may attitude. Even Ed Clark didn't seem as\nconcerned as he ought to be about Superior's ascent into the\nstratosphere. Clark was interested, certainly, but he'd given Don the\nimpression that he was no more curious than he would be about any other\nphenomenon he'd write about in next week's paper--a two-headed calf, for\ninstance.\n\nDon remembered now that the conquerors of Everest had needed oxygen in\nthe rarefied atmosphere near the summit and he experimentally took a\ncouple of deep breaths. No difficulty. Therefore they weren't 29,000\nfeet up--yet. Small comfort, he thought, as he shivered again.\n\nHe picked out a building at random. Classes were in session behind the\nclosed but windowed doors along the hall. From the third door he saw\nAlis Garet, sitting at the back of a small classroom. Her attention had\nwandered from the instructor and when she saw Don she smiled and\nbeckoned. He hesitated, then opened the door and went in as quietly as\nhe could. The instructor paused briefly, nodded, then went back to a\ndroning lecture. It seemed to be an English literature class.\n\nAlis cleared some books off a chair next to her and Don sat down. \"Who\nturned you loose?\" she whispered.\n\nHe realized she was referring to his de-handcuffed wrist and grinned,\nindicating that he'd tell her later.\n\n\"I see you've been outfitted for our new climate,\" she went on. A\nstudent in the row of chairs ahead turned and frowned. The instructor\ntalked on, oblivious.\n\nDon nodded and said \"_Sh_.\"\n\n\"Don't let them intimidate you. Did you see the planes?\"\n\nMore students were turning and glaring and Don's embarrassment grew.\n\"Come on,\" he said. \"Let's cut this class.\"\n\n\"Bravo!\" she said. \"Spoken like a true Cavalier.\"\n\nShe gathered up her books. The instructor, without interrupting his\nlecture, followed them with his eyes as they left the room.\n\n\"Now I'll never know whether the young princes got out of the tower\nalive,\" she said.\n\n\"They didn't. The question is, will we?\"\n\n\"I certainly hope so. I'll have to speak to Father about it.\"\n\n\"He's locked up in his lab, they tell me. Where would that be?\"\n\n\"In the tower, as a matter of fact. The bell tower that the founding\nfathers built and then didn't have enough money to buy bells for. But\nyou can't go up there--it's the holy of holies.\"\n\n\"Can you?\"\n\n\"No. Why? You don't think Father is making all this happen, do you?\"\n\n\"Somebody is. Professor Garet seems as good a suspect as any.\"\n\n\"Oh, he likes to act mysterious, but it's all an act. Poor old Father is\njust a crackpot theorist. I told you that. He couldn't pick up steel\nfiling with a magnet.\"\n\n\"I wonder. Look, somebody's called a meeting for us outsiders from the\ntrain at two o'clock. It's almost that now. Maybe I'll have a chance to\nask some questions. Will your father be there?\"\n\n\"I'm sure he will. He's a great meeting-caller. I'll go with you. And,\nsince you have two free hands now, you can hold my books. Maybe later\nyou'll get a chance to hold me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAmong the people sitting around the bare tables in the dining room, Don\nrecognized the conductor and other trainmen, two stocky individuals who\nhad the look of traveling salesmen, an elderly couple who held hands, a\nyoung couple with a baby, two nuns, a soldier apparently going on or\nreturning from furlough, and a tall, hawk-nosed man Don classified on no\nevidence at all as a Shakespearean actor. All had been on the train. He\ndidn't see Geneva Jervis anywhere.\n\nAn improvised speaker's table had been set up at one end of the room,\nnear the door to the kitchen. A heavy-set man sat at the table talking\nto Mrs. Garet, the professor's wife.\n\n\"The stoutish gentleman next to Mother is the president of Cavalier,\"\nAlis said. \"Maynard Rubach. When you talk to him be sure to call him\n_Doctor_ Rubach. He's not a Ph.D. and he's sensitive about it, but he\ndid used to be a veterinarian.\"\n\nThey sat down near the big table and Mrs. Garet smiled and waved at\nthem. Mayor Civek came in through the kitchen door, licking a finger as\nif he'd been sampling something on the way, and sat down next to Mrs.\nGaret.\n\nAt that moment Don's stomach gave a hop and he felt blood rushing to his\nhead. Others also had pained or nauseous expressions.\n\n\"Ugh,\" Alis said. \"Now what?\"\n\n\"I'd guess,\" Don said when his stomach had settled back in place, \"that\nwe've stopped rising.\"\n\n\"You mean we've gone as high as we're going to go?\"\n\n\"I hope so. We'd run out of air if we went much higher.\"\n\nProfessor Garet came in presently, looking pleased with himself. He\nnodded to his wife and the men next to her and cleared his throat as he\nlooked out over the room.\n\n\"Altitude 21,500 feet,\" he announced without preamble. \"Temperature\nsixteen degrees Fahrenheit. From here on out--\" he paused, repeated\n\"out\" and chuckled--\"it's going to be a bit chilly. Those of you who are\ninadequately clothed will see my wife for extra garments. I believe you\nhave been comfortably housed and fed. There will, of course, be no\ncharge for these services while you are the guests of the Cavalier\nInstitute of Applied Sciences. Thank you. I now present Mr. Hector\nCivek, the mayor of Superior, who will answer any other questions you\nmay have.\"\n\nDon looked at Alis, who shrugged. The conductor stood and opened a\nnotebook which he consulted. \"I have a few questions, Mr. Mayor. These\npeople have asked me to speak for them and there's one question that\noutweighs all the others. That is--are you going to take us back to\nEarth? If so, when? And how?\"\n\nCivek cleared his throat. He took a sip of water. \"As for the first\nquestion--we certainly hope to take you and ourselves back to Earth. I\ncan't answer the others.\"\n\n\"You hope to?\"\n\n\"Earnestly. I turn blue easily myself, and I'm as anxious as you are to\nget back. But when that will be depends entirely on circumstances.\nCircumstances, uh, beyond my control.\"\n\n\"Who's controlling them, then? Your friend with the whiskers?\"\n\nProfessor Garet smiled amiably and patted his beard. The portly Maynard\nRubach got up and Civek sat down.\n\n\"I am Dr. Maynard Rubach, president of Cavalier. I must insist that in\ncommon decency we all refrain from personal references. Mr. Civek has\ndone his best to give you an explanation, but of course he is a layman\nand, while he has many excellent qualities, we cannot expect him to be\nconversant with the principles of science. I will therefore attempt to\nexplain.\n\n\"As you know, science has been aware for hundreds of years that the\nEarth is a giant magnet....\"\n\nDon saw Geneva Jervis. She was at the kitchen door beyond the speaker's\ntable.\n\n\"... the isogenic and the isoclinic ...\"\n\nThe red-haired Miss Jervis saw Don now and put her finger to her lips.\n\n\"... an ultimote, which is simultaneously an integral part of ...\"\n\nNow the redhead was beckoning to him urgently. He excused himself to\nAlis, who frowned when she saw the other girl; then he went back of the\nspeaker's table (\"... 1,257 tenescopes to the square centimeter ...\")\ninto the kitchen. Jen Jervis was by now at the far end of it, motioning\nhim to hurry up.\n\n\"I've found something,\" she said. She was wearing a shapeless fur coat,\napparently borrowed.\n\n\"Come on. You'll have to see it.\"\n\n\"All right, but why me?\"\n\n\"Aside from myself you seem to be the only one from the train with any\ngumption. I know you've been spying around doing things while everybody\nelse sat back and waited for deliverance. Though I can't say I admire\nyour choice of companions. That tawdry blonde--\"\n\n\"Now, really, Miss Jervis!\"\n\n\"Tawny, then; sometimes I mix up my words.\"\n\n\"I'll bet.\"\n\nShe led him out the back door and across the frozen ground past several\nbuildings. They reached what once must have been an athletic field.\n\n\"At the far end,\" she said. \"Come on.\"\n\n\"Where were you when your boy friend and his daredevil aces came over?\"\n\n\"I saw them.\"\n\n\"Did they see you?\"\n\n\"None of your business.\"\n\nHe shrugged. They were at a section of the grandstand at the end of the\nfield. Jen Jervis indicated a door and Don opened it. It led to a big\nroom under the stands. \"What does this remind you of?\" she asked.\n\nDon looked blank. In the dim light he could see some planking, a\nlong-deflated football, ancient peanut shells and an empty pint bottle.\n\"I don't know. What?\"\n\n\"Stagg Field? At the University of Chicago? Under the stands where they\nfirst made an atomic pile work?\" She looked at him with the air of an\ninvestigator hot on the scent.\n\nHe shrugged. \"Never been there. So what?\"\n\n\"It's a pattern. This is where they've hidden their secret.\"\n\n\"It looks more like the place a co-ed and her boy friend might go to\nhave a little fun. In warmer weather, of course.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" she said. \"You're disgusting! Look over there.\"\n\nHe looked, wondering what made this young attractive woman\nhypersensitive on the subject of sex. This was the second time she'd\nblazed up over nothing. What he saw where she pointed was a door at a\n45-degree angle to the ground, set into a triangular block of concrete.\n\"Where does that go?\" he asked.\n\n\"Down,\" she said as they walked toward it. \"And there's some machinery\nor something down there. I heard it. Or maybe I only felt the\nvibrations. It throbs, anyway.\"\n\n\"Probably the generator for the school's lighting system. Did you go\ndown and look?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"All right, then.\" He opened the door. \"Down we go.\"\n\nAt the bottom of a flight of steps there was a corridor lit by dim\nelectric light bulbs along one wall. The corridor became a tunnel,\nsloping gradually downward. They had been going north, Don judged, but\nthen the tunnel made a right turn and now they were following it due\neast. \"I don't hear any throbbing,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, I did, and from way up here. They must have turned it off.\"\n\n\"How long ago was that?\"\n\n\"An hour, maybe.\"\n\n\"While we were still rising. That would make sense. We've stopped again,\nyou know. Professor Garet gave us a bulletin on it.\"\n\nHe had been going ahead of her in the narrow tunnel. Now it widened and\nthey were able to walk side by side. There seemed to be no end to it.\nBut then they came to a sturdy-looking door, padlocked.\n\n\"That's that,\" Don said.\n\n\"That's that nothing,\" she said. \"Break it down.\"\n\nHe laughed. \"You flatter me. Come on back.\"\n\n\"Don't you think this is at all peculiar? A tunnel starting under an\nabandoned grandstand, running all this way and ending in a locked door?\"\n\n\"Maybe this was a station on the underground railway. It looks old\nenough.\"\n\n\"We're going through that door.\" She opened her purse and took out a key\nring. On it was an extensive collection of keys. Eventually she found\none that opened the padlock.\n\n\"Well!\" he said. \"Who taught you _that_?\"\n\n\"Open the door.\"\n\nThe corridor beyond the door was lined--walls, ceiling and floor--with a\nsilvery metal. It continued east a hundred yards or so, swung north and\nthen went east again, widening all the time.\n\nIt ended in a great room whose far wall was glass or some equally\ntransparent substance. The room was a huge observatory at the end of\nSuperior but below its rim. They could look down from it, not without a\ntouch of nausea, to the Earth four miles below.\n\nDon, thinking of the surface of Superior above, thought it was as if\nthey were looking out of the gondola slung beneath a dirigible.\n\nOr from one of the lower portholes in a giant flying saucer.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nThere were clouds below that occasionally hid the Earth from sight. For\na minute or more they gazed in silence at the magnificent view.\n\n\"This wasn't built in a day,\" Jen Jervis said at last.\n\n\"I should say not,\" Don agreed. \"Millions of years.\"\n\nShe looked at him sharply. \"I wasn't talking about the age of the Earth.\nI mean this room--this lookout post--whatever it is.\"\n\nHe grinned at her. \"I agree with you there, too. I'm really a very\nagreeable fellow, Miss Jervis. Obviously, whoever built it knew well in\nadvance that Superior was going to take off. They also knew how much of\nit was going up and exactly where this would have to be built so it\nwould be at the edge.\"\n\n\"Under the edge, you mean, with a downward view.\"\n\n\"That's right. From a distance I'd say Superior looked as if someone had\ncut the end off an orange. The flat part--where the cut was made--is the\nsurface and we're looking out from a piece of the convex skin.\"\n\n\"You put things so simply, Mr. Cort, that even a child could\nunderstand,\" she said acidly.\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said complacently. He had remembered that whoever was\nlistening in for Military Intelligence through the tiny radio under his\nshirt could have only a vague idea of what was going on. Any little word\npictures he could supply, therefore, would help them understand. He had\nto risk the fact that his companion might think him a bit of an idiot.\n\nOf course with this Geneva Jervis it was easy to lay himself open to the\nscathing comment and the barbed retort. He imagined she was extremely\nuseful in her role as Girl Friday to Senator Bobby Thebold.\n\n\"I don't think this is the work of those boobies at the booby hatch,\"\nshe was saying.\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\"\n\n\"The Cavalier Institution of Applied Foolishness, whatever they call it.\nThey just wouldn't be capable of an undertaking of this scope.\"\n\n\"Oh, I agree. That's why I let you drag me away from the meeting. It was\na lot of pseudo-scientific malarkey. Old Doc Rubach, D.V.M., was going\non about the ultimote being connected to the thighbone, way up in the\nmiddle of the air. Tell me, who do _you_ think is behind it all?\"\n\nShe was walking around the big-sided room as if taking mental inventory.\nThere wasn't much to catalogue--six straight chairs, heavy and\nmodern-looking, with a large wooden table, a framed piece of dark glass\nthat might be a television set, and a gray steel box about the size and\nshape of a three-drawer filing cabinet. This last was near the big\nwindow-wall and had three black buttons on its otherwise smooth top. Don\nitched to push the buttons to see what would happen. Jen Jervis seemed\nto have the same urge. She drummed on the box with her long fingernails.\n\n\"I?\" she said. \"Behind it all?\"\n\n\"Yes. What's your theory? Is this something for the Un-Earthly\nActivities Committee to investigate?\"\n\n\"Don't be impertinent. If the Senator thinks it's his duty to look into\nit, he will. He undoubtedly is already. In the meantime, I can do no\nless than gather whatever information I can while I'm on the scene.\"\n\n\"Very patriotic. What do you conclude from your information-gathering so\nfar?\"\n\n\"Obviously there's some kind of conspiracy--\" she began, then stopped as\nif she suspected a trap.\n\n\"--afoot,\" Don said with a grin. \"As I see it, all you do is have Bobby\nthe Bold subpoena everybody up here--every last man-jack of 'em--to\ntestify before his committee. They wouldn't dare refuse.\"\n\n\"I don't find you a bit amusing, Mr. Cort, though I have no doubt this\nsophomoric humor makes a big hit with your teen-age blonde. We'd better\nget back. I can see it was a mistake to expect any co-operation from\nyou.\"\n\n\"As you like, Madame Investigator.\" Don gave her a mock bow, then turned\nfor a last look down at the vast segment of Earth below.\n\nGeneva Jervis screamed.\n\nHe whirled to see her standing, big-eyed and open-mouthed, in front of\nthe framed dark glass he had taken for a television screen. Her face was\ncontorted in horror, and as Don's gaze flicked to the screen he had the\nbarest glimpse of a pair of eyes fading with a dissolving image. Then\nthe screen was blank and Don wasn't sure whether there had been a face\nto go with the eyes--an inhuman, un-earthly face--or whether his\nimagination had supplied it.\n\nThe girl slumped to the floor in a faint.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_COLUMBUS, OHIO, Nov. 1 (AP)--Sen. Robert (Bobby) Thebold landed here\ntoday after leading his Private Pilots (PP) squadron of P-38's on a\nreconnaissance flight which resulted in the loss of one of the six World\nWar II fighters in a crash landing on the mysteriously airborne town of\nSuperior, Ohio. The pilot of the crashed plane parachuted safely to\nEarth._\n\n_Sen. Thebold told reporters grimly:_\n\n_\"There is no doubt in my mind that mysterious forces are at work when a\ntown of 3,000 population can rise in a body off the face of the Earth.\nMy reconnaissance has shown conclusively that the town is intact and its\ninhabitants alive.

Thebold said he was confident Miss Jervis would contact him the\nmoment she had anything to report, indicating she would make an\non-the-spot investigation._\n\n_The Senator said in reply to a question that he was \"amazed\" at\nofficial Washington's \"complete inaction\" in the matter, and declared he\nwould demand a probe by the Senate Investigations Subcommittee, of which\nhe is a member. He indicated witnesses might include officials of the\nDefense Department, the Central Intelligence Agency, and \"possibly\nothers.\"_\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_LADENBURG, Ohio, Nov. 1 (UPI)--Little Ladenburg, former neighbor of\n\"The City in the Sky,\" complained today of a rain of empty beer cans and\nother rubbish, apparently being tossed over the edge by residents of\nairborne Superior._\n\n_\"They're not so high and mighty,\" one sanitation official here said,\n\"that they can make Ladenburg their garbage dump.\"_\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_WASHINGTON, Nov. 1 (Reuters)--American officials today were at a loss\nto explain the strange behaviour of Superior, Ohio, \"the town that took\noff.\"_\n\n_Authoritative sources assured Reuters that no military or scientific\nexperiments were in progress which could account for the phenomenon of a\ntown being lifted intact thousands of feet into the air._\n\n_Rumors circulating to the effect that a \"Communist plot\" was at work\nwere greeted with extreme scepticism in official quarters._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBULLETIN\n\n_COLUMBUS, Ohio, Nov. 1 (UPI)--The airborne town of Superior began to\ndrift east across Ohio late today._\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nThe unconscious Geneva Jervis, lying crumpled up in the oversized fur\ncoat, was the immediate problem. Don Cort straightened her out so she\nlay on her back, took off her shoes and propped her ankles on the lower\nrung of a chair. He found she was wearing a belt and loosened it. It was\nobvious that she was also wearing a girdle but there wasn't anything he\nwanted to do about that. He was rubbing one of her wrists when her eyes\nfluttered open.\n\nShe smiled self-consciously. \"I guess I was a sissy.\"\n\n\"Not at all. I saw it, too. A pair of eyes.\"\n\n\"And a face! A horrible, horrible face.\"\n\n\"I wasn't sure about the face. Can you describe it?\"\n\nShe darted a tentative look at the screen but it was comfortingly blank.\n\"It wasn't human. And it was staring right into me. It was awful!\"\n\n\"Did it have a nose, ears, mouth?\"\n\n\"I--I can't be sure. Let's get out of here. I'm all right now. Thanks\nfor being so good to me--Don.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it--Jen. Here, put your shoes on.\"\n\nWhen he had closed the big wooden door behind them, Don padlocked it\nagain. He preferred to leave things as they'd found them, even though\ntheir visit to the observation room was no longer a secret.\n\nHe was relieved when they had scrambled up the steps under the\ngrandstand. There had been no sense of anyone or anything following them\nor spying on them during their long walk through the tunnel.\n\nThey were silent with their separate thoughts as they crossed the frosty\nground and Jen held Don's arm, more for companionship than support. At\nthe campus the girl excused herself, saying she still felt shaky and\nwanted to rest in her room. Don went back to the dining room.\n\nThe meeting was over but Alis Garet was there, having a cup of tea and\nreading a book.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" she said, giving him an intent look, \"how was the\nrendezvous?\"\n\n\"Fair to middling.\" He was relieved to see that she wasn't angry. \"Did\nanybody say anything while I was gone?\"\n\n\"Not a coherent word. You don't deserve it but I made notes for you.\nRunning off with that redhead when you have a perfectly adequate blonde.\nDid you kiss her?\"\n\n\"Of course not. It was strictly business. Let me see the notes, you\nangel.\"\n\n\"Notes, then.\" She handed over a wad of paper.\n\n\"Rubach,\" he read, \"Magnology stuff stuff stuff etc. etc. Nothing.\n\n\"Q.

I see I didn't\nmiss much. The only thing it seems to add is that Mayor Civek is a\nfigurehead, and that if the Cavalier people know anything they're not\ntalking, except in gobbledygook.\"\n\n\"Check,\" Alis said. \"Now let's go take a look at Pittsburgh.\"\n\n\"Pittsburgh?\"\n\n\"That's where we are now. One of the students who lives there peeped\nover the edge a while ago. I was waiting for you to come back before I\nwent to have a look.\"\n\n\"Pittsburgh?\" Don repeated. \"You mean Superior's drifting across the\nUnited States?\"\n\n\"Either that or it's being pushed. Let's go see.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere hadn't been much to see and it had been too cold to watch for\nlong. The lights of Pittsburgh were beginning to go on in the dusk and\nthe city looked pretty and far away. A Pennsylvania Air National Guard\nplane came up to investigate, but from a respectful distance. Then it\nflew off.\n\nDon left Alis, shivering, at her door and decided he wanted a drink. He\nremembered having seen a sign, _Club Lyric_, down the street from the\n_Sentry_ office and he headed for it.\n\n\"Sergeant Cort,\" said a muffled voice under his collar.\n\nDon jumped. He'd forgotten for the moment that he was a walking radio\nstation. \"Yes?\" he said.\n\n\"Reception has been excellent,\" the voice said. It was no longer that of\nCaptain Simmons. \"You needn't recapitulate. We've heard all your\nconversations and feel we know as much as you do. You'll have to admit\nit isn't much.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid not. What do you want me to do now? Should I go back and\ninvestigate that underground room again? That seems to be the best lead\nso far.\"\n\n\"No. You're just a bank messenger whose biggest concern was to safeguard\nthe contents of the brief case. Now that the contents are presumably in\nthe bank vault your official worries are over, and though you're curious\nto know why Superior's acting the way it is, you're willing to let\nsomebody else do something about it.\"\n\n\"But they saw me in the room. Those eyes, whatever they are. I had the\nfeeling--well, that they weren't human.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" the voice from the Pentagon said. \"An ordinary\nclosed-circuit television hookup. Don't let your imagination run away\nwith you, and above all don't play spy. If they're suspicious of anyone\nit will be of Geneva Jervis because of her connection with Senator\nThebold. Where are you going now?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, I thought--that is, if there's no objection--I thought I'd\ngo have a drink. See what the townspeople are saying.\"\n\n\"Good idea. Do that.\"\n\n\"What are they saying in Washington? Does anybody put any stock in this\nmagnology stuff of Professor Garet's?\"\n\n\"Facts are being collated. There's been no evaluation yet. You'll hear\nfrom us again when there's something to tell you. For now, Cort, carry\non. You're doing a splendid job.\"\n\nThe streets were cold, dark, and deserted. The few street lights were\nfeeble and the lights in houses and other buildings seemed dimmer than\nnormal. A biting wind had sprung up and Don was glad when he saw the\nneon words _Club Lyric_ ahead.\n\nThe bartender greeted him cheerfully. \"It ain't a fit night. What'll it\nbe?\"\n\nDon decided on a straight shot, to start. \"What's going on?\" he asked.\n\"Where's the old town going?\"\n\nThe bartender shrugged. \"Let Civek worry about that. It's what we pay\nhim for, ain't it?\"\n\n\"I suppose so. How're you fixed for liquor? Big supply?\"\n\n\"Last a coupla weeks unless people start drinking more than usual.\nBeer'll run out first.\"\n\n\"That's right, I guess. But aren't you worried about being up in the air\nlike this?\"\n\nThe bartender shrugged again. \"Not much I can do about it, is there?\nWant another shot?\"\n\n\"Mix it this time. A little soda. Is that the general attitude? Business\nas usual?\"\n\n\"I hear some business is picking up. Lot of people buying winter\nclothes, for one thing, weather turning cold the way it did. And Dabney\nBrothers--they run the coal and fuel oil company--got enough orders to\nkeep them going night and day for a week.\"\n\n\"That's fine. But when they eventually run out, like you, then what?\nEverybody freeze to death?\"\n\nThe bartender made a thoughtful face. \"You got something there. Oh,\nhello, Ed. Kinda brisk tonight.\"\n\nIt was Ed Clark, the newspaperman. Clark nodded to the bartender, who\nbegan to mix him a martini. \"Freeze the ears off a brass monkey,\" Clark\nsaid, joining Don. \"I have an extra pair of earmuffs if you'd like\nthem.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Don said, \"but I think I'd better buy myself some winter\nclothes tomorrow and return yours.\"\n\n\"Suit yourself. Planning to settle down here?\"\n\n\"I don't seem to have much choice. Anything new at your end?\"\n\nClark lifted his brimming glass and took a sip. \"Here's to a mild\nwinter. New? I guess you know we're in Pennsylvania now and not Ohio.\n_Over_ Pennsylvania, I should say. Don't ask me why, unless Hector Civek\nthinks Superior will get a better break, taxwise.\"\n\n\"You think the mayor's behind it all?\"\n\n\"He has his delusions of grandeur, like a lot of people here. But I do\nthink Hector knows more than he's telling. Some of the merchants--mostly\nthose whose business hasn't benefited by the cold wave--have called a\nmeeting for tomorrow. They want to pump him.\"\n\n\"He wasn't exactly a flowing spout at Cavalier this afternoon when the\npeople from the train wanted answers.\"\n\n\"So that's where he was. They couldn't find him at Town Hall.\"\n\n\"Where's it all going to end? If we keep on drifting we'll be over the\nAtlantic--next stop Europe. Then Superior will be crossing national\nboundaries instead of just state lines, and some country may decide\nwe're violating its air space and shoot us out of the sky.\"\n\n\"I see you take the long view,\" Clark said.\n\n\"Is there any other?\" Don asked. \"The alternative is to kid ourselves\nthat everything's all right and trust in Providence and Hector Civek.\nWhat is it with you people? You don't seem to realize that sixteen\nsquare miles of solid earth, and three thousand people, have taken off\nto go waltzing through the sky. That isn't just something that happens.\nSomething or somebody's making it happen. The question is who or what,\nand what are you going to do about it?\"\n\nThe bartender said, \"The boy's right, Ed. How do we know they won't take\nus up higher--up where there's no air? Then we'd be cooked.\"\n\nClark laughed. \"'Cooked' is hardly the word. But I agree that things are\ngetting out of hand.\" He set down his glass with a clink. \"I know the\nman we want. Old Doc Bendy. He could stir things up. Remember the time\nthey tried to run the pipeline through town and Doc formed a citizens\ncommittee and stopped them?\"\n\n\"Stopped them dead,\" the bartender recalled, then cleared his throat.\n\"Speak of the devil.\" He raised his voice and greeted the man who had\njust walked in. \"Well, Doc. Long time since we've had the pleasure of\nyour company. Nice to see you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDoc Bendy was an imposing old gentleman of more than average height and\nmagnificent girth. He carried a paunch with authority. His hands, at the\nends of short arms, seemed to fall naturally to it, and he patted the\npaunch with satisfaction as he spoke. He was dressed for the cold\nweather in an old frock coat, black turning green, with a double line of\noversized buttons down the front and huge eighteenth-century lapels. He\nwore a battered black slouch hat which long ago had given up the\npretense of holding any particular shape.\n\n\"Salutations, gentlemen!\" Doc Bendy boomed, striding majestically toward\nthe bar. \"They tell me our peripatetic little town has just passed\nPittsburgh. I'd have thought it more likely we'd crossed the Arctic\nCircle. Rum, bartender, is the only suitable potable for the occasion.\"\n\nClark introduced Don, who saw that close up Doc Bendy's face was full\nand firm rather than fat. The nose had begun to develop the network of\nvisible blood vessels which indicated a fondness for the bottle. Shaggy\nwhite eyebrows matched the fringe of white hair that sprouted from under\nthe sides and back of the slouch hat. The eyes themselves were alert\nand humorous. The mouth rose subtly at the corners and, though Bendy\nnever seemed to smile outright, it conveyed the same humor as the eyes.\nThese two features, in fact, saved the old man from seeming pompous.\n\nDon noticed that the rum the bartender poured for Bendy was 151 proof\nand the portion was a generous one.\n\nBendy raised his glass. \"Your health, gentlemen.\" He took a sip and put\nit down. \"I might also drink to a happy voyage, destination unknown.\"\n\n\"Don here thinks we're in danger of drifting over Europe.\"\n\n\"A distinct possibility,\" Bendy said. \"Your passports are in order, I\ntrust? I remember the first time I went to the Continent. It was with\nBlack Jack Pershing and the AEF.\"\n\n\"Were you in the Medical Corps, sir?\" Don asked.\n\nDoc Bendy boomed with laughter, holding his paunch. \"Bless your soul,\nlad, I'm no doctor. I was on the board of directors of Superior's first\nhospital, hence the title. A mere courtesy, conferred on me by a\ngrateful citizenry.\"\n\n\"The citizens might be looking to you again, Doc,\" Clark said, \"since\ntheir elected representatives are letting them down.\"\n\n\"But not _bringing_ them down, eh? Suppose you tell me what you know,\nMr. Editor. I assume you're the best-informed man on the situation,\nbarring the conspirators who have dragged us aloft.\"\n\n\"You think it's a conspiracy?\"\n\n\"It's not an act of God.\"\n\nClark began to fill an ancient pipe, so well caked that the pencil with\nwhich he tamped the tobacco barely fitted into the bowl. By the time the\npipe was ready for a match he had exhausted the solid facts. Don then\ntook over and described the underground passage he had seen that\nafternoon. He was about to go further when the old man held up a hand.\n\n\"The facts only, if you please. Mr. Cort, what you saw in the\nunderground chamber fits in remarkably with something I stumbled on this\nafternoon while I was skating.\"\n\n\"Skating?\" Clark said.\n\n\"Ice skating. At North Lake. It's completely frozen over and I'm not so\ndecrepit that I can't glide on a pair of blades. Well, I was gliding\nalong, humming the _Skater's Waltz_, when I tripped over a stump. When I\nsaid I stumbled on something I was speaking literally, because I fell\nflat. While I lay there, with the breath knocked out of me, my face was\nonly an inch from the ice and I realized I was eye-to-eye with a thing.\nJust as you were, Mr. Cort.\"\n\n\"You mean there was something under the ice?\"\n\n\"Exactly. Staring up at me. Balefully, I suppose you could say, as if it\nresented my presence.\"\n\n\"Did you see the whole face?\"\n\n\"I'd be embroidering if I said yes. It seemed--but I must stick to the\nfacts. I saw only the eyes. Two perfectly circular eyes, which glared at\nme for a moment, then disappeared.\"\n\n\"It could have been a fish,\" Clark said.\n\n\"No. A fish is about the most expressionless thing there is, while these\neyes had intelligence behind them. None of your empty, fishy stares.\"\n\nClark knocked his pipe against the edge of the bar so the ashes fell in\nthe vicinity of an old brass cuspidor. \"So, since what you and Don saw\nwere both under the surface, we could put two and two together and\nassume that some kind of alien beings have taken up residence in\nSuperior's lower levels?\"\n\n\"Only if you think two and two make five,\" Doc Bendy said. \"But even if\nthey don't, there's a great deal more going on than Civek knows, or the\nGaret-Rubach crowd at Cavalier will admit. It seems to me, gentlemen,\nthat it's time I set up a committee.\"\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nMiss Leora Frisbie, spinster, was found dead in the mushroom cellar of\nher home on Ryder Avenue in the northeastern part of town. She had been\nsitting in a camp chair, bundled in heavy clothing, when she died. She\nhad been subject to heart trouble and that fact, coupled with notes she\nhad been making on a pad in her lap, led the coroner to believe she had\nbeen frightened to death.\n\nThe first entry on the pad said: _Someone stealing my mushrooms; must\nkeep vigil_. The notes continued:\n\n_Sitting in chair near stairs. Single 60-w. bulb dims, gravity\nincreases. Superior rising again? Movement in corner--soil being pushed\nup from underneath. Hand. Hand? Claw!_\n\n_Claw withdraws._\n\n_Head. Rat? No. Bigger._\n\n_Human? No. But the eyes eyes ey_\n\nThat was all.\n\nPhotostatic copies of the late Miss Frisbie's notes and the coroner's\nreport became exhibits one and two in Doc Bendy's dossier. Exhibit three\nwas a carbon copy of a report by the stock control clerk at the bubble\ngum factory.\n\nBubble gum had been piling up in the warehouse on the railroad siding\nback of Reilly Street. The stock control clerk, Armand Specht, was\ntaking inventory when he saw a movement at the far end of the warehouse.\nHis report follows:\n\n_Investigated and found carton had been dislodged from top of pile and\nbroken into. Gross of Cheeky brand missing. Saw something sitting with\nback to me opening packages, stuffing gum into mouth, wax paper and all,\nhalf-dozen at time. Looked like overgrown chimpanzee. It turned and saw\nme, continuing to chew. Didn't get clear look before it disappeared but\nnoticed two things: one, that its cheeks bulged out from chewing so much\ngum at once, and other, that its eyes were round and bright, even in\ndim corner. Then animal turned and disappeared behind pile of Cheekys.\nNo chimpanzee. Didn't follow right away but when I did it was gone._\n\nExhibit four:\n\n_Dear Diary:\n\n_There wasn't any TV tonight and I asked Grandfather Bendy what to do and\nhe said \"Marie, when I was young, boys and girls made their own fun\" and\nso I got out the Scrabble and asked Mom and Dad to play but they said no\nthey had to go to the Warners and play bridge. So they went and I was\nplaying pretending I was both sides when the door opened and I said\nHello Grandfather but it wasn't him it was like a kangaroo and it had\nbig eyes that were friendly._\n\n_After a while I went over and scratched its ears and it liked that and\nthen it went over to the table and looked at the Scrabble. I thought\nwouldn't it be funny if it could play but it couldn't. But it could\nspell! It had hands like claws with long black fingernails and fur on\nthem (the fingers) and it pushed the letters around so they spelled Name\nand I spelled out Marie._\n\n_Then I spelled out Who are you and it spelled Gizl._\n\n_Then I spelled How old are you and it put all the blank spaces together._\n\n_I said Where do you live and it spelled Here. Then I changed to Where do\nyou come from and it pointed to the blanks again._\n\n_The gizl went away before Mom and Dad came home and I didn't tell them\nabout it but I'll tell Grandfather Bendy because he understands better\nabout things like the time I had an invisible friend._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDon Cort went to bed in the dormitory at Cavalier with the surprised\nrealization that it had been only twenty-four hours since Superior took\noff. It seemed more like a week. When he woke up the floating town was\nover New York.\n\nSome high-flying skywriters were at work. _Welcome Superior--Drink\nPepsi-Cola_ their message said.\n\nDon dressed quickly and hurried to the brink. Alis Garet was there among\na little crowd, bundled up in a parka.\n\n\"Is that the Hudson River?\" she asked him. \"Where's the Empire State\nBuilding?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"Haven't you ever been to New York? I can't quite make\nit out. It's somewhere south of that patch of green--that's Central\nPark.\"\n\n\"No, I've never been out of Ohio. I thought New York was a big city.\"\n\n\"It's big enough. Don't forget we're four miles up. Have you seen any\nplanes besides the skywriters?\"\n\n\"Just some airliners, way down,\" she said. \"Were you expecting someone?\"\n\n\"Seeing how it's our last port of call, I thought there might be some\nFederal boys flying around. I shouldn't think they'd want a chunk of\ntheir real estate exported to Europe.\"\n\n\"Are we going to Europe?\"\n\n\"Bound to if we don't change course.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"My very next words were going to be 'Don't ask me why.' I ask you.\nYou're closer to the horse's mouth than I am.\"\n\n\"If you mean Father,\" Alis said, \"I told you I don't enjoy his\nconfidence.\"\n\n\"Haven't you even got an inkling of what he's up to?\"\n\n\"I'm sure he's not the Master Mind, if that's what you mean.\"\n\n\"Then who is? Rubach? Civek? The chief of police? Or the bubble gum\nking, whoever he is?\"\n\n\"Cheeky McFerson?\" She laughed. \"I went to grade school with him and if\nhe's got a mind I never noticed it.\"\n\n\"McFerson? He's just a kid, isn't he?\"\n\n\"His father died a couple of years ago and Cheeky's the president on\npaper, but the business office runs things. We call him Cheeky because\nhe always had a wad of company gum in his cheek. Supposed to be an\nadvertisement. But he never gave me any and I always chewed Wrigley's\nfor spite.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Don chewed the inside of his own cheek and watched the coastline.\n\"That's Connecticut now,\" he said. \"We're certainly not slowing down for\ncustoms.\"\n\nA speck, trailing vapor through the cold upper air, headed toward them\nfrom the general direction of New England. As it came closer Don saw\nthat it was a B-58 Hustler bomber. He recognized it by the mysterious\npod it carried under its body, three-quarters as long as the fuselage.\n\n\"It's not going to shoot us down, is it?\" Alis asked.\n\n\"Hardly. I'm glad to see it. It's about time somebody took an interest\nin us besides Bobby Thebold and his leftover Lightnings.\"\n\nThe B-58 rapidly closed the last few miles between them, banked and\ncircled Superior.\n\n\"Attention people of Superior,\" a voice from the plane said. The\nmagnified words reached them distinctly through the cold air. \"Inasmuch\nas you are now leaving the continental United States, this aircraft has\nbeen assigned to accompany you. From this point on you are under the\nprotection of the United States Air Force.\"\n\n\"That's better,\" Don said. \"It's not much, but at least somebody's doing\nsomething.\"\n\nThe B-58 streaked off and took up a course in a vast circle around them.\n\n\"I'm not so sure I like having it around,\" Alis said. \"I mean suppose\nthey find out that Superior's controlled by--I don't know--let's say a\nforeign power, or an alien race. Once we're out over the Atlantic where\nnobody else could get hurt, wouldn't they maybe consider it a small\nsacrifice to wipe out Superior to get rid of the--the alien?\"\n\nDon looked at her closely. \"What's this about an alien? What do you\nknow?\"\n\n\"I don't _know_ anything. It's just a feeling I have, that this is\nbigger than Father and Mayor Civek and all the self-important VIP's in\nSuperior put together.\" She squeezed his arm as if to draw comfort from\nhim. \"Maybe it's seeing the ocean and realizing the vastness of it, but\nfor the first time I'm beginning to feel a little scared.\"\n\n\"I won't say there's nothing to be afraid of,\" Don said. He pulled her\nhand through his arm. \"It isn't as though this were a precedented\nsituation. But whatever's going on, remember there are some pretty good\npeople on our side, too.\"\n\n\"I know,\" she said. \"And you're one of them.\"\n\nHe wondered what she meant by that. Nothing, probably, except \"Thank you\nfor the reassurance.\" He decided that was it; the mechanical\neavesdropper he wore under his collar was making him too self-conscious.\nHe tried to think of something appropriate to say to her that he\nwouldn't mind having overheard in the Pentagon.\n\nNothing occurred to him, so he drew Alis closer and gave her a quick,\nquiet kiss.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe crowd of people looking over the edge had grown. Judging by their\nnumber, few people were in school or at their jobs today. Yesterday they\nhad seemed only mildly interested in what their town was up to but\ntoday, with the North American continent about to be left behind, they\nwere paying more attention. Yet Don could see no signs of alarm on their\nfaces. At most there was a reflection of wonder, but not much more than\nthere might be among a group of Europeans seeing New York Harbor from\nshipboard for the first time. An apathetic bunch, he decided, who would\nbe resigned to their situation so long as the usual pattern of their\nlives was not interfered with unduly. What they lacked, of course, was\nleadership.\n\n\"It's big, isn't it?\" Alis said. She was looking at the Atlantic, which\nwas virtually the only thing left to see except the bright blue sky, a\nstrip of the New England coast, and the circling bomber.\n\n\"It's going to get bigger,\" Don said. \"Shall we go across town and take\na last look at the States?\" He also wanted to see what, if anything, was\ngoing on in town.\n\n\"Not the last, I hope. I'd prefer a round trip.\"\n\nAn enterprising cab driver opened his door for them. \"Special excursion\nrate to the west end,\" he said. \"One buck.\"\n\n\"You're on,\" Don said. \"How's business?\"\n\n\"Not what you'd call booming. No trains to meet. No buses. Hi, Alis.\nThis isn't one of your father's brainstorms come to life, is it?\"\n\n\"Hi, Chuck,\" she said. \"I seriously doubt it, though I'm sure you'd\nnever get him to admit it. How are your wife and the boy?\"\n\n\"Fine. That boy, he's got some imagination. He's digging a hole in the\nback yard. Last week he told us he was getting close to China. This week\nit's Australia. He said at supper last night that they must have heard\nabout this hole and started digging from the other end. They've\nconnected up, according to him, and he had quite a conversation with a\nkangaroo.\"\n\n\"A kangaroo?\" Don sat up straight.\n\n\"Yeah. You know how kids are. I guess he's studying Australia in\ngeography.\"\n\n\"What did the kangaroo tell your son?\"\n\nThe cab driver laughed defensively. \"There's nothing wrong with the boy.\nHe's just got an active mind.\"\n\n\"Of course. When I was a kid I used to talk to bears. But what did he\nsay the kangaroo talked about?\"\n\n\"Oh, just crazy stuff--like the kangaroos didn't like it Down Under any\nmore and were coming up here because it was safer.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLater that morning, at about the time Don Cort estimated that Superior\nhad passed the twelve-mile limit--east from the coast, not up--the\nSuperior State Bank was held up.\n\nA man clearly recognized as Joe Negus, a small-time gambler, and one\nother man had driven up to the bank in Negus' flashy Buick convertible.\nThey walked up to the head teller, threatened him with pistols and\ndemanded all the money in all the tills. They stuffed the bills in a\nsack, got into their car and drove off. They took nothing from the\ncustomers and made no attempt to take anything from the vault.\n\nThe fact that they ignored the vault made Don feel better. He thought\nwhen he first heard about the robbery that the men might have been after\nthe brief case he'd stored there, which would have meant that he was\nunder suspicion. But apparently the job was a genuine heist, not a\ncover-up for something else.\n\nPolice Chief Vincent Grande reached the scene half an hour after the\ncriminals left it. His car had frozen up and wouldn't start. He arrived\nby taxi, red-faced, fingering the butt of his holstered service\nautomatic.\n\nNegus and his confederate, identified as a poolroom lounger named Hank\nStacy, had gotten away with a hundred thousand dollars.\n\n\"I didn't know there was that much money in town,\" was Grande's comment\non that. While he was asking other questions the telephone rang and\nsomeone told the bank president he'd seen Negus and Stacy go into the\npoolroom. In fact, the robbers' convertible was parked blatantly in\nfront of the place.\n\nGrande, looking as if he'd rather be dog catcher, got back into the\ntaxi.\n\nJoe Negus and Hank Stacy were sitting on opposite sides of a pool table\nwhen the police chief got there, dividing the money in three piles. A\nthird man stood by, watching closely. He was Jerry Lynch, a lawyer. He\ngreeted Grande.\n\n\"Morning, Vince,\" he said easily. \"Come to shoot a little pool?\"\n\n\"I'll shoot some bank robbers if they don't hand over that money,\"\nGrande said. He had his gun out and looked almost purposeful.\n\nNegus and Stacy made no attempt to go for their guns, Stacy seemed\nnervous but Negus went on counting the money without looking up.\n\n\"Is it your money, Vince?\" Jerry Lynch asked.\n\n\"You know damn well whose money it is. Now let's have it.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I couldn't do that,\" the lawyer said. \"In the first place I\nwouldn't want to, thirty-three and a third per cent of it being mine,\nand in the second place you have no authority.\"\n\n\"I'm the chief of police,\" Grande said doggedly. \"I don't want to spill\nany blood--\"\n\n\"Don't flash your badge at me, Vince,\" Lynch said. Negus had finished\ncounting the money and the lawyer took one of the piles and put it in\nvarious pockets. \"I said you had no authority. Bank robbery is a federal\noffense. Not that I admit there's been a robbery. But if you suspect a\ncrime it's your duty to go to the proper authorities. The FBI would be\nindicated, if you know where they can be reached.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Joe Negus said. \"Go take a flying jump for yourself, Chief.\"\n\n\"Listen, you cheap crook--\"\n\n\"Hardly cheap, Vince,\" Lynch said. \"And not even a crook, in my\nprofessional opinion. Mr. Negus pleads extra-territoriality.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat was the start of Superior's crime wave.\n\nSomebody broke the plate-glass window of George Tocher's dry-goods store\nand got away with blankets, half a dozen overcoats and several sets of\nwoolen underwear.\n\nA fuel-oil truck disappeared from the street outside of Dabney Brothers'\nand was found abandoned in the morning. About nine hundred gallons had\nbeen drained out--as if someone had filled his cellar tank and a couple\nof his neighbors'.\n\nThe back door of the supermarket was forced and somebody made off with\na variety of groceries. The missing goods would have just about filled\none car.\n\nEach of these crimes was understandable--Superior's growing food and\nfuel shortage and icy temperatures had led a few people to desperation.\n\nBut there were other incidents. Somebody smashed the window at\nKimbrough's Jewelry Store and snatched a display of medium-priced\nwatches.\n\nHalf a dozen young vandals sneaked into the Catholic Church and began\ntoppling statues of the saints. When they were surprised by Father Brian\nthey fled, bombarding him with prayer books. One of the books shattered\na stained-glass window depicting Christ dispensing loaves and fishes.\n\nSomebody started a fire in the movie-house balcony and nearly caused a\npanic.\n\nVincent Grande rushed from place to place, investigating, but rarely\nlearned enough to make an arrest. The situation was becoming unpleasant.\nSuperior had always been a friendly place to live, where everyone knew\neveryone else, at least to say hello to, but now there was suspicion and\nfear, not to mention increasing cold and threatened famine.\n\nEveryone was cheered up, therefore, when Mayor Hector Civek announced a\nmass meeting in Town Square. Bonfires were lit and the reviewing stand\nthat was used for the annual Founders' Day parade was hauled out as a\nspeaker's platform.\n\nCivek was late. The crowd, bundled up against the cold, was stamping\ntheir feet and beginning to shout a bit when he arrived. There was a\nmedium-sized cheer as the mayor climbed to the platform.\n\n\"Fellow citizens,\" he began, then stopped to search through his overcoat\npockets.\n\n\"Well,\" he went on, \"I guess I put the speech in an inside pocket and\nit's too cold to look for it. I know what it says, anyway.\"\n\nThis brought a few laughs. Don Cort stood near the edge of the crowd\nand watched the people around him. They mostly had a no-nonsense look\nabout them, as if they were not going to be satisfied with more oratory.\n\nCivek said, \"I'm not going to keep you standing in the cold and tell you\nwhat you already know--how our food supplies are dwindling, how we're\nusing up our stocks of coal and fuel oil with no immediate hope of\nreplacement--you know all that.\"\n\n\"We sure do, Hector,\" somebody called out.\n\n\"Yes; so, as I say, I'm not going to talk about what the problem is. We\ndon't need words--we need action.\"\n\nHe paused as if he expected a cheer, or applause, but the crowd merely\nwaited for him to go on.\n\n\"If Superior had been hit by a flood or a tornado,\" Civek said, \"we\ncould look to the Red Cross and the State or Federal Government for\nhelp. But we've been the victims of a far greater misfortune, torn from\nthe bosom of Mother Earth and flung--\"\n\n\"Oh, come on, Hector,\" an old woman said. \"We're getting froze.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry about that, Mrs. Potts,\" Civek said. \"You should be home\nwhere it's warm.\"\n\n\"We ran out of coal for the furnace and now we're running out of logs.\nAre you going to do something about that?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what I'm going to do, Mrs. Potts, for you and all the\nother wonderful people here tonight. We're going to put a stop to this\nlawlessness we never had before. We're going to make Superior a place to\nbe proud of. Superior has changed--risen, you might say, to a new\nstatus. We're more than a town, now. We're free and separate, not only\nfrom Ohio, but from the United States.\n\n\"We're a sovereign place, a--a sovereignty, and we need new methods to\ncope with new conditions, to restore law and order, to see that all our\nsubjects--our citizen-subjects--are provided for.\"\n\nThe crowd had become hushed as Civek neared his point.\n\n\"To that noble end,\" Civek went on, \"I dedicate myself, and I take this\nmomentous step and hereby proclaim the existence of the Kingdom of\nSuperior\"--he paused to take a deep breath--\"and proclaim myself its\nfirst King.\"\n\nHe stopped. His oratory had carried him to a climax and he didn't quite\nknow where to go from there. Maybe he expected cheers to carry him over,\nbut none came. There was complete silence except for the crackling of\nthe bonfires.\n\nBut after a moment there was a shuffling of feet and a whispering that\ngrew to a murmur. Then out of the murmur came derisive shouts and\ncatcalls.\n\n\"King Hector the First!\" somebody hooted. \"Long live the king!\"\n\nThe words could have been gratifying but the tone of voice was all\nwrong.\n\n\"Where's Hector's crown?\" somebody else cried. \"Hey, Jack, did you\nforget to bring the crown?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Jack said. \"I forgot. But I got a rope over on my truck. We\ncould elevate him that way.\"\n\nJack was obviously joking, but a group of men in another part of the\ncrowd pushed toward the platform. \"Yeah,\" one of them said, \"let's\nstring him up.\"\n\nA woman at the back of the crowd screamed. Two hairy figures about five\nfeet tall appeared from the darkness. They were kangaroo-like, with long\ntails. No one tried to stop them, and the creatures reached the platform\nand pulled Hector down. They placed him between them and, their way\nclear now, began to hop away.\n\nTheir hops grew longer as they reached the edge of the square. Their\nleaps had become prodigious as they disappeared in the direction of\nNorth Lake, Civek in his heavy coat looking almost like one of them.\n\nDon Cort couldn't tell whether the creatures were kidnaping Civek or\nrescuing him.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nHector Civek hadn't been found by the time Judge Helms' court convened\nat 10:00 A.M.\n\nJoe Negus was there, wearing a new suit and looking confident. His\nconfederate, Hank Stacy, was obviously trying to achieve the same poise\nbut not succeeding. Jerry Lynch, their lawyer, was talking to Ed Clark.\n\nDon Cort took a seat the editor had saved for him in the front row. Alis\nGaret came in and sat next to him. \"I cut my sociology class,\" she told\nhim. \"Anybody find His Majesty yet?\"\n\n\"No,\" Don said. \"Who gave him that crackpot idea?\"\n\n\"He's had big ideas ever since he ran for the State Assembly. He got\nlicked then, but this is the first time he's been kidnaped. Or should it\nbe kanganaped? Poor Hector. I shouldn't joke about it.\"\n\nJudge Helms, who was really a justice of the peace, came in through a\nside door and the clerk banged his gavel. But the business of the court\ndid not get under way immediately. Someone burst in from the street and\nshouted:\n\n\"He's back! Civek's back!\"\n\nThe people at the rear of the room rushed out to see. In a moment they\nwere crowding back in behind Hector Civek's grand entrance.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" Alis said. \"Don't tell me he made it this time!\"\n\nCivek was wearing the trappings of royalty. He walked with dignity down\nthe aisle, an ermine robe on his shoulders, a crown on his head and a\nscepter in his right hand.\n\nHe nodded benignly about him. \"Good morning, Judge,\" he said. To the\nclerk he said, \"Frank, see to our horses, will you?\"\n\n\"Horses?\" the clerk said, blinking.\n\n\"Our royal coach is without, and the horses need attending to,\" Civek\nsaid patiently. \"You don't think a king walks, do you?\"\n\nThe clerk went out, puzzled. Judge Helms took off his pince-nez and\nregarded the spectacle of Hector Civek in ermine.\n\n\"What is all this, Hector?\" he asked. \"You weren't serious about that\nking business, were you? Nice to see you back safe, by the way.\"\n\n\"We would prefer to be addressed the first time as Your Majesty, Judge,\"\nCivek said. \"After that you can call us sir.\"\n\n\"Us?\" the judge asked. \"Somebody with you?\"\n\n\"The royal 'we,'\" Civek said. \"I see I'll have to issue a proclamation\non the proper forms of address. I mean, _we'll_ have to. Takes a bit of\ngetting used to, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"Quite a bit,\" the judge agreed. \"But right now, if you don't mind, this\ncourt is in session and has a case before it. Suppose you make your\nroyal self comfortable and we'll get on with it--as soon as my clerk is\nback from attending to the royal horses.\"\n\nThe clerk returned and whispered in the judge's ear. Helms looked at\nCivek and shook his head. \"Six of them, eh? I'll have a look later.\nRight now we've got a bank robbery case on the calendar.\"\n\nVincent Grande talked and Jerry Lynch talked and Judge Helms listened\nand looked up statutes and pursed his lips thoughtfully. Joe Negus\ncleaned his nails. Hank Stacy bit his.\n\nFinally the judge said, \"I hate to admit this, but I'm afraid I must\nagree with you, counselor. The alleged crime contravened no local\nstatute, and in the absence of a representative of the Federal\nGovernment I must regretfully dismiss the charges.\"\n\nJoe Negus promptly got up and began to walk out.\n\n\"Just a minute there, varlet!\"\n\nIt was Hector Civek doing his king bit.\n\nNegus, who probably had been called everything else in his life, paused\nand looked over his shoulder.\n\n\"Approach!\" Civek thundered.\n\n\"Nuts, Your Kingship,\" Negus said. \"Nobody stops me now.\" But before he\ngot to the door something stopped him in mid-stride.\n\nCivek had pointed his scepter at Negus in that instant. Negus, stiff as\na stop-action photograph, toppled to the floor.\n\n\"Now,\" Civek said, motioning to Judge Helms to vacate the bench, \"we'll\ndispense some royal justice.\"\n\nHe sat down, arranging his robes and shifting his heavy crown. \"Mr.\nCounselor Lynch, we take it you represent the defendants?\"\n\n\"Yes, Your Majesty,\" said the lawyer, an adaptable man. \"What happened\nto Negus, sir? Is he dead?\"\n\n\"He could have been, if we'd given him another notch. No, he's just\nsuspended. Let him be an example to anyone else who might incur our\nroyal wrath. Now, counselor, we are familiar enough with the case to\nrender an impartial verdict. We find the defendants guilty of bank\nrobbery.\"\n\n\"But Your Majesty,\" Lynch said, \"bank robbery is not a crime under the\nlaws of Superior. I submit that there has been no crime--inasmuch as the\nincident occurred after Superior became detached from Earth, and\ntherefore from its laws.\"\n\n\"There is the King's Law,\" Civek said. \"We decree bank robbery a crime,\ntogether with all other offenses against the county, state and country\nwhich are not specifically covered in Superior's statutes.\"\n\n\"Retroactively?\" Lynch asked.\n\n\"Of course. We will now pronounce sentence. First, restitution of the\nmoney, except for ten per cent to the King's Bench. Second, indefinite\nparalysis for Negus. We'll straighten out his arms and legs so he'll\ntake up less room. Third, probation for Hank Stacy here, with a warning\nto him to stay out of bad company. Court's adjourned.\"\n\nCivek wouldn't say where he'd got the costume or the coach-and-six or\nthe paralyzing scepter. He refused to say where the two kangaroo-like\ncreatures had taken him. He allowed his ermine to be fingered, holding\nthe scepter out of reach, talked vaguely about better times to come now\nthat Superior was a monarchy, then ordered his coach.\n\nBy royal decree Hank Stacy, who had been inching toward the door, became\nroyal coachman, commanded to serve out his probation in the king's\ncustody. Stacy drove Civek home. No one seemed to remember who had been\nat the reins when the coach first appeared.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nEd Clark was setting type for an extra when Don and Alis visited his\nshop.\n\nKING'S IN BUSINESS, the headline said.\n\n\"You don't sound like a loyal subject,\" Don said.\n\n\"Can't say I am,\" Clark admitted. \"Guess I won't get to be a royal\nprinter.\"\n\n\"What's the story about?\" Alis asked. \"The splendid triumph of justice\nin court this morning?\"\n\n\"No. Everybody knows all about that already. I've got the inside\nstory--what happens next. Just like _The New York Times_.\"\n\n\"Where'd you get it?\" Don asked.\n\nClark winked. \"Like Scotty Reston, I am not at liberty to divulge my\nsources. Let's just say it was learned authoritatively.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Alis said, \"what does happen next?\"\n\n\"'His Unconstitutional Majesty, King Hector I, will attempt to prop up\nhis shaky monarchy by seeking an ambassador from the United States, the\n_Sentry_ learned today. Such recognition, if obtained, would be followed\nimmediately by a demand for \"foreign aid.\"\n\n\"'It is the thesis of the self-proclaimed king--known until 24 hours ago\nas just plain Hector--that the satellite status of Superior, the\ntraveling townoid, makes it a potentially effective arm of U. S.\ndiplomacy. King Hector will point out to the State Department the\nbenefits of bolstering Superior's economy, especially during its\nexpected foray over Europe and, barring such misfortune as being shot\ndown en route, into the Soviet domain.\n\n\"'The King will not suggest in so many words that Superior would make a\ngood spy platform, but the implication is there. It will also be implied\nthat unless economic aid--which in plain English means food and fuel to\nkeep Superior from starving and freezing to death--is forthcoming from\nthe United States, Superior may choose the path of neutrality ...'\n\n\"That's as far as I've got,\" Clark said.\n\n\"I suppose the 'path of neutrality' means Superior might consider hiring\nitself out to the highest bidder?\" Don asked.\n\n\"That would be one way of putting it,\" Clark said. \"Undiplomatic but\naccurate.\"\n\n\"How does Civek intend to get his message to Washington?\" asked Don,\naware that it had already been transmitted to the Pentagon via the\ntransceiver under his collar. \"Bottle over the side?\"\n\n\"My sources tell me they've got WCAV working on short wave. That right,\nAlis?\"\n\n\"Don't ask me. I only live there.\"\n\n\"Do you still think Civek is fronting for the Cavalier crowd?\" Don asked\nher.\n\n\"I don't remember saying that,\" she said. \"I think I agreed with you\nwhen you said Civek was ineffectual. Who do _you_ think is behind him?\nDo you think he's king of the kangaroos?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Don said, \"they're the ones who took him away last night. And\nwhen he came back this morning he had all the trappings. He didn't get\nthat coach-and-six from foreign aid.\"\n\nEd Clark said, \"This is all very fascinating, kids, but it's not helping\nme get out my extra. Don, why don't you take the little lady out to\nlunch? You can continue your theorizing over the blueplate special at\nthe Riverside Inn. Only place in town still open, they tell me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDoc Bendy was hurrying out of the Riverside Inn as they reached it. He\nwaved to them. \"Save your money. His Gracious Majesty is throwing a free\nlunch for everybody.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"At the palace, of course.\"\n\n\"What palace?\" Alis asked.\n\n\"The bubble gum factory. He's taken it over.\"\n\n\"Why the gum factory?\"\n\n\"Cheeky McFerson offered it to him. Not the factory itself but the big\nold house near the west wing. The mansion that's been closed up since\nthe old man died. They say Cheeky's been given a title as part of the\nbargain.\"\n\n\"Sir Cheeky?\" Alis asked, giggling.\n\n\"Something like that. Lord Chicle, maybe, or Baron de Mouthful. Come on.\nIt should be quite a show.\"\n\nDozens of people were in the streets, all heading in the same direction.\nWord of the king's largess spread fast and, on the factory grounds,\nguards were directing the crowd to a line that disappeared into a side\ndoor of the old McFerson mansion.\n\nA flag flew from the top of a pole at the front of the house. It was\nwhipping in a stiff breeze and Don couldn't make out the device, except\nthat a crown formed part of it.\n\nOne of the guards recognized Alis Garet and directed her to the front\ndoor. She took Doc Bendy and Don by their arms. \"Come on,\" she said.\n\"We're VIP's. Father must have sworn allegiance.\"\n\nThe chief of police was sitting behind a desk in the wide front hall but\nhe now wore a military tunic with a chestful of decorations (including\nthe Good Conduct Medal, Sergeant Cort noticed), and the visor of his\nmilitary cap was overrun with gold curlicues.\n\n\"Well, Vince,\" Bendy said. \"I see you got in on the ground floor.\"\n\n\"General Sir Vincent Grande, Minister of Defense,\" Grande said with a\nstiff little bow, \"at your service.\"\n\n\"Enchanted,\" Bendy said, bowing back. \"Tell me, Vince, how do you keep a\nstraight face?\"\n\n\"I'll overlook that, Bendy, and I'll give you a friendly tip. The\ncountry is on a sound basis now and we intend to keep it that way.\nObstructionists will be dealt with.\"\n\n\"The country, eh? Well, let's go in and see how it's being run.\"\n\nA clattery hubbub came from the big room on the right. To Don it sounded\nlike any GI mess hall. It also looked like one. The line of people\ncoming in through the side door helped themselves to tin trays and\nsilverware, then moved slowly past a row of huge pots from which\nwhite-coated men and women ladled out food. At the end of the serving\nline stood Cheeky McFerson, splendid in purple velvet. He was putting a\npiece of bubble gum on each tray.\n\nOn the other side of the room, opposite the servers, King Hector sat on\na raised chair, crown on head, scepter in hand, nodding benevolently to\nanyone who looked at him. On each side of the king, sitting in lower\nchairs, were members of what must have been his court. Professor Osbert\nGaret was one of them, and Maynard Rubach, president of the Cavalier\nInstitute of Applied Sciences, was another.\n\n\"Oh, dear, there's Father,\" Alis said in dismay. \"What is that silly hat\nhe's wearing? It makes him look like Merlin.\"\n\n\"But Civek doesn't look a bit like King Arthur,\" Bendy said. \"Let's go\npay our respects. Straight faces, now.\"\n\n\"Ah, my dear,\" the king said when he saw Alis. \"And gentlemen. Welcome\nto our court. May we introduce two of our associates? Sir Osbert Garet,\nRoyal Astronaut, and Lord Rubach, Minister of Education.\"\n\n\"Father!\" Alis spoke sharply to the Royal Astronaut. \"How silly can you\nget?\"\n\n\"Now, now, child,\" the king said reprovingly. \"You must not risk our\ndispleasure. For the time being our rule must be absolute--until the\nsafety of our kingdom has been assured. Sir Osbert,\" he said, \"we trust\nthat at a more propitious time you will have a serious talk with your\ncharming but impetuous daughter.\"\n\n\"My liege, I shall deal with her,\" the Royal Astronaut said, glowering\nat Alis. \"As Your Majesty has so wisely observed, she is but a slip of a\ngirl.\"\n\nHer father's apparent sincerity left Alis speechless. She looked from\nBendy to Don, but they seemed to consider discretion and masklike faces\nthe better part of candor.\n\n\"Well spoken, Sir Osbert,\" the king said. He clapped his hands and a\nservant jumped. \"Dinner for these three. Find a table, my friends, and\nyou will be served.\"\n\nDon firmly guided Alis away. She had seemed about to explode. They found\nan empty table out of earshot of the king, and three footmen looking\nlike refugees from _Alice in Wonderland_ immediately began to serve\nthem.\n\nBendy spread a napkin over his lap. \"Let's curb our snickers and fill\nour stomachs,\" he said, \"and later we can go out behind the barn and\nlaugh our heads off. Meanwhile, keep your eyes open.\"\n\nThey were eating meat loaf and potatoes. The meat loaf was so highly\nspiced that it could have been almost anything.\n\n\"I wonder where His Worship got all the grub,\" Alis said.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Don said, \"but it certainly doesn't look as if he needs\nany foreign aid.\"\n\nAlis put down her fork suddenly and her eyes got big. She said, \"You\ndon't suppose--\"\n\n\"Suppose what?\" Bendy said, spearing a small potato.\n\n\"I just had a horrible thought.\" She laughed feebly. \"It's ridiculous,\nof course, but I wondered if by any chance we were eating Joe Negus.\"\n\n\"Don't be silly,\" Don said, but he put down his fork too.\n\n\"Of course it's ridiculous,\" Bendy said. \"Hector only put Negus to\nsleep. He didn't kill him. Besides, Joe Negus wouldn't stretch far\nenough to feed this crowd.\"\n\n\"Is that why you're not eating any more?\" Alis asked him.\n\n\"Why, no,\" Bendy said. \"It's merely that I've had enough. It's true that\nHector could have used his scepter on other transgressors, but--no, I\nrefuse to admit that he's turned cannibal.\"\n\n\"_He_ isn't eating,\" Don pointed out.\n\n\"I'll guarantee you he has, though. I've never known Hector to miss a\nmeal. No. Hector may be a fool and a dupe, and power-hungry to boot, but\nhe's not a cruel man, or a deranged one.\"\n\n\"No?\" Alis said. \"I dare you to ask him what's in the meat loaf.\"\n\n\"All right.\" Bendy got up. \"I'll ask to see the kitchen--to compliment\nthe chef. Want to come?\"\n\n\"No, thanks. I might be mean to Father again.\"\n\nShe and Don watched Doc Bendy go to the improvised throne and talk to\nCivek. The king laughed and stood up and he and Bendy crossed the room.\nThey went through a door behind the line of servers.\n\nDon pushed his plate away. \"You've certainly spoiled my appetite.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Alis said. \"Maybe it's hereditary. Look at Father in that\nidiot hat. Sir Osbert! Honestly, Don, if we ever get back to Earth I'm\ngoing to get out of Superior as fast as I can. What's it like in\nWashington?\"\n\n\"Dull,\" he said. \"Humid in the summer. And when you've exhausted the\nnational monuments there's nothing to do.\"\n\n\"Nothing? Don't tell me you don't have a girl friend back there. No,\n_don't_ tell me--I don't want to know. Oh, Don, what a terribly boring\nplace this must be for you.\"\n\n\"Boring!\" he said. \"I've never had such a wild, crazy time in my life.\nFurthermore,\" he said, \"there's nobody like you back in Washington.\"\n\nShe beamed. \"I'd kiss you right here, only Doc Bendy's coming back.\nHeck, I'll kiss you anyway.\"\n\nShe did.\n\n\"Ahem,\" said Bendy. \"Also cough-cough. If you two can spare the time,\nthere's someone I'd like you to meet.\"\n\n\"We're through, for now,\" Alis said. \"Who?\"\n\n\"One of our hosts. The power behind the shaky throne of Hector the\nFirst. I think you'll like him. He has a magnificent tail.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Hector was very co-operative,\" Doc Bendy said. \"I guess he figured he\ncouldn't keep it a secret for long anyhow, so he decided to be frank.\nAfter all, half the town saw them take him away.\"\n\n\"You mean Civek admits he's only a figurehead?\" Don asked.\n\n\"Oh, he wouldn't admit that. His story is that it's a working\narrangement--a treaty of sorts. He's absolute monarch as far as the\nhuman inhabitants are concerned, but the kangaroos control Superior as a\npiece of geography.\"\n\n\"I knew Father couldn't have done it,\" Alis murmured.\n\nThey went down a flight of stairs off the main hall to a basement room.\nIt was luxuriously furnished, as every room in the mansion must have\nbeen. There was a rug over inlaid linoleum and a blazing fireplace. A\nhuge round mahogany table stood in the center of the room.\n\nHector Civek sat in one of the half-dozen leather armchairs drawn up to\nthe table. In another sat a furry, genial-looking blue-gray kangaroo.\n\nOnly it wasn't really a kangaroo, Don realized. It was more human than\nanimal in several ways. Its bearing, for instance, had dignity, and its\nround eyes had intelligence. A thick tail at least three feet long stuck\nthrough a space under the backrest of the armchair. As Doc Bendy had\nsaid, the tail was magnificent.\n\nCivek nodded and smiled, apparently willing to forget his flare-up at\nAlis. \"I'll introduce you,\" Civek said. \"I mean _we'll_ introduce you.\nOh, the hell with the royal 'we,' as long I'm among friends. This is\nGizl, and what I'm trying to say is that he doesn't speak English.\nDoesn't talk at all, as far as I can tell. But he understands the\nlanguage and he can read and write it. That's why all this.\"\n\nHe indicated the letter and number squares on the table. They were from\nsets of games--Scrabble, Anagrams, I-Qubes, Lotto and poker dice.\n\n\"My granddaughter met Gizl, you'll recall,\" Doc Bendy said. \"Either this\none or one like him. We don't know yet whether Gizl is a personal name\nor a generic one.\"\n\n\"Let's find out,\" Don said. He sat down at the table and began to form\nsquares into a question.\n\n\"Wait a minute.\" Doc Bendy broke up Don's sequence. \"The amenities\nfirst. Spell out 'Greetings,' or some such things. Manners, boy.\"\n\n\"Sorry.\" Don started over. He spelled GREETINGS, then ALIS GARET, then\nDON CORT, and pointed from the squares to Alis and himself. \"I assume\nyou've already introduced yourself?\" he asked Bendy.\n\nBendy nodded and the kangaroo-like creature inclined his furry head in\nacknowledgment to Alis and Don. Then he--Don had already stopped\nthinking of the creature as an \"it\"--formed two words with his tapering,\nblack-nailed fingers.\n\nPLEASANT, he communicated. \"GIZL.\" And he tapped his chest.\n\nDon turned to Bendy. \"Now can I ask him?\"\n\n\"With His Majesty's permission,\" Bendy said solemnly.\n\nHector nodded. Don left the three names intact, distributing the rest,\nthen put three squares together to spell _Man_. He pointed to the word\nand then to Civek, Bendy, Alis and himself, excluding the creature.\n\n\"Well, I like that!\" Alis said. \"Do I look like a man?\"\n\n\"Let's keep it simple, woman,\" Don said.\n\nThe creature nodded and pointed again to GIZL, then to himself, \"He\ndoesn't understand,\" Don said.\n\n\"It's quite possible his people don't have individual names,\" Bendy\nsaid. \"Let's call him Gizl for now and go on.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" Don thought for a moment, then formed a question. \"Might as well\nget basic,\" he said.\n\nQ. ARE YOU FROM EARTH.\n\nA. NO.\n\nAt the risk of irritating the others, Don repeated the questions and\nanswers aloud for the benefit of his eavesdropper in the Pentagon.\n\nQ. ARE YOU FROM SOLAR SYSTEM\n\nA. NOT YOURS\n\nQ. WHEN DID YOU REACH EARTH\n\nA. 1948 YOUR CALENDAR\n\nQ. WHY\n\nA. FRIENDSHIP\n\nQ. WHY HAS NO ONE SEEN YOU SOONER\n\nA. FEAR\n\nQ.

Let me talk to him a while, Don.\"\n\nQ. HOW MANY ARE THERE OF YOU\n\nA. MANY\n\nQ. HOW MANY\n\nA. NO SPECIFIC COMMENT\n\nQ. ARE YOU RESPONSIBLE FOR RAISING SUPERIOR\n\nA. ENTIRELY\n\nQ. HOW\n\nA.

TERMINATING INTERVIEW WITH GOOD WILL ASSURANCES\n\n\"Wait,\" Alis said. \"I haven't had a chance to talk to him.\" She formed\nletters into words. \"I don't think he's being very frank with us but I\nhave a few random questions.\"\n\nQ. HOW MANY SEXES HAVE GIZLS\n\nA. THREE\n\nQ. MALE FEMALE AND\n\nA. NEUTER\n\nQ. ARE THERE BABIES AMONG YOU\n\nA. BABIES ARE NEUTER AND DEVELOP ACCORDING TO NEED\n\nQ.

LIKEWISE\n\nGizl slid back his chair and got up. King Hector stood and bowed as\nGizl, who had nodded politely to each in turn, walked manlike, without\nhopping, to a corner of the room which then sank out of sight.\n\n\"He's quite a guy, that Gizl,\" Hector said, taking off his crown and\nputting it on the table. \"Makes me sweat,\" he said, wiping his forehead.\n\n\"Are you the duly constituted authority?\" Bendy asked him.\n\n\"Who else? Somebody's got to be in charge till we get Superior back to\nEarth.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Bendy said, \"but you don't have to rig yourself up in ermine. I\nalso have a sneaking suspicion that you aren't exactly anxious to get\nSuperior down in a hurry.\"\n\n\"I'll overlook that remark for old time's sake. But I defend the\nkingship. A show of force was necessary to prevent crime from running\nrampant.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" Bendy said. \"Anyhow I appreciate your frankness in introducing\nus to Gizl and what he modestly describes as his meager knowledge. Since\nyou've already admitted that he's the one who provided the big feed,\nwill you ease Alis's mind now and assure her that what she was eating\nwasn't Negusburger?\"\n\n\"Negusburger?\" The king laughed. \"Is that what you thought, Alis?\"\n\n\"Not really,\" she said. \"But I couldn't help wondering where all the\nfood came from all of a sudden.\"\n\n\"Over here.\" The king led them to the corner where Gizl had sunk from\nsight. The top of the elevator, now level with the floor, blended\nexactly with the linoleum tile. \"I don't know how it works, but Gizl\nand his people have their headquarters down there somewhere. All I have\nto do is place the order and up comes food or whatever I need. Would you\nlike to try it?\"\n\n\"Love to,\" Bendy said. \"What shall I ask for?\"\n\n\"Anything.\"\n\n\"Anything?\"\n\n\"Anything at all.\"\n\n\"Well.\" Bendy looked impressed. \"This will take a moment of thought. How\nabout a gallon--no, as long as I'm asking I might as well ask for a\nkeg--of rum, 151 proof.\"\n\nUp it came, complete with spigot and tankard.\n\n\"Fabulous!\" Bendy said. He rolled it out of the elevator and the\nelevator went down again.\n\n\"Let me try!\" Alis said. \"If Doc can get a keg, I ought to be able to\nhave--oh, say a pint of Channel No. 5. Would that be too extravagant?\"\n\n\"A simple variation in formula, I should think,\" the king said.\n\nWhat came up for Alis didn't look in the least like an expensive Paris\nperfume. In fact, it looked like a lard pail with a quantity of liquid\nsloshing lazily in it. But its aroma belied its looks.\n\n\"Oh, heaven!\" Alis said. \"Smell it!\" She lifted it by its handle, stuck\na finger in it and rubbed behind each ear.\n\n\"It's a bit overpowering by the pint,\" Bendy said. He'd drained off part\nof a tankard of rum and looked quite at peace with the world. \"You'd\nbetter get yourself a chaperone, Alis, if you're going to carry that\naround with you.\"\n\n\"I'll admit they're not very good in the packaging department, but\nthat's just a quibble. Could I have--how many ounces in a pint?--sixteen\none-ounce stoppered bottles? And a little funnel?\"\n\n\"Easiest thing in the world,\" the king said. \"Don? Anything you'd like\nat the same time? Save it a trip.\"\n\n\"I've got an idea, Your Majesty, but I don't know whether you'd\napprove. Even though I work in a bank, I've never seen a ten thousand\ndollar bill. Do you think they could whip one up?\"\n\n\"I really don't know,\" Hector said. \"It could upset the economy if we\nlet the money get out of hand. But we can always send it right back.\nLet's see what happens.\"\n\nThe elevator came up with the bottles, the funnel and a green and gold\nbill.\n\nIt was, on the face of it, a ten thousand dollar bill. But the portrait\nwas that of Hector Civek, crowned and ermined. And the legend on it was:\n\n\"_Payable to Bearer on Demand, Ten Thousand Dollars. This Note is\nLegal Tender for all Debts, Public and Private, and is Redeemable in\nLawful Money at the Treasury of the Kingdom of Superior._ (Signed)\n_Gizl, Secretary of the Treasury._\"\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nDon didn't know what he might learn by skulking around the freezing\ngrounds of Hector's palace in the faint moonlight. He hoped for a\nglimpse of the kangaroo-Gizl to see if he were as sincere off-guard as\nhe had been during their interview.\n\nBut his peering into basement windows had revealed nothing, and he was\nabout to head back to the campus for a night's sleep when someone called\nhis name.\n\nIt was a girl's voice, from above. He looked up. Red-headed Geneva\nJervis was leaning out of one of the second-story windows.\n\n\"Well, hello,\" he said. \"What are you doing up there?\"\n\n\"I've sworn fealty,\" she said. \"Come on up.\"\n\n\"What?\" he said. \"How?\"\n\nShe disappeared from his sight, then reappeared. \"Here.\" She dropped a\nrope ladder.\n\nDon climbed it, feeling Like Romeo. \"Where'd you get this?\"\n\n\"They've got them in all the rooms. Fire escapes. Old McFerson was a\nprecautious man, evidently.\" She pulled the rope back in.\n\nJen Jervis had a spacious bedroom. She wore a dressing gown.\n\n\"What do you mean, you swore fealty?\" Don asked. \"To Hector?\"\n\n\"Sure. What better way to find out what he's up to? Besides, I was\ngetting fed up with that dormitory at Cavalier. No privacy. House\nmothers creeping around all the time. Want a drink?\"\n\nDon saw that she had a half-full glass on the dresser. Next to the glass\nstood a bottle of bourbon with quite a bit gone from it.\n\n\"Why not?\" he said. \"Let's drink and be merry, for tomorrow we may\nfreeze to death.\"\n\n\"Or be shot down by Reds.\" She poured him a stiff one. \"Here's to happy\nendings.\"\n\nHe sipped his drink and she swallowed half of hers.\n\n\"I didn't picture you as the drinking type, Jen.\"\n\n\"Revise the picture. Come sit down.\" She backed to the big double bed\nand relaxed into it, lying on one elbow.\n\nDon sat next to her, but upright. \"Tell me about this fealty deal. What\ndid you have to do?\"\n\n\"Oh, renounce my American citizenship and swear to protect Superior\nagainst all enemies, foreign and domestic. The usual thing.\"\n\n\"Have you got a title yet? Are you Dame Jervis?\"\n\n\"Not yet.\" She smiled. \"I think I'm on probation. They know I'm close to\nBobby and they'd like to have him on their side, for all their avowed\nindependence. They're not so terribly convinced that Superior's going to\nstay up forever. They're hedging their bets, it looks to me.\"\n\n\"It looks to me that maybe Bobby Thebold might not understand. He's the\nkind of man who demands absolute fealty, from what I've seen of him.\"\n\n\"Oh, to hell with Bobby Thebold.\" Jen took another swallow. \"He's not\nhere. He's had plenty of time to come, if he was going to, and he\nhasn't. To hell with him. Let me get you another drink.\"\n\n\"No, thanks. This will do me fine.\" He drank it and set the empty glass\non the floor. Jen drank off the last of hers and put her glass next to\nhis.\n\n\"Relax,\" she said. \"I'm not going to bite you.\" She lay back and her\ndressing gown opened in a V as far as the belt. She obviously wasn't\nwearing anything under the gown.\n\nDon looked away self-consciously.\n\nJen laughed. \"What's the matter, boy? No red blood?\" She rolled herself\noff the end of the bed and went to the dresser. \"Another drink?\"\n\n\"Don't you think you've had enough?\"\n\nShe shook her red hair violently. \"Drinking is as drinking does. Trouble\nis, nobody's doing anything.\"\n\n\"Exactly. Everybody's acting as if Superior's one big pleasure dome.\nCivek's on the throne and all's well with his little world. Even you've\njoined the parade. Why? I don't buy that double-agent explanation.\"\n\nShe was looking in the bureau mirror at the reflection of the top of her\nhead, peering up from under her eyebrows. \"I'm going to have to touch up\nthe tresses pretty soon or I won't be a redhead any more.\" She looked at\nhis reflection. \"You don't like me, do you, Donny-boy?\"\n\n\"I never said that.\"\n\n\"You don't have to say it. But I don't blame you. I don't like myself\nsometimes. I'm a cold fish. A cold, dedicated fish. Or I was. I've\ndecided to change my ways.\"\n\n\"I can see that.\"\n\n\"Can you?\" She turned around and leaned against the bureau, holding her\nglass. \"How do you see me now?\"\n\n\"As an attractive woman with a glass in her hand. I wonder which is\ndoing the talking.\"\n\n\"Rhetorical questions at this time of night, Donny? I think it's me\ntalking, not the whisky. We'll know better in the sober light of\nmorning, won't we?\"\n\n\"If that's an invitation,\" Don began, \"I'm afraid--\"\n\nHer eyes blazed at him. \"I think you're the rudest man I ever met. _And_\nthe most boorish.\" She tossed off the rest of her drink, then began to\ncry.\n\n\"Now, Jen--\" He went to her and patted her shoulder awkwardly.\n\n\"Oh, Don.\" She put her head against his chest and wept. His arms\nautomatically went around her, comfortingly.\n\nThen he realized that Jen's muffled sobs were going direct to the\nPentagon through his transceiver. That piece of electronics equipment\ntaped to his skin, he told himself, was the least of the reasons why he\ncould not have accepted Jen's invitation--if it had been an invitation.\n\nHe lifted her chin from his chest to spare the man in the Pentagon any\nfurther sobs, which must have been reaching him in crescendo. Jen's face\nwas tear-stained. She looked into his eyes for a second, then fastened\nher mouth firmly on his.\n\nThere was nothing a gentleman could do, Don thought, except return the\nkiss. Rude, was he?\n\nJen broke away first. \"What's that?\" she said.\n\nDon opened his eyes and his glance went automatically to the door. It\nwould not have surprised him to see King Hector coming through it in his\nroyal night clothes. But Jen was staring out the window. He turned.\n\nThe sky was bright as day over in the direction of the golf course. Don\nmade out a pinpoint of brighter light.\n\n\"It's a star shell,\" he said. \"A flare.\"\n\nThey went to the window and leaned out, looking past a corner of the\nbubble gum factory.\n\n\"What's it for?\" Jen asked.\n\nDon pointed. \"There. That's what for.\"\n\n\"A blimp!\" she said. \"It's landing!\"\n\n\"Is it an Air Force job? I can't make out the markings.\"\n\n\"I think I can,\" Jen said. \"They're--PP.\"\n\n\"Private Pilots! Senator Bobby the Bold!\"\n\nJen Jervis clutched his arm. \"S.O.B.!\" she whispered fiercely.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDon Cort was down the rope fire escape and away from the mansion before\nit woke up to the invasion. As he crossed the railroad spur he had a\nglimpse of Jen Jervis hauling up the rope and of lights going on\nelsewhere in the building. There was a lot of whistle-blowing and\nshouting and a lone shot which didn't seem to be aimed at him.\n\nDon waited at the spur, behind a boxcar, to see how the Hectorites would\nreact to the landing of the blimp, A few men gathered at the front gate\nand looked nervously into the sky and toward the golf course. Others\njoined them, armed with shotguns, pistols, and a rifle or two, but not\nwith King Hector's paralysis gadget.\n\nIt was clear that Hector had no intention of starting a battle. His men\napparently were under orders only to guard the mansion and the bubble\ngum factory. No one even went to see what the blimp was up to.\n\nDon found as he neared the golf course that the people from the blimp\napparently had no immediate plan to attack, either. He found a sand trap\nto lie down in. From it he could watch without being seen. The star\nshell had died out but he could see the blimp silhouetted against the\nsky. Men in battle dress were establishing a perimeter around the\nclubhouse. Each carried a weapon of some kind. It was all very dim.\n\nDon remembered his communicator. \"Cort here,\" he said softly. \"Do you\nread me?\"\n\n\"Affirmative,\" a voice said. Don didn't recognize it. He described the\nlanding and asked, \"Is this an authorized landing or is it Senator\nThebold's private party?\"\n\n\"Negative,\" said the voice from the Pentagon, irritatingly GI.\n\n\"Negative _what_?\" Don said. \"You mean Thebold _is_ leading it?\"\n\n\"Affirmative,\" said the voice.\n\n\"What's he up to?\" Don asked.\n\n\"Negative,\" the voice said.\n\nDon blew up. \"If you mean you don't know, why the hell don't you say so?\nWho is this, anyhow?\"\n\n\"This happens to be Major Johns, the O.O.D., Sergeant, and if you know\nwhat's good for you--\"\n\nDon stopped listening because a man in battle dress, apparently\nattracted by his voice, was standing on the green, looking down into the\nbunker where Don lay, pointing a carbine at him.\n\n\"I'll have to hang up now, Major,\" Don said quietly. \"Something negative\nhas just happened to me. I've been captured.\"\n\nThe man with the carbine shouted down to Don, \"Okay, come out with your\nhands over your head.\"\n\nDon did so. He hoped he was doing it affirmatively enough. He had no\nwish to be shot by one of the Senator's men, regardless of whether that\nman was authorized or unauthorized.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSenator Thebold sat at a desk in the manager's office of the Raleigh\nCountry Club. He wore a leather trench coat and a fur hat. Wing\ncommander's insignia glittered on his shoulders and a cartridge belt was\nbuckled around his waist. A holster hung from it but Thebold had the\nheavy .45 on the desk in front of it. He motioned to Don to sit down.\nTwo guards stood at the door.\n\n\"Name?\" Thebold snapped.\n\nDon decided to use his own name but pretend to be a local yokel.\n\n\"Donald Cort.\"\n\n\"What were you doing out there?\"\n\n\"I saw the lights.\"\n\n\"Who were you talking to in the sand trap?\"\n\n\"Nobody. I sometimes talk to myself.\"\n\n\"Oh, you do. Do you ever talk to yourself about a man named Osbert Garet\nor Hector Civek?\" Thebold looked at a big map of Superior that had been\npinned to the wall, thus giving Don the benefit of his strong profile.\n\n\"Hector's the king now,\" Don said. \"Things got pretty bad before that\nbut we got enough to eat now.\"\n\n\"Where did the food come from?\"\n\nDon shrugged.\n\nThebold drummed his fingers on the desk. \"You're not exactly a fount of\ninformation, are you? What do you do for a living?\"\n\n\"I used to work in the gum factory but I got laid off.\"\n\n\"Do you know Geneva Jervis?\"\n\n\"Who's he?\" Don said innocently.\n\nThebold stood up in irritation. \"Take this man to O. & I.,\" he said to\none of the guards. \"We've got to make a start some place. Are there any\nothers?\"\n\n\"Four or five,\" the guard said.\n\n\"Send me the brightest-looking one. Give this one and the rest a meal\nand a lecture and turn them loose. It doesn't look as if Civek is going\nto give us any trouble right away and there isn't too much we can do\nbefore daylight.\"\n\nThe guard led Don out of the room and pinned a button on his lapel. It\nsaid: _Bobby the Bold in Peace and War_.\n\n\"What's O. & I.?\" Don asked him.\n\n\"Orientation and Integration. Nobody's going to hurt you. We're here to\nend partition, that's all.\"\n\n\"End partition?\"\n\n\"Like in Ireland. Keep Superior in the U. S. A. They'll tell you all\nabout it at O. & I. Then you tell your friends. Want some more buttons?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDon was fed, lectured, and released, as promised.\n\nEarly the next morning, after a cup of coffee with Alis Garet at\nCavalier's cafeteria, he started back for the golf course. Alis, in a\nclass-cutting mood, went with him.\n\nThe glimpses of the Thebold Plan which Don had had from O. & I. were\nbeing put into practice. Reilly Street, which provided a boundary line\nbetween Raleigh Country Club and the gum-factory property, had been\ntransformed into a midway.\n\nThe Thebold forces had strung bunting and set up booths along the south\nside of the street. Hector's men, apparently relieved to find that the\nbattle was to be psychological rather than physical, rushed to prepare\nrival attractions on their side. A growing crowd thronged the center of\nReilly Street. Some wore Thebold buttons. Some wore other buttons, twice\nas big, with a smiling picture of Hector I on them. Some wore both.\n\nThe sun was bright but the air was bitingly cold. As a result one of the\nmost popular booths was on Hector's side of the street where Cheeky\nMcFerson was giving away an apparently inexhaustible supply of\nhand-warmers. Cheeky urged everybody to take two, one for each pocket,\nand threw in handfuls of bubble gum.\n\nTwo of Hector's men set up ladders and strung a banner across two\nstore-fronts. It said in foot-high letters: KINGDOM OF SUPERIOR, LAND OF\nPLENTY.\n\nA group of Thebold troubleshooters watched, then rushed away and\nreappeared with brushes and paint. They transformed an advertising sign\nto read, in letters two feet high: SUPERIOR, U.S.A., HOME OF THE FREE.\n\nHawkers on opposite sides of the midway vied to give away hot dogs,\nboiled ears of corn, steaming coffee, hot chocolate, candy bars, and\npopcorn.\n\n\"There's a smart one.\" Alis pointed to a sign in Thebold territory. _The\nGripe Room_ it said over a vacant store. The Senator's men had set up\ndesks and chairs inside and long lines had already formed.\n\nApparently a powerful complaint had been among the first to be\nregistered because a Thebold man was galvanized into action. He ran out\nof the store and within minutes the sign painters were at work again.\nTheir new banner, hoisted to dry in the sun, proclaimed: BLIMP MAIL.\n\nUnderneath, in smaller letters, it said: _How long since you've heard\nfrom your loved ones on Earth? The Thebold Blimp will carry your letters\nand small packages. Direct daily connections with U. S. Mail._\n\n\"You have to admire them,\" Alis said. \"They're really organized.\"\n\n\"One's as bad as the other,\" Don said. Impartially, he was eating a\nHector hot dog and drinking Thebold coffee. \"Have you noticed the guns\nin the upstairs windows?\"\n\n\"No. You mean on the Senator's side?\"\n\n\"Both sides. Don't stare.\"\n\n\"I see them now. Do you see any Gizl-sticks? The thing Hector used on\nNegus?\"\n\n\"No. Just conventional old rifles and shotguns. Let's hope nobody starts\nanything.\"\n\n\"Look,\" Alis said, grabbing Don by the arm. \"Isn't that Ed Clark going\ninto the Gripe Room?\"\n\n\"It sure is. Gathering material for another powerful editorial, I\nguess.\"\n\nBut within minutes Clark's visit had provoked another bustle of\nactivity. Two of Thebold's men dashed out of the renovated store and off\ntoward the country club. They came back with the Senator himself, making\nhis first public appearance.\n\nThebold strode down the center of the midway, wearing his soft aviator's\nhelmet with the goggles pushed up on his forehead and his silk scarf\nfluttering behind him. A group of small boys followed him, imitating\nhis self-confident walk and scrambling occasionally for the Thebold\nbuttons he threw to them. The Senator went into the Gripe Room.\n\n\"Looks as if Ed has wangled an interview with the great man himself,\"\nAlis said.\n\n\"You didn't say anything to Clark about our talk with the Gizl, did\nyou?\"\n\n\"I did mention it to him,\" Alis said. \"Was that bad?\"\n\n\"Half an hour ago I would have said no. Now I'm not so sure.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA speaker's platform had been erected on the Senator's side of Reilly\nStreet, and now canned but stirring band music was blaring out of a\nloudspeaker. Thebold came out of the Gripe Room and mounted the\nplatform. A fair-sized crowd was waiting to hear him.\n\nThebold raised his arms as if he were stilling a tumult. The music died\naway and Thebold spoke.\n\n\"My good friends and fellow Americans,\" the Senator began.\n\nThen a Hectorite sound-apparatus started to blare directly across the\nstreet. The sound of hammering added to the disruption as workmen began\nto set up a rival speaker's platform. Then the music on the north side\nof Reilly Street became a triumphal march and Hector I made his\nentrance.\n\nThebold spoke on doggedly. Don heard an occasional phrase through the\ndin. \"... reunion with the U. S. A. ... end this un-American, this\nliteral partition ...\"\n\nBut many in the crowd had turned to watch Hector, who was magnificent\nand warm-looking in his ermine robe.\n\n\"Loyal subjects of Superior, I exhort you not to listen to this outsider\nwho has come to meddle in our affairs,\" Hector said. \"What can he offer\nthat your king has not provided? You have security, inexhaustible food\nsupplies and, above all, independence!\"\n\nThebold increased his volume and boomed:\n\n\"Ah, but _do_ you have independence, my friends? Ask your puppet king\nwho provides this food--and for what price? And how secure _do_ you feel\nas you whip through the atmosphere like an unguided missile? You're over\nthe Atlantic now. Who knows at what second the controls may break down\nand dump us all into the freezing water?\"\n\nHector pushed his crown back on his head as if it were a derby hat. \"Who\nasked the Senator here? Let me remind you that he does not even\nrepresent our former--and I emphasize _former_--State of Ohio. We all\nknow him as a political adventurer, but never before has he attempted to\nmeddle in the affairs of another country!\"\n\n\"And you know what lies beyond Western Europe,\" Thebold said. \"Eastern\nEurope and Russia. Atheistic, communistic Red Russia. Is that where\nyou'd like to come down? For that's where you're heading under Hector\nCivek's so-called leadership. King Hector, he calls himself. Let me\nremind you, friends, that if there is anything the Soviet Russians hate\nmore than a democracy, it's a _monarchy_! I don't like to think what\nyour chances would be if you came down in Kremlinland. Remember what\nthey did to the Czars.\"\n\nThen Senator Bobby Thebold played his ace:\n\n\"But there's an even worse possibility, my poor misguided friends. And\nthat's for the creatures behind Hector Civek to decide to go back\nhome--and take off into outer space. Has Hector told you about the\ncreatures? He has not. Has he told you they're aliens from another\nplanet? He has not. Some of you have seen them--these kangaroo-like\ncreatures who, for their own nefarious purposes, made Hector what he is\ntoday.\n\n\"But, my friends, these are not the cute and harmless kangaroos that\nabound in the land of our friendly ally, Australia. No. These are\nintelligent alien beings who have no use for us at all, and who have\nbrazenly stolen a piece of American territory and are now in the process\nof making off with it.\"\n\nA murmur came from the crowd and they looked over their shoulders at\nHector, whose oratory had run down and who seemed unsure how to answer.\n\n\"Yes, my friends,\" Thebold went on, \"you may well wonder what your fate\nwill be in the hands of that power-mad ex-mayor of yours. A few thousand\nfeet more of altitude and Superior will run out of air. Then you'll\nreally be free of the good old U.S.A. because you'll be dead of\nsuffocation. That, my friends--\"\n\nAt that point somebody took a shot at Senator Bobby Thebold. It missed\nhim, breaking a second-story window behind him.\n\nImmediately a Thebold man behind that window smashed the rest of the\nglass and fired back across Reilly Street, over the heads of the crowd.\n\nPeople screamed and ran. Don grabbed Alis and pulled her away from the\nimmediate zone of fire. They looked back from behind a truck which,\nuntil a minute ago, had been dispensing hot buttered popcorn.\n\n\"Hostilities seem to have commenced,\" Alis said. She gave a nervous\nlaugh. \"I guess it's my fault for blabbing to Ed Clark.\"\n\n\"It was bound to happen, sooner or later,\" Don said. \"I hope nobody gets\nhurt.\"\n\nEvidently neither Thebold nor Hector personally had any such intention.\nBoth had clambered down from the platforms and disappeared. Most of the\ncrowd had fled too, heading east toward the center of town, but a few,\nlike Alis and Don, had merely taken cover and were waiting to see what\nwould happen next.\n\nSporadic firing continued. Then there was a concentration of shooting\nfrom the Senator's side, and a dozen or more of Thebold's men made a\nquick rush across the street and into the stores and buildings on the\nnorth side. In a few minutes they returned, under another protective\nburst, with prisoners.\n\n\"Slick,\" Don said. \"Hector's being outmaneuvered.\"\n\n\"I wonder why the Gizls aren't helping him.\"\n\nThe Thebold loudspeaker came to life. \"Attention!\" it boomed in the\nSenator's voice. \"Anyone who puts down his arms will be given safe\nconduct to the free side of Reilly Street. Don't throw away your life\nfor a dictator. Come over to the side of Americanism and common sense.\"\nThere was a pause, and the voice added: \"No reprisals.\"\n\nThe firing stopped.\n\nThe Thebold loudspeaker began to play _On the Sunny Side of the Street_.\n\nBut nobody crossed over. Nor was there any further firing from Hector's\nside.\n\n_Lay Down Your Arms_, the loudspeaker blared in another tune from\ntin-pan alley.\n\nWhen it became clear that Hector's forces had withdrawn completely from\nthe Reilly Street salient, Thebold's men crossed in strength.\n\nThey worked their way block by block to the grounds of the bubble gum\nfactory and proceeded to lay siege to it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith Hector Civek immobilized, Senator Bobby Thebold went looking for\nGeneva Jervis, accompanied by two armed guards.\n\nHe was trailed by the usual pack of small boys, several of them dressed\nin imitation of their hero, in helmets, silk-like scarves and toy guns\nat hips.\n\nAlis, unable to reach the besieged palace to see if her father was safe,\nhad asked Don to go back with her to Cavalier after the Battle of Reilly\nStreet. Her mother told Alis that the professor was not only safe on the\ncampus but had resigned his post as Royal Astronaut at Hector's court.\n\n\"Father broke with Hector?\" Alis asked. \"Good for him! But why?\"\n\n\"He and Dr. Rubach just up and walked out,\" Mrs. Garet said. \"That's all\nI know. Your father never explains these things to me. But if my\nintuition means anything, the professor is up to one of his tricks\nagain. He's been locked up in his lab all day.\"\n\nThe campus had an air of expectancy about it. Students and instructors\nwent from building to building, exchanging knowing looks or whispered\nconversations.\n\nA rally was in progress in front of the Administration Building when\nSenator Thebold arrived. Don and Alis joined the group of listeners for\ncamouflage and pretended to pay attention to what the speaker, an\nintense young man on the back of a pickup truck, was saying.\n\n\"The time has come,\" he said, \"for men and women of, uh, perspicacity to\nshun the extremes and tread the middle path. To avoid excesses as\nrepresented on the one hand by the, uh, paternalistic dictatorship of\nthe Hectorites, and on the other by the, uh, pseudo-democracy of Senator\nThebold which resorts to force when thwarted. I proclaim, therefore, the\ncourse of reason, the way of science and truth as exemplified by the,\nuh, the Garet-Rubach, uh--\"\n\nSenator Thebold had been listening at the edge of the little crowd. He\nspoke up.\n\n\"The Garet-Rubach Axis?\" he suggested.\n\nThe speaker gave him a cold stare. \"And who are you?\"\n\n\"Senator Robert Thebold, representing pseudo-democracy, as you call it.\nSpeak on, my young friend. Like Voltaire, I will defend to the\ndeath--but you know what Voltaire said.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" the speaker said, abashed. \"No offense intended, Senator.\"\n\n\"Of course you intended offense,\" Thebold said. \"Stick to your guns,\nman. Free academic discussion must never be curtailed. But at the moment\nI'm more interested in meeting your Professor Garet. Where is he?\"\n\n\"In--in the bell tower, sir. Right over there.\" He pointed. \"But you\ncan't go in. No one can.\" He looked at Alis as if for confirmation. She\nshook her head.\n\n\"We'll see about that,\" the Senator said. \"Carry on with your free and\nopen discussion. And remember, stick to your guns. Sorry I can't stay.\"\n\nHe headed for the bell tower, followed by his guards.\n\nAlis waited till he had gone in, then tugged at Don's sleeve. \"Come on.\nLet's see the fun.\"\n\n\"Alis,\" the speaker called to her, \"was that really Senator Thebold?\"\n\n\"Sure was. But what's this Garet-Rubach Axis? What's everybody up to?\"\n\n\"Not Axis. That was Thebold's propaganda word. It's a movement of--oh,\nnever mind. You don't appreciate your own father.\"\n\n\"You can say that again. Come on, Don.\"\n\nAs Alis closed the door to the bell tower behind them, they heard\nProfessor Garet's voice from above.\n\n\"Attention interlopers,\" it said. \"You have come unasked and now you\nfind yourself paralyzed, unable to move a muscle except to breathe.\"\n\n\"Stay down here,\" Alis whispered. \"There's a sort of vestibule one\nflight up. That's where Thebold must have got it. Father spends all his\nspare time guarding his holy of holies. Nobody gets past the vestibule.\"\nShe frowned. \"But I didn't know he had a paralysis thing, too.\"\n\n\"He probably swiped it from Hector before he broke with him,\" Don said.\n\nProfessor Garet's voice came again. \"I shall now pass among you and\nrelieve you of your weapons. Why, if it isn't Senator Thebold and his\nstrong-arm crew! I'm honored, Senator. Here we are: three archaic .45's\ndisposed of. Very soon now you'll have the pleasure of seeing a\nscientific weapon in action.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDon, standing with Alis on the steps of the Administration Building,\ndidn't know whether to be impressed or amused by the giant machine\nProfessor Garet had assembled. It was mounted on the flat bed of an old\nReo truck, and various parts of it went skyward in a dozen directions.\nGaret had driven it onto the campus from a big shed behind the bell\ntower.\n\nThe machine's crowning glory was a big bowl-shaped sort of thing that\ndidn't quite succeed in looking like a radar scanner. It was at the end\nof a universal joint which permitted it to aim in any direction.\n\n\"What's it supposed to do?\" Don asked.\n\n\"From what I gather,\" Alis said, \"it's Hector's paralysis thing, adapted\nfor distance. Only of course nobody admits Father stole it. It's\nsupposed to have antigravity powers, too, like whatever it was that took\nSuperior up in the first place. Naturally I don't believe a word of it.\"\n\n\"But where's he going with it?\"\n\n\"He's ready to take on all comers, I gather. Please don't try to make\nsense out of it. It's only Father.\"\n\nThe young man who had addressed the student rally took over the driver's\nseat and Professor Garet hoisted himself into a bucket seat at the rear\nof the truck near a panel which presumably operated the machine. Maynard\nRubach sat next to the driver. The small army of dedicated students who\nhad been assembling fell in behind the truck. They were unarmed, except\nwith faith.\n\nSenator Thebold and his two former bodyguards, de-paralyzed, sat trussed\nup in the back of a weapons carrier, looking disgusted with everything.\n\n\"Are we ready?\" Professor Garet called.\n\nA cheer went up.\n\n\"Then on to the enemy--in the name of science!\"\n\nDon shook his head. \"But even if this crazy machine could knock out\nHector's and Thebold's men and the Garet-Rubach Axis reigns supreme,\nthen what? Does he claim he can get Superior back to Earth?\"\n\nAlis said only, \"Please, Don ...\"\n\nThe forces of science were ready to roll. There had been an embarrassing\nmoment when the old Reo's engine died, but a student worked a crank\nwith a will and it roared back to life.\n\nThe Garet machine, the weapons carrier and the foot soldiers moved off\nthe campus and onto Shaws Road toward Broadway and the turn-off for the\ncountry club.\n\nThey met an advance party of the Thebold forces just north of McEntee\nStreet. There were about twenty of them, armed with carbines and\nsubmachine guns. As soon as they spotted the weird armada from Cavalier\nthey dropped to the ground, weapons aimed.\n\nSenator Thebold rose in his seat. \"Hold your fire!\" he shouted to his\nmen. \"We don't shoot women, children, or crackpots.\" He said to\nProfessor Garet, \"All right, mastermind, untie me.\"\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nA submarine surfaced on the Atlantic, far below Superior.\n\nIt was obvious to the commander of the submarine, which bore the\nmarkings of the Soviet Union, that the runaway town of Superior, being\npopulated entirely by capitalist madmen, was a menace to humanity. The\nsubmarine commander made a last-minute check with the radio room, then\ngave the order to launch the guided missiles which would rid the world\nof this menace.\n\nThe first missile sped skyward.\n\nSuperior immediately took evasive action.\n\nFirst, in its terrific burst of acceleration, everybody was knocked\nflat.\n\nNext, Superior sped upward for a few hundred feet and everybody was\ncrushed to the ground.\n\nAt the same time the first missile, which was now where Superior would\nhave been had it maintained its original course, exploded. A miniature\nmushroom cloud formed.\n\nThe submarine fired again and a second missile streaked up.\n\nSuperior dodged again. But this time its direction was down. Everyone\nwho was outdoors--and a few who had been under thin roofs--found himself\nmomentarily suspended in space.\n\nDon and Alis, among the hundreds who had had the ground snatched out\nfrom under them, clung to each other and began to fall. All around them\nwere the various adversaries who had been about to clash. Professor\nGaret had been separated from his machine and they were following\nseparate downward orbits. Many of Thebold's men had dropped their guns\nbut others clung to them, as if it were better to cling to something\nthan merely to fall.\n\nThe downward swoop of Superior had taken it out of the immediate path of\nthe second missile, but whoever had changed the townoid's course had\napparently failed to take the inhabitants' inertia into immediate\nconsideration. The missile was headed into their midst.\n\nThen two things happened. The missile exploded well away from the\nfalling people. And scores of kangaroo-like Gizls appeared from\neverywhere and began to snatch people to safety.\n\nGreat jumps carried the Gizls into the air and they collected three or\nfour human beings at each leap. The leaps appeared to defy gravity,\ncarrying the creatures hundreds of feet up. The Gizls also appeared to\nhave the faculty of changing course while airborne, saving their charges\nfrom other loose objects, but this might have been illusion.\n\nAt any rate, Geneva Jervis, who had been hurled up from the roof of\nHector's palace, where she had gone in hopes of catching a glimpse of\nSenator Thebold, was reunited with the Senator when they were rescued by\nthe same Gizl, whose leap had carried him in a great arc virtually from\none edge of Superior to the other.\n\nDon Cort, pressed close to Alis and grasped securely against the hairy\nchest of their particular rescuer, was experiencing a combination of\nsensations. One, of course, was relief at being snatched from certain\ndeath.\n\nAnother was the delicious closeness of Alis, who he realized he hadn't\nbeen paying enough attention to, in a personal way.\n\nAnother was surprise at the number of Gizls who had appeared in the\nmoment of crisis.\n\nFinally he saw beyond doubt that it was the Gizls who were running the\nentire show--that Hector I, Bobby the Bold, and the pseudo-scientific\nGaret-Rubach Axis were merely strutters on the stage.\n\nIt was the Gizls who were maneuvering Superior as if it were a giant\nvehicle. It was the Gizls who were exploding the missiles. And it was\nthe alien Gizls who, unlike the would-be belligerents among the\nEarth-people, were scrupulously saving human lives.\n\n\"Thanks,\" Don said to his rescuing Gizl as it set him and Alis down\ngently on the hard ground of the golf course.\n\n\"Don't mention it,\" the Gizl said, then leaped off to save others.\n\n\"He talked!\" Alis said.\n\nDon watched the Gizl make a mid-air grab and haul back a man who had\nlooked as if he might otherwise have gone over the edge. \"He certainly\ndid.\"\n\n\"Then that must have been a masquerade, that other time--all that\nmumbo-jumbo with the Anagrams.\"\n\n\"It must have been, unless they learn awfully fast.\"\n\nHe and Alis clutched each other again as Superior tilted. It remained\nsteady otherwise and they were able to see the ocean, whose surface was\nmarked with splashes as a variety of loose objects fell into it. Don had\na glimpse of Professor Garet's machine plummeting down in the midst of\nmost of Superior's vehicular population.\n\n\"There's a plane!\" Alis cried. \"It's going after something on the\nsurface.\"\n\n\"It's the Hustler,\" Don said. \"It's after the submarine.\"\n\nThe B-58's long pod detached itself, became a guided missile and hit the\nsubmarine square in the middle. There was a whooshing explosion, the\nB-58 banked and disappeared from sight under Superior, and the sub went\ndown.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Sergeant Cort,\" a voice said, and because Alis was lying with her head\non Don's chest she heard it first.\n\n\"Is that somebody talking to you, Don? Are you a sergeant?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid so,\" he said. \"I'll have to explain later. Sergeant Cort\nhere,\" he said to the Pentagon.\n\n\"Things are getting out of hand, Sergeant,\" the voice of Captain Simmons\nsaid.\n\n\"Captain, that's the understatement of the week.\"\n\n\"Whatever it is, we can't allow the people of Superior to be endangered\nany longer.\"\n\n\"No, sir. Is there another submarine?\"\n\n\"Not as far as we know. I'm talking about the state of anarchy in\nSuperior itself, with each of three factions vying for power. Four,\ncounting the kangaroos.\"\n\n\"They're not kangaroos, sir. They're Gizls.\"\n\n\"Whatever they are. You and I know they're creatures from some other\nworld, and I've managed to persuade the Chief of Staff that this is the\ncase. He's in seeing the Defense Secretary right now. But the State\nDepartment isn't buying it.\"\n\n\"You mean they don't believe in the Gizls?\"\n\n\"They don't believe they're interplanetary. Their whole orientation at\nState is toward international trouble. Anything interplanetary sends\nthem into a complete flap. We can't even get them to discuss the\nexploration of the moon, and that's practically around the corner.\"\n\n\"What shall we do, sir?\"\n\n\"Between you and me, Sergeant--\" Captain Simmons' voice interrupted\nitself. \"Never mind that now. Here comes the Defense Secretary.\"\n\n\"Foghorn Frank?\" Don asked.\n\n\"Sh.\"\n\nFrank Fogarty had earned his nickname in his younger years when he\ncommanded a tugboat in New York Harbor. That was before his quick rise\nin the shipbuilding industry where he got the reputation as a wartime\nexpediter that led to his cabinet appointment.\n\n\"Is this the gadget?\" Don heard Fogarty say.\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Okay. Sergeant Cort?\" Fogarty boomed. \"Can you hear me?\" It was no\nwonder they called him Foghorn.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Don said, wincing.\n\n\"Fine. You've been doing a topnotch job. Don't think I don't know what's\nbeen going on. I've heard the tapes. Now, son, are you ready for a\nlittle action? We're going to stir them up at State.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Don said again.\n\n\"Good. Then stand up. No, better not if Superior is still gyrating. Just\nraise your right hand and I'll give you a field promotion to major.\nTemporary, of course. I can do that, can't I, General?\"\n\nApparently the Chief of Staff was there, and agreed.\n\n\"Right,\" Fogarty said. \"Now, Sergeant, repeat after me....\"\n\nDon, too overwhelmed to say anything else, repeated after him.\n\n\"Now then, Major Cort, we're going to present the State Department with\nwhat they would call a _fait accompli_. You are now Military Governor of\nSuperior, son, with all the power of the U.S. Defense Establishment\nbehind you. A C-97 troop carrier plane is loading. I'll give you the\nETA as soon as I know it. A hundred paratroopers. Arrange to meet them\nat the golf course, near the blimp. And if Senator Thebold tries to\ninterfere--well, handle him tactfully. But I think he'll go along. He's\ngot his headlines and by now he should have been able to find his\nmissing lady friend. Help him in that personal matter if you can. As for\nHector Civek and Osbert Garet, be firm. I don't think they'll give you\nany trouble.\"\n\n\"But, sir,\" Don said. \"Aren't you underestimating the Gizls? If they see\nparatroops landing they're liable to get unfriendly fast. May I make a\nsuggestion?\"\n\n\"Shoot, son.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, I think I'd better go try to have a talk with them and see\nif we can't work something out without a show of force. If you could\nhold off the troops till I ask for them....\"\n\nFoghorn Frank said, \"Want to make a deal, eh? If you can do it, fine,\nbut since State isn't willing to admit that there's such a thing as an\nintelligent kangaroo, alien or otherwise, any little deals you can make\nwith them will have to be unofficial for the time being. All right--I'll\nhold off on the paratroopers. The important thing is to safeguard the\ncivilian population and uphold the integrity of the United States. You\nhave practically unlimited authority.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Secretary. I'll do my best.\"\n\n\"Good luck. I'll be listening.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"As I see it,\" Alis said after Don had explained his connection with the\nPentagon, \"Senator Thebold licked Hector Civek. Father, who defected\nfrom Hector, captured the Senator and vice versa. But now the Gizls have\ntaken over from everybody and you have to fight them--all by your\nlonesome.\"\n\n\"Not fight them,\" Don said. \"Negotiate with them.\"\n\n\"But the Gizls are on Hector's side. It seems to come full circle. Where\ndo you start?\"\n\nSuperior had returned to an even keel and Don helped her up. \"Let's\nstart by taking a walk over to the bubble gum factory. We'll try to see\nthe Gizl-in-Chief.\"\n\nThere didn't seem to be anyone on the grounds of the McFerson place. The\nboxcar which had been on the siding near the factory was gone. It was\nprobably at the bottom of the Atlantic by now, along with everything\nelse that hadn't been fastened down. Don wondered if Superior's\ngyrations had been strong enough to dislodge the train that had\noriginally brought him to town. The Pennsylvania Railroad wouldn't be\nhappy about that.\n\nThey saw no one in the mansion and started for the basement room in\nwhich they'd had their talk with the Gizl, passing through rooms where\nthe furniture had been knocked about as if by an angry giant. They were\nstopped en route by Vincent Grande, ex-police chief now Minister of\nDefense. \"All right, kids,\" he said, \"stick 'em up. Your Majesty,\" he\ncalled, \"look what I got.\"\n\nHector Civek, crownless but still wearing his ermine, came up the\nstairs. \"Put your gun away, Vince. Hello, Alis. Hello, Don. Glad to see\nyou survived the earthquake. I thought we were all headed for kingdom\ncome.\"\n\nVincent protested, \"This is that traitor Garet's daughter. We can hold\nher hostage to keep her father in line.\"\n\n\"Nuts,\" the king said. \"I'm getting tired of all this foolishness. I'm\nsure Osbert Garet is just as shaken up as we are. And that crazy\nSenator, too. All I want now is for Superior to go back where it came\nfrom, as soon as possible. And that's up to Gizl, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\"Have you seen him since the excitement?\" Don asked.\n\n\"No. He went down that elevator of his when the submarine surfaced. I\nguess his control room, or whatever it is that makes Superior go, is\ndown there. Let's take a look. Vince, will you put that gun away? Go\nhelp them clean up the mess in the kitchen.\"\n\nVincent Grande grumbled and went away.\n\nIn the basement room, Hector went to the corner and said, \"Hey! Anybody\ndown there?\"\n\nA deep voice said, \"Ascending,\" and the blue-gray kangaroo-like creature\nappeared. He stepped off the elevator section. \"Greetings, friends.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Hector said, \"I didn't know you could talk.\"\n\n\"Forgive my lack of frankness,\" Gizl said. \"Alis,\" he said, bowing\nslightly. \"Your Majesty.\"\n\n\"Frankly,\" Hector said, \"I'm thinking of abdicating. I don't think I\nlike being a figurehead. Not when everybody knows about it, anyhow.\"\n\n\"Major Cort,\" Gizl said.\n\nDon looked startled. \"What? How did you know?\"\n\n\"We have excellent communications. We thank your military for its\nassistance with the submarine.\"\n\n\"A pleasure. And we thank you and your people for saving us when we went\nflying.\"\n\n\"Mutuality of effort,\" Gizl said. \"I'll admit a dilemma ensued when the\nsubmarine attacked. But our obligation to safeguard human lives\noutweighed the other alternative--escape to the safety of space. Now\nsuppose we have our conference. You, Major, represent Earth. I, Rezar,\nrepresent the survivors of Gorel-zed. Agreed?\"\n\n\"Rezar?\" Don said. \"I thought your name was Gizl. And what's Gorel-zed?\"\n\n\"Little Marie Bendy called me Gizl,\" Rezar said. \"She couldn't pronounce\nGorel-zed. I'm afraid I haven't been entirely candid with you about a\nnumber of things. But I think I know you better now. I heard your\nconversation with Foghorn Frank.\"\n\nDon smiled. \"Do you mean you've been listening in ever since I strapped\non the transceiver?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" Rezar said. \"So recapitulation is unnecessary. But we Gizls,\nso-called, are still a mystery to you, of course. I suppose you'd like\nsome background. Where from, where to, when, and all that.\"\n\n\"I certainly would,\" Don said. \"So would everybody else, I imagine,\nespecially King Hector here, and Mr. Fogarty.\"\n\n\"By all means let us communicate on the highest level,\" Rezar said.\n\"First, where from, eh?\"\n\n\"Right. Are you listening, Mr. Secretary?\"\n\n\"I sure am,\" Fogarty said. \"What's more, son, you're being piped\ndirectly into the White House--and a few other places.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Rezar said. \"Now marvel at our saga.\"\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nThe end of a civilization is a tragic thing.\n\nOn the desert planet of Gorel-zed, the last world to survive the slow\nnova of its sun, the Gizls, once the pests but now through brain surgery\nthe possessors in their hardy bodies of the accumulated knowledge of the\nfrail human beings, were preparing to flee. Their self-supporting ships\nwere ready, capable of crossing space to the ends of the universe.\n\nBut their universe was barren. No planet could receive them. All were\ndoomed as was theirs, Gorel-zed. They set out for a new galaxy, knowing\nthey would not reach it but that their descendants might. They became\nnomads of space, self-sufficient.\n\nFor generations they wandered, their population diminishing. Their\nscientist-philosophers evolved the theory that accounted for their\nspaceborn ennui with life, their acceptance of their fate, their\neventual doom. They had no roots, no place of their own. They had only\nthe mechanistic world of their ships--which were vehicles, not a land.\nThey must find a home of their own, or die.\n\nSeveral times in their odyssey they had come to a planet which could\nhave housed them. But each time an injunction which had been built into\nthem at the time of the brain surgery prevented them from staying. The\ndoomed human beings on Gorel-zed had built into the very fiber of the\nGizls--who were, after all, only animals--the injunction that no human\nbeing could be harmed for their comfort.\n\nThis meant that the world of Ladnora, whose gentle saffron inhabitants\nwere incapable of offering resistance, could not be conquered. The\nLadnorans, in their generosity, had offered the refugees from Gorel-zed\na hemisphere of their own. But the Gizls required a world of their own,\nnot a half-world. They accepted a small continent only and made it\nspaceborne and took it with them.\n\nThe Crevisians were the next to be visited. They ruled a belt of fertile\nland around the equator of their world--the rest was icy waste. The\nGizls took a slice of each polar region and, joining them, made them\nspaceborne.\n\nIn time they reached the system of Sol.\n\nMars attracted them first because of its sands. Mars was like Gorel-zed\nin many ways. But that very resemblance meant it was not for them. Mars\nwas a dead world, as their own Gorel-zed had become.\n\nBut the next planet they came to was a green planet. The Gizls moored\nthe acquisitions in the asteroid belt and visited Earth.\n\nHere, at their planetfall, Australia, was the perfect land. Even its\ninhabitants--the great kangaroos, the smaller wallabies--breathed Home\nto the Gizls. But there were also the human beings who had made the land\ntheir own. And though memory of their origin had weakened in the Gizls,\nthe injunction had not.\n\nFor a time they set up a kind of camp in the great central desert and\nwith delight found their legs again. Out of the cramped ships they came,\nto bound in freedom and fresh breathable air across the wasteland. But\nhardy, naked, black human beings lived in the desert and they attacked\nthe Gizls with their primitive weapons. And when the Gizls fled, not\nwishing to harm them, they came to white men, who attacked them with\nexplosive weapons.\n\nAnd so they took to their ships and were spaceborne again. But the\nattraction of Earth was strong and they sought another continent, called\nNorth America.\n\nAnd in the center of it they found a great race whose technology was\nnearly as great as their own. These people had an intelligence and drive\nwhich rivaled that of their human antecedents, whose minds had been\ntransferred to the Gizl's hardy, cumbersome bodies.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRezar paused. His intelligent eyes seemed misplaced in his heavy animal\nbody.\n\n\"What attracted you to Superior, of all places?\" Alis asked.\n\nRezar seemed to smile. \"Two things. Cavalier and bubble gum.\"\n\n\"What?\" Alis said. \"You're kidding!\"\n\n\"No,\" Rezar said. \"It's true. Bubble gum because after generations of\nsubsistence on capsule food our teeth had weakened and loosened, and\nbubble gum strengthened them. Nourishment, no. Exercise, yes. And\nCavalier Institute because here were men who spoke in terms which\nparalleled the secret of our spacedrive.\"\n\nAlis laughed. \"This would make Father expire of joy,\" she said. \"But now\nyou know he's just a phony.\"\n\n\"Alas,\" Rezar said. \"Yes, alas. But he was so close. Magnology.\nCosmolineation. It's jargon merely, as we learned in time. Osbert Garet\nis mad. Harmless, but mad.\"\n\nDon asked Rezar, \"But if this built-in morality of yours is so strong,\nwhy didn't it prevent you from taking off with Superior?\"\n\nRezar replied, \"There are factions among us now. An evolution of a sort,\nI suppose. Nothing is static. One faction\"--he tapped his chest--\"is\ncompletely bound by the injunction. But in the other, self-preservation\nplaces a limit on the injunction.\"\n\nThe explanation seemed to be that the other faction, which grew in\nstrength with every failure to find a world of their own, felt that on a\nplanet such as Earth, with a history of men warring against men,\nrequired the Gizls to be no more moral than the human inhabitants\nthemselves.\n\n\"The Good Gizls versus the Bad Gizls?\" Alis asked.\n\nRezar seemed to smile. The Bad Gizls, led by one called Kaliz, had got\nthe upper hand for a time and elevated Superior, intending to join it to\nthe bits and pieces of other planets they had previously collected and\nstored in the asteroid belt. But Rezar's influence had persuaded them\nnot to head directly into space--at least not until they had solved the\nproblem of how to put Superior's inhabitants \"ashore\" first.\n\nDon, unaccustomed to his new role of interplanetary arbitrator, said\ntentatively:\n\n\"I can't authorize you to take Superior, even if you do put us all\nashore, but there must be a comparable piece of Earth we could let you\nhave.\"\n\n\"But Superior is not all,\" Rezar said. \"To use one of your nautical\nexpressions, Superior merely represents a shake-down cruise. Our ability\nto detach such a populated center had shown the feasibility of raising\nother typical communities--such as New York, Magnitogorsk and\nHeidelberg--each a different example of Earth culture.\"\n\nDon heard a gasp from the Pentagon--or it might have come from the White\nHouse.\n\n\"You mean you've burrowed under each one of those 'communities'?\" Don\nasked.\n\nRezar shrugged. \"Kaliz's faction,\" he said, as if to dissociate himself\nfrom the project of removing some of Earth's choicest property. \"They\naim at a history-museum of habitable worlds.\"\n\n\"Interplanetary souvenirs,\" Alis said. \"With quick-frozen inhabitants?\nDon, what are you going to do?\"\n\nDon didn't even know what to say. His eyes met Hector's.\n\n\"Don't look at me,\" Hector said. \"I definitely abdicate.\"\n\n\"Look,\" Don said to Rezar, \"how far advanced are these plans? I mean, is\nthere a deadline for this mass levitation?\"\n\n\"Twenty-four hours, your time,\" Rezar said.\n\n\"Can't you stop them? Aren't you the boss?\"\n\nThe alien turned Don's question back on him. \"Are _you_ the boss?\"\n\nDon had started to shake his head when Foghorn Frank's voice boomed out.\n\n\"Yes, by thunder, he _is_ the boss! Don, raise your right hand. I'm\ngoing to make you a brigadier general. No, blast it, a full general.\nRepeat after me....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGeneral Don Cort squared his shoulders. He was almost getting used to\nthese spot promotions.\n\n\"Now negotiate,\" Fogarty said. \"You hear me, Mr. Gizl-Rezar? The United\nStates of America stands behind General Cort.\" There was no audible\nobjection from the White House. \"Who stands behind you?\"\n\n\"A democratic government,\" Rezar said. \"Like yours.\"\n\n\"You represent them?\" Fogarty asked.\n\n\"With my council, yes.\"\n\n\"Then we can make a deal. Talk to him, Don. I'll shut up now.\"\n\nDon said to Rezar, \"Was it your decision to burrow under New York and\nMagnitogorsk and Heidelberg?\"\n\n\"I agreed to it, finally.\"\n\n\"But you agreed to it in the belief that the Earth-people were a warring\npeople and that your old prohibitions did not apply. But we are not a\nwarring people. Earth is at peace.\"\n\n\"Is it?\" Rezar asked sadly. \"Your plane warred on the submarine.\"\n\n\"In self-defense,\" Don said. \"Don't forget that we defended you, too.\nAnd we'd do it again--but not unless provoked.\"\n\nRezar looked thoughtful. He tapped his long fingernails on the table.\nFinally he said, \"I believe you. But I must talk to my people first, as\nyou have talked to yours. Let us meet later\"--he seemed to be making a\nmental calculation--\"in three hours. Where? Here?\"\n\n\"How about Cavalier?\" Alis suggested. \"It would be the first important\nthing that ever happened there.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor the first time since Superior took off, all of the town's elected or\nself-designated representatives met amicably. They gathered in the\ncommon room at Cavalier Institute as they waited for Rezar and his\ncouncil to arrive for the talks which could decide, not only the fate of\nSuperior, but of New York and two foreign cities as well.\n\nApparently the Pentagon expected Don to pretend he had authority to\nspeak for Russia and Germany as well as the United States. But could he\nspeak for the United States constitutionally? He was sure that Bobby\nThebold, comprising exactly one percent of that great deliberative body,\nthe Senate, would let him know if he went too far, crisis or no crisis.\n\nThe Senator, reunited with Geneva Jervis, sat holding her hand on a sofa\nin front of the fireplace in which logs blazed cheerfully. Thebold\nlooked untypically placid. Jen Jervis, completely sober and with her\nhair freshly reddened, had greeted Don with a cool nod.\n\nThebold had been chagrined at learning that Don Cort was not the yokel\nhe had taken him for. But he recovered quickly, saying that if there was\nany one thing he had learned in his Senate career it was the art of\ncompromise. He would go along with the duly authorized representative of\nthe Pentagon, with which he had always had the most cordial of\nrelations.\n\n\"Isn't that so, sweetest of all the pies?\" he said to Jen Jervis.\n\nJen looked uncomfortable. \"Please, Bobby,\" she said. \"Not in public.\"\nThe Senator squeezed her hand.\n\nProfessor Garet, whose wife and daughter were serving tea, stood with Ed\nClark near the big bay window, through which they looked occasionally to\nsee if the Gizls were coming. Maynard Rubach sat in a leather armchair\nnext to Hector Civek, who had discarded his ermine and wore an old heavy\ntweed suit. Doc Bendy sat off in a corner by himself. He was untypically\nquiet.\n\nDon Cort, despite his four phantom stars, was telling himself he must\nnot let these middle-aged men make him feel like a boy. Each of them had\nhad a chance to do something positive and each had failed.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" Don said, \"my latest information from Washington confirms\nthat the Gizls have actually tunneled under the cities they say their\nmilitant faction wants to take up to the asteroid belt, just as they dug\nin under Superior before it took off. So they're not bluffing.\"\n\n\"How'd we find out about Magnitogorsk?\" Ed Clark asked. \"Iron curtain\ngetting rusty?\"\n\nDon told him that the Russians, impressed by the urgency of an\nunprecedented telephone call from the White House to the Kremlin, had\nfinally admitted that their great industrial city was sitting on top of\na honeycomb. The telephone conversation had also touched delicately on\nthe subject of the submarine that had been sunk in mid-Atlantic, and\nthere had been tacit agreement that the sub commander had exceeded his\nauthority in firing the missiles and that the sinking would not be\nreferred to again.\n\nMaynard Rubach turned away from the window. \"Here they come. Three of\nthem. But they're not coming from the direction of the McFerson place.\"\n\n\"They could have come up from under the grandstand.\" Don said. \"Miss\nJervis and I found one of their tunnels there. Remember, Jen?\"\n\nJen Jervis colored slightly and Don was sorry he'd brought it up. \"Yes,\"\nshe said. \"I fainted and Don--Mr. Cort--General Cort--helped me.\"\n\n\"I'm obliged to the general,\" Senator Thebold said.\n\nProfessor Garet went to the door. The three Gizls followed him into the\nroom. Everyone stood up formally. There was some embarrassed scurrying\naround because no one had remembered that the Gizls required backless\nchairs to accommodate their tails.\n\nThe Gizls, looking remarkably alike, sat close together. Don tentatively\naddressed the one in the middle.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"first it is my privilege to award to you in the\nname of the President, the Medal of Merit in appreciation of your quick\naction in saving uncounted lives during the submarine incident. The\nactual medal will be presented to you when we re-establish physical\ncontact with Earth.\"\n\nRezar, who, it turned out, was the one in the middle, accepted with a\ngrave bow. \"Our regret is that we were unable to prevent the loss of\nmany valuable objects as well,\" he said.\n\n\"Mr. Rezar,\" Don said, \"I haven't been trained in diplomacy so I'll\nspeak plainly. We don't intend to give up New York. Contrary to general\nbelief, there are about eight million people who _do_ want to live\nthere. And I'm sure the inhabitants of Heidelberg and Magnitogorsk feel\nthe same way about their cities.\"\n\n\"Then you yield Superior,\" Rezar said.\n\n\"I didn't say that.\"\n\n\"Yield Superior and we will guarantee safe passage to Earth for all its\ninhabitants. We only want its physical facilities.\"\n\n\"We'll yield the bubble gum factory to help your dental problem--for\nsuitable reparations,\" Don said.\n\n\"Payment will be made for anything we take. Give us Superior intact,\nincluding the factory and Cavalier Institute, and we will transport to\nany place you name an area of equal size from the planet Mars.\"\n\n\"Mars?\" Don said. \"That'd be a very valuable piece of real estate for\nthe researchers.\"\n\n\"Take it,\" Don heard Frank Fogarty say from the Pentagon.\n\nProfessor Garet spoke up. \"If Cavalier goes, I go with it. I won't leave\nit.\"\n\n\"And I won't leave you, Osbert,\" his wife said. \"Will there be air up\nthere among the asteroids?\"\n\n\"We are air-breathers like you,\" Rezar said. \"When we have assembled our\nplanet there will be plenty. You will be welcome, Professor and Mrs.\nGaret.\"\n\n\"Hector?\" Don said. \"You're still mayor of Cavalier. What do you think?\"\n\n\"They can have it,\" Hector said. \"I'll take a nice steady civil service\njob with the Federal Government, if you can arrange it.\"\n\n\"Hector,\" Ed Clark said, \"I think that sums up why you've never been a\nhowling success in politics. You don't give a damn for the people. All\nyou care about is yourself.\"\n\nHector shrugged. \"You needn't be so holy-sounding, Eddie-boy,\" he said.\n\"Why isn't the _Sentry_ out this week? I'll tell you why. Because you've\nbeen so busy filing to the Trimble-Grayson papers on Thebold's private\nradio that you haven't had time for anything else. How much are they\npaying you?\"\n\nEd Clark, deflated, muttered, \"News is news.\"\n\n\"Is that what you were doing in Senator Thebold's Gripe Room on the\nmidway?\" Don asked Clark. \"Making this deal?\"\n\n\"Now, General,\" Thebold said. \"Would you deprive the people of their\nright to know? Throughout my Senate career I have carried the torch\nagainst government censorship, which is the path to a totalitarian\nstate.\"\n\n\"I'm sure part of the deal was that Clark's copy didn't make you\nanything less than a hero,\" Don said.\n\n\"Don't be too righteous, young man,\" Thebold said. \"'Lest ye be\njudged,' as they say. Are you not at this moment bargaining away a piece\nof a sovereign State of the sovereign United States? I don't happen to\nrepresent Ohio, but if I did I would rise in the upper chamber to demand\nyour court-martial.\"\n\n\"At ease, Senator!\" Don ordered. \"You're not in the upper chamber now.\nYou're on an artificial satellite which at any moment is apt to take off\ninto outer space.\"\n\nDoc Bendy spoke for the first time: \"Oops-a-daisy! You tell 'im,\nDonny-boy. Soo-perior--the town everybody looks up to.\"\n\nDon frowned at him. Bendy had sunk deep into his chair in his corner. He\nacknowledged Don's look with a broad smile that vanished in a hiccup.\n\n\"Y' don't have to say it, Donny. I been drinkin'. Ever since Superior\nlooped the looperior and flung me feet over forehead into the bee-yond.\nShatterin' experience to have nothin' but a kangaroo-hop between you and\neternity. Yop, ol' Bendy's been on a bender ever since. But you carry\non, boy. Y' doin' a great job.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Don said in irony. \"I guess that completes the roster of those\nqualified to speak for Superior. Oh, I'm sorry, Dr. Rubach. Did you have\nsomething to say?\"\n\nBut all the portly president of Cavalier had to say, though he said it\nat great length, was that if Cavalier were taken as part of a package\ndeal, its trustees would have to receive adequate compensation.\nProfessor Garet tugged at his sleeve and said, \"Sit down, Maynard.\nThey've already said they'll pay.\"\n\nFogarty's voice rumbled at Don: \"Let's try to speed things up, General.\nClose the deal on Superior, at least, before the press get there.\"\n\n\"The press?\"\n\n\"The rest of the papers couldn't let the Trimble-Grayson chain keep\ntheir exclusive. Clark's going to have lots of company soon. The boys\nhave hired a vertiplane. First one off the assembly line. You've seen\nit. Lands anywhere.\"\n\n\"Okay, I'll try to hurry it up.\" To the Gizls Don said, \"All right. You\ntake Superior, minus its people, and bring us a piece of Mars.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" Rezar said. It was as easy as that. Nobody objected. Too many\nof Superior's self-proclaimed saviors had been caught with their motives\nshowing.\n\n\"You've got to give up New York, though,\" Don said. He felt as if he\nwere playing a game of interplanetary Monopoly. \"Well give you a chunk\nof the great central desert instead, if Australia's willing. (Would that\ncome under the South East Asia Treaty Organization, Mr. Secretary?)\nComplete with kangaroos and assorted wallabies, if you want them.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" said Rezar.\n\nDon sighed quietly to himself. It should be smooth sailing now that the\nhurdle of New York was past.\n\nBut Kaliz, the one Alis had called the Bad Gizl, shook his head\nviolently and spoke for the first time. \"No,\" he said firmly. \"We must\nhave New York. It is by far the greatest of our conquests and I will not\nyield it.\"\n\nRezar said sharply, \"We have foresworn conquest.\"\n\n\"I am tired of your moralizing,\" Kaliz said. \"We are dealing with beings\nwhose greatest respect is for power. If we temporize now we will lose\ntheir respect. They will think our new world weak and itself open to\nconquest. We have the power--let us use it. I say take New York _and_\nits people and hold them hostage. The city is ready for lifting.\"\n\n\"No!\" Don said. \"You can't have New York.\"\n\nKaliz seemed to smile. \"We already have it. It's merely a question of\ntransporting it.\" He put a long-fingered hand to his furry chest where,\nalmost hidden in the blue-gray fur, was a flat perforated disk. He said\ninto it, \"Show them that New York is ours!\"\n\n\"Wait!\" Rezar said.\n\n\"Merely a demonstration,\" Kaliz told him, \"for the moment at least.\"\n\nFrank Fogarty's voice, alarmed, said urgently, \"Tell him we believe him.\nNew York's reporting an earthquake, or something very like it. For God's\nsake tell him to put it back while we reorient our thinking.\"\n\nKaliz nodded in satisfaction. \"The city is as it was. Our people under\nNew York raised it a mere fraction of an inch. It could as easily have\nbeen a mile. Do not underestimate our power.\"\n\nRezar was agitated. \"We came in peace,\" he said to his fellow Gizl. \"Let\nus not leave in war. There's power on both sides, capable of untold\ndestruction. Neither must use it. We are a democratic people. Let us\nvote. I say we must not take New York.\"\n\n\"And I say we must,\" Kaliz told him, \"in self-interest.\"\n\nThey turned to the third of their people, who had been looking from one\nto the other, his eyes reflecting indecision.\n\nKaliz barked at him: \"Well, Ezial? Vote!\"\n\nEzial said, \"I abstain.\"\n\nDeadlock.\n\nDon was sweating. He looked at the others in the room. They were tense\nbut silent, apparently willing to leave it up to Don and his link with\nthe Defense Department.\n\nFrank Fogarty's voice said:\n\n\"SAC has been airborne in total strength for half an hour, General. It\nwas a purely precautionary alert at the time.\"\n\nDon started to interrupt.\n\n\"I know they hear me,\" the Secretary of Defense said. \"I intend that\nthey should. We don't want to fight but we will if we must. Son ...\" The\nrough voice faltered for a moment. \"If necessary, we'll destroy Superior\nto kill this alien and save New York. As a soldier, I hope you\nunderstand. It's the lives of three thousand people against the lives of\neight million.\"\n\nOnly Don and the Gizl had heard. Don looked across the room and into\nAlis' eyes. She gave him a tentative smile, noting his grave expression.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Don said finally.\n\nRezar spoke. \"This is folly.\" He touched the disk in the fur of his own\nchest.\n\n\"No!\" Kaliz cried.\n\n\"It is time,\" Rezar said. \"We are beginning to fail in our mission.\" He\nspoke reverently into the disk, \"My lord, awake.\"\n\nKaliz said quickly, \"Raise New York! Take it up!\"\n\n\"They will not obey you now,\" Rezar said. \"I have invoked the counsel of\nthe Master.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe man was frail and incredibly old. He had sparse white hair and a\ndeeply lined face, but his eyes were alert and wise. He wore a\ncloak-like garment of soft, warm-looking material. His expression was\none of kindliness but strength.\n\nThe doorbell had rung and Mrs. Garet had answered it. The old man had\nwalked slowly into the room, followed respectfully by two Gizls.\n\n\"My lord,\" said Rezar. He got to his feet and bowed, as did the other\nGizls. \"I had hoped to let you sleep until your new world had been\nprepared for you. But the risk was great that, if I delayed, your world\nwould never be. Forgive me.\"\n\n\"You did well,\" the old man said.\n\nDon stood up too, feeling the sense of awe that this personage inspired.\n\"How do you do, sir,\" he said.\n\n\"How do you do, General Cort.\"\n\n\"You know my name?\"\n\n\"I know many things. Too many for such a frail old body. But someone had\nto preserve the heritage of our people, and I was chosen.\"\n\n\"Won't you sit down, sir?\"\n\n\"I'll stand, thanks. I've rested long enough. Generations, as a matter\nof fact. Shall I answer some of your obvious questions? I'd better say a\nfew things quickly, before Foghorn Frank hits the panic button.\"\n\nDon smiled. \"Can he hear you or shall I repeat everything?\"\n\n\"Oh, he hears me. I've got gadgets galore, even though I'm between\nplanets at the moment. I must say it's a pleasure to be among people\nagain.\" He nodded pleasantly around the room.\n\nMrs. Garet smiled to him. \"Would you like a cup of tea?\"\n\n\"Later, perhaps, thank you. First I must assure you and everyone of\nEarth that no one will be harmed by us and that we want nothing for our\nnew world that you are not willing to give.\"\n\n\"That's good to hear,\" Don said. \"I gather you've been in some kind of\nsuspended animation since you left your old world. So I wonder how\nyou're able to speak English.\"\n\n\"Everything was suspended but the subconscious. That kept perking along,\nabsorbing everything the Gizls fed into it. And they've been absorbing\nyour culture for ten years, so I'm pretty fluent. And I certainly know\nenough to apologize for all the inconvenience my associates have caused\nyou in their zeal to re-establish the human race of Gorel-zed. In the\ncase of Kaliz, of course, it was excessive zeal which will necessitate\nhis rehabilitation.\"\n\n\"Your pardon, Master,\" Kaliz said humbly.\n\n\"Granted. But you'll be rehabilitated anyway.\"\n\nDon asked, \"Did I understand you to say you plan to re-establish your\nrace? Do you mean there are more of you, aside from the\nkangaroo-people?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. Young people. The youngest of all from Gorel-zed. They were\nput to sleep like me, to be ready to carry on when their new world is\nbuilt. I won't wake them till then. I hope to live that much longer.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you will, sir.\"\n\n\"Kind of you. But let's get on with the horse trading. Of course we\nwon't take New York, or the two other cities.\" (There was a collection\nof sighs of relief from Washington.) \"But we would like some of your\nuninhabited jungle land--the lusher the better, to help us out in the\noxygen department. We'd also like some of your air, if you can spare\nit. We've got a planet to supply now, not just ships.\"\n\n\"How would you get air across space?\" Don asked.\n\n\"At the moment,\" the Master said, \"I'm afraid we're not prepared to\nbarter our scientific knowledge.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean to pry. It just didn't seem to be something you could do.\nDo you think we could spare some air, Mr. Secretary?\"\n\n\"I'll have to ask the science boys about that one,\" Frank Fogarty said.\n\"Meanwhile it's okay with Australia on the desert. But your Gizl friends\nhave to agree to relocate the aborigines from that tract, and they must\ntake every last rabbit or it's no deal.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" the Master said with a smile. \"But please ask their stockmen\nto hold their fire. My friends only _look_ like kangaroos.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs Don and the Master were making arrangements for Superior to touch\ndown so its people could be transferred to Earth, a blaze of light\nstabbed down from the sky. Through the window they saw the vertiplane\nsettling slowly to the campus.\n\n\"It sure beats a blimp,\" Senator Thebold said in admiration.\n\nProfessor Garet got up to look. \"It's the press,\" he said to his wife.\n\"You might as well invite them in. I hope we have enough tea.\"\n\nThe vertiplane's door opened and the first wave of reporters spilled\nout.\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\n\nAs Superior headed back across the Atlantic, the Earth-people were given\na farewell tour. For the first time they had an authorized look at the\nunderground domain of the Gizls, which they reached through the tunnel\nthat led below from under Cavalier's grandstand.\n\nThe observation room which Don and Jen Jervis had found was connected by\na hidden elevator to a vast main chamber. A control console formed the\nentire wall of one end of it. Half a dozen Gizls stood at the base of\nthe console. From time to time one of them would launch himself upward\nwith his powerful legs, grab a protruding rung, make an adjustment, then\ndrop lightly back to the floor.\n\nDon and Alis stood for a moment watching Professor Garet, who was\ntugging at his beard as he became aware of the magnitude of the\noperation which drove Superior through the skies and was soon to take it\nacross space to the asteroid belt.\n\n\"Poor Father,\" Alis whispered to Don. \"Magnology in action, after all\nthese years--and he didn't have a thing to do with it.\"\n\n\"Is that why he wants to go with the Master?\"\n\n\"I imagine so. If he stayed on Earth he'd have nothing. He's too old to\nstart again. It's kind of them to take him--and Mother. In a way, I\nsuppose, his going is justification for his years of work. He'll at\nleast be close to the things he might have developed in the right\ncircumstances.\"\n\n\"He certainly won't be lonely,\" Don said. \"Have you noticed the rush to\nemigrate? Cheeky McFerson's decided to stick with his bubble gum\nfactory. He says the Gizls are a ready-made market. He saw one of them\ncram five Super-Bubs into his mouth, at one time. That's twenty-five\ncents right there.\"\n\nAlis giggled. \"And half of the student body of Cavalier wants to go.\nYou'd think they'd be disillusioned with Father, but they're not. I\nguess they had to be crazy to enroll in the first place.\"\n\n\"Senator Thebold's started campaigning to be named U.S. Ambassador to\nSuperior. I heard him talking to the man from the _New York Times_. I\nsuspect they'll give it to him--they'll need his influence to get Senate\napproval of the treaty with the Gizls.\"\n\n\"I had a little talk with Jen Jervis,\" Alis said. \"She's radiant, have\nyou noticed? The Senator finally asked her to marry him. That's all that\nwas the matter with her--Bobby the Bold had left her hanging by her\nthumbs too long.\"\n\n\"I guess he did.\" Don sought a way to get the conversation away from Jen\nJervis. \"Where's Doc Bendy? He certainly turned out to be a\ndisappointment.\"\n\n\"Poor Doc!\" Alis said. \"He's always the first to form a committee. But\nthen his enthusiasm wears off and he goes back to the bottle. Only now\nhe's got a keg.\"\n\nDon snapped his fingers. \"The keg. I almost forgot about that matter\nduplicator. If it can give you perfume and Doc rum.... Come on. Let's\nreopen negotiations with the Master.\"\n\nThey found the old man surrounded by a group of reporters, being\ncharmingly evasive with the science editor of _Time_. Professor Garet\nhad now joined this group, where he listened as eagerly as a student.\n\nThe Master was showing the vault-like chamber in which he had spent the\ngenerations since the spaceships left Gorel-zed. He let them examine the\ncoffin-sized drawer that had been his bed and indicated the others where\nthe younger ones still slept, awaiting the birth of their new planet.\nDon counted fewer than three dozen drawers.\n\n\"Is that all?\" he asked.\n\n\"Infants and children take up less room,\" the Master said. \"There are\ntwo or three in each drawer, and still others in the ships that never\ncome to Earth. Even so, we number fewer than a thousand.\"\n\n\"But you have the matter duplicator,\" Don said. \"Won't it work on\npeople?\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, no. Transubstantiation has never worked on living cells.\nDon't think we haven't tried. We shall have to encourage early marriages\nand hope for a high birth rate.\"\n\n\"Now about this transubstantiator,\" the _Time_ man said, and Garet's\nhead cocked in delight, apparently at the resounding sound of the word.\n\"What's the principle? You don't have to give away the secret--just give\nme a general idea.\"\n\nThe Master shook his head.\n\nDon asked, \"What will you trade for the transubstantiator and the\nparalysis scepter you gave Hector?\"\n\nThe old man smiled. \"Not even New York,\" he said. \"Our moral code\ncouldn't permit us to trade either. Earth has enough problems already.\"\n\n\"Offer him the formula for fusion,\" Frank Fogarty's voice said from the\nPentagon.\n\nThe old man shuddered. \"I heard that,\" he said. \"No, thank you, Mr.\nSecretary!\"\n\n\"This is the _clean_ bomb,\" Fogarty said. \"It ought to come in very\nhandy in construction work on your new planet.\"\n\n\"We will try to manage in our own way,\" the Master said. He asked Garet,\n\"Wouldn't you say that magnology was sufficient for our purposes,\nProfessor?\"\n\nAlis' father beamed at being consulted and hearing his own term applied\nto the Gorel-zed propulsion system.\n\n\"More than sufficient,\" he said enthusiastically. \"Preferable, in fact.\nMagnology is safe, stressless, and permanently powerful in stasis. It is\nthe ultimate in gravity-beam nullification. If anything can glue the\nasteroids back into the planet they once were, magnology will do it. You\ncan understand how I was misled. Your system so fitted my theory that I\nimagined it was I who had caused Superior to rise from Earth.\"\n\n\"I understand perfectly,\" the Master replied graciously. \"And I cannot\nsay how glad I am that you and Mrs. Garet have chosen to stay with\nCavalier and Superior and become citizens of our new world.\"\n\n\"What will you call your new planet?\" the AP man asked. \"Asteroida?\nSomething like that?\"\n\n\"We haven't decided. I welcome suggestions.\"\n\nThe UPI man was inspired. \"How about Neworld?\" he asked. \"That describes\nit perfectly, doesn't it? New world--Neworld?\" He wrote it on a piece of\npaper and admired it.\n\n\"Thank you,\" the Master said. \"Well certainly consider it.\"\n\nThe UPI man was satisfied. He had a lead for his story.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_SUPERIOR, Nov. 6 (AP)--The floating city of Superior, Earthbound again\nafter nearly six days of aerial meandering, prepared today to discharge\nits former residents.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
