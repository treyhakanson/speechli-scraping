Roy Walton had the power to enforce those\nmeasures. But though his job was in the service of humanity, he soon\nfound himself the most hated man in the world.\n\nFor it was _his_ job to tell parents their children were unfit to live;\n_he_ had to uproot people from their homes and send them to remote\nareas of the world. Now, threatened by mobs of outraged citizens,\ndenounced and blackened by the press, Roy Walton had to make a\ndecision: resign his post, or use his power to destroy his enemies,\nbecome a dictator in the hopes of saving humanity from its own folly.\nIn other words, should he become the MASTER OF LIFE AND DEATH?\n\n\n\n\nCAST OF CHARACTERS\n\n\nROY WALTON\n\nHe had to adopt the motto--_the ends justify the means_.\n\n\nFITZMAUGHAM\n\nHis reward for devoted service was--an assassin's bullet.\n\n\nFRED WALTON\n\nHis ambition was to fill his brother's shoes--but he underestimated\ntheir size.\n\n\nLEE PERCY\n\nHis specialty was sugarcoating bitter pills.\n\n\nPRIOR\n\nWith the pen as his only weapon, could he save his son?\n\n\nDR. LAMARRE\n\nHe died for discovering the secret of immortality.\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nThe offices of the Bureau of Population Equalization, vulgarly known\nas Popeek, were located on the twentieth through twenty-ninth floors\nof the Cullen Building, a hundred-story monstrosity typical of\ntwenty-second-century neo-Victorian at its overdecorated worst. Roy\nWalton, Popeek's assistant administrator, had to apologize to himself\neach morning as he entered the hideous place.\n\nSince taking the job, he had managed to redecorate his own office--on\nthe twenty-eighth floor, immediately below Director FitzMaugham's--but\nthat had created only one minor oasis in the esthetically repugnant\nbuilding. It couldn't be helped, though; Popeek was unpopular, though\nnecessary; and, like the public hangman of some centuries earlier, the\nBureau did not rate attractive quarters.\n\nSo Walton had removed some of the iridescent chrome scalloping that\ntrimmed the walls, replaced the sash windows with opaquers, and changed\nthe massive ceiling fixture to more subtle electroluminescents. But the\nmark of the last century was stamped irrevocably on both building and\noffice.\n\nWhich was as it should be, Walton had finally realized. It was the last\ncentury's foolishness that had made Popeek necessary, after all.\n\nHis desk was piled high with reports, and more kept arriving via\npneumochute every minute. The job of assistant administrator was\na thankless one, he thought; as much responsibility as Director\nFitzMaugham, and half the pay.\n\nHe lifted a report from one eyebrow-high stack, smoothed the crinkly\npaper carefully, and read it.\n\nIt was a despatch from Horrocks, the Popeek agent currently on duty in\nPatagonia. It was dated _4 June 2232_, six days before, and after a\nlong and rambling prologue in the usual Horrocks manner it went on to\nsay, _Population density remains low here: 17.3 per square mile, far\nbelow optimum. Looks like a prime candidate for equalization._\n\nWalton agreed. He reached for his voicewrite and said sharply, \"Memo\nfrom Assistant Administrator Walton, re equalization of ...\" He paused,\npicking a trouble-spot at random, \"... central Belgium. Will the\nsection chief in charge of this area please consider the advisability\nof transferring population excess to fertile areas in Patagonia?\nRecommendation: establishment of industries in latter region, to ease\ntransition.\"\n\nHe shut his eyes, dug his thumbs into them until bright flares of light\nshot across his eyeballs, and refused to let himself be bothered by\nthe multiple problems involved in dumping several hundred thousand\nBelgians into Patagonia. He forced himself to cling to one of Director\nFitzMaugham's oft-repeated maxims, _If you want to stay sane, think of\nthese people as pawns in a chess game--not as human beings._\n\nWalton sighed. This was the biggest chess problem in the history of\nhumanity, and the way it looked now, all the solutions led to checkmate\nin a century or less. They could keep equalizing population only so\nlong, shifting like loggers riding logs in a rushing river, before\ntrouble came.\n\nThere was another matter to be attended to now. He picked up the\nvoicewrite again. \"Memo from the assistant administrator, re\nestablishment of new policy on reports from local agents: hire a staff\nof three clever girls to make a pr\u00e9cis of each report, eliminating\nirrelevant data.\"\n\nIt was a basic step, one that should have been taken long ago. Now,\nwith three feet of reports stacked on his desk, it was mandatory. One\nof the troubles with Popeek was its newness; it had been established so\nsuddenly that most of its procedures were still in the formative stage.\n\nHe took another report from the heap. This one was the data sheet of\nthe Zurich Euthanasia Center, and he gave it a cursory scanning. During\nthe past week, eleven substandard children and twenty-three substandard\nadults had been sent on to Happysleep.\n\nThat was the grimmest form of population equalization. Walton initialed\nthe report, earmarked it for files, and dumped it in the pneumochute.\n\nThe annunciator chimed.\n\n\"I'm busy,\" Walton said immediately.\n\n\"There's a Mr. Prior to see you,\" the annunciator's calm voice said.\n\"He insists it's an emergency.\"\n\n\"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see anyone for at least three hours.\" Walton\nstared gloomily at the growing pile of paper on his desk. \"Tell him he\ncan have ten minutes with me at--oh, say, 1300.\"\n\nWalton heard an angry male voice muttering something in the outer\noffice, and then the annunciator said, \"He insists he must see you\nimmediately in reference to a Happysleep commitment.\"\n\n\"Commitments are irrevocable,\" Walton said heavily. The last thing in\nthe world he wanted was to see a man whose child or parent had just\nbeen committed. \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see him at all.\"\n\nWalton found his fingers trembling; he clamped them tight to the edge\nof his desk to steady himself. It was all right sitting up here in this\nugly building and initialing commitment papers, but actually to _see_\none of those people and try to convince him of the need--\n\nThe door burst open.\n\nA tall, dark-haired man in an open jacket came rushing through and\npaused dramatically just over the threshold. Immediately behind him\ncame three unsmiling men in the gray silk-sheen uniforms of security.\nThey carried drawn needlers.\n\n\"Are you Administrator Walton?\" the big man asked, in an astonishingly\ndeep, rich voice. \"I have to see you. I'm Lyle Prior.\"\n\nThe three security men caught up and swarmed all over Prior. One of\nthem turned apologetically to Walton. \"We're terribly sorry about this,\nsir. He just broke away and ran. We can't understand how he got in\nhere, but he did.\"\n\n\"Ah--yes. So I noticed,\" Walton remarked drily. \"See if he's planning\nto assassinate anybody, will you?\"\n\n\"Administrator Walton!\" Prior protested. \"I'm a man of peace! How can\nyou accuse me of--\"\n\nOne of the security men hit him. Walton stiffened and resisted the urge\nto reprimand the man. He was only doing his job, after all.\n\n\"Search him,\" Walton said.\n\nThey gave Prior an efficient going-over. \"He's clean, Mr. Walton.\nShould we take him to security, or downstairs to health?\"\n\n\"Neither. Leave him here with me.\"\n\n\"Are you sure you--\"\n\n\"Get out of here,\" Walton snapped. As the three security men slinked\naway, he added, \"And figure out some more efficient system for\nprotecting me. Some day an assassin is going to sneak through here\nand get me. Not that I give a damn about myself, you understand; it's\nsimply that I'm indispensable. There isn't another lunatic in the world\nwho'd take this job. Now _get out_!\"\n\nThey wasted no time in leaving. Walton waited until the door closed\nand jammed down hard on the lockstud. His tirade, he knew, was wholly\nunjustified; if he had remembered to lock his door as regulations\nprescribed, Prior would never have broken in. But he couldn't admit\nthat to the guards.\n\n\"Take a seat, Mr. Prior.\"\n\n\"I have to thank you for granting me this audience,\" Prior said,\nwithout a hint of sarcasm in his booming voice. \"I realize you're a\nterribly busy man.\"\n\n\"I am.\" Another three inches of paper had deposited itself on Walton's\ndesk since Prior had entered. \"You're very lucky to have hit the\npsychological moment for your entrance. At any other time I'd have\nhad you brigged for a month, but just now I'm in need of a little\ndiversion. Besides, I very much admire your work, Mr. Prior.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\" Again that humility, startling in so big and commanding a\nman. \"I hadn't expected to find--I mean that you--\"\n\n\"That a bureaucrat should admire poetry? Is that what you're groping\nfor?\"\n\nPrior reddened. \"Yes,\" he admitted.\n\nGrinning, Walton said, \"I have to do _something_ when I go home at\nnight. I don't really read Popeek reports twenty-four hours a day. No\nmore than twenty; that's my rule. I thought your last book was quite\nremarkable.\"\n\n\"The critics didn't,\" Prior said diffidently.\n\n\"Critics! What do they know?\" Walton demanded. \"They swing in cycles.\nTen years ago it was form and technique, and you got the Melling Prize.\nNow it's message, political content that counts. That's not poetry, Mr.\nPrior--and there are still a few of us who recognize what poetry is.\nTake Yeats, for instance--\"\n\nWalton was ready to launch into a discussion of every poet from Prior\nback to Surrey and Wyatt; anything to keep from the job at hand,\nanything to keep his mind from Popeek. But Prior interrupted him.\n\n\"Mr. Walton....\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"My son Philip ... he's two weeks old now....\"\n\nWalton understood. \"No, Prior. Please don't ask.\" Walton's skin felt\ncold; his hands, tightly clenched, were clammy.\n\n\"He was committed to Happysleep this morning--potentially tubercular.\nThe boy's perfectly sound, Mr. Walton. Couldn't you--\"\n\nWalton rose. \"_No_,\" he said, half-commanding, half-pleading. \"Don't\nask me to do it. I can't make any exceptions, not even for you. You're\nan intelligent man; you understand our program.\"\n\n\"I voted for Popeek. I know all about Weeding the Garden and the\nEuthanasia Plan. But I hadn't expected--\"\n\n\"You thought euthanasia was a fine thing for _other_ people. So did\neveryone else,\" Walton said. \"That's how the act was passed.\" Tenderly\nhe said, \"I can't do it. I can't spare your son. Our doctors give a\nbaby every chance to live.\"\n\n\"_I_ was tubercular. They cured me. What if they had practiced\neuthanasia a generation ago? Where would my poems be now?\"\n\nIt was an unanswerable question; Walton tried to ignore it.\n\"Tuberculosis is an extremely rare disease, Mr. Prior. We can wipe\nit out completely if we strike at those with TB-susceptible genetic\ntraits.\"\n\n\"Meaning you'll kill any children I have?\" Prior asked.\n\n\"Those who inherit your condition,\" Walton said gently. \"Go home, Mr.\nPrior. Burn me in effigy. Write a poem about me. But don't ask me to do\nthe impossible. I can't catch any falling stars for you.\"\n\nPrior rose. He was immense, a hulking tragic figure staring broodingly\nat Walton. For the first time since the poet's abrupt entry, Walton\nfeared violence. His fingers groped for the needle gun he kept in his\nupper left desk drawer.\n\nBut Prior had no violence in him. \"I'll leave you,\" he said somberly.\n\"I'm sorry, sir. Deeply sorry. For both of us.\"\n\nWalton pressed the doorlock to let him out, then locked it again and\nslipped heavily into his chair. Three more reports slid out of the\nchute and landed on his desk. He stared at them as if they were three\nbasilisks.\n\nIn the six weeks of Popeek's existence, three thousand babies had been\nticketed for Happysleep, and three thousand sets of degenerate genes\nhad been wiped from the race. Ten thousand subnormal males had been\nsterilized. Eight thousand dying oldsters had reached their graves\nahead of time.\n\nIt was a tough-minded program. But why transmit palsy to unborn\ngenerations? Why let an adult idiot litter the world with subnormal\nprogeny? Why force a man hopelessly cancerous to linger on in pain,\nconsuming precious food?\n\nUnpleasant? Sure. But the world had voted for it. Until Lang and his\nteam succeeded in terraforming Venus, or until the faster-than-light\noutfit opened the stars to mankind, something had to be done about\nEarth's overpopulation. There were seven billion now and the figure was\nstill growing.\n\nPrior's words haunted him. _I was tubercular ... where would my poems\nbe now?_\n\nThe big humble man was one of the great poets. Keats had been\ntubercular too.\n\n_What good are poets?_ he asked himself savagely.\n\nThe reply came swiftly: _What good is anything, then?_ Keats,\nShakespeare, Eliot, Yeats, Donne, Pound, Matthews ... and Prior. How\nmuch duller life would be without them, Walton thought, picturing\nhis bookshelf--his one bookshelf, in his crowded little cubicle of a\none-room home.\n\nSweat poured down his back as he groped toward his decision.\n\nThe step he was considering would disqualify him from his job if he\nadmitted it, though he wouldn't do that. Under the Equalization Law, it\nwould be a criminal act.\n\nBut just one baby wouldn't matter. Just one.\n\nPrior's baby.\n\nWith nervous fingers he switched on the annunciator and said, \"If there\nare any calls for me, take the message. I'll be out of my office for\nthe next half-hour.\"\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nHe stepped out of the office, glancing around furtively. The outer\noffice was busy: half a dozen girls were answering calls, opening\nletters, coordinating activities. Walton slipped quickly past them into\nthe hallway.\n\nThere was a knot of fear in his stomach as he turned toward the\nlift tube. Six weeks of pressure, six weeks of tension since Popeek\nwas organized and old man FitzMaugham had tapped him for the\nsecond-in-command post ... and now, a rebellion. The sparing of a\nsingle child was a small rebellion, true, but he knew he was striking\nas effectively at the base of Popeek this way as if he had brought\nabout repeal of the entire Equalization Law.\n\nWell, just one lapse, he promised himself. I'll spare Prior's child,\nand after that I'll keep within the law.\n\nHe jabbed the lift tube indicator and the tube rose in its shaft. The\nclinic was on the twentieth floor.\n\n\"Roy.\"\n\nAt the sound of the quiet voice behind him, Walton jumped in surprise.\nHe steadied himself, forcing himself to turn slowly. The director stood\nthere.\n\n\"Good morning, Mr. FitzMaugham.\"\n\nThe old man was smiling serenely, his unlined face warm and friendly,\nhis mop of white hair bright and full. \"You look preoccupied, boy.\nSomething the matter?\"\n\nWalton shook his head quickly. \"Just a little tired, sir. There's been\na lot of work lately.\"\n\nAs he said it, he knew how foolish it sounded. If anyone in Popeek\nworked harder than he did, it was the elderly director. FitzMaugham\nhad striven for equalization legislature for fifty years, and now, at\nthe age of eighty, he put in a sixteen-hour day at the task of saving\nmankind from itself.\n\nThe director smiled. \"You never did learn how to budget your strength,\nRoy. You'll be a worn-out wreck before you're half my age. I'm glad\nyou're adopting my habit of taking a coffee break in the morning,\nthough. Mind if I join you?\"\n\n\"I'm--not taking a break, sir. I have some work to do downstairs.\"\n\n\"Oh? Can't you take care of it by phone?\"\n\n\"No, Mr. FitzMaugham.\" Walton felt as though he'd already been tried,\ndrawn, and quartered. \"It requires personal attention.\"\n\n\"I see.\" The deep, warm eyes bored into his. \"You ought to slow down a\nlittle, I think.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. As soon as the work eases up a little.\"\n\nFitzMaugham chuckled. \"In another century or two, you mean. I'm afraid\nyou'll never learn how to relax, my boy.\"\n\nThe lift tube arrived. Walton stepped to one side, allowed the Director\nto enter, and got in himself. FitzMaugham pushed _Fourteen_; there was\na coffee shop down there. Hesitantly, Walton pushed _twenty_, covering\nthe panel with his arm so the old man would be unable to see his\ndestination.\n\nAs the tube began to descend, FitzMaugham said, \"Did Mr. Prior come to\nsee you this morning?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Walton said.\n\n\"He's the poet, isn't he? The one you say is so good?\"\n\n\"That's right, sir,\" Walton said tightly.\n\n\"He came to see me first, but I had him referred down to you. What was\non his mind?\"\n\nWalton hesitated. \"He--he wanted his son spared from Happysleep.\nNaturally, I had to turn him down.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" FitzMaugham agreed solemnly. \"Once we make even one\nexception, the whole framework crumbles.\"\n\n\"Of course, sir.\"\n\nThe lift tube halted and rocked on its suspension. The door slid back,\nrevealing a neat, gleaming sign:\n\n                              _FLOOR 20_\n                     _Euthanasia Clinic and Files_\n\nWalton had forgotten the accursed sign. He began to wish he had avoided\ntraveling down with the director. He felt that his purpose must seem\nnakedly obvious now.\n\nThe old man's eyes were twinkling amusedly. \"I guess you get off here,\"\nhe said. \"I hope you catch up with your work soon, Roy. You really\nshould take some time off for relaxation each day.\"\n\n\"I'll try, sir.\"\n\nWalton stepped out of the tube and returned FitzMaugham's smile as the\ndoor closed again. Bitter thoughts assailed him as soon as he was alone.\n\n_Some fine criminal you are. You've given the show away already! And\ndamn that smooth paternal smile. FitzMaugham knows! He must know!_\n\nWalton wavered, then abruptly made his decision. He sucked in a deep\nbreath and walked briskly toward the big room where the euthanasia\nfiles were kept.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe room was large, as rooms went nowadays--thirty by twenty, with deck\nupon deck of Donnerson micro-memory-tubes racked along one wall and a\nbank of microfilm records along the other. In six weeks of life Popeek\nhad piled up an impressive collection of data.\n\nWhile he stood there, the computer chattered, lights flashed. New facts\npoured into the memory banks. It probably went on day and night.\n\n\"Can I help--oh, it's you, Mr. Walton,\" a white-smocked technician\nsaid. Popeek employed a small army of technicians, each one faceless\nand without personality, but always ready to serve. \"Is there anything\nI can do?\"\n\n\"I'm simply running a routine checkup. Mind if I use the machine?\"\n\n\"Not at all, sir. Go right ahead.\"\n\nWalton grinned lightly and stepped forward. The technician practically\nbacked out of his presence.\n\n_No doubt I must radiate charisma_, he thought. Within the building he\nwore a sort of luminous halo, by virtue of being Director FitzMaugham's\nprot\u00e9g\u00e9 and second-in-command. Outside, in the colder reality of the\ncrowded metropolis, he kept his identity and Popeek rank quietly to\nhimself.\n\nFrowning, he tried to remember the Prior boy's name. Ah ... Philip,\nwasn't it? He punched out a request for the card on Philip Prior.\n\nA moment's pause followed, while the millions of tiny cryotronic\ncircuits raced with information pulses, searching the Donnerson\ntubes for Philip Prior's record. Then, a brief squeaking sound and a\nyellow-brown card dropped out of the slot:\n\n    _3216847AB1_\n\n    _PRIOR, Philip Hugh. Born 31 May 2232, New York General Hospital,\n    New York. First son of Prior, Lyle Martin and Prior, Ava Leonard.\n    Wgt. at birth 5lb. 3oz._\n\nAn elaborate description of the boy in great detail followed, ending\nwith blood type, agglutinating characteristic, and gene-pattern,\ncodified. Walton skipped impatiently through that and came to the\nnotification typed in curt, impersonal green capital letters at the\nbottom of the card:\n\n              _EXAMINED AT N Y EUTH CLINIC 10 JUNE 2332_\n\n                       _EUTHANASIA RECOMMENDED_\n\nHe glanced at his watch: the time was 1026. The boy was probably still\nsomewhere in the clinic lab, waiting for the figurative axe to descend.\n\nWalton had set up the schedule himself: the gas chamber delivered\nHappysleep each day at 1100 and 1500. He had about half an hour to save\nPhilip Prior.\n\nHe peered covertly over his shoulder; no one was in sight. He slipped\nthe baby's card into his breast pocket.\n\nThat done, he typed out a requisition for explanation of the\ngene-sorting code the clinic used. Symbols began pouring forth,\nand Walton puzzledly correlated them with the line of gibberish on\nPhillip Prior's record card. Finally he found the one he wanted: _3f2,\ntubercular-prone_.\n\nHe scrapped the guide sheet he had and typed out a message to the\nmachine. _Revision of card number 3216847AB1 follows. Please alter in\nall circuits._\n\nHe proceeded to retype the child's card, omitting both the fatal symbol\n_3f2_ and the notation recommending euthanasia from the new version.\nThe machine beeped an acknowledgement. Walton smiled. So far, so good.\n\nThen, he requested the boy's file all over again. After the customary\npause, a card numbered 3216847AB1 dropped out of the slot. He read it.\n\nThe deletions had been made. As far as the machine was concerned,\nPhilip Prior was a normal, healthy baby.\n\nHe glanced at his watch. 1037. Still twenty-three minutes before this\nmorning's haul of unfortunates was put away.\n\nNow came the real test: could he pry the baby away from the doctors\nwithout attracting too much attention to himself in the process?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFive doctors were bustling back and forth as Walton entered the main\nsection of the clinic. There must have been a hundred babies there,\neach in a little pen of its own, and the doctors were humming from one\nto the next, while anxious parents watched from screens above.\n\nThe Equalization Law provided that every child be presented at its\nlocal clinic within two weeks of birth, for an examination and a\ncertificate. Perhaps one in ten thousand would be denied a\ncertificate ... and life.\n\n\"Hello, Mr. Walton. What brings you down here?\"\n\nWalton smiled affably. \"Just a routine investigation, Doctor. I try to\nkeep in touch with every department we have, you know.\"\n\n\"Mr. FitzMaugham was down here to look around a little while ago. We're\nreally getting a going-over today, Mr. Walton!\"\n\n\"Umm. Yes.\" Walton didn't like that, but there was nothing he could\ndo about it. He'd have to rely on the old man's abiding faith in his\nprot\u00e9g\u00e9 to pull him out of any possible stickiness that arose.\n\n\"Seen my brother around?\" he asked.\n\n\"Fred? He's working in room seven, running analyses. Want me to get him\nfor you, Mr. Walton?\"\n\n\"No--no, don't bother him, thanks. I'll find him later.\" Inwardly,\nWalton felt relieved. Fred Walton, his younger brother, was a doctor in\nthe employ of Popeek. Little love was lost between the brothers, and\nRoy did not care to have Fred know he was down there.\n\nStrolling casually through the clinic, he peered at a few plump,\nsqualling babies, and said, \"Find many sour ones today?\"\n\n\"Seven so far. They're scheduled for the 1100 chamber. Three tuberc,\ntwo blind, one congenital syph.\"\n\n\"That only makes six,\" Walton said.\n\n\"Oh, and a spastic,\" the doctor said. \"Biggest haul we've had yet.\nSeven in one morning.\"\n\n\"Have any trouble with the parents?\"\n\n\"What do you think?\" the doctor asked. \"But some of them seemed to\nunderstand. One of the tuberculars nearly raised the roof, though.\"\n\nWalton shuddered. \"You remember his name?\" he asked, with feigned calm.\n\nSilence for a moment. \"No. Darned if I can think of it. I can look it\nup for you if you like.\"\n\n\"Don't bother,\" Walton said hurriedly.\n\nHe moved on, down the winding corridor that led to the execution\nchamber. Falbrough, the executioner, was studying a list of names at\nhis desk when Walton appeared.\n\nFalbrough didn't look like the sort of man who would enjoy his work. He\nwas short and plump, with a high-domed bald head and glittering contact\nlenses in his weak blue eyes. \"Morning, Mr. Walton.\"\n\n\"Good morning, Doctor Falbrough. You'll be operating soon, won't you?\"\n\n\"Eleven hundred, as usual.\"\n\n\"Good. There's a new regulation in effect from now on,\" Walton said.\n\"To keep public opinion on our side.\"\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"Henceforth, until further notice, you're to check each baby that\ncomes to you against the main file, just to make sure there's been no\nmistake. Got that?\"\n\n\"_Mistake?_ But how--\"\n\n\"Never mind that, Falbrough. There was quite a tragic slip-up at one\nof the European centers yesterday. We may all hang for it if news gets\nout.\" _How glibly I reel this stuff off_, Walton thought in amazement.\n\nFalbrough looked grave. \"I see, sir. Of course. We'll double-check\neverything from now on.\"\n\n\"Good. Begin with the 1100 batch.\"\n\nWalton couldn't bear to remain down in the clinic any longer. He left\nvia a side exit, and signaled for a lift tube.\n\nMinutes later he was back in his office, behind the security of a\ntowering stack of work. His pulse was racing; his throat was dry. He\nremembered what FitzMaugham had said: _Once we make even one exception,\nthe whole framework crumbles._\n\nWell, the framework had begun crumbling, then. And there was little\ndoubt in Walton's mind that FitzMaugham knew or would soon know what he\nhad done. He would have to cover his traces, somehow.\n\nThe annunciator chimed and said, \"Dr. Falbrough of Happysleep calling\nyou, sir.\"\n\n\"Put him on.\"\n\nThe screen lit and Falbrough's face appeared; its normal blandness had\ngiven way to wild-eyed tenseness.\n\n\"What is it, Doctor?\"\n\n\"It's a good thing you issued that order when you did, sir! You'll\nnever guess what just happened--\"\n\n\"No guessing games, Falbrough. Speak up.\"\n\n\"I--well, sir, I ran checks on the seven babies they sent me this\nmorning. And guess--I mean--well, one of them shouldn't have been sent\nto me!\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"It's the truth, sir. A cute little baby indeed. I've got his card\nright here. The boy's name is Philip Prior, and his gene-pattern is\nfine.\"\n\n\"Any recommendation for euthanasia on the card?\" Walton asked.\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\nWalton chewed at a ragged cuticle for a moment, counterfeiting great\nanxiety. \"Falbrough, we're going to have to keep this very quiet.\nSomeone slipped up in the examining room, and if word gets out that\nthere's been as much as one mistake, we'll have a mob swarming over us\nin half an hour.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" Falbrough looked terribly grave. \"What should I do, sir?\"\n\n\"Don't say a word about this to _anyone_, not even the men in the\nexamining room. Fill out a certificate for the boy, find his parents,\napologize and return him to them. And make sure you keep checking for\nany future cases of this sort.\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir. Is that all?\"\n\n\"It is,\" Walton said crisply, and broke the contact. He took a deep\nbreath and stared bleakly at the far wall.\n\nThe Prior boy was safe. And in the eyes of the law--the Equalization\nLaw--Roy Walton was now a criminal. He was every bit as much a criminal\nas the man who tried to hide his dying father from the investigators,\nor the anxious parents who attempted to bribe an examining doctor.\n\nHe felt curiously dirty. And, now that he had betrayed FitzMaugham and\nthe Cause, now that it was done, he had little idea why he had done\nit, why he had jeopardized the Popeek program, his position--his life,\neven--for the sake of one potentially tubercular baby.\n\nWell, the thing was done.\n\nNo. Not quite. Later, when things had quieted down, he would have to\nfinish the job by transferring all the men in the clinic to distant\nplaces and by obliterating the computer's memories of this morning's\nactivities.\n\nThe annunciator chimed again. \"Your brother is on the wire, sir.\"\n\nWalton trembled imperceptibly as he said, \"Put him on.\" Somehow, Fred\nnever called unless he could say or do something unpleasant. And\nWalton was very much afraid that his brother meant no good by this\ncall. No good at all.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nRoy Walton watched his brother's head and shoulders take form out of\nthe swirl of colors on the screen. Fred Walton was more compact, built\ncloser to the ground than his rangy brother; he was a squat five-seven,\nnext to Roy's lean six-two. Fred had always threatened to \"get even\"\nwith his older brother as soon as they were the same size, but to\nFred's great dismay he had never managed to catch up with Roy in height.\n\nEven on the screen, Fred's neck and shoulders gave an impression of\ntremendous solidity and force. Walton waited for his brother's image to\ntake shape, and when the time lag was over he said, \"Well, Fred? What\ngoes?\"\n\nHis brother's eyes flickered sleepily. \"They tell me you were down here\na little while ago, Roy. How come I didn't rate a visit?\"\n\n\"I wasn't in your section. It was official business, anyway. I didn't\nhave time.\"\n\nWalton fixed his eyes sharply on the caduceus emblem gleaming on Fred's\nlapel, and refused to look anywhere else.\n\nFred said slowly, \"You had time to tinker with our computer, though.\"\n\n\"Official business!\"\n\n\"Really, Roy?\" His brother's tone was venomous. \"I happened to\nbe using the computer shortly after you this morning. I was\ncurious--unpardonably so, dear brother. I requested a transcript of\nyour conversation with the machine.\"\n\nSparks seemed to flow from the screen. Walton sat back, feeling numb.\nHe managed to pull his sagging mouth back into a stiff hard line and\nsay, \"That's a criminal offense, Fred. Any use I make of a Popeek\ncomputer outlet is confidential.\"\n\n\"Criminal offence? Maybe so ... but that makes two of us, then. Eh,\nRoy?\"\n\n\"How much do you know?\"\n\n\"You wouldn't want me to recite it over a public communications system,\nwould you? Your friend FitzMaugham might be listening to every word of\nthis, and I have too much fraternal feeling for that. Ole Doc Walton\ndoesn't want to get his bigwig big brother in trouble--oh, no!\"\n\n\"Thanks for small blessings,\" Roy said acidly.\n\n\"You got me this job. You can take it away. Let's call it even for now,\nshall we?\"\n\n\"Anything you like,\" Walton said. He was drenched in sweat, though\nthe ingenious executive filter in the sending apparatus of the screen\ncloaked that fact and presented him as neat and fresh. \"I have some\nwork to do now.\" His voice was barely audible.\n\n\"I won't keep you any longer, then,\" Fred said.\n\nThe screen went dead.\n\nWalton killed the contact at his end, got up, walked to the window. He\nnudged the opaquer control and the frosty white haze over the glass\ncleared away, revealing the fantastic beehive of the city outside.\n\n_Idiot!_ he thought. _Fool!_\n\nHe had risked everything to save one baby, one child probably doomed\nto an early death anyway. And FitzMaugham knew--the old man could see\nthrough Walton with ease--and Fred knew, too. His brother, and his\nfather-substitute.\n\nFitzMaugham might well choose to conceal Roy's defection this time,\nbut would surely place less trust in him in the future. And as for\nFred....\n\nThere was no telling what Fred might do. They had never been\nparticularly close as brothers; they had lived with their parents (now\nalmost totally forgotten) until Roy was nine and Fred seven. Their\nparents had gone down off Maracaibo in a jet crash; Roy and Fred had\nbeen sent to the public cr\u00e8che.\n\nAfter that it had been separate paths for the brothers. For Roy, an\neducation in the law, a short spell as Senator FitzMaugham's private\nsecretary, followed last month by his sudden elevation to assistant\nadministrator of the newly-created Popeek Bureau. For Fred, medicine,\nunsuccessful private practice, finally a job in the Happysleep section\nof Popeek, thanks to Roy.\n\n_And now he has the upper hand for the first time_, Walton thought. _I\nhope he's not thirsting for my scalp._\n\nHe was being ground in a vise; he saw now the gulf between the\ntoughness needed for a Popeek man and the very real streak of softness\nthat was part of his character. Walton suddenly realized that he had\nnever merited his office. His only honorable move would be to offer his\nresignation to FitzMaugham at once.\n\nHe thought back, thought of the Senator saying, _This is a job for a\nman with no heart. Popeek is the cruelest organization ever legislated\nby man. You think you can handle it, Roy?_\n\n_I think so, sir. I hope so._\n\nHe remembered going on to declare some fuzzy phrases about the need\nfor equalization, the immediate necessity for dealing with Earth's\npopulation problem.\n\n_Temporary cruelty is the price of eternal happiness_, FitzMaugham had\nsaid.\n\nWalton remembered the day when the United Nations had finally\nagreed, had turned the Population Equalization Bureau loose on a\nstunned world. There had been the sharp flare of flash guns, the\nclatter of reporters feeding the story to the world, the momentary\nhigh-mindedness, the sense of the nobility of Popeek....\n\nAnd then the six weeks of gathering hatred. No one liked Popeek. No one\nliked to put antiseptic on wounds, either, but it had to be done.\n\nWalton shook his head sorrowfully. He had made a serious mistake by\nsaving Philip Prior. But resigning his post was no way to atone for it.\n\nHe opaqued the window again and returned to his desk. It was time to go\nthrough the mail.\n\nThe first letter on the stack was addressed to him by hand; he slit it\nopen and scanned it.\n\n    _Dear Mr Walton_,\n\n    _Yesterday your men came and took away my mother to be kild. She\n    didn't do nothing and lived a good life for seventy years and I want\n    you to know I think you people are the biggest vermin since Hitler\n    and Stalin and when youre old and sick I hope your own men come for\n    you and stick you in the furnace where you belong. You stink and\n    all of you stink._\n\n    Signed, _Disgusted_\n\nWalton shrugged and opened the next letter, typed in a crisp voicewrite\nscript on crinkly watermarked paper.\n\n    _Sir_:\n\n    _I see by the papers that the latest euthanasia figures are the\n    highest yet, and that you have successfully rid the world of many\n    of its weak sisters, those who are unable to stand the gaff, those\n    who, in the words of the immortal Darwin \"are not fit to survive.\"\n    My heartiest congratulations, sir, upon the scope and ambition of\n    your bold and courageous program. Your Bureau offers mankind its\n    first real chance to enter that promised land, that Utopia, that\n    has been our hope and prayer for so long._\n\n    _I do sincerely hope, though, that your Bureau is devoting careful\n    thought to the type of citizen that should be spared. It seems\n    obvious that the myriad spawning Asiatics should be reduced\n    tremendously, since their unchecked proliferation has caused such\n    great hardship to humanity. The same might be said of the Europeans\n    who refuse to obey the demands of sanity; and, coming closer to\n    home, I pray you reduce the numbers of Jews, Catholics, Communists,\n    anti-Herschelites, and other freethinking rabble, in order to make\n    the new reborn world purer and cleaner and ..._\n\nWith a sickly cough Walton put the letter down. Most of them were just\nthis sort: intelligent, rational, bigoted letters. There had been the\neducated Alabamian, disturbed that Popeek did not plan to eliminate all\nforms of second-class citizens; there had been the Michigan minister,\nanxious that no left-wing relativistic atheists escape the gas chamber.\n\nAnd, of course, there were the other kind--the barely literate letters\nfrom bereaved parents or relatives, accusing Popeek of nameless crimes\nagainst humanity.\n\nWell, it was only to be expected, Walton thought. He scribbled his\ninitials on both the letters and dropped them into the chute that led\nto files, where they would be put on microfilm and scrupulously stored\naway. FitzMaugham insisted that every letter received be read and so\nfiled.\n\nSome day soon, Walton thought, population equalization would be\nunnecessary. Oh, sure, euthanasia would stick; it was a sane and, in\nthe long run, merciful process. But this business of uprooting a few\nthousand Belgians and shipping them to the open spaces in Patagonia\nwould cease.\n\nLang and his experimenters were struggling to transform Venus into a\nlivable world. If it worked, the terraforming engineers could go on to\nconvert Mars, the bigger moons of Jupiter and Saturn, and perhaps even\ndistant Pluto, if some form of heating could be developed.\n\nThere would be another transition then. Earth's multitudes would be\nshipped wholesale to the new worlds. Perhaps there would be riots; none\nbut a few adventurers would go willingly. But some would go, and that\nwould be a partial solution.\n\nAnd then, the stars. The faster-than-light project was top secret, so\ntop secret that in Popeek only FitzMaugham knew what was being done on\nit. But if it came through....\n\nWalton shrugged and turned back to his work. Reports had to be read,\nfiled, expedited.\n\nThe thought of Fred and what Fred knew bothered him. If only there\nwere some way to relive this morning, to let the Prior baby go to the\nchamber as it deserved....\n\nTension pounded in him. He slipped a hand into his desk, fumbled, found\nthe green, diamond-shaped pellet he was searching for, and swallowed\nthe benzolurethrin almost unthinkingly. The tranquilizer was only\npartly successful in relaxing him, but he was able to work steadily,\nwithout a break, until noon.\n\nHe was about to dial for lunch when the private screen he and\nFitzMaugham used between their offices glowed into life.\n\n\"Roy?\"\n\nThe director's face looked impossibly tranquil.\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"I'm going to have a visitor at 1300. Ludwig. He wants to know how\nthings are going.\"\n\nWalton nodded. Ludwig was the head American delegate to the United\nNations, a stubborn, dedicated man who had fought Popeek for years;\nthen he had seen the light and had fought just as strenuously for its\nadoption. \"Do you want me to prepare a report for him?\" Walton asked.\n\n\"No, Roy. I want you to be here. I don't want to face him alone.\"\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"Some of the UN people feel I'm running Popeek as a one-man show,\"\nFitzMaugham explained. \"Of course, that's not so, as that mountain of\nwork on your desk testifies. But I want you there as evidence of the\ntruth. I want him to see how much I have to rely on my assistants.\"\n\n\"I get it. Very good, Mr. FitzMaugham.\"\n\n\"And another thing,\" the Director went on. \"It'll help appearances if\nI show myself surrounded with loyal young lieutenants of impeccable\ncharacter. Like you, Roy.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" Walton said weakly.\n\n\"Thank _you_. See you at 1300 sharp, then?\"\n\n\"Of course, sir.\"\n\nThe screen went dead. Walton stared at it blankly. He wondered if this\nwere some elaborate charade of the old man's; FitzMaugham was devious\nenough. That last remark, about loyal young lieutenants of impeccable\ncharacter ... it had seemed to be in good faith, but was it? Was\nFitzMaugham staging an intricate pretense before deposing his faithless\nprot\u00e9g\u00e9?\n\nMaybe Fred had something to do with it, Walton thought. He decided\nto have another session with the computer after his conference with\nFitzMaugham and Ludwig. Perhaps it still wasn't too late to erase the\ndamning data and cover his mistake.\n\nThen it would be just his word against Fred's. He might yet be able to\nbrazen through, he thought dully.\n\nHe ordered lunch with quivering fingers, and munched drearily on the\ntasteless synthetics for awhile before dumping them down the disposal\nchute.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nAt precisely 1255 Walton tidied his desk, rose and for the second time\nthat day, left his office. He was apprehensive, but not unduly so;\nbehind his immediate surface fears and tensions lay a calm certainty\nthat FitzMaugham ultimately would stick by him.\n\nAnd there was little to fear from Fred, he realized now. It was next to\nimpossible for a mere lower-level medic to gain the ear of the director\nhimself; in the normal course of events, if Fred attempted to contact\nFitzMaugham, he would automatically be referred to Roy.\n\nNo; the danger in Fred's knowledge was potential, not actual, and there\nmight still be time to come to terms with him. It was almost with a\njaunty step that Walton left his office, made his way through the busy\nouter office, and emerged in the outside corridor.\n\nFred was waiting there.\n\nHe was wearing his white medic's smock, stained yellow and red by\nreagents and coagulants. He was lounging against the curving plastine\ncorridor wall, hands jammed deep into his pockets. His thick-featured,\nbroad face wore an expression of elaborate casualness.\n\n\"Hello, Roy. Fancy finding _you_ here!\"\n\n\"How did you know I'd be coming this way?\"\n\n\"I called your office. They told me you were on your way to the lift\ntubes. Why so jumpy, brother? Have a tough morning?\"\n\n\"I've had worse,\" Walton said. He was tense, guarded. He pushed the\nstud beckoning the lift tube.\n\n\"Where you off to?\" Fred asked.\n\n\"Confidential. Top-level powwow with Fitz, if you have to know.\"\n\nFred's eyes narrowed. \"Strictly upper-echelon, aren't you? Do you have\na minute to talk to a mere mortal?\"\n\n\"Fred, don't make unnecessary trouble. You know--\"\n\n\"_Can it._ I've only got a minute or two left of my lunch hour. I want\nto make myself perfectly plain with you. Are there any spy pickups in\nthis corridor?\"\n\nWalton considered that. There were none that he knew of, and he knew of\nmost. Still, FitzMaugham might have found it advisable to plant a few\nwithout advertising the fact. \"I'm not sure,\" he said. \"What's on your\nmind?\"\n\nFred took a pad from his pocket and began to scrawl a note. Aloud he\nsaid, \"I'll take my chances and tell you about it anyway. One of the\nmen in the lab said another man told him you and FitzMaugham are both\nsecretly Herschelites.\" His brow furrowed with the effort of saying one\nthing and writing another simultaneously. \"Naturally, I won't give you\nany names yet, but I want you to know I'm investigating his background\nvery carefully. He may just have been shooting his mouth off.\"\n\n\"Is that why you didn't want this to go into a spy pickup?\" Walton\nasked.\n\n\"Exactly. I prefer to investigate unofficially for the time being.\"\nFred finished the note, ripped the sheet from the pad and handed it to\nhis brother.\n\nWalton read it wordlessly. The handwriting was jagged and untidy, for\nit was no easy feat to carry on a conversation for the benefit of any\nconcealed pickups while writing a message.\n\nIt said, _I know all about the Prior baby. I'll keep my mouth shut\nfor now, so don't worry. But don't try anything foolish, because I've\ndeposited an account of the whole thing where you can't find it._\n\nWalton crumpled the note and tucked it into his pocket. He said,\n\"Thanks for the information, Fred. I'll keep it in mind.\"\n\n\"Okay, pal.\"\n\nThe lift tube arrived. Walton stepped inside and pressed _twenty-nine_.\n\nIn the moment it took for the tube to rise the one floor, he thought,\n_So Fred's playing a waiting game.... He'll hold the information over\nmy head until he can make good use of it._\n\nThat was some relief, anyway. No matter what evidence Fred had already\nsalted away, Walton still had a chance to blot out some of the\ncomputer's memory track and obscure the trail to that extent.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe lift tube opened; a gleaming sign listed the various activities of\nthe twenty-ninth floor, and at the bottom of the list it said _D. F.\nFitzMaugham, Director_.\n\nFitzMaugham's office was at the back of a maze of small cubicles\nhousing Popeek functionaries of one sort or another. Walton had\nmade some attempt to familiarize himself with the organizational\nstratification of Popeek, but his success thus far had been minimal.\nFitzMaugham had conceived the plan half a century ago, and had lovingly\ncreated and worked over the organization's structure through all the\nlong years it took before the law was finally passed.\n\nThere were plenty of bugs in the system, but in general FitzMaugham's\nblueprint had been sound--sound enough for Popeek to begin functioning\nalmost immediately after its UN approval. The manifold departments, the\ntight network of inter-reporting agencies, the fantastically detailed\nbudget with its niggling appropriations for office supplies and its\nmassive expenditures for, say, the terraforming project--most of these\nwere fully understood only by FitzMaugham himself.\n\nWalton glanced at his watch. He was three minutes late; the\nconversation with his brother had delayed him. But Ludwig of the UN\nwas not known to be a scrupulously punctual man, and there was a high\nprobability he hadn't arrived.\n\nThe secretary in the office guarding FitzMaugham's looked up as Walton\napproached. \"The director is in urgent conference, sir, and--oh, I'm\nsorry, Mr. Walton. Go right in; Mr. FitzMaugham is expecting you.\"\n\n\"Is Mr. Ludwig here yet?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. He arrived about ten minutes ago.\"\n\nCurious, Walton thought. From what he knew of Ludwig he wasn't the man\nto arrive early for an appointment. Walton and FitzMaugham had had\nplenty of dealings with him in the days before Popeek was approved, and\nnever once had Ludwig been on time.\n\nWalton shrugged. If Ludwig could switch his stand so decisively from an\nemphatic anti-Popeek to an even more emphatic pro-Popeek, perhaps he\ncould change in other respects as well.\n\nWalton stepped within the field of the screener. His image, he knew,\nwas being relayed inside where FitzMaugham could scrutinize him\ncarefully before admitting him. The director was very touchy about\nadmitting people to his office.\n\nFive seconds passed; it usually took no more than that for FitzMaugham\nto admit him. But there was no sign from within, and Walton coughed\ndiscreetly.\n\nStill no answer. He turned away and walked over to the desk where the\nsecretary sat dictating into a voicewrite. He waited for her to finish\nher sentence, then touched her arm lightly.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Walton?\"\n\n\"The screen transmission seems to be out of order. Would you mind\ncalling Mr. FitzMaugham on the annunciator and telling him I'm here?\"\n\n\"Of course, sir.\"\n\nHer fingers deftly flipped the switches. He waited for her to announce\nhim, but she paused and looked back at Walton. \"He doesn't acknowledge,\nMr. Walton. He must be awfully busy.\"\n\n\"He _has_ to acknowledge. Ring him again.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, sir, but--\"\n\n\"_Ring him again._\"\n\nShe rang, reluctantly, without any response. FitzMaugham preferred the\nsort of annunciator that had to be acknowledged; Walton allowed the\ngirl to break in on his privacy without the formality of a return buzz.\n\n\"Still no answer, sir.\"\n\nWalton was growing impatient. \"Okay, devil take the acknowledgment.\nBreak in on him and tell him I'm waiting out here. My presence is\nimportant inside.\"\n\n\"Sir, Mr. FitzMaugham absolutely forbids anyone to use the annunciator\nwithout his acknowledgment,\" the girl protested.\n\nHe felt his neck going red. \"I'll take the responsibility.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, sir--\"\n\n\"All right. Get away from that machine and let _me_ talk to him. If\nthere are repercussions, tell him I forced you at gunpoint.\"\n\nShe backed away, horrified, and he slid in behind the desk. He made\ncontact; there was no acknowledgment. He said, \"Mr. FitzMaugham, this\nis Roy. I'm outside your office now. Should I come in, or not?\"\n\nSilence. He stared thoughtfully at the apparatus.\n\n\"I'm going in there,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe door was of solid-paneled imitation wood, a couple of inches thick\nand probably filled with a good sturdy sheet of beryllium steel.\nFitzMaugham liked protection.\n\nWalton contemplated the door for a moment. Stepping into the screener\nfield, he said, \"Mr. FitzMaugham? Can you hear me?\" In the ensuing\nsilence he went on, \"This is Walton. I'm outside with a blaster, and\nunless I get any orders to the contrary, I'm going to break into your\noffice.\"\n\nSilence. This was very extraordinary indeed. He wondered if it were\npart of some trap of FitzMaugham's. Well, he'd find out soon enough. He\nadjusted the blaster aperture to short-range wide-beam, and turned it\non. A soft even flow of heat bathed the door.\n\nQuite a crowd of curious onlookers had gathered by now, at a respectful\ndistance. Walton maintained the steady heat. The synthetic wood was\nsloughing away in dribbly blue masses as the radiation broke it down;\nthe sheet of metal in the heart of the door was gleaming bright red.\n\nThe lock became visible now. Walton concentrated the flame there, and\nthe door creaked and groaned.\n\nHe snapped the blaster off, pocketed it, and kicked the door soundly.\nIt swung open.\n\nHe had a momentary glimpse of a blood-soaked white head slumped over a\nbroad desk--and then someone hit him amidships.\n\nHe was a man about his own height, wearing a blue suit woven through\nwith glittering gold threads; Walton's mind caught the details with odd\nclarity. The man's face was distorted with fear and shock, but Walton\nrecognized it clearly enough. The ruddy cheeks, the broad nose and\nbushy eyebrows, belonged to Ludwig.\n\nThe UN man. The man who had just assassinated Director FitzMaugham.\n\nHe was battering his fists into Walton, struggling to get past him and\nthrough the wrecked door, to escape somewhere, anywhere. Walton grunted\nas a fist crashed into his stomach. He reeled backward, gagging and\ngasping, but managed to keep his hand on the other's coat. Desperately\nhe pulled Ludwig to him. In the suddenness of the encounter he had no\ntime to evaluate what had happened, no time to react to FitzMaugham's\nmurder.\n\nHis one thought was that Ludwig had to be subdued.\n\nHis fist cracked into the other's mouth; sharp pain shot up through his\nhand at the impact of knuckles against teeth. Ludwig sagged. Walton\nrealized that he was blocking the doorway; not only was he preventing\nLudwig from escaping, he was also making it impossible for anyone\noutside to come to his own aid.\n\nBlindly he clubbed his fist down on Ludwig's neck, spun him around,\ncrashed another blow into the man's midsection. Suddenly Ludwig pulled\naway from him and ran back behind the director's desk.\n\nWalton followed him ... and stopped short as he saw the UN man pause,\nquiver tremulously, and topple to the floor. He sprawled grotesquely on\nthe deep beige carpet, shook for a moment, then was still.\n\nWalton gasped for breath. His clothes were torn, he was sticky with\nsweat and blood, his heart was pounding from unaccustomed exertion.\n\n_Ludwig's killed the director_, he thought leadenly. _And now Ludwig's\ndead._\n\nHe leaned against the doorpost. He was conscious of figures moving past\nhim, going into the room, examining FitzMaugham and the figure on the\nfloor.\n\n\"Are you all right?\" a crisp, familiar voice asked.\n\n\"Pretty winded,\" Walton admitted.\n\n\"Have some water.\"\n\nWalton accepted the drink, gulped it, looked up at the man who had\nspoken. \"Ludwig! How in hell's name--\"\n\n\"A double,\" the UN man said. \"Come over here and look at him.\"\n\nLudwig led him to the pseudo-Ludwig on the floor. It was an incredible\nresemblance. Two or three of the office workers had rolled the body\nover; the jaws were clenched stiffly, the face frozen in an agonized\nmask.\n\n\"He took poison,\" Ludwig said. \"I don't imagine he expected to get out\nof here alive. But he did his work well. God, I wish I'd been on time\nfor once in my life!\"\n\nWalton glanced numbly from the dead Ludwig on the floor to the live\none standing opposite him. His shocked mind realized dimly what had\nhappened. The assassin, masked to look like Ludwig, had arrived at\n1300, and had been admitted to the director's office. He had killed the\nold man, and then had remained inside the office, either hoping to make\nan escape later in the day, or perhaps simply waiting for the poison to\ntake effect.\n\n\"It was bound to happen,\" Ludwig said. \"They've been gunning for the\nsenator for years. And now that Popeek was passed....\"\n\nWalton looked involuntarily at the desk, mirror bright and uncluttered\nas always. Director FitzMaugham was sprawled forward, hands\nhalf-clenched, arms spread. His impressive mane of white hair was\nstained with his own blood. He had been clubbed--the simplest, crudest\nsort of murder.\n\nEmotional reaction began. Walton wanted to break things, to cry, to let\noff steam somehow. But there were too many people present; the office,\nonce sacrosanct, had miraculously become full of Popeek workers,\npolicemen, secretaries, possibly some telefax reporters.\n\nWalton recovered a shred of his authority. \"All of you, _outside_!\" he\nsaid loudly. He recognized Sellors, the building's security chief, and\nadded, \"Except you, Sellors. You can stay here.\"\n\nThe crowd melted away magically. Now there were just five in the\noffice--Sellors, Ludwig, Walton, and the two corpses.\n\nLudwig said, \"Do you have any idea who might be behind this, Mr.\nWalton?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said wearily. \"There are thousands who'd have wanted\nto kill the director. Maybe it was a Herschelite plot. There'll be a\nfull investigation.\"\n\n\"Mind stepping out of the way, sir?\" Sellors asked. \"I'd like to take\nsome photos.\"\n\nWalton and Ludwig moved to one side as the security man went to work.\nIt was inevitable, Walton thought, that this would happen. FitzMaugham\nhad been the living symbol of Popeek.\n\nHe walked to the battered door, reflecting that he would have it\nrepaired at once. That thought led naturally to a new one, but before\nit was fully formed in his own mind, Ludwig voiced it.\n\n\"This is a terrible tragedy,\" the UN man said. \"But one mitigating\nfactor exists. I'm sure Mr. FitzMaugham's successor will be a fitting\none. I'm confident you'll be able to carry on FitzMaugham's great work\nquite capably, Mr. Walton.\"\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nThe new sign on the office door said:\n\n                             _ROY WALTON_\n                          _Interim Director_\n                  _Bureau of Population Equalization_\n\nHe had argued against putting it up there, on the grounds that his\nappointment was strictly temporary, pending a meeting of the General\nAssembly to choose a new head for Popeek. But Ludwig had maintained it\nmight be weeks or months before such a meeting could be held and that\nthere was no harm in identifying his office.\n\n\"Everything under control?\" the UN man asked.\n\nWalton eyed him unhappily. \"I guess so. Now all I have to do is start\nfiguring out how Mr. FitzMaugham's filing system worked, and I'll be\nall set.\"\n\n\"You mean you don't know?\"\n\n\"Mr. FitzMaugham took very few people into his confidence,\" Walton\nsaid. \"Popeek was his special brain-child. He had lived with it so long\nhe thought its workings were self-evident to everyone. There'll be a\nperiod of adjustment.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Ludwig said.\n\n\"This conference you were going to have with the director yesterday\nwhen he--ah, what was it about?\" Walton asked.\n\nThe UN man shrugged. \"It's irrelevant now, I suppose. I wanted to find\nout how Popeek's subsidiary research lines were coming along. But I\nguess you'll have to go through Mr. FitzMaugham's files before you know\nanything, eh?\" Ludwig stared at him sharply.\n\nSuddenly, Walton did not like the cheerful UN man.\n\n\"There'll be a certain period of adjustment,\" he repeated. \"I'll let\nyou know when I'm ready to answer questions about Popeek.\"\n\n\"Of course. I didn't mean to imply any criticism of you or of the late\ndirector or of Popeek, Mr. Walton.\"\n\n\"Naturally. I understand, Mr. Ludwig.\"\n\nLudwig took his leave at last, and Walton was alone in the late Mr.\nFitzMaugham's office for the first time since the assassination. He\nspread his hands on the highly polished desk and twisted his wrists\noutward in a tense gesture. His fingers made squeaking sounds as they\nrubbed the wood surface.\n\nIt had been an uneasy afternoon yesterday, after the nightmare of the\nassassination and the subsequent security inquisition. Walton, wrung\ndry, had gone home early, leaving Popeek headless for two hours. The\nnewsblares in the jetbus had been programmed with nothing but talk of\nthe killing.\n\n\"A brutal hand today struck down the revered D. F. FitzMaugham,\neighty-one, Director of Population Equalization. Security officials\nreport definite prospects of solution of the shocking crime, and....\"\n\nThe other riders in the bus had been vehemently outspoken.\n\n\"It's about time they let him have it,\" a fat woman in sleazy old\nclothes said. \"That baby killer!\"\n\n\"I knew they'd get him sooner or later,\" offered a thin, wispy-haired\nold man. \"They _had_ to.\"\n\n\"Rumor going around he was really a Herschelite....\"\n\n\"Some new kid is taking over Popeek, they say. They'll get him too,\nmark my words.\"\n\nWalton, huddling in his seat, pulled up his collar, and tried to shut\nhis ears. It didn't work.\n\n_They'll get him too, mark my words._\n\nHe hadn't forgotten that prophecy by the time he reached his cubicle in\nupper Manhattan. The harsh words had drifted through his restless sleep\nall night.\n\nNow, behind the safety of his office door, he thought of them again.\n\nHe couldn't hide. It hadn't worked for FitzMaugham, and it wouldn't for\nhim.\n\nHiding wasn't the answer. Walton smiled grimly. If martyrdom were\nin store for him, let martyrdom come. The work of Popeek had to go\nforward. He decided he would conduct as much of his official business\nas possible by screen; but when personal contact was necessary, he\nwould make no attempt to avoid it.\n\nHe glanced around FitzMaugham's office. The director had been a product\nof the last century, and he had seen nothing ugly in the furnishings\nof the Cullen Building. Unlike Walton, then, he had not had his office\nremodeled.\n\nThat would be one of the first tasks--to replace the clumsy battery of\ntungsten-filament incandescents with a wall of electroluminescents, to\nreplace the creaking sash windows with some decent opaquers, to get rid\nof the accursed gingerbread trimming that offended the eye in every\ndirection. The _thunkety-thunk_ air-conditioner would have to go too;\nhe'd have a molecusorter installed in a day or two.\n\nThe redecorating problems were the minor ones. It was the task of\nfilling FitzMaugham's giant shoes, even on an interim basis, that\nstaggered Walton.\n\nHe fumbled in the desk for a pad and stylus. This was going to call for\nan agenda. Hastily he wrote:\n\n    _1. Cancel F's appointments_\n    _2. Investigate setup in Files_\n        _a) Lang terraforming project_\n        _b) faster-than-light_\n        _c) budget--stretchable?_\n        _d) locate spy pickups in building_\n    _3. Meeting with section chiefs_\n    _4. Press conference with telefax services_\n    _5. See Ludwig ... straighten things out_\n    _6. Redecorate office_\n\nHe thought for a moment, then erased a few of his numbers and changed\n_Press conference_ to _6._ and _Redecorate office_ to _4._ He licked\nthe stylus and wrote in at the very top of the paper:\n\n    _0. Finish Prior affair._\n\nIn a way, FitzMaugham's assassination had taken Walton off the hook\non the Prior case. Whatever FitzMaugham suspected about Walton's\nactivities yesterday morning no longer need trouble him. If the\ndirector had jotted down a memorandum on the subject, Walton would be\nable to find and destroy it when he went through FitzMaugham's files\nlater. And if the dead man had merely kept the matter in his head,\nwell, then it was safely at rest in the crematorium.\n\nWalton groped in his jacket pocket and found the note his brother had\nslipped to him at lunchtime the day before. In the rush of events,\nWalton had not had a chance to destroy it.\n\nNow, he read it once more, ripped it in half, ripped it again, and\nfed one quarter of the note into the disposal chute. He would get rid\nof the rest at fifteen-minute intervals, and he would defy anyone\nmonitoring the disposal units to locate all four fragments.\n\nActually, he realized he was being overcautious. This was Director\nFitzMaugham's office and FitzMaugham's disposal chute. The director\nwouldn't have arranged to have his _own_ chute monitored, would he?\n\nOr would he? There was never any telling, with FitzMaugham. The old man\nhad been terribly devious in every maneuver he made.\n\nThe room had the dry, crisp smell of the detecting devices that had\nbeen used--the close-to-the-ground, ugly metering-robots that had\ncrawled all over the floor, sniffing up footprints and stray dandruff\nflakes for analysis, the chemical cleansers that had mopped the blood\nout of the rug. Walton cursed at the air-conditioner that was so\ninefficiently removing these smells from the air.\n\nThe annunciator chimed. Walton waited impatiently for a voice, then\nremembered that FitzMaugham had doggedly required an acknowledgment.\nHe opened the channel and said, \"This is Walton. In the future no\nacknowledgment will be necessary.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. There's a reporter from _Citizen_ here, and one from Globe\nTelefax.\"\n\n\"Tell them I'm not seeing anyone today. Here, I'll give them a\nstatement. Tell them the Gargantuan task of picking up the reins where\nthe late, great Director FitzMaugham dropped them is one that will\nrequire my full energy for the next several days. I'll be happy to hold\nmy first official press conference as soon as Popeek is once again\nmoving on an even keel. Got that?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Good. Make sure they print it. And--oh, listen. If anyone shows up\ntoday or tomorrow who had an appointment with Director FitzMaugham,\ntell him approximately the same thing. Not in those flowery words, of\ncourse, but give him the gist of it. I've got a lot of catching up to\ndo before I can see people.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Director Walton.\"\n\nHe grinned at the sound of those words, _Director Walton_. Turning away\nfrom the annunciator, he took out his agenda and checked off number\none, _Cancel FitzMaugham's appointments_.\n\nFrowning, he realized he had better add a seventh item to the list:\n_Appoint new assistant administrator_. Someone would have to handle his\nold job.\n\nBut now, top priority went to the item ticketed zero on the list:\n_Finish Prior affair_. He'd never be in a better position to erase the\nevidence of yesterday's illegality than he was right now.\n\n\"Connect me with euthanasia files, please.\"\n\nA moment later a dry voice said, \"Files.\"\n\n\"Files, this is Acting Director Walton. I'd like a complete transcript\nof your computer's activities for yesterday morning between 0900 and\n1200, with each separate activity itemized. How soon can I have it?\"\n\n\"Within minutes, Director Walton.\"\n\n\"Good. Send it sealed, by closed circuit. There's some top-level stuff\non that transcript. If the seal's not intact when it gets here, I'll\nshake up the whole department.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Anything else, sir?\"\n\n\"No, that'll be--on second thought, yes. Send up a list of all doctors\nwho were examining babies in the clinic yesterday morning.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe waited. While he waited, he went through the top layer of memoranda\nin FitzMaugham's desk.\n\nThere was a note on top which read, _Appointment with Lamarre, 11\nJune--1215. Must be firm with him, and must handle with great delicacy.\nPerhaps time to let Walton know._\n\nHmm, that was interesting, Walton thought. He had no idea who Lamarre\nmight be, but FitzMaugham had drawn a spidery little star in the\nupper-right-hand corner of the memo sheet, indicating crash priority.\n\nHe flipped on the annunciator. \"There's a Mr. Lamarre who had an\nappointment with Director FitzMaugham for 1215 today. If he calls, tell\nhim I can't see him today but will honor the appointment tomorrow at\nthe same time. If he shows up, tell him the same thing.\"\n\nHis watch said it was time to dispose of another fragment of Fred's\nmessage. He stuffed it into the disposal chute.\n\nA moment later the green light flashed over the arrival bin;\nFitzMaugham had not been subject, as Walton had been in his previous\noffice, to cascades of material arriving without warning.\n\nWalton drew a sealed packet from the bin. He examined the seal\nand found it untampered, which was good; it meant the packet had\ncome straight from the computer, and had not even been read by the\ntechnician in charge. With it was a typed list of five names--the\ndoctors who had been in the lab the day before.\n\nBreaking open the packet, Walton discovered seven closely-typed sheets\nwith a series of itemized actions on them. He ran through them quickly,\ndiscarding sheets one, two, and three, which dealt with routine\nactivities of the computer in the early hours of the previous day.\n\nItem seventy-three was his request for Philip Prior's record card. He\nchecked that one off.\n\nItem seventy-four was his requisition for the key to the clinic's\ngene-sorting code.\n\nItem seventy-five was his revision of Philip Prior's records, omitting\nall reference to his tubercular condition and to the euthanasia\nrecommendation. Item seventy-six was the acknowledgment of this\nrevision.\n\nItem seventy-seven was his request for the boy's record card--this\ntime, the amended one. The five items were dated and timed; the\nearliest was 1025, the latest 1037, all on June tenth.\n\nWalton bracketed the five items thoughtfully, and scanned the rest of\nthe page. Nothing of interest there, just more routine business. But\nitem ninety-two, timed at 1102, was an intriguing one:\n\n_92: Full transcript of morning's transactions issued at request of Dr.\nFrederic Walton, 932K104AZ._\n\nFred hadn't been bluffing, then; he actually had possession of all the\ndamning evidence. But when one dealt with a computer and with Donnerson\nmicro-memory-tubes, the past was an extremely fluid entity.\n\n\"I want a direct line to the computer on floor twenty,\" he said.\n\nAfter a brief lag a technician appeared on the screen. It was the same\none he had spoken to earlier.\n\n\"There's been an error in the records,\" Walton said. \"An error I\nwouldn't want to perpetuate. Will you set me up so I can feed a direct\norder into the machine?\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir. Go ahead, sir.\"\n\n\"This is top secret. Vanish.\"\n\nThe technician vanished. Walton said, \"Items seventy-three through\nseventy-seven on yesterday morning's record tape are to be deleted,\nand the information carried in those tubes is to be deleted as well.\nFurthermore, there is to be no record made of this transaction.\"\n\nThe voicewrite on floor twenty clattered briefly, and the order\nfunneled into the computer. Walton waited a moment, tensely. Then he\nsaid, \"All right, technician. Come back in where I can see you.\"\n\nThe technician appeared. Walton said, \"I'm running a check now. Have\nthe machine prepare another transcript of yesterday's activities\nbetween 0900 and 1200, and also one of today's doings for the last\nfifteen minutes.\"\n\n\"Right away, sir.\"\n\nWhile he waited for the new transcripts to arrive, Walton studied the\nlist of names on his desk. Five doctors--Gunther, Raymond, Archer, Hsi,\nRein. He didn't know which one of them had examined the Prior baby, nor\ndid he care to find out. All five would have to be transferred.\n\nMeticulously, he took up his stylus and pad again, and plotted a\ndestination for each:\n\n    _Gunther ... Zurich._\n    _Raymond ... Glasgow._\n    _Archer ... Tierra del Fuego._\n    _Hsi ... Leopoldville._\n    _Rein ... Bangkok._\n\nHe nodded. That was optimum dissemination; he would put through notice\nof the transfers later in the day, and by nightfall the men would be on\ntheir way to their new scenes of operation. Perhaps they would never\nunderstand why they had been uprooted and sent away from New York.\n\nThe new transcripts arrived. Impatiently Walton checked through them.\n\nIn the June tenth transcript, item seventy-one dealt with smallpox\nstatistics for North America 1822-68, and item seventy-two with the\ntally of antihistamine supply for requisitions for Clinic Three. There\nwas no sign of any of Walton's requests. They had vanished from the\nrecord as completely as if they had never been.\n\nWalton searched carefully through the June eleventh transcript for any\nmention of his deletion order. No, that hadn't been recorded either.\n\nHe smiled, his first honest smile since FitzMaugham's assassination.\nNow, with the computer records erased, the director dead, and the\ndoctors on their way elsewhere, only Fred stood in the way of Roy's\nchance of escaping punishment for the Prior business.\n\nHe decided he'd have to take his chances with Fred. Perhaps brotherly\nlove would seal his lips after all.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nThe late Director FitzMaugham's files were spread over four floors of\nthe building, but for Walton's purposes the only ones that mattered\nwere those to which access was gained through the director's office\nalone.\n\nA keyboard and screen were set into the wall to the left of the desk.\nWalton let his fingers rest lightly on the gleaming keys.\n\nThe main problem facing him, he thought, lay in not knowing where to\nbegin. Despite his careful agenda, despite the necessary marshaling\nof his thoughts, he was still confused by the enormity of his job.\nThe seven billion people of the world were in his hands. He could\ntransfer fifty thousand New Yorkers to the bleak northern provinces of\nunderpopulated Canada with the same quick ease that he had shifted five\nunsuspecting doctors half an hour before.\n\nAfter a few moments of uneasy thought he pecked out the short message,\n_Request complete data file on terraforming project_.\n\nOn the screen appeared the words, _Acknowledged and coded; prepare to\nreceive_.\n\nThe arrival bin thrummed with activity. Walton hastily scooped out\na double handful of typed sheets to make room for more. He grinned\nin anguish as the paper kept on coming. FitzMaugham's files on\nterraforming, no doubt, covered reams and reams.\n\nStaggering, he carted it all over to his desk and began to skim through\nit. The data began thirty years earlier, in 2202, with a photostat of\na letter from Dr. Herbert Lang to FitzMaugham, proposing a project\nwhereby the inner planets of the solar system could be made habitable\nby human beings.\n\nAppended to that was FitzMaugham's skeptical, slightly mocking reply;\nthe old man had kept everything, it seemed, even letters which showed\nhim in a bad light.\n\nAfter that came more letters from Lang, urging FitzMaugham to plead\nterraforming's case before the United States Senate, and FitzMaugham's\nincreasingly more enthusiastic answers. Finally, in 2212, a notation\nthat the Senate had voted a million-dollar appropriation to Lang--a\nminiscule amount, in terms of the overall need, but it was enough to\ncover preliminary research. Lang had been grateful.\n\nWalton skimmed through more-or-less familiar documents on the nature of\nthe terraforming project. He could study those in detail later, if time\npermitted. What he wanted now was information on the current status of\nthe project; FitzMaugham had been remarkably silent about it, though\nthe public impression had been created that a team of engineers headed\nby Lang was already at work on Venus.\n\nHe shoved whole handfuls of letters to one side, looking for those of\nrecent date.\n\nHere was one dated 1 Feb 2232, FitzMaugham to Lang: it informed the\nscientist that passage of the Equalization Act was imminent, and that\nLang stood to get a substantial appropriation from the UN in that\nevent. A jubilant reply from Lang was attached.\n\nFollowing that came another, 10 May 2232, FitzMaugham to Lang:\nofficial authorization of Lang as an executive member of Popeek, and\nappropriation of--Walton's eyes bugged--five billion dollars for\nterraforming research.\n\nNote from Lang to FitzMaugham, 14 May: the terraforming crew was\nleaving for Venus immediately.\n\nNote from FitzMaugham to Lang, 16 May: best wishes, and Lang was\ninstructed to contact FitzMaugham without fail at weekly intervals.\n\nSpacegram from Lang to FitzMaugham, 28 May: arrived at Venus safely,\npreparing operation as scheduled.\n\nThe file ended there. Walton rummaged through the huge heap, hoping to\ndiscover a later communiqu\u00e9; by FitzMaugham's own request, Lang should\nhave contacted Popeek about four days ago with his first report.\n\nPossibly it had gone astray in delivery, Walton thought. He spent\ntwenty minutes digging through the assorted material before remembering\nthat he could get a replacement within seconds from the filing computer.\n\nHe typed out a requisition for any and all correspondence between\nDirector FitzMaugham and Dr. Herbert Lang that was dated after 28 May\n2232.\n\nThe machine acknowledged, and a moment later replied, _This material is\nnot included in memory banks_.\n\nWalton frowned, gathered up most of his superfluous terraforming data,\nand deposited it in a file drawer. The status of the project, then,\nwas uncertain: the terraformers were on Venus and presumably at work,\nbut were yet to be heard from.\n\nThe next Popeek project to track down would be the faster-than-light\nspaceship drive. But after the mass of data Walton had just absorbed,\nhe found himself hesitant to wade through another collection so soon.\n\nHe realized that he was hungry for the sight of another human being. He\nhad spent the whole morning alone, speaking to anonymous underlings via\nscreen or annunciator, and requisitioning material from an even more\nimpersonal computer. He wanted noise, life, people around him.\n\nHe snapped on the annunciator. \"I'm calling an immediate meeting of the\nPopeek section chiefs,\" he said. \"In my office, in half an hour--at\n1230 sharp. Tell them to drop whatever they're doing and come.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJust before they started to arrive, Walton felt a sudden sick wave of\ntension sweep dizzyingly over him. He pulled open the top drawer of\nhis new desk and reached for his tranquilizer tablets. He suffered a\nmoment of shock and disorientation before he realized that this was\nFitzMaugham's desk, not his own, and that FitzMaugham forswore all\nforms of sedation.\n\nChuckling nervously, Walton drew out his wallet and extracted the extra\nbenzolurethrin he carried for just such emergencies. He popped the\nlozenge into his mouth only a moment before the spare figure of Lee\nPercy, first of the section chiefs to arrive, appeared in the screener\noutside the door.\n\n\"Roy? It's me--Percy.\"\n\n\"I can see you. Come on in, Lee.\"\n\nPercy was in charge of public relations for Popeek. He was a tall,\nangular man with thick corrugated features.\n\nAfter him came Teddy Schaunhaft, clinic coordinator; Pauline Medhurst,\npersonnel director; Olaf Eglin, director of field agents; and Sue\nLlewellyn, Popeek's comptroller.\n\nThese five had constituted the central council of Popeek. Walton, as\nassistant administrator, had served as their coordinator, as well as\nhandling population transfer and serving as a funnel for red tape.\nAbove them all had been FitzMaugham, brooding over his charges like an\nuntroubled Wotan; FitzMaugham had reserved for himself, aside from the\ntask of general supervision, the special duties attendant on handling\nthe terraforming and faster-than-light wings of Popeek.\n\n\"I should have called you together much earlier than this,\" Walton said\nwhen they were settled. \"The shock, though, and the general confusion--\"\n\n\"We understand, Roy,\" said Sue Llewellyn sympathetically. She\nwas a chubby little woman in her fifties, whose private life was\nreported to be incredibly at variance with her pleasantly domestic\nappearance. \"It's been rough on all of us, but you were so close to Mr.\nFitzMaugham....\"\n\nThere was sympathetic clucking from various corners of the room. Walton\nsaid, \"The period of mourning will have to be a brief one. What I'm\nsuggesting is that business continue as usual, without a hitch.\" He\nglanced at Eglin, the director of field agents. \"Olaf, is there a man\nin your section capable of handling your job?\"\n\nEglin looked astonished for a moment, then mastered himself. \"There\nmust be five, at least. Walters, Lassen, Dominic--\"\n\n\"Skip the catalogue,\" Walton told him. \"Pick the man you think is best\nsuited to replace you, and send his dossier up to me for approval.\"\n\n\"And where do _I_ go?\"\n\n\"You take over my slot as assistant administrator. As director of field\nagents, you're more familiar with the immediate problems of my old job\nthan anyone else here.\"\n\nEglin preened himself smugly. Walton wondered if he had made an unwise\nchoice; Eglin was competent enough, and would give forth one hundred\npercent effort at all times--but probably never the one hundred two\npercent a really great administrator could put out when necessary.\n\nStill, the post had to be filled at once, and Eglin could pick up the\nreins faster than any of the others.\n\nWalton looked around. \"Otherwise, activities of Popeek will continue as\nunder Mr. FitzMaugham, without a hitch. Any questions?\"\n\nLee Percy raised an arm slowly. \"Roy, I've got a problem I'd like to\nbring up here, as long as we're all together. There's a growing public\nsentiment that you and the late director were secretly Herschelites.\"\nHe chuckled apologetically. \"I know it sounds silly, but I just report\nwhat I hear.\"\n\n\"I'm familiar with the rumor,\" Walton said. \"And I don't like it much,\neither. That's the sort of stuff riots are made of.\"\n\nThe Herschelites were extremists who advocated wholesale sterilization\nof defectives, mandatory birth control, and half a dozen other\nstringent remedies for overpopulation.\n\n\"What steps are you taking to counteract it?\" Walton asked.\n\n\"Well,\" said Percy, \"we're preparing a memorial program for FitzMaugham\nwhich will intimate that he was murdered by the Herschelites, who hated\nhim.\"\n\n\"Good. What's the slant?\"\n\n\"That he was too easygoing, too humane. We build up the Herschelites as\nultrareactionaries who intend to enforce their will on humanity if they\nget the chance, and imply FitzMaugham was fighting them tooth and nail.\nWe close the show with some shots of you picking up the great man's\nmantle, etcetera, etcetera. And a short speech from you affirming the\nbasically humanitarian aims of Popeek.\"\n\nWalton smiled approvingly and said, \"I like it. When do you want me to\ndo the speech?\"\n\n\"We won't need you,\" Percy told him. \"We've got plenty of stock\nfootage, and we can whip the speech out of some spare syllables you\nleft around.\"\n\nWalton frowned. Too many of the public speeches of the day were\nsynthetic, created by skilled engineers who split words into their\ncomponent phonemes and reassembled them in any shape they pleased. \"Let\nme check through my speech before you put it over, at least.\"\n\n\"Will do. And we'll squash this Herschelite thing right off the bat.\"\n\nPauline Medhurst squirmed uneasily in her chair. Walton caught the hint\nand recognized her.\n\n\"Uh, Roy, I don't know if this is the time or the place, but I got that\ntransfer order of yours, the five doctors....\"\n\n\"You did? Good,\" Walton said hurriedly. \"Have you notified them yet?\"\n\n\"Yes. They seemed unhappy about it.\"\n\n\"Refer them to FitzMaugham's book. Tell them they're cogs in a mighty\nmachine, working to save humanity. We can't let personal considerations\ninterefere, Pauline.\"\n\n\"If you could only explain why--\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" interjected Schaunhaft, the clinic coordinator suddenly. \"You\ncleaned out my whole morning lab shift down there. I was wondering--\"\n\nWalton felt like a stag at bay. \"Look,\" he said firmly, cutting\nthrough the hubbub, \"_I_ made the transfer. I had reasons for doing\nit. It's your job to get the five men out where they've been assigned,\nand to get five new men in here at once. You're not required to make\nexplanations to them--nor I to you.\"\n\nSudden silence fell over the office. Walton hoped he had not been too\nforceful, and cast suspicion on his actions by his stiffness.\n\n\"Whew!\" Sue Llewellyn said. \"You really mean business!\"\n\n\"I said we were going to run Popeek without a hitch,\" Walton replied.\n\"Just because you know my first name, that doesn't mean I'm not going\nto be as strong a director as FitzMaugham was.\"\n\n_Until the UN picks my successor_, his mind added. Out loud he said,\n\"Unless you have any further questions, I'll ask you now to return to\nyour respective sections.\"\n\nHe sat slumped at his desk after they were gone, trying to draw on some\ninner reserve of energy for the strength to go on.\n\nOne day at the job, and he was tired, terribly tired. And it would be\nsix weeks or more before the United Nations convened to choose the next\ndirector of Popeek.\n\nHe didn't know who that man would be. He expected they would offer the\njob to him, provided he did competent work during the interim; but,\nwearily, he saw he would have to turn the offer down.\n\nIt was not only that his nerves couldn't handle the grinding daily\ntension of the job; he saw now what Fred might be up to, and it stung.\n\nWhat if his brother were to hold off exposing him until the moment the\nUN proffered its appointment ... and then took that moment to reveal\nthat the head of Popeek, far from being an iron-minded Herschelite, had\nactually been guilty of an irregularity that transgressed against one\nof Popeek's own operations? He'd be finished. He'd be laughed out of\npublic life for good--and probably prosecuted in the bargain--if Fred\nexposed him.\n\nAnd Fred was perfectly capable of doing just that.\n\nWalton saw himself spinning dizzily between conflicting alternatives.\nKeep the job and face his brother's expos\u00e9? Or resign, and vanish into\nanonymity. Neither choice seemed too appealing.\n\nShrugging, he dragged himself out of his chair, determined to shroud\nhis conflict behind the mask of work. He typed a request to Files,\nrequisitioning data on the faster-than-light project.\n\nMoments later, the torrent began--rising from somewhere in the depths\nof the giant computer, rumbling upward through the conveyor system,\nmoving onward toward the twenty-ninth floor and the office of Interim\nDirector Walton.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nThe next morning there was a crowd gathered before the Cullen Building\nwhen Walton arrived.\n\nThere must have been at least a hundred people, fanning outward from a\ncentral focus. Walton stepped from the jetbus and, with collar pulled\nup carefully to obscure as much of his face as possible, went to\ninvestigate.\n\nA small red-faced man stood on a rickety chair against the side of the\nbuilding. He was flanked by a pair of brass flagpoles, one bearing the\nAmerican flag and the other the ensign of the United Nations. His voice\nwas a biting rasp--probably, thought Walton, intensified, sharpened,\nand made more irritating by a harmonic modulator at his throat. An\nirritating voice put its message across twice as fast as a pleasant one.\n\nHe was shouting, \"This is the place! Up here, in this building, that's\nwhere they are! That's where Popeek wastes our money!\"\n\nFrom the slant of the man's words Walton instantly thought:\n_Herschelite!_\n\nHe repressed his anger and, for once, decided to stay and hear the\nextremist out. He had never really paid much attention to Herschelite\npropaganda--he had been exposed to little of it--and he realized\nthat now, as head of Popeek, he owed it to himself to become familiar\nwith the anti-Popeek arguments of both extremist factions--those who\ninsisted Popeek was a tyranny, and the Herschelites, who thought it was\ntoo weak.\n\n\"This Popeek,\" the little man said, accenting the awkwardness of the\nword. \"You know what it is? It's a stopgap. It's a silly, soft-minded,\nhalf-hearted attempt at solving our problems. It's a fake, a fraud, a\nphony!\"\n\nThere was real passion behind the words. Walton distrusted small men\nwith deep wells of passion; he no more enjoyed their company than he\ndid that of a dynamo or an atomic pile. They were always threatening to\nexplode.\n\nThe crowd was stirring restlessly. The Herschelite was getting to them,\none way or another. Walton drew back nervously, not wanting to be\nrecognized, and stationed himself at the fringe of the crowd.\n\n\"Some of you don't like Popeek for this reason or that reason. But let\nme tell you something, friends ... you're wronger than they are! We've\ngot to get tough with ourselves! We have to face the truth! Popeek is\nan unrealistic half-solution to man's problems. Until we limit birth,\nestablish rigid controls over who's going to live and who isn't, we--\"\n\nIt was straight Herschelite propaganda, undiluted. Walton wasn't\nsurprised when someone in the audience interrupted, growling, \"And\nwho's going to set those controls? You?\"\n\n\"You trusted yourselves to Popeek, didn't you? Why hesitate, then, to\ntrust yourselves to Abel Herschel and his group of workers for the\nbetterment and purification of mankind?\"\n\nWalton was almost limp with amazement. The Herschelite group was so\nmuch more drastic in its approach than Popeek that he wondered how they\ndared come out with these views in public. Animosity was high enough\nagainst Popeek; would the public accept a group more stringent yet?\n\nThe little man's voice rose high. \"Onward with the Herschelites!\nMankind must move forward! The Equalization people represent the forces\nof decay and sloth!\"\n\nWalton turned to the man next to him and murmured, \"But Herschel's a\nfanatic. They'll kill all of us in the name of mankind.\"\n\nThe man looked puzzled; then, accepting the idea, he nodded. \"Yeah,\nbuddy. You know, you may have something there.\"\n\nThat was all the spark needed. Walton edged away surreptitiously and\nwatched it spread through the crowd, while the little man's harangue\ngrew more and more inflammatory.\n\nUntil a rock arced through the air from somewhere, whipped across the\nbillowing UN flag, and cracked into the side of the building. That was\nthe signal.\n\nA hundred men and women converged on the little man on the battered\nchair. \"_We have to face the truth!_\" the harsh voice cried; then\nthe flags were swept down, trampled on. Flagpoles fell, ringing\nmetallically on the concrete; the chair toppled. The little man was\nlost beneath a tide of remorseless feet and arms.\n\nA siren screamed.\n\n\"Cops!\" Walton yelled from his vantage point some thirty feet away, and\nabruptly the crowd melted away in all directions, leaving Walton and\nthe little man alone on the street. A security wagon drew up. Four men\nin gray uniforms sprang out.\n\n\"What's been going on here? Who's this man?\" Then, seeing Walton, \"Hey!\nCome over here!\"\n\n\"Of course, officer.\" Walton turned his collar down and drew near. He\nspotted the glare of a ubiquitous video camera and faced it squarely.\n\"I'm Director Walton of Popeek,\" he said loudly, into the camera. \"I\njust arrived here a few minutes ago. I saw the whole thing.\"\n\n\"Tell us about it, Mr. Walton,\" the security man said.\n\n\"It was a Herschelite.\" Walton gestured at the broken body crumpled\nagainst the ground. \"He was delivering an inflammatory speech aimed\nagainst Popeek, with special reference to the late Director FitzMaugham\nand myself. I was about to summon you and end the disturbance, when\nthe listeners became aware that the man was a Herschelite. When they\nunderstood what he was advocating, they--well, you see the result.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir. Terribly sorry we couldn't have prevented it. Must be\nvery unpleasant, Mr. Walton.\"\n\n\"The man was asking for trouble,\" Walton said. \"Popeek represents\nthe minds and hearts of the world. Herschel and his people seek to\noverthrow this order. I can't condone violence of any sort, naturally,\nbut\"--he smiled into the camera--\"Popeek is a sacred responsibility to\nme. Its enemies I must regard as blind and misguided people.\"\n\nHe turned and entered the building, feeling pleased with himself. That\nsequence would be shown globally on the next news screenings; every\nnewsblare in the world would be reporting his words.\n\nLee Percy would be proud of him. Without benefit either of rehearsal or\nphonemic engineering, Walton had delivered a rousing speech and turned\na grisly incident into a major propaganda instrument.\n\nAnd more than that, Director FitzMaugham would have been proud of him.\n\nBut beneath the glow of pride, he was trembling. Yesterday he had saved\na boy by a trifling alteration of his genetic record; today he had\nkilled a man by sending a whispered accusation rustling through a mob.\n\n_Power._ Popeek represented power, perhaps the greatest power in the\nworld. That power would have to be channeled somehow, now that it had\nbeen unleashed.\n\nThe stack of papers relating to the superspeed space drive was still on\nhis desk when he entered the office. He had had time yesterday to read\nthrough just some of the earliest; then, the pressure of routine had\ndragged him off to other duties.\n\nEncouraged by FitzMaugham, the faster-than-light project had\noriginated about a decade or so before. It stemmed from the fact that\nthe ion-drive used for travel between planets had a top velocity, a\nlimiting factor of about ninety thousand miles per second. At that\nrate, it would take some eighteen years for a scouting party to visit\nthe closest star and report back ... not very efficient for a planet in\na hurry to expand outward.\n\nA group of scientists had set to work developing a subspace warp drive,\none that would cut across the manifold of normal space and allow speeds\nabove light velocity.\n\nAll the records were here: the preliminary trials, the budget\nallocations, the sketches and plans, the names of the researchers.\nWalton ploughed painstakingly through them, learning names,\nassimilating scientific data. It seemed that, while it was still in its\nearly stages, FitzMaugham had nurtured the project along with money\nfrom his personal fortune.\n\nFor most of the morning Walton leafed through documents describing\nprojected generators, types of hull material, specifications,\nspeculations. It was nearly noon when he came across the neatly-typed\nnote from Colonel Leslie McLeod, one of the military scientists in\ncharge of the ultradrive project. Walton read it through once, gasped,\nand read it again.\n\nIt was dated 14 June 2231, almost one year ago. It read:\n\n    _My dear Mr. FitzMaugham:_\n\n    _I'm sure it will gladden you to learn that we have at last achieved\n    success in our endeavors. The X-72 passed its last tests splendidly,\n    and we are ready to leave on the preliminary scouting flight at\n    once._\n\n    McLeod\n\nIt was followed by a note from FitzMaugham to McLeod, dated 15 June:\n\n    _Dr. McLeod:_\n\n    _All best wishes on your great adventure. I trust you'll be\n    departing, as usual, from the Nairobi base within the next few days.\n    Please let me hear from you before departure._\n\n    _FitzM._\n\nThe file concluded with a final note from McLeod to the director, dated\n19 June 2231:\n\n    _My dear Mr. FitzMaugham:_\n\n    _The X-72 will leave Nairobi in eleven hours, bound outward, manned\n    by a crew of sixteen, including myself. The men are all impatient\n    for the departure. I must offer my hearty thanks for the help you\n    have given us over the past years, without which we would never have\n    reached this step._\n\n    _Flight plans include visiting several of the nearer stars, with\n    the intention of returning either as soon as we have discovered a\n    habitable extrasolar world, or one year after departure, whichever\n    first occurs._\n\n    _Sincere good wishes, and may you have as much success when you\n    plead your case before the United Nations as we have had\n    here--though you'll forgive me for hoping that our work might make\n    any population equalization program on Earth totally superfluous!_\n\n    _McLeod_\n\nWalton stared at the three notes for a moment, so shocked he was unable\nto react. So a faster-than-light drive was not merely a hoped-for\ndream, but an actuality--with the first scouting mission a year absent\nalready!\n\nHe felt a new burst of admiration for FitzMaugham. What a marvelous old\nscoundrel he had been!\n\nFaster-than-light achieved, and the terraforming group on Venus, and\nneither fact released to the public ... or even specifically given to\nFitzMaugham's own staff, his alleged confidants.\n\nIt had been shrewd of him, all right. He had made sure nothing could\ngo wrong. If something happened to Lang and his crew on Venus--and it\nwas quite possible, since word from them was a week overdue--it would\nbe easy to say that the terraforming project was still in the planning\nstage. In the event of success, the excuse was that word of their\nprogress had been withheld for \"security reasons.\"\n\nAnd the same would apply to the space drive; if McLeod and his men\nvanished into the nether regions of interstellar space and never\nreturned, FitzMaugham would not have had to answer for the failure of\na project which, as far as the public knew, was still in the planning\nstage. It was a double-edged sword with the director controlling both\nedges.\n\nAnd now Walton was in charge. He hoped he would be able to continue\nmanipulations with an aplomb worthy of the late Director FitzMaugham.\n\nThe annunciator chimed. \"Dr. Lamarre is here for his appointment with\nyou, Mr. Walton.\"\n\nWalton was caught off guard. His mind raced furiously. _Lamarre? Who\nthe dickens--oh, that left-over appointment of FitzMaugham's._\n\n\"Tell Dr. Lamarre I'll be glad to see him in just a few minutes,\nplease. I'll buzz you when I'm ready.\"\n\nHurriedly he gathered up the space-flight documents and jammed them in\na file drawer near the data on terraforming. He surveyed his office;\nit looked neat, presentable. Glancing around, he made sure no stray\ndocuments were visible, documents which might reveal the truth about\nthe space drive.\n\n\"Send in Dr. Lamarre,\" he said.\n\nDr. Lamarre was a short, thin, pale individual, with an uncertain wave\nin his sandy hair and a slight stoop of his shoulders. He carried a\nlarge, black leather portfolio which seemed on the point of exploding.\n\n\"Mr. Walton?\"\n\n\"That's right. You're Dr. Lamarre?\"\n\nThe small man handed him an engraved business card.\n\n                          _T. ELLIOT LAMARRE_\n                            _Gerontologist_\n\nWalton fingered the card uneasily and returned it to its owner.\n\"Gerontologist? One who studies ways of increasing the human life-span?\"\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\nWalton frowned. \"I presume you've had some previous dealings with the\nlate Director FitzMaugham?\"\n\nLamarre gaped. \"You mean he didn't _tell_ you?\"\n\n\"Director FitzMaugham shared very little information with his\nassistants, Dr. Lamarre. The suddenness of my elevation to this post\ngave me little time to explore his files. Would you mind filling me in\non the background?\"\n\n\"Of course.\" Lamarre crossed his legs and squinted myopically across\nthe desk at Walton. \"To be brief, Mr. FitzMaugham first heard of my\nwork fourteen years ago. Since that time, he's supported my experiments\nwith private grants of his own, public appropriations whenever\npossible, and lately with money supplied by Popeek. Naturally, because\nof the nature of my work I've shunned publicity. I completed my final\ntests last week, and was to have seen the director yesterday. But--\"\n\n\"I know. I was busy going through Mr. FitzMaugham's files when you\ncalled yesterday. I didn't have time to see anyone.\" Walton wished he\nhad checked on this man Lamarre earlier. Apparently it was a private\nproject of FitzMaugham's and of some importance.\n\n\"May I ask what this 'work' of yours consists of?\"\n\n\"Certainly. Mr. FitzMaugham expressed a hope that someday man's life\nspan might be infinitely extended. I'm happy to report that I have\ndeveloped a simple technique which will provide just that.\" The little\nman smiled in self-satisfaction. \"In short,\" he said, \"what I have\ndeveloped, in everyday terms, is immortality, Mr. Walton.\"\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nWalton was becoming hardened to astonishment; the further he excavated\ninto the late director's affairs, the less susceptible he was to the\nvisceral reaction of shock.\n\nStill, this stunned him for a moment.\n\n\"Did you say you'd perfected this technique?\" he asked slowly. \"Or that\nit was still in the planning stage?\"\n\nLamarre tapped the thick, glossy black portfolio. \"In here. I've got it\nall.\" He seemed ready to burst with self-satisfaction.\n\nWalton leaned back, spread his fingers against the surface of the desk,\nand wrinkled his forehead. \"I've had this job since 1300 on the tenth,\nMr. Lamarre. That's exactly two days ago, minus half an hour. And in\nthat time I don't think I've had less than ten major shocks and half a\ndozen minor ones.\"\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"What I'm getting at is this: just why did Director FitzMaugham sponsor\nthis project of yours?\"\n\nLamarre looked blank. \"Because the director was a great humanitarian,\nof course. Because he felt that the human life was short, far too\nshort, and he wished his fellow men to enjoy long life. What other\nreason should there be?\"\n\n\"I know FitzMaugham was a great man ... I was his secretary for\nthree years.\" (_Though he never said a word about you, Dr. Lamarre_,\nWalton thought.) \"But to develop immortality at this stage of man's\nexistence....\" Walton shook his head. \"Tell me about your work, Dr.\nLamarre.\"\n\n\"It's difficult to sum up readily. I've fought degeneration of the\nbody on the cellular level, and my tests show a successful outcome.\nPhagocyte stimulation combined with--the data's all here, Mr. Walton. I\nneedn't run through it for you.\"\n\nHe began to hunt in the portfolio, fumbling for something. After a\nmoment he extracted a folded quarto sheet, spread it out, and nudged it\nacross the desk toward Walton.\n\nThe director glanced at the sheet; it was covered with chemical\nequations. \"Spare me the technical details, Dr. Lamarre. Have you\ntested your treatment yet?\"\n\n\"With the only test possible, the test of time. There are insects in my\nlaboratories that have lived five years or more--veritable Methuselahs\nof their genera. Immortality is not something one can test in less\nthan infinite time. But beneath the microscope, one can see the cells\nregenerating, one can see decay combated....\"\n\nWalton took a deep breath. \"Are you aware, Dr. Lamarre, that for the\nbenefit of humanity I really should have you shot at once?\"\n\n\"_What?_\"\n\nWalton nearly burst out laughing; the man looked outrageously funny\nwith that look of shocked incomprehension on his face. \"Do you\nunderstand what immortality would do to Earth?\" he asked. \"With no\nother planet of the solar system habitable by man, and none of the\nstars within reach? Within a generation we'd be living ten to the\nsquare inch. We'd--\"\n\n\"Director FitzMaugham was aware of these things,\" Lamarre interrupted\nsharply. \"He had no intention of administering my discovery wholesale\nto the populace. What's more, he was fully confident that a\nfaster-than-light space drive would soon let us reach the planets, and\nthat the terraforming engineers would succeed with their work on Venus.\"\n\n\"Those two factors are still unknowns in the equation,\" Walton said.\n\"Neither has succeeded, as of now. And we can't possibly let word of\nyour discovery get out until there are avenues to handle the overflow\nof population already on hand.\"\n\n\"So you propose--\"\n\n\"To confiscate the notes you have with you, and to insist that you\nremain silent about this serum of yours until I give you permission to\nannounce it.\"\n\n\"And if I refuse?\"\n\nWalton spread his hands. \"Dr. Lamarre, I'm a reasonable man trying to\ndo a very hard job. You're a scientist--and a sane one, I hope. I'd\nappreciate your cooperation. Bear with me a few weeks, and then perhaps\nthe situation will change.\"\n\nAwkward silence followed. Finally Lamarre said, \"Very well. If you'll\nreturn my notes, I promise to keep silent until you give me permission\nto speak.\"\n\n\"That won't be enough. I'll need to keep the notes.\"\n\nLamarre sighed. \"If you insist,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen he was again alone, Walton stored the thick portfolio in a file\ndrawer and stared at it quizzically.\n\n_FitzMaugham_, he thought, _you were incredible!_\n\nLamarre's immortality serum, or whatever it was, was deadly. Whether\nit actually worked or not was irrelevant. If word ever escaped that an\nimmortality drug existed, there would be rioting and death on a vast\nscale.\n\nFitzMaugham had certainly seen that, and yet he had sublimely\nunderwritten development of the serum, knowing that if terraforming and\nthe ultradrive project should fail, Lamarre's project represented a\nmajor threat to civilization.\n\nWell, Lamarre had knuckled under to Walton willingly enough. The\nproblem now was to contact Lang on Venus and find out what was\nhappening up there....\n\n\"Mr. Walton,\" said the annunciator. \"There's a coded message arriving\nfor Director FitzMaugham.\"\n\n\"Where from?\"\n\n\"From space, sir. They say they have news, but they won't give it to\nanyone but Mr. FitzMaugham.\"\n\nWalton cursed. \"Where is this message being received?\"\n\n\"Floor twenty-three, sir. Communications.\"\n\n\"Tell them I'll be right down,\" Walton snapped.\n\nHe caught a lift tube and arrived on the twenty-third floor moments\nlater. No sooner had the tube door opened than he sprang out, dodging\naround a pair of startled technicians, and sprinted down the corridor\ntoward communications.\n\nHere throbbed the network that held the branches of Popeek together.\nFrom here the screens were powered, the annunciators were linked, the\nphones connected.\n\nWalton pushed open a door marked _Communications Central_ and\nconfronted four busy engineers who were crowded around a complex\nreceiving mechanism.\n\n\"Where's that space message?\" he demanded of the sallow young engineer\nwho approached him.\n\n\"Still coming in, sir. They're repeating it over and over. We're\ntriangulating their position now. Somewhere near the orbit of Pluto,\nMr. Walton.\"\n\n\"Devil with that. Where's the message?\"\n\nSomeone handed him a slip of paper. It said, _Calling Earth. Urgent\ncall, top urgency, crash urgency. Will communicate only with D. F.\nFitzMaugham._\n\n\"This all it is?\" Walton asked. \"No signature, no ship name?\"\n\n\"That's right, Mr. Walton.\"\n\n\"Okay. Find them in a hurry and send them a return message. Tell them\nFitzMaugham's dead and I'm his successor. Mention me by name.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nHe stamped impatiently around the lab while they set to work beaming\nthe message into the void. Space communication was a field that dazzled\nand bewildered Walton, and he watched in awe as they swung into\noperation.\n\nTime passed. \"You know of any ships supposed to be in that sector?\" he\nasked someone.\n\n\"No, sir. We weren't expecting any calls except from Lang on Venus--\"\nThe technician gasped, realizing he had made a slip, and turned pale.\n\n\"That's all right,\" Walton assured him. \"I'm the director, remember? I\nknow all about Lang.\"\n\n\"Of course, sir.\"\n\n\"Here's a reply, sir,\" another of the nameless, faceless technicians\nsaid. Walton scanned it.\n\nIt read, _Hello Walton. Request further identification before we\nreport. McL._\n\nA little shudder of satisfaction shook Walton at the sight of the\ninitialed _McL._ at the end of the message. That could mean only\nMcLeod--and _that_ could mean only one thing: the experimental starship\nhad returned!\n\nWalton realized depressedly that this probably implied that they\nhadn't found any Earth-type worlds among the stars. McLeod's note to\nFitzMaugham had said they would search for a year, and would return\nhome at the end of that time if they had no success. And just about a\nyear had elapsed.\n\nHe said, \"Send this return message: McLeod, Nairobi, X-72.\nCongratulations! Walton.\"\n\nThe technician vanished again, leaving Walton alone. He gazed moodily\nat the complex maze of equipment all around him, listened to the steady\n_tick-tick_ of the communication devices, strained his ears to pick up\nfragments of conversation from the men.\n\nAfter what seemed like an hour, the technician returned. \"There's a\nmessage coming through now, sir. We're decoding it as fast as we can.\"\n\n\"Make it snappy,\" Walton said. His watch read 1429. Only twenty minutes\nhad passed since he had gone down there.\n\nA grimy sheet of paper was thrust under his nose. He read it:\n\n    _Hello Walton, this is McLeod. Happy to report that experimental\n    ship X-72 is returning home with all hands in good shape, after\n    a remarkable one-year cruise of the galaxy. I feel like Ulysses\n    returning to Ithaca, except we didn't have such a hard time of it._\n\n    _I imagine you'll be interested in this: we found a perfectly\n    lovely and livable world in the Procyon system. No intelligent life\n    at all, and incredibly fine climate. Pity old FitzMaugham couldn't\n    have lived to hear about it. Be seeing you soon. McLeod._\n\nWalton's hands were still shaking as he pressed the actuator that would\nlet him back into his office. He would have to call another meeting of\nthe section chiefs again, to discuss the best method of presenting this\nexciting news to the world.\n\nFor one thing, they would have to explain away FitzMaugham's failure\nto reveal that the X-72 had been sent out over a year ago. That could\nbe easily handled.\n\nThen, there would have to be a careful build-up: descriptions of the\nnew world, profiles of the heroes who had found it, etcetera. Someone\nwas going to have to work out a plan for emigration ... unless the\nresourceful FitzMaugham had already drawn up such a plan and stowed it\nin Files for just this anticipated day.\n\nAnd then, perhaps Lamarre could be called back now, and allowed to\nrelease his discovery. Plans buzzed in Walton's mind: in the event that\npeople proved reluctant to leave Earth and conquer an unknown world,\nno matter how tempting the climate, it might be feasible to dangle\nimmortality before them--to restrict Lamarre's treatment to volunteer\ncolonists, or something along that line. There was plenty of time to\nfigure that out, Walton thought.\n\nHe stepped into his office and locked the door behind him. A glow of\npleasure surrounded him; for once it seemed that things were heading in\nthe right direction. He was happy, in a way, that FitzMaugham was no\nlonger in charge. Now, with mankind on the threshold of--\n\nWalton blinked. _Did I leave that file drawer open when I left the\noffice?_ he wondered. He was usually more cautious than that.\n\nThe file was definitely open now, as were the two cabinets adjoining\nit. Numbly he swung the cabinet doors wider, peered into the shadows,\ngroped inside.\n\nThe drawers containing the documents pertaining to terraforming and to\nMcLeod's space drive seemed intact. But the cabinet in which Walton had\nplaced Lamarre's portfolio--that cabinet was totally empty!\n\n_Someone's been in here_, he thought angrily. And then the anger\nchanged to agony as he remembered what had been in Lamarre's portfolio,\nand what would happen if that formula were loosed indiscriminately in\nthe world.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nThe odd part of it, Walton thought, was that there was absolutely\nnothing he could do.\n\nHe could call Sellors and give him a roasting for not guarding his\noffice properly, but that wouldn't restore the missing portfolio.\n\nHe could send out a general alarm, and thereby let the world know that\nthere was such a thing as Lamarre's formula. That would be catastrophic.\n\nWalton slammed the cabinet shut and spun the lock. Then, heavily,\nhe dropped into his chair and rested his head in his arms. All the\njubilation of a few moments before had suddenly melted into dull\napprehension.\n\nSuspects? Just two--Lamarre, and Fred. Lamarre because he was obvious;\nFred because he was likely to do anything to hurt his brother.\n\n\"Give me Sellors in security,\" Walton said quietly.\n\nSellors' bland face appeared on the screen. He blinked at the sight of\nWalton, causing Walton to wonder just how ghastly his own appearance\nwas; even with the executive filter touching up the transmitted image,\nsprucing him up and falsifying him for the public benefit, he probably\nlooked dreadful.\n\n\"Sellors, I want you to send out a general order for a Dr. Lamarre.\nYou'll find his appearance recorded on the entrance tapes for today;\nhe came to see me earlier. The first name is--ah--Elliot. T. Elliot\nLamarre, gerontologist. I don't know where he lives.\"\n\n\"What should I do when I find him, sir?\"\n\n\"Bring him here at once. And if you catch him at home, slap a seal\non his door. He may be in possession of some very important secret\ndocuments.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"And get hold of the doorsmith who repaired my office door; I want the\nlock calibration changed at once.\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir.\"\n\nThe screen faded. Walton turned back to his desk and busied himself in\nmeaningless paper work, trying to keep himself from thinking.\n\nA few moments later the screen brightened again. It was Fred.\n\nWalton stared coldly at his brother's image. \"Well?\"\n\nFred chuckled. \"Why so pale and wan, dear brother? Disappointed in\nlove?\"\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\n\"An audience with His Highness the Interim Director, if it please His\nGrace.\" Fred grinned unpleasantly. \"A private, audience, if you please,\nm'lord.\"\n\n\"Very well. Come on up here.\"\n\nFred shook his head. \"Sorry, no go. There are too many tricky spy\npickups in that office of yours. Let's meet elsewhere, shall we?\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"That club you belong to. The Bronze Room.\"\n\nWalton sputtered. \"But I can't leave the building now! There's no one\nwho--\"\n\n\"Now,\" Fred interrupted. \"The Bronze Room. It's in the San Isidro,\nisn't it? Top of Neville Prospect?\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Walton resignedly. \"There's a doorsmith coming up\nhere to do some work. Give me a minute to cancel the assignment and\nI'll meet you downstairs.\"\n\n\"You leave now,\" Fred said. \"I'll arrive five minutes after you. And\nyou won't need to cancel anything. _I_ was the doorsmith.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNeville Prospect was the most fashionable avenue in all of New York\nCity, a wide strip of ferroconcrete running up the West Side between\nEleventh Avenue and the West Side Drive from Fortieth to Fiftieth\nStreet. It was bordered on both sides by looming apartment buildings in\nwhich a man of wealth might have as many as four or five rooms to his\nsuite; and at the very head of the Prospect, facing down-town, was the\nmighty San Isidro, a buttressed fortress of gleaming metal and stone\nwhose mighty, beryllium-steel supports swept out in a massive arc five\nhundred feet in either direction.\n\nOn the hundred fiftieth floor of the San Isidro was the exclusive\nBronze Room, from whose quartz windows might be seen all the sprawling\nbusyness of Manhattan and the close-packed confusion of New Jersey just\nacross the river.\n\nThe jetcopter delivered Walton to the landing-stage of the Bronze\nRoom; he tipped the man too much and stepped within. A door of dull\nbronze confronted him. He touched his key to the signet plate; the door\npivoted noiselessly inward, admitting him.\n\nThe color scheme today was gray: gray light streamed from the\nluminescent walls, gray carpets lay underfoot, gray tables with gray\ndishes were visible in the murky distance. A gray-clad waiter, hardly\nmore than four feet tall, sidled up to Walton.\n\n\"Good to see you again, sir,\" he murmured. \"You have not been here of\nlate.\"\n\n\"No,\" Walton said. \"I've been busy.\"\n\n\"A terrible tragedy, the death of Mr. FitzMaugham. He was one of our\nmost esteemed members. Will you have your usual room today, sir?\"\n\nWalton shook his head. \"I'm entertaining a guest--my brother, Fred.\nWe'll need a compartment for two. He'll identify himself when he\narrives.\"\n\n\"Of course. Come with me, please.\"\n\nThe gnome led him through a gray haze to another bronze door, down a\ncorridor lined with antique works of art, through an interior room\ndecorated with glowing lumi-facts of remarkable quality, past a broad\nquartz window so clean as to be dizzyingly invisible, and up to a\nnarrow door with a bright red signet plate in its center.\n\n\"For you, sir.\"\n\nWalton touched his key to the signet plate; the door crumpled like a\nfan. He stepped inside, gravely handed the gnome a bill, and closed the\ndoor.\n\nThe room was tastefully furnished, again in gray; the Bronze Room was\nalways uniformly monochromatic, though the hue varied with the day and\nwith the mood of the city. Walton had long speculated on what the club\nprecincts would be like were the electronic magic disconnected.\n\nActually, he knew, none of the Bronze Room's appurtenances had any\ncolor except when the hand in the control room threw the switch. The\nclub held many secrets. It was FitzMaugham who had brought about\nWalton's admission to the club, and Walton had been deeply grateful.\n\nHe was in a room just comfortably large enough for two, with a single\nbright window facing the Hudson, a small onyx table, a tiny screen\ntastefully set in the wall, and a bar. He dialed himself a filtered\nrum, his favorite drink. The dark, cloudy liquid came pouring instantly\nfrom the spigot.\n\nThe screen suddenly flashed a wave of green, breaking the ubiquitous\ngrayness. The green gave way to the bald head and scowling face of\nKroll, the Bronze Room's door-man.\n\n\"Sir, there is a man outside who claims to be your brother. He alleges\nhe has an appointment with you here.\"\n\n\"That's right, Kroll; send him in. Fulks will bring him to my room.\"\n\n\"Just one moment, sir. First it is needful to verify.\" Kroll's face\nvanished and Fred's appeared.\n\n\"Is this the man?\" Kroll's voice asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Walton said. \"You can send my brother in.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFred seemed a little dazed by the opulence. He sat gingerly on the\nedge of the foamweb couch, obviously attempting to appear blas\u00e9 and\npainfully conscious of his failure to do so.\n\n\"This is quite a place,\" he said finally.\n\nWalton smiled. \"A little on the palatial side for my tastes. I don't\ncome here often. The transition hurts too much when I go back outside.\"\n\n\"FitzMaugham got you in here, didn't he?\"\n\nWalton nodded.\n\n\"I thought so,\" Fred said. \"Well, maybe someday soon I'll be a member\ntoo. Then we can meet here more often. We don't see enough of each\nother, you know.\"\n\n\"Dial yourself a drink,\" Walton said. \"Then tell me what's on your\nmind--or were you just angling to get an invite up here?\"\n\n\"It was more than that. But let me get a drink before we begin.\"\n\nFred dialed a Weesuer, heavy on the absinthe, and took a few sampling\nsips before wheeling around to face Walton. He said, \"One of the minor\ntalents I acquired in the course of my wanderings was doorsmithing.\nIt's really not very difficult to learn, for a man who applies himself.\"\n\n\"You were the one who repaired my office door?\"\n\nFred smirked. \"I was. I wore a mask, of course, and my uniform\nwas borrowed. Masks are very handy things. They make them most\nconvincingly, nowadays. As, for instance, the one worn by the man who\nposed as Ludwig.\"\n\n\"What do you know about--\"\n\n\"_Nothing._ And that's the flat truth, Roy. I didn't kill FitzMaugham,\nand I don't know who did.\" He drained his drink and dialed another.\n\"No, the old man's death is as much of a mystery to me as it is to you.\nBut I have to thank you for wrecking the door so completely when you\nblasted your way in. It gave me a chance to make some repairs when I\nmost wanted to.\"\n\nWalton held himself very carefully in check. He knew exactly what Fred\nwas going to say in the next few minutes, but he refused to let himself\nprecipitate the conversation.\n\nWith studied care he rose, dialed another filtered rum for himself, and\ngently slid the initiator switch on the electroluminescent kaleidoscope\nembedded in the rear wall.\n\nA pattern of lights sprang into being--yellow, pale rose, blue, soft\ngreen. They wove together, intertwined, sprang apart into a sharp\nhexagon, broke into a scatter-pattern, melted, seemed to fall to the\ncarpet in bright flakes.\n\n\"Shut that thing off!\" Fred snapped suddenly. \"Come on! Shut it! _Shut\nit!_\"\n\nWalton swung around. His brother was leaning forward intently, eyes\nclamped tight shut. \"Is it off?\" Fred asked. \"Tell me!\"\n\nShrugging, Walton canceled the signal and the lights faded. \"You can\nopen your eyes, now. It's off.\"\n\nCautiously Fred opened his eyes. \"None of your fancy tricks, Roy!\"\n\n\"Trick?\" Walton asked innocently. \"What trick? Simple decoration,\nthat's all--and quite lovely, too. Just like the kaleidowhirls you've\nseen on video.\"\n\nFred shook his head. \"It's not the same thing. How do I know it's not\nsome sort of hypnoscreen? How do I know what those lights can do?\"\n\nWalton realized his brother was unfamiliar with wall kaleidoscopes.\n\"It's perfectly harmless,\" he said. \"But if you don't want it on, we\ncan do without it.\"\n\n\"Good. That's the way I like it.\"\n\nWalton observed that Fred's cool confidence seemed somewhat shaken.\nHis brother had made a tactical error in insisting on holding their\ninterview here, where Walton had so much the upper hand.\n\n\"May I ask again why you wanted to see me?\" Walton said.\n\n\"There are those people,\" Fred said slowly, \"who oppose the entire\nprinciple of population equalization.\"\n\n\"I'm aware of that. Some of them are members of this very club.\"\n\n\"Exactly. Some of them are. The ones I mean are the gentry, those still\nlucky enough to cling to land and home. The squire with a hundred acres\nin the Matto Grosso; the wealthy landowner of Liberia; the gentleman\nwho controls the rubber output of one of the lesser Indonesian islands.\nThese people, Roy, are unhappy over equalization. They know that sooner\nor later you and your Bureau will find out about them and will equalize\nthem ... say, by installing a hundred Chinese on a private estate, or\nby using a private river for a nuclear turbine. You'll have to admit\nthat their dislike of equalization is understandable.\"\n\n\"Everyone's dislike of equalization is understandable,\" Walton said. \"I\ndislike it myself. You got your evidence of that two days ago. No one\nlikes to give up special privileges.\"\n\n\"You see my point, then. There are perhaps a hundred of these men in\nclose contact with each other--\"\n\n\"_What!_\"\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" Fred said. \"A league. A conspiracy, it might almost be\ncalled. Very, very shady doings.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I work for them,\" Fred said.\n\nWalton let that soak in. \"You're an employee of Popeek,\" he said. \"Are\nyou inferring that you're both an employee of Popeek and an employee\nof a group that seeks to undermine Popeek?\"\n\nFred grinned proudly. \"That's the position on the nose. It calls for\nremarkable compartmentalization of mind. I think I manage nicely.\"\n\nIncredulously Walton said, \"How long has this been going on?\"\n\n\"Ever since I came to Popeek. This group is older than Popeek. They\nfought equalization all the way, and lost. Now they're working from\nthe bottom up and trying to wreck things before you catch wise and\nconfiscate their estates, as you're now legally entitled to do.\"\n\n\"And now that you've warned me they exist,\" Walton said, \"you can be\nassured that that's the first thing I'll do. The second thing I'll do\nwill be to have the security men track down their names and find out if\nthere was an actual conspiracy. If there was, it's jail for them. And\nthe third thing I'll do is discharge you from Popeek.\"\n\nFred shook his head. \"You won't do any of those things, Roy. You can't.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I know something about you that wouldn't look good if it came out\nin the open. Something that would get you bounced out of your high\nposition in a flash.\"\n\n\"Not fast enough to stop me from setting the wheels going. My successor\nwould continue the job of rooting out your league of landed gentry.\"\n\n\"I doubt that,\" Fred said calmly. \"I doubt it very much--because _I'm_\ngoing to be your successor.\"\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCrosscurrents of fear ran through Walton. He said, \"What are you\ntalking about?\"\n\nFred folded his arms complacently. \"I don't think it comes as news to\nyou that I broke into your office this morning while you were out. It\nwas very simple: when I installed the lock, I built in a canceling\ncircuit that would let me walk in whenever I pleased. And this morning\nI pleased. I was hoping to find something I could use as immediate\nleverage against you, but I hadn't expected anything as explosive as\nthe portfolio in the left-hand cabinet.\n\n\"Where is it?\"\n\nFred grinned sharply. \"The contents of that portfolio are now in very\nsafe keeping, Roy. Don't bluster and don't threaten, because it won't\nwork. I took precautions.\"\n\n\"And--\"\n\n\"And you know as well as I what would happen if that immortality serum\ngot distributed to the good old man in the street,\" Fred said. \"For one\nthing, there'd be a glorious panic. That would solve your population\nproblem for, a while, with millions killed in the rush. But after\nthat--where would you equalize, with every man and woman on Earth\nliving forever, and producing immortal children?\"\n\n\"We don't know the long-range effects yet--\"\n\n\"Don't temporize. You damned well know it'd be the biggest upheaval the\nworld has ever seen.\" Fred paused. \"My employers,\" he said, \"are in\npossession of the Lamarre formulas now.\"\n\n\"And with great glee are busy making themselves immortals.\"\n\n\"No. They don't trust the stuff, and won't use it until it's been\ntried on two or three billion guinea pigs. Human ones.\"\n\n\"They're not planning to release the serum, are they?\" Walton gasped.\n\n\"Not immediately,\" Fred said. \"In exchange for certain concessions\non your part, they're prepared to return Lamarre's portfolio to you\nwithout making use of it.\"\n\n\"Concessions? Such as what?\"\n\n\"That you refrain from declaring their private lands open territory for\nequalization. That you resign your post as interim director. That you\ngo before the General Assembly and recommend me as your successor.\"\n\n\"_You?_\"\n\n\"Who else is best fitted to serve the interests I represent?\"\n\nWalton leaned back, his face showing a mirth he scarcely felt. \"Very\nneat, Fred. But full of holes. First thing, what assurance have I that\nyour wealthy friends won't keep a copy of the Lamarre formula and use\nit as a bludgeon in the future against anyone they don't agree with?\"\n\n\"None,\" Fred admitted.\n\n\"Naturally. What's more, suppose I refuse to give in and your employers\nrelease the serum to all and sundry. Who gets hurt? Not me; I live in a\none-room box myself. But they'll be filling the world with billions and\nbillions of people. Their beloved estates will be overrun by the hungry\nmultitudes, whether they like it or not. And no fence will keep out a\nmillion hungry people.\"\n\n\"This is a risk they recognize,\" Fred said.\n\nWalton smiled triumphantly. \"You mean they're bluffing! They know they\ndon't dare release that serum, and they think they can get me out of\nthe way and you, their puppet, into office by making menacing noises.\nAll right. I'll call their bluff.\"\n\n\"You mean you refuse?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Walton said. \"I have no intention of resigning my interim\ndirectorship, and when the Assembly convenes I'm going to ask for the\njob on a permanent basis. They'll give it to me.\"\n\n\"And my evidence against you? The Prior baby?\"\n\n\"Hearsay. Propaganda. I'll laugh it right out of sight.\"\n\n\"Try laughing off the serum, Roy. It won't be so easy as all that.\"\n\n\"I'll manage,\" Walton said tightly. He crossed the room and jabbed down\non the communicator stud. The screen lit; the wizened face of the tiny\nservitor appeared.\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"Fulks, would you show this gentleman out of my chamber, please? He has\nno further wish to remain with me.\"\n\n\"Right away, Mr. Walton.\"\n\n\"Before you throw me out,\" Fred said, \"let me tell you one more thing.\"\n\n\"Go ahead.\"\n\n\"You're acting stupidly--though that's nothing new for you, Roy. I'll\ngive you a week's grace to make up your mind. Then the serum goes into\nproduction.\"\n\n\"My mind is made up,\" Walton said stiffly. The door telescoped and\nFulks stood outside. He smiled obsequiously at Walton, bowed to Fred,\nand said to him, \"Would you come with me, please?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was like one of those dreams, Walton thought, in which you were a\nbutler bringing dishes to the table, and the tray becomes obstinately\nstuck to your fingertips and refuses to be separated; or in which the\nCavendishes are dining in state and you come to the table nude; or in\nwhich you float downward perpetually with never a sign of bottom.\n\nThere never seemed to be any way out. Force opposed force and he seemed\ndoomed always to be caught in the middle.\n\nAngrily he snapped the kaleidoscope back on and let its everchanging\nswirl of color distract him. But in the depth of the deepest violet he\nkept seeing his brother's mocking face.\n\nHe summoned Fulks.\n\nThe gnome looked up at him expectantly. \"Get me a jetcopter,\" Walton\nordered. \"I'll be waiting on the west stage for it.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\nFulks never had any problems, Walton reflected sourly. The little man\nhad found his niche in life; he spent his days in the plush comfort of\nthe Bronze Room, seeing to the wants of the members. Never any choices\nto make, never any of the agonizing decisions that complicated life.\n\nDecisions. Walton realized that one particular decision had been made\nfor him, that of seeking the directorship permanently. He had not been\nplanning to do that. Now he had no choice but to remain in office as\nlong as he could.\n\nHe stepped out onto the landing stage and into the waiting jetcopter.\n\"Cullen Building,\" he told the robopilot abstractedly.\n\nHe did not feel very cheerful.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe annunciator panel in Walton's office was bright as a Christmas\ntree; the signal bulbs were all alight, each representing someone\nanxious to speak to him. He flipped over the circuit-breaker,\nindicating he was back in his office, and received the first call.\n\nIt was from Lee Percy. Percy's thick features were wrinkled into a\nsmile. \"Just heard that speech you made outside the building this\nmorning, Roy. It's getting a big blare on the newsscreens. Beautiful!\nSimply beautiful! Couldn't have been better if we'd concocted it\nourselves.\"\n\n\"Glad you like it,\" Walton said. \"It really was off the cuff.\"\n\n\"Even better, then. You're positively a genius. Say, I wanted to tell\nyou that we've got the FitzMaugham memorial all whipped up and ready to\ngo. Full channel blast tonight over all media at 2000 sharp ... a solid\nhour block. Nifty. Neat.\"\n\n\"Is my speech in the program?\"\n\n\"Sure is, Roy. A slick one, too. Makes two speeches of yours blasted in\na single day.\"\n\n\"Send me a transcript of my speech before it goes on the air,\" Walton\nsaid. \"I want to read and approve that thing if it's supposed to be\ncoming out of my mouth.\"\n\n\"It's a natural, Roy. You don't have to worry.\"\n\n\"_I want to read it beforehand!_\" Walton snapped.\n\n\"Okay, okay. Don't chew my ears off. I'll ship it to you posthaste,\nman. Ease up. Pop a pill. You aren't loose, Roy.\"\n\n\"I can't afford to be,\" Walton said.\n\nHe broke contact and almost instantly the next call blossomed on the\nscreen. Walton recognized the man as one of the technicians from\ncommunications, floor twenty-three.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"We heard from McLeod again, sir. Message came in half an hour ago and\nwe've been trying to reach you ever since.\"\n\n\"I wasn't in. Give me the message.\"\n\nThe technician unfolded a slip of paper. \"It says, 'Arriving Nairobi\ntonight, will be in New York by morning. McLeod.'\"\n\n\"Good. Send him confirmation and tell him I'll keep the entire morning\nfree to see him.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh--anything from Venus?\"\n\nThe technician shook his head emphatically. \"Not a peep. We can't make\ncontact with Dr. Lang at all.\"\n\nWalton frowned. He wondered what was happening to the terraforming\ncrew up there. \"Keep trying, will you? Work a twenty-four-hour-a-day\nschedule. Draw extra pay. But get in touch with Lang, dammit!\"\n\n\"Y-yes, sir. Anything else?\"\n\n\"No. Get off the line.\"\n\nAs the contact snapped Walton smoothly broke connection again, leaving\nten more would-be callers sputtering. A row of lights a foot long\nindicated their presence on the line. Walton ignored them and turned\ninstead to his newsscreen.\n\nThe 1400 news was on. He fiddled with the controls and saw his own face\ntake form on the screen. He was standing outside the Cullen Building,\nlooking right out of the screen at himself, and in the background could\nbe seen a huddled form under a coat. The dead Herschelite.\n\nWalton of the screen was saying, \"... The man was asking for trouble.\nPopeek represents the minds and hearts of the world. Herschel and his\npeople seek to overthrow this order. I can't condone violence of any\nsort, naturally, but Popeek is a sacred responsibility to me. Its\nenemies I must regard as blind and misguided people.\"\n\nHe was smiling into the camera, but there was something behind the\nsmile, something cold and steely, that astonished the watching Walton.\n_My God_, he thought. _Is that genuine? Have I really grown so hard?_\n\nApparently he had. He watched himself turn majestically and stride\ninto the Cullen Building, stronghold of Popeek. There was definitely a\ncommanding air about him.\n\nThe commentator was saying, \"With those heartfelt words, Director\nWalton goes to his desk in the Cullen Building to carry out his weighty\ntask. To bring life out of death, joy out of sadness--this is the\njob facing Popeek, and this is the sort of man to whom it has been\nentrusted. Roy Walton, we salute you!\"\n\nThe screen panned to a still of Director FitzMaugham. \"Meanwhile,\" the\ncommentator went on, \"Walton's predecessor, the late D. F. FitzMaugham,\nwent to his rest today. Police are still hoping to uncover the group\nresponsible for his brutal slaying, and report a good probability of\nsuccess. Tonight all channels will carry a memorial program for this\ngreat leader of humanity. D. F. FitzMaugham, hail and farewell!\"\n\nA little sickened, Walton snapped the set off. He had to admire Lee\nPercy; the propaganda man had done his job well. With a minor assist\nfrom Walton by way of a spontaneous speech, Percy had contrived to gain\nvast quantities of precious air time for Popeek. All to the good.\n\nThe annunciator was still blinking violently; it seemed about to\nexplode with the weight of pent-up, frustrated calls. Walton nudged a\nred stud at the top and Security Chief Sellors entered the screen.\n\n\"Sellors, sir. We've been looking for this Lamarre. Can't find him\nanywhere.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"We checked him to his home. He got there, all right. Then he\ndisappeared. No sign of him anywhere in the city. What now, sir?\"\n\nWalton felt his fingers quivering. \"Order a tracer sent out through\nall of Appalachia. No, cancel that--make it country-wide. Beam his\ndescription everywhere. Got any snaps?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Get them on the air. Tell the country this man is vital to global\nsecurity. Find him, Sellors.\"\n\n\"We'll give it a try.\"\n\n\"Better than that. You'll _find_ him. If he doesn't turn up within\neight hours, shift the tracer to world-wide. He might be anywhere--and\nhe has to be found!\"\n\nWalton blanked the screen and avoided the next caller. He called his\nsecretary and said, \"Will you instruct everyone now calling me to refer\ntheir business downstairs to Assistant Administrator Eglin. If they\ndon't want to do that, tell them to put it in writing and send it to\nme. I can't accept any more calls just now.\" Then he added, \"Oh, put me\nthrough to Eglin myself before you let any of those calls reach him.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEglin's face appeared on the private screen that linked the two\noffices. The small man looked dark-browed and harried. \"This is a hell\nof a job, Roy,\" he sighed.\n\n\"So is mine,\" Walton said. \"Look, I've got a ton of calls on the wire,\nand I'm transferring them all down to you. Throw as many as you can\ndown to the subordinates. It's the only way to keep your sanity.\"\n\n\"Thanks. Thanks loads, Roy. All I need now is some more calls.\"\n\n\"Can't be helped. Who'd you pick for your replacement as director of\nfield agents?\" Walton asked.\n\n\"Lassen. I sent his dossier to you hours ago.\"\n\n\"Haven't read it yet. Is he on the job already?\"\n\n\"Sure. He's been there since I moved up here,\" Eglin said. \"What--\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" said Walton. He hung up and called Lassen, the new\ndirector of field agents.\n\nLassen was a boyish-looking young man with stiff sandy hair and a\nsternly efficient manner. Walton said, \"Lassen, I want you to do a job\nfor me. Get one of your men to make up a list of the hundred biggest\nprivate estates still unequalized. I want the names of their owners,\nlocation of the estates, acreage, and things like that. Got it?\"\n\n\"Right. When will you want it, Mr. Walton?\"\n\n\"Immediately. But I don't want it to be a sloppy job. This is top\nimportant, double.\"\n\nLassen nodded. Walton grinned at him--the boy seemed to be in good\ncontrol of himself--and clicked off.\n\nHe realized that he'd been engaged in half a dozen high-power\nconversations without a break, over a span of perhaps twenty minutes.\nHis heart was pounding; his feet felt numb.\n\nHe popped a benzolurethrin into his mouth and kept on going. He\nwould need to act fast, now that the wheels were turning. McLeod\narriving the next day to report the results of the faster-than-light\nexpedition, Lamarre missing, Fred at large and working for a conspiracy\nof landowners--Walton foresaw that he would be on a steady diet of\ntranquilizers for the next few days.\n\nHe opened the arrival bin and pulled out a handful of paper. One thick\nbundle was the dossier on Lassen; Walton initialed it and tossed\nit unread into the Files chute. He would have to rely on Eglin's\njudgement; Lassen seemed competent enough.\n\nUnderneath that, he found the script of the FitzMaugham memorial\nprogram to be shown that evening. Walton sat back and started to skim\nthrough it.\n\nIt was the usual sort of eulogy. He skipped rapidly past FitzMaugham's\nlife and great works, on to the part where Interim Director Walton\nappeared on the screen to speak.\n\nThis part he read more carefully. He was very much interested in the\nwords that Percy had placed in his mouth.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nThe speech that night went over well ... almost.\n\nWalton watched the program in the privacy of his home, sprawled out\non the foamweb sofa with a drink in one hand and the text of Percy's\nshooting-script in the other. The giant screen that occupied nearly\nhalf of his one unbroken wall glowed in lifelike colors.\n\nFitzMaugham's career was traced with pomp and circumstance, done\nup in full glory: plenty of ringing trumpet flourishes, dozens of\neye-appealing color groupings, much high-pitched, tense narrative.\nPercy had done his job skillfully. The show was punctuated by\nquotations from FitzMaugham's classic book, _Breathing Space and\nSanity_. Key government figures drifted in and out of the narrative\nwebwork, orating sonorously. That pious fraud, M. Seymour Lanson,\nPresident of the United States, delivered a flowery speech; the old\nfigurehead was an artist at his one function, speechmaking. Walton\nwatched, spellbound. Lee Percy was a genius in his field; there was no\ndenying that.\n\nFinally, toward the end of the hour, the narrator said, \"The work\nof Popeek goes on, though its lofty-minded creator lies dead at an\nassassin's hand. Director FitzMaugham had chosen as his successor a\nyoung man schooled in the ideals of Popeek. Roy Walton, we know, will\ncontinue the noble task begun by D. F. FitzMaugham.\"\n\nFor the second time that day Walton watched his own face appear on\na video screen. He glanced down at the script in his hand and back\nup at the screen. Percy's technicians had done a brilliant job. The\nWalton-image on the screen looked so real that the Walton on the couch\nalmost believed he had actually delivered this speech--although he\nknew it had been cooked up out of some rearranged stills and a few\nbrokendown phonemes with his voice characteristics.\n\nIt was a perfectly innocent speech. In humble tones he expressed his\nveneration for the late director, his hopes that he would be able to\nfill the void left by the death of FitzMaugham, his sense of Popeek as\na sacred trust. Half-listening, Walton began to skim the script.\n\nStartled, Walton looked down at the script. He didn't remember having\nencountered any such lines on his first reading, and he couldn't find\nthem now. \"This morning,\" the pseudo-Walton on the screen went on, \"we\nreceived _contact from outer space_! From a faster-than-light ship\nsent out over a year ago to explore our neighboring stars.\n\n\"News of this voyage has been withheld until now for security reasons.\nBut it is my great pleasure to tell you tonight that the stars have at\nlast been reached by man.... A new world waits for us out there, lush,\nfertile, ready to be colonized by the brave pioneers of tomorrow!\"\n\nWalton stared aghast at the screen. His simulacrum had returned now to\nthe script as prepared, but he barely listened.\n\nHe was thinking that Percy had let the cat out for sure. It was a\ntotally unauthorized newsbreak. Numbly, Walton watched the program\ncome to its end, and wondered what the repercussions would be once the\npublic grasped all the implications.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was awakened at 0600 by the chiming of his phone. Grumpily he\nclimbed from bed, snapped on the receiver, switched the cutoff on the\npicture sender in order to hide his sleep-rumpled appearance, and said,\n\"This is Walton. Yes?\"\n\nA picture formed on the screen: a heavily-tanned man in his late\nforties, stocky, hair close cropped. \"Sorry to roust you this way, old\nman. I'm McLeod.\"\n\nWalton came fully awake in an instant. \"McLeod? Where are you?\"\n\n\"Out on Long Island. I just pulled into the airport half a moment ago.\nTraveled all night after dumping the ship at Nairobi.\"\n\n\"You made a good landing, I hope?\"\n\n\"The best. The ship navigates like a bubble.\" McLeod frowned worriedly.\n\"They brought me the early-morning telefax while I was having\nbreakfast. I couldn't help reading all about the speech you made last\nnight.\"\n\n\"Oh. I--\"\n\n\"Quite a crasher of a speech,\" McLeod went on evenly. \"But don't you\nthink it was a little premature of you to release word of my flight. I\nmean--\"\n\n\"It was quite premature,\" Walton said. \"A member of my staff inserted\nthat statement into my talk without my knowledge. He'll be disciplined\nfor it.\"\n\nA puzzled frown appeared on McLeod's face. \"But _you_ made that speech\nwith your own lips! How can you blame it on a member of your staff?\"\n\n\"The science that can send a ship to Procyon and back within a year,\"\nWalton said, \"can also fake a speech. But I imagine we'll be able to\ncover up the pre-release without too much trouble.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure of that,\" said McLeod. He shrugged apologetically.\n\"You see, that planet's there, all right. But it happens to be the\nproperty of alien beings who live in the next world. And they're not so\nhappy about having Earth come crashing into their system to colonize!\"\n\nSomehow Walton managed to hang onto his self-control, even with this\nstaggering news crashing about him. \"You've been in contact with these\nbeings?\" he asked.\n\nMcLeod nodded. \"They have a translating gadget. We met them, yes.\"\n\nWalton moistened his lips. \"I think there's going to be trouble,\" he\nsaid. \"I think I may be out of a job, too.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"Just thinking out loud,\" Walton said. \"Finish your breakfast and meet\nme at my office at 0900. We'll talk this thing out then.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWalton was in full command of himself by the time he reached the Cullen\nBuilding.\n\nHe had read the morning telefax and heard the newsblares: they all\nscreamed the sum and essence of Walton's speech of the previous night,\nand a few of the braver telefax outfits went as far as printing a\nresum\u00e9 of the entire speech, boiled down to Basic, of course, for\nbenefit of that substantial segment of the reading public that was\nmost comfortable while moving its lips. The one telefax outfit most\noutspokenly opposed to Popeek, _Citizen_, took great delight in giving\nthe speech full play, and editorializing on a subsequent sheet against\nthe \"veil of security\" hazing Popeek operations.\n\nWalton read the _Citizen_ editorial twice, savoring its painstaking\nsimplicities of expression. Then he clipped it out neatly and shot it\ndown the chute to public relations, marked _Attention: Lee Percy_.\n\n\"There's a Mr. McLeod waiting to see you,\" his secretary informed him.\n\"He says he has an appointment.\"\n\n\"Send him in,\" Walton said. \"And have Mr. Percy come up here also.\"\n\nWhile he waited for McLeod to arrive, Walton riffled through the\nrest of the telefax sheets. Some of them praised Popeek for having\nuncovered a new world; others damned them for having hidden news of the\nfaster-than-light drive so long. Walton stacked them neatly in a heap\nat the edge of his desk.\n\nIn the bleak, dark hours of the morning, he had expected to be\ncompelled to resign. Now, he realized, he could immeasurably strengthen\nhis own position if he could control the flow of events and channel\nthem properly.\n\nThe square figure of McLeod appeared on the screen. Walton admitted him.\n\n\"Sir. I'm McLeod.\"\n\n\"Of course. Won't you sit down?\"\n\nMcLeod was tense, stiffly formal, very British in his reserve and\ngeneral bearing. Walton gestured uneasily, trying to cut through the\ncrackle of nervousness.\n\n\"We seem to have a mess on our hands,\" he said. \"But there's no mess so\nmessy we can't muddle through it, eh?\"\n\n\"If we have to, sir. But I can't help feeling this could all have been\navoided.\"\n\n\"No. You're wrong, McLeod. If it _could_ have been avoided, it would\nhave been avoided. The fact that some idiot in my public relations\ndepartment gained access to my wire and found out you were returning is\nincontrovertible; it happened, despite precautions.\"\n\n\"Mr. Percy to see you,\" the annunciator said.\n\nThe angular figure of Lee Percy appeared on the screen. Walton told him\nto come in.\n\nPercy looked frightened--terrified, Walton thought. He held a folded\nslip of paper loosely in one hand.\n\n\"Good morning, sir.\"\n\n\"Good morning, Lee.\" Walton observed that the friendly _Roy_ had\nchanged to the formal salutation, _sir_. \"Did you get the clipping I\nsent you?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" Glumly.\n\n\"Lee, this is Leslie McLeod, chief of operations of our successful\nfaster-than-light project. Colonel McLeod, I want you to meet Lee\nPercy. He's the man who masterminded our little newsbreak last night.\"\n\nPercy flinched visibly. He stepped forward and laid his slip of paper\non Walton's desk. \"I m-made a m-mistake last night,\" he stammered. \"I\nshould never have released that break.\"\n\n\"Damned right you shouldn't have,\" Walton agreed, carefully keeping\nany hint of severity from his voice. \"You have us in considerable\nhot water, Lee. That planet isn't ours for colonization, despite the\nenthusiasm with which I allegedly announced it last night. And you\nought to be clever enough to realize it's impossible to withdraw and\ndeny good news once you've broken it.\"\n\n\"The planet's not ours? But--?\"\n\n\"According to Colonel McLeod,\" Walton said, \"the planet is the property\nof intelligent alien beings who live on a neighboring world, and who\nno more care to have their system overrun by a pack of Earthmen than we\nwould to have extrasolar aliens settle on Mars.\"\n\n\"Sir, that sheet of paper ...\" Percy said in a choked voice.\n\"It's--it's--\"\n\nWalton unfolded it. It was Percy's resignation. He read the note\ncarefully twice, smiled, and laid it down. Now was his time to be\nmagnanimous.\n\n\"Denied,\" he said. \"We need you on our team, Lee. I'm authorizing a ten\npercent pay-cut for one week, effective yesterday, but there'll be no\nother penalty.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\n\n_He's crawling to me_, Walton thought in amazement. He said, \"Only\ndon't pull that stunt again, or I'll not only fire you but blacklist\nyou so hard you won't be able to find work between here and Procyon.\nUnderstand?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Okay. Go back to your office and get to work. And no more publicity\non this faster-than-light thing until I authorize it. No--cancel that.\nGet out a quick release, a followup on last night. A smoke screen, I\nmean. Cook up so much cloudy verbiage about the conquest of space that\nno one bothers to remember anything of what I said. And play down the\ncolonization angle!\"\n\n\"I get it, sir.\" Percy grinned feebly.\n\n\"I doubt that,\" Walton snapped. \"When you have the release prepared,\nshoot it up here for my okay. And heaven help you if you deviate from\nthe text I see by as much as a single comma!\"\n\nPercy practically backed out of the office.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Why did you do that?\" McLeod asked, puzzled.\n\n\"You mean, why did I let him off so lightly?\"\n\nMcLeod nodded. \"In the military,\" he said, \"we'd have a man shot for\ndoing a thing like that.\"\n\n\"This isn't the military,\" Walton said. \"And even though the man\nbehaved like a congenital idiot yesterday, that's not enough evidence\nto push him into Happysleep. Besides, he knows his stuff. I can't\nafford to discharge him.\"\n\n\"Are public relations men that hard to come by?\"\n\n\"No. But he's a good one--and the prospect of having him desert to the\nother side frightens me. He'll be forever grateful to me now. If I had\nfired him, he would've had half a dozen anti-Popeek articles in the\n_Citizen_ before the week was out. And they'd ruin us.\"\n\nMcLeod smiled appreciatively. \"You handle your job well, Mr. Walton.\"\n\n\"I have to,\" Walton said. \"The director of Popeek is paid to produce\ntwo or three miracles per hour. One gets used to it, after a while.\nTell me about these aliens, Colonel McLeod.\"\n\nMcLeod swung a briefcase to Walton's desk and flipped the magneseal. He\nhanded Walton a thick sheaf of glossy color photos.\n\n\"The first dozen or so are scenes of the planet,\" McLeod explained.\n\"It's Procyon VIII--number eight out of sixteen, unless we missed a\ncouple. We checked sixteen worlds in the system, anyway. Ten of 'em\nwere methane giants; we didn't even bother to land. Two were ammonia\nsupergiants, even less pleasant. Three small ones had no atmosphere\nat all worth speaking about, and were no more livable looking than\nMercury. And the remaining one was the one we call New Earth. Take a\nlook, sir.\"\n\nWalton looked. The photos showed rolling hills covered with\nclose-packed shrubbery, flowing rivers, a lovely sunrise. Several of\nthe shots were of indigenous life--a wizened little four-handed monkey,\na six-legged doglike thing, a toothy bird.\n\n\"Life runs to six limbs there,\" Walton observed. \"But how livable can\nthis place be? Unless your photos are sour, that grass is _blue_ ...\nand the water's peculiar looking, too. What sort of tests did you run?\"\n\n\"It's the light, sir. Procyon's a double star; that faint companion\ngets up in the sky and does tricky things to the camera. That grass may\nlook blue, but it's a chlorophyll-based photosynthesizer all the same.\nAnd the water's nothing but H_{2}O, even with that purple tinge.\"\n\nWalton nodded. \"How about the atmosphere?\"\n\n\"We were breathing it for a week, and no trouble. It's pretty rich in\noxygen--twenty-four percent. Gives you a bouncy feeling--just right for\npioneers, I'd say.\"\n\n\"You've prepared a full report on this place, haven't you?\"\n\n\"Of course. It's right here.\" McLeod started to reach for his briefcase.\n\n\"Not just yet,\" Walton said. \"I want to go through the rest of these\nsnapshots.\" He turned over one after another rapidly until he came to\na photo that showed a strange blocky figure, four-armed, bright green\nin color. Its neckless head was encased in a sort of breathing mask\nfashioned from some transparent plastic. Three cold, brooding eyes\npeered outward.\n\n\"What's this?\" Walton asked.\n\n\"Oh, that.\" McLeod attempted a cheerful grin. \"That's a Dirnan. They\nlive on Procyon IX, one of the ammonia-giant planets. They're the\naliens who don't want us there.\"\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nWalton stared at the photograph of the alien. There was intelligence\nthere ... yes, intelligence and understanding, and perhaps even a sort\nof compassion.\n\nHe sighed. There were always qualifications, never unalloyed successes.\n\n\"Colonel McLeod, how long would it take your ship to return to the\nProcyon system?\" he asked thoughtfully.\n\nMcLeod considered the question. \"Hardly any time, sir. A few days,\nmaybe. Why?\"\n\n\"Just a wild idea. Tell me about your contact with these--ah--Dirnans.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, they landed after we'd spent more than a week surveying New\nEarth. There were six of them, and they had their translating widget\nwith them. They told us who they were, and wanted to know who we were.\nWe told them. They said they ran the Procyon system, and weren't of a\nmind to let any alien beings come barging in.\"\n\n\"Did they sound hostile?\" Walton asked.\n\n\"Oh, no. Just businesslike. We were trespassing, and they asked us to\nget off. They were cold about it, but not angry.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Walton said. \"Look here, now. Do you think you could go back\nto their world as--well as an ambassador from Earth? Bring one of the\nDirnans here for treaty talks, and such?\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" McLeod said hesitantly. \"If it's necessary.\"\n\n\"It looks as if it may be. You had no luck in any of the other nearby\nsystems?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then Procyon VIII's our main hope. Tell your men we'll offer double\npay for this cruise. And make it as fast as you know how.\"\n\n\"Hyperspace travel's practically instantaneous,\" McLeod said. \"We spent\nmost of our time cruising on standard ion drive from planet to planet.\nManeuvering in the subspace manifold's a snap, though.\"\n\n\"Good. Snap it up, then. Back to Nairobi and clear out of there as\nsoon as you're ready. Remember, it's urgent you bring one of the aliens\nhere for treaty talks.\"\n\n\"I'll do my best,\" McLeod said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWalton stared at the empty seat where McLeod had been, and tried to\npicture a green Dirnan sitting there, goggling at him with its three\neyes.\n\nHe was beginning to feel like a juggler. Popeek activity proceeded on\nso many fronts at once that it quite dazzled him. And every hour there\nwere new challenges to meet, new decisions to make.\n\nAt the moment, there were too many eggs and not enough baskets. Walton\nrealized he was making the same mistake FitzMaugham had, that of\ncarrying too much of the Popeek workings inside his skull. If anything\nhappened to him, the operation would be fatally paralyzed, and it would\nbe some time before the gears were meshing again.\n\nHe resolved to keep a journal, to record each day a full and\nmercilessly honest account of each of the many maneuvers in which he\nwas engaged. He would begin with his private conflict with Fred and the\ninterests Fred represented, follow through with the Lamarre-immortality\nepisode, and include a detailed report on the problems of the\nsubsidiary projects, New Earth and Lang's terraforming group.\n\nThat gave him another idea. Reaching for his voicewrite, he dictated\na concise confidential memorandum instructing Assistant Administrator\nEglin to outfit an investigatory mission immediately; purpose, to go\nto Venus and make contact with Lang. The terraforming group was nearly\ntwo weeks overdue in its scheduled report. He could not ignore them any\nlonger.\n\nThe everlasting annunciator chimed, and Walton switched on the screen.\nIt was Sellors, and from the look of abject terror on the man's face,\nWalton knew that something sticky had just transpired.\n\n\"What is it, Sellors? Any luck in tracing Lamarre?\"\n\n\"None, sir,\" the security chief said. \"But there's been another\ndevelopment, Mr. Walton. A most serious one. _Most_ serious.\"\n\nWalton was ready to expect anything--a bulletin announcing the end of\nthe universe, perhaps. \"Well, tell me about it,\" he snapped impatiently.\n\nSellors seemed about ready to collapse with shame. He said hesitantly,\n\"One of the communications technicians was making a routine check of\nthe building's circuits, Mr. Walton. He found one trunk-line that\ndidn't seem to belong where it was, so he checked up and found out that\nit had been newly installed.\"\n\n\"Well, what of it?\"\n\n\"It was a spy pickup with its outlet in your office, sir,\" Sellors\nsaid, letting the words tumble out in one blur. \"All the time you were\ntalking this morning, someone was spying on you.\"\n\nWalton grabbed the arms of his chair. \"Are you telling me that your\ndepartment was blind enough to let someone pipe a spy pickup right into\nthis office?\" he demanded. \"Where did this outlet go? And is it cut\noff?\"\n\n\"They cut it off as soon as they found it, sir. It went to a men's\nlavatory on the twenty-sixth floor.\"\n\n\"And how long was it in operation?\"\n\n\"At least since last night, sir. Communications assures me that it\ncouldn't possibly have been there before yesterday afternoon, since\nthey ran a general check then and didn't see it.\"\n\nWalton groaned. It was small comfort to know that he had had privacy\nup till last evening; if the wrong people had listened in on his\nconversation with McLeod, there would be serious trouble.\n\n\"All right, Sellors. This thing can't be your fault, but keep your eyes\npeeled in the future. And tell communications that my office is to be\nchecked for such things twice a day from now on, at 0900 and at 1300.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" Sellors looked tremendously relieved.\n\n\"And start interrogating the communications technicians. Find out who's\nresponsible for that spy circuit, and hold him on security charges. And\nlocate Lamarre!\"\n\n\"I'll do my best, Mr. Walton.\"\n\nWhile the screen was clearing, Walton jotted down a memorandum to\nhimself: _investigate Sellors_. So far, as security chief, Sellors had\nallowed an assassin to reach FitzMaugham, allowed Prior to burst into\nWalton's old office, permitted Fred to masquerade as a doorsmith long\nenough to gain access to Walton's private files, and stood by blindly\nwhile Lee Percy tapped into Walton's private wire and some unidentified\ntechnician strung a spy pickup into the director's supposedly sacred\noffice.\n\nNo security chief could have been as incompetent as all that. It had to\nbe a planned campaign, directed from the outside.\n\nHe dialed Eglin.\n\n\"Olaf, you get my message about the Venus rescue mission okay?\"\n\n\"Came through a few minutes ago. I'll have the specs drawn up by\ntonight.\"\n\n\"Devil with that,\" Walton said. \"Drop everything and send that ship out\n_now_. I've got to know what Lang and his crew are up to, and I have\nto know right away. If we don't produce a livable Venus, or at least\nthe possibility of one, in a couple of days, we'll be in for it on all\nsides.\"\n\n\"Why? What's up?\"\n\n\"You'll see. Keep an eye on the telefax. I'll bet the next edition of\n_Citizen_ is going to be interesting.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was.\n\nThe glossy sheets of the 1200 _Citizen_ extruded themselves from a\nmillion receivers in the New York area, but none of those million\ncopies was as avidly pounced on as was Director Walton's. He had been\nhovering near the wall outlet for ten minutes, avidly awaiting the\nsheet's arrival.\n\nAnd he was not disappointed.\n\nThe streamer headline ran:\n\n    _THINGS FROM SPACE NIX BIG POPEEK PLAN_\n\nAnd under it in smaller type:\n\n    _Greenskinned Uglies Put Feet In Director Walton's Big Mouth_\n\nHe smiled grimly and went on to the story itself. Written in the best\napproved _Citizen_ journalese, it read:\n\n    _Fellow human beings, we've been suckered again. The_ Citizen _found\n    out for sure this morning that the big surprise Popeek's Interim\n    Director Walton yanked out of his hat last night has a hole in it._\n\n    _It's sure dope that there's a good planet up there in the sky for\n    grabs. The way we hear it, it's just like earth only prettier, with\n    trees and flowers (remember them?). Our man says the air there is\n    nice and clean. This world sounds okay._\n\n    _But what Walton didn't know last night came home to roost today.\n    Seems the folks on the next planet out there don't want any sloppy\n    old Earthmen messing up their pasture--and so we ain't going to have\n    any New Earth after all. Wish-washy Walton is a cinch to throw in\n    the towel now._\n\n    _More dope in later editions. And check the edit page for extra\n    info._\n\nIt was obvious, Walton thought, that the spy pickup which had been\nplanted in his office had been a direct pipe line to the _Citizen_ news\ndesk. They had taken his conversation with McLeod and carefully ground\nit down into the chatty, informal, colloquial style that made _Citizen_\nthe world's most heavily-subscribed telefax service.\n\nHe shuddered at what might have happened if they'd had their spy\npickup installed a day earlier, and overheard Walton in the process of\nsuppressing Lamarre's immortality serum. There would have been a lynch\nmob storming the Cullen Building ten minutes after the _Citizen_ hit\nthe waves with its expos\u00e9.\n\nNot that he was much better off now. He no longer had the advantage of\nsecrecy to cloak his actions, and public officials who were compelled\nto conduct business in the harsh light of public scrutiny generally\ndidn't hold their offices for long.\n\nHe turned the sheet over and searched for the editorial column, merely\nto confirm his expectations.\n\nIt was captioned in bold black:\n\n    _ARE WE PATSIES FOR GREENSKINS?_\n\nAnd went on to say:\n\n    _Non-human beings have said \"Whoa!\" to our plans for opening up a\n    new world in space. These aliens have put thumbs down on\n    colonization of the New Earth discovered by Colonel Leslie McLeod._\n\n    _Aside from the question of why Popeek kept word of the McLeod\n    expedition from the public so long, there is this to consider--will\n    we take this lying down?_\n\n    _We've got to find space for us to live. New Earth is a good place.\n    The answer to the trouble is easy: we take New Earth. If the\n    greenskins don't like it, bounce 'em!_\n\n    _How about it? What do we do? Mr. Walton, we want to know. What\n    goes?_\n\nIt was an open exhortation to interstellar warfare. Dispiritedly,\nWalton let the telefax sheets skitter to the floor, and made no move to\npick them up.\n\nWar with the Dirnans? If _Citizen_ had its way, there would be. The\ntelefax sheet would remorselessly stir the people up until the cry for\nwar was unanimous.\n\n_Well_, thought Walton callously, _a good war would reduce the\npopulation surplus. The idiots!_\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe caught the afternoon newsblares. They were full of the _Citizen_\nbreak, and one commentator made a point-blank demand that Walton either\nadvocate war with the Dirnans or resign.\n\nNot long afterward, UN delegate Ludwig called.\n\n\"Some hot action over here today,\" he told Walton. \"After that\n_Citizen_ thing got out, a few of the Oriental delegates started\nhowling for your scalp on sixteen different counts of bungling. What's\ngoing on, Walton?\"\n\n\"Plenty of spy activity, for one thing. The main problem, though, is\nthe nucleus of incompetent assistants surrounding me. I think I'm going\nto reduce the local population personally before the day is out. With a\nblunt instrument, preferably.\"\n\n\"Is there any truth in the _Citizen_ story?\"\n\n\"Hell, yes!\" Walton exclaimed. \"For once, it's gospel! An enterprising\ntelefax man rigged a private pipe line into my office last night and\nno one caught it until it was too late. Sure, those aliens are holding\nout. They don't want us coming in there.\"\n\nLudwig chewed at his lip. \"You have any plans?\"\n\n\"Dozens of them. Want some, cheap?\" He laughed, a brittle, unamused\nlaugh.\n\n\"Seriously, Roy. You ought to go on the air again and smooth this thing\nover. The people are yelling for war with these Dirnans, and half of\nus over here at the UN aren't even sure the damned creatures exist.\nCouldn't you fake it up a little?\"\n\n\"No,\" Walton said. \"There's been enough faking. I'm going on the air\nwith the truth for a change! Better have all your delegates over there\nlistening in, because their ears are in for an opening.\"\n\nAs soon as he was rid of Ludwig he called Lee Percy.\n\n\"That program on the conquest of space is almost ready to go,\" the\npublic relations man informed him.\n\n\"Kill it. Have you seen the noon _Citizen_?\"\n\n\"No; been too busy on the new program. Anything big?\"\n\nWalton chuckled. \"Fairly big. The _Citizen_ just yanked the rug out\nfrom under everything. We'll probably be at war with Procyon IX by\nsundown. I want you to buy me air space on every medium for the 1900\nspot tonight.\"\n\n\"Sure thing. What kind of speech you want us to cook up?\"\n\n\"None at all,\" Walton said. \"I'm going to speak off the cuff for a\nchange. Just buy the time for me, and squeeze the budget for all it's\nworth.\"\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\n\nThe bright light of the video cameras flooded the room. Percy had\ndone a good job; there was a representative from every network, every\ntelefax, every blare of any sort at all. The media had been corralled.\nWalton's words would echo round the world.\n\nHe was seated behind his desk--seated, because he could shape his words\nmore forcefully that way, and also because he was terribly tired. He\nsmiled into the battery of cameras.\n\n\"Good evening,\" he said. \"I'm Roy Walton, speaking to you from the\noffices of the Bureau of Population Equalization. I've been director\nof Popeek for a little less than a week, now, and I'd like to make a\nreport--a progress report, so to speak.\n\n\"We of Popeek regard ourselves as holding a mandate from you, the\npeople. After all, it was the world-wide referendum last year that\nenabled the United Nations to put us into business. And I want to tell\nyou how the work of Popeek is going.\n\n\"Our aim is to provide breathing space for human beings. The world is\nvastly overcrowded, with its seven billion people. Popeek's job is to\nease that overcrowdedness, to equalize the population masses of the\nworld so that the empty portions of the globe are filled up and the\nextremely overcrowded places thinned out a little. But this is only\npart of our job--the short-range, temporary part. We're planning for\nthe future here. We know we can't keep shifting population from place\nto place on Earth; it won't work forever. Eventually every square inch\nis going to be covered, and then where do we go?\n\n\"You know the answer. We go _out_. We reach for the stars. At present\nwe have spaceships that can take us to the planets, but the planets\naren't suitable for human life. All right, we'll _make_ them suitable!\nAt this very moment a team of engineers is on Venus, in that hot, dry,\nformaldehyde atmosphere, struggling to turn Venus into a world fit for\noxygen-breathing human beings. They'll do it, too--and when they're\ndone with Venus they'll move on to Mars, to the Moon, perhaps to the\nbig satellites of Jupiter and Saturn too. There'll be a day when the\nsolar system will be habitable from Mercury to Pluto--we hope.\"\n\n\"But even that is short-range,\" Walton said pointedly. \"There'll be\na day--it may be a hundred years from now, or a thousand, or ten\nthousand--when the entire solar system will be as crowded with humanity\nas Earth is today. We have to plan for that day, too. It's the _lack_\nof planning on the part of our ancestors that's made things so hard for\nus. We of Popeek don't want to repeat the tragic mistakes of the past.\n\n\"My predecessor, the late Director FitzMaugham, was aware of this\nproblem. He succeeded in gathering a group of scientists and\ntechnicians who developed a super space drive, a faster-than-light ship\nthat can travel to the stars virtually instantaneously, instead of\ntaking years to make the trip as our present ships would.\n\n\"The ship was built and sent out on an exploratory mission. Director\nFitzMaugham chose to keep this fact a secret. He was afraid of arousing\nfalse hopes in case the expedition should be a failure.\n\n\"The expedition was _not_ a failure! Colonel Leslie McLeod and his men\ndiscovered a planet similar to Earth in the system of the star Procyon.\nI have seen photographs of New Earth, as they have named it, and I can\ntell you that it is a lovely planet ... and one that will be receptive\nto our pioneers.\"\n\nWalton paused a moment before launching into the main subject of his\ntalk.\n\n\"Unfortunately, there is a race of intelligent beings living on a\nneighboring planet of this world. Perhaps you have seen the misleading\nand inaccurate reports blared today to the effect that these people\nrefuse to allow Earth to colonize in their system. Some of you have\ncried out for immediate war against these people, the Dirnans.\n\n\"I must confirm part of the story the telefax carried today: the\nDirnans are definitely not anxious to have Earth set up a colony on a\nworld adjoining theirs. We are strangers to them, and their reaction is\nunderstandable. After all, suppose a race of strange-looking creatures\nlanded on Mars, and proceeded with wholesale colonization of our\nneighboring world? We'd be uneasy, to say the least.\n\n\"And so the Dirnans are uneasy. However, I've summoned a Dirnan\nambassador--our first diplomatic contact with intelligent alien\ncreatures!--and I hope he'll be on Earth shortly. I plan to convince\nhim that we're peaceful, neighborly people, and that it will be to our\nmutual benefit to allow Earth colonization in the Procyon system.\n\n\"I'm going to need your help. If, while our alien guest is here, he\ndiscovers that some misguided Earthmen are demanding war with Dirna,\nhe's certainly not going to think of us as particularly desirable\nneighbors to welcome with open arms. I want to stress the importance of\nthis. Sure, we can go to war with Dirna for possession of Procyon VIII.\nBut why spread wholesale destruction on two worlds when we can probably\nachieve our goal peacefully?\n\n\"That's all I have to say tonight, people of the world. I hope you'll\nthink about what I've told you. Popeek works twenty-four hours a day\nin your behalf, but we need your full cooperation if we're going to\nachieve our aims and bring humanity to its full maturity. Thank you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe floodlights winked out suddenly, leaving Walton momentarily\nblinded. When he opened his eyes again he saw the cameramen moving\ntheir bulky apparatus out of the office quickly and efficiently. The\nregular programs had returned to the channels--the vapid dancing and\njoke-making, the terror shows, the kaleidowhirls.\n\nNow that it was over, now that the tension was broken, Walton\nexperienced a moment of bitter disillusionment. He had had high hopes\nfor his speech, but had he really put it over? He wasn't sure.\n\nHe glanced up. Lee Percy stood over him.\n\n\"Roy, can I say something?\" Percy said diffidently.\n\n\"Go ahead,\" Walton said.\n\n\"I don't know how many millions I forked over to put you on the media\ntonight, but I know one thing--we threw a hell of a lot of money away.\"\n\nWalton sighed wearily. \"Why do you say that?\"\n\n\"That speech of yours,\" Percy said, \"was the speech of an amateur. You\nought to let pros handle the big spiels, Roy.\"\n\n\"I thought you liked the impromptu thing I did when they mobbed that\nHerschelite. How come no go tonight?\"\n\nPercy shook his head. \"The speech you made outside the building was\ndifferent. It had emotion; it had punch! But tonight you didn't come\nacross at all.\"\n\n\"No?\"\n\n\"I'd put money behind it.\" Acidly Percy said, \"You can't win the public\nopinion by being reasonable. You gave a nice smooth speech. Bland ...\nfolksy. You laid everything on the line where they could see it.\"\n\n\"And that's wrong, is it?\" Walton closed his eyes for a moment. \"_Why?_\"\n\n\"Because they won't listen! You gave them a sermon when you should have\nbeen punching at them! Sweet reason! You can't be _sweet_ if you want\nto sell your product to seven billion morons!\"\n\n\"Is that all they are?\" Walton asked. \"Just morons?\"\n\nPercy chuckled. \"In the long run, yes. Give them their daily bread and\ntheir one room to live in, and they won't give a damn what happens\nto the world. FitzMaugham sold them Popeek the way you'd sell a car\nwithout turbines. He hoodwinked them into buying something they hadn't\nthought about or wanted.\"\n\n\"They _needed_ Popeek, whether they wanted it or not. No one needs a\ncar without turbines.\"\n\n\"Bad analogy, then,\" Percy said. \"But it's true. They don't care a\nblast about Popeek, except where it affects them. If you'd told them\nthat these aliens would kill them all if they didn't act nice, you'd\nhave gotten across. But this sweetness and light business--oh, no, Roy.\nIt just doesn't work.\"\n\n\"Is that all you have to tell me?\" Walton asked.\n\n\"I guess so. I just wanted to show you where you had a big chance and\nmuffed it. Where we could have helped you out if you'd let us. I don't\nwant you to think I'm being rude or critical, Roy; I'm just trying to\nbe helpful.\"\n\n\"Okay, Lee. Get out.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"Go away. Go sell ice to the Eskimos. Leave me alone, yes?\"\n\n\"If that's the way you want it. Hell, Roy, don't brood over it. We can\nstill fix things up before that alien gets here. We can put the content\nof tonight's speech across so smoothly that they won't even know\nwe're--\"\n\n\"_Get out!_\"\n\nPercy skittered for the door. He paused and said, \"You're all wrought\nup, Roy. You ought to take a pill or something for your nerves.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWell, he had his answer. An expert evaluation of the content and effect\nof his speech.\n\nDammit, he had _tried_ to reach them. Percy said he hadn't, and Percy\nprobably was right, little as Walton cared to admit the fact to himself.\n\nBut was Percy's approach the only one? Did you have to lie to them,\npush them, treat them as seven billion morons?\n\nMaybe. Right now billions of human beings--the same human beings Walton\nwas expending so much energy to save--were staring at the kaleidowhirl\nprograms on their videos. Their eyes were getting fixed, glassy. Their\nmouths were beginning to sag open, their cheeks to wobble, their lips\nto droop pendulously, as the hypnosis of the color patterns took effect.\n\nThis was humanity. They were busy forgetting all the things they had\njust been forced to listen to. All the big words, like _mandate_ and\n_eventually_ and _wholesale destruction_. Just so many harsh syllables\nto be wiped away by the soothing swirl of the colors.\n\nAnd somewhere else, possibly, a poet named Prior was listening to his\nbaby's coughing and trying to write a poem--a poem that Walton and a\nfew others would read excitedly, while the billions would ignore it.\n\nWalton saw that Percy was dead right: Roy Walton could never have sold\nPopeek to the world. But FitzMaugham, that cagy, devious genius, did\nit. By waving his hands before the public and saying abracadabra, he\nbamboozled them into approving Popeek before they knew what they were\nbeing sold.\n\nIt was a lousy trick, but FitzMaugham had realized that it had to be\ndone. Someone had killed him for it, but it was too late by then.\n\nAnd Walton saw that he had taken the wrong track by trying to be\nreasonable. Percy's callous description of humanity as \"seven billion\nmorons\" was uncomfortably close to the truth. Walton would have to make\nhis appeal to a more subliminal level.\n\nPerhaps, he thought, at the level of the kaleidowhirls, those endless\npatterns of colored light that were the main form of diversion for the\nGreat Unwashed.\n\n_I'll get to them_, Walton promised himself. _There can't be any\ndignity or nobility in human life with everyone crammed into one\nsardine can. So I'll treat them like the sardines they are, and hope\nI can turn them into the human beings they could be if they only had\nroom._\n\nHe rose, turned out the light, prepared to leave. He wondered if the\nlate Director FitzMaugham had ever faced an internal crisis of this\nsort, or whether FitzMaugham had known these truths innately from the\nstart.\n\nProbably, the latter was the case. FitzMaugham had been a genius, a\nsort of superman. But FitzMaugham was dead, and the man who carried on\nhis work was no genius. He was only a mere man.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe reports started filtering in the next morning. It went much as\nPercy had predicted.\n\n_Citizen_ was the most virulent. Under the sprawling headline, _WHO'S\nKIDDING WHO?_ the telefax sheet wanted to know what the \"mealy-mouthed\"\nPopeek director was trying to tell the world on all media the night\nbefore. They weren't sure, since Walton, according to _Citizen_, had\nbeen talking in \"hifalutin prose picked on purpose to befuddle John Q.\nPublic.\" But their general impression was that Walton had proposed some\nsort of sellout to the Dirnans.\n\nThe sellout idea prevailed in most of the cheap telefax sheets.\n\n\"Behind a cloud of words, Popeek czar Walton is selling the world\ndownstream to the greenskins,\" said one paper. \"His talk last night was\nstrictly bunk. His holy-holy words and grim face were supposed to put\nover something, but we ain't fooled--and don't you be fooled either,\nfriend!\"\n\nThe video commentators were a little kinder, but not very. One called\nfor a full investigation of the Earth-Dirna situation. Another wanted\nto know why Walton, an appointed official and not even a permanent\none at that, had taken it upon himself to handle such high-power\nnegotiations. The UN seemed a little worried about that, even though\nLudwig had made a passionate speech insisting that negotiations with\nDirna were part of Walton's allotted responsibilities.\n\nThat touched off a new ruckus. \"How much power does Walton have?\"\n_Citizen_ demanded in a later edition. \"Is he the boss of the world?\nAnd if he is, who the devil is he anyway?\"\n\nThat struck Walton harder than all the other blows. He had been\ngradually realizing that he did, in fact, control what amounted to\ndictatorial powers over the world. But he had not yet fully admitted it\nto himself, and it hurt to be accused of it publicly.\n\nOne thing was clear: his attempt at sincerity and clarity had been\na total failure. The world was accustomed to subterfuge and verbal\npyrotechnics, and when it didn't get the expected commodity, it grew\nsuspicious. Sincerity had no market value. By going before the public\nand making a direct appeal, Walton had aroused the suspicion that he\nhad something hidden up his sleeve.\n\nWhen _Citizen's_ third edition of the day openly screamed for war with\nDirna, Walton realized the time had come to stop playing it clean. From\nnow on, he would chart his course and head there at any cost.\n\nHe tore a sheet of paper from his memo pad and inscribed on it a brief\nmotto: _The ends justify the means!_\n\nWith that as his guide, he was ready to get down to work.\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\n\nMartinez, security head for the entire Appalachia district, was a\nsmall, slight man with unruly hair and deep, piercing eyes. He stared\nlevelly at Walton and said, \"Sellors has been with security for twenty\nyears. It's absurd to suggest that he's disloyal.\"\n\n\"He's made a great many mistakes,\" Walton remarked. \"I'm simply\nsuggesting that if he's not utterly incompetent he must be in someone\nelse's pay.\"\n\n\"And you want us to break a man on your say-so, Director Walton?\"\nMartinez shook his head fussily. \"I'm afraid I can't see that. Of\ncourse, if you're willing to go through the usual channels, you could\nconceivably request a change of personnel in this district. But I don't\nsee how else--\"\n\n\"Sellors will have to go,\" Walton said. \"Our operation has sprung too\nmany leaks. We'll need a new man in here at once, and I want you to\ndouble-check him personally.\"\n\nMartinez rose. The little man's nostrils flickered ominously. \"I\nrefuse. Security is external to whims and fancies. If I remove Sellors,\nit will undermine security self-confidence all throughout the country.\"\n\n\"All right,\" sighed Walton. \"Sellors stays. I'll file a request to have\nhim transferred, though.\"\n\n\"I'll pigeonhole it. I can vouch for Sellors' competence myself,\"\nMartinez snapped. \"Popeek is in good hands, Mr. Walton. Please believe\nthat.\"\n\nMartinez left. Walton glowered at the retreating figure. He knew\nMartinez was honest--but the security head was a stubborn man, and\nrather than admit the existence of a flaw in the security structure he\nhad erected, Martinez would let a weak man continue in a vital position.\n\nWell, that blind spot in Martinez' makeup would have to be compensated\nfor, Walton thought. One way or another, he would have to get rid of\nSellors and replace him with a security man he could trust.\n\nHe scribbled a hasty note and sent it down the chute to Lee Percy. As\nWalton anticipated, the public relations man phoned minutes later.\n\n\"Roy, what's this release you want me to get out? It's\nfantastic--Sellors a spy? How? He hasn't even been arrested. I just saw\nhim in the building.\"\n\nWalton smirked. \"Since when do you have such a high respect for\naccuracy?\" he asked. \"Send out the release and we'll watch what\nhappens.\"\n\nThe 1140 newsblares were the first to carry the news. Walton listened\ncheerlessly as they revealed that Security Chief Sellors had been\narrested on charges of disloyalty. According to informed sources, said\nthe blares, Sellors was now in custody and had agreed to reveal the\nnature of the secret conspiracy which had hired him.\n\nAt 1210 came a later report: Security Chief Sellors had temporarily\nbeen released from custody.\n\nAnd at 1230 came a still later report: Security Chief Sellors had been\nassassinated by an unknown hand outside the Cullen Building.\n\nWalton listened to the reports with cold detachment. He had foreseen\nthe move: Sellors' panicky employers had silenced the man for good.\n_The ends justify the means_, Walton told himself. There was no reason\nto feel pity for Sellors; he had been a spy and death was the penalty.\nIt made no real difference whether death came in a federal gas chamber\nor as the result of some carefully faked news releases.\n\nMartinez called almost immediately after word of Sellors' murder\nreached the blares. The little man's face was deadly pale.\n\n\"I owe you an apology,\" he said. \"I acted like an idiot this morning.\"\n\n\"Don't blame yourself,\" Walton said. \"It was only natural that you'd\ntrust Sellors; you'd known him so long. But you can't trust anyone\nthese days, Martinez. Not even yourself.\"\n\n\"I will have to resign,\" the security man said.\n\n\"No. It wasn't your fault. Sellors was a spy and a bungler, and he paid\nthe price. His own men struck him down when that rumor escaped that he\nwas going to inform. Just send me a new man, as I asked--and make him a\ngood one!\"\n\nKeeler, the new security attach\u00e9, was a crisp-looking man in his early\nthirties. He reported directly to Walton as soon as he reached the\nbuilding.\n\n\"You're Sellors' replacement, eh? Glad to see you, Keeler.\" Walton\nstudied him. He looked tough and hard and thoroughly incorruptible.\n\"I've a couple of jobs I'd like you to start on right away. First, you\nknow Sellors was looking for a man named Lamarre. Let me fill you in on\nthat, and--\"\n\n\"No need for that,\" Keeler said. \"I was the man Sellors put on the\nLamarre chase. There isn't a trace of him anywhere. We've got feelers\nout all over the planet now, and no luck.\"\n\n\"Hmm.\" Walton was mildly annoyed; he had been wishfully hoping Sellors\nhad found Lamarre and had simply covered up the fact. But if Keeler had\nbeen the one who handled the search, there was no hope of that.\n\n\"All right,\" Walton said. \"Keep on the hunt for Lamarre. At the moment\nI want you to give this building a thorough scouring. There's no\ntelling how many spy pickups Sellors planted here. Top to bottom, and\nreport back to me when the job is done.\"\n\nNext on Walton's schedule was a call from communications. He received\nit and a technician told him, \"There's been a call from the Venus ship.\nDo you want it, sir?\"\n\n\"Of course!\"\n\n\"It says, 'Arrived Venus June fifteen late, no sign of Lang outfit yet.\nWell keep looking and will report daily.' It's signed, 'Spencer.'\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Walton said. \"Thanks. And if any further word from them comes,\nlet me have it right away.\"\n\nThe fate of the Lang expedition, Walton reflected, was not of immediate\nimportance. But he would like to know what had happened to the group.\nHe hoped Spencer and his rescue mission had something more concrete to\nreport tomorrow.\n\nThe annunciator chimed. \"Dr. Frederic Walton is on the line, sir. He\nsays it's urgent.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Walton said. He switched over and waited for his brother's face\nto appear on the screen. A nervous current of anticipation throbbed in\nhim.\n\n\"Well, Fred?\" he asked at length.\n\n\"You've been a busy little bee, haven't you?\" Fred said. \"I understand\nyou have a new security chief to watch over you.\"\n\n\"I don't have time to make conversation now,\" Walton snapped.\n\n\"Nor do I. You fooled us badly, with that newsbreak on Sellors. You\nforced us into wiping out a useful contact prematurely.\"\n\n\"Not so useful,\" Walton said. \"I was on to him. If you hadn't killed\nhim, I would have had to handle the job myself. You saved me the\ntrouble.\"\n\n\"My, my! Getting ruthless, aren't we!\"\n\n\"When the occasion demands,\" Walton said.\n\n\"Fair enough. We'll play the same way.\" Fred's eyes narrowed. \"You\nrecall our conversation in the Bronze Room the other day, Roy?\"\n\n\"Vividly.\"\n\n\"I've called to ask for your decision,\" Fred said. \"One way or the\nother.\"\n\nWalton was caught off guard. \"But you said I had a week's grace!\"\n\n\"The period has been halved,\" Fred said. \"We now see it's necessary to\naccelerate things.\"\n\n\"Tell me what you want me to do. Then I'll give you my answer.\"\n\n\"It's simple enough. You're to resign in my favor. If it's not done\nby nightfall tomorrow, we'll find it necessary to release the Lamarre\nserum. Those are our terms, and don't try to bargain with me.\"\n\nWalton was silent for a moment, contemplating his brother's cold face\non the screen. Finally he said, \"It takes time to get such things done.\nI can't just resign overnight.\"\n\n\"FitzMaugham did.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes--if you call that a resignation. But unless you want to\ninherit the same sort of chaos I did, you'd better give me a little\ntime to prepare things.\"\n\nFred's eyes gleamed. \"Does that mean you'll yield? You'll resign in my\nfavor?\"\n\n\"There's no guarantee the UN will accept you,\" Walton warned. \"Even\nwith my recommendation, I can't promise a one hundred percent chance of\nsuccess.\"\n\n\"We'll have to risk it,\" said Fred. \"The important step is getting you\nout of there. When can I have confirmation of all this?\"\n\nWalton eyed his brother shrewdly. \"Come up to my office tomorrow at\nthis time. I'll have everything set up for you by then, and I'll be\nable to show you how the Popeek machinery works. That's one advantage\nyou'll have over me. FitzMaugham kept half the workings in his head.\"\n\nFred grinned savagely. \"I'll see you then, Roy.\" Chuckling, he added,\n\"I knew all that ruthlessness of yours was just skin deep. You never\nwere tough, Roy.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWalton glanced at his watch after Fred had left the screen. The time\nwas 1100. It had been a busy morning.\n\nBut some of the vaguenesses were beginning to look sharper. He knew,\nfor instance, that Sellors had been in the pay of the same organization\nthat backed Fred. Presumably, this meant that FitzMaugham had been\nassassinated by the landed gentry.\n\nBut for what reason? Surely, not simply for the sake of assassination.\nHad they cared to, they might have killed FitzMaugham whenever they\npleased.\n\nHe saw now why the assassination had been timed as it had. By the time\nthe conspirators had realized that Walton was sure to be the old man's\nsuccessor, Fred had already joined their group. They had ready leverage\non the prospective director. They knew they could shove him out of\noffice almost as quickly as he got in, and supplant him with their\npuppet, Fred.\n\nWell, they were in for a surprise. Fred was due to appear at Walton's\noffice at 1100 on the morning of the seventeenth to take over command.\nWalton planned to be ready for them by then.\n\nThere was the matter of Lamarre. Walton wanted the little scientist and\nhis formula badly. But by this time Fred had certainly made at least\none copy of Lamarre's documents; the threat would remain, whether or\nnot Popeek recovered the originals.\n\nWalton had twenty-four hours to act. He called up Sue Llewellyn,\nPopeek's comptroller.\n\n\"Sue, how's our budget looking?\"\n\n\"What's on your mind, Roy?\"\n\n\"Plenty. I want to know if I can make an expenditure of--say, a\nbillion, between now and nightfall.\"\n\n\"A _billion_? You joking, Roy?\"\n\n\"Hardly.\" Walton's tone was grim. \"I hope I won't need it all. But\nthere's a big purchase I want to make ... an investment. Can you\nsqueeze out the money? It doesn't matter where you squeeze it from,\neither, because if we don't get it by nightfall there probably won't be\na Popeek by the day after tomorrow.\"\n\n\"What _are_ you talking about, Roy?\"\n\n\"Give me a yes or no answer. And if the answer's not the one I want to\nhear, I'm afraid you can start looking for a new job, Sue.\"\n\nShe uttered a little gasp. Then she said, \"Okay, Roy. I'll play along\nwith you, even if it bankrupts us. There's a billion at your disposal\nas of now, though Lord knows what I'll use for a payroll next week.\"\n\n\"You'll have it back,\" Walton promised. \"With compound interest.\"\n\nHis next call was to a man he had once dealt with in his capacity of\nsecretary to Senator FitzMaugham. He was Noel Hervey, a registered\nsecurities and exchange slyster.\n\nHervey was a small, worried-looking little man, but his unflickering\neyes belied his ratty appearance. \"What troubles you, Roy?\"\n\n\"I want you to make a stock purchase for me, pronto. Within an hour,\nsay?\"\n\nHervey shook his head instantly. \"Sorry, Roy. I'm all tied up on a hefty\nmonorail deal. Won't be free until Wednesday or Thursday, if by then.\"\n\nWalton said, \"What sort of money will you be making on this big deal of\nyours, Noel?\"\n\n\"Confidential! You wouldn't invade a man's privacy on a delicate matter\nlike--\"\n\n\"Will it be worth five million dollars for you, Noel?\"\n\n\"Five million--hey, is this a gag?\"\n\n\"I'm awfully serious,\" Walton said. \"I want you to swing a deal for me,\nright away. You've heard my price.\"\n\nHervey smiled warmly. \"Well, start talking, friend. Consider me hired.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA few other matters remained to be tended to hurriedly. Walton spent\nsome moments talking to a communications technician, then sent out an\norder for three or four technical books--_Basic Kaleidowhirl Theory_\nand related works. He sent a note to Lee Percy requesting him to stop\nby and see him in an hour, and told his annunciator that for no reason\nwhatsoever was he to be disturbed for the next sixty minutes.\n\nThe hour passed rapidly; by its end, Walton's head was slightly\ndizzy from too much skimming, but his mind was thrumming with new\npossibilities, with communications potentials galore. Talk about\nreaching people! He had a natural!\n\nHe flipped on the annunciator. \"Is Mr. Percy here yet?\"\n\n\"No, sir. Should I send for him?\"\n\n\"Yes. He's due here any minute to see me. Have there been any calls?\"\n\n\"Quite a few. I've relayed them down to Mr. Eglin's office, as\ninstructed.\"\n\n\"Good girl,\" Walton said.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Percy's here. And there's a call for you from communications.\"\n\nWalton frowned. \"Tell Percy to wait outside a minute or two. Give me\nthe call.\"\n\nThe communications tech on the screen was grinning excitedly. He said,\n\"Subspace message just came in for you, sir.\"\n\n\"From Venus?\"\n\n\"No, sir. From Colonel McLeod.\"\n\n\"Let's have it,\" Walton said.\n\nThe technician read, \"'To Walton from McLeod, via subspace radio: Have\nmade successful voyage to Procyon system, and am on way back with\nDirnan ambassador on board. See you soon, and good luck--you'll need\nit.'\"\n\n\"Good. That all?\"\n\n\"That's all, sir.\"\n\n\"Okay. Keep me posted.\" He broke contact and turned to the annunciator.\nExcitement put a faint quiver in his voice. \"You can send in Mr. Percy\nnow,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\n\nWalton looked up at the public relations man and said, \"How much do you\nknow about kaleidowhirls, Lee?\"\n\n\"Not a hell of a lot. I never watch the things, myself. They're bad for\nthe eyes.\"\n\nWalton smiled. \"That makes you a nonconformist, doesn't it? According\nto the figures I have here, the nightly kaleidowhirl programs are\ntop-ranked on the rating charts.\"\n\n\"Maybe so,\" Percy said cautiously. \"I still don't like to watch them.\nWhat goes, Roy?\"\n\n\"I've suddenly become very interested in kaleidowhirls myself,\" Walton\nsaid. He leaned back and added casually, \"I think they can be used as\npropaganda devices. My brother's reaction to one gave me the idea,\ncouple days ago, at the Bronze Room. For the past hour or so, I've been\nstudying kaleidowhirls in terms of information theory. Did you know\nthat it's possible to get messages across via kaleidowhirl?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Percy gasped. \"But the Communications Commission would\nnever let you get away with it!\"\n\n\"By the time the Communications Commission found out what had been\ndone,\" Walton said calmly, \"we wouldn't be doing it any more. They\nwon't be able to prove a thing.\" Sarcastically he added, \"After\nspending a lifetime in public relations, you're not suddenly getting a\nrush of ethics, are you?\"\n\n\"Well ... let's have the details, then.\"\n\n\"Simple enough,\" Walton said. \"We feed through a verbal\nmessage--something like _Hooray for Popeek_ or _I Don't Want War With\nDirna_. We flash it on the screen for, say, a microsecond, then cover\nit up with kaleidowhirl patterns. Wait two minutes, then flash it\nagain. Plenty of noise, but the signal will get through if we flash it\noften enough.\"\n\n\"And it'll get through deep down,\" Percy said. \"Subliminally. They\nwon't even realize that they're being indoctrinated, but suddenly\nthey'll have a new set of opinions about Popeek and Dirna!\" He\nshuddered. \"Roy, I hate to think what can happen if someone else gets\nto thinking about this and puts on his own kaleidowhirl show.\"\n\n\"I've thought of that. After the Dirna crisis is over--after we've put\nover our point--I'm going to take steps to make sure no one can use\nthis sort of weapon again. I'm going to frame someone into putting on a\npropaganda kaleidowhirl, and then catch him in the act. That ought to\nbe sufficient to wise up the Communications Commission.\"\n\n\"In other words,\" Percy said, \"you're willing to use this technique\n_now_. But since you don't want anyone else to use it, you're willing\nto give up future use of it yourself as soon as the Dirna trouble is\nover.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\" Walton shoved the stack of textbooks over to the PR man.\n\"Read these through first. Get yourself familiar with the setup. Then\nbuy a kaleidowhirl hour and get a bunch of our engineers in there to\nhandle the special inserts. Okay?\"\n\n\"It's nasty, but I like it. When do you want the program to begin?\"\n\n\"Tomorrow. Tonight, if you can work it. And set up a poll of some kind\nto keep check on the program's effectiveness. I want two messages\nkaleidowhirled alternately: one supporting Popeek, one demanding a\npeaceful settlement with the aliens. Have your pulse takers feel out\nthe populace on those two propositions, and report any fluctuation to\nme immediately.\"\n\n\"Got it.\"\n\n\"Oh, one more thing. I suspect you'll have some extra responsibilities\nas of tomorrow, Lee.\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"Your office will have one additional medium to deal with. Telefax. I'm\nbuying _Citizen_ and we're going to turn it into a pro-Popeek rag.\"\n\nPercy's mouth dropped in astonishment; then he started to laugh.\n\"You're a wonder, Roy. A genuine wonder.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMoments after Percy departed, Noel Hervey, the security and exchange\nslyster, called.\n\n\"Well?\" Walton asked.\n\nHervey looked preoccupied. \"I've successfully spent a couple of hundred\nmillion of Popeek's money in the last half-hour, Roy. You now own the\nsingle biggest block of _Citizen_ stock there is.\"\n\n\"How much is that?\"\n\n\"One hundred fifty-two thousand shares. Approximately thirty-three\npercent.\"\n\n\"Thirty-three percent! What about the other eighteen percent?\"\n\n\"Patience, lad, patience. I know my job. I snapped up all the small\nholdings there were, very quietly. It cost me a pretty penny to farm\nout the purchases, too.\"\n\n\"Why'd you do that?\" Walton asked.\n\n\"Because this has to be handled very gingerly. You know the ownership\nsetup of _Citizen_?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, it goes like this: Amalgamated Telefax owns a twenty-six percent\nchunk, and Horace Murlin owns twenty-five percent. Since Murlin also\nowns Amalgamated, he votes fifty-one percent of the stock, even though\nit isn't registered that way. The other forty-nine percent doesn't\nmatter, Murlin figures. So I'm busy gathering up as much of it as I\ncan for you--under half a dozen different brokerage names. I doubt\nthat I can get it all, but I figure on rounding up at least forty-nine\npercent. Then I'll approach Murlin with a Big Deal and sucker him into\nselling me six percent of his _Citizen_ stock. He'll check around, find\nout that the remaining stock is splintered ninety-seven different ways,\nand he'll probably let go of a little of his, figuring he still has\ncontrol.\"\n\n\"Suppose he doesn't?\" Walton asked.\n\n\"Don't worry,\" Hervey said confidently. \"He will. I've got a billion\nsmackers to play with, don't I? I'll cook up a deal so juicy he can't\nresist it--and all he'll have to do to take a flyer will be to peel off\na little of his _Citizen_ stock. The second he does that, I transfer\nall the fragmented stock to you. With your controlling majority of\nfifty-one percent, you boot Murlin off the Board, and the telefax sheet\nis yours! Simple? Clear?\"\n\n\"Perfectly,\" Walton said. \"Okay. Keep in touch.\"\n\nHe broke contact and walked to the window. The street was packed with\npeople scrambling in every direction, like so many ants moving at\nrandom over the ground. Many of them clutched telefax sheets--and the\nmost popular one was the _Citizen_. Many of them would gape and goggle\nat kaleidowhirl programs, come evening.\n\nWalton suddenly tightened his fist. In just that way, he thought,\nPopeek was tightening its hold on the public by capturing the mass\nmedia. If Hervey's confidence had any justification in truth, they\nwould own the leading anti-Popeek telefax sheet by tomorrow. With\nsubtle handling over the course of several days, they could swing\nthe slant of _Citizen_ around to a pro-Popeek stand, and do it so\nsurreptitiously that it would seem as though the sheet had never had\nany other policy.\n\nAs for the kaleidowhirl subterfuge--that, Walton admitted, was hitting\nbelow the belt. But he had resolved that all would be fair during the\ncurrent crisis. There would be time enough for morality after war had\nbeen averted.\n\nAt about 1430 that day, Walton took advantage of a lull in activities\nto have a late lunch at the Bronze Room. He felt that he had to get\naway from the confining walls of his office for at least some part of\nthe afternoon.\n\nThe Bronze Room had adopted cerise as its color scheme for the day.\nWalton selected a private room, lunched lightly on baked chlorella\nsteak and filtered rum, and dialed a twelve-minute nap. When the alarm\nsystem in the foamweb couch stirred him to wakefulness, he stretched\nhappily, some of the choking tension having been washed out of him.\n\nThoughtfully, he switched on the electroluminescent kaleidoscope and\nstared at it. It worked on the same principle as the kaleidowhirl\nprograms beamed over the public video, except that the Bronze Room\nprovided closed-channel beaming of its own kaleidoscopic patterns;\ntending more to soft greens and pale rose, they were on a higher\nesthetic plane, certainly, than the jagged, melodramatic purples and\nreds the video channels sent out for popular consumption.\n\nBut it was with a certain new apprehension that Walton now studied the\nkaleidoscopic pattern. Now that he knew what a dangerous weapon the\nflashing colors could be, how could he be certain that the Bronze Room\nproprietors were not flashing some scarcely seen subliminal command at\nhim this very moment?\n\nHe turned the set off with a brusque gesture.\n\n_The ends justify the means._ A nice homily, he thought, which allowed\nhim to do almost anything. It brought to mind the rationale of Ivan\nKaramazov: without God, everything is permissible.\n\nBut both God and Dostoevski seem to be obsolete these days, he reminded\nhimself. God is now a lean young man with an office on the twenty-ninth\nfloor of the Cullen Building--and as for Dostoevski, all he did was\nwrite books, and therefore could not have been of any great importance.\n\nHe felt a tremor of self-doubt. Maybe it had been unwise to let\nkaleidowhirl propaganda loose on the world; once unleashed, it might\nnot be so easily caged again. He realized that as soon as the Popeek\ncampaign was over, he would have to make sure some method was devised\nfor pre-checking all public and closed-channel kaleidoscopic patterns.\n\nThe most damnable part of such propaganda techniques, he knew, was that\nyou could put over almost any idea at all without arousing suspicion on\nthe part of the viewer. He wouldn't know he'd been tampered with; you\ncould tell him so, after the new idea had been planted, and by then he\nwouldn't believe you.\n\nWalton dialed another filtered rum, and lifted it to his lips with a\nslightly shaky hand.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Mr. Ludwig of the United Nations called while you were out, sir,\"\nWalton was told upon returning to his office. \"He'd like you to call\nhim back.\"\n\n\"Very well. Make the connection for me.\"\n\nWhen Ludwig appeared, Walton said, \"Sorry I missed your call. What's\nhappening?\"\n\n\"Special session of the Security Council just broke up. They passed\na resolution unanimously and shipped it on to the Assembly. There's\ngoing to be an immediate hearing to determine the new permanent head of\nPopeek.\"\n\nWalton clamped his lips together. After a moment he said, \"How come?\"\n\n\"The Dirnan crisis. They don't want a mere interim director handling\nthings. They feel the man dealing with the aliens ought to have full UN\nblessing.\"\n\n\"Should I interpret that to mean I get the job automatically?\"\n\n\"I couldn't swear to it,\" said Ludwig. \"General consensus certainly\nfavors you to continue. I'd advise that you show up at the hearing in\nperson and present your program in detail; otherwise they may stick\nsome smooth-talking politico in your place. The noise is slated to\nstart at 1100, day after tomorrow. The eighteenth.\"\n\n\"I'll be there,\" Walton said. \"Thanks for the tip.\"\n\nHe chewed the end of his stylus for a moment, then hastily scribbled\ndown the appointment. As of now, he knew he couldn't worry too strongly\nabout events taking place the day after tomorrow--not with Fred\narriving for a show-down the next morning.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next day began busily enough. Hervey was the first to call.\n\n\"The _Citizen's_ sewed up, Roy! I had dinner with Murlin last night and\nweaseled him out of four percent of _Citizen_ stock in exchange for a\nfancy tip on the new monorail project out Nevada way. He was grinning\nall over the place--but I'll bet he's grinning out of the other side of\nhis mouth this morning.\"\n\n\"Is it all arranged?\" Walton asked.\n\n\"In the bag. I was up by 0700 and consolidating my holdings--_your_\nholdings, I mean. Forty-seven percent of the stock I had fragmented in\na dozen different outfits; the other two percent outstanding belonged\nto rich widows who wouldn't sell. I lumped the forty-seven percent\ntogether in your name, then completed the transfer on Murlin's four\npercent and stuck that in there too. _Citizen_ telefax is now the\nproperty of Popeek, Roy!\"\n\n\"Fine work. How much did it cost?\"\n\nThen he said, \"Four hundred eighty-three million and some change. Plus\nmy usual five percent commission, which in this case comes to about two\nand a quarter million.\"\n\n\"But I offered you five million,\" Walton said. \"That offer still goes.\"\n\n\"You want me to lose my license? I spend years placing bribes to get a\nslyster's license, and you want me to throw it away for an extra couple\nmillion? Uh-uh. I'll settle for two and a quarter, and damn good doing\nI call that for a day's work.\"\n\nWalton grinned. \"You win. And Sue Llewellyn will be glad to know it\ndidn't cost the whole billion to grab _Citizen_. You'll be over with\nthe papers, won't you?\"\n\n\"About 1000,\" the slyster said. \"I've gotta follow through for Murlin\non his monorail deal first. The poor sucker! See you in an hour.\"\n\n\"Right.\"\n\nRapidly Walton scribbled memos. As soon as the papers were in his\nhands, he'd serve notice on Murlin that a stock-holders' meeting was\nto be held at once. After that, he'd depose Murlin, fire the present\n_Citizen_ editors, and pack the telefax sheet with men loyal to Popeek.\n\nFred was due at 1100. Walton buzzed Keeler, the new security chief, and\nsaid, \"Keeler, I have an appointment with someone at 1100. I want you\nto station three men outside my door and frisk him for weapons as he\ncomes in.\"\n\n\"We'd do that anyway, sir. It's standard procedure now.\"\n\n\"Good. But I want you to be one of the three. And make sure the two who\ncome with you are tight-mouthed. I don't want _any_ newsbreaks on this.\"\n\n\"Right, sir.\"\n\n\"Okay. Be there about 1050 or so. About 1115, I'm going to press\nmy door opener, and I want you and your men to break in, arrest my\nvisitor, and spirit him off to the deepest dungeon security has. And\nleave him there. If Martinez wants to know what's going on, tell him\nI'll take responsibility.\"\n\nKeeler looked vaguely puzzled, but merely nodded. \"We frisk him first,\nthen let him talk to you for fifteen minutes. Then we come in on signal\nand take him away. I've got it.\"\n\n\"This man's a dangerous anti-Popeek conspirator. Make sure he's drugged\nbefore he gets out of my office. I don't want him making noise.\"\n\nThe annunciator sounded. \"Man from communications has a message for\nyou, Mr. Walton.\"\n\nHe switched over from Keeler to communications and said, \"Go ahead.\"\n\n\"From McLeod, Mr. Walton. We just got it. It says, 'Arriving Nairobi on\nthe 18th, will be in your office with Dirnan following morning if he\nfeels like making the trip. Otherwise will you come to Nairobi?'\"\n\n\"Tell him yes, if necessary,\" Walton said.\n\nHe glanced at his watch. 0917. It looked like it was going to be hectic\nall day.\n\nAnd Fred was due at 1100.\n\n\n\n\nXVI\n\n\nHervey showed up at 1003, grinning broadly. He unfolded a thick wad of\ndocuments and thrust them at Walton.\n\n\"I hold in my hand the world's most potent telefax sheet,\" Hervey said.\nHe flipped the documents casually onto Walton's desk and laughed.\n\"They're all yours. Fifty-one percent, every bit of it voting stock.\nI told Murlin about it just before I left him this morning. He turned\npurple.\"\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\n\"What _could_ he say? I asked him offhandedly if he knew where all the\noutstanding _Citizen_ stock was, and he said yes, it was being held by\na lot of small holders. And then I told him that somebody was buying\nout the small holders, and that I was selling my four percent to him.\nThat's when he started to change colors. When I left he was busy making\nphone calls, but I don't think he'll like what he's going to find out.\"\n\nWalton riffled through the papers. \"It's all here, eh? Fine work. I'll\nput through your voucher in half an hour or so, unless you're in a\nhurry.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't rush,\" Hervey said. He ran a finger inside his collar.\n\"Couple of security boys outside, y'know. They really gave me a\ngoing-over.\"\n\n\"I'm expecting an assassin at 1100,\" Walton said lightly. \"They're on\nthe lookout.\"\n\n\"Oh? A close friend?\"\n\n\"A relative,\" Walton said.\n\nFred arrived promptly at 1100. By that time Walton had already set the\nmachinery in operation for the taking-over of _Citizen_.\n\nThe first step had been to call Horace Murlin and confirm the fact that\nPopeek now owned the telefax sheet. Murlin's fleshy face was a curious\nshade of rose-purple; he sputtered at Walton for five minutes before\nadmitting he was beaten.\n\nWith Murlin out of the way, Walton selected a new editorial staff for\nthe paper from a list Percy supplied. He intended to keep the reporting\ncrew of the old regime intact; _Citizen_ had a fantastically efficient\nnewsgathering team, and there was no point in breaking it up. It was\nthe policy-making level Walton was interested in controlling.\n\nThe 1000 edition of _Citizen_ was the last under the old editors. They\nhad received word from Murlin about what had happened, and by 1030,\nwhen Walton sent his dismissal notices over, they were already cleaning\nout their desks.\n\nThat 1000 edition was a beauty, though. The lead headline read:\n\n    _ARE WE CHUMPS FOR THE GREENSKINS?_\n\nAnd most of the issue was devoted to inflammatory pro-war anti-Popeek\njournalism. A full page of \"letters from the readers\"--actually\ntranscribed phone calls, since few of _Citizen's_ readers were\ninterested in writing letters--echoed the editorial stand. One \"letter\"\nin particular caught Walton's attention.\n\nIt was from a Mrs. P.F. of New York City Environ, which probably meant\nJersey or lower Connecticut, and it was short and to the point:\n\n    _To the Editor_--\n\n    _Horray for you. Popeek is a damned crime and that Walton criminal\n    ought to be put away and we ought to kill those greenskins up there\n    before they kill us. We gotta have room to live._\n\n_Kill them before they kill us._ Walton snickered. All the old\nhysterias, the old panic reactions, come boiling up again in times of\nstress.\n\nHe looked at his hand. It was perfectly steady, even though his wrist\nwatch told him Fred would be here in just a few minutes. A week ago, a\nsituation like this would have had him gobbling benzolurethrin as fast\nas he could unwrap the lozenges.\n\nThe ghostly presence of FitzMaugham seemed to hover in the room. _The\nends justify the means_, Walton told himself grimly, as he waited for\nhis brother to arrive.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFred was dressed completely in black, from his stylish neo-Victorian\nwaistcoat and the bit of ribbon at his throat to the mirror-bright\nleather pumps on his feet. The splendor of his clothing was curiously\nat odds with the coarseness of his features and the stockiness of his\nbody.\n\nHe walked into Walton's office at the stroke of 1100 and sighed\ndeeply--the sigh of a man about to take permanent possession. \"Good\nmorning, Roy. I'm on time, as always.\"\n\n\"And looking radiant, my dear brother.\" Walton gestured appreciatively\nat Fred's clothes. \"It's been a long time since I've seen you in\nanything but your lab smock.\"\n\n\"I gave notice at the lab yesterday, night after I spoke to you. I'm\nno longer an employee of Popeek. And I felt I should dress with the\ndignity suitable to my new rank.\" He grinned buoyantly. \"Well, ready to\nturn over the orb and scepter, Roy?\"\n\n\"Not exactly,\" Walton said.\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"But I promised you I'd resign in your favor today, Fred. I don't think\nI ever used those words, but I certainly implied it, didn't I?\"\n\n\"Of course you did. You told me to come here at 1100 and you'd arrange\nthe transfer.\"\n\nWalton nodded. \"Exactly so.\" He waited a long moment and then said\nquietly, \"I lied, Fred.\"\n\nHe had chosen the words carefully, for maximum impact. He had not\nchosen wrongly.\n\nFor a brief instant Fred's face was very pale against the blackness of\nhis garb. Total disbelief flickered across his eyes and mouth.\n\nWalton had considered his brother's mental picture of him--the elder\nbrother, virtuous, devoted to hard work, kind to animals, and just a\nlittle soft in the head. Also, extremely honest.\n\nFred hadn't expected Walton to be lying. And the calm admission stunned\nhim.\n\n\"You're not planning to go through with it, then?\" Fred asked in a dead\nvoice.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You realize what this means in terms of the serum, don't you? The\nmoment I get out of here and transmit your refusal to my employers,\nthey'll begin wholesale manufacture and distribution of the Lamarre\nserum. The publicity won't be good, Roy. Nor the result.\"\n\n\"You won't get out of here,\" Walton said.\n\nAnother shock wave rippled over Fred's face. \"You can't be serious,\nRoy. My employers know where I am; they know what I'm here for. If they\ndon't hear from me within twenty-four hours, they'll proceed with serum\ndistribution. You can't hope to--\"\n\n\"I'll risk it,\" Walton interrupted. \"If nothing else, I'll have a\ntwenty-four extension. You didn't really think I could hand Popeek over\nto you on a platter, Fred? Why, I don't even know how secure my _own_\nposition is here. So I'm afraid I'll have to back down on my offer.\nYou're under arrest, Fred!\"\n\n\"_Arrest!_\" Fred sprang from his seat and circled around the desk\ntoward Walton. For a moment the two brothers stared at each other,\nfaces inches apart. Walton put one hand on his brother's shoulder and,\ngripping tightly, forced him around to the front of the desk.\n\n\"You had this all planned, didn't you?\" Fred said bitterly. \"Yesterday,\nwhen you talked to me, you knew this was what you were going to do.\nBut you said you'd yield, and I believed you! I don't fool easy, but I\nthought I had you pegged because you were my brother. I _knew_ you. You\nwouldn't do a sneaky thing like this.\"\n\n\"But I did,\" Walton said.\n\nSuddenly, Fred jumped. He charged at Walton blindly, head down.\n\nIn the same motion, Walton signaled for Keeler and his men to break\nin, and met Fred's charge. He caught his brother in midstride with a\nswinging punch that sent his head cracking back sharply.\n\nFred's face twisted and writhed, more in astonishment than pain. He\nstepped back, rubbing his chin. \"You've changed,\" he said. \"This job's\nmade you tough. A year ago you would never have done this to me.\"\n\nWalton shrugged. \"Look behind you, Fred. And this time you can trust\nme.\"\n\nFred turned warily. Keeler and two other gray-clad security men stood\nthere.\n\n\"Drug him and take him away,\" Walton said. \"Have him held in custody\nuntil I notify Martinez.\"\n\nFred's eyes widened. \"You're a _dictator_!\" he said hoarsely. \"You just\nmove people around like chessmen, Roy. Like chessmen.\"\n\n\"Drug him,\" Walton repeated.\n\nKeeler stepped forward, a tiny hypodermic spray cupped in his hand.\nHe activated it with a twitch of his thumb and touched it to Fred's\nforearm. A momentary hum droned in the office as the vibrating spray\nforced the drug into Fred's arm.\n\nHe slumped like an empty sack. \"Pick him up,\" Keeler ordered. \"Take him\nand let's get going.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe story broke in the 1300 edition of _Citizen_, and from the general\ntone of the piece Walton could see the fine hand of Lee Percy at work.\n\nThe headline was:\n\n    _GUY TRIES TO KNOCK OFF POPEEK HEAD_\n\nAfter the usual string of subheads, all in the cheerful, breezy, barely\nliterate _Citizen_ style, came the body of the story:\n\n    _A guy tried to bump Popeek top number Roy Walton today. Security\n    men got there in time to keep Walton from getting the same finisher\n    as dead Popeek boss FitzMaugham got last week._\n\n    _Walton says he's all right; the assassin didn't even come close. He\n    also told our man that he expects good news on the New Earth bit\n    soon. We like the sound of those words. Popeek may be with the\n    stream after all. Who knows?_\n\nThe voice was that of _Citizen_, but the man behind the voice was\nthinking a little differently. Had the previous editors of _Citizen_\nbeen handling the break, the prevailing tone would most likely have\nbeen too-bad-he-missed.\n\nWalton called Percy after the edition came out. \"Nice job you did on\nour first _Citizen_,\" he said approvingly. \"It's just what I want: same\nilliterate style, but a slow swerving of editorial slant until it's\ncompletely pro-Popeek.\"\n\n\"Wait till you see tomorrow's paper. We're just getting the hang of\nit! And we'll have our first kaleidowhirl show at 2000 tonight. Cost a\nfortune to buy in, but we figured that's the best hour.\"\n\n\"What's the buried message?\"\n\n\"As you said,\" Percy told him. \"A pro-Popeek job and some pacifist\nstuff. We've got a team of pollsters out now, and they say the\ncurrent's predominantly going the other way. We'll be able to tell if\nthe kaleidowhirl stuff works out, all right.\"\n\n\"Keep up the good work,\" Walton said. \"We'll get there yet. The alien\nisn't due to arrive for another day or so--McLeod gets into Nairobi\ntomorrow some time. I'm going to testify before the UN tomorrow, too. I\nhope those UN boys are watching our pretty color patterns tonight.\"\n\nPercy grinned. \"Boy, you bet!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWalton threw himself energetically into his work. It was taking shape,\nnow. There were still some loose ends, of course, but he was beginning\nto feel that some end to the tangle of interlocking intrigues was in\nsight.\n\nHe checked with a public recreation director and discovered there would\nbe a block forum on West 382nd Street at 1830 that night. He made a\nnote to attend, and arranged to have a synthetic mask fashioned so he\nwouldn't have to reveal his own identity.\n\nTwenty-four hours. In that time, Fred's employers would presumably\nbe readying themselves to loose Lamarre's serum on the world; an\nextraterrestrial being would be landing on Earth--and, by then, Walton\nwould have been called to render an account of his stewardship before\nthe United Nations.\n\nThe annunciator chimed again. \"Yes?\" Walton said.\n\n\"Mr. O'Mealia of Mount Palomar Observatory, calling long distance to\ntalk to you, sir.\"\n\n\"Put him on,\" Walton said puzzledly.\n\nO'Mealia was a red-faced individual with deep-set, compelling eyes.\nHe introduced himself as a member of the research staff at Mount\nPalomar. \"Glad I could finally reach you,\" he said, in a staccato burst\nof words. \"Been trying to call for an hour. Made some early-morning\nobservations of Venus a little while ago, and I thought you'd be\ninterested.\"\n\n\"Venus? What?\"\n\n\"Cloud blanket looks awfully funny, Mr. Walton. Blazing away like\nsixty. Got the whole staff down here to discuss it, and the way it\nlooks to us there's some sort of atomic chain-reaction going on in\nVenus' atmosphere. I think it's those terraforming men you Popeek folk\nhave up there. I think they've blown the whole place up!\"\n\n\n\n\nXVII\n\n\nWalton stepped off the jetbus at Broadway and West 382nd Street, paused\nfor a moment beneath a street lamp, and fingered his chin to see if his\nmask were on properly. It was.\n\nThree youths stood leaning against a nearby building. \"Could you tell\nme where the block meeting's being held?\" Walton asked.\n\n\"Down the street and turn left. You a telefax man?\"\n\n\"Just an interested citizen,\" Walton said. \"Thanks for the directions.\"\n\nIt was easy to see where the block meeting was; Walton saw streams of\ndetermined-looking men and women entering a bulky old building just off\n382nd Street. He joined them and found himself carried along into the\nauditorium.\n\nNervously he found a seat. The auditorium was an old one, predominantly\ndark brown and cavernous, with row after row of hard wooden folding\nchairs. Someone was adjusting a microphone on stage. A sharp metallic\nwhine came over the public-address system.\n\n\"Testing. Testing, one two three....\"\n\n\"It's all right, Max!\" someone yelled from the rear. Walton didn't turn\naround to look.\n\nA low undercurrent of murmuring was audible. It was only 1815; the\nmeeting was not due to start for another fifteen minutes, but the hall\nwas nearly full, with more than a thousand of the local residents\nalready on hand.\n\nThe fifteen minutes passed slowly. Walton listened carefully to the\nconversations around him; no one was discussing the Venus situation.\nApparently his cloud of censorship had been effective. He had\ninstructed Percy to keep all word of the disaster from the public\nuntil the 2100 newsblares. By that time, the people would have been\nexposed to the indoctrinating kaleidowhirl program at 2000, and their\nreaction would be accordingly more temperate--he hoped.\n\nAlso, releasing the news early would have further complicated the\nsurvey Walton was trying to make by attending this public meeting.\nThe Index of Public Confusion increased factorially; one extra\nconsideration for discussion and Walton's task would be hopelessly\ndifficult.\n\nAt exactly 1830, a tall, middle-aged man stepped out on the stage. He\nseized the microphone as if it were a twig and said, \"Hello, folks.\nGlad to see you're all here tonight. This is an important meeting\nfor us all. In case some of you don't know me--and I do see some new\nfaces out there--I'm Dave Forman, president of the West 382nd Street\nAssociation. I also run a little law business on the side, just to help\npay the rent.\" (Giggles.)\n\n\"As usual in these meetings,\" Forman went on, \"we'll have a brief\npanel discussion, and then I'll throw the thing open to you folks for\nfloor discussion. The panelists tonight are people you all know--Sadie\nHargreave, Dominic Campobello, Rudi Steinfeld. Come on out here, folks.\"\n\nThe panelists appeared on the stage diffidently. Sadie Hargreave was\na short, stout, fierce-looking little woman; Campobello was chunky,\nbalding, Steinfeld tall and ascetic. Walton was astonished that there\nshould be such camaraderie here. Was it all synthetic? It didn't seem\nthat way.\n\nHe had always remained aloof, never mingling with his neighbors in\nthe gigantic project where he lived, never suspecting the existence\nof community life on this scale. But, somehow, community life had\nsprung up in this most Gargantuan of cities. Organizations within each\nproject, within each block perhaps, had arisen, converting New York\ninto an interlocking series of small towns. _I ought to investigate\nthe grass roots more often_, Walton thought. _Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid\nhaving a night on the town._\n\n\"Hello, folks,\" Sadie Hargreave said aggressively. \"I'm glad I can\ntalk to you tonight. Gosh, I want to speak out. I think it's crazy to\nlet these thing-men from outer space push us around. I for one feel we\nought to take strong action against that space world.\"\n\nCries of \"Yeah! Yeah! Go to it, Sadie!\" rose from the audience.\n\nSkillfully she presented three inflammatory arguments in favor of\nwar with Dirna, backing up each with a referent of high emotional\nconnotation. Walton watched her performance with growing admiration.\nThe woman was a born public relations technician. It was too bad she\nwas on the other side of the fence.\n\nHe saw the effect she had: people were nodding in agreement, grimacing\nvehemently, muttering to themselves. The mood of the meeting, he\ngathered, was overwhelmingly in favor of war if Dirna did not yield New\nEarth.\n\nDominic Campobello began his address by inviting all and sundry to his\nbarber shop; this was greeted with laughter. Then he launched into a\ndiscourse on Popeek as an enemy of mankind. A few catcalls, Walton\nnoted, but again chiefly approval. Campobello seemed sincere.\n\nThe third man, Rudi Steinfeld, was a local music teacher. He, too,\nspoke out against Popeek, though in a restrained, dryly intellectual\nmanner. People began yawning. Steinfeld cut his speech short.\n\nIt was now 1900. In one hour Percy's kaleidowhirl program would be\nscreened.\n\nWalton stayed at the block meeting until 1930, listening to citizen\nafter citizen rise and heap curses upon Popeek, Dirna, or Walton,\ndepending on where his particular ire lay. At 1930 Walton rose and left\nthe hall.\n\nHe phoned Percy. \"I'm on West 382nd Street. Just attended a block\nmeeting. I'd say the prevailing sentiment runs about ninety percent\nagin us. We don't have the people backing our program any more, Lee.\"\n\n\"We never did. But I think we'll nail 'em now. The kaleidowhirl's ready\nto go, and it's a honey. And I think _Citizen_ will sell 'em too! We're\non our way, Roy.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" Walton said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was unable to bring himself to watch Percy's program, even though he\nreached his room in time that night. He knew there could be no harm in\nwatching--at least not for him--but the idea of voluntarily submitting\nhis mind to external tampering was too repugnant to accept.\n\nInstead he spent the hour dictating a report on the block meeting, for\nbenefit of his pollster staff. When he was done with that, he turned\nto the 2100 edition of _Citizen_, which came clicking from the telefax\nslot right on schedule.\n\nHe had to look hard for the Venus story. Finally he found it tucked\naway at the bottom of the sheet.\n\n    _ACCIDENT ON VENUS_\n\n    _A big blowup took place on the planet Venus earlier today. Sky-men\n    who watched the popoff say it was caused by an atomic explosion in\n    the planet's atmosphere._\n\n    _Meanwhile, attempts are being made to reach the team of Earth\n    engineers working on Venus. No word from them yet. They may be\n    dead._\n\nWalton chuckled. _They may be dead_, indeed! By now Lang and his team,\nand the rescue mission as well, lay dead under showers of radioactive\nformaldehyde, and Venus had been turned into a blazing hell ten times\nless livable than it had been before.\n\nPercy had mishandled the news superbly. For one thing, he had\ncarefully neglected to link Lang with Popeek in any way. That was good\nconnotative thinking. It would be senseless to identify Popeek in the\npublic mind with disasters or fiascos of any kind.\n\nFor another, the skimpy insignificance of the piece implied that it\nhad been some natural phenomenon that sent Venus up in flames, not the\nfumbling attempts of the terraformers. Good handling there, too.\n\nWalton felt cheerful. He slept soundly, knowing that the public\nconsciousness was being properly shaped.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBy 0900, when he arrived at his office, the pollsters had reported a\nten percent swing in public opinion, in the direction of Popeek and\nWalton. At 1000, _Citizen_ hit the slots with an extra announcing that\nprospects for peaceful occupation of New Earth looked excellent. The\neditorial praised Walton. The letters-to-the-editor column, carefully\nfabricated by Lee Percy, showed a definite upswing of opinion.\n\nThe trend continued, and it was contagious. By 1100, when Walton\nleft the Cullen Building and caught a jetcopter for United Nations\nHeadquarters, the pro-Popeek trend in public opinion was almost\noverwhelming.\n\nThe copter put down before the gleaming green-glass facade of UN\nHeadquarters; Walton handed the man a bill and went inside, where a\ntense-faced Ludwig was waiting for him.\n\n\"They started early,\" Ludwig said. \"It's been going on since 1000.\"\n\n\"How do things look?\"\n\n\"I'm puzzled, Roy. Couple of die-hards are screaming for your scalp,\nbut you're getting help from unexpected quarters. Old Mogens Snorreson\nof Denmark suddenly got up and said it was necessary for the safety\nof mankind that we give you a permanent appointment as director of\nPopeek.\"\n\n\"_Snorreson?_ But hasn't he been the one who wanted me bounced?\"\n\nLudwig nodded. \"That's what I mean. The climate is changing, definitely\nchanging. Ride the crest, Roy. The way things look now, you may end up\nbeing swept into office for life.\"\n\nThey entered the giant Assembly hall. At the dais, a black-faced man\nwith bright teeth was speaking.\n\n\"Who's that?\" Walton whispered.\n\n\"Malcolm Nbono, the delegate from Ghana. He regards you as a sort of\nsaint for our times.\"\n\nWalton slipped into a seat in the gallery and said, \"Let's listen from\nhere before we go down below. I want to catch my breath.\"\n\nThe young man from Ghana was saying, \"... Crisis points are common\nto humanity. Many years ago, when my people came from their colonial\nstatus and achieved independence, we learned that painstaking\nnegotiations and peaceful approaches are infinitely more efficacious\nthan frontal attack by violent means. In my eyes, Roy Walton is an\noutstanding exponent of this philosophy. I urge his election as\ndirector of the Bureau of Population Equalization.\"\n\nA heavy-bearded, ponderous man to Nbono's right shouted \"Bravo!\" at\nthat point, and added several thick Scandinavian expletives.\n\n\"That's good old Mogens. The Dane really is on your side this morning,\"\nLudwig said.\n\n\"Must have been watching the kaleidowhirl last night,\" Walton murmured.\n\nThe delegate from Ghana concluded with a brief tremolo cadenza praising\nWalton. Walton's eyes were a little moist; he hadn't realized he was a\nsaint. Nbono tacked on an abrupt coda and sat down.\n\n\"All right,\" Walton said. \"Let's go down there.\"\n\nThey made a grand entrance. Ludwig took his seat behind the neon\n_United States_ sign, and Walton slid into the unoccupied seat to\nLudwig's right. A definite stir of interest was noticeable.\n\nThe secretary-general was presiding--beady-eyed Lars Magnusson of\nSweden. \"I see Mr. Walton of Popeek has arrived,\" he commented. \"By a\nresolution passed unanimously yesterday, we have invited Mr. Walton\nthis morning to address us briefly. Mr. Walton, would you care to speak\nnow?\"\n\n\"Thank you very much,\" Walton said. He rose.\n\nThe delegates were staring at him with great interest ... and,\nsomewhere behind them, obscured by the bright lights of the cameras,\nthere were, he sensed, a vast multitude of onlookers peering at him\nfrom the galleries.\n\nOnlookers who had seen Percy's kaleidowhirl last night, evidently. A\nthunderous wave of applause swept down on him. _This is too easy_, he\nthought. _That kaleidowhirl program seems to have hypnotized everybody._\n\nHe moistened his lips.\n\n\"Mr. Secretary-General, members of the Assembly, friends: I'm very\ngrateful for this chance to come before you on my own behalf. It's\nmy understanding that you are to choose a permanent successor to Mr.\nFitzMaugham today. I offer myself as a candidate for that post.\"\n\nHe had planned a long, impassioned, semantically loaded speech to sway\nthem, but the happenings thus far this morning convinced him it was\nunnecessary. The kaleidowhirl had done the work for him.\n\n\"My qualifications for the post should be apparent to all. I worked\nwith the late Director FitzMaugham during the formative days of\nPopeek. Upon his death I succeeded to his post and have efficiently\nmaintained the operation of the Bureau during the eight days since his\nassassination.\n\n\"There are special circumstances which dictate my continuation\nin office. Perhaps you know of the failure of our terraforming\nexperiments--the destruction of our outpost on Venus, and the permanent\ndamage done to that planet. The failure of this project makes it\nimperative that we move outward to the stars to relieve our population\ncrisis.\"\n\nHe took a deep breath. \"In exactly four hours,\" he said, \"a\nrepresentative of an alien race will land on Earth to confer with\nthe director of Popeek. I cannot stress too greatly the importance\nof maintaining a continuity of thought and action within our Bureau.\nBluntly, it is essential that _I_ be the one who deals with this alien.\nI ask for your support. Thank you.\"\n\nHe took his seat again. Ludwig was staring at him, aghast.\n\n\"Roy! What kind of a speech was that? You can't just _demand_ the job!\nYou've got to give reasons! You have to--\"\n\n\"Hush,\" Walton said. \"Don't worry about it. Were you watching the\nkaleidowhirls last night?\"\n\n\"Me? Of course not!\"\n\nWalton grinned. \"_They_ were,\" he said, gesturing at the other\ndelegates. \"I'm not worried.\"\n\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\n\nWalton left the Assembly meeting about 1215, pleading urgent Popeek\nbusiness. The voting began at 1300, and half an hour later the result\nwas officially released.\n\nThe 1400 _Citizen_ was the first to carry the report.\n\n    _WALTON ELECTED POPEEK HEAD_\n\n    _The General Assembly of the United Nations gave Roy Walton a\n    healthy vote of confidence today. By a 95-0 vote, three abstaining,\n    he was picked to succeed the late D. F. FitzMaugham as Popeek czar.\n    He has held the post on a temporary basis for the past eight days._\n\nWalton rang up Percy. \"Who wrote that _Citizen_ piece on me?\" he asked.\n\n\"I did, chief. Why?\"\n\n\"Nicely done, but not enough sock. Get all those three-syllable words\nout of it by the next edition. Get back to the old _Citizen_ style of\njazzy writing.\"\n\n\"We thought we'd brush it up a little now that you're in,\" Percy said.\n\n\"No. That's dangerous. Keep to the old style, but revamp the content.\nWe're rolling along, now. What's new from the pollsters?\"\n\n\"Fifty percent swing to Popeek. You're the most popular man in the\ncountry, as of noon. Churches are offering up prayers for you. There's\na move afoot to make you President of the United States in place of old\nLanson.\"\n\n\"Let Lanson keep his job,\" Walton chuckled. \"I'm not looking for any\nfigurehead jobs. I'm too young. When's the next _Citizen_ due?\"\n\n\"At 1500. We're keeping up hourly editions until the crisis is over.\"\n\nWalton thought for a moment. \"I think 1500's too early. The Dirnan\narrives in Nairobi at 1530 our time. I want a big splash in the 1600\nedition--but not a word before then!\"\n\n\"I'm with you,\" Percy said, and signed off.\n\nA moment later the annunciator said, \"There's a closed-circuit call for\nyou from Batavia, sir.\"\n\n\"From where?\"\n\n\"Batavia. Java.\"\n\n\"Let's have it,\" Walton said.\n\nA fleshy face filled the screen, the face of a man who had lived a soft\nlife in a moist climate. A rumbling voice said, \"You are Walton.\"\n\n\"I am Walton.\"\n\n\"I am Gaetano di Cassio. Pleased of making the acquaintance, Signor\nDirector Walton. I own rubber plantation in the area here.\"\n\nWalton's mind immediately clocked off the top name on the list of\nlanded proprietors Lassen had prepared for him:\n\n_di Cassio, Gaetano. 57. Holdings estimated at better than a billion\nand a quarter. Born Genoa 2175, settled in Amsterdam 2199. Purchased\nlarge Java holding 2211._\n\n\"What can I do for you, Mr. di Cassio?\"\n\nThe rubber magnate looked ill; his fleshy face was beaded with globules\nof sweat. \"Your brother,\" he grunted heavily. \"Your brother worked for\nme. I sent him to see you yesterday. He has not come back.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" Walton shrugged. \"There's a famous phrase I could use at this\npoint. I won't.\"\n\n\"Make no flippancies,\" di Cassio said heavily. \"Where is he?\"\n\nWalton said, \"In jail. Attempted coercion of a public official.\" He\nrealized di Cassio was twice as nervous and tense as he was.\n\n\"You have jailed him,\" di Cassio repeated flatly. \"Ah, I see. Jail.\"\nThe audio pickup brought in the sound of stertorous breathing. \"Will\nyou not free him?\" di Cassio asked.\n\n\"I will not.\"\n\n\"Did he not tell you what would happen if he would not be granted his\nrequest?\"\n\n\"He told me,\" Walton said. \"Well?\"\n\nThe fat man looked sick. Walton saw that the bluff was going to be\nunsuccessful; that the conspirators would not dare put Lamarre's drug\ninto open production. It had been a weapon without weight, and Walton\nhad not let himself be cowed by it.\n\n\"Well?\" Walton repeated inflexibly.\n\n\"You trouble me sorely,\" said di Cassio. \"You give my heart pain, Mr.\nWalton. Steps will have to be taken.\"\n\n\"The Lamarre immortality serum--\"\n\nThe face on the screen turned a leaden gray. \"The serum,\" di Cassio\nsaid, \"is not entered into this talking.\"\n\n\"Oh, no? My brother Fred made a few remarks--\"\n\n\"Serum _non esiste_!\"\n\nWalton smiled calmly. \"A nonexistent serum,\" he said, \"has,\nunfortunately, nonexistent leverage against me. You don't scare me, di\nCassio. I've outbluffed you. Go take a walk around your plantation.\nWhile you still have it, that is.\"\n\n\"Steps will be taken,\" di Cassio said. But his malevolence was hollow.\nWalton laughed and broke contact.\n\nHe drew Lassen's list from his desk and inscribed a brief memo to Olaf\nEglin on it. These were the hundred biggest estates in the world.\nWithin a week, there would be equalized Japanese living on all of them.\n\nHe called Martinez of security. \"I've ordered my brother Fred remanded\nto your care,\" he said.\n\n\"I know.\" The security man sounded peeved. \"We can't hold a man\nindefinitely, not even on your say-so, Director Walton.\"\n\n\"The charge is conspiracy,\" Walton said. \"Conspiracy against the\nsuccessful operation of Popeek. I'll have a list of the ringleaders on\nyour desk in half an hour. I want them rounded up, given a thorough\npsyching, and jailed.\"\n\n\"There are times,\" Martinez said slowly, \"when I suspect you exceed\nyour powers, Director Walton. But send me the list and I'll have the\narrests made.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe afternoon crawled. Walton proceeded with routine work on half\na dozen fronts, held screened conferences with each of his section\nchiefs, read reports augmenting what he already knew of the Venus\ndisaster, and gobbled a few benzolurethrin tranquilizers.\n\nHe called Keeler and learned that no sign of Lamarre had come to\nlight yet. From Percy he discovered that _Citizen_ had added two\nhundred thousand subscribers overnight. The 1500 edition had a lengthy\neditorial praising Walton, and some letters that Percy swore were\ngenuine, doing the same.\n\nAt 1515 Olaf Eglin called to announce that the big estates were in the\nprocess of being dismembered. \"You'll be able to hear the howls from\nhere to Batavia when we get going,\" Eglin warned.\n\n\"We have to be tough,\" Walton told him firmly.\n\nAt 1517 he devoted a few minutes to a scientific paper that proposed\nterraforming Pluto by establishing synthetic hydrogen-fusion suns\non the icy planet. Walton skimmed through the specifications, which\ninvolved passing a current of several million amperes through a tube\ncontaining a mixture of tritium and deuterium. The general idea, he\ngathered, was to create electromagnetic forces of near-solar intensity;\na pulsed-reaction engine would supply a hundred megawatts of power\ncontinuously at 10,000,000 degrees centigrade.\n\n_Has possibilities_, Walton noted, and forwarded the plan on to Eglin.\nIt sounded plausible enough, but Walton was personally skeptical of\nundertaking any more terraforming experiments after the Venus fiasco.\nThere were, after all, limits to the public relations miracles Lee\nPercy could create.\n\nAt 1535 the annunciator chimed again. \"Call from Nairobi, Africa, Mr.\nWalton.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nMcLeod appeared on the screen.\n\n\"We're here,\" he said. \"Arrived safely half a microsecond ago, and\nall's well.\"\n\n\"How about the alien?\"\n\n\"We have him in a specially constructed cabin. Breathes hydrogen and\nammonia, you know. He's very anxious to see you. When can you come?\"\n\nWalton thought for a moment. \"I guess there's no way of transporting\nhim here, is there?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't advise it. The Dirnans are very sensitive about traveling\nin such a low gravitational field. Makes their stomachs queasy, you\nknow. Do you think you could come out here?\"\n\n\"When's the earliest?\"\n\n\"Oh--half an hour?\" McLeod suggested.\n\n\"I'm on my way,\" said Walton.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sprawling metropolis of Nairobi, capital of the Republic of Kenya,\nlay at the foot of the Kikuyu Hills, and magnificent Mount Kilimanjaro\ntowered above it. Four million people inhabited Nairobi, finest of the\nmany fine cities along Africa's western coast. Africa's Negro republics\nhad built soundly and well after achieving their liberation from\ncolonial status.\n\nThe city was calm as Walton's special jet decelerated for landing\nat the vast Nairobi airport. He had left at 1547 New York time; the\ntransatlantic trip had taken two hours and some minutes, and there was\nan eight-hour time zone differential between Kenya and New York. It\nwas now 0313 in Nairobi; the early-morning rain was falling right on\nschedule as the jet taxied to a halt.\n\nMcLeod was there to meet him. \"The ship's in the hills, five miles out\nof town. There's a copter waiting for you here.\"\n\nMoments after leaving the jetliner, Walton was shepherded aboard the\n'copter. Rotors whirred; the 'copter rose perpendicularly until it hung\njust above the cloud-seeders at 13,000 feet, then fired its jets and\nstreaked toward the hills.\n\nIt was not raining when they landed; according to McLeod, the night\nrain was scheduled for 0200 in this sector, and the seeders had already\nbeen here and moved on to bring rain to the city proper. A groundcar\nwaited for them at the airstrip in the hills. McLeod drove, handling\nthe turboelectric job with skill.\n\n\"There's the ship,\" he said proudly, pointing.\n\nWalton felt a sudden throat lump.\n\nThe ship stood on its tail in the midst of a wide, flat swath of\njet-blackened concrete. It was at least five hundred feet high, a\ntowering pale needle shimmering brightly in the moonlight. Wideswept\ntailjets supported it like arching buttresses. Men moved busily about\nin the floodlighted area at its base.\n\nMcLeod drove up to the ship and around it. The flawless symmetry of the\nforeside was not duplicated behind; there, a spidery catwalk ran some\neighty feet up the side of the ship to a gaping lock, and by its side a\ncrude elevator shaft rose to the same hatch.\n\nMcLeod drew efficient salutes from the men as he left the car; Walton,\nonly puzzled glares.\n\n\"We'd better take the elevator,\" McLeod said. \"The men are working on\nthe catwalk.\"\n\nSilently they rode up into the ship. They stepped through the open\nairlock into a paneled lounge, then into narrow companionways. McLeod\npaused and pressed down a stud in an alcove along the way.\n\n\"I'm back,\" he announced. \"Tell Thogran Klayrn that I've brought\nWalton. Find out whether he'll come out to talk to him.\"\n\n\"I thought he had to breathe special atmosphere,\" Walton said. \"How can\nhe come out?\"\n\n\"They've got breathing masks. Usually they don't like to use them.\"\nMcLeod listened at the earpiece for a moment, then nodded. To Walton\nhe said, \"The alien will see you in the lounge.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWalton had barely time to fortify himself with a slug of filtered rum\nwhen a crewman appeared at the entrance to the lounge and declared\nostentatiously, \"His Excellency, Thogran Klayrn of Dirna.\"\n\nThe alien entered.\n\nWalton had seen the photographs, and so he was partially prepared. But\nonly partially.\n\nThe photos had not given him any idea of size. The alien stood eight\nfeet high, and gave an appearance of astonishing mass. It must have\nweighed four or five hundred pounds, but it stood on two thick legs\nbarely three feet long. Somewhere near the middle of the columnar\nbody, four sturdy arms jutted forth strangely. A neckless head topped\nthe ponderous creature--a head covered entirely with the transparent\nbreathing mask. One of the hands held a mechanical device of some sort;\nthe translating machine, Walton surmised.\n\nThe alien's hide was bright-green, and leathery in texture. A faint\npungent odor drifted through the room, as of an object long immersed in\nammonia.\n\n\"I am Thogran Klayrn,\" a booming voice said. \"Diplomasiarch of Dirna. I\nhave been sent to talk with Roy Walton. Are you Roy Walton?\"\n\n\"I am.\" Walton's voice sounded cold and dry to his own ears. He knew he\nwas too tense, pressing too hard. \"I'm very glad to meet you, Thogran\nKlayrn.\"\n\n\"Please sit. I do not. My body is not made that way.\"\n\nWalton sat. It made him feel uncomfortable to have to crane his neck\nupward at the alien, but that could not be helped. \"Did you have a\npleasant trip?\" Walton asked, temporizing desperately.\n\nA half-grunt came from Thogran Klayrn. \"Indeed it was so. But I do not\nindulge in little talk. A problem we have, and it must be discussed.\"\n\n\"Agreed.\" Whatever a diplomasiarch might be on Dirna, it was _not_ a\ntypical diplomat. Walton was relieved that it would not be necessary to\nspend hours in formalities before they reached the main problem.\n\n\"A ship sent out by your people,\" the alien said, \"invaded our system\nsome time ago. In command was your Colonel McLeod, whom I have come to\nknow well. What was the purpose of this ship?\"\n\n\"To explore the worlds of the universe and to discover a planet where\nwe of Earth could settle. Our world is very overcrowded now.\"\n\n\"So I have been given to know. You have chosen Labura--or, in your\nterms, Procyon VIII--as your colony. Is this so?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Walton said. \"It's a perfect world for our purposes. But Colonel\nMcLeod has informed me that you object to our settling there.\"\n\n\"We do so object.\" The Dirnan's voice was cold. \"You are a young and\nactive race. We do not know what danger you may bring to us. To have\nyou as our neighbors--\"\n\n\"We could swear a treaty of eternal peace,\" Walton said.\n\n\"Words. Mere words.\"\n\n\"But don't you see that we can't even _land_ on that planet of yours!\nIt's too big, too heavy for us. What possible harm could we do?\"\n\n\"There are races,\" said the Dirnan heavily, \"which believe in violence\nas a sacred act. You have long-range missiles. How might we trust you?\"\n\nWalton squirmed; then sudden inspiration struck him. \"There's a planet\nin this system that's as suitable for your people as Labura is for\nours. I mean Jupiter. We could offer you colonial rights to Jupiter in\nexchange for the privilege of colonizing Labura!\"\n\nThe alien was silent for a moment. Considering? There was no way of\ntelling what emotions passed across that face. At length the alien\nsaid, \"Not satisfactory. Our people have long since reached stability\nof population. We have no need of colonies. It has been many thousands\nof your years since we have ventured into space.\"\n\nWalton felt chilled. _Many thousands of years!_ He realized he was up\nagainst a formidable life form.\n\n\"We have learned to stabilize births and deaths,\" the Dirnan went on\nsonorously. \"It is a fundamental law of the universe, and one that you\nEarthfolk must learn sooner or later. How you choose to do it is your\nown business. But we have no need of planets in your system, and we\nfear allowing you to enter ours. The matter is simple of statement,\ndifficult of resolution. But we are open to suggestions from you.\"\n\nWalton's mind blanked. Suggestions? What possible suggestion could he\nmake?\n\nHe gasped. \"We have something to offer,\" he said. \"It might be of value\nto a race that has achieved population stability. We would give it to\nyou in exchange for colonization rights.\"\n\n\"What is this commodity?\" the Dirnan asked.\n\n\"Immortality,\" Walton said.\n\n\n\n\nXIX\n\n\nHe returned to New York alone, later that night, too tired to sleep\nand too wide awake to relax. He felt like a poker player who had\ntriumphantly topped four kings with four aces, and now was fumbling\nin his hand trying to locate some of those aces for his skeptical\nopponents.\n\nThe alien had accepted his offer. That was the one solid fact he was\nable to cling to, on the lonely night ride back from Nairobi. The rest\nwas a quicksand of ifs and maybes.\n\n_If_ Lamarre could be found....\n\n_If_ the serum actually had any value....\n\n_If_ it was equally effective on Earthmen and Dirnans....\n\nWalton tried to dismiss the alternatives. He had made a desperately\nwild offer, and it had been accepted. New Earth was open for\ncolonization, _if_....\n\nThe world outside the jet was a dark blur. He had left Nairobi at 0518\nNairobi time; jetting back across the eight intervening time zones, he\nwould arrive in New York around midnight. Ultrarapid jet transit made\nsuch things possible; he would live twice through the early hours of\nJune nineteenth.\n\nNew York had a fifteen minute rain scheduled at 0100 that night. Walton\nreached the housing project where he lived just as the rain was turned\non. The night was otherwise a little muggy; he paused outside the main\nentrance, letting the drops fall on him. After a few minutes, feeling\nfaintly foolish and very tired, he went inside, shook himself dry, and\nwent to bed. He did not sleep.\n\nFour caffeine tablets helped him get off to a running start in the\nmorning. He arrived at the Cullen Building early, about 0835, and spent\nsome time bringing his private journal up to date, explaining in detail\nthe burden of his interview with the alien ambassador. Some day, Walton\nthought, a historian of the future would discover his journal and find\nthat for a short period in 2232 a man named Roy Walton had acted as\nabsolute dictator of humanity. The odd thing, Walton reflected, was\nthat he had absolutely no power drive: he had been pitchforked into the\nrole, and each of his successive extra-legal steps had been taken quite\ngenuinely in the name of humanity.\n\nRationalization? Perhaps. But a necessary one.\n\nAt 0900 Walton took a deep breath and called Keeler of security. The\nsecurity man smiled oddly and said, \"I was just about to call you, sir.\nWe have some news, at last.\"\n\n\"News? What?\"\n\n\"Lamarre. We found his body this morning, just about an hour ago.\nMurdered. It turned up in Marseilles, pretty badly decomposed, but we\nran a full check and the retinal's absolutely Lamarre's.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Walton said leadenly. His head swam. \"Definitely Lamarre,\" he\nrepeated. \"Thanks, Keeler. Fine work. Fine.\"\n\n\"Something wrong, sir? You look--\"\n\n\"I'm very tired,\" Walton said. \"That's all. Tired. Thanks, Keeler.\"\n\n\"You called me about something, sir,\" Keeler reminded him gently.\n\n\"Oh, I was calling about Lamarre. I guess there's no point in--thanks,\nKeeler.\" He broke the contact.\n\nFor the first time Walton felt total despair, and, out of despair,\ncame a sort of deathlike calmness. With Lamarre dead, his only hope of\nobtaining the serum was to free Fred and wangle the notes from him. But\nFred's price for the notes would be Walton's job. Full circle, and a\ndead end.\n\nPerhaps Fred could be induced to reveal the whereabouts of the notes.\nIt wasn't likely, but it was possible. And if not? Walton shrugged.\nA man could do only so much. Terraforming had proved a failure,\nequalization was a stopgap of limited value, and the one extrasolar\nplanet worth colonizing was held by aliens. Dead end.\n\n_I tried_, Walton thought. _Now let someone else try._\n\nHe shook his head, trying to clear the fog of negation that suddenly\nsurrounded him. His thinking was all wrong; he had to keep trying, had\nto investigate every possible avenue before giving up.\n\nHis fingers hovered lightly over a benzolurethrin tablet, then drew\nback. Stiffly he rose from his chair and switched on the annunciator.\n\n\"I'm leaving the office for a while,\" he said hoarsely. \"Send all calls\nto Mr. Eglin.\"\n\nHe had to see Fred.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSecurity Keep was a big, blocky building beyond the city limits proper,\na windowless tower near Nyack, New York. Walton's private jetcopter\ndropped noiselessly to the landing stage on the wide parapet of the\nbuilding. He contemplated its dull-bronze metallic exterior for a\nmoment.\n\n\"Should I wait here?\" the pilot asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Walton said. With accession to the permanent directorship he\nrated a private ship and a live pilot. \"I won't be here long.\"\n\nHe left the landing stage and stepped within an indicated screener\nfield. There was a long pause. The air up here, Walton thought, is\nfresh and clean, not like city air.\n\nA voice said, \"What is your business here?\"\n\n\"I'm Walton, director of Popeek. I have an appointment with Security\nHead Martinez.\"\n\n\"Wait a moment, Director Walton.\"\n\nNone of the obsequious _sirring_ and _pleasing_ Walton had grown\naccustomed to. In its way, the bluntness of address was as refreshing\nas the unpolluted air.\n\nWalton's keen ears detected a gentle electronic whirr; he was being\nthoroughly scanned. After a moment the metal door before him rose\nsilently into a hidden slot, and he found himself facing an inner door\nof burnished copper.\n\nA screen was set in the inner door.\n\nMartinez' face confronted him.\n\n\"Good morning, Director Walton. You're here for our interview?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThe inner door closed. This time, two chunky atomic cannons came\nbarreling down to face him snout first. Walton flinched involuntarily,\nbut a smiling Martinez stepped before them and greeted him. \"Well, why\nare you here?\"\n\n\"To see a prisoner of yours. My brother, Fred.\"\n\nMartinez frowned and passed a delicate hand through his rumpled hair.\n\"Seeing prisoners is positively forbidden, Mr. Walton. Seeing them in\nperson, that is. I could arrange a closed-circuit video screening for\nyou.\"\n\n\"Forbidden? But the man's here on my word alone. I--\"\n\n\"Your powers, Mr. Walton, are still somewhat less than infinite. This\nis one rule we never have relaxed, and never will. The prisoners in the\nKeep are under constant security surveillance, and your presence in the\ncell block would undermine our entire system. Will video do?\"\n\n\"I guess it'll have to,\" Walton said. He was not of a mind to argue now.\n\n\"Come with me, then,\" said Martinez.\n\nThe little man led him down a dim corridor into a side room, one entire\nwall of which was an unlit video screen. \"You'll have total privacy\nin here,\" Martinez assured him. He did things to a dial set in the\nright-hand wall, and murmured a few words. The screen began to glow.\n\n\"You can call me when you're through,\" Martinez said. He seemed to\nglide out of the room, leaving Walton alone with Fred.\n\nThe huge screen was like a window directly into Fred's cell. Walton met\nhis brother's bitter gaze head on.\n\nFred looked demonic. His eyes were ringed by black shadows; his hair\nwas uncombed, his heavy-featured face unwashed. He said, \"Welcome to my\npalatial abode, dearest brother.\"\n\n\"Fred, don't make it hard for me. I came here to try to clarify things.\nI didn't _want_ to stick you away here. I _had_ to.\"\n\nFred smiled balefully. \"You don't need to apologize. It was entirely\nmy fault. I underestimated you; I didn't realize you had changed. I\nthought you were the same old soft-hearted dope I grew up with. You\naren't.\"\n\n\"Possibly.\" Walton wished he had taken that benzolurethrin after all.\nEvery nerve in his body seemed to be jumping. He said, \"I found out\ntoday that Lamarre's dead.\"\n\n\"So?\"\n\n\"So there's no possible way for Popeek to obtain the immortality serum\nexcept through you. Fred, I need that serum. I've promised it to the\nalien in exchange for colonization rights on Procyon VIII.\"\n\n\"A neat little package deal,\" Fred said harshly. \"_Quid pro quo._ Well,\nI hate to spoil it, but I'm not going to tell where the _quo_ lies\nhidden. You're not getting that serum out of me.\"\n\n\"I can have you mind blasted,\" Walton said. \"They'll pick your mind\napart and strip it away layer by layer until they find what they want.\nThere won't be much of _you_ left by then, but we'll have the serum.\"\n\n\"No go. Not even you can swing that deal,\" Fred said. \"You can't get a\nmind-pick permit on your lonesome: you need the President's okay. It\ntakes at least a day to go through channels--half a day, if you pull\nrank. And by that time, Roy, I'll be out of here.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You heard me clear enough. _Out._ Seems you're holding me here on\npretty tenuous grounds. Habeas corpus hasn't been suspended yet, Roy,\nand Popeek isn't big enough to do it. I've got a writ. I'll be sprung\nat 1500 today.\"\n\n\"I'll have you back in by 1530,\" Walton said angrily. \"We're picking up\ndi Cassio and that whole bunch. That'll be sufficient grounds to quash\nyour habeas corpus.\"\n\n\"Ah! Maybe so,\" Fred said. \"But I'll be out of here for half an hour.\nThat's long enough to let the world know how you exercised an illegal\nspecial privilege and spared Philip Prior from Happysleep. Wiggle out\nof that one, then.\"\n\nWalton began to sweat.\n\nFred had him neatly nailed this time.\n\nSomeone in security evidently had let him sneak his plea out of the\nKeep. Martinez? Well, it didn't matter. By 1500 Fred would be free,\nand the long-suppressed Prior incident would be smeared all over the\ntelefax system. That would finish Walton; affairs were at too delicate\nan impasse for him to risk having to defend himself now. Fred might not\nbe able to save himself, but he could certainly topple his brother.\n\nThere was no possible way to get a mind-pick request through before\n1500; President Lanson himself would have to sign the authorization,\nand the old dodderer would take his time about it.\n\nMind picking was out, but there was still one weapon left to the head\nof Popeek, if he cared to use it. Walton moistened his lips.\n\n\"It sounds very neat,\" he said. \"I'll ask you one more time: will you\nyield Lamarre's serum to me for use in my negotiations with the Dirnan?\"\n\n\"Are you kidding? No!\" Fred said positively. \"Not to save your life or\nmine. I've got you exactly where I want you, Roy. Where I've wanted you\nall my life. And you can't wriggle out of it.\"\n\n\"I think you've underestimated me again,\" Walton said in a quiet voice.\n\"And for the last time.\"\n\nHe stood up and opened the door of the room. A gray-clad security man\nhovered outside.\n\n\"Will you tell Mr. Martinez I'm ready to leave?\" Walton said.\n\nThe jetcopter pilot was dozing when Walton reached the landing stage.\nWalton woke him and said, \"Let's get back to the Cullen Building, fast.\"\n\nThe trip took about ten minutes. Walton entered his office, signaling\nhis return but indicating he wanted no calls just yet. Carefully,\nthoughtfully, he arranged the various strands of circumstance in his\nmind, building them into a symmetrical structure.\n\nDi Cassio and the other conspirators would be rounded up by nightfall,\ncertainly. But no time element operated there; Walton knew he could\nget mind-pick authorizations in a day or so, and go through one after\nanother of them until the whereabouts of Lamarre's formula turned up.\nIt was brutal, but necessary.\n\nFred was a different problem. Unless Walton prevented it, he'd be freed\non his writ within hours--and when he revealed the Prior incident, it\nwould smash Walton's whole fragile construct to flinders.\n\nHe couldn't fight habeas corpus. But the director of Popeek did have\none weapon that legally superseded all others. Fred had gambled on his\nbrother's softness, and Fred had lost.\n\nWalton reached for his voicewrite and, in a calm, controlled voice,\nbegan to dictate an order for the immediate removal of Frederic Walton\nfrom Security Keep, and for his prompt transference to the Euthanasia\nClinic on grounds of criminal insanity.\n\n\n\n\nXX\n\n\nEven after that--for which he felt no guilt, only relief--Walton felt\noppressive foreboding hanging over him. Martinez phoned, late that day,\nto inform him that the hundred landowners had been duly corralled and\nwere being held in the lower reaches of Security Keep.\n\n\"They're yelling and squalling,\" Martinez said, \"and they'll have\nplenty of high-power legal authority down here soon enough. You'd\nbetter have a case against them.\"\n\n\"I'm obtaining an authorization to mind blast the one named di Cassio.\nHe's the ringleader, I think.\" Walton paused for a moment, then asked,\n\"Did a Popeek copter arrive to pick up Frederic Walton?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Martinez said. \"At 1406. A lawyer showed up here waving a writ,\na little while later, but naturally we had no further jurisdiction.\"\nThe security man's eyes were cold and accusing, but Walton did not\nflinch.\n\n\"1406?\" he repeated. \"All right, Martinez. Thanks for your cooperation.\"\n\nHe blanked the screen. He was moving coolly, crisply now. In order to\nget a mind-pick authorization, he would have to see President Lanson\npersonally. Very well; he would see President Lanson.\n\nThe shrunken old man in the White House was openly deferential to\nthe Popeek head. Walton stated his case quickly, bluntly. Lanson's\nwatery, mild eyes blinked a few times at the many complexities of the\nsituation. He rocked uneasily up and down.\n\nFinally he said, \"This mind picking--it's absolutely necessary?\"\n\n\"Absolutely. We must know where that serum is hidden.\"\n\nLanson sighed heavily. \"I'll authorize it,\" he said. He looked beaten.\n\nWashington to New York was a matter of some few minutes. The precious\nauthorization in his hands, Walton spoke to di Cassio via the screener\nsetup at Security Keep, informed him of what was going to be done with\nhim. Then, despite the fat man's hysterical protests, he turned the\nauthorization over to Martinez with instructions to proceed with the\nmind pick.\n\nIt took fifty-eight minutes. Walton waited in a bare, austere office\nsomewhere in the Keep while the mind-picking technicians peeled away\nthe cortex of di Cassio's mind. By now Walton was past all ambivalence,\nall self-doubt. He thought of himself as a mere robot fulfilling a\npreset pattern of action.\n\nAt 1950 Martinez presented himself before Walton. The little security\nhead looked bleak.\n\n\"It's done. Di Cassio's been reduced to blubber and bone. I wouldn't\nwant to watch another mind picking too soon.\"\n\n\"You may have to,\" Walton said. \"If di Cassio wasn't the right one, I\nintend to go straight down the line on all hundred-odd of them. One of\nthem dealt with Fred. One of them must know where the Lamarre papers\nare.\"\n\nMartinez shook his head wearily. \"No. There won't need to be any more\nmind-picking. We got it all out of di Cassio. The transcript ought to\nbe along any moment.\"\n\nAs the security man spoke, an arrival bin in the office flashed and\na packet arrived. Walton broke impatiently for the bin, but Martinez\nwaved him away. \"This is my domain, Mr. Walton. Please be patient.\"\n\nWith infuriating slowness, Martinez opened the packet, removed some\nclosely-typed sheets, nodded over them. He handed them to Walton.\n\n\"Here. Read for yourself. Here's the record of the conversation between\nyour brother and di Cassio. I think it's what you're looking for.\"\n\nWalton accepted the sheets tensely and began to read:\n\n    Di Cassio: _You have a what?_\n\n    Fred Walton: _An immortality serum. Eternal life. You know. Some\n    Popeek scientist invented it, and I stole his notebook from my\n    brother's office. It's all here._\n\n    Di Cassio: _Buono! Excellent work. Excellent. Immortality, you say?_\n\n    Fred Walton: _Damned right. And it's the weapon we can use to pry\n    Roy out of office. All I have to do is tell him he'd better get out\n    of the way or we'll turn the serum loose on humanity, and he'll\n    move. He's an idealist--stars in his eyes and all that. He won't\n    dare resist._\n\n    Di Cassio: _This is marvelous. You will, of course, send the serum\n    formula to us for safe keeping?_\n\n    Fred Walton: _Like hell I will. I'm keeping those notes right where\n    they belong--inside my head. I've destroyed the notebooks and had\n    the scientist killed. The only one who knows the secret is yours\n    truly. This is just to prevent double-crossing on your part, di\n    Cassio. Not that I don't trust you, you understand._\n\n    Di Cassio: _Fred, my boy--_\n\n    Fred Walton: _None of that stuff. You gave me a free hand. Don't\n    try to interfere now._\n\nWalton let the transcript slip from his numb hands to the floor.\n\n\"My God,\" he said softly. \"My God!\"\n\nMartinez' bright eyes flicked from Walton to the scattered papers\non the floor. \"What's the trouble? You've got Fred in your custody,\nhaven't you?\"\n\n\"Didn't you read the order I sent you?\"\n\nMartinez chuckled hollowly. \"Well, yes--it was a Happysleep\nauthorization. But I thought it was just a way of avoiding that\nwrit ... I mean ... your own _brother_, man?\"\n\n\"That was no dodge,\" Walton said. \"That was a Happysleep order, and I\nmeant it. Really. Unless there was a slip-up, Fred went to the chamber\nfour hours ago. And,\" said Walton, \"he took the Lamarre formula along\nwith him.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAlone in his office in the night-shadowed Cullen Building, Walton\nstared at his own distorted reflection mirrored in the opaqued windows.\nOn his desk lay the slip of paper bearing the names of those who had\ngone to Happysleep in the 1500 gassing.\n\nFrederic Walton was the fourth name on the list. For once, there had\nbeen no slip-ups.\n\nWalton thought back over the events of the last nine days. One of his\nearliest realizations during that time had been that the head of Popeek\nheld powers of life and death over humanity.\n\nGodlike, he had assumed both responsibilities. He had granted life to\nPhilip Prior; that had been the start of this chain of events, and the\nfirst of his many mistakes. Now, he had given death to Frederic Walton,\nan act in itself justifiable, but in consequence the most massive of\nhis errors.\n\nAll his scheming had come to naught. Any help now would have to come\nfrom without.\n\nWearily, he snapped on the phone and asked for a connection to Nairobi.\nThe interstellar swap would have to be canceled; Walton was unable to\ndeliver the goods. Fred would have the final smirk yet.\n\nSome minutes later, he got through to McLeod.\n\n\"I'm glad you called,\" McLeod said immediately. \"I've been trying to\nreach you all day. The Dirnan's getting rather impatient; this low\ngravity is making him sick, and he wants to get going back to his home\nworld.\"\n\n\"Let me talk to him. He'll be able to leave right away.\"\n\nMcLeod nodded and vanished from the screen. The alien visage of Thogran\nKlayrn appeared.\n\n\"I have been waiting for you,\" the Dirnan said. \"You promised to call\nearlier today. You did not.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry about that,\" Walton told him. \"I was trying to locate the\npapers to turn over to you.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes. Has it been done?\"\n\n\"No,\" Walton said. \"The serum doesn't exist any more. The man who\ninvented it is dead, and so is the only other man who knew the formula.\"\n\nThere was a moment of startled silence. Then the Dirnan said, \"You\nassured me delivery of the information.\"\n\n\"I know. But it can't be delivered.\" Walton was silent a long while,\nbrooding. \"The deal's off. There was a mix-up and the man who had the\ndata was--was inadvertently executed today.\"\n\n\"_Today_, you say?\"\n\n\"Yes. It was an error on my part. A foolish blunder.\"\n\n\"That is irrelevant,\" the alien interrupted peevishly. \"Is the man's\nbody still intact?\"\n\n\"Why, yes,\" Walton said, taken off guard. He wondered what plan the\nalien had. \"It's in our morgue right now. But--\"\n\nThe alien turned away from the screen, and Walton heard him conferring\nwith someone beyond the field of vision. Then the Dirnan returned.\n\n\"There are techniques for recovering information from newly dead\npersons,\" Thogran Klayrn said. \"You have none of these on Earth?\"\n\n\"Recovering information?\" Walton stammered. \"No, we don't.\"\n\n\"These techniques exist. Have you such a device as an\nelectroencephalograph on Earth?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"Then it is still possible to extract the data from this dead man's\nbrain.\" The alien uttered a wistful wheeze. \"See that the body comes\nto no harm. I will be at your city shortly.\"\n\nFor a moment Walton did not understand.\n\nThen he thought, _Of course. It had to happen this way._\n\nHe realized the rent in the fabric had been bound up, his mistakes\nundone, his conscience granted a reprieve. He felt absurdly grateful.\nThat all his striving should have been ruined at the last moment would\nhave been intolerable. Now, all was made whole.\n\n\"Thanks,\" he said with sudden fervor. \"Thanks!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_14 May 2233...._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRoy Walton, director of the Bureau of Population Equalization, stood\nsweltering in the sun at Nairobi Spaceport, watching the smiling people\nfile past him into the towering, golden-hulled ship.\n\nA powerful-looking man holding a small child in his arms came up to him.\n\n\"Hello, Walton,\" he said in a majestic basso.\n\nWalton turned, startled. \"Prior!\" he exclaimed, after a moment's\nfumbling.\n\n\"And this is my son, Philip,\" said Prior. \"We'll both be going as\ncolonists. My wife's already aboard, but I just wanted to thank you--\"\n\nWalton looked at the happy, red-cheeked boy. \"There was a medical exam\nfor all volunteer colonists. How did you get the boy through _this_\ntime?\"\n\n\"Legitimately,\" Prior said, grinning. \"He's a perfectly healthy, normal\nboy. That potential TB condition was just that--potential. Philip got\nan A-one health clearance, so it's New Earth and the wide ranges for\nthe Prior family!\"\n\n\"I'm glad for you,\" Walton said absently. \"I wish I could go.\"\n\n\"Why can't you?\"\n\n\"Too much work here,\" Walton said. \"If you turn out any poetry up\nthere, I'd like to see it.\"\n\nPrior shook his head. \"I have a feeling I'll be too busy. Poetry's\nreally just a substitute for living, I'm getting to think. I'll be too\nbusy _living_ up there to write anything.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" said Walton. \"I suppose you're right. But you'd better move\nalong. That ship's due to blast pretty soon.\"\n\n\"Right. Thanks again for everything,\" Prior said, and he and the child\nmoved on.\n\nWalton watched them go. He thought back over the past year. _At least_,\nhe thought, _I made one right guess. The boy deserved to live._\n\nThe loading continued. One thousand colonists would go this first trip,\nand a thousand more the next day, and a thousand and a thousand more\nuntil a billion of Earth's multitudes were on the new world. There was\na great deal of paperwork involved in transporting a billion people\nthrough space. Walton's desk groaned with a backlog of work.\n\nHe glanced up. No stars were visible, of course, in the midday sky, but\nhe knew that New Earth was out there somewhere. And near it, Dirna.\n\n_Some day_, he thought, _we'll have learned to control our growth. And\nthat will be the day the Dirnans give us back our immortality formula._\n\nA warning siren sounded suddenly, and ship number one sprang up\nfrom Earth, hovered for a few instants on a red pillar of fire, and\nvanished. Director Walton looked blankly at the place where the ship\nhad been, and, after a moment, turned away. Plenty of work waited for\nhim back in New York.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Master of Life and Death, by Robert Silverberg\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MASTER OF LIFE AND DEATH ***\n\n***** This file should be named 50441-8.txt or 50441-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/0/4/4/50441/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
