KELLEY\nwho has a liking\nfor \"time agent\" tales._\n\n\n\n\n_THE DEFIANT AGENTS_\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nNo windows broke any of the four plain walls of the office; there was no\nfocus of outer-world sunlight on the desk there. Yet the five disks set\nout on its surface appeared to glow--perhaps the heat of the mischief\nthey could cause ... had caused ... blazed in them.\n\nBut fanciful imaginings did not cushion or veil cold, hard fact. Dr.\nGordon Ashe, one of the four men peering unhappily at the display, shook\nhis head slightly as if to free his mind of such cobwebs.\n\nHis neighbor to the right, Colonel Kelgarries, leaned forward to ask\nharshly: \"No chance of a mistake?\"\n\n\"You saw the detector.\" The thin gray string of a man behind the desk\nanswered with chill precision. \"No, no possible mistake. These five have\ndefinitely been snooped.\"\n\n\"And two choices among them,\" Ashe murmured. That was the important\npoint now.\n\n\"I thought these were under maximum security,\" Kelgarries challenged the\ngray man.\n\nFlorian Waldour's remote expression did not change. \"Every possible\nprecaution was in force. There was a sleeper--a hidden\nagent--planted----\"\n\n\"Who?\" Kelgarries demanded.\n\nAshe glanced around at his three companions--Kelgarries, colonel in\ncommand of one sector of Project Star, Florian Waldour, the security\nhead on the station, Dr. James Ruthven....\n\n\"Camdon!\" he said, hardly able to believe this answer to which logic had\nled him.\n\nWaldour nodded.\n\nFor the first time since he had known and worked with Kelgarries Ashe\nsaw him display open astonishment.\n\n\"Camdon? But he was sent us by--\" The colonel's eyes narrowed. \"He must\nhave been sent.... There were too many cross checks to fake that!\"\n\n\"Oh, he was sent, all right.\" For the first time there was a note of\nemotion in Waldour's voice. \"He was a sleeper, a very deep sleeper. They\nmust have planted him a full twenty-five or thirty years ago. He's been\njust what he claimed to be as long as that.\"\n\n\"Well, he certainly was worth their time and trouble, wasn't he?\" James\nRuthven's voice was a growling rumble. He sucked in thick lips,\ncontinuing to stare at the disks. \"How long ago were these snooped?\"\n\nAshe's thoughts turned swiftly from the enormity of the betrayal to that\nimportant point. The time element--that was the primary concern now that\nthe damage was done, and they knew it.\n\n\"That's one thing we don't know.\" Waldour's reply came slowly as if he\nhated the admission.\n\n\"We'll be safer, then, if we presume the very earliest period.\"\nRuthven's statement was as ruthless in its implications as the shock\nthey had had when Waldour announced the disaster.\n\n\"Eighteen months ago?\" Ashe protested.\n\nBut Ruthven was nodding. \"Camdon was in on this from the very first.\nWe've had the tapes in and out for study all that time, and the new\ndetector against snooping was not put in service until two weeks ago.\nThis case came up on the first checking round, didn't it?\" he asked\nWaldour.\n\n\"First check,\" the security man agreed. \"Camdon left the base six days\nago. But he has been in and out on his liaison duties from the first.\"\n\n\"He had to go through those search points every time,\" Kelgarries\nprotested. \"Thought nothing could get through those.\" The colonel\nbrightened. \"Maybe he got his snooper films and then couldn't take them\noff base. Have his quarters been turned out?\"\n\nWaldour's lips lifted in a grimace of exasperation. \"Please, Colonel,\"\nhe said wearily, \"this is not a kindergarten exercise. In confirmation\nof his success, listen....\" He touched a button on his desk and out of\nthe air came the emotionless chant of a newscaster.\n\n\"Fears for the safety of Lassiter Camdon, space expediter for the\nWestern Conference Space Council, have been confirmed by the discovery\nof burned wreckage in the mountains. Mr. Camdon was returning from a\nmission to the Star Laboratory when his plane lost contact with Ragnor\nField. Reports of a storm in that vicinity immediately raised concern--\"\nWaldour snapped off the voice.\n\n\"True--or a cover for his escape?\" Kelgarries wondered aloud.\n\n\"Could be either. They may have deliberately written him off when they\nhad all they wanted,\" Waldour acknowledged. \"But to get back to our\ntroubles--Dr. Ruthven is right to assume the worst. I believe we can\nonly insure the recovery of our project by thinking that these tapes\nwere snooped anywhere from eighteen months ago to last week. And we must\nwork accordingly!\"\n\nThere was silence in the room as they all considered that. Ashe slipped\ndown in his chair, his thoughts enmeshed in memories. First there had\nbeen Operation Retrograde, when specially trained \"time agents\" had\nshuttled back and forth in history, striving to locate and track down\nthe mysterious source of alien knowledge which the eastern Communistic\nnations had suddenly begun to use.\n\nAshe himself and a younger partner, Ross Murdock, had been part of the\nfinal action which had solved the mystery, having traced that source of\nknowledge not to an earlier and forgotten Terran civilization but to\nwrecked spaceships from an eon-old galactic empire--an empire which had\nflourished when glacial ice covered most of Europe and northern America\nand Terrans were cave-dwelling primitives. Murdock, trapped by the Reds\nin one of those wrecked ships, had inadvertently summoned its original\nowners, who had descended to trace--through the Russian time\nstations--the looters of their wrecks, destroying the whole Red\ntime-travel system.\n\nBut the aliens had not chanced on the parallel western system. And a\nyear later that had been put into Project Folsom One. Again Ashe,\nMurdock, and a newcomer, the Apache Travis Fox, had gone back into time\nto the Arizona of the Folsom hunters, discovering what they wanted--two\nships, one wrecked, the other intact. And when the full efforts of the\nproject had been centered on bringing the intact ship back into the\npresent, chance had triggered controls set by the dead alien commander.\nA party of four, Ashe, Murdock, Fox, and a technician, had then made an\ninvoluntary voyage into space, touching three worlds on which the\ngalactic civilization of the far past was now marked only by ruins.\n\nVoyage tape fed into the controls of the ship had taken the men, and,\nwhen rewound, had--by a miracle--returned them to Terra with a cargo of\nsimilar tapes found in a building on a world which might have been the\ncentral capital for a government comprised not of countries or of worlds\nbut of solar systems. Tapes--each one the key to another planet.\n\nAnd that ancient galactic knowledge was treasure such as the Terrans had\nnever dreamed of possessing, though there were the attendant fears that\nsuch discoveries could be weapons in enemy hands. There had been an\nenforced sharing with other nations of tapes chosen at random at a great\ndrawing. And each nation secretly remained convinced that, in spite of\nthe untold riches it might hold as a result of chance, its rivals had\ndone better. Right at this moment, Ashe did not in the least doubt,\nthere were agents of his own party intent on accomplishing at the Red\nproject just what Camdon had done there. However, that did not help in\nsolving their present dilemma concerning Operation Cochise, one part of\ntheir project, but perhaps the most important now.\n\nSome of the tapes were duds, either too damaged to be useful, or set for\nworlds hostile to Terrans lacking the equipment the earlier\nstar-traveling race had had at its command. Of the five tapes they now\nknew had been snooped, three would be useless to the enemy.\n\nBut one of the remaining two.... Ashe frowned. One was the goal toward\nwhich they had been working feverishly for a full twelve months. To\nplant a colony across the gulf of space--a successful colony--later to\nbe used as a steppingstone to other worlds....\n\n\"So we have to move faster.\" Ruthven's comment reached Ashe through his\nstream of memories.\n\n\"I thought you required at least three more months to conclude personnel\ntraining,\" Waldour observed.\n\nRuthven lifted a fat hand, running the nail of a broad thumb back and\nforth across his lower lip in a habitual gesture Ashe had learned to\nmistrust. As the latter stiffened, bracing for a battle of wills, he saw\nKelgarries come alert too. At least the colonel more often than not was\nready to counter Ruthven's demands.\n\n\"We test and we test,\" said the fat man. \"Always we test. We move like\nturtles when it would be better to race like greyhounds. There is such a\nthing as overcaution, as I have said from the first. One would\nthink\"--his accusing glance included Ashe and Kelgarries--\"that there\nhad never been any improvising in this project, that all had always been\ndone by the book. I say that this is the time we must take the big\ngamble, or else we may find we have been outbid for space entirely. Let\nthose others discover even one alien installation they can master and--\"\nhis thumb shifted from his lip, grinding down on the desk top as if it\nwere crushing some venturesome but entirely unimportant insect--\"and we\nare finished before we really begin.\"\n\nThere were a number of men in the project who would agree with that,\nAshe knew. And a greater number in the country and conference at large.\nThe public was used to reckless gambles which paid off, and there had\nbeen enough of those in the past to give an impressive argument for\nthat point of view. But Ashe, himself, could not agree to a speed-up. He\nhad been out among the stars, shaved disaster too closely because the\nproper training had not been given.\n\n\"I shall report that I advise a take-off within a week,\" Ruthven was\ncontinuing. \"To the council I shall say that--\"\n\n\"And I do not agree!\" Ashe cut in. He glanced at Kelgarries for the\nquick backing he expected, but instead there was a lengthening moment of\nsilence. Then the colonel spread out his hands and said sullenly:\n\n\"I don't agree either, but I don't have the final say-so. Ashe, what\nwould be needed to speed up any take-off?\"\n\nIt was Ruthven who replied. \"We can use the Redax, as I have said from\nthe start.\"\n\nAshe straightened, his mouth tight, his eyes hard and angry.\n\n\"And I'll protest that ... to the council! Man, we're dealing with human\nbeings--selected volunteers, men who trust us--not with laboratory\nanimals!\"\n\nRuthven's thick lips pouted into what was close to a smile of derision.\n\"Always the sentimentalists, you experts in the past! Tell me, Dr. Ashe,\nwere you always so thoughtful of your men when you sent agents back into\ntime? And certainly a voyage into space is less a risk than time travel.\nThese volunteers know what they have signed for. They will be ready----\"\n\n\"Then you propose telling them about the use of Redax--what it does to a\nman's mind?\" countered Ashe.\n\n\"Certainly. They will receive all necessary instructions.\"\n\nAshe was not satisfied and he would have spoken again, but Kelgarries\ninterrupted:\n\n\"If it comes to that, none of us here has any right to make final\ndecisions. Waldour has already sent in his report about the snoop. We'll\nhave to await orders from the council.\"\n\nRuthven levered himself out of his chair, his solid bulk stretching his\nuniform coveralls. \"That is correct, Colonel. In the meantime I would\nsuggest we all check to see what can be done to speed up each one's\nportion of labor.\" Without another word, he tramped to the door.\n\nWaldour eyed the other two with mounting impatience. It was plain he had\nwork to do and wanted them to leave. But Ashe was reluctant. He had a\nfeeling that matters were slipping out of his control, that he was about\nto face a crisis which was somehow worse than just a major security\nleak. Was the enemy always on the other side of the world? Or could he\nwear the same uniform, even share the same goals?\n\nIn the outer corridor he still hesitated, and Kelgarries, a step or so\nin advance, looked back over his shoulder impatiently.\n\n\"There's no use fighting--our hands are tied.\" His words were slurred,\nalmost as if he wanted to disown them.\n\n\"Then you'll agree to use the Redax?\" For the second time within the\nhour Ashe felt as if he had taken a step only to have firm earth turn\ninto slippery, shifting sand underfoot.\n\n\"It isn't a matter of my agreeing. It may be a matter of getting through\nor not getting through--now. If they've had eighteen months, or even\ntwelve...!\" The colonel's fingers balled into a fist. \"And _they_ won't\nbe delayed by any humanitarian reasoning----\"\n\n\"Then you believe Ruthven will win the council's approval?\"\n\n\"When you are dealing with frightened men, you're talking to ears closed\nto anything but what they want to hear. After all, we can't prove that\nthe Redax will be harmful.\"\n\n\"But we've only used it under rigidly controlled conditions. To speed up\nthe process would mean a total disregard of those controls. Snapping a\nparty of men and women back into their racial past and holding them\nthere for too long a period....\" Ashe shook his head.\n\n\"You have been in Operation Retrograde from the start, and we've been\nremarkably successful----\"\n\n\"Operating in a different way, educating picked men to return to certain\npoints in history where their particular temperaments and\ncharacteristics fitted the roles they were selected to play, yes. And\neven then we had our percentage of failures. But to try this--returning\npeople not physically into time, but _mentally and emotionally_ into\nprototypes of their ancestors--that's something else again. The Apaches\nhave volunteered, and they've been passed by the psychologists and the\ntesters. But they're Americans of today, not tribal nomads of two or\nthree hundred years ago. If you break down some barriers, you might just\nend up breaking them all.\"\n\nKelgarries was scowling. \"You mean--they might revert utterly, have no\ncontact with the present at all?\"\n\n\"That's just what I do mean. Education and training, yes, but full\nawakening of racial memories, no. The two branches of conditioning\nshould go slowly and hand in hand, otherwise--real trouble!\"\n\n\"Only we no longer have the time to go slow. I'm certain Ruthven will be\nable to push this through--with Waldour's report to back him.\"\n\n\"Then we'll have to warn Fox and the rest. They must be given a choice\nin the matter.\"\n\n\"Ruthven said that would be done.\" The colonel did not sound convinced\nof that.\n\nAshe snorted. \"If I hear him telling them, I'll believe it!\"\n\n\"I wonder whether we can....\"\n\nAshe half turned and frowned at the colonel. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"You said yourself that we had our failures in time travel. We expected\nthose, accepted them, even when they hurt. When we asked for volunteers\nfor this project we had to make them understand that there was a heavy\nelement of risk involved. Three teams of recruits--the Eskimos from\nPoint Barren, the Apaches, and the Islanders--all picked because their\npeople had a high survival rating in the past, to be colonists on widely\ndifferent types of planets. Well, the Eskimos and the Islanders aren't\nmatched to any of the worlds on those snooped tapes, but Topaz is\nwaiting for the Apaches. And we may have to move them in there in a\nhurry. It's a rotten gamble any way you see it!\"\n\n\"I'll appeal directly to the council.\"\n\nKelgarries shrugged. \"All right. You have my backing.\"\n\n\"But you believe such an effort hopeless?\"\n\n\"You know the red-tape merchants. You'll have to move fast if you want\nto beat Ruthven. He's probably on a straight line now to Stanton,\nReese, and Margate. This is what he has been waiting for!\"\n\n\"There are the news syndicates; public opinion would back us----\"\n\n\"You don't mean that, of course.\" Kelgarries was suddenly coldly remote.\n\nAshe flushed under the heavy brown which overlay his regular features.\nTo threaten a silence break was near blasphemy here. He ran both hands\ndown the fabric covering his thighs as if to rub away some soil on his\npalms.\n\n\"No,\" he replied heavily, his voice dull. \"I guess I don't. I'll contact\nHough and hope for the best.\"\n\n\"Meanwhile,\" Kelgarries spoke briskly, \"we'll do what we can to speed up\nthe program as it now stands. I suggest you take off for New York within\nthe hour----\"\n\n\"Me? Why?\" Ashe asked with a trace of suspicion.\n\n\"Because I can't leave without acting directly against orders, and that\nwould put us wrong immediately. You see Hough and talk to him\npersonally--put it to him straight. He'll have to have all the facts if\nhe's going to counter any move from Stanton before the council. You know\nevery argument we can use and all the proof on our side, and you're\nauthority enough to make it count.\"\n\n\"If I can do all that, I will.\" Ashe was alert and eager. The colonel,\nseeing his change of expression, felt easier.\n\nBut Kelgarries stood a moment watching Ashe as he hurried down a side\ncorridor, before he moved on slowly to his own box of office. Once\ninside he sat for a long unhappy time staring at the wall and seeing\nnothing but the pictures produced by his thoughts. Then he pressed a\nbutton and read off the symbols which flashed on a small visa-screen\nset in his desk. Another button pushed, and he picked up a hand mike to\nrelay an order which might postpone trouble for a while. Ashe was far\ntoo valuable a man to lose, and his emotions could boil him straight\ninto disaster over this.\n\n\"Bidwell--reschedule Team A. They are to go to the Hypno-Lab instead of\nthe reserve in ten minutes.\"\n\nReleasing the mike, he again stared at the wall. No one dared interrupt\na hypno-training period, and this one would last three hours. Ashe could\nnot possibly see the trainees before he left for New York. And that\nwould remove one temptation from his path--he would not talk at the\nwrong time.\n\nKelgarries' mouth twisted sourly. He had no pride in what he was doing.\nAnd he was perfectly certain that Ruthven would win and that Ashe's\nfears of Redax were well founded. It all came back to the old basic\ntenet of the service: the end justified the means. They must use every\nmethod and man under their control to make sure that Topaz would remain\na western possession, even though that strange planet now swung far\nbeyond the sky which covered both the western and eastern alliances on\nTerra. Time had run out too fast; they were being forced to play what\ncards they held, even though those might be very low ones. Ashe would be\nback, but not, Kelgarries hoped, until this had been decided one way or\nanother. Not until this was finished.\n\nFinished! Kelgarries blinked at the wall. Perhaps _they_ were finished,\ntoo. No one would know until the transport ship landed on that other\nworld which appeared on the direction tape symbolized by a jewellike\ndisk of gold-brown which had given it the code name of Topaz.\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nThere were an even dozen of the air-borne guardians, each following the\nswing of its own orbital path just within the atmospheric envelope of\nthe planet which glowed as a great bronze-golden gem in the four-world\nsystem of a yellow star. The globes had been launched to form a web of\nprotection around Topaz six months earlier, and the highest skill had\ngone into their production. Just as contact mines sown in a harbor could\nclose that landfall to ships not knowing the secret channel, so was this\nworld supposedly closed to any spaceship not equipped with the signal to\nward off the sphere missiles.\n\nThat was the theory of the new off-world settlers whose protection they\nwere to be, already tested as well as possible, but as yet not put to\nthe ultimate proof. The small bright globes spun undisturbed across a\ntwo-mooned sky at night and made reassuring blips on an installation\nscreen by day.\n\nThen a thirteenth object winked into being, began the encircling,\nclosing spiral of descent. A sphere resembling the warden-globes, it was\na hundred times their size, and its orbit was purposefully controlled\nby instruments under the eye and hand of a human pilot.\n\nFour men were strapped down on cushioned sling-seats in the control\ncabin of the Western Alliance ship, two hanging where their fingers\nmight reach buttons and levers, the others merely passengers, their own\nlabor waiting for the time when they would set down on the alien soil of\nTopaz. The planet hung there in their visa-screen, richly beautiful in\nits amber gold, growing larger, nearer, so that they could pick out\nfeatures of seas, continents, mountain ranges, which had been studied on\ntape until they were familiar, yet now were strangely unfamiliar too.\n\nOne of the warden-globes alerted, oscillated in its set path, whirled\nfaster as its delicate interior mechanisms responded to the awakening\nspark which would send it on its mission of destruction. A relay\nclicked, but for the smallest fraction of a millimeter failed to set the\nproper course. On the instrument, far below, which checked the globe's\nnew course the mistake was not noted.\n\nThe screen of the ship spiraling toward Topaz registered a path which\nwould bring it into violent contact with the globe. They were still some\nhundreds of miles apart when the alarm rang. The pilot's hand clawed out\nat the bank of controls; under the almost intolerable pressure of their\ndescent, there was so little he could do. His crooked fingers fell back\npowerlessly from the buttons and levers; his mouth was a twisted grimace\nof bleak acceptance as the beat of the signal increased.\n\nOne of the passengers forced his head around on the padded rest, fought\nto form words, to speak to his companion. The other was staring ahead at\nthe screen, his thick lips wide and flat against his teeth in a snarl\nof rage.\n\n\"They ... are ... here....\"\n\nRuthven paid no attention to the obvious as stated by his fellow\nscientist. His fury was a red, pulsing thing inside him, fed by his own\nhelplessness. To be pinned here so near his goal, fastened up as a\ntarget for an inanimate but cunningly fashioned weapon, ate into him\nlike a stream of deadly acid. His big gamble would puff out in a blast\nof fire to light up Topaz's sky, with nothing left--nothing. On the\narmrest of his sling-seat his nails scratched deep.\n\nThe four men in the control cabin could only sit and watch, waiting for\nthe rendezvous which would blot them out. Ruthven's flaming anger was a\nfutile blaze. His companion in the passenger seat had closed his eyes,\nhis lips moving soundlessly in an expression of his own scattered\nthoughts. The pilot and his assistant divided their attention between\nthe screen, with its appalling message, and the controls they could not\neffectively use, feverishly seeking a way out in these last moments.\n\nBelow them in the bowl of the ship were those who would not know the end\nconsciously--save in one compartment. In a padded cage a prick-eared\nhead stirred where it rested on forepaws, slitted eyes blinked, aware\nnot only of familiar surroundings, but also of the tension and fear\ngenerated by human minds and emotions levels above. A pointed nose\nraised, and there was a growling deep in a throat covered with thick\nbuff-gray hair.\n\nThe growl aroused another similar captive. Knowing yellow eyes met\nyellow eyes. An intelligence, which was certainly not that of the animal\nbody which contained it, fought down instinct raging to send both those\nbodies hurtling at the fastenings of the twin cages. Curiosity and the\nability to adapt had been bred into both from time immemorial. Then\nsomething else had been added to sly and cunning brains. A step up had\nbeen taken--to weld intelligence to cunning, connect thought to\ninstinct.\n\nMore than a generation earlier mankind had chosen barren desert--the\n\"white sands\" of New Mexico--as a testing ground for atomic experiments.\nHumankind could be barred, warded out of the radiation limits; the\nnatural desert dwellers, four-footed and winged, could not be so\ncontrolled.\n\nFor thousands of years, since the first southward roving Amerindian\ntribes had met with their kind, there had been a hunter of the open\ncountry, a smaller cousin of the wolf, whose natural abilities had made\nan undeniable impression on the human mind. He was in countless Indian\nlegends as the Shaper or the Trickster, sometimes friend, sometimes\nenemy. Godling for some tribes, father of all evil for others. In the\nwealth of tales the coyote, above all other animals, had a firm place.\n\nDriven by the press of civilization into the badlands and deserts,\nfought with poison, gun, and trap, the coyote had survived, adapting to\nnew ways with all his legendary cunning. Those who had reviled him as\nvermin had unwillingly added to the folklore which surrounded him,\ntelling their own tales of robbed traps, skillful escapes. He continued\nto be a trickster, laughing on moonlit nights from the tops of ridges at\nthose who would hunt him down.\n\nThen, close to the end of the twentieth century, when myths were\nscoffed at, the stories of the coyote's slyness began once more on a\nfantastic scale. And finally scientists were sufficiently intrigued to\nseek out this creature that seemed to display in truth all the abilities\ncredited to his immortal namesake by pre-Columbian tribes.\n\nWhat they discovered was indeed shattering to certain closed minds. For\nthe coyote had not only adapted to the country of the white sands; he\nhad evolved into something which could not be dismissed as an animal,\nclever and cunning, but limited to beast range. Six cubs had been\nbrought back on the first expedition, coyote in body, their developing\nminds different. The grandchildren of those cubs were now in the ship's\ncages, their mutated senses alert, ready for the slightest chance of\nescape. Sent to Topaz as eyes and ears for less keenly endowed humans,\nthey were not completely under the domination of man. The range of their\nmental powers was still uncomprehended by those who had bred, trained,\nand worked with them from the days their eyes had opened and they had\ntaken their first wobbly steps away from their dams.\n\nThe male growled again, his lips wrinkling back in a snarl as the\nemanations of fear from the men he could not see reached panic peak. He\nstill crouched, belly flat, on the protecting pads of his cage; but he\nstrove now to wriggle closer to the door, just as his mate made the same\neffort.\n\nBetween the animals and those in the control cabin lay the others--forty\nof them. Their bodies were cushioned and protected with every ingenious\ndevice known to those who had placed them there so many weeks earlier.\nTheir minds were free of the ship, roving into places where men had not\ntrod before, a territory potentially more dangerous than any solid earth\ncould ever be.\n\nOperation Retrograde had returned men bodily into the past, sending\nagents to hunt mammoths, follow the roads of the Bronze Age traders,\nride with Attila and Genghis Khan, pull bows among the archers of\nancient Egypt. But Redax returned men in mind to the paths of their\nancestors, or this was the theory. And those who slept here and now in\ntheir narrow boxes, lay under its government, while the men who had\narbitrarily set them so could only assume they were actually reliving\nthe lives of Apache nomads in the wide southwestern wastes of the late\neighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.\n\nAbove, the pilot's hand pushed out again, fighting the pressure to reach\none particular button. That, too, had been a last-minute addition, an\nexperiment which had only had partial testing. To use it was the final\nmove he could make, and he was already half convinced of its\nuselessness.\n\nWith no faith and only a very wan hope, he sent that round of metal\nflush with the board. What followed no one ever lived to explain.\n\nOn the planet the installation which tracked the missiles flashed on a\nscreen bright enough to blind momentarily the duty man on watch, and its\ntracker was shaken off course. When it jiggled back into line it was no\nlonger the efficient eye-in-the-sky it had been, though its tenders were\nnot to realize that for an important minute or two.\n\nWhile the ship, now out of control, sped in dizzy whirls toward Topaz,\nengines fought blindly to stabilize, to re-establish their functions.\nSome succeeded, some wobbled in and out of the danger zone, two failed.\nAnd in the control cabin three dead men spun in prisoning seats.\n\nDr. James Ruthven, blood bubbling from his lips with every shallow\nbreath he could draw, fought the stealthy tide of blackness which crept\nup his brain, his stubborn will holding to rags of consciousness,\nrefusing to acknowledge the pain of his fatally injured body.\n\nThe orbiting ship was on an erratic path. Slowly the machines were\ncorrecting, relays clicking, striving to bring it to a landing under\nauto-pilot. All the ingenuity built into a mechanical brain was now\ncentered in landing the globe.\n\nIt was not a good landing, in fact a very bad one, for the sphere\ntouched a mountain side, scraped down rocks, shearing away a portion of\nits outer bulk. But the mountain barrier was now between it and the base\nfrom which the missiles had been launched, and the crash had not been\nrecorded on that tracking instrument. So far as the watchers several\nhundred miles away knew, the warden in the sky had performed as\npromised. Their first line of defense had proven satisfactory, and there\nhad been no unauthorized landing on Topaz.\n\nIn the wreckage of the control cabin Ruthven pawed at the fastenings of\nhis sling-chair. He no longer tried to suppress the moans every effort\ntore out of him. Time held the whip, drove him. He rolled from his seat\nto the floor, lay there gasping, as again he fought doggedly to remain\nabove the waves--those frightening, fast-coming waves of dark faintness.\n\nSomehow he was crawling, crawling along a tilted surface until he gained\nthe well where the ladder to the lower section hung, now at an acute\nangle. It was that angle which helped him to the next level.\n\nHe was too dazed to realize the meaning of the crumpled bulkheads. There\nwas a spur of bare rock under his hands as he edged over and around\ntwisted metal. The moans were now a gobbling, burbling, almost\ncontinuous cry as he reached his goal--a small cabin still intact.\n\nFor long moments of anguish he paused by the chair there, afraid that he\ncould not make the last effort, raise his almost inert bulk up to the\npoint where he could reach the Redax release. For a second of unusual\nclarity he wondered if there was any reason for this supreme ordeal,\nwhether any of the sleepers could be aroused. This might now be a ship\nof the dead.\n\nHis right hand, his arm, and finally his bulk over the seat, he braced\nhimself and brought his left hand up. He could not use any of the\nfingers; it was like lifting numb, heavy weights. But he lurched\nforward, swept the unfeeling lump of cold flesh down against the release\nin a gesture which he knew must be his final move. And, as he fell back\nto the floor, Dr. Ruthven could not be certain whether he had succeeded\nor failed. He tried to screw his head around, to focus his eyes upward\nat that switch. Was it down or still stubbornly up, locking the sleepers\ninto confinement? But there was a fog between; he could not see it--or\nanything.\n\nThe light in the cabin flickered, was gone as another circuit in the\nbroken ship failed. It was dark, too, in the small cubby below which\nhoused the two cages. Chance, which had snuffed out nineteen lives in\nthe space globe, had missed ripping open that cabin on the mountain\nside. Five yards down the corridor the outside fabric of the ship was\nsplit wide open, the crisp air native to Topaz entering, sending a\nmessage to two keen noses through the combination of odors now pervading\nthe wreckage.\n\nAnd the male coyote went into action. Days ago he had managed to work\nloose the lower end of the mesh which fronted his cage, but his mind had\ntold him that a sortie inside the ship was valueless. The odd rapport\nhe'd had with the human brains, unknown to them, had operated to keep\nhim to the old role of cunning deception, which in the past had saved\ncountless of his species from sudden and violent death. Now with teeth\nand paws he went diligently to work, urged on by the whines of his mate,\nthat tantalizing smell of an outside world tickling their nostrils--a\nwild world, lacking the taint of man-places.\n\nHe slipped under the loosened mesh and stood up to paw at the front of\nthe female's cage. One forepaw caught in the latch and pressed it down,\nand the weight of the door swung against him. Together they were free\nnow to reach the corridor and see ahead the subdued light of a strange\nmoon beckoning them on into the open.\n\nThe female, always more cautious than her mate, lingered behind as he\ntrotted forward, his ears a-prick with curiosity. Their training had\nbeen the same since cubhood--to range and explore, but always in the\ncompany and at the order of man. This was not according to the pattern\nshe knew, and she was suspicious. But to her sensitive nose the smell of\nthe ship was an offense, and the puffs of breeze from without enticing.\nHer mate had already slipped through the break; now he barked with\nexcitement and wonder, and she trotted on to join him.\n\nAbove, the Redax, which had never been intended to stand rough usage,\nproved to be a better survivor of the crash than most of the other\ninstallations. Power purred along a network of lines, activated beams,\nturned off and on a series of fixtures in those coffin-beds. For five of\nthe sleepers--nothing. The cabin which had held them was a flattened\nsmear against the mountain side. Three more half aroused, choked, fought\nfor life and breath in a darkness which was a mercifully short\nnightmare, and succumbed.\n\nBut in the cabin nearest the rent through which the coyotes had escaped,\na young man sat up abruptly, looking into the dark with wide-open,\nterror-haunted eyes. He clawed for purchase against the smooth edge of\nthe box in which he had lain, somehow got to his knees, weaving weakly\nback and forth, and half fell, half pushed to the floor where he could\nstand only by keeping his hold on the box.\n\nDazed, sick, weak, he swayed there, aware only of himself and his own\nsensations. There were small sounds in the dark, a stilled moan, a\ngasping sigh. But that meant nothing. Within him grew a compulsion to be\nout of this place, his terror making him lurch forward.\n\nHis flailing hand rapped painfully against an upright surface which his\nquesting fingers identified hazily as an exit. Unconsciously he fumbled\nalong the surface of the door until it gave under that weak pressure.\nThen he was out, his head swimming, drawn by the light behind the wall\nrent.\n\nHe progressed toward that in a scrambling crawl, making his way over the\nsplintered skin of the globe. Then he dropped with a jarring thud onto\nthe mound of earth the ship had pushed before it during its downward\nslide. Limply he tumbled on in a small cascade of clods and sand,\nhitting against a less movable rock with force enough to roll him over\non his back and stun him again.\n\nThe second and smaller moon of Topaz swung brightly through the sky, its\nweird green rays making the blood-streaked face of the explorer an alien\nmask. It had passed well on to the horizon, and its large yellow\ncompanion had risen when a yapping broke the small sounds of the night.\n\nAs the _yipp, yipp, yipp_ arose in a crescendo, the man stirred, putting\none hand to his head. His eyes opened, he looked vaguely about him and\nsat up. Behind him was the torn and ripped ship, but he did not look\nback at it.\n\nInstead, he got to his feet and staggered out into the direct path of\nthe moonlight. Inside his brain there was a whirl of thoughts, memories,\nemotions. Perhaps Ruthven or one of his assistants could have explained\nthat chaotic mixture for what it was. But for all practical purposes\nTravis Fox--Amerindian Time Agent, member of Team A, Operation\nCochise--was far less of a thinking animal now than the two coyotes\npaying their ritual addresses to a moon which was not the one of their\nvanished homeland.\n\nTravis wavered on, drawn somehow by that howling. It was familiar, a\nthread of something real through all the broken clutter in his head. He\nstumbled, fell, crawled up again, but he kept on.\n\nAbove, the female coyote lowered her head, drew a test sniff of a new\nscent. She recognized that as part of the proper way of life. She yapped\nonce at her mate, but he was absorbed in his night song, his muzzle\npointed moonward as he voiced a fine wailing.\n\nTravis tripped, pitched forward on his hands and knees, and felt the jar\nof such a landing shoot up his stiffened forearms. He tried to get up,\nbut his body only twisted, so he landed on his back and lay looking up\nat the moon.\n\nA strong, familiar odor ... then a shadow looming above him. Hot breath\nagainst his cheek, and the swift sweep of an animal tongue on his face.\nHe flung up his hand, gripped thick fur, and held on as if he had found\none anchor of sanity in a world gone completely mad.\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nTravis, one knee braced against the red earth, blinked as he parted a\nscreen of tall rust-brown grass with cautious fingers to look out into a\nvalley where golden mist clouded most of the landscape. His head ached\nwith dull persistence, the pain fostered in some way by his own\nbewilderment. To study the land ahead was like trying to see through one\npicture interposed over another and far different one. He knew what\nought to be there, but what was before him was very dissimilar.\n\nA buff-gray shape flitted through the tall cover grass, and Travis\ntensed. _Mba'a_--coyote? Or were these companions of his actually\n_ga-n_, spirits who could choose their shape at will and had, oddly,\nthis time assumed the bodies of man's tricky enemy? Were they\n_ndendai_--enemies--or _dalaanbiyat'i_, allies? In this mad world he did\nnot know.\n\n_Ei'dik'e?_ His mind formed a word he did not speak: Friend?\n\nYellow eyes met his directly. Dimly he had been aware, ever since\nawaking in this strange wilderness with the coming of morning light,\nthat the four-footed ones trotting with him as he walked aimlessly had\nunbeastlike traits. Not only did they face him eye-to-eye, but in some\nways they appeared able to read his thoughts.\n\nHe had longed for water to ease the burning in his throat, the\never-present pain in his head, and the creatures had nudged him in\nanother direction, bringing him to a pool where he had mouthed liquid\nwith a strange sweet, but not unpleasant taste.\n\nNow he had given them names, names which had come out of the welter of\ndreams which shadowed his stumbling journey across this weird country.\n\nNalik'ideyu (Maiden-Who-Walks-Ridges) was the female who continued to\nshepherd him along, never venturing too far from his side. Naginlta\n(He-Who-Scouts-Ahead) was the male who did just that, disappearing at\nlong intervals and then returning to face the man and his mate as if\nconveying some report necessary to their journey.\n\nIt was Nalik'ideyu who sought out Travis now, her red tongue lolling\nfrom her mouth as she panted. Not from exertion, he was certain of that.\nNo, she was excited and eager ... on the hunt! That was it--a hunt!\n\nTravis' own tongue ran across his lips as an impression hit him with\nferal force. There was meat--rich, fresh--just ahead. Meat that lived,\nwaiting to be killed. Inside him his own avid hunger roused, shaking him\nfarther out of the crusting dream.\n\nHis hands went to his waist, but the groping fingers did not find what\nvague memory told him should be there--a belt, heavy with knife in\nsheath.\n\nHe examined his own body with attention to find he was adequately\ncovered by breeches of a smooth, dull brown material which blended well\nwith the vegetation about him. He wore a loose shirt, belted in at the\nnarrow waist by a folded strip of cloth, the ends of which fluttered\nfree. On his feet were tall moccasins, the leg pieces extending some\ndistance up his calves, the toes turned up in rounded points.\n\nSome of this he found familiar, but these were fragments of memory;\nagain his mind fitted one picture above another. One thing he did know\nfor sure--he had no weapons. And that realization struck home with a\nthrust of real and terrible fear which tore away more of the\nbewilderment cloaking his mind.\n\nNalik'ideyu was impatient. Having advanced a step or two, she now looked\nback at him over her shoulder, yellow eyes slitted, her demand on him as\ninstant and real as if she had voiced understandable words. Meat was\nwaiting, and she was hungry. Also she expected Travis to aid in the\nhunt--at once.\n\nThough he could not match her fluid grace in moving through the grass,\nTravis followed her, keeping to cover. He shook his head vigorously, in\nspite of the stab of pain the motion cost him, and paid more attention\nto his surroundings. It was apparent that the earth under him, the grass\naround, the valley of the golden haze, were all real, not part of a\ndream. Therefore that other countryside which he kept seeing in a\nghostly fashion was a hallucination.\n\nEven the air which he drew into his lungs and expelled again, had a\nstrange smell, or was it taste? He could not be sure which. He knew that\nhypno-training could produce queer side effects, but ... this....\n\nTravis paused, staring unseeingly before him at the grass still waving\nfrom the coyote's passage. Hypno-training! What was that? Now three\npictures fought to focus in his mind: the two landscapes which did not\nmatch and a shadowy third. He shook his head again, his hands to his\ntemples. This--this only was real: the ground, the grass, the valley,\nthe hunger in him, the hunt waiting....\n\nHe forced himself to concentrate on the immediate present and the\nportion of world he could see, feel, scent, which lay here and now about\nhim.\n\nThe grass grew shorter as he proceeded in Nalik'ideyu's wake. But the\nhaze was not thinning. It seemed to hang in patches, and when he\nventured through the edge of a patch it was like creeping through a fog\nof golden, dancing motes with here and there a glittering speck whirling\nand darting like a living thing. Masked by the stuff, Travis reached a\nline of brush and sniffed.\n\nIt was a warm scent, a heavy odor he could not identify and yet one he\nassociated with a living creature. Flat to earth, he pushed head and\nshoulders under the low limbs of the bush to look ahead.\n\nHere was a space where the fog did not hold, a pocket of earth clear\nunder the morning sun. And grazing there were three animals. Again shock\ncleared a portion of Travis' bemused brain.\n\nThey were about the size, he thought, of antelopes, and they had a\ngeneral resemblance to those beasts in that they had four slender legs,\na rounded body, and a head. But they had alien features, so alien as to\nhold him in open-mouthed amazement.\n\nThe bodies had bare spots here and there, and patches of creamy--fur? Or\nwas it hair which hung in strips, as if the creatures had been partially\nplucked in a careless fashion? The necks were long and moved about in a\nserpentine motion, as though their spines were as limber as reptiles'.\nOn the end of those long and twisting necks were heads which also\nappeared more suitable to another species--broad, rather flat, with a\nsingular toadlike look--but furnished with horns set halfway down the\nnose, horns which began in a single root and then branched into two\nsharp points.\n\nThey were unearthly! Again Travis blinked, brought his hand up to his\nhead as he continued to view the browsers. There were three of them: two\nlarger and with horns, the other a smaller beast with less of the ragged\nfur and only the beginning button of a protuberance on the nose; it was\nprobably a calf.\n\nOne of those mental alerts from the coyotes broke his absorption.\nNalik'ideyu was not interested in the odd appearance of the grazing\ncreatures; she was intent upon their usefulness in another way--as a\nfull and satisfying meal--and she was again impatient with him for his\ndull response.\n\nHis examination took a more practical turn. An antelope's defense was\nspeed, though it could be tricked into hunting range through its\ninordinate curiosity. The slender legs of these beasts suggested a like\ndegree of speed, and Travis had no weapons at all.\n\nThose nose horns had an ugly look; this thing might be a fighter rather\nthan a runner. But the suggestion which had flashed from coyote to him\nhad taken root. Travis was hungry, he was a hunter, and here was meat on\nthe hoof, queer as it looked.\n\nAgain he received a message. Naginlta was on the opposite side of the\nclearing. If the creatures depended on speed, then Travis believed they\ncould probably outrun not only him but the coyotes as well--which left\ncunning and some sort of plan.\n\nTravis glanced at the cover where he knew Nalik'ideyu crouched and from\nwhich had come that flash of agreement. He shivered. These were truly no\nanimals, but _ga-n_, _ga-n_ of power! And as _ga-n_ he must treat them,\naccede to their will. Spurred by that, the Apache gave only flicks of\nattention to the browsers while at the same time he studied the part of\nthe landscape uncovered by mist.\n\nWithout weapons or speed, they must conceive a trap. Again Travis sensed\nthat agreement which was _ga-n_ magic, and with it the strong impression\nurging him to the right. He was making progress with skill he did not\neven recognize and which he had never been conscious of learning.\n\nThe bushes and small, droop-limbed trees, their branches not clothed\nwith leaves from proper twigs but with a reddish bristly growth\nprotruding directly from their surfaces, made a partial wall for the\npocket-sized meadow. That screen reached a rocky cleft where the mist\ncurled in a long tongue through a wall twice Travis' height. If the\nbrowsers could be maneuvered into taking the path through that cleft....\n\nTravis searched about him, and his hands closed upon the oldest weapon\nof his species, a stone pulled from an earth pocket and balanced neatly\nin the palm of his hand. It was a long chance but his best one.\n\nThe Apache took the first step on a new and fearsome road. These _ga-n_\nhad put their thoughts--or their desires--into his mind. Could he so\ncontact them in return?\n\nWith the stone clenched in his fist, his shoulders back against the wall\nnot too far from the cleft opening, Travis strove to think out, clearly\nand simply, this poor plan of his. He did not know that he was reacting\nthe way scientists deep space away had hoped he might. Nor did Travis\nguess that at this point he had already traveled far beyond the\nexpectations of the men who had bred and trained the two mutant coyotes.\nHe only believed that this might be the one way he could obey the wishes\nof the two spirits he thought far more powerful than any man. So he\npictured in his mind the cleft, the running creatures, and the part the\n_ga-n_ could play if they so willed.\n\nAssent--in its way as loud and clear as if shouted. The man fingered the\nstone, weighed it. There would probably be just one moment when he could\nuse it to effect, and he must be ready.\n\nFrom this point he could no longer see the small meadow where the\ngrazers were. But Travis knew, as well as if he watched the scene, that\nthe coyotes were creeping in, belly flat to earth, adding a feline\nstealth and patience to their own cunning.\n\nThere! Travis' head jerked, the alert had come, the drive was beginning.\nHe tensed, gripping his stone.\n\nA yapping bark was answered by a sound he could not describe, a noise\nwhich was neither cough nor grunt but a combination of both. Again a\nyap-yap....\n\nA toad-head burst through the screen of brush, the double horn on its\nnose festooned with a length of grass torn up by the roots. Wide\neyes--milky and seeming to be without pupils--fastened on Travis, but he\ncould not be sure the thing saw him, for it kept on, picking up speed\nas it approached the cleft. Behind it ran the calf, and that guttural\ncry was bubbling from its broad flat lips.\n\nThe long neck of the adult writhed, the frog-head swung closer to the\nground so that the twin points of the horn were at a slant--aimed now at\nTravis. He had been right in his guess at their deadliness, but he had\nonly a fleeting chance to recognize that fact as the thing bore down,\nits whole attitude expressing the firm intention of goring him.\n\nHe hurled his stone and then flung his body to one side, stumbling and\nrolling into the brush where he fought madly to regain his feet,\nexpecting at any moment to feel trampling hoofs and thrusting horns.\nThere was a crash to his right, and the bushes and grass were wildly\nshaken.\n\nOn his hands and knees the Apache retreated, his head turned to watch\nbehind him. He saw the flirt of a triangular flap-tail in the mouth of\nthe cleft. The calf had escaped. And now the threshing in the bushes\nstilled.\n\nWas the thing stalking him? He got to his feet, for the first time\nhearing clearly the continued yapping, as if a battle was in progress.\nThen the second of the adult beasts came into view, backing and turning,\ntrying to keep lowered head with menacing double horn always pointed to\nthe coyotes dancing a teasing, worrying circle about it.\n\nOne of the coyotes flung up its head, looked upslope, and barked. Then,\nas one, both rushed the fighting beast, but for the first time from the\nsame side, leaving it a clear path to retreat. It made a rush before\nwhich they fled easily, and then it whirled with a speed and grace,\nwhich did not fit its ungainly, ill-proportioned body, and jumped\ntoward the cleft, the coyotes making no effort to hinder its escape.\n\nTravis came out of cover, approaching the brush which had concealed the\ncrash of the other animal. The actions of the coyotes had convinced him\nthat there was no danger now; they would never have allowed the escape\nof their prey had the first beast not been in difficulties.\n\nHis shot with the stone, the Apache decided as he stood moments later\nsurveying the twitching crumpled body, must have hit the thing in the\nhead, stunning it. Then the momentum of its charge had carried it full\nforce against the rock to kill it. Blind luck--or the power of the\n_ga-n_? He pulled back as the coyotes came padding up shoulder to\nshoulder to inspect the kill. It was truly more theirs than his.\n\nTheir prey yielded not only food but a weapon for Travis. Instead of the\nbelt knife he had remembered having, he was now equipped with two. The\ndouble horn had been easy to free from the shattered skull, and some\ncareful work with stones had broken off one prong at just the angle he\nwanted. So now he had a short and a longer tool, defense. At least they\nwere better than the stone with which he had entered the hunt.\n\nNalik'ideyu pushed past him to lap daintily at the water. Then she sat\nup on her haunches, watching Travis as he smoothed the horn with a\nstone.\n\n\"A knife,\" he said to her, \"this will be a knife. And--\" he glanced up,\nmeasuring the value of the wood represented by trees and bushes--\"then a\nbow. With a bow we shall hunt better.\"\n\nThe coyote yawned, her yellow eyes half closed, her whole pose one of\nsatisfaction and contentment.\n\n\"A knife,\" Travis repeated, \"and a bow.\" He needed weapons; he had to\nhave them!\n\nWhy? His hand stopped scraping. Why? The toad-faced double horn had been\nquick to attack, but Travis could have avoided it, and it had not hunted\nhim first. Why was he ridden by this fear that he must not be unarmed?\n\nHe dipped his hand into the pool of the spring and lifted the water to\ncool his sweating face. The coyote moved, turned around in the grass,\ncrushing down the growth into a nest in which she curled up, head on\npaws. But Travis sat back on his heels, his now idle hands hanging down\nbetween his knees, and forced himself to the task of sorting out jumbled\nmemories.\n\nThis landscape was wrong--totally unlike what it should be--but it was\nreal. He had helped kill this alien creature. He had eaten its meat,\nraw. Its horn lay within touch now. All that was real and unchangeable.\nWhich meant that the rest of it, that other desert world in which he had\nwandered with his kind, ridden horses, raided invading men of another\nrace, that was not real--or else far, far removed from where he now sat.\n\nYet there had been no dividing line between those two worlds. One moment\nhe had been in the desert place, returning from a successful foray\nagainst the Mexicans. Mexicans! Travis caught at that identification,\ntried to use it as a thread to draw closer to the beginning of his\nmystery.\n\nMexicans.... And he was an Apache, one of the Eagle people, one who rode\nwith Cochise. No!\n\nSweat again beaded his face where the water had cooled it. He was not of\nthat past. He was Travis Fox, of the very late twentieth century, not a\nnomad of the middle nineteenth! He was of Team A of the project!\n\nThe Arizona desert and then this! From one to the other in an instant.\nHe looked about him in rising fear. Wait! He had been in the dark when\nhe got out of the desert, lying in a box. Getting out, he had crawled\ndown a passage to reach moonlight, strange moonlight.\n\nA box in which he had lain, a passage with smooth metallic walls, and an\nalien world at the end of it.\n\nThe coyote's ears twitched, her head came up, she was staring at the\nman's drawn face, at his eyes with their core of fear. She whined.\n\nTravis caught up the two pieces of horn, thrust them into his sash belt,\nand got to his feet. Nalik'ideyu sat up, her head cocked a little to one\nside. As the man turned to seek his own back trail she padded along in\nhis wake and whined for Naginlta. But Travis was more intent now on what\nhe must prove to himself than he was on the actions of the two animals.\n\nIt was a wandering trail, and now he did not question his skill in being\nable to follow it so unerringly. The sun was hot. Winged things buzzed\nfrom the bushes, small scuttling things fled from him through the tall\ngrass. Once Naginlta growled a warning which led them all to a detour,\nand Travis might not have picked up the proper trace again had not the\ncoyote scout led him to it.\n\n\"Who are you?\" he asked once, and then guessed it would have better been\nsaid, \"What are you?\" These were not animals, or rather they were more\nthan the animals he had always known. And one part of him, the part\nwhich remembered the desert rancherias where Cochise had ruled, said\nthey were spirits. Yet that other part of him.... Travis shook his\nhead, accepting them now for what they were--welcome company in an alien\nplace.\n\nThe day wore on close to sunset, and still Travis followed that\nwandering trail. The need which drove him kept him going through the\nrough country of hills and ravines. Now the mist lifted above towering\nwalls of mountains very near him, yet not the mountains of his memory.\nThese were dull brown, with a forbidding look, like sun-dried skulls\nbaring teeth in warning against all comers.\n\nWith great difficulty, Travis topped a rise. Ahead against the skyline\nstood both coyotes. And, as the man joined them, first one and then the\nother flung back its head and sounded the sobbing, shattering cry which\nhad been a part of that other life.\n\nThe Apache looked down. His puzzle was answered in part. The wreckage\ncrumpled on the mountain side was identifiable--a spaceship! Cold fear\ngripped him and his own head went back; from between his tight lips came\na cry as desolate and despairing as the one the animals had voiced.\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nFire, mankind's oldest ally, weapon, tool, leaped high before the naked\nstone of the mountain side. Men sat cross-legged about it, fifteen of\nthem. And behind, guarded by the flames and that somber circle, were the\nwomen. There was a uniformity in this gathering. The members were\nplainly all of the same racial stock, of medium height, stocky yet fined\ndown to the peak of stamina and endurance, their skin brown, their\nshoulder-length hair black. And they were all young--none over thirty,\nsome still in their late teens. Alike, too, was a certain drawn look in\ntheir faces, a tenseness of the eyes and mouth as they listened to\nTravis.\n\n\"So we must be on Topaz. Do any of you remember boarding the ship?\"\n\n\"No. Only that we awoke within it.\" Across the fire one chin lifted; the\neyes which caught Travis' held a deep, smoldering anger. \"This is more\ntrickery of the Pinda-lick-o-yi, the White Eyes. Between us there has\nnever been fair dealing. They have broken their promise as a man breaks\na rotten stick, for their words are as rotten. And it was you, Fox, who\nbrought us to listen to them.\"\n\nA stir about the circle, a murmur from the women.\n\n\"And do I not also sit here with you in this strange wilderness?\" he\ncountered.\n\n\"I do not understand,\" another of the men held out his hand, palm up, in\na gesture of asking--\"what has happened to us. We were in the old Apache\nworld.... I, Jil-Lee, was riding with Cuchillo Negro as we went down to\nthe taking of Ramos. And then I was here, in a broken ship and beside me\na dead man who was once my brother. How did I come out of the past of\nour people into another world across the stars?\"\n\n\"Pinda-lick-o-yi tricks!\" The first speaker spat into the fire.\n\n\"It was the Redax, I think,\" Travis replied. \"I heard Dr. Ashe discuss\nthis. A new machine which could make a man remember not his own past,\nbut the past of his ancestors. While we were on that ship we must have\nbeen under its influence, so we lived as our people lived a hundred\nyears or more ago--\"\n\n\"And the purpose of such a thing?\" Jil-Lee asked.\n\n\"To make us more like our ancestors perhaps. It is part of what they\ntold us at the project. To venture into these new worlds requires a\ndifferent type of man than lives on Terra today. Traits we have\nforgotten are needed to face the dangers of wild places.\"\n\n\"You, Fox, have been beyond the stars before, and you found there were\nsuch dangers to face?\"\n\n\"It is true. You have heard of the three worlds I saw when the ship from\nthe old days took us off, unwilling, to the stars. Did you not all\nvolunteer to pioneer in this manner so you could also see strange and\nnew things?\"\n\n\"But we did not agree to be returned to the past in medicine dreams and\nbe sent unknowingly into space!\"\n\nTravis nodded. \"Deklay is right. But I know no more than you why we were\nso sent, or why the ship crashed. We have found Dr. Ruthven's body in\nthe cabin with that new installation. Only we have discovered nothing\nelse which tells us why we were brought here. With the ship broken, we\nmust stay.\"\n\nThey were silent now, men and women alike. Behind them lay several days\nof activity, nights of exhausted slumber. Against the cliff wall lay the\npacks of supplies they had salvaged from the wreck. By mutual consent\nthey had left the vicinity of the broken globe, following their old\ncustom of speedily withdrawing from a place of death.\n\n\"This is a world empty of men?\" Jil-Lee wanted to know.\n\n\"So far we have found only animal signs, and the _ga-n_ have not warned\nus of anything else----\"\n\n\"Those devil ones!\" Again Deklay spat into the fire. \"I say we should\nhave no dealings with them. The _mba'a_ is no friend to the People.\"\n\nAgain a murmur which seemed one of agreement answered that outburst.\nTravis stiffened. Just how much influence had the Redax had over them?\nHe knew from his own experience that sometimes he had an odd double\nreaction--two different feelings which almost sickened him when they\nstruck simultaneously. And he was beginning to suspect that with some of\nthe others the return to the past had been far more deep and lasting.\nNow Jil-Lee was actually to reason out what had happened. While Deklay\nhad reverted to an ancestor who had ridden with Victorio or Magnus\nColorado! Travis had a flash of premonition, a chill which made him\nhalf foresee a time when the past and the present might well split them\napart--fatally.\n\n\"Devil or _ga-n_.\" A man with a quiet face, rather deeply sunken eyes,\nspoke for the first time. \"We are in two minds because of this Redax, so\nlet us not do anything in haste. Back in the desert world of the People\nI have seen the _mba'a_, and he was very clever. With the badger he went\nhunting, and when the badger had dug up the rat's nest, so did the\n_mba'a_ wait on the other side of the thorny bush and catch those who\nwould escape that way. Between him and the badger there was no war.\nThese two who sit over yonder now--they are also hunters and they seem\nfriendly to us. In a strange place a man needs all the help he can find.\nLet us not call names out of old tales, which may mean nothing in fact.\"\n\n\"Buck speaks straightly,\" Jil-Lee agreed. \"We seek a camp which can be\ndefended. For perhaps there are men here whose hunting territory we have\ninvaded, though we have not yet seen them. We are a people small in\nnumber and alone. Let us walk softly on trails which are strange to our\nfeet.\"\n\nInwardly Travis sighed in relief. Buck, Jil-Lee ... for the moment their\nsensible words appeared to swing the opinions of the party. If either of\nthem could be established as _haldzil_, or clan leader, they would all\nbe safer. He himself had no aspirations in that direction and dared not\npush too hard. It had been his initial urging which had brought them as\nvolunteers into the project. Now he was doubly suspect, and especially\nby those who thought as Deklay, he was considered too alien to their old\nways.\n\nSo far their protests had been fewer than he anticipated. Although\nbrothers and sisters had followed each other into the team after the\nimmemorial desire of Apaches to cling to family ties, they were not a\ntrue clan with solidity of that to back them, but representatives of\nhalf a dozen.\n\nBasically, back on Terra, they had all been among the most progressive\nof their people--progressive, that is, in the white man's sense of the\nword. Travis had a fleeting recognition of his now oblique way of\nthinking. He, too, had been marked by the Redax. They had all been\neducated in the modern fashion and all possessed a spirit of adventure\nwhich marked them over their fellows. They had volunteered for the team\nand successfully passed the tests to weed out the temperamentally unfit\nor fainthearted. But all that was before Redax....\n\nWhy had they been submitted to that? And why this flight? What had\npushed Dr. Ashe and Murdock and Colonel Kelgarries, time agents he knew\nand trusted, into dispatching them without warning to Topaz? Something\nhad happened, something which had given Dr. Ruthven ascendancy over\nthose others and had started them on this wild trip.\n\nTravis was conscious of a stir about the firelit circle. The men were\nrising, moving back into the shadows, stretching out on the blankets\nthey had found among other stores on the ship. They had discovered\nweapons there--knives, bows, quivers of arrows, all of which they had\nbeen trained to use in the intensive schooling of the project and which\nneeded no more repair than they themselves could give. And the rations\nthey carried were field supplies, few of them. Tomorrow they must begin\nhunting in earnest....\n\n\"Why has this thing been done to us?\" Buck was beside Travis, those\nquiet eyes sliding past him to seek the fire once more. \"I do not think\nyou were told when the rest of us were not----\"\n\nTravis seized upon that. \"There are those who say that I knew, agreed?\"\n\n\"That is so. Once we stood at the same place in time--in our thoughts,\nour desires. Now we stand at many places, as if we climbed a stairway,\neach at his own speed--a stairway the Pinda-lick-o-yi has set us upon.\nSome here, some there, some yet farther above....\" He sketched a series\nof step outlines in the air. \"And in this there is trouble--\"\n\n\"The truth,\" Travis agreed. \"Yet it is also true that I knew nothing of\nthis, that I climb with you on these stairs.\"\n\n\"So I believe. But there comes a time when it is best not to be a woman\nstirring a pot of boiling stew but rather one who stands quietly at a\ndistance--\"\n\n\"You mean?\" Travis pressed.\n\n\"I say that alone among us you have crossed the stars before, therefore\nnew things are not so hard to understand. And we need a scout. Also the\ncoyotes run in your footsteps, and you do not fear them.\"\n\nIt made good sense. Let him scout ahead of the party, taking the coyotes\nwith him. Stay away from the camp for a while and speak small--until the\npeople on Buck's stairway were more closely united.\n\n\"I go in the morning,\" Travis agreed. He could slip away tonight, but\njust now he could not force himself away from the fire, from the\ncompanionship.\n\n\"You might take Tsoay with you,\" Buck continued.\n\nTravis waited for him to enlarge on that suggestion. Tsoay was one of\nthe youngest of their group, Buck's own cross-cousin and near-brother.\n\n\"It is well,\" Buck explained, \"that we learn this land, and it has\nalways been our custom that the younger walk in the footprints of the\nolder. Also, not only should trails be learned, but also men.\"\n\nTravis caught the thought behind that. Perhaps by taking the younger men\nas scouts, one after another, he could build up among them a following\nof sorts. Among the Apaches, leadership was wholly a matter of\npersonality. Until the reservation days, chieftains had gained their\nposition by force of character alone, though they might come\nsuccessively from one family clan over several generations.\n\nHe did not want the chieftainship here. No, but neither did he want\ngrowing whispers working about him to cut him off from his people. To\nevery Apache severance from the clan was a little death. He must have\nthose who would back him if Deklay, or those who thought like Deklay,\nturned grumbling into open hostility.\n\n\"Tsoay is one quick to learn,\" Travis agreed. \"We go at dawn--\"\n\n\"Along the mountain range?\" Buck inquired.\n\n\"If we seek a protected place for the rancheria, yes. The mountains have\nalways provided good strongholds for the People.\"\n\n\"And you think there is need for a fort?\"\n\nTravis shrugged. \"I have been one day's journey out into this world. I\nsaw nothing but animals. But that is no promise that elsewhere there are\nno enemies. The planet was on the tapes we brought back from that other\nworld, and so it was known to the others who once rode between star and\nstar as we rode between ranch and town. If they had this world set on a\njourney tape, it was for a reason; that reason may still be in force.\"\n\n\"Yet it was long ago that these star people rode so....\" Buck mused.\n\"Would the reason last so long?\"\n\nTravis remembered two other worlds, one of weird desert inhabited by\nbeast things--or had they once been human, human to the point of\npossessing intelligence?--that had come out of sand burrows at night to\nattack a spaceship. And the second world where the ruins of a giant city\nhad stood choked with jungle vegetation, where he had made a blowgun\nfrom tubes of rustless metal as a weapon gift for small winged men--but\nwere they men? Both had been remnants of that ancient galactic empire.\n\n\"Some things could so remain,\" he answered soberly. \"If we find them, we\nmust be careful. But first a good site for the rancheria.\"\n\n\"There is no return to home for us,\" Buck stated flatly.\n\n\"Why do you say that? There could be a rescue ship later--\"\n\nThe other raised his eyes again to Travis. \"When you slept under the\nRedax how did you ride?\"\n\n\"As a warrior--raiding ... living....\"\n\n\"And I--I was one with _go'ndi_,\" Buck returned simply.\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"But the white man has assured us that such power--the power of a\nchief--does not exist? Yes, the Pinda-lick-o-yi has told us so many\nthings. He is busy, busy with his tools, his machines, always busy. And\nthose who think in another fashion cannot be measured by his rules, so\nthey are foolish dreamers. Not all white men think so. There was Dr.\nAshe--he was beginning to understand a little.\n\n\"Perhaps I, too, am standing still, halfway up the stairway of the past.\nBut of this I am very sure: For us, there will be no return to our own\nplace. And the time will come when something new shall grow from the\nseed of the past. Also it is necessary that you be one of the tenders of\nthat growth. So I urge you, take Tsoay, and the next time, Lupe. For the\nyoung who may be swayed this way and that by words--as the wind shakes a\nsmall tree--must be given firm roots.\"\n\nIn Travis education warred with instinct, just as the picture Redax had\nplanted in his mind had warred with his awaking to this alien landscape.\nYet now he believed he must be guided by what he felt. And he knew that\nno man of his race would claim _go'ndi_, the power of spirit known only\nto a great chief, unless he had actually felt it swell within him. It\nmight have been fostered by hallucination in the past, but the aura of\nit carried into the here and now. And Travis had no doubts that Buck\nbelieved implicitly in what he said, and that belief carried credulity\nto others.\n\n\"This is wisdom, _Nantan_--\"\n\nBuck shook his head. \"I am no _nantan_, no chief. But of some things I\nam sure. You also be sure of what lies within you, younger brother!\"\n\nOn the third day, ranging eastward along the base of the mountain range,\nTravis found what he believed would be an acceptable camp site. There\nwas a canyon with a good spring of water cut round by well-marked game\ntrails. A series of ledges brought him up to a small plateau where scrub\nwood could be used to build the wickiups. Water and food lay within\nreach, and the ledge approach was easy to defend. Even Deklay and his\nfellow malcontents were forced to concede the value of the site.\n\nHis duty to the clan accomplished, Travis returned to his own concern,\none which had haunted him for days. Topaz had been taped by men of the\nvanished star empire. Therefore, the planet was important, but why? As\nyet he had found no indication that anything above the intelligence\nlevel of the split horns was native to this world. But he was gnawed by\nthe certainty that there _was_ something here, waiting.... And the\ndesire to learn what it was became an ever-burning ache.\n\nPerhaps he was what Deklay had accused him of being, one who had come to\nfollow the road of the Pinda-lick-o-yi too closely. For Travis was\ncontent to scout with only the coyotes for company, and he did not find\nthe loneliness of the unknown planet as intimidating as most of the\nothers.\n\nHe was checking his small trail pack on the fourth day after they had\nsettled on the plateau when Buck and Jil-Lee hunkered down beside him.\n\n\"You go to hunt--?\" Buck broke the silence first.\n\n\"Not for meat.\"\n\n\"What do you fear? That _ndendai_--enemy people--have marked this as\ntheir land?\" Jil-Lee questioned.\n\n\"That may be true, but now I hunt for what this world was at one time,\nthe reason why the ancient star men marked it as their own.\"\n\n\"And this knowledge may be of value to us?\" Jil-Lee asked slowly. \"Will\nit bring food to our mouths, shelter for our bodies--mean life for us?\"\n\n\"All that is possible. It is the unknowing which is bad.\"\n\n\"True. Unknowing is always bad,\" Buck agreed. \"But the bow which is\nfitted to one hand and strength of arm, may not be suited to another.\nRemember that, younger brother. Also, do you go alone?\"\n\n\"With Naginlta and Nalik'ideyu I am not alone.\"\n\n\"Take Tsoay with you also. The four-footed ones are indeed _ga-n_ for\nthe service of those they like, but it is not good that man walks alone\nfrom his kind.\"\n\nThere it was again, the feeling of clan solidarity which Travis did not\nalways share. On the other hand, Tsoay would not be a hindrance. On\nother scouts the boy had proved to have a keen eye for the country and a\nliking for experimentation which was not a universal attribute even\namong those of his own age.\n\n\"I would go to find a path through the mountains; it may be a long\ntrail,\" Travis half protested.\n\n\"You believe what you seek may lie to the north?\"\n\nTravis shrugged. \"I do not know. How can I? But it will be another way\nof seeking.\"\n\n\"Tsoay shall go. He keeps silent before older warriors as is proper for\nthe untried, but his thoughts fly free as do yours,\" Buck replied. \"It\nis in him also, this need to see new places.\"\n\n\"There is this,\" Jil-Lee got to his feet, \"--do not go so far, brother,\nthat you may not easily find a way to return. This is a wide land, and\nwithin it we are but a handful of men alone----\"\n\n\"That, too, I know.\" Travis thought he could read more than one kind of\nwarning in Jil-Lee's words.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were the second day away from the plateau camp, and climbing, when\nthey chanced upon the pass Travis had hoped might exist. Before them lay\nan abrupt descent to what appeared to be open plains country cloaked in\na dusky amber Travis now knew was the thick grass found in the southern\nvalleys. Tsoay pointed with his chin.\n\n\"Wide land--good for horses, cattle, ranches....\"\n\nBut all those lay far beyond the black space surrounding them. Travis\nwondered if there was any native animal which could serve man in place\nof the horse.\n\n\"Do we go down?\" Tsoay asked.\n\nFrom this point Travis could sight no break far out on the amber plain,\nno sign of any building or any disturbance of its smooth emptiness. Yet\nit drew him. \"We go,\" he decided.\n\nClose as it had looked from the pass, the plain was yet a day and a\nnight, spent in careful watching by turns, ahead of them. It was\nmidmorning of the second day that they left the foothill breaks, and the\ngrass of the open country was waist high about them. Travis could see it\nrippling where the coyotes threaded ahead. Then he was conscious of a\npersistent buzzing, a noise which irritated faintly until he was\ncompelled to trace it to its source.\n\nThe grass had been trampled flat for an irregular patch, with a trail\nof broken stalks out of the heart of the plain. At one side was a\nbuzzing, seething mass of glitter-winged insects which Travis already\nknew as carrion eaters. They arose reluctantly from their feast as he\napproached.\n\nHe drew a short breath which was close to a grunt of astounded\nrecognition. What lay there was so impossible that he could not believe\nthe evidence of his eyes. Tsoay gave a sharp exclamation, went down on\none knee for a closer examination, then looked at Travis over his\nshoulder, his eyes wide, more than a trace of excitement in his voice.\n\n\"Horse dung--and fresh!\"\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\"There was one horse, unshod but ridden. It came here from the plains\nand it had been ridden hard, going lame. There was a rest here, maybe\nshortly after dawn.\" Travis sorted out what they had learned by a\ncareful examination of the ground.\n\nNalik'ideyu and Naginlta, Tsoay, watched and listened as if the coyotes\nas well as the boy could understand every word.\n\n\"There is that also--\" Tsoay indicated the one trace left by the unknown\nrider, an impression blurred as if some attempt had been made to conceal\nit.\n\n\"Small and light, the rider is both. Also in fear, I think--\"\n\n\"We follow?\" Tsoay asked.\n\n\"We follow,\" Travis assented. He looked to the coyotes, and as he had\nlearned to do, thought out his message. This trail was the one to be\nfollowed. When the rider was sighted they were to report back if the\nApaches had not yet caught up.\n\nThere was no visible agreement; the coyotes simply vanished through the\nwall of grass.\n\n\"Then there are others here,\" Tsoay said as he and Travis began their\nreturn to the foothills. \"Perhaps there was a second ship--\"\n\n\"That horse,\" Travis said, shaking his head. \"There was no provision in\nthe project for the shipping of horses.\"\n\n\"Perhaps they have always been here.\"\n\n\"Not so. To each world its own species of beasts. But we shall know the\ntruth when we look upon that horse--and its rider.\"\n\nIt was warmer this side of the mountains, and the heat of the plains\nbeat at them. Travis thought that the horse might well be seeking water\nif allowed his head. Where did he come from? And why had his rider gone\nin haste and fear?\n\nThis was rough, broken country and the tired, limping horse seemed to\nhave picked the easiest way through it, without any hindrance from the\nman with him. Travis spotted a soft patch of ground with a deep-set\nimpression. This time there had been no attempt at erasure; the boot\ntrack was plain. The rider had dismounted and was leading the horse--yet\nhe was moving swiftly.\n\nThey followed the tracks around the bend of a shallow cut and found\nNalik'ideyu waiting for them. Between her forefeet was a bundle still\ncovered with smears of soft earth, and behind her were drag marks from a\nhole under the overhang of a bush. The coyote had plainly just\ndisinterred her find. Travis squatted down to examine it, using his eyes\nbefore his hands.\n\nIt was a bag made of hide, probably the hide of one of the split horns\nby its color and the scraps of long hair which had been left in a\nsimple decorative fringe along the bottom. The sides had been laced\ntogether neatly by someone used to working in leather, the closing flap\nlashed down tightly with braided thong loops.\n\nAs the Apache leaned closer to it he could smell a mixture of odors--the\nhide itself, horse, wood smoke, and other scents--strange to him. He\nundid the fastenings and pulled out the contents.\n\nThere was a shirt, with long full sleeves, of a gray wool undyed from\nthe sheep. Then a very bulky short jacket which, after fingering it\ndoubtfully, Travis decided was made of felt. It was elaborately\ndecorated with highly colorful embroidery, and there was no mistaking\nthe design--a heavy antlered Terran deer in mortal combat with what\nmight be a puma. It was bordered with a geometric pattern of beautiful,\noddly familiar work. Travis smoothed it flat over his knee and tried to\nremember where he had seen its like before ... a book! An illustration\nin a book! But which book, when? Not recently, and it was not a pattern\nknown to his own people.\n\nTwisted into the interior of the jacket was a silklike scarf, clear,\nlight blue--the blue of Terra's cloudless skies on certain days, so\ndifferent from the yellow shield now hanging above them. A small case of\nleather, with silhouetted designs cut from hide and affixed to it,\ndesigns as intricate and complex as the embroidery on the jacket--art of\na high standard. In the case a knife and spoon, the bowl and blade of\ndull metal, the handles of horn carved with horse heads, the tiny\nwide-open eyes set with glittering stones.\n\nPersonal possessions dear to the owner, so that when they must be\nabandoned for flight they were hidden with some hope of recovery. Travis\nslowly repacked them, trying to fold the garments into their original\ncreases. He was still puzzled by those designs.\n\n\"Who?\" Tsoay touched the edge of the jacket with one finger, his\nadmiration for it plain to read.\n\n\"I don't know. But it is of our own world.\"\n\n\"That is a deer, though the horns are wrong,\" Tsoay agreed. \"And the\npuma is very well done. The one who made this knows animals well.\"\n\nTravis pushed the jacket back into the bag and laced it shut. But he did\nnot return it to the hiding place. Instead, he made it a part of his own\npack. If they did not succeed in running down the fugitive, he wanted an\nopportunity for closer study, a chance to remember just where he had\nseen that picture before.\n\nThe narrow valley where they had discovered the bag sloped upward, and\nthere were signs that their quarry found the ground harder to cover. The\nsecond discard lay in open sight--again a leather bag which Nalik'ideyu\nsniffed and then began to lick eagerly, thrusting her nose into its\nflaccid interior.\n\nTravis picked it up, finding it damp to the touch. It had an odd smell,\nlike that of sour milk. He ran a finger around inside, brought it out\nwet; yet this was neither water bag nor canteen. And he was completely\nmystified when he turned it inside out, for though the inner surface was\nwet, the bag was empty. He offered it to the coyote, and she took it\npromptly.\n\nHolding it firmly to the earth with her forepaws, she licked the\nsurface, though Travis could see no deposit which might attract her. It\nwas clear that the bag had once held some sort of food.\n\n\"Here they rested,\" Tsoay said. \"Not too far ahead now--\"\n\nBut now they were in the kind of country where a man could hide in order\nto check on his back trail. Travis studied the terrain and then made his\nown plans. They would leave the plainly marked trace of the fugitive,\nstrike out upslope to the east and try to parallel the other's route. In\nthat maze of rock outcrops and wood copses there was tricky going.\n\nNalik'ideyu gave a last lick to the bag as Travis signaled her. She\nregarded him, then turned her head to survey the country before them. At\nlast she trotted on, her buff coat melting into the vegetation. With\nNaginlta she would scout the quarry and keep watch, leaving the men to\ntake the longer way around.\n\nTravis pulled off his shirt, folding it into a packet and tucking it\nbeneath the folds of his sash-belt, just as his ancestors had always\ndone before a fight. Then he cached his pack and Tsoay's. As they began\nthe stiff climb they carried only their bows, the quivers slung on their\nshoulders, and the long-bladed knives. But they flitted like shadows\nand, like the coyotes, their red-brown bodies became indistinguishable\nagainst the bronze of the land.\n\nThey should be, Travis judged, not more than an hour away from sundown.\nAnd they had to locate the stranger before the dark closed in. His\nrespect for their quarry had grown. The unknown might have been driven\nby fear, but he held to a good pace and headed intelligently for just\nthe kind of country which would serve him best. If Travis could only\nremember where he had seen the like of that embroidery! It had a\nmeaning which might be important now....\n\nTsoay slipped behind a wind-gnarled tree and disappeared. Travis stooped\nunder a line of bush limbs. Both were working their way south, using the\npeak ahead as an agreed landmark, pausing at intervals to examine the\nlandscape for any hint of a man and horse.\n\nTravis squirmed snake fashion into an opening between two rock pillars\nand lay there, the westering sun hot on his bare shoulders and back, his\nchin propped on his forearm. In the band holding back his hair he had\ninserted some concealing tufts of wiry mountain grass, the ends of which\ndrooped over his rugged features.\n\nOnly seconds earlier he had caught that fragmentary warning from one of\nthe coyotes. What they sought was very close, it was right down there.\nBoth animals were in ambush, awaiting orders. And what they found was\nfamiliar, another confirmation that the fugitive was Terran, not native\nto Topaz.\n\nWith searching eyes, Travis examined the site indicated by the coyotes.\nHis respect for the stranger was raised another notch. In time either he\nor Tsoay might have sighted that hideaway without the aid of the animal\nscouts; on the other hand, they might have failed. For the fugitive had\ntruly gone to earth, using some pocket or crevice in the mountain wall.\n\nThere was no sign of the horse, but a branch here and there had been\npulled out of place, the scars of their removal readable when one knew\nwhere to look. Odd, Travis began to puzzle over what he saw. It was\nalmost as if whatever pursuit the stranger feared would come not at\nground level but from above; the precautions the stranger had taken were\nto veil his retreat to the reaches of the mountain side.\n\nHad he expected any trailer to make a flanking move from up that slope\nwhere the Apaches now lay? Travis' teeth nipped the weathered skin of\nhis forearm. Could it be that at some time during the day's journeying\nthe fugitive had doubled back, having seen his trackers? But there had\nbeen no traces of any such scouting, and the coyotes would surely have\nwarned them. Human eyes and ears could be tricked, but Travis trusted\nthe senses of Naginlta and Nalik'ideyu far above his own.\n\nNo, he did not believe that the rider expected the Apaches. But the man\ndid expect someone or something which would come upon him from the\nheights. The heights.... Travis rolled his head slightly to look at the\nupper reaches of the hills about him--with suspicion.\n\nIn their own journey across the mountains and through the pass they had\nfound nothing threatening. Dangerous animals might roam there. There had\nbeen some paw marks, one such trail the coyotes had warned against. But\nthe type of precautions the stranger had taken were against intelligent,\nthinking beings, not against animals more likely to track by scent than\nby sight.\n\nAnd if the stranger expected an attack from above, then Travis and Tsoay\nmust be alert. Travis analyzed each feature of the hillside, setting in\nhis mind a picture of every inch of ground they must cross. Just as he\nhad wanted daylight as an ally before, so now was he willing to wait for\nthe shadows of twilight.\n\nHe closed his eyes in a final check, able to recall the details of the\nhiding place, knowing that he could reach it when the conditions\nfavored, without mistake. Then he edged back from his vantage point, and\nraising his fingers to his lips, made a small angry chittering, three\ntimes repeated. One of the species inhabiting these heights, as they had\nnoted earlier, was a creature about as big as the palm of a man's hand,\nresembling nothing so much as a round ball of ruffled feathers, though\nits covering might actually have been a silky, fluffy fur. Its short\nlegs could cover ground at an amazing speed, and it had the bold\nimpudence of a creature with few natural enemies. This was its usual\ncry.\n\nTsoay's hand waved Travis on to where the younger man had taken position\nbehind the bleached trunk of a fallen tree.\n\n\"He hides,\" Tsoay whispered.\n\n\"Against trouble from above.\" Travis added his own observation.\n\n\"But not us, I think.\"\n\nSo Tsoay had come to that conclusion too? Travis tried to gauge the\nnearness of twilight. There was a period after the passing of Topaz' sun\nwhen the dusky light played odd tricks with shadows. That would be the\nfirst time for their move. He said as much, and Tsoay nodded eagerly.\nThey sat with their backs to a boulder, the tree trunk serving as a\nscreen, and chewed methodically on ration tablets. There was energy and\nsustenance in the tasteless squares which would support men, even though\ntheir stomachs continued to demand the satisfaction of fresh meat.\n\nTaking turns, they dozed a little. But the last banners of Topaz' sun\nwere still in the sky when Travis judged the shadows cover enough. He\nhad no way of knowing how the stranger was armed. Though he used a horse\nfor transportation, he might well carry a rifle and the most modern\nTerran sidearms.\n\nThe Apaches' bows were little use for infighting, but they had their\nknives. However, Travis wanted to take the fugitive unharmed if he\ncould. There was information he must have. So he did not even draw his\nknife as he started downhill.\n\nWhen he reached a pool of violet dusk at the bottom of the small ravine\nNaginlta's eyes regarded him knowingly. Travis signaled with his hand\nand thought out what would be the coyotes' part in this surprise attack.\nThe prick-eared silhouette vanished. Uphill the chitter of a fluff-fur\nsounded twice--Tsoay was in position.\n\nA howl ... wailing ... sobbing ... was heard, one of the keening songs\nof the _mba'a_. Travis darted forward. He heard the nicker of a\nfrightened horse, a clicking which could have marked the pawing of hoof\non gravel, saw the brush hiding the stranger's hole tremble, a portion\nof it fall away.\n\nTravis sped on, his moccasins making no sound on the ground. One of the\ncoyotes gave tongue for the second time, the eerie wailing rising to a\nyapping which echoed from the rocks about them. Travis poised for a\ndive.\n\nAnother section of those artfully heaped branches had given way and a\nhorse reared, its upflung head plainly marked against the sky. A blurred\nfigure weaved back and forth before it, trying to control the mount. The\nstranger had his hands full, certainly no weapon drawn--this was it!\n\nTravis leaped. His hands found their mark, the shoulders of the\nstranger. There was a shrill cry from the other as he tried to turn in\nthe Apache's hold, to face his attacker. But Travis bore them both on,\nrolling almost under the feet of the horse, sliding downhill, the\nunknown's writhing body pinned down by the Apache's weight and his\nclasp, tight as an iron grip, about the other's chest and upper arms.\n\nHe felt his opponent go limp, but was suspicious enough not to release\nthat hold, for the heavy breathing of the stranger was not that of an\nunconscious man. They lay so, the unknown still tight in Travis' hold\nbut no longer fighting. The Apache could hear Tsoay soothing the horse\nwith the purring words of a practiced horseman.\n\nStill the stranger did not resume the struggle. They could not lie in\nthis position all night, Travis thought with a wry twist of amusement.\nHe shifted his hold, and got the lightning-quick response he had\nexpected. But it was not quite quick enough, for Travis had the other's\nhands behind his back, cupping slender, almost delicate wrists together.\n\n\"Throw me a cord!\" he called to Tsoay.\n\nThe younger man ran up with an extra bow cord, and in a moment they had\nbonds on the struggling captive. Travis rolled their catch over,\nreaching down for a fistful of hair to pull the head into a patch of\nclearer light.\n\nIn his grasp that hair came loose, a braid unwinding. He grunted as he\nlooked down into the stranger's face. Dust marks were streaked now with\ntear runnels, but the gray eyes which turned fiercely on him said that\ntheir owner cried more in rage than fear.\n\nHis captive might be wearing long trousers tucked into curved, toed\nboots, and a loose overblouse, but she was certainly not only a woman,\nbut a very young and attractive one. Also, at the present moment, an\nexceedingly angry one. And behind that anger was fear, the fear of one\nfighting hopelessly against insurmountable odds. But as she eyed Travis\nnow her expression changed.\n\nHe felt she had expected another captor altogether and was astounded at\nthe sight of him. Her tongue touched her lips, moistening them, and now\nthe fear in her was another kind--the wary fear of one facing a totally\nnew and perhaps dangerous thing.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Travis spoke in English, for he had no doubts that she\nwas Terran.\n\nNow she sucked in her breath with a gasp of pure astonishment.\n\n\"Who are _you_?\" she parroted his question in a marked accent. English\nwas not her native tongue, he was sure.\n\nTravis reached out, and again his hands closed on her shoulders. She\nstarted to twist and then realized he was merely pulling her up to a\nsitting position. Some of the fear had left her eyes, an intent interest\ntaking its place.\n\n\"You are not Sons of the Blue Wolf,\" she stated in her heavily accented\nspeech.\n\nTravis smiled. \"I am the Fox, not the Wolf,\" he returned. \"And the\nCoyote is my brother.\" He snapped his fingers at the shadows, and the\ntwo animals came noiselessly into sight. Her gaze widened even more at\nNaginlta and Nalik'ideyu, and she deduced the bond which must exist\nbetween her captor and the beasts.\n\n\"This woman is also of our world.\" Tsoay spoke in Apache, looking over\ntheir prisoner with frank interest. \"Only she is not of the People.\"\n\nSons of the Blue Wolf? Travis thought again of the embroidery designs on\nthe jacket. Who had called themselves by that picturesque\ntitle--where--and when in time?\n\n\"What do you fear, Daughter of the Blue Wolf?\" he asked.\n\nAnd with that question he seemed to touch some button activating terror.\nShe flung back her head so that she could see the darkening sky.\n\n\"The flyer!\" Her voice was muted as if more than a whisper would carry\nto the stars just coming into brilliance above them. \"They will come ...\ntracking. I did not reach the inner mountains in time.\"\n\nThere was a despairing note in that which cut through to Travis, who\nfound that he, too, was searching the sky, not knowing what he looked\nfor or what kind of menace it promised, only that it was real danger.\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\"The night comes,\" Tsoay spoke slowly in English. \"Do these you fear\nhunt in the dark?\"\n\nShe shook her head to free her forehead from a coil of braid, pulled\nloose in her struggle with Travis.\n\n\"They do not need eyes or such noses as those four-footed hunters of\nyours. They have a machine to track--\"\n\n\"Then what purpose is this brush pile of yours?\" Travis raised his chin\nat the disturbed hiding place.\n\n\"They do not constantly use the machine, and one can hope. But at night\nthey can ride on its beam. We are not far enough into the hills to lose\nthem. Bahatur went lame, and so I was slowed....\"\n\n\"And what lies in these mountains that those you fear dare not invade\nthem?\" Travis continued.\n\n\"I do not know, save if one can climb far enough inside, one is safe\nfrom pursuit.\"\n\n\"I ask it again: Who are you?\" The Apache leaned forward, his face in\nthe fast-fading light now only inches away from hers. She did not shrink\nfrom his close scrutiny but met him eye to eye. This was a woman of\nproud independence, truly a chief's daughter, Travis decided.\n\n\"I am of the People of the Blue Wolf. We were brought across the star\nlanes to make this world safe for ... for ... the....\" She hesitated,\nand now there was a shade of puzzlement on her face. \"There is a\nreason--a dream. No, there is the dream and there is reality. I am\nKaydessa of the Golden Horde, but sometimes I remember other\nthings--like this speech of strange words I am mouthing now----\"\n\n\"The Golden Horde!\" Travis knew now. The embroidery, Sons of the Blue\nWolf, all fitted into a special pattern. But what a pattern! Scythian\nart, the ornament that the warriors of Genghis Khan bore so proudly.\nTatars, Mongols--the barbarians who had swept from the fastness of the\nsteppes to change the course of history, not only in Asia but across the\nplains of middle Europe. The men of the Emperor Khans who had ridden\nbehind the yak-tailed standards of Genghis Khan, Kublai Khan,\nTamerlane--!\n\n\"The Golden Horde,\" Travis repeated once again. \"That lies far back in\nthe history of another world, Wolf Daughter.\"\n\nShe stared at him, a queer, lost expression on her dust-grimed face.\n\n\"I know.\" Her voice was so muted he could hardly distinguish the words.\n\"My people live in two times, and many do not realize that.\"\n\nTsoay had crouched down beside them to listen. Now he put out his hand,\ntouching Travis' shoulder.\n\n\"Redax?\"\n\n\"Or its like.\" For Travis was sure of one point. The project, which had\nbeen training three teams for space colonization--one of Eskimos, one of\nPacific Islanders, and one of his own Apaches--had no reason or chance\nto select Mongols from the wild past of the raiding Hordes. There was\nonly one nation on Terra which could have picked such colonists.\n\n\"You are Russian.\" He studied her carefully, intent on noting the effect\nof his words.\n\nBut she did not lose that lost look. \"Russian ... Russian ...\" she\nrepeated, as if the very word was strange.\n\nTravis was alarmed. Any Russian colony planted here could well possess\ntechnicians with machines capable of tracking a fugitive, and if\nmountain heights were protection against such a hunt, he intended to\ngain them, even by night traveling. He said this to Tsoay, and the other\nemphatically agreed.\n\n\"The horse is too lame to go on,\" the younger man reported.\n\nTravis hesitated for a long second. Since the time they had stolen their\nfirst mounts from the encroaching Spanish, horses had always been wealth\nto his people. To leave an animal which could well serve the clan was\nnot right. But they dared not waste time with a lame beast.\n\n\"Leave it here, free,\" he ordered.\n\n\"And the woman?\"\n\n\"She goes with us. We must learn all we can of these people and what\nthey do here. Listen, Wolf Daughter,\" again Travis leaned close to make\nsure she was listening to him as he spoke with emphasis--\"you will\ntravel with us into these high places, and there will be no trouble from\nyou.\" He drew his knife and held the blade warningly before her eyes.\n\n\"It was already in my mind to go to the mountains,\" she told him evenly.\n\"Untie my hands, brave warrior, you have surely nothing to fear from a\nwoman.\"\n\nHis hand made a swift sweep and plucked a knife as long and keen as his\nfrom the folds of the sash beneath her loose outer garment.\n\n\"Not now, Wolf Daughter, since I have drawn your fangs.\"\n\nHe helped her to her feet and slashed the cord about her wrists with her\nknife, which he then fastened to his own belt. Alerting the coyotes, he\ndispatched them ahead; and the three started on, the Mongol girl between\nthe two Apaches. The abandoned horse nickered lonesomely and then began\nto graze on tufts of grass, moving slowly to favor his foot.\n\nThe two moons rode the sky as the hours advanced, their beams fighting\nthe shadows. Travis felt reasonably safe from any attack at ground\nlevel, depending upon the coyotes for warning. But he held them all to a\nsteady pace. And he did not question the girl again until all three of\nthem hunkered down at a small mountain spring, to dash icy water over\ntheir faces and drink from cupped hands.\n\n\"Why do you flee your own people, Wolf Daughter?\"\n\n\"My name is Kaydessa,\" she corrected him.\n\nHe chuckled with laughter at the prim tone of her voice. \"And you see\nhere Tsoay of the People--the Apaches--while I am Fox.\" He was giving\nher the English equivalent of his tribal name.\n\n\"Apaches.\" She tried to repeat the word with the same accent he had\nused. \"And what are Apaches?\"\n\n\"Indians--Amerindians,\" he explained. \"But you have not answered my\nquestion, Kaydessa. Why do you run from your own people?\"\n\n\"Not from my people,\" she said, shaking her head determinedly. \"From\nthose others. It is like this--Oh, how can I make you understand\nrightly?\" She spread her wet hands out before her in the moonlight, the\ndamp patches on her sleeves clinging to her arms. \"There are my people\nof the Golden Horde, though once we were different and we can remember\nbits of that previous life. Then there are also the men who live in the\nsky ship and use the machine so that we think only the thoughts they\nwould have us think. Now why,\" she looked at Travis intently--\"do I wish\nto tell you all this? It is strange. You say you are\nIndian--American--are we then enemies? There is a part memory which says\nthat we are ... were....\"\n\n\"Let us rather say,\" he corrected her, \"that the Apaches and the Horde\nare not enemies here and now, no matter what was before.\" That was the\ntruth, Travis recognized. By all accounts his people had come out of\nAsia in the very dim beginnings of migrating peoples. For all her\ndark-red hair and gray eyes, this girl who had been arbitrarily returned\nto a past just as they had been by Redax, could well be a distant\nclan-cousin.\n\n\"You--\" Kaydessa's fingers rested for a moment on his wrist--\"you, too,\nwere sent here from across the stars. Is this not so?\"\n\n\"It is so.\"\n\n\"And there are those here who govern you now?\"\n\n\"No. We are free.\"\n\n\"How did you become free?\" she demanded fiercely.\n\nTravis hesitated. He did not want to tell of the wrecked ship, the fact\nthat his people possessed no real defenses against the\nRussian-controlled colony.\n\n\"We went to the mountains,\" he replied evasively.\n\n\"Your governing machine failed?\" Kaydessa laughed. \"Ah, they are so\ngreat, those men of the machines. But they are smaller and weaker when\ntheir machines cannot obey them.\"\n\n\"It is so with your camp?\" Travis probed gently. He was not quite sure\nof her meaning, but he dared not ask more detailed questions without\ndangerously revealing his own ignorance.\n\n\"In some manner their control machine--it can only work upon those\nwithin a certain distance. They discovered that in the days of the first\nlanding, when hunters went out freely and many of them did not return.\nAfter that when hunters were sent out to learn how lay this land, they\nwent along in the flyer with a machine so that there would be no more\nescapes. But we knew!\" Kaydessa's fingers curled into small fists. \"Yes,\nwe knew that if we could get beyond the machines, there was freedom for\nus. And we planned--many of us--planned. Then nine or ten sleeps ago\nthose others were very excited. They gathered in their ship, watching\ntheir machines. And something happened. For a while all those machines\nwent dead.\n\n\"Jagatai, Kuchar, my brother Hulagur, Menlik....\" She was counting the\nnames off on her fingers. \"They raided the horse herd, rode out....\"\n\n\"And you?\"\n\n\"I, too, should have ridden. But there was Aljar, my sister--Kuchar's\nwife. She was very near her time and to ride thus, fleeing and fast,\nmight kill her and the child. So I did not go. Her son was born that\nnight, but the others had the machine at work once more. We might long\nto go here,\" she brought her fist up to her breast, and then raised it\nto her head--\"but there was that _here_ which kept us to the camp and\ntheir will. We only knew that if we could reach the mountains, we might\nfind our people who had already gained their freedom.\"\n\n\"But you are here. How did you escape?\" Tsoay wanted to know.\n\n\"They knew that I would have gone had it not been for Aljar. So they\nsaid they would make her ride out with them unless I played guide to\nlead them to my brother and the others. Then I knew I must take up the\nsword of duty and hunt with them. But I prayed that the spirits of the\nupper air look with favor upon me, and they granted aid....\" Her eyes\nheld a look of wonder. \"For when we were out on the plains and well away\nfrom the settlement, a grass devil attacked the leader of the searching\nparty, and he dropped the mind control and so it was broken. Then I\nrode. Blue Sky Above knows how I rode. And those others are not with\ntheir horses as are the people of the Wolf.\"\n\n\"When did this happen?\"\n\n\"Three suns ago.\"\n\nTravis counted back in his mind. Her date for the failure of the machine\nin the Russian camp seemed to coincide with the crash landing of the\nAmerican ship. Had one thing any connection with the other? It was very\npossible. The planeting spacer might have fought some kind of weird duel\nwith the other colony before it plunged to earth on the other side of\nthe mountain range.\n\n\"Do you know where in these mountains your people hide?\"\n\nKaydessa shook her head. \"Only that I must head south, and when I reach\nthe highest peak make a signal fire on the north slope. But that I\ncannot do now, for those in the flyer may see it. I know they are on my\ntrail, for twice I have seen it. Listen, Fox, I ask this of you--I,\nKaydessa, who am eldest daughter to the Khan--for you are like unto us,\na warrior and a brave man, that I believe. It may be that you cannot be\ngoverned by their machine, for you have not rested under their spell,\nnor are of our blood. Therefore, if they come close enough to send forth\nthe call, the call I must obey as if I were a slave dragged upon a horse\nrope, then do you bind my hands and feet and hold me here, no matter how\nmuch I struggle to follow that command. For that which is truly me does\nnot want to go. Will you swear this by the fires which expel demons?\"\n\nThe utter sincerity of her tone convinced Travis that she was pleading\nfor aid against a danger she firmly believed in. Whether she was right\nabout his immunity to the Russian mental control was another matter, and\none he would rather not put to the test.\n\n\"We do not swear by your fires, Blue Wolf Maiden, but by the Path of the\nLightning.\" His fingers moved as if to curl about the sacred charred\nwood his people had once carried as \"medicine.\" \"So do I promise!\"\n\nShe looked at him for a long moment and then nodded in satisfaction.\n\nThey left the pool and pushed on toward the mountain slopes, working\ntheir way back to the pass. A low growl out of the dark brought them to\nan instant halt. Naginlta's warning was sharp; there was danger ahead,\nacute danger.\n\nThe moonlight from the moons made a weird pattern of light and dark on\nthe stretch ahead. Anything from a slinking four-footed hunter to a war\nparty of intelligent beings might have been lying in wait there.\n\nA flitting shadow out of shadows. Nalik'ideyu pressed against Travis'\nlegs, making a barrier of her warm body, attracting his attention to a\nspot at the left perhaps a hundred yards on. There was a great splotch\nof dark there, large enough to hide a really formidable opponent; that\nwordless communication between animal and man told Travis that such an\nopponent was just what was lurking there.\n\nWhatever lay in ambush beside the upper track was growing impatient as\nits destined prey ceased to advance, the coyotes reported.\n\n\"Your left--beyond that pointed rock--in the big shadow--\"\n\n\"Do you see it?\" Tsoay demanded.\n\n\"No. But the _mba'a_ do.\"\n\nThe men had their bows ready, arrows set to the cords. But in this light\nsuch weapons were practically useless unless the enemy moved into the\npath of the moon.\n\n\"What is it?\" Kaydessa asked in a half whisper.\n\n\"Something waits for us ahead.\"\n\nBefore he could stop her, she set her fingers to her lips and gave a\npiercing whistle.\n\nThere was answering movement in the shadow. Travis shot at that, his\narrow followed instantly by one from Tsoay. There was a cry, scaling up\nin a throat-scalding scream which made Travis flinch. Not because of\nthe sound, but because of the hint which lay behind it--could it have\nbeen a human cry?\n\nThe thing flopped out into a patch of moonlight. It was four-limbed, its\nbody silvery--and it was large. But the worst was that it had been\ngroveling on all fours when it fell, and now it was rising on its hind\nfeet, one forepaw striking madly at the two arrows dancing head-deep in\nits upper shoulder. Man? No! But something sufficiently manlike to chill\nthe three downtrail.\n\nA whirling four-footed hunter dashed in, snapped at the creature's legs,\nand it squalled again, aiming a blow with a forepaw; but the attacking\ncoyote was already gone. Together Naginlta and Nalik'ideyu were\nharassing the creature, just as they had fought the split horn, giving\nthe hunters time to shoot. Travis, although he again felt that touch of\nhorror and disgust he could not account for, shot again.\n\nBetween them the Apaches must have sent a dozen arrows into the raving\nbeast before it went to its knees and Naginlta sprang for its throat.\nEven then the coyote yelped and flinched, a bleeding gash across its\nhead from the raking talons of the dying thing. When it no longer moved,\nTravis approached to see more closely what they had brought down. That\nsmell....\n\nJust as the embroidery on Kaydessa's jacket had awakened memories from\nhis Terran past, so did this stench remind him of something.\nWhere--when--had he smelled it before? Travis connected it with dark,\ndark and danger. Then he gasped in a half exclamation.\n\nNot on this world, no, but on two others: two worlds of that broken\nstellar empire where he had been an involuntary explorer two planet\nyears ago! The beast things which had lived in the dark of the desert\nworld the Terrans' wandering galactic derelict had landed upon. Yes, the\nbeast things whose nature they had never been able to deduce. Were they\nthe degenerate dregs of a once intelligent species? Or were they\nanimals, akin to man, but still animals?\n\nThe ape-things had controlled the night of the desert world. And they\nhad been met again--also in the dark--in the ruins of the city which had\nbeen the final goal of the ship's taped voyage. So they were a part of\nthe vanished civilization. And Travis' own vague surmise concerning\nTopaz was proven correct. This had not been an empty world for the\nlong-gone space people. This planet had a purpose and a use, or else\nthis beast would not have been here.\n\n\"Devil!\" Kaydessa made a face of disgust.\n\n\"You know it?\" Tsoay asked Travis. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"That I do not know, but it is a thing left over from the star people's\ntime. And I have seen it on two other of their worlds.\"\n\n\"A man?\" Tsoay surveyed the body critically. \"It wears no clothes, has\nno weapons, but it walks erect. It looks like an ape, a very big ape. It\nis not a good thing, I think.\"\n\n\"If it runs with a pack--as they do elsewhere--this could be a very bad\nthing.\" Travis, remembering how these creatures had attacked in force on\nthe other worlds, looked about him apprehensively. Even with the coyotes\non guard, they could not stand up to such a pack closing in through the\ndark. They had better hole up in some defendable place and wait out the\nrest of the night.\n\nNaginlta brought them to a cliff overhang where they could set their\nbacks to the hard rock of the mountain, face outward to a space they\ncould cover with arrow flight if the need arose. And the coyotes, lying\nbefore them with their noses resting on paws, would, Travis knew, alert\nthem long before the enemy could close in.\n\nThey huddled against the rock, Kaydessa between them, alert at first to\nevery sound of the night, their hearts beating faster at a small scrape\nof gravel, the rustle of a bush. Slowly, they began to relax.\n\n\"It is well that two sleep while one guards,\" Travis observed. \"By\nmorning we must push on, out of this country.\"\n\nSo the two Apaches shared the watch in turn, the Tatar girl at first\nprotesting, and then falling exhausted into a slumber which left her\nbreathing heavily.\n\nTravis, on the dawn watch, began to speculate about the ape-thing they\nhad killed. The two previous times he had met this creature it had been\nin ruins of the old empire. Were there ruins somewhere here? He wanted\nto make sure about that. On the other hand, there was the problem of the\nTatar-Mongol settlement controlled by the Reds. There was no doubt in\nhis mind that, were the Reds to suspect the existence of the Apache\ncamp, they would make every attempt to hunt down and kill or capture the\nsurvivors from the American ship. A warning must be carried to the\nrancheria as quickly as they could make the return trip.\n\nBeside him the girl stirred, raising her head. Travis glanced at her and\nthen watched with attention. She was looking straight ahead, her eyes as\nfixed as if she were in a trance. Now she inched forward from the\nmountain wall, wriggling out of its shelter.\n\n\"What--?\" Tsoay had awakened again. But Travis was already moving. He\npushed on, rushing up to stand beside her, shoulder to shoulder.\n\n\"What is it? Where do you go?\" he asked.\n\nShe made no answer, did not even seem aware of his voice. He caught at\nher arm and she pulled to free herself. When he tightened his grip she\ndid not fight him actively as during their first encounter, but merely\npulled and twisted as if she were being compelled to go ahead.\n\nCompulsion! He remembered her plea the night before, asking his help\nagainst recapture by the machine. Now he deliberately tripped her,\ntwisted her hands behind her back. She swayed in his hold, trying to win\nto her feet, paying no attention to him save as a hindrance against her\nanswering that demanding call he could not hear.\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\"What happened?\" Tsoay took a swift stride, stood over the writhing girl\nwhose strength was now such that Travis had to exert all his efforts to\ncontrol her.\n\n\"I think that the machine she spoke about is holding her. She is being\ndrawn to it out of hiding as one draws a calf on a rope.\"\n\nBoth coyotes had arisen and were watching the struggle with interest,\nbut there was no warning from them. Whatever called Kaydessa into such\nmindless and will-less answer did not touch the animals. And neither\nApache felt it. So perhaps only Kaydessa's people were subject to it, as\nshe had thought. How far away was that machine? Not too near, for\notherwise the coyotes would have traced the man or men operating it.\n\n\"We cannot move her,\" Tsoay brought the problem into the open--\"unless\nwe bind and carry her. She is one of their kind. Why not let her go to\nthem, unless you fear she will talk.\" His hand went to the knife in his\nbelt, and Travis knew what primitive impulse moved in the younger man.\n\nIn the old days a captive who was likely to give trouble was\nefficiently eliminated. In Tsoay that memory was awake now. Travis shook\nhis head.\n\n\"She has said that others of her kin are in these hills. We must not set\ntwo wolf packs hunting us,\" Travis said, giving the more practical\nreason which might better appeal to that savage instinct for\nself-preservation. \"But you are right, since she has tried to answer\nthis summons, we cannot force her with us. Therefore, do you take the\nback trail. Tell Buck what we have discovered and have him make the\nnecessary precautions against either these Mongol outlaws or a Red\nthrust over the mountains.\"\n\n\"And you?\"\n\n\"I stay to discover where the outlaws hide and learn all I can of this\nsettlement. We may have reason to need friends----\"\n\n\"Friends!\" Tsoay spat. \"The People need no friends! If we have warning,\nwe can hold our own country! As the Pinda-lick-o-yi have discovered\nbefore.\"\n\n\"Bows and arrows against guns and machines?\" Travis inquired bitingly.\n\"We must know more before we make any warrior boasts for the future.\nTell Buck what we have discovered. Also say I will join you before,\"\nTravis calculated--\"ten suns. If I do not, send no search party; the\nclan is too small to risk more lives for one.\"\n\n\"And if these Reds take you--?\"\n\nTravis grinned, not pleasantly. \"They shall learn nothing! Can their\nmachines sort out the thoughts of a dead man?\" He did not intend his\nfuture to end as abruptly as that, but also he would not be easy meat\nfor any Red hunting party.\n\nTsoay took a share of their rations and refused the company of the\ncoyotes. Travis realized that for all his seeming ease with the animals,\nthe younger scout had little more liking for them than Deklay and the\nothers back at the rancheria. Tsoay went at dawn, aiming at the pass.\n\nTravis sat down beside Kaydessa. They had bound her to a small tree, and\nshe strove incessantly to free herself, turning her head at an acute and\npainful angle, only to face the same direction in which she had been\ntied. There was no breaking the spell which held her. And she would soon\nwear herself out with that struggling. Then he struck an expert blow.\n\nThe girl sagged limply, and he untied her. It all depended now on the\nrange of the beam or broadcast of that diabolical machine. From the\nattitude of the coyotes, he assumed that those using the machine had not\nmade any attempt to come close. They might not even know where their\nquarry was; they would simply sit and wait in the foothills for the\ncaller to reel in a helpless captive.\n\nTravis thought that if he moved Kaydessa farther away from that point,\nsooner or later they would be out of range and she would awake from the\nknockout, free again. Although she was not light, he could manage to\ncarry her for a while. So burdened, Travis started on, with the coyotes\nscouting ahead.\n\nHe speedily discovered that he had set himself an ambitious task. The\ngoing was rough, and carrying the girl reduced his advance to a\nsnail-paced crawl. But it gave him time to make careful plans.\n\nAs long as the Reds held the balance of power on this side of the\nmountain range, the rancheria was in danger. Bows and knives against\nmodern armament was no contest at all. And it would only be a matter of\ntime before exploration on the part of the northern settlement--or some\ntracking down of Tatar fugitives--would bring the enemy across the pass.\n\nThe Apaches could move farther south into the unknown continent below\nthe wrecked ship, thus prolonging the time before they were discovered.\nBut that would only postpone the inevitable showdown. Whether Travis\ncould make his clan believe that, was also a matter of concern.\n\nOn the other hand, if the Red overlords could be met in some practical\nway.... Travis' mind fastened on that more attractive idea, worrying it\nas Naginlta worried a prey, tearing out and devouring the more delicate\nportions. Every bit of sense and prudence argued against such an\napproach, whose success could rest only between improbability and\nimpossibility; yet that was the direction in which he longed to move.\n\nAcross his shoulder Kaydessa stirred and moaned. The Apache doubled his\nefforts to reach the outcrop of rock he could see ahead, chiseled into\nhigh relief by the winds. In its lee they would have protection from any\nsighting from below. Panting, he made it, lowering the girl into the\nguarded cup of space, and waited.\n\nShe moaned again, lifted one hand to her head. Her eyes were half open,\nand still he could not be sure whether they focused on him and her\nsurroundings intelligently or not.\n\n\"Kaydessa!\"\n\nHer heavy eyelids lifted, and he had no doubt she could see him. But\nthere was no recognition of his identity in her gaze, only surprise and\nfear--the same expression she had worn during their first meeting in the\nfoothills.\n\n\"Daughter of the Wolf,\" he spoke slowly. \"Remember!\" Travis made that an\norder, an emphatic appeal to the mind under the influence of the caller.\n\nShe frowned, the struggle she was making naked on her face. Then she\nanswered:\n\n\"You--Fox--\"\n\nTravis grunted with relief, his alarm subsiding. Then she _could_\nremember.\n\n\"Yes,\" he responded eagerly.\n\nBut she was gazing about, her puzzlement growing. \"Where is this--?\"\n\n\"We are higher in the mountains.\"\n\nNow fear was pushing out bewilderment. \"How did I come here?\"\n\n\"I brought you.\" Swiftly he outlined what had happened at their night\ncamp.\n\nThe hand which had been at her head was now pressed tight across her\nlips as if she were biting furiously into its flesh to still some panic\nof her own, and her gray eyes were round and haunted.\n\n\"You are free now,\" Travis said.\n\nKaydessa nodded, and then dropped her hand to speak. \"You brought me\naway from the hunters. You did not have to obey them?\"\n\n\"I heard nothing.\"\n\n\"You do not hear--you feel!\" She shuddered. \"Please.\" She clawed at the\nstone beside her, pulling up to her feet. \"Let us go--let us go quickly!\nThey will try again--move farther in--\"\n\n\"Listen,\" Travis had to be sure of one thing--\"have they any way of\nknowing that they had you under control and that you have again\nescaped?\"\n\nKaydessa shook her head, some of the panic again shadowing her eyes.\n\n\"Then we'll just go on--\" his chin lifted to the wastelands before\nthem--\"try to keep out of their reach.\"\n\nAnd away from the pass to the south, he told himself silently. He dared\nnot lead the enemy to that secret, so he must travel west or hole up\nsomewhere in this unknown wilderness until they could be sure Kaydessa\nwas no longer susceptible to that call, or that they were safely beyond\nits beamed radius. There was the chance of contacting her outlaw kin,\njust as there was the chance of stumbling into a pack of the ape-things.\nBefore dark they must discover a protected camp site.\n\nThey needed water, food. He had a bare half dozen ration tablets. But\nthe coyotes could locate water.\n\n\"Come!\" Travis beckoned to Kaydessa, motioning her to climb ahead of him\nso that he could watch for any indication of her succumbing once again\nto the influence of the enemy. But his burdened early morning flight had\ntold on Travis more than he thought, and he discovered he could not spur\nhimself on to a pace better than a walk. Now and again one of the\ncoyotes, usually Nalik'ideyu, would come into view, express impatience\nin both stance and mental signal, and then be gone again. The Apache was\nincreasingly aware that the animals were disturbed, yet to his tentative\ngropings at contact they did not reply. Since they gave no warning of\nhostile animal or man, he could only be on constant guard, watching the\ncountryside about him.\n\nThey had been following a ledge for several minutes before Travis was\naware of some strange features of that path. Perhaps he had actually\nnoted them with a trained eye before his archaeological studies of the\nrecent past gave him a reason for the faint marks. This crack in the\nmountain's skin might have begun as a natural fault, but afterward it\nhad been worked with tools, smoothed, widened to serve the purpose of\nsome form of intelligence!\n\nTravis caught at Kaydessa's shoulder to slow her pace. He could not have\ntold why he did not want to speak aloud here, but he felt the need for\nsilence. She glanced around, perplexed, more so when he went down on his\nknees and ran his fingers along one of those ancient tool marks. He was\ncertain it was very old. Inside of him anticipation bubbled. A road made\nwith such labor could only lead to something of importance. He was going\nto make the discovery, the dream which had first drawn him into these\nmountains.\n\n\"What is it?\" Kaydessa knelt beside him, frowning at the ledge.\n\n\"This was cut by someone, a long time ago,\" Travis half whispered and\nthen wondered why. There was no reason to believe the road makers could\nhear him when perhaps a thousand years or more lay between the chipping\nof that stone and this day.\n\nThe Tatar girl looked over her shoulder. Perhaps she too was troubled by\nthe sense that here time was subtly telescoped, that past and present\nmight be meeting. Or was that feeling with them both because of their\nenforced conditioning?\n\n\"Who?\" Now her voice sank in turn.\n\n\"Listen--\" he regarded her intently--\"did your people or the Reds ever\nfind any traces of the old civilization here--ruins?\"\n\n\"No.\" She leaned forward, tracing with her own finger the same\nalmost-obliterated marks which had intrigued Travis. \"But I think they\nhave looked. Before they discovered that we could be free, they sent out\nparties--to hunt, they said--but afterward they always asked many\nquestions about the country. Only they never asked about ruins. Is that\nwhat they wished us to find? But why? Of what value are old stones piled\non one another?\"\n\n\"In themselves, little, save for the knowledge they may give us of the\npeople who piled them. But for what the stones might contain--much\nvalue!\"\n\n\"And how do you know what they might contain, Fox?\"\n\n\"Because I have seen such treasure houses of the star men,\" he returned\nabsently. To him the marks on the ledge were a pledge of greater\ndiscoveries to come. He must find where that carefully constructed road\nran--to what it led. \"Let us see where this will take us.\"\n\nBut first he gave the chittering signal in four sharp bursts. And the\ntawny-gray bodies came out of the tangled brush, bounding up to the\nledge. Together the coyotes faced him, their attention all for his\nhalting communication.\n\nRuins might lie ahead; he hoped that they did. But on another planet\nsuch ruins had twice proved to be deadly traps, and only good fortune\nhad prevented their closing on Terran explorers. If the ape-things or\nany other dangerous form of life had taken up residence before them, he\nwanted good warning.\n\nTogether the coyotes turned and loped along the now level way of the\nledge, disappearing around a curve fitted to the mountain side while\nTravis and Kaydessa followed.\n\nThey heard it before they saw its source--a waterfall. Probably not a\nlarge one, but high. Rounding the curve, they came into a fine mist of\nspray where sunlight made rainbows of color across a filmy veil of\nwater.\n\nFor a long moment they stood entranced. Kaydessa then gave a little cry,\nheld out her hands to the purling mist and brought them to her lips\nagain to suck the gathered moisture.\n\nWater slicked the surface of the ledge, and Travis pushed her back\nagainst the wall of the cliff. As far as he could discern, their road\ncontinued behind the out-flung curtain of water, and footing on the wet\nstone was treacherous. With their backs to the solid security of the\nwall, facing outward into the solid drape of water, they edged behind it\nand came out into rainbowed sunlight again.\n\nHere either provident nature or ancient art had hollowed a pocket in the\nstone which was filled with water. They drank. Then Travis filled his\ncanteen while Kaydessa washed her face, holding the cold freshness of\nthe moisture to her cheeks with both palms.\n\nShe spoke, but he could not hear her through the roar. She leaned closer\nand raised her voice to a half shout:\n\n\"This is a place of spirits! Do you not also feel their power, Fox?\"\n\nPerhaps for a space out of time he did feel something. This was a\nwatering place, perhaps a never-ceasing watering place--and to his\ndesert-born-and-bred race all water was a spirit gift never to be taken\nfor granted. The rainbow--the Spirit People's sacred sign--old beliefs\nstirred in Travis, moving him. \"I feel,\" he said, nodding in emphasis to\nhis agreement.\n\nThey followed the ledge road to a section where a landslide of an\nearlier season had choked it. Travis worked a careful way across the\ndebris, Kaydessa obeying his guidance in turn. Then they were on a\nsloping downward way which led to a staircase--the treads weather-worn\nand crumbling, the angle so steep Travis wondered if it had ever been\nintended for beings with a physique approximating the Terrans'.\n\nThey came to a cleft where an arch of stone was chiseled out as a\nroofing. Travis thought he could make out a trace of carving on the\ncapstone, so worn by years and weather that it was now only a faint\nshadow of design.\n\nThe cleft was a door into another valley. Here, too, golden mist swirled\nin tendrils to disguise and cloak what stood there. Travis had found his\nruins. Only the structures were intact, not breached by time.\n\nMist flowed in lapping tongues back and forth, confusing outlines, now\nshuttering, now baring oval windows which were spaced in diamonds of\nfour on round tower surfaces. There were no visible cracks, no cloaking\nof climbing vegetation, nothing to suggest age and long roots in the\nvalley. Nor did the architecture he could view match any he had seen on\nthose other worlds.\n\nTravis strode away from the cleft doorway. Under his moccasins was a\nblock pavement, yellow and green stone set in a simple pattern of\nchecks. This, too, was level, unchipped and undisturbed, save for a\ndrift or two of soil driven in by the wind. And nowhere could he see any\nvegetation.\n\nThe towers were of the same green stone as half the pavement blocks, a\nglassy green which made him think of jade--if jade could be mined in\nsuch quantities as these five-story towers demanded.\n\nNalik'ideyu padded to him, and he could hear the faint click of her\nclaws on the pavement. There was a deep silence in this place, as if the\nair itself swallowed and digested all sound. The wind which had been\nwith them all the day of their journeying was left beyond the cleft.\n\nYet there was life here. The coyote told him that in her own way. She\nhad not made up her mind concerning that life--wariness and curiosity\nwarred in her now as her pointed muzzle lifted toward the windows\noverhead.\n\nThe windows were all well above ground level, but there was no opening\nin the first stories as far as Travis could see. He debated moving into\nthe range of those windows to investigate the far side of the towers for\ndoorways. The mist and the message from Nalik'ideyu nourished his\nsuspicions. Out in the open he would be too good a target for whatever\nor whoever might be standing within the deep-welled frames.\n\nThe silence was shattered by a boom. Travis jumped, slewed half around,\nknife in hand.\n\nBoom-boom ... a second heavy beat-beat ... then a clangor with a\nswelling echo.\n\nKaydessa flung back her head and called, her voice rising up as if\ntunneled by the valley walls. She then whistled as she had done when\nthey fronted the ape-thing and ran on to catch at Travis' sleeve, her\nface eager.\n\n\"My people! Come--it is my people!\"\n\nShe tugged him on before breaking into a run, weaving fearlessly around\nthe base of one of the towers. Travis ran after her, afraid he might\nlose her in the mist.\n\nThree towers, another stretch of open pavement, and then the mist lifted\nto show them a second carved doorway not two hundred yards ahead. The\nboom-boom seemed to pull Kaydessa, and Travis could do nothing but trail\nher, the coyotes now trotting beside him.\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nThey burst through a last wide band of mist into a wilderness of tall\ngrass and shrubs. Travis heard the coyotes give tongue, but it was too\nlate. Out of nowhere whirled a leather loop, settling about his chest,\nsnapping his arms tight to his body, taking him off his feet with a jerk\nto be dragged helplessly along the ground behind a galloping horse.\n\nA tawny fury sprang in the air to snap at the horse's head. Travis\nkicked fruitlessly, trying to regain his feet as the horse reared, and\nfought against the control of his shouting rider. All through the melee\nthe Apache heard Kaydessa shrilly screaming words he did not understand.\n\nTravis was on his knees, coughing in the dust, exerting the muscles in\nhis chest and shoulders to loosen the lariat. On either side of him the\ncoyotes wove a snarling pattern of defiance, dashing back and forth to\npresent no target for the enemy, yet keeping the excited horses so\nstirred up that their riders could use neither ropes nor blades.\n\nThen Kaydessa ran between two of the ringing horses to Travis and jerked\nat the loop about him. The tough, braided leather eased its hold, and he\nwas able to gasp in full lungfuls of air. She was still shouting, but\nthe tone had changed from one of recognition to a definite scolding.\n\nTravis won to his feet just as the rider who had lassoed him finally got\nhis horse under rein and dismounted. Holding the rope, the man walked\nhand over hand toward them, as Travis back on the Arizona range would\nhave approached a nervous, unschooled pony.\n\nThe Mongol was an inch or so shorter than the Apache, and his face was\nyoung, though he had a drooping mustache bracketing his mouth with\nslender spear points of black hair. His breeches were tucked into high\nred boots, and he wore a loose felt jacket patterned with the same\nelaborate embroidery Travis had seen on Kaydessa's. On his head was a\nhat with a wide fur border--in spite of the heat--and that too bore\ntouches of scarlet and gold design.\n\nStill holding his lariat, the Mongol reached Kaydessa and stood for a\nmoment, eying her up and down before he asked a question. She gave an\nimpatient twitch to the rope. The coyotes snarled, but the Apache\nthought the animals no longer considered the danger immediate.\n\n\"This is my brother Hulagur.\" Kaydessa made the introduction over her\nshoulder. \"He does not have your speech.\"\n\nHulagur not only did not understand, he was also impatient. He jerked at\nthe rope with such sudden force that Travis was almost thrown. Then\nKaydessa dragged as fiercely on the lariat in the other direction and\nburst into a soaring harangue which drew the rest of the men closer.\n\nTravis flexed his upper arms, and the slack gained by Kaydessa's action\nmade the lariat give again. He studied the Tatar outlaws. There were\nfive of them beside Hulagur, lean men, hard-faced, narrow-eyed, the\nragged clothing of three pieced out with scraps of hide. Besides the\nswords with the curved blades, they were armed with bows, two to each\nman, one long, one shorter. One of the riders carried a lance, long\ntassels of woolly hair streaming from below its head. Travis saw in them\na formidable array of barbaric fighting men, but he thought that man for\nman the Apaches could not only take on the Mongols with confidence, but\nmight well defeat them.\n\nThe Apache had never been a hot-headed, ride-for-glory fighter like the\nCheyenne, the Sioux, and the Comanche of the open plains. He estimated\nthe odds against him, used ambush, trick, and every feature of the\ncountryside as weapon and defense. Fifteen Apache fighting men under\nChief Geronimo had kept five thousand American and Mexican troops in the\nfield for a year and had come off victorious for the moment.\n\nTravis knew the tales of Genghis Khan and his formidable generals who\nswept over Asia into Europe, unbeaten and seemingly undefeatable. But\nthey had been a wild wave, fed by a reservoir of manpower from the\nsteppes of their homeland, utilizing driven walls of captives to protect\ntheir own men in city assaults and attacks. He doubted if even that\nendless sea of men could have won the Arizona desert defended by Apaches\nunder Cochise, Victorio, or Magnus Colorado. The white man had done\nit--by superior arms and attrition; but bow against bow, knife against\nsword, craft and cunning against craft and cunning--he did not think\nso....\n\nHulagur dropped the end of the lariat, and Kaydessa swung around,\nloosening the loop so that the rope fell to Travis' feet. The Apache\nstepped free of it, turned and passed between two of the horsemen to\ngather up the bow he had dropped. The coyotes had gone with him and when\nhe turned again to face the company of Tatars, both animals crowded past\nhim to the entrance of the valley, plainly urging him to retire there.\n\nThe horsemen had faced about also, and the warrior with the lance\nbalanced the shaft of the weapon in his hand as if considering the\npossibility of trying to spear Travis. But just then Kaydessa came up,\ntowing Hulagur by a firm hold on his sash-belt.\n\n\"I have told this one,\" she reported to Travis, \"how it is between us\nand that you also are enemy to those who hunt us. It is well that you\nsit together beside a fire and talk of these things.\"\n\nAgain that boom-boom broke her speech, coming from farther out in the\nopen land.\n\n\"You will do this?\" She made of it a half question, half statement.\n\nTravis glanced about him. He could dodge back into the misty valley of\nthe towers before the Tatars could ride him down. However, if he could\npatch up some kind of truce between his people and the outlaws, the\nApaches would have only the Reds from the settlement to watch. Too many\ntimes in Terran past had war on two fronts been disastrous.\n\n\"I come--carrying this--and not pulled by your ropes.\" He held up his\nbow in an exaggerated gesture so that Hulagur could understand.\n\nCoiling the lariat, the Mongol looked from the Apache bow to Travis.\nSlowly, and with obvious reluctance, he nodded agreement.\n\nAt Hulagur's call the lancer rode up to the waiting Apache, stretched\nout a booted foot in the heavy stirrup, and held down a hand to bring\nTravis up behind him riding double. Kaydessa mounted in the same fashion\nbehind her brother.\n\nTravis looked at the coyotes. Together the animals stood in the door to\nthe tower valley, and neither made any move to follow as the horses\ntrotted off. He beckoned with his hand and called to them.\n\nHeads up, they continued to watch him go in company with the Mongols.\nThen without any reply to his coaxing, they melted back into the mists.\nFor a moment Travis was tempted to slide down and run the risk of taking\na lance point between the shoulders as he followed Naginlta and\nNalik'ideyu into retreat. He was startled, jarred by the new awareness\nof how much he had come to depend on the animals. Ordinarily, Travis Fox\nwas not one to be governed by the wishes of a _mba'a_, intelligent and\nun-animallike as it might be. This was an affair of men, and coyotes had\nno part in it!\n\nHalf an hour later Travis sat in the outlaw camp. There were fifteen\nMongols in sight, a half dozen women and two children adding to the\ncount. On a hillock near their yurts, the round brush-and-hide\nshelters--not too different from the wickiups of Travis' own people--was\na crude drum, a hide stretched taut over a hollowed section of log. And\nnext to that stood a man wearing a tall pointed cap, a red robe, and a\ngirdle from which swung a fringe of small bones, tiny animal skulls, and\npolished bits of stone and carved wood.\n\nIt was this man's efforts which sent the boom-boom sounding at intervals\nover the landscape. Was this a signal--part of a ritual? Travis was not\ncertain, though he guessed that the drummer was either medicine man or\nshaman, and so of some power in this company. Such men were credited\nwith the ability to prophesy and also endowed with mediumship between\nman and spirit in the old days of the great Hordes.\n\nThe Apache evaluated the rest of the company. As was true of his own\nparty, these men were much the same age--young and vigorous. And it was\nalso apparent that Hulagur held a position of some importance among\nthem--if he were not their chief.\n\nAfter a last resounding roll on the drum, the shaman thrust the sticks\ninto his girdle and came down to the fire at the center of the camp. He\nwas taller than his fellows, pole thin under his robes, his face narrow,\nclean-shaven, with brows arched by nature to give him an unchanging\nexpression of scepticism. He strode along, his tinkling collection of\ncharms providing him with a not unmusical accompaniment, and came to\nstand directly before Travis, eying him carefully.\n\nTravis copied his silence in what was close to a duel of wills. There\nwas that in the shaman's narrowed green eyes which suggested that if\nHulagur did in fact lead these fighting men, he had an advisor of\ndetermination and intelligence behind him.\n\n\"This is Menlik.\" Kaydessa did not push past the men to the fireside,\nbut her voice carried.\n\nHulagur growled at his sister, but his admonition made no impression on\nher, and she replied in as hot a tone. The shaman's hand went up,\nsilencing both of them.\n\n\"You are--who?\" Like Kaydessa, Menlik spoke a heavily accented English.\n\n\"I am Travis Fox, of the Apaches.\"\n\n\"The Apaches,\" the shaman repeated. \"You are of the West, the American\nWest, then.\"\n\n\"You know much, man of spirit talk.\"\n\n\"One remembers. At times one remembers,\" Menlik answered almost\nabsently. \"How does an Apache find his way across the stars?\"\n\n\"The same way Menlik and his people did,\" Travis returned. \"You were\nsent to settle this planet, and so were we.\"\n\n\"There are many more of you?\" countered Menlik swiftly.\n\n\"Are there not many of the Horde? Would one man, or three, or four, be\nsent to hold a world?\" Travis fenced. \"You hold the north, we the south\nof this land.\"\n\n\"But _they_ are not governed by a machine!\" Kaydessa cut in. \"They are\nfree!\"\n\nMenlik frowned at the girl. \"Woman, this is a matter for warriors. Keep\nyour tongue silent between your jaws!\"\n\nShe stamped one foot, standing with her fists on her hips.\n\n\"I am a Daughter of the Blue Wolf. And we are all warriors--men and\nwomen alike--so shall we be as long as the Horde is not free to ride\nwhere we wish! These men have won their freedom; it is well that we\nlearn how.\"\n\nMenlik's expression did not change, but his lids drooped over his eyes\nas a murmur of what might be agreement came from the group. More than\none of them must have understood enough English to translate for the\nothers. Travis wondered about that. Had these men and women who had\noutwardly reverted to the life of their nomad ancestors once been well\neducated in the modern sense, educated enough to learn the basic\nlanguage of the nation their rulers had set up as their principal enemy?\n\n\"So you ride the land south of the mountains?\" the shaman continued.\n\n\"That is true.\"\n\n\"Then why did you come hither?\"\n\nTravis shrugged. \"Why does anyone ride or travel into new lands? There\nis a desire to see what may lie beyond----\"\n\n\"Or to scout before the march of warriors!\" Menlik snapped. \"There is no\npeace between your rulers and mine. Do you ride now to take the herds\nand pastures of the Horde--or to try to do so?\"\n\nTravis turned his head deliberately from side to side, allowing them all\nto witness his slow and openly contemptuous appraisal of their camp.\n\n\"_This_ is your Horde, Shaman? Fifteen warriors? Much has changed since\nthe days of Temujin, has it not?\"\n\n\"What do you know of Temujin--you, who are a man of no ancestors, out of\nthe West?\"\n\n\"What do I know of Temujin? That he was a leader of warriors and became\nGenghis Khan, the great lord of the East. But the Apaches had their\nwarlords also, rider of barren lands. And I am of those who raided over\ntwo nations when Victorio and Cochise scattered their enemies as a man\nscatters a handful of dust in the wind.\"\n\n\"You talk bold, Apache....\" There was a hint of threat in that.\n\n\"I speak as any warrior, Shaman. Or are you so used to talking with\nspirits instead of men that you do not realize that?\"\n\nHe might have been alienating the shaman by such a sharp reply, but\nTravis thought he judged the temper of these people. To face them boldly\nwas the only way to impress them. They would not treat with an inferior,\nand he was already at a disadvantage coming on foot, without any backing\nin force, into a territory held by horsemen who were suspicious and\njealous of their recently acquired freedom. His only chance was to\nestablish himself as an equal and then try to convince them that Apache\nand Tatar-Mongol had a common cause against the Reds who controlled the\nsettlement on the northern plains.\n\nMenlik's right hand went to his sash-girdle and plucked out a carved\nstick which he waved between them, muttering phrases Travis could not\nunderstand. Had the shaman retreated so far along the road to his past\nthat he now believed in his own supernatural powers? Or was this to\nimpress his watching followers?\n\n\"You call upon your spirits for aid, Menlik? But the Apache has the\ncompanionship of the _ga-n_. Ask of Kaydessa: Who hunts with the Fox in\nthe wilds?\" Travis' sharp challenge stopped that wand in mid-air.\nMenlik's head swung to the girl.\n\n\"He hunts with wolves who think like men.\" She supplied the information\nthe shaman would not openly ask for. \"I have seen them act as his\nscouts. This is no spirit thing, but real and of this world!\"\n\n\"Any man may train a dog to his bidding!\" Menlik spat.\n\n\"Does a dog obey orders which are not said aloud? These brown wolves\ncome and sit before him, look into his eyes. And then he knows what lies\nwithin their heads, and they know what he would have them do. This is\nnot the way of a master of hounds with his pack!\"\n\nAgain the murmur ran about the camp as one or two translated. Menlik\nfrowned. Then he rammed his sorcerer's wand back into his sash.\n\n\"If you are a man of power--such powers,\" he said slowly, \"then you may\nwalk alone where those who talk with spirits go--into the mountains.\" He\nthen spoke over his shoulder in his native tongue, and one of the women\nreached behind her into a hut, brought out a skin bag and a horn cup.\nKaydessa took the cup from her and held it while the other woman poured\na white liquid from the bag to fill it.\n\nKaydessa passed the cup to Menlik. He pivoted with it in his hand,\ndribbling expertly over its brim a few drops at each point of the\ncompass, chanting as he moved. Then he sucked in a mouthful of the\ncontents before presenting the vessel to Travis.\n\nThe Apache smelled the same sour scent that had clung to the emptied bag\nin the foothills. And another part of memory supplied him with the\nnature of the drink. This was kumiss, a fermented mare's milk which was\nthe wine and water of the steppes.\n\nHe forced himself to swallow a draft, though it was alien to his taste,\nand passed the cup back to Menlik. The shaman emptied the horn and,\nwith that, set aside ceremony. With an upraised hand he beckoned Travis\nto the fire again, indicating a pot set on the coals.\n\n\"Rest ... eat!\" he bade abruptly.\n\nNight was gathering in. Travis tried to calculate how far Tsoay must\nhave backtracked to the rancheria. He thought that he could have already\nmade the pass and be within a day and a half from the Apache camp if he\npushed on, as he would. As to where the coyotes were, Travis had no\nidea. But it was plain that he himself must remain in this encampment\nfor the night or risk rousing the Mongols' suspicion once more.\n\nHe ate of the stew, spearing chunks out of the pot with the point of his\nknife. And it was not until he sat back, his hunger appeased, that the\nshaman dropped down beside him.\n\n\"The Khatun Kaydessa says that when she was slave to the caller, you did\nnot feel its chains,\" he began.\n\n\"Those who rule you are not my overlords. The bonds they set upon your\nminds do not touch me.\" Travis hoped that that was the truth and his\nescape that morning had not been just a fluke.\n\n\"This could be, for you and I are not of one blood,\" Menlik agreed.\n\"Tell me--how did you escape your bonds?\"\n\n\"The machine which held us so was broken,\" Travis replied with a portion\nof the truth, and Menlik sucked in his breath.\n\n\"The machines, always the machines!\" he cried hoarsely. \"A thing which\ncan sit in a man's head and make him do what it will against his will;\nit is demon sent! There are other machines to be broken, Apache.\"\n\n\"Words will not break them,\" Travis pointed out.\n\n\"Only a fool rides to his death without hope of striking a single blow\nbefore he chokes on the blood in his throat,\" Menlik retorted. \"We\ncannot use bow or tulwar against weapons which flame and kill quicker\nthan any storm lightning! And always the mind machines can make a man\ndrop his knife and stand helplessly waiting for the slave collar to be\nset on his neck!\"\n\nTravis asked a question of his own. \"I know that they can bring a caller\npart way into this mountain, for this very day I saw its effect upon the\nmaiden. But there are many places in the hills well set for ambushes,\nand those unaffected by the machine could be waiting there. Would there\nbe many machines so that they could send out again and again?\"\n\nMenlik's bony hand played with his wand. Then a slow smile curved his\nlips into the guise of a hunting cat's noiseless snarl.\n\n\"There is meat in that pot, Apache, rich meat, good for the filling of a\nlean belly! So men whose minds the machine could not trouble--such men\nto be waiting in ambush for the taking of the men who use such a\nmachine--yes. But here would have to be bait, very good bait for such a\ntrap, Lord of Wiles. Never do those others come far into the mountains.\nTheir flyer does not lift well here, and they do not trust traveling on\nhorseback. They were greatly angered to come so far in to reach\nKaydessa, though they could not have been too close, or you would not\nhave escaped at all. Yes, strong bait.\"\n\n\"Such bait as perhaps the knowledge that there were strangers across the\nmountains?\"\n\nMenlik turned his wand about in his hands. He was no longer smiling, and\nhis glance at Travis was sharp and swift.\n\n\"Do you sit as Khan in your tribe, Lord?\"\n\n\"I sit as one they will listen to.\" Travis hoped that was so. Whether\nBuck and the moderates would hold clan leadership upon his return was a\nfact he could not count upon as certain.\n\n\"This is a thing which we must hold council over,\" Menlik continued.\n\"But it is an idea of power. Yes, one to think about, Lord. And I shall\nthink....\"\n\nHe got up and moved away. Travis blinked at the fire. He was very tired,\nand he disliked sleeping in this camp. But he must not go without the\nrest his body needed to supply him with a clear head in the morning. And\nnot showing uneasiness might be one way of winning Menlik's confidence.\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nTravis settled his back against the spire of rock and raised his right\nhand into the path of the sun, cradling in his palm a disk of glistening\nmetal. Flash ... flash ... he made the signal pattern just as his\nancestors a hundred years earlier and far across space had used trade\nmirrors to relay war alerts among the Chiricahua and White Mountain\nranges. If Tsoay had returned safely, and if Buck had kept the agreed\nlookout on that peak a mile or so ahead, then the clan would know that\nhe was coming and with what escort.\n\nHe waited now, rubbing the small metal mirror absently on the loose\nsleeve of his shirt, waiting for a reply. Mirrors were best, not smoke\nfires which would broadcast too far the presence of men in the hills.\nTsoay must have returned....\n\n\"What is it that you do?\"\n\nMenlik, his shaman's robe pulled up so that his breeches and boots were\ndark against the golden rock, climbed up beside the Apache. Menlik,\nHulagur, and Kaydessa were riding with Travis, offering him one of\ntheir small ponies to hurry the trip. He was still regarded warily by\nthe Tatars, but he did not blame them for their cautious attitude.\n\n\"Ah--\" A flicker of light from the point ahead. One ... two ... three\nflashes, a pause, then two more together. He had been read. Buck had\ndispatched scouts to meet them, and knowing his people's skill at the\nbusiness, Travis was certain the Tatars would never suspect their\nflanking unless the Apaches purposefully revealed themselves. Also the\nTatars were not to go to the rancheria, but would be met at a mid-point\nby a delegation of Apaches. This was no time for the Tatars to learn\njust how few the clan numbered.\n\nMenlik watched Travis flash an acknowledgment to the sentry ahead. \"In\nthis way you speak to your men?\"\n\n\"This way I speak.\"\n\n\"A thing good and to be remembered. We have the drum, but that is for\nthe ears of all with hearing. This is for the eyes only of those on\nwatch for it. Yes, a good thing. And your people--they will meet with\nus?\"\n\n\"They wait ahead,\" Travis confirmed.\n\nIt was close to midday and the heat, gathered in the rocky ways, was\nlike a heaviness in the air itself. The Tatars had shucked their heavy\njackets and rolled the fur brims of their hats far up their heads away\nfrom their sweat-beaded faces. And at every halt they passed from hand\nto hand the skin bag of kumiss.\n\nNow even the ponies shuffled on with drooping heads, picking a way in a\ncut which deepened into a canyon. Travis kept a watch for the scouts.\nAnd not for the first time he thought of the disappearance of the\ncoyotes. Somehow, back in the Tatar camp, he had counted confidently on\nthe animals' rejoining him once he had started his return over the\nmountains.\n\nBut he had seen nothing of either beast, nor had he felt that\nunexplainable mental contact with them which had been present since his\nfirst awakening on Topaz. Why they had left him so unceremoniously after\ndefending him from the Mongol attack, and why they were keeping\nthemselves aloof now, he did not know. But he was conscious of a thread\nof alarm for their continued absence, and he hoped he would find they\nhad gone back to the rancheria.\n\nThe ponies thudded dispiritedly along a sandy wash which bottomed the\ncanyon. Here the heat became a leaden weight and the men were panting\nlike four-footed beasts running before hunters. Finally Travis sighted\nwhat he had been seeking, a flicker of movement on the wall well above.\nHe flung up his hand, pulling his mount to a stand. Apaches stood in\nfull view, bows ready, arrows on cords. But they made no sound.\n\nKaydessa cried out, booted her mount to draw equal with Travis.\n\n\"A trap!\" Her face, flushed with heat, was also stark with anger.\n\nTravis smiled slowly. \"Is there a rope about you, Wolf Daughter?\" he\ninquired softly. \"Are you now dragged across this sand?\"\n\nHer mouth opened and then closed again. The quirt she had half raised to\nslash at him, flopped across her pony's neck.\n\nThe Apache glanced back at the two men. Hulagur's hand was on his sword\nhilt, his eyes darting from one of those silent watchers to the next.\nBut the utter hopelessness of the Tatar position was too plain. Only\nMenlik made no move toward any weapon, even his spirit wand. Instead, he\nsat quietly in the saddle, displaying no emotion toward the Apaches save\nhis usual self-confident detachment.\n\n\"We go on.\" Travis pointed ahead.\n\nJust as suddenly as they had appeared from the heart of the golden\ncliffs, so did the scouts vanish. Most of them were already on their way\nto the point Buck had selected for the meeting place. There had been\nonly six men up there, but the Tatars had no way of knowing just how\nlarge a portion of the whole clan that number was.\n\nTravis' pony lifted his head, nickered, and achieved a stumbling trot.\nSomewhere ahead was water, one of those oases of growth and life which\npocked the whole mountain range--to the preservation of all animals and\nall men.\n\nMenlik and Hulagur pushed on until their mounts were hard on the heels\nof the two ridden by the girl and Travis. Travis wondered if they still\nwaited for some arrow to strike home, though he saw that both men rode\nwith outward disregard for the patrolling scouts.\n\nA grass-leaf bush beckoned them on and again the ponies quickened pace,\ncoming out into a tributary canyon which housed a small pool and a good\nstand of grass and brush. To one side of the water Buck stood, his arms\nfolded across his chest, armed only with his belt knife. Grouped behind\nhim were Deklay, Tsoay, Nolan, Manulito--Travis tabulated hurriedly.\nManulito and Deklay were to be classed together--or had been when he was\nlast in the rancheria. On Buck's stairway from the past, both had\nhalted more than halfway down. Nolan was a quiet man who seldom spoke,\nand whose opinion Travis could not foretell. Tsoay would back Buck.\n\nProbably such a divided party was the best Travis could have hoped to\ngather. A delegation composed entirely of those who were ready to leave\nthe past of the Redax--a collection of Bucks and Jil-Lees--was outside\nthe bounds of possibility. But Travis was none too happy to have Deklay\nin on this.\n\nTravis dismounted, letting the pony push forward by himself to dip nose\ninto the pool.\n\n\"This is,\" Travis pointed politely with his chin--\"Menlik, one who talks\nwith spirits.... Hulagur, who is son to a chief ... and Kaydessa, who is\ndaughter to a chief. They are of the horse people of the north.\" He made\nthe introduction carefully in English.\n\nThen he turned to the Tatars. \"Buck, Deklay, Nolan, Manulito, Tsoay,\" he\nnamed them all, \"these stand to listen, and to speak for the Apaches.\"\n\nBut sometime later when the two parties sat facing each other, he\nwondered whether a common decision could come from the clansmen on his\nside of that irregular circle. Deklay's expression was closed; he had\neven edged a short way back, as if he had no desire to approach the\nstrangers. And Travis read into every line of Deklay's body his distrust\nand antagonism.\n\nHe himself began to speak, retelling his adventures since they had\nfollowed Kaydessa's trail, sketching in the situation at the\nTatar-Mongol settlement as he had learned it from her and from Menlik.\nHe was careful to speak in English so that the Tatars could hear all he\nwas reporting to his own kind. And the Apaches listened blank-faced,\nthough Tsoay must already have reported much of this. When Travis was\ndone it was Deklay who asked a question:\n\n\"What have we to do with these people?\"\n\n\"There is this--\" Travis chose his words carefully, thinking of what\nmight move a warrior still conditioned to riding with the raiders of a\nhundred years earlier, \"the Pinda-lick-o-yi (whom we call 'Reds,') are\nnever willing to live side by side with any who are not of their mind.\nAnd they have weapons such as make our bow cords bits of rotten string,\nour knives slivers of rust. They do not kill; they enslave. And when\nthey discover that we live, then they will come against us--\"\n\nDeklay's lips moved in a wolf grin. \"This is a large land, and we know\nhow to use it. The Pinda-lick-o-yi will not find us--\"\n\n\"With their eyes maybe not,\" Travis replied. \"With their machines--that\nis another matter.\"\n\n\"Machines!\" Deklay spat. \"Always these machines.... Is that all you can\ntalk about? It would seem that you are bewitched by these machines,\nwhich we have not seen--none of us!\"\n\n\"It was a machine which brought you here,\" Buck observed. \"Go you back\nand look upon the spaceship and remember, Deklay. The knowledge of the\nPinda-lick-o-yi is greater than ours when it deals with metal and wire\nand things which can be made with both. Machines brought us along the\nroad of the stars, and there is no tracker in the clan who could hope to\ndo the same. But now I have this to ask: Does our brother have a plan?\"\n\n\"Those who are Reds,\" Travis answered slowly, \"they do not number many.\nBut more may later come from our own world. Have you heard of such\narriving?\" he asked Menlik.\n\n\"Not so, but we are not told much. We live apart and no one of us goes\nto the ship unless he is summoned. For they have weapons to guard them,\nor long since they would have been dead. It is not proper for a man to\neat from the pot, ride in the wind, sleep easy under the same sky with\nhim who has slain his brother.\"\n\n\"They have then killed among your people?\"\n\n\"They have killed,\" Menlik returned briefly.\n\nKaydessa stirred and muttered a word or two to her brother. Hulagur's\nhead came up, and he exploded into violent speech.\n\n\"What does he say?\" Deklay demanded.\n\nThe girl replied: \"He speaks of our father who aided in the escape of\nthree and so afterward was slain by the leader as a lesson to us--since\nhe was our 'white beard,' the Khan.\"\n\n\"We have taken the oath in blood--under the Wolf Head Standard--that\nthey will also die,\" Menlik added. \"But first we must shake them out of\ntheir ship-shell.\"\n\n\"That is the problem,\" Travis elaborated for the benefit of his\nclansmen. \"We must get these Reds away from their protected camp--out\ninto the open. When they now go they are covered by this 'caller' which\nkeeps the Tatars under their control, but it has no effect on us.\"\n\n\"So, again I say: What is all this to us?\" Deklay got to his feet. \"This\nmachine does not hunt us, and we can make our camps in this land where\nno Pinda-lick-o-yi can find them----\"\n\n\"We are not _dobe-gusndhe-he_--invulnerable. Nor do we know the full\nrange of machines they can use. It does no one well to say\n'_doxa-da_'--this is not so--when he does not know all that lies in an\nenemy's wickiup.\"\n\nTo Travis' relief he saw agreement mirrored on Buck's face, Tsoay's,\nNolan's. From the beginning he had had little hope of swaying Deklay; he\ncould only trust that the verdict of the majority would be the accepted\none. It went back to the old, old Apache institution of prestige. A\n_nantan_-chief had the _go'ndi_, the high power, as a gift from birth.\nCommon men could possess horse power or cattle power; they might have\nthe gift of acquiring wealth so they could make generous gifts--be\n_ikadntl'izi_, the wealthy ones who spoke for their family groups within\nthe loose network of the tribe. But there was no hereditary\nchieftainship or even an undivided rule within a rancheria. The\n_nagunlka-dnat'an_, or war chief, often led only on the warpath and had\nno voice in clan matters save those dealing with a raid.\n\nAnd to have a split now would fatally weaken their small clan. Deklay\nand those of a like mind might elect to withdraw and not one of the rest\ncould deny him that right.\n\n\"We shall think on this,\" Buck said. \"Here is food, water, pasturage for\nhorses, a camp for our visitors. They will wait here.\" He looked at\nTravis. \"You will wait with them, Fox, since you know their ways.\"\n\nTravis' immediate reaction was objection, but then he realized Buck's\nwisdom. To offer the proposition of alliance to the Apaches needed an\nimpartial spokesman. And if he himself did it, Deklay might\nautomatically oppose the idea. Let Buck talk and it would be a statement\nof fact.\n\n\"It is well,\" Travis agreed.\n\nBuck looked about, as if judging time from the lie of sun and shadow on\nthe ground. \"We shall return in the morning when the shadow lies here.\"\nWith the toe of his high moccasin he made an impression in the soft\nearth. Then, without any formal farewell, he strode off, the others fast\non his heels.\n\n\"He is your chief, that one?\" Kaydessa asked, pointing after Buck.\n\n\"He is one having a large voice in council,\" Travis replied. He set\nabout building up the cooking fire, bringing out the body of a\nsplit-horn calf which had been left them. Menlik sat on his heels by the\npool, dipping up drinking water with his hand. Now he squinted his eyes\nagainst the probe of the sun.\n\n\"It will require much talking to win over the short one,\" he observed.\n\"That one does not like us or your plan. Just as there will be those\namong the Horde who will not like it either.\" He flipped water drops\nfrom his fingers. \"But this I do know, man who calls himself Fox, if we\ndo not make a common cause, then we have no hope of going against the\nReds. It will be for them as a man crushing fleas.\" He brought his hand\ndown on his knee in emphatic slaps. \"So ... and so ... and so!\"\n\n\"This do I think also,\" Travis admitted.\n\n\"So let us both hope that all men will be as wise as we,\" Menlik said,\nsmiling. \"And since we can take a hand in that decision, this remains a\ntime for rest.\"\n\nThe shaman might be content to sleep the afternoon away, but after he\nhad eaten, Hulagur wandered up and down the valley, making a lengthy\nbusiness of rubbing down their horses with twists of last season's\ngrass. Now and then he paused beside Kaydessa and spoke, his uneasiness\nplain to Travis although he could not understand the words.\n\nTravis had settled down in the shade, half dozing, yet alert to every\nmovement of the three Tatars. He tried not to think of what might be\nhappening in the rancheria by switching his mind to that misty valley of\nthe towers. Did any of those three alien structures contain such a grab\nbag of the past as he, Ashe, and Murdock had found on that other world\nwhere the winged people had gathered together for them the artifacts of\nan older civilization? At that time he had created for their hosts a new\nweapon of defense, turning metal tubes into blow-guns. It had been\nthere, too, where he had chanced upon the library of tapes, one of which\nhad eventually landed Travis and his people here on Topaz.\n\nEven if he did find racks of such tapes in one of those towers, there\nwould be no way of using them--with the ship wrecked on the mountain\nside. Only--Travis' fingers itched where they lay quiet on his\nknees--there might be other things waiting. If he were only free to\nexplore!\n\nHe reached out to touch Menlik's shoulder. The shaman half turned,\nopening his eyes with the languid effort of a sleepy cat. But the spark\nof intelligence awoke in them quickly.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\nFor a moment Travis hesitated, already regretting his impulse. He did\nnot know how much Menlik remembered of the present. Remember of the\npresent--one part of the Apache's mind was wryly amused at that snarled\nestimate of their situation. Men who had been dropped into their racial\nand ancestral pasts until the present time was less real than the\ndreams conditioning them had a difficult job evaluating any situation.\nBut since Menlik had clung to his knowledge of English, he must be less\nfar down that stairway.\n\n\"When we met you, Kaydessa and I, it was outside that valley.\" Travis\nwas still of two minds about this questioning, but the Tatar camp had\nbeen close to the towers and there was a good chance the Mongols had\nexplored them. \"And inside were buildings ... very old....\"\n\nMenlik was fully alert now. He took his wand, played with it as he\nspoke:\n\n\"That is, or was, a place of much power, Fox. Oh, I know that you\nquestion my kinship with the spirits and the powers they give. But one\nlearns not to dispute what one feels here--and here--\" His long,\nsomewhat grimy fingers went to his forehead and then to the bare brown\nchest where his shirt fell open. \"I have walked the stone path in that\nvalley, and there have been the whispers--\"\n\n\"Whispers?\"\n\nMenlik twirled the wand. \"Whispers which are too low for many ears to\ndistinguish. You can hear them as one hears the buzzing of an insect,\nbut never the words--no, never the words! But that is a place of great\npower!\"\n\n\"A place to explore!\"\n\nBut Menlik watched only his wand. \"That I wonder, Fox, truly do I\nwonder. This is not our world. And here there may be that which does not\nwelcome us.\"\n\nTricks-in-trade of a shaman? Or was it true recognition of something\nbeyond human description? Travis could not be sure, but he knew that he\nmust return to the valley and see for himself.\n\n\"Listen,\" Menlik said, leaning closer, \"I have heard your tale, that\nyou were on that first ship, the one which brought you unwilling along\nthe old star paths. Have you ever seen such a thing as this?\"\n\nHe smoothed a space of soft earth and with the narrow tip of his wand\nbegan to draw. Whatever role Menlik had played in the present before he\nhad been reconditioned into a shaman of the Horde, he had had the\nability of an artist, for with a minimum of lines he created a figure in\nthat sketch.\n\nIt was a man or at least a figure with general human outlines. But the\nround, slightly oversized skull was bare, the clothing skintight to\nreveal unnaturally thin limbs. There were large eyes, small nose and\nmouth, rather crowded into the lower third of the head, giving an\nimpression of an over-expanded brain case above. And it was familiar.\n\nNot the flying men of the other world, certainly not the nocturnal\nape-things. Yet for all its alien quality Travis was sure he had seen\nits like before. He closed his eyes and tried to visualize it apart from\nlines in the soil.\n\nSuch a head, white, almost like the bone of a skull laid bare, such a\nhead lying face down on a bone-thin arm clad in a blue-purple skintight\nsleeve. Where had he seen it?\n\nThe Apache gave a sharp exclamation as he remembered fully. The derelict\nspaceship as he had first found it--the dead alien officer had still\nbeen seated at its controls! The alien who had set the tape which took\nthem out into that forgotten empire--he was the subject of Menlik's\ndrawing!\n\n\"Where? When did you see such a one?\" The Apache bent down over the\nTatar.\n\nMenlik looked troubled. \"He came into my mind when I walked the valley.\nI thought I could almost see such a face in one of the tower windows,\nbut of that I am not sure. Who is it?\"\n\n\"Someone from the old days--those who once ruled the stars,\" Travis\nanswered. But were they still here then, the remnant of a civilization\nwhich had flourished ten thousand years ago? Were the Baldies, who\ncenturies ago had hunted down so ruthlessly the Russians who had dared\nto loot their wrecked ships, still on Topaz?\n\nHe remembered the story of Ross Murdock's escape from those aliens in\nthe far past of Europe, and he shivered. Murdock was tough, steel tough,\nyet his own description of that epic chase and the final meeting had\ncarried with it his terror. What could a handful of primitively armed\nand almost primitively minded Terrans do now if they had to dispute\nTopaz with the Baldies?\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\"Beyond this--\" Menlik worked his way to the very lip of a drop, raising\na finger cautiously--\"beyond this we do not go.\"\n\n\"But you say that the camp of your people lies well out in the plains--\"\nJil-Lee was up on one knee, using the field glasses they had brought\nfrom the stores of the wrecked ship. He passed them along to Travis.\nThere was nothing to be sighted but the rippling amber waves of the tall\ngrasses, save for an occasional break of a copse of trees near the\nfoothills.\n\nThey had reached this point in the early morning, threading through the\npass, making their way across the section known to the outlaws. From\nhere they could survey the debatable land where their temporary allies\ninsisted the Reds were in full control.\n\nThe result of the conference in the south had been this uneasy alliance.\nFrom the start Travis realized that he could not hope to commit the clan\nto any set plan, that even to get this scouting party to come against\nthe stubborn resistance of Deklay and his reactionaries was a major\nachievement. There was now an opening wedge of six Apaches in the\nnorth.\n\n\"Beyond this,\" Menlik repeated, \"they keep watch and can control us with\nthe caller.\"\n\n\"What do you think?\" Travis passed the glasses to Nolan.\n\nIf they were ever to develop a war chief, this lean man, tall for an\nApache and slow to speak, might fill that role. He adjusted the lenses\nand began a detailed study-sweep of the open territory. Then he\nstiffened; his mouth, below the masking of the glasses, was tight.\n\n\"What is it?\" Jil-Lee asked.\n\n\"Riders--two ... four ... five.... Also something else--in the air.\"\n\nMenlik jerked back and grabbed at Nolan's arm, dragging him down by the\nweight of his body.\n\n\"The flyer! Come back--back!\" He was still pulling at Nolan, prodding at\nTravis with one foot, and the Apaches stared at him with amazement.\n\nThe shaman sputtered in his own language, and then, visibly regaining\ncommand of himself, spoke English once more.\n\n\"Those are hunters, and they carry a caller. Either some others have\nescaped or they are determined to find our mountain camp.\"\n\nJil-Lee looked at Travis. \"You did not feel anything when the woman was\nunder that spell?\"\n\nTravis shook his head. Jil-Lee nodded and then said to the shaman: \"We\nshall stay here and watch. But since it is bad for you--do you go. And\nwe shall meet you near this place of the towers. Agreed?\"\n\nFor a moment Menlik's face held a shadowy expression Travis tried to\nread. Was it resentment--resentment that he was forced to retreat when\nthe others could stand their ground? Did the Tatar believe that he lost\nface this way? But the shaman gave a grunt of what they took as assent\nand slipped over the edge of the lookout point. A moment later they\nheard him speaking the Mongol tongue, warning Hulagur and Lotchu, his\ncompanions on the scout. Then came the clatter of pony hoofs as they\nrode their mounts away.\n\nThe Apaches settled back in the cup, which gave them a wide view over\nthe plains. Soon it was not necessary to use the glasses in order to\nsight the advancing party of hunters--five riders, four wearing Tatar\ndress. The fifth had such an odd outline that Travis was reminded of\nMenlik's sketch of the alien. Under the sharper vision of the glasses he\nsaw that the rider was equipped with a pack strapped between his\nshoulders and a bulbous helmet covering most of his head. Highly\nspecialized equipment for communication, Travis guessed.\n\n\"That is a 'copter up above,\" Nolan said. \"Different shape from ours.\"\n\nThey had been familiar with helicopters back on Terra. Ranchers used\nthem for range inspection, and all of the Apache volunteers had flown in\nthem. But Nolan was correct; this one possessed several unfamiliar\nfeatures.\n\n\"The Tatars say they don't bring those very far into the mountains,\"\nJil-Lee mused. \"That could explain their man on horseback; he gets in\nwhere they don't fly.\"\n\nNolan fingered his bow. \"If these Reds depend upon their machine to\ncontrol what they seek, then they may be taken by surprise----\"\n\n\"But not yet!\" Travis spoke sharply. Nolan frowned at him.\n\nJil-Lee chuckled. \"The way is not so dark for us, younger brother, that\nwe need your torch held for our feet!\"\n\nTravis swallowed back any retort, accepting the fairness of that rebuke.\nHe had no right to believe that he alone knew the best way of handling\nthe enemy. Biting on the sourness of that realization, he lay quietly\nwith the others, watching the riders enter the foothills perhaps a\nquarter of a mile to the west.\n\nThe helicopter was circling now over the men riding into a cut between\ntwo rises. When they were lost to view, the pilot made wider casts, and\nTravis thought the flyer's crew were probably in communication with the\nhelmeted one of the quintet on the ground.\n\nHe stirred. \"They are heading for the Tatar camp, just as if they know\nexactly where it is--\"\n\n\"That also may be true,\" Nolan replied. \"What do we know of these\nTatars? They have freely said that the Reds can hold them in mind ropes\nwhen they wish. Already they may be so bound. I say--let us go back to\nour own country.\" He added to the decisiveness of that by handing\nJil-Lee the glasses and sliding down from their perch.\n\nTravis looked at the other. In a way he could understand the wisdom of\nNolan's suggestion. But he was sure that withdrawal now would only\npostpone trouble. Sooner or later the Apaches would have to stand\nagainst the Reds, and if they could do it now while the enemy was\noccupied with trouble from the Tatars, so much the better.\n\nJil-Lee was following Nolan. But something in Travis rebelled. He\nwatched the circling helicopter. If it was overhanging the action area\nof the horsemen, they had either reined in or were searching a\nrelatively small section of the foothills.\n\nReluctantly Travis descended to the hollow where Jil-Lee stood with\nNolan. Tsoay and Lupe and Rope were a little to one side as if the final\norders would come from their seniors.\n\n\"It would be well,\" Jil-Lee said slowly, \"if we saw what weapons they\nhave. I want a closer look at the equipment of that one in the helmet.\nAlso,\" he smiled straight at Nolan--\"I do not think that they can detect\nthe presence of warriors of the People unless we will it so.\"\n\nNolan ran a finger along the curve of his bow, shot a measuring glance\nright and left at the general contours of the country.\n\n\"There is wisdom in what you say, elder brother. Only this is a trail we\nshall take alone, not allowing the men with fur hats to know where we\nwalk.\" He looked pointedly in Travis' direction.\n\n\"That is wisdom, _Ba'is'a_,\" Travis promptly replied, giving Nolan the\nold title accorded the leader of a war party. Travis was grateful for\nthat much of a concession.\n\nThey swung into action, heading southeast at an angle which should bring\nthem across the track of the enemy hunting party. The path was theirs at\nlast, only moments after the passing of their quarry. None of the five\nriders was taking any precautions to cover his trail. Each moved with\nthe confidence of one not having to fear any attack.\n\nFrom cover the Apaches looked aloft. They could hear the faint hum of\nthe helicopter. It was still circling, Tsoay reported from a higher\ncheck point, but those circles remained close over the plains area--the\nriders had already passed beyond the limits of that aerial sentry.\n\nThree to a side, the Apaches advanced with the trail between them. They\nwere carefully hidden when they caught up with the hunters. The four\nTatars were grouped together; the fifth man, heavily burdened by his\npack, had climbed from the saddle and was sitting on the ground, his\nhands busy with a flat plate which covered him from upper chest to belt.\n\nNow that he had a chance to see them closely, Travis noted the lack of\nexpression on the broad Tatar faces. The four men were blank of eye,\nastride their mounts with no apparent awareness of their present\nsurroundings. Then as one, their heads swung around to the helmeted\nleader before they dismounted and stood motionless for a long moment in\na way which reminded Travis of the coyotes' attitude when they\nendeavored to pass some message to him. But these men even lacked the\nsigns of thinking intelligence the animals had.\n\nThe helmeted man's hand moved across his chest plate, and instantly his\nfollowers came into a measure of life. One put his hand to his forehead\nwith an odd, half-dazed gesture. Another half crouched, his lips\nwrinkling back in a snarl. And the leader, watching him, laughed. Then\nhe snapped an order, his hand poised over his control plate.\n\nOne of the four took the horse reins, made the mounts fast to near-by\nbushes. Then as one they began to walk forward, the Red bringing up the\nrear several paces behind the nearest Tatar. They were going upslope to\nthe crest of a small ridge.\n\nThe Tatar who first reached the crest put his hands to cup his mouth,\nsent a ringing cry southward, and the faint \"hu-hu-hu\" echoed on and on\nthrough the hills.\n\nEither Menlik had reached the camp in time, or his people were not to be\nso easily enticed. For though the hunters waited for a long time, there\nwas no answer to that hail. At last the helmeted man called his\ncaptives, bringing them sullenly down to mount and ride again--a move\nwhich suited the Apaches.\n\nThey could not tell how close was the communication between the rider\nand the helicopter. And they were still too near the plains to attack\nunless it was necessary for their own protection. Travis dropped back to\njoin Nolan.\n\n\"He controls them by that plate on his chest,\" he said. \"If we would\ntake them, we must get at that--\"\n\n\"These Tatars use lariats in fighting. Did they not rope you as a calf\nis roped for branding? Then why do they not so take this Red, binding\nhis arms to his sides?\" The suspicion in Nolan's voice was plain.\n\n\"Perhaps in them is some conditioned control making it so that they\ncannot attack their rulers--\"\n\n\"I do not like this matter of machines which can play this way and that\nwith minds and bodies!\" flared Nolan. \"A man should only _use_ a weapon,\nnot be one!\"\n\nTravis could agree to that. Had they by the wreck of their own ship and\nthe death of Ruthven, escaped just such an existence as these Tatars now\nendured? If so, why? He and all the Apaches were volunteers, eager and\nwilling to form new world colonies. What had happened back on Terra that\nthey had been so ruthlessly sent out without warning and under Redax?\nAnother small piece of that puzzle, or maybe the heart of the whole\npicture snapped into place. Had the project learned in some way of the\nTatar settlement on Topaz and so been forced to speed up that\ntranslation from late twentieth-century Americans to primitives? That\nwould explain a lot!\n\nTravis returned abruptly to the matter now at hand as he saw a peak\nahead. The party they were trailing was heading directly for the outlaw\nhide-out. Travis hoped Menlik had warned them in time. There--that wall\nof cliff to his left must shelter the valley of the towers, though it\nwas still miles ahead. Travis did not believe the hunters would be able\nto reach their goal unless they traveled at night. They might not know\nof the ape-things which could menace the dark.\n\nBut the enemy, whether he knew of such dangers or not, did not intend to\npress on. As the sun pulled away, leaving crevices and crannies shadow\ndark, the hunters stopped to make camp. The Apaches, after their custom\non the war trail, gathered on the heights above.\n\n\"This Red seems to think that he shall find those he seeks sitting\nwaiting for him, as if their feet were nipped tight in a trap,\" Tsoay\nremarked.\n\n\"It is the habit of the Pinda-lick-o-yi,\" Lupe added, \"to believe they\nare greater than all others. Yet this one is a stupid fool walking into\nthe arms of a she-bear with a cub.\" He chuckled.\n\n\"A man with a rifle does not fear a man armed only with a stick,\" Travis\ncut in quickly. \"This one is armed with a weapon which he has good\nreason to believe makes him invulnerable to attack. If he rests tonight,\nhe probably leaves his machine on guard.\"\n\n\"At least we are sure of one thing,\" Nolan said in half agreement. \"This\none does not suspect that there are any in these hills save those he can\nmaster. And his machine does not work against us. Thus at dawn--\" He\nmade a swift gesture, and they smiled in concert.\n\nAt dawn--the old time of attack. An Apache does not attack at night.\nTravis was not sure that any of them could break that old taboo and\ncreep down upon the camp before the coming of new light.\n\nBut tomorrow morning they would take over this confident Red, strip him\nof his enslaving machine.\n\nTravis' head jerked. It had come as suddenly as a blow between his\neyes--to half stun him. What ... what was it? Not any physical\nimpact--no, something which was dazing but still immaterial. He braced\nhis whole body, awaiting its return, trying frantically to understand\nwhat had happened in that instant of vertigo and seeming disembodiment.\nNever had he experienced anything like it--or had he? Two years or more\nago when he had gone through the time transfer to enter the Arizona of\nthe Folsom Men some ten thousand years earlier--that moment of transfer\nhad been something like this, a sensation of being awry in space and\ntime with no stable footing to be found.\n\nYet he was lying here on very tangible rock and soil, and nothing about\nhim in the shadow-hung landscape of Topaz had changed in the slightest.\nBut that blow had left behind it a quivering residue of panic buried far\ninside him, a tender spot like an open wound.\n\nTravis drew a deep breath which was almost a sob, levered himself up on\none elbow to stare intently down into the enemy camp. Was this some\nattack from the other's unknown weapon? Suddenly he was not at all sure\nwhat might happen when the Apaches made that dawn rush.\n\nJil-Lee was in station on his right. Travis must compare notes with him\nto be sure that this was not indeed a trap. Better to retreat now than\nto be taken like fish in a net. He crept out of his place, gave the\nchittering signal call of the fluff-ball, and heard Jil-Lee's answer in\na cleverly mimicked trill of a night insect.\n\n\"Did you feel something just now--in your head?\" Travis found it\ndifficult to put that sensation into words.\n\n\"Not so. But you did?\"\n\nHe had--of course, he had! The remains of it were still in him, that\npoint of panic. \"Yes.\"\n\n\"The machine?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\" Travis' confusion grew. It might be that he alone of the\nparty had been struck. If so, he could be a danger to his own kind.\n\n\"This is not good. I think we had better hold council, away from here.\"\nJil-Lee's whisper was the merest ghost of sound. He chirped again to be\nanswered from Tsoay upslope, who passed on the signal.\n\nThe first moon was high in the sky as the Apaches gathered together.\nAgain Travis asked his question: Had any of the others felt that odd\nblow? He was met by negatives.\n\nBut Nolan had the final word: \"This is not good,\" he echoed Jil-Lee's\ncomment. \"If it was the Red machine at work, then we may all be swept\ninto his net along with those he seeks. Perhaps the longer one remains\nclose to that thing, the more influence it gains over him. We shall stay\nhere until dawn. If the enemy would reach the place they seek, then they\nmust pass below us, for that is the easiest road. Burdened with his\nmachine, that Red has ever taken the easiest way. So, we shall see if he\nalso has a defense against these when they come without warning.\" He\ntouched the arrows in his quiver.\n\nTo kill from ambush meant that they might never learn the secret of the\nmachine, but after his experience Travis was willing to admit that\nNolan's caution was the wise way. Travis wanted no part of a second\nattack like that which had shaken him so. And Nolan had not ordered a\ngeneral retreat. It must be in the war chief's thoughts as it was in\nTravis' that if the machine could have an influence over Apaches, it\nmust cease to function.\n\nThey set their ambush with the age-old skill the Redax had grafted into\ntheir memories. Then there was nothing to do but wait.\n\nIt was an hour after dawn when Tsoay signaled that the enemy was coming,\nand shortly after, they heard the thud of ponies' hoofs. The first Tatar\nplodded into view, and by the stance of his body in the saddle, Travis\nknew the Red had him under full control. Two, then three Tatars passed\nbetween the teeth of the Apache trap. The fourth one had allowed a wider\ngap to open between himself and his fellows.\n\nThen the Red leader came. His face below the bulge of the helmet was not\nhappy. Travis believed the man was not a horseman by inclination. The\nApache set arrow to bow cord, and at the chirp from Nolan, fired in\nconcert with his clansmen.\n\nOnly one of those arrows found a target. The Red's pony gave a shrill\nscream of pain and terror, reared, pawing at the air, toppled back,\npinning its shouting rider under it.\n\nThe Red had had a defense right enough, one which had somehow deflected\nthe arrows. But he neither had protection against his own awkward seat\nin the saddle nor the arrow which had seriously wounded the now\nthreshing pony.\n\nAhead the Tatars twisted and writhed, mouthed tortured cries, then\ndropped out of their saddles to lie limply on the ground as if the\narrows aimed at the master had instead struck each to the heart.\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\nEither the Red was lucky, or his reactions were quick. He had somehow\nrolled clear of the struggling horse as Lupe leaped from behind a\nboulder, knife out and ready. To the eyes of the Apaches the helmeted\nman lay easy prey to Lupe's attack. Nor did he raise an arm to defend\nhimself, though one hand lay free across the plate on his chest.\n\nBut the young Apache stumbled, rebounding back as if he had run into an\nunseen wall--when his knife was still six inches away from the other.\nLupe cried out, shook under a second impact as the Red fired an\nautomatic with his other hand.\n\nTravis dropped his bow, returned to the most primitive weapon of all.\nHis hand closed around a stone and he hurled the fist-sized oval\nstraight at the helmet so clearly outlined against the rocks below.\n\nBut even as Lupe's knife had never touched flesh, so was the rock\ndeflected; the Red was covered by some protective field. This was\ncertainly nothing the Apaches had seen before. Nolan's whistle summoned\nthem to draw back.\n\nThe Red fired again, the sharp bark of the hand gun harsh and loud. He\ndid not have any real target, for with the exception of Lupe the Apaches\nhad gone to earth. Between the rocks the Red was struggling to his feet,\nbut he moved slowly, favoring his side and one leg; he had not come\ntotally unharmed from his tumble with the pony.\n\nAn armed enemy who could not be touched--one who knew there were more\nthan outlaws in this region. The Red leader was far more of a threat to\nthe Apaches now than he had ever been. He must not be allowed to escape.\n\nHe was holstering his gun, moving along with one hand against the rocks\nto steady himself, trying to reach one of the ponies that stood with\ntrailing reins beside the inert Tatars.\n\nBut when the enemy reached the far side of that rock he would have to\nsacrifice either his steadying hold, or his touch on the chest plate\nwhere his other hand rested. Would he, then, for an instant be\nvulnerable?\n\nThe pony!\n\nTravis put an arrow on bow cord and shot. Not at the Red, who had\nreleased his hold of the rock, preferring to totter instead of lose\ncontrol of the chest plate--but into the air straight before the nose of\nthe mount.\n\nThe pony neighed wildly, tried to turn, and its shoulder caught the\nfree, groping hand of the Red and spun the man around and back, so that\nhe flung up both hands in an effort to ward himself off the rocks. Then\nthe pony stampeded down the break, its companions catching the same\nfever, trailing in a mad dash which kept the Red hard against the\nboulders.\n\nHe continued to stand there until the horses, save for the wounded one\nstill kicking fruitlessly, were gone. Travis felt a sense of reprieve.\nThey might not be able to get at the Red, but he was hurt and afoot, two\nstrikes which might yet reduce him to a condition the Apaches could\nhandle.\n\nApparently the other was also aware of that, for now he pushed out from\nthe rocks and stumbled along after the ponies. But he went only a step\nor two. Then, settling back once more against a convenient boulder, he\nbegan to work at the plate on his chest.\n\nNolan appeared noiselessly beside Travis. \"What does he do?\" His lips\nwere very close to the younger man's ear, his voice hardly more than a\nbreath.\n\nTravis shook his head slightly. The Red's actions were a complete\nmystery. Unless, now disabled and afoot, he was trying to summon aid.\nThough there was no landing place for a helicopter here.\n\nNow was the time to try and reach Lupe. Travis had seen a slight\nmovement in the fallen Apache's hand, the first indication that the\nenemy's shot had not been as fatal as it had looked. He touched Nolan's\narm, pointed to Lupe; and then, discarding his bow and quiver beside the\nwar leader, he stripped for action. There was cover down to the wounded\nApache which would aid him. He must pass one of the Tatars on the way,\nbut none of the tribesmen had shown any signs of life since they had\nfallen from their saddles at the first attack.\n\nWith infinite care, Travis lowered himself into a narrow passage, took a\nlizard's way between brush and boulder, pausing only when he reached the\nTatar for a quick check on the potential enemy.\n\nThe lean brown face was half turned, one cheek in the sand, but the\nslack mouth, the closed eyes were those, Travis believed, of a dead man.\nBy some action of his diabolic machine the Red must have snuffed out his\nfour captives--perhaps in the belief that they were part of the Apache\nattack.\n\nTravis reached the rock where Lupe lay. He knew that Nolan was watching\nthe Red and would give him warning if he suddenly showed an interest in\nanything but his machine. The Apache reached out, his hands closing on\nLupe's ankles. Beneath his touch, flesh and muscle tensed. Lupe's eyes\nwere open, focused now on Travis. There was a bleeding furrow above his\nright ear. The Red had tried a difficult head shot, failing in his aim\nby a mere fraction of an inch.\n\nLupe made a swift move for which Travis was ready. His grip on the\nother's body helped to tumble them both around a rock which lay between\nthem and the Red. There was the crack of another shot and dust spurted\nfrom the side of the boulder. But they lay together, safe for the\npresent, as Travis was sure the enemy would not risk an open attack on\ntheir small fortress.\n\nWith Travis' aid Lupe struggled back up to the site where Nolan waited.\nJil-Lee was there to make competent examination of the boy's wound.\n\n\"Creased,\" he reported. \"A sore head, but no great damage. Perhaps a\nscar later, warrior!\" He gave Lupe an encouraging thump on the shoulder,\nbefore plastering an aid pack over the cut.\n\n\"Now we go!\" Nolan spoke with emphatic decision.\n\n\"He saw enough of us to know we are not Tatars.\"\n\nNolan's eyes were cold, his mouth grim as he faced Travis.\n\n\"And how can we fight him--?\"\n\n\"There is a wall--a wall you cannot see--about him,\" Lupe broke in.\n\"When I would strike at him, I could not!\"\n\n\"A man with invisible protection and a gun,\" Jil-Lee took up the\nargument. \"How would you deal with him, younger brother?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Travis admitted. Yet he also believed that if they\nwithdrew, left the Red here to be found by his own people, the enemy\nwould immediately begin an investigation of the southern country.\nPerhaps, pushed by their need for learning more about the Apaches, they\nwould bring the helicopter in over the mountains. The answer to all\nApache dangers, for now, lay in the immediate future of this one man.\n\n\"He is hurt, he cannot go far on foot. And even if he calls the 'copter,\nthere is no landing place. He will have to move elsewhere to be picked\nup.\" Travis thought aloud, citing the thin handful of points in their\nfavor.\n\nTsoay nodded toward the rim of the ravine. \"Rocks up there and rocks can\nroll. Start an earthslide....\"\n\nSomething within Travis balked at that. From the first he had been\nwilling enough to slug it out with the Red, weapon to weapon, man to\nman. Also, he had wanted to take a captive, not stand over a body. But\nto use the nature of the country against the enemy, that was the oldest\nApache trick of all and one they would have to be forced to employ.\n\nNolan had already nodded in assent, and Tsoay and Jil-Lee started off.\nEven if the Red did possess a protective wall device, could it operate\nin full against a landslide? They all doubted that.\n\nThe Apaches reached the cliff rim without exposing themselves to the\nenemy's fire. The Red still sat there calmly, his back against the rock,\nhis hands busy with his equipment as if he had all the time in the\nworld.\n\nThen suddenly came a scream from more than one throat.\n\n\"_Dar-u-gar_!\" The ancient war cry of the Mongol Hordes.\n\nThen over the lip of the other slope rose a wave of men--their curved\nswords out, a glazed set to their eyes--heading for the Amerindians with\nutter disregard for any personal safety. Menlik in the lead, his\nshaman's robe flapping wide below his belt like the wings of some\noversized predatory bird. Hulagur ... Jagatai ... men from the outlaws'\ncamp. And they were not striving to destroy their disabled overlord in\nthe vale below, but to wipe out the Apaches!\n\nOnly the fact that the Apaches were already sheltered behind the rocks\nthey were laboring to dislodge gave them a precious few moments of\ngrace. There was no time to use their bows. They could only use knives\nto meet the swords of the Tatars, knives and the fact that they could\nfight with unclouded minds.\n\n\"He has them under control!\" Travis pawed at Jil-Lee's shoulder. \"Get\nhim--they'll stop!\"\n\nHe did not wait to see if the other Apache understood. Instead, he threw\nthe full force of his own body against the rock they had made the center\nstone of their slide. It gave, rolled, carrying with it and before it\nthe rest of the piled rubble. Travis stumbled, fell flat, and then a\nbody thudded down upon him, and he was fighting for his life to keep a\nblade from his throat. Around him were the shouts and cries of embroiled\nwarriors; then all was silenced by a roar from below.\n\nGlazed eyes in a face only a foot from his own, the twisted, panting\nmouth sending gusts of breath into his nostrils. Suddenly there was\nreason back in those eyes, a bewilderment, which became fear ...\npanic.... The Tatar's body twisted in Travis' hold, striving now not to\nattack, but to win free. As the Apache loosened his grip the other\njerked away, so that for a moment or two they lay gasping, side by side.\n\nMen sat up to look at men. There was a spreading stain down Jil-Lee's\nside and one of the Tatars sprawled near him, both his hands on his\nchest, coughing violently.\n\nMenlik clawed at the trunk of a wind-twisted mountain tree, pulled\nhimself to his feet, and stood swaying as might a man long ill and\nrecovering from severe exertion.\n\nInsensibly both sides drew apart, leaving a space between Tatar and\nApache. The faces of the Amerindians were grim, those of the Mongols\nbewildered and then harsh as they eyed their late opponents with dawning\nreason. What had begun in compulsion for the Tatars might well flare now\ninto rational combat--and from that to a campaign of extermination.\n\nTravis was on his feet. He looked over the lip of the drop. The Red was\nstill in his place down there, a pile of rubble about him. His\nprotection must have failed, for his head was back at an unnatural angle\nand the dent in his helmet could be easily seen.\n\n\"That one is dead--or helpless!\" Travis cried out. \"Do you still wish to\nfight for him, Shaman?\"\n\nMenlik came away from the tree and walked to the edge of the drop. The\nothers, too, were moving forward. After the shaman looked down he\nstooped, picked up a small stone, and flung it at the motionless Red.\nThere was a crack of sound. They all saw the tiny spurt of flame, a curl\nof smoke from the plate on the Red's chest. Not only the man, but his\ncontrol was finished now.\n\nA wolfish growl and two of the Tatars swung over, started down to the\nRed. Menlik shouted and they slackened pace.\n\n\"We want that,\" he cried in English. \"Perhaps so we can learn--\"\n\n\"The learning is yours,\" Jil-Lee replied. \"Just as this land is yours,\nShaman. But I warn you, from this day do not ride south!\"\n\nMenlik turned, the charms on his belt clicking. \"So that is the way it\nis to be, Apache?\"\n\n\"That is the way it shall be, Tatar! We do not ride to war with allies\nwho may turn their knives against our backs because they are slaves to a\nmachine the enemy controls.\"\n\nThe Tatar's long, slender-fingered hands opened and closed. \"You are a\nwise man, Apache, but sometimes more than wisdom alone is needed----\"\n\n\"We are wise men, Shaman, let it rest there,\" Jil-Lee replied somberly.\n\nAlready the Apaches were on their way, putting two cliff ridges behind\nthem before they halted to examine and cover their wounds.\n\n\"We go.\" Nolan's chin lifted, indicating the southern route. \"Here we\ndo not come again; there is too much witchcraft in this place.\"\n\nTravis stirred, saw that Jil-Lee was frowning at him.\n\n\"Go--?\" he repeated.\n\n\"Yes, younger brother? You would continue to run with these who are\ngoverned by a machine?\"\n\n\"No. Only, eyes are needed on this side of the mountains.\"\n\n\"Why?\" This time Jil-Lee was plainly on the side of the conservatives.\n\"We have now seen this machine at work. It is fortunate that the Red is\ndead. He will carry no tales of us back to his people as you feared.\nThus, if we remain south from now on, we are safe. And this fight\nbetween Tatar and Red is none of ours. What do you seek here?\"\n\n\"I must go again to the place of the towers,\" Travis answered with the\ntruth. But his friends were facing him with heavy disapproval--now a\nfull row of Deklays.\n\n\"Did you not tell us that you felt this strange thing during the night\nwe waited about the camp? What if you become one with these Tatars and\nare also controlled by the machine? Then you, too, can be made into a\nweapon against us--your clansmen!\" Jil-Lee was almost openly hostile.\n\nSense was on his side. But in Travis was this other desire of which he\nwas becoming more conscious by the minute. There was a reason for those\ntowers, perhaps a reason important enough for him to discover and run\nthe risk of angering his own people.\n\n\"There may be this--\" Nolan's voice was remote and cold, \"you may\nalready be a piece of this thing, bound to the machines. If so, we do\nnot want you among us.\"\n\nThere it was--an open hostility with more power behind it than Deklay's\nmotiveless disapproval had carried. Travis was troubled. The family, the\nclan--they were important. If he took the wrong step now and was\noutlawed from that tight fortress, then as an Apache he would indeed be\na lost man. In the past of his people there had been renegades from the\ntribe--men such as the infamous Apache Kid who had killed and killed\nagain, not only white men but his own people. Wolf men living wolves'\nlives in the hills. Travis was threatened with that. Yet--up the ladder\nof civilization, down the ladder--why did this feverish curiosity ride\nhim so cruelly now?\n\n\"Listen,\" Jil-Lee, his side padded with bandages, stepped closer--\"and\ntell me, younger brother, what is it that you seek in these towers?\"\n\n\"On another world there were secrets of the old ones to be found in such\nancient buildings. Here that might also be true.\"\n\n\"And among the secrets of those old ones,\" Nolan's voice was still\nharsh--\"were those which brought us to this world, is that not so?\"\n\n\"Did any man drive you, Nolan, or you, Tsoay, or you, Jil-Lee, or any of\nus, to promise to go beyond the stars? You were told what might be done,\nand you were eager to try it. You were all volunteers!\"\n\n\"Save for this voyage when we were told nothing,\" Jil-Lee answered,\ncutting straight to the heart of the matter. \"Yet, Nolan, I do not\nbelieve that it is for more voyage tapes that our younger brother now\nsearches, nor would those do us any good--as our ship will not rise\nagain from here. What is it that you do seek?\"\n\n\"Knowledge--weapons, maybe. Can we stand against these machines of the\nReds? Yet many of the devices they now use are taken from the star ships\nthey have looted through time. To every weapon there is a defense.\"\n\nNolan blinked and for the first time a hint of interest touched the mask\nof his face. \"To the bow, the rifle,\" he said softly, \"to the rifle, the\nmachine gun, to the cannon, the big bomb. The defense can be far worse\nthan the first weapon. So you think that in these towers there may be\nthings which shall be to the Reds' machines as the bomb is to the cannon\nof the Horse Soldiers?\"\n\nTravis had an inspiration. \"Did not our people lay aside the bow for the\nrifle when we went up against the Bluecoats?\"\n\n\"We do not so go up against these Reds!\" protested Lupe.\n\n\"Not now. But what if they come across the mountains, perhaps driving\nthe Tatars before them to do their fighting--?\"\n\n\"And you believe that if you find weapons in these towers, you will know\nhow to use them?\" Jil-Lee asked. \"What will give you that knowledge,\nyounger brother?\"\n\n\"I do not claim such knowledge,\" Travis countered. \"But this much I do\nhave: Once I studied to be an archaeologist and I have seen other\nstorehouses of these star people. Who else among us can say as much as\nthat?\"\n\n\"That is the truth,\" Jil-Lee acknowledged. \"Also there is good sense in\nthis seeking out of the tower things. Let the Reds find such first--if\nthey exist at all--and then we may truly be caught in a box canyon with\nonly death at our heels.\"\n\n\"And you would go to these towers now?\" Nolan demanded.\n\n\"I can cut across country and then rejoin you on the other side of the\npass!\" The feeling of urgency which had been mounting in Travis was now\nso demanding that he wanted to race ahead through the wilderness. He was\nsurprised when Jil-Lee put out his palm up as if to warn the younger\nman.\n\n\"Take care, younger brother! This is not a lucky business. And remember,\nif one goes too far down a wrong trail, there is sometimes no\nreturning--\"\n\n\"We shall wait on the other side of the pass for one day,\" Nolan added.\n\"Then--\" he shrugged--\"where you go will be your own affair.\"\n\nTravis did not understand that promise of trouble. He was already two\nsteps down his chosen path.\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\nTravis had taken a direct cross route through the heights, but not\nswiftly enough to reach his objective before nightfall. And he had no\nwish to enter the tower valley by moonlight. In him two emotions now\nwarred. There was the urge to invade the towers, to discover their\nsecret, and flaring higher and higher the beginnings of a new fear. Was\nhe now a battlefield for the superstitions of his race reborn by the\nRedax and his modern education in the Pinda-lick-o-yi world--half Apache\nbrave of the past, half modern archaeologist with a thirst for\nknowledge? Or was the fear rooted more deeply and for another reason?\n\nTravis crouched in a hollow, trying to understand what he felt. Why was\nit suddenly so overwhelmingly important for him to investigate the\ntowers? If he only had the coyotes with him.... Why and where had they\ngone?\n\nHe was alive to every noise out of the night, every scent the wind\ncarried to him. The night had its own life, just as the daylight hours\nheld theirs. Only a few of those sounds could he identify, even less did\nhe see. There was one wide-winged, huge flying thing which passed\nacross the green-gold plate of the nearer moon. It was so large that for\nan instant Travis believed the helicopter had come. Then the wings\nflapped, breaking the glide, and the creature merged in the shadows of\nthe night--a hunter large enough to be a serious threat, and one he had\nnever seen before.\n\nRelying on his own small defense, the strewing of brittle sticks along\nthe only approach to the hollow, Travis dozed at intervals, his head\ndown on his forearm across his bent knees. But the cold cramped him and\nhe was glad to see the graying sky of pre-dawn. He swallowed two ration\ntablets and a couple of mouthfuls of water from his canteen and started\non.\n\nBy sunup he had reached the ledge of the waterfall, and he hurried along\nthe ancient road at a pace which increased to a run the closer he drew\nto the valley. Deliberately he slowed, his native caution now in\ncontrol, so that he was walking as he passed through the gateway into\nthe swirling mists which alternately exposed and veiled the towers.\n\nThere was no change in the scene from the time he had come there with\nKaydessa. But now, rising from a comfortable sprawl on the\nyellow-and-green pavement, was a welcoming committee--Nalik'ideyu and\nNaginlta showing no more excitement at his coming than if they had\nparted only moments before.\n\nTravis went down on one knee, holding out his hand to the female, who\nhad always been the more friendly. She advanced a step or two, touched a\ncold nose to his knuckles, and whined.\n\n\"Why?\" He voiced that one word, but behind it was a long list of\nquestions. Why had they left him? Why were they here where there was no\nhunting? Why did they meet him now as if they had calmly expected his\nreturn?\n\nTravis glanced from the animals to the towers, those windows set in\ndiamond pattern. And again he was visited by the impression that he was\nunder observation. With the mist floating across those openings, it\nwould be easy for a lurker to watch him unseen.\n\nHe walked slowly on into the valley, his moccasins making no sound on\nthe pavement, but he could hear the faint click of the coyotes' claws as\nthey paced beside him, on each hand. The sun did not penetrate here,\nmaking merely a gilt fog of the mist. As he approached within touching\ndistance of the first tower, it seemed to Travis that the mist was\ncurling about him; he could no longer see the archway through which he\nhad entered the valley.\n\n\"Naye'nezyani--Slayer of Monsters--give strength to the bow arm, to the\nknife wrist!\" Out of what long-buried memory did that ancient plea come?\nTravis was hardly aware of the sense of the words until he spoke them\naloud. \"You who wait--_shi inday to-dah ishan_--an Apache is not food\nfor you! I am Fox of the Itcatcudnde'yu--the Eagle People; and beside me\nwalk _ga'ns_ of power....\"\n\nTravis blinked and shook his head as one waking. Why had he spoken so,\nusing words and phrases which were not part of any modern speech?\n\nHe moved on, around the base of the first tower, to find no door, no\nbreak in its surface below the second-story windows--to the next\nstructure and the next, until he had encircled all three. If he were to\nenter any, he must find a way of reaching the lowest windows.\n\nOn he went to the other opening of the valley, the one which gave upon\nthe territory of the Tatar camp. But he did not sight any of the Mongols\nas he hacked down a sapling, trimmed, and smoothed it into a\nblunt-pointed lance. His sash-belt, torn into even strips and knotted\ntogether, gave him a rope which he judged would be barely long enough\nfor his purpose.\n\nThen Travis made a chancy cast for the lower window of the nearest\ntower. On the second try the lance slipped in, and he gave a quick jerk,\njamming the lance as a bar across the opening. It was a frail ladder but\nthe best he could improvise. He climbed until the sill of the window was\nwithin reach and he could pull himself up and over.\n\nThe sill was a wide one, at least a twenty-four-inch span between the\ninner and outer surface of the tower. Travis sat there for a minute,\nreluctant to enter. Near the end of his dangling scarf-rope the two\ncoyotes lay on the pavement, their heads up, their tongues lolling from\ntheir mouths, their expressions ones of detached interest.\n\nPerhaps it was the width of the outer wall that subdued the amount of\nlight in the room. The chamber was circular, and directly opposite him\nwas a second window, the lowest of the matching diamond pattern. He took\nthe four-foot drop from the sill to the floor but lingered in the light\nas he surveyed every inch of the room. There were no furnishings at all,\nbut in the very center sank a well of darkness. A smooth pillar, glowing\nfaintly, rose from its core. Travis' adjusting eyes noted how the light\ncame in small ripples--green and purple, over a foundation shade of dark\nblue.\n\nThe pillar seemed rooted below and it extended up through a similar\nopening in the ceiling, providing the only possible exit up or down,\nsave for climbing from window to window outside. Travis moved slowly to\nthe well. Underfoot was a smooth surface overlaid with a velvet carpet\nof dust which arose in languid puffs as he walked. Here and there he\nsighted prints in the dust, strange triangular wedges which he thought\nmight possibly have been made by the claws of birds. But there were no\nother footprints. This tower had been undisturbed for a long, long time.\n\nHe came to the well and looked down. There was dark there, dark in which\nthe pulsations of light from the pillar shown the stronger. But that\nglow did not extend beyond the edge of the well through which the thick\nrod threaded. Even by close examination he could detect no break in the\nsmooth surface of the pillar, nothing remotely resembling hand- or\nfootholds. If it did serve the purpose of a staircase, there were no\ntreads.\n\nAt last Travis put out his hand to touch the surface of the pillar. And\nthen he jerked back--to no effect. There was no breaking contact between\nhis fingers and an unknown material which had the sleekness of polished\nmetal but--and the thought made him slightly queasy--the warmth and very\nslight give of flesh!\n\nHe summoned all his strength to pull free and could not. Not only did\nthat hold grip him, but his other hand and arm were being drawn to join\nthe first! Inside Travis primitive fears awoke full force, and he threw\nback his head, voicing a cry of panic as wild as that of a hunting\nbeast.\n\nAn instant later, his left palm was as tight a prisoner as his right.\nAnd with both hands so held, his whole body was suddenly snapped\nforward, off the safe foundation of the floor, tight to the pillar.\n\nIn this position he was sucked down into the well. And while unable to\nfree himself from the pillar, he did slip along its length easily\nenough. Travis shut his eyes in an involuntary protest against this\nweird form of capture, and a shiver ran through his body as he continued\nto descend.\n\nAfter the first shock had subsided the Apache realized that he was not\ntruly falling at all. Had the pillar been horizontal instead of\nvertical, he would have gauged its speed that of a walk. He passed\nthrough two more room enclosures; he must already be below the level of\nthe valley floor outside. And he was still a prisoner of the pillar, now\nin total darkness.\n\nHis feet came down against a level surface, and he guessed he must have\nreached the end. Again he pulled back, arching his shoulders in a final\ndesperate attempt at escape, and stumbled away as he was released.\n\nHe came up sideways against a wall and stood there panting. The light,\nwhich might have come from the pillar but which seemed more a part of\nthe very air, was bright enough to reveal that he was in a corridor\nrunning into greater dark both right and left.\n\nTravis took two strides back to the pillar, fitted his palms once again\nto its surface, with no result. This time his flesh did not adhere and\nthere was no possible way for him to climb that slick pole. He could\nonly hope that at some point the corridor would give him access to the\nsurface. But which way to go--?\n\nAt last he chose the right-hand path and started along it, pausing every\nfew steps to listen. But there was no sound except the soft pad of his\nown feet. The air was fresh enough, and he thought he could detect a\nfaint current coming toward him from some point ahead--perhaps an exit.\n\nInstead, he came into a room and a small gasp of astonishment was wrung\nout of him. The walls were blank, covered with the same ripples of\nblue-purple-green light which colored the pillar. Just before him was a\ntable and behind it a bench, both carved from the native yellow-red\nmountain rock. And there was no exit except the doorway in which he now\nstood.\n\nTravis walked to the bench. Immovable, it was placed so that whoever sat\nthere must face the opposite wall of the chamber with the table before\nhim. And on the table was an object Travis recognized immediately from\nhis voyage in the alien star ship, one of the reader-viewers through\nwhich the involuntary explorers had learned what little they knew of the\nolder galactic civilization.\n\nA reader--and beside it a box of tapes. Travis touched the edge of that\nbox gingerly, half expecting it to crumble into nothingness. This was a\nplace long deserted. Stone table, bench, the towers could survive\nthrough centuries of abandonment, but these other objects....\n\nThe substance of the reader was firm under the film of dust; there was\nless dust here than had been in the upper tower chamber. Hardly knowing\nwhy, Travis threw one leg over the bench and sat down behind the table,\nthe reader before him, the box of tapes just beyond his hand.\n\nHe surveyed the walls and then looked away hurriedly. The rippling\ncolors caught at his eyes. He had a feeling that if he watched that ebb\nand flow too long, he would be captured in some subtle web of\nenchantment just as the Reds' machine had caught and held the Tatars. He\nturned his attention to the reader. It was, he believed, much like the\none they had used on the ship.\n\nThis room, table, bench, had all been designed with a set purpose. And\nthat purpose--Travis' fingers rested on the box of tapes he could not\nyet bring himself to open--that purpose was to use the reader, he would\nswear to that. Tapes so left must have had a great importance for those\nwho left them. It was as if the whole valley was a trap to channel a\nstranger into this underground chamber.\n\nTravis snapped open the box, fed the first disk into the reader, and\napplied his eyes to the vision tube at its apex.\n\nThe rippling walls looked just the same when he looked up once more, but\nthe cramp in his muscles told Travis that time had passed--perhaps hours\ninstead of minutes--since he had taken out the first disk. He cupped his\nhands over his eyes and tried to think clearly. There had been sheets of\nmeaningless symbol writing, but also there had been many clear,\nthree-dimensional pictures, accompanied by a singsong commentary in an\nalien tongue, seemingly voiced out of thin air. He had been stuffed with\nragged bits and patches of information, to be connected only by guesses,\nand some wild guesses, too. But this much he did know--these towers had\nbeen built by the bald spacemen, and they were highly important to that\nvanished stellar civilization. The information in this room, as\ndisjointed as it had been for him, led to a treasure trove on Topaz\ngreater than he had dreamed.\n\nTravis swayed on the bench. To know so much and yet so little! If Ashe\nwere only here, or some other of the project technicians! A treasure\nsuch as Pandora's box had been, peril for one who opened it and did not\nunderstand. The Apache studied the three walls of blue-purple-green in\nturn and with new attention. There were ways through those walls; he was\nfairly sure he could unlock at least one of them. But not now--certainly\nnot now!\n\nAnd there was another thing he knew: The Reds must _not_ find this. Such\na discovery on their part would not only mean the end of his own people\non Topaz, but the end of Terra as well. This could be a new and alien\nBlack Death spread to destroy whole nations at a time!\n\nIf he could--much as his archaeologist's training would argue against\nit--he would blot out this whole valley above and below ground. But\nwhile the Reds might possess a means of such destruction, the Apaches\ndid not. No, he and his people must prevent its discovery by the enemy\nby doing what he had seen as necessary from the first--wiping out the\nRed leaders! And that must be done before they chanced upon the towers!\n\nTravis arose stiffly. His eyes ached, his head felt stuffed with\npictures, hints, speculations. He wanted to get out, back into the open\nair where perhaps the clean winds of the heights would blow some of\nthis frightening half knowledge from his benumbed mind. He lurched down\nthe corridor, puzzled now by the problem of getting back to the window\nlevel.\n\nHere, before him, was the pillar. Without hope, but still obeying some\nburied instinct, Travis again set his hands to its surface. There was a\ntug at his cramped arms; once more his body was sucked to the pillar.\nThis time he was rising!\n\nHe held his breath past the first level and then relaxed. The principle\nof this weird form of transportation was entirely beyond his\nunderstanding, but as long as it worked in reverse he didn't care to\nfind out. He reached the windowed chamber, but the sunlight had left it;\ninstead, the clean cut of moon sweep lay on the dusty floor. He must\nhave been hours in that underground place.\n\nTravis pulled away from the embrace of the pillar. The bar of his wooden\nlance was still across the window and he ran for it. To catch the\nscouting party at the pass he must hurry. The report they would make to\nthe clan now had to be changed radically in the face of his new\ndiscoveries. The Apaches dared not retreat southward and withdraw from\nthe fight, leaving the Reds to use what treasure lay here.\n\nAs he hit the pavement below he looked about for the coyotes. Then he\ntried the mind call. But as mysteriously as they had met him in the\nvalley, so now were they gone again. And Travis had no time to hunt for\nthem. With a sigh, he began his race to the pass.\n\nIn the old days, Travis remembered, Apache warriors had been able to\ncover forty-five or fifty miles a day on foot and over rough territory.\nBut perhaps his modern breeding had slowed him. He had been so sure he\ncould catch up before the others were through the pass. But he stood now\nin the hollow where they had camped, read the sign of overturned stone\nand bent twig left for him, and knew they would reach the rancheria and\nreport the decision Deklay and the others wanted before he could head\nthem off.\n\nTravis slogged on. He was so tired now that only the drug from the\nsustenance tablets he mouthed at intervals kept him going at a dogged\npace, hardly more than a swift walk. And always his mind was haunted by\nfragments of pictures, pictures he had seen in the reader. The big bomb\nhad been the nightmare of his own world for so long, and what was that\nagainst the forces the bald star rovers had been able to command?\n\nHe fell beside a stream and slept. There was sunshine about him as he\narose to stagger on. What day was this? How long had he sat in the tower\nchamber? He was not sure of time any more. He only knew that he must\nreach the rancheria, tell his story, somehow win over Deklay and the\nother reactionaries to prove the necessity for invading the north in\nforce.\n\nA rocky point which was a familiar landmark came into focus. He padded\non, his chest heaving, his breath whistling through parched, sun-cracked\nlips. He did not know that his face was now a mask of driven resolution.\n\n\"Hahhhhhh--\"\n\nThe cry reached his dulled ears. Travis lifted his head, saw the men\nbefore him and tried to think what that show of weapons turned toward\nhim could mean.\n\nA stone thudded to earth only inches before his feet, to be followed by\nanother. He wavered to a stop.\n\n\"_Ni'ilgac_--!\"\n\nWitch? Where was a witch? Travis shook his head. There was no witch.\n\n\"_Do ne'ilka da_'!\"\n\nThe old death threat, but why--for whom?\n\nAnother stone, this one hitting him in the ribs with force enough to\nsend him reeling back and down. He tried to get up again, saw Deklay\ngrin widely and take aim--and at last Travis realized what was\nhappening.\n\nThen there was a bursting pain in his head and he was falling--falling\ninto a well of black, this time with no pillar of blue to guide him.\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\nThe rasp of something wet and rough, persistent against his cheek;\nTravis tried to turn his head to avoid the contact and was answered by a\nburst of pain which trailed off into a giddiness, making him fear\nanother move, no matter how minor. He opened his eyes and saw the\npointed ears, the outline of a coyote head between him and a dull gray\nsky, was able to recognize Nalik'ideyu.\n\nA wetness other than that from the coyote's tongue slid down his\nforehead now. The dull clouds overhead had released the first heavy rain\nTravis had experienced since their landing on Topaz. He shivered as the\nchill damp of his clothes made him aware that he must have been lying\nout in the full force of the downpour for some time.\n\nIt was a struggle to get to his knees, but Nalik'ideyu mouthed a hold on\nhis shirt, tugging and pulling so that somehow he crept into a hollow\nbeneath the branches of a tree where the spouting water was lessened to\na few pattering drops.\n\nThere the Apache's strength deserted him again and he could only hunch\nover, his bent knees against his chest, trying to endure the throbbing\nmisery in his head, the awful floating sensation which followed any\nmovement. Fighting against that, he tried to remember just what had\nhappened.\n\nThe meeting with Deklay and at least four or five others ... then the\nApache accusation of witchcraft, a serious thing in the old days. Old\ndays! To Deklay and his fellows, these _were_ the old days! And the\nthreat that Deklay or some other had shouted at him--\"_Do ne'ilka\nda'_\"--meant literally: \"It won't dawn for you--death!\"\n\nStones, the last thing Travis remembered were the stones. Slowly his\nhands went out to explore his body. There was more than one bruised area\non his shoulders and ribs, even on his thighs. He must still have been a\ntarget after he had fallen under the stone which had knocked him\nunconscious. Stoned ... outlawed! But why? Surely Deklay's hostility\ncould not have swept Buck, Jil-Lee, Tsoay, even Nolan, into agreeing to\nthat? Now he could not think straight.\n\nTravis became aware of warmth, not only of warmth and the soft touch of\na furred body by his side, but a comforting communication of mind, a\nfeeling he had no words to describe adequately. Nalik'ideyu was sitting\ncrowded against him, her nose thrust up to rest on his shoulder. She\nbreathed in soft puffs which stirred the loose locks of his rain-damp\nhair. And now he flung one arm about her, a gesture which brought a\nwhisper of answering whine.\n\nHe was past wondering about the actions of the coyotes, only supremely\nthankful for Nalik'ideyu's present companionship. And a moment later\nwhen her mate squeezed under the low loop of a branch and joined them\nin this natural wickiup, Travis held out his other hand, drew it\nlovingly across Naginlta's wet hide.\n\n\"Now what?\" he asked aloud. Deklay could only have taken such a drastic\naction with the majority of the clan solidly behind him. It could well\nbe that this reactionary was the new chief, this act of Travis'\nexpulsion merely adding to Deklay's growing prestige.\n\nThe shivering which had begun when Travis recovered consciousness, still\nshook him at intervals. Back on Terra, like all the others in the team,\nhe had had every inoculation known to the space physicians, including\nseveral experimental ones. But the cold virus could still practically\nimmobilize a man, and this was no time to give body room to chills and\nfever.\n\nCatching his breath as his movements touched to life the pain in one\nbruise after another, Travis peeled off his soaked clothing, rubbed his\nbody dry with handfuls of last year's leaves culled from the thick\ncarpet under him, knowing there was nothing he could do until the\nwhirling in his head disappeared. So he burrowed into the leaves until\nonly his head was uncovered, and tried to sleep, the coyotes curling up\none on either side of his nest.\n\nHe dreamed but later could not remember any incident from those dreams,\nsave a certain frustration and fear. When he awoke, again to the sound\nof steady rain, it was dark. He reached out--both coyotes were gone. His\nhead was clearer and suddenly he knew what must be done. As soon as his\nbody was strong enough, he, too, would return to instincts and customs\nof the past. This situation was desperate enough for him to challenge\nDeklay.\n\nIn the dark Travis frowned. He was slightly taller, and three or four\nyears younger than his enemy. But Deklay had the advantage in a stouter\nbuild and longer reach. However, Travis was sure that in his present\nlife Deklay had never fought a duel--Apache fashion. And an Apache duel\nwas not a meeting anyone entered into lightly. Travis had the right to\nenter the rancheria and deliver such a challenge. Then Deklay must meet\nhim or admit himself in the wrong. That part of it was simple.\n\nBut in the past such duels had just one end, a fatal one for at least\none of the fighters. If Travis took this trail, he must be prepared to\ngo the limit. And he didn't want to kill Deklay! There were too few of\nthem here on Topaz to make any loss less than a real catastrophe. While\nhe had no liking for Deklay, neither did he nurse any hatred. However,\nhe must challenge the other or remain a tribal outcast; and Travis had\nno right to gamble with time and the future, not after what he had\nlearned in the tower. It might be his life and skill, or Deklay's,\nagainst the blotting out of them all--and their home world into the\nbargain.\n\nFirst, he must locate the present camp of the clan. If Nolan's arguments\nhad counted, they would be heading south away from the pass. And to\nfollow would draw him farther from the tower valley. Travis' battered\nface ached as he grinned bitterly. This was another time when a man\ncould wish he were two people, a scout on sentry duty at the valley, the\nfighter heading in the opposite direction to have it out with Deklay.\nBut since he was merely one man he would have to gamble on time, one of\nthe trickiest risks of all.\n\nBefore dawn Nalik'ideyu returned, carrying with her a bird--or at least\nbirds must have been somewhere in the creature's ancestry, but the\npresent representative of its kind had only vestigial remnants of wings,\nits trailing feet and legs well developed and far more powerful.\n\nTravis skinned the corpse, automatically putting aside some spine quills\nto feather future arrows. Then he ate slivers of dusky meat raw,\nthrowing the bones to Nalik'ideyu.\n\nThough he was still stiff and sore, Travis was determined to be on his\nway. He tried mind contact with the coyote, picturing the Apaches,\nnotably Deklay, as sharply as he could by mental image. And her assent\nwas clear in return. She and her mate were willing to lead him to the\ntribe. He gave a light sigh of relief.\n\nAs he slogged on through the depressing drizzle, the Apache wondered\nagain why the coyotes had left him before and waited in the tower\nvalley. What link was there between the animals of Terra and the remains\nof the long-ago empire of the stars? For he was certain it was not by\nchance that Nalik'ideyu and Naginlta had lingered in that misty place.\nHe longed to communicate with them directly, to ask questions and be\nanswered.\n\nWithout their aid, Travis would never have been able to track the clan.\nThe drizzle alternated with slashing bursts of rain, torrential enough\nto drive the trackers to the nearest cover. Overhead the sky was either\ndull bronze or night black. Even the coyotes paced nose to ground, often\nmaking wide casts for the trail while Travis waited.\n\nThe rain lasted for three days and nights, filling watercourses with\nrapidly rising streams. Travis could only hope that the others were\nhaving the same difficulty traveling that he was, perhaps the more so\nsince they were burdened with packs. The fact that they kept on meant\nthat they were determined to get as far from the northern mountains as\nthey could.\n\nOn the fourth morning the bronze of the clouds slowly thinned into the\nusual gold, and the sun struck across hills where mist curled like steam\nfrom a hundred bubbling pots. Travis relaxed in the welcome warmth,\nfeeling his shirt dry on his shoulders. It was still a waterlogged\nterrain ahead which should continue to slow the clan. He had high\nexpectations of catching up with them soon, and now the worst of his\nbruises had faded. His muscles were limber, and he had worked out his\nplan as best he could.\n\nTwo hours later he sat in ambush, waiting for the scout who was walking\ninto his hands. Under the direction of the coyotes, Travis had circled\nthe line of march, come in ahead of the clan. Now he needed an emissary\nto state his challenge, and the fact that the scout he was about to jump\nwas Manulito, one of Deklay's supporters, suited Travis' purpose\nperfectly. He gathered his feet under him as the other came opposite,\nand sprang.\n\nThe rush carried Manulito off his feet and face down on the sod while\nTravis made the best of his advantage and pinned the wildly fighting man\nunder him. Had it been one of the older braves he might not have been so\nsuccessful, but Manulito was still a boy by Apache standards.\n\n\"Lie still!\" Travis ordered. \"Listen well--so you can say to Deklay the\nwords of the Fox!\"\n\nThe frenzied struggles ceased. Manulito managed to wrench his head to\nthe left so he could see his captor. Travis loosened his grip, got to\nhis feet. Manulito sat up, his face darkly sullen, but he did not reach\nfor his knife.\n\n\"You will say this to Deklay: The Fox says he is a man of little sense\nand less courage, preferring to throw stones rather than meet knife to\nknife as does a warrior. If he thinks as a warrior, let him prove\nit--his strength against my strength--after the ways of the People!\"\n\nSome of the sullenness left Manulito's expression. He was eager,\nexcited.\n\n\"You would duel with Deklay after the old custom?\"\n\n\"I would. Say this to Deklay, openly so that all men may hear. Then\nDeklay must also give answer openly.\"\n\nManulito flushed at that implication concerning his leader's courage,\nand Travis knew that he would deliver the challenge openly. To keep his\nhold on the clan the latter must accept it, and there would be an\naudience of his people to witness the success or defeat of their new\nchief and his policies.\n\nAs Manulito disappeared Travis summoned the coyotes, putting full effort\ninto getting across one message. Any tribe led by Deklay would be\nhostile to the mutant animals. They must go into hiding, run free in the\nwilderness if the gamble failed Travis. Now they withdrew into the\nbushes but not out of reach of his mind.\n\nHe did not have too long to wait. First came Jil-Lee, Buck, Nolan,\nTsoay, Lupe--those who had been with him on the northern scout. Then the\nothers, the warriors first, the women making a half circle behind,\nleaving a free space in which Deklay walked.\n\n\"I am the Fox,\" Travis stated. \"And this one has named me witch and\n_natdahe_, outlaw of the mountains. Therefore do I come to name names in\nmy turn. Hear me, People: This Deklay--he would walk among you as\n_'izesnantan_, a great chief--but he does not have the _go'ndi_, the\nholy power of a chief. For this Deklay is a fool, with a head filled by\nnothing but his own wishes, not caring for his clan brothers. He says he\nleads you into safety; I say he leads you into the worst danger any\nliving man can imagine--even in peyote dreams! He is one twisted in his\nthoughts, and he would make you twisted also----\"\n\nBuck cut in sharply, hushing the murmur of the massed clan.\n\n\"These are bold words, Fox. Will you back them?\"\n\nTravis' hands were already peeling off his shirt. \"I will back them,\" he\nstated between set teeth. He had known since his awakening after the\nstoning that this next move was the only one left for him to make. But\nnow that the testing of his action came, he could not be certain of the\noutcome, of anything save that the final decision of this battle might\naffect more than the fate of two men. He stripped, noting that Deklay\nwas doing the same.\n\nHaving stepped into the center of the glade, Nolan was using the point\nof his knife to score a deep-ridged circle there. Naked except for his\nmoccasins, with only his knife in his hand, Travis took the two strides\nwhich put him in the circle facing Deklay. He surveyed his opponent's\nfinely muscled body, realizing that his earlier estimate of Deklay's\nprobable advantages were close to the mark. In sheer strength the other\noutmatched him. Whether Deklay was skillful with his knife was another\nquestion, one which Travis would soon be able to answer.\n\nThey circled, eyes intent upon each move, striving to weigh and measure\neach other's strengths and weaknesses. Knife dueling among the\nPinda-lick-o-yi, Travis remembered, had once been an art close to\nfinished swordplay, with two evenly matched fighters able to engage for\na long time without seriously marking each other. But this was a far\nrougher and more deadly game, with none of the niceties of such a\nmeeting.\n\nHe evaded a vicious thrust from Deklay.\n\n\"The bull charges,\" he laughed. \"And the Fox snaps!\" By some incredible\nstroke of good fortune, the point of his weapon actually grazed Deklay's\narm, drawing a thin, red inch-long line across the skin.\n\n\"Charge again, bull. Feel once more the Fox's teeth!\"\n\nHe strove to goad Deklay into a crippling loss of temper, knowing how\nthe other could explode into violent rage. It was dangerous, that rage,\nbut it could also make a man blindly careless.\n\nThere was an inarticulate sound from Deklay, a dusky swelling in the\nman's face. He spat, as might an enraged puma, and rushed at Travis who\ndid not quite manage to avoid the lunge, falling back with a smarting\nslash across the ribs.\n\n\"The bull gores!\" Deklay bellowed. \"Horns toss the Fox!\"\n\nHe rushed again, elated by the sight of the trickling wound on Travis'\nside. But the slighter man slipped away.\n\nTravis knew he must be careful in such evasions. One foot across the\nridged circle and he was finished as much as if Deklay's blade had found\nits mark. Travis tried a thrust of his own, and his foot came down hard\non a sharp pebble. Through the sole of his moccasin pain shot upward,\ncaused him to stumble. Again the scarlet flame of a wound, down his\nshoulder and forearm this time.\n\nWell, there was one trick, he knew. Travis tossed the knife into the\nair, caught it with his left hand. Deklay was now facing a left-handed\nfighter and must adjust to that.\n\n\"Paw, bull, rattle your horns!\" Travis cried. \"The Fox still shows his\nteeth!\"\n\nDeklay recovered from his instant of surprise. With a cry which was\nindeed like the bellow of an old range bull, he rushed into grapple,\nsure of his superior strength against a younger and already wounded man.\n\nTravis ducked, one knee thumping the ground. He groped out with his\nright hand, caught up a handful of earth, and flung it into the dusky\nbrown face. Again it seemed that luck was on his side. That handful\ncould not be as blinding as sand, but some bit of the shower landed in\nDeklay's eye.\n\nFor a space of seconds Deklay was wide open--open for a blow which would\nrip him up the middle, the blow Travis could not and would not deliver.\n\nInstead, he took the offensive recklessly, springing straight for his\nopponent. As the earth-grimed fingers of one hand clawed into Deklay's\nface, he struck with the other, not with the point of the knife but with\nits shaft. But Deklay, already only half conscious from the blow, had\nhis own chance. He fell to the ground, leaving his knife behind, two\ninches of steel between Travis' ribs.\n\nSomehow--he didn't know from where he drew that strength--Travis kept\nhis feet and took one step and then another, out of the circle until the\ncomforting brace of a tree trunk was against his bare back. Was he\nfinished--?\n\nHe fought to nurse his rags of consciousness. Had he summoned Buck with\nhis eyes? Or had the urgency of what he had to say reached somehow from\nmind to mind? The other was at his side, but Travis put out a hand to\nward him off.\n\n\"Towers--\" He struggled to keep his wits through the pain and billowing\nweakness beginning to creep through him. \"Reds mustn't get to the\ntowers! Worse than the bomb ... end us all!\"\n\nHe had a hazy glimpse of Nolan and Jil-Lee closing in about him. The\ndesire to cough tore at him, but they had to know, to believe....\n\n\"Reds get to the towers--everything finished. Not only here ... maybe\nback home too....\"\n\nDid he read comprehension on Buck's face? Would Nolan and Jil-Lee and\nthe rest believe him? Travis could not suppress the cough any longer,\nand the ripping pain which followed was the worst he had ever\nexperienced. But still he kept his feet, tried to make them understand.\n\n\"Don't let them get to the towers. Find that storehouse!\"\n\nTravis stood away from the tree, reached out to Buck his earth and\nbloodstained hand. \"I swear ... truth ... this must be done!\"\n\nHe was going down, and he had a queer thought that once he reached the\nground everything would end, not only for him but also for his mission.\nTrying to see the faces of the men about him was like attempting to\nidentify the people in a dream.\n\n\"Towers!\" He had meant to shout it, but he could not even hear for\nhimself that last word as he fell.\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\nTravis' back was braced against blanketed packs as he steadied a piece\nof light-yellow bark against one bent knee scowling at the lines drawn\non it in faint green.\n\n\"We are here then ... and the ship there--\" His thumb was set on one\npoint of the crude map, forefinger on the other. Buck nodded.\n\n\"That is so. Tsoay, Eskelta, Kawaykle, they watch the trails. There is\nthe pass, two other ways men can come on foot. But who can watch the\nair?\"\n\n\"The Tatars say the Reds dare not bring the 'copter into the mountains.\nAfter they first landed they lost a flyer in a tricky air-current flow\nup there. They have only one left and won't risk it. If only they aren't\nreinforced before we can move!\" There it was again, that constant\ngnawing fear of time, time shortening into a rope to strangle them all.\n\n\"You think that the knowledge of our ship will bring them into the\nopen?\"\n\n\"That--or information about the towers would be the only things\nimportant enough to pull out their experts. They could send a controlled\nTatar party to explore the ship, sure. But that wouldn't give them the\ntechnical reports they need. No, I think if they knew a wrecked Western\nConfederation ship was here, it would bring them--or enough of them to\nlessen the odds. We have to catch them in the open. Otherwise, they can\nhole up forever in that ship-fort of theirs.\"\n\n\"And just how do we let them know our ship is here? Send out another\nscouting party and let them be trailed back?\"\n\n\"That's our last resource.\" Travis continued to frown at the map. Yes,\nit would be possible to let the Reds sight and trail an Apache party.\nBut there was none in the clan who were expendable. Surely there was\nsome other way of laying the trap with the wrecked ship for bait.\nCapture one of the Reds, let him escape again, having seen what they\nwanted him to see? Again a time-wasting business. And how long would\nthey have to wait and what risks would they take to pick up a Red\nprisoner?\n\n\"If the Tatars were dependable....\" Buck was thinking aloud.\n\nBut that \"if\" was far too big. They could not trust the Tatars. No\nmatter how much the Mongols wanted to aid in pulling down the Reds, as\nlong as they could be controlled by the caller they were useless. Or\nwere they?\n\n\"Thought of something?\" Buck must have caught Travis' change of\nexpression.\n\n\"Suppose a Tatar saw our ship and then was picked up by a Red hunting\npatrol and they got the information out of him?\"\n\n\"Do you think any outlaw would volunteer to let himself be picked up\nagain? And if he did, wouldn't the Reds also be able to learn that he\nhad been set up for the trap?\"\n\n\"An escaped prisoner?\" Travis suggested.\n\nNow Buck was plainly considering the possibilities of such a scheme. And\nTravis' own spirits rose a little. The idea was full of holes, but it\ncould be worked out. Suppose they capture, say, Menlik, bring him here\nas a prisoner, let him think they were about to kill him because of that\nattack back in the foothills. Then let him escape, pursue him northward\nto a point where he could be driven into the hands of the Reds? Very\nchancy, but it just might work. Travis was favoring a gamble now, since\nhis desperate one with the duel had paid off.\n\nThe risk he had accepted then had cost him two deep wounds, one of which\nmight have been serious if Jil-Lee's project-sponsored medical training\nhad not been to hand. But it had also made Travis one of the clan again,\nwith his people willing to listen to his warning concerning the tower\ntreasury.\n\n\"The girl--the Tatar girl!\"\n\nAt first Travis did not understand Buck's ejaculation.\n\n\"We get the girl,\" the other elaborated, \"let her escape, then hunt her\nto where they'll pick her up. Might even imprison her in the ship to\nbegin with.\"\n\nKaydessa? Though something within him rebelled at that selection for the\nleading role in their drama, Travis could see the advantage of Buck's\nchoice. Woman-stealing was an ancient pastime among primitive cultures.\nThe Tatars themselves had found wives that way in the past, just as the\nApache raiders of old had taken captive women into their wickiups. Yes,\nfor raiders to steal a woman would be a natural act, accepted as such\nby the Reds. For the same woman to endeavor to escape and be hunted by\nher captors also was reasonable. And for such a woman, cut off from her\noutlaw kin, to eventually head back toward the Red settlement as the\nonly hope of evading her enemies--logical all the way!\n\n\"She would have to be well frightened,\" Travis observed with reluctance.\n\n\"That can be done for us--\"\n\nTravis glanced at Buck with sharp annoyance. He would not allow certain\ngames out of their common past to be played with Kaydessa. But Buck had\nsomething very different from old-time brutality in mind.\n\n\"Three days ago, while you were still flat on your back, Deklay and I\nwent back to the ship--\"\n\n\"Deklay?\"\n\n\"You beat him openly, so he must restore his honor in his own sight. And\nthe council has forbidden another duel or challenge,\" Buck replied.\n\"Therefore he will continue to push for recognition in another way. And\nnow that he has heard your story and knows we must face the Reds, not\nrun from them, he is eager to take the war trail--too eager. So we\nreturned to the ship to make another search for weapons----\"\n\n\"There were none there before except those we had....\"\n\n\"Nor now either. But we discovered something else.\" Buck paused and\nTravis was shaken out of his absorption with the problem at hand by a\nnote in the other's voice. It was as if Buck had come upon something he\ncould not summon the right words to describe.\n\n\"First,\" Buck continued, \"there was this dead thing there, near where\nwe found Dr. Ruthven. It was something like a man ... but all silvery\nhair----\"\n\n\"The ape-things! The ape-things from the other worlds! What else did you\nsee?\" Travis had dropped the map. His side gave him a painful twinge as\nhe caught at Buck's sleeve. The bald space rovers--did they still exist\nhere somewhere? Had they come to explore the ship built on the pattern\nof their own but manned by Terrans?\n\n\"Nothing except tracks, a lot of them, in every open cabin and hole. I\nthink there must have been a sizable pack of the things.\"\n\n\"What killed the dead one?\"\n\nBuck wet his lips. \"I think--fear....\" His voice dropped a little,\nalmost apologetically, and Travis stared.\n\n\"The ship is changed. Inside, there is something wrong. When you walk\nthe corridors your skin crawls, you think there is something behind you.\nYou hear things, see things from the corners of your eyes.... When you\nturn, there's nothing, nothing at all! And the higher you climb into the\nship, the worse it is. I tell you, Travis, never have I felt anything\nlike it before!\"\n\n\"It was a ship of many dead,\" Travis reminded him. Had the age-old\nApache fear of the dead been activated by the Redax into an acute\nphobia--to strike down such a level-headed man as Buck?\n\n\"No, at first that, too, was my thought. Then I discovered that it was\nworst not near that chamber where we lay our dead, but higher, in the\nRedax cabin. I think perhaps the machine is still running, but running\nin a wrong way--so that it does not awaken old memories of our\nancestors now, but brings into being all the fears which have ever\nhaunted us through the dark of the ages. I tell you, Travis, when I came\nout of that place Deklay was leading me by the hand as if I were a\nchild. And he was shivering as a man who will never be warm again. There\nis an evil there beyond our understanding. I think that this Tatar girl,\nwere she only to stay there a very short time, would be well\nfrightened--so frightened that any trained scientist examining her later\nwould know there was a mystery to be explored.\"\n\n\"The ape-things--could they have tried to run the Redax?\" Travis\nwondered. To associate machines with the creatures was outwardly pure\nfolly. But they had been discovered on two of the planets of the old\ncivilization, and Ashe had thought that they might represent the\ndegenerate remnants of a once intelligent species.\n\n\"That is possible. If so, they raised a storm which drove them out and\nkilled one of them. The ship is a haunted place now.\"\n\n\"But for us to use the girl....\" Travis had seen the logic in Buck's\nfirst suggestion, but now he differed. If the atmosphere of the ship was\nas terrifying as Buck said, to imprison Kaydessa there, even\ntemporarily, was still wrong.\n\n\"She need not remain long. Suppose we should do this: We shall enter\nwith her and then allow the disturbance we would feel to overcome us. We\ncould run, leave her alone. When she left the ship, we could then take\nup the chase, shepherding her back to the country she knows. Within the\nship we would be with her and could see she did not remain too long.\"\n\nTravis could see a good prospect in that plan. There was one thing he\nwould insist on--if Kaydessa was to be in that ship, he himself would be\none of the \"captors.\" He said as much, and Buck accepted his\ndetermination as final.\n\nThey dispatched a scouting party to infiltrate the territory to the\nnorth, to watch and wait their chance of capture. Travis strove to\nregain his feet, to be ready to move when the moment came.\n\nFive days later he was able to reach the ridge beyond which lay the\nwrecked ship. With him were Jil-Lee, Lupe, and Manulito. They satisfied\nthemselves that the globe had had no visitors since Buck and Deklay;\nthere was no sign that the ape-things had returned.\n\n\"From here,\" Travis said, \"the ship doesn't look too bad, almost as if\nit might be able to take off again.\"\n\n\"It might lift,\" Jil-Lee gestured to the mountaintop behind the curve of\nthe globe--\"about that far. The tubes on this side are intact.\"\n\n\"What would happen were the Reds to get inside and try to fly again?\"\nManulito wondered aloud.\n\nTravis was struck by a sudden idea, one perhaps just as wild as the\nother inspirations he had had since landing on Topaz, but one to be\nstudied and explored--not dismissed without consideration. Suppose\nenough power remained to lift the ship partially and then blow it up?\nWith the Red technicians on board at the time.... But he was no\nengineer, he had no idea whether any part of the globe might or might\nnot work again.\n\n\"They are not fools; a close look would tell them it is a wreck,\"\nJil-Lee countered.\n\nTravis walked on. Not too far ahead a yellow-brown shape moved out of\nthe brush, stood stiff-legged in his path, facing the ship and growling\nin a harsh rumble of sound. Whatever moved or operated in that wreck was\npicked up by the acute sense of the coyote, even at this distance.\n\n\"On!\" Travis edged around the snarling animal. With one halting step and\nthen another, it followed him. There was a sharp warning yelp from the\nbrush, and a second coyote head appeared. Naginlta followed Travis, but\nNalik'ideyu refused to approach the grounded globe.\n\nTravis surveyed the ship closely, trying to remember the layout of its\ninterior. To turn the whole sphere into a trap--was it possible? How had\nAshe said the Redax worked? Something about high-frequency waves\nstimulating certain brain and nerve centers.\n\nWhat if one were shielded from those rays? That tear in the side--he\nhimself must have climbed through that the night they crashed. And the\nbreak was not too far from the space lock. Near the lock was a storage\ncompartment. And if it had not been jammed, or its contents crushed,\nthey might have something. He beckoned to Jil-Lee.\n\n\"Give me a hand--up there.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I want to see if the space suits are intact.\"\n\nJil-Lee regarded Travis with open bewilderment, but Manulito pushed\nforward. \"We do not need those suits to walk here, Travis. This air we\ncan breathe--\"\n\n\"Not for the air, and not in the open.\" Travis advanced at a deliberate\npace. \"Those suits may be insulated in more ways than one----\"\n\n\"Against a mixed-up Redax broadcast, you mean!\" Jil-Lee exclaimed.\n\"Yes, but you stay here, younger brother. This is a risky climb, and you\nare not yet strong.\"\n\nTravis was forced to accede to that, waiting as Manulito and Lupe\nclimbed up to the tear and entered. At least Buck and Deklay's\nexperience had forewarned them and they would be prepared for the weird\nghosts haunting the interior.\n\nBut when they returned, pulling between them the limp space suit, both\nmen were pale, the shiny sheen of sweat on their foreheads, their hands\nshaking. Lupe sat down on the ground before Travis.\n\n\"Evil spirits,\" he said, giving to this modern phenomenon the old name.\n\"Truly ghosts and witches walk in there.\"\n\nManulito had spread the suit on the ground and was examining it with a\ncare which spoke of familiarity.\n\n\"This is unharmed,\" he reported. \"Ready to wear.\"\n\nThe suits were all tailored for size, Travis knew. And this fitted a\nslender, medium-sized man. It would fit him, Travis Fox. But Manulito\nwas already unbuckling the fastenings with practiced ease.\n\n\"I shall try it out,\" he announced. And Travis, seeing the awkward climb\nto the entrance of the ship, had to agree that the first test should be\ncarried out by someone more agile at the moment.\n\nSealed into the suit, with the bubble helmet locked in place, the Apache\nclimbed back into the globe. The only form of communication with him was\nthe rope he had tied about him, and if he went above the first level, he\nwould have to leave that behind.\n\nIn the first few moments they saw no twitch of alarm running along the\nrope. After counting fifty slowly, Travis gave it a tentative jerk, to\nfind it firmly fastened within. So Manulito had tied it there and was\nclimbing to the control cabin.\n\nThey continued to wait with what patience they could muster. Naginlta,\npacing up and down a good distance from the ship, whined at intervals,\nthe warning echoed each time by his mate upslope.\n\n\"I don't like it--\" Travis broke off when the helmeted figure appeared\nagain at the break. Moving slowly in his cumbersome clothing, Manulito\nreached the ground, fumbled with the catch of his head covering and then\nstood, taking deep, lung-filling gulps of air.\n\n\"Well?\" Travis demanded.\n\n\"I see no ghosts,\" Manulito said, grinning. \"This is ghost-proof!\" He\nslapped his gloved hand against the covering over his chest. \"There is\nalso this--from what I know of these ships--some of the relays still\nwork. I think this could be made into a trap. We could entice the Reds\nin and then....\" His hand moved in a quick upward flip.\n\n\"But we don't know anything about the engines,\" Travis replied.\n\n\"No? Listen--you, Fox, are not the only one to remember useful\nknowledge.\" Manulito had lost his cheerful grin. \"Do you think we are\njust the savages those big brains back at the project wished us to be?\nThey have played a trick on us with their Redax. So, we can play a few\ntricks, too. Me--? I went to M.I.T., or is that one of the things you no\nlonger remember, Fox?\"\n\nTravis swallowed hastily. He really had forgotten that fact until this\nvery minute. From the beginning, the Apache team had been carefully\nselected and screened, not only for survival potential, which was their\nbasic value to the project, but also for certain individual skills. Just\nas Travis' grounding in archaeology had been one advantage, so had\nManulito's technical training made a valuable, though different,\ncontribution. If at first the Redax, used without warning, had smothered\nthat training, perhaps the effects were now fading.\n\n\"You can do something, then?\" he asked eagerly.\n\n\"I can try. There is a chance to booby trap the control cabin at least.\nAnd that is where they would poke and pry. Working in this suit will be\ntough. How about my trying to smash up the Redax first?\"\n\n\"Not until after we use it on our captive,\" Jil-Lee decided. \"Then there\nwould be some time before the Reds come----\"\n\n\"You talk as if they _will_ come,\" cut in Lupe. \"How can you be sure?\"\n\n\"We can't,\" Travis agreed. \"But we can count on this much, judging from\nthe past. Once they know that there is a wrecked ship here, they will be\nforced to explore it. They cannot afford an enemy settlement on this\nside of the mountains. That would be, according to their way of\nthinking, an eternal threat.\"\n\nJil-Lee nodded. \"That is true. This is a complicated plan, yes, and one\nin which many things may go wrong. But it is also one which covers all\nthe loopholes we know of.\"\n\nWith Lupe's aid Manulito crawled out of the suit. As he leaned it\ncarefully against a supporting rock he said:\n\n\"I have been thinking of this treasure house in the towers. Suppose we\ncould find new weapons there....\"\n\nTravis hesitated. He still shrank from the thought of opening the secret\nplaces behind those glowing walls, to loose a new peril.\n\n\"If we took weapons from there and lost the fight....\" He advanced his\nfirst objection and was glad to see the expression of comprehension on\nJil-Lee's face.\n\n\"It would be putting the weapons straight into Red hands,\" the other\nagreed.\n\n\"We may have to chance it before we're through,\" Manulito warned.\n\"Suppose we do get some of their technicians into this trap. That isn't\ngoing to open up their main defense for us. We may need a bigger\nnutcracker than we've ever seen.\"\n\nWith a return of that queasy feeling he had known in the tower, Travis\nknew Manulito was speaking sense. They might have to open Pandora's box\nbefore the end of this campaign.\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\nThey camped another two days near the wrecked ship while Manulito\nprowled the haunted corridors and cabins in his space suit, planning his\nbooby trap. At night he drew diagrams on pieces of bark and discussed\nthe possibility of this or that device, sometimes lapsing into\ntechnicalities his companions could not follow. But Travis was well\nsatisfied that Manulito knew what he was doing.\n\nOn the morning of the third day Nolan slipped into their midst. He was\ndust-grimed, his face gaunt, the signs of hard travel plain to read.\nTravis handed him the nearest canteen, and they watched him drink\nsparingly in small sips before he spoke.\n\n\"They come ... with the girl--\"\n\n\"You had trouble?\" asked Jil-Lee.\n\n\"The Tatars had moved their camp, which was only wise, since the Reds\nmust have had a line on the other one. And they are now farther to the\nwest. But--\" he wiped his lips with the back of his hand--\"also we saw\nyour towers, Fox. And that is a place of power!\"\n\n\"No sign that the Reds are prowling there?\"\n\nNolan shook his head. \"To my mind the mists there conceal the towers\nfrom aerial view. Only one coming on foot could tell them from the\nnatural crags of the hills.\"\n\nTravis relaxed. Time still granted them a margin of grace. He glanced up\nto see Nolan smiling faintly.\n\n\"This maiden, she is a kin to the puma of the mountains,\" he announced.\n\"She has marked Tsoay with her claws until he looks like the ear-clipped\nyearling fresh from the branding chute----\"\n\n\"She is not hurt?\" Travis demanded.\n\nThis time Nolan chuckled openly. \"Hurt? No, we had much to do to keep\nher from hurting us, younger brother. That one is truly as she claims, a\ndaughter of wolves. And she is also keen-witted, marking a return trail\nall the way, though she does not know that is as we wish. Did we not\npick the easiest way back for just that reason? Yes, she plans to\nescape.\"\n\nTravis stood up. \"Let us finish this quickly!\" His voice came out on a\nrough note. This plan had never had his full approval. Now he found it\nless and less easy to think about taking Kaydessa into the ship,\nallowing the emotional torment lurking there to work upon her. Yet he\nknew that the girl would not be hurt, and he had made sure he would be\nbeside her within the globe, sharing with her the horror of the unseen.\n\nA rattling of gravel down the narrow valley opening gave warning to\nthose by the campfire. Manulito had already stowed the space suit in\nhiding. To Kaydessa they must have seemed reverted entirely to savagery.\n\nTsoay came first, an angry raking of four parallel scratches down his\nleft cheek. And behind him Buck and Eskelta shoved the prisoner, urging\nher on with a show of roughness which did not descend to actual\nbrutality. Her long braids had shaken loose, and a sleeve was torn,\nleaving one slender arm bare. But none of the fighting spirit had left\nher.\n\nThey thrust her out into the circle of waiting men and she planted her\nfeet firmly apart, glaring at them all indiscriminately until she\nsighted Travis. Then her anger became hotter and more deadly.\n\n\"Pig! Rooter in the dirt! Diseased camel--\" she shouted at him in\nEnglish and then reverted to her own tongue, her voice riding up and\ndown the scale. Her hands were tied behind her back, but there were no\nbonds on her tongue.\n\n\"This is one who can speak thunders, and shoot lightnings from her\nmouth,\" Buck commented in Apache. \"Put her well away from the wood, lest\nshe set it aflame.\"\n\nTsoay held his hands over his ears. \"She can deafen a man when she\ncannot set her mark on him otherwise. Let us speedily get rid of her.\"\n\nYet for all their jeering comments, their eyes held respect. Often in\nthe past a defiant captive who stood up boldly to his captors had\nreceived more consideration than usual from Apache warriors; courage was\na quality they prized. A Pinda-lick-o-yi such as Tom Jeffords, who rode\ninto Cochise's camp and sat in the midst of his sworn enemies for a\nparley, won the friendship of the very chief he had been fighting.\nKaydessa had more influence with her captors than she could dream of\nholding.\n\nNow it was time for Travis to play his part. He caught the girl's\nshoulder and pushed her before him toward the wreck.\n\nSome of the spirit seemed to have left her thin, tense body, and she\nwent without any more fight. Only when they came into full view of the\nship did she falter. Travis heard her breathe a gasp of surprise.\n\nAs they had planned, four of the Apaches--Jil-Lee, Tsoay, Nolan, and\nBuck--fanned out toward the heights about the ship. Manulito had already\ngone to cover, to don the space suit and prepare for any accident.\n\nResolutely Travis continued to propel Kaydessa ahead. At the moment he\ndid not know which was worse, to enter the ship expecting the fear to\nstrike, or to meet it unprepared. He was ready to refuse to enter, not\nto allow the girl, sullenly plodding on under his compulsion, to face\nthat unseen but potent danger.\n\nOnly the memory of the towers and the threat of the Reds finding and\nexploiting the treasure there kept him going. Eskelta went first,\nclimbing to the tear. Travis cut the ropes binding Kaydessa's wrists and\ngave her a slight slap between the shoulders.\n\n\"Climb, woman!\" His anxiety made that a harsh order and she climbed.\n\nEskelta was inside now, heading for the cabin which might reasonably be\nselected as a prison. They planned to get the girl as far as that point\nand then stage their act of being overcome by fear, allowing her to\nescape.\n\nStage an act? Travis was not two feet along that corridor before he knew\nthat there would be little acting needed on his part. The thing which\npervaded the ship did not attack sharply, rather it seeped into his mind\nand body as if he drew in poison with every breath, sent it racing\nalong his veins with every beat of a laboring heart. Yet he could not\nput any name to his feelings, except an awful, weakening fear which\nweighted him heavier with every step he took.\n\nKaydessa screamed. Not this time in rage, but with such fervor that\nTravis lost his hold, staggered back to the wall. She whirled about, her\nface contorted, and sprang at him.\n\nIt was indeed like trying to fight a wildcat and after the first second\nor two he was hard put to protect his eyes, his face, his side, without\ninjuring her in return. She scrambled over him, running for the break in\nthe wall, and disappeared. Travis gasped, and started to crawl for the\nbreak. Eskelta loomed over him, pulled him up in haste.\n\nThey reached the opening but did not climb through. Travis was uncertain\nas to whether he could make that descent yet, and Eskelta was obeying\norders in not venturing out too soon.\n\nBelow, the ground was bare. There was no sign of the Apaches, though\nthey were in hiding there--and none of Kaydessa. Travis was amazed that\nshe had vanished so quickly.\n\nStill uneasy from the emanation within, they perched within the shadow\nof the break until Travis thought that the fugitive had a good\nfive-minute start. Then he nodded a signal to Eskelta.\n\nBy the time they reached ground level Travis felt a warm wetness\nspreading under his shielding palm and he knew the wound had opened. He\nspoke a word or two in hot protest against that mishap, knowing it would\nkeep him from the trail. Kaydessa must be covered all the way back\nacross the pass, not only to be shepherded away from her people and\ntoward the plains where she could be picked up by a Red patrol, but also\nto keep her from danger. And he had planned from the first to be one of\nthose shepherds.\n\nNow he was about as much use as a trail-lame pony. However, he could\nsend deputies. He thought out his call, and Nalik'ideyu's head appeared\nin a frame of bush.\n\n\"Go, both of you and run with her! Guard--!\" He said the words in a\nwhisper, thought them with a fierce intensity as he centered his gaze on\nthe yellow eyes in the pointed coyote face. There was a feeling of\nassent, and then the animal was gone. Travis sighed.\n\nThe Apache scouts were subtle and alert, but the coyotes could far outdo\nany man. With Nalik'ideyu and Naginlta flanking her flight, Kaydessa\nwould be well guarded. She would probably never see her guards or know\nthat they were running protection for her.\n\n\"That was a good move,\" Jil-Lee said, coming out of concealment. \"But\nwhat have you done to yourself?\" He stepped closer, pulling Travis' hand\naway from his side. By the time Lupe came to report, Travis was again\nwound in a strapping bandage pulled tightly about his lower ribs, and\nreconciled to the fact that any trailing he would do must be well to the\nrear of the first party.\n\n\"The towers,\" he said to Jil-Lee. \"If our plan works, we can catch part\nof the Reds here. But we still have their ship to take, and for that we\nneed help which we may find at the towers. Or at least we can be on\nguard there if they return with Kaydessa on that path.\"\n\nLupe dropped down lightly from an upper ledge. He was grinning.\n\n\"That woman is one who thinks. She runs from the ship first as a rabbit\nwith a wolf at her heels. Then she begins to think. She climbs--\" He\nlifted one finger to the slope behind them. \"She goes behind a rock to\nwatch under cover. When Fox comes from the ship with Eskelta, again she\nclimbs. Buck lets himself be seen, so she moves east, as we wish--\"\n\n\"And now?\" questioned Travis.\n\n\"She is keeping to the high ways; almost she thinks like one of the\nPeople on the war trail. Nolan believes she will hole up for the night\nsomewhere above. He will make sure.\"\n\nTravis licked his lips. \"She has no food or water.\"\n\nJil-Lee's lips shaped a smile. \"They will see that she comes upon both\nas if by chance. We have planned all of this, as you know, younger\nbrother.\"\n\nThat was true. Travis knew that Kaydessa would be guided without her\nknowledge by the \"accidental\" appearance now and then of some\npursuer--just enough to push her along.\n\n\"Then, too, she is now armed,\" Jil-Lee added.\n\n\"How?\" demanded Travis.\n\n\"Look to your own belt, younger brother. Where is your knife?\"\n\nStartled, Travis glanced down. His sheath was empty, and he had not\nneeded that blade since he had drawn it to cut meat at the morning meal.\nLupe laughed.\n\n\"She had steel in her hand when she came out of that ghost ship.\"\n\n\"Took it from me while we struggled!\" Travis was openly surprised. He\nhad considered the frenzy displayed by the Tatar girl as an outburst of\nalmost mindless terror. Yet Kaydessa had had wit enough to take his\nknife! Could this be another case where one race was less affected by a\nmind machine than the other? Just as the Apaches had not been governed\nby the Red caller, so the Tatars might not be as sensitive to the Redax.\n\n\"She is a strong one, that woman--one worth many ponies.\" Eskelta\nreverted to the old measure of a wife's value.\n\n\"That is true!\" Travis agreed emphatically and then was annoyed at the\nbroadening of Jil-Lee's smile. Abruptly he changed the subject.\n\n\"Manulito is setting the booby trap in the ship.\"\n\n\"That is well. He and Eskelta will remain here, and you with them.\"\n\n\"Not so! We must go to the towers----\" Travis protested.\n\n\"I thought,\" Jil-Lee cut in, \"that you believed the weapons of the old\nones too dangerous for us to use.\"\n\n\"Maybe they will be forced into our hands. But we must be sure the\ntowers are not entered by the Reds on their way here.\"\n\n\"That is reasonable. But for you, younger brother, no trailing today,\nperhaps not tomorrow. If that wound opens again, you might have much bad\ntrouble.\"\n\nTravis was forced to accept that, in spite of his worry and impatience.\nAnd the next day when he did move on he had only the report that\nKaydessa had sheltered beside a pool for the night and was doggedly\nmoving back across the mountains.\n\nThree days later Travis, Jil-Lee, and Buck came into the tower valley.\nKaydessa was in the northern foothills, twice turned back from the west\nand the freedom of the outlaws by the Apache scouts. And only half an\nhour before, Tsoay had reported by mirror what should have been welcome\nnews: the Red helicopter was cruising as it had on the day they watched\nthe hunters enter the uplands. There was an excellent chance of the\nfugitive's being sighted and picked up soon.\n\nTsoay had also spotted a party of three Tatars watching the helicopter.\nBut after one wide sweep of the flyer they had taken to their ponies and\nridden away at the fastest pace their mounts could manage in this rough\nterritory.\n\nOn a stretch of smooth earth Buck scratched a trail, and they studied\nit. The Reds would have to follow this route to seek the wrecked ship--a\nroute covered by Apache sentinels. And following the chain of\ncommunication the result of the trap would be reported to the party at\nthe towers.\n\nThe waiting was the most difficult; too many imponderables did not allow\nfor unemotional thinking. Travis was down to the last shred of patience\nwhen word came on the second morning at the hidden valley that Kaydessa\nhad been picked up by a Red patrol--drawn out to meet them by the\ncaller.\n\n\"Now--the tower weapons!\" Buck answered the report with an imperative\norder to Travis. And the other knew he could no longer postpone the\ninevitable. And only by action could he blot out the haunting mental\npicture of Kaydessa once more drawn into the bondage she so hated.\n\nFlanked by Jil-Lee and Buck, he climbed back through the tower window\nand faced the glowing pillar.\n\nHe crossed the room, put out both hands to the sleek pole, uncertain if\nthe weird transport would work again. He heard the sharp gasp from the\nothers as his body was sucked against the pillar and carried downward\nthrough the well. Buck followed him, and Jil-Lee came last. Then Travis\nled the way along the underground corridor to the room with the table\nand the reader.\n\nHe sat down on the bench, fumbled with the pile of tape disks, knowing\nthat the other two were watching him with almost hostile intentness. He\nsnapped a disk into the reader, hoping he could correctly interpret the\ndirections it gave.\n\nHe looked up at the wall before him. Three ... four steps, the correct\nmove--and then an unlocking....\n\n\"You know?\" Buck demanded.\n\n\"I can guess----\"\n\n\"Well?\" Jil-Lee moved to the table. \"What do we do?\"\n\n\"This--\" Travis came from behind the table, walked to the wall. He put\nout both hands, flattened his palms against the green-blue-purple\nsurface and slid them slowly along. Under his touch, the material of the\nwall was cool and hard, unlike the live feel the pillar had. Cool\nuntil--\n\nOne palm, held at arm's length had found the right spot. He slid the\nother hand along in the opposite direction until his arms were level\nwith his shoulders. His fingers were able now to press on those points\nof warmth. Travis tensed and pushed hard with all ten fingers.\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\nAt first, as one second and then two passed and there was no response to\nthe pressure, Travis thought he had mistaken the reading of the tape.\nThen, directly before his eyes, a dark line cut vertically down the\nwall. He applied more pressure until his fingers were half numb with\neffort. The line widened slowly. Finally he faced a slit some eight feet\nin height, a little more than two in width, and there the opening\nremained.\n\nLight beyond, a cold, gray gleam--like that of a cloudy winter day on\nTerra--and with it the chill of air out of some arctic wasteland.\nFavoring his still bandaged side, Travis scraped through the door ahead\nof the others, and came into the place of gray cold.\n\n\"Wauggh!\" Travis heard that exclamation from Jil-Lee, could have echoed\nit himself except that he was too astounded by what he had seen to say\nanything at all.\n\nThe light came from a grid of bars set far above their heads into the\nnative rock which roofed this storehouse, for storehouse it was. There\nwere orderly lines of boxes, some large enough to contain a tank, others\nno bigger than a man's fist. Symbols in the same blue-green-purple\nlights of the outer wall shone from their sides.\n\n\"What--?\" Buck began one question and then changed it to another: \"Where\ndo we begin to look?\"\n\n\"Toward the far end.\" Travis started down the center aisle between rows\nof the massed spoils of another time and world--or worlds. The same tape\nwhich had given him the clue to the unlocking of the door, emphasized\nthe importance of something stored at the far end, an object or objects\nwhich must be used first. He had wondered about that tape. A sensation\nof urgency, almost of despair, had come through the gabble of alien\nwords, the quick sequence of diagrams and pictures. The message might\nhave been taped under a threat of some great peril.\n\nThere was no dust on the rows of boxes or on the floor underfoot. A\ncurrent of cold, fresh air blew at intervals down the length of the huge\nchamber. They could not see the next aisle across the barriers of stored\ngoods, but the only noise was a whisper and the faint sounds of their\nown feet. They came out into an open space backed by the wall, and\nTravis saw what had been so important.\n\n\"No!\" His protest was involuntary, but his denial loud enough to echo.\n\nSix--six of them--tall, narrow cases set upright against the wall; and\nfrom their depths, five pairs of dark eyes staring back at him in cold\nmeasurement. These were the men of the ships--the men Menlik had dreamed\nof--their bald white heads, their thin bodies with the skintight\ncovering of the familiar blue-green-purple. Five of them were here,\nalive--watching ... waiting....\n\nFive men--and six boxes. That small fact broke the spell in which those\neyes held Travis. He looked again at the sixth box to his right.\nExpecting to meet another pair of eyes this time, he was disconcerted to\nface only emptiness. Then, as his gaze traveled downward, he saw what\nlay on the floor there--a skull, a tangle of bones, tattered material\ncobwebbed into dusty rags by time. Whatever had preserved five of the\nstar men intact, had failed the sixth of their company.\n\n\"They are alive!\" Jil-Lee whispered.\n\n\"I do not think so,\" Buck answered. Travis took another step, reached\nout to touch the transparent front of the nearest coffin case. There was\nno change in the eyes of the alien who stood within, no indication that\nif the Apaches could see him, he would be able to return their interest.\nThe five stares which had bemused the visitors at first, did not break\nto follow their movements.\n\nBut Travis knew! Whether it was some message on the tape which the sight\nof the sleepers made clear, or whether some residue of the driving\npurpose which had set them there now reached his mind, was immaterial.\nHe knew the purpose of this room and its contents, why it had been made\nand the reason its six guardians had been left as prisoners--and what\nthey wanted from anyone coming after them.\n\n\"They sleep,\" he said softly.\n\n\"Sleep?\" Buck caught him up.\n\n\"They sleep in something like deep freeze.\"\n\n\"Do you mean they can be brought to life again!\" Jil-Lee cried.\n\n\"Maybe not now--it must be too long--but they were meant to wait out a\nperiod and be restored.\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\" Buck asked.\n\n\"I don't know for certain, but I think I understand a little. Something\nhappened a long time ago. Maybe it was a war, a war between whole star\nsystems, bigger and worse than anything we can imagine. I think this\nplanet was an outpost, and when the supply ships didn't come any more,\nwhen they knew they might be cut off for some length of time, they\nclosed down. Stacked their supplies and machines here and then went to\nsleep to wait for their rescuers....\"\n\n\"For rescuers who never came,\" Jil-Lee said softly. \"And there is a\nchance they could be revived even now?\"\n\nTravis shivered. \"Not one I would want to take.\"\n\n\"No,\" Buck's tone was somber, \"that I agree to, younger brother. These\nare not men as we know them, and I do not think they would be good\n_dalaanbiyat'i_--allies. They had _go'ndi_ in plenty, these star men,\nbut it is not the power of the People. No one but a madman or a fool\nwould try to disturb this sleep of theirs.\"\n\n\"The truth you speak,\" Jil-Lee agreed. \"But where in this,\" he turned\nhis shoulder to the sleeping star men and looked back at the filled\nchamber--\"do we find anything which will serve us here and now?\"\n\nAgain Travis had only the scrappiest information to draw upon. \"Spread\nout,\" he told them. \"Look for the marking of a circle surrounding four\ndots set in a diamond pattern.\"\n\nThey went, but Travis lingered for a moment to look once more into the\nbleak and bitter eyes of the star men. How many planet years ago had\nthey sealed themselves into those boxes? A thousand, ten thousand? Their\nempire was long gone, yet here was an outpost still waiting to be\nrevived to carry on its mysterious duties. It was as if in Saxon-invaded\nBritain long ago a Roman garrison had been frozen to await the return of\nthe legions. Buck was right; there was no common ground today between\nTerran man and these unknowns. They must continue to sleep undisturbed.\n\nYet when Travis also turned away and went back down the aisle, he was\nstill aware of a persistent pull on him to return. It was as though\nthose eyes had set locking cords to will him back to release the\nsleepers. He was glad to turn a corner, to know that they could no\nlonger watch him plunder their treasury.\n\n\"Here!\" That was Buck's voice, but it echoed so oddly across the big\nchamber that Travis had difficulty in deciding what part of the\nwarehouse it was coming from. And Buck had to call several times before\nTravis and Jil-Lee joined him.\n\nThere was the circle-dot-diamond symbol shining on the side of a case.\nThey worked it out of the pile, setting it in the open. Travis knelt to\nrun his hands along the top. The container was an unknown alloy, tough,\nunmarked by the years--perhaps indestructible.\n\nAgain his fingers located what his eyes could not detect--the\nimpressions on the edge, oddly shaped impressions into which his finger\ntips did not fit too comfortably. He pressed, bearing down with the full\nstrength of his arms and shoulders, and then lifted up the lid.\n\nThe Apaches looked into a set of compartments, each holding an object\nwith a barrel, a hand grip, a general resemblance to the sidearms of\ntheir own world and time, but sufficiently different to point up the\nessential strangeness. With infinite care Travis worked one out of the\nvise-support which held it. The weapon was light in weight, lighter than\nany automatic he had ever held. Its barrel was long, a good eighteen\ninches--the grip alien in shape so that it didn't fit comfortably into\nhis hand, the trigger nonexistent, but in its place a button on the\nlower part of the barrel which could be covered by an outstretched\nfinger.\n\n\"What does it do?\" asked Buck practically.\n\n\"I'm not sure. But it is important enough to have a special mention on\nthe tape.\" Travis passed the weapon along to Buck and worked another\nloose from its holder.\n\n\"No way of loading I can see,\" Buck said, examining the weapon with care\nand caution.\n\n\"I don't think it fires a solid projectile,\" Travis replied. \"We'll have\nto test them outside to find out just what we do have.\"\n\nThe Apaches took only three of the weapons, closing the box before they\nleft. And as they wriggled back through the crack door, Travis was\nvisited again by that odd flash of compelling, almost possessive power\nhe had experienced when they had lain in ambush for the Red hunting\nparty. He took a step or two forward until he was able to catch the edge\nof the reading table and steady himself against it.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" Both Buck and Jil-Lee were watching him;\napparently neither had felt that sensation. Travis did not reply for a\nsecond. He was free of it now. But he was sure of its source; it had not\nbeen any backlash of the Red caller! It was rooted here--a compulsion\ntriggered to make the original intentions of the outpost obeyed, a last\ndrag from the sleepers. This place had been set up with a single\npurpose: to protect and preserve the ancient rulers of Topaz. And\nperhaps the very presence here of the intruding Terrans had released a\nforce, started an unseen installation.\n\nNow Travis answered simply: \"They want out....\"\n\nJil-Lee glanced back at the slit door, but Buck still watched Travis.\n\n\"They call?\" he asked.\n\n\"In a way,\" Travis admitted. But the compulsion had already ebbed; he\nwas free. \"It is gone now.\"\n\n\"This is not a good place,\" Buck observed somberly. \"We touch that which\nshould not be held by men of our earth.\" He held out the weapon.\n\n\"Did not the People take up the rifles of the Pinda-lick-o-yi for their\ndefense when it was necessary?\" Jil-Lee demanded. \"We do what we must.\nAfter seeing that,\" his chin indicated the slit and what lay behind\nit--\"do you wish the Reds to forage here?\"\n\n\"Still,\" Buck's words came slowly, \"this is a choice between two evils,\nrather than between an evil and a good--\"\n\n\"Then let us see how powerful this evil is!\" Jil-Lee headed for the\ncorridor leading to the pillar.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was late afternoon when they made their way through the swirling\nmists of the valley under the archway giving on the former site of the\noutlaw Tatar camp. Travis sighted the long barrel of the weapon at a\nsmall bush backed by a boulder, and he pressed the firing button. There\nwas no way of knowing whether the weapon was loaded except to try it.\n\nThe result of his action was quick--quick and terrifying. There was no\nsound, no sign of any projectile ... ray-gas ... or whatever might have\nissued in answer to his finger movement. But the bush--the bush was no\nmore!\n\nA black smear made a ragged outline of the extinguished branches and\nleaves on the rock which had stood behind. The earth might still enclose\nroots under a thin coating of ash, but the bush was gone!\n\n\"The breath of Naye'nezyani--powerful beyond belief!\" Buck broke their\nhorrified silence first. \"In truth evil is here!\"\n\nJil-Lee raised his gun--if gun it could be called--aimed at the rock\nwith the bush silhouette plain to see and fired.\n\nThis time they were able to witness disintegration in progress, the\ncrumble of the stone as if its substance was no more than sand lapped by\nriver water. A pile of blackened rubble remained--nothing more.\n\n\"To use this on a living thing?\" Buck protested, horror basing the doubt\nin his voice.\n\n\"We do not use it against living things,\" Travis promised, \"but against\nthe ship of the Reds--to cut that to pieces. This will open the shell of\nthe turtle and let us at its meat.\"\n\nJil-Lee nodded. \"Those are true words. But now I agree with your fears\nof this place, Travis. This is a devil thing and must not be allowed to\nfall into the hands of those who--\"\n\n\"Will use it more freely than we plan to?\" Buck wanted to know. \"We\nreserve to ourselves that right because we hold our motives higher? To\nthink that way is also a crooked trail. We will use this means because\nwe must, but afterward....\"\n\nAfterward that warehouse must be closed, the tapes giving the entrance\nclue destroyed. One part of Travis fought that decision, right though he\nknew it to be. The towers were the menace he had believed. And what was\nmore discouraging than the risk they now ran, was the belief that the\ntreasure was a poison which could not be destroyed but which might\nspread from Topaz to Terra.\n\nSuppose the Western Conference had discovered that storehouse and\nexplored its riches, would they have been any less eager to exploit\nthem? As Buck had pointed out, one's own ideals could well supply\nreasons for violence. In the past Terra had been racked by wars of\nreligion, one fanatically held opinion opposed to another. There was no\nrighteousness in such struggles, only fatal ends. The Reds had no right\nto this new knowledge--but neither did they. It must be locked against\nthe meddling of fools and zealots.\n\n\"Taboo--\" Buck spoke that word with an emphasis they could appreciate.\nKnowledge must be set behind the invisible barriers of taboo, and that\ncould work.\n\n\"These three--no more--we found no other weapons!\" Jil-Lee added a\nwarning suggestion.\n\n\"No others,\" Buck agreed and Travis echoed, adding:\n\n\"We found tombs of the space people, and these were left with them.\nBecause of our great need we borrowed them, but they must be returned to\nthe dead or trouble will follow. And they may only be used against the\nfortress of the Reds by us, who first found them and have taken unto\nourselves the wrath of disturbed spirits.\"\n\n\"Well thought! That is an answer to give the People. The towers are the\ntombs of dead ones. When we return these they shall be taboo. We are\nagreed?\" Buck asked.\n\n\"We are agreed!\"\n\nBuck tried his weapon on a sapling, saw it vanish into nothingness. None\nof the Apaches wanted to carry the strange guns against their bodies;\nthe power made them objects of fear, rather than arms to delight a\nwarrior. And when they returned to their temporary camp, they laid all\nthree on a blanket and covered them up. But they could not cover up the\nmemories of what had happened to bush, rock, and tree.\n\n\"If such are their small weapons,\" Buck observed that evening, \"then\nwhat kind of things did they have to balance our heavy armament? Perhaps\nthey were able to burn up worlds!\"\n\n\"That may be what happened elsewhere,\" Travis replied. \"We do not know\nwhat put an end to their empire. The capital-planet we found on the\nfirst voyage had not been destroyed, but it had been evacuated in haste.\nOne building had not even been stripped of its furnishings.\" He\nremembered the battle he had fought there, he and Ross Murdock and the\nwinged native, standing up to an attack of the ape-things while the\nwinged warrior had used his physical advantage to fly above and bomb the\nenemies with boxes snatched from the piles....\n\n\"And here they went to sleep in order to wait out some danger--time or\ndisaster--they did not believe would be permanent,\" Buck mused.\n\nTravis thought he would flee from the eyes of the sleepers throughout\nhis dreams that night, but on the contrary he slept heavily, finding it\nhard to rouse when Jil-Lee awakened him for his watch. But he was alert\nwhen he saw a four-footed shape flit out of the shadows, drink water\nfrom the stream, and shake itself vigorously in a spray of drops.\n\n\"Naginlta!\" he greeted the coyote. Trouble? He could have shouted that\nquestion, but he put a tight rein on his impatience and strove to\ncommunicate in the only method possible.\n\nNo, what the coyote had come to report was not trouble but the fact that\nthe one he had been set to guard was headed back into the mountains,\nthough others came with her--four others. Nalik'ideyu still watched\ntheir camp. Her mate had come for further orders.\n\nTravis squatted before the animal, cupped the coyote's jowls between his\npalms. Naginlta suffered his touch with only a small whine of\nuneasiness. With all his power of mental suggestion, Travis strove to\nreach the keen brain he knew was served by the yellow eyes looking into\nhis.\n\nThe others with Kaydessa were to be led on, taken to the ship. But\nKaydessa must not suffer harm. When they reached a spot near-by--Travis\nthought of a certain rock beyond the pass--then one of the coyotes was\nto go ahead to the ship. Let the Apaches there know....\n\nManulito and Eskelta should also be warned by the sentry along the\npeaks, but additional alerting would not go amiss. Those four with\nKaydessa--they must reach the trap!\n\n\"What was that?\" Buck rolled out of his blanket.\n\n\"Naginlta--\" The coyote sped back into the dark again. \"The Reds have\ntaken the bait, a party of at least four with Kaydessa are moving into\nthe foothills, heading south.\"\n\nBut the enemy party was not the only one on the move. In the light of\nday a sentry's mirror from a point in the peaks sent another warning\ndown to their camp.\n\nOut in their mountain meadows the Tatar outlaws were on horseback,\nmoving toward the entrance of the tower valley. Buck knelt by the\nblanket covering the alien weapons.\n\n\"Now what?\"\n\n\"We'll have to stop them,\" Travis replied, but he had no idea of just\nhow they would halt those determined Mongol horsemen.\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\nThere were ten of them riding on small, wiry steppe ponies--men and\nwomen both, and well armed. Travis recalled it was the custom of the\nHorde that the women fought as warriors when necessary. Menlik--there\nwas no mistaking the flapping robe of their leader. And they were\nsinging! The rider behind the shaman thumped with violent energy a drum\nfastened beside his saddle horn, its heavy boom, boom the same call the\nApache had heard before. The Mongols were working themselves into the\nmood for some desperate effort, Travis deduced. And if they were too\ndeeply under the Red spell, there would be no arguing with them. He\ncould wait no longer.\n\nThe Apache swung down from a ledge near the valley gate, moved into the\nopen and stood waiting, the alien weapon resting across his forearm. If\nnecessary, he intended to give a demonstration with it for an object\nlesson.\n\n\"_Dar-u-gar_!\" The war cry which had once awakened fear across a quarter\nof Terra. Thin here, and from only a few throats, but just as menacing.\n\nTwo of the horsemen aimed lances, preparing to ride him down. Travis\nsighted a tree midway between them and pressed the firing button. This\ntime there was a flash, a flicker of light, to mark the disappearance of\na living thing.\n\nOne of the lancers' ponies reared, squealed in fear. The other kept on\nhis course.\n\n\"Menlik!\" Travis shouted. \"Hold up your man! I do not want to kill!\"\n\nThe shaman called out, but the lancer was already level with the\nvanished tree, his head half turned on his shoulders to witness the\nblackened earth where it had stood. Then he dropped his lance, sawed on\nthe reins. A rifle bullet might not have halted his charge, unless it\nkilled or wounded, but what he had just seen was a thing beyond his\nunderstanding.\n\nThe tribesmen sat their horses, facing Travis, watching him with the\nferal eyes of the wolves they claimed as forefathers, wolves that\npossessed the cunning of the wild, cunning enough not to rush breakneck\ninto unknown danger.\n\nTravis walked forward. \"Menlik, I would talk--\"\n\nThere was an outburst from the horsemen, protests from Hulagur and one\nor two of the others. But the shaman urged his mount into a walking pace\ntoward the Apache until they stood only a few feet from each other--the\nwarrior of the steppes and the Horde facing the warrior of the desert\nand the People.\n\n\"You have taken a woman from our yurts,\" Menlik said, but his eyes were\nmore on the alien gun than on the man who held it. \"Brave are you to\ncome again into our land. He who sets foot in the stirrup must mount\ninto the saddle; he who draws blade free of the scabbard must be\nprepared to use it.\"\n\n\"The Horde is not here--I see only a handful of people,\" Travis replied.\n\"Does Menlik propose to go up against the Apaches so? Yet there are\nthose who are his greater enemies.\"\n\n\"A stealer of women is not such a one as needs a regiment under a\ngeneral to face him.\"\n\nSuddenly Travis was impatient of the ceremonious talking; there was so\nlittle time.\n\n\"Listen, and listen well, Shaman!\" He spoke curtly now. \"I have not your\nwoman. She is already crossing the mountains southward,\" he pointed with\nhis chin--\"leading the Reds into a trap.\"\n\nWould Menlik believe him? There was no need, Travis decided, to tell him\nnow that Kaydessa's part in this affair was involuntary.\n\n\"And you?\" The shaman asked the question the Apache had hoped to hear.\n\n\"_We_,\" Travis emphasized that, \"march now against those hiding behind\nin their ship out there.\" He indicated the northern plains.\n\nMenlik raised his head, surveying the land about them with disbelieving,\ncontemptuous appraisal.\n\n\"You are chief then of an army, an army equipped with magic to overcome\nmachines?\"\n\n\"One needs no army when he carries this.\" For the second time Travis\ndisplayed the power of the weapon he carried, this time cutting into\nshifting rubble an outcrop of cliff wall. Menlik's expression did not\nchange, though his eyes narrowed.\n\nThe shaman signaled his small company, and they dismounted. Travis was\nheartened by this sign that Menlik was willing to talk. The Apache made\na similar gesture, and Jil-Lee and Buck, their own weapons well in\nsight, came out to back him. Travis knew that the Tatar had no way of\nknowing that the three were alone; he well might have believed an unseen\ntroop of Apaches were near-by and so armed.\n\n\"You would talk--then talk!\" Menlik ordered.\n\nThis time Travis outlined events with an absence of word embroidery.\n\"Kaydessa leads the Reds into a trap we have set beyond the peaks--four\nof them ride with her. How many now remain in the ship near the\nsettlement?\"\n\n\"There are at least two in the flyer, perhaps eight more in the ship.\nBut there is no getting at them in there.\"\n\n\"No?\" Travis laughed softly, shifted the weapon on his arm. \"Do you not\nthink that this will crack the shell of that nut so that we can get at\nthe meat?\"\n\nMenlik's eyes flickered to the left, to the tree which was no longer a\ntree but a thin deposit of ash on seared ground.\n\n\"They can control us with the caller as they did before. If we go up\nagainst them, then we are once more gathered into their net--before we\nreach their ship.\"\n\n\"That is true for you of the Horde; it does not affect the People,\"\nTravis returned. \"And suppose we burn out their machines? Then will you\nnot be free?\"\n\n\"To burn up a tree? Lightning from the skies can do that.\"\n\n\"Can lightning,\" Buck asked softly, \"also make rock as sand of the\nriver?\"\n\nMenlik's eyes turned to the second example of the alien weapon's power.\n\n\"Give us proof that this will act against their machines!\"\n\n\"What proof, Shaman?\" asked Jil-Lee. \"Shall we burn down a mountain that\nyou may believe? This is now a matter of time.\"\n\nTravis had a sudden inspiration. \"You say that the 'copter is out.\nSuppose we use that as a target?\"\n\n\"That--that can sweep the flyer from the sky?\" Menlik's disbelief was\nopen.\n\nTravis wondered if he had gone too far. But they needed to rid\nthemselves of that spying flyer before they dared to move out into the\nplain. And to use the destruction of the helicopter as an example, would\nbe the best proof he could give of the invincibility of the new Apache\narms.\n\n\"Under the right conditions,\" he replied stoutly, \"yes.\"\n\n\"And those conditions?\" Menlik demanded.\n\n\"That it must be brought within range. Say, below the level of a\nneighboring peak where a man may lie in wait to fire.\"\n\nSilent Apaches faced silent Mongols, and Travis had a chance to taste\nwhat might be defeat. But the helicopter must be taken before they\nadvanced toward the ship and the settlement.\n\n\"And, maker of traps, how do you intend to bait this one?\" Menlik's\nquestion was an open challenge.\n\n\"You know these Reds better than we,\" Travis counterattacked. \"How would\nyou bait it, Son of the Blue Wolf?\"\n\n\"You say Kaydessa is leading the Reds south; we have but your word for\nthat,\" Menlik replied. \"Though how it would profit you to lie on such a\nmatter--\" He shrugged. \"If you do speak the truth, then the 'copter will\ncircle about the foothills where they entered.\"\n\n\"And what would bring the pilot nosing farther in?\" the Apache asked.\n\nMenlik shrugged again. \"Any manner of things. The Reds have never\nventured too far south; they are suspicious of the heights--with good\ncause.\" His fingers, near the hilt of his tulwar, twitched. \"Anything\nwhich might suggest that their party is in difficulty would bring them\nin for a closer look--\"\n\n\"Say a fire, with much smoke?\" Jil-Lee suggested.\n\nMenlik spoke over his shoulder to his own party. There was a babble of\nanswer, two or three of the men raising their voices above those of\ntheir companions.\n\n\"If set in the right direction, yes,\" the shaman conceded. \"When do you\nplan to move, Apaches?\"\n\n\"At once!\"\n\nBut they did not have wings, and the cross-country march they had to\nmake was a rough journey on foot. Travis' \"at once\" stretched into night\nhours filled with scrambling over rocks, and an early morning of\npreparations, with always the threat that the helicopter might not\nreturn to fly its circling mission over the scene of operations. All\nthey had was Menlik's assurance that while any party of the Red\noverlords was away from their well-defended base, the flyer did just\nthat.\n\n\"Might be relaying messages on from a walkie-talkie or something like\nthat,\" Buck commented.\n\n\"They should reach our ship in two days ... three at the most ... if\nthey are pushing,\" Travis said thoughtfully. \"It would be a help--if\nthat flyer is a link in any com unit--to destroy it before its crew\npicks up and relays any report of what happens back there.\"\n\nJil-Lee grunted. He was surveying the heights above the pocket in which\nMenlik and two of the Mongols were piling brush. \"There ... there ...\nand there....\" The Apache's chin made three juts. \"If the pilot swoops\nfor a quick look, our cross fire will take out his blades.\"\n\nThey held a last conference with Menlik and then climbed to the perches\nJil-Lee had selected. Sentries on lookout reported by mirror flash that\nTsoay, Deklay, Lupe, and Nolan were now on the move to join the other\nthree Apaches. If and when Manulito's trap closed its jaws on the Reds\nat the western ship, the news would pass and the Apaches would move out\nto storm the enemy fort on the prairie. And should they blast any caller\nthe helicopter might carry, Menlik and his riders would accompany them.\n\nThere it was, just as Menlik had foretold: The wasp from the open\ncountry was flying into the hills. Menlik, on his knees, struck flint to\nsteel, sparking the fire they hoped would draw the pilot to a closer\ninvestigation.\n\nThe brush caught, and smoke, thick and white, came first in separate\npuffs and then gathered into a murky pillar to form a signal no one\ncould overlook. In Travis' hands the grip of the gun was slippery. He\nrested the end of the barrel on the rock, curbing his rising tension as\nbest he could.\n\nTo escape any caller on the flyer, the Tatars had remained in the valley\nbelow the Apaches' lookout. And as the helicopter circled in, Travis\nsighted two men in its cockpit, one wearing a helmet identical to the\none they had seen on the Red hunter days ago. The Reds' long undisputed\nsway over the Mongol forces would make them overconfident. Travis\nthought that even if they sighted one of the waiting Apaches, they would\nnot take warning until too late.\n\nMenlik's bush fire was performing well and the flyer was heading\nstraight for it. The machine buzzed the smoke once, too high for the\nApaches to trust raying its blades. Then the pilot came back in a lower\nsweep which carried him only yards above the smoldering brush, on a\nlevel with the snipers.\n\nTravis pressed the button on the barrel, his target the fast-whirling\nblades. Momentum carried the helicopter on, but at least one of the\nmarksmen, if not all three, had scored. The machine plowed through the\nsmoke to crack up beyond.\n\nWas their caller working, bringing in the Mongols to aid the Reds\ntrapped in the wreck?\n\nTravis watched Menlik make his way toward the machine, reach the cracked\ncover of the cockpit. But in the shaman's hand was a bare blade on which\nthe sun glinted. The Mongol wrenched open the sprung door, thrust inward\nwith the tulwar, and the howl of triumph he voiced was as worldless and\nwild as a wolf's.\n\nMore Mongols flooding down ... Hulagur ... a woman ... centering on the\nhelicopter. This time a spear plunged into the interior of the broken\nflyer. Payment was being extracted for long slavery.\n\nThe Apaches dropped from the heights, waiting for Menlik to leave the\nwild scene. Hulagur had dragged out the body of the helmeted man and\nthe Mongols were stripping off his equipment, smashing it with rocks,\nstill howling their war cry. But the shaman came to the dying smudge\nfire to meet the Apaches.\n\nHe was smiling, his upper lip raised in a curve suggesting the victory\npurr of a snow tiger. And he saluted with one hand.\n\n\"There are two who will not trap men again! We believe you now, _andas_,\ncomrades of battle, when you say you can go up against their fort and\nmake it as nothing!\"\n\nHulagur came up behind the shaman, a modern automatic in his hand. He\ntossed the weapon into the air, caught it again, laughing--disclaiming\nsomething in his own language.\n\n\"From the serpents we take two fangs,\" Menlik translated. \"These weapons\nmay not be as dangerous as yours, but they can bite deeper, quicker, and\nwith more force than our arrows.\"\n\nIt did not take the Mongols long to strip the helicopter and the Reds of\nwhat they could use, deliberately smashing all the other equipment which\nhad survived the wreck. They had accomplished one important move: The\nlink between the southbound exploring party and the Red headquarters--if\nthat was the role the helicopter had played--was now gone. And the\n\"eyes\" operating over the open territory of the plains had ceased to\nexist. The attacking war party could move against the ship near the Red\nsettlement, knowing they had only controlled Mongol scouts to watch for.\nAnd to penetrate enemy territory under those conditions was an old, old\ngame the Apaches had played for centuries.\n\nWhile they waited for the signals from the peaks, a camp was established\nand a Mongol dispatched to bring up the rest of the outlaws and all\nextra mounts. Menlik carried to the Apaches a portion of the dried meat\nwhich had been transported Horde fashion--under the saddle to soften it\nfor eating.\n\n\"We do not skulk any longer like rats or city men in dark holes,\" he\ntold them. \"This time we ride, and we shall take an accounting from\nthose out there--a fine accounting!\"\n\n\"They still have other controllers,\" Travis pointed out.\n\n\"And you have that which is an answer to all their machines,\" blazed\nMenlik in return.\n\n\"They will send against us your own people if they can,\" Buck warned.\n\nMenlik pulled at his upper lip. \"That is also truth. But now they have\nno eyes in the sky, and with so many of their men away, they will not\npatrol too far from camp. I tell you, _andas_, with these weapons of\nyours a man could rule a world!\"\n\nTravis looked at him bleakly. \"Which is why they are taboo!\"\n\n\"Taboo?\" Menlik repeated. \"In what manner are these forbidden? Do you\nnot carry them openly, use them as you wish? Are they not weapons of\nyour own people?\"\n\nTravis shook his head. \"These are the weapons of dead men--if we can\nname them men at all. These we took from a tomb of the star race who\nheld Topaz when our world was only a hunting ground of wild men wearing\nthe skins of beasts and slaying mammoths with stone spears. They are\nfrom a tomb and are cursed, a curse we took upon ourselves with their\nuse.\"\n\nThere was a strange light deep in the shaman's eyes. Travis did not know\nwho or what Menlik had been before the Red conditioner had returned him\nto the role of Horde shaman. He might have been a technician or\nscientist--and deep within him some remnants of that training could now\nbe dismissing everything Travis said as fantastic superstition.\n\nYet in another way the Apache spoke the exact truth. There was a curse\non these weapons, on every bit of knowledge gathered in that warehouse\nof the towers. As Menlik had already noted, that curse was power, the\npower to control Topaz, and then perhaps to reach back across the stars\nto Terra.\n\nWhen the shaman spoke again his words were a half whisper. \"It will take\na powerful curse to keep these out of the hands of men.\"\n\n\"With the Reds gone or powerless,\" Buck asked, \"what need will anyone\nhave for them?\"\n\n\"And if another ship comes from the skies--to begin all over again?\"\n\n\"To that we shall have an answer, also, if and when we must find it,\"\nTravis replied. That could well be true ... other weapons in the\nwarehouse powerful enough to pluck a spaceship out of the sky, but they\ndid not have to worry about that now.\n\n\"Arms from a tomb. Yes, this is truly dead men's magic. I shall say so\nto my people. When do we move out?\"\n\n\"When we know whether or not the trap to the south is sprung,\" Buck\nanswered.\n\nThe report came an hour after sunrise the next morning when Tsoay,\nNolan, and Deklay padded into camp. The war chief made a slight gesture\nwith one hand.\n\n\"It is done?\" Travis wanted confirmation in words.\n\n\"It is done. The Pinda-lick-o-yi entered the ship eagerly. Then they\nblew it and themselves up. Manulito did his work well.\"\n\n\"And Kaydessa?\"\n\n\"The woman is safe. When the Reds saw the ship, they left their machine\noutside to hold her captive. That mechanical caller was easily\ndestroyed. She is now free and with the _mba'a_ she comes across the\nmountains, Manulito and Eskelta with her also. Now--\" he looked from his\nown people to the Mongols, \"why are you here with these?\"\n\n\"We wait, but the waiting is over,\" Jil-Lee said. \"Now we go north!\"\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\nThey lay along the rim of a vast basin, a scooping out of earth so wide\nthey could not sight its other side. The bed of an ancient lake, Travis\nspeculated, or perhaps even the arm of a long-dried sea. But now the\nhollow was filled with rolling waves of golden grass, tossing heavy\nheads under the flowing touch of a breeze with the exception of a space\nabout a mile ahead where round domes--black, gray, brown--broke the\nyellow in an irregular oval around the globular silver bead of a spacer:\na larger ship than that which had brought the Apaches, but of the same\nshape.\n\n\"The horse herd ... to the west.\" Nolan evaluated the scene with the\neyes of an experienced raider. \"Tsoay, Deklay, you take the horses!\"\n\nThey nodded, and began the long crawl which would take them two miles or\nmore from the party to stampede the horses.\n\nTo the Mongols in those domelike yurts horses were wealth, life itself.\nThey would come running to investigate any disturbance among the grazing\nponies, thus clearing the path to the ship and the Reds there. Travis,\nJil-Lee, and Buck, armed with the star guns, would spearhead that\nattack--cutting into the substance of the ship itself until it was a\nsieve through which they could shake out the enemy. Only when the\ninstallations it contained were destroyed, might the Apaches hope for\nany assistance from the Mongols, either the outlaw pack waiting well\nback on the prairie or the people in the yurts.\n\nThe grass rippled and Naginlta poked out a nose, parting stems before\nTravis. The Apache beamed an order, sending the coyotes with the\nhorse-raiding party. He had seen how the animals could drive hunted\nsplit-horns; they would do as well with the ponies.\n\nKaydessa was safe, the coyotes had made that clear by the fact that they\nhad joined the attacking party an hour earlier. With Eskelta and\nManulito she was on her way back to the north.\n\nTravis supposed he should be well pleased that their reckless plan had\nsucceeded as well as it had. But when he thought of the Tatar girl, all\nhe could see was her convulsed face close to his in the ship corridor,\nher raking nails raised to tear his cheek. She had an excellent reason\nto hate him, yet he hoped....\n\nThey continued to watch both horse herd and domes. There were people\nmoving about the yurts, but no signs of life at the ship. Had the Reds\nshut themselves in there, warned in some way of the two disasters which\nhad whittled down their forces?\n\n\"Ah--!\" Nolan breathed.\n\nOne of the ponies had raised its head and was facing the direction of\nthe camp, suspicion plain to read in its stance. The Apaches must have\nreached the point between the herd and the domes which had been their\ngoal. And the Mongol guard, who had been sitting cross-legged, the\nreins of his mount dangling close to his hand, got to his feet.\n\n\"Ahhhuuuuu!\" The ancient Apache war cry that had sounded across deserts,\ncanyons, and southwestern Terran plains to ice the blood, ripped just as\nfreezingly through the honey-hued air of Topaz.\n\nThe horses wheeled, racing upslope away from the settlement. A figure\nbroke from the grass, flapped his arms at one of the mounts, grabbed at\nflying mane, and pulled himself up on the bare back. Only a master\nhorseman would have done that, but the whooping rider now drove the herd\non, assisted by the snapping and snarling coyotes.\n\n\"Deklay--\" Jil-Lee identified the reckless rider, \"that was one of his\nrodeo tricks.\"\n\nAmong the yurts it was as if someone had ripped up a rotten log to\nreveal an ants' nest and sent the alarmed insects into a frenzy. Men\nboiled out of the domes, the majority of them running for the horse\npasture. One or two were mounted on ponies that must have been staked\nout in the settlement. The main war party of Apaches skimmed silently\nthrough the grass on their way to the ship.\n\nThe three who were armed with the alien weapons had already tested their\nrange by experimentation back in the hills, but the fear of exhausting\nwhatever powered those barrels had curtailed their target practice. Now\nthey snaked to the edge of the bare ground between them and the ladder\nhatch of the spacer. To cross that open space was to provide targets for\nlances and arrows--or the superior armament of the Reds.\n\n\"A chance we can hit from here.\" Buck laid his weapon across his bent\nknee, steadied the long barrel of the burner, and pressed the firing\nbutton.\n\nThe closed hatch of the ship shimmered, dissolved into a black hole.\nBehind Travis someone let out the yammer of a war whoop.\n\n\"Fire--cut the walls to pieces!\"\n\nTravis did not need that order from Jil-Lee. He was already beaming\nunseen destruction at the best target he could ask for--the side of the\nsphere. If the globe was armed, there was no weapon which could be\ndepressed far enough to reach the marksmen at ground level.\n\nHoles appeared, irregular gaps and tears in the fabric of the ship. The\nApaches were turning the side of the globe into lacework. How far those\nrays penetrated into the interior they could not guess.\n\nMovement at one of the holes, the chattering burst of machine-gun fire,\nspatters of soil and gravel into their faces; they could be cut to\npieces by that! The hole enlarged, a scream ... cut off....\n\n\"They will not be too quick to try that again,\" Nolan observed with cold\ncalm from behind Travis' post.\n\nMethodically they continued to beam the ship. It would never be\nspace-borne again; there were neither the skills nor materials here to\nrepair such damage.\n\n\"It is like laying a knife to fat,\" Lupe said as he crawled up beside\nTravis. \"Slice, slice--!\"\n\n\"Move!\" Travis reached to the left, pulled at Jil-Lee's shoulder.\n\nTravis did not know whether it was possible or not, but he had a heady\nvision of their combined fire power cutting the globe in half, slicing\nit crosswise with the ease Lupe admired.\n\nThey scurried through cover just as someone behind yelled a warning.\nTravis threw himself down, rolled into a new firing position. An arrow\nsang over his head; the Reds were doing what the Apaches had known they\nwould--calling in the controlled Mongols to fight. The attack on the\nship must be stepped up, or the Amerindians would be forced to retreat.\n\nAlready a new lacing of holes appeared under their concentrated efforts.\nWith the gun held tight to his middle, Travis found his feet, zigzagged\nacross the bare ground for the nearest of those openings. Another arrow\nclanged harmlessly against the fabric of the ship a foot from his goal.\n\nHe made it in, over jagged metal shards which glowed faintly and reeked\nof ozone. The weapons' beams had penetrated well past both the outer\nshell and the wall of insulation webbing. He climbed a second and\nsmaller break into a corridor enough like those of the western ship to\nbe familiar. The Red spacer, based on the general plan of the alien\nderelict ship as his own had been, could not be very different.\n\nTravis tried to subdue his heavy breathing and listen. He heard a\nconfused shouting and the burr of what might be an alarm system. The\nship's brain was the control cabin. Even if the Reds dared not try to\nlift now, that was the core of their communication lines. He started\nalong the corridor, trying to figure out its orientation in relation to\nthat all-important nerve center.\n\nThe Apache shoved open each door he passed with one shoulder, and twice\nhe played a light beam on installations within cabins. He had no idea of\ntheir use, but the wholesale destruction of each and every machine was\nwhat good sense and logic dictated.\n\nThere was a sound behind. Travis whirled, saw Jil-Lee and beyond him\nBuck.\n\n\"Up?\" Jil-Lee asked.\n\n\"And down,\" Buck added. \"The Tatars say they have hollowed a bunker\nbeneath.\"\n\n\"Separate and do as much damage as you can,\" Travis suggested.\n\n\"Agreed!\"\n\nTravis sped on. He passed another door and then backtracked hurriedly as\nhe realized it had given on to an engine room. With the gun he blasted\ntwo long lines cutting the fittings into ragged lumps. Abruptly the\nlights went out; the burr of the alarms was silenced. Part of the ship,\nif not all, was dead. And now it might come to hunter and hunted in the\ndark. But that was an advantage as far as the Apaches were concerned.\n\nBack in the corridor again, Travis crept through a curiously lifeless\natmosphere. The shouting was stilled as if the sudden failure of the\nmachines had stunned the Reds.\n\nA tiny sound--perhaps the scrape of a boot on a ladder. Travis edged\nback into a compartment. A flash of light momentarily lighted the\ncorridor; the approaching figure was using a torch. Travis drew his\nknife with one hand, reversed it so he could use the heavy hilt as a\nsilencer. The other was hurrying now, on his way to investigate the\nburned-out engine cabin. Travis could hear the rasp of his fast\nbreathing. Now!\n\nThe Apache had put down the gun, his left arm closed about a shoulder,\nand the Red gasped as Travis struck with the knife hilt. Not clean--he\nhad to hit a second time before the struggles of the man were over.\nThen, using his hands for eyes, he stripped the limp body on the floor\nof automatic and torch.\n\nWith the Red's weapon in the front of his sash, the burner in one hand\nand the torch in the other, Travis prowled on. There was a good chance\nthat those above might believe him to be their comrade returning. He\nfound the ladder leading to the next level, began to climb, pausing now\nand then to listen.\n\nShock preceded sound. Under him the ladder swayed and the globe itself\nrocked a little. A blast of some kind must have been set off at or under\nthe level of the ground. The bunker Buck had mentioned?\n\nTravis clung to the ladder, waited for the vibrations to subside. There\nwas a shouting above, a questioning.... Hurriedly he ascended to the\nnext level, scrambled out and away from the ladder just in time to avoid\nthe light from another torch flashed down the well. Again that call of\ninquiry, then a shot--the boom of the explosion loud in the confined\nspace.\n\nTo climb into the face of that light with a waiting marksman above was\nsheer folly. Could there be another way up? Travis retreated down one of\nthe corridors raying out from the ladder well. A quick inspection of the\ncabins along that route told him he had reached a section of living\nquarters. The pattern was familiar; the control cabin would be on the\nnext level.\n\nSuddenly the Apache remembered something: On each level there should be\nan emergency opening giving access to the insulation space between the\ninner and outer skins of the ship through which repairs could be made.\nIf he could find that and climb up to the next level....\n\nThe light shining down the well remained steady, and there was the\nechoing crack of another shot. But Travis was far enough away from the\nladder now to dare use his own torch, seeking the door he needed on the\nwall surface. With a leap of heart he sighted the outline--his luck was\nin! The Russian and western ships were alike.\n\nOnce the panel was open he flashed his torch up, finding the climbing\nrungs and, above, the shadow outline of the next level opening. Securing\nthe alien gun in his sash beside the automatic and holding the torch in\nhis mouth, Travis climbed, not daring to think of the deep drop below.\nFour ... five ... ten rungs, and he could reach the other door.\n\nHis fingers slid over it, searching for the release catch. But there was\nno answering give. Balling his fist, he struck down at an awkward angle\nand almost lost his balance as the panel fell away beneath his blow. The\ndoor swung and he pulled through.\n\nDarkness! Travis snapped on the torch for an instant, saw about him the\nrelays of a com system, and gave it a full spraying as he pivoted,\ndestroying the eyes and ears of the ship--unless the burnout he had\neffected below had already done that. A flash of automatic fire from his\nleft, a searing burn along his arm an inch or so below the shoulder--\n\nTravis' action was purely reflex. He swung the burner around, even as\nhis mind gave a frantic No! To defend himself with automatic, knife,\narrow--yes; but not this way. He huddled against the wall.\n\nAn instant earlier there had been a man there, a living, breathing\nman--one of his own species, if not of his own beliefs. Then because his\nown muscles had unconsciously obeyed warrior training, there was this.\nSo easy--to deal death without really meaning to. The weapon in his\nhands was truly the devil gift they were right to fear. Such weapons\nwere not to be put into the hands of men--any men--no matter how well\nintentioned.\n\nTravis gulped in great mouthfuls of air. He wanted to throw the burner\naway, hurl it from him. But the task he could rightfully use it for was\nnot yet done.\n\nSomehow he reeled on into the control cabin to render the ship truly a\ndead thing and free himself of the heavy burden of guilt and terror\nbetween his hands. That weight could be laid aside; memory could not.\nAnd no one of his kind must ever have to carry such memories again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe booming of the drums was like a pulse quickening the blood to a\nrhythm which bit at the brain, made a man's eyes shine, his muscles\ntense as if he held an arrow to bow cord or arched his fingers about a\nknife hilt. A fire blazed high and in its light men leaped and whirled\nin a mad dance with tulwar blades catching and reflecting the red gleam\nof flames. Mad, wild, the Mongols were drunk with victory and freedom.\nBeyond them, the silver globe of the ship showed the black holes of its\ndeath, which was also the death of the past--for all of them.\n\n\"What now?\" Menlik, the dangling of amulets and charms tinkling as he\nmoved, came up to Travis. There was none of the wild fervor in the\nshaman's face; instead, it was as if he had taken several strides out of\nthe life of the Horde, was emerging into another person, and the\nquestion he asked was one they all shared.\n\nTravis felt drained, flattened. They had achieved their purpose. The\nhandful of Red overlords were dead, their machines burned out. There\nwere no controls here any more; men were free in mind and body. What\nwere they to do with that freedom?\n\n\"First,\" the Apache spoke his own thoughts--\"we must return these.\"\n\nThe three alien weapons were lashed into a square of Mongol fabric,\nhidden from sight, although they could not be so easily shut out of\nmind. Only a few of the others, Apache or Mongol, had seen them; and\nthey must be returned before their power was generally known.\n\n\"I wonder if in days to come,\" Buck mused, \"they will not say that we\npulled lightning out of the sky, as did the Thunder Slayer, to aid us.\nBut this is right. We must return them and make that valley and what it\nholds taboo.\"\n\n\"And what if another ship comes--one of _yours_?\" Menlik asked shrewdly.\n\nTravis stared beyond the Tatar shaman to the men about the fire. His\nnightmare dragged into the open.... What if a ship did come in, one with\nAshe, Murdock, men he knew and liked, friends on board? What then of his\nguardianship of the towers and their knowledge? Could he be as sure of\nwhat to do then? He rubbed his hand across his forehead and said slowly:\n\n\"We shall take steps when--or if--that happens--\"\n\nBut could they, would they? He began to hope fiercely that it would not\nhappen, at least in his lifetime, and then felt the cold bleakness of\nthe exile they must will themselves into.\n\n\"Whether we like it or not,\" (was he talking to the others or trying to\nargue down his own rebellion?) \"we cannot let what lies under the towers\nbe known ... found ... used ... unless by men who are wiser and more\ncontrolled than we are in our time.\"\n\nMenlik drew his shaman's wand, twiddled it between his fingers, and\nbeneath his drooping lids watched the three Apaches with a new kind of\nmeasurement.\n\n\"Then I say to you this: Such a guardianship must be a double charge,\nshared by my people as well. For if they suspect that you alone control\nthese powers and their secret, there will be envy, hatred, fear, a\ndivision between us from the first--war ... raids.... This is a large\nland and neither of our groups numbers many. Shall we split apart\nfatally from this day when there is room for all? If these ancient\nthings are evil, then let us both guard them with a common taboo.\"\n\nHe was right, of course. And they would have to face the truth squarely.\nTo both Apache and Mongol any off-world ship, no matter from which side,\nwould be a menace. Here was where they would remain and set roots. The\nsooner they began thinking of themselves as people with a common bond,\nthe better it would be. And Menlik's suggestion provided a tie.\n\n\"You speak well,\" Buck was saying. \"This shall be a thing we share. We\nare three who know. Do you be three also, but choose well, Menlik!\"\n\n\"Be assured that I will!\" the Tatar returned. \"We start a new life here;\nthere is no going back. But as I have said: The land is wide. We have no\nquarrel with one another, and perhaps our two peoples shall become one;\nafter all, we do not differ too greatly....\" He smiled and gestured to\nthe fire and the dancers.\n\nAmong the Mongols another man had gone into action, his head thrown back\nas he leaped and twirled, voicing a deep war cry. Travis recognized\nDeklay. Apache, Mongol--both raiders, horsemen, hunters, fighters when\nthe need arose. No, there was no great difference. Both had been tricked\ninto coming here, and they had no allegiance now for those who had sent\nthem.\n\nPerhaps clan and Horde would combine or perhaps they would drift\napart--time would tell. But there would be the bond of the guardianship,\nthe determination that what slept in the towers would not be roused--in\ntheir lifetime or many lifetimes!\n\nTravis smiled a bit crookedly. A new religion of sorts, a priesthood\nwith sacred and forbidden knowledge ... in time a whole new life and\ncivilization stemming from this night. The bleak cold of his early\nthought cut less deep. There was a different kind of adventure here.\n\nHe reached out and gathered up the bundle of the burners, glancing from\nBuck to Jil-Lee to Menlik. Then he stood up, the weight of the burden in\nhis arms, the feeling of a greater weight inside him.\n\n\"Shall we go?\"\n\nTo get the weapons back--that was of first importance. Maybe then he\ncould sleep soundly, to dream of riding across the Arizona range at dawn\nunder a blue sky with a wind in his face, a wind carrying the scent of\npi\u00f1on pine and sage, a wind which would never caress or hearten him\nagain, a wind his sons and sons' sons would never know. To dream\ntroubled dreams, and hope in time those dreams would fade and thin--that\na new world would blanket out the old. Better so, Travis told himself\nwith defiance and determination--better so!\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Defiant Agents, by Andre Alice Norton\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE DEFIANT AGENTS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 25550-8.txt or 25550-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/5/5/5/25550/\n\nProduced by Elaine Walker, Greg Weeks, Jason Isbell and\nthe Online Distributed Proofreading Team at\nhttp://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
