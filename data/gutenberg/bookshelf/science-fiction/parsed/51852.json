F. BONE\n\n                         Illustrated by RITTER\n\n           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n                      Galaxy Magazine April 1962.\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\n\n\n\n              The creatures were huge, hairy, surly--and\n              the males were always chasing the females.\n              But what else could you expect of mammals?\n\n\nI\n\n\"We need data,\" I said as I manipulated the scanner and surveyed our\nlittle domain of rocks and vegetation. \"The animate life we have\ncollected so far is of a low order.\"\n\n\"There is nothing here with intelligence,\" Ven agreed, gesturing at the\nspecimens in front of us. \"Although they're obviously related to our\nrace, they're quite incapable of constructing those artifacts we saw\non our way down.\"\n\n\"Or of building electone communications or even airboats,\" I added.\n\n\"I expect that there is only one way to get what we want--and that's\nto go looking for it,\" Ven said as she smoothed her antennae with a\nprimary digit. \"I also expect,\" she added acidly, \"that there might\nhave been other places from which it wouldn't be so hard to start\nlooking. Or did you _have_ to set us down in this isolated spot?\"\n\nI glared at her and she flushed a delicate lavender. \"Do you think\nI landed here because I _wanted_ to?\" I asked with some bitterness,\ninflating my cheek pouches to better express my disgust. \"There were\nless than two vards of useful fuel left on the reels when I cut the\ndrives. There isn't enough to take us across this valley. We came\nclose to not making planetfall here at all.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Ven said in a small voice, vocalizing as she always does when she\nis embarrassed. Like most females, she finds it difficult to project\nnormally when she is under emotional stress. Afraid or angry she can\nblow a hole in subspace; but embarrassed, her projections are so faint\nthat I have to strain my antennae to receive them.\n\nHer aura turned a shamefaced nacreous lavender. I couldn't stay angry\nwith her. She was lovely, and I was proud to be her mate. The Eugenics\nCouncil had made an unusually good match when they brought us together.\nThe months we had spent aboard ship on our sabbatical had produced no\nserious personality conflicts. We fitted well, and I was more happy\nthan any Thalassan had a right to be.\n\n\"We shall have to try other measures,\" I said. \"Although there aren't\nvery many natives hereabouts, we had better start looking for them\nrather than wait for them to look for us.\" I felt disappointed. I was\ncertain that we made enough disturbance coming down for them to be here\nin droves, which was why I had the robots camouflage the ship to look\nlike the surrounding rocks. There could be such a thing as too much\nattention.\n\n\"They could have mistaken us for a meteor,\" Ven said.\n\n\"Probably,\" I agreed. \"But it would have saved a great deal of trouble\nif one of them had come to us.\" I sighed. \"Oh well.\"\n\nI added, \"it was only a hope, at best.\"\n\n\"I could explore,\" Ven offered.\n\n\"I was about to suggest that,\" I said. \"After all, the atmosphere is\nbreathable although somewhat rich in oxygen, and the gravity is not too\nsevere. It would be best to wait until dark before starting out. There\nmay be danger. After all, this is an alien world, and Authority knows\nwhat's out there.\"\n\nHer antennae dropped, her aura dimmed to gray and her integument turned\na greenish black. \"It doesn't sound pleasant,\" she said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sun dipped below the horizon with an indecently gaudy display of\ncolor. After the last shades of violet had faded, I opened the airlock\nand watched Ven, a darker blot in the darkness of the night, slip away\ninto the shadows.\n\nShe went unarmed. I wanted her to take a blaster, but she refused,\nsaying that she had never fired one, wouldn't know what to do with\none--and that its weight would hold her back. I didn't like it. But I\nwas unable to go with her, and it was better that she did as she wished\nat this time.\n\nI sat for a while in the entrance port watching the slow wheel of the\nstars across the heavens, and for a moment I wished that I were a\nfemale with the rugged physique to withstand this gravity. As it was,\nthe beauty of the night was lost on me. I breathed uncomfortably as the\npressure crushed my body and made every joint and muscle ache. Males,\nI reflected gloomily, weren't what they were in the old days. Too much\nemphasis on mind, and not enough on body, had made us a sex of physical\nweaklings.\n\nI wondered bitterly if a brain was as worthwhile as the Council\ninsisted.\n\nThe next few hours were miserable. I worried about Ven, imagining a\nnumber of unpleasant things which might have happened to her. I dragged\nmyself into the control room and fiddled with the scanners, trying the\ninfra and ultra bands as well as the normal visible spectrum in the\nhopes of seeing something. And just as I was beginning to feel the\ntwinges of genuine fear, I heard Ven.\n\nHer projection was faint. \"Help me, Eu! Help me!\"\n\nI stumbled to the entrance port, dragging a blaster with me. \"Where are\nyou?\" I projected. I couldn't see her, but I could sense her presence.\n\n\"Here, Eu. Just below you. Help me. I can't make it any farther!\"\n\nSomehow I managed it. I don't know from where the strength came, but\nI was on the ground lifting her, pushing her onto the flat surface of\nthe airlock--clambering up--dragging her in and closing the lock behind\nus. I looked down at her with pride. Who would have thought that I,\na male, could lift a mature female into a ship's airlock even against\nnormal gravity? I chuckled shakily. Strange things happen to a body\nwhen its owner is stressed and its suprarenals are stimulated.\n\nShe looked up at me. \"Thank you,\" she said simply. But there was more\nbehind the words than the bare bones of customary gratitude.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI helped her into the refresher and as she restored her tired body I\npelted her with numerous questions.\n\n\"Did you succeed?\" I asked.\n\n\"Better than I expected.\"\n\n\"Did you find a native?\"\n\n\"Two of them.\" The cubicle glowed a pale green as her strength came\nback.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Two vursts from here--down the hill. They're camped near a road. They\nhave a big ground car with them.\"\n\n\"Did you see them?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What did they look like?\"\n\nThe radiance in the cubicle flicked out. \"They're horrible!\" Ven said.\n\"Monstrous! Four or five times our size! I never saw anything so\nhideous!\"\n\n\"Did they see you?\"\n\n\"No, I don't think so. They weren't looking in my direction at first.\nAnd I don't think they can sense, because I was frightened and they\ndidn't respond to my projection.\" She was beginning to recover.\n\n\"You couldn't have been too frightened,\" I said. \"I didn't hear\nyou--and you can reach farther than two vursts.\"\n\n\"Mostly I was repelled,\" Ven admitted.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I don't know. They smelled bad, but it was more than that. There was\nsomething about them that made my antennae lie flat against my ears.\nAnyway--I did a foolish thing.\" The cubicle turned a pale embarrassed\nlavender.\n\n\"What did you do?\" I demanded.\n\n\"I ran away,\" Ven said. \"And I made a lot of noise.\"\n\n\"All right--all right,\" I said impatiently. \"Go ahead and tell the rest\nof it.\"\n\n\"By the time I stopped running I was down at the bottom of the hill,\"\nVen said. \"I was dead tired--and with all that rock to climb to get\nback to the ship. I didn't really think I'd make it.\"\n\n\"But you did,\" I said proudly. \"You're a real Thalassan--pure green.\"\n\nThe cubicle slowly brightened again.\n\n\"Can you find them again?\" I asked.\n\n\"Of course. I wasn't lost at any time. If I hadn't panicked, I'd have\nbeen back a whole lot sooner.\"\n\n\"Can you go now?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe shivered with distaste. \"I can,\" she said, \"but I don't want to.\"\n\n\"That's nonsense. We can't let a little physical revulsion stop us.\nAfter all, there are some pretty grim things to be seen in this\nuniverse.\"\n\n\"But nothing like this! I tell you, Eu, they're horrible! That's the\nonly word that can describe them.\"\n\n\"Take a stat projector--\" I began.\n\n\"Aren't you coming?\" she asked.\n\n\"Two vursts on this planet? What do you think I am?\"\n\nHer face hardened. \"I don't know,\" she said coldly, \"but I do know\nthis--if you don't come, I won't go.\"\n\nI groaned. From her aura I could tell she meant every word. It\nangered me, too, because Thalassan females usually don't defy a male.\n\"Remember,\" I said icily, \"that you're not the only female on Thalassa.\"\n\n\"We're not on Thalassa,\" she said. Her aura was a curious leaden color,\nshot through with sullen red flares and blotches.\n\n\"I have no right to force you,\" she went on stubbornly, \"but I can't\nhandle them alone. You simply _have_ to come.\"\n\n\"But Ven--I'm a physical cipher. This gravity flattens me. I won't make\nit.\"\n\n\"You will,\" she said. \"I'll help you. But this job needs a male mind.\"\n\nIt was deliberate flattery, I suppose. But there was an element of\ntruth in it. Ven obviously couldn't do it, and obviously she thought I\ncould. I couldn't help feeling pride in her need for me. I liked the\nfeeling. For, after all, we hadn't been mated so long that there was\ntoo great an amount of familiarity in our relationship. The Eugenics\nCouncil had taken care of that very effectively when we announced our\nplans for our sabbatical.\n\n\"All right--I'll go,\" I repeated.\n\nWith a quick light movement she touched my antennae with her primary\ndigits. The shock ran through me clear to my pads. \"You're good,\" she\nsaid--and the way she said it was an accolade.\n\n\nII\n\n\"This way,\" Ven said, emitting a faint yellow aura that lighted the\narea around her. \"Follow me.\" She staggered a little under the weight\nof the equipment she was carrying. I wished that we had enough power\nto energize an air sled---but we had none to spare. The robots had used\nup most of our scanty power metal reserves in camouflaging the ship and\nthe adaptor had taken the rest. This was going to be a miserable trip.\nIt was going to be painful, uncomfortable and perhaps even dangerous.\n\nIt was.\n\nWe went across rocks, through sharp-twigged brush--across the saw-edged\ngrass of the meadow below us, over more rocks, and down-hill along a\nfaint double trail that never seemed to end. I was nearly dead with\nweariness when Ven's aura flicked off and the dark closed in. My\nproprioceptors were screaming as I sank to the ground and panted the\nrich air of this world in and out of my aching chest.\n\n\"They're just ahead,\" Ven whispered. \"Around that next group of rocks.\nBe careful.\"\n\nWe moved forward cautiously. \"There was a fire,\" Ven whispered.\n\n\"There isn't now,\" I said. \"I can't sense any heat.\" The night air\nblew a rank odor to my nostrils. My spines stiffened! I knew what Ven\nmeant when she said that these natives repelled her. I had smelled that\nscent before--the scent of our ancestral enemies! So _these_ were the\nnatives, the dominant life on this planet! I gagged, my tongue thick in\nmy throat.\n\n\"You see?\" Ven asked.\n\nI nodded. \"It's pretty bad,\" I said.\n\n\"It reminds me of a zoo,\" Ven answered softly.\n\nI nodded. It did and it was thoroughly unpleasant.\n\nI strained my perception to its limits, pushing it through the gelid\ndarkness, searching until I found the natives. \"They're asleep,\" I said.\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"Suspension of consciousness. Something like estivation.\"\n\n\"Oh. Then we can approach safely?\"\n\n\"If we are quiet,\" I replied. \"Sleep is broken easily and consciousness\nreturns quickly.\"\n\nThe trail deepened beyond the rocks--two rutted tracks about three\nvards apart. We moved forward cautiously, our senses keyed to their\nhighest pitch. The night was oppressively still and every movement\nrasped loudly. My breath came fast and shallow. My heart pounded and my\nmusk glands were actively secreting as I parted the opening to their\ncloth shelter, and sensed the dim forms within.\n\n\"Stat,\" I projected and Ven handed me the weapon. It was almost more\nthan I could manage in my weakened condition, but I aimed it and fired\na full intensity blast at the nearest lumpy figure. It jerked and\nflopped inside its coverings, and the second form sat up with horrid\nspeed!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA roar of sound came from it as the air was filled with its fetid odor.\nIn panic I triggered a blast at the menacing figure, and it, too,\nflopped and laid still.\n\nI ran my tongue over the roof of my dry mouth and called to Ven.\n\"They're quiet now. Come in and see what we've got.\"\n\n\"Ugh!\" Ven snorted as she entered the tent at my heels. \"It stinks!\"\n\n\"They're not the sweetest life form in the universe,\" I said as I\nprodded the huge mound beside me, looking for reflexes that would\nindicate returning consciousness.\n\n\"What are they?\" Ven asked.\n\n\"Mammals,\" I said.\n\n\"No wonder I thought of a zoo,\" Ven said. \"But they're so big!\"\n\n\"Not on all planets,\" I said.\n\n\"Obviously,\" Ven commented. \"Well--what's next? Let's get this done.\nI'm suffocating!\"\n\n\"Hand me the probe kit,\" I said.\n\nI selected two of the longest probes and made my way up to the head of\nthe nearest monster. I scanned its braincase until I found the area I\nwanted and inserted the probes, driving them through the heavy bone\nand into the brain beneath. I clipped on the short antennae and stepped\nback. \"Turn the control to low,\" I said. \"Place the clips on your\nantennae. Now think of rising.\" The bulk beside me stirred and Ven gave\na squeak of terror. \"It's all right,\" I assured her. \"Turn the control\nback to zero. This one's secure.\"\n\nI went to the second and treated it like the first, and felt\na justifiable pride as it reacted. Not many men could implant\nneuro-probes correctly on the first attempt. \"All right, Ven. You can\ngo out now. Take the controls with you. I'll see what I can do to get\nthese brutes out of their coverings.\"\n\nThe tent opening swayed as Ven passed through and I bent over the\nnearest form. The covering was a heavy sack closed with a slide\nfastener much like the ones we used. I pulled and it opened, sending a\nflood of rank scent into the fetid air. I coughed, my eyes smarting,\nand found the fastener of the other sack. Retching with nausea I\nstaggered out of the tent.\n\nVen sprang forward, caught me as I was about to fall, and lowered me\ngently to the ground.\n\n\"What are we going to do?\" Ven asked as I lay panting at her feet.\n\n\"We're going to get them out of there,\" I said, \"and take them back\nto the ship. I didn't come all this way for nothing.\" I drew one of\nthe controls toward me, fastened the clips to my antennae, advanced\nthe gain and thought into it. There was a stir of movement inside and\na huge form came stumbling out. It stood there clad in loose cloth\ncoverings, reeking with halogen. I looked up at the dark bulk and\nshivered.\n\n\"That smell!\" Ven said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"We can help it a bit,\" I replied and turned to the control. With its\nmassive fore-limbs the brute ripped the cloth from its body as it moved\ndown-wind. I made it stand and took the other control.\n\n\"Let me do it,\" Ven said. \"You can't handle both of them in your\ncondition.\"\n\n\"All right,\" I said, \"but be careful.\"\n\n\"I will. Now what do I do?\"\n\n\"Advance the intensity knob and think what you want it to do.\"\n\nThere was a flurry of movement inside the tent, the thrashing of a huge\nbody, and the second mammal burst through the opening and staggered\nclumsily to a stop.\n\n\"Reduce the intensity,\" I said. \"You're projecting too strong a\nstimulus. Now uncover it and send it over with the other one to cool\noff. They're more bearable when they're cold. They exude the scent from\ntheir skin glands to compensate for temperature.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Ven said. \"I studied biology.\" She did as I instructed and\nthen dropped beside me. We relaxed, gathering our strength for the\nclimb ahead. But I didn't recover rapidly. I could move, but the\nexertion made me dizzy. The excitement was over and reaction had set\nin. \"I'll never make it,\" I said dully.\n\n\"I can help,\" Ven said--\"a little.\"\n\n\"It won't be enough. You don't have the strength to carry me.\" I looked\nat the huge bodies of the mammals gleaming pallidly in the darkness,\nand suddenly I had an idea. The Slaads on Valga domesticated mammals.\nThey were quadrupedal, true enough, but they were still mammals. Why\ncouldn't I ride one of these as they did? Those great masses of muscle\nshould carry me easily. \"I think I have a solution,\" I said.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I'll have one of them carry me.\"\n\n\"You can't!\"\n\n\"Why not? They're controlled. And they're the only way I'll be able to\nget back to the ship.\" I picked up the nearest controller. \"Let's see\nwhat happens.\"\n\nVen squeaked as the monster lifted me in the air and set me across its\nneck. I crossed my pads and hung on. The ground seemed terribly far\naway.\n\n\"How is it up there?\" Ven asked.\n\n\"A little unstable,\" I said, \"but I'll manage. Shall we go?\"\n\nWe moved up the trail to the rocky abutment and turned up the hill. The\nbrute beneath me climbed strongly and easily.\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Ven said as she turned the corner behind me, \"you're\ngoing too fast.\"\n\n\"Why don't you ride?\" I called down to her. \"This one moves easily\nenough. It's much better than walking.\"\n\n\"I think I will,\" Ven replied.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"This is all right,\" Ven said as we moved side by side up the hill.\n\"The fibrils on top of its head--\"\n\n\"Hair,\" I corrected.\n\n\"The hair of this one is longer than yours. I can hold on nicely.\"\n\nThe big bodies of the natives moved smoothly and powerfully, their\ngiant strides eating up the distance we had so painfully covered some\ntime before. Presently we came out onto the lower edge of the meadow\nbelow our ship.\n\nVen looked at me, her aura glowing pink with excitement. \"I'll race you\nto the ship,\" she cried, and dashed off with a burst of speed.\n\nSomehow I couldn't resist the challenge in her voice. I advanced the\ncontrol knob and thought strongly. The brute jumped as though it had\nbeen whipped and leaped into a plunging run. I clung desperately\nfor a moment and then relaxed as I caught the rhythm of the driving\nstrides. My heart pounded, but not with fear. I had never known such\nexhilaration! Machines were pale compared to it. The mammal could run\nlike a frightened skent--and it was faster than Ven's!\n\nI caught her halfway up the meadow, and pulled away, exulting in the\npowerful muscles moving underneath me. I charged up to the grove of\ntrees that concealed our camouflaged ship, and brought the mammal to a\nhalt. It was panting, trembling, drenched with stinking sweat, but I\ndidn't mind. I was part of it. There was a certain amount of feedback\nin a bipolar control circuit and I could feel the heat of its body,\nthe beat of the great heart, the rise and fall of the broad chest, the\npulse of the blood vessels in the thick neck. It was magnificent! I\nlaughed. I had never before felt the ecstasy of physical strength!\n\nI turned and looked back, still tasting the pleasure of the great body\nconnected to my mind.\n\nVen drew up beside me. \"Hai Yee!\" she exclaimed. \"What a sensation!\"\n\n\"You liked it?\" I asked.\n\n\"Liked it? _Liked_ it? I loved it! Didn't you?\"\n\n\"I think so,\" I said truthfully.\n\n\"I'm going across the meadow again,\" Ven said as she turned her mammal\naround.\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"We have use for these two and we have no knowledge of\nhow much they can stand. There's no sense damaging them.\" I frowned as\nI noticed the bloody scratches on the legs and body of her mammal.\n\nVen noted the direction of my gaze. \"They're not as tough as I\nthought,\" she said with sudden contrition. \"But they're not too badly\ndamaged, are they?\"\n\n\"No.\" I said.\n\nI ordered the mammal to set me down. Dawn was breaking and I could\nsee better what we had captured. They were a male and a female.\nOn the whole, except for their mammalian ancestry, they conformed\nto dominant-race criteria, being erect, bipedal, predatory types\nwith binocular vision. Their upper extremities were evolved into\nmanipulative organs similar to our primary digits.\n\nThe most outstanding difference was the extreme sex dimorphism,\nwhich was obviously apparent in the brightening light. The physical\ndifferences were carried to such lengths that it was hard to believe\nthat they were members of the same species.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey weren't exactly ugly, yet there was something disturbing about\nthem. Perhaps it was the rank halogen odor of their skin glands that\nwere still secreting despite the coolness of the air. Or perhaps it was\nmerely that they were intelligent mammals. It was as though Authority\nhad, in a moment of cosmic humor, drawn oversized caricatures of\nThalassans and endowed them with life. I felt a subtle insult in their\npresence. I suppose it showed in my aura because Ven came quickly to my\nside.\n\n\"I told you they were disturbing,\" she said as we looked up at their\nmonstrous forms towering over us.\n\n\"I'm glad they're not uncontrolled,\" I answered, shivering a little as\nI looked at them. \"I suppose it's just species antipathy, but they make\nme uncomfortable.\"\n\n\"Mammals were exterminated on Thalassa long ago, weren't they?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"They ate our eggs.\"\n\nVen walked forward and ran her primary digits over the female's legs.\n\"They're quite well evolved,\" she said. \"The skin hasn't a vestige of\nscales.\"\n\n\"Neither does yours except at the tip of your tail,\" I said tartly.\n\"Don't get the idea that they're a primitive life form. Actually\nthey are a _later_ evolutionary type than we! If our ancestors had\nnot developed intelligence enough to realize their peril we would be\nextinct--and something like them would rule Thalassa today.\"\n\nVen shivered, \"How horrible! I don't like thinking about it.\"\n\n\"Don't,\" I advised.\n\n\"What are we going to do with them?\" Ven asked.\n\n\"I was going to analyze them and construct a proxy, but they're far too\nbig to duplicate with our limited resources. I suppose the only thing\nwe can do is to insert control circuits and use them as they are.\"\n\n\"Won't that be painful?\"\n\n\"Only psychically. Physically they shouldn't suffer a bit. The brain,\nyou know, feels no pain. It merely interprets stimuli from elsewhere.\"\n\n\"In mammals too?\"\n\nI shrugged. \"I suppose so. Besides, what difference does it make?\nOnce we're through with them we can destroy them if they're too badly\ndamaged.\"\n\n\"That seems unfair.\"\n\n\"It's not a question of fairness. It's survival. If they don't perform\nproperly, we shall have to dispose of them or they'll be back here\nwith a whole herd. Of course, if they operate under control, we'll turn\nthem loose when we're through with them. I doubt that their technology\nis advanced enough to recognize a bio-circuit if they saw one. And if\nit is, they will have learned nothing new.\"\n\n\"But why can't we keep them--take them back to Thalassa? They'd make an\nunusual contribution to the Central Zoo.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid not,\" I said. \"I doubt if they'd survive space. The only\npart of the ship large enough to hold them would be the cargo storage\ncompartment, and that's not shielded. A hyperjump would kill them. You\nwouldn't want even them to die _that_ way, would you?\"\n\nHer aura turned gray. \"No, I suppose not.\"\n\n\"There isn't a chance,\" I said, seizing her thought before it was\nuttered. \"It would take ten of our lifetimes to reach our nearest\noutpost on normal spacedrive. Forget it.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Come along,\" I said, \"I'll need your help to modify these brutes.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nActually it wasn't a hard job. Their brains were well developed and\nnicely compartmentalized. With our probes and instruments it was a\nsimple enough matter to implant the necessary organic extensions of\nour instruments.\n\n\"That should do it,\" I murmured as I disconnected the leads I had\njury-rigged into the analyzer. \"They're clean as a Fardel's tooth.\" I\nwas tired, but I had the pleasant feeling of accomplishment that comes\nfrom working with organic matter. Possibly if I were not so interested\nin History, I'd have become a medic. I do have a certain talent along\nthat line.\n\nAt any rate, we now had a pair of proxies. With only normal fortune\nthey would be completely undetectable.\n\n\"Is it all done?\" Ven asked as she looked over my shoulder.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"But leave the probes in place until we test them.\" I\ndragged my weary body once again into the control room and tried the\nheadgear and circuits. They functioned absolutely perfectly.\n\n\"What do we do now?\" Ven's projection came to me.\n\n\"Remove the probes and send them back to their camp. There's no sense\nin leaving them here.\"\n\n\"But Eu--\"\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"They are not toys. They're tools. They're to do a job\nfor us. Now stop acting like a child. When they bring us metal you can\nplay games with them--but not now. They're stressed, tired, and need\nrest. And they're going to get it.\"\n\n\"Yes, Eu.\" Her projection was submissive.\n\n\"But don't worry,\" I added kindly. \"You can monitor them. I installed\ntwo extra circuits, one to the hypothalamus and the other to the\ntactile centers. You will be able to feel every sensation they\nexperience. It will be just like having an extra body.\"\n\n\"Can I try it now?\" she asked eagerly as she came into the control room.\n\n\"Go ahead,\" I said. \"Put on a helmet and use the double control. Take\nthem back to their camp and then neutralize the controller. As for me,\nI'm going to the refresher. I need it.\"\n\n\nIII\n\nI awoke from partial estivation with Ven's projection vibrating my\nantennae. \"Eu! Come quickly! They're awake!\"\n\nI groaned. What did she expect? But it might be interesting to see how\nthey behaved. And if they panicked, someone should be there to assume\ncontrol.\n\nI checked the chronometer. I had rested for eight satts which should be\nenough. I felt as well as could be expected, so with only a few choice\nLow-Thalassic expletives to help me, I managed to clamber out of the\ntank and stagger into the control room. Ven already had one of the\nhelmets on. I picked up the other and flicked the switch to \"on.\" It\nwas the male's--and he was talking. The words were gibberish, but the\nthoughts behind them were easy to read.\n\nI was part of an entity called Donald G. Carlton, a male mammal of\nthe human species. He was a \"writer\" and was mated to the female, who\nwas called Edith and who worked in \"motion pictures.\" They lived in\na place called Hollywood, in a family unit structure faintly similar\nto a children's creche. Custom on this world dictated that the female\ntake one name of her mate, which indicated that the sex was even more\nsubservient than female Thalassans. The male's body ached, but not\nas badly as I would have expected. And, as I expected, there was no\nsensitivity in the brain.\n\n\"Hey! Edith!\" Donald said. \"Get up!\"\n\n\"Leave me alone, Don. I'm miserable,\" a lighter voice answered from the\nlumpy sack beside him. \"I had the most awful dream.\"\n\n\"It must be the mountain air,\" he replied. \"I did too.\"\n\n\"Whatever made me think this would be fun!\" Edith said. \"You and your\nmeteor-hunting!\" The sack heaved and twisted and her head appeared at\none end. \"I feel like I've been worked over with a baseball bat. Oh!\nMy legs!\"\n\n\"You're not alone,\" he said. \"I guess it's the hard ground and these\nstrait-jackets they laughingly call sleeping bags.\"\n\n\"About that dream,\" Edith said. \"It was horrible. There was this little\ngreen and yellow thing that looked like a cross between a lizard and a\nhuman being. It was sitting on my shoulders and I was naked--carrying\nit around, doing what it wanted me to do! I wanted to throw it off and\nstamp on it but I couldn't. I just ran and ran and all the time that\nlittle monster sat with its legs around my neck, hooting like an owl.\nNow, wasn't that something?\"\n\nDonald was very quiet. \"You know,\" he said slowly, \"essentially that\nwas the same dream I had.\"\n\n\"But that can't be! People don't have the same nightmares.\"\n\n\"We did.\"\n\n\"Then maybe--maybe it wasn't a nightmare!\"\n\n\"Nonsense. We're here. We're all right. But I think perhaps we'd better\nget out of here--oh, Keerist! I'm one solid bruise.\" He twisted around\nuntil he found the fastenings and opened the bag. With a groan he stood\nup.\n\nEdith looked at him, her eyes wide with sudden terror. \"Don,\" she said\nin a brittle voice, \"didn't you wear pajamas when you went to bed last\nnight?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, you're not wearing them now.\" An expression of horror crossed\nher face. \"And neither am I,\" she added in a small voice.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI could feel the shock in Donald's brain as he looked down at himself.\n\"That's not all I'm not wearing,\" he said dully. \"I'm shaved!\"\n\nThere was a brief flurry inside the other sleeping bag. \"So am I!\"\nEdith's voice was a whisper of fright. \"That was no dream! I remember\nthis. The lizard gave me something that I rubbed all over myself--and\nmy hair came off. I didn't want to, but I couldn't help myself.\" Her\nhands went to her head and she sighed, \"Well, _that's_ all there. For a\nmoment I thought--\"\n\n\"My skin is different,\" Donald interrupted thoughtfully as he inspected\nhimself. \"It feels thicker. And I don't feel cold, although I'll bet\nit's nearly freezing outside.\"\n\n\"Don! Don't you understand? That dream was real!\" Edith said.\n\n\"Of course it was,--unless _this_ is a dream. We could be having a\nnightmare about a nightmare....\"\n\nI looked at Ven.\n\n\"Just what did you do to them?\" I asked.\n\nShe glowed guiltily. \"I didn't know it would take their hair off,\" she\nsaid. \"I was worried about their scratches, and the insects were biting\nthem. So I made them rub on some of our skin conditioner.\"\n\nI raised my digits toward the sky. \"There is an Authority that looks\nover fools and Thalassan females,\" I said. \"What made you so sure our\nconditioner would work on them? It might have been poisonous.\"\n\n\"I tried it on the male first,\" Ven said.\n\n\"Genius,\" I breathed with icy sarcasm, \"sheer genius!\"\n\n\"Well,\" she said, \"it worked!\" The eternal pragmatist had applied her\nsole criterion. \"And what's more they looked and smelled lots better\nafter they used it.\"\n\nI shrugged, gave it up and turned my attention back to the mammals.\n\nEdith had emerged from her sack and was standing before the male.\n\n\"Do I look like a nightmare?\" she demanded.\n\n\"No. More like a skinned rabbit--ouch! What did you do that for?\" He\nrubbed his face where she struck him with her digits.\n\n\"There!\" Edith said. \"_Now_ do you think it's a dream?\"\n\n\"I never did,\" he replied mildly. \"I've never dreamed in my life. I\nwas just breaking it to you easy. It was real enough--even the blank\nspaces. I wonder--\"\n\n\"You wonder what?\"\n\n\"What their reason was for capturing us and then letting us go. It\ndoesn't make sense. They wouldn't grab us just for fun. They're\nobviously intelligent, and probably thought we would be useful to them.\nBut they turned us loose. So we couldn't be useful except maybe for\namusement--but that doesn't jell. No. They've done something to us.\nThey've let us go for a reason.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Stop analyzing!\" Edith said. \"Why don't you just get scared, like I\nam!\"\n\n\"I _am_,\" he said, \"but I like to figure things out. If I know what\nfrightens me, it doesn't bother me so much.\"\n\n\"Do that while we're on the way home. Get your clothes on and let's get\nout of here! Right away!\"\n\n\"We have to pack.\"\n\n\"Oh, leave it! Let's get out while we can!\"\n\n\"I don't think we're in any danger,\" he said.\n\n\"Well--I don't want to stay here a minute longer!\"\n\n\"All right. We'll go. But we'll pack first. Look at it logically. They\nhad us cold. We didn't escape. We were _let_ go. So why, if they didn't\nwant us then, should they want us now?\"\n\n\"Unless they can get us any time they want us.\"\n\n\"You have a point there, but if that's the case, they can get us\nanyway. So let's pack.\"\n\n\"You can pack if you want to. I'm leaving!\" Edith pulled the opening to\nthe tent and slipped out.\n\n\"Edith!\" Donald cried. \"Wait!\"\n\nI touched Ven. \"Stop her,\" I said.\n\nEdith's voice came from outside. \"Don!\" she called in a tight voice.\n\"Don! Help me! _I can't move!_\"\n\n\"Try coming back here and see what happens,\" Donald said slowly.\n\nEdith's head appeared in the entrance. \"I'm back,\" she said in a small\nvoice.\n\n\"I thought you would be. Now let's pack and perhaps they'll let us go.\nIt's obvious that we can't run away.\"\n\n\"But why? _What's happened to us?_\"\n\n\"If I told you, you'd think I'm crazy.\"\n\n\"Tell me anyway. It can't be any worse than this.\"\n\n\"I think,\" Donald said slowly as he began to roll up his sleeping bag,\n\"that we were kidnapped by extraterrestrials.\"\n\n\"Martians?\"\n\n\"Not necessarily,\" he said. \"But if I remember my nightmare correctly,\nthey aren't human--and they are obviously smart. So they aren't of this\nearth. We don't have intelligent reptiles here. And with their ability\nto control our actions, I'd say that they were from a considerably\nhigher culture than ours. They've done things to us--but I don't think\nthey did them just for fun. They want us to do something.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Right now I'd guess they want us to pack our things.\nLet's do it and get out of here. This place smells like the reptile\nhouse in the zoo!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was amazed. The native's analysis was as logical as my own would have\nbeen under similar circumstances. There was nothing wrong with his mind\nor with his courage. That big braincase held a smoothly functioning\nmind and a cold courage I could almost envy. In a similar fix I wasn't\nsure that I could be so calm.\n\nMy respect for him mounted. If there were others like him on this\nworld, his race could be a potential danger spot for the whole Galaxy.\nAnd, with the natural antipathy between our races, these creatures\ncould be _trouble_ if they ever reached space. I wondered for a moment\nif Authority had known this when It brought me here. There must be some\ndesign that I should land here when this race was still capable of\nbeing frustrated.\n\nFor the sake of civilization I would have to learn more about these\nmammals. Much more. But since the male had deduced so much, there was\nonly one logical course of action. I adjusted the filters on my helmet\nto allow the passage of surface thoughts, twisted the dials on the\ncontroller until the meters balanced and projected gently.\n\n\"Donald--listen to me,\" I said.\n\nHe stiffened. \"I thought you would be somewhere around,\" he said. \"Who\nare you?\"\n\n\"My name is Eu Kor, and I am a native of Thalassa.\"\n\n\"Where's that?\"\n\n\"A good many spatial units from here--a good many of your light years,\"\nI amended. \"I mean you no harm, but I need your cooperation. My\nspaceship is crippled. Our fuel has deteriorated. We need more and I\nwant you to get it for us. We captured you because we need your help.\nBeing a native you would not make a ripple in this society. And we\nwould create whirlpools.\"\n\n\"What is this material you want?\"\n\n\"A metal. Atomic number 50, a white metal used as an alloy component\nof primitive metallic cultures,\" I said. \"It shouldn't be too hard to\nget.\" I didn't realize how hard it was to describe what I wanted. I\nwasn't getting through, and it bothered me. The culture barrier was\nalmost as bad as though we couldn't contact mind to mind.\n\n\"I think you mean tin,\" he said. I grasped the concept and it seemed\nright.\n\n\"Bring me some and I will run tests,\" I said.\n\n\"And what do I get in return?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI thought quickly. If he wanted to bargain perhaps we could reach an\nagreement. It's always better to have a cooperative proxy. They don't\ncause nearly the trouble in management. And I had other things to do\nthan monitor natives. There was a great deal of repair work to be done\non the ship before she would fly again. The subspace radio power bank\nhad to be rebuilt and the circuits should be checked.\n\n\"I can give you knowledge that you wouldn't have for decades--maybe\ncenturies,\" I said. \"And I can adjust your bodies for a longer and\nhappier life.\" I shot a glance at Ven still immersed in her helmet.\n\"In fact, I have made a few adjustments already.\"\n\n\"So I noticed,\" Donald thought dryly. \"Although whether they're an\nimprovement or not I couldn't say. But did you have to go to all this\ntrouble?\"\n\n\"Think of us--and discount the fact that you carried us because our\nbodies are too weak for your heavy world.\" I said. \"Did you like us?\"\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"You repelled me. I disliked you on sight, more than I\ncan say.\"\n\n\"The emotion is mutual,\" I said. \"Yet I can endure you. But with your\nglandular outlook you could only think of destroying us.\"\n\n\"That is true. But you treated us like animals.\"\n\n\"You are animals,\" I said logically.\n\n\"We are masters of this world. We recognize no higher authority. We are\nfree people--not slaves. And unless we are treated as free agents you\nwill get no cooperation from us.\"\n\n\"I can force you to do as I wish,\" I said.\n\n\"Prove it!\"\n\nI took over. And while Donald watched with helpless horror his hand\npicked up a knife and drew it across his arm. The keen edge split the\ntissues neatly and the blood flowed.\n\n\"Don! What are you doing!\" Edith screamed and then stiffened as Ven\ntook control.\n\n\"Observe,\" I said as I released control.\n\n\"Why, you--\" Donald began--and then continued in a tone of wonder.\n\"Why--the cut's closing! There's no more blood--It's gone!\"\n\n\"It's just one of the improvements I mentioned,\" I said smugly. \"You\nalso had a patch of scar tissue on your left lung and infected kidneys.\nYou do not have them now. Had you not met us you would have been dead\nwithin five of your years.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was shaken. I could feel it. \"I do have Bright's disease,\" he said\nthoughtfully.\n\n\"You had it,\" I corrected.\n\n\"All right,\" he said suddenly, \"I'll bargain with you. You've done me a\ngood turn and it deserves a payment. I'll help you get your metal.\" He\ngrinned ruefully. \"I guess I couldn't do anything else.\"\n\n\"It makes it easier this way,\" I said. I smiled to myself. I was\ntelling him the truth, but not all of it. Nor did I trust him. There\nwas fear and hatred in his lower centers, and a formless feeling in his\nupper levels that he could outsmart any damn lizard that ever lived. He\ndidn't realize that I could read his surface thoughts.\n\n\"Just remember,\" I said, \"I can control you completely, if necessary,\nand pick your brain for data whether you wish it or not. And forget\nthose ideas of informing your authorities about us. Except with your\nmate you cannot communicate to anyone about us. There's a basic block\nin your brain that will result in irreversible mental damage if you\ntry.\"\n\nThis last was not quite the truth. But I hoped that by establishing\nfear I would prevent talk. \"Now find us samples of the metal I want.\" I\nwithdrew and went back to scanning.\n\n\"What was going on there?\" Edith said. \"You were talking to empty air.\nAnd why did you cut yourself?\"\n\n\"It was one of our reptilian friends,\" Don said. \"Like I thought,\nthey're right with us--every way. He's a weird sort. Wants to trade\nhealth and knowledge for tin.\"\n\n\"Tin?\"\n\n\"Yeah. At least I think it's tin. His description of the metal fits.\nThey use it instead of rocket juice.\"\n\n\"But that knife--your arm?\"\n\n\"Look. No cut--no blood. That's one of the things they did to us. We've\ngot puncture-proof skin.\"\n\n\"Is that good?\"\n\n\"It isn't bad. And I don't think I'll ever have to shave again. As I\nremember I put that stuff on my face. Anyway, we now have a couple\nof fairy godmothers who ride around in spaceships instead of pumpkin\ncoaches.\"\n\n\"You're mixing your stories,\" Edith said. \"Cinderella travelled in the\npumpkin coach, not her fairy godmother. And besides, it's not funny.\nWe're more like those poor souls in the Middle Ages who were possessed\nby devils--incubuses, I think they called them.\"\n\n\"It makes no difference what you call them,\" Donald said indifferently.\n\"Whatever they are, we've got them and they're not going to leave until\nthey're damn good and ready. Incidentally, yours is a female, so she's\nprobably a succubus. Now don't start screaming. You'll probably be\nparalyzed if you do.\"\n\n\"I won't scream,\" Edith said dully. \"I'm too numb to scream.\"\n\n\nIV\n\nWe had surprisingly little trouble with the two natives once they\nrealized we could control them if we wished. Of the two, Edith was the\nworst. She refused to cooperate and had to be forced into the simplest\nactions.\n\n\"We're going to have trouble with that one,\" I observed as Ven looked\nat me with faint exasperation in her yellow eyes.\n\n\"Oh, I don't think so,\" she said. \"Not really. This is a normal female\nreaction. It's a phase. Like the way I felt when the Eugenics Council\nselected me to be your mate.\"\n\n\"Did you feel like that?\" I asked with surprise.\n\n\"Of course. I wanted to make my own choice.\"\n\n\"But you never told me.\"\n\n\"There was no need. I came around to the Council's view before I met\nyou. And Edith will come around to mine. Don't worry. I know how to\nhandle this.\"\n\nAnd she did.\n\nI helped a little by altering a few reflex arcs and basic attitudes,\nbut Ven wouldn't allow me to modify the higher centers.\n\n\"There's no need to make her a mindless idiot,\" Ven said. \"You didn't\ndo that to Donald.\"\n\n\"Yes, but Donald controls his emotions. He doesn't like me any better\nthan Edith likes you, but he doesn't work himself into an emotional\nhomogenate every time I make a suggestion. We argue it out like\nrational intelligences. Often I can use his experience and viewpoint.\nAnd when I can't agree, he will cooperate rather than operate under\ncontrol. He's not like that bundle of glands and emotions you are\ntrying to make into a useful proxy.\"\n\n\"She _is_ a problem,\" Ven admitted, \"but if I had her here--\"\n\n\"That can be arranged,\" I said. \"I'll give you two weeks. And if that\ndoesn't work you let me perform a prefrontal block.\"\n\n\"That isn't very long.\"\n\n\"That's all we can afford, I told her.\n\n\"All right, I can try. In a month I know I could do it.\"\n\nDonald protested violently when I told him what we planned for Edith,\nbut when I gave him the alternative, he reluctantly agreed.\n\nHe passed a story that Edith would be visiting friends, and brought her\nto the ship.\n\nAt once Ven went systematically to work to reduce the mammal to an\nacquiescent state that would permit control. Since sleep is unknown\nto our race but necessary for mammals, the task of breaking down the\nfemale's resistance was simplified by physical exhaustion. Ven also\nfound that the mammal's sleeping time could be used to strengthen the\nnew reflex channels built during her waking periods. The results were\namazing, even to me, and I'm fairly well trained in neuromanipulation.\nHalfway through the second week the mammal's surrender was complete.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Another day and she can go back,\" Ven said. \"I can finish her training\nat long range. Now that I have the channels established, I don't think\nshe'll be any further trouble.\"\n\nI took the helmet and scanned Edith. \"Hmm,\" I said. \"Do you know what\nyou've done? You've built yourself into an Authority image.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Ven said smugly. \"She is essentially a dependent type. Her\nmate was her decision maker. That's why I had to get her alone. It\nwasn't too hard once I knew where to look. As a girl, her mother made\nthe decisions for her. As a woman, Donald has done it. And when I faced\nher with situations where she had to decide and where the decisions\nwere invariably wrong, she transferred the decision-making power to me.\"\n\nI looked at her sharply. \"I had no idea that you intended to make a pet\nout of her,\" I said. \"Otherwise I wouldn't have permitted this.\"\n\n\"Well, it's too late now. And besides, it was the only way I could do\nit in the time you allotted. But don't worry. She'll be as good a tool\nas your precious Donald--maybe even a better one--because she'll do\nthings to please me and not merely because they're expedient.\"\n\nVen had a point there. But it isn't a good policy to get emotionally\ninvolved with alien races. However, the deed was done, and as long as\nVen was happy I didn't care. I only hoped that she wouldn't become too\nattached to the creature.\n\nDonald was much more cooperative and much tougher. He had realized from\nthe start that there was no profit in objecting to my demands. But,\nunlike Edith, he gave me no handle for leverage. He arranged his life\nto include the unpleasant fact of my existence, and that was that.\nWhere Ven achieved a form of mastery, I never received anything more\nthan acquiescence. There were levels in Donald I could not touch. At\nfirst it irked me, but then I realized that I was the greater gainer.\nFor Donald was a constant challenge, a delight to the mind, an outward\ncollaborator and an inward enemy. Our relationship had all the elements\nof an armed truce. And I often thought that if I did not have the\ncrushing advantage of control, our contest might have been more even.\n\nAlthough in time Donald's hatred became modified to a grim sort of\ntolerance, and his repulsion into something that closely resembled\nadmiration, he never lost the basic species antipathy which separated\nus. And in that regard our feelings were mutual. The ancient Thalassan\nproverb that familiarity breeds friendship simply didn't apply. We held\na mutual respect for each other, and in a fashion we cooperated, but I\nnever could pierce the armor of resentment that shielded him. I tried,\nbut finally I gave up. There would never be friendship between us. We,\nwere too different--\n\nAnd too alike.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the days that followed the first contact, I proceeded according\nto approved methods of investigating alien civilizations. At my\nrequest, Donald went to the local book repository and we went through\na number of works on law, government, social structure, and finance.\nI felt that I should have some knowledge of this mammalian culture\nbefore attempting to refuel the ship. There was no sense in calling\nattention to myself any more than necessary. If I could obtain what I\nwanted and leave quietly, I would be perfectly happy. This world was\nof interest--but it was too disturbing to contemplate for an extended\nperiod of time.\n\n\"You were right, Eu Kor,\" Ven said to me as we scanned the pattern of\nthe mammals' culture. \"If you had picked any place less isolated than\nthis, we might have been engulfed in that maelstrom.\"\n\nI nodded. \"It was more luck than design,\" I said, \"but I am happy that\nwe are no closer. This world is not for us. It is too strange, too\nalien with its uncontrolled emotionalism and frightening energy.\"\n\n\"It reminds me of a malignant neoplasm,\" Ven said, \"growing\nuncontrolled, destroying the body from which it draws sustenance.\nHave you ever seen such a seething flux of people--such growth--such\nappalling waste and carelessness?\"\n\nI shook my head. \"The only parallel that comes to mind is Sennor.\"\n\n\"But that's a dead world--killed by a suicidal race that achieved\ntechnology before it had attained culture.\"\n\n\"Which is precisely the situation we have here. Or have you observed\ntheir social inequities and history? Periodically these mammals erupt\nin merciless riots and slaughters over things that could be settled by\nreason. And oddly enough, these 'wars' as humans call them have the\neffect of stimulating technology. This is a race that apparently loves\ndeath and battle. A barbaric horde of cultural morons, with a civilized\ntechnology geared to mutual destruction.\"\n\n\"Frankly, I've been scanning through Edith. I've seen only the\ntechnical excellence of their entertainment industry, and the enormous\nwaste which goes into the making of one of their productions.\"\n\n\"We must have a synthesis,\" I said, \"and pool our observations.\"\n\nVen nodded.\n\n\"I'm not at all happy about this place,\" I continued. \"It makes me\nuncomfortable.\"\n\n\"Could we modify it?\" Ven asked.\n\nI shook my head. \"It would take an entire task force to do that.\nReeducation of this culture would have to begin at birth after\nappropriate culling. We would have to start from the beginning. I fear\nthat the council would never authorize such an action on behalf of\nmammals. We are altruistic ... but not that altruistic.\"\n\n\"Then they will destroy themselves?\"\n\n\"I fear so. This culture has a poor prognosis. But it is perhaps better\nso. Or would you like to see them roaming through the Galaxy?\"\n\nVen shuddered. \"Not as they are now. Not these fierce, combative stupid\nbrutes. Individuals perhaps, but not the race. They would have to learn\nthe rules of civilization first.\"\n\n\"Yet they show no sign of learning. If they can't even cooperate with\ntheir own species, how in Authority's name could they ever get along\nwith the dissimilar races of this island universe?\"\n\n\"They couldn't. We would have to quarantine them.\"\n\n\"So isn't it better to save the expense and let them quarantine\nthemselves?\"\n\n\"I suppose so.\" Ven's aura was a dull gray and mine matched the gloom\nof hers. It is hard to stand aloof and watch a race condemn itself to\ndeath.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe fed our observations into the analyzer, together with all extraneous\ndata we could lay our digits on via our proxies--not to prove our\nconclusions but to determine the means by which we could obtain the\npower metal with the least possible repercussions in this society. We\nboth realized it would be fatal to expose ourselves. The mammalian\ntechnology was sufficiently advanced for them to duplicate the\nessential portions of our ship, and chaos could result if they secured\na road to the stars. Generations of effort would be required to confine\nthem again to their homeworld.\n\nThinking in this manner caused me to take certain precautions with the\ndrive mechanism that would ensure no trace of our craft remaining if I\nprojected a certain impulse at a given strength. Ven, of course, was\nappalled at my action, although she realized its grim necessity.\n\nAnd in the meantime we worked with our proxies, I attempting to\nestablish some means of quietly obtaining the metal we needed, and\nVen doing nothing so far as I could determine that would further our\nmission. At that, Edith was in no position to obtain metal, and Ven was\ntoo young and inexperienced in contact work to attempt a mission of\nsuch delicacy. Since Edith amused her, I was content to leave them both\nto their own devices while I worked with Donald to speed our departure.\n\n\"In this society,\" I said to Donald, \"it seems that one can accomplish\nanything with this medium of exchange you call money.\"\n\n\"That's close to a fundamental truth,\" Donald replied.\n\n\"And you are not too well supplied with it?\" I asked.\n\n\"Those four ingots I brought you last week put a vicious dent in our\nsavings account.\"\n\n\"Isn't your trade as an author profitable?\"\n\n\"Only in spurts. It's a feast-famine existence. But it's the only one I\ncare to lead.\"\n\n\"But popular fiction makes money--and you can write.\"\n\n\"I wish you'd tell that to my agent. He seems to have other ideas.\"\n\n\"I have recently read some of your fiction,\" I said, \"and have noticed\nthat it has certain basics that could easily be applied to an analyzer.\nThere is no reason why we could not cooperate and produce a work that\nwould yield a great deal of money.\"\n\nDonald laughed. \"Now I've heard everything!\" he said. \"You mean to tell\nme _you_ could write a book _humans_ would buy?\"\n\n\"No, you would write the book. I would merely furnish the idea, the\nresearch data, the plot, and the general story outline. In your popular\nfiction,\" I continued, \"there are four basic elements and a plot\nthat can be varied about twenty-five ways. There is small need for\nphilosophy and little need for abstract thought. In fact, there is no\nneed at all for anything but glandular excitation. All that is really\nnecessary is plenty of action, enough understanding of the locale and\nevents to avoid anachronism--and the basics.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What are these basics?\" Donald said. \"As a writer I'd like to know\nthem.\"\n\n\"There are four,\" I ticked them off on my digits. \"First, violation\nof the ethical or moral code of your race; second, adequate amounts\nof cohabitation between the characters; third, brutality; and\nfourth--murderous assault.\"\n\n\"Hmm. Sin, sex, sadism and slaughter,\" Donald commented. \"You know, you\nmight have something there.\"\n\n\"I have prepared an outline and a synopsis of such a book,\" I said. \"It\nis a historical novel. It should sell. Most historical novels do.\"\n\n\"You've done what?\" Donald gasped. Then he laughed. \"Of all the\ninsufferable egoists I've ever seen!\"\n\n\"Listen,\" I said, ordering him to silence while I outlined the opening\nchapter.\n\n\"I can't stop you,\" Donald said. \"But why should this happen to me?\nIsn't it bad enough to be bossed around by you lizards without having\nto be forced to ghost-write your amateur literary efforts?\"\n\n\"It is laid in the period of your history called the Renaissance,\" I\ncontinued, \"and deals with a young man of a noble but impoverished\nhouse who rose to power by cleverness, amorality and skill with the\nsword.\"\n\n\"I suppose the girl is the daughter of the local duke.\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, \"she is the favorite wife of a Saracen corsair.\"\n\n\"Well, that's a switch,\" Donald said. \"Tell me more.\"\n\nSo I did. I outlined the opening and told him the major points of\nthe whole story ... as the computer had synthesized it out of seven\nexcellent novels of the period and a four-volume set of Renaissance\nhistory.\n\nDonald was enthralled. \"You're right,\" he said. \"It will sell. It's\nlousy literature, but it's got appeal. With this story and my writing\nwe can out-Spillane Mickey.\" He was more enthusiastic than I had ever\nseen him appear before.\n\n\"Who is Spillane?\" I asked.\n\nDonald looked at me as though he thought I was crazy and shook his\nhead. \"I can get to work on it as soon as I get home,\" Donald said.\n\"And if I keep at it, it'll be ready for mailing in a couple of weeks.\nI'll get it off to my agent and we'll see. I hate to admit it, but I\nthink you're right about the yarn. It should sell like hotcakes.\"\n\n\"That is fine. It should provide us with the medium of exchange, which\nis necessary in this society.\"\n\n\"It's not necessary,\" Donald grinned. \"It's essential.\"\n\n\nV\n\nDonald's prediction was a good one. The book sold--and sold well.\nDespite the outright plagiarism of ideas and source material it was\nhailed as a new novel--one that stimulated thought with its realistic\napproach to the life of the times. And we prospered amazingly.\n\nWith the advance money, I had Donald buy the land on which the ship\nwas resting, together with the valley and rimrock. Having thus secured\nour landing site I felt a bit more comfortable. The comfort was even\ngreater when, at Donald's suggestion, a fence was placed around the\nproperty and electronic tell-tales were installed. The remainder of the\nroyalties were used to purchase tin and supplies.\n\nBut despite our prosperity and the regular supply of tin that came to\nme as a result of my adventure in fiction, and the certainty that Ven\nand I would be leaving, Donald was not happy.\n\nAs a successful new author he had to travel to meetings in various\ncities. He had to speak at public gatherings. He had to meet with\npublishers eager to receive rights to his next book. And Edith did not\ngo with him.\n\nVen was adamant on this point. \"It's bad enough that she is working\non this motion picture,\" she said, \"but I'm not going to have her\ntraveling all over the face of this planet. She's the only amusement I\nhave since we must stay cooped up in this place. I'm not going to let\nher go.\"\n\nDonald was upset about it. He was so angry that he came to visit me\nvoluntarily, and the sight of Edith's little car parked under the trees\nbelow the ship infuriated him even more. It took the controller to make\nhim keep his distance as he stood in front of the airlock and hated me.\n\n\"Damn you!\" he swore. \"You can't do this to me! Edith's my wife and I\ndon't like this relationship between her and that--that _dinosaur_! It\nisn't healthy.\"\n\n\"It's out of my hands,\" I said. \"Edith is Ven's responsibility.\"\n\n\"It's not only that,\" he raged. \"Ever since you lizards butted into our\nlives Edith looks at me like I was a stranger.\" His face twisted. \"I'll\nadmit she has her reasons. But that gives her no call to ask Ven's\nadvice rather than mine. When I told her I wanted her to come with me,\nthe first thing she said was that she'd ask Ven. She doesn't do one\ndamn thing without that cold-blooded little monster's consent! She even\nasks advice on what clothes she should wear!\" He laughed harshly. \"The\nblind asking advice from the blind!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI couldn't help chuckling. Ven, like all Thalassans, had never worn\nanything in her life except a utility belt. Clothing has never been a\nfeature of our culture. Since it isn't necessary on Thalassa, it was\nnever developed, and since our sex impulses are periodic it has never\nbeen useful to attract either males or females. \"I can see your point,\"\nI said. \"Ven's ideas along that line would be zero.\"\n\n\"Not quite,\" Donald said angrily. \"She likes moccasins. Apparently they\nmake feet look more like your pads.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"But that's it! Edith's idea of what a well-dressed housewife should\nwear is--_moccasins_! She damn near caused a riot the other day when\nour TV repairman called to fix the set. We'll be lucky if we're not\nforced to move because of that little incident!\"\n\n\"I'll speak to Ven,\" I said. \"And if that doesn't work, I'll insert\na block against such a thing happening again. I don't want special\nattention called to you. That sort of thing will stop right now.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Donald said. \"But I should be the one to stop it.\"\n\n\"Face it,\" I replied, \"you aren't. Not now. But you will be once we're\ngone.\"\n\n\"Which can't be too soon to suit me,\" he said. \"I spend every spare\nmoment collecting tin for you. Edie doesn't. She _wants_ Ven to stay.\"\n\n\"They seem to be happy with each other. Edith comes up here regularly.\"\n\n\"I know,\" he said bitterly. \"She's here more often than she's home. I\ncan't see what fun she gets out of running around these hills stripped\nto the skin carrying your mate on her shoulders.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't know,\" I said. \"Certainly you never seem to enjoy\nperforming that service for me.\"\n\n\"I don't even like the thought of it. I'm not an animal, after all.\"\n\n\"But you are,\" I said. \"So am I. The only difference is that I am a\nsuperior animal and you, being inferior, conform to my wishes. It is a\nlaw of nature that the superior type will inevitably rule. The inferior\neither conforms or dies. And you have no desire to die.\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"But I can still object,\" he said.\n\n\"At that?\" I asked pointing across the meadow with a primary digit.\n\nEdith was running, her long yellow hair floating free behind her.\nVen, high on her shoulders in a seat the two of them had contrived,\nwaved gaily at us as they came up. Edith was flushed and laughing. Her\neyes sparkled and her smooth bronze body gleamed in the sunlight. She\nlowered Ven to the ground, slipped the harness off her smooth shoulders\nand stood behind my mate, breathing deeply but not at all distressed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Oh, Donald!\" she said. \"We had a wonderful climb--clear up to the top\nof the ridge! And coming down was almost like flying! I'll tell you all\nabout it in a minute, right after I take a dip in the pool. Ven doesn't\nlike it when I sweat.\" She turned and ran down to the little pool in\nthe meadow.\n\n\"See what I mean!\" Donald gritted.\n\n\"She seems happy. She's not hurt. And Ven's little weight doesn't seem\nto bother her. What are you complaining about?\"\n\nDonald growled something unintelligible, turned on his heel and walked\naway.\n\nI let him go. There was no sense in making him angrier than he was.\nAfter a moment the snarl of his car's engine rose to a crescendo then\nfaded away into the distance.\n\nA few minutes later Edith came back to the ship. \"Why did Don leave?\"\nshe asked.\n\n\"Perhaps he had something to do,\" Ven said.\n\nShe pouted. \"He's always so busy nowadays,\" she said sulkily. \"He isn't\nnice like he used to be. Do you think he's tired of me?\"\n\n\"No, I don't think so. He just doesn't like you spending so much time\nup here,\" I said.\n\n\"But it's fun--and Ven likes it,\" she said. \"I like it too. And since\nhe isn't home much any more, it's the only place where I can relax and\nbe myself.\" She brushed the drops of water from her body and shook out\nher damp hair. \"It's wonderful up here--so quiet and peaceful--and\nVen's so nice.\"\n\nMy mate's aura glowed a pleased pink as I turned an embarrassed\nlavender. It was almost criminal, I thought, what Ven had done to\nthe girl. Donald might be my servant, but I had never attempted to\ncondition him into liking it. As much as possible we operated as\nequals, rather than in this sickening relationship which Ven had\nimposed upon Edith. To avoid showing my displeasure I went up to the\ncontrol room, donned my helmet and went into rapport with Donald.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said. \"I hadn't realized the true situation. The best\nthing for both of us is for Ven and me to leave as quickly as possible.\"\n\n\"How quick is that?\" he shot back angrily.\n\n\"Four thousand pounds more,\" I said.\n\n\"Whew! That can must drink tin.\"\n\n\"It takes a great deal to leave a planet,\" I said. \"And hyperspace\ndemands a great deal more. Once we develop an inertialess drive it will\nbe easier. But we've only been working on it a thousand years. These\nthings take time.\"\n\n\"I imagine. Well, are you going to do anything about Edith?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"It would only make things worse. The relationship has\ngone too far. Ven has become an Authority-image.\"\n\n\"You could break it.\"\n\n\"But I won't. I'm fond of Ven.\"\n\n\"You're a damned little tyrant,\" Donald said. \"You like to see a human\nsquirm.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Be thankful that I'm the worst tyrant you'll see,\" I answered sharply.\n\"You could really learn about them if the Slaads knew you existed.\nThey're more advanced than you. And, unlike us, they're warlike and\npredatory. They breed mammals for food. However, I'll put up a marker\non your moon before I leave. They respect Thalassa and won't preempt\nour claims.\"\n\n\"You mean you're going to lay claim to Earth?\"\n\n\"Only technically. We'll exercise it only if the Governing Council\ndecides it will be to our advantage.\"\n\n\"What would you do if you took over?\" Don asked curiously.\n\n\"Clean things up,\" I said. \"Stop wars, stabilize the population,\nincrease production and distribution, give you an effective central\ngovernment and an understandable legal code, and eliminate the unfit.\nIn three generations you'd be Class VI all over your planet.\"\n\n\"It sounds good. What's the catch.\"\n\n\"The catch,\" I said, \"is that you wouldn't like it. You mammals are\nerratic, emotional and uncontrolled. You do not reason well, and you\nhave no race discipline.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"The capability of sacrificing units for the benefit of the whole.\nEugenics control, culling the unfit.\"\n\n\"You're talking about human beings!\" Donald exploded.\n\n\"And what makes a human being different from any other animal?\" I\nasked. \"Would you hesitate to dispose of an animal that was unfit to\nbreed?\"\n\nHe sighed. \"No,\" he said. \"But that's not the same.\"\n\n\"What's the difference? And realize, it's done for your betterment.\"\n\n\"Just a bunch of murderous little altruists,\" Donald sneered. \"Out of\nthe kindness of your cold-blooded hearts--\"\n\n\"That's the trouble with you lower orders,\" I interrupted. \"You get\nemotional. Your observations have no basis in logic. Actually, the\nGalaxy wouldn't even quiver if the lot of you disappeared tomorrow. Yet\nyou think the universe rotates about your heads.\"\n\n\"I didn't--\"\n\n\"Don't interrupt,\" I snapped. \"You--your race--your whole pitiful\nlittle civilization is ready mentally and almost ready technologically\nto commit suicide. If we came and saved you, you would owe us eternal\ngratitude, but I doubt if we'd get it.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't,\" Donald assured me. \"There wouldn't be a human alive who\nwouldn't hate you.\"\n\n\"I realize that--and that is one of the reasons I should report your\nworld unfavorably to the council. We could hardly take on an altruism\nmission like this unless we felt that our work would be appreciated. It\nwould be better to let you kill yourselves.\"\n\n\"Altruism!\"\n\n\"In a sense. At least your race would be the greater gainers. All we'd\nget would be your excess population.\"\n\n\"And what would you want them for--slaves?\"\n\n\"Authority, no!\" I said, shocked in spite of myself. \"We'd merely\nprocess them for food.\"\n\nHe was silent after that.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDonald was away again, at a publisher's meeting. Our new book laid\nin Restoration England was going to be an even greater success than\nthe first if the advance notices were any criterion. Edith was at a\nstudio party celebrating the completion of the picture in which she was\nworking. And Ven was bored.\n\nFor awhile she sat in on Donald's conference in a city called New York,\nbut that proved to be uninteresting. I was busy with a faulty fuel feed\nin the drive chamber. The sun was hot, and the day was promising to be\nextremely warm even though it was not yet noon. It was one of those\ndays when nothing happens, and I was grateful for it. I had had enough\nof emotional tangles to last me for some time. It was almost soothing\nto work with the robots on insensate machinery rather than supervise a\npair of highly charged mammals and a hardly less unstable mate.\n\nThe association with these entities hadn't done Ven a great deal\nof good. In fact, I could notice a deterioration of her character\nthat bothered me. She no longer looked at me with respect. Indeed,\nher yellow eyes at times held a pitying amusement that I should be\nso weak as to argue with Donald. I didn't bother to point out that\nthe three tons of power metal had virtually all been brought aboard\nthrough Donald's efforts, and that our conveniences, our defenses, our\nrobots and our very lives were due to the working arrangements I had\nestablished.\n\nThe only useful thing Edith had done in the past month was to help me\nchange the tube liners in the steering jets. Her size and strength had\nmade the job easy--and it was normally a hard one, since the robots\ndidn't have the flexibility or balance that Edith, with her dancer's\nbody, possessed. The job had taken two days. It would have taken better\nthan a week if I had to use robots.\n\nThe mammals, I thought, would be of distinct value as members of\nspaceport maintenance crews. Their combination of immense strength\nand high intelligence would be useful to our society. I made a note\nof it and added it to the data I was assembling for the Council. It\nwas foolish, perhaps, but I couldn't help feeling an interest in these\ncreatures.\n\nI looked across the little valley that was our domain. It was an\nidyllic life we were leading. Unhurried--peaceful--the sort of life I\nthoroughly enjoyed. It would have been perfect if it wasn't for the\ninsane and dangerous world on which it was being lived.\n\nOf course it was too good to last. Idylls invariably are. The peace\nof ours was shattered abruptly when Ven came into the drive room and\ndisturbed my work. Her aura blazed a rich violet.\n\n\"Eu,\" she said. \"Come up to the control room. Something's wrong!\"\n\n\"What,\" I asked.\n\n\"It's Edith. I can't do a thing with her.\"\n\n\"You're not supposed to. She's working now.\"\n\n\"She is not! Her studio has finished the picture and they're having a\nparty.\"\n\n\"That's nice. I hope you're letting her have a good time.\"\n\n\"I told her to. But I never imagined what they'd be doing!\" Ven's voice\nwas anguished.\n\n\"Well, what _are_ they doing?\"\n\n\"Ingesting ethanol to excess!\"\n\n\"Ethanol!\" I gasped. \"Oh no!\"\n\nI hadn't realized that normal mammals consumed excess amounts of the\nstuff, although there were references to it in the literature. I\nthought that was merely literary exaggeration. After all, we had been\nhere scarcely half a year, and we hadn't really learned too much about\nthe details of mammalian society. Donald's kidneys had forced him to\nlead a quiet life, and the passing of Edith from his control to Ven's\nhad caused no remarkable alterations in her doings.\n\nI should have paid more attention to their customs. But I had been\ntoo busy. I swore as I reached for my control helmet. I'd have to stop\nthis before it became serious. Donald would be of no help to me. He was\nseveral thousand vursts away, and even under the best circumstances\ncouldn't be expected back for a day.\n\nI didn't bother to call him, but instead adjusted the controls to\nEdith's setting.\n\n\nVI\n\nA horde of gaily dressed mammals surrounded me, their faces and bodies\noddly fuzzy and distorted. Edith's voice was equally fuzzy. There was\nsomething wrong with her centers. I tapped the helmet and checked the\ncontroller just in case it was on our end, but they were functioning\nperfectly. There was nothing wrong--merely the fact that ethanol was\ndisturbing the biocircuits I had implanted in her brain. I swore a\nfew choice expletives of Low Thalassan and tried to get through by\nincreasing the power. It did no good.\n\n\"I c'n still feel that li'l lizard in m' head,\" Edith announced. \"Gimme\nanother drink. I wanna wash her out. Darn li'l lizard makes me do\nthings I dowanna do. It wants me to quit, but I wanna get drunk.\"\n\n\"Take it easy,\" a fuzzy male face said. \"You're loaded. Why does a\nnice chick like you hafta be loaded? Whyncha get outa here? I gotta\nnice place over in Santa Monica where--\"\n\nThe face disappeared.\n\n\"Hey! Alice! Golly, I almos' din't reckanize you. Howya doin?\"\n\n\"Better than you, Edith. You're drunk. And from the looks of you,\nyou're going to be sick if you don't get some fresh air.\"\n\n\"Gotta go spit in the eye of my li'l lizard,\" Edith said. \"Y'wanna\ncome with me? I got Don's car. We c'n get outa here an' get some fresh\nair--an' I c'n tell that li'l lizard what I think of her.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"You wanna see my li'l lizard. She's got yella eyes, and a li'l tail,\nand she turns all kindsa colors, and she lives in a rock with a door\nin it, an she makes me do things I dowanna do. It ain't so bad though.\nMosta the time I like it. Not alla time though. That's why I wanna spit\nin her eye. She c'n tell me all she wants--but she's gotta leave me'n\nDon alone. I love that guy.\" Edith started sobbing--why, I couldn't\nunderstand.\n\n\"She's maudlin,\" I said to Ven. \"No one's going to believe a thing she\nis saying. But this should be a warning to us. We'll have to put in\na block against drinking ethanol. I didn't realize how badly it can\naffect the biocircuits.\" I handed the helmet back to Ven. \"You can\nwatch this mess if you want to. I'm going to our quarters.\"\n\nI slipped out of the control chair and walked across the room.\n\nI was stronger now, more accustomed to the gravity, and it didn't\nbother me unless I had to stand for long periods of time. I turned in\nthe doorway to look at Ven. She had the helmet on again and her aura\nwas a crackling red. I shook my head. Edith was due for a bad time when\nthe effects of that hydrocarbon wore off.\n\nI had hardly fallen into light estivation when Ven's projection crashed\nthrough my antennae.\n\n\"Eu! Get up! Come here quickly!\"\n\nWith a groan I came slowly back to full facility and ran to the control\nroom. Ven's face was filled with panic.\n\n\"They're coming up here,\" she said. \"A whole carful of them!\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Edith's drunken friends! Somehow she's collected six of them and\nthey're driving up here to spit in my eye!\"\n\nDespite myself, I laughed. Ven looked so outraged I couldn't help it.\n\n\"We can close the airlock,\" I said, \"and they can't tell us from a\nrock.\"\n\n\"I won't! I'm going to teach that girl a lesson she won't forget in a\nhurry! I've listened to myself being insulted for two hours--and she's\nstill going strong. When she gets up here I'll show her whose eye\nshe'll spit in!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nVen was raging. I'd never seen her so emotional before. Her aura\nswelled and ebbed in ruddy shades as her breath came and went in short\ngasps.\n\n\"And how do you propose to do that?\" I asked.\n\n\"I'll stat her!\" Ven raged. \"I'll stat every one of them!\"\n\nI blinked. \"I wouldn't do that,\" I said mildly. \"What can we do with\nthem? The two we have are bad enough. And if you stat them, we'll have\nto kill or condition them. We couldn't let them go home with a story\nlike the one they'd tell.\"\n\n\"I don't care,\" Ven said. \"You can do what you like about the rest\nof them, but that Edith is going to learn a lesson.\" She was being\nemotional and quite unwilling to listen to reason--and she was larger\nand stronger than I. Despite my protests, she jerked a stat projector\nfrom the rack and strode toward the open airlock.\n\n\"Thalassa!\" she exclaimed. \"They're coming through the gate! They'll be\nhere in a minute.\"\n\nI could hear the roar of a protesting engine groaning up the trail to\nthe lower meadow as I hurried after Ven. As I reached the airlock, the\ngray body of Donald's station wagon poked its nose around the trees\nbelow our ship.\n\nVen stood rigidly in the airlock, waiting, her lips tight and her eyes\nnarrow. She took a firmer grip on the stat as the car stopped and the\ngiggling, half-sober humans tumbled out. I was in a quandary. I didn't\nwant Ven to shoot, but I couldn't close the airlock with her inside it.\nSo I stood, hesitating while the group of gaily dressed mammals came\ntoward us through the trees, their high voices loud in the stillness.\n\n\"Gotta find that li'l lizard an tell her to stop meddling with my\nlife,\" Edith's voice came to my ears.\n\nVen stiffened beside me as the group broke out of the trees in front of\nthe ship.\n\n\"Why, Edie, it's beautiful!\" a voice said. \"It's a fairy glen! No\nwonder you'd never tell us where you got that suntan! And that big\nrock--it's just like you said--And--uh!\" The voice never finished as\nVen pressed the trigger.\n\nI looked down at the six crumpled mammalian bodies and the lone\nstanding figure that looked stupidly up at us.\n\n\"Well,\" I said. \"You've done it this time. Now are you satisfied?\n\n\"No,\" Ven said. \"Not half.\" Her voice was tight with anger. She looked\ndown at Edith. \"Come here!\" she said.\n\n\"Dowanna,\" Edith replied uncertainly. \"You've made Don leave me. I\ndon't like you.\" But habit was stronger than alcohol and under the\nfurious lash of Ven's voice she came unsteadily forward.\n\n\"Do you understand me, you little sarf!\" Ven snapped icily. \"I said\n_come here_!\" She took the control box from her waist and viciously\ntwisted the intensity dial to maximum. At this range its force was\nirresistible, even with alcohol-deadened synapses. Edith shuddered and\nmoved toward us, her hands clumsily tearing at the fabric that covered\nher.\n\n\"I'm comin'! You don' hafta shout. I ain't deaf. I ain't done nothin'!\"\nShe sat down beside the airlock and struggled out of her clothing,\nripping the thin fabric under the last of Ven's anger until she was\ncompletely naked. Then she stood up and reached her hands toward Ven.\n\n\"You're not going to try to ride her while she's in that condition?\" I\nsaid.\n\n\"This is my affair,\" Ven replied grimly. \"I'm going to get this\nsettled.\"\n\nI shrugged.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was no sense reasoning with her while she was in that mood. And\nif she wanted to kill herself that was her concern. I watched her drop\nonto Edith's shoulders, wind one hand viciously into the mammal's long\nblonde hair and guide the gross body into a shambling walk toward the\nmeadow. Edith swayed dangerously, but somehow she managed to stay on\nher feet as they disappeared into the trees.\n\nI walked over to the six bodies, gave each of them a light stat to make\nsure they would remain quiet and sat down beside the nearest one to\nthink.\n\nVen's anger had left me a sizeable problem. What on earth could I do\nwith six human females? I needed them like I needed a broken digit.\nTime passed and the sun rose toward the zenith, and finally I came to a\ndecision. Since we had them on our hands, we might as well make use of\nthem. Killing would be too dangerous.\n\nAnd presently Edith came through the trees, a sick, tired, sober Edith\nwhose face was dirty and tear streaked, carrying a grim Ven whose aura\nsmoldered a reddish brown.\n\n\"What did you do to her?\" I asked.\n\n\"None of your business,\" Ven snapped. \"She's all right now. Aren't you,\nEdith?\"\n\n\"Yes, Ven--and I won't do it again. Honest I won't.\"\n\n\"You'd better not,\" Ven said grimly. \"Now I suppose we have some work\nto do.\"\n\n\"You certainly have,\" I said. \"If it wasn't for your temper we wouldn't\nhave this mess on our hands. Now get moving! Have Edith carry these\ngirls to the ship.\" I gestured at the prone bodies. \"And you, get\ninside and bring out the control equipment and connect the leads to the\ncomputer.\" I was angry, too. Under the force of my superior will, the\ntwo females scurried to obey. \"I'm disgusted with you, Ven,\" I said\nangrily. \"Just because your pet went to a party, you don't have to act\nchildish. Did you expect she'd behave like a Thalassan?\"\n\n\"I trusted her,\" Ven said.\n\n\"It just goes to show that you can't trust an animal too far,\" I said.\n\"Now get moving. Bring the probes first. We have a lot of work to do\nbefore evening.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was finished sooner than I expected. The sun was still in the\nsky, but close to the edge of the hills. The row of mammalian bodies\nslumbered peacefully beside the airlock. Ven looked down at them\nspeculatively.\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"You have one, and that's enough.\"\n\n\"But,\" Ven said.\n\n\"I've humored you,\" I said. \"I've let you act like a lower order. Now\nI want to see you behave like a civilized being. For unless you do, I\nshall have to take steps. I'm tired of this childishness.\"\n\n\"I'll be all right now,\" Ven replied. \"We've come to an understanding.\"\nShe gestured at Edith with her primary digit and the big mammal\nshivered. I wondered what Ven had done to her. Edith was thoroughly\ncowed--actually afraid of little Ven, who was less than one fifth her\nsize. In a way, I felt an odd sort of pride in my mate that she should\nachieve mastery over such an intelligent and potentially dangerous\nbrute. I knew perfectly well that I'd never dare attempt such dominance\nover Donald unless I was prepared to rob him of the mentality that made\nhim useful. But I consoled myself with the thought that this female was\npeculiarly susceptible to domination.\n\n\"We'd better get that car out of sight,\" Ven said. She nodded to Edith.\nThe human obediently trotted off in the direction of the car. A few\nmoments later the sound of the motor rose and fell as she concealed it\nin the trees.\n\nAs soon as I could, I contacted Donald and told him what had happened.\nFortunately he was alone, so his exclamation of surprise and\nconsternation didn't arouse any suspicion.\n\n\"Ethanol, eh?\" he said speculatively.\n\nIt was easy to follow the trend of his thoughts. \"Don't get any ideas,\"\nI warned in my best TV villain manner. \"I have Edith up here with me.\nIf you want to see her again, you'd better stay sober.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't think of crossing you,\" he assured me insincerely. \"I'm too\nclose to being rid of you.\"\n\n\"Well--what do we do?\" I asked. \"You're the expert on this insane\nsociety of yours.\"\n\n\"You've done it,\" he said. \"I don't think it was smart of you, but\nunder the circumstances, I can't see how you could have done anything\nelse. I warned you about Ven and Edith,\" he added--rather gloatingly, I\nthought. \"Now you're in for it.\" His voice was almost gay.\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Six women vanishing all at once is going to cause a stir even in Los\nAngeles,\" he said.\n\n\"After an ethanol party?\" I asked curiously. \"Six dancers out of a\nproduction that used a hundred? Your city will never miss them.\"\n\n\"But their families will.\"\n\nFamilies! I hadn't thought of that. Mammals had strong family\nties--probably due to their method of reproduction. We Thalassans,\ncoming as we did from eggs, had none of this. The state incubators and\nthe creches were our only contact with parenthood. We had no families.\n\"Hmm,\" I said. \"I hadn't thought of that.\"\n\n\"Well, you'd better start. I hope it gives you a headache.\"\n\n\"You get nastier every time I talk with you,\" I complained.\n\n\"I have my reasons,\" he said bitterly. \"Now, if you're through with\nme, little master, I think I'd like to get some sleep. In the meantime\nyou'd better get them back to their homes before they're missed.\"\n\n\"I can't,\" I confessed. \"The controller isn't big enough to handle\neight of you--not as individuals.\"\n\nDonald chuckled grimly. \"That's your worry. Remember, unless you find\nout which of them will be missed and act accordingly, you're going to\nbe very much in the public eye.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI didn't feel too happy as I cut off, but Donald had given me an idea.\n\nOne by one I checked the new proxies. Of the six, two were living\ntogether. They had the casual emotional involvement with males so\ncharacteristic of this species, but they could remain here for several\ndays without causing comment. Of the remaining four, one had a\nroommate and would be difficult to extract; another was living alone;\nstill another was mated and had an offspring, but she was not living\nwith her mate--a legal action having separated her much as it separates\nincompatible Thalassans. The offspring, however, was living with her\nwhen she wasn't working, a not unusual situation on this world, but one\nwhich could have some complications unless she was returned to it very\nshortly.\n\nThe last was living with her parents and was seriously involved\nemotionally with a male. She was planning to be officially mated\nin the near future, although it would be legal fiction rather than\nfact since she was already nurturing a living embryo of some three\nweeks development. I debated whether to remove it, a simple enough\nmanipulation, but decided against it. It would be interesting to\nobserve a mammalian reproduction. But to remove her from her family and\nher unofficial mate was a task that might be difficult. I needed help.\n\nI projected a call for Ven, phrasing it imperatively so she could have\nno doubt about its urgency. Her answer was quick and clear.\n\n\"I'm coming,\" she said.\n\n\"Good. I need you. And bring Edith. We have a problem that will require\nher talents.\"\n\n\"She'll be happy to cooperate.\" Ven's projection was cheerfully\nconfident.\n\n\"You did her no permanent damage, I hope.\"\n\n\"Not a bit. In fact, you'd never know she's been disciplined.\"\n\n\"Well, get in here, both of you. We have work to do.\"\n\nEdith had trouble squeezing into the control room and, despite her skin\nconditioning, the place quickly filled with her scent. But Ven and\nI were old hands now and took it in stride. She grasped the problem\ninstantly. \"The only one who might be any trouble is Alice. Her family\nand her boy friend can be difficult. The others won't need much effort,\nexcept for Grace. She'd better be returned to her baby as soon as\npossible.\"\n\n\"How soon?\" I asked.\n\n\"The baby isn't living with her,\" Edith added, \"not while she's\nworking, but she sees it regularly. Every day or two, I believe.\"\n\nI sighed. That solved the biggest problem.\n\n\"We had better start at once,\" Ven said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI ignored her and looked inquiringly at Edith. \"What would you do?\" I\nasked, flashing a cold projection at Ven to stay out of this.\n\n\"Well--if I had to do it, I'd send Alice and Grace home. I wouldn't do\nanything to Alice except block her from talking about this place and\nwhat happened. Grace I'd put under full control, have her pick up her\nbaby, go home and pack to leave. As soon as she's ready to go, bring\nher out here.\"\n\n\"The infant, too?\"\n\n\"Of course. A baby's no bother.\"\n\nThis, I thought, was something of an understatement.\n\n\"And what of the others?\" I asked.\n\n\"Velma has a nosey roommate. Have her start a fight and leave angry.\nShe hasn't much baggage, and it won't be any trouble for her to\ncollect it. As for the other three, I think Joan's being kept. She\ncan't afford a single apartment on her salary. Loleta and Marian are\nalways out, sometimes for days. Their landlady won't think a thing of\nit. If they never return, she'll just pack their things and rent the\nroom to someone else. I know that old witch. I'd just keep those three\nhere and not worry about them. Nobody's going to make any fuss about\nthree chorines disappearing. Later on you can make them write letters\nenclosing money to send their clothes to another city. Then they can\nbe picked up and stored. That should give us a year before anyone gets\nsuspicious enough to look for them.\"\n\n\"Edith,\" I said, \"you're a genius.\"\n\n\"I got you into this mess,\" Edith said. \"So, perhaps I'd better get you\nout.\"\n\n\"But your fellow mammals--\"\n\n\"You haven't hurt me--not much, anyway,\" Edith said. \"So I don't\nsuppose you'll hurt them. And, besides, I don't want Ven mad at me like\nshe was this afternoon. Anyway--you'll be gone soon.\"\n\n\"I think I shall regret leaving,\" I said honestly. \"There is a great\ndeal about you mammals I am beginning to suspect I do not know.\"\n\n\"You aren't kidding,\" she said with faint bitterness so similar to\nDonald's that my antennae quivered. \"But it's been quite an experience.\nI'll tell my kids when I have them--but they're not going to believe\nme.\"\n\n\"I hope you have those children--and raise them to maturity,\" I said.\n\nThe tone of my voice caused her to look at me with sudden fear on her\nface. But at the sight of my impassive features it died away. \"You\nscared me for a moment,\" she said.\n\n\"Did I? I didn't mean to.\"\n\n\nVII\n\nThe next week kept us busy following Edith's instructions. I didn't see\nhow they would apply to Alice, but Edith knew her species better than\nI. Alice's silence and the prying inquisitiveness of her parents and\nher boyfriend worked like magic. Alice finally became angry and after\na stormy scene left the house, swearing never to return. Edith picked\nher up as she walked away; Ven turned on the control and turned the\nthreat to fact. Later I took a leaf from Edith's book and sent Alice to\nSan Francisco, where I had her write a pair of bitter letters to her\nparents and her extralegal mate. After that I felt more secure.\n\nThe others worked out exactly as Edith predicted. No trouble at all.\nBy the time Donald returned from the East with a ton of tin ingots in\na small truck our training schedule was well set up. The robots and I\nhad managed to build a multiplex controller similar to those we used\non Thalassa on the state farms, but much smaller. It could handle the\nproxies en masse or as individuals. While far less sensitive than the\none in the ship, it was effective enough for our rather elementary\npurposes.\n\nEdith, who was running the group under Ven's supervision, had them\nlined up in a row to greet Donald as he came up the hill toward the\nship.\n\n\"The place looks like a nudist colony,\" Donald grumbled. \"You haven't\nimproved it any.\" He eyed the file of mammals trooping down to the\ntruck to unload the tin ingots. \"I have another ton lined up for\ndelivery as soon as you get this processed,\" he said.\n\n\"Good,\" I replied. \"We'll leave as soon as it's aboard. I don't like\nthe looks of your recent actions.\"\n\n\"Mine?\" I shook my head. \"Oh, you mean the world situation.\" I nodded.\n\"You shouldn't worry about it. You should have seen it this time last\nyear.\"\n\nI shrugged. I would never really understand these creatures. Their\nbrains functioned differently. \"You frighten me with your wild displays\nof emotion. Someday one of you is going to start something and your\nworld is going to go up in fire.\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" he said. \"I have some ideas about that. With the\nmoney from your stories and with what you have taught me, I think there\nwill be some changes.\" There was a peculiar expression in his eyes that\nI couldn't identify. It made me vaguely uneasy. \"I've been doing a lot\nof thinking since you met up with Edie and me. What this world needs\nis someone who can run it.\"\n\n\"That's obvious,\" I said. \"Until your society catches up with your\ntechnology you will be in constant danger. You mammals will have to\nlearn to discipline your emotions.\"\n\nHis face twisted. \"I've had a good practical course in that,\" he said.\n\"Now I'm getting post-graduate training.\" He gestured at the women\ncoming up the hill carrying the silver tin ingots. \"Just how long do\nyou think I can endure something like this?\"\n\n\"Like what?\" I asked.\n\n\"Do I have to draw you a diagram?\" he asked. \"Ever since you lizards\ncame into my life I haven't been able to touch a woman. Not even\nEdith--and she's my wife. Just how much of this do you think I can\ntake?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Oh!\" I exclaimed with dawning comprehension. \"I think I see.\"\n\nThe situation would have been amusing if it wasn't so stupid. I was\nsurprised that I hadn't realized it before. There was, I knew, a\ncertain amount of feedback in a bipolar control circuit. Obviously\nenough of Ven's conditioning, and mine, had seeped through to affect\nDonald and Edith's normal relationships. Mammals were far more\npreoccupied with sex than we were. Their books, magazines, television\nand motion pictures reeked of it. It was present in almost every piece\nof advertising, and four of our six new proxies were living histories\nof it. Yet Donald and Edith, because of our feedback, had been kept as\ncontinent as novitiates for the priesthood of Authority!\n\n\"I'm a perfectly normal male,\" Donald said. \"Just what do you think\nyou've been doing to me? I can't drink. I can't make love. I can't do\nanything except collect tin for you lizards. Just why do you think I\nhate you? Now you surround me with a whole damned untouchable harem!\nAre you trying to drive me insane?\"\n\nI laughed, and Donald recognize the sound for what it was.\n\n\"Oh, _damn_ you!\" he said bitterly. \"How would you like to be married\nfor eight months and for six of them be unable to touch your wife? Just\nwhy do you think Edith tried to get drunk? I could kill you cheerfully\nfor what you've done to us!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" I said. There was a world of understanding opening in front\nof me. Of course, it would do no good to tell him that Ven and I\nhad remained in enforced continence for five years. It was just the\nEugenics council working through us--entirely involuntarily. What\nwas bothering Donald and Edith was so absurdly simple that neither\nVen nor I would have thought to ask. And the mammals with their\npeculiar customs and habits would never have told us unless--as had\nhappened--the pressure became too great.\n\nWhat our mammals needed was a good dose of Va Krul's basic therapy. If\nEdith were fertilized as a result of it, so much the better. It would\nkeep her attention where it more properly belonged. The thought would\nnever have occurred to me in my present state. Since I was content, I\nhad erroneously assumed that everything was in harmony.\n\n\"You might as well go home,\" I said. \"Take Edith with you. We won't\nneed you for several days.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"You'll find things a little different. I'll make a few adjustments on\nthe controller.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo my surprise Don didn't appear happy at all. \"Does that mean what I\nthink it does?\" he demanded. \"Do you think I'll get any satisfaction\nout of being controlled _even there_?\"\n\n\"I don't know about the pleasure,\" I said coldly, \"but I do know that\nit will improve your attitude.\"\n\nDonald raged at me, his brain white with anger. \"So help me God, Eu\nKor, someday I'm going to kill you for this! It's the ultimate insult.\"\n\n\"You're not going to do anything,\" I said calmly. His voice dissolved\ninto obscenity. For a moment I felt sorry for him until I remembered\nthe basic truth that none of us are free--and the most intelligent,\nnaturally, are the least free of all. They are bound by their\ncommitments, their duties, their responsibilities, and by their\nintelligence itself. If a superior intelligence occasionally exhibits\npetty lapses--which amuse him or relieve his boredom--it is not the\nplace of the less endowed to construe it as a sign of equality.\n\nSome--like Ven and me--have known their place from birth. Others, like\nEdith and Alice, learn easily with a minimum amount of pain. Some like\nGrace learn hard; and some--like Donald--do not learn at all.\n\nDonald was the eternal rebel, complying because he must, yet seething\nwith resentment because he did. He was the personification of drive\nwithout innate control, ambition without humility, intelligence without\nwisdom. As he had been, he was not quite enough. At best he would have\nbeen a minor author and a petty domestic tyrant. He would never have\nbeen a threat simply because he didn't have the ability or training.\nBut I had given him what he lacked. The knowledge I had impressed upon\nhis mind would give him a tremendous advantage over his fellow mammals,\nand his tendencies toward domestic tyranny would expand to include\nothers. His glandular attitude would pervert his knowledge to the\ndetriment of humankind. He could become a thing so dangerous that it\ncould destroy this precariously balanced world.\n\nI went into the ship and set up a world matrix on the computer, using\nall the data I had accumulated, secured the answer, and then inserted\nDonald's potential into the matrix. I then ordered a probability\nextrapolation for both matrices, equating the solutions with survival.\n\nThe answers confirmed my thoughts. With the matrix as it stood, the\ntwenty year survival prediction was 65 per cent, which wasn't too bad\nsince few advanced-technology worlds have better than an 85 per cent\nsurvival probability. But with Donald in the matrix, the survival\nprediction was zero!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI knew what I must do. I could not leave him behind as I had planned.\nNor could I inflict the senseless cruelty of brainblotting. He would\nhave to be mercifully destroyed.\n\nAlthough I was fond of Donald, and his death would leave me sick for\nweeks, it would not be right to let my creation live and condemn the\nmammal race to death. I could not exterminate a race Authority had\ncreated. The guilt syndrome would be shattering. Of course, if they\nkilled each other that was not my concern.\n\nBut until we left I would give him all the freedom he could use.\nOutside of the minimum of control, he would be free to do and act as\nhe pleased. I didn't owe it to him, yet it was not his fault that he\nhad come into my hands. And when I returned to Thalassa I would tell\nthe Council what I had done and ask for justice. Perhaps we could save\nthis world from itself even as we had saved others. The question of\ngratitude would be immaterial.\n\nWith a firm hand to set them on the track, the mammals might learn the\nvalues of intelligence and cooperation before it was too late. They\nmight understand the realities of existence rather than fall victim to\ntheir glandular fancies. They might. But if they did, one thing would\nbe certain--they would learn it the hard way. Donald was proof of that.\n\nI went to our living quarters, and presently Ven joined me. \"They're\nall in for the night, Eu,\" she said.\n\n\"That's good. How are they coming along?\"\n\n\"Splendidly. Another week should see the end of the training. Edith was\na good experience for me in handling these. I'm not making the mistakes\nI did. I'm finding the blocks and removing them. One of them, the one\ncalled Grace, should be even better than Edith.\"\n\n\"As a mount?\" I asked with faint humor. \"Or as a working proxy?\"\n\n\"Both,\" Ven said promptly. \"She's stronger and more intelligent. Yet\neven so I think I shall always like Edith best.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"One's first dependent is always one's fondest memory,\" I replied\nsententiously, \"But you'll forget them all when we're back on Thalassa.\"\n\n\"I won't,\" Ven said. \"I'll never forget Edith.\"\n\n\"Never is a long time,\" I said gently. \"I shall even forget the pain of\nkilling Donald some day.\"\n\n\"Then you've decided to eliminate him?\" Ven said.\n\nI nodded. \"It's necessary,\" I said. \"This world wouldn't be safe with\nhim alive.\"\n\n\"Poor Edith. She's fond of the brute,\" Ven said. She moved toward the\ndoorway.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" I asked.\n\n\"I want to talk to Edith. Perhaps I can prepare her.\"\n\n\"No. Don't,\" I said. \"Contact her if you wish, but tell her nothing.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" she said. I smiled as she disappeared. Ven was going to\nmiss her pet once we had left. It was obvious.\n\n\"Eu! Quick!\" Ven's projection crackled in my brain. \"They're fighting!\nEdith's being hurt, and I can't touch them! They've set up a block!\"\n\nI ran for the control room, slapped the helmet on my head, reached for\nthe controls--and stopped, laughing.\n\n\"Stop them!\" Ven screamed. Her aura blazed a brilliant white and her\nprojection nearly knocked me down. She reached for the control switch,\nbut I slapped her hand away.\n\n\"Quiet!\" I snapped. \"They're not fighting, you little fool! Turn on\nyour audio and listen and stop acting silly!\"\n\nVen did as I told her and her aura changed to a fiery pink. \"Oh!\" she\nsaid in a small voice, \"but they never--\"\n\nI must have made some mistake in revising the controllers--or feedback\nwas stronger than I suspected--for the Va Krul syndrome came back\nalong our lines of contact with explosive force! Desperately I reached\nfor the switch--but my hand froze in midair as an intolerable wave\nof emotion drove Ven and me together like two pieces of iron with\nopposite magnetic charge! The last thing I remember was being enveloped\nin the flaring golden glow of Ven's aura.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI came to my senses in our living quarters. I was\nstunned--exhausted--limp and gasping.\n\n\"Thalassa!\" I said weakly, \"we've _really_ done it now!\"\n\nVen smiled a pale blue radiance at me. \"You have become strong, living\non this heavy world,\" she said. \"I like it.\"\n\n\"But--but!\" I sputtered. \"It was so--it can't--it couldn't--\"\n\n\"But it did,\" Ven said softly. \"And I'm glad it did.\"\n\n\"I don't mean that. What I mean to say was that it was so--\"\n\n\"Unexpected?\"\n\n\"No! So utterly--\"\n\n\"Satisfying?\" she asked.\n\n\"Stop interrupting! It was all of that and more. But what I want to say\nis that we've violated the prime restriction for space travellers. How\ncould we do it?\"\n\n\"You're forgetting that for some time we have been living upon this\nemotion-charged world,\" Ven said. \"The steady erosion was more than our\nconditioning could take. The feedback was merely the last in a whole\nseries of disruptive stimuli. It was the trigger, but our defenses had\nbeen weakened long before. Not that I'm sorry,\" she added quickly.\n\"For weeks I've been wondering what sort of a mate you'd be when this\ntrip was over. I'm not unhappy with the preview.\" She smiled at me and\nthe whole of our living quarters was filled with a bright tender blue.\n\n\"The natives,\" I said worriedly. \"We were in contact with them.\"\n\nVen's aura darkened. \"I had forgotten them,\" she said. \"I hope that the\nfeedback wasn't intensified and returned to them. I'd better look.\" She\nstarted for the control room and I followed more slowly.\n\n\"There's no damage,\" she said from beneath the helmet. \"Edith feels\njust as I do.\"\n\nI took my helmet and coded Don's pattern on the selector. Peculiar, I\nthought with vague wonder. Most peculiar. For the first time Donald and\nI were in true rapport. His mind was slow, lazy, sluggish--even his\nambition was sated for the moment. Could it be, I wondered, that we\ncould find agreement through our _emotions_? Was it frustration that\ndrove him? Whatever the block had been it was gone now. This was a\ntrue empathic meeting--something far more satisfying than our previous\nconflict.\n\nI relaxed in it, feeling the slow langorous questings of his mind even\nas he felt mine. There was a sense of brotherhood that transcended\ndifferences in race and culture. We were down to basics, on the oldest\nmeeting ground of life.\n\nHe was wondering idly what the outcome of this might be--conscious of\nme, but careless. It jolted me. He might be uncertain, but I _knew_ Ven\nwas from good family stock, and \"good\" to a Thalassan meant something\nentirely different than it commonly did to the natives of this planet!\n\nI disengaged hurriedly and shook Ven out of her rapport with Edith.\n\"We've no time to lose,\" I said. \"We must leave at once! You know\nwhat's going to happen!\"\n\n\"I know,\" Ven said. \"I feel the changes already.\"\n\n\"That's just in your mind,\" I snapped.\n\n\"We're not going home,\" she said. There was a note of prophecy in her\nvoice. \"We'll never make it.\"\n\n\"We can't stay here!\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"Then what are we going to do?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe couldn't stay here. But we couldn't go home either. The trip would\ntake weeks, and hyperspace is fatal to a gravid Thalassan female.\nThat was something we learned long ago, and the principal reason for\ncontinence-conditioning for couples in space. What was more, I knew\nthat where Ven stayed, I would stay.\n\n\"Remember the fourth planet of this system?\" Ven asked.\n\n\"Yes. Ideal gravity, adequate oxygen, but too cold.\"\n\n\"And with no intelligent life,\" Ven added. \"That's an advantage--and\nwe can beat the cold. It wouldn't be too hard to build domes. We have\nplenty of power metal, and a matricizer. We could hatch our clutch\nthere. With the mammals to help us, we should be able to make a\ncomfortable enough life for the forty years it'll take to bring our\noffspring to maturity. We should be able to do this easily, and still\nget home before we're strangers.\"\n\n\"Hmm,\" I said. \"It's possible. And we can use this world for a supply\nbase. But would you care to live on that cold barren planet?\"\n\n\"There are worse places,\" she said matter-of-factly. \"And we'd be close\nto everything we'd need.\"\n\nIt did have possibilities. And the mammals could be adapted. They were\na more advanced evolutionary form than we, but lower on the adaptive\nscale--nonspecialized--more so than any other intelligent race I had\nencountered.\n\nVen said, \"We would actually be doing their race a favor, if the\ncomputation of this world's future is correct. Some of them would still\nsurvive if this planet commits suicide. And if the prediction is wrong,\nwe would have done no harm. If they reach space, they'll merely find\nthat they've already arrived when they reach the fourth planet.\"\n\n\"Which might be something of a surprise to their explorers,\" I said\nwith a chuckle. \"All right. We'll play it your way.\"\n\nI was pretty sure how Donald would take this. He was going to be\nfurious, but after all one doesn't make a pet of a wolf and then turn\nit loose. It's too hard on the livestock. But I didn't think he'd be\ntoo unhappy. He'd be the principal human on Mars; and after we left\nhe'd be ruler of a world. And in the meantime he could be a domestic\ntyrant.\n\nIt was fortunate, I thought with a smile, that mammals were essentially\npolygamous. Donald would make some nasty comments about being a herd\nsire--but I didn't think his comments would be too sincere. After all,\nit's not every man that has a chance to become a founding father.\n\nI was still smiling as I turned the dials on the controller and flipped\nthe switch. Founding father--the title was as much mine as his!\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Founding Father, by J.F.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
