Zagat\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n[Sidenote: Trapped in the great dome, Darl valiantly defends Earth's\noutpost against the bird-man of Mars and his horde of pigmy henchmen.]\n\n\nDarl Thomas mopped the streams of perspiration from his bronzed face\nand lean-flanked, wiry body, nude save for clinging shorts and fiber\nsandals. \"By the whirling rings of Saturn,\" he growled as he gazed\ndisconsolately at his paper-strewn desk. \"I'd like to have those\ndirectors of ITA here on Mercury for just one Earth-month. I'll bet\nthey wouldn't be so particular about their quarterly reports after\nthey'd sweated a half-ton or so of fat off their greasy bellies.\n'Fuel consumption per man-hour.': Now what in blazes does that mean?\nHey, Jim!\" He swiveled his chair around to the serried bank of\ngauge-dials that was Jim Holcomb's especial charge, then sprang to his\nfeet with a startled, \"What's the matter?\"\n\nThe chunky, red-haired control-man was tugging at a lever, his muscles\nbulging on arms and back, his face white-drawn and tense. \"Look!\" he\ngrunted, and jerked a grim jaw at one of the dials. The long needle\nwas moving rapidly to the right. \"I can't hold the air pressure!\"\n\n\"Wow, what a leak!\" Darl started forward. \"How's it below, in the\nmine?\"\n\n\"Normal. It's the Dome air that's going!\"\n\n\"Shoot on the smoke and I'll spot the hole. Quick, man!\"\n\n\"Okay!\"\n\nThomas' long legs shot him out of the headquarters tent. Just beyond\nthe entrance flap was one of the two gyrocopters used for flying\nwithin the Dome. He leaped into the cockpit and drove home the\nstarter-piston. The flier buzzed straight up, shooting for the misted\nroof.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Earthman fought to steady his craft against the hurricane wind,\nwhile his gray eyes swept the three-mile circle of the vault's base.\nHe paled as he noted the fierce speed with which the white smoke-jets\nwere being torn from the pipe provided for just such emergencies. His\nglance followed the terrific rush of the vapor. Big as a man's head, a\nhole glared high up on the Dome's inner surface. Feathered wisps of\ntell-tale vapor whisked through it at blurring speed.\n\n\"God, but the air's going fast,\" Darl groaned. The accident he had\nfeared through all the months he had captained Earth's outpost on\nMercury had come at last. The Dome's shell was pierced! A half-mile\nhigh, a mile across its circling base, the great inverted bowl was all\nthat made it possible for man to defy the white hell of Mercury's\nsurface. Outside was an airless vacuum, a waste quivering under the\nheat of a sun thrice the size it appears from Earth. The silvered\nexterior of the hemisphere shot back the terrific blaze; its\nquartz-covered network of latticed steel inclosed the air that all\nbeings need to sustain life.\n\nDarl tugged desperately at the control-stick, thrust the throttle over\nfull measure. A little more of this swift outrush and the precious air\nwould be gone. He caught a glimpse of the Dome floor beneath him and\nthe shaft-door that gave entrance to the mine below. Down there, in\nunderground tunnels whose steel-armored end-walls continued the Dome's\nprotection below the surface, a horde of friendly Venusians were\nlaboring. If the leak were not stopped in a few minutes that shaft\ndoor would blow in, and the mine air would whisk through the hole in\nits turn. Only the Dome would remain, a vast, rounded sepulcher,\nhiding beneath its curve the dead bodies of three Earthmen and the\nsilent forms of their Venusian charges.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDarl's great chest labored as he strove to reach the danger spot.\nInvisible fingers seemed to be clamped about his throat. His eyes\nblurred. The gyrocopter was sluggish, dipped alarmingly when it should\nhave darted, arrow-like, to its mark. With clenched teeth, the\nTerrestrian forced the whirling lifting vanes to the limit of their\npower. They bit into the fast thinning air with a muffled whine,\nraised the ship by feet that should have been yards.\n\nBy sheer will he forced his oxygen-starved faculties to function, and\nrealized that he had reached the wall. He was drifting downward, the\nhole draining the Dome's air was five feet above him, beyond his\nreach. The driven vanes were powerless to stem the craft's fall.\n\nOne wing-tip scraped interlaced steel, a horizontal girder, part of\nthe vault's mighty skeleton. Darl crawled along the wing, dragging\nwith him a sheet of flexible quartzite. The metal foil sagged under\nhim and slanted downward, trying like some animate thing to rid itself\nof the unwonted burden. He clutched the beam, hung by one leg and one\narm as his craft slid out from beneath him. The void below dragged at\nhim. He put forth a last tremendous spurt of effort.\n\nTwo thousand feet below, Jim Holcomb, dizzy and gasping, manipulated\nthe controls frenziedly, his eyes fastened on the dropping\npressure-gauge. From somewhere outside the tent a dull thud sounded.\n\"Crashed! Darl's crashed! It's all over!\" Hope gone, only the instinct\nof duty held him to his post. But the gauge needle quivered, ceased\nits steady fall and began a slow rise. Jim stared uncomprehendingly at\nthe dial, then, as the fact seeped in, staggered to the entrance.\n\"That's better, a lot better,\" he exclaimed. \"But, damn it, what was\nthat crash?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe headquarters tent was at one edge of the circular plain. Jim's\nbleary eyes followed the springing arch of a vertical girder, up and\nup, to where it curved inward to the space ship landing lock that hung\nsuspended from the center of the vaulted roof. Within that bulge, at\nthe very apex, was the little conning-tower, with its peri-telescope,\nits arsenal of ray-guns and its huge beam-thrower that was the Dome's\nonly means of defense against an attack from space. Jim's gaze\nflickered down again, wandered across the brown plain, past the long\nrows of canvas barracks and the derrick-like shaft-head. Hard by the\nfurther wall a crumpled white heap lay huddled.\n\n\"My God! It was his plane!\" The burly Earthman sobbed as his ten-foot\nleaps carried him toward the wreck.\n\nDarl was his friend as well as Chief, and together they had served the\nInterplanetary Trading Association, ITA, for years, working and\nfighting together in the wilds of the outer worlds. A thought struck\nhim, even as he ran. \"What in th' name o' Jupiter's nine moons stopped\nth' leak?\" He glanced up, halted, his mouth open in amazement. \"Well,\nI'm a four-tailed, horn-headed Plutonian if there ain't th' boy\nhimself!\"\n\nFar up in the interlaced steel of the framework, so high that to his\nstaring comrade he seemed a naked doll, Darl stood outstretched on a\nlevel beam, his tiny arms holding a minute square against the wall.\nLucky it was that he was so tall and his arms so long. For the saving\nplate just lapped the upper rim of the hole, and stemmed the fierce\ncurrent by only a half-inch margin.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe throbbing atmosphere machine in the sub-surface engine-room was\nreplacing the lost air rapidly, and now the increasing pressure was\nstrong enough to hold the translucent sheet against the wall by its\nown force. Jim saw the extended arms drop away. The manikin waved down\nto him, then turned to the shell again, as if to examine the emergency\nrepair. For a moment Darl stood thus, then he was running along the\ngirder, was climbing, ape-like, along a latticed beam that curved up\nand in, to swing down and merge with the bulge of the air-lock's\nwall.\n\n\"Like a bloomin' monkey! Can't he wait till I get him down with th'\nspare plane?\"\n\nBut Darl wasn't thinking of coming down. Something he had seen through\nthe translucent repair sheet was sending him to the look-out tower\nwithin the air-lock. Hand over hand he swung, tiny above that vast\nimmensity of space. In his forehead a pulse still jumped as his heart\nhurried new oxygen to thirsty cells. He held his gaze steadily to the\nroof. A moment's vertigo, a grip missed by the sixteenth of an inch,\nthe slightest failure in the perfect team-play of eye and brain, and\nrippling muscle, and he would crash, a half mile beneath, against hard\nrock.\n\nAt last he reached the curving side of the landing lock. But the\nplatform at the manhole entrance jutted diagonally below him, fifteen\nfeet down and twelve along the bellying curve. Darl measured the angle\nwith a glance as he hung outstretched, then his body became a human\npendulum over the sheer void. Back and forth, back and forth he swung,\nthen, suddenly, his grasp loosened and a white arc flashed through the\nair.\n\nBreathless, Jim saw the far-off figure flick across the chasm toward\nthe jutting platform. He saw Darl strike its edge, bit his lip as his\nfriend teetered on the rim and swayed slowly outward. Then Darl found\nhis balance. An imperative gesture sent the watcher back to his post,\nhis sorrel-topped head shaking slowly in wonderment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDarl Thomas ran headlong up the staircase that spiralled through the\ndim cavern. \"No mistake about it,\" he muttered. \"I saw something\nmoving outside that hole. Two little leaks before, and now this big\none. There's something a lot off-color going on around here.\"\n\nQuickly he reached the little room at the summit. He flung the canvas\ncover from the peri-telescope screen. Tempered by filters as it was\nthe blaze of light from outside hit him like a physical blow. He\nadjusted the aperture and beat eagerly over the view-table.\n\nVacation jaunts and travel view-casts have made the moon's landscape\nfamiliar to all. Very similar was the scene Darl scanned, save that\nthe barren expanse, pitted and scarred like Luna's, glowed almost\nliquid under the beating flame of a giant sun that flared in a black\nsky. Soundless, airless, lifeless, the tumbled plain stretched to a\njagged horizon.\n\nThe Earthman depressed the instrument's eye, and the silvered outside\nof the Dome, aflame with intolerable light, swept on to the screen\ndisk. The great mirror seemed alive with radiant heat as it shot back\nthe sun's withering darts. The torrid temperature of the oven within,\nunendurable save to such veterans of the far planets as Darl and Jim\nHolcomb, was conveyed to it through the ground itself. The direct rays\nof the sun, nearer by fifty million miles than it is to Earth, would\nhave blasted them, unprotected, to flaked carbon in an eye-blink.\n\nAn exclamation burst from Darl. A half-inch from the Dome's blazing\narc, a hundred yards in actuality, the screen showed a black fleck,\nmoving across the waste! Darl quickly threw in the full-power lens,\nand the image leaped life-size across the table. The black fleck was\nthe shadow of a space-suited figure that lumbered slowly through the\nviscous, clinging footing. How came this living form, clad in gleaming\nsilver, out there in that blast-furnace heat? In one of the space\nsuit's claw-like hands a tube flashed greenly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDarl's hand shot out to the trigger of the beam-thrower. Aimed by the\ntelescope's adjustment, the ray that could disintegrate a giant space\nflier utterly flared out at his finger's pressure. Against the lambent\nbrown a spot glowed red where the beam struck. But, warned by some\nuncanny prescience, the trespasser leaped aside in the instant between\nThomas' thought and act. Before Darl could aim and fire again the foe\nhad dodged back and was protected by the curve of the Dome itself.\n\nTwo white spots showed on either side of Darl's nostrils. His mouth\nwas a thin white slit, his eyes gray marbles. Standing against the\nwall beside him was a space suit, mirror-surfaced and double-walled\nagainst the planet's heat. In a few moments he was encased within it,\nhad snatched a pocket ray-gun from the long rack, and was through the\ndoor to the auxiliary air-lock. The air soughed out in response to his\nswift thrust at a lever, a second door opened, and he was on the\noutside, reeling from the blast of that inferno of light and heat.\n\nFor a moment the Earthman was dazzled, despite the smoked quartz\neye-pieces in his helmet. Then, as his eyes grew used to the glare, he\nsaw, far below, the erect figure of the stranger. The man was standing\nstill, waiting. His immobility, the calm confidence with which he\nstood there, was insolently challenging. Darl's rage flared higher at\nthe sight.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nScorning the ladder that curved along the Dome to the ground, he threw\nhimself at the polished round side of the great hemisphere. With\nincreasing speed he slid downward, the gleaming surface breaking only\nslightly the velocity of his fall. On Earth this would have been\nsuicidal. Even here, where the pull of gravity was so much less, the\nfeat was insanely reckless. But the heat-softened ground, the strength\nof his metal suit, brought Darl safely through.\n\nHe whirled to meet the expected onslaught of the interloper. The green\ntube was aimed straight at him! The Earthman started to bring his own\nweapon up when something exploded in his brain. There was a moment of\nblackness; then he was again clear-minded. But he could not move--not\nso much as the tiny twist of his wrist that would have brought his own\nweapon into play.\n\nFrozen by this strange paralysis, Darl Thomas saw the giant figure\napproach. The apparition bent and slung him to its shoulder. Glowing\nwalls rose about him, dimmed. The Terrestrian knew that he was being\ncarried down into one of the myriad openings that honeycombed the\nterrain. The luminescence died; there was no longer light enough to\npenetrate to his helmet's darkened goggles.\n\nFrantic questions surged through the captured Earthman's mind. Who was\nhis captor? From where, and how, had he come to Mercury? Jim, Angus\nMcDermott, and himself were the only Terrestrians on the planet; of\nthat he was certain. Only one or two of the reptile-skinned Venusian\nlaborers had sufficient intelligence to manipulate a space suit, and\nthey were unquestionably loyal.\n\nThis individual was a giant who towered far above Darl's own six feet.\nThe Mercurian natives--he had seen them when ITA's expedition had\ncleaned out the burrows beneath the Dome and sealed them up--were\nmidgets, the tallest not more than two feet in height. Whatever he\nwas, why was the stranger trying to destroy the Dome? Apparently\nThomas himself was not to be killed offhand: the jolting journey was\ncontinuing interminably. With enforced patience the Earthman resigned\nhimself to wait for the next scene in this strange drama.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the headquarters tent Jim's usual grin was absent as he moved\nrestlessly among the switches and levers that concentrated control of\nall the Dome's complex machinery. \"Darl's been gone a devilish long\ntime,\" he muttered to himself. \"Here it's almost time for shifts to\nchange and he's not back yet.\"\n\nA bell clanged, somewhere up in the mass of cables that rose from the\ncontrol board. For the next ten minutes Holcomb had no time for worry\nas he rapidly manipulated the innumerable wheels and handles in accord\nwith the vari-colored lights that flickered on a huge ground-glass map\nof the sub-Mercurian passages. On the plain outside there was a vast\nrustling, a many-voiced twittering and squeaking that was not quite\nbird-like in tone. Through the opened tent-flap one could see the\nstream of Venusian workers, their work-period ended, pouring out of\nthe shaft-head and filing between the ordered ranks of others whose\nlabors were about to begin.\n\nThey were queer-looking specimens, these gentle, willing allies of the\nEarthmen. Their home planet is a place of ever-clouded skies and\nconstant torrential rains. And so the Venusians were amphibians,\nweb-footed, fish-faced, their skin a green covering of horny scales\nthat shed water and turned the sharp thorns of their native jungles.\nWhen intrepid explorers discovered in the mazes of Mercury's spongy\ninterior the _surta_ that was so badly needed as a base material for\nsynthetic food to supply Earth's famine-threatened population, it was\nto these loyal and amiable beings that ITA's engineers turned for\nworkers who could endure the stifling heat of the underground\nworkings.\n\nThe tent-flap was thrust aside, and a hawk-nosed Scot came sleepily\nin, to be enthusiastically greeted by Jim.\n\n\"Hello, you old Caledonian. 'Bout time you showed up.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe newcomer fixed the speaker with a dour gaze. \"An' why should I\ncommence my tour o' dooty befair the time?\"\n\n\"Because your chief, Mr. Darl Thomas, decided that he's a filliloo\nbird or somethin', flew to his little nest up top, an' forgot to come\ndown again.\"\n\n\"Is this ain o' your jests, James Holcomb? I eenquire mairly that I\nmay ken when to laugh.\"\n\n\"It's no joke, Mac. Last I see o' him he's skippin' around the roof\nlike he has a buzzin' propeller stuck to his shoulder blades. He\nlights on th' air-lock platform, pops inside, an' goes dead for all I\nknow.\"\n\nFrom his bony legs to his scrawny neck the Scotchman's angular body,\nas nearly nude as that of the others, radiated the doubt that was\nexpressed in every seam and wrinkle of his hatchet face.\n\n\"That's straight, Angus, may I kiss a pink-eared _vanta_ if it ain't.\nHere's what happened.\" The bantering grin disappeared from Jim's\ncountenance as he detailed the events that had preceded Darl's\nvanishing. \"That was two hours ago,\" he concluded, \"and I've been\ngetting pretty uneasy about him.\"\n\n\"Why did na ye call me, so that ain o' us micht eenvestigate?\"\n\n\"Hell. Darl wasn't born yesterday, he can take care of himself.\nBesides, your last shift was pretty strenuous, an' I thought I'd let\nyou sleep. No tellin' what might happen next; this forsaken place has\nbeen givin' me the jim-jams lately.\"\n\n\"Your conseederation is touching, but--\" A scratching at the door,\naccompanied by a high squeak, interrupted him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo Jim's shouted \"Come in,\" there entered a Venusian, whose red\nrosette fastened to the green scales of his skin marked him an\noverseer. In the thread-like fingers of his hand he held a time-sheet,\nbut the nervous pulsing of his gill-membranes caused Holcomb to\nexclaim anxiously: \"What's wrong, Ran-los? No accident, I hope?\"\n\nThe shrill combination of squeaks and twitterings that came from the\nman-reptile's toothless mouth meant nothing to the Scot, but Jim's\nlast service had been on Venus and he had gained a working knowledge\nof the language. Finally the interchange was ended, and Ran-los bowed\nhimself out. Jim turned to his companion.\n\n\"There's some more queer stuff for you, Angie. Just before\nshift-change, Ran-los heard odd sounds from the other side of the\nbarrier at the end of gallery M-39. Says they seemed like signals o'\nsome kind. He's a wise old bird and if he's worried about something\nit's damn well worth lookin' into. I don't know whether to find out\nfirst what's happened to Darl, or--\"\n\nAgain there was an interruption; this time from the usually silent\nradio-communication set in the far corner. Jim leaped to the\ninstrument and snapped on the head-set. Angus leaned over him,\nwatching his intent face.\n\nFaintly, as from an immense distance, came the thin whistle of\nspace-radio. \"S-W-A ... S-W-A ... S-W-A....\" The general attention\nsignal for all Earth's far-flung outposts from Jupiter to Mercury! The\nsignal was coming from \"M-I-T-A,\" the Earth company's home station on\nthe Moon, outside the Heaviside layer. \"S-W-A ... S-W-A ... M-I-T-A ...\nM-I-T-A.\" Again the signal rose and fell.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJim reached for the sending key and pounded out his acknowledgement:\n\"K; M-E-R ... K; M-E-R ... K; M-E-R.\" He listened again, heard Venus\nanswer, and Jupiter. Across five hundred million miles of space ITA\nmen were responding to the roll-call of Earth. A reminiscent smile\ncrossed Jim's face as he recognized the stuttering fist of Rade\nPerrin, on Eros. Rade always sent as if he were afraid the instrument\nwould snap at his fingers.\n\nM-I-T-A was signalling again, and now came the message: \"S-W-A. All\ntrading posts, mines and colonies are warned to prepare for possible\nattack. The Earth Government has just announced the receipt of an\nultimatum from--\" A raucous howl cut across the message and drowned it\nout. The siren blast howled on and on, mocking Jim's straining ears.\n\"Well I'll be--Interference! Deliberate blanketing! The rats! The--\"\nHe blazed into a torrent of profanity whose imaginativeness was\nmatched only by its virulence.\n\nMac was clutching his shoulder, stirred for once out of his vaunted\n\"deegnity.\" \"What is it, mon, what is it?\"\n\n\"War, you bloody Scotchman, war! That's what it is!\"\n\n\"War! Foosh, man, 'tis eempossible!\"\n\n\"The hell it's impossible! Damn, and Darl not here! Take over, Mac;\nI've got to go up an' get him!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the meantime Thomas' helpless journey had come to an end. After an\ninterminable descent in what to him had been pitch darkness, the giant\nwho was carrying him halted. Darl had heard the whistling inrush of\nair into some lock, then the clanging of a door. He felt himself\nhurled to the ground. Fumbling hands tugged at him, drew off his space\nsuit.\n\nThe dim light of the cavern, as the helmet was dragged from his head,\nhurt Darl's eyes. Salt sweat stung them. It was hot, hotter than the\nDome, hot as it was in the surta mine, where only the nerveless\nVenusians could work for any length of time.\n\nDarl struggled to focus his eyes on a blurred blue form that towered\nabove him. He felt sharp claws scratch at him and realized that cords\nwere being passed around his limp body. They cut tightly into his legs\nand his arms. Then he was staring at a tube in the hand of his captor.\nIts end glowed with a brilliant purple light, and he felt a flood of\nreawakened energy warm him. His head jerked up, he strained against\nthe taut, strong fibers binding him. The paralysis was gone, but he\nwas still helpless.\n\nA husky, rumbling voice broke the silence. \"I wouldn't struggle,\nEarthman, if I were you. Even should you get free I still have my\nray-tube. And my little friends would ask nothing better than your\nbody to play with.\"\n\nDarl writhed to a sitting posture. Now he could see his mysterious\nabductor clearly. This eight-foot, blue-feathered individual, with\ncurved beak and beady eyes glittering from his naked, repulsively\nwrinkled head, was a Martian! Despite the human shape of his body,\ndespite his jointed limbs and thumbed hands, this denizen of the red\nplanet resembled a vulture far more than he did any other Earth\ncreature.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Earthman's pride of race came to his rescue. \"What's the game?\" he\ngrowled. \"Looking for trouble?\" There was nothing in Darl's voice to\nshow the fear that chilled him. Behind the Martian he could see\nvaguely a group of little yellow Mercurians.\n\n\"I'll ask all the questions here. And you'll answer them, too, if\nyou're wise. Even your dull mind should comprehend that you are in my\npower.\"\n\nDarl decided to proceed more cautiously. \"What do you want from me?\"\nhe asked.\n\n\"I want,\" the Martian answered, \"the recognition signal of Earth's\nspace-ships.\"\n\n\"What!\" The ejaculation burst from Darl's throat. This alien wanted\nthe secret code, the watch-word that distinguished Earth's space\nships, that gained for them free admittance to ITA's armed posts on\nthe outer planets! This could mean only one thing, that the long\nrivalry, the ancient dispute between Earth and Mars was about to flare\ninto open war. Any friendly visit from a foreign flier would be\nheralded by word from M-I-T-A. Thomas' face became a stony mask,\ncovering the tumult of his mind.\n\n\"You understood. I want the Earth recognition signal at once--and\nafter that, the surrender of the Dome.\" The very calmness of the husky\ntones was a threat.\n\n\"Never!\"\n\n\"I warn you, Darl Thomas. It would be the better part of wisdom for\nyou to yield willingly what I ask. You will give in eventually, and\nthe means of persuasion I shall use will not be exactly--pleasant.\"\n\n\"You'll get nothing from me!\"\n\nThe outlander's lidless eyes were filmed with a gray membrane. His\nhead thrust forward, the feathered ruff beneath it bristled. Darl\nbraced himself to withstand the swooping pounce that seemed imminent,\nthe slash of the sharp beak. A burring rattle broke the momentary\nhush. The Martian relaxed, turned to the Mercurian from whom the sound\nhad come and replied with staccato vibrance.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs the cave filled with a whirring tumult Darl had a chance to examine\nthe Mercurian natives crowding around his prostrate body. They were\nlittle yellow midgets, ranging from eighteen inches to two feet in\nheight. Half of their small stature was taken up by snouted heads,\nwith saucer-like, crimson eyes, and long white tusks jutting from\nfoam-flecked mouths. The trunks were globular. The spindling legs and\nthin arms ended in sharp claws. There was an impression of animal\nferocity about these tiny beings that stamped them as utter savages.\n\nHis captor was speaking to the Earthman again, his horny beak parted\nin what might have been a grim smile. \"My friends remind me that I\npromised you to them. They have not forgotten how you and your fellows\ndrove them from their burrows.\"\n\nDarl was suddenly cold, though the sweat still streamed from his bound\nbody. An uncontrollable shudder took him as he saw what the diminutive\nclaws of the midgets held. While the Dome was still an unfinished\nframework one of the Terrestrian artisans had somehow been isolated\nfrom his fellows. Thomas had been of the party that found what was\nleft of him, and the memory was still a throbbing nightmare.\n\n\"Once more! Will you give me the recognition signal?\"\n\nDarl shook his head, and prayed for sudden death. The Martian spoke to\nthe dwarfs. They started forward, saliva drooling from their tusks.\nDarl gritted his teeth. He would hold out as long as was humanly\npossible.\n\nA shrill rhythmic whistle came from somewhere outside. The blue giant\nstarted and snapped something to the Mercurians. Then he turned to\nDarl. \"I must leave you for a little while,\" he said. \"You have till\nI return to change your mind.\" With a parting admonition to the\nsavages he was gone through a side door that Thomas had not noticed\nbefore.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGrateful for the postponement, however short, of the inescapable\nordeal, Darl took stock of his situation. He lay, firmly bound, on the\ngritty rock floor of a low-ceiled cave about twelve feet square. In\none wall was a door of red metal. The portal through which the Martian\nhad vanished was next to it. Darl repressed an exclamation when he saw\nthe opposite wall. It was of solid metal, bluishly iridescent. That\nwas beryllium steel, the alloy from which the barriers at the\nterminals of the surta mine were fashioned. He forced his head higher.\nThere were the marks of the jointures, the weldings that he himself\nhad made.\n\nThe discovery seemed only to emphasize the helplessness of his\npredicament. His faithful Venusians, Ran-los, Ta-ira, and the rest\nwere just on the other side of the three-inch plate of toughened\nsteel. Three inches--yet it might have been as many hundred miles for\nall the help they could give him.\n\nThe yellow pigmies were circling in a macabre dance, their crimson\neyes turned always toward him, hate glowing from their crawling\ndepths. The whistle beyond changed in character. Darl recognized it.\nIt was a Martian space-radio, the code of which Earth scientists had\nnever been able to decipher. The Mercurian circle tightened, the fetid\nsmell of the dwarfs was overpowering. Low at first, then louder and\nlouder came the rattling cacophony of their chant. It filled the\nconfined space with an overpowering clamor.\n\nDarl writhed again, rolling over and over till he had reached the\nbarrier. The pigmies gave way before him; evidently they had been\nwarned to keep their claws off. With his insteps Thomas could reach\nthe helmet of his space suit, where it had been dropped against the\nwall. He drove it against the metal and the clangor of its striking\nreverberated through the chamber. Darl managed to regulate the sound.\nHe was now hammering out double knocks, long and short, spaced in the\ndots and dashes of the Morse code. \"H-E-L-P D-A-R-L H-E-L-P D-A-R-L\nH-E-L-P....\"\n\nIt was like some scene out of a madman's dream, this dim-lit cavern\nwith its circling, dancing pigmies, the human figure lying sidewise on\nthe ground, the rattling, savage chant and the metallic tattoo of\nDarl's hopeless message. A diabolic orgy of weird sound and\ncrisscrossing shadows.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt seemed hours that he pounded the helmet against the wall, hoping\nthat the sound of it would be audible above the clamor of the midgets.\nHis knees and hips were aching and numb, his leg ripped, almost to the\nbone by the sharp edges of the jagged floor. A sudden thought struck\nhim. The fiber thongs that bound him were also rubbing against the\nrock. His flesh was terribly torn. Perhaps the thongs, too, had been\nfrayed, weakened by the long continued friction.\n\nHe stopped the pounding signals and began to force his knees apart\nwith all the power of his burly calves. The cords cut into his bulging\nmuscles, cut into and through his skin. The veins stood out on his\nforehead, his neck was a corded pillar, his teeth bit through his lip\nas he stifled a scream of pain. Then, startlingly, the fibers snapped.\nHis legs at least were free! He could fight, die fighting, and take\nthese others with him into oblivion!\n\nDarl leaped to his feet. Before the astounded natives realized what\nwas up he was charging into their circle. A well aimed kick sent one\ncrashing against the further wall. Another crunched against the rock.\nThen they were on him, a frothing wave of tiny furies. A score or\nmore, they swarmed over him as a pack of African wild dogs swarms over\na huge water-buffalo marked for the kill. Their claws scratched and\ntore, their sharp fangs stabbed into his flesh. His arms were still\ntightly bound to his sides, and he lashed out with his sandaled feet,\nswung his shoulders like battering rams, whirled in a dervish dance.\nTheir brittle bones cracked under his hammer blows. They dropped from\nhim like squashed flies. But, small as they were, he was terrifically\noutnumbered. By sheer weight of numbers they dragged him down, and\npiled on top of him as he lay, quivering and half-conscious, on the\nblood-soaked floor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThrough the blackness that welled and burst in his brain, one thought\nheld. He had fooled the Martian, for in another instant the enraged\nsavages, would kill him and the password to Earth's outposts would be\nsafe. Already, he felt their fangs at his throat.\n\nA whirring rattle cut through the turmoil like a whip-lash, and the\nheap of pigmies swiftly scattered. The man-bird from Mars was in the\nroom. To Darl he was a blurred blueness from which glittered those two\njet beads of eyes. As from a distance he heard a rumble, its meaning\nbeating dully to him. \"Not so easy, Thomas, not so easy. I want that\nsignal, and by Tana, I'm going to have it.\"\n\nThe Earthman felt a current of cooler air. Instinctively he drew it\ninto his lungs. It swept him up from the blackness that was closing in\nabout him, brought him back to consciousness and despair. The\nchattering Mercurians crowded round to commence their interrupted\norgy. \"For the last time, Earthman, will you talk?\"\n\nDarl shook his head weakly and closed his eyes. In a moment--\n\nSuddenly there was a crash of metal on metal. Another! The clangor of\nfalling steel. Now someone was shouting, \"Darl, Darl, are you alive?\"\nAll about him were shrill twitterings, squeaking calls, squeals and\nscutterings. Darl's nostrils stung with the odor of burned flesh. A\ndoor slammed....\n\nHe opened his eyes on a confused riot, saw Jim crouched, flashing\nray-gun in hand. There was a hole in the barrier, and a mob of\ngreen-scaled Venusians were crowding through. Jim's ray caught the\nlast Mercurian and the dwarf vanished in a cloud of acrid, greasy\nsmoke.\n\n\"Thank God you've come!\" Darl managed to gasp. Then cool blackness\nclosed around him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDarl Thomas lay on a cot in the headquarters tent, swathed from head\nto foot in an inch-thick wrapping of bandages. Jim's theory was that\nif one bandage was good, two were better, and he had cleaned out the\npost's slender stock. The red-haired Earthman was seated at the cot's\nside, watching the taciturn Scot operating the control board. He was\ntelling Darl of the stirring message from M-I-T-A, and of the\nblanketing interference that marred the completion of the message.\n\n\"I didn't know what to do first,\" he continued, \"whether to go down\nbelow and find out what Ran-los was battin' about, or shoot up to you\nin the connin' tower with the message. Like the thick-head I am, I\npicked the wrong thing. I sure got the gimmicks when I found the\nlook-out empty, an' a space suit an' ray-gun gone.\" Jim grinned\nmirthlessly. \"I was runnin' around in circles. You were outside, God\nalone knows how long. Believe me, I had you crossed off the list! That\nleft two of us. With a war on, somebody had to stand guard in the\nlook-out, the control board here had to be watched, an' somebody else\nhad to get below.\n\n\"I was just tryin' to figure out a way o' cuttin' myself in half when\nI thought o' Ran-los. For a Weenie he's got a heck of a lot of sense.\nI zoomed down, hauled him out o' his bunk, scooted back up, showed him\nhow to work the peri-telescope an' the big beam-thrower, an' left him\nthere on guard.\"\n\n\"Best thing you could have done.\" Darl's voice was muffled by the\nbandages in which his head, as well as the rest of his body, was\nswathed. \"He's got a head on his shoulders, that bird.\"\n\n\"Somethin' told me to take a ray-gun down in the mine with me. I was\njust steppin' out o' the elevator when I caught your last signal; -L-P\nD-A-R-L was all I got, but it was enough. How you ever got the other\nside of the barrier had me wingin', but you were there right enough,\nand yellin' for help. Ran-los had been doin' some repairs on a head\nsupport an' his weldin' machine was still there. Takin' an awful\nchance on there bein' air on the other side, I butted it up against\nthe wall, shot the flame against the steel, and when she was soft\nenough had some of the Weenies smash her in with sledge-hammers. First\nthing I see is you, stretched out in a pool o' blood, with a couple of\nthose yellow imps just gettin' to work on you. I clipped them\nfirst--that gave the Martian a chance to get away. An' then--well, you\nknow the rest.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I owe you one for that, Jim. Too bad, though, the big fellow escaped;\nwe'll hear from him again, or I don't know the breed. Wonder how he\ngot on the planet.\"\n\n\"The sucker must 'a' stowed away on the last recruit ship from Venus,\nslipped in a case o' tools or somethin'. Mars has labor agents there,\ntoo, you know, for their farms on Ganymede.\"\n\n\"Possibly. He knew my name, and that I was chief here. He's rigged up\nan air-lock out there, though I can't figure out how he gets the air.\"\n\n\"That's easy. While I was repairin' the barrier I found a pipe runnin'\nthrough. He's been stealin' ours. Which, by the same token, is why he\nwas punchin' holes in the Dome rather than down below, where he would\nhave been safer from discovery.\"\n\n\"So that's it. Get anything more on the space-radio?\"\n\n\"Nope. Angus has kept the ear-flaps on, but the ether is still jammed.\nHey, what're you up to?\"\n\nDarl was swinging his bandaged body up from the cot that had been set\nup in the headquarters tent at his insistence. \"Can't lie on my back,\"\nhe panted, \"with that devil loose on the planet. Lord knows what he's\nup to now. We're short-handed enough as it is.\"\n\nHe rose to his feet, staggering with weakness and loss of blood. But\nhis indomitable will drove him on. \"I'll take over the control board.\nSend Angus up to relieve Ran-los, and you get below and speed up\nproduction. Earth will need double quantities of surta for food, now\nthat there's a war on.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJim turned to convey the order to the Scot, but he whirled to the\ntent-flap instead as a riot of sound exploded outside. He tore aside\nthe canvas, and now there was a burst of shrill, frightened Venusian\ncries, and a deeper, rattling chorus. Out on the Dome floor, pouring\nfrom the shaft-head in a panic torrent, came the Venusians. And among\nthem, leaping, slashing, dragging them down, were countless little\nyellow men, their fangs and tusks and curving claws crimson with the\nblood of their victims.\n\n\"Darl, Mac, they've broken through! The Mercs have broken through!\"\nThe brown plain was a blood-spattered battlefield. Here and there\nlittle groups of the green men, braver than the rest, fought with\nspanner and hammer and whatever improvised weapon they may have found.\n\"Come on, give 'em hell!\" The three Earthmen dashed out, weapons in\nhand. But friend and foe were so intermingled that they could not use\nthe devastating ray of their hand-guns. The fighting Venusians were\nvanishing under a tossing sea of yellow imps. And still the dwarfs\npoured forth from the mine entrance.\n\nA blue form towered, far back, where all green had vanished, and only\nMercurians were left. The Martian's beak opened in a rattling call. A\ngroup of hundreds of pigmies suddenly left the main fight, and came\nforward with short, swift steps. They dashed straight for the Earth\ntrio and cut them off from the Venusians they were running to aid.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSide by side the three fought. Their weapons grew hot in their hands\nas the beams cut great swaths in the seething ranks. The attackers\nhalted, gave back, then surged forward again as the roar of their\nalien commander lashed them on.\n\nThe Earthmen faced the frenzied throng. A cleared circle was still\naround them. Beyond, the Venusians were all down. The Mercurian mob\nwas closing in, the Terrestrians' rays had lost half their range. In\nmoments now the ray-guns would be exhausted.\n\n\"The plane!\" Darl shouted. \"Back to the plane, it's our only chance.\"\n\nThe gyrocopter that could carry them aloft, out of the rout, was fifty\nfeet away. They fought through to it and reached it just as the last\nfaint charge flashed from Mac's tube. Jim was at the controls, Darl\nsmashed his useless projector into the chattering face of a dwarf that\nhad leaped on the Scot's shoulders and dragged Angus into the cockpit.\n\nThe overloaded flier zoomed to the landing at the lofty air-lock's\nmanhole and hovered as Darl and Angus slipped home the hooks that held\nit to the platform. \"The spy has the Dome,\" Jim grunted, \"but by God,\nhe hasn't got us. We'll be safe in the lock up here, till help comes.\nAnd then--\"\n\n\"Safe is it?\" Angus broke in. \"Mon, luik ye what those bairns fra hell\nare up to the noo.\"\n\nA yellow tide was rising about the base of each of the latticed steel\narches that vaulted to the Earthmen's refuge. On every side the dwarfs\nwere climbing, were swarming up the walls in numbers so great that\nthey concealed the metal beneath. Up, up they came, slowly but surely.\nAnd right in the center of the plain, ankle-deep in the torn fragments\nof the murdered Venusians, was the Martian, directing the attack.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJim groaned. \"I might've known he'd never let us get away. It's slow\nbells for us, I guess. Hey, where's Darl?\"\n\n\"Gone weethin. No, guid losh, he's here!\"\n\nDarl appeared, his features pale and drawn, carrying an armful of\nray-guns. \"Grab these,\" he snapped. \"We're not licked yet.\"\n\n\"Licked, hell!\" Jim's roar reverberated. \"We've just begun to fight!\"\nThe Scot was silent, but the battle light shone in his eyes. In\nanother moment the Terrestrians were kneeling, were raking the roof\ngirders as the mounting Mercurians came within range. Each had two\nray-guns in his hands, and a little pile of extra tubes beside him.\nThey fought silently, wasting not a single blast.\n\nSix white rays flamed through the misty, humid air, and striking the\nteeming girders, swept them clean. A greasy, horrible smoke cloud\ngathered along the shell and drifted slowly down, till the concrete\nblocks from which the steel framework sprang were hidden in a black\npall. Fighters, these three, true ITA men who had left memories of\ntheir battle-prowess on more than one wild planet! Gaunt-bodied\ndemi-gods of war, they hurled crackling bolts of destruction from\ntheir perch at the Dome top. By hundreds, by thousands, the Mercurian\npigmies vanished in dark vapor, or plunged, blackened corpses, into\nthe fog that billowed below.\n\nOne by one the tubes were discharged and tossed down at the seething\nmob. The heaped weapons dwindled, and still the climbing hordes\nrenewed themselves, came on in endless mounting streams to sure\ndestruction. The open tunnel vomited forth a torrent of gibbering\ndwarfs. From the uttermost burrows of the planet the pigmies were\nflooding in at the call of the Martian who stood scatheless beneath\nand lashed them on with the strange dominance he held over them. The\nEarthmen fought on, endlessly, till they were sick of killing,\nnauseated with slaughter. And still the snouted, red-eyed imps came\non.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJim snatched up his last two ray-guns. Out of the corner of his eye he\nnoted that Darl was using but one, the other, his last, was thrust\ninto the chief's belt. He wondered at this, but a new spurt of yellow\nabove the oily fog wiped the question from his lips. \"Swallow that,\nyou filthy lice! Hope you like the way it tastes!\" His guns spouted\ndeath.\n\n\"I'm through!\" The call came at last from McDermott. \"Me too!\" Jim\nHolcomb hurled his final, futile tubes down at the blue figure of the\nMars man. A moment's hush held the trio. Then Jim flexed his great\nhands. \"Well, these'll take care of a couple more o' them before I\ncheck in.\"\n\n\"No you don't,\" Darl barked, his face a graven image. \"Inside with\nyou. The lock will hold 'em off.\"\n\n\"Yeah? Look.\"\n\nThomas swung in the direction Jim was pointing. Rising above the murk,\nsomething glinted in the pale light. On the furthest upright a clumped\ngroup of climbing savages were struggling to drag up one of the\nwelding machines, a long black hose snaking from its cylindrical bulk.\n\n\"They'll cut through the steel in fifteen minutes with that. The\nbloody bugger ain't missin' a trick.\"\n\n\"Inside, I tell you.\" Darl's crisp tone of command brooked no denial.\nThe three crowded into the cool recesses of the manmade aerie. Angus\nslammed the steel door shut. Even if by some miracle the Dome wall\nshould be pierced and the air in the main vault dissipated into outer\nspace, this air-tight compartment hung from the hemisphere's roof\nwould remain, a last refuge, till the atmosphere within had become\npoisonous through the Earthmen's slow breathing. But the Martian had\nanticipated Darl's final move. The oxy-hydrogen jet of the welding\nmachine the dwarfs were hoisting would make short work of their final\ndefense.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom the conning-tower above Ran-los called excitedly. Through all the\nlong battle the Venusian had remained steadfast at the peri-telescope,\nscanning the vacant terrain outside, and the heavens. As Darl and Jim\ndashed for the stairs Mac ran after them, crying out, \"What did he say,\nmon?\"\n\n\"Space ship in sight,\" Darl flung over his shoulder as he reached the\nupper landing.\n\n\"Praise be! Noo the haythan weel get his desairts!\"\n\n\"Yeah, maybe--if it's an Earth ship. But we won't be here to see it.\"\n\nJim's red head was bending over the peri-telescope view-screen. \"She's\nstill thirty thousand miles away. Give her a speed of fifteen per\nsecond--she'll have to slow up to land, can't make it under forty-five\nminutes. By then we'll be in little pieces. It took me ten minutes to\nburn through the barrier when I rescued Darl, and it won't take the\nMercs any longer to get at us.\"\n\nDarl was very sober as he looked on with narrowed eyes. Against a\nbackground of velvet black, gold spangled, the slim space-traveler\nshowed. The sun's rays caught her, and she was a tiny silver fish in\nthe boundless void.\n\n\"Luik ye, mon, luik ye!\" Angus, fairly dancing with excitement,\nelbowed Darl aside. \"She's from Airth, richt enow!\" At the nose of the\noncoming flier a rapid succession of colored lights had flashed, the\nrecognition signal that should give her safe access to the Dome. Again\nthere was a coruscation of coded flashes. \"She's a battle cruiser,\nwhat's mair!\" the Scot exclaimed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDarl sprang to the keyboard that manipulated the signal lights from\nthe Dome's roof. \"No use,\" he said, after a short while. \"The Martian\nhas cut off the current from the dynamos. I can't warn the ship.\" He\nmade a hopeless gesture.\n\nJim looked at him wonderingly. \"Warn 'em? What for? Even if we are all\ndead when she reaches here, at least she'll clean up the Mercs, and\nretake the Dome for Earth.\"\n\n\"Don't you see it? When the Mars man has once blasted his way in here\nand disposed of us, he'll be ready for the space ship. Her captain\ncan't suspect anything wrong. He must have left Earth at the time of\nthe ultimatum, and would easily get here before any ship could be sent\nout from Mars. He'll come on till he's within range of the\nbeam-thrower, and the Martian will aim, press the trigger and the\nEarth ship and her crew of a half a thousand brave lads will be\nstar-dust.\"\n\n\"Oh God!\" Jim was white-faced. \"Isn't there anything we can do? Maybe\nif he doesn't get our all-clear signal he'll sheer off.\" This was\nclutching at straws.\n\n\"Why should he? He must know how short-handed we are, and will simply\nthink we're not on watch, or that our signal lights are out of order.\nMatter of fact, if he were at all suspicious he should be alternating\nhis course right now--and he hasn't. Look.\"\n\nSeemingly motionless, but really splitting the ether with terrific\nspeed, the warship was coming straight on to garrison the beleaguered\npost. She had never wavered from her straight course for the Dome. The\nlittle group was silent, watching the help that was coming at last,\ncoming too late.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom below there came a thunder of sound. Jim slid down the stairs. An\nirregular disk on the wall was glowing cherry-red from the heat of the\nblow-torch without, and the metal was quivering under the Mercurian's\nsledge-hammer blows. \"Darl's right,\" he almost sobbed as he gazed\nhelplessly. \"They'll be through in no time. The Dome's gone, we're\ngone, the space ship's gone!\"\n\n\"Let me pass, Jim.\" Thomas' quiet voice sounded behind him. Holcomb\nturned. His leader was in a space suit, the helmet still unfastened.\n\n\"Blazes! Where the devil are you going?\"\n\n\"Here, cover me with this till I reach the gyrocopter, then get back\nquick, and seal the air-lock.\" Darl thrust into Jim's hand the ray-gun\nhe had previously reserved. \"There's only one way to kill off the\nMartian and his mob. I'm taking it.\"\n\nSuddenly Jim Holcomb understood. \"No, Darl, no--you can't do it! Not\nyou! Let me go! I'm just a dumbhead. Let me go!\"\n\n\"Thanks, Jimmy, but it's my place.\" Darl's voice was low, and very\ncalm. \"I was in charge, and I lost the Dome. If I can save the boys on\nthe ship, and you two, it's the least I can do. Good-by, old man. Give\nmy regards to Earth.\"\n\nThomas' face was gray-white. The thick bandages that still swathed\nhim, Jim glimpsed them through the open neckpiece of the suit, gave\nhim the semblance of a mummy. The helmet clicked shut. Swallowing a\nlump that rose in his throat, Jim pulled open the door. A wave of\nMercurians surged in, to be seared into nothingness by his weapon. He\nwas in the doorway, his ray sweeping the platform clear.\n\nDarl was out now, stepping into the flier that still hung by its\nhooked moorings. Jim caught a flash of blue and looked up. The Martian\nwas hanging to a girder just above, his green tube pointing straight\nat Darl. A white ray spurted from Jim's gun. The Martian's weapon and\nthe hand that held it vanished in the sizzling blast. The plane was\nloose! Jim leaped inside the air-lock, slammed the steel door shut,\nclamped it, and sprang for the quartz peer-hole.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDarl's gyrocopter was diving on a long slant for the Dome wall. Faster\nand faster it went, till all Jim could see was a white streak in the\nsmoky dimness. And now he could see the vast interior, the teeming\nplain, the dwarf-festooned girders and roof-beams. He stood rigid,\nwaiting breathlessly. Then the plane struck--fair in the center of a\ngreat panel of quartz. The wall exploded in a burst of flying,\nshattered splinters. A deafening crash rocked the Dome.\n\nJim clung to his port-hole, tears rolling down his cheeks, unashamed.\nThe plane, and Darl, vanished. Jim saw the black smoke masses whirl\nthrough the jagged hole in the Dome's wall as the air burst out in a\ncyclonic gust. He saw the vast space filled with falling Mercurians,\nsaw a blue form plunge down and crash far below. He knew that in all\nthat huge hemisphere, and in the burrows beneath it, there was no life\nsave himself, and Angus, and the faithful Ran-los. For only in this\ncompartment that clung to the roof of the Dome was there left air to\nbreathe. And, from the void beyond, the silver space ship sped on\ntoward Mercury, sped on to a safe landing that, but for Darl Thomas's\nsacrifice, would have been her doom....\n\nGuided by Jim and Angus, a party of men from the battle-flier,\nequipped with oxygen respirators, went to the aid of Darl. They dug\nhim out from under his crumpled plane and the piled splinters of\nquartz. His metal was dented and twisted, but unpierced. They carried\nhim tenderly to the space ship, and carefully set him down. The ship's\nphysician listened long with his stethoscope, then looked up and\nsmiled.\n\n\"He's alive,\" the doctor said, \"just barely alive. The thick padding\nof bandages must have saved him from the full shock of the crash.\nThey're hard to kill, these ITA men. I'll be able to bring him around,\nGod willing.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Great Dome on Mercury, by Arthur Leo Zagat\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE GREAT DOME ON MERCURY ***\n\n***** This file should be named 29190.txt or 29190.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/9/1/9/29190/\n\nProduced by Sankar Viswanathan, Greg Weeks, and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
