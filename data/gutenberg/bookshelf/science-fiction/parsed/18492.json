The shuttle wasn't supposed to leave for\nanother forty-five minutes!\"\n\nThe clerk blinked at the schedule, and shrugged. \"The seats were full,\nso it left,\" he said. \"Graduation time, you know. Everybody has to be\nsomewhere else, right away. The next shuttle goes in three hours.\"\n\n\"But I had a reservation on this one,\" Dal insisted.\n\n\"Don't be silly,\" the clerk said sharply. \"Only graduates can get\nreservations this time of year--\" He broke off to stare at Dal Timgar,\na puzzled frown on his face. \"Let me see that reservation.\"\n\nDal fumbled in his pants pocket for the yellow reservation slip. He was\nwishing now that he'd kept his mouth shut. He was acutely conscious of\nthe clerk's suspicious stare, and suddenly he felt extremely awkward.\nThe Earth-cut trousers had never really fit Dal very well; his legs were\ntoo long and spindly, and his hips too narrow to hold the pants up\nproperly. The tailor in the Philadelphia shop had tried three times to\nmake a jacket fit across Dal's narrow shoulders, and finally had given\nup in despair. Now, as he handed the reservation slip across the\ncounter, Dal saw the clerk staring at the fine gray fur that coated the\nback of his hand and arm. \"Here it is,\" he said angrily. \"See for\nyourself.\"\n\nThe clerk looked at the slip and handed it back indifferently. \"It's a\nvalid reservation, all right, but there won't be another shuttle to\nHospital Seattle for three hours,\" he said, \"unless you have a priority\ncard, of course.\"\n\n\"No, I'm afraid I don't,\" Dal said. It was a ridiculous suggestion, and\nthe clerk knew it. Only physicians in the Black Service of Pathology and\na few Four-star Surgeons had the power to commandeer public aircraft\nwhenever they wished. \"Can I get on the next shuttle?\"\n\n\"You can try,\" the clerk said, \"but you'd better be ready when they\nstart loading. You can wait up on the ramp if you want to.\"\n\nDal turned and started across the main concourse of the great airport.\nHe felt a stir of motion at his side, and looked down at the small pink\nfuzz-ball sitting in the crook of his arm. \"Looks like we're out of\nluck, pal,\" he said gloomily. \"If we don't get on the next plane, we'll\nmiss the hearing altogether. Not that it's going to do us much good to\nbe there anyway.\"\n\nThe little pink fuzz-ball on his arm opened a pair of black shoe-button\neyes and blinked up at him, and Dal absently stroked the tiny creature\nwith a finger. The fuzz-ball quivered happily and clung closer to Dal's\nside as he started up the long ramp to the observation platform.\nAutomatic doors swung open as he reached the top, and Dal shivered in\nthe damp night air. He could feel the gray fur that coated his back and\nneck rising to protect him from the coldness and dampness that his body\nwas never intended by nature to endure.\n\nBelow him the bright lights of the landing fields and terminal buildings\nof the port of Philadelphia spread out in panorama, and he thought with\na sudden pang of the great space-port in his native city, so very\ndifferent from this one and so unthinkably far away. The field below was\nteeming with activity, alive with men and vehicles. Moments before, one\nof Earth's great hospital ships had landed, returning from a cruise deep\ninto the heart of the galaxy, bringing in the gravely ill from a dozen\nstar systems for care in one of Earth's hospitals. Dal watched as the\nlong line of stretchers poured from the ship's hold with white-clad\norderlies in nervous attendance. Some of the stretchers were encased in\nspecial atmosphere tanks; a siren wailed across the field as an\nemergency truck raced up with fresh gas bottles for a chlorine-breather\nfrom the Betelgeuse system, and a derrick crew spent fifteen minutes\nlifting down the special liquid ammonia tank housing a native of\nAldebaran's massive sixteenth planet.\n\nAll about the field were physicians supervising the process of\ndisembarcation, resplendent in the colors that signified their medical\nspecialties. At the foot of the landing crane a Three-star Internist in\nthe green cape of the Medical Service--obviously the commander of the\nship--was talking with the welcoming dignitaries of Hospital Earth.\nHalf a dozen doctors in the Blue Service of Diagnosis were checking new\nlab supplies ready to be loaded aboard. Three young Star Surgeons swung\nby just below Dal with their bright scarlet capes fluttering in the\nbreeze, headed for customs and their first Earthside liberty in months.\nDal watched them go by, and felt the sick, bitter feeling in the pit of\nhis stomach that he had felt so often in recent months.\n\nHe had dreamed, once, of wearing the scarlet cape of the Red Service of\nSurgery too, with the silver star of the Star Surgeon on his collar.\nThat had been a long time ago, over eight Earth years ago; the dream had\nfaded slowly, but now the last vestige of hope was almost gone. He\nthought of the long years of intensive training he had just completed in\nthe medical school of Hospital Philadelphia, the long nights of studying\nfor exams, the long days spent in the laboratories and clinics in order\nto become a physician of Hospital Earth, and a wave of bitterness swept\nthrough his mind.\n\n_A dream_, he thought hopelessly, _a foolish idea and nothing more. They\nknew before I started that they would never let me finish. They had no\nintention of doing so, it just amused them to watch me beat my head on a\nstone wall for these eight years._ But then he shook his head and felt a\nlittle ashamed of the thought. It wasn't quite true, and he knew it. He\nhad known that it was a gamble from the very first. Black Doctor\nArnquist had warned him the day he received his notice of admission to\nthe medical school. \"I can promise you nothing,\" the old man had said,\n\"except a slender chance. There are those who will fight to the very end\nto prevent you from succeeding, and when it's all over, you may not win.\nBut if you are willing to take that risk, at least you have a chance.\"\n\nDal had accepted the risk with his eyes wide open. He had done the best\nhe could do, and now he had lost. True, he had not received the final,\nirrevocable word that he had been expelled from the medical service of\nHospital Earth, but he was certain now that it was waiting for him when\nhe arrived at Hospital Seattle the following morning.\n\nThe loading ramp was beginning to fill up, and Dal saw half a dozen of\nhis classmates from the medical school burst through the door from the\nstation below, shifting their day packs from their shoulders and\nchattering among themselves. Several of them saw him, standing by\nhimself against the guard rail. One or two nodded coolly and turned\naway; the others just ignored him. Nobody greeted him, nor even smiled.\nDal turned away and stared down once again at the busy activity on the\nfield below.\n\n\"Why so gloomy, friend?\" a voice behind him said. \"You look as though\nthe ship left without you.\"\n\nDal looked up at the tall, dark-haired young man, towering at his side,\nand smiled ruefully. \"Hello, Tiger! As a matter of fact, it _did_ leave.\nI'm waiting for the next one.\"\n\n\"Where to?\" Frank Martin frowned down at Dal. Known as \"Tiger\" to\neveryone but the professors, the young man's nickname fit him well. He\nwas big, even for an Earthman, and his massive shoulders and stubborn\njaw only served to emphasize his bigness. Like the other recent\ngraduates on the platform, he was wearing the colored cuff and collar of\nthe probationary physician, in the bright green of the Green Service of\nMedicine. He reached out a huge hand and gently rubbed the pink\nfuzz-ball sitting on Dal's arm. \"What's the trouble, Dal? Even Fuzzy\nlooks worried. Where's your cuff and collar?\"\n\n\"I didn't get any cuff and collar,\" Dal said.\n\n\"Didn't you get an assignment?\" Tiger stared at him. \"Or are you just\ntaking a leave first?\"\n\nDal shook his head. \"A permanent leave, I guess,\" he said bitterly.\n\"There's not going to be any assignment for me. Let's face it, Tiger.\nI'm washed out.\"\n\n\"Oh, now look here--\"\n\n\"I mean it. I've been booted, and that's all there is to it.\"\n\n\"But you've been in the top ten in the class right through!\" Tiger\nprotested. \"You know you passed your finals. What is this, anyway?\"\n\nDal reached into his jacket and handed Tiger a blue paper envelope. \"I\nshould have expected it from the first. They sent me this instead of my\ncuff and collar.\"\n\nTiger opened the envelope. \"From Doctor Tanner,\" he grunted. \"The Black\nPlague himself. But what is it?\"\n\n\"Read it,\" Dal said.\n\n\"'You are hereby directed to appear before the medical training council\nin the council chambers in Hospital Seattle at 10:00 A.M., Friday, June\n24, 2375, in order that your application for assignment to a General\nPractice Patrol ship may be reviewed. Insignia will not be worn. Signed,\nHugo Tanner, Physician, Black Service of Pathology.'\" Tiger blinked at\nthe notice and handed it back to Dal. \"I don't get it,\" he said finally.\n\"You applied, you're as qualified as any of us--\"\n\n\"Except in one way,\" Dal said, \"and that's the way that counts. They\ndon't want me, Tiger. They have never wanted me. They only let me go\nthrough school because Black Doctor Arnquist made an issue of it, and\nthey didn't quite dare to veto him. But they never intended to let me\nfinish, not for a minute.\"\n\nFor a moment the two were silent, staring down at the busy landing\nprocedures below. A warning light was flickering across the field,\nsignaling the landing of an incoming shuttle ship, and the supply cars\nbroke from their positions in center of the field and fled like beetles\nfor the security of the garages. A loudspeaker blared, announcing the\nincoming craft. Dal Timgar turned, lifting Fuzzy gently from his arm\ninto a side jacket pocket and shouldering his day pack. \"I guess this is\nmy flight, Tiger. I'd better get in line.\"\n\nTiger Martin gripped Dal's slender four-fingered hand tightly. \"Look,\"\nhe said intensely, \"this is some sort of mistake that the training\ncouncil will straighten out. I'm sure of it. Lots of guys have their\napplications reviewed. It happens all the time, but they still get their\nassignments.\"\n\n\"Do you know of any others in this class? Or the last class?\"\n\n\"Maybe not,\" Tiger said. \"But if they were washing you out, why would\nthe council be reviewing it? Somebody must be fighting for you.\"\n\n\"But Black Doctor Tanner is on the council,\" Dal said.\n\n\"He's not the only one on the council. It's going to work out. You'll\nsee.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" Dal said without conviction. He started for the loading\nline, then turned. \"But where are _you_ going to be? What ship?\"\n\nTiger hesitated. \"Not assigned yet. I'm taking a leave. But you'll be\nhearing from me.\"\n\nThe loading call blared from the loudspeaker. The tall Earthman seemed\nabout to say something more, but Dal turned away and headed across\ntoward the line for the shuttle plane. Ten minutes later, he was aloft\nas the tiny plane speared up through the black night sky and turned its\nneedle nose toward the west.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe tried to sleep, but couldn't. The shuttle trip from the Port of\nPhiladelphia to Hospital Seattle was almost two hours long because of\npassenger stops at Hospital Cleveland, Eisenhower City, New Chicago, and\nHospital Billings. In spite of the help of the pneumatic seats and a\nsleep-cap, Dal could not even doze. It was one of the perfect clear\nnights that often occurred in midsummer now that weather control could\nmodify Earth's air currents so well; the stars glittered against the\nblack velvet backdrop above, and the North American continent was free\nof clouds. Dal stared down at the patchwork of lights that flickered up\nat him from the ground below.\n\nPassing below him were some of the great cities, the hospitals, the\nresearch and training centers, the residential zones and supply centers\nof Hospital Earth, medical center to the powerful Galactic\nConfederation, physician in charge of the health of a thousand\nintelligent races on a thousand planets of a thousand distant star\nsystems. Here, he knew, was the ivory tower of galactic medicine, the\nhub from which the medical care of the confederation arose. From the\nhuge hospitals, research centers, and medical schools here, the\nphysicians of Hospital Earth went out to all corners of the galaxy. In\nthe permanent outpost clinics, in the gigantic hospital ships that\nserved great sectors of the galaxy, and in the General Practice Patrol\nships that roved from star system to star system, they answered the\ncalls for medical assistance from a multitude of planets and races,\nwherever and whenever they were needed.\n\nDal Timgar had been on Hospital Earth for eight years, and still he was\na stranger here. To him this was an alien planet, different in a\nthousand ways from the world where he was born and grew to manhood. For\na moment now he thought of his native home, the second planet of a hot\nyellow star which Earthmen called \"Garv\" because they couldn't pronounce\nits full name in the Garvian tongue. Unthinkably distant, yet only days\naway with the power of the star-drive motors that its people had\ndeveloped thousands of years before, Garv II was a warm planet, teeming\nwith activity, the trading center of the galaxy and the governmental\nheadquarters of the powerful Galactic Confederation of Worlds. Dal could\nremember the days before he had come to Hospital Earth, and the many\ntimes he had longed desperately to be home again.\n\nHe drew his fuzzy pink friend out of his pocket and rested him on his\nshoulder, felt the tiny silent creature rub happily against his neck. It\nhad been his own decision to come here, Dal knew; there was no one else\nto blame. His people were not physicians. Their instincts and interests\nlay in trading and politics, not in the life sciences, and plague after\nplague had swept across his home planet in the centuries before Hospital\nEarth had been admitted as a probationary member of the Galactic\nConfederation.\n\nBut as long as Dal could remember, he had wanted to be a doctor. From\nthe first time he had seen a General Practice Patrol ship landing in his\nhome city to fight the plague that was killing his people by the\nthousands, he had known that this was what he wanted more than anything\nelse: to be a physician of Hospital Earth, to join the ranks of the\ndoctors who were serving the galaxy.\n\nMany on Earth had tried to stop him from the first. He was a Garvian,\nalien to Earth's climate and Earth's people. The physical differences\nbetween Earthmen and Garvians were small, but just enough to set him\napart and make him easily identifiable as an alien. He had one too few\ndigits on his hands; his body was small and spindly, weighing a bare\nninety pounds, and the coating of fine gray fur that covered all but his\nface and palms annoyingly grew longer and thicker as soon as he came to\nthe comparatively cold climate of Hospital Earth to live. The bone\nstructure of his face gave his cheeks and nose a flattened appearance,\nand his pale gray eyes seemed abnormally large and wistful. And even\nthough it had long been known that Earthmen and Garvians were equal in\nrange of intelligence, his classmates still assumed just from his\nappearance that he was either unusually clever or unusually stupid.\n\nThe gulf that lay between him and the men of Earth went beyond mere\nphysical differences, however. Earthmen had differences of skin color,\nfacial contour and physical size among them, yet made no sign of\ndistinction. Dal's alienness went deeper. His classmates had been civil\nenough, yet with one or two exceptions, they had avoided him carefully.\nClearly they resented his presence in their lecture rooms and\nlaboratories. Clearly they felt that he did not belong there, studying\nmedicine.\n\nFrom the first they had let him know unmistakably that he was unwelcome,\nan intruder in their midst, the first member of an alien race ever to\ntry to earn the insignia of a physician of Hospital Earth.\n\nAnd now, Dal knew he had failed after all. He had been allowed to try\nonly because a powerful physician in the Black Service of Pathology had\nbefriended him. If it had not been for the friendship and support of\nanother Earthman in the class, Tiger Martin, the eight years of study\nwould have been unbearably lonely.\n\nBut now, he thought, it would have been far easier never to have started\nthan to have his goal snatched away at the last minute. The notice of\nthe council meeting left no doubt in his mind. He had failed. There\nwould be lots of talk, some perfunctory debate for the sake of the\nrecord, and the medical council would wash their hands of him once and\nfor all. The decision, he was certain, was already made. It was just a\nmatter of going through the formal motions.\n\nDal felt the motors change in pitch, and the needle-nosed shuttle plane\nbegan to dip once more toward the horizon. Ahead he could see the\nsprawling lights of Hospital Seattle, stretching from the Cascade\nMountains to the sea and beyond, north to Alaska and south toward the\ngreat California metropolitan centers. Somewhere down there was a\ncouncil room where a dozen of the most powerful physicians on Hospital\nEarth, now sleeping soundly, would be meeting tomorrow for a trial that\nwas already over, to pass a judgment that was already decided.\n\nHe slipped Fuzzy back into his pocket, shouldered his pack, and waited\nfor the ship to come down for its landing. It would be nice, he thought\nwryly, if his reservations for sleeping quarters in the students'\nbarracks might at least be honored, but now he wasn't even sure of that.\n\nIn the port of Seattle he went through the customary baggage check. He\nsaw the clerk frown at his ill-fitting clothes and not-quite-human face,\nand then read his passage permit carefully before brushing him on\nthrough. Then he joined the crowd of travelers heading for the city\nsubways. He didn't hear the loudspeaker blaring until the announcer had\nstumbled over his name half a dozen times.\n\n\"_Doctor Dal Timgar, please report to the information booth._\"\n\nHe hurried back to central information. \"You were paging me. What is\nit?\"\n\n\"Telephone message, sir,\" the announcer said, his voice surprisingly\nrespectful. \"A top priority call. Just a minute.\"\n\nMoments later he had handed Dal the yellow telephone message sheet, and\nDal was studying the words with a puzzled frown:\n\n      CALL AT MY QUARTERS ON ARRIVAL REGARDLESS OF HOUR STOP\n      URGENT THAT I SEE YOU STOP REPEAT URGENT\n\nThe message was signed THORVOLD ARNQUIST, BLACK SERVICE and carried the\npriority seal of the Four-star Pathologist. Dal read it again, shifted\nhis pack, and started once more for the subway ramp. He thrust the\nmessage into his pocket, and his step quickened as he heard the whistle\nof the pressure-tube trains up ahead.\n\nBlack Doctor Arnquist, the man who had first defended his right to study\nmedicine on Hospital Earth, now wanted to see him before the council\nmeeting took place.\n\nFor the first time in days, Dal Timgar felt a new flicker of hope.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nHOSPITAL SEATTLE\n\n\nIt was a long way from the students' barracks to the pathology sector\nwhere Black Doctor Arnquist lived. Dal Timgar decided not to try to go\nto the barracks first. It was after midnight, and even though the\nmessage had said \"regardless of hour,\" Dal shrank from the thought of\nawakening a physician of the Black Service at two o'clock in the\nmorning. He was already later arriving at Hospital Seattle than he had\nexpected to be, and quite possibly Black Doctor Arnquist would be\nretiring. It seemed better to go there without delay.\n\nBut one thing took priority. He found a quiet spot in the waiting room\nnear the subway entrance and dug into his day pack for the pressed\nbiscuit and the canister of water he had there. He broke off a piece of\nthe biscuit and held it up for Fuzzy to see.\n\nFuzzy wriggled down onto his hand, and a tiny mouth appeared just below\nthe shoe-button eyes. Bit by bit Dal fed his friend the biscuit, with\nsquirts of water in between bites. Finally, when the biscuit was gone,\nDal squirted the rest of the water into Fuzzy's mouth and rubbed him\nbetween the eyes. \"Feel better now?\" he asked.\n\nThe creature seemed to understand; he wriggled in Dal's hand and blinked\nhis eyes sleepily. \"All right, then,\" Dal said. \"Off to sleep.\"\n\nDal started to tuck him back into his jacket pocket, but Fuzzy abruptly\nsprouted a pair of forelegs and began struggling fiercely to get out\nagain. Dal grinned and replaced the little creature in the crook of his\narm. \"Don't like that idea so well, eh? Okay, friend. If you want to\nwatch, that suits me.\"\n\nHe found a map of the city at the subway entrance, and studied it\ncarefully. Like other hospital cities on Earth, Seattle was primarily a\ncenter for patient care and treatment rather than a supply or\nadministrative center. Here in Seattle special facilities existed for\nthe care of the intelligent marine races that required specialized\nhospital care. The depths of Puget Sound served as a vast aquatic ward\nsystem where creatures which normally lived in salt-water oceans on\ntheir native planets could be cared for, and the specialty physicians\nwho worked with marine races had facilities here for research and\nteaching in their specialty. The dry-land sectors of the hospital were\norganized to support the aquatic wards; the surgeries, the laboratories,\nthe pharmacies and living quarters all were arranged on the periphery of\nthe salt-water basin, and rapid-transit tubes carried medical workers,\norderlies, nurses and physicians to the widespread areas of the hospital\ncity.\n\nThe pathology sector lay to the north of the city, and Black Doctor\nArnquist was the chief pathologist of Hospital Seattle. Dal found a\nnorthbound express tube, climbed into an empty capsule, and pressed the\nbuttons for the pathology sector. Presently the capsule was shifted\nautomatically into the pressure tube that would carry him thirty miles\nnorth to his destination.\n\nIt was the first time Dal had ever visited a Black Doctor in his\nquarters, and the idea made him a little nervous. Of all the medical\nservices on Hospital Earth, none had the power of the Black Service of\nPathology. Traditionally in Earth medicine, the pathologists had always\noccupied a position of power and discipline. The autopsy rooms had\nalways been the \"Temples of Truth\" where the final, inarguable answers\nin medicine were ultimately found, and for centuries pathologists had\nbeen the judges and inspectors of the profession of medicine.\n\nAnd when Earth had become Hospital Earth, with status as a probationary\nmember of the Galactic Confederation of Worlds, it was natural that the\nBlack Service of Pathology had become the governors and policy-makers,\nregimenting every aspect of the medical services provided by Earth\nphysicians.\n\nDal knew that the medical training council, which would be reviewing his\napplication in just a few hours, was made up of physicians from all the\nservices--the Green Service of Medicine, the Blue Service of Diagnosis,\nthe Red Service of Surgery, as well as the Auxiliary Services--but the\nBlack Doctors who sat on the council would have the final say, the final\nveto power.\n\nHe wondered now why Black Doctor Arnquist wanted to see him. At first he\nhad thought there might be special news for him, word perhaps that his\nassignment had come through after all, that the interview tomorrow would\nnot be held. But on reflection, he realized that didn't make sense. If\nthat were the case, Doctor Arnquist would have said so, and directed him\nto report to a ship. More likely, he thought, the Black Doctor wanted\nto see him only to soften the blow, to help him face the decision that\nseemed inevitable.\n\nHe left the pneumatic tube and climbed on the jitney that wound its way\nthrough the corridors of the pathology sector and into the quiet,\naustere quarters of the resident pathologists. He found the proper\nconcourse, and moments later he was pressing his thumb against the\nidentification plate outside the Black Doctor's personal quarters.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBlack Doctor Thorvold Arnquist looked older now than when Dal had last\nseen him. His silvery gray hair was thinning, and there were tired lines\naround his eyes and mouth that Dal did not remember from before. The old\nman's body seemed more wispy and frail than ever, and the black cloak\nacross his shoulders rustled as he led Dal back into a book-lined study.\n\nThe Black Doctor had not yet gone to bed. On a desk in the corner of the\nstudy several books lay open, and a roll of paper was inserted in the\ndicto-typer. \"I knew you would get the message when you arrived,\" he\nsaid as he took Dal's pack, \"and I thought you might be later than you\nplanned. A good trip, I trust. And your friend here? He enjoys shuttle\ntravel?\" He smiled and stroked Fuzzy with a gnarled finger. \"I suppose\nyou wonder why I wanted to see you.\"\n\nDal Timgar nodded slowly. \"About the interview tomorrow?\"\n\n\"Ah, yes. The interview.\" The Black Doctor made a sour face and shook\nhis head. \"A bad business for you, that interview. How do you feel about\nit?\"\n\nDal spread his hands helplessly. As always, the Black Doctor's questions\ncut through the trimming to the heart of things. They were always\ndifficult questions to answer.\n\n\"I ... I suppose it's something that's necessary,\" he said finally.\n\n\"Oh?\" the Black Doctor frowned. \"But why necessary for you if not for\nthe others? How many were there in your class, including all the\nservices? Three hundred? And out of the three hundred only one was\nrefused assignment.\" He looked up sharply at Dal, his pale blue eyes\nvery alert in his aged face. \"Right?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"And you really feel it's just normal procedure that your application is\nbeing challenged?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"How _do_ you feel about it, Dal? Angry, maybe?\"\n\nDal squirmed. \"Yes, sir. You might say that.\"\n\n\"Perhaps even bitter,\" the Black Doctor said.\n\n\"I did as good work as anyone else in my class,\" Dal said hotly. \"I did\nmy part as well as anyone could, I didn't let up once all the way\nthrough. Bitter! Wouldn't you feel bitter?\"\n\nThe Black Doctor nodded slowly. \"Yes, I imagine I would,\" he said,\nsinking down into the chair behind the desk with a sigh. \"As a matter of\nfact, I do feel a little bitter about it, even though I was afraid that\nit might come to this in the end. I can't blame you for your feelings.\"\nHe took a deep breath. \"I wish I could promise you that everything would\nbe all right tomorrow, but I'm afraid I can't. The council has a right\nto review your qualifications, and it holds the power to assign you to a\npatrol ship on the spot, if it sees fit. Conceivably, a Black Doctor\nmight force the council's approval, if he were the only representative\nof the Black service there. But I will not be the only Black Doctor\nsitting on the council tomorrow.\"\n\n\"I know that,\" Dal said.\n\nDoctor Arnquist looked up at Dal for a long moment. \"Why do you want to\nbe a doctor in the first place, Dal? This isn't the calling of your\npeople. You must be the one Garvian out of millions with the patience\nand peculiar mental make-up to permit you to master the scientific\ndisciplines involved in studying medicine. Either you are different from\nthe rest of your people--which I doubt--or else you are driven to force\nyourself into a pattern foreign to your nature for very compelling\nreasons. What are they? Why do you want medicine?\"\n\nIt was the hardest question of all, the question Dal had dreaded. He\nknew the answer, just as he had known for most of his life that he\nwanted to be a doctor above all else. But he had never found a way to\nput the reasons into words. \"I can't say,\" he said slowly. \"I _know_,\nbut I can't express it, and whenever I try, it just sounds silly.\"\n\n\"Maybe your reasons don't make reasonable sense,\" the old man said\ngently.\n\n\"But they do! At least to me, they do,\" Dal said. \"I've always wanted to\nbe a doctor. There's nothing else I want to do. To work at home, among\nmy people.\"\n\n\"There was a plague on Garv II, wasn't there?\" Doctor Arnquist said. \"A\ncyclic thing that came back again and again. The cycle was broken just a\nfew years ago, when the virus that caused it was finally isolated and\ndestroyed.\"\n\n\"By the physicians of Hospital Earth,\" Dal said.\n\n\"It's happened again and again,\" the Black Doctor said. \"We've seen the\nsame pattern repeated a thousand times across the galaxy, and it has\nalways puzzled us, just a little.\" He smiled. \"You see, our knowledge\nand understanding of the life sciences here on Earth have always grown\nhand in hand with the physical sciences. We had always assumed that the\nsame thing would happen on _any_ planet where a race has developed\nintelligence and scientific methods of study. We were wrong, of course,\nwhich is the reason for the existence of Hospital Earth and her\nphysicians today, but it still amazes us that with all the technology\nand civilization in the galaxy, we Earthmen are the only people yet\ndiscovered who have developed a broad knowledge of the processes of life\nand illness and death.\"\n\nThe old man looked up at his visitor, and Dal felt his pale blue eyes\nsearching his face. \"How badly do you want to be a doctor, Dal?\"\n\n\"More than anything else I know,\" Dal said.\n\n\"Badly enough to do anything to achieve your goal?\"\n\nDal hesitated, and stroked Fuzzy's head gently. \"Well ... almost\nanything.\"\n\nThe Black Doctor nodded. \"And that, of course, is the reason I had to\nsee you before this interview, my friend. I know you've played the game\nstraight right from the beginning, up to this point. Now I beg of you\nnot to do the thing that you are thinking of doing.\"\n\nFor a moment Dal just stared at the little old man in black, and felt\nthe fur on his arms and back rise up. A wave of panic flooded his mind.\n_He knows!_ he thought frantically. _He must be able to read minds!_ But\nhe thrust the idea away. There was no way that the Black Doctor could\nknow. No race of creatures in the galaxy had _that_ power. And yet there\nwas no doubt that Black Doctor Arnquist knew what Dal had been thinking,\njust as surely as if he had said it aloud.\n\nDal shook his head helplessly. \"I ... I don't know what you mean.\"\n\n\"I think you do,\" Doctor Arnquist said. \"Please, Dal. Trust me. This is\nnot the time to lie. The thing that you were planning to do at the\ninterview would be disastrous, even if it won you an assignment. It\nwould be dishonest and unworthy.\"\n\n_Then he does know!_ Dal thought. _But how? I couldn't have told him, or\ngiven him any hint._ He felt Fuzzy give a frightened shiver on his arm,\nand then words were tumbling out of his mouth. \"I don't know what you're\ntalking about, there wasn't anything I was thinking of. I mean, what\ncould I do? If the council wants to assign me to a ship, they will, and\nif they don't, they won't. I don't know what you're thinking of.\"\n\n\"Please.\" Black Doctor Arnquist held up his hand. \"Naturally you defend\nyourself,\" he said. \"I can't blame you for that, and I suppose this is\nan unforgivable breach of diplomacy even to mention it to you, but I\nthink it must be done. Remember that we have been studying and observing\nyour people very carefully over the past two hundred years, Dal. It is\nno accident that you have such a warm attachment to your little pink\nfriend here, and it is no accident that wherever a Garvian is found, his\nFuzzy is with him, isn't that so? And it is no accident that your people\nare such excellent tradesmen, that you are so remarkably skillful in\ndriving bargains favorable to yourselves ... that you are in fact the\nmost powerful single race of creatures in the whole Galactic\nConfederation.\"\n\nThe old man walked to the bookshelves behind him and brought down a\nthick, bound manuscript. He handed it across the desk as Dal watched\nhim. \"You may read this if you like, at your leisure. Don't worry, it's\nnot for publication, just a private study which I have never mentioned\nbefore to anyone, but the pattern is unmistakable. This peculiar talent\nof your people is difficult to describe: not really telepathy, but an\nability to create the emotional responses in others that will be most\nfavorable to you. Just what part your Fuzzies play in this ability of\nyour people I am not sure, but I'm quite certain that without them you\nwould not have it.\"\n\nHe smiled at Dal's stricken face. \"A forbidden topic, eh? And yet\nperfectly true. You know right now that if you wanted to you could\nvirtually paralyze me with fright, render me helpless to do anything but\nstand here and shiver, couldn't you? Or if I were hostile to your\nwishes, you could suddenly force me to sympathize with you and like you\nenormously, until I was ready to agree to anything you wanted--\"\n\n\"No,\" Dal broke in. \"Please, you don't understand! I've never done it,\nnot once since I came to Hospital Earth.\"\n\n\"I know that. I've been watching you.\"\n\n\"And I wouldn't think of doing it.\"\n\n\"Not even at the council interview?\"\n\n\"Never!\"\n\n\"Then let me have Fuzzy now. He is the key to this special talent of\nyour people. Give him to me now, and go to the interview without him.\"\n\nDal drew back, trembling, trying to fight down panic. He brought his\nhand around to the soft fur of the little pink fuzz-ball. \"I ... can't\ndo that,\" he said weakly.\n\n\"Not even if it meant your assignment to a patrol ship?\"\n\nDal hesitated, then shook his head. \"Not even then. But I won't do what\nyou're saying, I promise you.\"\n\nFor a long moment Black Doctor Arnquist stared at him. Then he smiled.\n\"Will you give me your word?\n\n\"Yes, I promise.\"\n\n\"Then I wish you good luck. I will do what I can at the interview. But\nnow there is a bed for you here. You will need sleep if you are to\npresent your best appearance.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nTHE INQUISITION\n\n\nThe interview was held in the main council chambers of Hospital Seattle,\nand Dal could feel the tension the moment he stepped into the room. He\nlooked at the long semicircular table, and studied the impassive faces\nof the four-star Physicians across the table from him.\n\nEach of the major medical services was represented this morning. In the\ncenter, presiding over the council, was a physician of the White\nService, a Four-star Radiologist whose insignia gleamed on his\nshoulders. There were two physicians each, representing the Red Service\nof Surgery, the Green Service of Medicine, the Blue Service of\nDiagnosis, and finally, seated at either end of the table, the\nrepresentatives of the Black Service of Pathology. Black Doctor Thorvold\nArnquist sat to Dal's left; he smiled faintly as the young Garvian\nstepped forward, then busied himself among the papers on the desk before\nhim. To Dal's right sat another Black Doctor who was not smiling.\n\nDal had seen him before--the chief co-ordinator of medical education on\nHospital Earth, the \"Black Plague\" of the medical school jokes. Black\nDoctor Hugo Tanner was large and florid of face, blinking owlishly at\nDal over his heavy horn-rimmed glasses. The glasses were purely\ndecorative; with modern eye-cultures and transplant techniques, no\nEarthman had really needed glasses to correct his vision for the past\ntwo hundred years, but on Hugo Tanner's angry face they added a look of\ngravity and solemnity that the Black Doctor could not achieve without\nthem. Still glaring at Dal, Doctor Tanner leaned over to speak to the\nBlue Doctor on his right, and they nodded and laughed unpleasantly at\nsome private joke.\n\nThere was no place for him to sit, so Dal stood before the table, as\nstraight as his five-foot height would allow him. He had placed Fuzzy\nalmost defiantly on his shoulder, and from time to time he could feel\nthe little creature quiver and huddle against his neck as though to hide\nfrom sight under his collar.\n\nThe White Doctor opened the proceedings, and at first the questions were\nentirely medical. \"We are meeting to consider this student's application\nfor assignment to a General Practice Patrol ship, as a probationary\nphysician in the Red Service of Surgery. I believe you are all\nacquainted with his educational qualifications?\"\n\nThere was an impatient murmur around the table. The White Doctor looked\nup at Dal. \"Your name, please?\"\n\n\"Dal Timgar, sir.\"\n\n\"Your _full_ name,\" Black Doctor Tanner rumbled from the right-hand end\nof the table.\n\nDal took a deep breath and began to give his full Garvian name. It was\nuntranslatable and unpronounceable to Earthmen, who could not reproduce\nthe sequence of pops and whistles that made up the Garvian tongue. The\ndoctors listened, blinking, as the complex family structure and\nancestry which entered into every Garvian's full name continued to roll\nfrom Dal's lips. He was entering into the third generation removed of\nhis father's lineage when Doctor Tanner held up his hand.\n\n\"All right, all right! We will accept the abbreviated name you have used\non Hospital Earth. Let it be clear on the record that the applicant is a\nnative of the second planet of the Garv system.\" The Black Doctor\nsettled back in his chair and began whispering again to the Blue Doctor\nnext to him.\n\nA Green Doctor cleared his throat. \"Doctor Timgar, what do you consider\nto be the basic principle that underlies the work and services of\nphysicians of Hospital Earth?\"\n\nIt was an old question, a favorite on freshman medical school\nexaminations. \"The principle that environments and life forms in the\nuniverse may be dissimilar, but that biochemical reactions are universal\nthroughout creation,\" Dal said slowly.\n\n\"Well memorized,\" Black Doctor Tanner said sourly. \"What does it mean?\"\n\n\"It means that the principles of chemistry, physiology, pathology and\nthe other life sciences, once understood, can be applied to any living\ncreature in the universe, and will be found valid,\" Dal said. \"As\ndifferent as the various life forms may be, the basic life processes in\none life form are the same, under different conditions, as the life\nprocesses in any other life form, just as hydrogen and oxygen will\ncombine to form water anywhere in the universe where the proper physical\nconditions prevail.\"\n\n\"Very good, very good,\" the Green Doctor said. \"But tell me this: what\nin your opinion is the place of surgery in a Galactic practice of\nmedicine?\"\n\nA more difficult question, but one that Dal's training had prepared him\nwell to answer. He answered it, and faced another question, and another.\nOne by one, the doctors interrogated him, Black Doctor Arnquist among\nthem. The questions came faster and faster; some were exceedingly\ndifficult. Once or twice Dal was stopped cold, and forced to admit that\nhe did not know the answer. Other questions which he knew would stop\nother students happened to fall in fields he understood better than\nmost, and his answers were full and succinct.\n\nBut finally the questioning tapered off, and the White Doctor shuffled\nhis papers impatiently. \"If there are no further medical questions, we\ncan move on to another aspect of this student's application. Certain\nquestions of policy have been raised. Black Doctor Tanner had some\nthings to say, I believe, as co-ordinator of medical education.\"\n\nThe Black Doctor rose ponderously to his feet. \"I have some things to\nsay, you can be sure of that,\" he said, \"but they have nothing to do\nwith this Dal Timgar's educational qualifications for assignment to a\nGeneral Practice Patrol ship.\" Black Doctor Tanner paused to glare in\nDal's direction. \"He has been trained in a medical school on Hospital\nEarth, and apparently has passed his final qualifying examinations for\nthe Red Service of Surgery. I can't argue about that.\"\n\nBlack Doctor Arnquist's voice came across the room. \"Then why are we\nhaving his review, Hugo? Dal Timgar's classmates all received their\nassignments automatically.\"\n\n\"Because there are other things to consider here than educational\nqualifications,\" Hugo Tanner said. \"Gentlemen, consider our position for\na moment. We have thousands of probationary physicians abroad in the\ngalaxy at the present time, fine young men and women who have been\ntrained in medical schools on Hospital Earth, and now are gaining\nexperience and judgment while fulfilling our medical service contracts\nin every part of the confederation. They are probationers, but we must\nnot forget that we physicians of Hospital Earth are also probationers.\nWe are seeking a permanent place in this great Galactic Confederation,\nwhich was in existence many thousands of years before we even knew of\nits existence. It was not until our own scientists discovered the Koenig\nstar-drive, enabling us to break free of our own solar system, that we\nwere met face to face with a confederation of intelligent races\ninhabiting the galaxy--among others, the people from whom this same Dal\nTimgar has come.\"\n\n\"The history is interesting,\" Black Doctor Arnquist broke in, \"but\nreally, Hugo, I think most of us know it already.\"\n\n\"Maybe we do,\" Doctor Tanner said, flushing a little. \"But the history\nis significant. Permanent membership in the confederation is contingent\non two qualifications. First, we must have developed a star-drive of our\nown, a qualification of intelligence, if you will. The confederation has\nruled that only races having a certain level of intelligence can become\nmembers. A star-drive could only be developed with a far-reaching\nunderstanding of the physical sciences, so this is a valid criterion of\nintelligence. But the second qualification for confederation membership\nis nothing more nor less than a question of usefulness.\"\n\nThe presiding White Doctor looked up, frowning. \"Usefulness?\"\n\n\"Exactly. The Galactic Confederation, with its exchange of ideas and\ntalents, and all the wealth of civilization it has to offer, is based on\na division of labor. Every member must have something to contribute,\nsome special talent. For Earthmen, the talent was obvious very early.\nOur technology was primitive, our manufacturing skills mediocre, our\ntransport and communications systems impossible. But in our\nunderstanding of the life sciences, we have far outstripped any other\nrace in the galaxy. We had already solved the major problems of disease\nand longevity among our own people, while some of the most advanced\nraces in the confederation were being reduced to helplessness by cyclic\nplagues which slaughtered their populations, and were caused by nothing\nmore complex than a simple parasitic virus. Garv II is an excellent\nexample.\"\n\nOne of the Red Doctors cleared his throat. \"I'm afraid I don't quite see\nthe connection. Nobody is arguing about our skill as doctors.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" Black Doctor Tanner said. \"The point is that in all the\ngalaxy, Earthmen are by their very nature the _best_ doctors,\noutstripping the most advanced physicians on any other planet. And this,\ngentlemen, is our bargaining point. We are useful to the Galactic\nConfederation only as physicians. The confederation needed us badly\nenough to admit us to probational membership, but if we ever hope to\nbecome full members of the confederation, we must demonstrate our\nusefulness, our unique skill, as physicians. We have worked hard to\nprove ourselves. We have made Hospital Earth the galactic center of\nstudy and treatment of diseases of many races. Earthmen on the General\nPractice Patrol ships visit planets in the remotest sections, and their\nreputation as physicians has grown. Every year new planets are writing\nfull medical service contracts with us ... as Earthmen serving the\ngalaxy--\"\n\n\"As _physicians_ serving the galaxy,\" Black Doctor Arnquist's voice shot\nacross the room.\n\n\"As far as the confederation has been concerned, the two have been\nsynonymous,\" Hugo Tanner roared. \"_Until now._ But now we have an alien\namong us. We have allowed a non-Earthman to train in our medical\nschools. He has completed the required work, his qualifications are\nacceptable, and now he proposes to go out on a patrol ship as a\nphysician of the Red Service of Surgery. But think of what you are doing\nif you permit him to go! You will be proving to every planet in the\nconfederation that they don't really need Earthmen after all, that any\nrace from any planet might produce physicians just as capable as\nEarthmen.\"\n\nThe Black Doctor turned slowly to face Dal, his mouth set in a grim\nline. As he talked, his face had grown dark with anger. \"Understand that\nI have nothing against this creature as an individual. Perhaps he would\nprove to be a competent physician, although I cannot believe it. Perhaps\nhe would carry on the traditions of medical service we have worked so\nlong to establish, although I doubt it. But I do know that if we permit\nhim to become a qualified physician, it will be the beginning of the end\nfor Hospital Earth. We will be selling out our sole bargaining position.\nWe can forget our hopes for membership in the confederation, because one\nlike him this year will mean two next year, and ten the next, and there\nwill be no end to it. We should have stopped it eight years ago, but\ncertain ones prevailed to admit Dal Timgar to training. If we do not\nstop it now, for all time, we will never be able to stop it.\"\n\nSlowly the Black Doctor sat down, motioning to an orderly at the rear of\nthe room. The orderly brought a glass of water and a small capsule which\nBlack Doctor Tanner gulped down. The other doctors were talking heatedly\namong themselves as Black Doctor Arnquist rose to his feet. \"Then you\nare claiming that our highest calling is to keep medicine in the hands\nof Earthmen alone?\" he asked softly.\n\nDoctor Tanner flushed. \"Our highest calling is to provide good medical\ncare for our patients,\" he said.\n\n\"The best possible medical care?\"\n\n\"I never said otherwise.\"\n\n\"And yet you deny the ancient tradition that a physician's duty is to\nhelp his patients help themselves,\" Black Doctor Arnquist said.\n\n\"I said no such thing!\" Hugo Tanner cried, jumping to his feet. \"But we\nmust protect ourselves. We have no other power, nothing else to sell.\"\n\n\"And I say that if we must sell our medical skill for our own benefit\nfirst, then we are not worthy to be physicians to anyone,\" Doctor\nArnquist snapped. \"You make a very convincing case, but if we examine it\nclosely, we see that it amounts to nothing but fear and selfishness.\"\n\n\"Fear?\" Doctor Tanner cried. \"What do we have to fear if we can maintain\nour position? But if we must yield to a Garvian who has no business in\nmedicine in the first place, what can we have left but fear?\"\n\n\"If I were really convinced that Earthmen were the best physicians in\nthe galaxy,\" Black Doctor Arnquist replied, \"I don't think I'd have to\nbe afraid.\"\n\nThe Black Doctor at the end of the table stood up, shaking with rage.\n\"Listen to him!\" he cried to the others. \"Once again he is defending\nthis creature and turning his back on common sense. All I ask is that we\nkeep our skills among our own people and avoid the contamination that\nwill surely result--\"\n\nDoctor Tanner broke off, his face suddenly white. He coughed, clutching\nat his chest, and sank down groping for his medicine box and the water\nglass. After a moment he caught his breath and shook his head. \"There's\nnothing more I can say,\" he said weakly. \"I have done what I could, and\nthe decision is up to the rest of you.\" He coughed again, and slowly the\ncolor came back into his face. The Blue Doctor had risen to help him,\nbut Tanner waved him aside. \"No, no, it's nothing. I allowed myself to\nbecome angry.\"\n\nBlack Doctor Arnquist spread his hands. \"Under the circumstances, I\nwon't belabor the point,\" he said, \"although I think it would be good if\nDoctor Tanner would pause in his activities long enough for the surgery\nthat would make his anger less dangerous to his own life. But he\nrepresents a view, and his right to state it is beyond reproach.\" Doctor\nArnquist looked from face to face along the council table. \"The decision\nis yours, gentlemen, I would ask only that you consider what our highest\ncalling as physicians really is--a duty that overrides fear and\nselfishness. I believe Dal Timgar would be a good physician, and that\nthis is more important than the planet of his origin. I think he would\nuphold the honor of Hospital Earth wherever he went, and give us his\nloyalty as well as his service. I will vote to accept his application,\nand thus cancel out my colleague's negative vote. The deciding votes\nwill be cast by the rest of you.\"\n\nHe sat down, and the White Doctor looked at Dal Timgar. \"It would be\ngood if you would wait outside,\" he said. \"We will call you as soon as a\ndecision is reached.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDal waited in an anteroom, feeding Fuzzy and trying to put out of his\nmind for a moment the heated argument still raging in the council\nchamber. Fuzzy was quivering with fright; unable to speak, the tiny\ncreature nevertheless clearly experienced emotions, even though Dal\nhimself did not know how he received impressions, nor why.\n\nBut Dal knew that there was a connection between the tiny pink\ncreature's emotions and the peculiar talent that Black Doctor Arnquist\nhad spoken of the night before. It was not a telepathic power that Dal\nand his people possessed. Just _what_ it was, was difficult to define,\nyet Dal knew that every Garvian depended upon it to some extent in\ndealing with people around him. He knew that when Fuzzy was sitting on\nhis arm he could sense the emotions of those around him--the anger, the\nfear, the happiness, the suspicion--and he knew that under certain\ncircumstances, in a way he did not clearly understand, he could wilfully\nchange the feelings of others toward himself. Not a great deal, perhaps,\nnor in any specific way, but just enough to make them look upon him and\nhis wishes more favorably than they otherwise might.\n\nThroughout his years on Hospital Earth he had vigilantly avoided using\nthis strange talent. Already he was different enough from Earthmen in\nappearance, in ways of thinking, in likes and dislikes. But these\ndifferences were not advantages, and he had realized that if his\nclassmates had ever dreamed of the advantage that he had, minor as it\nwas, his hopes of becoming a physician would have been destroyed\ncompletely.\n\nAnd in the council room he had kept his word to Doctor Arnquist. He had\nfelt Fuzzy quivering on his shoulder; he had sensed the bitter anger in\nBlack Doctor Tanner's mind, and the temptation deliberately to mellow\nthat anger had been almost overwhelming, but he had turned it aside. He\nhad answered questions that were asked him, and listened to the debate\nwith a growing sense of hopelessness.\n\nAnd now the chance was gone. The decision was being made.\n\nHe paced the floor, trying to remember the expressions of the other\ndoctors, trying to remember what had been said, how many had seemed\nfriendly and how many hostile, but he knew that only intensified the\ntorture. There was nothing he could do now but wait.\n\nAt last the door opened, and an orderly nodded to him. Dal felt his legs\ntremble as he walked into the room and faced the semi-circle of doctors.\nHe tried to read the answer on their faces, but even Black Doctor\nArnquist sat impassively, doodling on the pad before him, refusing to\nmeet Dal's eyes.\n\nThe White Doctor took up a sheet of paper. \"We have considered your\napplication, and have reached a decision. You will be happy to know that\nyour application for assignment has been tentatively accepted.\"\n\nDal heard the words, and it seemed as though the room were spinning\naround him. He wanted to shout for joy and throw his arms around Black\nDoctor Arnquist, but he stood perfectly still, and suddenly he noticed\nthat Fuzzy was very quiet on his shoulder.\n\n\"You will understand that this acceptance is not irrevocable,\" the White\nDoctor went on. \"We are not willing to guarantee your ultimate\nacceptance as a fully qualified Star Surgeon at this point. You will be\nallowed to wear a collar and cuff, uniform and insignia of a\nprobationary physician, in the Red Service, and will be assigned aboard\nthe General Practice Patrol ship _Lancet_, leaving from Hospital Seattle\nnext Tuesday. If you prove your ability in that post, your performance\nwill once again be reviewed by this board, but you alone will determine\nour decision then. Your final acceptance as a Star Surgeon will depend\nentirely upon your conduct as a member of the patrol ship's crew.\" He\nsmiled at Dal, and set the paper down. \"The council wishes you well. Do\nyou have any questions?\"\n\n\"Just one,\" Dal managed to say. \"Who will my crewmates be?\"\n\n\"As is customary, a probationer from the Green Service of Medicine and\none from the Blue Service of Diagnosis. Both have been specially\nselected by this council. Your Blue Doctor will be Jack Alvarez, who has\nshown great promise in his training in diagnostic medicine.\"\n\n\"And the Green Doctor?\"\n\n\"A young man named Frank Martin,\" the White Doctor said. \"Known to his\nfriends, I believe, as 'Tiger.'\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\nTHE GALACTIC PILL PEDDLERS\n\n\nThe ship stood tall and straight on her launching pad, with the\nafternoon sunlight glinting on her hull. Half a dozen crews of check-out\nmen were swarming about her, inspecting her engine and fuel supplies,\nriding up the gantry crane to her entrance lock, and guiding the great\ncargo nets from the loading crane into her afterhold. High up on her\nhull Dal Timgar could see a golden caduceus emblazoned, the symbol of\nthe General Practice Patrol, and beneath it the ship's official name:\n\n      GPPS 238\n      _LANCET_\n\nDal shifted his day pack down from his shoulders, ridiculously pleased\nwith the gleaming scarlet braid on the collar and cuff of his uniform,\nand lifted Fuzzy up on his shoulder to see. It seemed to Dal that\neveryone he had passed in the terminal had been looking at the colorful\ninsignia; it was all he could do to keep from holding his arm up and\nwaving it like a banner.\n\n\"You'll get used to it,\" Tiger Martin chuckled as they waited for the\njitney to take them across to the launching pad. \"At first you think\neverybody is impressed by the colors, until you see some guy go past\nwith the braid all faded and frazzled at the edges, and then you realize\nthat you're just the latest greenhorn in a squad of two hundred thousand\nmen.\"\n\n\"It's still good to be wearing it,\" Dal said. \"I couldn't really believe\nit until Black Doctor Arnquist turned the collar and cuff over to me.\"\nHe looked suspiciously at Tiger. \"You must have known a lot more about\nthat interview than you let on. Or, was it just coincidence that we were\nassigned together?\"\n\n\"Not coincidence, exactly.\" Tiger grinned. \"I didn't know what was going\nto happen. I'd requested assignment with you on my application, and then\nwhen yours was held up, Doctor Arnquist asked me if I'd be willing to\nwait for assignment until the interview was over. So I said okay. He\nseemed to think you had a pretty good chance.\"\n\n\"I'd never have made it without his backing,\" Dal said.\n\n\"Well, anyway, he figured that if you _were_ assigned, it would be a\ngood idea to have a friend on the patrol ship team.\"\n\n\"I won't argue about _that_,\" Dal said. \"But who is the Blue Service\nman?\"\n\nTiger's face darkened. \"I don't know much about him,\" he said. \"He\ntrained in California, and I met him just once, at a diagnosis and\ntherapy conference. He's supposed to be plenty smart, according to the\ngrapevine. I guess he'd have to be, to pass Diagnostic Service finals.\"\nTiger chuckled. \"Any dope can make it in the Medical or Surgical\nServices, but diagnosis is something else again.\"\n\n\"Will he be in command?\"\n\n\"On the _Lancet_? Why should he? We'll share command, just like any\npatrol ship crew. If we run into problems we can't agree on, we holler\nfor help. But if he acts like most of the Blue Doctors I know, he'll\n_think_ he's in command.\"\n\nA jitney stopped for them, and then zoomed out across the field toward\nthe ship. The gantry platform was just clanging to the ground, unloading\nthree technicians and a Four-bar Electronics Engineer. Tiger and Dal\nrode the platform up again and moments later stepped through the\nentrance lock of the ship that would be their home base for months and\nperhaps years.\n\nThey found the bunk room to the rear of the control and lab sections. A\nduffel bag was already lodged on one of the bunks; one of the foot\nlockers was already occupied, and a small but expensive camera and a\nhuge pair of field glasses were hanging from one of the wall brackets.\n\n\"Looks like our man has already arrived,\" Tiger said, tossing down his\nown duffel bag and looking around the cramped quarters. \"Not exactly a\nluxury suite, I'd say. Wonder where he is?\"\n\n\"Let's look up forward,\" Dal said. \"We've plenty to do before we take\noff. Maybe he's just getting an early start.\"\n\nThey explored the ship, working their way up the central corridor past\nthe communications and computer rooms and the laboratory into the main\ncontrol and observation room. Here they found a thin, dark-haired young\nman in a bright blue collar and cuff, sitting engrossed with a\ntape-reader.\n\nFor a moment they thought he hadn't heard them. Then, as though\nreluctant to tear himself away, the Blue Doctor sighed, snapped off the\nreader, and turned on the swivel stool.\n\n\"So!\" he said. \"I was beginning to wonder if you were ever going to get\nhere.\"\n\n\"We ran into some delays,\" Tiger said. He grinned and held out his hand.\n\"Jack Alvarez? Tiger Martin. We met each other at that conference in\nChicago last year.\"\n\n\"Yes, I remember,\" the Blue Doctor said. \"You found some holes in a\npaper I gave. Matter of fact, I've plugged them up very nicely since\nthen. You'd have trouble finding fault with the work now.\" Jack Alvarez\nturned his eyes to Dal. \"And I suppose this is the Garvian I've been\nhearing about, complete with his little pink stooge.\"\n\nThe moment they had walked in the door, Dal had felt Fuzzy crouch down\ntight against his shoulder. Now a wave of hostility struck his mind like\na shower of ice water. He had never seen this thin, dark-haired youth\nbefore, or even heard of him, but he recognized this sharp impression of\nhatred and anger unmistakably. He had felt it a thousand times among his\nmedical school classmates during the past eight years, and just hours\nbefore he had felt it in the council room when Black Doctor Tanner had\nturned on him.\n\n\"It's really a lucky break that we have Dal for a Red Doctor,\" Tiger\nsaid. \"We almost didn't get him.\"\n\n\"Yes, I heard all about how lucky we are,\" Jack Alvarez said sourly. He\nlooked Dal over from the gray fur on the top of his head to the spindly\nlegs in the ill-fitting trousers. Then the Blue Doctor shrugged in\ndisgust and turned back to the tape-reader. \"A Garvian and his Fuzzy!\"\nhe muttered. \"Let's hope one or the other knows something about\nsurgery.\"\n\n\"I think we'll do all right,\" Dal said slowly.\n\n\"I think you'd better,\" Jack Alvarez replied.\n\nDal and Tiger looked at each other, and Tiger shrugged. \"It's all\nright,\" he said. \"We know our jobs, and we'll manage.\"\n\nDal nodded, and started back for the bunk room. No doubt, he thought,\nthey would manage.\n\nBut if he had thought before that the assignment on the _Lancet_ was\ngoing to be easy, he knew now that he was wrong.\n\nTiger Martin may have been Doctor Arnquist's selection as a crewmate for\nhim, but there was no question in his mind that the Blue Doctor on the\n_Lancet_'s crew was Black Doctor Hugo Tanner's choice.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe first meeting with Jack Alvarez hardly seemed promising to either\nDal or Tiger, but if there was trouble coming, it was postponed for the\nmoment by common consent. In the few days before blast-off there was no\ntime for conflict, or even for much talk. Each of the three crewmen had\ntwo full weeks of work to accomplish in two days; each knew his job and\nburied himself in it with a will.\n\nThe ship's medical and surgical supplies had to be inventoried, and\nmissing or required supplies ordered up. New supplies coming in had to\nbe checked, tested, and stored in the ship's limited hold space. It was\nlike preparing for an extended pack trip into wilderness country; once\nthe _Lancet_ left its home base on Hospital Earth it was a world to\nitself, equipped to support its physician-crew and provide the necessary\nequipment and data they would need to deal with the problems they would\nface. Like all patrol ships, the _Lancet_ was equipped with automatic\nlaunching, navigation and drive mechanisms; no crew other than the\nthree doctors was required, and in the event of mechanical failures,\nmaintenance ships were on continual call.\n\nThe ship was responsible for patrolling an enormous area, including\nhundreds of stars and their planetary systems--yet its territory was\nonly a tiny segment of the galaxy. Landings were to be made at various\nspecified planets maintaining permanent clinic outposts of Hospital\nEarth; certain staple supplies were carried for each of these check\npoints. Aside from these lonely clinic contacts, the nearest port of\ncall for the _Lancet_ was one of the hospital ships that continuously\nworked slow orbits through the star systems of the confederation.\n\nBut a hospital ship, with its staff of Two-star and Three-star\nPhysicians, was not to be called except in cases of extreme need. The\nprobationers on the patrol ships were expected to be self-sufficient.\nTheir job was to handle diagnosis and care of all but the most difficult\nproblems that arose in their travels. They were the first to answer the\nmedical calls from any planet with a medical service contract with\nHospital Earth.\n\nIt was an enormous responsibility for doctors-in-training to assume, but\nover the years it had proven the best way to train and weed out new\ndoctors for the greater responsibilities of hospital ship and Hospital\nEarth assignments. There was no set period of duty on the patrol ships;\nhow long a young doctor remained in the General Practice Patrol depended\nto a large extent upon how well he handled the problems and\nresponsibilities that faced him; and since the first years of Hospital\nEarth, the fledgling doctors in the General Practice Patrol--the\nself-styled \"Galactic Pill Peddlers\"--had lived up to their\nresponsibilities. The reputation of Hospital Earth rested on their\nshoulders, and they never forgot it.\n\nAs he worked on his inventories, Dal Timgar thought of Doctor Arnquist's\nwords to him after the council had handed down its decision. \"Remember\nthat judgment and skill are two different things,\" he had said. \"Without\nskill in the basic principles of diagnosis and treatment, medical\njudgment isn't much help, but skill without the judgment to know how and\nwhen to use it can be downright dangerous. You'll be judged both on the\njudgment you use in deciding the right thing to do, and on the skill you\nuse in doing it.\" He had given Dal the box with the coveted collar and\ncuff. \"The colors are pretty, but never forget what they stand for.\nUntil you can convince the council that you have both the skill and the\njudgment of a good physician, you will never get your Star. And you will\nbe watched closely; Black Doctor Tanner and certain others will be\nwaiting for the slightest excuse to recall you from the _Lancet_. If you\ngive them the opportunity, nothing I can do will stop it.\"\n\nAnd now, as they worked to prepare the ship for service, Dal was\ndetermined that the opportunity would not arise. When he was not working\nin the storerooms, he was in the computer room, reviewing the thousands\nof tapes that carried the basic information about the contract planets\nwhere they would be visiting, and the races that inhabited them. If\nerrors and fumbles and mistakes were made by the crew of the _Lancet_,\nhe thought grimly, it would not be Dal Timgar who made them.\n\nThe first night they met in the control room to divide the many\nextracurricular jobs involved in maintaining a patrol ship.\n\nTiger's interest in electronics and communications made him the best man\nto handle the radio; he accepted the post without comment. \"Jack, you\nshould be in charge of the computer,\" he said, \"because you'll be the\none who'll need the information first. The lab is probably your field\ntoo. Dal can be responsible for stores and supplies as well as his own\nsurgical instruments.\"\n\nJack shrugged. \"I'd just as soon handle supplies, too,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, there's no need to overload one man,\" Tiger said.\n\n\"I wouldn't mind that. But when there's something I need, I want to be\nsure it's going to be there without any goof-ups,\" Jack said.\n\n\"I can handle it all right,\" Dal said.\n\nJack just scowled. \"What about the contact man when we make landings?\"\nhe asked Tiger.\n\n\"Seems to me Dal would be the one for that, too,\" Tiger said. \"His\npeople are traders and bargainers; right, Dal? And first contact with\nthe people on unfamiliar planets can be important.\"\n\n\"It sure can,\" Jack said. \"Too important to take chances with. Look,\nthis is a ship from Hospital Earth. When somebody calls for help, they\nexpect to see an Earthman turn up in response. What are they going to\nthink when a patrol ship lands and _he_ walks out?\"\n\nTiger's face darkened. \"They'll be able to see his collar and cuff,\nwon't they?\"\n\n\"Maybe. But they may wonder what he's doing wearing them.\"\n\n\"Well, they'll just have to learn,\" Tiger snapped. \"And you'll have to\nlearn, too, I guess.\"\n\nDal had been sitting silently. Now he shook his head. \"I think Jack is\nright on this one,\" he said. \"It would be better for one of you to be\ncontact man.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Tiger said angrily. \"You're as much of a doctor from Hospital\nEarth as we are, and the sooner we get your position here straight, the\nbetter. We aren't going to have any ugly ducklings on this ship, and we\naren't going to hide you in the hold every time we land on a planet. If\nwe want to make anything but a mess of this cruise, we've got to work as\na team, and that means everybody shares the important jobs.\"\n\n\"That's fine,\" Dal said, \"but I still think Jack is right on this point.\nIf we are walking into a medical problem on a planet where the patrol\nisn't too well known, the contact man by rights ought to be an\nEarthman.\"\n\nTiger started to say something, and then spread his hands helplessly.\n\"Okay,\" he said. \"If you're satisfied with it, let's get on to these\nother things.\" But obviously he wasn't satisfied, and when Jack\ndisappeared toward the storeroom, Tiger turned to Dal. \"You shouldn't\nhave given in,\" he said. \"If you give that guy as much as an inch,\nyou're just asking for trouble.\"\n\n\"It isn't a matter of giving in,\" Dal insisted. \"I think he was right,\nthat's all. Don't let's start a fight where we don't have to.\"\n\nTiger yielded the point, but when Jack returned, Tiger avoided him,\nkeeping to himself the rest of the evening. And later, as he tried to\nget to sleep, Dal wondered for a moment. Maybe Tiger was right. Maybe he\nwas just dodging a head-on clash with the Blue Doctor now and setting\nthe stage for a real collision later.\n\nNext day the argument was forgotten in the air of rising excitement as\nembarkation orders for the _Lancet_ came through. Preparations were\ncompleted, and only last-minute double-checks were required before\nblast-off.\n\nBut an hour before count-down began, a jitney buzzed across the field,\nand a Two-star Pathologist climbed aboard with his three black-cloaked\norderlies. \"Shakedown inspection,\" he said curtly. \"Just a matter of\nroutine.\" And with that he stalked slowly through the ship, checking the\nstorage holds, the inventories, the lab, the computer with its\ninformation banks, and the control room. As he went along he kept firing\nmedical questions at Dal and Tiger, hardly pausing long enough for the\nanswers, and ignoring Jack Alvarez completely. \"What's the normal range\nof serum cholesterol in a vegetarian race with Terran environment? How\nwould you run a Wenberg electrophoresis? How do you determine individual\nradiation tolerance? How would you prepare a heart culture for cardiac\ntransplant on board this ship?\" The questions went on until Tiger and\nDal were breathless, as count-down time grew closer and closer. Finally\nthe Black Doctor turned back toward the entrance lock. He seemed vaguely\ndisappointed as he checked the record sheets the orderlies had been\nkeeping. With an odd look at Dal, he shrugged. \"All right, here are your\nclearance papers,\" he said to Jack. \"Your supply of serum globulin\nfractions is up to black-book requirements, but you'll run short if you\nhappen to hit a virus epidemic; better take on a couple of more cases.\nAnd check central information just before leaving. We've signed two new\ncontracts in the past week, and the co-ordinator's office has some\nadvance information on both of them.\"\n\nWhen the inspector had gone, Tiger wiped his forehead and sighed. \"That\nwas no routine shakedown!\" he said. \"What _is_ a Wenberg\nelectrophoresis?\"\n\n\"A method of separating serum proteins,\" Jack Alvarez said. \"You ran\nthem in third year biochemistry. And if we _do_ hit a virus epidemic,\nyou'd better know how, too.\"\n\nHe gave Tiger an unpleasant smile, and started back down the corridor as\nthe count-down signal began to buzz.\n\nBut for all the advance arrangements they had made to divide the ship's\nwork, it was Dal Timgar who took complete control of the _Lancet_ for\nthe first two weeks of its cruise. Neither Tiger nor Jack challenged his\ncommand; not a word was raised in protest. The Earthmen were too sick to\ntalk, much less complain about anything.\n\nFor Dal the blast-off from the port of Seattle and the conversion into\nKoenig star-drive was nothing new. His father owned a fleet of Garvian\ntrading ships that traveled to the far corners of the galaxy by means of\na star-drive so similar to the Koenig engines that only an electronic\nengineer could tell them apart. All his life Dal had traveled on the\noutgoing freighters with his father; star-drive conversion was no\nsurprise to him.\n\nBut for Jack and Tiger, it was their first experience in a star-drive\nship. The _Lancet_'s piloting and navigation were entirely automatic;\nits destination was simply coded into the drive computers, and the ship\nwas ready to leap across light years of space in a matter of hours. But\nthe conversion to star-drive, as the _Lancet_ was wrenched, crew and\nall, out of the normal space-time continuum, was far outside of normal\nhuman experience. The physical and emotional shock of the conversion hit\nJack and Tiger like a sledge hammer, and during the long hours while the\nship was traveling through the time-less, distance-less universe of the\ndrive to the pre-set co-ordinates where it materialized again into\nconventional space-time, the Earthmen were retching violently, too sick\nto budge from the bunk room. It took over two weeks, with stops at half\na dozen contract planets, before Jack and Tiger began to adjust\nthemselves to the frightening and confusing sensations of conversion to\nstar-drive. During this time Dal carried the load of the ship's work\nalone, while the others lay gasping and exhausted in their bunks, trying\nto rally strength for the next shift.\n\nTo his horror, Dal discovered that the first planetary stop-over was\ntraditionally a hazing stop. It had been a well-kept patrol secret; the\noutpost clinic on Tempera VI was waiting eagerly for the arrival of the\nnew \"green\" crew, knowing full well that the doctors aboard would hardly\nbe able to stumble out of their bunks, much less to cope with medical\nproblems. The outpost men had concocted a medical \"crisis\" of staggering\nproportions to present to the _Lancet_'s crew; they were so clearly\ndisappointed to find the ship's Red Doctor in full command of himself\nthat Dal obligingly became violently ill too, and did his best to mimick\nJack and Tiger's floundering efforts to pull themselves together and do\n_something_ about the \"problem\" that suddenly descended upon them.\n\nLater, there was a party and celebration, with music and food, as the\nclinic staff welcomed the pale and shaken doctors into the joke. The\noutpost men plied Dal for the latest news from Hospital Earth. They were\nsurprised to see a Garvian aboard the _Lancet_, but no one at the\noutpost showed any sign of resentment at the scarlet braid on Dal's\ncollar and cuff.\n\nSlowly Jack and Tiger got used to the peculiarities of popping in and\nout of hyperspace. It was said that immunity to star-drive sickness was\nhard to acquire, but lasted a lifetime, and would never again bother\nthem once it was achieved. Bit by bit the Earthmen crept out of their\nshells, to find the ship in order and a busy Dal Timgar relieved and\nhappy to have them aboard again.\n\nFortunately, the medical problems that came to the _Lancet_ in the first\nfew weeks were largely routine. The ship stopped at the specified\ncontact points--some far out near the rim of the galactic\nconstellation, others in closer to the densely star-populated center. At\neach outpost clinic the _Lancet_ was welcomed with open arms. The\noutpost men were hungry for news from home, and happy to see fresh\nsupplies; but they were also glad to review the current medical problems\non their planets with the new doctors, exchanging opinions and arguing\ndiagnosis and therapy into the small hours of the night.\n\nOccasionally calls came in to the ship from contract planets in need of\nhelp. Usually the problems were easy to handle. On Singall III, a tiny\nplanet of a cooling giant star, help was needed to deal with a new\noutbreak of a smallpox-like plague that had once decimated the\npopulation; the disease had finally been controlled after a Hospital\nEarth research team had identified the organism that caused it,\ndetermined its molecular structure, and synthesized an antibiotic that\ncould destroy it without damaging the body of the host. But now a\nflareup had occurred. The _Lancet_ brought in supplies of the\nantibiotic, and Tiger Martin spent two days showing Singallese\nphysicians how to control further outbreaks with modern methods of\nimmunization and antisepsis.\n\nAnother planet called for a patrol ship when a bridge-building disaster\noccurred; one of the beetle-like workmen had been badly crushed under a\nmassive steel girder. Dal spent over eighteen hours straight with the\npatient in the _Lancet_'s surgery, carefully repairing the creature's\ndamaged exoskeleton and grafting new segments of bone for regeneration\nof the hopelessly ruined parts, with Tiger administering anaesthesia and\nJack preparing the grafts from the freezer.\n\nOn another planet Jack faced his first real diagnostic challenge and met\nthe test with flying colors. Here a new cancer-like degenerative disease\nhad been appearing among the natives of the planet. It had never before\nbeen noted. Initial attempts to find a causative agent had all three of\nthe _Lancet_'s crew spending sleepless nights for a week, but Jack's\ncareful study of the pattern of the disease and the biochemical\nreactions that accompanied it brought out the answer: the disease was\ncaused by a rare form of genetic change which made crippling alterations\nin an essential enzyme system. Knowing this, Tiger quickly found a drug\nwhich could be substituted for the damaged enzyme, and the problem was\nsolved. They left the planet, assuring the planetary government that\nlaboratories on Hospital Earth would begin working at once to find a way\nactually to rebuild the damaged genes in the embryonic cells, and thus\nput a permanent end to the disease.\n\nThese were routine calls, the kind of ordinary general medical work that\nthe patrol ships were expected to handle. But the visits to the various\nplanets were welcome breaks in the pattern of patrol ship life. The\n_Lancet_ was fully equipped, but her crew's quarters and living space\nwere cramped. Under the best conditions, the crewmen on patrol ships got\non each other's nerves; on the _Lancet_ there was an additional focus of\ntension that grew worse with every passing hour.\n\nFrom the first Jack Alvarez had made no pretense of pleasure at Dal's\ncompany, but now it seemed that he deliberately sought opportunities to\nannoy him. The thin Blue Doctor's face set into an angry mold whenever\nDal was around. He would get up and leave when Dal entered the control\nroom, and complained loudly and bitterly at minor flaws in Dal's\nshipboard work. Nothing Dal did seemed to please him.\n\nBut Tiger had a worse time controlling himself at the Blue Doctor's digs\nand slights than Dal did. \"It's like living in an armed camp,\" he\ncomplained one night when Jack had stalked angrily out of the bunk\nroom. \"Can't even open your mouth without having him jump down your\nthroat.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Dal said.\n\n\"And he's doing it on purpose.\"\n\n\"Maybe so. But it won't help to lose your temper.\"\n\nTiger clenched a huge fist and slammed it into his palm. \"He's just\ndeliberately picking at you and picking at you,\" he said. \"You can't\ntake that forever. Something's got to break.\"\n\n\"It's all right,\" Dal assured him. \"I just ignore it.\"\n\nBut when Jack began to shift his attack to Fuzzy, Dal could ignore it no\nlonger.\n\nOne night in the control room Jack threw down the report he was writing\nand turned angrily on Dal. \"Tell your friend there to turn the other way\nbefore I lose my temper and splatter him all over the wall,\" he said,\npointing to Fuzzy. \"All he does is sit there and stare at me and I'm\ngetting fed up with it.\"\n\nFuzzy drew himself up tightly, shivering on Dal's shoulder. Dal reached\nup and stroked the tiny creature, and Fuzzy's shoe-button eyes\ndisappeared completely. \"There,\" Dal said. \"Is that better?\"\n\nJack stared at the place the eyes had been, and his face darkened\nsuspiciously. \"Well, what happened to them?\" he demanded.\n\n\"What happened to what?\"\n\n\"To his eyes, you idiot!\"\n\nDal looked down at Fuzzy. \"I don't see any eyes.\"\n\nJack jumped up from the stool. He scowled at Fuzzy as if commanding the\neyes to come back again. All he saw was a small ball of pink fur. \"Look,\nhe's been blinking them at me for a week,\" he snarled. \"I thought all\nalong there was something funny about him. Sometimes he's got legs and\nsometimes he hasn't. Sometimes he looks fuzzy, and other times he hasn't\ngot any hair at all.\"\n\n\"He's a pleomorph,\" Dal said. \"No cellular structure at all, just a\nprotein-colloid matrix.\"\n\nJack glowered at the inert little pink lump. \"Don't be silly,\" he said,\ncurious in spite of himself. \"What holds him together?\"\n\n\"Who knows? I don't. Some kind of electro-chemical cohesive force. The\nonly reason he has 'eyes' is because he thinks I want him to have eyes.\nIf you don't like it, he won't have them any more.\"\n\n\"Well, that's very obliging,\" Jack said. \"But why do you keep him\naround? What good does he do you, anyhow? All he does is eat and drink\nand sleep.\"\n\n\"Does he have to do something?\" Dal said evasively. \"He isn't bothering\nyou. Why pick on him?\"\n\n\"He just seems to worry you an awful lot,\" Jack said unpleasantly.\n\"Let's see him a minute.\" He reached out for Fuzzy, then jerked his\nfinger back with a yelp. Blood dripped from the finger tip.\n\nJack's face slowly went white. \"Why, he--he _bit_ me!\"\n\n\"Yes, and you're lucky he didn't take a finger off,\" Dal said, trembling\nwith anger. \"He doesn't like you any more than I do, and you'll get bit\nevery time you come near him, so you'd better keep your hands to\nyourself.\"\n\n\"Don't worry,\" Jack Alvarez said, \"he won't get another chance. You can\njust get rid of him.\"\n\n\"Not a chance,\" Dal said. \"You leave him alone and he won't bother you,\nthat's all. And the same thing goes for me.\"\n\n\"If he isn't out of here in twelve hours, I'll get a warrant,\" Jack said\ntightly. \"There are laws against keeping dangerous pets on patrol\nships.\"\n\nSomewhere in the main corridor an alarm bell began buzzing. For a\nmoment Dal and Jack stood frozen, glaring at each other. Then the door\nburst open and Tiger Martin's head appeared. \"Hey, you two, let's get\nmoving! We've got a call coming in, and it looks like a tough one. Come\non back here!\"\n\nThey headed back toward the radio room. The signal was coming through\nfrantically as Tiger reached for the pile of punched tape running out on\nthe floor. But as they crowded into the radio room, Dal felt Jack's hand\non his arm. \"If you think I was fooling, you're wrong,\" the Blue Doctor\nsaid through his teeth. \"You've got twelve hours to get rid of him.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\nCRISIS ON MORUA VIII\n\n\nThe three doctors huddled around the teletype, watching as the decoded\nmessage was punched out on the tape. \"It started coming in just now,\"\nTiger said. \"And they've been beaming the signal in a spherical pattern,\napparently trying to pick up the nearest ship they could get. There's\ncertainly some sort of trouble going on.\"\n\nThe message was brief, repeated over and over: REQUIRE MEDICAL AID\nURGENT REPLY AT ONCE. This was followed by the code letters that\ndesignated the planet, its location, and the number of its medical\nservice contract.\n\nJack glanced at the code. \"Morua VIII,\" he said. \"I think that's a grade\nI contract.\" He began punching buttons on the reference panel, and\nseveral screening cards came down the slot from the information bank.\n\"Yes. The eighth planet of a large Sol-type star, the only inhabited\nplanet in the system with a single intelligent race, ursine evolutionary\npattern.\" He handed the cards to Tiger. \"Teddy-bears, yet!\"\n\n\"Mammals?\" Tiger said.\n\n\"Looks like it. And they even hibernate.\"\n\n\"What about the contract?\" Dal asked.\n\n\"Grade I,\" said Tiger. \"And they've had a thorough survey. Moderately\nadvanced in their own medical care, but they have full medical coverage\nany time they think they need it. We'd better get an acknowledgment back\nto them. Jack, get the ship ready to star-jump while Dal starts digging\ninformation out of the bank. If this race has its own doctors, they'd\nonly be hollering for help if they're up against a tough one.\"\n\nTiger settled down with earphones and transmitter to try to make contact\nwith the Moruan planet, while Jack went forward to control and Dal\nstarted to work with the tape reader. There was no argument now, and no\ndissension. The procedure to be followed was a well-established routine:\nacknowledge the call, estimate arrival time, relay the call and response\nto the programmers on Hospital Earth, prepare for star-drive, and start\ngathering data fast. With no hint of the nature of the trouble, their\njob was to get there, equipped with as much information about the planet\nand its people as time allowed.\n\nThe Moruan system was not distant from the _Lancet_'s present location.\nTiger calculated that two hours in Koenig drive would put the ship in\nthe vicinity of the planet, with another hour required for landing\nprocedures. He passed the word on to the others, and Dal began digging\nthrough the mass of information in the tape library on Morua VIII and\nits people.\n\nThere was a wealth of data. Morua VIII had signed one of the first\nmedical service contracts with Hospital Earth, and a thorough medical,\nbiochemical, social and psychological survey had been made on the people\nof that world. Since the original survey, much additional information\nhad been amassed, based on patrol ship reports and dozens of specialty\nstudies that had been done there.\n\nAnd out of this data, a picture of Morua VIII and its inhabitants began\nto emerge.\n\nThe Moruans were moderately intelligent creatures, warm-blooded air\nbreathers with an oxygen-based metabolism. Their planet was cold, with\n17 per cent oxygen and much water vapor in its atmosphere. With its vast\nsnow-fields and great mountain ranges, the planet was a popular resort\narea for oxygen-breathing creatures; most of the natives were engaged in\nsome work related to winter sports. They were well fitted anatomically\nfor their climate, with thick black fur, broad flat hind feet and a\nfour-inch layer of fat between their skin and their vital organs.\n\nSwiftly Dal reviewed the emergency file, checking for common drugs and\nchemicals that were poisonous to Moruans, accidents that were common to\nthe race, and special problems that had been met by previous patrol\nships. The deeper he dug into the mass of data, the more worried he\nbecame. Where should he begin? Searching in the dark, there was no way\nto guess what information would be necessary and what part totally\nuseless.\n\nHe buzzed Tiger. \"Any word on the nature of the trouble?\" he asked.\n\n\"Just got through to them,\" Tiger said. \"Not too much to go on, but\nthey're really in an uproar. Sounds like they've started some kind of\norgan-transplant surgery and their native surgeon got cold feet halfway\nthrough and wants us to bail him out.\" Tiger paused. \"I think this is\ngoing to be your show, Dal. Better check up on Moruan anatomy.\"\n\nIt was better than no information, but not much better. Fuzzy huddled on\nDal's shoulder as if he could sense his master's excitement. Very few\nraces under contract with Hospital Earth ever attempted their own major\nsurgery. If a Moruan surgeon had walked into a tight spot in the\noperating room, it could be a real test of skill to get him--and his\npatient--out of it, even on a relatively simple procedure. But\norgan-transplantation, with the delicate vascular surgery and\nmicro-surgery that it entailed, was never simple. In incompetent hands,\nit could turn into a nightmare.\n\nDal took a deep breath and began running the anatomical atlas tapes\nthrough the reader, checking the critical points of Moruan anatomy.\nOxygen-transfer system, circulatory system, renal filtration system--at\nfirst glance, there was little resemblance to any of the \"typical\"\noxygen-breathing mammals Dal had studied in medical school. But then\nsomething struck a familiar note, and he remembered studying the\npeculiar Moruan renal system, in which the creature's chemical waste\nproducts were filtered from the bloodstream in a series of tubules\npassing across the peritoneum, and re-absorbed into the intestine for\nexcretion. Bit by bit other points of the anatomy came clear, and in\nhalf an hour of intense study Dal began to see how the inhabitants of\nMorua VIII were put together.\n\nSatisfied for the moment, he then pulled the tapes that described the\nMoruans' own medical advancement. What were they doing attempting\norgan-transplantation, anyway? That was the kind of surgery that even\nexperienced Star Surgeons preferred to take aboard the hospital ships,\nor back to Hospital Earth, where the finest equipment and the most\nskilled assistants were available.\n\nThere was a signal buzzer, the two-minute warning before the Koenig\ndrive took over. Dal tossed the tape spools back into the bin for\nrefiling, and went forward to the control room.\n\nJust short of two hours later, the _Lancet_ shifted back to normal\nspace drive, and the cold yellow sun of the Moruan system swam into\nsight in the viewscreen. Far below, the tiny eighth planet glistened\nlike a snowball in the reflection of the sun, with only occasional rents\nin the cloud blanket revealing the ragged surface below. The doctors\nwatched as the ship went into descending orbit, skimming the outer\natmosphere and settling into a landing pattern.\n\nBeneath the cloud blanket, the frigid surface of the planet spread out\nbefore them. Great snow-covered mountain ranges rose up on either side.\nA forty-mile gale howled across the landing field, sweeping clouds of\npowdery snow before it.\n\nA huge gawky vehicle seemed to be waiting for the ship to land; it shot\nout from the huddle of gray buildings almost the moment they touched\ndown. Jack slipped into the furs that he had pulled from stores, and\nwent out through the entrance lock and down the ladder to meet the dark\nfurry creatures that were bundling out of the vehicle below. The\nelectronic language translator was strapped to his chest.\n\nFive minutes later he reappeared, frost forming on his blue collar, his\nface white as he looked at Dal. \"You'd better get down there right\naway,\" he said, \"and take your micro-surgical instruments. Tiger, give\nme a hand with the anaesthesia tanks. They're keeping a patient alive\nwith a heart-lung machine right now, and they can't finish the job. It\nlooks like it might be bad.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Moruan who escorted them across the city to the hospital was a huge\nshaggy creature who left no question of the evolutionary line of his\npeople. Except for the flattened nose, the high forehead and the\nfur-less hand with opposing thumb, he looked for all the world like a\nmammoth edition of the Kodiak bears Dal had seen displayed at the\nnatural history museum in Hospital Philadelphia. Like all creatures with\noxygen-and-water based metabolisms, the Moruans could trace their\nevolutionary line to minute one-celled salt-water creatures; but with\nthe bitter cold of the planet, the first land-creatures to emerge from\nthe primeval swamp of Morua VIII had developed the heavy furs and the\nhibernation characteristics of bear-like mammals. They towered over Dal,\nand even Tiger seemed dwarfed by their immense chest girth and powerful\nshoulders.\n\nAs the surface car hurried toward the hospital, Dal probed for more\ninformation. The Moruan's voice was a hoarse growl which nearly deafened\nthe Earthmen in the confined quarters of the car but Dal with the aid of\nthe translator could piece together what had happened.\n\nMore sophisticated in medical knowledge than most races in the galaxy,\nthe Moruans had learned a great deal from their contact with Hospital\nEarth physicians. They actually did have a remarkable grasp of\nphysiology and biochemistry, and constantly sought to learn more. They\nhad already found ways to grow replacement organs from embryonic grafts,\nthe Moruan said, and by copying the techniques used by the surgeons of\nHospital Earth, their own surgeons had attempted the delicate job of\nreplacing a diseased organ with a new, healthy one in a young male\nafflicted with cancer.\n\nDal looked up at the Moruan doctor. \"What organ were you replacing?\" he\nasked suspiciously.\n\n\"Oh, not the entire organ, just a segment,\" the Moruan said. \"The tumor\nhad caused an obstructive pneumonia--\"\n\n\"Are you talking about a segment of _lung_?\" Dal said, almost choking.\n\n\"Of course. That's where the tumor was.\"\n\nDal swallowed hard. \"So you just decided to replace a segment.\"\n\n\"Yes. But something has gone wrong, we don't know what.\"\n\n\"I see.\" It was all Dal could do to keep from shouting at the huge\ncreature. The Moruans had no duplication of organs, such as Earthmen and\ncertain other races had. A tumor of the lung would mean death ... but\nthe technique of grafting a culture-grown lung segment to a portion of\nnatural lung required enormous surgical skill, and the finest\nmicroscopic instruments that could be made in order to suture together\nthe tiny capillary walls and air tubules. And if one lung were\ndestroyed, a Moruan had no other to take its place. \"Do you have any\nmicro-surgical instruments at all?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" the Moruan rumbled proudly. \"We made them ourselves, just for\nthis case.\"\n\n\"You mean you've never attempted this procedure before?\"\n\n\"This was the first time. We don't know where we went wrong.\"\n\n\"You went wrong when you thought about trying it,\" Dal muttered. \"What\nanaesthesia?\"\n\n\"Oxygen and alcohol vapor.\"\n\nThis was no surprise. With many species, alcohol vapor was more\neffective and less toxic than other anaesthetic gases. \"And you have a\nheart-lung machine?\"\n\n\"The finest available, on lease from Hospital Earth.\"\n\nAll the way through the city Dal continued the questioning, and by the\ntime they reached the hospital he had an idea of the task that was\nfacing him. He knew now that it was going to be bad; he didn't realize\njust how bad until he walked into the operating room.\n\nThe patient was barely alive. Recognizing too late that they were in\nwater too deep for them, the Moruan surgeons had gone into panic, and\nneglected the very fundamentals of physiological support for the\ncreature on the table. Dal had to climb up on a platform just to see the\noperating field; the faithful wheeze of the heart-lung machine that was\nsustaining the creature continued in Dal's ears as he examined the work\nalready done, first with the naked eye, then scanning the operative\nfield with the crude microscopic eyepiece.\n\n\"How long has he been anaesthetized?\" he asked the shaggy operating\nsurgeon.\n\n\"Over eighteen hours already.\"\n\n\"And how much blood has he received?\"\n\n\"A dozen liters.\"\n\n\"Any more on hand?\"\n\n\"Perhaps six more.\"\n\n\"Well, you'd better get it into him. He's in shock right now.\"\n\nThe surgeon scurried away while Dal took another look at the micro\nfield. The situation was bad; the anaesthesia had already gone on too\nlong, and the blood chemistry record showed progressive failure.\n\nHe stepped down from the platform, trying to clear his head and decide\nthe right thing to do.\n\nHe had done micro-surgery before, plenty of it, and he knew the\ntechniques necessary to complete the job, but the thought of attempting\nit chilled him. At best, he was on unfamiliar ground, with a dozen\nfactors that could go wrong. By now the patient was a dreadful risk for\nany surgeon. If he were to step in now, and the patient died, how would\nhe explain not calling for help?\n\nHe stepped out to the scrub room where Tiger was waiting. \"Where's\nJack?\" he said.\n\n\"Went back to the ship for the rest of the surgical pack.\"\n\nDal shook his head. \"I don't know what to do. I think we should get him\nto a hospital ship.\"\n\n\"Is it more than you can handle?\" Tiger said.\n\n\"I could probably do it all right--but I could lose him, too.\"\n\nA frown creased Tiger's face. \"Dal, it would take six hours for a\nhospital ship to get here.\"\n\n\"I know that. But on the other hand....\" Dal spread his hands. He felt\nFuzzy crouching in a tight frightened lump in his pocket. He thought\nagain of the delicate, painstaking microscopic work that remained to be\ndone to bring the new section of lung into position to function, and he\nshook his head. \"Look, these creatures hibernate,\" he said. \"If we could\nget him cooled down enough, we could lighten the anaesthesia and\nmaintain him as is, indefinitely.\"\n\n\"This is up to you,\" Tiger said. \"I don't know anything about surgery.\nIf you think we should just hold tight, that's what we'll do.\"\n\n\"All right. I think we'd better. Have them notify Jack to signal for a\nhospital ship. We'll just try to stick it out.\"\n\nTiger left to pass the word, and Dal went back into the operating room.\nSuddenly he felt as if a great weight had been lifted from his\nshoulders. There would be Three-star Surgeons on a Hospital Ship to\nhandle this; it seemed an enormous relief to have the task out of his\nhands. Yet something was wriggling uncomfortably in the back of his\nmind, a quiet little voice saying _this isn't right, you should be doing\nthis yourself right now instead of wasting precious time...._\n\nHe thrust the thought away angrily and ordered the Moruan physicians to\nbring in ice packs to cool the patient's huge hulk down to hibernation\ntemperatures. \"We're going to send for help,\" Dal told the Moruan\nsurgeon who had met them at the ship. \"This man needs specialized care,\nand we'd be taking too much chance to try to do it this way.\"\n\n\"You mean you're sending for a hospital ship?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Dal said.\n\nThis news seemed to upset the Moruans enormously. They began growling\namong themselves, moving back from the operating table.\n\n\"Then you can't save him?\" the operating surgeon said.\n\n\"I think he can be saved, certainly!\"\n\n\"But we thought you could just step in--\"\n\n\"I could, but that would be taking chances that we don't need to take.\nWe can maintain him until the hospital ship arrives.\"\n\nThe Moruans continued to growl ominously, but Dal brushed past them,\nchecking the vital signs of the patient as his body temperature slowly\ndropped. Tiger had taken over the anaesthesia, keeping the patient under\nas light a dosage of medication as was possible.\n\n\"What's eating them?\" he asked Dal quietly.\n\n\"They don't want a hospital ship here very much,\" Dal said. \"Afraid\nthey'll look like fools all over the Confederation if the word gets out.\nBut that's their worry. Ours is to keep this bruiser alive until the\nship gets here.\"\n\nThey settled back to wait.\n\nIt was an agonizing time for Dal. Even Fuzzy didn't seem to be much\ncomfort. The patient was clearly not doing well, even with the low body\ntemperatures Dal had induced. His blood pressure was sagging, and at one\ntime Tiger sat up sharply, staring at his anaesthesia dials and frowning\nin alarm as the nervous-system reactions flagged. The Moruan physicians\nhovered about, increasingly uneasy as they saw the doctors from Hospital\nEarth waiting and doing nothing. One of them, unable to control himself\nany longer, tore off his sterile gown and stalked angrily out of the\noperating suite.\n\nA dozen times Dal was on the verge of stepping in. It was beginning to\nlook now like a race with time, and precious minutes were passing by. He\ncursed himself inwardly for not taking the bit in his teeth at the\nbeginning and going ahead the best he could; it had been a mistake in\njudgment to wait. Now, as minutes passed into hours it looked more and\nmore like a mistake that was going to cost the life of a patient.\n\nThen there was a murmur of excitement outside the operating room, and\nword came in that another ship had been sighted making landing\nmaneuvers. Dal clenched his fists, praying that the patient would last\nuntil the hospital ship crew arrived.\n\nBut the ship that was landing was not a hospital ship. Someone turned on\na TV scanner and picked up the image of a small ship hardly larger than\na patrol ship, with just two passengers stepping down the ladder to the\nground. Then the camera went close-up. Dal saw the faces of the two men,\nand his heart sank.\n\nOne was a Four-star Surgeon, resplendent in flowing red cape and\nglistening silver insignia. Dal did not recognize the man, but the four\nstars meant that he was a top-ranking physician in the Red Service of\nSurgery.\n\nThe other passenger, gathering his black cloak and hood around him as he\nfaced the blistering wind on the landing field, was Black Doctor Hugo\nTanner.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMoments after the Four-star Surgeon arrived at the hospital, he was\nfully and unmistakably in command of the situation. He gave Dal an icy\nstare, then turned to the Moruan operating surgeon, whom he seemed to\nknow very well. After a short barrage of questions and answers, he\nscrubbed and gowned, and stalked past Dal to the crude Moruan\nmicro-surgical control table.\n\nIt took him exactly fifteen seconds to scan the entire operating field\nthrough the viewer, discussing the anatomy as the Moruan surgeon watched\non a connecting screen. Then, without hesitation, he began manipulating\nthe micro-instruments. Once or twice he murmured something to Tiger at\nthe anaesthesia controls, and occasionally he nodded reassurance to the\nMoruan surgeon. He did not even invite Dal to observe.\n\nTen minutes later he rose from the control table and threw the switch to\nstop the heart-lung machine. The patient took a gasping breath on his\nown, then another and another. The Four-star Surgeon stripped off his\ngown and gloves with a flourish. \"It will be all right,\" he said to the\nMoruan physician. \"An excellent job, Doctor, excellent!\" he said. \"Your\ntechnique was flawless, except for the tiny matter you have just\nobserved.\"\n\nIt was not until they were outside the operating room and beyond earshot\nof the Moruan doctors that the Four-star surgeon turned furiously to\nDal. \"Didn't you even bother to examine the operating field, Doctor?\nWhere did you study surgery? Couldn't you tell that the fools had\npractically finished the job themselves? All that was needed was a\nsimple great-vessel graft, which an untrained idiot could have done\nblindfolded. And for this you call me clear from Hospital Earth!\"\n\nThe surgeon threw down his mask in disgust and stalked away, leaving Dal\nand Tiger staring at each other in dismay.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\nTIGER MAKES A PROMISE\n\n\n\"I think,\" Black Doctor Hugo Tanner said ominously, \"that an explanation\nis in order. I would now like to hear it. And believe me, gentlemen, it\nhad better be a very sensible explanation, too.\"\n\nThe pathologist was sitting in the control room of the _Lancet_, his\nglasses slightly askew on his florid face. He had climbed through the\nentrance lock ten minutes before, shaking snow off his cloak and\nwheezing like a boiler about to explode; now he faced the patrol ship's\ncrew like a small but ominous black thundercloud. Across the room, Jack\nAlvarez was staring through the viewscreen at the blizzard howling\nacross the landing field below, a small satisfied smile on his face,\nwhile Tiger sulked with his hands jammed into his trousers. Dal sat by\nhimself feeling very much alone, with Fuzzy peering discreetly out of\nhis jacket pocket.\n\nHe knew the Black Doctor was speaking to him, but he didn't try to\nreply. He had known from the moment the surgeon came out of the\noperating room that he was in trouble. It was just a matter of time\nbefore he would have to answer for his decision here, and it was even\nsomething of a relief that the moment came sooner rather than later.\n\nAnd the more Dal considered his position, the more indefensible it\nappeared. Time after time he had thought of Dr. Arnquist's words about\njudgment and skill. Without one the other was of little value to a\ndoctor, and whatever his skill as a surgeon might have been in the\nMoruan operating room, he now realized that his judgment had been poor.\nHe had allowed himself to panic at a critical moment, and had failed to\nsee how far the surgery had really progressed. By deciding to wait for\nhelp to arrive instead of taking over at once, he had placed the patient\nin even greater jeopardy than before. In looking back, Dal could see\nclearly that it would have been far better judgment to proceed on his\nown.\n\nBut that was how it looked _now_, not _then_, and there was an old\nsaying that the \"retrospectoscope\" was the only infallible instrument in\nall medicine.\n\nIn any event, the thing was done, and couldn't be changed, and Dal knew\nthat he could only stand on what he had done, right or wrong.\n\n\"Well, I'm waiting,\" Black Doctor Tanner said, scowling at Dal through\nhis thick-rimmed glasses. \"I want to know who was responsible for this\nfiasco, and why it occurred in the first place.\"\n\nDal spread his hands hopelessly. \"What do you want me to say?\" he asked.\n\"I took a careful history of the situation as soon as we arrived here,\nand then I examined the patient in the operating room. I thought the\nsurgery might be over my head, and couldn't see attempting it if a\nhospital ship could be reached in time. I thought the patient could be\nmaintained safely long enough for us to call for help.\"\n\n\"I see,\" the Black Doctor said. \"You've done micro-surgery before?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"And organ transplant work?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nThe Black Doctor opened a folder and peered at it over his glasses. \"As\na matter of fact, you spent two solid years in micro-surgical training\nin Hospital Philadelphia, with all sorts of glowing reports from your\npreceptors about what a flair you had for the work.\"\n\nDal shook his head. \"I--I did some work in the field, yes, but not on\ncritical cases under field conditions.\"\n\n\"You mean that this case required some different kind of technique than\nthe cases you've worked on before?\"\n\n\"No, not really, but--\"\n\n\"But you just couldn't quite shoulder the responsibility the job\ninvolved when you got into a pinch without any help around,\" the Black\nDoctor growled.\n\n\"I just thought it would be safer to wait,\" Dal said helplessly.\n\n\"A good conservative approach,\" Dr. Tanner sneered. \"Of course, you\nrealized that prolonged anaesthesia in itself could threaten that\npatient's life?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"And you saw the patient's condition steadily deteriorating while you\nwaited, did you not?\"\n\n\"It was too late to change my mind then,\" Dal said desperately. \"We'd\nsent for you. We knew that it would be only a matter of hours before you\narrived.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" the Black Doctor said. \"Unfortunately, it takes only seconds\nfor a patient to cross the line between life and death, not hours. And I\nsuppose you would have stood there quietly and allowed him to expire if\nwe had not arrived at the time we did?\"\n\nDal shook his head miserably. There was nothing he could answer to that,\nand he realized it. What could he say? That the situation seemed quite\ndifferent now than it had under pressure in the Moruan operating room?\nThat he would have been blamed just as much if he had gone ahead, and\nthen lost the case? His fingers stole down to Fuzzy's soft warm body for\ncomfort, and he felt the little creature cling closer to his side.\n\nThe Black Doctor looked up at the others. \"Well? What do the rest of you\nhave to say?\"\n\nJack Alvarez shrugged his shoulders. \"I'm not a surgeon,\" he said, \"but\neven I could see that _something_ should be done without delay.\"\n\n\"And what does the Green Doctor think?\"\n\nTiger shrugged. \"We misjudged the situation, that's all. It came out\nfortunately for the patient, why make all this fuss about it?\"\n\n\"Because there are other things at stake than just medical\nconsiderations,\" the Black Doctor shot back. \"This planet has a grade I\ncontract with Hospital Earth. We guarantee them full medical coverage of\nall situations and promise them immediate response to any call for\nmedical help that they may send us. It is the most favorable kind of\ncontract we have; when Morua VIII calls for help they expect their call\nto be answered by expert medical attention, not by inept bungling.\"\n\nThe Black Doctor leafed through the folder in his hands. \"We have built\nour reputation in the Galactic Confederation on this kind of contract,\nand our admission to full membership in the Confederation will\nultimately depend upon how we fulfill our promises. Poor medical\njudgment cannot be condoned under any circumstances--but above all, we\ncannot afford to jeopardize a contract.\"\n\nDal stared at him. \"I--I had no intention of jeopardizing a contract,\"\nhe faltered.\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" the Black Doctor said. \"But you were the doctor on the\nspot, and you were so obviously incompetent to handle the situation that\neven these clumsy Moruan surgeons could see it. Their faith in the\ndoctors from Hospital Earth has been severely shaken. They are even\ntalking of letting their contract lapse at the end of this term.\"\n\nTiger Martin jumped to his feet. \"Doctor Tanner, even Four-star Surgeons\nlose patients sometimes. These people should be glad that the doctor\nthey call has sense enough to call for help if he needs it.\"\n\n\"But no help was needed,\" the Black Doctor said angrily. \"Any\nhalf-decent surgeon would have handled the case. If the Moruans see a\npatrol ship bring in one incompetent doctor, what are they going to\nexpect the next time they have need for help? How can they feel sure\nthat their medical needs are well taken care of?\" He shook his head\ngrimly. \"This is the sort of responsibility that doctors on the patrol\nships are expected to assume. If you call for help where there is need\nfor help, no one will ever complain; but when you turn and run the\nmoment things get tough, you are not fit for patrol ship service.\"\n\nThe Black Doctor turned to Dal Timgar. \"You had ample warning,\" he said.\n\"It was clearly understood that your assignment on this ship depended\nupon the fulfillment of the duties of Red Doctor here, and now at the\nfirst real test you turn and run instead of doing your job. All right.\nYou had your opportunity. You can't complain that we haven't given you a\nchance. According to the conduct code of the General Practice Patrol,\nsection XIV, paragraph 2, any physician in the patrol on probationary\nstatus who is found delinquent in executing his duties may be relieved\nof his assignment at the order of any Black Doctor, or any other\nphysician of four-star rank.\" Doctor Tanner closed the folder with a\nsnap of finality. \"It seems to me that the case is clear. Dal Timgar, on\nthe authority of the Code, I am now relieving you of duty--\"\n\n\"Just a minute,\" Tiger Martin burst out.\n\nThe Black Doctor looked up at him. \"Well?\"\n\n\"This is ridiculous,\" Tiger said. \"Why are you picking on _him_? Or do\nyou mean that you're relieving all three of us?\"\n\n\"Of course I'm not relieving all three of you,\" the Black Doctor\nsnapped. \"You and Dr. Alvarez will remain on duty and conduct the ship's\nprogram without a Red Doctor until a man is sent to replace this\nbungler. That also is provided for in the code.\"\n\n\"But I understood that we were operating as a diagnostic and therapeutic\nteam,\" Tiger protested. \"And I seem to remember something in the code\nabout fixing responsibility before a man can be relieved.\"\n\n\"There's no question where the responsibility lies,\" the Black Doctor\nsaid, his face darkening. \"This was a surgical problem, and Dal Timgar\nmade the decisions. I don't see anything to argue.\"\n\n\"There's plenty to argue,\" Tiger said. \"Dal, don't you see what he's\ntrying to do?\"\n\nAcross the room Dal shook his head wearily. \"You'd better keep out of\nit, Tiger,\" he said.\n\n\"Why should I keep out of it and let you be drummed out of the patrol\nfor something that wasn't even your fault?\" Tiger said. He turned\nangrily to the Black Doctor. \"Dal wasn't the one that wanted the\nhospital ship called,\" he said. \"I was. If you're going to relieve\nsomebody, you'd better make it me.\"\n\nThe Black Doctor pulled off his glasses and glared at Tiger. \"Whatever\nare you talking about?\" he said.\n\n\"Just what I said. We had a conference after he'd examined the patient\nin the operating room, and I insisted that we call the hospital ship.\nWhy, Dal--Dal wanted to go ahead and try to finish the case right then,\nand I wouldn't let him,\" Tiger blundered on. \"I didn't think the patient\ncould take it. I thought that it would be too great a risk with the\nfacilities we had here.\"\n\nDal was staring at Tiger, and he felt Fuzzy suddenly shivering violently\nin his pocket. \"Tiger, don't be foolish--\"\n\nThe Black Doctor slammed the file down on the table again. \"Is this\ntrue, what he's saying?\" he asked Dal.\n\n\"No, not a word of it,\" Dal said. \"I wanted to call the hospital ship.\"\n\n\"Of course he won't admit it,\" Tiger said angrily. \"He's afraid you'll\nkick me out too, but it's true just the same in spite of what he says.\"\n\n\"And what do _you_ say?\" the Black Doctor said, turning to Jack Alvarez.\n\n\"I say it's carrying this big brother act too far,\" Jack said. \"I didn't\nnotice any conferences going on.\"\n\n\"You were back at the ship getting the surgical pack,\" Tiger said. \"You\ndidn't know anything about it. You didn't hear us talking, and we didn't\nsee any reason to consult you about it.\"\n\nThe Black Doctor stared from Dal to Tiger, his face growing angrier by\nthe minute. He jerked to his feet, and stalked back and forth across the\ncontrol room, glaring at them. Then he took a capsule from his pocket,\ngulped it down with some water, and sat back down. \"I ought to throw\nyou both out on your ears,\" he snarled. \"But I am forced to control\nmyself. I mustn't allow myself to get angry--\" He crashed his fist down\non the control panel. \"I suppose that you would swear to this statement\nof yours if it came to that?\" he asked Tiger.\n\nTiger nodded and swallowed hard. \"Yes, sir, I certainly would.\"\n\n\"All right,\" the Black Doctor said tightly. \"Then you win this one. The\ncode says that two opinions can properly decide any course of action. If\nyou insist that two of you agreed on this decision, then I am forced to\nsupport you officially. I will make a report of the incident to patrol\nheadquarters, and it will go on the permanent records of all three of\nthis ship's crew--including my personal opinion of the decision.\" He\nlooked up at Dal. \"But be very careful, my young friend. Next time you\nmay not have a technicality to back you up, and I'll be watching for the\nfirst plausible excuse to break you, and your Green Doctor friend as\nwell. One misstep, and you're through. And I assure you that is not just\nan idle threat. I mean every word of it.\"\n\nAnd trembling with rage, the Black Doctor picked up the folder, wrapped\nhis cape around him, and marched out of the control room.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Well, you put on a great show,\" Jack Alvarez said later as they\nprepared the ship for launching from the snow-swept landing field on\nMorua VIII. An hour before the ground had trembled as the Black Doctor's\nship took off with Dr. Tanner and the Four-star Surgeon aboard; now Jack\nbroke the dark silence in the _Lancet_'s control room for the first\ntime. \"A really great show. You missed your calling, Tiger. You should\nhave been on the stage. If you think you fooled Dr. Tanner with that\nstory for half a second, you're crazy, but I guess you got what you\nwanted. You kept your pal's cuff and collar for him, and you put a black\nmark on all of our records, including mine. I hope you're satisfied.\"\n\nTiger Martin took off his earphones and set them carefully on the\ncontrol panel. \"You know,\" he said to Jack, \"you're lucky.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"You're lucky I don't wipe that sneer off your face and scrub the walls\nwith it. And you'd better not crowd your luck, because all I need right\nnow is an invitation.\" He stood up, towering over the dark-haired Blue\nDoctor. \"You bet I'm satisfied. And if you got a black mark along with\nthe rest of us, you earned it all the way.\"\n\n\"That still doesn't make it right,\" Dal said from across the room.\n\n\"You just keep out of this for a minute,\" Tiger said. \"Jack has got to\nget a couple of things straight, and this is the time for it right now.\"\n\nDal shook his head. \"I can't keep out of it,\" he said. \"You got me off\nthe hook by shifting the blame, but you put yourself in trouble doing\nit. Dr. Tanner could just as well have thrown us both out of the service\nas not.\"\n\nTiger snorted. \"On what grounds? For a petty little error like this? He\nwouldn't dare! You ought to read the log books of some of the other GPP\nships some time and see the kind of bloopers they pull without even a\nreprimand. Don't worry, he was mad enough to throw us both out if he\nthought he could make it stick, but he knew he couldn't. He knew the\ncouncil would just review the case and reverse his decision.\"\n\n\"It was still my error, not yours,\" Dal protested. \"I should have gone\nahead and finished the case on the spot. I knew it at the time, and I\njust didn't quite dare.\"\n\n\"So you made a mistake,\" Tiger said. \"You'll make a dozen more before\nyou get your Star, and if none of them amount to any more than this one,\nyou can be very happy.\" He scowled at Jack. \"It's only thanks to our\nfriend here that the Black Doctor heard about this at all. A hospital\nship would have come to take the patient aboard, and the local doctors\nwould have been quieted down and that would have been all there was to\nit. This business about losing a contract is a lot of nonsense.\"\n\n\"Then you think this thing was just used as an excuse to get at me?\"\n\n\"Ask him,\" Tiger said, looking at Jack again. \"Ask him why a Black\nDoctor and a Four-star Surgeon turned up when we just called for a\nhospital ship.\"\n\n\"I called the hospital ship,\" Jack said sullenly.\n\n\"But you called Dr. Tanner too,\" said Tiger. \"Your nose has been out of\njoint ever since Dal came aboard this ship. You've made things as\nmiserable for him as you could, and you just couldn't wait for a chance\nto come along to try to scuttle him.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Jack said, \"but he was making a mistake. Anybody could see\nthat. What if the patient had died while he was standing around waiting?\nIsn't that important?\"\n\nTiger started to answer, and then threw up his hands in disgust. \"It's\nimportant--but something else is more important. We've got a job to do\non this ship, and we can't do it fighting each other. Dal misjudged a\ncase and got in trouble. Fine, he won't make that mistake again. It\ncould just as well have been you, or me. We'll all make mistakes, but if\nwe can't work as a team, we're sunk. We'll all be drummed out of the\npatrol before a year is out.\" Tiger stopped to catch his breath, his\nface flushed with anger. \"Well, I'm fed up with this back-stabbing\nbusiness. I don't want a fight any more than Dal does, but if I have to\nfight, I'll fight to get it over with, and you'd better be careful. If\nyou pull any more sly ones, you'd better include me in the deal, because\nif Dal goes, I go too. And that's a promise.\"\n\nThere was silence for a moment as Jack stared up at Tiger's angry face.\nHe shook his head and blinked, as though he couldn't quite believe what\nhe was hearing. He looked across at Dal, and then back at Tiger again.\n\"You mean you'd turn in your collar and cuff?\" he said.\n\n\"If it came to that.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Jack sat down at the control panel, still shaking his head. \"I\nthink you really mean it,\" he said soberly. \"This isn't just a big\nbrother act. You really like the guy, don't you?\"\n\n\"Maybe I do,\" Tiger said, \"but I don't like to watch anybody get kicked\naround just because somebody else doesn't happen to like him.\"\n\nThe control room was very quiet. Then somewhere below a motor clicked\non, and the ventilation fan made a quiet whirring sound. The teletype\nclicked sporadically down the corridor in the communications room. Dal\nsat silently, rubbing Fuzzy between the eyes and watching the two\nEarthmen. It seemed suddenly as if they were talking about somebody a\nmillion miles away, as if he were not even in the room.\n\nThen the Blue Doctor shrugged and rose to his feet. \"All right,\" he said\nto Tiger. \"I guess I just didn't understand where you stood, and I\nsuppose it wasn't my job to let the Black Doctor know about the\nsituation here. I don't plan to be making all the mistakes you think\nwe're going to make, and I won't take the blame for anybody else's, but\nI guess we've got to work together in the tight spots.\" He gave Dal a\nlop-sided grin. \"Welcome aboard,\" he said. \"We'd better get this crate\nairborne before the people here come and cart it away.\"\n\nThey moved then, and the subject was dropped. Half an hour later the\n_Lancet_ lifted through the atmospheric pull of the Moruan planet and\nmoved on toward the next contact point, leaving the recovering patient\nin the hands of the native physicians. It was not until hours later that\nDal noticed that Fuzzy had stopped quivering, and was resting happily\nand securely on his shoulder even when the Blue Doctor was near.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\nALARUMS AND EXCURSIONS\n\n\nOnce more the crew of the _Lancet_ settled down to routine, and the\nincident on Morua VIII seemed almost forgotten.\n\nBut a change had come about in the relations between the three doctors,\nand in every way the change was for the better. If Jack Alvarez was not\nexactly cordial to Dal Timgar, at least he had dropped the open\nantagonism that he had shown before. Apparently Tiger's angry outburst\nhad startled Jack, as though he had never really considered that the big\nEarthman might honestly be attached to his friend from Garv II, and the\nBlue Doctor seemed sincere in his agreement to work with Dal and Tiger\nas a team.\n\nBut bit by bit Dal could sense that the change in Jack's attitude went\ndeeper than the surface. \"You know, I really think he was _scared_ of\nme,\" Dal said one night when he and Tiger were alone. \"Sounds silly, but\nI think it's true. He pretends to be so sure of himself, but I think\nhe's as worried about doing things wrong as we are, and just won't admit\nit. And he really thought I was a threat when I came aboard.\"\n\n\"He probably had a good thorough briefing from Black Doctor Tanner\nbefore he got the assignment,\" Tiger said grimly.\n\n\"Maybe--but somehow I don't think he cares for the Black Doctor much\nmore than we do.\"\n\nBut whatever the reason, much of the tension was gone when the _Lancet_\nhad left the Moruan system behind. A great weight seemed to have been\nlifted, and if there was not quite peace on board, at least there was an\nuneasy truce. Tiger and Jack were almost friendly, talking together more\noften and getting to know each other better. Jack still avoided Dal and\nseldom included him in conversations, but the open contempt of the first\nfew weeks on the ship now seemed tempered somewhat.\n\nOnce again the _Lancet_'s calls fell into a pattern. Landings on the\noutpost planets became routine, bright spots in a lonely and wandering\nexistence. The calls that came in represented few real problems. The\nship stopped at one contract planet to organize a mass inoculation\nprogram against a parasitic infestation resembling malaria. They paused\nat another place to teach the native doctors the use of some new\nsurgical instruments that had been developed in Hospital Earth\nlaboratories just for them. Frantic emergency calls usually proved to\ninvolve trivial problems, but once or twice potentially serious\nsituations were spotted early, before they could develop into real\ntrouble.\n\nAnd as the three doctors got used to the responsibilities of a patrol\nship's rounds, and grew more confident of their ability to handle the\nproblems thrust upon them, they found themselves working more and more\nefficiently as a team.\n\nThis was the way the General Practice Patrol was supposed to function.\nEach doctor had unsuspected skills that came to light. There was no\nquestioning Jack Alvarez's skill as a diagnostician, but it seemed\nuncanny to Dal the way the slender, dark-haired Earthman could listen\ncarefully to a medical problem of an alien race on a remote planet, and\nthen seem to know exactly which questions to ask to draw out the\nsignificant information about the situation. Tiger was not nearly as\nquick and clever as Jack; he needed more time to ponder a question of\nmedical treatment, and he would often spend long hours poring over the\ndata tapes before deciding what to do in a given case--but he always\nseemed to come up with an answer, and his answers usually worked. Above\nall, Tiger's relations with the odd life-forms they encountered were\ninvariably good; the creatures seemed to like him, and would follow his\ninstructions faithfully.\n\nDal, too, had opportunities to demonstrate that his surgical skill and\njudgment was not universally faulty in spite of the trouble on Morua\nVIII. More than once he succeeded in almost impossible surgical cases\nwhere there was no time to call for help, and little by little he could\nsense Jack's growing confidence in his abilities, grudging though it\nmight be.\n\nDal had ample time to mull over the thing that had happened on Morua\nVIII and to think about the interview with Black Doctor Tanner\nafterward. He knew he was glad that Tiger had intervened even on the\nbasis of a falsehood; until Tiger had spoken up Dal had been certain\nthat the Black Doctor fully intended to use the incident as an excuse to\ndischarge him from the General Practice Patrol. There was no question in\nhis mind that the Black Doctor's charges had been exaggerated into a\ntrumped-up case against him, and there was no question that Tiger's\ninsistence on taking the blame had saved him; he could not help being\nthankful.\n\nYet there was something about it that disturbed Dal, nibbling away\npersistently at his mind. He couldn't throw off the feeling that his own\nacceptance of Tiger's help had been wrong.\n\nPart of it, he knew, was his native, inbred loathing for falsehood. Fair\nor unfair, Dal had always disliked lying. Among his people, the truth\nmight be bent occasionally, but frank lying was considered a deep\ndisgrace, and there was a Garvian saying that \"a false tongue wins no\ntrue friends.\" Garvian traders were known throughout the Galaxy as much\nfor their rigid adherence to their word as they were for the hard\nbargains they could drive; Dal had been enormously confused during his\nfirst months on Hospital Earth by the way Earthmen seemed to accept\nlying as part of their daily life, unconcerned about it as long as the\nfalsehood could not be proven.\n\nBut something else about Tiger's defense of him bothered Dal far more\nthan the falsehood--something that had vaguely disturbed him ever since\nhe had known the big Earthman, and that now seemed to elude him every\ntime he tried to pinpoint it. Lying in his bunk during a sleep period,\nDal remembered vividly the first time he had met Tiger, early in the\nsecond year of medical school. Dal had almost despaired by then of\nmaking friends with his hostile and resentful classmates and had begun\nmore and more to avoid contact with them, building up a protective shell\nand relying on Fuzzy for company or comfort. Then Tiger had found him\neating lunch by himself in the medical school lounge one day and flopped\ndown in the seat beside him and began talking as if Dal were just\nanother classmate. Tiger's open friendliness had been like a spring\nbreeze to Dal who was desperately lonely in this world of strangers;\ntheir friendship had grown rapidly, and gradually others in the class\nhad begun to thaw enough at least to be civil when Dal was around. Dal\nhad sensed that this change of heart was largely because of Tiger and\nnot because of him, yet he had welcomed it as a change from the previous\nintolerable coldness even though it left him feeling vaguely uneasy.\nTiger was well liked by the others in the class; Dal had been grateful\nmore than once when Tiger had risen in hot defense of the Garvian's\nright to be studying medicine among Earthmen in the school on Hospital\nEarth.\n\nBut that had been in medical school, among classmates. Somehow that had\nbeen different from the incident that occurred on Morua VIII, and Dal's\nuneasiness grew stronger than ever the more he thought of it. Talking to\nTiger about it was no help; Tiger just grinned and told him to forget\nit, but even in the rush of shipboard activity it stubbornly refused to\nbe forgotten.\n\nOne minor matter also helped to ease the tension between the doctors as\nthey made their daily rounds. Tiger brought a pink dispatch sheet in to\nDal one day, grinning happily. \"This is from the weekly news capsule,\"\nhe said. \"It ought to cheer you up.\"\n\nIt was a brief news note, listed under \"incidental items.\" \"The Black\nService of Pathology,\" it said, \"has announced that Black Doctor Hugo\nTanner will enter Hospital Philadelphia within the next week for\nprophylactic heart surgery. In keeping with usual Hospital Earth\nadministrative policy, the Four-star Black Doctor will undergo a total\ncardiac transplant to halt the Medical education administrator's\nprogressively disabling heart disease.\" The note went on to name the\nsurgeons who would officiate at the procedure.\n\nDal smiled and handed back the dispatch. \"Maybe it will improve his\ntemper,\" he said, \"even if it does give him another fifty years of\nactive life.\"\n\n\"Well, at least it will take him out of _our_ hair for a while,\" Tiger\nsaid. \"He won't have time to keep us under too close scrutiny.\"\n\nWhich, Dal was forced to admit, did not make him too unhappy.\n\nShipboard rounds kept all three doctors busy. Often, with contact\nlandings, calls, and studying, it seemed only a brief time from sleep\nperiod to sleep period, but still they had some time for minor luxuries.\nDal was almost continuously shivering, with the ship kept at a\ntemperature that was comfortable for Tiger and Jack; he missed the\ntropical heat of his home planet, and sometimes it seemed that he was\nchilled down to the marrow of his bones in spite of his coat of gray\nfur. With a little home-made plumbing and ingenuity, he finally managed\nto convert one of the ship's shower units into a steam bath. Once or\ntwice each day he would retire for a blissful half hour warming himself\nup to Garv II normal temperatures.\n\nFuzzy also became a part of shipboard routine. Once he grew accustomed\nto Tiger and Jack and the surroundings aboard the ship, the little\ncreature grew bored sitting on Dal's shoulder and wanted to be in the\nmiddle of things. Since the early tension had eased, he was willing to\nbe apart from his master from time to time, so Dal and Tiger built him a\nplatform that hung from the ceiling of the control room. There Fuzzy\nwould sit and swing by the hour, blinking happily at the activity going\non all around him.\n\nBut for all the appearance of peace and agreement, there was still an\nundercurrent of tension on board the _Lancet_ which flared up from time\nto time when it was least expected, between Dal and Jack. It was on one\nsuch occasion that a major crisis almost developed, and once again Fuzzy\nwas the center of the contention.\n\nDal Timgar knew that disaster had struck at the very moment it happened,\nbut he could not tell exactly what was wrong. All he knew was that\nsomething fearful had happened to Fuzzy.\n\nThere was a small sound-proof cubicle in the computer room, with a\nchair, desk and a tape-reader for the doctors when they had odd moments\nto spend reading up on recent medical bulletins or reviewing their\ntextbooks. Dal spent more time here than the other two; the temperature\nof the room could be turned up, and he had developed a certain fondness\nfor the place with its warm gray walls and its soft relaxing light. Here\non the tapes were things that he could grapple with, things that he\ncould understand. If a problem here eluded him, he could study it out\nuntil he had mastered it. The hours he spent here were a welcome retreat\nfrom the confusing complexities of getting along with Jack and Tiger.\n\nThese long study periods were boring for Fuzzy who wasn't much\ninterested in the oxygen-exchange mechanism of the intelligent beetles\nof Aldebaran VI. Frequently Dal would leave him to swing on his platform\nor explore about the control cabin while he spent an hour or two at\nthe tape-reader. Today Dal had been working for over an hour,\ndeeply immersed in a review of the intermediary metabolism of\nchlorine-breathing mammals, when something abruptly wrenched his\nattention from the tape.\n\nIt was as though a light had snapped off in his mind, or a door slammed\nshut. There was no sound, no warning; yet, suddenly, he felt dreadfully,\nfrighteningly alone, as if in a split second something inside him had\nbeen torn away. He sat bolt upright, staring, and he felt his skin crawl\nand his fingers tremble as he listened, trying to spot the source of the\ntrouble.\n\nAnd then, almost instinctively, he knew what was wrong. He leaped to\nhis feet, tore open the door to the cubicle and dashed down the hallway\ntoward the control room. \"Fuzzy!\" he shouted. \"Fuzzy, _where are you?_\"\n\nTiger and Jack were both at the control panel dictating records for\nfiling. They looked up in surprise as the Red Doctor burst into the\nroom. Fuzzy's platform was hanging empty, gently swaying back and forth.\nDal peered frantically around the room. There was no sign of the small\npink creature.\n\n\"Where is he?\" he demanded. \"What's happened to Fuzzy?\"\n\nJack shrugged in disgust. \"He's up on his perch. Where else?\"\n\n\"He's not either! Where is he?\"\n\nJack blinked at the empty perch. \"He was there just a minute ago. I saw\nhim.\"\n\n\"Well, he's not there now, and something's wrong!\" In a panic, Dal began\nsearching the room, knocking over stools, scattering piles of paper,\npeering in every corner where Fuzzy might be concealed.\n\nFor a moment the others sat frozen, watching him. Then Tiger jumped to\nhis feet. \"Hold it, hold it! He probably just wandered off for a minute.\nHe does that all the time.\"\n\n\"No, it's something worse than that.\" Dal was almost choking on the\nwords. \"Something terrible has happened. I know it.\"\n\nJack Alvarez tossed the recorder down in disgust. \"You and your\nmiserable pet!\" he said. \"I knew we shouldn't have kept him on board.\"\n\nDal stared at Jack. Suddenly all the anger and bitterness of the past\nfew weeks could no longer be held in. Without warning he hurled himself\nat the Blue Doctor's throat. \"Where is he?\" he cried. \"What have you\ndone with him? What have you done to Fuzzy? You've done something to\nhim! You've hated him every minute just like you hate me, only he's\neasier to pick on. Now where is he? What have you done to him?\"\n\nJack staggered back, trying to push the furious little Garvian away.\n\"Wait a minute! Get away from me! I didn't do anything!\"\n\n\"You did too! Where is he?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\" Jack struggled to break free, but there was powerful\nstrength in Dal's fingers for all his slight body build. \"I tell you, he\nwas here just a minute ago.\"\n\nDal felt a hand grip his collar then, and Tiger was dragging them apart\nlike two dogs in a fight. \"Now stop this!\" he roared, holding them both\nat arm's length. \"I said _stop it_! Jack didn't do anything to Fuzzy,\nhe's been sitting here with me ever since you went back to the cubicle.\nHe hasn't even budged.\"\n\n\"But he's _gone_,\" Dal panted. \"Something's happened to him. I _know_\nit.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"I--I just know. I can feel it.\"\n\n\"All right, then let's find him,\" Tiger said. \"He's got to be somewhere\non the ship. If he's in trouble, we're wasting time fighting.\"\n\nTiger let go, and Jack brushed off his shirt, his face very white. \"I\nsaw him just a little while ago,\" he said. \"He was sitting up on that\nsilly perch watching us, and then swinging back and forth and swinging\nover to that cabinet and back.\"\n\n\"Well, let's get started looking,\" Tiger said.\n\nThey fanned out, with Jack still muttering to himself, and searched the\ncontrol room inch by inch. There was no sign of Fuzzy. Dal had control\nof himself now, but he searched with a frantic intensity. \"He's not in\nhere,\" he said at last, \"he must have gone out somewhere.\"\n\n\"There was only one door open,\" Tiger said. \"The one you just came\nthrough, from the rear corridor. Dal, you search the computer room.\nJack, check the lab and I'll go back to the reactors.\"\n\nThey started searching the compartments off the rear corridor. For ten\nminutes there was no sound in the ship but the occasional slamming of a\nhatch, the grate of a desk drawer, the bang of a cabinet door. Dal\nworked through the maze of cubby-holes in the computer room with growing\nhopelessness. The frightening sense of loneliness and loss in his mind\nwas overwhelming; he was almost physically ill. The warm, comfortable\nfeeling of _contact_ that he had always had before with Fuzzy was gone.\nAs the minutes passed, hopelessness gave way to despair.\n\nThen Jack gave a hoarse cry from the lab. Dal tripped and stumbled in\nhis haste to get down the corridor, and almost collided with Tiger at\nthe lab door.\n\n\"I think we're too late,\" Jack said. \"He's gotten into the formalin.\"\n\nHe lifted one of the glass beakers down from the shelf to the work\nbench. It was obvious what had happened. Fuzzy had gone exploring and\nhad found the laboratory a fascinating place. Several of the reagents\nbottles had been knocked over as if he had been sampling them. The glass\nlid to the beaker of formalin which was kept for tissue specimens had\nbeen pushed aside just enough to admit the little creature's two-inch\ngirth. Now Fuzzy lay in the bottom of the beaker, immersed in formalin,\na formless, shapeless blob of sickly gray jelly.\n\n\"Are you sure it's formalin?\" Dal asked.\n\nJack poured off the fluid, and the acrid smell of formaldehyde that\nfilled the room answered the question. \"It's no good, Dal,\" he said,\nalmost gently. \"The stuff destroys protein, and that's about all he was.\nI'm sorry--I was beginning to like the little punk, even if he did get\non my nerves. But he picked the one thing to fall into that could kill\nhim. Unless he had some way to set up a protective barrier....\"\n\nDal took the beaker. \"Get me some saline,\" he said tightly. \"And some\nnutrient broth.\"\n\nJack pulled out two jugs and poured their contents into an empty beaker.\nDal popped the tiny limp form into the beaker and began massaging it.\nLayers of damaged tissue peeled off in his hand, but he continued\nmassaging and changing the solutions, first saline, then nutrient broth.\n\"Get me some sponges and a blade.\"\n\nTiger brought them in. Carefully Dal began debriding the damaged outer\nlayers. Jack and Tiger watched; then Jack said, \"Look, there's a tinge\nof pink in the middle.\"\n\nSlowly the faint pink in the center grew more ruddy. Dal changed\nsolutions again, and sank down on a stool. \"I think he'll make it,\" he\nsaid. \"He has enormous regenerative powers as long as any fragment of\nhim is left.\" He looked up at Jack who was still watching the creature\nin the beaker almost solicitously. \"I guess I made a fool of myself back\nthere when I jumped you.\"\n\nJack's face hardened, as though he had been caught off guard. \"I guess\nyou did, all right.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm sorry. I just couldn't think straight. It was the first time\nI'd ever been--apart from him.\"\n\n\"I still say he doesn't belong aboard,\" Jack said. \"This is a medical\nship, not a menagerie. And if you ever lay your hands on me again,\nyou'll wish you hadn't.\"\n\n\"I said I was sorry,\" Dal said.\n\n\"I heard you,\" Jack said. \"I just don't believe you, that's all.\"\n\nHe gave Fuzzy a final glance, and then headed back to the control room.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFuzzy recovered, a much abashed and subdued Fuzzy, clinging timorously\nto Dal's shoulder and refusing to budge for three days, but apparently\nbasically unharmed by his inadvertent swim in the deadly formalin bath.\nPresently he seemed to forget the experience altogether, and once again\ntook his perch on the platform in the control room.\n\nBut Dal did not forget. He said little to Tiger and Jack, but the\nincident had shaken him severely. For as long as he could remember, he\nhad always had Fuzzy close at hand. He had never before in his life\nexperienced the dreadful feeling of emptiness and desertion, the almost\nparalyzing fear and helplessness that he had felt when Fuzzy had lost\ncontact with him. It had seemed as though a vital part of him had\nsuddenly been torn away, and the memory of the panic that followed sent\nchills down his back and woke him up trembling from his sleep. He was\nashamed of his unwarranted attack on Jack, yet even this seemed\ninsignificant in comparison to the powerful fear that had been driving\nhim.\n\nHappily, the Blue Doctor chose to let the matter rest where it was, and\nif anything, seemed more willing than before to be friendly. For the\nfirst time he seemed to take an active interest in Fuzzy, \"chatting\"\nwith him when he thought no one was around, and bringing him occasional\ntid-bits of food after meals were over.\n\nOnce more life on the _Lancet_ settled back to routine, only to have it\nshattered by an incident of quite a different nature. It was just after\nthey had left a small planet in the Procyon system, one of the routine\ncheck-in points, that they made contact with the Garvian trading ship.\n\nDal recognized the ship's design and insignia even before the signals\ncame in, and could hardly contain his excitement. He had not seen a\nfellow countryman for years except for an occasional dull luncheon with\nthe Garvian ambassador to Hospital Earth during medical school days. The\nthought of walking the corridors of a Garvian trading ship again brought\nan overwhelming wave of homesickness. He was so excited he could hardly\nwait for Jack to complete the radio-sighting formalities. \"What ship is\nshe?\" he wanted to know. \"What house?\"\n\nJack handed him the message transcript. \"The ship is the _Teegar_,\" he\nsaid. \"Flagship of the SinSin trading fleet. They want permission to\napproach us.\"\n\nDal let out a whoop. \"Then it's a space trader, and a big one. You've\nnever seen ships like these before.\"\n\nTiger joined them, staring at the message transcript. \"A SinSin ship!\nSend them the word, Jack, and be quick, before they get disgusted and\nmove on.\"\n\nJack sent out the approach authorization, and they watched with growing\nexcitement as the great trading vessel began its close-approach\nmaneuvers.\n\nThe name of the house of SinSin was famous throughout the galaxy. It was\none of the oldest and largest of the great trading firms that had built\nGarv II into its position of leadership in the Confederation, and the\nSinSin ships had penetrated to every corner of the galaxy, to every\nknown planet harboring an intelligent life-form.\n\nTiger and Jack had seen the multitudes of exotic products in the\nHospital Earth stores that came from the great Garvian ships on their\nfrequent visits. But this was more than a planetary trader loaded with a\nfew items for a single planet. The space traders roamed from star system\nto star system, their holds filled with treasures beyond number. Such\nships as these might be out from Garv II for decades at a time,\ntempting any ship they met with the magnificent variety of wares they\ncarried.\n\nSlowly the trader approached, and Dal took the speaker, addressing the\ncommander of the _Teegar_ in Garvian. \"This is the General Practice\nPatrol Ship _Lancet_,\" he said, \"out from Hospital Earth with three\nphysicians aboard, including a countryman of yours.\"\n\n\"Is that Dal Timgar?\" the reply came back. \"By the Seven Moons! We'd\nheard that there was now a Garvian physician, and couldn't believe our\nears. Come aboard, all of you, you'll be welcome. We'll send over a\nlifeboat!\"\n\nThe _Teegar_ was near now, a great gleaming ship with the sign of the\nhouse of SinSin on her hull. A lifeboat sprang from a launching rack and\nspeared across to the _Lancet_. Moments later the three doctors were\nclimbing into the sleek little vessel and moving across the void of\nspace to the huge Garvian ship.\n\nIt was like stepping from a jungle outpost village into a magnificent,\nglittering city. The Garvian ship was enormous; she carried a crew of\nseveral hundred, and the wealth and luxury of the ship took the\nEarthmen's breath away. The cabins and lounges were paneled with\nexpensive fabrics and rare woods, the furniture inlaid with precious\nmetals. Down the long corridors goods of the traders were laid out in\nresplendent display, surpassing the richest show cases in the shops on\nHospital Earth.\n\nThey received a royal welcome from the commander of the _Teegar_, an\naged, smiling little Garvian with a pink fuzz-ball on his shoulder that\ncould have been Fuzzy's twin. He bowed low to Tiger and Jack, leading\nthem into the reception lounge where a great table was spread with foods\nand pastries of all varieties. Then he turned to Dal and embraced him\nlike a long-lost brother. \"Your father Jai Timgar has long been an\nhonored friend of the house of SinSin, and anyone of the house of Timgar\nis the same as my own son and my son's son! But this collar! This cuff!\nIs it really possible that a man of Garv has become a physician of\nHospital Earth?\"\n\nDal touched Fuzzy to the commander's fuzz-ball in the ancient Garvian\ngreeting. \"It's possible, and true,\" he said. \"I studied there. I am the\nRed Doctor on this patrol ship.\"\n\n\"Ah, but this is good,\" the commander said. \"What better way to draw our\nworlds together, eh? But come, you must look and see what we have in our\nstorerooms, feast your eyes on the splendors we carry. For all of you, a\nthousand wonders are to be found here.\"\n\nJack hesitated as the commander led them back toward the display\ncorridors. \"We'd be glad to see the ship, but you should know that\npatrol ship physicians have little money to spend.\"\n\n\"Who speaks of money?\" the commander cried. \"Did I speak of it? Come and\nlook! Money is nothing. The Garvian traders are not mere money-changers.\nLook and enjoy; if there is something that strikes your eye, something\nthat would fulfill the desires of your heart, it will be yours.\" He gave\nDal a smile and a sly wink. \"Surely our brother here has told you many\ntimes of the wonders to be seen in a space trader, and terms can be\narranged that will make any small purchase a painless pleasure.\"\n\nHe led them off, like a head of state conducting visiting dignitaries on\na tour, with a retinue of Garvian underlings trailing behind them. For\ntwo delirious hours they wandered the corridors of the great ship,\nstaring hungrily at the dazzling displays. They had been away from\nHospital Earth and its shops and stores for months; now it seemed they\nwere walking through an incredible treasure-trove stocked with\neverything that they could possibly have wanted.\n\nFor Jack there was a dress uniform, specially tailored for a physician\nin the Blue Service of Diagnosis, the insignia woven into the cloth with\ngold and platinum thread. Reluctantly he turned away from it, a luxury\nhe could never dream of affording. For Tiger, who had been muttering for\nweeks about getting out of condition in the sedentary life of the ship,\nthere was a set of bar bells and gymnasium equipment ingeniously\ndesigned to collapse into a unit no larger than one foot square, yet\nopening out into a completely equipped gym. Dal's eyes glittered at the\nnew sets of surgical instruments, designed to the most rigid Hospital\nEarth specifications, which appeared almost without his asking to see\nthem. There were clothes and games, precious stones and exotic rings,\nwatches set with Arcturian dream-stones, and boots inlaid with silver.\n\nThey made their way through the corridors, reluctant to leave one\ndisplay for the next. Whenever something caught their eyes, the\ncommander snapped his fingers excitedly, and the item was unobtrusively\nnoted down by one of the underlings. Finally, exhausted and glutted just\nfrom looking, they turned back toward the reception room.\n\n\"The things are beautiful,\" Tiger said wistfully, \"but impossible.\nStill, you were very kind to take your time--\"\n\n\"Time? I have nothing but time.\" The commander smiled again at Dal. \"And\nthere is an old Garvian proverb that to the wise man 'impossible' has no\nmeaning. Wait, you will see!\"\n\nThey came out into the lounge, and the doctors stopped short in\namazement. Spread out before them were all of the items that had\ncaptured their interest earlier.\n\n\"But this is ridiculous,\" Jack said staring at the dress uniform. \"We\ncouldn't possibly buy these things, it would take our salaries for\ntwenty years to pay for them.\"\n\n\"Have we mentioned price even once?\" the commander protested. \"You are\nthe crewmates of one of our own people! We would not dream of setting\nprices that we would normally set for such trifles as these. And as for\nterms, you have no worry. Take the goods aboard your ship, they are\nalready yours. We have drawn up contracts for you which require no\npayment whatever for five years, and then payments of only a fiftieth of\nthe value for each successive year. And for each of you, with the\ncompliments of the house of SinSin, a special gift at no charge\nwhatever.\"\n\nHe placed in Jack's hands a small box with the lid tipped back. Against\na black velvet lining lay a silver star, and the official insignia of a\nStar Physician in the Blue Service. \"You cannot wear it yet, of course,\"\nthe commander said. \"But one day you will need it.\"\n\nJack blinked at the jewel-like star. \"You are very kind,\" he said. \"I--I\nmean perhaps--\" He looked at Tiger, and then at the display of goods on\nthe table. \"Perhaps there are _some_ things--\"\n\nAlready two of the Garvian crewmen were opening the lock to the\nlifeboat, preparing to move the goods aboard. Then Dal Timgar spoke up\nsharply. \"I think you'd better wait a moment,\" he said.\n\n\"And for you,\" the commander continued, turning to Dal so smoothly that\nthere seemed no break in his voice at all, \"as one of our own people,\nand an honored son of Jai Timgar, who has been kind to the house of\nSinSin for many years, I have something out of the ordinary. I'm sure\nyour crewmates would not object to a special gift at my personal\nexpense.\"\n\nThe commander lifted a scarf from the table and revealed the glittering\nset of surgical instruments, neatly displayed in a velvet-lined carrying\ncase. The commander took it up from the table and thrust it into Dal's\nhands. \"It is yours, my friend. And for this, there will be no contract\nwhatever.\"\n\nDal stared down at the instruments. They were beautiful. He longed just\nto touch them, to hold them in his hands, but he shook his head and set\nthe case back on the table. He looked up at Tiger and Jack. \"You should\nbe warned that the prices on these goods are four times what they ought\nto be, and the deferred-payment contracts he wants you to sign will\npermit as much as 24 per cent interest on the unpaid balance, with no\nclosing-out clause. That means you would be paying many times the stated\nprice for the goods before the contract is closed. You can go ahead and\nsign if you want but understand what you're signing.\"\n\nThe Garvian commander stared at him, and then shook his head, laughing.\n\"Of course your friend is not serious,\" he said. \"These prices can be\ncompared on any planet and you will see their fairness. Here, read the\ncontracts, see what they say and decide for yourselves.\" He held out a\nsheaf of papers.\n\n\"The contracts may sound well enough,\" Dal said, \"but I'm telling you\nwhat they actually say.\"\n\nJack looked stricken. \"But surely just one or two things--\"\n\nTiger shook his head. \"Dal knows what he's talking about. I don't think\nwe'd better buy anything at all.\"\n\nThe Garvian commander turned to Dal angrily. \"What are you telling them?\nThere is nothing false in these contracts!\"\n\n\"I didn't say there was. I just can't see them taking a beating with\ntheir eyes shut, that's all. Your contracts are legal enough, but the\nprices and terms are piracy, and you know it.\"\n\nThe commander glared at him for a moment. Then he turned away\nscornfully. \"So what I have heard is true, after all,\" he said. \"You\nreally have thrown in your lot with these pill-peddlers, these idiots\nfrom Earth who can't even wipe their noses without losing in a trade.\"\nHe signaled the lifeboat pilot. \"Take them back to their ship, we're\nwasting our time. There are better things to do than to deal with\ntraitors.\"\n\nThe trip back to the _Lancet_ was made in silence. Dal could sense the\npilot's scorn as he dumped them off in their entrance lock, and dashed\nback to the _Teegar_ with the lifeboat. Gloomily Jack and Tiger followed\nDal into the control room, a drab little cubby-hole compared to the\n_Teegar_'s lounge.\n\n\"Well, it was fun while it lasted,\" Jack said finally, looking up at\nDal. \"But the way that guy slammed you, I wish we'd never gone.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Dal said. \"The commander just thought he saw a perfect setup.\nHe figured you'd never question the contracts if I backed him up.\"\n\n\"It would have been easy enough. Why didn't you?\"\n\nDal looked at the Blue Doctor. \"Maybe I just don't like people who give\naway surgical sets,\" he said. \"Remember, I'm not a Garvian trader any\nmore. I'm a doctor from Hospital Earth.\"\n\nMoments later, the great Garvian ship was gone, and the red light was\nblinking on the call board. Tiger started tracking down the call while\nJack went back to work on the daily log book and Dal set up food for\ndinner. The pleasant dreams were over; they were back in the harness of\npatrol ship doctors once again.\n\nJack and Dal were finishing dinner when Tiger came back with a puzzled\nfrown on his face. \"Finally traced that call. At least I think I did.\nAnybody ever hear of a star called 31 Brucker?\"\n\n\"Brucker?\" Jack said. \"It isn't on the list of contracts. What's the\ntrouble?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure,\" Tiger said. \"I'm not even certain if it's a call or not.\nCome on up front and see what you think.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\nPLAGUE!\n\n\nIn the control room the interstellar radio and teletype-translator were\nsilent. The red light on the call board was still blinking; Tiger turned\nit off with a snap. \"Here's the message that just came in, as near as I\ncan make out,\" he said, \"and if you can make sense of it, you're way\nahead of me.\"\n\nThe message was a single word, teletyped in the center of a blue\ndispatch sheet:\n\n      GREETINGS\n\n\"This is all?\" Jack said.\n\n\"That's every bit of it. They repeated it half a dozen times, just like\nthat.\"\n\n\"_Who_ repeated it?\" Dal asked. \"Where are the identification symbols?\"\n\n\"There weren't any,\" said Tiger. \"Our own computer designated 31 Brucker\nfrom the direction and intensity of the signal. The question is, what do\nwe do?\"\n\nThe message stared up at them cryptically. Dal shook his head. \"Doesn't\ngive us much to go on, that's certain. Even the location could be wrong\nif the signal came in on an odd frequency or from a long distance. Let's\nbeam back at the same direction and intensity and see what happens.\"\n\nTiger took the earphones and speaker, and turned the signal beam to\ncoincide with the direction of the incoming message.\n\n\"We have your contact. Can you hear me? Who are you and what do you\nwant?\"\n\nThere was a long delay and they thought the contact was lost. Then a\nvoice came whispering through the static. \"Where is your ship now? Are\nyou near to us?\"\n\n\"We need your co-ordinates in order to tell,\" Tiger said. \"Who are you?\"\n\nAgain a long pause and a howl of static. Then: \"If you are far away it\nwill be too late. We have no time left, we are dying....\"\n\nAbruptly the voice message broke off and co-ordinates began coming\nthrough between bursts of static. Tiger scribbled them down, piecing\nthem together through several repetitions. \"Check these out fast,\" he\ntold Jack. \"This sounds like real trouble.\" He tossed Dal another pair\nof earphones and turned back to the speaker. \"Are you a contract\nplanet?\" he signaled. \"Do we have a survey on you?\"\n\nThere was a much longer pause. Then the voice came back, \"No, we have no\ncontract. We are all dying, but if you must have a contract to come....\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" Tiger sent back. \"We're coming. Keep your frequency open.\nWe will contact again when we are closer.\"\n\nHe tossed down the earphones and looked excitedly at Dal. \"Did you hear\nthat? A planet calling for help, with no Hospital Earth contract!\"\n\n\"They sound desperate,\" Dal said. \"We'd better go there, contract or no\ncontract.\"\n\n\"Of course we'll go there, you idiot. See if Jack has those co-ordinates\ncharted, and start digging up information on them, everything you can\nfind. We need all of the dope we can get and we need it fast. This is\nour golden chance to seal a contract with a new planet.\"\n\nAll three of the doctors fell to work trying to identify the mysterious\ncaller. Dal began searching the information file for data on 31 Brucker,\npunching all the reference tags he could think of, as well as the\ngalactic co-ordinates of the planet. He could hardly control his fingers\nas the tapes with possible references began plopping down into the\nslots. Tiger was right; this was almost too good to be true. When a\nplanet without a medical service contract called a GPP Ship for help,\nthere was always hope that a brand new contract might be signed if the\ncall was successful. And no greater honor could come to a patrol craft\ncrew than to be the originators of a new contract for Hospital Earth.\n\nBut there were problems in dealing with uncontacted planets. Many star\nsystems had never been explored by ships of the Confederation. Many\nraces, like Earthmen at the time their star-drive was discovered, had no\ninkling of the existence of a Galactic Confederation of worlds. There\nmight be no information whatever about the special anatomical and\nphysiological characteristics of the inhabitants of an uncontacted\nplanet, and often a patrol crew faced insurmountable difficulties,\ncoming in blind to solve a medical problem.\n\nDal had his information gathered first--a disappointingly small amount\nindeed. Among the billions of notes on file in the _Lancet_'s data bank,\nthere were only two scraps of data available on the 31 Brucker system.\n\n\"Is this all you could find?\" Tiger said, staring at the information\nslips.\n\n\"There's just nothing else there,\" Dal said. \"This one is a description\nand classification of the star, and it doesn't sound like the one who\nwrote it had even been near it.\"\n\n\"He hadn't,\" Tiger said. \"This is a routine radio-telescopic survey\nreport. The star is a red giant. Big and cold, with three--possibly\nfour--planets inside the outer envelope of the star itself, and only one\noutside it. Nothing about satellites. None of the planets thought to be\nhabitable by man. What's the other item?\"\n\n\"An exploratory report on the outer planet, done eight hundred years\nago. Says it's an Earth-type planet, and not much else. Gives reference\nto the full report in the Confederation files. Not a word about an\nintelligent race living there.\"\n\n\"Well, maybe Jack's got a bit more for us,\" Tiger said. \"If the place\nhas been explored, there must be _some_ information about the\ninhabitants.\"\n\nBut Jack also came up with a blank. Central Records on Hospital Earth\nsent back a physical description of a tiny outer planet of the star,\nwith a thin oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere, very little water, and enough\nmethane mixed in to make the atmosphere deadly to Earthmen.\n\n\"Then there's never been a medical service contract?\" Tiger asked.\n\n\"Contract!\" Jack said. \"It doesn't even say there are any people there.\nNot a word about any kind of life form.\"\n\n\"Well, that's ridiculous,\" Dal said. \"If we're getting messages from\nthere, somebody must be sending them. But if a Confederation ship\nexplored there, there's a way to find out. How soon can we convert to\nstar-drive?\"\n\n\"As soon as we can get strapped down,\" Tiger said.\n\n\"Then send our reconversion co-ordinates to the Confederation\nheadquarters on Garv II and request the Confederation records on the\nplace.\"\n\nJack stared at him. \"You mean just ask to see Confederation records? We\ncan't do that, they'd skin us alive. Those records are closed to\neveryone except full members of the Confederation.\"\n\n\"Tell them it's an emergency,\" Dal said. \"If they want to be legal about\nit, give them my Confederation serial number. Garv II is a member of the\nConfederation, and I'm a native-born citizen.\"\n\nTiger got the request off while Jack and Dal strapped down for the\nconversion to Koenig drive. Five minutes later Tiger joined them,\ngrinning from ear to ear. \"Didn't even have to pull rank,\" he said.\n\"When they started to argue, I just told them it was an emergency, and\nif they didn't let us see any records they had, we would file their\nrefusal against claims that might come up later. They quit arguing.\nWe'll have the records as soon as we reconvert.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe star that they were seeking was a long distance from the current\nlocation of the _Lancet_. The ship was in Koenig drive for hours before\nit reconverted, and even Dal was beginning to feel the first pangs of\ndrive-sickness before they felt the customary jolting vibration of the\nchange to normal space, and saw bright stars again in the viewscreen.\n\nThe star called 31 Brucker was close then. It was indeed a red giant;\nlong tenuous plumes of gas spread out for hundreds of millions of miles\non all sides of its glowing red core. This mammoth star did not look so\ncold now, as they stared at it in the viewscreen, yet among the family\nof stars it was a cold, dying giant with only a few moments of life left\non the astronomical time scale. From the _Lancet_'s position, no\nplanets at all were visible to the naked eye, but with the telescope\nJack soon found two inside the star's envelope of gas and one tiny one\noutside. They would have to be searched for, and the one that they were\nhoping to reach located before centering and landing maneuvers could be\nbegun.\n\nAlready the radio was chattering with two powerful signals coming in.\nOne came from the Galactic Confederation headquarters on Garv II; the\nother was a good clear signal from very close range, unquestionably\nbeamed to them from the planet in distress.\n\nThey watched as the Confederation report came clacking off the teletype,\nand they stared at it unbelieving.\n\n\"It just doesn't make sense,\" Jack said. \"There _must_ be intelligent\ncreatures down there. They're sending radio signals.\"\n\n\"Then why a report like this?\" Tiger said. \"This was filed by a routine\nexploratory ship that came here eight hundred years ago. You can't tell\nme that any intelligent race could develop from scratch in less than\neight centuries' time.\"\n\nDal picked up the report and read it again. \"This red giant star,\" he\nread, \"was studied in the usual fashion. It was found to have seven\nplanets, all but one lying within the tenuous outer gas envelope of the\nstar itself. The seventh planet has an atmosphere of its own, and\ntravels an orbit well outside the star surface. This planet was selected\nfor landing and exploration.\"\n\nFollowing this was a long, detailed and exceedingly dull description of\nthe step-by-step procedure followed by a Confederation exploratory ship\nmaking a first landing on a barren planet. There was a description of\nthe atmosphere, the soil surface, the land masses and major water\nbodies. Physically, the planet was a desert, hot and dry, and barren of\nvegetation excepting in two or three areas of jungle along the equator.\n\"The planet is inhabited by numerous small unintelligent animal species\nwhich seem well-adapted to the semi-arid conditions. Of higher animals\nand mammals only two species were discovered, and of these the most\nhighly developed was an erect biped with an integrated central nervous\nsystem and the intelligence level of a Garvian _drachma_.\"\n\n\"How small is that?\" Jack said.\n\n\"Idiot-level,\" Dal said glumly. \"I.Q. of about 20 on the human scale. I\nguess the explorers weren't much impressed; they didn't even put the\nplanet down for a routine colonization survey.\"\n\n\"Well, _something_ has happened down there since then. Idiots can't\nbuild interstellar radios.\" Jack turned to Tiger. \"Are you getting\nthem?\"\n\nTiger nodded. A voice was coming over the speaker, hesitant and\napologetic, using the common tongue of the Galactic Confederation. \"How\nsoon can you come?\" the voice was asking clearly, still with the sound\nof great reticence. \"There is not much time.\"\n\n\"But who are you?\" Tiger asked. \"What's wrong down there?\"\n\n\"We are sick, dying, thousands of us. But if you have other work that is\nmore pressing, we would not want to delay you--\"\n\nJack shook his head, frowning. \"I don't get this,\" he said. \"What are\nthey afraid of?\"\n\nTiger spoke into the microphone again. \"We will be glad to help, but we\nneed information about you. You have our position--can you send up a\nspokesman to tell us your problem?\"\n\nA long pause, and then the voice came back wearily. \"It will be done.\nStand by to receive him.\"\n\nTiger snapped off the radio receiver and looked up triumphantly at the\nothers. \"Now we're getting somewhere. If the people down there can send\na ship out with a spokesman to tell us about their troubles, we've got a\nchance to sew up a contract, and that could mean a Star for every one of\nus.\"\n\n\"Yes, but who are they?\" Dal said. \"And where were they when the\nConfederation ship was here?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Jack said, \"but I'll bet you both that we have quite a\ntime finding out.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Tiger said. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean we'd better be very careful here,\" Jack said darkly. \"I don't\nknow about you, but I think this whole business has a very strange\nsmell.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was nothing strange about the Bruckian ship when it finally came\ninto view. It was a standard design, surface-launching interplanetary\ncraft, with separated segments on either side suggesting atomic engines.\nThey saw the side jets flare as the ship maneuvered to come in alongside\nthe _Lancet_.\n\nGrapplers were thrown out to bind the emissary ship to the _Lancet_'s\nhull, and Jack threw the switches to open the entrance lock and\ndecontamination chambers. They had taken pains to describe the interior\natmosphere of the patrol ship and warn the spokesman to keep himself in\na sealed pressure suit. On the intercom viewscreens they saw the small\nsuited figure cross from his ship into the _Lancet_'s lock, and watched\nas the sprays of formalin washed down the outside of the suit.\n\nMoments later the creature stepped out of the decontamination chamber.\nHe was small and humanoid, with tiny fragile bones and pale, hairless\nskin. He stood no more than four feet high. More than anything else, he\nlooked like a very intelligent monkey with a diminutive space suit\nfitting his fragile body. When he spoke the words came through the\ntranslator in English; but Dal recognized the flowing syllables of the\nuniversal language of the Galactic Confederation.\n\n\"How do you know the common tongue?\" he said. \"There is no record of\nyour people in our Confederation, yet you use our own universal\nlanguage.\"\n\nThe Bruckian nodded. \"We know the language well. My people dread outside\ncontact--it is a racial characteristic--but we hear the Confederation\nbroadcasts and have learned to understand the common tongue.\" The\nspace-suited stranger looked at the doctors one by one. \"We also know of\nthe good works of the ships from Hospital Earth, and now we appeal to\nyou.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Jack said. \"You gave us no information, nothing to go on.\"\n\n\"There was no time,\" the creature said. \"Death is stalking our land, and\nthe people are falling at their plows. Thousands of us are dying, tens\nof thousands. Even I am infected and soon will be dead. Unless you can\nfind a way to help us quickly, it will be too late, and my people will\nbe wiped from the face of the planet.\"\n\nJack looked grimly at Tiger and Dal. \"Well,\" he said, \"I guess that\nanswers our question, all right. It looks as if we have a plague planet\non our hands, whether we like it or not.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9\n\nTHE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE\n\n\nSlowly and patiently they drew the story from the emissary from the\nseventh planet of 31 Brucker.\n\nThe small, monkey-like creature was painfully shy; he required constant\nreassurance that the doctors did not mind being called, that they wanted\nto help, and that a contract was not necessary in an emergency. Even at\nthat the spokesman was reluctant to give details about the plague and\nabout his stricken people. Every bit of information had to be extracted\nwith patient questioning.\n\nBy tacit consent the doctors did not even mention the strange fact that\nthis very planet had been explored by a Confederation ship eight hundred\nyears before and no sign of intelligent life had been found. The little\ncreature before them seemed ready to turn and bolt at the first hint of\nattack or accusation. But bit by bit, a picture of the current situation\non the planet developed.\n\nWhoever they were and wherever they had been when the Confederation ship\nhad landed, there was unquestionably an intelligent race now inhabiting\nthis lonely planet in the outer reaches of the solar system of 31\nBrucker. There was no doubt of their advancement; a few well-selected\nquestions revealed that they had control of atomic power, a working\nunderstanding of the nature and properties of contra-terrene matter, and\na workable star drive operating on the same basic principle as Earth's\nKoenig drive but which the Bruckians had never really used because of\ntheir shyness and fear of contact with other races. They also had an\nexcellent understanding, thanks to their eavesdropping on Confederation\ninterstellar radio chatter, of the existence and functions of the\nGalactic Confederation of worlds, and of Hospital Earth's work as\nphysician to the galaxy.\n\nBut about Bruckian anatomy, physiology or biochemistry, the little\nemissary would tell them nothing. He seemed genuinely frightened when\nthey pressed him about the physical make-up of his people, as though\ntheir questions were somehow scraping a raw nerve. He insisted that his\npeople knew nothing about the nature of the plague that had stricken\nthem, and the doctors could not budge him an inch from his stand.\n\nBut a plague had certainly struck.\n\nIt had begun six months before, striking great masses of the people. It\nhad walked the streets of the cities and the hills and valleys of the\ncountryside. First three out of ten had been stricken, then four, then\nfive. The course of the disease, once started, was invariably the same:\nfirst illness, weakness, loss of energy and interest, then gradually a\nfading away of intelligent responses, leaving thousands of creatures\nwalking blank-faced and idiot-like about the streets and countryside.\nUltimately even the ability to take food was lost, and after an interval\nof a week or so, death invariably ensued.\n\nFinally the doctors retired to the control room for a puzzled\nconference. \"It's got to be an organism of some sort that's doing it,\"\nDal said. \"There couldn't be an illness like this that wasn't caused by\nsome kind of a parasitic germ or virus.\"\n\n\"But how do we know?\" Jack said. \"We know nothing about these people\nexcept what we can see. We're going to have to do a complete biochemical\nand medical survey before we can hope to do anything.\"\n\n\"But we aren't equipped for a real survey,\" Tiger protested.\n\n\"We've got to do it anyway,\" Jack said. \"If we can just learn enough to\nbe sure it's an infectious illness, we might stand a chance of finding a\ndrug that will cure it. Or at least a way to immunize the ones that\naren't infected yet. If this is a virus infection, we might only need to\nfind an antibody for inoculation to stop it in its tracks. But first we\nneed a good look at the planet and some more of the people--both\ninfected and healthy ones. We'd better make arrangements as fast as we\ncan.\"\n\nAn hour later they had reached an agreement with the Bruckian emissary.\nThe _Lancet_ would be permitted to land on the planet's surface as soon\nas the doctors were satisfied that it was safe. For the time being the\ninitial landings would be made in the patrol ship's lifeboats, with the\n_Lancet_ in orbit a thousand miles above the surface. Unquestionably the\nfirst job was diagnosis, discovering the exact nature of the illness and\nstudying the afflicted people. This responsibility rested squarely on\nJack's shoulders; he was the diagnostician, and Dal and Tiger willingly\nyielded to him in organizing the program.\n\nIt was decided that Jack and Tiger would visit the planet's surface at\nonce, while Dal stayed on the ship and set up the reagents and\nexamining techniques that would be needed to measure the basic physical\nand biochemical characteristics of the Bruckians.\n\nYet in all the excitement of planning, Dal could not throw off the\nlingering shadow of doubt in his mind, some instinctive voice of caution\nthat seemed to say _watch out, be careful, go slowly! This may not be\nwhat it seems to be; you may be walking into a trap...._\n\nBut it was only a faint voice, and easy to thrust aside as the planning\nwent ahead full speed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt did not take very long for the crew of the _Lancet_ to realize that\nthere was something very odd indeed about the small, self-effacing\ninhabitants of 31 Brucker VII.\n\nIn fact, \"odd\" was not really quite the proper word for these creatures\nat all. No one knew better than the doctors of Hospital Earth that\noddness was the rule among the various members of the galactic\ncivilization. All sorts and varieties of life-forms had been discovered,\ndescribed and studied, each with its singular differences, each with\ncertain similarities, and each quite \"odd\" in reference to any of the\nothers.\n\nIn Dal this awareness of the oddness and difference of other races was\nparticularly acute. He knew that to Tiger and Jack he himself seemed\nodd, both anatomically and in other ways. His fine gray fur and his\nfour-fingered hands set him apart from them--he would never be mistaken\nfor an Earthman, even in the densest fog. But these were comprehensible\ndifferences. His close attachment to Fuzzy was something else, and still\nseemed beyond their ability to understand.\n\nHe had spent one whole evening patiently trying to make Jack understand\njust how his attachment to the little pink creature was more than just\nthe fondness of a man for his dog.\n\n\"Well, what would you call it, then?\"\n\n\"Symbiosis is probably the best word for it,\" Dal had replied. \"Two\nlife-forms live together, and each one helps the other--that's all\nsymbiosis is. Together each one is better off than either one would be\nalone. We all of us live in symbiosis with the bacteria in our digestive\ntracts, don't we? We provide them with a place to live and grow, and\nthey help us digest our food. It's a kind of a partnership--and Fuzzy\nand I are partners in the same sort of way.\"\n\nJack had argued, and then lost his temper, and finally grudgingly agreed\nthat he supposed he would have to tolerate it even if it didn't make\nsense to him.\n\nBut the creatures on 31 Brucker VII were \"odd\" far beyond the reasonable\nlimits of oddness--so far beyond it that the doctors could not believe\nthe things that their eyes and their instruments were telling them.\n\nWhen Tiger and Jack came back to the _Lancet_ after their first trip to\nthe planet's surface, they were visibly shaken. Geographically, they had\nfound it just as it had been described in the exploratory reports--a\nbarren, desert land with only a few large islands of vegetation in the\nequatorial regions.\n\n\"But the people!\" Jack said. \"They don't fit into _any_ kind of pattern.\nThey've got houses--at least I guess you'd call them houses--but every\none of them is like every other one, and they're all crammed together in\ntight little bunches, with nothing for miles in between. They've got an\nadvanced technology, a good communications system, manufacturing\ntechniques and everything, but they just don't use them.\"\n\n\"It's more than that,\" Tiger said. \"They don't seem to _want_ to use\nthem.\"\n\n\"Well, it doesn't add up, to me,\" Jack said. \"There are thousands of\ntowns and cities down there, all of them miles apart, and yet they had\nto go dig an old rusty jet scooter out of storage and get the motor\nrebuilt just specially to take us from one place to another. I know\nthings can get disorganized with a plague in the land, but this plague\njust hasn't been going on that long.\"\n\n\"What about the sickness?\" Dal asked. \"Is it as bad as it sounded?\"\n\n\"Worse, if anything,\" Tiger said gloomily. \"They're dying by the\nthousands, and I hope we got those suits of ours decontaminated, because\nI don't want any part of this disease.\"\n\nGraphically, he described the conditions they had found among the\nstricken people. There was no question that a plague was stalking the\nland. In the rutted mud roads of the villages and towns the dead were\npiled in gutters, and in all of the cities a deathly stillness hung over\nthe streets. Those who had not yet succumbed to the illness were nursing\nand feeding the sick ones, but these unaffected ones were growing\nscarcer and scarcer. The whole living population seemed resigned to\nhopelessness, hardly noticing the strangers from the patrol ship.\n\nBut worst of all were those in the final stages of the disease,\nwandering vaguely about the street, their faces blank and their jaws\nslack as though they were living in a silent world of their own, cut off\nfrom contact with the rest. \"One of them almost ran into me,\" Jack said.\n\"I was right in front of him, and he didn't see me or hear me.\"\n\n\"But don't they have _any_ knowledge of antisepsis or isolation?\" Dal\nasked.\n\nTiger shook his head. \"Not that we could see. They don't know what's\ncausing this sickness. They think that it's some kind of curse, and\nthey never dreamed that it might be kept from spreading.\"\n\nAlready Tiger and Jack had taken the first routine steps to deal with\nthe sickness. They gave orders to move the unaffected people in every\ntown and village into isolated barracks and stockades. For half a day\nTiger tried to explain ways to prevent the spread of a bacteria or\nvirus-borne disease. The people had stared at him as if he were talking\ngibberish; finally he gave up trying to explain, and just laid down\nrules which the people were instructed to follow. Together they had\ncollected standard testing specimens of body fluids and tissue from both\nhealthy and afflicted Bruckians, and come back to the _Lancet_ for a\nbreather.\n\nNow all three doctors began work on the specimens. Cultures were\ninoculated with specimens from respiratory tract, blood and tissue taken\nfrom both sick and well. Half a dozen fatal cases were brought to the\nship under specially controlled conditions for autopsy examination, to\nreveal both the normal anatomical characteristics of this strange race\nof people and the damage the disease was doing. Down on the surface\nTiger had already inoculated a dozen of the healthy ones with various\nradioactive isotopes to help outline the normal metabolism and\nbiochemistry of the people. After a short sleep period on the _Lancet_,\nhe went back down alone to follow up on these, leaving Dal and Jack to\ncarry on the survey work in the ship's lab.\n\nIt was a gargantuan task that faced them. They knew that in any race of\ncreatures they could not hope to recognize the abnormal unless they knew\nwhat the normal was. That was the sole reason for the extensive\nbiomedical surveys that were done on new contract planets. Under normal\nconditions, a survey crew with specialists in physiology, biochemistry,\nanatomy, radiology, pharmacology and pathology might spend months or\neven years on a new planet gathering base-line information. But here\nthere was neither time nor facilities for such a study. Even in the\ntwenty-four hours since the patrol ship arrived, the number of dead had\nincreased alarmingly.\n\nAlone on the ship, Dal and Jack found themselves working as a well\norganized team. There was no time here for argument or duplicated\nefforts; everything the two doctors did was closely co-ordinated. Jack\nseemed to have forgotten his previous antagonism completely. There was a\ncrisis here, and more work than three men could possibly do in the time\navailable. \"You handle anatomy and pathology,\" Jack told Dal at the\nbeginning. \"You can get the picture five times as fast as I can, and\nyour pathology slides are better than most commercial ones. I can do the\nbest job on the cultures, once I get the growth media all set up.\"\n\nBit by bit they divided the labor, checking in with Tiger by radio on\nthe results of the isotopes studies he was running on the planet's\nsurface. Bit by bit the data was collected, and Earthman and Garvian\nworked more closely than ever before as the task that faced them\nappeared more and more formidable.\n\nBut the results of their tests made no sense whatever. Tiger returned to\nthe ship after forty-eight hours with circles under his eyes, looking as\nthough he had been trampled in a crowd. \"No sleep, that's all,\" he said\nbreathlessly as he crawled out of his decontaminated pressure suit. \"No\ntime for it. I swear I ran those tests a dozen times and I still didn't\nget any answers that made sense.\"\n\n\"The results you were sending up sounded plenty strange,\" Jack said.\n\"What was the trouble?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Tiger said, \"but if we're looking for a biological\npattern here, we haven't found it yet as far as I can see.\"\n\n\"No, we certainly haven't,\" Dal exploded. \"I thought I was doing\nsomething wrong somehow, because these blood chemistries I've been doing\nhave been ridiculous. I can't even find a normal level for blood sugar,\nand as for the enzyme systems....\" He tossed a sheaf of notes down on\nthe counter in disgust. \"I don't see how these people could even be\nalive, with a botched-up metabolism like this! I've never heard of\nanything like it.\"\n\n\"What kind of pathology did you find?\" Tiger wanted to know.\n\n\"Nothing,\" Dal said. \"Nothing at all. I did autopsies on the six that\nyou brought up here and made slides of every different kind of tissue I\ncould find. The anatomy is perfectly clear cut, no objections there.\nThese people are very similar to Earth-type monkeys in structure, with\nheart and lungs and vocal cords and all. But I can't find any reason why\nthey should be dying. Any luck with the cultures?\"\n\nJack shook his head glumly. \"No growth on any of the plates. At first I\nthought I had something going, but if I did, it died, and I can't find\nany sign of it in the filtrates.\"\n\n\"But we've got to have _something_ to work on,\" Tiger said desperately.\n\"Look, there are some things that always measure out the same in _any_\nintelligent creature no matter where he comes from. That's the whole\nbasis of galactic medicine. Creatures may develop and adapt in different\nways, but the basic biochemical reactions are the same.\"\n\n\"Not here, they aren't,\" Dal said. \"Take a look at these tests!\"\n\nThey carried the heap of notes they had collected out into the control\nroom and began sifting and organizing the data, just as a survey team\nwould do, trying to match it with the pattern of a thousand other\nliving creatures that had previously been studied. Hours passed, and\nthey were farther from an answer than when they began.\n\nBecause this data did not fit a pattern. It was _different_. No two\nindividuals showed the same reactions. In every test the results were\neither flatly impossible or completely the opposite of what was\nexpected.\n\nCarefully they retraced their steps, trying to pinpoint what could be\ngoing wrong.\n\n\"There's _got_ to be a laboratory error,\" Dal said wearily. \"We must\nhave slipped up somewhere.\"\n\n\"But I don't see where,\" Jack said. \"Let's see those culture tubes\nagain. And put on a pot of coffee. I can't even think straight any\nmore.\"\n\nOf the three of them, Jack was beginning to show the strain the most.\nThis was his special field, the place where he was supposed to excel,\nand nothing was happening. Reports coming up from the planet were\ndiscouraging; the isolation techniques they had tried to institute did\nnot seem to be working, and the spread of the plague was accelerating.\nThe communiqu\u00e9s from the Bruckians were taking on a note of desperation.\n\nJack watched each report with growing apprehension. He moved restlessly\nfrom lab to control room, checking and rechecking things, trying to find\nsome sign of order in the chaos.\n\n\"Try to get some sleep,\" Dal urged him. \"A couple of hours will freshen\nyou up a hundred per cent.\"\n\n\"I can't, I've already tried it,\" Jack said.\n\n\"Go ahead. Tiger and I can keep working on these things for a while.\"\n\n\"No, no, it's not that,\" Jack said. \"Without a diagnosis, we can't do a\nthing. Until we have that, our hands are tied, and we aren't even\ngetting close to it. We don't even know whether this is a bacteria, or a\nvirus, or what. Maybe the Bruckians are right. Maybe it's a curse.\"\n\n\"I don't think the Black Service of Pathology would buy that for a\ndiagnosis,\" Tiger said sourly.\n\n\"The Black Service would choke on it--but what other answer do we have?\nYou two have been doing all you can, but diagnosis is _my_ job. I'm\nsupposed to be good at it, but the more we dig into this, the farther\naway we seem to get.\"\n\n\"Do you want to call for help?\" Tiger said.\n\nJack shook his head helplessly. \"I'm beginning to think we should have\ncalled for help a long time ago,\" he said. \"We're into this over our\nheads now and we're still going down. At the rate those people are dying\ndown there, we don't have time to call for help now.\" He stared at the\npiles of notes on the desk and his face was very white. \"I don't know, I\njust don't know,\" he said. \"The diagnosis on this thing should have been\nduck soup. I thought it was going to be a real feather in my cap, just\nwalking in and nailing it down in a few hours. Well, I'm whipped. I\ndon't know what to do. If either of you can think of an answer, it's all\nyours, and I'll admit it to Black Doctor Tanner himself.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was bitter medicine for Blue Doctor Jack Alvarez to swallow, but that\nfact gave no pleasure to Dal or Tiger now. They were as baffled as Jack\nwas, and would have welcomed help from anyone who could offer it.\n\nAnd, ironically, the first glimpse of the truth came from the direction\nthey least expected.\n\nFrom the very beginning Fuzzy had been watching the proceedings from his\nperch on the swinging platform in the control room. If he sensed that\nDal Timgar was ignoring him and leaving him to his own devices much of\nthe time, he showed no sign of resentment. The tiny creature seemed to\nrealize that something important was consuming his master's energy and\nattention, and contented himself with an affectionate pat now and then\nas Dal went through the control room. Everyone assumed without much\nthought that Fuzzy was merely being tolerant of the situation. It was\nnot until they had finally given up in desperation and Tiger was trying\nto contact a Hospital Ship for help, that Dal stared up at his little\npink friend with a puzzled frown.\n\nTiger put the transmitter down for a moment. \"What's wrong?\" he said to\nDal. \"You look as though you just bit into a rotten apple.\"\n\n\"I just remembered that I haven't fed him for twenty-four hours,\" Dal\nsaid.\n\n\"Who? Fuzzy?\" Tiger shrugged. \"He could see you were busy.\"\n\nDal shook his head. \"That wouldn't make any difference to Fuzzy. When he\ngets hungry, he gets hungry, and he's pretty self-centered. It wouldn't\nmatter what I was doing, he should have been screaming for food hours\nago.\"\n\nDal walked over to the platform and peered down at his pink friend in\nalarm. He took him up and rested him on his shoulder, a move that\ninvariably sent Fuzzy into raptures of delight. Now the little creature\njust sat there, trembling and rubbing half-heartedly against Dal's neck.\n\nDal held him out at arm's length. \"Fuzzy, _what's the matter with you?_\"\n\n\"Do you think something's wrong with him?\" Jack said, looking up\nsuddenly. \"Looks like he's having trouble keeping his eyes open.\"\n\n\"His color isn't right, either,\" Tiger said. \"He looks kind of blue.\"\n\nQuite suddenly the little black eyes closed and Fuzzy began to tremble\nviolently. He drew himself up into a tight pink globule as the fuzz-like\nhair disappeared from view.\n\nSomething was unmistakably wrong. As he held the shivering creature, Dal\nwas suddenly aware that something had been nibbling at the back of his\nmind for hours. Not a clear-cut thought, merely an impression of pain\nand anguish and sickness, and now as he looked at Fuzzy the impression\ngrew so strong it almost made him cry out.\n\nAbruptly, Dal knew what he had to do. Where the thought came from he\ndidn't know, but it was crystal clear in his mind. \"Jack, where is our\nbiggest virus filter?\" he asked quietly.\n\nJack stared at him. \"Virus filter? I just took it out of the autoclave\nan hour ago.\"\n\n\"Get it,\" Dal said, \"and the suction machine too. _Quickly!_\"\n\nJack went down the corridor like a shot, and reappeared a moment later\nwith the big porcelain virus filter and the suction tubing attached to\nit. Swiftly Dal dumped the limp little creature in his hand into the top\nof the filter jar, poured in some sterile saline, and started the\nsuction.\n\nTiger and Jack watched him in amazement. \"What are you doing?\" Tiger\nsaid.\n\n\"Filtering him,\" Dal said. \"He's infected. He must have been exposed to\nthe plague somehow, maybe when our little Bruckian visitor came on board\nthe other day. And if it's a virus that's causing this plague, the virus\nfilter ought to hold it back and still let Fuzzy's molecular structure\nthrough.\"\n\nThey watched and sure enough a bluish-pink fluid began moving down\nthrough the porcelain filter, and dripping through the funnel into the\nbeaker below. Each drop coalesced in the beaker as it fell until Fuzzy's\nwhole body had been sucked through the filter and into the jar below. He\nwas still not quite his normal pink color, but as the filter went dry,\na pair of frightened shoe-button eyes appeared and he poked up a pair of\nears. Presently the fuzz began appearing on his body again.\n\nAnd on the top of the filter lay a faint gray film. \"Don't touch it!\"\nDal said. \"That's real poison.\" He slipped on a mask and gloves, and\nscraped a bit of the film from the filter with a spatula. \"I think we\nhave it,\" he said. \"The virus that's causing the plague on this\nplanet.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\nTHE BOOMERANG CLUE\n\n\nIt was a virus, beyond doubt. The electron microscope told them that,\nnow that they had the substance isolated and could examine it. In the\nculture tubes in the _Lancet_'s incubators, it would begin to grow\nnicely, and then falter and die, but when guinea pigs were inoculated in\nthe ship's laboratory, the substance proved its virulence. The animals\ninjected with tiny bits of the substance grew sick within hours and very\nquickly died.\n\nThe call to the Hospital Ship was canceled as the three doctors worked\nin feverish excitement. Here at last was something they could grapple\nwith, something so common among the races of the galaxy that the doctors\nfelt certain that they could cope with it. Very few, if any, higher life\nforms existed that did not have some sort of submicroscopic parasite\nafflicting them. Bacterial infection was a threat on every inhabited\nworld, and the viruses--the tiniest of all submicroscopic\norganisms--were the most difficult and dangerous of them all.\n\nAnd yet virus plagues had been stopped before, and they could be stopped\nagain.\n\nJack radioed down to the planet's surface that the diagnosis had been\nmade; as soon as the proper medications could be prepared, the doctors\nwould land to begin treatment. There was a new flicker of hopefulness in\nthe Bruckian's response, and an appeal to hurry. With renewed energy the\ndoctors went back to the lab to start working on the new data.\n\nBut trouble continued to dog them. This was no ordinary virus. It proved\nresistant to every one of the antibiotics and antiviral agents in the\n_Lancet_'s stockroom. No drug seemed to affect it, and its molecular\nstructure was different from any virus that had ever been recorded\nbefore.\n\n\"If one of the drugs would only just slow it up a little, we'd be\nahead,\" Tiger said in perplexity. \"We don't have anything that even\ntouches it, not even the purified globulins.\"\n\n\"What about antibodies from the infected people?\" Jack suggested. \"In\nevery virus disease I've ever heard of, the victim's own body starts\nmaking antibodies against the invading virus. If enough antibodies are\nmade fast enough, the virus dies and the patient is immune from then\non.\"\n\n\"Well, these people don't seem to be making any antibodies at all,\"\nTiger said. \"At least not as far as I can see. If they were, at least\nsome of them would be recovering from the disease. So far not a single\none has recovered once the thing started. They all just go ahead and\ndie.\"\n\n\"I wonder,\" Dal said, \"if Fuzzy had any defense.\"\n\nJack looked up. \"How do you mean?\"\n\n\"Well, Fuzzy was infected, we know that. He might have died too, if we\nhadn't caught it in time--but as it worked out, he didn't. In fact, he\nlooks pretty healthy right now.\"\n\n\"That's fine for Fuzzy,\" Jack said impatiently, \"but I don't see how we\ncan push the whole population of 31 Brucker VII through a virus filter.\nThey're flesh-and-blood creatures.\"\n\n\"That's not what I mean,\" Dal said. \"Maybe Fuzzy's body developed\nantibodies against the virus while he was infected. Remember, he doesn't\nhave a rigid body structure like we do. He's mostly just basic protein,\nand he can synthesize pretty much anything he wants to or needs to.\"\n\nJack blinked. \"It's an idea, at least. Is there any way we can get some\nof his body fluid away from him? Without getting bit, I mean?\"\n\n\"No problem there,\" Dal said. \"He can regenerate pretty fast if he has\nenough of the right kind of food. He won't miss an ounce or two of\nexcess tissue.\"\n\nHe took a beaker over to Fuzzy's platform and began squeezing off a\nlittle blob of pink material. Fuzzy seemed to sense what Dal wanted;\nobligingly he thrust out a little pseudopod which Dal pinched off into\nthe beaker. With the addition of a small amount of saline solution, the\ntissue dissolved into thin, pink suspension.\n\nIn the laboratory they found two or three of the guinea pigs in the last\nstages of the infection, and injected them with a tiny bit of the pink\nsolution. The effect was almost unbelievable. Within twenty minutes all\nof the injected animals began to perk up, their eyes brighter, nibbling\nat the food in their cages, while the ones that had not been injected\ngot sicker and sicker.\n\n\"Well, there's our answer,\" Jack said eagerly. \"If we can get some of\nthis stuff injected into our friends down below, we may be able to\nprotect the healthy ones from getting the plague, and cure the sick ones\nas well. If we still have enough time, that is.\"\n\nThey had landing permission from the Bruckian spokesman within minutes,\nand an hour later the _Lancet_ made an orderly landing on a\nnewly-repaved landing field near one of the central cities on the\nseventh planet of 31 Brucker.\n\nTiger and Jack had obviously not exaggerated the strange appearance of\nthe towns and cities on this plague-ridden planet, and Dal was appalled\nat the ravages of the disease that they had come to fight. Only one out\nof ten of the Bruckians was still uninfected, and another three out of\nthe ten were clearly in the late stages of the disease, walking about\nblankly and blindly, stumbling into things in their paths, falling to\nthe ground and lying mute and helpless until death came to release them.\nUnder the glaring red sun, weary parties of stretcher bearers went about\nthe silent streets, moving their grim cargo out to the mass graves at\nthe edge of the city.\n\nThe original spokesman who had come up to the _Lancet_ was dead, but\nanother had taken his place as negotiator with the doctors--an older,\nthinner Bruckian who looked as if he carried the total burden of his\npeople on his shoulders. He greeted them eagerly at the landing field.\n\"You have found a solution!\" he cried. \"You have found a way to turn the\ntide--but hurry! Every moment now is precious.\"\n\nDuring the landing procedures, Dal had worked to prepare enough of the\nprecious antibody suspension, with Fuzzy's co-operation, to handle a\nlarge number of inoculations. By the time the ship touched down he had a\ndozen flasks and several hundred syringes ready. Hundreds of the\nunafflicted people were crowding around the ship, staring in open wonder\nas Dal, Jack and Tiger came down the ladder and went into close\nconference with the spokesman.\n\nIt took some time to explain to the spokesman why they could not begin\nthen and there with the mass inoculations against the plague. First,\nthey needed test cases, in order to make certain that what they thought\nwould work in theory actually produced the desired results. Controls\nwere needed, to be certain that the antibody suspension alone was\nbringing about the changes seen and not something else. At last, orders\nwent out from the spokesman. Two hundred uninfected Bruckians were\nadmitted to a large roped-off area near the ship, and another two\nhundred in late stages of the disease were led stumbling into another\nclosed area. Preliminary skin-tests of the antibody suspension showed no\nsign of untoward reaction. Dal began filling syringes while Tiger and\nJack started inoculating the two groups.\n\n\"If it works with these cases, it will be simple to immunize the whole\npopulation,\" Tiger said. \"From the amounts we used on the guinea pigs,\nit looks as if only tiny amounts are needed. We may even be able to\ntrain the Bruckians to give the injections themselves.\"\n\n\"And if it works we ought to have a brand new medical service contract\nready for signature with Hospital Earth,\" Jack added eagerly. \"It won't\nbe long before we have those Stars, you wait and see! If we can only get\nthis done fast enough.\"\n\nThey worked feverishly, particularly with the group of terminal cases.\nMany were dying even as the shots were being given, while the first\nsymptoms of the disease were appearing in some of the unafflicted ones.\nSwiftly Tiger and Jack went from patient to patient while Dal kept check\nof the names, numbers and locations of those that were inoculated.\n\nAnd even before they were finished with the inoculations, it was\napparent that they were taking effect. Not one of the infected patients\ndied after inoculation was completed. The series took three hours, and\nby the time the four hundred doses were administered, one thing seemed\ncertain: that the antibody was checking the deadly march of the disease\nin some way.\n\nThe Bruckian spokesman was so excited he could hardly contain himself;\nhe wanted to start bringing in the rest of the population at once.\n\"We've almost exhausted this first batch of the material,\" Dal told him.\n\"We will have to prepare more--but we will waste time trying to move a\nwhole planet's population here. Get a dozen aircraft ready, and a dozen\nhealthy, intelligent workers to help us. We can show them how to use the\nmaterial, and let them go out to the other population centers all at\nonce.\"\n\nBack aboard the ship they started preparing a larger quantity of the\nantibody suspension. Fuzzy had regenerated back to normal weight again,\nand much to Dal's delight had been splitting off small segments of pink\nprotoplasm in a circle all around him, as though anticipating further\ndemands on his resources. A quick test-run showed that the antibody was\nalso being regenerated. Fuzzy was voraciously hungry, but the material\nin the second batch was still as powerful as in the first.\n\nThe doctors were almost ready to go back down, loaded with enough\ninoculum and syringes to equip themselves and a dozen field workers when\nJack suddenly stopped what he was doing and cocked an ear toward the\nentrance lock.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Dal said.\n\n\"Listen a minute.\"\n\nThey stopped to listen. \"I don't hear anything,\" Tiger said.\n\nJack nodded. \"I know. That's what I mean. They were hollering their\nheads off when we came back aboard. Why so quiet now?\"\n\nHe crossed over to the viewscreen scanning the field below, and flipped\non the switch. For a moment he just stared. Then he said: \"Come here a\nminute. I don't like the looks of this at all.\"\n\nDal and Tiger crowded up to the screen. \"What's the matter?\" Tiger said.\n\"I don't see ... _wait a minute!_\"\n\n\"Yes, you'd better look again,\" Jack said. \"What do you think, Dal?\"\n\n\"We'd better get down there fast,\" Dal said, \"and see what's going on.\nIt looks to me like we've got a tiger by the tail....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey climbed down the ladder once again, with the antibody flasks and\nsterile syringes strapped to their backs. But this time the greeting was\ndifferent from before.\n\nThe Bruckian spokesman and the others who had not yet been inoculated\ndrew back from them in terror as they stepped to the ground. Before, the\npeople on the field had crowded in eagerly around the ship; now they\nwere standing in silent groups staring at the doctors fearfully and\nmuttering among themselves.\n\nBut the doctors could see only the inoculated people in the two\nroped-off areas. Off to the right among the infected Bruckians who had\nreceived the antibody there were no new dead--but there was no change\nfor the better, either. The sick creatures drifted about aimlessly,\nmilling like animals in a cage, their faces blank, their jaws slack,\nhands wandering foolishly. Not one of them had begun reacting normally,\nnot one showed any sign of recognition or recovery.\n\nBut the real horror was on the other side of the field. Here were the\nhealthy ones, the uninfected ones who had received preventative\ninoculations. A few hours before they had been left standing in quiet,\nhappy groups, talking among themselves, laughing and joking....\n\nBut now they weren't talking any more. They stared across at the doctors\nwith slack faces and dazed eyes, their feet shuffling aimlessly in the\ndust. All were alive, but only half-alive. The intelligence and\nalertness were gone from their faces; they were like the empty shells of\nthe creatures they had been a few hours before, indistinguishable from\nthe infected creatures in the other compound.\n\nJack turned to the Bruckian spokesman in alarm. \"What's happened here?\"\nhe asked. \"What's become of the ones we inoculated? Where have you taken\nthem?\"\n\nThe spokesman shrank back as though afraid Jack might reach out to touch\nhim. \"Taken them!\" he cried. \"We have moved none of them! Those are the\nones you poisoned with your needles. What have you done to make them\nlike this?\"\n\n\"It--it must be some sort of temporary reaction to the injection,\" Jack\nfaltered. \"There was nothing that we used that could possibly have given\nthem the disease, we only used a substance to help them fight it off.\"\n\nThe Bruckian was shaking his fist angrily. \"It's no reaction, it is the\nplague itself! What kind of evil are you doing? You came here to help\nus, and instead you bring us more misery. Do we not have enough of that\nto please you?\"\n\nSwiftly the doctors began examining the patients in both enclosures, and\non each side they found the same picture. One by one they checked the\nones that had previously been untouched by the plague, and found only\nthe sagging jaws and idiot stares.\n\n\"There's no sense examining every one,\" Tiger said finally. \"They're all\nthe same, every one.\"\n\n\"But this is impossible,\" Jack said, glancing apprehensively at the\ngrowing mob of angry Bruckians outside the stockades. \"What could have\nhappened? What have we done?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Tiger said. \"But whatever we've done has turned into a\nboomerang. We knew that the antibody might not work, and the disease\nmight just go right ahead, but we didn't anticipate anything like this.\"\n\n\"Maybe some foreign protein got into the batch,\" Dal said.\n\nTiger shook his head. \"It wouldn't behave like _this_. And we were\ncareful getting it ready. All we've done was inject an antibody against\na specific virus. All it could have done was to kill the virus, but\nthese people act as though they're infected now.\"\n\n\"But they're not dying,\" Dal said. \"And the sick ones we injected\nstopped dying, too.\"\n\n\"So what do we do now?\" Jack said.\n\n\"Get one of these that changed like this aboard ship and go over him\nwith a fine-toothed comb. We've got to find out what's happened.\"\n\nHe led one of the stricken Bruckians by the hand like a mindless dummy\nacross the field toward the little group where the spokesman and his\nparty stood. The crowd on the field were moving in closer; an angry cry\nwent up when Dal touched the sick creature.\n\n\"You'll have to keep this crowd under control,\" Dal said to the\nspokesman. \"We're going to take this one aboard the ship and examine him\nto see what this reaction could be, but this mob is beginning to sound\ndangerous.\"\n\n\"They're afraid,\" the spokesman said. \"They want to know what you've\ndone to them, what this new curse is that you bring in your syringes.\"\n\n\"It's not a curse, but something has gone wrong. We need to learn what,\nin order to deal with it.\"\n\n\"The people are afraid and angry,\" the spokesman said. \"I don't know how\nlong I can control them.\"\n\nAnd indeed, the attitude of the crowd around the ship was very strange.\nThey were not just fearful; they were terrified. As the doctors walked\nback to the ship leading the stricken Bruckian behind them, the people\nshrank back with dreadful cries, holding up their hands as if to ward\noff some monstrous evil. Before, in the worst throes of the plague,\nthere had been no sign of this kind of reaction. The people had seemed\napathetic and miserable, resigned hopelessly to their fate, but now they\nwere reacting in abject terror. It almost seemed that they were more\nafraid of these walking shells of their former selves than they were of\nthe disease itself.\n\nBut as the doctors started up the ladder toward the entrance lock the\ncrowd surged in toward them with fists raised in anger. \"We'd better get\nhelp, and fast,\" Jack said as he slammed the entrance lock closed behind\nthem. \"I don't like the looks of this a bit. Dal, we'd better see what\nwe can learn from this poor creature here.\"\n\nAs Tiger headed for the earphones, Dal and Jack went to work once again,\nchecking the blood and other body fluids from the stricken Bruckian. But\nnow, incredibly, the results of their tests were quite different from\nthose they had obtained before. The blood sugar and protein\ndeterminations fell into the pattern they had originally expected for a\ncreature of this type. Even more surprising, the level of the antibody\nagainst the plague virus was high--far higher than it could have been\nfrom the tiny amount that was injected into the creature.\n\n\"They must have been making it themselves,\" Dal said, \"and our\ninoculation was just the straw that broke the camel's back. All of those\npeople must have been on the brink of symptoms of the infection, and\nall we did was add to the natural defenses they were already making.\"\n\n\"Then why did the symptoms appear?\" Jack said. \"If that's true, we\nshould have been _helping_ them, and look at them now!\"\n\nTiger appeared at the door, scowling. \"We've got real trouble, now,\" he\nsaid. \"I can't get through to a hospital ship. In fact, I can't get a\nmessage out at all. These people are jamming our radios.\"\n\n\"But why?\" Dal said.\n\n\"I don't know, but take a look outside there.\"\n\nThrough the viewscreen it seemed as though the whole field around the\nship had filled up with the crowd. The first reaction of terror now\nseemed to have given way to blind fury; the people were shouting\nangrily, waving their clenched fists at the ship as the spokesman tried\nto hold them back.\n\nThen there was a resounding crash from somewhere below, and the ship\nlurched, throwing the doctors to the floor. They staggered to their feet\nas another blow jolted the ship, and another.\n\n\"Let's get a screen up,\" Tiger shouted. \"Jack, get the engines going.\nThey're trying to board us, and I don't think it'll be much fun if they\never break in.\"\n\nIn the control room they threw the switches that activated a powerful\nprotective energy screen around the ship. It was a device that was\ncarried by all GPP Ships as a means of protection against physical\nattack. When activated, an energy screen was virtually impregnable, but\nit could only be used briefly; the power it required placed an enormous\ndrain on a ship's energy resources, and a year's nuclear fuel could be\nconsumed in a few hours.\n\nNow the screen served its purpose. The ship steadied, still vibrating\nfrom the last assault, and the noise from below ceased abruptly. But\nwhen Jack threw the switches to start the engines, nothing happened at\nall.\n\n\"Look at that!\" he cried, staring at the motionless dials. \"They're\njamming our electrical system somehow. I can't get any turn-over.\"\n\n\"Try it again,\" Tiger said. \"We've got to get out of here. If they break\nin, we're done for.\"\n\n\"They can't break through the screen,\" Dal said.\n\n\"Not as long as it lasts. But we can't keep it up indefinitely.\"\n\nOnce again they tried the radio equipment. There was no response but the\nharsh static of the jamming signal from the ground below. \"It's no\ngood,\" Tiger said finally. \"We're stuck here, and we can't even call for\nhelp. You'd think if they were so scared of us they'd be glad to see us\ngo.\"\n\n\"I think there's more to it than that,\" Dal said thoughtfully. \"This\nwhole business has been crazy from the start. This just fits in with all\nthe rest.\" He picked Fuzzy off his perch and set him on his shoulder as\nif to protect him from some unsuspected threat. \"Maybe they're afraid of\nus, I don't know. But I think they're afraid of something else a whole\nlot worse.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was nothing to be done but wait and stare hopelessly at the mass\nof notes and records that they had collected on the people of 31 Brucker\nVII and the plague that afflicted them.\n\nUntil now, the _Lancet_'s crew had been too busy to stop and piece the\ndata together, to try to see the picture as a whole. But now there was\nample time, and the realization of what had been happening here began to\ndawn on them.\n\nThey had followed the well-established principles step by step in\nstudying these incredible people, and nothing had come out as it should.\nIn theory, the steps they had taken should have yielded the answer. They\nhad come to a planet where an entire population was threatened with a\ndreadful disease. They had identified the disease, found and isolated\nthe virus that caused it, and then developed an antibody that\neffectively destroyed the virus--in the laboratory. But when they had\ntried to apply the antibody in the afflicted patients, the response had\nbeen totally unexpected. They had stopped the march of death among those\nthey had inoculated, and had produced instead a condition that the\npeople seemed to dread far more than death.\n\n\"Let's face it,\" Dal said, \"we bungled it somehow. We should have had\nhelp here right from the start. I don't know where we went wrong, but\nwe've done something.\"\n\n\"Well, it wasn't your fault,\" Jack said gloomily. \"If we had the right\ndiagnosis, this wouldn't have happened. And I _still_ can't see the\ndiagnosis. All I've been able to come up with is a nice mess.\"\n\n\"We're missing something, that's all,\" Dal said. \"The information is all\nhere. We just aren't reading it right, somehow. Somewhere in here is a\nkey to the whole thing, and we just can't see it.\"\n\nThey went back to the data again, going through it step by step. This\nwas Jack Alvarez's specialty--the technique of diagnosis, the ability to\ntake all the available information about a race and about its illness\nand piece it together into a pattern that made sense. Dal could see that\nJack was now bitterly angry with himself, yet at every turn he seemed to\nstrike another obstacle--some fact that didn't jibe, a missing fragment\nhere, a wrong answer there. With Dal and Tiger helping he started back\nover the sequence of events, trying to make sense out of them, and came\nup squarely against a blank wall.\n\nThe things they had done should have worked; instead, they had failed. A\nspecific antibody used against a specific virus should have destroyed\nthe virus or slowed its progress, and there seemed to be no rational\nexplanation for the dreadful response of the uninfected ones who had\nbeen inoculated for protection.\n\nAnd as the doctors sifted through the data, the Bruckian they had\nbrought up from the enclosure sat staring off into space, making small\nnoises with his mouth and moving his arms aimlessly. After a while they\nled him back to a bunk, gave him a medicine for sleep and left him\nsnoring gently. Another hour passed as they pored over their notes, with\nTiger stopping from time to time to mop perspiration from his forehead.\nAll three were aware of the moving clock hands, marking off the minutes\nthat the force screen could hold out.\n\nAnd then Dal Timgar was digging into the pile of papers, searching\nfrantically for something he could not find. \"That first report we got,\"\nhe said hoarsely. \"There was something in the very first information we\never saw on this planet....\"\n\n\"You mean the Confederation's data? It's in the radio log.\" Tiger pulled\nopen the thick log book. \"But what....\"\n\n\"It's there, plain as day, I'm sure of it,\" Dal said. He read through\nthe report swiftly, until he came to the last paragraph--a two-line\ndescription of the largest creatures the original Exploration Ship had\nfound on the planet, described by them as totally unintelligent and only\nobserved on a few occasions in the course of the exploration. Dal read\nit, and his hands were trembling as he handed the report to Jack. \"I\nknew the answer was there!\" he said. \"Take a look at that again and\nthink about it for a minute.\"\n\nJack read it through. \"I don't see what you mean,\" he said.\n\n\"I mean that I think we've made a horrible mistake,\" Dal said, \"and I\nthink I see now what it was. We've had this whole thing exactly 100 per\ncent backward from the start, and that explains everything that's\nhappened here!\"\n\nTiger peered over Jack's shoulder at the report. \"Backward?\"\n\n\"As backward as we could get it,\" Dal said. \"We've assumed all along\nthat these flesh-and-blood creatures down there were the ones that were\ncalling us for help because of a virus plague that was attacking and\nkilling them. All right, look at it the other way. Just suppose that the\nintelligent creature that called us for help was the _virus_, and that\nthose flesh-and-blood creatures down there with the blank, stupid faces\nare the _real_ plague we ought to have been fighting all along!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11\n\nDAL BREAKS A PROMISE\n\n\nFor a moment the others just stared at their Garvian crewmate. Then Jack\nAlvarez snorted. \"You'd better go back and get some rest,\" he said.\n\"This has been a tougher grind than I thought. You're beginning to show\nthe strain.\"\n\n\"No, I mean it,\" Dal said earnestly. \"I think that is exactly what's\nbeen happening.\"\n\nTiger looked at him with concern. \"Dal, this is no time for double talk\nand nonsense.\"\n\n\"It's not nonsense,\" Dal said. \"It's the answer, if you'll only stop and\nthink.\"\n\n\"An intelligent _virus_?\" Jack said. \"Who ever heard of such a thing?\nThere's never been a life-form like that reported since the beginning of\nthe galactic exploration.\"\n\n\"But that doesn't mean there couldn't be one,\" Dal said. \"And how would\nan exploratory crew ever identify it, if it existed? How would they ever\neven suspect it? They'd miss it completely--unless it happened to get\ninto trouble itself and try to call for help!\" Dal jumped up in\nexcitement.\n\n\"Look, I've seen a dozen articles showing how such a thing was\ntheoretically possible ... a virus life-form with billions of\nsubmicroscopic parts acting together to form an intelligent colony. The\nonly thing a virus-creature would need that other intelligent creatures\ndon't need would be some kind of a host, some sort of animal body to\nlive in so that it could use its intelligence.\"\n\n\"It's impossible,\" Jack said scornfully. \"Why don't you give it up and\nget some rest? Here we sit with our feet in the fire, and all you can do\nis dream up foolishness like this.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure it's foolishness,\" Tiger Martin said slowly. \"Jack,\nmaybe he's got something. A couple of things would fit that don't make\nsense at all.\"\n\n\"All sorts of things would fit,\" Dal said. \"The viruses we know have to\nhave a host--some other life-form to live in. Usually they are\nparasites, damaging or destroying their hosts and giving nothing in\nreturn, but some set up real partnership housekeeping with their hosts\nso that both are better off.\"\n\n\"You mean a symbiotic relationship,\" Jack said.\n\n\"Of course,\" Dal said. \"Now suppose these virus-creatures were\nintelligent, and came from some other place looking for a new host they\ncould live with. They wouldn't look for an intelligent creature, they\nwould look for some _unintelligent_ creature with a good strong body\nthat would be capable of doing all sorts of things if it only had an\nintelligence to guide it. Suppose these virus-creatures found a\nsimple-minded, unintelligent race on this planet and tried to set up a\nsymbiotic relationship with it. The virus-creatures would need a host to\nprovide a home and a food supply. Maybe they in turn could supply the\nintelligence to raise the host to a civilized level of life and\nperformance. Wouldn't that be a fair basis for a sound partnership?\"\n\nJack scratched his head doubtfully. \"And you're saying that these\nvirus-creatures came here after the exploratory ship had come and gone?\"\n\n\"They must have! Maybe they only came a few years ago, maybe only months\nago. But when they tried to invade the unintelligent creatures the\nexploratory ship found here, they discovered that the new host's body\ncouldn't tolerate them. His body reacted as if they were parasitic\ninvaders, and built up antibodies against them. And those body defenses\nwere more than the virus could cope with.\"\n\nDal pointed to the piles of notes on the desk. \"Don't you see how it\nadds up? Right from the beginning we've been assuming that these\nmonkey-like creatures here on this planet were the dominant, intelligent\nlife-forms. Anatomically they were ordinary cellular creatures like you\nand me, and when we examined them we expected to find the same sort of\nbiochemical reactions we'd find with any such creatures. And all our\nresults came out wrong, because we were dealing with a combination of\ntwo creatures--the host and a virus. Maybe the creatures on 31 Brucker\nVII were naturally blank-faced idiots before the virus came, or maybe\nthe virus was forced to damage some vital part just in order to fight\nback--but it was the _virus_ that was being killed by its own host, not\nthe other way around.\"\n\nJack studied the idea, no longer scornful. \"So you think the\nvirus-creatures called for help, hoping we could find some way to free\nthem from the hosts that were killing them. And when Fuzzy developed a\npowerful antibody against them, and we started using the stuff--\" Jack\nbroke off, shaking his head in horror. \"Dal, if you're right, we were\nliterally _slaughtering our own patients_ when we gave those injections\ndown there!\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" Dal said. \"Is it any wonder they're so scared of us now? It\nmust have looked like a deliberate attempt to wipe them out, and now\nthey're afraid that we'll go get help and _really_ move in against\nthem.\"\n\nTiger nodded. \"Which was precisely what we were planning, if you stop to\nthink about it. Maybe that was why they were so reluctant to tell us\nanything about themselves. Maybe they've already been mistaken for\nparasitic invaders before, wherever in the universe they came from.\"\n\n\"But if this is true, then we're really in a jam,\" Jack said. \"What can\nwe possibly do for them? We can't even repair the damage that we've\nalready done. What sort of treatment can we use?\"\n\nDal shook his head. \"I don't know the answer to that one, but I do know\nwe've got to find out if we're right. An intelligent virus-creature has\nas much right to life as any other intelligent life-form. If we've\nguessed right, then there's a lot that our intelligent friends down\nthere haven't told us. Maybe there'll be some clue there. We've just got\nto face them with it, and see what they say.\"\n\nJack looked at the viewscreen, at the angry mob milling around on the\nground, held back from the ship by the energy screen. \"You mean just go\nout there and say, 'Look fellows, it was all a mistake, we didn't really\nmean to do it?'\" He shook his head. \"Maybe you want to tell them. Not\nme!\"\n\n\"Dal's right, though,\" Tiger said. \"We've got to contact them somehow.\nThey aren't even responding to radio communication, and they've\nscrambled our outside radio and fouled our drive mechanism somehow.\nWe've got to settle this while we still have an energy screen.\"\n\nThere was a long silence as the three doctors looked at each other. Then\nDal stood up and walked over to the swinging platform. He lifted Fuzzy\ndown onto his shoulder. \"It'll be all right,\" he said to Jack and\nTiger. \"I'll go out.\"\n\n\"They'll tear you to ribbons!\" Tiger protested.\n\nDal shook his head. \"I don't think so,\" he said quietly. \"I don't think\nthey'll touch me. They'll greet me with open arms when I go down there,\nand they'll be eager to talk to me.\"\n\n\"Are you crazy?\" Jack cried, leaping to his feet. \"We can't let you go\nout there.\"\n\n\"Don't worry,\" Dal said. \"I know exactly what I'm doing. I'll be able to\nhandle the situation, believe me.\"\n\nHe hesitated a moment, and gave Fuzzy a last nervous pat, settling him\nmore firmly on his shoulder. Then he started down the corridor for the\nentrance lock.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe had promised himself long before ... many years before ... that he\nwould never do what he planned to do now, but now he knew that there was\nno alternative. The only other choice was to wait helplessly until the\npower failed and the protective screen vanished and the creatures on the\nground outside tore the ship to pieces.\n\nAs he stood in the airlock waiting for the pressure to shift to outside\nnormal, he lifted Fuzzy down into the crook of his arm and rubbed the\nlittle creature between the shoe-button eyes. \"You've got to back me up\nnow,\" he whispered softly. \"It's been a long time, I know that, but I\nneed help now. It's going to be up to you.\"\n\nDal knew the subtle strength of his people's peculiar talent. From the\nmoment he had stepped down to the ground the second time with Tiger and\nJack, even with Fuzzy waiting back on the ship, he had felt the powerful\nwave of horror and fear and anger rising up from the Bruckians, and he\nhad glimpsed the awful idiot vacancy of the minds of the creatures in\nthe enclosure, in whom the intelligent virus was already dead. This had\nrequired no effort; it just came naturally into his mind, and he had\nknown instantly that something terrible had gone wrong.\n\nIn the years on Hospital Earth, he had carefully forced himself never to\nthink in terms of his special talent. He had diligently screened off the\nimpressions and emotions that struck at him constantly from his\nclassmates and from others that he came in contact with. Above all, he\nhad fought down the temptation to turn his power the other way, to use\nit to his own advantage.\n\nBut now, as the lock opened and he started down the ladder, he closed\nhis mind to everything else. Hugging Fuzzy close to his side, he turned\nhis mind into a single tight channel. He drove the thought out at the\nBruckians with all the power he could muster: _I come in peace. I mean\nyou no harm. I have good news, joyful news. You must be happy to see me,\neager to welcome me...._\n\nHe could feel the wave of anger and fear strike him like a physical blow\nas soon as he appeared in the entrance lock. The cries rose up in a\nwave, and the crowd surged in toward the ship. With the energy field\nreleased, there was nothing to stop them; they were tripping over each\nother to reach the bottom of the ladder first, shouting threats and\nwaving angry fists, reaching up to grab at Dal's ankles as he came\ndown....\n\nAnd then as if by magic the cries died in the throats of the ones\nclosest to the ladder. The angry fists unclenched, and extended into\noutstretched hands to help him down to the ground. As though an\never-widening wave was spreading out around him, the aura of peace and\ngood will struck the people in the crowd. And as it spread, the anger\nfaded from the faces; the hard lines gave way to puzzled frowns, then to\nsmiles. Dal channeled his thoughts more rigidly, and watched the effect\nspread out from him like ripples in a pond, as anger and suspicion and\nfear melted away to be replaced by confidence and trust.\n\nDal had seen it occur a thousand times before. He could remember his\ntrips on Garvian trading ships with his father, when the traders with\ntheir fuzzy pink friends on their shoulders faced cold, hostile,\nsuspicious buyers. It had seemed almost miraculous the way the\nsuspicions melted away and the hostile faces became friendly as the\nbuyers' minds became receptive to bargaining and trading. He had even\nseen it happen on the _Teegar_ with Tiger and Jack, and it was no\ncoincidence that throughout the galaxy the Garvians--always accompanied\nby their fuzzy friends--had assumed the position of power and wealth and\nleadership that they had.\n\nAnd now once again the pattern was being repeated. The Bruckians who\nsurrounded Dal were smiling and talking eagerly; they made no move to\ntouch him or harm him.\n\nThe spokesman they had talked to before was there at his elbow, and Dal\nheard himself saying, \"We have found the answer to your problem. We know\nnow the true nature of your race, and the nature of your intelligence.\nYou were afraid that we would find out, but your fears were groundless.\nWe will not turn our knowledge against you. We only want to help you.\"\n\nAn expression almost like despair had crossed the spokesman's face as\nDal spoke. Now he said, \"It would be good--if we could believe you. But\nhow can we? We have been driven for so long and come so far, and now you\nwould seek to wipe us out as parasites and disease-carriers.\"\n\nDal saw the Bruckian creature's eyes upon him, saw the frail body\ntremble and the lips move, but he knew now that the intelligence that\nformed the words and the thoughts behind them, the intelligence that\nmade the lips speak the words, was the intelligence of a creature far\ndifferent from the one he was looking at--a creature formed of billions\nof submicroscopic units, imbedded in every one of the Bruckian's body\ncells, trapped there now and helpless against the antibody reaction that\nsought to destroy them. This was the intelligence that had called for\nhelp in its desperate plight, but had not quite dared to trust its\nrescuers with the whole truth.\n\nBut was this strange virus-creature good or evil, hostile or friendly?\nDal's hand lay on Fuzzy's tiny body, but he felt no quiver, no vibration\nof fear. He looked across the face of the crowd, trying with all his\nstrength to open his mind to the feelings and emotions of these people.\nOften enough, with Fuzzy nearby, he had felt the harsh impact of\nhostile, cruel, brutal minds, even when the owners of those minds had\ntried to conceal their feelings behind smiles and pleasant words. But\nhere there was no sign of the sickening feeling that kind of mind\nproduced, no hint of hostility or evil.\n\nHe shook his head. \"Why should we want to destroy you?\" he said. \"You\nare good, and peaceful. We know that; why should we harm you? All you\nwant is a place to live, and a host to join with you in a mutually\nvaluable partnership. But you did not tell us everything you could about\nyourselves, and as a result we have destroyed some of you in our clumsy\nattempts to learn your true nature.\"\n\nThey talked then, and bit by bit the story came out. The life-form was\nindeed a virus, unimaginably ancient, and intelligent throughout\nmillions of years of its history. Driven by over-population, a pure\nculture of the virus-creatures had long ago departed from their original\nnative hosts, and traveled like encapsulated spores across space from a\ndistant galaxy. The trip had been long and exhausting; the\nvirus-creatures had retained only the minimum strength necessary to\nestablish themselves in a new host, some unintelligent creature living\non an uninhabited planet, a creature that could benefit by the great\nintelligence of the virus-creatures, and provide food and shelter for\nboth. Finally, after thousands of years of searching, they had found\nthis planet with its dull-minded, fruit-gathering inhabitants. These\ncreatures had seemed perfect as hosts, and the virus-creatures had\nthought their long search for a perfect partner was finally at an end.\n\nIt was not until they had expended the last dregs of their energy in\nanchoring themselves into the cells and tissues of their new hosts that\nthey discovered to their horror that the host-creatures could not\ntolerate them. Unlike their original hosts, the bodies of these\ncreatures began developing deadly antibodies that attacked the virus\ninvaders. In their desperate attempts to hold on and fight back, the\nvirus-creatures had destroyed vital centers in the new hosts, and one by\none they had begun to die. There was not enough energy left for the\nvirus-creatures to detach themselves and move on; without some way to\nstem the onslaught of the antibodies, they were doomed to total\ndestruction.\n\n\"We were afraid to tell you doctors the truth,\" the spokesman said. \"As\nwe wandered and searched we discovered that creatures like ourselves\nwere extreme rarities in the universe, that most creatures similar to us\nwere mindless, unintelligent parasites that struck down their hosts and\ndestroyed them. Wherever we went, life-forms of your kind regarded us as\ndisease-bearers, and their doctors taught them ways to destroy us. We\nhad hoped that from you we might find a way to save ourselves--then you\nunleashed on us the one weapon we could not fight.\"\n\n\"But not maliciously,\" Dal said. \"Only because we did not understand.\nAnd now that we do, there may be a way to help. A difficult way, but at\nleast a way. The antibodies themselves can be neutralized, but it may\ntake our biochemists and virologists and all their equipment months or\neven years to develop and synthesize the proper antidote.\"\n\nThe spokesman looked at Dal, and turned away with a hopeless gesture.\n\"Then it is too late, after all,\" he said. \"We are dying too fast. Even\nthose of us who have not been affected so far are beginning to feel the\nearly symptoms of the antibody attack.\" He smiled sadly and reached out\nto stroke the small pink creature on Dal's arm. \"Your people too have a\npartner, I see. We envy you.\"\n\nDal felt a movement on his arm and looked down at Fuzzy. He had always\ntaken his little friend for granted, but now he thought of the feeling\nof emptiness and loss that had come across him when Fuzzy had been\nalmost killed. He had often wondered just what Fuzzy might be like if\nhis almost-fluid, infinitely adaptable physical body had only been\nendowed with intelligence. He had wondered what kind of a creature Fuzzy\nmight be if he were able to use his remarkable structure with the\nguidance of an intelligent mind behind it....\n\nHe felt another movement on his arm, and his eyes widened as he stared\ndown at his little friend.\n\nA moment before, there had been a single three-inch pink creature on his\nelbow. But now there were two, each just one-half the size of the\noriginal. As Dal watched, one of the two drew away from the other,\ncreeping in to snuggle closer to Dal's side, and a pair of shoe-button\neyes appeared and blinked up at him trustingly. But the other creature\nwas moving down his arm, straining out toward the Bruckian spokesman....\n\nDal realized instantly what was happening. He started to draw back, but\nsomething stopped him. Deep in his mind he could sense a gentle voice\nreassuring him, saying, _It's all right, there is nothing to fear, no\nharm will come to me. These creatures need help, and this is the way to\nhelp them._\n\nHe saw the Bruckian reach out a trembling hand. The tiny pink creature\nthat had separated from Fuzzy seemed almost to leap across to the\noutstretched hand. And then the spokesman held him close, and the new\nFuzzy shivered happily.\n\nThe virus-creatures had found a host. Here was the ideal kind of body\nfor their intelligence to work with and mold, a host where\nantibody-formation could be perfectly controlled. Dal knew now that the\nproblem had almost been solved once before, when the virus-creature had\nreached Fuzzy on the ship; if they had only waited a little longer they\nwould have seen Fuzzy recover from his illness a different creature\nentirely than before.\n\nAlready the new creature was dividing again, with half going on to the\nnext of the Bruckians. To a submicroscopic virus, the body of the host\nwould not have to be large; soon there would be a sufficient number of\nhosts to serve the virus-creatures' needs forever. As he started back up\nthe ladder to the ship, Dal knew that the problem on 31 Brucker VII had\nfound a happy and permanent solution.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBack in the control room Dal related what had happened from beginning to\nend. There was only one detail that he concealed. He could not bring\nhimself to tell Tiger and Jack of the true nature of his relationship\nwith Fuzzy, of the odd power over the emotions of others that Fuzzy's\npresence gave him. He could tell by their faces that they realized that\nhe was leaving something out; they had watched him go down to face a\nblood-thirsty mob, and had seen that mob become docile as lambs as\nthough by magic. Clearly they could not understand what had happened,\nyet they did not ask him.\n\n\"So it was Fuzzy's idea to volunteer as a new host for the creatures,\"\nJack said.\n\nDal nodded. \"I knew that he could reproduce, of course,\" he said. \"Every\nGarvian has a Fuzzy, and whenever a new Garvian is born, the father's\nFuzzy always splits so that half can join the new-born child. It's like\nthe division of a cell; within hours the Fuzzy that stayed down there\nwill have divided to provide enough protoplasm for every one of the\nsurviving intelligent Bruckians.\"\n\n\"And your diagnosis was the right one,\" Jack said.\n\n\"We'll see,\" Dal said. \"Tomorrow we'll know better.\"\n\nBut clearly the problem had been solved. The next day there was an\nexcited conference between the spokesman and the doctors on the\n_Lancet_. The Bruckians had elected to maintain the same host body as\nbefore. They had gotten used to it; with the small pink creatures\nserving as a shelter to protect them against the deadly antibodies, they\ncould live in peace and security. But they were eager, before the\n_Lancet_ disembarked, to sign a full medical service contract with the\ndoctors from Hospital Earth. A contract was signed, subject only to\nfinal acceptance and ratification by the Hospital Earth officials.\n\nNow that their radio was free again, the three doctors jubilantly\nprepared a full account of the problem of 31 Brucker and its solution,\nand dispatched the news of the new contract to the first relay station\non its way back to Hospital Earth. Then, weary to the point of collapse,\nthey retired for the first good sleep in days, eagerly awaiting an\nofficial response from Hospital Earth on the completed case and the\ncontract.\n\n\"It ought to wipe out any black mark Dr. Tanner has against any of us,\"\nJack said happily. \"And especially in Dal's case.\" He grinned at the Red\nDoctor. \"This one has been yours, all the way. You pulled it out of the\nfire after I flubbed it completely, and you're going to get the credit,\nif I have anything to say about it.\"\n\n\"We should all get credit,\" Dal said. \"A new contract isn't signed every\nday of the year. But the way we all fumbled our way into it, Hospital\nEarth shouldn't pay much attention to it anyway.\"\n\nBut Dal knew that he was only throwing up his habitual shield to guard\nagainst disappointment. Traditionally, a new contract meant a Star\nrating for each of the crew that brought it in. All through medical\nschool Dal had read the reports of other patrol ships that had secured\nnew contracts with uncontacted planets, and he had seen the fanfare and\nhonor that were heaped on the doctors from those ships. And for the\nfirst time since he had entered medical school years before, Dal now\nallowed himself to hope that his goal was in sight.\n\nHe wanted to be a Star Surgeon more than anything else. It was the one\nthing that he had wanted and worked for since the cruel days when the\nplague had swept his homeland, destroying his mother and leaving his\nfather an ailing cripple. And since his assignment aboard the _Lancet_,\none thought had filled his mind: to turn in the scarlet collar and cuff\nin return for the cape and silver star of the full-fledged physician in\nthe Red Service of Surgery.\n\nAlways before there had been the half-conscious dread that something\nwould happen, that in the end, after all the work, the silver star would\nstill remain just out of reach, that somehow he would never quite get\nit.\n\nBut now there could be no question. Even Black Doctor Tanner could not\ndeny a new contract. The crew of the _Lancet_ would be called back to\nHospital Earth for a full report on the newly contacted race, and their\ndays as probationary doctors in the General Practice patrol would be\nover.\n\nAfter they had slept themselves out, the doctors prepared the ship for\nlaunching, and made their farewells to the Bruckian spokesman.\n\n\"When the contract is ratified,\" Jack said, \"a survey ship will come\nhere. They will have all of the information that we have gathered, and\nthey will spend many months gathering more. Tell them everything they\nwant to know. Don't conceal anything, because once they have completed\ntheir survey, any General Practice Patrol ship in the galaxy will be\nable to answer a call for help and have the information they need to\nserve you.\"\n\nThey delayed launching hour by hour waiting for a response from Hospital\nEarth, but the radio was silent. They thought of a dozen reasons why the\nmessage might have been delayed, but the radio silence continued.\nFinally they strapped down and lifted the ship from the planet, still\nwaiting for a response.\n\nWhen it finally came, there was no message of congratulations, nor even\nany acknowledgment of the new contract. Instead, there was only a terse\nmessage:\n\n      PROCEED TO REFERENCE POINT 43621 SECTION XIX AND STAND BY\n      FOR INSPECTION PARTY\n\nTiger took the message and read it in silence, then handed it to Dal.\n\n\"What do they say?\" Jack said.\n\n\"Read it,\" Dal said. \"They don't mention the contract, just an\ninspection party.\"\n\n\"Inspection party! Is that the best they can do for us?\"\n\n\"They don't sound too enthusiastic,\" Tiger said. \"At least you'd think\nthey could acknowledge receipt of our report.\"\n\n\"It's probably just part of the routine,\" Dal said. \"Maybe they want to\nconfirm our reports from our own records before they commit themselves.\"\n\nBut he knew that he was only whistling in the dark. The moment he saw\nthe terse message, he knew something had gone wrong with the contract.\nThere would be no notes of congratulation, no returning in triumph and\nhonor to Hospital Earth.\n\nWhatever the reason for the inspection party, Dal felt certain who the\ninspector was going to be.\n\nIt had been exciting to dream, but the scarlet cape and the silver star\nwere still a long way out of reach.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12\n\nTHE SHOWDOWN\n\n\nIt was hours later when their ship reached the contact point\nco-ordinates. There had been little talk during the transit; each of\nthem knew already what the other was thinking, and there wasn't much to\nbe said. The message had said it for them.\n\nDal's worst fears were realized when the inspection ship appeared,\nconverting from Koenig drive within a few miles of the _Lancet_. He had\nseen the ship before--a sleek, handsomely outfitted patrol class ship\nwith the insignia of the Black Service of Pathology emblazoned on its\nhull, the private ship of a Four-star Black Doctor.\n\nBut none of them anticipated the action taken by the inspection ship as\nit drew within lifeboat range of the _Lancet_.\n\nA scooter shot away from its storage rack on the black ship, and a crew\nof black-garbed technicians piled into the _Lancet_'s entrance lock,\ndressed in the special decontamination suits worn when a ship was\nreturning from a plague spot into uninfected territory.\n\n\"What is this?\" Tiger demanded as the technicians started unloading\ndecontamination gear into the lock. \"What are you doing with that\nstuff?\"\n\nThe squad leader looked at him sourly. \"You're in quarantine, Doc,\" he\nsaid. \"Class I, all precautions, contact with unidentified pestilence.\nIf you don't like it, argue with the Black Doctor, I've just got a job\nto do.\"\n\nHe started shouting orders to his men, and they scattered throughout the\nship, with blowers and disinfectants, driving antiseptic sprays into\nevery crack and cranny of the ship's interior, scouring the hull outside\nin the rigid pattern prescribed for plague ships. They herded the\ndoctors into the decontamination lock, stripped them of their clothes,\nscrubbed them down and tossed them special sterilized fatigues to wear\nwith masks and gloves.\n\n\"This is idiotic,\" Jack protested. \"We aren't carrying any dangerous\norganisms!\"\n\nThe squad leader shrugged indifferently. \"Tell it to the Black Doctor,\nnot me. All I know is that this ship is under quarantine until it's\nofficially released, and from what I hear, it's not going to be released\nfor quite some time.\"\n\nAt last the job was done, and the scooter departed back to the\ninspection ship. A few moments later they saw it returning, this time\ncarrying just three men. In addition to the pilot and one technician,\nthere was a single passenger: a portly figure dressed in a black robe,\nhorn-rimmed glasses and cowl.\n\nThe scooter grappled the _Lancet_'s side, and Black Doctor Hugo Tanner\nclimbed wheezing into the entrance lock, followed by the technician. He\nstopped halfway into the lock to get his breath, and paused again as the\nlock swung closed behind him. Dal was shocked at the physical change in\nthe man in the few short weeks since he had seen him last. The Black\nDoctor's face was gray; every effort of movement brought on paroxysms of\ncoughing. He looked sick, and he looked tired, yet his jaw was still set\nin angry determination.\n\nThe doctors stood at attention as he stepped into the control room,\nhardly able to conceal their surprise at seeing him. \"Well?\" the Black\nDoctor snapped at them. \"What's the trouble with you? You act like\nyou've seen a ghost or something.\"\n\n\"We--we'd heard that you were in the hospital, sir.\"\n\n\"Did you, now!\" the Black Doctor snorted. \"Hospital! Bah! I had to tell\nthe press something to get the hounds off me for a while. These young\npuppies seem to think that a Black Doctor can just walk away from his\nduties any time he chooses to undergo their fancy surgical procedures.\nAnd you know who's been screaming the loudest to get their hands on me.\nThe Red Service of Surgery, that's who!\"\n\nThe Black Doctor glared at Dal Timgar. \"Well, I dare say the Red Doctors\nwill have their chance at me, all in good time. But first there are\ncertain things which must be taken care of.\" He looked up at the\nattendant. \"You're quite certain that the ship has been decontaminated?\"\n\nThe attendant nodded. \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"And the crewmen?\"\n\n\"It's safe to talk to them, sir, as long as you avoid physical contact.\"\n\nThe Black Doctor grunted and wheezed and settled himself down in a seat.\n\"All right now, gentlemen,\" he said to the three, \"let's have your story\nof this affair in the Brucker system, right from the start.\"\n\n\"But we sent in a full report,\" Tiger said.\n\n\"I'm aware of that, you idiot. I have waded through your report, all\nthirty-five pages of it, and I only wish you hadn't been so\nlong-winded. Now I want to hear what happened directly from you. Well?\"\n\nThe three doctors looked at each other. Then Jack began the story,\nstarting with the first hesitant \"greeting\" that had come through to\nthem. He told everything that had happened without embellishments: their\nfirst analysis of the nature of the problem, the biochemical and medical\nsurvey that they ran on the afflicted people, his own failure to make\nthe diagnosis, the incident of Fuzzy's sudden affliction, and the\nstrange solution that had finally come from it. As he talked the Black\nDoctor sat back with his eyes half closed, his face blank, listening and\nnodding from time to time as the story proceeded.\n\nAnd Jack was carefully honest and fair in his account. \"We were all of\nus lost, until Dal Timgar saw the significance of what had happened to\nFuzzy,\" he said. \"His idea of putting the creature through the filter\ngave us our first specimen of the isolated virus, and showed us how to\nobtain the antibody. Then after we saw what happened with our initial\nseries of injections, we were really at sea, and by then we couldn't\nreach a hospital ship for help of any kind.\" He went on to relate Dal's\nidea that the virus itself might be the intelligent creature, and\nrecounted the things that happened after Dal went down to talk to the\nspokesman again with Fuzzy on his shoulder.\n\nThrough it all the Black Doctor listened sourly, glancing occasionally\nat Dal and saying nothing. \"So is that all?\" he said when Jack had\nfinished.\n\n\"Not quite,\" Jack said. \"I want it to be on the record that it was my\nfailure in diagnosis that got us into trouble. I don't want any\nmisunderstanding about that. If I'd had the wit to think beyond the end\nof my nose, there wouldn't have been any problem.\"\n\n\"I see,\" the Black Doctor said. He pointed to Dal. \"So it was this one\nwho really came up with the answers and directed the whole program on\nthis problem, is that right?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Jack said firmly. \"He should get all the credit.\"\n\nSomething stirred in Dal's mind and he felt Fuzzy snuggling in tightly\nto his side. He could feel the cold hostility in the Black Doctor's\nmind, and he started to say something, but the Black Doctor cut him off.\n\"Do you agree to that also, Dr. Martin?\" he asked Tiger.\n\n\"I certainly do,\" Tiger said. \"I'll back up the Blue Doctor right down\nthe line.\"\n\nThe Black Doctor smiled unpleasantly and nodded. \"Well, I'm certainly\nhappy to hear you say that, gentlemen. I might say that it is a very\ngreat relief to me to hear it from your own testimony. Because this time\nthere shouldn't be any argument from either of you as to just where the\nresponsibility lies, and I'm relieved to know that I can completely\nexonerate you two, at any rate.\"\n\nJack Alvarez's jaw went slack and he stared at the Black Doctor as\nthough he hadn't heard him properly. \"Exonerate us?\" he said. \"Exonerate\nus from what?\"\n\n\"From the charges of incompetence, malpractice and conduct unbecoming to\na physician which I am lodging against your colleague in the Red Service\nhere,\" the Black Doctor said angrily. \"Of course, I was confident that\nneither of you two could have contributed very much to this bungling\nmess, but it is reassuring to have your own statements of that fact on\nthe record. They should carry more weight in a Council hearing than any\nplea I might make in your behalf.\"\n\n\"But--but what do you mean by a Council hearing?\" Tiger stammered. \"I\ndon't understand you! This--this problem is _solved_. We solved it as a\npatrol team, all of us. We sent in a brand new medical service contract\nfrom those people....\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. _That!_\" The Black Doctor drew a long pink dispatch sheet from\nan inner pocket and opened it out. The doctors could see the photo\nreproductions of their signatures at the bottom. \"Fortunately--for you\ntwo--this bit of nonsense was brought to my attention at the first relay\nstation that received it. I personally accepted it and withdrew it from\nthe circuit before it could reach Hospital Earth for filing.\"\n\nSlowly, as they watched him, he ripped the pink dispatch sheet into a\ndozen pieces and tossed it into the disposal vent. \"So much for that,\"\nhe said slowly. \"I can choose to overlook your foolishness in trying to\ncloud the important issues with a so-called 'contract' to divert\nattention, but I'm afraid I can't pay much attention to it, nor allow it\nto appear in the general report. And of course I am forced to classify\nthe _Lancet_ as a plague ship until a bacteriological and virological\nexamination has been completed on both ship and crew. The planet itself\nwill be considered a galactic plague spot until proper measures have\nbeen taken to insure its decontamination.\"\n\nThe Black Doctor drew some papers from another pocket and turned to Dal\nTimgar. \"As for you, the charges are clear enough. You have broken the\nmost fundamental rules of good judgment and good medicine in handling\nthe 31 Brucker affair. You have permitted a General Practice Patrol ship\nto approach a potentially dangerous plague spot without any notification\nof higher authorities. You have undertaken a biochemical and medical\nsurvey for which you had neither the proper equipment nor the training\nqualifications, and you exposed your ship and your crewmates to an\nincredible risk in landing on such a planet. You are responsible for\nuntold--possibly fatal--damage to over two hundred individuals of the\nrace that called on you for help. You have even subjected the creature\nthat depends upon your own race for its life and support to virtual\nslavery and possible destruction; and finally, you had the audacity to\ntry to cover up your bungling with claims of arranging a medical service\ncontract with an uninvestigated race.\"\n\nThe Black Doctor broke off as an attendant came in the door and\nwhispered something in his ear. Doctor Tanner shook his head angrily, \"I\ncan't be bothered now!\"\n\n\"They say it's urgent, sir.\"\n\n\"Yes, it's always urgent.\" The Black Doctor heaved to his feet. \"If it\nweren't for this miserable incompetent here, I wouldn't have to be\ntaking precious time away from my more important duties.\" He scowled at\nthe _Lancet_ crewmen. \"You will excuse me for a moment,\" he said, and\ndisappeared into the communications room.\n\nThe moment he was gone from the room, Jack and Tiger were talking at\nonce. \"He couldn't really be serious,\" Tiger said. \"It's impossible! Not\none of those charges would hold up under investigation.\"\n\n\"Well, I think it's a frame-up,\" Jack said, his voice tight with anger.\n\"I knew that some people on Hospital Earth were out to get you, but I\ndon't see how a Four-star Black Doctor could be a party to such a thing.\nEither someone has been misinforming him, or he just doesn't understand\nwhat happened.\"\n\nDal shook his head. \"He understands, all right, and he's the one who's\ndetermined to get me out of medicine. This is a flimsy excuse, but he\nhas to use it, because it's now or never. He knows that if we bring in a\ncontract with a new planet, and it's formally ratified, we'll all get\nour Stars and he'd never be able to block me again. And Black Doctor\nTanner is going to be certain that I don't get that Star, or die\ntrying.\"\n\n\"But this is completely unfair,\" Jack protested. \"He's turning our own\nwords against you! You can bet that he'll have a survey crew down on\nthat planet in no time, bringing home a contract just the same as the\none we wrote, and there won't be any questions asked about it.\"\n\n\"Except that I'll be out of the service,\" Dal said. \"Don't worry. You'll\nget the credit in the long run. When all the dust settles, he'll be sure\nthat you two are named as agents for the contract. He doesn't want to\nhurt you, it's me that he's out to get.\"\n\n\"Well, he won't get away with it,\" Tiger said. \"We can see to that. It's\nnot too late to retract our stories. If he thinks he can get rid of you\nwith something that wasn't your fault, he's going to find out that he\nhas to get rid of a lot more than just you.\"\n\nBut Dal was shaking his head. \"Not this time, Tiger. This time you keep\nout of it.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, keep out of it?\" Tiger cried. \"Do you think I'm going\nto stand by quietly and watch him cut you down?\"\n\n\"That's exactly what you're going to do,\" Dal said sharply. \"I meant\nwhat I said. I want you to keep your mouth shut. Don't say anything more\nat all, just let it be.\"\n\n\"But I can't stand by and do nothing! When a friend of mine needs\nhelp--\"\n\n\"Can't you get it through your thick skull that this time I don't want\nyour help?\" Dal said. \"Do me a favor this time. _Leave me alone._ Don't\nstick your thumb in the pie.\"\n\nTiger just stared at the little Garvian. \"Look, Dal, all I'm trying to\ndo--\"\n\n\"I know what you're trying to do,\" Dal snapped, \"and I don't want any\npart of it. I don't need your help, I don't _want_ it. Why do you have\nto force it down my throat?\"\n\nThere was a long silence. Then Tiger spread his hands helplessly.\n\"Okay,\" he said, \"if that's the way you want it.\" He turned away from\nDal, his big shoulders slumping. \"I've only been trying to make up for\nsome of the dirty breaks you've been handed since you came to Hospital\nEarth.\"\n\n\"I know that,\" Dal said, \"and I've appreciated it. Sometimes it's been\nthe only thing that's kept me going. But that doesn't mean that you own\nme. Friendship is one thing; proprietorship is something else. I'm not\nyour private property.\"\n\nHe saw the look on Tiger's face, as though he had suddenly turned and\nslapped him viciously across the face. \"Look, I know it sounds awful,\nbut I can't help it. I don't want to hurt you, and I don't want to\nchange things with us, but _I'm a person just like you are_. I can't go\non leaning on you any longer. Everybody has to stand on his own\nsomewhere along the line. You do, and I do, too. And that goes for Jack,\ntoo.\"\n\nThey heard the door to the communications shack open, and the Black\nDoctor was back in the room. \"Well?\" he said. \"Am I interrupting\nsomething?\" He glanced sharply at the tight-lipped doctors. \"The call\nwas from the survey section,\" he went on blandly. \"A survey crew is on\nits way to 31 Brucker to start gathering some useful information on the\nsituation. But that is neither here nor there. You have heard the\ncharges against the Red Doctor here. Is there anything any of you want\nto say?\"\n\nTiger and Jack looked at each other. The silence in the room was\nprofound.\n\nThe Black Doctor turned to Dal. \"And what about you?\"\n\n\"I have something to say, but I'd like to talk to you alone.\"\n\n\"As you wish. You two will return to your quarters and stay there.\"\n\n\"The attendant, too,\" Dal said.\n\nThe Black Doctor's eyes glinted and met Dal's for a moment. Then he\nshrugged and nodded to his attendant. \"Step outside, please. We have a\nprivate matter to discuss.\"\n\nThe Black Doctor turned his attention to the papers on the desk as Dal\nstood before him with Fuzzy sitting in the crook of his arm. From the\nmoment that the notice of the inspection ship's approach had come to the\n_Lancet_, Dal had known what was coming. He had been certain what the\npurpose of the detainment was, and who the inspector would be, yet he\nhad not really been worried. In the back of his mind, a small,\ncomfortable thought had been sustaining him.\n\nIt didn't really matter how hostile or angry Black Doctor Tanner might\nbe; he knew that in a last-ditch stand there was one way the Black\nDoctor could be handled.\n\nHe remembered the dramatic shift from hostility to friendliness among\nthe Bruckians when he had come down from the ship with Fuzzy on his\nshoulder. Before then, he had never considered using his curious power\nto protect himself and gain an end; but since then, without even\nconsciously bringing it to mind, he had known that the next time would\nbe easier. If it ever came to a showdown with Black Doctor Tanner, a\ntrap from which he couldn't free himself, there was still this way. _The\nBlack Doctor would never know what happened_, he thought. _It would just\nseem to him, suddenly, that he had been looking at things the wrong way.\nNo one would ever know._\n\nBut he knew, even as the thought came to mind, that this was not so.\nNow, face to face with the showdown, he knew that it was no good. One\nperson would know what had happened: himself. On 31 Brucker, he had\nconvinced himself that the end justified the means; here it was\ndifferent.\n\nFor a moment, as Black Doctor Tanner stared up at him through the\nhorn-rimmed glasses, Dal wavered. Why should he hesitate to protect\nhimself? he thought angrily. This attack against him was false and\nunfair, trumped up for the sole purpose of destroying his hopes and\ndriving him out of the Service. Why shouldn't he grasp at any means,\nfair or unfair, to fight it?\n\nBut he could hear the echo of Black Doctor Arnquist's words in his mind:\n_I beg of you not to use it. No matter what happens, don't use it._ Of\ncourse, Doctor Arnquist would never know, for sure, that he had broken\nfaith ... but _he_ would know....\n\n\"Well,\" Black Doctor Tanner was saying, \"speak up. I can't waste much\nmore time dealing with you. If you have something to say, say it.\"\n\nDal sighed. He lifted Fuzzy down and slipped him gently into his jacket\npocket. \"These charges against me are not true,\" he said.\n\nThe Black Doctor shrugged. \"Your own crewmates support them with their\nstatements.\"\n\n\"That's not the point. They're not true, and you know it as well as I\ndo. You've deliberately rigged them up to build a case against me.\"\n\nThe Black Doctor's face turned dark and his hands clenched on the papers\non the desk. \"Are you suggesting that I have nothing better to do than\nto rig false charges against one probationer out of seventy-five\nthousand traveling the galaxy?\"\n\n\"I'm suggesting that we are alone here,\" Dal said. \"Nobody else is\nlistening. Just for once, right now, we can be honest. We both know\nwhat you're trying to do to me. I'd just like to hear you admit it\nonce.\"\n\nThe Black Doctor slammed his fist down on the table. \"I don't have to\nlisten to insolence like this,\" he roared.\n\n\"Yes, you do,\" Dal said. \"Just this once. Then I'll be through.\"\nSuddenly Dal's words were tumbling out of control, and his whole body\nwas trembling with anger. \"You have been determined from the very\nbeginning that I should never finish the medical training that I\nstarted. You've tried to block me time after time, in every way you\ncould think of. You've almost succeeded, but never quite made it until\nthis time. But now you _have_ to make it. If that contract were to go\nthrough I'd get my Star, and you'd never again be able to do anything\nabout it. So it's now or never if you're going to break me.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" the Black Doctor stormed. \"I wouldn't lower myself to meddle\nwith your kind. The charges speak for themselves.\"\n\n\"Not if you look at them carefully. You claim I failed to notify\nHospital Earth that we had entered a plague area--but our records of our\ncontact with the planet prove that we did only what any patrol ship\nwould have done when the call came in. We didn't have enough information\nto know that there was a plague there, and when we finally did know the\ntruth we could no longer make contact with Hospital Earth. You claim\nthat I brought harm to two hundred of the natives there, yet if you\nstudy our notes and records, you will see that our errors there were\nunavoidable. We couldn't have done anything else under the\ncircumstances, and if we hadn't done what we did, we would have been\nignoring the basic principles of diagnosis and treatment which we've\nbeen taught. And your charges don't mention that by possibly harming two\nhundred of the Bruckians, we found a way to save two million of them\nfrom absolute destruction.\"\n\nThe Black Doctor glared at him. \"The charges will stand up, I'll see to\nthat.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm sure you will! You can ram them through and make them stick\nbefore anybody ever has a chance to examine them carefully. You have the\npower to do it. And by the time an impartial judge could review all the\nrecords, your survey ship will have been there and gathered so much more\ndata and muddied up the field so thoroughly that no one will ever be\ncertain that the charges aren't true. But you and I know that they\nwouldn't really hold up under inspection. We know that they're false\nright down the line and that you're the one who is responsible for\nthem.\"\n\nThe Black Doctor grew darker, and he trembled with rage as he drew\nhimself to his feet. Dal could feel his hatred almost like a physical\nblow and his voice was almost a shriek.\n\n\"All right,\" he said, \"if you insist, then the charges are lies, made up\nspecifically to break you, and I'm going to push them through if I have\nto jeopardize my reputation to do it. You could have bowed out\ngracefully at any time along the way and saved yourself dishonor and\ndisgrace, but you wouldn't do it. Now, I'm going to force you to. I've\nworked my lifetime long to build the reputation of Hospital Earth and of\nthe Earthmen that go out to all the planets as representatives. I've\nworked to make the Confederation respect Hospital Earth and the Earthmen\nwho are her doctors. You don't belong here with us. You forced yourself\nin, you aren't an Earthman and you don't have the means or resources to\nbe a doctor from Hospital Earth. If you succeed, a thousand others will\nfollow in your footsteps, chipping away at the reputation that we have\nworked to build, and I'm not going to allow one incompetent alien\nbungler pretending to be a surgeon to walk in and destroy the thing I've\nfought to build--\"\n\nThe Black Doctor's voice had grown shrill, almost out of control. But\nnow suddenly he broke off, his mouth still working, and his face went\ndeathly white. The finger he was pointing at Dal wavered and fell. He\nclutched at his chest, his breath coming in great gasps and staggered\nback into the chair. \"Something's happened,\" his voice croaked. \"I can't\nbreathe.\"\n\nDal stared at him in horror for a moment, then leaped across the room\nand jammed his thumb against the alarm bell.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13\n\nTHE TRIAL\n\n\nRed Doctor Dal Timgar knew at once that there would be no problem in\ndiagnosis here. The Black Doctor slumped back in his seat, gasping for\nair, his face twisted in pain as he labored just to keep on breathing.\nTiger and Jack burst into the room, and Dal could tell that they knew\ninstantly what had happened.\n\n\"Coronary,\" Jack said grimly.\n\nDal nodded. \"The question is, just how bad.\"\n\n\"Get the cardiograph in here. We'll soon see.\"\n\nBut the electrocardiograph was not needed to diagnose the nature of the\ntrouble. All three doctors had seen the picture often enough--the\nsudden, massive blockage of circulation to the heart that was so common\nto creatures with central circulatory pumps, the sort of catastrophic\naccident which could cause irreparable crippling or sudden death within\na matter of minutes.\n\nTiger injected some medicine to ease the pain, and started oxygen to\nhelp the labored breathing, but the old man's color did not improve. He\nwas too weak to talk; he just lay helplessly gasping for air as they\nlifted him up onto a bed. Then Jack took an electrocardiograph tracing\nand shook his head.\n\n\"We'd better get word back to Hospital Earth, and fast,\" he said\nquietly. \"He just waited a little too long for that cardiac transplant,\nthat's all. This is a bad one. Tell them we need a surgeon out here just\nas fast as they can move, or the Black Service is going to have a dead\nphysician on its hands.\"\n\nThere was a sound across the room, and the Black Doctor motioned feebly\nto Tiger. \"The cardiogram,\" he gasped. \"Let me see it.\"\n\n\"There's nothing for you to see,\" Tiger said. \"You mustn't do anything\nto excite yourself.\"\n\n\"Let me see it.\" Dr. Tanner took the thin strip of paper and ran it\nquickly through his fingers. Then he dropped it on the bed and lay his\nhead back hopelessly. \"Too late,\" he said, so softly they could hardly\nhear him. \"Too late for help now.\"\n\nTiger checked his blood pressure and listened to his heart. \"It will\nonly take a few hours to get help,\" he said. \"You rest and sleep now.\nThere's plenty of time.\"\n\nHe joined Dal and Jack in the corridor. \"I'm afraid he's right, this\ntime,\" he said. \"The damage is severe, and he hasn't the strength to\nhold out very long. He might last long enough for a surgeon and\noperating team to get here, but I doubt it. We'd better get the word\noff.\"\n\nA few moments later he put the earphones aside. \"It'll take six hours\nfor the nearest help to get here,\" he said. \"Maybe five and a half if\nthey really crowd it. But when they get a look at that cardiogram on the\nscreen they'll just throw up their hands. He's got to have a transplant,\nnothing less, and even if we can keep him alive until a surgical team\ngets here the odds are a thousand to one against his surviving the\nsurgery.\"\n\n\"Well, he's been asking for it,\" Jack said. \"They've been trying to get\nhim into the hospital for a cardiac transplant for years. Everybody's\nknown that one of those towering rages would get him sooner or later.\"\n\n\"Maybe he'll hold on better than we think,\" Dal said. \"Let's watch and\nwait.\"\n\nBut the Black Doctor was not doing well. Moment by moment he grew\nweaker, laboring harder for air as his blood pressure crept slowly down.\nHalf an hour later the pain returned; Tiger took another tracing while\nDal checked his venous pressure and shock level.\n\nAs he finished, Dal felt the Black Doctor's eyes on him. \"It's going to\nbe all right,\" he said. \"There'll be time for help to come.\"\n\nFeebly the Black Doctor shook his head. \"No time,\" he said. \"Can't wait\nthat long.\" Dal could see the fear in the old man's eyes. His lips began\nto move again as though there were something more he wanted to say; but\nthen his face hardened, and he turned his head away helplessly.\n\nDal walked around the bed and looked down at the tracing, comparing it\nwith the first one that was taken. \"What do you think, Tiger?\"\n\n\"It's no good. He'll never make it for five more hours.\"\n\n\"What about right now?\"\n\nTiger shook his head. \"It's a terrible surgical risk.\"\n\n\"But every minute of waiting makes it worse, right?\"\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\n\"Then I think we'll stop waiting,\" Dal said. \"We have a prosthetic heart\nin condition for use, don't we?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"Good. Get it ready now.\" It seemed as though someone else were\ntalking. \"You'll have to be first assistant, Tiger. We'll get him onto\nthe heart-lung machine, and if we don't have help available by then,\nwe'll have to try to complete the transplant. Jack, you'll give\nanaesthesia, and it will be a tricky job. Try to use local blocks as\nmuch as you can, and have the heart-lung machine ready well in advance.\nWe'll only have a few seconds to make the shift. Now let's get moving.\"\n\nTiger stared at him. \"Are you sure that you want to do this?\"\n\n\"I never wanted anything less in my life,\" Dal said fervently. \"But do\nyou think he can survive until a Hospital Ship arrives?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then it seems to me that I don't have any choice. You two don't need to\nworry. This is a surgical problem now, and I'll take full\nresponsibility.\"\n\nThe Black Doctor was watching him, and Dal knew he had heard the\nconversation. Now the old man lay helplessly as they moved about getting\nthe surgical room into preparation. Jack prepared the anaesthetics,\nchecked and rechecked the complex heart-lung machine which could\nartificially support circulation and respiration at the time that the\ndamaged heart was separated from its great vessels. The transplant\nprosthetic heart had been grown in the laboratories on Hospital Earth\nfrom embryonic tissue; Tiger removed it from the frozen specimen locker\nand brought it to normal body temperature in the special warm saline\nbath designed for the purpose.\n\nThroughout the preparations the Black Doctor lay watching, still\nconscious enough to recognize what was going on, attempting from time to\ntime to shake his head in protest but not quite succeeding. Finally Dal\ncame to the bedside. \"Don't be afraid,\" he said gently to the old man.\n\"It isn't safe to try to delay until the ship from Hospital Earth can\nget here. Every minute we wait is counting against you. I think I can\nmanage the transplant if I start now. I know you don't like it, but I am\nthe Red Doctor in authority on this ship. If I have to order you, I\nwill.\"\n\nThe Black Doctor lay silent for a moment, staring at Dal. Then the fear\nseemed to fade from his face, and the anger disappeared. With a great\neffort he moved his head to nod. \"All right, son,\" he said softly. \"Do\nthe best you know how.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDal knew from the moment he made the decision to go ahead that the thing\nhe was undertaking was all but hopeless.\n\nThere was little or no talk as the three doctors worked at the operating\ntable. The overhead light in the ship's tiny surgery glowed brightly;\nthe only sound in the room was the wheeze of the anaesthesia apparatus,\nthe snap of clamps and the doctors' own quiet breathing as they worked\ndesperately against time.\n\nDal felt as if he were in a dream, working like an automaton, going\nthrough mechanical motions that seemed completely unrelated to the\nliving patient that lay on the operating table. In his training he had\nassisted at hundreds of organ transplant operations; he himself had done\ndozens of cardiac transplants, with experienced surgeons assisting and\nguiding him until the steps of the procedure had become almost second\nnature. On Hospital Earth, with the unparalleled medical facilities\navailable there, and with well-trained teams of doctors, anaesthetists\nand nurses the technique of replacing an old worn-out damaged heart with\na new and healthy one had become commonplace. It posed no more threat to\na patient than a simple appendectomy had posed three centuries before.\n\nBut here in the patrol ship's operating room under emergency conditions\nthere seemed little hope of success. Already the Black Doctor had\nsuffered violent shock from the damage that had occurred in his heart.\nAlready he was clinging to life by a fragile thread; the additional\nshock of the surgery, of the anaesthesia and the necessary conversion to\nthe heart-lung machine while the delicate tissues of the new heart were\nfitted and sutured into place vessel by vessel was more than any patient\ncould be expected to survive.\n\nYet Dal had known when he saw the second cardiogram that the attempt\nwould have to be made. Now he worked swiftly, his frail body engulfed in\nthe voluminous surgical gown, his thin fingers working carefully with\nthe polished instruments. Speed and skill were all that could save the\nBlack Doctor now, to offer him the one chance in a thousand that he had\nfor survival.\n\nBut the speed and skill had to be Dal's. Dal knew that, and the\nknowledge was like a lead weight strapped to his shoulders. If Black\nDoctor Hugo Tanner was fighting for his life now, Dal knew that he too\nwas fighting for his life--the only kind of life that he wanted, the\nlife of a physician.\n\nBlack Doctor Tanner's antagonism to him as an alien, as an incompetent,\nas one who was unworthy to wear the collar and cuff of a physician from\nHospital Earth, was common knowledge. Dal realized with perfect clarity\nthat if he failed now, his career as a physician would be over; no one,\nnot even himself, would ever be entirely certain that he had not\nsomehow, in some dim corner of his mind, allowed himself to fail.\n\nYet if he had not made the attempt and the Black Doctor had died before\nhelp had come, there would always be those who would accuse him of\ndelaying on purpose.\n\nHis mouth was dry; he longed for a drink of water, even though he knew\nthat no water could quench this kind of thirst. His fingers grew numb as\nhe worked, and moment by moment the sense of utter hopelessness grew\nstronger in his mind. Tiger worked stolidly across the table from him,\ninexpert help at best because of the sketchy surgical training he had\nhad. Even his solid presence in support here did not lighten the burden\nfor Dal. There was nothing that Tiger could do or say that would help\nthings or change things now. Even Fuzzy, waiting alone on his perch in\nthe control room, could not help him now. Nothing could help now but his\nown individual skill as a surgeon, and his bitter determination that he\nmust not and would not fail.\n\nBut his fingers faltered as a thousand questions welled up in his mind.\nWas he doing this right? This vessel here ... clamp it and tie it? Or\ndissect it out and try to preserve it? This nerve plexus ... which one\nwas it? How important? How were the blood pressure and respirations\ndoing? Was the Black Doctor holding his own under the assault of the\nsurgery?\n\nThe more Dal tried to hurry the more he seemed to be wading through\nwaist-deep mud, unable to make his fingers do what he wanted them to do.\nHow could he save ten seconds, twenty seconds, a half a minute? That\nhalf a minute might make the difference between success or failure, yet\nthe seconds ticked by swiftly and the procedure was going slowly.\n\nToo slowly. He reached a point where he thought he could not go on. His\nmind was searching desperately for help--any kind of help, something to\nlean on, something to brace him and give him support. And then quite\nsuddenly he understood something clearly that had been nibbling at the\ncorners of his mind for a long time. It was as if someone had snapped on\na floodlight in a darkened room, and he saw something he had never seen\nbefore.\n\nHe saw that from the first day he had stepped down from the Garvian ship\nthat had brought him to Hospital Earth to begin his medical training, he\nhad been relying upon crutches to help him.\n\nBlack Doctor Arnquist had been a crutch upon whom he could lean. Tiger,\nfor all his clumsy good-heartedness and for all the help and protection\nhe had offered, had been a crutch. Fuzzy, who had been by his side since\nthe day he was born, was still another kind of crutch to fall back on, a\nway out, a port of haven in the storm. They were crutches, every one,\nand he had leaned on them heavily.\n\nBut now there was no crutch to lean on. He had a quick mind with good\ntraining. He had two nimble hands that knew their job, and two legs that\nwere capable of supporting his weight, frail as they were. He knew now\nthat he had to stand on them squarely, for the first time in his life.\n\nAnd suddenly he realized that this was as it should be. It seemed so\nclear, so obvious and unmistakable that he wondered how he could have\nfailed to recognize it for so long. If he could not depend on himself,\nthen Black Doctor Hugo Tanner would have been right all along. If he\ncould not do this job that was before him on his own strength, standing\non his own two legs without crutches to lean on, how could he claim to\nbe a competent physician? What right did he have to the goal he sought\nif he had to earn it on the strength of the help of others? It was _he_\nwho wanted to be a Star Surgeon--not Fuzzy, not Tiger, nor anyone else.\n\nHe felt his heart thudding in his chest, and he saw the operation before\nhim as if he were standing in an amphitheater peering down over some\nother surgeon's shoulder. Suddenly everything else was gone from his\nmind but the immediate task at hand. His fingers began to move more\nswiftly, with a confidence he had never felt before. The decisions to be\nmade arose, and he made them without hesitation, and knew as he made\nthem that they were right.\n\nAnd for the first time the procedure began to move. He murmured\ninstructions to Jack from time to time, and placed Tiger's clumsy hands\nin the places he wanted them for retraction. \"Not there, back a little,\"\nhe said. \"That's right. Now hold this clamp and release it slowly while\nI tie, then reclamp it. Slowly now ... that's the way! Jack, check that\npressure again.\"\n\nIt seemed as though someone else were doing the surgery, directing his\nhands step by step in the critical work that had to be done. Dal placed\nthe connections to the heart-lung machine perfectly, and moved with new\nswiftness and confidence as the great blood vessels were clamped off and\nthe damaged heart removed. A quick check of vital signs, chemistries,\noxygenation, a sharp instruction to Jack, a caution to Tiger, and the\nnew prosthetic heart was in place. He worked now with painstaking care,\nmanipulating the micro-sutures that would secure the new vessels to the\nold so firmly that they were almost indistinguishable from a healed\nwound, and he knew that it was going _right_ now, that whether the\npatient ultimately survived or not, he had made the right decision and\nhad carried it through with all the skill at his command.\n\nAnd then the heart-lung machine fell silent again, and the carefully\napplied nodal stimulator flicked on and off, and slowly, at first\nhesitantly, then firmly and vigorously, the new heart began its endless\npumping chore. The Black Doctor's blood pressure moved up to a healthy\nlevel and stabilized; the gray flesh of his face slowly became suffused\nwith healthy pink. It was over, and Dal was walking out of the surgery,\nhis hands trembling so violently that he could hardly get his gown off.\nHe wanted to laugh and cry at the same time, and he could see the silent\npride in the others' faces as they joined him in the dressing room to\nchange clothes.\n\nHe knew then that no matter what happened he had vindicated himself.\nHalf an hour later, back in the sickbay, the Black Doctor was awake,\nbreathing slowly and easily without need of supplemental oxygen. Only\nthe fine sweat standing out on his forehead gave indication of the\nordeal he had been through.\n\nSwiftly and clinically Dal checked the vital signs as the old man\nwatched him. He was about to turn the pressure cuff over to Jack and\nleave when the Black Doctor said, \"Wait.\"\n\nDal turned to him. \"Yes, sir?\"\n\n\"You did it?\" the Black Doctor said softly.\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"It's finished? The transplant is done?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Dal said. \"It went well, and you can rest now. You were a good\npatient.\"\n\nFor the first time Dal saw a smile cross the old man's face. \"A foolish\npatient, perhaps,\" he said, so softly that no one but Dal could hear,\n\"but not so foolish now, not so foolish that I cannot recognize a good\ndoctor when I see one.\"\n\nAnd with a smile he closed his eyes and went to sleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14\n\nSTAR SURGEON\n\n\nIt was amazing to Dal Timgar just how good it seemed to be back on\nHospital Earth again.\n\nIn the time he had been away as a crewman of the _Lancet_, the seasons\nhad changed, and the port of Philadelphia lay under the steaming summer\nsun. As Dal stepped off the shuttle ship to join the hurrying crowds in\nthe great space-port, it seemed almost as though he were coming home.\n\nHe thought for a moment of the night not so long before when he had\nwaited here for the shuttle to Hospital Seattle, to attend the meeting\nof the medical training council. He had worn no uniform then, not even\nthe collar and cuff of the probationary physician, and he remembered his\ndespair that night when he had thought that his career as a physician\nfrom Hospital Earth was at an end.\n\nNow he was returning by shuttle from Hospital Seattle to the port of\nPhiladelphia again, completing the cycle that had been started many\nmonths before. But things were different now. The scarlet cape of the\nRed Service of Surgery hung from his slender shoulders now, and the\nlight of the station room caught the polished silver emblem on his\ncollar. It was a tiny bit of metal, but its significance was enormous.\nIt announced to the world Dal Timgar's final and permanent acceptance as\na physician; but more, it symbolized the far-reaching distances he had\nalready traveled, and would travel again, in the service of Hospital\nEarth.\n\nIt was the silver star of the Star Surgeon.\n\nThe week just past had been both exciting and confusing. The hospital\nship had arrived five hours after Black Doctor Hugo Tanner had recovered\nfrom his anaesthesia, moving in on the _Lancet_ in frantic haste and\nstarting the shipment of special surgical supplies, anaesthetics and\nmaintenance equipment across in lifeboats almost before contact had been\nstabilized. A large passenger boat hurtled away from the hospital ship's\nside, carrying a pair of Four-star surgeons, half a dozen Three-star\nSurgeons, two Radiologists, two Internists, a dozen nurses and another\nFour-star Black Doctor across to the _Lancet_; and when they arrived at\nthe patrol ship's entrance lock, they discovered that their haste had\nbeen in vain.\n\nIt was like Grand Rounds in the general wards of Hospital Philadelphia,\nwith the Four-star Surgeons in the lead as they tramped aboard the\npatrol ship. They found Black Doctor Tanner sitting quietly at his\nbedside reading a journal of pathology and taking notes. He glared up at\nthem when they burst in the door without even knocking.\n\n\"But are you feeling well, sir?\" the chief surgeon asked him for the\nthird time.\n\n\"Of course I'm feeling well. Do you think I'd be sitting here if I\nweren't?\" the Black Doctor growled. \"Dr. Timgar is my surgeon and the\nphysician in charge of this case. Talk to him. He can give you all the\ndetails of the matter.\"\n\n\"You mean you permitted a probationary physician to perform this kind of\nsurgery?\" The Four-star Surgeon cried incredulously.\n\n\"I did not!\" the Black Doctor snapped. \"He had to drag me kicking and\nscreaming into the operating room. But fortunately for me, this\nparticular probationary physician had the courage of his convictions, as\nwell as wit enough to realize that I would not survive if he waited for\nyou to gather your army together. But I think you will find the surgery\nwas handled with excellent skill. Again, I must refer you to Dr. Timgar\nfor the details. I was not paying attention to the technique of the\nsurgery, I assure you.\"\n\n\"But sir,\" the chief surgeon broke in, \"how could there have been\nsurgery of any sort here? The dispatch that came to us listed the\n_Lancet_ as a plague ship--\"\n\n\"_Plague ship!_\" the Black Doctor exploded. \"Oh, yes. Egad!\nI--hum!--imagine that the dispatcher must have gotten his signals mixed\nsomehow. Well, I suppose you want to examine me. Let's have it over\nwith.\"\n\nThe doctors examined him within an inch of his life. They exhausted\nevery means of physical, laboratory and radiological examination short\nof re-opening his chest and looking in, and at last the chief surgeon\nwas forced reluctantly to admit that there was nothing left for him to\ndo but provide post-operative follow-up care for the irascible old man.\n\nAnd by the time the examination was over and the Black Doctor was moved\naboard the hospital ship, word had come through official channels to the\n_Lancet_ announcing that the quarantine order had been a dispatcher's\nunfortunate error, and directing the ship to return at once to Hospital\nEarth with the new contract that had been signed on 31 Brucker VII. The\ncrewmen of the _Lancet_ had special orders to report immediately to the\nmedical training council at Hospital Seattle upon arrival, in order to\ngive their formal General Practice Patrol reports and to receive their\nappointments respectively as Star Physician, Star Diagnostician and Star\nSurgeon. The orders were signed with the personal mark of Hugo Tanner,\nPhysician of the Black Service of Pathology.\n\nNow the ceremony and celebration in Hospital Seattle were over, and Dal\nhad another appointment to keep. He lifted Fuzzy from his elbow and\ntucked him safely into an inner jacket pocket to protect him from the\ncrowd in the station, and moved swiftly through to the subway tubes.\n\nHe had expected to see Black Doctor Arnquist at the investment\nceremonies, but there had been neither sign nor word from him. Dal tried\nto reach him after the ceremonies were over; all he could learn was that\nthe Black Doctor was unavailable. And then a message had come through to\nDal under the official Hospital Earth headquarters priority, requesting\nhim to present himself at once at the grand council building at Hospital\nPhiladelphia for an interview of the utmost importance.\n\nHe followed the directions on the dispatch now, and reached the grand\ncouncil building well ahead of the appointed time. He followed corridors\nand rode elevators until he reached the twenty-second story office suite\nwhere he had been directed to report. The whole building seemed alive\nwith bustle, as though something of enormous importance was going on;\nhigh-ranking physicians of all the services were hurrying about,\ngathering in little groups at the elevators and talking among themselves\nin hushed voices. Even more strange, Dal saw delegation after delegation\nof alien creatures moving through the building, some in the special\natmosphere-maintaining devices necessary for their survival on Earth,\nsome characteristically alone and unaccompanied, others in the company\nof great retinues of underlings. Dal paused in the main concourse of\nthe building as he saw two such delegations arrive by special car from\nthe port of Philadelphia.\n\n\"Odd,\" he said quietly, reaching in to stroke Fuzzy's head. \"Quite a\ngathering of the clans, eh? What do you think? Last time I saw a\ngathering like this was back at home during one of the centennial\nconclaves of the Galactic Confederation.\"\n\nOn the twenty-second floor, a secretary ushered him into an inner\noffice. There he found Black Doctor Thorvold Arnquist, in busy\nconference with a Blue Doctor, a Green Doctor and a surgeon. The Black\nDoctor looked up, and beamed. \"That will be all right now, gentlemen,\"\nhe said. \"I'll be in touch with you directly.\"\n\nHe waited until the others had departed. Then he crossed the room and\npractically hugged Dal in delight. \"It's good to see you, boy,\" he said,\n\"and above all, it's good to see that silver star at last. You and your\nlittle pink friend have done a good job, a far better job than I thought\nyou would do, I must admit.\"\n\nDal perched Fuzzy on his shoulder. \"But what is this about an interview?\nWhy did you want to see me, and what are all these people doing here?\"\n\nDr. Arnquist laughed. \"Don't worry,\" he said. \"You won't have to stay\nfor the council meeting. It will be a long boring session, I fear.\nDoubtless every single one of these delegates at some time in the next\nfew days will be standing up to give us a three hour oration, and it is\nmy ill fortune as a Four-star Black Doctor to have to sit and listen and\nsmile through it all. But in the end, it will be worth it, and I thought\nthat you should at least know that your name will be mentioned many\ntimes during these sessions.\"\n\n\"My name?\"\n\n\"You didn't know that you were a guinea pig, did you?\" the Black Doctor\nsaid.\n\n\"I ... I'm afraid I didn't.\"\n\n\"An unwitting tool, so to speak,\" the Black Doctor chuckled. \"You know,\nof course, that the Galactic Confederation has been delaying and\nstalling any action on Hospital Earth's application for full status as\none of the Confederation powers and for a seat on the council. We had\nfulfilled two criteria for admission without difficulty--we had resolved\nour problems at home so that we were free from war on our own planet,\nand we had a talent that is much needed and badly in demand in the\ngalaxy, a job to do that would fit into the Confederation's\norganization. But the Confederation has always had a third criterion for\nits membership, a criterion that Hospital Earth could not so easily\nprove or demonstrate.\"\n\nThe Black Doctor smiled. \"After all, there could be no place in a true\nConfederation of worlds for any one race of people that considered\nitself superior to all the rest. No race can be admitted to the\nConfederation until its members have demonstrated that they are capable\nof tolerance, willing to accept the members of other races on an equal\nfooting. And it has always been the nature of Earthmen to be intolerant,\nto assume that one who looks strange and behaves differently must\nsomehow be inferior.\"\n\nThe Black Doctor crossed the room and opened a folder on the desk. \"You\ncan read the details some other time, if you like. You were selected by\nthe Galactic Confederation from a thousand possible applicants, to serve\nas a test case, to see if a place could be made for you on Hospital\nEarth. No one here was told of your position--not even you--although\ncertain of us suspected the truth. The Confederation wanted to see if a\nwell-qualified, likeable and intelligent creature from another world\nwould be accepted and elevated to equal rank as a physician with\nEarthmen.\"\n\nDal stared at him. \"And I was the one?\"\n\n\"You were the one. It was a struggle, all right, but Hospital Earth has\nfinally satisfied the Confederation. At the end of this conclave we will\nbe admitted to full membership and given a permanent seat and vote in\nthe galactic council. Our probationary period will be over. But enough\nof that. What about you? What are your plans? What do you propose to do\nnow that you have that star on your collar?\"\n\nThey talked then about the future. Tiger Martin had been appointed to\nthe survey crew returning to 31 Brucker VII, at his own request, while\nJack was accepting a temporary teaching post in the great diagnostic\nclinic at Hospital Philadelphia. There were a dozen things that Dal had\nconsidered, but for the moment he wanted only to travel from medical\ncenter to medical center on Hospital Earth, observing and studying in\norder to decide how he would best like to use his abilities and his\nposition as a Physician from Hospital Earth. \"It will be in surgery, of\ncourse,\" he said. \"Just where in surgery, or what kind, I don't know\njust yet. But there will be time enough to decide that.\"\n\n\"Then go along,\" Dr. Arnquist said, \"with my congratulations and\nblessing. You have taught us a great deal, and perhaps you have learned\nsome things at the same time.\"\n\nDal hesitated for a moment. Then he nodded. \"I've learned some things,\"\nhe said, \"but there's still one thing that I want to do before I go.\"\n\nHe lifted his little pink friend gently down from his shoulder and\nrested him in the crook of his arm. Fuzzy looked up at him, blinking his\nshoe-button eyes happily. \"You asked me once to leave Fuzzy with you,\nand I refused. I couldn't see then how I could possibly do without him;\neven the thought was frightening. But now I think I've changed my mind.\"\n\nHe reached out and placed Fuzzy gently in the Black Doctor's hand. \"I\nwant you to keep him,\" he said. \"I don't think I'll need him any more.\nI'll miss him, but I think it would be better if I don't have him now.\nBe good to him, and let me visit him once in a while.\"\n\nThe Black Doctor looked at Dal, and then lifted Fuzzy up to his own\nshoulder. For a moment the little creature shivered as if afraid. Then\nhe blinked twice at Dal, trustingly, and snuggled in comfortably against\nthe Black Doctor's neck.\n\nWithout a word Dal turned and walked out of the office. As he stepped\ndown the corridor, he waited fearfully for the wave of desolation and\nloneliness he had felt before when Fuzzy was away from him.\n\nBut there was no hint of those desolate feelings in his mind now. And\nafter all, he thought, why should there be? He was not a Garvian any\nlonger. He was a Star Surgeon from Hospital Earth.\n\nHe smiled as he stepped from the elevator into the main lobby and\ncrossed through the crowd to the street doors. He pulled his scarlet\ncape tightly around his throat. Drawing himself up to the full height of\nwhich he was capable, he walked out of the building and strode down onto\nthe street.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n_Also by Alan E.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
