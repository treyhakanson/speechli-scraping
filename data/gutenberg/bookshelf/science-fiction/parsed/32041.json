He held it up for Casker to admire, then laid it carefully\non the workbench beside the razor.\n\n\"Hell of a meal for two grown men,\" Casker said, flopping down in one\nof the ship's padded crash chairs.\n\n\"If you'd like to give up your share--\" Hellman started to suggest.\n\nCasker shook his head quickly. Hellman smiled, picked up the razor and\nexamined its edge critically.\n\n\"Don't make a production out of it,\" Casker said, glancing at the\nship's instruments. They were approaching a red dwarf, the only\nplanet-bearing sun in the vicinity. \"We want to be through with supper\nbefore we get much closer.\"\n\nHellman made a practice incision in the radish, squinting along the\ntop of the razor. Casker bent closer, his mouth open. Hellman poised\nthe razor delicately and cut the radish cleanly in half.\n\n\"Will you say grace?\" Hellman asked.\n\nCasker growled something and popped a half in his mouth. Hellman\nchewed more slowly. The sharp taste seemed to explode along his\ndisused tastebuds.\n\n\"Not much bulk value,\" Hellman said.\n\nCasker didn't answer. He was busily studying the red dwarf.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs he swallowed the last of his radish, Hellman stifled a sigh. Their\nlast meal had been three days ago ... if two biscuits and a cup of\nwater could be called a meal. This radish, now resting in the vast\nemptiness of their stomachs, was the last gram of food on board ship.\n\n\"Two planets,\" Casker said. \"One's burned to a crisp.\"\n\n\"Then we'll land on the other.\"\n\nCasker nodded and punched a deceleration spiral into the ship's tape.\n\nHellman found himself wondering for the hundredth time where the fault\nhad been. Could he have made out the food requisitions wrong, when\nthey took on supplies at Calao station? After all, he had been\ndevoting most of his attention to the mining equipment. Or had the\nground crew just forgotten to load those last precious cases?\n\nHe drew his belt in to the fourth new notch he had punched.\n\nSpeculation was useless. Whatever the reason, they were in a jam.\nIronically enough, they had more than enough fuel to take them back to\nCalao. But they would be a pair of singularly emaciated corpses by the\ntime the ship reached there.\n\n\"We're coming in now,\" Casker said.\n\nAnd to make matters worse, this unexplored region of space had few\nsuns and fewer planets. Perhaps there was a slight possibility of\nreplenishing their water supply, but the odds were enormous against\nfinding anything they could eat.\n\n\"Look at that place,\" Casker growled.\n\nHellman shook himself out of his reverie.\n\nThe planet was like a round gray-brown porcupine. The spines of a\nmillion needle-sharp mountains glittered in the red dwarf's feeble\nlight. And as they spiraled lower, circling the planet, the pointed\nmountains seemed to stretch out to meet them.\n\n\"It can't be _all_ mountains,\" Hellman said.\n\n\"It's not.\"\n\nSure enough, there were oceans and lakes, out of which thrust jagged\nisland-mountains. But no sign of level land, no hint of civilization,\nor even animal life.\n\n\"At least it's got an oxygen atmosphere,\" Casker said.\n\nTheir deceleration spiral swept them around the planet, cutting lower\ninto the atmosphere, braking against it. And still there was nothing\nbut mountains and lakes and oceans and more mountains.\n\nOn the eighth run, Hellman caught sight of a solitary building on a\nmountain top. Casker braked recklessly, and the hull glowed red hot.\nOn the eleventh run, they made a landing approach.\n\n\"Stupid place to build,\" Casker muttered.\n\nThe building was doughnut-shaped, and fitted nicely over the top of\nthe mountain. There was a wide, level lip around it, which Casker\nscorched as he landed the ship.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom the air, the building had merely seemed big. On the ground, it\nwas enormous. Hellman and Casker walked up to it slowly. Hellman had\nhis burner ready, but there was no sign of life.\n\n\"This planet must be abandoned,\" Hellman said almost in a whisper.\n\n\"Anyone in his right mind would abandon this place,\" Casker said.\n\"There're enough good planets around, without anyone trying to live on\na needle point.\"\n\nThey reached the door. Hellman tried to open it and found it locked.\nHe looked back at the spectacular display of mountains.\n\n\"You know,\" he said, \"when this planet was still in a molten state, it\nmust have been affected by several gigantic moons that are now broken\nup. The strains, external and internal, wrenched it into its present\nspined appearance and--\"\n\n\"Come off it,\" Casker said ungraciously. \"You were a librarian before\nyou decided to get rich on uranium.\"\n\nHellman shrugged his shoulders and burned a hole in the doorlock. They\nwaited.\n\nThe only sound on the mountain top was the growling of their stomachs.\n\nThey entered.\n\nThe tremendous wedge-shaped room was evidently a warehouse of sorts.\nGoods were piled to the ceiling, scattered over the floor, stacked\nhaphazardly against the walls. There were boxes and containers of all\nsizes and shapes, some big enough to hold an elephant, others the size\nof thimbles.\n\nNear the door was a dusty pile of books. Immediately, Hellman bent\ndown to examine them.\n\n\"Must be food somewhere in here,\" Casker said, his face lighting up\nfor the first time in a week. He started to open the nearest box.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"This is interesting,\" Hellman said, discarding all the books except\none.\n\n\"Let's eat first,\" Casker said, ripping the top off the box. Inside\nwas a brownish dust. Casker looked at it, sniffed, and made a face.\n\n\"Very interesting indeed,\" Hellman said, leafing through the book.\n\nCasker opened a small can, which contained a glittering green slime.\nHe closed it and opened another. It contained a dull orange slime.\n\n\"Hmm,\" Hellman said, still reading.\n\n\"Hellman! Will you kindly drop that book and help me find some food?\"\n\n\"Food?\" Hellman repeated, looking up. \"What makes you think there's\nanything to eat here? For all you know, this could be a paint\nfactory.\"\n\n\"It's a warehouse!\" Casker shouted.\n\nHe opened a kidney-shaped can and lifted out a soft purple stick. It\nhardened quickly and crumpled to dust as he tried to smell it. He\nscooped up a handful of the dust and brought it to his mouth.\n\n\"That might be extract of strychnine,\" Hellman said casually.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCasker abruptly dropped the dust and wiped his hands.\n\n\"After all,\" Hellman pointed out, \"granted that this is a warehouse--a\ncache, if you wish--we don't know what the late inhabitants considered\ngood fare. Paris green salad, perhaps, with sulphuric acid as\ndressing.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Casker said, \"but we gotta eat. What're you going to do\nabout all this?\" He gestured at the hundreds of boxes, cans and\nbottles.\n\n\"The thing to do,\" Hellman said briskly, \"is to make a qualitative\nanalysis on four or five samples. We could start out with a simple\ntitration, sublimate the chief ingredient, see if it forms a\nprecipitate, work out its molecular makeup from--\"\n\n\"Hellman, you don't know what you're talking about. You're a\nlibrarian, remember? And I'm a correspondence school pilot. We don't\nknow anything about titrations and sublimations.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Hellman said, \"but we should. It's the right way to go about\nit.\"\n\n\"Sure. In the meantime, though, just until a chemist drops in, what'll\nwe do?\"\n\n\"This might help us,\" Hellman said, holding up the book. \"Do you know\nwhat it is?\"\n\n\"No,\" Casker said, keeping a tight grip on his patience.\n\n\"It's a pocket dictionary and guide to the Helg language.\"\n\n\"Helg?\"\n\n\"The planet we're on. The symbols match up with those on the boxes.\"\n\nCasker raised an eyebrow. \"Never heard of Helg.\"\n\n\"I don't believe the planet has ever had any contact with Earth,\"\nHellman said. \"This dictionary isn't Helg-English. It's\nHelg-Aloombrigian.\"\n\nCasker remembered that Aloombrigia was the home planet of a small,\nadventurous reptilian race, out near the center of the Galaxy.\n\n\"How come you can read Aloombrigian?\" Casker asked.\n\n\"Oh, being a librarian isn't a completely useless profession,\" Hellman\nsaid modestly. \"In my spare time--\"\n\n\"Yeah. Now how about--\"\n\n\"Do you know,\" Hellman said, \"the Aloombrigians probably helped the\nHelgans leave their planet and find another. They sell services like\nthat. In which case, this building very likely is a food cache!\"\n\n\"Suppose you start translating,\" Casker suggested wearily, \"and maybe\nfind us something to eat.\"\n\nThey opened boxes until they found a likely-looking substance.\nLaboriously, Hellman translated the symbols on it.\n\n\"Got it,\" he said. \"It reads:--'USE SNIFFNERS--THE BETTER ABRASIVE.'\"\n\n\"Doesn't sound edible,\" Casker said.\n\n\"I'm afraid not.\"\n\nThey found another, which read: VIGROOM! FILL ALL YOUR STOMACHS, AND\nFILL THEM RIGHT!\n\n\"What kind of animals do you suppose these Helgans were?\" Casker\nasked.\n\nHellman shrugged his shoulders.\n\nThe next label took almost fifteen minutes to translate. It read:\nARGOSEL MAKES YOUR THUDRA ALL TIZZY. CONTAINS THIRTY ARPS OF RAMSTAT\nPULZ, FOR SHELL LUBRICATION.\n\n\"There must be _something_ here we can eat,\" Casker said with a note\nof desperation.\n\n\"I hope so,\" Hellman replied.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt the end of two hours, they were no closer. They had translated\ndozens of titles and sniffed so many substances that their olfactory\nsenses had given up in disgust.\n\n\"Let's talk this over,\" Hellman said, sitting on a box marked:\nVORMITISH--GOOD AS IT SOUNDS!\n\n\"Sure,\" Casker said, sprawling out on the floor. \"Talk.\"\n\n\"If we could deduce what kind of creatures inhabited this planet, we'd\nknow what kind of food they ate, and whether it's likely to be edible\nfor us.\"\n\n\"All we do know is that they wrote a lot of lousy advertising copy.\"\n\nHellman ignored that. \"What kind of intelligent beings would evolve on\na planet that is all mountains?\"\n\n\"Stupid ones!\" Casker said.\n\nThat was no help. But Hellman found that he couldn't draw any\ninferences from the mountains. It didn't tell him if the late Helgans\nate silicates or proteins or iodine-base foods or anything.\n\n\"Now look,\" Hellman said, \"we'll have to work this out by pure\nlogic--Are you listening to me?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Casker said.\n\n\"Okay. There's an old proverb that covers our situation perfectly:\n'One man's meat is another man's poison.'\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Casker said. He was positive his stomach had shrunk to\napproximately the size of a marble.\n\n\"We can assume, first, that their meat is our meat.\"\n\nCasker wrenched himself away from a vision of five juicy roast beefs\ndancing tantalizingly before him. \"What if their meat is our _poison_?\nWhat then?\"\n\n\"Then,\" Hellman said, \"we will assume that their poison is our meat.\"\n\n\"And what happens if their meat _and_ their poison are our poison?\"\n\n\"We starve.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Casker said, standing up. \"Which assumption do we start\nwith?\"\n\n\"Well, there's no sense in asking for trouble. This _is_ an oxygen\nplanet, if that means anything. Let's assume that we can eat some\nbasic food of theirs. If we can't we'll start on their poisons.\"\n\n\"If we live that long,\" Casker said.\n\nHellman began to translate labels. They discarded such brands as\nANDROGYNITES' DELIGHT AND VERBELL--FOR LONGER, CURLIER, MORE SENSITIVE\nANTENNAE, until they found a small gray box, about six inches by three\nby three. It was called VALKORIN'S UNIVERSAL TASTE TREAT, FOR ALL\nDIGESTIVE CAPACITIES.\n\n\"This looks as good as any,\" Hellman said. He opened the box.\n\nCasker leaned over and sniffed. \"No odor.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWithin the box they found a rectangular, rubbery red block. It\nquivered slightly, like jelly.\n\n\"Bite into it,\" Casker said.\n\n\"Me?\" Hellman asked. \"Why not you?\"\n\n\"You picked it.\"\n\n\"I prefer just looking at it,\" Hellman said with dignity. \"I'm not too\nhungry.\"\n\n\"I'm not either,\" Casker said.\n\nThey sat on the floor and stared at the jellylike block. After ten\nminutes, Hellman yawned, leaned back and closed his eyes.\n\n\"All right, coward,\" Casker said bitterly. \"I'll try it. Just\nremember, though, if I'm poisoned, you'll never get off this planet.\nYou don't know how to pilot.\"\n\n\"Just take a little bite, then,\" Hellman advised.\n\nCasker leaned over and stared at the block. Then he prodded it with\nhis thumb.\n\nThe rubbery red block giggled.\n\n\"Did you hear that?\" Casker yelped, leaping back.\n\n\"I didn't hear anything,\" Hellman said, his hands shaking. \"Go ahead.\"\n\nCasker prodded the block again. It giggled louder, this time with a\ndisgusting little simper.\n\n\"Okay,\" Casker said, \"what do we try next?\"\n\n\"Next? What's wrong with this?\"\n\n\"I don't eat anything that giggles,\" Casker stated firmly.\n\n\"Now listen to me,\" Hellman said. \"The creatures who manufactured this\nmight have been trying to create an esthetic sound as well as a\npleasant shape and color. That giggle is probably only for the\namusement of the eater.\"\n\n\"Then bite into it yourself,\" Casker offered.\n\nHellman glared at him, but made no move toward the rubbery block.\nFinally he said, \"Let's move it out of the way.\"\n\nThey pushed the block over to a corner. It lay there giggling softly\nto itself.\n\n\"Now what?\" Casker said.\n\nHellman looked around at the jumbled stacks of incomprehensible alien\ngoods. He noticed a door on either side of the room.\n\n\"Let's have a look in the other sections,\" he suggested.\n\nCasker shrugged his shoulders apathetically.\n\nSlowly they trudged to the door in the left wall. It was locked and\nHellman burned it open with the ship's burner.\n\nIt was a wedge-shaped room, piled with incomprehensible alien goods.\n\nThe hike back across the room seemed like miles, but they made it only\nslightly out of wind. Hellman blew out the lock and they looked in.\n\nIt was a wedge-shaped room, piled with incomprehensible alien goods.\n\n\"All the same,\" Casker said sadly, and closed the door.\n\n\"Evidently there's a series of these rooms going completely around the\nbuilding,\" Hellman said. \"I wonder if we should explore them.\"\n\nCasker calculated the distance around the building, compared it with\nhis remaining strength, and sat down heavily on a long gray object.\n\n\"Why bother?\" he asked.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHellman tried to collect his thoughts. Certainly he should be able to\nfind a key of some sort, a clue that would tell him what they could\neat. But where was it?\n\nHe examined the object Casker was sitting on. It was about the size\nand shape of a large coffin, with a shallow depression on top. It was\nmade of a hard, corrugated substance.\n\n\"What do you suppose this is?\" Hellman asked.\n\n\"Does it matter?\"\n\nHellman glanced at the symbols painted on the side of the object, then\nlooked them up in his dictionary.\n\n\"Fascinating,\" he murmured, after a while.\n\n\"Is it something to eat?\" Casker asked, with a faint glimmering of\nhope.\n\n\"No, You are sitting on something called THE MOROG CUSTOM SUPER\nTRANSPORT FOR THE DISCRIMINATING HELGAN WHO DESIRES THE BEST IN\nVERTICAL TRANSPORTATION. It's a vehicle!\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Casker said dully.\n\n\"This is important! Look at it! How does it work?\"\n\nCasker wearily climbed off the Morog Custom Super Transport and looked\nit over carefully. He traced four almost invisible separations on its\nfour corners. \"Retractable wheels, probably, but I don't see--\"\n\nHellman read on. \"It says to give it three amphus of high-gain Integor\nfuel, then a van of Tonder lubrication, and not to run it over three\nthousand Ruls for the first fifty mungus.\"\n\n\"Let's find something to eat,\" Casker said.\n\n\"Don't you see how important this is?\" Hellman asked. \"This could\nsolve our problem. If we could deduce the alien logic inherent in\nconstructing this vehicle, we might know the Helgan thought pattern.\nThis, in turn, would give us an insight into their nervous systems,\nwhich would imply their biochemical makeup.\"\n\nCasker stood still, trying to decide whether he had enough strength\nleft to strangle Hellman.\n\n\"For example,\" Hellman said, \"what kind of vehicle would be used in a\nplace like this? Not one with wheels, since everything is up and down.\nAnti-gravity? Perhaps, but what _kind_ of anti-gravity? And why did\nthe inhabitants devise a boxlike form instead--\"\n\nCasker decided sadly that he didn't have enough strength to strangle\nHellman, no matter how pleasant it might be. Very quietly, he said,\n\"Kindly stop making like a scientist. Let's see if there isn't\n_something_ we can gulp down.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Hellman said sulkily.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCasker watched his partner wander off among the cans, bottles and\ncases. He wondered vaguely where Hellman got the energy, and decided\nthat he was just too cerebral to know when he was starving.\n\n\"Here's something,\" Hellman called out, standing in front of a large\nyellow vat.\n\n\"What does it say?\" Casker asked.\n\n\"Little bit hard to translate. But rendered freely, it reads:\nMORISHILLE'S VOOZY, WITH LACTO-ECTO ADDED FOR A NEW TASTE SENSATION.\nEVERYONE DRINKS VOOZY. GOOD BEFORE AND AFTER MEALS, NO UNPLEASANT\nAFTER-EFFECTS. GOOD FOR CHILDREN! THE DRINK OF THE UNIVERSE!\"\n\n\"That sounds good,\" Casker admitted, thinking that Hellman might not\nbe so stupid after all.\n\n\"This should tell us once and for all if their meat _is_ our meat,\"\nHellman said. \"This Voozy seems to be the closest thing to a universal\ndrink I've found yet.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" Casker said hopefully, \"maybe it's just plain water!\"\n\n\"We'll see.\" Hellman pried open the lid with the edge of the burner.\n\nWithin the vat was a crystal-clear liquid.\n\n\"No odor,\" Casker said, bending over the vat.\n\nThe crystal liquid lifted to meet him.\n\nCasker retreated so rapidly that he fell over a box. Hellman helped\nhim to his feet, and they approached the vat again. As they came near,\nthe liquid lifted itself three feet into the air and moved toward\nthem.\n\n\"What've you done now?\" Casker asked, moving back carefully. The\nliquid flowed slowly over the side of the vat. It began to flow toward\nhim.\n\n\"Hellman!\" Casker shrieked.\n\nHellman was standing to one side, perspiration pouring down his face,\nreading his dictionary with a preoccupied frown.\n\n\"Guess I bumbled the translation,\" he said.\n\n\"Do something!\" Casker shouted. The liquid was trying to back him into\na corner.\n\n\"Nothing I can do,\" Hellman said, reading on. \"Ah, here's the error.\nIt doesn't say 'Everyone drinks Voozy.' Wrong subject. 'Voozy drinks\n_everyone_.' That tells us something! The Helgans must have soaked\nliquid in through their pores. Naturally, they would prefer to be\ndrunk, instead of to drink.\"\n\nCasker tried to dodge around the liquid, but it cut him off with a\nmerry gurgle. Desperately he picked up a small bale and threw it at\nthe Voozy. The Voozy caught the bale and drank it. Then it discarded\nthat and turned back to Casker.\n\nHellman tossed another box. The Voozy drank this one and a third and\nfourth that Casker threw in. Then, apparently exhausted, it flowed\nback into its vat.\n\nCasker clapped down the lid and sat on it, trembling violently.\n\n\"Not so good,\" Hellman said. \"We've been taking it for granted that\nthe Helgans had eating habits like us. But, of course, it doesn't\nnecessarily--\"\n\n\"No, it doesn't. No, sir, it certainly doesn't. I guess we can see\nthat it doesn't. Anyone can see that it doesn't--\"\n\n\"Stop that,\" Hellman ordered sternly. \"We've no time for hysteria.\"\n\n\"Sorry.\" Casker slowly moved away from the Voozy vat.\n\n\"I guess we'll have to assume that their meat is our poison,\" Hellman\nsaid thoughtfully. \"So now we'll see if their poison is our meat.\"\n\nCasker didn't say anything. He was wondering what would have happened\nif the Voozy had drunk him.\n\nIn the corner, the rubbery block was still giggling to itself.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Now here's a likely-looking poison,\" Hellman said, half an hour\nlater.\n\nCasker had recovered completely, except for an occasional twitch of\nthe lips.\n\n\"What does it say?\" he asked.\n\nHellman rolled a tiny tube in the palm of his hand. \"It's called\nPvastkin's Plugger. The label reads: WARNING! HIGHLY DANGEROUS!\nPVASTKIN'S PLUGGER IS DESIGNED TO FILL HOLES OR CRACKS OF NOT MORE\nTHAN TWO CUBIC VIMS. HOWEVER--THE PLUGGER IS NOT TO BE EATEN UNDER ANY\nCIRCUMSTANCES. THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT, RAMOTOL, WHICH MAKES PVASTKIN'S\nSO EXCELLENT A PLUGGER RENDERS IT HIGHLY DANGEROUS WHEN TAKEN\nINTERNALLY.\"\n\n\"Sounds great,\" Casker said. \"It'll probably blow us sky-high.\"\n\n\"Do you have any other suggestions?\" Hellman asked.\n\nCasker thought for a moment. The food of Helg was obviously\nunpalatable for humans. So perhaps was their poison ... but wasn't\nstarvation better than this sort of thing?\n\nAfter a moment's communion with his stomach, he decided that\nstarvation was _not_ better.\n\n\"Go ahead,\" he said.\n\nHellman slipped the burner under his arm and unscrewed the top of the\nlittle bottle. He shook it.\n\nNothing happened.\n\n\"It's got a seal,\" Casker pointed out.\n\nHellman punctured the seal with his fingernail and set the bottle on\nthe floor. An evil-smelling green froth began to bubble out.\n\nHellman looked dubiously at the froth. It was congealing into a glob\nand spreading over the floor.\n\n\"Yeast, perhaps,\" he said, gripping the burner tightly.\n\n\"Come, come. Faint heart never filled an empty stomach.\"\n\n\"I'm not holding _you_ back,\" Hellman said.\n\nThe glob swelled to the size of a man's head.\n\n\"How long is that supposed to go on?\" Casker asked.\n\n\"Well,\" Hellman said, \"it's advertised as a Plugger. I suppose that's\nwhat it does--expands to plug up holes.\"\n\n\"Sure. But how _much_?\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, I don't know how much two cubic vims are. But it can't\ngo on much--\"\n\nBelatedly, they noticed that the Plugger had filled almost a quarter\nof the room and was showing no signs of stopping.\n\n\"We should have believed the label!\" Casker yelled to him, across the\nspreading glob. \"It _is_ dangerous!\"\n\nAs the Plugger produced more surface, it began to accelerate in its\ngrowth. A sticky edge touched Hellman, and he jumped back.\n\n\"Watch out!\"\n\nHe couldn't reach Casker, on the other side of the gigantic sphere of\nblob. Hellman tried to run around, but the Plugger had spread, cutting\nthe room in half. It began to swell toward the walls.\n\n\"Run for it!\" Hellman yelled, and rushed to the door behind him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe flung it open just as the expanding glob reached him. On the other\nside of the room, he heard a door slam shut. Hellman didn't wait any\nlonger. He sprinted through and slammed the door behind him.\n\nHe stood for a moment, panting, the burner in his hand. He hadn't\nrealized how weak he was. That sprint had cut his reserves of energy\ndangerously close to the collapsing point. At least Casker had made\nit, too, though.\n\nBut he was still in trouble.\n\nThe Plugger poured merrily through the blasted lock, into the room.\nHellman tried a practice shot on it, but the Plugger was evidently\nimpervious ... as, he realized, a good plugger should be.\n\nIt was showing no signs of fatigue.\n\nHellman hurried to the far wall. The door was locked, as the others\nhad been, so he burned out the lock and went through.\n\nHow far could the glob expand? How much was two cubic vims? Two cubic\nmiles, perhaps? For all he knew, the Plugger was used to repair faults\nin the crusts of planets.\n\nIn the next room, Hellman stopped to catch his breath. He remembered\nthat the building was circular. He would burn his way through the\nremaining doors and join Casker. They would burn their way outside\nand....\n\nCasker didn't have a burner!\n\nHellman turned white with shock. Casker had made it into the room on\nthe right, because they had burned it open earlier. The Plugger was\nundoubtedly oozing into that room, through the shattered lock ... and\nCasker couldn't get out! The Plugger was on his left, a locked door on\nhis right!\n\nRallying his remaining strength, Hellman began to run. Boxes seemed to\nget in his way purposefully, tripping him, slowing him down. He\nblasted the next door and hurried on to the next. And the next. And\nthe next.\n\nThe Plugger couldn't expand _completely_ into Casker's room!\n\nOr could it?\n\nThe wedge-shaped rooms, each a segment of a circle, seemed to stretch\nbefore him forever, a jumbled montage of locked doors, alien goods,\nmore doors, more goods. Hellman fell over a crate, got to his feet and\nfell again. He had reached the limit of his strength, and passed it.\nBut Casker was his friend.\n\nBesides, without a pilot, he'd never get off the place.\n\nHellman struggled through two more rooms on trembling legs and then\ncollapsed in front of a third.\n\n\"Is that you, Hellman?\" he heard Casker ask, from the other side of\nthe door.\n\n\"You all right?\" Hellman managed to gasp.\n\n\"Haven't much room in here,\" Casker said, \"but the Plugger's stopped\ngrowing. Hellman, get me out of here!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHellman lay on the floor panting. \"Moment,\" he said.\n\n\"Moment, hell!\" Casker shouted. \"Get me out. I've found water!\"\n\n\"What? How?\"\n\n\"Get me out of here!\"\n\nHellman tried to stand up, but his legs weren't cooperating. \"What\nhappened?\" he asked.\n\n\"When I saw that glob filling the room, I figured I'd try to start up\nthe Super Custom Transport. Thought maybe it could knock down the door\nand get me out. So I pumped it full of high-gain Integor fuel.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" Hellman said, still trying to get his legs under control.\n\n\"That Super Custom Transport is an animal, Hellman! And the Integor\nfuel is water! Now get me out!\"\n\nHellman lay back with a contented sigh. If he had had a little more\ntime, he would have worked out the whole thing himself, by pure logic.\nBut it was all very apparent now. The most efficient machine to go\nover those vertical, razor-sharp mountains would be an animal,\nprobably with retractable suckers. It was kept in hibernation between\ntrips; and if it drank water, the other products designed for it would\nbe palatable, too. Of course they still didn't know much about the\nlate inhabitants, but undoubtedly....\n\n\"Burn down that door!\" Casker shrieked, his voice breaking.\n\nHellman was pondering the irony of it all. If one man's meat--_and_\nhis poison--are your poison, then try eating something else. So\nsimple, really.\n\nBut there was one thing that still bothered him.\n\n\"How did you know it was an Earth-type animal?\" he asked.\n\n\"Its breath, stupid! It inhales and exhales and smells as if it's\neaten onions!\" There was a sound of cans falling and bottles\nshattering. \"Now hurry!\"\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Hellman asked, finally getting to his feet and poising\nthe burner.\n\n\"The Custom Super Transport. It's got me cornered behind a pile of\ncases. Hellman, it seems to think that I'm _its_ meat!\"\n\nBroiled with the burner--well done for Hellman, medium rare for\nCasker--it was their meat, with enough left over for the trip back to\nCalao.\n\n                                                       --ROBERT SHECKLEY\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of One Man's Poison, by Robert Sheckley\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ONE MAN'S POISON ***\n\n***** This file should be named 32041.txt or 32041.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/2/0/4/32041/\n\nProduced by Sankar Viswanathan, Greg Weeks, and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
