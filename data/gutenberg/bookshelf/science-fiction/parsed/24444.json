But the case of the Vanishing\n     Delinquents was at least as bad...._=\n\nIllustrated by Freas\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe sidewalk was as soft as a good bed. Malone lay curled on it thinking\nabout nothing at all. He was drifting off into a wonderful dream and he\ndidn't want to interrupt it. There was this girl, a beautiful girl, more\nwonderful than anything he had ever imagined, with big blue eyes and\nlong blond hair and a figure that made the average pin-up girl look like\na man. And she had her soft white hand on his arm, and she was looking\nup at him with trust and devotion and even adoration in her eyes, and\nher voice was the softest possible whisper of innocence and promise.\n\n\"I'd love to go up to your apartment with you, Mr. Malone,\" she said.\n\nMalone smiled back at her, gently but with complete confidence. \"Call me\nKen,\" he said, noticing that he was seven feet tall and superbly\nmuscled. He put his free hand on the girl's warm, soft shoulder and she\nwriggled with delight.\n\n\"All right--Ken,\" she said. \"You know, I've never met anyone like you\nbefore. I mean, you're so wonderful and everything.\"\n\nMalone chuckled modestly, realizing, in passing, how full and rich his\nvoice had become. He felt a weight pressing over his heart, and knew\nthat it was his wallet, stuffed to bursting with thousand-dollar bills.\n\nBut was this a time to think of money?\n\nNo, Malone told himself. This was the time for adventure, for romance,\nfor love. He looked down at the girl and put his arm around her waist.\nShe snuggled closer.\n\nHe led her easily down the long wide street to his car at the end of the\nblock. It stood in godlike solitude, a beautiful red Cadillac capable of\ngoing a hundred and ten miles an hour in any gear, equipped with fully\nautomatic steering and braking, and with stereophonic radio, a hi-fi and\na 3-D set installed in both front and back seats. It was a 1972 job, but\nhe meant to trade it in on something even better when the 1973 models\ncame out. In the meantime, he decided, it would do.\n\nHe handed the girl in, went round to the other side and slid in under\nthe wheel. There was soft music playing, somewhere, and a magnificent\nsunset appeared ahead of them as Malone pushed a button on the dashboard\nand the red Cadillac started off down the wide, empty, wonderfully paved\nstreet into the sunset while he--\n\nThe red Cadillac?\n\nThe sidewalk became a little harder, and Malone suddenly realized that\nhe was lying on it. Something terrible had happened; he knew that right\naway. He opened his eyes to look for the girl, but the sunset had become\nmuch brighter; his head began to pound with the slow regularity of a\ndead-march and he closed his eyes again in a hurry.\n\nThe sidewalk swayed a little but he managed to keep his balance on it\nsomehow, and after a couple of minutes it was quiet again. His head\nhurt. Maybe that was the terrible thing that had happened, but Malone\nwasn't quite sure. As a matter of fact, he wasn't very sure about\nanything, and he started to ask himself questions to make certain he was\nall there.\n\nHe didn't feel all there. He felt as if several of his parts had been\nreplaced with second-or even third-hand experimental models, and\nsomething had happened to the experiment. It was even hard to think of\nany questions, but after a while he managed to come up with a few.\n\n_What is your name?_\n\nKenneth Malone.\n\n_Where do you live?_\n\nWashington, D. C.\n\n_What is your work?_\n\nI work for the FBI.\n\n_Then what are you doing on a sidewalk in New York in broad daylight?_\n\nHe tried to find an answer to that, but there didn't seem to be any, no\nmatter where he looked. The only thing he could think of was the red\nCadillac.\n\nAnd if the red Cadillac had anything to do with anything, Malone didn't\nknow about it.\n\nVery slowly and carefully, he opened his eyes again, one at a time. He\ndiscovered that the light was not coming from the gorgeous Hollywood\nsunset he had dreamed up. As a matter of fact, sunset was several hours\nin the past, and it never looked very pretty in New York anyhow. It was\nthe middle of the night, and Malone was lying under a convenient street\nlamp.\n\nHe closed his eyes again and waited patiently for his head to go away.\n\nA few minutes passed. It was obvious that his head had settled down for\na long stay, and no matter how bad it felt, Malone told himself, it\n_was_ his head, after all. He felt a certain responsibility for it. And\nhe couldn't just leave it lying around somewhere with its eyes closed.\n\nHe opened the head's eyes once more, and this time he kept them open.\nFor a long time he stared at the post of the street lamp, considering\nit, and he finally decided that it looked sturdy enough to support a\nhundred and sixty-five pounds of FBI man, even with the head added in.\nHe grabbed for the post with both hands and started to pull himself\nupright, noticing vaguely that his legs had somehow managed to get\nunderneath him.\n\nAs soon as he was standing, he wished he'd stayed on the nice horizontal\nsidewalk. His head was spinning dizzily and his mind was being sucked\ndown into the whirlpool. He held on to the post grimly and tried to stay\nconscious.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA long time, possibly two or three seconds, passed. Malone hadn't moved\nat all when the two cops came along.\n\nOne of them was a big man with a brassy voice and a face that looked as\nif it had been overbaked in a waffle-iron. He came up behind Malone and\ntapped him on the shoulder, but Malone barely felt the touch. Then the\ncop bellowed into Malone's ear.\n\n\"What's the matter, buddy?\"\n\nMalone appreciated the man's sympathy. It was good to know that you had\nfriends. But he wished, remotely, that the cop and his friend, a shorter\nand thinner version of the beat patrolman, would go away and leave him\nin peace. Maybe he could lie down on the sidewalk again and get a couple\nof hundred years' rest.\n\nWho could tell?\n\n\"Mallri,\" he said.\n\n\"You're all right?\" the big cop said. \"That's fine. That's great. So why\ndon't you go home and sleep it off?\"\n\n\"Sleep?\" Malone said. \"Home?\"\n\n\"Wherever you live, buddy,\" the big cop said. \"Come on. Can't stand\naround on the sidewalk all night.\"\n\nMalone shook his head, and decided at once never to do it again. He had\nsome kind of rare disease, he realized. His brain was loose, and the\ninside of his skull was covered with sandpaper. Every time his head\nmoved, the brain jounced against some of the sandpaper.\n\nBut the policeman thought he was drunk. That wasn't right. He couldn't\nlet the police get the wrong impression of FBI agents. Now the man would\ngo around telling people that the FBI was always drunk and disorderly.\n\n\"Not drunk,\" he said clearly.\n\n\"Sure,\" the big cop said. \"You're fine. Maybe just one too many, huh?\"\n\n\"No,\" Malone said. The effort exhausted him and he had to catch his\nbreath before he could say anything else. But the cops waited patiently.\nAt last he said: \"Somebody slugged me.\"\n\n\"Slugged?\" the big cop said.\n\n\"Right.\" Malone remembered just in time not to nod his head.\n\n\"How about a description, buddy?\" the big cop said.\n\n\"Didn't see him,\" Malone said. He let go of the post with one hand,\nkeeping a precarious grip with the other. He stared at his watch. The\nhands danced back and forth, but he focused on them after a while. It\nwas 1:05. \"Happened just--a few minutes ago,\" he said. \"Maybe you can\ncatch him.\"\n\nThe big cop said: \"Nobody around here. The place is deserted--except for\nyou, buddy.\" He paused and then added: \"Let's see some identification,\nhuh? Or did he take your wallet?\"\n\nMalone thought about getting the wallet, and decided against it. The\nmotions required would be a little tricky, and he wasn't sure he could\nmanage them without letting go of the post entirely. At last he decided\nto let the cop get his wallet. \"Inside coat pocket,\" he said.\n\nThe other policeman blinked and looked up. His face was a studied blank.\n\"Hey, buddy,\" he said. \"You know you got blood on your head?\"\n\nThe big cop said: \"Sam's right. You're bleeding, mister.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Malone said.\n\nThe big cop said: \"Huh?\"\n\n\"I thought maybe my skull was going to explode from high blood\npressure,\" Malone said. It was beginning to be a little easier to talk.\n\"But as long as there's a slow leak, I guess I'm out of danger.\"\n\n\"Get his wallet,\" the smaller cop--Sam--said. \"I'll watch him.\"\n\nA hand went into Malone's jacket pocket. It tickled a little bit, but\nMalone didn't think of objecting. Naturally enough, the hand and\nMalone's wallet did not make an instant connection. When the hand\ntouched the bulky object strapped near Malone's armpit it stopped,\nfrozen, and then cautiously snaked the object out.\n\n\"What's that, Bill?\" Sam said.\n\nBill looked up with the object in his hand. He seemed a little dazed.\n\"It's a gun,\" he said.\n\n\"The guy's heeled!\" Sam said. \"Watch him! Don't let him get away!\"\n\nMalone considered getting away, and decided that he couldn't move. \"It's\nO.K.,\" he said.\n\n\"O.K., hell,\" Sam said. \"It's a .44 Magnum. What are you doing with a\ngun, Mac?\" He was no longer polite and friendly. \"Why you carrying a\ngun?\" he said.\n\n\"I'm not carrying it,\" Malone said tiredly. \"Bill is. Your pal.\"\n\nBill backed away from Malone, putting the Magnum in his pocket and\nkeeping the FBI agent covered with his own Police Positive. At the same\ntime, he fished out the personal radio every patrolman carried in his\nuniform, and began calling for a prowl car in a low, somewhat nervous\nvoice.\n\nSam said: \"A gun. He could of shot everybody.\"\n\n\"Get his wallet,\" Bill said. \"He can't hurt you now. I disarmed him.\"\n\nMalone began to feel slightly dangerous. Maybe he _was_ a famous\ngangster. He wasn't sure. Maybe all this about being an FBI agent was\njust a figment of his imagination. Blows on the head did funny things.\n\"I'll drill everybody full of holes,\" he said in a harsh, underworld\nsort of voice, but it didn't sound very convincing. Sam approached him\ngently and fished out his wallet with great care, as if Malone were a\nticking bomb ready to go off any second.\n\nThere was a little silence. Then Sam said: \"Give him his gun back,\nBill,\" in a hushed and respectful tone.\n\n\"Give him back his gun?\" the big cop said. \"You gone nuts, Sam?\"\n\nSam shook his head slowly. \"Nope,\" he said. \"But we made a terrible\nmistake. Know who this guy is?\"\n\n\"He's heeled,\" Bill said. \"That's all I want to know.\" He put the radio\naway and gave all his attention to Malone.\n\n\"He's FBI,\" Sam said. \"The wallet says so. Badge and everything. And not\nonly that, Bill. He's Kenneth J. Malone.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWell, Malone thought with relief, that settled that. He wasn't a\ngangster after all. He was just the FBI agent he had always known and\nloved. Maybe now the cops would do something about his head and take him\naway for burial.\n\n\"Malone?\" Bill said. \"You mean the guy who's here about all those red\nCadillacs?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Sam said. \"So give him his gun back.\" He looked at Malone.\n\"Listen, Mr. Malone,\" he said. \"We're sorry. We're sorry as hell.\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" Malone said absently. He moved his head slowly and\nlooked around. His suspicions were confirmed. There wasn't a red\nCadillac anywhere in sight, and from the looks of the street there never\nhad been. \"It's gone,\" he said, but the cops weren't listening.\n\n\"We better get you to a hospital,\" Bill said. \"As soon as the prowl car\ngets here we'll take you right on down to St. Vincent's. Can you tell us\nwhat happened? Or is it--classified?\"\n\nMalone wondered what could be classified about a blow on the head, and\ndecided not to think about it. \"I can tell you,\" he said, \"if you'll\nanswer one question for me.\"\n\n\"Sure, Mr. Malone,\" Bill said. \"We'll be glad to help.\"\n\n\"Anything at all,\" Sam said.\n\nMalone gave them what he hoped was a gracious and condescending smile.\n\"All right, then,\" he said. \"Where the hell am I?\"\n\n\"In New York,\" Sam said.\n\n\"I know that,\" Malone said tiredly. \"Anywhere in particular, or just\nsort of all over New York?\"\n\n\"Ninth Street,\" Bill said hurriedly. \"Near the Village. Is that where\nyou were when they slugged you?\"\n\n\"I guess so,\" Malone said. \"Sure.\" He nodded, and immediately remembered\nthat he shouldn't have. He closed his eyes until the pain had softened\nto agony, and then opened them again. \"I was getting pretty tired of\nsitting around waiting for something to break on this case,\" he said,\n\"and I couldn't sleep, so I went out for a walk. I ended up in Greenwich\nVillage--which is no place for a self-respecting man to end up.\"\n\n\"I know just what you mean,\" Sam said sympathetically. \"Bohemians, they\ncall themselves. Crazy people.\"\n\n\"Not the people,\" Malone said. \"The streets. I got sort of lost.\"\nChicago, he reflected, was a long way from the easiest city in the world\nto get around in. And he supposed you could even get confused in\nWashington if you tried hard enough. But he knew those cities. He could\nfind his way around in them. Greenwich Village was different.\n\nIt was harder to navigate in than the trackless forests of the Amazon.\nThe Village had tracks, all right--thousands of tracks. Only none of\nthem led anywhere in particular.\n\n\"Anyhow,\" Malone said, \"I saw this red Cadillac.\"\n\nThe cops looked around hurriedly and then looked back at Malone. Bill\nstarted to say: \"But there isn't any--\"\n\n\"I know,\" Malone said. \"It's gone now. That's the trouble.\"\n\n\"You mean somebody got in and drove it away?\" Sam said.\n\n\"For all I know,\" Malone said, \"it sprouted wings and flew away.\" He\npaused. \"When I saw it I decided to go over and have a look. Just in\ncase.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Bill said. \"Makes sense.\" He stared at his partner as if defying\nhim to prove it didn't make sense. Malone didn't really care.\n\n\"There wasn't anybody else on the street,\" he said, \"so I walked over\nand tried the door. That's all. I didn't even open the car or anything.\nAnd I'll swear there was nobody behind me.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Sam said, \"the street was empty when we got here.\"\n\n\"But a guy could have driven off in that red Cadillac before we got\nhere,\" Bill said.\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"But where did he come from? I figured maybe\nsomebody dropped something by mistake--a safe or something. Because\nthere wasn't anybody behind me.\"\n\n\"There had to be,\" Bill said.\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"there wasn't.\"\n\nThere was a little silence.\n\n\"What happened then?\" Sam said. \"After you tried the door handle, I\nmean.\"\n\n\"Then?\" Malone said. \"Then, I went out like a light.\"\n\nA pair of headlights rounded the nearby corner. Bill looked up. \"That's\nthe prowl car,\" he announced, and went over to meet it.\n\nThe driver was a solidly-built little man with the face of a Pekingese.\nHis partner, a tall man who looked as if he'd have been much more\ncomfortable in a ten-gallon Stetson instead of the regulation blue cap,\nleaned out at Bill, Sam and Malone.\n\n\"What's the trouble here?\" he said in a harsh, high voice.\n\n\"No trouble,\" Bill said, and went over to the car. He began talking to\nthe two cops inside in a low, urgent voice. Meanwhile, Sam got his arm\naround Malone and began pulling him away from the lamp post.\n\nMalone was a little unwilling to let go, at first. But Sam was stronger\nthan he looked. He convoyed the FBI agent carefully to the rear door of\nthe prowl car, opened it and levered Malone gently to a seat inside,\njust as Bill said: \"So with the cut and all, we figured he ought to go\nover to St. Vincent's. You people were already on the way, so we didn't\nbother with ambulances.\"\n\nThe driver snorted. \"Next time you want taxi service,\" he said, \"you\njust call us up. What do you think, a prowl car's an easy life?\"\n\n\"Easier than doing a beat,\" Bill said mournfully. \"And anyway,\" he added\nin a low, penetrating whisper, \"the guy's FBI.\"\n\n\"So the FBI's got all kinds of equipment,\" the driver said. \"The latest.\nWhy don't he whistle up a helicopter or a jet?\" Then, apparently\ndeciding that further invective would get him nowhere, he settled back\nin his seat, said: \"Aah, forget it,\" and started the car with a small\nbut perceptible jerk.\n\nMalone decided not to get into the argument. He was tired, and it was\nlate. He rested his head on the back seat and tried to relax, but all\nhe could do was think about red Cadillacs.\n\nHe wished he had never even heard of red Cadillacs.\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nAnd it had all started so simply, too. Malone remembered very clearly\nthe first time he had had any indication that red Cadillacs were\nanything unusual, or special. Before that, he'd viewed them all with\nslightly wistful eyes: red, blue, green, gray, white or even black\nCadillacs were all the same to him. They spelled luxury and wealth and\ndisplay and a lot of other nice things.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nNow, he wasn't at all sure what they spelled. Except that it was\ndefinitely uncomfortable, and highly baffling.\n\nHe'd walked into the offices of Andrew J. Burris, Director of the FBI,\njust one week ago. It was a beautiful office, pine paneled and spacious,\nand it boasted an enormous polished desk. And behind the desk Burris\nhimself sat, looking both tired and somehow a little kindly.\n\n\"You sent for me, chief?\" Malone said.\n\n\"That's right.\" Burris nodded. \"Malone, you've been working too hard\nlately.\"\n\nNow, Malone thought, it was coming. The dismissal he'd always feared. At\nleast Burris had found out that he wasn't the bright, intelligent,\nfearless and alert FBI agent he was supposed to be. Burris had\ndiscovered that he was nothing more or less than lucky, and that all the\n\"fine jobs\" he was supposed to have done were only the result of luck.\n\nOh, well, Malone thought. Not being an FBI agent wouldn't be so bad. He\ncould always find another job.\n\nOnly at the moment he couldn't think of one he liked.\n\nHe decided to make one last plea.\n\n\"I haven't been working so hard, chief,\" he said. \"Not too hard, anyhow.\nI'm in great shape. I--\"\n\n\"I've taken advantage of you, Malone, that's what I've done,\" Burris\nsaid, just as if Malone hadn't spoken at all. \"Just because you're the\nbest agent I've got, that's no reason for me to hand you all the tough\nones.\"\n\n\"Just because I'm what?\" Malone said, feeling slightly faint.\n\n\"I've given you the tough ones because you could handle them,\" Burris\nsaid. \"But that's no reason to keep loading jobs on you. After that job\nyou did on the Gorelik kidnapping, and the way you wrapped up the\nTransom counterfeit ring ... well, Malone, I think you need a little\nrelaxation.\"\n\n\"Relaxation?\" Malone said, feeling just a little bit pleased. Of course,\nhe didn't deserve any of the praise he was getting, he knew. He'd just\nhappened to walk in on the Gorelik kidnappers because his telephone had\nbeen out of order. And the Transom ring hadn't been just his job. After\nall, if other agents hadn't managed to trace the counterfeit bills back\nto a common area in Cincinnati, he'd never have been able to complete\nhis part of the assignment. But it was nice to be praised, anyhow.\nMalone felt a twinge of guilt, and told himself sternly to relax and\nenjoy himself.\n\n\"That's what I said,\" Burris told him. \"Relaxation.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"I certainly would like a vacation, that's for\nsure. I'd like to snooze for a couple of weeks--or maybe go up to Cape\nCod for a while. There's a lot of nice scenery up around there. It's\nrestful, sort of, and I could just--\"\n\nHe stopped. Burris was frowning, and when Andrew J. Burris frowned it\nwas a good idea to look attentive, interested and alert. \"Now, Malone,\"\nBurris said sadly, \"I wasn't thinking about a vacation. You're not\nscheduled for one until August, you know--\"\n\n\"Oh, I know, chief,\" Malone said. \"But I thought--\"\n\n\"Much as I'd like to,\" Burris said, \"I just can't make an exception; you\nknow that, Malone. I've got to go pretty much by the schedule.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Malone said, feeling just a shade disappointed.\n\n\"But I do think you deserve a rest,\" Burris said.\n\n\"Well, if I--\"\n\n\"Here's what I'm going to do,\" Burris said, and paused. Malone felt a\nlittle unsure as to exactly what his chief was talking about, but by now\nhe knew better than to ask a lot of questions. Sooner or later, Burris\nwould probably explain himself. And if he didn't, then there was no use\nworrying about it. That was just the way Burris acted.\n\n\"Suppose I gave you a chance to take it easy for a while,\" Burris said.\n\"You could catch up on your sleep, see some shows, have a couple of\ndrinks during the evening, take girls out for dinner--you know.\nSomething like that. How would you like it?\"\n\n\"Well--\" Malone said cautiously.\n\n\"Good,\" Burris said. \"I knew you would.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMalone opened his mouth, thought briefly and closed it again. After all,\nit did sound sort of promising, and if there was a catch in it he'd find\nout about it soon enough.\n\n\"It's really just a routine case,\" Burris said in an offhand tone.\n\"Nothing to it.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said.\n\n\"There's this red Cadillac,\" Burris said. \"It was stolen from a party in\nConnecticut, out near Danbury, and it showed up in New York City. Now,\nthe car's crossed a state line.\"\n\n\"That puts it in our jurisdiction,\" Malone said, feeling obvious.\n\n\"Right,\" Burris said. \"Right on the nose.\"\n\n\"But the New York office--\"\n\n\"Naturally, they're in charge of everything,\" Burris said. \"But I'm\nsending you out as sort of a special observer. Just keep your eyes open\nand nose around and let me know what's happening.\"\n\n\"Keep my eyes and nose what?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Open,\" Burris said. \"And let me know about it.\"\n\nMalone tried to picture himself with his eyes and nose open, and decided\nhe didn't look very attractive that way. Well, it was only a figure of\nspeech or something. He didn't have to think about it.\n\nIt really made a very ugly picture.\n\n\"But why a special observer?\" he said after a second. Burris could read\nthe reports from the New York office, and probably get more facts than\nany single agent could find out just wandering around a strange city. It\nsounded as if there were something, Malone told himself, just a tiny\nshade rotten in Denmark. It sounded as if there were going to be\nsomething in the nice, easy assignment he was getting that would make\nhim wish he'd gone lion-hunting in Darkest Africa instead.\n\nAnd then again, maybe he was wrong. He stood at ease and waited to find\nout.\n\n\"Well,\" Burris said, \"it is just a routine case. Just like I said. But\nthere seems to be something a little bit odd about it.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Malone said with a sinking feeling.\n\n\"Here's what happened,\" Burris said hurriedly, as if he were afraid\nMalone was going to change his mind and refuse the assignment. \"This red\nCadillac I told you about was reported stolen from Danbury. Three days\nlater, it turned up in New York City--parked smack across the street\nfrom a precinct police station. Of course it took them a while to wake\nup, but one of the officers happened to notice the routine report on\nstolen cars in the area, and he decided to go across the street and\ncheck the license number on the car. Then something funny happened.\"\n\n\"Something funny?\" Malone asked. He doubted that, whatever it was, it\nwas going to make him laugh. But he kept his face a careful, receptive\nblank.\n\n\"That's right,\" Burris said. \"Now, if you're going to understand what\nhappened, you've got to get the whole picture.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Only that isn't what I mean,\" Burris added suddenly.\n\nMalone blinked. \"_What_ isn't what you mean?\" he said.\n\n\"Understanding what happened,\" Burris said. \"That's the trouble. You\nwon't understand what happened. I don't understand it and neither does\nanybody else. So what do you think about it?\"\n\n\"Think about what?\" Malone said.\n\n\"About what I've been telling you,\" Burris snapped. \"This car.\"\n\nMalone took a deep breath. \"Well,\" he said, \"this officer went over to\ncheck the license plate. It seems like the right thing to do. It's just\nwhat I'd have done myself.\"\n\n\"Sure you would,\" Burris said. \"Anybody would. But listen to me.\"\n\n\"All right, chief,\" Malone said.\n\n\"It was just after dawn--early in the morning.\" Malone wondered briefly\nif there were parts of the world where dawn came, say, late in the\nafternoon or during the evening some time, but he said nothing. \"The\nstreet was deserted,\" Burris went on. \"But it was pretty light out, and\nthe witnesses are willing to swear that there was nobody on that street\nfor a block in either direction. Except them, of course.\"\n\n\"Except who?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Except the witnesses,\" Burris said patiently. \"Four cops, police\nofficers who were standing on the front steps of the precinct station,\ntalking. They were waiting to go on duty, or anyhow that's what the\nreport said. It's lucky they were there, for whatever reason; they're\nthe only witnesses we've got.\"\n\nBurris stopped. Malone waited a few seconds and then said, as calmly as\nhe could: \"Witnesses to what?\"\n\n\"To this whole business with Sergeant Jukovsky,\" Burris said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sudden introduction of a completely new name confused Malone for an\ninstant, but he recovered gamely. \"Sergeant Jukovsky was the man who\ninvestigated the car,\" he said.\n\n\"That's right,\" Burris said. \"Except that he didn't.\"\n\nMalone sighed.\n\n\"Those four officers--the witnesses--they weren't paying much attention\nto what looked like the routine investigation of a parked car,\" Burris\nsaid. \"But here's their testimony. They were standing around talking\nwhen this Sergeant Jukovsky came out of the station, spoke to them in\npassing, and went on across the street. He didn't seem very worried or\nalarmed about anything.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Malone said involuntarily. \"I mean, go on, chief,\" he added.\n\n\"Ah,\" Burris said. \"All right. Well. According to Jukovsky, he took a\nlook at the plate and found the numbers checked the listing he had for a\nstolen Connecticut car. Then he walked around to take a look inside the\ncar. It was empty. Get that, Malone. The car was empty.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"it was parked. I suppose parked cars are usually\nempty. What's special about this one?\"\n\n\"Wait and see,\" Burris said ominously. \"Jukovsky swears the car was\nempty. He tried the doors, and they were all locked but one, the front\ndoor on the curb side, the driver's door. So he opened it, and leaned\nover to have a look at the odometer to check the mileage. And something\nclobbered him on the back of the head.\"\n\n\"One of the other cops,\" Malone said.\n\n\"One of the ... who?\" Burris said. \"No. Not the cops. Not at all.\"\n\n\"Then something fell on him,\" Malone said. \"O.K. Then whatever fell on\nhim ought to be--\"\n\n\"Malone,\" Burris said.\n\n\"Yes, chief?\"\n\n\"Jukovsky woke up on the sidewalk with the other cops all around him.\nThere was nothing on that sidewalk but Jukovsky. Nothing could have\nfallen on him; it hadn't landed anywhere, if you see what I mean.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"But--\"\n\n\"Whatever it was,\" Burris said, \"they didn't find it. But that isn't the\npeculiar thing.\"\n\n\"No?\"\n\n\"No,\" Burris said slowly. \"Now--\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Malone said. \"They looked on the sidewalk and around\nthere. But did they think to search the car?\"\n\n\"They didn't get a chance,\" Burris said. \"Anyhow, not just then. Not\nuntil they got around to picking up the pieces of the car uptown, at\n125th Street.\"\n\nMalone closed his eyes. \"Where was this precinct?\" he said.\n\n\"Midtown,\" Burris said. \"In the Forties.\"\n\n\"And the pieces of the car were eighty blocks away when they searched\nit?\" Malone said.\n\nBurris nodded.\n\n\"All right,\" Malone said pleasantly. \"I give up.\"\n\n\"Well, that's what I'm trying to tell you,\" Burris said. \"According to\nthe witnesses--not Jukovsky, who didn't wake up for a couple of minutes\nand so didn't see what happened next--after he fell out of the car, the\nmotor started and the car drove off uptown.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. He thought about that for a minute and decided at\nlast to hazard one little question. It sounded silly--but then, what\ndidn't? \"The car just drove off all by itself?\" he said.\n\nBurris seemed abashed. \"Well, Malone,\" he said carefully, \"that's where\nthe conflicting stories of the eyewitnesses don't agree. You see, two of\nthe cops say there was nobody in the car. Nobody at all. Of any kind.\nSmall or large.\"\n\n\"And the other two?\" Malone said.\n\n\"The other two swear they saw somebody at the wheel,\" Burris said, \"but\nthey won't say whether it was a man, a woman, a small child or an\nanthropoid ape--and they haven't the faintest idea where he, she or it\ncame from.\"\n\n\"Great,\" Malone said. He felt a little tired. This trip was beginning to\nsound less and less like a vacation.\n\n\"Those two cops swear there was something--or somebody--driving the\ncar,\" Burris said. \"And that isn't all.\"\n\n\"It isn't?\" Malone said.\n\nBurris shook his head. \"A couple of the cops jumped into a squad car and\nstarted following the red Cadillac. One of these cops saw somebody in\nthe car when it left the curb. The other one didn't. Got that?\"\n\n\"I've got it,\" Malone said, \"but I don't exactly know what to do with\nit.\"\n\n\"Just hold on to it,\" Burris said, \"and listen to this: the cops were\nabout two blocks behind at the start, and they couldn't close the gap\nright away. The Cadillac headed west and climbed up the ramp of the West\nSide Highway, heading north, out toward Westchester. I'd give a lot to\nknow where they were going, too.\"\n\n\"But they crashed,\" Malone said, remembering that the pieces were at\n125th Street. \"So--\"\n\n\"They didn't crash right away,\" Burris said. \"The prowl car started\ngaining on the Cadillac slowly. And--now, get this, Malone--both the\ncops swear there _was_ somebody in the driver's seat now.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Malone said. \"One of these cops didn't see anybody at\nall in the driver's seat when the car started off.\"\n\n\"Right,\" Burris said.\n\n\"But on the West Side Highway, he did see a driver,\" Malone said. He\nthought for a minute. \"It could happen. The start happened so fast he\ncould have been confused, or something.\"\n\n\"There's another explanation,\" Burris said.\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said cheerfully. \"We're all crazy. The whole world is\ncrazy.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Not that one,\" Burris said. \"I'll tell you when I finish with this\nthing about the car itself. There isn't much description of whoever or\nwhatever was driving that car on the West Side Highway, by the way. In\ncase you were thinking of asking.\"\n\nMalone, who hadn't been thinking of asking anything, tried to look\nclever. Burris regarded him owlishly for a second, and then went on:\n\n\"The car was hitting it up at about a hundred and ten by this time, and\naccelerating all the time. But the souped-up squad car was coming on\nfast, too, and it was quite a chase. Luckily, there weren't many cars on\nthe road. Somebody could have been killed, Malone.\"\n\n\"Like the driver of the Cadillac,\" Malone ventured.\n\nBurris looked pained. \"Not exactly,\" he said. \"Because the car hit the\n125th Street exit like a bomb. It swerved right, just as though it were\ngoing to take the exit and head off somewhere, but it was going much too\nfast by that time. There just wasn't any way to maneuver. The Cadillac\nhit the embankment, flipped over the edge, and smashed. It caught fire\nalmost at once--of course the prowl car braked fast and went down the\nexit, after it. But there wasn't anything to do.\"\n\n\"That's what I said,\" Malone said. \"The driver of the Cadillac was\nkilled. In a fire like that--\"\n\n\"Don't jump to conclusions, Malone,\" Burris said. \"Wait. When the prowl\ncar boys got to the scene, there was no sign of anybody in the car.\nNobody at all.\"\n\n\"In the heat of those flames--\" Malone began.\n\n\"Not enough heat, and not enough time,\" Burris said. \"A human body\ncouldn't have been destroyed in just a few minutes, not that completely.\nSome of the car's metal was melted, sure--but there would have been\ntraces of anybody who'd been in the car. Nice, big, easily-seen traces.\nAnd there weren't any. No corpse, no remains, no nothing.\"\n\nMalone let that stew in his mind for a few seconds. \"But the cops\nsaid--\"\n\n\"Whatever the cops said,\" Burris snapped, \"there was nobody at all in\nthat Cadillac when it went off the embankment.\"\n\n\"Now, wait a minute,\" Malone said. \"Here's a car with a driver who\nappears and disappears practically at will. Sometimes he's there and\nsometimes he's not there. It's not possible.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Ah,\" Burris said. \"That's why I have another explanation.\"\n\nMalone shifted his feet. Maybe there _was_ another explanation. But, he\ntold himself, it would have to be a good one.\n\n\"Nobody expects a car to drive itself down a highway,\" Burris said.\n\n\"That's right,\" Malone said. \"That's why it's all impossible.\"\n\n\"So,\" Burris said, \"it would be a natural hallucination--or illusion,\nanyhow--for somebody to imagine he did see a driver, when there wasn't\nany.\"\n\n\"O.K.,\" Malone said. \"There wasn't any driver. So the car couldn't have\ngone anywhere. So the New York police force is lying to us. It's a good\nexplanation, but it--\"\n\n\"They aren't lying,\" Burris said. \"Why should they? I'm thinking of\nsomething else.\" He stopped, his eyes bright as he leaned across the\ndesk toward Malone.\n\n\"Do I get three guesses?\" Malone said.\n\nBurris ignored him. \"Frankly,\" he said, \"I've got a hunch that the whole\nthing was done with remote control. Somewhere in that car was a very\ncleverly concealed device that was capable of running the Cadillac from\na distance.\"\n\nIt did sound plausible, Malone thought. \"Did the prowl car boys find\nany traces of it when they examined the wreckage?\" he said.\n\n\"Not a thing,\" Burris said. \"But, after all, it could have been melted.\nThe fire did destroy a lot of the Cadillac, and there's just no telling.\nBut I'd give long odds that there must have been some kind of robot\ndevice in that car. It's the only answer, isn't it?\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Malone,\" Burris said, his voice filled with Devotion To One's Country\nIn The Face Of Great Obstacles, \"Malone, I want you to find that\ndevice!\"\n\n\"In the wreck?\" Malone said.\n\nBurris sighed and leaned back. \"No,\" he said. \"Of course not. Not in the\nwreck. But the other red Cadillacs--some of them, anyhow--ought to\nhave--\"\n\n\"What red Cadillacs?\" Malone said.\n\n\"The other ones that have been stolen. From Connecticut, mostly. One\nfrom New Jersey, out near Passaic.\"\n\n\"Have any of the others been moving around without drivers?\" Malone\nsaid.\n\n\"Well,\" Burris said, \"there's been no report of it. But who can tell?\"\nHe gestured with both arms. \"Anything is possible, Malone.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Now,\" Burris said, \"all of the stolen cars are red 1972 Cadillacs.\nThere's got to be some reason for that--and I think they're covering up\nanother car like the one that got smashed: a remote--controlled\nCadillac. Or even a self-guiding, automatic, robot-controlled Cadillac.\"\n\n\"They?\" Malone said. \"Who?\"\n\n\"Whoever is stealing the cars,\" Burris said patiently.\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"Sure. But--\"\n\n\"So get up to New York,\" Burris said, \"keep your eyes open, and nose\naround. Got it?\"\n\n\"I have now,\" Malone said.\n\n\"And when that Cadillac is found, Malone, we want to take a look at it.\nO.K.?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Malone said.\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nOf course, there were written reports, too. Burris had handed Malone a\nsheaf of them--copies of the New York police reports to Burris\nhimself--and Malone, wanting some time to look through them, had taken a\ntrain to New York instead of a plane. Besides, the new planes still made\nhim slightly nervous, though he could ride one when he had to. If jet\nengines had been good enough for the last generation, he thought, they\nwere certainly good enough for him.\n\nBut avoidance of the new planes was all the good the train trip did him.\nThe reports contained thousands of words, none of which was either new\nor, apparently, significant to Malone. Burris, he considered, had given\nhim everything necessary for the job.\n\nExcept, of course, a way to make sense out of the whole thing. He\nconsidered robot-controlled Cadillacs. What good were they? They might\nmake it easier for the average driver, of course but that was no reason\nto cover up for them, hitting policemen over the head and smashing cars\nand driving a hundred and ten miles an hour on the West Side Highway.\n\nAll the same, it was the only explanation Malone had, and he cherished\nit deeply. He put the papers back in his brief case when the train\npulled into Penn Station, handed his suitcases to a redcap and punched\nthe 'cap's buttons for the waiting room. Now, he thought as he strolled\nslowly along behind the robot, there was an invention that made sense.\nAnd nobody had to get killed for it, or hit over the head or smashed up,\nhad they?\n\nSo what was all this nonsense about red robot-controlled Cadillacs?\n\nDriving these unwelcome reflections from his mind, he paused to light a\ncigarette. He had barely taken the first puff when a familiar voice\nsaid: \"Hey, buddy--hold the light, will you?\"\n\nMalone looked up, blinked and grinned happily. \"Boyd!\" he said. \"What\nare you doing here? I haven't seen you since--\"\n\n\"Sure haven't,\" Boyd said. \"I've been out west on a couple of cases.\nMust be a year since we worked together.\"\n\n\"Just about,\" Malone said. \"But what are you doing in New York?\nVacationing?\"\n\n\"Not exactly,\" Boyd said. \"The chief called it sort of a vacation,\nbut--\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"You're working with me.\"\n\nBoyd nodded. \"The chief sent me up. When I got back from the west, he\nsuddenly decided you might need a good assistant, so I took the plane\ndown, and got here ahead of you.\"\n\n\"Great,\" Malone said. \"But I want to warn you about the vacation--\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" Boyd said, just a shade sadly. \"I know. It isn't.\" He\nseemed deep in thought, as if he were deciding whether or not to get rid\nof Anne Boleyn. It was, Malone thought, an unusually apt simile. Boyd,\nsix feet tall and weighing about two hundred and twenty-five pounds, had\na large square face and a broad-beamed figure that might have made him a\ndead ringer for Henry VIII of England even without his Henry-like fringe\nof beard and his mustache. With them--thanks to the recent FBI rule that\nagents could wear \"facial hair, at the discretion of the director or\nsuch board as he may appoint\"--the resemblance to the Tudor monarch was\nuncanny.\n\nBut--like his famous double--Boyd didn't stay sad for long. \"I thought\nI'd meet you at the station,\" he said, cheering up, \"and maybe talk over\nold times for a while, on the way to the hotel, anyhow. So long as there\nwasn't anything else to do.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"It's good to see you again. And when did you get\npulled out of the Frisco office?\"\n\nBoyd grimaced. \"You know,\" he said, \"I had a good thing going for me out\nthere. Agent-in-Charge of the entire office. But right after that job we\ndid together--the Queen Elizabeth affair--Burris decided I was too good\na man to waste my fragrance on the desert air. Or whatever it is. So he\nrecalled me, assigned me from the home office, and I've been on one case\nafter another ever since.\"\n\n\"You're a home office agent now?\" Malone said.\n\n\"I'm a Roving Reporter,\" Boyd said, and struck a pose. \"I'm a General\nTrouble-shooter and a Mr. Fix-It. Just like you, Hero.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Malone said. \"How about the local office here? Seen the boys\nyet?\"\n\nBoyd shook his head. \"Not yet,\" he said. \"I was waiting for you to show\nup. But I did manage hotel rooms with a connecting bath over at the\nStatler-Hilton Hotel. Nice place. You'll like it, Ken.\"\n\n\"I'll love it,\" Malone said. \"Especially that connecting bath. It would\nhave been terrible to have an unconnecting bath. Sort of distracting.\"\n\n\"O.K.,\" Boyd said. \"O.K. You know what I mean.\" He stared down at\nMalone's hand. \"You know you've still got your lighter on?\" he added.\n\nMalone looked down at it and shut it off. \"You asked me to hold it,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"I didn't mean indefinitely,\" Boyd said. \"Anyhow, how about grabbing a\ncab and heading on down to the hotel to get your stuff away, before we\ncheck in at Sixty-ninth Street?\"\n\n\"Good idea,\" Malone said. \"And besides, I could do with a clean shirt.\nNot to mention a bath.\"\n\n\"Trains get worse and worse,\" Boyd said, absently.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMalone punched the redcap's buttons again, and he and Boyd followed it\nthrough the crowded station to the taxi stand. The robot piled the\nsuitcases into the cab, and somehow Malone and Boyd found room for\nthemselves.\n\n\"Statler-Hilton Hotel,\" Boyd said grandly.\n\nThe driver swung around to stare at them, blinked, and finally said:\n\"O.K., Mac. You said it.\" He started with a terrific grinding of gears,\ndrove out of the Penn Station arch and went two blocks.\n\n\"Here you are, Mac,\" he said, stopping the cab.\n\nMalone stared at Boyd with a reproachful expression.\n\n\"So how was I to know?\" Boyd said. \"I didn't know. If I'd known it was\nso close, we could've walked.\"\n\n\"And saved half a buck,\" Malone said. \"But don't let it bother you--this\nis expense account money.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Boyd said. He beamed and tipped the driver heavily. The\ncab drove off and Malone hailed the doorman, who equipped them with a\nrobot bellhop and sent them upstairs to their rooms.\n\nThree-quarters of an hour later, Boyd and Malone were in the offices of\nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation, on East Sixty-ninth Street. There,\nthey picked up a lot of nice, new, shiny facts. It was unfortunate, if\nnot particularly surprising, that the facts did not seem to make any\nsense.\n\nIn the first place, only red 1972 Cadillacs seemed to be involved.\nAnybody who owned such a car was likely to find it missing at any time;\nthere had been a lot of thefts reported, including some that hadn't had\ntime to get into Burris' reports. New Jersey now claimed two victims,\nand New York had three of its own.\n\nAnd all the cars weren't turning up in New York, by any means. Some of\nthe New York cars had turned up in New Jersey. Some had turned up in\nConnecticut--including one of the New Jersey cars. So far, there had\nbeen neither thefts nor discoveries from Pennsylvania, but Malone\ncouldn't see why.\n\nThere was absolutely no pattern that he, Boyd, or anyone else could\nfind. The list of thefts and recoveries had been fed into an electronic\ncalculator, which had neatly regurgitated them without being in the\nleast helpful. It had remarked that the square of seven was forty-nine,\nbut this was traced to a defect in the mechanism.\n\nWhoever was borrowing the red Caddies exhibited a peculiar combination\nof burglarious genius and what looked to Malone like outright idiocy.\nThis was plainly impossible.\n\nUnfortunately, it had happened.\n\nLocking the car doors didn't do a bit of good. The thief or thieves got\nin without so much as scratching the lock. This, obviously, proved that\nthe criminal was either an extremely good lock-pick or knew where to get\nduplicate keys.\n\nHowever, the ignition was invariably shorted across.\n\nThis proved neatly that the criminal was not a very good lock-pick, and\ndid not know where to get duplicate keys.\n\nQuery: why work so hard on the doors, and not work at all on the\nignition?\n\nThat was the first place. The second place was just what had been\nbothering Malone all along. There didn't seem to be any purpose to the\ncar thefts. They hadn't been sold, or used as getaway cars. True,\nteenage delinquents sometimes stole cars just to use them joyriding, or\nas some sort of prank.\n\nBut a car or two every night? How many joyrides can one gang take?\nMalone thought. And how long does it take to get tired of the same\nprank?\n\nAnd why, Malone asked himself wearily for what was beginning to feel\nlike the ten thousandth time, why only red Cadillacs?\n\nBurris, he told himself, must have been right all along. The red\nCadillacs were only a smoke screen for something else. Perhaps it was\nthe robot car, perhaps not--but whatever it was, Burris' general answer\nwas the only one that made any sense at all.\n\nThat should have been a comforting thought, Malone reflected. Somehow,\nthough it wasn't.\n\nAfter they'd finished with the files and personnel at Sixty-ninth\nStreet, Malone and Boyd started downtown on what turned out to be a sort\nof unguided tour of the New York Police Department. They spoke to some\nof the eyewitnesses, and ended up in Centre Street asking a lot of\nreasonably useless questions in the Motor Vehicle Bureau. In general,\nthey spent nearly six hours on the Affair of the Self-Propelled\nCadillac, picking up a whole bundle of facts. Some of the facts they had\nalready known. Some were new, but unhelpful.\n\nSomehow, nobody felt much like going out for a night on the town.\nInstead, both agents climbed wearily into bed thinking morose and\ndisillusioned thoughts.\n\nAnd, after that, a week passed. It was filled with ennui.\n\nOnly one thing became clear. In spite of the almost identical _modus\noperandi_, used in all the car thefts, they were obviously the work of a\ngang rather than a single person. This required the assumption that\nthere was not one insane man at work, but a crew of them, all\nidentically unbalanced.\n\n\"But the jobs are just too scattered to be the work of one man,\" Malone\nsaid. \"To steal a car in Connecticut and drive it to the Bronx, and then\nsteal another car in Westfield, New Jersey fifteen minutes later takes\nmore than talent. It takes an outright for-sure magician.\"\n\nThis conclusion, while interesting, was not really helpful. The fact was\nthat Malone needed more clues--or, anyhow, more facts--before he could\ndo anything at all. And there just weren't any new facts around. He\nspent the week wandering morosely from one place to another, sometimes\naccompanied by Thomas Boyd and sometimes all alone. Time, he knew, was\nticking by at its usual rate. But there wasn't a thing he could do about\nit.\n\nHe did try to relax and have some fun, as Burris had suggested. But he\ndidn't seem to be able to get his mind off the case.\n\nBoyd, after the first little while, had no such trouble. He entered the\nsocial life of the city with a whoop of joy and disappeared from sight.\nThat was fine for Boyd, Malone reflected, but it did leave Malone\nhimself just a little bit at loose ends.\n\nNot that he begrudged Boyd his fun. It was nice that one of them was\nenjoying himself, anyway.\n\nIt was just that Malone was beginning to get fidgety. He needed to be\ndoing something--even if it were only taking a walk.\n\nSo he took a walk, and ended up, to his own surprise, downtown near\nGreenwich Village.\n\nAnd then he'd been bopped on the head.\n\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\nThe patrol car pulled up in front of St. Vincent's Hospital and one of\nthe cops helped Malone into the Emergency Receiving Room. He didn't\nfeel as bad as he had a few minutes before. The motion of the car hadn't\nhelped any, but his head seemed to be knitting a little, and his legs\nwere a little steadier. True, he didn't feel one hundred per cent\nhealthy, but he was beginning to think he might live, after all. And\nwhile the doctor was bandaging his head a spirit of new life began to\nfill the FBI agent.\n\nHe was no longer morose and undirected. He had a purpose in life, and\nthat purpose filled him with cold determination. He was going to find\nthe robot-operated car--or whatever it turned out to be.\n\nThe doctor, Malone noticed, was whistling \"Greensleaves\" under his\nbreath as he worked. That, he supposed, was the influence of the\nbohemian folk singers of Greenwich Village. But he put the noise\nresolutely out of his mind and concentrated on the red Cadillac.\n\nIt was one thing to think about a robot car, miles away, doing something\nor other to somebody you'd never heard of before. That was just\ntheoretical, a case for solution, nothing but an ordinary job.\n\nBut when the car stepped up and bopped Malone himself on the head, it\nbecame a personal matter. Now Malone had more than a job to contend\nwith. Now he was thinking about revenge.\n\nHe told himself: _No car in the world--not even a Cadillac--can get away\nwith beaning Kenneth J. Malone!_\n\nMalone was not quite certain that he agreed with Burris' idea of a\nself-operating car, but at least it was something to work on. A car that\ncould reach out, crown an investigator and then drive off humming\nsomething innocent under its breath was certainly a unique and dangerous\nmachine within the meaning of the act. Of course, there were problems\nattendant on this view of things; for one thing, Malone couldn't quite\nsee how the car could have beaned him when he was ten feet away from it.\nBut that was, he told himself uncomfortably, a minor point. He could\ndeal with it when he felt a little better.\n\nThe important thing was the car itself. Malone jerked a little under the\ndoctors calm hands, and swore subvocally.\n\n\"Hold still,\" the doctor said. \"Don't go wiggling your head around that\nway. Just wait quietly until the demijel sets.\"\n\nObediently, Malone froze. There was a crick in his neck, but he decided\nhe could stand it. \"My head still hurts,\" he said accusingly.\n\n\"Sure it still hurts,\" the doctor agreed.\n\n\"But you--\"\n\n\"What did you expect?\" the doctor said. \"Even an FBI agent isn't immune\nto blackjacks, you know.\" He resumed his work on Malone's skull.\n\n\"Blackjacks?\" Malone said. \"What blackjacks?\"\n\n\"The ones that hit you,\" the doctor said. \"Or the one, anyhow.\"\n\nMalone blinked. Somehow, though he could manage a fuzzy picture of a\ncar reaching out to hit him, the introduction of a blackjack into this\nimaginative effort confused things a little. But he resolutely ignored\nit.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"The bruise is just the right size and shape,\" the doctor said. \"And\nthat cut on your head comes from the seams on the leather casing.\"\n\n\"You're sure?\" Malone said doubtfully. It did seem as if a car had a lot\nmore dangerous weapons around, without resorting to blackjacks. If it\nhad really wanted to damage him, why hadn't it hit him with the engine\nblock?\n\n\"I'm sure,\" the doctor said. \"I've worked in Emergency in this hospital\nlong enough to recognize a blackjack wound.\"\n\nThat was a disturbing idea, in a way. It gave a new color to Malone's\nreflection on Greenwich Villagers. Maybe things had changed since he'd\nheard about them. Maybe the blackjack had supplanted the guitar. But\nthat wasn't the important thing.\n\nThe fact that it had been a blackjack that had hit him was important. It\nwas vital, as a matter of fact. Malone knew that perfectly well. It was\na key fact in the case he was investigating.\n\nThe only trouble was that he didn't see what, if anything, it meant.\n\nThe doctor stepped back and regarded Malone's head with something like\npride. \"There,\" he said. \"You'll be all right now.\"\n\n\"When?\" Malone said.\n\n\"You're not badly hurt,\" the doctor said reprovingly. \"You've got a\nslight concussion, that's all.\"\n\n\"A concussion?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" the doctor said. \"But it isn't serious. Just take these\npills--one every two hours until they're gone--and you'll be rid of any\neffects within twenty-four hours.\" He went to a cabinet, fiddled around\nfor a minute and came back with a small bottle containing six orange\npills. They looked very large and threatening.\n\n\"Fine,\" Malone said doubtfully.\n\n\"You'll be all right,\" the doctor said, giving Malone a cheerful,\nconfident grin. \"Nothing at all to worry about.\" He loaded a hypojet and\nblasted something through the skin of Malone's upper arm. Malone\nswallowed hard. He knew perfectly well that he hadn't felt a thing, but\nhe couldn't quite make himself believe it.\n\n\"That'll take care of you for tonight,\" the doctor said. \"Get some sleep\nand start in on the pills when you wake up, O.K.?\"\n\n\"O.K.,\" Malone said. It was going to make waking up something less than\na pleasure, but he wanted to get well, didn't he?\n\nOf course he did. If that Cadillac thought it was going to beat him....\n\n\"You can stand up now,\" the doctor said.\n\n\"O.K.,\" Malone said, trying it. \"Thanks, doctor. I--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a knock at the door. The doctor jerked his head around.\n\n\"Who's that?\" he said.\n\n\"Me,\" a bass voice said, unhelpfully.\n\nThe Emergency Room door opened a crack and a face peered in. It took\nMalone a second to recognize Bill, the waffle-faced cop who had picked\nhim up next to the lamp post three years or so before. \"Long time no\nsee,\" Malone said at random.\n\n\"What?\" Bill said, and opened the door wider. He came in and closed it\nbehind him. \"It's O.K., Doc,\" he said to the attendant. \"I'm a cop.\"\n\n\"Been hurt?\" the doctor said.\n\nBill shook his head. \"Not recently,\" he said. \"I came to see this guy.\"\nHe looked at Malone. \"They told me you were still here,\" he said.\n\n\"Who's they?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Outside,\" Bill said. \"The attendants out there. They said you were\nstill getting stitched up.\"\n\n\"And quite right, too,\" Malone said solemnly.\n\n\"Oh,\" Bill said. \"Sure.\" He fished in his pockets. \"You dropped your\nnotebook, though, and I came to give it back to you.\" He located the\nobject he was hunting for and brought it out with the triumphant gesture\nof a man displaying the head of a dragon he has slain. \"Here,\" he said,\nwaving the book.\n\n\"Notebook?\" Malone said. He stared at it. It was a small looseleaf book\nbound in cheap black plastic.\n\n\"We found it in the gutter,\" Bill said.\n\nMalone took a tentative step forward and managed not to fall. He stepped\nback again and looked at Bill scornfully. \"I wasn't even in the gutter,\"\nhe said. \"There are limits.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Bill said. \"But the notebook was, so I brought it along to you.\nI thought you might need it or something.\" He handed it over to Malone\nwith a flourish.\n\nIt wasn't Malone's notebook. In the first place, he had never owned a\nnotebook that looked anything like that, and in the second place he\nhadn't had any notebooks on him when he went for his walk. _Mine not to\nquestion why_, Malone told himself with a shrug, and flipped the book\nopen.\n\nAt once he knew why the cop had mistaken it for his.\n\nThere, right on the first page, was a carefully detailed drawing of a\n1972 Cadillac. It had been painstakingly colored in with a red pencil.\n\nMalone stared at it for a second, and then went on to page two. This\npage carried a list of names running down the left margin.\n\n     _Ramon O.\n\n     Mario G.\n\n     Silvo E.\n\n     Felipe A.\n\n     Alvarez la B.\n\n     Juan de los S.\n\n     Ray del E._\n\nThat made sense, of a kind. It was a list of names. Whose names they\nwere, Malone didn't know; but at least he could see the list and\nunderstand it. What puzzled him were the decorations.\n\nFollowing each name was a queer-looking squiggle. Each was slightly\ndifferent, and each bore some resemblance to a stick-figure, a\ngeometrical figure or just a childish scrawl. The whole parade reminded\nMalone of pictures he had seen of Egyptian hieroglyphics.\n\nBut the names didn't look Egyptian, and, anyhow, nobody used\nhieroglyphics any more--did they?\n\nMalone found himself thinking: _Now what does that mean?_ He looked\nacross at the facing page.\n\nIt contained a set of figures, all marked off in dollars and cents and\nall added up neatly. One of the additions ended with the eye-popping sum\nof $52,710.09, and Malone found that the sum made him slightly nervous.\nThis was high-powered figuring.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn to page three, he told himself. Drawings again, both on that page and\non the one facing it. Malone recognized an outboard motor, a\nstore-front, a suit of clothing hanging neatly on a hanger, a motor\nscooter, a shotgun and an IBM Electrotyper. Whoever had done the work\nwas a reasonably accurate artist, if untrained; the various items were\neasily recognizable and Malone could see a great deal of detail.\n\nThat, of course, was fine. Only it made no more sense than the rest of\nthe notebook.\n\nMalone riffled through a few more pages, trying to make sense of the\ncontents. One page seemed to be a shopping list, with nothing more\nrevealing on it than _bread, bacon, eggs (1/2 doz.), peaches (frz.),\ncigs., & ltr., fluid_.\n\nThere was another list, farther on. This one said: _Hist. 2, Eng. 4,\nMath. 3, Span. 2. What for Elec.?_\n\nThat cast the first glow of light. Whoever owned the notebook was a\nstudent. Or a teacher, Malone thought; then, looking back at the\nhandwriting, he decided that the owner of the notebook had to be in high\nschool, certainly no farther along.\n\nHe went on flipping pages. One of them said, in large black capitals:\n=_HE'S BLUFFING!_=\n\nA note passed in class? There was not any way of making sure.\n\nMalone thought about the hypothetical student for a minute. Then\nsomething in the riffling pages caught his eye.\n\nThere were two names on the page he'd stopped at.\n\nThe first was: _Lt. Peter Lynch, NYPD._ It was followed by two little\nsquiggles.\n\nThe second was: _Mr. Kenneth J. Malone, FBI._\n\nThere were no squiggles after his own name, and Malone felt oddly\nthankful for that, without knowing exactly why. But what did the names\nmean? And who had--\n\n\"Uh ... Mr. Malone--\" Bill said tentatively. \"That _is_ your notebook,\nisn't it?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. He looked up at the cop and put on his most\ningratiating smile. \"Sure,\" he said. \"It's mine. Sure it is. Just\nchecking to see if I'd lost any pages. Not good. Losing pages out of a\nnotebook. Never. Have to check, you know. Procedure. Very secret.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Bill said uncertainly.\n\nMalone took a deep breath. \"Thought I'd lost the notebook,\" he said. \"I\nappreciate your returning it.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Bill said, \"that's O.K., Mr. Malone. Glad to do it.\"\n\n\"You don't know what this means to me,\" Malone said truthfully.\n\n\"No trouble at all,\" Bill said. \"Any time.\" He gave Malone a big smile\nand turned back to the door. \"But I got to get back to my beat,\" he\nsaid. \"Listen, I'll see you. And if I can be any help--\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"I'll let you know. And thanks again.\"\n\n\"Welcome,\" Bill said, and opened the door. He strode out with the air of\na man who has just been decorated with the Silver Star, the Purple Heart\nand the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n\nMalone tried a few more steps and discovered that he could walk without\nfalling down. He thanked the doctor again.\n\n\"Perfectly all right,\" the doctor said. \"Nothing to it. Why, you ought\nto see some of the cases we get here. There was a guy here the other\nnight with both his legs all mashed up by a--\"\n\n\"I'll bet,\" Malone said hurriedly. \"Well, I've got to be on my way. Just\nsend the bill to FBI Headquarters on Sixty-ninth Street.\" He closed the\ndoor on the doctor's enthusiastic: \"Yes, _sir_!\" and went on down the\nhallway and out into the street. At Seventh Avenue and Greenwich Avenue\nhe flagged a cab.\n\nWhat a place to be, Malone thought as the cab drove away. Where but in\nGreenwich Village did avenues intersect each other without so much as a\nby-your-leave?\n\n\"Statler-Hilton Hotel,\" he said, giving the whole thing up as a bad job.\nHe put his hat on his head and adjusted it painfully to the proper\nangle.\n\nAnd that, he thought, made another little problem. The car had not only\nhit him on the head; it had removed his hat before doing so, and then\nreplaced it. It had only fallen off when he'd started to get up against\nthe lamp post.\n\n_A nice quiet vacation_, Malone thought bitterly.\n\nHe fumed in silence all the way to the hotel, through the lobby, up in\nthe elevator and to the door of his room. Then he remembered the\nnotebook.\n\nThat was important evidence. He decided to tell Boyd about it right\naway.\n\nHe went into the bathroom and tapped gently on the door to Boyd's\nconnecting room. The door swung open.\n\nBoyd, apparently, was still out painting the town--Malone considered the\nword _red_ and dropped the whole phrase with a sigh. At any rate, his\npartner was nowhere in the room. He went back into his own room, closed\nthe door and got wearily ready for bed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDawn came, and then daylight, and then a lot more daylight. It was\nstreaming in through the windows with careless abandon, filling the room\nwith a lot of bright sunshine and the muggy heat of the city. From the\nstreet below, the cheerful noises of traffic and pedestrians floated up\nand filled Malone's ears.\n\nHe turned over in bed, and tried to go back to sleep.\n\nBut sleep wouldn't come. After a long time he gave up, and swung himself\nover the edge of the bed. Standing up was a delicate job, but he managed\nit, feeling rather proud of himself in a dim, semiconscious sort of way.\n\nHe went into the bathroom, brushed his teeth, and then opened the\nconnecting door to Boyd's room softly.\n\nBoyd was home. He lay in a great tangle of bedclothes, snoring hideously\nand making little motions with his hands and arms like a beached whale.\nMalone padded over to him and dug him fiercely in the ribs.\n\n\"Come on,\" he said. \"Wake up, Tommy-boy.\"\n\nBoyd's eyes did not open. In a voice as hollow as a zombie's, he said:\n\"My head. Hurts.\"\n\n\"Can't feel any worse than mine,\" Malone said cheerily. This, he\nreflected, was not quite true. Considering everything it had been\nthrough recently, his head felt remarkably like its old, carefree self.\n\"You'll feel better once you're awake.\"\n\n\"No, I won't,\" Boyd said simply. He jammed his head under a pillow and\nbegan to snore again. It was an awesome sound, like a man strangling to\ndeath in chicken-fat. Malone sighed and poked at random among the\nbedclothes.\n\nBoyd swore distantly, and Malone poked him again.\n\n\"The sun is up,\" Malone said, \"and all the little pedestrians are\nchirping. It is time to rise.\"\n\nBoyd said: \"Gah,\" and withdrew his head from the pillow. Gently, as if\nhe were afraid he were going to fall apart, he rose to a sitting\nposition. When he had arrived at it, he opened his eyes.\n\n\"Now,\" Malone said, \"isn't that better?\"\n\nBoyd closed his eyes again. \"No,\" he said.\n\n\"Come on,\" Malone said. \"We've got to be up and moving.\"\n\n\"I'm up,\" Boyd said. His eyes flickered open. \"But I can't move,\" he\nadded. \"We had quite a time last night.\"\n\n\"We?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Me, and a couple of girls, and another guy. Just people I met.\" Boyd\nstarted to stand up and thought better of it. \"Just having a good time,\nthat's all.\"\n\nMalone thought of reading his partner a lecture on the Evils of Drink,\nand decided against it. Boyd might remember it, and use it against him\nsome time. Then he realized what had to be done. He went back into his\nown room, dialed for room service, and ordered a couple of pots of\nstrong black coffee.\n\nBy the time a good deal of that was awash in Boyd's intestinal system,\nhe was almost capable of rational, connected conversation. He filled\nhimself to the eyebrows with aspirins and other remedies, and actually\nsucceeded in getting dressed. He seemed quite proud of this feat.\n\n\"O.K.,\" Malone said. \"Now we have to go downstairs.\"\n\n\"You mean outside?\" Boyd said. \"Into all that noise?\" He winced.\n\n\"Bite the bullet,\" Malone said cheerfully. \"Keep a stiff upper lip.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" Boyd said, hunting for his coat with a doleful air. \"Have\nyou ever seen anybody with a loose upper lip?\"\n\nMalone, busy with his own coat, didn't bother with a reply. He managed\nsomehow to get Boyd downstairs and bundled into a cab. They headed for\nSixty-ninth Street.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere, he made several phone calls. The first, of course, was to Burris\nin Washington. After that he got the New York Police Commissioner on the\nwire and, finding that he needed still more authority, he called the\nMayor and then, by long-distance to Albany, the Governor.\n\nBut by noon he had everything straightened out. He had a plan fully\nworked out in his mind, and he had the authority to go ahead with it.\nNow, he could make his final call.\n\n\"They're completely trustworthy,\" Burris had told him. \"Not only that,\nbut they have a clearance for this kind of special work--we've needed\nthem before.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Not only that,\" Burris told him. \"They're good men. Maybe among the\nbest in their field.\"\n\nSo Malone made his last call, to the firm of Leibowitz & Hardin,\nElectronic Engineers.\n\nThen he beckoned to Boyd.\n\n\"I don't see what I've been sitting around here for, all this time,\" his\npartner complained. \"I could have been home sleeping until you needed\nme. And--\"\n\n\"I need you now,\" Malone said. \"I want you to take over part of this\nplan.\"\n\nBoyd nodded sourly. \"Oh, all right,\" he said.\n\n\"Here's what I want,\" Malone said. \"Every red 1972 Cadillac in the area\nis to be picked up for inspection. I don't care why--make up a reason. A\ngeneral traffic check. Anything you please. You can work that end of it\nout with the Commissioner; he knows about it and he's willing to go\nalong.\"\n\n\"Great,\" Boyd said. \"Do you have any idea how many cars there are in a\ncity this size?\"\n\n\"Well, we don't want all of them,\" Malone said. \"Only red 1972\nCadillacs.\"\n\n\"It's still a lot,\" Boyd said.\n\n\"If there were only three,\" Malone said, \"we wouldn't have any\nproblems.\"\n\n\"And wouldn't that be nice?\" Boyd said.\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said, \"but it isn't true. Anyhow: I want every one of\nthose cars checked for any oddity, no matter how small. If there's an\ninch-long scratch on one fender, I want to know about it. If you've got\nto take the cars apart, then do that.\"\n\n\"Me?\" Boyd said. \"All by myself?\"\n\n\"No,\" Malone said. \"Use your head. There'll be a team working with you.\nLet me explain it. Every nut, every bolt, every inch of those cars has\nto be examined thoroughly--got it?\"\n\n\"I've got it,\" Boyd said, \"but I don't like it. After all, Malone--\"\n\nMalone ignored him. \"The Governor of New York promised his\nco-operation,\" he said, \"and he said he'd get in touch with the\nGovernors of New Jersey and Connecticut and get co-operation from that\nangle. So we'll have state and local police working with us.\"\n\n\"That's a help,\" Boyd said. \"We'll make such a happy team of workmen.\nSinging as we pull the cars apart through the long day and night and ...\nlisten, Malone, when do you want reports on this?\"\n\n\"Yesterday,\" Malone said.\n\nBoyd's eyebrows raised, then lowered. \"Great,\" he said dully.\n\n\"I don't care how you get the cars,\" Malone said. \"If you've got to,\ncondemn 'em. But get every last one of them. And bring them over to\nLeibowitz & Hardin for a complete checkup. I'll give you the address.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Boyd said.\n\n\"Not at all,\" Malone said. \"Glad to be of help. And don't worry; I'll\nhave other work to do.\" He paused, and then went on: \"I talked to Dr.\nIsaac Leibowitz, he's the head of the firm out there--and he says....\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Boyd said.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You mean I don't have to take the cars apart myself? You mean this\nLeibowitz & Hardin, or whatever it is, will do it for me?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Malone said wearily. \"You re not an auto technician or an\nelectronics man. You're an agent of the FBI.\"\n\n\"I was beginning to wonder,\" Boyd said. \"After all.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Anyhow,\" Malone said doggedly, \"I talked to Leibowitz, and he says he\ncan give a car a complete check in about six hours, normally.\"\n\n\"Six hours?\" Boyd stared. \"That's going to take forever,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, he can set up a kind of assembly-line process and turn out a car\nevery fifteen minutes. Any better?\"\n\nBoyd nodded.\n\n\"Good,\" Malone said. \"There can't be so many 1972 red Cadillacs in the\narea that we can't get through them all at that speed.\" He thought a\nminute and then added: \"By the way, you might check with the Cadillac\ndealers around town, and find out just how many there are, sold to\npeople living in the area.\"\n\n\"And while I'm doing all that,\" Boyd said, \"what are you going to be\ndoing?\"\n\nMalone looked at him and sighed. \"I'll worry about that,\" he said. \"Just\nget started.\"\n\n\"Suppose Leibowitz can't find anything?\" Boyd said.\n\n\"If Leibowitz can't find it, it's not there,\" Malone said. \"He can find\nelectronic devices anywhere in any car made, he says--even if they're\nprinted circuits hidden under the paint job.\"\n\n\"Pretty good,\" Boyd said. \"But suppose he doesn't?\"\n\n\"Then they aren't there,\" Malone said, \"and we'll have to think of\nsomething else.\" He considered that. It sounded fine. Only he wished he\nknew what else there was to think of.\n\nWell, that was just pessimism. Leibowitz would find something, and the\ncase would be over, and he could go back to Washington and rest. In\nAugust he was going to have his vacation, anyway, and August wasn't very\nfar away.\n\nMalone put a smile carefully on his face and told Boyd: \"Get going.\" He\nslammed his hat on his head.\n\nWincing, he took it off and replaced it gently. The bottle of pills was\nstill in his pocket, but he wasn't due for another one just yet.\n\nHe had time to go over to the precinct station in the West Eighties\nfirst.\n\nHe headed outside to get another taxi.\n\n\n\n\nV.\n\n\nThe door didn't say anything at all except \"Lt. P. Lynch.\" Malone looked\nat it for a couple of seconds. He'd asked the Desk Sergeant for Lynch,\nshown his credentials and been directed up a set of stairs and around a\nhall. But he still didn't know what Lynch did, who he was, or what his\nname was doing in the little black notebook.\n\nWell, he told himself, there was only one way to find out.\n\nHe opened the door.\n\nThe room was small and dark. It had a single desk in it, and three\nchairs, and a hatrack. There wasn't any coat or hat on the hatrack, and\nthere was nobody in the chairs. In a fourth chair, behind the desk, a\nhuskily-built man sat. He had steel-gray hair, a hard jaw and, Malone\nnoticed with surprise, a faint twinkle in his eye.\n\n\"Lieutenant Lynch?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Right,\" Lynch said. \"What's the trouble?\"\n\n\"I'm Kenneth J. Malone,\" Malone said. \"FBI.\" He reached for his wallet\nand found it. He flipped it open for Lynch, who stared at it for what\nseemed a long, long time and then burst into laughter.\n\n\"What's so funny?\" Malone asked.\n\nLynch laughed some more.\n\n\"Oh, come on,\" Malone said bitterly. \"After all, there's no reason to\ntreat an FBI agent like some kind of a--\"\n\n\"FBI agent?\" Lynch said. \"Listen, buster, this is the funniest gag I've\nseen since I came on the Force. Who told you to pull it? Jablonski\ndownstairs? Or one of the boys on the beat? I know those beat patrolmen,\nalways on the lookout for a new joke. But this tops 'em all. This is\nthe--\"\n\n\"You're a disgrace to the Irish,\" Malone said tartly.\n\n\"A what?\" Lynch said. \"I'm not Irish.\"\n\n\"You talk like an Irishman,\" Malone said.\n\n\"I know it,\" Lynch said, and shrugged. \"Around some precincts, you sort\nof pick it up. When all the other cops are ... hey, listen. How'd we get\nto talking about me?\"\n\n\"I said you were a disgrace to the Irish,\" Malone said.\n\n\"I was a--what?\"\n\n\"Disgrace.\" Malone looked carefully at Lynch. In a fight, he considered,\nhe might get in a lucky punch that would kill Malone. Otherwise, Malone\ndidn't have a thing to worry about except a few months of\nhospitalization.\n\nLynch looked as if he were about to get mad, and then he looked down at\nMalone's wallet again and started to laugh.\n\n\"What's so funny?\" Malone demanded.\n\nHe grabbed the wallet and turned it toward him. At once, of course, he\nrealized what had happened. He had not flipped it open to his badge at\nall. He'd flipped it open, instead, to a card in the card-case:\n\n     KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE\n     PRESENTS THAT Sir Kenneth\n     Malone, Knight, is hereby formally\n     installed with the title of\n     KNIGHT OF THE BATH\n     and this card shall signify his right\n     to that title and his high and respected\n     position as officer in and of\n     THE QUEENS OWN F.B.I.\n\nIn a very small voice, Malone said: \"There's been a terrible mistake.\"\n\n\"Mistake?\" Lynch said.\n\nMalone flipped the wallet open to his FBI shield. Lynch gave it a good\nlong examination, peering at it from every angle and holding it up to\nthe light two or three times. He even wet his thumb and rubbed at the\nbadge with it. At last he looked up.\n\n\"I guess you are the FBI,\" he said. \"But what was with the gag?\"\n\n\"It wasn't a gag,\" Malone said. \"It's just--\" He thought of the little\nold lady in Yucca Flats, the little old lady who had been the prime\nmover in the last case he and Boyd had worked on together. Without the\nlittle old lady, the case might never have been solved--she was an\nauthentic telepath, about the best that had ever been found.\n\nBut with her, Boyd and Malone had had enough troubles. Besides being a\ntelepath, she was quite thoroughly insane. She had one fixed delusion:\nshe believed she was Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nShe was still at Yucca Flats, along with the other telepaths Malone's\ninvestigation had turned up. And she still believed, quite calmly, that\nshe was Good Queen Bess. Malone had been knighted by her during the\ncourse of the investigation. This new honor had come to him through the\nmail; apparently she had decided to ennoble some of her friends still\nfurther.\n\nMalone made a note mentally to ask Boyd if he'd received one. After all,\nthere couldn't be too many Knights of the Bath. There was no sense in\nletting _everybody_ in.\n\nThen he realized that he was beginning to believe everything again.\nThere had been times, when he'd been working with the little old lady,\nwhen he had been firmly convinced that he was, in fact, the swaggering,\nruthless swordsman, Sir Kenneth Malone. And even now....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Well?\" Lynch said.\n\n\"It's too long a story,\" Malone said. \"And besides, it's not what I came\nhere about.\"\n\nLynch shrugged again. \"O.K.,\" he said. \"Tell it your way.\"\n\n\"First,\" Malone said, \"what's your job?\"\n\n\"Me? Precinct Lieutenant.\"\n\n\"Of this precinct?\"\n\nLynch stared. \"What else?\" he said.\n\n\"Who knows?\" Malone said. He found the black notebook and passed it\nacross to Lynch. \"I'm on this red Cadillac business, you know,\" he said\nby way of introduction.\n\n\"I've been hearing about it,\" Lynch said. He picked up the notebook\nwithout opening it and held it like a ticking bomb. \"And I mean hearing\nabout it,\" he said. \"We haven't had any trouble at all in this\nprecinct.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Malone said. \"I've read the reports.\"\n\n\"Listen, not a single red Cadillac has been stolen from here, or been\nreported found here. We run a tight precinct here, and let me tell\nyou--\"\n\n\"I'm sure you do a fine job,\" Malone said hastily. \"But I want you to\nlook at the notebook.\" He opened it to the page with Lynch's name on it.\n\nLynch opened his mouth, closed it and then took the notebook. He stared\nat the page for a few seconds. \"What's this?\" he said at last. \"Another\ngag?\"\n\n\"No gag, lieutenant,\" Malone said.\n\n\"It's your name and mine,\" Lynch said. \"What is that supposed to mean?\"\n\nMalone shrugged. \"Search me,\" he said. \"The notebook was found only a\ncouple of feet away from another car theft, last night.\" That was the\nsimplest way he could think of to put it. \"So I asked the Commissioner\nwho Peter Lynch was, and he told me it was you.\"\n\n\"And it is,\" Lynch said, staring at the notebook. He seemed to be\nexpecting it to rise and strike him.\n\nMalone said: \"Have you got any idea who'd be writing about you and me?\"\n\nLynch shook his head. \"If I had any ideas I'd feel a lot better,\" he\nsaid. He wet his finger and turned the notebook pages carefully. When he\nsaw the list of names on the second page he stopped again, and stared.\nThis time he whistled under his breath.\n\nVery cautiously, Malone said: \"Something?\"\n\n\"I'll be damned,\" Lynch said feelingly.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Malone said.\n\nThe police lieutenant looked up. \"I don't know if it's wrong or what,\"\nhe said. \"It gives me sort of the willies. I know every one of these\nkids.\"\n\nMalone took out a pill and swallowed it in a hurry. He felt exactly as\nif he had been given another concussion, absolutely free and without any\nobligation. His mouth opened but nothing came out for a long time. At\nlast he managed to say: \"_Kids?_\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Lynch said. \"What did you think?\"\n\nMalone shrugged helplessly.\n\n\"Every single one of them,\" Lynch said. \"Right from around here.\"\n\nThere was a little silence.\n\n\"Who are they?\" Malone said carefully.\n\n\"They're some kind of kid gang, social club, something like that,\" Lynch\nsaid. \"They call themselves the Silent Spooks.\"\n\n\"The what?\" It seemed to Malone that the name was just a little fancy,\neven for a kid gang.\n\n\"The Silent Spooks,\" Lynch said. \"I can't help it. But here they are:\nRamon Otravez, Mario Grito, Silvo Envoz, Felipe Altapor, Alvarez la\nBarba, Juan de los Santos and Ray del Este. Right down the line.\" He\nlooked up from the notebook with a blank expression on his face.\n\"There's only one name missing, as a matter of fact. Funny it isn't\nthere.\"\n\nMalone tried to look as if he knew what was going on. \"Oh?\" he said.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Lynch said. \"The Fueyo kid--Miguel Fueyo. Everybody calls him\nMike.\"\n\nWhile interesting, this did not provide much food for thought. \"Why\nshould his name be on it especially?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Because he's the leader of the gang,\" Lynch said. \"The boss. The big\nshot.\" He pointed to the list of names. \"Except for him, that's all of\nthem--the Silent Spooks.\"\n\nMalone considered the missing Mike Fueyo.\n\nHe knew perfectly well, now, why Fueyo's name was not in the book.\n\nWho puts his own name on a list?\n\nThe notebook was Fueyo's. It had to be.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLynch was looking at him expectantly. Malone thought of a question and\nasked it. \"They know you?\" he said.\n\n\"Sure they do,\" Lynch said. \"They all know me. But do they know you?\"\n\nMalone thought. \"They could have heard of me,\" he said at last, trying\nto be as modest as possible.\n\n\"I guess,\" Lynch said grudgingly.\n\n\"How old are they?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Fourteen to seventeen,\" Lynch said. \"Somewhere in there. You know how\nthese kid things run.\"\n\n\"The Silent Spooks,\" Malone said meditatively. It was a nice name, in a\nway; you just had to get used to it for a while. When he had been a kid,\nhe'd belonged to a group that called itself the East Division Street\nKids. There just wasn't much romance in a name like that. Now, the\nSilent Spooks--\n\nWith a wrench, he brought his mind back to the subject at hand. \"Do they\nget into much trouble?\" he said.\n\n\"Well, no,\" Lynch said reluctantly. \"As a matter of fact, they don't.\nFor a bunch like that, around here, they're pretty well-behaved, as far\nas that goes.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Malone said.\n\nLynch's face took on a delicately unconcerned appearance. \"I don't\nknow,\" he said. \"They just don't get into neighborhood trouble. Maybe a\nscrap now and then--nothing big, though. Or maybe one of them cuts a\nclass at school or argues with his teacher. But there's nothing unusual,\nand little of anything.\" He frowned.\n\nMalone said: \"Something's got to be wrong. What is it?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Lynch said, \"they do seem to have a lot of money to spend.\"\n\nMalone sat down in a chair across the desk, and leaned eagerly toward\nLynch. \"Money?\" he said.\n\n\"Money,\" Lynch said. \"New clothes. Cigarettes. Malone, three of them are\neven supporting their parents. Old Jose Otravez--Ramon's old man--quit\nhis job a couple of months ago, and hasn't worked since. Spends all his\ntime in bars, and never runs out of dough--and don't tell me you can do\nthat on Unemployment Insurance. Or Social Security payments.\"\n\n\"O.K.,\" Malone said. \"I won't tell you.\"\n\n\"And there's others. All the others, in fact. Mike Fueyo's\nsister--dresses fit to kill, like a high-fashion model. And the Grito\nkid--\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Malone said. \"From what you tell me, this isn't just a\nlittle extra money. These kids must be rolling in the stuff. Up to their\nears in dough.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" Lynch said sadly. \"Those kids spend more than I do. They do\nbetter than that--they spend more than I _earn_.\" He looked remotely\nsorry for himself, but not for long. \"Every one of those kids spends\nlike a drunken sailor, tossing his money away on all sorts of things.\"\n\n\"Like an expense account,\" Malone said idly. Lynch looked up. \"Sorry,\"\nMalone said. \"I was thinking about something else.\"\n\n\"I'll bet you were,\" Lynch said with unconcealed envy.\n\n\"No,\" Malone said. \"Really. Listen, I'll check with Internal Revenue on\nthat money. But have you got a list of the kids' addresses?\"\n\n\"I can get one,\" Lynch said, and went to the door.\n\nIt closed behind him. Malone sat waiting alone for a few minutes, and\nthen Lynch came back. \"List'll be here in a minute,\" he said. He sat\ndown behind his desk and reached for the notebook again. When he turned\nto the third page his expression changed to one of surprise.\n\n\"Be damned,\" said. \"There does seem to be a connection, doesn't there?\"\nHe held up the picture of the red Cadillac for Malone to see.\n\n\"Sure does,\" Malone said. \"That's why I want those addresses. If there\nis a connection, I sure want to find out about it.\"\n\nTen minutes later, Malone was walking out of the precinct station with\nthe list of addresses in his pocket. He was heading for his Great\nAdventure, but he didn't know it. All he was thinking about was the red\nCadillacs, and the eight teen-agers. \"I'm going to get to the bottom of\nthis if it takes me all summer,\" he said, muttering to himself.\n\n\"That's the spirit,\" he told himself. \"Never say die.\"\n\nThen, realizing he had just said it, he frowned. Perhaps it hadn't\nreally counted. But, then again....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was on his way down the steps when he hit the girl.\n\nThe mutual collision was not catastrophic. On the other hand, it was not\nexactly minor. It fell somewhere between the two, as an unclassifiable\nphenomenon of undoubted potency. Malone said: \"Oog,\" with some fervor as\nthe girl collided with his chest and rebounded like a handball striking\na wall. Something was happening to her, but Malone had no time to spare\nto notice just what. He was falling through space, touching a concrete\nstep once in a while, but not long enough to make any real acquaintance\nwith it. It seemed to take him a long time to touch bottom, and when he\nhad, he wondered if _touch_ was quite the word.\n\n_Bottom_ certainly was. He had fallen backward and landed directly on\nhis _glutei maximi_, obeying the law regarding equal and opposite\nreaction and several other laws involving falling bodies.\n\nHis first thought was that he was now neatly balanced. His tail had\nreceived the same treatment as his head. He wondered if a person could\nget concussion of the tail bones, and had reached no definite conclusion\nwhen, unexpectedly, his eyes focused again.\n\nHe was looking at a girl. That was all he saw at first. She had\napparently fallen just as he had, bounced once and sat down rather hard.\nShe was now lying flat on her back, making a sound like \"_rrr_\" between\nher teeth.\n\nMalone discovered that he was sitting undignifiedly on the steps. He\nopened his mouth to say something objectionable, took another look at\nthe girl, and shut it with a snap. This was no ordinary girl.\n\nHe smiled at her. She shook her head and sat up, still going \"_rrr_.\"\nThen she stopped and said, instead: \"What do you think--\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Malone said in what he hoped was a charming, debonair and\napologetic voice. It was quite a lot to get into one voice, but he tried\nhis very hardest. \"I just didn't see--\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"You didn't?\" the girl said. \"If you didn't, you must be completely\nblind.\"\n\nMalone noticed with hope that there was no anger in her voice. The last\nthing in the world he wanted was to get this girl angry at him.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" Malone said. \"I'm not blind. Not blind at all.\" He smiled at\nher and stood up. His face was beginning to get a little tired, but he\nretained the smile as he went over to her, extended a hand and pulled\nher to her feet.\n\nShe was something special. Her hair was long and dark, and fell in soft\nwaves to her shoulders. The shoulders were something all by themselves,\nbut Malone postponed consideration of them for a minute to take a look\nat her face.\n\nIt was heart-shaped and rather thin. She had large brown liquid eyes\nthat could look, Malone imagined, appealing, loving, worshiping--or,\nlike a minute ago, downright furious. Below these features, she had a\nstraight lovely nose and a pair of lips which Malone immediately\nclassified as Kissable.\n\nHer figure, including the shoulders, was on the slim side, but she was\nvery definitely all there. Malone could not think of any parts the\nCreator had left out, and if there were any he didn't want to hear about\nthem. In an instant, Malone knew that he had met the only great love of\nhis life.\n\nAgain.\n\nHis mind was whirling and for a second he didn't know what to do. And\nthen he remembered the Queen's Own FBI. Phrases flowered forth in his\nmind as if it were a garden packed corner to corner with the most\nexquisite varieties of blooming idiots.\n\n\"My deepest apologies, my dear,\" Sir Kenneth Malone said gallantly, even\nmanaging a small display bow for the occasion. \"May I be of any\nassistance?\"\n\nThe girl smiled up at him as she came to her feet. The smile was radiant\nand beautiful and almost loving. Malone felt as if he couldn't stand it.\nTingles of the most wonderful kind ran through him, reached his toes and\nthen ran back the other way, meeting a whole new set going forward.\n\n\"You're very nice,\" the girl said, and the tingles became positive waves\nof sensation. \"Actually, it was all my fault. Please don't apologize,\nMr.--\" She paused, expectantly.\n\n\"Me?\" Malone said, his gallantry deserting him for the second. But it\nreturned full force before he expected it. \"I'm Malone,\" he said.\n\"Kenneth Joseph Malone.\" He had always liked the middle name he had\ninherited from his father, but he never had much opportunity to use it.\nHe made the most of it now, rolling it out with all sorts of subsidiary\nflourishes. As a matter of fact, he barely restrained himself from\nputting a \"Sir\" before his name.\n\nThe girl's brown eyes widened just a trifle. Malone felt as if he could\nhave fallen into them and drowned. \"Oh, my,\" she said. \"You must be a\ndetective.\" And then, like the merest afterthought: \"My name's Dorothy.\"\n\n_Dorothy._ It was a beautiful name. It made Malone feel all choked up,\ninside. He blinked at the girl and tried to look manly and wonderful. It\nwas an effort, but he nearly carried it off.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter a second or two he realized that she had asked him a question. He\ndidn't want to disillusion her in any way, and, after all, an FBI agent\nwas a kind of detective, but he thought it was only fair that she should\nknow the whole truth about him right from the start.\n\n\"Not exactly a detective,\" he said.\n\n\"Not exactly?\" she said, looking puzzled. She looked positively glorious\nwhen puzzled, Malone decided at once.\n\n\"That is,\" he said carefully, \"I do detect, but not for the city of New\nYork.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she said. \"A private eye. Is that right?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"no.\"\n\nShe looked even more puzzled. Malone hastened to explain before he got\nto the point where conversation was impossible.\n\n\"Federal Bureau of Investigation,\" he said. After a second he thought\nof a clarification and added: \"FBI.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" the girl said. \"_Oh._\"\n\n\"But you can call me Ken,\" Malone said.\n\n\"All right--Ken,\" she said. \"And you call me Dorothy.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" he said. He tried it out. \"Dorothy.\" It felt swell.\n\n\"Well--\" she said after a second.\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"Were you looking for a detective? Because if I can\nhelp in any way--\"\n\n\"Not exactly,\" Dorothy said. \"Just a little routine business. I'll go on\nin and--\"\n\nMalone suddenly found himself talking without having any idea why he'd\nstarted, or what he was going to say. At first he said: \"_Urr_,\" as if\nthe machine were warming up, and this stopped Dorothy and caused her to\ngive him a rather sharp, baffled stare. Then he found some words and\nused them hurriedly, before they got away.\n\n\"Dorothy,\" he said, \"would you like to take in a show this evening? I\nthink I can get tickets to ... well, I guess I could get tickets to\nalmost anything, if I really tried.\" His expression attempted to leave\nno doubt that he would really try.\n\nDorothy appeared to consider for a moment. \"Well,\" she said at last,\n\"how about 'The Hot Seat'?\"\n\nMalone felt just the way he had several years before when he had bluffed\nhis way into a gigantic pot during a Washington poker game, with only a\npair of fours to work with. At the last moment, his bluff had been\ncalled.\n\nIt had, he realized, been called again. \"The Hot Seat\" had set some sort\nof record, not only for Broadway longevity, but for audience frenzy.\nGetting tickets for it was about the same kind of proposition as buying\ngrass on the Moon, and getting them with absolutely no prior notice\nwould require all the wire-pulling Malone could manage. He thought about\n\"The Hot Seat\" and wished Dorothy had picked something easy, like\narranging for her to meet the Senate.\n\nBut he swallowed bravely. \"I'll do my best,\" he said. \"Got any second\nchoice?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" she said, and laughed. \"Pick any one you want. I haven't seen\nthem all, and the ones I have seen are worth seeing again.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said.\n\n\"I really didn't expect you to get tickets for 'The Hot Seat,'\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"Nothing,\" Malone said, \"is impossible.\" He grinned at her. \"Meanwhile,\nwhere can I pick you up? Your home?\"\n\nDorothy frowned and shook her head. \"No,\" she said. \"You see, I'm living\nwith an aunt, and I ... well, never mind.\" She thought for a minute. \"I\nknow,\" she said. \"Topp's.\"\n\n\"What?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Topp's,\" Dorothy said. \"On Forty-second Street, just East of Broadway?\nIt's a restaurant.\"\n\n\"I don't exactly know where it is,\" Malone said, \"but if it's there,\nI'll find it.\" He looked gallant and determined. \"We can get something\nto eat there before the show--whatever the show turns out to be.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Dorothy said.\n\n\"How about making it at six?\" Malone said.\n\nShe nodded. \"Six it is,\" she said. \"Now bye-bye.\" She touched her\nforefinger to her lips, and brushed Malone's cheek with the kissed\nfinger.\n\nBy the time the new set of tingles had begun to evaporate, she had gone\ninto the police station. Malone heaved a great sigh of passion, and held\ndown a strong impulse to follow her and protect her. He wasn't quite\nsure what he was going to protect her from, but he felt certain that\nthat would come to him when the time arrived.\n\nNevertheless, he had work to do, unpleasant as the idea had suddenly\nbegun to seem. He pulled the list of addresses out of his pocket and\nlooked at the first one.\n\n_Mike Fueyo._\n\nMike was the leader of the Silent Spooks, according to Lieutenant Lynch.\nLogically, therefore, he would be the first one to talk to. Malone tried\nto think of some good questions, but the best one he could come up with\nwas: \"Well, what about all those red Cadillacs?\"\n\nSomehow he doubted that this would provide a satisfactory reply. He\nchecked the address again and started firmly down the street, trying to\nthink of some better questions along the way.\n\n\n\n\nVI.\n\n\nThe building was just off Amsterdam, in the Eighties. It had been a\nshining new development once, but it was beginning to slide downhill\nnow. The metal on the windowframes was beginning to look worn, and the\nbrickwork hadn't been cleaned in a long time. Where chain fences had\nonce protected lonely blades of grass, children, mothers and baby\ncarriages held sway now, and the grass was gone. Instead, the building\nwas pretty well surrounded by a moat of sick-looking brown dirt.\n\nMalone went into the first building and checked the name against the\nmailboxes there, trying to ignore the combined smells of sour milk, red\npepper and here and there a whiff of unwashed humanity.\n\nIt was on the tenth floor: _Fueyo, J._ That, he supposed, would be\nMike's widowed mother; Lynch had told him that much about the boy and\nhis family. He found the elevator, which was covered with scribbles\nranging from JANEY LOVES MIGUEL to startling obscenities, and rode it\nupstairs.\n\nApartment 1004 looked like every other apartment in the building, at\nleast from the outside. Malone pressed the button and waited a second to\nhear the faint buzzing at the other side of the door. After a minute, he\npressed it again.\n\nThe door swung open very suddenly and Malone stepped back.\n\nA short, wrinkled, dark-eyed woman in a print housedress was eying him\nwith deep suspicion. \"My daughter is not home,\" she announced at once.\n\n\"I'm not looking for your daughter,\" Malone said. \"I'd like to talk to\nMike.\"\n\n\"Mike?\" Her expression grew even more suspicious. \"You want to talk to\nMike?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Ah,\" the woman said. \"You one of those hoodlum friends he has. I'm\nright? You can talk to Mike when I am dead and have no control over him.\nFor now, you can just--\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Malone said. He pulled out his wallet and flipped it\nopen to show his badge, being very careful that he made the right flip\nthis time. He didn't know exactly how this woman would react to The\nQueen's Own FBI, but he didn't especially want to find out.\n\nShe looked down at the badge without taking the wallet from him. \"Hah,\"\nshe said. \"You're cop, eh?\" Her eyes left the wallet and examined Malone\nfrom head to foot. It was perfectly plain that they didn't like what\nthey saw. \"Cop,\" she said again, as if to herself. It sounded like a\ncurse.\n\nMalone said: \"Well, I--\"\n\n\"You want to ask me stupid questions,\" she said. \"That is what you want\nto do. I'm right?\"\n\n\"I only--\"\n\n\"I know nothing,\" she said. \"Nothing of any kind.\" She closed her mouth\nand stood regarding him as if he were a particularly repulsive statue.\nMalone looked past her into the living room beyond the door.\n\nIt was faded, now, but it had once been bright and colorful. There was\nan old rug on the floor, and tables were everywhere. The one bright\nthing about the room was the assortment of flowers; there were flowers\neverywhere, in vases, in pots and even in windowboxes. There was also a\nlot of crockery statuary, mostly faded, chipped or worn in some way. The\nroom looked to Malone as if its last inhabitant had died ten years\nbefore; only the flowers had been renewed. Everything else had not only\nthe appearance of age, but the look of having been cast up as a\nhigh-water mark by the sea, which had receded and left only the tangled\nwreckage.\n\nThe woman cleared her throat and Malone's gaze came back to her. \"I can\ntell you nothing,\" she said.\n\n\"I don't want to talk to you,\" Malone said again. \"I want to talk to\nMike.\"\n\nHer eyes were very cold. \"You from the police, and you want to talk to\nMike. You make a joke. Only I don't think the joke is very funny.\"\n\n\"Joke?\" Malone said. \"You mean Mike's not here?\"\n\nHer gaze never wavered. \"You know he is not,\" she said. \"Ten minutes ago\nthe policemen were taking him away to the police station. How then could\nhe be here?\"\n\n\"Ten minutes ago?\" Malone blinked. Ten minutes ago he had been looking\nfor this apartment. Probably it hadn't taken Lynch's men ten minutes to\nfind it; they weren't strangers in New York. \"He was arrested?\" Malone\nsaid.\n\n\"I said so, didn't I?\" the woman said. \"You must be crazy or else\nsomething.\" Her eyes were still cold points, but Malone saw a glow of\ntears behind them. Mike was her son. She did not seem surprised that the\npolice had taken him away, but she was determined to protect him.\n\nMalone's voice was very gentle. \"Why did they arrest him?\" he said.\n\nThe woman shrugged, a single sharp gesture. \"You ask me this?\"\n\n\"I'm not a cop,\" Malone said. \"I'm from the FBI.\"\n\n\"FBI?\" the woman said.\n\n\"It's all right,\" Malone said, with all the assurance he could muster.\n\"I only want to talk to him.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" the woman said. Tears were plain in her eyes now, glittering on\nthe surface. \"Why they take him away, I do not know. My Mike do nothing.\nNothing.\"\n\n\"But didn't they say anything about--\"\n\n\"They say?\" the woman cried. \"They say only they have orders from this\nLieutenant Lynch. He is lieutenant at police station.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Malone said gently.\n\n\"Lieutenant Lynch wants to ask Mike questions, so police come, take him\naway.\" Her English was beginning to lose ground as tears came.\n\n\"Lynch asked for him?\" Malone said. He frowned. Whatever that meant, he\nwanted to be there himself. And perhaps he could help the old woman in\nsome way. Anyhow, he would try. She stared up at him Stonily. \"Look,\nMrs. Fueyo,\" he said. \"I'm going down there to talk to Mike right now.\nAnd if he hasn't done anything, I'll see that he goes home to you. Right\naway.\"\n\nHer expression changed a trifle. She did not actually soften, but Malone\ncould feel the gratitude lurking behind her eyes as if it were afraid to\ncome out. She nodded gravely and said nothing at all. He stepped away,\nand she closed the door without a sound.\n\nHe stood staring at the door for a few seconds. Then he turned and\npunched the elevator button savagely.\n\nThere wasn't any time to lose.\n\nHe walked back to the precinct station. Knowing the way, it took him\nabout five minutes instead of the fifteen it had taken him to find the\nFueyo residence. But he still felt as if time were passing much too\nfast. He ran up the steps and passed right by the desk sergeant, who\napparently recognized him, and said nothing as Malone charged up the\nstairs to Lynch's office.\n\nIt was empty.\n\nMalone stared at it and started down the hall again without knowing\nwhere he was heading. Halfway to the stairs he met a patrolman. \"Where's\nLynch?\" he asked.\n\n\"The lieutenant?\"\n\nMalone fumed. \"Who else?\" he said. \"Where is he?\"\n\n\"Got some kid back in the tank, or somewhere,\" the patrolman said.\n\"Asking him a couple of questions, that's all.\" He added: \"Hey, listen,\nbuddy, why do you want to see the lieutenant? You can't just go charging\nin to--\"\n\nMalone was down the stairs before he'd finished. He went up to the\ndesk.\n\nThe desk sergeant looked down. \"What's it this time?\" he said.\n\n\"I'm in a hurry,\" Malone said. \"Where are the cells? I want to see\nLieutenant Lynch.\"\n\nThe desk sergeant nodded. \"O.K.,\" he said. \"But the lieutenant ain't in\nany of the cells. He's back in Interrogation with some kid.\"\n\n\"Take me there,\" Malone said.\n\n\"I'll show you,\" the sergeant said. \"On duty. Can't leave the desk.\" He\ncleared his throat and gave Malone a set of directions.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a door at the end of a corridor at the back of the station. It\nwas a plain wooden door with the numeral _1_ stenciled on it. Malone\nopened it and looked inside.\n\nHe was staring into a rather small, rather plain little room. There were\nabsolutely no bright beam lights burning, and there didn't seem to be\nany rubber hoses around anywhere. There were only four chairs.\n\nSeated in three of the chairs were Lieutenant Lynch and two other police\nofficers. In the fourth chair, facing them, was a young boy.\n\nHe didn't look like a tough kid. He had wavy black hair, brown eyes and\nwhat Malone thought looked like a generally friendly appearance. He was\nslight and wiry, not over five feet five or six. And he wore an\nexpression that was neither too eager nor hostile. It wasn't just blank,\neither; Malone finally pinned it down as Receptive.\n\nHe had the strangest impression that he had seen the boy somewhere\nbefore. But he couldn't remember when or where.\n\nLieutenant Lynch was talking.\n\n\"... All we want, Mike, is a little information. We thought you'd be\nable to help us, if you wanted to. Now, how about it?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Mike Fueyo said. His voice was a little high, but it was well\ncontrolled and responsive. \"Sure, lieutenant. I'll help if I can--but I\njust don't dig what you're giving me. It doesn't make sense.\"\n\nLynch stirred a little impatiently, and his voice began to carry a new\nbite. \"I'm talking about Cadillacs,\" he said. \"1972 Red Cadillacs.\"\n\n\"It's a nice car,\" Mike said.\n\n\"What do you know about them?\" Lynch said.\n\n\"Know about them?\" Mike said. \"I know they're nice cars. That's about\nit. What else am I going to know, lieutenant? Maybe you think I own one\nof these big red 1972 Caddies. Maybe you think I got that kind of money.\nWell, listen, lieutenant, I'd like to help you out, but I'm just not--\"\n\n\"The Cadillacs,\" Lynch said, \"were--\"\n\n\"Just a minute, lieutenant,\" Malone said. Dead silence fell with great\nsuddenness. Lynch and all the others looked around at Malone, who smiled\napologetically. \"I don't want to disturb anything,\" he said. \"But I\nwould like to talk to Mike here for a little while.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Lynch said sourly. \"Sure. Sure.\"\n\n\"I'd like to ask him a couple of questions,\" Malone said. \"Alone.\"\n\n\"Alone.\" Lynch said. \"Oh.\" But there was nothing for him to do, Malone\nknew, except bow to the inevitable. \"Of course,\" he said. \"Go right\nahead.\"\n\n\"You can stand outside the door,\" Malone said. \"He won't get away. And\nyou'd better hold this.\" Malone, knowing perfectly well that staying\narmed and alone in a room with a suspect was something you just did not\ndo--for very good reasons--unstrapped his .44 Magnum and handed it to\nthe lieutenant.\n\nHe left reluctantly, with his men.\n\nMalone could understand Lynch's attitude. If Malone solved the case,\nLynch would not get any credit. Otherwise, it might go down in his\npersonal record. And, of course, the NYPD would rather wrap the case up\nthemselves; the FBI was treated as a necessary interference.\nUnfortunately, Malone thought, Lynch had had absolutely no choice. He\nsighed gently, and turned his attention to Mike Fueyo, who was still\nsitting in his chair.\n\n\"Now, Mike--\" he began, and was interrupted.\n\nThe door opened. Lieutenant Lynch said: \"If you need us, Malone, just\nyell.\"\n\n\"You'll hear me,\" Malone promised. The door shut.\n\nHe turned back to the boy. \"Now, Mike,\" he began again, \"my name is\nMalone, and I'm with the FBI. I'd like to ask you a few--\"\n\n\"Gee, Mr. Malone,\" Mike broke in eagerly. \"I'm glad you're here.\"\n\nMalone said: \"Well, I--\"\n\n\"These cops here have been giving me a pretty rough deal, you know?\"\nMike said.\n\n\"I'm sure they--\" Malone began.\n\n\"But I've been looking for you,\" Mike went on. \"See, I wanted to say\nsomething to you. Something real important.\"\n\nMalone leaned forward expectantly. At last he was going to get some\ninformation--perhaps the information that would break the whole case\nwide open. He said: \"Yes?\"\n\n\"Well--\" Mike began, and stopped.\n\n\"You don't have to be afraid of me, Mike,\" Malone said. \"Just tell me\nwhatever's on your mind.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Mike said. \"It's this.\"\n\nHe took a deep breath. Malone clenched his fists. Now it was coming. Now\nhe would hear the all-important fact. He waited.\n\nMike stuck out his tongue and blew the longest, loudest, brassiest and\njuiciest Bronx cheer that Malone had ever heard.\n\nThen, almost instantly, the room was empty except for Malone himself.\n\nMike was gone.\n\nThere wasn't any place to hide, and there hadn't been any time to hide\nin. Malone looked around wildly, but he had no doubts at all.\n\nMike Fueyo had vanished, utterly and instantaneously. He'd gone out like\na light.\n\n\n\n\nVII.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nThirty seconds passed. During that time, Malone did nothing at all. He\njust sat there, while a confused montage of pictures tumbled through his\nhead. Sometimes he saw double exposures, and sometimes a couple of\npictures overlapped, but it didn't seem to make any difference, because\nnone of the pictures meant anything anyhow.\n\nThe reason for that was obvious. He was no longer sane. He had cracked\nup. At a crucial moment, his brain had failed him, and now people would\nhave to come in and cart him away and put him in a straitjacket. It was\nperfectly obvious to Malone that he was no longer capable of dealing\nwith everyday life. The blow on the head had probably taken final\neffect, and it had been more serious than the doctor had imagined.\n\nHe had always distrusted doctors anyhow.\n\nAnd now he was suffering from a delayed reaction. He wasn't living in\nthe real world any more. He had gone off to dreamland, where people\ndisappeared when you looked at them. There was no hope for him.\n\nIt was a nice theory, and it was even comforting, in a way. There was\nonly one thing wrong with it.\n\nThe room around him didn't look dreamlike at all. It was perfectly solid\nand real, and it looked just the way it had looked before Mike Fueyo had\n... well, Malone amended, before whatever had happened had happened. It\nwas a perfectly complete little room, and it had four chairs in it.\nMalone was sitting in one of the chairs and all the others were empty.\n\nThere was absolutely nothing else in the room.\n\nWith some regret, Malone abandoned the theory that he had gone mad. This\nleft him with no ideas at all. Because if he hadn't become insane, then\nwhat _had_ happened?\n\nAfter another second or two, some ideas began to filter through the\ndaze. Perhaps he'd just blacked out for a minute and the kid had gone\nout the door. That was possible, wasn't it?\n\nSure it was. And maybe he had just not seen the kid go. His eyes had\nfailed for a second or two. That could certainly happen, after a blow on\nthe head. Malone tried to remember where the sight centers of the brain\nwere. Maybe whoever had hit him had disturbed them, and he'd had a\nsudden blackout.\n\nCome to think of it, that made pretty good sense. If he had blacked out,\nthen Mike would have seen it as he went groggy, and Mike had just walked\nout the door. It had to be the door, of course--the windows were out of\nthe question, since there weren't any windows. And six-inch-wide\nair-conditioner ducts do not provide reasonable space for an exit, not\nif you happen to be a human being.\n\nThat, Malone told himself, was settled--and a good thing, too. He had\nbegun to worry about it. But now he knew just what had happened, and he\nfelt relieved. He got up from his chair, walked over to the door and\nopened it.\n\nLieutenant Lynch nearly fell into the room. He'd obviously had his ear\npressed tightly to the door and hadn't expected it to open. The other\ntwo cops stood behind him, just about filling the hallway with their\nbroad shoulders.\n\n\"Well, well,\" Malone said.\n\nLynch recovered his balance and glared at the FBI agent. He said\nnothing.\n\n\"Where is he?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Where is he?\" Lynch repeated, and blinked. \"Where's _who_?\"\n\nMalone shook his head impatiently. \"Fueyo,\" he said.\n\nLynch's expression was the same as that on the faces of the other two\ncops: complete and utter bafflement. Malone stopped and stared. It was\nsuddenly very obvious that the lovely theory he had worked out for\nMike's disappearance wasn't true in the least. If Mike Fueyo had come\nout the door, then these cops would know about it. But they obviously\nknew nothing at all about it.\n\nTherefore, he hadn't come out through the door.\n\nMalone took a deep breath.\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" Lynch said. \"Isn't the kid in there with\nyou? What's happened?\"\n\nThere was only one thing to do and, straight-faced, Malone went ahead\nand did it. \"Of course not,\" he snapped, trying to sound impatient and\nofficial. \"I released him.\"\n\n\"You _what_?\"\n\n\"Released him,\" Malone said. He stepped out into the hall and closed the\ndoor of the interrogation room firmly behind him. \"I got all the\ninformation I needed, so I let him go.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Lynch said bitterly. \"After all, I was the one who--\"\n\n\"You called him in for questioning, didn't you, lieutenant?\" Malone\nsaid.\n\n\"Yes, I did, and I--\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"I questioned him.\"\n\nThere was a little silence. Then Lynch asked, in a strangled voice:\n\"What did he say?\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" Malone said at once. \"That's classified information.\" He pushed\nhis way into the corridor, trying to look as if he had fifteen other\njobs to accomplish within the next hour. Being an FBI agent was going to\nhelp a little, but he still had to look good in order to really carry it\noff.\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Thanks for your co-operation, lieutenant,\" Malone said. \"You've all\nbeen very helpful.\" He smiled at them in what he hoped was a superior\nmanner. \"So long,\" he said, and started walking.\n\n\"Wait!\" Lynch said. He flung open the door of the interrogation room.\nThere was no doubt that it was empty. \"Wait! Malone!\"\n\nMalone turned slowly, trying to look calm and in control of the\nsituation. \"Yes?\" he said.\n\nLynch looked at him with puzzled, pleading eyes. \"Malone, _how_ did you\nrelease him? We were right here. He didn't come through the door. There\nisn't any other exit. So how did you get him out?\"\n\nThere was only one answer to that, and Malone gave it with a quiet,\nassured air. \"I'm terribly sorry, lieutenant,\" he said, \"but that's\nclassified information, too.\" He gave the cops a little wave and walked\nslowly down the corridor. When he reached the stairs he began to speed\nup, and he was out of the precinct station and into a taxicab before any\nof the cops could have realized what had happened.\n\nHe took a deep breath, feeling as if it were the first he'd had in\nseveral days. \"Breathe air,\" he told himself. \"It's _good_ for you.\" Not\nthat New York had any real air in it. It was mostly carbon fumes and the\nlike. But it was the nearest thing to air that Malone could find at the\nmoment, and he determined to go right on breathing it until something\nbetter and cleaner showed up.\n\nBut that wasn't important now. As the cab tooled along down Broadway\ntoward Sixty-ninth Street, Malone closed his eyes and began going over\nthe whole thing in his mind.\n\nMike Fueyo had vanished.\n\nOf that, Malone told himself, there was no shadow of doubt. No probable,\npossible shadow of doubt.\n\nNo possible doubt--as a matter of fact--whatever.\n\nDismissing the Grand Inquisitor with a negligent wave of his hand, he\nconcentrated on the main question. It was a good question. Malone could\nhave sat and looked at it admiringly for a long time.\n\nAs a matter of fact, that was all he could think of to do, as the cab\nturned up Seventieth Street and headed east. He certainly didn't have\nany answers for it.\n\nBut it was a lovely question:\n\n_Where does that leave Kenneth J. Malone?_\n\nAnd, possibly even more important:\n\n_Where was Miguel Fueyo?_\n\nIt was obvious that he'd vanished on purpose. And it hadn't just been\nsomething he'd recently discovered. He had known all along that he could\npull the trick; if he hadn't known that, he wouldn't have done what he\nhad done beforehand. No seventeen-year-old boy, no matter what he was,\nwould give the FBI the raspberry unless he were pretty sure he could get\naway with it.\n\nMalone remembered the raspberry and winced slightly. The cab driver\ncalled back: \"Anything wrong, buddy?\"\n\n\"Everything,\" Malone said. \"But don't worry about it.\"\n\nThe cab driver shrugged and turned back to the wheel. Malone went back\nto Mike Fueyo.\n\nThe kid could make himself vanish at will.\n\nInvisibility?\n\nMalone thought about that for a while. The fact that it was impossible\ndidn't decide him against it. Everything was impossible; that much was\nclear. But he didn't think Mike Fueyo had just become invisible. No.\nThere had been the sense of a presence actually leaving the room. If\nMike had become invisible and stayed, Malone was sure he wouldn't have\nfelt the boy leave.\n\nMike had not just become invisible. (And what do I mean, \"just\"? Malone\nasked himself unhappily.) He had gone--elsewhere.\n\nThis brought him back full circle to his original question: where was\nthe boy now? But he ignored it for a minute or two as another, even more\ndifficult query presented itself.\n\nNever mind where, Malone told himself. _How?_\n\nSomething was bothering him. Malone realized that it had been bothering\nhim for a long time. At last he managed to locate it and hold it up to\nthe light for inspection.\n\nDr. O'Connor, the psionics expert at Westinghouse, had mentioned\nsomething during Malone's last conversation with him. Dr. O'Connor,\nwho'd invented a telepathy detector, had been discussing further reaches\nin his field.\n\n\"After all,\" he'd said, \"if thoughts can bridge any distance whatever,\nregardless of other barriers, there is no reason why matter could not do\nlikewise.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\" Malone had asked him, \"it doesn't. Or, anyhow, it\nhasn't so far.\"\n\n\"There's no way to be sure of that.\" Dr. O'Connor had said sternly.\n\"After all, we have no reports of it--but that means little. Our search\nhas only begun.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"Sure.\"\n\n\"Matter, controlled by thought, might bridge distances instantaneously,\"\nDr. O'Connor had said.\n\nAnd he'd referred to something, some word....\n\n_Teleportation._\n\nThat was it. Malone sat back. All you had to do, he reflected, was to\nthink yourself somewhere else, and--_bing!_--you were there. If Malone\nhad been able to do it, it would not only save him a lot of time and\ntrouble, but also such things as cab fare and train fare and ... oh, a\nlot of different things.\n\nBut he couldn't. And Dr. O'Connor hadn't found anyone else who could,\neither. As far as Malone knew, nobody could teleport.\n\nExcept Mike Fueyo.\n\nThe cab stopped in front of FBI Headquarters. \"You some kind of secret\nagent?\" the cabbie said.\n\n\"Of course not,\" Malone said pleasantly. \"I'm a foreign spy.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" the cabbie said. \"Sure.\" He took his money with a somewhat puzzled\nair, while Malone crossed the sidewalk and went into the building.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEveryone was active. Malone pushed his way through arguing knots of men\nuntil he reached the small office which he and Boyd had been assigned.\nHe had already decided not to tell Boyd about the disappearing boy. That\nwould only confuse him--and matters were confused enough as they stood.\nMalone had no proof; he had only his word and the word of a few baffled\npolicemen, all of whom were probably thoroughly confused by now.\n\nBoyd had a job to do, and Malone had decided to let him go on doing it.\nThat, as a matter of fact, was what he was doing when Malone entered the\nroom.\n\nHe was sitting at his desk, talking on the telephone. Malone couldn't\nsee the face on the screen, but Boyd was scowling at it fiercely.\n\"Sure,\" he said. \"So some guy makes a fuss. That's what you're for.\"\n\n\"But he wants to sue the city,\" a voice said tinnily. \"Or somebody.\"\n\n\"Let him sue,\" Boyd said. \"We've got authority. Just get that car.\"\n\n\"Look,\" the voice said. \"I--\"\n\n\"I don't care how,\" Boyd snapped. \"Get it. Then hand it over to the\npickup-squad and say: 'Mr. Malone wants this car--immediately.' They'll\nknow what to do. Got that?\"\n\n\"Sure, Mr. Boyd,\" the voice said. \"But I don't--\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" Boyd said. \"Go ahead and get the job done. The United\nStates of America is depending on you.\" With one last scowl, he hung up\nand swung around to face Malone. \"You gave me a great job,\" he said. \"I\nreally love it, you know that?\"\n\n\"It's got to be done,\" Malone said in a noncommittal voice. \"How's it\ngoing so far?\"\n\nBoyd closed his eyes for a second. \"Twenty-three red 1972 Cadillacs to\ndate--which isn't bad, I suppose,\" he said. \"And six calls like the one\nyou just heard. All from agents with problems. What am I supposed to do\nwhen a guy catches a couple necking in a 1972 red Cadillac?\"\n\n\"At this time of day?\" Malone said.\n\n\"New York,\" Boyd said, and shrugged. \"Things are funny here.\"\n\nMalone nodded. \"What did you do about them?\" he said.\n\n\"Told the agent to take the car and give 'em a pass to a movie,\" Boyd\nsaid.\n\n\"Good,\" Malone said. \"Keep that sort of thing in the dark where it\nbelongs.\" For some reason, this reminded him of Dorothy. He still had to\nget tickets for a show. But that could wait. \"How about the assembly\nline?\" he said.\n\n\"Disassembly,\" Boyd said. \"Leibowitz has started it going. He borrowed\nthe use of a big auto repair shop over in Jersey City, and they'll be\ndoing a faster job than we thought.\" He paused. \"But it's been a\nwonderful day,\" he said. \"One to remember as long as I live. Possibly\neven until tomorrow. And how have you been doing?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"I'm not absolutely sure yet.\"\n\n\"That's a nice, helpful answer,\" Boyd said. \"In the best traditions of\nthe FBI.\"\n\n\"I can't help it,\" Malone said. \"It's true.\"\n\n\"Well, what have you been doing?\" Boyd said. \"Drinking? Living it up\nwhile I sit here and talk to people about Cadillacs?\"\n\n\"Not exactly,\" Malone said. \"I've been ... well, doing more or less what\nBurris told me to do. Nosing around. Keeping my eyes open.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe phone chimed. Boyd flipped up the mike and eyed the screen\nbalefully. \"Federal Bureau of Investigation,\" he said crisply. \"Who are\nyou?\"\n\nA voice on the other end said: \"What?\" before the image on the screen\ncleared.\n\n\"Oh,\" a voice said. It was a very calm, quiet voice. \"Hello, Boyd.\"\n\nThe image cleared. Boyd was facing the picture of a man in his middle\nthirties, a brown-haired man with large, gentle brown eyes and an\nexpression that somehow managed to look both sad and confident. \"Hello,\nDr. Leibowitz,\" Boyd said.\n\n\"Is Mr. Malone in?\" Leibowitz said. \"I really wanted to talk to him.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Sure,\" Boyd said. \"Just a second.\"\n\nHe motioned to Malone, who came around and sat at Boyd's desk as Boyd\ngot up. He nodded to Leibowitz, and the electronics engineer nodded\nback.\n\n\"How's everything coming, Dr. Leibowitz?\" Malone said.\n\nLeibowitz shrugged meaningfully. \"All right,\" he said. \"I called you to\ntell you about that, by the way. We've managed to cut the per-car time\ndown somewhat.\"\n\n\"That's wonderful,\" Malone said.\n\n\"It's now down to about four hours per car--and that means we may be\nable to do even better than running one off the line every fifteen\nminutes. At the moment, fifteen minutes is about standard, though, with\nsixteen cars in the line.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"But anything you can do to speed it up--\"\n\n\"I understand,\" Leibowitz said. \"Of course, I'll do anything that I can\nfor you. I have got a small preliminary report, by the way.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"The first car has just been turned off the assembly line,\" Leibowitz\nsaid. \"And I'm afraid, Mr. Malone, that there's nothing odd about it at\nall.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"we can't expect to hit the jackpot with our first\ntry.\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" Leibowitz said. \"But the second should be off soon. And\nthen the rest. I'm keeping my eye on every one, of course.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Malone said, and meant it. Leibowitz was the kind of man who\ninspired instant, and complete trust. Malone was perfectly sure he'd do\nthe job he had started to do. Then an idea struck him. \"Has the first\ncar been reassembled yet?\" he asked.\n\n\"Of course,\" Leibowitz said. \"We took that step into account in our\ntiming. What would you like done with it--and with the other ones, as\nthey come off?\"\n\n\"Unless you can find something odd about a car, just return it to its\nowner,\" Malone said. \"Or pass the problem on to the squad men--they'll\ntake care of it.\" He paused. \"If you do find something odd--\"\n\n\"I'll call you at once, of course,\" Leibowitz said.\n\n\"Good,\" Malone said. \"Incidentally, I did want to ask you something. I\ndon't want you to think I'm doubting your work, or anything like that.\nBelieve me.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you're not,\" Leibowitz said.\n\n\"But,\" Malone said, \"why does it take so long? I'd think it would be\nfairly easy to spot a robotic or a semirobotic brain capable of\ncontrolling a car.\"\n\n\"It might have been, once.\" Leibowitz said. \"But these days the problems\nare rather special. Oh, I don't mean we can't do it--we can and we will.\nBut with subminiaturization, Mr. Malone, and semipsionic circuits, a\npretty good brain can be hidden beneath a coat of paint.\"\n\nFor no reason at all, Malone suddenly thought of Dorothy again. \"A coat\nof paint?\" he said in a disturbed tone.\n\n\"Certainly,\" Leibowitz said, and smiled at him. It was a warm smile that\nhad little or nothing to do with the problem they were talking about.\nBut Malone liked it. It made him feel as if Leibowitz liked him, and\napproved of him. He grinned back.\n\n\"But a coat of paint isn't very much,\" Malone said.\n\n\"It doesn't have to be very much,\" Leibowitz said. \"Not these days. I've\noften told Emily--that's my wife, Mr. Malone--that I could hide a TV\ncircuit under her lipstick. Not that there would be any use in it--but\nthe techniques are there, Mr. Malone. And if your conjecture is correct,\nsomeone is using them.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"Sure. But you _can_ find the circuits, if they're\nthere?\"\n\nLeibowitz nodded slowly. \"We can, Mr. Malone,\" he said. \"They betray\nthemselves. A microcircuit need not be more than a few microns thick,\nyou see--as far as the conductors and insulators are concerned, at any\nrate. But the regulators--transistors and such--have to be as big as a\npinhead.\"\n\n\"Enormous, huh?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Well,\" Leibowitz said, and chuckled, \"quite large enough to locate\nwithout trouble, at any rate. They're very hard to conceal. And the\nleads from the brain to the power controls are even easier to\nfind--comparatively speaking, of course.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Malone said.\n\n\"All the brain does, you see,\" Leibowitz said, \"is control the mechanism\nthat steers the car. But it takes real power to steer--a great deal more\nthan it does to compute the steering.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Malone, who didn't, said desperately. \"In other words, unless\nsomething radically new has been developed, you can find the circuits.\"\n\n\"Right,\" Leibowitz said, grinning. \"It would have to be something very\nnew indeed, Mr. Malone. We're up on most of the latest developments\nhere; we've got to be. But I don't want the credit for this.\"\n\n\"No?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" Leibowitz said. \"All I do is work out the general application\nto theory, as far as actual detection is concerned. It's my partner, Mr.\nHardin, who takes care of all the engineering details.\"\n\nMalone said: \"Well, so long as one of you--\"\n\n\"Sal's a real crackerjack,\" Leibowitz said enthusiastically. \"He has an\nintuitive feel about these things. It's really amazing to watch him go\nto work.\"\n\n\"It must be,\" Malone said politely.\n\n\"Oh, it really is,\" Leibowitz said. \"And it's because of Sal that I can\nmake the guarantee I do make: that if there are any unusual circuits in\nthose cars, we can find them.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Malone said. \"I'm sure you'll do the job. And we need that\ninformation. Don't bother to send along a detailed report, though,\nunless you find something out of the ordinary.\"\n\n\"Of course, Mr. Malone,\" Leibowitz said. \"I wouldn't have bothered you\nexcept for the production speed-up here.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" Malone said. \"It's perfectly all right. I'll be hearing\nfrom you, then?\"\n\n\"Certainly, Mr. Malone,\" Leibowitz said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMalone cut the circuit at once and started to turn away, but he never\ngot the chance. It started to chime again at once.\n\n\"Federal Bureau of Investigation,\" Malone said as he flipped up the\nreceiver. He wanted badly to copy Boyd's salutation, but he found that\nhe just didn't have the gall to do it, and said sadly instead: \"Malone\nspeaking.\"\n\nThere was no immediate answer from the other party. Instead, the screen\nslowly cleared, showing Malone the picture of a woman he recognized\ninstantly.\n\nIt was Juanita Fueyo--Mike's mother.\n\nMalone stared at her. It seemed to him as if a couple of hours passed\nwhile he tried to find his voice. Of course, she'd looked up the FBI\nnumber in the phone book, and found him that way. But she was about the\nlast person on Earth from whom he'd expected a call.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Malone,\" she said, \"thank you so much! You got my Mike back\nfrom the police!\"\n\nMalone gulped. \"I did?\" he said. \"Well, I--\"\n\n\"But Mr. Malone--you must help me again! Because now my Mike says he\nmust not stay at home! He is leaving, he is leaving right away!\"\n\n\"Leaving?\" Malone said.\n\nHe thought of a thousand things to do. He could send a squad of men to\narrest Mike. And Mike could disappear while they were trying to get hold\nof him. He could go down himself--and be greeted, if he knew Mike Fueyo,\nwith another giant economy-size raspberry. He could try to plead with\nMike on the phone.\n\nAnd what good would that do?\n\nSo, instead, he just sat and stared while Mrs. Fueyo went right on.\n\n\"He says he will send me money, but money is nothing compared to my own\nboy, my own Mike. He says he must go away, Mr. Malone--but I know you\ncan stop him! I know it!\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"But I--\"\n\n\"Oh, I knew that you would!\" Mrs. Fueyo shrieked. She almost came\nthrough the screen at him. \"You are a great man, Mr. Malone! I will say\nmany prayers for you! I will never stop from praying for you because you\nhelp me!\" Her voice and face changed abruptly. \"Excuse me now,\" she\nsaid. \"I must go back to work.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"if I--\"\n\nThen she turned back and beamed at him again. \"Oh, thank you, Mr.\nMalone! Thank you with the thanks of a mother! Bring my boy back to me!\"\n\nAnd the image faded and died.\n\nBoyd tapped Malone on the shoulder. \"I didn't know you were involved in\nan advice column for the lovelorn,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm not,\" Malone said sourly.\n\nBoyd sighed. \"I'll bite,\" he said. \"Who was that?\"\n\nMalone thought of several possible answers and finally chose one.\n\"That,\" he said, \"was my mother-in-law. She worries about me every time\nI go out on a job with you.\"\n\n\"Very funny,\" Boyd said. \"I am screaming with laughter.\"\n\n\"Just get back to work, Tommy-boy,\" Malone said, \"and leave everything\nto me.\"\n\nHe hoped he sounded more confident than he felt. Lighting a\ncigarette--and wishing he were alone in his own room, so that he could\nsmoke a cigar and not have to worry about looking dashing and\nalert--Malone strolled out of the office with a final wave to Boyd. He\nwas thinking about Mike Fueyo, and he stopped his chain of reasoning\njust long enough to look in at the office of the Agent-in-Charge and ask\nhim to pry loose two tickets for \"The Hot Seat\" that night.\n\nThe agent, a tall, thin man, who looked as if he suffered from chronic\nstomach trouble, said, \"You must be crazy. Are they all like that in\nWashington?\"\n\n\"No,\" Malone said cheerfully. \"Some of them are pretty normal. There's\nthis one man--Napoleon, we call him--who keeps insisting that he should\nhave won the battle of Waterloo. But otherwise he's perfectly fine.\"\n\nHe flicked his cigarette in the air and left, grinning. Five steps away\nthe grin disappeared and a frown took its place.\n\n\n\n\nVIII.\n\n\nHe walked along Sixty-ninth Street to Park Avenue without noticing where\nhe was going. Luckily, the streets weren't really crowded, and Malone\nonly had to apologize twice, once for stepping on a man's toe and once\nfor absently toeing a woman's dog. When he reached the corner he headed\ndowntown, humming \"Kathleen Mavourneen\" under his breath and trying to\nfigure out his next move.\n\nHe needed more than one move. He needed a whole series of moves. This\nwas not the usual kind of case. Burris had called it a vacation and, in\none way, Malone supposed, Burris was perfectly right. For once there was\nno question about who had committed the crimes. It was obvious by now\nthat Mike Fueyo and his Silent Spooks had been stealing the Cadillacs.\n\nIt was even obvious that Mike--or someone with Mike's talent--had bopped\nhim on the head, and taken the red Cadillac he had been examining. And\nthe same gang probably accounted for the Sergeant Jukovsky affair, too.\n\nOr at least it was reasonable to assume that they did, Malone thought.\nHe could see how it had worked: one of the Silent Spooks was a lot\nsmaller than a grown man, and the two cops who hadn't seen anyone in the\nparked car just hadn't been able to catch sight of the undersized\ndriver. Of course, there _had_ been someone in the car when it had been\ndriving along the West Side Highway. Someone who had teleported himself\nright out of the car when it had gone over the embankment.\n\nThat, of course, meant that there would be no secret machines found in\nthe red Cadillacs Leibowitz & Hardin were examining now. But Malone had\nalready decided to let that phase of things go on. First of all, it was\nalways possible that he was wrong, and that some such machine really\ndid exist. Second, even if they didn't find a machine, they might find\nsomething else. Almost anything, he thought, might turn up.\n\nAnd, third, it kept Boyd decently busy, and out of Malone's hair.\n\nThat had been an easy solution. And, Malone thought, the problem of who\nhad been taking the red Cadillacs looked just as easy now, if his\nanswers were right. And he was reasonably sure of that.\n\nUnfortunately, he was now left with a new and unusual question:\n\n_How do you catch a teleport?_\n\nMalone looked up, jarred to a stop by a man built like a brown bear,\nwith a chunky body and an oval, slightly sloping head and face. He had\nvery short brown hair shot through with gray, and he gave Malone a\nsmall, inquisitive stare and looked away without a word.\n\nMalone mumbled: \"Sorry,\" and looked up at the street sign. He was at\nForty-seventh Street and Park Avenue. He jerked a hand up to his face,\nand managed to hook the chunky man by the suit. It fell away, exposing\nthe initials SM carefully worked into his shirt. Second Mistake, Malone\nthought wildly, muttered: \"Sorry,\" again and turned west, feeling fairly\ngrateful to the unfortunate bystander.\n\nHe had reminded Malone of one thing. If he wanted to get even a part of\nhis plan past the drawing-board stage, he had to make a phone call in a\nhurry.\n\nHe found a phone booth in a bar called the Ad Lib, at Madison Avenue.\nSternly telling himself that he was stopping there to make a phone call,\na business phone call, and not to have a drink, he marched right past\nthe friendly bartender and went into the phone booth, where he made a\ncall to New York Police Commissioner John Henry Fernack.\n\nFernack's face was that of an old man, but there was no telling how old.\nThe early seventies was one guess, Malone imagined; the late fifties\nmight be another. He looked tough, as if he had spent all of his life\ntrying to persuade other people that he was young enough for the\nhandball tournament. When he saw Malone, his eyebrows lifted slightly,\nbut he didn't say anything.\n\n\"Commissioner,\" Malone said, \"I called to ask you to do me a favor.\"\n\nThere was caution hidden in the calm and quiet voice. \"Well,\" Fernack\nsaid, \"what is it, Malone?\"\n\n\"Can you have all the robberies for a given period run through the\ncomputer?\" Malone said. \"I need some dope.\"\n\n\"Depends on the given period,\" Fernack said. \"I can't do it for 1774.\"\n\n\"What would I need data on robberies in 1774 for?\" Malone said, honestly\ninterested.\n\n\"I never question the FBI,\" Fernack said soberly. \"But what dates do you\nwant?\"\n\n\"The past year, maybe the past year and a half.\"\n\n\"And what data?\"\n\n\"I want every reported crime that hasn't been solved,\" Malone said,\n\"which also seems to have been committed by some impossible means. A\nsafe that was robbed without being opened, for instance--that's the kind\nof thing I mean.\"\n\n\"Every unsolved crime?\" Fernack said. \"Now, hold your horses, Malone.\nI'm not at all sure that--\"\n\n\"Don't worry about a thing, commissioner,\" Malone said. \"This is\nconfidential.\"\n\n\"You know how I'd feel about this if word ever got out to--\"\n\n\"I said confidential, John Henry,\" Malone said, trying to sound friendly\nand trustworthy. \"After all, every place has unsolved crimes. Even the\nFBI isn't absolutely perfect.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Fernack said. \"Sure. But confidential, Malone.\"\n\n\"You have my word,\" Malone said sincerely.\n\nFernack said: \"Well--\"\n\n\"How fast can you get the dope?\" Malone said.\n\n\"I don't exactly know,\" Fernack said. \"The last time anything even\nremotely like this was run through--departmental survey, but you\nwouldn't be interested--it took something like eight hours.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Malone said. \"Eight hours then. I'll look everything over and if\nwe need a second run-through it won't take too long. I'll let you know\nas soon as I can about that.\" He grinned into the phone.\n\nFernack cleared his throat and asked delicately: \"Mind telling me what\nall this is for?\"\n\nMalone offered up a little prayer before answering, and when he did\nanswer it was in his softest and most friendly tones: \"I'd rather not\nsay just now, John Henry.\"\n\n\"But Malone--\" Fernack's voice sounded a little strained, and his jaw\nset just a trifle. \"If you--\"\n\nMalone knew perfectly well how Fernack reacted when he didn't get a bit\nof information he wanted. And this was no time to set off any fireworks\nin the commissioner's office. \"Look, John Henry,\" he said gently, \"I'll\ntell you as soon as I can. Honest. But this is classified\ninformation--it's not my fault.\"\n\nFernack said: \"But--\" and apparently realized that argument was not\ngoing to do him any good. \"All right, Malone,\" he said at last. \"I'll\nhave it for you as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"Great,\" Malone said. \"Then I'll see you later.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Fernack said. He paused, as if he were about to open the\ncontroversy just once more. But all he said was: \"So long, Malone.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMalone breathed a great sigh of relief and flipped the phone off. He\nstepped out of the booth feeling so proud of himself that he could\nbarely walk. Not only had he managed to calm down Commissioner Fernack,\nhe had also walked right past a bar on the way to the phone. He had\nperformed several acts, he felt, above and beyond the call of duty, and\nhe told himself that he deserved a reward.\n\nHappily, the reward was convenient to hand. He went to the bar and\nbeckoned the bartender over to him. \"Bourbon and soda,\" he said. \"And a\nmedal, if possible.\"\n\n\"What?\" the bartender said.\n\n\"A medal,\" Malone said. \"For conduct beyond reproach.\"\n\nThe bartender nodded sadly. \"Maybe you just ought to go home, Mac,\" he\nsaid. \"Sleep it off.\"\n\nNew Yorkers, Malone decided as the bartender went off to get his drink,\nhad no sense of humor. Back in Chicago--where he'd been more or less\nweaned on gin, and discovered that, unlike his father, he didn't much\ncare for the stuff--and even in Washington, people didn't go around\naccusing you of drunkenness just because you made some harmless little\npleasantry.\n\nOh, well. Malone drank his drink and went out into the afternoon\nsunlight.\n\nHe considered the itinerary of the Magical Miguel Fueyo. He had gone\nstraight home from the police station, apparently, and had then told his\nmother that he was going to leave home. But he had promised to send her\nmoney.\n\nOf course, money was easy for Mike to get. With a shudder, Malone\nthought he was beginning to realize just _how_ easy. Houdini had once\nboasted that no bank vault could hold him. In Mike Fueyo's case, that\nwas just doubly true. The vault could neither hold him out or keep him\nin.\n\nBut he was going to leave home.\n\nMalone said: \"Hm-m-m,\" to himself, cleared his throat and tried it\nagain. By now he was at the corner of the block, where he nearly\ncollided with a workman who was busily stowing away a gigantic ladder, a\npot of paint and a brush. Malone looked up at the street sign, where the\nwords: \"Avenue of the Americas\" had been painted out, and \"Sixth Avenue\"\nhand-lettered in.\n\n\"They finally gave in,\" the painter told him. \"But do you think they'll\nbuy new signs? Nah. Cheap. That's all they are. Cheap as pretzels.\" He\ngave Malone a friendly push with one end of the ladder and disappeared\ninto the crowd.\n\nMalone didn't have the faintest idea of what he was talking about. And\nhow cheap could a pretzel be, anyway? Malone didn't remember ever having\nseen an especially tight-fisted one.\n\nNew York, he decided for the fifteenth time, was a strange place.\n\nHe walked downtown for a block, still thinking about Mike Fueyo, and\nabsently turned west again. Between Sixth and Seventh, he had another\nattack of brilliance and began looking for another phone booth.\n\nHe found one in a Mexican bar named the Xochitl, across the street from\nthe Church of Saint Mary the Virgin. It was just a coincidence that he\nhad landed in another bar, he told himself hopefully, but he didn't\nquite believe it. To prove it to himself, he headed straight for the\nphone booths again and put in his call, ignoring the blandishments of\nseveral rows of sparkling bottles which he passed on the way.\n\nHe dialed the number for Lieutenant Lynch's precinct, and then found\nhimself connected with a new desk sergeant.\n\n\"I'm Malone,\" he said. \"I want to talk to Lynch.\"\n\n\"Glad to know you, Malone,\" the desk sergeant said pleasantly. \"Only\n_Lieutenant_ Lynch doesn't want to subscribe to the Irish _Echo_.\"\n\n\"I'm the FBI.\" He showed his badge.\n\nThe desk sergeant took a good long look at it. \"Maybe you are, and maybe\nyou aren't,\" he said at last. \"Does the lieutenant know you?\"\n\n\"We were kids together,\" Malone said. \"We're brothers. Siamese twins.\nPut him on the phone.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" said the desk sergeant. \"I'll check.\"\n\nThe screen went blank for two agonizing minutes before it cleared again\nto show Lynch's face.\n\n\"Hello, Mr. Malone,\" Lynch said formally. \"Have you found some new\nlittle trick to show us poor, stupid policemen? Like, say, making\nyourself vanish?\"\n\n\"I'll make the whole police force vanish,\" Malone said, \"in a couple of\nminutes. I called to ask a favor.\"\n\n\"Anything,\" Lynch said. \"Anything within my poor power. Whatever I have\nis yours. Whither thou goest--\"\n\n\"Knock it off,\" Malone said, and then grinned. After all, there was no\nsense in making an enemy out of Lynch.\n\nLynch blinked, took a deep breath, and said in an entirely different\nvoice: \"O.K., Malone. What's the favor?\"\n\n\"Do you still have that list of Silent Spooks?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Sure I do,\" Lynch said. \"Why? I gave you a copy of it.\"\n\n\"I can't do this job,\" Malone said \"You'll have to.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Lynch said, and saluted.\n\n\"Just listen,\" Malone said. \"I want you to check up on every kid on that\nlist.\"\n\n\"And what are we supposed to do when we find them?\" Lynch said.\n\n\"That's the trouble,\" Malone said. \"You won't.\"\n\n\"And why not?\"\n\n\"I'll lay you ten to one,\" Malone said, \"that every one of them has\nskipped out. Left home. Without giving a forwarding address.\"\n\nLynch nodded slowly. \"Ten to one?\" he said. \"Want to make that a money\nbet? Or does the FBI frown on gambling?\"\n\n\"Ten dollars to your one,\" Malone said. \"O.K.?\"\n\n\"Made,\" Lynch said. \"You've got the bet ... just for the hell of it,\nunderstand.\"\n\n\"Oh, sure,\" Malone said.\n\n\"And where can I call you to collect?\"\n\nMalone shook his head. \"You can't,\" he said. \"I'll call you.\"\n\n\"I will wait with anxiety,\" Lynch said. \"But it had better be before\neight. I get off then.\"\n\n\"If I can make it,\" Malone said.\n\n\"If you can't,\" Lynch said, \"call me at home.\" He gave Malone the\nnumber, and then added: \"Whatever information I get, I can keep for my\nown use this time, can't I?\"\n\n\"You've already got all the information you're going to get. I just gave\nit to you.\"\n\n\"That,\" Lynch said, \"we'll see.\"\n\n\"I'll call to collect my money,\" Malone said.\n\n\"We'll talk about it later,\" Lynch said. \"Farewell, old pal.\"\n\n\"Flights of angels,\" Malone said, \"sing thee to thy rest.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMalone replaced the microphone and headed for the door. Halfway there,\nhowever, he stopped. He hadn't had a _tequila_ in a long time, and he\nthought he owed it to himself. He felt he had come out ahead in his\nexchange with Lynch, and another medal was in order.\n\nOnly a small one, though. He told himself that he would order one\n_tequila_ and quit. Besides, he had to meet Dorothy.\n\nHe sat down on one of the tall bar stools. The bartender bustled over\nand eyed him speculatively.\n\n\"_Tequila con limon_\" he said negligently.\n\n\"Ah,\" the bartender said. \"_Si, senor_.\"\n\nMalone waited with ill-concealed impatience. At last it arrived.\n\nMalone took the small glass of _tequila_ in his right hand, with the\nslice of lemon held firmly between the index and middle fingers of the\nsame hand, the rind facing in toward the glass. On the web between the\nthumb and forefinger of his left hand he had sprinkled a little salt.\nMoving adroitly and with dispatch, he downed the _tequila_, licked off\nthe salt and bit his teeth into the lemon slice.\n\nIt felt better than good; it felt wonderful. He hadn't had such a good\ntime in years.\n\nHe had three more before he left the Xochitl.\n\nThen, noticing the time, he moved in a hurry and got out of the bar\nbefore temptation overcame him and he started ordering still more. It\nwas nearly six o'clock, and he had to meet Dorothy at Topp's.\n\nHe hoped he could find it.\n\nHe headed downtown toward Forty-second Street, turned left and--sure\nenough--there was a big red sign. It said Topp's. Malone beamed his\napproval at it. It was just where it ought to be, and he was grateful.\n\nHe pushed open the glass door of the place and went in.\n\nThe _ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel_ was a chunky man with a pleasant face, a receding\nhairline and some distance back on his head, dark, curly hair. He beamed\nat Malone as if the FBI agent were a long-lost brother. \"Table for one,\nsir?\" he said.\n\n\"No,\" Malone said, peering into the place. It was much bigger than he\nhad expected. \"No,\" he said again. \"I guess I'll just have a drink at\nthe bar.\"\n\nThe _ma\u00eetre d'_ smiled and bowed him to a bar stool. Malone sat down and\nlooked the place over again. His first glance had shown him that Dorothy\nwasn't there yet, but he saw no harm in making sure. _Always be careful\nof your facts_, he admonished himself a little fuzzily.\n\nThere were a lot of women in the place, but they were all with escorts.\nSome of them had two escorts, and Malone wondered about them. Were they\ndrunk, or was he? It was obvious that someone was seeing double, but\nMalone wasn't quite sure who.\n\nHe stared at his face in the bar mirror for a few seconds, and ordered a\nbourbon and soda when a bartender came over and occluded the image. The\nbartender went away and Malone went on studying himself.\n\nHe wasn't bad-looking for an FBI agent. He was taller than his father,\nanyway, and less heavily built. That was one good thing. As a matter of\nfact, Malone told himself, he was really a pretty good-looking guy.\n\nSo why did women keep him waiting?\n\nHe heard her voice before he saw her, behind him. But she wasn't talking\nto him.\n\n\"Hello, Milty,\" she said. \"How's everything?\"\n\nMalone turned around to get a look at Milty. He turned out to be the\n_ma\u00eetre d'_. What did he have that Malone didn't have? the agent asked\nhimself sourly. Obviously Dorothy was captivated by his charm. Well,\nthat showed him what city girls were like. Butterflies. Social\nbutterflies. Flitting hither and yon with the wind, now attracted to\nthis man, now to that. Once, Malone told himself sadly, he had known\nthis beautiful woman. Now she belonged to someone else.\n\nHe felt a little bit sad about it, but he told himself to buck up and\nlearn to live with his tragedy. He drank some more of his bourbon and\nsoda, and then she noticed him.\n\nHe heard her say: \"Oh. Excuse me, Milty. There's my man.\" She came over\nand sat down next to him.\n\nHe wanted to ignore her, just to teach her a lesson. But he had already\nturned around and smiled at her, and she smiled back.\n\n\"Hi,\" she said. \"Did you get the tickets?\"\n\n_Tickets!_\n\nMalone knew there had been something he'd forgotten, and now he knew\nwhat it was. \"Oh,\" he said. \"Sure. Just a second. I've got to check up.\"\n\n\"Check up?\"\n\n\"Friend of mine,\" Malone improvised hurriedly. \"Bringing them.\" He gave\nDorothy a big smile and climbed down off the bar stool. He managed to\nfind a phone booth, and dialed FBI headquarters on Sixty-ninth Street\nand blessed several saints when he found that A-in-C was still there.\n\n\"Tickets,\" Malone said.\n\nThe Agent-in-Charge blinked at him. \"What tickets?\" he said.\n\n\"The 'Hot Seat' tickets,\" Malone said. \"Did you get 'em?\"\n\n\"I got 'em,\" the Agent-in-Charge said sourly. \"Had to chase all over\ntown and pull more wires than there are on a grand piano. But they\nturned up, brother. Two seats. Do you know what a job like that\nentails?\"\n\n\"I'm grateful,\" Malone said. \"I'm hysterical with gratitude.\"\n\n\"I'd rather track down a gang of fingerless second-story men than go\nthrough that again,\" the Agent-in-Charge said. He looked as if his\nstomach trouble had suddenly gotten a great deal worse. Malone thought\nthat the A-in-C was considering calling a doctor, and would probably\ndecide to make it the undertaker instead, and save the price of a call.\n\n\"I can't express my gratitude,\" Malone told him. \"Where are they? Where\ndo I pick them up?\"\n\n\"Box office,\" the A-in-C said sourly. \"I tell you, everybody in\nWashington must be nuts. The things I have to go through--\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Malone said. \"Thanks a lot. Thanks a million. If there's ever\nanything I can do for you, let me know and I'll do it.\" He hung up and\nwent back to the bar.\n\n\"Well?\" Dorothy said. \"Where do we go tonight? Joe's Hot Dog stand? Or a\nrevival of 'The Wild Duck' in a loft on Bleecker Street?\"\n\nThere was pride in Malone's manner as he stood there on his feet. There\nwas just a touch of hauteur as he said: \"We'll see 'Hot Seat'.\"\n\nAnd he was repaid for all of the Agent-in-Charge's efforts. Dorothy's\neyes went wide with appreciation and awe. \"My goodness,\" she said. \"A\nman of his word--and what a tough word, too! Mr. Malone, I congratulate\nyou.\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" Malone said. \"A mere absolute nothing.\"\n\n\"Nothing, the man says,\" Dorothy muttered. \"My goodness. And modest,\ntoo. Tell me: how do you do, Mr. Malone?\"\n\n\"Me?\" Malone said. \"Very well, so far.\" He finished his drink. \"And\nyou?\"\n\n\"I work at it,\" she said cryptically. \"May I have another drink?\"\n\nMalone gave her a grin. \"Another?\" he said. \"Have two. Have a dozen.\"\n\n\"And what,\" she said, \"would I do with half a dozen drinks? Don't\nanswer. I think I can guess. But let's just take them one at a\ntime--O.K.?\" She signaled to the bartender. \"Wally, I'll have a Martini.\nAnd Mr. Malone will have whatever it is he has, I imagine.\"\n\n\"Bourbon and soda,\" Malone said, and gave the bartender a grin, too,\njust to make sure he didn't feel left out. The sun was shining--although\nit was evening outside--and the birds were singing--although, Malone\nreflected, catching a bird on Forty-second Street and Broadway might\ntake a bit of doing--and all was well with the world.\n\nThere was only a tiny, nagging disturbing thought in his mind. It had to\ndo with Mike Fueyo and the Silent Spooks, and a lot of red Cadillacs.\nBut he pushed it resolutely away. It had nothing to do with the evening\nhe was about to spend. Nothing at all.\n\nAfter all, this _was_ supposed to be a vacation, wasn't it?\n\n\"Well, Mr. Malone,\" Dorothy said, when the drinks had arrived.\n\n\"Very well indeed,\" Malone said, raising his. \"And just call me Ken.\nDidn't I tell you that once before?\"\n\n\"You did,\" she said. \"And I asked you to call me Dorothy. Not Dotty. Try\nand remember that.\"\n\n\"I will remember it,\" Malone said, \"just as long as ever I live. You\ndon't look the least bit dotty, anyhow. Which is probably more than\nanybody could say for me.\" He started to look at himself in the bar\nmirror again, and decided not to. \"By the way,\" he added, as a sudden\nthought struck him. \"Dotty what?\"\n\n\"Now,\" she said. \"There you go doing it.\"\n\n\"Doing what?\"\n\n\"Calling me that name.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"Make it Dorothy. Dorothy what?\" He blinked. \"I mean,\nI know you've got a last name. Dorothy Something. Only it probably isn't\nSomething. What is it?\"\n\n\"Francis,\" she said obligingly. \"Dorothy Francis. My middle name is\nSomething, in case you ever want to call me by my middle name. Just\nyell: 'Hey, Something,' and I'll come a-running. Unless I have something\nelse to do. In which case everything will be very simple: I won't come.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Malone said doubtfully. \"And what do--\"\n\n\"What do I do?\" she said. \"A standard question. Number two of a series.\nI do modeling. Photographic modeling. And that's not all--I also do\ncommercials on 3-D. If I look familiar to you, it's probably because\nyou've seen me on 3-D. Do I look familiar to you?\"\n\n\"I never watch 3-D,\" Malone said, crestfallen.\n\n\"Fine,\" Dorothy said unexpectedly. \"You have excellent taste.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"it's just that I never seem to get the time--\"\n\n\"Don't apologize for it,\" Dorothy said. \"I have to appear on it, but I\ndon't have to like it. And, now that I've answered your questions, how\nabout answering some of mine?\"\n\n\"Gladly,\" Malone said. \"The inmost secrets of the FBI are yours for the\nasking.\"\n\n\"Hm-m-m,\" Dorothy said slowly. \"What do you do as an FBI agent, anyhow?\nDig up spies?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" Malone said. \"We've got enough trouble with the live ones. We\ndon't go around digging anybody up. Believe me.\" He paused, feeling\ndimly that the conversation was beginning to get out of control. \"Have I\ntold you that you are the most beautiful woman I've ever met?\" he said\nat last.\n\n\"No,\" Dorothy said. \"Not yet, anyway. But I was expecting it.\"\n\n\"You were?\" Malone said, disappointed.\n\n\"Certainly,\" Dorothy said. \"You've been drinking. As a matter of fact,\nyou've managed to get quite a head start.\"\n\nMalone hung his head guiltily. \"True,\" he said in a low voice. \"Too\ntrue. Much too true.\"\n\nDorothy nodded, downed her drink and waved to the bartender. \"Wally,\nbring me a double this time.\"\n\n\"A double?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Dorothy said. \"I've got to do some fast catching-up on Mr.\nMalone here.\"\n\n\"Call me Ken,\" Malone muttered.\n\n\"Don't be silly,\" Dorothy told him. \"Wally hardly knows you. He'll call\nyou Mr. Malone, and like it.\"\n\nThe bartender went away and Malone sat on his stool and thought busily\nfor a minute. At last he said: \"If you really want to catch up with\nme--\"\n\n\"Yes?\" Dorothy said.\n\n\"Better have a triple,\" Malone muttered.\n\nDorothy's eyebrows rose slightly.\n\n\"Because I intend to have another one,\" Malone added.\n\n\n\n\nIX.\n\n\nIt started a million years ago.\n\nIn that distant past, a handful of photons deep in the interior of Sol\nbegan their random journey to the photosphere. They had been born as\nultrahard gamma radiation, and they were positively bursting with\nenergy, attempting to push their respective ways through the dense\nnucleonic gas that had been their womb. Within millimicroseconds, they\nhad been swallowed up by the various particles surrounding\nthem--swallowed, and emitted again, as the particles met in violent\ncollision.\n\nAnd then the process was repeated. After a thousand thousand years, and\nbillions on billions of such repetitions, the handful of photons reached\nthe relatively cool photosphere of the sun. But the long battle had\ntaken some of the drive out of them; over the past million years, even\nthe strongest had become only hard ultraviolet, and the weakest just\nsputtered out in the form of long radio waves.\n\nBut now, at last, they were free! And in the first flush of this\nnewfound freedom, they flung themselves over ninety-three million miles\nof space, traveling at one hundred and eighty-six thousand miles a\nsecond and making the entire trip in less than eight and one-half\nminutes.\n\nThey struck the Earth's ionosphere, and their numbers diminished. The\nhard ultraviolet was gobbled up by ozone; much of the blue was scattered\nthrough the atmosphere. The remainder bore steadily onward.\n\nDown through the air they came, only slightly weakened this time. They\nhit the glass of a window in the Hotel New Yorker, losing more of their\nmembers in the plunge.\n\nAnd, a few feet from the glass, they ended their million-year epic by\nilluminating a face.\n\nThe face responded to them with something less than pleasure. It was\nclear that the face did not like being illuminated. It was very bright,\nmuch too bright. It seemed to be searing its way through the face's\nclosed eyelids, right past the optic nerves into the brain-pan itself.\nThe face twisted in a sudden spasm, as if its brain were shriveling with\nheat. Its owner thoughtfully turned over, and the face sought the\nseclusion and comparative darkness of a pillow.\n\nUnfortunately, the motion brought the face's owner to complete\nwakefulness. He did not want to be awake, but he had very little choice\nin the matter. Even though his face was no longer being illuminated, he\ncould feel other rays of sunlight eating at the back of his head. He put\nthe pillow over his head and felt more comfortable for a space, but this\nslight relief passed, too.\n\nHe thought about mausoleums. Mausoleums were nice, cool, dark places\nwhere there was never any sun or heat, and never any reason to wake up.\nMaybe, he told himself, cunningly, if he went to sleep again he would\nwake up dead, in a mausoleum. That, he thought, would be nice.\n\nDeath was nice and pleasant. Unfortunately, he realized, he was not\ndead. And there was absolutely no chance of his ever getting back to\nsleep. He finally rolled over again, being very careful to avoid any\nmore poisonous sunlight. Getting up was an even more difficult process,\nbut Malone knew it had to be managed. Somehow he got his feet firmly\nplanted on the floor and sat up.\n\nIt had been a remarkable feat, he told himself. He deserved a medal.\n\nThat reminded him of the night before. He had been thinking quite a lot\nabout the medals he deserved for various feats. He had even awarded some\nof them to himself, in the shape of liquid decoctions.\n\nHe remembered all that quite well. There were a lot of cloudy things in\nhis mind, but from all the testimony he could gather, he imagined that\nhe'd had quite a time the night before. Quite a wonderful time, as a\nmatter of fact.\n\nNot that that reflection did anything for him now. As he opened his\neyes, one at a time, he thought of Boyd. Once, long ago, ages and ages\nago, he had had to wake Boyd up, and he recalled how rough he had been\nabout it. That had been unforgivable.\n\nHe made a mental note to apologize to Boyd the next time he saw him--if\nhe could ever see again. Now, he knew how Boyd had felt. And it was\nterrible.\n\nStill sitting on the bed, he told himself that, in spite of everything,\nhe was lucky. To judge by his vague memories, he'd had quite a time the\nnight before, and if the hangover was payment for it, then he was\nwilling to accept the payment. Almost. Because it had really been a\nterrific time. The only nagging thought in his mind was that there had\nbeen something vital he'd forgotten.\n\n\"Tickets,\" he said, aloud, and was surprised that his voice was audible.\nAs a matter of fact, it was too audible; the noise made him wince\nslightly. He shifted his position very quietly.\n\nAnd he hadn't forgotten the tickets. No. He distinctly remembered going\nto see \"The Hot Seat,\" and finding seats, and actually sitting through\nthe show with Dorothy at his side. He couldn't honestly say that he\nremembered much of the show itself, but that couldn't be the important\nthing he'd forgotten. By no means.\n\nHe had heard that it was a good show, though. Some time, he reminded\nhimself, he would have to get tickets and actually see it.\n\nHe checked through the evening. Drinks. Dinner ... he had had dinner,\nhadn't he? Yes, he had. He recalled a broiled sea bass looking up at him\nwith mournful eyes. He couldn't have dreamed anything like that.\n\nAnd then the theater, and after that some more drinks ... and so on, and\nso on, and so on, right to his arrival back in his hotel room, at\nfour-thirty in the morning, on a bright, boiled cloud.\n\nHe even remembered arguing with Dorothy about taking her home. She'd won\nthat round by ducking into a subway entrance, and he had turned around\nafter she'd left him and headed for home. Had he taken a taxi?\n\n[Illustration]\n\nYes, Malone decided, he had. He even remembered that.\n\nThen what had he forgotten?\n\nHe had met Dorothy--he told himself, starting all over again in an\neffort to locate the gaps--at six o'clock, right after phoning ...\n\nHe looked at his watch. It was ten o'clock in the morning. He had\ncompletely forgotten to call Fernack and Lynch.\n\nHangover or no hangover, Malone told himself grimly, there was work to\nbe done. Somehow, he managed to get to his feet and start moving.\n\nHe checked Boyd's room after a while. But his partner wasn't home.\n_Probably at work already_, Malone thought, _while I lie here useless\nand helpless_. He thought of a sermon on the Evils of Alcohol, and\ndecided he'd better read it to himself instead of delivering it to Boyd.\n\nBut he didn't waste any time with it. By ten-fifteen he was showered and\nshaved, his teeth were brushed, and he was dressed. He felt, he\nestimated, about fifteen hundred per cent better. That was still lousy,\nbut it wasn't quite as bad as it had been. He could move around and talk\nand even think a little, if he were careful about it. Before he left, he\ntook a look at himself in the mirror.\n\nWell, he told himself, that was nice.\n\nIt hardly showed at all. He looked tired, to be sure, but that was\nalmost normal. The eyes weren't bloodshot red, and didn't seem to bug\nout at all although Malone would have sworn that they were bleeding all\nover his face. His head was its normal size, as near as he remembered;\nit was not swollen visibly, or pulsing like a jellyfish at every move.\n\nHe looked even better than he felt.\n\nHe started for the door, and then stopped himself. There was no need to\ngo out so early; he could start work right in his own hotel room and not\neven have to worry about the streets of New York, the cars or the\npedestrians for a while.\n\nHe thought wistfully about a hair of the hound, decided against it with\ngreat firmness, and sat down to phone.\n\nHe dialed a number, and the face of Commissioner Fernack appeared almost\nat once. Malone forced himself to smile cheerfully, reasonably sure that\nhe was going to crack something as he did it. \"Hello, John Henry,\" he\nsaid in what he hoped was a good imitation of a happy, carefree voice.\n\"And how are you this lovely morning?\"\n\n\"Me?\" Fernack said sourly. \"I'm in great shape. Tiptop. Malone, how did\nyou--\"\n\n\"Any news for me?\" Malone said.\n\nFernack waited a long time before he answered, and when he did his voice\nwas dangerously soft and calm. \"Malone,\" he said, \"when you asked for\nthis survey, just what kind of news did you expect to get anyway?\"\n\n\"An awful lot of impossible crimes,\" Malone said frankly. \"How did I do,\nJohn Henry?\"\n\n\"You did very well,\" Fernack said. \"Too well. Listen, Malone, how could\nyou know about anything like this?\"\n\nMalone blinked. \"Well,\" he said, \"we have our sources. Confidential. Top\nsecret. I'm sure you understand, commissioner.\" Hurriedly, he added:\n\"What does the breakdown look like?\"\n\n\"It looks like hell,\" Fernack said. \"About eight months ago, according\nto the computer, there was a terrific upswing in certain kinds of crime.\nAnd since then it's been pretty steady, right at the top of the swing.\nHasn't moved down hardly at all.\"\n\n\"Great,\" Malone said.\n\nFernack stared. \"What?\" he said.\n\n\"I mean--\" Malone stopped, thought of an answer and tried it: \"I mean,\nthat checks out my guess. My information. Sources.\"\n\nFernack seemed to weigh risks in his mind. \"Malone, I know you're FBI,\"\nhe said at last. \"But this sounds pretty fishy to me. Pretty strange.\"\n\n\"You have no idea how strange,\" Malone said truthfully.\n\n\"I'm beginning to,\" Fernack said. \"And if I ever find out that you had\nanything to do with this--\"\n\n\"Me?\"\n\n\"And don't look innocent,\" Fernack said. \"It doesn't succeed in looking\nanything but horrible. You remind me of a convicted murderer trying to\nsteal thirty cents from the prison chaplain.\"\n\n\"What would I have to do with all these crimes?\" Malone said. \"And what\nkind of crimes were they, anyway?\"\n\n\"What you'd have to do with them,\" Fernack said, \"is an unanswered\nquestion. And so long as it remains unanswered, Malone, you're safe. But\nwhen I come up with enough facts to answer it--\"\n\n\"Don't be silly, commissioner,\" Malone said. \"How about these crimes?\nWhat kind were they?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Burglaries,\" Fernack said. \"And I have a hunch you know that well\nenough. Most of them were just burglaries--locked barrooms, for\ninstance, early in the morning. There's never any sign of tampering with\nthe locks, no sign of breaking and entering, no sign of any alarms being\ntampered with in any way. But the money's gone from the cash register,\nand all of the liquor is gone, too.\"\n\nMalone stared. \"_All_ the liquor?\" he said in a dazed voice.\n\n\"Well,\" Fernack said, \"all of it that's in plain sight, anyway. Except\nfor the open bottles. Disappeared. Gone. Without a trace. And most of\nthe time the extra stock's gone, too, from the basement or wherever they\nhappen to keep it.\"\n\n\"That's a lot of liquor,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Quite a lot,\" Fernack said. \"Some of the bars have gone broke, not\nbeing insured against the losses.\"\n\nThe thought of thousands of bottles of liquor--millions of bottles--went\nthrough Malone's mind like an icepick. He could almost see them, handle\nthem, taste them. \"Hair of the dog,\" he muttered. \"What hair. What a\ndog.\"\n\n\"What did you say, Malone?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" Malone said hastily. \"Nothing at all.\" After a second another\nquery occurred to him. \"You mean to tell me that only bars were robbed?\nNothing else?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" Fernack said. \"Bars are only part of it. Malone, why are you\nasking me to tell you this?\"\n\n\"Because I want to know,\" Malone said patiently.\n\n\"I still think--\" Fernack began, and then said: \"Never mind. But it\nhasn't been only bars. Supermarkets. Homes. Cleaning and tailoring\nshops. Jewelers. Malone, you name it, and it's been hit.\"\n\nMalone tried valiantly to resist temptation, but he was not at his best,\nand he lost. \"All right,\" he said. \"I will name it. Here's a list of\nplaces that haven't even been touched by the rising crime wave: Banks,\nfor one.\"\n\n\"Malone!\"\n\n\"Safes that have been locked, for another,\" Malone went on. \"Homes with\nwall safes--though that's not quite accurate. The homes may have been\nrobbed, but the safes won't have been touched.\"\n\n\"Malone, how much do you know?\" Fernack said.\n\n\"I'll make a general rule for you,\" Malone said. \"Any place that fits\nthe following description is safe: It's got a secure lock on it, and\nit's too small for a human being to get into.\"\n\nFernack opened his mouth, shut it and stared downward, obviously\nscanning some papers lying on the desk in front of him. Malone waited\npatiently for the explosion--but it never came.\n\nInstead, Fernack said: \"You know, Malone, you remind me of an old friend\nof mine.\"\n\n\"Really?\" Malone said pleasantly.\n\n\"You certainly do,\" Fernack said. \"There's just one small difference.\nYou're an FBI man, and he's a crook. If that's a difference.\"\n\n\"It is,\" Malone said. \"And on behalf of the FBI, I resent the\nallegation. And, as a matter of fact, defy the allegator. But that's\nneither here nor there,\" he continued. \"If that's the difference, what\nare the similarities?\"\n\nFernack drew in a deep, hissing breath, and when he spoke his voice was\nas calm and quiet as a coiled cobra. \"The both of you come up with the\ndamnedest answers to things. Things I never knew about or even cared\nabout before. Things I wish I'd never heard of. Things that don't have\nany explanations. And--\" He stopped, his face dark in the screen. Malone\nwondered what color it was going to turn, and decided on purple as a\ngood choice.\n\n\"Well?\" Malone said at last.\n\n\"And you're always so right it makes me sick,\" Fernack finished flatly.\nHe rubbed a hand through his hair and stared into the screen at Malone.\n\"How did you know all this stuff?\" he said.\n\nMalone waited one full second, while Fernack got darker and darker on\nthe screen. When he judged that the color was right, he said quietly:\n\"I'm prescient. And thanks a lot, John Henry; just send the reports to\nme personally, at Sixty-ninth Street. By messenger. So long.\"\n\nHe cut the circuit just as Fernack started: \"Now, Malone--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith a satisfied, somewhat sheepish smile, Malone dialed another number.\nThis time a desk sergeant told him politely that Lynch wasn't at the\nprecinct, and wouldn't arrive until noon.\n\nMalone had Lynch's home number. He dialed it.\n\nIt was a long wait before the lieutenant answered, and he didn't look\nmuch like a police officer when his face finally showed up on the\nscreen. His hair was uncombed and he was unshaven. His eyes were\nslightly bleary, but he was definitely awake.\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"Hello.\"\n\n\"Hi, there,\" Lynch said with enormous cheerfulness. \"Old buddy-boy. Old\npal. Old friend.\"\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Wrong?\" Lynch said. \"Nothing. Nothing. Nothing at all. I just wanted to\nthank you for not waking me up last night. I only waited for your call\nuntil midnight. Then I decided I just wasn't very important to you. You\nobviously had much bigger things on your mind.\"\n\n\"As a matter of fact,\" Malone said, eying Lynch's figure, dressed in a\npair of trousers and a T-shirt, speculatively, \"you're right.\"\n\n\"That's what I thought,\" Lynch said. \"And I decided that, since you were\nso terribly busy, it could wait until I woke up. Or even until I got\ndown to the station. How about it--buddy-boy?\"\n\n\"Listen, Lynch,\" Malone said, \"we made a bet. Ten to one. I just want to\nknow if I can come down to collect or not.\"\n\nThere was a second of silence.\n\n\"All right,\" Lynch said at last, looking crestfallen. \"I owe you a buck.\nEvery last one of those kids has skipped out on us.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Malone said. He wondered briefly just what was good about it,\nand decided he'd rather have lost the money to Lynch. But facts, he\nreflected, were facts. Thoroughly nasty facts.\n\n\"I spent all night tracing them,\" Lynch said. \"Got nowhere. Nowhere at\nall. Tell me, Malone, how did you know--\"\n\n\"Classified,\" Malone said. \"Very classified. But you're sure they're all\ngone? Vanished?\"\n\nLynch's face reddened. \"Sure I'm sure,\" he said. \"Every last one of them\nis gone. And what more do you want me to do about it?\" He paused, then\nadded: \"What do you expect, Malone? Miracles?\"\n\nMalone shook his head gently. \"No,\" he said. \"I--\"\n\n\"Oh, never mind,\" Lynch said.\n\n\"But I--\"\n\n\"Look, Malone,\" Lynch said, \"there's a guy who wants to talk to you.\"\n\n\"One of the Silent Spooks?\" Malone said hopefully.\n\nLynch shook his head and made a growling noise. \"Don't be silly,\" he\nsaid. \"It's just that this guy might have some information--but he won't\nsay anything to me about it. He's a social worker or something like\nthat.\"\n\n\"Social worker?\" Malone said. \"He works with the kids, right?\"\n\n\"I guess,\" Lynch said. \"His name's Kettleman. Albert Kettleman.\"\n\nMalone nodded. \"O.K.,\" he said. \"I'll be right over.\"\n\n\"Hey,\" Lynch said, \"hold on. He's not here now. What do you think this\nis--my house or a reception center?\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" Malone said wearily. \"Where and when?\"\n\n\"How about three o'clock at the precinct station?\" Lynch said, \"I can\nhave him there by then, and you can get together and talk.\" He paused.\n\"Nobody likes the cops,\" he said. \"People hear the FBI's mixed up in\nthis, and they figure the cops are all second-stringers or something.\"\n\n\"Sorry to hear it,\" Malone said.\n\n\"I'll bet you are,\" Lynch told him bitterly.\n\nMalone shrugged. \"Anyway,\" he said, \"I'll see you at three, right?\"\n\n\"Right,\" Lynch said, and Malone flipped off.\n\nHe sat there for a few seconds grinning quietly. His brain throbbed like\nan overheated motor, but he didn't really mind any more. His theory had\nbeen justified, and that was the most important thing.\n\nThe Silent Spooks were all teleports.\n\nEight of them--eight kids on the loose, stealing everything they could\nlay their hands on, and completely safe. How could you catch a boy who\njust disappeared when you started for him? No wonder their names hadn't\nappeared on the police blotter, Malone thought.\n\nThe Spooks didn't get into trouble.\n\nThey didn't have to.\n\nThey could get into any place big enough to hold them, take what they\nwanted and just disappear. They'd been doing it for about eight months,\naccording to the figures Malone had received from Fernack; maybe\nteleportative ability didn't develop until you were around fourteen or\nfifteen.\n\nBut it had developed in these kids--and they were using it in the most\nobvious way. They had a sure method of getting away from the cops, and a\nsure method of taking anything they wanted. No wonder they had so much\nmoney.\n\nMalone got up, feeling slightly dazed, and left the hotel.\n\n\n\n\nX.\n\n\nBy three o'clock, he was again among the living. Maybe his occupations\nhad had something to do with it; he'd spent about four hours supervising\nOperation Dismemberment, and then listening to the reports on the\ndismantled Cadillacs. It was nice, peaceful, unimportant work, but there\njust wasn't anything else to do. FBI work was ninety-five per cent\nmarking time, anyway; Malone felt grateful that there was any action at\nall in what he was doing.\n\nDr. Leibowitz had found all sorts of things in the commandeered\nCaddies--everything from guns and narcotics to pornographic pictures in\nlots of three hundred, for shipment into New York City from the suburbs\nwhere the processing plants probably were. Of course, there had been\npersonal effects, too--maps and lucky dolls and, just once, a single\ncrutch.\n\nMalone wondered about that for quite a while. Who'd just walk off and\nleave one crutch in a car? But people did things like that all the time,\nhe finally told himself heavily. There wasn't any explanation for it,\nand there probably never would be.\n\nBut in spite of the majestic assortment of valuables found in the cars,\nthere was no sign of anything remotely resembling an electro-psionic\nbrain. Dr. Leibowitz had found just about everything--except what he was\nlooking for.\n\nAt a quarter of three, Malone gave up. The search wasn't quite finished,\nbut he'd heard enough to last him for a long time. He grabbed a cab\ndownstairs and went over to Lynch's office to meet Kettleman.\n\nThe \"social worker or something\" was a large, balding man about six feet\ntall. Malone estimated his weight as close to two hundred and fifty\npounds, and he looked every pound of it; his face was round without\nbeing chubby, and his body was stocky and hard. He wore black-rimmed\nglasses, and he was going bald in front. His face was like a mask: it\nwas held in a gentle, almost eager expression that Malone would have\nsworn had nothing to do with the way Kettleman felt underneath.\n\nLynch performed the introductions, escorted the two of them to one of\nthe interrogation rooms at the rear of the station, and left them there,\nwith: \"If either of you guys comes up with anything, let me know,\" for a\nparting shot.\n\nKettleman blinked slowly behind his glasses. \"Mr. Malone,\" he said, \"I\nunderstand that the FBI is interested in one of the ... ah ...\nadolescent social groups with which I work.\"\n\n\"Well, the Silent Spooks,\" Malone said. \"That's right.\"\n\n\"The Spooks,\" Kettleman said. His voice was rather higher than Malone\nwould have expected, oddly breathy without much depth to it. \"My, yes. I\ndid want to talk to somebody about it, and I thought you might be the\nman.\"\n\n\"I'll be interested in anything you have to say,\" Malone said\ndiplomatically. He was beginning to doubt whether he'd get any real\ninformation out of Kettleman. But it was impossible to tell. He sat back\nin a hard wooden chair and tried to look fascinated.\n\n\"Well,\" Kettleman said tentatively, \"the boys themselves have sort of a\nword for it. They'd say that there was something ... ah ... 'oddball'\nabout the Spooks. Do you understand? Not just the fact that they never\ndrink liquor, you understand, but--\"\n\n\"Something strange,\" Malone said. \"Is that what you mean.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Kettleman said. \"_Strange._ Of course.\" He acted, Malone thought,\nas if he had never heard the word before, and was both pleased and\nstartled by its sound. \"Perhaps I had better explain my position a\nlittle more clearly,\" he said. \"That will give you an idea of just where\nI ... ah ... 'fit in' to this picture.\"\n\n\"Whatever you think best,\" Malone said, resigning himself to a very dull\nhour. He tried to picture Kettleman in the midst of a gang of juvenile\ndelinquents. It was very hard to do.\n\n\"I'm a social worker,\" Kettleman said, \"working on an individual basis\nwith these--social groups that the adolescents have formed. It's my job\nto make friends with them, become accepted by them, and try to turn\ntheir hostile impulses toward society into more useful, more acceptable\nchannels.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Malone said, feeling that something was expected of him.\n\"That's fine.\"\n\n\"Oh, we don't expect praise, we social workers,\" Kettleman said\ninstantly. \"The worth of a good job well done, that's enough for us.\" He\nsmiled. The effect was a little unsettling, as if a hippopotamus had\nbegun to laugh like a hyena. \"But to continue, Mr. Malone,\" he said.\n\n\"Of course,\" Malone said. \"Certainly.\"\n\n\"I've worked with many of the organizations in this neighborhood,\"\nKettleman said. \"And I've been quite successful in getting to know\nthem, and in being accepted by them. Of course, the major part of my job\nis more difficult, but ... well, I'm sure that's enough about my own\nbackground. That isn't what you're interested in, now, is it?\"\n\nHe looked penitent. Malone said: \"It's all right. I don't mind.\" He\nshifted positions on the hard chair.\n\n\"Well, then,\" Kettleman said, with the air of a man suddenly getting\ndown to business. He leaned forward eagerly, his eyes big and bright\nbehind the lenses. \"There's something very peculiar about those boys,\"\nhe said in a whisper.\n\n\"Really?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Very peculiar indeed,\" Kettleman said. \"My, yes. All of the other ...\nah ... social groups are afraid of them.\"\n\n\"Big, huh?\" Malone said. \"Big, strong boys who--\"\n\n\"Oh, my no,\" Kettleman said. \"My goodness, no. All of the Spooks are\nrather slight, as a matter of fact. They've got _something,_ but it\nisn't strength.\"\n\n\"My goodness,\" Malone said tiredly.\n\n\"I doubt if--in the language of my own groups--any one of the Spooks\ncould punch his way out of a paper bag,\" Kettleman said. \"It's more than\nthat.\"\n\n\"Frankly,\" Malone said, \"I'm inclined to agree with you. But what is\nthis something that frightens everyone else?\"\n\nKettleman leaned even closer. \"I'm not sure,\" he said softly. \"I can't\nsay for certain, Mr. Malone. I've only heard rumors.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"rumors might--\"\n\n\"Rumors are a very powerful force among my groups, Mr. Malone,\"\nKettleman said. \"I've learned, over the years, to keep my ear to the\nground, as it were, and pay very close attention to rumors.\"\n\n\"I'm sure,\" Malone said patiently. \"But what did this particular rumor\nsay?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Kettleman said, and stopped. \"Well,\" he said again. And at last\nhe gulped and got it out: \"Magicians, Mr. Malone. They say the Spooks\nare magicians--that they can come and go at will. Make themselves\ninvisible. All sorts of things. Of course, I don't believe that, but--\"\n\n\"Oh, it's quite true,\" Malone said, solemn-faced.\n\n\"It's ... what?\"\n\n\"Perfectly true,\" Malone said. \"We've known all that.\"\n\n\"Oh, my,\" Kettleman said. His face took on a whitish cast. \"Oh, my\ngoodness,\" he said. \"Isn't that ... isn't that amazing?\" He swallowed\nhard. \"True all the time,\" he said. \"Magicians. I--\"\n\n\"You see, this information isn't new to us,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Oh,\" Kettleman said. \"No. Of course not. My. It's ... rather\ndisconcerting to think about, isn't it?\"\n\n\"There,\" Malone said, \"I agree with you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKettleman fell silent. Malone offered him a cigarette, but the social\nworker refused with a pale smile, and Malone lit one for himself. He\ntook a couple of puffs in the silence, and then Kettleman said: \"Well,\nMr. Malone, Lieutenant Lynch did say that I was to tell you everything I\ncould about these boys.\"\n\n\"I'm sure we all appreciate that,\" Malone said at random, wondering\nexactly what he meant.\n\n\"There is ... well, there is one more thing,\" Kettleman said.\n\"Ordinarily, of course, I wouldn't say anything about this to anyone. In\nmy line of work, Mr. Malone, you learn the need for confidence. For\nbeing able to keep one's word.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" Malone said, wondering what startling new fact was on its\nway now.\n\n\"And we certainly try to keep the confidence of the boys,\" Kettleman\nsaid maddeningly. \"We wouldn't betray them to the police in any way\nunless it were absolutely necessary.\"\n\n\"Betray them--? Mr. Kettleman,\" Malone said, \"just what are you trying\nto tell me?\"\n\n\"It's about their meeting place,\" Kettleman said. \"Oh, my. I'm not at\nall sure I ought to tell you this.\" He wrung his pale fat hands together\nand looked at Malone appealingly.\n\n\"Now, now,\" Malone said, feeling foolish. \"It's perfectly all right. We\ndon't want to hurt the Spooks. Not any more than we have to. You can\ntell me, Mr. Kettleman.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Kettleman said. \"Well. I--The Spooks do have a sort of secret\nmeeting place, you know. And they meet there.\"\n\nHe stopped. Malone said: \"Where is it?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's a big empty warehouse,\" Kettleman said. \"I really feel\nterrible about this. They're meeting there tonight some time, or that's\nwhat the rumors say. I shouldn't be telling you--\"\n\n\"Of course you should,\" Malone said, trying to sound reassuring. \"Don't\nworry about a thing, Mr. Kettleman. Tonight?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Kettleman said eagerly. He grinned and then looked\nmorosely down at his hands.\n\n\"Do you know where this warehouse is?\" Malone said. \"If any of the other\nlittle social groups use it--\"\n\n\"Oh, no, they don't,\" Kettleman said. \"That's what makes it so funny.\nYou see, the warehouse is deserted, but it's kept in good repair; there\nare bars on the windows, and it's protected by all sorts of alarm\nsystems and things like that. So none of the others can use it. Only the\nSpooks. You can't get in without a key, not at all.\"\n\n\"But do the Spooks--\" Malone began.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" Kettleman moaned. \"They don't have a key. At least, that's\nwhat the other ... social groups say. The Spooks just ... just melt\nthrough the walls, or something like that.\"\n\n\"Mr. Kettleman,\" Malone said, \"where is this warehouse?\"\n\n\"I shouldn't be telling you this,\" Kettleman said.\n\nMalone sighed. \"Please. Mr. Kettleman. You know we're working for the\ngood of those boys, don't you?\"\n\n\"Well, I--\"\n\n\"Sure we are,\" Malone said. \"So you can tell me.\"\n\nKettleman blinked behind his glasses, and moaned a little. Malone waited\nwith his hands tense in his lap. At last Kettleman said: \"It's on West\nStreet, near Chambers. That's downtown.\" He gave Malone an address.\n\"That's where it is,\" he said. \"But you won't ... do anything to the\nboys, will you? They're basically good boys. No matter what. And they--\"\n\n\"Don't worry about it, Mr. Kettleman,\" Malone said. \"We'll take care of\nthe Spooks.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Kettleman said. \"Yes. Sure.\"\n\nHe got up. Malone said: \"There's just one more thing, Mr. Kettleman.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" The big man's voice had reached the high, breathy pitch of a\nfife.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Do you have any idea what time the Spooks usually meet?\"\n\n\"Well, now,\" Kettleman said, \"I don't really know. You see, the reason I\nwanted to tell you all this was because Lieutenant Lynch was checking up\non all those boys yesterday, and I thought--\" He stopped and cleared his\nthroat, and when he began again his voice had dropped almost to a\nwhisper: \"Well, Mr. Malone, I thought, after all, that since he was\nasking me questions ... you know, questions about where they were, the\nSpooks I mean, and all of that ... since he was asking me questions--\"\n\n\"Yes?\" Malone said.\n\n\"I thought perhaps I ought to tell you about them,\" Kettleman said.\n\"Where they were, and all of that.\"\n\nMalone stood up. \"Mr. Kettleman,\" he said in his most official voice, \"I\nwant you to know that the FBI appreciates what you've done. Your\ninformation will probably be very helpful to us, and the FBI certainly\ncommends you for being public-spirited enough to come to us and tell us\nwhat you know.\" He thought for a second, and then added: \"In the name of\nthe FBI, Mr. Kettleman--well done!\"\n\nKettleman stared, smiled and gulped. \"My goodness,\" he said \"Well.\" He\nsmiled again, a little more broadly. \"One has one's duty, you know. My,\nyes. Duty.\" He nodded to Malone.\n\n\"Of course,\" Malone said, going to the door and opening it. \"Thanks\nagain, Mr. Kettleman.\"\n\nKettleman saw the open door and headed for it blindly. As he left he\nflashed one last smile after Malone, who sighed, shut the door and\nleaned against it for a second.\n\nThe things an FBI agent had to go through!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen he had recovered, he opened the door again and peered carefully\ndown the hallway to make sure Kettleman had gone. Then he left the\ninterrogation room and went down the hall, past the desk sergeant, and\nup the stairs to Lieutenant Lynch's office. He was still breathing a\nlittle hard when he opened Lynch's door, and Lynch didn't seem to be\nexpecting him at all. He was very busy with a veritable snow flurry of\npapers, and he looked as if he had been involved with them steadily ever\nsince he had left Malone and Kettleman alone downstairs.\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said. \"Hello there, lieutenant.\"\n\nLynch looked up, his face a mask of surprise. \"Oh,\" he said. \"It's you.\nThrough with Kettleman?\"\n\n\"I'm through,\" Malone said. \"As if you didn't know.\" He looked at Lynch\nfor a long minute, and then said: \"Lieutenant--\"\n\nLynch had gone right back to his papers. He looked up again with a bland\nexpression. \"Yes?\"\n\n\"Lieutenant, how reliable is Kettleman?\" Malone said.\n\nLynch shrugged. \"He's always been pretty good with the kids, if that's\nwhat you mean. You know these social workers--I've never got much\ninformation out of him. He feels it's his duty to the kids ... I don't\nknow. Some such thing. Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"what he told me. Was he kidding me? Or does he\nknow what he's talking about? Was what he said reasonably accurate?\"\n\n\"How would I know?\" Lynch said. \"After all, you were down there alone,\nweren't you? I was up here, working. If you'll tell me what he said,\nmaybe I'll be able to tell you whether or not I think he was kidding.\nBut--\"\n\nMalone placed both his palms on the lieutenant's desk, mashing a couple\nof piles of papers. He leaned forward slowly, his eyes on Lynch's bland,\ninnocent face. \"Now look, Lynch,\" he said. \"I like you. I really do.\nYou're a good cop. You get things done.\"\n\n\"Well, thanks,\" Lynch said. \"But I don't see what this has to do with--\"\n\n\"I just don't want you trying to kid your buddy-boy,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Kid you?\" Lynch said. \"I don't get it.\"\n\n\"Come on, now,\" Malone said. \"I know that room was bugged, just as well\nas you do. It was the sensible thing for you to pull, and you pulled it.\nYou've got the whole thing recorded, haven't you?\"\n\n\"Me?\" Lynch said. \"Why would I--\"\n\n\"Oh, cut it out,\" Malone said impatiently. \"Let's not play games, O.K.?\"\n\nThere was a second of silence.\n\n\"All right,\" Lynch said. \"So I recorded the conversation. Kill me.\nCrucify me. I'm stealing FBI secrets. I'm a spy secretly working for a\nforeign power. Take me out and electrocute me.\"\n\n\"I don't want to fight you,\" Malone said wearily. \"So you've got the\nstuff recorded. That's your business.\"\n\n\"My business?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said cheerfully, \"as long as you don't try to use it.\"\n\n\"Now, Malone--\" Lynch began.\n\n\"This is touchy stuff,\" Malone said. \"We're going to have to take a lot\nof care in handling it. And I don't want you throwing raids all over the\nplace and mixing everything up.\"\n\n\"Malone, I--\"\n\n\"Eventually,\" Malone said, \"I'm going to need your help with these kids.\nBut for right now, I want to handle this my way, without any\ninterference.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't think of--\"\n\n\"You wanted information,\" Malone said. \"Fine. That's all right with me.\nYou got the information, and that's O.K., too. But if you try to use it\nbefore I say the word, I'll ... I'll talk to good old Uncle John Henry\nFernack. And he'll help me out: he'll give you a refresher course on\n_How To Be A Beat Cop_. In Kew Gardens. It's nice and lonely out there\nnow, Lynch. You'd love it.\"\n\n\"Malone,\" Lynch said tiredly.\n\n\"Don't give me any arguments,\" Malone said. \"I don't want any\narguments.\"\n\n\"I won't argue with you, Malone,\" Lynch said. \"I've been trying to tell\nyou something.\"\n\nMalone stepped away from the desk. \"All right,\" he said. \"Go ahead.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLynch took a deep breath. \"Malone, I'm not trying to queer your pitch,\"\nhe said. \"If I were going to pull a raid, here's what I'd have to do:\nget my own cops together, then call the precinct that covers that old\nwarehouse. We don't cover the warehouse from here, Malone, and we'd need\nthe responsible precinct's aid in anything we did down there.\"\n\nMalone said: \"Well, all I--\"\n\n\"Not only that,\" Lynch said. \"I'd have to call Safe and Loft, and get\nthem in on it. A warehouse raid would probably be their baby first of\nall. That means this precinct, the warehouse precinct, and the Safe and\nLoft Squad, all together to raid that warehouse. Malone, would I pull a\nraid at this stage, if I had to go through all that, without knowing\nwhat I was going to find down there?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said.\n\n\"If those kids can just appear and disappear at will,\" Lynch said, \"I'm\nnot going to pull a raid on them, and end up looking like a fool, until\nI've got some way of making sure they're there when the raid goes\nthrough.\"\n\nMalone coughed gently. \"O.K.,\" he said at last. \"Sorry.\"\n\n\"There's only one thing I want,\" Lynch said. \"I want to be able to move\nas soon as possible.\"\n\n\"Well, sure,\" Malone said apologetically.\n\n\"And that means I'm going to have to be informed,\" Lynch said. \"I want\nto know what's going on, as fast as possible.\"\n\nMalone nodded gently. \"Sure,\" he said. \"I'll tell you everything that\nhappens--as soon as I know myself. But right now, I haven't got a thing\nfor you. All I have is a kind of theory, and it's pretty screwy.\"\n\nHe stopped. Lynch looked up at him. \"Just how screwy can it get?\" he\nsaid. \"The facts are nutty enough.\"\n\n\"You have absolutely no idea,\" Malone assured him. \"I'm not even saying\na word about this, not until I prove it out one way or another. I'm not\neven thinking about it. I don't even want me to know about it, until it\nstops sounding so nutty to me.\"\n\n\"O.K., Malone,\" Lynch said. \"I can see a piece of it, if no more. The\nFueyo kid vanishes mysteriously--never mind all that about you getting\nhim out of the interrogation room by some kind of confidential method.\nThere isn't any confidential method. I know that better than you do.\"\n\n\"I had to say something, didn't I?\" Malone asked apologetically.\n\n\"So the kid disappears,\" Lynch said, brushing Malone's question away\nwith a wave of his hand. \"So now I hear all this stuff from Kettleman.\nAnd it begins to add up. The kids can disappear somehow, and re-appear\nsome place else. Walk through walls?\" He shrugged. \"How should I know?\nBut they can sure do something like it.\"\n\n\"Something,\" Malone said. \"Like I said, it sounds screwy.\"\n\n\"I don't like it,\" Lynch said.\n\nMalone nodded. \"Nobody likes it,\" he said. \"But keep it under your hat.\nI'll give you everything I have--whenever I have anything. And ... by\nthe way--\"\n\n\"Yes?\" Lynch said.\n\n\"Thanks for giving me and Kettleman a chance to talk,\" Malone said.\n\"Even if you had reasons of your own.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Lynch said. \"You mean the recording.\"\n\n\"I was a little suspicious,\" Malone said. \"I didn't think you'd give\nKettleman to me without getting _something_ for yourself.\"\n\n\"Would you?\" Lynch said.\n\nMalone shrugged. \"I'm not crazy either,\" he said.\n\nLynch picked up a handful of papers. \"I've got all this work to do,\" he\nsaid. \"So I'll see you later.\"\n\n\"O.K.,\" Malone said.\n\n\"And if you need my help, buddy-boy,\" Lynch said, \"just yell--right?\"\n\n\"I'll yell,\" Malone said. \"Don't worry about that. I'll yell loud enough\nto get myself heard in Space Station One.\"\n\n\n\n\nXI.\n\n\nThe afternoon was bright and sunny, but it didn't match Malone's mood.\nHe got a cab outside the precinct station and headed for Sixty-ninth\nStreet, dining off his nails en route. When he hit the FBI Headquarters,\nhe called Washington and got Burris on the line.\n\nHe made a full report to the FBI chief, including his wild theory and\neverything else that had happened. \"And there was this notebook,\" he\nsaid, and reached into his jacket pocket for it.\n\nThe pocket was empty.\n\n\"What notebook?\" Burris said.\n\nMalone tried to remember if he'd left the book in his room. He couldn't\nquite recall. \"This book I picked up,\" he said, and described it. \"I'll\nsend it on, or bring it in when the case is over.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Burris said.\n\nMalone went on with his description of what had happened. When he'd\nfinished, Burris heaved a great sigh.\n\n\"My goodness,\" he said. \"Last year it was telepathic spies, and this\nyear it's teleporting thieves. Malone, I hate to think about next year.\"\n\n\"I wish you hadn't said that,\" Malone said sadly.\n\nBurris blinked. \"Why?\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, just because,\" Malone said. \"I haven't even had time to think about\nnext year, yet. But I'll think about it now.\"\n\n\"Well, maybe it won't be so bad,\" Burris said.\n\nMalone shook his head. \"No, chief,\" he said. \"You're wrong. It'll be\nworse.\"\n\n\"This is bad enough,\" Burris said.\n\n\"It's a great vacation,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Please,\" Burris said. \"Did I have any idea--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Malone said.\n\nBurris' eyes closed. \"All right, Malone,\" he said after a little pause.\n\"Let's get back to the report. At least it explains the red Cadillac\nbusiness. Sergeant Jukovsky was hit by a boy who vanished.\"\n\n\"I was hit by a boy who vanished, too,\" Malone said bitterly. \"But, of\ncourse, I'm just an FBI agent. Expendable. Nobody cares about--\"\n\n\"Don't say that, Malone,\" Burris said. \"You're one of my most valuable\nagents.\"\n\nMalone tried to stop himself from beaming, but he couldn't. \"Well,\nchief,\" he began, \"I--\"\n\n\"Vanishing boys,\" Burris muttered. \"What are you going to do with them,\nMalone?\"\n\n\"I was hoping you might have some kind of suggestion,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Me?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"I suppose I'll figure it out--when I catch them.\nBut I did want something from you, chief.\"\n\n\"Anything, Malone,\" Burris said. \"Anything at all.\"\n\n\"I want you to get hold of Dr. O'Connor, out at Yucca Flats, if you can.\nHe's the best psionics man Westinghouse has right now, and I might need\nhim.\"\n\n\"If you say so,\" Burris said doubtfully.\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"these kids are teleports. And maybe there's some\nway to stop a teleport. Give him a good, hard kick in the psi, for\ninstance.\"\n\n\"In the what?\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" Malone said savagely. \"But if I'm going to get any\ninformation on what makes teleports tick, I'm going to have to get it\nfrom Dr. O'Connor--right?\"\n\n\"Right,\" Burris said.\n\n\"So get in touch with Dr. O'Connor,\" Malone said.\n\n\"I'll have him call you,\" Burris said. \"Meanwhile ... well, meanwhile\njust carry on, Malone. I've got every confidence in you.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Malone growled.\n\n\"If anybody can crack a case like this,\" Burris said, \"it's you.\"\n\n\"I suppose it had better be,\" Malone said, and rang off.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen he started to think. The notebook wasn't in his pockets. He checked\nevery one, even the jacket pocket where he usually kept a handkerchief\nand nothing else. It wasn't anywhere on his person.\n\nHad he left it in his room?\n\nHe thought about that for several minutes, and finally decided that he\nhadn't. He hadn't taken it out of his pocket, for one thing, and if it\nhad fallen to the ground he couldn't have helped seeing it. Of course,\nhe'd put his wallet, keys, change and other such items on the dresser,\nand then replaced them in his pockets when morning had come--but he\ncould remember how they'd looked on the dresser.\n\nThe notebook hadn't been there among them.\n\nNow that he came to think of it, when had he seen the notebook last?\nHe'd shown it to Lieutenant Lynch during the afternoon, and then he'd\nput it back in his pocket, and he hadn't looked for it again.\n\nSo it had to be somewhere in one of the bars he'd visited, or at the\ntheater where he and Dorothy had seen \"The Hot Seat.\"\n\nProud of himself for this careful and complete job of deduction, he\nstrolled out and, giving Boyd and the Agent-in-Charge one small smile\neach, to remember him by, he went into the sunlight trying to decide\nwhich place to check first. He settled on the theater because it was\nmost probable: after all, people were always losing things in theaters.\nBesides, if he started at the theater, and found the notebook there, he\ncould then go on to a bar to celebrate. If he found the notebook in a\nbar, he didn't much relish the idea of going on to an empty theater in\nthe middle of the afternoon to celebrate getting the book back.\n\nShaking his head over this flimsy structure of logic, he headed down to\n\"The Hot Seat.\" He banged on the lobby doors for a while without any\ngood result, and finally leaned against one of the side doors, which\nopened. Malone fell through, recovered his balance and found himself\nfacing an old, bewhiskered man with a dustpan, a broom and a surprised\nexpression.\n\n\"I'm looking for a notebook,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Try a stationery store, youngster,\" the old man said. \"I thought I'd\nheard 'em all, but--\"\n\n\"No,\" Malone said. \"You don't understand.\"\n\n\"I don't have to understand,\" the old man said. \"That's what's so\nrestful about this here job. I just got to sweep up. I don't have to\nunderstand nothing. Good-by.\"\n\n\"I'm looking for a notebook I lost here last night,\" Malone said\ndesperately.\n\n\"Oh,\" the old man said. \"Lost and Found. That's different. You come with\nme.\"\n\nThe old man led Malone in silence to a cave deep in the bowels of the\ntheater, where he went behind a little desk, took up a pencil as if it\nwere a club, held it poised over a sheet of grimy paper, and said:\n\"Name?\"\n\nMalone said: \"I just want to find a notebook.\"\n\n\"Got to give me your name, youngster,\" the old man said solemnly. \"It's\nthe rules here. After all.\"\n\nMalone sighed: \"Kenneth Malone,\" he said. \"And my address is--\"\n\nThe old man, fiercely scribbling, looked up. \"Wait a minute, can't you?\"\nhe said. \"I ain't through 'Kenneth' yet.\" He wrote on, and finally said:\n\"Address?\"\n\n\"Statler Hilton Hotel,\" Malone said.\n\n\"In Manhattan?\" the old man said.\n\n\"That's right,\" Malone said wearily.\n\n\"Ah,\" the old man said. \"Tourist, ain't you? Tourists is always losing\nthings. Once it was a big dog. Don't know yet how a dog got into this\nhere theater. Had to feed it for four days before somebody showed up to\nclaim it. Fierce-looking animal. Part bloodhound, part water spaniel.\"\n\nFascinated in spite of himself, Malone said: \"That's impossible.\"\n\n\"Nothing's impossible,\" the old man said. \"Work for a theater long\nenough and you find that out. Part bloodhound, I said, and part water\nspaniel. Should have seen that dog before you start talking about\nimpossibilities. What a strange-looking beast. And then there was the\ntime--\"\n\n\"About the notebook,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Notebook?\" the old man said.\n\n\"I lost a notebook,\" Malone said. \"I was hoping that--\"\n\n\"Description?\" the old man said, and poised his pencil again.\n\nMalone heaved a great sigh. \"Black plastic,\" he said. \"About so big.\" He\nmade motions with his hands. \"No names or initials on it. But the first\npage had my name written on it, along with Lieutenant Peter Lynch.\"\n\n\"Who's he?\" the old man said.\n\n\"He's a cop,\" Malone said.\n\n\"My, my,\" the old man said. \"Valuable notebook, with a cop's name in it\nand all. You a cop, youngster?\"\n\nMalone shook his head.\n\n\"Too bad,\" the old man said obscurely. \"I like cops.\" He stood up. \"You\nsaid black plastic? Black?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Malone said. \"Do you have it here?\"\n\n\"Got no notebooks at all here, youngster,\" the old man said. \"Empty\nbillfold, three hats, a couple of coats and some pencils. And an\numbrella. No dogs tonight, youngster, _and_ no notebooks.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"Well ... wait a minute.\"\n\n\"What is it, youngster?\" the old man said. \"I'm busy this time of day.\nGot to sweep and clean. Got work to do. Not like you tourists.\"\n\nWith difficulty, Malone leashed his temper. \"Why did I have to describe\nthe notebook?\" he said. \"You haven't got any notebooks at all.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" the old man said cheerfully.\n\n\"But you made me describe--\"\n\n\"That's the rules,\" the old man said. \"And I ain't about to go against\nthe rules. Not for no tourist.\" He put the pencil down and rose. \"Wish\nyou were a cop,\" he said. \"I never met a cop. They don't lose things\nlike people do.\"\n\nMaking a mental note to call up later and talk to the manager, if the\nnotebook hadn't turned up in the meantime, Malone went off to find the\nbars he had stopped in before the theater.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSaving Topp's for last, he started at the Ad Lib, where a surprised bald\nman told him they hadn't found a notebook anywhere in the bar for\nsomething like six weeks. \"Now if you'd been looking for umbrellas,\" he\nsaid, \"we could have accommodated you. Got over ten umbrellas\ndownstairs, waiting for their owners. I wonder why people lose so many\numbrellas?\"\n\n\"Maybe they hate rain,\" Malone said.\n\n\"I don't know,\" the bald man said. \"I'm sort of a psychologist--you\nknow, a judge of people. I think it's an unconscious protest against the\nfetters of a society which is slowly strangling them by--\"\n\nMalone said good-by in a hurry and left. His next stop was the Xochitl,\nthe Mexican bar on Forty-sixth Street. He greeted the bartender warmly.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Ah,\" the bartender told him. \"You come back. We look for you.\"\n\n\"Look for me?\" Malone said. \"You mean you found my notebook?\"\n\n\"Notesbook?\" the bartender said.\n\n\"A little black plastic book,\" Malone said, making motions, \"about so\nbig. And it----\"\n\n\"Not find,\" the bartender said. \"You lose him?\"\n\n\"Sure I lost him,\" Malone said. \"I mean, _it_. Would I be looking for it\nif I hadn't lost it?\"\n\n\"Who knows?\" the bartender said, and shrugged.\n\n\"But you said you were looking for me,\" Malone said. \"What about?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" the bartender said. \"I only say that. Make customer feel good,\nthink we miss him. Customers like, so we do. What your name?\"\n\n\"Pizarro,\" Malone said disgustedly, and went away.\n\nThe last stop was Topp's. Well, he had to find the notebook there. It\nwas the only place the notebook could be. That was logic, and Malone was\nproud of it. He walked into Topp's trying to remember the bartender's\nname, and found it just as he walked into the bar.\n\n\"Hello, Wally,\" he said gaily.\n\nThe bartender stared at him. \"I'm not Wally,\" he said. \"Wally's the\nother barman. My name's Ray.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said, feeling deflated. \"Well, I've come about a\nnotebook.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir?\" Ray said.\n\n\"I lost the notebook here yesterday evening, between six and eight. If\nyou'll just take me to the Lost and Found department--\"\n\n\"One moment, sir,\" Ray said, and left him standing at the bar, all\nalone.\n\nIn a few seconds he was back. \"I didn't see the notebook myself, sir,\"\nhe said. \"But if Wally picked it up, he'd have turned it over to the\n_ma\u00eetre d'_. Perhaps you'd like to check with him.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. The _ma\u00eetre d'_ turned out to be a shortish,\nheavy-set man with large blue eyes, a silver mane and a thin,\npencil-line mustache. He was addressed, for no reason Malone was able to\ndiscover, as BeeBee.\n\nRay introduced them. \"This gentleman wants to know about a notebook,\" he\ntold BeeBee.\n\n\"Notebook?\" BeeBee said.\n\nMalone explained at length. BeeBee nodded in an understanding fashion\nfor some moments and, when Malone had finished, disappeared in search of\nthe Lost and Found. He came back rather quickly, with the disturbing\nnews that no notebook was anywhere in the place.\n\n\"It's got to be here,\" Malone insisted.\n\n\"Well,\" BeeBee said, \"it isn't. Maybe you left it some place else. Maybe\nit's home now.\"\n\n\"It isn't,\" Malone said. \"And I've tried every place else.\"\n\n\"New York's a big city, Mr. Malone,\" BeeBee said.\n\nMalone sighed. \"I've tried every place I've been. The notebook couldn't\nbe somewhere I haven't been. A rolling stone follows its owner.\" He\nthought about that. It didn't seem to mean anything, but maybe it had\nonce. There was no way to tell for sure.\n\nHe went back to the bar to think things over and figure out his next\nmove. A bourbon-and-soda while thinking seemed the obvious order, and\nRay bustled off to get it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHad he left the notebook on the street somewhere, just dropping it by\naccident? Malone couldn't quite see that happening. It was, of course,\npossible--but the possibility was so remote that he decided to try and\nthink of everything else first. There was Dorothy, for instance.\n\nWas it possible that she might have the book?\n\nIt was. But, if so, how had she got it?\n\nMalone enumerated possibilities on his fingers. First, he could have\ndropped it or something like that, and she could have picked it up. But\ndropping the notebook was a chance he'd eliminated already. It just\ndidn't sound likely.\n\nBesides, if he were going to work on the dropping hypothesis, he might\nas well start from anywhere, on the assumption that he had dropped it\nanywhere on the street.\n\nBut if he _had_ dropped it--second finger--and Dorothy had picked it\nup, wouldn't she have given it back?\n\nShe would have, Malone decided, unless she actually intended to steal\nit.\n\nAnd if she had intended to steal it, she could just as easily have\nlifted it out of his pocket in the first place. She didn't need to wait\nfor it to fall out conveniently, all by itself.\n\nThird finger: why would she steal the notebook? What good was it to her?\nAnd how did she even know he had it?\n\nNone of those questions seemed to have any answers. Of course, if she'd\nbeen connected with the Silent Spooks in some way, it would explain a\nlittle--but somehow Malone couldn't see Dorothy as a Silent Spook.\n\nMalone stared at his ring finger and pinky. He pressed the ring finger\ndown, thinking that perhaps Dorothy had picked the notebook up and just\nforgotten to give it back. That was possible, even if not likely.\n\nOnly it required that notebook dropping out again.\n\nThe pinky went down. She might be some sort of a kleptomaniac, Malone\nthought.\n\nThat didn't look very probable.\n\nNo, Malone decided, realizing that he had no more fingers left, it was\nimpossible to shake off the feeling that the girl had deliberately taken\nthe book for some definite purpose of her own.\n\nHe decided to give her a call.\n\nHe took the drink from Ray and slid off the bar stool. Two steps away he\nremembered one more little fact.\n\nHe didn't have her number, and he didn't know anything about where she\nlived, except that it could be reached by subway. That, Malone told\nhimself morosely, limited things nicely to the five boroughs of New\nYork.\n\nAnd she'd said she was living with her aunt. Would she have a phone\nlisting under her own name, or would the listing be under her aunt's\nname--which he also didn't know?\n\nAt any rate, he could check listings under Dorothy Francis, he told\nhimself.\n\nHe did so.\n\nThere were lots and lots of people named Dorothy Francis, in Manhattan\nand in all the other boroughs.\n\nMalone frowned thoughtfully. _I wish somebody would tell me how to get\nin touch with her_, he thought. _She might know more about that book\nthan I do._\n\nThe thought bothered him. But, to offset it, there was a nice new\nfeeling growing at the back of his mind.\n\nHe felt as if he were going to know the answer soon enough.\n\nHe felt as if he were going to be lucky again.\n\nIn the meantime, he went back to the bar to think some more. He was on\nhis second bourbon-and-soda, still thinking but without any new ideas,\nwhen BeeBee tapped him gently on the shoulder.\n\n\"Pardon me,\" the _ma\u00eetre d'_ said, \"but are you English?\"\n\n\"Am I what?\" Malone said, spilling a little of his drink on the bar.\n\n\"Are you English?\" BeeBee inquired.\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"No. Irish. Very Irish.\"\n\n\"That's nice,\" BeeBee said.\n\nMalone stared at him. \"I think it's fine,\" he said, \"but I'd love to\nknow why you asked me.\"\n\n\"Well,\" BeeBee said, \"I knew you couldn't be American. Not after the\nphone call. You don't have to hide your nationality here; we're quite\naccustomed to foreign visitors. And we don't have special prices for\ntourists.\"\n\nMalone waited two breaths. \"Will you please tell me,\" he said slowly,\n\"what it is you're talking about?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" BeeBee said with aplomb. \"There's a call for you in the\nupstairs booth. A long-distance call, personal.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"Who'd know I was--\" He stopped, thinking hard. There\nwas no way in the world for anyone to know he was in Topp's. Therefore,\nnobody could be calling him. \"They've got the wrong name,\" he said\ndecisively.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" BeeBee said. \"I heard them quite distinctly. You _are_ Sir\nKenneth Malone, aren't you?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMalone gaped for one long second, and then his mind caught up with the\nfacts. \"Oh,\" he said. \"Sure.\" He raced upstairs to the phone booth,\nsaid: \"This is Sir Kenneth Malone,\" into the blank screen, and waited\npatiently.\n\nAfter a while an operator said: \"Person to person call, Sir Kenneth,\nfrom Yucca Flats. Will you take this call?\"\n\n\"I'll take it,\" Malone said. A face appeared on the screen, and Malone\nknew he was right. He knew exactly how he'd been located, and by whom.\n\nLooking at the face in the screen alone, it might have been thought that\nthe woman who appeared there was somebody's grandmother, kindly,\nred-cheeked and twinkle-eyed. Perhaps that wasn't the only stereotype;\nshe could have been an old-maid schoolteacher, one of the kindly\nschoolteachers who taught, once upon a time that never was, in the\nlittle old red schoolhouses of the dim past. The face positively\nradiated kindliness, and friendship, and peace.\n\nBut if the face was the face of a sentimental dream, the garb was the\ngarb of royalty. Somebody's grandmother was on her way to a costume\nparty. She wore the full court costume of the days of Queen Elizabeth I,\ncomplete with brocaded velvet gown, wide ruff collar and bejeweled\nskullcap.\n\nShe was, Malone knew, completely insane.\n\nLike all the other telepaths Malone and the rest of the FBI had found\nduring their work in uncovering a telepathic spy, she had been located\nin an insane asylum. Months of extensive psychotherapy, including all\nthe newest techniques and some so old that psychiatrists were a little\nafraid to use them, had done absolutely nothing to shake the firmest\nconviction in the mind of Miss Rose Thompson.\n\nShe was, she insisted, Elizabeth Tudor, rightful Queen of England.\n\nShe claimed she was immortal--which was not true. She also claimed to be\na telepath. This was perfectly accurate. It had been her help that had\nenabled Malone to find the telepathic spy, and a grateful government had\nrewarded her.\n\nIt had given her a special expense allotment for life, covering the\nclothing she wore, and the style in which she lived. Rooms had been set\naside for her at Yucca Flats, and she held court there, sometimes being\ntreated by psychiatrists and sometimes helping Dr. Thomas O'Connor in\nhis experiments and in the development of new psionic machines.\n\nShe was probably the happiest psychotic on Earth.\n\nMalone stared at her. For a second he could think of nothing to say but:\n\"My God.\" He said it.\n\n\"Not at all, Sir Kenneth,\" the little old lady said. \"Your Queen.\"\n\nMalone took a deep breath. \"Good afternoon, Your Majesty,\" he said.\n\n\"Good afternoon, Sir Kenneth,\" she said, and waited. After a second\nMalone figured out what she was waiting for.\n\nHe inclined his head in as courtly a bow as he could manage over a\nvisiphone. \"I am deeply honored,\" he said, \"that Your Majesty has called\non me. Is there any way in which I might be of service?\"\n\n\"Oh, goodness me, no,\" said the little old lady. \"I don't need a thing.\nThey do one very well here in Yucca Flats. You must come out soon and\nsee my new throne room. I've had the decorations done by ... but I can\nsee you're not interested in that, Sir Kenneth.\"\n\n\"But--\" Malone realized it was useless to argue with the old lady. She\nwas telepathic, and knew exactly what he was thinking. That, after all,\nwas how he had been located; she had mentally \"hunted\" for him until she\nfound him.\n\nBut why?\n\n\"I'll tell you why, Sir Kenneth,\" the little old lady said. \"I'm worried\nabout you.\"\n\n\"Worried? About me, Your Majesty?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" the little old lady said, inclining her head just the\nproper number of degrees, and raising it again. \"You, Sir Kenneth, and\nthat silly little notebook you lost. You've been stewing about it for\nthe last hour.\"\n\nIt was obvious that, for reasons of her own, the Queen had seen fit to\nlook into Malone's mind. She'd found him worrying, and called him about\nit. It was, Malone thought, sweet of her in a way. But it was also just\na bit disconcerting.\n\nHe was perfectly well aware that the Queen could read his mind at any\ndistance. But unless something reminded him of the fact, he didn't have\nto think about it.\n\nAnd he didn't like to think about it.\n\n\"Don't be disturbed,\" the Queen said. \"Please. I only want to help you,\nSir Kenneth; you know that.\"\n\n\"Well, of course I do,\" Malone said. \"But--\"\n\n\"Heavens to Betsy,\" she said. \"Sir Kenneth, what kind of a detective are\nyou?\"\n\n\"What?\" Malone said, and added at once: \"Your Majesty.\" He knew\nperfectly well, of course, that Miss Thompson was not Queen Elizabeth\nI--and he knew that Miss Thompson knew what he thought.\n\nBut she didn't mind. Politeness, she held, was the act of being pleasant\non the surface, no matter what a person really thought. People were\npolite to their bosses, she pointed out, even though they were perfectly\nsure that they could do a better job than the bosses were doing.\n\nSo she insisted on the surface pretense that Malone was going through,\ntreating her like a Queen.\n\nThe psychiatrists had called her delusion a beautifully rationalized\none. As far as Malone was concerned, it made more sense than most of\nreal life.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"That's very nice of you, Sir Kenneth,\" the Queen said. \"But I want to\nask you again: what kind of detective are you? Haven't you got any\ncommon sense at all?\"\n\nMalone hated to admit it, but he had always had just that suspicion.\nAfter all, he wasn't a very good detective. He was just lucky. His luck\nhad enabled him to break a lot of tough cases. But some day people would\nfind out, and then--\n\n\"Well,\" the Queen said, \"at the very least you ought to _act_ like a\ndetective.\" She sniffed audibly. \"Sir Kenneth, I'm ashamed that a member\nof My Own FBI can't do any better than you're doing now.\"\n\nMalone blinked into the screen. He did feel ashamed in a vague sort of\nway, and he was willing to admit it. But he did feel, wistfully, that it\nwould be nice to know just what he was being ashamed of. \"Have I been\nmissing something?\" he said.\n\n\"Outside of the obvious,\" the Queen said, \"that you've been missing your\nnotebook--or, rather, Mike Fueyo's notebook.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" Malone said.\n\n\"You certainly have,\" the Queen said. \"Don't you see what happened to\nthat notebook? You've been missing the only possible explanation.\"\n\n\"All I can figure,\" Malone said, \"is that Dorothy Francis picked my\npocket.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" the Queen said. \"Now, if you'd only wear proper clothing, and\na proper pouch at your belt--\"\n\n\"I'd be stared at,\" Malone said. \"In court clothing--\"\n\n\"No one in New York would stare at you,\" the Queen said. \"They'd think\nit was what they call an advertising stunt.\"\n\n\"Anyhow,\" Malone said, \"I wasn't wearing court clothing. So that made it\neasy for her to steal the notebook.\"\n\nHer Majesty gave him a bright smile. \"There!\" she said.\n\n\"There, what?\" Malone said.\n\n\"I knew you could do it,\" the Queen said. \"All you had to do was apply\nyour intelligence and you'd come up with just the fact you needed.\"\n\n\"What fact?\" Malone said.\n\n\"That Miss Francis has your notebook,\" the Queen said. \"You just told\nme.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Malone said, and stopped, and took a deep breath. After a\npause he said: \"What is that supposed to mean? What on Earth would she\nwant with it? Just to look at all the pretty pictures?\"\n\n\"Don't be silly,\" the Queen said, with some asperity. \"She doesn't even\nwant to look at the thing. She doesn't care what's in it.\"\n\nMalone closed his eyes. \"Riddle time,\" he murmured. \"Great.\" Then he\nsighed. \"O.K.,\" he said. \"What _does_ she want with it? She must have\nsome use for it. She isn't just a kleptomaniac or something--is she?\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" the Queen said.\n\n\"Then she has a reason,\" Malone said. \"Fine. But what is it? Is she an\nauxiliary member of the Silent Spooks, or something like that? Don't\ntell me she's Mike Fueyo's girl friend. I don't think I could take that.\nIt's too silly.\"\n\n\"Naturally it's silly! Sir Kenneth, I--\" She stopped, and her face lit\nup suddenly with pleasure. \"Now you're on the right track!\" she said.\n\"You just keep right on with that line of thought.\"\n\nMalone blinked in awe. \"You mean she's--\"\n\nHe didn't want to say it. But the evidence was all there. Dorothy's\nappearance at the station. The remark Mrs. Fueyo had made when he went\nto the apartment.\n\nIt all fit.\n\n\"That's right,\" the Queen said, a little sadly. \"She's Dorothea\nFrancisca Fueyo--little Miguel Fueyo's older sister.\"\n\n\n\nXII.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nMalone put in a great deal of time, he imagined, just staring at the\nface of the little old lady in the screen. At last he said: \"Her name is\nFueyo!\"\n\n\"I've told you so,\" the Queen said with some asperity.\n\n\"I know,\" Malone said. \"But--\"\n\n\"You're excited,\" the Queen said. \"You're stunned. Goodness, you don't\nneed to tell me that, Sir Kenneth. I know.\"\n\n\"But she's--\" Malone discovered that he couldn't talk. He swallowed a\ncouple of times and then went on. \"She's Mike Fueyo's sister.\"\n\n\"That's exactly right, Sir Kenneth,\" the Queen said.\n\n\"Then she ... swiped the book to protect her little brother,\" Malone\nsaid. \"Oh, boy.\"\n\n\"Exactly, Sir Kenneth,\" the Queen said.\n\n\"And she doesn't care about me at all,\" Malone said. \"I mean, she only\nwent out with me because I was me. Malone. And she wanted the notebook.\nThat was all there was to it.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't say that, if I were you,\" she went on. \"Quite the contrary.\nShe does like you, you know. And she thinks you're a very nice person.\"\nThe Queen beamed. \"You are, you know,\" she said.\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said uncomfortably. \"Sure.\"\n\n\"You don't have to think that she merely went out with you because of\nher brother's notebook,\" the Queen said. \"But she does have a strong\nsense of loyalty--and he _is_ her younger brother, after all.\"\n\n\"He sure is,\" Malone said. \"He's a great kid, little Mike.\"\n\n\"You see,\" the Queen continued imperturbably, \"Mike told her about\nlosing the notebook the other night--when he struck you.\"\n\n\"When he struck me,\" Malone said. \"Oh, yes. He struck me all right.\"\n\n\"He guessed that you must have it when you started asking questions\nabout the Silent Spooks, you see,\" the Queen said. \"That was the only\nway you could have found out about him--unless you were telepathic.\nWhich, of course, you're not.\"\n\n\"No,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Now, understand me,\" the Queen said. \"I do not think that his striking\nyou was a very nice act.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"I don't either,\" Malone said. \"It hurt like ... it hurt quite a lot.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" the Queen said. \"But, then, he didn't hurt the car any, and\nhe didn't want to. He just wanted to ride around in it for a while.\"\n\n\"He likes red Cadillacs,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" the Queen said. \"He thinks they're wonderful.\"\n\n\"Good for him,\" Malone said sourly.\n\n\"Well, now,\" the Queen said. \"You just go right on over to her house. Of\ncourse, she doesn't live with an aunt.\"\n\n\"No,\" Malone said. \"She lives with Mike and his mother.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" the Queen said. \"She's part of the family.\"\n\nMalone nodded silently.\n\n\"She'll give you the book, Sir Kenneth. I just know that she will. And I\nwant you to be very nice to her when you ask for it. She's a very nice\ngirl, you know.\"\n\n\"She's a swell girl,\" Malone said morosely. \"And I'll ... hey. Wait a\nminute.\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir Kenneth?\"\n\n\"How come you can read her thoughts?\" Malone said. \"And Mike's? I\nthought you had to know somebody pretty well before you could read them\nat a distance like this. Do you? Know them, I mean.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" the Queen said. \"But I can read _you_, of course.\" Malone\ncould see that the Queen was trying very hard not to look proud of\nherself. \"And last night,\" she went on, \"you two were ... well, Sir\nKenneth, you had a real _rapport_ with each other. My goodness, yes.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"we--\"\n\n\"Don't explain, Sir Kenneth,\" the Queen said. \"It really isn't\nnecessary; I thought it was very sweet. And--in any case--I can pick her\nup now. Because of that rapport. Not quite as well as I can pick you up,\nbut enough to get the strong surface thoughts.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"But Mike--\"\n\n\"I can't pick him up at all, this far away,\" the Queen said. \"There is\njust a faint touch of him, though, through the girl. But all I know\nabout him is what she thinks.\" She smiled gently. \"He's a nice boy,\nbasically,\" she said.\n\n\"Sure he is,\" Malone said. \"He's got a nice blackjack, too--basically.\"\nHe grimaced. \"Were you reading my mind all last night?\" he said.\n\n\"Well,\" the Queen said, \"no. Toward morning you were getting so fuzzy I\njust didn't bother.\"\n\n\"I can understand that,\" Malone said. \"I nearly didn't bother myself.\"\n\nThe Queen nodded. \"But toward afternoon,\" she said, \"I didn't have\nanything to do, so I just listened in. You do have such a nice mind, Sir\nKenneth--so refreshing and different. Especially when you're in love.\"\n\nMalone blushed quietly.\n\n\"Oh, I know,\" the Queen said. \"You'd much rather think of yourself as a\nsort of apprentice lecher, a kind of cynical Don Juan, but--\"\n\n\"I know,\" Malone said. \"Don't tell me about it. All right?\"\n\n\"Of course, Sir Kenneth,\" the Queen said, \"if you wish it.\"\n\n\"Basically, I'm a nice boy,\" Malone said. \"Sure I am.\" He paused. \"Do\nyou have any more pertinent information, Your Majesty?\"\n\n\"Not right now,\" the Queen admitted. \"But if I do, I'll let you know.\"\nShe giggled. \"You know, I had to argue awfully hard with Dr. Hatterer to\nget to use the telephone,\" she said.\n\n\"I'll bet,\" Malone said.\n\n\"But I did manage,\" she said, and winked. \"I won't have that sort of\ntrouble again.\"\n\nMalone wondered briefly what dark secret Dr. Hatterer had, that Her\nMajesty had discovered in his mind and used to blackmail him with. At\nlast he decided that it was probably none of his business, and didn't\nmatter too much anyway.\n\n\"Quite right, Sir Kenneth,\" the Queen said. \"And good-bye for now.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Your Majesty,\" Malone said. He bowed again, and flipped off\nthe phone. Bowing in a phone booth wasn't the easiest thing in the world\nto do, he thought to himself. But somehow he had managed it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe reached into his pocket--half-convinced, for one second, that it was\nan Elizabethan belt-pouch. Talks with Her Majesty always had that\neffect; after a time, Malone came to believe in her strange, bright\nworld. But he shook off the lingering effects of her psychosis, fished\nout some coins and thought for a minute.\n\nSo Dorothy--Dorothea--had lifted the notebook. That was some help,\ncertainly. It let him know something more about the enemy he was facing.\nBut it wasn't really a lot of help.\n\nWhat did he do now?\n\nHer Majesty had suggested going to the Fueyo house, collaring the\ngirl--but treating her nicely, Malone reminded himself--and demanding\nthe book back. She'd even said he would get the book back--and, since\nshe knew some of what went on in Dorothea Fueyo's mind, she was probably\nright.\n\nBut what good was that going to do him?\n\nHe knew what was in the book. Getting it back was something that could\nwait. It didn't sound particularly profitable and it didn't even sound\nlike fun.\n\nWhat he needed was a next move. He thought for a minute, dropped the\ncoins into the phone and dialed the number of the police commissioner's\noffice. After a brief argument with a secretary, he had Fernack on the\nphone. And this time, Malone told himself, he was going to be polite.\n\nIf possible.\n\n\"Good afternoon, John Henry,\" he said sunnily, when the commissioner's\nface was finally on the screen. \"Can you get me some more information?\"\n\nFernack stared at him sourly. \"Depends,\" he said.\n\n\"On what?\" Malone said, telling himself he wasn't going to get\nirritated, and knowing perfectly well that he was lying.\n\n\"On what kind of information you want,\" Fernack said.\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"there's a warehouse I want to know some more\nabout. Who the owner is, for one thing, and--\"\n\nFernack nodded. \"I've got it,\" he said. He fished, apparently on his\ndesk, and brought up a sheet of paper. He held it up to the screen while\nMalone copied off the name and address. \"Lieutenant Lynch told me all\nabout it.\"\n\n\"Lynch?\" Malone said. \"But he--\"\n\n\"Lynch works for me, Malone,\" Fernack said. \"Remember that.\"\n\n\"But he said he'd--\"\n\n\"He said he wouldn't do anything, and he won't,\" Fernack said. \"He just\nreported it to me for my action. He knew I was working with you, Malone.\nAnd I _am_ his boss, remember.\"\n\n\"Great.\" Malone said. \"Now, John Henry--\"\n\n\"Hold it, Malone,\" Fernack said. \"I'd like a little information, too,\nyou know. I'd like to know just what is going on, if it isn't too much\ntrouble.\"\n\n\"It's not that. John Henry,\" Malone said earnestly. \"Really. It's just\nthat I--\"\n\n\"All this about vanishing boys,\" Fernack said. \"Disappearing into thin\nair. All this nonsense.\"\n\n\"It isn't nonsense,\" Malone said.\n\n\"All right,\" Fernack said indulgently. \"Boys disappear every day like\nthat. Sure they do.\" He leaned toward the screen and his voice was as\nhard as his face. \"Malone, are these kids mixed up with those impossible\nrobberies you had me looking up?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"I think so. But I doubt if you could prove it.\"\n\nFernack's face had begun its slow climb toward purple again. \"Malone,\"\nhe said, \"if you're suppressing evidence, even if you are the FBI,\nI'll--\"\n\n\"I'm not suppressing any evidence,\" Malone said. \"I don't think _you_\ncould prove a connection. I don't think _I_ could prove a connection. I\ndon't think _anybody_ could--not right now.\"\n\nFernack leaned back, apparently mollified.\n\n\"John Henry,\" Malone said, \"I want to ask you to keep your hands off\nthis case. To let me handle it my way.\"\n\nFernack nodded absently. \"Sure, Malone,\" he said.\n\n\"_What?_\"\n\n\"I said sure,\" Fernack said. \"Isn't that what you wanted?\"\n\n\"Well, yes,\" Malone said, \"but--\"\n\nFernack leaned all the way back in his chair, his face a mask of\ndisappointment and frustration. \"Malone,\" he said, \"I wish I'd never\nheard of this case. I wish I'd been retired or died before it ever came\nup. I've been a police officer in New York for a long time, and I wish\nthis case had waited a few more years to happen.\"\n\nHe stopped. Malone leaned against the back wall of the phone booth and\nlit a cigarette.\n\n\"Andy Burris called me less than half an hour ago,\" Fernack said.\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said.\n\n\"That's right,\" Fernack said. \"Good old Burris of the FBI. And he told\nme this was a National Security case. National Security. It's your baby,\nMalone, because Burris wants it that way.\" He snorted. \"So don't worry\nabout me,\" he said. \"I'm just here to co-operate. The patriotic, loyal,\ndumb slave of a grateful government.\"\n\nMalone blew out a plume of smoke. \"You know, John Henry,\" he said, \"you\nmight have made a good FBI man yourself. You've got the right attitude.\"\n\n\"Never mind the jokes,\" Fernack said bitterly.\n\n\"O.K.,\" Malone said. \"But tell me: Did you actually make arrangements\nfor me to get into that warehouse? I suppose you know that's what I\nwant.\"\n\n\"I guessed that much,\" Fernack said. \"I haven't made any arrangements at\nall yet, but I will. I'll have Safe and Loft get the keys, and a full\nset of floor plans to the place while they're at it. Will that do, Your\nMajesty?\"\n\nMalone choked on his smoke and shot a quick look over his shoulder.\nThere was nothing there but the wall of the booth. Queen Elizabeth I was\nnowhere in evidence. Then he realized that Fernack had been talking to\nhim.\n\n\"Don't do that,\" he said.\n\n\"What?\" Fernack said.\n\nMalone realized in one awful second how strange the explanation was\ngoing to sound. Could he say that he thought he'd been mistaken for an\nold friend of his, Elizabeth Tudor? Could he say that he'd just had a\ncall from her?\n\nIn the end he merely said: \"Nothing,\" and let it go at that.\n\n\"Well, anyhow,\" Fernack said, \"do you want anything else?\"\n\n\"Not right now,\" Malone said. \"I'll let you know, though. And--thanks,\nJohn Henry. No matter why you're doing this, thanks.\"\n\n\"I don't deserve 'em.\" Fernack muttered. \"And I hope you get caught in\nsome kind of deadfall and have to come screaming to the cops.\"\n\nThat, Malone reflected, was the second time a cop had suggested his\nyelling if he got into trouble.\n\nHadn't the police force ever heard of telephones?\n\nHe said good-by and flipped off.\n\nThen he stared at the screen for a little while, as his cigarette burned\ndown between his fingers. At last he put the cigarette out and went\ndownstairs again to the bar.\n\nIf he had to do some heavy thinking, he told himself, there was\nabsolutely no reason why he couldn't enjoy himself a little while doing\nit.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe evening rush had begun, and Malone found himself a stool by the\nsimple expedient of slipping into one while a drinker's back was turned.\nOnce ensconced, he huddled himself up like an old drunk, thus\neffectively cutting himself off from interruptions, and lit another\ncigarette. Ray was down at the other end of the bar, chatting with a\nred-headed woman and her pale, bald escort. Malone sighed and set\nhimself to the job of serious, constructive thinking.\n\nHow, he asked himself, do you go about catching a person who can vanish\naway like so much smoke?\n\nWell, Malone could think of one solution, but it was pretty bloody.\nNailing the kids to a wall would probably work, but he couldn't say much\nelse for it. There had to be another way out. For some reason Malone\njust couldn't see himself with a mouthful of nails, a hammer and a\nteen-ager.\n\nIt sounded just a little too messy.\n\nThen, of course, there were handcuffs.\n\nThat sounded a little better. The trouble was that Malone simply didn't\nhave enough information, and knew it. Obviously, the kids could carry\nstuff with them when they teleported; the stuff they stole proved that.\nAnd their clothes, Malone added. Apparently the kids didn't arrive at\nwherever they went stark staring naked.\n\nBut how close to a teleport did the things he carried have to be?\n\nIn other words. Malone thought, if you put handcuffs on a teleport,\nwould the handcuffs vanish when the teleport did? And did that include\nthe part of the cuff you were holding?\n\nWhat happened if you snapped half the cuff around your own wrist first?\nDid you go along with the teleport? Or did your wrist go, while you\nstayed behind and wondered how long it would take to bleed to death?\n\nOr what?\n\nAll the questions were intriguing ones. Malone sighed, wishing he knew\nthe answer to even one of them.\n\nIt was somewhat comforting to think that he'd managed to progress a\nlittle, anyway. The kids hadn't meant anybody to find out about\nthem--but Malone had found out about them, and alerted all the cops in\ntown, as well as the rest of the FBI. He knew just who they were, and\nwhere they lived, and how they performed the \"miracles\" they performed.\n\nAnyhow, he knew something about that last item.\n\nHe even knew who had his notebook.\n\nHe tabled that thought, and went back to feeling victorious. Within a\nfew seconds, the sense of achievement was gone, and futility had come in\nits place. After all, he still didn't know how to catch the kids, did\nhe?\n\nNo.\n\nHe thought about handcuffs some more and then gave up. He'd just have to\ntry it and see how it worked. And if the teleports took his wrist away\nhe'd ... he'd ... he'd go after them and make them give it back.\n\nSure he would.\n\nThat reminded him of the notebook again, and, since the thing was being\nso persistent, he decided he might as well pay some attention to it.\n\nDorothea had the notebook. Malone tried to see himself barging in on her\nand asking for it, and he didn't care for the picture at all--no matter\nhow Good Queen Bess felt about it.\n\nAfter all, she thought Mike Fueyo was basically a nice kid.\n\nSo what did she know?\n\nHe closed his eyes. There he was, in the Fueyo apartment, talking to\nDorothea.\n\n\"Dorothea,\" he muttered. \"You filched my notebook.\"\n\nThat didn't sound very effective. And besides, it wasn't really his\nnotebook. He tried again.\n\n\"Dorothea, you pinched your brother's notebook.\"\n\nNow, for some reason, it sounded like something covered by the Vice\nSquad. It sounded terrible. But there were other ways of saying the same\nthing.\n\n\"Dorothea,\" he muttered, \"you borrowed your brother's notebook.\"\n\nThat was too patronizing. Malone told himself that he sounded like a\ncharacter straight out of the 3-D screens, and settled himself gamely\nfor another try.\n\n\"Dorothea, you _have_ your brother's notebook.\"\n\nTo which the obvious answer was: \"Yes, I do, and so what?\"\n\nOr, possibly: \"How do you know?\"\n\nAnd Malone thought about answering that one. \"Queen Elizabeth told me,\"\nwas the literal truth, but somehow it didn't sound like it. And he\ncouldn't find another answer to give the girl.\n\n\"Dorothea,\" he said, and a voice from nowhere added:\n\n\"Will you have another drink?\"\n\nMalone exploded, \"That's not the question. Drinks have nothing to do\nwith notebooks. I'm after notebooks. Can't you understand--\" Belatedly,\nhe looked up.\n\nThere was Ray, the barman.\n\n\"Oh,\" he said.\n\n\"I just came over,\" Ray said. \"And I figured if you couldn't find your\nnotebook, maybe you'd like a drink. So long as you're here.\"\n\n\"Ray,\" Malone said with feeling, \"you are an eminently reasonable\nfellow. I accept your solution. Nay, more. I endorse your solution.\nWholeheartedly.\"\n\nRay went off to mix, and Malone stared after him happily. This was\nreally a nice place, he reflected--almost as nice as the City Hall Bar\nin Chicago where he'd gone long ago with his father.\n\nBut he tore his mind away from the happy past and concentrated, instead,\non the miserable present. He decided for the last time that he was not\ngoing to ask Dorothea for the book--not just yet, anyhow. After all, it\nwasn't as if he needed the book; he knew his own name, and he knew\nLynch's name, and he knew the names on the second page. And he didn't\nsee any particular need for a picture of a red Cadillac, no matter how\nnicely colored it was.\n\nSo, he asked himself, why embarrass everybody by trying to get it back?\n\nOf course, it _was_ technically a crime to pick pockets, and that went\ndouble or triple for the pockets of FBI agents. But Malone told himself\nthat he didn't feel like pressing charges, anyhow. And Dorothy probably\ndidn't make a habit of pocket-picking.\n\nHe sighed and glanced at his watch. It was fifteen minutes of six.\n\nNow, he knew what his next move was going to be.\n\nHe was going to go back to his hotel and change his clothes.\n\nThat is, he amended, as soon as he finished the drink that Ray was\nsetting up in front of him.\n\n\n\n\nXIII.\n\n\nBy the time Malone reached the Statler Hilton Hotel it was six-twenty.\nMalone hadn't reckoned with New York's rush-hour traffic, and, after\nseeing it, he still didn't believe it. Finding a cab had been\nimpossible, and he had started for the subway, hoping that he wouldn't\nget lost and end up somewhere in Brooklyn.\n\nBut one look at the shrieking mob trying to sardine itself into the\nSeventh Avenue subway entrance had convinced him it was better to walk.\nBucking the street crowds was bad enough. Bucking the subway crowds was\nsomething Malone didn't even want to think about.\n\nHe let himself into his room, and was taking off his shoes with a\ngrateful sigh when there was a rap on the door of the bathroom that\nconnected his room with Boyd's. Malone padded over to the door, his\nshoes in one hand. \"Tom?\" he said.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"You were expecting maybe Titus Moody?\" Boyd called.\n\n\"O.K.,\" Malone said. \"Come on in.\"\n\nBoyd pushed open the door. He was stripped to the waist, a state of\ndress which showed the largest expanse of chest Malone had ever seen,\nand he was carrying the small scissors which he used to trim his Henry\nVIII beard. He stabbed the scissors toward Malone, who shuffled back\nhurriedly.\n\n\"Listen,\" Boyd said, \"did you call the office after you left this\nafternoon?\"\n\n\"No,\" Malone admitted. \"Why? What happened?\"\n\n\"There was a call for you,\" Boyd said. \"Long Distance, just before I\nleft at five. I came on back to the hotel and waited until I heard you\ncome in. Thought you might want to know about it.\"\n\n\"I do, I guess,\" Malone said. \"Who from?\" Looking at Boyd, a modern-day\nHenry VIII, the association was too obvious to be missed. Malone thought\nof Good Queen Bess, and wondered why she was calling him again.\n\nAnd--more surprising--why she'd called him at FBI headquarters, when she\nmust have known that he wasn't there.\n\n\"Dr. O'Connor,\" Boyd said.\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said, somewhat relieved. \"At Yucca Flats.\"\n\nBoyd nodded. \"Right,\" he said. \"You're to call Operator Nine.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\" Malone went over to the phone, remembered his shoes and put\nthem down carefully on the floor. \"Anything else of importance?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"On the Cadillacs,\" Boyd said. \"We've got a final report now. Leibowitz\nand Hardin finally finished checking the last of them--there weren't\nquite as many as we were afraid there were going to be. Red isn't a very\npopular color around here.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Malone said.\n\n\"And there isn't a doggone thing on any of 'em,\" Boyd said. \"Oh, we\ncleared up a lot of small-time crime, one thing and another, but that's\nabout all. No such thing as an electro-psionic brain to be found\nanywhere in the lot. Leibowitz says he's willing to swear to it.\"\n\nMalone sighed. \"I didn't think he'd find one,\" he said.\n\n\"You didn't?\"\n\n\"No,\" Malone said.\n\nBoyd stabbed at him with the scissors again. \"Then why did you cause all\nthat trouble?\" he said.\n\n\"Because I thought we might find electro-psionic brains,\" Malone said\nwearily. \"Or one, anyhow.\"\n\n\"But you just said--\"\n\nMalone picked up the phone, got Long Distance and motioned Boyd to\nsilence in one sweeping series of moves. The Long Distance Operator\nsaid: \"Yes, sir? May we help you?\"\n\n\"Give me Operator Nine,\" Malone said.\n\nThere was a buzz, a click and a new voice which said: \"Operator Ni-yun.\nMay we help you?\"\n\n\"All nine of you?\" Malone muttered. \"Never mind. This is Kenneth Malone.\nI've got a call from Dr. Thomas O'Connor at Yucca Flats. Please connect\nme.\"\n\nThere was another buzz, a click and an ungodly howl which was followed\nby the voice of Operator Ni-yun saying: \"We are connecting you. There\nwill be a slight delay. We are sor-ree.\"\n\nMalone waited. At last there was another small howl, and the screen lit\nup. Dr. O'Connor's face, as stern and ascetic as ever, stared through at\nMalone.\n\n\"I understand you called me,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" Dr. O'Connor said. \"It's very good to see you again, Mr.\nMalone.\" He gave Malone a smile good for exchange at your corner\ngrocery: worth, one icicle.\n\n\"It's good to see you, too,\" Malone lied.\n\n\"Mr. Burris explained to me what it was that you wanted to talk to me\nabout,\" O'Connor said. \"Am I to understand that you have actually found\na teleport?\"\n\n\"Unless my theories are away off,\" Malone said, \"I've done a lot better\nthan that. I've found eight of them.\"\n\n\"Eight!\" Dr. O'Connor's smile grew perceptibly warmed. It now stood at\nabout thirty-four degrees Fahrenheit. \"That is really excellent, Mr.\nMalone. You have done a fine job.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Malone muttered. He wished that O'Connor didn't make him feel\nquite so much like a first-year law student talking to an egomaniacal\nprofessor.\n\n\"When can you deliver them?\" O'Connor said.\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said carefully, \"that depends.\" O'Connor seemed to view\nthe teleports as pieces of equipment, he thought. \"I can't deliver them\nuntil I catch them,\" he said. \"And that's why I wanted to talk to you.\"\n\n\"Some slight delay,\" Dr. O'Connor said, \"will be quite understandable.\"\nHis face left no doubt that he didn't like the necessity of\nunderstanding anything that was going to keep him and the eight\nteleports apart for even thirty seconds longer, now that he knew about\nthem.\n\n\"You see,\" Malone said, \"they're kids. Juvenile delinquents, or\nsomething like that. But they are teleports, that's for sure.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Dr. O'Connor said.\n\n\"So we've got to nab them,\" Malone said. \"And for that I need all the\ninformation I can get.\"\n\nDr. O'Connor nodded slowly. \"I'll be happy,\" he said, \"to give you any\ninformation I can provide.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMalone took a deep breath, and plunged. \"How does this teleportation bit\nwork, anyhow?\" he said.\n\n\"You've asked a very delicate question,\" Dr. O'Connor said. \"Actually,\nwe can't be quite positive.\" His expression showed just how little he\nwanted to make this admission. \"However,\" he went on, brightening,\n\"there is some evidence which seems to show that it is basically the\nsame process as psychokinesis. And we do have quite a bit of empirical\ndata on psychokinesis.\" He scribbled something on a sheet of paper and\nsaid: \"For instance, there's this.\" He held the paper up to the screen\nso that Malone could read it.\n\nIt said:\n\n  md\n  ----- = K\n  ft2\n\nMalone looked at it for some seconds. At last he said: \"It's very\npretty. What is it?\"\n\n\"This,\" Dr. O'Connor said, in the tone of voice that meant You Should\nHave Known All Along, But You're Just Hopeless, \"is the basic formula\nfor the phenomenon, where _m_ is the mass in grams, _d_ is the distance\nin centimeters, _f_ is the force in dynes and _t_ is the time in\nseconds. _K_ is a constant whose value is not yet known.\"\n\nMalone said: \"Hm-m-m,\" and stared at the equation again. Somehow, the\nexplanation was not very helpful. The value of _K_ was unknown. He\nunderstood that much, all right but it didn't seem to do him any good.\n\n\"As you can see,\" Dr. O'Connor went on, \"the greater the force, and the\nlonger time it is applied, the greater distance any mass can be moved.\nOr, contrariwise, the more mass, the greater mass, that is, the easier\nit is to move it any given distance. This is, as you undoubtedly\nunderstand, not at all in contradistinction to physical phenomena.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Malone said, feeling that something was expected of him, but not\nbeing quite sure what.\n\nDr. O'Connor frowned. \"I must admit,\" he said, \"that the uncertainty as\nto the constant _k_, and the lack of any real knowledge as to just what\nkind of force is being applied, have held up our work so far.\" Then his\nface smoothed out. \"Of course, when we have the teleports to work with,\nwe may derive a full set of laws which--\"\n\n\"Never mind that now,\" Malone said.\n\n\"But our work is most important, Mr. Malone,\" Dr. O'Connor said with a\nmotion of his eyebrows. \"As I'm sure you must understand.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said, feeling as if he'd been caught without his homework,\n\"of course. But if you don't mind--\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Malone?\" Dr. O'Connor said smoothly.\n\n\"What I want to know,\" Malone said, \"is this: what are the limitations\nof this ... uh ... phenomenon?\"\n\nDr. O'Connor brightened visibly. \"The limitations are several,\" he said.\n\"In the first place, there is the force represented by _f_ in the\nequation. This seems to be entirely dependent on the ... ah ... strength\nof the subject's personality. That is if we assume that the process is\nat all parallel with the phenomena of psychokinesis and levitation. And\nthere are excellent theoretical reasons for so believing.\"\n\n\"In other words,\" Malone said, \"a man with a strong will would be able\nto exert more force than a weaker-willed man?\"\n\n\"Correct,\" Dr. O'Connor said. \"And another factor is the time, _t_. What\nwe are measuring here is the span of attention of the individual--the\nability of the subject's mind to concentrate on a given thing for a span\nof time. Many people, for example, cannot keep their attention focused\non a single thought for more than a few milliseconds, it seems. They are\n... ah ... 'scatter-brained,' as the saying is.\"\n\nHis expression left no doubt that he included Malone in that group.\nMalone tried not to look nervous.\n\nThen Dr. O'Connor scowled. \"There is another factor which we feel should\nbe in the equation,\" he said, \"but we have not yet found a precise way\nto express it mathematically. You must realize that the mathematical\ntreatment of psionics is, as yet, in a relatively primitive stage.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"Of course. Sure. But this other factor--\"\n\n\"It is what might be called the ... ah ... _volume_ of attention,\" Dr.\nO'Connor said. \"That is, the actual amount of space that can be\nconceived of and held by the subject, during the time he is\nconcentrating.\"\n\nMalone blinked.\n\n\"For most people,\" Dr. O'Connor said, \"the awareness of the space\nsurrounding them is limited to a few inches of moving space, no more. To\nput this in a purely physical matrix: one might say that the\n'teleportation field' doesn't extend more than a few inches beyond the\nskin of the subject. Thus, it would be difficult to teleport anything\nreally large unless one were able to increase the volume of attention,\nor awareness. However, it is difficult to express this notion\nmathematically.\"\n\n\"I'll bet,\" Malone said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. O'Connor shot him a frozen glance. \"One of our early attempts,\" he\nsaid, \"was simply to put this in as a volume factor, so that the\nleft-hand side of the equation, below the line, would read--\" He\nscribbled again on the paper and held it up:\n\n  m d\n  ---- = K\n  d3ft2\n\n\"Unfortunately, as you can perhaps see,\" Dr. O'Connor said, \"the\nequation would not stand up under dimensional analysis.\"\n\n\"Oh, sure,\" Malone said, adding sympathetically: \"That's too bad. But\ndoes that put a limit on how much a man could carry with him? I mean, he\ncouldn't take a whole building along, or anything like that, could he?\"\n\n\"I doubt it,\" Dr. O'Connor said gravely. \"That would require a\ntremendous volume of space for one to focus his entire attention on, as\na whole, for any useful length of time. It would require a type of mind\nthat I am not even sure exists.\"\n\n\"In the case of a young, inexperienced boy,\" Malone said stubbornly,\n\"would you say that he could carry off anything heavy?\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" Dr. O'Connor said. \"Nor, as a matter of fact, could he\ncarry off anything that was securely bolted down; I hope you follow me?\"\n\n\"I think so,\" Malone said. \"But look here: suppose you handcuffed him\nto, say, a radiator or a jail cell bar.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Could he get away?\"\n\nDr. O'Connor appeared to consider this with some care. \"Well,\" he said\nat last, \"he certainly couldn't take the radiator with him, or the cell\nbar. If that's what you mean.\" He hesitated, looked slightly shamefaced,\nand then went on: \"But you must realize that we lack any really\nextensive data on this phenomenon.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Malone said.\n\n\"That's why I'm so very anxious to get those subjects,\" Dr. O'Connor\nsaid.\n\n\"Dr. O'Connor,\" Malone said earnestly, \"that's just what I had in mind\nfrom the start. I've been going to a lot of extra trouble to make sure\nthat those kids don't get killed or end up in reform schools or\nsomething, just so you could work with them.\"\n\n\"I appreciate that, Mr. Malone,\" O'Connor said gravely.\n\nMalone felt as if someone had given him a gold star. Fighting down the\nemotion, he went on: \"I know right now that I can catch one or two of\nthem. But I don't know for sure that I can hold one for more than a\nfraction of a second.\"\n\n\"I see your problem,\" Dr. O'Connor said. \"Believe me, Mr. Malone. I do\nsee your problem.\"\n\n\"And is there a way out?\" Malone said. \"I mean a way I can hold on to\nthem for--\"\n\n\"At present,\" Dr. O'Connor said heavily, \"I have no suggestions. I lack\ndata.\"\n\n\"Oh, fine,\" Malone said. \"We need the kids to get the data, and we need\nthe data to get the kids.\" He sighed. \"Hooray for our side,\" he added.\n\n\"There does appear to be something of a dilemma here,\" Dr. O'Connor\nadmitted sadly.\n\n\"Dilemma is putting it mildly,\" Malone said.\n\nDr. O'Connor opened his mouth, shut it, opened it again and said: \"I\nagree.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"maybe one of us will think of something. If\nanything does occur to you, let me know at once.\"\n\n\"I certainly will,\" Dr. O'Connor said. \"Believe me, Mr. Malone, I want\nyou to capture those--kids--just as badly as you want to capture them\nyourself.\"\n\n\"I'll try,\" Malone said at random. He flipped off and turned with a\nsense of relief back to Boyd. But it looked as if Henry VIII had been\nhit on the head with a cow, or something equally weighty. Boyd looked\nglassy-eyed and slightly stunned.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What's the matter with you?\" Malone said. \"Sick?\"\n\n\"I'm not sick,\" Boyd said carefully. \"At least I don't think I'm sick.\nIt's hard to tell.\"\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"Teleporting?\" Boyd said. \"Juvenile delinquents?\"\n\nMalone felt a sudden twinge in the area of his conscience. He realized\nthat he had told Boyd nothing at all about what had been going on since\nthe discovery of the notebook two nights ago. He filled his partner in\nrapidly while Boyd stood in front of the mirror and rather shakily\nattempted to trim his beard.\n\n\"That's why I had the car search continue,\" Malone said. \"I was fairly\nsure the fault wasn't in the cars, but the boys. But I had to make\nabsolutely sure.\"\n\nBoyd said: \"Oh,\" chopped a small section out of the center of his beard\nand added: \"My hand's shaky.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"that's the story.\"\n\n\"It sure is quite a story,\" Boyd said. \"And I don't want you to think I\ndon't believe it. Because I don't.\"\n\n\"It's true,\" Malone said.\n\n\"That doesn't affect me,\" Boyd said. \"I'll go along with the gag. But\nenough is enough. Vanishing teen-agers. Ridiculous.\"\n\n\"Just so you go along with me,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Oh, I'll go along,\" Boyd said. \"This is my vacation, too, isn't it?\nWhat's the next move, Mastermind?\"\n\n\"We're going down to that warehouse,\" Malone said decisively. \"I've got\na hunch the kids have been hiding there ever since they left their homes\nyesterday.\"\n\n\"Malone,\" Boyd said.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You mean we're going down to the warehouse _tonight_?\" Boyd said.\n\nMalone nodded.\n\n\"I might have known,\" Boyd said. \"I might have known.\"\n\n\"Tom,\" Malone said. \"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing,\" Boyd said. \"Nothing at all. Everything's fine and dandy.\nI think I'm going to commit suicide, but don't let that bother you.\"\n\n\"What happened?\" Malone said.\n\nBoyd stared at him. \"You happened,\" he said. \"You and the teen-agers and\nthe warehouse happened. Three days' work--ruined.\"\n\nMalone scratched his head, found out that his head still hurt and put\nhis hand down again. \"What work?\" he said.\n\n\"For three days,\" Boyd said, \"I've been taking this blond chick all over\nNew York. Wining her. Dining her. Spending money as if I were Burris\nhimself, instead of the common or garden variety of FBI agent. Night\nclubs. Theaters. Bars. The works. Malone, we were getting along\nfamously. It was wonderful.\"\n\n\"And tonight--\" Malone said.\n\n\"Tonight,\" Boyd said, \"was supposed to be the night. The big night. The\npayoff. We've got a date for dinner--T-bone steak, two inches thick,\nwith mushrooms. At her apartment, Malone.\"\n\n\"You'll have to break it,\" Malone said sympathetically. \"Too bad, but it\ncan't be helped now. You can pick up a sandwich before you go.\"\n\n\"A sandwich,\" Boyd said with great dignity, \"is not my idea of something\nto eat.\"\n\n\"Look, Tom--\" Malone began.\n\n\"All right, all right,\" Boyd said tiredly. \"Duty is duty. I'll go call\nher.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Malone said. \"And meanwhile, I'll get us a little insurance.\"\n\n\"Insurance?\"\n\n\"John Henry Fernack,\" Malone Malone said, \"and his Safe and Loft Squad.\"\n\n\n\n\nXIV.\n\n\nThe warehouse was locked up tight, all right, Malone thought. In the dim\nlight that surrounded the neighborhood, it stood like a single stone\nblock, alone near the waterfront. There were other buildings nearby, but\nthey seemed smaller; the warehouse loomed over Malone and Boyd\nthreateningly. They stood in a shadow-blacked alley just across the\nstreet, watching the big building nervously, studying it for weak points\nand escape areas.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nBoyd whispered softly: \"Do you think they have a lookout?\"\n\nMalone's voice was equally low. \"We'll have to assume they've got at\nleast one kid posted,\" he said. \"But they can't be watching all the\ntime. Remember, they can't do everything.\"\n\n\"They don't have to,\" Boyd said. \"They do quite enough for me. Do you\nrealize that, right now, I could be--\"\n\n\"Break it up,\" Malone said. He took a small handset from his pocket and\npressed the stud. \"Lynch?\" he whispered.\n\nA tinny voice came from the earpiece. \"Here, Malone.\"\n\n\"Have you got them located yet?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Not yet,\" Lynch's voice replied. \"We're working on a triangulation now.\nJust hold on for a minute or so. I'll let you know as soon as we've got\nresults.\"\n\nThe police squads--Lynch and his men, the warehouse precinct men and the\nSafe and Loft Squad--had set up a careful cordon around the area, and\nwere now hard at work trying to determine two things.\n\nFirst, they had to know whether there was anybody in the building at\nall.\n\nSecond, they had to be able to locate anyone in the building with\nprecision.\n\nThe silence of the downtown warehouse district helped. They had several\nspecially designed, highly sensitive directional microphones aimed at\nthe building from carefully selected spots around the area, trying to\npick up the muffled sounds of speech or motion within the warehouse. The\nwatchmen in buildings nearby had been warned off for the time being so\nthat their footsteps wouldn't occlude any results.\n\nMalone waited, feeling nervous and cold. Finally Lynch's voice came\nthrough again. \"We're getting something, all right,\" he said. \"There are\nobviously several people in there. You were right, Malone.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Thanks,\" Malone said. \"How about that fix?\"\n\n\"Hold it a second,\" Lynch said. Wind swept off the river at Malone and\nBoyd. Malone closed his eyes and shivered. He could smell fish and\niodine and waste, the odor of the Hudson as it passes the city. Across\nthe river lights sparkled warmly. Here there was nothing but darkness.\n\nA long time passed, perhaps ten seconds.\n\nThen Lynch's voice was back: \"Sergeant McNulty says they're on the top\nfloor, Malone,\" he said. \"Can't tell how many for sure. But they're\ntalking and moving around.\"\n\n\"It's a shame these things won't pick up the actual words at a\ndistance,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Just a general feeling of noise is all we get,\" Lynch said. \"But it\ndoes some good.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"Now listen carefully: Boyd and I are going in.\nAlone.\"\n\nLynch's voice whispered: \"Right.\"\n\n\"If those mikes pick up any unusual ruckus--any sharp increase in the\nnoise level--come running,\" Malone said. \"Otherwise, just sit still and\nwait for my signal. Got that?\"\n\n\"Check,\" Lynch said.\n\nMalone pocketed the radiophone. \"O.K., Tom,\" he whispered. \"This is\nH-hour--M-minute--and S-second.\"\n\n\"I can spell,\" Boyd muttered. \"Let's move in.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Malone said. He took his goggles and brought them down\nover his eyes, adjusting the helmet on his head. Boyd did the same.\nMalone flicked on the infrared flashlight he held in his hand.\n\n\"O.K.?\" he whispered.\n\n\"Check,\" Boyd said.\n\nThanks to the goggles, both of them could see the normally invisible\nbeams of the infrared flashlight. They'd equipped themselves to move in\ndarkness without betraying themselves, and they'd be able to see where a\nperson without equipment would be blind.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMalone stayed well within the shadows as he moved silently around to the\nalley behind the warehouse and then to a narrow passageway that led to\nthe building next door. Boyd followed a few feet behind him along the\ncarefully planned route.\n\nMalone unlocked the small door that led into the ground floor of the\nbuilding adjoining. As he did so he heard a sound behind him and called:\n\"Tom?\"\n\n\"Hey, Malone,\" Boyd whispered. \"It's--\"\n\nBefore there was any outcry, Malone rushed back. Boyd was struggling\nwith a figure in the dimness. Malone grabbed the figure and clamped his\nhand over its mouth. It bit him. He swore in a low voice, and clamped\nthe hand over the mouth again.\n\nIt hadn't taken him more than half a second to realize what, whoever it\nwas who struggled in his arms, it wasn't a boy.\n\n\"Shut up!\" Malone hissed in her ear. \"I won't hurt you.\"\n\nThe struggle stopped immediately. Malone gently eased his hand off the\ngirl's mouth. She turned and looked at him.\n\n\"Kenneth Malone,\" she said, \"you look like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\"Dorothea!\" Malone gasped. \"What are you doing here? Looking for your\nbrother?\"\n\n\"Never mind that,\" she said. \"You play too rough. I'm going home to\nmother.\"\n\n\"Answer me!\" Malone said.\n\n\"All right,\" Dorothea said. \"You must know anyhow, since you're here.\nYes, I'm looking for that fat-headed brother of mine. But now I suppose\nit's too late. He'll ... he'll go to prison.\"\n\nHer voice broke. Malone found his shoulder suddenly occupied by a crying\nface.\n\n\"No,\" he said quickly. \"No. Please. He won't.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\nBoyd whispered: \"Malone, what is this? It's no place for a date. And\nI--\"\n\n\"Oh, shut up,\" Malone told him in a kindly fashion. He turned back to\nDorothea. \"I promise he won't,\" he said. \"If I can just talk to your\nbrother, make him listen to reason, I think we can get him and the\nothers off. Believe me.\"\n\n\"But you--\"\n\n\"Please,\" Malone said. \"Believe me.\"\n\n\"Oh, Ken,\" Dorothea said, raising her head. \"Do you ... do you mean it?\"\n\n\"Sure I mean it,\" Malone said. \"What have I been saying? The Government\nneeds these kids.\"\n\n\"The Government?\"\n\n\"It's nothing to worry about,\" Malone said. \"Just go on home now, all\nright? I'll call you tomorrow. Late tonight, if I can. All right?\"\n\n\"No,\" Dorothea said. \"It's not all right. Not at all.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\nBoyd hissed: \"Malone!\"\n\nMalone ignored him. He had a bigger fight on his hands. \"I'm not going\nhome,\" Dorothea announced. \"I'm going in there with you. After all,\" she\nadded, \"I can talk more sense into Mike's head than you can.\"\n\n\"Now, look,\" Malone began.\n\nDorothea grinned in the darkness. \"If you don't take me along,\" she said\nquietly, \"I'll scream and warn them.\"\n\nMalone surrendered at once. He had no doubt at all that Dorothea meant\nwhat she said. And, after all, the girl might really be some use to\nthem. And there probably wouldn't be much danger.\n\nOf course there wouldn't, he thought. He was going to see to that.\n\n\"All right,\" he said. \"Come along. Stick close to us, and don't worry\nabout the darkness. We can see, even if you can't, so let us guide you.\nBut be quiet!\"\n\nBoyd whispered: \"Malone, what's going on?\"\n\n\"She's coming with us,\" Malone said, pointing to Dorothea.\n\nBoyd shrugged. \"Malone,\" he said, \"who do you think you are? The Pied\nPiper of Hamelin?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMalone wheeled and went ahead. Opening the door, he played his I-R\nflashlight on the room inside and he, Boyd and Dorothea trailed in,\ngoing through rooms piled with huge boxes. They went up an iron stairway\nto the second floor, and so on up to the roof.\n\nThey moved across the roof quickly under the cold stars, to the wall of\nthe warehouse, which was two stories higher than the building they were\non. Of course, there were no windows in the warehouse wall facing them,\nexcept on the top story.\n\nBut there was a single, heavy, fireproof emergency exit. It would have\ntaken power machinery or explosives to open that door from the outside\nwithout a key, although from the inside it would open easily.\n\nFortunately, Malone had a key.\n\nHe took it out and stepped aside. \"Give that lock the works,\" he\nwhispered to Boyd.\n\nBoyd took a lubricant gun from his pocket and fired three silent shots\nof special oil into the lock. Then he shot the hinges, and cracks around\nthe door.\n\nThey waited for a minute or two while the oil, forced in under pressure,\ndid its work. Then Malone fitted the key carefully into the lock and\nturned it, slowly and delicately. The door swung open in silence. Malone\nslipped inside, followed by Boyd and Dorothea Fueyo.\n\nInfrared equipment went on again, and the eerie illumination spread over\ntheir surroundings. Malone tapped Boyd on the shoulder and jerked his\nthumb toward the back stairs. This was plainly no time for talk.\n\nFrom the floor above, they could hear the murmur of youthful voices.\n\nThey started for the stairway. Fortunately, the building was of the\nsteel-and-concrete type; there were no wooden floors to creak and groan\nbeneath their feet.\n\nAt the bottom of the stairs, they paused. Voices came down the stairwell\nclearly, even words being defined in the silence.\n\n\"... And quit harping on whose fault it was.\" Malone recognized Mike\nFueyo's voice. \"That FBI guy was on to us and we had to pull out; you\nknow that. We always figured we'd have to pull out some day. So why not\nnow?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" another voice said. \"But you didn't have to go and vanish right\nunder that Fed's nose. You been beating into our heads not to do that\nsort of stuff ever since we first found out we could make this vanishing\nbit. And then you go and do it in front of a Fed. Smart. Sure, you get a\nbig bang out of it, but is it smart? I ask you--\"\n\n\"Yeah?\" Mike said. \"Listen, Silvo, they never would've got onto us if it\nhadn't been for your stupid tricks. Slugging a cop on the dome. Cracking\nup a car. You and your bug for speed!\"\n\nMalone blinked. Then it hadn't been Miguel Fueyo who'd hit Sergeant\nJukovsky, but Silvo. Malone tried to remember the list of Silent Spooks.\nSilvo ... Envoz. That was it.\n\n\"You slugged the FBI guy, Mike,\" Silvo said. \"And now you got us all on\nthe run. That's your fault, Mike. I want to see my old lady.\"\n\n\"I had to slug him,\" Mike said. \"Listen, all Ramon's stuff was in that\nCadillac. What'd have happened if he'd found all that stuff?\"\n\n\"So what happened anyway?\" another voice--Ramon?--said. \"He found your\nstupid notebook, didn't he? He went yelling to the cops, didn't he?\nWe're running, ain't we? So what difference?\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" Mike roared.\n\n\"You ain't telling me to shut up!\" (That was the third voice. Malone\nthought; possibly Ramon Otravez.)\n\n\"Me either!\" Silvo yelled. \"You think you're a great big-shot, you think\nyou're king of the world!\"\n\n\"Who figured out the Vanish?\" Mike screamed. \"You'd all be a bunch of\nbums if I hadn't showed you that! And you know it! You'd all--\"\n\n\"Don't give us that!\" Silvo said. \"We'd have been able to do it, same as\nyou. Like you said, anybody who's got talent could do it. There were\nguys you tried to teach--\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said a fourth voice. \"Listen, Fueyo, you're so bright--so why\ndon't you try teaching it to somebody who don't have the talent?\"\n\n\"Yeah!\" said voice number five. \"You think you could teach that flashy\nsister of yours the Vanish?\"\n\n\"You shut up about my sister, Phil!\" Mike screamed.\n\n\"So what's so great about her?\"\n\n\"She got that book back from the Fed,\" Mike said. \"That's what. It's\nenough!\"\n\nA voice said, \"Any dame with a little--\"\n\n\"Shut your face before I shut it for you!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMalone couldn't tell who was yelling what at who after a minute. They\nall seemed unhappy about being on the run from the police, and they were\nall tired of being cooped up in a warehouse under Mike's orders. Mike\nwas the only person they could take it out on--and Mike was under heavy\nattack.\n\nTwo of the boys, surprisingly, seemed to side with him. The other five\nwere trying to outshout them. Malone wondered if it would become a\nfight, and then realized that these kids could hardly fight each other\nwhen the one who was losing could always fade out.\n\nHe leaned over and whispered to Dorothea and Boyd: \"Let's sneak up there\nwhile the argument's going on.\"\n\n\"But--\" Boyd began.\n\n\"Less chance of their noticing us,\" Malone explained, and started\nforward.\n\nThey tiptoed up the stairs and got behind a pile of crates in the\nshadows, while invectives roared around them. This floor was lit by a\nsingle small bulb hanging from a socket in the ceiling. The windows were\nhung with heavy blankets to keep the light from shining out.\n\nThe kids didn't notice anything except each other. Malone took a couple\nof deep breaths and began to look around.\n\nAll things considered, he thought, the kids had fixed the place up\npretty nicely. The unused warehouse had practically been made over into\nan apartment. There were chairs, beds, tables and everything else in the\nline of furnishings for which the kids could conceivably have any use.\nThere were even some floor lamps scattered around, but they weren't\nplugged in. Malone guessed that a job would have to be done on the\nwarehouse wiring to get the floor lamps in operation, and the kids just\nhadn't got around to it yet.\n\nBy now, the boys were practically standing toe to toe, ripping\nair-bluing epithets out at each other. Not a single hand was lifted.\n\nMalone stared at them for a second, then turned to Dorothea. \"We'll wait\ntill they calm down a little,\" he whispered. \"Then you go out and talk\nto them. Tell them we won't hurt them or lock them up or anything. All\nwe want to do is talk to them for a while.\"\n\n\"All right,\" she whispered back.\n\n\"They can vanish any time they want to,\" Malone said, \"so there's no\nreason for them not to listen to--\"\n\nHe stopped suddenly, listening. Over the shouting, screaming and cursing\nof the kids, he heard motion on the floor below.\n\nCops?\n\nIt couldn't be, he told himself. But when he took out his radiophone,\nhis hands were shaking a little.\n\nLynch's voice was already coming over it when Malone thumbed it on.\n\n\"... So hang on, Malone! I repeat: we heard the ruckus, and we're coming\nin! We're on our way! Hang on, Malone!\"\n\nThe voice stopped. There was a click.\n\nMalone stared at the handset, fascinated and horrified. He swallowed.\n\"No, Lynch!\" he whispered, afraid to talk any louder for fear the kids\nwould hear him. \"No! Don't come up! Go away! Repeat: go away! Stay away!\nLynch--\"\n\nIt was no use. The radiophone was dead.\n\nLynch, apparently thinking Malone's set had been smashed in the fight,\nor else that Malone was unconscious, had shut his own receiver off.\n\nThere was absolutely nothing that Malone could do.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe kids were still yelling at the top of their voices, but the\nthundering of heavy, flat feet galumphing up from the lower depths\ncouldn't be ignored for long. All the boys noticed it at about the same\ntime. They jerked their heads round to face the stairway. Malone and his\ncampatriots crouched lower behind the boxes.\n\nMike Fueyo was the first to speak. \"Don't vanish yet!\" he snapped.\n\"Let's see who it is.\"\n\nThe internal dissent among the Silent Spooks disappeared as if it had\nnever been, as they faced a common foe. Once again, they fell naturally\nunder Fueyo's leadership. \"If it's cops,\" he said, \"we'll give 'em the\nGrasshopper Play we worked out. We'll show 'em.\"\n\n\"They can't fool with us,\" another boy said. \"Sure. The Grasshopper\nPlay.\"\n\nIt was cops, all right. Lieutenant Lynch ran up the stairs waving his\nbilly in a heroic fashion, followed by a horde of blue-clad officers.\n\n\"Where's Malone?\" Lynch shouted as he came through the doorway.\n\n\"Where's your what?\" Mike yelled back, and the fight was on.\n\nLater, Malone thought that he should have been surprised, but he wasn't.\nThere wasn't any time to be surprised. The kids didn't disappear. They\nspread out over the floor of the room easily and lightly, and the cops\ncharged them in a great blundering mass.\n\nNaturally, the kids winked out one by one--and reformed in the center of\nthe cops' muddle. Malone saw one cop raise his billy and swing it at\nMike. Mike watched it come down and vanish at the last instant. The\ncop's billy descended on the head of another cop, standing just behind\nwhere Mike had been.\n\nThe second cop, hit and blinded by the blow on his head, swung back and\nhit the first cop. Meanwhile, Mike was somewhere else.\n\nMalone stayed crouched behind the boxes. Dorothea stood up and shouted:\n\"Mike! Mike! We just want to talk to you!\"\n\nUnfortunately, the police were making such a racket that this could not\nbe heard more than a foot or so from the speaker. Lynch himself charged\ninto the mass, swinging his billy and his free fist and laying others\nout one after the other. Pretty soon the floor was littered with cops.\nLynch was doing yeoman duty, but it was hard to tell what side he was\non.\n\nThe vanishing trick Mike had worked out was being used by all of the\nkids. Cops were hitting other cops, Lynch was hitting everybody, and the\nkids were winking on and off all over the loft. It was a scene of\ntremendous noise and carnage.\n\nMalone suddenly sprang to his feet and charged into the melee, shouting\nat the top of his lungs and swinging both fists. The first person he saw\nwas one of the teen-agers, and he charged him with abandon.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHe should, he reflected, have known better. The kid disappeared. Malone\ncaromed off the stomach of a policeman, received a blow on the shoulder\nfrom his billy, and rebounded into the arms of a surprised police\nofficer at the edge of the battle.\n\n\"Who're you?\" the officer gasped.\n\n\"Malone,\" Malone said.\n\n\"You on our side?\"\n\n\"How about you?\" Malone said.\n\n\"I'm a lieutenant here,\" the officer said. \"In charge of warehouse\nprecinct. I--\"\n\nMalone and the lieutenant stepped nimbly aside as another cop careened\nby them, waving his billy helplessly. They looked away as the crash\ncame. The cop had fallen over a table, and now lay with his legs in the\nair, supported by the overturned table, blissfully unconscious.\n\n\"We seem,\" Malone said, \"to be in an area of some activity. Let's move.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey shifted away a few feet. Malone looked into the foray and saw Boyd\nat work roaring and going after the kids. One of them had established a\nkind of game with him. He would appear just in front of Boyd, who rushed\nat him, arms outstretched. As Boyd had almost reached him, the kid\ndisappeared and reappeared again just behind Boyd. He tapped the FBI\nagent gently on the shoulder; Boyd turned and the process was repeated.\n\nBoyd seemed to be getting winded.\n\nThe lieutenant suddenly dashed back into the fray. Malone looked around,\nsaw Mike Fueyo flickering in and out at the edges, and headed for him.\n\nA cop swung at Mike, missed, and hit Malone on the arm. Malone swore.\nThe cop backed off, looking in a bewildered fashion for his victim, who\nwas nowhere in sight. Then Malone caught sight of him, at the other edge\nof the fight. He started to work his way around.\n\nHe tried to avoid blows, but it wasn't always possible. A reeling cop\ncaught his lapel and tore it, and Lynch, indefatigable in battle,\nmanaged to graze his chin with a blow meant for one of the disappearing\nboys. Other cops were battling each other, going after the kids and\nclutching empty air, cursing and screaming unheard orders in the fracas.\n\nMalone ducked past Lynch, rubbed at his chin and looked for Mike. In the\ntangle of bodies it was getting hard to see. There was the sound of\nbreaking ceramics as a floor lamp went over, and then a table followed\nit, but Malone avoided both. He looked for Mike Fueyo--\n\nA cop clutched him around the middle, out of nowhere, said: \"Sorry,\nbuddy, who are you?\" and dove back into the mass of bodies. Malone\ncaught his breath and forged onward.\n\nThere was Mike, at the edge of the fight, watching everything coolly. No\ncop was near him. In the dim light the place looked like a scene from\nHell, a special Hell for policemen. Malone wove through battling hordes\nto the edge and came out a few feet away from Mike Fueyo.\n\nFueyo didn't see him. He was looking at Boyd instead--still stumbling\nback and forth as the teen-ager baiting him winked on and off in front\nof him and behind him. He was laughing.\n\nMalone came up silently from behind. The trip seemed to take hours. He\nwas being very quiet, although he was reasonably sure that even if he\nyelled he wouldn't be heard. But he didn't want to take the slightest\nchance.\n\nHe sprang on Mike and attached the handcuffs to his wrist, and to\nMike's wrist, within seconds.\n\n\"Ha!\" he said involuntarily. \"Now come with me!\"\n\nHe gave his end of the handcuffs a tremendous yank.\n\nHe started to stagger, trailing an empty cuff behind him, flailing his\narms wildly. Ahead of him he could see a big cop with an upraised billy.\nMalone tried to alter his course, but it was too late. He skidded\nhelplessly into the cop, who jerked round and swung the billy\nautomatically. Malone said: \"Yi!\" as he caught the blow on the\ncheekbone, bounced off the cop and kept going.\n\nHe careened past a blur of figures, trying to avoid hard surfaces and\nother human beings. But there was--\n\nOh, no, Malone thought.\n\nLynch.\n\nLynch was ready to swing. His fist was cocked, and he was heading for\none of the teen-agers with murder in his eye. Malone knew their paths\nwere going to intersect. \"Watch out!\" he yelled. \"Watch out, it's me!\nStop me! Stop me! Somebody stop me!\"\n\nHe went completely unheard.\n\nLynch swung and missed, hitting a cop who had been hiding behind the\nteen-ager. The cop went down to join the wounded, and Lynch roared like\na bull and swung around, looking for more enemies.\n\nThat was when Malone hit him.\n\nLong afterward, he remembered Lynch's hat sailing through the air, and\nlanding in the center of a struggling mass of policemen. He remembered\nLynch saying: \"So there you are!\" and swinging before he looked.\n\nHe remembered the blow on the chin.\n\nAnd then, he remembered falling, and falling, and falling. Somewhere\nthere was a voice: \"Where are they? They've disappeared for good.\"\n\nAnd then, for long seconds, nothing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe woke up with a headache, but it wasn't too bad. Surprisingly, not\nmuch time had passed; he got up and dusted off his trousers, looking\naround at the battlefield. Wounded and groaning cops were all over. The\nroom was a shambles; the walking wounded--which comprised the rest of\nthe force--were stumbling around in a slow, hopeless sort of fashion.\n\nLynch was standing next to him. \"Malone,\" he said, \"I'm sorry. I hit\nyou, didn't I?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" Malone said. \"You seemed to be hitting everybody.\"\n\n\"I was _trying_ for the kids,\" Lynch said.\n\n\"So was I,\" Malone said. \"I got the cuffs on one and yanked him\nalong--but he disappeared and left me with the cuffs.\"\n\n\"Great,\" Lynch said. \"Hell of a raid.\"\n\n\"Very jolly,\" Malone agreed. \"Fun and games were had by all.\"\n\nA cop stumbled up, handed Lynch his cap and disappeared without a word.\nLynch stared mournfully at it. The emblem was crushed and the cap looked\nrather worn and useless. He put it on his head, where it assumed the\nrakish tilt of a hobo's favorite tam-o'-shanter, and said: \"I hope\nyou're not thinking of blaming _me_ for this fiasco.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" Malone said nobly. He hurt all over, but on reflection he\nthought that he would probably live. \"It was nobody's fault.\" Except, he\nthought, his own. If he'd only told Lynch to come in when called\nfor--and under no other circumstances--this wouldn't have happened. He\nlooked around at the remains of New York's Finest, and felt guilty.\n\nThe lieutenant from the local precinct limped up, rubbing a well-kicked\nshin and trying to disentangle pieces of floor lamp from his hair.\n\"Listen, Lynch,\" he said, \"What's with these kids? What's going on here?\nLook at my men.\"\n\n\"Some days,\" Lynch said, \"it just doesn't pay to get up.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" the local man said, \"but what do I do now?\"\n\n\"Make your reports.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"To the Commissioner,\" Lynch said, \"and to nobody else. If this gets\ninto the papers, heads will roll.\"\n\n\"My head is rolling right now,\" the local man said. \"Know what one of\nthose kids did? Stood in front of a floor lamp. I swung at him and he\nvanished. Vanished. I hit the lamp, and then the lamp hit me.\"\n\n\"Just see that this doesn't get out,\" Lynch said.\n\n\"It can't,\" the local man said. \"Anybody who mentioned this to a\nreporter would just be laughed out of town. It's not possible.\" He\npaused thoughtfully, and added: \"We'd all be laughed out of town.\"\n\n\"And probably replaced with the FBI,\" Lynch said morosely. He looked at\nMalone. \"Nothing personal, you understand,\" he said.\n\n\"Of course,\" Malone said. \"We can't do any more here, can we?\"\n\n\"I don't think we can do any more anywhere,\" Lynch said. \"Let's lock the\nplace up and leave and forget all about it.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Malone said. \"I've got work to do.\" He looked round, found\nDorothea and signaled to her. \"Come on, Dorothea. Where's Boyd?\"\n\n\"Here I am,\" Boyd said, walking slowly across the big room to Malone. He\nhad one hand held to his chin.\n\n\"What's the matter with you?\" Malone asked.\n\nBoyd took his hand away. There was a bald spot the size of a quarter on\nthe point of his chin. \"One of those kids,\" he said sadly, \"has a hell\nof a strong grip. Come on, Miss Fueyo. Come on, Malone. Let's get out of\nhere.\"\n\n\n\n\nXV.\n\n\nIt is definitely not usual for the Director of the FBI to come stalking\ninto a local office of that same FBI without so much as an advance\nwarning or a by-your-leave. Such things are simply not done.\n\nAndrew J. Burris, however, was doing them.\n\nThree days after the Great Warehouse Fiasco, a startled A-in-C looked up\nto see the familiar Burris figure stalk by his office, growling under\nits breath. The A-in-C leaped to the interoffice phone, wondered whom he\nought to call first, and subsided, staring dully at the telephone screen\nand thinking about retiring.\n\nThe next appearance of the head of the FBI was in the office assigned to\nMalone and Boyd. Burris came through the doorway without warning, his\ncountenance that of a harried and unhappy man.\n\nMalone looked up, blinked, and then readjusted his features to what he\nimagined was a nice, bright smile. \"Oh,\" he said. \"Hello, chief. I've\nbeen sort of expecting you.\"\n\n\"I'll bet you have,\" Burris said. He set his brief case on Malone's desk\nand pulled a sheaf of papers from it. \"Do you see these?\" he said,\nwaving them. \"Inquiries. Complaints. Demands. From everybody. I've been\ngetting them for three days.\"\n\n\"Sure are a lot of them,\" Malone said at random.\n\n\"From Police Commissioner Fernack,\" Burris said. \"From the mayor. From\nthe governor, in Albany. From everybody. And they all want an\nexplanation. They demand one.\"\n\nHe sat down suddenly on Malone's desk, his anger gone.\n\n\"Well--\" Malone began.\n\n\"Malone,\" Burris said plaintively, \"I can stall them off for a while. I\ncan tell them all kinds of fancy stories. I don't mind. They don't\nreally need any explanation. But--\" He paused, and then added: \"I do!\"\n\nMalone closed his eyes, decided things looked even worse that way, and\nopened them again. \"Just what sort of an explanation did you have in\nmind, chief?\" he said.\n\n\"Any kind,\" Burris said instantly, \"so long as it explains. I ... no.\"\n\n\"No?\"\n\n\"No,\" Burris said. \"I want the truth! Even if it doesn't explain\nanything! Preferably, I want both--the truth and some explanations. If\npossible. For three days, now, this area has been haunted by the Silent\nSpooks. They've been stealing everything they could carry off! They've\ngot the whole city in an uproar!\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said. \"Not exactly. The papers--\"\n\n\"I know,\" Burris said. \"You've kept it out of the news. That's fine, and\nI appreciate it, Malone. I really do. But I can't sit around and\nappreciate it much longer. You've got to get those boys!\" He bounced off\nthe desk and stood up again. \"The longer they keep this up,\" he said,\n\"the harder it's going to be to square everything with the courts. Those\nkids may end up getting killed! And how would that be?\"\n\n\"Terrible,\" Malone said honestly.\n\n\"Something,\" Burris summed up, \"has to be done.\"\n\nMalone thought for a second. \"Chief,\" he said at last, \"if you can think\nof any way to nab them, I'll certainly be grateful.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Burris said. \"Oh. No. No, Malone. This is your baby.\" He leaned\nover and clapped Malone on the shoulder. \"I have faith in you,\" he said.\n\"You cleared up that nutty telepath case and you can clear this one up,\ntoo. But you've got to do it soon!\"\n\n\"I'm working on it,\" Malone said helplessly. \"We might get a lead any\ntime now.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Burris said. \"Meanwhile, let's sit down and see if we can't\nfigure out a way to pacify the local bigwigs.\"\n\nMalone sighed wearily.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAn hour later, he was even more tired. Letting himself into his room at\nthe hotel, he felt completely exhausted. He had spent most of the hour\ntactfully trying to get away from Burris. It had not been the world's\neasiest job.\n\nDorothea Fueyo was sitting on the couch, waiting for him.\n\nImmediately, he felt much better.\n\n\"You're late,\" Dorothea said accusingly. \"I had to come up with the\nduplicate key you gave me. And what are the bellboys going to think?\"\n\n\"They're going to think you had a duplicate key,\" Malone said. \"Anyhow,\nI'm sorry. I got delayed at the office. Burris came to town--delivering\nseventeen ultimatums, forty-nine conflicting sets of orders and a\nrousing lecture.\"\n\n\"I could have come up to your office, then,\" Dorothea said, \"instead of\ncompromising my reputation by sneaking up to your hotel room.\"\n\n\"And what about _my_ reputation?\" Malone said. \"Besides, the office is\nno place for what I have in mind.\"\n\n\"Why, Mr. Malone!\"\n\nMalone ignored the comment. \"Did you bring the notebook?\" he said.\n\n\"Certainly.\" Dorothea handed a black, plastic-bound notebook over to\nMalone. \"But what's all this with a notebook? Going to keep score?\"\n\n\"Not exactly,\" Malone said. He took the notebook and leafed through it\nidly. It was not Mike Fueyo's book; the boy himself had that now, and\nthere was little chance of getting it back again. This one belonged to\nDorothea--but, Malone thought, it could serve the same purpose.\n\n\"What I have in mind,\" he said, \"is something Mike said the other night,\njust before the cops barged in. He said something about having tried to\nteach you the Vanish. And that's why I asked you to come here. Did he\nteach you?\"\n\n\"Well, he tried,\" Dorothea said. \"But I couldn't do anything with it. I\nhaven't got the Talent, Mike says.\" She paused. \"Is that why you figured\nI had a notebook like his?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"It's the only thing that makes sense. Mike's\nnotebook was full of symbols--and that was all they could be. Symbols.\nIf you see what I mean.\"\n\n\"Not exactly,\" Dorothea said.\n\n\"Symbolism--anyhow, that's what Dr. O'Connor says--is one of the\nprimary factors in psionics.\"\n\n\"Dr.... oh, yes,\" Dorothea said. \"Westinghouse. I've heard about him.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Malone said. \"Anyhow, I decided the pictures in Mike's notebook\nwere just that--symbols. Things he wanted. And the little squiggles\nafter the names were symbols, too. You know,\" Malone said, \"the boy's\npretty smart. Nobody else that I know of has ever figured out a way to\nteach psionics--at least, not on that level. But Mike has.\"\n\n\"He's a good boy,\" Dorothea said. \"Basically.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Malone said. \"Anyhow, if that were true, then the notebook was\nsome sort of guide. And if he tried to teach you the technique, then you\nhad to have a notebook, too. Clear?\"\n\n\"Perfectly,\" Dorothea said, \"so what do you want me to do?\"\n\n\"Teach me,\" Malone said.\n\nThere was a silence.\n\n\"That's silly,\" Dorothea said. \"How can I teach you something I can't do\nmyself? Besides, how do you know you have the Talent?\"\n\n\"As far as the second question goes, I don't know. But I can try, can't\nI? And as far as the first question goes, that might not be so simple.\nBut I think it can be done--if you remember what Mike tried to teach\nyou.\"\n\n\"Oh, I can remember all of that,\" she said, \"but it's just that it\ndidn't do me any good. I couldn't use it.\"\n\n\"A man who's paralyzed from the waist,\" Malone said hopefully, \"can't\nplay football. But if he knows how the game's played, he can teach\nothers--anyhow, he can teach the fundamentals. Want to try?\"\n\nDorothea smiled. \"All right, Ken,\" she said. \"It's a great idea, at\nthat: the blind teaching the possibly-blind to read. Give me the\nnotebook, and I'll explain the first principles. Later, you'll have to\nget a notebook of your own, because these symbols are very\npersonalized.\"\n\nMalone grinned and pulled a black book from his pocket. \"I thought they\nmight be,\" he said. \"I've already got one. Let's go.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n[Illustration]\n\nSweating, Malone stared grimly at the picture he had drawn on a page of\nhis notebook. He'd been trying the stunt for four days, and so far all\nhe had achieved was a nice profusion of perspiration. He was beginning\nto feel like an ad for a Turkish bath.\n\n\"No, Ken,\" Dorothea said patiently. \"No. You can't do it that way.\nYou've got to _visualize_ it. That's how Mike could find red Cadillacs\nso easily. All he had to do was--\"\n\n\"I know,\" Malone said, impatiently. \"That's what the pictures are for.\nBut I'm no artist. This doesn't even look much _like_ my office.\"\n\n\"It doesn't have to, Ken,\" Dorothea said. \"All it has to do is give you\nenough details to enable you to visualize your destination. The better\nyour memory is, the less detail you need. But you've got to grasp the\nwhole area in your mind.\"\n\nMalone lifted his eyes from the book and stared into the darkness\noutside the window without seeing it. Midnight had come and gone a long\ntime ago, and he was still working.\n\n\"If I don't crack this case pretty soon,\" he muttered, \"Burris is going\nto find a special new assignment for me--like investigating the social\nlife of a deserted space station.\"\n\n\"Now, that's just what's bothering you,\" Dorothea said. \"Get your mind\noff Burris. You can't teleport when your mind is occupied with other\nthings.\"\n\n\"Then how did the kids hop around so much during the fight at the\nwarehouse?\"\n\n\"Plenty of practice,\" Dorothea said. \"They've been doing it longer than\nyou have. It's like playing the piano. The beginner has to concentrate,\nbut the expert can play a piece he's familiar with and hold a\nconversation at the same time. Now stop worrying--and start\nconcentrating.\"\n\nMalone looked at the book again. With an effort, he forced everything\nout of his mind except the picture. Burris' face came back once or\ntwice, but he managed to get rid of it. He looked at the lopsided\ndrawings that represented various items in the room, and made himself\nconcentrate solely on visualizing the objects themselves and their\nsurroundings.\n\nThen, as the picture became clearer and achieved more reality, he began\ngoing over the other mental exercises that Dorothea had taught him.\n\nHe heard a clock tick.\n\nIt was gone.\n\nThere was nothing but the picture, and the room it stood for ... nothing\n... nothing....\n\nThe lights went out.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMalone blinked and jerked his head up from the notebook. \"What hap--\" he\nbegan.\n\nAnd then he stopped.\n\nHe was no longer in his hotel room at the Statler-Hilton. He was\nstanding in the middle of his office at FBI headquarters, Washington,\nD.C.\n\nIt had worked!\n\nMalone walked over to the wall switch and turned on the lights in the\ndarkened room. He looked around. He was definitely in his office.\n\nHe was a teleport.\n\nHe blinked and wondered briefly if he were dreaming. He pinched himself,\nsaid: \"Ow,\" and decided that the pain offered no certain proof.\n\nBut he didn't feel like part of a dream.\n\nHe felt real. So did the office.\n\nJust as he had promised Dorothea, he went to the phone and dialed the\nStatler-Hilton.\n\nIt took a minute for the long-distance circuits to connect him with\nManhattan. Then the pretty operator at the hotel was smiling at him from\nthe screen. \"Statler-Hilton Hotel,\" she said. \"May we help you?\"\n\n\"Ring Room 814,\" Malone said. \"I'm probably asleep in it.\"\n\n\"What?\" the operator said.\n\n\"Never mind,\" Malone said. \"Just ring it.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" The screen went blank.\n\nThe screen stayed blank for a long time.\n\nAnd then the operator was back. \"I'm sorry, sir,\" she said. \"That room\ndoesn't answer.\"\n\n\"You're sure?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Try it again,\" Malone said.\n\nThe operator did so. She returned with the same answer.\n\nMalone frowned and hung up. It didn't sound right. Even a dream was\nsupposed to make more sense than this was making. There was something\nwrong.\n\nHe had to get back to the hotel room.\n\nThere was only one trouble. He didn't have a picture of the room in his\nnotebook.\n\nDorothea had said that it was almost impossible to go to a place one\nhadn't been to before. Mike Fueyo had been able to pick up any red\nCadillac in the city because he'd concentrated solely on the symbol of a\nred Cadillac. But he never knew which Cadillac he'd end up at.\n\nMalone closed his eyes and tried to remember the hotel room. He\nhalf-wished he had a photograph of it, but Dorothea had told him that\nphotos wouldn't work. They were too complete; they required no effort of\nthe mind. Only a symbol would do.\n\nOf course, the job could be done without a symbol by somebody who'd had\nplenty of practice. But Malone had made exactly one jump. Could he do\nit the second time with nothing to work with except his own recollection\nand visualization of the room?\n\nHe didn't know, but he was certainly going to try. He had to.\n\nSomething was wrong; something had happened to Dorothea.\n\nHe tried to imagine what it could be, and then realized that such\nthoughts were only delaying him by distracting his mind from its main\njob.\n\nHe kept his eyes tightly closed and tried to form the picture in his\nmind. The couch--there. The dresser--over there. The easy-chair, the\nrug, the walls, the table--wait a minute: he was losing the couch.\nThere. Now. The table, the desk--all there. In color. And in detail.\n\nSlowly they came, and he held them in place, visualizing his hotel room\njust as he had visualized his office minutes before. He concentrated.\nHarder. Harder. _Harder._ HAR--\n\n\"Sir Kenneth!\" a voice said. \"Will you please stop standing there with\nyour eyes closed and help me with this poor child? She's fainted.\"\n\nMalone's eyes popped open, but for a minute he wasn't entirely sure he'd\nopened them. His visualization blended almost perfectly with the reality\nof the room around him. There was only one jarring difference.\n\nHe had certainly never visualized the richly-dressed figure of Queen\nElizabeth I standing in the center of the room.\n\n\"Now, now,\" she said. \"Thinking like that can only lead to confusion.\nCome over here and help me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDorothea was on the couch. Between them, they managed to wake her\ngently, and she sat up and stared around at them and the room. \"I'm\nsorry,\" she said dazedly. \"It's just that I didn't expect you to turn\ninto a little old lady in Elizabethan costume. Just a bit\ndisconcerting.\" She blinked. \"By the way, who is she?\"\n\n\"This,\" Malone said with a sense of some foreboding, \"is Queen Elizabeth\nI.\"\n\n\"She's dead,\" Dorothea said decisively.\n\n\"Not really, my dear,\" the Queen said. \"Actually, you see ... well, it's\ntoo long to explain now.\" She gave everybody a bland smile.\n\n\"She's nuts, then,\" Dorothea said. \"She is nuts, isn't she? Because if\nshe isn't, I am.\"\n\n\"You're not crazy,\" Malone told her diplomatically. \"But she--\" He\nstopped. How could he explain everything, in front of the Queen herself?\n\n\"Don't worry about it,\" Her Majesty said. \"Dorothea is a little\nconfused--but it hardly matters. Perhaps there are other things to do.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said uncertainly. \"By the way, how did you get here?\"\n\n\"Now, why do you ask that?\" the Queen said. \"You've already figured it\nall out, Sir Kenneth.\"\n\n\"I don't get it,\" Dorothea put in.\n\n\"Simple,\" Malone said. \"She's telepathic. She's been listening in on our\nsessions for the past four days--she must have been. So now she can\nteleport, too.\"\n\nDorothea looked at the little old lady in awe. \"But how could you come\nto a place you'd never been to before?\"\n\n\"I got all the information I needed, my dear, out of Sir Kenneth's\nmind.\"\n\n\"Sir Kenneth?\" Dorothea said. \"Sir ... Ken? His mind?\"\n\n\"Never mind it,\" Malone said. \"What do I do now?\"\n\nHer Majesty said: \"Don't worry about anything. And use your own psionic\ntalents. You can catch those dear boys now, you know. You're better than\nthey are.\"\n\n\"Me?\" Malone said. \"But they've had--\"\n\n\"Practice, of course,\" the Queen said. \"But you have a talent they\ndon't.\"\n\n\"I do?\"\n\n\"Well,\" the Queen said, \"you've been calling it 'luck' for years. You're\nmuch too modest, Sir Kenneth. If you'll think back, you'll remember that\nevery time you had a bit of your so-called luck, it was because you were\nat the right place at the right time. There's no other way to explain\nthe fact that you wandered at random through Greenwich Village--of all\nplaces!--and just happened to end up at the very same red Cadillac that\nyoung Mike was going to come to--_before he got there_!\"\n\nMalone felt the back of his head. \"That,\" he said, \"was luck?\"\n\n\"You got the notebook, didn't you?\" the Queen said. \"But of course it\nwasn't luck. It's prescience--the ability to predict the future. You've\nhad it all along, but you haven't been consciously using it. The only\nway you'll ever catch those boys is to know where they're going to be\nbefore they get there.\"\n\nMalone sat down heavily on the couch next to Dorothea. His mind was\nwhirling with a fine, dizzy rapidity. In a few seconds he was going to\ntry and grab the brass ring.\n\n\"Oh, I'll help you,\" the Queen added. \"Don't worry about that. I think I\ncan pick up Mike's mind, now that I'm closer to him. And if we can\nfigure out what their plans are, and where they're going to be, we can\nnab them all, Sir Kenneth. Won't that be nice?\"\n\n\"Ducky,\" Malone said. \"Simply ducky. All I have to do is predict the\nfuture while you read minds and we both teleport. And Dorothea can sit\naround sticking pins in dolls, I guess. Or--\"\n\n\"Well, now,\" the Queen said, \"I don't know. Perhaps she just doesn't\nhave that talent. Besides, why would we want to do anything like that?\nIt seems to me--\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" Malone said hopelessly. \"If we're going to do anything,\nlet's get started.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwelve hours later, Kenneth J. Malone was sitting quietly in a small\nroom at the rear of a sporting-goods store on upper Madison Avenue,\ntrying to remain calm and hoping that the finest, most beautiful and\ncomplete hunch--only now it wasn't a \"hunch\" any more, he reminded\nhimself; now it was prescience--was going to pay off. With him were Boyd\nand two agents from the Sixty-ninth Street office. They were sitting\nquietly, too, but there was a sense of enormous excitement in the air.\nMalone wanted to get up and walk around, but he didn't dare. He clamped\nhis hands in his lap and sat tight.\n\nThey waited in silence, not daring to talk. There wasn't a sound in the\nroom. Malone felt like screaming, but he managed to control himself with\nan effort.\n\nThere was no reason why the plan shouldn't work, Malone told himself.\nAccording to all the theory he knew, it was fool proof. Her Majesty had\nno doubts about it, either. She assured him that he had prescience, and\nseveral other powers as well. Unfortunately, Malone wasn't quite as sure\nas she was.\n\nEven if the theory seemed to back her up, he thought, there was still a\nchance that she was wrong, and the theory was wrong, and everything was\nwrong. His hunch--prescience, if you wanted to call it that, he\namended--said definitely that this would be the place the Spooks would\nhit tonight. Her Majesty was quite sure of it. And Malone couldn't think\nof a single really good reason why either of them might be wrong. But\nmaybe he'd got the address mixed up. Maybe the Spooks were somewhere\nelse right now, robbing what they pleased, safe from capture--\n\nIt doesn't do much good to know where a teleporter _is_, Malone thought.\nBut it's extremely handy to know where he's going to be. And if you also\nknow what he plans to do when he gets where he's going, you've got an\nabsolute lead-pipe cinch to work with.\n\nThe Queen and Malone had provided that lead-pipe cinch. They were sure\nthat Mike planned to raid the sporting-goods store with the rest of the\nSpooks that night.\n\nBut, of course, they might all just be riding for some kind of horrible,\nunforeseen fall--\n\nThe main part of the sporting-goods store was fairly well lit, even at\nnight, though it was by no means brightly illuminated. There were\nshow-window lights on, and the street lamp from outside cast a nice\nglow. Malone was grateful for that. But the back room was dark, and the\nfour men there were well-concealed. A curtain closed the room off, and\nMalone watched the front of the store through a narrow opening in it. He\nstared until his eyes ached, afraid to blink in case he missed the\nappearance of the Spooks. Everything had to go off just right, precisely\non schedule.\n\nAnd it was going to happen any minute, he told himself nervously. In\njust a few minutes, everything would be over.\n\nMalone held his breath.\n\nThen he saw the figure walk slowly by the glass front of the shop,\nlooking in with over-elaborate casualness. He was casing the joint,\nmaking sure there was no one left in it.\n\nMike Fueyo.\n\nMalone tried to breathe, and couldn't.\n\nSeconds ticked by.\n\nAnd then--almost magically--they appeared. Eight of them, almost\nsimultaneously, in the center of the room.\n\nMike Fueyo spoke in a low, controlled voice. \"O.K., now,\" he said.\n\"Let's move fast. We haven't got much time. We--\"\n\nAnd that was all he said.\n\nMalone concentrated on just one thing: holding an image of the room,\nwith the eight Spooks in it.\n\nThere was a long second of silence.\n\nMalone felt a bead of sweat trickle down his cheek. He held the image.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" the tallest boy said suddenly--Ramon Otravez, Malone\nremembered. \"What's wrong, Mike?\"\n\nMike let out his breath in a ragged sigh. \"I ... don't know,\" he said\nslowly. \"I can't move--\"\n\n\"It's a trap!\" another boy shouted.\n\nMalone bore down. He could feel power draining out of him, but he held\non, willing the boys to remain in the room, blanking out their own\nteleportative abilities with his stronger ones.\n\nThe eight boys stood, frozen, in the center of the lit room.\n\nMalone let another second go by, and then he stepped out from behind the\ncurtains.\n\n\"Hello, boys,\" he said casually.\n\nMike stared at him. \"It's Malone,\" he said.\n\n\"That's right,\" Malone said. \"Hello, Mike. I've been waiting for you.\"\n\nMike gulped. \"You found us,\" he said. \"Somebody talked.\"\n\nMalone shook his head. \"Nobody talked,\" he said. Concentration was\ngetting easier; the longer the situation remained the same, the less\npower it took to keep it that way. He wished he had brought a cigar, and\ncompromised by fishing out a cigarette and lighting it.\n\nMike said: \"But--\" and was silent.\n\n\"I knew where you were going to be,\" Malone said. \"You see, I've got a\nfew--powers of my own, Mike.\"\n\nRamon Otravez said: \"He's kidding. It's some kind of a trick.\"\n\n\"Shut up,\" Mike told him.\n\n\"It's no trick,\" Malone said. \"I've been waiting for you for quite a\nwhile, boys.\" He paused. \"And you can't move, can you? I've taken care\nof that.\"\n\n\"Some kind of gas,\" Mike said instantly.\n\n\"Gas?\" Malone said. \"Nope.\" He shook his head.\n\n\"Electricity,\" Mike said. It sounded desperate. \"Some gimmick you've got\nset up back there behind the curtain, to--\"\n\n\"No gimmick,\" Malone said. \"It's just that I know a couple of tricks,\ntoo--and I'm a little better at them than you are.\" The next minute was\ngoing to be difficult, he knew, but it had to be done. He \"froze\" the\npicture of the room in his mind and, at the same time, pictured himself\nat the other side of the room. He made the effort, and at first nothing\nhappened. Then--\n\n\"You can do the Vanish,\" Mike said, very slowly and softly.\n\n\"Oh, I can do more than that,\" Malone said cheerfully from the other\nside of the room. \"I can do the Vanish, and I can also keep you from\ndoing it. Right?\"\n\nIt hung in the balance for a second, but Malone was barely worried about\nthe final outcome. He'd beaten the boys, not with scientific gadgetry or\ntrickery, but at their own game. He'd done it simply, easily and\ncompletely. And for boys who were sure they were something very special,\nboys who'd never been beaten on their own grounds before, the shock was\nconsiderable.\n\nMalone knew, even before Mike said: \"I guess so,\" in a defeated voice,\nthat he had won.\n\n\"Now,\" he said briskly, \"you boys are going to come down to the FBI\noffices with me. And you're not going to try any tricks--because you\ncan't get away with a thing, and you know you can't. I've just proven\nthat to you.\"\n\n\"I guess you have,\" Mike said.\n\nMalone beckoned the three other men out of the back room and then, under\nhis watchful guidance, the procession started for the street.\n\n\n\n\nXVI\n\n\n\"The only thing we had to worry about,\" Malone said, pouring some more\nchampagne into the hollow-stemmed glasses, \"was whether the theory would\nactually prove out in practice. From all we knew, it seemed logical that\nI could concentrate on the room with the boys in it, and by that\nconcentration prevent them from teleporting out--but there's a lot we\ndon't know, too. And it didn't damage the kids any.\"\n\nDorothea relaxed in her chair and looked around at the hotel room walls\nwith contentment. \"Mike seemed pretty normal--except that he had that\nawful _trapped_ feeling.\"\n\nMalone handed her one of the filled glasses with an air. He was\nbeginning slowly to feel less like the nervous, uncertain Kenneth J.\nMalone and more and more like good old Sir Kenneth Malone. \"I can see\nwhy he felt trapped,\" he said. \"If a guy's been unhampered by four walls\nall the time, even for only a year or so, he's certainly going to feel\npenned in when he's stopped from going through them. Especially when\nwhat stops him is just what he has--only more of the same. It might be a\nlittle ego-crushing, and just a trifle claustrophobic.\"\n\n\"The main thing is,\" Dorothea said, \"that everybody's so happy.\nCommissioner Fernack, even--with Mr. Burris promising to give him a\nmedal.\"\n\n\"And Lynch,\" Malone said reflectively. \"He'll get a promotion out of\nthis for sure. And good old Kettleman.\"\n\n\"Kettleman,\" Dorothea said. \"Oh, sure. He's some kind of social worker,\nisn't he? Only we never knew what kind.\"\n\n\"And now he's getting a scroll from the FBI,\" Malone said. \"A citation\nfor coming up with the essential clue in this case. Even though he\ndidn't know it _was_ the essential clue. You know,\" he added\nreflectively, \"one thing puzzles me about that man.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"he worked in your neighborhood. You knew him.\"\n\n\"Of course I did,\" Dorothea said. \"We all knew Kettleman.\"\n\n\"He said he had a lot of success as a social worker,\" Malone said. \"Now,\nI've met him. And talked with him. And I just can't picture--\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Dorothea said. \"We keep him around--kept him around, I mean--as a\nsort of joke. A pet, or a mascot. Of course, he never did catch on. I\ndon't suppose he has yet.\"\n\nMalone laughed. \"Nope,\" he said. \"He hasn't.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Mike,\" Dorothea said.\n\n\"Mike what?\"\n\n\"Mike,\" she repeated. \"He's probably the happiest of all. After Mom and\nI talked to him for a while, anyhow, and he began to ... to get used to\nthings. Now he's excited about being an FBI man.\" She looked worriedly\nat Malone for a second. \"You weren't kidding about that, were you?\" she\nasked.\n\nShe looked very pretty when she was worried, Malone decided. He leaned\nover and kissed her with great care. After a while he said: \"You were\nsaying?\"\n\n\"Was I?\" Dorothea said. \"Oh, yes. I was. About Mike being an FBI man.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"Well, normally you've got to be a lawyer or an\naccountant, but there are a few special cases. And maybe Mike would fit\nin to the special-case bracket. If he doesn't--well, he'll be doing some\nkind of official work for the Government.\"\n\n\"What about Her Majesty, or whatever she is?\" Dorothea asked. \"Is\nshe--convinced that teleportation's no good, the way Mike is?\"\n\nMalone looked unhappy. \"I wish you hadn't mentioned it,\" he said.\n\n\"Then what will you do?\" Dorothea said.\n\n\"Burris has it all down pat,\" Malone said bitterly. \"Since I'm the only\none who can predict where she's going to be, I'm going to be her\npermanent bodyguard from now on. She's promised me that she won't go\nteleporting all over the place--but we won't be able to keep her locked\nup all the time, either. So: whither she goes, I go--first.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Dorothea said, \"don't feel bad. After all, you did what you set\nout to do.\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Sure you did,\" Dorothea said. \"You got the boys. And they won't feel\nso bad after they get used to it.\"\n\n\"I suppose not,\" Malone said. \"We had to prove one thing to them,\nanyway. We can stop them at any time. You see, they've got to think\nabout teleporting, and as soon as they do that one of our\ntelepaths--like Her Majesty or me, I guess--will know what they're\nthinking. And we can 'freeze' them. I mean, I can.\"\n\n\"It sounds all right,\" Dorothea said.\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"After all, we did them quite a favor--getting them\nout of all the trouble they'd gotten themselves into.\"\n\n\"That reminds me, Ken,\" Dorothea said. \"All the things that were stolen.\nThe liquor and all of that. Money. What's going to happen to that?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"everything that can be returned--and that includes\nmost of the liquor, because they hadn't had a chance to get rid of it to\nthe bootleggers around this area--will be returned. What can't be\nreturned--money, stuff they've used, broken or sold--well, I don't\nexactly know about that. It might take a special act of Congress,\" he\nsaid brightly.\n\n\"All for the boys?\" Dorothea said.\n\n\"Well, they'll be at Yucca Flats,\" Malone said, \"and they'll be pretty\nuseful. And, as I said before we started all this, if they try to run\naway from Yucca Flats we'll just have to keep them 'frozen' all the\ntime. I mean, I will. Little as we want to. They can be of some use that\nway, too. The Government isn't doing all this for nothing.\"\n\n\"But keeping them 'frozen'--\"\n\n\"I said we didn't want to do it. And I don't think we'll have to.\nThey'll be well taken care of, don't worry. Some of the best\npsychiatrists and doctors are out there. And Mike and the others--if\nthey can show they're trustworthy--can come home every weekend, or even\nevery night if they can teleport that far.\" Malone paused. \"But it isn't\ncharity,\" he added. \"We need people with specialized psionic\nabilities--and, for a variety of reasons, they're pretty hard to find.\"\n\n\"You know,\" Dorothea said, \"you're pretty wonderful, Mr. Malone.\"\n\nMalone didn't answer her. He just kissed her again.\n\nDorothea pushed him gently away. \"I'm envious,\" she announced.\n\"Everybody gets a reward but me. Do I get left out just because I swiped\nyour notebook?\"\n\nMalone kissed her again. \"What kind of a reward do you want?\"\n\nShe sighed. \"Oh, well,\" she said, \"I suppose this is good enough.\"\n\n\"Good enough?\" Malone said. \"Just good enough?\"\n\nHis lips met hers for the fifth time. She reached one hand gently out to\nthe light switch and pushed it.\n\nThe lights went out.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Out Like a Light, by Gordon Randall Garrett\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OUT LIKE A LIGHT ***\n\n***** This file should be named 24444-8.txt or 24444-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/4/4/24444/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Greg Bergquist, Bruce Albrecht and\nthe Online Distributed Proofreading Team at\nhttp://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
