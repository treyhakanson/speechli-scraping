I'm not your father's ghost, even if I do look a bit\nlike him. But it's a longish story, and you might as well let me in.\nYou will, you know, so why quibble about it? At least, you always\nhave ... or do ... or will. I don't know, verbs get all mixed up. We\ndon't have the right attitude toward tenses for a situation like this.\n\nAnyhow, you'll let me in. I did, so you will.\n\nThanks. You think you're crazy, of course, but you'll find out you\naren't. It's just that things are a bit confused. And don't look at the\nmachine out there too long--until you get used to it, you'll find it's\nhard on the eyes, trying to follow where the vanes go. You'll get used\nto it, of course, but it will take about thirty years.\n\nYou're wondering whether to give me a drink, as I remember it. Why not?\nAnd naturally, since we have the same tastes, you can make the same for\nme as you're having. Of course we have the same tastes--we're the same\nperson. I'm you thirty years from now, or you're me. I remember just\nhow you feel; I felt the same way when he--that is, of course, I or\nwe--came back to tell me about it, thirty years ago.\n\nHere, have one of these. You'll get to like them in a couple more\nyears. And you can look at the revenue stamp date, if you still doubt\nmy story. You'll believe it eventually, though, so it doesn't matter.\n\nRight now, you're shocked. It's a real wrench when a man meets himself\nfor the first time. Some kind of telepathy seems to work between two\nof the same people. You _sense_ things. So I'll simply go ahead talking\nfor half an hour or so, until you get over it. After that you'll come\nalong with me. You know, I could try to change things around by telling\nwhat happened to me; but he--I--told me what I was going to do, so I\nmight as well do the same. I probably couldn't help telling you the\nsame thing in the same words, even if I tried--and I don't intend to\ntry. I've gotten past that stage in worrying about all this.\n\nSo let's begin when you get up in half an hour and come out with me.\nYou'll take a closer look at the machine, then. Yes, it'll be pretty\nobvious it must be a time machine. You'll sense that, too. You've seen\nit, just a small little cage with two seats, a luggage compartment, and\na few buttons on a dash. You'll be puzzling over what I'll tell you,\nand you'll be getting used to the idea that you are the man who makes\natomic power practical. Jerome Boell, just a plain engineer, the man\nwho put atomic power in every home. You won't exactly believe it, but\nyou'll want to go along.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI'll be tired of talking by then, and in a hurry to get going. So I\ncut off your questions, and get you inside. I snap on a green button,\nand everything seems to cut off around us. You can see a sort of\nfoggy nothing surrounding the cockpit; it is probably the field that\nprevents passage through time from affecting us. The luggage section\nisn't protected, though.\n\nYou start to say something, but by then I'm pressing a black button,\nand everything outside will disappear. You look for your house, but\nit isn't there. There is exactly nothing there--in fact, there is no\n_there_. You are completely outside of time and space, as best you can\nguess how things are.\n\nYou can't feel any motion, of course. You try to reach a hand out\nthrough the field into the nothing around you and your hand goes out,\nall right, but nothing happens. Where the screen ends, your hand just\nturns over and pokes back at you. Doesn't hurt, and when you pull your\narm back, you're still sound and uninjured. But it looks frightening\nand you don't try it again.\n\nThen it comes to you slowly that you're actually traveling in time.\nYou turn to me, getting used to the idea. \"So this is the fourth\ndimension?\" you ask.\n\nThen you feel silly, because you'll remember that I said you'd ask\nthat. Well, I asked it after I was told, then I came back and told it\nto you, and I still can't help answering when you speak.\n\n\"Not exactly,\" I try to explain. \"Maybe it's no dimension--or it might\nbe the fifth; if you're going to skip over the so-called fourth without\ntraveling along it, you'd need a fifth. Don't ask me. I didn't invent\nthe machine and I don't understand it.\"\n\n\"But....\"\n\nI let it go, and so do you. If you don't, it's a good way of going\ncrazy. You'll see later why I couldn't have invented the machine. Of\ncourse, there may have been a start for all this once. There may have\nbeen a time when you did invent the machine--the atomic motor first,\nthen the time-machine. And when you closed the loop by going back and\nsaving yourself the trouble, it got all tangled up. I figured out once\nthat such a universe would need some seven or eight time and space\ndimensions. It's simpler just to figure that this is the way time got\nbent back on itself. Maybe there is no machine, and it's just easier\nfor us to imagine it. When you spend thirty years thinking about it, as\nI did--and you will--you get further and further from an answer.\n\nAnyhow, you sit there, watching nothing all around you, and no time,\napparently, though there is a time effect back in the luggage space.\nYou look at your watch and it's still running. That means you either\ncarry a small time field with you, or you are catching a small\nincrement of time from the main field. I don't know, and you won't\nthink about that then, either.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI'm smoking, and so are you, and the air in the machine is getting a\nbit stale. You suddenly realize that everything in the machine is wide\nopen, yet you haven't seen any effects of air loss.\n\n\"Where are we getting our air?\" you ask. \"Or why don't we lose it?\"\n\n\"No place for it to go,\" I explain. There isn't. Out there is neither\ntime nor space, apparently. How could the air leak out? You still feel\ngravity, but I can't explain that, either. Maybe the machine has a\ngravity field built in, or maybe the time that makes your watch run is\nresponsible for gravity. In spite of Einstein, you have always had the\nidea that time is an effect of gravity, and I sort of agree, still.\n\nThen the machine stops--at least, the field around us cuts off. You\nfeel a dankish sort of air replace the stale air, and you breathe\neasier, though we're in complete darkness, except for the weak light in\nthe machine, which always burns, and a few feet of rough dirty cement\nfloor around. You take another cigaret from me and you get out of the\nmachine, just as I do.\n\nI've got a bundle of clothes and I start changing. It's a sort\nof simple, short-limbed, one-piece affair I put on, but it feels\ncomfortable.\n\n\"I'm staying here,\" I tell you. \"This is like the things they wear in\nthis century, as near as I can remember it, and I should be able to\npass fairly well. I've had all my fortune--the one you make on that\natomic generator--invested in such a way I can get it on using some\nidentification I've got with me, so I'll do all right. I know they\nstill use some kind of money, you'll see evidence of that. And it's a\npretty easygoing civilization, from what I could see. We'll go up and\nI'll leave you. I like the looks of things here, so I won't be coming\nback with you.\"\n\nYou nod, remembering I've told you about it. \"What century is this,\nanyway?\"\n\nI'd told you that, too, but you've forgotten. \"As near as I can guess,\nit's about 2150. He told me, just as I'm telling you, that it's an\ninterstellar civilization.\"\n\nYou take another cigaret from me, and follow me. I've got a small\nflashlight and we grope through a pile of rubbish, out into a corridor.\nThis is a sub-sub-sub-basement. We have to walk up a flight of stairs,\nand there is an elevator waiting, fortunately with the door open.\n\n\"What about the time machine?\" you ask.\n\n\"Since nobody ever stole it, it's safe.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe get in the elevator, and I say \"first\" to it. It gives out a\ncoughing noise and the basement openings begin to click by us. There's\nno feeling of acceleration--some kind of false gravity they use in the\nfuture. Then the door opens, and the elevator says \"first\" back at us.\n\nIt's obviously a service elevator and we're in a dim corridor, with\nnobody around. I grab your hand and shake it. \"You go that way. Don't\nworry about getting lost; you never did, so you can't. Find the museum,\ngrab the motor, and get out. And good luck to you.\"\n\nYou act as if you're dreaming, though you can't believe it's a dream.\nYou nod at me and I move out into the main corridor. A second later,\nyou see me going by, mixed into a crowd that is loafing along toward\na restaurant, or something like it, that is just opening. I'm asking\nquestions of a man, who points, and I turn and move off.\n\nYou come out of the side corridor and go down a hall, away from the\nrestaurant. There are quiet little signs along the hall. You look at\nthem, realizing for the first time that things have changed.\n\n_Steij:neri, Faunten, Z:rgat Dispenseri._ The signs are very quiet and\ndignified. Some of them can be decoded to stationery shops, fountains,\nand the like. What a zergot is, you don't know. You stop at a sign\nthat announces: _Trav:l Biwrou--F:rst-Clas Twrz--Marz, Viin*s, and\nx: Trouj:n Planets. Spej:l reits tu aol s*nz wixin 60 lyt iirz!_ But\nthere is only a single picture of a dull-looking metal sphere, with\npassengers moving up a ramp, and the office is closed. You begin to get\nthe hang of the spelling they use, though.\n\nNow there are people around you, but nobody pays much attention to you.\nWhy should they? You wouldn't care if you saw a man in a leopard-skin\nsuit; you'd figure it was some part in a play and let it go. Well,\npeople don't change much.\n\nYou get up your courage and go up to a boy selling something that might\nbe papers on tapes.\n\n\"Where can I find the Museum of Science?\"\n\n\"Downayer rien turn lefa the sign. Stoo bloss,\" he tells you. Around\nyou, you hear some pretty normal English, but there are others using\nstuff as garbled as his. The educated and uneducated? I don't know.\n\nYou go right until you find a big sign built into the rubbery surface\nof the walk: _Miuzi:m *v Syens_. There's an arrow pointing and you turn\nleft. Ahead of you, two blocks on, you can see a pink building, with\nfaint aqua trimming, bigger than most of the others. They are building\nlower than they used to, apparently. Twenty floors up seems about the\nmaximum. You head for it, and find the sidewalk is marked with the\ninformation that it is the museum.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nYou go up the steps, but you see that it seems to be closed. You\nhesitate for a moment, then. You're beginning to think the whole affair\nis complete nonsense, and you should get back to the time machine and\ngo home. But then a guard comes to the gate. Except for the short legs\nin his suit and the friendly grin on his face, he looks like any other\nguard.\n\nWhat's more, he speaks pretty clearly. Everyone says things in a sort\nof drawl, with softer vowels and slurred consonants, but it's rather\npleasant.\n\n\"Help you, sir? Oh, of course. You must be playing in 'Atoms and\nAxioms.' The museum's closed, but I'll be glad to let you study\nwhatever you need for realism in your role. Nice show. I saw it twice.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" you mutter, wondering what kind of civilization can produce\nguards as polite as that. \"I--I'm told I should investigate your\ndisplay of atomic generators.\"\n\nHe beams at that. \"Of course.\" The gate is swung to behind you, but\nobviously he isn't locking it. In fact, there doesn't seem to be a\nlock. \"Must be a new part. You go down that corridor, up one flight\nof stairs and left. Finest display in all the known worlds. We've got\nthe original of the first thirteen models. Professor Jonas was using\nthem to check his latest theory of how they work. Too bad he could\nnot explain the principle, either. Someone will, some day, though.\nLord, the genius of that twentieth century inventor! It's quite a\nhobby with me, sir. I've read everything I could get on the period.\nOh--congratulations on your pronunciation. Sounds just like some of our\noldest tapes.\"\n\nYou get away from him, finally, after some polite thanks. The building\nseems deserted and you wander up the stairs. There's a room on your\nright filled with something that proclaims itself the first truly\nplastic diamond former, and you go up to it. As you come near, it\ngoes through a crazy wiggle inside, stops turning out a continual row\nof what seem to be bearings, and slips something the size of a penny\ntoward you.\n\n\"Souvenir,\" it announces in a well-modulated voice. \"This is a typical\ngem of the twentieth century, properly cut to 58 facets, known\ntechnically as a Jaegger diamond, and approximately twenty carats\nin size. You can have it made into a ring on the third floor during\nmorning hours for one-tenth credit. If you have more than one child,\npress the red button for the number of stones you desire.\"\n\nYou put it in your pocket, gulping a little, and get back to the\ncorridor. You turn left and go past a big room in which models of\nspaceships--from the original thing that looks like a V-2, and is\nlabeled first Lunar rocket, to a ten-foot globe, complete with\nminiature manikins--are sailing about in some kind of orbits. Then\nthere is one labeled _Wep:nz_, filled with everything from a crossbow\nto a tiny rod four inches long and half the thickness of a pencil,\nmarked _Fynal Hand Arm_. Beyond is the end of the corridor, and a big\nplace that bears a sign, _Mad:lz *v Atamic Pau:r Sorsez_.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBy that time, you're almost convinced. And you've been doing a lot of\nthinking about what you can do. The story I'm telling has been sinking\nin, but you aren't completely willing to accept it.\n\nYou notice that the models are all mounted on tables and that they're a\nlot smaller than you thought. They seem to be in chronological order,\nand the latest one, marked _2147--Rincs Dyn*pat:_, is about the size\nof a desk telephone. The earlier ones are larger, of course, clumsier,\nbut with variations, probably depending on the power output. A big sign\non the ceiling gives a lot of dope on atomic generators, explaining\nthat this is the first invention which leaped full blown into basically\nfinal form.\n\nYou study it, but it mentions casually the inventor, without giving\nhis name. Either they don't know it, or they take it for granted that\neveryone does, which seems more probable. They call attention to the\nfact that they have the original model of the first atomic generator\nbuilt, complete with design drawings, original manuscript on operation,\nand full patent application.\n\nThey state that it has all major refinements, operating on any fuel,\nproducing electricity at any desired voltage up to five million, any\nchosen cyclic rate from direct current to one thousand megacycles,\nand any amperage up to one thousand, its maximum power output being\nfifty kilowatts, limited by the current-carrying capacity of the\noutputs. They also mention that the operating principle is still being\ninvestigated, and that only such refinements as better alloys and the\naddition of magnetric and nucleatric current outlets have been added\nsince the original.\n\nSo you go to the end and look over the thing. It's simply a square box\nwith a huge plug on each side, and a set of vernier controls on top,\nplus a little hole marked, in old-style spelling, _Drop BBs or wire\nhere_. Apparently that's the way it's fueled. It's about one foot on\neach side.\n\n\"Nice,\" the guard says over your shoulder. \"It finally wore out one of\nthe cathogrids and we had to replace that, but otherwise it's exactly\nas the great inventor made it. And it still operates as well as ever.\nLike to have me tell you about it?\"\n\n\"Not particularly,\" you begin, and then realize bad manners might be\nconspicuous here. While you're searching for an answer, the guard pulls\nsomething out of his pocket and stares at it.\n\n\"Fine, fine. The mayor of Altasecarba--Centaurian, you know--is\narriving, but I'll be back in about ten minutes. He wants to examine\nsome of the weapons for a monograph on Centaurian primitives compared\nto nineteenth century man. You'll pardon me?\"\n\nYou pardon him pretty eagerly and he wanders off happily. You go up\nto the head of the line, to that Rinks Dynapattuh, or whatever it\ntransliterates to. That's small and you can carry it. But the darned\nthing is absolutely fixed. You can't see any bolts, but you can't budge\nit, either.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nYou work down the line. It'd be foolish to take the early model if you\ncan get one with built-in magnetic current terminals--Ehrenhaft or\nsome other principle?--and nuclear binding-force energy terminals. But\nthey're all held down by the same whatchamaycallem effect.\n\nAnd, finally, you're right back beside the original first model. It's\nprobably bolted down, too, but you try it tentatively and you find it\nmoves. There's a little sign under it, indicating you shouldn't touch\nit, since the gravostatic plate is being renewed.\n\nWell, you won't be able to change the time cycle by doing anything I\nhaven't told you, but a working model such as that is a handy thing.\nYou lift it; it only weighs about fifty pounds! Naturally, it can be\ncarried.\n\nYou expect a warning bell, but nothing happens. As a matter of fact,\nif you'd stop drinking so much of that scotch and staring at the time\nmachine out there now, you'd hear what I'm saying and know what will\nhappen to you. But of course, just as I did, you're going to miss a\nlot of what I say from now on, and have to find out for yourself. But\nmaybe some of it helps. I've tried to remember how much I remembered,\nafter he told me, but I can't be sure. So I'll keep on talking. I\nprobably can't help it, anyhow. Pre-set, you might say.\n\nWell, you stagger down the corridor, looking out for the guard, but all\nseems clear. Then you hear his voice from the weapons room. You bend\ndown and try to scurry past, but you know you're in full view. Nothing\nhappens, though.\n\nYou stumble down the stairs, feeling all the futuristic rays in the\nworld on your back, and still nothing happens. Ahead of you, the gate\nis closed. You reach it and it opens obligingly by itself. You breathe\na quick sigh of relief and start out onto the street.\n\nThen there's a yell behind you. You don't wait. You put one leg in\nfront of the other and you begin racing down the walk, ducking past\npeople, who stare at you with expressions you haven't time to see.\nThere's another yell behind you.\n\nSomething goes over your head and drops on the sidewalk just in front\nof your feet, with a sudden ringing sound. You don't wait to find out\nabout that, either. Somebody reaches out a hand to catch you and you\ndart past.\n\nThe street is pretty clear now and you jolt along, with your arms\nseeming to come out of the sockets, and that atomic generator getting\nheavier at every step.\n\nOut of nowhere, something in a blue uniform about six feet tall and\non the beefy side appears--and the badge hasn't changed much. The cop\ncatches your arm and you know you're not going to get away, so you stop.\n\n\"You can't exert yourself that hard in this heat, fellow,\" the cop\nsays. \"There are laws against that, without a yellow sticker. Here, let\nme grab you a taxi.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nReaction sets in a bit and your knees begin to buckle, but you shake\nyour head and come up for air.\n\n\"I--I left my money home,\" you begin.\n\nThe cop nods. \"Oh, that explains it. Fine, I won't have to give you\nan appearance schedule. But you should have come to me.\" He reaches\nout and taps a pedestrian lightly on the shoulder. \"Sir, an emergency\nrequest. Would you help this gentleman?\"\n\nThe pedestrian grins, looks at his watch, and nods. \"How far?\"\n\nYou did notice the name of the building from which you came and you\nmutter it. The stranger nods again, reaches out and picks up the other\nside of the generator, blowing a little whistle the cop hands him.\nPedestrians begin to move aside, and you and the stranger jog down the\nstreet at a trot, with a nice clear path, while the cop stands beaming\nat you both.\n\nThat way, it isn't so bad. And you begin to see why I decided I might\nlike to stay in the future. But all the same, the organized cooperation\nhere doesn't look too good. The guard can get the same and be there\nbefore you.\n\nAnd he is. He stands just inside the door of the building as you reach\nit. The stranger lifts an eyebrow and goes off at once when you nod\nat him, not waiting for thanks. And the guard comes up, holding some\ndinkus in his hand, about the size of a big folding camera and not too\ndissimilar in other ways. He snaps it open and you get set to duck.\n\n\"You forgot the prints, monograph, and patent applications,\" he says.\n\"They go with the generator--we don't like to have them separated. A\ngood thing I knew the production office of 'Atoms and Axioms' was in\nthis building. Just let us know when you're finished with the model and\nwe'll pick it up.\"\n\nYou swallow several sets of tonsils you had removed years before, and\ntake the bundle of papers he hands you out of the little case. He pumps\nyou for some more information, which you give him at random. It seems\nto satisfy your amiable guard friend. He finally smiles in satisfaction\nand heads back to the museum.\n\nYou still don't believe it, but you pick up the atomic generator and\nthe information sheets, and you head down toward the service elevator.\nThere is no button on it. In fact, there's no door there.\n\nYou start looking for other doors or corridors, but you know this is\nright. The signs along the halls are the same as they were.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen there's a sort of cough and something dilates in the wall. It\nforms a perfect door and the elevator stands there waiting. You get in,\ngulping out something about going all the way down, and then wonder how\na machine geared for voice operation can make anything of that. What\nthe deuce would that lowest basement be called? But the elevator has\nclosed and is moving downward in a hurry. It coughs again and you're at\nthe original level. You get out--and realize you don't have a light.\n\nYou'll never know what you stumbled over, but, somehow, you move back\nin the direction of the time machine, bumping against boxes, staggering\nhere and there, and trying to find the right place by sheer feel. Then\na shred of dim light appears; it's the weak light in the time machine.\n\nYou've located it.\n\nYou put the atomic generator in the luggage space, throw the papers\ndown beside it, and climb into the cockpit, sweating and mumbling. You\nreach forward toward the green button and hesitate. There's a red one\nbeside it and you finally decide on that.\n\nSuddenly, there's a confused yell from the direction of the elevator\nand a beam of light strikes against your eyes, with a shout punctuating\nit. Your finger touches the red button.\n\nYou'll never know what the shouting was about--whether they finally\ndoped out the fact that they'd been robbed, or whether they were trying\nto help you. You don't care which it is. The field springs up around\nyou and the next button you touch--the one on the board that hasn't\nbeen used so far--sends you off into nothingness. There is no beam of\nlight, you can't hear a thing, and you're safe.\n\nIt isn't much of a trip back. You sit there smoking and letting your\nnerves settle back to normal. You notice a third set of buttons, with\nsome pencil marks over them--\"Press these to return to yourself 30\nyears\"--and you begin waiting for the air to get stale. It doesn't\nbecause there is only one of you this time.\n\nInstead, everything flashes off and you're sitting in the machine in\nyour own back yard.\n\nYou'll figure out the cycle in more details later. You get into the\nmachine in front of your house, go to the future in the sub-basement,\nland in your back yard, and then hop back thirty years to pick up\nyourself, landing in front of your house. Just that. But right then,\nyou don't care. You jump out and start pulling out that atomic\ngenerator and taking it inside.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt isn't hard to disassemble, but you don't learn a thing; just some\nplates of metal, some spiral coils, and a few odds and ends--all\nthings that can be made easily enough, all obviously of common metals.\nBut when you put it together again, about an hour later, you notice\nsomething.\n\nEverything in it is brand-new and there's one set of copper wires\nmissing! It won't work. You put some #12 house wire in, exactly like\nthe set on the other side, drop in some iron filings, and try it again.\n\nAnd with the controls set at 120 volts, 60 cycles and 15 amperes, you\nget just that. You don't need the power company any more. And you\nfeel a little happier when you realize that the luggage space wasn't\ninsulated from time effects by a field, so the motor has moved backward\nin time, somehow, and is back to its original youth--minus the\nreplaced wires the guard mentioned--which probably wore out because of\nthe makeshift job you've just done.\n\nBut you begin getting more of a jolt when you find that the papers are\nall in your own writing, that your name is down as the inventor, and\nthat the date of the patent application is 1951.\n\nIt will begin to soak in, then. You pick up an atomic generator in the\nfuture and bring it back to the past--your present--so that it can be\nput in the museum with you as the inventor so you can steal it to be\nthe inventor. And you do it in a time machine which you bring back to\nyourself to take yourself into the future to return to take back to\nyourself....\n\nWho invented what? And who built which?\n\nBefore long, your riches from the generator are piling in. Little\nkids from school are coming around to stare at the man who changed\nhistory and made atomic power so common that no nation could hope to\nbe anything but a democracy and a peaceful one--after some of the\nworst times in history for a few years. Your name eventually becomes as\ncommon as Ampere, or Faraday, or any other spelled without a capital\nletter.\n\nBut you're thinking of the puzzle. You can't find any answer.\n\nOne day you come across an old poem--something about some folks\ncalling it evolution and others calling it God. You go out, make a few\nprovisions for the future, and come back to climb into the time machine\nthat's waiting in the building you had put around it. Then you'll be\nknocking on your own door, thirty years back--or right now, from your\nview--and telling your younger self all these things I'm telling you.\n\nBut now....\n\nWell, the drinks are finished. You're woozy enough to go along with me\nwithout protest, and I want to find out just why those people up there\ncame looking for you and shouting, before the time machine left.\n\nLet's go.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's ...And It Comes Out Here, by Lester del Rey\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ...AND IT COMES OUT HERE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51046.txt or 51046.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/0/4/51046/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
