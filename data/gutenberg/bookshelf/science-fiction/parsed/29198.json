P. Meek_\n\n\nMcQuarrie, the City Editor, looked up as I entered his office.\n\n\"Bond,\" he asked, \"do you know Jim Carpenter?\"\n\n[Sidenote: For eighty vertical miles Carpenter and\nBond blasted their way--only to be\ntrapped by the extraordinary monsters\nof the heaviside layer.]\n\n\"I know him slightly,\" I replied cautiously. \"I have met him several\ntimes and I interviewed him some years ago when he improved the Hadley\nrocket motor. I can't claim a very extensive acquaintance with him.\"\n\n\"I thought you knew him well. It is a surprise to me to find that there\nis any prominent man who is not an especial friend of yours. At any rate\nyou know him as well as anyone of the staff, so I'll give you the\nassignment.\"\n\n\"What's he up to now?\" I asked.\n\n\"He's going to try to punch a hole in the heaviside layer.\"\n\n\"But that's impossible,\" I cried. \"How can anyone....\"\n\nMy voice died away in silence. True enough, the idea of trying to make a\npermanent hole in a field of magnetic force was absurd, but even as I\nspoke I remembered that Jim Carpenter had never agreed to the opinion\nalmost unanimously held by our scientists as to the true nature of the\nheaviside layer.\n\n\"It may be impossible,\" replied McQuarrie dryly, \"but you are not hired\nby this paper as a scientific consultant. For some reason, God alone\nknows why, the owner thinks that you are a reporter. Get down there and\ntry to prove he is right by digging up a few facts about Carpenter's\nattempt. Wire your stuff in and Peavey will write it up. On this one\noccasion, please try to conceal your erudition and send in your story in\nsimple words of one syllable which uneducated men like Peavey and me can\ncomprehend. That's all.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe turned again to his desk and I left the room. At one time I would\nhave come from such an interview with my face burning, but McQuarrie's\nvitriol slid off me like water off a duck's back. He didn't really mean\nhalf of what he said, and he knew as well as I did that his crack about\nmy holding my job with the Clarion as a matter of pull was grossly\nunjust. It is true that I knew Trimble, the owner of the Clarion, fairly\nwell, but I got my job without any aid from him. McQuarrie himself hired\nme and I held my job because he hadn't fired me, despite the caustic\nremarks which he addressed to me. I had made the mistake when I first\ngot on the paper of letting McQuarrie know that I was a graduate\nelectrical engineer from Leland University, and he had held it against\nme from that day on. I don't know whether he really held it seriously\nagainst me or not, but what I have written above is a fair sample of his\nusual manner toward me.\n\nIn point of fact I had greatly minimized the extent of my acquaintance\nwith Jim Carpenter. I had been in Leland at the same time that he was\nand had known him quite well. When I graduated, which was two years\nafter he did, I worked for about a year in his laboratory, and my\nknowledge of the improvement which had made the Hadley rocket motor a\npracticability came from first hand knowledge and not from an interview.\nThat was several years before but I knew that he never forgot an\nacquaintance, let alone a friend, and while I had left him to take up\nother work our parting had been pleasant, and I looked forward with real\npleasure to seeing him again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJim Carpenter, the stormy petrel of modern science! The eternal\niconoclast: the perpetual opponent! He was probably as deeply versed in\nthe theory of electricity and physical chemistry as any man alive, but\nit pleased him to pose as a \"practical\" man who knew next to nothing of\ntheory and who despised the little he did know. His great delight was to\nexperimentally smash the most beautifully constructed theories which\nwere advanced and taught in the colleges and universities of the world,\nand when he couldn't smash them by experimental evidence, to attack them\nfrom the standpoint of philosophical reasoning and to twist around the\ndata on which they were built and make it prove, or seem to prove, the\nexact opposite of what was generally accepted.\n\nNo one questioned his ability. When the ill-fated Hadley had first\nconstructed the rocket motor which bears his name it was Jim Carpenter\nwho made it practical. Hadley had tried to disintegrate lead in order to\nget his back thrust from the atomic energy which it contained and proved\nby apparently unimpeachable mathematics that lead was the only substance\nwhich could be used. Jim Carpenter had snorted through the pages of the\nelectrical journals and had turned out a modification of Hadley's\ninvention which disintegrated aluminum. The main difference in\nperformance was that, while Hadley's original motor would not develop\nenough power to lift itself from the ground, Carpenter's modification\nproduced twenty times the horsepower per pound of weight of any\npreviously known generator of power and changed the rocket ship from a\nwild dream to an everyday commonplace.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Hadley later constructed his space flyer and proposed to visit the\nmoon, it was Jim Carpenter who ridiculed the idea of the attempt being\nsuccessful. He proposed the novel and weird idea that the path to space\nwas not open, but that the earth and the atmosphere were enclosed in a\nhollow sphere of impenetrable substance through which Hadley's space\nflyer could not pass. How accurate were his prognostications was soon\nknown to everyone. Hadley built and equipped his flyer and started off\non what he hoped would be an epoch making flight. It was one, but not in\nthe way which he had hoped. His ship took off readily enough, being\npowered with four rocket motors working on Carpenter's principle, and\nrose to a height of about fifty miles, gaining velocity rapidly. At that\npoint his velocity suddenly began to drop.\n\nHe was in constant radio communication with the earth and he reported\nhis difficulty. Carpenter advised him to turn back while he could, but\nHadley kept on. Slower and slower became his progress, and after he had\npenetrated ten miles into the substance which hindered him, his ship\nstuck fast. Instead of using his bow motors and trying to back out, he\nhad moved them to the rear, and with the combined force of his four\nmotors he had penetrated for another two miles. There he insanely tried\nto force his motors to drive him on until his fuel was exhausted.\n\nHe had lived for over a year in his space flyer, but all of his efforts\ndid not serve to materially change his position. He had tried, of\ncourse, to go out through his air locks and explore space, but his\nstrength, even although aided by powerful levers, could not open the\nouter doors of the locks against the force which was holding them shut.\nCareful observations were continuously made of the position of his\nflyer and it was found that it was gradually returning toward the earth.\nIts motion was very slight, not enough to give any hope for the\noccupant. Starting from a motion so slow that it could hardly be\ndetected, the velocity of return gradually accelerated; and three years\nafter Hadley's death, the flyer was suddenly released from the force\nwhich held it, and it plunged to the earth, to be reduced by the force\nof its fall to a twisted, pitiful mass of unrecognizable junk.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe remains were examined, and the iron steel parts were found to be\nhighly magnetized. This fact was seized upon by the scientists of the\nworld and a theory was built up of a magnetic field of force surrounding\nthe earth through which nothing of a magnetic nature could pass. This\ntheory received almost universal acceptance, Jim Carpenter alone of the\nmore prominent men of learning refusing to admit the validity of it. He\ngravely stated it as his belief that no magnetic field existed, but that\nthe heaviside layer was composed of some liquid of high viscosity whose\ndensity and consequent resistance to the passage of a body through it\nincreased in the ratio of the square of the distance to which one\npenetrated into it.\n\nThere was a moment of stunned surprise when he announced his radical\nidea, and then a burst of Jovian laughter shook the scientific press.\nCarpenter was in his glory. For months he waged a bitter controversy in\nthe scientific journals and when he failed to win converts by this\nmethod, he announced that he would prove it by blasting a way into space\nthrough the heaviside layer, a thing which would be patently impossible\nwere it a field of force. He had lapsed into silence for two years and\nhis curt note to the Associated Press to the effect that he was now\nready to demonstrate his experiment was the first intimation the world\nhad received of his progress.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI drew expense money from the cashier and boarded the Lark for Los\nAngeles. When I arrived I went to a hotel and at once called Carpenter\non the telephone.\n\n\"Jim Carpenter speaking,\" came his voice presently.\n\n\"Good evening, Mr. Carpenter,\" I replied, \"this is Bond of the San\nFrancisco Clarion.\"\n\nI would be ashamed to repeat the language which came over that\ntelephone. I was informed that all reporters were pests and that I was a\ndoubly obnoxious specimen and that were I within reach I would be\npromptly assaulted and that reporters would be received at nine the next\nmorning and no earlier or later.\n\n\"Just a minute, Mr. Carpenter,\" I cried as he neared the end of his\nperoration and was, I fancied, about to slam up the receiver. \"Don't you\nremember me? I was at Leland with you and used to work in your\nlaboratory in the atomic disintegration section.\"\n\n\"What's your name?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Bond, Mr. Carpenter.\"\n\n\"Oh, First Mortgage! Certainly I remember you. Mighty glad to hear your\nvoice. How are you?\"\n\n\"Fine, thank you, Mr. Carpenter. I would not have ventured to call you\nhad I not known you. I didn't mean to impose and I'll be glad to see you\nin the morning at nine.\"\n\n\"Not by a long shot,\" he cried. \"You'll come up right away. Where are\nyou staying?\"\n\n\"At the El Rey.\"\n\n\"Well, check out and come right up here. There's lots of room for you\nhere at the plant and I'll be glad to have you. I want at least one\nintelligent report of this experiment and you should be able to write\nit. I'll look for you in an hour.\"\n\n\"I don't want to impose--\" I began; but he interrupted.\n\n\"Nonsense, glad to have you. I needed someone like you badly and you\nhave come just in the nick of time. I'll expect you in an hour.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe receiver clicked and I hastened to follow his instructions. A\nringside seat was just what I was looking for. It took my taxi a little\nover an hour to get to the Carpenter laboratory and I chuckled when I\nthought of how McQuarrie's face would look when he saw my expense\naccount. Presently we reached the edge of the grounds which surrounded\nthe Carpenter laboratory and were stopped at the high gate I remembered\nso well.\n\n\"Are you sure you'll get in, buddy?\" asked my driver.\n\n\"Certainly,\" I replied. \"What made you ask?\"\n\n\"I've brought three chaps out here to-day and none of them got in,\" he\nanswered with a grin. \"I'm glad you're so sure, but I'll just wait\naround until you are inside before I drive away.\"\n\nI laughed and advanced to the gate. Tim, the old guard, was still there,\nand he remembered and welcomed me.\n\n\"Me ordhers wuz t' let yez roight in, sor,\" he said as he greeted me.\n\"Jist lave ye'er bag here and Oi'll have ut sint roight up.\"\n\nI dropped my bag and trudged up the well remembered path to the\nlaboratory. It had been enlarged somewhat since I saw it last and, late\nthough the hour was, there was a bustle in the air and I could see a\nnumber of men working in the building. From an area in the rear, which\nwas lighted by huge flood lights, came the staccato tattoo of a riveter.\nI walked up to the front of the laboratory and entered. I knew the way\nto Carpenter's office and I went directly there and knocked.\n\n\"Hello, First Mortgage!\" cried Jim Carpenter as I entered in response to\nhis call. \"I'm glad to see you. Excuse the bruskness of my first\ngreeting to you over the telephone, but the press have been deviling me\nall day, every man jack of them trying to steal a march on the rest. I\nam going to open the whole shebang at nine to-morrow and give them all\nan equal chance to look things over before I turn the current on at\nnoon. As soon as we have a little chat, I'll show you over the works.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter half an hour's chat he rose. \"Come along, First Mortgage,\" he\nsaid, \"we'll go out and look the place over and I'll explain everything.\nIf my ideas work out, you'll have no chance to go over it to-morrow, so\nI want you to see it now.\"\n\nI had no chance to ask him what he meant by this remark, for he walked\nrapidly from the laboratory and I perforce followed him. He led the way\nto the patch of lighted ground behind the building where the riveting\nmachine was still beating out its monotonous cacaphony and paused by the\nfirst of a series of huge reflectors, which were arranged in a circle.\n\n\"Here is the start of the thing,\" he said. \"There are two hundred and\nfifty of these reflectors arranged in a circle four hundred yards in\ndiameter. Each of them is an opened parabola of such spread that their\nbeams will cover an area ten yards in diameter at fifty miles above the\nearth. If my calculations are correct they should penetrate through the\nlayer at an average speed of fifteen miles per hour per unit, and by two\no'clock to-morrow afternoon, the road to space should be open.\"\n\n\"What is your power?\" I asked.\n\n\"Nothing but a concentration of infra-red rays. The heaviside layer, as\nyou doubtless know, is a liquid and, I think, an organic liquid. If I am\nright in that thought, the infra-red will cut through it like a knife\nthrough cheese.\"\n\n\"If it is a liquid, how will you prevent it from flowing back into the\nhole you have opened?\" I asked.\n\n\"When the current is first turned on, each reflector will bear on the\nsame point. Notice that they are moveable. They are arranged so that\nthey move together. As soon as the first hole is bored through, they\nwill move by clockwork, extending the opening until each points\nvertically upward and the hole is four hundred yards in diameter. I am\npositive that there will be no rapid flow even after the current is\nturned off, for I believe that the liquid is about as mobile as\npetroleum jelley. Should it close, however, it would take only a couple\nof hours to open it again to allow the space flyer to return.\"\n\n\"What space flyer?\" I demanded quickly.\n\n\"The one we are going to be on, First Mortgage,\" he replied with a\nslight chuckle.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"We?\" I cried, aghast.\n\n\"Certainly. We. You and I. You didn't think I was going to send you\nalone, did you?\"\n\n\"I didn't know that anyone was going.\"\n\n\"Of course. Someone has to go; otherwise, how could I prove my point? I\nmight cut through a hundred holes and yet these stiff-necked old\nfossils, seeing nothing, would not believe. No, First Mortgage, when\nthose arcs start working to-morrow, you and I will be in a Hadley space\nship up at the bottom of the layer, and as soon as the road has been\nopened, two of the lamps will cut off to allow us through. Then the\nbattery will hold the road open while we pass out into space and\nreturn.\"\n\n\"Suppose we meet with Hadley's fate?\" I demanded.\n\n\"We won't. Even if I am wrong--which is very unlikely--we won't meet\nwith any such fate. We have two stern motors and four bow motors. As\nsoon as we meet with the slightest resistance to our forward progress we\nwill stop and have twice the power plus gravity to send us earthwards.\nThere is no danger connected with the trip.\"\n\n\"All the same--\" I began.\n\n\"All the same, you're going,\" he replied. \"Man alive, think of the\nchance to make a world scoop for your paper! No other press man has the\nslightest inkling of my plan and even if they had, there isn't another\nspace flyer in the world that I know of. If you don't want to go, I'll\ngive some one else the chance, but I prefer you, for you know something\nof my work.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI thought rapidly for a moment. The chance was a unique one and one that\nhalf the press men in San Francisco would have given their shirts to\nget. I had had my doubts of the accuracy of Jim Carpenter's reasoning\nwhile I was away from him, but there was no resisting the dynamic\npersonality of the man when in his presence.\n\n\"You win,\" I said with a laugh. \"Your threat of offering some of my\nhated rivals a chance settled it.\"\n\n\"Good boy!\" he exclaimed, pounding me on the back. \"I knew you'd come. I\nhad intended to take one of my assistants with me, but as soon as I knew\nyou were here I decided that you were the man. There really ought to be\na press representative along. Come with me and I'll show you our flyer.\"\n\nThe flyer proved to be of the same general type as had been used by\nHadley. It was equipped with six rocket motors, four discharging to the\nbow and two to the stern. Any one of them, Carpenter said, was ample for\nmotive power. Equilibrium was maintained by means of a heavy gyroscope\nwhich would prevent any turning of the axis of its rotation. The entire\nflyer shell could be revolved about the axis so that oblique motion with\nour bow and stern motors was readily possible. Direct lateral movement\nwas provided for by valves which would divert a portion of the discharge\nof either a bow or stern motor out through side vents in any direction.\nThe motive power, of course, was furnished by the atomic disintegration\nof powdered aluminum. The whole interior, except for the portion of the\nwalls, roof and floor, which was taken up by vitriolene windows, was\nheavily padded.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt nine the next morning the gates to the enclosure were thrown open and\nthe representatives of the press admitted. Jim Carpenter mounted a\nplatform and explained briefly what he proposed to do and then broke the\ncrowd up into small groups and sent them over the works with guides.\nWhen all had been taken around they were reassembled and Carpenter\nannounced to them his intention of going up in a space flyer and prove,\nby going through the heaviside layer, that he had actually destroyed a\nportion of it. There was an immediate clamor of applications to go with\nhim. He laughingly announced that one reporter was all that he could\nstand on the ship and that he was taking one of his former associates\nwith him. I could tell by the envious looks with which I was favored\nthat any popularity I had ever had among my associates was gone forever.\nThere was little time to think of such things, however, for the hour for\nour departure was approaching, and the photographers were clamoring for\npictures of us and the flyer.\n\nWe satisfied them at last, and I entered the flyer after Carpenter. We\nsealed the car up, started the air conditioner, and were ready for\ndeparture.\n\n\"Scared, Pete?\" asked Carpenter, his hand on the starting lever.\n\nI gulped a little as I looked at him. He was perfectly calm to a casual\ninspection, but I knew him well enough to interpret the small spots of\nred which appeared on his high cheekbones and the glitter in his eye. He\nmay not have been as frightened as I was but he was laboring under an\nenormous nervous strain. The mere fact that he called me \"Pete\" instead\nof his usual \"First Mortgage\" showed that he was feeling pretty serious.\n\n\"Not exactly scared,\" I replied, \"but rather uneasy, so to speak.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe laughed nervously.\n\n\"Cheer up, old man! If anything goes wrong, we won't know it. Sit down\nand get comfortable; this thing will start with a jerk.\"\n\nHe pulled the starting lever forward suddenly and I felt as though an\nintolerable weight were pressed against me, glueing me to my seat. The\nfeeling lasted only for a moment, for he quickly eased up on the motor,\nand in a few moments I felt quite normal.\n\n\"How fast are we going?\" I asked.\n\n\"Only two hundred miles an hour,\" he replied. \"We will reach the layer\nin plenty of time at this rate and I don't want to jam into it. You can\nget up now.\"\n\nI rose, moved over to the observation glass in the floor, and looked\ndown. We were already five or ten miles above the earth and were\nascending rapidly. I could still detect the great circle of reflectors\nwith which our way was to be opened.\n\n\"How can you tell where these heat beams are when they are turned on?\" I\nasked. \"Infra-red rays are not visible, and we will soon be out of sight\nof the reflectors.\"\n\n\"I forgot to mention that I am having a small portion of visible red\nrays mixed with the infra-red so that we can spot them. I have a radio\ntelephone here, working on my private wavelength, so that I can direct\noperations from here as well as from the ground--in fact, better. If\nyou're cold, turn on the heater.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe friction of the flyer against the air had so far made up for the\ndecreasing temperature of the air surrounding us, but a glance at the\noutside thermometer warned me that his suggestion was a wise one. I\nturned a valve which diverted a small portion of our exhaust through a\nheating coil in the flyer. It was hard to realize that I was actually in\na rocket space ship, the second one to be flown and that, with the\nexception of the ill-fated Hadley, farther from the earth than any man\nhad been before. There was no sensation of movement in that hermetically\nsealed flyer, and, after the first few moments, the steady drone of the\nrocket motor failed to register on my senses. I was surprised to see\nthat there was no trail of detritus behind us.\n\n\"You can see our trail at night,\" replied Carpenter when I asked him\nabout it, \"but in daylight, there is nothing to see. The slight\nluminosity of the gasses is hidden by the sun's rays. We may be able to\nsee it when we get out in space beyond the layer, but I don't know. We\nhave arrived at the bottom of the layer now, I believe. At any rate, we\nare losing velocity.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI moved over to the instrument board and looked. Our speed had dropped\nto one hundred and ten miles an hour and was steadily falling off.\nCarpenter pulled the control lever and reduced our power. Gradually the\nflyer came to a stop and hung poised in space. He shut off the power an\ninstant and at once our indicator showed that we were falling, although\nvery slowly. He promptly reapplied the power, and by careful adjustment\nbrought us again to a dead stop.\n\n\"Ready to go,\" he remarked looking at his watch, \"and just on time, too.\nTake a glass and watch the ground. I am going to have the heat turned\non.\"\n\nI took the binoculars he indicated and turned them toward the ground\nwhile he gave a few crisp orders into his telephone. Presently from the\nground beneath us burst out a circle of red dots from which long beams\nstabbed up into the heavens. The beams converged as they mounted until\nat a point slightly below us, and a half-mile away they became one solid\nbeam of red. One peculiarity I noticed was that, while they were plainly\nvisible near the ground, they faded out, and it was not until they were\na few miles below us that they again became apparent. I followed their\npath upward into the heavens.\n\n\"Look here, Jim!\" I cried as I did so. \"Something's happening!\"\n\nHe sprang to my side and glanced at the beam.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" he shouted, pounding me on the back. \"I was right! Look! And\nthe fools called it a magnetic field!\"\n\nUpward the beam was boring its way, but it was almost concealed by a\nrain of fine particles of black which were falling around it.\n\n\"It's even more spectacular than I had hoped,\" he chortled. \"I had\nexpected to reduce the layer to such fluidity that we could penetrate\nit or even to vaporize it, but we are actually destroying it! That stuff\nis soot and is proof, if proof be needed, that the layer is an organic\nliquid.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe turned to his telephone and communicated the momentous news to the\nearth and then rejoined me at the window. For ten minutes we watched and\na slight diminution of the black cloud became apparent.\n\n\"They're through the layer,\" exclaimed Carpenter. \"Now watch, and you'll\nsee something. I'm going to start spreading the beam.\"\n\nHe turned again to his telephone, and presently the beam began to widen\nand spread out. As it did so the dark cloud became more dense than it\nhad been before. The earth below us was hidden and we could see the red\nonly as a dim murky glow through the falling soot. Carpenter inquired of\nthe laboratory and found that we were completely invisible to the\nground, half the heavens being hidden by the black pall. For an hour the\nbeam worked its way toward us.\n\n\"The hole is about four hundred yards in diameter right now,\" said\nCarpenter as he turned from the telephone. \"I have told them to stop the\nmovement of the reflectors, and as soon as the air clears a little,\nwe'll start through.\"\n\nIt took another hour for the soot to clear enough that we could plainly\ndetect the ring of red light before us. Carpenter gave some orders to\nthe ground, and a gap thirty yards wide opened in the wall before us.\nToward this gap the flyer moved slowly under the side thrust of the\ndiverted motor discharge. The temperature rose rapidly as we neared the\nwall of red light before us. Nearer we drew until the light was on both\nsides of us. Another few feet and the flyer shot forward with a jerk\nthat threw me sprawling on the floor. Carpenter fell too, but he\nmaintained his hold on the controls and tore at them desperately to\ncheck us.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI scrambled to my feet and watched. The red wall was alarmingly close.\nNearer we drove and then came another jerk which threw me sprawling\nagain. The wall retreated. In another moment we were standing still,\nwith the red all around us at a distance of about two hundred yards.\n\n\"We had a narrow escape from being cremated,\" said Carpenter with a\nshaky laugh. \"I knew that our speed would increase as soon as we got\nclear of the layer but it caught me by surprise just the same. I had no\nidea how great the holding effect of the stuff was. Well, First\nMortgage, the road to space is open for us. May I invite you to be my\nguest on a little week-end jaunt to the Moon?\"\n\n\"No thanks, Jim,\" I said with a wry smile. \"I think a little trip to the\nedge of the layer will quite satisfy me.\"\n\n\"Quitter,\" he laughed. \"Well, say good-by to familiar things. Here we\ngo!\"\n\nHe turned to the controls of the flyer, and presently we were moving\nagain, this time directly away from the earth. There was no jerk at\nstarting this time, merely a feeling as though the floor were pressing\nagainst my feet, a great deal like the feeling a person gets when they\nrise rapidly in an express elevator. The indicator showed that we were\ntraveling only sixty miles an hour. For half an hour we continued\nmonotonously on our way with nothing to divert us. Carpenter yawned.\n\n\"Now that it's all over, I feel let down and sleepy,\" he announced. \"We\nare well beyond the point to which Hadley penetrated and so far we have\nmet with no resistance. We are probably nearly at the outer edge of the\nlayer. I think I'll shoot up a few miles more and then call it a day and\ngo home. We are about eighty miles from the earth now.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI looked down, but could see nothing below us but the dense cloud of\nblack soot resulting from the destruction of the heaviside layer. Like\nCarpenter, I felt sleepy, and I suppressed a yawn as I turned again to\nthe window.\n\n\"Look here, Jim!\" I cried suddenly. \"What's that?\"\n\nHe moved in a leisurely manner to my side and looked out. As he did so I\nfelt his hand tighten on my shoulder with a desperate grip. Down the\nwall of red which surrounded us was coming an object of some kind. The\nthing was fully seventy-five yards long and half as wide at its main\nportion, while long irregular streams extended for a hundred yards on\neach side of it. There seemed to be dozens of them.\n\n\"What is it, Jim?\" I asked in a voice which sounded high and unnatural\nto me.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he muttered, half to me and half to himself. \"Good Lord,\nthere's another of them!\"\n\nHe pointed. Not far from the first of the things came another, even\nlarger than the first. They were moving sluggishly along the red light,\nseeming to flow rather than to crawl. I had a horrible feeling that they\nwere alive and malignant. Carpenter stepped back to the controls of the\nflyer and stopped our movement; we hung in space, watching them. The\nthings were almost level with us, but their sluggish movement was\ndownward toward the earth. In color, they were a brilliant crimson,\ndeepening into purple near the center. Just as the first of them came\nopposite us it paused, and slowly a portion of the mass extended itself\nfrom the main bulk; and then, like doors opening, four huge eyes, each\nof them twenty feet in diameter, opened and stared at us.\n\n\"It's alive, Jim,\" I quavered. I hardly knew my own voice as I spoke.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJim stepped back to the controls with a white face, and slowly we moved\ncloser to the mass. As we approached I thought that I could detect a\nfleeting passage of expression in those huge eyes. Then they disappeared\nand only a huge crimson and purple blob lay before us. Jim moved the\ncontrols again and the flyer came to a stop.\n\nTwo long streamers moved out from the mass. Suddenly there was a jerk to\nthe ship which threw us both to the floor. It started upward at express\ntrain speed. Jim staggered to his feet, grasped the controls and started\nall four bow motors at full capacity, but even this enormous force had\nnot the slightest effect in diminishing our speed.\n\n\"Well, the thing's got us, whatever it is,\" said Jim as he pulled his\ncontrols to neutral, shutting off all power. Now that the danger had\nassumed a tangible form, he appeared as cool and collected as ever, to\nmy surprise, I found that I had recovered control of my muscle and of my\nvoice. I became aware that the shoulder which Jim had gripped was aching\nbadly, and I rubbed it absently.\n\n\"What is it, Jim?\" I asked for the third time.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he replied. \"It is some horrible inhabitant of space,\nsomething unknown to us on earth. From its appearance and actions, I\nthink it must be a huge single-celled animal of the type of the earthly\namoeba. If an amoeba is that large here, what must an elephant look\nlike? However, I expect that we'll learn more about the matter later\nbecause it's taking us with it, wherever it's going.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuddenly the flyer became dark inside. I looked at the nearest window,\nbut I could not even detect its outline. I reached for the light switch,\nbut a sudden change in direction threw me against the wall. There was an\ninstant of intense heat in the flyer.\n\n\"We have passed the heaviside layer,\" said Jim. \"The brute has changed\ndirection, and we felt that heat when he took us through the infra-red\nwall.\"\n\nI reached again for the light switch, but before I could find it our\nmotion ceased and an instant later the flyer was filled with glaring\nsunlight. We both turned to the window.\n\nWe lay on a glistening plain of bluish hue which stretched without a\nbreak as far as we could see. Not a thing broke the monotony of our\nvision. We turned to the opposite window. How can I describe the sight\nwhich met our horrified gaze? On the plain before us lay a huge purple\nmonstrosity of gargantuan dimensions. The thing was a shapeless mass,\nonly the four huge eyes standing out regarding us balefully. The mass\nwas continually changing its outline and, as we watched, a long streamer\nextended itself from the body toward us. Over and around the flyer the\nfeeler went, while green and red colors played over first one and then\nanother of the huge eyes before us. The feeler wrapped itself around the\nflyer and we were lifted into the air toward those horrible eyes. We had\nalmost reached them when the thing dropped us. We fell to the plain with\na crash. We staggered to our feet again and looked out. Our captor was\nbattling for its life.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIts attacker was a smaller thing of a brilliant green hue, striped and\nmottled with blue and yellow. While our captor was almost formless, the\nnewcomer had a very definite shape. It resembled a cross between a bird\nand a lizard, its shape resembling a bird, as did tiny rudimentary wings\nand a long beak, while the scaly covering and the fact that it had four\nlegs instead of two bore out the idea that it might be a lizard. Its\nhuge birdlike beak was armed with three rows of long sharp teeth with\nwhich it was tearing at our captor. The purple amoeba was holding its\nassailant with a dozen of its thrown out feelers which were wrapped\nabout the body and legs of the green horror. The whole battle was\nconducted in absolute silence.\n\n\"Now's our chance, Jim!\" I cried. \"Get away from here while that dragon\nhas the amoeba busy!\"\n\nHe jumped to the control levers of the flyer and pulled the starting\nswitch well forward. The shock of the sudden start hurled me to the\nfloor, but from where I fell I was able to watch the battle on the\nplain below us. It raged with uninterrupted fury and I felt certain of\nour escape when, with a shock which hurled both Jim and me to the\nceiling, the flyer stopped. We fell back to the floor and I reflected\nthat it was well for us that the interior of the flyer was so well\npadded. Had it not been, our bones would have been broken a dozen times\nby the shocks to which we had been subjected.\n\n\"What now?\" I asked as I painfully struggled to my feet.\n\n\"Another of those purple amoebas,\" replied Jim from the vantage point of\na window. \"He's looking us over as if he were trying to decide whether\nwe are edible or not.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI joined him at the window. The thing which had us was a replica of the\nmonster we had left below us engaged in battle with the green dragon\nwhich had attacked it. The same indefinite and ever changing outline was\nevident, as well as the four huge eyes. The thing regarded us for a\nmoment and slowly moved us up against its bulk until we touched it.\nDeeper and deeper into the mass of the body we penetrated until we were\nin a deep cavern with the light coming to us only from the entrance. I\nwatched the entrance and horror possessed my soul.\n\n\"The hole's closing. Jim!\" I gasped. \"The thing is swallowing us!\"\n\n\"I expected that,\" he replied grimly. \"The amoeba has no mouth, you\nknow. Nourishment is passed into the body through the skin, which closes\nbehind it. We are a modern version of Jonah and the whale, First\nMortgage.\"\n\n\"Well, Jonah got out,\" I ventured.\n\n\"We'll try to,\" he replied. \"When that critter swallowed us, he got\nsomething that will prove pretty indigestible. Let's try to give him a\nstomach ache. I don't suppose that a machine-gun will affect him, but\nwe'll try it.\"\n\n\"I didn't know that you had any guns on board.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I've got two machine-guns. We'll turn one of them loose, but I\ndon't expect much effect from it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe moved over to one of the guns and threw off the cover which had\nhidden it from my gaze. He fed in a belt of ammunition and pulled his\ntrigger. For half a minute he held it down, and two hundred and fifty\ncaliber thirty bullets tore their way into space. There was no evidence\nof movement on the part of our host.\n\n\"Just as I thought,\" remarked Jim as he threw aside the empty belt and\ncovered the gun again. \"The thing has no nervous organization to speak\nof and probably never felt that. We'll have to rig up a disintegrating\nray for him.\"\n\n\"What?\" I gasped.\n\n\"A disintegrating ray,\" he replied. \"Oh yes, I know how to make the\nfabulous 'death ray' that you journalists are always raving about. I\nhave never announced my discovery, for war is horrible enough without\nit, but I have generated it and used it in my work a number of times.\nDid it never occur to you that the rocket motor is built on a\ndisintegrating ray principle?\"\n\n\"Of course it is, Jim. I never thought of it in that light before, but\nit must be. How can you use it? The discharge from the motors is a\nharmless stream of energy particles.\"\n\n\"Instead of turning the ray into powdered aluminum and breaking it down,\nwhat is to prevent me from turning it against the body of our captor and\nblasting my way out?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Well, nothing is. I'll have to modify one of the motors a little, but\nit's not a hard job. Get some wrenches from the tool box and we'll\nstart.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAn hour of hard work enabled us to disconnect one of the reserve bow\nmotors and, after the modifications Jim had mentioned, turn the ray out\nthrough the port through which the products of disintegration were meant\nto go. When we had bolted it in place with an improvised coupling, Jim\nopened the vitriolene screen which held in our air and turned to his\ncontrol board.\n\n\"Here goes,\" he said.\n\nHe pulled the lever to full power and with a roar which almost deafened\nus in the small flyer, the ray leaped out to do its deadly work. I\nwatched through a port beside the motor. There was a flash of intense\nlight for an instant and then the motor died away in silence. A path to\nfreedom lay open before us. Jim started one of the stern motors and\nslowly we forced our way through the hole torn in the living mass. When\nwe were almost at the surface, he threw in full power and we shot free\nfrom the amoeba and into the open. Again we were stopped in midair and\ndrawn back toward the huge bulk. The eyes looked at us and we were\nturned around. As the ray swung into a position to point directly toward\none of the eyes, Jim pulled the controlling lever. With the flash of\nlight which ensued, the eye and a portion of the surrounding tissue\ndisappeared. The amoeba writhed and changed shape rapidly, while flashes\nof brilliant crimson played over the remaining eyes. Again the ray was\nbrought into play and another of the eyes disappeared. This was\nevidently enough for our captor, for it suddenly released us and\ninstantly we started to fall. Jim caught the control levers and turned\non our power in time to halt us only a few feet above the plain toward\nwhich we were falling. We were close to the point whence we had started\nup and we could see that the battle below us was still raging.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe green dragon was partially engulfed by the amoeba, but it still\nrelentlessly tore off huge chunks and devoured them. The amoeba was\ngreatly reduced in bulk but it still fought gamely. Even as we\napproached the dragon was evidently satiated, for it slowly withdrew\nfrom the purple bulk and back away. Long feelers shot out from the\namoeba's bulk toward the dragon but they were bitten off before they\ncould grasp their prey.\n\n\"Let's get away from here, Jim,\" I cried, but I spoke too late. Even as\nthe words left my mouth the green dragon saw us and raised itself in the\nair, and with gaping jaws launched itself at us. It took Jim only a\nmoment to shoot the flyer up into space, and the charge passed\nharmlessly beneath us. The dragon checked its headway and turned again\ntoward us.\n\n\"Use the machine-gun, Pete!\" cried Jim. \"I've got to run the ship.\"\n\nI threw the cover off the gun and fed in a fresh belt of ammunition. As\nthe green monster dashed toward us I hastily aligned the gun and pulled\nthe trigger. My aim was good and at least fifty of the bullets plowed\nthrough the approaching bulk before Jim dropped the ship and allowed it\nto pass above us. Again the dragon turned and charged, and again I met\nit with a hail of bullets. They had no apparent effect and Jim dropped\nthe ship again and let the huge bulk shoot by above us. Twice more the\ndragon rushed but the last rush was less violent than had been the first\nthree.\n\n\"The bullets are affecting him, Pete!\" cried Jim as he shot the flyer\nupward. \"Give him another dose!\"\n\nI hastily fed in another belt, but it was not needed. The dragon rushed\nthe fifth time, but before it reached us its velocity fell off and it\npassed harmlessly below us and fell on a long curve to the plain below.\nIt fell near the purple amoeba which it had battled and a long feeler\nshot out and grasped it. Straight into the purple mass it was drawn, and\nvanished into the huge bulk.\n\nJim started one of the stern motors. In a few seconds we were far from\nthe scene.\n\n\"Have you any idea of which direction to go?\" he asked. I shook my head.\n\n\"Have you a radio beacon?\" I asked.\n\nHe withered me with a glance.\n\n\"We're beyond the heaviside layer,\" he reminded me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a moment I was stunned.\n\n\"We can't be very far from the hole,\" he said consolingly as he fumbled\nwith the controls. \"But before we try to find it, we had better\ndisconnect one of the stern motors and rig it as a disintegrating ray so\nthat we will have one bearing in each direction. We may meet more\ndenizens of space who like our looks, and we haven't much ammunition\nleft.\"\n\nWe landed on the plain and in an hour had a second disintegrating ray\nready for action. Thus armed, we rose from the blue plain and started at\nrandom on our way. For ten minutes we went forward. Then Jim stopped the\nflyer and turned back. We had gone only a short distance when I called\nto him to stop.\n\n\"What is it?\" he demanded as he brought the flyer to a standstill.\n\n\"There's another creature ahead of us,\" I replied. \"A red one.\"\n\n\"Red?\" he asked excitedly as he joined me. About a mile ahead of us a\nhuge mass hung in the air. It resembled the amoeba which had attacked\nus, except that the newcomer was red. As we watched, it moved toward us.\nAs it did so its color changed to purple.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" cried Jim. \"Don't you remember, Pete, that the one which\ncaptured us and took us out of the hole was red while in the hole and\nthen turned purple? That thing just came out of the hole!\"\n\n\"Then why can't we see the red beam?\" I demanded.\n\n\"Because there's no air or anything to reflect it,\" he replied. \"We\ncan't see it until we are right in it.\"\n\nI devoutly hoped that he was right as he headed the ship toward the\nwaiting monster. As we approached the amoeba came rapidly to meet us and\na long feeler shot out. As it did so there was a flash of intense light\nahead of us as Jim turned loose the ray, and the feeler disappeared.\nAnother and another met the same fate. Then Jim rotated the ship\nslightly and let out the full force of the ray toward the monster. A\nhuge hole was torn in it, and as we approached with our ray blazing, the\namoeba slowly retreated and our path was open before us. Again there was\nan instant of intense heat as we passed through the red wall, and we\nwere again in the hole which Jim's lamps had blasted through the layer.\nBelow us still lay the fog which had obscured the earth when we had\nstarted on our upward trip.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDown toward the distant earth we dropped. We had gone about thirty miles\nbefore we saw on the side of the hole one of the huge amoeba which were\nso thick above.\n\n\"We might stop and pick that fellow off,\" said Jim, \"but, on the whole,\nI think we'll experiment with him.\"\n\nHe drove the ship nearer and turned it on its axis, holding it in\nposition by one of the auxiliary discharges. A flash came from our\nforward ray and a portion of the amoeba disappeared. A long arm moved\nout toward us, but it moved slowly and sluggishly instead of with the\nlightninglike swiftness which had characterized the movements of the\nothers. Jimmy easily eluded it and dropped the ship a few yards. The\ncreature pursued it, but it moved slowly. For a mile we kept our\ndistance ahead of it, but we had to constantly decrease our speed to\nkeep from leaving it behind. Soon we were almost at a standstill, and\nJim reversed our direction and drew nearer. A feeler came slowly and\nfeebly out a few feet toward us and then stopped. We dropped the ship a\nfew feet but the amoeba did not follow. Jim glanced at the altimeter.\n\n\"Just as I thought,\" he exclaimed. \"We are about forty-five miles above\nthe earth and already the air is so dense that the thing cannot move\nlower. They are fashioned for existence in the regions of space and in\neven the most rarified air they are helpless. There is no chance of one\never reaching the surface of the earth without years of gradual\nacclimation, and even if it did, it would be practically immobile. In a\nfew years the layer will flow enough to plug the hole I have made, but\neven so, I'll build a couple of space flyers equipped with\ndisintegrating rays as soon as we get down and station them alongside\nthe hole to wipe out any of that space vermin which tries to come\nthrough. Let's go home. We've put in a good day's work.\"\n\nHundreds of the purple amoeba have been destroyed by the guarding ships\nduring the past five years. The hole is filling in as Jim predicted, and\nin another ten years the earth will be as securely walled in as it ever\nwas. But in the mean time, no one knows what unrevealed horrors space\nholds, and the world will never rest entirely easy until the slow\nprocess of time again heals the broken protective layer.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEveryone Is Invited\n\n_To_ \"_Come Over in_\n\n'THE READERS' CORNER'\"!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n[Illustration: _The men of Cleric were surrounding Jaska._]\n\n\n\n\nEarth, the Marauder\n\nBEGINNING A THREE-PART NOVEL\n\n_By Arthur J. Burks_\n\n\nFOREWORD\n\n\n_Despite the fact that for centuries the Secret of Life had been the\npossession of children of men, the Earth was dying. She was dying\nbecause the warmth of the sun was fading; because, with the obliteration\nof the oceans in order to find new land upon which men might live, her\nseasons had become stormy, unbearably cold and dreary: and the very fact\nof her knowledge of the Secret of Life, in which men numbered their ages\nby centuries instead of by years, was her undoing._\n\n[Sidenote: Out of her orbit sped\nthe teeming Earth--a\nmarauding planet bent on starry\nconquest.]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n_For when men did not die, they multiplied beyond all counting, beyond\nall possibility of securing permanent abiding places. One man, in the\ndays when the earth was young, and man lived at best to the age of three\nscore years and ten, could have, given time and opportunity, populated a\nnation. Now, when men lived for centuries, eternally youthful, their\nliving descendants ran into incalculable numbers._\n\n_The earth--strange paradox--was dying because it had learned the Secret\nof Life. Twenty centuries before, the last war of aggression had been\nfought, in order that an over-populated nation might find room in which\nto live. Now all the earth was one nation, speaking one tongue--and\nthere were no more lands to conquer._\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n_Sarka_\n\n\nIn his laboratory atop the highest peak in the venerable Himalayas,\nlived Sarka, conceded by the world to be its greatest scientist, despite\nhis youth. His grandfather, who had watched the passing of eighteen\ncenturies, had discovered the Secret of Life and thoughtlessly, in the\nlight of later developments, broadcast his discovery to the world. The\ngenius of this man, who was also called Sarka, had been passed on to his\nson, Sarka the Second, and by him in even greater degree to Sarka the\nThird ... called merely Sarka for the purposes of this history.\n\nHad Sarka lived in the days before the discovery of the Secret of Life,\npeople of that day would have judged him a young man of twenty. His real\nage was four centuries.\n\nBehind him as he sat moodily staring at the gigantic Revolving Beryl\nstood a woman of most striking appearance. Her name was Jaska, and\naccording to ideas of the Days Before the Discovery, she seemed a trifle\nyounger than Sarka. Her hand, unadorned by jewelry of any kind, rested\non Sarka's shoulder as he studied the Revolving Beryl, while her eyes,\nwhose lashes, matching her raven hair, were like the wings of tiny\nblackbirds, noted afresh the wonder of this man.\n\n\"What is to be done?\" she asked him at last, and her voice was like\nmusic there in the room where science performed its miracles for Sarka.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWearily Sarka turned to face her, and she was struck anew, as she had\nbeen down the years since she had known this man, every time their\nglances met, at the mighty curve of his brow, which rendered\ninsignificant his mouth, his delicate nose of the twitching nostrils,\nthe well-deep eyes of him.\n\n\"Something must be done,\" he said gloomily, \"and that soon! For, unless\nthe children of men are provided with some manner of territorial\nexpansion, they will destroy one another, only the strongest will\nsurvive, and we shall return to the days when the waters covered the\nearth, and monstrous creatures bellowed from the primeval slime!\"\n\n\"You are working on something?\" she asked softly.\n\nFor a moment he did not answer. While she waited, Jaska peered into the\ndepths of the Revolving Beryl, which represented the earth. It was fifty\nfeet in diameter, and in its curved surface and entrancing depths was\nmirrored, in this latest development of teleview, all the earth and the\ndoings of its people. But Jaska scarcely saw the fleeting images, the\nmen locked in conflict for the right to live, the screaming,\nterror-stricken women. This was now a century-old story, and the\ncivilization of Earth had almost reached the breaking point.\n\nNo, she scarcely saw the things in the Beryl, for she had read the hint\nof a vast, awesome secret in the eyes of Sarka--and wondered if he dared\neven tell her.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"If the people knew,\" he whispered, \"they would do one of two things!\nThey would tear me limb from limb, and hurl the parts of me outward into\nspace forever--or they would demand that I move before I am ready--and\ncause a catastrophe which could never be rectified; and this grand old\nEarth of ours would be dead, indeed!\"\n\n\"And this secret of yours?\" Jaska now spoke in the sign language which\nonly these two knew, for there were billions of other Revolving Beryls\nin the world, and words could be heard by universal radio by any who\ncared to listen. And always, they knew, the legions of enemies of Sarka\nkept their ears open for words of Sarka which could be twisted around to\nhis undoing.\n\n\"I should not tell even you,\" he answered, his fingers working swiftly\nin their secret, silent language, which all the world could see, but\nwhich only these two understood. \"For if my enemies knew that you\npossessed the information, there is nothing they would stop at to make\nyou tell.\"\n\n\"But I would not tell, Sarka,\" she said softly. \"You know that!\"\n\nHe patted her hands, and the ghost of a smile touched his lips.\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"you would not tell. Some day soon--and it must be soon\nif the children of men are not to destroy themselves, I will tell you!\nIt is a secret that lies heavily on my heart. If I should make a\nmistake.... Chaos! Catastrophe! Eternal, perpetual dark, the children\nof men reduced to nothingness!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA little gasp from Jaska, for it was plain that this thing Sarka hinted\nat was far and away beyond anything he had hitherto done--and Sarka had\nalready performed miracles beyond any that had ever been done by his\npredecessors.\n\n\"When my grandfather,\" went on Sarka moodily, \"perfected, in this\nself-same laboratory, the machinery by which the waters of the oceans\ncould be disintegrated, our enemies called him mad, and fought their way\nup these mountain slopes to destroy him! With the pack at his doors, he\ndid as he had told them he would do. Though they hurried swiftly into\nthe great valleys to colonize them--where oceans had been--they were\nlike ravening beasts, and gave my grandfather no thanks. Our people have\nalways fought against progress, have always been disparaging of its\nadvocates! When the first Sarka discovered the Secret they would have\ndestroyed him, though he made them immortal....\"\n\n\"If only the Secret,\" interrupted Jaska, \"could be returned to him who\ndiscovered it! That would solve our problem, for men then would die and\nbe buried, leaving their places for others.\"\n\nAgain that weary smile on the face of Sarka.\n\n\"Take back the Secret which is known to-day to every son and daughter of\nwoman? Impossible! More nearly impossible than the attainment of my most\nambitious dream!\"\n\n\"And that dream?\" spoke Jaska with speeding fingers.\n\n\"I have wondered about you,\" said Sarka softly, while those eyes of his\nbored deeply into hers. \"We have been the best of friends, the best of\ncomrades; but there are times when it comes to me that I do not know you\nentirely! And I have many enemies!\"\n\n\"You mean,\" gasped the woman, for the moment forgetting the secret sign\nmanual, \"you think it possible that I--I--might be one of your enemies,\nin secret?\"\n\n\"Jaska, I do not know; but in this matter in my mind I trust no one. I\nam afraid even that people will read my very thoughts, though I have\nlearned to so concentrate upon them that not the slightest hint of them\nshall go forth telepathically to my enemies! I do not mind death for\nmyself; but our people must be saved! It is hideous to think that we\nhave been given the Secret of Life, only to perish in the end because of\nit! I am sorry, Jaska, but I can tell no one!\"\n\nBut Jaska, one of the most beautiful and intelligent of Earth's\nbeautiful and intelligent women, seemed not to be listening to Sarka at\nall, and when he had finished, she shrugged her shoulders slightly and\nprepared to leave.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe followed her to the nearest Exit Dome, built solidly into the side of\nhis laboratory, and watched her as she slipped swiftly into the white,\nskin-tight clothing--marked on breast and back with the Red Lily of the\nHouse of Cleric. His eyes still were deeply moody.\n\nHe helped her don the gleaming metal helmet in whose skull-pan was set\nthe Anti-Gravitational Ovoid--invented by Sarka the Second, used now of\nnecessity by every human creature--and strode with her to the Outer\nExit, a door of ponderous metal sufficiently strong to prevent the inner\nwarmth of the laboratory getting out, or the biting cold of the heights\nto enter, and studied her still as she buckled about her hips her own\npersonal Sarka-Belt, which automatically encased her, through contact\nwith her tight clothing, with the warmth and balanced pressure of the\nlaboratory, which would remain constant as long as she wore it.\n\nWith a nod and a brief smile, she stepped to the metal door and vanished\nthrough it. Sarka turned gloomily back to his laboratory. Looking into\nthe depths of the Revolving Beryl and adjusting the enlarging device\nwhich brought back, life size, the infinitesmal individuals mirrored in\nthe Beryl, he watched her go--a trim white figure which flashed across\nthe void, from mountain-top to her valley home, like a very white\nprojectile from another world. Very white, and very precious, but....\n\nWhen she was home, and had waved to him that she had arrived safely, he\nforgot her for a time, and allowed his eyes to study the inner workings\nof this vast, crowded world whose on-rushing fate was so filling his\nbrain with doubt, with fear--and something of horror!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n_The People of the Hives_\n\n\nMoodily Sarka stared into the depths of the Beryl, which represented the\nEarth, and in which he could see everything that earthlings did, after\nvisually enlarging them, through use of a microscope that could be\nadjusted, with relation to the Beryl, to bring out in detail any section\nof the world he wished to study. His face was utterly sad. The people at\nlast truly possessed the Earth--all of it that was, even with the aid of\nevery miracle known to science, habitable.\n\nThe surface of the Earth was one vast building, like a hive, and to each\nhuman being was allotted by law a certain abiding place. But men no\nlonger died, unless they desired to do so, and then only when the\nSpokesmen of the Gens saw fit to grant permission; and there soon would\nbe no place for the newborn to live. Even now that point had practically\nbeen reached throughout the world, and in the greater portion it _had_\nbeen reached, and passed, and men knew that while men did not die, they\ncould be killed!\n\nThe vast building, towering above what had once been the surface of the\nearth, to heights undreamed of before the discovery, was irregular on\nits top, to fit the contour of the earth, and its roof, constructed of\nmaterials raped from the earth's core, was so designed as to catch and\nconcentrate the yearly more feeble rays of the sun, so that its\nlife-giving warmth might continue to be the boon of living people.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt had been found as Earth cooled that life was possible to a depth of\neight miles below the one-time surface, so that the one huge building\nextended below the surface to this great depth, and was divided and\nre-divided to make homes for men, their wives, and their progeny. But\neven so, space was limited. Neighboring families outgrew their\nsurroundings, overflowed into the habitations of their neighbors--and\nevery family was at constant war against its neighbors.\n\nMen did not die, but they could be slain, and there was scarcely a home,\nabove or below, in all the vast building, which had not planned and\nexecuted murder, times and times--or which had not left its own blood in\nthe dwelling places of neighbors.\n\nNo law could cope with this intolerable situation, for men, down the\nages, had changed in their essential characteristics but little--and\nrecognized one law only in their extremity, that of self-preservation.\n\nSo there was murder rampant, and mothers who wept for children,\nhusbands, fathers or mothers, who would never return to their homes.\n\n\"My grandfather,\" whispered Sarka, his eyes peering deeply into a\ncertain area beyond that assigned by law to the House of Cleric, where\nmen of two neighboring families were locked in mortal, silent conflict,\n\"should not have frustrated the mad scheme of Dalis! It was slaughter,\nwholesale and terrible, but it would have cleansed the souls of the\nsurvivors!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMentally Sarka was looking back now to that red day when Dalis, the\nclosest scientific rival of Sarka the First, had come to Sarka the\nFirst with his proposal which at the time had seemed so hideous. Sarka\nremembered that interval in all its details, for he had heard it many\ntimes.\n\n\"Sarka,\" Dalis had said in his high-pitched voice, staring at Sarka the\nFirst out of red-rimmed, fiery eyes, \"unless something is done the world\nwill rush on to self-destruction! Men will slay one another! Fathers\nwill kill their sons, and sons their fathers, if something is not done!\nFor always there is marrying and giving in marriage, and each family is\nreaching out in all directions, seeking merely space in which to live.\nFormerly there were wars which automatically took thought of the\noverplus of men; but to-day the world is at peace, as men regard the\nterm--and every man's hand is against his neighbor! There will be no\nmore wars, when there should be! There is but one alternative!\"\n\n\"And that?\" Sarka the First had queried suspiciously.\n\n\"The segregation of the fittest! The destruction, swiftly, painlessly,\nof all the others! And when the survivors have again re-populated the\nearth to overflowing--a repetition of the same corrective! Men will die,\nyes, by millions; but those who are left will be a stronger, sturdier\nrace, and by this process of elimination, century by century, men will\nevolve and become super-men!\"\n\n\"And this plan of yours?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a moment Dalis had paused, breathing heavily, as though almost\nafraid to continue. Then, while Sarka the First had listened in frozen\nterror, Dalis had explained his ghastly scheme.\n\n\"If it were not for the mountains and the valleys,\" said Dalis, \"and the\nworld were perfectly round and smooth of surface, that surface would be\ncovered by water to the depth of one mile! Is that not correct! The\nEarth, rotating on its axis, travels about the sun at the rate of\nsomething like nineteen miles per second, so perfectly balanced that\nthe oceans remain almost quiescent in their beds! But, Sarka, mark me\nwell! If we could, together, devise a way to halt this rotation for as\nmuch as a few seconds, what would happen?\"\n\n\"What would happen?\" repeated Sarka the First, dropping his own voice to\na husky, frightened whisper. \"Why, the oceans would be hurled out of\ntheir beds, and a wall of water a mile high or more--it is all\nguesswork!--would rush eastward around the world, bearing everything\nbefore it! It would uproot and destroy buildings, sweep the rocky\ncovering of the earth free of soil; and humanity, caught on the earth\nbelow the highest level of the world's greatest tidal wave, would be\nengulfed!\"\n\n\"Exactly!\" Dalis had said with a grin. \"Exactly! Only--the people we\nwish to survive could be warned, and these could either be aloft when\nthe tidal wave swept the face of the earth, or could be safely out of\nreach of the waters on the sides of the highest mountains!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSarka the First, wanly smiling, catching his breath at last, now that he\nrealized the utter impossibility of this mad scheme, had been minded to\nhumor the fancies of a man whom he had believed not quite sane.\n\n\"Why not,\" he began, \"take away from men the Secret of Life, so that\nthey will die, as formerly, when the world was young?\"\n\n\"When all the world knows the Secret, when even children learn it before\nthey are capable of walking?\" demanded Dalis sarcastically. \"You could\nonly remove knowledge of the Secret from the brains of men by removing\nthose brains themselves! Your thought is more terrible even than mine,\nbecause it leads to this inescapable conclusion!\"\n\n\"But supposing for a moment your mad scheme were possible, who should\nsay whom, of all the earth's people, should be saved, whom sacrificed?\"\n\n\"What better test could be given than that which I am proposing?\" Dalis\nhad snarled. \"Those worthy of being saved would save themselves! Those\nwho would perish would not be worth saving! As natural, as inescapable\nas the law of the survival of the fittest, which has been an axiom of\nlife since men first crawled out of the slime and asked each other\nquestions as they caught their first glimpses of the stars and pondered\nthe reasons for them!\"\n\n\"But where, then, was there any point in my giving to people the Secret\nof Life?\"\n\n\"Had you paused to think,\" snapped Dalis, \"you would never have done so!\nYour lust for power, and for fame, destroyed your foresight!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"And is it not, Dalis,\" replied Sarka the First, softly, \"for this,\nreally, that you have come to me? To berate me? To throw at my head mad\nschemes impossible of accomplishment? I have always known you for an\nenemy, Dalis, because you are envious of what I have accomplished, what\nyou sense that I will accomplish as time passes!\"\n\n\"I do not love you, Sarka!\" retorted Dalis frankly. \"I despise you! Hate\nyou! But I need the aid of that keen brain of yours! You see, hate you\nthough I may, I do you honor still. I have something up here,\" tapping\nthe dome of his brow, only less lofty than that of Sarka, \"which you\nlack. You have something I have not, never can attain! But together we\nare complements, each of the other, and to the two of us this scheme is\npossible!\"\n\n\"I am very busy, Dalis,\" Sarka the First had replied coldly. \"I must ask\nyou to leave me! What you propose is impossible, unthinkable!\"\n\n\"So,\" retorted Dalis, \"you think me mad? You think me incapable of\nperfecting this plan about whose details you have not even yet been\ninformed! You would show me the door as though you were a king and I a\nslave--when kings and slaves vanished from the earth millenniums ago!\nThen listen to me, Sarka! I know how to do this thing about which I have\ntold you. I can halt, for a brief moment only, the whirl of the earth\nabout its axis. And by so doing I can flood the earth with the waters of\nthe oceans! If you will not listen to me, I shall do it myself! You\nshall have two days in which to give me an answer, for I admit that I\nneed you, who would balance me, make sure I made no fatal mistakes! But\nif you do not, I will act ... along the lines I have hinted!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nApparently as unconcerned as though he had not just listened to a scheme\nfor almost total depopulation of the world, the destruction of millions\nupon millions of lives, Sarka the First had dismissed Dalis--who had\nstraightway used all his offices to arouse the world of science against\nthe first Sarka.\n\nBut, when the two days of grace given by Dalis had passed, there were no\noceans--for Sarka the First had been planning for a century against the\ntime when the earth must of necessity be over-populated, and had worked\nand slaved in his laboratory against the contingency which had\ndeveloped.\n\nHe had smiled, though there was a trace of fear on his face after Dalis\nhad left, for _his_ scheme had been worked out--not to destroy, but to\nsave!\n\nAnd from this same laboratory in which Sarka now sat and pondered on the\nnext step in man's expansion, Sarka the First had, in fear and trembling\nat first, but with his confidence growing by leaps and bounds, worked\nhis own miracle. Untold millions and billions of rays, whose any portion\nof which, coming in contact with water, immediately separated its\nhydrogen and oxygen, thus disintegrating its molecules, were hurled\nforth from their store-houses beneath the laboratory, across the faces\nof the mighty oceans of Earth....\n\nAnd when men saw the miracle, they rushed into the mighty valleys where\nthe oceans had been, and began to build new homes!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat had been centuries ago--scores of centuries.\n\nNow all the earth, all the livable part of the earth, above its\nsurface--and below it to the depths of miles--was filled with people,\nlike bees in a monster hive, like ants of antiquity in their warrened\nhills. And there was no place now that they could go.\n\nSo they fought among themselves for the right to live.\n\n\"But my grandfather was right!\" Sarka almost screamed it, speaking aloud\nin the silence of his laboratory. \"My grandfather was right! Dalis was\nwrong! Science should be the science of Life, not of Death! Yet whither\nshall we go! Where now shall we find places for our people who are daily\nbeing born in myriads, to live, and love and flourish?\"\n\nBut there was no answer. Only the humming of the perpetually revolving\nBeryl, which showed to the sad eyes of Sarka that the people of his\nbeloved earth were rushing onward to Chaos, unless....\n\n\"If only I could be sure about Jaska!\" he moaned. \"If only my courage\nwere as great as that of which I stand in need! For if I fail, even\nDalis, had he succeeded with that scheme of his in grandfather's time,\nwould be less a monster, less a criminal!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n_The Spokesmen of the Gens_\n\nFor a long moment Sarka looked broodingly out across the world beyond\nthe metalized glass which formed the curving dome of his laboratory\nroof. There was little that could be seen, for always the mighty, cold\nwinds, ruffed with flurries of snow and particles of ice, swept over\nthis artificial roof of the world. Here and there huge portions of the\narea within the range of his normal vision were swept clear and clean of\nsnow and ice--and looked bluely, bitterly cold and hostile.\n\nWithout the Sarka-Belts, people who ventured forth from their hives\nwould instantly freeze to the consistency of marble in those winds and\nstorms. For the people of Earth had built their monster habitation\ntoward the stars until they reached up into the altitude of perpetual\ncold.\n\nOnly under that gleaming roof was there warmth. Many of the men, and\nwomen, and children who had lost in the now century-old fight for\nsurvival had merely been tossed out of the hives. A painless, swift\ndeath--but each death, in a world so highly specialized that each grown\nperson fitted into his niche naturally and easily, was a distinct loss,\nnot much, perhaps, but enough for the loss to be felt.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSarka, closing his eyes for a moment as though to shut out a horror\nwhich in his mind he could visualize, turned back to the Revolving\nBeryl, in which he kept in constant touch with all parts of the world at\nwill.\n\n\"It _must_ be done!\" he muttered. \"I must take action. It means the loss\nof thousands, perhaps millions of lives, in such a war as the mind of\nman has not hitherto conceived; but for a Cause greater than any which\nhas ever hitherto been an excuse for armed conflict. But I must discuss\nit with the Spokesmen of the Gens!\"\n\nOn the table before Sarka was a row of vari-colored lights, whose source\nwas beneath the floor of the laboratory, out of the heart of the\nmaster-mountain, part of the intricate machinery of this laboratory\nwhich had been almost twenty centuries in the perfecting. In the\ndwelling place of each of the Spokesmen was a single light, colored like\none of the lights on Sarka's table. To speak with any one of the\nSpokesmen Sarka had but to dim the properly colored light by covering it\nwith the palm of his hand. The light in the home of the thus signalled\nSpokesman was dimmed, and the Spokesman would know that Sarka desired\nto converse with him.\n\nSarka noted the blue light, and shuddered. For if he covered it with his\npalm it would summon Dalis, a great scientist, but an erratic one, as\nSarka the First had so clearly shown.\n\nSarka turned again to the Beryl. The area of which Dalis was Spokesman\nwas, roughly speaking, that part of what had once been the Pacific\nOcean, north of a line drawn east and west through the southernmost of\nthe Hawaiian Islands, northward to the Pole. The home of Dalis was in\nthe heart of what had once been an island historians claimed had been\ncalled Oahu, now a mountain peak still retaining a hint of the\npre-Discovery name: Ohi.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe total number of the Spokesmen, the oldest of earth's inhabitants,\nwas twelve, and the remainder of the Earth not under the tutelary rule\nof Dalis was divided up among the other eleven Spokesmen. Cleric, for\nexample, father of Jaska, was Spokesman of that area which men had once\ncalled Asia, the vast valleys of the once Indian Ocean and the\nMediterranean; while the youngest of the Spokesmen, in a manner serving\nhis apprenticeship, was tutelary head of the vast plateau once called\nAfrica. The name of this man was Gerd.\n\n\"He, at least,\" thought Sarka, thinking of each Spokesman in turn and\ncataloguing each in his mind, \"will be with me. I wonder about the\nothers, and especially Dalis. He has always hated us!\"\n\nThen, with the air of a man who has made up his mind and crosses his\nparticular Rubicon in a single step, Sarka rose to his feet and passed\nalong the row of vari-colored lights, covering each one with his hand in\nrapid succession.\n\nThen he sat down again, almost holding his breath, and waited. As he\nstared at the row of lights his eyes lingered longest on two which were\nalmost golden in color--and his face was very gentle, almost reverent.\nFor those two lights were signals to Sarka the First and Sarka the\nSecond, his grandfather and his father!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was Dalis, the irascible, the fiery tempered, the erratic, who first\nmade answer.\n\n\"Yes! What is it now?\"\n\nSarka smiled a trifle grimly as he spoke a single word.\n\n\"Wait!\"\n\nThe voice of Dalis, which Sarka had good cause to remember, had sounded\nas loudly in the laboratory as though Dalis had been present there in\nperson, for men had learned to communicate by voice almost without the\naid of radio and its appurtenances though the principle upon which the\nfirst crude beginnings of radio were fashioned still applied. Each man's\ndwelling place was both a \"sender\" and a \"receiver,\" and men could talk\nand be talked to no matter where they lived--individuals telepathically\nsummoned at desire of anyone wishing verbal contact.\n\n\"Gerd is here!\" came the voice of that Spokesman.\n\nTo him also Sarka spoke one word.\n\n\"Wait!\"\n\n\"I am here, Sarka!\" came a musical voice. \"And Jaska is with me,\nlistening!\"\n\nThat would be Cleric, loyal friend, master scientist, but always shy of\ncontact with people, though swift to anger and self-forgetfulness when\nhe knew himself right and was opposed. Sarka darted a look back at the\nRevolving Beryl, adjusted swiftly the Beryl-microscope, and smiled into\nthe faces of Jaska and Cleric, who looked enough alike that they might\nhave been brother and sister, though Cleric had been born ten centuries\nbefore his daughter Jaska. They smiled back at him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe shifted the Beryl-microscope and stared for a second at Dalis, there\nin the Beryl, and marked the antagonism Dalis was at no pains to hide.\n\nOne by one the Spokesmen reported.\n\nKlaser, from the Americas; Durce from the valleys of the vanished\nAtlantic; Boler from that part of the Artic Circle not included in the\nwedge which the Gens of Dalis thrust northward to the Pole: Vardee;\nPrull; Yuta; Aal; Vance and Hime. Each from his appointed area, each\nfrom the official headquarters of his Gens, the name given to those\npeople who acknowledged the tutelage of a Spokesman. Each Spokesman,\ntherefore, was the mouthpiece of millions of men, women and children.\nAnd over the Spokesmen, and not themselves Spokesmen, were three\nscientists: The Sarkas, First, Second and Third.\n\nWhen all twelve of the Spokesmen had reported and been bidden by Sarka\nto wait, a smile touched the face of Sarka for an instant as two other\nvoices, so nearly alike they might have been the voice of a single\nperson, reported themselves.\n\n\"I am here, son! What is it?\"\n\nOddly enough, Sarka's father and grandfather reported with exactly the\nsame words. Sarka smiled at a whimsical thought of his own. It had been\nsome time since the three scientist Sarkas had been together, and\ndespite the vast differences in their ages they might have been\ntriplets!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe reports were in and the Spokesmen were waiting; but for almost a\nminute Sarka waited still. Then he spoke swiftly those words for which\nthere could be no recall:\n\n\"Gentlemen, the time is come when we must go to war!\"\n\nFor a long moment after he had spoken there was no answer. Then it came,\nin the jeering laughter of the antagonistic Dalis.\n\n\"War? Against whom? The Sarkas are always dreaming!\"\n\n\"And Dalis,\" continued Sarka, \"shall be one of the leaders of Earthlings\nin this war which I am about to propose! You doubtless recall a proposal\nyou once made to Sarka the First? Your proposal to halt for a few\nmoments the headlong whirl of the earth about its axis, thus to\nflood--\"\n\n\"Stop!\" interrupted Dalis. \"Stop! Immediately!\"\n\nAnd Sarka stopped. He had forgotten, in the excitement of his urge to\nexplain his plans, that the millions of people who gave official\nallegiance to Dalis had never been informed of the hideous proposal he\nhad made, back there centuries ago, as a corrective for a world rapidly\napproaching over-population. Had his people known, never again would the\nvoice of Dalis be heard in life. The Spokesmen knew, and the Sarkas; but\nno others. Sarka understood the protest of Dalis; honored it.\n\n\"Dalis,\" he went on, more softly, \"after I have explained what I wish to\ndo, you will come to me here, prepared to explain to me exactly how you\nplanned doing what you proposed to my grandfather--for your knowledge\nwill be necessary to me....\"\n\n\"Isn't it enough that your grandfather stole from me, and amplified, an\nidea that would have made me forever famous, without his grandson also\nstealing the fruit of my brains?\"\n\n\"Your brains,\" said Sarka sharply, \"belong to your people. What I plan\nis for their betterment. But it means war, war which may last a century,\ntwo centuries, in which lives of countless thousands may be lost.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSarka's last words were almost drowned out by the humming sound that\ncame out of the Revolving Beryl, that perfected device which was the\nultimate in the evolution of television and vibration-transference.\nSarka's heart sank, for he knew the meaning of that sound. So did the\nSpokesmen.\n\n\"You see?\" came the rasping voice of Dalis. \"You hear? Look into your\nBeryl! See the clenched fists of the earth's myriads being shaken at\nyou! Listen to the protests of the millions who hear your every word!\nSee what Earthlings think of the prospect of war!\"\n\nFor a moment Sarka spoke directly to the people.\n\n\"Be silent and listen! It will be war, yes; but not such a skulking,\nhideous war as ye wage among yourselves for a place to live! You,\nfathers, are guilty of slaying your sons! You, sons, of slaying your\nfathers! Merely by thrusting them forth from the hives, into the Outer\nCold! This war I propose shall be a war that shall match your manhood,\nif ye indeed be men! Listen to me, and I will find for you new lands to\nconquer, new homes for your holding, if ye can take them!\"\n\n\"But where,\" interrupted the sarcastic voice of Dalis, \"are these new\nlands of which you speak? Inside the Earth? Already our hives reach into\nthe Earth a distance of eight miles. Where else, then?\"\n\n\"For shame, Dalis!\" snapped Sarka, \"and you a scientist! Every bit of\nhabitable land on this globe is some man's dwelling place! Spokesmen of\nthe Gens of Earth, look out your windows! Look out and upward--and read\nDalis' answer in the stars!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a full minute there was silence throughout the earth, and Sarka saw\nthat the Spokesmen were doing his bidding. He himself looked out, out\nthrough the swirling storm which tore at the crest of the Himalayas, a\ndark and forbidding Outside, in the starred dome of which rode the pale\norbed moon!\n\n\"It is obvious, son,\" came the voice of Sarka the First, \"what you mean.\nBut how accomplish it?\"\n\n\"Fifteen centuries ago, my father's father,\" cried Sarka, \"Dalis told\nyou that he possessed the power to halt for a moment the headlong whirl\nof the world on its axis about the sun! He could do it then--and no man,\nwhatever he may think of Dalis as a man, has ever known him to lie! If,\nfifteen centuries ago, he could bring the whirling world to pause, why\ncan we not, now....\"\n\nAnd, even though he had thought of this for years upon end, had spoken\nover and over to himself the words he was now using, rehearsing his\nproposed argument to the Spokesmen of the Gens, Sarka found himself for\na moment almost afraid to continue and speak them.\n\n\"I understand, Sarka!\" came the excited voice of Gerd, youngest of the\nSpokesmen. \"And I follow wherever you think it best to lead! You mean\n... you mean....\"\n\n\"Exactly!\" Sarka managed at last. \"If the Earth can be stayed on its\naxis, it can be diverted from its orbit entirely! I know, for I have\nfound the manner of its doing, though I need the genius of Dalis to\ncheck my work and my calculations! We have no new land on this Earth to\nconquer; but the Universe is filled with countless other worlds! What\nsay ye, Spokesmen of the Gens? What say ye, Gens of Earth?\"\n\nBut for the time of a thousand heartbeats neither the Spokesmen or the\nGens made answer to Sarka, and all the world fell utterly silent,\nabsorbing this unbelievable thing of which Sarka had hinted.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOver the metalized roof of the world the snows and storms, the winds and\nthe wraiths of the long dead moaned and screamed as with an icy voice of\nabysmal warning.\n\nAnd for the time of those thousand heartbeats, the world was pausing to\nlisten.\n\nWhen realization came, the answer would come from the Spokesmen and from\nthe Gens; and here in the Sarka laboratory, his Rubicon crossed at last,\nsat Sarka, staring through the Beryl-microscope into the depths of the\nRevolving Beryl. His face was dead white, his eyes narrowed.\n\nThe first voice which came startled him.\n\n\"It is mad, Sarka! Mad! Mad! But I am with you, always!\"\n\nIt was the voice of Jaska, daughter of Cleric!\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n_The Earthlings Make Ready_\n\n\"I too, am with you!\" came the voice of Gerd.\n\n\"Spoken like a child!\" snapped Dalis. \"For you are as much a child as\nthis third of the dreaming Sarkas! The scheme is mad, madder even than\nJaska intimates! The scheme I once proposed, in which I was cheated by\nthe grandfather of this madman, was times and times more feasible and\npracticable!\"\n\n\"Suppose,\" came the soft voice of Sarka the First, interrupting Dalis,\n\"that you put the matter up to your Gens, O wise and noble Dalis, and\nsee which scheme they would endorse if given the choice in the\nmatter--and were your scheme still possible!\"\n\nThis quickly silenced the vituperation of Dalis, but in no wise\nprevented his continuance as a rather loud antagonist of the plan.\n\n\"How,\" he demanded, \"can you return the Earth to its orbit, even\ngranting you are able to take this initial step? How keep life on the\nEarth during its flight on this rainbow-chasing voyage you propose?\"\n\n\"All these things have been taken into consideration, O Dalis!\" retorted\nSarka. \"All of my scheme is practicable, as I think you will agree when\nI have told you its details. What think you of the plan, Klaser? And\nyou, Durce? Boler? Vardee? Prull? Yuta? Aal? Vance? Hime?\"\n\nWhen the Spokesmen had answered, some of them hesitantly, for the people\nall this time had remained silent--and none of the Spokesmen could be\nsure how his own Gens would feel in the matter--it developed that seven\nof the Spokesmen were for the scheme, if it should prove to be possible.\n\n\"If this is the voice of the majority of the Gens,\" snapped Dalis,\n\"given thus by their Spokesmen, then I vote with the majority! I shall\ncall upon you immediately, Sarka, for a conference!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I am glad,\" said Sarka softly, \"that the majority of the Spokesmen are\nwith me. Especially am I glad that Dalis and Cleric vote with me. For\nthe others I have only this to say: I have thought this matter over for\nalmost a century, and I know that the time has come when we must act, to\nsave ourselves from self-destruction. Had you not decided with me, I\nshould have acted alone!\"\n\n\"Yes?\" snapped Dalis. \"How?\"\n\n\"I have, here in my laboratory,\" replied Sarka, \"the power whereby to\naccomplish the scheme of which I have told you! Had all the Gens defied\nme, I would have nevertheless sent the Earth outward on its voyage,\nbringing it within reach of the denizens, first of the Moon, second of\nMars--and you people of little courage would have been compelled to\nfight to save yourselves!\"\n\n\"You would have forced us into war?\" came the quavering voice of Prull,\nthe first Spokesman aside from Dalis to take active part in the\ndiscussion. \"Then why, if you had the means in the beginning to enforce\nyour will upon us, confer with us at all?\"\n\nSarka thrilled with satisfaction, for this question gave him the excuse\nhe sought. He had been wondering and scheming how to compel the\nSpokesmen of the Gens to obey his will.\n\n\"I wanted your opinions,\" he said shortly. \"But I also wish you to know\nthat I have the power to go on, whether you wish it or not--_and you\nmust obey me!_\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHow would the twelve Gens take this ultimatum of Sarka? For breathless\nmoments after he had spoken he waited, and the Spokesmen with him. Then\ncame the voice of Cleric, addressing his people, yet leaving the\ncontacts open so that Sarka and the other Spokesmen might hear.\n\n\"What say you, O Gens of Cleric?\" he cried, his voice an exultant,\nclarioning paean of rejoicing. \"Do we follow this man who promises us\nlife again? Do we follow this man who promises us that once again we\nshall dwell in plenty, without the blood of relatives and neighbors on\nour hands? Answer this man, O Gens--for I say unto you that wheresoever\nhe leads I would follow him!\"\n\nSilence for a heartbeat. Then a murmuring like the sound of the waves of\nthe long-vanished seas sounded in the laboratory, wherein all things\nwere seen, all sounds were heard. A monster voice, loud and savage, from\nthe Gens of Cleric.\n\n\"We follow Cleric wherever he leads!\" Finally the words became\nintelligible. \"It matters not to us whom Cleric follows, so long as we\nmay follow Cleric!\"\n\n\"Well spoken, O Gens of Cleric!\" snapped Sarka when the murmuring died\ndown to a whisper, then faded out entirely. \"Deck yourselves in the\nwhite garments of Cleric! Emblazon upon your backs and breast the Red\nLily of his House! Prepare for war! These are your orders; the details I\nleave to Cleric!\"\n\nThere came the voice Dalis.\n\n\"Give your orders to my Gens direct, O Sarka!\" rasped Dalis. \"For I\nleave this very moment to come to you!\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Sarka, a great wave of exaltation sweeping over him.\nHe had expected Dalis to be the last and most difficult to manage. Then\nto the Gens of Dalis, as the blue light on the table in the laboratory\nshowed Sarka that Dalis was already winging toward him: \"Deck yourselves\nin the green garments of Dalis! Wear as your insignia the yellow star of\nhis House, and prepare for war! Make new and modern Ray Directors!\nRefurbish your rotting machines of destruction! Make ready, and make\nhaste! For the Gens of Dalis will be the first of all the Gens to move\nin attack against the Dwellers Outside! When the time comes I shall tell\nyou where you shall dwell--if you win the land I shall show you!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe humming of myriad voices inside the laboratory was now almost\ncontinuous, but ever the words of Sarka went out to the Spokesmen and to\nthe Gens, though, save in the case of Cleric and of Dalis, he did not\nspeak to the Gens direct, because he did not wish in one iota to usurp\nthe authority of the Spokesmen themselves.\n\nBut when less than an hour had passed, he realized that the first step\nhad been successfully taken, and that from now on the success or failure\nof the scheme rested in his own hands. Perspiration bedewed his\nforehead, and for a second he prayed.\n\n\"God of our fathers! Grant that we be not mistaken! Grant that we be\nright in what we plan! Grant that success attend our arms! Grant that\nthis scheme of mine lead us not to catastrophe--for if this should\ndevelop, only I am guilty, and only I should be punished!\"\n\n\"Amen!\"\n\nAs one voice, the Spokesmen of the Gens spoke the word, and Sarka heard\nit. He had forgotten for the moment that the Spokesmen still could hear\nhim.\n\n\"That is all,\" he said huskily. \"Prepare your Gens, each of you, for\nsuch battle as even our histories never have recorded! For we go against\nfoemen whose strength we do not know, whose manner of life we do not\nknow, and we must not fail! Make haste with your preparations! Your time\nis short! And Spokesmen, counsel your Gens that they put aside at once\nall personal differences, all family quarrels, all quarrels with their\nneighbors! That each adult individual, each unmarried woman, and such\nmarried woman as have all their children grown, and who no longer need\nthem, prepare to go forth to battle! From this laboratory, within a\nbrief space, Dalis and the Sarkas will give you further word!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen he dimmed the lights, and severed contact with the Spokesmen of the\nGens. Only two lights he did not dim, at the moment, and to two men he\nspoke softly.\n\n\"My father and my father's father! Come to me at once! For there shall\nbe need of the combined genius of the Sarkas if my scheme is to\nsucceed!\"\n\nFrom both Sarkas, as though they had rehearsed the words against this\nneed of them, came answer:\n\n\"Aye, son, we come!\"\n\nFrom that moment on until Dalis and the Sarkas were ready to take the\nmost momentous step ever taken in the history of the world, the humming\nwithin the laboratory did not cease. For the people, the millions and\nbillions of people of the hives, were busy, eagerly and feverishly busy,\npreparing new armament, new engines of destruction, against the time\nwhen there should be need of them. And for perhaps the first time in\ncenturies, the people were happy.\n\nFor not even the passage of a thousand centuries, or a thousand thousand\ncenturies, could flush from the warm hearts of men the love of conflict!\n\nSarka smiled wanly, his face very pale. He had spoken, his people were\nbusy with preparations, and now there could be no turning back. The\nworld, when he spoke the word, would rush outward to glorious\nconflict--or to destruction!\n\nA buzzer sounded near the Exit Dome. Sarka raced to give the \"Enter\"\nSignal--and Dalis, he of the hawk-eyes, the sharp nose and sharper\ntongue, entered the presence of the man who, in a twinkling, had made\nhimself master of the world.\n\n\"Well,\" he said harshly, \"I am here! What do you wish of me?\"\n\n\"We Sarkas,\" said Sarka easily, \"wish to assure ourselves that you will\ndo nothing to obstruct our plans! Dalis, of the Gens of Dalis, you are\nprisoner of the Sarkas until you have passed your word!\"\n\n\"That I will never do!\" said Dalis calmly. \"I have passed my word to go\nforward with you; but I meant, and you knew I meant, to go forward only\nas far as to me seemed right and reasonable!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n_The Betrayal of Dalis_\n\nAnd until the arrival of the other two Sarkas, Dalis said nothing. His\nface flushed an angry red as Sarka the First received the \"Enter\" Signal\nand stepped into the laboratory which had once been his--which he had\ndelivered into the capable hands of Sarka the Second, in order to find\nnew channels for his genius, as a worker for the betterment of the\nworld's people. This he had found in organization, so that the people\nworked and labored, despite their personal quarrels, in closer harmony\nthan they ever had before. But now Sarka the Third had called, and the\ntwo Sarkas responded. Dalis snarled at his ancient enemy, who looked to\nbe the image of Sarka the Third and not one whit older, though one had\npreceded the other into the world by many centuries.\n\n\"Still the pleasant, congenial Dalis, I see!\" smiled Sarka the First.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor the moment it seemed that Dalis would die there of his seething\nanger; but he answered no word for all of a minute. Then:\n\n\"This mad grandson of yours has made me a prisoner, until such time as I\nconcur in all his plans!\"\n\n\"If he says you are a prisoner, that you are!\" snapped the elder Sarka\nangrily. \"Son, what is this thing you plan?\"\n\n\"For almost a century,\" replied Sarka, \"I have been planning this. I\nknew, when father told me that Dalis had sworn he was able to halt for a\nmoment the headlong flight of the Earth in its orbit, that Dalis did not\nlie or bluff! In your day, even, that was possible, and I continued with\nthe knotty problem until I deduced the manner of its doing. I, too, can\nhalt the Earth's rotation, or throw it out of its orbit! I took your\nidea, Dalis, _independently_ of you, knowing you would never reveal\nyour secret to a Sarka, and amplified it until I can not only halt the\nEarth in its orbit, but throw it out of its orbit entirely!\"\n\nFor a moment Sarka studied the angry face of Dalis, and his own was very\nthoughtful.\n\n\"Dalis,\" he said at last, \"I wish you were not our enemy! For you are a\ngenius, and the world has need of all the knowledge of such genius as it\npossesses. Why do you oppose us?\"\n\n\"Because,\" snarled Dalis, \"I guessed something of your plan that I do\nnot like! I do not like the Sarkas, never have; but neither have the\nSarkas any love for me! When you spoke to us all, I knew that somehow\nyou had discovered the secret! You spoke, when you delivered your\nultimatum, of attacking the Moon, and after it Mars! You also granted to\nmy Gens what would have seemed a great honor--to anyone who did not\nfathom the tricky scheming of the Sarkas!--that of being the first into\nthe fray! If we are to be first, and the Moon is to be the first\nattacked, then you plan to relieve the world forever of me, your\narch-enemy, by exiling me and all my Gens upon the Moon! A dead world,\ncovered with ashes, whose people dwell in dank caverns, like gnomes of\nthe underworld....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Stay!\" snapped Sarka. \"But I granted you a greater honor even than\nthat, Dalis! I planned on your Gens, led by you, making a successful\nconquest of the Moon--because only such a genius as Dalis could force\nfrom this dead world a living for his Gens! Because you are the wisest\nof the Spokesmen, I planned for you the greatest task! Because I need\nyou ... I do not slay you!\"\n\n\"I thank you,\" bowing low, with the deepest sarcasm, \"but you honor me\ntoo much! And tell me, pray, if it is not true that you plan for the\nSarkas their choice of the best and newest worlds of the Universe?\"\n\nSarka did not answer for a second, while his sensitive nostrils quivered\nwith fury. The Sarkas had not noticed, but Jaska, daughter of Cleric,\nhad admitted herself through the Exit Dome, in a way known only to Sarka\nand to herself, as she had entered many times before so as not to\ndisturb Sarka at his labors. She now stood silently there, divesting\nherself of her Belt and outer clothing, beneath which was the golden\ntoga worn by all the women of the earth. Dalis, however, had seen her,\nand his eyes narrowed craftily as he awaited the answer of Sarka.\n\n\"Dalis,\" said Sarka softly, \"it is not for you to question me, but to\nobey me! I have not undertaken this step without mastering all its\ndetails, and I refuse to allow you to swerve me in a single one of them\nfrom my plan.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDalis straightened, standing stiffly at savage attention, and met the\nangry eyes of Sarka without flinching. There was no fear in Dalis, as\nall the world knew. But he was a schemer, and selfish.\n\n\"After all,\" he said, \"I have known Sarkas to make promises they could\nnot keep! How do I know, how does the world know, that you can do what\nyou say you can do?\"\n\n\"If,\" said Sarka, \"I close all contact of this laboratory with the world\noutside, so that none may hear what I say save we four, and I then\nwhisper here the secret you never told, Dalis, when my father's father\nrefused to help you--will you then believe?\"\n\nThe face of Dalis went suddenly white, but he nodded, his eyes burning\nredly. Jaska moved closer to the men, who stood near the table of the\nvari-colored lights.\n\n\"You needed my father's father,\" said Sarka softly, \"because the secret\nof your scheme rested here in this laboratory, which is the highest\npoint in the world! You pretended to need him in your scheme; but you\ndid not need my father's father, though you _did_ need his laboratory,\nand some of the facts of science that _he_ discovered. So you came to\nhim with your scheme, discovered that he believed, though he denied it,\nyour scheme was possible--because he refused to aid you in it! Then, as\nan excuse to re-enter this laboratory, you told him you would return\nwithin two days! Now, shall I tell you your secret?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe lips of Dalis were moving soundlessly. His right hand started to\nrise, as though he would make it signal the negative he was unable for a\nmoment to speak. But even as he stood there, swaying slightly on his\nfeet, Sarka dashed to the lights on the table, disconnecting them one by\none; to the Revolving Beryl, which then ceased to revolve for the first\ntime in centuries--whirled when he had finished, and stepped to the very\ncenter of the room.\n\n\"Now,\" he whispered, \"your secret, Dalis!\"\n\nStill the hand upraised, still Dalis tried to speak, and could not.\n\nSarka spoke, in a hoarse, almost terrified whisper, four words:\n\n\"The Beryl! The Ovoids!\"\n\nGasps of surprise from the other two Sarkas, whose eyes for a second\nflashed to the huge Beryl, which now was still, silent--and blind.\nDawning comprehension was evident in their faces.\n\n\"The success of the Revolving Beryl,\" whispered Sarka, \"which sees all\nthat transpires in this world, depends on one fact: that its revolving\nis proportionately timed to infinite exactness with the revolution of\nthe Earth about its axis! This Beryl is the Master Beryl of the Earth,\nwhich was why Dalis needed this Beryl, and could use no other!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Suppose that for a period of two days, uniformly progressive, this\nBeryl were forced to revolve in sharp jerks at an increasing rate of\nspeed! With all connections in place, and all the world's Beryls attuned\nto the speed of this one--what would happen? What would happen if a\nsingle Gens were marshalled in warlike array atop the area of the Gens,\nand kept up a steady, rhythmic march for a period of hours?\"\n\n\"In a few hours,\" whispered Sarka the First, \"the roof of the Gens area\nwould begin to vibrate, to vibrate throughout all the area, and even\ninto all surrounding Gens areas--and in time the roof would collapse!\"\n\n\"Exactly!\" said Sarka, breathing heavily. \"This Beryl, when attuned to\nall other Beryls in the world, would have this vibratory effect, not\nonly on a certain area of the world--but upon the entire world!--Force\nthe speed of the Beryls to the uttermost limit, and you sway the world\nto your will! As a marching horde would sway the roof of a vast section\nof the world if the horde's commander willed!\n\n\"But that is not enough! The world would tremble, but nothing more! The\nEarth's store of Ovidum, which is Anti-Gravitational, and used in minute\nquantities in our Anti-Gravitational Ovoids, is evenly distributed\nthroughout the world. By vibration of the Beryls I can control it,\nscatter it or gather it all together wherever I will! By shifting\nthrough vibration this Anti-Gravitational material, I can disrupt, make\nuneven, or nullify the pull of gravity on the Earth!\"\n\n\"That would do it,\" said Dalis, finding his voice at last; \"but how\nwould you control the course the Earth would take, thus thrown out of\nits orbit?\"\n\n\"That, my dear Dalis, is for the moment my secret!\"\n\n\"But is it?\" Dalis suddenly shouted.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBefore the three Sarkas could recover from their surprise at the man's\nsudden vehemence, he made a swift, terrifying move. He leaped away from\nthem to stand beside Jaska, daughter of Cleric.\n\n\"Sarka,\" he shrieked, \"I know you love this woman! Note this little tube\nI hold against her side. With it I can cause her to vanish for all time,\nmerely by a slight pressure of the fingers! And that will I do, unless\nyou immediately open all contacts with the world and remain silent while\nI tell the people of Earth how you would betray them!\"\n\nThe three Sarkas were petrified with amazement and horror, for they\nrecognized the slender tube in the hand of Dalis as a Ray Director, the\nworld's greatest engine of destruction, and knew that it would do\nexactly as Dalis had said it would.\n\nAutomatically, because they were brave men, they had stepped a trifle\ncloser to Jaska and Dalis. Perspiration poured from their cheeks as they\nstared at this rebel. But their fears were for Jaska, who now spoke for\nthe first time.\n\n\"Let him do as he wills,\" she said smilingly, \"since for the good of the\nworld I do not fear to die! Refuse him, Sarka, and know that I go into\nDeath's Darkness loving you always, and knowing that you will succeed in\nthe end, in spite of the opposition of men like Dalis!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA man of unexpected actions, this Dalis, for while the attentions of the\nSarkas were on the little tableau he had staged, his eyes had darted to\nthe Beryl, to the control which Sarka had touched to still its\nrevolving. Now he sprang away from Jaska, was free of her and the Sarkas\nbefore any could move to intercept him.\n\nHe dashed to the Beryl. Instantly it swept into motion, while Dalis\nwhirled to face the Sarkas, and from his lips came a burst of triumphant\nlaughter. One hand was on the Beryl Control, the other still held the\nRay Director.\n\n\"Fools!\" he cried. \"Fools! Duped like children! And now it is Dalis who\nis master of the world! Move closer to me, and I will turn my Ray\nDirector upon this Beryl, which you have so kindly informed me is master\nof all the Beryls and of all Ovidum deposits! Be glad that I do not turn\nit upon you; but for you I have a kinder, more honorable fate! I now am\nmaster, and will direct the destiny of the world! But I will never\nleave it, because I suspect that it is the most pleasant of all the\nworlds! I will, however, choose for the Sarkas a world that shall be the\ndreariest in all the Universe!\"\n\nThe Sarkas whirled as soft laughter came from Jaska, daughter of Cleric.\nStrange, lilting laughter. They turned in time to see her vanish through\nthe Exit Dome; but for a long moment her jeering laughter seemed to\nsound in the laboratory she had left-and, to judge by her laughter, had\nbetrayed! For Dalis, arch-traitor, echoed her laughter!\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n_The Beryls in Tune_\n\n\"Remember,\" said Dalis, as the Beryl began to revolve and its humming\nmounted moment by moment to normal, \"that you must concur in whatever I\nsay to the people of the Earth--for if you do not, I swear that I will\ndestroy this Master Beryl! Then what happens to your scheme, Sarka the\nThird? You see, there is no change in the plans, save one: I am the\nmaster, not you!\"\n\nDalis was not a madman, for the world conceded him place in its list of\ngeniuses next below the three Sarkas, which was high honor indeed; but\nDalis possessed in abundance that most universal of all human\nemotions--jealousy. For centuries he had been nursing it, watching the\nSarkas always in the niches just above him, yet never being able to\nattain to their eminence. Now....\n\nHe had outwitted them. It might be for a moment only, but while his\nmastery lasted he would drink deeply of personal satisfaction. Now,\nhowever, there was no gloating in his face, for he realized, as Sarka\nhad realized, the infinite gravity of the whole situation. If a mistake\nwere made, the world would plunge to destruction--or go cooling forever\nin a headlong race through space.\n\n\"I keep the Ray Director hidden,\" he whispered, while the murmuring of\nthe Master Beryl mounted as it gained speed again, \"but know you,\nSarkas, that its muzzle points at the Master Beryl, always!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow the forms of Earth were appearing on the Beryl. Men in countless\nhordes were maneuvering in myriads, legions and armies, across the face\nof the globe. There was no marching, but an effortless, swift as light\nalmost, aerial maneuvering. For each human being possessed the\ntight-fitting metalized cloth, with the gleaming helmet in whose\nskull-pan was the Anti-Gravitational Ovoid, which was the \"outside\"\ngarment of earthlings. With the Ovoid sitting exactly against the skull,\nman had but to will himself in any direction, at any livable height, and\nthe action took place. In the same way, one man, to whom others in an\norganization gave allegiance by appointment, could will all his\nunderlings into whatever formation he desired.\n\nAs beautiful and effortless at the flight of those birds which had\nvanished from the earth centuries before.\n\n\"Remember, Dalis,\" said Sarka, \"that while the speed of the Earth in its\norbit is between eighteen and nineteen miles per second, once thrown out\nof its orbit, and forced to follow a straight or nearly straight line,\nthe speed may be many times that-or much less!\"\n\n\"The simplest facts of science,\" snarled Dalis, \"were known to me a\nthousand years before you were born! Now I shall tell the Spokesmen of\nthe Gens, and be sure that you second what I say!\"\n\nHe paused. Then, raising his voice impressively, he spoke.\n\n\"O Spokesmen of the Gens, O Gens of Earth, hark ye to the words of Dalis\nand of Sarka! The time has come to try the experiment of which Sarka\ntold you, and which I, Dalis, of the Gens of Dalis, have found good, and\nhereby certify! See that all your Beryls are mathematically tuned to\ncatch every sound, every vibration, every picture, from this Beryl of\nSarka, henceforth to be known as the Master Beryl!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"No matter what happens, no matter what changes take place in the\ntemperature of your homes, no matter what storms may come, touch not\nyour Beryls until instructed from this laboratory! Tune your Beryls,\nthen leave them, and hasten faster with your preparations for war! Each\nSpokesman of a Gens will at once instruct the members of his Gens that\nall partitions between families shall immediately be removed, outward\nfrom a common center in each case, until one hundred families occupy a\nsingle dwelling place. Materials from destroyed partitions shall be\ncarefully hoarded, and the newer and bigger areas shall become\nmaneuvering places for the hundred families which will occupy each given\narea!\n\n\"Facing a crisis as we are, no thought can be given to privacy, and\nneighborly quarrels must be forgotten! This move is necessary because no\nsingle dwelling place is large enough to be used as a place of\nmaneuver--and from now on until the command is given, maneuvers must not\nbe held Outside! For hark ye, O Spokesmen, O Gens of Earth, we are about\nto start upon our voyage into outer space! Spokesmen, call in your\nmaneuvering myriads! You have five minutes!\"\n\nIn five minutes not a flying man could be seen in all the cold, stormy\noutside. Dalis spoke again.\n\n\"Tune your Beryls and remove partitions, taking care that in reducing\npartitions you so estimate your stresses and strains that the roof of\nthe world be not endangered by weight that is unsupported, or improperly\nsupported!\n\n\"Food Conservers, redouble your production and rush your transportation\nof Food Capsules!\n\n\"Mothers of men, take over the labors of your sons and your husbands!\nSisters and sweethearts of men, join the myriads in maneuvers, for you,\ntoo, may require knowledge of fighting!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn spite of himself, an ejaculation of admiration escaped the lips of\nSarka. Hearing it, Dalis turned to him, and a flush of pleasure tinged\nhis cheeks as Sarka shaped one word with his lips:\n\n\"Excellent!\"\n\nThen, after a pause, Sarka spoke directly to the Gens of Earth.\n\n\"Take heed of the words of Dalis, for they are also the words of the\nSarkas!\"\n\nThen an expression of surprise flashed across the face of Sarka as\nDalis' fingers began to move in a swift sort of pantomime--for the sign\nmanual he used was the secret manual of Jaska and Sarka! His heart cold\nwithin him at this new proof of her betrayal, Sarka nevertheless noted\nthe words which dropped silently off the fingers of this enemy of the\nSarkas.\n\n\"You are wise to resist no further! Together we can do much, and if you\ngive your word not to oppose me, we can work together; but I will be the\nmaster!\"\n\n\"But, if we grant you the mastery, will you heed our advice if it is\ngood?\"\n\n\"I will, but I alone will be the judge of its worth!\"\n\n\"Then we work together henceforth. Let us begin! In the time required to\nmove from here to the Moon, our people will have ample opportunity to\nperfect themselves in maneuvers! Are you ready, O my father, and\nfather's father?\"\n\n\"Ready!\" they said together.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut for a moment Dalis hesitated. \"Your word!\" he snapped, looking at\neach Sarka in turn, and each in his turn nodded. They had given their\nword, but not their love, to Dalis. Dalis bowed low to Sarka the\nYoungest, who darted to the onyx base in which revolved the Master\nBeryl, and pressed a small lever of metalized jade, set in a slot on the\nsouthern side of the base of onyx. The humming sound within the Beryl\nbecame perceptibly louder, and as the minutes passed, and Sarka stood,\narms folded, watching the Revolving Beryl, it continued to increase.\n\nHere was the crisis, and as they watched its sure, certain approach,\nthey forgot their enmities, Dalis and the Sarkas, and watched the\nwhirling Beryl. Minute by minute its humming increased. The figures\nstill were plain to be seen within the Beryl, but were becoming blurred\nof outline. Partitions had been removed all over the earth, increasing\nthe size of rooms a hundredfold, reducing their number a hundredfold.\nThe Gens of Earth, by hundred-families, were maneuvering under the Heads\nof Hundreds. The depths of the Master Beryl, therefore, was a maze of\nflying men, with their extremities slightly blurred, and becoming more\nso as the Master Beryl increased its speed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHere now was shown the value of the organization fostered by Sarka the\nFirst--for in all the world there was no single Beryl out of tune with\nthe Master Beryl; and as the Master Beryl increased the speed of its\nrevolving, so increased at the same time the speed of all the other\nBeryls. Minute by minute the humming of the Master, and with it the\nothers, increased in volume.\n\n\"Father!\" spoke Sarka. \"To the Observatory, behind the Beryl, please, to\nwatch the stars, and from them to note the direction we take when the\ncombined vibrations of the Beryls have affected the quiescence of\nEarth's deposits of Ovidum and, through its shifting, disturbed the\nflight of the Earth in its orbit!\"\n\nWith a brief nod Sarka's father hurried around the Master Beryl to the\ntiny Observatory beyond, from which, through the Micro-Telescopes, those\nwho knew could read the secrets of the planets, the stars--the Universe.\nSarka watched him go, wondering if Dalis might not forbid him. But Dalis\nmerely watched him go and said nothing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow that the time of Change was upon the world, Dalis realized his\nresponsibility. It was little wonder that he began to be for the first\ntime a little bit afraid.\n\n\"Note, Dalis!\" snapped Sarka, and Dalis started nervously as his name\nwas spoken. \"Feel the trembling of the laboratory, just as the same\ntrembling affects all the other buildings in the world in which Beryls\nare located. As the minutes pass the trembling will go deeper and\ndeeper, and by to-morrow the first tremors will be reaching into the\nEarth to several miles below the last habitable Inner Level! And\nthen....\n\n\"Then,\" repeated Sarka tersely, \"my father will know by his study of the\nstars in which new direction we are traveling! For within twenty-four\nhours the Earth will have started on its voyage of conquest!\"\n\n\"Is there no way, Sarka,\" queried Dalis, \"by which we can control the\ndirection of our flight!\"\n\n\"There _is_ a way, O wise and gallant Dalis! But since you do not know\nit, who now is master?\"\n\nDalis' face became as pale as chalk, and Sarka smiled a little as he\nwatched him. Then, wondering what new resolve stirred the depths of this\nmaster egotist of the earth, he watched emotions flash to and fro across\nthe face of Dalis, watched the color return to his cheeks. The cold of\ndeath gripped at his heart when Dalis spoke.\n\n\"I do not fear death, O wise and gallant Sarka!\" he mocked. \"For I have\nlived fully and well, and for many, many centuries! You know that I do\nnot fear to slay people of the Earth, for did I not propose to your\nfather's father that a flood would be beneficial to unfit earthlings?\nHear, then! Keep your secret, and I shall allow the Earth to go outward\ninto space, out of control, in whatever direction it will. If any other\nworlds happen to lie in our pathway....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDalis shrugged indifferently, turning his back on Sarka, to peer again\ninto the depths of the Master Beryl, whose voice had risen to a vaster\nmurmur, whose pictures were becoming moment by moment more blurred as\ntime fled irrevocably into eternity.\n\nSarka the First took advantage of his opportunity, and leaped at the\nback of Dalis, hands extended to fasten them in the throat of his\nancient enemy. Dalis whirled, with a burst of laughter, and the muzzle\nof his Ray Director covered the person of the First Sarka. In a flash\nthe spot where Sarka the First had been was vacant, and there was no\nsingle sign to show that he had ever stood there!\n\nSilence then in the laboratory, save for the mounting murmur of the\nMaster Beryl!\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n_Outer Space_\n\n\"He only proved a belief I have entertained for centuries!\" snarled\nDalis. \"That all the male Sarkas are fools--and the females for bearing\nthem!\"\n\nSarka said nothing, but within his breast a deep hatred was forming for\nDalis. He had disliked him before, and had been amused by him; but in\nthe busy life of Sarka there had been no time for hatred of anyone. Busy\npeople had no time for hatreds.\n\n\"You should be torn to pieces for that, Dalis!\" was all he said. \"We\nneeded my father's father in our efforts! But the loss to the world of\none super-genius cannot be balanced by slaying another--so you are safe!\n\n\"What he could do, I can do!\" snapped Dalis.\n\nSarka turned away from him, seating himself beside the table of the\nvari-colored lights, and his heart was heavy as lead in his breast. He\nblamed Jaska for much of this, and his heart was burdened, despite her\ntreachery, by the fact that he loved her, always would love her. Love\nwas the one possession which made centuries of life desirable to men of\nthe Earth. For men could spend centuries in seeking a true mate, knowing\nthat there were other centuries still in which to enjoy her. Woman was\nman's greatest boon, his excuse for living, as was man excuse for woman.\nThrough the centuries, when humankind remained forever young, the joy in\neach other of those truly mated grew as their knowledge grew....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd now Jaska had failed Sarka, when for half a century they had loved\neach other! Why had she done it? He had given her no reason to do so.\nHad there been some other reason? Why had she laughed, and left them,\nafter the betrayal of the Master Beryl into the hands of Dalis?\n\n\"Before God,\" whispered Sarka, \"I believe that you, Jaska, were playing\na game to dupe Dalis, as he played a game to dupe us!\"\n\nDown in his heart he was not sure. But somehow, just to whisper to\nhimself his faith in Jaska, gave it back to him in some measure, and by\nso much lightened the weight upon his heart. For now his\nresponsibilities were greater than they had ever been before, and he had\nneed of all his faculties.\n\n\"She'll come back, or somehow communicate with me, and explain\neverything,\" he told himself. But he refused to ponder on how Dalis the\nbetrayer had gained possession of the secret sign manual he had believed\nknown only to Jaska and himself. That, too, might be explained\nsatisfactorily, for Dalis was cunning.\n\nFrom the side of the laboratory opposite the Revolving Beryl came a soft\ntinkling sound, like the striking of a musical bell. Sarka rose wearily,\nstrode to the wall, where a narrow aperture opened, in which rested Food\nCapsules sufficient for one meal for three men. He smiled wryly. They\nknew then, the Food Conservers deep in the earth as they were, that\nSarka the First was no more--and sent food for three men! All the world\nknew, perhaps, yet no single person had raised voice in protest--or if\nany had, the mounting murmur of the Beryls had drowned it out.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Sarka!\" spoke Dalis suddenly. \"At what time do you estimate that the\nflight of the Earth in its orbit will be materially affected?\"\n\n\"It is being affected this moment, Dalis, shifting the Ovidum store!\"\nsaid Sarka shortly. \"Within twelve hours we will be in readiness to\nstart our journey!\"\n\nRemaining absolutely motionless within the domed laboratory, it was now\npossible to feel the ever so slight motion, not only of the laboratory,\nbut of the mountain crest upon which it rested. Not so much a to-and-fro\nmotion as a round-about motion.\n\nJust as the slightest sound flies outward through space endlessly, and\nthe slightest vibration moves outward until the end of time and of\nspace, Sarka knew that the vibration set up by the Beryl, slight though\nit was, was already being felt at the Poles of the Earth. Not enough to\nbe noticed there, but existant, just the same.\n\n\"In twelve hours the world will be fighting against this combined\nvibration and Anti-Gravitational Force we are starting, and second by\nsecond accelerating,\" Sarka explained to Dalis: \"fighting to remain on\nits pathway about the Sun! But we will win against it, and with each new\nvibration, each succeeding one being more strongly felt, we will force\nthe Earth that much more against the _pull_ which holds it in its\norbit!\"\n\nThe laboratory was trembling. The mountain beneath it was trembling.\nBoth in accordance with scientific design. There was no element of\nchance in it, for the mountain moved, and the laboratory on its crest\nmoved, as science willed. It was now difficult for Sarka to remain still\nwhere he sat, for the trembling was exciting his heart action, and\ncausing the blood to rush to his cheeks, making him feverish. He rose\nto his feet and began pacing the floor.\n\nHe strode to the jade lever, moved it ahead a fraction of a fraction of\nan inch, and perceptibly the murmuring of the Beryl increased, as did\nthe trembling of the laboratory and of the mountain.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwelve hours later exactly, Sarka shouted a single word to Dalis.\n\n\"Now!\"\n\nThe laboratory was swinging about in a sort of circle in a way that made\none dizzy if one remained still for the merest second. Sarka, glancing\nout into the Outside, across which blew the storms of the heights, and\nnoting that no cracks appeared in the surface of the world's vast roof,\nknew that this swaying motion had been transmitted evenly to all the\nEarth, and that, so far at least, his calculations had been correct.\n\nBut Dalis was in a cold sweat of fear, and deathly sick. The motion of\nthe laboratory, like the inside of a whirling top, made him ill, though\nSarka could tell that he fought against it with all his great will.\n\nSarka strode to him, looked him in the eyes for a moment. Dalis looked\nback, glaring defiance.\n\n\"Are you afraid, Dalis?\" he shouted, to be heard above the screaming of\nthe Master Beryl.\n\n\"I am not afraid,\" croaked Dalis. \"Has the time arrived?\"\n\nSarka paused, as though for dramatic effect, and raised his right hand\nhigh, while his left hand dropped to the metalized jade lever. There\nstill was room in the slot in the onyx base for the lever to move\nforward ever so little.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"We have reached the exact place,\" cried Sarka, \"where the Earth can, by\npressure upon this lever, be continued on in its orbit--or forced out of\nit--out into space! Which shall it be, Dalis? If I move the lever\nforward we start our voyage, and may not be able to return!\"\n\nFor a moment the nostrils of Dalis quivered as though with fear. His\nface was white with his illness; but out of his eyes peered the fanatic\nself-confidence of the man.\n\n\"Push it forward, O Sarka!\" he managed.\n\nSarka, smiling slightly, pushed the lever to its uttermost limit, still\nwith his right arm upraised. For full five minutes he stood thus, and\nthen....\n\n\"Now!\" he shouted, bringing down his arm. \"We have begun our journey\ninto space! Come, let us look Outside, and await the first reports from\nmy father!\"\n\nThe two men, forgetting again for a moment the fact of their enmity,\nstrode to the southern wall of the laboratory and looked out across the\nroof of the world.\n\n\"You will note, Dalis,\" said Sarka conversationally, \"that in a matter\nof hours, the roaring of the Etheric winds will possess everything! We\nwill have passed into the infinite reaches of Outer Space, where, if I\nmay make so bold as to say so, it were better if Dalis, self-named\nmaster of the world, knew whither he was going!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n_Moon Minions Prepare_\n\n\"It is time,\" said Sarka softly, \"that we who have urged the world to\nforget its quarrels should forget our own. What difference who is\nmaster, so long as success attend our efforts?\"\n\n\"Then tell me your secret of control of our flight!\" snapped Dalis.\n\nBefore Sarka could answer, however, Sarka the Second entered the\nlaboratory area before the Master Beryl. He looked a question at his\nson, and Sarka knew that his father was asking what had become of Sarka\nthe First. He shrugged his shoulders, and nodded his head toward Dalis.\nSarka the Second gave no more sign of perturbation than had his son, but\ndeep within his eyes were signal fires of fury which centuries of\npenance on the part of Dalis would not erase. But now, with Sarka the\nFirst gone, Dalis must live.\n\n\"We are headed,\" said Sarka's father softly, \"in the general direction\nof the Moon! If we could travel toward it in a straight line, we would\nreach it, if we kept our pace of about eighteen miles per second, in\napproximately four hours! But since we are out of control, I fear we\nwill pass it too far away for our fighters to fly across the intervening\nspace! Or we may be drawn against it, in planetary collision, which of\ncourse means annihilation. We are traveling noticeably faster than while\nin the earth's orbit. I am able to see something of the preparation of\nMoon-men to receive us!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDalis turned to Sarka, and the perspiration bedewed his forehead. In\norder to make this mad mission successful, he must know Sarka's secret\nof control. Had he been in Sarka's place, _he_ would have kept his\nsecret, no matter what happened, and he believed in his heart that Sarka\nwould do the same. It never occurred to him that Sarka, no matter who\nthe master, would divulge his secret in order to save humanity from\ndestruction.\n\n\"We have approximately four hours, Dalis!\" Sarka prompted the betrayer.\n\"I need at least an hour for my experiments! Do you, knowing as you do\nthat I have planned all this out, know exactly what course our voyage\nshould take, still insist on holding the reins yourself?\"\n\n\"I agree, for this time, to listen to your advice, as I promised you!\"\n\n\"Then let me suggest that you do some of the work which I had planned\nshould be done by my father's father! It is time that the world's\nInduction Conduits be placed in operation, in order that our people be\nsupplied with equable temperature from the Earth's Core, as our\ntemperature changes due to our position with relation to the sun! Stand\nback and give me the controls!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a moment Dalis stared at the two Sarkas. Would they seize power the\nmoment he moved away from the Beryl Control? In their places he knew he\nwould have done it. In their places he knew he would never have\nsubmerged self in the good of the people. But, somewhat diffidently, he\nmoved away. Sarka the Second returned to the Observatory, behind the\nBeryl, while Sarka stopped before the table where the lights were.\n\nAfter a moment of thought-conversation with Sarka the Second in the\nObservatory, he dimmed the light which connected his laboratory with the\nheadquarters of Klaser, in the Americas.\n\n\"Klaser,\" he barked, \"for the period of one second cut the speed of\nevery Beryl within your Gens to half its present speed!\"\n\n\"I obey, O Sarka!\" came the voice of Klaser.\n\n\"Have we changed direction?\" Sarka mentally questioned his father.\n\n\"Slightly, but we are curving away, instead of toward the Moon! Try\nagain!\"\n\nSarka dimmed the light of Cleric, who instantly made answer.\n\n\"I am here, Sarka!\"\n\n\"Stop the Beryls of your Gens for two seconds, but be prepared to speed\nthem up immediately afterward, if ordered, to the speed at which they\nare now revolving! Klaser, hold the speed of your Beryls as they are!\"\n\n\"I obey, O Sarka!\" came the musical tones of Cleric.\n\n\"I hear, O Sarka!\" replied Klaser.\n\n\"Now, my father,\" queried Sarka again, telepathically, \"what direction\ndo we travel?\"\n\n\"We are heading in a direction which will cause us to pass the Moon at a\ndistance of approximately fifty thousand miles!\"\n\n\"From which point our fighters can reach the Moon in exactly two hours,\nafter they have passed through our atmosphere!\" cried Sarka exultantly,\naloud.\n\n\"True, son!\" replied Sarka the Second, mentally. \"I suggest you hold\nour course steady as it is!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe motion of the earth now was as that of a steadily falling body, and\nthe shifting of the Ovidum store caused by vibrations set up by the\nBeryls had set the Earth on its course toward the Moon. Sarka now gave\ninstructions to Klaser and to Cleric to return the speed of the Beryls\nto that which they had attained at the moment the journey of the Earth\nhad begun--thus bringing them once more into harmony with the Master\nBeryl, and rendering the Ovidum static.\n\nDalis re-entered the laboratory from the Wall Tube, near the Dome Exit,\nby which he had passed down to the lowest Inner Level, and stared\nsuspiciously at the two Sarkas. He found them half-smiling their\nsatisfaction.\n\n\"We pass the Moon within fifty thousand miles!\" exulted Sarka. \"A flight\nof two hours for the Gens which attacks the Moon! Do you refuse, O\nDalis, to send your Gens against the Moon?\"\n\n\"Why not send the Gens of Gerd!\" demanded Dalis. \"He is the youngest of\nthe Spokesmen, and what better test is there for him than this?\"\n\n\"It is because he is so young that we do not wish to send him,\" replied\nSarka coldly. \"The colonization of the Moon by Earthlings requires the\nguiding genius of a Spokesman who has the experience of a Dalis--or a\nSarka, else you would now be dead!\"\n\n\"Then let it be a Sarka!\" barked Dalis.\n\n\"Who, then, will control the further flight of the Earth?\"\n\n\"You! Let your father lead my Gens against the Moon!\"\n\n\"What will your Gens say, O Dalis? That their revered Spokesman feared\nto lead them in person?\"\n\n\"Enough of this squabbling,\" snapped Sarka the Second. \"Do you not\nrealize that within a matter of hours, some Gens must be sent into\nbattle? Come with me to the Observatory, where you will be given\nsomething beside squabbling with which to occupy your minds!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLeaving the earth on its lonely flight through space, the three men\nhurried to the Observatory, where they seated themselves before the\neye-pieces of the Micro-Telescopes, whose outer circles had been aimed\nat the Moon.\n\nFor a moment the three stared breathlessly at the surface of this dead\nsister of the Earth. They noted her valleys, her craters which seemed\nbottomless, and saw that even as they watched, valleys and craters\nbecame sharper of outline, proving that they were approaching the Moon\nat a tremendous speed. It seemed, too, as though they were heading\ntoward sure collision, though Sarka the Second had said that they would\npass the Moon at a distance of fifty thousand miles.\n\n\"You will note activity at the very rims of the craters!\" said the Elder\nSarka easily. \"The craters are man-made, not volcanic, as some\nscientists believe, and are shaped to converge the rays of the sun, as\nour roof is created for the same purpose. But note the activity at the\nrims of the craters!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCloser the men peered, studying the rims as instructed by Sarka the\nSecond. All about them--and as they watched, activity became apparent on\nthe inner slopes of the craters--winged creatures seemed to be flying.\nThey looked like tiny oblate spheroids, and they were in swift action,\ndarting to and fro like bees which have been disturbed in their hives.\n\n\"Those spheres are of metal,\" said Sarka the Second, \"and they are the\nfighting Aircars of the Moon-men!\"\n\nNeither Dalis nor Sarka denied this statement, for they knew it to be\nfact. It became apparent that the movement of the Aircars was not a\nmovement of chance, but as skillfully ordered as any maneuvers which\nhad, during the last few hours, been executed by any of the Gens of\nEarth. That they were of metal became apparent when, through the\nMicro-Telescopes, the watchers caught the glint of the sun on the\nsurfaces of the cars.\n\nSarka did a swift mental calculation, and announced the result.\n\n\"Those Aircars average something like four hundred feet in length, and\nare doubtless filled with fighting Moon-men!\"\n\n\"That's right,\" said Dalis, who also had been calculating this very\nthing, \"but our Ray Directors will disintegrate the Aircars as easily as\nmy Ray Director disintegrated Sarka the First!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The remaining Sarkas received this statement in silence, for Dalis'\nchoice of a comparison had been an unhappy one, to say the least.\n\n\"I am wondering,\" said Sarka, \"if you, my father, and you Dalis, have\nnoted the peculiar appendages of the Aircars?\"\n\n\"I saw them some minutes ago,\" said his father moodily, \"and I am almost\nafraid to guess their use! If they are what I fear they are, then the\nMoon-men have been expecting this attack of ours for years and years,\nand have been preparing for it! If they have known, and have been\npreparing, then we are facing a race of super-Beings indeed--for we have\nknown but little of their activities!\"\n\n\"What, then,\" said Dalis, \"do you think is the purpose of those\nappendages?\"\n\n\"Those appendages, cilia, flagella, call them whatever you wish, are\nman-made tentacles, created for the purpose of seizing, crushing and\ndestroying--then discarding....\"\n\nFor a full two minutes the three men sat there, and horrible doubts\nflooded their brains. For the conclusion was obvious. The Gens of Earth\nwould go into action flying, not as organizations, inside an Aircar, but\nas individuals, in swarms, myriads, legions and hordes. In order to do\nthe utmost damage with their Ray Directors and Atom Disintegrators,\nthey must approach within a reasonable distance--and the picture of\nthose mighty tentacles, hurled like leashed lightning bolts into the\nmidst of the attackers, folding in individuals by scores and hundreds,\ncrushing them and dropping them contemptuously, was horrible in the\nextreme to contemplate!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was difficult to estimate the possible speed of the Aircars of the\nMoon-men, at least at this distance. Besides, perhaps not a single one\nof them was traveling at top speed, because of the fact of their crowded\ntraffic.\n\nThis thought passed through the minds of the three men.\n\n\"But we'll know,\" said Sarka dully, \"when they get into action. For if I\nam not mistaken, those Aircars are being mustered on the rims of those\ncraters to await orders, not to resist our attack, but to launch their\nown attack before we are ready! Dalis, are you going to allow your Gens\nto go into action against these Outsiders, without the inspiration of\nyour personal leadership?\"\n\nThe nostrils of Dalis were quivering with the intensity of his emotion.\nHis vast egotism told him that he, Dalis, could successfully combat\nthese Aircars of the Moon-men, and he wished with all his heart to issue\nthe orders to his Gens. But, vain as he was, he did not even wish to\nhave the appearance of acceding to the original plan of Sarka! Sarka had\nplanned for Dalis to attack the dwellers of the Moon, and Dalis had\nrefused. Now, when this challenge of the Aircars was a direct challenge\nto his genius as a potential warlord of earth and he wished to accept\nthe challenge, he was torn two ways.\n\nShould he go ahead under the common leadership of the Sarkas? Or should\nhe still refuse battle--and perhaps see some lesser Spokesman go forth\nto win glory and imperishable renown to himself?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA thought message, a command almost, impinged on the brains of the\nthree.\n\n\"I wish to speak with you aloud!\" The message was from Jaska!\n\nThe three men rose and darted into the room of the Master Beryl. They\nhad no sooner entered than the clear voice of Jaska sounded in the\nlaboratory.\n\n\"Sarka, I am no traitor! I am Jaska, who loves you! I am in the\nheadquarters of Dalis at Ohi, and the Gens of Dalis has indicated its\nallegiance to me, having been informed by me that it is the wish of\nDalis, whose presence is needed at the place of the Master Beryl!\nCommand us, O Sarka, for we are ready to attack!\"\n\nThere the voice ended, while the two Sarkas turned again to face Dalis.\n\nSarka now was glad that Dalis knew the secret sign manual, and his\nfingers worked swiftly as he spoke to the rebel.\n\n\"Will you, then, Dalis, allow your Gens to be led to glory by a woman? A\nwoman, moreover, who has duped you?\"\n\n\"The woman is a fool!\" said Dalis. \"She will lead the Gens to\ndestruction!\"\n\n\"Who, then, will be blamed if she does? Your Gens believe she is their\nnew Spokesman at your wish! If they are told otherwise, they will think\nthat Dalis himself is afraid to lead them!\"\n\n\"We shall see,\" said Dalis, \"if I could win honor by leading my Gens in\na successful attack against the Moon-men, how much greater will be my\nglory if Jaska attacks, is repulsed--and I go in to turn defeat into\nvictory!\"\n\nThus spake the colossal selfishness of Dalis, who took no thought of the\npossible, nay, certain, loss of countless lives because of his\nobstinancy.\n\n\"I suggest,\" he said, \"that you instruct your beloved Jaska to make\nready; for if I am not mistaken, when we return to the Observatory we\nwill discover that the Aircars of the Moon-men have left their craters\nand are racing outward from the Moon to meet us! Or perhaps you would\nlead my Gens, to safeguard Jaska!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n_The Attack of the Yellow Stars_\n\n\"Why should I safeguard Jaska?\" asked Sarka quietly. \"She is a true\ndaughter of Cleric! If Cleric does not fear for her to be Spokesman of a\nGens, why should I? He is her father. If she wins, the more glory will\nbe hers! If she loses, she will at least have tried!\"\n\n\"Meaning,\" snarled Dalis, \"that I have refused even to try!\"\n\nSarka shrugged expressively, and the three stepped once more into the\nObservatory, took their places before the Micro-Telescopes. For a moment\nthey could not see the outline of the Moon, for during their brief\nsojourn in the laboratory the Moon seemed to have disintegrated, flying\ninto countless spheroidal pieces.\n\n\"You see?\" said Dalis. \"The Moon-men do not wait for us! They attack!\"\n\nIt was all too true that the Aircars which had been mustered at the rims\nof the Moon's craters had been hurled outward into space, outward toward\nthe on-rushing Earth, and the myriad numbers of them for a time shut out\nall view of the surface of the Moon.\n\n\"God!\" spoke Sarka, and it was like a prayer. His cheeks were pale as\ndeath, for in a moment he would speak the word which would send the Gens\nof Dalis, under the leadership of Jaska, out against these formidable\nAircars of the Moon-men, and the appearance of the on-rushing cars was\nterrifying. That their flying radius, outward, was a great one, was\nmanifest by the fact that the Earth would not for another hour reach its\nclosest estimated point with the Moon.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSarka, exchanging glances with his father, rose and stepped again into\nthe laboratory. Even as he entered the room of the Master Beryl,\nJaska's broken signal came through.\n\n\"I am ready, Sarka!\" came her soft voice, vibrant with confidence. \"The\nGens is ready, and the Gens believes in me!\"\n\nFor a moment Sarka hesitated before taking the plunge. Then he spoke the\nfatal words.\n\n\"Go, Jaska, and my love goes with you!\"\n\nAs the Earth approached closer to the Moon, the revolving of the Beryls\nhad been decreased, so that the motion of the Master Beryl was almost\nnormal--normal being that speed with which it revolved when it was\nnecessary to use it for visual contact with the people of the Earth.\n\nOut of the area of the Gens of Dalis darted the green specks which were\nthe flying people of Dalis! Sarka, staring in among them, focussing the\nBeryl-microscope, sought for some way of identifying Jaska, who led\nthem. A thrill coursed through him when he made her out,\nunmistakably--dressed still in the tight white clothing of her own Gens,\nwith the Red Lily of the house of Cleric on her breast and on her back!\nThe daughter of Cleric was leading the Gens of Dalis into combat under\nher own colors and her father's insignia!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSarka raced back to the Observatory, seated himself again to watch the\nattack, which must of necessity be joined within a matter almost of\nminutes. Those myriads of Aircars flying outward from the Moon, had\nseemed invincible; but up until now he had never seen an entire Gens\nmustered at one time. His whole being thrilled with the awesome grandeur\nof the spectacle; it seemed that not an able-bodied individual of the\nGens of Dalis had failed to answer the muster of the Gens.\n\nMillions upon millions of people, taking off the icy roof of that part\nof the Earth lying between Ohi and the North Pole, from the heart of\nwhat had once been part of the Pacific Ocean.\n\nSo many of them were there that when they were free of the Earth,\nflashing outward at two thousand miles an hour, it was impossible to see\nthe Moon or those formidable Aircars--and still, out of the heart of the\narea of the Gens of Dalis, came other myriads, each flight waiting only\nfor the preceding flight to clear!\n\nThe green, tight fitting clothing of the Gens of Dalis, each individual\nwearing the yellow star of the Spokesman of the Gens! A marvelous,\nawe-inspiring sight!\n\nAnd this was but a single area, and the earth was divided into twelve\nsuch areas, some smaller, none larger, which showed Sarka for the first\ntime a hint of the mighty man-power, and fighting woman-power which he\ncontrolled. However, once free of the Earth, conduct of the fight would\nbe in the hands of the Spokesman--Jaska, acting for Dalis.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSarka turned to Dalis, his eyes flashing.\n\n\"Does it not thrill you, O Dalis?\" he demanded. \"Do you not wish now\nthat you had gone out with your people as their leader?\"\n\n\"They follow Jaska like sheep,\" he stated with a snort. \"But wait! My\nGens seem invincible, because it bulks between us and the Aircars of the\nMoon-Dwellers! Wait, see how the battle goes! The Gens may yet have need\nof Dalis!\"\n\nSarka studied those outgoing hosts, which were dwindling away to mere\nspecks with vast speed, for through the cordons and cordons of them he\ncould now see the Aircars more plainly. It was still possible, when one\nlooked through the Micro-Telescopes, to see the slim figure of Jaska\nleading the attack. She was in the vanguard of the Gens of Dalis leading\nher people onward as though she had been born to command--utterly\nfearless.\n\n\"And I was small enough,\" whispered Sarka, \"to doubt you! I even told\nyou that I doubted you! Forgive me, Jaska! Forgive me!\"\n\nAnd still, as Level after Level gave up its myriads, the Gens of Dalis\nshot forth from the Gens area, and winged away, following the lead of\nJaska. Millions of people, armed with Ray Directors and Atom\nDisintegrators. How tiny the individuals seemed, against the mighty bulk\nof those Aircars of the Moon!\n\nBut Sarka did not fear, save for the safety of Jaska, as he was\nrealizing anew that he had scarcely skimmed the surface of the man-might\nof the Earth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow, seen through the myriads of the Dalis Gens, he could see again the\non-rushing Aircars, and his heart misgave him for a moment as he could\ntell, by estimation, that at least a hundred families were outlined\nagainst each individual car, which moment by moment grew larger.\n\nThose tentacles were now much in evidence, rising and falling under and\naround the racing Aircars like serpents, or dragging ropes; but seeming\nlike living things in the sentient manner of their moving--eager to come\nin contact with the first of the earthlings, and to wrap those tentacles\nabout them, crush them, hurl them into space.\n\nSarka went back into the laboratory only long enough to attune the\nBeryls of the Earth to a point where the Earth would remain almost\nstationary, comparatively speaking, taking a curving course about the\nsurface of the Moon, as it had for countless millions of years coursed\nabout the Sun.\n\nThen, back to the Observatory, to see how went the battle. Through the\nMicro-Telescopes the first meeting was plain to be seen. The Gens of\nDalis rushed headlong to meet the Aircars and many of them rushed\nheadlong to their destruction.\n\nSarka noted a group of perhaps a hundred people break forth from the\nvanguard of the attackers, and mount to a safe height above the Aircars\nagainst which the Gens were hurling themselves. A sigh of relief escaped\nhim, and he wished there were some way in which he could learn the\nindividual identities of the ninety and nine who had taken Jaska\nforcibly out of danger! For her white clothing, and her Red Lily of\nCleric were plainly visible and recognizable! The men of the Gens of\nDalis might permit the leadership of a woman, but they would not permit\nher to be needlessly endangered.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSarka turned to Dalis, and noted that the face of the master egotist was\npale and drawn, his nostrils quivering with emotion, as he watched his\nGens go into battle, and a feeling of satisfaction coursed through Sarka\nlike a little white flame. Dalis was proud of his Gens, and now was\nwishing that he, and not Jaska, were leading them onward.\n\n\"I would wager something,\" whispered Sarka to himself, \"that Dalis will\nnot be able to stand it! That before battle has been joined for ten\nminutes, he will have gone out to take over the leadership of the Gens!\nJaska must have guessed that, too! Wise, clever Jaska!\"\n\nWith a fearless massing of forces, the people of the yellow stars joined\nbattle with the Aircars! The manner of men who flew the Aircars was\nstill unknown to the people of Earth.\n\nBut in a trice they would know.\n\nIn a matter of minutes Earth would realize the horror of what faced the\nGens of Dalis, whom Jaska led!\n\nFor with the sending out of their Aircars the Moon-men had given but the\nmerest hint of their ponderous, devastating might!\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n_Tentacles of Terror_\n\nDalis had always been a stormy petrel, but as he sat before his\nMicro-Telescope, watching his Gens go into battle against the Moon-men,\nnot even Sarka the Second guessed the depth of infamy of which Dalis\nwas capable.\n\nDalis had given a hint, but Sarka had, in his sudden realization of the\nfact that Jaska really loved him, and was no traitor, forgotten that\nhint. How had Dalis learned the secret sign-manual of Jaska and Sarka?\nTherein lay the hint.\n\nDalis, in common with all other Earth's scientists, possessed the\nability to think deeply, yet to so mask his thoughts that no one else\ncould grasp them telepathically--and it was well for the peace of mind\nof the Sarkas that they could not read the black thought of the man, or\nlook into the future, even so far as a dozen years.\n\nThe Gens of the yellow stars moved into contact with the Aircars of the\nMoon. Earth and Moon were gripped in the horror of war, the war between\nworlds, where no quarter might be asked or given, because fought between\nalien peoples who did not so much as comprehend each other's languages,\nor even their signals.\n\nThe people of the Gens swarmed about the Aircars like myriad swarms of\nangry bees, but it was only to Dalis that this simile came, for only\nDalis, of these three, had ever seen a swarm of bees.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSweeping in closely, the Gens brought forth from their resting places in\ntheir Sarka-Belts their Ray Directors and their Atom-Disintegrators, and\nturned the blighting rays of them against the gleaming, ice-colored\nsides of the aerial monsters.\n\nBut even as the Gens brought their instruments of destruction into play,\nthe mighty tentacles of the first hundred Aircars had got into action.\nDown they whirled to catch at the flying bodies of the pigmylike\nindividuals of the Gens, and hundreds of Earthlings were caught in those\ntentacles in the first moment of conflict.\n\nSarka studied the reaction of the people, thus captured. He could see\nthe expressions of unutterable agony on their faces, could see their\ncheeks turn black with--what? There was no way of knowing; but all sorts\nof guesses were possible. Those tentacles, from their action upon the\nhuman beings which they encompassed, might be charged with electricity.\nFor the people they captured turned black, then shriveled slowly--and\nwere released by the tentacles....\n\nThey fell sluggishly away, through the great space which yet separated\nthe Earth and the Moon. But the people who fell, fell aimlessly, going\nneither toward the Earth or the Moon, like black feathers in a vagrant\nbreeze.\n\n\"Great God, do you see father?\" cried Sarka. \"The--whatever it is--that\nturns our people into cinders and drops them, has no effect on the\nAnti-Gravitational Ovoids in the skull-pans of the helmets, and without\nmental direction, the Ovoids neither rise nor fall but wander aimlessly!\n\n\"See? As the fight continues, those who still live, as they dart here\nand there through the battle area, will be confronted continually by the\nblackened faces and shriveled figures of their departed friends,\nrelatives and neighbors, and will see at first hand what will happen to\nthemselves if they are caught by the tentacles!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom the lips of Dalis came one single burst of laughter, filled with\nbitterness. No other word came from his lips, no other sign. He merely\nsat and stared, and masked his hell-black thoughts so that neither of\nthe Sarkas might read them. But in the fertile mind of Dalis a plan was\nbeing born--a plan that, he knew, had always been growing back in his\nmental depths, somewhere, down the centuries, since first he had become\nan enemy of the Sarkas. The Sarkas ruled the Earth, and....\n\nBut he would spring his surprise when he believed the time right, for\nDalis possessed a faculty which neither of the Sarkas possessed--an\nexample of it being his incomprehensible knowledge of the secret code\nof moving fingers used by Sarka and Jaska.\n\nThe Gens of Dalis drew back in consternation at this wholesale taking\noff of the first line of attack. Out of that first line, comprising\nperhaps a thousand families, scarcely a hundred had escaped the groping\nof those mighty tentacles of the Aircars--and the black, shriveled\nthings which had been men floated all about the Aircars which had\ndestroyed them, warnings to those who followed them into the fray. Those\nwho had somehow escaped the wrath of the tentacles in the first\nengagement fled back into the heart of the next line of sky-skirmishers,\nfear and horror in their faces.\n\nHere, answering to the will of Jaska, a mile or so above the heart of\nthe conflict, they reformed with their people, and prepared again to\nattack. But how to attack these formidable Aircars successfully?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat was the question. Ray Directors had been turned against them, but\nsomething was decidedly wrong. The first car to feel the blast of even\none of those Ray Directors should have vanished, become as nothing, as\nhad the body of Sarka the First before the Ray Director of Dalis.\n\nBut apparently nothing had happened. Why?\n\nGrimly Dalis and the two remaining Sarkas pondered the problem,\nwondering at the same time what Jaska would now do, how reform her Gens,\nhow send it again to an attack that seemed hopeless.\n\n\"There they go again!\" whispered Sarka.\n\nThe first two myriads of the Gens of Dalis had now crowded together\nuntil they formed a veritable cloud which masked, for a moment, the\nAircars of the Moon. Then, as one person, answering to the will of\nJaska, they swept in to the attack again.\n\nBut as they approached the Aircars, they divided four ways--up, down,\nto right and to left, and smashed into the Aircars from four directions\nat once. Jaska, knowing that countless lives must be lost to destroy\nthese monsters of the Moon, was trying to down them by mass attack,\nhoping that, while the inner groups gave their lives, those who followed\nafter them would get in close enough to use their Ray Directors and Atom\nDisintegrators.\n\n\"She is wasting lives to no avail!\" cried Dalis. \"There is a way to beat\nthese people!\"\n\n\"It is really your responsibility, O Dalis!\" snapped Sarka. \"Why do you\nnot go out and lead your Gens? If you know, why remain here and watch\nthe destruction of all the people of your Gens?\"\n\n\"You know why our Ray Directors and Atom Disintegrators do not work, or\nwork but poorly? Because our fighters are within the gravitational pull\nof the Moon, instead of the Earth, and machines which work perfectly on\nEarth are thrown out of balance when under the influence of the Moon!\"\n\n\"Then,\" cried Sarka, \"we must sweep in close enough to our people....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWithout waiting to say another word, for thousands of men were dying\neach breath-space, Sarka raced into the laboratory and gave the signal\nto race up the speed of the Beryls, to attune them with the increasing\nspeed of the Master Beryl, whose jade lever now was set at the halfway\nmark in the onyx slot.\n\nWhen he returned to the Observatory, Dalis was gone, and Sarka the\nSecond sat alone.\n\n\"I knew he would go,\" said Sarka, \"for he cannot endure to see someone\nelse take credit for winning this first victory--if it is even possible\nto win it! I knew that, vain though he is, Dalis is yet a man!\"\n\n\"I am not so sure of that, son!\" replied the Elder Sarka. \"For I have\nknown him longer than you have! There's something else in that brain of\nhis which takes no thought of the death of people of his Gens--or for\nthe betterment of the other people of the Earth! I wonder....\"\n\nBut even as he spoke, Dalis was away, flying free and fast toward the\nscene of battle. In a few minutes his will would be felt by his Gens,\nand Jaska could return again. Sarka sought for her. She was still safe,\nhigh above the battle. Thousands and thousands of those shriveled things\nnow floated in the space about the cars, above them, below them,\neverywhere. But the Gens of Dalis had at last caused some trouble to the\nAircars of the Moon.\n\nA hundred of them, like stricken birds, were falling downward toward the\nMoon, great holes torn in their sides. But as they fell, their\ntentacles, which whipped here and there like snakes in their\ndeath-throes, carried with them their full capacity in people of the\nGens of Dalis!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith the partial destruction of the Aircars which were falling, the\nforce that actuated the death-dealing of those tentacles seemed to have\ngone out of them. For the people now held in the grip of the mighty\ntentacles were still alive! Their squirmings could be plainly seen, and\ntheir cries could have been heard, had it not been that the noise of\nbattle drowned out all other sounds.\n\nA hundred Aircars falling, and the men and fighting women of the Gens of\nDalis, with new courage in them now they realized that the Aircars were\nnot entirely invincible, renewed the attack with savage vigor.\n\nTaking no thought of the death which must surely come to them, they\ncircled and pressed the Aircars; and when the tentacles caught at some\nof them, others climbed to the very body of the Aircars, over the\nshriveling bodies of the dying, and turned their Ray Directors and Atom\nDisintegrators against the gray sides of the monsters.\n\nEven before Dalis had reached the vanguard of his Gens another hundred\nAircars were falling, each with its tentacles wrapped tightly about such\nof the earthlings as they could grasp. Falling ... falling ... still\nliving, plunging down.\n\nNow Dalis had reached the scene of the fray, and was assuming command.\n\nAs he did so a single white-robed figure, life-size when seen through\nthe Micro-Telescopes, darted out of the fray and headed at top speed for\nthe dwelling place of Sarka. Jaska, relieved, was returning home!\n\nBut though Jaska flew at top speed, she did not seem to grow larger, or\ndraw nearer to the Earth!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOut of the ruck of the defenders of the Moon, a single Aircar, whose\ngleaming gray side was marked with queer crimson splashes, broke free to\npursue Jaska!\n\nShe fled at top speed, yet the Aircar was gaining, proof that the Moon\nhad developed speed greater than Earth had attained.\n\n\"But why,\" queried Sarka, \"does she draw no nearer?\"\n\n\"Great God!\" ejaculated Sarka the Second, after a brief examination of\ncertain chartographs beside his Micro-Telescope. \"We are moving away\nfrom the Moon! Something is forcing us away! The people of the Moon have\nsomething whose nature we do not know, capable of forcing them away from\nus--while they pull our people toward them! You see? If they pulled us\ntoward them, we could overthrow them, for we outnumber them perhaps\nthousands to one; but if they force themselves away faster than the Gens\nof Dalis, if defeated, can follow us, they can destroy, or capture, the\nGens at their leisure!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuddenly, out of the Earth, past the all-seeing eyes of the\nMicro-Telescopes, swept a new myriad. Men in white, wearing the Red Lily\nof the House of Cleric! Cleric was sending out men to rescue Jaska from\nthe Aircar which pursued her! But would Jaska or these who went forth\nto fetch her ever be able again to attain landing place upon the Earth!\n\nIt looked doubtful.\n\nEven as Sarka asked himself this question fresh Aircars shot from the\nrims of Moon craters, rushing outward to add their weight in the battle\nagainst the Gens of Dalis. The Gens of Dalis was doomed!\n\nIn the mind of Sarka the Second there still loomed a hellish doubt that\nwould not down.\n\nThe men of Cleric were surrounding Jaska now, protecting her with their\nlives against the tentacles of that lone Aircar splashed with\ncrimson--and all were flying a losing race with the Earth, which was\nstill being forced outward from the Moon!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n  _IN THE NEXT ISSUE_\n\n\n  ON THE PLANET OF DREAD\n\n  _An Exciting Interplanetary Story_\n\n  By R.

He waved a long hand\ntoward the masses of yellow brown which filled the floor of the spacious\nworkrooms, towering almost to the skylights, high above their heads.\n\n[Sidenote: A giant amber block at last gives up its living, ravenous\nprey.]\n\n\"Is that coal in the biggest one with the dark center?\" asked an\nattractive young woman who stood beside the elder of the men.\n\n\"I am inclined to believe it will prove to be some sort of black\nliquid,\" said Marable, a big man of thirty-five.\n\nThere were other people about the immense rooms, the laboratories of the\nfamous Museum of Natural History. Light streamed in from the skylights\nand windows; fossils of all kinds, some immense in size, were\ndistributed about. Skilled specialists were chipping away at matrices\nother artists were reconstructing, doing a thousand things necessary to\nthe work.\n\nA hum of low talking, accompanied by the irregular tapping of chisels\non stone, came to their ears, though they took no heed of this, since\nthey worked here day after day, and it was but the usual sound of the\npaleontologists' laboratory.\n\nMarable threw back his blond head. He glanced again toward the dark\nhaired, blue eyed young woman, but when he caught her eye, he looked\naway and spoke to her father, Professor Young.\n\n\"I think that big one will turn out to be the largest single piece of\namber ever mined,\" he said. \"There were many difficulties in getting it\nout, for the workmen seemed afraid of it, did not want to handle it for\nsome silly reason or other.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nProfessor Young, curator, was an expert in his line, but young Marable\nhad charge of these particular fossil blocks, the amber being pure\nbecause it was mixed with lignite. The particular block which held the\ninterest of the three was a huge yellow brown mass of irregular shape.\nVaguely, through the outer shell of impure amber, could be seen the\nheart of ink. The chunk weighed many tons, and its crate had just been\nremoved by some workmen and was being taken away, piece by piece.\n\nThe three gazed at the immense mass, which filled the greater part of\none end of the laboratory and towered almost to the skylights. It was a\nsmall mountain, compared to the size of the room, and in this case the\nmountain had come to man.\n\n\"Miss Betty, I think we had better begin by drawing a rough sketch of\nthe block,\" said Marable.\n\nBetty Young, daughter of the curator, nodded. She was working as\nassistant and secretary to Marable.\n\n\"Well--what do you think of them?\"\n\nThe voice behind them caused them to turn, and they looked into the face\nof Andrew Leffler, the millionaire paleontologist, whose wealth and\ninterest in the museum had made it possible for the institution to\nacquire the amber.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLeffler, a keen, quick moving little man, whose chin was decorated with\na white Van Dyke beard, was very proud of the new acquisition.\n\n\"Everybody is talking about the big one,\" he continued, putting his hand\non Marable's shoulder. \"Orling is coming to see, and many others. As I\ntold you, the workmen who handled it feared the big one. There were\nrumors about some unknown devil which lay hidden in the inklike\nsubstance, caught there like the proverbial fly in the amber. Well, let\nus hope there is something good in there, something that will make worth\nwhile all our effort.\"\n\nLeffler wandered away, to speak to others who inspected the amber\nblocks.\n\n\"Superstition is curious, isn't it?\" said Marable. \"How can anyone think\nthat a fossil creature, penned in such a cell for thousands and\nthousands of years, could do any harm?\"\n\nProfessor Young shrugged. \"It is just as you say. Superstition is not\nreasonable. These amber blocks were mined in the Manchurian lignite\ndeposits by Chinese coolies under Japanese masters. They believe\nanything, the coolies. I remember working once with a crew of them that\nthought--\"\n\nThe professor stopped suddenly, for his daughter had uttered a little\ncry of alarm. He felt her hand upon his arm, and turned toward her.\n\n\"What is it, dear?\" he asked.\n\nShe was pointing toward the biggest amber block, and her eyes were wide\nopen and showed she had seen something, or imagined that she had seen\nsomething, that frightened her.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nProfessor Young followed the direction of her finger. He saw that she\nwas staring at the black heart of the amber block; but when he looked he\ncould see nothing but the vague, irregular outline of the inky\nsubstance.\n\n\"What is it, dear?\" asked Young again.\n\n\"I--I thought I saw it looking out, eyes that stared at us--\"\n\nThe girl broke off, laughed shortly, and added, \"I suppose it was Mr.\nLeffler's talking. There's nothing there now.\"\n\n\"Probably the Manchurian devil shows itself only to you,\" said her\nfather jokingly. \"Well, be careful, dear. If it takes a notion to jump\nout at you, call me and I'll exorcise it for you.\"\n\nBetty blushed and laughed again. She looked at Marable, expecting to see\na smile of derision on the young man's face, but his expression was\ngrave.\n\nThe light from above was diminishing; outside sounded the roar of\nhome-going traffic.\n\n\"Well, we must go home,\" said Professor Young. \"There's a hard and\ninteresting day ahead of us to-morrow, and I want to read Orling's new\nwork on matrices before we begin chipping at the amber.\"\n\nYoung turned on his heel and strode toward the locker at the end of the\nroom where he kept his coat and hat. Betty, about to follow him, was\naware of a hand on her arm, and she turned to find Marable staring at\nher.\n\n\"I saw them, too,\" he whispered. \"Could it have been just imagination?\nWas it some refraction of the light?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe girl paled. \"I--I don't know,\" she replied, in a low voice. \"I\nthought I saw two terrible eyes glaring at me from the inky heart. But\nwhen father laughed at me, I was ashamed of myself and thought it was\njust my fancy.\"\n\n\"The center is liquid, I'm sure,\" said Marable. \"We will find that out\nsoon enough, when we get started.\"\n\n\"Anyway, you must be careful, and so must father,\" declared the girl.\n\nShe looked at the block again, as it towered there above them, as though\nshe expected it to open and the monster of the coolies' imagination leap\nout.\n\n\"Come along, Betty,\" called her father.\n\nShe realized then that Marable was holding her hand. She pulled away and\nwent to join her father.\n\nIt was slow work, chipping away the matrix. Only a bit at a time could\nbe cut into, for they came upon many insects imbedded in the amber.\nThese small creatures proved intensely interesting to the\npaleontologists, for some were new to science and had to be carefully\npreserved for study later on.\n\nMarable and her father labored all day. Betty, aiding them, was\nobviously nervous. She kept begging her father to take care, and\nfinally, when he stopped work and asked her what ailed her, she could\nnot tell him.\n\n\"Be careful,\" she said, again and again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHer father realized that she was afraid of the amber block, and he poked\nfun at her ceaselessly. Marable said nothing.\n\n\"It's getting much softer, now the outside shell is pierced,\" said\nYoung, late in the day.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Marable, pausing in his work of chipping away a portion of\nmatrix. \"Soon we will strike the heart, and then we will find out\nwhether we are right about it being liquid. We must make some\npreparations for catching it, if it proves to be so.\"\n\nThe light was fading. Outside, it was cold, but the laboratories were\nwell heated by steam. Close by where they worked was a radiator, so that\nthey had been kept warm all day.\n\nMost of the workers in the room were making ready to leave. Young and\nMarable, loath to leave such interesting material, put down their\nchisels last of all. Throughout the day various scientific visitors had\ninterrupted them to inspect the immense amber block, and hear the\nhistory of it.\n\nAll day, Betty Young had stared fascinatedly at the inky center.\n\n\"I think it must have been imagination,\" she whispered to Marable, when\nYoung had gone to don his coat and hat. \"I saw nothing to-day.\"\n\n\"Nor did I,\" confessed Marable. \"But I thought I heard dull scrapings\ninside the block. My brain tells me I'm an imaginative fool, that\nnothing could be alive inside there, but just the same, I keep thinking\nabout those eyes we thought we saw. It shows how far the imagination\nwill take one.\"\n\n\"It's getting dark, Betty,\" said her father. \"Better not stay here in\nthe shadows or the devil will get you. I wonder if it will be Chinese or\nup-to-date American!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe girl laughed, said good night to Marable, and followed her father\nfrom the laboratory. As they crossed the threshold a stout, red-faced\nman in a gray uniform, a watchman's clock hanging at his side, raised\nhis hat and smiled at the young woman and her father.\n\n\"Hello, Rooney,\" cried Betty.\n\n\"How d'ye do, Miss Young! Stayin' late this evenin'?\"\n\n\"No, we're leaving now, Rooney. Good night.\"\n\n\"G' night, Miss Young. Sleep happy.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Rooney.\"\n\nThe old night watchman was a jolly fellow, and everybody liked him. He\nwas very fond of Betty, and the young woman always passed a pleasant\nword with him.\n\nRooney entered the room where the amber blocks were. The girl walked\nwith her father down the long corridor. She heard Marable's step behind\nthem.\n\n\"Wait for me a moment, father,\" she said.\n\nShe went back, smiling at Marable as she passed him, and entered the\ndoor, but remained in the portal and called to Rooney, who was down the\nlaboratory.\n\nHe came hurrying to her side at her nervous hail.\n\n\"What is it, ma'am?\" asked Rooney.\n\n\"You'll be careful, won't you, Rooney?\" she asked in a low voice.\n\n\"Oh, yes, ma'am. I'm always careful. Nobody can get in to harm anything\nwhile Rooney's about.\"\n\n\"I don't mean that. I want you to be careful yourself, when you're in\nthis room to-night.\"\n\n\"Why, miss, what is there to be wary of? Nothin' but some funny lookin'\nstones, far as I can see.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe young woman was embarrassed by her own impalpable fears, and she\ntook leave of Rooney and rejoined her father, determined to overcome\nthem and dismiss them from her mind.\n\nAll the way home and during their evening meal and afterwards, Professor\nYoung poked fun at Betty. She took it good-naturedly, and laughed to see\nher father in such fine humor. Professor Young was a widower, and Betty\nwas housekeeper in their flat; though a maid did the cooking for them\nand cleaned the rooms, the young woman planned the meals and saw to it\nthat everything was homelike for them.\n\nAfter a pleasant evening together, reading, and discussing the new\nadditions to the collection, they went to bed.\n\nBetty Young slept fitfully. She was harassed by dreams, dreams of huge\neyes that came closer and closer to her, that at last seemed to engulf\nher.\n\nShe awakened finally from a nap, and started up in her bed. The sun was\nup, but the clock on the bureau said it was only seven o'clock, too\nearly to arise for the day's work. But then the sound of the telephone\nbell ringing in the hall caused her to get up and don her slippers and\ndressing gown and hurry out into the living room.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBefore she reached the phone, however, she heard her father's voice\nanswering.\n\n\"Hello.... Yes, speaking. Good morning, Smythe.\"\n\nSmythe was the janitor of the museum. Betty, standing behind her father,\nwondered what he could want that he should phone so early in the\nmorning. Her father's next words sent a thrill of fright through her\nheart.\n\n\"My God! I--I can't believe it!\" cried Young. \"Is he dead?\"\n\nThere was a pause; Betty caught the sound of the excited Smythe's tones\nthrough the receiver.\n\n\"Who--who is it?\" she whispered, clasping her parent's arm.\n\n\"I'll be right down, yes.\"\n\nYoung hung up, turned to his daughter. His face was sad, heavily lined\nwith shadows of sorrow.\n\n\"Dear, there's been a tragedy at the museum during the night. Poor\nRooney has been murdered--at least so they believe--and Smythe, who\nfound him, wants me to come down and see if anything has been stolen. I\nmust go at once. The body is in our laboratory.\"\n\n\"Rooney? Ah, poor fellow.\"\n\nThe girl wept a little, but braced herself to assist her father.\n\n\"I'm going with you,\" she said.\n\n\"No, no. You'd better remain here: you can come along later,\" said\nYoung. \"I don't like to have you see such sights, dear. It wouldn't be\ngood for you.\"\n\n\"I'll be all right. I promise you I will.\"\n\nShe insisted and he was forced to let her accompany him to the museum.\nThey hailed a cab and were soon at the door. The elevator took them to\nthe top floor, and swiftly they passed along the corridors and came to\nthe portal which led into the rooms where the amber blocks were.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSmythe greeted them, a worried look on his seamed face. \"I've sent for\nan ambulance, Professor,\" he said.\n\nYoung nodded, brushed past him, and entered the laboratory. In the\nmorning light the amber blocks had taken on a reddish tinge. Now, they\nseemed to oppress the young woman, who had bravely remained at her\nfather's side as he walked quickly to the base of the biggest block.\n\nA vague shape lay in the shadows between the wall and the largest amber\nmass. Professor Young bent over the body of Rooney, and felt the pulse.\n\n\"He's been dead some time,\" he said.\n\nShe nodded, stricken to the heart by this terrible end of her old friend\nRooney.\n\n\"There's nothing we can do for him, now,\" went on her father soberly.\n\"It looks as though he had been set upon and stabbed time after time by\nhis assailant or assailants, whoever they were.\"\n\n\"How--how pale he is,\" said Betty. \"Poor Rooney was so jolly and\nred-faced, but his skin is like chalk.\"\n\n\"And he's shrunken, too. It seems there's no blood left in his veins,\"\nsaid her father.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMarable, who had been called also, came in then and aided in the\nexamination. He said good morning to Betty and her father, and then went\nto bend over Rooney's body.\n\n\"See the look of abject terror on his face,\" Betty heard Marable say to\nher father as the two examined the corpse. \"He must have been very much\nafraid of whoever killed him.\"\n\n\"They beat him up frightfully,\" said Young. \"There must have been\nseveral of the assassins; it would take more than one man to do such\ndamage.\"\n\n\"Yes. His ribs are crushed in--see, this gash, Professor, would be\nenough to cause death without any of the other wounds.\"\n\nBetty Young could not take her eyes from the ghastly sight. She steeled\nherself to bear it, and prayed for strength that she should not faint\nand cause her father trouble. She could see the two men examining a\nlarge blistered area under the corpse's armpit, in the center of which\nwas a sharp vertical slit which had without doubt punctured the artery\nnear the surface of the axilla. Perhaps it had pierced even to the\nheart.\n\n\"Bloodless,\" exclaimed Marable, noticing the same thing as her father\nhad spoken of. \"It is as if the blood had been pumped out of his body!\"\n\n\"Yes, I think it has drained out.\"\n\n\"There is not much of a pool here where he lies, though,\" said Marable,\nin a low voice. \"See, there are only splotches about, from various cuts\nhe received.\"\n\n\"Maybe he was dragged here from another room,\" said Young. \"When the\nothers come, we will soon know if anything is missing. It seems that men\ndesperate enough to commit such a murder would not leave without trying\nto get what they came after. Unless, of course, the killing of Rooney\nfrightened them away before they could get their booty.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSmythe approached the group, with a physician in tow. The latter\nconfirmed the facts which Marable and Young had found: that Rooney had\nbeen killed by the deep gash near the heart and that most of the blood\nwas drained from the body.\n\n\"They seem like the slashes from an extremely sharp and large razor,\"\nsaid the medical man.\n\nOthers were coming in to look at Rooney, and the museum was buzzing with\nactivity as various curators, alarmed about the safety of their valuable\ncollections, feverishly examined their charges.\n\n\"He punched his clock in here at two A.M.,\" said Smythe. \"I seen that.\nIt's the last time he'll ever do his duty, poor feller.\"\n\n\"Curious odor,\" said the doctor, sniffing. \"It smells like musk, but is\nfetid. I suppose it's some chemical you use.\"\n\n\"I noticed that, too,\" said Professor Young. \"I don't recognize it,\nmyself.\"\n\nMarable, who had been looking at the floor between the great block of\namber and the body, uttered an exclamation which caused the two men to\nlook up.\n\n\"There are wavy lines leading around back of the block,\" said Marable,\nin answer to their questions.\n\nThe young man disappeared behind the block, and then he called to them\nexcitedly to join him. Betty Young pressed closer, and finally slipped\npast the corpse and stood by her father.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBefore her, she saw a large pool of black liquid. It had been hidden by\nthe corner of the block, so that they had not noticed it, so busy were\nthey looking at Rooney.\n\nAnd there was a great cavity in the heart of the amber block. Pieces of\nthe yellow brown mass lay about, as though they had fallen off and\nallowed the inky substance to escape.\n\n\"It's hardened or dried out in the air,\" said Young.\n\n\"It looks like black lacquer,\" said Betty.\n\nThe musky smell was stronger here. The great amber block seemed to\nstifle them with its size.\n\n\"Our chipping and hammering and the heat of the radiator causing it to\nexpand must have forced out the sepia, or whatever it is,\" said Young.\nThere was a disappointed note in his voice \"I had hoped that inside the\nliquid we would discover a fossil of value,\" he went on.\n\nMarable looked at Betty Young. They stared at one another for some\nseconds, and both knew that the same thought had occurred to the other.\nThe frightful eyes--had they then been but figments of the imagination?\n\nMarable began looking around carefully, here and there. Betty realized\nwhat he was doing, and she was frightened. She went to his side. \"Oh, be\ncareful,\" she whispered.\n\n\"The giant block has been moved a little,\" he replied, looking into her\npretty face. \"Have you noticed that?\"\n\nNow that she was told to look, she could see the extremely heavy amber\nblock was no longer in the position it had been in. Marks on the floor\nshowed where it had been dragged or shifted from its original resting\nplace.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBetty Young gasped. What force could be so powerful that it could even\nbudge so many tons? A derrick had been used, and rollers placed under\nthe block when men had moved it.\n\nReason tried to assert itself. \"It--it must have exploded. That would\ncause it to shift,\" she said faintly.\n\nMarable shrugged. His examination was interrupted by the arrival of the\nmuseum's chemist, sent for by Young. The chemist took a sample of the\nblack liquid for analysis. Reports were coming in from all over the\nmuseum, different departments declaring, one after another, that nothing\nhad been disturbed or stolen from their sections.\n\nBetty Young went again to Marable's side. She followed the direction of\nhis eyes, and saw long, clawlike marks on the floor, radiating from the\nsepia.\n\n\"Doctor Marable,\" she said, \"please don't--don't look any longer. Leave\nthis terrible place for the day, anyway, until we see what happens in\nthe next twenty-four hours.\"\n\nHe smiled and shook his head. \"I must make a search,\" he replied. \"My\nbrain calls me a fool, but just the same, I'm worried.\"\n\n\"Do you really think ...?\"\n\nHe nodded, divining her thought. The girl shivered. She felt terror\nmounting to her heart, and the matter-of-fact attitudes of the others in\nthe great laboratory did not allay her fears.\n\nRooney's body was removed. The place was cleaned up by workmen, and\nMarable's search--if that was what his constant roving about the\nlaboratory could be called--ceased for a time. The chemist's report came\nin. The black liquid was some sort of animal secretion, melonotic\nprobably.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn spite of the fact that they had learned so many facts about the\nmurder, they as yet had not solved the mystery. Who had murdered Rooney,\nand why? And where had his blood gone to? In no other rooms could be\nfound any traces of a struggle.\n\n\"If you won't do anything else, please carry a gun,\" begged Betty of\nMarable. \"I'm going to try to take father home, right after lunch, if\nhe'll go. He's so stubborn. I can't make him take care. I've got to\nwatch him and stay beside him.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" replied Marable. \"I'll get a revolver. Not that I think it\nwould be of much use, if I did find--\" He broke off, and shrugged his\nbroad shoulders.\n\nLeffler came storming into the room. \"What's this I hear?\" he cried,\napproaching Marable. \"A watchman killed in the night? Carelessness, man,\ncarelessness! The authorities here are absurd! They hold priceless\ntreasures and allow thieves to enter and wreak their will. You, Marable,\nwhat's all this mean?\"\n\nLeffler was angry. Marable looked into his red face coolly. \"We do the\nbest we can, Mr. Leffler,\" he said. \"It is unlikely that anyone would\nwish to steal such a thing as that block of amber.\"\n\nHe waved toward the giant mass.\n\nLeffler made a gesture of impatience. \"It cost me many thousands of\ndollars,\" he cried.\n\n\"It is time for lunch, Professor,\" said Betty.\n\nMarable bowed to Leffler and left the millionaire sputtering away,\ninspecting the various specimens he had contributed.\n\nThe one o'clock gong had struck, and all the workers and investigators\nwere leaving in paleontological laboratories for a bite to eat.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMarable, with Betty, went out last. Leffler was over in one corner of\nthe room, hidden from their sight by a corner of an amber block. They\ncould hear Leffler still uttering complaints about the carelessness of\nthe men in charge of that section of the museum, and Marable smiled at\nBetty sadly.\n\n\"Poor Rooney,\" he said. \"Betty, I feel more or less responsible, in a\nway.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" cried the girl. \"How could you have foreseen such a thing?\"\n\nMarable shook his head. \"Those eyes, you know. I should have taken\nprecautions. But I had no idea it could burst from its prison so.\"\n\nFor the first time Marable had definitely mentioned his idea of what\nhad occurred. The girl had understood it all along, from their broken\nconversation and from the look in the young scientist's eyes.\n\nShe sighed deeply. \"You will get a revolver before you search further?\"\nshe said. \"I'm going to. Smythe has one, and I know he'll lend it to\nme.\"\n\n\"I will,\" he promised. \"You know, Leffler has the same idea we have, I\nthink. That's why he keeps talking about it being our fault. I believe\nhe has seen something, too. His talk about the devil inside the block\nwas half in earnest. I suppose he put it down to imagination, or perhaps\nhe did not think this fossil to be dangerous.\"\n\nThey went out together, and walked toward the restaurant they\nfrequented. Her father was there, lunching with one of the\nsuperintendents of the museum. He smiled and waved to Betty.\n\nEveryone, of course, was discussing the killing of Rooney.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter an hour, during which the two young people spoke little, Marable\nand Betty Young left the restaurant and started back toward the museum.\nHer father was still at his table.\n\nThey walked up the driveway entrance, and then Marable uttered an\nexclamation. \"Something's wrong,\" he said.\n\nThere was a small crowd of people collected on the steps. The outer\ndoors, instead of being open as usual, were closed and guards stood\npeering out.\n\nMarable and Betty were admitted, after they had pushed their way to the\ndoors.\n\n\"Museum's closed to the public, sir,\" replied a guard to Marable's\nquestion.\n\n\"Why?\" asked Marable.\n\n\"Somethin's happened up in the paleontological laboratories,\" answered\nthe guard. \"Dunno just what, but orders come to clear the rooms and not\nlet anybody in but members of the staff, sir.\"\n\nMarable hurried forward. Betty was at his heels. \"Please get yourself a\ngun,\" she said, clutching his arm and holding him back.\n\n\"All right. I'll borrow one from a guard.\"\n\nHe returned to the front doors, and came back, slipping a large pistol\ninto his side pocket.\n\n\"I want you to wait here,\" he said.\n\n\"No. I'm going with you.\"\n\n\"Please,\" he said. \"As your superior, I order you to remain downstairs.\"\n\nThe girl shrugged. She allowed him to climb the stairs to the first\nfloor, and then she hurried back in search of Smythe.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSmythe obtained a gun for her, and as she did not wish to wait for the\nslow elevator, she ran up the steps. Smythe could not tell her\ndefinitely what had occurred in the upper laboratory that had caused the\nmuseum to be closed for the day.\n\nHer heart beating swiftly, Betty Young hurried up the second flight of\nstairs to the third floor. A workman, whom the girl recognized as a\nmanual laborer in the paleontological rooms, came running down, passing\nher in full flight, a look of abject terror on his face.\n\n\"What is it?\" she cried.\n\nHe was so frightened he could not talk logically. \"There was a black\nfog--I saw a red snake with legs--\"\n\nShe waited for no more. A pang of fear for the safety of Marable shot\nthrough her heart, and she forced herself on to the top floor.\n\nUp there was a haze, faintly black, which filled the corridors. As Betty\nYoung drew closer to the door of the paleontological laboratories, the\nmist grew more opaque. It was as though a sooty fog permeated the air,\nand the girl could see it was pouring from the door of the laboratory in\nheavy coils. And her nostrils caught the strange odor of fetid musk.\n\nShe was greatly frightened; but she gripped the gun and pushed on.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen to her ears came the sound of a scream, the terrible scream of a\nmortally wounded man. Instinctively she knew it was not Marable, but she\nfeared for the young professor, and with an answering cry she rushed\ninto the smoky atmosphere of the outer laboratories.\n\n\"Walter!\" she called.\n\nBut evidently he did not hear her, for no reply came. Or was it that\nsomething had happened to him?\n\nShe paused on the threshold of the big room where were the amber blocks.\n\nAbout the vast floor space stood the numerous masses of stone and amber,\nsome covered with immense canvas shrouds which made them look like ghost\nhillocks in the dimness. Betty Young stood, gasping in fright, clutching\nthe pistol in her hand, trying to catch the sounds of men in that\nchamber of horror.\n\nShe heard, then, a faint whimpering, and then noises which she\nidentified in her mind as something being dragged along the marble\nflooring. A muffled scream, weak, reached her ears, and as she took a\nstep forward, silence came.\n\nShe listened longer, but now the sunlight coming through the window to\nmake murky patches in the opaque black fog was her chief sensation.\n\n\"Walter!\" she called.\n\n\"Go back, Betty, go back!\"\n\nThe mist seemed to muffle voices as well as obscure the vision. She\nadvanced farther into the laboratory, trying to locate Marable. Bravely\nthe girl pushed toward the biggest amber block. It was here that she\nfelt instinctively that she would find the source of danger.\n\n\"Leffler!\" she heard Marable say, almost at her elbow, and the young man\ngroaned. The girl came upon him, bending over something on the floor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe knelt beside him, gripping his arm. Now she could see the outline of\nLeffler's body at her feet. The wealthy collector was doubled up on the\nground, shrivelled as had been Rooney. His feet, moving as though by\nreflex action, patted the floor from time to time, making a curious\nclicking sound as the buttons of his gray spats struck the marble.\n\nBut it was obvious, even in the murky light, that Leffler was dead, that\nhe had been sucked dry of blood.\n\nBetty Young screamed. She could not help it. The black fog choked her\nand she gasped for breath. Leaving Marable, she ran toward the windows\nto throw them open.\n\nThe first one she tried was heavy, and she smashed the glass with the\nbutt of the gun. She broke several panes in two of the windows, and the\nmist rolled out from the laboratory.\n\nShe started to return to the side of Marable. He uttered a sudden shout,\nand she hurried back to where she had left him, stumbling over Leffler's\nbody, recoiling at this touch of death.\n\nMarable was not there, but she could hear him nearby.\n\nCool air was rushing in from the windows, and gradually the fog was\ndisappearing. Betty Young saw Marable now, standing nearby, staring at\nthe bulk of an amber block which was still covered by its canvas shroud.\nThough not as large as the prize exhibit, this block of amber was large\nand filled many yards of space.\n\n\"Betty, please go outside and call some of the men,\" begged Marable.\n\nBut he did not look at her, and she caught his fascinated stare.\nFollowing the direction of his gaze, the girl saw that a whisp of smoky\nmist was curling up from under the edge of the canvas cover.\n\n\"It is there,\" whispered Betty.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMarable had a knife which he had picked up from a bench, and with this\nhe began quietly to cut the canvas case of the block, keeping several\nfeet to each side of the spot where the fog showed from beneath the\nshroud.\n\nMarable cut swiftly and efficiently, though the cloth was heavy and he\nwas forced to climb up several feet on the block to make his work\neffective. The girl watched, fascinated with horror and curiosity.\n\nTo their ears came a curious, sucking sound, and once a vague tentacle\nform showed from the bottom of the canvas.\n\nAt last Marable seized the edge of the cut he had made and, with a\nviolent heave, sent the canvas flap flying over the big block.\n\nBetty Young screamed. At last she had a sight of the terrible creature\nwhich her imagination had painted in loathing and horror. A flash of\nbrilliant scarlet, dabbed with black patches, was her impression of the\nbeast. A head flat and reptilian, long, tubular, with movable nostrils\nand antennae at the end, framed two eyes which were familiar enough to\nher, for they were the orbs which had stared from the inside of the\namber block. She had dreamed of those eyes.\n\nBut the reptile moved like a flash of red light, though she knew its\nbulk was great; it sprayed forth black mist from the appendages at the\nend of its nose, and the crumpling of canvas reached her ears as the\nbeast endeavored to conceal itself on the opposite side of the block.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMarable had run to the other side of the mass. The air, rushing in from\nthe windows, had cleared the mist, in spite of the new clouds the\ncreature had emitted, and Betty could see for some feet in either\ndirection now.\n\nShe walked, with stiff, frozen muscles, around to join Marable. As she\ncame near to him, she saw him jerking off the entire canvas cover of the\nblock to expose the horrible reptile to the light of day.\n\nAnd now the two stood staring at the awful sight. The creature had\nflattened itself into the crevices and irregular surfaces of the block,\nbut it was too large to hide in anything but a huge space. They saw\nbefore them its great bulk, bright red skin blotched with black, which\nrose and fell with the breathing of the reptile. Its long, powerful\ntail, tapering off from the fat, loathsome body, was curled around the\nbottom of the block.\n\n\"That's where it's been hidden, under the shroud. We've been within a\nfew feet of it every moment we've been at work,\" said Marable, his voice\ndry. \"There were many hiding places for it, but it chose the best. It\ncame out only when there was comparative quiet, to get its food....\"\n\n\"We--we must kill it,\" stammered the girl.\n\nBut she could not move. She was looking at the immense, cruel, lidless\neyes, which balefully held her as a serpent paralyzes a bird. The\ntubular nostrils and antennae seemed to be sniffing at them, waving to\nand fro.\n\n\"See the white expanse of cornea, how large it is,\" whispered Marable.\n\"The pupils are nothing but black slits now.\" The interest excited by\nthis living fossil was almost enough to stifle the dread of the creature\nin the man.\n\nBut the girl saw the huge flat head and the crinkled tissue of the\nfrilled mouth with its sucker disks.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuddenly, from the central portion of the sucker-cup mouth issued a\nlong, straight red fang.\n\nThe two drew back as the living fossil raised a short clawed leg.\n\n\"It has the thick body of an immense python and the clawed legs of a\ndinosaur,\" said Marable, speaking as though he were delivering a\nlecture. The sight, without doubt, fascinated him as a scientist. He\nalmost forgot the danger.\n\n\"Oh, it's horrible,\" whispered the girl.\n\nShe clung to his arm. He went on talking. \"It is some sort of\nterrestrial octopus....\"\n\nTo the girl, it seemed that the living fossil was endless in length.\nCoil after coil showed as the ripples passed along its body and the\nstraight fang threatened them with destruction.\n\n\"See, it is armored,\" said Marable.\n\n\"Betty, no one has ever had such an experience as this, seen such a\nsight, and lived to tell of it. It must be ravenous with hunger, shut up\nin its amber cell inside the black fluid. I--\"\n\nA sharp, whistling hiss interrupted his speech. The reptile was puffing\nand swelling, and as it grew in bulk with the intake of the air, its\nenamel-like scales stood out like bosses on the great body. It spat\nforth a cloud of black, oily mist, and Marable came to himself at last.\n\nHe raised his revolver and fired at the creature, sending shot after\nshot from the heavy revolver into the head.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBetty Young screamed as the reptile reared up and made a movement toward\nthem. Marable and the girl retreated swiftly, as the beast thumped to\nthe floor with a thud and started at them, advancing with a queer,\ncrawling movement.\n\nIt was between them and the door. Betty thrust her gun into Marable's\nhands, for his own was empty and he had hurled it at the monster.\n\n\"Hurry! Run for your life!\" ordered Marable, placing himself between\nBetty and the reptile.\n\nShe would not leave him till he swerved to one side, going dangerously\nclose to the beast and firing into its head. The rush of the flowing\nbody stopped; it turned and pursued him, leaving the girl safe for the\nmoment, but separated from Marable.\n\nLuckily, on the smooth marble it could not get an efficient grip with\nits clawlike arms. It was clumsy in its gait, and for a time the man\neluded it.\n\nBetty Young, looking about for a weapon, calling for help at the top of\nher lungs, caught sight of a fireman's ax in a glass case on the wall.\nShe ran over, smashed the glass with the small hammer, and took out the\nheavy ax.\n\nShot after shot reverberated through the big laboratory as Marable tried\nto stop the monster. Betty, bravely closing in from the rear, saw\nMarable leaping from side to side as the brute struck viciously at him\ntime and again.\n\nThe creature had been emitting cloud after cloud of black fog, and the\natmosphere, in spite of the open windows, was dim in its vicinity.\nVaguely Betty heard shouts from the far hall, but all she could do was\nto call out in return and run toward the horror.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMarable, out of breath, had climbed to the top of an amber block. Betty,\nclose by, saw the reptile rear its bulk up into the air, until it was\nhigh enough to strike the man.\n\nBefore it could send forth its death-dealing fang to pin Marable to the\nblock, however, Betty Young brought the ax down on its back with all her\nstrength.\n\nThere was a sickening thud as the sharp weapon sunk deep into the fleshy\nback. She struck again, and the creature fell in folds, like a\ncollapsing spring. It lashed back at her, but she leaped clear as it\nslashed in agony, thrashing about so that the whole room seemed to rock.\n\nMarable came scrambling down the side of the block to help her. He was\nbreathing hard, and she turned toward him; as Betty looked away, a\nportion of the scarlet tail hit her in the body and she fell, striking\nher head on the floor.\n\nMarable reached down, seized the ax, and in a desperate frenzy hacked at\nthe reptile's awful head. He leaped in and out like a terrier, sinking\nthe ax deep into the neck and head of the beast. He gave the impression\nof slashing at heavy rubber, and Betty Young, trying to drag herself\naway from that dangerous body, heard his whistling breath.\n\nThey were almost hidden from one another now, in the mist which came\nfrom the thing's nostrils.\n\n\"Help, help!\" screamed the girl, mustering her last strength in the\ndespairing cry.\n\nShe saw Marable go down, then, as the reptile hit him a glancing blow\nwith its body. When the powerful young fellow did not rise, the girl\nthought it was all over. The air really became black to her; she fainted\nand lay still.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Betty Young opened her eyes, the air had cleared greatly, and she\ncould see the familiar outlines of the paleontological laboratory and\nthe bulks of the amber blocks. Her father was holding her head in his\nlap, and was bathing her temples with water.\n\n\"Darling,\" he said, \"are you badly hurt?\"\n\n\"No,\" she murmured faintly. \"I'm--I'm all right. But--but Walter--did\nit--\"\n\n\"He's all right,\" said her father. \"The reptile was dying, and could do\nhim no damage. We finished it off.\"\n\nThen, Marable, covered with blood, which he was trying to wipe from his\nhands and clothes, came and smiled down at her.\n\n\"Well,\" said Professor Young, \"you two have mutilated a marvelous and\nunique specimen between you.\"\n\nThere were several men examining something nearby. Turning her eyes in\ntheir direction, Betty saw they were viewing the remains of the reptile.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMarable helped her to her feet, and stood with one arm about her.\nProfessor Orling, the famous specialist on fossil reptiles, was speaking\nnow, and the others listened.\n\n\"I think we will find it to be some sort of missing link between the\ndinosaurs and mososaurs. It is surely unbelievable that such a creature\nshould be found alive; but perhaps it can be explained. It is related to\nthe amphibians and was able to live in or out of the water. Now, we have\nmany instances of reptiles such as lizards and toads penned up in solid\nrock but surviving for hundreds of years. Evidently this great reptile\nwent through the same sort of experience. I would say that there has\nbeen some great upheaval of nature, that the reptile was caught in its\nprison of amber thousands and thousands of years ago. Through\nhibernation and perhaps a preservative drug it emitted in the black\nfluid, this creature has been able to survive its long imprisonment.\nNaturally, when it was released by the cutting away of part of the amber\nwhich penned it in, it burst its cell, ravenous with hunger. The\nfanglike tooth we see was its main weapon of attack, and it set upon the\nunfortunate watchman. After knocking him unconscious, its sucker-like\nfringe glued the mouth near the heart while the fang shot into the\narteries and drew forth the body fluids. There is a great deal to be\ndone with this valuable find, gentlemen. I would suggest that--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMarable grunted. \"Oh, hell,\" he murmured in Betty Young's ear. \"To the\ndevil with paleontology, Betty. You saved my life. Come out and let's\nget married. I love you.\"\n\nThe girl smiled up into his eyes. The scientists close by were listening\nfascinatedly to Orling's words, and had no time to watch the two young\npeople, for they stared at the reptile's body as the great man went from\nsection to section, lecturing upon one point after another.\n\n\"You've forgotten paleontology for a moment, thank goodness,\" said\nBetty. \"I'm glad.\"\n\n\"Yes, Betty dear. This terrible experience has shaken me, and I realized\nhow much I love you when I saw you in danger. What an awful few minutes!\nIf I had to live them over again, I don't think I could face them.\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" she murmured. \"We are safe, Walter. After all, it's not\nevery woman who is helped by a living fossil to make the man she loves\nrealize he loves her!\"\n\n[Illustration: The SF-22 and her convoy were surrounded by these\nunearthly rays.]\n\n\n\n\nThe Terror of Air-Level Six\n\n_By Harl Vincent_\n\n\nIt was a sweltering evening in mid-August, during that unprecedented\nheat wave which broke Weather Bureau records in 2011. New York City had\nsimmered under a blazing sun for more than three weeks, and all who were\nable had deserted the city for spots of lesser torridity. But I was one\nof those unfortunates who could not leave on account of the pressing\nurgency of business matters and, there being nothing else to do, kept\ndoggedly at my work until it seemed that nerves and body must soon give\nway under the strain. To-night, as I boarded the pneumatic tube, I\ndropped into the nearest seat and could not even summon the energy to\nopen my newspaper.\n\n[Sidenote: From some far reach of leagueless Space\ncame a great pillar of flame to lay waste\nand terrorize the Earth.]\n\nFor some minutes I sat as in a daze, wishing merely that the journey was\nover, and that I was on my own front porch out in Rutherford. After\nawhile I stirred and looked around. Seeing none of my acquaintances in\nthe car, I finally opened the newspaper and was considerably startled by\nthe screaming headlines that confronted me from its usually conservative\nfirst page:\n\n  SECOND COAST TRANSPORT\n  PLANE LOST!\n\n  Disaster Like First in Air-Level\n  Six!\n\nNo wonder the newsboys had been crying an extra on Broadway! I had given\nno heed to the import of their shoutings, but this was real news and\nwell worthy of an extra edition. Since the mysterious loss of the SF-61,\nonly four days previously, the facilities of the several air\ntransportation systems were seriously handicapped on account of the\nshaken confidence of the general public. It was not surprising that\nthere was widespread reluctance at trusting human lives and valuable\nmerchandise to the mercies of the inexplicable power which had\napparently wiped out of existence the SF-61, together with its\ntwenty-eight passengers and the consignment of one-half million dollars\nin gold. And now the NY-18 had gone the way of the other!\n\nDetails were meager. Both ships had failed to reply to the regular\nten-minute radio calls from headquarters and had not since been seen or\nheard from. In both cases the last call had been answered when the ship\nwas proceeding at full speed on its regular course in air-level six. The\nSF-61 last reported from a position over Mora in New Mexico, and four\ndays of intensive search by thousands of planes had failed to locate\nship or passengers. To-day, in the early hours of the morning, the NY-18\nreported over Colorado Springs, on the northern route, and then, like\nthe SF-61, dropped out of existence insofar as any attempts at\ncommunicating with or locating her were concerned. She, too, carried a\nheavy consignment of specie, though only eleven passengers had risked\nthe westward journey.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSomeone had dropped into a seat at my side, and I looked up from my\nreading to meet the solemn eyes of Hartley Jones, a young friend whom I\nhad not seen for several months.\n\n\"Why, hello, Hart,\" I greeted him. \"Glad to see you, old man. Where in\nSam Hill have you been keeping yourself?\"\n\n\"Glad to see you, too, Jack,\" he returned warmly. \"Been spending most of\nmy time out at the hangar.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's right. You fellows built a new one at Newark Airport, didn't\nyou?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Got a great outfit there now, too. Why don't you drop around and\nsee us one of these days?\"\n\n\"I will, Hart, and I want you to take me up some time. You know I have\nnever been in one of these new ships of yours. But what do you think of\nthis mess?\" I pointed to the black headlines.\n\nHe grinned joyously and flipped back the lapel of his coat, displaying a\nnickeled badge. \"George and I are starting out to-night to look around a\nlittle,\" he gloated. \"Just been appointed deputy air commissioners; and\nwe got a couple of guns on our newest plane. Air Traffic Bureau thinks\nthere's dirty work afoot. Twelve-motored planes don't disappear without\nleaving a trace. Anyhow, we've got a job, and we're going to try and\nfind out what's wrong. How'd you like to come along?\"\n\n\"What?\" I replied. \"You know darn well I'm too busy. Besides, I'd be no\ngood to you. Just extra load, and not pay load at that. And then, I'm\nbroke--as usual.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHartley Jones grinned in his engaging way. \"You'd be good company,\" he\nparried; \"and, what's more, I think the trip would do you a lot of good.\nYou look all shot to pieces.\"\n\n\"Forget it,\" I laughed. \"It's just the heat. And I'll have to leave you\nhere, Hart. Drop in and see us, will you? The wife was asking for you\nonly yesterday.\"\n\n\"Jack, dear,\" my wife greeted me at the door of my modest suburban home,\n\"Mr. Preston just called, and he wants you to call him right back.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lord,\" I groaned, \"can't I forget the office for one evening?\"\nPreston was manager of the concern for which I worked.\n\nNevertheless, though our two fine youngsters were clamoring for their\ndinner, I made the telephone call at once.\n\n\"Makely,\" came the voice of the boss, when the connection was completed,\n\"I want you to take the night plane for Frisco. Hate to ask you, but it\nmust be done. Townley is sick and someone has to take those Canadian Ex.\nbonds out to Farnsworth. You're the only one to do it, and after you get\nthere, you can start on that vacation you need. Take a month if you\nwish.\"\n\nThe thought of Hartley Jones' offer flashed through my mind. \"But have\nyou read of the loss of the NY-18?\" I asked Preston.\n\n\"I have, Makely. There'll be another hundred a month in your check, too,\nto make up for the worry of your family. But the government is sending\nthirty Secret Service men along on the SF-22, which leaves to-night. In\naddition, there will be a convoy of seven fighting planes, so there is\nnot likely to be a repetition of the previous disasters.\"\n\nThat hundred a month sounded mighty good, for expenses had been mounting\nrapidly of late. \"All right, Mr. Preston,\" I agreed. \"I will be at the\nairport before midnight. But how about the bonds?\"\n\n\"I'll drive around after dinner and deliver them to you. And thanks for\nyour willingness, Makely. You'll not be sorry.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy wife had listened intently and, from my words, she knew what to\nexpect. Her face was a tragic mask when I replaced the receiver on its\nhook, and my heart sank at her expression.\n\nThen there came the ring of the telephone and, for some reason, my pulse\nraced as I went to the hall to answer it. Hartley Jones' cheerful voice\ngreeted me and he was positively gleeful when I told him of my\nprojected trip.\n\n\"Hooray!\" he shouted. \"But you'll not take the SF-22. You'll take the\ntrip with me as I wanted. I tell you what: You be out at Newark Airport\nat eleven-thirty, but come to my hangar instead of to that of the\ntransportation company. We'll leave at the same time as the regular\nliner, and we'll get your old bonds to Frisco, regardless of what might\nhappen to the big ship. Also we might learn something mighty\ninteresting.\"\n\nI argued with him, but to no avail. And the more I argued, the greater\nappeal was presented by his proposition. Finally there was nothing to do\nbut agree.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPreston arrived with the bonds shortly after the children were tucked in\ntheir beds. I did not tell him of my change in plans. He did not stay\nlong, and I could see that he was uncomfortable under the accusing eyes\nof Marie, for all his own confidence in the safety of the trip in the\nclosely-guarded SF-22.\n\nAt precisely eleven-thirty I reached the great steel and glass hangar\nwhere Hart Jones and George Boehm carried on their experiments with\nsuper-modern types of aircraft. Hart Jones had inherited more than two\nmillion dollars, and was in a fair way to spend it all on his favorite\nhobby, though those who knew him best vowed that he would make many\ntimes that amount through royalties on his ever-growing number of\nvaluable inventions.\n\nThe immense doors were open, and I gazed for the first time into the\nhangar whose spacious interior provided storage and manufacturing\nfacilities for a dozen or more planes of Hart Jones' design. A curiously\nconstructed example of his handiwork stood directly before me, and\nseveral mechanics were engaged in making it ready for flight. My friend\nadvanced from their midst to meet me, a broad smile on his grease\nsmeared countenance.\n\n\"Greetings, Jack,\" he said, taking my small bag from my hands. \"Right on\ntime, I see. And I can't tell you how glad I am that you are coming with\nus. So is George.\"\n\n\"Well, I didn't expect to,\" I admitted; \"but there is no need of telling\nyou that I had far rather be in your ship than in the big one.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGeorge Boehm, the same jolly chap I had several times met in Hart's\ncompany, but fatter than ever, crawled from beneath the shiny metal body\nof the plane and scrambled to his feet at my side.\n\n\"Going in for a bit of adventuring, Mr. Makely?\" he asked, wiping his\nhand with a piece of cotton waste before extending it.\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied, as I squeezed his chubby fingers. \"Can't stick in the\nmud all my life, George. And I wouldn't want to be in better company for\nmy first attempt either.\"\n\n\"Nor we,\" he returned, a mischievous twinkle in his eyes. \"Rather have a\ngreenhorn on the Pioneer than some government agent, who'd be butting in\nand trying to run everything. Think you'll be scared?\"\n\n\"Probably,\" I admitted; \"but I guess I can stand it.\"\n\n\"Hear the latest news broadcast?\" interrupted Hart Jones.\n\n\"No. What was it?\" I asked.\n\n\"There has been a report from out near Cripple Creek,\" said Hart\nsolemnly, \"that a pillar of fire was observed in the mountains shortly\nafter the time the NY-18 last reported. The time and the location\ncoincide with her probable position and the report was confirmed by no\nless than three of the natives of that locality. Of course the\nstatements are probably extravagant, but they claim this pillar of fire\nextended for miles into the heavens and was accompanied by a tremendous\nroaring sound that ceased abruptly as the light of the flame\ndisappeared, leaving nothing but blackness and awe-inspiring silence\nbehind.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Lot of bunk!\" grunted George, who was vigorously scrubbing the back of\nhis neck.\n\n\"Sounds like a fairy tale,\" I commented.\n\n\"Nevertheless, there may be something in it. In fact, there must be.\nThree of these mountaineers observed practically the same phenomenon\nfrom quite widely separated points, though one of them said there were\nthree pillars of fire and that these looked more like the beams of\npowerful search-lights. All agreed on the terrific roar. And, after all,\nthese two liners did disappear. There must be something quite out of the\nordinary about the way in which they were captured or destroyed, and\nthis occurrence may well be supposed to have a bearing on the matter.\"\n\n\"Possibly they were destroyed by some freak electrical storm,\" I\nsuggested.\n\n\"Where then are the wrecked vessels?\" asked Hart. \"No, Jack, electrical\nstorms do not destroy huge air liners and then suck them out into space\nbeyond our vision. These two ships are no longer on the surface of the\nearth, else they would have been long since located. The magnetic\ndirection finders of the transportation people have covered every inch\nof the United States, as well as Mexico and Canada.\"\n\n\"Of course they might have been carried halfway around the world by a\nwind of unprecedented velocity.\" I commenced a silly argument in favor\nof the theory that the elements had accounted for the two vessels, but\nwas interrupted by the mounting roar of great engines throbbing\noverhead.\n\n\"Hurry up there, George!\" shouted Hart. \"It's the SF-22 coming in. We\nhave to be ready for the take-off in five minutes!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe hastened to take George's place at the washbowl and all was activity\nwithin the confines of our hangar. George and I left the office and went\nout to the landing field, which was now brilliant with the glare of\nfloodlights. The _Pioneer_ had been trundled into the open and stood\nready for the flight. Not a hundred feet above the field, the huge\nsilver moth that was the SF-22 swept by in a wide circle that would\nbring her into the wind. The roar of her engines died as she swung out\nof the circle of light into the surrounding darkness.\n\nThe crowds which had gathered to witness her landing buzzed with excited\ncomment and speculation. Her nose brought slightly up, she dropped to a\nperfect three-point landing, the brakes screeching as she was brought to\na standstill at the hangar of the transportation company.\n\n\"Come on now, you fellows,\" came the voice of Hart Jones from the hangar\nentrance, \"there's no time to lose. The _Pioneer_ takes off immediately\nafter the big fellow.\"\n\nWe hurried to the waiting ship, which seemed like a tiny toy when\ncompared with the giant SF-22. I had observed very little of the\nconstruction of the _Pioneer_, but I could now see that she was quite\ndifferent in design from the ordinary plane. A monoplane she was, but\nthe wing structure was abnormally short and of great thickness, and\nthere were a number of tubes projecting from the leading edge that gave\nthe appearance of a battery of small cannon. The body, like all planes\ndesigned for travel in air-level six, was cigar-shaped, and had\nhermetically sealed ports and entrance manholes. A cluster of the\ncannon-shaped tubes enclosed the tail just back of the fins and rudder\nand, behind the wing structure atop the curved upper surface of the\nbody, there was a sphere of gleaming metal that was probably three feet\nin diameter.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBefore I could formulate questions regarding the unusual features of the\ndesign, we were within the _Pioneer's_ cabin and Hart Jones was engaged\nin clamping the entrance manhole cover to its rubber seat. A throbbing\nroar that penetrated our double hull attracted my attention and, looking\nthrough a nearby porthole, I saw that the convoy of army planes had\ntaken off and was circling over the SF-22 in anticipation of her start.\nTrim, speedy fighting ships these were, with heavy caliber machine-guns\nin turrets fore and aft and normally manned by crews of twelve each. The\nunder surfaces of their bodies glistened smooth and sleek in the light\nfrom the field, for the landing gears had been drawn within and the\nopenings sealed by the close-fitted armor plate that protected these\nordinarily vulnerable portions when in flight.\n\nThe SF-22 was ready to take off and the crowds were drawing back into\nthe obscurity beyond the huge circle of blinding light. One after\nanother her twelve engines sputtered into life, and ponderously she\nmoved over the field, gathering speed as the staccato barking of the\nexhausts gradually blended into a smooth though deafening purr. The tail\nof the great vessel came up, then the wheels, and she was off into the\nnight.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHart Jones sat at a bewildering array of instruments that covered almost\nthe entire forward partition of the cabin. He pressed a button and the\nstarting motor whined for a moment. Then the single engine of the\n_Pioneer_ coughed and roared. Slowly we taxied in the direction taken by\nthe SF-22, whose lights were now vanishing in the darkness. I saw George\nopen a valve on the wall and Hart stretched the fingers of his left hand\nto what appeared to be the keyboard of a typewriter set into the\ninstrument board. He pressed several of the keys and pulled back his\nstick. There was a whistling scream from astern and I was thrown back in\nmy seat with painful force. With that, the motor roared into full speed\nand we had left the airport far behind.\n\n\"What on earth?\" I gasped.\n\n\"Rocket propulsion,\" laughed Hart. \"I should have warned you. Those\ntubes you saw outside at the tail and along the leading edge of the\nwings. Only used three of them, but that was sufficient for the\ntake-off.\"\n\n\"But I thought this rocket business was not feasible on account of the\nwastage of fuel due to its low efficiency,\" I objected.\n\n\"We should worry about fuel,\" said Hart.\n\nI looked about me and saw that there was very little space for the\nstorage of this essential commodity. \"Why?\" I inquired. \"What fuel do\nyou use?\"\n\n\"Make our own,\" he replied shortly. He was busy at the moment,\nmaneuvering the _Pioneer_ into a position above and behind the SF-22 and\nher convoy.\n\n\"You make your own fuel enroute?\" I asked in astonishment.\n\n\"Yes. That sphere you saw on top. It is the collecting end of an\nelectrical system for extracting nitrogen and other elements, from the\nair. This extraction goes on constantly while we are in the atmosphere\nand my fuel is an extremely powerful explosive of which nitrates are the\nbase. The supply is replenished continuously, so we have no fear of\nrunning short even in the upper levels.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGeorge had crawled through a small opening into some inaccessible region\nin the stern of the vessel. I pondered over what Hart had just told me,\nstill keeping my eyes glued to the port, through which could be seen the\nfleet we were following. The altimeter registered thirty-five thousand\nfeet. We were entering air-level six--the stratosphere! Below us the\ntroposphere, divided into five levels, each of seven thousand feet,\nteemed with the life of the air. The regular lanes were filled with\ntraffic, the lights of the speeding thousands of freight and pleasure\ncraft moving in orderly procession along their prescribed routes.\n\nUp here in the sixth level, which was entirely for high-speed traffic of\ncommercial and government vessels making transcontinental or\ntransoceanic voyages, we were the only adventurers in sight--we and the\nconvoyed liner we were following. The speed indicator showed six hundred\nmiles an hour, and the tiny spot of light that traveled over the chart\nto indicate our position showed that we were nearing Buffalo.\n\nGlancing through one of the lower ports, I saw the lights of the city\nshining dimly through a light mist that fringed the shore of Lake Erie\nand extended northward along the Niagara. Then we were out over the\nlake, and the luminous hue was slipping rapidly behind. I looked ahead\nand saw that the distance to the SF-22 and her convoy had somewhat\nincreased. We were a mile behind and some two thousand feet above them.\nEvidently Hart was figuring on keeping at a safe distance for\nobservation of anything that might happen.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOur motor was running smoothly and the angle of the propeller blades had\nbeen altered to take care of the change in air density from the lower\naltitudes. It flashed across my mind that this was an ideal location for\nan attack, if such was to be made on the SF-22.\n\nThen, far ahead, I saw a beam of light stab through the darkness and\nstrike the tossing surface of the lake. Another and another followed,\nand I could see that the SF-22 and her convoy were surrounded by these\nunearthly rays. They converged from high above to outline a brilliant\ncircle where they met on the surface of the waters, and in the midst of\nthe cone formed by the beams, the liner and its seven tiny followers\ncould be seen to falter, and huddle more closely together.\n\nIt all happened in the twinkling of an eye--so quickly, in fact, that\nHart and I had not the time to exchange remarks over the strange\noccurrence. For a moment the eight vessels hovered, halted suddenly by\nthis inexplicable force from out the heavens. Then there rose from the\napex of the inverted cone of light a blinding column of blue-white\nradiance that poured skyward an instant and was gone. To our ears came a\nterrific roaring that could be likened to nothing we had heard on earth.\nThe _Pioneer_ was tossed and buffeted as by a cyclone, and George came\ntumbling from the opening he had entered, his round face grown solemn.\nThen came eery silence, for the _Pioneer's_ motor had gone dead. Ahead\nthere was utter darkness. The liner and her convoy had completely\nvanished and the _Pioneer_ was slipping into a spin!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What's up?\" asked George of Hart, who was tugging frantically at the\ncontrols.\n\n\"The liner has gone the way of the first two,\" he replied: \"and the yarn\nabout the pillar of fire was not so far wrong after all.\"\n\n\"You saw the same thing?\" asked George incredulously.\n\n\"Yes, and so did Jack. There came some beams of light from the sky; then\nthe pillar of fire and the roaring you heard, after which the vessels\nwere gone and our electrical system paralyzed.\"\n\n\"Holy smoke!\" ejaculated George. \"What to do now?\"\n\nAs he spoke, the _Pioneer_ came out of the spin, and we were able to\nresume our positions in the seats. None of us was strapped in, and we\nhad been clinging to whatever was handiest to keep from being tossed\nabout in the cabin. Hart wiped his forehead and growled out an oath. The\ninstrument board was still illuminated, for its tiny lamps were supplied\nwith current from the storage battery. But the main lights of the cabin\nand the ignition system refused to function. We were gliding now, but\nlosing altitude rapidly, having already dropped to the lower limits of\nlevel five.\n\n\"Can't you use the rocket tubes?\" I inquired hesitatingly.\n\n\"They are fired in the same manner as the motor,\" replied Hart; \"but we\nmight try an emergency connection from the storage battery, which is\nordinarily used only in starting and for the panel lights.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGeorge was already fussing with the connections in a small junction box\nfrom which he had removed the cover. Meanwhile, the black waters of Lake\nErie were rushing upward to meet us, and the needle of the altimeter\nregistered twelve thousand feet.\n\n\"Here's the trouble!\" shouted George, triumphantly holding up a small\nobject he had removed from the junction box. \"Ignition fuse is blown.\"\n\n\"Probably by some radiations from the cone of light and the column that\ndestroyed the liner. Lucky we were no closer,\" were Hart's muttered\ncomments.\n\nGeorge produced a spare fuse and inserted it in its proper place. The\ncabin lights glowed instantly and the motor started at once.\n\n\"Well, I'm going up after the generators of this mysterious force that\nis destroying our cross-country ships and killing our people,\" asserted\nHart. \"The rays came from high above, but the _Pioneer_ can go as high\nas anything that ever flew--_higher_.\"\n\nHe snapped a switch and a beam of light that rivalled the so-called\npillar of fire bored far into the night, dimming the stars by its\nbrilliance. Again his fingers strayed to the rows of white keys and the\nrocket tubes shrieked in response to his pressure. This time I was\nprepared for the shock of acceleration, but the action was maintained\nfor several seconds and I found the pressure against my back growing\npainful. Then it was relieved, and I glanced at the altimeter. Its\nneedle had reached the end of the scale, which was graduated to eighty\nthousand feet!\n\n\"Good Lord!\" I exclaimed. \"Do you mean to tell me that we are more than\nsixteen miles in the air?\"\n\n\"Nearly thirty,\" replied Hart, pointing to another dial which I had not\nseen. This one was graduated in miles above sea-level, and its needle\nwavered between the twenty-nine and thirty mark!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAgain Hart pressed the rocket buttons, and we shot still higher into the\nheavens. Thirty, forty, fifty miles registered the meter, and still we\nclimbed.\n\n\"Great Scott!\" blurted a voice I knew was my own, though I had no\nconsciousness of willing the speech. \"At this rate we'll reach the\nmoon!\"\n\n\"We could, if we wished,\" was Hart's astounding reply; \"I wish you\nwouldn't say too much about it when we return. We have oxygen to breathe\nand an air-tight vessel to retain it. With the fuel we are using, we\ncould easily do it, provided a sufficient supply were available.\nHowever, the _Pioneer_ does not have large enough storage tanks as yet,\nand, of course, we cannot now replenish our supply with sufficient\nrapidity, for the atmosphere has become very rare indeed--where we are.\nMy ultimate object, though, in building the _Pioneer_, was to construct\na vessel that is capable of a trip to the moon.\"\n\n\"You think you could reach a great enough velocity to escape the\ngravitational pull of the earth?\" I asked, marveling more and more at\nthe temerity and resourcefulness of my science-minded friend.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" he replied. \"The speed required is less than seven miles a\nsecond, and I have calculated that the _Pioneer_ can do no less than\ntwenty.\"\n\nMentally I multiplied by sixty. I could hardly credit the result. Twelve\nhundred miles a minute!\n\n\"But, how about the acceleration?\" I ventured. \"Could the human body\nstand up under the strain?\"\n\n\"That is the one problem remaining,\" he replied; \"and I am now working\non a method of neutralizing it. From the latest results of our\nexperiments, George and I are certain of its feasibility.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe _Pioneer_ was now losing altitude once more, and Hart played the\nbeam of the searchlight in all directions as we descended. He and George\nwatched through one of the floor ports and I followed suit. We were\nfalling, unhampered by air resistance, and our bodies were practically\nweightless with reference to the _Pioneer_. It was a strange sensation:\nthere was the feeling of exhilaration one experiences when inhaling the\nfirst whiff of nitrous oxide in the dentist's chair--a feeling of\nabsolute detachment and care-free confidence in the ultimate result of\nour precipitous descent.\n\nI found considerable amusement in pushing myself from side to side of\nthe cabin with a mere touch of a finger. There was no up nor down, and\nsometimes it seemed to me that we were drifting sideways, sometimes that\nwe fell upward rather than downward. Hart and George were unconcerned.\nEvidently they were quite accustomed to the sensations. They bent their\nevery energy toward discovering what had caused the disaster to the\nSF-22 and its convoy.\n\nFor several hours we cruised about on the strangest search ever made in\nthe air. Alternately shooting skyward to unconscionable altitudes and\ndropping to levels five and six to replenish our fuel supply, we covered\nthe greater portion of the United States before the night was over. But\nthe powerful searchlight of the _Pioneer_ failed to disclose anything\nthat might be remotely connected with the disappearance of the SF-22.\n\nFor me it was a never-to-be-forgotten experience. Lightning dashes from\ncoast to coast which required but a few minutes of time--circling many\nmiles above New York or Washington or Savannah in broad daylight with\nthe sun low on the up-curved horizon; then shooting westward into the\ndarkness and skirting the Pacific coast less than fifteen minutes later,\nbut with four hours' actual time difference. Space and time were almost\none.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHart had not provided the _Pioneer_ with a radio or television\ntransmitter, but there was an excellent receiver, and, through its\nagency we learned that the world was in a veritable uproar over the\nlatest visitation of the mysterious terror of the sixth air level. All\ncommercial traffic in levels four, five and six was ordered\ndiscontinued, and the government air control stations were flashing long\nmessages in code, the import of which could but be guessed. Vision\nflashes showed immense gatherings at the large airports and in the\npublic squares of the great cities, where the general populace become\nmore and more excited and terrified by the awful possibilities pictured\nby various prominent speakers.\n\nThe governments of all foreign powers made haste to disclaim\nresponsibility for the air attacks or for any attempt at making war on\nthe United States. News broadcasts failed to mention Hart Jones or the\n_Pioneer_, since the mission had been kept secret. The phenomenon of the\nrays and the roaring column of light had been observed from many points\non this occasion and there was no longer any doubt as to the nature of\nthe terror as visible to the eye, though theories as to the action and\nsource of the rays conflicted greatly and formed the basis of much\nheated discussion.\n\nEventually the advancing dawn reached San Francisco, and with its advent\nHart decided to make a landing in that city so that my bonds could be\ndelivered.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJones was apparently a very much mystified and discouraged man. \"Jack,\"\nhe said, \"it seems to me that this thing is but the beginning of some\ntremendous campaign that is being waged against our country by a clever\nand powerful enemy. And I feel that our work in connection with the\nunraveling of the mystery and overcoming the enemy or enemies is but\nbegun. It's a cinch that the thing is organized by human minds and is\nnot any sort of a freak of the elements. Our work is cut out for us, all\nright, and I wish you would stick to George and me through the mess.\nWill you?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I agreed, readily enough. \"After these bonds are delivered I am\nfree for a month.\"\n\n\"Ha! Ha!\" cackled George, without mirth. \"A month! We're doggoned lucky\nif we get to the bottom of this in a year.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" snapped Hart, who was considerably upset by the failure to\nlocate the source of the disastrous rays. \"There is nothing supernatural\nabout this, and anything that can be explained on a scientific basis can\nbe run to earth in short order. These rays are man-made and, as such,\ncan be accounted for by man. Our greatest scientists must be put to work\non the problem at once--in fact, they have quite probably been called in\nby the government already.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was maneuvering the _Pioneer_ to a landing on the broad field of the\nSan Francisco airport. Hundreds of idle planes of all sizes lined the\nfield, and, unmindful of the earliness the hour, a great crowd was\ncollected in expectation of sensational reports from the occupants of\narriving ships. The unusual construction of the _Pioneer_ attracted\nconsiderable attention and it was with difficulty that the police kept\nback the crowd when she rolled to a stop near the office of the local\ngovernment supervisor. We hustled inside and were greeted by that\nofficial with open arms.\n\n\"Glory be!\" he exclaimed. \"Hart Jones and the _Pioneer_. Every airport\nin the land has been on the lookout for you all night. It was feared you\nhad been lost with the SF-22 and the others. Code messages to the\nsupervisors of all districts advised of your mission, though it has been\nkept out of the general news, as has the message from the enemy.\"\n\n\"Message from the enemy!\" gasped Hart, George and I, echoing the words\nlike parrots.\n\n\"Yes. A demand that the United States surrender, and a threat to descend\ninto the lower levels if the demand is not complied with in twenty-four\nhours!\"\n\n\"Who is this enemy?\" asked Hart, \"and where?\"\n\n\"Who they are is not known,\" replied the official gravely; \"and as to\nthe location, the War Department is puzzled. Direction finders\nthroughout the country took readings on the position of their radio\ntransmitter and these readings differed widely in result. But the\nconsensus of opinion is that the messages originate somewhere out in\nspace, probably between fifty and one hundred thousand miles from our\nearth.\"\n\n\"Great guns!\" Hart glanced at George and me, where we stood with\nstupidly hanging jaws. \"And what does the government want of me now?\"\n\n\"You are considered to be the one man who might be able to cope with the\nproblem, and are ordered to report to the Secretary of War, in person,\nimmediately.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHart was electrified into instant activity. \"Here,\" he said in a voice\nof authority that commanded the official's attention and respect, \"see\nthat this package of bonds is delivered at once to the addressee and\nthat the addressor is advised of its safe arrival. We're off at once.\"\n\nSuiting action to the words, he thrust my packet into the hands of the\nastonished supervisor. Then, turning sharply on his heel, he flung back,\n\"Advise the Secretary of War that I shall report to him in person in\nless than one hour.\"\n\nAs we stepped through the entrance of the _Pioneer_, he shot a final\nlook at the official and laughed heartily at his sudden accession of\nenergy. We had not the slightest doubt that Hart's orders would be\nimmediately and efficiently carried out.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn precisely forty-five minutes, we stood before the desk of Lawrence\nSimler, then Secretary of War, in Washington.\n\n\"You are Mr. Hartley Jones?\" inquired the stern-visaged little man.\n\n\"I am, Mr. Secretary, and these are my friends and co-workers, George\nBoehm and John Makely.\"\n\nThe Secretary acknowledged the introduction gravely, then plunged into\nthe heart of the matter at hand with the quick energy for which he was\nfamed.\n\n\"It may or may not be a serious situation,\" he said, \"but certainly it\nhas thus far been quite alarming. In any event, we have taken the matter\nout of the hands of the Air Traffic Bureau. We are prepared to defy the\nultimatum of the enemy, whoever he may be. But we want your help, Mr.\nJones. Every ship of the Air Navy will be in the upper levels within the\nprescribed twenty-four hours, and we will endeavor to stave off their\nattacks until such time as you can fit the _Pioneer_ for a journey to\ntheir headquarters.\"\n\n\"How can your antiquated war vessels, capable of hurling a high\nexplosive shell no more than fifty miles, fight off an enemy that is\nthousands of miles distant?\" asked Hart.\n\n\"It is believed by the research engineers of the government that, though\ntheir headquarters may be located at a great distance, the raiders drop\nto a comparatively low altitude at the time of one of their attacks,\nreturning immediately thereafter to their base.\"\n\nHart Jones shook his head. \"The engineers may be correct,\" he stated;\n\"but how on earth can you expect a little vessel like the _Pioneer_ to\nbattle an enemy who is possessed of these terribly destructive weapons\nand who has sufficient confidence in his own invulnerability to declare\nwar on the greatest country on earth?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSecretary Simler dropped his voice to a confidential tone, and his keen\ngray eyes flashed excitement as he unfolded the details of the\ndiscoveries and plans of the War Department. We three listened in\nundisguised amazement to a tale of the unceasing labors of our Secret\nService agents in foreign countries, of elaborate experiments with\ndeadly weapons and the chemicals of warfare.\n\nWe heard of marvelous new rays that could be projected for many miles\nand destroy whole armies at a single blast; rays that would, in less\ntime than that required to tell of the feat, reduce to a mass of fused\nmetal the greatest firstline battleships of the old days of ocean\nwarfare. We heard of preparations for defensive warfare throughout the\ncivilized world, preparedness that insured so terrible and final a war\nthat it was literally impossible for a great world conflagration to\nagain break out. We learned that the present mysterious signs of a\ncoming war could not possibly have originated in any country on earth,\nelse they would have been known of long in advance, due to the network\nof the Secret Service system. This war, so unexpectedly thrust upon us,\nwas undoubtedly a war of planets!\n\n\"But,\" objected Hart, \"the messages were in English, were they not?\"\n\n\"They were,\" continued Secretary Simler, \"and that puzzled our experts\nin the beginning. But, it may well be that our enemy from out the skies\nhas had spies among us for many years and could thus have learned our\nlanguages and radio codes. In any event, we are to meet destructive rays\nwith others equally destructive, and you, Hartley Jones, are the man who\ncan make our effectiveness certain.\"\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"Yes. How long a time will be required in fitting out the _Pioneer_ for\nreliable space flying?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHart Jones pondered the matter and I could see that he was overjoyed at\nthe prospect of getting into the thing in earnest. \"About one week,\" he\nreplied, \"providing you can send a force of fifty expert mechanics to my\nhangar at once and supply all material as fast as I shall require it.\"\n\n\"Excellent,\" said the Secretary. \"We'll have the men there in a few\nhours and will obtain whatever you need, regardless of cost, for\nimmediate delivery. Incidentally, there will be several scientists as\nwell, who will supervise the installation of two types of ray generators\nand their projecting mechanisms on the _Pioneer_. You will need them\nlater.\"\n\n\"I don't doubt we shall,\" said Hart. \"And now, with your permission, we\nshall leave for the hangar. I'm ready to start work.\"\n\n\"Capital!\" Secretary Simler pressed every one of a row of buttons set in\nhis desk top. We were dismissed.\n\n\"Well,\" said I, when we reached the outside, \"he has given you quite a\njob, Hart!\"\n\n\"You said something,\" he replied. \"But, if this threat from the skies\nproves as real and as calamitous as I think it will, we all have our\nwork cut out for us.\"\n\n\"Do you really believe this enemy comes from another planet?\" asked\nGeorge as we entered the _Pioneer_ for the trip home.\n\n\"Where else can they be from?\" countered Hart. \"But, really it makes no\ndifference to us now. We have to go after them in earnest. Don't want to\nquit, do you, George?\"\n\n\"Wha-a-at?\" shouted George, as he jerked savagely at the main switch of\nthe _Pioneer_. \"You know me better than that, Hart. Did I ever let you\ndown in anything?\"\n\n\"No,\" admitted the smiling Hart, \"you never did, bless your heart. But\nJack here is another matter. He has a wife and two kids to look after.\nThat lets him out automatically.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy heart sank at the words, for I knew that he meant what he said. And,\ntruth to tell, I saw the justice in his remarks.\n\n\"But, Hart,\" I faltered, \"I'd like to be in on this thing.\"\n\n\"I know you would, old man. But I think it's out of the question, for\nthe present at least. You can help with the reconstruction of the\n_Pioneer_, however.\"\n\nAnd meekly I accepted his dictum, though with secretly conflicting\nemotions. Little did I realize at the time that Hart knew far more than\nhe pretended and that he had merely attempted to salve his own\nconscience in this manner.\n\nI was very anxious to return to my family, and, as I sped homeward in a\ntaxicab after the _Pioneer_ landed at her own hangar, my mind was filled\nwith doubts and fears. Secretary Simler had been very brief in his talk,\nbut his every word carried home the gravity of the situation. What if\nthese invaders carried the war to the surface? Suppose they seared the\ncountryside and the cities and suburbs with rays of horrible nature that\nwould shrivel and blast all that lay in their path? My heart chilled at\nthe thought and it was a distinct relief when I gazed on my little home\nand saw that it was safe--so far. I paid the driver with a much too\nlarge bank note and dashed up my own front steps two at a time.\n\nA few hours later I tore myself away and returned to the hangar, where\nthe _Pioneer_ now reposed in a scaffolded cradle. The sight which met my\neyes was astonishing in the extreme, for the hangar had been transformed\ninto a huge workshop with seemingly hundreds of men already at work. It\nwas a scene of furious activity, and, to my utter amazement, I observed\nthat the _Pioneer_ was already in an advanced stage of disassembly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI had no difficulty in locating Hart Jones, for he was striding from\nlathe to workbench to boring mill, issuing his orders with the sureness\nand decision of a born leader of men. He welcomed me in his most brisk\nmanner and immediately assigned me to a portion of the work in the\nchemical laboratory--something I was at least partly fitted for.\n\nWe labored far into the night, when a siren called us to rest and food.\nThis was to be a night and day job, and not a man of those on duty gave\nthought to the intense nervous and physical strain. Sixty-five of us I\nlearned there were, though it had seemed there were several times that\nnumber.\n\nDuring the rest period, Hart switched on the large television and sound\nmechanism of the public news broadcasts. Great excitement prevailed\nthroughout the United States, for there had been a leak and the news had\ngone abroad regarding the message from the enemy. There was widespread\npanic and disorder and the government was besieged with demands for\nauthentic news. The twenty-four hours of grace had nearly expired.\n\nFinally the public was told of what actually was happening. Our entire\nfleet of one thousand air cruisers was in air-level six, waiting for the\nenemy. America was going to fight in earnest!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFlashes of our air cruisers in construction and in action came over the\nscreen; voice-vision records of the popular officers of the fleet\nfollowed in quick succession. Then came the blow--the first of the\nstrange war.\n\nTwo vessels of the air fleet had been destroyed by the triple rays and\npillar of fire! Fifty cruisers rushing to the scene had been unable to\nfind any traces of the source of the deadly rays. And, this time, there\nwas an alarming added element. The pillar of fire had risen from a point\nnear Gadsden in Alabama and, in its wake, there spread a sulphurous,\nsmoldering fire that crept along the ground and destroyed all in its\npath. Farms, factories, and even the steel rails of the railroads were\nconsumed and burned into the ground as if by the breath of some\ntremendous blast furnace. Hundreds of inhabitants of the section\nperished, and it was reported that the fumes from the strange fires were\ndrifting in the direction of Birmingham, terrifyingly visible in\nblue-green clouds of searing vapor.\n\nWith the first news of the disaster came a wave of fear that spread over\nthe country with the rapidity of the ether waves that carried the news.\nThen came stern determination. This enemy must be swept from the skies!\nGatherings in public places volunteered en masse for whatever service\nthe government might ask of them. The entire world was in an uproar, and\nfrom Great Britain, France, Germany and Russia, came immediate offers of\ntheir air fleets to assist in fighting off the Terror.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn less than an hour there were nearly five thousand cruisers in\nair-level six, patroling its entire depth from thirty-five thousand to\none hundred thousand feet altitude.\n\nWe resumed work in the hangar, but the news service was kept in\noperation as far as the amplifiers were concerned, though the television\nscreen was switched off on account of the likelihood of its distracting\nthe workers.\n\nAgain came the report of a major disaster, this time over Butte in\nMontana. Four American vessels and one British were the victims in level\nsix. And the city of Butte was in flames; blue, horrible flames that\nliterally melted the city into the ground. Again there was no trace of\nthe invaders.\n\nHow puny were the efforts of the five thousand air cruisers! Marvels of\nengineering and mechanical skill, these vessels were. Deadly as were the\nweapons they carried--weapons so terrible that war on earth was\nconsidered impossible since their development--they were helpless\nagainst an enemy who could not be located. Though our vessels were\ncapable of boring high into the stratosphere, the enemy worked from\nstill higher.\n\n\"Holy smoke!\" gasped Hart Jones, who had stopped at my side. \"What a\ncontract I have on my hands!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe looked in the direction of the partly dismantled _Pioneer_, and I\ncould see by the fixedness of his stare that he was thinking of her\ninsignificant size in comparison with the job she was to undertake.\n\nAbove the din of the machines in the hangar rang the startled voice of a\nnews announcer. Panic-stricken he seemed, and we stopped to listen.\nAnother blow of the terror of the skies--and now close by! Over\nWestchester County in New York State there was a repetition of the\nprevious attacks. Only two of the cruisers had vanished this time; but\nseveral towns, including Larchmont and Scarsdale, were pools of molten\nfire!\n\nSick at heart, I thought of my little home in Rutherford and of the dear\nones it contained. I thought of telephoning, but, what was the use?\nThere was no warding off of this terrible thing that had so suddenly\ncome to our portion of the world. It was the blowing of the last\ntrumpet, the way things looked.\n\nThe announcer had calmed himself. His voice droned tonelessly now, as\nwas the custom. Another raid, on the Mexican Border now. We were\nstupefied by the rapidity of the enemy's attacks; then electrified once\nmore by the most astounding news of all. Alexandria, in Egypt, was the\nbase of a pillar of fire! Fully half of the city was wiped out, and the\nremainder in a mortal funk, terrorized and riotous. The United States\nwas not alone in the war!\n\nThe foreign fleets which reinforced our own were ordered home\nimmediately. But to what avail? The world was doomed!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the morning, after nine fearful attacks during the night, there came\nanother message from the enemy and this was repeated in five languages\nand addressed to the entire world:\n\n\"People of Earth,\" it read, \"this is our final warning. One chance has\nbeen given and you have proved stubborn. Consider well that your\ncivilization be not entirely destroyed, and answer as the expiration of\nforty-eight hours, using our transmitting frequency. Our hand is to be\nwithheld for that period only, when, unless our demands are met, all of\nyour large cities and towns will be destroyed. Our terms for peace are\nthat we be permitted to land without resistance on your part; that you\nsurrender farm and forest lands, cities and towns, able-bodied men of\ntwenty to forty, selected women of seventeen to thirty, and tribute in\nthe form of such supplies and precious metals as we may specify, all to\nthe extent of forty per cent of your resources. No compromise will be\naccepted.\"\n\nThat was all. It was during a rest period at the Jones hangar and I had\nbrought Hart and George to my home for breakfast. We sat at the table\nwhen the news instrument brought the message. Marie was pouring the\ncoffee, and my two small boys, Jim and Jack, had gone to the playroom,\nfrom whence their joyous voices could be heard. We four were struck dumb\nat the announcement, and Marie looked at me with so awful an expression\nof dread that my coffee turned bitter in my mouth. Marie was just\ntwenty-eight!\n\n\"What beasts!\" cried Hart. \"Allow them to land without resistance? I\nshould say not! Rather we should fight them off until all of us perish.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe had risen from his chair in his anger. Now he sat down suddenly and\nshook a forefinger in my face.\n\n\"Say!\" he exploded. \"You can't tell me that some master mind of our own\nworld is not back of this!\"\n\n\"I'm not telling you,\" I replied, startled at the fierce fire that\nflashed from his eyes.\n\n\"I know. I'm just trying to think aloud and I'm liable to say anything.\nBut this sort of business is the work of humans as sure as you're born.\nStill I believe that what Simler says is true. I can't believe that any\ncountry on earth is back of the thing. It must be an attack from beings\nof another planet, but I think they have as a leader a man who is of\nour own earth.\"\n\nMarie's eyes opened wide at this. \"But how could that be?\" she asked.\n\"Surely no one from our earth has made the trip to one of the other\nplanets?\"\n\n\"It may be that someone has,\" replied Hart. \"Do you remember Professor\nOradel? Remember, about ten years ago, I think it was, when he and a\nhalf dozen or more of extremely radical scientists built a rocket they\nclaimed would reach the moon? They were ridiculed and hissed and\nrelegated to the position of half-baked, crazy inventors. But Oradel had\na large private fortune, and he and his crowd built themselves a\nworkshop and laboratory in a secluded region in the Ozarks. Here they\nlabored and experimented and eventually the rocket ship was constructed.\nNo person was in their confidence, but when the machine was completed\nthey issued a statement to the press to the effect that they were ready\nfor the voyage to the moon, and that, when they returned, a reckoning\nwith the world was to be made for its disbelief and total lack of\nsympathy. Again the press subjected Oradel to a series of scathing\ndenunciations, and the scientific publications refused to take\ncognizance of his claims in any way, shape or form.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Then, one night, a great rocket roared into the heavens, leaving a\nterror-stricken countryside in the wake of its brilliantly visible tail.\nSeveral observatories whose telescopes picked up and followed the trail\nof the contraption reported that it described a huge parabola, mounting\nhigh into the stratosphere and falling back to earth, where it was lost\nin the depths of the Pacific Ocean. There the thing ended and it was\nsoon forgotten. But I believe that this rocket ship of Oradel's reached\nMars or Venus and that the peoples of whichever planet they reached have\nbeen prevailed upon and prepared to war upon the world.\"\n\n\"That would explain their knowledge of our languages and codes.\" I\nventured, \"and would likewise account for the fact that the first of our\nships to be attacked were those carrying large shipments of currency.\nThough if these were destroyed by the fire columns, I can not see what\ngood the money would do them.\"\n\n\"Don't believe the first three were destroyed,\" grunted Hart. \"You'll\nremember that in these cases the pillars of fire, or whatever you want\nto call them, were of a cold light, whereas now they are viciously hot\nand leave behind them the terrible destructive fires that spread and\nspread and seemingly never are extinguished. No, I think that the force\nused is something of the nature of an atom-disrupting triad of beams and\nthat these set up the column as a veritable tornado, a whirling column\nof roaring wind rushing skyward with tremendous velocity. The first\nships, I believe, were carried into the stratosphere and captured intact\nby the enemy.\n\n\"Since the declaration of war the nature of the column has altered. The\nthree beams, instead of meeting at or near the surface of the earth, now\njoin high in the heavens and the column strikes downward instead of\nexpending its force upward. An added energy is used which produces the\nterribly destructive force below. And now we are able to locate\nfragments of the ships destroyed above, whereas previously there were no\ntraces.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Sounds reasonable,\" commented George. \"But why have they not landed and\nwaged their war right here without warning, if that is what they now\nintend to do?\"\n\n\"A natural question, George. But I have a hunch that the space flier or\nfliers of the enemy are conserving fuel by remaining beyond gravity. You\nknow, in space flying, the greatest expenditures of energy are in\nleaving or landing on a body and, once landed, they might not have\nsufficient fuel for a getaway. They know we are not exactly helpless,\nonce they are in our midst, and are taking this means of reducing us to\nthe point of complete subjection before risking their precious selves\namong us.\"\n\nThe telephone startled us by its insistent ring. It was a call from the\nhangar for Hart. The news broadcast announcer was in the midst of a long\ndissertation regarding the discovery only this morning that there were\ncertain apparent discrepancies in the movements of the tides and\nunwonted perturbations of the moon's orbit. There flashed on the screen\na view of the great observatory at Mount Wilson, and Professor Laughlin\nof that institution stepped into the foreground of the scene to take up\nthe discussion so mechanically repeated by the announcer.\n\n\"Must leave for the hangar at once,\" declared Hart, returning from the\ntelephone. \"Simler and his staff are there and we are wanted\nimmediately.\"\n\n\"Oh, Jack!\" Marie begged with her eyes.\n\n\"Got to be done, Honey,\" I responded, \"and, believe me, I am going to do\nwhat little I can to help. Suppose we surrendered!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI shuddered anew at the very thought and took hurried leave of my\nfamily, Hart and George awaiting me in the hall. Had I known what was to\ntranspire before the end of the war, I am certain I would have been in\nmuch less of a hurry.\n\nWe rushed to the hangar, where Secretary Simler and his party awaited us\nin the office. Rather, I should say, they waited for Hart Jones.\n\n\"Mr. Jones,\" said the Secretary of War, when the introductions were\nover, \"it is up to you to get the _Pioneer_ in shape to go out after\nthese terrible creatures before the forty-eight hours have expired. We\nhave replied to their ultimatum and have told them we will have our\nanswer ready within the appointed time, but it is already agreed between\nthe nations of the World Alliance that our reply is to be negative.\nBetter far that we submit to the utter destruction of our civilization\nthan agree to their terms.\"\n\n\"I believe I can do it, Mr. Secretary,\" was Hart Jones' simple comment.\n\"At least I will try. But you must let me have an experienced astronomer\nat once with whom to consult.\"\n\n\"Astronomer?\"\n\n\"Yes--immediately. I have a theory, but am not enough of a student of\nastronomy myself to work it out.\"\n\n\"You shall have the best man in the Air Naval Observatory at once.\"\nSecretary Simler chewed his cigar savagely. \"And anything else you might\nneed,\" he concluded.\n\n\"There is nothing else, sir.\" Hart turned from the great men who\nregarded him solemnly, some with expressions of hope, others with plain\ndistrust written large on their countenances.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey left in silence and we returned to our work with renewed vigor.\nWithin an hour there arrived by fast plane an undersized,\nthick-spectacled man who presented himself as Professor Linquist\nfrom the government observatory. He was immediately taken into the\noffice by Hart and the two remained behind closed doors for the best\npart of four hours.\n\nMeanwhile the hangar hummed with activity as usual. We in the chemical\nlaboratory were engaged in compounding the high explosive used as fuel\nin the _Pioneer_. This was being compressed to its absolute limit and\nwas stored in long steel cylinders in the form of a liquid of extremely\nlow temperature. These cylinders were at once transferred to a special\nsteel vault where the temperature was kept at a low enough point to\nprevent expansion and consequent loss of the explosive, not to speak of\nthe danger of destroying the entire lot of us in its escape.\n\nThe generating apparatus of the _Pioneer_ was to be dispensed with for\nthis trip, since it was of no value outside the atmosphere where there\nwas no air from which to extract the elements necessary for the\nproduction of the explosive. Instead, the entire supply of fuel for the\ntrip was to be carried aboard the vessel in the cylinders we were\nengaged in filling. Hart had calculated that there was just sufficient\nroom to store fuel for a trip of about two hundred thousand miles from\nthe earth and a safe return. We hoped this would be enough.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the scaffolding around the _Pioneer_ there were now so many workers\nthat it seemed they must forever be in one another's way. But the work\nwas progressing with extreme rapidity. Already there projected from her\nblunt nose a slender rod of shining metal which was the projector of one\nof the destructive rays whose generator and auxiliaries were being\ninstalled under the supervision of the government experts. The force had\nbeen trebled and was now working in shifts of two hours each, the pace\nbeing so exhausting that highest efficiency was obtained by using these\nshort periods.\n\nAdditional rocket tubes were being installed, and the steel framework of\na bulge now showed on the hull, this bulge being an additional fuel\nstorage compartment that would provide a slight additional resistance\nand consequently lower speed in the lower levels, but would prove little\nhindrance in level six and none at all in outer space.\n\nWhen Hart emerged from his office he appeared to be very tired, indeed,\nbut his face bore an expression of triumph that could not be mistaken.\nHe and this little scientist from Washington had evidently arrived at\nsome momentous conclusion regarding the enemy.\n\n\"Jack,\" he said, when he reached my bench during his first round of the\nhanger, \"celestial mechanics is a wonderful thing. I had a hunch, and\nthis astronomer chap has proved it correct with his mathematics. Our\nfriend the enemy is out there in space at a point where his own mass and\nvelocity are exactly counteracted by those of the earth and its\nsatellite, the moon. He is just floating around in space, doing no work\nwhatsoever to maintain his own position. He has temporarily assumed the\nr\u00f4le of a second satellite to us and is revolving around us at a\ndefinite period that was calculated by Lindquist. The gravitational pull\nof the moon keeps him from falling to the earth and that of the earth\nkeeps him from approaching the moon. The resultant of the set of forces\nis what determines his orbit and the disturbance in the normal balance\nis what has been observed by the astronomers who reported changes in the\ntides and in the moon's orbit.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"But Lindquist's figures prove that the vessel or fleet of the enemy\nmust be of tremendous size to produce such discrepancies,\ninfinitesimally small though they might seem. We have a big fellow with\nwhom to deal, but we know where to find him now.\"\n\n\"How can he work from a fixed position to make his attacks on the earth\nat such widely separated points?\" I asked.\n\n\"It isn't a fixed position in the first place, and besides the earth\nrotates once in twenty-four hours, while the moon travels around the\nearth once in about twenty-eight days. But, even so, the widespread\ndestruction could not be accounted for. He must send out scouting\nparties or something of that sort. That is one of the things we are to\nlearn when we get out there. We'll have some fun, Jack.\"\n\n\"Will the _Pioneer_ be ready?\" I asked. Evidently I was to go.\n\n\"She will, with the exception of the acceleration neutralizers. But I'm\nhaving some heavily-cushioned and elastic supports made that will, I\nbelieve, save us from injury. And I guess we can stand the discomfort\nfor once.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I agreed, \"in such a cause, I, for one, am willing to go through\nanything to help keep this overwhelming disaster from our good old\nworld.\"\n\n\"Jack,\" he whispered, \"we must prevent it. We've got to!\"\n\nThen he was gone, and I watched him for a moment as he dashed headlong\nfrom one task to another. He was a whirlwind of energy once more.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nForty-three hours and twenty minutes had passed since the receipt of the\nenemy's ultimatum. The last bolt was being tightened in the remodeled\n_Pioneer_, and Secretary Simler and his staff were on hand to witness\nthe take-off of the vessel on which the hopes of the world were pinned.\nThe news of our attempt had been spread by cable and printed news only,\nfor there was fear that the enemy might be able to pick up the\nbroadcasts of the news service and thus be able to anticipate us. As\nusual, there were many scoffers, but the consensus of opinion was in\nfavor of the project. At any rate, what better expedient was there to\noffer?\n\nThe huge airport, now unused on account of the complete cessation of air\ntraffic, was closed to the public. But there was quite a crowd to\nwitness the take-off, the visitors from Washington, the officials of the\nfield, and the two hundred workers who had enabled us to make ready for\nthe adventure in time. There were four to enter the _Pioneer_: Hart,\nGeorge, Professor Lindquist, and myself. And when the entrance manhole\nwas bolted home behind us, the watchers stood in silence, waiting for\nthe roar of the _Pioneer's_ motor. As the starter took hold, Hart waved\nhis hand at one of the ports and every man of those two hundred and some\nwatchers stood at attention and saluted is if he were a born soldier and\nHart a born commander-in-chief.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe taxied heavily across the field, for the _Pioneer_ was much\noverloaded for a quick take-off. She bumped and bounced for a\nquarter-mile before taking to the air and then climbed very slowly\nindeed, for several minutes. Our speed was a scant two hundred miles an\nhour when we swung out over New York and headed for the Atlantic. And\nthen Hart made first use of the rocket tubes, not daring to discharge\nthe hot gases below while over populated land at so low an altitude. He\ntouched one button, maintaining the pressure for but a fraction of a\nsecond. The ocean slipped more rapidly away from beneath our feet and he\ntouched the button once more. Our speed was now nearly seven hundred\nmiles an hour and we made haste to buckle ourselves into the padded,\nhammocklike contrivances which had been substituted for the former\nseats. In a very few minutes we entered level six and the motor was cut\noff entirely.\n\nA blast from a number of the tail rockets drove me into my supporting\nhammock so heavily that I found difficulty in breathing, and could\nscarcely move a muscle to change position. The rate of acceleration was\nterrific, and I am still unable to understand how Hart was able to\nmanipulate the controls. For myself, I could not even turn my head from\nits position in the padding and I felt as if I were being crushed by\nthousands of tons of pressure. Then, the pressure was somewhat relieved\nand I glanced to the instruments. We were more than a thousand miles\nfrom our starting point and the speed indicator read seven thousand\nmiles an hour. We were traveling at the rate of nearly two miles a\nsecond!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnother blast from the rockets, this one of interminable length, and I\nmust have lost consciousness. For when I next took note of things I\nfound that we had been out for nearly two hours and that the tremendous\npressure of acceleration was relieved. I moved my head, experimentally\nand found that my senses were normal, though there was a strange and\nalarming sensation of being wrong side up. Then I remembered that I had\nexperienced the same thing when we first searched the upper levels of\nthe atmosphere for the origin of the destructive rays of the enemy.\n\nBut this was different! I gazed through a nearby port and saw that the\nsky was entirely black, the stars shining magnificently brilliant\nagainst their velvet background. Streamers of brilliant sunlight from\nthe floor ports struck across the cabin and patterned the ceiling.\nLooking between my feet I saw the sun as a flaming orb with streamers of\nincandescence that spread in every direction with such blinding\nluminosity that I could not bear the sight for more than a few seconds.\nOff to what I was pleased to think of as our left side, there was a huge\nglobe that I quickly made out as our own earth. Eerily green it shone,\nand, though a considerable portion of the surface was obscured by\npatches of white that I recognized as clouds, I could clearly make out\nthe continents of the eastern hemisphere. It was a marvelous sight and I\nlost several minutes in awed contemplation of the wonder. Then I heard\nHart laugh.\n\n\"Just coming out of it, Jack?\" he asked.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI stared at him foolishly. It had seemed to me that I was alone in this\nvast universe, and the sound of his voice startled me. \"Guess I'm not\nfully out of it yet,\" I said. \"Where are we?\"\n\n\"Oh, about sixty thousand miles out,\" he replied carelessly; \"and we are\ntraveling at our maximum speed--that is, the maximum we need for this\nlittle voyage.\"\n\n\"Little voyage!\" I gasped. And then I looked at George and the professor\nand saw that they, too, were grinning at my discomfiture. I laughed\ncrazily, I suppose, for they all sobered at once.\n\nTraveling through space at more than forty thousand miles an hour, it\nseemed that we were stationary. Movement was now easy--too easy, in\nfact, for we were practically weightless. The professor was having a\ntime of it manipulating a pencil and a pad of paper on which he had a\nmass of small figures that were absolutely meaningless to me. He was\ncalculating and plotting our course and, without him, we should never\nhave reached the object we sought.\n\nTime passed rapidly, for the wonders of the naked universe were a\nnever-ending source of fascination. Occasionally a series of rocket\ncharges was fired to keep our direction and velocity, but these were\nlight, and the acceleration so insignificant that we were put to no\ndiscomfort whatever. But it was necessary that we keep our straps\nbuckled, for, in the weightless condition, even the slightest increase\nor decrease in speed or change in direction was sufficient to throw us\nthe length of the cabin, from which painful bruises might be received.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe supports to which we were strapped and which saved us from being\ncrushed by the acceleration and deceleration, were similar to hammocks,\nbeing hooked to the floor and ceiling of the cabin rather than suspended\nhorizontally in the conventional manner. This was for the reason that\nthe energy of the rockets was expended fore and aft, except for\nsteering, and the forces were therefore along the horizontal axis of the\nvessel. The supports were elastic and the padding deep and soft. Being\nswiveled at top and bottom, they could swing around so that deceleration\nas well as acceleration was relieved. For this reason the controls had\nbeen altered so that the flexible support in which Hart was suspended\ncould rotate about their pedestal, thus allowing for their operation by\nthe pilot either when accelerating or decelerating. How he could control\nthe muscles of his arms and hands under the extreme conditions is still\na mystery to me, however, and George agrees with me in this. We found\nourselves to be utterly helpless.\n\nMy next impression of the trip is that of swinging rapidly around and\nfinding myself facing the rear wall of the cabin. Then the tremendous\npressure once more at a burst from the forward tubes. We had commenced\ndeceleration. For me there were alternate periods of full and\nsemi-consciousness and, to this day, I can remember no more than the\nhigh spots of that historical expedition.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen we were free to move once more, and I turned to face the instrument\nboard. Our relative velocity had become practically zero; that is, we\nwere traveling through space at about the same speed and in the same\ndirection as the earth. The professor and Hart were consulting a pencil\nchart and excitedly looking first through the forward ports and then\ninto the screen of the periscope.\n\n\"This is the approximate location,\" averred the professor.\n\n\"But they are not here,\" replied Hart.\n\nGeorge and I peered in all directions and could see nothing excepting\nthe marvels of the universe we had been viewing. The moon now seemed\nvery close and its craters and so-called seas were as plainly visible as\nin a four-inch telescope on earth. But we saw nothing of the enemy.\n\nThe earth was a huge ball still, but much smaller than when I had first\nobserved it from the heavens. The sun's corona--the flaming streamers\nwhich the professor declared extended as much as five million miles into\nspace--was partly hidden behind the rim of the earth and the effect was\nblinding. A thin crescent of brilliant light marked the rim of our\nplanet and the rest was in shadow, but a shadow that was lighted\nawesomely in cold green by reflected light from her satellite.\n\n\"I have it!\" suddenly shouted the professor. \"We are all in very nearly\nthe same line with reference to the sun, and the enemy is between the\nblazing body and ourselves. We must shift our position, move into the\nshadow of the earth. We have missed our calculation by a few hundred\nmiles, that is all.\"\n\nAll! I thought. These astronomers, so accustomed to dealing in\ntremendous distances that must be measured in light-years, thought\nnothing of an error of several hundred miles. But I suppose it was\nreally an inconsiderable amount, at that.\n\nAt any rate, we shifted position and looked around a bit more. We saw\nnothing at first. Then Hart consulted the chronometer.\n\n\"Time is up!\" he shouted.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the instant there was a flash of dazzling green light from a point\nnot a hundred miles from our position, a flash that was followed by a\nstreaking pencil of the same light shooting earthward with terrific\nvelocity. Breathlessly we followed its length, saw it burst like a bomb\nand hurl three green balls from itself which sped at equally spaced\nangles to form a perfect triangle. They hovered a moment at about two\nthousand miles above the surface of the earth, according to the\nprofessor, who was using the telescope at the time, and shot their\ndeadly rays toward our world. We were too late to prevent the renewal of\nhostilities!\n\nAnother and another streak of green light followed and we knew that\ngreat havoc was being wrought back home. But these served to locate the\nenemy's position definitely and we immediately set about to draw nearer.\nWe were still somewhat on the dark side of the object, which had\nprevented our seeing it. Now we swung about so that it was plainly\nvisible. And, what a strange appearance it presented, out here in space!\n\nFully fifteen miles in diameter, it was a huge doughnut, a great ring of\ntubing with a center-opening that was at least eighty per cent of its\nmaximum diameter. There it hovered, sending out those deadly missiles in\na continuous stream toward our poor world. As we approached the weird\nspace flier, we saw that a number of objects floated about within the\ngreat circle of its inner circumference. The NY-18, the SF-61 and the\nSF-22, without doubt! The theory of Hart's was correct in every detail.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe were still at about ten miles distance from the great ring and the\nstreaking light pencils were speeding earthward at the rate of one a\nminute now. There was no time to lose. Already there was more\ndestruction on its way than had been previously wrought--several times\nover.\n\nHart was sighting along a tiny tube that projected into the forward\npartition and he maneuvered the _Pioneer_ until she was nose on to the\ngreat ring. He pulled a switch and there came a purring that was\nentirely new. A row of huge vacuum tubes along the wall lighted to vivid\nbrilliancy and a throbbing vibration filled the artificial air of the\ncabin.\n\nHe pulled a small lever at the side of the tube and the vessel rocked to\nthe energy that was released from those vacuum tubes. The thin rod which\nhad been installed at the _Pioneer's_ nose burst into brilliant\nflame--orange tinted luminescence that grew to a sphere of probably ten\nfeet in diameter. Then there was a heavy shock and the ball of fire left\nits position and, with inconceivable velocity, sprang straight for the\nside of the great ring. It was a fair hit and, when the weird missile\nfound its mark, it simply vanished--swallowed up in the metal walls of\nthe monster vessel. For a moment we thought nothing was to result. Then\nwe burst into shouts of joy, for a great section of the ring fused into\nnothingness and was gone! Fully a quarter of the circumference of the\nring had disappeared into the vacuum of space. Truly, the governments of\nEarth had developed some terrible weapons of their own!\n\nWe watched, breathless.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe green light pencils no longer streaked their paths of death in the\ndirection of our world, which now seemed so remote. The great ring with\nthe vacant space in its rim wabbled uncertainly for a moment as though\nsome terrific upheaval from within was tearing it asunder. Then it\nlurched directly for the _Pioneer_. We had been observed!\n\nBut Hart was equal to the occasion and he shot the _Pioneer_ in the\ndirection of the earth with such acceleration that we all were flattened\ninto our supports with the same old violence. Then, with equal violence,\nwe decelerated. The ring was following so closely that it actually\nrushed many hundreds of miles past us before it was brought to rest.\nFrom it there sprang one of the light pencils, and the _Pioneer_ was\nrocked as by a heavy gale when it rushed past on its harmless way into\ninfinity. The enemy had missed.\n\nMeanwhile, Hart was operating another mechanism that was new to the\n_Pioneer_ and again he sighted along the tiny tube. This time there was\nno sound within, no ball of fire without, no visible ray. But, when he\nhad pressed the release of this second energy, the ring seemed to\nshrivel and twist as if gripped by a giant's hand. It reeled and spun.\nThen, no longer in a balance of forces, it commenced its long drop\nearthward.\n\nHis job finished and finished well, Hart Jones collapsed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFollowing his more than three days and four nights of superhuman\nendeavor, it seemed strange to see Hart slumped white and still over the\ncontrol pedestal. He who had energy far in excess of that of any of the\nrest of us had worn himself out. Having had no rest or sleep in nearly a\nhundred hours, the body that housed so wonderful a spirit simply refused\nto carry on. Tenderly we stretched him on the cabin floor, the _Pioneer_\ndrifting in space the while. The professor, who was likewise something\nof a physician, listened to his heart, drew back his eyelids, and\npronounced him in no danger whatever.\n\nWe slapped his wrists, sprinkled his face and neck with cold water from\nthe drinking supply, and were soon rewarded by his return to\nconsciousness. He smiled weakly and fell sound asleep. No war in the\nuniverse could have wakened him then, so we lifted him to his\nfeet--rather I should say, we guided his practically floating body--and\nstrapped him in George's hammock, preparing for the homeward journey.\nThough dangling from the straps in a position that would be vertical\nwere we on earth, he slept like a baby. George took the controls in\nHart's place and the professor and I returned to our accustomed\nsupports.\n\nThe return trip was considerably slower, as George did not wish to push\nthe _Pioneer_ to its limit as had been necessary when coming out to meet\nthe enemy, nor was he able to keep control of the ship against a\ntoo-rapid acceleration. Consequently, the rate of acceleration was much\nlower and we were not nearly as uncomfortable as on the outgoing trip.\nThus, nearly ten hours were required for the return. And Hart slept\nthrough it all.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn order to make best use of the small amount of fuel still in the\ncylinders, George circled the earth five times before we entered the\nupper limits of the atmosphere, the circles becoming of smaller diameter\nat each revolution and the speed of the ship proportionately reduced. An\noccasional discharge from one of the forward rocket tubes assisted\nmaterially in the deceleration, yet, when we slipped into level five,\nour speed was so great that the temperature of the cabin rose\nalarmingly, due to the friction of the air against the hull of the\nvessel. It was necessary to use the last remaining ounce of fuel to\nreduce the velocity to a safe value. A long glide to earth was then our\nonly means of landing and, since we were over the Gulf of Mexico at the\ntime, we had no recourse other than landing in the State of Texas.\n\nPassing over Galveston in level three, we found that the Humble oil\nfields and a great section of the surrounding country had been the\ncenter of one of the enemy bombardments. All was blackness and ruin for\nmany miles between this point and Houston. At Houston Airport we landed,\nunheralded but welcome.\n\nThe lower levels were once more filled with traffic, and one of the\nsouthern route transcontinental liners had just made its stop at this\npoint. The arrival of the _Pioneer_ was thus witnessed by an unusually\nlarge crowd, and, when the news was spread to the city, their numbers\nincreased with all the rapidity made possible by the various means of\ntransportation from the city.\n\nSo it was that Hart Jones, after we finally succeeded in awakening him\nand getting him to his feet, was hailed by a veritable multitude as the\ngreatest hero of all time. The demonstrations become so enthusiastic\nthat police reserves, hastily summoned from the city, were helpless in\ntheir attempts to keep the crowd in order.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was with greatest difficulty that Hart was finally extricated from\nthe clutches of the mob and conveyed to the new Rice Hotel in Houston,\nwhere it was necessary to obtain medical attention for him immediately.\nHe was in no condition at the time to receive the richly deserved\nplaudits of the multitude, and, truth to tell, we others from the\n_Pioneer_ were in much the same shape.\n\nTo me that night will always be the most terrible of nightmares. My\nfirst thought was of my family and, when I had been assigned to a room,\nI immediately asked the switchboard operator for a long-distance\nconnection to my home in Rutherford. There was complete silence for a\nminute and I jangled the hook impatiently, my head throbbing with a\nthousand aches and pains. Then, to my surprise, the voice of the hotel\nmanager greeted me.\n\n\"Mr. Makely,\" he said softly, and I thought there was a peculiar ring in\nhis voice, \"I think you had better not try to get Rutherford this\nevening. We are sending the house physician to your room at once\nand--there are orders from Washington, you know--you are to think of\nnothing at the present but sleep and a long rest.\"\n\n\"Why--why--\" I stammered, \"can't you see? I must communicate with my\nfamily. They must know of my return. I must know if they're safe and\nwell.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, sir,\" apologized the manager, \"Government orders, you know.\"\nAnd he hung up.\n\nSomething in that soft voice brought to me an inkling of the truth. An\nicy hand gripped my heart as I heard a knock at the door. With palsied\nfingers I turned the key and admitted the professor and a kindly-faced\nelderly gentleman with a small black bag. One look at the professor told\nme the truth. I seized his two arms in a grip that made him wince.\n\n\"Tell me! Tell me!\" I demanded, \"Has anything happened to my family?\"\n\n\"Jack,\" said the professor slowly, \"while we were out there watching\nHart destroy the enemy vessel, Rutherford was destroyed!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt must be that I frightened him by my answering stare, for he backed\naway from me in apparent fear. I noticed that the doctor was rummaging\nin his bag. I know I did not speak, did not cry out, for my tongue clove\nto the roof of my mouth. It seemed I must go mad. The professor still\nbacked away from me; then, wiry little athlete that he was, he sprang\ndirectly for my knees in a beautiful football tackle. I remember that\npoint clearly and how I admired his agility at the time. I remember the\nglint of a small instrument in the doctor's hand. Then all was\nblackness.\n\nEight days later, they tell me it was, I returned to painful\nconsciousness in a hospital bed. But let me skip the agony of mind I\nexperienced then. Suffice it to say that, when I was able, I set forth\nfor Washington. Hart Jones was there and he had sent for me. But I took\nlittle interest in the going; did not even bother to speculate as to the\nreason for his summons. I had devoured the news during my convalescence\nand now, more than two weeks after the destruction of the Terror, I knew\nthe extent of the damage wrought upon our earth by those deadly green\nlight pencils we had seen issuing from the huge ring up there in the\nskies. The horror of it all was fresh in my mind, but my own private\nhorror overshadowed all.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was glad that Hart had been so signally honored by the World Peace\nBoard, that he was now the most famous and popular man in the entire\nworld. He deserved it all and more. But what cared I--I who had done\nleast of all to help in his great work--that the Terror had been found\nwhere it buried itself in the sand of the Sahara when falling to earth?\nWhat cared I that the discoveries made in the excavating of the huge\nmetal ring were of inestimable value to science?\n\nIt gave me passing satisfaction to note that all of Hart Jones' theories\nwere borne out by the discoveries; that Oradel and his minions were\nresponsible for this terrible war; that the planet they aligned against\nus was Venus and that more than a hundred thousand of the Venerians had\nbeen carried in that weird engine of destruction which had been brought\ndown by Hart.\n\nIt was interesting to read of the fall of that huge ring; how it was\nheated to incandescence when it entered our atmosphere at such\ntremendous velocity; of the tidal waves of concentric billows in the\nsand that led to its discovery by Egyptian Government planes. The\nbroadcast descriptions and the television views of the stunted and\ntwisted Venerians whose bodies were recovered from the partly consumed\nwreckage were interesting. But it all left me cold. I had no further\ninterest in life. That the world had escaped an overwhelming disaster\nwas clear, and it gave me a certain pleasure. But for me it might as\nwell have been completely destroyed.\n\nNevertheless, I went to Washington. I felt somehow that I owed it to\nHart Jones, the greatest world hero since Lindbergh. I would at least\nlisten to what he had to say.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA fast plane carried me, a plane chartered by the government. To me it\nseemed that it crawled, though it was a sixth-level ship, and made the\ntrip in record time. Why I was impatient to reach Washington I do not\nknow, for I was absolutely disinterested in anything that might occur\nthere. It was merely that my nerves were on edge, I suppose, and\neverything annoyed me.\n\nHart met me at the airport and greeted me like a long-lost brother. He\ntalked incessantly and jumped from one subject to the other with the\nobvious intention of trying to get my mind off my troubles until we\nreached his office in the Air Traffic building.\n\nOn his door there was the legend, \"Director of Research,\" and, when we\nhad entered, I observed that the office was furnished with all the\nluxury that suited his new position. I dropped into a deeply upholstered\nchair at the side of his mahogany desk, and, for the space of several\nminutes, Hart regarded me with concern, speaking not a word.\n\n\"Jack, old man,\" he finally ventured. \"I can't talk to you of this\nthing. But it makes me feel very badly to see you take it so hard. There\nare many things you have to live for, old top, and it is to talk about\nthese that I sent for you.\"\n\n\"You mean work?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes. That is the best thing for us all, in any emergency or under any\ncircumstances whatever. Preston wants you back for one thing, and he\nauthorized me to tell you that the job of office manager is waiting for\nyou at double your former salary.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy eyes misted at this. Preston was a good old scout! But I could never\nbear it to return to the old surroundings, even in the city. \"No, Hart,\"\nI said, \"I'd rather be away from New York and from that part of the\ncountry. Associations, you know.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" he replied, \"and that is just what I had hoped you would\ndecide. Because I have a job for you in the Air Service. A good one,\ntoo.\n\n\"You know there is much reconstruction work to be done on earth. More\nthan forty cities and towns have been wiped out of existence and these\nmust be rebuilt. That will occupy the minds and energies of thousands\nwho have been bereaved as you have. But, in the Air Service, we have a\nprogram that I believe will be more to your liking. The log of the\n_Terror_, in Oradel's handwriting, was found intact, as were a number of\nmanuscripts pertaining to plans of the Venerians.\n\n\"These misshapen creatures were quite evidently educated by Oradel to a\nhatred of our world. We have reason to believe that other attacks may\nfollow, for they were obviously intending to migrate here in millions.\nAnd, according to records found aboard the _Terror_, they are of\nadvanced scientific accomplishment. We may expect them to construct\nother vessels similar to the _Terror_ and to come here again. We must be\nprepared to fight them off, to carry the war to their own planet if\nnecessary. My work is to organize a world fleet of space ships for this\npurpose, and I'd like you to help me in this. The work will take you all\nover the world and will keep you too busy to think about--things.\"\n\nIt was just like Hart, and I thanked him wordlessly, but from the bottom\nof my heart. Yes, I would accept his generous offer. Though I was no\nengineer, I had a knowledge of scientific subjects a little above the\naverage, and I could follow instructions. By George, it was the very\nthing! Suddenly I grew enthusiastic.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was the sound of voices in the outer office, and Hart's secretary\nentered to announce the arrival of George Boehm and Professor Lindquist.\nThis was great!\n\nChubby George, red-faced and smiling as ever, embraced me with one short\narm and pounded me on the back with his other fist in his jovial, joking\nmanner. It was good to have friends like these! The professor held forth\nhis hand timidly. He was thinking of that tackle and the half-Nelson he\nhad used on me while the doctor slipped that needle into my arm back\nthere in Houston.\n\n\"Don't remove your glasses, Professor,\" I laughed; \"I'm not going to hit\nyou. That was a swell tackle of yours, and you did me a big service down\nthere in the Rice Hotel.\"\n\nHe beamed with pleasure and gripped my hand--mightily, for such a little\nfellow. George was whispering to Hart, and I could see that they were\ngreatly excited over something.\n\n\"Jack,\" said Hart, when the professor and I finished talking things\nover, \"George here wants you to take a little trip over to Philly with\nhim. He has something there he wants to show you.\"\n\nI looked from one to the other for signs of a hoax. These two, under\nnormal circumstances, were always up to something. But what I saw in\ntheir expressions convinced me that I had better go, and somehow, there\nrose in my breast a forlorn hope.\n\n\"All right,\" I agreed. \"Let's go!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOnce more we four took off together, this time in a speedy little\nfirst-level cabin plane of Hart's design, piloted by the irrepressible\nGeorge. I was brimming with questions, but George kept up such a\nrunning fire of small talk that I was unable to get in a single word\nthroughout the short trip to the Quaker City. It was quite evident that\nsomething was in the wind.\n\nInstead of landing at the airport, George swung across the city and\ndropped to the roof landing space of a large building which I recognized\nas the Germantown Hospital. We had no sooner landed when I was rushed\nfrom the plane to the penthouse over the elevator shafts. We were soon\non the main floor and George went immediately to the desk at the\nreceiving office, where he engaged in earnest conversation with the\nnurse in charge.\n\n\"What are you doing--committing me?\" I asked, half joking only. For,\nfrom the mysterious expression of my friends' faces, I was not sure what\nto expect.\n\n\"No,\" laughed Hart. \"George learned of the existence of a patient here\nwho may turn out to be a very good friend of yours.\"\n\nI turned this over in my mind, which did not yet function quite\nnormally. A friend? Why, I had very few that could really be termed good\nfriends outside of those that accompanied me. It could mean but one\nthing. Possibly one of my children--or even my dear wife--might have\nescaped somehow. I followed in a daze as a white-capped and gowned nurse\nled us along the corridor and into a ward where there were dozens of\nhigh, white beds.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSome of the patients were swathed in bandages; some sat up in their\nbeds, reading or just staring; others lay inert and pale. The reek of\niodoform pervaded the large room.\n\nWe stopped at the bedside of one of the staring patients, a young woman\nwho looked unseeingly at our party. Great heavens, it was Marie!\n\nA physician stood at the other side of her bed, finger on her pulse. The\nothers drew back as I approached her side, raised her free hand to my\nlips and spoke to her.\n\n\"Marie, dear,\" I asked gently, forcing the lump from my throat as best I\ncould, \"don't you know me? It's Jack, Honey.\"\n\nThe fixed stare of the great blue eyes shifted in my direction. It\nseemed that they looked through and past me into some terrible realm\nwhere only horror held sway. She drew her hand from my grasp and passed\nit before those staring, unnatural eyes. There was an audible gulp from\nGeorge. But the doctor smiled encouragement to me. I tried once more.\n\n\"Marie,\" I said, \"where are Jim and Jackie?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe hand fluttered to her lap, where it lay, blue-veined and pitifully\nthin. The stare focussed on me, seemed to concentrate. Then the film was\ngone from the eyes and she saw--she knew me!\n\n\"Oh, Jack!\" she wailed, \"I have been away. Don't you know where they\nare?\"\n\nMy heart nearly stopped at this, but I sat on the edge of the bed and\ntook her in my arms, looking at the doctor for approval. He nodded his\nhead brightly and beckoned to the nurse.\n\n\"Bring the children,\" I heard him whisper.\n\nMy cup was full. But I must be calm for Marie's sake. She had closed her\neyes now and great tears coursed down her waxen cheeks. Her body shook\nwith sobs.\n\n\"She'll recover?\" I asked the doctor.\n\n\"You bet. Just an aggravated case of amnesia. Hasn't eaten. Didn't even\nknow her children. Cured now, but she'll need a few weeks to build up.\"\nHe snapped shut the lid of his watch.\n\nThose succinct sentences were the finest I had ever heard.\n\nMarie clung to me like an infant to its mother. Her sobs gradually\nceased and she looked into my eyes. Little Jim and Jack had come in and\nwere clamoring for recognition.\n\n\"Oh, Jack,\" Marie whispered, \"I'm so happy.\"\n\nShe relinquished me and turned her attention to the children. I saw that\nmy friends had left and that an orderly was placing screens about us. So\nI'll close the screen on the remainder of this most happy reunion.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was several days before I had the complete story. Being lonesome\nduring my absence when we were preparing for the voyage into space, and\nnot knowing just when I would return, Marie had packed a grip and taken\nthe train for Philadelphia, deciding to spend a few days with her Aunt\nMargaret, or at least to remain there with the children until I\nreturned.\n\nShe had boarded the train at Manhattan Transfer at about the time we\nreached the location of the _Terror_ and the train was just pulling out\nof the station when there came the first of the new attacks of the\nenemy. She thought that the pillar of fire rose from the approximate\nlocation of Rutherford, but was not sure until they reached Newark, when\nthe news was spread throughout the train by passengers who boarded it\nthere. She worried and cried over the loss of our little home and had\nworked herself into a state of extreme nervousness and near-hysteria by\nthe time they reached New Brunswick.\n\nThen, as the long train left New Brunswick, there was another attack,\nthis one on the town they had just left. The last two cars of the train\nwere blown from the track by the initial concussion, and the remainder\nof the train brought to a grinding, jerking stop that threw the\npassengers into a panic.\n\nAlready hysterical, Marie was in no condition to bear up under the\nshock, and the loss of memory followed. Jack and Jim clung to her, of\ncourse, and were taken to the Germantown Hospital with her when the\nwreck victims were transferred to that point. She had no identification\non her person, and it was by sheerest luck that George, who was visiting\na friend in the same hospital, chanced to see her and thought he\nrecognized her.\n\nThat was all of it, but to me it was more than enough. From the depths\nof despondency, I rose to the peaks of elation. It was true that we\nwould have to establish a new home, but this would be a joy as never\nbefore. Those I had given up as lost were restored to me and I was\ncontent. Hart would have to make some changes in the duties of that new\njob--the world travel was out of the picture. I had had my fill of\nadventure.\n\nBesides, the hot spell was over.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nThe Forgotten Planet\n\n_By Sewell Peaslee Wright_\n\n\nI have been asked to record, plainly and without prejudice, a brief\nhistory of the Forgotten Planet.\n\n[Sidenote: The authentic account of why cosmic man damned an outlaw\nworld to be, forever, a leper of Space.]\n\nThat this record, when completed, will be sealed in the archives of the\nInterplanetary Alliance and remain there, a secret and rather dreadful\nbit of history, is no concern of mine. I am an old man, well past the\ncentury mark, and what disposal is made of my work is of little\nimportance to me. I grow weary of life and living, which is good. The\nfear of death was lost when our scientists showed us how to live until\nwe grew weary of life. But I am digressing--an old man's failing.\n\n[Illustration: \"It's nothing. Close the exit; we depart at once.\"]\n\nThe Forgotten Planet was not always so named. The name that it once bore\nhad been, as every child knows, stricken from the records, actual and\nmental, of the Universe. It is well that evil should not be remembered.\nBut in order that this history may be clear in the centuries to come, my\nrecord should go back to beginnings.\n\nSo far as the Universe is concerned, the history of the Forgotten Planet\nbegins with the visit of the first craft ever to span the space between\nthe worlds: the crude, adventuresome _Edorn_, whose name, as well as\nthe names of the nine Zenians who manned her, occupy the highest places\nin the roll of honor of the Universe.\n\nAme Baove, the commander and historian of the _Edorn_, made but brief\ncomment on his stop at the Forgotten Planet. I shall record it in full:\n\n     \"We came to rest upon the surface of this, the fourth of the\n     planets visited during the first trip of the _Edorn_, eighteen\n     spaces before the height of the sun. We found ourselves surrounded\n     immediately by vast numbers of creatures very different from\n     ourselves, and from their expressions and gestures, we gathered\n     that they were both curious and unfriendly.\n\n     \"Careful analysis of the atmosphere proved it to be sufficiently\n     similar to our own to make it possible for us to again stretch our\n     legs outside the rather cramped quarters of the _Edorn_, and tread\n     the soil of still another world.\n\n     \"No sooner had we emerged, however, than we were angrily beset by\n     the people of this unfriendly planet, and rather than do them\n     injury, we retired immediately, and concluded our brief\n     observations through our ports.\n\n     \"The topography of this planet is similar to our own, save that\n     there are no mountains, and the flora is highly colored almost\n     without exception, and apparently quite largely parasitical in\n     nature. The people are rather short in stature, with hairless heads\n     and high foreheads. Instead of being round or oval, however, the\n     heads of these people rise to a rounded ridge which runs back from\n     a point between and just above the eyes, nearly to the nape of the\n     neck behind. They give evidence of a fair order of intelligence,\n     but are suspicious and unfriendly. From the number and size of the\n     cities we saw, this planet is evidently thickly populated.\n\n     \"We left about sixteen spaces before the height of the sun, and\n     continued towards the fifth and last planet before our return to\n     Zenia.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis report, quite naturally, caused other explorers in space to\nhesitate. There were so many friendly, eager worlds to visit, during the\nyears that relations between the planets were being established, that an\nunfriendly people were ignored.\n\nHowever, from time to time, as space-ships became perfected and more\ncommon, parties from many of the more progressive planets did call. Each\nof them met with the same hostile reception, and at last, shortly after\nthe second War of the Planets, the victorious Alliance sent a fleet of\nthe small but terrible Deuber Spheres, convoyed by four of the largest\nof the disintegrator ray-ships, to subjugate the Forgotten Planet.\n\nFive great cities were destroyed, and the Control City, the seat of the\ngovernment, was menaced before the surly inhabitants conceded allegiance\nto the Alliance. Parties of scientists, fabricators, and workmen were\nthen landed, and a dictator was appointed.\n\nFrom all the worlds of the Alliance, instruments and equipment were\nbrought to the Forgotten Planet. A great educational system was planned\nand executed, the benign and kindly influence of the Alliance made every\neffort to improve the conditions existing on the Forgotten Planet, and\nto win the friendship and allegiance of these people.\n\nFor two centuries the work went on. Two centuries of bloodshed, strife,\nhate and disturbance. No where else within the known Universe was there\nill feeling. The second awful War of the Planets had at last succeeded\nin teaching the lesson of peace.\n\nTwo centuries of effort--wasted effort. It was near the end of the\nsecond century that my own story begins.\n\nCommander at that time of the super-cruiser _Tamon_, a Special Patrol\nship of the Alliance, I was not at all surprised to receive orders from\nthe Central Council to report at emergency speed. Special Patrol work in\nthose days, before the advent of the present de-centralized system, was\na succession of false starts, hurried recalls, and urgent, emergency\norders.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI obeyed at once. In the Special Patrol service, there is no questioning\norders. The planet Earth, from which I sprang, is and always has been\nproud of the fact that from the very beginning, her men have been picked\nto command the ships of the Special Patrol. No matter how dangerous, how\nforlorn and hopeless the mission given to a commander of a Special\nPatrol ship, history has never recorded that any commander has ever\nhesitated. That is why our uniform of blue and silver commands the\nrespect that it does even in this day and age of softening and\ndecadence, when men--but again an old man digresses. And perhaps it is\nnot for me to judge.\n\nI pointed the blunt nose of the _Tamon_ at Zenia, seat of the Central\nCouncil, and in four hours, Earth time, the great craft swept over the\ngleaming city of the Central Council and settled swiftly to the court\nbefore the mighty, columned Hall of the Planets.\n\nFour pages of the Council, in their white and scarlet livery, met me and\nconducted me instantly to a little anteroom behind the great council\nchamber.\n\nThere were three men awaiting me there; three men whose faces, at that\ntime, were familiar to every person in the known Universe.\n\nKellen, the oldest of the three, and the spokesman, rose as I entered\nthe room. The others did likewise, as the pages closed the heavy doors\nbehind me.\n\n\"You are prompt, and that is good,\" thought Kellen. \"I welcome you.\nRemove now thy menore.\"\n\nI glanced up at him swiftly. This must surely be an important matter,\nthat I was asked to remove my menore band.\n\nIt will, of course, be understood that at that time we had but a bulky\nand clumsy instrument to enable us to convey and receive thought; a\ndevice consisting of a heavy band of metal, in which were imbedded the\nnecessary instruments and a tiny atomic energy generator, the whole\nbeing worn as a circlet or crown upon the head.\n\nWonderingly, I removed my menore, placed it upon the long, dark table\naround which the three men were standing, and bowed. Each of the three,\nin turn, lifted their gleaming circlets from their heads, and placed\nthem likewise upon the table before them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You wonder,\" said Kellen, speaking of course, in the soft and liquid\nuniversal language, which is, I understand, still disseminated in our\nschools, as it should be. \"I shall explain as quickly and as briefly as\npossible.\n\n\"We have called you here on a dangerous mission. A mission that will\nrequire tact and quickness of mind as well as bravery. We have selected\nyou, have called you, because we are agreed that you possess the\nqualities required. Is it not so?\" He glanced at his two companions, and\nthey nodded gravely, solemnly, without speaking.\n\n\"You are a young man, John Hanson,\" continued Kellen, \"but your record\nin your service is one of which you can be proud. We trust you--with\nknowledge that is so secret, so precious, that we must revert to speech\nin order to convey it; we dare not trust it, even in this protected and\nguarded place, to the menore's quicker but less discreet communication.\"\n\nHe paused for a moment, frowning thoughtfully as though dreading to\nbegin. I waited silently, and at last he spoke again.\n\n\"There is a world\"--and he named a name which I shall not repeat, the\nname of the Forgotten Planet--\"that is a festering sore upon the body of\nthe Universe. As you know, for two centuries we have tried to pass on to\nthese people an understanding of peace and friendship. I believe that\nnothing has been left undone. The Council and the forces behind it have\ndone everything within their power. And now--\"\n\nHe stopped again, and there was an expression of deepest pain written\nupon his wise and kindly face. The pause was for but an instant.\n\n\"And now,\" he went on firmly, \"it is at an end. Our work has been\nundone. Two centuries of effort--undone. They have risen in revolt, they\nhave killed all those sent by the Alliance of which this Council is the\ngoverning body and the mouthpiece, and they have sent us an ultimatum--a\nthreat of war!\"\n\n\"_What?_\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKellen nodded his magnificent old head gravely.\n\n\"I do not wonder that you start,\" he said heavily. \"War! It must not be.\nIt cannot be! And yet, war is what they threaten.\"\n\n\"But, sir!\" I put in eagerly. I was young and rash in those days. \"Who\nare they, to make war against a united Universe?\"\n\n\"I have visited your planet, Earth,\" said Kellen, smiling very faintly.\n\"You have a tiny winged insect you call _bee_. Is it not so?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"The bee is a tiny thing, of little strength. A man, a little child,\nmight crush one to death between a thumb and finger. But the bee may\nsting before he is crushed, and the sting may linger on for days, a\npainful and unpleasant thing. Is that not so?\"\n\n\"I see, sir,\" I replied, somewhat abashed before the tolerant, kindly\nwisdom of this great man. \"They cannot hope to wage successful war, but\nthey may bring much suffering to others.\"\n\n\"Much suffering,\" nodded Kellen, still gently smiling. \"And we are\ndetermined that this thing shall not be. Not\"--and his face grew gray\nwith a terrible and bitter resolve--\"not if we have to bring to bear\nupon that dark and unwilling world the disintegrating rays of every ship\nof the Alliance, so that the very shell of the planet shall disappear,\nand no life ever again shall move upon its surface.\n\n\"But this,\" and he seemed to shudder at the thought, \"is a terrible and\na ruthless thing to even contemplate. We must first try once again to\npoint out to them the folly of their ways. It is with this mission that\nwe would burden you, John Hanson.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It is no burden, but an honor, sir,\" I said quietly.\n\n\"Youth! Youth!\" Kellen chided me gently. \"Foolish, yet rather glorious.\nLet me tell you the rest, and then we shall ask for your reply again.\n\n\"The news came to us by a small scout ship attached to that unhappy\nworld. It barely made the journey to Jaron, the nearest planet, and\ncrashed so badly, from lack of power, that all save one man were killed.\n\n\"He, luckily, tore off his menore, and insisted in speech that he be\nbrought here. He was obeyed, and, in a dying condition, was brought to\nthis very chamber.\" Kellen glanced swiftly, sadly, around the room, as\nthough he could still visualize that scene.\n\n\"Every agent of the Alliance upon that hateful planet was set upon and\nkilled, following the working out of some gigantic and perfectly\nexecuted plan--all save the crew of this one tiny scout ship, which was\nspared to act as a messenger.\n\n\"'Tell your great Council,' was the message these people sent to us,\n'that here is rebellion. We do not want, nor will we tolerate, your\npeace. We have learned now that upon other worlds than ours there are\ngreat riches. These we shall take. If there is resistance, we have a\nnew and a terrible death to deal. A death that your great scientists\nwill be helpless against; a horrible and irresistable death that will\nmake desolate and devoid of intelligent life any world where we are\nforced to sow the seeds of ultimate disaster.\n\n\"'We are not yet ready. If we were, we would not move, for we prefer\nthat your Council have time to think about what is surely to come. If\nyou doubt that we have the power to do what we have threatened to do,\nsend one ship, commanded by a man whose word you will trust, and we will\nprove to him that these are no empty words.'\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"That, as nearly as I can remember it,\" concluded Kellen, \"is the\nmessage. The man who brought it died almost before he had finished.\n\n\"That is the message. You are the man we have picked to accept their\nchallenge. Remember, though, that there are but the four of us in this\nroom. There are but four of us who know these things. If you for any\nreason do not wish to accept this mission, there will be none to judge\nyou, least of all, any one of us, who know best of all the perils.\"\n\n\"You say, sir,\" I said quietly, although my heart was pounding in my\nthroat, and roaring in my ears, \"that there would be none to judge me.\n\n\"Sir, there would be myself. There could be no more merciless judge. I\nam honored that I have been selected for this task, and I accept the\nresponsibility willingly, gladly. When is it your wish that we should\nstart?\"\n\nThe three presiding members of the Council glanced at each other,\nfaintly smiling, as though they would say, as Kellen had said a short\ntime before: \"Youth! Youth!\" Yet I believe they were glad and somewhat\nproud that I had replied as I did.\n\n\"You may start,\" said Kellen, \"as soon as you can complete the necessary\npreparations. Detailed instructions will be given you later.\"\n\nHe bowed to me, and the others did likewise. Then Kellen picked up his\nmenore and adjusted it.\n\nThe interview was over.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What do you make it?\" I asked the observer. He glanced up from his\ninstrument.\n\n\"Jaron, sir. Three degrees to port; elevation between five and six\ndegrees. Approximate only, of course, sir.\"\n\n\"Good enough. Please ask Mr. Barry to hold to his present course. We\nshall not stop at Jaron.\"\n\nThe observer glanced at me curiously, but he was too well disciplined to\nhesitate or ask questions.\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" he said crisply, and spoke into the microphone beside him.\n\nNone of us wore menores when on duty, for several reasons. Our\ninstruments were not nearly as perfect as those in use to-day, and\nverbal orders were clearer and carried more authority than mental\ninstructions. The delicate and powerful electrical and atomic mechanism\nof our ship interfered with the functioning of the menores, and at that\ntime the old habit of speech was far more firmly entrenched, due to\nhereditary influence, than it is now.\n\nI nodded to the man, and made my way to my own quarters. I wished most\nheartily that I could talk over my plans with someone, but this had been\nexpressly forbidden.\n\n\"I realize that you trust your men, and more particularly your\nofficers,\" Kellen had told me during the course of his parting\nconversation with me. \"I trust them also--yet we must remember that the\npeace of mind of the Universe is concerned. If news, even a rumor, of\nthis threatened disaster should become known, it is impossible to\npredict the disturbance it might create.\n\n\"Say nothing to anyone. It is your problem. You alone should leave the\nship when you land; you alone shall hear or see the evidence they have\nto present, and you alone shall bring word of it to us. That is the wish\nof the Council.\"\n\n\"Then it is my wish,\" I had said, and so it had been settled.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAft, in the crew's quarters, a gong sounded sharply: the signal for\nchanging watches, and the beginning of a sleep period. I glanced at the\nremote control dials that glowed behind their glass panel on one side of\nmy room. From the registered attraction of Jaron, at our present speed,\nwe should be passing her within, according to Earth time, about two\nhours. That meant that their outer patrols might be seeking our\nbusiness, and I touched Barry's attention button, and spoke into the\nmicrophone beside my bunk.\n\n\"Mr. Barry? I am turning in for a little sleep. Before you turn over the\nwatch to Eitel, will you see that the nose rays are set for the Special\nPatrol code signal for this enar. We shall be close to Jaron shortly.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir! Any other orders?\"\n\n\"No. Keep her on her present course. I shall take the watch from Mr.\nEitel.\"\n\nSince there have been changes since those days, and will undoubtedly be\nothers in the future, it might be well to make clear, in a document such\nis this, that at this period, all ships of the Special Patrol Service\nidentified themselves by means of invisible rays flashed in certain\nsequences, from the two nose, or forward, projectors. These code signals\nwere changed every enar, a period of time arbitrarily set by the\nCouncil; about eighteen days, as time is measured on the Earth, and\ndivided into ten periods, as at present, known as enarens. These were\nfurther divided into enaros, thus giving us a time-reckoning system for\nuse in space, corresponding roughly to the months, days and hours of the\nEarth.\n\nI retired, but not to sleep. Sleep would not come. I knew, of course,\nthat if curious outer patrol ships from Jaron did investigate us, they\nwould be able to detect our invisible ray code signal, and thus satisfy\nthemselves that we were on the Council's business. There would be no\ndifficulty on that score. But what I should do after landing upon the\nrebellious sphere, I had not the slightest idea.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Be stern, indifferent to their threats,\" Kellen, had counseled me, \"but\ndo everything within your power to make them see the folly of their\nattitude. Do not threaten them, for they are a surly people and you\nmight precipitate matters. Swallow your pride if you must; remember that\nyours is a gigantic responsibility, and upon the information you bring\nus may depend the salvation of millions. I am convinced that they are\nnot--you have a word in your language that fits exactly. Not pretending\n... what is the word?\"\n\n\"Bluffing?\" I had supplied in English, smiling.\n\n\"Right! Bluffing. It is a very descriptive word. I am sure they are not\nbluffing.\"\n\nI was sure of it also. They knew the power of the Alliance; they had\nbeen made to feel it more than once. A bluff would have been a foolish\nthing, and these people were not fools. In some lines of research they\nwere extraordinarily brilliant.\n\nBut what could their new, terrible weapon be? Rays we had; at least half\na dozen rays of destruction; the terrible dehydrating ray of the Deuber\nSpheres, the disintegrating ray that dated back before Ame Baove and his\nfirst voyage into space, the concentrated ultra-violet ray that struck\nmen down in fiery torment.... No, it could hardly be a new ray that was\ntheir boasted weapon.\n\nWhat, then? Electricity had even then been exhausted of its\npossibilities. Atomic energy had been released, harnessed, and directed.\nYet it would take fabulous time and expense to make these machines of\ndestruction do what they claimed they would do.\n\nStill pondering the problem, I did fall at last into a fitful travesty\nof sleep.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was glad when the soft clamor of the bell aft announced the next\nchange of watch. I rose, cleared the cobwebs from my brain with an icy\nshower, and made my way directly to the navigating room.\n\n\"Everything tidy, sir,\" said Eitel, my second officer, and a Zenian. He\nwas thin and very dark, like all Zenians, and had the high, effeminate\nvoice of that people. But he was cool and fearless and had the uncanny\ncerebration of his kind; I trusted him as completely as I trusted Barry,\nmy first officer, who, like myself, was a native of Earth. \"Will you\ntake over?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I nodded, glancing at the twin charts beneath the ground glass\ntop of the control table. \"Get what sleep you can the next few enaros.\nPresently I shall want every man on duty and at his station.\"\n\nHe glanced at me curiously, as the observer had done, but saluted and\nleft with only a brief, \"Yes, sir!\" I returned the salute and turned my\nattention again to the charts.\n\nThe navigating room of an interplanetary ship is without doubt\nunfamiliar ground to most, so it might be well for me to say that such\nships have, for the most part, twin charts, showing progress in two\ndimensions; to use land terms, lateral and vertical. These charts are\nreally no more than large sheets of ground glass, ruled in both\ndirections with fine black lines, representing all relatively close\nheavenly bodies by green lights of varying sizes. The ship itself is\nrepresented by a red spark and the whole is, of course, entirely\nautomatic in action, the instruments comprising the chart being operated\nby super-radio reflexes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJaron, the charts showed me at a glance, was now far behind. Almost\ndirectly above--it is necessary to resort to these unscientific terms to\nmake my meaning clear--was the tiny world Elon, home of the friendly but\nimpossibly dull winged people, the only ones in the known Universe. I\nwas there but once, and found them almost laughably like our common\ndragon-flies on Earth; dragon-flies that grow some seven feet long, and\nwith gauzy wings of amazing strength.\n\nDirectly ahead, on both charts, was a brilliantly glowing sphere of\ngreen--our destination. I made some rapid mental calculations, studying\nthe few fine black lines between the red spark that was our ship, and\nthe nearest edge of the great green sphere. I glanced at our speed\nindicator and the attraction meter. The little red slide that moved\naround the rim of the attraction meter was squarely at the top, showing\nthat the attraction was from straight ahead; the great black hand was\nnearly a third of the way around the face.\n\nWe were very close; two hours would bring us into the atmospheric\nenvelope. In less than two hours and a half, we would be in the Control\nCity of what is now called the Forgotten Planet!\n\nI glanced forward, through the thick glass partitions, into the\noperating room. Three men stood there, watching intently; they too, were\nwondering why we visited the unfriendly world.\n\nThe planet itself loomed up straight ahead, a great half-circle, its\ncurved rim sharp and bright against the empty blackness of space; the\nchord ragged and blurred. In two hours ... I turned away and began a\nrestless pacing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAn hour went by; an hour and a half. I pressed the attention button to\nthe operating room, and gave orders to reduce our speed by half. We were\nvery close to the outer fringe of the atmospheric envelope. Then,\nkeeping my eye on the big surface-temperature gauge, with its stubby red\nhand, I resumed my nervous pacing.\n\nSlowly the thick red hand of the surface-temperature gauge began to\nmove; slowly, and then more rapidly, until the eyes could catch its\ncreeping.\n\n\"Reduce to atmospheric speed,\" I ordered curtly, and glanced down\nthrough a side port at one end of the long navigating room.\n\nWe were, at the moment, directly above the twilight belt. To my right,\nas I looked down, I could see a portion of the glistening antarctic ice\ncap. Here and there were the great flat lakes, almost seas, of the\nplanet.\n\nOur geographies of the Universe to-day do not show the topography of\nthe Forgotten Planet: I might say, therefore, that the entire sphere was\nland area, with numerous great lakes embedded in its surface, together\nwith many broad, very crooked rivers. As Ame Baove had reported, there\nwere no mountains, and no high land.\n\n\"Altitude constant,\" I ordered. \"Port three degrees. Stand by for\nfurther orders.\"\n\nThe earth seemed to whirl slowly beneath us. Great cities drifted\nastern, and I compared the scene below me with the great maps I took\nfrom our chart-case. The Control City should be just beyond the visible\nrim; well in the daylight area.\n\n\"Port five degrees,\" I said, and pressed the attention button to Barry's\nquarters.\n\n\"Mr. Barry, please call all men to quarters, including the off-duty\nwatch, and then report to the navigating room. Mr. Eitel will be under\nmy direct orders. We shall descend within the next few minutes.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir.\"\n\nI pressed the attention button to Eitel's room.\n\n\"Mr. Eitel, please pick ten of your best men and have them report at the\nforward exit. Await me, with the men, at that place. I shall be with you\nas soon as I turn the command over to Mr. Barry. We are descending\nimmediately.\"\n\n\"Right, sir!\" said Eitel.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI turned from the microphone to find that Barry had just entered the\nnavigating room.\n\n\"We will descend into the Great Court of the Control City, Mr. Barry,\"\nI said. \"I have a mission here. I am sorry, but these are the only\ninstructions I can leave you.\n\n\"I do not know how long I shall be gone from the ship, but if I do not\nreturn within three hours, depart without me, and report directly to\nKellen of the Council. To him, and no other. Tell him, verbally, what\ntook place. Should there be any concerted action against the _Tamon_,\nuse your own judgment as to the action to be taken, remembering that the\nsafety of the ship and its crew, and the report of the Council, are\ninfinitely more important than my personal welfare. Is that clear?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Too damned clear.\"\n\nI smiled and shook my head.\n\n\"Don't worry,\" I said lightly. \"I'll be back well within the appointed\ntime.\"\n\n\"I hope so. But there's something wrong as hell here. I'm talking now as\nman to man; not to my commanding officer. I've been watching below, and\nI have seen at least two spots where large numbers of our ships have\nbeen destroyed. The remaining ships bear their own damned emblem where\nthe crest of the Alliance should be--and was. What does it mean?\"\n\n\"It means,\" I said slowly, \"that I shall have to rely upon every man and\nofficer to forget himself and myself, and obey orders without hesitation\nand without flinching. The orders are not mine, but direct from the\nCouncil itself.\" I held out my hand to him--an ancient Earth gesture of\ngreeting, good-will and farewell--and he shook it vigorously.\n\n\"God go with you,\" he said softly, and with a little nod of thanks I\nturned and quickly left the room.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEitel, with his ten men, were waiting for me at the forward exit. The\nmen fell back a few paces and came to attention; Eitel saluted smartly.\n\n\"We are ready, sir. What are your orders?\"\n\n\"You are to guard this opening. Under no circumstances is anyone to\nenter save myself. I shall be gone not longer than three hours; if I am\nnot back within that time, Mr. Barry has his orders. The exit will be\nsealed, and the _Tamon_ will depart immediately, without me.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. You will pardon me, but I gather that your mission is a\ndangerous one. May I not accompany you?\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"I shall need you here.\"\n\n\"But, sir, they are very excited and angry; I have been watching them\nfrom the observation ports. And there is a vast crowd of them around the\nship.\"\n\n\"I had expected that. I thank you for your concern, but I must go alone.\nThose are the orders. Will you unseal the exit?\"\n\nHis \"Yes, sir!\" was brisk and efficient, but there was a worried frown\non his features as he unlocked and released the switch that opened the\nexit.\n\nThe huge plug of metal, some ten feet in diameter, revolved swiftly and\nnoiselessly, backing slowly in its fine threads into the interior of the\nship, gripped by the ponderous gimbals which, as the last threads\ndisengaged, swung the mighty disc to one side, like the door of some\ngreat safe.\n\n\"Remember your orders,\" I smiled, and with a little gesture to convey an\nassurance which I certainly did not feel, I strode through the circular\nopening out into the crowd. The heavy glass secondary door shot down\nbehind me, and I was in the hands of the enemy.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe first thing I observed was that my menore, which I had picked up on\nmy way to the exit, was not functioning. Not a person in all that vast\nmultitude wore a menore; the five black-robed dignitaries who marched to\nmeet me wore none.\n\nNothing could have showed more clearly that I was in for trouble. To\ninvite a visitor, as Kellen had done, to remove his menore first, was,\nof course, a polite and courteous thing to do if one wished to\ncommunicate by speech; to remove the menore before greeting a visitor\nwearing one, was a tacit admission of rank enmity; a confession that\none's thoughts were to be concealed.\n\nMy first impulse was to snatch off my own instrument and fling it in the\nsolemn, ugly faces of the nearest of the five dignataries; I remembered\nKellen's warning just in time. Quietly, I removed the metal circlet and\ntucked it under my arm, bowing slightly to the committee of five as I\ndid so.\n\n\"I am Ja Ben,\" said the first of the five, with an evil grin. \"You are\nthe representative of the Council that we commanded to appear?\"\n\n\"I am John Hanson, commander of the ship _Tamon_ of the Special Patrol\nService. I am here to represent the Central Council,\" I replied with\ndignity.\n\n\"As we commanded,\" grinned Ja Ben. \"That is good. Follow us and you\nshall have the evidence you were promised.\"\n\nJa Ben led the way with two of his black-robed followers. The other two\nfell in behind me. A virtual prisoner, I marched between them, through\nthe vast crowd that made way grudgingly to let us pass.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI have seen the people of most of the planets of the known Universe.\nMany of them, to Earth notions, are odd. But these people, so much like\nus in many respects, were strangely repulsive.\n\nTheir heads, as Ame Baove had recorded, were not round like ours, but\npossessed a high bony crest that ran from between their lashless,\nbrowless eyes, down to the very nape of their necks. Their skin, even\nthat covering their hairless heads, was a dull and papery white, like\nparchment, and their eyes were abnormally small, and nearly round. A\nhateful, ugly people, perpetually scowling, snarling; their very voices\nresembled more the growl of wild beasts than the speech of intelligent\nbeings.\n\nJa Ben led the way straight to the low but vast building of dun-colored\nstone that I knew was the administration building of the Control City.\nWe marched up the broad, crowded steps, through the muttering, jeering\nmultitude into the building itself. The guards at the doors stood aside\nto let us through and the crowd at last was left behind.\n\nA swift, cylindrical elevator shot us upward, into a great glass-walled\nlaboratory, built like a sort of penthouse on the roof. Ja Ben walked\nquickly across the room towards a long, glass-topped table; the other\nfour closed in on me silently but suggestively.\n\n\"That is unnecessary,\" I said quietly. \"See, I am unarmed and completely\nin your power. I am here as an ambassador of the Central Council, not as\na warrior.\"\n\n\"Which is as well for you,\" grinned Ja Ben. \"What I have to show you,\nyou can see quickly, and then depart.\"\n\nFrom a great cabinet in one corner of the room he took a shining\ncylinder of dark red metal, and held it up before him, stroking its\nsleek sides with an affectionate hand.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Here it is,\" he said, chuckling. \"The secret of our power. In here,\nsafely imprisoned now, but capable of being released at our command, is\ndeath for every living thing upon any planet we choose to destroy.\" He\nreplaced the great cylinder in the cabinet, and picked up in its stead a\ntiny vial of the same metal, no larger than my little finger, and not so\nlong. \"Here,\" he said, turning again towards me, \"is the means of\nproving our power to you. Come closer!\"\n\nWith my bodyguard of four watching every move, I approached.\n\nJa Ben selected a large hollow hemisphere of crystal glass and placed it\nupon a smooth sheet of flat glass. Next he picked a few blossoms from a\nbowl that stood, incongruously enough, on the table, and threw them\nunder the glass hemisphere.\n\n\"Flora,\" he grinned.\n\nHurrying to the other end of the room, he reached into a large flat\nmetal cage and brought forth three small rodent like animals, natives of\nthat world. These he also tossed carelessly under the glass.\n\n\"Fauna,\" he grunted, and picked up the tiny metal vial.\n\nOne end of the vial unscrewed. He turned the cap gently, carefully, a\nstrained, anxious look upon his face. My four guards watched him\nbreathlessly, fearfully.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe cap came loose at last, disclosing the end of the tube, sealed with\na grayish substance that looked like wax. Very quickly Ja Ben rolled the\nlittle cylinder under the glass hemisphere, and picked up a beaker that\nhad been bubbling gently on an electric plate close by. Swiftly he\npoured the thick contents of the beaker around the base of the glass\nbell. The stuff hardened almost instantly, forming an air-tight seal\nbetween the glass hemisphere and the flat plate of glass upon which it\nrested. Then, with an evil, triumphant smile, Ja Ben looked up.\n\n\"_Flora_,\" he repeated. \"_Fauna._ And _death_. Watch! The little metal\ncylinder is plugged still, but in a moment that plug will\ndisappear--simply a volatile solid, you understand. It is going rapidly\n... rapidly ... it is almost gone now! Watch ... In an instant now ...\n_ah!_\"\n\nI saw the gray substance that stopped the entrance of the little metal\nvial disappear. The rodents ran around and over it, trying to find a\ncrevice by which they might escape. The flowers, bright and beautiful,\nlay untidily on the bottom of the glass prison.\n\nThen, just as the last vestige of the gray plug vanished; an amazing, a\nterrible thing happened. At the mouth of the tiny metal vial a greenish\ncloud appeared. I call it a cloud, but it was not that. It was solid,\nand it spread in every direction, sending out little needles that lashed\nabout and ran together into a solid mass while millions of little\nneedles reached out swiftly.\n\nOne of these little needles touched a scurrying animal. Instantly the\ntiny brute stiffened, and from his entire body the greenish needles\nspread swiftly. One of the flowers turned suddenly thick and pulpy with\nthe soft green mass, then another, another of the rodents ... _God!_\n\nIn the space of two heart beats, the entire hemisphere was filled with\nthe green mass, that still moved and writhed and seemed to press against\nthe glass sides as though the urge to expand was insistent,\nimperative....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What is it?\" I whispered, still staring at the thing.\n\n\"_Death!_\" grunted Ja Ben, thrusting his hateful face close to mine, his\ntiny round eyes, with their lashless lids glinting. \"Death, my friend.\nGo and tell your great Council of this death that we have created for\nevery planet that will not obey us.\n\n\"We have gone back into the history of dealing death and have come back\nwith a death such as the Universe has never known before!\n\n\"Here is a rapacious, deadly fungus we have been two centuries in\ndeveloping. The spores contained in that tiny metal tube would be\ninvisible to the naked eye--and yet given but a little time to grow,\nwith air and vegetation and flesh to feed upon, and even that small\ncapsule would wipe out a world. And in the cabinet,\"--he pointed\ngrinning triumphantly--\"we have, ready for instant use, enough of the\nspores of this deadly fungas to wipe out all the worlds of your great\nAlliance.\n\n\"To wipe them out utterly!\" he repeated, his voice shaking with a sort\nof frenzy now. \"Every living thing upon their faces, wrapped in that\nthin, hungry green stuff you see there under that glass. All life wiped\nout; made uninhabitable so long as the Universe shall endure. And\nwe--_we_ shall be rulers, unquestioned, of that Universe. Tell your\ndoddering Council _that_!\" He leaned back against the table, panting\nwith hate.\n\n\"I shall tell them all I have seen; all you have said,\" I nodded.\n\n\"You believe we have the power to do all this?\"\n\n\"I do--God help me, and the Universe,\" I said solemnly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was no doubt in my mind. I could see all too clearly how well\ntheir plans had been laid; how quickly this hellish growth would\nstrangle all life, once its spores began to develop.\n\nThe only possible chance was to get back to the Council and make my\nreport, with all possible speed, so that every available armed ship of\nthe universe might concentrate here, and wipe out these people before\nthey had time to--\n\n\"I know what you are thinking, my friend,\" broke in Ja Ben mockingly.\n\"You might as well have worn the menore! You would have the ships of the\nAlliance destroy us before we have time to act. We had foreseen that,\nand have provided for the possibility.\n\n\"As soon as you leave here, ships, provided with many tubes like the one\njust used for our little demonstration, will be dispersed in every\ndirection. We shall be in constant communication with those ships, and\nat the least sign of hostility, they will be ordered to depart and\nspread their death upon every world they can reach. Some of them you may\nbe able to locate and eliminate; a number of them are certain to elude\ncapture in infinite space--and if only one, one lone ship, should\nescape, the doom of the Alliance and millions upon millions of people\nwill be pronounced.\n\n\"I warn you, it will be better, much better, to bow to our wishes, and\npay us the tribute we shall demand. Any attempt at resistance will\nprecipitate certain disaster for your Council and all the worlds the\nCouncil governs.\"\n\n\"At least, we would wipe you out first,\" I said hoarsely.\n\n\"True,\" nodded Ja Ben. \"But the vengeance of our ships would be a\nterrible thing! You would not dare to take the chance!\"\n\nI stood there, staring at him in a sort of daze. What he had said was so\ntrue; terribly, damnably true.\n\nIf only--\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was but one chance I could see, and desperate as it was, I took\nit. Whirling the heavy metal ring of my menore in my hand, I sprang\ntowards the table.\n\nIf I could break the sealed glass hemisphere, and loose the fungus upon\nits creators; deal to them the doom they had planned for the universe,\nthen perhaps all might yet be well.\n\nJa Ben understood instantly what was in my mind. He and his four aides\nleaped between me and the table, their tiny round eyes blazing with\nanger. I struck one of the four viciously with the menore, and with a\ngasp he fell back and slumped to the floor.\n\nBefore I could break through the opening, however, Ja Ben struck me full\nin the face with his mighty fist; a blow that sent me, dazed and\nreeling, into a corner of the room. I brought up with a crash against\nthe cabinet there, groped wildly in an effort to steady myself, and fell\nto the floor. Almost before I struck, all four of them were upon me.\n\nThey hammered me viciously, shouted at me, cursed me in the universal\ntongue, but I paid no heed. I pretended to be unconscious, but my heart\nwas beating high with sudden, glorious hope, and in my brain a terrible,\nmerciless plan was forming.\n\nWhen I had groped against the cabinet in an effort to regain my balance,\nmy fingers had closed upon one of the little metal vials. As I fell, I\ncovered that hand with my body and hastily hid the tiny tube in a deep\npocket of my blue and silver Service uniform.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSlowly, after a few seconds, I opened my eyes and looked up at them,\nhelplessly.\n\n\"Go, now!\" snarled Ja Ben, dragging me to my feet. \"Go, and tell your\nCouncil we are more than a match for you--and for them.\" He thrust me,\nreeling, towards his three assistants. \"Take him to his ship, and send\naid for Ife Rance, here.\" He glanced at the still unconscious figure of\nthe victim of my menore, and then turned to me with a last warning.\n\n\"Remember, one thing more, my friend: you have disintegrator ray\nequipment upon your ship. You have the little atomic bombs that won for\nthe Alliance the Second War of the Planets. I know that. But if you make\nthe slightest effort to use them, I shall dispatch a supply of the green\ndeath to our ships, and they will depart upon their missions at once.\nYou would take upon yourself a terrible responsibility by making the\nsmallest hostile move.\n\n\"Go, now--and when you return, bring with you members of your great\nCouncil who will have the power to hear our demands, and see that they\nare obeyed. And do not keep us waiting over long, for we are an\nimpatient race.\" He bowed, mockingly, and passed his left hand swiftly\nbefore his face, his people's sign of parting.\n\nI nodded, not trusting myself to speak, and, hemmed in by my three\nblack-robed conductors, was hurried down the elevator and back through\nthe jeering mob to my ship.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe glass secondary door shot up to permit me to enter, and Eitel\ngripped my shoulder anxiously, his eyes smoldering angrily.\n\n\"You're hurt, sir!\" he said in his odd, high-pitched voice, staring into\nmy bruised face. \"What--\"\n\n\"It's nothing,\" I assured him. \"Close the exit immediately; we depart at\nonce.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" He closed the switch, and the great threaded plug swung\ngently on its gimbals and began to revolve, swiftly and silently. A\nlittle bell sounded sharply, and the great door ceased its motion. Eitel\nlocked the switch and returned the key to his pocket.\n\n\"Good. All men are at their stations?\" I asked briskly.\n\n\"Yes, sir! All except these ten, detailed to guard the exit.\"\n\n\"Have them report to their regular stations. Issue orders to the ray\noperators that they are to instantly, and without further orders,\ndestroy any ship that may leave the surface of this planet. Have every\natomic bomb crew ready for an instant and concentrated offensive\ndirected at the Control City, but command them not to act under any\ncircumstances unless I give the order. Is that clear, Mr. Eitel?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\"\n\nI nodded, and turned away, making my way immediately to the navigating\nroom.\n\n\"Mr. Barry,\" I said quickly and gravely, \"I believe that the fate of the\nknown Universe depends upon us at this moment. We will ascend\nvertically, at once--slowly--until we are just outside the envelope,\nmaintaining only sufficient horizontal motion to keep us directly over\nthe Control City. Will you give the necessary orders?\"\n\n\"Immediately, sir!\" He pressed the attention button to the operating\nroom and spoke swiftly into the microphone; before he completed the\norder I had left.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe were already ascending when I reached the port forward atomic bomb\nstation. The man in charge, a Zenian, saluted with automatic precision\nand awaited orders.\n\n\"You have a bomb in readiness?\" I asked, returning the salute.\n\n\"Those were my orders, sir.\"\n\n\"Correct. Remove it, please.\"\n\nI waited impatiently while the crew removed the bomb from the releasing\ntrap. It was withdrawn at last; a fish-shaped affair, very much like the\nancient airplane bombs save that it was no larger than my two fists,\nplaced one upon the other, and that it had four silvery wires running\nalong its sides, from rounded nose to pointed tail, held at a distance\nfrom the body by a series of insulating struts.\n\n\"Now,\" I said, \"how quickly can you put another object in the trap,\nre-seal the opening, and release the object?\"\n\n\"While the Commander counts ten with reasonable speed,\" said the Zenian\nwith pride. \"We won first honors in the Special Patrol Service contests\nat the last Examination, the Commander may remember.\"\n\n\"I do remember. That is why I selected you for this duty.\"\n\nWith hands that trembled a little, I think, I drew forth the little vial\nof gleaming red metal, while the bombing crew watched me curiously.\n\n\"I shall unscrew the cap from this little vial,\" I explained, \"and drop\nit immediately into the releasing trap. Re-seal the trap and release\nthis object as quickly as it is possible to do so. If you can better the\ntime you made to win the honors at the Examination--in God's name, do\nso!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" replied the Zenian. He gave brisk orders to his crew, and\neach of the three men sprang alertly into position.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs quickly as I could, I turned off the cap of the little metal vial and\ndropped it into the trap. The heavy plug, a tiny duplicate of the exit\ndoor, clicked shut upon it and spun, whining gently, into the opening.\nSomething clicked sharply, and one of the crew dropped a bar into place.\nAs it shot home, the Zenian in command of the crew pulled the release\nplunger.\n\n\"Done, sir!\" he said proudly.\n\nI did not reply. My eye fixed upon the observation tube that was\nfollowing the tiny missile to the ground.\n\nThe Control City was directly below us. I lost sight of the vial almost\ninstantly, but the indicating cross-hairs showed me exactly where the\nvial would strike; at a point approximately half way between the edge of\nthe city and the great squat pile of the administrating building, with\nits gleaming glass penthouse--the laboratory in which, only a few\nminutes before, I had witnessed the demonstration of the death which\nawaited the Universe.\n\n\"Excellent!\" I exclaimed. \"Smartly done, men!\" I turned and hurried to\nthe navigating room, where the most powerful of our television discs was\nlocated.\n\nThe disc was not as perfect as those we have to-day; it was hooded to\nkeep out exterior light, which is not necessary with the later\ninstruments, and it was more unwieldy. However, it did its work, and did\nit well, in the hands of an experienced operator.\n\nWith only a nod to Barry, I turned the range band to maximum, and\nbrought it swiftly to bear upon that portion of the city in which the\nlittle vial had fallen. As I drew the focusing lever towards me, the\nscene leaped at me through the clear, glowing glass disc.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFroth! Green, billowing froth that grew and boiled and spread\nunceasingly. In places it reached high into the air, and it moved with\nan eager, inner life that was somehow terrible and revolting. I moved\nthe range hand back, and the view seemed to drop away from me swiftly.\n\nI could see the whole city now. All one side of it was covered with the\nspreading green stain that moved and flowed so swiftly. Thousands of\ntiny black figures were running in the streets, crowding away from the\nawful danger that menaced them.\n\nThe green patch spread more swiftly always. When I had first seen it,\nthe edges were advancing as rapidly as a man could run; now they were\nfairly racing, and the speed grew constantly.\n\nA ship, two of them, three of them came darting from somewhere, towards\nthe administration building, with its glass cupola. I held my breath as\nthe deep, sudden humming from the _Tamon_ told me that our rays were\nbusy. Would they--\n\nOne of the enemy ships disappeared suddenly in a little cloud of dirty,\nheavy dust that settled swiftly. Another ... and the third. Three little\nstreaks of dust, falling, falling....\n\nA fourth ship, and a fifth came rushing up, their sides faintly glowing\nfrom the speed they had made. The green flood, thick and insistent, was\nracing up and over the administration building now. It reached the roof,\nran swiftly....\n\nThe fourth ship shattered into dust. The fifth settled swiftly--and then\nthat ship also disappeared, together with a corner of the building. Then\nthe thick green stuff flowed over the whole building and there was\nnothing to be seen there but a mound of soft, flowing, gray-green stuff\nthat rushed on now with the swiftness of the wind.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI looked up, into Barry's face.\n\n\"You're ill!\" he said quickly. \"Is there anything I can do, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, forming the words with difficulty. \"Give orders to ascend\nat emergency speed!\"\n\nFor once my first officer hesitated. He glanced at the attraction meter\nand then turned to me again, wondering.\n\n\"At this height, sir, emergency speed will mean dangerous heating of the\nsurface; perhaps--\"\n\n\"I want it white hot, Mr. Barry. She is built to stand it. Emergency\nspeed, please--immediately!\"\n\n\"Right, sir!\" he said briskly, and gave the order.\n\nI felt my weight increase as the order was obeyed; gradually the\nfamiliar, uncomfortable feeling left me. Silently, Barry and I watched\nthe big surface temperature gauge as it started to move. The heat inside\nbecame uncomfortable, grew intense. The sweat poured from us. In the\noperating room forward, I could see the men casting quick, wondering\nglances up at us through the heavy glass partition that lay between.\n\nThe thick, stubby red hand of the surface temperature gauge moved slowly\nbut steadily towards the heavy red line that marked the temperature at\nwhich the outer shell of our hull would become incandescent. The hand\nwas within three or four degrees of that mark when I gave Barry the\norder to arrest our motion.\n\nWhen he had given the order, I turned to him and motioned towards the\ntelevision disc.\n\n\"Look,\" I said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe looked, and when at last he tore his face away from the hood, he\nseemed ten years older.\n\n\"What is it?\" he asked in a choked whisper. \"Why--they're being wiped\nout; the whole of that world--\"\n\n\"True. And some of the seeds of that terrible death might have drifted\nupward, and found a lodging place upon the surface of our ship. That is\nwhy I ordered the emergency speed while we were still within the\natmospheric envelope, Barry. To burn away that contamination, if it\nexisted. Now we are safe, unless--\"\n\nI pressed the attention button to the station of the chief of the ray\noperators.\n\n\"Your report,\" I ordered.\n\n\"Nine ships disintegrated, sir,\" he replied instantly. \"Five before the\ncity was destroyed, four later.\"\n\n\"You are certain that none escaped?\"\n\n\"Positive, sir.\"\n\n\"Very good.\"\n\nI turned to Barry, smiling.\n\n\"Point her nose for Zenia, Mr. Barry,\" I said. \"As soon as it is\nfeasible, resume emergency speed. There are some very anxious gentlemen\nthere awaiting our report, and I dare not convey it except in person.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" said Barry crisply.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis, then, is the history of the Forgotten Planet. On the charts of the\nUniverse it appears as an unnamed world. No ship is permitted to pass\nclose enough to it so that its attraction is greater than that of the\nnearest other mass. A permanent outpost of fixed-station ships, with\nheadquarters upon Jaron, the closest world, is maintained by the\nCouncil.\n\nThere are millions of people who might be greatly disturbed if they knew\nof this potential menace that lurks in the midst of our Universe, but\nthey do not know. The wisdom of the Council made certain of that.\n\nBut, in order that in the ages to come there might be a record of this\nmatter, I have been asked to prepare this document for the sealed\narchives of the Alliance. It has been a pleasant task; I have relived,\nfor a little time, a part of my youth.\n\nThe work is done, now, and that is well. I am an old man, and weary.\nSometimes I wish I might live to see the wonders that the next\ngeneration or so will witness, but my years are heavy upon me.\n\nMy work is done.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nASTOUNDING STORIES\n\n_Appears on Newsstands_\n\nTHE FIRST THURSDAY IN EACH MONTH\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n[Illustration: \"_And I would have been the greatest man in the world._\"]\n\n\n\n\nThe Power and the Glory\n\n_By Charles W. Diffin_\n\n\nThere were papers on the desk, a litter of papers scrawled over, in the\ncareless writing of indifferent students, with the symbols of chemistry\nand long mathematical computations. The man at the desk pushed them\naside to rest his lean, lined face on one thin hand. The other arm,\nending at the wrist, was on the desk before him.\n\n[Sidenote: Sadly, sternly, the old professor reveals to his brilliant\npupil the greater path to glory.]\n\nStudents of a great university had long since ceased to speculate about\nthe missing hand. The result of an experiment, they knew--a hand that\nwas a mass of lifeless cells, amputated quickly that the living arm\nmight be saved--but that was some several years ago, ancient history to\nthose who came and went through Professor Eddinger's class room.\n\nAnd now Professor Eddinger was weary--weary and old, he told himself--as\nhe closed his eyes to shut out the sight of the interminable papers and\nthe stubby wrist that had ended forever his experiments and the delicate\nmanipulations which only he could do.\n\nHe reached slowly for a buzzing phone, but his eyes brightened at the\nvoice that came to him.\n\n\"I've got it--I've got it!\" The words were almost incoherent. \"This is\nAvery, Professor--Avery! You must come at once. You will share in it; I\nowe it all to you ... you will be the first to see ... I am sending a\ntaxi for you--\"\n\nProfessor Eddinger's tired eyes crinkled to a smile. Enthusiasm like\nthis was rare among his youngsters. But Avery--with the face of a poet,\na dreamer's eyes and the mind of a scientist--good boy, Avery!--a long\ntime since he had seen him--had him in his own laboratory for two\nyears....\n\n\"What's this all about?\" he asked.\n\n\"No--no!\" said a voice; \"I can't tell you--it is too big--greater than\nthe induction motor--greater than the electric light--it is the greatest\nthing in the world. The taxi should be there now--you must come--\"\n\nA knock at the office door where a voice said, \"Car for Professor\nEddinger,\" confirmed the excited words.\n\n\"I'll come,\" said the Professor, \"right away.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe pondered, as the car whirled him across the city, on what this\ngreatest thing in the world might be. And he hoped with gentle\nskepticism that the enthusiasm was warranted. A young man opened the car\ndoor as they stopped. His face was flushed, Eddinger noted, hair pushed\nback in disarray, his shirt torn open at the throat.\n\n\"Wait here,\" he told the driver and took the Professor by the arm to\nhurry him into a dilapidated building.\n\n\"Not much of a laboratory,\" he said, \"but we'll have better, you and I;\nwe'll have better--\"\n\nThe room seemed bare with its meager equipment, but it was neat, as\nbecame the best student of Professor Eddinger. Rows of reagent bottles\nstood on the shelves, but the tables were a litter of misplaced\ninstruments and broken glassware where trembling hands had fumbled in\nheedless excitement.\n\n\"Glad to see you again, Avery.\" The gentle voice of Professor Eddinger\nhad lost its tired tone. \"It's been two years you've been working, I\njudge. Now what is this great discovery, boy? What have you found?\"\n\nThe younger man, in whose face the color came and went, and whose eyes\nwere shining from dark hollows that marked long days and sleepless\nnights, still clung to the other's arm.\n\n\"It's real,\" he said; \"it's great! It means fortune and fame, and you're\nin on that, Professor. The old master,\" he said and clapped a hand\naffectionately upon a thin shoulder; \"I owe it all to you. And now I\nhave--I have learned.... No, you shall see for yourself. Wait--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe crossed quickly to a table. On it was an apparatus; the eyes of the\nolder man widened as he saw it. It was intricate--a maze of tubing.\nThere was a glass bulb above--the generator of a cathode ray,\nobviously--and electro-magnets below and on each side. Beneath was a\ncrude sphere of heavy lead--a retort, it might be--and from this there\npassed two massive, insulated cables. The understanding eyes of the\nProfessor followed them, one to a terminal on a great insulating block\nupon the floor, the other to a similarly protected terminal of carbon\nsome feet above it in the air.\n\nThe trembling fingers of the young man made some few adjustments, then\nhe left the instrument to take his place by an electric switch. \"Stand\nback,\" he warned, and closed the switch.\n\nThere was a gentle hissing from within glass tubes, the faint glow of a\nblue-green light. And that was all, until--with a crash like the ripping\ncrackle of lightning, a white flame arced between the terminals of the\nheavy cables. It hissed ceaselessly through the air where now the tang\nof ozone was apparent. The carbon blocks glowed with a brilliant\nincandescence when the flame ceased with the motion of a hand where\nAvery pulled a switch.\n\nThe man's voice was quiet now. \"You do not know, yet, what you have\nseen, but there was a tremendous potential there--an amperage I can't\nmeasure with my limited facilities.\" He waved a deprecating hand about\nthe ill-furnished laboratory. \"But you have seen--\" His voice trembled\nand failed at the forming of the words.\n\n\"--The disintegration of the atom,\" said Professor Eddinger quietly,\n\"and the release of power unlimited. Did you use thorium?\" he inquired.\n\nThe other looked at him in amazement. Then: \"I should have known you\nwould understand,\" he said humbly. \"And you know what it means\"--again\nhis voice rose--\"power without end to do the work of the world--great\nvessels driven a lifetime on a mere ounce of matter--a revolution in\ntransportation--in living....\" He paused. \"The liberation of mankind,\"\nhe added, and his voice was reverent. \"This will do the work of the\nworld: it will make a new heaven and a new earth! Oh, I have dreamed\ndreams,\" he exclaimed, \"I have seen visions. And it has been given to\nme--me!--to liberate man from the curse of Adam ... the sweat of his\nbrow.... I can't realize it even yet. I--I am not worthy....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe raised his eyes slowly in the silence to gaze in wondering\nastonishment at the older man. There was no answering light, no\nexaltation on the lined face. Only sadness in the tired eyes that looked\nat him and through him as if focused upon something in a dim future--or\npast.\n\n\"Don't you see?\" asked the wondering man. \"The freedom of men--the\nliberation of a race. No more poverty, no endless, grinding labor.\" His\nyoung eyes, too, were looking into the future, a future of blinding\nlight. \"Culture,\" he said, \"instead of heart-breaking toil, a chance to\ngrow mentally, spiritually; it is another world, a new life--\" And again\nhe asked: \"Surely, you see?\"\n\n\"I see,\" said the other; \"I see--plainly.\"\n\n\"The new world,\" said Avery. \"It--it dazzles me; it rings like music in\nmy ears.\"\n\n\"I see no new world,\" was the slow response.\n\nThe young face was plainly perplexed. \"Don't you believe?\" he stammered.\n\"After you have seen ... I thought you would have the vision, would help\nme emancipate the world, save it--\" His voice failed.\n\n\"Men have a way of crucifying their saviors,\" said the tired voice.\n\nThe inventor was suddenly indignant. \"You are blind,\" he said harshly;\n\"it is too big for you. And I would have had you stand beside me in the\ngreat work.... I shall announce it alone.... There will be\nlaboratories--enormous!--and factories. My invention will be perfected,\nsimplified, compressed. A generator will be made--thousands of\nhorsepower to do the work of a city, free thousands of men--made so\nsmall you can hold it in one hand.\"\n\nThe sensitive face was proudly alight, proud and a trifle arrogant. The\nexaltation of his coming power was strong upon him.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Professor Eddinger, \"in one hand.\" And he raised his right\narm that he might see where the end of a sleeve was empty.\n\n\"I am sorry,\" said the inventor abruptly; \"I didn't mean ... but you\nwill excuse me now; there is so much to be done--\" But the thin figure\nof Professor Eddinger had crossed to the far table to examine the\napparatus there.\n\n\"Crude,\" he said beneath his breath, \"crude--but efficient!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the silence a rat had appeared in the distant corner. The Professor\nnodded as he saw it. The animal stopped as the man's eyes came upon it;\nthen sat squirrellike on one of the shelves as it ate a crumb of food.\nSome morsel from a hurried lunch of Avery's, the Professor\nreflected--poor Avery! Yes, there was much to be done.\n\nHe spoke as much to himself as to the man who was now beside him. \"It\nenters here,\" he said and peered downward toward the lead bulb. He\nplaced a finger on the side of the metal. \"About here, I should\nthink.... Have you a drill? And a bit of quartz?\"\n\nThe inventor's eyes were puzzled, but the assurance of his old\ninstructor claimed obedience. He produced a small drill and a fragment\nlike broken glass. And he started visibly as the one hand worked\nawkwardly to make a small hole in the side of the lead. But he withdrew\nhis own restraining hand, and he watched in mystified silence while the\nquartz was fitted to make a tiny window and the thin figure stooped to\nsight as if aiming the opening toward a far corner where a brown rat sat\nupright in earnest munching of a dry crust.\n\nThe Professor drew Avery with him as he retreated noiselessly from the\ninstrument. \"Will you close the switch,\" he whispered.\n\nThe young man hesitated, bewildered, at this unexpected demonstration,\nand the Professor himself reached with his one hand for the black lever.\nAgain the arc crashed into life, to hold for a brief instant until\nProfessor Eddinger opened the switch.\n\n\"Well,\" demanded Avery, \"what's all the show? Do you think you are\nteaching me anything--about my own instrument?\" There was hurt pride and\njealous resentment in his voice.\n\n\"See,\" said Professor Eddinger quietly. And his one thin hand pointed to\na far shelf, where, in the shadow, was a huddle of brown fur and a bit\nof crust. It fell as they watched, and the \"plop\" of the soft body upon\nthe floor sounded loud in the silent room.\n\n\"The law of compensation,\" said Professor Eddinger. \"Two sides to the\nmedal! Darkness and light--good and evil--life ... and death!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe young man was stammering. \"What do you mean?--a death ray evolved?\"\nAnd: \"What of it?\" he demanded; \"what of it? What's that got to do with\nit?\"\n\n\"A death ray,\" the other agreed. \"You have dreamed, Avery--one must in\norder to create--but it is only a dream. You dreamed of life--a fuller\nlife--for the world, but you would have given them, as you have just\nseen, death.\"\n\nThe face of Avery was white as wax; his eyes glared savagely from dark\nhollows.\n\n\"A rat!\" he protested. \"You have killed a rat ... and you say--you\nsay--\" He raised one trembling hand to his lips to hold them from\nforming the unspeakable words.\n\n\"A rat,\" said the Professor--\"or a man ... or a million men.\"\n\n\"We will control it.\"\n\n\"All men will have it--the best and the worst ... and there is no\ndefence.\"\n\n\"It will free the world--\"\n\n\"It will destroy it.\"\n\n\"No!\"--and the white-faced man was shouting now--\"you don't\nunderstand--you can't see--\"\n\nThe lean figure of the scientist straightened to its full height. His\neyes met those of the younger man, silent now before him, but Avery knew\nthe eyes never saw him; they were looking far off, following the wings\nof thought. In the stillness the man's words came harsh and commanding--\n\n\"Do you see the cities,\" he said, \"crumbling to ruins under the cold\nstars? The fields? They are rank with wild growth, torn and gullied by\nthe waters; a desolate land where animals prowl. And the people--the\npeople!--wandering bands, lower, as the years drag on, than the beasts\nthemselves; the children dying, forgotten, in the forgotten lands; a\npeople to whom the progress of our civilization is one with the ages\npast, for whom there is again the slow, toiling road toward the light.\n\n\"And somewhere, perhaps, a conquering race, the most brutal and callous\nof mankind, rioting in their sense of power and dragging themselves down\nto oblivion....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis gaze came slowly back to the room and the figure of the man still\nfighting for his dream.\n\n\"They would not,\" said Avery hoarsely; \"they'd use it for good.\"\n\n\"Would they?\" asked Professor Eddinger. He spoke simply as one stating\nsimple facts. \"I love my fellow men,\" he said, \"and I killed them in\nthousands in the last war--I, and my science, and my poison gas.\"\n\nThe figure of Avery slumped suddenly upon a chair; his face was buried\nin his hands. \"And I would have been,\" he groaned, \"the greatest man in\nthe world.\"\n\n\"You shall be greater,\" said the Professor, \"though only we shall know\nit--you and I.... You will save the world--from itself.\"\n\nThe figure, bowed and sunken in the chair, made no move; the man was\nheedless of the kindly hand upon his shoulder. His voice, when he spoke,\nwas that of one afar off, speaking out of a great loneliness. \"You don't\nunderstand,\" he said dully; \"you can't--\"\n\nBut Professor Eddinger, a cog in the wheels of a great educational\nmachine, glanced at the watch on his wrist. Again his thin shoulders\nwere stooped, his voice tired. \"My classes,\" he said. \"I must be\ngoing....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the gathering dusk Professor Eddinger locked carefully the door of\nhis office. He crossed beyond his desk and fumbled with his one hand for\nhis keys.\n\nThere was a cabinet to be opened, and he stared long in the dim light at\nthe object he withdrew. He looked approvingly at the exquisite\nworkmanship of an instrument where a generator of the cathode ray and an\nintricate maze of tubing surmounted electro-magnets and a round lead\nbulb. There were terminals for attaching heavy cables; it was a\nbeautiful thing.... His useless arm moved to bring an imaginary hand\nbefore the window of quartz in the lead sphere.\n\n\"Power,\" he whispered and repeated Avery's words; \"power, to build a\ncity--or destroy a civilization ... and I hold it in one hand.\"\n\nHe replaced the apparatus in the safety of its case. \"The saviors of\nmankind!\" he said, and his tone was harsh and bitter.\n\nBut a smile, whimsical, kindly, crinkled his tired eyes as he turned to\nhis desk and its usual litter of examination papers.\n\n\"It is something, Avery,\" he whispered to that distant man, \"to belong\nin so distinguished a group.\"\n\n\n\n\nA STAR THAT BREATHES\n\n\nBeta Cephei, the mysterious Milky Way star which expands and contracts\nas though it were breathing, at last has a biography.\n\nA summary of known facts concerning the star, interpreted in the light\nof recent observations at the Lick Observatory at the University of\nCalifornia was completed recently by H. S. Mendenhall, graduate student.\n\nMendenhall's interpretations were said to lend weight to the theory that\nBeta Cephei is contracting and expanding once in every four and one-half\nhours. This is such a terrific rate of speed from a terrestrial point of\nview that it appears to be moving toward and away from the earth at a\nvelocity reaching a maximum of about nine and one-half miles per second.\n\nBeta Cephei is a variable star in the Constellation Cepheus. It is best\nvisible in the northern sky during July or August. Its distance from the\nearth is estimated roughly at 2,000,000,000,000,000 miles, and\nMendenhall estimates its diameter at almost 2,000,000 miles, more than\ntwice that of the sun.\n\nIn addition to the apparent velocity caused by contraction and expansion\nof its surface five times a day, Beta Cephei seems to have another\nmotion. This was said by Mendenhall to be a rotation around some other\nstar in a period of 20 years. Velocity of this rotation is something\nover three miles a second.\n\nVariable stars are of particular interest to astronomers because the\nlight from them pulsates regularly, flaring and dying as though fuel\nwere replenished at regular intervals. The rate of this pulsation has\nbeen found to be a measure to the candle power of the star. Its distance\nthen can be determined by contrasting its actual candle power with the\napparent magnitude as seen from the earth.\n\n[Illustration: _\"Oh my God!\" gasped Bell. He'd known this man before. A\nSecret Service man--one of the seven who had vanished._]\n\n\n\n\nMurder Madness\n\nPART THREE OF A FOUR-PART NOVEL\n\n_By Murray Leinster_\n\n\nSeven United States Secret Service men have disappeared in South\nAmerica. Another is found--a screaming homicidal maniac. It is rumored\nthat they are victims of a diabolical poison which produces \"murder\nmadness.\"\n\n[Sidenote: More and more South Americans are stricken with the horrible\n\"murder madness\" that lies in The Master's fearful poison. And Bell is\ntheir one last hope as he fights to stem the swiftly rising tide of a\ncontinent's utter enslavement.]\n\nCharley Bell of the \"Trade\"--a secret service organization which does\nnot officially exist--discovers that a sinister system of slavery is\nflourishing in South America, headed by a mysterious man known only as\nThe Master. This slavery is accomplished by means of a poison which\ncauses its victims to experience a horrible writhing of the hands,\nfollowed by a madness to do murder, two weeks after it is taken.\n\nThe victims get relief only with an antidote supplied through Ribiera,\nThe Master's Chief Deputy; but in the antidote there is more of the\npoison, which again in two weeks will take effect. And so it is that a\nperson who once receives the poison is forever enslaved.\n\nRibiera kidnaps Paula Canalejas, daughter of a Brazilian cabinet\nminister who, on becoming a victim, has killed himself, preferring\ndeath to \"murder madness.\" Bell rescues Paula, and they flee from\nRibiera in a plane. They find The Master's hidden jungle stronghold, and\nBell destroys it with a bomb attack from the air. As he is getting away\nhis motor quits. Paula jumps for her life, and shortly afterwards Bell\nfollows, drifting straight down towards his enemies below.\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nBell was falling head-first when the 'chute opened, and the jerk was\nterrific, the more so as he had counted not the customary ten, but\nfifteen before pulling out the ring. But very suddenly he seemed to be\nfloating down with an amazing gentleness, with the ruddy blossom of a\nparachute swaying against a background of lustrous stars very far indeed\nover his head. Below him were masses of smoke and at least one huge\ndancing mass of flame, where the storage tank for airplane gas had\nexploded. It was unlikely in the extreme, he saw now, that anyone under\nthat canopy of smoke could look up to see plane or parachute against the\nsky.\n\nClumsily enough, dangling as he was, Bell twisted about to look for\nPaula. Sheer panic came to him before he saw her a little above him but\na long distance off. She looked horribly alone with the glare of the\nfires upon her parachute, and smoke that trailed away into darkness\nbelow her. She was farther from the flames than Bell, too. The light\nupon her was dimmer. And Bell cursed that he had stayed in the plane to\nmake sure it would dive clear of her before he stepped off himself.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe glow on the blossom of silk above her faded out. The sky still\nglared behind, but a thick and acrid fog enveloped Bell as he descended.\nStill straining his eyes hopelessly, he crossed his feet and waited.\n\nBranches reached up and lashed at him. Vines scraped against his sides.\nHe was hurled against a tree trunk with stunning force, and rebounded,\nand swung clear, and then dangled halfway between earth and the jungle\nroof. It was minutes before his head cleared, and then he felt at once\ndespairing and a fool. Dangling in his parachute harness when Paula\nneeded him.\n\nThe light in the sky behind him penetrated even the jungle growth as a\nfaint luminosity. Presently he writhed to a position in which he could\nstrike a match. A thick, matted mass of climbing vines swung from the\nupper branches not a yard from his fingertips. Bell cursed again,\nfrantically, and clutched at it wildly. Presently his absurd kickings\nset him to swaying. He redoubled his efforts and increased the arc in\nwhich he swung. But it was a long time before his fingers closed upon\nleaves which came away in his grasp, and longer still before he caught\nhold of a wrist-thick liana which oozed sticky sap upon his hands.\n\nBut he clung desperately, and presently got his whole weight on it. He\nunsnapped the parachute and partly let himself down, partly slid, and\npartly tumbled to the solid earth below.\n\nHe had barely reached it when, muffled and many times reechoed among the\ntree trunks, he heard two shots. He cursed, and sprang toward the sound,\nplunging headlong into underbrush that strove to tear the flesh from his\nbones. He fought madly, savagely, fiercely.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe heard two more shots. He fought the jungle in the darkness like a\nmadman, ploughing insanely through masses of creepers that should have\nbeen parted by a machete, and which would have been much more easily\nslipped through by separating them, but which he strove to penetrate by\nsheer strength.\n\nAnd then he heard two shots again.\n\nBell stopped short and swore disgustedly.\n\n\"What a fool I am!\" he growled. \"She's telling me where she is, and\nI--\"\n\nHe drew one of the weapons that seemed to bulge in every pocket of his\nflying suit and fired two shots in the air in reply. A single one\nanswered him.\n\nFrom that time Bell moved more sanely. The jungle is not designed,\napparently, for men to travel in. It is assuredly not intended for them\nto travel in by night, and especially it is not planned, by whoever\nplanned it, for a man to penetrate without either machete or lights.\n\nAs nearly as he could estimate it afterward, it took Bell over an hour\nto cover one mile in the blackness under the jungle roof. Once he\nblundered into fire-ants. They were somnolent in the darkness, but one\nhand stung as if in white-hot metal as he went on. And thorns tore at\nhim. The heavy flying suit protected him somewhat, but after the first\nhundred yards he blundered on almost blindly, with his arms across his\nface, stopping now and then to try to orient himself. Three times he\nfired in the air, and three times an answering shot came instantly, to\nguide him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd then a voice called in the blackness, and he ploughed toward it, and\nit called again, and again, and at last he struck a match with trembling\nfingers and saw her, dangling as he had dangled, some fifteen feet from\nthe ground. She smiled waveringly, with a little gasp of relief, and he\nheard something go slithering away, very furtively.\n\nShe clung to him desperately when he had gotten her down to solid earth.\nBut he was savage.\n\n\"Those shots--though I'm glad you fired them--may have been a tip-off to\nthe town. We've got to keep moving, Paula.\"\n\nHer breath was coming quickly.\n\n\"They could trail us, Charles. By daylight we might not leave signs, but\nforcing our way through the night....\"\n\n\"Right, as usual,\" admitted Bell. \"How about shells? Did you use all\nyou had?\"\n\n\"Nearly. But I was afraid, Charles.\"\n\nBell felt in his pockets. Half a box. Perhaps twenty-five shells. With\nthe town nearby and almost certainly having heard their signals to each\nother. Black rage invaded Bell. They would be hunted for, of course.\nDogs, perhaps, would trail them. And the thing would end when they were\nat bay, ringed about by The Master's slaves, with twenty-five shells\nonly to expend.\n\nThe dim little glow in the sky between the jungle leaves kept up. It was\nbright, and slowly growing brighter. There was a sudden flickering and\neven the jungle grew light for an instant. A few seconds later there was\na heavy concussion.\n\n\"Something else went up then,\" growled Bell. \"It's some satisfaction,\nanyway, to know I did a lot of damage.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd then, quite abruptly, there was an obscure murmuring sound. It grew\nstronger, and stronger still. If Bell had been aloft, he would have seen\nthe planes from The Master's hangars being rushed out of their shelters.\nOne of the long row of buildings had caught. And the plateau of Cuyaba\nis very, very far from civilization. Tools, and even dynamos and\nengines, could be brought toilsomely to it, but the task would be\nterrific. Buildings would be made from materials on the spot, even the\nshelters for the planes. It would be much more practical to carry the\nparts for a saw mill and saw out the lumber on the spot than to attempt\nto freight roofing materials and the like to Cuyaba. So that the\nstructures Bell had seen in the wing lights' glow were of wood, and\ninflammable. The powerhouse that lighted the landing field was already\nablaze. The smaller shacks of the laborers perhaps would not be burnt\ndown, but the elaborate depot for communication by plane and wireless\nwas rapidly being destroyed. The reserve of gasoline had gone up in\nsmoke almost at the beginning, and in spreading out had extended the\ndisaster to nearly all the compact nerve-center of the whole conspiracy.\n\nPresently the droning noise was tumultuous. Every plane in a condition\nto fly was out on the landing field, now brightly lighted by the burning\nbuildings all about. There was frantic, hectic activity everywhere. The\nsecretaries of The Master were rescuing what records they could, and\ngrowing cold with terror. In the confusion of spreading flames and the\nnoise of roaring conflagrations the stopping of the motor up aloft had\npassed unnoticed. In the headquarters of The Master there was panic. An\nattack had been made upon The Master. A person who could not be one of\nhis slaves had found his stronghold and attacked it terribly. And if one\nman knew that location and dared attack it, then....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe hold of The Master upon all his slaves was based on one fact and its\ncorollary. The fact was, that those who had been given his poison would\ngo murder mad without its antidote. The corollary was that those who\nobeyed him would be given that antidote and be safe. True, the antidote\nwas but a temporary one, and mixed with it for administration was a\nfurther dosage of the poison itself. But the whole power of The Master\nwas based on his slaves' belief that as long as they obeyed him abjectly\nthere would be no failure of the antidote's supply. And Bell had given\nthat belief a sudden and horrible shock.\n\nOrders came from one frightened man, who cursed much more from terror\nthan from rage. Ribiera had advised him. To do him justice, Ribiera felt\nless fear than most. Nephew to The Master, and destined successor to The\nMaster's power, Ribiera dared not revolt, but at least he had little\nfear of punishment for incompetence. It was his advice that set the many\naircraft motors warming up. It was his direction that assorted out the\nbrainwork staff. And Ribiera himself curtly took control, indifferently\nabandoned the enslaved workers to the madness that would come upon them,\nand took wing in the last of a stream of roaring things that swept\nupward above the smoke and flame and vanished in the sky.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBell and Paula were huddled in between the buttress roots of a jungle\ngiant, protected on three sides by the monster uprearings of solid wood,\nand Bell was absorbedly feeding a tiny smudge fire. The smoke was thick\nand choking, but it did keep off the plague of insects which make jungle\ntravel much less than the romantic adventure it is pictured. Bell heard\nthe heavy, thunderous buzzing from the town change timbre suddenly. A\nsingle note of it grew loud and soared overhead.\n\nHe stared up instinctively, but saw nothing but leaves and branches and\nmany climbing things above him, dimly lighted by the smoky little blaze.\nThe roaring overhead went on, and dimmed. A second roaring came from the\ntown and rose to a monstrous growling and diminished. A third did\nlikewise, and a fourth.\n\nAt stated, even intervals the planes at headquarters of The Master took\noff from the landing field, ringed about with blazing buildings, and\nplunged through the darkness in a straight line. The steadier droning\nfrom the town grew lighter as the jungles echoed for many miles with the\nsounds of aircraft motors overhead.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt last a single plane rose upward and thundered over the jungle roof.\nIt went away, and away.... The town was silent, then, and only a faint\nand dwindling murmur came from the line of aircraft headed south.\n\n\"They've deserted the town, by God!\" said Bell, his eyes gleaming.\n\"Scared off!\"\n\n\"And--and we--\" said Paula, gazing at him.\n\n\"You can bet that every man who could crowd into a plane did so,\" said\nBell grimly. \"Those that couldn't, if they have any brains, will be\ntrying to make it some other way to where they can subject themselves to\none of The Master's deputies and have a little longer time of sanity.\nThe poor devils that are left--well--they'll be _camaradas_, _peons_,\nlaborers, without the intelligence to know what they can do. They'll\nwait patiently for their masters to come back. And presently their hands\nwill writhe.... And the town will be a hell.\"\n\n\"Then they won't be looking for us?\"\n\nBell considered. And suddenly he laughed.\n\n\"If the fire has burned out before dawn,\" he said coldly, \"I'll go\nlooking for them. It's going to be cold-blooded, and it's going to be\nrather pitiful, I think, but there's nothing else to do. You try to get\nsome rest. You'll need it.\"\n\nAnd for all the rest of the dark hours he crouched in the little angle\nformed by the roots of the forest giant, and kept a thickly smoking\nlittle fire going, and listened to the noises of the jungle all about\nhim.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was more than a mile back to the town. It was nearer two. But it was\nvastly less difficult to force a way through the thick growths by\ndaylight, even though then it was not easy. With machetes, of course,\nBell and Paula would have had no trouble, but theirs had been left in\nthe plane. Bell made a huge club and battered openings by sheer strength\nwhere it was necessary. Sweat streamed down his face before he had\ncovered five hundred yards, but then something occurred to him and he\nwent more easily. If there were any of the intelligent class of The\nMaster's subjects left in the little settlement, he wanted to allow time\nenough for them to start their flight. He wanted to find the place empty\nof all but laborers, who would be accustomed to obey any man who spoke\narrogantly and in the manner of a deputy of The Master. Yet he did not\nwant to wait too long. Panic spreads among the _camarada_ class as\nswiftly as among more intelligent folk, and it is even more blind and\nhysterical.\n\nIt was nearly eleven o'clock before they emerged upon a cleared field\nwhere brightly blooming plants grew hugely. Bell regarded these grimly.\n\n\"These,\" he observed, \"will be The Master's stock.\"\n\nPaula touched his arm.\n\n\"I have heard,\" she said, and shuddered, \"that the men who gather the\nplants that go to make the poisons of the _Indios_ do not--do not dare\nto sleep near the fresh-picked plants. They say that the odor is\ndangerous, even the perfume of the blossoms.\"\n\n\"Very probably,\" said Bell. \"I wish I could destroy the damned things.\nBut since we can't, why, we'll go around the edge of the field.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe went upwind, skirting the edge of the planted things. A path showed,\nwinding over half-heartedly cleared ground. He followed it, with Paula\nclose behind him. Smoke still curled heavily upward from the heaps of\nashes which he reached first of all. He looked upon them with an\nunpleasant satisfaction. He had to pick his way between still smoking\nheaps of embers to reach the huts about which laborers stood listlessly,\nnot working because not ordered to work, not yet frightened because not\nyet realizing fully the catastrophe that had come upon them.\n\nHe was moving toward them, deliberately adopting an air of suppressed\nrage, when a voice called whiningly.\n\n\"Senhor! Senhor!\" And then pleadingly, in Portuguese, \"I have news for\nThe Master! I have news for The Master!\"\n\nBell jerked his head about. Bars of thick wood, cemented into heavy\ntimbers at top and bottom. A building that was solid wall on three\nsides, and the fourth was bars. A white man in it, unshaven, haggard,\nragged, filthy. And on the floor of the cage....\n\nThere had been another such cage on a _fazenda_ back toward Rio. Bell\nhad looked into it, and had shot the gibbering Thing that had been its\noccupant, as an act of pure mercy. But this man had been through horrors\nand yet was sane.\n\n\"Don't look,\" said Bell sharply to Paula. He went close.\n\nThe figure pressed against the bars, whining. And suddenly it stopped\nits fawning.\n\n\"The devil!\" said the white man in the cage. \"What in hell are you doing\nhere, Bell? Has that fiend caught you too?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Oh, my God!\" gasped Bell. He went white with a cold rage. He'd known\nthis man before. A Secret Service man--one of the seven who had\nvanished. \"How's this place opened? I'll let you out.\"\n\n\"It may be dangerous,\" said the white man with a ghastly grin. \"I'm one\nof The Master's little victims. I've been trying to work a little game\nin hopes of getting within arm's reach of him. How'd you get here? Has\nhe got you too?\"\n\n\"I burned the damned town last night,\" snarled Bell, \"and crashed up\nafter it. Where's that door?\"\n\nHe found it, a solid mass of planks with a log bar fitted in such a way\nthat it could not possibly be opened from within. He dragged it wide.\nThe white man came out, holding to his self-control with an obvious\neffort.\n\n\"I want to dance and sing because I'm out of there,\" he told Bell\nqueerly, \"but I know you've done me no good. I've been fed The Master's\nlittle medicine. I've been in that cage for weeks.\"\n\nBell, quivering with rage, handed him a revolver.\n\n\"I'm going to get some supplies and stuff and try to make it to\ncivilization,\" he said shortly. \"If you want to help....\"\n\n\"Hell, yes,\" said the white man drearily. \"I might as well. Number\nOne-Fourteen was here.... He's The Master's little pet, now. Turned\ntraitor. Report it, if you ever get out.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Bell briefly. \"He didn't turn.\" He told in a very few words\nof the finding of the body of a man who had fallen or been thrown from a\nplane into the jungle.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were moving toward the rows of still standing shacks, then, and\nfaces were beginning to turn toward them, and there was a little stir of\napathetic puzzlement at sight of the white man who had been set free.\n\nThat white man looked suddenly at Paula, and then at Bell.\n\n\"I've been turned into a beast,\" he said wryly. \"Look here, Bell. There\nwere as many as ten and fifteen of us in that cage at one time--men the\ndeputies sent up for the purpose. We were allowed to go mad, one and two\nat a time, for the edification of the populace, to keep the _camaradas_\nscared. And those of us who weren't going mad just then used to have to\nband together and kill them. That cage has been the most awful hell on\nearth that any devil ever contrived. They put three women in there once,\nwith their hands already writhing.... Ugh!...\"\n\nBell's face was cold and hard is if carved from marble.\n\n\"I haven't lived through it,\" said the white man harshly, \"by being\nsoft. And I've got less than no time to live--sane, anyhow. I was\nthinking of shooting you in the back, because the young lady--\"\n\nHe laughed as Bell's revolver muzzle stirred.\n\n\"I'm telling you,\" said the white man in ghastly merriment, \"because I\nthought--I thought One-Fourteen had set me the example of ditching the\nService for his own life. But now it's different.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe pointed.\n\n\"There's a launch in that house, with one of these outboard motors. It\nwas used to keep up communication with the boat gangs that sweat the\nheavy supplies up the river. It'll float in three inches of water, and\nyou can pole it where the water's too shallow to let the propeller turn.\nThis rabble will mob you if you try to take it, because it'll have taken\nthem just about this long to realize that they're deserted. They'll\nthink you are a deputy, at least, to have dared release me. I'm going to\nconvince them of it, and use this gun to give you a start. I give you\ntwo hours. It ought to be enough. And then....\"\n\nBell nodded.\n\n\"I'm not Service,\" he said curtly, \"but I'll see it's known.\"\n\nThe white man laughed again.\n\n\"'Some sigh for the glories of this world, and some for a prophet's\nparadise to come,'\" he quoted derisively. \"I thought I was hard, Bell,\nbut I find I prefer to have my record clean in the Service--where nobody\nwill ever see it--than to take what pleasure I might snatch before I\ndie. Queer, isn't it? Old Omar was wrong. Now watch me bluff, flinging\naway the cash for credit of doubtful value, and all for the rumble of a\ndistant drum--which will be muted!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were surrounded by swarming, fawning, frightened _camaradas_ who\nimplored the Senhor to tell them if he were a deputy of The Master, and\nif he were here to make sure nothing evil befell them. They worked for\nThe Master, and they desired nothing save to labor all their lives for\nThe Master, only--only--The Master would allow no evil to befall them?\n\nThe white man waved his arms grandiloquently.\n\n\"The Senhor you behold,\" he proclaimed in the barbarous Portugese of the\nhinterland of Brazil, \"has released me from the cage in which you saw\nme. He is the deputy of The Master himself, and is enraged because the\nlanding lights on the field were not burning, so that his airplane fell\ndown into the jungle. He bears news of great value from me to The\nMaster, which will make me finally a sub-deputy of The Master. And I\nhave a revolver, as you see, with which I could kill him, but he dares\nnot permit me to die, since I have given him news for The Master. I\nshall wait here and he will go and send back an airplane with the grace\nof The Master for me and for all of you.\"\n\nBell snarled an assent, in the arrogant fashion of the deputies of The\nMaster. He waited furiously while the Service man argued eloquently and\nfluently. He fingered his revolver suggestively when a wave of panic\nswept over the swarming mob for no especial reason. And then he watched\ngrimly while the light little metal-bottomed boat was carried to the\nwater's edge and loaded with food, and fuel, and arms, and ammunition,\nand even mosquito bars.\n\nThe white man grinned queerly at Bell as he extended his hand in a last\nhandshake.\n\n\"'I, who am about to die, salute you!'\" he said mockingly. \"Isn't this a\nhell of a world, Bell? I'm sure we could design a better one in some\nways.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBell felt a horrible, a ghastly shock. The hand that gripped his was\nwrithing in his grasp.\n\n\"Quite so,\" said the white man. \"It started about five minutes ago. In\ntheory, I've about forty-eight hours. Actually, I don't dare wait that\nlong, if I'm to die like a white man. And a lingering vanity insists on\nthat. I hope you get out, Bell.... And if you want to do me a\nfavor,\"--he grinned again, mirthlessly--\"you might see that The Master\nand as many of his deputies as you can manage join me in hell at the\nearliest possible moment. I shan't mind so much if I can watch them.\"\n\nHe put his hands quickly in his pockets as the little outboard motor\ncaught and the launch went on down-river. He did not even look after\nthem. The last Bell saw of him he was swaggering back up the little\nhillside above the river edge, surrounded by scared inhabitants of the\nworkmen's shacks, and scoffing in a superior fashion at their fears.\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nIt took Bell just eight days to reach the Paraguay, and those eight days\nwere like an age-long nightmare of toil and discomfort and more than a\nlittle danger. The launch was headed downstream, of course, and with the\ncurrent behind it, it made good time. But the distances of Brazil are\ninfinite, and the jungles of Brazil are malevolent, and the route down\nthe Rio Lauren\u00e7o was designed by the architect of hell. _Raudales_ lay\nin wait to destroy the little boat. Insects swarmed about to destroy its\nvoyagers. And the jungle loomed above them, passively malignant, and\nwaited for them to die.\n\nAnd as if physical sufferings were not enough, Bell saw Paula wilt and\ngrow pale. All the way down the river they passed little clearings at\nnearly equal distances. And men came trembling out of the little houses\nupon those _fazendas_ and fawned upon the Senhor who was in the launch\nthat had come from up-river and so must be in the service of The Master\nhimself. The clearings and the tiny houses had been placed upon the\nriver for the service of the terribly laboring boat gangs who brought\nthe heavier supplies up the river to The Master's central depot. Men at\nthese clearings had been enslaved and ordered to remain at their posts,\nserving all those upon the business of The Master. They fawned abjectly\nupon Bell, because he was of _os gentes_ and so presumably was\nempowered, as The Master had empowered his more intelligent subjects, to\nexact the most degraded of submission from all beneath him in the\nhorrible conspiracy. Once, indeed, Bell was humbly implored by a panic\nstricken man to administer \"the grace of The Master\" to a moody and\nirritable child of twelve or so.\n\n\"She sees the red spots, Senhor. It is the first sign. And I have served\nThe Master faithfully....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd Bell could do nothing. He went on savagely. And once he passed a\ngang of _camaradas_ laboring to get heavily loaded dugouts up a fiendish\n_raudal_. They had ropes out and were hauling at them from the bank,\nwhile some of their number were breast-deep in the rushing water,\npushing the dugouts against the stream.\n\n\"They're headed for the plantation,\" said Bell grimly, \"and they'll need\nthe grace of The Master by the time they get there. And it's abandoned.\nBut if I tell them....\"\n\nMen with no hope at all are not to be trusted. Not when they are\nmixtures of three or more races--white and black and red--and steeped in\nignorance and superstition and, moreover, long subject to such masters\nas these men had had. Bell had to think of Paula.\n\nHe could have landed and haughtily ordered them to float or even carry\nthe light boat to the calmer waters below. They would have obeyed and\ncringed before him. But he shot the rapids from above, with the little\nmotor roaring past rocks and walls of jungle beside the foaming water,\nat a speed that chilled his blood.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPaula said nothing. She was white and listless. Bell, himself, was being\npreyed upon by a bitter blend of horror and a deep-seated rage that\nconsumed him like a fever. He had fever itself, of course. He was\ntaking, and forcing Paula to take, five grains of quinine a day. It had\nbeen included among his stores as a matter of course by those who had\nloaded his boat. And with the fever working in his brain he found\nhimself holding long, imaginary conversations, in which one part of his\nbrain reproached the other part for having destroyed the plantation of\nThe Master. The laborers upon that plantation had been abandoned to the\nmurder madness because of his deed. The caretakers of the tiny _fazenda_\non the river bank were now ignored. Bell felt himself a murderer because\nhe had caused The Master's deputies to cast them off in a callous\nindifference to their inevitable fate.\n\nHe suffered the tortures of the damned, and grew morose and bitter, and\ncould only escape that self torture by coddling his hatred of Ribiera\nand The Master. He imagined torments to be inflicted upon them which\nwould adequately repay them for their crimes, and racked his feverish\nbrain for memories of the appalling atrocities which can be committed\nupon the human body without destroying its capacity to suffer.\n\nIt was not normal. It was not sane. But it filled Bell's mind and\nsomehow kept him from suicide during the horrible passage of the river.\nHe hardly dared speak to Paula. There was a time when he counted the\ndays since he had been a guest at Ribiera's estate outside of Rio, and\nfrenziedly persuaded himself that he saw red spots before his eyes and\nsoon would have the murder madness come upon him. And then he thought of\nthe supplies in Ribiera's plane, in which they had escaped from Rio.\nThey had eaten that food.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was almost unconsciously, then, that he saw the narrow water on which\nthe launch floated valiantly grow wider day by day. When at last it\ndebouched suddenly into a vast stream whereon a clumsy steamer plied\nbeneath a self made cloud of smoke, he stared dully at it for minutes\nbefore he realized.\n\n\"Paula,\" he said suddenly, and listened in amazement to his voice. It\nwas hoarse and harsh and croaking. \"Paula, we've made it. This must be\nthe Paraguay.\"\n\nShe roused herself and looked about like a person waking from a\nlethargic sleep. And then her lips quivered, and she tried to speak and\ncould not, and tears fell silently from her eyes, and all at once she\nwas sobbing bitterly.\n\nThat sign of the terrific strain she had been under served more than\nanything else to jolt Bell out of his abnormal state of mind. He moved\nover to her and clumsily put his arm about her, and comforted her as\nbest he could. And she sat sobbing with her head on his shoulder,\ngasping in a form of hysterical relief, until the engine behind them\nsputtered, and coughed, and died.\n\nWhen Bell looked, the last drop of gasoline was gone. But the motor had\nserved its purpose. It had run manfully on an almost infinitesimal\nconsumption of gasoline for eight days. It had not missed an explosion\nsave when its wiring was wetted by spray. And now....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBell hauled the engine inboard and got out the oars from under the\nseats. He got the little boat out to mid-stream, and they floated down\nuntil a village of squalid huts appeared on the eastern bank. He landed,\nthere, and with much bargaining and a haughty demeanor disposed of the\nboat to the skipper of a _batelao_ in exchange for passage down-river as\nfar as Corumba. The rate was outrageously high. But he had little\ncurrency with him and dared go no farther on a vessel which carried a\nboat of The Master's ownership conspicuously towed behind.\n\nAt Corumba he purchased clothes less obviously of _os gentes_, both for\nhimself and for Paula, and that same afternoon was able to arrange for\ntheir passage to Asunci\u00f3n as deck passengers on a river steamer going\ndownstream.\n\nIt was as two peasants, then, that they rode in sweltering heat amid a\nswarming and odorous mass of fellow humanity downstream. But it was a\ncurious relief, in some ways. The people about them were gross and\nunwashed and stupid, but they were human. There was none of that\ndiabolical feeling of terror all about. There were no strained, fear\nhaunted faces upon the deck reserved for deck passengers and other\ncattle. The talk was ungrammatical and literal and of the earth. The\nwomen were stolid-faced and reserved. But when the long rows of hammocks\nwere slung out in the open air, in the casual fashion of sleeping\narrangements in the back-country of all South America, it was blessedly\npeaceful to realize that the folk who snored so lustily were merely\nhuman; human animals, it might be, with no thought above their _farinha_\nand _feijos_ on the morrow, but human.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd the second day they passed the old fort at Coimbra, and went on. The\npassage into Paraguayan territory was signalized by an elaborate customs\ninspection, and three days later Asunci\u00f3n itself displayed its red-tiled\nroofs and adobe walls upon the shore.\n\nBell had felt some confidence in his ability to pass muster with his\nSpanish, though his Portuguese was limited, and it was a shock when the\ncaptain of the steamer summoned him to his cabin with a gesture, before\nthe steamer docked. Bell left Paula among the other deck passengers and\nwent with the peasant's air of suspicious humility into the captain's\nquarters. But the captain's pose of grandeur vanished at once when the\ndoor closed.\n\n\"Se\u00f1or,\" said the steamer captain humbly, \"I have not spoken to you\nbefore. I knew you would not wish it. But tell me, senor! Have you any\nnews of what The Master plans?\"\n\nBell's eyes flickered, at the same time that a cold apprehension filled\nhim.\n\n\"Why do you speak to me of The Master?\" he demanded sharply.\n\nThe steamer captain stammered. The man was plainly frightened at Bell's\ntone. Bell relaxed, his flash of panic for Paula gone.\n\n\"I know,\" said the captain imploringly, \"that the great _fazenda_ has\nbeen deserted. On my last trip, down, senor, I brought many of the high\ndeputies who had been there. They warned me not to speak, senor, but I\nsaw that you were not what you seemed, and I thought you might be going\nabout to see who obeyed The Master's orders....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBell nodded.\n\n\"That is my mission,\" he said curtly. \"Do not speak of it further--not\neven to the deputy in Asunci\u00f3n.\"\n\nThe captain stammered again.\n\n\"But I must see the Se\u00f1or Francia,\" he said humbly. \"I report to him\nafter every trip, and if he thought that I did not report all that I\nlearn....\"\n\n\"It is my order,\" snapped Bell angrily. \"If he reproaches you, say that\none who has orders from The Master himself gave them to you. And do not\nspeak of the destruction of the _fazenda_. I am searching especially for\nthe man who caused it. And--wait! I will take your name, and you shall\ngive me--say--a thousand pesos. I had need of money to bribe a fool I\ncould not waste time on, up-country. It will be returned to you.\"\n\nAnd again the captain stammered, but Bell stared at him haughtily, and\nhe knelt abjectly before the ship's safe.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAsunci\u00f3n, as everybody knows, is a city of sixty thousand people, and\nthe capital of a republic which enjoyed the rule of a family of\nhereditary dictators for sixty years; which rule ended in a war wherein\nfour-fifths of the population was wiped out. And since that beginning it\nhas averaged eight revolutions to Mexico's three, has had the joy of\nknowing seven separate presidents in five years--none of them\nelected--and now boasts a population approximately two-thirds\nillegitimate and full of pride in its intellectual and artistic tastes.\n\nBell and Paula made their way along the cobbled streets away from the\nriver, surrounded by other similarly peasant-seeming folk. Bell told her\ncurtly what had happened with the steamer captain.\n\n\"It's the devil,\" he said coldly, \"because this whole republic is under\nThe Master's thumb. Except among the peasants we can count on nearly\neverybody being on the lookout for us, if they so much as suspect we're\nalive. And they may because I burned their damned _fazenda_. So....\"\n\nPaula smiled at him, rather wanly.\n\n\"What are you going to do, Charles?\"\n\n\"Get a boat,\" said Bell curtly. \"One with three or four men, if I can.\nIf I can buy it with the skipper's money, I will. But I can't take you\nto go bargaining. It would look suspicious.\"\n\nThey had reached the central plaza of the town. The market swarmed with\nbrown skinned folk and seemed to overflow with fruits. A man was\nunconcernedly shoveling oranges out of a cart with a shovel, as if they\nhad been so much coal. A market woman as unconcernedly dropped some of\nthe same golden fruit within a small pen where a piglet awaited a\npurchaser. To the left, there were rows of unshaded stalls where the\ninfinitely delicate handmade Paraguayan lace was exposed for sale.\n\n\"I--think,\" said Paula, \"I think I will go in the cathedral. I will be\nvery devout, Charles, and you will find me there when you return. I will\nbe safe there, certainly.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe walked with her across the crowded plaza. He should have known that\nyour peasant does not stride with head up, but regarding the ground.\nThat a man who works heavily droops his shoulders with weariness at the\nend of a day. And especially he should have realized that Paraguay is\nnot, strictly speaking, a Latin-American nation. It is Latin-Indian, in\nwhich the population graduates very definitely from a sub-stratum of\nnearly or quite pure Indian race to an aristocracy of nearly or quite\npure Spanish descent, and that the color of a man's skin fixes his place\nin society. Both Bell and Paula were too light of skin for the peasant's\nclothes they wore. They aroused curiosity at once. If it was not an\nactive curiosity, it was nevertheless curiosity of a sort.\n\nBut Bell left her in the shadowy, cool interior of the cathedral which\nseems so pitifully small to be the center of religion for a nation. He\nsaw her move toward one of the little candle-lit niches in the wall and\nfall quite simply on her knees there.\n\nAnd he moved off, to wander aimlessly down to the river shore and stare\nabout and presently begin a desultory conversation with sleepy boatmen.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was three hours and more before he returned to the Cathedral, and\nPaula was talking to someone. More, talking to a woman in the most\ndiscreet of mantilla'd church-going costumes. Paula saw him in the\ndoorway, and uttered a little cry of relief. She came hurrying to him.\n\n\"Charles! I have found a friend! Isabella Ybarra. We were schoolmates in\nthe United States and she has just come back from Paris! So you see, she\ncannot--\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Bell very quietly.\n\nPaula was speaking swiftly and very softly.\n\n\"We went to school together, Charles. I trust her. You must trust her\nalso. There is no danger, this time. Isabella has never even heard of\nThe Master. So you see....\"\n\n\"I see that you need someone you can trust,\" said Bell grimly. \"_I_\nfound that the captain of the steamer had gone to The Master's deputy\nhere. While I was talking to some boatmen a warning was given to look\nout for a man and woman, together, who may try to buy a boat. We're\ndescribed, and only the fact that I was alone kept me from being\nsuspected. Police, soldiers--everybody is looking out for us. Paraguay's\nunder The Master's thumb more completely than any other nation on the\ncontinent.\"\n\nThe figure to which Paula had been talking was moving slowly toward\nthem. A smiling, brown-eyed face twinkled at them.\n\n\"You must be Charles!\" said a warm and cluckling voice. \"Paula has\nraved, Se\u00f1or. Now I am going to take her off in my carriage. She is my\nmaid. And you will follow the carriage on foot and I will have the\nmajor-domo let you in the servants' entrance, and the three of us will\nconspire.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was incongruous to hear the English of a girl's finishing school from\nthe mantilla'd young woman who beamed mischievously at him. She had the\ndelighted air of one aiding a romance. It was doubly incongruous because\nof the dark and shadowy Cathedral in which they were, and the raucous\nnoises of the market in the plaza without. Bell had a sense of utter\nunreality as Isabella's good humored voice went on:\n\n\"Do you remember, Paula, the time the French teacher caught us in the\npantry? I shall feel just like that time.\"\n\n\"This is dangerous,\" said Bell, steadily, \"and it is very serious\nindeed.\"\n\n\"Pooh!\" said Isabella comfortably. \"Paula, you didn't even know I was\nmarried! A whole year and a half! And he's a darling, really. I'm the\nSe\u00f1ora Isabella Ybarra de Zuloaga, if you please! Bow gracefully!\" She\nchuckled. \"Jaime came all the way to Rio to meet me last month. I'm wild\nabout him, Paula.... But come on! Follow me humbly, like a nice little\n_mestizo_ girl who wants to be my maid, and I'll let you ride with the\n_cochero_ and Charles shall follow behind us.\"\n\nShe swept out of the Cathedral with the air of a grande dame suppressing\na giggle, and Paula went humbly behind her.\n\nAnd Bell trudged through the dust and the blistering sun while the\nhighly polished carriage jolted over cobble stones and the youthful\nSe\u00f1ora Isabella Ybarra de Zuloaga beamed blissfully at the universe\nwhich did not realize that she was a conspirator, and Paula sat modestly\nbeside the brown skinned _cochero_.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was not a long ride nor a long walk, though the sun was insufferable.\nThe capital of Paraguay is not large. It is a sleepy, somnolent little\ntown in which the most pretentious building was begun as the\nPresidential Palace and wound up as the home of a bank. But there are\nbullet marks on the fa\u00e7ade of the _Museo Nacion\u00e1l_, and there is still\nan empty pedestal here and there throughout the city where the heroes of\nlast year's revolution, in bronze, have been pulled down and the heroes\nof this year's uprising of the people have not yet been set up. Red\ntiled roofs give the city color, and the varying shades of its populace\ngive it variety, and the fact that below the whiter class of inhabitants\n_Guarani_ is spoken instead of Spanish adds to the individuality of its\neffect.\n\nBut the house into which the carriage turned could have been built in\nRio or Buenos Aires without comment on its architecture. It had the\nouter bleakness of most private homes of South America, but if it was\nhuge and its windows were barred, the patio into which Bell was ushered\nby a bewildered and suspicious major-domo made up in color and in charm\nfor all that the exterior lacked.\n\nA fountain played amid flowers, and macaws and parrots and myriad other\ncaged birds hung in their cages about the colonnade around the court,\nand Bell found Paula being introduced to a pale young man in the stiff\ncollar and unspeakably formal morning clothes of the South American who\nis of the upper class.\n\n\"Jaime,\" said Isabella, beaming. \"And this is Charles, whom Paula is to\nmarry! It is romantic! It is fascinating! And I depend on you to give\nhim clothes so that all our servants won't stare goggle-eyed at him, and\nI am going to take Paula off at once and dress her! They are our guests!\nAnd, Jaime, you must threaten all the servants terribly so they will\nkeep it very secret--that we have two such terrible people with us.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPaula smiled at Bell, and he saw that she felt utterly safe and wholly\nat peace. Something was hammering at Bell's brain, warning him, and he\ncould not understand what it was. But he exchanged the decorous limp\nhandshake which is conventional south of Panama, and followed his\nunsmiling host to rooms where a servant laid out a bewildering\nassortment of garments. They were all rather formal, the sort of\nclothing that is held to be fitting for a man of position where Spanish\nis the official if not the common tongue.\n\nHis host retired, without words, and Bell came out later to find him\nsipping moodily at a drink, waiting for him. He wiped his forehead.\n\n\"Be seated, Se\u00f1or,\" he said heavily, \"until the ladies join us.\"\n\nHe wiped his forehead again and watched somberly while Bell poured out a\ndrink.\n\n\"Isabella....\" He seemed to find it difficult to speak. \"She has told me\na little, but there has been no time for more than a little: I do not\nwish to have her tell me too much. She does not understand. She was\neducated in North America, where customs are different. She demands that\nI assist you and the senorita--it is the senorita?\"\n\nBell stiffened. In all Spanish America the conventions are strict. For a\nman and woman to travel together, even perforce and for a short\ndistance, automatically damns the woman.\n\n\"Go on,\" said Bell grimly.\n\nHis host was very pale indeed.\n\n\"She demands that I assist you and the senorita to escape the police and\nthe government. Provided that you do not tell me who you are, I will\nattempt it. But--\"\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Bell quietly, \"if you have ever seen red spots dancing\nbefore your eyes.\"\n\nHis host went utterly livid.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nZuloaga looked down at his hands, as if expecting unguessable things of\nthem. And then he shrugged, and said harshly:\n\n\"I have, Se\u00f1or. So you see that Isabella, who does not know, is asking\nme to risk, not only my life, but her honor.\"\n\nBell said nothing for a moment. He was a little pale.\n\n\"And your honor?\" he asked quietly.\n\nThe pallor on the face of the Se\u00f1or Jaime Zuloaga was horrible. He tried\nto speak, and could not. He stood up, and managed to say:\n\n\"So much I will risk, because you have been my guest. Until to-morrow\nmorning you are safe, unless the Se\u00f1or Francia has his spies within my\nown house. I--I will attempt, even to procure a boat. But--\"\n\nSomething made Bell turn. The major-domo was moving quickly out of\nsight. Like a flash Bell was upon him, and like a flash a knife came\nout.\n\nBell's host gasped. The fact that his servant had spied was more than\nobvious, and he had spoke treason against The Master. He leaned against\nthe table, sick and trembling and mumbling of despair, while there were\ncrashes in the room into which Bell had plunged, while bodies thrashed\nabout on the floor, and while stertorous breathing grew less, and\nstopped....\n\nBell came back, breathing hard. The front of his coat was slashed open.\n\n\"He's dead,\" he said harshly. \"He'd have reported what you said, so I\nkilled him.... And now we've got to do something with his body.\"\n\nHe helped in the horrible task, while his host grew more and more\nshaken. No other servants came near. And Bell could almost read the\nthoughts that went through Zuloaga's brain. One servant had spied, to\nreport his treason. And that meant assassination for himself, as the\nleast of punishments, and for his wife....\n\nBut there would be no punishment if he went first to the deputy and said\nthat Bell had killed the major-domo.\n\nBell left the house before dusk, desperately determined to steal a craft\nof some sort, return for Paula, and get away from Asunci\u00f3n before dawn.\n\nHe returned after an hour. In the morning a man would be found bound and\ngagged, with five hundred pesos stuffed into his pockets. His boat would\nhave vanished.\n\nBut there was a commotion before the house where Paula waited fearfully.\nA carriage stood there, with a company of mounted soldiers about it.\nSomeone was being put into it. As Bell broke into a run toward the house\nthe carriage started up and the soldiers trotted after it.\n\nPaula was taken.\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nThat night Bell turned burglar. To attempt a rescue of Paula was simply\nout of the question. He was entirely aware that he would be expected to\ndo just such a thing, and that it would be adequately guarded against.\nTherefore he prepared for a much more desperate enterprise by\nburglarizing a bookstore in the particularly neat method in which\nmembers of The Trade are instructed. The method was invented by a member\nof The Trade who was an ex-cabinet maker, and who perished disreputably.\nHe killed a certain courier of a certain foreign government, thereby\npreventing a minor war and irritating two governments excessively, and\nwas hanged.\n\nThe method, of course, is simplicity itself. One removes the small nails\nwhich hold the molding of a door panel in place. The molding comes out.\nSo does the panel. One enters through the panel, commits one's burglary,\nand comes out, replacing the molding and the nails with reasonable care.\nDepending upon the care with which the replacing is done, the means of\nentrance is more or less undiscoverable. But it is usually used when it\nis not intended that the burglary ever be discussed.\n\nBell abstracted two books, wrapping paper and twine. He departed, using\ngreat care. He walked three miles out of town and to the banks of the\nParaguay. There he carefully saturated the pages of both books in\nwater, carefully keeping the bindings from being wetted. Then he tore\none book to pieces, saving the leaves and inserting them between the\nleaves of the other book. Then, with a brazil nut candle for\nillumination, he began to write.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nYou see, when two thoroughly wetted pieces of paper are placed one above\nthe other with a hard surface such as the cover of another book under\nthem, you can write upon the top one with a stick. The writing will show\ndark against the gray of the saturated paper. You then remove the top\nsheet and end the writing reproduced on the bottom sheet. And then you\ncan dry the second sheet and find the marking vanished--until it is\nwetted again. It is, in fact, a method of water-marking paper. And it is\nthe simplest of all methods of invisible writing.\n\nBell wrote grimly for hours. The book he had chosen was an old one, an\nancient copy of one of Lope de Vega's plays, and the pages were wrinkled\nand yellow from age alone. When, by dawn, the last page was dried out,\nthere was no sign that anything other than antiquity had affected the\npaper. And Bell wrapped it carefully, and addressed it to an elderly\nsenora of literary tastes in San Juan, Porto Rico, and enclosed an\naffectionate letter to his very dear aunt, and signed it with an\nentirely improbable name.\n\nIt was mailed before sunrise, the necessary stamps having been filched\nfrom the burglarized bookstore and the price thereof being carefully\ninserted in the till. Bell had made a complete and painstaking report of\nevery fact he had himself come upon in the matter of The Master and his\nslaves and appended to it a copy of the report of the dead Secret\nService operative Number One-Fourteen. He destroyed that after copying\nit. And he concluded that since he had been given dismissal by Jamison\nin Rio, he considered himself at liberty to take whatever steps he saw\nfit. And since the Senhorina Paula Canalejas had been kidnapped by\nagents of The Master, he intended to take steps which might possibly\nbring about her safety, but would almost certainly cause his death.\n\nThe report should at least be of assistance if the Trade set to work to\ncombat The Master. Bell had no information whatever about that still\nmysterious and still more horrible person himself. But what he knew\nabout The Master's agents he sent to a lady in Porto Rico who has an\nastonishingly large number of far ranging nephews. And then Bell got\nhimself adequately shaved, bought a hearty breakfast, and, after one or\ntwo heartening drinks, was driven grandly to the residence of the Se\u00f1or\nFrancia, deputy of The Master for the republic of Paraguay.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe servants who admitted him gazed blankly when he gave his name. A\ndoor was hastily closed behind him. He was ushered into an elaborate\nreception room and, after an agitated pause, no less than six separate\nfrock-coated persons appeared and pointed large revolvers at him while a\nseventh searched him exhaustively. Bell submitted amusedly.\n\n\"And now,\" he said dryly, \"I suppose the Se\u00f1or Francia will receive me?\"\n\nThere was more agitation. The six men remained; with their weapons\npointed at him. The seventh departed, and Bell re-dressed himself in a\nleisurely fashion.\n\nTen minutes later a slender, dark skinned man with impeccably waxed\nmoustaches entered, regarded Bell with an entirely impersonal interest,\ntook one of the revolvers from one of the six frock-coated gentlemen,\nand seated himself comfortably. He waved his hand and they filed\nuneasily from the room. So far, not one word had been spoken.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBell retrieved his cigarette case and lighted up with every appearance\nof ease.\n\n\"I have come,\" he said casually, \"to request that I be sent to The\nMaster. I believe that he is anxious to meet me.\"\n\nThe dark eyes scrutinized him coldly. Then Francia smiled.\n\n\"_Pero si_,\" he said negligently, \"he is very anxious to see you. I\nsuppose you know what fate awaits you?\"\n\nHis smile was amiable and apparently quite friendly, but Bell shrugged.\n\n\"I suppose,\" he said dryly, \"he wants to converse with me. I have been\nhis most successful opponent to date, I think.\"\n\nFrancia smiled again. It was curious how his smile, which at first\nseemed so genuine and so friendly, became unspeakably unpleasant on its\nrepetition.\n\n\"Yes.\" Francia seemed to debate some matter of no great importance. \"You\nhave been very annoying, Se\u00f1or Bell. The Senhor Ribiera asked that you\nbe sent to him. It was his intention to execute you, privately. He\ndescribed a rather amusing method to me. And I must confess that you\nhave annoyed me, likewise. Since the Cuyaba plantation was destroyed my\nsubjects have been much upset. They have been frightened, and even\nstubborn. Only last week\"--he smiled pleasantly, and the effect was\nhorrible--\"only last week I desired the society of a lady who is my\nsubject. And her husband considered that, since the _fazenda_ was\ndestroyed, The Master would be powerless to extend his grace before\nlong, in any event. So he shot his wife and himself. It annoyed me\nenough to make me feel that it would be a pleasure to kill you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe raised the revolver meditatively.\n\n\"Well?\" said Bell coldly.\n\nFrancia lowered the weapon and laughed.\n\n\"Oh, I shall not do it. I think The Master would be displeased. You seem\nto have the type of courage he most desires in his deputies. And it may\nyet be that I shall greet you as my fellow deputy or perhaps my fellow\nviceroy. So I shall send you to him. I would say that you have about an\neven chance of dying very unpleasantly or of being a deputy. Therefore I\noffer you such courtesies as I may.\"\n\nBell puffed a cloud of smoke toward the ceiling.\n\n\"I'm about out of cigarettes,\" he said mildly.\n\n\"They shall be supplied. And--er--if you would desire feminine society,\nI will have some of my pretty subjects....\"\n\n\"No,\" said Bell bluntly. \"I would like to speak to the Senhorina\nCanalejas, though.\"\n\nFrancia chuckled.\n\n\"She left for Buenos Aires last night. The Senhor Ribiera sent a most\nimpatient message for her to be sent on at once. I regretted it, but he\nhad The Master's authority. I thought her charming, myself.\"\n\nThe skin about Bell's knuckles was white. His hands had clenched\nsavagely.\n\n\"In that event,\" he said coldly, \"the only other courtesy I would ask is\nthat of following her as soon as possible.\"\n\nFrancia rose languidly. The revolver dangled by his side, but his grip\nupon it was firm. He smiled at Bell with the same effect of a horrible,\nghastly geniality.\n\n\"Within the hour, Se\u00f1or,\" he said urbanely. \"With the guard I shall\nplace over you it is no harm, I am sure, to observe that The Master is\nat his retreat in Punta Arenas. You will go there to-morrow, as I go\nto-night.\"\n\nHe moved toward the door, and smiled again, and added pleasantly:\n\n\"The Senhorina was delivered to the Senhor Ribiera this morning.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMatters moved swiftly after that. A servant brought cigarettes and a\ntray of liquors--which Bell did not touch. There was the sound of\nmovement, the scurrying, furtive haste which seems always to imply a\ndesperate sort of fear. Bell waited in a terrible calmness, while rage\nhammered at his temples.\n\nThen the clattering of horses' hoofs outside. A carriage was being\nbrought. Soldiers came in and a man beckoned curtly. Bell stuffed his\npockets with smokes and followed languidly. He was realizing that there\nwas little pretense of secrecy about the power of The Master's deputy\nhere. Police and soldiers.... But Paraguay, of all the nations of the\nsouthern continent, has learned a certain calm realism about\ngovernmental matters.\n\nThe man who has power is obeyed. The man who has not power is not\nobeyed. Titles are of little importance, though it is the custom for the\nman with the actual power eventually to assume the official rank of\nauthority. Since the President in Asunci\u00f3n was no more than a figurehead\nwho called anxiously upon the Se\u00f1or Francia every morning for\ninstructions concerning the management of the nation, Francia\nindifferently ignored him whenever he chose and gave orders directly.\nThere would be very little surprise and no disorder whatever when The\nMaster proclaimed Paraguay a viceroyalty of his intended empire.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe carriage went smartly through the cobbled streets with a cavalry\nescort all about it. An officer sat opposite Bell with his hand on his\nrevolver.\n\n\"I am receiving at least the honors of royalty,\" Bell commented coldly\nto him, in Spanish.\n\n\"Se\u00f1or,\" said the officer harshly, \"this is the state in which the\ndeputies of The Master were escorted.\"\n\nHe watched Bell heavily, but with the desperate intentness of a man who\nknows no excuses will be received if his prisoner escapes.\n\nOut of the town to a flying field, where a multi-engined plane was\nwarming up. It was one of the ships that had been at The Master's\n_fazenda_ of Cuyaba, one of the ships that had fled from the burning\nplantation. Bell was ushered into it with a ceremonious suspicion.\nAlmost immediately he was handcuffed to his seat. Two men took their\nplace behind him. The big ship rolled forward, lifted, steadied, and\nafter a single circling set out to the southeast for Buenos Aires.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe whole performance had been run off with the smoothly oiled\nprecision of an iron discipline exercised upon men in the grip of deadly\nfear.\n\n\"One man, at least,\" reflected Bell grimly, \"has some qualities that fit\nhim for his job.\"\n\nAnd then, for hour after hour, the big ship went steadily southeast. It\nflew over Paraguayan territory for two hours, soaring high over the Lago\nYpoa and on over the swampy country that extends to the Argentine\nborder. It ignored that border and all customs formalities. It went on,\nthrough long hours of flight, while mountains rose before it. It rose\nover those mountains and passed over the first railroad line--the first\nreal sign of civilization since leaving Asunci\u00f3n--at Mercedes, and\nreached the Uruguay river where the Mirinjay joins it. It went roaring\non down above the valley of the Rio Uruguay for long and tedious hours\nmore. At about noon, lunch was produced. The two men who guarded Bell\nate. Then, with drawn revolvers, they unlocked his handcuffs and offered\nhim food.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe ate, of exactly those foods he had seen them eat. He submitted\nindifferently to the re-application of his fetters. He had reached a\nstate which was curiously emotionless. If Paula had been turned over to\nRibiera that morning, Paula was dead. And just as there is a state of\ngrief which stuns the mind past the realization of its loss, so there is\na condition of hatred which leads to an enormous calmness and an\nunnatural absence of any tremor. Bell had reached that state. The\ninstinct of self-preservation had gone lax. Where a man normally thinks\nfirst, if unconsciously, of the protection of his body from injury or\npain, Bell had come to think first, and with the same terrible clarity,\nof the accomplishment of revenge.\n\nHe would accept The Master's terms, if The Master offered them. He would\nbecome The Master's subject, accepting the poison of madness without a\nqualm. He would act and speak and think as a subject of The Master,\nuntil his opportunity came. And then....\n\nHis absolute calmness would have deceived most men. It may have deceived\nhis guards. Time passed. The Rio de la Plata spread out widely below the\nroaring multi-engined plane and the vast expanse of buildings which is\nBuenos Aires appeared far ahead in the gathering dusk. Little twinkling\nlights blinked into being upon the water and the earth far away. Then\none of the two guards touched Bell on the shoulder.\n\n\"Se\u00f1or,\" he said sharply above the motors' muffled roar, \"we shall land.\nA car will draw up beside the plane. There will be no customs\ninspection. That has been arranged for. You can have no hope of escape.\nI ask you if you will go quietly into the car?\"\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Bell evenly. \"I went to Se\u00f1or Francia of my own\naccord.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe guard leaned back. The city of Buenos Aires spread out below them.\nThe tumbled, congested old business quarter glittered in all its\noffices, and the broad Avenida de Mayo cut its way as a straight slash\nof glittering light through the section of the city to eastward. By\ncontrast, from above, the far-flung suburbs seemed dark and somber.\n\nThe big plane roared above the city, settling slowly; banked steeply and\ncircled upon its farther side, and dipped down toward what seemed an\nabsurdly small area, which sprang into a pinkish glow on their descent.\nThat area spread out as the descent continued, though, and was a wide\nand level field when the ship flattened out and checked and lumbered to\na stop.\n\nA glistening black car came swiftly, humming into place alongside almost\nbefore the clumsy aircraft ceased to roll. Its door opened. Two men got\nout and waited. The hangars were quite two hundred yards away, and Bell\nsaw the glitter of weapons held inconspicuously but quite ready.\n\nHe stepped out of the cabin of the plane with a revolver muzzle pressing\ninto his spine. Other revolver muzzles pressed sharply into his sides as\nhe reached earth.\n\nSmiling faintly, he took four steps, clambered up into the glistening\nblack car, and settled down comfortably into the seat. The two men who\nhad waited by the car followed him. The door closed, and Bell was in a\npadded silence that was acutely uncomfortable for a moment. A dome light\nglowed brightly, however, and he lighted nearly the last of the\ncigarettes from Asunci\u00f3n with every appearance of composure as the car\nstarted off with a lurch.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe windows were blank. Thick, upholstered padding covered the spaces\nwhere openings should have been, and there was only the muffled\nvibration of the motor and the occasional curiously distinct noise of a\nflexing spring.\n\n\"Just as a matter of curiosity,\" said Bell mildly, \"what is the excuse\ngiven on the flying field for this performance? Or is the entire staff\nsubject to The Master?\"\n\nTwo revolvers were bearing steadily upon him and the two men watched him\nwith the unwavering attention of men whose lives depend upon their\nvigilance.\n\n\"You, Se\u00f1or,\" said one of them without expression or a smile, \"are the\ncorpse of a prominent politician who died yesterday at his country\nhome.\"\n\nAnd then for half an hour or more the car drove swiftly, and stopped,\nand drove swiftly forward again as if in traffic. Then there were many\nturns, and then a slow and cautious traverse of a relatively few feet.\nIt stopped, and then the engine vibration ceased.\n\n\"I advise you, Se\u00f1or,\" said the same man who had spoken before, and in\nthe same emotionless voice, \"not to have hope of escape in the moment of\nalighting. We are in an enclosed court and there are two gates locked\nbehind us.\"\n\nBell shrugged as there was the clatter of a lock operating. The door\nswung wide.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe stepped down into a courtyard surrounded by nearly bare walls. It had\nonce been the _patio_ of a private home of some charm. Now, however, it\nwas bleak and empty. A few discouraged flowers grew weedily in one\ncorner. The glow of light in the sky overhead assured Bell that he was\nin the very heart of Buenos Aires, but only the most subdued of rumbles\nspoke of the activity and the traffic of the city going on without.\n\n\"This way,\" said the man with the expressionless voice.\n\nThe other man followed. The chauffeur of the car stood aside as if some\nformality required him neither to start the motor or return to his seat\nuntil Bell was clear of the courtyard.\n\nThrough a heavy timber door. Along a passageway with the odor of\nneglect. Up stairs which once had been impressive and ornamental. Into a\nroom without windows.\n\n\"You will have an interview with the Se\u00f1orita Canalejas in five\nminutes,\" said the emotionless voice.\n\nThe door closed, while Bell found every separate muscle in his body draw\ntaut. And while his brain at first was dazed with incredulous relief,\nthen it went dark with a new and ghastly terror.\n\n\"They know _yagu\u00e9_,\" he heard himself saying coldly, \"which makes any\nperson obey any command. They may know other and more hellish ones yet.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe fought for self control, which meant the ability to conceal\nabsolutely any form of shock that might await him. That one was in store\nhe was certain. He paced grimly the length of the room and back\nagain....\n\nSomething on the carpet caught his eye. A bit of string. He stared at it\nincredulously. The end was tied into a curious and an individual knot,\nwhich looked like it might be the pastime of a sailor, and which looked\nlike it ought to be fairly easy to tie. But it was one of those knots\nwhich wandering men sometimes tie absent mindedly in the presence of\nstirring events. It was the recognition-knot of the Trade, one of those\nsigns by which men may know each other in strange and peculiar\nsituations. And there were many other knots tied along the trailing\nlength of the string. It seemed as if some nervous and distraught\nprisoner in this room might have toyed abstractedly with a bit of cord.\n\nOnly, Bell drew it through his fingers. Double knot, single knot, double\nknot.... They spelled out letters in the entirely simple Morse code of\nthe telegrapher, if one noticed.\n\n\"RBRA GN ON PLA HRE ST TGT J.\"\n\nYour old-time telegrapher uses many abbreviations. Your short-wave fan\nuses more. Mostly they are made by a simple omission of vowels in normal\nEnglish words. And when the recognition sign at the beginning was\nconsidered, the apparently cryptic letters leaped into meaning.\n\n\"RiBeRA GoNe ON PauLA HeRe SiT TiGhT Jamison.\"\n\nWhen the door opened again and a terribly pale Paula was ushered in,\nBell gave no sign of surprise. He simply took her in his arms and kissed\nher, holding her very, very close.\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nPaula remained in the room with Bell for perhaps twenty minutes, and\nBell had the feeling of eyes upon them and of ears listening to their\nevery word. In their first embrace, in fact, he murmured a warning in\nher ear and she gasped a little whispered word of comprehension. But it\nwas at least a relief to be sure that she was alive and yet unharmed.\nFrancia had been in error when he told Bell of Paula's delivery to the\nBrazilian to be enslaved or killed as Ribiera found most amusing. Or\nperhaps, of course, Francia had merely wanted to cause Bell all possible\ndiscomfort.\n\nIt was clear, however, blessedly clear and evident, that Paula's pallor\nwas due to nothing more than terror--a terror which was now redoubled\nbecause Bell was in The Master's toils with her. Forgetting his warning,\nshe whispered to him desperately that he must try to escape, somehow,\nbefore The Master's poison was administered to him. Outside, he might do\nsomething to release her. Here, a prisoner, he was helpless.\n\nBell soothed her, not daring either to confess the plan he had formed of\na feigned submission in order to wreak revenge, or to offer\nencouragement because of the message knotted in the piece of string by\nJamison. And because of that caution she came to look at him with a\nqueer doubt, and presently with a terrible quiet grief.\n\n\"Charles--you--you have been poisoned like the rest?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe feeling of watching eyes and listening ears was strong. Bell had a\npart to play, and the necessity for playing that part was the greater\nbecause now he was forced to hope. He hesitated, torn between the need\nto play his r\u00f4le for the invisible eavesdroppers and the desire to spare\nPaula.\n\nHer hand closed convulsively upon his.\n\n\"V-very well, Charles,\" she said quietly, though her lips quivered.\n\"If--if you are going to serve The Master, I--I will serve him too, if\nhe will let me stay always near you. But if he--will not, then I can\nalways--die....\"\n\nBell groaned. And the door opened silently, and there were men standing\nwithout. An emotionless voice said:\n\n\"Se\u00f1orita, the Se\u00f1or Ortiz will interview the Se\u00f1or Bell.\"\n\n\"I'm coming,\" said Paula quietly.\n\nShe went, walking steadily. Two men detached themselves from the group\nabout the door and followed her. The others waited for Bell. And Bell\nclenched his hands and squared his shoulders and marched grimly with\nthem.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAgain long passages, descending to what must have been a good deal below\nthe surface of the earth. And then a massive door was opened, and light\nshone through, and Bell found himself standing on a rug of the thickest\npossible pile in a room of quite barbaric luxury, and facing a desk from\nwhich a young man was rising to greet him. This young man was no older\nthan Bell himself, and he greeted Bell in a manner in which mockery was\nentirely absent, but in which defiance was peculiarly strong. A bulky,\nround shouldered figure wrote laboriously at a smaller desk to one side.\n\n\"Se\u00f1or Bell,\" said the young man bitterly, \"I do not ask you to shake\nhands with me. I am Julio Ortiz, the son of the man you befriended upon\nthe steamer _Almirante Gomez_. I am also, by the command of The Master,\nyour jailer. Will you be seated?\"\n\nBell's eyes flickered. The older Ortiz had died by his own hand in the\nfirst stages of the murder madness The Master's poison produced. He had\ndied gladly and, in Bell's view, very gallantly. And yet his son.... But\nof course The Master's deputies made a point of enslaving whole families\nwhen it was at all possible. It gave a stronger hold upon each member.\n\n\"I beg of you,\" said young Ortiz bitterly, \"to accept my invitation. I\nwish to offer you a much qualified friendship, which I expect you to\nrefuse.\"\n\nBell sat down and crossed his knees. He lit a cigarette thoughtfully,\nthinking swiftly.\n\n\"I remember, and admired, your father,\" he said slowly. \"I think that\nany man who died as bravely as he did is to be envied.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe younger Ortiz had reseated himself as Bell sat down, and now he\nfingered nervously, wretchedly, the objects on his desk. A penholder\nbroke between his fingers and he flung it irritably into the\nwastebasket.\n\n\"You understand,\" he said harshly, \"the obligations upon me. I am the\nsubject of The Master. You will realize that if you desire to escape, I\ncannot permit it. But you did my father a very great kindness. Much of\nit I was able to discover from persons on the boat. More, from the\nwireless operator who is also the subject of The Master. You were not\nacting, Se\u00f1or, as a secret service operative in your attempt to help my\nfather. You bore yourself as a very honorable gentleman. I wish to thank\nyou.\"\n\n\"I imagine,\" said Bell dryly, \"that anyone would have done what I did.\"\n\nHe seemed to be quite at ease, but he was very tense indeed. The bulky,\nround shouldered figure at the other desk was writing busily with a very\nscratchy pen. It was an abominable pen. Its sputtering was loud enough\nto be noticeable under any circumstances, but Bell was unusually alert,\njust now, and suddenly he added still more drily:\n\n\"Helping a man in trouble is quite natural. One always gets it back.\nIt's a sort of dealing with the future in which there is a profit on\nevery trade.\"\n\nHe put the slightest emphasis on the last word and waited, looking at\nyoung Ortiz, but listening with all his soul to the scratching of the\npen. And that scratching sound ceased abruptly. The pen seemed to write\nsmoothly all of an instant. Bell drew a deep breath of satisfaction. In\nthe Trade, when in doubt, one should use the word \"Trade\" in one's first\nremark to the other man. Then the other man will ask your trade, and you\nreply impossibly. It is then up to the other man to speak frankly,\nfirst. But circumstances alter even recognition-signs.\n\nOrtiz had not noticed any by-play, of course. It would have been rather\nextraordinary if he had. A pen that scratches so that the sound is\nMorse code for \"Bell, play up. J.\" is just unlikely enough to avoid all\nnotice.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOrtiz drummed upon the desk. \"Now, Se\u00f1or, what can I do that will serve\nyou? I cannot release you. You know that. I am not the deputy here.\nThere has been a set-back to The Master's plans and all the deputies are\ncalled to his retreat to receive instructions and to discuss. I have\nmerely been ordered to carry out the deputy's routine labors until he\nreturns. However, I will be obeyed in any matter. I can, and will, do\nanything that will make you more comfortable or will amuse you, from a\nchange in your accommodations to providing you with companions. You\nobserve,\" he added with exquisite bitterness, \"that the limit of my\ncapacity to prove my friendship is to offer my services as a pander.\"\n\nBell gazed at the tip of his cigarette, letting his eyes wander about\nthe room for an instant, and permitting them to rest for the fraction of\na second upon the round shouldered, writing form by the side wall.\n\n\"I am sufficiently amused,\" he said mildly. \"I asked to be sent to The\nMaster. He intends to make me an offer, I understand. Or he did. He may\nhave changed his mind. But I am curious. Your father told me a certain\nthing that seemed to indicate he did not enjoy the service of The\nMaster. Your tone is quite loyal, but unhappy. Why do you serve him?\nAside, of course, from the fact of having been poisoned by his deputy.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nInternally, Bell was damning Jamison feverishly. If he was to play up to\nOrtiz, why didn't Jamison give him some sign of how he was to do it?\nSome tip....\n\n\"Herr Wiedkind,\" said Ortiz wearily, \"perhaps you can explain.\"\n\nThe round shouldered figure swung about and bowed profoundly to Bell.\n\n\"Der Se\u00f1or Ortiz,\" he said gutturally, and in a sepulchral profundity,\n\"he does not understand himself. I haff nefer said it before. But he\nserfs Der Master because he despairs, andt he will cease to serf Der\nMaster when he hopes. And I--I serf Der Master because I hope, andt I\nwill cease to serf him when I despair.\"\n\nOrtiz looked curiously and almost suspiciously at the Germanic figure\nwhich regarded him soberly through thick spectacles.\n\n\"It is not customary, Herr Wiedkind,\" he said slowly, \"to speak of\nceasing to serve The Master.\"\n\n\"Idt is not customary to speak of many necessary things,\" said the round\nshouldered figure dryly. \"Of our religions, for example. Of der women we\nlofe. Of our gonsciences. Of various necessary biological functions. But\nin der presence of der young man who is der enemy of Der Master we can\nspeak freely, you and I who serf him. We know that maybe der deputies\nserf because they enjoy it. But der subjects? Dey serf because dey fear.\nAndt fear is intolerable. A man who is afraid is in an unstable\ngondition. Sooner or later he is going to stop fearing because he gets\nused to it--when Der Master will haff no more hold on him--or else he is\ngoing to stop fearing because he will kill himself.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo an outsider the spectacle of the three men in their talk would have\nbeen very odd indeed. Two men who served The Master, and one who had\nbeen his only annoying opponent, talking of the service of The Master\nquite amicably and without marked disagreement.\n\nOrtiz stirred and drummed nervously on the desk. The round shouldered\nfigure put the tips of its fingers together.\n\n\"How did you know,\" demanded Ortiz suddenly, \"that I serve because I\ndespair?\"\n\nBell watched keenly. He began to see where the talk was trending, and\nwaited alertly for the moment for him to speak. This was a battlefield,\nthis too luxurious room in which young Ortiz seemed an alien. Rhetoric\nwas the weapon which now would serve the best.\n\n\"Let us talk frankly,\" said the placid German voice. \"You andt I, Se\u00f1or\nOrtiz, haff worked together. You are not a defil like most of the\ndeputies, and I do not regret hafing been sent here to help you. And I\nam not a scoundtrel like most of those who help the deputies, so you\nhaff liked me a little. Let us talk frankly. I was trapped. I am a\ncapable segretary. I speak seferal languages. I haff no particular\nambitions or any loyalties. I am useful. So I was trapped. But you,\nSe\u00f1or Ortiz, you are different.\"\n\nOrtiz suddenly smiled bitterly.\n\n\"It is a saying in Brazil, if I recall the words, '_A cauda do demonio e\nde rendas._' 'The devil's tail is made of lace.' That is the story.\"\n\nBell said quietly:\n\n\"No.\"\n\nOrtiz stared at him. He was very pale. And suddenly he laughed without\nany amusement whatever.\n\n\"True,\" said Ortiz. He smiled in the same bitterness. \"I had forgotten.\nI am a slave, and the Herr Wiedkind is a slave, and you, Se\u00f1or Bell, are\nthe enemy of our master. But I had forgotten that we are gentlemen. In\nthe service of The Master one does forget that there are gentlemen.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe laughed again and lighted a cigarette with hands that shook a little.\n\n\"I loved a girl,\" he said in a cynical amusement. \"It is peculiar that\none should love any woman, _se\u00f1ores_--or do you, Se\u00f1or Bell, find it\nnatural? I loved this girl. It pleased my father. She was of a family\nfully equal to my own: their wealth, their position, their traditions\nwere quite equal, and it was a most suitable match. Most remarkable of\nall, I loved her as one commonly loves only when no such considerations\nexist. It is amusing to me now, to think how deeply, and how truly, and\nhow terribly I loved her....\"\n\nYoung Ortiz's pallor deepened as he smiled at them. His eyes, so dark as\nto be almost black, looked at them from a smiling mask of whiteness.\n\n\"There was no flaw anywhere. A romance of the most romantic, my father\nvery happy, her family most satisfied and pleased, and I--I walked upon\nair. And then my father suddenly departed for the United States, quite\nwithout warning. He left a memorandum for me, saying that it was a\nmatter of government, a secret matter. He would explain upon his return.\nI did not worry. I haunted the house of my fianc\u00e9e. The habits of her\nfamily are of the most liberal. I saw her daily, almost hourly, and my\ninfatuation grew. And suddenly I grew irritable and saw red spots before\nmy eyes....\n\n\"Her father took me to task about my nervousness. He led me kindly to a\nman of high position, who poured out for me a little potion.... And\nwithin an hour all my terrible unease had vanished. And then they told\nme of The Master, of the poison I had been given in the house of my\nfianc\u00e9e herself. They informed me that if I served The Master I would be\nprovided with the antidote which would keep me sane. I raged.... And\nthen the father of my fianc\u00e9e told me that he and all his family served\nThe Master. That the girl I loved, herself, owed him allegiance. And\nwhile I would possibly have defied them and death itself, the thought of\nthat girl not daring to wed me because of the poison in her veins.... I\nsaw, then, that she was in terror. I imagined the two of us comforting\neach other beneath the shadow of the most horrible of fates....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOrtiz was silent for what seemed to be a long time, smiling mirthlessly\nat nothing. When his lips parted, it was to laugh, a horribly discordant\nlaughter.\n\n\"I agreed,\" he said in ghastly amusement. \"For the sake of my loved\none, I agreed to serve The Master that I might comfort her. And plans\nfor our wedding, which had been often and inexplicably delayed, were set\nin train at once. And the deputy of The Master entertained me often. I\nplied him with drink, striving to learn all that I could, hoping against\nhope that there would be some way of befooling him and securing the\nantidote without the poison.... And at last, when very drunken, he\nlaughed at me for my intention of marriage. He advised me tipsily to\nserve The Master zealously and receive promotion in his service. Then,\nhe told me amusedly, I would not care for marriage. My fianc\u00e9e would be\nat my disposal without such formalities. In fact--while I stood rigid\nwith horror--he sent a command for her to attend him immediately. He\ncommanded me to go to an apartment in his dwelling. And soon--within\nminutes, it seemed--the girl I loved came there to me....\"\n\nBell did not move. This was no moment to interrupt. Ortiz's fixed and\ncynical smile wavered and vanished. His voice was harsh.\n\n\"She was at my disposal, as an act of drunken friendship by the deputy\nof The Master. She confessed to me, weeping, that she had been at the\ndisposal of the deputy himself. Of any other person he cared to divert\nor amuse.... Oh! _Dios!_\"\n\nOrtiz stopped short and said, in forced calmness:\n\n\"That also was the night that my father died.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSilence fell. Bell sat very still. The Teutonic figure spoke quietly\nafter the clock had ticked for what seemed an interminable period.\n\n\"You didt know, then, that your father's death was arranged?\"\n\nOrtiz turned stiffly to look at him.\n\n\"Here,\" said the placid voice, quaintly sympathetic. \"Look at these.\"\n\nA hand extended a thick envelope. Ortiz took it, staring with wide,\ndistended eyes. The round shouldered figure stood up and seemed to\nshake itself. The stoop of its shoulders straightened out. One of the\nseemingly pudgy hands reached up and removed the thick spectacles. A\nbushy gray eyebrow peeled off. A straggly beard was removed. The other\neyebrow.... Jamison nodded briefly to Bell, and turned to watch Ortiz.\n\nAnd Ortiz was reading the contents of the envelope. His hands began to\nshake violently. He rested them on the desk-top so that he could\ncontinue to read. When he looked up his eyes were flaming.\n\n\"The real Herr Wiedkind,\" said Jamison dryly, \"came up from Punta Arenas\nwith special instructions from The Master. You have talents, Se\u00f1or\nOrtiz, which The Master wished to use. Also you have considerable wealth\nand the prestige of an honorable family. But you were afflicted with\nideas of honor and decency, which are disadvantageous in deputies of The\nMaster. The real Herr Wiedkind had remarkable gifts in eradicating those\nideas.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJamison sat down and crossed his knees carefully.\n\n\"I looked you up because I knew The Master had killed your father,\" he\nadded mildly, \"and I thought you'd either be hunting The Master or he'd\nbe hunting you. My name's Jamison. I killed the real Wiedkind and took\nhis identification papers. He was a singularly unpleasant beast. His\nidea of pleasure made him seem a fatherly sort of person, very much like\nmy make-up. He was constantly petting children, and appeared very\nbenign. I am very, very glad that I killed him.\"\n\nOrtiz tore at his collar, suddenly. He seemed to be choking.\n\n\"This--this says.... It is The Master's handwriting! I know it! And it\nsays--\"\n\n\"It says,\" Jamison observed calmly, \"that since your father killed the\nprevious deputy in an attempt to save you from The Master's poison, that\nyou are to be prepared for the work your father had been assigned. Herr\nWiedkind is given special orders about your--ah--moral education. In\npassing, I might say that your father was sent to the United States\nbecause it was known he'd killed the previous deputy. He told Bell he'd\ndone that killing. And he was allowed to grow horribly nervous on his\nreturn. He was permitted to see the red spots, because he was\nofficially--even as far as you were concerned--to commit suicide.\n\n\"It was intended that his nervousness was to be noticed. And a plane\ntried to deliver a message to him. Your father thought the parcel\ncontained the antidote to the poison that was driving him mad. Actually,\nit was very conventional prussic acid. Your father would have drunk it\nand dropped dead, a suicide, after a conspicuous period of nervousness\nand worry.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBell felt his cigarette burning his fingers. He had sat rigid until the\nthing burned short. He crushed out the coal, looking at Ortiz.\n\nAnd Ortiz seemed to gasp for breath. But with an almost superhuman\neffort he calmed himself outwardly.\n\n\"I--think,\" he said with some difficulty, \"that I should thank you. I\ndo. But I do not think that you told me all of this without some motive.\nI abandon the service of The Master. But what is it that you wish me to\ndo? You know, of course, that I can order both of you killed....\"\n\nBell put down the stub of his cigarette very carefully.\n\n\"The only thing you can do,\" he said quietly, \"is to die.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Ortiz with a ghastly smile. \"But I would like my death to\nperform some service. The Master has no enemies save you two, and those\nof us who die on becoming his enemies. I would like, in dying, to do him\nsome harm.\"\n\n\"I will promise,\" said Jamison grimly, \"to see that The Master dies\nhimself if you will have Bell and myself put in a plane with fuel to\nPunta Arenas and a reasonable supply of weapons. I include the Se\u00f1orita\nCanalejas as a matter of course.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOrtiz looked from one to the other. And suddenly he smiled once more. It\nwas queer, that smile. It was not quite mirthless.\n\n\"You were right, just now,\" he observed calmly, \"when as the Herr\nWiedkind you said that I would quit the service of The Master when I\nceased to despair. I begin to have hopes. You two men have done the\nimpossible. You have fought The Master, you have learned many of his\nsecrets, and you have corrupted a man to treason when treason means\nsuicide. Perhaps, Se\u00f1ores, you will continue to achieve the impossible,\nand assassinate The Master.\"\n\nHe stood up, and though deathly pale continued to smile.\n\n\"I suggest, Se\u00f1or, that you resume your complexion. And you, Se\u00f1or Bell,\nyou will be returned to your confinement. I will make the necessarily\nelaborate arrangements for my death.\"\n\nBell rose. He liked this young man. He said quietly:\n\n\"You said just now you wouldn't ask me to shake hands. May I ask\nyou?...\" He added almost apologetically as Ortiz's fingers closed upon\nhis: \"You see, when your father died I thought that I would be very glad\nif I felt that I would die as well. But I think\"--he smiled wryly--\"I\nthink I'll have two examples to think of when my time comes.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the morning a bulky, round shouldered figure entered the room in\nwhich Bell was confined.\n\n\"You will follow me,\" said a harsh voice.\n\nBell shrugged. He was marched down long passageways and many steps. He\ncame out into the courtyard, where the glistening black car with the\nblank windows waited. At an imperious gesture, he got in and sat down\nwith every appearance of composure, as of a man resignedly submitting\nto force he cannot resist. The thick spectacles of the Herr Wiedkind\nregarded him with a gogglelike effect. There was a long pause. Then the\nsound of footsteps. Paula appeared, deathly pale. She was ushered into\nthe vehicle--and only Bell's swift gesture of a finger to his lips\nchecked her cry of relief.\n\nVoices outside. The guttural Spanish of the Herr Wiedkind. Other,\nemotionless voices replying. The Herr Wiedkind climbed heavily into the\ncar and sat down, producing a huge revolver which bore steadily upon\nBell. The door closed, and he made a swift gesture of caution.\n\n\"Idt may be,\" said the Germanic voice harshly, \"that you and the young\nladty haff much to say to each other. But idt can wait. And I warn you,\n_mein Herr_, that at the first movement I shall fire.\"\n\nBell relaxed. There was the purring of the motor. The car moved off.\nObviously there was some microphonic attachment inside the tonneau which\ncarried every word within the locked vehicle to the ears of the two men\nupon the chauffeur's seat. An excellent idea for protection against\ntreachery. Bell smiled, and moved so that his lips were a bare half-inch\nfrom Paula's ears.\n\n\"Try to weep, loudly,\" he said in the faintest of whispers. \"This man is\na friend.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut Paula could only stare at the bulky figure sitting opposite until he\nsuddenly removed the spectacles, and smiled dryly, and then reached in\nhis pockets and handed Bell two automatic pistols, and extended a tiny\nbut very wicked weapon to Paula. He motioned to her to conceal it.\n\nJamison--moving to make the minimum of noise--handed Bell a sheet of\nstiff cardboard. It passed into Bell's fingers without a rustle. He\nshowed it silently to Paula.\n\n     We were overheard last night by someone. We don't know who or how\n     much he heard. Dictaphone in the room we talked in. Can't find out\n     who it was or what action he's taken. We may be riding into a trap\n     now. Ortiz has disappeared. He may be dead. We can only wait and\n     see.\n\nThe car was moving as if in city traffic, a swift dash forward and a\nsudden stop, and then another swift dash. But the walls within were\npadded so that no sound came from without save the faint vibration of\nthe motor and now and then the distinct flexing of a spring. Then the\ncar turned a corner. It went more rapidly. It turned another corner. And\nanother....\n\nIn the light of the bright dome light, Bell saw beads of sweat coming\nout on Jamison's face. He did not dare to speak, but he formed words\nwith his lips.\n\n\"He's turning wrong! This isn't the way to the field!\"\n\nBell's jaws clenched. He took out his two automatics and looked at them\ncarefully. And then, much too short a time from the departure for the\nflying field to have been reached, the car checked. It went over rough\ncobblestones, and Bell himself knew well that there had been no cobbled\nroadway between the flying field and his prison. And then the car went\nup a sort of ramp, a fairly steep incline which by the feel of the motor\nwas taken in low, and on for a short distance more. Then the car stopped\nand the motor was cut off.\n\nKeys rattled in the lock outside. The door opened. The blunt barrel of\nan automatic pistol peered in.\n\n(_To be concluded in the next issue._)\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n[Illustration: _The Readers' Corner_\n\n_A Meeting Place for Readers of_ Astounding Stories]\n\n\n_About Reprints_\n\nFrom time to time the Editors of Astounding Stories receive letters,\nlike the two that follow, in which Readers beg us to run reprints, and\nnow we feel it is time to call attention to the very good reasons why we\nmust refuse.\n\nWe admit, right off, that some splendid Science Fiction stories have\nbeen published in the past--but are those now being printed in any way\ninferior to them? Aren't even _better_ ones being written to-day?--since\na whole civilization now stirs with active interest in science?--since\nthree or five times as many writers are now supplying us with stories to\nchoose from?--since science and scientific theory have reached so\nimmeasurably much farther into the Realm of the Unknown Possible?\n\nThe answer is an emphatic _Yes_. We all know it.\n\n\"A Trip to the Moon\"--for instance--was a good story, but shall we keep\nreprinting it to-day, when recent revolutionary theories of space-time\nscream to modern authors for Science-Fiction treatment? In the last ten\nyears the whole aspect, the whole future of science has broadened; we\nhave sensed an infinity beyond infinity; and who would be so un-modern\nas to cling to the oft-told stories of the older science and neglect the\nthrilling reaches of the new!\n\n_The Saturday Evening Post_--again, for instance--has been publishing\ngood stories for years, but who would have them reprint the old ones\ninstead of keep giving us good new ones?\n\nWould it be fair to 99% of our Readers to force on them reprint novels\nthey have already read, or had a chance to read, to favor the 1% who\nhave missed them? Of course it wouldn't, and all of our Readers in that\n1% will gladly admit it.\n\nAnd how about our authors? Contrary to the old-fashioned opinion,\nauthors must eat--and how will they eat, and lead respectable lives, and\nkeep out of jail, if we keep reprinting their _old_ stories and turning\ndown their _new_ ones? After all, eating is very important; those who\nwouldn't simply refrain from eating would have to get jobs as\nmessengers, and errand boys, etc.--with the result that much of our\nfascinating modern Science Fiction would never be written!\n\nIt would be much cheaper for us to buy once-used material. It would\ngreatly reduce our task of carefully reading every story that comes to\nour office, in hopes to finding a fine, new story, or a potentially good\nauthor. But it would be very unwise, and very unfair, as you have seen.\n\nMany more reasons could be given, but these few are the more important\nones back of our policy of avoiding reprints. Enough said!--_The\nEditor._\n\n\n_Wants Reprints_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     In you April issue, in answer to a correspondent, you stated that\n     you were avoiding reprints. Now, that's too bad. Some of the best\n     Science-Fiction tales are reprints. Witness:\n\n     \"The Blind Spot,\" by Homer Eon Flint and Austin Hall; \"The War In\n     The Air,\" by H. G. Wells; \"The Purple Sapphire,\" by John Taine;\n     \"The Conquest of Mars,\" by Garrett P. Serviss; \"Darkness and Dawn,\"\n     and \"Into the Great Oblivion,\" and \"The After-Glow,\" and \"The\n     Air-Trust\"--all by George Allan England.\n\n     You are proud--and rightfully so--of your great author, Ray\n     Cummings. Why not give us several stories which helped to build his\n     glory? Here are several:\n\n     \"Tarranto the Conqueror,\" \"The Man on the Meteor,\" \"The Girl in the\n     Golden Atom,\" \"The Man Who Mastered Time,\" \"The Fire People.\"\n\n     Guess I'll sign off now and give the other fellows a\n     chance.--Isidore Manyon, 544 Myrtle Ave., Brooklyn, N. Y.\n\n\n_What Think You All?_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     There is one question I would like to ask. Perhaps some of the\n     other readers of Astounding Stories can answer it.\n\n     Could a person remember his own death in a former incarnation?\n     Some say \"no,\" and some say \"yes.\" If it is true that you can't,\n     the whole fabric of the wonderful story, one of the most beautiful,\n     if not the most beautiful I have ever read, \"The Moon Maid,\" by\n     Edgar Rice Burroughs, is built on a fallacy. You see, I am a\n     believer in reincarnation and I would surely like to correspond\n     with others who are also! Would not that also disprove the whole\n     theory of reincarnation if it is true? I think it is not true, but\n     I may be wrong. Is reincarnation a proven theory, or unproven?\n\n     You say you are going to avoid reprints. Now that is a mistake. Of\n     course, some you might avoid, such as those of Wells, Verne, etc.,\n     though I would like you to publish Wells' short stories. There are\n     many that have not been published in any magazine for a long time,\n     or at all.\n\n     But please, oh please, do publish A. Merritt's \"Through the Dragon\n     Glass,\" and give it a cover illustration. It is the only one, I\n     think, that I want particularly, but I do want it! If you publish\n     any of H. G. Wells' works, give them cover illustrations, too.\n\n     And publish a lot by Merritt, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and authors\n     like that; you haven't as yet printed a story of the type that A.\n     Merritt writes, and that is one thing this magazine needs, and lots\n     of them, as they are the cream of Science Fiction, and the more of\n     them you have, the better! They are my favorites, and next come\n     those that Edgar Rice Burroughs writes; also John Taine.--Worth K.\n     Bryant, 406 No. Third St., Yakima, Wash.\n\n\n_The S: Lynn Rhorer Society_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     This is to inform you that we have organized a society known as the\n     S. Lynn Rhorer Society of Greater Atlanta, a branch of the Science\n     Correspondence Club.\n\n     This Society's purpose is to first assist the Science\n     Correspondence Club and its affiliated branches in the promotion of\n     science and Scientific Fiction. Second, to create a greater\n     interest in science and Science Fiction among the laymen who are\n     already interested, and to create an interest among those who are\n     not at the present interested, and to hold their interest.\n\n     At the present time we have in our library over three hundred\n     scientific books; a large collection of ores and rocks from\n     different states and countries, classified; a large collection of\n     fossilized bones; a three-inch refracting telescope, and a ten-inch\n     one in the course of construction; and a large club-house.\n\n     Any information regarding this society can be obtained by\n     addressing R. A. Marks, Jr., 893 York Ave., S. W., Atlanta,\n     Georgia, or the undersigned.--F. B. Eason, 400 Jefferson Avenue, E.\n     Point, Ga.\n\n\n_Unused to the Smaller Size_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have but one comment on your magazine and that is: Having\n     complete sets of other Science Fiction magazines I would also like\n     to save Astounding Stories, but in its present size and condition\n     it looks like trash. Why not have a ballot to what size the\n     magazine shall be? By having the price raised to 25 cents it can\n     cover the extra expense. I would surely like to add another\n     magazine to my collection. Am hereby hoping you will do this for\n     the sake of Science Fiction lovers all over the country.--Sidney\n     Mack, 1676 59th Street, Brooklyn, New York.\n\n\n_\"The Scienceers\" Broadcasts_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     For the benefit of the readers of Astounding Stories who live in\n     New York, a club known as The Scienceers has recently been formed.\n     Its purpose is to promote informal fellowship among Science Fiction\n     fans and to foster discussion of modern developments, theories and\n     projects in the realm of science.\n\n     The organization is open to all persons over sixteen years of age\n     who are interested in Science Fiction and its relation to the\n     various fields of present day science. Since regular weekly\n     meetings are held, the membership is necessarily restricted to\n     residents of New York City and vicinity.\n\n     A cordial invitation to join the Scienceers is hereby extended to\n     all interested. Further information may be obtained by writing to\n     the undersigned.--Allen Glasser, 961 Forest Avenue, New York, N. Y.\n\n\n\"_Congratulations for Both_\"\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     Congratulations for us both. Your company for publishing this\n     magazine, myself for being able to buy same.\n\n     Have just finished reading the second issue. It is very good. I\n     read every story in both issues. You bet I am going to be a steady\n     reader from now on. I like this type of story very much--in fact,\n     read two other magazines that publish stories of this type every\n     month. I note with great pleasure that in the March issue you are\n     starting to publish the first quarter of an interplanetary story by\n     Ray Cummings. This is, indeed, good news. I have had the pleasure\n     of reading five of his novels this past year and I greatly enjoyed\n     all of them. Along with Edgar Rice Burroughs, Ray Cummings is an\n     \"ace high\" author on these \"unpredictable-future\" stories.\n\n     Some four or fives years ago I read in a magazine a portion of two\n     interplanetary stories by Ray Cummings. Now to the point, I wonder\n     if it is possible for you to obtain Mr. Cummings' permission to\n     have your company publish these two stories? Their names I believe\n     are \"Tarranto the Conquerer\" and \"Into the Fourth Dimension.\" I,\n     for one, would greatly appreciate this favor. Please do your best\n     to try and publish these novels this coming year. Thanks.--Wm. L.\n     Ebelan, 3906 Springdale Avenue, Baltimore, Md.\n\n\n_Likes the Small Size_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I received a pleasant surprise when I first bought your wonderful\n     magazine. I started in with the second issue, but I wish I could\n     get the first.\n\n     All the stories are good. The best of them, I think, is Ray\n     Cummings' story, \"Brigands of the Moon.\" I have read the first\n     three parts and am eagerly waiting for the last.\n\n     And now for something about the make-up of the magazine. I like the\n     small size, and holding the magazine together with two staples is\n     good.\n\n     The cover designs are very good, but the pictures inside could be\n     improved on. H. Wesso is a good artist.\n\n     How about publishing the magazine twice a month?--Charles Barrett,\n     135 Spring St., Woodbury, N. J.\n\n\n_Thanks, Anyhow!_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I hope that you are not going to have a blue cover every month. I\n     would like to see a different colored background every month. The\n     cover on the March issue should have been black because space is\n     black.\n\n     I wish that you would have a full-page picture for each story.\n     Wesso is the best artist you have. The others haven't enough\n     imagination.\n\n     I gave \"Brigands of the Moon\" by Ray Cummings first place in the\n     March issue of Astounding Stories. It promises to be his best story\n     since \"Tarrano the Conqueror.\"\n\n     The places of other stories are as follows: 2. \"Vandals of the\n     Stars\"; 3. \"The Soul Master\"; 4. \"Cold Light\"; 5. \"From the Ocean's\n     Depths.\"\n\n     If you would enlarge Astounding Stories to 11-3/4 by 8-1/2 it would\n     be seen more easily on the newsstands and its circulation would\n     increase. Please publish it on the first of the month instead of\n     the first Thursday.--Jack Darrow, 4225 N. Spaulding Avenue,\n     Chicago, Ill.\n\n\n\"_The Readers' Corner_\"\n\nAll Readers are extended a sincere and cordial invitation to \"come over\nin 'The Readers' Corner'\" and join in our monthly discussion of stories,\nauthors, scientific principles and possibilities--everything that's of\ncommon interest in connection with our Astounding Stories.\n\nAlthough from time to time the Editor may make a comment or so, this is\na department primarily for _Readers_, and we want you to make full use\nof it.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
