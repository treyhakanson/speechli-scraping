That's straight ahead to the sun with\n      the red rim around it.\"_\n\n     _But Dunbar's eyes were old and uncertain. How could they\n      believe in his choice when every star in this forsaken\n      section of space was surrounded by a beckoning red rim?_\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nThere was just blackness, frosty glimmering terrible blackness, going\nout and out forever in all directions. Russell didn't think they could\nremain sane in all this blackness much longer. Bitterly he thought of\nhow they would die--not knowing within maybe thousands of light years\nwhere they were, or where they were going.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAfter the wreck, the four of them had floated a while, floated and\ndrifted together, four men in bulbous pressure suits like small\nindividual rockets, held together by an awful pressing need for each\nother and by the \"gravity-rope\" beam.\n\nDunbar, the oldest of the four, an old space-buster with a face\nwrinkled like a dried prune, burned by cosmic rays and the suns of\nworlds so far away they were scarcely credible, had taken command.\nSuddenly, Old Dunbar had known where they were. Suddenly, Dunbar knew\nwhere they were going.\n\nThey could talk to one another through the etheric transmitters inside\ntheir helmets. They could live ... if this was living ... a long time,\nif only a man's brain would hold up, Russell thought. The suits were\ncomplete units. 700 pounds each, all enclosing shelters, with\natmosphere pressure, temperature control, mobility in space, and\nelectric power. Each suit had its own power-plant, reprocessing\ncontinuously the precious air breathed by the occupants, putting it\nback into circulation again after enriching it. Packed with food\nconcentrates. Each suit a rocket, each human being part of a rocket,\nand the special \"life-gun\" that went with each suit each blast of\nwhich sent a man a few hundred thousand miles further on toward\nwherever he was going.\n\nFour men, thought Russell, held together by an invisible string of\ngravity, plunging through a lost pocket of hell's dark where there had\nnever been any sound or life, with old Dunbar the first in line,\ntaking the lead because he was older and knew where he was and where\nhe was going. Maybe Johnson, second in line, and Alvar who was third,\nknew too, but were afraid to admit it.\n\nBut Russell knew it and he'd admitted it from the first--that old\nDunbar was as crazy as a Jovian juke-bird.\n\nA lot of time had rushed past into darkness. Russell had no idea now\nhow long the four of them had been plunging toward the red-rimmed sun\nthat never seemed to get any nearer. When the ultra-drive had gone\ncrazy the four of them had blanked out and nobody could say now how\nlong an interim that had been. Nobody knew what happened to a man who\nsuffered a space-time warping like that. When they had regained\nconsciousness, the ship was pretty banged up, and the meteor-repeller\nshields cracked. A meteor ripped the ship down the center like an old\nbreakfast cannister.\n\nHow long ago that had been, Russell didn't know. All Russell knew was\nthat they were millions of light years from any place he had ever\nheard about, where the galactic space lanterns had absolutely no\nrecognizable pattern. But Dunbar knew. And Russell was looking at\nDunbar's suit up ahead, watching it more and more intently, thinking\nabout how Dunbar looked inside that suit--and hating Dunbar more and\nmore for claiming he knew when he didn't, for his drooling\noptimism--because he was taking them on into deeper darkness and\ncalling their destination Paradise.\n\nRussell wanted to laugh, but the last time he'd given way to this\nimpulse, the results inside his helmet had been too unpleasant to\nrepeat.\n\nSometimes Russell thought of other things besides his growing hatred\nof the old man. Sometimes he thought about the ship, lost back there\nin the void, and he wondered if wrecked space ships were ever found.\nCompared with the universe in which one of them drifted, a wrecked\nship was a lot smaller than a grain of sand on a nice warm beach back\non Earth, or one of those specks of silver dust that floated like\nstrange seeds down the night winds of Venus.\n\nAnd a human was smaller still, thought Russell when he was not hating\nDunbar. Out here, a human being is the smallest thing of all. He\nthought then of what Dunbar would say to such a thought, how Dunbar\nwould laugh that high piping squawking laugh of his and say that the\nhuman being was bigger than the Universe itself.\n\nDunbar had a big answer for every little thing.\n\nWhen the four of them had escaped from that prison colony on a\nsizzling hot asteroid rock in the Ronlwhyn system, that wasn't enough\nfor Dunbar. Hell no--Dunbar had to start talking about a place they\ncould go where they'd never be apprehended, in a system no one else\nhad ever heard of, where they could live like gods on a green soft\nworld like the Earth had been a long time back.\n\nAnd Dunbar had spouted endlessly about a world of treasure they would\nfind, if they would just follow old Dunbar. That's what all four of\nthem had been trying to find all their lives in the big cold grabbag\nof eternity--a rich star, a rich far fertile star where no one else\nhad ever been, loaded with treasure that had no name, that no one had\never heard of before. And was, because of that, the richest treasure\nof all.\n\nWe all look alike out here in these big rocket pressure suits, Russell\nthought. No one for God only knew how many of millions of light years\naway could see or care. Still--we might have a chance to live, even\nnow, Russell thought--if it weren't for old crazy Dunbar.\n\nThey might have a chance if Alvar and Johnson weren't so damn lacking\nin self-confidence as to put all their trust in that crazed old\nrum-dum. Russell had known now for some time that they were going in\nthe wrong direction. No reason for knowing. Just a hunch. And Russell\nwas sure his hunch was right.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRussell said. \"Look--look to your left and to your right and behind\nus. Four suns. You guys see those other three suns all around you,\ndon't you?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" someone said.\n\n\"Well, if you'll notice,\" Russell said, \"the one on the left also now\nhas a red rim around it. Can't you guys see that?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I see it,\" Alvar said.\n\n\"So now,\" Johnson said, \"there's two suns with red rims around them.\"\n\n\"We're about in the middle of those four suns aren't we, Dunbar?\"\nRussell said.\n\n\"That's right, boys!\" yelled old Dunbar in that sickeningly optimistic\nvoice. Like a hysterical old woman's. \"Just about in the sweet dark\nold middle.\"\n\n\"You're still sure it's the sun up ahead ... that's the only one with\nlife on it, Dunbar ... the only one we can live on?\" Russell asked.\n\n\"That's right! That's right,\" Dunbar yelled. \"That's the only one--and\nit's a paradise. Not just a place to live, boys--but a place you'll\nhave trouble believing in because it's like a dream!\"\n\n\"And none of these other three suns have worlds we could live on,\nDunbar?\" Russell asked. Keep the old duck talking like this and maybe\nAlvar and Johnson would see that he was cracked.\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Alvar. \"You still say that, Dunbar?\"\n\n\"No life, boys, nothing,\" Dunbar laughed. \"Nothing on these other\nworlds but ashes ... just ashes and iron and dried blood, dried a\nmillion years or more.\"\n\n\"When in hell were you ever here?\" Johnson said. \"You say you were\nhere before. You never said when, or why or anything!\"\n\n\"It was a long time back boys. Don't remember too well, but it was\nwhen we had an old ship called the DOG STAR that I was here. A pirate\nship and I was second in command, and we came through this sector.\nThat was--hell, it musta' been fifty years ago. I been too many places\nnobody's ever bothered to name or chart, to remember where it is, but\nI been here. I remember those four suns all spotted to form a perfect\ncircle from this point, with us squarely in the middle. We explored\nall these suns and the worlds that go round 'em. Trust me, boys, and\nwe'll reach the right one. And that one's just like Paradise.\"\n\n\"Paradise is it,\" Russell whispered hoarsely.\n\n\"Paradise and there we'll be like gods, like Mercuries with wings\nflying on nights of sweet song. These other suns, don't let them\nbother you. They're Jezebels of stars. All painted up in the darkness\nand pretty and waiting and calling and lying! They make you think of\nnice green worlds all running waters and dews and forests thick as\nfleas on a wet dog. But it ain't there, boys. I know this place. I\nbeen here, long time back.\"\n\nRussell said tightly. \"It'll take us a long time won't it? If it's got\nair we can breath, and water we can drink and shade we can rest\nin--that'll be paradise enough for us. But it'll take a long time\nwon't it? And what if it isn't there--what if after all the time we\nspend hoping and getting there--there won't be nothing but ashes and\ncracked clay?\"\n\n\"I know we're going right,\" Dunbar said cheerfully. \"I can tell. Like\nI said--you can tell it because of the red rim around it.\"\n\n\"But the sun on our left, you can see--it's got a red rim too now,\"\nRussell said.\n\n\"Yeah, that's right,\" said Alvar. \"Sometimes I see a red rim around\nthe one we're going for, sometimes a red rim around that one on the\nleft. Now, sometimes I'm not sure either of them's got a red rim. You\nsaid that one had a red rim, Dunbar, and I wanted to believe it. So\nnow maybe we're all seeing a red rim that was never there.\"\n\nOld Dunbar laughed. The sound brought blood hotly to Russell's face.\n\"We're heading to the right one, boys. Don't doubt me ... I been here.\nWe explored all these sun systems. And I remember it all. The second\nplanet from that red-rimmed sun. You come down through a soft\natmosphere, floating like in a dream. You see the green lakes coming\nup through the clouds and the women dancing and the music playing. I\nremember seeing a ship there that brought those women there, a long\nlong time before ever I got there. A land like heaven and women like\nangels singing and dancing and laughing with red lips and arms white\nas milk, and soft silky hair floating in the winds.\"\n\nRussell was very sick of the old man's voice. He was at least glad he\ndidn't have to look at the old man now. His bald head, his skinny\nbobbing neck, his simpering watery blue eyes. But he still had to\nsuffer that immutable babbling, that idiotic cheerfulness ... and\nknowing all the time the old man was crazy, that he was leading them\nwrong.\n\nI'd break away, go it alone to the right sun, Russell thought--but I'd\nnever make it alone. A little while out here alone and I'd be nuttier\nthan old Dunbar will ever be, even if he keeps on getting nuttier all\nthe time.\n\nSomewhere, sometime then ... Russell got the idea that the only way\nwas to get rid of Dunbar.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You mean to tell us there are people living by that red-rimmed sun,\"\nRussell said.\n\n\"Lost people ... lost ... who knows how long,\" Dunbar said, as the\nfour of them hurtled along. \"You never know where you'll find people\non a world somewhere nobody's ever named or knows about. Places where\na lost ship's landed and never got up again, or wrecked itself so far\noff the lanes they'll never be found except by accident for millions\nof years. That's what this world is, boys. Must have been a ship load\nof beautiful people, maybe actresses and people like that being hauled\nto some outpost to entertain. They're like angels now, living in a\nland all free from care. Every place you see green forests and fields\nand blue lakes, and at nights there's three moons that come around the\nsky in a thousand different colors. And it never gets cold ... it's\nalways spring, always spring, boys, and the music plays all night,\nevery night of a long long year....\"\n\nRussell suddenly shouted. \"Keep quiet, Dunbar. Shut up will you?\"\n\nJohnson said. \"Dunbar--how long'll it take us?\"\n\n\"Six months to a year, I'd say,\" Dunbar yelled happily. \"That is--of\nour hereditary time.\"\n\n\"What?\" croaked Alvar.\n\nJohnson didn't say anything at all.\n\nRussell screamed at Dunbar, then quieted down. He whispered. \"Six\nmonths to a year--out here--cooped up in these damn suits. You're\ncrazy as hell, Dunbar. Crazy ... crazy! Nobody could stand it. We'll\nall be crazier than you are--\"\n\n\"We'll make it, boys. Trust ole' Dunbar. What's a year when we know\nwe're getting to Paradise at the end of it? What's a year out here ...\nit's paradise ain't it, compared with that prison hole we were rotting\nin? We can make it. We have the food concentrates, and all the rest.\nAll we need's the will, boys, and we got that. The whole damn Universe\nisn't big enough to kill the will of a human being, boys. I been over\na whole lot of it, and I know. In the old days--\"\n\n\"The hell with the old days,\" screamed Russell.\n\n\"Now quiet down, Russ,\" Dunbar said in a kind of dreadful crooning\nwhisper. \"You calm down now. You younger fellows--you don't look at\nthings the way we used to. Thing is, we got to go straight. People\ntrapped like this liable to start meandering. Liable to start losing\nthe old will-power.\"\n\nHe chuckled.\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Alvar. \"Someone says maybe we ought to go left, and\nsomeone says to go right, and someone else says to go in another\ndirection. And then someone says maybe they'd better go back the old\nway. An' pretty soon something breaks, or the food runs out, and\nyou're a million million miles from someplace you don't care about any\nmore because you're dead. All frozen up in space ... preserved like a\npiece of meat in a cold storage locker. And then maybe in a million\nyears or so some lousy insect man from Jupiter comes along and finds\nyou and takes you away to a museum....\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" Johnson yelled.\n\nDunbar laughed. \"Boys, boys, don't get panicky. Keep your heads. Just\nstick to old Dunbar and he'll see you through. I'm always lucky. Only\none way to go ... an' that's straight ahead to the sun with the\nred-rim around it ... and then we tune in the gravity repellers, and\ncoast down, floating and singing down through the clouds to\nparadise.\"\n\nAfter that they traveled on for what seemed months to Russell, but it\ncouldn't have been over a day or two of the kind of time-sense he had\ninherited from Earth.\n\nThen he saw how the other two stars also were beginning to develop red\nrims. He yelled this fact out to the others. And Alvar said. \"Russ's\nright. That sun to the right, and the one behind us ... now they ALL\nhave red rims around them. Dunbar--\" A pause and no awareness of\nmotion.\n\nDunbar laughed. \"Sure, they all maybe have a touch of red, but it\nisn't the same, boys. I can tell the difference. Trust me--\"\n\nRussell half choked on his words. \"You old goat! With those old eyes\nof yours, you couldn't see your way into a fire!\"\n\n\"Don't get panicky now. Keep your heads. In another year, we'll be\nthere--\"\n\n\"God, you gotta' be sure,\" Alvar said. \"I don't mind dyin' out here.\nBut after a year of this, and then to get to a world that was only\nashes, and not able to go any further--\"\n\n\"I always come through, boys. I'm lucky. Angel women will take us to\ntheir houses on the edges of cool lakes, little houses that sit there\nin the sun like fancy jewels. And we'll walk under colored fountains,\npretty colored fountains just splashing and splashing like pretty rain\non our hungry hides. That's worth waiting for.\"\n\nRussell did it before he hardly realized he was killing the old man.\nIt was something he had had to do for a long time and that made it\neasy. There was a flash of burning oxygen from inside the suit of\nDunbar. If he'd aimed right, Russell knew the fire-bullet should have\npierced Dunbar's back. Now the fire was gone, extinguished\nautomatically by units inside the suit. The suit was still inflated,\nself-sealing. Nothing appeared to have changed. The four of them\nhurtling on together, but inside that first suit up there on the front\nof the gravity rope, Dunbar was dead.\n\nHe was dead and his mouth was shut for good.\n\nDunbar's last faint cry from inside his suit still rang in Russell's\nears, and he knew Alvar and Johnson had heard it too. Alvar and\nJohnson both called Dunbar's name a few times. There was no answer.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Russ--you shouldn't have done that,\" Johnson whispered. \"You\nshouldn't have done that to the old man!\"\n\n\"No,\" Alvar said, so low he could barely be heard. \"You shouldn't have\ndone it.\"\n\n\"I did it for the three of us,\" Russell said. \"It was either him or us.\nLies ... lies that was all he had left in his crazy head. Paradise ...\ndon't tell me you guys don't see the red rims around all four suns, all\nfour suns all around us. Don't tell me you guys didn't know he was batty,\nthat you really believed all that stuff he was spouting all the time!\"\n\n\"Maybe he was lying, maybe not,\" Johnson said. \"Now he's dead anyway.\"\n\n\"Maybe he was wrong, crazy, full of lies,\" Alvar said. \"But now he's\ndead.\"\n\n\"How could he see any difference in those four stars?\" Russell said,\nlouder.\n\n\"He thought he was right,\" Alvar said. \"He wanted to take us to\nparadise. He was happy, nothing could stop the old man--but he's dead\nnow.\"\n\nHe sighed.\n\n\"He was taking us wrong ... wrong!\" Russell screamed. \"Angels--music\nall night--houses like jewels--and women like angels--\"\n\n\"_Shhhh_,\" said Alvar. It was quiet. How could it be so quiet, Russell\nthought? And up ahead the old man's pressure suit with a corpse inside\nwent on ahead, leading the other three at the front of the\ngravity-rope.\n\n\"Maybe he was wrong,\" Alvar said. \"But now do we know which way is\nright?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSometime later, Johnson said, \"We got to decide now. Let's forget the\nold man. Let's forget him and all that's gone and let's start now and\ndecide what to do.\"\n\nAnd Alvar said, \"Guess he was crazy all right, and I guess we trusted\nhim because we didn't have the strength to make up our own minds. Why\ndoes a crazy man's laugh sound so good when you're desperate and don't\nknow what to do?\"\n\n\"I always had a feeling we were going wrong,\" Johnson said. \"Anyway,\nit's forgotten, Russ. It's swallowed up in the darkness all around.\nIt's never been.\"\n\nRussell said, \"I've had a hunch all along that maybe the old man was\nhere before, and that he was right about there being a star here with\na world we can live on. But I've known we was heading wrong. I've had\na hunch all along that the right star was the one to the left.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Johnson sighed. \"I been feeling partial toward that\none on the right. What about you, Alvar?\"\n\n\"I always thought we were going straight in the opposite direction\nfrom what we should, I guess. I always wanted to turn around and go\nback. It won't make over maybe a month's difference. And what does a\nmonth matter anyway out here--hell there never was any time out here\nuntil we came along. We make our own time here, and a month don't\nmatter to me.\"\n\nSweat ran down Russell's face. His voice trembled. \"No--that's wrong.\nYou're both wrong.\" He could see himself going it alone. Going crazy\nbecause he was alone. He'd have broken away, gone his own direction,\nlong ago but for that fear.\n\n\"How can we tell which of us is right?\" Alvar said. \"It's like\neverything was changing all the time out here. Sometimes I'd swear\nnone of those suns had red rims, and at other times--like the old man\nsaid, they're all pretty and lying and saying nothing, just changing\nall the time. Jezebel stars, the old man said.\"\n\n\"I know I'm right,\" Russell pleaded. \"My hunches always been right.\nMy hunch got us out of that prison didn't it? Listen--I tell you it's\nthat star to the left--\"\n\n\"The one to the right,\" said Johnson.\n\n\"We been going away from the right one all the time,\" said Alvar.\n\n\"We got to stay together,\" said Russell. \"Nobody could spend a year\nout here ... alone....\"\n\n\"Ah ... in another month or so we'd be lousy company anyway,\" Alvar\nsaid. \"Maybe a guy could get to the point where he'd sleep most of the\ntime ... just wake up enough times to give himself another boost with\nthe old life-gun.\"\n\n\"We got to face it,\" Johnson said finally. \"We three don't go on\ntogether any more.\"\n\n\"That's it,\" said Alvar. \"There's three suns that look like they might\nbe right seeing as how we all agree the old man was wrong. But we\nbelieve there is one we can live by, because we all seem to agree that\nthe old man might have been right about that. If we stick together,\nthe chance is three to one against us. But if each of us makes for one\nstar, one of us has a chance to live. Maybe not in paradise like the\nold man said, but a place where we can live. And maybe there'll be\nintelligent life, maybe even a ship, and whoever gets the right star\ncan come and help the other two....\"\n\n\"No ... God no....\" Russell whispered over and over. \"None of us can\never make it alone....\"\n\nAlvar said, \"We each take the star he likes best. I'll go back the\nother way. Russ, you take the left. And you, Johnson, go to the\nright.\"\n\nJohnson started to laugh. Russell was yelling wildly at them, and\nabove his own yelling he could hear Johnson's rising laughter. \"Every\nguy's got a star of his own,\" Johnson said when he stopped laughing.\n\"And we got ours. A nice red-rimmed sun for each of us to call his\nvery own.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Alvar said. \"We cut off the gravity rope, and each to his own\nsun.\"\n\nNow Russell wasn't saying anything.\n\n\"And the old man,\" Alvar said, \"can keep right on going toward what he\nthought was right. And he'll keep on going. Course he won't be able to\ngive himself another boost with the life-gun, but he'll keep going.\nSomeday he'll get to that red-rimmed star of his. Out here in space,\nonce you're going, you never stop ... and I guess there isn't any\nother body to pull him off his course. And what will time matter to\nold Dunbar? Even less than to us, I guess. He's dead and he won't\ncare.\"\n\n\"Ready,\" Johnson said. \"I'll cut off the gravity rope.\"\n\n\"I'm ready,\" Alvar said. \"To go back toward whatever it was I started\nfrom.\"\n\n\"Ready, Russ?\"\n\nRussell couldn't say anything. He stared at the endless void which now\nhe would share with no one. Not even crazy old Dunbar.\n\n\"All right,\" Johnson said. \"Good-bye.\"\n\nRussell felt the release, felt the sudden inexplicable isolation and\naloneness even before Alvar and Johnson used their life-guns and shot\nout of sight, Johnson toward the left and Alvar back toward that other\nred-rimmed sun behind them.\n\nAnd old Dunbar shooting right on ahead. And all three of them\ndwindling and dwindling and blinking out like little lights.\n\nFading, he could hear their voices. \"Each to his own star,\" Johnson\nsaid. \"On a bee line.\"\n\n\"On a bee line,\" Alvar said.\n\nRussell used his own life-gun and in a little while he didn't hear\nAlvar or Johnson's voices, nor could he see them. They were thousands\nof miles away, and going further all the time.\n\nRussell's head fell forward against the front of his helmet, and he\nclosed his eyes. \"Maybe,\" he thought, \"I shouldn't have killed the old\nman. Maybe one sun's as good as another....\"\n\nThen he raised his body and looked out into the year of blackness that\nwaited for him, stretching away to the red-rimmed sun. Even if he were\nright--he was sure now he'd never make it alone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe body inside the pressure suit drifted into a low-level orbit\naround the second planet from the sun of its choice, and drifted there\na long time. A strato-cruiser detected it by chance because of the\nstrong concentration of radio-activity that came from it.\n\nThey took the body down to one of the small, quiet towns on the edge\nof one of the many blue lakes where the domed houses were like bright\njoyful jewels. They got the leathery, well-preserved body from the\npressure suit.\n\n\"An old man,\" one of them mused. \"A very old man. From one of the lost\nsectors. I wonder how and why he came so very far from his home?\"\n\n\"Wrecked a ship out there, probably,\" one of the others said. \"But he\nmanaged to get this far. It looks as though a small meteor fragment\npierced his body. Here. You see?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" another of them said. \"But what amazes me is that this old man\npicked this planet out of all the others. The only one in this entire\nsector that would sustain life.\"\n\n\"Maybe he was just a very lucky old man. Yes ... a man who attains\nsuch an age was usually lucky. Or at least that is what they say about\nthe lost sectors.\"\n\n\"Maybe he knew the way here. Maybe he was here before--sometime.\"\n\nThe other shook his head. \"I don't think so. They say some humans from\nthat far sector did land here--but that's probably only a myth. And if\nthey did, it was well over a thousand years ago.\"\n\nAnother said. \"He has a fine face, this old man. A noble face. Whoever\nhe is ... wherever he came from, he died bravely and he knew the way,\nthough he never reached this haven of the lost alive.\"\n\n\"Nor is it irony that he reached here dead,\" said the Lake Chieftain.\nHe had been listening and he stepped forward and raised his arm. \"He\nwas old. It is obvious that he fought bravely, that he had great\ncourage, and that he knew the way. He will be given a burial suitable\nto his stature, and he will rest here among the brave.\n\n\"Let the women dance and the music play for this old man. Let the\ntrumpets speak, and the rockets fly up.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
