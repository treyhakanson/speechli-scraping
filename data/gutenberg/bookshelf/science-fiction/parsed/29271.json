F. BONE\n\n\n _Lincoln said it eons ago.... It took\n a speck of one-celled plant life on a\n  world parsecs away to prove it for\n           all the galaxy._\n\n\nThe following manuscript was discovered during the excavation of a\nlateral connecting link between the North-South streamways in Narhil\nProvince near Issahar on Kwashior. The excavator, while passing through\na small valley about 20 yursts south of the city, was jammed by a mass\nof oxidized and partially oxidized metallic fragments. On most worlds\nthis would not be unusual, but Kwashior has no recorded history of\nmetallic artifacts. The terrestrial operator, with unusual presence of\nmind, reported the stoppage immediately. Assasul, the District\nEngineering monitor, realized instantly that no metallic debris should\nexist in that area, and in consequence ordered a most careful excavation\nin the event that the artifacts might have cultural significance.\n\nThe debris proved to be the remnants of an ancient spaceship similar to\nthose described in Sector Chronicles IV through VII, but of much smaller\nsize and cruder design--obviously a relic of pre-expansion days. Within\nthe remnants of the ship was found a small box of metal covered with\nseveral thicknesses of tar and wax impregnated fabric which had been\nmostly destroyed. The metal itself was badly oxidized, but served to\nprotect an inner wooden box that contained a number of thin sheets of a\nfragile substance composed mainly of cellulose which were brown and\ncrumbling with age. The sheets were covered with runes of _lingua\nantiqua_ arranged in regular rows, inscribed by hand with a carbon-based\nink which has persisted remarkably well despite the degenerative\nprocesses of time. Although much of the manuscript is illegible,\nsufficient remains to settle for all time the Dannar-Marraket\nControversy and lend important corroborating evidence to the Cassaheb\nThesis of Terrestrial migrations.\n\nThe genuineness of this fragment has been established beyond doubt.\nRadiocarbon dating places its age at ten thousand plus or minus one\nhundred cycles, which would place it at the very beginning of the\nIntellectual Emergence. Its importance is beyond question. Its\nimplications are shocking despite the fact that they conform to many of\nthe early legends and form a solid foundation for Dannar's Thesis which\nhas heretofore been regarded as implausible. In the light of this\nmaterial, the whole question of racial origins may well have to be\nreevaluated. Without further comment, the translated text is presented\nherewith. You may draw your own conclusions. Go with enlightenment.\n\n                                -BARRAGOND-\n                                Monitor of Cultural Origins and Relics\n                                Kwashior Central Repository\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI have decided after some thought, to write this journal. It is, I\nsuppose, a form of egotism--for I do not expect that it shall ever be\nread in the event that I am unable to leave this place. Yet it affords\nme a certain satisfaction to think that a part of me will remain long\nafter I have returned to dust. In any event, I feel that one is not\ntruly dead if a part of his personality remains. Many of the ancients\nsuch as Homer, Phidias, Confucius, Christ, da Vinci, Lincoln, Einstein,\nChurchill--and many others--live on through their works when otherwise\nthey would long since have been forgotten and thus be truly dead.\nEarth's history is full of such examples. And while I have no\nexpectation of an immortality such as theirs, it flatters my ego to\nthink that there will be some part of me which also will survive ...\n\n_(Note: There are several lines following this which are obliterated,\ndefaced or unreadable. There are more to follow. In the future such gaps\nin the content will be indicated thus: ...)_\n\n... I expect that it is a basic trait of character, for spacemen must be\ngregarious, and although I am not truly a spaceman I have been in space\nand, in consequence, my character is no different from my\nex-crewmates--at least in that respect. I think as time passes I shall\nmiss the comfort of companionship, the sense of belonging to a group,\nthe card games, the bull sessions, the endless speculation on what comes\nnext, or what we will do when the voyage is over and we are again on\nEarth ...\n\n... I particularly recall Gregory. Odd, but I never knew his surname, or\nmaybe it was his given name, for Gregory could function as well in one\nrespect as the other. He would boast continually of what he would do to\nwine, women, and song once we returned to Earth. Poor Gregory. The\nmeteor that hulled our ship struck squarely through the engine room\nwhere he was on duty. Probably he never knew that he had died. At least\nhis fate had the mercy of being brief. Certainly it is not like mine. It\nwas ... given ...\n\nThere was plenty of time for the survivors to reach the lifeboats, and\nin our decimated condition there were plenty of boats--which increased\nour chances of living by a factor of four ... I suppose that it was\nfoolish to give way to the feeling of every man for himself but I am not\na spaceman trained to react automatically to emergencies. Neither am I a\nnavigator or a pilot, although I can fly in an emergency. I am a\nbiologist, a specialist member of the scientific staff--essentially an\nindividualist. I knew enough to seal myself in, push the eject button\nand energize the drive. However, I did not know that a lifeboat had no\nacceleration compensators, and by the time the drive lever returned to\nneutral, I was far out in space and thoroughly lost. I could detect no\nlifeboats in the vicinity nor could I raise any on the radio. I later\nfound that a transistor malfunctioned, but by then I was well out of\nrange, stranded between the stars in the black emptiness of space. After\nreading the manual on lifeboat operation there was but one course open.\nI selected the nearest G-type star, set the controls on automatic, and\nwent into cold sleep. There was nothing else to do. If I remained awake\nI would be dead of oxygen starvation long before I reached a habitable\nworld. The only alternative was the half-death of frozen sleep and the\nlong wait until the boat came within range of the sun I had selected.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI awoke in orbit around this world, and after I recovered full use of my\nfaculties and checked the analyzer, I decided to land. I'm afraid I did\na rather bad job of it, since I used the chemical rockets too late, and\nthe plasma jets scorched a considerable amount of acreage in the meadow\nwhere I finally came to rest. However, the residual radioactivity is\nlow, and it is safe enough to walk outside.... The life boat is lying\nbeside a small stream which empties into a circular pool of blue water\nin the center of a small meadow. The fiery trail of the jets and rockets\nhas burned a hundred-foot-wide path across the meadow, and the upper\nedge of the pool, and ends in a broad, blackened circle surrounding the\nboat. I came down too fast the last few feet, and the drive tubes are a\ncrumpled mess inextricably fused with the bent landing pads. This boat\nwill never fly again without extensive repairs which I cannot perform.\nBut the hull is otherwise sound, and I am comfortable enough except for\na few rapidly healing bruises and contusions. In a few days I should be\nwell enough to explore....\n\nI am surprised that this world is so capable of supporting human life.\nThe consensus of scientific opinion has been that less than one out of\n50,000 planets would be habitable. Yet I have struck paydirt on the\nfirst try. Perhaps I am lucky. At any rate I am alive, and my lifeboat,\nwhile somewhat damaged by an inept landing, is still sufficiently intact\nto serve as a shelter, and the survival kits are undamaged, which should\nmake my stay here endurable if not pleasant ... and we are learning a\ngreat deal about our galaxy with the development of the interstellar\ndrive--not the least of which is that authoritative opinion is mere\nopinion and far from authoritative.\n\nThis world on which I find myself is in every respect but one similar to\nEarth. There is no animate life--only plants. No birds fly, no insects\nbuzz, no animals rustle the silent underbrush. The only noise is the\nwind in the trees and grasses. I am utterly alone. It is a strange\nfeeling, this loneliness. There is a feeling of freedom in it, a release\nfrom the too-close proximity of my fellow men. There is the pleasure of\nabsolute privacy. But this will undoubtedly pall. Already I find that I\nam anxious for someone to talk to, someone with whom I can share ideas\nand plans. There ...\n\n... which I cannot explain. But one thing is certain. My first\nimpression of this place was wrong. The life here, if not animate, is at\nleast intelligent--and it is not friendly. Yet neither does it hate. It\nobserves me with a slow, methodical curiosity that I can sense at the\nvery threshold of consciousness. It is a peculiar sensation that is\nquite indescribable--unpleasant--but hardly terrifying. I suppose I can\nfeel it more than a normal person because I am a biologist and it is\npart of my training and specialized skill to achieve a certain rapport\nwith my surroundings. I first noticed it yesterday. It came suddenly,\nwithout warning, a vague uneasiness, like the feeling when one awakens\nfrom a partially remembered but unpleasant dream. And it has been\nincreasing ever since.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe principal impressions I received from this initial contact were an\nawareness of self and a recognizance of identity--the concept of _cogito\nergo sum_ came through quite clearly. I wonder what Descartes would\nthink of an alien intelligence quoting his dogma.... I think it is\nanimal, despite the absence of animal life in this area. The thought\npatterns are quick and flexible. And they have been increasing in power\nand precision at an appreciable rate. I am sure that it is aware of me.\nI shall call the feeling \"it\" until I can identify the source more\naccurately. Certainly \"it\" appears to be as good a description as any,\nsince there is no consciousness of sex in the thought patterns. I wonder\nwhat sort of ... and to my surprise I _swore_! I do not ordinarily\ncurse or use obscenities--not because they are obscene but because they\nare a poor and inexact means of conveying ideas or impressions. But in\nthis case they were particularly appropriate. No other words could so\nprecisely describe my feelings. Me, a rational intelligence, succumbing\nto such low-level emotional stimuli! If this keeps on, the next thing I\nknow I will be seeing little green men flitting through the trees.... Of\ncourse, this world is unnatural, which makes its effect on the nervous\nsystem more powerful, yet that does not explain the feeling of tension\nwhich I have been experiencing, the silent straining tension of an\noverloaded cable, the tension of a toy balloon overfull with air. I have\na constant feeling of dreadful expectancy, of imminent disaster, mixed\nwith a sense of pain and a lively--almost childlike--curiosity. To say\nthat this is disquieting would be a complete understatement, this state\nof chronic disease, mixed with occasional rushes of terror. I am certain\nthat my nervous system and emotional responses are being examined, and\ncatalogued like a visceral preparation in an anatomy laboratory. There\nis something infinitely chilling about this mental dissection.\n\n... and after a careful search of the area I found precisely nothing.\nYou who may read this will probably laugh, but I cannot. To me this is\nno laughing matter. I find myself jumping at the slightest noise, an\nincrease in the wind, the snap of an expanding hull plate, the crackle\nof static over my radio. I whirl around to see who, or _what_, is\nwatching me. My skin crawls and prickles as though I were covered with\nants. My mind is filled with black, inchoate dread. In three words, _I'm\nscared stiff_! Yet there is nothing tangible--nothing I should be\nfrightened about, and this terrifies me even more. For I know where this\ncontinual fear and worry can lead--to what ends this incessant\nstimulation can reach.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnder pressure my body reacts, preparing me to fight or flee. My\nadrenals pump hormones into my bloodstream, stimulating my heart and my\nsympathetic nervous system, making glucose more available to my muscles.\nMy peripheral capillaries dilate. Intestinal activity stops as blood is\nchanneled into the areas which my fear and my glands decide will need it\nmost. I sweat. My vision blurs. All the manifold changes of the fight or\nflight syndrome are mobilized for instant action. But my body cannot be\nheld in this state of readiness. The constant stimulation will\nultimately turn my overworked adrenal glands into a jelly-like mess of\ncystic quivering goo. My general adaptation syndrome will no longer\nadapt. And I will die.\n\nBut I am not dead yet. And I have certain advantages. I am intelligent.\nI know what faces me. And I can adjust. That is one of the outstanding\ncharacteristics of the human race--the ability to adjust to our\nenvironment, or, failing that, to adjust our environment to us. In\naddition, I have my hands, tools, and materials to work with here in the\nlifeboat. And finally I am desperate! I should be able to accomplish\nsomething. There must be ...\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n... But it is not going well. There are too many parts which I do not\nknow by sight. If I were a more competent electronicist I would have had\nthe parts assembled now and would be sending a beacon signal clear\nacross this sector. The pressure hasn't been any help. It doesn't get\ngreater, but it has become more insisting--more demanding. I seem to\nfeel that it _wants_ something, that its direction has become more\nchannelized. The conviction is growing within me that I am destined to\nbe _absorbed_.\n\nThe fear with which I live is a constant thing. And I still keep looking\nfor my enemy. In a strange, impersonal way it has become my enemy for\nthough it does not hate, it threatens my life. My waking hours are hell\nand my sleep is nightmare. Strange how a man clings to life and sanity.\nIt would be so easy to lose either. Of one thing I am certain--this\ncannot go on much longer. I cannot work under pressure. I must act. I\nshall try again to find my enemy and kill it before it kills me. It is\nno longer a question of ...\n\n... Never again shall I wish to be alone. If I get out of this alive I\nam going to haunt crowds. I will surround myself with people. Right now\nI would give my soul to have one--just one--person near me. Anyone. I\nfeel certain that two of us could face this thing and lick it. If\nnecessary we could face it back to back, each covering the other. I am\nnow getting impressions. Sensory hallucinations. I am floating. I swim.\nI bathe luxuriantly in huge bathtubs and the water runs through my body\nas though I were a sponge. Have you ever felt _porous_?...\n\n... and that last attack was a doozer! I wrecked a week's work looking\nfor the little man who wasn't there. The urge to kill is becoming more\nintense. I want to destroy the author of my misery. Even though I am\nstill a balanced personality--polite language for being sane--I can't\ntake much more of this. I will not go mad, but I will go into the\nadrenal syndrome unless I can end this soon.\n\nNothing I have done seems to help. For a while I was sure that the music\ntapes held the pressure back, but the enemy is used to them now. I am\nstill working on the subspace beacon. The radio and most of the control\nlinkages have gone into it. It looks like an electronicist's nightmare,\nbut if the survival manual is right, it will work. It has to work! I\ndread the time when I shall have to cannibalize the recorder. Can't\nhelp thinking that Shakespeare was right when he wrote that bit about\nmusic soothing the savage breast. It may not soothe the enemy, for it\nisn't savage, but it certainly soothes me, even though there's something\nrepetitive about it after a half a hundred playings. My breast's savage\nall right. Fact is, it's downright primitive when an attack starts. I\ncan feel them coming now. I keep wondering how much longer I can last.\nGuess I'm getting morbid....\n\nMore nightmares last night. I drowned three times and a purple octopus\ngave me an enema. Woke up screaming, but got an idea from it. Funny that\nI never thought of it before. Water's the fountainhead of life, and\nthere is no real reason for assuming my enemy is terrestrial. He could\njust as well be aquatic. I'll find out today--maybe. Just to be doing\nsomething positive--even thinking--makes me feel better....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Got it!_ I know where it is! And I know how to kill it. Fact is, I've\nalready done it! Now there's no more pressure. God--what a relief! This\nmorning I burned the meadow and cut down the nearest trees surrounding\nthis clearing and nothing happened. I expected that. Then I checked the\nwater. Nothing in the stream, but the pond was _green_!--filled almost\nto the edge with a mass of algae! A hundred-foot platter of sticky green\nslime, cohesive as glue and ugly as sin. It _had_ to be it--and it was.\nI never saw algae that cohered quite like that. So I gave it about fifty\ngallons of rocket juice--red fuming nitric acid--right in the belly.\nThen I sat down and let the tension flow out of me, revelling in its\npain, laughing like crazy as it turned brown--and the pressure\ndisappeared. No tension at all now. The place is as quiet and peaceful\nas the grave. I want to laugh and laugh--and run through the burned\nmeadow and roll in the ashes so grateful am I for my deliverance.\n\nGot the idea of killing the monster from a splash of rocket fuel on the\nbank of the stream and my memory of the pain in the early feelings. But\nit was nothing compared to the feeling when the acid hit that damned\nmass of green slime! Even though my brain was screaming at me, I felt\ngood. I should put a couple of hundred gallons into the stream just to\nmake sure--but I can't afford it. I need the fuel to run the generators\nto propagate the wave that'll bring me home if someone hears it. And\nthey'll hear it all right. My luck is in. Now I'm going to sleep--_sweet\nsleep that knits the ravelled sleeve of care_--Shakespeare, old man, you\nhad a phrase for everything! I love you. I love everything. I even feel\nsorry for that poor plant ... of guilt. It couldn't help the fact that\nmy jets set up a mutation. And being intelligent it _had_ to be\ncurious. Of course, no one would believe me if I started talking about\nintelligent algae. But what's so odd about that? Even the most complex\nlife forms are just aggregations of individual cells working together.\nSo if a few individual cells with rudimentary data-storage capacity got\nthe idea of uniting why couldn't they act like a complex organism?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt is useless to speculate on what might have happened had that thing\nlived. But it's dead now--burned to death in acid. And although\ndestruction of intelligent life is repugnant to me, I cannot help\nfeeling that it is perhaps better that it is gone. Considering how\nrapidly it developed during its few weeks of life, and the power it\npossessed, my mind is appalled at its potential. I've had my experience\nand that's enough. Lord! but I'm tired. I feel like a wrung-out sponge.\nGuess I'll rest for a little while ...\n\n... and received a reply to my signal! They heterodyned it right back\nalong my own beam. They'll be landing in a week. I don't think I'll take\nthis manuscript with me. I couldn't use it--and somehow I don't feel\nlike burning it. Maybe I'll make a time capsule out of it. It will be\namusing to speculate about what sort of a reaction it'll provoke,\nproviding it is ever read. I can see them now, huge-headed humans,\nwrinkling their noses and saying \"Intelligent algae--fantastic--the man\nmust have been mad!\"\n\n_The manuscript ends here--and of course we know that the \"man\" was not\nmad. He left behind a rich heritage indeed, for those few cells that\nescaped his wrath and floated down to the sea. Did we but know his\norigin we would erect a suitable memorial if we had to travel to the\nfarthest reach of our galaxy. But the names he quotes are not in our\nrepositories and as for the word \"Earth\" which he used for his\nhomeworld, I need not remind my readers that the intelligent terrestrial\ninhabitants of the 22,748 planets of this sector use the term \"Earth\" or\nits synonyms \"soil\" and \"world\" to describe their planets. Of course,\nthe term \"Homewater\" is gradually replacing this archaic concept as we\nextend our hegemony ever more widely across the disunited worlds of the\ngalaxy._\n\n_At that it seems strange that the unknown author's race should have\npassed. As individuals they had so many advantages, while we are so weak\nand individually so helpless. They could do almost everything except\ncommunicate and cooperate. We can do but little else, yet our larger\naggregations can control entire worlds, some peopled perhaps with\ndescendants of this very individual. It merely proves that Dannar's\nstatement in the preface of his Thesis is correct._\n\n\"United, cohesive cooperation is the source of irresistible strength.\"\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Science Fiction Stories_ April\n    1960.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
