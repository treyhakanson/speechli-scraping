The profound influence of civilian morale upon the\n    course of modern war is nowhere more clearly shown than\n    in the case of that monstrous war-engine popularly\n    known as a 'Wabbly.' It landed in New Jersey Aug. 16,\n    1942, and threw the whole Eastern Coast into a frenzy.\n    In six hours the population of three States was in a\n    panic. Industry was paralyzed. The military effect was\n    comparable only to a huge modern army landed in our\n    rear....\" (_Strategic Lessons of the War of\n    1941-43._--U. S. War College. Pp. 79-80.)\n\n\nSergeant Walpole made his daily report at 2:15. He used a dinky\ntelephone that should have been in a museum, and a rural Central put him\non the Area Officer's tight beam. The Area Officer listened drearily as\nthe Sergeant said in a military manner:\n\n    [Illustration: _It spouted a flash of bluish flame._]\n\n\"Sergeant Walpole, sir, Post Fourteen, reports that he has nothing of\nimportance to report.\"\n\n    +--------------------------------------------------+\n    |The Wabbly, uncombatable engine of war, spreads   |\n    |unparalleled death and destruction--until Sergeant|\n    |Walpole \"strikes at the morale\" of its crew.      |\n    +--------------------------------------------------+\n\nThe Area Officer's acknowledgment was curt; embittered. For he was an\nenergetic young man, and he loathed his job. He wanted to be in the\nwest, where fighting of a highly unconventional nature was taking place\ndaily. He did not enjoy this business of watching an unthreatened\ncoast-line simply for the maintenance of civilian confidence and morale.\nHe preferred fighting.\n\nSergeant Walpole, though, exhaled a lungful of smoke at the telephone\ntransmitter and waited. Presently the rural Central said:\n\n\"All through?\"\n\n\"Sure, sweetie,\" said Sergeant Walpole. \"How about the talkies tonight?\"\n\nThat was at 2:20 P. M. There was coy conversation, while the civilian\ntelephone-service suffered. Then Sergeant Walpole went back to his post\nof duty with a date for the evening. He never kept that date, as it\nturned out. The rural Central was dead an hour after the first and only\nWabbly landed, and as everybody knows, that happened at 2:45.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut Sergeant Walpole had no premonitions as he went back to his hammock\non the porch. This was Post Number Fourteen, Sixth Area, Eastern Coast\nObservation Force. There was a war on, to be sure. There had been a war\non since the fall of 1941, but it was two thousand miles away. Even\nlone-wolf bombing planes, flying forty thousand feet up, never came this\nfar to drop their eggs upon inviting targets or upon those utterly\nblank, innocent-seeming places where munitions of war were now\nmanufactured underground.\n\nHere was peace and quiet and good rations and a paradise for\ngold-brickers. Here was a summer bungalow taken over for military\npurposes, quartering six men who watched a certain section of coast-line\nfor a quite impossible enemy. Three miles to the south there was another\npost. Three miles to the north another one still. They stretched all\nalong the Atlantic Coast, those observation-posts, and the men in them\nwatched the sea, languidly observed the television broadcasts, and slept\nin the sun. That was all they were supposed to do. In doing it they\nhelped to maintain civilian morale. And therefore the Eastern Coast\nObservation Force was enviously said to be \"just attached to the Army\nfor rations,\" by the other services, and its members rated with M. P.'s\nand other low forms of animal life.\n\nSergeant Walpole reclined in his hammock, inhaling comfortably. The\nocean glittered blue before him in the sun. There was a plume of smoke\nout at sea indicating an old-style coal-burner, its hull down below the\nhorizon. Anything that would float was being used since the war began,\nthough a coal-burning ship was almost a museum piece. A trim Diesel\ntramp was lazing northward well inshore. A pack of gulls were squabbling\nnoisily over some unpleasantness floating a hundred yards from the\nbeach. The Diesel tramp edged closer inshore still. It was all very\npeaceful and placid. There are few softer jobs on earth than being a\nmember of a \"force in being\" for the sake of civilian morale.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut at 2:32 P. M. the softness of that job departed, as far as Sergeant\nWalpole was concerned. At that moment he heard a thin wailing sound high\naloft. It was well enough known nearer the front, but the Eastern Coast\nObservation Force had had no need to become unduly familiar with it.\nWith incredible swiftness the wailing rose to the shrillest of shrieks,\ndescending as lightning might be imagined to descend. Then there was a\nshattering concussion. It was monstrous. It was ear-splitting. Windows\ncrashed in the cottage and tinkled to the sandy earth outside. There was\na pause of seconds' duration only, during which Sergeant Walpole stared\nblankly and gasped, \"What the hell?\" Then there was a second thin\nwailing which rose to a scream....\n\nSergeant Walpole was in motion before the second explosion came. He was\ndiving off the veranda of Post Number Fourteen. He saw someone else\ncoming through a window. He had a photographic glimpse of one of his men\nemerging through a doorway. Then he struck earth and began to run. Like\neverybody else in America, he knew what the explosions and the\nscreamings meant.\n\nBut he had covered no more than fifty yards when the third bomb fell\nfrom that plane so far aloft that it was not even a mote in the sky. Up\nthere the sky was not even blue, but a dull leaden gray because of the\nthinness of the atmosphere yet above it. The men in that high-flight\nbomber could see the ground only as a mass of vaguely blending colors.\nThey were aiming their bombs by filtered light, through telescopes which\nused infra-red rays only, as aerial cameras did back in the 1920's. And\nthey were sighting their eggs with beautifully exact knowledge of their\nvelocity and height. By the time the bombs had dropped eight miles they\nwere traveling faster than the sound of their coming. The first two had\nwiped out Posts Thirteen and Fifteen. The third made no sound before it\nlanded, except to an observer at a distance. Sergeant Walpole heard\nneither the scream of fall nor the sound of its explosion.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was running madly, and suddenly the earth bucked violently beneath\nhis feet, and he had a momentary sensation of things flying madly by\nover his head, and then he knew nothing at all for a very long time.\nThen his head ached horribly and someone was popping at something\nvalorously with a rifle, and he heard the nasty sharp explosions of the\nhexynitrate bullets which have remodeled older ideas of warfare, and\nSergeant Walpole was aware of an urgent necessity to do something, but\nhe could not at all imagine what it was. Then a shell went off, the\nearth-concussion banged his nose against the sand, and the rifle-fire\nstopped.\n\n\"For Gawd's sake!\" said Sergeant Walpole dizzily.\n\nHe staggered to his feet and looked behind him. Where the cottage had\nbeen there was a hole. Quite a large hole. It was probably a hundred\nyards across and all of twenty deep, but sea-water was seeping in to\nfill it through the sand. Its edge was forty or fifty feet from where he\nstood. He had been knocked down by the heaving earth, and the sand and\nmud blown out of the crater had gone clean over him. Twenty feet back,\nthe top part of his body would have been cut neatly off by the blast. As\nit was....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe found his nose bleeding and plugged it with his handkerchief. He was\nstill rather dazed, and he still had the feeling that there was\nsomething extremely important that he must do. He stood rocking on his\nfeet, trying to clear his head, when two men came along the sand-dunes\nbehind the beach. One of them carried two automatic rifles. The other\nwas trying to bandage a limp and flapping arm as he ran. They saw the\nSergeant and ran to him.\n\n\"Hell, Sarge, I thought y'were blown to little egg-shells.\"\n\n\"I ain't,\" said Sergeant Walpole. He looked again at the hole in the\nground and swore painedly.\n\n\"Look at that,\" said the man with the flapping arm. \"Hell's goin' to pop\naround here, Sarge.\"\n\nThe sergeant swung around. Then his mouth dropped open. Just half a mile\naway and hardly more than two hundred yards from the shore-line, the\nDiesel tramp was ramming the beach. A wake still foamed behind it. A\nmonstrous bow-wave spread out on either hand, over-topping even the\ncombers that came rolling in. It was being deliberately run ashore. It\nstruck, and its fore-mast crumpled up and fell forward, carrying its\nderrick-booms with it. There was the squeal of crumpled metal plates.\n\n\"Flyin' a yeller flag just now,\" panted one of the two privates. \"We\nstarted poppin' hexynitrate bullets at her an' she flung a shell at us.\nShe's a enemy ship. But what the hell?\"\n\nSmoke spurted up from the beached ship. Her stern broke off and settled\nin the deeper water out from the shore. More smoke spurted out. Her bow\nsplit wide. There were the deep rumbles of black-powder explosions.\nSergeant Walpole and his two followers stared blankly. More explosions,\nand the ship was hidden in smoke, and when it blew away her funnel was\ndown and half or more of her upper works was sliding into the sea, and\nshe had listed suddenly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSergeant Walpole gazed upward. Futilely, of course; there was nothing in\nsight overhead. But these explosions did look like the hexynitrate stuff\nthey put in small-arm bullets nowadays. A thirty-caliber bullet had the\nexplosive effect of an old-style six-pound T.N.T. shell. Only,\nhexynitrate goes off with a crack instead of a boom. It wasn't an\nAmerican plane opening up with a machine-gun.\n\nThen the beached ship seemed to blow up. A mass of thick smoke covered\nher from stem to stern, and bits of plating flew heavily through the\nair, and there were a few lurid bursts of flame. Sergeant Walpole\nsuddenly remembered that there ought to be survivors, only he hadn't\nseen anybody diving overboard to try to get ashore. He half-started\nforward....\n\nThen the sea-breeze blew this smoke, too, away from the wreckage. And\nthe tramp was gone, but there was something else left in its place--so\nthat Sergeant Walpole took one look, and swallowed a non-existent\nsomething that came up instantly into his throat again, and remembered\nthe urgent thing he had to do.\n\n\"Pete,\" he said calmly, \"you hunt up the Area Officer an' tell him what\nyou seen. Here! I'll give you a report that'll keep 'em from slammin'\nyou in clink for bein' drunk. Grab a monocycle somewheres. It's faster\nthan a car, the way you'll be travelin'. First telephone you come to\nthat's workin', make Central put you in the tight beam to head-quarters.\nThen go on an' report, y'self. See?\"\n\nPete started, and automatically fumbled with his limp and useless arm.\nThen he carefully tucked the unmanageable hand in the pocket of his\nuniform blouse.\n\n\"That don't matter now,\" he said absurdly.\n\nHe was looking at the thing left in place of the tramp, as Sergeant\nWalpole scribbled on one of the regulation report-forms of the Eastern\nCoast Observation Force. And the thing he saw was enough to upset\nanybody.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhere the tramp had been there was a single bit of bow-plating sticking\nup out of the surf, and a bunch of miscellaneous floating wreckage\ndrifting sluggishly toward the beach. And there was a solid, rounded,\nmetallic shape apparently quite as long as the original tramp had been.\nThere was a huge armored tube across its upper part, with vision-slits\nin two bulbous sections at its end. There were gun-ports visible here\nand there, and already a monstrous protuberance was coming into view\nmidway along its back, as if forced into position from within. Where the\nbow of the tramp had been there were colossal treads now visible. There\nwas a sort of conning-tower, armored and grim. There was a ghastly\nsteel beak. The thing was a war-machine of monstrous size. It emitted a\nsudden roaring sound, as of internal-combustion engines operating at\nfull power, and lurched heavily. The steel plates of the tramp still\nvisible above water, crumpled up like paper and were trodden under. The\nthing came toward the shore. It slithered through the shallow sea, with\nwaves breaking against its bulging sides. It came out upon the beach,\nits wet sides glittering. It was two hundred feet long, and it looked\nsomehow like a gigantic centipede.\n\nIt was a tank, of sorts, but like no tank ever seen on earth before. It\nwas the great-grandfather of all tanks. It was so monstrous that for its\nconveyance a ship's hull and superstructure had been built about it, and\nits own engines had been the engines of that ship. It was so huge that\nit could only be landed by blasting away a beached ship from about\nitself, so it could run under its own power over the fragments to the\nshore.\n\nNow it stopped smoothly on the sandy beach, in which its eight-foot-wide\nsteel treads sank almost a yard. Men dropped down from ports in its\nswelling sides. They made swift, careful inspections of predetermined\npoints. They darted back up the ladders again. The thing roared once\nmore. Then it swung about, headed for the sand-dunes, and with an\nextraordinary smoothness and celerity disappeared inland.\n\n\n\n\nPART II\n\n    \"... The Wabbly was meant for one purpose, the\n    undermining of civilian morale. To accomplish that\n    purpose it set systematically about the establishment\n    of a reign of terror; and so complete was its success\n    that half the population of a state was in headlong\n    flight within two hours. It was, first, mysterious;\n    secondly, deadly, and within a very few hours it had\n    built up a reputation for invincibility. Judged on the\n    basis of its first twelve hours' work alone, it was the\n    most successful experiment of the war. Its effect on\n    civilian morale was incalculable.\" (_Strategic Lessons\n    of the War of 1941-43._--U. S. War College. Pp. 80-81.)\n\n\nTwo of the members of Observation-Post Fourteen gaped after the\nretreating monster. Sergeant Walpole scribbled on the official form.\nJust as the monstrous thing dipped down out of sight there was a\nvicious, crashing report from its hinder part. Something shrieked....\n\nSergeant Walpole got up, spitting sand. There was blood on the\nreport-form in his hand. He folded it painstakingly. Of the two men who\nhad been with him, one was struggling out of the sand as Sergeant\nWalpole had had to do. The other was scattered over a good many square\nyards of sandy beach.\n\n\"Um. They seen us,\" said Sergeant Walpole, \"an' they got Pete. You'll\nhave to take this report. I'm goin' after the damn thing.\"\n\n\"What for?\" asked the other man blankly.\n\n\"To keep it in sight,\" said Sergeant Walpole. \"That's tactics. If\nsomebody springs somethin' you ain't able to fight, run away but keep it\nin sight an' report to the nearest commissioned officer. Remember that.\nNow get on. There's monocycles in the village. Get there an' beat that\ndamn Wabbly thing with the news.\"\n\nHe saw his follower start off, sprinting. That particular soldier, by\nthe way, was identified by his dog-tag some days later. As nearly as\ncould be discovered, he had died of gas. But Sergeant Walpole picked up\none of the two rifles, blew sand out of the breech-mechanism, and\nstarted off after the metal monster. He walked in the eight-foot track\nof one of its treads. As he went, he continued the cleaning of sand from\nthe rifle in his hands. The rifle was useless against such a monster,\nof course, but it is quaint to reflect that in that automatic rifle,\nfiring hexynitrate bullets, each equivalent to a six-pounder T.N.T.\nshell in destructiveness, Sergeant Walpole carried greater \"fire-power\"\nthan Napoleon ever disposed in battle.\n\nThe tread of the Wabbly made a perfect roadway. Presently Sergeant\nWalpole looked up to find himself scrutinizing somebody's dining-room\ntable, set for lunch. The Wabbly had crossed a house in its path without\nswerving. Walls, chimneys, timbers and planks, all had gone beneath its\ntreads. But they had been pressed so smoothly flat that until Sergeant\nWalpole looked down at his footing, he would not have known he was\nwalking on the wreckage of a building.\n\nIt was half an hour before he reached the village. The Wabbly had gone\nfrom end to end, backed up, and gone over the rest of it again. There\nwas the taint of gas in the air. Sergeant Walpole halted outside the\ndebris. His gas-mask had been blown to atoms with Observation-Post\nFourteen.\n\n\"They're tryin' to beat the news o' their comin',\" he reflected aloud,\n\"which is why they smashed up the village. The telephone exchange was\nthere.... Tillie's under there somewheres....\"\n\nHe fumbled with the rifle, suddenly swearing queerly hate-distorted\noaths. Tillie had not been the great love of Sergeant Walpole's life.\nShe was merely a country telephone operator, reasonably pretty, and\nflattered by his uniform. But she was under a mass of splintered wood\nand crushed brick-work, killed while trying to connect with the tight\nbeam to Area Headquarters to report the monster rushing upon the\nvillage. That monster had destroyed the little settlement. There was\nnothing left at all but wreckage and the eight-foot tracks of monster\ntreads. Sometimes those tracks crossed each other. Between them wreckage\nsurvived to a height of as much as four feet, which was the clearance of\nthe Wabbly's body.\n\nSomething roared low overhead. Sergeant Walpole swore bitterly, looked\nupward, and waited to die. But the small plane was American, and old. It\nwas a training-plane, useless for front-line work. It dived to earth,\nthe pilot waved impatiently, and Walpole plunged to a place beside him.\nInstantly thereafter the plane took off.\n\n\"What was it?\" shouted the pilot, sliding off at panic-stricken speed\nacross the tree-tops. \"They heard the bombs go off all the way to\nPhilly. Sent me. What in hell was it?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA thin, high, wailing sound coming down as lightning might be imagined\nto descend.... The pilot dived madly and got behind a pine forest before\nthe explosion and the concussion that followed it. Sergeant Walpole saw\nthe pine-trees shiver. The sheer explosion-wave of that egg, if it hit\nan old ship like this in mid-air, would have stripped the fabric from\nits wings.\n\n\"Set me down,\" said Sergeant Walpole. \"They're watchin' us from aloft. I\nsent a man on a monocycle to report.\" But he told luridly of the thing\nthat had come ashore, and of its destructiveness. \"Now set me down.\nGimme a gas-mask an' clear out. You ain't got a burglar's chance of\ngettin' back.\"\n\nThe pilot set him down, and began ticking away on a code sender even as\nhe landed. Then he climbed swiftly away from the Sergeant, headed in a\nweaving, crazy line to westward. Then things screamed downward and the\nSergeant clapped hands over his ears once more. The ground quivered\nunderfoot, though the eggs landed a good three-quarters of a mile away.\nThe training-plane dropped like a plummet. The sharpness of a\nhexynitrate explosion carries its effect to quite incredible distances.\nThe fabric of its wings split to ribbons. The ship landed somewhere and\nsmoke rose from it.\n\n\"He shouldn't ha' gone up so high,\" said Sergeant Walpole.\n\nHe struck across country for the treads of the Wabbly once more. He saw\na school-house. The Wabbly had passed within a hundred yards of it. The\nschool-house seemed deserted. Then the Sergeant saw the hole in its\nroof. Then he caught the infinitely faint taint of gas.\n\n\"Mighty anxious,\" said Sergeant Walpole woodenly, \"not to let news get\nahead of 'em. Yeah.... If it busts on places without warnin', it'll have\nthat much easier work. I hope I'm in on the party when we get this damn\nthing.\"\n\nThere was no use in approaching the school-house, though he had a\ngas-mask now. Sergeant Walpole went on.\n\n\n\n\nPART III\n\n    \"... The Wabbly made no attempt to do purely military\n    damage. The Enemy command realized that the destruction\n    of civilian morale was even more important than the\n    destruction of munitions factories. In this, the Enemy\n    displayed the same acumen that makes the war a fruitful\n    subject of study to the strategic student.\" (_Strategic\n    Lessons of the War of 1941-43._--U. S. War College.\n    Pp. 81-82.)\n\n\nAt nightfall the monster swerved suddenly and moved with greater speed.\nIt showed no lights. It did not even make very much noise. Then the\nsecond flight of home-defense planes made their attack. Sergeant Walpole\nheard them droning overhead. He lit a fire instantly. A little\nhelicopter dropped from the blackness above him and he began to heap\ndirt desperately on the blaze.\n\n\"Who's there?\" demanded a voice.\n\n\"Sergeant Walpole, Post Fourteen, Eastern Coast Observation,\" said the\nSergeant in a military manner. \"Beg to report, sir, that the dinkus that\nbrought down the other ships is housed in that big bulge on top of the\nWabbly.\"\n\n\"Get in,\" said the voice.\n\nThe Sergeant obeyed. With a purring noise the helicopter shot upward.\nThen something went off in mid-sky, miles ahead, where a faint humming\nnoise had announced the flight of attack-planes. A lurid, crackling\ndetonation lit up the sky. One of the ships of the night-flying\nsquadron. From the helicopter they could see the rest of the flight\nlimned clearly in the flash of the explosion. Instantly thereafter there\nwas another such flash. Then another.\n\n\"Three,\" said the voice beside Sergeant Walpole. Another flash.\n\"Four....\" The invisible operator of the screw-lifted ship was very calm\nabout it. \"Five. Six.\" The explosions lit the sky. Presently he said\ngrimly. \"That's all of them. I'd better report it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was silent for a while. Sergeant Walpole saw his hand flicking a key\nup and down in the faint light of radio bulbs.\n\n\"Now shoot the works,\" said the helicopter man evenly. \"All the ships\nthat attacked this afternoon went down. One of them started to report,\nbut didn't get but two words through. What did that damned thing use on\nthem?\"\n\n\"A dinkus on top, sir,\" said Sergeant Walpole formally. \"I'd found a\nmonocycle, sir, and was trailing the thing. I'd come to the top of a\nhill and seen it moving through a pine-wood, crashing down the trees in\nfront of it like they wasn't there. Then a egg came down from\nGawd-knows-where up aloft. I stopped up my ears, thinkin' it was aimin'\nfor me. Then I seen the ships. Two of 'em were fallin'. They landed, an'\nI heard a coupla other explosions. Little ones, they sounded like.\"\n\nThe helicopter man's wrist was flicking up and down.\n\n\"Little ones!\" he said sardonically. \"Those ships were carrying\nfive-hundred-pound bombs! It was those you heard going off!\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" conceded Sergeant Walpole. \"There was twenty or thirty ships\nflyin' in formation, goin' hell-for-leather for the Wabbly. They were\ntrailin' it from the air. They were comin', natural, for me, because I\nwas between them an' it. Then my pants caught on fire--\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"My pants caught on fire,\" said Sergeant Walpole, woodenly. \"I was\nsittin' on the monocycle, tryin' to figure out which way to duck. An' my\npants caught on fire. The bike was gettin' hot. I climbed off it an' it\nblew up. My rifle was hot, too, an' I chucked it away. Then I saw a ship\ngo down, on fire. The Wabbly'd stopped still an' it didn't fire a shot.\nI'll swear to that. Just my monocycle got hot an' caught on fire, an'\nthen a ship busted out in flames an' went down. A couple more eggs come\ndown an' three ships dropped. Didn't hit 'em. The concussion blew the\nfabric off 'em. Another one caught fire an' crashed. Then another one. I\nlooked, an' saw the next one catch. Then the next. It was like a\nsearchlight beam hittin' 'em. They flamed up, blew up, an' that was\nthat. The last two tried to get away, but they lit up an' crashed.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe pilot's hand flicked up and down, interminably. There was the steady\nfierce down-beat of the slip-stream from the vertical propellers. The\nhelicopter swept forward in a swooping dash.\n\n\"The whole east coast's gone crazy,\" said the 'copter man drily. \"Crazy\nfools trying to run away. Roads jammed. Work stopped. It leaked out\nabout the planes being wiped out to-day, and everybody in three states\nhas heard those eggs going off. You're the only living man who's seen\nthat crawling thing and lived to tell about it. I've sent your stuff\nback. What's that about the thing on top?\"\n\n\"I hid,\" said Sergeant Walpole, woodenly. \"The Wabbly sent over\ngas-shells where the ships landed. Then it went on. Headin' west. It's\ngot a crazy-lookin' dinkus on top like a searchlight. That moved, while\nthe ships were catchin' fire an' crashin'. Just like a searchlight, it\nmoved an' the ships went down. But the Wabbly didn't fire a shot.\"\n\nThe helicopter man's wrist flexed swiftly....\n\n\"Gawd!\" said Sergeant Walpole in sudden agony. \"Drop! Quick!\"\n\nThe helicopter went down like a stone. A propeller shrieked away into\nspace. Metalwork up aloft glowed dully red. Then there were whipping,\nlashing branches closing swiftly all around the helicopter. A jerk. A\ncrash. Stillness. The smell of growing things all about.\n\n\"Well?\" said the 'copter pilot.\n\n\"They turned it on us--whatever it is,\" said Sergeant Walpole. \"They\nnear got us, too.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA match scratched. A cigarette glowed. The Sergeant fumbled for a smoke\nfor himself.\n\n\"I'm waiting for that metal to cool off,\" said the helicopter pilot.\n\"Maybe we can take off again. They located us with a loop while I was\nsending your stuff. Damn! I see what they've got!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"A way of transmitting real power in a radio beam,\" said the 'copter\nman. \"You've seen eddy-current stoves. Everybody cooks with 'em\nnowadays. A coil with a high-frequency current. You can stick your hand\nin it and nothing happens. But you stick an iron pan down in the coil\nand it gets hot and cooks things. Hysteresis. The same thing that used\nto make transformer-cores get hot. The same thing happens near any beam\ntransmitter, only you have to measure the heating effect with a\nthermo-couple. The iron absorbs the radio waves and gets hot. The chaps\nin the Wabbly can probably put ten thousand horsepower in a damned beam.\nWe can't. But any iron in the way will get hot. It blows up a ship at\nonce. Your monocycle and your rifle too. Damn!\"\n\nHe knocked the ash off his cigarette.\n\n\"Scientific, those chaps. I'll see if that metal's cool.\"\n\nSomething whined overhead, rising swiftly to a shriek as it descended.\nSergeant Walpole cowered, with his hands to his ears. But it was not an\nearth-shaking concussion. It was an explosion, yes, but subtly different\nfrom the rending snap of hexynitrate.\n\n\"Gas,\" said the Sergeant dully, and fumbled for his mask.\n\n\"No good,\" said the 'copter man briefly. \"Vesicatory. Smell it? I guess\nthey've got us. No sag-suits. Not even sag-paste.\"\n\nThe Sergeant lit a match. The flame bent a little from the vertical.\n\n\"There's a wind. We got a chance.\"\n\n\"Get going, then,\" said the 'copter man. \"Run upwind.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSergeant Walpole slid over the side and ran. A hundred yards. Two\nhundred. Pine-woods have little undergrowth. He heard the helicopter's\nengines start. The ship tried to lift. He redoubled his speed. Presently\nhe broke out into open ploughed land.\n\nIn the starlight he saw a barn, and he raced toward that. Someone else\nplunged out of the woods toward him. The helicopter-engine was still\nroaring faintly in the distance. Then a thin whine came down from\naloft....\n\nWhen the echoes of the explosion died away the pilot was grinning\nqueerly. The helicopter's engine was still.\n\n\"I said it could be done! Pack of fat-heads at Headquarters!\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"Picking up a ship by its spark-plugs, with a loop. They're doing that\nup aloft. There's a ship up there, forty thousand feet or so. Maybe half\na dozen ships. Refueling in air, I guess, and working with the thing you\ncall a Wabbly. When I started the 'copter's engine they got the\nspark-impulses and sighted on them. We'd better get away from here.\"\n\n\"Horses in here,\" said Sergeant Walpole. \"The Wabbly came by. No people\nleft.\"\n\nThey brought the animals out. The horses reared and plunged as there\nwere other infinitely sharp, deadly explosions of the eggs coming down\neight miles through darkness.\n\n\"Let's go. After the Wabbly?\" said the 'copter man.\n\n\"O' course,\" said Sergeant Walpole. \"Somebody's got to find out how to\nlick it.\"\n\nThey went clattering through darkness. It was extraordinary what\ndesolation, what utter lack of human life they moved through. They came\nto a town, and there was a taint of gas in the air. No lights burned in\nthat town. It was dead. The Wabbly had killed it.\n\n\n\n\nPART IV\n\n    \"... which panic was enhanced by the destruction of a\n    second flight of fighting planes. However, the\n    destruction of Bendsboro completed civilian\n    demoralization.... A newscasting company re-broadcast\n    a private television contact with the town at the\n    moment the Wabbly entered it. Practically all the\n    inhabitants of the Atlantic Coast heard and saw the\n    annihilation of the town--hearing the cries of '_Gas!_'\n    and the screams of the people, and hearing the\n    crashings as the Wabbly crushed its way inexorably\n    across the city, spreading terror everywhere....\n    Frenzied demands were made upon the Government for the\n    recall of troops from the front to offer battle to the\n    Wabbly.... It is considered that at that time the one\n    Wabbly had a military effect equal to at least half a\n    million men.\" (_Strategic Lessons of the War of\n    1941-43._--U. S. War College. Pp. 83-84.)\n\n\nThey did not enter the town. There was just enough of starlight to show\nthat the Wabbly had gone through it, and then crashed back and forth\nruthlessly. There was a great gash through the center of the buildings\nnearest the edge, and there were other gashes visible here and there.\nEverything was crushed down utterly flat in two eight-foot paths; and\nthere was a mass of crumbled debris four feet high at its highest in\nbetween the tread-marks.\n\nThey looked, silently, and went on. They reached a railroad track, the\nquadruple track of a branch-line from New York to Philadelphia. The\nWabbly was going along that right-of-way. There was no right-of-way left\nwhere it had been. Rails were crushed flat. Culverts were broken\nthrough. But the horses raced along the smoothed tread-trails. Once a\nbroken, twisted rail tore at Sergeant Walpole's sleeve. Somehow the last\ngreat plate of a tread had bent it upward. Presently they saw a mass of\nsomething dark off to the left. Flames were licking meditatively at one\nof the wrecked cars.\n\nThen they heard explosions far ahead. Flames lighted the sky.\n\n\"Our men in action!\" said Sergeant Walpole hungrily.\n\nHe flogged his mount mercilessly. Then the sky became bright in the\ndistance. The horses, going down the crushed-smooth trail of the treads,\ngained upon the din. Then they saw the cause of it, miles distant. A\ntrain was burning luridly. Its forepart was wreckage, pure and simple.\nThe rest was going up in flames and detonations. Munitions, of course.\nThe Wabbly was off at one side, flame-lit and monstrous, sliding\nsmoothly out of sight.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Ten miles of railroad,\" said the 'copter pilot calmly, \"mashed out of\nexistence. That's going to scare our people into fits. They can drop\neggs till the cows come home, and every egg'll smash up a hundred yards\nof right-of-way, and we can build it back up again in four hours with\nmobile track-layers. But ten miles to be regraded and laid is different.\nHalf of America will be imagining all our railroads smashed and\nstarvation ahead.\"\n\nA piercing light fell upon them.\n\n\"Shut it off!\" roared Sergeant Walpole. \"D'y'want to get us killed?\"\n\nHe and the 'copter pilot swerved. There was a car there, a huge\ntwo-wheeled car, whose gyroscopes hummed softly while its driver tried\nto extract it from something it was tangled in.\n\n\"I commandeer this car,\" said the 'copter pilot. \"Military necessity. We\nhave to trail that Wabbly.\"\n\nSomeone grunted. Lights flashed on within. The 'copter pilot and\nSergeant Walpole stiffened to attention. The stars of a major-general\nshone on the collar of the stout man within.\n\n\"Beg pardon, sir,\" said the pilot, and was still.\n\n\"Umph,\" said the major-general. \"There seem to be just four of us alive,\nwho've seen the thing clearly. I hit on it by accident, I'll admit. What\ndo you know about it?\"\n\n\"It come on a tramp-steamer--\" began Sergeant Walpole.\n\n\"Hm. You're Sergeant Walpole. Mentioned in dispatches to-morrow,\nSergeant. You, sir?\"\n\n\"Its weapon against our planes, sir,\" said the 'copter man precisely,\n\"is a radio beam carrying several thousand horsepower of energy. When it\nhits iron, sir, the energy is absorbed and the iron heats up and blows\nup the ship. The Wabbly's working with a bomber well aloft, sir, which\nspots planes from below by picking up their spark-plug flashes in a\ndirectional loop. The bomber aloft, sir, drops eggs when the Wabbly's\nattacked. Sergeant Walpole reports several planes disabled by their\nfabric being blown off their wings.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I know,\" said the major-general. \"Dammit, the front takes every ship\nthat's fit to go aloft. We have only wrecks back here. You're sure about\nthat spark-plug affair?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the 'copter pilot. \"My ship crashed, sir. I started the\nmotors again, trying to take off. Eggs began to drop about me\ninstantly.\"\n\n\"Nasty!\" said the major-general. \"I was going to join my men. We've\nflung a line of artillery ahead of the thing. Motor-driven, of course.\nBut if they can pick up motors by the spark-waves, the bomber knows all\nabout it. Nasty!\"\n\nHe lit a cigar, calmly. The gyrocar shifted suddenly and backed away\nfrom the thing it had been tangled in.\n\n\"Why ain't the bombers been shot down?\" demanded Sergeant Walpole\nangrily. \"Dammit, sir, if it wasn't for them bombers--\"\n\n\"Up to an hour ago,\" said the major-general, \"we had lost sixty-eight\nplanes trying to get those bombers. You see, it works both ways. The\nbombers drop eggs to help the Wabbly defend itself. And the Wabbly uses\nthat power-beam you spoke of to wipe the sky clean about the bombers. I\nwondered how it was done, before you explained, sir. Do you men want to\ncome with me? Get on the running-board if you like. We shall probably be\nkilled.\"\n\nThe gyrocar purred softly away, with two horses left wandering and two\nmen clinging fast in a sweep of wind. They found a ribbon of concrete\nroad and the wind sang as the car picked up speed. Then, suddenly, it\nbucked madly and went out of control, and, as suddenly, was passing\nalong the road again. The Wabbly had passed over the roadway here.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd then they heard gunfire ahead. Honest, malevolent gunfire. Flashes\nlit the horizon. The gyrocar speeded up until it fairly hummed, and the\nwind rushed into the nostrils and mouths of the men on the\nrunning-boards. The cannonade increased. It reached really respectable\nproportions, until it became a titanic din. As the road rose up a long\nincline, a shell burst in mid-air in plain view, and the driver of the\ngyrocar jammed on the brakes and looked down upon the strangest of\nsights below.\n\nThere were other hills yet ahead, and from behind them came that faint,\nindefinite glow which is the glow of the lights of a city. At the bottom\nof a valley, a mile and a half distant, there was the Wabbly.\nStar-shells flared near it, casting it into intolerable brightness and\nclear relief. And other shells were breaking upon it and all about it.\nFrom beyond the rim of hills came the flashes of guns. The air was full\nof screamings and many crashes.\n\nThe Wabbly was motionless. It looked more than ever like a monstrous,\ndeadly centipede. It was under a rain of fire that would have shattered\na dreadnaught of the 1920's. Its monstrous treads were motionless. It\nseemed queerly quiescent, abstracted; it seemed less defiant of the\nshell-fire that broke upon it like the hail of hell, than indifferent to\nit. Yes, it seemed indifferent!\n\nOnly the queer excrescence on its top moved, and that stirred vaguely.\nStar-shells floated overhead and bathed it in pitiless light. And it\nremained motionless.... Sergeant Walpole had a vague impression of\ncolossal detonations taking place miles above his head, but the sound\nwas lost in the drumfire of artillery nearer at hand.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen a gun on the Wabbly moved. It spouted a flash of bluish flame, and\nthen another and another. It seemed to fire gas-shells into the town, at\nthis moment, ignoring the batteries playing upon it. It was still again,\nwhile the queer excrescence on its back moved vaguely and shells burst\nabout it in a very inferno.\n\nThen the treads moved, and with a swift celerity the Wabbly moved\nsmoothly forward and up the incline toward the cannonading guns. It went\nover the top of the incline, and those in the gyrocar saw its reception.\nGuns opened on it at point-blank range. Now the Wabbly itself went into\naction. In the light of star-shells and explosions they saw its guns\nbegin to bellow. It went swiftly and malevolently forward, moving with\ncentipedean smoothness.\n\nIt dipped out of sight. The cannonade lessened. Two guns stopped.\nThree.... Half a dozen guns were out of action. A dozen guns ceased to\nfire.... One last weapon boomed desperately at its maximum rate of\nfire....\n\nThat stopped. The night became strangely, terribly still. The\nmajor-general put aside his radivision receiver. Though neither the\nhelicopter pilot nor Sergeant Walpole had noticed it, he had opened\ncommunication the instant the gyrocar came to a stop. Now the\nmajor-general was desperately, terribly white.\n\n\"The artillery is wiped out,\" he observed detachedly. \"The Wabbly, it\nseems, is going on into the town.\"\n\nThey did not want to listen, those men who waited futilely by the\ngyrocar which had witnessed the invulnerability of the Wabbly to all\nattack. They did not want to listen at all. But they heard the noises as\nthe Wabbly crashed across the town, and back and forth.\n\n\"Morale effect,\" said the major-general, through stiff lips. \"That's\nwhat it's for. To break down the morale behind the lines. Good God! What\nhellish things mere words can mean!\"\n\n\n\n\nPART V\n\n    \"... The only weak spot in the Wabbly's design,\n    apparently, was the necessity of using its entire\n    engine-power in the power-beam with which it protected\n    itself and its attendant bombers from aerial attack.\n    For a time, before New Brunswick, it was forced to\n    remain still, under fire, while it fought off and\n    destroyed an attacking fleet eight miles above it. With\n    sufficiently powerful artillery, it might have been\n    destroyed at that moment. But it was invulnerable to\n    the artillery available.... Deliberately false\n    statements were broadcast to reassure the public, but\n    the public was already skeptical, as it later became\n    incredulous, of official reports of victories. The\n    destruction of New Brunswick became known despite\n    official denials, and colossal riots broke out among\n    the inhabitants of the larger cities, intent upon\n    escape from defenseless towns.... Orders were actually\n    issued withdrawing a quarter of a million men from the\n    front-line reserve, with artillery in proportion to\n    their force.\" (_Strategic Lessons of the War of\n    1941-43._--U. S. War College. P. 92.)\n\n\nThe major-general left them at the town, now quite still and silent.\nSergeant Walpole said detachedly:\n\n\"We'll prob'ly find a portable sender, sir, an' trail the Wabbly. That's\nabout all we can do, sir.\"\n\n\"It looks,\" said the major-general rather desperately, \"as if that is\nall anybody can do. I'm going on to take command ahead.\"\n\nThe 'copter pilot said politely:\n\n\"Sir, if you're going to sow mines for the Wabbly--\"\n\n\"Of course!\"\n\n\"That power-beam can explode them, sir, before the Wabbly gets to them.\nMay I suggest, sir, that mine-cases with no metal in them at all would\nbe worth trying?\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the major-general grimly. \"I'll have concrete ones\nmade.\"\n\nSergeant Walpole grunted suddenly.\n\n\"Look here, sir! The Wabbly stops when it uses that dinkus on top. This\nguy here says it uses a lotta power--four or five thousan' horsepower.\"\n\n\"More likely ten or twenty,\" said the 'copter pilot.\n\n\"Maybe,\" said Sergeant Walpole profoundly, \"it takes all the power they\ngot to work that dinkus. They were workin' it just now when the\nartillery was slammin' 'em. So next time you want to tackle it, stick a\nflock o' bombs around an' attack the bombers too. If they're kept busy\ndown below, maybe the planes can get the bombers, or otherwise they'll\nget a chance to use a big gun on the Wabbly.\"\n\nThe major-general nodded.\n\n\"We four,\" he observed, \"are the only living men who've actually seen\nthe Wabbly and gotten away. I shall use both your suggestions. And I\nshall not send those orders by radio--not even tight beam radio. I'll\ncarry them myself. Good luck!\"\n\nA non-commissioned officer of the Eastern Coast Observation Force and a\nyet uncommissioned flying cadet waved a cheerful good-by to the\nmajor-general in charge of home defense in three states. Then they went\non into the town.\n\n\"Monocycles first,\" said Sergeant Walpole. \"An' a sender.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe 'copter man nodded. The street-lights of the town dimmed and\nbrightened. The Wabbly had paused only to create havoc, not to produce\nutter chaos. It had gone back and forth over the town two or three\ntimes, spewing out gas as it went. But most of the town was still\nstanding, and the power-house had not been touched. Only its untended\nDiesels had checked before a fuel-pump cleared.\n\nThey found a cycle-shop, its back wall bulged in by wreckage against it.\nSergeant Walpole inspected its wares expertly. A voice began to speak\nsuddenly. A television set had somehow been turned on by the crash that\nbulged the back wall.\n\n\"The monster tank has been held in check,\" said a smug voice\nencouragingly. \"Encountered by home-defense troops and artillery, it\nproved unable to face shell-fire....\"\n\n\"Liars!\" said the 'copter man calmly. He picked up the nearest loose\nobject and flung it into the bland face of the official news-announcer.\nThe television set went dead, but there were hissings and sputterings in\nits interior. He had flung a Bissel battery at it, one of a\ndisplay-group, and its high-tension terminals hissed and sparked among\nthe stray wires in the cabinet.\n\n\"That makes me mad,\" said the 'copter man grimly. \"Lying for morale! The\nother side murders our civilians to break down morale, and our side lies\nabout it to build morale back up again. To hell with morale!\"\n\nSergeant Walpole reached in and pulled out the battery. Bissel batteries\nturn out six hundred volts these days, and they make a fat spark when\nshort-circuited.\n\n\"For Gawd's sake!\" said Sergeant Walpole. \"If they can pick up sparks\nfrom a motor, can't they pick 'em up from this? What the hell y'doin'?\nY'want 'em droppin' eggs on us? Say!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe stopped short, his eyes burning. He began to talk, suddenly groping\nfor words while he waved the high-powered small battery in his hand. The\nhelicopter man listened, at first skeptically and then with an equally\nhungry enthusiasm.\n\n\"Sergeant,\" he said evenly, \"that's an idea! A whale of an idea! A hell\nof a fine idea! Let's get some rockets!\"\n\n\"Why rockets?\" demanded Sergeant Walpole in his turn. \"Whatcha want to\ndo? Celebrate the Fourth o' July?\"\n\nThe 'copter man explained, this time, and Sergeant Walpole seized upon\nthe addition. Then they began a hunt. They roved the town over, and it\nwas not pleasant. When the Wabbly had gone into that town there had\nstill been very many living human beings in it. Some of them had\nbelieved in the ability of the artillery to defend the town against a\nsingle monster. Some had had no means of getting away. But all of them\nhad tried to get away when the Wabbly went lurching in among the houses.\n\nFor them, the Wabbly had spewed out deadly gases. Also it had simply\nforged ahead. And the two living men in their gas-masks paid as little\nattention as possible to the bodies in the streets, most of them in\nflimsy night-clothing, struck down in frenzied flight, but they could\nnot help seeing too much....\n\nIn the end they went back to the artillery-positions and found\nsignal-rockets there. Two full cases of them, marvelously unexploded. A\nlittle later two monocycles purred madly in the beaten-down paths of the\nmonstrous treads. Sergeant Walpole bore very many Bissel batteries,\nwhich will deliver six hundred volts even on short-circuit for half an\nhour at a time. The 'copter man carried some of them, too, and both men\nwere loaded down.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen dawn came they were hollow-eyed and gaunt and weary. It had started\nto rain, too, and both of them were drenched. They could see no more\nthan a couple of hundred yards in every direction, and they were hungry,\nand they had seen things no man should have to look upon, in the way of\ndestruction. They came upon a wrecked artillery-train just as the world\nlightened to a pallid gray. Guns twisted and burst. Caissons, no more\nthan shattered scraps of metal, because of the explosion of the shells\nwithin them. And the tread-tracks of the Wabbly led across the mess.\nSteam still rose, hissing softly, from the bent and twisted guns which\nhad burst when they were heated to redness by the power-beam. And there\nwas a staff gyrocar crumpled against a tree where it had been flung by\nsome explosion or other. There were neither sound nor wounded men about;\nonly dead ones. The Wabbly had been here.\n\n\"Hullo,\" said the helicopter man in a dreary levity, \"there's a portable\nvision set in this car. Let's call up the general and see how he is?\"\n\nSergeant Walpole spat. Then he held up his hand. He was listening. Far\noff in the drumming downpour of the rain there was a rumbling sound. He\nhad heard it before. It was partly made up of the noise of\ninternal-combustion engines of unthinkable power, and partly of\ngrumbling treads forcing a way through reluctant trees. It was a long\nway off, now, but it was coming nearer.\n\n\"The Wabbly,\" said Sergeant Walpole. \"Comin' back. Why? Hell's bells!\nWhy's it comin' back?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said the 'copter man, \"but let's get some rockets fixed\nup.\"\n\nThe two of them worked almost lackadaisically. They were tired out. But\nthey took the tiny Bissel batteries and twisted the attached wires\nabout the rocket-heads. They had twenty or thirty of them fixed by the\ntime the noise of the Wabbly was very near. There was the noise of\nfelled trees, pushed down by the Wabbly in its progress. Great,\ncrackling crashes, and then crunching sounds, and above them the\nthunderous smooth purring rumble of the monster. The 'copter man climbed\ninto the upside-down staff car. He turned the vision set on and fiddled\nabsurdly with the controls.\n\n\"I'm getting something,\" he announced suddenly. \"The bomber up aloft is\nsending its stuff down a beam, a tight beam to the Wabbly. Listen to\nit!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe uncouth, clacking syllables of the enemy tongue came from the vision\nset. Someone was speaking crisply and precisely somewhere. Blurred,\nindistinct flashes appeared on the vision set screen.\n\n\"They ought to be worried,\" the 'copter man said wearily. \"Even an\ninfra-red telescope can't pick up a damned thing through clouds like\nthis. And the Wabbly's in a mess without a bomber to help....\"\n\nSergeant Walpole did not reply. He was exhausted. He sat looking tiredly\noff through the rain in the direction of the approaching noise. Somehow\nit did not occur to him to run away. He sat quite still, smoking a soggy\ncigarette.\n\nSomething beaked and huge appeared behind a monstrous oak-tree. It came\non. The oak-tree crackled, crashed, and went down. It was ground under\nby the monstrous war-engine that went over it. The Wabbly was\nunbelievably impersonal and horrible in its progress. There had been a\nfilling-station for gyrocars close by the place where the\nartillery-train had been wrecked. One of the eight-foot treads loomed\nover that station, descended upon it--and the filling-station was no\nmore. The Wabbly was then not more than a hundred yards from Sergeant\nWalpole, less than a city block. He looked at it in a weary detachment.\nIt was as high as a four-story house, and it was two hundred feet long,\nand forty feet wide at the treads with the monstrous gun-bulges reaching\nout an extra ten or fifteen feet on either side above. And it came\ngrumbling on toward him.\n\n\n\n\nPART VI\n\n    \"... Considered as a strategic move, the Wabbly was a\n    triumph. Eighteen hours after its landing, the orders\n    for troops called for half a million men to be\n    withdrawn from the forces at the front and in reserve,\n    and munitions-factories were being diverted from the\n    supply of the front to the manufacture of devices\n    designed to cope with it. This, in turn, entailed\n    changes in the front-line activities of the Command....\n    Altogether, it may be said that the Wabbly, eighteen\n    hours after its landing, was exerting the military\n    pressure of an army of not less than half a million men\n    upon the most vulnerable spot in our defenses--the\n    rear.... And when its effect upon civilian morale is\n    considered, the Wabbly, as a force in being,\n    constituted the most formidable military unit in\n    history.\" (_Strategic Lessons of the War of\n    1941-43._--U. S. War College. P. 93.)\n\n\nAs Sergeant Walpole saw the Wabbly, there was no sign of humanity\nanywhere about the thing. It was a monstrous mass of metal,\npowder-stained now where shells had burst against it, and it seemed\nmetallically alive, impersonally living. The armored tube with\nvision-slits at its ends must have been the counterpart of a ship's\nbridge, but it looked like the eye-ridge of an insect's face. The\nbulbous control-rooms at the ends looked like a gigantic insect's\nmulti-faceted eyes. And the huge treads, so thick as to constitute armor\nfor their own protection, were so cunningly joined and sprung that they,\ntoo, seemed like part of a living thing.\n\nIt came within twenty yards of the staff-car with the 'copter man in it\nand Sergeant Walpole smoking outside. It ignored them. It had destroyed\nall life at this place. And Sergeant Walpole alone was visible, and he\nsat motionless and detached, unemotionally waiting to be killed. The\nWabbly clanked and rumbled and roared obliviously past them. Sergeant\nWalpole saw the flexing springs in the tread-joints, and there were\nhundreds of them, of a size to support a freight-car. He saw a\nrefuse-tube casually ejecting a gush of malodorous stuff, in which the\ngarbage of a mess-table was plainly identifiable. A drop or two of the\nstuff splashed on him, and he smelled coffee.\n\nAnd then the treads lifted, and he saw the monstrous gas-spreading tubes\nat the stern, and the exhaust-pipes into which he could have ridden,\nmonocycle and all. Then he saw a man in the Wabbly. There were\nventilation-ports open at the pointed stern and a man was looking out,\nsome fifteen feet above the ground, smoking placidly and looking out at\nthe terrain the Wabbly left behind it. He was wearing an enemy uniform\ncap.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe monster went on. The roar of its passing diminished a little. And\nthe 'copter man came suddenly out of the staff-car, struggling with the\nportable vision set.\n\n\"I think we can do it,\" he said shortly. \"It's in constant beam\ncommunication with a bomber up aloft, and I think they're worried up\nthere because they can't see a damned thing. But it's a good team. With\nthe Wabbly's beam, which takes so much power no bomber could possibly\ncarry it, the bombers are safe, and the bombers can locate any\nmotor-driven thing that might attack the Wabbly and blow it to hell. But\nright now they can't see it. So I think we can do it. Coming?\"\n\nSergeant Walpole threw away his cigarette and rose stiffly. Even those\nfew moments of rest had intensified his weariness. He flung a leg over\nthe monocycle's seat and pointed tiredly to the trail of the Wabbly. It\nnearly paralleled, here, a ribbon of concrete road which once had been a\nreasonably important feeder-highway.\n\n\"Let's go.\"\n\nThey went off through the rain along the road, nearly parallel to the\nroute the Wabbly was taking. Rain beat at them. Off in the woods to\ntheir right the Wabbly's noise grew louder as they overtook it. They\npassed it, and came abruptly out of the wooded area upon cultivated\nfields, rolling and beautifully cared-for. There had been a\nfarm-headquarters off to one side, a huge central-station for all the\nagricultural work on what once would have been half a county, but there\nwere jagged walls where buildings had been, and smoke still rose from\nthe place.\n\nThen the Wabbly came out of the woods, a dim gray monstrous shape in the\nrain.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe helicopter man pulled the ignition-cord and a rocket began to\nsputter. He made a single wipe with his knife-blade along the twisted\ninsulated wires of the Bissel battery, and a wavering blue spark leaped\ninto being. The rocket shot upward, curved down, and landed with enough\nforce to bury its head in the muddy ploughed earth and conceal the\nsignal-flare that must have ignited.\n\n\"That ought to do it,\" said the 'copter man. \"Let's send some more.\"\n\nSergeant Walpole got exhaustedly off his monocycle and duplicated the\n'copter man's efforts. A second rocket, a third.... A dozen or more\nrockets went off, each one bearing a wavering, uncertain blue spark at\nits tip. And that spark would continue for half an hour or more. In a\nloop aerial, eight miles up, it might sound like a spark-plug, or it\nmight sound like something else. But it would not sound like the sort of\nthing that ought to spring up suddenly in front of the Wabbly, and it\nwould sound like something that had better be bombed, for safety's sake.\n\nThe Wabbly was moving across the ploughed fields with a deceptive\nsmoothness. It was drawing nearer and nearer to the spot where the\nrockets had plunged to earth.\n\nIt stopped.\n\nAnother rocket left the weary pair of men, its nearly flashless exhaust\ninvisible in the daytime, anyway. The Wabbly backed slowly from the\nirregular line where the first rockets sparked invisibly. It was no more\nthan a distinct gray shadow in the falling rain, but the queer bulk atop\nits body moved suddenly. Like a searchlight, the power-beam swept the\nearth before the Wabbly. But nothing happened.\n\nThe 'copter man turned on the vision set he had packed from the staff\ngyrocar. Voices, crisp and anxious, came out of it. He caressed the set\naffectionately.\n\n\"Listen to 'em, Sergeant,\" he said hungrily. \"They're worried!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe voice changed suddenly. There was a sudden musical buzzing in the\nset, as of two dozen spitting sparks, in as many tones, all going at\nonce.\n\n\"Letting the guys in the Wabbly hear what they hear,\" said the 'copter\nman grimly. \"If God's good to us, now....\"\n\nThe voices changed again. They stopped.\n\nThe Wabbly itself was still, halted in its passage across a clear and\nrain-swept field by little sparking sounds which seemed to indicate the\npresence of something that had better be bombed for safety's sake.\n\nA thin whining noise came down from aloft. It rose to a piercing shriek,\nand there was a gigantic crater a half mile from the Wabbly, from which\nsmoke rose lazily. The Wabbly remained motionless. Another whining noise\nwhich turned to a shriek.... The explosion was terrific. It was a bit\nnearer the Wabbly.\n\n\"We'll send 'em some more rockets,\" said the 'copter man.\n\nThey went hissing invisibly through the rain. The Wabbly backed\ncautiously away from the spot where they landed, because they were\nwholly invisible and they made a sound which those in the Wabbly could\nnot understand. Always, to a savage, the unexplained is dangerous.\nModern warfare has reached the same high peak of wisdom. The Wabbly drew\noff from the sparks because it could not know what made them, and\nbecause it had used its power-beam and the bomber had dropped its bombs\nwithout stopping or destroying them. It was not conceivable to anybody\non either the Wabbly or the bombers aloft that inexplicable things could\nbe especially contrived to confront the Wabbly, unless they were\ncontrived to destroy it.\n\n\"They don't know what in hell they're up against,\" said the 'copter man\njoyously. \"Now lets give 'em fits!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRockets went off in swift succession. To the blinded men in the bomber\nabove the clouds it seemed that unexplained mechanisms were springing\ninto action by dozens, all about the Wabbly. They were mechanisms. They\nwere electric mechanisms. They were obviously designed to have some\neffect on the Wabbly. And the Wabbly had no defense against the\nunguessed-at effects of unknown weapons except....\n\nBombs began to rain from the sky. The Wabbly crawled toward the last gap\nleft in the ring of mysterious mechanisms. That closed. Triumphant,\nsinging sparks sang viciously in the amplifiers. Nothing was visible.\nNothing! Perhaps that was what precipitated panic. The bombers rained\ndown their deadly missiles. And somebody forgot the exact length of time\nit takes a bomb to drop eight miles....\n\nSergeant Walpole and the 'copter man were flat on the ground with their\nhands to their ears. The ground bucked and smote them. The unthinkable\nviolence of the hexynitrate explosions tore at their nerves, even at\ntheir sanity. And then there was an explosion with a subtle difference\nin its sound. Sergeant Walpole looked up, his head throbbing, his eyes\nwatering, dizzy and dazed, and bleeding at the nose and ears.\n\nThen he bumped into the 'copter man, shuddering on the ground. He did it\ndeliberately. There was a last crashing sound, and some of the blasted\nearth spattered on them. But then the 'copter man looked where Sergeant\nWalpole pointed dizzily.\n\nThe Wabbly was careened crazily on one side. One of its treads was\nuncoiling slowly from its frame. Its stern was blown in. Someone had\nforgotten how long it takes a bomb to drop eight miles, and the Wabbly\nhad crawled under one. More, from the racked-open stern of the Wabbly\nthere was coming a roaring, spitting cloud of gas. The Wabbly's\nstorage-tanks of gas had been set off. Inside, it would be a shambles.\nIts crew would be dead, killed by the gas the Wabbly itself had\nbroadcast in its wake....\n\n\n\n\nPART VII\n\n    \"... It is a point worth noticing, by any student of\n    strategy, that while the Wabbly in working solely for\n    effectiveness in lowering civilian morale worked upon\n    sound principles, yet the destruction of the Wabbly by\n    Sergeant Walpole and Flight Cadet Ryerson immediately\n    repaired all the damage done. Had it worked toward more\n    direct military aims, its work would have survived it.\n    It remains a pretty question for the student, whether\n    the Enemy Command, with the information it possessed,\n    made the soundest strategic use of its unparalleled\n    weapon.... But on the whole, the raid of the Wabbly\n    remains the most startling single strategic operation\n    of the war, if only because of its tremendous effect\n    upon civilian morale....\" (_Strategic Lessons of the\n    War of 1941-43._--U. S. War College. Pp. 94-96.)\n\n\nA major-general climbed out of a staff gyrocar and waded through mud for\nhalf a mile, after which he, in person, waked two sleeping men. They\nwere sprawled out in the puddle of rain which had gathered in a\ntorn-away tread from the Wabbly. They waked with extreme reluctance, and\nthen yawned even in the act of saluting in a military manner.\n\n\"Yes, sir;\" said Sergeant Walpole, yawning again. \"Yes, sir; the\nbombers've gone. We heard 'em tryin' to raise the Wabbly for about half\nan hour after she'd blown up. Then they cut off. I think they went home,\nsir. Most likely, sir, they think we used some new dinkus on the Wabbly.\nIt ain't likely they'll realize they blew it up themselves for us.\"\n\nThe major-general gave crisp orders. Men began to explore the Wabbly,\ncautiously. He turned back to the two sleepy and disreputable men who\nhad caused its destruction. His aspect was one of perplexity and\nadmiration.\n\n\"What did you men do?\" he demanded warmly. \"What in hell did you do?\"\n\nSergeant Walpole grinned tiredly. The 'copter man spoke for him.\n\n\"I think, sir,\" said the helicopter man, \"that we affected the morale of\nthe Wabbly's and the bombers' crews.\"\n\n\n\n\n+-----------------------------------------------------------+\n|Transcriber's Note:                                        |\n|                                                           |\n|The following words have been changed in the above text.   |\n|                                                           |\n|Page 404 closed                                            |\n|Diesel tramp edged closer inshore                          |\n|                                                           |\n|Page 405 though                                            |\n|\"Hell, Sarge, I thought y'were blown to little egg-shells. |\n|                                                           |\n|Page 414 Moral                                             |\n|Morale effect,\" said the major-general                     |\n|                                                           |\n|Page 417 Pp. 93 (Normalized to match other epigram styles.)|\n|War College.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
