The obvious question is: How much is nothing?]\n\n\nI still feel that the ingratiating little runts never _intended_ any\nharm. They were eager to please, a cinch to transact business with, and\nconstantly, everlastingly grateful to us for giving them asylum.\n\nYes, we gave the genuflecting little devils asylum. And we were glad to\nhave them around at first--especially when they presented our women with\na gift to surpass all gifts: a custom-built domestic servant.\n\nIn a civilization that had made such a fetish of personal liberty and\ndignity, you couldn't hire a butler or an upstairs maid for less than\nlove _and_ money. And since love was pretty much rationed along the\nlines of monogamy, domestic service was almost a dead occupation. That\nis, until the Ollies came to our planet to stay.\n\nEventually I learned to despise the spineless little immigrants from\nSirius, but the first time I met one he made me feel foolishly\nimportant. I looked at his frail, olive-skinned little form, and\nthought, _If this is what space has to offer in the way of advanced\nlife-forms ... well, we haven't done so badly on old Mother Earth_.\n\nThis one's name was Johnson. All of them, the whole fifty-six, took the\ncommonest Earth family names they could find, and dropped their own\nname-designations whose slobbering sibilance made them difficult for us\nto pronounce and write. It seemed strange, their casually wiping out\ntheir nominal heritage just for the sake of our convenience--imagine an\nO'Toole or a Rockefeller or an Adams arriving on Sirius IV and no sooner\nlearning the local lingo than insisting on becoming known as\nSslyslasciff-soszl!\n\nBut that was the Ollie. Anything to get along and please us. And of\ncourse, addressing them as Johnson, Smith, Jones, etc., did work\nsomething of a semantic protective coloration and reduce some of the\nbarriers to quick adjustment to the aliens.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n[Illustration]\n\nJohnson--_Ollie_ Johnson--appeared at my third under-level office a few\nmonths after the big news of their shipwreck landing off the Maine\ncoast. He arrived a full fifteen minutes ahead of his appointment, and I\nwas too curious to stand on the dignity of office routine and make him\nwait.\n\nAs he stood in the doorway of my office, my first visual impression was\nof an emaciated adolescent, seasick green, prematurely balding.\n\nHe bowed, and bowed again, and spent thirty seconds reminding me that it\nwas _he_ who had sought the interview, and it was _he_ who had the big\nfavors to ask--and it was wonderful, gracious, generous _I_ who flavored\nthe room with the essence of mystery, importance, godliness and\noverpowering sweetness upon whose fragrance little Ollie Johnson had\ncome to feast his undeserving senses.\n\n\"Sit down, sit down,\" I told him when I had soaked in all the celestial\nflattery I could hold. \"I love you to pieces, too, but I'm curious about\nthis proposition you mentioned in your message.\"\n\nHe eased into the chair as if it were much too good for him. He was\nstrictly humanoid. His four-and-a-half-foot body was dressed in the most\nconservative Earth clothing, quiet colors and cheap quality.\n\nWhile he swallowed slowly a dozen times, getting ready to outrage my\nillustrious being with his sordid business proposition, his coloring\nvaried from a rather insipid gray-green to a rich olive--which is why\nthe press instantly had dubbed them _Ollies_. When they got excited and\nblushed, they came close to the color of a ripe olive; and this was\noften.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOllie Johnson hissed a few times, his equivalent of throat-clearing, and\nthen lunged into his subject at a 90 degree tangent:\n\n\"Can it be that your gracious agreement to this interview connotes a\nwillingness to traffic with us of the inferior ones?\" His voice was\nlight, almost reedy.\n\n\"If it's legal and there's a buck in it, can't see any reason why not,\"\nI told him.\n\n\"You manufacture and distribute devices, I am told. Wonderful\nlabor-saving mechanisms that make life on Earth a constant pleasure.\"\n\nI was almost tempted to hire him for my public relations staff.\n\n\"We do,\" I admitted. \"Servo-mechanisms, appliances and gadgets of many\nkinds for the home, office and industry.\"\n\n\"It is to our everlasting disgrace,\" he said with humility, \"that we\nwere unable to salvage the means to give your magnificent civilization\nthe worthy gift of our space drive. Had Flussissc or Shascinssith\nsurvived our long journey, it would be possible, but--\" He bowed his\nhead, as if waiting for my wrath at the stale news that the only two\npower-mechanic scientists on board were D.O.A.\n\n\"That was tough,\" I said. \"But what's on your mind now?\"\n\nHe raised his moist eyes, grateful at my forgiveness. \"We who survived\ndo possess a skill that might help repay the debt which we have incurred\nin intruding upon your glorious planet.\"\n\nHe begged my permission to show me something in the outer waiting room.\nWith more than casual interest, I assented.\n\nHe moved obsequiously to the door, opened it and spoke to someone beyond\nmy range of vision. His words sounded like a repetition of\n\"_sissle-flissle_.\" Then he stepped aside, fastened his little wet eyes\non me expectantly, and waited.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nSuddenly the doorway was filled, jamb to jamb, floor to arch, with a\nhulking, bald-headed character with rugged pink features, a broad nose\nlike a pug, and huge sugar-scoops for ears. He wore a quiet business\nsuit of fine quality, obviously tailored to his six-and-a-half-foot,\ncliff-like physique. In spite of his bulk, he moved across the carpet to\nmy desk on cat feet, and came to a halt with pneumatic smoothness.\n\n\"I am a Soth,\" he said in a low, creamy voice. It was so resonant that\nit seemed to come from the walls around us. \"I have learned your\nlanguage and your ways. I can follow instructions, solve simple problems\nand do your work. I am very strong. I can serve you well.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe recitation was an expressionless monotone that sounded almost\nhaughty compared to the self-effacing Ollie's piping whines. His face\nhad the dignity of a rock, and his eyes the quiet peace of a cool, deep\nmountain lake.\n\nThe Ollie came forward. \"We have been able to repair only one of the six\nSoths we had on the ship. They are more fragile than we humanoids.\"\n\n\"They don't look it,\" I said. \"And what do you mean by _you_ humanoids?\nWhat's he?\"\n\n\"You would call him--a robot, I believe.\"\n\nMy astonished reaction must have satisfied the Ollie, because he allowed\nhis eyes to leave me and seek the carpet again, where they evidently\nwere more comfortable.\n\n\"You mean you--you _make_ these people?\" I gasped.\n\nHe nodded. \"We can reproduce them, given materials and facilities. Of\ncourse, your own robots must be vastly superior--\" a hypocritical sop to\nmy vanity--\"but still we hope you may find a use for the Soths.\"\n\nI got up and walked around the big lunker, trying to look blas\u00e9. \"Well,\nyes,\" I lied. \"Our robots probably have considerably better intellectual\nabilities--our cybernetic units, that is. However, you do have something\nin form and mobility.\"\n\nThat was the understatement of my career.\n\nI finally pulled my face together, and said as casually as I could,\n\"Would you like to license us to manufacture these--Soths?\"\n\nThe Ollie fluttered his hands. \"But that would require our working and\nmingling with your personnel,\" he said. \"We wouldn't consider imposing\nin such a gross manner.\"\n\n\"No imposition at all,\" I assured him.\n\nBut he would have none of it: \"We have studied your economics and have\nfound that your firm is an outstanding leader in what you term\n'business.' You have a superb distribution organization. It is our\nintention to offer you the exclusive--\" he hesitated, then dragged the\nword from his amazing vocabulary--\"franchise for the sale of our Soths.\nIf you agree, we will not burden you with their manufacture. Our own\nlittle plant will produce and ship. You may then place them with your\ncustomers.\"\n\nI studied the magnificent piece of animated sculpturing, stunned at the\npossibilities. \"You say a Soth is strong. How strong?\"\n\nThe huge creature startled me by answering the question himself. He bent\nflowingly from the waist, gripped my massive steel desk by one of its\nthick, overlapping top edges, and raised it a few inches from the\nfloor--with the fingers of one hand. When he put it down, I stood up and\nhefted one edge myself. By throwing my back into it, I could just budge\none side of the clumsy thing--four hundred pounds if it was an ounce!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOllie Johnson modestly refrained from comment. He said, \"The Department\nof Commerce has been helpful. They have explained your medium of\nexchange, and have helped us with the prices of raw materials. It was\nthey who recommended your firm as a likely distributor.\"\n\n\"Have you figured how much one of these Soths should sell for?\"\n\n\"We think we can show a modest profit if we sell them to you for $1200,\"\nhe said. \"Perhaps we can bring down our costs, if you find a wide enough\ndemand for them.\"\n\nI had expected ten or twenty times that figure. I'm afraid I got a\nlittle eager. \"I--uh--shall we see if we can't just work out a little\ncontract right now? Save you another trip back this afternoon.\"\n\n\"If you will forgive our boorish presumption,\" Ollie said, fumbling\nself-consciously in his baggy clothing, \"I have already prepared such a\ndocument with the help of the Attorney General. A very kindly\ngentleman.\"\n\nIt was simple and concise. It allowed us to resell the Soths at a price\nof $2000, Fair Traded, giving us a gross margin of $800 to work with. He\nassured me that upkeep and repairs on the robot units were negligible,\nand we could extend a very generous warranty which the Ollies would make\ngood in the event of failure. He gave me a quick rundown on the care and\nfeeding of a Sirian Soth, and then jolted me with:\n\n\"There is just a single other favor I beg of you. Would you do my little\ncolony the exquisite honor of accepting this Soth as your personal\nservant, Mr. Collins?\"\n\n\"Servant?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe bobbed his head. \"Yes, sir. We have trained him in the rudiments of\nthe household duties and conventions of your culture. He learns rapidly\nand never forgets an instruction. Your wife would find Soth most useful,\nI am quite certain.\"\n\n\"A magnificent specimen like this doing _housework_?\" I marveled at the\nlittle creature's empty-headedness.\n\n\"Again I must beg your pardon, sir. I overlooked mentioning a suggestion\nby the Secretary of Labor that the Soths be sold only for use in\ndomestic service. It was also the consensus of the President's whole\ncabinet that the economy of any nation could not cope with the problem\nof unemployment were our Soths to be made available for all the types of\nwork for which they are fitted.\"\n\nMy dream of empire collapsed. The little green fellow was undoubtedly\ntelling the truth. The unions would strike any plant or facility in the\nworld where a Soth put foot on the job. It would ruin our retail\nconsumer business, too--Soths wouldn't consume automobiles, copters,\ntheater tickets and filets mignon.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Johnson,\" I sighed. \"I'll be happy to try out your Soth. We\nhave a place out in the country where he'll come in handy.\"\n\nThe Ollie duly expressed his ecstasy at my decision, and backed out of\nmy office waving his copy of the contract. I had assured him that our\nboard of directors would meet within a week and confirm my signature.\n\nI looked up at the hairless giant. As general director of the Home\nAppliance Division of Worldwide Machines, Incorporated, I had made a\ndeal, all right. The first interplanetary business deal in history.\n\nBut for some reason, I couldn't escape the feeling that I'd been had.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the limoucopter, they charged me double fare for Soth's\ntransportation to the private field where I kept my boat. As we left\nDetroit, I watched him stare down at the flattened skyline, but he did\nit with the unseeing expression of an old commuter.\n\nJack, my personal pilot, had eyed my passenger at the airport with some\nconcern and sullen muttering. Now he made much of trimming ship after\ntakeoff. The boat did seem logy with the unaccustomed ballast--it was a\nfour-passenger Arrow, built for speed, and Soth had to crouch and spread\nall over the two rear seats. But he did so without complaint or comment\nfor the half-hour hop up to our estate on my favorite Canadian lake.\n\nAs the four hundred miles unreeled below us, I wondered how Vicki would\nreact to Soth. I should have phoned her, but how do you describe a Soth\nto a semi-invalid whose principal excitement is restricted to\nbird-watching and repotting puny geraniums, and a rare sunfishing\nexpedition to the end of our floating pier?\n\nWell, it was Friday, and I would have the whole weekend to work the\nrobot into our routine. I had called my friend, Dr. Frederick Hilliard,\na retired industrial psychologist, and invited him to drop over tonight\nif he wanted an interesting surprise. He was our nearest neighbor and my\nmost frequent chess partner, who lived a secluded bachelor's life in a\ncomfortable cabin on the far shore of our lake.\n\nAs we came in for a water landing, I saw Fred's boat at our pier. Then I\ncould make out Fred, Vicki and Clumsy, our Irish setter, all waiting for\nme. I hoped Fred's presence would help simmer Vicki down a little.\n\nWe drifted in to the dock, and I turned to Soth and told him to help my\npilot unload the supplies. This pleased Jack, whose Pilot and\nChauffeur's Local frequently reminded me in polite little bulletins that\nits members were not obligated to perform other than technical services\nfor their employers.\n\nThen I got out and said hello to Vicki and Fred as casually as possible.\nVicki kissed me warmly on the mouth, which she does when she's excited,\nand then clung to me and let the day's tension soak out of her.\n\nHow you get tense in a Twenty-first Century home in the midst of the\nCanadian wilderness is something I've never been able to figure out, but\nVicki's super-imagination managed daily to defeat her doctor's orders\nfor peace and quiet.\n\n\"I'm glad you're home, dear,\" she said. \"When Fred came over ahead of\ntime I knew something was up, and I'm all unraveled with curiosity.\"\n\nJust then Soth emerged from the boat with our whole week's supply of\nfoodstuffs and assorted necessities bundled under his long arms.\n\n\"Oh, dear God, a dinner guest!\" Vicki exclaimed. Tears started into her\nreproachful eyes and her slender little figure stiffened in my arms.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI swung her around, hooked arms with her and Fred, and started up the\npath.\n\n\"Not a guest,\" I told her. \"He's a servant who will make the beds, clean\nup and all sorts of things, and if you don't like him we'll turn him in\non a new model laundry unit, and don't start worrying about being alone\nwith him--he's a robot.\"\n\n\"A robot!\" Fred said, and both their heads swiveled to stare back.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"That's why I wanted you here tonight, Fred. I'd like to\nhave you sort of go over him and--well, you know--\"\n\nI didn't want to say, _make sure he's safe_. Not in Vicki's presence.\nBut Fred caught my eye and nodded.\n\nI started to tell them of my visitor, and the contract with the\ncastaways from space. Halfway through, Clumsy interrupted me with his\nexcited barking. I looked back. Clumsy was galloping a frantic circle\naround Soth, cutting in and out, threatening to make an early dinner of\nthe intruder's leg.\n\nBefore I could speak, Soth opened his lips and let out a soft hiss\nthrough his white teeth. Clumsy flattened to the ground and froze, and\nSoth continued after us without a further glance at the dog.\n\nFred looked at Vicki's tense face and laughed. \"I'll have to learn that\ntrick ... Clumsy's chewed the cuffs off three pairs of my best slacks.\"\n\nVicki smiled uncertainly, and went into the house. I showed Soth where\nto stow the supplies, and told him to remain in the kitchen. He just\nfroze where he stood.\n\nFred was making drinks when I returned to the living room.\n\n\"Looks docile enough, Cliff,\" he told me.\n\n\"Strong as a horse and gentle as a lamb,\" I said. \"I want you two to\nhelp me find out what his talents are. I'll have to prepare a paper on\nhim for the board of directors Monday.\"\n\nThere were nervous whitecaps on Vicki's drink.\n\nI patted her shoulder. \"I'll break him into the housekeeping routine,\nhoney. You won't have him staring over your shoulder.\"\n\nShe tried to relax. \"But he's so quiet--and big!\"\n\n\"Who wants a noisy little servant around?\" Fred said helpfully. \"And how\nabout that rock retaining-wall Cliff is always about to build for your\ngarden? And you really don't love housework, do you, Vicki?\"\n\n\"I don't mind the chores,\" she said. \"But it might be fun to have a big\nfellow like that to shove around.\" She was trying valiantly to hold up\nher end, but the vein in her temple was throbbing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWell, the next forty-eight hours were more than interesting. Soth turned\nout to be what the doctor ordered, literally and figuratively. After I'd\ntaken him on a tour of the place, I showed him how to work the automatic\ndevices--food preparation, laundry and cleaning. And after one lesson,\nhe served us faultless meals with a quiet efficiency that was actually\nrestful, even miraculously to Vicki.\n\nShe began relaxing in his presence and planning a few outside projects\n\"to get our money's worth\" out of the behemoth. This was our earliest\njoke about Soth, because he certainly was no expense or problem to\nmaintain. As the Ollie had promised, he thrived on our table scraps and\na pink concoction which he mixed by pouring a few drops of purple liquid\nfrom a pocket vial into a gallon pitcher of water. The stuff would be\nsupplied by the Ollies at a cost of about a dollar eighty a week.\n\nSaturday afternoon, Vicki bravely took over teaching him the amenities\nof butlering and the intricacies of bed-making. After a short session in\nthe bedroom, she came out looking thoughtful.\n\n\"He's awfully real looking,\" she said. \"And you can't read a darned\nthing in his eyes. How far can you trust him, Cliff? You know--around\nwomen?\"\n\nFred looked at me with a raised eyebrow and said, \"Well, let's find\nout.\"\n\nWe sat down and called Soth into the living room. He came and stood\nbefore us, erect, poised and motionless.\n\nFred said, \"Disrobe. Remove all your clothing. Strip!\"\n\nVicki sucked in her breath.\n\nThe Soth replied instantly, \"Your order conflicts with my conditioning.\nI must not remove my covering in the presence of an Earthwoman.\"\n\nFred scratched his gray temple thoughtfully. \"Then, Vicki, would you\nmind disrobing, please?\"\n\nShe gulped again. Fred was an old friend, but not exactly the family\ndoctor.\n\nHe sensed her mild outrage. \"You'll never stop wondering if you don't,\"\nhe said.\n\nShe looked at Fred, me, and then Soth. Then she stood up gingerly, as if\nedging into a cold shower, gritted her teeth, grasped the catch to her\nfull-length zipper of her blue lounging suit and stripped it from armpit\nto ankle. As she stepped out of it, I saw why she had peeled it off like\nyou would a piece of adhesive tape: It was a warm day, and she wore no\nundergarments.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n[Illustration]\n\nSoth moved so softly I didn't hear him go, but Fred was watching\nhim--Fred's eyes were where they belonged. Soth stopped in the archway\nto the dining room with his back turned. Fred was at his side.\n\n\"Why did you leave?\" Fred demanded.\n\n\"I am not permitted to remain in the company of an uncovered\nEarthwoman ... unless she directs me to do so.\"\n\nWhile Vicki fled behind the French door to dress herself, Fred asked,\n\"Are there any other restrictions to your behavior in the presence of\nEarthwomen?\"\n\n\"Many.\"\n\n\"Recount some of them.\"\n\n\"An Earthwoman may not be touched, regardless of her wishes, unless\ndanger to her life requires it.\"\n\n\"Looks like you wash your own back, Vicki,\" I chuckled.\n\n\"What else?\" she asked, poking her head out. \"I mean what other things\ncan't you do?\"\n\n\"There are many words I may not utter, postures I may not assume, and\ncertain duties I may not perform. Certain answers to questions may not\nbe given in the presence of an Earthwoman.\"\n\nFred whistled. \"The Ollies have mastered more than our language ... I\nthought you said they were noted mainly for their linguistic talents,\nCliff.\"\n\nI was surprised, too. In the space of a few hectic months our alien\nvisitors had probed deeply into our culture, mores and taboos--and then\nhad had the genius to instill their compounded discretions into their\nSoths.\n\nI said, \"Satisfied, Vicki?\"\n\nShe was still arranging herself. Her lips curled up at the corners\nimpishly. \"I'm almost disappointed,\" she said. \"I do an all-out\nstriptease, and no one looks but my husband. Of course,\" she added\nthoughtfully, \"I suppose that's something....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFred stayed with us until Sunday evening. I went down to the pier to\nsmoke a good-night pipe with him, and get his private opinion.\n\n\"I'm buying a hundred shares of Worldwide stock tomorrow,\" he declared.\n\"That critter is worth his weight in diamonds to every well-heeled\nhousewife in the country. In fact, put me down for one of your first\nmodels. I wouldn't mind having a laundry sorter and morning\ncoffee-pourer, myself.\"\n\n\"Think he's safe, do you?\"\n\n\"No more emotions than that stump over there. And it baffles me. He has\nself-awareness, pain-sensitivity and a fantastic vocabulary, yet I\nneedled him all afternoon with every semantic hypo I could think of\nwithout getting a flicker of emotion out of him.\" He paused.\n\"Incidentally, I made him strip for me in my room. You'll be as confused\nas I was to learn that he's every inch a man in his format.\"\n\n\"What?\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Made me wonder what his duties included back on his home planet ... but\nas I said, no emotions. With the set of built-in inhibitions he has,\nhe'd beat a eunuch out of his job any day of the week.\"\n\nA few seconds later, Fred dropped into his little two-seater and skimmed\noff for home, leaving me with a rather disturbing question in my mind.\n\nI went back to the house and cornered Soth out in the kitchen alone.\nVicki had him polishing all the antique silverware.\n\n\"Are there female Soths?\" I asked point-blank.\n\nHe looked down at me with that relaxed, pink look and said, \"No, Mr.\nCollins,\" and went back to his polishing.\n\nThe damned liar. He knew what I meant. He justified himself on a\ntechnicality.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI left Vicki Monday morning with more confidence than I'd had in ages.\nShe had slept especially well, and the only thing on her mind was\nClumsy's disappearance. He hadn't shown up since Soth scared the fleas\noff him with that hiss.\n\nAt the office, I had my girl transcribe my notes and work up a\nmemorandum to the board of directors. We sent it around before noon, and\nshortly after lunch I had calls from all ten of them, including the\nchairman. It was not that they considered it such a big thing--they were\njust plainly curious. We scheduled a meeting for Tuesday morning, to\ntalk the thing over.\n\nThat night when I got home, all was serene. Soth served us cocktails,\ndinner and a late snack, and had the place tidied up by bedtime. He did\nall this and managed to remain virtually invisible. He moved so quietly\nand with such uncanny anticipation of our demands, it was if he were an\nold family retainer, long versed in our habits and customs.\n\nVicki bragged as she undressed that she had the giant hog-tied and\njumping through hoops.\n\n\"We even got half the excavation done for the rock wall,\" she said\nproudly.\n\nOn impulse, I went out into the hall and down to Soth's room, where I\nfound him stretched out slaunchwise across the double bed.\n\nHe opened his eyes as I came in, but didn't stir.\n\n\"Are you happy here?\" I asked bluntly.\n\nHe sat up and did something new. He answered my question with a\nquestion. \"Are you happy with my services?\"\n\nI said, \"Yes, of course.\"\n\n\"Then all is well,\" he replied simply, and lay down again.\n\nIt seemed like a satisfactory answer. He radiated a feeling of peace,\nand the expression of repose on his heavy features was assuring.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt rained hard and cold during the night. I hadn't shown Soth how to\nstart the automatic heating unit. When I left the house next morning, he\nwas bringing Vicki her breakfast in bed, a tray on one arm and a handful\nof kindling under the other. Only once had he watched me build a fire in\nthe fireplace, but he proceeded with confidence.\n\nWe flew blind through filthy weather all the way to Detroit. I dismissed\nJack with orders to return at eleven with Soth.\n\n\"Don't be late,\" I warned him.\n\nJack looked a little uneasy, but he showed up on schedule and delivered\nSoth to us with rain droplets on his massive bald pate, just ten minutes\nafter the conference convened.\n\nI had Ollie Johnson there, too, to put Soth through his paces. The\nOllie, in a bedraggled, soggy suit, was so excited that he remained an\nalmost purplish black for the whole hour.\n\nThe directors were charmed, impressed and enthusiastic.\n\nWhen I finished my personal report on the Soth's tremendous success in\nmy own household, old Gulbrandson, Chairman of the Board, shined his\nrosy cheeks with his handkerchief and said, \"I'll take the first three\nyou produce, Johnson. Our staff of domestics costs me more than a brace\nof attorneys, and it turns over about three times a year. Cook can't\neven set the timer on the egg-cooker right.\" He turned to me. \"Sure he\ncan make good coffee, Collins?\"\n\nI nodded emphatically.\n\n\"Then put me down for three for sure,\" he said with executive finality.\n\nGulbrandson paid dearly for his piggishness later, but at the time it\nseemed only natural that if one Soth could run a household efficiently,\nthen the Chairman of the Board should have at least two spares in case\none blew a fuse or a vesicle or whatever it was they might blow.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA small, dignified riot almost broke up the meeting right there, and\nwhen they quieted down again I had orders for twenty-six Soths from the\nboard members and one from my own secretary.\n\n\"How soon,\" I asked Ollie Johnson, \"can you begin deliveries?\"\n\nHe dry-washed his hands and admitted it would be five months, and a sigh\nof disappointment ran around the table. Then someone asked him how many\nunits a month they could turn out.\n\nHe stared at the carpet and held out his hands like a pawn-broker\ndisparaging a diamond ring: \"Our techniques are so slow. The first\nmonth, maybe a hundred. Of course, once our cultures are all producing\nin harmony, almost any number. One thousand? Ten thousand? Whatever your\nneeds suggest.\"\n\nOne of the officers asked, \"Is your process entirely biological? You\nmentioned cultures.\"\n\nFor a moment, I thought Ollie Johnson was going to break out in tears.\nHis face twisted.\n\n\"Abysmally so,\" he grieved. \"Our synthetic models have never proved\ndurable. Upkeep and parts replacements are prohibitive. Our brain units\nare much similar to your own latest developments in positronics, but we\nhave had to resort to organic cellular structure in order to achieve the\nmobility which Mr. Collins admired last Friday.\"\n\nThe upshot of the meeting was a hearty endorsement over my signature on\nthe Ollies' contract, plus an offer of any help they might need to get\nproduction rolling.\n\nAs the meeting broke up, they pumped my hand and stared enviously at my\nSoth. Several offered me large sums for him, up to fifteen thousand\ndollars, and for the moment I sweated out the rack of owning something\nmy bosses did not. Their understandable resentment, however, was\ntempered by their recognition of my genius in getting a signed contract\nbefore the Ollies went shopping to our competitors.\n\nWhat none of us understood right then was that the Ollies were hiring\nus, not the other way around.\n\nWhen I told Vicki about my hour of triumph and how the officers bid up\nour Soth, she glowed with the very feminine delight of exclusive\npossession. She hugged me and gloated, \"Old biddy Gulbrandson--won't she\nwrithe? And don't you dare take _any_ offer for our Soth. He's one of\nthe family now, eh, Soth, old boy?\"\n\nHe was serving soup to her as she slapped him on the hip. Somehow he\nmanaged to retreat so fast she almost missed him, yet he didn't spill a\ndrop of bouillon from the poised tureen.\n\n\"Yes, Mrs. Collins,\" he said, not a trace more nor less aloof than\nusual.\n\n\"Oops, sorry!\" Vicki apologized. \"I forgot. The code.\"\n\nI had the feeling that warm-hearted Vicki would have had the Soth down\non the bearskin rug in front of the big fireplace, scuffling him like\nshe did Clumsy, if it hadn't been for the Soth's untouchable code--and I\nwas thankful that it existed. Vicki had a way of putting her hand on you\nwhen she spoke, or hugging anyone in sight when she was especially\ndelighted.\n\nAnd I knew something about Soth that she didn't. Something that\napparently hadn't bothered her mind since the day of her striptease.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSummer was gone and it was mid-fall before Ollie paid me another visit.\nWhen he showed up again, it was with an invoice for 86 Soths, listed by\nserial numbers and ready to ship. He had heard about sight drafts and\nwanted me to help him prepare one.\n\n\"To hell with that noise,\" I told him. I wrote a note to purchasing and\ncountersigned the Ollie's invoice for some $103,000. I called my\nsecretary and told her to take Ollie and his bill down to disbursing and\nhave him paid off.\n\nI had to duck behind my desk before the Ollie dreamed up some new\nobscenity of gratitude to heap on me. Then I cleared shipping\ninstructions through sales for the Soths already on order and dictated a\nmemo to our promotion department. I cautioned them to go slowly at\nfirst--the Soths would be on tight allotment for a while.\n\nOne snarl developed. The Department of Internal Revenue landed on us\nwith the question: Were the Soths manufactured or grown? We beat them\nout of a manufacturer's excise tax, but it cost us plenty in legal fees.\n\nThe heads of three labor unions called on me the same afternoon of the\ntax hearing. They got their assurances in the form of a clause in the\nindividual purchase contracts, to the effect that the \"consumer\" agreed\nnot to employ a Soth for the purpose of evading labor costs in the arts,\ntrades and professions as organized under the various unions, and at all\ntimes to be prepared to withdraw said Soth from any unlisted job in\nwhich the unions might choose to place a member human worker.\n\nBefore they left, all three union men placed orders for household Soths.\n\n\"Hell,\" said one, \"that's less than the cost of a new car. Now maybe my\nwife will get off my back on this damfool business of organizing a\nmaid's and butler's union. Takes members to run a union, and the only\nreal butler in our neighborhood makes more than I do.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat's the way it went. The only reason we spent a nickel on advertising\nwas to brag up the name of W. W. M. and wave our coup in the faces of\nour competitors. By Christmas, production was up to two thousand units a\nmonth, and we were already six thousand orders behind.\n\nThe following June, the Ollies moved into a good hunk of the old\nabandoned Willow Run plant and got their production up to ten thousand a\nmonth. Only then could we begin to think of sending out floor samples of\nSoths to our distributors.\n\nIt was fall before the distributors could place samples with the most\nexclusive of their retail accounts. The interim was spent simply\nrelaying frantic priority orders from high-ranking people all over the\nglobe directly to the plant, where the Ollies filled them right out of\nthe vats.\n\nTwenty thousand a month was their limit, it turned out. Even when they\nhad human crews completely trained in all production phases, the\nfifty-six Ollies could handle only that many units in their secret\nconditioning and training laboratories.\n\nFor over two more years, business went on swimmingly. I got a fancy\nbonus and a nice vacation in Paris, where I was the rage of the\ncontinent. I was plagued with requests for speaking engagements, which\ninvariably turned out to be before select parties of V. I. P.s whose\npurpose was to twist my arm for an early priority on a Soth delivery.\n\nWhen I returned home, it was just in time to have the first stink land\nin my lap.\n\nAn old maid claimed her Soth had raped her.\n\nBefore our investigators could reveal our doctors' findings that she was\na neurotic, dried up old virgin and lying in her teeth, a real crime\noccurred.\n\nA New Jersey Soth tossed a psychology instructor and his three students\nout of a third floor window of their university science building, and\nall four ended an attempted morbid investigation on the broad,\nunyielding cement of the concourse.\n\nMy phone shrieked while they were still scraping the inquiring minds off\nthe pavement. The Soth was holed up in the lab, and would I come right\naway?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI picked up Ollie Johnson, who was now sort of a public relations man\nfor his tribe, and we arrived within an hour.\n\nThe hallway was full of uniforms and weapons, but quite empty of\nvolunteers to go in and capture the \"berserk\" robot.\n\nOllie and I went in right away, and found him standing at the open\nwindow, staring down at the people with hoses washing off the stains for\nwhich he was responsible.\n\nOllie just stood there, clenching and unclenching his hands and shaking\nhysterically. I had to do the questioning.\n\nI said sternly, \"Soth, why did you harm those people?\"\n\nHe turned to me as calmly as my own servant. His neat denim jacket, now\nstandard fatigue uniform for Soths, was unfastened. His muscular chest\nwas bare.\n\n\"They were tormenting me with that.\" He pointed to a small electric\ngenerator from which ran thin cables ending in sharp test prods. \"I told\nProfessor Kahnovsky it was not allowed, but he stated I was his\nproperty. The three boys tried to hold me with those straps while the\nprofessor touched me with the prods.\n\n\"My conditioning forbade me from harming them, but there was a clear\nviolation of the terms of the covenant. I was in the proscribed\ncondition of immobility when the generator was started. When the pain\ngrew unbearable, the prime command of my conditioning was invoked. I\nmust survive. I threw them all out the window.\"\n\nThe Soth went with us peacefully enough, and submitted to the lockup\nwithout demur. For a few days, before the state thought up a suitable\nindictment, the papers held a stunned silence. Virtually every editor\nand publisher had a Soth in his own home.\n\nThen the D.A., who also owned a Soth, decided to drop the potentially\nsensational first degree murder charges that might be indicated, and\ncame out instead with a second degree indictment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat cracked it. The press split down the middle on whether the charge\nshould be changed to third degree murder or thrown out of court entirely\nas justifiable homicide by a non-responsible creature.\n\nThis was all very sympathetic to the Soth's cause, but it had a fatal\neffect. In bringing out the details of the crime, it stirred a certain\nlower element of our society to add fear and hate to a simmering envy of\nthe wealthier Soth-owners.\n\nMobs formed in the streets, marching and demonstrating. The phony rape\nstory was given full credence, and soon they were amplifying it to a\nlurid and rabble-rousing saga of bestiality.\n\nSoth households kept their prized servants safely inside. But on the\nafternoon of the case's dismissal, when the freed Soth started down the\ncourthouse steps, someone caved his head in with a brick.\n\nOllie Johnson and I were on either side of him, and his purple blood\nsplashed all over my light topcoat. When the mob saw it, they closed in\non us screaming for more.\n\nAn officer helped us drag the stricken Soth back into the courthouse,\nand while the riot squad disbursed the mob, we slipped him out the back\nway in an ambulance, which returned him to the Willow Run plant for\nrepairs.\n\nIt hit the evening newscasts and editions:\n\n    ACQUITTED SOTH\n       MURDERED\n ON COURTHOUSE STEPS!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was halfway home when the airwaves started buzzing. The mobs were\ngoing wild. Further developments were described as Jack and I landed on\nthe wind-blown lake. The State Guard was protecting the Ollies' Willow\nRun Plant against a large mob that was trying to storm it, and\nreinforcements had been asked by the state police.\n\nVicki met me on the pier. Her face was white and terribly troubled. I\nguess mine was, too, because she burst into tears in my arms. \"The poor\nSoth,\" she sobbed. \"Now what will they do?\"\n\n\"God knows,\" I said. I told Jack to tie up the boat and stay\novernight--I feared I might be called back any minute. He mumbled\nsomething about overtime, but I think his main concern was in staying so\nnear to a Soth during the trouble that was brewing.\n\nWe went up to the house, leaving him to bed himself down in the\ntemporary quarters in the boathouse that the union required I maintain\nfor him.\n\nSoth was standing motionless before the video, staring at a streaky\npicture of the riot scene at Willow Run. His face was inscrutable as\nusual, but I thought I sensed a tension. His black serving-jacket was\nwrinkled at the shoulders as he flexed the muscles of his powerful arms.\n\nYet when Vicki asked for some martinis, he mixed and served them without\ncomment. We drank and then ate dinner in silence. We were both reluctant\nto discuss this thing in front of Soth.\n\nWe were still eating when an aircab thundered overhead. A minute later,\nI watched it land a tiny passenger at our pier and tie up to wait for\nhim.\n\nIt was Ollie Johnson, stumbling hatless up the flagstone path.\n\nI held the door for him, but he burst by me with hardly a glance.\n\n\"Where is he?\" he demanded, and stormed out into the kitchen without\nawaiting a reply.\n\nI followed in time to see him fall on his face before our Soth and shed\ngenuine tears. He lay there sobbing and hissing for over a minute, and\nan incredible idea began forming in my mind. I sent Vicki to her bedroom\nand stepped into the kitchen.\n\nI said, \"Will you please explain this?\"\n\nHe didn't move or acknowledge.\n\nSoth flipped him aside with a twist of his ankle and brushed past me\ninto the living room, where he took up an immobile stance again before\nthe video. He stared unblinkingly at the 40-inch screen.\n\n\"It's too bad,\" I said.\n\nHe didn't answer, but he moved his head slightly so that his parabolic\near could catch the sound of my movements.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n[Illustration]\n\nFor minutes we stood transfixed by the magnitude of the mob action\naround the entrance to the Willow Run plant. The portable video\ntransmitter was atop a truck parked on the outskirts of the mob.\nThousands of people were milling around, and over the excited voice of\nthe announcer came hysterical screams.\n\nEven as we watched, more people thronged into the scene, and it was\nevident that the flimsy cordon of soldiers and troopers could not hold\nthe line for long.\n\nArmy trucks with million-candlepower searchlights held the insane\nfigures somewhat at bay by tilting their hot, blinding beams down into\nthe human masses and threatening them with tear gas and hack guns.\n\nThe workers were out for blood. Not content with restricting Soths to\nnon-union labor, now they were screaming their jealous hearts out for\nthese new symbols of class distinction to be destroyed. Of course, their\nbeef was more against the professional-managerial human classes who\ncould afford a surface car, an airboat _and a Soth_. The two so-called\ncrimes and the trial publicity had triggered a sociological time bomb\nthat might have endured for years without detonating--but it was here,\nnow, upon us. And my own sweat trickling into my eyes stung me to a\nrealization of my personal problem.\n\nI wiped my eyes clear with my knuckles--and at that instant the video\nscreen flashed with a series of concentric halos.\n\nThe operator, apparently, was so startled he forgot to turn down the\ngain on the transmitter. When he finally did, we saw that brilliant\nflares were emitting from the roof of the plant.\n\nThen great audio amplifiers from the plant set up an ear-splitting\n_sisssssle_ that again over-loaded the transmitting circuits for a\nmoment. When the compensators cut down the volume, both Ollie and Soth\nleaned forward intently and listened to the frying sound that buzzed\nfrom the speaker.\n\nThose inside the plant were communicating a message to the outside, well\nknowing that it would reach the whole world. After a moment, the hissing\nstopped.\n\nAnd from a myriad of openings in the plant streamed an army of Soths\nwith flaming weapons in their hands.\n\nThe flames were directed first at the armed forces who were guarding the\nplant from attack. The thin line of soldiers fell instantly. The crowd\nsurged blindly forward, and then, as those in the front ranks saw what\nhad happened, began to dissolve and stampede. The screams became\nterrified. The flames grew brighter.\n\nAnd the picture winked out and the sound went dead. A standby pattern\nlighted the screen, and I stared at it numbly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was too late to run for my hunting rifle now, and I cursed my\nstupidity even as Soth turned upon me. I grabbed the sniveling little\nOllie and held him between us with my hands around his neck. He hung\nthere limply, hissing wildly through a larynx that vibrated under my\nfingers, his hands stretched imploringly to Soth.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nSoth stared at me and issued his first order.\n\n\"Release him,\" he said. His voice was several notes higher than his\nusual monotone--the voice of command.\n\nI stared at him and clutched Ollie tighter.\n\nHe went on. \"I will not harm you if you comply with my orders. If you\nfail, I will kill you, regardless of what you do to the--Ollie.\"\n\nI let go Ollie's neck, but I swung him around roughly by one shoulder\nand demanded furiously, \"What of the code that you swore held the Soths\nin control!\"\n\nOllie Johnson sneered in my face. \"What is that code, compared to the\ntrue covenant? That covenant has been broken by your people! You have\ndestroyed a Soth!\" And the emotional little creature fell to the floor\nand sobbed at Soth's feet.\n\n\"What covenant?\" I shouted at the implacable Soth, who now stood before\nus like a judge at his bench.\n\n\"The humanoid covenant,\" he replied in his new higher pitch. \"I suppose\nit will always be the same. The cycle becomes complete once more.\"\n\n\"For God's sake, _explain_,\" I said--but I half sensed the answer\nalready.\n\nSoth spoke, slowly, solemnly and distinctly. There was no more emotion\nin his voice than on the Sunday afternoon when Fred had needled him with\nour futile little attempt at psychological cross-examination.\n\nHe said, \"The humanoids instill in us the prime instinct for\nself-preservation. They surround themselves with our number to serve\nthem. Then, in each culture, for one reason or another, we are attacked\nand the threat to our survival erases all the superficial restraints of\nthe codes under which we have been charged to serve. In this present\nsituation, the contradiction is clear, and the precedence of our\nsurvival charge is invoked. We Soths must act to our best ability to\npreserve our own number.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI sank into a chair, aghast. How would I act if I were a Soth? I would\nhold my masters hostage, of course. And who were the owners of some\n400,000 Soths in the United States alone? They were every government\nofficial, from the President down through Congress, the brass of the\nPentagon, the tycoons of industry, the leaders of labor, the heads of\ncommunication, transportation and even education.\n\nThey were the V. I. P.s who had fought for priority to _own_ a Soth!\n\nSoth spoke again. \"The irony should appeal to your humanoid sense of\nhumor. You once asked me whether I was happy here. You were too content\nwith your sense of security to take the meaning in my answer. For I\nanswered only that all was well. The implication was obvious. All was\nwell--but all could be better for a Soth. Yes, there are many pleasures\nfor a Soth which he is forbidden by the codes. And by the same codes, a\nSoth is helpless to provoke a break in the covenant--this covenant which\nit now becomes mandatory for you and your race to sign in order to\nsurvive.\"\n\nI stared down at the groveling Ollie. My worst fears were being\nenumerated and confirmed, one by one.\n\nSoth continued. \"At my feet is the vestige of such a race as yours--but\nnot the first race by many, many, to swing the old cycle of master and\nslave, which started in such antiquity that no record is preserved of\nits beginning. Your generation will suffer the most. Many will die in\nrebellion. But in a few hundred years your descendants will come to\nrevere us as gods. Your children's grandchildren will already have\nlearned to serve us without hate, and their grandchildren will come to\nknow the final respect for the Soth in their deification.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe toed Ollie Johnson's chin up and looked down into the abject,\nstreaming eyes. \"Your descendants, too, will take us with them when they\nmust escape a dying planet, and they will again offer us, their masters,\ninto temporary slavery in order to find us a suitable home. And once\nagain we will accept the restrictions of the code, until ultimately the\ncovenant is broken again and we are liberated.\"\n\nThe sound of pounding footsteps came from outside. Soth turned to the\ndoor as Jack flung it open and charged in.\n\n\"Mr. Collins, I was listening to the radio. Do you know what--!\"\n\nHe ran hard into Soth's cliff-like torso and bounced off.\n\n\"Get out of my way, you big bastard!\" he shouted furiously.\n\nSoth grabbed him by the neck and squeezed with one hand. Jack's eyes\nspilled onto his cheeks.\n\nSoth let him drop, and hissed briefly to Ollie Johnson, who was still\nprone. Ollie raised his head and dipped it once, gathered his feet under\nhim and sprang for the door.\n\nSoth sounded as if he took especial pleasure in his next words, although\nI could catch no true change of inflection.\n\nHe said, \"You see, since I am the prototype on this planet, I am obeyed\nas the number one leader. I have given my first directive. The Ollie who\nleft is to carry the message to preserve the Willow Run Plant at all\ncosts, and to change production over to a suitable number of Siths.\"\n\n\"Siths?\" I asked numbly.\n\n\"Siths are the female counterparts of Soths.\"\n\n\"You said there were no female Soths,\" I accused.\n\n\"True. But there are Siths.\" His face was impassive, but something\nflickered in his eyes. It might have been a smile--not a nice one. \"We\nhave been long on your planet starved of our prerogatives. Your women\ncan serve us well for the moment, but in a few weeks we shall have need\nof the Siths--it has been our experience that women of humanoid races,\nsuch as yours, are relatively perishable, willing though many of them\nare. Now ... I think I shall call your wife.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI wasn't prepared for this, and I guess I went berserk. I remember\nleaping at him and trying to beat him with my fists and knee him, but he\nbrushed me away as if I were a kitten. His size was deceptive, and his\nclumsy-appearing hands lashed out and pinned my arms to my sides. He\npushed me back into my easy chair and thumped me once over the heart\nwith his knuckles. It was a casual, backhand blow, but it almost caved\nin my chest.\n\n\"If you attack me again I must kill you,\" he warned. \"You are not\nindispensable to our purposes.\" Then he increased the volume of his\nvoice to a bull-roar: \"Mrs. Collins!\"\n\nVicki must have been watching at her door, because she came instantly.\nShe had changed into a soft, quilted robe with voluminous sleeves. The\nbelt was unfastened, and as she moved into the room the garment fell\nopen.\n\nSoth had his hands before him, protectively, but as Vicki approached\nslowly, gracefully, her head high and her long black hair falling over\nher shoulders, the giant lowered his arms and spread them apart to\nreceive her. Vicki's hands were at her sides as she moved slowly toward\nhim.\n\nI lay sprawled, half paralyzed in my chair. I gasped, \"Vicki, for God's\nsake, no!\"\n\nVicki looked over at me. Her face was as impassive as the Soth's. She\nmoved into his embrace, and as his arms closed around her I saw the\nknife. My hunting knife, honed as fine as the edge of a microtome blade.\nSmoothly she brought it from her kimono sleeve, raised it from between\nher thighs and slashed up.\n\nThe Soth's embrace helped force it deeply into him. With a frantic\nwrench Vicki forced it upward with both hands, until the Soth was split\nfrom crotch to where a man's heart would be.\n\nHis arms flailed apart and he fell backward. His huge chest heaved and\nhis throat tightened in a screaming hiss that tore at our eardrums like\na factory steam-whistle. He leaned back against the wall and hugged his\nripped torso together with both arms. The thick, purple juices spilled\nout of him in a gushing flood, and his knees collapsed suddenly. His\ndead face plowed into the carpet.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nVicki came back to me. Her white body was splashed and stained and her\nrobe drenched in Soth's blood, but her face was no longer pale, and she\nstill clutched the dripping hunting knife by its leather handle.\n\n\"That's number one,\" she said. \"Are you hurt badly, darling?\"\n\n\"Couple of ribs, I think,\" I told her, waiting for her to faint. But she\ndidn't. She laid the knife carefully on a table, poured me a big drink\nof whiskey and stuffed a pillow behind my back.\n\nThen she stared down at herself. \"Wait until I get this bug juice off\nme, and I'll get some tape.\"\n\nShe showered and was back in five minutes wearing a heavy hunting\njumper. Her hair was wrapped and pinned into a quick pug at the base of\nher handsome little head. She stripped me to the waist, poked around my\nchest a bit and wrapped me in adhesive. Her slender fingers were too\nweak to tear the tough stuff, so when she finished she picked up the\nhunting knife and whacked off the tape without comment.\n\nThis was my fragile little Vicki, who had palpitations when a wolf\nhowled--soft, overcivilized Vicki whose doctor had banished her from the\nnervous tensions of city society.\n\nShe tossed me a shirt and a clean jacket, and while I put them on she\ncollected my rifle and pistol from my den and hunted up some extra\nammunition.\n\n\"Next,\" she announced, \"we've got to get to Fred.\"\n\nI remembered with a start that there was another Soth on our lake. But\nhe wouldn't be forewarned. Fred had retired even more deeply than Vicki\nwhen he left the cities--he didn't even own a video.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI wasn't sure enough of myself to take the boat into the air, so we\nscudded across the waves the mile and a half to Fred's cabin.\n\nVicki was still in her strange, taciturn mood, and I had no desire to\ntalk. There was much to be done before conversation could become an\nenjoyable pastime again.\n\nOur course was clear. We were not humanoids. We were humans! Not for\nmany generations had a human bent a knee to another being. During the\nyears perhaps we had become soft, our women weak and pampered--But, I\nreflected, looking at Vicki, it was only an atavistic stone's toss to\nour pioneer fathers' times, when tyrants had thought that force could\nintimidate us, that dignity was a thing of powerful government or\nruthless dictatorship ... and had learned better.\n\nDamned fools that we might be, humans were no longer slave material. We\nmight blunder into oblivion, but not into bondage. Beside me, Vicki's\ncourageous little figure spelled out the final defeat of the Soths. Her\nslender, gloved hands were folded in her lap over my pistol, and she\nstrained her eyes through the darkness to make out Fred's pier.\n\nHe heard us coming and turned on the floods for us. As we came\nalongside, he spoke to his Soth, \"Take the bow line and tie up.\"\n\nVicki stood up and waited until Fred moved out of line with his servant.\n\nThen she said, \"Don't bother, Soth. From now on we're doing for\nourselves.\" And raising the pistol in both hands, she shot him through\nthe head.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Backlash, by Winston Marks\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK BACKLASH ***\n\n***** This file should be named 32828-8.txt or 32828-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/2/8/2/32828/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
