He paused now to look out over the sea of faces that\nfilled the great hall in serried waves. He half turned that he might let\nhis eyes pass over the massed company on the platform with him. The\nStratosphere Control Board--and they had called in their representatives\nfrom the far corners of Earth to hear the memorable words of this aged\nman.\n\n[Illustration: _The beasts fell into the pit beyond; their screams rang\nhorribly as they fell._]\n\nFrom the waiting audience came no slightest sound; the men and women\nwere as silent as that other audience listening and watching in every\nhamlet of the world, wherever radio and television reached. Again the\nfigure of the President was drawn erect; the scanty, white hair was\nthrown back from his forehead; he was speaking:\n\n\" ... And this vast development has come within the memory of one man.\nI, speaking to you here in this year of 1974, have seen it all come to\npass. And now I am overwhelmed with the wonder of it, even as I was when\nthose two Americans first flew at Kittyhawk.\n\n\"I, myself, saw that. I saw with these eyes the first crude\nengine-bearing kites; I saw them from 1914 to 1918 tempered and\nperfected in the furnace of war; I saw the coming of detonite and the\nbeginning of our air-transport of to-day. And always I have seen brave\nmen--men who smiled grimly as they took those first crude controls in\ntheir hands; who laughed and waved to us as they took off in the 'flying\ncoffins' of the great war; who had the courage to dare the unknown\ndangers of the high levels and who first threw their ships through the\nRepelling Area and blazed the air-trails of a new world.\n\n\"And to-day I, who have seen all this, stand before you and say: 'Thank\nGod that the spirit of brave men goes on!'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It has never ended--that adventurer strain--that race of Viking men. We\nhave two of them here to-night. The whole world is pausing this instant\nwherever men are on land or water or air to do honor to these two.\n\n\"They do not know why they are here. They have been summoned by the\nStratosphere Control Board which has delegated to me the honor of making\nthe announcement.\"\n\nThe tall figure was commandingly erect; for an instant the fire of youth\nhad returned to him.\n\n\"Walter Harkness!\" he called. \"Chester Bullard! Stand forth that the\neyes of the world may see!\"\n\nTwo men arose from among the members of the Board and came hesitantly\nforward. Strongly contrasting was the darkly handsome face of Harkness,\nman of wealth and Pilot of the Second Class, and the no less pleasing\nfeatures of Chet Bullard, Master Pilot of the World. For Bullard's\ncurling hair was as golden as the triple star upon his chest that\nproclaimed his standing to the world and all the air above.\n\nThe speaker was facing them; he turned away for a moment that he might\nbow to a girl who was still seated next to the chair where Walt\nHarkness had been.\n\n\"To Mrs. Harkness,\" he said, \"who, until one month ago, was Mademoiselle\nDelacouer of our own beloved France, I shall have something further to\nsay. She, too, has been summoned by the Board, but, for now, I address\nthese two.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAgain he was facing the two men; and now he was speaking directly to\nthem:\n\n\"Pilot Harkness and Master Pilot Bullard, for you the world has been\nforced to create a new honor, a new mark of the world's esteem. For you\ntwo have done what never men have done before. We who have preceded you\nhave subdued the air; but you, gentlemen, you--the first of all created\nbeings to do so--have conquered space.\n\n\"And to you, because of your courage; because of your dauntless pioneer\nspirit; because of the unconquerable will that drove you and the\ninventive genius that made it possible--because all these have set you\nabove us more ordinary men, since they have made you the first men to\nfly through space--it is my privilege now to show you the honor in which\nyou are held by the whole world.\"\n\nThe firm voice quavered; for a moment the old hands trembled as they\nlifted a blazing gem from its velvet case.\n\n\"Chester Bullard, Master Pilot, on behalf of the Stratosphere Control\nBoard I bestow upon you--\"\n\n\"Stop!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEvery radiophone in the world must have echoed that sharp command; every\ntelevision screen must have shown to a breathless audience the figure\nwhose blond hair was awry, whose lean face was afire with protest, as\nChet Bullard sprang forward with upraised hand.\n\n\"You're wrong--dead wrong! You're making a mistake. I can't accept\nthat!\"\n\nThe master pilot's voice was raised in earnest protest. He seemed, for\nthe moment, unaware of the thousands of eyes that were upon him;\nheedless of the gasp of amazement that swept sibilantly over the vast\naudience like a hissing wave breaking upon the beach. And then his face\nflushed scarlet, though his eyes still held steadily upon the startled\ncountenance of the man who stood transfixed, while the jewel in his hand\ntook the light of the nitron illuminators above and shot it back in a\nglory of rainbow hues.\n\nFrom the seated group on the platform a man came forward. Commander of\nthe Air, this iron-gray man; he was head of the Stratosphere Control\nBoard, supreme authority on all matters that concerned the air levels of\nthe whole world; Commander-in-Chief of all men who laid hands on the\ncontrols of a ship. He spoke quietly now, and Chet Bullard, at his first\nword, snapped instantly to salute, then stood silently waiting.\n\n\"What is the meaning of this?\" demanded the voice of authority. The\nvoice seemed soft, almost gentle, yet each syllable carried throughout\nthe hall with an unmistakable hint of the hardness of a steelite shell\nbeneath the words.\n\n\"The eyes of the world are upon us here; the whole world is gathered to\ndo you honor. Is it possible that you are refusing that which we offer?\nWhy? You will speak, please!\"\n\nAnd Chet Bullard, standing stiffly at attention before his commander,\nspoke in a tone rendered almost boyish by embarrassment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I can't accept, sir. Pilot Harkness will bear me out in this. You would\ndecorate us for being the first to navigate space; but we are not the\nfirst.\"\n\n\"Continue!\" ordered the quiet voice as Chet paused. \"You refer to\nHaldgren, probably.\"\n\n\"To Pilot Haldgren, sir.\"\n\n\"This is absurd! Haldgren was lost. It is supposed that he fell back\ninto the sea, or struck some untraveled part of Earth.\"\n\n\"I have checked over his data, sir. It is my opinion that he did not\nfall; his figures indicate that he must have thrown his ship beyond the\ngravitational influence of Earth.\"\n\nThe Commander eyed the master pilot coldly. \"And because you _think_\nthat your conclusions are more accurate than those of my own\ninvestigating committee, you refuse this honor!\n\n\"Attention!\" he snapped sharply. \"The entire Service of Air is being\nrendered ridiculous by your conduct! I command you to accept this\ndecoration.\"\n\n\"You are exceeding your authority, sir. I refuse!\"\n\nSuddenly the frozen quiet of the Commander's face was flushed red with\nrage. \"Give me that insignia!\" he demanded, and pointed to the triple\nstar on Chet Bullard's breast. \"Your commission is revoked!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo the last breathless spectator in the farthest end of the great hall\nthe white pallor of Chet Bullard's face must have been apparent. One\nhand moved toward the emblem on his blouse, the cherished triple star of\na master pilot of the World; then the hand paused.\n\n\"I have still another reason for believing Haldgren is alive,\" he said\nin a cold and carefully emotionless voice. \"Are you interested in\nhearing it?\"\n\n\"Speak!\" ordered the Commander.\n\nChet Bullard, still wearing the triple star, crossed quickly to a phone\npanel in the speaker's stand at one side of the stage. He jerked out an\ninstrument. The buzz of excited whispering that had swept the audience\ngave place to utter silence. Each quiet, incisive word that Chet spoke\nwas clearly heard. He gave his call number.\n\n\"Bullard; Master Pilot, First Class; Number U.S. 1; calling Doctor Roche\nat Allied Observatory, Mount Everest. Micro-wave, please, and connect\nthrough for telefoto-projection.\"\n\nA few breathless seconds passed, while Chet aimed an instrument of\ngleaming chromium and glass, whose cable connections vanished in the\nphone panel recess. He focused it upon an artificially darkened screen\nabove and behind the grouped figures on the stage. Then:\n\n\"Doctor Roche?\" Chet queried.\n\nAnd, before the whole audience, the dark screen came to life to show a\nclear-cut picture of a man who sat at a telescope; whose hand held a\nradiophone; and who glanced up frowningly and said: \"Yes, this is Doctor\nRoche.\"\n\nChet's response was immediate.\n\n\"Bullard speaking; Chet Bullard, at New York. When I was in your\nobservatory yesterday, Doctor, you said that you had seen flashes of\nlight on the Moon. You remember that, don't you? You saw them some\nmonths ago while I was on the Dark Moon.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe man in that distant observatory was no longer scowling at this\ninterruption of his work. His smile was echoed by the cordial tone of\nhis voice that rang clearly through the great hall.\n\n\"Correct, Mr. Bullard. An observer at our two hundred-inch reflector\nreported them on two successive nights. They were inside the crater of\nHercules.\"\n\nFrom his place at the center of the stage the waiting Commander of Air\nprotested:\n\n\"Come--come! We know all about that, Bullard. Are you trying to say--\"\n\nThe voice of the astronomer was speaking again:\n\n\"You will no doubt be interested to know that the lights occurred again\nyesterday at about this time.... Let me see if they are on now. I will\nhave the two hundred-inch instrument used as before, and will show you\nwhat we see.\n\n\"Watch your screen, but don't expect to find any substantiation of your\nwild theory that these lights have a human origin.\" He laughed softly.\n\"No atmosphere to speak of there, you know; we have determined that very\ndefinitely.\"\n\nOn the screen the picture of the smiling man flashed off; it was\nreplaced by an unflickering darkness that came abruptly into softly\nshaded light. There was an expanse of volcanic terrain and a round\norifice of tremendous size, where the sunlight cast black shadows. Other\nshaded portions about were like rocky, broken ground.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo Chet, staring at the strange conformation, came the quick sense of\nhanging above that ground and looking down upon it. And he knew that in\nNew York he was looking through a great telescope down under the world\nand was staring straight down into the throat of an extinct volcano on\nthe Moon.\n\nThere were few wonders of the modern world that could thrill the master\npilot with any feeling of amazement, but here was a new experience. He\nwould have spoken, would have ejaculated some word of wonder, but for\nthe new light that claimed his eyes and brain.\n\nThe volcano, even in death, was ages old; its cold desolation showing\nplainly on the screen. No fires poured now from a hot throat; the\nmolten sea that once had raged within had hardened and choked that vast\nthroat with rock that had frozen to make one enormous plain. Ringed\nabout by the jagged sides of the tremendous volcano, the floor within\nseemed smooth by comparison, except for another depression at its upper\nedge.\n\nHere was another and smaller crater inside the great ringed wall of\nHercules. The light of the sun struck slantingly across to throw one\nside of the gigantic cup into shadow, while the opposite rim blared\nbrightly in the lunar dawn. And within the smaller crater, too, one side\nwas dead black with shadow.\n\nDead!--No moving thing--no sign of life or indication that life might\never have been! A dead world, this!--its utter desolation struck Chet's\nhalf-uttered exclamation to a hoarse whisper of dismay. In all the\nuniverse what less likely place might one discover wherein to look for\nman?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis gaze was held in fascinated hopelessness on the barren, mountainous\nring, on the inner inverted cone, on the shadow within that smaller\ncrater--_on a tiny pinpoint of light that was flashing there!_... He\nhardly knew when he raised one trembling hand and pointed, while a voice\nquite unlike his own said huskily:\n\n\"Look! Look! I told you it was so!... There! In that little\ncrater!--it's signaling! Three dots--now three dashes--three dots again!\nThe old S O S!--the old call for help! It's Haldgren!\"\n\nAgain the screen showed the smiling scientist.\n\n\"Caught them just right,\" he said, \"and glad to be of service. Now, if\nthere's anything else I can do--\"\n\n\"Thanks!\" said Chet in that same strained voice. \"Thanks! There's\nnothing else.\" A switch clicked beneath his hand, and once more the\nscreen was dark.\n\n\"Those dots and dashes! The old S O S! Who could doubt now?\" Chet was\ntelling himself this when the Commander's voice broke in harshly.\n\n\"Even you must see the absurdity of this, Bullard. You have heard this\nastronomer tell you what the rest of us knew for ourselves--that there\nis no air on the Moon; that it is impossible for a human being to live\nthere. And you would have us believe that a man has lived there for five\nyears!\n\n\"But I am taking your distinguished record into account; I am\noverlooking your insubordination and the folly of your reasoning.\nPerhaps your feeling about Haldgren does you credit; but Haldgren is\ndead. Now I am giving you another chance: I order you to come forward\nand receive this honor, which is an honor to the entire Service of Air.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nChet was staring in open amazement. \"No air on the Moon,\" this man had\nsaid. And what of that? Neither was there air in interplanetary space,\nyet he had traveled there. It was inconceivable that this imperious and\ndictatorial man could be so blind.\n\n\"I can't do it, sir,\" he tried to explain. \"You surely can't disregard\nthat message, the old call for help. We were using that, you know, when\nHaldgren took off five years ago.\"\n\nNo longer did a masking softness overlay the hard brittleness of the\nCommander's voice.\n\n\"Your star!\" he snapped. \"You are no longer in the Service, Bullard!\"\n\nBut Chet Bullard, as he stepped forward that the Commander might rip the\ntriple star from his chest, was not alone. Walt Harkness was only a\nPilot of the Second Class, but he stripped the emblem from his own\nsilken blouse and placed it in the Commander's outstretched hand beside\nChet's star.\n\n\"Permit me, sir, to share Mr. Bullard's enviable humiliation,\" he\nobserved with venomous courtesy; and added:\n\n\"Whatever similar honors were in store for Mrs. Harkness and myself are\nrespectfully declined. We, too, are of the opinion that Pilot Haldgren\ndeserves them instead of us.\"\n\nFor an instant Chet's flashing smile drew his face into friendly lines.\n\"Thanks!\" he said.\n\nBut all friendliness was erased as he swung back upon the Commander.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNo thought now of the thousands of staring faces or of the millions\nthroughout the world who were watching him and were hearing his words.\nChet Bullard clipped those words into curt phrases, and he shot them at\nhis superior officer as if from a detonite gun:\n\n\"You think your judgment better than mine--you've dropped me from the\nService--and you've got the power to make that stick! But you're wrong,\nsir, dead wrong! And I'll make you admit it, too.\n\n\"No--don't interrupt! I'm going to say what I please, and this is it,\nCommander:\n\n\"Hang onto that jewel you were giving me. Keep it ready. For I'm going\nto the Moon. I'm going to find Haldgren, if he's still living when I get\nthere. And, at the least, I will bring back some record to show he is\nthe man we should honor.\n\n\"Haldgren, alive or dead, was the first man to conquer space. Neither\nHarkness nor I would steal an atom of his glory. I'll have the proof\nwhen I come back. And when I come--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor an instant the ready grin that marked Chet's irresistible good\nnature lighted up his face with a silent echo of some laugh-provoking\nthought occurring in his mind.\n\n\"--when I do come, Commander, I will make you eat your words. It's you\nwho will be out of the Service then, laughed out!\"\n\nThe Commander smiled, too; smiled coldly, complacently, while his head\nshook.\n\n\"Again you are mistaken,\" he told Chet; \"never again will you fly as\nmuch as one foot above Earth.\"\n\nAnd still Chet's grin persisted. \"Commander,\" he said, \"a man in your\nposition should not make so many mistakes. I am going--I give you\nwarning now--going to the Moon. And you haven't enough Patrol Ships in\nall the air levels of Earth to hold me back, once I'm on my way!\"\n\nAnd every television screen of Earth showed a remarkable scene: a\nred-faced, choleric Commander of the Air, who shouted that a group of\nofficers might leap forward to do his bidding; a dark-haired man and a\ngirl who sprang beside him. The bodies of the two were interposed for an\ninstant between the officers' weapons and a fair-haired man.... And the\nlean young man, with his shock of golden hair thrown back from his face,\nleaped like a panther in that same instant; drew himself to an open\nwindow; threw himself through, and vanished among the brilliant lights\nand black shadows of a New York night.\n\nBut, as he fought his way free of the throng outside, there came above\nthe clamor of an excited crowd the voice of Walt Harkness in cryptic\nwords:\n\n\"The ship is yours, Chet,\" the fugitive heard Harkness call; \"it's in\ncold storage for you!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n_A Dirty Red Freighter...._\n\n\nChet Bullard was more at home among the air-lanes of Earth than he was\non solid ground. But he oriented himself in an instant; knew he was on a\ncross street in the three hundred zone; and saw ahead of him, not a\nhundred feet away, the green, glowing ring that marked a subway\nescalator.\n\nIn the passing throng there were those who looked curiously at him. Chet\nchecked his first headlong flight and dropped to an unhurried walk.\n\nAbout him, as he well knew, the air was filled with silent radio waves\nthat were sounding the alarm in every sentry box of the great city. They\nwould reach the aircraft terminals and the control room of every ship\nwithin a fixed radius. He had dared the wrath of one of the most\npowerful officials of Earth; no effort would be spared to run him down;\nhis picture would be flashing within ten minutes on every television\nscreen of the Air Patrol. And Chet Bullard knew only one way to go.\n\nOf course they would be watching for him at the airports, yet he knew he\nmust get away somehow; escape quickly--and find some corner of the world\nwhere he could hide.\n\nHe was in the escalator, and wild plans were flashing through his mind\nas he watched the levels go past. \"First Level; Trains North and South;\nLocal Service. Second Level; Express Stop for North-shore Lines. Third\nLevel; Airport Loop Lines; Transatlantic Terminals--\"\n\nChet Bullard, his hair still tangled on his hatless head, his blouse\ntorn where a hand had ripped off the Master Pilot's emblem, stepped from\nthe escalator to a platform, then to a cylindrical car that slid\nsilently in before him and whose flashing announcement-board proclaimed:\n\"_Hoover Airport Express. No Intermediate Stops._\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWould they be watching for him at the great Hoover Terminal on the tip\nof Long Island? Chet assured himself silently that he would tell the\nworld they would be. But even a fugitive may have friends--if he has\nbeen a master pilot and has a lean, likable face with a most disarming\ngrin.\n\nWhere would he go? He did not know; he had been bluffing a bit and the\nCommander had called him when his hand was weak; he had no least idea\nwhere he could find their ship. If only he had had a chance for a word\nwith Walt Harkness: Walt had been flying it; he had left it apparently\nin a storage hangar.\n\nBut where? And what was it that Walt had called out? Chet was racking\nhis brains to remember.\n\n\"The ship is yours,\" Walt had shouted ... and something about \"storage.\"\nBut why should he have laid up the ship; why should he have stored it?\n\nChet saw the lights of subterranean stations flashing past as the car\nthat held him rode silently through a tube that it touched not at all.\nHe knew that magnetic rails made a grillwork that surrounded the car and\nthat drew it on at terrific speed while suspending it in air. But he\nwould infinitely have preferred the freedom of the high levels, and his\nown hand on a ship's controls.\n\nA ship!--any ship!--but preferably his ship and Walt's. And Walt had\nsaid something of \"_storage--cold storage_.\" The words seemed written\nbefore him in fiery lines. It was a moment before he knew what he had\nrecalled. Then a slow smile tugged at the corners of his mouth, and he\nturned and stared through a window that showed only blackness.\n\n\"_Cold storage!_\" That was good work on Walt's part. He had been forced\nto shout the directions before them all, yet tell none of those others\nabout him where the ship was hidden. Chet was picturing that place of\n\"cold storage\" as he smiled. The fact that it was some thousands of\nmiles away troubled him not at all.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe great Hoover Terminal was a place where night never came. Its\ndaylight tubes wove a network of light about the stupendous enclosure,\ntheir almost silent hissing merged to an unceasing rush of sound, so\nsoft as to be unheard through the scuffing feet and chattering voices of\nthe ever-hurrying crowds.\n\nFrom subways the impatient people came and went, and from highway\nstations where busses and private cars drove in and away. The clock in\nthe squat tower swung its electrically driven hands toward the figure\n22; there lacked but two hours of midnight, and a steady stream of\naircraft came dropping down the shaft of green light that reached to and\nthrough the clouds. There would be many liners leaving on the hour;\nthese that were coming in were private craft that spun their flashing\nhelicopters like giant emeralds in the green descending light, while the\nnoise of their beating blades filled the air with a rush of sound.\n\nOutside the entrance to the Passenger Station, Chet Bullard withdrew\nhimself from the surging press of hurrying men and women and slipped\ninto a shadowed alcove. Two passing figures in the gray and gold of the\nAir Patrol scanned the crowd closely; Chet drew himself into the deeper\nshadows and waited until they were by before he emerged and followed\nthe shelter of a coffee-house that extended toward another entrance to\nthe field, where pilots and mechanics passed in and out.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA bulletin board showed in changing letters of light the official\nassignment of landing space. And, though every passing eye was turned\ntoward it, Chet knew that each man was intent upon the board and not on\nthe shadowed niche in the building behind it. He watched his chance and\nslipped into that shadow.\n\nUnseen, he could see them as they approached: men in the multicolored\nuniforms of many lines, who paused to read, to exchange bantering\nshop-talk--and to pass on.\n\nMany voices: \"Storm area, over the South-shore up to Level Six. You\nbirds on the local runs had better watch your step\" ... \"--coming down\nat Calcutta. Yeah, a dirty, red-bottomed freighter that rammed him. I\nsaw it take off two of his fans, but Shorty set the old girl down like a\nfeather on the lift of the four fans he had left. You said it--Shorty's\na real pilot....\"\n\nAnother pause; then a growling voice that proclaimed complainingly:\n\"Lord, but I'm tired! All right, Spud; grin, you damned Irishman! But if\nyou had been hauling the Commander all over Alaska to-day and then got\nordered out again just as you were set for a good sleep, you'd be sore.\nWhat in thunder does he want his ship for to-night, I ask you?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nChet, crouching still lower in the little retreat, stiffened to\nattention at the reference to the Commander. So the \"big boss\" had\nordered out his own cruiser again! He listened still more intently to\nthe voice that replied.\n\n\"Sure, and it's thankful you sh'u'd be to be holdin' the controls on a\nfine, big cruiser like that; though, betwixt you and me, 'tis myself\nthat don't envy you your job. Me and my old freighter, we go wallowin'\nalong. And to-night I'm takin' her home for repairs--back to the fact'ry\nin Rooshia where they made her; and the devil of a job it will be, for\nshe handles with all the grace of a pig in a puddle.\"\n\nChet risked a glance when the sound of heavy footsteps indicated that\none of the two speakers had gone on alone to the pilots' gate. Before\nthe huge bulletin board, in pilot's uniform and with the markings of a\nlow-level man on his sleeve, stood the sturdy figure of the man called\nSpud. He started back at sight of the face peering out at him, but Chet\nwhispered a command, and the man moved closer to the hiding place behind\nthe board.\n\nThere were others coming in a laughing group up the walk; daylight tubes\nilluminated the approach. Chet spoke hurriedly.\n\n\"I'm in a devil of a mess, Spud. Will you lend a hand? Will you stand by\nfor rescue work?\"\n\nAnd Spud studied the bulletin board as he growled:\n\n\"Lend a hand?--yes, and the arm with it, Mr. Bullard. You stud by me\nonce whin I needed help; and now you ask will I stand by for rescue\nwork. Till we crash--that's all, me bhoy!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSpud's speech was tinged with the brogue of Erin; it grew perceptibly\nmore pronounced as his quick emotions took hold of him.\n\n\"Quiet!\" said Chet. \"Wait till they pass!\"\n\nThe newcomers stopped for no more than a glance. Then:\n\n\"I'm demoted,\" Chet told the round-eyed man who stared unbelievingly at\nthe vacant place on Chet's blouse. \"The air's hot with orders for my\narrest. I've got to get out, and I've got to do it quick.\"\n\nAnd now there was only a trace of the brogue in Spud's voice. Chet knew\nthe trick of the man's speech; touch his heart and his tongue would grow\nthick; place him face to face with an emergency and he would go cold and\nhard, while the good-natured phrasing of his native sod went from him\nand he talked fast and straight.\n\n\"The devil you say!\" exclaimed Spud. \"What you've done I don't know, nor\nyet why you did it. But, whatever it was, I don't believe you let that\ntriple star go for less than a damned good reason. Now, let me think;\nlet--me--think--\"\n\nA figure in gray and gold was approaching, a member of the Air Patrol.\nSpud's tongue was lively with good-natured raillery as he fell into step\nand drew the officer with him through the pilots' gate, while Chet, from\nhis shadow, saw with satisfaction the apparent desertion. He had known\nSpud O'Malley of old. Spud was square--and Spud had wanted time for\nthinking.\n\nThere were many who passed Chet's hiding place before a cautious whisper\ncame to him and he saw a hand that thrust a roll of clothing around the\nedge of the bulletin board.\n\n\"Put 'em on!\" was the order of Spud. \"And smear your yellah hair with\nthe grease! Work fast, me bhoy!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe command was no less imperative for being spoken beneath Spud's\nbreath, and for the first time Chet's hopes soared high within him. It\nhad all been so hopeless, the prospect of actual escape from the net\nthat was closing about him. And now--!\n\nHe unrolled the tight package of cloth to find a small can of black\ngraphite lubricant done up in a jacket and blouse. Both were stained and\nsmeared with grease; they were amply large. Chet did not bother to strip\noff his own blouse; he pulled on the other clothes over his own, and his\nface was alight with a grin of appreciation of Spud's attention to\ndetails as he took a daub of the grease, rubbed it on his hands, then\npassed them through his hair.\n\n\"Yellah,\" Spud had said, but the description was no longer apt. And the\nman who stepped forth beside Spud O'Malley in the uniform of an engineer\nof a tramp freighter looked like nothing else in the world but just\nthat.\n\n\"Come on, now!\" ordered Spud harshly, as a figure in gray and gold\nappeared around the corner of the coffee shop. \"You're plinty late, me\nfine lad! Now get in there and clean up that dirty motor and get her\nrunnin'! Try out every fan on the old boat; then we'll be off.\n\n\"You're number CG41!\" he whispered. And Chet repeated the number as he\nfollowed the pilot through the gate.\n\n\"O.K.,\" said the guard at the gate, \"and I'll bet he gives you hell and\nto spare!\"\n\nChet slouched his shoulders to disguise his real height and followed\nwhere Spud O'Malley, with every indication of righteous anger, strode\nindignantly down the pavement, at the far end of which was a battered\nand service-stained ship.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHer hull of dirty red showed mottlings of brown; she was sadly in need\nof a painter's gun. She would groan and squeal, Chet knew, when the fans\nlifted her from the hold-down clutch; and she couldn't fly at over\ntwenty thousand without leaking her internal pressure through a thousand\ncracks that made her porous as an old balloon--but to Chet's eyes the\nold relic of the years was a thing of sheer beauty and grace.\n\nO'Malley was leading through an open freight hatch; Chet followed, and,\nat his beckoning hand, slipped into a dingy cabin.\n\n\"Lay low there,\" the pilot ordered, and still, as Chet observed, his\nspeech showed how clearly the man was thinking, since the emergency\nstill existed \"I've cleared some time ago, Mr. Bullard; we're ready to\nleave as soon as we get the dispatcher's O.K.\"\n\nThe minutes were long where Chet waited in the pilot's cabin. Each sound\nmight mean a last-minute search of departing ships, but he tried to tell\nhimself that the attention of the officers would be centered upon the\npassenger liners.\n\nBeyond, where he could see out into the control room, a white light\nflashed. He heard the bellowing orders of the Irishman at the controls.\nAnd, as other sounds reached his ears, he had to grip his hands hard\nwhile he fought for control of the laughter that was almost hysterical.\nFor, beneath him, he felt the sluggish lift of the ship, and, from every\njoint and plate of this old-timer of the air, came squawking protests\nagainst the cruel fates that drove her forth again to face the\nbuffeting, racking gales.\n\nBut the blue light of an ascending area was about them, and Spud\nO'Malley was shouting from the control room:\n\n\"Sure, and we're off, Mr. Bullard. Now do ye come up here and tell me\nall about it--but I warn you, I'll not be believin' a word--\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n_Up From Earth_\n\n\nChet had plenty of time in which to acquaint Pilot O'Malley with the\nfacts. And, when he had told his story, it did his sick and worried\nmind good to hear the explosive stream of expletives that came from the\nother's lips. Yet, despite the Irishman's anger, it was noticeable that\nhe closed the tight door of the control room before he said a word.\n\n\"Only a skeleton crew,\" he explained. \"Just the relief pilot and the\nengineers and a man or two in the galley, and I trust 'em all. But you\ncan't be too careful.\n\n\"The Commander,\" he concluded, \"is gettin' to be more an emperor than a\nCommander, and somethin's got to be done. Discipline we must have, 'tis\ntrue; but this kotowin' to His Royal Highness and all o' that--devil a\nbit do I like it! If only you could show him up, Mr. Bullard--but of\ncourse you can't.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure,\" Chet responded. \"What I told the big boss wasn't all\nbluff. Haldgren _did_ go out, five years ago this month. We have the\nrecord of a Crescent liner's captain who saw Haldgren's little ship\nshoot through the R.A. and go on out as if it were going somewhere. And\nnow we have these flashes!\n\n\"Do you see what that means, Spud? An SOS! Nobody but an Earth-man would\nsend that, and we wouldn't do it now. We would just press the lever of\nour emergency-call, and every receiver within a thousand miles would\npick up the scream of it.\n\n\"But we've had this Dunston Emergency Transmitter less than four years.\nHaldgren knew only the old S O S. And remember this: three dots, three\ndashes and three dots don't just happen. They showed up on the Moon.\nThey were repeated the next night. _Somebody sent them!_ Who was it?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd Pilot O'Malley gave the only obvious answer:\n\n\"There's only yourself and Mr. Harkness and Pilot Haldgren that could\nhave got there. 'Twas Haldgren, of course! What a pity that you can't\ngo; 'tis likely the poor bhoy needs help.\"\n\n\"Five years!\" mused Chet. \"Five long years since he left! He must have\nlanded safely--and then what? After five years comes a signal and that\nsignal a call for help that no pilot worthy the name would disregard....\n\n\"Where are we bound?\" he demanded abruptly.\n\n\"Rooshia,\" said O'Malley. \"I disremember the name--'tis on my\norders--but I know it's a long way up north.\"\n\n\"Spud,\" said Chet, \"you're a rotten pilot; you're one of the worst I\never knew. Careless--that's your worst fault--and if anybody doubts that\nthey'll believe it after this trip. For, Spud, if you're any friend of\nmine, and I know you are, you're going to lose your bearings, and kick\nthis old sky-hog a long way beyond that factory she is bound for. And\nyou're going to set me down in a God-forsaken spot in the arctic where\nI'm pretty sure I'll find a ship waiting for me.\n\n\"And, if you just stick around for a while after that, you will see me\ntake off for the Moon. Then, if Haldgren is there--\"\n\nChet failed to finish the sentence; he was staring through a rear\nlookout, where, over the arc of the Earth's horizon, could be seen a\nthin crescent Moon; about it drifting clouds made a halo.\n\nThe eyes of Spud O'Malley followed Chet's, and his imaginative faculties\nmust have been stimulated by Chet's words, for he gazed open-mouthed, as\nif for the first time he visioned that golden scimitar as something more\nsubstantial than a high-hung light. He drew one long incredulous breath\nbefore he answered.\n\n\"What position, sir? Say the word and I'll lose myself so bad we'll be\nover the Pole and half-way to the equator again!\"\n\n\"Not that bad,\" was Chet's assurance. \"Just spot this ship over 82:14\nnorth, 93:20 east, and I'll give you local bearings from there.\"\n\nThen to himself: \"'Cold storage,' Walt said; he meant our old shop, of\ncourse. Probably had a hunch we would need it.\"\n\nBut to the pilot he said only the one word: \"Thanks!\"--though the grip\nof his hand must have spoken more eloquently.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe eastbound lanes of the five thousand level saw them plod slowly\nalong, while faster and better-groomed ships slipped smoothly past; then\nthe red hull rose to Level Twelve and swung out upon the great circle\ncourse that would bear them more nearly in the direction of the\ndestination Chet had given. There were free levels higher up in which\nthey could have laid a direct course, but the Irish pilot did not need\nChet to tell him that the old hull would never stand it. Her internal\npressure could never have been maintained at any density such as human\nlungs demanded.\n\nBut they were on their way, and Chet's customary genial expression gave\nplace to one of more grim determination as he watched the white-flecked\nocean drift slowly past below.\n\nOnce a patrol ship spoke to them. Daylight had come to show plainly the\nsilver hull with the distinctive red markings of the Service that\nslipped smoothly down from above to hang poised under flashing fans like\na giant humming-bird. Her directed radio beam flashed the yellow call\nsignal in O'Malley's control room.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nChet was beside him, and the two exchanged silent glances before\nO'Malley cut in his transmitter. He must give name and number--this\nsignal was a demand that could not be disregarded--but on the old\nfreighter was no automatic sender that would flash the information\nacross to the other ship; the pilot's voice must serve instead.\n\n\"Number three--seven--G--four--two!\" he thundered into the radiophone.\n\"Freighter of the Intercolonial Line, without cargo--\"\n\n\"For the love of Pete,\" shouted the loudspeaker beside him in volume to\ndrown out the pilot's words, \"are you sending this by short wave, or are\nyou just yelling across to me? Calm down, you Irish terrier!\"\n\nThen, before the pilot could reply, the voice from the silver and red\npatrol ship dropped into an exaggerated mimicry of the O'Malley brogue--\n\n\"And did yez say 'twas a freighter you had there? Sure, I thot at th'\nvery last 'twas a foine big liner from the Orient and Transpolar run,\ndropped down here from the hoigh livils! All right, Spud; on your way!\nBut don't crowd the bottom of the Twelve Level so close. This is\nO--sixteen--L; Jimmy Maddux. By--by! I'll report you O.K.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAgain Chet looked at the pilot silently before he glanced back at the\nvanishing ship, already small in the distance. He repeated the Patrol\nCaptain's words:\n\n\"You will 'report us O.K.'--yes, Jimmy, you'll do that, and if they want\nto find us again you can tell them right where to look.\"\n\n\"I'm pushin' her all I can, Mr. Bullard,\" said Spud. \"'Tis all she can\ndo.... And now do ye go into my cabin--there's two berths there--and\nwe'll just turn in and sleep while my relief man takes his turn. But go\nin before I call him; there's not a soul on the ship besides ourselves\nknows that you're here.\"\n\nAnd, in the cabin a short time later, Pilot O'Malley chuckled as he\nwhispered: \"I gave the lad his course. And Mac will follow it, but it'll\nniver take him near to the part of Rooshia he expects it to. Still, the\nrecord's clear as far as he's concerned; I've got it in the log. Mac's a\ngood lad, and I wouldn't have him get into trouble over this.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the freighter's cabin the chronometer was again approaching the hour\nof twenty-two; for nearly twenty-four hours the ship had been on her\nplodding way. And, lacking the A.D.D.--the Automatic Destination\nDetector--and other refinements of instrumental installations of the\npassenger ships, Pilot O'Malley had to work out his position for\nhimself.\n\nAnd where a faster craft would have driven through with scarcely a\nquiver, the big ship trembled with the buffets and suction of a wintry\nblast that drove dry snow like sand across the lookout glasses. The\ntwelve thousand level was an unbroken cloud of snow--a gray smother\nwhere the red ship's blunt and rusty bow nosed through.\n\nO'Malley clung to the chart table as the air gave way beneath them and\nthe ship fell a hundred feet or more before her racing fans took hold\nand jerked her back to an even keel. He managed to check his figures,\nthen moved to the door of his cabin, opened it and called softly.\n\nChet was beside him in an instant. It had seemed best that he remain in\nhiding, and he knew what the pilot's call meant. \"Made it, did you!\" he\nexclaimed. \"Now I'll take a look about and pick up my bearing points.\"\n\nBut one look at the ports and he shook his head.\n\n\"That's dirty,\" he told O'Malley, and his eyes twinkled as he felt the\nold ship rear and plunge with the lift of a driving gale; \"and how the\nold girl does feel it! She can't rip through, and she can't go above.\nYou've had some trip, Spud; it's been mighty decent of you to go to all\nthis--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA flashing of yellow light on the instrument panel brought his thanks to\na sudden halt. A voice, startling in its sudden loudness, filled the\nlittle room.\n\n\"Calling three--seven--G--four--two! Stand by for orders! Patrol\nO--sixteen--L sending; acknowledge, please!\"\n\nChet's eyes were staring into those of O'Malley. \"That's Jimmy Maddux\nback on our trail,\" he said. \"Now, what has got them suspicious?\"\n\nHe glanced once at the collision instrument. \"He's right overhead at\nthirty thousand,\" he added; \"and there are more of them coming in from\nall sides. Now what the devil--\"\n\nSpud O'Malley had his hand on the voice switch. \"Be quiet!\" he\ncommanded; then spoke into the transmitter--\n\n\"Three--seven--G--four--two acknowledging!\" he said, and again Chet\nobserved how all trace of accent had departed from his voice; it was an\nindication of the moment's tenseness and of the pilot's full\nunderstanding of their position.\n\nThe answering order was crisply spoken; this was a different Jimmy\nMaddux from the one who had chaffed the Irish pilot some hours before.\n\n\"Stand by! We're coming down! Records at Hoover Terminal show two men\nreporting at pilots' gate under the number of your engineer, CG41. Hold\nyour ship exactly where you are; we're sending a man aboard!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nChet had moved silently to the controls. The old multiple-lever\ninstrument--he knew it well! But he looked at Spud O'Malley and waited\nfor his nod of assent before he presumed to trespass on another pilot's\ndomain. Then he shifted two little levers, and the ship fell away\nbeneath them as it plunged toward the Earth.\n\nAnd Pilot O'Malley was explaining to the Patrol Ship Captain as best he\ncould for the rolling plunge of the careening ship:\n\n\"I can't hold her, sir. And you'd best be keepin' away. It's stormin'\nfearful down here, and I can't rise above it! Keep clear!--I'm warnin'\nyou!\" The hum of their helicopters rose to a shrill whine as Chet drove\nthe ship out and down through the smothering clouds. \"You must hear her\nfans on your instruments; you can see how we're pitchin'!\"\n\nHe switched off the transmitter for a moment and faced Chet. \"They've\nbeen checkin' close,\" he stated. \"That was my engineer's number I gave\nyou as we came through the gate. And, of course, he had given it before\nwhen he reported in. Now we're up against it.\"\n\nThe collision instrument was humming with the sound of many motors, and\nwarning lights were giving their silent alarm of the oncoming ships.\n\n\"They're comin' in,\" Spud went on hopelessly, \"like a flock of kites in\nthe tropics when one of them's found somethin' dead--and it's us that's\nthe carcass!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut Chet was not listening. The snowy clouds had broken for an instant;\ntheir ship had driven through and beneath them. Through the wild,\nwhirling chaos of white there came for an instant a rift--and far across\nan icy expanse Chet glimpsed a range of black hills!\n\nHe spoke sharply to the pilot. \"That's Jimmy Maddux above us--kid him\nalong, Spud! Tell him we're coming up, don't let him grab us with his\nmagnets! This is putting you in a devil of a hole, old man. I'm\nsorry!--but we've got to see it through now.\n\n\"You can never set this ship down, Spud; that patrol would be on our\nbacks in half a second. And they'd knock me out with one shot the minute\nI stepped outside.\"\n\nThe clear space in the storm had filled again with the dirty gray of\nwind-whipped snow; off at the right a dim glow of distant fires was the\nmidnight sun as it shone for a brief moment. One blast, more malignant\nin its fury than those that had come before, tore first at the blunt\nbow, then caught them amidships to roll the big, sluggish freighter till\nher racked framework shrieked and chattered.\n\nSpud pointed through a rear lookout where a silvery Patrol Ship flashed\ndown through the clouds. \"There's Jimmy!\" he shouted. \"He's takin' no\nchances of our landing--he's right on our tail!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut Chet Bullard, his hands working at the control levers, was staring\nstraight ahead into that gray blast; and his eyes were shining as he\npulled back on a lever that threw them once more into the concealment of\nthe whirling clouds above.\n\n\"Spud,\" he was shouting, \"have you got a 'chute? You freighters have 'em\nsometimes. Get me a 'chute and I'll fool them yet! I saw the shed--our\nhangars--our work shop! There's where our ship is!\"\n\nThey were lost once more in the snow that seemed to be driving past in\nsolid drifts. Chet heard Spud shouting down a voice tube. And,\ncuriously, it was plain that the Irish pilot had lost all tenseness from\nhis voice; he was happy and as carefree as if he had found the answer\nto all his perplexing questions. He was calling an order to his relief\npilot.\n\n\"Mac--do ye break out two parachutes, me lad! Bring 'em up here, and\nshake a leg! No, there's nothin' to worry about--divil a thing!\"\n\nThen, into the transmitter, he shouted thickly as he switched the\ninstrument on:\n\n\"Jimmy, me bhoy, kape away! Kape away, I'm tellin' you, or ye'll have me\nIrish temper disturbed, and I'm a divil whin I'm roused! What do I know\nabout your twin ingineers? Wan of thim makes trouble enough for me! Now\ntake yourself away, and don't step on the tail of this ship or we'll go\ndown to glory together!--unless we go to another terminal and find\noursilves in hell, and us all covered wid snow. Think how divilish\nconspicuous you'd be feelin'--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA discord of voices silenced his laughing banter; on the instrument\nboard the warning light was flashing imperatively. Above the bedlam of\nvoices one stood out, and all other commands went silent before the\nvoice of authority.\n\n\"Silence! This is the Commander of Air! Orders for O--sixteen--L: seize\nthat ship! Your magnets!--disregard damage!--get your magnets on that\nship and hold her. We are coming down--\"\n\nChet reached for the transmitter switch and opened it that their voices\nmight not go beyond the control room.\n\n\"Lots of company; they seem pretty certain that they're on the right\ntrack. And the big boss himself is coming down to call. Can't you hurry\nthose 'chutes?\"\n\nThe control room door was flung open as the figure of a young man\nstumbled through and dropped two bundles of cloth and webbing upon the\nfloor. He clung to the door-frame as Chet threw the big freighter into\na totally unexpected maneuver that rolled them down and away from a\nsilver-bellied ship above. Then the levers moved again, and the ship\nwent hard-a-port as Chet caught again one fleeting glimpse of shadow\nbelow that could only be the markings of a building he had known well.\n\n\"Hold her there, Spud!\" he shouted. \"He'll be back in a minute or two!\nHe'll get us next time!\"\n\nChet was reaching for the straps of a 'chute. He had the webbing about\nhim when he stopped to waste precious seconds in wide-eyed staring at\nthe figure of Spud O'Malley.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSpud was pulling at a recalcitrant buckle. He had motioned the relief\npilot to take the controls, and now the bulk of a parachute pack hung\nawkwardly behind him.\n\n\"Spud!\" Chet shouted. \"You're not stepping out too! It's no sure thing\nwith these old 'chutes; they're probably rotten! Stay here! Tell 'em I\nstuck you up with a gun!--tell 'em I made you bring me--\"\n\n\"If you must talk,\" said Spud O'Malley calmly, and pulled a strap tight\nacross his chest, \"do ye be tryin to work while you talk. Get that\nharness on! If I let you stow away on my ship you can do no less than\ntake me along on yours!\"\n\nA crashing impact drove the men to the floor in a sprawling heap; Chet\npulled the last strap tight as he lay there. The lookouts were black\nabove where the belly of a Patrol Ship clung close.\n\n\"Jimmy knows how to obey orders,\" said Chet as he came to his feet. \"No\ncable magnets for Jimmy! He just smashed down on top of us, ripped off\nour fans and grabbed hold.\" He was helping Spud to his feet as he spoke.\n\n\"Mac, me bhoy,\" the pilot told his assistant, \"the log has it all, the\nwhole story. There'll be no trouble for you at all.\"\n\nHe yanked quickly at the port-opening switch, and the big steel disk\nbacked slowly out of its threaded seat and swung wide.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nChet drew back one involuntary step as a blast of icy wind drove\nstinging snow into his face. Then, without a word, he gave Spud O'Malley\na joyous grin and threw himself out into the void....\n\nAnd, later, as he released the 'chute where a wind was dragging him\nviolently across an icy expanse, he was laughing exultantly to see\nanother 'chute whirled into the enshrouding drifts, while the chunky\nfigure of a man came scrambling to his feet that he might shake a fist\ninto the air toward some hidden enemy and shout into the storm epithets\nonly half-heard.\n\n\"--and be damned to ye!\" Chet heard him conclude; then was close enough\nto throw one arm about the figure and draw him after where he made his\nway toward a building that was like a mountain of snow.\n\nSpud must have marveled at the craft within; at her sleek, shining\nsides; the flat nose that ended in a black exhaust port. He was\nexamining the other exhausts that ringed her round when Chet pulled out\na lever from the streamlined surface and swung open an entrance port.\n\nHe motioned Spud into the brilliantly lighted interior, where nitron\nilluminators were almost blinding as they shone of gleaming levers and\ndials of a control room like none that Spud O'Malley had ever seen.\n\nChet had thrown the building's doors open wide; a whirling motor had\ndrawn them back on hidden tracks. Now he closed the entrance port with\ncare, then glanced at his instruments before he placed his hand on a\nmetal ball.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt hung suspended in air within a cage of curved bars. It was a\nmodification of the high-liner ball-control, and it was new. Walt\nHarkness had had it installed to replace a more crudely fashioned\nsubstitute that had brought them safely back from the Dark Moon. The\nname of that new satellite was on Chet's lips as his thin hand rested\ndelicately upon the ball.\n\n\"It's not the Dark Moon this time, old girl,\" he told the ship, \"though\nyou've taken me there twice. But we're going up just the same, and I\ntold the Commander he hasn't Patrol Ships enough to hold us back.\" His\nfingers were gripping the little ball--lifting it--moving it forward....\n\nAnd, as if he lifted the ship itself, the silent cylinder came roaring\ninto life. Within the great building was a thundering blast that made\nthe voice of the storm less than a whispering breath. It came but\nfaintly through the heavily insulated walls, but Chet felt the lift of\nthe ship, and that joyous smile was crinkling about his eyes as the\nsilvery cylinder floated smoothly out of her shelter into the grip of\nthe wind.\n\nHis eyes were on an upper lookout, where clouds were driving away like a\ncurtain unrolled. More cloud banks were coming, but, for a time, the\nheavens were clear where the great red hull of a rusty freighter hung\nhelpless beneath a red and silver Patrol Ship whose magnets held fast to\nits prey.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were other shapes in the markings of the Service that shot\nslantingly down. Chet thought again of the carrion birds; then he saw\nthe gold star on the bow of a great cruiser and knew from that ship that\nthe Commander must be seeing their own below. Then he eased gently\nforward on a tiny ball--forward and forward, while the compensating\nfloor of the control room swung up behind them and seemed thrusting up\nwith unbearable weight.\n\nThere were flashes from the cruisers above, and flashes of red on the\nice behind with fountains of shattered ice and rock; detonite works its\nmost terrible destruction on a surface that is brittle and hard. But of\nwhat avail are detonite shells against a craft whose speed builds up to\nsomething greater than the muzzle velocity of a shell?--a silvery craft\nthat sweeps out and out toward a black mountain range; then swings\nslowly up in a curve of sheer beauty that bends into banked masses of\nclouds--and ends.\n\nBut within the control room, Chet Bullard, no longer Master Pilot of the\nWorld, but master, in all truth, of space, knew that his ship's flight\nwas far from ending. He turned to grin happily at his companion.\n\n\"We're off!\" he shouted. \"And it's thanks to you that we made it. If\nHaldgren's alive he'll have you to thank; for it's you that has done the\ntrick so far!\"\n\nBut Spud O'Malley answered soberly as he stared up and out into the\nblackness of levels he had never seen.\n\n\"I've helped,\" he admitted; \"I've helped a bit. But it's a divil of a\njob of navigatin' that's ahead. And that's up to you, Chet Bullard; 'tis\nno job for an old omadhaun like mesilf!\"\n\nChet felt the lift of the Repelling Area as they shot through. Ahead was\nthe black velvet night that he knew so well; its silent emptiness was\npricked through with bright points of fire.\n\n\"I found the Dark Moon,\" he said slowly, \"and that you can't see at all.\nThis other will be easy.\"\n\nThere was no boastfulness in the tone, and Spud O'Malley nodded as he\nglanced respectfully at the young man who threw back his disheveled mop\nof hair from a lean face and marked down some cryptic figures on a\nrecord sheet.\n\nChet Bullard was on the job ... and his passenger, it would seem, was\nsatisfied that his unbelievable adventure was well begun.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n_Life Monstrous and Horrible_\n\n\n\"It looks,\" said Spud O'Malley, \"as if some bad little spalpeen of the\nskies had thrown pebbles at it when 'twas soft. It's fair pockmarked\nwith places where the stones have hit.\"\n\nHe was staring through a forward lookout, where the whole sky seemed\nfilled with a tremendous disk. One quarter was brilliantly alight; it\nformed a fat crescent within whose arms the rest of the globe was held\nin fainter glowing. By comparison, this greater portion was dark, though\nilluminated by earthlight far brighter than any moonlight on Earth.\n\nBut light or dark, the surface showed nothing but an appalling\ndesolation where the rocky expanse had been still further torn and\ndisrupted--pockmarked, as O'Malley had said, with great rings that had\nbeen the walls of tremendous volcanoes.\n\nChet was consulting a map where a similar area of circular markings had\nbeen named by scientists of an earlier day.\n\n\"Hercules,\" he mused, and stared out at the great circle of the moon.\n\"The crater of Hercules! Yes, that must be it. That dark area off to one\nside is the Lake of Dreams; below it is the Lake of Death. Atlas!\nHercules! Suffering cats, what volcanoes they must have been!\"\n\n\"I don't like your names,\" objected O'Malley. \"Lake of Death! That's\nnot so good. And I don't see any lake, and the whole Moon is wrong side\nup, according to your map.\"\n\nChet reached for the ball-control, moved it, and swung their ship in a\nslow, rotary motion. The result was an apparent revolution of the Moon.\n\n\"There, it's right side up,\" Chet laughed; \"that is, if you can tell me\nwhat direction is 'up' out here in space. And, as for the names, don't\nlet them disturb you; they don't mean anything. Some old-timer with a\nlittle three-inch telescope probably named them. The darker areas looked\nlike seas to them. Astronomers have known better for a long time; and\nyou and I--we're darned sure of it now.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe great sea of shadow, a darker area within the shaded portion whose\nonly light came from the Earth, was plainly a vast expanse of blackened\nrock. An immense depression, like the bottom of some earlier sea, it was\nheaved into corrugations that Chet knew would be mountain-high at close\nrange. Marked with the orifices of what once had been volcanoes, the\nfloor of that Lake of Death was hundreds of miles in extent.\n\nBut as for seas and lakes, there was no sign of water in the whole,\nvast, desolate globe. An unlikely place, Chet admitted, for the\nbeginning of their search, and yet--those flashes of light!--the S O S!\nThey had been real!\n\nThe bow blast had been roaring for over an hour; their strong\ndeceleration made the forward part of the ship seem \"down.\" And down it\nwas, too, by reason of the pull of the great globe they were\napproaching. But the roaring exhaust up ahead was checking their speed;\nChet measured and timed the apparent growth of the Moon-disk and nodded\nhis satisfaction at their reduced speed.\n\n\"This will stop us,\" he said. \"I didn't know but we would have to swing\noff, shoot past, and return under control. But we're all right, and\nthere is the place we are looking for--the big ring of Hercules, the\nlevel floor of rock inside it. And over at one side the smaller\ncrater--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was gazing entranced at the mammoth circle that had been a volcano's\nthroat--the very one he had seen flashed on the screen. He moved the\ncontrol to open a side exhaust and change their direction of fall. He\nwas still staring, with emotions too overwhelming for words, and Spud\nO'Malley was silent beside him, as the great ring spread out and became\nan up-thrust circle of torn, jagged mountains some thirty or more miles\nacross and directly below.\n\nThey fell softly into that circle. Its mountainous sides were high; they\nblocked off the view of the enormous terraces beyond that had been the\ncrater's sloping sides.\n\nFrom the direction that had suddenly become \"east,\" the rising sun's\nstrong light struck in a slant to make the bar rocks seem incandescent.\nOn one side the giant rim of the encircling mountains was black with\nshadow. The shadow reached out across the vast, rocky floor almost to\nthe foot of the opposite wall many miles away. It enveloped their\nfalling ship like a cushioning, ethereal sea: velvety, softly black,\nalmost palpable.\n\nIt was wrapping them about in the darkness of night as Chet's slender\nhand touched so delicately upon the ball-control--checked them, eased\noff, drew back again until the thundering exhausts echoed softly where\ntheir ship hung suspended a hundred feet above a rocky floor. The\nshrouding darkness erased the harsh contours of mountain and plain; it\nseemed shielding this place of desolation and horror from critical,\nperhaps unfriendly eyes of these beings from another world. And Chet\nlaid their ship down gently and silently on the earthlit plain as if he,\ntoo, felt this sense of intrusion--as if there might be those who would\nresent the trespass of unwanted guests.\n\nBut Spud O'Malley must have experienced no such delicacy of feeling. He\nlet go one long pent-up breath.\n\n\"And may the saints protect us!\" he said. \"The Lake of Death outside,\nand inside here is purgatory itself, or I don't know my geography. But\nyou made it, Chet, me bhoy; you made it! What a sweet little pilot you\nare!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"There's air here,\" Chet was telling his companion later; \"air of a\nsort, but it's no good to us.\"\n\nHe pointed to the spectro-analyzer with its groupings of lines and light\nbands. \"Carbon dioxide,\" he explained, \"and some nitrogen, but mighty\nlittle of either. See the pressure gage; it's way down.\n\n\"But that won't bother us too much. We've got some suits stowed away in\nthe supplies that will hold an atmosphere of pressure, and their oxygen\ntanks will do the rest. We were ready for anything we might find on our\nDark Moon trip, but we didn't need them there. Now they'll come in\nhandy.\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" O'Malley assured him; \"I've gone down under water in\na diving suit; I've gone outside a ship for emergency repairs in a suit\nlike yours when the air was as thin as this; I can stand it either way.\nBut what I want to know is this:\n\n\"What the divil chance is there of findin' your man, Haldgren, in such\na frozen corner of purgatory as this? How could he live here? Here\nyou've come in a fine, big ship, and his was a little bit of a bullet by\ncomparison. Yet I doubt if you could live here for five years with all\nyour big oxygen supply. Now, how could he have done it with his little\noutfit?\n\n\"And what has he eaten? Does this look like a likely place for shootin'\nrabbits, I ask you? Can a man catch a mess of fish in that empty Lake of\nDeath? Or did Haldgren bring a sandwich with him, it may be?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nChet Bullard shook his head doubtfully.\n\n\"Don't get sarcastic!\" he grinned. \"You can't think of any wilder\nquestions than I have asked myself.\n\n\"He couldn't have lived here, Spud; that's the only answer. It just\nisn't humanly possible. All I know is that he did it. I can't tell you\nhow I know it, but I do. Those lights were a human call for help. No\nliving man but Haldgren could have flashed them. He's alive--or he was\nthen; that's all I know.\"\n\nSpud crossed the control room as he had done a score of times to look\nthrough a glass port at the world outside. Chet, too, turned to the\nlookout by which he stood and stared through it. The men had found\nthemselves surprisingly light within the ship. They had been compelled\nto guard against sudden motion; a step, instead of carrying them one\nstride, might hurl them the length of the room. This lowered\ngravitational pull helped to explain to the pilot that outer world.\n\nThere, close by, was the rocky plain on which he had landed the ship:\nSmooth and shiny as obsidian in places, again it was spongy gray, the\ncolor of volcanic rock, bubbling with imprisoned gases at the instant\nof hardening. It stretched out and down, that gently rolling plain, for\na thousand yards or more, then ended in a welter of nightmare forms done\nin stone. It was like the work of some demented sculptor's tortured\nbrain.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJutting tongues of rock stood in air for a hundred--two hundred--feet.\nChet hardly dared estimate size in this place where all was so strange\nand unearthly. The hot rock had spouted high in the thin air, and it had\nfrozen as it threw itself frantically out from the inferno of heat that\nhad given it birth. The jets sprayed out like spume-topped waves; they\nwere whipped into ribbons that the winds of this world could not tear\ndown, and the ribbons shone, waving white in the earthlight. The\ntortured stone was torn and ripped into twisted contortions whose very\nwrithing told of the hell this had been. Its grotesque horror struck\nthrough to the deeper levels of Chet's mind with a feeling he could not\nhave depicted in words.\n\nFrom the higher elevation where their ship lay he could look out and\nacross this welter of storm-lashed rock to see it level off, then vanish\nwhere another crater mouth yawned black. Here was the inner crater! It\nhad seemed small before; it was huge now--a place of mystery, a black,\nwaiting throat into which Chet knew he must go--a place of indefinable\nterror.\n\nBut it was the place, too, whence strange flashes had come, flashes that\nhad told of the distress and suffering of men since the time when\nwireless waves had been widely used. The old call--the S O S!--it had\ncome from that throat; it had seemed a call sent directly to him! And\nChet Bullard's eyes held steadily toward that place of mystery and of a\nsender unknown.\n\n\"I'm going down,\" he told himself more than O'Malley. \"There's something\nabout it I can't understand, something pretty damnable about it, I\nadmit. But, whatever it is, that's what I am here to find out.\"\n\n\"'Tis a divil of a place to die,\" said O'Malley, \"and not one I'd pick\nout at all. But it may be we won't have to. I'm goin' along, of course.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe master pilot was reaching for the flexible metal suit he had brought\nfrom the store room. It was air-tight, gas-proof; it would hold an\ninternal pressure far beyond anything the wearer would demand; and its\nheadpiece was flexible like the body of the suit, and would fit him\nclosely.\n\nHe drew the suit up over the clothes he wore and closed the front with\none pull of a metal tab. Within, soft rubber-faced cushions had\ninterlocked; the body would fasten to the headpiece in the same way. But\nChet paused with the headpiece in his hand.\n\nHe looked at the glass window that would be before his eyes; at the thin\ndiaphragms that would come over his ears and that would admit all\nordinary sounds; and he tried out the microphone attachment that he\ncould switch on to bring to his ears the faintest whisper from outside.\nAll this he examined with care while he seemed to be thinking deeply.\nThen he straightened and looked at his companion.\n\n\"No, Spud, you're not going,\" he said. \"This is my job. You'll stay with\nthe ship. You and I make a rather small army: we don't know yet what we\nmay be up against, and we mustn't risk all our forces in one advance.\nI'll see what is there; and, in case anything happens, you can take the\nship back. I've taught you enough on the way over; I had this very\nthing in mind.\"\n\nHe slipped the helmet over his blond head before O'Malley could reply.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe ear-pieces and the microphone allowed him to hear. Another diaphragm\nin the center of the metal across his chest took his own voice and\nshouted it into the room.\n\n\"Sure, I know you want to go. Spud; but you'll have to stay in reserve.\nNow show me how well you can fly the ship. Lift her off; then drift over\nthat crater, and we'll have a look-see!\"\n\nSpud O'Malley's face was glum as he obeyed. Spud had seen nothing but\ndeath in this place of horror--Chet had observed that plainly--yet it\nwas equally plain that the Irish pilot was finding the order to live in\nsafety a bitter dose. But Spud knew how to take orders; he lifted the\nlittle ball gently and swung the ship out toward the blackness of that\ndeeper pit.\n\nChet was watching the changing terrain. He saw the place of\nsolid-spouted rock end; saw it flatten out to an undulating surface that\nhad rolled and heaved itself into many-colored shapes. Even in the\nearthlight the kaleidoscopic colors were vivid in their changing reds\nand blues and yellow sheens. Then this surface sloped sharply away,\nthough here it was rough with broken rock where half-hardened lava,\ncoughed from that throat, had fallen back and adhered to the molten\nsides.\n\nThis rock in the inner crater was gray, pale and ghostly in the\nearthlight. It went down and still down where Chet's eyes could not\nfollow--down to an utter blackness. Chet was staring speculatively at\nthat waiting dark when the first flash came.\n\nBlindingly keen! A flash of white light!--another and another! It\nblazed dazzlingly into their cabin in vivid dashes and dots--the same\nsignal as before was being repeated!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA hundred yards away was a little shelf of rock. Chet jerked at\nO'Malley's shoulder with his metal-cased hand and pointed. \"Set her\ndown!\" he ordered \"Let me out there! We can't put the ship down where\nthose lights are; the throat is too narrow; there may be air-currents\nthat would smash us on a sharp rock. I'll go down! You wait! I'll be\nback.\"\n\nHe was opening the inner door of the entrance port. Another closure in\nthe outer shell made an air-lock. He took time for one grip at the hand\nof Spud O'Malley, one grin of excited, adventurous joy that wrinkled\nabout his eyes behind the window of his helmet--then he picked up a\ndetonite pistol, examined again its charge of tiny shells, jammed it\nfirmly into the holster at his waist and swung the big door shut behind\nhim.\n\nAnd Pilot O'Malley watched him go with a premonition that he dared not\nspeak. He heard the closing of the outer door; saw the tall, slender\nfigure in a metal suit like a knight of old as Chet waved once, settled\nthe oxygen tank across his shoulders and picked his way carefully over a\nwaste of shattered stone that led down and down into the dark.\n\nThen the Irishman looked once at the suit he had expected to wear,\nstared back where the figure of Chet had vanished, then dropped his head\nupon his hands while his homely face was twisted convulsively.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt had come so soon! The great adventure was upon them before he had\nrealized. The reconnaissance--the flashes--and then Chet had gone! And\nnow he was alone in a silent ship that rested quietly in this soundless\nworld. The silence was heavy upon him; it seemed pressing in with actual\nweight to bear him down. It was shattered at the last by the faintest of\nwhispered echoes from without.\n\nSpud was on his feet in an instant, his eyes straining at one lookout\nafter another, each giving him a view of only the desolation he knew and\nhated.\n\nWhat could it have been? he demanded. He found and rejected a dozen\nanswers before he saw, far down in the black crater-mouth, a flash of\nred; then heard again that ghost of a sound and knew it for what it was.\n\nThick walls, these of the space ship, and insulated well; and the thin\natmosphere of this wild world could cut a blast of sound to a mere\nfraction of its volume! But the walls were admitting a fragmental echo\nof what must have been a reverberating voice. They were quivering to the\nroar of exploding detonite!\n\nIt was Chet! He was fighting, he was in trouble! Spud's trembling hands\nsteadied upon the metal control; he lifted the ship as smoothly as even\nChet might have done, and he drove it out and down into a throat too\nnarrow for safety, but where the tiny, red flash of a weapon had called\nwith an S O S as plain as any lettered call--a message to which brave\nmen have everywhere responded.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe saw Chet but once. The master pilot had shown him the flare release\nlever; he moved it now, and the place of darkness was suddenly blinding\nwith light. There were rocks close at hand; the crater had narrowed to a\nfunnel throat that was cut and terraced as if by human hands. Below, it\nended in a smooth stone floor where the lava had sealed it shut.\n\nFrom a terrace came the gleaming reflection of Chet's suit. Miraculously\nthe gleam was doubled, as if another in similar garb stood at his side.\nAnd beyond, from blocks of stone, came leaping things--living creatures!\n\nThe light died. Spud realized he had not opened the release lever full.\nHe fumbled for it--found it, jammed it over! And in the light that\nfollowed he saw only empty, terraced walls where nothing moved, and a\nlava floor below that, for an instant, gaped open, then again was smooth\nand firm.\n\nAnd the thunder of his ship's exhausts came back to him from those\nthreatening walls to tell of a loneliness more certain and terrible than\nany solitude he had found in the silence where he had waited above.\n\nBut through all his dismay ran an undercurrent of puzzled wonderment.\nFor here on a dead world, where all men agreed there could be no life,\nhe had seen the impossible.\n\nOnly one glimpse before the light had died; only for an instant had he\nseen the things that leaped upon Chet--but he knew! Never again could\nany man tell Spud O'Malley that the Moon was a lifeless globe ... and he\nknew that the life was of a form monstrous and horrible and malign!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n_\"And I've Brought You to This!\"_\n\n\nThe master pilot, when he stepped forth upon that weird globe which was\nthe Moon, found himself plunged into a spectral world. Even from within\nthe air-tight suit, through whose helmet-glass he peered, he sensed, as\nhe had not when inside the ship, the vast desolation, the frozen\nemptiness of this rocky waste.\n\nHis suit of woven metal was lined throughout with heavy fabric of\ninsuline fibers, that strange product brought from the jungle heat of\nthe upper Amazon to keep out the bitter cold of this frozen world. His\nship was felted with the same material between its double walls; without\nit there would have been no resisting the cold of these interstellar\nreaches.\n\nBut, despite the padding within his suit, he felt the numbing cold of\nthis dead world strike through. And the bleak and frigid barrenness that\nmet his gaze was so implacably hostile to any living thing as to bring a\nshudder of more than physical cold.\n\nNo warming sun, as yet, reflected from the rocks. About him was the\nblackness of a fire-formed lithosphere, whose lighter veining and\noccasional ashy fields were made ghostly in the earthlight.\n\nOne slow, all-seeing glance at this!--one moment of wondering amazement\nwhen he tilted his head far back that he might look up to the mouth of\nthe crater and see, in a dead-black sky, the great crescent of earth--a\nvast, incredible moon peeping over the serrate edge. Then, as if the\ninterval of time since leaving the ship had been measured in hours\ninstead of brief seconds, he remembered the flashing lights that had\nsignaled from below.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis first step carried him, slipping and sprawling awkwardly, across a\nrocky slope white with the rime of carbon dioxide frost. He came to his\nfeet and turned once to wave toward the ship where he knew Spud O'Malley\nmust be watching from a lookout. Then, moving cautiously, to learn the\ngage of his own strength in this world of diminished weights, he started\ndown.\n\nRough going, Chet found; the wall of this great throat had not hardened\nwithout showing signs of its tortured coughing. But Chet learned to\njudge distance, and he found that a fifty-foot chasm was a trifle to be\ncrossed in one leap; huge boulders, whose molten sides had frozen as\nthey ran and dripped, could be surmounted by the spring of his leg\nmuscles that could throw him incredibly through the air. And always he\nwent downward toward the place where the lights had flashed.\n\nThey came once more. He had descended a thousand feet, he was\nestimating, when the black igneous rocks blazed blindingly with a\nreflected light like that of a thousand suns.\n\nAnother hundred feet below, down a precipitous slope, was a broad table\nof rock. He saw it in the instant before he threw one metal-clad arm\nacross the eye-piece of his helmet to shut out the glare. And he saw, in\nthat fraction of a second, a moving figure, another like himself, clad\nin an armored suit whose curves and fine-woven mesh caught the light in\na million of sparkling flames.\n\nIt was Haldgren, he told himself; and there was something that came\nchokingly into his throat at the thought. That lonely figure--one tiny\ndot of life on a bleak and lifeless stage! It was pitiful, this undying\neffort to signal, to let his own world know that he still lived.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nChet did not put it into coherent words, but there was an overwhelming\nemotion that was part pity and part pride. He was suddenly glad and\nthankful to belong to a race of men who could carry on like this--who\nnever said die. And, as the glare winked out, he threw himself\nrecklessly down that last slope and brought up in a huddle at the feet\nof the one who had started back in affright. There was one metal-cased\nhand that went in a helpless gesture to the throat; the figure, all\nsilvery white in the dim Earth-glow, staggered back against a wall of\nrock; only by inches did it miss a fall from the precipice edge where\nthe rock platform ended.\n\nFrom the floor, where his fall had flung him in awkward posture, Chet\nsaw this; saw it and marveled vaguely. What picture he had formed of\nHaldgren--what he had expected of him--he could not have told. Certainly\nit was not this slenderly youthful figure, nor this reaction that was\nmore of fright than startled amazement. And the voice! Surely he had\nheard an involuntary, half-stifled scream!\n\nHe came slowly to his feet. And he was wondering now if his deductions\nhad been wrong. He had been to sure that the sender of those messages\nwas an Earth-man; he had been so certain of finding Haldgren.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSlowly he crossed the table of rock toward the waiting figure; gently he\nextended his hands, palms upward, in a gesture of peaceful promise.\nWhoever, whatever this was--this Moon-being who had signaled and in\ndoing so had happened upon the letters that had a definite meaning of\nEarth--Chet knew he must not frighten him. One outstretched hand touched\nthe metal that cased an arm; moved upward to the headpiece, as\nclose-fitting as his own; tilted it that the light of Earth might shine\nwithin and show him what manner of being he had found.\n\nAnd Chet, who had seen strange creatures on that Dark Moon where he and\nHarkness had explored, was prepared, despite the suit so like his own,\nto see some weird being of this newer world. But for what the soft light\nof that distant Earth disclosed he was entirely unprepared.\n\nEyes, blue and lovely as an azure sea but wide with terror and dismay;\neyes that showed plainly a consternation of unbelief that changed\nslowly, as the blue eyes stared into Chet's gray ones, until they were\nsuddenly misty with tears; and the figure sagged and would have dropped\nat his feet had he not caught it in his arms.\n\nHe heard his own voice exclaiming in wonderment: \"A girl! One of our own\nkind! Out here! On the Moon!\"\n\nAnd another voice, sweetly tremulous, replied:\n\n\"Oh, it's true--it's true! You have come! You read my call! Oh, I hardly\ndared hope--\"\n\nThen the thrilling ecstasy of happiness in the voice gave place to\naccents of dismay as some horror of fear swept in upon her.\n\n\"And I've brought you to this! You will be lost! Quick! Climb for your\nlife! I will come after. Quick! Quick!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was agony in the voice now, and the figure wrenched itself from\nChet's arms to point one slender hand upward in frantic urging, while\nyet the head turned that the eyes might look backward as if some danger\nthreatened from below.\n\n\"I've got a ship,\" Chet assured her. \"God knows who you are or how you\ngot here, but it's all right now. We'll leave.\"\n\nHe had regained his grip upon one of those slender hands and was\npreparing to swing her up to the top of an incredibly high rock. Her\nscream checked him and sent his one free hand to the detonite pistol at\nhis waist.\n\n\"Behind you!\" she cried. \"Look back! They have come out!\"\n\nThe crater-pit behind and below them was black with the inky blackness\nof smooth, fire-formed rock. Its many facets were smooth and polished;\nthey made mirrors, many of them, for the earthlight reflected from the\ncrater mouth. They served to diffuse this dim light and throw it again\nupon the monstrous blacknesses that were swarming from below.\n\n\"Men!\" thought Chef in one instant of half-comprehension. Then, as he\nsaw the chalk-white bodies, the dead and flabby whiteness of their faces\nfrom which red eyes stared, he revised his estimate; here was nothing\nhuman.\n\nThe pistol was in his hand, but as yet he had not fired. Only the terror\nin the girl's voice had told him that these were enemies; he waited for\na closer view or for some direct attack, and needed to wait but a\nmoment.\n\nOnly an instant after he had seen, the chalk-white bodies clustered\nbelow were in motion. They came leaping up the smooth expanses of rock,\nand they were obscured at times as if by black curtains that were drawn\nacross their bodies. Then they would flash out again in dead-white\nnakedness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was uncanny. Chet had a feeling that they were wrapping themselves in\nblack invisibility. Only when a score of the white things threw\nthemselves out into space did he know the truth.\n\nOut and upward they sprang, to soar above Chet's head and land on the\nslope above. All escape was cut off now; but it was not this thought\nthat held Chet motionless for that moment of horror. It was the glimpse\nhe had had against the light of the crater mouth of beating, flailing\nwings that whipped the thin air above him; of curved claws; and of long,\nhorrible tails that might have belonged to giant rats. And the demoniac\ncries that the thin air brought him were no more suggestive of devils\nunleashed than were the leathery wings and the fleshy tails of the\nbeasts.\n\nYet it was not this alone that stunned the mind of the master pilot, but\nthe horrible incongruity, of this monstrous inhumanness allied with the\nhuman form of their bodies. And throughout he observed, with a curious\nsense of detachment, the furious beating of the wings, almost useless in\nthe thin air, and the expansion and contraction of sac-like membranes on\neach side of the necks which he took to be auxiliary lungs.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was the girl's action that brought Chet to his senses. She moved\nslowly across the smooth table of rock toward the three or four beasts\nwho had gained its level. Her head was bowed in utter dejection; Chet\nsensed it as plainly as if she had spoken. She held out her hands\nhelplessly toward the creatures--and in that instant Chet's pistol\nspoke.\n\nTiny shells, those of a detonite pistol, and the grain of explosive in\nthe tip of each bullet is microscopic. But no body, human or inhuman, be\nit made of flesh, can withstand the shattering concussion of that\nexploding shell.\n\nThe beasts beside that figure, slenderly girlish even in its metal\nsheath, fell into the pit beyond; their screams rang horribly as they\nfell. There were others who took their places, and they, too, vanished\nunder the smashing shots.\n\nAnd then, after timeless moments of waiting, while the only sound was\nthe half-audible voice of the girl who sobbed: \"Now you are surely lost.\nThey will kill you--you should not have fired--I should never have\nbrought you here\"--there came the familiar thunder of a ship's exhausts.\n\nDown from above, a black shadow came silently crashing; a blaze of light\nterrific in its brilliance brought an exclamation to Chet's lips and\nhope to his heart.\n\n\"Spud! You old fool, you're coming to get us!\"\n\nBut the words ended with an avalanche of bodies that threw themselves\ndown the black slope. There were others coming from below, leaping from\nthe stones. The ledge was filled with them.\n\nChet was firing blindly as he felt himself borne down--felt long fingers\nthat ripped, then closed about his throat and jammed the metal of his\nsuit in chokingly. He heard the beating of giant wings about him; felt\nhimself half-carried and half-thrown toward a floor of rock far below.\n\nThere was an opening that loomed blackly in that floor; one glimpse of\nhis surroundings Chet had before the press of bodies closed him in. They\nwere forcing the shining, silvery figure of a girl into that black\nopening--dropping her! Then he felt himself hurled into the same void,\nwhile above him a ship of space thundered vainly from her great exhausts\nas if roaring in rage at her own futility.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n_Heart of the Moon_\n\n\nIn the grasp of the winged creatures' long, clawed hands Chet was\nhelpless. He was struggling vainly when they released their hold and he\nfelt himself falling into a pit that, as far as he knew, was a\nbottomless abyss. He was still struggling to right himself in mid-air\nwhen he struck.\n\nTo fall even so short a distance on Earth would have meant instant\ndeath. Here, where gravitation's pull was but one-sixth that of Earth,\nhe still struck on a rocky floor with a thud that made him sick for lack\nof breath.\n\nAbove him was a pale circle of light. Tipping the edge of a vast crater\nmouth high above was a rim of brilliance. Earthlight! Chet was suddenly\ncertain that he was seeing that glow for the last time as the circle\nwent black, and there came to him the unmistakable clang of metal where\na door was shut.\n\nThrough the countless mingled emotions that filled him he was wondering\nwhat manner of creatures these were into whose hands he had fallen.\nIntelligent, beyond a doubt, in their own way; he could not question the\nevidence of his own eyes and ears. They were able to work in metals and\nto seal the mouth of this lunar tomb.\n\nBut he was still alive; he could not give up now. This adventure upon\nwhich he had launched with such high hopes had turned out differently\nthan expected; but, he told himself, it was not ended yet.\n\nAnd, instead of a lifeless globe, he had found this: a place peopled\nwith strange, half-human life. And, more marvelous still, instead of\nHaldgren, whom he had come to seek, there had been a girl!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nChet had recovered his ability to breathe, had made sure that the oxygen\ntank was intact; and now he called softly into the blackness of this\ndark vault where he had seen her thrown.\n\n\"Are you alive?\" he asked. \"Can you hear me?\"\n\nFor answer came quick rustling of moving bodies, the smooth rasping of\nwings on leathery wings, hands that fumbled for him, then closed about\narms and legs and throat, while in his ears was a chattering of\nhigh-pitched squeals. Again he was lifted in air, held there in the grip\nof a score of lean, long-fingered hands. He was nerving himself to\nundergo without flinching whatever new torture might be in store. Yet he\nthrilled inexplicably as through the sounds of these things about him,\nhe heard a muffled: \"Yes--yes! Oh, I am glad--\"\n\nThe sentence was unfinished. Before Chet's eyes a light was growing. A\nmere slit at first, it grew to a luminous circle in the rocky floor. And\nas it opened, he felt the pressure of his metal suit upon his body,\nwhere before it had been slightly ballooned by the pressure of oxygen he\nhad maintained.\n\nWith the opening of this door to another subterranean chamber had come a\nrenewed atmospheric pressure. And now, in the denser gas, he saw, in\nghastly silhouette against the lighted pit, flying figures that floated\nand soared on outstretched wings of inky black.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBeside him and above he heard the swishing flutter of other wings; he\nfelt himself lifted from the floor; he was being floated out above the\nluminous pit by the flying things that held him.\n\nNo direct glare came from below, but a soft violet radiance. It shone\nfull upon him--past him--to light up and give detail to those faces that\nhad been featureless before. Chet had just one moment of fascinated\nstaring into the diabolical, pasty faces where narrow, red eyes stared\nback into his. Then the squealing voices were stilled!\n\nOne, louder than the rest, rasped an order. And again Chet felt the\nhands relax; once more he was falling, down--down--and still down--until\nhe knew that his velocity of fall meant an impact he could never\nsurvive.\n\nAnd, curiously, as he fell, his mind was entirely unconcerned with his\nown fate. For himself, he had accepted death. But he saw for what seemed\nlike hours a vision of a familiar control room and an Irish pilot who\nsat by the controls. He was looking sharply ahead, he was checking\nspeed, he was landing softly--safely--on a familiar field of Earth....\n\nThat passed; and, following, came a feeling of regret, a deep hurt and\na rage at his own inability to be of help. For, above him, through the\nluminous air, he saw another body falling, and he knew that the girl,\ntoo, had been thrown to the same fate.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThose eyes of blue had locked with his for but a few brief seconds. Who\nshe was--what she was--he had no way of knowing. But in that instant of\nmental meeting there had passed a flash between the two that had burned\ndeeply into Chet's real and hidden self.\n\nChet, himself, had he been in laughing mood, might have smiled at the\nidea of affection being born in that brief time. Yet he might have asked\ninstead how long was needed to bridge the sharp gap of a radio-power\ntransmitter; how much time was needed for anode and cathode each to\nrecognize the other. Something of this was passing in confusion through\nhis mind while his more conscious faculties were tensing his body for\nthe fatal impact he knew must come.\n\nWithout thinking the thought in words he knew that the luminous walls\nhad receded. They were more distant now; their glow came to him from far\nabove, and, as his falling body turned again and again in air, he saw\nthat below him was nothing but a vast emptiness filled with luminous\nvapors that swirled and writhed.\n\nThen the last gleam of lighted walls faded; he was falling at terrific\nspeed through a black tempest whose winds tore and screamed about him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was his own falling speed that made these winds; there remained with\nhim enough of reasoning power to realize this. And he waited, and\nmarveled that he could fall so tremendous a distance. First had been\nthe great shaft down which he had plunged; then, as it widened, had come\nthis greater void. The crater of Hercules must have opened, into a vast\nshell or a cavern of incredible depth. The winged things of the Moon\nknew of it; they had cast him to his death--him and the girl.\n\nHer slowly turning body was not far away; it was as if they two hung\nsuspended in air, while frightful blasts of whatever gas filled this\nspace whipped and shrieked past and wrapped them round with a terrific\npressure. And then the tempest ceased. Slowly the blasts diminished; the\npressure relaxed; gradually the sense of falling passed away, and with\nthis there came a glimpse of light.\n\nAgain the walls glowed as they had before, but far off in the distance.\nChet saw them grow luminous while he seemed hung motionless in space.\nThen once more they drew away from him; once more he knew he was falling\naway from that light--plunging again into the depths he had traversed.\n\nAnd now, despite the oxygen that came to him uninterruptedly, he found\nhis head swimming. The limit of human endurance had been reached.\n\nDesperately he tried to bring his reason to bear upon this miracle that\nhad happened. He had not struck; instead of falling to his death he had\ncushioned against something; he was falling again where, not far away,\nanother metal-clad figure hung limply in air and fell as he fell. And\nwith that knowledge the whirling turmoil within his brain ended in a\nblood-red flashing that went finally to merciful darkness....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat darkness still wrapped him thickly about when he regained\nconsciousness--a darkness saved from utter black only by a faint\nluminosity that seemed to penetrate and be part of the air about him.\n\nStill hardly more than half-conscious, lying, it seemed, on a soft bed\nwhere he was weightless, he stirred and flung out one arm. From his\nfingertips he saw whirls of violet light sweep out and away, as vortices\nmight have been set in motion by a swimmer in a more liquid medium.\n\nFascinated, failing utterly to comprehend where he was, he moved his\nhands deliberately, swept one arm from side to side--and a number of\nluminous whirlpools went spinning out into space. And then he\nremembered.\n\nHe remembered the terrific fall that miraculously brought him back to a\nplace of light like that where his fall had begun. He remembered\nbeginning the second fall; and, while he still could not know what it\nmeant, he knew that he must have been unconscious for hours. And, with\nthat, his thoughts came back to the girl. For the first time he found\nleisure to give mental voice to his wonderment.\n\nThe mystery of it all!--of her presence here on the Moon! Again he was\noverwhelmed with the wonder of his surprising discovery. It was nearly\nbeyond belief; almost he doubted the reality of what his own eyes had\nseen.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut there was no doubting his own presence here in this strange place.\nThe unreality of it--the strangeness of his own sensations--were borne\nin upon him. Where was he? he asked. What was this soft cushion upon\nwhich he rested so lightly? He tried to sit up and found that he merely\ntwisted his body and set other eddies of light into motion.\n\nCautiously, he swung one arm out as far as he could reach. There was\nnothing there. He moved the arm down; reached with his hand beneath\nhim--and still there was nothing tangible! Through his mind swept a\ngripping fear, a wordless, incoherent terror of something he could not\nname. Desperately he wanted to touch something firm and solid; lay his\nhands upon something he knew was real; and he flung out arms and legs in\na paroxysm of futile effort.\n\nHe seemed hung in nothingness, an utter emptiness where nothing moved;\nonly the ghostly whirls of light that ran lazily away from his beating\nhands until they died silently away into darkness, swallowed up in this\nunspeakable horror of soundless space. And, when he had quieted again,\nhe knew with a dreadful certainty that there was nothing there; he was\nsuspended in a great void--immersed in an ocean of some unknown gas.\n\nThe sense of loneliness that filled him was devastating. He could have\nfaced death as he had faced it before, unflinchingly; that was all in\nthe day's work. But here was something that tested sanity itself. Could\nhe but touch something substantial, he told himself, it would help him\nto keep a grip on reality; even to see and feel one of the winged\nhorrors would be in a way a relief.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis struggles had ceased; all about him the atmosphere was quivering and\nwrithing with whirling light that swirled and danced and mingled one\nglowing vortex with another. Then it, too, died; and, through the dark\nthat was relieved only by the faint luminosity of the quiescent gas, he\nsaw far off a point of light.\n\nHere was something to which he could pin his eyes; something outside of\nhimself and the horror of nothingness in which he was immersed. He\nstared through the window of his helmet while the light grew and\nexpanded into nebulous, cloudy glowing that faded and was gone.\n\nAgain it came and died; and a third time. And then Chet Bullard swore\nloudly and harshly within the silence of his own metal sheath, while he\ncursed his own dullness that had kept him from instant comprehension.\n\nThat light was far away, but, \"Keep moving!\" Chet called, hoping that\nhis voice might span the void. \"Keep moving so I can see your light!\nI'll try to swim over.\"\n\nHe threw himself over with a convulsive jerk and flattened the palms of\nhis hands in a breaststroke, while he kicked with his feet against the\ndense atmosphere about him. And he saw with delight that the whirling\nripples of light moved back of him; he felt that he was making some\nheadway, slight though it must be.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe saw her at last, and heard her call:\n\n\"I am swimming, too,\" she cried. \"How wonderful to see you! This\nloneliness! It is horrible--unbearable!\"\n\n\"I understand,\" Chet said; \"it is pretty bad.\"\n\nThen, at sound of a stifled sob, he gripped one reaching hand hard and\ntried to bring himself out from under the pall that numbed his own mind;\nhe even attempted to force a note of lightness into his words.\n\n\"I've flown everything with wings,\" he told her, \"but this is the first\ntime I ever flew myself. Guess I was never properly designed.\"\n\nFeeble, this attempt at humor; but there was none to note the strained\nedge in his tone, only a girl, whose metal-clad hand closed in a tight\nhold upon his.\n\n\"You can joke--_now_,\" she said with a catch in her voice that showed\nhow desperately hard she was trying to meet Chet's fortitude and force\nher own words to steadiness. \"That takes--real nerve. I like that!\"\n\nThen she added: \"But it's hopeless; you know that. They've got us. And\nnow that some of them have been killed they will--they will--\"\n\nAnd the trace of Chet's strained smile that lingered on his lips, could\nshe have seen it, would have appeared grim.\n\n\"Whatever it was you didn't say, I agree with. I imagine the finish will\nnot be pleasant.\" Once more he was facing the inevitable; and, as\nbefore, he faced it squarely and knowingly, then put it completely from\nhis mind. There was so much he must know before that adventure's end was\nreached.\n\n\"Tell me,\" he demanded, \"who are 'they'? Where are they? How many are\nthere of them? And where have they got us? What kind of a place is this,\nwhere all natural laws are suspended, where gravitation is at zero?\n\n\"And, for heaven's sake, tell me: who are you? Where are you from? How\ndid you get here on the Moon?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat uncontrollable catch in the girl's voice had taken on a trace of\nbrave laughter that overlay the trembling sob in her throat.\n\n\"That is a lot of information,\" she said, \"and I am afraid it will not\nmake much difference if you know. Oh, I wish I had some atom of\nencouragement for you! I do not know who you are either--and you have\nbeen so brave! You have come here, I brought you with my signals for\nhelp--brought you to your death.\n\n\"For it _is_ death! This is the end of our adventuring--mine and yours\nas well--here at the center, the exact center of the Moon.\"\n\n\"Ah-h!\" answered Chet Bullard softly, as understanding came to him. \"I\nshould have guessed it. The atmospheric pressure and density--and we\nfell past the center, then back again; we've been vibrating back and\nforth until we came to rest at last. And now we die! Well, it might have\nbeen worse.\"\n\nHe was staring out through the little window of his helmet, staring into\nthe faintly luminous atmosphere, facing the end of his brave fling with\nfortune. It was an instant before he realized that there was something\nmoving in the void. He pressed softly upon the hand he held and pointed.\n\n\"See!\" he said in a hushed tone. \"There is something there!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt took form slowly, a shapeless, round blur in the pale light. Inch by\ninch it drifted toward them, until Chet moved one hand abruptly and\nfound he had created a ripple of light by which he could see more\nclearly. And he saw before him a bulging, membraneous sac.\n\nIt had been smoothly spherical before; it heaved itself into strange\nprotuberances as he watched. He flipped his hand to set up another\nvortex of light, and he saw the first rip that formed in the membrane.\n\nBefore his staring eyes the bag burst open; and Chet, who had wished for\nsome substantial thing, even a denizen of this wild world, found his\nwish fulfilled. For the thin membrane tore in a score of places to\nrelease a body from within--a shapeless, huddled mass of chalk-white\nflesh in a wrapping of black leather that unfolded before his eyes and\nbecame wings which waved feebly in their first attempt at flight.\n\nThe pallid body, supple as a giant worm, jerked spasmodically and turned\nsightless eyes toward the watching Earth-folk. Then, as if drawn by some\nmagnet, invisible in the distance, the black wings began to beat the\nair, and the creature moved off in a straight line toward some unknown\ngoal.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnother of the membraneous spheres drifted past in the light that came\nfrom those fluttering wings. A second showed in repulsive shininess.\nChet was aware that there were many of the things about.\n\n\"Eggs!\" he exclaimed with a disgust that partook of nausea, \"And the\ndamnable thing hatched--right here!--before our eyes!\"\n\nAnd the girl gave the final explanation: \"The Moon is just a great\nshell. They lay their eggs, these half-human creatures that you saw, and\nattach them to the inner surface of that shell. Then at a certain period\nthey come loose and float away. I never knew what became of them; now I\nunderstand at last.\"\n\n\"You know all this!\" protested Chet. \"How can you know it? How long have\nyou been here?\"\n\n\"I kept track of time for a while,\" said the voice beside him; \"then I\nforgot it when they took Frithjof away. But it must be about five years.\nFive years of terror and vain hopes and wild plans for escape! And now\nit ends--after five years!\"\n\nAnd Chet Bullard, within his metal helmet, was repeating in\nbewilderment: \"Five years! Haldgren left five years ago! What does it\nmean?\"\n\nNor did he pause to realize that through his amazement was woven a\nthread of another hue, tinged faintly with jealousy that demanded of\nhim: \"Frithjof! Who is Frithjof who was taken away?\"\n\nChet's mind was filled with a confusion of questions that jostled one\nanother to silence when he tried to give them expression. And there was\nlittle time for questioning.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe saw other floating eggs whose membraneous coverings had turned\nleathery and opaque. And he saw white phantom figures who gathered those\neggs. One came near till Chet could make out the repulsive face and\nblack, staring eyes with their fiery red center. It was one of the\nthings that had captured him; he saw it move swiftly on broad wings. It\nheld a leathery egg in its curled-claw hands while its long tail whipped\naround and laid the egg open with one slash of a sharp spiked point.\n\nOne more of the young of this horrible species was liberated and went\nwinging away into the dark, only the whirls of light in the atmosphere\nmarking the beating of its wings.\n\nChet's eyes followed it to see far out beyond a light that expanded as\nit drew near. The beaten atmospheric gas was whipped to cold flame where\nsome ten or a dozen phantom demons came swiftly on toward the waiting\nhumans.\n\nThey were swarming about in an instant. Chet had no time for even a\nshouted warning before he felt himself seized by their long, bony claws.\nThen a net of rough-fibered rope was flung about him, and he felt it\ndraw tight as the winged beasts lifted him up and out into the void.\n\n\"Wrong again!\" Chet told himself ruefully. \"We don't die at the center\nof the Moon, after all!\" But, as the whipping wings drove whirling\nblasts of violet light back upon him he could find nothing of comfort in\nthe thought that some different experience still lay ahead.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n_The Gateway to Hell_\n\n\nSpud O'Malley, at the controls of the ship, held the craft in a vertical\nlift while his eyes clung in horrible fascination to the mirrors that\nshowed from a lower lookout the volcanic floor falling away. Amazement\nhad almost stifled his breathing, until at last he let go a long breath\nthat ended in a curse.\n\n\"The outrageous, damned things!\" he breathed. \"Jumping, they were, and\nleaping, and flying on their leather wings like a lot of black bats out\no' hell! And I'm thinkin' that's where they've taken Chet Bullard, and\nnever again will he hold a ship like 'twas in the hollow of his hand,\nand him settin' it down like a feather!\n\n\"And: 'Fly back home!' he says to me. I can do it, too; thanks to his\nteachin'. But fly back and leave that bhoy in the hands of those\nmurderin' devils!--'tis little he knows the Irish!\"\n\nHe was talking half under his breath, murmuring to himself as if it\nhelped him to see clearly the situation that must be faced.\n\n\"But to get to him--that's the trouble. I saw a big door go shut in that\nstone floor. They're cunnin', clever beasts; I'll say that for 'em. And\nthere was a raft of 'em; and plenty more down in hell where they live,\nI've no doubt.\"\n\nHe moved forward on the ball-control, and the great ship swept like a\nsilvery shadow through the night toward the distant, lighted crater rim.\nThis he could see clearly, but the other side of the ring of mountains\nwas black with shadow.\n\nAnd, far out beyond, spread like a cloud over all the desolate world,\nwas blackness. Spud drove the ship up another five thousand feet, and\nstill that darkness spread out in inky pools where only an occasional\nmountain peak caught the flat rays of the sun.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd what had Chet called these dark areas? \"Lake of Dreams\" and \"Lake of\nDeath.\" Spud's superstitious mind was a-quiver with dread and an\nominous premonition to which the empty, frozen wastes below him gave\nadded force.\n\n\"I'll have to wait,\" he told himself. \"The light of the Moon--I mean the\nEarth--is bright, but not bright enough. I'll just wait till the Sun\nclimbs higher. When it shines down into that hole that is the gateway to\nhell--and well I know it--then I can see what is there. Then, maybe, I\ncan find some way to get inside; and I hope the lad lives till I get\nthere.\"\n\nHe circled back; swept down in a long, leisurely flight, and came again\nto the place of gently sloping rock where Chet had first landed. And he\nsearched till he found the identical spot and laid the ship down on a\nlevel keel.\n\nFar away the Sun was gilding the hard outlines of mountains that ringed\nthem in. Spud did not know how long he must wait. Had he realized that\nit must be a matter of days it is probable he would have donned the\nmetal suit and started out. But instead he busied himself in a careful\ninvestigation of the storeroom and a check-up of ammunition and supplies\nthat were there.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe lunar day, as all Earth-men know, is a matter of nearly fifteen of\nEarth's days. Spud O'Malley was wild with impatience when at last the\nSun was striking less flatly across the land and he knew that the time\nhad come when he could start.\n\nHe had sensed the change that took place in the world outside; from the\nlookouts of the control room he had seen the bare rocks lose their white\nmarkings of hoar frost and at last actually quiver with heat as the Sun\nbeat upon them. He had seen the growing things that crept from every\ncrevice and hollow--pale, colorless mosses that threw out long tendrils\nwhich licked across the hot rocks as if hungry for the nourishment the\nthin air brought.\n\nSpud knew nothing of the carbon dioxide which these pale green growths\ncould combine with water under the Sun's hot rays and build into\nvegetable tissue. But he marveled again and again at the hungry things\nthat made a mesh of ropy strands across the smooth area about the ship.\nThey even hung in drooping masses from the weird rocks beyond; and, so\nlight they were, they raised their heads hungrily in air, while the\ncorded tendrils even threw themselves in contorted writhings at times\nwhen the Sun struck with increasing warmth.\n\n\"A dead world!\" said Spud scornfully. \"How much the scientists back\nthere don't know! First those livin', flyin' devils; and now this! The\nwhole place is fairly wrigglin' with life.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was then that he made one last flight over the inner crater and saw\nlight on the floor of stone in the funneled depths. Then he sent the\nship like a rocket down to the shelf of rock where Chet had begun his\ndescent; and he worked with trembling fingers to adjust the metal suit\nand regulate the oxygen supply.\n\nHe waited only to strap a couple of detonite pistols about him; then,\nwith never a backward look, he let himself out through the air-locking\ndoors and started pell-mell toward the inner crater.\n\nLike Chet, he had learned to gage his tremendous strength; like the\nmaster pilot, he threw himself down the rocky slope. But where Chet had\nleaped and stumbled in the darkness, O'Malley worked in full light.\n\nHe came at last to the rocky floor where molten stone in ages past had\nhardened to seal the throat of this vent. Hundreds of feet across, Spud\nestimated; smooth in appearance from above, but broken with deep\ncrevasses and excrescences where hot, fluid stone had frozen in its\nmoment of bubbling turbulence. And, in one place, where the floor was\nsmooth, Spud found what he was searching for: a circular, metal ledge\nthat projected above the smooth rock; and, within it, a still smoother\nsheet of what appeared to be hammered metal.\n\n\"A door it is,\" whispered the pilot, half-fearful of listening ears,\n\"and the gateway to Hell!\" He grinned broadly at some thought. \"And here\nI've been told 'twas, of all places, the easiest to get into; one little\nslip from grace and there you were! Sure, and the priests were as wrong\nas the scientists. It must be Heaven that's easy to crash, for the front\ndoor of Hades is shut fast without even a keyhole to peep through.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen his face sobered to its customary homely lines. \"The poor bhoy!\" he\nexclaimed. \"I've got to get in some way. I wonder how hard and thick it\nis.\"\n\nHe was raising a mass of black, shining rock in his hands--a fragment\nthat his strength would not have moved a fraction of an inch on Earth.\nHe steadied it above his head, preparing to crash it upon the metal\ndoor; then waited; stared incredulously at the black metal sheet;\nlowered the great stone silently and turned to leap mightily yet with\nnever a sound for the shelter of an upflung saw-toothed ridge.\n\nAnd, from its shelter, he watched the black door swing smoothly into the\nair, while, from the gaping black mouth of the pit beneath, incredible\nman-shapes of fish-belly white drew themselves up to the edge of the pit\nand perched there, where they might stretch their long necks into the\nlight of the Sun.\n\nBelow them, Spud saw, dangled long, rat-like tails; and their wings,\nblack and leathery, hung down too from their backs or dragged on the\nrocks behind where some three or four of the owl-eyed creatures crawled\nout and walked across the rock toward the place where an Irish pilot\nwaited and stared with unbelieving and horrified eyes from the\nconcealment of his rocky fort.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n_The Fires_\n\n\nGreat vortices of whirling light rolled out to either side in an endless\npyrotechnical display to show the power of those flailing wings that\nwere bearing Chet and his companion through the dark void--bearing them\nto some destination Chet could not envisage.\n\nHis body turned in space at times, and he saw the spreading cone of\nluminous gas behind them like the wake of a great ship in a\nphosphorescent sea. The hiss and threshing of many wings came\nunceasingly. Once he swung close to another body clad like his own and,\nlike him, enmeshed in a net. And he saw in the light of the luminiferous\nair the girl's wide, staring eyes. Then she was gone, and all about was\nonly the whip of wings and the flashing whirls of light.\n\nHe tried to form some picture of this sphere through whose center, empty\nbut for this gas, he was being swung. That first fall had carried him\ndown the tube of some volcanic blow-pipe; he had fallen straight for\nwhat seemed like hours. And that had been through the crust of this\ngreat, hollow globe. Then the center!--but of this he dared make no\nestimate; he knew only that the huge leather wings were threshing the\ndense air in an untiring rhythm and that he was being carried for a\ntremendous distance at remarkable speed.\n\nIt became soothing, that rushing, swinging sweep of his body through\nspace. There was death ahead, without doubt--but what of that? He was\nsleepy--sleepy--and beyond this nothing mattered. Just to sleep, to\ndrift off in spirit into a void like this through which he was\nswinging....\n\nAnd so traveled Chet Bullard, one time Master Pilot of Earth, through,\nthe heart of another world--on and endlessly on, while leather-winged\ndemons dragged him after, flying straight away from the center of the\nMoon toward a place and events unknown.\n\nBut Chet Bullard had ceased to note the passing hours or the swirling\ngases that came alight at the beating of those wings; he was asleep in a\nstupor that was as deep as it was timeless.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe opened his eyes at last; it seemed but a moment that he had slept.\nBut now there was no rushing hiss of air, nor was he being lifted in a\ngreat net. He lay instead upon a support of some kind, and about him all\nwas still.\n\nNot at first did he observe the exquisite carving of the yellow bed on\nwhich he lay; that came later. The fact that its massive gold and its\nscrollwork of inlaid platinum were worth a fortune meant nothing to him\nthen. His eyes were held by the immensity of the great room and the\nintricate series of arches that made up a vaulted ceiling.\n\nIt shone with a light of its own, that carved ceiling; no least lovely\ndetail was lost. And Chet found his eyes roving from one to another of\nangel figures that seemed suspended in air.\n\nThe white of purest alabaster was theirs; and their outstretched wings,\ntoo, were white. He realized confusedly that they were like the black\ndemons--like them and yet entirely unlike. For, where the black-winged\nones had been ugly of feature, with every mark of degeneracy, these were\nthe ultimate of loveliness in face and form. Figures of men he saw,\nstalwart and strong, yet perfectly proportioned; and the others--the\nwomen and girls--were superhuman in their ethereal beauty.\n\n\"Angels!\" breathed Chet and turned his head slowly to see the exquisite\nfigures that seemed hovering above the whole vast room in silent\nbenediction. \"Angels--no less! And they're carved from stone! Those\nblack devils never did it. What does it mean? What does it mean!\"\n\nAnd not until then did Chet realize a wonderful thing. So enthralled had\nhe been by the wonder of this hovering angel band he had not realized\nthat he was seeing them with no helmet glass between; he was lying\ndisrobed on his couch of pure gold.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor an instant, panic seized him. Without his helmet and the oxygen\nsupply, he must strangle. And then he knew that he was breathing\nnaturally in an atmosphere like that of Earth but for the strange\nfragrances that swept to him on the soft, warm air.\n\nHe came slowly to his feet and steadied himself with one hand on the\nscrollwork of the bed. Then memories rushed in upon him, and he lived\nagain the long, sickening fall through the heart of this world, the\nfinding of the girl of mystery, hung like himself in the immensity of\nthe inner world, their capture; and the band of black-winged ones who\nswung them through space in nets that drew tightly about them.\n\nThe girl! Again he saw the clear look from those eyes of blue. It was\nshe who had signaled; it was she whom he had come through vast space to\nrescue. And now she was lost!\n\nChet stared slowly about him at the magnificence of the tremendous room.\nHe saw more delicate figures done in inlay on the walls; he knew that he\nwas in a place whose beauty and wealth should have set his nerves\ntingling; and all he sensed was the loneliness of this place where he\nwas the only living occupant.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe found his Earth-clothes beside the golden couch. He had put them on\nand was examining the suit and helmet to learn with relief that they\nwere intact when the first sound came to him. From an arched entrance\nacross the room were coming shuffling figures whose black wings were\nwrapped about their chalk-white bodies. Only their pallid faces showed,\nghastly and inhuman, as the eyes glowed redly from their deep black\nsockets. Chet still held the suit in his hands as the black-winged ones\ncame toward him across the floor, and he carried it with him as he moved\nunresistingly where they led him with the pull of their claw-like hands\nupon his arms.\n\n\"No gun!\" he told himself hopelessly. \"Not a chance if I put up a fight!\nThey've got me and got me right. Now what I need to do is to be\ngood--lay low--find out something about all this, and find her!\" He\ncould not name the girl whose eyes were haunting him in their appealing\nloveliness; he could think of her only as the mystery girl, and he\naccepted without surprise or denial the fact that the finding of her\noutweighed all else that this new world might hold for him.\n\nAs the shuffling figures closed about him and led him away he found\nrelief in the thought of his ship, of Spud's safety, and of his return\nto the world that they both knew as home.\n\n\"Never again for me!\" said Chet softly beneath his breath. \"But Spud\nwill get there. Perhaps he is there now--no telling how long I have\nslept!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe saw it all so plainly: saw the Irish pilot bringing the ship to rest\nat the great Hoover Terminal. And he saw, too, a relief expedition that\nwould be organized by Harkness and that must arrive too late. To suppose\nthat any help might reach him here inside this wild world was too much;\nChet looked with judicially appraising eyes at the things about him and\ncould not allow himself to be deceived. There was no hope; but he made\none resolve and made it grimly in words that never reached his lips.\n\n\"Give me half a chance at them, Walt,\" he promised, \"and if ever you do\nget inside here, you'll know where I've been. I'll find the girl\nfirst--I must do that--then I'll give these devils something to remember\nme by before they put us away for good!\" And now the face of the pilot\nwas almost happy as he stared at the snarling, twisted features of those\nthat led him unresistingly through a series of stone rooms that seemed\nwithout beginning or end. He even disregarded the spiked tails that\nwhipped at him with heavy blows to hurry him along.\n\n\"If I had a gun,\" he told them inaudibly, \"I'd take you on right now.\nBut you got that, or I lost it in the scuffle, so I'll just twist your\nscrawny necks in my bare hands when the time comes. And it's coming, you\nugly devils! It's coming!\"\n\nTheir claws pulled roughly at him to hurry him into another room. And\nwhere before he could see nothing of a beautiful room because of the\nabsence of a pair of smiling eyes, he now saw nothing else for their\npresence. For, across the great hall, whose walls and ceilings glowed\nsoftly with yellow light, his eyes swept unerringly to a slim figure in\na pilot's suit--to an oval face and blue eyes and red lips that could\nstill curve into a trembling smile of welcome as he drew near.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nForgotten was the grip of sharp-spiked, clawing hands; even the\nanticipated sweets of revenge were lost from Chet's mind. He knew only\nthat he had found her--the mystery girl--and that the blue eyes were\nlocked with his in an intimacy that set something deep within him into a\nturmoil of emotion.\n\nAnd instead of the countless questions he had expected to launch upon\nher when again they met, he found his lips trembling and wordless--until\nthey uttered one hoarse ejaculation of: \"Thank God!\"\n\nBut the girl seemed to understand, for she reached one slender hand to\ntouch him lightly upon the arm where these gripping claws had been.\n\"Yes,\" she whispered; \"I was afraid, too--afraid for you!\"\n\nMore whispered words, but they were lost to Chet in the babel of sound\nthat engulfed them. Those who had brought him had moved silently, and\nthe throng of some hundred or more that waited beside the girl had been\nmute. But now they burst into a chorus of shrill cries whose keenness\nstabbed at Chet's ears.\n\nA pandemonium of the same high-pitched squeals, he had heard\nbefore--this was all that he could distinguish at first. Then the shrill\nsounds broke into words and unintelligible phrases, and he knew they\nwere talking among themselves.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey quieted at a sound from the girl. She had turned to face them, and\nshe forced her own soft voice into a shrill pitch as she spoke to them.\nTheir clamor broke out once more as she ceased, but it was more\nsubdued. Chet could hear her as she turned toward him.\n\n\"They think you are Frithjof,\" she explained.\n\n\"You talked with them?\" asked Chet incredulously.\n\n\"But certainly; have I not been here for five years? They have their\nlanguage--but enough of that now. They are angry. They sent Frithjof\naway; they tell me now that he escaped; they think you are he--that you\nhave changed your appearance with magic--that the ship they saw was\nsummoned by your magic. They say they will kill us both; throw us to the\nfires!\"\n\n\"Wait!\" almost shouted Chet to make himself heard above the din of\nshrieking voices. \"I've got to know! Who are you? Who is Frithjof? How\ndid you get here? Where are you from? Tell me quickly! It may give me\nsomething to go on; it may mean a chance for delay.\"\n\nAnd if Chet had not been out of breath from the shouted questions, he\nwould surely have been left breathless by their amazing answer.\n\n\"I thought you knew,\" said the girl as the din of shrillness subsided.\nThere seemed to Chet a note of hurt in her voice. \"I thought you knew,\nthat you had come here knowing. I am Anita, and Frithjof is my\nbrother--Frithjof Haldgren! I stowed away on his ship; he did not know.\nI was only thirteen then.... And now, is Frithjof forgotten back in that\nworld that we left?\"\n\nAgain that note of disappointment; the pilot sensed it even through the\ntenseness of the moment when both Earth-folk knew that death stood close\nat their side. He answered quickly:\n\n\"I came for your brother. I saw your signals. I came to find Haldgren\nand to save him. And I have failed. But if death, as you say, is all we\ncan expect, let me say this: 'I have failed, but I have found you; and\nwhatever comes I am content.'\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe blue eyes were wide; they were looking at him with a searching\nglance that changed to a childish candor while a flush stole over the\npale face. She reached out one hand toward his. \"We could have been\nhappy,\" she said simply; \"and now--now we must face the\nfires--together.\"\n\n\"I don't know just what you mean by that,\" spoke Chet softly, \"but,\nwhatever it is, there is a little matter of a fight first.\"\n\nHe released her hand and moved swiftly between her and the nearer of the\nthrong; and his blood pulsed strongly through him as he faced a battery\nof hostile red eyes and knew that he was preparing for his last fight.\n\nA hand clutched at his arm. \"Not now!\" begged Anita Haldgren's voice.\n\"Wait! They will not all come. I too, can fight; but we cannot face so\nmany!\"\n\nThe rat-tails of the nearest beasts were whipping to and fro; the eyes\nin the chalky faces were like living coals where the ashes have been\nfreshly blown. Chet stepped back beside the girl, and he made no protest\nas the black claws seized him and the sharp talons dug into his flesh.\nBut he whispered to the one who was hurried along beside him: \"You are\nright; I'll be good as long as we stay together. But if not--if we're\nseparated--if they take you away--\"\n\nAnd the girl nodded quick agreement with his unspoken words.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nChet set his teeth together to make more bearable the pain of those\ngripping claws; but the hurt was easier to bear when he saw that the\ngirl was more carefully treated. She was close ahead as his captors\nhustled him from this room into others and yet others, all carved from\nthe solid rock.\n\nWhat a people this must be who could do such work as this! Again the\nsense of amazement struck through to Chet despite the pain--amazement\nand a feeling of an inexplicable incongruity when he saw the\nleather-winged creatures that had him in their grip. And again there\nwere figures high overhead--white, floating figures on pinions of pure\nwhite; their faces, kindly and serene, looked down upon the motley\nthrong.\n\n\"Look above you!\" gasped Chet. \"Anita! What are they? Not like these\ndevils!\"\n\nAnd the girl ahead half-turned her head to answer: \"Ancestors! A\nthousand generations back! They have come down to this state\nnow--degenerated.\"\n\nChet saw one of the beasts who held her jerk her sharply about, and he\nknew that his remaining questions must wait--wait forever, perhaps, and\nremain unsaid.\n\nThey came at last to a place where Chet found the answer to one question\nhe had not dared ask; a place where gaping chasms in the floor glowed\nred with the wrath of unquenched fires. And the girl, Anita, when they\nhad been placed by themselves against a glowing, lighted wall of rock,\nstared steadily at those pits and the sulphurous fumes that vomited out\nat times; then turned and spoke to the pilot in a voice steady and sure.\n\n\"It will be over quickly,\" she assured him. \"Frithjof said that the\nheat, like the warmth of this whole inner world, comes from the\ncontraction of the rocks in the cold of night. There is great pressure\ndeveloped ... but he never learned the source of the light in the\nwalls.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTalking to still the beating of a heart pulsing with dread, perhaps!\nChet had no mind for explanations. Before him were a score of yawning\nclefts in a rocky floor; one was larger than the rest; there were\nfigures whose white bodies glowed red in its reflected light as they\nfloated on black wings high above; the light of those hidden fires\nblazed and died intermittently. There death was waiting, while these\ndemons--these degenerate half-men, living products of a dying\nrace--whipped the air in a frenzy of expectation as they darted above\nthose chasms that were like rifts in the rock roof of hell.\n\nChet did not answer the statements of the girl. Instead he turned and\ngathered her once into his arms, while his lips met hers to find a ready\nresponse. Her face, so calm and pale, was turned upward to his. And his\nown voice trembled at first; then was steady and firm.\n\n\"I love you. I've come a long way to tell you, and I didn't know why I\ncame. And now it is too late.\"\n\n\"Anita Haldgren,\" he said, and let his voice linger as he repeated the\nname, \"Anita Haldgren--a beautiful name--a beautiful soul! And now--\" He\nreleased her quickly and swung to meet a rush of beastly things that\nhalf-ran, half-flew across the great room.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOutstretched arms of white that ended in black claws! Snarling, grinning\nteeth in faces of dead-white flesh! Barbed tails that hissed through the\nair as they swung down upon him! And Chet Bullard, his blond hair\nshining like the gold that was inlaid and encrusted upon the walls of\nthe room--Chet Bullard, Master Pilot, once, of a distant Earth--did not\nwait for the assault to reach him, but sprang in upon the beastly things\nwith swinging fists that came up from beneath to crash into grinning\nfaces; to smash dully into white, scabrous flesh; or catch beneath the\nangle of out-thrust jaws jolt the ghastly faces into awkward angles.\n\nThey went down before him at first. Then the long rat-tails came\nwhipping over, the demon-heads, ripping down with slashing blows on the\npilot's head and shoulders. Off at one side, a dozen paces away, a\nslender figure tore loose from gripping claws. Chet saw it; he freed\nhimself for an instant to leap to her side. She was tugging at a bar of\ngold, a scepter in the hands of a sculptured figure in the wall. It\nwould have been a serviceable weapon, but it bent slowly. Another of the\nbeasts was upon her as Chet sprang.\n\nThis one went down beneath the chopping right that Chet shot to a lean,\nwhite jaw; then a barbed tail caught him a blow that laid his shoulder\nopen. Another descended--and another. The pilot sank to the floor. Anita\nwas beside him, shielding him with her own body from the rain of blows.\nThen they were buried beneath a great weight of odorous bodies--till\nChet, after a time, felt himself dragged to his feet.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis head, was ringing with the shrieks of the shrill-voiced mob. He was\nstill struggling, still fighting blindly, as the clamor ceased. Then he\nstood erect and motionless as he heard the voice of Anita Haldgren.\n\n\"It's Frithjof!\" she cried. \"Oh, my dear--my dear! It's Frithjof! I\nheard him! But he can't reach us--he can't help us! I will try to\nreason with these beasts--bargain with them--make them afraid! I will\ntell them it is magic.\"\n\nAnd, as her voice, high-pitched in the language of this race, rose in\nprotest against them, Chet heard what the girl had detected first: a\nsharp, metallic rapping within the wall, a rapping that was dulled by\ndistance but whose separate blows were distinct; and he knew, with a\nknowledge that came from somewhere else than his bewildered brain, that\nthe raps were forming dots and dashes. They were talking Morse!\n\nThe girl's frenzied appeal ended in a din of shrieks; a horde of\nman-beasts swept into the air and launched themselves in a solid mass\nupon the two. Chet saw Anita for one instant as he felt himself lifted\nin air. About him was a pandemonium of flailing wings; ahead and below\nwas the red of hidden fires. They were being lifted out and over the\npits.\n\nOne instant only, while tortured eyes smiled bravely into his; then a\ngreat pit-mouth that gaped a horrible welcome up ahead. So plainly Chet\nsaw it! He could not tear his eyes away. He saw the red, smoking breath\nof it; he saw a rocky lip that shone like one great ruby.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was impossible! Even the blast of air that tore at him meant nothing\nat first! But it was happening! Before his eyes it was happening! Chet\nwatched dumbly, uncomprehendingly, as that great overhanging rock tore\nitself into fragments that rose screamingly into the air or fell to the\ndepths beneath.\n\nAnother section of solid floor erupted a hundred feet across the room!\nThe destruction was being kept away, Chet knew. And then, while a roar\nlike all the thunders of Earth reverberated deafeningly through the rock\nroom, the claws that gripped him relaxed their hold.\n\nHe fell, nor felt the impact of his fall. He came to his feet, ran\nstumblingly to the edge of the nearest pit where he threw his arms about\nthe body of a girl and dragged her to safety. And while he did it he\nwas babbling in broken sentences:\n\n\"It's detonite! Your brother!... Where did he get it?... Detonite!...\nOh, my dear--my dear!\"\n\nAnd his arms were tight about her while he held his body between her and\nthe explosions that tore at the floor in an inferno of crashing\nexplosions out beyond--until three of the demon-beasts, red with the\nreflected fires of that subterranean hell, flew down like black-winged\nbats bent on vengeance. And Chet, laughing at their numbers, sprang out\nwith hard fists swinging in well-directed blows, and welcomed them as\nonly an Earth-man could.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n_O'Malley Investigates_\n\n\nSpud O'Malley's twinkling Irish eyes had seen strange sights in his\nyears of piloting an Intercolonial freighter; he had touched at odd\ncorners of the Earth. But never had he seen such creatures as confronted\nhim now.\n\nSheltered behind a jagged ridge of volcanic rock in the inner crater of\nthe great ring of Hercules, he stared in utter horror at the figures\nthat approached. For to Spud, with all his inherited ancestral faith in\ngnomes and pixies, these bat-winged things were nothing less than people\nof the under world--demons from some purgatory of the Moon--devils,\nliving and breathing, spewed out from that buried hell for a moment of\nrelaxation from their horrid work.\n\nAnd, coming directly toward him across a level lava bed, three of the\nthings, with leather wings trailing, were approaching. Spud was\nunmoving; his feet might have been one with the volcanic rock on which\nhe stood for any ability of his to raise them. Only his eyes turned\nslowly in their sockets to stare wildly at the three who drew near; who\nglimpsed his awe-stricken eyes behind his helmet glass; and who uttered\nshrill, screaming cries that brought the rest of the unholy crew leaping\nand flapping across the rocks.\n\nAnd, within that helmet, Spud's lips moved unconsciously to repeat\nprayers he would have sworn were forgotten these many years. There was a\npistol at his belt where his hand was resting; another hung at his other\nside. But the man made no move to defend himself; he was struck numb and\nnerveless, not through fear, but through that horror which comes with\nseeing one's most gruesome superstitions come true. Spud O'Malley, who\nwould have laughed at devils and believed in them while he laughed, knew\nnow that they were real. They had captured Chet; they were about to take\nhim, too, to the hell that was their home.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd still he did not move while the demon figures pressed closer, while\ntheir wild, shrieking cries echoed within his helmet; while they lashed\ntheir scaly tails, and at last leaped in unison upon the helpless man.\n\nAnd then, with that first touch, Spud O'Malley, who had not only seen\nstrange creatures but had fought with them, came to himself--and the\nhand that rested upon a detonite pistol moved like the head of a\nstriking snake.\n\nThe roar of detonite was strained and thin in the light atmosphere of\nthis globe; it seemed futile compared with its usual thunderous report.\nBut its effects were the same as might have been expected on Earth!\n\nSpud was hurled to the rocky floor, as much by the closeness of the\nexploding shells as by the weight of the bodies that came upon him. He\nfell free of the first leaping things that went to fragments in mid-air\nas his pistol checked them. And he made no effort to arise, but lay\nprostrate, while he swung that slender tube of death about him and saw\nthe winged beasts shattered and torn--until there were but five who ran\nwildly with frantic, flapping wings; and these the tiny shells from\nSpud's gun caught as they ran when the Irishman sprang to his feet and\ntook careful aim across the jagged rocks.\n\n\"Saints be praised!\" the pilot was saying over and over. \"Saints be\nthanked!--even the Devil's imps can't stand up to detonite shells! And\nChet, the poor lad!--his gun must have been knocked from his hand; he\nwas fightin' in the dark, too! And they took him down there, they\ndid!--down where I'm goin' to see if the lad is still livin'.\"\n\nAnd Spud O'Malley, though he believed fully in the demoniac nature of\nthese opponents and never for an instant thought but that he was\ndescending into an inferno of the Moon, strode with steady steps toward\nthe portal of that Plutonic region and lowered himself within.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat ring of metal, huge and accurately formed, made Spud pause in\nthought; the massive metal door that came up from below to fit that ring\nsnugly--that, too, looked more like the work of human hands than of\ndemons. The pilot was frankly puzzled as he tentatively moved a lever\ndown below that door and saw the huge metal mass swing shut.\n\nAbout him the walls were glowing. He saw, in the floor, another circular\ndoor, but found no lever with which to operate it. Nor did he search for\none, since he could have no way of knowing that here was where Chet had\ngone. But, from the corridor where he stood other lighted passages led;\nand one slanted more steeply than the rest.\n\n\"That's the way I'm goin',\" announced Spud. \"I know that, and it's all I\ndo know; I'm goin' down till I find some place where the devils live and\nwhere Chet may be.\"\n\nThe passage took him smoothly down. It turned at times, and smaller\nbranches split off, but he followed the main corridor that he had\nselected for his route. And he paused, at last, beside a metal frame in\nthe rock wall, where the door that fitted so tightly in the frame was\nnot like the others he had seen. For the first ones, though cleverly\nfashioned and machined, were of iron, rusted red with the ages; while\nthis one that was before him now was paneled and decorated with sweeping\nscrolls. And, above this portal that seemed hermetically sealed, was a\nwhite figure such as Chet had seen.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSpud's gaze traveled up to it slowly, and his knees were trembling as\nthey had not done when facing the black-winged ones. \"'Tis an angel,\" he\nwhispered, \"or the statue of one! And that explains it all. 'Tis them\nthat has done all this--these passages, and the sweet-fittin' doors. And\ndo they live here? I wonder. Heaven help me if I meet them, for never\ncould I shoot at one of them, the pretty things!\"\n\nHe was still gazing in rapt wonder that was near to worship when the\ngreat door began to move. He saw the first hair-line crack, and the thin\nline of light was like a hot wire across his eyes, so quickly did he\nrespond. Beyond, where he had not yet gone, was a branching passage. All\nthe walls glowed softly with light--no shelter of darkness was his--but\nSpud leaped for the little passage and raced down it until a turn\nscreened him from sight.\n\n\"That's movin'!\" he congratulated himself. \"What an athlete I'm\nbecomin'!\" And it was fortunate for the pilot that the ceiling was high,\nfor his tremendous Earth-strength propelled him in unbelievable bounds.\n\nHe still moved on silently, for far ahead in the corridor something had\ncaught his eyes. And he stopped finally beside a little car; then saw\nthat he had been following a single rail, buried under the dust of ages\non the corridor floor.\n\nThe monorail car lay on its side. At one end of it was a motor. Not a\nmotor such as men had built, Spud confessed, but an electric motor none\nthe less. And beyond this, where the passage ended, was a wall veined\nthickly with gold.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRopy strands of the metal shone reddish-yellow in the soft light of the\nwalls; detached pieces lay on the floor and in the car itself. Spud\nregarded it with amazement, but the wealth he was witnessing left him\ncold; another thought was forcing itself into his brain.\n\nThat thought took more definite form when another corridor took him to\nrooms where great metal cases were neatly stacked; other adjoining rooms\nheld strange machinery and appliances on metal stands.\n\n\"Lab'ratories!\" said the amazed man explosively. \"And storehouses, too!\nNeither angels nor devils did this; 'tis the work of men--and I know how\nto get along with men. I'll go find them. Belike they have saved the\nlad, Chet, and he'll be waitin' to see me.\"\n\nHe raced back along the corridor, but stopped short at its end, where he\nhad taken flight from the larger passage. There was sound of shrieking\nvoices, and Spud dropped to the floor to present as small a view as\npossible to the half-human things that trailed their black wings past\nthe metal entrance; then he crept cautiously to peer around the corner,\nwhen the last one had gone.\n\nThey were waiting out beyond; Spud watched them intently. They had great\nnets of rope in which were living things that struggled and writhed.\n\nHe saw one of the creatures stoop to break off a protruding end of\npinkish, nameless substance; the thing seemed to struggle in his hands\nwhile he took it to his mouth and munched on it. Even when Spud realized\nthat this living food was vegetation of some sort, he was still sickened\nwith the sight of its being taken alive into the bodies of these\nMoon-beasts.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne of the ugly figures raised a black-clawed hand to seize a lever let\nflush into the wall. It had been concealed. Spud saw the door open; saw\nthe waiting horde troop through, dragging their loaded nets; and he saw\nthe door close silently, while the actuating lever moved back to its\nformer position.\n\nAnd Spud, speaking half aloud, counted slowly to a hundred, then another\nhundred, as a gage of the time while he waited for those beyond the door\nto move on. But at the count of two hundred his eager hands were upon\nthe lever, while his eyes were hungry to stare beyond the opening door.\n\nThey found nothing but emptiness when the door swung wide. Another room\nof luminous walls; another door in the farther wall. The man moved\nslowly through the doorway one cautious step at a time and stared about.\n\nHe found a lever like the others, moved it--and saw the door close\nsilently behind him. Another lever was near the second door; he pulled\ncarefully, steadily, upon it.\n\nThere was no movement of the door, but something had occurred as he\nknew by the hissing sound that came from above his head. Its source he\ncould not find; its result was most startling. For, where before his\nsuit had bulged out roundly with the inner pressure of one atmosphere,\nit now became less taut--and it hung loosely about him when the hissing\nceased.\n\n\"An air-lock,\" said Spud joyfully, \"or I'm a rat-tailed imp myself! That\nmeans a heavier air-pressure inside. And now I know 'tis men folks I'm\ngoin' to see!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe lever moved easily now, and the second door swung open and closed\nbehind him as before. Spud tore recklessly at the fastening of his suit,\nregardless of the fact that an increased pressure might still come from\nsome gas that would mean death to a human. But, like Chet, he found the\nair fragrant and pure, and he rid himself of the encumbering suit,\nstrapped the pistols at his waist, rolled the suit to a bundle he could\nsling over one shoulder, and moved carefully as a cat as he went forward\nthrough a corridor that led down and still down.\n\nAs he went the empty labyrinth of halls filled him with a horrible\ndepression; yet there was beauty everywhere--beauty whose delicacy of\ncurve and color filled even the untrained mind of Spud O'Malley with a\nthrill of delight.\n\nThere were halls and vast rooms without number; there were carvings that\nglowed with a light of their own--figures so filled with the very spirit\nof livingness that they seemed stepping out from the cold walls to greet\nhim; there were more celestial hosts of purest white poised apparently\nin mid-flight.\n\nThere were marvelous, rioting waves of color that pulsed and throbbed\nthrough the walls and the very air of some rooms; and there were\narticles of furniture--carved tables, chairs--objects whose purpose\nSpud could not guess. But, except for the occasional sound of shrill,\nsqueaking voices in the distance, there was no sign of the presence of\nthe builders, the men Spud had hoped to find.\n\nAnd he knew at last that his quest was hopeless. The dust of uncounted\ncenturies that lay thickly upon all was evidence as convincing as it was\nmute.\n\n\"There's naught but the devils!\" Spud despaired. \"The others--saints be\nhelpin' of them!--have been gone for more years than a man dares think\nof. So, the devils it is; I'll follow them--I'll go where they are. But\nI'm not so sure at all of findin' the lad now.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat high-pitched chattering that had come to him at times was his only\nguide now. It seemed echoing in greater volume from one passage that\nslanted down more sharply than the rest. Spud followed it, clinging with\nhands and feet to the steep-pitched floor; but some sudden impulse\nseized him and compelled him to stop at intervals while he drew a pistol\nfrom his belt. Its grip was of steelite that rang sharply as a bell when\nhe struck it upon the walls. And he tapped out the general call of the\nService time after time; then strained his faculties in eager listening\nuntil he went hopelessly on.\n\nBut he repeated the call. \"For the lad may hear it and be heartened,\" he\nargued. \"And if he's free to do it he'll answer--though I think I'd\nbreak down and cry with joy did I hear an answerin' rap.\"\n\nAnd still the chattering grew louder, while the watching, creeping man\nmoved stealthily on. A wave of gas came to him once and set him choking,\nwhile far ahead he saw a reflected glow more red than the pale, lucent\nshimmering of the walls.\n\nHe stopped dead still as once more there flooded through him a thousand\nunnamed fears of this domain of the Evil One where he would trespass.\nBut he forced his feet to carry him on until he could peer down through\na rift in the rock floor to behold another room whose walls glowed redly\nwith the light of fires far down in hot-throated pits.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were figures whose white bodies shone as redly in that\nglow--figures that floated on outspread leather wings of dead black.\nSmall wonder that the mind of Spud O'Malley found here the confirmation\nof his worst fears; small wonder that his trembling lips whispered:\n\"'Tis Hell! 'Tis Hell, at last!\"\n\nBut there was that which froze his quivering nerves to cold quiet, which\nset his lips into a grim, straight line and held him motionless above\nthe opening from which he saw the room below--as, from a flurry of\nbodies against one far side, he saw a girl emerge.\n\nShe was in the hands of the black-winged beasts who carried her into the\nair then swung out toward the fiery pit. And Spud's incredulous: \"Oh,\nthe poor, beautiful darlin'!\" rose unconsciously to his lips to die away\nin a quick-drawn breath. For, from the mass of bodies, another figure\nwas tossed up into the air to be gripped by black, waiting claws--and\nSpud knew that he was seeing Chet Bullard, fighting, struggling, in the\ngrasp of these demons from the Pit.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe fumes from that inferno rose straight up. They passed out at another\nfunnel-shaped throat except for an occasional eddy that whirled back\ntoward the watching man. But Spud O'Malley, hanging precariously from\nthat opening above, knew nothing of the sulphurous fumes or of the\ntight band they clamped about his throat. He was taking careful aim at\nthe first of the flying beasts, found Chet in his line of fire, and\nsnapped forward his pistol to fire at the lip of the pit instead. And he\nslipped forward the continuous discharge lever that caused the pistol to\nshake in his hand as it emptied its capacious magazine in a furious rain\nof bullets whose every end was tipped with the deadliest explosive of\nEarth.\n\nThe floor rose up toward him in a spouting volcano of fire, while Spud\nglared wildly through glazed and blinded eyes and swung his pistol to\nrake the flying horde where he knew Chet was not.\n\nHe saw, through the haze that was sweeping before him, Chet's sprawled\nbody on the floor; he saw him leap to his feet and rush to the rescue of\nthe girl. Then the empty pistol slipped from Spud's nerveless hand; and\nhis other, that had clung with unshakable grip to a sharp edge of rock,\nrelaxed, while he plunged headlong toward the floor below.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n_One Stroke for Freedom_\n\n\nIn that subterranean chamber of the Moon, where the angry red of still\ndeeper fires flared fitfully; where winged demons, like evil creatures\nof a drug-crazed dreamer's mind, darted shrieking through the sulphurous\nair, it was a slender, blue-eyed girl who took control of events.\n\nShe it was who, when the explosions of detonite had ceased, saw the fall\nof a body from high above. She saw it strike upon a mound of dead\nMoon-beasts; saw the homely, human features as the body rolled to the\nfloor; and it was she who threw herself upon it protectingly when one of\nthe enemy wounded dragged his broken wings trailing across the stone\nthat he might reach that human face with his distended claws.\n\n\"A man!\" Anita Haldgren screamed. \"It's a man--help me!\" And Chet was\nbeside her in an instant to drag the limp body to safety.\n\n\"Spud!\" he shouted. \"It's Spud O'Malley! He never went back! He came\ndown here to save us!\"\n\nHe grabbed up the gun where it had fallen; saw the empty magazine; then\nflung himself down beside the unconscious figure of Spud while he tore\nat the fastenings of the second weapon.\n\n\"His suit!\" he shouted to the girl. \"Get his suit! It's there where he\nfell! Bring yours and mine, too!\"\n\nHe was hardly able to gage his own strength here where all weights were\none-sixth of their equivalent on Earth. He stooped and swung the chunky\nbody of Spud across his shoulder as easily as he would have lifted a\nchild. And, having done it, he was entirely at a loss as to where to go.\n\nAcross the great room was a throng of leaping, flapping things; more\nwere pouring in from open doors. Chet stood hesitant and bewildered,\nuntil Anita spoke.\n\n\"Come!\" she called, and darted toward a narrow entrance.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe clamorous shrieking from the horde of Moon-beasts marked their\nswooping assault upon the two, and Chet paused to send them three shots\nthat checked the advance. Then, with the body of Spud held tightly, he\nsprang where Anita had gone.\n\nShe was waiting, but gave Chet no chance to question her. \"Come!\" she\ncommanded again, and ran on as before. But, as Chet gained her side, she\noffered between gasping breaths an explanation.\n\n\"Five years they kept us ... like animals in a cage ... but there was a\nplace ... a sacred place ... they let us go there.... And they let us\nmake signal lights from outside ... they called it magic.\n\n\"And now Frithjof has escaped ... he will go to the sacred room ... only\nthere would he be safe....\"\n\nThey had turned and twisted through narrow passages. Anita, it seemed,\nwas plotting a course through less frequented thoroughfares of this\nstrange city. But they came at last to a vast auditorium into which they\npeered from a half-opened door.\n\nThe room was of preposterous size, and Chet marveled at the minds that\nhad conceived and wrought so tremendous an undertaking. And he saw\nplainly in his own mind the throngs of serene-faced beings who must have\nfolded their white wings softly about them to gather there for worship.\nBut more plainly still he saw the jostling, squealing crowd that was\nthere that instant before his eyes.\n\nHundreds of them--thousands, it might be--and the sound of their shrill\nvoices made hideous echoes from the high-flung ceiling of the great\nhall. The dry rustling of their leather wings was an unceasing rush of\nsound.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSome who seemed to be leaders stood above the rest on a platform which\nformed the base of a terraced formation against the far wall of the\nroom. Even at a distance Chet could see and wonder at the simple beauty\nof that place of metals and jewels where the great ones of an earlier\nrace had once stood.\n\nBack of those who harangued the crowd the terraces built themselves up\nto a pyramid against the rock wall; and on either side, opening upon\nthe platform base, was a doorway of noble proportions, whose metal doors\nof burnished reds and browns were closed.\n\n\"The sacred room,\" whispered Anita, \"beyond those doors. Frithjof has\nclosed them. He is there. I know it--I know it!\"\n\nChet was still holding the body of O'Malley. Only his choked breathing\nshowed that he still lived, but now he stirred and struggled in Chet's\ngrasp, while he struck out blindly and hoarse sounds came from his\nthroat.\n\nChet clapped one hand over the pilot's mouth. \"For the love of heaven,\nSpud,\" he said fiercely, \"be still! Don't speak--don't say a word! It's\nChet--Chet Bullard! I've got you, we're all right!\"\n\nThe pilot's struggles ceased, and Chet eased him to the floor where he\nsat still gasping for breath; the fumes from that place of death had\nbeen strangling in his throat.\n\nBeside him Chet heard the girl repeating in softest tones the name she\nhad heard for the first time.\n\n\"Chet--Chet Bullard! How odd a name! But I love it--I couldn't help but\nlove it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the great room were some who had turned toward the sound of Chet's\nscuffling; they were walking slowly toward the half-opened door.\n\n\"Come!\" said Anita Haldgren again, and fled like a slender,\ngolden-haired wraith down the narrow hall.\n\nMore twisting passages until Chet was hopelessly lost. But he no longer\nneeded to carry O'Malley, who was running beside him, and he had\nimplicit faith in the girlish guide who went before. He was not\nsurprised when they came after many detours to a narrow door of wrought\nmetals in white and gold, whose inset designs were worked in glowing\njewels.\n\nNor was he surprised when the door opened in response to a series of\nknocks from Anita's hand that spelled SOS in the code he knew, and a\nman, whose long hair and beard hung about a face as handsome as that of\na Viking of old, stood motionless in that doorway.\n\nBut the surprise of that flaxen-haired giant can be only imagined when a\nyoung man whom he had never seen on Earth or Moon stepped forward from\nhis sister's side with outstretched hand.\n\n\"I am Bullard,\" said the slim young man, \"Master Pilot of the World--or\nat least that was my rating up to the time I left in search of you. And\nnow, Pilot Haldgren, we've a ship outside, and, if you'd care to go back\nwith us--\"\n\nAnd with equal casualness the blond Viking replied: \"You came in search\nof us! You saw our signals! After all this time! Yes, we shall be glad\nto go back with--we shall be glad--yes--\"\n\nBut his deep, rumbling voice broke into something like a sob, and he\nturned with outstretched arms to stumble blindly toward his sister, who\nburied her face in his torn and ragged blouse.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You came in search of us--you came through space just to find and\nrescue us!\" Haldgren, it seemed, could not recover from the effects of\nthis unbelievable fact. He was gripping hard at the hand of Chet\nBullard, while his other great arm was thrown about the shoulders of\nSpud O'Malley.\n\n\"But now that you are here, what is to be done? Every exit will be\nguarded; we are shut off from the outer world by a hundred locked doors\nand by thousands of those beasts.\"\n\nHe took his arm from Spud's shoulder to point toward the great doors,\nbeyond which was a rising clamor of shrill sound.\n\n\"They will break in here soon; they would have been here before had they\nknown of the old lost entrance of the priests that Anita and I found.\nWe're as bad off as ever, I am afraid. There will be no holding them\nnow.\"\n\n\"I can hold some,\" said Chet, and touched his weapon. Haldgren nodded\nhis shaggy head.\n\n\"Some, but not many of the thousands we must face before ever we fight\nour way through to the outer world. No, my friend Bullard, that will\nnever save us; we are doomed!\"\n\nBut Chet, unwilling to accept or share the other's convictions, was\nseeing again the great room beyond those doors--a room of vast\nproportions; of high-arched, vaulted ceiling where sweeping curves all\ncentered and ended in one tremendous central point. It hung down, that\npoint, a blazing pendant--an inverted keystone; through some magic of\nthat ancient people all the colors of the spectrum had been made to ebb\nand flow like rainbows of living light.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut something deeper than the beauty of this had impressed Chet. A\nmaster pilot does not study design of structures, even structures meant\nfor travel through the air, without gaining knowledge of architectural\nfundamentals; his mind, subconsciously, had been following strains and\nstresses through those super-imposed curves. He turned abruptly to\nHaldgren with a question.\n\n\"It seemed to me when I was following Anita that we climbed upward; we\nwere always running upward through the passages. We must be near the\nsurface of the Moon; is that true?\"\n\nHaldgren nodded slowly. \"I think so--yes! In the great room out there\nare windows of quartz high in the ceiling. You could not see them from\nwhere you were, but they are there. I have seen them lighted; I think it\nwas the light of the sun.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said Chet quietly, \"I will ask you to open those doors.\"\n\n\"But they will come in!\" the big man protested.\n\n\"They will not come in.\"\n\nChet turned to the girl. \"I will ask you, my dear, to accompany me--if\nyou have faith.\"\n\nAnd, to that, Anita Haldgren granted not even a word of reply. She moved\nmore swiftly than her brother to a controlling lever in the wall ... and\nthe ponderous doors swung slowly back.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBeyond those opening doors a din of shrieks went abruptly still. They\nrose again in a squeaking babel of amazement and again were silenced as\nChet Bullard stepped through the arch. Beside him was the slender figure\nof Anita; following was a stocky man whose unhandsome, face was alight\nwith a broad grin.\n\n\"Go to it, my bhoy!\" Spud O'Malley was saying. \"I don't know what you're\nup to, but you'll be countin' me in--and here's hopin' you give those\ndevils hell!\"\n\nAnd, behind them all, in great strides that brought him up with the\nrest, came Haldgren, recovered now from the stupefaction that had held\nhim momentarily. The four went silently where Chet led to the highest\npoint of the great terraced rostrum.\n\nIt was a stepped pyramid, Chet found, split in half and the half placed\nagainst the wall. There was a stairway of smaller steps where priests,\nsome thousands of years before, had made their way to the top. And the\ndust of centuries arose in smoky puffs as the four trod that path where\nthe holy ones had gone. Below them the silence was ending in sibilant\nhissing calls as the black-winged beast-men watched that procession to\nthe heights. Some few had launched themselves into the air, Chet saw\nwhen he turned.\n\n\"Tell them to go back,\" he said to Anita; \"tell them to listen to what I\nhave to say!\" There followed immediately the sound of Anita's soft voice\ndistorted to shrill sounds that echoed throughout the hall.\n\n\"Tell them now,\" said Chet when the hall was still, \"that I have come\nfrom another world. Tell them that I hold the thunderbolts of their\nancient gods in my hands. Then tell them if they permit us to depart we\nwill go and leave them in peace. But if they try to harm us, the temple\nof their gods will be destroyed, and they, too, shall die. Tell them!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was something of unwonted solemnity in the voice of the master\npilot--something of quiet power and the dignity that became a messenger\nof the gods--as he gave his orders and faced the throng.\n\nAnd there was the patience of a god who is sickened of slaughter as he\nfaced the discordant din and the threatening forward surge of the demon\nthrong below. The girl had spoken, and the air was black with their\nthreshing wings, while still Chet waited with outstretched hand.\n\nTo the creatures below--the things half-men and half-beasts--the shining\ntube in that extended hand meant nothing of threat. And even to the\nIrish pilot, who stood silently watching, the gesture seemed futile.\n\n\"You've overplayed your hand, lad,\" he said in a tone of despair. \"'Tis\nno little gun like that will stop them now!\"\n\nHe was watching that hand and the shining tube; watching in amazement\nas he saw it swing slowly up toward the advancing horde risen level with\nthem in the air--up above their massed blackness of wings--on and up,\nuntil the tube was pointing toward the base of a carven pendant, whose\nblending colors were fairy lights at play.\n\nAnd still the weapon waited until the snarling faces of the enemy were\nclose. Then the pistol cracked once, and the roar of its exploding shell\ncame thundering after.\n\nFor an instant all motion ceased; the very wings of the flying beasts\nseemed frozen rigid in mid-flight. Then the whole of the vast room was\nin motion.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA rush of escaping air whirled upward the black-winged monsters in an\ninverted maelstrom of shrieking winds. And, falling to meet them, came\nan enormous pendant whose rioting colors seemed glorying in their own\ndeath. And with that came the swift disintegration of the vaulted arches\nwhere the one central supporting point of their intricate maze had been\nshattered; till, with a crashing avalanche of sound that obliterated the\nthundering echoes of the detonite charge, the entire ceiling, that\nseemed now like the roof of a mighty world, roared down to destruction.\n\nThe pyramidal rostrum was at one side. A cascade of shattered rock fell\nlike a curtain before it--a kindly curtain that hid from human sight the\nhideous slaughter of a demoniac mob. It was still falling; the\nimprisoned air was gathering added force to rush upward, screaming as if\nthe very winds were insane with joy at their release, when the great\narms of Frithjof Haldgren closed about the others of the group and half\ncarried them, half hurled them, down the slope.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe echoing clang of great doors was still with them as the bellowing\nvoice of Haldgren was heard.\n\n\"Get into your suits! The internal pressure is lost.\" Even as he spoke\nthe big man was clutching at his throat, though the closing doors of the\nsacred room had given them respite. \"Quick! They have emergency doors.\nThey will close them--but this part is cut off. In only minutes there\nwill be no air!\"\n\nBut it was Chet who snapped shut the closure of Anita Haldgren's suit\nbefore he pulled on his own. And he grinned happily through the glass of\nhis helmet as he saw the others safely encased, while their suits slowly\nbulged as the pressure of the air about them went down and their own\ntanks of oxygen took up the task of maintaining one atmosphere of\npressure.\n\nIn silence the great doors of the sacred room swung back; in silence, as\nbefore, the Earth-folk passed through where chaos had reigned. Chet\nchecked them; he threw one arm clumsily around the figure of Anita\nHaldgren while he turned to her brother.\n\n\"The door is open, Frithjof Haldgren,\" he said, and pointed upward at\nthe black vault of the heavens where a massive ceiling had been. In that\nimmensity of space, framed in the torn outlines of a shattered world,\nshone a great globe--a globe like a giant moon. The Earth, unbelievably\nbright, was beckoning them once more.\n\n\"The door is open,\" Chet repeated; \"do you still wish to go home?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n_\"Bullard, of the I.B.C.!\"_\n\n\nThe controls of a meteor ship held steady without the touch of the\npilot's hand. Chet Bullard was staring at a radiocone on the instrument\nboard in the control room where a voice from some super-powered station\nwas calling. His own radio had been crackling a call, and now this\nresponse was coming across the void.\n\n\"Orders from the Stratosphere Control Board: You will proceed at once to\nNew York. Radiobeacon 2X12 will guide you down. Your message received\nand we acknowledge report of the finding of the space-flyer, Pilot\nHaldgren. Do not discharge any passengers and land nowhere else than at\nNew York without direct orders of the Board. Keep your directional\nsignal on full power; our cruisers will pick you up in the highest\nlevel. Signed: Commander of Air.\"\n\nSpud O'Malley, it was, who broke the silence of the room where only the\nsound of the terrific exhaust came thinly through.\n\n\"May divils confound him! And it's back on the Moon with those other\nbeasts I'm wishin' I was. At least a man can get close enough to slam\nthem in their ugly faces; but the Commander and his cruisers! Sure,\nthere's nothin' we can do!\"\n\n\"Just take our medicine,\" said Chet Bullard quietly. \"But I have proved\nhim wrong; Haldgren, here, is the living evidence of that. And I said I\nwould laugh him from the Service--well, I'm not so sure of that.\"\n\n\"But surely,\" broke in Haldgren's booming voice, \"there will be only\npraise for what you have done. I do not understand--\"\n\n\"You don't know the Commander, my boy,\" Spud broke in dryly. \"And you\ndon't know that the lad, here, defied him to his face and ran the\ngantlet of his cruisers' guns to get away and go after you.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" grunted the giant. \"And now I understand. It is the old story--an\nincompetent man in a place of authority--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nChet broke in.\n\n\"Not quite right; this Commander of ours has done much--he is a driver\nof men--but there are some of us who think he lacks vision. He can never\nsee beyond the stratosphere he rules so ably; and his position is\nsupreme.\"\n\n\"There is still the Governing Council--we will appeal--\"\n\nBut the master pilot was not listening to Haldgren's words; his slim,\nsensitive hand was reaching for the ball-control to build up still more\nthe tremendous blast of a forward exhaust that was checking their speed\nand making them as heavy as if their bodies were of meteoric iron.\n\nA forward lookout showed a black globe; its circle was rimmed with fire\nfrom the Sun that it blotted out. A hemisphere of night lay below--the\nblack, mysterious night of a waiting Earth. But one strong signal came\nin on the instruments at Chet's side to show him where on that horizon\nwas New York; and the call of a flagship of cruisers was flashing before\nhim as the lift of the Repelling Area was felt.\n\n\"Follow!\" flashed the order. \"You will follow to New York!\" And, through\nthe black night, faint flashes of light marked the fleet of swift\nguardians of the skies that closed in, then swept downward and out--an\nimpregnable convoy about the speeding, roaring ship.\n\nAnd there was that in Chet's face as he handled the controls that\nbrought Anita Haldgren to his side that she might lift his free hand in\nwordless comfort and press it to her face.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat venerable and beloved man, the President of the Federation\nAeronautique Internationale, stood silent before a vast audience.\nThroughout the great auditorium was silence; each of the gathered\nthousands was listening to the shrieking sirens from the landing field\non the roof overhead.\n\nSkylights above showed the night air ablaze with red, through which the\nvivid green of landing signals pierced in staccato bursts. From the roof\nof that building to the highest level of the stratosphere the air was\ncleared; no craft of the Service would venture to pierce the barrage of\nlight and radio waves that hemmed that aerial shaft. And down the shaft,\nin a thunder of roaring exhausts, came a shining shape.\n\nShe sparkled and flashed in the crimson and green of that emergency\nlight, and from her bow poured a tornado that blasted the air, then\nstreamed out behind in hot gas like a comet of flame. Then the thunders\ndied; the shining shape turned once slowly in air to show her blunt nose\nand cylindrical body before she settled softly as a homing bird to the\nembrace of great waiting arms of steel. And, inside the building, a\nwhite-haired man was saying:\n\n\"They are here! Thank God, they are here! Their radio has prepared us;\nour signals have guided them home. And now it is not New York, nor even\nthe United States of America alone who attends; the whole world will be\nsummoned. Look!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBehind, and high above him on a wall, was a radio panel. Its signal\nlamps went suddenly dark. The thin, blue-veined hand of the speaker was\npointing.\n\n\"Only twice has the world-call flashed: once when the Molemen came and\nthe future of the world was at stake; once when the Dark Moon crashed\ndown from the void and the serpents of space menaced aerial traffic. And\nnow--once again!--the whole world is summoned! Every city and hamlet of\nEarth--every ship of the air and the sea--every vessel on the ocean,\nunder the ocean, and in the air levels above--\"\n\nHis voice broke sharply. From the panel there came a thin call, a\nquivering that was more a trembling than a sound; it reached out to\ntouch raspingly the nerves of every listener. Then the whole board burst\nforth in a flash of fire where a flaming crystal leaped to life--and\nnone could see that pulsing flame without thrilling to the knowledge\nthat it was calling a whole world with its wordless summons.\n\nThe light died; a television detector whined as its motors came to\nspeed; and each watcher knew that the waiting world was connected with\nthat auditorium in New York; all that happened, there--each sight and\nsound--was circling the globe.\n\nAn announcer's voice roared briefly before the regulator cut down on its\nvolume.\n\n\"You are seeing the Radio-central Auditorium in New York. On the landing\nstage above, after a journey of five hundred thousand miles, a strange\ncraft has settled to rest. Its pilot: Chester Bullard, once rated as\nMaster Pilot of the World! Its journey, now safely completed: from the\nEarth to the Moon, and return!\n\n\"The world is waiting to greet Pilot Bullard, though of this he, as yet,\nis unaware. World-wide radio control is now transferred to Radio-central\nAuditorium in New York! They are coming! They are entering!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut the thousands gathered in that great hall heard no other words from\nthe radiocone. Their attention was focused upon the broad stage, where,\ndescending from a lift, a strange group stepped out upon the stage,\nstood an instant in startled wonder that was near embarrassment, then\ntook the seats to which they were shown.\n\nAnd again the venerable President of the Federation Aeronautique\nInternationale was speaking.\n\n\"It is less than a month since I stood here before you, when, as again\nis true to-night, the entire personnel of the executives of the\nStratosphere Control Board was gathered to do honor to the pioneers of\nspace--the discoverer--\"\n\nOn the stage near the speaker, Chet Bullard stared in consternation at a\ngirl in a pilot's suit as grimed and ragged as his own. His gaze passed\non to the set features of Pilot O'Malley--to the blue eyes of a\nflaxen-haired giant--then on to where Walt Harkness and Diane, his wife,\nsat regarding him with happy smiles. Dimly Chet heard the man at the\nspeakers' stand.\n\n\"--and on that other occasion, Mr. Bullard refused a decoration tendered\nhim and marking him as the first to travel through airless space.\n\n\"I have here\"--the speaker smiled slightly as he extended his hand where\na jewel flashed fire from a velvet case--\"the identical jewel and medal.\nAnd to-night, while the peoples of Earth are gathered throughout the\nworld to do honor to Mr. Bullard, it has been given to me the proud\nprivilege of welcoming him home.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe turned and held out a beckoning hand toward Chet. In a daze the\nyounger man arose and moved beside the one who had called him.\n\n\"And now, Chester Bullard, on behalf of the Governing Council of the\nRuling Nations of this Earth, I greet you: Pilot of the Stratosphere no\nlonger--but Pilot of Endless Space! The world welcomes you; and, through\nme, it places in your hands this jewel.\n\n\"But you will observe that we older ones may still learn, and we do not\nrepeat our former mistake. We hand you this medal, emblematic of the\nfirst penetration of space, to do with as you will.\"\n\nThe thin hand was shaking as the speaker turned and swept the audience\nwith one all-inclusive gesture.\n\n\"To you who are before me now; to you out beyond wherever parallels of\nlongitude and latitude are known--I present the Columbus of the\nStars!--Chester Bullard!\"\n\nAnd suddenly Chet found himself alone in a pandemonium of sound. From\nthe countless faces that blurred into one unrecognizable sea came a roar\nof human voices like waves thundering against storm-worn cliffs; above\nthe clamor was the sound of shrieking sirens; and through all, when it\nseemed that no other sound could be heard, came the full-volume,\nnerve-stunning clangor from the radiocone's wide-opened throat as the\ntrumpets and brass of all the monster bands of Earth broke forth, under\nradio control, in one synchronous song--till even that was drowned under\nthe roaring welcomes in strange tongues as the nations of Earth cut in.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd Chet Bullard, his blouse still torn where a Commander of Air had\nripped off a three-starred emblem of a Master Pilot, shook his blond\nhead to clear it of the confusion that seemed beating him down. And he\nstared and stared, not at the rioting throng before him, but at\nsomething he could in part comprehend--a glowing, flashing jewel that\nrested in his hand. And slowly there crept into his eyes a look of\nunderstanding, while a ghost of a smile twitched and tugged at the\ncorners of his mouth.\n\nThe hall, which one instant was a bedlam of roaring voices, went silent\nas Chet Bullard raised his hand. He was still smiling as he bowed toward\nthe white-haired man whose happy face belied the moisture in his eyes;\nthen he faced the throng, and his voice held no hint of trembling or\nuncertainty.\n\n\"The Columbus of the Stars! I thank you for that title, which I can\naccept only most humbly. For I ask you to go back with me into history\nand remember, as I am remembering, that before Columbus there were\nothers whose names are lost.\n\n\"The Norsemen--those Vikings of old!--who dared the unknown seas, were\nfirst. And again history repeats. But this time the pioneer will not\nremain unknown. I have been to the Moon; I have reached out into\nspace--but I followed another's trail.\n\n\"Frithjof Haldgren!\" he shouted, and extended a hand toward the gentle\ngiant whose face was aflame as he came to Chet's side. \"Frithjof\nHaldgren, I present you to the world. Only one can be the first; and\nyours is the honor and glory. This medal is yours alone; I place it\nwhere it belongs!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd Frithjof Haldgren, white of face and lips now instead of fiery red,\nstood silent and trembling while Chet fastened a jewel upon his grimy\ntattered blouse; then retired to his chair as if beaten back by the\nrolling waves of sound.\n\nBut to Chet, as he watched the man go, came a quick sense of\ndisappointment. Unconsciously, his hand went to the same place on his\nown chest where had rested an emblem he had prized above all else--and\nnow his searching fingers found only the mark of his disgrace. Then he\nknew again that the aged President was speaking, while he held Chet\nbeside him with one detaining hand.\n\n\"We older ones have served, perhaps; we have done what we could; we pray\nthat the world is better for our efforts! And we shall continue to\nserve; yet it is to youth that we must look for the progress which is to\ncome.\n\n\"Today we face a new life whose horizons, once bounded by the limiting\nair, have been pushed back. We have conquered space, and before us is\nthe waiting marvel of man's extension of his activities throughout the\nuniverse.\n\n\"How far shall we go in this new and endless sphere? With interplanetary\ntravel, what is our goal? Only youth can give the answer. And in the\nhands of youth must the command of this great adventure be placed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Gentlemen, the Governing Council of the Ruling Nations of this Earth\nhas created a new command. By the acts of this man who stands beside me,\nand by his fellow-explorer, Walter Harkness, the Council has been forced\nto take this step.\n\n\"That command will rank second only to the Governing Council itself; a\nbody of men shall compose it who shall be known as the Interstellar\nBoard of Control.\" He turned squarely toward Chet. \"I am placing in\nyour hands, Mr. Bullard, your commission as Commander of that Board. The\nbest minds of all nations will be at your call. Will you accept--will\nyou gather these men about you and do your part in this great work for\nthe greater future of mankind?\"\n\nThe ears of a listening world waited long for an answer. But the eyes of\nthat world saw a figure whose blond head was suddenly lowered as if to\nhide a betrayal of what was in his heart; they saw him raise his bowed\nhead to stare mutely toward a girl whose eyes of blue were swimming with\nhappy tears as she gave him a trembling smile--and only then did they\nsee Chet Bullard draw himself erect, while his voice went out with the\nspeed of light to a waiting world.\n\n\"I accept, Mr. President. Proudly--humbly--I accept!\"\n\nAnd the eyes of the world, if they were understanding eyes, must have\nsmiled with his, as the Commander of the Interstellar Board of Control\ngrasped, among others, the congratulatory hand of his subordinate, the\nCommander of Air.\n\nBut if there were any who expected to read mockery in those smiling\neyes, they had yet to learn the measure of Commander Bullard--\"Bullard,\nof the I.B.C.!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Finding of Haldgren, by Charles Willard Diffin\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE FINDING OF HALDGREN ***\n\n***** This file should be named 29717.txt or 29717.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/9/7/1/29717/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Graeme Mackreth and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
