He would do far\nbetter, Oliver realized finally, to resign himself to the quiet\nsuburban life of Landsdale, Florida, and to perpetuate the Watts line\nby marrying some worthy and practical local girl. The quiet life, it\ndeveloped, was that of a D. V. M.; the worthy and practical girl, Miss\nOrella Simms of Tampa, to whom he was now engaged.\n\nTo put it plainly, Oliver was until the moment of his Great\nOpportunity a good-humored stooge with a cowlick and a sense of\nresponsibility, whose invariable cue was family obligation and whose\ncrowning virtue was docility. He was maneuvered into becoming a D. V.\nM. (though to tell the truth the profession suited him well enough,\nbeing the nearest possible approach to realizing his ambition) solely\nbecause the veterinary college in Tampa was near enough to Landsdale\nfor commuting and because his later practice could be carried on under\nthe guiding aegis of his personal matriarchy. The virtuous, and vapid,\nOrella Simms became his fiancee by the same tactics and for the same\nreasons.\n\nOliver _had_ considered rebellion, of course, but common sense\ndiscouraged the idea. He had no intimates outside his family nor any\nexperience with the world beyond Landsdale and Tampa, and his\nfledgling self-confidence invariably bogged down in a welter of\nintrospective apprehensions when he thought of running away. Where\nwould he go, and to whom could he turn in emergency?\n\nSuch was the character and condition of Oliver Watts when his newly\nundertaken practice of veterinary medicine threw him into the company\nof \"Mr. Thomas Furnay\" and of a girl whose name, as nearly as it can\nbe rendered into English, was Perrl-high-C-trill-and-A-above. Their\nadvent brought Oliver face to face for the first time in his sedentary\nlife with High Adventure--with adventure so high, as a matter of fact,\nthat it took him literally and bodily out of this humdrum world.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe initial step was taken when Mr. Furnay, known to Landsdale as a\nwealthy and eccentric old recluse who had recently leased a walled\nproperty on Federal Route 27 that had once been the winter retreat of\na Prohibition-era gangster, was driven by emergency to call upon\nOliver for professional service. Mr. Furnay usually kept very much to\nhimself behind his iron-grilled gates and his miles of stuccoed wall;\nbut it happened that in pursuit of his business (whose true nature\nwould have confounded Landsdale to its insular core) he had just\nbought up the entire menagerie of an expiring circus billed as\nSkadarian Brothers, and it was the sudden illness of one of his newly\nacquired animals that forced him to breach his isolation.\n\nMr. Furnay called at the Watts place in his town car, driven by a\nsmall, dark and taciturn chauffeur named Bivins. He found Oliver at\nwork in his neatly ordered clinic at the rear of the big house, busily\nspooning cod-liver oil into a trussed and thoroughly outraged chow\nnamed Champ.\n\n\"I have a sick animal,\" Mr. Furnay stated tersely. He was a slight man\nwith a moderately long and wrinkled face, a Panama hat two sizes too\nlarge and a voice that had, in spite of its excellent diction, a\njarring timbre and definitely foreign flavor.\n\nOliver blinked, surprised and a little dismayed that Fate should have\nsent him so early in his career a known and patently captious\nmillionaire. Bivins, waiting in visored and putteed impassivity to\nreopen the door for his master, was silently impressive; the town car,\nparked on the crushed shell driveway outside, glittered splendidly in\nthe late afternoon sunshine.\n\n\"I'll be happy to call later in the day,\" Oliver said. He removed the\npadded block that had held Champ's jaws apart, and narrowly missed\nlosing a finger as the infuriated chow snapped at his hand. \"My aunt\nand sister are bringing my fiancee down from Tampa for dinner this\nevening, and I can't leave the clinic until they get here. Someone\nmight call for his pet.\"\n\nMr. Furnay protested his extremity of need. \"The animal suffers\nperiodic convulsions,\" he said. \"It may be dangerously ill!\"\n\nOliver unstrapped Champ from his detention frame and dodged with\npracticed skill when the chow tried to bite him on the thigh. He had\ntaken it for granted--having heard none of the gossip concerning Mr.\nFurnay's recent purchase of the Skadarian Brothers' menagerie--that\nthe sick animal in question was a dog or cat or perhaps a saddle\nhorse, and the bald description of its symptoms startled him more than\nChamp's predictable bid for revenge.\n\n\"Convulsions? What sort of animal is it, Mr. Furnay?\"\n\n\"A polar bear,\" said Mr. Furnay.\n\n\"Polar bear!\" echoed Oliver, and in his shock of surprise he dropped a\ndetaining strap and let Champ loose.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe dog sprang across the room--without a breath of warning, as chows\nwill--and bit Bivins on the leg just above his puttee. The chauffeur\nscreamed in a high and peculiarly raucous voice and jerked away,\njabbering in a vowelless and totally unfamiliar foreign tongue. Mr.\nFurnay said something sharply in the same grating language; Bivins\nwhipped out a handkerchief, pressed it over the tear in his whipcords\nand went quickly out to the car.\n\nOliver collared the snarling Champ and returned him to his cage, where\nthe dog pressed bristling against the bars and stared at Mr. Furnay\nhungrily with wicked, muddy eyes.\n\nMr. Furnay's shocked voice said, behind Oliver, \"What a ghastly world,\nwhere even the _pets_....\"\n\nHe broke off sharply as Oliver turned from the cage.\n\n\"I'm truly sorry, Mr. Furnay,\" Oliver apologized. \"If there's anything\nI can do ... a dressing for Bivins' leg--\"\n\nMr. Furnay gathered himself with an effort. \"It is nothing, a scratch\nthat will heal quickly. But my bear--you will come to see him at\nonce?\"\n\nAt another time, the thought of absenting himself without due notice\nto his Aunt Katisha and Glenna would have prompted Oliver to refuse;\nbut the present moment called more for diplomacy than for convention.\nBetter to suffer matriarchal displeasure, he thought, than to risk a\ndamage suit by a millionaire.\n\n\"I'll come at once,\" Oliver said. \"I owe you that, I think, after the\nfright Champ gave you.\"\n\nAnd, belatedly, the realization that he might handle a bear--a great,\nlive, lumbering bear!--surged up inside him to titillate his old\nboyhood yearning. Perhaps it was as well that his aunt and sister were\naway; this chance to exercise his natural skill at dealing with\nanimals was too precious to decline.\n\n\"Of course I won't guarantee a cure,\" Oliver said, qualifying his\npromise, \"because I've never diagnosed such a case. But I think I can\nhelp your bear.\"\n\nOddly enough, he _was_ almost sure that he could. Oliver, in his\nyounger days, had read a great deal on the care and treatment of\ncircus animals, and the symptoms in this instance had a familiar\nsound. Mr. Furnay's bear, he thought, in all probability had worms.\n\nThe Furnay town car purred away, leaving Oliver to marvel at his own\ndaring while he collected the instruments and medicines he might need.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nIn leaving the clinic he noted that Mr. Furnay's chauffeur had\ndropped his handkerchief at the doorway in his hurry to be gone--but\nOliver by this time was in too great a hurry to stop and retrieve it.\n\nHis Aunt Katisha might spoil the whole adventure on the instant with a\ntelephone call from Tampa. Bivins could wait.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe drive, after a day spent in the antiseptic confines of his clinic,\nwas like a holiday jaunt.\n\nThe late June sun was hot and bright, the rows of suburban houses trim\nand clean as scrubbed children sunning themselves among color-splashed\ncrotons and hibiscus and flaming poincianas. Oliver whistled gaily as\nhe turned his little white-paneled call truck off the highway and\ndrove between twin ranks of shedding cabbage palms toward the iron\ngates of the Furnay estate.\n\nA uniformed gateman who might have been a twin to Bivins admitted him,\npointing out a rambling white building that lay behind the stuccoed\nmansion, and shut the gate. Oliver parked his truck before the\nmenagerie building--it had been a stable in the heyday of the\nProhibition-era gangster, when it had held horses or cases of\ncontraband as occasion demanded--and found Bivins waiting for him.\n\nBivins, looking upset and sullen in immaculate new whipcords, opened\nthe sliding doors without a word.\n\nThe vast inside of the remodeled stable was adequately lighted by\nroof-windows and fluorescent bulbs, but seemed dark for the moment\nafter the glare of sun outside; there was a smell, familiar to every\ncircus-goer, of damp straw and animal dung, and a restless background\nstir of purring and growling and pacing.\n\nOliver gaped when his eyes dilated enough to show him the real extent\nof Mr. Furnay's menagerie holdings. At the north end of the building\ntwo towering Indian elephants swayed on picket, munching hay and\nshuffling monotonously on padded, ponderous feet. A roped-off\nenclosure held half a dozen giraffes which nibbled in aristocratic\ndeprecation at feed-bins bracketed high on the walls; and beyond them\nthree disdainful camels lay on untidily folded legs, sneering glassily\nat the world and at each other.\n\nThe east and west sides of the building were lined with rank after\nrank of cages holding a staggering miscellany of predators:\ngreat-maned lions with their sleek green-eyed mistresses; restless\ntigers undulating their stripes back and forth and grinning in sly,\ntusky boredom; chattering monkeys and chimpanzees; leopards and\ncheetahs and a pair of surly black jaguars whose claw-scored hides\nindicated either a recent difference of opinion or a burst of conjugal\naffection.\n\nThe south end of the vast room had been recently partitioned off, with\na single heavy door breaking the new wall at its center. On either\nside of this door the bears held sway: shaggy grizzlies, black bears,\ncinnamon and brown; spectacled Andeans and sleek white polars padding\nsilently on tufted feet.\n\nThe sick bear sulked in a cage to himself, humped in an oddly doglike\npose with his great head hanging disconsolately.\n\nOliver sized up the situation, casting back to past reading for the\nproper procedure.\n\n\"I'll need a squeeze-cage and a couple of cage boys to help immobilize\nthe brute,\" he said. \"Will you--\"\n\nHe was startled, in turning, to find that Bivins had not accompanied\nhim into the building. He was not alone, however. The door at the\ncenter of the partitioning wall had opened while he spoke, and a\nslender blonde girl in the briefest of white sunsuits was looking at\nhim.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nApparently she had not expected Oliver, for there was open interest in\nher clear green eyes. She said something in a clear and musical--but\ncompletely unintelligible--voice that ranged, with a remarkably\noperatic effect, through two full octaves.\n\nOliver stared. \"I'm here to doctor the sick bear,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, a _native_,\" the girl said in English.\n\nObviously she was trying to keep her voice within the tonal range of\nhis own, but in spite of the effort it trilled distractingly up and\ndown the scale in a fashion that left Oliver smitten with a sudden and\nunfamiliar weakness of the knees.\n\n\"May I help?\" she said.\n\nShe might, Oliver replied. She could have had as readily, he might\nhave added, a pint of his blood.\n\nMany times while they worked, finding a suitable squeeze-cage and\ndragging it against the bear's larger cage so that the two doors\ncoincided, Oliver found the prim and reproachful image of Miss Orella\nSimms rising to remind him of his obligations; but for the first time\nin his life an obligation was surprisingly easy to dismiss. His\nassistant's lively conversation, which was largely uninformative\nthough fascinatingly musical, bemused him even to the point of\nshrugging off his Aunt Katisha's certain disapproval.\n\nThe young lady, it seemed, came from a foreign country whose name was\nutterly unpronounceable; Oliver gathered that she had not been long\nwith Mr. Furnay, who was of another nationality, and that she was\nhomesick for her native land--for its \"saffron sun on turquoise hills\nand umber sea,\" which could only be poetic exaggeration or simple\nunfamiliarity with color terms of a newly learned language--and that\nshe was as a consequence very lonely.\n\nShe was, incredibly, a trainer of animals.\n\n\"Not of such snarling fierce ones as yours,\" she said, with a little\nshiver for the polar bear watching them sullenly through the bars,\n\"but of my own gentle beasts, who are friends.\"\n\nHer name was a startling combination of soprano sounds that might have\nbeen written as Perrl-high-C-trill-and-A-above, but which Oliver was\ncompletely unable to manage.\n\n\"Would you mind,\" he asked, greatly daring, \"if I called you Pearl\ninstead?\"\n\nShe would not. But apparently Mr. Furnay would.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe millionaire, who had entered the menagerie unheard, spoke sternly\nto the girl in his own raucous tongue and pointed a peremptory finger\ntoward the door through which she had come. The girl murmured \"_Ai\ndocssain, Tsammai_,\" in a disappointed tone, gave Oliver a smile that\nwould have stunned a harem guard, and disappeared again into her own\nterritory.\n\nOliver, being neither Chesterfield nor eunuch, was left with the giddy\nsensation of a man struggling to regain his balance after a sudden\nearth temblor.\n\nHis client reoriented him brusquely, \"Treat my bear,\" Mr. Furnay said.\n\n\"I've been waiting for help,\" Oliver said defensively. \"If you'll send\naround your menagerie manager and a cage boy or two--\"\n\n\"I have none,\" Mr. Furnay said shortly. \"There are only the four of us\nhere, and not one will approach within touching distance of a brute so\nvicious.\"\n\nOliver stared at him in astonishment.... Four of them meant only\nBivins, the gateman, the lovely blonde creature who called herself\nPerrl-high-C-trill-and-A-above and Mr. Furnay himself.\n\n\"But four inexperienced people can't possibly look after a menagerie\nof this size!\" Oliver protested. \"Circus animals aren't house pets,\nMr. Furnay--they're restless and temperamental, and they need expert\ncare. They bite and claw each other--\"\n\n\"There will be more of us later,\" Mr. Furnay said morosely, \"but I\ndoubt that numbers will help. We had not anticipated a ferocity so\nappalling, and I fear that my error may have proved the ruin of an\nexpensive project. The native beasts were never so fierce on other--\"\n\nHe broke off. \"I am sorry. You will have to manage as best you can\nalone.\"\n\nAnd he left the menagerie without looking back.\n\nTo deal tersely with subsequent detail, Oliver did manage alone--after\na fashion and up to a point. It was a simple matter, once he found a\nfour-foot length of conveniently loose board, to prod the unhappy bear\nfrom his larger prison to the smaller. The process of immobilizing the\nbrute by winching the squeeze-cage tight was elementary.\n\nBut in his casting-back Oliver had overlooked two vitally important\nprecautions: he'd forgotten to secure the gear fastenings, and he'd\nneglected to rope the smaller cage to the larger.\n\nThe bear, startled by the prick of the needle when Oliver gave him a\nsizable injection of nembutal, reacted with a frantic struggling that\nreversed the action of the unsecured winch and forced the two cages\napart. The door burst open, sprung by the sudden pressure.\n\nThe bear stood free.\n\nA considerable amount of legitimate excitement could be injected into\nsuch a moment by reporting that the bear, at last in a position to\nrevenge itself for past indignities, leaped upon its tormentor with a\nblood-freezing roar and that Oliver, a fragile pygmy before that\nnear-ton of slavering fury, escaped only by a hair or was annihilated\non the spot.\n\nNeither circumstance developed, however, for the reason that the bear\nwas already feeling the effects of the anesthetic given it and wanted\nnothing so much as a cool dark place where it might collapse in\nprivacy. And Oliver, caught completely off guard, was too stunned by\nthe suddenness of catastrophe to realize his own possible danger.\n\nWhat did happen was that Perrl-high-C-trill-and-A-above chose that\nparticular moment to open her door again and look out.\n\nHer fortuitous timing altered the situation on the instant; the bear,\nbent only on escape and seeing comparative gloom beyond the door,\ncharged not at Oliver but through the opening. And Oliver, still too\nconfused to think past the necessity of retrieving his error, ran\nafter it, brandishing his length of board and shouting wildly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe smaller area beyond the partition was dimly lighted, but to judge\nby its straw-covered floor and faint animal smell was evidently a\nspecial division of Mr. Furnay's menagerie. The light was too dim and\nthe emergency too great to permit Oliver more than a brief and\nincredulous glimpse of the improbable beast placidly munching hay in a\ncorner; his whole attention was centered first on the fleeing bear and\nthen upon the prostrate form of Perrl-high-C-trill-and-A-above, who\nhad been violently bowled over by the bear's rush.\n\n\"Pearl!\" yelled Oliver, petrified with horror.\n\nThe bear stood swaying upright over her, threshing its tufted forepaws\nfor balance and showing yellow tusks in a grimace that stemmed from\ndrugged weakness but which passed quite creditably for a snarl of\ndemoniac fury.\n\nObviously something had to be done. Oliver, galvanized by the\nrealization, came to the rescue with a promptness that amounted to\nreflex action.\n\n\"Down, boy!\" he said, and dealt the bear a sharp blow across the\nmuzzle with his board.\n\nThe bear dealt Oliver a roundhouse clout in return that stretched him\nhalf-conscious beside Perrl-high-C-trill-and-A-above. Then, at\nprecisely that moment of greatest dramatic impact, it shook its head\ndizzily and passed out cold.\n\nThe girl scrambled up and knelt beside Oliver to listen to his\nheartbeat, found that he was alive and raised her voice in an urgent\narpeggio that held in spite of its operatic timbre a distinct note of\ncommand.\n\nIn answer to her call the great beast in the corner--built something\non the order of a hippopotamus but with unorthodox variations in that\nit boasted six legs to either side and was covered with close-curling,\nbright blue wool--trotted out of the shadows and scooped up the\nunconscious bear in its four powerful anterior arms.\n\nA word from Perrl-high-C-trill-and-A-above sent it into the main\nmenagerie quarters, where it stuffed the limp bear into its old cage\nand trotted back to its mistress with a look of adoring deference on\nits round face.\n\nThe girl gave the creature a random trill of commendation and,\ndisplaying surprising strength for one so slight, herself dragged the\nreviving Oliver back to the scene of his unfinished diagnosis. The\norder given her earlier by Mr. Furnay was not forgotten, however, for\nshe did not linger.\n\n\"Not handsome, no,\" she murmured, locking the partition door behind\nher this time. \"But O Personal Deity of Unmarried Maidens, such\nheadlong bravery!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOliver roused ten minutes later to find himself alone with a memory of\nnightmare and a sleeping bear that offered no resistance whatever when\nhe funneled a quantity of tetrachlorethylene down its throat.\n\nHe was still alone an hour later--and still trying dizzily to separate\nfact from fancy, having tried the partition door and found it\nlocked--when the bear returned to semi-consciousness and submitted\ngroggily to a follow-up dosage of purgative.\n\nOliver would have liked to stay long enough to learn the results of\nhis diagnosis and to see Perrl-high-C-trill-and-A-above if she should\nreappear, but a glance at his watch electrified him with the\nrealization that he had been away from his clinic for more than two\nhours and that his Aunt Katisha and Glenna might by now have the state\npolice beating the palmetto flats for his body. Accordingly he left\nthe Furnay estate in a great hurry, pausing at the gate only long\nenough to leave word for Mr. Furnay that he would ring later in the\nevening to check his patient's progress.\n\nIt was not until he had returned home and found his Aunt Katisha still\nout that his overworked nerves, punished outrageously by shock,\nviolence and confusion, composed themselves enough to permit him a\nreasonable guess as to what actually had happened--and by that time\nhis conclusions had taken a turn so fantastically improbable that he\nwas lost again in a hopeless muddle of surmise.\n\nHe poured himself a glass of milk in the kitchen (he preferred coffee,\nbut his Aunt Katisha frowned on the habit) and took his grisly\nsuspicions down to the clinic, where he felt more at ease than in the\nantimacassared austerity of the house. There he mulled them over\nagain, and time was able to weave into the pattern the disjointed\nimpressions carried over from his period of semi-consciousness and\ndismissed until now as nightmare figments from the delirium of shock.\nTheir alignment with other evidence increased his conviction:\n\nMr. Furnay and M\u00e9nage, Oliver concluded with a cold thrill of horror,\nwere not human beings at all but monsters.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe pattern became even more disturbing when he considered various\nstories of local saucer-sightings and fireballs, which linked\nthemselves with chilling germanity to the events of the day.\n\nFirst there had been Champ's instant distrust of Mr. Furnay and\nBivins, and his attempt to rout them for the aliens they were. There\nhad been Bivins' anomalous scream when bitten--a raucous sound\ncertainly not human--and Mr. Furnay's grittily inconsonant order,\nspoken in no identifiable earthly tongue. The isolation of the Furnay\nestate took on a sinister and significant logic, as did its\nunderstaffed condition; there was the evident but baffling reluctance\nof Mr. Furnay and his myrmidons (with the notable exception of the\ngolden-voiced Pearl) to approach even safely caged beasts, and the\ngreater mystery of why a man so terrified of wild animals should have\nbought a menagerie in the first place.\n\nConsidering the part played by Perrl-high-C-trill-and-A-above in a\nscheme of things so fantastic left Oliver more disturbed than ever,\nbut for a different reason. That she was unarguably as alien as the\nothers made her equally mysterious, but connoted no share in whatever\ndevious plot occupied the Furnay faction; a reexamination of Mr.\nFurnay's harshly dictatorial attitude toward her, coupled with\nOliver's own uncertain memory of the moment when the girl had come to\nhis rescue, convinced him that she was not ipso facto a member of the\nextraterrestrial cabal but was its prisoner instead.\n\nVisualizing the probable fate of a beautiful girl held captive by\naliens--and forced by them to train outlandish, half-remembered brutes\nlike the one behind the partition--rather strained Oliver's talent for\nsurmise, but at the same time moved him to the uneasy conviction that\nit was his duty to rescue her in turn.\n\nThe thought that he might already be too late appalled him. The\nslender blonde beauty of Perrl-high-C-trill-and-A-above was\ndistractingly fresh in his mind, the eager arpeggiation of her voice\nan indelible memory. Recalling the smile she had given him in parting\nstirred an internal warmth unguessed at before, an emotional ignition\ncertainly never kindled by his fiancee or family.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOrella Simms, Glenna, his Aunt Katisha!\n\nThought of his obligations brought him back to reality with a jar; the\nappalling gulf between fact and fancy made clear to him with sudden\nand shocking clarity the nonentity's role that had been played, and\nmust be played, all his life by Oliver Watts.\n\nHe was the perennial romantic introvert, dreaming impossible dreams\ncompounded of escape reading and frustration, grasping timorously at\nany thread of adventure that might lead him to forget for the moment\nthe drab monotone of his existence. His mouth twisted wryly. There\nwas, of course, no fantastic alien plot incubating on the Furnay\nestate, no sunsuited damsel in distress awaiting rescue at his inept\nhands. He'd imagined the romantic aspects of the episode--the\n\"unearthly\" tongue, the improbable beast. No one required, or ever\nwould require, anything of Oliver Watts except his Aunt Katisha and\nGlenna, who demanded obedience, and Orella Simms, who expected\nconformity.\n\nAs if on cue, the Watts family car swung off the highway and rolled\ndown the crushed shell driveway past the clinic. Oliver's Aunt Katisha\ngot out, leaving Glenna and Orella Simms to wait, and strode into the\nclinic office.\n\n\"I see you've managed to spoil another one,\" she said acidly, pausing\nlong enough to retrieve the handkerchief Mr. Furnay's chauffeur had\nlost earlier. \"Moreover, I called twice this afternoon and found you\ngone. Where?\"\n\nOliver, as usual, weathered the storm in silence. Somewhere near the\nend he managed to squeeze in the information that he had treated a\nsick animal at the Furnay place--a saddle horse, he said, lying\nautomatically as the lesser of two evils.\n\nHis aunt Katisha, her inquisitorial duty discharged, dropped the\ndiscolored handkerchief pointedly on Oliver's desk and rejoined Glenna\nand Orella Simms. The car drove away. Oliver, left alone in the\ngrowing dusk of evening to his miserable introspection, found his\nwandering attention returning unaccountably to the crumpled\nhandkerchief, and drew it closer for a better look.\n\nIt was only a harmless square of linen, smudged with dust and spotted\nwith blood from Bivins' chow-bitten leg--but with his closer look\nOliver's world sprang up and exploded with a shattering bang in his\nstartled face.\n\nThe dust was quite ordinary, but Bivins' blood was not.\n\nIt was green.\n\nHe was never quite sure, later, just what happened next. He retained a\nvague memory of roaring away in his Aunt Katisha's car through a\nreckless showering of crushed shell; sometimes he could recall the\ncool onrush of wind whipping his face and the frantic dodging of\napproaching headlamps on the highway. But in the main, his descent\nupon the Furnay estate was a blank.\n\nOnly one fact stood out with freezing clarity, excluding any thought\nof his Aunt Katisha's certain wrath or of Orella's maidenly\nreproaches: Perrl-high-C-trill-and-A-above was in Deadly Danger, and\nthere was none but Oliver Watts to rescue her.\n\nThere was a brief instant of lucidity as he approached the Furnay\ngates through the cabbage palms and was forced to choose a course of\naction.\n\nThe attendant certainly would not admit him without orders from Mr.\nFurnay, who as certainly would not give them; the walls were much too\nhigh and sheer for climbing; and to make the need for haste even more\ncritical, it was only too obvious that the Furnay gang was about to\ndepart.\n\nA tremendous saucer-shaped ship had landed by the menagerie building,\nwhere it sat with circular peripheral ports aglow and lines of bold\nenigmatic hieroglyphs fluorescing greenly on its smooth undersurface.\nJointed metal figures scurried here and there, chivvying the last of\nMr. Furnay's herbivores up a ramp into the belly of the ship; the\npredators, in cages drawn by other sleek robot stevedores, followed in\norderly procession.\n\nOliver solved his problem of entry by driving headlong through the\niron grillwork.\n\nThere was a raucous yelling from the gateman, a monstrous rending of\nmetal and jangling of broken glass. Aunt Katisha's car slewed\nerratically down the Furnay drive, turned over twice and pitched\nOliver out, stunned for the second time that day, into the greenish\nglow shed by the saucer-ship's lights.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe struggled back to awareness to find his head pillowed on something\nsoft and wonderfully comfortable. A circle of startled faces, most of\nthem dark facsimiles of the putteed Bivins', stared uncertainly down\nat him. In the near foreground stood Mr. Furnay, wringing his hands\nand muttering grittily to himself in his own dissonant tongue. Mr.\nFurnay, seen now for the first time without his too-large Panama,\nexhibited instead of hair a crest of downy blue feathers and pronged\nantennae that vibrated softly in the evening breeze.\n\n\"Where is she?\" Oliver demanded. He scrambled dizzily to his feet, and\nthe circle of faces melted backward hastily. \"What have you done with\nPearl, you monsters?\"\n\nPerrl-high-C-trill-and-A-above, on whose lap Oliver's head had been\npillowed, stood up to move between Oliver and the patently\napprehensive Mr. Furnay. She wore a light maroon cape over her sunsuit\nagainst the mild chill of evening, and could not possibly have looked\nless like a damsel in distress. She seemed, as a matter of fact, quite\nhappy.\n\n\"I hoped you would come to see me again before blastoff,\" she said.\nHer voice skipped, tinkling with pleasure, from octave to octave. \"But\nso suddenly--so dashing, so impetuous!\"\n\n\"You're going away _willingly_?\" Oliver said dumbly. \"Then they're not\nforcing--you're not a prisoner after all?\"\n\nHer laugh was an arpeggiando blending of surprise and amusement. \"A\nprisoner of these _Tsammai_? No. I am a performer in their company,\nhired by Xtll--Mr. Furnay--to train and exhibit animals native to my\nown world.\"\n\n\"But I heard Furnay threaten you in the menagerie building this\nafternoon! His tone--\"\n\n\"The _Tsammai_ tongue sounds dreadful because it is all consonants and\nnot based on pitch and nuance as mine is,\" she said. \"But the\n_Tsammai_ themselves are only tradesmen, and are very gentle.\nXtll--Mr. Furnay--only feared that I might say too much to you then,\nwhen it was important that the natives should not suspect our\nidentity.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" Mr. Furnay nodded, sounding relieved. \"We must avoid\nnotice on such worlds as yours, which are too backward to appreciate\nthe marvels of our show. We stop here only to scout for new and novel\nexhibits.\"\n\n\"Show!\" Oliver echoed, \"You mean all this is--is--\"\n\n\"What else?\" asked Mr. Furnay. He pointed with his antennae to the\nfluorescent hieroglyphs on the undersurface of the saucer-ship. \"See,\nin our _lingua galactica_ it reads: SKRRFF BROTHERS' INTERSTELLAR\nCIRCUS, THE GALAXY'S GREATEST. It is the best on the circuit.\"\n\nHe indicated the circle of identical Bivinses. \"These are the Skrrff\nbrothers, our owners. I, sir, am business manager.\"\n\n\"But not always a good one,\" one of the brothers said pointedly. \"This\ntime he has bought an entire menagerie of such fierceness that our\ntrainers cannot exhibit it. It will have to be sold to some\nfrontier-planet zoo, and our loss will be staggering.\"\n\nIt was left for Perrl-high-C-trill-and-A-above to deal with the\nproblem, which she did with universal feminine practicality.\n\n\"Oliver made your bear well,\" she pointed out. \"And he is afraid of\nnothing--nothing! Could he not train his own fierce beasts as well as\nI train my gentle ones?\"\n\nOliver said, \"Huh?\"\n\nThe Skrrff brothers, of course, implored Oliver on the spot to join\nthem at any salary.\n\nPerrl-high-C-trill-and-A-above said demurely, in three octaves and for\nall the world to hear: \"And I'm _lonely_, Oliver!\"\n\nOliver never had a chance.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLife in Landsdale goes quietly on, the ripples made by Oliver's\ndeparture long since smoothed away by the years.\n\nMiss Orella Simms has married the Methodist minister who was to have\nmarried her to Oliver. Aunt Katisha and Glenna have resigned\nthemselves to Oliver's escape and have taken over the job of assisting\nOrella to superintend her husband's career, an occupation eminently\nsatisfactory to all because the placid cleric never dreams troublesome\ndreams of adventure, as Oliver did, to try their matriarchal patience.\n\n... But life is never dull for Mr. and Mrs. Oliver Watts, whose\nbreathtaking performances currently electrify the thrill-hungry\ncultures of a thousand worlds. They have traveled from Sirius to\nSagittarius, and at this writing have two children: a golden-haired\ndaughter of four named Perrl-high-C-trill-and-A-sharp-above, and a\ntow-headed boy of two who has a cowlick like his father's and whose\nname is Butch.\n\nThey are very happy and there has been no talk between them, though\nthey are wealthy enough in galactic credits by now to have bought half\na planet for a home, of settling down to the quiet life. They are\nquite satisfied to leave such consequential decisions to those who\nlike change for the sake of change or who, unlike Oliver, never know\nwhen they are well off.\n\nOne clean break to a lifetime, Oliver maintains, is enough.\n\n                                                           --ROGER DEE\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Clean Break, by Roger Dee\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CLEAN BREAK ***\n\n***** This file should be named 32212-8.txt or 32212-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/2/2/1/32212/\n\nProduced by Sankar Viswanathan, Greg Weeks, and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
