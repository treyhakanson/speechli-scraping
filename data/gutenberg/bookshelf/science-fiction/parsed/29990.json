He ran his tongue around his mouth and grimaced.\n\n\"Wonder how long I slept ... feels like too long,\" he muttered. \"Well,\nthey would have called me.\"\n\nThe \"cabin\" was a ninety-degree wedge of a cylinder hardly eight feet\nhigh. From one end of its outer arc across to the other was just over\nten feet, so that it had been necessary to bevel two corners of the\nhinged, three-by-seven bunk to clear the sides of the wedge. Lockers\nflattened the arc behind the bunk.\n\nTremont maneuvered himself into a vertical position in the eighteen\ninches between the bunk and a flat surface that cut off the point of\nthe wedge. He stretched out an arm to remove towel and razor from one\nof the lockers, then carefully folded the bunk upward and hooked it\nsecurely in place.\n\nWith room to turn now, he swung around and slid open a double door in\nthe flat surface, revealing a shaft three feet square whose center was\nalso the theoretical intersection of his cabin walls. Tremont pulled\nhimself into the shaft. From \"up\" forward, light leaked through a\npartly open hatch, and he could hear a murmur of voices as he\njackknifed in the opposite direction.\n\n\"At least two of them are up there,\" he grunted.\n\nHe wondered which of the other three cabins was occupied, meanwhile\npulling himself along by the ladder rungs welded to one corner of the\nshaft. He reached a slightly wider section aft, which boasted\nentrances to two air locks, a spacesuit locker, a galley, and a head.\nHe entered the last, noting the murmur of air-conditioning machinery\non the other side of the bulkhead.\n\nTremont hooked a foot under a toehold to maintain his position facing\na mirror. He plugged in his razor, turned on the exhauster in the slot\nbelow the mirror to keep the clippings out of his eyes, and began to\nshave. As the beard disappeared, he considered the deals he had come\nto Centauri to put through.\n\n\"A funny business!\" he told his image. \"Dealing in ideas! Can you\nreally sell a man's thoughts?\"\n\nBeginning to work around his chin, he decided that it actually was\npractical. Ideas, in fact, were almost the only kind of import worth\nbringing from Sol to Alpha Centauri. Large-scale shipments of\nnecessities were handled by the Federated Governments. To carry even\nprecious or power metals to Earth or to return with any type of\nmanufactured luxury was simply too expensive in money, fuel, effort,\nand time.\n\nOn the other hand, traveling back every five years to buy up plans and\nlicenses for the latest inventions or processes--_that_ was profitable\nenough to provide a good living for many a man in Tremont's business.\nAll he needed were a number of reliable contacts and a good knowledge\nof the needs of the three planets and four satellites colonized in\nthe Centaurian system.\n\nOnly three days earlier, Tremont had returned from his most recent\ntrip to the old star, landing from the great interstellar ship on the\nouter moon of Centauri VII. There he leased this small rocket--the\n_Annabel_, registered more officially as the AC7-4-525--for his local\ntraveling. It would be another five days before he reached the\ninhabited moons of Centauri VI.\n\nHe stopped next in the galley for a quick breakfast out of tubes,\nregretting the greater convenience of the starship, then returned the\ntowel and razor to his cabin. He decided that his slightly rumpled\nshirt and slacks of utilitarian gray would do for another day. About\nthirty-eight, an inch or two less than six feet and muscularly slim,\nTremont had an air of habitual neatness. His dark hair, thinning at\nthe temples, was clipped short and brushed straight back. There were\nsmile wrinkles at the corners of his blue eyes and grooving his lean\ncheeks.\n\nHe closed the cabin doors and pulled himself forward to enter the\ncontrol room through the partly open hatch. The forward bulkhead\noffered no more head room than did his own cabin, but there seemed to\nbe more breathing space because this chamber was not quartered. Deck\nspace, however, was at such a premium because of the controls,\nacceleration couches, and astrogating equipment that the hatch was the\nlargest clear area.\n\nTwo men and a girl turned startled eyes upon Tremont as he rose into\ntheir view. One of the men, about forty-five but sporting a youngish\nmanner to match his blond crewcut and tanned features, glanced quickly\nat his wrist watch.\n\n\"Am I too early?\" demanded Tremont with sudden coldness. \"What are you\ndoing with my case there?\"\n\nThe girl, in her early twenties and carefully pretty with her long\nblack hair neatly netted for space, snatched back a small hand from\nthe steel strongbox that was shaped to fit into an attach\u00e9 case. The\nsecond man, under thirty but thick-waisted in a gray tee-shirt, said\nin the next breath, \"Take him!\"\n\nToo late, Tremont saw that the speaker had already braced a foot\nagainst the far bulkhead. Then the broad face with its crooked blob of\na nose above a ridiculous little mustache shot across the chamber at\nhim. Desperately, Tremont groped for a hold that would help him either\nto avoid the charge or to pull himself back into the shaft, but he was\ncaught half in and half out.\n\nHe met the rush with a fist, but the tangle of bodies immediately\nbecame confusing beyond belief as the other pair joined in.\n\nSomething cracked across the back of his head, much too hard to have\nbeen accidental.\n\nWhen Tremont began to function again, it took him only a few seconds\nto realize that life had been going on without him for some little\ntime.\n\nFor one thing, the heavy man's nosebleed had stopped, and he was\ntenderly combing blood from his mustache with a fingertip.\n\nFor another, they had managed to stuff Tremont into a spacesuit and\nhaul him down the shaft to the air lock. Someone had noosed the thumbs\nof the gauntlets together and tied the cord to the harness supporting\nthe air tanks.\n\nTremont twisted his head around to eye the three of them without\nspeaking. He was trying to decide where he had made his mistake.\n\nBill Braigh, the elderly youth with the crewcut? Ralph Peters, the\npilot who had come with the ship? Dorothy Stauber, the trim brunette\nwho had made the trip from Earth on the same starship as Tremont? He\ncould not make up his mind without more to go on.\n\nThen he remembered with a sinking sensation that _all_ of them had\nbeen clustered about his case of papers and microfilms when he had\ninterrupted them.\n\n\"I trust you aren't thinking of making us any trouble, Tremont,\"\ndrawled Braigh. \"Give up the idea; you've been no trouble at all.\"\n\n\"Where do you think this is getting you?\" demanded Tremont.\n\nBraigh chuckled.\n\n\"Wherever it would have gotten you,\" he said. \"Only at less expense.\"\n\n\"Ask him for the combination,\" growled Peters.\n\nBraigh scrutinized Tremont's expression.\n\n\"It would probably take us a while, Ralph,\" he decided regretfully.\n\"It's simpler to put him outside now and be free to use tools on the\nbox.\"\n\nTremont opened his mouth to protest, but Braigh clapped the helmet\nover his head and screwed it fast.\n\n\"You'll never read the code!\" yelled Tremont, struggling to break\nfree. \"Those papers are no good to you without me!\"\n\nSomeone slammed him against the bulkhead and held him there with his\nface to it. He could do nothing with his hands, joined as they were,\nand very little with his feet. It dawned upon him that they could not\nhear a word, and he fell silent. Twisting his head to peer out the\nside curve of his vision band, he caught a glimpse of Peters suiting\nup.\n\nA few minutes later, they opened the inner hatch of the air lock and\nshoved Tremont inside. Peters followed, gripping him firmly about the\nknees from behind.\n\n\"Here we go!\" grunted Peters, and Tremont realized that he could\ncommunicate again, over their suit radios.\n\n\"You won't get far, trying to read the code I have those papers\nwritten in,\" he warned. \"You'd better talk this over before you make a\nmistake.\"\n\n\"Ain't no mistake about it,\" said Peters, pressing toward the outer\nhatch. \"So you chartered the rocket. You felt you oughta go out to see\nabout a heavy dust particle hitting the hull. You fell off an' we\nnever found you.\"\n\n\"How will you explain not going yourself? Or not finding me by\ninstruments?\"\n\nPeters clubbed Tremont's foot from the tank rack he had hooked with\nthe toe.\n\n\"How could I go? Leave the ship without a pilot? An' the screens are\nfor pickin' up meteorites far enough out to mean somethin' at the\nspeeds they travel. So you were too close to register, leastways till\nit was way too late. You must have suffocated when your air ran out.\"\n\nTremont scrabbled about with his feet for some kind of hold. The outer\nhatch began to open. He could see stars out there.\n\n\"Wait!\" shouted Tremont.\n\nIt was too late. He felt himself shoot forward as if Peters had thrust\na foot into the small of his back and shoved. Tremont tried to grab at\nthe edge of the air lock, but it was gone. A puff of air frosted about\nhim, its human bullet.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe stars spun slowly before his eyes. After a moment, the gleaming\nhull of the _Annabel_ swam into his field of view. It was already\nthirty feet away and the air lock was closing. He caught a glimpse of\na spacesuited figure with the light behind it.\n\nThen he was looking at the stars again.\n\nThe small, distant brilliance of Alpha Centauri made him squint in the\nsplit second before the suit's photoelectric cells caused filters to\nflip down before his eyes. Then it was stars again, and the filters\nretracted.\n\n\"They can't do this!\" said Tremont. \"_Peters!_ Do you hear me? You\ncan't get away with this!\"\n\nThere was no answer.\n\nThe rocket came into view again, farther away. He had to get back\nsomehow. Forgetting the bound position of his hands, he attempted to\ncheck his belt equipment. Holding his arms as far as possible from his\nbody was not enough to let him get a look at the harness from within\nhis helmet.\n\nHe tugged violently at the cord holding the thumbs of his gauntlets,\nand thought it gave slightly.\n\n_Maybe it just tightened_, he thought.\n\nTo free his hands, he drew his arms in through the wide armpits of the\nsuit sleeves, built that way to enable the wearer to feed himself,\nwipe his brow, or adjust clothing or heating units within the suit. He\nfelt more comfortable but that got him nowhere except for the chance\nto consult his wrist watch.\n\nSet at the lunar time of Centauri VII-4, it told him that when he had\ngone out of the airlock five minutes before the time had been 17:36.\nIt did not strike Tremont as being a very promising bit of\ndata--warning him merely that when he began to feel the want of air,\nit would be about 21:30. He longed for a pen-knife.\n\n\"_There's_ one thing I'm going to ask about on my next trip to Sol--if\nI make one!\" he muttered. \"Has anyone developed a reliable, small\n_suit_ air lock, so you can pass things out from your pockets?\"\n\nHe thrust his hands once more into the arms of the suit, and felt as\nfar along his belt as he could. He did manage to reach the usual\nposition of the standard rocket pistol. The hook was empty.\n\n\"Well, that's that!\" he groaned. \"They didn't forget. I have nothing\nto maneuver with.\"\n\nHe pondered worriedly. Perhaps the air--if he dared to waste any, it\nwould make a small jet. Slow, but he had all the rest of his life!\n\nHe settled down to picking at the cord about his thumbs with the tips\nof the other fingers in his gauntlets. It seemed possible that he\nmight in time chew it up to the point where it could be snapped.\n\nThe stars streamed slowly past his line of vision as he spun through\nthe emptiness. Two or three little bits of the cord chipped off and\ndrifted away. Tremont realized that it was frozen and brittle. He\nredoubled his efforts. After a few minutes of clumsy clicking of\nfingertips against thumbs, he strained to pull his hands apart.\n\nThe cord parted and his arms jerked out to their full spread with such\nsuddenness that he felt his backbone creak. For a moment, he hung\nmotionless inside his suit, wondering if he had hurt himself.\n\nRecovering, he groped about, checking for his equipment. He discovered\nthat nothing had been left. No knife, no rocket pistol, no line with\nmagnet for securing oneself to a hull.\n\n_Well, at least I can reach the valves of the air tanks_, he reassured\nhimself.\n\nHe watched for the ship, so as to judge his direction. Several minutes\npassed before he allowed himself to recognize the truth of his\nsituation: he could no longer see the gleam of Alpha Centauri on the\nhull!\n\nHe was already too far out to dare to waste air. He might give away\nhis last four hours of life just to send himself in the wrong\ndirection.\n\n\"How did I get myself into this?\" he groaned.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe set himself to thinking back to his meetings with the others.\nDorothy Stauber had landed from the same starship after passage from\nSol, but he had not become acquainted with her during the trip except\nto pass the time of day. He seemed to remember that she had turned up\nin the Customs dome to ask his advice on travel....\n\n\"Ye-ah!\" he growled to himself. \"_After_ I phoned to lease a rocket.\nShe must have known, but how?\"\n\nSomeone in the shipping office? Well, why not Peters, the pilot? And\nthen Braigh had come along, pretending to have been on his way back to\nCentauri VI and hoping to buy a fast passage on a small vessel for\nbusiness reasons. He had been free and ready with his money, leading\nTremont to consider cutting his own expenses on the charter.\n\nIt seemed, on the face of it, that the three of them had never met\nuntil the _Annabel_ lifted.\n\n\"But they had, all right!\" Tremont told himself. \"That was no chance,\nanywhere along the line. I've been very neatly highjacked!\"\n\nThe girl must have trailed him to make sure they picked up the right\nman. Braigh had never explained exactly what he was doing on the\nsatellite; he could have arranged for the assignment of the rocket, or\nperhaps of the pilot, when Tremont called. Then they had gathered\naround to hitch rides, and had been in control ever since.\n\nTremont looked at the slowly progressing constellations and cursed\nhimself. He began to have the feeling that there would be no way out\nof this. They would regret pitching him into space in such an offhand\nmanner, he reminded himself, when they opened his case. It would be\ntoo late as far as he was concerned.\n\n_Come to think of it_, he considered, _that Braigh looks pretty smart,\nunder that idiot-kid pose. He might just break my code, given time.\nAnd the parts made up of model photos or drawings he can sell almost\nas is._\n\nWhen he came to think of it, Tremont was surprised that no one had\ntried the same racket before. He had laid out a fortune for what the\nthree thieves were stealing from him.\n\nHe drew in his left arm again and raised the wrist to the neck of his\nhelmet. By looking down his nose, he discovered to his surprise that\nhe had been out nearly an hour. He had wasted more time than he\nthought in reviewing his earlier encounters with Dorothy aboard the\nstarship and the others at the spaceport.\n\nHe raised the water tube to his mouth and sucked in a mouthful. The\ntaste was stale.\n\n_I could do with a beer, if this is the way I'm going out_, he\nthought. _They can joke all they want about dying in bed after\ntraveling to the stars; but you could order a beer even if it killed\nyou._\n\nIt gradually dawned upon him that the hazy light he had accepted as\nbeing a nebula must be something closer. He watched for it, and\ndiscovered after a few moments that it was growing brighter. It\ncontinued to do so for half an hour.\n\n\"It might be another ship!\" he breathed, then he began to shout,\n\"Mayday! Mayday!\" over his radio.\n\nHe kept it up for nearly a quarter of an hour, even after the outline\nwas definitely recognizable as a rocket. He found himself drifting\nacross its course near the bow. It was hard to estimate the distance,\nbut he guessed it to be something like a hundred yards.\n\n_Drifting?_ he asked himself. _It should be going past me like a\nshooting star! Unless they took exactly the same curve from Centauri\nVII--_\n\nThen he could read the numbers he feared to see. AC7-4-525. His own\nship.\n\nHe had gone out of the air lock mainly on a puff of air, with some\nfumbling help from Peters. That had been enough to send him out of\nsight of the ship--in space, not necessarily very far--and now he was\nback, after two hours.\n\n_A long, flat orbit in relation to the ship_, he told himself,\nremembering in time to avoid speaking aloud that Braigh might be at\nthe ship's radio, _but actually weaving back and forth across the\nrocket's course, just nipping it at this end_.\n\nHe edged a hand inside the suit again and turned off his radio. If he\nfound an answer, it would be fatal to be overheard mumbling about it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe ship now seemed to be rushing at him, and Tremont deduced that his\norbital speed had increased as he approached the focus represented by\nthe _Annabel_. He would doubtless pass near the air lock at about his\nexpulsion speed.\n\n\"Here's the chance!\" he exulted. \"A little air let out to slow down ... or\neven just to veer close enough to lay hands on something! You launched me,\nPeters, but you didn't lose me.\"\n\nGetting through the airlock should be easy enough. He might be well up\nthe shaft before the others emerged from the control room. In fact,\nunless Peters were on watch, the air lock operating signal might flash\nunnoticed on the board.\n\n\"And I'll be cracking skulls before they know what's up!\" he growled.\n\nIt struck him with a flash of ironic amusement that he had not felt\nhalf so much hate when believing himself doomed. After two hours of\nsweating out his helplessness, he had discovered a lively resentment\nof the vicious callousness with which he had been jettisoned.\n\nHe was only about twenty-five yards away now, seemingly circling the\nship. Peering closer, he saw that actually he was sweeping in toward\nit.\n\n_Now, be ready with the air tank valve, just in case!_ he warned\nhimself.\n\nThe great fins loomed to his right; the hull blotted most of the sky\nfrom his view. It looked as if he would curve down to a spot beside\nthe same air lock from which he had been expelled. It seemed to be\nstill open.\n\nThen he saw the shape of a helmet rise around the curve of the ship.\nSomeone was out on the hull.\n\nTremont switched on his radio and listened.\n\nThe spacesuited figure climbed completely into view. There appeared to\nbe a line running from the belt into the air lock, and the figure\ncarried a long pole of some sort.\n\n\"Oh, there you are, Tremont!\" came Braigh's voice over the receiver.\n\"I've been waiting for you.\"\n\nThe chuckle that followed made Tremont curse, which in turn provoked a\nhearty laugh from the other.\n\n\"You didn't think I'd forget you?\" asked Braigh. \"We figured out what\nhappened as soon as we heard you putting out those distress calls.\nAfter that, it was just a matter of timing. Have you had an amusing\ntrip?\"\n\n\"Have you found out you can't make anything of those papers yet?\"\ncountered Tremont.\n\n\"Oh, the coding? It might take a little time, but we have plenty ...\nnow, now, Tremont! That kind of abusive language will get you\nnowhere.\"\n\nTremont had drifted to a point above the other's head, almost within\nreach. He was kicking out in little motions that betrayed his\neagerness to come to grips with Braigh or _something_ solid.\n\n\"Why, Tremont! I do believe that you thought I came out to bargain\nwith you,\" chuckled the blond man. \"Not at all! I told you that you'd\nbe no trouble. I just came out to finish the job Peters bungled.\"\n\nTremont saw the pole jabbing upward at his stomach. Instinctively, he\ngrabbed at the end. Braigh was not disturbed.\n\n\"Take it with you, then!\" he laughed, letting go his end with a\npowerful push. \"Let me know if you're alive the next time you come\naround, so I can come out again.\"\n\nTremont began to swear at him, then got a grip on himself long enough\nto snap his radio off.\n\nHe had begun pulling himself down the pole when Braigh had shoved.\nThat sapped some of the force, but it was still enough to send him\nspinning out into the void once more.\n\nThe ship receded slowly. He saw Braigh return to the air lock and\nenter. A moment later, that light was cut off, and Tremont began to\nback off into space as he had the first time.\n\n_They know all about it_, he realized. _They could leave me any time\njust by burning a little fuel. Peters wouldn't care about wasting\nit--I paid for it. Maybe he's just too lazy to calculate the course\ncorrection._\n\nIf so, he decided, the pilot was right. Tremont might drift back, but\ntwo more hours from now, when he would be at his closest, would be too\nlate. He would be too near the end of his air to use it to make sure\nof the last few feet.\n\nHe looked at the pole in his grip. It was an eight-foot section of\naluminum from the cargo racks.\n\n\"Maybe ...\" he muttered.\n\nWhirling the pole around by the end, he managed after considerable\ntrial and error, to slow his wild spin enough to keep the ship in\nview.\n\nThe only question then was whether he dared to take the chance; and he\nreally had but one choice. The full orbit would be too long a period.\n\nHe estimated as well as he could the direction of his progress,\nallowed a few degrees which he fondly hoped would curve him in to a\ncloser approach at the meeting point, and hurled the pole into space\nwith all his strength.\n\nAfter that, there was nothing to do but wait and hope that he had cut\nhis speed enough to bring him to the ship ahead of schedule by a\nshorter orbit.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTremont finally gave up looking at his watch when he found himself\npeeping every three minutes, on the average. The immensity of space\nwas by now instilling in him a psychological chill, and he drew both\narms in from their sleeves to hug an illusion of warmth to him. The\nair pressure in the sleeves gradually overpowered the springs of the\njoints, and extended them to make a cross.\n\nAs far as he could tell from the gauges lined in a miniature row\nalong the neckpiece of the suit, his heating system was functioning as\ndesigned. The batteries had an excellent chance of lasting longer than\nhe would.\n\nHe began to dwell upon thoughts of squeezing Peters in the steel grip\nof his gauntlets until the pilot's fat face turned purple and his eyes\npopped. Another promising activity would be to bang Braigh's head\nagainst a bulkhead with one hand and Dorothy's with the other.\n\n_Wonder if they found the gun in my locker?_ he mused.\n\nFinally, only a lifetime or two after he hoped to see it, he sighted\nthe ship again. His watch claimed the trip had lasted less than ninety\nminutes.\n\nHe encountered unexpected trouble approaching the hull. Realizing that\nhe was lucky to come close at all by such a guess, he tried to steer\nhimself with brief jets from his air tank, and wound up on the verge\nof bashing directly into a fin. He avoided that, but had to use more\nair to spin back for a more gentle contact.\n\nThe metal felt like solid Earth to him as he seized the edge of a fin\nand planted the magnets of his boots firmly on the hull.\n\nIt was perhaps twenty minutes later, when Tremont was beginning to\nworry again about his air supply, that the hatch of the air lock began\nto open.\n\nCrystals of frost puffed out as the water vapor left the air. Braigh's\nhelmet appeared, then the whole spacesuited figure floated up before\nthe spot where Tremont was watching. The highjacker dropped the\nmagnet of his life line against the hull and started to turn around.\n\nTremont grabbed the edge of the hatch with one hand, yanked the magnet\nloose with the other, and kicked Braigh in the right area.\n\nThe spacesuited figure shot off, tumbling end over end, into the void.\nA startled squawk sounded over Tremont's receiver.\n\n\"See how _you_ like it!\" he snarled.\n\nHe ignored the begging of the suddenly frightened voice, and dived\ninto the air lock. In seconds, he had the outer hatch shut and was\nnervously watching the air pressure building up on the gauge.\n\n_If they notice at all, they'll think it's Braigh coming back!_ he\nexulted.\n\nHe made it into the central shaft without meeting anyone. Pulling\nhimself forward in the bulky suit was an awkward task, but well worth\nit for the expression on Peters' face when Tremont burst through the\ncontrol-room hatch.\n\nAfter dealing with the pilot in about two minutes, most of it spent in\ncatching him, Tremont went back along the shaft and found Dorothy in\nher bunk. Before she could release the netting, he folded the bunk\nupon her and secured it to the hook. Only then did he allow himself\nthe time to remove his helmet and make free of the ship's air.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" demanded the girl, rather shrilly.\n\nTremont realized that she must have seen the unconscious Peters\nfloating outside in the shaft.\n\n\"You won't like it!\" he promised.\n\n\"Tremont! I didn't know they'd do anything to you. Can't ... you and I ...\nmake some kind of ... deal?\"\n\nTremont stared at her levelly.\n\n\"But I'd have to really sleep sometime,\" he pointed out gently. \"How\ncan I trust you...?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was hardly a million miles out from the satellite system of\nCentauri VI when the Space Patrol ship he had called managed to put a\npilot aboard to land the _Annabel_ for him on the largest moon.\n\nTremont returned wearily from helping the man in the air lock--which\nhe did with a practiced efficiency that surprised the pilot--to resume\nhis talk with the patrol-ship captain waiting on the screen.\n\n\"We could have done it sooner, you know,\" said the latter curiously.\n\"Well, now that I see him beside you, perhaps you'll explain your\nrequest to delay, and also what those pips trailing you are.\"\n\n\"It's all the same story,\" said Tremont, and explained his\ndifficulties.\n\nThe patrol captain frowned and expressed a wish to lay hands on the\nhighjackers.\n\n\"Well, they're due back in\"--Tremont consulted his watch--\"about two\nhours. I wanted them near the ends of their orbits as you approached.\"\n\n\"You mean there are three bodies out there?\"\n\n\"Live ones, in spacesuits,\" said Tremont. \"Experience is a great\nteacher. As soon as I sighted Braigh coming back, I set up a regular\nsystem.\"\n\nHe explained how he had removed all tools from the three spacesuits,\nadded extra tanks, and stuffed the trio into them, either unconscious\nor at gunpoint.\n\n\"Then, having fastened the ankles together and wired the wrists to the\nthighs so they couldn't move at all, I launched them one at a time\nwith enough pressure in the air lock to give four-hour orbits. That\ngave me sleeping time.\"\n\n\"And what about them?\" asked the captain.\n\n\"Oh, at the end of that period, they'd come drifting in at one-hour\nintervals. Counting all the necessary operations, each of them got\nthirty minutes actually out of the suit to eat and so on. Then out\nhe'd go while I fished in the next one.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
