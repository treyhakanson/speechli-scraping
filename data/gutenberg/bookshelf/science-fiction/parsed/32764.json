FYFE\n\n\n                       Illustrated by MARCHETTI\n\n\n     With everyone gone elsewhere, Earth was perfect for gracious\n     living--only there was nothing gracious about it!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nThe red tennis robot scooted desperately across the court, its four\nwide-set wheels squealing. For a moment, Robert's hard-hit passing\nshot seemed to have scored. Then, at the last instant, the robot\nwhipped around its single racket-equipped arm. Robert sprawled\nheadlong in a futile lunge at the return.\n\n\"Game and set to Red Three,\" announced the referee box from its high\nstation above the net.\n\n\"Ah, shut up!\" growled Robert, and flung down his racket for one of\nthe white serving robots to retrieve.\n\n\"Yes, Robert,\" agreed the voice. \"Will Robert continue to play?\"\nInterpreting the man's savage mumble as a negative, it told his\nopponent, \"Return to your stall, Red Three!\"\n\nRobert strode off wordlessly toward the house. Reaching the\nhundred-foot-square swimming pool, he hesitated uncertainly.\n\n\"Weather's so damned hot,\" he muttered. \"Why didn't the old-time\nscientists find out how to do something about that while there were\nstill enough people on Earth to manage it?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHe stripped off his damp clothing and dropped it on the \"beach\" of\nwhite sand. Behind him sounded the steps of a humanoid serving robot,\nhastening to pick it up. Robert plunged deep into the cooling water\nand let himself float lazily to the surface.\n\n_Maybe they did, he thought. I could send a robot over to the old city\nlibrary for information. Still, actually doing anything would probably\ntake the resources of a good many persons--and it isn't so easy to\nfind people now that Earth is practically deserted._\n\nHe rolled sideward for a breath and began to swim slowly for the\nopposite side of the pool, reflecting upon the curious culture of the\nplanet. Although he had accepted this all his life, it really was\nremarkable how the original home of the human race had been forsaken\nfor fresher worlds among the stars. Or was it more remarkable that a\nfew individuals had asserted their independence by remaining?\n\nRobert was aware that the decision involved few difficulties,\nconsidering the wealth of robots and other automatic machines. He\nregretted knowing so few humans, though they were really not\nnecessary. If not for his hobby of televising, he would probably not\nknow any at all.\n\n\"Wonder how far past the old city I'd have to go to meet someone in\nperson,\" he murmured as he pulled himself from the pool. \"Maybe I\nought to try accepting that televised invitation of the other night.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSeveral dark usuform robots were smoothing the sand on this beach\nunder the direction of a blue humanoid supervisor. Watching them idly,\nRobert estimated that it must be ten years since he had seen another\nhuman face to face. His parents were dim memories. He got along very\nwell, however, with robots to serve him or to obtain occasional\ninformation from the automatic scanners of the city library that had\nlong ago been equipped to serve such a purpose.\n\n\"Much better than things were in the old days,\" he told himself as he\ncrossed the lawn to his sprawling white mansion. \"Must have been awful\nbefore the population declined. Imagine having people all around you,\nhaving to listen to them, see them, and argue to make them do what you\nwanted!\"\n\nThe heel of his bare right foot came down heavily on a pebble, and he\nswore without awareness of the precise meaning of the ancient phrases.\nHe limped into the baths and beckoned a waiting robot as he stretched\nout on a rubbing table.\n\n\"Call Blue One!\" he ordered.\n\nThe red robot pushed a button on the wall before beginning the\nmassage. In a few moments, the major-domo arrived.\n\n\"Did Robert enjoy the tennis?\" it inquired politely.\n\n\"I did _not_!\" snapped the man. \"Red Three won--and by too big a\nscore. Have it geared down a few feet per second.\"\n\n\"Yes, Robert.\"\n\n\"And have the lawn screened again for pebbles!\"\n\nAs Blue One retired he relaxed, and turned his mind to ideas for\nfilling the evening. He hoped Henry would televise: Robert had news\nfor him.\n\nAfter a short nap and dinner, he took the elevator to his three-story\ntower and turned on the television robot. Seating himself in a\ncomfortable armchair, he directed the machine from one channel to\nanother. For some time, there was no answer to his perfunctory call\nsignals, but one of his few acquaintances finally came on.\n\n\"Jack here,\" said a quiet voice that Robert had long suspected of\nbeing disguised by a filter microphone.\n\n\"I haven't heard you for some weeks,\" he remarked, eying the swirling\ncolors on the screen.\n\nHe disliked Jack for never showing his face, but curiosity as to what\nlay behind the mechanical image projected by the other's transmitter\npreserved the acquaintance.\n\n\"I was ... busy,\" said the bodiless voice, with a discreet hint of a\nchuckle that Robert found chilling.\n\nHe wondered what Jack had been up to. He remembered once being favored\nwith a televised view of Jack's favorite sport--a battle between\ncompanies of robots designed for the purpose, horribly reminiscent of\nhuman conflicts Robert had seen on historical films.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe soon made an excuse to break off and set the robot to scanning\nHenry's channel. He had something to tell the older man, who lived\nonly about a hundred miles away and was as close to being his friend\nas was possible in this age of scattered, self-sufficient dwellings.\n\n\"I don't mind talking to _him_,\" Robert reflected. \"At least he\ndoesn't overdo this business of individual privacy.\"\n\nHe thought briefly of the disdainful face--seemingly on a distant\nstation--which had merely examined him for several minutes one night\nwithout ever condescending to speak. Recalling his rage at this\ntreatment, Robert wondered how the ancients had managed to get along\ntogether when there were so many of them. They must have had some\nstrict code of behavior, he supposed, or they never would have bred\nso enormous a population.\n\n\"I must find out about that someday,\" he decided. \"How did you act,\nfor instance, if you wanted to play tennis but someone else just\nrefused and went to eat dinner? Maybe that was why the ancients had so\nmany murders.\"\n\nHe noticed that the robot was getting an answer from Henry's station,\nand was pleased. He could talk as long as he liked, knowing Henry\nwould not resent his cutting off any time he became bored with the\nconversation.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe robot focused the image smoothly. Henry gave the impression of\nbeing a small man. He was gray and wrinkled compared with Robert, but\nhis black eyes were alertly sharp. He smiled his greeting and\nimmediately launched into a story of one of his youthful trips through\nthe mountains, from the point at which it had been interrupted the\nlast time they had talked.\n\nRobert listened impatiently.\n\n\"Maybe I have some interesting news,\" he remarked as the other\nfinished. \"I picked up a new station the other night.\"\n\n\"That reminds me of a time when I was a boy and--\"\n\nRobert fidgeted while Henry described watching his father build a\nspare television set as a hobby, with only a minimum of robot help. He\npounced upon the first pause.\n\n\"A new station!\" he repeated. \"Came in very well, too. I can't imagine\nwhy I never picked it up before.\"\n\n\"Distant, perhaps?\" asked Henry resignedly.\n\n\"No, not very far from me, as a matter of fact.\"\n\n\"You can't always tell, especially with the ocean so close. Now that\nthere are so few people, you'd think there'd be land enough for all of\nthem; but a good many spend all their lives aboard ship-robots.\"\n\n\"Not this one,\" said Robert. \"She even showed me an outside view of\nher home.\"\n\nHenry's eyebrows rose. \"She? A woman?\"\n\n\"Her name is Marcia-Joan.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" said Henry. \"Imagine that. Women, as I recall, usually\ndo have funny names.\"\n\nHe gazed thoughtfully at his well-kept hands.\n\n\"Did I ever tell you about the last woman I knew?\" he asked. \"About\ntwenty years ago. We had a son, you know, but he grew up and wanted\nhis own home and robots.\"\n\n\"Natural enough,\" Robert commented, somewhat briefly since Henry _had_\ntold him the story before.\n\n\"I often wonder what became of him,\" mused the older man. \"That's the\ntrouble with what's left of Earth culture--no families any more.\"\n\n_Now he'll tell about the time he lived in a crowd of five, thought\nRobert. He, his wife, their boy and the visiting couple with the fleet\nof robot helicopters._\n\nDeciding that Henry could reminisce just as well without a listener,\nRobert quietly ordered the robot to turn itself off.\n\n_Maybe I will make the trip_, he pondered, on the way downstairs, _if\nonly to see what it's like with another person about_.\n\nAt about noon of the second day after that, he remembered that thought\nwith regret.\n\nThe ancient roads, seldom used and never repaired, were rough and\nbumpy. Having no flying robots, Robert was compelled to transport\nhimself and a few mechanical servants in ground vehicles. He\nhad--idiotically, he now realized--started with the dawn, and was\nalready tired.\n\nConsequently, he was perhaps unduly annoyed when two tiny spy-eyes\nflew down from the hills to hover above his caravan on whirring little\npropellers. He tried to glance up pleasantly while their lenses\ntelevised pictures to their base, but he feared that his smile was\nstrained.\n\nThe spy-eyes retired after a few minutes. Robert's vehicle, at his\nvoiced order, turned onto a road leading between two forested hills.\n\n_Right there_, he thought four hours later, _was where I made my\nmistake. I should have turned back and gone home!_\n\nHe stood in the doorway of a small cottage of pale blue trimmed with\nyellow, watching his robots unload baggage. They were supervised by\nBlue Two, the spare for Blue One.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAlso watching, as silently as Robert, was a pink-and-blue striped\nrobot which had guided the caravan from the entrance gate to the\ncottage. After one confused protest in a curiously high voice, it had\nnot spoken.\n\n_Maybe we shouldn't have driven through that flower bed_, thought\nRobert. _Still, the thing ought to be versatile enough to say so. I\nwouldn't have such a gimcrack contraption!_\n\nHe looked up as another humanoid robot in similar colors approached\nalong the line of shrubs separating the main lawns from that\nsurrounding the cottage.\n\n\"Marcia-Joan has finished her nap. You may come to the house now.\"\n\nRobert's jaw hung slack as he sought for a reply. His face flushed at\nthe idea of a robot's offering _him_ permission to enter the house.\n\nNevertheless, he followed it across the wide lawn and between banks of\ngaily blossoming flowers to the main house. Robert was not sure which\ncolor scheme he disliked more, that of the robot or the unemphatic\npastel tints of the house.\n\nThe robot led the way inside and along a hall. It pulled back a\ncurtain near the other end, revealing a room with furniture for human\nuse. Robert stared at the girl who sat in an armchair, clad in a long\nrobe of soft, pink material.\n\nShe looked a few years younger than he. Her hair and eyes were also\nbrown, though darker. In contrast to Robert's, her smooth skin was\nonly lightly tanned, and she wore her hair much longer. He thought her\noval face might have been pleasant if not for the analytical\nexpression she wore.\n\n\"I am quite human,\" he said in annoyance. \"Do you have a voice?\"\n\nShe rose and walked over to him curiously. Robert saw that she was\nseveral inches shorter than he, about the height of one of his robots.\nHe condescended to bear her scrutiny.\n\n\"You look just as you do on the telescreen,\" she marveled.\n\nRobert began to wonder if the girl were feeble-minded. How else should\nhe look?\n\n\"I usually swim at this hour,\" he said to change the subject. \"Where\nis the pool?\"\n\nMarcia-Joan stared at him.\n\n\"Pool of what?\" she asked.\n\nSensing sarcasm, he scowled. \"Pool of water, of course! To swim in.\nWhat did you think I meant--a pool of oil?\"\n\n\"I am not acquainted with your habits,\" retorted the girl.\n\n\"None of that stupid wit!\" he snapped. \"Where is the pool?\"\n\n\"Don't shout!\" shouted the girl. Her voice was high and unpleasantly\nshrill compared with his. \"I don't have a pool. Who wants a swimming\npool, anyway?\"\n\nRobert felt his face flushing with rage.\n\n_So she won't tell me!_ he thought. _All right, I'll find it myself.\nEverybody has a pool. And if she comes in, I'll hold her head under\nfor a while!_\n\nSneering, he turned toward the nearest exit from the house. The gaily\nstriped robot hastened after him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe door failed to swing back as it should have at Robert's approach.\nImpatiently, he seized the ornamental handle. He felt his shoulder\ngrasped by a metal hand.\n\n\"Do not use the front door!\" said the robot.\n\n\"Let go!\" ordered Robert, incensed that any robot should presume to\nhinder him.\n\n\"Only Marcia-Joan uses this door,\" said the robot, ignoring Robert's\ndispleasure.\n\n\"I'll use it if I like!\" declared Robert, jerking the handle.\n\nThe next moment, he was lifted bodily into the air. By the time he\nrealized what was happening, he was carried, face down, along the\nhall. Too astonished even to yell, he caught a glimpse of\nMarcia-Joan's tiny feet beneath the hem of her pink robe as his head\npassed the curtained doorway.\n\nThe robot clumped on to the door at the rear of the house and out into\nthe sunshine. There, it released its grip.\n\nWhen Robert regained the breath knocked out of him by the drop, and\nassured himself that no bones were broken, his anger returned.\n\n\"I'll find it, wherever it is!\" he growled, and set out to search the\ngrounds.\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, he was forced to admit that there really\nwas no swimming pool. Except for a brook fifty yards away, there was\nonly the tiled bathroom of the cottage to bathe in.\n\n\"Primitive!\" exclaimed Robert, eying this. \"Manually operated water\nsupply, too! I must have the robots fix something better for\ntomorrow.\"\n\nSince none of his robots was equipped with a thermometer, he had to\ndraw the bath himself. Meanwhile, he gave orders to Blue Two regarding\nthe brook and a place to swim. He managed to fill the tub without\nscalding himself mainly because there was no hot water. His\nirritation, by the time he had dressed in fresh clothes and prepared\nfor another talk with his hostess, was still lively.\n\n\"Ah, you return?\" Marcia-Joan commented from a window above the back\ndoor.\n\n\"It is time to eat,\" said Robert frankly.\n\n\"You are mistaken.\"\n\nHe glanced at the sunset, which was already fading.\n\n\"It _is_ time,\" he insisted. \"I always eat at this hour.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't.\"\n\nRobert leaned back to examine her expression more carefully. He felt\nvery much the way he had the day the water-supply robot for his pool\nhad broken down and, despite Robert's bellowed orders, had flooded a\ngood part of the lawn before Blue One had disconnected it. Some\ninstinct warned him, moreover, that bellowing now would be as useless\nas it had been then.\n\n\"What _do_ you do now?\" he asked.\n\n\"I dress for the evening.\"\n\n\"And when do you eat?\"\n\n\"After I finish dressing.\"\n\n\"I'll wait for you,\" said Robert, feeling that that much tolerance\ncould do no particular harm.\n\nHe encountered the pink-and-blue robot in the hall, superintending\nseveral plain yellow ones bearing dishes and covered platters. Robert\nfollowed them to a dining room.\n\n\"Marcia-Joan sits there,\" the major-domo informed him as he moved\ntoward the only chair at the table.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRobert warily retreated to the opposite side of the table and looked\nfor another chair. None was visible.\n\n_Of course_, he thought, trying to be fair. _Why should anybody in\nthis day have more than one chair? Robots don't sit._\n\nHe waited for the major-domo to leave, but it did not. The serving\nrobots finished laying out the dishes and retired to posts along the\nwall. Finally, Robert decided that he would have to make his status\nclear or risk going hungry.\n\n_If I sit down somewhere_, he decided, _it may recognize me as human.\nWhat a stupid machine to have!_\n\nHe started around the end of the table again, but the striped robot\nmoved to intercept him. Robert stopped.\n\n\"Oh, well,\" he sighed, sitting sidewise on a corner of the table.\n\nThe robot hesitated, made one or two false starts in different\ndirections, then halted. The situation had apparently not been\nincluded among its memory tapes. Robert grinned and lifted the cover\nof the nearest platter.\n\nHe managed to eat, despite his ungraceful position and what he\nconsidered the scarcity of the food. Just as he finished the last\ndish, he heard footsteps in the hall.\n\nMarcia-Joan had dressed in a fresh robe, of crimson. Its thinner\nmaterial was gathered at the waist by clasps of gleaming gold. The\narrangement emphasized bodily contours Robert had previously seen only\nin historical films.\n\nHe became aware that she was regarding him with much the same\nsuggestion of helpless dismay as the major-domo.\n\n\"Why, you've eaten it all!\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"All?\" snorted Robert. \"There was hardly any food!\"\n\nMarcia-Joan walked slowly around the table, staring at the empty\ndishes.\n\n\"A few bits of raw vegetables and the tiniest portion of\nprotein-concentrate I ever saw!\" Robert continued. \"Do you call that a\ndinner to serve a guest?\"\n\n\"And I especially ordered two portions--\"\n\n\"Two?\" Robert repeated in astonishment. \"You must visit me sometime.\nI'll show you--\"\n\n\"What's the matter with my food?\" interrupted the girl. \"I follow the\nbest diet advice my robots could find in the city library.\"\n\n\"They should have looked for human diets, not song-birds'.\"\n\nHe lifted a cover in hopes of finding some overlooked morsel, but the\nplatter was bare.\n\n\"No wonder you act so strangely,\" he said. \"You must be suffering from\nmalnutrition. I don't wonder with a skimpy diet like this.\"\n\n\"It's very healthful,\" insisted Marcia-Joan. \"The old film said it was\ngood for the figure, too.\"\n\n\"Not interested,\" grunted Robert. \"I'm satisfied as I am.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes? You look gawky to me.\"\n\n\"_You_ don't,\" retorted Robert, examining her disdainfully. \"You are\nshort and stubby and too plump.\"\n\n\"_Plump?_\"\n\n\"Worse, you're actually fat in lots of places I'm not.\"\n\n\"At least not between the ears!\"\n\nRobert blinked.\n\n\"Wh-wh-WHAT?\"\n\n\"And besides,\" she stormed on, \"those robots you brought are painted\nthe most repulsive colors!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRobert closed his mouth and silently sought the connection.\n\n_Robots?_ he thought. _Not fat, but repulsive colors, she said. What\nhas that to do with food? The woman seems incapable of logic._\n\n\"And furthermore,\" Marcia-Joan was saying, \"I'm not sure I care for\nthe looks of you! Lulu, put him out!\"\n\n\"Who's Lulu?\" demanded Robert.\n\nThen, as the major-domo moved forward, he understood.\n\n\"What a silly name for a robot!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"I suppose you'd call it Robert. Will you go now, or shall I call more\nrobots?\"\n\n\"I am not a fool,\" said Robert haughtily. \"I shall go. Thank you for\nthe disgusting dinner.\"\n\n\"Do not use the front door,\" said the robot. \"Only Marcia-Joan uses\nthat. All robots use other doors.\"\n\nRobert growled, but walked down the hall to the back door. As this\nswung open to permit his passage, he halted.\n\n\"It's dark out there now,\" he complained over his shoulder. \"Don't you\nhave any lights on your grounds? Do you want me to trip over\nsomething?\"\n\n\"Of course I have ground lights!\" shrilled Marcia-Joan. \"I'll show\nyou--not that I care if you trip or not.\"\n\nA moment later, lights concealed among the trees glowed into life.\nRobert walked outside and turned toward the cottage.\n\n_I should have asked her what the colors of my robots had to do with\nit_, he thought, and turned back to re-enter.\n\nHe walked right into the closed door, which failed to open before him,\nthough it had operated smoothly a moment ago.\n\n\"Robots not admitted after dark,\" a mechanical voice informed him.\n\"Return to your stall in the shed.\"\n\n\"Whom do you think you're talking to?\" demanded Robert. \"I'm not one\nof your robots!\"\n\nThere was a pause.\n\n\"Is it Marcia-Joan?\" asked the voice-box, after considerable buzzing\nand whirring.\n\n\"No, I'm Robert.\"\n\nThere was another pause while the mechanism laboriously shifted back\nto its other speech tape. Then: \"Robots not admitted after dark.\nReturn to your stall in the shed.\"\n\nRobert slowly raised both hands to his temples. Lingeringly, he\ndragged them down over his cheeks and under his chin until at last the\nfingers interlaced over his tight lips. After a moment, he let out his\nbreath between his fingers and dropped his hands to his sides.\n\nHe raised one foot to kick, but decided that the door looked too hard.\n\nHe walked away between the beds of flowers, grumbling.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nReaching the vicinity of the cottage, he parted the tall shrubs\nbordering its grounds and looked through carefully before proceeding.\nPleased at the gleam of water, he called Blue Two.\n\n\"Good enough! Put the other robots away for the night. They can trim\nthe edges tomorrow.\"\n\nHe started into the cottage, but his major-domo warned, \"Someone\ncomes.\"\n\nRobert looked around. Through thin portions of the shrubbery, he\ncaught a glimpse of Marcia-Joan's crimson robe, nearly black in the\ndiffused glow of the lights illuminating the grounds.\n\n\"Robert!\" called the girl angrily. \"What are your robots doing? I saw\nthem from my upstairs window--\"\n\n\"Wait there!\" exclaimed Robert as she reached the shrubs.\n\n\"What? Are you trying to tell me where I can go or not go? I--YI!\"\n\nThe shriek was followed by a tremendous splash. Robert stepped forward\nin time to be spattered by part of the flying spray. It was cold.\n\n_Naturally, being drawn from the brook_, he reflected. _Oh, well, the\nsun will warm it tomorrow._\n\nThere was a frenzy of thrashing and splashing in the dimly lighted\nwater at his feet, accompanied by coughs and spluttering demands that\nhe \"do something!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nRobert reached down with one hand, caught his hostess by the wrist,\nand heaved her up to solid ground.\n\n\"My robots are digging you a little swimming hole,\" he told her. \"They\nbrought the water from the brook by a trench. You can finish it with\nconcrete or plastics later; it's only fifteen by thirty feet.\"\n\nHe expected some sort of acknowledgment of his efforts, and peered at\nher through the gloom when none was forthcoming. He thus caught a\nglimpse of the full-swinging slap aimed at his face. He tried to duck.\n\nThere was another splash, followed by more floundering about.\n\n\"Reach up,\" said Robert patiently, \"and I'll pull you out again. I\ndidn't expect you to like it this much.\"\n\nMarcia-Joan scrambled up the bank, tugged viciously at her sodden\nrobe, and headed for the nearest pathway without replying. Robert\nfollowed along.\n\nAs they passed under one of the lights, he noticed that the red\nreflections of the wet material, where it clung snugly to the girl's\nbody, were almost the color of some of his robots.\n\n_The tennis robot_, he thought, _and the moving targets for\narchery--in fact, all the sporting equipment._\n\n\"You talk about food for the figure,\" he remarked lightly. \"You should\nsee yourself now! It's really funny, the way--\"\n\nHe stopped. Some strange emotion stifled his impulse to laugh at the\nway the robe clung.\n\nInstead, he lengthened his stride, but he was still a few feet behind\nwhen she charged through the front entrance of the house. The door,\nhaving opened automatically for her, started to swing closed. Robert\nsprang forward to catch it.\n\n\"Wait a minute!\" he cried.\n\nMarcia-Joan snapped something that sounded like \"Get out!\" over her\nshoulder, and squished off toward the stairs. As Robert started\nthrough the door to follow, the striped robot hastened toward him from\nits post in the hall.\n\n\"Do not use the front door!\" it warned him.\n\n\"Out of my way!\" growled Robert.\n\nThe robot reached out to enforce the command. Robert seized it by the\nforearm and put all his weight into a sudden tug. The machine tottered\noff balance. Releasing his grip, he sent it staggering out the door\nwith a quick shove.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA hasty glance showed Marcia-Joan flapping wetly up the last steps.\nRobert turned to face the robot.\n\n\"Do not use that door!\" he quoted vindictively, and the robot halted\nits rush indecisively. \"Only Marcia-Joan uses it.\"\n\nThe major-domo hesitated. After a moment, it strode off around the\ncorner of the house. First darting one more look at the stairs, Robert\nthrust his head outside and shouted: \"Blue Two!\"\n\nHe held the door open while he waited. There was an answer from the\nshrubbery. Presently, his own supervisor hurried up.\n\n\"Fetch the emergency toolbox!\" Robert ordered. \"And bring a couple of\nothers with you.\"\n\n\"Naturally, Robert. I would not carry it myself.\"\n\nA moment after the robot had departed on the errand, heavy steps\nsounded at the rear of the hall. Marcia-Joan's robot had dealt with\nthe mechanism of the back door.\n\nRobert eyed the metal mask as the robot walked up to him. He found the\ncolor contrast less pleasant than ever.\n\n\"I am not using the door,\" he said hastily. \"I am merely holding it\nopen.\"\n\n\"Do you intend to use it?\"\n\n\"I haven't decided.\"\n\n\"I shall carry you out back,\" the robot decided for him.\n\n\"No, you don't!\" exclaimed Robert, leaping backward.\n\nThe door immediately began to swing shut as he passed through.\n\nCursing, he lunged forward. The robot reached for him.\n\nThis time, Robert missed his grip. Before he could duck away, his\nwrist was trapped in a metal grasp.\n\n_The door will close_, he despaired. _They'll be too late._\n\nThen, suddenly, he felt the portal drawn back and heard Blue Two\nspeak.\n\n\"What does Robert wish?\"\n\n\"Throw this heap out the door!\" gasped Robert.\n\nAmid a trampling of many feet, the major-domo was raised bodily by\nBlue Two and another pair of Robert's machines and hustled outside.\nSince the grip on Robert's wrist was not relaxed, he involuntarily\naccompanied the rush of metal bodies.\n\n\"Catch the door!\" he called to Blue Two.\n\nWhen the latter sprang to obey, the other two took the action as a\nsignal to drop their burden. The pink-and-blue robot landed full\nlength with a jingling crash. Robert was free.\n\nWith the robots, he made for the entrance. Hearing footsteps behind\nhim as the major-domo regained its feet, he slipped hastily inside.\n\n\"Pick up that toolbox!\" he snapped. \"When that robot stops in the\ndoorway, knock its head off!\"\n\nTurning, he held up a finger.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Do not use the front door!\"\n\nThe major-domo hesitated.\n\nThe heavy toolbox in the grip of Blue Two descended with a thud. The\npink-and-blue robot landed on the ground a yard or two outside the\ndoor as if dropped from the second floor. It bounced once, emitted a\nfew sparks and pungent wisps of smoke, lay still.\n\n\"Never mind, that's good enough,\" said Robert as Blue Two stepped\nforward. \"One of the others can drag it off to the repair shop. Have\nthe toolbox brought with us.\"\n\n\"What does Robert wish now?\" inquired Blue Two, trailing the man\ntoward the stairway.\n\n\"I'm going upstairs,\" said Robert. \"And I intend to be prepared if any\nmore doors are closed against me!\"\n\nHe started up, the measured treads of his own robots sounding\nreassuringly behind him....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was about a week later that Robert sat relaxed in the armchair\nbefore his own telescreen, facing Henry's wizened visage.\n\nThe elder man clucked sympathetically as he re-examined the scratches\non Robert's face and the bruise under his right eye.\n\n\"And so you left there in the morning?\"\n\n\"I certainly did!\" declared Robert. \"We registered a marriage record\nat the city library by television, of course, but I don't care if I\nnever see her again. She needn't even tell me about the child, if any.\nI simply can't stand that girl!\"\n\n\"Now, now,\" Henry said.\n\n\"I mean it! Absolutely no consideration for my wishes. Everything in\nthe house was run to suit her convenience.\"\n\n\"After all,\" Henry pointed out, \"it _is_ her house.\"\n\nRobert glared. \"What has that to do with it? I don't think I was as\nunreasonable as she said in smashing that robot. The thing just\nwouldn't let me alone!\"\n\n\"I guess,\" Henry suggested, \"it was conditioned to obey Marcia-Joan,\nnot you.\"\n\n\"Well, that shows you! Whose orders are to count, anyway? When I tell\na robot to do something, I expect it done. How would you like to find\nrobots trying to boss you around?\"\n\n\"Are you talking about robots,\" asked Henry, \"or the girl?\"\n\n\"Same thing, isn't it? Or it would be if I'd decided to bring her home\nwith me.\"\n\n\"Conflict of desires,\" murmured Henry.\n\n\"Exactly! It's maddening to have a perfectly logical action interfered\nwith because there's another person present to insist--_insist_, mind\nyou--on having her way.\"\n\n\"And for twenty-odd years, you've had your own way in every tiny\nthing.\"\n\nSomewhere in the back of Robert's lurked a feeling that Henry sounded\nslightly sarcastic.\n\n\"Well, why shouldn't I?\" he demanded. \"I noticed that in every\ndisagreement, my view was the right one.\"\n\n\"It was?\"\n\n\"Of course it was! What did you mean by that tone?\"\n\n\"Nothing....\" Henry seemed lost in thought. \"I was just wondering how\nmany 'right' views are left on this planet. There must be quite a few,\nall different, even if we have picked up only a few by television. An\ninteresting facet of our peculiar culture--every individual omnipotent\nand omniscient, _within his own sphere_.\"\n\nRobert regarded him with indignant incredulity.\n\n\"You don't seem to understand my point,\" he began again. \"I told her\nwe ought to come to my house, where things are better arranged, and\nshe simply refused. Contradicted me! It was most--\"\n\nHe broke off.\n\n\"The _impudence_ of him!\" he exclaimed. \"Signing off when _I_ wanted\nto talk!\"\n\n                                                           --H. B.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
