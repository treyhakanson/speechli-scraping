But given\n the situation that neither data\n nor time is adequate, and an\n answer must be produced ...\n what do you do?_\n\nBY JAMES BLISH\n\nIllustrated by van Dongen\n\n\nOn the day that the Polish freighter _Ludmilla_ laid an egg in New York\nharbor, Abner Longmans (\"One-Shot\") Braun was in the city going about\nhis normal business, which was making another million dollars. As we\nfound out later, almost nothing else was normal about that particular\nweek end for Braun. For one thing, he had brought his family with him--a\ncomplete departure from routine--reflecting the unprecedentedly\nlegitimate nature of the deals he was trying to make. From every point\nof view it was a bad week end for the CIA to mix into his affairs, but\nnobody had explained that to the master of the _Ludmilla_.\n\nI had better add here that we knew nothing about this until afterward;\nfrom the point of view of the storyteller, an organization like Civilian\nIntelligence Associates gets to all its facts backwards, entering the\ntale at the pay-off, working back to the hook, and winding up with a\nsheaf of background facts to feed into the computer for Next Time. It's\nrough on the various people who've tried to fictionalize what we\ndo--particularly for the lazy examples of the breed, who come to us\nexpecting that their plotting has already been done for them--but it's\ninherent in the way we operate, and there it is.\n\nCertainly nobody at CIA so much as thought of Braun when the news first\ncame through. Harry Anderton, the Harbor Defense chief, called us at\n0830 Friday to take on the job of identifying the egg; this was when our\nrecords show us officially entering the affair, but, of course, Anderton\nhad been keeping the wires to Washington steaming for an hour before\nthat, getting authorization to spend some of his money on us (our\nclearance status was then and is now C&R--clean and routine).\n\nI was in the central office when the call came through, and had some\ndifficulty in making out precisely what Anderton wanted of us. \"Slow\ndown, Colonel Anderton, please,\" I begged him. \"Two or three seconds\nwon't make that much difference. How did you find out about this egg in\nthe first place?\"\n\n\"The automatic compartment bulkheads on the _Ludmilla_ were defective,\"\nhe said. \"It seems that this egg was buried among a lot of other crates\nin the dump-cell of the hold--\"\n\n\"What's a dump cell?\"\n\n\"It's a sea lock for getting rid of dangerous cargo. The bottom of it\nopens right to Davy Jones. Standard fitting for ships carrying\nexplosives, radioactives, anything that might act up unexpectedly.\"\n\n\"All right,\" I said. \"Go ahead.\"\n\n\"Well, there was a timer on the dump-cell floor, set to drop the egg\nwhen the ship came up the river. That worked fine, but the automatic\nbulkheads that are supposed to keep the rest of the ship from being\nflooded while the cell's open, didn't. At least they didn't do a\nthorough job. The _Ludmilla_ began to list and the captain yelled for\nhelp. When the Harbor Patrol found the dump-cell open, they called us\nin.\"\n\n\"I see.\" I thought about it a moment. \"In other words, you don't know\nwhether the _Ludmilla_ really laid an egg or not.\"\n\n\"That's what I keep trying to explain to you, Dr. Harris. We don't know\nwhat she dropped and we haven't any way of finding out. It could be a\nbomb--it could be anything. We're sweating everybody on board the ship\nnow, but it's my guess that none of them know anything; the whole\nprocedure was designed to be automatic.\"\n\n\"All right, we'll take it,\" I said. \"You've got divers down?\"\n\n\"Sure, but--\"\n\n\"We'll worry about the buts from here on. Get us a direct line from\nyour barge to the big board here so we can direct the work. Better get\non over here yourself.\"\n\n\"Right.\" He sounded relieved. Official people have a lot of confidence\nin CIA; too much, in my estimation. Some day the job will come along\nthat we can't handle, and then Washington will be kicking itself--or,\nmore likely, some scapegoat--for having failed to develop a comparable\ngovernment department.\n\nNot that there was much prospect of Washington's doing that. Official\nthinking had been running in the other direction for years. The\nprecedent was the Associated Universities organization which ran\nBrookhaven; CIA had been started the same way, by a loose corporation of\nuniversities and industries all of which had wanted to own an ULTIMAC\nand no one of which had had the money to buy one for itself. The\nEisenhower administration, with its emphasis on private enterprise and\nconcomitant reluctance to sink federal funds into projects of such size,\nhad turned the two examples into a nice fat trend, which ULTIMAC herself\nsaid wasn't going to be reversed within the practicable lifetime of CIA.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI buzzed for two staffers, and in five minutes got Clark Cheyney and\nJoan Hadamard, CIA's business manager and social science division chief\nrespectively. The titles were almost solely for the benefit of the\nT/O--that is, Clark and Joan do serve in those capacities, but said\nservice takes about two per cent of their capacities and their time. I\nshot them a couple of sentences of explanation, trusting them to pick up\nwhatever else they needed from the tape, and checked the line to the\ndivers' barge.\n\nIt was already open; Anderton had gone to work quickly and with decision\nonce he was sure we were taking on the major question. The television\nscreen lit, but nothing showed on it but murky light, striped with\nstreamers of darkness slowly rising and falling. The audio went\n_cloonck_ ... _oing_, _oing_ ... _bonk_ ... _oing_ ... Underwater\nnoises, shapeless and characterless.\n\n\"Hello, out there in the harbor. This is CIA, Harris calling. Come in,\nplease.\"\n\n\"Monig here,\" the audio said. _Boink_ ... _oing_, _oing_ ...\n\n\"Got anything yet?\"\n\n\"Not a thing, Dr. Harris,\" Monig said. \"You can't see three inches in\nfront of your face down here--it's too silty. We've bumped into a couple\nof crates, but so far, no egg.\"\n\n\"Keep trying.\"\n\nCheyney, looking even more like a bulldog than usual, was setting his\nstopwatch by one of the eight clocks on ULTIMAC's face. \"Want me to take\nthe divers?\" he said.\n\n\"No, Clark, not yet. I'd rather have Joan do it for the moment.\" I\npassed the mike to her. \"You'd better run a probability series first.\"\n\n\"Check.\" He began feeding tape into the integrator's mouth. \"What's your\nangle, Peter?\"\n\n\"The ship. I want to see how heavily shielded that dump-cell is.\"\n\n\"It isn't shielded at all,\" Anderton's voice said behind me. I hadn't\nheard him come in. \"But that doesn't prove anything. The egg might have\ncarried sufficient shielding in itself. Or maybe the Commies didn't care\nwhether the crew was exposed or not. Or maybe there isn't any egg.\"\n\n\"All that's possible,\" I admitted. \"But I want to see it, anyhow.\"\n\n\"Have you taken blood tests?\" Joan asked Anderton.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Get the reports through to me, then. I want white-cell counts,\ndifferentials, platelet counts, hematocrit and sed rates on every man.\"\n\nAnderton picked up the phone and I took a firm hold on the doorknob.\n\n\"Hey,\" Anderton said, putting the phone down again. \"Are you going to\nduck out just like that? Remember, Dr. Harris, we've got to evacuate the\ncity first of all! No matter whether it's a real egg or not--we can't\ntake the chance on it's _not_ being an egg!\"\n\n\"Don't move a man until you get a go-ahead from CIA,\" I said. \"For all\nwe know now, evacuating the city may be just what the enemy wants us to\ndo--so they can grab it unharmed. Or they may want to start a panic for\nsome other reason, any one of fifty possible reasons.\"\n\n\"You can't take such a gamble,\" he said grimly. \"There are eight and a\nhalf million lives riding on it. I can't let you do it.\"\n\n\"You passed your authority to us when you hired us,\" I pointed out. \"If\nyou want to evacuate without our O.K., you'll have to fire us first.\nIt'll take another hour to get that cleared from Washington--so you\nmight as well give us the hour.\"\n\nHe stared at me for a moment, his lips thinned. Then he picked up the\nphone again to order Joan's blood count, and I got out the door, fast.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA reasonable man would have said that I found nothing useful on the\n_Ludmilla_, except negative information. But the fact is that anything I\nfound would have been a surprise to me; I went down looking for\nsurprises. I found nothing but a faint trail to Abner Longmans Braun,\nmost of which was fifteen years cold.\n\nThere'd been a time when I'd known Braun, briefly and to no profit to\neither of us. As an undergraduate majoring in social sciences, I'd taken\non a term paper on the old International Longshoreman's Association, a\nracket-ridden union now formally extinct--although anyone who knew the\nsigns could still pick up some traces on the docks. In those days, Braun\nhad been the business manager of an insurance firm, the sole visible\nfunction of which had been to write policies for the ILA and its\nindividual dock-wallopers. For some reason, he had been amused by the\nbrash youngster who'd barged in on him and demanded the lowdown, and had\nshown me considerable lengths of ropes not normally in view of the\npublic--nothing incriminating, but enough to give me a better insight\ninto how the union operated than I had had any right to expect--or even\nsuspect.\n\nHence I was surprised to hear somebody on the docks remark that Braun\nwas in the city over the week end. It would never have occurred to me\nthat he still interested himself in the waterfront, for he'd gone\nrespectable with a vengeance. He was still a professional gambler, and\naccording to what he had told the Congressional Investigating Committee\nlast year, took in thirty to fifty thousand dollars a year at it, but\nhis gambles were no longer concentrated on horses, the numbers, or shady\ninsurance deals. Nowadays what he did was called investment--mostly in\nreal estate; realtors knew him well as the man who had _almost_ bought\nthe Empire State Building. (The _almost_ in the equation stands for the\nmoment when the shoestring broke.)\n\nJoan had been following his career, too, not because she had ever met\nhim, but because for her he was a type study in the evolution of what\nshe called \"the extra-legal ego.\" \"With personalities like that,\nrespectability is a disease,\" she told me. \"There's always an\nalmost-open conflict between the desire to be powerful and the desire to\nbe accepted; your ordinary criminal is a moral imbecile, but people like\nBraun are damned with a conscience, and sooner or later they crack\ntrying to appease it.\"\n\n\"I'd sooner try to crack a Timkin bearing,\" I said. \"Braun's ten-point\nsteel all the way through.\"\n\n\"Don't you believe it. The symptoms are showing all over him. Now he's\nbacking Broadway plays, sponsoring beginning actresses, joining\nplaywrights' groups--he's the only member of Buskin and Brush who's\nnever written a play, acted in one, or so much as pulled the rope to\nraise the curtain.\"\n\n\"That's investment,\" I said. \"That's his business.\"\n\n\"Peter, you're only looking at the surface. His real investments almost\nnever fail. But the plays he backs _always_ do. They have to; he's\nsinking money in them to appease his conscience, and if they were to\nsucceed it would double his guilt instead of salving it. It's the same\nway with the young actresses. He's not sexually interested in them--his\ntype never is, because living a rigidly orthodox family life is part of\nthe effort towards respectability. He's backing them to 'pay his debt to\nsociety'--in other words, they're talismans to keep him out of jail.\"\n\n\"It doesn't seem like a very satisfactory substitute.\"\n\n\"Of course it isn't,\" Joan had said. \"The next thing he'll do is go in\nfor direct public service--giving money to hospitals or something like\nthat. You watch.\"\n\nShe had been right; within the year, Braun had announced the founding of\nan association for clearing the Detroit slum area where he had been\nborn--the plainest kind of symbolic suicide: _Let's not have any more\nAbner Longmans Brauns born down here_. It depressed me to see it happen,\nfor next on Joan's agenda for Braun was an entry into politics as a\nfighting liberal--a New Dealer twenty years too late. Since I'm mildly\nliberal myself when I'm off duty, I hated to think what Braun's career\nmight tell me about my own motives, if I'd let it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll of which had nothing to do with why I was prowling around the\n_Ludmilla_--or did it? I kept remembering Anderton's challenge: \"You\ncan't take such a gamble. There are eight and a half million lives\nriding on it--\" That put it up into Braun's normal operating area, all\nright. The connection was still hazy, but on the grounds that any link\nmight be useful, I phoned him.\n\nHe remembered me instantly; like most uneducated, power-driven men, he\nhad a memory as good as any machine's.\n\n\"You never did send me that paper you was going to write,\" he said. His\nvoice seemed absolutely unchanged, although he was in his seventies now.\n\"You promised you would.\"\n\n\"Kids don't keep their promises as well as they should,\" I said. \"But\nI've still got copies and I'll see to it that you get one, this time.\nRight now I need another favor--something right up your alley.\"\n\n\"CIA business?\"\n\n\"Yes. I didn't know you knew I was with CIA.\"\n\nBraun chuckled. \"I still know a thing or two,\" he said. \"What's the\nangle?\"\n\n\"That I can't tell you over the phone. But it's the biggest gamble there\never was, and I think we need an expert. Can you come down to CIA's\ncentral headquarters right away?\"\n\n\"Yeah, if it's that big. If it ain't, I got lots of business here, Andy.\nAnd I ain't going to be in town long. You're sure it's top stuff?\"\n\n\"My word on it.\"\n\nHe was silent a moment. Then he said, \"Andy, send me your paper.\"\n\n\"The paper? Sure, but--\" Then I got it. I'd given him my word. \"You'll\nget it,\" I said. \"Thanks, Mr. Braun.\"\n\nI called headquarters and sent a messenger to my apartment to look for\none of those long-dusty blue folders with the legal-length sheets inside\nthem, with orders to scorch it over to Braun without stopping to breathe\nmore than once. Then I went back myself.\n\nThe atmosphere had changed. Anderton was sitting by the big desk,\nclenching his fists and sweating; his whole posture telegraphed his\ncontrolled helplessness. Cheyney was bent over a seismograph,\necho-sounding for the egg through the river bottom. If that even had a\nprayer of working, I knew, he'd have had the trains of the Hudson &\nManhattan stopped; their rumbling course through their tubes would have\nblanked out any possible echo-pip from the egg.\n\n\"Wild goose chase?\" Joan said, scanning my face.\n\n\"Not quite. I've got something, if I can just figure out what it is.\nRemember One-Shot Braun?\"\n\n\"Yes. What's he got to do with it?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Nothing,\" I said. \"But I want to bring him in. I don't think we'll lick\nthis project before deadline without him.\"\n\n\"What good is a professional gambler on a job like this? He'll just get\nin the way.\"\n\nI looked toward the television screen, which now showed an amorphous\nblack mass, jutting up from a foundation of even deeper black. \"Is that\noperation getting you anywhere?\"\n\n\"Nothing's gotten us anywhere,\" Anderton interjected harshly. \"We don't\neven know if that's the egg--the whole area is littered with crates.\nHarris, you've got to let me get that alert out!\"\n\n\"Clark, how's the time going?\"\n\nCheyney consulted the stopwatch. \"Deadline in twenty-nine minutes,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"All right, let's use those minutes. I'm beginning to see this thing a\nlittle clearer. Joan, what we've got here is a one-shot gamble; right?\"\n\n\"In effect,\" she said cautiously.\n\n\"And it's my guess that we're never going to get the answer by diving\nfor it--not in time, anyhow. Remember when the Navy lost a barge-load of\nshells in the harbor, back in '52? They scrabbled for them for a year\nand never pulled up a one; they finally had to warn the public that if\nit found anything funny-looking along the shore it shouldn't bang said\nobject, or shake it either. We're better equipped than the Navy was\nthen--but we're working against a deadline.\"\n\n\"If you'd admitted that earlier,\" Anderton said hoarsely, \"we'd have\nhalf a million people out of the city by now. Maybe even a million.\"\n\n\"We haven't given up yet, colonel. The point is this, Joan: what we need\nis an inspired guess. Get anything from the prob series, Clark? I\nthought not. On a one-shot gamble of this kind, the 'laws' of chance are\nno good at all. For that matter, the so-called ESP experiments showed us\nlong ago that even the way we construct random tables is full of\nholes--and that a man with a feeling for the essence of a gamble can\nmake a monkey out of chance almost at will.\n\n\"And if there ever was such a man, Braun is it. That's why I asked him\nto come down here. I want him to look at that lump on the screen\nand--play a hunch.\"\n\n\"You're out of your mind,\" Anderton said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA decorous knock spared me the trouble of having to deny, affirm or\nignore the judgment. It was Braun; the messenger had been fast, and the\ngambler hadn't bothered to read what a college student had thought of\nhim fifteen years ago. He came forward and held out his hand, while the\nothers looked him over frankly.\n\nHe was impressive, all right. It would have been hard for a stranger to\nbelieve that he was aiming at respectability; to the eye, he was already\nthere. He was tall and spare, and walked perfectly erect, not without\nspring despite his age. His clothing was as far from that of a gambler\nas you could have taken it by design: a black double-breasted suit with\na thin vertical stripe, a gray silk tie with a pearl stickpin just\nbarely large enough to be visible at all, a black Homburg; all perfectly\nfitted, all worn with proper casualness--one might almost say a formal\ncasualness. It was only when he opened his mouth that One-Shot Braun was\nin the suit with him.\n\n\"I come over as soon as your runner got to me,\" he said. \"What's the\npitch, Andy?\"\n\n\"Mr. Braun, this is Joan Hadamard, Clark Cheyney, Colonel Anderton. I'll\nbe quick because we need speed now. A Polish ship has dropped something\nout in the harbor. We don't know what it is. It may be a hell-bomb, or\nit may be just somebody's old laundry. Obviously we've got to find out\nwhich--and we want you to tell us.\"\n\nBraun's aristocratic eyebrows went up. \"Me? Hell, Andy, I don't know\nnothing about things like that. I'm surprised with you. I thought CIA\nhad all the brains it needed--ain't you got machines to tell you answers\nlike that?\"\n\nI pointed silently to Joan, who had gone back to work the moment the\nintroductions were over. She was still on the mike to the divers. She\nwas saying: \"What does it look like?\"\n\n\"It's just a lump of something, Dr. Hadamard. Can't even tell its\nshape--it's buried too deeply in the mud.\" _Cloonk_ ... _Oing_, _oing_\n...\n\n\"Try the Geiger.\"\n\n\"We did. Nothing but background.\"\n\n\"Scintillation counter?\"\n\n\"Nothing, Dr. Hadamard. Could be it's shielded.\"\n\n\"Let us do the guessing, Monig. All right, maybe it's got a clockwork\nfuse that didn't break with the impact. Or a gyroscopic fuse. Stick a\nstethoscope on it and see if you pick up a ticking or anything that\nsounds like a motor running.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a lag and I turned back to Braun. \"As you can see, we're\nstymied. This is a long shot, Mr. Braun. One throw of the dice--one\nshow-down hand. We've got to have an expert call it for us--somebody\nwith a record of hits on long shots. That's why I called you.\"\n\n\"It's no good,\" he said. He took off the Homburg, took his handkerchief\nfrom his breast pocket, and wiped the hatband. \"I can't do it.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"It ain't my _kind_ of thing,\" he said. \"Look, I never in my life run\nodds on anything that made any difference. But this makes a difference.\nIf I guess wrong--\"\n\n\"Then we're all dead ducks. But why should you guess wrong? Your hunches\nhave been working for sixty years now.\"\n\nBraun wiped his face. \"No. You don't get it. I wish you'd listen to me.\nLook, my wife and my kids are in the city. It ain't only my life, it's\ntheirs, too. That's what I care about. That's why it's no good. On\nthings that matter to me, _my hunches don't work_.\"\n\nI was stunned, and so, I could see, were Joan and Cheyney. I suppose I\nshould have guessed it, but it had never occurred to me.\n\n\"Ten minutes,\" Cheyney said.\n\nI looked up at Braun. He was frightened, and again I was surprised\nwithout having any right to be. I tried to keep at least my voice calm.\n\n\"Please try it anyhow, Mr. Braun--as a favor. It's already too late to\ndo it any other way. And if you guess wrong, the outcome won't be any\nworse than if you don't try at all.\"\n\n\"My kids,\" he whispered. I don't think he knew that he was speaking\naloud. I waited.\n\nThen his eyes seemed to come back to the present. \"All right,\" he said.\n\"I told you the truth, Andy. Remember that. So--is it a bomb or ain't\nit? That's what's up for grabs, right?\"\n\nI nodded. He closed his eyes. An unexpected stab of pure fright went\ndown my back. Without the eyes, Braun's face was a death mask.\n\nThe water sounds and the irregular ticking of a Geiger counter seemed to\nspring out from the audio speaker, four times as loud as before. I could\neven hear the pen of the seismograph scribbling away, until I looked at\nthe instrument and saw that Clark had stopped it, probably long ago.\n\nDroplets of sweat began to form along Braun's forehead and his upper\nlip. The handkerchief remained crushed in his hand.\n\nAnderton said, \"Of all the fool--\"\n\n\"Hush!\" Joan said quietly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSlowly, Braun opened his eyes. \"All right,\" he said. \"You guys wanted it\nthis way. _I say it's a bomb._\" He stared at us for a moment more--and\nthen, all at once, the Timkin bearing burst. Words poured out of it.\n\"Now you guys do something, do your job like I did mine--get my wife and\nkids out of there--empty the city--do something, _do something_!\"\n\nAnderton was already grabbing for the phone. \"You're right, Mr. Braun.\nIf it isn't already too late--\"\n\nCheyney shot out a hand and caught Anderton's telephone arm by the\nwrist. \"Wait a minute,\" he said.\n\n\"What d'you mean, 'wait a minute'? Haven't you already shot enough\ntime?\"\n\nCheyney did not let go; instead, he looked inquiringly at Joan and said,\n\"One minute, Joan. You might as well go ahead.\"\n\nShe nodded and spoke into the mike. \"Monig, unscrew the cap.\"\n\n\"Unscrew the cap?\" the audio squawked. \"But Dr. Hadamard, if that sets\nit off--\"\n\n\"It won't go off. That's the one thing you can be sure it won't do.\"\n\n\"What is this?\" Anderton demanded. \"And what's this deadline stuff,\nanyhow?\"\n\n\"The cap's off,\" Monig reported. \"We're getting plenty of radiation now.\nJust a minute-- Yeah. Dr. Hadamard, it's a bomb, all right. But it\nhasn't got a fuse. Now how could they have made a fool mistake like\nthat?\"\n\n\"In other words, it's a dud,\" Joan said.\n\n\"That's right, a dud.\"\n\nNow, at last, Braun wiped his face, which was quite gray. \"I told you\nthe truth,\" he said grimly. \"My hunches don't work on stuff like this.\"\n\n\"But they do,\" I said. \"I'm sorry we put you through the wringer--and\nyou too, colonel--but we couldn't let an opportunity like this slip. It\nwas too good a chance for us to test how our facilities would stand up\nin a real bomb-drop.\"\n\n\"A real drop?\" Anderton said. \"Are you trying to say that CIA staged\nthis? You ought to be shot, the whole pack of you!\"\n\n\"No, not exactly,\" I said. \"The enemy's responsible for the drop, all\nright. We got word last month from our man in Gdynia that they were\ngoing to do it, and that the bomb would be on board the _Ludmilla_. As I\nsay, it was too good an opportunity to miss. We wanted to find out just\nhow long it would take us to figure out the nature of the bomb--which we\ndidn't know in detail--after it was dropped here. So we had our people\nin Gdynia defuse the thing after it was put on board the ship, but\notherwise leave it entirely alone.\n\n\"Actually, you see, your hunch was right on the button as far as it\nwent. We didn't ask you whether or not that object was a live bomb. We\nasked whether it was a bomb or not. You said it was, and you were\nright.\"\n\nThe expression on Braun's face was exactly like the one he had worn\nwhile he had been searching for his decision--except that, since his\neyes were open, I could see that it was directed at me. \"If this was the\nold days,\" he said in an ice-cold voice, \"I might of made the colonel's\nidea come true. I don't go for tricks like this, Andy.\"\n\n\"It was more than a trick,\" Clark put in. \"You'll remember we had a\ndeadline on the test, Mr. Braun. Obviously, in a real drop we wouldn't\nhave all the time in the world to figure out what kind of a thing had\nbeen dropped. If we had still failed to establish that when the deadline\nran out, we would have had to allow evacuation of the city, with all the\nattendant risk that that was exactly what the enemy wanted us to do.\"\n\n\"So?\"\n\n\"So we failed the test,\" I said. \"At one minute short of the deadline,\nJoan had the divers unscrew the cap. In a real drop that would have\nresulted in a detonation, if the bomb was real; we'd never risk it. That\nwe did do it in the test was a concession of failure--an admission that\nour usual methods didn't come through for us in time.\n\n\"And that means that you were the only person who did come through, Mr.\nBraun. If a real bomb-drop ever comes, we're going to have to have you\nhere, as an active part of our investigation. Your intuition for the\none-shot gamble was the one thing that bailed us out this time. Next\ntime it may save eight million lives.\"\n\nThere was quite a long silence. All of us, Anderton included, watched\nBraun intently, but his impassive face failed to show any trace of how\nhis thoughts were running.\n\nWhen he did speak at last, what he said must have seemed insanely\nirrelevant to Anderton, and maybe to Cheyney too. And perhaps it meant\nnothing more to Joan than the final clinical note in a case history.\n\n\"It's funny,\" he said, \"I was thinking of running for Congress next year\nfrom my district.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
