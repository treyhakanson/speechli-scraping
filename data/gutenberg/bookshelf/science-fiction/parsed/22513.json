Someone who believes he can do X, when\n he can't, however sincerely he believes it? Or someone who can\n do X, believes he can't, and believes he is pretending he can?_\n\nIllustrated by van Dongen\n\n\n    \"Remembrance and reflection, how allied;\n    What thin partitions sense from thought divide.\"\n\n                                      Pope\n\nWhen I opened the door to my secretary's office, I could see her looking\nup from her desk at the Swami's face with an expression of fascinated\nskepticism. The Swami's back was toward me, and on it hung flowing folds\nof a black cloak. His turban was white, except where it had rubbed\nagainst the back of his neck.\n\n\"A tall, dark, and handsome man will soon come into your life,\" he was\nintoning in that sepulchral voice men habitually use in their dealings\nwith the absolute.\n\nSara's green eyes focused beyond him, on me, and began to twinkle.\n\n\"And there he is right now,\" she commented dryly. \"Mr. Kennedy,\nPersonnel Director for Computer Research.\"\n\nThe Swami whirled around, his heavy robe following the movement in a\npracticed swirl. His liquid black eyes looked me over shrewdly, and he\nbowed toward me as he vaguely touched his chest, lips and forehead. I\nexpected him to murmur, \"Effendi,\" or \"Bwana Sahib,\" or something, but\nhe must have felt silence was more impressive.\n\nI acknowledged his greeting by pulling down one corner of my mouth. Then\nI looked at his companion.\n\nThe young lieutenant was standing very straight, very stiff, and a flush\nof pink was starting up from his collar and spreading around his\nclenched jaws to leave a semicircle of white in front of his red ears.\n\n\"Who are you?\" I asked the lieutenant.\n\n\"Lieutenant Murphy,\" he answered shortly, and managed to open his teeth\na bare quarter of an inch for the words to come out. \"Pentagon!\" His\nlight gray eyes pierced me to see if I were impressed.\n\nI wasn't.\n\n\"Division of Mat\u00e9riel and Supply,\" he continued in staccato, as if he\nwere imitating a machine gun.\n\nI waited. It was obvious he wasn't through yet. He hesitated, and I\ncould see his Adam's apple travel up above the knot of his tie and back\ndown again as he swallowed. The pink flush deepened suddenly into\nbrilliant red and spread all over his face.\n\n\"Poltergeist Section,\" he said defiantly.\n\n\"_What?_\" The exclamation was out before I could catch it.\n\nHe tried to glare at me, but his eyes were pleading instead.\n\n\"General Sanfordwaithe said you'd understand.\" He intended to make it\nmatter of fact in a sturdy, confident voice, but there was the undertone\nof a wail. It was time I lent a hand before his forces were routed and\nleft him shattered in hopeless defeat.\n\n\"You're West Point, aren't you?\" I asked kindly.\n\nIt seemed to remind him of the old shoulder-to-shoulder tradition. He\nstraightened still more. I hadn't believed it possible.\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" He wanted to keep the gratitude out of his voice, but it was\nthere. It did not escape my attention that, for the first time, he had\nspoken the habitual term of respect to me.\n\n\"Well, what do you have here, Lieutenant Murphy?\" I nodded toward the\nSwami who had been wavering between a proud, free stance and that of a\ndrooping supplicant. The lieutenant, whose quality had been recognized,\neven by a civilian, was restored unto himself. He was again ready to do\nor die.\n\n\"According to my orders, sir,\" he said formally, \"you have requested the\nPentagon furnish you with one half dozen, six, male-type poltergeists. I\nam delivering the first of them to you, sir.\"\n\nSara's mouth, hanging wide open, reminded me to close my own.\n\nSo the Pentagon was calling me on my bluff. Well, maybe they did have\nsomething at that. I'd see.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Float me over that ash tray there on the desk,\" I said casually to the\nSwami.\n\nHe looked at me as if I'd insulted him, and I could anticipate some\nreply to the effect that he was not applying for domestic service. But\nthe humble supplicant rather than the proud and fierce hill man won. He\nstarted to pick up the ash tray from Sara's desk with his hand.\n\n\"No, no!\" I exclaimed. \"I didn't ask you to hand it to me. I want you to\nTK it over to me. What's the matter? Can't you even TK a simple ash\ntray?\"\n\nThe lieutenant's eyes were getting bigger and bigger.\n\n\"Didn't your Poltergeist Section test this guy's aptitudes for\ntelekinesis before you brought him from Washington all the way out here\nto Los Angeles?\" I snapped at him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe lieutenant's lips thinned to a bloodless line. Apparently I, a\ncivilian, was criticizing the judgment of the Army.\n\n\"I am certain he must have qualified adequately,\" he said stiffly, and\nthis time left off the \"sir.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know,\" I answered doubtfully. \"If he hasn't even enough\ntelekinetic ability to float me an ash tray across the room--\"\n\nThe Swami recovered himself first. He put the tips of his long fingers\ntogether in the shape of a sway-backed steeple, and rolled his eyes\nupward.\n\n\"I am an instrument of infinite wisdom,\" he intoned. \"Not a parlor\nmagician.\"\n\n\"You mean that with all your infinite wisdom you can't do it,\" I accused\nflatly.\n\n\"The vibrations are not favorable--\" he rolled the words sonorously.\n\n\"All right,\" I agreed. \"We'll go somewhere else, where they're better!\"\n\n\"The vibrations throughout all this crass, materialistic Western\nworld--\" he intoned.\n\n\"All right,\" I interrupted, \"we'll go to India, then. Sara, call up and\nbook tickets to Calcutta on the first possible plane!\" Sara's mouth had\nbeen gradually closing, but it unhinged again.\n\n\"Perhaps not even India,\" the Swami murmured, hastily. \"Perhaps Tibet.\"\n\n\"Now you know we can't get admission into Tibet while the Communists\ncontrol it,\" I argued seriously. \"But how about Nepal? That's a fair\ncompromise. The Maharajadhiraja's friendly now. I'll settle for Nepal.\"\n\nThe Swami couldn't keep the triumphant glitter out of his eyes. The\nsudden worry that I really would take him to India to see if he could TK\nan ash tray subsided. He had me.\n\n\"I'm afraid it would have to be Tibet,\" he said positively. \"Nowhere\nelse in all this troubled world are the vibrations--\"\n\n\"Oh go on back to Flatbush!\" I interrupted disgustedly. \"You know as\nwell as I that you've never been outside New York before in your life.\nYour accent's as phony as the pear-shaped tones of a Midwestern garden\nclub president. Can't even TK a simple ash tray!\"\n\nI turned to the amazed lieutenant.\n\n\"Will you come into my office?\" I asked him.\n\nHe looked over at the Swami, in doubt.\n\n\"He can wait out here,\" I said. \"He won't run away. There isn't any\nsubway, and he wouldn't know what to do. Anyway, if he did get lost,\nyour Army Intelligence could find him. Give G-2 something to work on.\nRight through this door, lieutenant.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" he said meekly, and preceded me into my office.\n\nI closed the door behind us and waved him over to the crying chair. He\nfolded at the knees and hips, as if he were hinged only there, as if\nthere were no hinges at all in the ramrod of his back. He sat up\nstraight, on the edge of his chair, ready to spring into instant charge\nof battle. I went around back to my desk and sat down.\n\n\"Now, lieutenant,\" I said soothingly, \"tell me all about it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI could have sworn his square chin quivered at the note of sympathy in\nmy voice. I wondered, irrelevantly, if the lads at West Point all slept\nwith their faces confined in wooden frames to get that characteristically\nrectangular look.\n\n\"You knew I was from West Point,\" he said, and his voice held a note of\nawe. \"And you knew, right away, that Swami was a phony from Flatbush.\"\n\n\"Come now,\" I said with a shrug. \"Nothing to get mystical about.\nPatterns. Just patterns. Every environment leaves the stamp of its\nmatrix on the individual shaped in it. It's a personnel man's trade to\nrecognize the make of a person, just as you would recognize the make of\na rifle.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. I see, sir,\" he answered. But of course he didn't. And there\nwasn't much use to make him try. Most people cling too desperately to\nthe ego-saving formula: Man cannot know man.\n\n\"Look, lieutenant,\" I said, with an idea that we'd better get down to\nbusiness. \"Have you been checked out on what this is all about?\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" he answered, as if he were answering a question in class,\n\"I was cleared for top security, and told that a few months ago you and\nyour Dr. Auerbach, here at Computer Research, discovered a way to create\nantigravity. I was told you claimed you had to have a poltergeist in the\nprocess. You told General Sanfordwaithe that you needed six of them,\nmales. That's about all, sir. So the Poltergeist Division discovered the\nSwami, and I was assigned to bring him out here to you.\"\n\n\"Well then, Lieutenant Murphy, you go back to the Pentagon and tell\nGeneral Sanfordwaithe that--\" I could see by the look on his face that\nmy message would probably not get through verbatim. \"Never mind, I'll\nwrite it,\" I amended disgustedly. \"And you can carry the message.\"\nLesser echelons do not relish the task of repeating uncomplimentary\nwords verbatim to a superior. Not usually.\n\nI punched Sara's button on my intercom.\n\n\"After all the exposure out there to the Swami,\" I said, \"if you're\nstill with us on this crass, materialistic plane, will you bring your\nbook?\"\n\n\"My astral self has been hovering over you, guarding you, every minute,\"\nSara answered dreamily.\n\n\"Can it take shorthand?\" I asked dryly.\n\n\"Maybe I'd better come in,\" she replied.\n\nWhen she came through the door the lieutenant gave her one appreciative\nglance, then returned to his aloof pedestal of indifference. Obviously\nhis pattern was to stand in majestic splendor and allow the girls to\nfawn somewhere down near his shoes. These lads with a glamour boy\ncomplex almost always gravitate toward some occupation which will\nrequire them to wear a uniform. Sara catalogued him as quickly as I did,\nand seemed unimpressed. But you never can tell about a woman; the\nsmartest of them will fall for the most transparent poses.\n\n\"General Sanfordwaithe, dear sir,\" I began as she sat down at one corner\nof my desk and flipped open her book. \"It takes more than a towel\nwrapped around the head and some mutterings about infinity to get\npoltergeist effects. So I am returning your phony Swami to you with my\ncompliments--\"\n\n\"Beg your pardon, sir,\" the lieutenant interrupted, and there was a\ncertain note of suppressed triumph in his voice. \"In case you rejected\nour applicant for the poltergeist job you have in mind, I was to hand\nyou this.\" He undid a lovingly polished button of his tunic, slipped his\nhand beneath the cloth and pulled forth a long, sealed envelope.\n\nI took it from him and noted the three sealing-wax imprints on the flap.\nFrom being carried so close to his heart for so long, the envelope was\nslightly less crisp than when he had received it. I slipped my letter\nopener in under the side flap, and gently extracted the letter without,\nin anyway, disturbing the wax seals which were to have guaranteed its\nprivacy. There wasn't any point in my doing it, of course, except to\ndemonstrate to the lieutenant that I considered the whole deal as a\nsilly piece of cloak and dagger stuff.\n\nAfter the general formalities, the letter was brief: \"Dear Mr. Kennedy:\nWe already know the Swami is a phony, but our people have been convinced\nthat in spite of this there are some unaccountable effects. We have\nadvised your general manager, Mr. Henry Grenoble, that we are in the act\nof carrying out our part of the agreement, namely, to provide you with\nsix male-type poltergeists, and to both you and him we are respectfully\nsuggesting that you get on with the business of putting the antigravity\nunits into immediate production.\"\n\nI folded the letter and tucked it into one side of my desk pad. I looked\nat Sara.\n\n\"Never mind the letter to General Sanfordwaithe,\" I said. \"He has\nsuccessfully cut off my retreat in that direction.\" I looked over at the\nlieutenant. \"All right,\" I said resignedly, \"I'll apologize to the\nSwami, and make a try at using him.\"\n\nI picked up the letter again and pretended to be reading it. But this\nwas just a stall, because I had suddenly been struck by the thought that\nmy extreme haste in scoring off the Swami and trying to get rid of him\nwas because I didn't want to get involved again with poltergeists. Not\nany, of any nature.\n\nThe best way on earth to avoid having to explain psi effects and come to\nterms with them is simply to deny them, convince oneself that they don't\nexist. I sighed deeply. It looked as if I would be denied that little\nhuman privilege of closing my eyes to the obvious.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOld Stone Face, our general manager, claimed to follow the philosophy of\nbuilding men, not machines. To an extent he did. His favorite phrase\nwas, \"Don't ask me how. I hired you to tell me.\" He hired a man to do a\njob, and I will say for him, he left that man alone as long as the job\ngot done. But when a man flubbed a job, and kept on flubbing it, then\nMr. Henry Grenoble stepped in and carried out his own job--general\nmanaging.\n\nHe had given me the assignment of putting antigrav units into\nproduction. He had given me access to all the money I would need for the\npurpose. He had given me sufficient time, months of it. And, in spite of\nall this co\u00f6peration, he still saw no production lines which spewed out\nantigrav units at some such rate as seventeen and five twelfths per\nsecond.\n\nApparently he got his communication from the Pentagon about the time I\ngot mine. Apparently it contained some implication that Computer\nResearch, under his management, was not pursuing the cause of\nmanufacturing antigrav units with diligence and dispatch. Apparently he\ndid not like this.\n\nI had no more than apologized to the Swami, and received his martyred\nforgiveness, and arranged for a hotel suite for him and the lieutenant,\nwhen Old Stone Face sent for me. He began to manage with diligence and\ndispatch.\n\n\"Now you look here, Kennedy,\" he said forcefully, and his use of my last\nname, rather than my first, was a warning, \"I've given you every chance.\nWhen you and Auerbach came up with that antigrav unit last fall, I\ndidn't ask a lot of fool questions. I figured you knew what you were\ndoing. But the whole winter has passed, and here it is spring, and you\nhaven't done anything that I can see. I didn't say anything when you\ntold General Sanfordwaithe that you'd have to have poltergeists to carry\non the work, but I looked it up. First I thought you'd flipped your lid,\nthen I thought you were sending us all on a wild goose chase so we'd\nleave you alone, then I didn't know what to think.\"\n\nI nodded. He wasn't through.\n\n\"Now I think you're just pretending the whole thing doesn't exist\nbecause you don't want to fool with it.\"\n\nPerhaps he had come to the right decision after all. I'd resolutely\nwashed the whole thing out of my mind. But I wasn't going to get away\nwith it. I could see it coming.\n\n\"For the first time, Kennedy, I'm asking you what happened?\" he said\nfirmly, but his tone was more telling than asking. So I was going to\nhave to discuss frameworks with Old Stone Face, after all.\n\n\"Henry,\" I asked slowly, \"have you kept up your reading in theoretical\nphysics?\"\n\nHe blinked at me. I couldn't tell whether it meant yes or no.\n\n\"When we went to school, you and I--\" I hoped my putting us both in the\nsame age group would tend to mollify him a little, \"physics was all\nsnug, secure, safe, definite. A fact was a fact, and that's all there\nwas to it. But there's been some changes made. There's the co\u00f6rdinate\nsystems of Einstein, where the relationships of facts can change from\nframework to framework. There's the application of multivalued logic to\nphysics where a fact becomes not a fact any longer. The astronomers talk\nabout the expanding universe--it's a piker compared to man's expanding\nconcepts about that universe.\"\n\nHe waited for more. His face seemed to indicate that I was beating\naround the bush.\n\n\"That all has a bearing on what happened,\" I assured him. \"You have to\nunderstand what was behind the facts before you can understand the facts\nthemselves. First, we weren't trying to make an antigrav unit at all.\nDr. Auerbach was playing around with a chemical approach to cybernetics.\nHe made up some goop which he thought would store memory impulses, the\nway the brain stores them. He brought a plastic cylinder of it over to\nme, so I could discuss it with you. I laid it on my desk while I went on\nwith my personnel management business at hand.\"\n\nOld Stone Face opened a humidor and took out a cigar. He lit it slowly\nand deliberately and looked at me sharply as he blew out the first puff\nof smoke.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The nursery over in the plant had been having trouble with a little\ngirl, daughter of one of our production women. She'd been throwing\nthings, setting things on fire. The teachers didn't know how she did it,\nshe just did it. They sent her to me. I asked her about it. She threw a\ntantrum, and when it was all over, Auerbach's plastic cylinder of goop\nwas trying to fall upward, through the ceiling. That's what happened,\" I\nsaid.\n\nHe looked at his cigar, and looked at me. He waited for me to tie the\nfacts to the theory. I hesitated, and then tried to reassure myself.\nAfter all, we were in the business of manufacturing computers. The\ngeneral manager ought to be able to understand something beyond primary\narithmetic.\n\n\"Jennie Malasek was a peculiar child with a peculiar background,\" I went\non. \"Her mother was from the old country, one of the Slav races. There's\nthe inheritance of a lot of peculiar notions. Maybe she had passed them\non to her daughter. She kept Jennie locked up in their room. The kid\nnever got out with other children. Children, kept alone, never seeing\nanybody, get peculiar notions all by themselves. Who, knows what kind of\na co\u00f6rdinate system she built up, or how it worked? Her mother would\ncome home at night and go about her tasks talking aloud, half to the\ndaughter, half to herself. 'I really burned that foreman up, today,'\nshe'd say. Or, 'Oh, boy, was he fired in a hurry!' Or, 'She got herself\nthrown out of the place,' things like that.\"\n\n\"So what does that mean, Ralph?\" he asked. His switch to my first name\nindicated he was trying to work with me instead of pushing me.\n\n\"To a child who never knew anything else,\" I answered, \"one who had\nnever learned to distinguish reality from unreality--as we would define\nit from our agreed framework--a special co\u00f6rdinate system might be built\nup where 'Everybody was up in the air at work, today,' might be taken\nliterally. Under the old systems of physics that couldn't happen, of\ncourse--it says in the textbooks--but since it has been happening all\nthrough history, in thousands of instances, in the new systems of\nmultivalued physics we recognize it. Under the old system, we already\nhad all the major answers, we thought. Now that we've got our smug\ncertainties knocked out of us, we're just fumbling along, trying to get\nsome of the answers we thought we had.\n\n\"We couldn't make that cylinder activate others. We tried. We're still\ntrying. In ordinary cybernetics you can have one machine punch a tape\nand it can be fed into another machine, but that means you first have to\nknow how to code and decode a tape mechanically. We don't know how to\ncode or decode a psi effect. We know the Auerbach cylinder will store a\npsi impulse, but we don't know how. So we have to keep working with psi\ngifted people, at least until we've established some of the basic laws\ngoverning psi.\"\n\nI couldn't tell by Henry's face whether I was with him or away from him.\nHe told me he wanted to think about it, and made a little motion with\nhis hand that I should leave the room.\n\nI walked through the suite of executive offices and down a sound\nrebuffing hallway. The throbbing clatter of manufacture of metallic\nparts made a welcome sound as I went through the far doorway into the\nfactory. I saw a blueprint spread on a foreman's desk as I walked past.\nGood old blueprint. So many millimeters from here to there, made of such\nand such an alloy, a hole punched here with an allowance of\nfive-ten-thousandths plus or minus tolerance. Snug, secure, safe. I\nwondered if psi could ever be blue-printed. Or suppose you put a hole\nhere, but when you looked away and then looked back it had moved, or\nwasn't there at all?\n\n[Illustration]\n\nQuickly, I got myself into a conversation with a supervisor about the\nrising rate of employee turnover in his department. That was something\nalso snug, secure, safe. All you had to do was figure out human beings.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI spent the rest of the morning on such pursuits, working with things I\nunderstood.\n\nOn his first rounds of the afternoon, the interoffice messenger brought\nme a memorandum from the general manager's office. I opened it with some\nmisgivings. I was not particularly reassured.\n\nMr. Grenoble felt he should work with me more closely on the antigrav\nproject. He understood, from his researches, that the most positive psi\neffects were experienced during a seance with a medium. Would I kindly\narrange for the Swami to hold a seance that evening, after office hours,\nso that he might analyze the man's methods and procedures to see how\nthey could fit smoothly into Company Operation. This was not to be\nconstrued as interference in the workings of my department but in the\ninterests of pursuing the entire matter with diligence and dispatch--\n\nThe seance was to be held in my office.\n\nI had had many peculiar conferences in this room--from union leaders\nstripping off their coats, throwing them on the floor and stomping on\nthem; to uplifters who wanted to ban cosmetics on our women employees so\nthe male employees would not be tempted to think Questionable Thoughts.\nI could not recall ever having held a seance before.\n\nMy desk had been moved out of the way, over into one corner of the large\nroom. A round table was brought over from the salesmen's report writing\nroom (used there more for surreptitious poker playing than for writing\nreports) and placed in the middle of my office--on the grounds that it\nhad no sharp corners to gouge people in their middles if it got to\ncavorting about recklessly. In an industrial plant one always has to\nconsider the matter of safety rules and accident insurance rates.\n\nIn the middle of the table there rested, with dark fluid gleaming\nthrough clear plastic cases, six fresh cylinders which Auerbach had\nprepared in his laboratory over in the plant.\n\nAuerbach had shown considerable unwillingness to attend the seance; he\npleaded being extra busy with experiments just now, but I gave him that\nlook which told him I knew he had just been stalling around the last few\nmonths, the same as I had.\n\nIf the psi effect had never come out in the first place, there wouldn't\nhave been any mental conflict. He could have gone on with his processes\nof refining, simplifying and increasing the efficiency ratings of his\ngoop. But this unexpected side effect, the cylinders learning and\ndemonstrating something he considered basically untrue, had tied his\nhands with a hopeless sort of frustration. He would have settled gladly\nfor a chemical compound which could have added two and two upon request;\nbut when that compound can learn and demonstrate that there's no such\nthing as gravity, teaching it simple arithmetic is like ashes in the\nmouth.\n\nI said as much to him. I stood there in his laboratory, leaned up\nagainst a work bench, and risked burning an acid hole in the sleeve of\nmy jacket just to put over an air of unconcern. He was perched on the\nedge of an opposite work bench, swinging his feet, and hiding the\nexpression in his eyes behind the window's reflection upon his polished\nglasses. I said even more.\n\n\"You know,\" I said reflectively, \"I'm completely unable to understand\nthe attitude of supposedly unbiased men of science. Now you take all\nthat mass of data about psi effects, the odd and unexplainable\nhappenings, the premonitions, the specific predictions, the accurate\ndescriptions of far away simultaneously happening events. You take that\nwhole mountainous mass of data, evidence, phenomena--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA slight turn of his head gave me a glimpse of his eyes behind the\nglasses. He looked as if he wished I'd change the subject. In his dry,\nundemonstrative way, I think he liked me. Or at least he liked me when I\nwasn't trying to make him think about things outside his safe and secure\nlittle framework. But I didn't give in. If men of science are not going\nto take up the evidence and work it over, then where are we? And are\nthey men of science?\n\n\"Before Rhine came along, and brought all this down to the level of\nlaboratory experimentation,\" I pursued, \"how were those things to be\nexplained? Say a fellow had some unusual powers, things that happened\naround him, things he knew without any explanation for knowing them.\nI'll tell you. There were two courses open to him. He could express it\nin the semantics of spiritism, or he could admit to witchcraft and\nsorcery. Take your pick; those were the only two systems of semantics\nwhich had been built up through the ages.\n\n\"We've got a third one now--parapsychology. If I had asked you to attend\nan experiment in parapsychology, you'd have agreed at once. But when I\nask you to attend a seance, you balk! Man, what difference does it make\nwhat we call it? Isn't it up to us to investigate the evidence wherever\nwe find it? No matter what kind of semantic debris it's hiding in?\"\n\nAuerbach shoved himself down off the bench, and pulled out a beat-up\npackage of cigarettes.\n\n\"All right, Kennedy,\" he had said resignedly, \"I'll attend your seance.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe other invited guests were Sara, Lieutenant Murphy, Old Stone Face,\nmyself, and, of course, the Swami. This was probably not typical of the\nSwami's usual audience composition.\n\nSix chairs were placed at even intervals around the table. I had found\nsoft white lights overhead to be most suitable for my occasional night\nwork, but the Swami insisted that a blue light, a dim one, was most\nsuitable for his night work.\n\nI made no objection to that condition. One of the elementary basics of\nscience is that laboratory conditions may be varied to meet the\nnecessities of the experiment. If a red-lighted darkness is necessary to\nan operator's successful development of photographic film, then I could\nhardly object to a blue-lighted darkness for the development of the\nSwami's effects.\n\nNeither could I object to the Swami's insistence that he sit with his\nback to the true North. When he came into the room, accompanied by\nLieutenant Murphy, his thoughts seemed turned in upon himself, or wafted\nsomewhere out of this world. He stopped in mid-stride, struck an\nattitude of listening, or feeling, perhaps, and slowly shifted his body\nback and forth.\n\n\"Ah,\" he said at last, in a tone of satisfaction, \"there is the North!\"\n\nIt was, but this was not particularly remarkable. There is no confusing\nmaze of hallways leading to the Personnel Department from the outside.\nApplicants would be unable to find us if there were. If he had got his\nbearings out on the street, he could have managed to keep them.\n\nHe picked up the nearest chair with his own hands and shifted it so that\nit would be in tune with the magnetic lines of Earth. I couldn't object.\nThe Chinese had insisted upon such placement of household articles,\nparticularly their beds, long before the Earth's magnetism had been\ndiscovered by science. The birds had had their direction-finders attuned\nto it, long before there was man.\n\nInstead of objecting, the lieutenant and I meekly picked up the table\nand shifted it to the new position. Sara and Auerbach came in as we were\nsetting the table down. Auerbach gave one quick look at the Swami in his\nblack cloak and nearly white turban, and then looked away.\n\n\"Remember semantics,\" I murmured to him, as I pulled out Sara's chair\nfor her. I seated her to the left of the Swami. I seated Auerbach to the\nright of him. If the lieutenant was, by chance, in cahoots with the\nSwami, I would foil them to the extent of not letting them sit side by\nside at least. I sat down at the opposite side of the table from the\nSwami. The lieutenant sat down between me and Sara.\n\nThe general manager came through the door at that instant, and took\ncharge immediately.\n\n\"All right now,\" Old Stone Face said crisply, in his low, rumbling\nvoice, \"no fiddle-faddling around. Let's get down to business.\"\n\nThe Swami closed his eyes.\n\n\"Please be seated,\" he intoned to Old Stone Face. \"And now, let us all\njoin hands in an unbroken circle.\"\n\nHenry shot him a beetle-browed look as he sat down between Auerbach and\nme, but at least he was co\u00f6perative to the extent that he placed both\nhis hands on top of the table. If Auerbach and I reached for them, we\nwould be permitted to grasp them.\n\nI leaned back and snapped off the overhead light to darken the room in\nan eerie, blue glow.\n\nWe sat there, holding hands, for a full ten minutes. Nothing happened.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was not difficult to estimate the pattern of Henry's mind. Six\npersons, ten minutes, equals one man-hour. One man-hour of idle time to\nbe charged into the cost figure of the antigrav unit. He was staring\nfixedly at the cylinders which lay in random positions in the center of\nthe table, as if to assess their progress at this processing point. He\napparently began to grow dissatisfied with the efficiency rating of the\nmanufacturing process at this point. He stirred restlessly in his chair.\n\nThe Swami seemed to sense the impatience, or it might have been\ncoincidence.\n\n\"There is some difficulty,\" he gasped in a strangulated, high voice. \"My\nguides refuse to come through.\"\n\n\"Harrumph!\" exclaimed Old Stone Face. It left no doubt about what _he_\nwould do if _his_ guides did not obey orders on the double.\n\n\"Someone in this circle is not a True Believer!\" the Swami accused in an\nincredulous voice.\n\nIn the dim blue light I was able to catch a glimpse of Sara's face. She\nwas on the verge of breaking apart. I managed to catch her eye and flash\nher a stern warning. Later she told me she had interpreted my expression\nas stark fear, but it served the same purpose. She smothered her\nlaughter in a most unladylike sound somewhere between a snort and a\nsquawk.\n\nThe Swami seemed to become aware that somehow he was not holding his\naudience spellbound.\n\n\"Wait!\" he commanded urgently; then he announced in awe-stricken tones,\n\"I feel a presence!\"\n\nThere was a tentative, half-hearted rattle of some castanets--which\ncould have been managed by the Swami wiggling one knee, if he happened\nto have them concealed there. This was followed by the thin squawk of a\nbugle--which could have been accomplished by sitting over toward one\nside and squashing the air out of a rubber bulb attached to a ten-cent\nparty horn taped to his thigh.\n\nThen there was nothing. Apparently his guides had made a tentative\nappearance and were, understandably, completely intimidated by Old Stone\nFace. We sat for another five minutes.\n\n\"Harrumph!\" Henry cleared his throat again, this time louder and more\ncommanding.\n\n\"That is all,\" the Swami said in a faint, exhausted voice. \"I have\nreturned to you on your material plane.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe handholding broke up in the way bits of metal, suddenly charged\npositive and negative, would fly apart. I leaned back again and snapped\non the white lights. We all sat there a few seconds, blinking in what\nseemed a sudden glare.\n\nThe Swami sat with his chin dropped down to his chest. Then he raised\nstricken, liquid eyes.\n\n\"Oh, now I remember where I am,\" he said. \"What happened? I never know.\"\n\nOld Stone Face threw him a look of withering scorn. He picked up one of\nthe cylinders and hefted it in the palm of his hand. It did not fly\nupward to bang against the ceiling. It weighed about what it ought to\nweigh. He tossed the cylinder contemptuously, back into the pile,\nscattering them over the table. He pushed back his chair, got to his\nfeet, and stalked out of the room without looking at any of us.\n\nThe Swami made a determined effort to recapture the spotlight.\n\n\"I'm afraid I must have help to walk to the car,\" he whispered. \"I am\ncompletely exhausted. Ah, this work takes so much out of me. Why do I go\non with it? Why? Why? Why?\"\n\nHe drooped in his chair, then made a valiantly brave effort to rise\nunder his own power when he felt the lieutenant's hands lifting him up.\nHe was leaning heavily on the lieutenant as they went out the door.\n\nSara looked at me dubiously.\n\n\"Will there be anything else?\" she asked. Her tone suggested that since\nnothing had been accomplished, perhaps we should get some work out\nbefore she left.\n\n\"No, Sara,\" I answered. \"Good night. See you in the morning.\"\n\nShe nodded and went out the door.\n\nApparently none of them had seen what I saw. I wondered if Auerbach had.\nHe was a trained observer. He was standing beside the table looking down\nat the cylinders. He reached over and poked at one of them with his\nforefinger. He was pushing it back and forth. It gave him no resistance\nbeyond normal inertia. He pushed it a little farther out of parallel\nwith true North. It did not try to swing back.\n\nSo he had seen it. When I'd laid the cylinders down on the table they\nwere in random positions. During the seance there had been no jarring of\nthe table, not even so much as a rap or quiver which could have been\ncaused by the Swami's lifted knee. When we'd shifted the table, after\nthe Swami had changed his chair, the cylinders hadn't been disturbed.\nWhen Old Stone Face had been staring at them during the seance--seance?,\nhah!--they were laying in inert, random positions.\n\nBut when the lights came back on, and just before Henry had picked one\nup and tossed it back to scatter them, every cylinder had been laying in\norderly parallel--and with one end pointing to true North!\n\nI stood there beside Auerbach, and we both poked at the cylinders some\nmore. They gave us no resistance, nor showed that they had any ideas\nabout it one way or the other.\n\n\"It's like so many things,\" I said morosely. \"If you do just happen to\nnotice anything out of the ordinary at all, it doesn't seem to mean\nanything.\"\n\n\"Maybe that's because you're judging it outside of its own framework,\"\nAuerbach answered. I couldn't tell whether he was being sarcastic or\nspeculative. \"What I don't understand,\" he went on, \"is that once the\ncylinders having been activated by whatever force there was in\naction--all right, call it psi--well, why didn't they retain it, the way\nthe other cylinders retained the antigrav force?\"\n\nI thought for a moment. Something about the conditional setup seemed to\ngive me an idea.\n\n\"You take a photographic plate,\" I reasoned. \"Give it a weak exposure to\nlight, then give it a strong blast of overexposure. The first exposure\nis going to be blanked out by the second. Old Stone Face was feeling\npretty strongly toward the whole matter.\"\n\nAuerbach looked at me, unbelieving.\n\n\"There isn't any rule about who can have psi talent,\" I argued. \"I'm\njust wondering if I shouldn't wire General Sanfordwaithe and tell him\nto cut our order for poltergeists down to five.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI spent a glum, restless night. I knew, with certainty, that Old Stone\nFace was going to give me trouble. I didn't need any psi talent for\nthat, it was an inevitable part of his pattern. He had made up his mind\nto take charge of this antigrav operation, and he wouldn't let one bogus\nseance stop him more than momentarily.\n\nIf it weren't so close to direct interference with my department, I'd\nhave been delighted to sit on the side lines and watch him try to\ncommand psi effects to happen. That would be like commanding some random\ncopper wire and metallic cores to start generating electricity.\n\nFor once I could have overlooked the interference with my department if\nI didn't know, from past experience, that I'd be blamed for the\nconsequent failure. That's a cute little trick of top executives,\ngenerally. They get into something they don't understand, really louse\nit up, then, because it is your department, you are the one who failed.\nOrdinarily I liked my job, but if this sort of thing went too far--\n\nBut more than saving my job, I had the feeling that if I were allowed to\ngo along, carefully and experimentally, I just might discover a few of\nthe laws about psi. There was the tantalizing feeling that I was on the\nverge of knowing at least something.\n\nThe Pentagon people had been right. The Swami was an obvious phony of\nthe baldest fakery, yet he had something. He had something, but how was\nI to get hold of it? Just what kind of turns with what around what did\nyou make to generate a psi force? It took two thousand years for man to\nmove from the concept that amber was a stone with a soul to the concept\nof static electricity. Was there any chance I could find some shortcuts\nin reducing the laws governing psi? The one bright spot of my morning\nwas that Auerbach hadn't denied seeing the evidence of the cylinders\npointing North.\n\nIt turned out to be the only bright spot. I had no more than got to my\noffice and sorted out the routine urgencies which had to be handled\nimmediately from those which could be put off a little longer, when Sara\nannounced the lieutenant and the Swami. So I put everything else off,\nand told her to send them right in.\n\nThe Swami was in an incoherent rage. The lieutenant was contracting his\neyebrows in a scowl and clenching his fists in frustration. In a voice,\nsoaring into the falsetto, the Swami demanded that he be sent back to\nBrooklyn where he was appreciated. The lieutenant had orders to stay\nwith the Swami, but he didn't have any orders about returning either to\nBrooklyn or the Pentagon. I managed, at last, to get the lieutenant\nseated in a straight chair, but the Swami couldn't stay still long\nenough. He stalked up and down the room, swirling his slightly odorous\nblack cloak on the turns. Gradually the story came out.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOld Stone Face, a strong advocate of Do It Now, hadn't wasted any time.\nFrom his home he had called the Swami at his hotel and commanded him to\nreport to the general manager's office at once. Apparently they both got\nthere about the same time, and Henry had waded right in.\n\nApparently Henry, too, had spent a restless night. He accused the Swami\nof inefficiency, bungling, fraud, deliberate insubordination, and a few\nother assorted faults for having made a fool out of us all at the\nseance. He'd as much as commanded the Swami to cut out all this\nshilly-shallying and get down to the business of activating antigrav\ncylinders, or else. He hadn't been specific about what the \"or else\"\nwould entail.\n\nIt was up to me to pick up the pieces, if I could.\n\n\"Now I'm sure he really didn't mean--\" I began to pour oil on the\ntroubled waters. \"With your deep insight, Swami--The fate of great\nmartyrs throughout the ages--\" Gradually the ego-building phrases calmed\nhim down. He grew willing to listen, if for no more than the\nanticipation of hearing more of them.\n\nHe settled down into the crying chair at last, and I could see his\nvalence shifting from outraged anger to a vast and noble forgiveness.\nThis much was not difficult. To get him to co\u00f6perate, consciously and\nenthusiastically, well that might not be so easy.\n\nEach trade has its own special techniques. The analytical chemist has a\nseries of routines he tries when he wishes to reduce an unknown compound\nto its constituents. To the chemically uneducated, this may appear to be\na fumbling, hit or miss, kind of procedure. The personnel man, too, has\nhis series of techniques. It may appear to be no more than random,\npointless conversation.\n\nI first tried the routine process of reasoning. I didn't expect it to\nwork; it seldom does, but it can't be eliminated until it has been\ntested.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You must understand,\" I said slowly, soothingly, \"that our intentions\nare constructive. We are simply trying to apply the scientific method to\nsomething which has, heretofore, been wrapped in mysticism.\"\n\nThe shocked freezing of his facial muscles told me that reasoning had\nmissed its mark. It told me more.\n\n\"Science understands nothing, nothing at all!\" he snapped, \"Science\ntries to reduce everything to test tubes and formulae; but I am the\ninstrument of a mystery which man can never know.\"\n\n\"Well, now,\" I said reasonably. \"Let us not be inconsistent. You say\nthis is something man was not meant to know; yet you, yourself, have\ndevoted your life to gaining a greater comprehension of it.\"\n\n\"I seek only to rise above my material self so that I might place\nmyself in harmony with the flowing symphony of Absolute Truth,\" he\nlectured me sonorously. Oh well, his enrapturement with such terminology\ndiffered little from some of the sciences which tended to grow equally\nesoteric. And maybe it meant something. Who was I to say that mine ears\nalone heard all the music being played?\n\nIt did mean one thing very specifically. There are two basic approaches\nto the meaning of life and the universe about us. Man can know: That is\nthe approach of science, its whole meaning. There are mysteries which\nman was not meant to know: That is the other approach. There is no\nreconciling of the two on a reasoning basis. I represented the former. I\nwasn't sure the Swami was a true representative of the latter, but at\nleast he had picked up the valence and the phrases.\n\nI made a mental note that reasoning was an unworkable technique with\nthis compound. Henry, a past master at it, had already tried threats and\nabuse. That hadn't worked. I next tried one of the oldest forms in the\nteaching of man, a parable.\n\nI told him of my old Aunt Dimity, who was passionately fond of Rummy,\nbut considered all other card games sinful.\n\n\"Ah, how well she proves my point,\" the Swami countered. \"There is an\ninner voice, a wisdom greater than the mortal mind to guide us--\"\n\n\"Well now,\" I asked reasonably, \"why would the inner voice say that\nRummy was O.K., but Casino wasn't?\" But it was obvious he liked the\npoint he had made better than he had liked the one I failed to make.\n\nSo I tried the next technique. I tried an appeal for instruction. Often\nan opponent will come over to your side if you just confess, honestly,\nthat he is a better man than you are, and you need his help. What was\nthe road I must take to achieve the same understanding he had achieved?\nHis eyes glittered at that, and a mercenary expression underlay the tone\nof his answer.\n\n\"First there is fasting, and breathing, and contemplating self,\" he\nmurmured mendaciously. \"I would be unable to aid you until you gave me\nfull ascendancy over you, so that I might guide your every thought--\"\n\nI decided to try inspiration. In breaking down recalcitrant materials in\nthe laboratory of my personnel office, sometimes one method worked,\nsometimes another.\n\n\"Do you realize, Swami,\" I asked, \"that the one great drawback\nthroughout the ages to a full acceptance of psi is the lack of permanent\nevidence? It has always been evanescent, perishable. It always rests\nsolely upon the word of witnesses. But if I could show you a film print,\nthen you could not doubt the existence of photography, could you?\"\n\nI opened my lower desk drawer and pulled out a couple of the Auerbach\ncylinders which we had used the night before. I laid them on top of the\ndesk.\n\n\"These cylinders,\" I said, \"act like the photographic film. They will\nrecord, in permanent form, the psi effects you command. At last, for all\nmankind the doubt will be stilled; man will at once know the truth; and\nyou will take your place among the immortals.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nI thought it was pretty good, and that, with his overweening ego, it\nwould surely do the trick. But the Swami was staring at the cylinders\nfirst in fascination, then fear, then in horror. He jumped to his feet,\nwithout bothering to swirl his robe majestically, rushed over to the\ndoor, fumbled with the knob as if he were in a burning room, managed to\nget the door open, and rushed outside. The lieutenant gave me a puzzled\nlook, and went after him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI drew a deep breath, and exhaled it audibly. My testing procedures\nhadn't produced the results I'd expected, but the last one had revealed\nsomething else.\n\nThe Swami believed himself to be a fraud!\n\nAs long as he could razzle-dazzle with sonorous phrases, and depend upon\ncredulous old women to turn them into accurate predictions of things to\ncome, he was safe enough. But faced with something which would prove\ndefinitely--\n\nWell, what would he do now?\n\nAnd then I noticed that both cylinders were pointing toward the door. I\nwatched them, at first, not quite sure; then I grew convinced by the\nchange in their perspective with the angles of the desk. Almost as\nslowly as the minute hand of a watch, they were creeping across the desk\ntoward the door. They, too, were trying to escape from the room.\n\nI nudged them with my fingers. They hustled along a little faster, as if\nappreciative of the help, even coming from me. I saw they were moving\nfaster, as if they were learning as they tried it. I turned one of them\naround. Slowly it turned back and headed for the door again. I lifted\none of them to the floor. It had no tendency to float, but it kept\nheading for the door. The other one fell off the desk while I was\nfooling with the first one. The jar didn't seem to bother it any. It,\ntoo, began to creep across the rug toward the door.\n\nI opened the door for them. Sara looked up. She saw the two cylinders\ncome into view, moving under their own power.\n\n\"Here we go again,\" she said, resignedly.\n\nThe two cylinders pushed themselves over the door sill, got clear\noutside my office. Then they went inert. Both Sara and I tried nudging\nthem, poking them. They just lay there; mission accomplished. I carried\nthem back inside my office and lay them on the floor. Immediately both\nof them began to head for the door again.\n\n\"Simple,\" Sara said dryly, \"they just can't stand to be in the same room\nwith you, that's all.\"\n\n\"You're not just whistling, gal,\" I answered. \"That's the whole point.\"\n\n\"Have I said something clever?\" she asked seriously.\n\nI took the cylinders back into my office and put them in a desk drawer.\nI watched the desk for a while, but it didn't change position.\nApparently it was too heavy for the weak force activating the cylinders.\n\nI picked up the phone and called Old Stone Face. I told him about the\ncylinders.\n\n\"There!\" he exclaimed with satisfaction. \"I knew all that fellow needed\nwas a good old-fashioned talking to. Some day, my boy, you'll realize\nthat you still have a lot to learn about handling men.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" I answered.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSara asked me if I were ready to start seeing people, and I told her I\nwasn't, that I had some thinking to do. She quipped something about\nmaking the world wait, meaning that I should be occupying my time with\npersonnel managing, and closed the door.\n\nAt that, Old Stone Face had a point. If he hadn't got in and riled\nthings up, maybe the Swami would not have been emotionally upset enough\nto generate the psi force which had activated these new cylinders.\n\nWhat was I saying? That psi was linked with emotional upheaval? Well,\nmaybe. Not necessarily, but Rhine had proved that strength of desire had\nan effect upon the frequency index of telekinesis. Was there anything at\nall we knew about psi, so that we could start cataloguing, sketching in\nthe beginnings of a pattern? Yes, of course there was.\n\nFirst, it existed. No one could dismiss the mountainous mass of evidence\nunless he just refused to think about the subject.\n\nSecond, we could, in time, know what it was and how it worked. You'd\nhave to give up the entire basis of scientific attitude if you didn't\nadmit that.\n\nThird, it acted like a sense, rather than as something dependent upon\nthe intellectual process of thought. You could, for example--I argued to\nmy imaginary listener--command your nose to smell a rose, and by\nautosuggestion you might think you were succeeding; that is, until you\nreally did smell a real rose, then you'd know that you'd failed to\ncreate it through a thought pattern. The sense would have to be\nseparated from the process of thinking about the sense.\n\nSo what was psi? But, at this point, did it matter much? Wasn't the main\nissue one of learning how to produce it, use it? How long did we work\nwith electricity and get a lot of benefits from it before we formed some\ntheories about what it was? And, for that matter, did we know what it\nwas, even yet? \"A flow of electrons\" was a pretty meaningless phrase,\nwhen you stopped to think about it. I could say psi was a flow of\npositrons, and it would mean as much.\n\nI reached over and picked up a cigarette. I started fumbling around in\nthe center drawer of my desk for a matchbook. I didn't find any. Without\nthinking, I opened the drawer containing the two cylinders. They were\npressing up against the side of the desk drawer, still trying to get out\nof the room. Single purposed little beasts, weren't they?\n\nI closed the drawer, and noticed that I was crushing out my cigarette in\nthe ash tray, just as if I'd smoked it. It was the first overt\nindication I'd had that maybe my nerves weren't all they should be this\nmorning.\n\nThe sight of the cylinders brought up the fourth point. Experimental\npsychology was filled with examples of the known senses being unable to\nmake correct evaluations when confronted with a totally new object,\ncolor, scent, taste, sound, impression. It was necessary to have a point\nof orientation before the new could be fitted into the old. What we\nreally lacked in psi was the ability to orient its phenomena. The\nvarious psi gifted individuals tried to do this. If they believed in\nguides from beyond the veil, that's the way they expressed themselves.\nOn the other hand, a Rhine card caller might not be able to give you a\nmessage from your dear departed Aunt Minnie if his life depended upon\nit--yet it could easily be the same force working in both instances.\nConsequently, a medium, such as the Swami, whose basic belief was There\nAre Mysteries, would be unable to function in a framework where the\nobvious intent was to unveil those mysteries!\n\nThat brought up a couple more points. I felt pretty sure of them. I\nfelt as if I were really getting somewhere. And I had a situation which\nwas ideal for proving my points.\n\nI flipped the intercom key, and spoke to Sara.\n\n\"Will you arrange with her foreman for Annie Malasek to come to my\noffice right now?\" I asked. Sara is flippant when things are going along\nall right, but she knows when to buckle down and do what she's asked.\nShe gave me no personal reactions to this request.\n\nYes, Annie Malasek would be a good one. If anybody in the plant believed\nThere Are Mysteries, it would be Annie. Further, she was exaggeratedly\nloyal to me. She believed I was responsible for turning her little\nJennie, the little girl who'd started all this poltergeist trouble, into\na Good Little Girl. In this instance, I had no qualms about taking\nadvantage of that loyalty.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhile I waited for her I called the lieutenant at his hotel. He was in.\nYes, the Swami was also in. They'd just returned. Yes, the Swami was\nranting and raving about leaving Los Angeles at once. He had said he\nabsolutely would have nothing more to do with us here at Computer\nResearch. I told Lieutenant Murphy to scare him with tales of the\nsecret, underground working of Army Intelligence, to quiet him down. And\nI scared the lieutenant a little by pointing out that holding a civilian\nagainst his will without the proper writ was tantamount to kidnapping.\nSo if the Army didn't want trouble with the Civil Courts, all brought\nabout because the lieutenant didn't know how to handle his man--\n\nThe lieutenant became immediately anxious to co\u00f6perate with me. So then\nI soothed him. I told him that, naturally, the Swami was unhappy. He was\nused to Swami-ing, and out here he had been stifled, frustrated. What he\nneeded was some credulous women to catch their breath at his\nawe-inspiring insight and gaze with fearful rapture into his eyes. The\nlieutenant didn't know where he could find any women like that. I told\nhim, dryly, that I would furnish some.\n\nAnnie was more than co\u00f6perative. Sure, the whole plant was buzzing about\nthat foreign-looking Swami who had been seen coming in and out of my\noffice. Sure, a lot of the Girls believed in seances.\n\n\"Why? Don't you, Mr. Kennedy?\" she asked curiously.\n\nI said I wasn't sure, and she clucked her tongue in sympathy. It must be\nterrible not to be sure, so ... well, it must be just terrible. And I\nwas such a kind man, too. I didn't quite get the connection, until I\nremembered there are some patterns which believe a human being would be\nincapable of being kind unless through hope of reward or fear of\npunishment.\n\nBut when I asked her to go to the hotel and persuade the Swami to give\nher a reading, she was reluctant. I thought my plan was going to be\nfrustrated, but it turned out that her reluctance was only because she\ndid not have a thing to wear, going into a high-toned place like that.\n\nSara wasn't the right size, but one of the older girls in the outer\noffice would lend Annie some clothes if I would let her go see the\nSwami, too. It developed that her own teacher was a guest of Los Angeles\nCounty for a while, purely on a trumped-up charge, you understand, Mr.\nKennedy. Not that she was a cop hater or anything like that. She was\nperfectly aware of what a fine and splendid job those noble boys in blue\ndid for us all, but--\n\nIn my own office! Well, you never knew.\n\nYet, what was the difference between her and me? We were both trying to\nget hold of and benefit by psi effects, weren't we? So I didn't comment.\nInstead, I found myself much farther ahead with my tentative plans than\nI'd anticipated at this stage.\n\nYes, my interviewer's teacher had quite a large following, and now they\nwere all at loose ends. If the Swami were willing, she could provide a\nlarge and ready-made audience for him. She would be glad to talk to him\nabout it.\n\nAnnie hurriedly said that she would be glad to talk to him about it,\ntoo; that she could get up a large audience, too. So, even before it got\nstarted, I had my rival factions at work. I egged them both on, and\npromised that I'd get Army Intelligence to work with the local boys in\nblue to hold off making any raids.\n\nAnnie told me again what a kind man I was. My interviewer spoke up\nquickly and said how glad she was to find an opportunity for expressing\nhow grateful she was for the privilege of working right in the same\ndepartment with such an understanding, really intellectually developed\nadult. She eyed Annie sidelong, as if to gauge the effects of her\nattempts to set me up on a pedestal, out of Annie's reach.\n\nI hoped I wouldn't start believing either one of them. I hoped I wasn't\nas inaccurate in my estimates of people as was my interviewer. I\nwondered if she were really qualified for the job she held. Then I\nrealized this was a contest between two women and I, a mere male, was\nsimply being used as the pawn. Well, that worked both ways. In a fair\nbargain both sides receive satisfaction. I felt a little easier about my\ntactical maneuvers.\n\nBut the development of rivalry between factions of the audience gave me\nan additional idea. Perhaps that's what the Swami really needed, a\nlittle rivalry. Perhaps he was being a little too hard to crack because\nhe knew he was the only egg in the basket.\n\nI called Old Stone Face and told him what I planned. He responded that\nit was up to me. He'd stepped in and got things under way for me, got\nthings going, now it was my job to keep them going. It looked as if he\nwere edging out from under--or maybe he really believed that.\n\nBefore I settled into the day's regular routine, I wired General\nSanfordwaithe, and told him that if he had any more prospects ready\nwould he please ship me one at once, via air mail, special delivery.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe recital hall, hired for the Swami's Los Angeles debut, was large\nenough to accommodate all the family friends and relatives of any little\nMaribel who, having mastered \"Daffodils In May,\" for four fingers, was\nbeing given to the World. It had the usual small stage equipped with\npull-back curtains to give a dramatic flourish, or to shut off from view\nthe effects of any sudden nervous catastrophe brought about by stage\nfright.\n\nI got there, purposely a little late, in hopes the house lights would\nalready be dimmed and everything in progress; but about a hundred and\nfifty people were milling around outside on the walk and in the\ncorridors. Both factions had really been busy.\n\nMost of them were women, but, to my intense relief, there were a few\nmen. Some of these were only husbands, but a few of the men wore a look\nwhich said they'd been far away for a long time. Somehow I got the\nimpression that instead of looking into a crystal ball, they would be\nmore inclined to look out of one.\n\nIt was a little disconcerting to realize that no one noticed me, or\nseemed to think I was any different from anybody else. I supposed I\nshould be thankful that I wasn't attracting any attention. I saw my\ninterviewer amid a group of Older Girls. She winked at me roguishly, and\npatted her heavy handbag significantly. As per instructions, she was\ncarrying a couple of the Auerbach cylinders.\n\nI found myself staring in perplexity for a full minute at another woman,\nbefore I realized it was Annie. I had never seen her before, except\ndressed in factory blue jeans, man's blue shirt, and a bandanna wrapped\naround her head. Her companion, probably another of the factory\nassemblers, nudged her and pointed, not too subtly, in my direction.\nAnnie saw me then, and lit up with a big smile. She started toward me,\nhesitated when I frowned and shook my head, flushed with the thought\nthat I didn't want to speak to her in public; then got a flash of better\nsense than that. She, too, gave me a conspiratorial wink and patted her\nhandbag.\n\nMy confederates were doing nicely.\n\nAlmost immediately thereafter a horse-faced, mustached old gal started\nrounding people up in a honey sweet, pear shaped voice; and herded them\ninto the auditorium. I chose one of the wooden folding chairs in the\nback row.\n\nA heavy jowled old gal came out in front of the closed curtains and gave\na little introductory talk about how lucky we all were that the Swami\nhad consented to visit with us. There was the usual warning to anyone\nwho was not of the esoteric that we must not expect too much, that\nsometimes nothing at all happened, that true believers did not attend\njust to see effects. She reminded us kittenishly that the guides were\ncapricious, and that we must all help by merging ourselves in the great\nflowing currents of absolute infinity.\n\nShe finally faltered, realized she was probably saying all the things\nthe Swami would want to say--in the manner of people who introduce\nspeakers everywhere--and with a girlish little flourish she waved at\nsomeone off stage.\n\nThe house lights dimmed. The curtains swirled up and back.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Swami was doing all right for himself. He was seated behind a small\ntable in the center of the stage. A pale violet light diffused through a\nhuge crystal ball on the table, and threw his dark features into sharp\nrelief. It gave an astonishingly remote and inscrutable wisdom to his\nfeatures. In the pale light, and at this distance, his turban looked\nquite clean.\n\nHe began to speak slowly and sonorously. A hush settled over the\naudience, and gradually I felt myself merging with the mass reaction of\nthe rest. As I listened, I got the feeling that what he was saying was\nof tremendous importance, that somehow his words contained great and\nrevealing wonders--or would contain them if I were only sufficiently\nadvanced to comprehend their true meanings. The man was good, he knew\nhis trade. All men search for truth at one level or another. I began to\nrealize why such a proportionate few choose the cold and impersonal\nlaboratory. Perhaps if there were a way to put science to music--\n\nThe Swami talked on for about twenty minutes, and then I noticed his\nvoice had grown deeper and deeper in tone, and suddenly, without any\napparent transition, we all knew it was not really the Swami's voice we\nwere hearing. And then he began to tell members of the audience little\nintimate things about themselves, things which only they should know.\n\nHe was good at this, too. He had mastered the trick of making universals\nsound like specifics. I could do the same thing. The patterns of\npeople's lives have multiple similarities. To a far greater extent than\ngenerally realized the same things happen to everyone. The idea was to\ntake some of the lesser known ones and word them so they seemed to apply\nto one isolated individual.\n\nFor instance, I could tell a fellow about when he was a little boy there\nwas a little girl in a red dress with blond pigtails who used to scrap\nwith him and tattle things about him to her mother. If he were inclined\nto be credulous, this was second sight I had. But it is a universal.\nWhat average boy didn't, at one time or another, know a little girl with\nblond pigtails? What blond little girl didn't occasionally wear a red\ndress? What little girl didn't tattle to her mother about the naughty\nthings the boys were doing?\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe Swami did that for a while. The audience was leaning forward in a\nrapture of ecstasy. First the organ tones of his voice soothed and\nsoftened. The phrases which should mean something if only you had the\ncomprehension. The universals applied as specifics. He had his audience\nin the palm of his hand. He didn't need his crystal ball to tell him\nthat.\n\nBut he wanted it to be complete. Most of the responses had been from\nwomen. He gave them the generalities which didn't sound like\ngeneralities. They confirmed with specifics. But most were women. He\nwanted the men, too. He began to concentrate on the men. He made it\neasy.\n\n\"I have a message,\" he said. \"From ... now let me get it right ... from\nR. S. It is for a man in this audience. Will the man who knew R. S.\nacknowledge?\"\n\nThere was a silence. And that was such an easy one, too. I hadn't\nplanned to participate, but, on impulse, since none of the other men\nwere cooperating, I spoke up.\n\n\"Robert Smith!\" I exclaimed. \"Good old Bob!\"\n\nSeveral of the women sitting near me looked at me and beamed their\napproval. One of the husbands scowled at me.\n\n\"I can tell by your tone,\" the Swami said, and apparently he hadn't\nrecognized my tone, \"that you have forgiven him. That is the message. He\nwants you to know that he is happy. He is much wiser now. He knows now\nthat he was wrong.\"\n\nOne of the women reached over and patted me on the shoulder, giving me\nmotherly encouragement.\n\nBut the Swami had no more messages for men. He was smart enough to know\nwhere to stop. He'd tried one of the simplest come-ons, and there had\nbeen too much of a pause. It had almost not come off.\n\nI wondered who good old Bob Smith was? Surely, among the thousands of\napplicants I'd interviewed, there must have been a number of them. And,\nbeing applicants, of course some of them had been wrong.\n\nThe Swami's tones, giving one message after another--faster and faster\nnow, not waiting for acknowledgment or confirmation--began to sink into\na whisper. His speech became ragged, heavy. The words became\nindistinguishable. About his head there began to float a pale,\nluminescent sphere. There was a subdued gasp from the audience and then\ncomplete stillness. As though, unbreathing, in the depths of a tomb,\nthey watched the sphere. It bobbed about, over the Swami's head and\naround him. At times it seemed as if about to float off stage, but it\ncame back. It swirled out over the audience, but not too far, and never\nat such an angle that the long, flexible dull black wire supporting it\nwould be silhouetted against the glowing crystal ball.\n\nThen it happened. There was a gasp, a smothered scream. And over at one\nside of the auditorium a dark object began bobbing about in the air up\nnear the ceiling. It swerved and swooped. The Swami's luminescent sphere\njerked to a sudden stop. The Swami sat with open mouth and stared at the\ndark object which he was not controlling.\n\nThe dark object was not confined to any dull black wire. It went where\nit willed. It went too high and brushed against the ceiling.\n\nThere was a sudden shower of coins to the floor. A compact hit the floor\nwith a flat spat. A handkerchief floated down more slowly.\n\n\"My purse!\" a woman gasped. I recognized my interviewer's voice. Her\npurse contained two Auerbach cylinders, and they were having themselves\na ball.\n\nIn alarm, I looked quickly at the stage, hoping the Swami wasn't astute\nenough to catch on. But he was gone. The audience, watching the bobbing\npurse, hadn't realized it as yet. And they were delayed in realizing it\nby a diversion from the other side of the auditorium.\n\n\"I can't hold it down any longer, Mr. Kennedy!\" a woman gasped out.\n\"It's taking me up into the air!\"\n\n\"Hold on, Annie!\" I shouted back. \"I'm coming!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA chastened and subdued Swami sat in my office the following morning,\nand this time he was inclined to be co\u00f6perative. More, he was looking to\nme for guidance, understanding, and didn't mind acknowledging my\nascendancy. And, with the lieutenant left in the outer office, he didn't\nhave any face to preserve.\n\nLater, last night, he'd learned the truth of what happened after he had\nrun away in a panic. I'd left a call at the hotel for the lieutenant.\nWhen the lieutenant had got him calmed down and returned my call, I'd\ninstructed the lieutenant to tell the Swami about the Auerbach\ncylinders; to tell the Swami he was not a fake after all.\n\nThe Swami had obviously spent a sleepless night. It is a terrible thing\nto have spent years perfecting the art of fakery, and then to realize\nyou needn't have faked at all. More terrible, he had swallowed some of\nhis own medicine, and was overcome with fear of the forces which he had\nbeen commanding. All through the night he had shivered in fear of some\ninstant and horrible retaliation. For him it was still a case of There\nAre Mysteries.\n\nAnd it was of no comfort to his state of mind right now that the four\ncylinders we had finally captured last night were, at this moment,\nbobbing about in my office, swooping and swerving around in the upper\npart of the room, like bats trying to find some opening. I was giving\nhim the full treatment! The first two cylinders, down on the floor, were\npressing up against my closed door, like frightened little things trying\nto escape a room of horror.\n\nThe Swami's face was twitching, and his long fingers kept twining\nthemselves into King's X symbols. But he was sitting it out. He was\nswallowing some of the hair of the dog that bit him. I had to give him A\nfor that.\n\n\"I've been trying to build up a concept of the framework wherein psi\nseems to function,\" I told him casually, just as if it were all a\nformularized laboratory procedure. \"I had to pull last night's stunt to\nprove something.\"\n\nHe tore his eyes away from the cylinders which were over exploring one\ncorner of the ceiling, and looked at me.\n\n\"Let's go to electricity,\" I said speculatively. \"Not that we know psi\nand electricity have anything in common, other than some similar\nanalogies, but we don't know they don't. Both of them may be just\ndifferent manifestations of the same thing. We don't really know why a\nmagnetized core, turning inside a coil of copper wire, generates\nelectricity.\n\n\"Oh we've got some phrases,\" I acknowledged. \"We've got a whole\nstructure of phrases, and when you listen to them they sound as if they\nought to mean something--like the phrases you were using last night.\nEverybody assumes they do mean something to the pundits. So, since it is\nhuman to want to be a pundit, we repeat these phrases over and over, and\ncall them explanations. Yet we do know what happens, even if we do just\ntheorize about why. We know how to wrap something around something and\nget electricity.\n\n\"Take the induction coil,\" I said. \"We feed a low-voltage current into\none end, and we draw off a high-voltage current from the other. But\nanyone who wants, any time, can disprove the whole principle of the\ninduction coil. All you have to do is wrap your core with a\nnonconductor, say nylon thread, and presto, nothing comes out. You see,\nit doesn't work; and anybody who claims it does is a faker and a liar.\nThat's what happens when science tries to investigate psi by the\nstandard methods.\n\n\"You surround a psi-gifted individual with nonbelievers, and probably\nnothing will come out of it. Surround him with true believers; and it\nall seems to act like an induction coil. Things happen. Yet even when\nthings do happen, it is usually impossible to prove it.\n\n\"Take yourself, Swami. And this is significant. First we have the north\npoint effect. Then those two little beggars trying to get out the door.\nThen the ones which are bobbing around up there. Without the cylinders\nthere would have been no way to know that anything had happened at all.\n\n\"Now, about this psi framework. It isn't something you can turn on and\noff, at will. We don't know enough yet for that. Aside from some\nbelievers and those individuals who do seem to attract psi forces, we\ndon't know, yet, what to wrap around what. So, here's what you're to do:\nYou're to keep a supply of these cylinders near you at all times. If any\npsi effects happen, they'll record it. Fair enough?\n\n\"Now,\" I said with finality. \"I have anticipated that you might refuse.\nBut you're not the only person who has psi ability. I've wired General\nSanfordwaithe to send me another fellow; one who will co\u00f6perate.\"\n\nThe Swami thought it over. Here he was with a suite in a good hotel;\nwith an army lieutenant to look after his earthly needs; on the payroll\nof a respectable company; with a ready-made flock of believers; and no\nfear of the bunco squad. He had never had it so good. The side money,\nfor private readings alone, should be substantial.\n\nFurther, and he watched me narrowly, I didn't seem to be afraid of the\ncylinders. It was probably this which gave the clincher.\n\n\"I'll co\u00f6perate,\" he agreed meekly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor three days there was nothing. The Swami seemed co\u00f6perative enough.\nHe called me a couple times a day and reported that the cylinders just\nlay around his room. I didn't know what to tell him. I recommended he\nread biographies of famous mediums. I recommended fasting, and\nbreathing, and contemplating self. He seemed dubious, but said he'd try\nit.\n\nOn the morning of the third day, Sara called me on the intercom and told\nme there was another Army lieutenant in her office, and another charac\n... another gentleman. I opened my door and went out to Sara's office to\ngreet them. My first glimpse told me Sara had been right the first time.\nHe was a character.\n\nThe new lieutenant was no more than the standard output from the same\nproduction line as Lieutenant Murphy, but the wizened little old man he\nhad in tow was from a different and much rarer matrix. As fast as I had\nmoved, I was none too soon. The character reached over and tilted up\nSara's chin as I was coming through the door.\n\n\"Now you're a healthy young wench,\" he said with a leer. \"What are you\ndoing tonight, baby?\" The guy was at least eighty years old.\n\n\"Hey, you, pop!\" I exclaimed in anger. \"Be your age!\"\n\nHe turned around and looked me up and down.\n\n\"I'm younger, that way, than you are, right now!\" he snapped.\n\nA disturbance in the outer office kept me from thinking up a retort.\nThere were some subdued screams, some scuffling of heavy shoes, the\nsounds of some running feet as applicants got away. The outer door to\nSara's office was flung open.\n\nFramed in the doorway, breast high, floated the Swami!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was sitting, cross-legged, on a hotel bathmat. From both front\ncorners, where they had been attached by loops of twine, there peeked\nAuerbach cylinders. Two more rear cylinders were grasped in Lieutenant\nMurphy's strong hands. He was propelling the Swami along, mid air, in\nAtlantic City Boardwalk style.\n\nThe Swami looked down at us with aloof disdain, then his eyes focused on\nthe old man. His glance wavered; he threw a startled and fearful look at\nthe cylinders holding up his bathmat. They did not fall. A vast relief\noverspread his face, and he drew himself erect with more disdain than\never. The old man was not so aloof.\n\n\"Harry Glotz!\" he exclaimed. \"Why you ... you faker! What are you doing\nin that getup?\"\n\nThe Swami took a casual turn about the room, leaning to one side on his\nmagic carpet as if banking an airplane.\n\n\"Peasant!\" He spat the word out and motioned grandly toward the door.\nLieutenant Murphy pushed him through.\n\n\"Why, that no good bum!\" the old man shouted at me. \"That no-good from\nnowhere! I'll fix him! Thinks he's something, does he? I'll show him!\nAnything he can do I can do better!\"\n\nHis rage got the better of him. He rushed through the door, shaking both\nfists above his white head, shouting imprecations, threats, and pleading\nto be shown how the trick was done, all in the same breath. The new\nlieutenant cast a stricken look at us and then sped after his charge.\n\n\"Looks as if we're finally in production,\" I said to Sara.\n\n\"That's only the second one,\" she said mournfully. \"When you get all six\nof them, this joint's sure going to be jumping!\"\n\nI looked out of her window at the steel and concrete walls of the\nfactory. They were solid, real, secure; they were a symbol of reality,\nthe old reality a man could understand.\n\n\"I hope you don't mean that literally, Sara,\" I answered dubiously.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThis etext was produced from _Astounding Science Fiction_ March 1955.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright\non this publication was renewed.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
