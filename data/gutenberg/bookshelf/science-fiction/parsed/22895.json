I undervalue my own achievements,\nand thereby permit petty imitators like Corveille to influence the\ncommittee and win the Morell prize.\"\n\n\"But,\" I said soothingly, \"you've won the Morell physics award half a\ndozen times, professor. They can't very well give it to you every year.\"\n\n\"Why not, since it is plain that I deserve it?\" bristled the professor.\n\"Understand, Dixon, that I do not regret my modesty, even though it\npermits conceited fools like Corveille, who have infinitely less reason\nthan I for conceit, to win awards that mean nothing save prizes for\nsuccessful bragging. Bah! To grant an award for research along such\nobvious lines that I neglected to mention them, thinking that even a\nMorell judge would appreciate their obviousness! Research on the\npsychon, eh! Who discovered the psychon? Who but van Manderpootz?\"\n\n\"Wasn't that what you got last year's award for?\" I asked consolingly.\n\"And after all, isn't this modesty, this lack of jealousy on your part,\na symbol of greatness of character?\"\n\n\"True--true!\" said the great van Manderpootz, mollified. \"Had such an\naffront been committed against a lesser man than myself, he would\ndoubtless have entered a bitter complaint against the judges. But not I.\nAnyway, I know from experience that it wouldn't do any good. And\nbesides, despite his greatness, van Manderpootz is as modest and\nshrinking as a violet.\" At this point he paused, and his broad red face\ntried to look violet-like.\n\nI suppressed a smile. I knew the eccentric genius of old, from the days\nwhen I had been Dixon Wells, undergraduate student of engineering, and\nhad taken a course in Newer Physics (that is, in Relativity) under the\nfamous professor. For some unguessable reason, he had taken a fancy to\nme, and as a result, I had been involved in several of his experiments\nsince graduation. There was the affair of the subjunctivisor, for\ninstance, and also that of the idealizator; in the first of these\nepisodes I had suffered the indignity of falling in love with a girl two\nweeks after she was apparently dead, and in the second, the equal or\ngreater indignity of falling in love with a girl who didn't exist, never\nhad existed, and never would exist--in other words, with an ideal.\nPerhaps I'm a little susceptible to feminine charms, or rather, perhaps\nI used to be, for since the disaster of the idealizator, I have grimly\nrelegated such follies to the past, much to the disgust of various\n'vision entertainers, singers, dancers, and the like.\n\nSo of late I had been spending my days very seriously, trying\nwholeheartedly to get to the office on time just once, so that I could\nrefer to it next time my father accused me of never getting anywhere on\ntime. I hadn't succeeded yet, but fortunately the N. J. Wells\nCorporation was wealthy enough to survive even without the full-time\nservices of Dixon Wells, or should I say even _with_ them? Anyway, I'm\nsure my father preferred to have me late in the morning after an evening\nwith van Manderpootz than after one with Tips Alva or Whimsy White, or\none of the numerous others of the ladies of the 'vision screen. Even in\nthe twenty-first century, he retained a lot of old-fashioned ideas.\n\nVan Manderpootz had ceased to remember that he was as modest and\nshrinking as a violet. \"It has just occurred to me,\" he announced\nimpressively, \"that years have character much as humans have. This year,\n2015, will be remembered in history as a very stupid year, in which the\nMorell prize was given to a nincompoop. Last year, on the other hand,\nwas a very intelligent year, a jewel in the crown of civilization. Not\nonly was the Morell prize given to van Manderpootz, but I announced my\ndiscrete field theory in that year, and the University unveiled Gogli's\nstatue of me as well.\" He sighed. \"Yes, a very intelligent year! What do\nyou think?\"\n\n\"It depends on how you look at it,\" I responded glumly. \"I didn't enjoy\nit so much, what with Joanna Caldwell and Denise d'Agrion, and your\ninfernal experiments. It's all in the point of view.\"\n\nThe professor snorted. \"Infernal experiments, eh! Point of view! Of\ncourse it's all in the point of view. Even Einstein's simple little\nsynthesis was enough to prove that. If the whole world could adopt an\nintelligent and admirable point of view--that of van Manderpootz, for\ninstance--all troubles would be over. If it were possible--\" He paused,\nand an expression of amazed wonder spread over his ruddy face.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" I asked.\n\n\"Matter? I am astonished! The astounding depths of genius awe me. I am\noverwhelmed with admiration at the incalculable mysteries of a great\nmind.\"\n\n\"I don't get the drift.\"\n\n\"Dixon,\" he said impressively, \"you have been privileged to look upon an\nexample of the workings of a genius. More than that, you have planted\nthe seed from which perhaps shall grow the towering tree of thought.\nIncredible as it seems, you, Dixon Wells, have given van Manderpootz an\nidea! It is thus that genius seizes upon the small, the unimportant, the\nnegligible, and turns it to its own grand purposes. I stand awe-struck!\"\n\n\"But what--?\"\n\n\"Wait,\" said van Manderpootz, still in rapt admiration of the majesty of\nhis own mind. \"When the tree bears fruit, you shall see it. Until then,\nbe satisfied that you have played a part in its planting.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was perhaps a month before I saw van Manderpootz again, but one\nbright spring evening his broad, rubicund face looked out of the\nphone-screen at me.\n\n\"It's ready,\" he announced impressively.\n\n\"What is?\"\n\nThe professor looked pained at the thought that I could have forgotten.\n\"The tree has borne fruit,\" he explained. \"If you wish to drop over to\nmy quarters, we'll proceed to the laboratory and try it out. I do not\nset a time, so that it will be utterly impossible for you to be late.\"\n\nI ignored that last dig, but had a time been set, I would doubtless\nhave been even later than usual, for it was with some misgivings that I\ninduced myself to go at all. I still remembered the unpleasantness of my\nlast two experiences with the inventions of van Manderpootz. However, at\nlast we were seated in the small laboratory, while out in the larger one\nthe professor's technical assistant, Carter, puttered over some device,\nand in the far corner his secretary, the plain and unattractive Miss\nFitch, transcribed lecture notes, for van Manderpootz abhorred the\nthought that his golden utterances might be lost to posterity. On the\ntable between the professor and myself lay a curious device, something\nthat looked like a cross between a pair of nose-glasses and a miner's\nlamp.\n\n\"There it is,\" said van Manderpootz proudly. \"There lies my\nattitudinizor, which may well become an epoch-making device.\"\n\n\"How? What does it do?\"\n\n\"I will explain. The germ of the idea traces back to that remark of\nyours about everything depending on the point of view. A very obvious\nstatement, of course, but genius seizes on the obvious and draws from it\nthe obscure. Thus the thoughts of even the simplest mind can suggest to\nthe man of genius his sublime conceptions, as is evident from the fact\nthat I got this idea from you.\"\n\n\"What idea?\"\n\n\"Be patient. There is much you must understand first. You must realize\njust how true is the statement that everything depends on the point of\nview. Einstein proved that motion, space, and time depend on the\nparticular point of view of the observer, or as he expressed it, on the\nscale of reference used. I go farther than that, infinitely farther. I\npropound the theory that the observer _is_ the point of view. I go even\nbeyond that, I maintain that the world itself is merely the point of\nview!\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"Look here,\" proceeded van Manderpootz. \"It is obvious that the world I\nsee is entirely different from the one in which you live. It is equally\nobvious that a strictly religious man occupies a different world than\nthat of a materialist. The fortunate man lives in a happy world; the\nunfortunate man sees a world of misery. One man is happy with little,\nanother is miserable with much. Each sees the world from his own point\nof view, which is the same as saying that each lives in his own world.\nTherefore there are as many worlds as there are points of view.\"\n\n\"But,\" I objected, \"that theory is to disregard reality. Out of all the\ndifferent points of view, there must be one that is right, and all the\nrest are wrong.\"\n\n\"One would think so,\" agreed the professor. \"One would think that\nbetween the point of view of you, for instance, as contrasted with that\nof, say van Manderpootz, there would be small doubt as to which was\ncorrect. However, early in the twentieth century, Heisenberg enunciated\nhis Principle of Uncertainty, which proved beyond argument that a\ncompletely accurate scientific picture of the world is quite impossible,\nthat the law of cause and effect is merely a phase of the law of chance,\nthat no infallible predictions can ever be made, and that what science\nused to call natural laws are really only descriptions of the way in\nwhich the human mind perceives nature. In other words, the character of\nthe world depends entirely on the mind observing it, or, to return to my\nearlier statement, the point of view.\"\n\n\"But no one can ever really understand another person's point of view,\"\nI said. \"It isn't fair to undermine the whole basis of science because\nyou can't be sure that the color we both call red wouldn't look green to\nyou if you could see it through my eyes.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said van Manderpootz triumphantly. \"So we come now to my\nattitudinizor. Suppose that it were possible for me to see through your\neyes, or you through mine. Do you see what a boon such an ability would\nbe to humanity? Not only from the standpoint of science, but also\nbecause it would obviate all troubles due to misunderstandings. And even\nmore.\" Shaking his finger, the professor recited oracularly, \"'Oh, wad\nsome pow'r the giftie gie us to see oursel's as ithers see us.' Van\nManderpootz is that power, Dixon. Through my attitudinizor, one may at\nlast adopt the viewpoint of another. The poet's plaint of more than two\ncenturies ago is answered at last.\"\n\n\"How the devil do you see through somebody else's eyes?\"\n\n\"Very simply. You will recall the idealizator. Now it is obvious that\nwhen I peered over your shoulder and perceived in the mirror your\nconception of the ideal woman, I was, to a certain extent, adopting your\npoint of view. In that case the psychons given off by your mind were\nconverted into quanta of visible light, which could be seen. In the\ncase of my attitudinizor, the process is exactly reversed. One flashes\nthe beam of this light on the subject whose point of view is desired;\nthe visible light is reflected back with a certain accompaniment of\npsychons, which are here intensified to a degree which will permit them\nto be, so to speak, appreciated?\"\n\n\"Psychons?\"\n\n\"Have you already forgotten my discovery of the unit particle of\nthought? Must I explain again how the cosmons, chronons, spations,\npsychons, and all other particles are interchangeable? And that,\" he\ncontinued abstractedly, \"leads to certain interesting speculations.\nSuppose I were to convert, say, a ton of material protons and electrons\ninto spations--that is, convert matter into space. I calculate that a\nton of matter will produce approximately a cubic mile of space. Now the\nquestion is, where would we put it, since all the space we have is\nalready occupied by space? Or if I manufactured an hour or two of time?\nIt is obvious that we have no time to fit in an extra couple of hours,\nsince all our time is already accounted for. Doubtless it will take a\ncertain amount of thought for even van Manderpootz to solve these\nproblems, but at the moment I am curious to watch the workings of the\nattitudinizor. Suppose you put it on, Dixon.\"\n\n\"I? Haven't _you_ tried it out yet?\"\n\n\"Of course not. In the first place, what has van Manderpootz to gain by\nstudying the viewpoints of other people? The object of the device is to\npermit people to study nobler viewpoints than their own. And in the\nsecond place, I have asked myself whether it is fair to the world for\nvan Manderpootz to be the first to try out a new and possibly\nuntrustworthy device, and I reply, 'No!'\"\n\n\"But _I_ should try it out, eh? Well, everytime I try out any of your\ninventions I find myself in some kind of trouble. I'd be a fool to go\naround looking for more difficulty, wouldn't I?\"\n\n\"I assure you that _my_ viewpoint will be much less apt to get you into\ntrouble than your own,\" said van Manderpootz with dignity. \"There will\nbe no question of your becoming involved in some impossible love affair\nas long as you stick to that.\"\n\nNevertheless, despite the assurance of the great scientist, I was more\nthan a little reluctant to don the device. Yet I was curious, as well;\nit seemed a fascinating prospect to be able to look at the world through\nother eyes, as fascinating as visiting a new world--which it was,\naccording to the professor. So after a few moments of hesitation, I\npicked up the instrument, slipped it over my head so that the eyeglasses\nwere in the proper position, and looked inquiringly at van Manderpootz.\n\n\"You must turn it on,\" he said, reaching over and clicking a switch on\nthe frame. \"Now flash the light to my face. That's the way; just center\nthe circle of light on my face. And now what do you see?\"\n\nI didn't answer; what I saw was, for the moment, quite indescribable. I\nwas completely dazed and bewildered, and it was only when some\ninvoluntary movement of my head at last flashed the light from the\nprofessor's face to the table top that a measure of sanity returned,\nwhich proves at least that tables do not possess any point of view.\n\n\"O-o-o-h!\" I gasped.\n\nVan Manderpootz beamed. \"Of course you are overwhelmed. One could hardly\nexpect to adopt the view of van Manderpootz without some difficulties of\nadjustment. A second time will be easier.\"\n\nI reached up and switched off the light. \"A second time will not only be\neasier, but also impossible,\" I said crossly. \"I'm not going to\nexperience another dizzy spell like that for anybody.\"\n\n\"But of course you will, Dixon. I am certain that the dizziness will be\nnegligible on the second trial. Naturally the unexpected heights\naffected you, much as if you were to come without warning to the brink\nof a colossal precipice. But this time you will be prepared, and the\neffect will be much less.\"\n\nWell, it was. After a few moments I was able to give my full attention\nto the phenomena of the attitudinizor, and queer phenomena they were,\ntoo. I scarcely know how to describe the sensation of looking at the\nworld through the filter of another's mind. It is almost an\nindescribable experience, but so, in the ultimate analysis, is any other\nexperience.\n\nWhat I saw first was a kaleidoscopic array of colors and shapes, but the\namazing, astounding, inconceivable thing about the scene was that there\nwas no single color I could recognize! The eyes of van Manderpootz, or\nperhaps his brain, interpreted color in a fashion utterly alien to the\nway in which my own functioned, and the resultant spectrum was so\nbizarre that there is simply no way of describing any single tint in\nwords. To say, as I did to the professor, that his conception of red\nlooked to me like a shade between purple and green conveys absolutely no\nmeaning, and the only way a third person could appreciate the meaning\nwould be to examine my point of view through an attitudinizor _while_ I\nwas examining that of van Manderpootz. Thus he could apprehend my\nconception of van Manderpootz's reaction to the color red.\n\nAnd shapes! It took me several minutes to identify the weird, angular,\ntwisted, distorted appearance in the center of the room as the plain\nlaboratory table. The room itself, aside from its queer form, looked\nsmaller, perhaps because van Manderpootz is somewhat larger than I.\n\nBut by far the strangest part of his point of view had nothing to do\nwith the outlook upon the physical world, but with the more fundamental\nelements--with his _attitudes_. Most of his thoughts, on that first\noccasion, were beyond me, because I had not yet learned to interpret the\npersonal symbolism in which he thought. But I did understand his\nattitudes. There was Carter, for instance, toiling away out in the large\nlaboratory; I saw at once what a plodding, unintelligent drudge he\nseemed to van Manderpootz. And there was Miss Fitch; I confess that she\nhad always seemed unattractive to me, but my impression of her was Venus\nherself beside that of the professor! She hardly seemed human to him and\nI am sure that he never thought of her as a woman, but merely as a piece\nof convenient but unimportant laboratory equipment.\n\nAt this point I caught a glimpse of myself through the eyes of van\nManderpootz. Ouch! Perhaps I'm not a genius, but I'm dead certain that\nI'm not the grinning ape I appeared to be in his eyes. And perhaps I'm\nnot exactly the handsomest man in the world either, but if I thought I\nlooked like that--! And then, to cap the climax, I apprehended van\nManderpootz's conception of himself!\n\n\"That's enough!\" I yelled. \"I won't stay around here just to be\ninsulted. I'm through!\"\n\nI tore the attitudinizor from my head and tossed it to the table,\nfeeling suddenly a little foolish at the sight of the grin on the face\nof the professor.\n\n\"That is hardly the spirit which has led science to its great\nachievements, Dixon,\" he observed amiably. \"Suppose you describe the\nnature of the insults, and if possible, something about the workings of\nthe attitudinizor as well. After all, that is what you were supposed to\nbe observing.\"\n\nI flushed, grumbled a little, and complied. Van Manderpootz listened\nwith great interest to my description of the difference in our physical\nworlds, especially the variations in our perceptions of form and color.\n\n\"What a field for an artist!\" he ejaculated at last. \"Unfortunately, it\nis a field that must remain forever untapped, because even though an\nartist examined a thousand viewpoints and learned innumerable new\ncolors, his pigments would continue to impress his audience with the\nsame old colors each of them had always known.\" He sighed thoughtfully,\nand then proceeded. \"However, the device is apparently quite safe to\nuse. I shall therefore try it briefly, bringing to the investigation a\ncalm, scientific mind which refuses to be troubled by the trifles that\nseem to bother you.\"\n\nHe donned the attitudinizor, and I must confess that he stood the shock\nof the first trial somewhat better than I did. After a surprised \"Oof!\"\nhe settled down to a complacent analysis of my point of view, while I\nsat somewhat self-consciously under his calm appraisal. Calm, that is,\nfor about three minutes.\n\nSuddenly he leaped to his feet, tearing the device from a face whose\nnormal ruddiness had deepened to a choleric angry color. \"Get out!\" he\nroared. \"So _that's_ the way van Manderpootz looks to you! Moron! Idiot!\nImbecile! Get out!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a week or ten days later that I happened to be passing the\nUniversity on my way from somewhere to somewhere else, and I fell to\nwondering whether the professor had yet forgiven me. There was a light\nin the window of his laboratory over in the Physics Building, so I\ndropped in, making my way past the desk where Carter labored, and the\ncorner where Miss Fitch sat in dull primness at her endless task of\ntranscribing lecture notes.\n\nVan Manderpootz greeted me cordially enough, but with a curious\nassumption of melancholy in his manner. \"Ah, Dixon,\" he began, \"I am\nglad to see you. Since our last meeting, I have learned much of the\nstupidity of the world, and it appears to me now that you are actually\none of the more intelligent contemporary minds.\"\n\nThis from van Manderpootz! \"Why--thank you,\" I said.\n\n\"It is true. For some days I have sat at the window overlooking the\nstreet there, and have observed the viewpoints of the passers-by. Would\nyou believe\"--his voice lowered--\"would you believe that only seven and\nfour-tenths percent are even aware of the _existence_ of van\nManderpootz? And doubtless many of the few that are, come from among the\nstudents in the neighborhood. I knew that the average level of\nintelligence was low, but it had not occurred to me that it was as low\nas that.\"\n\n\"After all,\" I said consolingly, \"you must remember that the\nachievements of van Manderpootz are such as to attract the attention of\nthe intelligent few rather than of the many.\"\n\n\"A very silly paradox!\" he snapped. \"On the basis of that theory, since\nthe higher one goes in the scale of intelligence, the fewer individuals\none finds, the greatest achievement of all is one that _nobody_ has\nheard of. By that test you would be greater than van Manderpootz, an\nobvious _reductio ad absurdum_.\"\n\nHe glared his reproof that I should even have thought of the point, then\nsomething in the outer laboratory caught his ever-observant eye.\n\n\"Carter!\" he roared. \"Is that a synobasical interphasometer in the\npositronic flow? Fool! What sort of measurements do you expect to make\nwhen your measuring instrument itself is part of the experiment? Take it\nout and start over!\"\n\nHe rushed away toward the unfortunate technician. I settled idly back in\nmy chair and stared about the small laboratory, whose walls had seen so\nmany marvels. The latest, the attitudinizor, lay carelessly on the\ntable, dropped there by the professor after his analysis of the mass\nviewpoint of the pedestrians in the street below.\n\nI picked up the device and fell to examining its construction. Of course\nthis was utterly beyond me, for no ordinary engineer can hope to grasp\nthe intricacies of a van Manderpootz concept. So, after a puzzled but\nadmiring survey of its infinitely delicate wires and grids and lenses, I\nmade the obvious move. I put it on.\n\nMy first thought was the street, but since the evening was well along,\nthe walk below the window was deserted. Back in my chair again, I sat\nmusing idly when a faint sound that was not the rumbling of the\nprofessor's voice attracted my attention. I identified it shortly as the\nbuzzing of a heavy fly, butting its head stupidly against the pane of\nglass that separated the small laboratory from the large room beyond. I\nwondered casually what the viewpoint of a fly was like, and ended by\nflashing the light on the creature.\n\nFor some moments I saw nothing other than I had been seeing right along\nfrom my own personal point of view, because, as van Manderpootz\nexplained later, the psychons from the miserable brain of a fly are too\nfew to produce any but the vaguest of impressions. But gradually I\nbecame aware of a picture, a queer and indescribable scene.\n\nFlies are color-blind. That was my first impression, for the world was a\ndull panorama of greys and whites and blacks. Flies are extremely\nnearsighted; when I had finally identified the scene as the interior of\nthe familiar room, I discovered that it seemed enormous to the insect,\nwhose vision did not extend more than six feet, though it did take in\nalmost a complete sphere, so that the creature could see practically in\nall directions at once. But perhaps the most astonishing thing, though I\ndid not think of it until later, was that the compound eye of the\ninsect, did not convey to it the impression of a vast number of separate\npictures, such as the eye produces when a microphotograph is taken\nthrough it. The fly sees one picture just as we do; in the same way as\nour brain rights the upside-down image cast on our retina, the fly's\nbrain reduces the compound image to one. And beyond these impressions\nwere a wild hodge-podge of smell-sensations, and a strange desire to\nburst through the invisible glass barrier into the brighter light\nbeyond. But I had no time to analyze these sensations, for suddenly\nthere was a flash of something infinitely clearer than the dim\ncerebrations of a fly.\n\nFor half a minute or longer I was unable to guess what that momentary\nflash had been. I knew that I had seen something incredibly lovely, that\nI had tapped a viewpoint that looked upon something whose very presence\ncaused ecstasy, but whose viewpoint it was, or what that flicker of\nbeauty had been, were questions beyond my ability to answer.\n\nI slipped off the attitudinizor and sat staring perplexedly at the\nbuzzing fly on the pane of glass. Out in the other room van Manderpootz\ncontinued his harangue to the repentant Carter, and off in a corner\ninvisible from my position I could hear the rustle of papers as Miss\nFitch transcribed endless notes. I puzzled vainly over the problem of\nwhat had happened, and then the solution dawned on me.\n\nThe fly must have buzzed between me and one of the occupants of the\nouter laboratory. I had been following its flight with the faintly\nvisible beam of the attitudinizor's light, and that beam must have\nflickered momentarily on the head of one of the three beyond the glass.\nBut which? Van Manderpootz himself? It must have been either the\nprofessor or Carter, since the secretary was quite beyond range of the\nlight.\n\nIt seemed improbable that the cold and brilliant mind of van Manderpootz\ncould be the agency of the sort of emotional ecstasy I had sensed. It\nmust therefore, have been the head of the mild and inoffensive little\nCarter that the beam had tapped. With a feeling of curiosity I slipped\nthe device back on my own head and sent the beam sweeping dimly into the\nlarger room.\n\nIt did not at the time occur to me that such a procedure was quite as\ndiscreditable as eavesdropping, or even more dishonorable, if you come\nright down to it, because it meant the theft of far more personal\ninformation than one could ever convey by the spoken word. But all I\nconsidered at the moment was my own curiosity; I wanted to learn what\nsort of viewpoint could produce that strange, instantaneous flash of\nbeauty. If the proceeding was unethical--well, Heaven knows I was\npunished for it.\n\nSo I turned the attitudinizor on Carter. At the moment, he was listening\nrespectfully to van Manderpootz, and I sensed clearly his respect for\nthe great man, a respect that had in it a distinct element of fear. I\ncould hear Carter's impression of the booming voice of the professor,\nsounding somewhat like the modulated thunder of a god, which was not far\nfrom the little man's actual opinion of his master. I perceived Carter's\nopinion of himself, and his self-picture was an even more mouselike\nportrayal than my own impression of him. When, for an instant, he\nglanced my way, I sensed his impression of me, and while I'm sure that\nDixon Wells is not the imbecile he appears to van Manderpootz, I'm\nequally sure that he's not the debonair man of the world he seemed to\nCarter. All in all, Carter's point of view seemed that of a timid,\ninoffensive, retiring, servile little man, and I wondered all the more\nwhat could have caused that vanished flash of beauty in a mind like his.\n\nThere was no trace of it now. His attention was completely taken up by\nthe voice of van Manderpootz, who had passed from a personal appraisal\nof Carter's stupidity to a general lecture on the fallacies of the\nunified field theory as presented by his rivals Corveille and Shrimski.\nCarter was listening with an almost worshipful regard, and I could feel\nhis surges of indignation against the villains who dared to disagree\nwith the authority of van Manderpootz.\n\nI sat there intent on the strange double vision of the attitudinizor,\nwhich was in some respects like a Horsten psychomat--that is, one is\nable to see both through his own eyes and through the eyes of his\nsubject. Thus I could see van Manderpootz and Carter quite clearly, but\nat the same time I could see or sense what Carter saw and sensed. Thus I\nperceived suddenly through my own eyes that the professor had ceased\ntalking to Carter, and had turned at the approach of somebody as yet\ninvisible to me, while at the same time, through Carter's eyes, I saw\nthat vision of ecstasy which had flashed for a moment in his mind. I\nsaw--description is utterly impossible, but I saw a woman who, except\npossibly for the woman of the idealizator screen, was the most beautiful\ncreature I had ever seen!\n\nI say description is impossible. That is the literal truth, for her\ncoloring, her expression, her figure, as seen through Carter's eyes,\nwere completely unlike anything expressible by words. I was fascinated,\nI could do nothing but watch, and I felt a wild surge of jealousy as I\ncaught the adoration in the attitude of the humble Carter. She was\nglorious, magnificent, indescribable. It was with an effort that I\nuntangled myself from the web of fascination enough to catch Carter's\nthought of her name. \"Lisa,\" he was thinking. \"Lisa.\"\n\nWhat she said to van Manderpootz was in tones too low for me to hear,\nand apparently too low for Carter's ears as well, else I should have\nheard her words through the attitudinizor. But both of us heard van\nManderpootz's bellow in answer.\n\n\"I don't care how the dictionary pronounces the word!\" he roared. \"The\nway van Manderpootz pronounces a word is right!\"\n\nThe glorious Lisa turned silently and vanished. For a few moments I\nwatched her through Carter's eyes, but as she neared the laboratory\ndoor, he turned his attention again to van Manderpootz, and she was lost\nto my view.\n\nAnd as I saw the professor close his dissertation and approach me, I\nslipped the attitudinizor from my head and forced myself to a measure of\ncalm.\n\n\"Who is she?\" I demanded. \"I've got to meet her!\"\n\nHe looked blankly at me. \"Who's who?\"\n\n\"Lisa! Who's Lisa?\"\n\nThere was not a flicker in the cool blue eyes of van Manderpootz. \"I\ndon't know any Lisa,\" he said indifferently.\n\n\"But you were just talking to her! Right out there!\"\n\nVan Manderpootz stared curiously at me; then little by little a shrewd\nsuspicion seemed to dawn in his broad, intelligent features. \"Hah!\" he\nsaid. \"Have you, by any chance, been using the attitudinizor?\"\n\nI nodded, chill apprehension gripping me.\n\n\"And is it also true that you chose to investigate the viewpoint of\nCarter out there?\" At my nod, he stepped to the door that joined the two\nrooms, and closed it. When he faced me again, it was with features\nworking into lines of amusement that suddenly found utterance in booming\nlaughter. \"Haw!\" he roared. \"Do you know who beautiful Lisa is? She's\nFitch!\"\n\n\"Fitch? You're mad! She's glorious, and Fitch is plain and scrawny and\nugly. Do you think I'm a fool?\"\n\n\"You ask an embarrassing question,\" chuckled the professor. \"Listen to\nme, Dixon. The woman you saw was my secretary, Miss Fitch, seen through\nthe eyes of Carter. Don't you understand? The idiot Carter's in love\nwith her!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI suppose I walked the upper levels half the night, oblivious alike of\nthe narrow strip of stars that showed between the towering walls of\ntwenty-first century New York, and the intermittent roar of traffic\nfrom the freight levels. Certainly this was the worst predicament of all\nthose into which the fiendish contraptions of the great van Manderpootz\nhad thrust me.\n\nIn love with a point of view! In love with a woman who had no existence\napart from the beglamoured eyes of Carter. It wasn't Lisa Fitch I loved;\nindeed, I rather hated her angular ugliness. What I had fallen in love\nwith was the way she looked to Carter, for there is nothing in the world\nquite as beautiful as a lover's conception of his sweetheart.\n\nThis predicament was far worse than my former ones. When I had fallen in\nlove with a girl already dead, I could console myself with the thought\nof what might have been. When I had fallen in love with my own\nideal--well, at least she was _mine_, even if I couldn't have her. But\nto fall in love with another man's conception! The only way that\nconception could even continue to exist was for Carter to remain in love\nwith Lisa Fitch, which rather effectually left me outside the picture\naltogether. She was absolutely unattainable to me, for Heaven knows I\ndidn't want the real Lisa Fitch--\"real\" meaning, of course, the one who\nwas real to me. I suppose in the end Carter's Lisa Fitch was as real as\nthe skinny scarecrow my eyes saw.\n\nShe was unattainable--or was she? Suddenly an echo of a long-forgotten\npsychology course recurred to me. Attitudes are habits. Viewpoints are\nattitudes. Therefore viewpoints are habits. And habits can be learned!\n\nThere was the solution! All I had to do was to learn, or to acquire by\npractice, the viewpoint of Carter. What I had to do was literally to put\nmyself in his place, to look at things in his way, to see his viewpoint.\nFor once I learned to do that, I could see in Lisa Fitch the very things\nhe saw, and the vision would become reality to me as well as to him.\n\nI planned carefully. I did not care to face the sarcasm of the great van\nManderpootz; therefore I would work in secret. I would visit his\nlaboratory at such times as he had classes or lectures, and I would use\nthe attitudinizor to study the viewpoint of Carter, and to, as it were,\npractice that viewpoint. Thus I would have the means at hand of testing\nmy progress, for all I had to do was glance at Miss Fitch without the\nattitudinizor. As soon as I began to perceive in her what Carter saw, I\nwould know that success was imminent.\n\nThose next two weeks were a strange interval of time. I haunted the\nlaboratory of van Manderpootz at odd hours, having learned from the\nUniversity office what periods he devoted to his courses. When one day I\nfound the attitudinizor missing, I prevailed on Carter to show me where\nit was kept, and he, influenced doubtless by my friendship for the man\nhe practically worshipped, indicated the place without question. But\nlater I suspect that he began to doubt his wisdom in this, for I know he\nthought it very strange for me to sit for long periods staring at him; I\ncaught all sorts of puzzled questions in his mind, though as I have\nsaid, these were hard for me to decipher until I began to learn Carter's\npersonal system of symbolism by which he thought. But at least one man\nwas pleased--my father, who took my absences from the office and neglect\nof business as signs of good health and spirits, and congratulated me\nwarmly on the improvement.\n\nBut the experiment was beginning to work, I found myself sympathizing\nwith Carter's viewpoint, and little by little the mad world in which he\nlived was becoming as logical as my own. I learned to recognize colors\nthrough his eyes; I learned to understand form and shape; most\nfundamental of all, I learned his values, his attitudes, his tastes. And\nthese last were a little inconvenient at times, for on the several\noccasions when I supplemented my daily calls with visits to van\nManderpootz in the evening, I found some difficulty in separating my own\nrespectful regard for the great man from Carter's unreasoning worship,\nwith the result that I was on the verge of blurting out the whole thing\nto him several times. And perhaps it was a guilty conscience, but I kept\nthinking that the shrewd blue eyes of the professor rested on me with a\ncuriously suspicious expression all evening.\n\nThe thing was approaching its culmination. Now and then, when I looked\nat the angular ugliness of Miss Fitch, I began to catch glimpses of the\nsame miraculous beauty that Carter found in her--glimpses only, but\nharbingers of success. Each day I arrived at the laboratory with\nincreasing eagerness, for each day brought me nearer to the achievement\nI sought. That is, my eagerness increased until one day I arrived to\nfind neither Carter nor Miss Fitch present, but van Manderpootz, who\nshould have been delivering a lecture on indeterminism, very much in\nevidence.\n\n\"Uh--hello,\" I said weakly.\n\n\"Umph!\" he responded, glaring at me. \"So Carter was right, I see. Dixon,\nthe abysmal stupidity of the human race continually astounds me with new\nevidence of its astronomical depths, but I believe this escapade of\nyours plumbs the uttermost regions of imbecility.\"\n\n\"M-my escapade?\"\n\n\"Do you think you can escape the piercing eye of van Manderpootz? As\nsoon as Carter told me you had been here in my absence, my mind leaped\nnimbly to the truth. But Carter's information was not even necessary,\nfor half an eye was enough to detect the change in your attitude on\nthese last few evening visits. So you've been trying to adopt Carter's\nviewpoint, eh? No doubt with the idea of ultimately depriving him of the\ncharming Miss Fitch!\"\n\n\"W-why--\"\n\n\"Listen to me, Dixon. We will disregard the ethics of the thing and look\nat it from a purely rational viewpoint, if a rational viewpoint is\npossible to anybody but van Manderpootz. Don't you realize that in order\nto attain Carter's attitude toward Fitch, you would have to adopt his\n_entire_ viewpoint? Not,\" he added tersely, \"that I think his point of\nview is greatly inferior to yours, but I happen to prefer the viewpoint\nof a donkey to that of a mouse. Your particular brand of stupidity is\nmore agreeable to me than Carter's timid, weak, and subservient nature,\nand some day you will thank me for this. Was his impression of Fitch\nworth the sacrifice of your own personality?\"\n\n\"I--I don't know.\"\n\n\"Well, whether it was or not, van Manderpootz has decided the matter in\nthe wisest way. For it's too late now, Dixon. I have given them both a\nmonth's leave and sent them away--on a honeymoon. They left this\nmorning.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Point of View, by Stanley Grauman Weinbaum\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE POINT OF VIEW ***\n\n***** This file should be named 22895.txt or 22895.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/2/8/9/22895/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Stephen Blundell and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
