Nourse\n\n\nJAMES BARON was not pleased to hear that he had had a visitor when he\nreached the Red Lion that evening. He had no stomach for mysteries, vast\nor trifling, and there were pressing things to think about at this time.\nYet the doorman had flagged him as he came in from the street: \u201cA\nthousand pardons, Mr. Baron. The gentleman\u2014he would leave no name. He\nsaid you\u2019d want to see him. He will be back by eight.\u201d\n\nNow Baron drummed his fingers on the table top, staring about the quiet\nlounge. Street trade was discouraged at the Red Lion, gently but\npersuasively; the patrons were few in number. Across to the right was a\ngroup that Baron knew vaguely\u2014Andean climbers, or at least two of them\nwere. Over near the door he recognized old Balmer, who had mapped the\nfirst passage to the core of Vulcan Crater on Venus. Baron returned his\nsmile with a nod. Then he settled back and waited impatiently for the\nintruder who demanded his time without justifying it.\n\nPresently a small, grizzled man crossed the room and sat down at Baron\u2019s\ntable. He was short and wiry. His face held no key to his age\u2014he might\nhave been thirty or a thousand\u2014but he looked weary and immensely ugly.\nHis cheeks and forehead were twisted and brown, with scars that were\nstill healing.\n\nThe stranger said, \u201cI\u2019m glad you waited. I\u2019ve heard you\u2019re planning to\nattempt the Brightside.\u201d\n\nBaron stared at the man for a moment. \u201cI see you can read telecasts,\u201d he\nsaid coldly. \u201cThe news was correct. We are going to make a Brightside\nCrossing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt perihelion?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course. When else?\u201d\n\nThe grizzled man searched Baron\u2019s face for a moment without expression.\nThen he said slowly, \u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re not going to make the\nCrossing.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay, who are you, if you don\u2019t mind?\u201d Baron demanded.\n\n\u201cThe name is Claney,\u201d said the stranger.\n\nThere was a silence. Then: \u201cClaney? _Peter_ Claney?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nBaron\u2019s eyes were wide with excitement, all trace of anger gone. \u201cGreat\nballs of fire, man\u2014_where have you been hiding?_ We\u2019ve been trying to\ncontact you for months!\u201d\n\n\u201cI know. I was hoping you\u2019d quit looking and chuck the whole idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuit looking!\u201d Baron bent forward over the table. \u201cMy friend, we\u2019d\ngiven up hope, but we\u2019ve never quit looking. Here, have a drink. There\u2019s\nso much you can tell us.\u201d His fingers were trembling.\n\nPeter Claney shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you anything you want to\nhear.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve _got_ to. You\u2019re the only man on Earth who\u2019s attempted a\nBrightside Crossing and lived through it! And the story you cleared for\nthe news\u2014it was nothing. We need _details_. Where did your equipment\nfall down? Where did you miscalculate? What were the trouble spots?\u201d\nBaron jabbed a finger at Claney\u2019s face. \u201cThat, for instance\u2014epithelioma?\nWhy? What was wrong with your glass? Your filters? We\u2019ve got to know\nthose things. If you can tell us, we can make it across where your\nattempt failed\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to know why we failed?\u201d asked Claney.\n\n\u201cOf course we want to know. We _have_ to know.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple. We failed because it can\u2019t be done. We couldn\u2019t do it and\nneither can you. No human beings will ever cross the Brightside alive,\nnot if they try for centuries.\u201d\n\n\u201cNonsense,\u201d Baron declared. \u201cWe will.\u201d\n\nClaney shrugged. \u201cI was there. I know what I\u2019m saying. You can blame the\nequipment or the men\u2014there were flaws in both quarters\u2014but we just\ndidn\u2019t know what we were fighting. It was the _planet_ that whipped us,\nthat and the _Sun_. They\u2019ll whip you, too, if you try it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever,\u201d said Baron.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you,\u201d Peter Claney said.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nI\u2019d been interested in the Brightside for almost as long as I can\nremember (Claney said). I guess I was about ten when Wyatt and Carpenter\nmade the last attempt\u2014that was in 2082, I think. I followed the news\nstories like a tri-V serial and then I was heartbroken when they just\ndisappeared.\n\nI know now that they were a pair of idiots, starting off without proper\nequipment, with practically no knowledge of surface conditions, without\nany charts\u2014they couldn\u2019t have made a hundred miles\u2014but I didn\u2019t know\nthat then and it was a terrible tragedy. After that, I followed\nSanderson\u2019s work in the Twilight Lab up there and began to get\nBrightside into my blood, sure as death.\n\nBut it was Mikuta\u2019s idea to attempt a Crossing. Did you ever know Tom\nMikuta? I don\u2019t suppose you did. No, not Japanese\u2014Polish-American. He\nwas a major in the Interplanetary Service for some years and hung onto\nthe title after he gave up his commission.\n\nHe was with Armstrong on Mars during his Service days, did a good deal\nof the original mapping and surveying for the Colony there. I first met\nhim on Venus; we spent five years together up there doing some of the\nnastiest exploring since the Matto Grasso. Then he made the attempt on\nVulcan Crater that paved the way for Balmer a few years later.\n\nI\u2019d always liked the Major\u2014he was big and quiet and cool, the sort of\nguy who always had things figured a little further ahead than anyone\nelse and always knew what to do in a tight place. Too many men in this\ngame are all nerve and luck, with no judgment. The Major had both. He\nalso had the kind of personality that could take a crew of wild men and\nmake them work like a well-oiled machine across a thousand miles of\nVenus jungle. I liked him and I trusted him.\n\nHe contacted me in New York and he was very casual at first. We spent an\nevening here at the Red Lion, talking about old times; he told me about\nthe Vulcan business, and how he\u2019d been out to see Sanderson and the\nTwilight Lab on Mercury, and how he preferred a hot trek to a cold one\nany day of the year\u2014and then he wanted to know what I\u2019d been doing since\nVenus and what my plans were.\n\n\u201cNo particular plans,\u201d I told him. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\nHe looked me over. \u201cHow much do you weigh, Peter?\u201d\n\nI told him one-thirty-five.\n\n\u201cThat much!\u201d he said. \u201cWell, there can\u2019t be much fat on you, at any\nrate. How do you take heat?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should know,\u201d I said. \u201cVenus was no icebox.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I mean _real_ heat.\u201d\n\nThen I began to get it. \u201cYou\u2019re planning a trip.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. A hot trip.\u201d He grinned at me. \u201cMight be dangerous, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat trip?\u201d\n\n\u201cBrightside of Mercury,\u201d the Major said.\n\nI whistled cautiously. \u201cAt aphelion?\u201d\n\nHe threw his head back. \u201cWhy try a Crossing at aphelion? What have you\ndone then? Four thousand miles of butcherous heat, just to have some\njoker come along, use your data and drum you out of the glory by\ncrossing at perihelion forty-four days later? No, thanks. I want the\nBrightside without any nonsense about it.\u201d He leaned across me eagerly.\n\u201cI want to make a Crossing at perihelion and I want to cross on the\nsurface. If a man can do that, he\u2019s got Mercury. Until then, _nobody\u2019s_\ngot Mercury. I want Mercury\u2014but I\u2019ll need help getting it.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d thought of it a thousand times and never dared consider it. Nobody\nhad, since Wyatt and Carpenter disappeared. Mercury turns on its axis in\nthe same time that it wheels around the Sun, which means that the\nBrightside is always facing in. That makes the Brightside of Mercury at\nperihelion the hottest place in the Solar System, with one single\nexception: the surface of the Sun itself.\n\nIt would be a hellish trek. Only a few men had ever learned just _how_\nhellish and they never came back to tell about it. It was a real hell\u2019s\nCrossing, but someday, I thought, somebody would cross it.\n\nI wanted to be along.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Twilight Lab, near the northern pole of Mercury, was the obvious\njumping-off place. The setup there wasn\u2019t very extensive\u2014a rocket\nlanding, the labs and quarters for Sanderson\u2019s crew sunk deep into the\ncrust, and the tower that housed the Solar \u2019scope that Sanderson had\nbuilt up there ten years before.\n\nTwilight Lab wasn\u2019t particularly interested in the Brightside, of\ncourse\u2014the Sun was Sanderson\u2019s baby and he\u2019d picked Mercury as the\nclosest chunk of rock to the Sun that could hold his observatory. He\u2019d\nchosen a good location, too. On Mercury, the Brightside temperature hits\n770\u00b0 F. at perihelion and the Darkside runs pretty constant at -410\u00b0 F.\nNo permanent installation with a human crew could survive at either\nextreme. But with Mercury\u2019s wobble, the twilight zone between Brightside\nand Darkside offers something closer to survival temperatures.\n\nSanderson built the Lab up near the pole, where the zone is about five\nmiles wide, so the temperature only varies 50 to 60 degrees with the\nlibration. The Solar \u2019scope could take that much change and they\u2019d get\ngood clear observation of the Sun for about seventy out of the\neighty-eight days it takes the planet to wheel around.\n\nThe Major was counting on Sanderson knowing something about Mercury as\nwell as the Sun when we camped at the Lab to make final preparations.\n\nSanderson did. He thought we\u2019d lost our minds and he said so, but he\ngave us all the help he could. He spent a week briefing Jack Stone, the\nthird member of our party, who had arrived with the supplies and\nequipment a few days earlier. Poor Jack met us at the rocket landing\nalmost bawling, Sanderson had given him such a gloomy picture of what\nBrightside was like.\n\nStone was a youngster\u2014hardly twenty-five, I\u2019d say\u2014but he\u2019d been with the\nMajor at Vulcan and had begged to join this trek. I had a funny feeling\nthat Jack really didn\u2019t care for exploring too much, but he thought\nMikuta was God, followed him around like a puppy.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter to me as long as he knew what he was getting in for.\nYou don\u2019t go asking people in this game why they do it\u2014they\u2019re liable to\nget awfully uneasy and none of them can ever give you an answer that\nmakes sense. Anyway, Stone had borrowed three men from the Lab, and had\nthe supplies and equipment all lined up when we got there, ready to\ncheck and test.\n\nWe dug right in. With plenty of funds\u2014tri-V money and some government\ncash the Major had talked his way around\u2014our equipment was new and good.\nMikuta had done the designing and testing himself, with a big assist\nfrom Sanderson. We had four Bugs, three of them the light pillow-tire\nmodels, with special lead-cooled cut-in engines when the heat set in,\nand one heavy-duty tractor model for pulling the sledges.\n\nThe Major went over them like a kid at the circus. Then he said, \u201cHave\nyou heard anything from McIvers?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s he?\u201d Stone wanted to know.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be joining us. He\u2019s a good man\u2014got quite a name for climbing,\nback home.\u201d The Major turned to me. \u201cYou\u2019ve probably heard of him.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d heard plenty of stories about Ted McIvers and I wasn\u2019t too happy to\nhear that he was joining us. \u201cKind of a daredevil, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe. He\u2019s lucky and skillful. Where do you draw the line? We\u2019ll need\nplenty of both.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you ever worked with him?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNo. Are you worried?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot exactly. But Brightside is no place to count on luck.\u201d\n\nThe Major laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to worry about McIvers. We\nunderstood each other when I talked up the trip to him and we\u2019re going\nto need each other too much to do any fooling around.\u201d He turned back to\nthe supply list. \u201cMeanwhile, let\u2019s get this stuff listed and packed.\nWe\u2019ll need to cut weight sharply and our time is short. Sanderson says\nwe should leave in three days.\u201d\n\nTwo days later, McIvers hadn\u2019t arrived. The Major didn\u2019t say much about\nit. Stone was getting edgy and so was I. We spent the second day\nstudying charts of the Brightside, such as they were. The best available\nwere pretty poor, taken from so far out that the detail dissolved into\nblurs on blow-up. They showed the biggest ranges of peaks and craters\nand faults, and that was all. Still, we could use them to plan a broad\noutline of our course.\n\n\u201cThis range here,\u201d the Major said as we crowded around the board, \u201cis\nlargely inactive, according to Sanderson. But these to the south and\nwest _could_ be active. Seismograph tracings suggest a lot of activity\nin that region, getting worse down toward the equator\u2014not only volcanic,\nbut sub-surface shifting.\u201d\n\nStone nodded. \u201cSanderson told me there was probably constant surface\nactivity.\u201d\n\nThe Major shrugged. \u201cWell, it\u2019s treacherous, there\u2019s no doubt of it. But\nthe only way to avoid it is to travel over the Pole, which would lose us\ndays and offer us no guarantee of less activity to the west. Now we\nmight avoid some if we could find a pass through this range and cut\nsharp east\u2014\u201d\n\nIt seemed that the more we considered the problem, the further we got\nfrom a solution. We knew there were active volcanoes on the\nBrightside\u2014even on the Darkside, though surface activity there was\npretty much slowed down and localized.\n\nBut there were problems of atmosphere on Brightside, as well. There was\nan atmosphere and a constant atmospheric flow from Brightside to\nDarkside. Not much\u2014the lighter gases had reached escape velocity and\ndisappeared from Brightside millennia ago\u2014but there was CO_{2}, and\nnitrogen, and traces of other heavier gases. There was also an abundance\nof sulfur vapor, as well as carbon disulfide and sulfur dioxide.\n\nThe atmospheric tide moved toward the Darkside, where it condensed,\ncarrying enough volcanic ash with it for Sanderson to estimate the depth\nand nature of the surface upheavals on Brightside from his samplings.\nThe trick was to find a passage that avoided those upheavals as far as\npossible. But in the final analysis, we were barely scraping the\nsurface. The only way we would find out what was happening where was to\nbe there.\n\nFinally, on the third day, McIvers blew in on a freight rocket from\nVenus. He\u2019d missed the ship that the Major and I had taken by a few\nhours, and had conned his way to Venus in hopes of getting a hop from\nthere. He didn\u2019t seem too upset about it, as though this were his usual\nway of doing things and he couldn\u2019t see why everyone should get so\nexcited.\n\nHe was a tall, rangy man with long, wavy hair prematurely gray, and the\nsort of eyes that looked like a climber\u2019s\u2014half-closed, sleepy, almost\nindolent, but capable of abrupt alertness. And he never stood still; he\nwas always moving, always doing something with his hands, or talking, or\npacing about.\n\nEvidently the Major decided not to press the issue of his arrival. There\nwas still work to do, and an hour later we were running the final tests\non the pressure suits. That evening, Stone and McIvers were thick as\nthieves, and everything was set for an early departure after we got some\nrest.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\n\u201cAnd that,\u201d said Baron, finishing his drink and signaling the waiter for\nanother pair, \u201cwas your first big mistake.\u201d\n\nPeter Claney raised his eyebrows. \u201cMcIvers?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\nClaney shrugged, glanced at the small quiet tables around them. \u201cThere\nare lots of bizarre personalities around a place like this, and some of\nthe best wouldn\u2019t seem to be the most reliable at first glance. Anyway,\npersonality problems weren\u2019t our big problem right then. _Equipment_\nworried us first and _route_ next.\u201d\n\nBaron nodded in agreement. \u201cWhat kind of suits did you have?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe best insulating suits ever made,\u201d said Claney. \u201cEach one had an\ninner lining of a fiberglass modification, to avoid the clumsiness of\nasbestos, and carried the refrigerating unit and oxygen storage which we\nrecharged from the sledges every eight hours. Outer layer carried a\nmonomolecular chrome reflecting surface that made us glitter like\nChristmas trees. And we had a half-inch dead-air space under positive\npressure between the two layers. Warning thermocouples, of course\u2014at 770\ndegrees, it wouldn\u2019t take much time to fry us to cinders if the suits\nfailed somewhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow about the Bugs?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were insulated, too, but we weren\u2019t counting on them too much for\nprotection.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t!\u201d Baron exclaimed. \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d be in and out of them too much. They gave us mobility and storage,\nbut we knew we\u2019d have to do a lot of forward work on foot.\u201d Claney\nsmiled bitterly. \u201cWhich meant that we had an inch of fiberglass and a\nhalf-inch of dead air between us and a surface temperature where lead\nflowed like water and zinc was almost at melting point and the pools of\nsulfur in the shadows were boiling like oatmeal over a campfire.\u201d\n\nBaron licked his lips. His fingers stroked the cool, wet glass as he set\nit down on the tablecloth.\n\n\u201cGo on,\u201d he said tautly. \u201cYou started on schedule?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d said Claney, \u201cwe started on schedule, all right. We just\ndidn\u2019t quite end on schedule, that was all. But I\u2019m getting to that.\u201d\n\nHe settled back in his chair and continued.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe jumped off from Twilight on a course due southeast with thirty days\nto make it to the Center of Brightside. If we could cross an average of\nseventy miles a day, we could hit Center exactly at perihelion, the\npoint of Mercury\u2019s closest approach to the Sun\u2014which made Center the\nhottest part of the planet at the hottest it ever gets.\n\nThe Sun was already huge and yellow over the horizon when we started,\ntwice the size it appears on Earth. Every day that Sun would grow bigger\nand whiter, and every day the surface would get hotter. But once we\nreached Center, the job was only half done\u2014we would still have to travel\nanother two thousand miles to the opposite twilight zone. Sanderson was\nto meet us on the other side in the Laboratory\u2019s scout ship,\napproximately sixty days from the time we jumped off.\n\nThat was the plan, in outline. It was up to us to cross those seventy\nmiles a day, no matter how hot it became, no matter what terrain we had\nto cross. Detours would be dangerous and time-consuming. Delays could\ncost us our lives. We all knew that.\n\nThe Major briefed us on details an hour before we left. \u201cPeter, you\u2019ll\ntake the lead Bug, the small one we stripped down for you. Stone and I\nwill flank you on either side, giving you a hundred-yard lead. McIvers,\nyou\u2019ll have the job of dragging the sledges, so we\u2019ll have to direct\nyour course pretty closely. Peter\u2019s job is to pick the passage at any\ngiven point. If there\u2019s any doubt of safe passage, we\u2019ll all explore\nahead on foot before we risk the Bugs. Got that?\u201d\n\nMcIvers and Stone exchanged glances. McIvers said: \u201cJack and I were\nplanning to change around. We figured he could take the sledges. That\nwould give me a little more mobility.\u201d\n\nThe Major looked up sharply at Stone. \u201cDo you buy that, Jack?\u201d\n\nStone shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t mind. Mac wanted\u2014\u201d\n\nMcIvers made an impatient gesture with his hands. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I\njust feel better when I\u2019m on the move. Does it make any difference?\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess it doesn\u2019t,\u201d said the Major. \u201cThen you\u2019ll flank Peter along\nwith me. Right?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, sure.\u201d McIvers pulled at his lower lip. \u201cWho\u2019s going to do the\nadvance scouting?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt sounds like I am,\u201d I cut in. \u201cWe want to keep the lead Bug light as\npossible.\u201d\n\nMikuta nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Peter\u2019s Bug is stripped down to the frame\nand wheels.\u201d\n\nMcIvers shook his head. \u201cNo, I mean the _advance_ work. You need\nsomebody out ahead\u2014four or five miles, at least\u2014to pick up the big flaws\nand active surface changes, don\u2019t you?\u201d He stared at the Major. \u201cI mean,\nhow can we tell what sort of a hole we may be moving into, unless we\nhave a scout up ahead?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we have the charts for,\u201d the Major said sharply.\n\n\u201cCharts! I\u2019m talking about _detail_ work. We don\u2019t need to worry about\nthe major topography. It\u2019s the little faults you can\u2019t see on the\npictures that can kill us.\u201d He tossed the charts down excitedly. \u201cLook,\nlet me take a Bug out ahead and work reconnaissance, keep five, maybe\nten miles ahead of the column. I can stay on good solid ground, of\ncourse, but scan the area closely and radio back to Peter where to avoid\nthe flaws. Then\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo dice,\u201d the Major broke in.\n\n\u201cBut why not? We could save ourselves days!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what we could save. We stay together. When we get to the\nCenter, I want live men along with me. That means we stay within easy\nsight of each other at all times. Any climber knows that everybody is\nsafer in a party than one man alone\u2014any time, any place.\u201d\n\nMcIvers stared at him, his cheeks an angry red. Finally he gave a sullen\nnod. \u201cOkay. If you say so.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I say so and I mean it. I don\u2019t want any fancy stuff. We\u2019re going\nto hit Center together, and finish the Crossing together. Got that?\u201d\n\nMcIvers nodded. Mikuta then looked at Stone and me and we nodded, too.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve got it straight, let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nIt was hot. If I forget everything else about that trek, I\u2019ll never\nforget that huge yellow Sun glaring down, without a break, hotter and\nhotter with every mile. We knew that the first few days would be the\neasiest and we were rested and fresh when we started down the long\nragged gorge southeast of the Twilight Lab.\n\nI moved out first; back over my shoulder, I could see the Major and\nMcIvers crawling out behind me, their pillow tires taking the rugged\nfloor of the gorge smoothly. Behind them, Stone dragged the sledges.\n\nEven at only 30 per cent Earth gravity they were a strain on the big\ntractor, until the ski-blades bit into the fluffy volcanic ash\nblanketing the valley. We even had a path to follow for the first twenty\nmiles.\n\nI kept my eyes pasted to the big polaroid binocs, picking out the track\nthe early research teams had made out into the edge of Brightside. But\nin a couple of hours we rumbled past Sanderson\u2019s little outpost\nobservatory and the tracks stopped. We were in virgin territory and\nalready the Sun was beginning to bite.\n\nWe didn\u2019t _feel_ the heat so much those first days out. We _saw_ it. The\nrefrig units kept our skins at a nice comfortable seventy-five degrees\nFahrenheit inside our suits, but our eyes watched that glaring Sun and\nthe baked yellow rocks going past, and some nerve pathways got twisted\nup, somehow. We poured sweat as if we were in a superheated furnace.\n\nWe drove eight hours and slept five. When a sleep period came due, we\npulled the Bugs together into a square, threw up a light aluminum\nsun-shield and lay out in the dust and rocks. The sun-shield cut the\ntemperature down sixty or seventy degrees, for whatever help that was.\nAnd then we ate from the forward sledge\u2014sucking through tubes\u2014protein,\ncarbohydrates, bulk gelatin, vitamins.\n\nThe Major measured water out with an iron hand, because we\u2019d have drunk\nourselves into nephritis in a week otherwise. We were constantly,\nunceasingly thirsty. Ask the physiologists and psychiatrists why\u2014they\ncan give you have a dozen interesting reasons\u2014but all we knew, or cared\nabout, was that it happened to be so.\n\nWe didn\u2019t sleep the first few stops, as a consequence. Our eyes burned\nin spite of the filters and we had roaring headaches, but we couldn\u2019t\nsleep them off. We sat around looking at each other. Then McIvers would\nsay how good a beer would taste, and off we\u2019d go. We\u2019d have murdered our\ngrandmothers for one ice-cold bottle of beer.\n\nAfter a few driving periods, I began to get my bearings at the wheel. We\nwere moving down into desolation that made Earth\u2019s old Death Valley look\nlike a Japanese rose garden. Huge sun-baked cracks opened up in the\nfloor of the gorge, with black cliffs jutting up on either side; the air\nwas filled with a barely visible yellowish mist of sulfur and sulfurous\ngases.\n\nIt was a hot, barren hole, no place for any man to go, but the challenge\nwas so powerful you could almost feel it. No one had ever crossed this\nland before and escaped. Those who had tried it had been cruelly\npunished, but the land was still there, so it had to be crossed. Not the\neasy way. It had to be crossed the hardest way possible: overland,\nthrough anything the land could throw up to us, at the most difficult\ntime possible.\n\nYet we knew that even the land might have been conquered before, except\nfor that Sun. We\u2019d fought absolute cold before and won. We\u2019d never\nfought heat like this and won. The only worse heat in the Solar System\nwas the surface of the Sun itself.\n\nBrightside was worth trying for. We would get it or it would get us.\nThat was the bargain.\n\nI learned a lot about Mercury those first few driving periods. The gorge\npetered out after a hundred miles and we moved onto the slope of a range\nof ragged craters that ran south and east. This range had shown no\nactivity since the first landing on Mercury forty years before, but\nbeyond it there were active cones. Yellow fumes rose from the craters\nconstantly; their sides were shrouded with heavy ash.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t detect a wind, but we knew there was a hot, sulfurous breeze\nsweeping in great continental tides across the face of the planet. Not\nenough for erosion, though. The craters rose up out of jagged gorges,\nhuge towering spears of rock and rubble. Below were the vast yellow\nflatlands, smoking and hissing from the gases beneath the crust. Over\neverything was gray dust\u2014silicates and salts, pumice and limestone and\ngranite ash, filling crevices and declivities\u2014offering a soft,\ntreacherous surface for the Bug\u2019s pillow tires.\n\nI learned to read the ground, to tell a covered fault by the sag of the\ndust; I learned to spot a passable crack, and tell it from an impassable\ncut. Time after time the Bugs ground to a halt while we explored a\npassage on foot, tied together with light copper cable, digging,\nadvancing, digging some more until we were sure the surface would carry\nthe machines. It was cruel work; we slept in exhaustion. But it went\nsmoothly, at first.\n\nToo smoothly, it seemed to me, and the others seemed to think so, too.\n\nMcIvers\u2019 restlessness was beginning to grate on our nerves. He talked\ntoo much, while we were resting or while we were driving; wisecracks,\nwitticisms, unfunny jokes that wore thin with repetition. He took to\nmaking side trips from the route now and then, never far, but a little\nfurther each time.\n\nJack Stone reacted quite the opposite; he grew quieter with each stop,\nmore reserved and apprehensive. I didn\u2019t like it, but I figured that it\nwould pass off after a while. I was apprehensive enough myself; I just\nmanaged to hide it better.\n\nAnd every mile the Sun got bigger and whiter and higher in the sky and\nhotter. Without our ultra-violet screens and glare filters we would have\nbeen blinded; as it was our eyes ached constantly and the skin on our\nfaces itched and tingled at the end of an eight-hour trek.\n\nBut it took one of those side trips of McIvers\u2019 to deliver the\npenultimate blow to our already fraying nerves. He had driven down a\nside-branch of a long canyon running off west of our route and was\nalmost out of sight in a cloud of ash when we heard a sharp cry through\nour earphones.\n\nI wheeled my Bug around with my heart in my throat and spotted him\nthrough the binocs, waving frantically from the top of his machine. The\nMajor and I took off, lumbering down the gulch after him as fast as the\nBugs could go, with a thousand horrible pictures racing through our\nminds....\n\nWe found him standing stock-still, pointing down the gorge and, for\nonce, he didn\u2019t have anything to say. It was the wreck of a Bug; an\nold-fashioned half-track model of the sort that hadn\u2019t been in use for\nyears. It was wedged tight in a cut in the rock, an axle broken, its\ncasing split wide open up the middle, half-buried in a rock slide. A\ndozen feet away were two insulated suits with white bones gleaming\nthrough the fiberglass helmets.\n\nThis was as far as Wyatt and Carpenter had gotten on _their_ Brightside\nCrossing.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the fifth driving period out, the terrain began to change. It looked\nthe same, but every now and then it _felt_ different. On two occasions I\nfelt my wheels spin, with a howl of protest from my engine. Then, quite\nsuddenly, the Bug gave a lurch; I gunned my motor and nothing happened.\n\nI could see the dull gray stuff seeping up around the hubs, thick and\ntenacious, splattering around in steaming gobs as the wheels spun. I\nknew what had happened the moment the wheels gave and, a few minutes\nlater, they chained me to the tractor and dragged me back out of the\nmire. It looked for all the world like thick gray mud, but it was a pit\nof molten lead, steaming under a soft layer of concealing ash.\n\nI picked my way more cautiously then. We were getting into an area of\nrecent surface activity; the surface was really treacherous. I caught\nmyself wishing that the Major had okayed McIvers\u2019 scheme for an advanced\nscout; more dangerous for the individual, maybe, but I was driving blind\nnow and I didn\u2019t like it.\n\nOne error in judgment could sink us all, but I wasn\u2019t thinking much\nabout the others. I was worried about _me_, plenty worried. I kept\nthinking, better McIvers should go than me. It wasn\u2019t healthy thinking\nand I knew it, but I couldn\u2019t get the thought out of my mind.\n\nIt was a grueling eight hours and we slept poorly. Back in the Bug\nagain, we moved still more slowly\u2014edging out on a broad flat plateau,\ndodging a network of gaping surface cracks\u2014winding back and forth in an\neffort to keep the machines on solid rock. I couldn\u2019t see far ahead,\nbecause of the yellow haze rising from the cracks, so I was almost on\ntop of it when I saw a sharp cut ahead where the surface dropped six\nfeet beyond a deep crack.\n\nI let out a shout to halt the others; then I edged my Bug forward,\npeering at the cleft. It was deep and wide. I moved fifty yards to the\nleft, then back to the right.\n\nThere was only one place that looked like a possible crossing; a long,\nnarrow ledge of gray stuff that lay down across a section of the fault\nlike a ramp. Even as I watched it, I could feel the surface crust under\nthe Bug trembling and saw the ledge shift over a few feet.\n\nThe Major\u2019s voice sounded in my ears. \u201cHow about it, Peter?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. This crust is on roller skates,\u201d I called back.\n\n\u201cHow about that ledge?\u201d\n\nI hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m scared of it, Major. Let\u2019s backtrack and try to find a\nway around.\u201d\n\nThere was a roar of disgust in my earphones and McIvers\u2019 Bug suddenly\nlurched forward. It rolled down past me, picked up speed, with McIvers\nhunched behind the wheel like a race driver. He was heading past me\nstraight for the gray ledge.\n\nMy shout caught in my throat; I heard the Major take a huge breath and\nroar: \u201cMac! _stop that thing_, you fool!\u201d and then McIvers\u2019 Bug was out\non the ledge, lumbering across like a juggernaut.\n\nThe ledge jolted as the tires struck it; for a horrible moment, it\nseemed to be sliding out from under the machine. And then the Bug was\nacross in a cloud of dust, and I heard McIvers\u2019 voice in my ears,\nshouting in glee. \u201cCome on, you slowpokes. It\u2019ll hold you!\u201d\n\nSomething unprintable came through the earphones as the Major drew up\nalongside me and moved his Bug out on the ledge slowly and over to the\nother side. Then he said, \u201cTake it slow, Peter. Then give Jack a hand\nwith the sledges.\u201d His voice sounded tight as a wire.\n\nTen minutes later, we were on the other side of the cleft. The Major\nchecked the whole column; then he turned on McIvers angrily. \u201cOne more\ntrick like that,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019ll strap you to a rock and leave you.\nDo you understand me? _One more time_\u2014\u201d\n\nMcIvers\u2019 voice was heavy with protest. \u201cGood Lord, if we leave it up to\nClaney, he\u2019ll have us out here forever! Any blind fool could see that\nthat ledge would hold.\u201d\n\n\u201c_I_ saw it moving,\u201d I shot back at him.\n\n\u201cAll right, all right, so you\u2019ve got good eyes. Why all the fuss? We got\nacross, didn\u2019t we? But I say we\u2019ve got to have a little nerve and use it\nonce in a while if we\u2019re ever going to get across this lousy hotbox.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to use a little judgment, too,\u201d the Major snapped. \u201cAll right,\nlet\u2019s roll. But if you think I was joking, you just try me out once.\u201d He\nlet it soak in for a minute. Then he geared his Bug on around to my\nflank again.\n\nAt the stopover, the incident wasn\u2019t mentioned again, but the Major drew\nme aside just as I was settling down for sleep. \u201cPeter, I\u2019m worried,\u201d he\nsaid slowly.\n\n\u201cMcIvers? Don\u2019t worry. He\u2019s not as reckless as he seems\u2014just impatient.\nWe are over a hundred miles behind schedule and we\u2019re moving awfully\nslow. We only made forty miles this last drive.\u201d\n\nThe Major shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t mean McIvers. I mean the kid.\u201d\n\n\u201cJack? What about him?\u201d\n\n\u201cTake a look.\u201d\n\nStone was shaking. He was over near the tractor\u2014away from the rest of\nus\u2014and he was lying on his back, but he wasn\u2019t asleep. His whole body\nwas shaking, convulsively. I saw him grip an outcropping of rock hard.\n\nI walked over and sat down beside him. \u201cGet your water all right?\u201d I\nsaid.\n\nHe didn\u2019t answer. He just kept on shaking.\n\n\u201cHey, boy,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the trouble?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hot,\u201d he said, choking out the words.\n\n\u201cSure it\u2019s hot, but don\u2019t let it throw you. We\u2019re in really good shape.\u201d\n\n\u201c_We\u2019re not_,\u201d he snapped. \u201cWe\u2019re in rotten shape, if you ask me. _We\u2019re\nnot going to make it_, do you know that? That crazy fool\u2019s going to kill\nus for sure\u2014\u201d All of a sudden, he was bawling like a baby. \u201cI\u2019m scared\u2014I\nshouldn\u2019t be here\u2014I\u2019m _scared_. What am I trying to prove by coming out\nhere, for God\u2019s sake? I\u2019m some kind of hero or something? I tell you I\u2019m\nscared\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d I said. \u201cMikuta\u2019s scared, _I\u2019m_ scared. So what? We\u2019ll make it,\ndon\u2019t worry. And nobody\u2019s trying to be a hero.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody but Hero Stone,\u201d he said bitterly. He shook himself and gave a\ntight little laugh. \u201cSome hero, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll make it,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d he said finally. \u201cSorry. I\u2019ll be okay.\u201d\n\nI rolled over, but waited until he was good and quiet. Then I tried to\nsleep, but I didn\u2019t sleep too well. I kept thinking about that ledge.\nI\u2019d known from the look of it what it was; a zinc slough of the sort\nSanderson had warned us about, a wide sheet of almost pure zinc that had\nbeen thrown up white-hot from below, quite recently, just waiting for\noxygen or sulfur to rot it through.\n\nI knew enough about zinc to know that at these temperatures it gets\nbrittle as glass. Take a chance like McIvers had taken and the whole\nsheet could snap like a dry pine board. And it wasn\u2019t McIvers\u2019 fault\nthat it hadn\u2019t.\n\nFive hours later, we were back at the wheel. We were hardly moving at\nall. The ragged surface was almost impassable\u2014great jutting rocks\npeppered the plateau; ledges crumbled the moment my tires touched them;\nlong, open canyons turned into lead-mires or sulfur pits.\n\nA dozen times I climbed out of the Bug to prod out an uncertain area\nwith my boots and pikestaff. Whenever I did, McIvers piled out behind\nme, running ahead like a schoolboy at the fair, then climbing back again\nred-faced and panting, while we moved the machines ahead another mile or\ntwo.\n\nTime was pressing us now and McIvers wouldn\u2019t let me forget it. We had\nmade only about three hundred twenty miles in six driving periods, so we\nwere about a hundred miles or even more behind schedule.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to make it,\u201d McIvers would complain angrily. \u201cThat\nSun\u2019s going to be out to aphelion by the time we hit the Center\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry, but I can\u2019t take it any faster,\u201d I told him. I was getting good\nand mad. I knew what he wanted, but didn\u2019t dare let him have it. I was\nscared enough pushing the Bug out on those ledges, even knowing that at\nleast _I_ was making the decisions. Put him in the lead and we wouldn\u2019t\nlast for eight hours. Our nerves wouldn\u2019t take it, at any rate, even if\nthe machines would.\n\nJack Stone looked up from the aluminum chart sheets. \u201cAnother hundred\nmiles and we should hit a good stretch,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe we can make up\ndistance there for a couple of days.\u201d\n\nThe Major agreed, but McIvers couldn\u2019t hold his impatience. He kept\nstaring up at the Sun as if he had a personal grudge against it and\nstamped back and forth under the sunshield. \u201cThat\u2019ll be just fine,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201c_If_ we ever get that far, that is.\u201d\n\nWe dropped it there, but the Major stopped me as we climbed aboard for\nthe next run. \u201cThat guy\u2019s going to blow wide open if we don\u2019t move\nfaster, Peter. I don\u2019t want him in the lead, no matter what happens.\nHe\u2019s right though, about the need to make better time. Keep your head,\nbut crowd your luck a little, okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d I said. It was asking the impossible and Mikuta knew it. We\nwere on a long downward slope that shifted and buckled all around us, as\nthough there were a molten underlay beneath the crust; the slope was\nbroken by huge crevasses, partly covered with dust and zinc sheeting,\nlike a vast glacier of stone and metal. The outside temperature\nregistered 547\u00b0 F. and getting hotter. It was no place to start rushing\nahead.\n\nI tried it anyway. I took half a dozen shaky passages, edging slowly out\non flat zinc ledges, then toppling over and across. It seemed easy for a\nwhile and we made progress. We hit an even stretch and raced ahead. And\nthen I quickly jumped on my brakes and jerked the Bug to a halt in a\ncloud of dust.\n\nI\u2019d gone too far. We were out on a wide, flat sheet of gray stuff,\napparently solid\u2014until I\u2019d suddenly caught sight of the crevasse beneath\nin the corner of my eye. It was an overhanging shell that trembled under\nme as I stopped.\n\nMcIvers\u2019 voice was in my ear. \u201cWhat\u2019s the trouble now, Claney?\u201d\n\n\u201cMove back!\u201d I shouted. \u201cIt can\u2019t hold us!\u201d\n\n\u201cLooks solid enough from here.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to argue about it? It\u2019s too thin, it\u2019ll snap. Move back!\u201d\n\nI started edging back down the ledge. I heard McIvers swear; then I saw\nhis Bug start to creep _outward_ on the shelf. Not fast or reckless,\nthis time, but slowly, churning up dust in a gentle cloud behind him.\n\nI just stared and felt the blood rush to my head. It seemed so hot I\ncould hardly breathe as he edged out beyond me, further and further\u2014\n\nI think I felt it snap before I saw it. My own machine gave a sickening\nlurch and a long black crack appeared across the shelf\u2014and widened. Then\nthe ledge began to upend. I heard a scream as McIvers\u2019 Bug rose up and\nup and then crashed down into the crevasse in a thundering slide of rock\nand shattered metal.\n\nI just stared for a full minute, I think. I couldn\u2019t move until I heard\nJack Stone groan and the Major shouting, \u201cClaney! I couldn\u2019t see\u2014what\n_happened_?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt snapped on him, that\u2019s what happened,\u201d I roared. I gunned my motor,\nedged forward toward the fresh broken edge of the shelf. The crevasse\ngaped; I couldn\u2019t see any sign of the machine. Dust was still billowing\nup blindingly from below.\n\nWe stood staring down, the three of us. I caught a glimpse of Jack\nStone\u2019s face through his helmet. It wasn\u2019t pretty.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the Major heavily, \u201cthat\u2019s that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess so.\u201d I felt the way Stone looked.\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d said Stone. \u201cI heard something.\u201d\n\nHe had. It was a cry in the earphones\u2014faint, but unmistakable.\n\n\u201cMac!\u201d The Major called. \u201cMac, can you hear me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, yeah. I can hear you.\u201d The voice was very weak.\n\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Broken leg, I think. It\u2019s\u2014hot.\u201d There was a long pause.\nThen: \u201cI think my cooler\u2019s gone out.\u201d\n\nThe Major shot me a glance, then turned to Stone. \u201cGet a cable from the\nsecond sledge fast. He\u2019ll fry alive if we don\u2019t get him out of there.\nPeter, I need you to lower me. Use the tractor winch.\u201d\n\nI lowered him; he stayed down only a few moments. When I hauled him up,\nhis face was drawn. \u201cStill alive,\u201d he panted. \u201cHe won\u2019t be very long,\nthough.\u201d He hesitated for just an instant. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make a try.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like this ledge,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s moved twice since I got out.\nWhy not back off and lower him a cable?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo good. The Bug is smashed and he\u2019s inside it. We\u2019ll need torches and\nI\u2019ll need one of you to help.\u201d He looked at me and then gave Stone a\nlong look. \u201cPeter, you\u2019d better come.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d said Stone. His face was very white. \u201cLet me go down with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeter is lighter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not so heavy. Let me go down.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, if that\u2019s the way you want it.\u201d The Major tossed him a torch.\n\u201cPeter, check these hitches and lower us slowly. If you see any kind of\ntrouble, _anything_, cast yourself free and back off this thing, do you\nunderstand? This whole ledge may go.\u201d\n\nI nodded. \u201cGood luck.\u201d\n\nThey went over the ledge. I let the cable down bit by bit until it hit\ntwo hundred feet and slacked off.\n\n\u201cHow does it look?\u201d I shouted.\n\n\u201cBad,\u201d said the Major. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to work fast. This whole side of the\ncrevasse is ready to crumble. Down a little more.\u201d\n\nMinutes passed without a sound. I tried to relax, but I couldn\u2019t. Then I\nfelt the ground shift, and the tractor lurched to the side.\n\nThe Major shouted, \u201c_It\u2019s going, Peter\u2014pull back!_\u201d and I threw the\ntractor into reverse, jerked the controls as the tractor rumbled off the\nshelf. The cable snapped, coiled up in front like a broken clockspring.\nThe whole surface under me was shaking wildly now; ash rose in huge gray\nclouds. Then, with a roar, the whole shelf lurched and slid sideways. It\nteetered on the edge for seconds before it crashed into the crevasse,\ntearing the side wall down with it in a mammoth slide. I jerked the\ntractor to a halt as the dust and flame billowed up.\n\nThey were gone\u2014all three of them, McIvers and the Major and Jack\nStone\u2014buried under a thousand tons of rock and zinc and molten lead.\nThere wasn\u2019t any danger of anybody ever finding their bones.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nPeter Claney leaned back, finishing his drink, rubbing his scarred face\nas he looked across at Baron.\n\nSlowly, Baron\u2019s grip relaxed on the chair arm. \u201c_You_ got back,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\nClaney nodded. \u201cI got back, sure. I had the tractor and the sledges. I\nhad seven days to drive back under that yellow Sun. I had plenty of time\nto think.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou took the wrong man along,\u201d Baron said. \u201cThat was your mistake.\nWithout him you would have made it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever.\u201d Claney shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s what I was thinking the first\nday or so\u2014that it was _McIvers\u2019_ fault, that _he_ was to blame. But that\nisn\u2019t true. He was wild, reckless and had lots of nerve.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut his judgment was bad!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been sounder. We had to keep to our schedule even if\nit killed us, because it would positively kill us if we didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut a man like that\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cA man like McIvers was necessary. Can\u2019t you see that? It was the Sun\nthat beat us, that surface. Perhaps we were licked the very day we\nstarted.\u201d Claney leaned across the table, his eyes pleading. \u201cWe didn\u2019t\nrealize that, but it was _true_. There are places that men can\u2019t go,\nconditions men can\u2019t tolerate. The others had to die to learn that. I\nwas lucky, I came back. But I\u2019m trying to tell you what I found out\u2014that\n_nobody_ will ever make a Brightside Crossing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will,\u201d said Baron. \u201cIt won\u2019t be a picnic, but we\u2019ll make it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut suppose you do,\u201d said Claney, suddenly. \u201cSuppose I\u2019m all wrong,\nsuppose you _do_ make it. Then what? _What comes next?_\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Sun,\u201d said Baron.\n\nClaney nodded slowly. \u201cYes. That would be it, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d He laughed.\n\u201cGood-by, Baron. Jolly talk and all that. Thanks for listening.\u201d\n\nBaron caught his wrist as he started to rise. \u201cJust one question more,\nClaney. Why did you come here?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo try to talk you out of killing yourself,\u201d said Claney.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a liar,\u201d said Baron.\n\nClaney stared down at him for a long moment. Then he crumpled in the\nchair. There was defeat in his pale blue eyes and something else.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d\n\nPeter Claney spread his hands, a helpless gesture. \u201cWhen do you leave,\nBaron? I want you to take me along.\u201d\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n                           Transcriber\u2019s Note\n\n\nThis e-text was produced from \u201cTiger by the Tail and Other Science\nFiction Stories by Alan E.

It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org\n\n\n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\nlocations.

Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
