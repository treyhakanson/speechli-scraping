BEAM PIPER\n\nIllustrated by Miller\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    _The last enemy was the toughest of all--and conquering him\n    was in itself almost as dangerous as not conquering. For a\n    strange pattern of beliefs can make assassination an\n    honorable profession!_\n\n\n\n[Illustration: ]\n\n\n\nAlong the U-shaped table, the subdued clatter of dinnerware and the\nbuzz of conversation was dying out; the soft music that drifted down\nfrom the overhead sound outlets seemed louder as the competing noises\ndiminished. The feast was drawing to a close, and Dallona of Hadron\nfidgeted nervously with the stem of her wineglass as last-moment\ndoubts assailed her.\n\nThe old man at whose right she sat noticed, and reached out to lay his\nhand on hers.\n\n\"My dear, you're worried,\" he said softly. \"You, of all people,\nshouldn't be, you know.\"\n\n\"The theory isn't complete,\" she replied. \"And I could wish for more\npositive verification. I'd hate to think I'd got you into this--\"\n\nGarnon of Roxor laughed. \"No, no!\" he assured her. \"I'd decided upon\nthis long before you announced the results of your experiments. Ask\nGirzon; he'll bear me out.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" the young man who sat at Garnon's left said, leaning\nforward. \"Father has meant to take this step for a long time. He was\nwaiting until after the election, and then he decided to do it now, to\ngive you an opportunity to make experimental use of it.\"\n\nThe man on Dallona's right added his voice. Like the others at the\ntable, he was of medium stature, brown-skinned and dark-eyed, with a\nwide mouth, prominent cheekbones and a short, square jaw. Unlike the\nothers, he was armed, with a knife and pistol on his belt, and on the\nbreast of his black tunic he wore a scarlet oval patch on which a pair\nof black wings, with a tapering silver object between them had been\nsuperimposed.\n\n\"Yes, Lady Dallona; the Lord Garnon and I discussed this, oh, two\nyears ago at the least. Really, I'm surprised that you seem to shrink\nfrom it, now. Of course, you're Venus-born, and customs there may be\ndifferent, but with your scientific knowledge--\"\n\n\"That may be the trouble, Dirzed,\" Dallona told him. \"A scientist gets\nin the way of doubting, and one doubts one's own theories most of\nall.\"\n\n\"That's the scientific attitude, I'm told,\" Dirzed replied, smiling.\n\"But somehow, I cannot think of you as a scientist.\" His eyes traveled\nover her in a way that would have made most women, scientists or\notherwise, blush. It gave Dallona of Hadron a feeling of pleasure. Men\noften looked at her that way, especially here at Darsh. Novelty had\nsomething to do with it--her skin was considerably lighter than usual,\nand there was a pleasing oddness about the structure of her face. Her\nalleged Venusian origin was probably accepted as the explanation of\nthat, as of so many other things.\n\nAs she was about to reply, a man in dark gray, one of the\nupper-servants who were accepted as social equals by the Akor-Neb\nnobles, approached the table. He nodded respectfully to Garnon of\nRoxor.\n\n\"I hate to seem to hurry things, sir, but the boy's ready. He's in a\ntrance-state now,\" he reported, pointing to the pair of visiplates at\nthe end of the room.\n\nBoth of the ten-foot-square plates were activated. One was a solid\nluminous white; on the other was the image of a boy of twelve or\nfourteen, seated at a big writing machine. Even allowing for the fact\nthat the boy was in a hypnotic trance, there was an expression of\nidiocy on his loose-lipped, slack-jawed face, a pervading dullness.\n\n\"One of our best sensitives,\" a man with a beard, several places down\nthe table on Dallona's right, said. \"You remember him, Dallona; he\nproduced that communication from the discarnate Assassin, Sirzim.\nNormally, he's a low-grade imbecile, but in trance-state he's\nwonderful. And there can be no argument that the communications he\nproduces originates in his own mind; he doesn't have mind enough, of\nhis own, to operate that machine.\"\n\nGarnon of Roxor rose to his feet, the others rising with him. He\nunfastened a jewel from the front of his tunic and handed it to\nDallona.\n\n\"Here, my dear Lady Dallona; I want you to have this,\" he said. \"It's\nbeen in the family of Roxor for six generations, but I know that you\nwill appreciate and cherish it.\" He twisted a heavy ring from his left\nhand and gave it to his son. He unstrapped his wrist watch and passed\nit across the table to the gray-clad upper-servant. He gave a pocket\ncase, containing writing tools, slide rule and magnifier, to the\nbearded man on the other side of Dallona. \"Something you can use, Dr.\nHarnosh,\" he said. Then he took a belt, with a knife and holstered\npistol, from a servant who had brought it to him, and gave it to the\nman with the red badge. \"And something for you, Dirzed. The pistol's\nby Farnor of Yand, and the knife was forged and tempered on Luna.\"\n\nThe man with the winged-bullet badge took the weapons, exclaiming in\nappreciation. Then he removed his own belt and buckled on the gift.\n\n\"The pistol's fully loaded,\" Garnon told him.\n\nDirzed drew it and checked--a man of his craft took no statement about\nweapons without verification--then slipped it back into the holster.\n\n\"Shall I use it?\" he asked.\n\n\"By all means; I'd had that in mind when I selected it for you.\"\n\nAnother man, to the left of Girzon, received a cigarette case and\nlighter. He and Garnon hooked fingers and clapped shoulders.\n\n\"Our views haven't been the same, Garnon,\" he said, \"but I've always\nvalued your friendship. I'm sorry you're doing this, now; I believe\nyou'll be disappointed.\"\n\nGarnon chuckled. \"Would you care to make a small wager on that,\nNirzav?\" he asked. \"You know what I'm putting up. If I'm proven right,\nwill you accept the Volitionalist theory as verified?\"\n\nNirzav chewed his mustache for a moment. \"Yes, Garnon, I will.\" He\npointed toward the blankly white screen. \"If we get anything\nconclusive on that, I'll have no other choice.\"\n\n\"All right, friends,\" Garnon said to those around him. \"Will you walk\nwith me to the end of the room?\"\n\nServants removed a section from the table in front of him, to allow\nhim and a few others to pass through; the rest of the guests remained\nstanding at the table, facing toward the inside of the room. Garnon's\nson, Girzon, and the gray-mustached Nirzav of Shonna, walked on his\nleft; Dallona of Hadron and Dr. Harnosh of Hosh on his right. The\ngray-clad upper-servant, and two or three ladies, and a nobleman with\na small chin-beard, and several others, joined them; of those who had\nsat close to Garnon, only the man in the black tunic with the scarlet\nbadge hung back. He stood still, by the break in the table, watching\nGarnon of Roxor walk away from him. Then Dirzed the Assassin drew the\npistol he had lately received as a gift, hefted it in his hand,\nthumbed off the safety, and aimed at the back of Garnon's head.\n\nThey had nearly reached the end of the room when the pistol cracked.\nDallona of Hadron started, almost as though the bullet had crashed\ninto her own body, then caught herself and kept on walking. She closed\nher eyes and laid a hand on Dr. Harnosh's arm for guidance,\nconcentrating her mind upon a single question. The others went on as\nthough Garnon of Roxor were still walking among them.\n\n\"Look!\" Harnosh of Hosh cried, pointing to the image in the visiplate\nahead. \"He's under control!\"\n\nThey all stopped short, and Dirzed, holstering his pistol, hurried\nforward to join them. Behind, a couple of servants had approached with\na stretcher and were gathering up the crumpled figure that had, a\nmoment ago, been Garnon.\n\nA change had come over the boy at the writing machine. His eyes were\nstill glazed with the stupor of the hypnotic trance, but the slack jaw\nhad stiffened, and the loose mouth was compressed in a purposeful\nline. As they watched, his hands went out to the keyboard in front of\nhim and began to move over it, and as they did, letters appeared on\nthe white screen on the left.\n\n_Garnon of Roxor, discarnate, communicating_, they read. The machine\nstopped for a moment, then began again. _To Dallona of Hadron: The\nquestion you asked, after I discarnated, was: What was the last book I\nread, before the feast? While waiting for my valet to prepare my bath,\nI read the first ten verses of the fourth Canto of \"Splendor of\nSpace,\" by Larnov of Horka, in my bedroom. When the bath was ready, I\nmarked the page with a strip of message tape, containing a message\nfrom the bailiff of my estate on the Shevva River, concerning a\nbreakdown at the power plant, and laid the book on the ivory-inlaid\ntable beside the big red chair._\n\nHarnosh of Hosh looked at Dallona inquiringly; she nodded.\n\n\"I rejected the question I had in my mind, and substituted that one,\nafter the shot,\" she said.\n\nHe turned quickly to the upper-servant. \"Check on that, right away,\nKirzon,\" he directed.\n\nAs the upper-servant hurried out, the writing machine started again.\n\n_And to my son, Girzon: I will not use your son, Garnon, as a\nreincarnation-vehicle; I will remain discarnate until he is grown and\nhas a son of his own; if he has no male child, I will reincarnate in\nthe first available male child of the family of Roxor, or of some\nfamily allied to us by marriage. In any case, I will communicate\nbefore reincarnating._\n\n_To Nirzav of Shonna: Ten days ago, when I dined at your home, I took\na small knife and cut three notches, two close together and one a\nlittle apart from the others, on the under side of the table. As I\nremember, I sat two places down on the left. If you find them, you\nwill know that I have won that wager that I spoke of a few minutes\nago._\n\n\"I'll have my butler check on that, right away,\" Nirzav said. His eyes\nwere wide with amazement, and he had begun to sweat; a man does not\ncasually watch the beliefs of a lifetime invalidated in a few moments.\n\n_To Dirzed the Assassin_: the machine continued. _You have served me\nfaithfully, in the last ten years, never more so than with the last\nshot you fired in my service. After you fired, the thought was in your\nmind that you would like to take service with the Lady Dallona of\nHadron, whom you believe will need the protection of a member of the\nSociety of Assassins. I advise you to do so, and I advise her to\naccept your offer. Her work, since she has come to Darsh, has not made\nher popular in some quarters. No doubt Nirzav of Shonna can bear me\nout on that._\n\n\"I won't betray things told me in confidence, or said at the Councils\nof the Statisticalists, but he's right,\" Nirzav said. \"You need a good\nAssassin, and there are few better than Dirzed.\"\n\n_I see that this sensitive is growing weary_, the letters on the\nscreen spelled out. _His body is not strong enough for prolonged\ncommunication. I bid you all farewell, for the time; I will\ncommunicate again. Good evening, my friends, and I thank you for your\npresence at the feast._\n\nThe boy, on the other screen, slumped back in his chair, his face\nrelaxing into its customary expression of vacancy.\n\n\"Will you accept my offer of service, Lady Dallona?\" Dirzed asked.\n\"It's as Garnon said; you've made enemies.\"\n\nDallona smiled at him. \"I've not been too deep in my work to know\nthat. I'm glad to accept your offer, Dirzed.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNirzav of Shonna had already turned away from the group and was\nhurrying from the room, to call his home for confirmation on the\nnotches made on the underside of his dining table. As he went out the\ndoor, he almost collided with the upper-servant, who was rushing in\nwith a book in his hand.\n\n\"Here it is,\" the latter exclaimed, holding up the book. \"Larnov's\n'Splendor of Space,' just where he said it would be. I had a couple of\nservants with me as witnesses; I can call them in now, if you wish.\"\nHe handed the book to Harnosh of Hosh. \"See, a strip of message tape\nin it, at the tenth verse of the Fourth Canto.\"\n\nNirzav of Shonna re-entered the room; he was chewing his mustache and\nmuttering to himself. As he rejoined the group in front of the now\ndark visiplates, he raised his voice, addressing them all generally.\n\n\"My butler found the notches, just as the communication described,\" he\nsaid. \"This settles it! Garnon, if you're where you can hear me,\nyou've won. I can't believe in the Statisticalist doctrines after\nthis, or in the political program based upon them. I'll announce my\nchange of attitude at the next meeting of the Executive Council, and\nresign my seat. I was elected by Statisticalist votes, and I cannot\nhold office as a Volitionalist.\"\n\n\"You'll need a couple of Assassins, too,\" the nobleman with the\nchin-beard told him. \"Your former colleagues and fellow-party-members\nare regrettably given to the forcible discarnation of those who differ\nwith them.\"\n\n\"I've never employed personal Assassins before,\" Nirzav replied, \"but\nI think you're right. As soon as I get home, I'll call Assassins' Hall\nand make the necessary arrangements.\"\n\n\"Better do it now,\" Girzon of Roxor told him, lowering his voice.\n\"There are over a hundred guests here, and I can't vouch for all of\nthem. The Statisticalists would be sure to have a spy planted among\nthem. My father was one of their most dangerous opponents, when he was\non the Council; they've always been afraid he'd come out of retirement\nand stand for re-election. They'd want to make sure he was really\ndiscarnate. And if that's the case, you can be sure your change of\nattitude is known to old Mirzark of Bashad by this time. He won't dare\nallow you to make a public renunciation of Statisticalism.\" He turned\nto the other nobleman. \"Prince Jirzyn, why don't you call the\nVolitionist headquarters and have a couple of our Assassins sent here\nto escort Lord Nirzav home?\"\n\n\"I'll do that immediately,\" Jirzyn of Starpha said. \"It's as Lord\nGirzon says; we can be pretty sure there was a spy among the guests,\nand now that you've come over to our way of thinking, we're\nresponsible for your safety.\"\n\nHe left the room to make the necessary visiphone call. Dallona,\naccompanied by Dirzed, returned to her place at the table, where she\nwas joined by Harnosh of Hosh and some of the others.\n\n\"There's no question about the results,\" Harnosh was exulting. \"I'll\ngrant that the boy might have picked up some of that stuff\ntelepathically from the carnate minds present here; even from the mind\nof Garnon, before he was discarnated. But he could not have picked up\nenough data, in that way, to make a connected and coherent\ncommunication. It takes a sensitive with a powerful mind of his own to\npractice telesthesia, and that boy's almost an idiot.\" He turned to\nDallona. \"You asked a question, mentally, after Garnon was\ndiscarnate, and got an answer that could have been contained only in\nGarnon's mind. I think it's conclusive proof that the discarnate\nGarnon was fully conscious and communicating.\"\n\n\"Dirzed also asked a question, mentally, after the discarnation, and\ngot an answer. Dr. Harnosh, we can state positively that the surviving\nindividuality is fully conscious in the discarnate state, is\ntelepathically sensitive, and is capable of telepathic communication\nwith other minds,\" Dallona agreed. \"And in view of our earlier work\nwith memory-recalls, we're justified in stating positively that the\nindividual is capable of exercising choice in reincarnation vehicles.\"\n\n\"My father had been considering voluntary discarnation for a long\ntime,\" Girzon of Roxor said. \"Ever since the discarnation of my\nmother. He deferred that step because he was unwilling to deprive the\nVolitionalist Party of his support. Now it would seem that he has done\nmore to combat Statisticalism by discarnating than he ever did in his\ncarnate existence.\"\n\n\"I don't know, Girzon,\" Jirzyn of Starpha said, as he joined the\ngroup. \"The Statisticalists will denounce the whole thing as a\nprearranged fraud. And if they can discarnate the Lady Dallona before\nshe can record her testimony under truth hypnosis or on a lie\ndetector, we're no better off than we were before. Dirzed, you have a\ngreat responsibility in guarding the Lady Dallona; some extraordinary\nsecurity precautions will be needed.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn his office, in the First Level city of Dhergabar, Tortha Karf,\nChief of Paratime Police, leaned forward in his chair to hold his\nlighter for his special assistant, Verkan Vall, then lit his own\ncigarette. He was a man of middle age--his three hundredth birthday\nwas only a decade or so off--and he had begun to acquire a double chin\nand a bulge at his waistline. His hair, once black, had turned a\nuniform iron-gray and was beginning to thin in front.\n\n\"What do you know about the Second Level Akor-Neb Sector, Vall?\" he\ninquired. \"Ever work in that paratime-area?\"\n\nVerkan Vall's handsome features became even more immobile than usual\nas he mentally pronounced the verbal trigger symbols which should\nbring hypnotically-acquired knowledge into his conscious mind. Then he\nshook his head.\n\n\"Must be a singularly well-behaved sector, sir,\" he said. \"Or else\nwe've been lucky, so far. I never was on an Akor-Neb operation; don't\neven have a hypno-mech for that sector. All I know is from general\nreading.\n\n\"Like all the Second Level, its time-lines descend from the\nprobability of one or more shiploads of colonists having come to Terra\nfrom Mars about seventy-five to a hundred thousand years ago, and then\nhaving been cut off from the home planet and forced to develop a\ncivilization of their own here. The Akor-Neb civilization is of a\nfairly high culture-order, even for Second Level. An atomic-power,\ninterplanetary culture; gravity-counteraction, direct conversion of\nnuclear energy to electrical power, that sort of thing. We buy fine\nsynthetic plastics and fabrics from them.\" He fingered the material of\nhis smartly-cut green police uniform. \"I think this cloth is Akor-Neb.\nWe sell a lot of Venusian _zerfa_-leaf; they smoke it, straight and\nmixed with tobacco. They have a single System-wide government, a\nsingle race, and a universal language. They're a dark-brown race,\nwhich evolved in its present form about fifty thousand years ago; the\npresent civilization is about ten thousand years old, developed out of\nthe wreckage of several earlier civilizations which decayed or fell\nthrough wars, exhaustion of resources, et cetera. They have legends,\nmaybe historical records, of their extraterrestrial origin.\"\n\nTortha Karf nodded. \"Pretty good, for consciously acquired knowledge,\"\nhe commented. \"Well, our luck's run out, on that sector; we have\ntroubles there, now. I want you to go iron them out. I know, you've\nbeen going pretty hard, lately--that nighthound business, on the\nFourth Level Europo-American Sector, wasn't any picnic. But the fact\nis that a lot of my ordinary and deputy assistants have a little too\nmuch regard for the alleged sanctity of human life, and this is\nsomething that may need some pretty drastic action.\"\n\n\"Some of our people getting out of line?\" Verkan Vall asked.\n\n\"Well, the data isn't too complete, but one of our people has run into\ntrouble on that sector, and needs rescuing--a psychic-science\nresearcher, a young lady named Hadron Dalla. I believe you know her,\ndon't you?\" Tortha Karf asked innocently.\n\n\"Slightly,\" Verkan Vall deadpanned. \"I enjoyed a brief but rather\nhectic companionate-marriage with her, about twenty years ago. What\nsort of a jam's little Dalla got herself into, now?\"\n\n\"Well, frankly, we don't know. I hope she's still alive, but I'm not\nunduly optimistic. It seems that about a year ago, Dr. Hadron\ntransposed to the Second Level, to study alleged proof of\nreincarnation which the Akor-Neb people were reported to possess. She\nwent to Gindrabar, on Venus, and transposed to the Second Paratime\nLevel, to a station maintained by Outtime Import & Export Trading\nCorporation--a _zerfa_ plantation just east of the High Ridge country.\nThere she assumed an identity as the daughter of a planter, and took\nthe name of Dallona of Hadron. Parenthetically, all Akor-Neb\nfamily-names are prepositional; family-names were originally place\nnames. I believe that ancient Akor-Neb marital relations were too\ncomplicated to permit exact establishment of paternity. And all\nAkor-Neb men's personal names have -_irz_- or -_arn_- inserted in the\nmiddle, and women's names end in -_itra_- or -_ona_. You could call\nyourself Virzal of Verkan, for instance.\n\n\"Anyhow, she made the Second Level Venus-Terra trip on a regular\npassenger liner, and landed at the Akor-Neb city of Ghamma, on the\nupper Nile. There she established contact with the Outtime Trading\nCorporation representative, Zortan Brend, locally known as Brarnend of\nZorda. He couldn't call himself Brarnend of Zortan--in the Akor-Neb\nlanguage, _zortan_ is a particularly nasty dirty-word. Hadron Dalla\nspent a few weeks at his residence, briefing herself on local\nconditions. Then she went to the capital city, Darsh, in eastern\nEurope, and enrolled as a student at something called the Independent\nInstitute for Reincarnation Research, having secured a letter of\nintroduction to its director, a Dr. Harnosh of Hosh.\n\n\"Almost at once, she began sending in reports to her home\norganization, the Rhogom Memorial Foundation of Psychic Science, here\nat Dhergabar, through Zortan Brend. The people there were wildly\nenthusiastic. I don't have more than the average intelligent--I\nhope--layman's knowledge of psychics, but Dr. Volzar Darv, the\ndirector of Rhogom Foundation, tells me that even in the present\nincomplete form, her reports have opened whole new horizons in the\nscience. It seems that these Akor-Neb people have actually\ndemonstrated, as a scientific fact, that the human individuality\nreincarnates after physical death--that your personality, and mine,\nhave existed, as such, for ages, and will exist for ages to come.\nMore, they have means of recovering, from almost anybody, memories of\npast reincarnations.\n\n[Illustration: ]\n\n\"Well, after about a month, the people at this Reincarnation Institute\nrealized that this Dallona of Hadron wasn't any ordinary student. She\nprobably had trouble keeping down to the local level of psychic\nknowledge. So, as soon as she'd learned their techniques, she was\nallowed to undertake experimental work of her own. I imagine she let\nherself out on that; as soon as she'd mastered the standard Akor-Neb\nmethods of recovering memories of past reincarnations, she began\nrefining and developing them more than the local yokels had been able\nto do in the past thousand years. I can't tell you just what she did,\nbecause I don't know the subject, but she must have lit things up\nproperly. She got quite a lot of local publicity; not only scientific\njournals, but general newscasts.\n\n\"Then, four days ago, she disappeared, and her disappearance seems to\nhave been coincident with an unsuccessful attempt on her life. We\ndon't know as much about this as we should; all we have is Zortan\nBrend's account.\n\n\"It seems that on the evening of her disappearance, she had been\nattending the voluntary discarnation feast--suicide party--of a\nprominent nobleman named Garnon of Roxor. Evidently when the Akor-Neb\npeople get tired of their current reincarnation they invite in their\nfriends, throw a big party, and then do themselves in in an atmosphere\nof general conviviality. Frequently they take poison or inhale lethal\ngas; this fellow had his personal trigger man shoot him through the\nhead. Dalla was one of the guests of honor, along with this Harnosh of\nHosh. They'd made rather elaborate preparations, and after the shooting\nthey got a detailed and apparently authentic spirit-communication from\nthe late Garnon. The voluntary discarnation was just a routine social\nevent, it seems, but the communication caused quite an uproar, and rated\ntop place on the System-wide newscasts, and started a storm of\ncontroversy.\n\n\"After the shooting and the communication, Dalla took the officiating\ngun artist, one Dirzed, into her own service. This Dirzed was spoken\nof as a generally respected member of something called the Society of\nAssassins, and that'll give you an idea of what things are like on\nthat sector, and why I don't want to send anybody who might develop\ntrigger-finger cramp at the wrong moment. She and Dirzed left the home\nof the gentleman who had just had himself discarnated, presumably for\nDalla's apartment, about a hundred miles away. That's the last that's\nbeen heard of either of them.\n\n\"This attempt on Dalla's life occurred while the pre-mortem revels\nwere still going on. She lived in a six-room apartment, with three\nservants, on one of the upper floors of a three-thousand-foot\ntower--Akor-Neb cities are built vertically, with considerable\ninterval between units--and while she was at this feast, a package was\ndelivered at the apartment, ostensibly from the Reincarnation\nInstitute and made up to look as though it contained record tapes. One\nof the servants accepted it from a service employee of the apartments.\nThe next morning, a little before noon, Dr. Harnosh of Hosh called her\non the visiphone and got no answer; he then called the apartment\nmanager, who entered the apartment. He found all three of the servants\ndead, from a lethal-gas bomb which had exploded when one of them had\nopened this package. However, Hadron Dalla had never returned to the\napartment, the night before.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nVerkan Vall was sitting motionless, his face expressionless as he ran\nTortha Karf's narrative through the intricate semantic and\npsychological processes of the First Level mentality. The fact that\nHadron Dalla had been a former wife of his had been relegated to one\ncorner of his consciousness and contained there; it was not a fact\nthat would, at the moment, contribute to the problem or to his\ntreatment of it.\n\n\"The package was delivered while she was at this suicide party,\" he\nconsidered. \"It must, therefore, have been sent by somebody who either\ndid not know she would be out of the apartment, or who did not expect\nit to function until after her return. On the other hand, if her\ndisappearance was due to hostile action, it was the work of somebody\nwho knew she was at the feast and did not want her to reach her\napartment again. This would seem to exclude the sender of the package\nbomb.\"\n\nTortha Karf nodded. He had reached that conclusion, himself.\n\n\"Thus,\" Verkan Vall continued, \"if her disappearance was the work of\nan enemy, she must have two enemies, each working in ignorance of the\nother's plans.\"\n\n\"What do you think she did to provoke such enmity?\"\n\n\"Well, of course, it just might be that Dalla's normally complicated\nlove-life had got a little more complicated than usual and\nshort-circuited on her,\" Verkan Vall said, out of the fullness of\npersonal knowledge, \"but I doubt that, at the moment. I would think\nthat this affair has political implications.\"\n\n\"So?\" Tortha Karf had not thought of politics as an explanation. He\nwaited for Verkan Vall to elaborate.\n\n\"Don't you see, chief?\" the special assistant asked. \"We find a belief\nin reincarnation on many time-lines, as a religious doctrine, but\nthese people accept it as a scientific fact. Such acceptance would\ncarry much more conviction; it would influence a people's entire\nthinking. We see it reflected in their disregard for death--suicide as\na social function, this Society of Assassins, and the like. It would\nnaturally color their political thinking, because politics is nothing\nbut common action to secure more favorable living conditions, and to\nthese people, the term 'living conditions' includes not only the\npresent life, but also an indefinite number of future lives as well. I\nfind this title, 'Independent' Institute, suggestive. Independent of\nwhat? Possibly of partisan affiliation.\"\n\n\"But wouldn't these people be grateful to her for her new discoveries,\nwhich would enable them to plan their future reincarnations more\nintelligently?\" Tortha Karf asked.\n\n\"Oh, chief!\" Verkan Vall reproached. \"You know better than that! How\nmany times have our people got in trouble on other time-lines because\nthey divulged some useful scientific fact that conflicted with the\nlocally revered nonsense? You show me ten men who cherish some\nreligious doctrine or political ideology, and I'll show you nine men\nwhose minds are utterly impervious to any factual evidence which\ncontradicts their beliefs, and who regard the producer of such\nevidence as a criminal who ought to be suppressed. For instance, on\nthe Fourth Level Europo-American Sector, where I was just working,\nthere is a political sect, the Communists, who, in the territory under\ntheir control, forbid the teaching of certain well-established facts\nof genetics and heredity, because those facts do not fit the\nworld-picture demanded by their political doctrines. And on the same\nsector, a religious sect recently tried, in some sections\nsuccessfully, to outlaw the teaching of evolution by natural\nselection.\"\n\nTortha Karf nodded. \"I remember some stories my grandfather told me,\nabout his narrow escapes from an organization called the Holy\nInquisition, when he was a paratime trader on the Fourth Level, about\nfour hundred years ago. I believe that thing's still operating, on the\nEuropo-American Sector, under the name of the NKVD. So you think Dalla\nmay have proven something that conflicted with local reincarnation\ntheories, and somebody who had a vested interest in maintaining those\ntheories is trying to stop her?\"\n\n\"You spoke of a controversy over the communication alleged to have\noriginated with this voluntarily discarnated nobleman. That would\nsuggest a difference of opinion on the manner of nature of\nreincarnation or the discarnate state. This difference may mark the\ndividing line between the different political parties. Now, to get to\nthis Darsh place, do I have to go to Venus, as Dalla did?\"\n\n\"No. The Outtime Trading Corporation has transposition facilities at\nRavvanan, on the Nile, which is spatially co-existent with the city of\nGhamma on the Akor-Neb Sector, where Zortan Brend is. You transpose\nthrough there, and Zortan Brend will furnish you transportation to\nDarsh. It'll take you about two days, here, getting your hypno-mech\nindoctrinations and having your skin pigmented, and your hair turned\nblack. I'll notify Zortan Brend at once that you're coming through.\nIs there anything special you'll want?\"\n\n\"Why, I'll want an abstract of the reports Dalla sent back to Rhogom\nFoundation. It's likely that there is some clue among them as to whom\nher discoveries may have antagonized. I'm going to be a Venusian\n_zerfa_-planter, a friend of her father's; I'll want full hypno-mech\nindoctrination to enable me to play that part. And I'll want to\nfamiliarize myself with Akor-Neb weapons and combat techniques. I\nthink that will be all, chief.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe last of the tall city-units of Ghamma were sliding out of sight as\nthe ship passed over them--shaft-like buildings that rose two or three\nthousand feet above the ground in clumps of three or four or six, one\nat each corner of the landing stages set in series between them. Each\nof these units stood in the middle of a wooded park some five miles\nsquare; no unit was much more or less than twenty miles from its\nnearest neighbor, and the land between was the uniform golden-brown of\nripening grain, crisscrossed with the threads of irrigation canals and\ndotted here and there with sturdy farm-village buildings and tall,\nstacklike granaries. There were a few other ships in the air at the\nfifty-thousand-foot level, and below, swarms of small airboats darted\nback and forth on different levels, depending upon speed and\ndirection. Far ahead, to the northeast, was the shimmer of the Red Sea\nand the hazy bulk of Asia Minor beyond.\n\nVerkan Vall--the Lord Virzal of Verkan, temporarily--stood at the\nglass front of the observation deck, looking down. He was a different\nVerkan Vall from the man who had talked with Tortha Karf in the\nlatter's office, two days before. The First Level cosmeticists had\nworked miracles upon him with their art. His skin was a soft\nchocolate-brown, now; his hair was jet-black, and so were his eyes.\nAnd in his subconscious mind, instantly available to consciousness,\nwas a vast body of knowledge about conditions on the Akor-Neb sector,\nas well as a complete command of the local language, all hypnotically\nacquired.\n\nHe knew that he was looking down upon one of the minor provincial\ncities of a very respectably advanced civilization. A civilization\nwhich built its cities vertically, since it had learned to counteract\ngravitation. A civilization which still depended upon natural cereals\nfor food, but one which had learned to make the most efficient use of\nits soil. The network of dams and irrigation canals which he saw was\nas good as anything on his own paratime level. The wide dispersal of\nbuildings, he knew, was a heritage of a series of disastrous atomic\nwars of several thousand years before; the Akor-Neb people had come to\nlove the wide inter-vistas of open country and forest, and had\ncontinued to scatter their buildings, even after the necessity had\npassed. But the slim, towering buildings could only have been reared\nby a people who had banished nationalism and, with it, the threat of\ntotal war. He contrasted them with the ground-hugging dome cities of\nthe Khiftan civilization, only a few thousand parayears distant.\n\nThree men came out of the lounge behind him and joined him. One was,\nlike himself, a disguised paratimer from the First Level--the Outtime\nExport and Import man, Zortan Brend, here known as Brarnend of Zorda.\nThe other two were Akor-Neb people, and both wore the black tunics and\nthe winged-bullet badges of the Society of Assassins. Unlike Verkan\nVall and Zortan Brend, who wore shoulder holsters under their short\ntunics, the Assassins openly displayed pistols and knives on their\nbelts.\n\n\"We heard that you were coming two days ago, Lord Virzal,\" Zortan\nBrend said. \"We delayed the take-off of this ship, so that you could\ntravel to Darsh as inconspicuously as possible. I also booked a suite\nfor you at the Solar Hotel, at Darsh. And these are your\nAssassins--Olirzon, and Marnik.\"\n\nVerkan Vall hooked fingers and clapped shoulders with them.\n\n\"Virzal of Verkan,\" he identified himself. \"I am satisfied to intrust\nmyself to you.\"\n\n\"We'll do our best for you, Lord Virzal,\" the older of the pair,\nOlirzon, said. He hesitated for a moment, then continued: \"Understand,\nLord Virzal, I only ask for information useful in serving and\nprotecting you. But is this of the Lady Dallona a political matter?\"\n\n\"Not from our side,\" Verkan Vall told him. \"The Lady Dallona is a\nscientist, entirely nonpolitical. The Honorable Brarnend is a business\nman; he doesn't meddle with politics as long as the politicians leave\nhim alone. And I'm a planter on Venus; I have enough troubles, with\nthe natives, and the weather, and blue-rot in the _zerfa_ plants, and\npoison roaches, and javelin bugs, without getting into politics. But\npsychic science is inextricably mixed with politics, and the Lady\nDallona's work had evidently tended to discredit the theory of\nStatistical Reincarnation.\"\n\n\"Do you often make understatements like that, Lord Virzal?\" Olirzon\ngrinned. \"In the last six months, she's knocked Statistical\nReincarnation to splinters.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm not a psychic scientist, and as I said, I don't know much\nabout Terran politics,\" Verkan Vall replied. \"I know that the\nStatisticalists favor complete socialization and political control of\nthe whole economy, because they want everybody to have the same\nopportunities in every reincarnation. And the Volitionalists believe\nthat everybody reincarnates as he pleases, and so they favor\ncontinuance of the present system of private ownership of wealth and\nprivate profit under a system of free competition. And that's about\nall I do know. Naturally, as a land-owner and the holder of a title of\nnobility, I'm a Volitionalist in politics, but the socialization\nissue isn't important on Venus. There is still too much unseated land\nthere, and too many personal opportunities, to make socialism\nattractive to anybody.\"\n\n\"Well, that's about it,\" Zortan Brend told him. \"I'm not enough of a\npsychicist to know what the Lady Dallona's been doing, but she's\nknocked the theoretical basis from under Statistical Reincarnation,\nand that's the basis, in turn, of Statistical Socialism. I think we'll\nfind that the Statisticalist Party is responsible for whatever\nhappened to her.\"\n\nMarnik, the younger of the two Assassins, hesitated for a moment, then\naddressed Verkan Vall:\n\n\"Lord Virzal, I know none of the personalities involved in this\nmatter, and I speak without wishing to give offense, but is it not\npossible that the Lady Dallona and the Assassin Dirzed may have gone\nsomewhere together voluntarily? I have met Dirzed, and he has many\nqualities which women find attractive, and he is by no means\nindifferent to the opposite sex. You understand, Lord Virzal--\"\n\n\"I understand all too perfectly, Marnik,\" Verkan Vall replied, out of\nthe fullness of experience. \"The Lady Dallona has had affairs with a\nnumber of men, myself among them. But under the circumstances, I find\nthat explanation unthinkable.\"\n\nMarnik looked at him in open skepticism. Evidently, in his book, where\nan attractive man and a beautiful woman were concerned, that\nexplanation was never unthinkable.\n\n\"The Lady Dallona is a scientist,\" Verkan Vall elaborated. \"She is not\nabove diverting herself with love affairs, but that's all they are--a\nnot too important form of diversion. And, if you recall, she had just\nparticipated in a most significant experiment: you can be sure that\nshe had other things on her mind at the time than pleasure jaunts with\ngood-looking Assassins.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe ship was passing around the Caucasus Mountains, with the Caspian\nSea in sight ahead, when several of the crew appeared on the\nobservation deck and began preparing the shielding to protect the deck\nfrom gunfire. Zortan Brend inquired of the petty officer in charge of\nthe work as to the necessity.\n\n\"We've been getting reports of trouble at Darsh, sir,\" the man said.\n\"Newscast bulletins every couple of minutes: rioting in different\nparts of the city. Started yesterday afternoon, when a couple of\nStatisticalist members of the Executive Council resigned and went over\nto the Volitionalists. Lord Nirzav of Shonna, the only nobleman of any\nimportance in the Statisticalist Party, was one of them; he was shot\nimmediately afterward, while leaving the Council Chambers, along with\na couple of Assassins who were with him. Some people in an airboat\nsprayed them with a machine rifle as they came out onto the landing\nstage.\"\n\nThe two Assassins exclaimed in horrified anger over this.\n\n\"That wasn't the work of members of the Society of Assassins!\" Olirzon\ndeclared. \"Even after he'd resigned, the Lord Nirzav was still immune\ntill he left the Government Building. There's too blasted much illegal\nassassination going on!\"\n\n\"What happened next?\" Verkan Vall wanted to know.\n\n\"About what you'd expect, sir. The Volitionalists weren't going to\ntake that quietly. In the past eighteen hours, four prominent\nStatisticalists were forcibly discarnated, and there was even a fight\nin Mirzark of Bashad's house, when Volitionalist Assassins broke in;\nthree of them and four of Mirzark's Assassins were discarnated.\"\n\n\"You know, something is going to have to be done about that, too,\"\nOlirzon said to Marnik. \"It's getting to a point where these political\nfaction fights are being carried on entirely between members of the\nSociety. In Ghamma alone, last year, thirty or forty of our members\nwere discarnated that way.\"\n\n\"Plug in a newscast visiplate, Karnil,\" Zortan Brend told the petty\nofficer. \"Let's see what's going on in Darsh now.\"\n\nIn Darsh, it seemed, an uneasy peace was being established. Verkan\nVall watched heavily-armed airboats and light combat ships patrolling\namong the high towers of the city. He saw a couple of minor riots\nbeing broken up by the blue-uniformed Constabulary, with considerable\nshooting and a ruthless disregard for who might get shot. It wasn't\nexactly the sort of policing that would have been tolerated in the\nFirst Level Civil Order Section, but it seemed to suit Akor-Neb\nconditions. And he listened to a series of angry recriminations and\ncontradictory statements by different politicians, all of whom blamed\nthe disorders on their opponents. The Volitionalists spoke of the\nStatisticalists as \"insane criminals\" and \"underminers of social\nstability,\" and the Statisticalists called the Volitionalists\n\"reactionary criminals\" and \"enemies of social progress.\" Politicians,\nhe had observed, differed little in their vocabularies from one\ntime-line to another.\n\nThis kept up all the while the ship was passing over the Caspian Sea;\nas they were turning up the Volga valley, one of the ship's officers\ncame down from the control deck, above.\n\n\"We're coming into Darsh, now,\" he said, and as Verkan Vall turned\nfrom the visiplate to the forward windows, he could see the white and\npastel-tinted towers of the city rising above the hardwood forests\nthat covered the whole Volga basin on this sector. \"Your luggage has\nbeen put into the airboat, Lord Virzal and Honorable Assassins, and\nit's ready for launching whenever you are.\" The officer glanced at his\nwatch. \"We dock at Commercial Center in twenty minutes; we'll be\npassing the Solar Hotel in ten.\"\n\nThey all rose, and Verkan Vall hooked fingers and clapped shoulders\nwith Zortan Brend.\n\n\"Good luck, Lord Virzal,\" the latter said. \"I hope you find the Lady\nDallona safe and carnate. If you need help, I'll be at Mercantile\nHouse for the next day or so; if you get back to Ghamma before I do,\nyou know who to ask for there.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA number of assassins loitered in the hallways and offices of the\nIndependent Institute of Reincarnation Research when Verkan Vall,\naccompanied by Marnik, called there that afternoon. Some of them\ncarried submachine-guns or sleep-gas projectors, and they were\nstopping people and questioning them. Marnik needed only to give them\na quick gesture and the words, \"Assassins' Truce,\" and he and his\nclient were allowed to pass. They entered a lifter tube and floated up\nto the office of Dr. Harnosh of Hosh, with whom Verkan Vall had made\nan appointment.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Lord Virzal,\" the director of the Institute told him, \"but\nI have no idea what has befallen the Lady Dallona, or even if she is\nstill carnate. I am quite worried; I admired her extremely, both as an\nindividual and as a scientist. I do hope she hasn't been discarnated;\nthat would be a serious blow to science. It is fortunate that she\naccomplished as much as she did, while she was with us.\"\n\n\"You think she is no longer carnate, then?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid so. The political effects of her discoveries--\" Harnosh of\nHosh shrugged sadly. \"She was devoted, to a rare degree, to her work.\nI am sure that nothing but her discarnation could have taken her away\nfrom us, at this time, with so many important experiments still\nuncompleted.\"\n\nMarnik nodded to Verkan Vall, as much as to say: \"You were right.\"\n\n\"Well, I intend acting upon the assumption that she is still carnate\nand in need of help, until I am positive to the contrary,\" Verkan Vall\nsaid. \"And in the latter case, I intend finding out who discarnated\nher, and send him to apologize for it in person. People don't forcibly\ndiscarnate my friends with impunity.\"\n\n\"Sound attitude,\" Dr. Harnosh commented. \"There's certainly no\npositive evidence that she isn't still carnate. I'll gladly give you\nall the assistance I can, if you'll only tell me what you want.\"\n\n\"Well, in the first place,\" Verkan Vall began, \"just what sort of work\nwas she doing?\" He already knew the answer to that, from the reports\nshe had sent back to the First Level, but he wanted to hear Dr.\nHarnosh's version. \"And what, exactly, are the political effects you\nmentioned? Understand, Dr. Harnosh, I am really quite ignorant of any\nscientific subject unrelated to _zerfa_ culture, and equally so of\nTerran politics. Politics, on Venus, is mainly a question of who gets\nhow much graft out of what.\"\n\nDr. Harnosh smiled; evidently he had heard about Venusian politics.\n\"Ah, yes, of course. But you are familiar with the main differences\nbetween Statistical and Volitional reincarnation theories?\"\n\n[Illustration: ]\n\n\"In a general way. The Volitionalists hold that the discarnate\nindividuality is fully conscious, and is capable of something\nanalogous to sense-perception, and is also capable of exercising\nchoice in the matter of reincarnation vehicles, and can reincarnate or\nremain in the discarnate state as it chooses. They also believe that\ndiscarnate individualities can communicate with one another, and with\nat least some carnate individualities, by telepathy,\" he said. \"The\nStatisticalists deny all this; their opinion is that the discarnate\nindividuality is in a more or less somnambulistic state, that it is\ndrawn by a process akin to tropism to the nearest available\nreincarnation vehicle, and that it must reincarnate in and only in\nthat vehicle. They are labeled Statisticalists because they believe\nthat the process of reincarnation is purely at random, or governed by\nunknown and uncontrollable causes, and is unpredictable except as to\naggregates.\"\n\n\"That's a fairly good generalized summary,\" Dr. Harnosh of Hosh\ngrudged, unwilling to give a mere layman too much credit. He dipped a\nspoon into a tobacco humidor, dusted the tobacco lightly with dried\n_zerfa_, and rammed it into his pipe. \"You must understand that our\nmodern Statisticalists are the intellectual heirs of those ancient\nmaterialistic thinkers who denied the possibility of any discarnate\nexistence, or of any extraphysical mind, or even of extrasensory\nperception. Since all these things have been demonstrated to be facts,\nthe materialistic dogma has been broadened to include them, but always\nstrictly within the frame of materialism.\n\n\"We have proven, for instance, that the human individuality can exist\nin a discarnate state, and that it reincarnates into the body of an\ninfant, shortly after birth. But the Statisticalists cannot accept the\nidea of discarnate consciousness, since they conceive of consciousness\npurely as a function of the physical brain. So they postulate an\nunconscious discarnate personality, or, as you put it, one in a\nsomnambulistic state. They have to concede memory to this discarnate\npersonality, since it was by recovery of memories of previous\nreincarnations that discarnate existence and reincarnation were proven\nto be facts. So they picture the discarnate individuality as a\nmaterial object, or physical event, of negligible but actual mass, in\nwhich an indefinite number of memories can be stored as electronic\ncharges. And they picture it as being drawn irresistibly to the body\nof the nearest non-incarnated infant. Curiously enough, the\nreincarnation vehicle chosen is almost always of the same sex as the\nvehicle of the previous reincarnation, the exceptions being cases of\npersons who had a previous history of psychological sex-inversion.\"\n\nDr. Harnosh remembered the unlighted pipe in his hand, thrust it into\nhis mouth, and lit it. For a moment, he sat with it jutting out of his\nblack beard, until it was drawing to his satisfaction. \"This belief in\nimmediate reincarnation leads the Statisticalists, when they fight\nduels or perform voluntary discarnation, to do so in the neighborhood\nof maternity hospitals,\" he added. \"I know, personally, of one\nreincarnation memory-recall, in which the subject, a Statisticalist,\nvoluntarily discarnated by lethal-gas inhaler in a private room at one\nof our local maternity hospitals, and reincarnated twenty years later\nin the city of Jeddul, three thousand miles away.\" The square black\nbeard jiggled as the scientist laughed.\n\n\"Now, as to the political implications of these contradictory\ntheories: Since the Statisticalists believe that they will reincarnate\nentirely at random, their aim is to create an utterly classless social\nand economic order, in which, theoretically, each individuality will\nreincarnate into a condition of equality with everybody else. Their\npolitical program, therefore, is one of complete socialization of all\nmeans of production and distribution, abolition of hereditary titles\nand inherited wealth--eventually, all private wealth--and total\ngovernment control of all economic, social and cultural activities. Of\ncourse,\" Dr. Harnosh apologized, \"politics isn't my subject; I\nwouldn't presume to judge how that would function in practice.\"\n\n\"I would,\" Verkan Vall said shortly, thinking of all the different\ntime-lines on which he had seen systems like that in operation. \"You\nwouldn't like it, doctor. And the Volitionalists?\"\n\n\"Well, since they believe that they are able to choose the\ncircumstances of their next reincarnations for themselves, they are\nthe party of the _status quo_. Naturally, almost all the nobles,\nalmost all the wealthy trading and manufacturing families, and almost\nall professional people, are Volitionalists; most of the workers and\npeasants are Statisticalists. Or, at least, they were, for the most\npart, before we began announcing the results of the Lady Dallona's\nexperimental work.\"\n\n\"Ah; now we come to it,\" Verkan Vall said as the story clarified.\n\n\"Yes. In somewhat oversimplified form, the situation is rather like\nthis,\" Dr. Harnosh of Hosh said. \"The Lady Dallona introduced a number\nof refinements and some outright innovations into our technique of\nrecovering memories of past reincarnations. Previously, it was\nnecessary to keep the subject in an hypnotic trance, during which he\nor she would narrate what was remembered of past reincarnations, and\nthis would be recorded. On emerging from the trance, the subject would\nremember nothing; the tape-recording would be all that would be left.\nBut the Lady Dallona devised a technique by which these memories would\nremain in what might be called the fore part of the subject's\nsubconscious mind, so that they could be brought to the level of\nconsciousness at will. More, she was able to recover memories of past\ndiscarnate existences, something we had never been able to do\nheretofore.\" Dr. Harnosh shook his head. \"And to think, when I first\nmet her, I thought that she was just another sensation-seeking young\nlady of wealth, and was almost about to refuse her enrollment!\"\n\nHe wasn't the only one whom little Dalla had surprised, Verkan Vall\nthought. At least, he had been pleasantly surprised.\n\n\"You see, this entirely disproves the Statistical Theory of\nReincarnation. For example, we got a fine set of memory-recalls from one\nsubject, for four previous reincarnations and four intercarnations. In\nthe first of these, the subject had been a peasant on the estate of a\nwealthy noble. Unlike most of his fellows, who reincarnated into other\npeasant families almost immediately after discarnation, this man waited\nfor fifty years in the discarnate state for an opportunity to\nreincarnate as the son of an over-servant. In his next reincarnation, he\nwas the son of a technician, and received a technical education; he\nbecame a physics researcher. For his next reincarnation, he chose the\nson of a nobleman by a concubine as his vehicle; in his present\nreincarnation, he is a member of a wealthy manufacturing family, and\nmarried into a family of the nobility. In five reincarnations, he has\nclimbed from the lowest to the next-to-highest rung of the social\nladder. Few individuals of the class from whence he began this ascent\npossess so much persistence or determination. Then, of course, there was\nthe case of Lord Garnon of Roxor.\"\n\nHe went on to describe the last experiment in which Hadron Dalla had\nparticipated.\n\n\"Well, that all sounds pretty conclusive,\" Verkan Vall commented. \"I\ntake it the leaders of the Volitionalist Party here are pleased with\nthe result of the Lady Dallona's work?\"\n\n\"Pleased? My dear Lord Virzal, they're fairly bursting with glee over\nit!\" Harnosh of Hosh declared. \"As I pointed out, the Statisticalist\nprogram of socialization is based entirely on the proposition that no\none can choose the circumstances of his next reincarnation, and that's\nbeen demonstrated to be utter nonsense. Until the Lady Dallona's\ndiscoveries were announced, they were the dominant party, controlling\na majority of the seats in Parliament and on the Executive Council.\nOnly the Constitution kept them from enacting their entire\nsocialization program long ago, and they were about to legislate\nconstitutional changes which would remove that barrier. They had\nexpected to be able to do so after the forthcoming general elections.\nBut now, social inequality has become desirable: it gives people\nsomething to look forward to in the next reincarnation. Instead of\nwanting to abolish wealth and privilege and nobility, the proletariat\nwant to reincarnate into them.\" Harnosh of Hosh laughed happily. \"So\nyou can see how furious the Statisticalist Party organization is!\"\n\n\"There's a catch to this, somewhere,\" Marnik the Assassin, speaking\nfor the first time, declared. \"They can't all reincarnate as princes,\nthere aren't enough vacancies to go 'round. And no noble is going to\nreincarnate as a tractor driver to make room for a tractor driver who\nwants to reincarnate as a noble.\"\n\n\"That's correct,\" Dr. Harnosh replied. \"There is a catch to it; a\ncatch most people would never admit, even to themselves. Very few\nindividuals possess the will power, the intelligence or the capacity\nfor mental effort displayed by the subject of the case I just quoted.\nThe average man's interests are almost entirely on the physical side;\nhe actually finds mental effort painful, and makes as little of it as\npossible. And that is the only sort of effort a discarnate\nindividuality can exert. So, unable to endure the fifty or so years\nneeded to make a really good reincarnation, he reincarnates in a year\nor so, out of pure boredom, into the first vehicle he can find,\nusually one nobody else wants.\" Dr. Harnosh dug out the heel of his\npipe and blew through the stem. \"But nobody will admit his own mental\ninferiority, even to himself. Now, every machine operator and field\nhand on the planet thinks he can reincarnate as a prince or a\nmillionaire. Politics isn't my subject, but I'm willing to bet that\nsince Statistical Reincarnation is an exploded psychic theory,\nStatisticalist Socialism has been caught in the blast area and\ndestroyed along with it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOlirzon was in the drawing room of the hotel suite when they returned,\nsitting on the middle of his spinal column in a reclining chair,\nsmoking a pipe, dressing the edge of his knife with a pocket-hone, and\ngazing lecherously at a young woman in the visiplate. She was an\nextremely well-designed young woman, in a rather fragmentary costume,\nand she was heaving her bosom at the invisible audience in anger,\nsorrow, scorn, entreaty, and numerous other emotions.\n\n\"... this revolting crime,\" she was declaiming, in a husky contralto,\nas Verkan Vall and Marnik entered, \"foul even for the criminal beasts\nwho conceived and perpetrated it!\" She pointed an accusing finger.\n\"This murder of the beautiful Lady Dallona of Hadron!\"\n\nVerkan Vall stopped short, considering the possibility of something\nhaving been discovered lately of which he was ignorant. Olirzon must\nhave guessed his thought; he grinned reassuringly.\n\n\"Think nothing of it, Lord Virzal,\" he said, waving his knife at the\nvisiplate. \"Just political propaganda; strictly for the sparrows. Nice\npropagandist, though.\"\n\n\"And now,\" the woman with the magnificent natural resources lowered\nher voice reverently, \"we bring you the last image of the Lady\nDallona, and of Dirzed, her faithful Assassin, taken just before they\nvanished, never to be seen again.\"\n\nThe plate darkened, and there were strains of slow, dirgelike music;\nthen it lighted again, presenting a view of a broad hallway, thronged\nwith men and women in bright varicolored costumes. In the foreground,\nwearing a tight skirt of deep blue and a short red jacket, was Hadron\nDalla, just as she had looked in the solidographs taken in Dhergabar\nafter her alteration by the First Level cosmeticians to conform to the\nappearance of the Malayoid Akor-Neb people. She was holding the arm of\na man who wore the black tunic and red badge of an Assassin, a\nhandsome specimen of the Akor-Neb race. Trust little Dalla for that,\nVerkan Vall thought. The figures were moving with exaggerated\nslowness, as though a very fleeting picture were being stretched out\nas far as possible. Having already memorized his former wife's changed\nappearance, Verkan Vall concentrated on the man beside her until the\npicture faded.\n\n\"All right, Olirzon; what did you get?\" he asked.\n\n\"Well, first of all, at Assassins' Hall,\" Olirzon said, rolling up his\nleft sleeve, holding his bare forearm to the light, and shaving a few\nfine hairs from it to test the edge of his knife. \"Of course, they\nnever tell one Assassin anything about the client of another Assassin;\nthat's standard practice. But I was in the Lodge Secretary's office,\nwhere nobody but Assassins are ever admitted. They have a big panel in\nthere, with the names of all the Lodge members on it in light-letters;\nthat's standard in all Lodges. If an Assassin is unattached and free\nto accept a client, his name's in white light. If he has a client, the\nlight's changed to blue, and the name of the client goes up under his.\nIf his whereabouts are unknown, the light's changed to amber. If he is\ndiscarnated, his name's removed entirely, unless the circumstances of\nhis discarnation are such as to constitute an injury to the Society.\nIn that case, the name's in red light until he's been properly\navenged, or, as we say, till his blood's been mopped up. Well, the\nname of Dirzed is up in blue light, with the name of Dallona of Hadron\nunder it. I found out that the light had been amber for two days after\nthe disappearance, and then had been changed back to blue. Get it,\nLord Virzal?\"\n\nVerkan Vall nodded. \"I think so. I'd been considering that as a\npossibility from the first. Then what?\"\n\n\"Then I was about and around for a couple of hours, buying drinks for\npeople--unattached Assassins, Constabulary detectives, political\nworkers, newscast people. You owe me fifteen System Monetary Units for\nthat, Lord Virzal. What I got, when it's all sorted out--I taped it in\ndetail, as soon as I got back--reduces to this: The Volitionalists are\nmoving mountains to find out who was the spy at Garnon of Roxor's\ndiscarnation feast, but are doing nothing but nothing at all to find\nthe Lady Dallona or Dirzed. The Statisticalists are making all sorts\nof secret efforts to find out what happened to her. The Constabulary\nblame the Statistos for the package-bomb: they're interested in that\nbecause of the discarnation of the three servants by an illegal weapon\nof indiscriminate effect. They claim that the disappearance of Dirzed\nand the Lady Dallona was a publicity hoax. The Volitionalists are\npreparing a line of publicity to deny this.\"\n\nVerkan Vall nodded. \"That ties in with what you learned at Assassins'\nHall,\" he said. \"They're hiding out somewhere. Is there any chance of\nreaching Dirzed through the Society of Assassins?\"\n\nOlirzon shook his head. \"If you're right--and that's the way it looks\nto me, too--he's probably just called in and notified the Society that\nhe's still carnate and so is the Lady Dallona, and called off any\nsearch the Society might be making for him.\"\n\n\"And I've got to find the Lady Dallona as soon as I can. Well, if I\ncan't reach her, maybe I can get her to send word to me,\" Verkan Vall\nsaid. \"That's going to take some doing, too.\"\n\n\"What did you find out, Lord Virzal?\" Olirzon asked. He had a piece of\nsoft leather, now, and was polishing his blade lovingly.\n\n\"The Reincarnation Research people don't know anything,\" Verkan Vall\nreplied. \"Dr. Harnosh of Hosh thinks she's discarnate. I did find out\nthat the experimental work she's done, so far, has absolutely\ndisproved the theory of Statistical Reincarnation. The Volitionalists'\ntheory is solidly established.\"\n\n\"Yes, what do you think, Olirzon?\" Marnik added. \"They have a case on\nrecord of a man who worked up from field hand to millionaire in five\nreincarnations. Deliberately, that is.\" He went on to repeat what\nHarnosh of Hosh had said; he must have possessed an almost eidetic\nmemory, for he gave the bearded psychicist's words verbatim, and threw\nin the gestures and voice-inflections.\n\nOlirzon grinned. \"You know, there's a chance for the easy-money boys,\"\nhe considered. \"'You, too, can Reincarnate as a millionaire! Let Dr.\nNirzutz of Futzbutz Help You! Only 49.98 System Monetary Units for the\nSecret, Infallible, Autosuggestive Formula.' And would it sell!\" He\nput away the hone and the bit of leather and slipped his knife back\ninto its sheath. \"If I weren't a respectable Assassin, I'd give it a\ntry, myself.\"\n\nVerkan Vall looked at his watch. \"We'd better get something to eat,\"\nhe said. \"We'll go down to the main dining room; the Martian Room, I\nthink they call it. I've got to think of some way to let the Lady\nDallona know I'm looking for her.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Martian Room, fifteen stories down, was a big place, occupying\nalmost half of the floor space of one corner tower. It had been fitted\nto resemble one of the ruined buildings of the ancient and vanished\nrace of Mars who were the ancestors of Terran humanity. One whole side\nof the room was a gigantic cine-solidograph screen, on which the\ngullied desolation of a Martian landscape was projected; in the course\nof about two hours, the scene changed from sunrise through daylight\nand night to sunrise again.\n\nIt was high noon when they entered and found a table; by the time they\nhad finished their dinner, the night was ending and the first glow of\ndawn was tinting the distant hills. They sat for a while, watching the\nlight grow stronger, then got up and left the table.\n\nThere were five men at a table near them; they had come in before the\nstars had grown dim, and the waiters were just bringing their first\ndishes. Two were Assassins, and the other three were of a breed Verkan\nVall had learned to recognize on any time-line--the arrogant,\ncocksure, ambitious, leftist politician, who knows what is best for\neverybody better than anybody else does, and who is convinced that he\nis inescapably right and that whoever differs with him is not only an\nignoramus but a venal scoundrel as well. One was a beefy man in a\ngold-laced cream-colored dress tunic; he had thick lips and a\ntoo-ready laugh. Another was a rather monkish-looking young man who\nspoke earnestly and rolled his eyes upward, as though at some\ncelestial vision. The third had the faint powdering of gray in his\nblack hair which was, among the Akor-Neb people, almost the only\nindication of advanced age.\n\n\"Of course it is; the whole thing is a fraud,\" the monkish young man\nwas saying angrily. \"But we can't prove it.\"\n\n\"Oh, Sirzob, here, can prove anything, if you give him time,\" the\nbeefy one laughed. \"The trouble is, there isn't too much time. We know\nthat that communication was a fake, prearranged by the Volitionalists,\nwith Dr. Harnosh and this Dallona of Hadron as their tools. They fed\nthe whole thing to that idiot boy hypnotically, in advance, and then,\non a signal, he began typing out this spurious communication. And\nthen, of course, Dallona and this Assassin of hers ran off somewhere\ntogether, so that we'd be blamed with discarnating or abducting them,\nand so that they wouldn't be made to testify about the communication\non a lie detector.\"\n\nA sudden happy smile touched Verkan Vall's eyes. He caught each of his\nAssassins by an arm.\n\n\"Marnik, cover my back,\" he ordered. \"Olirzon, cover everybody at the\ntable. Come on!\"\n\nThen he stepped forward, halting between the chairs of the young man\nand the man with the gray hair and facing the beefy man in the light\ntunic.\n\n\"You!\" he barked. \"I mean YOU.\"\n\nThe beefy man stopped laughing and stared at him; then sprang to his\nfeet. His hand, streaking toward his left armpit, stopped and dropped\nto his side as Olirzon aimed a pistol at him. The others sat\nmotionless.\n\n\"You,\" Verkan Vall continued, \"are a complete, deliberate, malicious,\nand unmitigated liar. The Lady Dallona of Hadron is a scientist of\nintegrity, incapable of falsifying her experimental work. What's more,\nher father is one of my best friends; in his name, and in hers, I\ndemand a full retraction of the slanderous statements you have just\nmade.\"\n\n\"Do you know who I am?\" the beefy one shouted.\n\n\"I know _what_ you are,\" Verkan Vall shouted back. Like most ancient\nlanguages, the Akor-Neb speech included an elaborate, delicately-shaded,\nand utterly vile vocabulary of abuse; Verkan Vall culled from it\njudiciously and at length. \"And if I don't make myself understood verbally,\nwe'll go down to the object level,\" he added, snatching a bowl of soup from\nin front of the monkish-looking young man and throwing it across the table.\n\nThe soup was a dark brown, almost black. It contained bits of meat,\nand mushrooms, and slices of hard-boiled egg, and yellow Martian rock\nlichen. It produced, on the light tunic, a most spectacular effect.\n\nFor a moment, Verkan Vall was afraid the fellow would have an\napoplectic stroke, or an epileptic fit. Mastering himself, however, he\nbowed jerkily.\n\n\"Marnark of Bashad,\" he identified himself. \"When and where can my\nfriends consult yours?\"\n\n\"Lord Virzal of Verkan,\" the paratimer bowed back. \"Your friends can\nnegotiate with mine here and now. I am represented by these\nGentlemen-Assassins.\"\n\n\"I won't submit my friends to the indignity of negotiating with them,\"\nMarnark retorted. \"I insist that you be represented by persons of your\nown quality and mine.\"\n\n\"Oh, you do?\" Olirzon broke in. \"Well, is your objection personal to\nme, or to Assassins as a class? In the first case, I'll remember to\nmake a private project of you, as soon as I'm through with my present\nemployment; if it's the latter, I'll report your attitude to the\nSociety. I'll see what Klarnood, our President-General, thinks of your\nviews.\"\n\nA crowd had begun to accumulate around the table. Some of them were\npersons in evening dress, some were Assassins on the hotel payroll,\nand some were unattached Assassins.\n\n\"Well, you won't have far to look for him,\" one of the latter said,\npushing through the crowd to the table.\n\nHe was a man of middle age, inclined to stoutness; he made Verkan Vall\nthink of a chocolate figure of Tortha Karf. The red badge on his\nbreast was surrounded with gold lace, and, instead of black wings and\na silver bullet, it bore silver wings and a golden dagger. He bowed\ncontemptuously at Marnark of Bashad.\n\n\"Klarnood, President-General of the Society of Assassins,\" he\nannounced. \"Marnark of Bashad, did I hear you say that you considered\nmembers of the Society as unworthy to negotiate an affair of honor\nwith your friends, on behalf of this nobleman who has been courteous\nenough to accept your challenge?\" he demanded.\n\nMarnark of Bashad's arrogance suffered considerable evaporation-loss.\nHis tone became almost servile.\n\n\"Not at all, Honorable Assassin-President,\" he protested. \"But as I\nwas going to ask these gentlemen to represent me, I thought it would\nbe more fitting for the other gentleman to be represented by personal\nfriends, also. In that way--\"\n\n\"Sorry, Marnark,\" the gray-haired man at the table said. \"I can't\nsecond you; I have a quarrel with the Lord Virzal, too.\" He rose and\nbowed. \"Sirzob of Abo. Inasmuch as the Honorable Marnark is a guest at\nmy table, an affront to him is an affront to me. In my quality as his\nhost, I must demand satisfaction from you, Lord Virzal.\"\n\n\"Why, gladly, Honorable Sirzob,\" Verkan Vall replied. This was getting\nbetter and better every moment. \"Of course, your friend, the Honorable\nMarnark, enjoys priority of challenge; I'll take care of you as soon\nas I have, shall we say, satisfied, him.\"\n\nThe earnest and rather consecrated-looking young man rose also, bowing\nto Verkan Vall.\n\n\"Yirzol of Narva. I, too, have a quarrel with you, Lord Virzal; I\ncannot submit to the indignity of having my food snatched from in\nfront of me, as you just did. I also demand satisfaction.\"\n\n\"And quite rightly, Honorable Yirzol,\" Verkan Vall approved. \"It looks\nlike such good soup, too,\" he sorrowed, inspecting the front of\nMarnark's tunic. \"My seconds will negotiate with yours immediately;\nyour satisfaction, of course, must come after that of Honorable\nSirzob.\"\n\n\"If I may intrude,\" Klarnood put in smoothly, \"may I suggest that as\nthe Lord Virzal is represented by his Assassins, yours can represent\nall three of you at the same time. I will gladly offer my own good\noffices as impartial supervisor.\"\n\nVerkan Vall turned and bowed as to royalty. \"An honor,\nAssassin-President: I am sure no one could act in that capacity more\nsatisfactorily.\"\n\n\"Well, when would it be most convenient to arrange the details?\"\nKlarnood inquired. \"I am completely at your disposal, gentlemen.\"\n\n\"Why, here and now, while we're all together,\" Verkan Vall replied.\n\n\"I object to that!\" Marnark of Bashad vociferated. \"We can't make\narrangements here; why, all these hotel people, from the manager down,\nare nothing but tipsters for the newscast services!\"\n\n\"Well, what's wrong with that?\" Verkan Vall demanded. \"You knew that\nwhen you slandered the Lady Dallona in their hearing.\"\n\n\"The Lord Virzal of Verkan is correct,\" Klarnood ruled. \"And the\noffenses for which you have challenged him were also committed in\npublic. By all means, let's discuss the arrangements now.\" He turned\nto Verkan Vall. \"As the challenged party, you have the choice of\nweapons; your opponents, then, have the right to name the conditions\nunder which they are to be used.\"\n\nMarnark of Bashad raised another outcry over that. The assault upon\nhim by the Lord Virzal of Verkan was deliberately provocative, and\ntherefore tantamount to a challenge; he, himself, had the right to\nname the weapons. Klarnood upheld him.\n\n\"Do the other gentlemen make the same claim?\" Verkan Vall wanted to\nknow.\n\n\"If they do, I won't allow it,\" Klarnood replied. \"You deliberately\nprovoked Honorable Marnark, but the offenses of provoking him at\nHonorable Sirzob's table, and of throwing Honorable Yirzol's soup at\nhim, were not given with intent to provoke. These gentlemen have a\nright to challenge, but not to consider themselves provoked.\"\n\n\"Well, I choose knives, then,\" Marnark hastened to say.\n\nVerkan Vall smiled thinly. He had learned knife-play among the\ngreatest masters of that art in all paratime, the Third Level Khanga\npirates of the Caribbean Islands.\n\n\"And we fight barefoot, stripped to the waist, and without any\nparrying weapon in the left hand,\" Verkan Vall stipulated.\n\nThe beefy Marnark fairly licked his chops in anticipation. He\noutweighed Verkan Vall by forty pounds; he saw an easy victory ahead.\nVerkan Vall's own confidence increased at these signs of his\nopponent's assurance.\n\n\"And as for Honorable Sirzob and Honorable Yirzol, I chose pistols,\"\nhe added.\n\nSirzob and Yirzol held a hasty whispered conference.\n\n\"Speaking both for Honorable Yirzol and for myself,\" Sirzob announced,\n\"we stipulate that the distance shall be twenty meters, that the\npistols shall be fully loaded, and that fire shall be at will after\nthe command.\"\n\n\"Twenty rounds, fire at will, at twenty meters!\" Olirzon hooted. \"You\nmust think our principal's as bad a shot as you are!\"\n\nThe four Assassins stepped aside and held a long discussion about\nsomething, with considerable argument and gesticulation. Klarnood,\nobserving Verkan Vall's impatience, leaned close to him and whispered:\n\n\"This is highly irregular; we must pretend ignorance and be patient.\nThey're laying bets on the outcome. You must do your best, Lord\nVirzal; you don't want your supporters to lose money.\"\n\nHe said it quite seriously, as though the outcome were otherwise a\nmatter of indifference to Verkan Vall.\n\nMarnark wanted to discuss time and place, and proposed that all three\nduels be fought at dawn, on the fourth landing stage of Darsh Central\nHospital; that was closest to the maternity wards, and statistics\nshowed that most births occurred just before that hour.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" Verkan Vall vetoed. \"We'll fight here and now; I\ndon't propose going a couple of hundred miles to meet you at any such\nunholy hour. We'll fight in the nearest hallway that provides twenty\nmeters' shooting distance.\"\n\nMarnark, Sirzob and Yirzol all clamored in protest. Verkan Vall\nshouted them down, drawing on his hypnotically acquired knowledge of\nAkor-Neb duelling customs. \"The code explicitly states that\nsatisfaction shall be rendered as promptly as possible, and I insist\non a literal interpretation. I'm not going to inconvenience myself and\nAssassin-President Klarnood and these four Gentlemen-Assassins just to\nhumor Statisticalist superstitions.\"\n\nThe manager of the hotel, drawn to the Martian Room by the uproar,\noffered a hallway connecting the kitchens with the refrigerator rooms;\nit was fifty meters long by five in width, was well-lighted and\nsoundproof, and had a bay in which the seconds and other could stand\nduring the firing.\n\nThey repaired thither in a body, Klarnood gathering up several hotel\nservants on the way through the kitchen. Verkan Vall stripped to the\nwaist, pulled off his ankle boots, and examined Olirzon's knife. Its\ntapering eight-inch blade was double-edged at the point, and its\nhandle was covered with black velvet to afford a good grip, and wound\nwith gold wire. He nodded approvingly, gripped it with his index\nfinger crooked around the cross-guard, and advanced to meet Marnark of\nBashad.\n\nAs he had expected, the burly politician was depending upon his\ngreater brawn to overpower his antagonist. He advanced with a sidling,\nspread-legged gait, his knife hand against his right hip and his left\nhand extended in front. Verkan Vall nodded with pleased satisfaction;\na wrist-grabber. Then he blinked. Why, the fellow was actually holding\nhis knife reversed, his little finger to the guard and his thumb on\nthe pommel!\n\nVerkan Vall went briskly to meet him, made a feint at his knife hand\nwith his own left, and then side-stepped quickly to the right. As\nMarnark's left hand grabbed at his right wrist, his left hand brushed\nagainst it and closed into a fist, with Marnark's left thumb inside of\nit, He gave a quick downward twist with his wrist, pulling Marnark off\nbalance.\n\nCaught by surprise, Marnark stumbled, his knife flailing wildly away\nfrom Verkan Vall. As he stumbled forward, Verkan Vall pivoted on his\nleft heel and drove the point of his knife into the back of Marnark's\nneck, twisting it as he jerked it free. At the same time, he released\nMarnark's thumb. The politician continued his stumble and fell forward\non his face, blood spurting from his neck. He gave a twitch or so, and\nwas still.\n\nVerkan Vall stooped and wiped the knife on the dead man's\nclothes--another Khanga pirate gesture--and then returned it to\nOlirzon.\n\n\"Nice weapon, Olirzon,\" he said. \"It fitted my hand as though I'd been\nborn holding it.\"\n\n\"You used it as though you had, Lord Virzal,\" the Assassin replied.\n\"Only eight seconds from the time you closed with him.\"\n\n[Illustration: ]\n\nThe function of the hotel servants whom Klarnood had gathered up now\nbecame apparent; they advanced, took the body of Marnark by the\nheels, and dragged it out of the way. The others watched this removal\nwith mixed emotions. The two remaining principals were impassive and\nfrozen-faced. Their two Assassins, who had probably bet heavily on\nMarnark, were chagrined. And Klarnood was looking at Verkan Vall with\na considerable accretion of respect. Verkan Vall pulled on his boots\nand resumed his clothing.\n\nThere followed some argument about the pistols; it was finally decided\nthat each combatant should use his own shoulder-holster weapon. All\nthree were nearly enough alike--small weapons, rather heavier than\nthey looked, firing a tiny ten-grain bullet at ten thousand\nfoot-seconds. On impact, such a bullet would almost disintegrate; a\nman hit anywhere in the body with one would be killed instantly, his\nnervous system paralyzed and his heart stopped by internal pressure.\nEach of the pistols carried twenty rounds in the magazine.\n\nVerkan Vall and Sirzob of Abo took their places, their pistols lowered\nat their sides, facing each other across a measured twenty meters.\n\n\"Are you ready, gentlemen?\" Klarnood asked. \"You will not raise your\npistols until the command to fire; you may fire at will after it.\nReady. _Fire!_\"\n\n[Illustration: ]\n\nBoth pistols swung up to level. Verkan Vall found Sirzob's head in his\nsights and squeezed; the pistol kicked back in his hand, and he saw a\nlance of blue flame jump from the muzzle of Sirzob's. Both weapons\nbarked together, and with the double report came the whip-cracking\nsound of Sirzob's bullet passing Verkan Vall's head. Then Sirzob's\nface altered its appearance unpleasantly, and he pitched forward.\nVerkan Vall thumbed on his safety and stood motionless, while the\nservants advanced, took Sirzob's body by the heels, and dragged it\nover beside Marnark's.\n\n\"All right; Honorable Yirzol, you're next,\" Verkan Vall called out.\n\n\"The Lord Virzal has fired one shot,\" one of the opposing seconds\nobjected, \"and Honorable Yirzol has a full magazine. The Lord Virzal\nshould put in another magazine.\"\n\n\"I grant him the advantage; let's get on with it,\" Verkan Vall said.\n\nYirzol of Narva advanced to the firing point. He was not afraid of\ndeath--none of the Akor-Neb people were; their language contained no\nword to express the concept of total and final extinction--and\ndiscarnation by gunshot was almost entirely painless. But he was\nbeginning to suspect that he had made a fool of himself by getting\ninto this affair, he had work in his present reincarnation which he\nwanted to finish, and his political party would suffer loss, both of\nhis services and of prestige.\n\n\"Are you ready, gentlemen?\" Klarnood intoned ritualistically. \"You\nwill not raise your pistols until the command to fire; you may fire at\nwill after it. Ready, _Fire!_\"\n\nVerkan Vall shot Yirzol of Narva through the head before the latter\nhad his pistol half raised. Yirzol fell forward on the splash of blood\nSirzob had made, and the servants came forward and dragged his body\nover with the others. It reminded Verkan Vail of some sort of\nindustrial assembly-line operation. He replaced the two expended\nrounds in his magazine with fresh ones and slid the pistol back into\nits holster. The two Assassins whose principals had been so\nexpeditiously massacred were beginning to count up their losses and\npay off the winners.\n\nKlarnood, the President-General of the Society of Assassins, came\nover, hooking fingers and clapping shoulders with Verkan Vall.\n\n\"Lord Virzal, I've seen quite a few duels, but nothing quite like\nthat,\" he said. \"You should have been an Assassin!\"\n\nThat was a considerable compliment. Verkan Vall thanked him modestly.\n\n\"I'd like to talk to you privately,\" the Assassin-President continued.\n\"I think it'll be worth your while if we have a few words together.\"\n\nVerkan Vall nodded. \"My suite is on the fifteenth floor above; will\nthat be all right?\" He waited until the losers had finished settling\ntheir bets, then motioned to his own pair of Assassins.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs they emerged into the Martian Room again, the manager was waiting;\nhe looked as though he were about to demand that Verkan Vall vacate\nhis suite. However, when he saw the arm of the President-General of\nthe Society of Assassins draped amicably over his guest's shoulder, he\ncame forward bowing and smiling.\n\n\"Larnorm, I want you to put five of your best Assassins to guarding\nthe approaches to the Lord Virzal's suite,\" Klarnood told him. \"I'll\nsend five more from Assassins' Hall to replace them at their ordinary\nduties. And I'll hold you responsible with your carnate existence for\nthe Lord Virzal's safety in this hotel. Understand?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, Honorable Assassin-President; you may trust me. The Lord\nVirzal will be perfectly safe.\"\n\nIn Verkan Vall's suite, above, Klarnood sat down and got out his pipe,\nfilling it with tobacco lightly mixed with _zerfa_. To his surprise,\nhe saw his host light a plain tobacco cigarette.\n\n\"Don't you use _zerfa_?\" he asked.\n\n\"Very little,\" Verkan Vall replied. \"I grow it. If you'd see the bums\nwho hang around our drying sheds, on Venus, cadging rejected leaves\nand smoking themselves into a stupor, you'd be frugal in using it,\ntoo.\"\n\nKlarnood nodded. \"You know, most men would want a pipe of fifty\npercent, or a straight _zerfa_ cigarette, after what you've been\nthrough,\" he said.\n\n\"I'd need something like that, to deaden my conscience, if I had one\nto deaden,\" Verkan Vall said. \"As it is, I feel like a murderer of\nbabes. That overgrown fool, Marnark, handled his knife like a\ncow-butcher. The young fellow couldn't handle a pistol at all. I\nsuppose the old fellow, Sirzob, was a fair shot, but dropping him\nwasn't any great feat of arms, either.\"\n\nKlarnood looked at him curiously for a moment. \"You know,\" he said, at\nlength, \"I believe you actually mean that. Well, until he met you,\nMarnark of Bashad was rated as the best knife-fighter in Darsh. Sirzob\nhad ten dueling victories to his credit, and young Yirzol four.\" He\npuffed slowly on his pipe. \"I like you, Lord Virzal; a great Assassin\nwas lost when you decided to reincarnate as a Venusian land-owner. I'd\nhate to see you discarnated without proper warning. I take it you're\nignorant of the intricacies of Terran politics?\"\n\n\"To a large extent, yes.\"\n\n\"Well, do you know who those three men were?\" When Verkan Vall shook\nhis head, Klarnood continued: \"Marnark was the son and right-hand\nassociate of old Mirzark of Bashad, the Statisticalist Party leader.\nSirzob of Abo was their propaganda director. And Yirzol of Narva was\ntheir leading socio-economic theorist, and their candidate for\nExecutive Chairman. In six minutes, with one knife thrust and two\nshots, you did the Statisticalist Party an injury second only to that\ndone them by the young lady in whose name you were fighting. In two\nweeks, there will be a planet-wide general election. As it stands, the\nStatisticalists have a majority of the seats in Parliament and on the\nExecutive Council. As a result of your work and the Lady Dallona's,\nthey'll lose that majority, and more, when the votes are tallied.\"\n\n\"Is that another reason why you like me?\" Verkan Vall asked.\n\n\"Unofficially, yes. As President-General of the Society of Assassins,\nI must be nonpolitical. The Society is rigidly so; if we let ourselves\nbecome involved, as an organization, in politics, we could control the\nSystem Government inside of five years, and we'd be wiped out of\nexistence in fifty years by the very forces we sought to control,\"\nKlarnood said. \"But personally, I would like to see the Statisticalist\nParty destroyed. If they succeed in their program of socialization,\nthe Society would be finished. A socialist state is, in its final\ndevelopment, an absolute, total, state; no total state can tolerate\nextra-legal and para-governmental organizations. So we have adopted\nthe policy of giving a little inconspicuous aid, here and there, to\npeople who are dangerous to the Statisticalists. The Lady Dallona of\nHadron, and Dr. Harnosh of Hosh, are such persons. You appear to be\nanother. That's why I ordered that fellow, Larnorm, to make sure you\nwere safe in his hotel.\"\n\n\"Where is the Lady Dallona?\" Verkan Vall asked. \"From your use of the\npresent tense, I assume you believe her to be still carnate.\"\n\nKlarnood looked at Verkan Vall keenly. \"That's a pretty blunt\nquestion, Lord Virzal,\" he said. \"I wish I knew a little more about\nyou. When you and your Assassins started inquiring about the Lady\nDallona, I tried to check up on you. I found out that you had come to\nDarsh from Ghamma on a ship of the family of Zorda, accompanied by\nBrarnend of Zorda himself. And that's all I could find out. You claim\nto be a Venusian planter, and you might be. Any Terran who can handle\nweapons as you can would have come to my notice long ago. But you have\nno more ascertainable history than if you'd stepped out of another\ndimension.\"\n\nThat was getting uncomfortably close to the truth. In fact, it _was_\nthe truth. Verkan Vall laughed.\n\n\"Well, confidentially,\" he said, \"I'm from the Arcturus System. I\nfollowed the Lady Dallona here from our home planet, and when I have\nrescued her from among you Solarians, I shall, according to our\ncustoms, receive her hand in marriage. As she is the daughter of the\nEmperor of Arcturus, that'll be quite a good thing for me.\"\n\nKlarnood chuckled. \"You know, you'd only have to tell me that about\nthree or four times and I'd start believing it,\" he said. \"And Dr.\nHarnosh of Hosh would believe it the first time; he's been talking to\nhimself ever since the Lady Dallona started her experimental work\nhere. Lord Virzal, I'm going to take a chance on you. The Lady Dallona\nis still carnate, or was four days ago, and the same for Dirzed. They\nboth went into hiding after the discarnation feast of Garnon of Roxor,\nto escape the enmity of the Statisticalists. Two days after they\ndisappeared, Dirzed called Assassins' Hall and reported this, but told\nus nothing more. I suppose, in about three or four days, I could\nre-establish contact with him. We want the public to think that the\nStatisticalists made away with the Lady Dallona, at least until the\nelection's over.\"\n\nVerkan Vall nodded. \"I was pretty sure that was the situation,\" he\nsaid. \"It may be that they will get in touch with me; if they don't,\nI'll need your help in reaching them.\"\n\n\"Why do you think the Lady Dallona will try to reach you?\"\n\n\"She needs all the help she can get. She knows she can get plenty from\nme. Why do you think I interrupted my search for her, and risked my\ncarnate existence, to fight those people over a matter of verbalisms\nand political propaganda?\" Verkan Vall went to the newscast visiplate\nand snapped it on. \"We'll see if I'm getting results, yet.\"\n\nThe plate lighted, and a handsome young man in a gold-laced green suit\nwas speaking out of it:\n\n\"... where he is heavily guarded by Assassins. However, in an\nexclusive interview with representatives of this service, the Assassin\nHirzif, one of the two who seconded the men the Lord Virzal fought,\nsaid that in his opinion all of the three were so outclassed as to\nhave had no chance whatever, and that he had already refused an offer\nof ten thousand System Monetary Units to discarnate the Lord Virzal\nfor the Statisticalist Party. 'When I want to discarnate,' Hirzif the\nAssassin said, 'I'll invite in my friends and do it properly; until I\ndo, I wouldn't go up against the Lord Virzal of Verkan for ten million\nS.M.U.'\"\n\nVerkan Vall snapped off the visiplate. \"See what I mean?\" he asked. \"I\nfought those politicians just for the advertising. If Dallona and\nDirzed are anywhere near a visiplate, they'll know how to reach me.\"\n\n\"Hirzif shouldn't have talked about refusing that retainer,\" Klarnood\nfrowned. \"That isn't good Assassin ethics. Why, yes, Lord Virzal; that\nwas cleverly planned. It ought to get results. But I wish you'd get\nthe Lady Dallona out of Darsh, and preferably off Terra, as soon as\nyou can. We've benefited by this, so far, but I shouldn't like to see\nthings go much further. A real civil war could develop out of this\nsituation, and I don't want that. Call on me for help; I'll give you a\ncode word to use at Assassins' Hall.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA real civil war was developing even as Klarnood spoke; by mid-morning\nof the next day, the fighting that had been partially suppressed by\nthe Constabulary had broken out anew. The Assassins employed by the\nSolar Hotel--heavily re-enforced during the night--had fought a\npitched battle with Statisticalist partisans on the landing-stage\nabove Verkan Vall's suite, and now several Constabulary airboats were\npatrolling around the building. The rule on Constabulary interference\nseemed to be that while individuals had an unquestionable right to\nshoot out their differences among themselves, any fighting likely to\nendanger nonparticipants was taboo.\n\nJust how successful in enforcing this rule the Constabulary were was\nopen to some doubt. Ever since arising, Verkan Vall had heard the\ncrash of small arms and the hammering of automatic weapons in other\nparts of the towering city-unit. There hadn't been a civil war on the\nAkor-Neb Sector for over five centuries, he knew, but then, Hadron\nDalla, Doctor of Psychic Science, and intertemporal trouble-carrier\nextraordinary, had only been on this sector for a little under a year.\nIf anything, he was surprised that the explosion had taken so long to\noccur.\n\nOne of the servants furnished to him by the hotel management\napproached him in the drawing room, holding a four-inch-square wafer\nof white plastic.\n\n\"Lord Virzal, there is a masked Assassin in the hallway who brought\nthis under Assassins' Truce,\" he said.\n\nVerkan Vall took the wafer and pared off three of the four edges,\nwhich showed black where they had been fused. Unfolding it, he found,\nas he had expected, that the pyrographed message within was in the\nalphabet and language of the First Paratime Level:\n\n    Vall, darling:\n\n    Am I glad you got here; this time I really _am_ in the\n    middle, but good! The Assassin, Dirzed, who brings this, is\n    in my service. You can trust him implicitly; he's about the\n    only person in Darsh you can trust. He'll bring you to where I\n    am.\n\n                                                        Dalla\n\n    P.S. I hope you're not still angry about that musician. I\n    told you, at the time, that he was just helping me with an\n    experiment in telepathy.\n\n                                                        D.\n\nVerkan Vall grinned at the postscript. That had been twenty years ago,\nwhen he'd been eighty and she'd been seventy. He supposed she'd expect\nhim to take up his old relationship with her again. It probably\nwouldn't last any longer than it had, the other time; he recalled a\nFourth Level proverb about the leopard and his spots. It certainly\nwouldn't be boring, though.\n\n\"Tell the Assassin to come in,\" he directed. Then he tossed the\nmessage down on a table. Outside of himself, nobody in Darsh could\nread it but the woman who had sent it; if, as he thought highly\nprobable, the Statisticalists had spies among the hotel staff, it\nmight serve to reduce some cryptanalyst to gibbering insanity.\n\nThe Assassin entered, drawing off a cowllike mask. He was the man\nwhose arm Dalla had been holding in the visiplate picture; Verkan Vall\neven recognized the extremely ornate pistol and knife on his belt.\n\n\"Dirzed the Assassin,\" he named himself. \"If you wish, we can\nvisiphone Assassins' Hall for verification of my identity.\"\n\n\"Lord Virzal of Verkan. And my Assassins, Marnik and Olirzon.\" They\nall hooked fingers and clapped shoulders with the newcomer. \"That\nwon't be needed,\" Verkan Vall told Dirzed. \"I know you from seeing you\nwith the Lady Dallona, on the visiplate; you're 'Dirzed, her faithful\nAssassin.'\"\n\nDirzed's face, normally the color of a good walnut gunstock, turned\nalmost black. He used shockingly bad language.\n\n\"And that's why I have to wear this abomination,\" he finished,\ndisplaying the mask. \"The Lady Dallona and I can't show our faces\nanywhere; if we did, every Statisticalist and his six-year-old brat\nwould know us, and we'd be fighting off an army of them in five\nminutes.\"\n\n\"Where's the Lady Dallona, now?\"\n\n\"In hiding, Lord Virzal, at a private dwelling dome in the forest;\nshe's most anxious to see you. I'm to take you to her, and I would\nstrongly advise that you bring your Assassins along. There are other\npeople at this dome, and they are not personally loyal to the Lady\nDallona. I've no reason to suspect them of secret enmity, but their\nfriendship is based entirely on political expediency.\"\n\n\"And political expediency is subject to change without notice,\" Verkan\nVall finished for him. \"Have you an airboat?\"\n\n\"On the landing stage below. Shall we go now, Lord Virzal?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Verkan Vall made a two-handed gesture to his Assassins, as\nthough gripping a submachine-gun; they nodded, went into another room,\nand returned carrying light automatic weapons in their hands and\npouches of spare drums slung over their shoulders. \"And may I suggest,\nDirzed, that one of my Assassins drives the airboat? I want you on the\nback seat with me, to explain the situation as we go.\"\n\nDirzed's teeth flashed white against his brown skin as he gave Verkan\nVall a quick smile.\n\n\"By all means, Lord Virzal; I would much rather be distrusted than to\nfind that my client's friends were not discreet.\"\n\nThere were a couple of hotel Assassins guarding Dirzed's airboat, on\nthe landing stage. Marnik climbed in under the controls, with Olirzon\nbeside him; Verkan Vall and Dirzed entered the rear seat. Dirzed gave\nMarnik the co-ordinate reference for their destination.\n\n\"Now, what sort of a place is this, where we're going?\" Verkan Vall\nasked. \"And who's there whom we may or may not trust?\"\n\n\"Well, it's a dome house belonging to the family of Starpha; they own\na five-mile radius around it, oak and beech forest and underbrush,\nstocked with deer and boar. A hunting lodge. Prince Jirzyn of Starpha,\nLord Girzon of Roxor, and a few other top-level Volitionalists, know\nthat the Lady Dallona's hiding there. They're keeping her out of sight\ntill after the election, for propaganda purposes. We've been hiding\nthere since immediately after the discarnation feast of the Lord\nGarnon of Roxor.\"\n\n\"What happened, after the feast?\" Verkan Vall wanted to know.\n\n\"Well, you know how the Lady Dallona and Dr. Harnosh of Hosh had this\ntelepathic-sensitive there, in a trance and drugged with a\n_zerfa_-derivative alkaloid the Lady Dallona had developed. I was Lord\nGarnon's Assassin; I discarnated him, myself. Why, I hadn't even put\nmy pistol away before he was in control of this sensitive, in a room\nfive stories above the banquet hall; he began communicating at once.\nWe had visiplates to show us what was going on.\n\n\"Right away, Nirzav of Shonna, one of the Statisticalist leaders who\nwas a personal friend of Lord Garnon's in spite of his politics,\nrenounced Statisticalism and went over to the Volitionalists, on the\nstrength of this communication. Prince Jirzyn, and Lord Girzon, the\nnew family-head of Roxor, decided that there would be trouble in the\nnext few days, so they advised the Lady Dallona to come to this\nhunting lodge for safety. She and I came here in her airboat, directly\nfrom the feast. A good thing we did, too; if we'd gone to her\napartment, we'd have walked in before that lethal gas had time to\nclear.\n\n\"There are four Assassins of the family of Starpha, and six\nmenservants, and an upper-servant named Tarnod, the gamekeeper. The\nStarpha Assassins and I have been keeping the rest under observation.\nI left one of the Starpha Assassins guarding the Lady Dallona when I\ncame for you, under brotherly oath to protect her in my name till I\nreturned.\"\n\nThe airboat was skimming rapidly above the treetops, toward the\nnorthern part of the city.\n\n\"What's known about that package bomb?\" Verkan Vall asked. \"Who sent\nit?\"\n\nDirzed shrugged. \"The Statisticalists, of course. The wrapper was\nstolen from the Reincarnation Research Institute; so was the case. The\nConstabulary are working on it.\" Dirzed shrugged again.\n\nThe dome, about a hundred and fifty feet in width and some fifty in\nheight, stood among the trees ahead. It was almost invisible from any\ndistance; the concrete dome was of mottled green and gray concrete,\ntrees grew so close as to brush it with their branches, and the little\npavilion on the flattened top was roofed with translucent green\nplastic. As the airboat came in, a couple of men in Assassins' garb\nemerged from the pavilion to meet them.\n\n\"Marnik, stay at the controls,\" Verkan Vall directed. \"I'll send\nOlirzon up for you if I want you. If there's any trouble, take off for\nAssassins' Hall and give the code word, then come back with twice as\nmany men as you think you'll need.\"\n\nDirzed raised his eyebrows over this. \"I hadn't known the\nAssassin-President had given you a code word, Lord Virzal,\" he\ncommented. \"That doesn't happen very often.\"\n\n\"The Assassin-President has honored me with his friendship,\" Verkan\nVall replied noncommittally, as he, Dirzed and Olirzon climbed out of\nthe airboat. Marnik was holding it an unobtrusive inch or so above the\nflat top of the dome, away from the edge of the pavilion roof.\n\nThe two Assassins greeted him, and a man in upper-servants' garb and\nwearing a hunting knife and a long hunting pistol approached.\n\n\"Lord Virzal of Verkan? Welcome to Starpha Dome. The Lady Dallona\nawaits you below.\"\n\nVerkan Vall had never been in an Akor-Neb dwelling dome, but a\ndescription of such structures had been included in his hypno-mech\nindoctrination. Originally, they had been the standard structure for\nall purposes; about two thousand elapsed years ago, when nationalism\nhad still existed on the Akor-Neb Sector, the cities had been almost\nentirely under ground, as protection from air attack. Even now, the\ndesign had been retained by those who wished to live apart from the\ntowering city units, to preserve the natural appearance of the\nlandscape. The Starpha hunting lodge was typical of such domes. Under\nit was a circular well, eighty feet in depth and fifty in width, with\na fountain and a shallow circular pool at the bottom. The storerooms,\nkitchens and servants' quarters were at the top, the living quarters\nat the bottom, in segments of a wide circle around the well, back of\nbalconies.\n\n\"Tarnod, the gamekeeper,\" Dirzed performed the introductions. \"And\nErarno and Kirzol, Assassins.\"\n\nVerkan Vall hooked fingers and clapped shoulders with them. Tarnod\naccompanied them to the lifter tubes--two percent positive gravitation\nfor descent and two percent negative for ascent--and they all floated\ndown the former, like air-filled balloons, to the bottom level.\n\n\"The Lady Dallona is in the gun room,\" Tarnod informed Verkan Vall,\nmaking as though to guide him.\n\n\"Thanks, Tarnod; we know the way,\" Dirzed told him shortly, turning\nhis back on the upper-servant and walking toward a closed door on the\nother side of the fountain. Verkan Vall and Olirzon followed; for a\nmoment, Tarnod stood looking after them, then he followed the other\ntwo Assassins into the ascent tube.\n\n\"I don't relish that fellow,\" Dirzed explained. \"The family of Starpha\nuse him for work they couldn't hire an Assassin to do at any price.\nI've been here often, when I was with the Lord Garnon; I've always\nthought he had something on Prince Jirzyn.\"\n\nHe knocked sharply on the closed door with the butt of his pistol. In\na moment, it slid open, and a young Assassin with a narrow mustache\nand a tuft of chin beard looked out.\n\n\"Ah, Dirzed.\" He stepped outside. \"The Lady Dallona is within; I\nreturn her to your care.\"\n\nVerkan Vall entered, followed by Dirzed and Olirzon. The big room was\nfitted with reclining chairs and couches and low tables; its walls\nwere hung with the heads of deer and boar and wolves, and with racks\nholding rifles and hunting pistols and fowling pieces. It was filled\nwith the soft glow of indirect cold light. At the far side of the\nroom, a young woman was seated at a desk, speaking softly into a sound\ntranscriber. As they entered, she snapped it off and rose.\n\nHadron Dalla wore the same costume Verkan Vall had seen on the\nvisiplate: he recognized her instantly. It took her a second or two to\nperceive Verkan Vall under the brown skin and black hair of the Lord\nVirzal of Verkan. Then her face lighted with a happy smile.\n\n\"Why, Va-a-a-ll!\" she whooped, running across the room and tossing\nherself into his not particularly reluctant arms. After all, it had\nbeen twenty years--\"I didn't know you, at first!\"\n\n\"You mean, in these clothes?\" he asked, seeing that she had forgotten,\nfor the moment, the presence of the two Assassins. She had even\ncalled him by his First Level name, but that was unimportant--the\nAkor-Neb affectionate diminutive was formed by omitting the -_irz_- or\n-_arn_-. \"Well, they're not exactly what I generally wear on the\nplantation.\" He kissed her again, then turned to his companions. \"Your\npardon, Gentlemen-Assassins; it's been something over a year since\nwe've seen each other.\"\n\nOlirzon was smiling at the affectionate reunion; Dirzed wore a look of\namused resignation, as though he might have expected something like\nthis to happen. Verkan Vall and Dalla sat down on a couch near the\ndesk.\n\n\"That was really sweet of you, Vall, fighting those men for talking\nabout me,\" she began. \"You took an awful chance, though. But if you\nhadn't, I'd never have known you were in Darsh--Oh-oh! That was why\nyou did it, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Well, I had to do something. Everybody either didn't know or weren't\nsaying where you were. I assumed, from the circumstances, that you\nwere hiding somewhere. Tell me, Dalla; do you really have scientific\nproof of reincarnation? I mean, as an established fact?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; these people on this sector have had that for over ten\ncenturies. They have hypnotic techniques for getting back into a part\nof the subconscious mind that we've never been able to reach. And\nafter I found out how they did it, I was able to adapt some of our\nhypno-epistemological techniques to it, and--\"\n\n\"All right; that's what I wanted to know,\" he cut her off. \"We're\ngetting out of here, right away.\"\n\n\"But where?\"\n\n\"Ghamma, in an airboat I have outside, and then back to the First\nLevel. Unless there's a paratime-transposition conveyor somewhere\nnearer.\"\n\n\"But why, Vall? I'm not ready to go back; I have a lot of work to do here,\nyet. They're getting ready to set up a series of control-experiments at the\nInstitute, and then, I'm in the middle of an experiment, a\ntwo-hundred-subject memory-recall experiment. See, I distributed two\nhundred sets of equipment for my new technique--injection-ampoules of this\n_zerfa_-derivative drug, and sound records of the hypnotic suggestion\nformula, which can be played on an ordinary reproducer. It's just a crude\nvariant of our hypno-mech process, except that instead of implanting\ninformation in the subconscious mind, to be brought at will to the level of\nconsciousness, it works the other way, and draws into conscious knowledge\ninformation already in the subconscious mind. The way these people have\nalways done has been to put the subject in an hypnotic trance and then\nrecord verbal statements made in the trance state; when the subject comes\nout of the trance, the record is all there is, because the memories of past\nreincarnations have never been in the conscious mind. But with my process,\nthe subject can consciously remember everything about his last\nreincarnation, and as many reincarnations before that as he wishes to. I\nhaven't heard from any of the people who received these auto-recall kits,\nand I really must--\"\n\n\"Dalla, I don't want to have to pull Paratime Police authority on you,\nbut, so help me, if you don't come back voluntarily with me, I will.\nSecurity of the secret of paratime transposition.\"\n\n\"Oh, my eye!\" Dalla exclaimed. \"Don't give me that, Vall!\"\n\n\"Look, Dalla. Suppose you get discarnated here,\" Verkan Vall said.\n\"You say reincarnation is a scientific fact. Well, you'd reincarnate\non this sector, and then you'd take a memory-recall, under hypnosis.\nAnd when you did, the paratime secret wouldn't be a secret any more.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Dalla's hand went to her mouth in consternation. Like every\nparatimer, she was conditioned to shrink with all her being from the\nmere thought of revealing to any out-time dweller the secret ability\nof her race to pass to other time-lines, or even the existence of\nalternate lines of probability. \"And if I took one of the\nold-fashioned trance-recalls, I'd blat out everything; I wouldn't be\nable to keep a thing back. And I even know the principles of\ntransposition!\" She looked at him, aghast.\n\n\"When I get back, I'm going to put a recommendation through department\nchannels that this whole sector be declared out of bounds for all\nparatime-transposition, until you people at Rhogom Foundation work\nout the problem of discarnate return to the First Level,\" he told her.\n\"Now, have you any notes or anything you want to take back with you?\"\n\nShe rose. \"Yes; just what's on the desk. Find me something to put the\ntape spools and notebooks in, while I'm getting them in order.\"\n\nHe secured a large game bag from under a rack of fowling pieces, and\nheld it while she sorted the material rapidly, stuffing spools of\nrecord tape and notebooks into it. They had barely begun when the door\nslid open and Olirzon, who had gone outside, sprang into the room, his\npistol drawn, swearing vilely.\n\n\"They've double-crossed us!\" he cried. \"The servants of Starpha have\nturned on us.\" He holstered his pistol and snatched up his\nsubmachine-gun, taking cover behind the edge of the door and letting\ngo with a burst in the direction of the lifter tubes. \"Got that one!\"\nhe grunted.\n\n\"What happened, Olirzon?\" Verkan Vall asked, dropping the game bag on\nthe table and hurrying across the room.\n\n\"I went up to see how Marnik was making out. As I came out of the\nlifter tube, one of the obscenities took a shot at me with a hunting\npistol. He missed me; I didn't miss him. Then a couple more of them\nwere coming up, with fowling pieces; I shot one of them before they\ncould fire, and jumped into the descent tube and came down heels over\nears. I don't know what's happened to Marnik.\" He fired another burst,\nand swore. \"Missed him!\"\n\n\"Assassins' Truce! Assassins' Truce!\" a voice howled out of the\ndescent tube. \"Hold your fire, we want to parley.\"\n\n\"Who is it?\" Dirzed shouted, over Olirzon's shoulder. \"You, Sarnax?\nCome on out; we won't shoot.\"\n\nThe young Assassin with the mustache and chin beard emerged from the\ndescent tube, his weapons sheathed and his clasped hands extended in\nfront of him in a peculiarly ecclesiastical-looking manner. Dirzed and\nOlirzon stepped out of the gun room, followed by Verkan Vall and\nHadron Dalla. Olirzon had left his submachine-gun behind. They met the\nother Assassin by the rim of the fountain pool.\n\n\"Lady Dallona of Hadron,\" the Starpha Assassin began. \"I and my\ncolleagues, in the employ of the family of Starpha, have received\norders from our clients to withdraw our protection from you, and to\ndiscarnate you, and all with you who undertake to protect or support\nyou.\" That much sounded like a recitation of some established formula;\nthen his voice became more conversational. \"I and my colleagues,\nErarno and Kirzol and Harnif, offer our apologies for the barbarity of\nthe servants of the family of Starpha, in attacking without\ndeclaration of cessation of friendship. Was anybody hurt or\ndiscarnated?\"\n\n\"None of us,\" Olirzon said. \"How about Marnik?\"\n\n\"He was warned before hostilities were begun against him,\" Sarnax\nreplied. \"We will allow five minutes until--\"\n\nOlirzon, who had been looking up the well, suddenly sprang at Dalla,\nknocking her flat, and at the same time jerking out his pistol. Before\nhe could raise it, a shot banged from above and he fell on his face.\nDirzed, Verkan Vall, and Sarnax, all drew their pistols, but whoever\nhad fired the shot had vanished. There was an outburst of shouting\nabove.\n\n\"Get to cover,\" Sarnax told the others. \"We'll let you know when we're\nready to attack; we'll have to deal with whoever fired that shot,\nfirst.\" He looked at the dead body on the floor, exclaimed angrily,\nand hurried to the ascent tube, springing upward.\n\nVerkan Vall replaced the small pistol in his shoulder holster and took\nOlirzon's belt, with his knife and heavier pistol.\n\n\"Well, there you see,\" Dirzed said, as they went back to the gun room.\n\"So much for political expediency.\"\n\n\"I think I understand why your picture and the Lady Dallona's were\nexhibited so widely,\" Verkan Vall said. \"Now, anybody would recognize\nyour bodies, and blame the Statisticalists for discarnating you.\"\n\n\"That thought had occurred to me, Lord Virzal,\" Dirzed said. \"I\nsuppose our bodies will be atrociously but not unidentifiably\nmutilated, to further enrage the public,\" he added placidly. \"If I get\nout of this carnate, I'm going to pay somebody off for it.\"\n\nAfter a few minutes, there was more shouting of: \"Assassins' Truce!\"\nfrom the descent tube. The two Assassins, Erarno and Kirzol, emerged,\ndragging the gamekeeper, Tarnod, between them. The upper-servant's\nface was bloody, and his jaw seemed to be broken. Sarnax followed,\ncarrying a long hunting pistol in his hand.\n\n\"Here he is!\" he announced. \"He fired during Assassins' Truce; he's\nsubject to Assassins' Justice!\"\n\nHe nodded to the others. They threw the gamekeeper forward on the\nfloor, and Sarnax shot him through the head, then tossed the pistol\ndown beside him. \"Any more of these people who violate the decencies\nwill be treated similarly,\" he promised.\n\n\"Thank you, Sarnax,\" Dirzed spoke up. \"But we lost an Assassin:\ndiscarnating this lackey won't equalize that. We think you should\nretire one of your number.\"\n\n\"That at least, Dirzed; wait a moment.\"\n\nThe three Assassins conferred at some length. Then Sarnax hooked\nfingers and clapped shoulders with his companions.\n\n\"See you in the next reincarnation, brothers,\" he told them, walking\ntoward the gun-room door, where Verkan Vall, Dalla and Dirzed stood.\n\"I'm joining you people. You had two Assassins when the parley began,\nyou'll have two when the shooting starts.\"\n\nVerkan Vall looked at Dirzed in some surprise. Hadron Dalla's Assassin\nnodded.\n\n\"He's entitled to do that, Lord Virzal; the Assassins' code provides\nfor such changes of allegiance.\"\n\n\"Welcome, Sarnax,\" Verkan Vall said, hooking fingers with him. \"I hope\nwe'll all be together when this is over.\"\n\n\"We will be,\" Sarnax assured him cheerfully. \"Discarnate. We won't get\nout of this in the body, Lord Virzal.\"\n\nA submachine-gun hammered from above, the bullets lashing the fountain\npool; the water actually steamed, so great was their velocity.\n\n\"All right!\" a voice called down. \"Assassins' Truce is over!\"\n\nAnother burst of automatic fire smashed out the lights at the bottom\nof the ascent tube. Dirzed and Dalla struggled across the room,\npushing a heavy steel cabinet between them; Verkan Vall, who was\nholding Olirzon's submachine-gun, moved aside to allow them to drop it\non edge in the open doorway, then wedged the door half-shut against\nit. Sarnax came over, bringing rifles, hunting pistols, and\nammunition.\n\n\"What's the situation, up there?\" Verkan Vall asked him. \"What force\nhave they, and why did they turn against us?\"\n\n\"Lord Virzal!\" Dirzed objected, scandalized. \"You have no right to ask\nSarnax to betray confidences!\"\n\nSarnax spat against the door. \"In the face of Jirzyn of Starpha!\" he\nsaid. \"And in the face of his _zortan_ mother, and of his father,\nwhoever he was! Dirzed, do not talk foolishly; one does not speak of\nbetraying betrayers.\" He turned to Verkan Vall. \"They have three\nmenservants of the family of Starpha; your Assassin, Olirzon,\ndiscarnated the other three. There is one of Prince Jirzyn's poor\nrelations, named Girzad. There are three other men, Volitionalist\nprecinct workers, who came with Girzad, and four Assassins, the three\nwho were here, and one who came with Girzad. Eleven, against the three\nof us.\"\n\n\"The four of us, Sarnax,\" Dalla corrected. She had buckled on a\nhunting pistol, and had a light deer rifle under her arm.\n\nSomething moved at the bottom of the descent tube. Verkan Vall gave it\na short burst, though it was probably only a dummy, dropped to draw\nfire.\n\n\"The four of us, Lady Dallona,\" Sarnax agreed. \"As to your other\nAssassin, the one who stayed in the airboat, I don't know how he\nfared. You see, about twenty minutes ago, this Girzad arrived in an\nairboat, with an Assassin and these three Volitionalist workers.\nErarno and I were at the top of the dome when he came in. He told us\nthat he had orders from Prince Jirzyn to discarnate the Lady Dallona\nand Dirzed at once. Tarnod, the gamekeeper\"--Sarnax spat ceremoniously\nagainst the door again--\"told him you were here, and that Marnik was\none of your men. He was going to shoot Marnik at once, but Erarno and\nI and his Assassin stopped him. We warned Marnik about the change in\nthe situation, according to the code, expecting Marnik to go down here\nand join you. Instead, he lifted the airboat, zoomed over Girzad's\nboat, and let go a rocket blast, setting Girzad's boat on fire. Well,\nthat was a hostile act, so we all fired after him. We must have hit\nsomething, because the boat went down, trailing smoke, about ten miles\naway. Girzad got another airboat out of the hangar and he and his\nAssassin started after your man. About that time, your Assassin,\nOlirzon--happy reincarnation to him--came up, and the Starpha servants\nfired at him, and he fired back and discarnated two of them, and then\njumped down the descent tube. One of the servants jumped after him; I\nfound his body at the bottom when I came down to warn you formally.\nYou know what happened after that.\"\n\n\"But why did Prince Jirzyn order our discarnation?\" Dalla wanted to\nknow. \"Was it to blame the Statisticalists with it?\"\n\nSarnax, about to answer, broke off suddenly and began firing at the\nopening of the ascent tube with a hunting pistol.\n\n\"I got him,\" he said, in a pleased tone. \"That was Erarno; he was\nalways playing tricks with the tubes, climbing down against negative\ngravity and up against positive gravity. His body will float up to the\ntop--Why, Lady Dallona, that was only part of it. You didn't hear\nabout the big scandal, on the newscast, then?\"\n\n\"We didn't have it on. What scandal?\"\n\nSarnax laughed. \"Oh, the very father and family-head of all scandals!\nYou ought to know about it, because you started it; that's why Prince\nJirzyn wants you out of the body--You devised a process by which\npeople could give themselves memory-recalls of previous\nreincarnations, didn't you? And distributed apparatus to do it with?\nAnd gave one set to young Tarnov, the son of Lord Tirzov of Fastor?\"\n\nDalla nodded. Sarnax continued:\n\n\"Well, last evening, Tarnox of Fastor used his recall outfit, and what\ndo you think? It seems that thirty years ago, in his last\nreincarnation, he was Jirzid of Starpha, Jirzyn's older brother.\nJirzid was betrothed to the Lady Annitra of Zabna. Well, his younger\nbrother was carrying on a clandestine affair with the Lady Annitra,\nand he also wanted the title of Prince and family-head of Starpha. So\nhe bribed this fellow Tarnod, whom I had the pleasure of discarnating,\nand who was an underservant here at the hunting lodge. Between them,\nthey shot Jirzid during a boar hunt. An accident, of course. So Jirzyn\nmarried the Lady Annitra, and when old Prince Jarnid, his father,\ndiscarnated a year later, he succeeded to the title. And immediately,\nTarnod was made head gamekeeper here.\"\n\n\"What did I tell you, Lord Virzal? I knew that son of a _zortan_ had\nsomething on Jirzyn of Starpha!\" Dirzed exclaimed. \"A nice family,\nthis of Starpha!\"\n\n\"Well, that's not the end of it,\" Sarnax continued. \"This morning,\nTarnov of Fastor, late Jirzid of Starpha, went before the High Court\nof Estates and entered suit to change his name to Jirzid of Starpha\nand laid claim to the title of Starpha family-head. The case has just\nbeen entered, so there's been no hearing, but there's the blazes of an\nargument among all the nobles about it--some are claiming that the\nindividuality doesn't change from one reincarnation to the next, and\nothers claiming that property and titles should pass along the line of\nphysical descent, no matter what individuality has reincarnated into\nwhat body. They're the ones who want the Lady Dallona discarnated and\nher discoveries suppressed. And there's talk about revising the entire\nsystem of estate-ownership and estate-inheritance. Oh, it's an utter\nobscenity of a business!\"\n\n\"This,\" Verkan Vall told Dalla, \"is something we will not emphasize\nwhen we get home.\" That was as close as he dared come to it, but she\ncaught his meaning. The working of major changes in out-time social\nstructures was not viewed with approval by the Paratime Commission on\nthe First Level. \"_If_ we get home,\" he added. Then an idea occurred\nto him.\n\n\"Dirzed, Sarnax; this place must have been used by the leaders of the\nVolitionalists for top-level conferences. Is there a secret passage\nanywhere?\"\n\nSarnax shook his head. \"Not from here. There is one, on the floor\nabove, but they control it. And even if there were one down here, they\nwould be guarding the outlet.\"\n\n\"That's what I was counting on. I'd hoped to simulate an escape that\nway, and then make a rush up the regular tubes.\" Verkan Vall shrugged.\n\"I suppose Marnik's our only chance. I hope he got away safely.\"\n\n\"He was going for help? I was surprised that an Assassin would desert\nhis client; I should have thought of that,\" Sarnax said. \"Well, even\nif he got down carnate, and if Girzad didn't catch him, he'd still be\nafoot ten miles from the nearest city unit. That gives us a little\nchance--about one in a thousand.\"\n\n\"Is there any way they can get at us, except by those tubes?\" Dalla\nasked.\n\n\"They could cut a hole in the floor, or burn one through,\" Sarnax\nreplied. \"They have plenty of thermite. They could detonate a charge\nof explosives over our heads, or clear out of the dome and drop one\ndown the well. They could use lethal gas or radiodust, but their\nAssassins wouldn't permit such illegal methods. Or they could shoot\nsleep-gas down at us, and then come down and cut our throats at their\nleisure.\"\n\n\"We'll have to get out of this room, then,\" Verkan Vall decided. \"They\nknow we've barricaded ourselves in here; this is where they'll\nattack. So we'll patrol the perimeter of the well; we'll be out of\ndanger from above if we keep close to the wall. And we'll inspect all\nthe rooms on this floor for evidence of cutting through from above.\"\n\nSarnax nodded. \"That's sense, Lord Virzal. How about the lifter\ntubes?\"\n\n\"We'll have to barricade them. Sarnax, you and Dirzed know the layout\nof this place better than the Lady Dallona or I; suppose you two check\nthe rooms, while we cover the tubes and the well,\" Verkan Vall\ndirected. \"Come on, now.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey pushed the door wide-open and went out past the cabinet. Hugging\nthe wall, they began a slow circuit of the well, Verkan Vall in the\nlead with the submachine-gun, then Sarnax and Dirzed, the former with\na heavy boar-rifle and the latter with a hunting pistol in each hand,\nand Hadron Dalla brought up in the rear with her rifle. It was she who\nnoticed a movement along the rim of the balcony above and snapped a\nshot at it; there was a crash above, and a shower of glass and plastic\nand metal fragments rattled on the pavement of the court. Somebody had\nbeen trying to lower a scanner or a visiplate-pickup, or something of\nthe sort; the exact nature of the instrument was not evident from the\nwreckage Dalla's bullet had made of it.\n\nThe rooms Dirzed and Sarnax entered were all quiet; nobody seemed to\nbe attempting to cut through the ceiling, fifteen feet above. They\ndragged furniture from a couple of rooms, blocking the openings of the\nlifter tubes, and continued around the well until they had reached the\ngun room again.\n\nDirzed suggested that they move some of the weapons and ammunition\nstored there to Prince Jirzyn's private apartment, halfway around to\nthe lifter tubes, so that another place of refuge would be stocked\nwith munitions in event of their being driven from the gun room.\n\nLeaving him on guard outside, Verkan Vall, Dalla and Sarnax entered\nthe gun room and began gathering weapons and boxes of ammunition.\nDalla finished packing her game bag with the recorded data and notes\nof her experiments. Verkan Vall selected four more of the heavy\nhunting pistols, more accurate than his shoulder-holster weapon or the\ndead Olirzon's belt arm, and capable of either full or semi-automatic\nfire. Sarnax chose a couple more boar rifles. Dalla slung her bag of\nrecorded notes, and another bag of ammunition, and secured another\ndeer rifle. They carried this accumulation of munitions to the private\napartments of Prince Jirzyn, dumping everything in the middle of the\ndrawing room, except the bag of notes, from which Dalla refused to\nseparate herself.\n\n\"Maybe we'd better put some stuff over in one of the rooms on the\nother side of the well,\" Dirzed suggested. \"They haven't really begun\nto come after us; when they do, we'll probably be attacked from two\nor three directions at once.\"\n\nThey returned to the gun room, casting anxious glances at the edge of\nthe balcony above and at the barricade they had erected across the\nopenings to the lifter tubes. Verkan Vall was not satisfied with this\nlast; it looked to him as though they had provided a breastwork for\nsomebody to fire on them from, more than anything else.\n\nHe was about to step around the cabinet which partially blocked the\ngun-room door when he glanced up, and saw a six-foot circle on the\nceiling turning slowly brown. There was a smell of scorched plastic.\nHe grabbed Sarnax by the arm and pointed.\n\n\"Thermite,\" the Assassin whispered. \"The ceiling's got six inches of\nspaceship-insulation between it and the floor above; it'll take them a\nfew minutes to burn through it.\" He stooped and pushed on the\nbarricade, shoving it into the room. \"Keep back; they'll probably drop\na grenade or so through, first, before they jump down. If we're quick,\nwe can get a couple of them.\"\n\nDirzed and Sarnax crouched, one at either side of the door, with\nweapons ready. Verkan Vall and Dalla had been ordered, rather\nperemptorily, to stay behind them; in a place of danger, an Assassin\nwas obliged to shield his client. Verkan Vall, unable to see what was\ngoing on inside the room, kept his eyes and his gun muzzle on the\nbarricade across the openings to the lifter tubes, the erection of\nwhich he was now regretting as a major tactical error.\n\nInside the gun room, there was a sudden crash, as the circle of\nthermite burned through and a section of ceiling dropped out and hit\nthe floor. Instantly, Dirzed flung himself back against Verkan Vall,\nand there was a tremendous explosion inside, followed by another and\nanother. A second or so passed, then Dirzed, leaning around the corner\nof the door, began firing rapidly into the room. From the other side\nof the door, Sarnax began blazing away with his rifle. Verkan Vall\nkept his position, covering the lifter tubes.\n\nSuddenly, from behind the barricade, a blue-white gun flash leaped\ninto being, and a pistol banged. He sprayed the opening between a\ncouch and a section of bookcase from whence it had come, releasing his\ntrigger as the gun rose with the recoil, squeezing and releasing and\nsqueezing again. Then he jumped to his feet.\n\n\"Come on, the other place; hurry!\" he ordered.\n\nSarnax swore in exasperation. \"Help me with her, Dirzed!\" he implored.\n\nVerkan Vall turned his head, to see the two Assassins drag Dalla to\nher feet and hustle her away from the gun room; she was quite\nsenseless, and they had to drag her between them. Verkan Vall gave a\nquick glance into the gun room; two of the Starpha servants and a man\nin rather flashy civil dress were lying on the floor, where they had\nbeen shot as they had jumped down from above. He saw a movement at the\nedge of the irregular, smoking, hole in the ceiling, and gave it a\nshort burst, then fired another at the exit from the descent tube.\nThen he took to his heels and followed the Assassins and Hadron Dalla\ninto Prince Jirzyn's apartment.\n\nAs he ran through the open door, the Assassins were letting Dalla down\ninto a chair; they instantly threw themselves into the work of\nbarricading the doorway so as to provide cover and at the same time\nallow them to fire out into the central well.\n\n[Illustration: ]\n\nFor an instant, as he bent over her, he thought Dalla had been killed,\nan assumption justified by his knowledge of the deadliness of Akor-Neb\nbullets. Then he saw her eye-lids flicker. A moment later, he had the\nexplanation of her escape. The bullet had hit the game bag at her\nside; it was full of spools of metal tape, in metal cases, and notes\nin written form, pyrographed upon sheets of plastic ring fastened into\nmetal binders. Because of their extreme velocity, Akor-Neb bullets\nwere sure killers when they struck animal tissue, but for the same\nreason, they had very poor penetration on hard objects. The\nalloy-steel tape, and the steel spools and spool cases, and the\nnotebook binders, had been enough to shatter the little bullet into\nsplinters of magnesium-nickel alloy, and the stout leather back of the\ngame bag had stopped all of these. But the impact, even distributed as\nit had been through the contents of the bag, had been enough to knock\nthe girl unconscious.\n\nHe found a bottle of some sort of brandy and a glass on a serving\ntable nearby and poured her a drink, holding it to her lips. She\nspluttered over the first mouthful, then took the glass from him and\nsipped the rest.\n\n\"What happened?\" she asked. \"I thought those bullets were sure death.\"\n\n\"Your notes. The bullet hit the bag. Are you all right, now?\"\n\nShe finished the brandy. \"I think so.\" She put a hand into the game\nbag and brought out a snarled and tangled mess of steel tape. \"Oh,\n_blast_! That stuff was important; all the records on the preliminary\nauto-recall experiments.\" She shrugged. \"Well, it wouldn't have been\nworth much more if I'd stopped that bullet, myself.\" She slipped the\nstrap over her shoulder and started to rise.\n\nAs she did, a bedlam of firing broke out, both from the two Assassins\nat the door and from outside. They both hit the floor and crawled out\nof line of the partly-open door; Verkan Vall recovered his\nsubmachine-gun, which he had set down beside Dalla's chair. Sarnax was\nfiring with his rifle at some target in the direction of the lifter\ntubes; Dirzed lay slumped over the barricade, and one glance at his\ncrumpled figure was enough to tell Verkan Vall that he was dead.\n\n\"You fill magazines for us,\" he told Dalla, then crawled to Dirzed's\nplace at the door. \"What happened, Sarnax?\"\n\n\"They shoved over the barricade at the lifter tubes and came out into\nthe well. I got a couple, they got Dirzed, and now they're holed up in\nrooms all around the circle. They--Aah!\" He fired three shots,\nquickly, around the edge of the door. \"That stopped that.\" The\nAssassin crouched to insert a fresh magazine into his rifle.\n\n[Illustration: ]\n\nVerkan Vall risked one eye around the corner of the doorway, and as he\ndid, there was a red flash and a dull roar, unlike the blue flashes\nand sharp cracking reports of the pistols and rifles, from the doorway\nof the gun room. He wondered, for a split second, if it might be one\nof the fowling pieces he had seen there, and then something whizzed\npast his head and exploded with a soft _plop_ behind him. Turning, he\nsaw a pool of gray vapor beginning to spread in the middle of the\nroom. Dalla must have got a breath of it, for she was slumped over the\nchair from which she had just risen.\n\nDropping the submachine-gun and gulping a lungful of fresh air from\noutside, Verkan Vall rushed to her, caught her by the heels, and\ndragged her into Prince Jirzyn's bedroom, beyond. Leaving her in the\nmiddle of the floor, he took another deep breath and returned to the\ndrawing room, where Sarnax was already overcome by the sleep-gas.\n\nHe saw the serving table from which he had got the brandy, and dragged\nit over to the bedroom door, overturning it and laying it across the\ndoorway, its legs in the air. Like most Akor-Neb serving tables, it\nhad a gravity-counteraction unit under it; he set this for double\nminus-gravitation and snapped it on. As it was now above the inverted\ntable, the table did not rise, but a tendril, of sleep-gas, curling\ntoward it, bent upward and drifted away from the doorway. Satisfied\nthat he had made a temporary barrier against the sleep-gas, Verkan\nVall secured Dalla's hunting pistol and spare magazines and lay down\nat the bedroom door.\n\nFor some time, there was silence outside. Then the besiegers evidently\ndecided that the sleep-gas attack had been a success. An Assassin,\nwearing a gas mask and carrying a submachine-gun, appeared in the\ndoorway, and behind him came a tall man in a tan tunic, similarly\nmasked. They stepped into the room and looked around.\n\nKnowing that he would be shooting over a two hundred percent negative\ngravitation-field, Verkan Vall aimed for the Assassin's belt-buckle\nand squeezed. The bullet caught him in the throat. Evidently the\nbullet had not only been lifted in the negative gravitation, but\nlifted point-first and deflected upward. He held his front sight just\nabove the other man's knee, and hit him in the chest.\n\nAs he fired, he saw a wisp of gas come sliding around the edge of the\ninverted table. There was silence outside, and for an instant, he was\ntempted to abandon his post and go to the bathroom, back of the\nbedroom, for wet towels to improvise a mask. Then, when he tried to\ncrawl backward, he could not. There was an impression of distant\nshouting which turned to a roaring sound in his head. He tried to lift\nhis pistol, but it slipped from his fingers.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen consciousness returned, he was lying on his back, and something\ncold and rubbery was pressing into his face. He raised his arms to\nfight off whatever it was, and opened his eyes, to find that he was\nstaring directly at the red oval and winged bullet of the Society of\nAssassins. A hand caught his wrist as he reached for the small pistol\nunder his arm. The pressure on his face eased.\n\n\"It's all right, Lord Virzal,\" a voice came to him. \"Assassins'\nTruce!\"\n\nHe nodded stupidly and repeated the words. \"Assassins' Truce; I won't\nshoot. What happened?\"\n\nThen he sat up and looked around. Prince Jirzyn's bedchamber was full\nof Assassins. Dalla, recovering from her touch of sleep-gas, was\nsitting groggily in a chair, while five or six of them fussed around\nher, getting in each others' way, handing her drinks, chaffing her\nwrists, holding damp cloths on her brow. That was standard procedure,\nwhen any group of males thought Dalla needed any help. Another\nAssassin, beside the bed, was putting away an oxygen-mask outfit, and\nthe Assassin who had prevented Verkan Vall from drawing his pistol was\nhis own follower, Marnik. And Klarnood, the Assassin-President, was\nsitting on the foot of the bed, smoking one of Prince Jirzyn's\nmonogrammed and crested cigarettes critically.\n\nVerkan Vall looked at Marnik, and then at Klarnood, and back to\nMarnik.\n\n\"You got through,\" he said. \"Good work, Marnik; I thought they'd\ndowned you.\"\n\n\"They did; I had to crash-land in the woods. I went about a mile on\nfoot, and then I found a man and woman and two children, hiding in one\nof these little log rain shelters. They had an airboat, a good one. It\nseemed that rioting had broken out in the city unit where they lived,\nand they'd taken to the woods till things quieted down again. I\noffered them Assassins' protection if they'd take me to Assassins'\nHall, and they did.\"\n\n\"By luck, I was in when Marnik arrived,\" Klarnood took over. \"We\nbrought three boatloads of men, and came here at once. Just as we got\nhere, two boatloads of Starpha dependents arrived; they tried to give\nus an argument, and we discarnated the lot of them. Then we came down\nhere, crying Assassins' Truce. One of the Starpha Assassins, Kirzol,\nwas still carnate; he told us what had been going on.\" The\nPresident-General's face-became grim. \"You know, I take a rather poor\nview of Prince Jirzyn's procedure in this matter, not to mention that\nof his underlings. I'll have to speak to him about this. Now, how\nabout you and the Lady Dallona? What do you intend doing?\"\n\n\"We're getting out of here,\" Verkan Vall said. \"I'd like air transport\nand protection as far as Ghamma, to the establishment of the family of\nZorda. Brarnend of Zorda has a private space yacht; he'll get us to\nVenus.\"\n\nKlarnood gave a sigh of obvious relief. \"I'll have you and the Lady\nDallona airborne and off for Ghamma as soon as you wish,\" he promised.\n\"I will, frankly, be delighted to see the last of both of you. The\nLady Dallona has started a fire here at Darsh that won't burn out in a\nhalf-century, and who knows what it may consume.\" He was interrupted\nby a heaving shock that made the underground dome dwelling shake like\na light airboat in turbulence. Even eighty feet under the ground, they\ncould hear a continued crashing roar. It was an appreciable interval\nbefore the sound and the shock ceased.\n\nFor an instant, there was silence, and then an excited bedlam of\nshouting broke from the Assassins in the room: Klarnood's face was\nfrozen in horror.\n\n\"That was a fission bomb!\" he exclaimed. \"The first one that has been\nexploded on this planet in hostility in a thousand years!\" He turned\nto Verkan Vall. \"If you feel well enough to walk, Lord Virzal, come\nwith us. I must see what's happened.\"\n\nThey hurried from the room and went streaming up the ascent tube to\nthe top of the dome. About forty miles away, to the south, Verkan Vall\nsaw the sinister thing that he had seen on so many other time-lines,\nin so many other paratime sectors--a great pillar of varicolored\nfire-shot smoke, rising to a mushroom head fifty thousand feet above.\n\n\"Well, that's it,\" Klarnood said sadly. \"That is civil war.\"\n\n\"May I make a suggestion, Assassin-President?\" Verkan Vall asked. \"I\nunderstand that Assassins' Truce is binding even upon non-Assassins;\nis that correct?\"\n\n\"Well, not exactly; it's generally kept by such non-Assassins as want\nto remain in their present reincarnations, though.\"\n\n\"That's what I meant. Well, suppose you declare a general, planet-wide\nAssassins' Truce in this political war, and make the leaders of both\nparties responsible for keeping it. Publish lists of the top two or\nthree thousand Statisticalists and Volitionalists, starting with\nMirzark of Bashad and Prince Jirzyn of Starpha, and inform them that\nthey will be assassinated, in order, if the fighting doesn't cease.\"\n\n\"Well!\" A smile grew on Klarnood's face. \"Lord Virzal, my thanks; a\ngood suggestion. I'll try it. And furthermore, I'll withdraw all\nAssassin protection permanently from anybody involved in political\nactivity, and forbid any Assassin to accept any retainer connected\nwith political factionalism. It's about time our members stopped\ndiscarnating each other in these political squabbles.\" He pointed to\nthe three airboats drawn up on the top of the dome; speedy black\ncraft, bearing the red oval and winged bullet. \"Take your choice, Lord\nVirzal. I'll lend you a couple of my men, and you'll be in Ghamma in\nthree hours.\" He hooked fingers and clapped shoulders with Verkan\nVall, bent over Dalla's hand. \"I still like you, Lord Virzal, and I\nhave seldom met a more charming lady than you, Lady Dallona. But I\nsincerely hope I never see either of you again.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe ship for Dhergabar was driving north and west; at seventy thousand\nfeet, it was still daylight, but the world below was wrapping itself\nin darkness. In the big visiscreens, which served in lieu of the\nwindows which could never have withstood the pressure and friction\nheat of the ship's speed, the sun was sliding out of sight over the\nhorizon to port. Verkan Vall and Dalla sat together, watching the\nblazing western sky--the sky of their own First Level time-line.\n\n\"I blame myself terribly, Vall,\" Dalla was saying. \"And I didn't mean\nany of them the least harm. All I was interested in was learning the\nfacts. I know, that sounds like 'I didn't know it was loaded,' but--\"\n\n\"It sounds to me like those Fourth Level Europo-American Sector\nphysicists who are giving themselves guilt-complexes because they\ndesigned an atomic bomb,\" Verkan Vall replied. \"All you were\ninterested in was learning the facts. Well, as a scientist, that's all\nyou're supposed to be interested in. You don't have to worry about any\nsocial or political implications. People have to learn to live with\nnewly-discovered facts; if they don't, they die of them.\"\n\n\"But, Vall; that sounds dreadfully irresponsible--\"\n\n\"Does it? You're worrying about the results of your reincarnation\nmemory-recall discoveries, the shootings and riotings and the bombing\nwe saw.\" He touched the pommel of Olirzon's knife, which he still\nwore. \"You're no more guilty of that than the man who forged this\nblade is guilty of the death of Marnark of Bashad; if he'd never\nlived, I'd have killed Marnark with some other knife somebody else\nmade. And what's more, you can't know the results of your discoveries.\nAll you can see is a thin film of events on the surface of an\nimmediate situation, so you can't say whether the long-term results\nwill be beneficial or calamitous.\n\n\"Take this Fourth Level Europo-American atomic bomb, for example. I\nchoose that because we both know that sector, but I could think of a\nhundred other examples in other paratime areas. Those people, because\nof deforestation, bad agricultural methods and general mismanagement,\nare eroding away their arable soil at an alarming rate. At the same\ntime, they are breeding like rabbits. In other words, each successive\ngeneration has less and less food to divide among more and more\npeople, and, for inherited traditional and superstitious reasons, they\nrefuse to adopt any rational program of birth-control and\npopulation-limitation.\n\n\"But, fortunately, they now have the atomic bomb, and they are\ndeveloping radioactive poisons, weapons of mass-effect. And their\nracial, nationalistic and ideological conflicts are rapidly reaching\nthe explosion point. A series of all-out atomic wars is just what that\nsector needs, to bring their population down to their world's carrying\ncapacity; in a century or so, the inventors of the atomic bomb will be\nhailed as the saviors of their species.\"\n\n\"But how about my work on the Akor-Neb Sector?\" Dalla asked. \"It seems\nthat my memory-recall technique is more explosive than any fission\nbomb. I've laid the train for a century-long reign of anarchy!\"\n\n\"I doubt that; I think Klarnood will take hold, now that he has\ncommitted himself to it. You know, in spite of his sanguinary\nprofession, he's the nearest thing to a real man of good will I've\nfound on that sector. And here's something else you haven't\nconsidered. Our own First Level life expectancy is from four to five\nhundred years. That's the main reason why we've accomplished as much\nas we have. We have, individually, time to accomplish things. On the\nAkor-Neb Sector, a scientist or artist or scholar or statesman will\ngrow senile and die before he's as old as either of us. But now, a\nyoung student of twenty or so can take one of your auto-recall\ntreatments and immediately have available all the knowledge and\nexperience gained in four or five previous lives. He can start where\nhe left off in his last reincarnation. In other words, you've made\nthose people time-binders, individually as well as racially. Isn't\nthat worth the temporary discarnation of a lot of ward-heelers and\nplug-uglies, or even a few decent types like Dirzed and Olirzon? If it\nisn't, I don't know what scales of values you're using.\"\n\n\"Vall!\" Dalla's eyes glowed with enthusiasm. \"I never thought of that!\nAnd you said, 'temporary discarnation.' That's just what it is. Dirzed\nand Olirzon and the others aren't dead; they're just waiting,\ndiscarnate, between physical lives. You know, in the sacred writings\nof one of the Fourth Level peoples it is stated: 'Death is the last\nenemy.' By proving that death is just a cyclic condition of continued\nindividual existence, these people have conquered their last enemy.\"\n\n\"Last enemy but one,\" Verkan Vall corrected. \"They still have one\nenemy to go, an enemy within themselves. Call it semantic confusion,\nor illogic, or incomprehension, or just plain stupidity. Like\nKlarnood, stymied by verbal objections to something labeled 'political\nintervention.' He'd never have consented to use the power of his\nSociety if he hadn't been shocked out of his inhibitions by that\nnuclear bomb. Or the Statisticalists, trying to create a classless\norder of society through a political program which would only result\nin universal servitude to an omnipotent government. Or the\nVolitionalist nobles, trying to preserve their hereditary feudal\nprivileges, and now they can't even agree on a definition of the term\n'hereditary.' Might they not recover all the silly prejudices of their\npast lives, along with the knowledge and wisdom?\"\n\n\"But ... I thought you said--\" Dalla was puzzled, a little hurt.\n\nVerkan Vall's arm squeezed around her waist, and he laughed\ncomfortingly.\n\n\"You see? Any sort of result is possible, good or bad. So don't blame\nyourself in advance for something you can't possibly estimate.\" An\nidea occurred to him, and he straightened in the seat. \"Tell you what;\nif you people at Rhogom Foundation get the problem of discarnate\nparatime transposition licked by then, let's you and I go back to the\nAkor-Neb Sector in about a hundred years and see what sort of a mess\nthose people have made of things.\"\n\n\"A hundred years: that would be Year Twenty-Two of the next\nmillennium. It's a date, Vall; we'll do it.\"\n\nThey bent to light their cigarettes together at his lighter. When\nthey raised their heads again and got the flame glare out of their\neyes, the sky was purple-black, dusted with stars, and dead ahead,\nspilling up over the horizon, was a golden glow--the lights of\nDhergabar and home.\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK LAST ENEMY***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 18800.txt or 18800.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/8/8/0/18800\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
