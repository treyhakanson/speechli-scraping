The city stretched out all around\nhim--broad avenues thronged with busy people, pedestrian walks,\nvehicle thoroughfares, aircars gliding between the gleaming, towering\nbuildings.\n\nAnd somewhere in this vast city was the man he must kill. The man who\nwould kill him, perhaps.\n\nIt all seemed so real! The noise of the streets, the odors of the\nperfumed trees lining the walks, even the warmth of the reddish sun on\nhis back as he scanned the scene before him.\n\n_It is an illusion_, Dulaq reminded himself, _a clever man-made\nhallucination. A figment of my own imagination amplified by a\nmachine._\n\nBut it seemed so very real.\n\nReal or not, he had to find Odal before the sun set. Find him and kill\nhim. Those were the terms of the duel. He fingered the stubby\ncylinderical stat-wind in his tunic pocket. That was the weapon he had\nchosen, his weapon, his own invention. And this was the environment he\nhad picked: his city, busy, noisy, crowded, the metropolis Dulaq had\nknown and loved since childhood.\n\nDulaq turned and glanced at the sun. It was halfway down toward the\nhorizon, he judged. He had about three hours to find Odal. When he\ndid--kill or be killed.\n\n_Of course no one is actually hurt. That is the beauty of the machine.\nIt allows one to settle a score, to work out aggressive feelings,\nwithout either mental or physical harm._\n\nDulaq shrugged. He was a roundish figure, moon-faced, slightly stooped\nshoulders. He had work to do. Unpleasant work for a civilized man, but\nthe future of the Acquataine Cluster and the entire alliance of\nneighboring star systems could well depend on the outcome of this\nelectronically synthesized dream.\n\nHe turned and walked down the elevated avenue, marveling at the sharp\nsensation of hardness that met each footstep on the paving. Children\ndashed by and rushed up to a toyshop window. Men of commerce strode\nalong purposefully, but without missing a chance to eye the girls\nsauntering by.\n\n_I must have a marvelous imagination_, Dulaq thought smiling to\nhimself.\n\nThen he thought of Odal, the blond, icy professional he was pitted\nagainst. Odal was an expert at all the weapons, a man of strength and\ncool precision, an emotionless tool in the hands of a ruthless\npolitician. But how expert could he be with a stat-wand, when the\nfirst time he saw one was the moment before the duel began? And how\nwell acquainted could he be with the metropolis, when he had spent\nmost of his life in the military camps on the dreary planets of Kerak,\nsixty light-years from Acquatainia?\n\nNo, Odal would be lost and helpless in this situation. He would\nattempt to hide among the throngs of people. All Dulaq had to do was\nto find him.\n\nThe terms of the duel restricted both men to the pedestrian walks of\nthe commercial quarter of the city. Dulaq knew the area intimately,\nand he began a methodical hunt through the crowds for the tall,\nfair-haired, blue-eyed Odal.\n\nAnd he saw him! After only a few minutes of walking down the major\nthoroughfare, he spotted his opponent, strolling calmly along a\ncrosswalk, at the level below.\n\nDulaq hurried down the next ramp, worked his way through the crowd,\nand saw the man again. Tall and blond, unmistakable. Dulaq edged along\nbehind him quietly, easily. No disturbance. No pushing. Plenty of\ntime. They walked along the street for a quarter hour while the\ndistance between them slowly shrank from fifty feet to five.\n\nFinally Dulaq was directly behind him, within arm's reach. He grasped\nthe stat-wand and pulled it from his tunic. With one quick motion he\ntouched it to the base of the man's skull and started to thumb the\nbutton that would release the killing bolt of energy ...\n\nThe man turned suddenly. It wasn't Odal!\n\nDulaq jerked back in surprise. It couldn't be. He had seen his face.\nIt was Odal--and yet this man was definitely a stranger.\n\nHe stared at Dulaq as the duelist backed away a few steps, then turned\nand walked quickly from the place.\n\n_A mistake_, Dulaq told himself. _You were overanxious. A good thing\nthis is an hallucination, or else the auto-police would be taking you\nin by now._\n\nAnd yet ... he had been so certain that it was Odal. A chill shuddered\nthrough him. He looked up, and there was his antagonist, on the\nthoroughfare above, at the precise spot where he himself had been a\nfew minutes earlier. Their eyes met, and Odal's lips parted in a cold\nsmile.\n\nDulaq hurried up the ramp. Odal was gone by the time he reached the\nupper level. _He could not have gotten far_, Dulaq reasoned. Slowly,\nbut very surely, Dulaq's hallucination turned into a nightmare. He\nspotted Odal in the crowd, only to have him melt away. He saw him\nagain, lolling in a small park, but when he got closer, the man turned\nout to be another stranger. He felt the chill of the duelist's\nice-blue eyes on him again and again, but when he turned to find his\nantagonist, no one was there but the impersonal crowd.\n\nOdal's face appeared again and again. Dulaq struggled through the\nthrongs to find his opponent, only to have him vanish. The crowd\nseemed to be filled with tall, blond men crisscrossing before Dulaq's\ndismayed eyes.\n\nThe shadows lengthened. The sun was setting. Dulaq could feel his\nheart pounding within him and perspiration pouring from every square\ninch of his skin.\n\nThere he is! Definitely, positively him! Dulaq pushed through the\nhomeward-bound crowds toward the figure of a tall, blond man leaning\nagainst the safety railing of the city's main thoroughfare. It was\nOdal, the damned smiling confident Odal.\n\nDulaq pulled the wand from his tunic and battled across the surging\ncrowd to the spot where Odal stood motionless, hands in pockets,\nwatching him.\n\nDulaq came within arm's reach ...\n\n\"TIME, GENTLEMEN. TIME IS UP, THE DUEL IS ENDED.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHigh above the floor of the antiseptic-white chamber that housed the\ndueling machine was a narrow gallery. Before the machine had been\ninstalled, the chamber had been a lecture hall in Acquatainia's\nlargest university. Now the rows of students' seats, the lecturer's\ndais and rostrum were gone. The chamber held only the machine, the\ngrotesque collection of consoles, control desks, power units,\nassociation circuits, and booths where the two antagonists sat.\n\nIn the gallery--empty during ordinary duels--sat a privileged handful\nof newsmen.\n\n\"Time limit is up,\" one of them said. \"Dulaq didn't get him.\"\n\n\"Yes, but he didn't get Dulaq, either.\"\n\nThe first one shrugged. \"The important thing is that now Dulaq has to\nfight Odal on his terms. Dulaq couldn't win with his own choice of\nweapons and situation, so--\"\n\n\"Wait, they're coming out.\"\n\nDown on the floor below, Dulaq and his opponent emerged from their\nenclosed booths.\n\nOne of the newsmen whistled softly. \"Look at Dulaq's face ... it's\npositively gray.\"\n\n\"I've never seen the Prime Minister so shaken.\"\n\n\"And take a look at Kanus' hired assassin.\" The newsmen turned toward\nOdal, who stood before his booth, quietly chatting with his seconds.\n\n\"Hm-m-m. There's a bucket of frozen ammonia for you.\"\n\n\"He's enjoying this.\"\n\nOne of the newsmen stood up. \"I've got a deadline to meet. Save my\nseat.\"\n\nHe made his way past the guarded door, down the rampway circling the\nouter walls of the building, to the portable tri-di transmitting unit\nthat the Acquatainian government had permitted for the newsmen on the\ncampus grounds outside the former lecture hall.\n\nThe newsman huddled with his technicians for a few minutes, then\nstepped before the transmitter.\n\n\"Emile Dulaq, Prime Minister of the Acquataine Cluster and\nacknowledged leader of the coalition against Chancellor Kanus of the\nKerak Worlds, has failed in the first part of his psychonic duel\nagainst Major Par Odal of Kerak. The two antagonists are now\nundergoing the routine medical and psychological checks before\nrenewing their duel.\"\n\nBy the time the newsman returned to his gallery seat, the duel was\nalmost ready to begin again.\n\nDulaq stood in the midst of a group of advisors before the looming\nimpersonality of the machine.\n\n\"You need not go through with the next phase of the duel immediately,\"\nhis Minister of Defense was saying. \"Wait until tomorrow. Rest and\ncalm yourself.\"\n\nDulaq's round face puckered into a frown. He cocked an eye at the\nchief meditech, hovering at the edge of the little group.\n\nThe meditech, one of the staff that ran the dueling machine, pointed\nout, \"The Prime Minister has passed the examinations. He is capable,\nwithin the agreed-upon rules of the contest, of resuming.\"\n\n\"But he has the option of retiring for the day, does he not?\"\n\n\"If Major Odal agrees.\"\n\nDulaq shook his head impatiently. \"No. I shall go through with it.\nNow.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\nThe prime minister's face suddenly hardened; his advisors lapsed into\na respectful silence. The chief meditech ushered Dulaq back into his\nbooth. On the other side of the room, Odal glanced at the\nAcquatainians, grinned humorlessly, and strode to his own booth.\n\nDulaq sat and tried to blank out his mind while the meditechs adjusted\nthe neurocontacts to his head and torso. They finished at last and\nwithdrew. He was alone in the booth now, looking at the dead-white\nwalls, completely bare except for the viewscreen before his eyes. The\nscreen finally began to glow slightly, then brightened into a series\nof shifting colors. The colors merged and changed, swirled across his\nfield of view. Dulaq felt himself being drawn into them gradually,\ncompellingly, completely immersed in them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe mists slowly vanished, and Dulaq found himself standing on an\nimmense and totally barren plain. Not a tree, not a blade of grass;\nnothing but bare, rocky ground stretching in all directions to the\nhorizon and disturbingly harsh yellow sky. He looked down and at his\nfeet saw the weapon that Odal had chosen.\n\nA primitive club.\n\nWith a sense of dread, Dulaq picked up the club and hefted it in his\nhand. He scanned the plain. Nothing. No hills or trees or bushes to\nhide in. No place to run to.\n\nAnd off on the horizon he could see a tall, lithe figure holding a\nsimilar club walking slowly and deliberately toward him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe press gallery was practically empty. The duel had more than an\nhour to run, and most of the newsmen were outside, broadcasting their\nhastily-drawn guesses about Dulaq's failure to win with his own choice\nof weapon and environment.\n\nThen a curious thing happened.\n\nOn the master control panel of the dueling machine, a single light\nflashed red. The meditech blinked at it in surprise, then pressed a\nseries of buttons on his board. More red lights appeared. The chief\nmeditech rushed to the board and flipped a single switch.\n\nOne of the newsmen turned to his partner. \"What's going on down\nthere?\"\n\n\"I think it's all over.... Yes, look, they're opening up the booths.\nSomebody must've scored a victory.\"\n\nThey watched intently while the other newsmen quickly filed back into\nthe gallery.\n\n\"There's Odal. He looks happy.\"\n\n\"Guess that means--\"\n\n\"Good Lord! Look at Dulaq!\"\n\n\nII\n\nDr. Leoh was lecturing at the Carinae Regional University when the\nnews of Dulaq's duel reached him. An assistant professor perpetrated\nthe unthinkable breach of interrupting the lecture to whisper the news\nin his ear.\n\nLeoh nodded grimly, hurriedly finished his lecture, and them\naccompanied the assistant professor to the University president's\noffice. They stood in silence as the slideway whisked them through the\nstrolling students and blossoming greenery of the quietly-busy campus.\n\nLeoh remained wrapped in his thoughts as they entered the\nadministration building and rode the lift tube. Finally, as they\nstepped through the president's doorway, Leoh asked the assistant\nprofessor:\n\n\"You say he was in a state of catatonic shock when they removed him\nfrom the machine?\"\n\n\"He still is,\" the president answered from his desk. \"Completely\nwithdrawn from the real world. Cannot speak, hear, or even see--a\nliving vegetable.\"\n\nLeoh plopped down in the nearest chair and ran a hand across his\nfleshy face. He was balding and jowly, but his face was creased from a\nsmile that was almost habitual, and his eyes were active and alert.\n\n\"I don't understand it,\" he admitted. \"Nothing like this has ever\nhappened in a dueling machine before.\"\n\nThe university president shrugged. \"I don't understand it either. But,\nthis is your business.\" He put a slight emphasis on the last word,\nunconsciously perhaps.\n\n\"Well, at least this will not reflect on the university. That is why I\nformed Psychonics as a separate business enterprise.\" Then he added,\nwith a grin, \"The money was, of course, only a secondary\nconsideration.\"\n\nThe president managed a smile. \"Of course.\"\n\n\"I suppose the Acquatainians want to see me?\" Leoh asked academically.\n\n\"They're on the tri-di now, waiting for you.\"\n\n\"They're holding a transmission frequency open over eight hundred\nparsecs?\" Leoh looked impressed. \"I must be an important man.\"\n\n\"You're the inventor of the dueling machine and the head of\nPsychonics, Inc. You're the only man who can tell them what went\nwrong.\"\n\n\"Well, I suppose I shouldn't keep them waiting.\"\n\n\"You can take the call here,\" the president said, starting to get up\nfrom his chair.\n\n\"No, no, stay there at your desk,\" Leoh insisted. \"There's no reason\nfor you to leave. Or you either,\" he said to the assistant professor.\n\nThe president touched a button on his desk communicator. The far wall\nof the office glowed momentarily, then seemed to dissolve. They were\nlooking into another office, this one on Acquatainia. It was crowded\nwith nervous-looking men in business clothes and military uniforms.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" Dr. Leoh said.\n\nSeveral of the Acquatainians tried to answer him at once. After a few\nseconds of talking together, they all looked toward one of their\nmembers--a tall, purposeful, shrewd-faced civilian who bore a\nneatly-trimmed black beard.\n\n\"I am Fernd Massan, the Acting Prime Minister of Acquatainia. You\nrealize, of course, the crisis that has been precipitated in my\nGovernment because of this duel?\"\n\nLeoh blinked. \"I realize that apparently there has been some\ndifficulty with the dueling machine installed on the governing planet\nof your star cluster. Political crises are not in my field.\"\n\n\"But your dueling machine has incapacitated the Prime Minister,\" one\nof the generals bellowed.\n\n\"And at this particular moment,\" the defense minister added, \"in the\nmidst of our difficulties with the Kerak Worlds.\"\n\n\"If the Prime Minister is not--\"\n\n\"Gentlemen!\" Leoh objected. \"I cannot make sense of your story if you\nall speak at once.\"\n\nMassan gestured them to silence.\n\n\"The dueling machine,\" Leoh said, adopting a slightly professorial\ntone, \"is nothing more than a psychonic device for alleviating human\naggressions and hostilities. It allows for two men to share a dream\nworld created by one of them. There is a nearly-complete feedback\nbetween the two. Within certain limits, two men can do anything they\nwish within their dream world. This allows men to settle grievances\nwith violence--in the safety of their own imaginations. If the machine\nis operated properly, no physical or mental harm can be done to the\nparticipants. They can alleviate their tensions safely--without damage\nof any sort to anyone, and without hurting society.\n\n\"Your own Government tested one of the machines and approved its use\non Acquatainia more than three years ago. I see several of you who\nwere among those to whom I personally demonstrated the device.\nDuelling machines are in use through wide portions of the galaxy, and\nI am certain that many of you have used the machine. You have,\ngeneral, I'm sure.\"\n\nThe general blustered. \"That has nothing to do with the matter at\nhand!\"\n\n\"Admittedly,\" Leoh conceded. \"But I do not understand how a\ntherapeutic machine can possibly become entangled in a political\ncrisis.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nMassan said: \"Allow me to explain. Our Government has been conducting\nextremely delicate negotiations with the stellar governments of our\nneighboring territories. These negotiations concern the rearmaments of\nthe Kerak Worlds. You have heard of Kanus of Kerak?\"\n\n\"I recall the name vaguely,\" Leoh said. \"He's a political leader of\nsome sort.\"\n\n\"Of the worst sort. He has acquired complete dictatorship of the Kerak\nWorlds, and is now attempting to rearm them for war. This is in direct\ncountervention of the Treaty of Acquatainia, signed only thirty Terran\nyears ago.\"\n\n\"I see. The treaty was signed at the end of the Acquataine-Kerak war,\nwasn't it?\"\n\n\"A war that we won,\" the general pointed out.\n\n\"And now the Kerak Worlds want to rearm and try again,\" Leoh said.\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\nLeoh shrugged. \"Why not call in the Star Watch? This is their type of\npolice activity. And what has all this to do with the dueling\nmachine?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMassan explained patiently, \"The Acquataine Cluster has never become a\nfull-fledged member of the Terran Commonwealth. Our neighboring\nterritories are likewise unaffiliated. Therefore the Star Watch can\nintervene only if all parties concerned agree to intervention. Unless,\nof course, there is an actual military emergency. The Kerak Worlds, of\ncourse, are completely isolationist--unbound by any laws except those\nof force.\"\n\nLeoh shook his head.\n\n\"As for the dueling machine,\" Massan went on, \"Kanus of Kerak has\nturned it into a political weapon--\"\n\n\"But that's impossible. Your government passed strict laws concerning\nthe use of the machine; I recommended them and I was in your Council\nchambers when the laws were passed. The machine may be used only for\npersonal grievances. It is strictly outside the realm of politics.\"\n\nMassan shook his head sadly. \"Sir, laws are one thing--people are\nanother. And politics consists of people, not words on paper.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" Leoh said.\n\nMassan explained, \"A little more than one Terran year ago, Kanus\npicked a quarrel with a neighboring star-group--the Safad Federation.\nHe wanted an especially favorable trade agreement with them. Their\nminister of trade objected most strenuously. One of the Kerak\nnegotiators--a certain Major Odal--got into a personal argument with\nthe minister. Before anyone knew what had happened, they had\nchallenged each other to a duel. Odal won the duel, and the minister\nresigned his post. He said that he could no longer effectively fight\nagainst the will of Odal and his group ... he was psychologically\nincapable of it. Two weeks later he was dead--apparently a suicide,\nalthough I have doubts.\"\n\n\"That's ... extremely interesting,\" Leoh said.\n\n\"Three days ago,\" Massan continued, \"the same Major Odal engaged Prime\nMinister Dulaq in a bitter personal argument. Odal is now a military\nattach\u00e9 of the Kerak Embassy here. He accused the Prime Minister of\ncowardice, before a large group of an Embassy party. The Prime\nMinister had no alternative but to challenge him. And now--\"\n\n\"And now Dulaq is in a state of shock, and your government is\ntottering.\"\n\nMassan's back stiffened. \"Our Government shall not fall, nor shall the\nAcquataine Cluster acquiesce to the rearmament of the Kerak Worlds.\nBut\"--his voice lowered--\"without Dulaq, I fear that our neighboring\ngovernments will give in to Kanus' demands and allow him to rearm.\nAlone, we are powerless to stop him.\"\n\n\"Rearmament itself might not be so bad,\" Leoh mused, \"if you can keep\nthe Kerak Worlds from using their weapons. Perhaps the Star Watch\nmight--\"\n\n\"Kanus could strike a blow and conquer a star system before the Star\nWatch could be summoned and arrive to stop him. Once Kerak is armed,\nthis entire area of the galaxy is in peril. In fact, the entire galaxy\nis endangered.\"\n\n\"And he's using the dueling machine to further his ambitions,\" Leoh\nsaid. \"Well, gentlemen, it seems I have no alternative but to travel\nto the Acquataine Cluster. The dueling machine is my responsibility,\nand if there is something wrong with it, or the use of it, I will do\nmy best to correct the situation.\"\n\n\"That is all we ask,\" Massan said. \"Thank you.\"\n\nThe Acquatainian scene faded away, and the three men in the university\npresident's office found themselves looking at a solid wall once\nagain.\n\n\"Well,\" Dr. Leoh said, turning to the president, \"it seems that I must\nrequest an indefinite leave of absence.\"\n\nThe president frowned. \"And it seems that I must grant your\nrequest--even though the year is only half-finished.\"\n\n\"I regret the necessity,\" Leoh said; then, with a broad grin, he\nadded, \"My assistant professor, here, can handle my courses for the\nremainder of the year very easily. Perhaps he will even be able to\ndeliver his lectures without being interrupted.\"\n\nThe assistant professor turned red.\n\n\"Now then,\" Leoh muttered, mostly to himself, \"who is this Kanus, and\nwhy is he trying to turn the Kerak Worlds into an arsenal?\"\n\n\nIII\n\nChancellor Kanus, the supreme leader of the Kerak Worlds, stood at the\nedge of the balcony and looked across the wild, tumbling gorge to the\nrugged mountains beyond.\n\n\"These are the forces that mold men's actions,\" he said to his small\naudience of officials and advisors, \"the howling winds, the mighty\nmountains, the open sky and the dark powers of the clouds.\"\n\nThe men nodded and made murmurs of agreement.\n\n\"Just as the mountains thrust up from the pettiness of the lands\nbelow, so shall we rise above the common walk of men,\" Kanus said.\n\"Just as a thunderstorm terrifies them, we will make them bend to our\nwill!\"\n\n\"We will destroy the past,\" said one of the ministers.\n\n\"And avenge the memory of defeat,\" Kanus added. He turned and looked\nat the little group of men. Kanus was the smallest man on the balcony:\nshort, spare, sallow-faced; but he possessed piercing dark eyes and a\nstrong voice that commanded attention.\n\nHe walked through the knot of men and stopped before a tall, lean,\nblond youth in light-blue military uniform. \"And you, Major Odal, will\nbe a primary instrument in the first steps of conquest.\"\n\nOdal bowed stiffly. \"I only hope to serve my leader and my worlds.\"\n\n\"You shall. And you already have,\" Kanus said, beaming. \"Already the\nAcquatainians are thrashing about like a snake whose head has been cut\noff. Without Dulaq, they have no head, no brain to direct them. For\nyour part in this triumph\"--Kanus snapped his fingers, and one of his\nadvisors quickly stepped to his side and handed him a small ebony\nbox--\"I present you with this token of the esteem of the Kerak Worlds,\nand of my personal high regard.\"\n\nHe handed the box to Odal, who opened it and took out a small jeweled\npin.\n\n\"The Star of Kerak,\" Kanus announced. \"This is the first time it has\nbeen awarded to anyone except a warrior on the battlefield. But then,\nwe have turned their so-called civilized machine into our own\nbattlefield, eh?\"\n\nOdal grinned. \"Yes, sir, we have. Thank you very much sir. This is the\nsupreme moment of my life.\"\n\n\"To date, major. Only to date. There will be other moments, even\nhigher ones. Come, let's go inside. We have many plans to discuss ...\nmore duels ... more triumphs.\"\n\nThey all filed in to Kanus' huge, elaborate office. The leader walked\nacross the plushly ornate room and sat at the elevated desk, while his\nfollowers arranged themselves in the chairs and couches placed about\nthe floor. Odal remained standing, near the doorway.\n\nKanus let his fingers flick across a small control board set into his\ndesktop, and a tri-dimensional star map glowed into existence on the\nfar wall. As its center were the eleven stars that harbored the Kerak\nWorlds. Around them stood neighboring stars, color-coded to show their\npolitical groupings. Off to one side of the map was the Acquataine\nCluster, a rich mass of stars--wealthy, powerful, the most important\npolitical and economic power in the section of the galaxy. Until\nyesterday's duel.\n\nKanus began one of his inevitable harangues. Objectives, political and\nmilitary. Already the Kerak Worlds were unified under his dominant\nwill. The people would follow wherever he led. Already the political\nalliances built up by the Acquatainian diplomacy since the last war\nwere tottering, now that Dulaq was out of the picture. Now was the\ntime to strike. A political blow _here_, at the Szarno Confederacy, to\nbring them and their armaments industries into line with Kerak. Then\nmore political strikes to isolate the Acquataine Cluster from its\nallies, and to build up the subservient states for Kerak. Then,\nfinally, the military blow--against the Acquatainians.\n\n\"A sudden strike, a quick, decisive series of blows, and the\nAcquatainians will collapse like a house of paper. Before the Star\nWatch can interfere, we will be masters of the Cluster. Then, with the\nresources of Acquatainia to draw on, we can challenge any force in the\ngalaxy--even the Terran Commonwealth itself!\"\n\nThe men in the room nodded their assent.\n\n_They've heard this story many, many times_, Odal thought to himself.\nThis was the first time he had been privileged to listen to it. If you\nclosed your eyes, or looked only at the star map, the plan sounded\nbizarre, extreme, even impossible. But, if you watched Kanus, and let\nthose piercing, almost hypnotic eyes fasten on yours, then the\nleader's wildest dreams sounded not only exciting, but inevitable.\n\nOdal leaned a shoulder against the paneled wall and scanned the other\nmen in the room.\n\nThere was fat Greber, the vice chancellor, fighting desperately to\nstay awake after drinking too much wine during the luncheon and\nafterward. And Modal, sitting on the couch next to him, was\nbright-eyed and alert, thinking only of how much money and power would\ncome to him as Chief of Industries once the rearmament program began\nin earnest.\n\nSitting alone on another couch was Kor, the quiet one, the head of\nIntelligence, and--technically--Odal's superior. Silent Kor, whose few\nwords were usually charged with terror for those whom he spoke\nagainst.\n\nMarshal Lugal looked bored when Kanus spoke of politics, but his face\nchanged when military matters came up. The marshal lived for only one\npurpose: to avenge his army's humiliating defeat in the war against\nthe Acquatainians, thirty Terran years ago. What he didn't realize,\nOdal thought, smiling to himself, was that as soon as he had\nreorganized the army and re-equipped it, Kanus planned to retire him\nand place younger men in charge. Men whose only loyalty was not to the\narmy, not even to the Kerak Worlds and their people, but to the\nchancellor himself.\n\nEagerly following every syllable, every gesture of the leader was\nlittle Tinth. Born to the nobility, trained in the arts, a student of\nphilosophy, Tinth had deserted his heritage and joined the forces of\nKanus. His reward had been the Ministry of Education; many teachers\nhad suffered under him.\n\nAnd finally there was Romis, the Minister of Intergovernmental\nAffairs. A professional diplomat, and one of the few men in government\nbefore Kanus' sweep to power to survive this long. It was clear that\nRomis hated the chancellor. But he served the Kerak Worlds well. The\ndiplomatic corps was flawless in their handling of intergovernmental\naffairs. It was only a matter of time, Odal knew, before one of\nthem--Romis or Kanus--killed the other.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe rest of Kanus' audience consisted of political hacks,\nroughnecks-turned-bodyguards, and a few other hangers-on who had been\nwith Kanus since the days when he held his political monologues in\ncellars, and haunted the alleys to avoid the police. Kanus had come a\nlong way: from the blackness of oblivion to the dazzling heights of\nthe chancellor's rural estate.\n\nMoney, power, glory, revenge, patriotism: each man in the room,\nlistening to Kanus, had his reasons for following the chancellor.\n\n_And my reasons?_ Odal asked himself. _Why do I follow him? Can I see\ninto my own mind as easily as I see into theirs?_\n\nThere was duty, of course. Odal was a soldier, and Kanus was the\nduly-elected leader of the government. Once elected, though, he had\ndissolved the government and solidified his powers as absolute\ndictator of the Kerak Worlds.\n\nThere was gain to be had by performing well under Kanus. Regardless of\nhis political ambitions and personal tyrannies, Kanus rewarded well\nwhen he was pleased. The medal--the Star of Kerak--carried with it an\nannual pension that would nicely accommodate a family. _If I had one_,\nOdal thought, sardonically.\n\nThere was power, of sorts, also. Working the dueling machine in his\nspecial way, hammering a man into nothingness, finding the weaknesses\nin his personality and exploiting them, pitting his mind against\nothers, turning sneering towers of pride like Dulaq into helpless\nwhipped dogs--that was power. And it was a power that did not go\nunnoticed in the cities of the Kerak Worlds. Already Odal was easily\nrecognized on the streets; women especially seemed to be attracted to\nhim now.\n\n\"The most important factor,\" Kanus was saying, \"and I cannot stress it\novermuch, is to build up an aura of invincibility. This is why your\nwork is so important, Major Odal. You must be invincible! Because\ntoday you represent the collective will of the Kerak Worlds. To-day\nyou are the instrument of my own will--and you must triumph at every\nturn. The fate of your people, of your government, of your chancellor\nrests squarely on your shoulders each time you step into a dueling\nmachine. You have borne that responsibility well, major. Can you carry\nit even further?\"\n\n\"I can, sir,\" Odal answered crisply, \"and I will.\"\n\nKanus beamed at him. \"Good! Because your next duel--and those that\nfollow it--will be to the death.\"\n\n\nIV\n\nIt took the starship two weeks to make the journey from Carinae to the\nAcquataine Cluster. Dr. Leoh spent the time checking over the\nAcquatainian dueling machine, by direct tri-di beam; the Acquatainian\ngovernment gave him all the technicians, time and money he needed for\nthe task.\n\nLeoh spent as much of his spare time as possible with the other\npassengers of the ship. He was gregarious, a fine conversationalist,\nand had a nicely-balanced sense of humor. Particularly, he was a\nfavorite of the younger women, since he had reached the age where he\ncould flatter them with his attention without making them feel\nendangered.\n\nBut still, there were long hours when he was alone in his stateroom\nwith nothing but his memories. At times like these, it was impossible\nnot to think back over the road he had been following.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAlbert Robertus Leoh, Ph.D., Professor of Physics, Professor of\nElectronics, master of computer technology, inventor of the\ninterstellar tri-di communications system; and more recently, student\nof psychology, Professor of Psychophysiology, founder of Psychonics,\nInc., inventor of the dueling machine.\n\nDuring his earlier years, when the supreme confidence of youth was\nstill with him, Leoh had envisioned himself as helping mankind to\nspread his colonies and civilizations throughout the galaxy. The\nbitter years of galactic war had ended in his childhood, and now human\nsocieties throughout the Milky Way were linked together--in greater or\nlesser degree of union--into a more-or-less peaceful coalition of star\ngroups.\n\nThere were two great motivating forces at work on those human\nsocieties spread across the stars, and these forces worked toward\nopposite goals. On the one hand was the urge to explore, to reach new\nstars, new planets, to expand the frontiers of man's civilizations and\nfound new colonies, new nations. Pitted against this drive to expand\nwas an equally-powerful force: the realization that technology had\nfinally put an end to physical labor and almost to poverty itself on\nall the civilized worlds of man. The urge to move off to the frontier\nwas penned in and buried alive under the enervating comforts of\ncivilization.\n\nThe result was inescapable. The civilized worlds became constantly\nmore crowded as time wore on. They became jampacked islands of\nhumanity sprinkled thinly across the sea of space that was still full\nof unpopulated islands.\n\nThe expense and difficulty of interstellar travel was often cited as\nan excuse. The starships _were_ expensive: their power demands were\nfrightful. Only the most determined--and the best financed--groups of\ncolonists could afford them. The rest of mankind accepted the ease and\nsafety of civilization, lived in the bulging cities of the teeming\nplanets. Their lives were circumscribed by their neighbors, and by\ntheir governments. Constantly more people crowding into a fixed living\nspace meant constantly less freedom. The freedom to dream, to run\nfree, to procreate, all became state-owned, state-controlled\nmonopolies.\n\nAnd Leoh had contributed to this situation.\n\nHe had contributed his thoughts and his work. He had contributed often\nand regularly--the interstellar communications systems was only the\none outstanding achievement in a long career of achievements.\n\nLeoh had been nearly at the voluntary retirement age for scientists\nwhen he realized what he, and his fellow scientists, had done. Their\nefforts to make life richer and more rewarding for mankind had made\nlife only less strenuous and more rigid.\n\nAnd with every increase in comfort, Leoh discovered, came a\ncorresponding increase in neuroses, in crimes of violence, in mental\naberrations. Senseless wars of pride broke out between star-groups for\nthe first time in generations. Outwardly, the peace of the galaxy was\nassured; but beneath the glossy surface of the Terran Commonwealth\nthere smoldered the beginnings of a volcano. Police actions fought by\nthe Star Watch were increasing ominously. Petty wars between\nonce-stable peoples were flaring up steadily.\n\nOnce Leoh realized the part he had played in this increasingly tragic\ndrama, he was confronted with two emotions--a deep sense of guilt,\nboth personal and professional; and, countering this, a determination\nto do something, anything, to restore at least some balance to man's\ncollective mentality.\n\nLeoh stepped out of physics and electronics, and entered the field of\npsychology. Instead of retiring, he applied for a beginner's status in\nhis new profession. It had taken considerable bending and straining of\nthe Commonwealth's rules--but for a man of Leoh's stature, the rules\ncould be flexed somewhat. Leoh became a student once again, then a\nresearcher, and finally a Professor of Psychophysiology.\n\nOut of this came the dueling machine. A combination of\nelectroencephalograph and autocomputer. A dream machine, that\namplified a man's imagination until he could engulf himself into a\nworld of his own making.\n\nLeoh envisioned it as a device to enable men to rid themselves of\nhostility and tension safely. Through his efforts, and those of his\ncolleagues, dueling machines were quickly becoming accepted devices\nfor settling disputes.\n\nWhen two men had a severe difference of opinion--deep enough to\nwarrant legal action--they could go to the dueling machine instead of\nthe courts. Instead of sitting helplessly and watching the\nmachinations of the law grind impersonally through their differences,\nthe two antagonists could allow their imaginations free rein in the\ndueling machine. They could settle their differences personally, as\nviolently as they wished, without hurting themselves or anyone else.\nOn most civilized worlds, the results of properly-monitored duels were\naccepted as legally binding.\n\nThe tensions of civilized life could be escaped--albeit\ntemporarily--in the dueling machine. This was a powerful tool, much\ntoo powerful to allow it to be used indiscriminately. Therefore Leoh\nsafeguarded his invention by forming a private company--Psychonics,\nInc.--and securing an exclusive license from the Terran Commonwealth\nto manufacture, sell, install and maintain the machines. His customers\nwere government health and legal agencies; his responsibilities were:\nlegally, to the Commonwealth; morally, to all mankind; and finally, to\nhis own restless conscience.\n\nThe dueling machines succeeded. They worked as well, and often better,\nthan Leoh had anticipated. But he knew that they were only a stopgap,\nonly a temporarily shoring of a constantly-eroding dam. What was\nneeded, really needed, was some method of exploding the status quo,\nsome means of convincing people to reach out for those unoccupied,\nunexplored stars that filled the galaxy, some way of convincing men\nthat they should leave the comforts of civilization for the excitement\nof colonization.\n\nLeoh had been searching for that method when the news of Dulaq's duel\nagainst Odal reached him.\n\nNow he was speeding across parsecs of space, praying to himself that\nthe dueling machine had not failed.\n\nThe two-week flight ended. The starship took up a parking orbit around\nthe capital planet of Acquataine Cluster. The passengers transhipped\nto the surface.\n\nDr. Leoh was met at the landing disk by an official delegation, headed\nby Massan, the acting prime minister. They exchanged formal greetings\nthere at the base of the ship, while the other passengers hurried by.\n\nAs Leoh and Massan, surrounded by the other members of the delegation,\nrode the slideway to the port's administration building, Leoh\ncommented:\n\n\"As you probably know, I have checked through your dueling machine\nquite thoroughly via tri-di for the past two weeks. I can find nothing\nwrong with it.\"\n\nMassan shrugged. \"Perhaps you should have checked then, the machine on\nSzarno.\"\n\n\"The Szarno Confederation? Their dueling machine?\"\n\n\"Yes. This morning Kanus' hired assassin killed a man in it.\"\n\n\"He won another duel,\" Leoh said.\n\n\"You do not understand,\" Massan said grimly, \"Major Odal's\nopponent--an industrialist who had spoken out against Kanus--was\nactually killed in the dueling machine. The man is dead!\"\n\n\nV\n\nOne of the advantages of being Commander-in-Chief of the Star Watch,\nthe old man thought to himself, is that you can visit any planet is\nthe Commonwealth.\n\nHe stood at the top of the hill and looked out over the green table\nland of Kenya. This was the land of his birth, Earth was his\nhomeworld. The Star Watch's official headquarters may be in the heart\nof a globular cluster of stars near the center of the galaxy, but\nEarth was the place the commander wanted most to see as he grew older\nand wearier.\n\nAn aide, who had been following the commander at a respectful\ndistance, suddenly intruded himself in the old man's reverie.\n\n\"Sir, a message for you.\"\n\nThe commander scowled at the young officer. \"I gave orders that I was\nnot to be disturbed.\"\n\nThe officer, slim and stiff in his black-and-silver uniform, replied.\n\"Your chief of staff has passed the message on to you, sir. It's from\nDr. Leoh, of Carinae University. Personal and urgent, sir.\"\n\nThe old man grumbled to himself, but nodded. The aide placed a small\ncrystalline sphere on the grass before him. The air above the sphere\nstarted to vibrate and glow.\n\n\"Sir Harold Spencer here,\" the commander said.\n\nThe bubbling air seemed to draw in on itself and take solid form. Dr.\nLeoh sat at a desk chair and looked up at the standing commander.\n\n\"Harold, it's a pleasure to see you once again.\"\n\nSpencer's stern eyes softened, and his beefy face broke into a\nwell-creased smile. \"Albert, you ancient scoundrel. What do you mean\nby interrupting my first visit home in fifteen years?\"\n\n\"It won't be a long interruption,\" Leoh said.\n\n\"You told my chief of staff that it was urgent,\" Sir Harold groused.\n\n\"It is. But it's not the sort of problem that requires much action on\nyour part. Yet. You are familiar with recent political developments on\nthe Kerak Worlds?\"\n\nSpencer snorted. \"I know that a barbarian named Kanus has established\nhimself as a dictator. He's a troublemaker. I've been talking to the\nCommonwealth Council about the advisability of quashing him before he\ncauses grief, but you know the Council ... first wait until the flames\nhave sprung up, then thrash about and demand that the Star Watch do\nsomething!\"\n\nLeoh grinned. \"You're as irascible as ever.\"\n\n\"My personality is not the subject of this rather expensive\ndiscussion. What about Kanus? And what are you doing, getting yourself\ninvolved in politics? About to change your profession again?\"\n\n\"No, not at all,\" Leoh answered, laughing. Then, more seriously. \"It\nseems as though Kanus has discovered some method of using the dueling\nmachines to achieve political advantages over his neighbors.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nLeoh explained the circumstances of Odal's duels with the Acquatainian\nprime minister and Szarno Industrialist.\n\n\"Dulaq is completely incapacitated and the other poor fellow is dead?\"\nSpencer's face darkened into a thundercloud. \"You were right to call\nme. This is a situation that could easily become intolerable.\"\n\n\"I agree,\" Leoh said. \"But evidently Kanus has not broken any laws or\ninterstellar agreements. All that meets the eye is a disturbing pair\nof accidents, both of them accruing to Kanus' benefit.\"\n\n\"Do you believe that they were accidents?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. The dueling machine cannot cause physical or mental\nharm ... unless someone has tampered with it in some way.\"\n\n\"That is my thought, too.\" Spencer was silent for a moment, weighing\nthe matter in his mind. \"Very well. The Star Watch cannot act\nofficially, but there is nothing to prevent me from dispatching an\nofficer to the Acquataine Cluster, on detached duty, to serve as\nliaison between us.\"\n\n\"Good. I think that will be the most effective method of handling the\nsituation, at present.\"\n\n\"It will be done.\" Sir Harold pronounced. His aide made a mental note\nof it.\n\n\"Thank you very much,\" Leoh said. \"Now, go back to enjoying your\nvacation.\"\n\n\"Vacation? This is no vacation,\" Spencer rumbled. \"I happen to be\ncelebrating my birthday.\"\n\n\"So? Well, congratulations. I try not to remember mine,\" Leoh said.\n\n\"Then you must be older than I,\" Spencer replied, allowing only the\nfaintest hint of a smile to appear.\n\n\"I suppose it's possible.\"\n\n\"But not very likely, eh?\"\n\nThey laughed together and said good-by. The Star Watch commander\ntramped through the hills until sunset, enjoying the sight of the\ngrasslands and distant purple mountains he had known in his childhood.\nAs dusk closed in, he told his aide he was ready to leave.\n\nThe aide pressed a stud on his belt and a two-place aircar skimmed\nsilently from the far side of the hills and hovered beside them.\nSpencer climbed in laboriously while the aide remained discreetly at\nhis side. While the commander settled his bulk into his seat the aide\nhurried around the car and hopped into his place. The car glided off\ntoward Spencer's personal planetship, waiting for him at a nearby\nfield.\n\n\"Don't forget to assign an officer to Dr. Leoh,\" the commander\nmuttered to his aide. Then he turned and watched the unmatchable\nbeauty of an Earthly sunset.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe aide did not forget the assignment. That night, as Sir Harold's\nship spiraled out to a rendezvous with a starship, the aide dictated\nthe necessary order into a autodispatcher that immediately beamed it\nto the Star Watch's nearest communications center, on Mars.\n\nThe order was scanned and routed automatically and finally beamed to\nthe Star Watch unit commandant in charge of the area closest to the\nAcquataine Cluster, on the sixth planet circling the star Perseus\nAlpha. Here again, the order was processed automatically and routed\nthrough the local headquarters to the personnel files. The automated\nfiles selected three microcard dossiers that matched the requirements\nof the order.\n\nThe three microcards and the order itself appeared simultaneously on\nthe desktop viewer of the Star Watch personnel officer. He looked at\nthe order, then read the dossiers. He flicked a button that gave him\nan updated status report on each of the three men in question. One was\ndue for leave after an extensive period of duty. The second was the\nson of a personal friend of the local commandant. The third had just\narrived a few weeks ago, fresh from the Star Watch Academy on Mars.\n\nThe personnel officer selected the third man, routed his dossier and\nSir Harold's order back into the automatic processing system, and\nreturned to the film of primitive dancing girls he had been watching\nbefore this matter of decision had arrived at his desk.\n\n\nVI\n\nThe space station orbiting around Acquatainia--the capital planet of\nthe Acquataine Cluster--served simultaneously as a transfer point from\nstarships to planetships, a tourist resort, meteorological station,\ncommunications center, scientific laboratory, astronomical\nobservatory, medical haven for allergy and cardiac patients, and\nmilitary base. It was, in reality, a good-sized city with its own\nmarkets, its own local government, and its own way of life.\n\nDr. Leoh had just stepped off the debarking ramp of the starship from\nSzarno. The trip there had been pointless and fruitless. But he had\ngone anyway, in the slim hope that he might find something wrong with\nthe dueling machine that had been used to murder a man.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nA shudder went through him as he edged along the automated customs\nscanners and paper-checkers. What kind of people could these men of\nKerak be? To actually kill a human being in cold blood; to plot and\nplan the death of a fellow man. Worse than barbaric. Savage.\n\nHe felt tired as he left customs and took the slideway to the\nplanetary shuttle ships. Halfway there, he decided to check at the\ncommunications desk for messages. That Star Watch officer that Sir\nHarold had promised him a week ago should have arrived by now.\n\nThe communications desk consisted of a small booth that contained the\noutput printer of a communications computer and an attractive young\ndark-haired girl. Automation or not, Leoh thought smilingly, there\nwere certain human values that transcended mere efficiency.\n\nA lanky, thin-faced youth was half-leaning on the booth's counter,\ntrying to talk to the girl. He had curly blond hair and crystal blue\neyes; his clothes consisted of an ill-fitting pair of slacks and\ntunic. A small traveler's kit rested on the floor at his feet.\n\n\"So, I was sort of, well, thinking ... maybe somebody might, uh, show\nme around ... a little,\" he was stammering to the girl. \"I've never\nbeen, uh, here ...\"\n\n\"It's the most beautiful planet in the galaxy,\" the girl was saying.\n\"Its cities are the finest.\"\n\n\"Yes ... well, I was sort of thinking ... that is, I know we just, uh,\nmet a few minutes ago ... but, well, maybe ... if you have a free day\nor so coming up ... maybe we could, uh, sort of--\".\n\nShe smiled coolly. \"I have two days off at the end of the week, but\nI'll be staying here at the station. There's so much to see and do\nhere, I very seldom leave.\"\n\n\"Oh--\"\n\n\"You're making a mistake,\" Leoh interjected dogmatically, \"If you have\nsuch a beautiful planet for your homeworld, why in the name of the\ngods of intellect don't you go down there and enjoy it? I'll wager you\nhaven't been out in the natural beauty and fine cities you spoke of\nsince you started working here on the station.\"\n\n\"Why, you're right,\" she said, surprised.\n\n\"You see? You youngsters are all alike. You never think further than\nthe ends of your noses. You should return to the planet, young lady,\nand see the sunshine again. Why don't you visit the University at the\ncapital city? Plenty of open space and greenery, lots of sunshine and\navailable young men!\"\n\nLeoh was grinning broadly, and the girl smiled back at him. \"Perhaps I\nwill,\" she said.\n\n\"Ask for me when you get to the University. I'm Dr. Leoh. I'll see to\nit that you're introduced to some of the girls and gentlemen of your\nown age.\"\n\n\"Why ... thank you, doctor. I'll do it this week end.\"\n\n\"Good. Now then, any messages for me? Anyone aboard the station\nlooking for me?\"\n\nThe girl turned and tapped a few keys on the computer's console. A row\nof lights flicked briefly across the console's face. She turned back\nto Leoh:\n\n\"No, sir, I'm sorry. No message and no one has asked for you.\"\n\n\"Hm-m-m. That's strange. Well, thank you ... and I'll expect to see\nyou at the end of this week.\"\n\nThe girl smiled a farewell. Leoh started to walk away from the booth,\nback toward the slideway. The young man took a step toward him,\nstumbled on his own traveling kit, and staggered across the floor for\na half-dozen steps before regaining his balance. Leoh turned and saw\nthat the youth's face bore a somewhat ridiculous expression of mixed\nindecision and curiosity.\n\n\"Can I help you?\" Leoh asked, stopping at the edge of the moving\nslideway.\n\n\"How ... how did you do that, sir?\"\n\n\"Do what?\"\n\n\"Get that girl to agree to visit the university. I've been talking to\nher for half an hour, and, well, she wouldn't even look straight at\nme.\"\n\nLeoh broke into a chuckle. \"Well, young man, to begin with, you were\nmuch too flustered. It made you appear overanxious. On the other hand,\nI am at an age where I can be strictly platonic. She was on guard\nagainst you, but she knows she has very little to fear from me.\"\n\n\"I see ... I think.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Leoh said, gesturing toward the slideway, \"I suppose this is\nwhere we go our separate ways.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, sir. I'm going with you. That is, I mean, you _are_ Dr. Leoh,\naren't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am. And you must be--\" Leoh hesitated. _Can this be a Star\nWatch officer?_ he wondered.\n\nThe youth stiffened to attention and for an absurd flash of a second,\nLeoh thought he was going to salute. \"I am Junior Lieutenant Hector,\nsir; on special detached duty from the cruiser SW4-J188, home base\nPerseus Alpha VI.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Leoh replied. \"Um-m-m ... is Hector your first name or your\nlast?\"\n\n\"Both, sir.\"\n\n_I should have guessed_, Leoh told himself. Aloud, he said, \"Well,\nlieutenant, we'd better get to the shuttle before it leaves without\nus.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey took to the slideway. Half a second later, Hector jumped off and\ndashed back to the communications desk for his traveling kit. He\nhurried back to Leoh bumping into seven bewildered citizens of various\ndescriptions and nearly breaking both his legs when he tripped as he\nran back onto the moving slideway. He went down on his face, sprawled\nacross two lanes moving at different speeds, and needed the assistance\nof several persons before he was again on his feet and standing beside\nLeoh.\n\n\"I ... I'm sorry to cause all that, uh, commotion, sir.\"\n\n\"That's all right. You weren't hurt, were you?\"\n\n\"Uh, no ... I don't think so. Just embarrassed.\"\n\nLeoh said nothing. They rode the slideway in silence through the busy\nstation and out to the enclosed berths where the planetary shuttles\nwere docked. They boarded one of the ships and found a pair of seats.\n\n\"Just how long have you been with Star Watch, lieutenant?\"\n\n\"Six weeks, sir. Three weeks aboard a starship bringing me out to\nPerseus Alpha VI, a week at the planetary base there, and two weeks\naboard the cruiser SW4-J188. That is, it's been six weeks since I\nreceived my commission. I've been at the Academy ... the Star Watch\nAcademy on Mars ... for four years.\"\n\n\"You got through the Academy in four years?\"\n\n\"That's the regulation time, sir.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know.\"\n\nThe ship eased out of its berth. There was a moment of free-fall, then\nthe drive engine came on and the grav-field equilibrated.\n\n\"Tell me, lieutenant, how did you get picked for this assignment?\"\n\n\"I wish I knew, sir,\" Hector said, his lean face twisting into a puzzled\nfrown. \"I was working out a program for the navigation officer ... aboard\nthe cruiser. I'm pretty good at that ... I can work out computer programs\nin my head, mostly. Mathematics was my best subject at the Academy--\"\n\n\"Interesting.\"\n\n\"Yes, well, anyway, I was working out this program when the captain\nhimself came on deck and started shaking my hand telling me that I was\nbeing sent on special duty on Acquatainia by direct orders of the\nCommander-in-Chief. He seemed very happy ... the captain, that is.\"\n\n\"He was no doubt pleased to see you get such an unusual assignment,\"\nLeoh said tactfully.\n\n\"I'm not sure,\" Hector said truthfully. \"I think he regarded me as\nsome sort of a problem, sir. He had me on a different duty-berth\npractically every day I was on board the ship.\"\n\n\"Well now,\" Leoh changed the subject, \"what do you know about\npsychonics?\"\n\n\"About what, sir?\"\n\n\"Eh ... electroencephalography?\"\n\nHector looked blank.\n\n\"Psychology, perhaps?\" Leoh suggested, hopefully, \"Physiology?\nComputer molectronics?\"\n\n\"I'm pretty good at mathematics!\"\n\n\"Yes, I know. Did you, by any chance, receive any training in\ndiplomatic affairs?\"\n\n\"At the Star Watch Academy? No, sir.\"\n\nLeah ran a hand through his thinning hair. \"Then why did the Star\nWatch select you for this job? I must confess, lieutenant, that I\ncan't understand the workings of a military organization.\"\n\nHector shook his head ruefully, \"Neither do I, sir.\"\n\n\nVII\n\nThe next week was an enervatingly slow one for Leoh, evenly divided\nbetween tedious checking of each component of the dueling machine, and\nshameless ruses to keep Hector as far away from the machine as\npossible.\n\nThe Star Watchman certainly wanted to help, and he actually was little\nshort of brilliant in doing intricate mathematics completely in his\nhead. But he was, Leoh found, a clumsy, chattering, whistling,\nscatterbrained, inexperienced bundle of noise and nerves. It was\nimpossible to do constructive work with him nearby.\n\n_Perhaps you're judging him too harshly_, Leoh warned himself. _You\njust might be letting your frustrations with the dueling machine get\nthe better of your sense of balance._\n\nThe professor was sitting in the office that the Acquatainians had\ngiven him in one end of the former lecture hall that held the dueling\nmachine. Leoh could see its impassive metal hulk through the open\noffice door.\n\nThe room he was sitting in had been one of a suite of offices used by\nthe permanent staff of the machine. But they had moved out of the\nbuilding completely, in deference to Leoh, and the Acquatainian\ngovernment had turned the other cubbyhole offices into sleeping rooms\nfor the professor and the Star Watchman, and an auto-kitchen. A\ncombination cook-valet-handyman appeared twice each day--morning and\nevening--to handle any special chores that the cleaning machines and\nauto-kitchen might miss.\n\nLeoh slouched back in his desk chair and cast a weary eye on the stack\nof papers that recorded the latest performances of the machine.\nEarlier that day he had taken the electroencephalographic records of\nclinical cases of catatonia and run them through the machine's input\nunit. The machine immediately rejected them, refused to process them\nthrough the amplification units and association circuits.\n\nIn other words, the machine had recognized the EEG traces as something\nharmful to a human being.\n\n_Then how did it happen to Dulaq?_ Leoh asked himself for the\nthousandth time. It couldn't have been the machine's fault; it must\nhave been something in Odal's mind that simply overpowered Dulaq's.\n\n_\"Overpowered?\" That's a terribly unscientific term_, Leoh argued\nagainst himself.\n\nBefore he could carry the debate any further, he heard the main door\nof the big chamber slide open and then bang shut, and Hector's off-key\nwhistle shrilled and echoed through the high-vaulted room.\n\nLeoh sighed and put his self-contained argument off to the back of his\nmind. Trying to think logically near Hector was a hopeless prospect.\n\n\"Are you in, doctor?\" Hector's voice rang out.\n\n\"In here.\"\n\nHector ducked in through the doorway and plopped his rangy frame on\nthe office's couch.\n\n\"Everything going well, sir?\"\n\nLeoh shrugged. \"Not very well, I'm afraid. I can't find anything wrong\nwith the dueling machine. I can't even _force_ it to malfunction.\"\n\n\"Well, that's good, isn't it?\" Hector chirped happily.\n\n\"In a sense,\" Leoh admitted, feeling slightly nettled at the youth's\nboundless, pointless optimism. \"But, you see, it means that Kanus'\npeople can do things with the machine that I can't.\"\n\nHector frowned, considering the problem. \"Hm-m-m ... yes, I guess\nthat's right, too, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Did you see the girl back to her ship safely?\" Leoh asked.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Hector replied, bobbing his head vigorously. \"She's on her\nway back to the communications booth at the space station. She said to\ntell you she enjoyed her visit very much.\"\n\n\"Good. It was, eh, very good of you to escort her about the campus. It\nkept her out of my hair ... what's left of it, that is.\"\n\nHector grinned. \"Oh, I liked showing her around, and all that--And,\nwell, it sort of kept me out of your hair, too, didn't it?\"\n\nLeoh's eyebrows shot up in surprise.\n\nHector laughed. \"Doctor, I may be clumsy, and I'm certainly no\nscientist ... but I'm not completely brainless.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry if I gave you that impression--\"\n\n\"Oh no ... don't be sorry. I didn't mean that to sound so ... well,\nthe way it sounded ... that is. I know I'm just in your way--\" He\nstarted to get up.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLeoh waved him back to the couch. \"Relax, my boy, relax. You know,\nI've been sitting here all afternoon wondering what to do next.\nSomehow, just now, I came to a conclusion.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I'm going to leave the Acquataine Cluster and return to Carinae.\"\n\n\"What? But you can't! I mean--\"\n\n\"Why not? I'm not accomplishing anything here. Whatever it is that\nthis Odal and Kanus have been doing, it's basically a political\nproblem, and not a scientific one. The professional staff of the\nmachine here will catch up to their tricks sooner or later.\"\n\n\"But, sir, if you can't find the answer, how can they?\"\n\n\"Frankly, I don't know. But, as I said, this is a political problem\nmore than a scientific one. I'm tired and frustrated and I'm feeling\nmy years. I want to return to Carinae and spend the next few months\nconsidering beautifully abstract problems about instantaneous\ntransportation devices. Let Massan and the Star Watch worry about\nKanus.\"\n\n\"Oh! That's what I came to tell you. Massan has been challenged to a\nduel by Odal!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"This afternoon, Odal went to the Council building. Picked an argument\nwith Massan right in the main corridor and challenged him.\"\n\n\"Massan accepted?\" Leoh asked.\n\nHector nodded.\n\nLeoh leaned across his desk and reached for the phone unit. It took a\nfew minutes and a few levels of secretaries and assistants, but\nfinally Massan's dark, bearded face appeared on the screen above the\ndesk.\n\n\"You have accepted Odal's challenge?\" Leoh asked, without\npreliminaries.\n\n\"We meet next week,\" Massan replied gravely.\n\n\"You should have refused.\"\n\n\"On what pretext?\"\n\n\"No pretext. A flat refusal, based on the certainty that Odal or\nsomeone else from Kerak is tampering with the dueling machine.\"\n\nMassan shook his head sadly. \"My dear learned sir, you still do not\ncomprehend the political situation. The Government of the Acquataine\nCluster is much closer to dissolution than I dare to admit openly. The\ncoalition of star groups that Dulaq had constructed to keep the Kerak\nWorlds neutralized has broken apart completely. This morning, Kanus\nannounced that he would annex Szarno. This afternoon, Odal challenges\nme.\"\n\n\"I think I see--\"\n\n\"Of course. The Acquatainian Government is paralyzed now, until the\noutcome of the duel is known. We cannot effectively intervene in the\nSzarno crisis until we know who will be heading the Government next\nweek. And, frankly, more than a few members of our Council are now\nopenly favouring Kanus and urging that we establish friendly relations\nwith him before it is too late.\"\n\n\"But, that's all the more reason for refusing the duel,\" Leoh\ninsisted.\n\n\"And be accused of cowardice in my own Council meetings?\" Massan\nsmiled grimly. \"In politics, my dear sir, the _appearance_ of a man\nmeans much more than his substance. As a coward, I would soon be out\nof office. But perhaps, as the winner of a duel against the invincible\nOdal ... or even as a martyr ... I may accomplish something useful.\"\n\nLeoh said nothing.\n\nMassan continued, \"I put off the duel for a week, hoping that in that\ntime you might discover Odal's secret. I dare not postpone the duel\nany longer; as it is, the political situation may collapse about our\nheads at any moment.\"\n\n\"I'll take this machine apart and rebuild it again, molecule by\nmolecule,\" Leoh promised.\n\nAs Massan's image faded from the screen, Leoh turned to Hector. \"We\nhave one week to save his life.\"\n\n\"And avert a war, maybe,\" Hector added.\n\n\"Yes.\" Leoh leaned back in his chair and stared off into infinity.\n\nHector shuffled his feet, rubbed his nose, whistled a few bars of\noff-key tunes, and finally blurted, \"How can you take apart the\ndueling machine?\"\n\n\"Hm-m-m?\" Leoh snapped out of his reverie.\n\n\"How can you take apart the dueling machine?\" Hector repeated. \"Looks\nlike a big job to do in a week.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is. But, my boy, perhaps we ... the two of us ... can do it.\"\n\nHector scratched his head. \"Well, uh, sir ... I'm not very ... that\nis, my mechanical aptitude scores at the Academy--\"\n\nLeoh smiled at him. \"No need for mechanical aptitude, my boy. You were\ntrained to fight, weren't you? We can do the job mentally.\"\n\n\nVIII\n\nIt was the strangest week of their lives.\n\nLeoh's plan was straightforward: to test the dueling machine, push it\nto the limits of its performance, by actually operating it--by\nfighting duels.\n\nThey started off easily enough, tentatively probing and flexing their\nmental muscles. Leoh had used the dueling machine himself many times\nin the past, but only in tests of the machines' routine performance.\nNever in actual combat against another human being. To Hector, of\ncourse, the machine was a totally new and different experience.\n\nThe Acquatainian staff plunged into the project without question,\nproviding Leoh with invaluable help in monitoring and analyzing the\nduels.\n\nAt first, Leoh and Hector did nothing more than play hide-and-seek,\nwith one of them picking an environment and the other trying to find\nhis opponent in it. They wandered through jungles and cities, over\nglaciers and interplanetary voids, seeking each other--without ever\nleaving the booths of the dueling machine.\n\nThen, when Leoh was satisfied that the machine could reproduce and\namplify thought patterns with strict fidelity, they began to fight\nlight duels. The fenced with blunted foils--Hector won, of course,\nbecause of his much faster reflexes. Then they tried other\nweapons--pistols, sonic beams, grenades--but always wearing protective\nequipment. Strangely, even though Hector was trained in the use of\nthese weapons, Leoh won almost all the bouts. He was neither faster\nnor more accurate, when they were target-shooting. But when the two of\nthem faced each other, somehow Leoh almost always won.\n\n_The machine project more than thoughts_, Leoh told himself. _It\nprojects personality._\n\nThey worked in the dueling machine day and night now, enclosed in the\nbooths for twelve or more hours a day, driving themselves and the\nmachine's regular staff to near-exhaustion. When they gulped their\nmeals, between duels, they were physically ragged and sharp-tempered.\nThey usually fell asleep in Leoh's office, while discussing the\nresults of the day's work.\n\nThe duels grew slowly more serious. Leoh was pushing the machine to\nits limits now, carefully extending the rigors of each bout. And yet,\neven though he knew exactly what and how much he intended to do in\neach fight, it often took a conscious effort of will to remind\nhimself that the battles he was fighting were actually imaginary.\n\nAs the duels became more dangerous, and the artificially-amplified\nhallucinations began to end in blood and death, Leoh found himself\nwinning more and more frequently. With one part of his mind he was\ndriving to analyze the cause of his consistent success. But another\npart of him was beginning to really enjoy his prowess.\n\nThe strain was telling on Hector. The physical exertion of constant\nwork and practically no relief was considerable in itself. But the\nemotional effects of being \"hurt\" and \"killed\" repeatedly were\ninfinitely worse.\n\n\"Perhaps we should stop for a while,\" Leoh suggested after the fourth\nday of tests.\n\n\"No, I'm all right.\"\n\nLeoh looked at him. Hector's face was haggard, his eyes bleary.\n\n\"You've had enough,\" Leoh said quietly.\n\n\"Please don't make me stop,\" Hector begged. \"I ... I can't stop now.\nPlease give me a chance to do better. I'm improving ... I lasted twice\nas long in this afternoon's two duels as I did in the ones this\nmorning. Please, don't end it now ... not while I'm completely lost--\"\n\nLeoh stared at him, \"You want to go on?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"And if I say no?\"\n\nHector hesitated. Leoh sensed he was struggling with himself. \"If you\nsay no,\" he answered dully, \"then it will be no. I can't argue against\nyou any more.\"\n\nLeoh was silent for a long moment. Finally he opened a desk drawer and\ntook a small bottle from it. \"Here, take a sleep capsule. When you\nwake up we'll try again.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was dawn when they began again. Leoh entered the dueling machine\ndetermined to allow Hector to win. He gave the youthful Star Watchman\nhis choice of weapon and environment. Hector picked one-man\nscoutships, in planetary orbits. Their weapons were conventional force\nbeams.\n\nBut despite his own conscious desire, Leoh found himself winning! The\nships spiraled about an unnamed planet, their paths intersecting at\nleast once in every orbit. The problem was to estimate your opponent's\norbital position, and then program your own ship so that you arrived\nat that position either behind or to one side of him. Then you could\ntrain your guns on him before he could turn on you.\n\nThe problem should have been an easy one for Hector, with his knack\nfor intuitive mental calculation. But Leoh scored the first\nhit--Hector had piloted his ship into an excellent firing position,\nbut his shot went wide; Leoh maneuvered around clumsily, but managed\nto register an inconsequential hit on the side of Hector's ship.\n\nIn the next three passes, Leoh scored two more hits. Hector's ship\nwas badly damaged now. In return, the Star Watchman had landed one\nglancing shot on Leoh's ship.\n\nThey came around again, and once more Leoh had outguessed his younger\nopponent. He trained his guns on Hector's ship, then hesitated with\nhis hand poised above the firing button.\n\n_Don't kill him again_, he warned himself. _His mind can't accept\nanother defeat._\n\nBut Leoh's hand, almost of its own will, reached the button and\ntouched it lightly. Another gram of pressure and the guns would fire.\n\nIn that instant's hesitation. Hector pulled his crippled ship around\nand aimed at Leoh. The Watchman fired a searing blast that jarred\nLeoh's ship from end to end. Leoh's hand slammed down on the firing\nbutton, whether he intended to do it or not, he did not know.\n\nLeoh's shot raked Hector's ship but did not stop it. The two vehicles\nwere hurtling directly at each other. Leoh tried desperately to avert\na collision, but Hector bored in grimly, matching Leoh's maneuvers\nwith his own.\n\nThe two ships smashed together and exploded.\n\nAbruptly, Leoh found himself in the cramped booth of the dueling\nmachine, his body cold and damp with perspiration, his hands\ntrembling.\n\nHe squeezed out of the booth and took a deep breath. Warm sunlight was\nstreaming into the high-vaulted room. The white walls glared\nbrilliantly. Through the tall windows he could see trees and people\nand clouds in the sky.\n\nHector walked up to him. For the first time in several days, the\nWatchman was smiling. Not much, but smiling. \"Well, we broke even on\nthat one.\"\n\nLeoh smiled back, somewhat shakily. \"Yes. It was ... quite an\nexperience. I've never died before.\"\n\nHector fidgeted, \"It's uh, not so bad, I guess--It does sort of, well,\nshatter you, you know.\"\n\n\"Yes I can see that now.\"\n\n\"Another duel?\" Hector asked, nodding his head toward the machine.\n\n\"Let's get out of this place for a few hours. Are you hungry?\"\n\n\"Starved.\"\n\nThey fought seven more duels over the next day and a half. Hector\nwon three of them. It was late afternoon when Leoh called a halt to\nthe tests.\n\n\"We can still get in another one or two,\" the Watchman pointed out.\n\n\"No need,\" Leoh said. \"I have all the data I require. Tomorrow Massan\nmeets Odal, unless we can put a stop to it. We have much to do before\ntomorrow morning.\"\n\nHector sagged into the couch. \"Just as well. I think I've aged seven\nyears in the past seven days.\"\n\n\"No, my boy,\" Leoh said gently. \"You haven't aged. You've matured.\"\n\n\nIX\n\nIt was deep twilight when the groundcar slid to a halt on its cushions\nof compressed air before the Kerak Embassy.\n\n\"I still think it's a mistake to go in there.\" Hector said. \"I mean,\nyou could've called him on the tri-di just as well, couldn't you?\"\n\nLeoh shook his head. \"Never give an agency of any government the\nopportunity to say 'hold the line a moment' and then huddle together\nto consider what to do with you. Nineteen times out of twenty, they'll\nend by passing your request up to the next higher echelon, and you'll\nbe left waiting for weeks.\"\n\n\"Still,\" Hector insisted, \"you're simply stepping into enemy\nterritory. It's a chance you shouldn't take.\"\n\n\"They wouldn't dare touch us.\"\n\nHector did not reply, but he looked unconvinced.\n\n\"Look,\" Leoh said, \"there are only two men alive who can shed light on\nthis matter. One of them is Dulaq, and his mind is closed to us for an\nindefinite time, Odal is the only other one who knows what happened.\"\n\nHector shook his head skeptically. Leoh shrugged, and opened the door\nof the groundcar. Hector had no choice but to get out and follow him\nas he walked up the pathway to the main entrance of the Embassy. The\nbuilding stood gaunt and gray in the dusk, surrounded by a\nprecisely-clipped hedge. The entrance was flanked by a pair of tall\nevergreen trees.\n\nLeoh and Hector were met just inside the entrance by a female\nreceptionist. She looked just a trifle disheveled--as though she had\nbeen rushed to the desk at a moment's notice. They asked for Odal,\nwere ushered into a sitting room, and within a few minutes--to\nHector's surprise--were informed by the girl that Major Odal would be\nwith them shortly.\n\n\"You see,\" Leoh pointed out jovially, \"when you come in person they\nhaven't as much of a chance to consider how to get rid of you.\"\n\nHector glanced around the windowless room and contemplated the thick,\nsolidly closed door. \"There's a lot of scurrying going on on the other\nside of that door, I'll bet. I mean ... they may be considering how\nto, uh, get rid of us ... permanently.\"\n\nLeoh shook his head, smiling wryly. \"Undoubtedly the approach closest\nto their hearts--but highly improbable in the present situation. They\nhave been making most efficient and effective use of the dueling\nmachine to gain their ends.\"\n\nOdal picked this moment to open the door.\n\n\"Dr. Leoh ... Lt. Hector ... you asked to see me?\"\n\n\"Thank you, Major Odal; I hope you will be able to help me,\" Leoh\nsaid. \"You are the only man living who may be able to give us some\nclues to the failure of the Dueling Machine.\"\n\nOdal's answering smile reminded Leoh of the best efforts of the\nrobot-puppet designers to make a machine that smiled like a man. \"I\nam afraid I can be of no assistance, Dr. Leoh. My experiences in the\nmachine are ... private.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you don't fully understand the situation,\" Leoh said. \"In the\npast week, we have tested the dueling machine here on Acquatainia\nexhaustively. We have learned that its performance can be greatly\ninfluenced by a man's personality, and by training. You have fought\nmany duels in the machines. Your background of experience, both as a\nprofessional soldier and in the machines, gives you a decided\nadvantage over your opponents.\n\n\"However, even with all this considered, I am convinced that you\ncannot kill a man in the machine--under normal circumstances. We have\ndemonstrated that fact in our tests. An unsabotaged machine cannot\ncause actual physical harm.\n\n\"Yet you have already killed one man and incapacitated another. Where\nwill it stop?\"\n\nOdal's face remained calm, except for the faintest glitter of fire\ndeep in his eyes. His voice was quiet, but had the edge of a\nwell-honed blade to it: \"I cannot be blamed for my background and\nexperience. And I have not tampered with your machines.\"\n\nThe door to the room opened, and a short, thick-set, bullet-headed man\nentered. He was dressed in a dark street suit, so that it was\nimpossible to guess his station at the Embassy.\n\n\"Would the gentlemen care for refreshments?\" he asked in a low-pitched\nvoice.\n\n\"No, thank you,\" Leoh said.\n\n\"Some Kerak wine, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Well--\"\n\n\"I don't, uh, think we'd better, sir,\" Hector said. \"Thanks all the\nsame.\"\n\nThe man shrugged and sat at a chair next to the door.\n\nOdal turned back to Leoh. \"Sir, I have my duty. Massan and I duel\ntomorrow. There is no possibility of postponing it.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" Leoh said. \"Will you at least allow us to place some\nspecial instrumentation into the booth with you, so that we can\nmonitor the duel more fully? We can do the same with Massan. I know\nthe duels are normally private and you would be within your legal\nrights to refuse the request. But, morally--\"\n\nThe smile returned to Odal's face. \"You wish to monitor my thoughts.\nTo record them and see how I perform during the duel. Interesting.\nVery interesting--\"\n\nThe man at the door rose and said, \"If you have no desire for\nrefreshments, gentlemen--\"\n\nOdal turned to him. \"Thank you for your attention.\"\n\nTheir eyes met and locked for an instant. The man give a barely\nperceptible shake of his head, then left.\n\nOdal returned his attention to Leoh, \"I am sorry, professor, but I\ncannot allow you to monitor my thoughts during the duel.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"I regret having to refuse you. But, as you yourself pointed out,\nthere is no legal requirement for such a course of action. I must\nrefuse. I hope you understand.\"\n\nLeoh rose from the couch, and Hector popped up beside him. \"I'm afraid\nI do understand. And I, too, regret your decision.\"\n\nOdal escorted them out to their car. They drove away, and the Kerak\nmajor walked slowly back into the Embassy building. He was met in the\nhallway by the dark-suited man who had sat in on the conversation.\n\n\"I could have let them monitor my thoughts and still crush Massan,\"\nOdal said. \"It would have been a good joke on them.\"\n\nThe man grunted. \"I have just spoken to the Chancellor on the tri-di,\nand obtained permission to make a slight adjustment in our plans.\"\n\n\"An adjustment, Minister Kor?\"\n\n\"After your duel tomorrow, your next opponent will be the eminent Dr.\nLeoh,\" Kor said.\n\n\nX\n\nThe mists swirled deep and impenetrable about Fernd Massan. He stared\nblindly through the useless viewplate in his helmet, then reached up\nslowly and carefully to place the infrared detector before his eyes.\n\n_I never realized an hallucination could seem so real_, Massan\nthought.\n\nSince the challenge by Odal, he realized, the actual world had seemed\nquite unreal. For a week, he had gone through the motions of life, but\nfelt as though he were standing aside, a spectator mind watching its\nown body from a distance. The gathering of his friends and associates\nlast night, the night before the duel--that silent, funereal group of\npeople--it had seemed completely unreal to him.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nBut now, in this manufactured dream, he seemed vibrantly alive. Every\nsensation was solid, stimulating. He could feel his pulse throbbing\nthrough him. Somewhere out in those mists, he knew, was Odal. And the\nthought of coming to grips with the assassin filled him with a strange\nsatisfaction.\n\nMassan had spent a good many years serving his government on the rich\nbut inhospitable high-gravity planets of the Acquataine Cluster. This\nwas the environment he had chosen: crushing gravity; killing\npressures; atmosphere of ammonia and hydrogen, laced with free\nradicals of sulphur and other valuable but deadly chemicals; oceans of\nliquid methane and ammonia; \"solid ground\" consisting of quickly\ncrumbling, eroding ice; howling superpowerful winds that could pick up\na mountain of ice and hurl it halfway around the planet; darkness;\ndanger; death.\n\nHe was encased in a one-man protective outfit that was half armored\nsuit, half vehicle. There was an internal grav field to keep him\ncomfortable in 3.7 gees, but still the suit was cumbersome, and a man\ncould move only very slowly in it, even with the aid of servomotors.\n\nThe weapon he had chosen was simplicity itself--a hand-sized capsule\nof oxygen. But in a hydrogen/ammonia atmosphere, oxygen could be a\ndeadly explosive. Massan carried several of these \"bombs\"; so did\nOdal. _But the trick_, Massan thought to himself, _is to know how to\nthrow them under these conditions; the proper range, the proper\ntrajectory. Not an easy thing to learn, without years of experience._\n\nThe terms of the duel were simple: Massan and Odal were situated on a\nrough-topped iceberg that was being swirled along one of the\nmethane/ammonia ocean's vicious currents. The ice was rapidly\ncrumbling; the duel would end when the iceberg was completely broken\nup.\n\nMassan edged along the ragged terrain. His suit's grippers and rollers\nautomatically adjusted to the roughness of the topography. He\nconcentrated his attention on the infrared detector that hung before\nhis viewplate.\n\nA chunk of ice the size of a man's head sailed through the murky\natmosphere in a steep glide peculiar to heavy gravity and banged into\nthe shoulder of Massan's suit. The force was enough to rock him\nslightly off-balance before the servos readjusted. Massan withdrew his\narm from the sleeve and felt the inside of the shoulder seam. _Dented,\nbut not penetrated._ A leak would have been disastrous, possibly\nfatal. Then he remembered: _Of course--I cannot be killed except by\ndirect action of my antagonist. That is one of the rules of the game._\n\nStill, he carefully fingered the dented shoulder to make certain it\nwas not leaking. The dueling machine and its rules seemed so very\nremote and unsubstantial, compared to this freezing, howling inferno.\n\nHe diligently set about combing the iceberg, determined to find Odal\nand kill him before their floating island disintegrated. He thoroughly\nexplored every projection, every crevice, every slope, working his way\nslowly from one end of the 'berg toward the other. Back and forth,\ncross and re-cross, with the infrared sensors scanning three hundreds\nsixty-degrees around him.\n\nIt was time-consuming. Even with the suit's servomotors and propulsion\nunits, motion across the ice, against the buffeting wind, was a\ncumbersome business. But Massan continued to work his way across the\niceberg, fighting down a gnawing, growing fear that Odal was not there\nat all.\n\nAnd then he caught just the barest flicker of a shadow on his\ndetector. Something, or someone, had darted behind a jutting rise of\nthe ice, off by the edge of the iceberg.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSlowly and carefully, Massan made his way toward the base of the rise.\nHe picked one of the oxy-bombs from his belt and held it in his\nright-hand claw.\n\nMassan edged around the base of the ice cliff, and stood on a narrow\nledge between the cliff and the churning sea. He saw no one. He\nextended the detector's range to maximum, and worked the scanners up\nthe sheer face of the cliff toward the top.\n\nThere he was! The shadowy outline of a man etched itself on the\ndetector screen. And at the same time, Massan heard a muffled roar,\nthen a rumbling, crashing noise, growing quickly louder and more\nmenacing.\n\nHe looked up the face of the ice cliff and saw a small avalanche of\nice tumbling, sliding, growling toward him. _That devil set off a bomb\nat the top of the cliff!_\n\nMassan tried to back out of the way, but it was too late. The first\nchunk of ice bounced harmlessly off his helmet, but the others knocked\nhim off-balance so repeatedly that the servos had no chance to\nrecover. He staggered blindly for a few moments, as more and more ice\ncascaded down on him, and then toppled off the ledge into the boiling\nsea.\n\nRelax! he ordered himself. _Do not panic! The suit will float you. The\nservos will keep you right-side-up. You cannot be killed accidentally;\nOdal must perform the coup-de-grace himself._\n\nThen he remembered the emergency rocket units in the back of his suit.\nIf he could orient himself properly, a touch of a control stud on his\nbelt would set them off, and he would be boosted back onto the\niceberg. He turned slightly inside the suit and tried to judge the\niceberg's distance through the infrared detector. It was difficult,\nespecially since he was bobbing madly in the churning currents.\n\nFinally he decided to fire the rocket and make final adjustments of\ndistance and landing site after he was safely out of the sea.\n\nBut he could not move his hand.\n\nHe tried, but his entire right arm was locked fast. He could not budge\nit an inch. And the same for the left. Something, or someone, was\nclamping his arms tight. He could not even pull them out of their\nsleeves.\n\nMassan thrashed about, trying to shake off whatever it was. No use.\n\nThen his detector screen was lifted slowly from the viewplate. He\nfelt something vibrating on his helmet. The oxygen tubes! They were\nbeing disconnected.\n\nHe screamed and tried to fight free. No use. With a hiss, the oxygen\ntubes pulled free of his helmet. Massan could feel the blood pounding\nthrough his veins as he fought desperately to free himself.\n\nNow he was being pushed down into the sea. He screamed again and tried\nto wrench his body away. The frothing sea filled his viewplate. He was\nunder. He was being held under. And now ... now the viewplate itself\nwas being loosened.\n\n_No! Don't!_ The scalding cold methane ammonia sea seeped in through\nthe opening viewplate.\n\n\"It's only a dream!\" Massan shouted to himself. \"Only a dream. A\ndream. A--\"\n\n\nXI\n\nDr. Leoh stared at the dinner table without really seeing it. Coming\nto the restaurant had been Hector's idea. Three hours earlier, Massan\nhad been removed from the dueling machine--dead.\n\nLeoh sat stolidly, hands in lap, his mind racing in many different\ndirections at once. Hector was off at the phone, getting the latest\ninformation from the meditechs. Odal had expressed his regrets\nperfunctorily, and then left for the Kerak Embassy, under a heavy\nescort of his own plainclothes guards. The government of the\nAcquataine Cluster was quite literally falling apart, with no man\nwilling to assume responsibility ... and thereby expose himself. One\nhour after the duel, Kanus' troops had landed on all the major planets\nof the Szarno Confederacy; the annexation was a _fait accompli_.\n\n_And what have I done since I arrived on Acquatainia?_ Leoh demanded\nof himself. _Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I have sat back like a\ndoddering old professor and played academic games with the machine,\nwhile younger, more vigorous men have USED the machine to suit their\npurposes._\n\nUsed the machine. There was a fragment of an idea in that phrase.\nSomething nebulous, that must be approached carefully or it will fade\naway. Used the machine, ... used it ... Leoh toyed with the phrase for\na few moments then gave it up with a sigh of resignation. _Lord, I'm\ntoo tired even to think._\n\nLeoh focused his attention on his surroundings and scanned the busy\ndining room. It was a beautiful place, really; decorated with crystal\nand genuine woods and fabric draperies. Not a synthetic in sight. The\nwaiters and cooks and busboys were humans, not the autocookers and\nservers that most restaurants employed. Leoh suddenly felt touched at\nHector's attempt to restore his spirits--even if it was being done at\nStar Watch expense.\n\nHe saw the young Watchman approaching the table, coming back from the\nphone. Hector bumped two waiters and stumbled over a chair before\nreaching the relative safety of his own seat.\n\n\"What's the verdict?\" Leoh asked.\n\nHector's lean face was bleak. \"Couldn't revive him. Cerebral\nhemorrhage, the meditechs said--induced by shock.\"\n\n\"Shock?\"\n\n\"That's what they said. Something must've, uh, overloaded his nervous\nsystem ... I guess.\"\n\nLeoh shook his head. \"I just don't understand any of this. I might as\nwell admit it. I'm no closer to an answer now than I was when I\narrived here. Perhaps I should have retired years ago, before the\ndueling machine was invented.\"\n\n\"Nonsense.\"\n\n\"No, I mean it.\" Leoh said. \"This is the first real intellectual\npuzzle I've had to contend with in years. Tinkering with machinery ...\nthat's easy. You know what you want, all you need is to make the\nmachinery perform properly. But this ... I'm afraid I'm too old to\nhandle a real problem like this.\"\n\nHector scratched his nose thoughtfully, then answered, \"If you can't\nhandle the problem, sir, then we're going to have a war on our hands\nin a matter of weeks. I mean, Kanus won't be satisfied with swallowing\nthe Szarno group ... the Acquataine Cluster is next ... and he'll have\nto fight to get it.\"\n\n\"Then the Star Watch can step in,\" Leoh said, resignedly.\n\n\"Maybe ... but it'll take time to mobilize the Star Watch ... Kanus\ncan move a lot faster than we can. Sure, we could throw in a task\nforce ... a token group, that is. But Kanus' gang will chew them up\npretty quick. I ... I'm no politician, sir, but I think I can see what\nwill happen. Kerak will gobble up the Acquataine Cluster ... a Star\nWatch task force will be wiped out in the battle ... and we'll end up\nwith Kerak at war with the Terran Commonwealth. And it'll be a real\nwar ... a big one.\"\n\nLeoh began to answer, then stopped. His eyes were fixed on the far\nentrance of the dining room. Suddenly every murmur in the busy room\nstopped dead. Waiters stood still between tables. Eating, drinking,\nconversation hung suspended.\n\nHector turned in his chair and saw at the far entrance the slim,\nstiff, blue-uniformed figure of Odal.\n\nThe moment of silence passed. Everyone turned to his own business and\navoided looking at the Kerak major. Odal, with a faint smile on his\nthin face, made his way slowly to the table where Hector and Leoh were\nsitting.\n\nThey rose to greet him and exchanged perfunctory salutations. Odal\npulled up a chair and sat with them.\n\n\"I assume that you've been looking for me,\" Leoh said. \"What do you\nwish to say?\"\n\nBefore Odal could answer, the waiter assigned to the table walked up,\ntook a position where his back would be to the Kerak major, and asked\nfirmly, \"Your dinner is ready gentlemen. Shall I serve it now?\"\n\nLeoh hesitated a moment, then asked Odal, \"Will you join us?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid not.\"\n\n\"Serve it now,\" Hector said. \"The major will be leaving shortly.\"\n\nAgain the tight grin broke across Odal's face. The waiter bowed and\nleft.\n\n\"I have been thinking about our conversation of last night,\" Odal said\nto Leoh.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"You accused me of cheating in my duels.\"\n\nLeoh's eyebrows arched. \"I said someone was cheating, yes--\"\n\n\"An accusation is an accusation.\"\n\nLeoh said nothing.\n\n\"Do you withdraw your words, or do you still accuse me of deliberate\nmurder? I am willing to allow you to apologize and leave Acquatainia\nin peace.\"\n\nHector cleared his throat noisily. \"This is no place to have an\nargument ... besides, here comes our dinner.\"\n\nOdal ignored the Watchman. \"You heard me, professor. Will you leave?\nOr do you accuse me of murdering Massan this afternoon?\"\n\n\"I--\"\n\nHector banged his fist on the table and jerked up out of his\nchair--just as the waiter arrived with a large tray of food. There was\na loud crash. A tureen of soup, two bowls of salad, glasses, assorted\nrolls, vegetables, cheeses and other delicacies cascaded over Odal.\n\nThe Kerak major leaped to his feet, swearing violently in his native\ntongue. He sputtered back into basic Terran: \"You clumsy, stupid oaf!\nYou maggot-brained misbegotten peasant-faced--\"\n\nHector calmly picked a salad leaf from the sleeve of his tunic. Odal\nabruptly stopped his tirade.\n\n\"I am clumsy,\" Hector said, grinning. \"As for being stupid, and the\nrest of it, I resent that. I am highly insulted.\"\n\nA flash of recognition lighted Odal's eyes. \"I see. Of course. My\nquarrel here is not with you. I apologize.\" He turned back to Leoh,\nwho was also standing now.\n\n\"Not good enough,\" Hector said. \"I don't, uh, like the ... tone of\nyour apology.\"\n\nLeoh raised a hand, as if to silence the younger man.\n\n\"I apologized; that is sufficient.\" Odal warned.\n\nHector took a step toward Odal. \"I guess I could insult your glorious\nleader, or something like that ... but this seems more direct.\" He\ntook the water pitcher from the table and poured it calmly and\ncarefully over Odal's head.\n\nA wave of laughter swept the room. Odal went white. \"You are\ndetermined to die.\" He wiped the dripping water from his eyes. \"I will\nmeet you before the week is out. And you have saved no one.\" He turned\non his heel and stalked out.\n\n\"Do you realize what you've done?\" Leoh asked, aghast.\n\nHector shrugged. \"He was going to challenge you--\"\n\n\"He will still challenge me, after you're dead.\"\n\n\"Uu-m-m, yes, well, maybe so. I guess you're right--Well, anyway,\nwe've gained a little more time.\"\n\n\"Four days.\" Leoh shook his head. \"Four days to the end of the week.\nAll right, come on, we have work to do.\"\n\nHector was grinning broadly as they left the restaurant. He began to\nwhistle.\n\n\"What are you so happy about?\" Leoh grumbled.\n\n\"About you, sir. When we came in here, you were, uh, well ... almost\nbeaten. Now you're right back in the game again.\"\n\nLeoh glanced at the Star Watchman. \"In your own odd way, Hector,\nyou're quite a boy ... I think.\"\n\n\nXII\n\nTheir groundcar glided from the parking building to the restaurant's\nentrance ramp, at the radio call of the doorman. Within minutes,\nHector and Leoh were cruising through the city, in the deepening\nshadows of night.\n\n\"There's only one man,\" Leoh said, \"who has faced Odal and lived\nthrough it.\"\n\n\"Dulaq,\" Hector agreed. \"But ... for all the information the medical\npeople have been able to get from him, he might as well be, uh, dead.\"\n\n\"He's still completely withdrawn?\"\n\nHector nodded. \"The medicos think that ... well, maybe in a few\nmonths, with drugs and psychotherapy and all that ... they might be\nable to bring him back.\"\n\n\"It won't be soon enough. We've only got four days.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\nLeoh was silent for several minutes. Then: \"Who is Dulaq's closest\nliving relative? Does he have a wife?\"\n\n\"I think his wife is, uh, dead. Has a daughter though. Pretty girl.\nBumped into her in the hospital once or twice--\"\n\nLeoh smiled in the darkness. Hector's term, \"bumped into\" was probably\ncompletely literal.\n\n\"Why are you asking about Dulaq's next-of-kin?\"\n\n\"Because,\" Leoh replied, \"I think there might be a way to make Dulaq\ntell us what happened during his duel. But it is a very dangerous way.\nPerhaps a fatal way.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nThey lapsed into silence again. Finally he blurted, \"Come on, my boy,\nlet's find the daughter and talk to her.\"\n\n\"Tonight?\"\n\n\"Now.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_She certainly is a pretty girl_, Leoh thought as he explained very\ncarefully to Geri Dulaq what he proposed to do. She sat quietly and\npolitely in the spacious living room of the Dulaq residence. The\nglittering chandelier cast touches of fire on her chestnut hair. Her\nslim body was slightly rigid with tension, her hands were clasped in\nher lap. Her face--which looked as though it could be very\nexpressive--was completely serious now.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"And that is the sum of it,\" Leoh concluded. \"I believe that it will\nbe possible to use the dueling machine itself to examine your father's\nthoughts and determine exactly what took place during his duel against\nMajor Odal!\"\n\nShe asked softly, \"But you are afraid that the shock might be\nrepeated, and this could be fatal to my father?\"\n\nLeoh nodded wordlessly.\n\n\"Then I am very sorry, sir, but I must say no.\" Firmly.\n\n\"I understand your feelings,\" Leoh replied, \"but I hope you realize\nthat unless we can stop Odal and Kanus immediately, we may very well\nbe faced with war.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"I know. But you must remember that we are speaking of my\nfather, of his very life. Kanus will have his war in any event, no\nmatter what I do.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" Leoh admitted. \"Perhaps.\"\n\nHector and Leoh drove back to the University campus and their quarters\nin the dueling machine chamber. Neither of them slept well that night.\n\nThe next morning, after an unenthusiastic breakfast, they found\nthemselves standing in the antiseptic-white chamber, before the\nlooming, impersonal intricacy of the machine.\n\n\"Would you like to practice with it?\" Leoh asked.\n\nHector shook his head. \"Maybe later.\"\n\nThe phone chimed in Leoh's office. They both went in. Geri Dulaq's\nface showed on the tri-di screen.\n\n\"I have just heard the news. I did not know that Lieutenant Hector has\nchallenged Odal.\" Her face was a mixture of concern and reluctance.\n\n\"He challenged Odal,\" Leoh answered, \"to prevent the assassin from\nchallenging me.\"\n\n\"Oh--You are a very brave man, lieutenant.\"\n\nHector's face went through various contortions and slowly turned a\ndefinite red, but no words issued from his mouth.\n\n\"Have you reconsidered your decision?\" Leoh asked.\n\nThe girl closed her eyes briefly, then said flatly, \"I am afraid I\ncannot change my decision. My father's safety is my first\nresponsibility. I am sorry.\"\n\nThey exchanged a few meaningless trivialities--with Hector still\nthoroughly tongue-tied and ended the conversation on a polite but\nstrained note.\n\nLeoh rubbed his thumb across the phone switch for a moment, then\nturned to Hector. \"My boy, I think it would be a good idea for you to\ngo straight to the hospital and check on Dulaq's condition.\"\n\n\"But ... why--\"\n\n\"Don't argue, son. This could be vitally important.\"\n\nHector shrugged and left the office. Leoh sat down at his desk and\ndrummed his fingers on the top of it. Then he burst out of the office\nand began pacing the big chamber. Finally, even that was too\nconfining. He left the building and started stalking through the\ncampus. He walked past a dozen buildings, turned and strode as far as\nthe decorative fence that marked the end of the main campus, ignoring\nstudents and faculty alike.\n\n_Campuses are all alike_, he muttered to himself, _on every human\nplanet, for all the centuries there have been universities. There must\nbe some fundamental reason for it._\n\nLeoh was halfway back to the dueling machine facility when he spotted\nHector walking dazedly toward the same building. For once, the\nWatchman was not whistling. Leoh cut across some lawn and pulled up\nbeside the youth.\n\n\"Well?\" he asked.\n\nHector shook his head, as if to clear away an inner fog. \"How did you\nknow she'd be at the hospital?\"\n\n\"The wisdom of age. What happened?\"\n\n\"She kissed me. Right there in the hallway of the--\"\n\n\"Spare me the geography,\" Leoh cut in. \"What did she say?\"\n\n\"I bumped into her in the hallway. We, uh, started talking ... sort\nof. She seemed, well ... worried about me. She got upset. Emotional.\nYou know? I guess I looked pretty forlorn and frightened. I am ... I\nguess. When you get right down to it, I mean.\"\n\n\"You aroused her maternal instinct.\"\n\n\"I ... I don't think it was that ... exactly. Well, anyway, she said\nthat if I was willing to risk my life to save yours, she couldn't\nprotect her father any more. Said she was doing it out of selfishness,\nreally, since he's her only living relative. I don't believe she meant\nthat, but she said it anyway.\"\n\nThey had reached the building by now. Leoh grabbed Hector's arm and\nsteered him clear of a collision with the half-open door.\n\n\"She's agreed to let us put Dulaq in the dueling machine?\"\n\n\"Sort of.\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"The medical staff doesn't want him to be moved from the hospital ...\nespecially not back to here. She agrees with them.\"\n\nLeoh snorted. \"All right. In fact, so much the better. I'd rather not\nhave the Kerak people see us bring Dulaq to the dueling machine. So\ninstead, we shall smuggle the dueling machine to Dulaq!\"\n\n\nXIII\n\nThey plunged to work immediately. Leoh preferred not to inform the\nregular staff of the dueling machine about their plan, so he and\nHector had to work through the night and most of the next morning.\nHector barely understood what he was doing, but with Leoh's\nsupervision, he managed to dismantle part of the dueling machine's\ncentral network, insert a few additional black boxes that the\nprofessor had conjured up from the spare parts bins in the basement,\nand then reconstruct the machine so that it looked exactly the same as\nbefore they had started.\n\nIn between his frequent trips to oversee Hector's work, Leoh had\njury-rigged a rather bulky headset and a hand-sized override control\ncircuit.\n\nThe late morning sun was streaming through the tall windows when Leoh\nfinally explained it all to Hector.\n\n\"A simple matter of technological improvisation,\" he told the\nbewildered Watchman. \"You have installed a short-range transceiver\ninto the machine, and this headset is a portable transceiver for\nDulaq. Now he can sit in his hospital bed and still be 'in' the\ndueling machine.\"\n\nOnly the three most trusted members of the hospital staff were taken\ninto Leoh's confidence, and they were hardly enthusiastic about Leoh's\nplan.\n\n\"It is a waste of time,\" said the chief psychophysician, shaking his\nwhite-maned head vigorously. \"You cannot expect a patient who has\nshown no positive response to drugs and therapy to respond to your\nmachine.\"\n\nLeoh argued, Geri Dulaq coaxed. Finally the doctors agreed. With only\ntwo days remaining before Hector's duel with Odal, they began to probe\nDulaq's mind. Geri remained by her father's bedside while the three\ndoctors fitted the cumbersome transceiver to Dulaq's head and attached\nthe electrodes for the automatic hospital equipment that monitored his\nphysical condition. Hector and Leoh remained at the dueling machine,\ncommunicating with the hospital by phone.\n\nLeoh made a final check of the controls and circuitry, then put in the\nlast call to the tense little group in Dulaq's room. All was ready.\n\nHe walked out to the machine, with Hector beside him. Their footsteps\nechoed hollowly in the sepulchral chamber. Leoh stopped at the nearer\nbooth.\n\n\"Now remember,\" he said, carefully, \"I will be holding the emergency\ncontrol unit in my hand. It will stop the duel the instant I set it\noff. However, if something should go wrong, you must be prepared to\nact quickly. Keep a close watch on my physical condition; I've shown\nyou which instruments to check on the control board--\"\n\n\"Yes sir.\"\n\nLeoh nodded and took a deep breath. \"Very well then.\"\n\nHe stepped into the booth and sat down. The emergency control unit\nrested on a shelf at his side; he took it in his hands. He leaned back\nand waited for the semi-hypnotic effect to take hold. Dulaq's choice\nof this very city and the stat-wand were known. But beyond that,\neverything was locked and sealed in Dulaq's subconscious mind. Could\nthe machine reach into that subconscious, probe past the lock and seal\nof catatonia, and stimulate Dulaq's mind into repeating the duel?\n\nSlowly, lullingly, the dueling machine's imaginary yet very real mists\nenveloped Leoh. When the mists cleared, he was standing on the upper\npedestrian level of the main commercial street of the city. For a long\nmoment, everything was still.\n\n_Have I made contact? Whose eyes am I seeing with, my own or Dulaq's?_\n\nAnd then he sensed it--an amused, somewhat astonished marveling at the\nreality of the illusion. Dulaq's thoughts!\n\n_Make your mind a blank_, Leoh told himself. _Watch. Listen. Be\npassive._\n\nHe became a spectator, seeing and hearing the world through Dulaq's\neyes and ears as the Acquatainian Prime Minister advanced through his\nnightmarish ordeal. He felt the confusion, frustration, apprehension\nand growing terror as, time and again, Odal appeared in the\ncrowd--only to melt into someone else and escape.\n\nThe first part of the duel ended, and Leoh was suddenly buffeted by a\njumble of thoughts and impressions. Then the thoughts slowly cleared\nand steadied.\n\nLeoh saw an immense and totally barren plain. Not a tree, not a blade\nof grass; nothing but bare, rocky ground stretching in all directions\nto the horizon and a disturbingly harsh yellow sky. At his feet was\nthe weapon Odal had chosen. A primitive club.\n\nHe shared Dulaq's sense of dread as he picked up the club and hefted\nit. Off on the horizon he could see a tall, lithe figure holding a\nsimilar club walking toward him.\n\nDespite himself, Leoh could feel his own excitement. He had broken\nthrough the shock-created armor that Dulaq's mind had erected! Dulaq\nwas reliving the part of the duel that had caused the shock.\n\nReluctantly, he advanced to meet Odal. But as they drew closer\ntogether, the one figure of his opponent seemed to split apart. Now\nthere were two, four, six of them. Six Odals, six mirror images, all\narmed with massive, evil clubs, advancing steadily on him.\n\nSix tall, lean, blond assassins, with six cold smiles on their intent\nfaces.\n\nHorrified, completely panicked, he scrambled away, trying to evade the\nsix opponents with the half-dozen clubs raised and poised to strike.\n\nTheir young legs and lungs easily outdistanced him. A smash on his\nback sent him sprawling. One of them kicked his weapon away.\n\nThey stood over him for a malevolent, gloating second. Then six strong\narms flashed down, again and again, mercilessly. Pain and blood,\nscreaming agony, punctuated by the awful thudding of solid clubs\nhitting fragile flesh and bone, over and over again, endlessly.\n\nEverything went blank.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLeoh opened his eyes and saw Hector bending over him.\n\n\"Are you all right, sir?\"\n\n\"I ... I think so.\"\n\n\"The controls all hit the danger mark at once. You were ... well, sir,\nyou were screaming.\"\n\n\"I don't doubt it,\" Leoh said.\n\nThey walked, with Leoh leaning on Hector's arm, from the dueling\nmachine booth to the office.\n\n\"That was ... an experience.\" Leoh said, easing himself onto the\ncouch.\n\n\"What happened? What did Odal do? What made Dulaq go into shock? How\ndoes--\"\n\nThe old man silenced Hector with a wave of his hand, \"One question at\na time, please.\"\n\nLeoh leaned back on the deep couch and told Hector every detail of\nboth parts of the duel.\n\n\"Six Odals,\" Hector muttered soberly, leaning back against the\ndoorframe. \"Six against one.\"\n\n\"That's what he did. It's easy to see how a man expecting a polite,\nformal duel can be completely shattered by the viciousness of such an\nattack. And the machine amplifies every impulse, every sensation.\"\n\n\"But how does he do it?\" Hector asked, his voice suddenly loud and\ndemanding.\n\n\"I've been asking myself the same question. We've checked over the\ndueling machine time and again. There is no possible way for Odal to\nplug in five helpers ... unless--\"\n\n\"Unless?\"\n\nLeoh hesitated, seemingly debating with himself. Finally he nodded his\nhead sharply, and answered. \"Unless Odal is a telepath.\"\n\n\"Telepath? But--\"\n\n\"I know it sounds farfetched. But there have been well-documented\ncases of telepathy for centuries throughout the Commonwealth.\"\n\nHector frowned. \"Sure, everybody's heard about it ... natural\ntelepaths ... but they're so unpredictable ... I don't see how--\"\n\nLeoh leaned forward on the couch and clasped his hands in front of his\nchin. \"The Terran races have never developed telepathy, or any of the\nextrasensory talents. They never had to, not with tri-di\ncommunications and superlight starships. But perhaps the Kerak people\nare different--\"\n\nHector shook his head. \"If they had uh, telepathic abilities, they\nwould be using them everywhere. Don't you think?\"\n\n\"Probably so. But only Odal has shown such an ability, and only ...\n_of course!_\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Odal has shown telepathic ability only in the dueling machine.\"\n\n\"As far as we know.\"\n\n\"Certainly. But look, supposed he's a natural telepath ... the same as\na Terran. He has an erratic, difficult-to-control talent. Then he gets\ninto a dueling machine. The machine amplifies his thoughts. And it\nalso amplifies his talent!\"\n\n\"Ohhh.\"\n\n\"You see ... outside the machine, he's no better than any wandering\nfortuneteller. But the dueling machine gives his natural abilities the\namplification and reproducibility that they could never have unaided.\"\n\nHector nodded.\n\n\"So it's fairly straightforward matter for him to have five associates\nin the Kerak Embassy sit in on the duel, so to speak. Possibly they\nare natural telepaths also, but they needn't be.\"\n\n\"They just, uh, pool their minds with his, hm-m-m? Six men show in the\nduel ... pretty nasty.\" Hector dropped into the desk chair.\n\n\"So what do we do now?\"\n\n\"Now?\" Leoh blinked at his young friend. \"Why ... I suppose the first\nthing we should do is call the hospital and see how Dulaq came\nthrough.\"\n\nLeoh put the call through. Geri Dulaq's face appeared on the screen.\n\n\"How's your father?\" Hector blurted.\n\n\"The duel was too much for him,\" she said blankly. \"He is dead.\"\n\n\"No,\" Leoh groaned.\n\n\"I ... I'm sorry,\" Hector said. \"I'll be right down there. Stay where\nyou are.\"\n\nThe young Star Watchman dashed out of the office as Geri broke the\nphone connection. Leoh stared at the blank screen for a few moments,\nthen leaned far back in the couch and closed his eyes. He was suddenly\nexhausted, physically and emotionally. He fell asleep, and dreamed of\nmen dead and dying.\n\nHector's nerve-shattering whistling woke him up. It was full night\noutside.\n\n\"What are you so happy about?\" Leoh groused as Hector popped into the\noffice.\n\n\"Happy? Me?\"\n\n\"You were whistling.\"\n\nHector shrugged. \"I always whistle, sir. Doesn't mean I'm happy.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Leoh said, rubbing his eyes. \"How did the girl take her\nfather's death?\"\n\n\"Pretty hard. Cried a lot.\"\n\nLeoh looked at the younger man. \"Does she blame ... me?\"\n\n\"You? Why, no sir. Why should she? Odal ... Kanus ... the Kerak\nWorlds. But not you.\"\n\nThe old professor sighed, relieved. \"Very well. Now then, we have much\nwork to do, and little more than a day in which to finish it.\"\n\n\"What do you want me to do?\" Hector asked.\n\n\"Phone the Star Watch Commander--\"\n\n\"My commanding officer, all the way back at Alpha Perseus VI? That's a\nhundred light-years from here.\"\n\n\"No, no, no.\" Leoh shook his head. \"The Commander-in-Chief, Sir Harold\nSpencer. At Star Watch Central Headquarters. That's several hundred\nparsecs from here. But get through to him as quickly as possible.\"\n\nWith a low whistle of astonishment, Hector began punching buttons on\nthe phone switch.\n\n\nXIV\n\nThe morning of the duel arrived, and precisely at the agreed-upon\nhour, Odal and a small retinue of Kerak representatives stepped though\nthe double doors of the dueling machine chamber.\n\nHector and Leoh were already there, waiting. With them stood another\nman dressed in the black-and-silver of the Star Watch. He was a\nblocky, broad-faced veteran with iron-gray hair and hard, unsmiling\neyes.\n\nThe two little groups of men knotted together in the center of the\nroom, before the machine's control board. The white-uniformed staff\nmeditechs emerged from a far doorway and stood off to one side.\n\nOdal went through the formality of shaking hands with Hector. The\nKerak major nodded toward the other Watchman. \"Your replacement?\" he\nasked mischievously.\n\nThe chief meditech stepped between them. \"Since you are the challenged\nparty, Major Odal, you have the first choice of weapon and\nenvironment. Are there any instructions or comments necessary before\nthe duel begins?\"\n\n\"I think not,\" Odal replied. \"The situation will be self-explanatory.\nI assume, of course, that Star Watchmen are trained to be warriors and\nnot merely technicians. The situation I have chosen is one in which\nmany warriors have won glory.\"\n\nHector said nothing.\n\n\"I intend,\" Leoh said firmly, \"to assist the staff in monitoring this\nduel. Your aides may, of course, sit at the control board with me.\"\n\nOdal nodded.\n\n\"If you are ready to begin, gentleman,\" the chief meditech said.\n\nHector and Odal went to their booths. Leoh sat at the control console,\nand one of the Kerak men sat down next to him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHector felt every nerve and muscle tensed as he sat in the booth,\ndespite his efforts to relax. Slowly the tension eased, and he began\nto feel slightly drowsy. The booth seemed to melt away....\n\nHe was standing on a grassy meadow. Off in the distance were wooded\nhills. A cool breeze was hustling puffy clouds across the calm blue\nsky.\n\nHector heard a snuffling noise behind him, and wheeled around. He\nblinked, then stared.\n\nIt had four legs, and was evidently a beast of burden. At least, it\ncarried a saddle on its back. Piled atop the saddle was a\nconglomeration of which looked to Hector--at first glance--like a pile\nof junk. He went over to the animal and examined it carefully. The\n\"junk\" turned out to be a long spear, various pieces of armor, a\nhelmet, sword, shield, battle-ax and dagger.\n\n_The situation I have chosen is one in which many warriors have won\nglory._ Hector puzzled over the assortment of weapons. They came\nstraight out of Kerak's Dark Ages. No doubt Odal had been practicing\nwith them for months, even years. He may not need five helpers.\n\nWarily, Hector put on the armor. The breastplate seemed too big, and\nhe was somehow unable to tighten the greaves on his shins properly.\nThe helmet fit over his head like an ancient oil can, flattening his\nears and nose and forcing him to squint to see through the narrow\neye-slit.\n\nFinally, he buckled on the sword and found attachments on the saddle\nfor the other weapons. The shield was almost too heavy to lift, and he\nbarely struggled into the saddle with all the weight he was carrying.\n\nAnd then he just sat. He began to feel a little ridiculous. _Suppose\nit rains?_ he wondered. But of course it wouldn't.\n\nAfter an interminable wait, Odal appeared, on a powerful trotting\ncharger. His armor was black as space, and so was his animal.\n_Naturally_, Hector thought.\n\nOdal saluted gravely with his great spear from across the meadow.\nHector returned the salute, nearly dropping his spear in the process.\n\nThen, Odal lowered the spear and aimed it--so it seemed to\nHector--directly at the Watchman's ribs. He pricked his mount into a\ncanter. Hector did the same, and his steed jogged into a bumping,\njolting gallop. The two warriors hurtled toward each other from\nopposite ends of the meadow.\n\nAnd suddenly there were six black figured roaring down on Hector!\n\nThe Watchman's stomach wrenched within him. Automatically he tried to\nturn his mount aside. But the beast had no intention of going anywhere\nexcept straight ahead. The Kerak warriors bore in, six abreast, with\nsix spears aimed menacingly.\n\nAbruptly, Hector heard the pounding of other hoof-beats right beside\nhim. Through a corner of his helmet-slit he glimpsed at least two\nother warriors charging with him into Odal's crew.\n\nLeoh's gamble had worked. The transceiver that had allowed Dulaq to\nmake contact with the dueling machine from his hospital bed was now\nallowing five Star Watch officers to join Hector, even though they\nwere physically sitting in a starship orbiting high above the planet.\n\nThe odds were even now. The five additional Watchmen were the\nroughest, hardiest, most aggressive man-to-man fighters that the Star\nWatch could provide on a one-day notice.\n\nTwelve powerful chargers met head on, and twelve strong men smashed\ntogether with an ear-splitting CLANG! Shattered spears showered\nsplinters everywhere. Men and animals went down.\n\nHector was rocked back in his saddle, but somehow managed to avoid\nfalling off.\n\nOn the other hand, he could not really regain his balance, either.\nDust and weapons filled the air. A sword hissed near his head and\nrattled off his shield.\n\nWith a supreme effort. Hector pulled out his own sword and thrashed at\nthe nearest rider. It turned out to be a fellow Watchman, but the\nstroke bounced harmlessly off his helmet.\n\nIt was so confusing. The wheeling, snorting animals. Clouds of dust.\nScreaming, raging men. A black-armored rider charged into Hector,\nwaving a battle-ax over his head. He chopped savagely, and the\nWatchmans's shield split apart. Another frightening swing--Hector\ntried to duck and slid completely out of the saddle, thumping\npainfully on the ground, while the ax cleaved the air where his head\nhad been a split-second earlier.\n\nSomehow his helmet had been turned around. Hector tried to decide\nwhether to thrash around blindly or lay down his sword and straighten\nout the helmet. The problem was solved for him by the _crang!_ of a\nsword against the back of his helmet. The blow flipped him into a\nsomersault, but also knocked the helmet completely off his head.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHector climbed painfully to his feet, his head spinning. It took him\nseveral moments to realize that the battle had stopped. The dust\ndrifted away, and he saw that all the Kerak fighters were down--except\none. The black-armored warrior took off his helmet and tossed it\naside. It was Odal. Or was it? They all looked alike. _What difference\ndoes it make?_ Hector wondered. _Odal's mind is the dominant one._\n\nOdal stood, legs braced apart, sword in hand, and looked uncertainly\nat the other Star Watchman. Three of them were afoot and two still\nmounted. The Kerak assassin seemed as confused as Hector felt. The\nshock of facing equal numbers had sapped much of his confidence.\n\nCautiously he advanced toward Hector, holding his sword out before\nhim. The other Watchmen stood aside while Hector slowly backpedaled,\nstumbling slightly on the uneven ground.\n\nOdal feinted and cut at Hector's arm. The Watchman barely parried in\ntime. Another feint, at the head, and a slash into the chest; Hector\nmissed the parry but his armor saved him. Grimly, Odal kept advancing.\nFeint, feint, crack! and Hector's sword went flying from his hand.\n\nFor the barest instant everyone froze. Then Hector leaped desperately\nstraight at Odal, caught him completely by surprise, and wrestled him\nto the ground. The Watchman pulled the sword from his opponent's hand\nand tossed it away. But with his free hand, Odal clouted Hector on the\nside of the head and knocked him on his back. Both men scrambled up\nand ran for the nearest weapons.\n\nOdal picked up a wicked-looking double-bladed ax. One of the mounted\nStar Watchmen handed Hector a huge broadsword. He gripped it with both\nhands, but still staggered off-balance as he swung it up over his\nshoulder.\n\nHolding the broadsword aloft, Hector charged toward Odal, who stood\ndogged, short-breathed, sweat-streaked, waiting for him. The\nbroadsword was quite heavy, even for a two handed grip. And Hector did\nnot notice his own battered helmet laying on the ground between them.\n\nOdal, for his part, had Hector's charge and swing timed perfectly in\nhis own mind. He would duck under the swing and bury his ax in the\nWatchman's chest. Then he would face the others. Probably with their\nleader gone, the duel would automatically end. But, of course, Hector\nwould not really be dead; the best Odal could hope for now was to win\nthe duel.\n\nHector charged directly into Odal's plan, but the Watchman's timing\nwas much poorer than anticipated. Just as he began the downswing of a\nmighty broadsword stroke, he stumbled on the helmet. Odal started to\nduck, then saw that the Watchman was diving face-first into the\nground, legs flailing, and that heavy broadsword was cleaving through\nthe air with a will of its own.\n\nOdal pulled back in confusion, only to have the wild-swinging\nbroadsword strike him just above the wrist. The ax dropped out of his\nhand, and Odal involuntarily grasped the wounded forearm with his left\nhand. Blood seeped through his fingers.\n\nHe shook his head in bitter resignation, turned his back on the\nprostrate Hector, and began walking away.\n\nSlowly, the scene faded, and Hector found himself sitting in the booth\nof the dueling machine.\n\n\nXV\n\nThe door opened and Leoh squeezed into the booth.\n\n\"You're all right?\"\n\nHector blinked and refocused his eyes on reality. \"Think so--\"\n\n\"Everything went well? The Watchmen got through to you?\"\n\n\"Good thing they did. I was nearly killed anyway.\"\n\n\"But you survived.\"\n\n\"So far.\"\n\nAcross the room, Odal stood massaging his forehead while Kor demanded:\n\"How could they possibly have discovered the secret? Where was the\nleak?\"\n\n\"That is not important now,\" Odal said quietly. \"The primary fact is\nthat they have not only discovered our secret, but they have found a\nway of duplicating it.\"\n\n\"The sanctimonious hypocrites,\" Kor snarled, \"accusing us of cheating,\nand then they do the same thing.\"\n\n\"Regardless of the moral values of our mutual behavior,\" Odal said\ndryly, \"it is evident that there is no longer any use in calling on\ntelepathically-guided assistants, I shall face the Watchman alone\nduring the second half of the duel.\"\n\n\"Can you trust them to do the same?\"\n\n\"Yes. They easily defeated my aides a few minutes ago, then stood\naside and allowed the two of us to fight by ourselves.\"\n\n\"And you failed to defeat him?\"\n\nOdal frowned, \"I was wounded by a fluke. He is a very ... unusual\nopponent. I cannot decide whether he is actually as clumsy as he\nappears to be, or whether he is shamming and trying to make me\noverconfident. Either way, it is impossible to predict his behavior.\nPerhaps he is also telepathic.\"\n\nKor's gray eyes became flat and emotionless. \"You know, of course, how\nthe Chancellor will react if you fail to kill this Watchman. Not\nmerely defeat him. He must be killed. The aura of invincibility must\nbe maintained.\"\n\n\"I will do my best,\" Odal said.\n\n\"He must be killed.\"\n\nThe chime that marked the end of the rest period sounded. Odal and\nHector returned to the their booths. Now it was Hector's choice of\nenvironment and weapons.\n\nOdal found himself enveloped in darkness. Only gradually did his eyes\nadjust. He saw that he was in a spacesuit. For several minutes he\nstood motionless, peering into the darkness, every sense alert, every\nmuscle coiled for immediate action.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nDimly he could see the outlines of jagged rock against a background of\ninnumerable stars. Experimentally, he lifted one foot. It stuck\ntackily, to the surface. _Magnetized boots_, Odal thought. _This must\nbe a planetoid._\n\nAs his eyes grew accustomed to the dimness, he saw that he was right.\nIt was a small planetoid, perhaps a mile or so in diameter. Almost\nzero gravity. Airless.\n\nOdal swiveled his head inside the fishbowl helmet of his spacesuit and\nsaw, over his right shoulder, the figure of Hector--lank and ungainly\neven with the bulky suit. For a moment, Odal puzzled over the weapon\nto be used. Then Hector bent down, picked up a loose stone,\nstraightened, and tossed it softly past Odal's head. The Kerak major\nwatched it sail by and off into the darkness of space, never to return\nto the tiny planetoid.\n\n_A warning shot_, Odal thought to himself. He wondered how much damage\none could do with a nearly weightless stone, then remembered that\ninertial mass was unaffected by gravitational fields, or the lack of\nthem. A fifty-pound rock might be easier to lift, but it would be just\nas hard to throw--and it would do just as much damage when it hit,\nregardless of its gravitational \"weight.\"\n\nOdal crouched down and selected a stone the size of his fist. He rose\ncarefully, sighted Hector standing a hundred yards or so away, and\nthrew as hard as he could.\n\nThe effort of his throw sent him tumbling off-balance, and the stone\nwas far off-target. He fell to his hands and knees, bounced lightly\nand skidded to a stop. Immediately he drew his feet up under his body\nand planted the magnetized soles of his boots firmly on the iron-rich\nsurface.\n\nBut before he could stand again, a small stone _pinged_ lightly off\nhis oxygen tank. The Star Watchman had his range already!\n\nOdal scrambled to the nearest upjutting rocks and crouched behind\nthem. _Lucky I didn't rip open the spacesuit_, he told himself. Three\nstones, evidently hurled in salvo, ticked off the top of the top of\nthe rocks he was hunched behind. One of the stones bounced into his\nfishbowl helmet.\n\nOdal scooped up a handful of pebbles and tossed them in Hector's\ngeneral direction. That should make him duck. Perhaps he'll stumble\nand crack his helmet open.\n\nThen he grinned to himself. That's it. Kor wants him dead, and that is\nthe way to do it. Pin him under a big rock, then bury him alive under\nmore rocks. A few at a time, stretched out nicely. While his oxygen\nsupply gives out. That should put enough stress on his nervous system\nto hospitalize him, at least. Then he can assassinated by more\nconventional means. Perhaps he will even be as obliging as Massan, and\nhave a fatal stroke.\n\nA large rock. One that is light enough to lift and throw, yet also big\nenough to pin him for a few moments. Once he is down, it will be easy\nenough to bury him under more rocks.\n\nThe Kerak major spotted a boulder of the proper size, a few yards\naway. He backed toward it, throwing small stones in Hector's direction\nto keep the Watchman busy. In return, a barrage of stones began\nstriking all around him. Several hit him, one hard enough to knock him\nslightly off-balance.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nSlowly, patiently, Odal reached his chosen weapon--an oblong boulder,\nabout the size of a small chair. He crouched behind it and tugged at\nit experimentally. It moved slightly. Another stone zinged off his\narm, hard enough to hurt. Odal could see Hector clearly now, standing\natop a small rise, calmly firing pellets at him. He smiled as he\ncoiled, catlike, and tensed himself. He gripped the boulder with his\narms and hands.\n\nThen in one vicious uncoiling motion he snatched it up, whirled\naround, and hurled it at Hector. The violence of his action sent him\ntottering awkwardly as he released the boulder. He fell to the ground,\nbut kept his eyes fixed on the boulder as it tumbled end over end,\ndirectly at the Watchman.\n\nFor an eternally-long instant Hector stood motionless, seemingly\nentranced. Then he leaped sideways, floating dreamlike in the low\ngravity, as the stone hurtled inexorably past him.\n\nOdal pounded his fist on the ground in fury. He started up, only to\nhave a good-sized stone slam against his shoulder, and knock him flat\nagain. He looked up in time to see Hector fire another. The stone\npuffed into the ground inches from Odal's helmet. The Kerak major\nflattened himself. Several more stones clattered on his helmet and\noxygen tank. Then silence.\n\nOdal looked up and saw Hector squatting down, reaching for more\nammunition. The Kerak warrior stood up quickly, his own fists filled\nwith throwing stones. He cocked his arm to throw--\n\nBut something made him turn to look behind him. The boulder loomed\nbefore his eyes, still tumbling slowly, as it had when he had thrown\nit. It was too close and too big to avoid. It smashed into Odal,\npicked him off his feet and slammed against the upjutting rocks a few\nyards away.\n\nEven before he started to feel the pain in his midsection, Odal began\ntrying to push the boulder off. But he could not get enough leverage.\nThen he saw the Star Watchman's form standing over him.\n\n\"I didn't really think you'd fall for it,\" Odal heard Hector's voice\nin his earphones. \"I mean ... didn't you realize that the boulder was\ntoo massive to escape completely after it had missed me? You could've\ncalculated its orbit ... you just threw it into a, uh, six-minute\norbit around the planetoid. It _had_ to come back to perigee ... right\nwhere you were standing when you threw it, you know.\"\n\nOdal said nothing, but strained every cell in his pain-wracked body to\nget free of the boulder. Hector reached over his shoulder and began\nfumbling with the valves that were pressed against the rocks.\n\n\"Sorry to do this ... but I'm not, uh, killing you, at least ... just\ndefeating you. Let's see ... one of these is the oxygen valve, and the\nother, I think, is the emergency rocket pack ... now, which is which?\"\nOdal felt the Watchman's hands searching for the proper valve. \"I\nshould've dreamed up suits without the rocket pack ... confuses things ...\nthere, that's it.\"\n\nHector's hand tightened on a valve and turned it sharply. The rocket\nroared to life and Odal was hurtled free of the boulder, shot\nuncontrolled completely off the planetoid. Hector was bowled over by\nthe blast and rolled halfway around the tiny chink of rock and metal.\n\nOdal tried to reach around to throttle down the rocket, but the pain\nin his body was too great. He was slipping into unconsciousness. He\nfought against it. He knew he must return to the planetoid and somehow\nkill the opponent. But gradually the pain overpowered him. His eyes\nwere closing, closing--\n\nAnd, quite abruptly, he found himself sitting in the booth of the\ndueling machine. It took a moment for him to realize that he was back\nin the real world. Then his thoughts cleared. He had failed to kill\nHector.\n\nAnd at the door of the booth stood Kor, his face a grim mask of anger.\n\n\nXVI\n\nThe office was that of the new prime minister of the Acquataine\nCluster. It had been loaned to Leoh for his conversation with Sir\nHarold Spencer. For the moment, it seemed like a great double room:\nhalf of it was dark, warm woods, rich draperies, floor-to-ceiling\nbookcases. The other half, from the tri-di screen onward, was the\naustere, metallic utility of a starship compartment.\n\nSpencer was saying, \"So this hired assassin, after killing four men\nand nearly wrecking a government, has returned to his native worlds.\"\n\nLeoh nodded. \"He returned under guard. I suppose he is in disgrace, or\nperhaps even under arrest.\"\n\n\"Servants of a dictator never know when they will be the ones who are\nserved--on a platter.\" Spencer chuckled. \"And the Watchman who\nassisted you, this Junior Lieutenant Hector, what of him?\"\n\n\"He's not here just now. The Dulaq girl has him in tow, somewhere.\nEvidently it's the first time he's been a hero--\"\n\nSpencer shifted his weight in his chair. \"I have long prided myself on\nthe conviction that any Star Watch officer can handle almost any kind\nof emergency anywhere in the galaxy. From your description of the past\nfew weeks, I was beginning to have my doubts. However, Junior\nLieutenant Hector seems to have won the day ... almost in spite of\nhimself.\"\n\n\"Don't underestimate him,\" Leoh said, smiling. \"He turned out to be an\nextremely valuable man. I think he will make a fine officer.\"\n\nSpencer grunted an affirmative.\n\n\"Well,\" Leoh said, \"that's the complete story, to date. I believe that\nOdal is finished. But the Kerak Worlds have made good their annexation\nof the Szarno Confederacy, and the Acquataine Cluster is still very\nwobbly, politically. We haven't heard the last of Kanus--not by a long\nshot.\"\n\nSpencer lifted a shaggy eyebrow. \"Neither,\" he rumbled, \"has he heard\nthe last from us.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Dueling Machine, by\nBenjamin William Bova and Myron R.

In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
