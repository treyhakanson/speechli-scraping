P. man penetrates the mystery of the dreaded \"Solar\nScourge.\"_]\n\n\nThe _Celestia_, gliding through space toward Titan, major satellite of\nSaturn, faltered in her course. Her passengers, mostly mining\nengineers and their wives, stockholders, and a sprinkling of visitors,\nwere aware of a cessation of the heavens' apparent gyrations, due to\nthe halting of the ship's rotation on its axis. At the same time the\nship's fictitious gravity, engendered by the centrifugal force of its\nrotation, ceased, so that passengers, most of whom were assembled in\nthe main salon, which occupied the entire midship section, drifted\naway from the curved floor, whose contour followed that of the outer\nskin, to flounder in helpless confusion.\n\nA woman screamed. A rasping sound, as of metal scraping against the\nhull, came from one point in the circumference, and here the portholes\nwere obscured by a dark mass that blotted out the stars.\n\nAn old man, clinging to a luxuriously upholstered chair, and pale with\nfright, cried:\n\n\"It's those damned pirates. If they find out who I am it'll break the\ncompany to ransom me.\"\n\n\"If the company thinks it worth while to ransom you,\" retorted his\nyoungish, saturnine companion, who seemed less scared than annoyed.\n\nQuestions darted back and forth. No word came from the control room\nforward, and little of what transpired outside could be seen through\nthe thick glass ports. The pirate ship loomed over them like a\nmonstrous leech, its bolts sharply etched in black and white by the\nsunlight from their stern. Beyond that was only the velvety\ndarkness--the absolute vacuity of space that carries no sound,\nrefracts no light. A battle was raging out there, but of that nothing\ncould be seen or heard in the salon. Only a dull, booming vibration\nthrough the flyer's hull, made by the rockets in a useless effort to\nshake off their captor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOf all the passengers, none understood the situation as well as Quirl\nFinner. In imagination he followed the desperate struggle that was\ngoing on out there, for the men who were selling their lives were his\ncompanions in arms, the ship's guard of the redoubtable I.F.P., the\nInterplanetary Flying Police who carried the law of white men to the\noutermost orbit of the solar system.\n\nQuirl bristled, but he maintained his pose of indifference--of the\nsightseeing passenger who depended blindly on the ship's crew for his\nown safety. In appearance he might easily have been the pampered son\nof some millionaire that he impersonated. His close-fitting silken\ntunic of blue, with its bright yellow roll-collar, the turban of fine\nyellow lace, the close-fitting trousers that showed his lithe yet\npowerfully molded legs, the thin-soled low boots--all proclaimed him\nthe typical time-killing dandy of the times. His superb proportions\nmade him look smaller, lighter than he really was, and his lean\nfeatures, which under the I.F.P. skullcap would have looked hawk-like,\nwere sufficiently like the patrician fineness of the character part he\nwas playing. Young men of means in the year 2159 were by no means\nwithout their good points. They indulged in athletic sports to\ncounteract the softening influence of idleness, and so Quirl Finner\nhad no misgivings about the success of his disguise.\n\nYet he could not refrain from listening intently for every sound that\npenetrated the hull. His part was to be captured by the pirate, who\nhad been named \"The Solar Scourge\" by sensational newscasters, and to\nlearn all he could, and eventually to be ransomed by a \"wealthy\nfather\" with his priceless information. So he waited, chafing, while\nmen he knew, men who had faced the perils of space with him, met their\ndeath.\n\nAfter a time there came the sudden crackling of the air-tight bulkhead\nwhich separated the salon from the forward sections. Quirl knew what\nthis meant. The pirates had succeeded in breaching a hole through the\nship's skin, and the air of the forward section had rushed into space.\nIt was sickening to think of those brave men up there caught in the\nsuddenly formed vacuum. Long before the bulkhead had ceased crackling\nhe knew they were dead, and that the pirate crew had entered, wearing\nvacuum suits, and was even then replenishing the air so the passengers\ncould be taken alive.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey had been in the prison hold of the pirate ship for five days,\nterrestrial time. This was nothing like the spacious quarters they had\noccupied before. A cross-section of their prison would have looked\nlike a wedge with a quarter circle for its blunt end. The curved wall\nof the great cylindrical projectile, nearly a hundred feet in\ndiameter, was their floor, on which they could walk like flies on the\ninside of a wheel rim. The walls of the room, on two sides, converged\ntoward the top, until they joined the sides of a well-like tunnel that\nran from the nose of the ship to its tail, where the rocket nozzles\nwere. A door pierced the tunnel side, and under this door was a metal\nplatform, from which one could either climb into the passage or down a\nladder into the hold. A pirate guard held this platform, from where he\ncould peer over the top of a curtain which gave scant privacy to the\nmen and women prisoners on either side of it.\n\nOn the floor-plates, without even the meager comfort of the dried\nMartian weeds that had been given to the women, sat or lay the men.\nThey showed their dejection, their faces covered with new growths of\nbeard, their clothes crumpled and torn. The only furniture consisted\nof a long, light metal table on the women's side, securely bolted to\nthe floor. The prisoners were obliged to stand at this when eating\ntheir meals. The whole cheerless scene was coldly illuminated by a\nsingle light-emanating disk just under the guard's platform.\n\nSteps echoed hollowly metallic from above. Quirl wondered if it was\nalready time for the galley boy to bring the immense bowl of hot stew\nfor the noon meal.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was not. It was Moby Gore, the huge and overbearing first mate of\nthe pirates on his daily mission of inspection and prisoner baiting.\nQuirl crept further into his corner. It would be fatal to his plan for\nhim to attract the attention of this petty tyrant. It was hard enough\nto keep away from him--to crush back the almost overwhelming desire to\nfly at him, fists hammering.\n\nGore came down the ladder deliberately, pausing on the lower steps to\nlook around with his little, pig's eyes. His head was set well forward\non his thick, muscular neck, so that he had to look out from under his\nbeetling brows in a manner peculiarly ape-like. His heavy face was\nsmooth-shaven, and his blue-black jowls and chin looked painfully\nsmooth. His coarse, black hair was brushed back and plastered firmly\nto his bullet head.\n\nHis body was heavy, but moved with deadly smoothness and precision.\nThe customary harness which passed around his naked torso supported a\ndouble-barreled ironizing electrocution pistol, and also a short,\nsavagely knobbed riot club. Depending from the belt at his waist were\nshort pants, which displayed the thick, hairy legs with their\ncable-like muscles. On his feet were thick socks, so that his toes\nwere able to curl around the rungs of the ladder.\n\nSatisfied with his quick, darting inspection, Gore now came all the\nway down. At the foot of the ladder lay an elderly man in the oblivion\nof sleep. Gore's foot came down on the thin chest. With savage\npleasure he bore down, so that the old man's startled squawk ended in\na fit of coughing. Gore cuffed him aside roughly, growling:\n\n\"Old squiffer! Let that learn you to sleep out of the way!\" He laughed\ncoarsely when one of the prisoners, with the temerity of anonymity,\nstarted to boo, but received no support.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCarelessly Gore passed among the prisoners. Here and there he halted,\nsnatching some article of finery or inconspicuous bit of jewelry that\nhe had overlooked before. They shrank from him, only too glad to see\nhim pass on to the next unfortunate.\n\n\"You, there!\" Gore rasped, indicating Quirl with his stubby\nforefinger. \"Come on out o' there, you!\"\n\nQuirl hoped that the brutal mate would not hear the thudding of his\nbeating heart, or that if he did, he would take it for fear. He came\nslowly toward Gore, who was greedily eyeing the young man's brightly\ncolored and valuable tunic. Quirl came too slowly.\n\n\"What do you take me for?\" Gore bellowed in unreasonable anger. He\nstrode forward, the prisoners scattering before him. His large, knotty\nhand closed on Quirl's arm, and jerked, with the intention of whirling\nthis reluctant prisoner across the room. But Quirl was heavier, and\nhis arm harder, than Gore had supposed. The hand came away, and with a\ntearing scream, the beautiful silk garment ripped off, ruined,\ndisclosing Quirl's white and well-knit body.\n\n\"You done that a-purpose!\" Gore roared, and then his great ape's arms\nwere around Quirl, trying to break his back.\n\nBut that seemingly slight body would not bend, and, as much as Gore\nmight tug and heave, he could not force Quirl back. The little\npig-eyes glared, and there was death in them. Suddenly Gore let go.\nHis hand leaped to the short club at his side, and he swung the weapon\nin a vicious arc. Quirl's relaxed forearm met it, sapping most of its\nforce. Yet when it struck his head it seemed to burst like a ball of\nfire. He crashed against the wall and sank to the floor only half\nconscious.\n\n\"Gore! Gore!\" yelled the guard from the platform, \"'member how sore\nthe Old Man was about the last terrie you killed? Better lay off.\"\n\n\"Shut yo'r damned mug!\" Gore yelled back. But he gave up his idea of\nkicking the prisoner, and with a menacing glare for the guard, passed\non.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs Quirl's mind slowly cleared he congratulated himself for his\nrepression. During his struggle with Gore his hand had come in contact\nwith the butt of the mate's electrogun. He could easily have pulled it\nout of its holster and turned it against its owner. But this hasty\naction would not only have assured his own death, but would have\ndestroyed the only chance the I.F.P. had of learning \"The Scourge's\"\nsecrets.\n\nGore slowly worked his way to the women's side of the hold. Here, much\nto the amusement of the guard and himself, he began stripping off\ntheir long, flowing robes, disclosing their nude bodies. He seemed to\nsee particular humor to heaping indignity on the older women,\ncommenting coarsely on their shortcomings. The men viewed this with\nset, pale faces. But none dared to interfere. In their midst was an\nobject lesson, his head swathed in bandages. He had been the first to\nresent this exhibition, an almost daily event, when the mate's roving\neye had happened to alight upon his wife.\n\nAll at once Gore's careless and derogatory progress was halted, and he\nstared with terrifying intentness at the girl who had until that day\nmanaged to escape his notice. Gore had torn off a nondescript black\ncape that had covered her head and face, and the golden silk robe she\nwore. To Quirl, watching from a space of some sixty feet, her beauty\ncame like a shock. He remembered her as Lenore Hyde, whom he had seen\nonly once before as she emerged briefly from her stateroom.\n\nAbout five feet, six inches tall, her slim figure was dwarfed by the\nhuge bulk of the mate. Her golden hair tumbled over her slim\nshoulders, almost to her waist, where a tasseled cord held the\nclinging silk close to her. Her face, so white that it seemed like\nsilver in that gorgeous setting, was cold and defiant. There was no\nfear in those deep blue eyes under the straight brows--only loathing\nand contempt.\n\nGore was not concerned with the personal feelings of his prize. He\nlicked his wide, cruel lips, seizing the girl's arms as in a vise. His\nother big, dirty hand slipped into the collar of her robe.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut the ripping of fabric did not come. Instead there was a sharp\ncrack, and Gore, too surprised even to move, stared at the little man\nwho had hit him.\n\nAgain _crack_! The impact of fist on jaw. The blow was too weak to\nhurt this toughened veteran of countless battles. But slowly a tide of\ndull red welled up over the bull neck, turning the blue-black jowls to\npurple, and the walls echoed to Gore's roar of anger.\n\nAgain the fists of the smaller man smacked, this time drawing a\ntrickle of blood from Gore's mouth. Then the thick fingers closed on\nthe brave passenger's wrist, and the tremendous muscles swelled as,\nwith a quick movement, Gore thrust his adversary back of him, grasping\nthe other wrist also. Then with slow, irresistible motion, he began\ndrawing the thin arms forward, stretching them, until the unfortunate\nman, drawn against the barrier of Gore's back, began to shriek with\npain.\n\nStill Gore pulled, grinning evilly, and his victim's shoulder blades\nlifted under the tight skin of his back as they took the strain.\nShriek followed shriek, until the guard on the platform glanced\nfurtively out into the central well. There came a dry, tearing crackle\nas the bones of the arms were drawn out of their sockets, and then the\nshrieks ceased as merciful unconsciousness came. Gore tossed the limp\nbody carelessly away.\n\n\"The beast!\" Quirl gritted his teeth. But he stayed where he was,\nhiding his clenched fist, for his was a specific assignment, and men\nof the I.F.P. know the meaning of the word \"duty.\"\n\nIn a better humor again, Gore looked around.\n\n\"Come on, you little ginny!\" he chortled. \"I see you! Come to Moby, my\nbeauty. You'll be queen of the hold, and this scurvy litter will kiss\nyour feet every day.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe pursued her as she ran, bowling over or trampling on the\nfear-stricken prisoners as they tried to scramble out of his way, men\nand women alike. But she made up in agility what she lacked in\nstrength, lifting up the hem of her robe so that her legs twinkled\nbare, ducking under Gore's outstretched arms, or leaping over the\nfallen form of some stumbling, panic-stricken unfortunate.\n\nOnly in her eyes was there a true picture of her terror. Gore's\nuncertain temper was changing again, and in a few moments he was\ncursing foully, his little red-rimmed eyes glistening, as he dashed\nafter her with short, boar-like rushes.\n\nAgain she skimmed past where Quirl cowered in simulated fear, and the\nlook she gave him struck straight at the disguised officer's heart. So\nit was that when she slipped and fell to her knees, and Gore charged\nin with a triumphant laugh, Quirl met him with no thought of anything,\nno feeling but the joy of battle, the delight of a strong man when he\nmeets a foe whom he hates. And to that heady, feral emotion was added\nthe unforgettable picture of a lovely face whose obvious fear was\nsomehow tempered by hope and confidence--in him!\n\nAs Gore lunged past, Quirl struck him. It was a short, sharp,\nwell-timed jab that would have knocked out an ordinary man. But Gore\nwas by no means ordinary. The blow laid open his cheek against the\njawbone, but Gore scarcely slowed as he swerved. With a bellow of\nrage, he came straight at Quirl, arms outstretched.\n\nPhilosophers have said that no matter how far the human race advances\nin the sciences, its fundamental reactions will still be atavistic.\nGore could have dispatched Quirl in a second with his ray weapon, with\nperfect safety. Yet it is doubtful that the weapon even entered his\nmind. As he came to the battle he was driven only by the primitive\nurge to fight with his hands, to maim, to tear limb from limb like the\ngreat simians whom he resembled.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo Quirl, coolly poised, the picture of Gore did not inspire terror.\nIn the passengers, it did. They saw a brutal giant, gorilla-like, and\nroaring like a beast, charging at a half-naked youth apparently only\nhalf his size. It seemed that those tremendous arms must break him at\nthe first touch.\n\nBut the grasping hands slipped off the lithe body as if it were oiled,\nleaving only angry red welts along Quirl's ribs. As the officer edged\naway he planted two blows on Gore's nose, which began to bleed freely.\n\nAgain Gore rushed, and _spat!_ _spat!_ two seemingly light blows\nlanded on his face, opening a cut above his eye and another on his\ncheek bone. In a few seconds of battling he had become a shocking\nsight, with his features almost obscured by welling blood.\n\nAgain Quirl measured him, and this time, instead of evading the grasp\nof the mate's eager arms, he stepped right between them. Like a wraith\nhe slipped into their embrace, and before they could grasp him,\nstanding so close that his chest almost touched his adversary's, he\nwhipped a right to Gore's jaw. It was the kind of punch that makes\nchampions, a whiplike lash of the forearm, with relaxed muscles that\ntighten at the moment of impact. A punch with \"follow-through\" fit to\nknock out ninety-nine men out of a hundred.\n\nBut it did not knock out Gore, and Quirl had to pay dearly for his\nerror. Gore was staggered, but his mighty arms closed, hugging his\nslighter opponent to his hairy chest so that the breath was choked out\nof him, and the metal studs on his harness gouged cruelly into Quirl's\nflesh. His face was blue before he could work his arm loose, and begin\nto prod with stiffened fingers at Gore's throat. Gore had to let go\nthen, and Quirl broke away, boxed for a few moments until he had\nrecovered, and then proceeded to chop Gore's face beyond any semblance\nof humanity.\n\nThe mate had dropped his ray weapon, and now searched for it with\nblinded eyes. He flung his riot club, and it flew wide of the mark. It\nwas obvious that he was going to be beaten into insensibility.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe guard on the platform, seeing the trend of the battle, shouted\nhoarsely up the well, and in a few minutes four men, hard-bitten,\nvillainous looking fellows, tumbled down the ladder and joyously\njoined in the fray. It was then only a matter of seconds before Quirl\nlay on the floor-plates, battered and bleeding, but still feebly\nfighting, while Gore sat astride him, seeking with vicious fingers for\nQuirl's eyes. At the same time his men were kicking at the helpless\nman's body wherever they could reach him.\n\nAt the sight of this brutality the other prisoners, forgetting for the\nmoment their own cowed condition, set up such a bedlam of noise that\nthe guard began to look furtively up the passage, and to shout at the\nruffians.\n\nSuddenly he was whirled aside, and a figure in uniform, moving with\nuncanny speed for a man so massive, appeared upon the platform and\nbounded down the ladder. He was among the struggling men on the floor\nin a moment, and became a maze of flailing arms and legs. Like\nten-pins the pirates scattered, and the giant pulled off the mate.\nGore could not see, but as he writhed he knew he was in the grip of\nthe pirate captain. Captain Strom's harsh, ascetic face was dangerous,\nand his steely gray eyes compelling. The men managed slovenly salutes.\n\n\"Gore,\" Strom snapped, \"have your men get some water and mop up this\nblood. How many times have I told you to quit mauling the prisoners?\nD'ye think I'm in this business to provide amusement for you?\nHenceforth keep out of this hold. Hear?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Gore muttered sullenly.\n\n\"Took five of you bums to handle him, did it?\" Strom remarked\nsardonically, stooping to pick up the unconscious Quirl. He carried\nhim easily, up the ladder. As they disappeared Strom's voice boomed\nout:\n\n\"Dr. Stoddard! Stoddard! Messenger, have Stoddard report at my cabin.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe mate was wiping the blood off his face with a rag.\n\n\"I tried to call yer,\" the guard whined.\n\n\"That tears it!\" Gore exclaimed fiercely, bursting into a string of\nabuse. But one of his henchmen nudged him.\n\n\"Keep yer tongue in yer face, Gore, till the time comes.\"\n\nGore said nothing, but glared savagely at the prisoners.\n\n\"Get the buckets and mops!\" he snarled at his men, and they fled\nprecipitately.\n\nA long, wailing noise came through the hatch:\n\n\"Soopson! S-o-o-pson!\"\n\n\"Here comes yer grub, damn you,\" Gore growled at the prisoners in\ngeneral. A shuffling sound followed the singsong call, and then a\n\"galley boy\" of forty years or so, badly crippled by club-feet,\nshuffled up to the hatch and laboriously let himself down to the\nplatform. The huge bowl of stew he was carrying was far too heavy for\nhim, and his strained, thin face was beady with sweat.\n\n\"Get a move on, Sorko!\" Gore bellowed up at him. \"Get your swill down\nhere. Some o' these swine are goin' short this time, anyway.\"\n\nSorko set the big bowl down at the top of the steps and began to\ndescend backward. Then he resumed his burden.\n\nBut he was nervous, and had barely started when his crippled feet, far\ntoo big for his thin shanks, became entangled. He gave a giddy shriek\nand fell over backward, landing on his back, and lay still. His pale,\nfreckled face became greenish.\n\nBut the bowl, filled to the brim by its greasy, scalding hot contents,\nflew in a sweeping parabola, tipping as it fell, so that the entire\ncontents cascaded on Gore, drenching him from head to foot. Howling\nwith rage and pain he danced around. He was utterly beside himself.\nWhen he was able to see he rushed for Sorko, who was moaning with\nreturning consciousness, and picked up the frail body to hurl it\nagainst the floor.\n\n\"Stop, or you're dead!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat voice, so incisive and clear, was a woman's. Gore found himself\nlooking into the little twin funnels of his own ray projector. They\nwere filled with a milky light, and the odor of ozone was strong. The\ngirl had only to press the trigger and a powerful current would leap\nalong the path of those ionizing beams. And Gore would murder no more.\n\nStupidly, he let Sorko slide to the floor, where the poor fellow\nrecovered sufficiently from his paralyzing fright and his fall to\nscuttle away.\n\nLooking past the menacing weapon, Gore saw the girl, Lenore Hyde. Her\nlimpid eyes under their straight brows were blazing, and he read in\nthem certain death for himself.\n\n\"Up that ladder!\" she ordered sharply, \"and stay out! Guard, when this\nbeast is gone I will give you this weapon. Now, connect up your\nskipper.\"\n\nToo surprised to disobey, the guard threw the televisor switch, and in\na moment Strom's stern face appeared on the screen. He comprehended\nthe situation immediately.\n\n\"Do as she says,\" he ordered brusquely. \"Stoddard is coming to take\ncare of that man of hers that Gore beat up.\"\n\nA few minutes later she was tearfully assisting the ship's doctor to\nput the man with the dislocated shoulders on a stretcher.\n\n\"Your husband?\" asked Stoddard, who resembled a starved gray rat.\n\n\"My brother,\" she exclaimed simply.\n\n\"Want to take care of him?\" And at her eager assent, he said, \"Can't\nafford to let him die. Your family got money?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes! They will pay anything--anything--to get him back safely.\"\n\nThe doctor grinned with satisfaction.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMemory returned to Quirl with the realization that he was lying on a\nmetal bunk in an outside stateroom, where he could see the orderly\nprocession of the stars through the floor ports as the ship rotated.\nHis body was racked with pain, and his head seemed enormous. His\nsensation, he discovered, was due to a thick swathing of bandages.\n\nAs he stirred something moved in an adjoining bunk, and Dr. Stoddard's\npeaked face came into view.\n\n\"How do you feel?\" he asked professionally.\n\n\"Rotten!\"\n\n\"We'll fix that.\" He left, returning a few minutes later with a\nportable apparatus somewhat resembling its progenitor, the diathermy\ngenerator. He disposed a number of insulated loops about Quirl's body\nand head, connecting them through flexible cables to his machine. As a\ngentle humming began, Quirl was conscious of an agreeable warmth, of a\nquickening all over his body. A great lassitude followed, and he\nslept.\n\nWhen he awoke again Captain Strom was standing beside him. He had\ntaken off his coat, and his powerful body filled the blouse he was\nwearing. He had evidently just come off duty, for he still had on his\nblue trousers, with the stripes of gold braid down the sides.\n\n\"It may interest you, Mr. Finner, that I have selected you as one of\nthe chosen,\" he remarked casually.\n\n\"One of the chosen what?\"\n\n\"The chosen race. You didn't take me for an out-and-out damned pirate,\ndid you?\"\n\n\"Excuse me if I seem dumb!\" Quirl hoisted himself on his elbow. \"Yes,\nI figure you're a pirate. What else?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStrom's stern face relaxed in a smile. It was a strange smile,\ninscrutably melancholy. It revealed, beneath the hardness of a\nwarrior, something else; the idealism of a poet. When he spoke again\nit was with a strange gentleness:\n\n\"To attain one's end, one must make use of many means, and sometimes\nto disguise one's purpose. For instance, it is perfectly proper for an\nofficer of the I.F.P. to disguise himself like a son of the idle rich\nin order to lay the infamous 'Scourge' by the heels, isn't it?\"\n\nQuirl felt himself redden. And a cold fear seemed to overwhelm him. He\nrealized that Strom was a zealot, and he knew he would not hesitate to\nkill. This prompt penetration of his disguise was something he had not\nbargained for.\n\n\"What makes you think,\" he asked shortly, \"that I'm an I.F.P. man?\"\n\n\"The fight you gave Gore and his men. Do you expect me to think that a\ncoupon clipper could have done that? I know the way of--\"\n\nHe checked himself. Quirl said:\n\n\"My people have money. I don't know what you mean about--\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, you do,\" Strom interrupted. \"If you were what you claim to\nbe perhaps I would let you go for the ransom, though you took my eye\nfrom the first.\"\n\n\"The ransom will be paid.\"\n\n\"It will not. You will be one of those who do not return. There is\nonly one price I will accept from you.\"\n\n\"Yes? What is that?\"\n\n\"The formula of the new etheric ray.\"\n\n\"I don't know the I.F.P. secrets. I told you that.\"\n\n\"You know how to operate the ray. All its men do. I want you to tell\nme what you know. I can deduce the rest.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nQuirl thought rapidly. Strom was right. The I.F.P. had developed a new\nray that was far superior to the ionizer ray, for the latter required\nan atmosphere of some kind for its operation, while the new one would\nwork equally well in a vacuum.\n\n\"I never heard of any,\" he lied stubbornly. \"Anyway, what do you want\na ray for? Your guns, with no gravity to interfere and no air to stop\nthe bullets, have just about unlimited range, haven't they?\"\n\n\"Spoken like a soldier!\" Again Strom permitted himself a brief\ntriumphant smile. \"And we have the further advantage of invisibility.\nThe ship is surrounded by a net of wires that create a field of force\nwhich bend light rays around us. That explains why your men have never\ncaught us. But to get back to our subject. I will tell you something.\nDo you know who I am?\"\n\nQuirl looked at him. Strom appeared to be at least sixty years old.\nBut the fine, erect figure, the rugged features told nothing.\n\n\"Did you ever hear of Lieutenant Burroughs?\" Strom asked casually.\n\n\"Burroughs--the man without a planet!\" Quirl ejaculated. \"Are you\nBurroughs, the traitor?\" Immediately he regretted his heedlessness.\nStrom's face darkened in anger, and for a moment the pirate captain\ndid not reply. When he did he was a little calmer.\n\n\"Traitor they called me!\" he exclaimed vehemently. \"I a traitor--the\nmost loyal man in the solar system guard. Surrounded by rottenness and\nintrigue--\n\n\"But you wouldn't know. You were but a lad learning to fly your first\ntoy helics when that happened. Years later the Martian Cabal was\nexposed, and the leading plotters--the traitors--were punished. But\nthat was not till later, and the court's irreversible decree against\nme had been carried out. I, the unsuspecting messenger, the loyal,\neager dupe, was made the cat's-paw. I was put on an old, condemned\nfreighter, with food and supplies supposed to last me a lifetime, but\nwith no power capsules and no means of steering the ship. I was set\nadrift in a derelict on a lonely orbit of exile around the sun--the\nman without a planet!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Picture that, lad. That rusty, dead old cylinder, coursing around and\naround the sun, and inside, sitting on his bales and boxes, a young\nman like you. A young man in the pride and prime of his life,\nexpiating the treason that had betrayed him. Day after day, through\nthe thick ports, I saw the same changeless scene. And every two years,\nwhen I drew near the Earth, I watched the beautiful green ball of it,\nwith what bitter longings! As I watched it dwindle away again into\nthe blackness of space, I thought of the fortunate, selfish, stupid\nand cruel beings who lived on it, and hated them. They had banished\nme, an innocent man, to whirl forever and ever around the sun, in my\nsteel tomb!\n\n\"But that cruel judgment was never executed. Seven years ago this Gore\nfound me. He is an escaped convict, and he came in a little five-man\nrocket he had stolen. We loaded up all of the supplies the little ship\nwould hold, for Gore had no food, and escaped to Titan, landing on an\nisland on the side opposite to where the mines are.\n\n\"Gore wanted to become a pirate, and as he could get men, I consented.\nHe scraped them up, fugitives from justice, every one of them. We\nbuilt this ship, and I invented the invisibility field of force--\"\n\n\"Just a moment,\" Quirl interrupted, vastly interested. \"I saw your\nship through the ports that day.\"\n\n\"True. The presence of your ship in the field distorted it so much\nthat it was ineffective. But at all other times--right now--we are\nutterly invisible. One of the I.F.P. patrols may pass within a mile of\nus and never see us.\n\n\"As we raided the interplanetary commerce, I began to weed out the\npeople we captured. Those that showed the highest intelligence, sense\nof justice and physical perfection I selected to be the nucleus of a\nnew race, to be kept on Titan for a time and then to be transplanted\nto a new planet of one of the nearer solar systems.\n\n\"My principal trouble is with the crew. They can collect ransom only\non those I reject, and there are constant clashes between me and Gore.\nIt is now my intention to let them go their way, and to fit out a new\nship, with a new crew. I offer you the place of first mate.\"\n\n\"No!\" Quirl replied crisply. \"You say you understand the honor of the\nForce, and then offer me a job pirating with you. No, thanks!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStrom, or Burroughs, made no attempt to conceal his disappointment.\nThe recital of his wrongs had brought out the bitter lines of his\nface, and the weariness of one who plays his game alone and can call\nno one friend.\n\n\"I should have known better,\" he said quietly. \"There was none more\nloyal to the I.F.P. than I--when I still belonged to it. Yet, I\nthought if I laid all my cards before you--You realize what this\nmeans?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Quirl replied soberly. \"It means you will never dare to let me\nbe ransomed nor to free me among your selected people. It\nmeans--death!\"\n\n\"Not death! I will parole you.\"\n\nQuirl felt an overmastering surge of sympathy. He saw this pirate as\nlater historians have come to see him--a man of lofty and noble\npurpose who was made the victim of shrewder, meaner minds in the most\ndespicable interplanetary imbroglio ever to disgrace a solar system.\nThe thought of his own fate, should he refuse the offer, did not\ndepress Quirl as much as the necessity of heaping more disappointment\non this deeply wronged \"man without a planet.\"\n\n\"Captain,\" he said slowly, with deep regret. \"You remember the I.F.P.\noath?\" And at the other's flush he hurried on. \"Knowing that oath you\nknow what my answer must be. Put me in irons or kill me!\"\n\n\"I know,\" Strom added wistfully. \"Would you--if I could just once more\nshake the clean hand of a brave man and a gentleman--\"\n\nQuirl's hand shot out and gripped the long, powerful fingers of the\npirate captain.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nQuirl was willing to compromise to the extent of not revealing\nanything to the other passengers, for the privilege of being kept in\nthe prison hold rather than in solitary confinement. Here he would be\nunder the vigilant eye of a guard, with possibly less chance of\neffecting an escape in some way, but he felt a great desire to be near\nthe girl Lenore, and to know that she was safe and in good spirits.\n\nThey fastened him by means of a light chain and hoop that locked\naround his waist to a staple set in the floor near one wall. The other\nprisoners regarded him as a hero, for since the day of the epic fight\nthe mate had kept away, and they had been treated with tolerable\ndecency. Quirl was able to cheer them up with predictions that the\nmost of them would be eligible to ransom. But as he looked at the pale\nbeauty of Lenore he felt grave misgivings, for he knew that a man of\nStrom's discernment would want her for his projected Utopia without\nquestion.\n\nShe did not speak to him while the hero-worshipping crowd were\nfluttering about him to their heart's content. When they finally left\nhim alone she came up to him silently, and sat on the floor beside\nhim.\n\n\"I want to thank you,\" she said quietly, clearly, \"for what you did\nfor me and my brother, Mr.--\"\n\n\"Finner. Quirl Finner. I have thought of you as Lenore, and wondered\nhow you were. How long has it been since they took me out? You see--\"\nhe grinned, \"I was asleep.\"\n\n\"Five days. At least, they turned off the lights five times for the\nsleeping periods.\"\n\n\"The man who fought for you--how is he?\"\n\n\"My brother--is dead!\"\n\nQuirl looked away so that he should not see the quick tears springing\nto her eyes. But a few moments later he felt her cool hand on his\nscarred forehead, and she was smiling bravely.\n\n\"Tragedies such as these, Quirl, were common in the lives of our\nancestors. They were able to bear them, and we can bear them. All his\nlife my poor brother has lived as a gentleman, sheltered, protected by\nclass barriers. When he died of pneumonia caused by the jagged end of\na broken rib--so Dr. Stoddard says--I think he had a lively sense of\nsatisfaction that he should end in such a way. If it had not been for\nme--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe came to him often, after that, to sit quietly by his side, and to\nbring his food to him from the big community bowl which even the most\nfastidious of the prisoners had come to look forward to. She told of\nher life as the daughter of a capitalist who owned large mine holdings\non Titan. It would be about time for the _Celestia_ to reach Titan,\nand her non-arrival would be causing anxiety to Lenore's father\nawaiting her there. The void would be swarming with I.F.P. patrols,\nbut as the pirate ship was invisible nothing would be found but the\nmysteriously looted and abandoned _Celestia_.\n\nThere was no longer any reason for concealing from her the fact that\nhe himself was a member of the I.F.P., and Quirl told Lenore of the\nadventurous life he and his companions had led. Of forays to far-away\nand as yet undisciplined Pluto, of tropical Venus and Mercury, where\nthe rains never cease, of the hostile and almost unknown planet of\nAryl, within the orbit of Mercury, where no man has ever seen a true\nimage of the landscape because of the stupendous and never-ending\nmirages.\n\nAs time passed they were drawn together by the bonds of propinquity\nand mutual interest--this obscure police officer and the daughter of\none of the most powerful men in the solar system. But Quirl did not\nname his love, for always there was the grim present of their\ncaptivity, the ghastly uncertainty of the future.\n\nThe little \"galley boy\" Sorko seemed daily more frail. Apparently the\nfall he had sustained had done him some internal injury. Often the\nguard, with many a ribald comment, had to help him get his emptied\nbowl back up the ladder.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne day he seemed overcome by great weakness. Staggering, he held his\nhand to his sweat-dewed forehead. Erratically he waltzed across the\nfloor, to crumple in a heap where Quirl and the girl were sitting.\nMoved by compassion, Lenore composed his body in a more comfortable\nposition, and with a bit of handkerchief moistened the pirate's\nwrinkled, old-young face with some of Quirl's drinking water. The\nguard looked on indifferently.\n\n\"Guard!\" Quirl shouted. \"He's going to die. Come and take him to the\nlazaret.\"\n\n\"Sez you!\" returned the guard callously. \"Me, I stay on post till\nrelieved. Sorko'll be all right. He's been throwin' them fits right\nregular.\"\n\nSorko's lips moved feebly, and Lenore bent down to catch his words.\nThey were barely audible:\n\n\"I'm all right, lady. You done me a good turn when you made Gore put\nme down, and I'm doin' you one now. I wouldn't do this for no one\nelse.\" He gasped.\n\n\"Water!\" Lenore exclaimed sharply, and Quirl handed her the rest of\nhis cup.\n\n\"Ain't water he wants,\" the amused guard observed. \"The blighter's\nplayin' for a good chew of merclite!\"[1]\n\n[Footnote 1: Merclite, a highly stimulating gum. It was prohibited by\ninterplanetary proclamation, but was always obtainable through the\nsurreptitious channels of a highly profitable traffic.]\n\n\"I ain't as bad as I'm makin' out,\" Sorko whispered. \"Got to do it to\ntell you this, 'cause you was square with me. Gore is fixin' to have a\nmut'ny. Kill captain, kill all these dubs here--this guy of yourn,\ntoo. He wants to take you for his--\" the weazened little face twisted\nin unwonted shy delicacy--\"take you for him, pretty lady. I don't\nwant him to. I'm not--a--bad feller--\"\n\n\"What the hell, Sorko!\" the puzzled guard exclaimed over the delay.\n\"You bandy-legged rat, get up there, or I'll give you a jolt.\"\n\nLenore looked up, indignant.\n\n\"You heartless wretch! Would you let this man--\"\n\n\"Comin'!\" Sorko scrambling to his feet, shuffling to the table, where\nhe retrieved his bowl. Quirl and Lenore watched his painful progress\nup the ladder, until at last he disappeared into the passage.\n\n\"Quirl,\" she murmured, as her hand sought his, \"take this.\"\n\nHe felt a small bit of metal, and looking at it cautiously, saw that\nhe had a rough key, filed out of a piece of flat metal.\n\n\"The key to that hoop around your waist. He copied it from the one the\ncaptain has, I suppose.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis hopes high all at once, Quirl sought the compact little lock in\nthe small of his back. It took a long time to get the key in, and then\nit would not turn. It had been unskillfully made, and was probably not\na true reproduction. Nevertheless, by constant effort, he succeeded at\nlast in turning it, and was rewarded by hearing a faint click. He\ntested the hoop, felt it slip, and knew that at any time he chose he\ncould free himself.\n\n\"Lenore, dear,\" he told her. \"Go with the other women now. We must do\nnothing to make the guard suspicious. We don't know when this mutiny\nis to come off, but we are close to Saturn now; it can't be long. Go\nnow.\"\n\n\"Good-by, dear. Be careful!\"\n\nIt seemed an eternity until the emanation disk became dim and went out\nand the prisoners made sleepy sounds. A relief guard took station,\nand the ship became silent, so that one could hear the rumbling of the\npropelling rockets. As there were no ports in this hold, there was no\nlight whatever except the faint glow that came from the central\npassage above the platform. Against this the pirate was outlined as he\nsat on his stool. As Quirl's eyes became accustomed to the darkness he\ncould see the play of faint highlights on his muscular torso, and so\nhe waited.\n\nHe thought over the situation. The safest and easiest course would be\nto create such a disturbance that Captain Strom would be attracted to\nthe scene. This would probably not involve anything more than a severe\nbeating for himself, and he would then find opportunity to acquaint\nStrom with the projected mutiny somehow. That Strom would know how to\ndeal with it he never doubted. Lenore might then still be forcibly\nimpressed as a citizen of Strom's new planet, but at least she would\nnot be exposed to the infinitely worse fate of becoming the plaything\nof Gore and his villainous crew.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe flaw of this plan was that Quirl himself would still be under\npractical sentence of death. Strom would not let his gratitude carry\nhim so far as to release a man who knew as much as Quirl did, and who\nwould not promise to keep his secrets.\n\nThe preferable, though far more dangerous course was to strike before\nthe mutineers could. Quirl knew something about the structure of the\nship. It was built around the tubular passage, and every hold or group\nof rooms opened on this well, from the bow where the navigators were\nto the stern where the rockets were located. Somewhere there would be\na generating room where the invisibility field was being produced. If\nhe could find this and wreck the generators one of the I.F.P. ships\nwith which this part of space doubtless swarmed, would sight them, and\nafter that everything was in the hands of fate.\n\nQuirl nervously waited for the guard to nod. At any moment he expected\nto hear a hellish bedlam break loose--the beginning of the mutiny. And\nthe guard seemed alert. There was nothing to do but take a chance.\n\nQuirl sighed as if he were turning in his sleep, so that the clink of\nthe released chain would not seem out of place. The guard did not\nstir. Slowly, very slowly, Quirl crept across the floor. He had been\nrobbed of all his clothing except his torn silk trousers; and his\nboots were gone, so he was able to move as quietly as a cat.\n\nWith tense silence he ascended the ladder, praying that his weight\nwould not send up a warning vibration. But his luck held. He was\nnearly at the top before it broke.\n\n\"Take him off! Take him off!\" It was an eery, strangled shriek from\none of the male prisoners in the throes of a nightmare. With a\nstartled curse the guard thudded to his feet, peered tensely into the\ndarkness, his weapon sending twin milky beams of the powerful ionizing\nray toward the source of the sound.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe dreamer had awakened, still gasping in the grip of fear, and other\ndisturbed sleepers were grumbling.\n\n\"Better go easy, you fools,\" the pirate warned them. \"Yer just in luck\nthat I didn't let loose a couple bolts on ye. Got a good notion to do\nit, anyway.\" He played the dangerous little spots of light around,\namused as the prisoners scrambled for safety, but with no real\nintention of releasing the deadly electric charge along the paths\nprovided for it. This cruel pleasure cost him his life. As he turned\nhis back Quirl leaped. His iron-hard forearm rose and fell, and the\nedge of his hand came down on the back of the pirate's thick neck.\nThere was a muffled crack and he slumped to the platform grating.\n\nQuickly the officer stripped off the man's harness and buckled it\naround his own naked chest. The electrogun had been uninjured, and\nhooked to the belt was also the riot club, a truly appalling thing at\nclose quarters. Quirl carried the body down, laid it prone in the\ncorner he had occupied, snapped on the waistlock, and threw a ragged\nold blanket over the hairy legs. In the forthcoming disturbance, if\nanyone looked in, he would think the inert form a sleeping prisoner,\nand that the guard had deserted post.\n\nQuirl had feared an outbreak among the prisoners, but they were so\napathetic that they paid little attention. Perhaps they thought it was\nQuirl who had been killed, and he did not dare even a whispered\nfarewell to the girl he knew was watching somewhere in the darkness.\n\nMuch to Quirl's delight, the long, tubular passage was deserted. Here\nthe centrifugal gravity was less than it had been in the hold. A weird\nplace, this central tube, where every direction was down, and a man\ncould walk on his ceiling, his floor, his walls with equal facility.\nNo top nor bottom--just a long, smooth tube with numerous enigmatic\ndoors leading to--where?\n\nAt least it was easy to tell where the bow of the ship was. A light\nshone through a transom over the door to the navigating room. Should\nhe try to hold up the navigating officer? He decided against that.\nThere would be at least three men in there, and it was the custom to\nkeep those quarters locked.\n\n\"If only I knew where they generate the invisibility field!\" he\nmuttered, as he stood irresolute.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOpportunity came at that moment. A crack of light appeared along the\npassage. A door was opening there. A moment later a head and\nshoulders showed. Someone was climbing up. Swiftly the officer ran to\nthe place. The pirate did not even suspect anything wrong until he\nfelt the spots of milky light on his face. He showed his terror\nplainly.\n\n\"Get up!\" Quirl hissed. The man obeyed with alacrity. Quirl glanced\ndown. He saw tiers of bunks, evidently one of the crew's dormitories.\n\nHe now turned to the cowering pirate.\n\n\"I'd as soon kill you as not!\" Quirl snarled.\n\n\"You got me wrong, brother!\" the pirate whined. \"I'm with Gore in this\ndeal. Lay off!\"\n\n\"Where you bound for?\"\n\n\"I have to relieve Burke at the ventilating turbines.\"\n\n\"Let Burke wait. Lead on to the invisibility generators.\"\n\n\"Oh, I can't do that, mister! I got to have a pass. Say, mister, I was\njust kidding about being one of Gore's men. I'm for the cap'n, yes,\nsir!\"\n\n\"You lying scum!\" Quirl barked impatiently. \"Get going!\"\n\nThe white-faced and bewildered pirate led the way down the tube to the\nafter end. He unlatched a door and tried to enter, but as soon as he\nhad dropped through to the platform he was met by a guard with leveled\nionizer.\n\n\"This gem'man,\" he started to explain. But Quirl dropped after him and\ngave him a powerful shove, so that he crashed into the guard. The\nlatter pulled the trigger, and the unfortunate pirate crashed over the\nplatform's edge to the floor. Quirl had out his own electrogun and\ndispatched the guard. At the same time he felt a stunning shock. His\nsenses reeled, but the grating had taken part of the discharge loosed\nby a pirate electrician at the foot of the ladder. Quirl threw his\nriot club and followed that up with another lightning bolt.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was then the only living person in the room, in which two\ngenerators hummed softly. Connected to them was a bank of U-shaped\ntubes, each as tall as a man, which were filled with silent livid\nfire. Quirl picked up a wrench and started hammering at the thick\ntubes until the glass cracked. Each time he was engulfed by a wave of\nheat, and the tube became black. The great generators idled and\nautomatically came to a stop. Quirl was certain now that the pirate\nship would be visible, but the position of the captives was still\ndesperate. He hoped that none of the surviving pirates would think of\ncalling at the generator room, or find out in some other way that they\nwere now visible in the eternal day of space.\n\nQuietly he climbed back to the passage and closed the hatch. He cast\nabout for his next move. He was looking toward the bow, but on hearing\nthe subdued clink of metal on metal, he turned.\n\nA dozen of the pirates were coming toward him.\n\nIt would have been useless to draw his weapon. Theirs were out and\ncould have burned him to a crisp before he could move. Silently and\nwith deadliness apparent in every move they approached him.\n\n\"Hope they try to capture me alive!\" he thought. \"What a dog-fight\nthat'll be!\"\n\nNow they were nearly up to him.\n\n\"Come along, you fool!\" barked the leader of the group as they were\nall around him. \"Sapheads like you'll give the whole game away.\"\n\nQuirl could have laughed. This was evidently part of the mutineers'\ncrew bent on their errand of murder. In the dim light they had taken\nhim for one of their number. He went with them, meekly.\n\n\"Unlocked!\" The leader whom Quirl had not seen before, exclaimed with\nsatisfaction. He pulled the hatch open softly and the hinges had been\noiled. Quietly as panthers they descended the ladder. They stood at\nthe bottom. Still another door barred the way. Quirl now realized that\nthey were attacking the captain's quarters. But the leader produced a\nkey, and silently swung the door open.\n\n\"So, you dogs! You've come!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLike an infuriated bull Captain Strom charged them, a riot club in\neach hand. He could have killed them all with a ray, but he chose to\nvent in physical action his consuming anger at their treachery, which\nhe had in some way anticipated. Three or four went sprawling under his\nmighty blows. The others sought shelter behind tables and chests, and\nbegan stabbing at him with their electroguns. Electricity crackled,\nand the air became pungent with ozone. A pair of the twin rays struck\nthe captain's gold braid, and he went down. With a triumphant yell a\nman dashed at him, murderous club up-raised. But Quirl was faster, and\nthe pirate fell dead with a crushed skull.\n\nStrom was up again, fighting beside Quirl. The pirates remaining fell\nunder their furious blows, and the two dashed out. Strom said nothing,\nand Quirl was not sure that he had been recognized. The captain\ncharged straight for the navigating bow. Here, unless he should be\nattacked by the I.F.P. he could still control the situation. He was\nperhaps still ignorant of the ship's visibility.\n\nBut Quirl made for the prisoners' hold. They would be cowering there,\nprobably in darkness, not knowing what was going on. It was his\nintention to rally them, provide them with the weapons of the fallen\npirates, and so be in a position to advantageously make terms with\nwhoever was victorious in this battle.\n\nHe saw, as he approached that the light was on. He was hardly a dozen\nfeet away when the door was darkened. Quirl did not have to hear her\ncry to know that Gore had Lenore.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRunning with remarkable speed, the mate carried his prize toward the\nafter end of the tube. A hatch stood open there, and he dropped\nthrough, slamming it after him.\n\nQuirl picked up a bar that someone had dropped. It was but a matter of\nmoments to break the lock and pull open the hatch. The hold was\nlighted, and empty. In its middle, holding the helpless Lenore, stood\nGore, the electrogun in his hand covering the platform.\n\n\"Boy scout to the rescue again!\" Gore sneered. He was even more\nrepulsive than before, with the marks Quirl had left on him in the\nlast battle. But he was fearless and utterly reckless. \"Well, m'lad, I\nknow when I'm done. And when a fellow's done he don't care what\nhappens. So here's the lay: When I get out of here, I'll be dead. And\n_she'll_ be dead, or you'll wish she was. Get it? She'll be killed,\ntoo, if you jolt me--the shock'll pass to her. And the first man-jack\nwho crosses that grating'll get his from me. Now then, go ahead and\npull! Goin' to kill us both, or leave her to me?\" He laughed\ndefiantly, like one who counts himself already dead.\n\nQuirl tentatively placed one foot on the platform. Instantly a fat\nspark jumped from the metal to his foot, and sent him sprawling into\nthe tube. He saw Strom coming toward him. He had killed his enemies in\nthe control room and was now on the hunt for more.\n\n\"Thanks for what you did,\" he grunted. As a forlorn hope, Quirl\nexplained the situation. Strom smiled a rare smile.\n\n\"That's all right,\" he said mildly. \"Quirl, you're a square man, and\nI'd rather do something for a square enemy than a false friend. Oh, I\ncan do it cheaply. The jig's up for me, anyway!\"\n\nQuickly he dropped through the door and launched himself. Gore saw him\ncoming, and Strom's body shuddered as the bolt struck squarely. He\nwas dead when he hit, but his great weight knocked Gore down.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nQuirl had time to jump after him, knocking the wind out of Gore before\nhe could rise. Lenore picked up Gore's weapon, but dared not use it\nfor fear of injuring her lover. As the two fighting men circled\nwarily, seeking openings in this battle that must be fatal to one of\nthem, they did not see the slight, shadowy figure that dropped down to\nthem. There was a flash, and Gore slumped, a knife in his back.\n\n\"I done it! I done for him!\" chattered Sorko. \"The dirty, lousy--\"\n\n\"Come, Lenore, let's get up to the bow before the pirates think of\nit.\" They dashed up the ladder. Some more of the disks were out, and\nit was nearly dark. Three sinewy forms pounced on Quirl the moment he\nentered the passage. The girl, too, was caught, though she fought and\nbit.\n\n\"Lights! Let's have some lights!\" commanded an authoritative voice.\n\n\"Coming, sir!\" came a far-away answer.\n\nThe passage became bright, and Quirl looked into the faces of his\ncaptors, in the uniforms of the I.F.P.\n\n\"Got you, you dirty pirate!\" gloated the husky young man on his chest.\n\n\"Mike!\" Quirl gasped, \"don't you know me? How'd you get here?\"\n\n\"Dog-gone! Finner! Leggo his legs, you eggs.\"\n\n\"Trailed you,\" he added. \"Glommed our magnets on the navigating bow.\nExpected a fight, but some big guy let us in through an airlock. Well,\nhe'd done plenty of scrapping--all the clothes torn off him. Half a\ndozen dead pirates in there. Who is he?\"\n\nQuirl thought of the stiffening body of Lieutenant Burroughs, alias\nCaptain Strom, who had just purchased his life and that of Lenore at\nthe cost of his own. Was his undeserved shame now to follow him to\nhis grave? Quirl was no lawyer, and he decided not to take any chances\nwith the law's mercy. He said:\n\n\"I don't know his name. A prisoner from some other ship, I think. He\nwas very homesick for Earth, and I'll see he gets a decent grave on\nEarth. He died to save me.\"\n\n\"As for the lady,\" he added, \"let her go.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
