Beam Piper_\n\n    There was no stopping General Zarvas' rebellion\n\n(Illustration by Lawrence)\n\n[Illustration]\n\n     _Hunted and hated in two worlds, Hradzka dreamed of a monomaniac's\n     glory, stranded in the past with his knowledge of the future. But\n     he didn't know the past quite well enough...._\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nBut yesterday, a whole planet had shouted: _Hail Hradzka! Hail the\nLeader!_ Today, they were screaming: _Death to Hradzka! Kill the\ntyrant!_\n\nThe Palace, where Hradzka, surrounded by his sycophants and guards, had\nlorded it over a solar system, was now an inferno. Those who had been\ntoo closely identified with the dictator's rule to hope for forgiveness\nwere fighting to the last, seeking only a quick death in combat; one by\none, their isolated points of resistance were being wiped out. The\ncorridors and chambers of the huge palace were thronged with rebels,\nloud with their shouts, and with the rasping hiss of heat-beams and the\ncrash of blasters, reeking with the stench of scorched plastic and\nburned flesh, of hot metal and charred fabric. The living quarters were\noverrun; the mob smashed down walls and tore up floors in search of\nsecret hiding-places. They found strange things--the space-ship that had\nbeen built under one of the domes, in readiness for flight to the\nstill-loyal colonies on Mars or the Asteroid Belt, for instance--but\nHradzka himself they could not find.\n\nAt last, the search reached the New Tower which reared its head five\nthousand feet above the palace, the highest thing in the city. They\nblasted down the huge steel doors, cut the power from the\nenergy-screens. They landed from antigrav-cars on the upper levels. But\nexcept for barriers of metal and concrete and energy, they met with no\nopposition. Finally, they came to the spiral stairway which led up to\nthe great metal sphere which capped the whole structure.\n\nGeneral Zarvas, the Army Commander who had placed himself at the head of\nthe revolt, stood with his foot on the lowest step, his followers behind\nhim. There was Prince Burvanny, the leader of the old nobility, and\nGhorzesko Orhm, the merchant, and between them stood Tobbh, the\nchieftain of the mutinous slaves. There were clerks; laborers; poor but\nhaughty nobles: and wealthy merchants who had long been forced to hide\ntheir riches from the dictator's tax-gatherers, and soldiers, and\nspacemen.\n\n\"You'd better let some of us go first sir,\" General Zarvas' orderly, a\nblood-stained bandage about his head, his uniform in rags, suggested.\n\"You don't know what might be up there.\"\n\nThe General shook his head. \"I'll go first.\" Zarvas Pol was not the man\nto send subordinates into danger ahead of himself. \"To tell the truth,\nI'm afraid we won't find anything at all up there.\"\n\n\"You mean...?\" Ghorzesko Orhm began.\n\n\"The 'time-machine',\" Zarvas Pol replied. \"If he's managed to get it\nfinished, the Great Mind only knows where he may be, now. Or when.\"\n\nHe loosened the blaster in his holster and started up the long spiral.\nHis followers spread out, below; sharp-shooters took position to cover\nhis ascent. Prince Burvanny and Tobbh the Slave started to follow him.\nThey hesitated as each motioned the other to precede him; then the\nnobleman followed the general, his blaster drawn, and the brawny slave\nbehind him.\n\nThe door at the top was open, and Zarvas Pol stepped through but there\nwas nothing in the great spherical room except a raised dais some fifty\nfeet in diameter, its polished metal top strangely clean and empty. And\na crumpled heap of burned cloth and charred flesh that had, not long\nago, been a man. An old man with a white beard, and the seven-pointed\nstar of the Learned Brothers on his breast, advanced to meet the armed\nintruders.\n\n\"So he is gone, Kradzy Zago?\" Zarvas Pol said, holstering his weapon.\n\"Gone in the 'time-machine', to hide in yesterday or tomorrow. And you\nlet him go?\"\n\nThe old one nodded. \"He had a blaster, and I had none.\" He indicated the\nbody on the floor. \"Zoldy Jarv had no blaster, either, but he tried to\nstop Hradzka. See, he squandered his life as a fool squanders his money,\ngetting nothing for it. And a man's life is not money, Zarvas Pol.\"\n\n\"I do not blame you, Kradzy Zago,\" General Zarvas said. \"But now you\nmust get to work, and build us another 'time-machine', so that we can\nhunt him down.\"\n\n\"Does revenge mean so much to you, then?\"\n\nThe soldier made an impatient gesture. \"Revenge is for fools, like that\npack of screaming beasts below. I do not kill for revenge; I kill\nbecause dead men do no harm.\"\n\n\"Hradzka will do us no more harm,\" the old scientist replied. \"He is a\nthing of yesterday; of a time long past and half-lost in the mists of\nlegend.\"\n\n\"No matter. As long as he exists, at any point in space-time, Hradzka is\nstill a threat. Revenge means much to Hradzka; he will return for it,\nwhen we least expect him.\"\n\nThe old man shook his head. \"No, Zarvas Pol, Hradzka will not return.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHradzka holstered his blaster, threw the switch that sealed the\n\"time-machine\", put on the antigrav-unit and started the time-shift\nunit. He reached out and set the destination-dial for the\nmid-Fifty-Second Century of the Atomic Era. That would land him in the\nNinth Age of Chaos, following the Two-Century War and the collapse of\nthe World Theocracy. A good time for his purpose: the world would be\nslipping back into barbarism, and yet possess the technologies of former\ncivilizations. A hundred little national states would be trying to\nregain social stability, competing and warring with one another. Hradzka\nglanced back over his shoulder at the cases of books, record-spools,\ntri-dimensional pictures, and scale-models. These people of the past\nwould welcome him and his science of the future, would make him their\nleader.\n\nHe would start in a small way, by taking over the local feudal or tribal\ngovernment, would arm his followers with weapons of the future. Then he\nwould impose his rule upon neighboring tribes, or princedoms, or\ncommunes, or whatever, and build a strong sovereignty; from that he\nenvisioned a world empire, a Solar System empire.\n\nThen, he would build \"time-machines\", many \"time-machines\". He would\nrecruit an army such as the universe had never seen, a swarm of men from\nevery age in the past. At that point, he would return to the Hundredth\nCentury of the Atomic Era, to wreak vengeance upon those who had risen\nagainst him. A slow smile grew on Hradzka's thin lips as he thought of\nthe tortures with which he would put Zarvas Pol to death.\n\nHe glanced up at the great disc of the indicator and frowned. Already he\nwas back to the year 7500, A.E., and the temporal-displacement had not\nbegun to slow. The disc was turning even more rapidly--7000, 6000, 5500;\nhe gasped slightly. Then he had passed his destination; he was now in\nthe Fortieth Century, but the indicator was slowing. The hairline\ncrossed the Thirtieth Century, the Twentieth, the Fifteenth, the Tenth.\nHe wondered what had gone wrong, but he had recovered from his fright by\nthis time. When this insane machine stopped, as it must around the First\nCentury of the Atomic Era, he would investigate, make repairs, then\nshift forward to his target-point. Hradzka was determined upon the\nFifty-Second Century; he had made a special study of the history of that\nperiod, had learned the language spoken then, and he understood the\nmethods necessary to gain power over the natives of that time.\n\nThe indicator-disc came to a stop, in the First Century. He switched on\nthe magnifier and leaned forward to look; he had emerged into normal\ntime in the year 10 of the Atomic Era, a decade after the first\nuranium-pile had gone into operation, and seven years after the first\natomic bombs had been exploded in warfare. The altimeter showed that he\nwas hovering at eight thousand feet above ground-level.\n\nSlowly, he cut out the antigrav, letting the \"time machine\" down easily.\nHe knew that there had been no danger of materializing inside anything;\nthe New Tower had been built to put it above anything that had occupied\nthat space-point at any moment within history, or legend, or even the\ngeological knowledge of man. What lay below, however, was uncertain. It\nwas night--the visi-screen showed only a star-dusted, moonless-sky, and\ndark shadows below. He snapped another switch; for a few micro-seconds a\nbeam of intense light was turned on, automatically photographing the\nlandscape under him. A second later, the developed picture was projected\nupon another screen; it showed only wooded mountains and a barren,\nbrush-grown valley.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe \"time-machine\" came to rest with a soft jar and a crashing of broken\nbushes that was audible through the sound pickup. Hradzka pulled the\nmain switch; there was a click as the shielding went out and the door\nopened. A breath of cool night air drew into the hollow sphere.\n\nThen there was a loud _bang_ inside the mechanism, and a flash of\nblue-white light which turned to pinkish flame with a nasty crackling.\nCurls of smoke began to rise from the square black box that housed the\n\"time-shift\" mechanism, and from behind the instrument-board. In a\nmoment, everything was glowing-hot: driblets of aluminum and silver were\nrunning down from the instruments. Then the whole interior of the\n\"time-machine\" was afire; there was barely time for Hradzka to leap\nthrough the open door.\n\nThe brush outside impeded him, and he used his blaster to clear a path\nfor himself away from the big sphere, which was now glowing faintly on\nthe outside. The heat grew in intensity, and the brush outside was\ntaking fire. It was not until he had gotten two hundred yards from the\nmachine that he stopped, realizing what had happened.\n\nThe machine, of course, had been sabotaged. That would have been young\nZoldy, whom he had killed, or that old billy-goat, Kradzy Zago; the\nlatter, most likely. He cursed both of them for having marooned him in\nthis savage age, at the very beginning of atomic civilization, with all\nhis printed and recorded knowledge destroyed. Oh, he could still gain\nmastery over these barbarians; he knew enough to fashion a crude\nblaster, or a heat-beam gun, or an atomic-electric conversion unit. But\nwithout his books and records, he could never build an antigrav unit,\nand the secret of the \"temporal shift\" was lost.\n\nFor \"Time\" is not an object, or a medium which can be travelled along.\nThe \"Time-Machine\" was not a vehicle; it was a mechanical process of\ndisplacement within the space-time continuum, and those who constructed\nit knew that it could not be used with the sort of accuracy that the\ndials indicated. Hradzka had ordered his scientists to produce a \"Time\nMachine\", and they had combined the possible--displacement within the\nspace-time continuum--with the sort of fiction the dictator demanded,\nfor their own well-being. Even had there been no sabotage, his return to\nhis own \"time\" was nearly of zero probability.\n\nThe fire, spreading from the \"time-machine\", was blowing toward him; he\nobserved the wind-direction and hurried around out of the path of the\nflames. The light enabled him to pick his way through the brush, and,\nafter crossing a small stream, he found a rutted road and followed it up\nthe mountainside until he came to a place where he could rest concealed\nuntil morning.\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nIt was broad daylight when he woke, and there was a strange throbbing\nsound; Hradzka lay motionless under the brush where he had slept, his\nblaster ready. In a few minutes, a vehicle came into sight, following\nthe road down the mountainside.\n\nIt was a large thing, four-wheeled, with a projection in front which\nprobably housed the engine and a cab for the operator. The body of the\nvehicle was simply an open rectangular box. There were two men in the\ncab, and about twenty or thirty more crowded into the box body. These\nwere dressed in faded and nondescript garments of blue and gray and\nbrown; all were armed with crude weapons--axes, bill-hooks, long-handled\ninstruments with serrated edges, and what looked like broad-bladed\nspears. The vehicle itself, which seemed to be propelled by some sort of\nchemical-explosion engine, was dingy and mud-splattered; the men in it\nwere ragged and unshaven. Hradzka snorted in contempt; they were\nprobably warriors of the local tribe, going to the fire in the belief\nthat it had been started by raiding enemies. When they found the\nwreckage of the \"time-machine\", they would no doubt believe that it was\nthe chariot of some god and drag it home to be venerated.\n\nA plan of action was taking shape in his mind. First, he must get\nclothing of the sort worn by these people, and find a safe hiding-place\nfor his own things. Then, pretending to be a deaf-mute, he would go\namong them to learn something of their customs and pick up the language.\nWhen he had done that, he would move on to another tribe or village,\nable to tell a credible story for himself. For a while, it would be\nnecessary for him to do menial work, but in the end, he would establish\nhimself among these people. Then he could gather around him a faction of\nthose who were dissatisfied with whatever conditions existed, organize a\nconspiracy, make arms for his followers, and start his program of\npower-seizure.\n\nThe matter of clothing was attended to shortly after he had crossed the\nmountain and descended into the valley on the other side. Hearing a\nclinking sound some distance from the road, as of metal striking stone,\nHradzka stole cautiously through the woods until he came within sight of\na man who was digging with a mattock, uprooting small bushes of a\nparticular sort, with rough gray bark and three-pointed leaves. When he\nhad dug one up, he would cut off the roots and then slice away the\nroot-bark with a knife, putting it into a sack. Hradzka's lip curled\ncontemptuously; the fellow was gathering the stuff for medicinal use. He\nhad heard of the use of roots and herbs for such purposes by the ancient\nsavages.\n\nThe blaster would be no use here; it was too powerful, and would destroy\nthe clothing that the man was wearing. He unfastened a strap from his\nbelt and attached it to a stone to form a hand-loop, then, inched\nforward behind the lone herb-gatherer. When he was close enough, he\nstraightened and rushed forward, swinging his improvised weapon. The man\nheard him and turned, too late.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter undressing his victim, Hradzka used the mattock to finish him, and\nthen to dig a grave. The fugitive buried his own clothes with the\nmurdered man, and donned the faded blue shirt, rough shoes, worn\ntrousers and jacket. The blaster he concealed under the jacket, and he\nkept a few other Hundredth Century gadgets; these he would hide\nsomewhere closer to his center of operations.\n\nHe had kept, among other things, a small box of food-concentrate\ncapsules, and in one pocket of the newly acquired jacket he found a\npackage containing food. It was rough and unappetizing fare--slices of\ncold cooked meat between slices of some cereal substance. He ate these\nbefore filling in the grave, and put the paper wrappings in with the\ndead man. Then, his work finished, he threw the mattock into the brush\nand set out again, grimacing disgustedly and scratching himself. The\nclothing he had appropriated was verminous.\n\nCrossing another mountain, he descended into a second valley, and, for a\ntime, lost his way among a tangle of narrow ravines. It was dark by the\ntime he mounted a hill and found himself looking down another valley, in\nwhich a few scattered lights gave evidence of human habitations. Not\nwishing to arouse suspicion by approaching these in the night-time, he\nfound a place among some young evergreens where he could sleep.\n\nThe next morning, having breakfasted on a concentrate capsule, he found\na hiding-place for his blaster in a hollow tree. It was in a\nsufficiently prominent position so that he could easily find it again,\nand at the same time unlikely to be discovered by some native. Then he\nwent down into the inhabited valley.\n\nHe was surprised at the ease with which he established contact with the\nnatives. The first dwelling which he approached, a cluster of\nfarm-buildings at the upper end of the valley, gave him shelter. There\nwas a man, clad in the same sort of rough garments Hradzka had taken\nfrom the body of the herb-gatherer, and a woman in a faded and shapeless\ndress. The man was thin and work-bent; the woman short and heavy. Both\nwere past middle age.\n\nHe made inarticulate sounds to attract their attention, then gestured to\nhis mouth and ears to indicate his assumed affliction. He rubbed his\nstomach to portray hunger. Looking about, he saw an ax sticking in a\nchopping-block, and a pile of wood near it, probably the fuel used by\nthese people. He took the ax, split up some of the wood, then repeated\nthe hunger-signs. The man and the woman both nodded, laughing; he was\nshown a pile of tree-limbs, and the man picked up a short billet of wood\nand used it like a measuring-rule, to indicate that all the wood was to\nbe cut to that length.\n\nHradzka fell to work, and by mid-morning, he had all the wood cut. He\nhad seen a circular stone, mounted on a trestle with a metal axle\nthrough it, and judged it to be some sort of a grinding-wheel, since it\nwas fitted with a foot-pedal and a rusty metal can was set above it to\nspill water onto the grinding-edge. After chopping the wood, he\ncarefully sharpened the ax, handing it to the man for inspection. This\nseemed to please the man; he clapped Hradzka on the shoulder, making\ncommendatory sounds.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt required considerable time and ingenuity to make himself a more or\nless permanent member of the household. Hradzka had made a survey of the\nfarmyard, noting the sorts of work that would normally be performed on\nthe farm, and he pantomimed this work in its simpler operations. He\npointed to the east, where the sun would rise, and to the zenith, and to\nthe west. He made signs indicative of eating, and of sleeping, and of\nrising, and of working. At length, he succeeded in conveying his\nmeaning.\n\nThere was considerable argument between the man and the woman, but his\nproposal was accepted, as he expected that it would. It was easy to see\nthat the work of the farm was hard for this aging couple; now, for a\nplace to sleep and a little food, they were able to acquire a strong and\nintelligent slave.\n\nIn the days that followed, he made himself useful to the farm people; he\nfed the chickens and the livestock, milked the cow, worked in the\nfields. He slept in a small room at the top of the house, under the\neaves, and ate with the man and woman in the farmhouse kitchen.\n\nIt was not long before he picked up a few words which he had heard his\nemployers using, and related them to the things or acts spoken of. And\nhe began to notice that these people, in spite of the crudities of their\nown life, enjoyed some of the advantages of a fairly complex\ncivilization. Their implements were not hand-craft products, but showed\nmachine workmanship. There were two objects hanging on hooks on the\nkitchen wall which he was sure were weapons. Both had wooden\nshoulder-stocks, and wooden fore-pieces; they had long tubes extending\nto the front, and triggers like blasters. One had double tubes mounted\nside-by-side, and double triggers; the other had an octagonal tube\nmounted over a round tube, and a loop extension on the trigger-guard.\nThen, there was a box on the kitchen wall, with a mouthpiece and a\ncylindrical tube on a cord. Sometimes a bell would ring out of the box,\nand the woman would go to this instrument, take down the tube and hold\nit to her ear, and talk into the mouthpiece. There was another box from\nwhich voices would issue, of people conversing, or of orators, or of\nsinging, and sometimes instrumental music. None of these were objects\nmade by savages; these people probably traded with some fairly high\ncivilization. They were not illiterate; he found printed matter,\nindicating the use of some phonetic alphabet, and paper pamphlets\ncontaining printed reproductions of photographs as well as verbal text.\n\nThere was also a vehicle on the farm, powered, like the one he had seen\non the road, by an engine in which a hydrocarbon liquid-fuel was\nexploded. He made it his business to examine this minutely, and to study\nits construction and operation until he was thoroughly familiar with it.\n\nIt was not until the third day after his arrival that the chickens began\nto die. In the morning, Hradzka found three of them dead when he went to\nfeed them, the rest drooping unhealthily; he summoned the man and showed\nhim what he had found. The next morning, they were all dead, and the cow\nwas sick. She gave bloody milk, that evening, and the next morning she\nlay in her stall and would not get up.\n\nThe man and the woman were also beginning to sicken, though both of them\ntried to continue their work. It was the woman who first noticed that\nthe plants around the farmhouse were withering and turning yellow.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe farmer went to the stable with Hradzka and looked at the cow.\nShaking his head, he limped back to the house, and returned carrying one\nof the weapons from the kitchen--the one with the single trigger and the\noctagonal tube. As he entered the stable, he jerked down and up on the\nloop extension of the trigger-guard, then put the weapon to his shoulder\nand pointed it at the cow. It made a flash, and roared louder even than\na hand-blaster, and the cow jerked convulsively and was dead. The man\nthen indicated by signs that Hradzka was to drag the dead cow out of the\nstable, dig a hole, and bury it. This Hradzka did, carefully examining\nthe wound in the cow's head--the weapon, he decided, was not an\nenergy-weapon, but a simple solid-missile projector.\n\nBy evening, neither the man nor the woman were able to eat,\nand both seemed to be suffering intensely. The man used the\ncommunicating-instrument on the wall, probably calling on his friends\nfor help. Hradzka did what he could to make them comfortable, cooked his\nown meal, washed the dishes as he had seen the woman doing, and tidied\nup the kitchen.\n\nIt was not long before people, men and women whom he had seen on the\nroad or who had stopped at the farmhouse while he had been there, began\narriving, some carrying baskets of food; and shortly after Hradzka had\neaten, a vehicle like the farmer's, but in better condition and of\nbetter quality, arrived and a young man got out of it and entered the\nhouse, carrying a leather bag. He was apparently some sort of a\nscientist; he examined the man and his wife, asked many questions, and\nadministered drugs. He also took samples for blood-tests and urinalysis.\nThis, Hradzka considered, was another of the many contradictions he had\nencountered among these people--this man behaved like an educated\nscientist, and seemingly had nothing in common with the peasant\nherb-gatherer on the mountainside.\n\nThe fact was that Hradzka was worried. The strange death of the animals,\nthe blight which had smitten the trees and vegetables around the farm,\nand the sickness of the farmer and his woman, all mystified him. He did\nnot know of any disease which would affect plants and animals and\nhumans; he wondered if some poisonous gas might not be escaping from the\nearth near the farmhouse. However, he had not, himself, been affected.\nHe also disliked the way in which the doctor and the neighbors seemed to\nbe talking about him. While he had come to a considerable revision of\nhis original opinion about the culture-level of these people, it was not\nimpossible that they might suspect him of having caused the whole thing\nby witchcraft; at any moment, they might fall upon him and put him to\ndeath. In any case, there was no longer any use in his staying here, and\nit might be wise if he left at once.\n\nAccordingly, he filled his pockets with food from the pantry and slipped\nout of the farmhouse; before his absence was discovered he was well on\nhis way down the road.\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nThat night, Hradzka slept under a bridge across a fairly wide stream;\nthe next morning, he followed the road until he came to a town. It was\nnot a large place; there were perhaps four or five hundred houses and\nother buildings in it. Most of these were dwellings like the farmhouse\nwhere he had been staying, but some were much larger, and seemed to be\nplaces of business. One of these latter was a concrete structure with\nwide doors at the front; inside, he could see men working on the\ninternal-combustion vehicles which seemed to be in almost universal use.\nHradzka decided to obtain employment here.\n\nIt would be best, he decided, to continue his pretense of being a\ndeaf-mute. He did not know whether a world-language were in use at this\ntime or not, and even if not, the pretense of being a foreigner unable\nto speak the local dialect might be dangerous. So he entered the\nvehicle-repair shop and accosted a man in a clean shirt who seemed to be\nissuing instructions to the workers, going into his pantomime of the\nhomeless mute seeking employment.\n\nThe master of the repair-shop merely laughed at him, however. Hradzka\nbecame more insistent in his manner, making signs to indicate his hunger\nand willingness to work. The other men in the shop left their tasks and\ngathered around; there was much laughter and unmistakably ribald and\nderogatory remarks. Hradzka was beginning to give up hope of getting\nemployment here when one of the workmen approached the master and\nwhispered something to him.\n\nThe two of them walked away, conversing in low voices. Hradzka thought\nhe understood the situation; no doubt the workman, thinking to lighten\nhis own labor, was urging that the vagrant be employed, for no other pay\nthan food and lodging. At length, the master assented to his employee's\nurgings; he returned, showed Hradzka a hose and a bucket and sponges and\ncloths, and set him to work cleaning the mud from one of the vehicles.\nThen, after seeing that the work was being done properly, he went away,\nentering a room at one side of the shop.\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, another man entered the shop. He was not\ndressed like any of the other people whom Hradzka had seen; he wore a\ngray tunic and breeches, polished black boots, and a cap with a visor\nand a metal insignia on it; on a belt, he carried a holstered weapon\nlike a blaster.\n\nAfter speaking to one of the workers, who pointed Hradzka out to him, he\napproached the fugitive and said something. Hradzka made gestures at his\nmouth and ears and made gargling sounds; the newcomer shrugged and\nmotioned him to come with him, at the same time producing a pair of\nhandcuffs from his belt and jingling them suggestively.\n\nIn a few seconds, Hradzka tried to analyze the situation and estimate\nits possibilities. The newcomer was a soldier, or, more likely, a\npoliceman, since manacles were a part of his equipment. Evidently, since\nthe evening before, a warning had been made public by means of\ncommunicating devices such as he had seen at the farm, advising people\nthat a man of his description, pretending to be a deaf-mute, should be\ndetained and the police notified; it had been for that reason that the\nworkman had persuaded his master to employ Hradzka. No doubt he would be\naccused of causing the conditions at the farm by sorcery.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHradzka shrugged and nodded, then went to the water-tap to turn off the\nhose he had been using. He disconnected it, coiled it and hung it up,\nand then picked up the water-bucket. Then, without warning, he hurled\nthe water into the policeman's face, sprang forward, swinging the bucket\nby the bale, and hit the man on the head. Releasing his grip on the\nbucket, he tore the blaster or whatever it was from the holster.\n\nOne of the workers swung a hammer, as though to throw it. Hradzka aimed\nthe weapon at him and pulled the trigger; the thing belched fire and\nkicked back painfully in his hand, and the man fell. He used it again to\ndrop the policeman, then thrust it into the waistband of his trousers\nand ran outside. The thing was not a blaster at all, he realized--only a\nmissile-projector like the big weapons at the farm, utilizing the force\nof some chemical explosive.\n\nThe policeman's vehicle was standing outside. It was a small,\nsingle-seat, two wheeled affair. Having become familiar with the\nprinciples of these hydro-carbon engines from examination of the vehicle\nof the farm, and accustomed as he was to far more complex mechanisms\nthan this crude affair, Hradzka could see at a glance how to operate it.\nSpringing onto the saddle, he kicked away the folding support and\nstarted the engine. Just as he did, the master of the repair-shop ran\noutside, one of the small hand-weapons in his hand, and fired several\nshots. They all missed, but Hradzka heard the whining sound of the\nmissiles passing uncomfortably close to him.\n\nIt was imperative that he recover the blaster he had hidden in the\nhollow tree at the head of the valley. By this time, there would be a\nconcerted search under way for him, and he needed a better weapon than\nthe solid-missile projector he had taken from the policeman. He did not\nknow how many shots the thing contained, but if it propelled solid\nmissiles by chemical explosion, there could not have been more than five\nor six such charges in the cylindrical part of the weapon which he had\nassumed to be the charge-holder. On the other hand, his blaster, a\nweapon of much greater power, contained enough energy for five hundred\nblasts, and with it were eight extra energy-capsules, giving him a total\nof four thousand five hundred blasts.\n\nHandling the two-wheeled vehicle was no particular problem; although he\nhad never ridden on anything of the sort before, it was child's play\ncompared to controlling a Hundredth Century strato-rocket, and Hradzka\nwas a skilled rocket-pilot.\n\nSeveral times he passed vehicles on the road--the passenger vehicles\nwith enclosed cabins, and cargo-vehicles piled high with farm produce.\nOnce he encountered a large number of children, gathered in front of a\nbig red building with a flagstaff in front, from which a queer flag,\nwith horizontal red and white stripes and a white-spotted blue device in\nthe corner, flew. They scattered off the road in terror at his approach;\nfortunately, he hit none of them, for at the speed at which he was\ntraveling, such a collision would have wrecked his light vehicle.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs he approached the farm where he had spent the past few days, he saw\ntwo passenger-vehicles standing by the road. One was a black one,\nsimilar to the one in which the physician had come to the farm, and the\nother was white with black trimmings and bore the same device he had\nseen on the cap of the policeman. A policeman was sitting in the\ndriver's seat of this vehicle, and another policeman was standing beside\nit, breathing smoke with one of the white paper cylinders these people\nused. In the farm-yard, two men were going about with a square black\nbox; to this box, a tube was connected by a wire, and they were passing\nthe tube about over the ground.\n\nThe policeman who was standing beside the vehicle saw him approach, and\nblew his whistle, then drew the weapon from his belt. Hradzka, who had\nbeen expecting some attempt to halt him, had let go the right-hand\nsteering handle and drawn his own weapon; as the policeman drew, he\nfired at him. Without observing the effect of the shot, he sped on;\nbefore he had rounded the bend above the farm, several shots were fired\nafter him.\n\nA mile beyond, he came to the place where he had hidden the blaster. He\nstopped the vehicle and jumped off, plunging into the brush and racing\ntoward the hollow tree. Just as he reached it, he heard a vehicle\napproach and stop, and the door of the police vehicle slam. Hradzka's\nfingers found the belt of his blaster; he dragged it out and buckled it\non, tossing away the missile weapon he had been carrying.\n\nThen, crouching behind the tree, he waited. A few moments later, he\ncaught a movement in the brush toward the road. He brought up the\nblaster, aimed and squeezed the trigger. There was a faint bluish glow\nat the muzzle, and a blast of energy tore through the brush, smashing\nthe molecular structure of everything that stood in the way. There was\nan involuntary shout of alarm from the direction of the road; at least\none of the policemen had escaped the blast. Hradzka holstered his weapon\nand crept away for some distance, keeping under cover, then turned and\nwaited for some sign of the presence of his enemies. For some time\nnothing happened; he decided to turn hunter against the men who were\nhunting him. He started back in the direction of the road, making a wide\ncircle, flitting silently from rock to bush and from bush to tree,\nstopping often to look and listen.\n\nThis finally brought him upon one of the policemen, and almost\nterminated his flight at the same time. He must have grown\nover-confident and careless; suddenly a weapon roared, and a missile\nsmashed through the brush inches from his face. The shot had come from\nhis left and a little to the rear. Whirling, he blasted four times, in\nrapid succession, then turned and fled for a few yards, dropping and\ncrawling behind a rock. When he looked back, he could see wisps of smoke\nrising from the shattered trees and bushes which had absorbed the\nenergy-output of his weapon, and he caught a faint odor of burned flesh.\nOne of his pursuers, at least, would pursue him no longer.\n\nHe slipped away, down into the tangle of ravines and hollows in which he\nhad wandered the day before his arrival at the farm. For the time being,\nhe felt safe, and finally confident that he was not being pursued, he\nstopped to rest. The place where he stopped seemed familiar, and he\nlooked about. In a moment, he recognized the little stream, the pool\nwhere he had bathed his feet, the clump of seedling pines under which he\nhad slept. He even found the silver-foil wrapping from the food\nconcentrate capsule.\n\nBut there had been a change, since the night when he had slept here.\nThen the young pines had been green and alive; now they were blighted,\nand their needles had turned brown. Hradzka stood for a long time,\nlooking at them. It was the same blight that had touched the plants\naround the farmhouse. And here, among the pine needles on the ground,\nlay a dead bird.\n\nIt took some time for him to admit, to himself, the implications of\nvegetation, the chickens, the cow, the farmer and his wife, had all\nsickened and died. He had been in this place, and now, when he had\nreturned, he found that death had followed him here, too.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDuring the early centuries of the Atomic Era, he knew, there had been\ngreat wars, the stories of which had survived even to the Hundredth\nCentury. Among the weapons that had been used, there had been artificial\nplagues and epidemics, caused by new types of bacteria developed in\nlaboratories, against which the victims had possessed no protection.\nThose germs and viruses had persisted for centuries, and gradually had\nlost their power to harm mankind. Suppose, now, that he had brought some\nof them back with him, to a century before they had been developed.\nSuppose, that was, that he were a human plague-carrier. He thought of\nthe vermin that had infested the clothing he had taken from the man he\nhad killed on the other side of the mountain; they had not troubled him\nafter the first day.\n\nThere was a throbbing mechanical sound somewhere in the air; he looked\nabout, and finally identified its source. A small aircraft had come over\nthe valley from the other side of the mountain and was circling lazily\noverhead. He froze, shrinking back under a pine-tree; as long as he\nremained motionless, he would not be seen, and soon the thing would go\naway. He was beginning to understand why the search for him was being\npressed so relentlessly; as long as he remained alive, he was a menace\nto everybody in this First Century world.\n\nHe got out his supply of food concentrates, saw that he had only three\ncapsules left, and put them away again. For a long time, he sat under\nthe dying tree, chewing on a twig and thinking. There must be some way\nin which he could overcome, or even utilize, his inherent deadliness to\nthese people. He might find some isolated community, conceal himself\nnear it, invade it at night and infect it, and then, when everybody was\ndead, move in and take it for himself. But was there any such isolated\ncommunity? The farmhouse where he had worked had been fairly remote, yet\nits inhabitants had been in communication with the outside world, and\nthe physician had come immediately in response to their call for help.\n\nThe little aircraft had been circling overhead, directly above the place\nwhere he lay hidden. For a while, Hradzka was afraid it had spotted him,\nand was debating the advisability of using his blaster on it. Then it\nbanked, turned and went away. He watched it circle over the valley on\nthe other side of the mountain, and got to his feet.\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nAlmost at once, there was a new sound--a multiple throbbing, at a quick,\nsnarling tempo that hinted at enormous power, growing louder each\nsecond. Hradzka stiffened and drew his blaster; as he did, five more\naircraft swooped over the crest of the mountain and came rushing down\ntoward him; not aimlessly, but as though they knew exactly where he was.\nAs they approached, the leading edges of their wings sparkled with\nlight, branches began flying from the trees about him, and there was a\nloud hammering noise.\n\nHe aimed a little in front of them and began blasting. A wing flew from\none of the aircraft, and it plunged downward. Another came apart in the\nair; a third burst into flames. The other two zoomed upward quickly.\nHradzka swung his blaster after them, blasting again and again. He hit a\nfourth with a blast of energy, knocking it to pieces, and then the fifth\nwas out of range. He blasted at it twice, but without effect; a\nhand-blaster was only good for a thousand yards at the most.\n\nHolstering his weapon, he hurried away, following the stream and keeping\nunder cover of trees. The last of the attacking aircraft had gone away,\nbut the little scout-plane was still circling about, well out of\nblaster-range.\n\nOnce or twice, Hradzka was compelled to stay hidden for some time, not\nknowing the nature of the pilot's ability to detect him. It was during\none of these waits that the next phase of the attack developed.\n\nIt began, like the last one, with a distant roar that swelled in volume\nuntil it seemed to fill the whole world. Then, fifteen or twenty\nthousand feet out of blaster-range, the new attackers swept into sight.\n\nThere must have been fifty of them, huge tapering things with\nwide-spread wings, flying in close formation, wave after V-shaped wave.\nHe stood and stared at them, amazed; he had never imagined that such\naircraft existed in the First Century. Then a high-pitched screaming\nsound cut through the roar of the propellers, and for an instant he saw\ncountless small specks in the sky, falling downward.\n\nThe first bomb-salvo landed in the young pines, where he had fought\nagainst the first air attack. Great gouts of flame shot upward, and\nsmoke, and flying earth and debris. Hradzka turned and started to run.\nAnother salvo fell in front of him; he veered to the left and plunged on\nthrough the undergrowth. Now the bombs were falling all about him,\ndeafening him with their thunder, shaking him with concussion. He\ndodged, frightened, as the trunk of a tree came crashing down beside\nhim. Then something hit him across the back, knocking him flat. For a\nmoment, he lay stunned, then tried to rise. As he did, a searing light\nfilled his eyes and a wave of intolerable heat swept over him. Then\ndarkness...\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"No, Zarvas Pol,\" Kradzy Zago repeated. \"Hradzka will not return; the\n'time-machine' was sabotaged.\"\n\n\"So? By you?\" the soldier asked.\n\nThe scientist nodded. \"I knew the purpose for which he intended it.\nHradzka was not content with having enslaved a whole Solar System: he\nhungered to bring tyranny and serfdom to all the past and all the future\nas well; he wanted to be master not only of the present but of the\ncenturies that were and were to be, as well. I never took part in\npolitics, Zarvas Pol; I had no hand in this revolt. But I could not be\nparty to such a crime as Hradzka contemplated when it lay within my\npower to prevent it.\"\n\n\"The machine will take him out of our space-time continuum, or back to a\ntime when this planet was a swirling cloud of flaming gas?\" Zarvas Pol\nasked.\n\nKradzy Zago shook his head. \"No, the unit is not powerful enough for\nthat. It will only take him about ten thousand years into the past. But\nthen, when it stops, the machine will destroy itself. It may destroy\nHradzka with it or he may escape. But if he does, he will be left\nstranded ten thousand years ago, when he can do us no harm.\n\n\"Actually, it did not operate as he imagined and there is an infinitely\nsmall chance that he could have returned to our 'time', in any event.\nBut I wanted to insure against even so small a chance.\"\n\n\"We can't be sure of that,\" Zarvas Pol objected. \"He may know more about\nthe machine than you think; enough more to build another like it. So you\nmust build me a machine and I'll take back a party of volunteers and\nhunt him down.\"\n\n\"That would not be necessary, and you would only share his fate.\" Then,\napparently changing the subject, Kradzy Zago asked: \"Tell me, Zarvas\nPol; have you never heard the legends of the Deadly Radiations?\"\n\nGeneral Zarvas smiled. \"Who has not? Every cadet at the Officers'\nCollege dreams of re-discovering them, to use as a weapon, but nobody\never has. We hear these tales of how, in the early days, atomic engines\nand piles and fission-bombs emitted particles which were utterly deadly,\nwhich would make anything with which they came in contact deadly, which\nwould bring a horrible death to any human being. But these are only\nmyths. All the ancient experiments have been duplicated time and again,\nand the deadly radiation effect has never been observed. Some say that\nit is a mere old-wives' terror tale; some say that the deaths were\ncaused by fear of atomic energy, when it was still unfamiliar; others\ncontend that the fundamental nature of atomic energy has altered by the\ndegeneration of the fissionable matter. For my own part, I'm not enough\nof a scientist to have an opinion.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe old one smiled wanly. \"None of these theories are correct. In the\nbeginning of the Atomic Era, the Deadly Radiations existed. They still\nexist, but they are no longer deadly, because all life on this planet\nhas adapted itself to such radiations, and all living things are now\nimmune to them.\"\n\n\"And Hradzka has returned to a time when such immunity did not exist?\nBut would that not be to his advantage?\"\n\n\"Remember, General, that man has been using atomic energy for ten\nthousand years. Our whole world has become drenched with radioactivity.\nThe planet, the seas, the atmosphere, and every living thing, are all\nradioactive, now. Radioactivity is as natural to us as the air we\nbreathe. Now, you remember hearing of the great wars of the first\ncenturies of the Atomic Era, in which whole nations were wiped out,\nleaving only hundreds of survivors out of millions. You, no doubt, think\nthat such tales are products of ignorant and barbaric imagination, but I\nassure you, they are literally true. It was not the blast-effect of a\nfew bombs which created such holocausts, but the radiations released by\nthe bombs. And those who survived to carry on the race were men and\nwomen whose systems resisted the radiations, and they transmitted to\ntheir progeny that power of resistance. In many cases, their children\nwere mutants--not monsters, although there were many of them, too, which\ndid not survive--but humans who were immune to radioactivity.\"\n\n\"An interesting theory, Kradzy Zago,\" the soldier commented. \"And one\nwhich conforms both to what we know of atomic energy and to the ancient\nlegends. Then you would say that those radiations are still deadly--to\nthe non-immune?\"\n\n\"Exactly. And Hradzka, his body emitting those radiations, has returned\nto the First Century of the Atomic Era--to a world without immunity.\"\n\nGeneral Zarvas' smile vanished. \"Man!\" he cried in horror. \"You have\nloosed a carrier of death among those innocent people of the past!\"\n\nKradzy Zago nodded. \"That is true. I estimate that Hradzka will probably\ncause the death of a hundred or so people, before he is dealt with. But\ndealt with he will be. Tell me, General; if a man should appear now, out\nof nowhere, spreading a strange and horrible plague wherever he went,\nwhat would you do?\"\n\n\"Why, I'd hunt him down and kill him,\" General Zarvas replied. \"Not for\nanything he did, but for the menace he was. And then, I'd cover his body\nwith a mass of concrete bigger than this palace.\"\n\n\"Precisely.\" Kradzy Zago smiled. \"And the military commanders and\npolitical leaders of the First Century were no less ruthless or\nefficient than you. You know how atomic energy was first used? There was\nan ancient nation, upon the ruins of whose cities we have built our own,\nwhich was famed for its idealistic humanitarianism. Yet that nation,\ntreacherously attacked, created the first atomic bombs in self defense,\nand used them. It is among the people of that nation that Hradzka has\nemerged.\"\n\n\"But would they recognize him as the cause of the calamity he brings\namong them?\"\n\n\"Of course. He will emerge at the time when atomic energy is first being\nused. They will have detectors for the Deadly Radiations--detectors we\nknow nothing of, today, for a detection instrument must be free from the\nthing it is intended to detect, and today everything is radioactive. It\nwill be a day or so before they discover what is happening to them, and\nnot a few will die in that time, I fear; but once they have found out\nwhat is killing their people, Hradzka's days--no, his hours--will be\nnumbered.\"\n\n\"A mass of concrete bigger than this place,\" Tobbh the Slave repeated\nGeneral Zarvas' words. \"_The Ancient Spaceport!_\"\n\nPrince Burvanny clapped him on the shoulder. \"Tobbh, man! You've hit\nit!\"\n\n\"You mean...?\" Kradzy Zago began.\n\n\"Yes. You all know of it. It's stood for nobody knows how many\nmillennia, and nobody's ever decided what it was, to begin with, except\nthat somebody, once, filled a valley with concrete, level from\nmountain-top to mountain-top. The accepted theory is that it was done\nfor a firing-stand for the first Moon-rocket. But gentlemen, our friend\nTobbh's explained it. It is the tomb of Hradzka, and it has been the\ntomb of Hradzka for ten thousand years before Hradzka was born!\"\n\n\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------+\n|Transcriber's Note                                            |\n|                                                              |\n|                                                              |\n| This etext was produced from \"Future\" combined with \"Science |\n| Fiction Stories\" September/October 1950.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
