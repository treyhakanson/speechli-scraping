A natural\necology was being maintained on World 7 as a control for experimental\nseedings of intelligent life-forms in other similar worlds. How the Harn\ngot there, the Warden never knew. In its free-moving larval state, the\nHarn was a ticklike creature which might have sifted through a natural\ninter-dimensional rift; or it might have come through as a hitchhiker on\nsome legitimate traveler, possibly even the Warden himself._\n\n_In any event, it was there now. Free of natural enemies and\ncompetition, it had expanded enormously. So far, the effect in the\ncontrol world was localized, but this would not be the case when the\nHarn seeded. Prompt action was indicated._\n\n_The Warden's inclination and training was in the direction of avoiding\ndirect intervention in the ecology of the worlds under his\njurisdiction, even in the field of predator control. He considered\nintroduction of natural enemies of the Harn from its own world, and\ndecided against it. That cure was as bad, if not worse, than the disease\nitself._\n\n_There was, however, in one adjacent world, a life-form not normally\nassociated with the Harn; but which analysis indicated would be inimical\nto it, and reasonably amenable to control._\n\n_It was worth trying, anyway._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOctober 3rd, Ed Brown got up to the base cabin of his trap line with his\nwinter's outfit.\n\nHe hung an N. C. Company calendar on the wall and started marking off\nthe days.\n\nOctober 8th, the hole into the other world opened.\n\nIn the meantime, of course, Ed had not been idle. All summer the cabin\nhad stood empty. He got his bedding, stove, and other cabin gear down\nfrom the cache and made the place livable. The mice were thick, a good\nfur sign, but a nuisance otherwise. Down in the cellar hole, when he\nwent to clear it out for the new spud crop, he found burrowings\neverywhere.\n\nWell, old Tom would take care of that in short order. Tom was a big,\nblack, bobtailed cat eleven years old who had lived with Ed since he was\na kitten. Not having any feline companionship to distract him, his only\ninterest was hunting mice. Generally he killed a lot more than he could\neat, racking the surplus in neat piles beside the trail, on the\ndoorstep, or on a slab in the cellar. He was the best mouser in interior\nAlaska.\n\nEd propped the cellar hatch with a stick so old Tom could come and go as\nhe pleased, and went on about his chores, working with a methodical\nefficiency that matched Tom's and went with his thinning gray hair and\nforty years in the woods. He dug the spuds he had planted that spring.\nHe made a swing around his beaver lakes, tallying the blankets in each\nhouse. He took the canoe and moved supplies to his upper cabin. He\nharvested some fat mallards that had moved down on the river with the\ncoming of skim ice on the lakes. He bucked up firewood and stacked it to\nmove into camp with the first snow.\n\nOn the fifth morning, as he was going down to the boat landing with a\npail for water, he found the hole into the other world.\n\nEd had never seen a hole into another world, of course, nor even heard\nof such a thing. He was as surprised as any one would naturally be to\nfind one not fifty feet from their front door.\n\nStill, his experience had been all in the direction of believing what\nhis eyes told him. He had seen a lot of strange things in his life, and\none more didn't strain him too much. He stood stockstill where he had\nfirst noticed the hole and studied it warily.\n\nIt was two steps off the trail to the left, right beside the old leaning\nbirch, a rectangular piece of scenery that did not fit. It looked to be,\nas nearly as he could judge, about man-size, six by three. At the\nbottom it was easy enough to see where this world left off and that one\nbegan. On the left side the two worlds matched pretty well, but on the\nright side there was a niggerhead in this world, the moss-covered relic\nof a centuries old stump, while that world continued level, so that the\nniggerhead was neatly sliced in two. Also, the vegetation was different,\nmossy on this side, grassy on that.\n\nOn up around the hole, though, it was harder to tell. There was no\nclear-cut line, just the difference in what you could see through it. In\nthe other world, the ground seemed to fall away, with low scrubby brush\nin the foreground. Then, a mile or so away, there were rising hills with\nhardwood forests of some kind, still green with summer, covering them.\n\nEd stepped cautiously to one side. The view through the hole narrowed,\nas if it faced the trail squarely. He edged around the old birch to get\nbehind it, and from that side there was no hole, just the same old\nAlaskan scenery, birch and rose bushes and spruce. From the front,\nthough, it was still there.\n\nHe cut an alder shoot about eight feet long, trimmed it, and poked it\nthrough the hole. It went through easily enough. He prodded at the sod\nin the other world, digging up small tufts. When he pulled the stick\nback, some of the other world dirt was on the sharp end. It looked and\nsmelled just about like any dirt.\n\nOld Tom came stretching out into the morning sun and stalked over to\ninvestigate. After a careful inspection of the hole he settled down with\nhis paws tucked under him to watch. Ed took a flat round can from his\npocket, lined his lip frugally with snuff, and sat down on the up-ended\nbucket to watch too. At the moment, that seemed the likeliest thing to\ndo.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_It was nearly swarming time, the Harn had many things to preoccupy it,\nbut it spared one unit to watch the hole into the other world. So far,\nnothing much had happened. A large biped had found the opening from the\nother side. It had been joined by a smaller quadruped; but neither\nshowed any indication yet of coming through. The sun was shining through\nthe hole, a large young yellow sun, and the air was crisp, with sharp\ninteresting odors._\n\n_The biped ejected a thin squirt of brown liquid through the hole--venom\nof some sort, apparently. The Harn hastily drew back out of range._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe hole into the other world stayed there, as unobtrusively fixed as if\nit had been there since the beginning of time. Nothing came through, and\nnothing moved in the other world but leaves stirring now and then with a\nbreeze, clouds drifting across the sky. Ed began to realize it was\ngetting late in the morning, and he had not yet had breakfast. He left\nold Tom to watch the hole, got stiffly to his feet and went on down the\ntrail to get the pail of water he had started for. From the cabin door,\nhe could still see the hole into the other world. He kept one eye on it\nwhile he cooked breakfast.\n\nAs he was finishing his second cup of coffee, he noticed the view into\nthe other world becoming duller, dimming in a peculiar fashion. He left\nthe dirty dishes and went over to look more closely. What was happening,\nhe found, was just that it was getting dark in the other world. The\neffect was strange, much like looking out the door of a brightly lighted\nroom at dusk. The edges of the hole cast a very clearly marked shadow\nnow, and outside this shaft of sunlight the view faded, until a few\nyards away it was impossible to make out any detail.\n\nPresently the stars came out. Ed was not an astronomer, but he had a\nwoodsman's knowledge of the sky. He could find nothing familiar in any\nof the stars he saw. In some way, that was more unsettling than the hole\nitself had been.\n\nAfter he had finished the dishes, he cut two gee-pole spruce, trimmed\nthem, and stuck one on each side of the hole. He got some thin thread he\nused to tie beaver snares and wove it back and forth between the poles,\nrigging a tin can alarm. It seemed likely someone or something had put\nthe hole there, it had not just happened. If anything came through, Ed\nwanted to know about it. Just to make extra sure, he got some number\nthree traps and made a few blind sets in front of the hole.\n\nThen he went back to his chores. Whatever was going to happen with the\nhole would happen when it happened, and winter was still coming.\n\nHe set some babiche to soak for mending his snowshoes. He ran the net he\nhad set at the edge of the eddy for late silvers and took out two fish.\nOld Tom had pretty well cleaned up the mice in the cellar hole, but they\nwere still burrowing around the sills of the lean-to. Ed took a shovel\nand opened up a hole so Tom could get under the lean-to floor. He got\nout his needles, palm, thread, and wax; and mended his winter moccasins.\n\nOff and on, he checked the hole into the other world. There was nothing\nbut the slow progression of alien stars across the sky. Finally old Tom\ngrew bored and left to investigate the hole under the lean-to. Shortly\nthere were scutterings and squeakings as evidence that he, too, had got\nback to business.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nToward evening, Ed got to wondering how a living creature would take\ntransition into the other world. He had no intention of trying it\nhimself until he knew a lot more about it, but he thought he might be\nable to scare up a surrogate. Out by the wood pile some live-traps were\npiled under a spruce, from the time when Ed had been catching marten for\nthe Fish and Wildlife to transplant. One was still in pretty fair shape.\nHe patched it up and set it among the cottonwoods at the head of the\nbar, where there were some rabbit trails.\n\nWhen he went to bed it was still dark in the other world. He left the\ncabin door ajar so he could see it from his bed and set his shotgun,\nloaded with 00 buck, handy.\n\nNearing sixty, Ed was not a sound sleeper, even when he had nothing on\nhis mind. About ten it started to get light in the other world, and that\nwoke him up. He padded out to look, but there was no change, it looked\nabout the same as yesterday. He went back to bed.\n\nThe next morning there was a rabbit in the live-trap. With a pole, Ed\npushed the trap with the rabbit in it through into the other world and\nwatched. Nothing happened. After a while the rabbit began nibbling at\nsome spears of grass that pushed through the wire of the cage. Ed pulled\nit back and examined the rabbit carefully. It seemed healthy and about\nas happy as a rabbit could expect to be in a cage.\n\nIt did not get dark in the other world till about noon, that day; and\nabout seven, when it was dark in both worlds, Ed heard the jangle of the\ntin can alarm, followed by the snap of one of the steel traps.\n\nHe took a flashlight and found a small hoofed animal, hardly bigger than\nold Tom, rearing and bucking with a broken leg in the trap. It had sharp\nlittle spike horns, only a few inches long, but mean. Ed got several\npainful jabs before he got the animal tied up and out of the trap. He\nrestrung the alarm, then took his catch into the cabin to examine.\n\nIt was herbivorous and adult, from the looks of its teeth and hoofs,\nthough it only weighed about fifteen pounds. As an approximation, Ed\ndecided it was female. When he killed it and opened it up, at first\nglance it looked reasonably familiar, on closer study less so.\n\nThe blood, anyway, was red; not blue or yellow or green; and the bones\nwere bones, just odd-shaped.\n\nEd cut off a slice of heart and tossed it to old Tom. The cat sniffed it\ndubiously and then decided he liked it. He meowed for more. Ed gave it\nto him and fried a small sliver of ham. It smelled and tasted fine, but\nEd contented himself with a single delicate nibble, pending further\ndevelopments. Anyway, it was beginning to look like a little exploration\nwould be feasible.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_The Harn, also, was well-satisfied with the way things were going. It\nhad been a strain to pass up the juicy little quadruped in the cage, but\nthe inhabitants of the other world seemed shy, and the Harn did not wish\nto frighten them. At least, it knew now that life could come through the\nhole, and the small herbivore it had herded through confirmed that\npassage in the opposite direction was equally possible--plus a gratis\ndemonstration of the other world's pitiful defenses. At swarming time,\nthe whole new world would be open to embryo Harn, as well as this world\nit presently occupied._\n\n_It looked like a really notable swarming. The Harn budded three more\nplanters on the forcing stem, to be ready to take full advantage of\nit._\n\nIt got light in the other world at one in the morning that night. Ed had\nthe days there pretty well pegged now. They were roughly twenty-seven\nhours, of which about thirteen hours were dark. Not too high a latitude,\napparently, and probably late summer by the looks of the vegetation.\n\nHe got up a little before daylight and looked at the rabbit and old Tom.\nBoth seemed to be doing nicely. Old Tom was hungry for more otherworld\nmeat. Ed gave it to him and made up a light pack. After some thought, he\ntook the .450 bear gun he used for back-up when guiding. Whatever he ran\ninto over there, the .450--a model 71 throwing a 400 grain slug at 2100\nfps--should handle it.\n\nThe first step through into the other world was a queasy one, but it\nturned out to be much the same as any other step. The only difference\nwas that now he was in the other world looking back. From this side, the\nniggerhead at the threshold was sliced sharply, but it had been kicked\ndown a little when he came through, and what with shoving the cage\nthrough and pulling it back, so that some clods of moss and dirt were\nscattered in the other world. For some reason, that made Ed feel better,\nit seemed to make the joining of the two worlds a little more permanent.\n\nStill, it had come sudden, and it might go sudden. Ed went back into his\nown world and got an ax, a saw, more ammunition, salt, a heavy sleeping\nrobe, a few other possibles. He brought them through and piled them in\nthe other world, covering them with a scrap of old tarp. He cut a couple\nof poles, peeled them, and stuck them in the ground to mark the hole\nfrom this side.\n\nThen he looked around.\n\nHe stood on the shoulder of a hill, in a game trail that ran down toward\na stream below, in what seemed to be a fairly recent burn. There were\ncharred stumps, and the growth was small stuff, with some saplings\npushing up through. There was timber in the valley below, though, and on\nthe hills beyond, deciduous, somewhat like oak. South was where east had\nbeen in his own world, and the sun seemed smaller, but brighter. The sky\nwas a very dark blue. He seemed lighter in this world, there was a\nspring in his step he had not known for twenty years. He looked at his\ncompass. It checked with the direction of the sun.\n\nHe studied the trail. It had seen a lot of use, but less in recent\nweeks. There were sharp hoof-prints of the animal he had caught, larger\nhoof-prints, vague pad-marks of various sizes, but nothing that looked\nhuman. The trail went under a charred tree trunk at a height that was\nnot comfortable for a man, and the spacing of the steps around the\ngnarled roots of an old slump did not fit a man's stride.\n\nHe did not notice the Harn creature at all--which was understandable, it\nwas well camouflaged.\n\nHe worked circumspectly down the trail, staying a little off it,\nstudying tracks and droppings, noticing evidences of browsing on the\nshrubs--mostly old--pausing to examine tufts of hair and an occasional\nfeather. Halfway down the slope he flushed a bird about ptarmigan-size,\ngrayish brown in color.\n\nThe trail was more marked where it went into the timber. It wound\nthrough the trees for a few hundred yards and came out on a canoe-sized\nstream. Here it forked. One trail crossed the stream and went up the\nhill on the other side, the other followed the stream up the valley.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_The Harn followed Ed's movements, observing carefully. It needed a\nspecimen from the other world, and this biped would serve nicely, but it\nmight as well learn as much as possible about him first. It could always\npick him up some time before he returned to his own world. Just to make\nsure, it sent a stinging unit to guard the entrance._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll his life, except for a short period in France, Ed had been a hunter,\nnever hunted. Still, you don't grow old in the woods by jumping without\nlooking. Coming into a new situation, he was wary as an old wolf. There\nwas a little shoulder right above the fork in the trail. He stood there\nfor several minutes, looking things over, and then went down and crossed\nthe stream at the next riffle, above the ford. By doing so, although he\ndid not know it, he missed the trap the Harn maintained at the ford for\nchance passers-by.\n\nOn the other side of the creek, the trail ran angling off downstream,\nskirted a small lake hidden in the trees, climbed over another low\nshoulder and dropped into a second valley. As Ed followed along it, he\nbegan to notice a few more signs of life--birds, small scurriers on the\nground and in tree tops--and this set him thinking. The country had a\npicked-over feel to it, a hunted and trapped-out feel, worse where he\nhad first come through, but still noticeable here.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_The Harn did not like to cross water, it could, but it did not like\nto._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEd looked at the sun. It was getting down in the sky. If there was any\nactivity at all around here, the ford at dusk would be as likely a place\nas any to find it. He worked back along the ridge to a point above where\nhe judged the ford to be. The breeze was drawing up the valley, but\nfavoring the other side a little. He dropped down and crossed the stream\na quarter mile above the ford, climbed well above the trail and worked\nalong the hillside until he was in a position where he could watch both\nthe ford and the fork in the trail. He squatted down against a tree in a\ncomfortable position, laid his gun across his knees, and rummaged in his\npack for the cold flapjacks, wrapped around slices of duck breast, which\nhe had packed for lunch.\n\nAfter he had finished eating he drank from his canteen--the water in\nthis world might be good, it might not, there was no point in taking\nchances till he could try it on the cat--and took an economical chew of\nsnuff. He settled back to wait.\n\n_The Harn had lost Ed after he crossed the creek--it used a fallen tree\nquite a way further up for its own crossing--and did not pick him up\nagain until just before he crossed back. Now, however, he had been\nimmobile for several minutes. This looked like about as good a time as\nany to make the pickup. The Harn had a stinging unit just about\npositioned, and it had dispatched a carrier to stand by._\n\nAfter a while, sitting there, Ed began to feel uneasy. The timber was\nbig here, and open underneath, almost parklike. The nearest cover was\nfifty or sixty yards off to his left, a little tangle of brush where a\ntree had fallen and let a shaft of sunlight through.\n\nIt looked possible, but it didn't feel quite right. Still, it was about\nthe only place anything big enough to bother him could hide. The feeling\nwas getting stronger, the back hairs on Ed's neck were starting to stand\nup now. Without visible movement, or even noticing himself that he was\ndoing it, he let awareness run over his body, checking the position and\nstiffness of his legs--he had been sitting there quite a while--the\nbalance of the gun across his knees, the nearness of his thumb to the\nhammer.\n\nThoughtfully, still studying the patch of brush, he spat a thin stream\nover his left shoulder at a pile of leaves a few feet away.\n\nThinking about it later, Ed could almost have sworn the tobacco juice\nsizzled as it hit. Actually, this was probably imaginary. The stinging\nunit was not that sensitive to tobacco, though it was sensitive enough.\nAs the drops splattered it, the pile of leaves erupted with a snuffling\nhiss like an overloaded teakettle into a tornado of bucking, twisting\nactivity.\n\nEd's reflexes were not quite as fast as they had been when he was young,\nbut they were better educated. Also, he was already keyed-up. Almost as\nit started, the flurry in the leaves stopped with the roar of his rifle.\nFired like that, the heavy gun just about took his hand off, but he did\nnot notice it at the moment. He came erect in a quick scramble, jacking\nin a fresh round as he did so. The scene took on that strange timeless\naspect it often does in moments of emergency, with a man's whole being\nfocused on the fleeting _now_--you know, in an academic sort of way,\nthat things are moving fast, you are moving fast yourself, but there\nseems plenty of time to make decisions, to look things over and decide\nwhat has to be done, to move precisely, with minimum effort and maximum\neffect.\n\nWhatever the thing at his feet was, it was out of the picture now--it\nhad not even twitched after the heavy bullet tore through it. There was\na stomping rush in the little thicket he had been watching. Ed took two\nlong quick steps to one side to clear a couple of trees, threw up the\ngun and fired as something flashed across a thin spot in the brush. He\nheard the whack of the bullet in flesh and fired again. Ordinarily he\ndid not like to shoot at things he could not see clearly, but this did\nnot seem the time to be overly finicky. There was no further movement in\nthe brush.\n\nHe stood there several long moments, listening, and there was no further\nmovement anywhere. He eased the hammer down, fed in three rounds to\nreplace those he had used, and walked slowly back to the first thing he\nhad shot.\n\nAt that range, the bullet had not opened up, but it had not needed to.\nIt had practically exploded the creature anyway--the .450 has two tons\nof striking energy at the muzzle. From what was left, Ed deduced a\nsmallish, rabbit-sized thing, smooth-skinned, muscular, many-legged,\nflattish, mottled to camouflage perfectly in the leaves. There was a\nhead at one end, mostly undamaged since it had been at the end of a long\nmuscular neck, with a pair of glazing beady eyes and a surprisingly\nsmall mouth. When Ed pressed on the muscles at the base of the skull,\nthe mouth gaped roundly and a two-inch long spine slid smoothly out of\nan inconspicuous slot just below it.\n\nAt middling distances or better, Ed could still see as well as ever, but\nclose up he needed help. He got out his pocket magnifier and studied the\nspine. It looked hollow, grooved back for a distance from the point. A\ndrop of milky looking substance trembled on its tip.\n\nEd nodded thoughtfully to himself. This was what had made him uneasy, he\nwas pretty sure. What was the thing in the brush, then? Innocent\nbystander? He got stiffly to his feet, conscious now of the ache in his\nwrist that had taken most of the recoil of the first shot, the torn web\nbetween his right thumb and forefinger where the hammer spur had bitten\nin; and walked over to the thicket.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe thing in the brush was larger, quite a bit larger, and the bullets\nhad not torn it up so badly. It lay sprawled with three of its eight\nlegs doubled under it, a bear-sized animal with a gaping, cavernous,\ntoothless mouth out of all proportion to the slender body which seemed\ndesigned mainly as a frame for the muscular legs. It was not quite dead.\nAs Ed came up it struggled feebly to get up, but one of the heavy slugs\nhad evidently hit the spine, or whatever carried communications to the\nhindquarters. It fell back, shuddering convulsively, and suddenly\nregurgitated a small, furry animal.\n\nEd stepped back quickly to bring his rifle to bear, but the newest\narrival was obviously already dead.\n\nHe turned his attention back to the larger animal. It, too, was dead\nnow. There was an obvious family resemblance to the smaller one he had\nshot in the leaves. Both were smooth-skinned, many-legged, and now that\nhe looked closely he could see this one had two mouths, a small one just\nunder the nostrils, purse-lipped and tiny in its huge face but quite\nlike that of the other creature. Neither looked even remotely like\nanything he had ever seen before.\n\nHe laid down his rifle and took out his knife.\n\nTen minutes later, he knew quite a bit about the thing, but what he knew\ndid not make much sense. In the first place, its blood _was_ green, a\nyellowish pussy green. In the second place, the larger mouth, complete\nwith jaws and impressive musculature, opened not into a digestive\nsystem, but into a large closed pouch which comprised most of the\nanimal's torso. There was no proper digestive system at all, only a\nrudimentary gut, heavily laced with blood vessels, terminating at one\nend in the small second mouth, at the other in an even smaller anus.\nOtherwise, the thing had no insides except a good pair of lungs and a\nstout heart--none at all. Bone, muscle, lung, heart--plus the\nridiculously inadequate gut--that was it.\n\nWhat about the small, furry, animal then; the one the other had been\ncarrying in its pouch? There was nothing much out-of-the-way about it--a\nfeline sort of carnivore, something like a marten. The fur looked\ninteresting, and he skinned it out, casing the hide. On the left ham,\nthe skin was punctured and there was a swollen, bluish area--about the\nsort of wound that would be made by the fang of the first thing he had\nshot. Ed squatted back on his heels, studying it and putting two and two\ntogether. What two and two made was pretty hard to believe, but it\nfitted the evidence.\n\nHe wiped his knife carefully on the grass, put it back in its sheath,\nand got to his feet. Suddenly, the feeling that he was not alone\nrecurred. He looked quickly around.\n\nBack where he had shot the first thing, a man in forest-green whipcord\ntrousers and jacket was leaning over, hands on knees, looking at the\nremains. The man looked up and met Ed's eyes. He nodded casually and\nwalked over to the second thing, prodded it with his toe. After a long\nmoment he nodded again to Ed, smiled briefly, and winked out.\n\nEd stared at the empty air where the other man had been, mouth open. It\nwas just a little too much. A lot of things had happened to him in the\nlast few days, he had been able to take most of them more or less as\nthey came along, but after all, he wasn't a chicken any more, he was\npushing sixty, and there is a limit to what a man should have to put up\nwith at that age. The thought of his snug cabin, with a good fire going,\nmoosemeat bubbling in the pot, the gas lantern hissing, and the bottle\nof Hudson's Bay rum he had tucked under the eaves against just such an\noccasion as this, was suddenly very appealing.\n\nBesides, it was getting late, and he didn't think he cared to be\nstumbling around this world in the dark.\n\nHe elbowed his pack up, hooked the left shoulder strap, and headed for\nhome, staying off the trail in ordinary caution and watching his\nfooting, but moving pretty fast just the same.\n\nActually, he need not have been so careful.\n\nThe Harn had been surprised and shocked by the explosive violence of the\nman's reaction to a routine harvesting maneuver. It was a relatively\nyoung Harn, but it retained memories of its own world, where there were\nalso nasty, violent things which killed Harn. It was not pleasant to\nthink that it might have evoked some such monster in this hitherto\npeaceful place.\n\nThen, to top that, there had been the sudden appearance of the Warden.\nThe Harn, of course, saw the Warden not as a man, but in its true\naspect, which was not at all friendly.\n\nAll in all, this did not seem the moment to start any new adventures.\nThe Harn pulled in all its mobile units, including the stinger it had\nleft at the hole into the other world. It huddled protectively together\nin its nest, considering these new developments.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBy ten that evening, Ed, in conference with old Tom and the bottle of\nHudson's Bay, had done considerable hard thinking, pro and con.\n\nOf course, he didn't _have_ to go into the other world, just because the\nhole was there. He could block it off, seal it up with timbers and\nforget it.\n\nHe sat there and thought about this, absently smoothing the strange fur\non his knee. For an old-timer like himself, things weren't too hot in\nthis world. Fur didn't bring much of a price any more, and he couldn't\nget it in as he had when he was younger. His wants were simple, but\nthere was a certain rock-bottom minimum he had to have. Too, the winters\nwere starting to bother him a little, the arthritis in his hands was\ngetting worse every year, times he hardly had the strength in his left\nhand, which was the worst, to hold an ax. Another five, ten, years and\nit would be the Pioneers' Home for him--if he did not get stove up or\nsick sooner and die right here in the cabin, too helpless to cut wood\nfor the fire. He had helped bury enough others, bed and all when they\ndidn't come down the river at breakup and somebody had to go up and look\nfor them, to know it was possible.\n\nThe other world was milder, it had game and fur--good fur, too, from the\nlooks of it, something new that could lick any mutation or synthetic on\nthe market, and the income tax had still left a few fellows who could\npay through the nose to see their women look nice.\n\nAnd, the country was new. He'd never thought he'd have a crack at a new\ncountry again, a new, _good_ country. Often, he'd thought how lucky\npeople had been who were born a hundred and fifty years ago, moving into\nan easy, rich country like the Ohio or Kentucky when it was new, instead\nof the bitter North.\n\nThe Harn would be a nuisance--Ed did not think of it as the Harn, of\ncourse, but just as \"they\"--but he supposed he could find a way to clean\nthem out. A man generally could, if varmints got troublesome enough.\n\nAnd the man in forest-green whipcord, well, he _could_ have been just an\nhallucination. Ed did not really believe in hallucinations, but he had\nheard about them, and there was always a first time.\n\nEd sighed, looked at the clock, measured the bottle with his eye--still\nbetter than three quarters full.\n\nAll in all, he guessed, he'd leave the door into the other world open.\n\nHe put old Tom out and went to bed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe first order of business seemed to be to get better acquainted with\nthe Harn, and first thing in the morning he set about it. He took the\nrabbit out of the live box and tethered it in a spot in the other world\nclose to the hole, where raw earth had been exposed by a big blowdown,\nsweeping the ground afterward to clear it of tracks.\n\nGetting better acquainted with the Harn, though, did not mean he had to\nhave it come in and crawl in bed with him.\n\nBefore going to bed the night before, he had set half a can of snuff to\nsteep in some water. He loaded a bug gun with this and sprayed the\nground around the hole into the other world. From the reaction\nyesterday, he judged the stinging units did not like tobacco juice, and\nthis should discourage them from coming through.\n\nHe checked his bear snares and found three in good enough shape to\nsatisfy him--the large Harn beast, he suspected, would be about like a\ngrizzly to hold. Three would hardly be enough for a serious trapping\nprogram. Ed made his own snares from old aircraft control cable, using a\nlock of his own devising which slid smoothly and cinched down tight and\npermanently. He got out his roll of wire and box of locks and started\nmaking up some more, sitting where he could watch the rabbit he had\nstaked out.\n\nBy the middle of the afternoon the snares were done, but there had been\nno action with the rabbit, nor was there for the rest of the day.\n\nIn the morning, though, it was gone. There were three new sets of tracks\nin the bare spot--two smaller ones, either of which would have fitted\nthe stinging unit, and what looked like a carrier's. The action was\nclear enough. The small things had prowled around the rabbit for some\ntime, stopping frequently as if uncertain and suspicious. Finally, one\nhad moved in, with a little flurry of action when it met the rabbit.\nThen it had moved back and squatted again.\n\nThe big tracks came directly to the rabbit and went right out again.\nThey were heavy enough to be clear in the grass beyond the bare spot.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEd went back to the cabin and rummaged till he found a pair of\nsnakeproof pants a Stateside sport had once given him--heavy duck with\nan interlining of woven wire. They were heavy and uncomfortable to wear,\nand about as useless as wings on a pig in Alaska, where there are no\nsnakes; but they had been brand-new and expensive when given to him, and\nhe had put them away, thinking vaguely he might find a use for them some\nday. It looked like that day might be now.\n\nHe slipped them on, took his rifle and hunting pack, and set out to\nfollow the animal that had taken the rabbit.\n\nThe trail showed well in the morning dew, going straight away along the\nhillside as if the thing were headed some place definite. Ed followed\nalong for a quarter mile or so, then found himself on a fairly well\nbeaten path, which presently joined another, and then another, till it\nwas a definitely well used trail. It began to look to him like the thing\nmight have a den of some sort, and he might be getting pretty close to\nit. He left the trail and climbed up into a lone tall tree,\nfire-scorched but still struggling for life. From there, he could follow\nthe trail pretty well with his glasses for a couple of hundred yards\nbefore he lost it. Finally, he settled on a spot under an old burnt\nstump as a likely spot for the den.\n\nHe focused the glasses carefully and after a few minutes saw a flash of\nmovement there, as if something had slipped in or out. Nothing else\nhappened for about an hour. Then the grass along one of the trails began\nto wave and a large beast, similar to the one he had shot, trotted into\nsight. It slipped in under the stump and disappeared.\n\nFor the rest of the morning, nothing went in or out.\n\nThere was a very good reason for this, and Ed was it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll night and day after he shot the stinging unit and the carrier unit,\nthe Harn had stayed in its nest. By the second evening, it was getting\nhungry. It ventured out and found a few morsels, but the organized\nhunting network it ordinarily maintained had been disrupted, it had lost\ntrack of things, and the pickings were poor. Then it stumbled on the\nrabbit Ed had staked out.\n\nIts first impulse was to leave the rabbit strictly alone. In spite of\nits early promise, the other world had so far given nothing but trouble.\nOn the other hand, the rabbit was meat, and very good meat, by the smell\nand looks of it....\n\nThe Harn kept its observation unit prowling irresolutely around the\ntarget for half the night before it finally gave in to appetite and sent\nin a stinger to finish the rabbit off, a carrier to pick it up.\n\nIt was still uneasy about this when it noticed Ed near the nest the next\nmorning, confirming its fears. It promptly broke up the net it had been\nre-establishing and pulled all units back in. Maybe if it left him\nstrictly alone, he might still go on about his business, whatever that\nwas, and let the Harn get back to its harvesting.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBy noon, Ed was getting pretty stiff sitting in the tree. He climbed\ndown and eased over toward the stump, watching where he set his feet. He\nwas pretty sure the snakeproof pants would stop the stingers, but he saw\nno point in putting them to the test until he had to.\n\nAbout fifty yards away, he got a good view, and it did look like there\nmight be a sizable hole under the stump. He studied it carefully with\nthe glasses. There was a smooth-beaten mound in front, and exposed roots\nwere worn slick.\n\nAs he got closer, he noticed an unpleasant smell, and near the mouth of\nthe den he got a sudden whiff that almost gagged him--a sour, acid,\ncarrion stink like a buzzard's nest. He moved back a little. The hole\nwas wide and fairly high, two or three feet, but too dark to see back\ninto. Still, he had a sense of something stirring there not too far\nback.\n\nEd had considerable respect for caves and dens with unseen occupants--he\nhad once helped carry in the bodies of two men who had poked a stick\ninto a spring grizzly's den. At the same time, he wanted pretty badly to\nknow what was in there. He suspected there was a good deal more than\nwhat he had already seen.\n\nThe bug gun loaded with tobacco juice was in his pack, and a flashlight,\na small light one designed for a lady's purse which he always carried\nwhen away from camp. He got them out and leaned his rifle against a root\nsticking out just to the left of the den. Taking the bug gun in his left\nhand and the flashlight in his right, he stooped over to shine the light\nin, keeping as well clear of the entrance as possible.\n\nAll in all, he must have got about a five-second look, which is a lot\nlonger than it sounds when things are happening.\n\nHis first impression was a jumble--eyes, scurrying movement, and bulk.\nThen things started to shape up. About ten feet back from the entrance\nwas a huge, flattish, naked, scabrous bulk, pimpled with finger-sized\nteats. Clustered around and behind this were a tangle of slinging units,\ncarrier units, observation units. Some had their mouths fixed to teats.\n\nFor a long second or two the scene stayed frozen.\n\nThen the front edge of the bulk split and began to gape. Ed found\nhimself looking down a manhole-sized gullet into a shallow puddle of\nslime with bits of bone sticking up here and there. Toward the near end\na soggy mass of fur that might have been the rabbit seemed to be visibly\nmelting down. At the same moment, the tangle of lesser monsters sorted\nthemselves out and a wave of stingers came boiling out at him.\n\nEd dropped the flashlight, gave two mighty pumps of the bug gun, and\njumped clear of the entrance. For a moment, the den mouth boiled with\nstingers, hissing and bucking in agony. Ed sprayed them heavily again,\nsnatched up his rifle, and ran, looking back over his shoulder. The\nstingers showed no inclination to follow, though, the tobacco juice\nseemed to be keeping them well occupied for the moment.\n\nHalfway home, Ed had to stop and rest for a moment while he took a spell\nof shuddering and gagging as a sudden picture of the slimy gullet came\ninto his mind, with Ed Brown laying where the rabbit had been, melting\ndown into a stinking soup of bones and gobbets of flesh.\n\nWhen he got to the hole, his arrangement of tin cans, traps, and tobacco\njuice no longer looked nearly as secure as it had. He got his ax and cut\ntwo stout posts, framing the hole; built a stout slab door and hung it\nfrom them. Then he drove stakes close together at the threshold, to foil\nany attempts to dig under, and trimmed a sill tight to the door.\n\nHis feeling in this matter, as it happened, was sound.\n\nThe Harn was beginning to develop a pretty strong dislike for Ed Brown.\nThree of its stinging units were dead, and most of the rest were in poor\nshape, thanks to the tobacco spray. It had got a little whiff of the\nstuff itself, not enough to do any serious damage ordinarily, but right\nnow, so close to swarming time--\n\nEd was going to have to go.\n\nSo far, in this world, the Harn had needed only the three basic types of\nmobile units. There were other standard types, however, for dealing with\nmore complicated situations. As it happened, a couple of carrier embryos\nwere at just about the right stage. With a little forcing, they could be\nbrought on in not too long a time. Meanwhile, the Harn would do what it\ncould with the material available.\n\nWhen Ed came through the next day to set his snares, the Harn was\nprepared to test his snakeproof pants. They held, which was\ndisconcerting to the Harn, but it was a hard creature to convince, once\nthoroughly aroused. Ed was not too sure of how well the pants would\nstand up to persistent assault himself. After the third ambush, he took\nto spraying suspicious looking spots with tobacco juice. He shot two\nmore stingers in this way, but it slowed him up quite a bit. It took him\nall day to make four sets.\n\nIn the next three days he made a dozen sets and caught two carriers.\nThen, the fourth day, as he adjusted a snare, a seeming root suddenly\ncame to life and slashed at his hand. He was wearing gloves to keep his\nscent from the snares, and the fang caught the glove and just grazed the\nball of his left thumb. The hatchet he had been using to cut a toggle\nwas lying by his knee. He snatched it up and chopped the stinger before\nit could strike again, then yanked off the glove and looked at his hand.\nA thin scratch, beaded with drops of blood, showed on the flesh.\nUnhesitatingly, he drew the razor edge of the hatchet across it, sucked\nand spat, sucked and spat again and again. Then he started for home.\n\nHe barely made it. By the time he got to the hole, he was a very sick\nman. He latched the door, stumbled into the cabin and fell on the bed.\n\nIt was several days before he was able to be about again, his hand still\npartly paralyzed.\n\nDuring that time, the situation changed. The Harn took the offensive.\n\nEd's first notice of this was a rhythmic crashing outside the cabin. He\nmanaged to crawl to where he could see the gate he had built to block\nthe hole into the other world. It was shaking from repeated batterings\nfrom the other side. Dragging his rifle with his good hand, he scrabbled\ndown to where he could see through the chinks in the slab door. Two of\nthe carrier units were there, taking turns slamming their full weight\nagainst it. He had built that gate skookum, but not to take something\nlike that.\n\nHe noted carefully where they were hitting it, then backed off twenty\nfeet and laid the .450 across a log. He let them hit the door twice more\nto get the timing before he loosed off a shot, at the moment of impact.\nThe battering stopped abruptly, and through the chinks he could see a\nbulk piled against the gate.\n\nFor a while there was no more action. Then, after a few tentative butts\nat the door, the battering started again. This time, Ed wasn't so lucky.\nThe battering stopped when he fired, but he got an impression that the\ncarrier ran off. He thought he might have hit it, but not mortally.\n\nIn an hour or so the Harn was back, and it kept coming back. Ed began to\nworry about his ammunition, which was not unlimited. Ordinarily, two or\nthree boxes lasted him through the winter. He got his .30-06, for which\nhe had a sugar sack full of military ammunition. The light full-patch\nstuff did not have the discouraging effect of the .450, though, and he\nhad to shoot a lot oftener.\n\nAnother thing, he wasn't getting any rest, which was bad in his already\nweakened condition. Every time he dozed off the battering would start\nagain, and he would have to wake up and snap a few shots through the\ndoor. He held pretty much on one spot, not wanting to shoot the door to\npieces, but the Harn noticed this, and started hitting the door in other\nplaces.\n\nThe second day of the attack, the door came down. It had been pretty\nshaky for some time, and Ed had got the cabin ready for a siege, filling\nbutter kegs with water and nailing up the windows. As the Harn poured\nthrough, he shot several and then broke for the cabin. A carrier ran at\nhim full tilt, bent on bowling him over. Once off his feet, he would\nhave been easy meat for one of the stingers. He sidestepped, swung his\nshotgun up in one hand--he had kept it handy for the close fighting--and\nblew the carrier's spine in half. He had to kick it aside to slam the\ncabin door.\n\nFor a few minutes, then, things were pretty hectic. Ed went from one to\nanother of the loopholes he had cut, blasting first with the shotgun as\nthe Harn crowded around, then using the .30 as they grew more cautious.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter the first rush, it was obvious to the Harn that the cabin was\ngoing to be a tough nut to crack. On the other hand, there was no rush\nabout it either. Necessarily, it had let its hunting go the past several\ndays while it concentrated on Ed. It was pretty hungry, and it was in\nrich pickings now--Ed had always kept from disturbing game close to the\ncabin, partly because he liked to see it around, and partly because he\nhad an idea that some day he might be in a fix where he couldn't travel\nvery well, and would want meat close to hand. The Harn felt no such\ncompunctions. The stinging units spread through the woods, and shortly a\nsteady procession of loaded carriers began to stream back through the\nhole. Ed picked off the first few, but then the Harn found it could\nroute them up the river trail in such a way that he got only a glimpse\nas they flashed through the hole. After that he did not hit very many.\n\nEd stopped shooting. He was getting short on ammunition for the .30 now,\ntoo. He counted up. There were eighteen rounds for the .450, half a box\nof 220 grain soft point for the .30 plus about the same amount of\nmilitary stuff, and a handful of shotgun shells. Of course, there was\nstill the .30 Luger with a couple of boxes, and the .22; but they were\nnot much account for this kind of work.\n\nHe looked at the cabin door. It was stout, built of hewed three-inch\nslabs, but it wouldn't last forever against the kind of beating the gate\nhad got. Even if it did, he was going to run out of water eventually.\n\nEd thought about that for a while, sitting at the table staring at the\nlittle pile of cartridges. He was going to be run out of here sooner or\nlater, he might as well pick his own time, and now seemed about as good\nas any, while the Harn was busy exploring and hunting.\n\nHe sighed and got up to rummage around the cabin. The snakeproof pants\nhad done real good, but he did not trust them entirely. There was some\nsheet iron laid over the ceiling joists, which he had brought up to make\nnew stoves for his line camps. He got this down and cut it into small\npieces. Around the edges he drilled a number of small holes. Then he got\nout his mending gear and began sewing the plates, in an overlapping\npattern, to the legs of the snakeproof pants and to an old pair of\nmoccasins. When he finished, he was pretty well armored as far as his\ncrotch. It was an awkward outfit to move around in, but as long as he\nwas able to stay on his feet, he figured he would be reasonably secure\nfrom the stingers. As for the bigger ones, he would just have to depend\non seeing them first, and the .450.\n\nNext, he needed some gasoline. The fuel cache was under a big spruce,\nabout twenty yards from the door. He made the round of his loopholes.\nThere were no Harn in sight, they were apparently ignoring him for now.\nHe slipped out the door, closing it securely behind him, and started for\nthe cache.\n\nAs he stepped out, a stinger came from under the sill log and lashed at\nhis foot. He killed it with the ax beside the door, saving a cartridge,\nand went on, walking fairly fast but planting his feet carefully, a\nlittle awkward in his armor. He picked up a five-gallon can of gas, a\nquart of motor oil, and the twenty feet of garden hose he used for\nsiphoning gas down the bank to the boat. On the way back, another\nstinger hit him. He kicked it aside, not wanting to set down his load,\nand it came at him again and again. Just outside the door, he finally\ncaught it under a heel and methodically trampled it to death. Then he\nsnatched open the door, tossed the stuff inside, and pulled it quickly\nshut behind him.\n\nSo far, good enough.\n\nHe lashed the gas can solidly to his packboard, slipped the end of the\nhose into the flexible spout and wired it tight. Then he cut up an old\nwool undershirt and wrapped the pieces around miscellaneous junk--old\nnuts and bolts, chunks of leadline, anything to make up half a dozen\npackages of good throwing heft. He soaked these in oil and stowed them\nin a musette bag which he snapped to the D-rings of the pack.\n\nOne of the metal plates on his moccasin was hanging by a thread,\nprobably he had torn it loose in the scuffle at the door. They weren't\ngoing to take too much kicking and banging around, he could see, and\nonce he was on his way, it wouldn't be a very good idea to be caught\nbending over with his bare hands at ground level to fix them. On the\nother hand, he couldn't be using all his cartridges on the stingers,\neither, he had to save them for the carriers. He thought about this some\nwhile mending the moccasin, and decided to take the bug gun. It might\nnot kill the stingers, but it ought to discourage them enough so they\nwouldn't keep pestering him.\n\nWith his bad left arm, he had trouble getting the pack on his back. He\nfinally managed by swinging it up on the table first. It was not too\nmuch of a load, forty or fifty pounds he guessed. Still, shaky as he\nwas, it was about as much as he could manage. He had intended to just\ntry it on for size, but after he got it up he thought: well, why not\nnow? He picked up the .450, stowed the extra cartridges in his pocket,\nchecked to make sure he had matches, hung the bug gun on his belt, and\nopened the door.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was just getting dusk, but the other world was in broad daylight, the\ndays and nights were almost completely reversed again. As he stepped\nthrough the hole, the first stinger struck. He gave it a good squirt of\ntobacco juice. It went bucking and twisting off and he went on, stepping\ncarefully and solidly.\n\nLuckily, most of the Harn was foraging in the new world. Two more\nstingers ambushed him, but the tobacco juice got rid of them, and he had\nno serious trouble till he got close to the den. Two carriers came out\nand rushed him there. He shot them both and then killed the stinger that\nwas pecking at his shins. He moved quickly now, he had an idea that in\nabout a minute all hell would break loose. He swung the pack down on the\nuphill side of the den, wet the musette bag with a quick spray of gas,\ntossed it over his shoulder, jammed the free end of the hose into the\nden mouth and stabbed the can with his knife to vent it. As the gas\npoured into the den he lit one of his oil and gas soaked bombs and ran\naround in front, lighting one after another from the one in his hand and\ntossing them into the den. The musette bag caught fire and he snatched\nit from his shoulder and tossed it after the bombs. A whoof and a sheet\nof flame blew out.\n\nAbout fifty yards away there was a slender, popplelike tree. Ed had\nthought if he could make that, he would be reasonably secure while the\nHarn burned. He ran for it as hard as he could, beating at the flames\nthat had spattered on him from the burning gas, but he never made it.\n\nHarn were erupting everywhere. A carrier suddenly came charging out of\nthe brush to his left. While Ed dealt with that one, the Harn played its\nace in the hole. The two special units it had been developing to deal\nwith Ed were not quite done yet, but they were done enough to work for\nthe few minutes the Harn needed them. Ed heard a coughing grunt behind\nhim and spun around to see something new crawling out of the flame and\nsmoke at the den entrance.\n\nThis one was a roughly carrier shaped creature, but half again as large,\nbuilt for killing. It had powerful fanged jaws and its eight feet were\narmed with knifelike, disemboweling claws. As it came at Ed in a\nlumbering rush, another came crawling out after it.\n\nEd shot four times, as fast as he could work the action. The heavy slugs\ndid the job, but not quite well enough. With its dying lunge the thing\ngot to him and tossed him ten feet like a rag doll. He lit on his bad\nhand and felt the wrist bones go.\n\nAs he struggled to get up, digging his elbow in and using one hand, he\nsaw a stinger darting in at him. He had lost both the bug gun and his\nrifle when the fighting unit swiped him. He swiveled on his hips and\nkicked the stinger away. Then he saw the second fighting unit coming. He\nforgot about the stinger. It still might get to him, but, if it did, it\nwould be too late to matter.\n\nHe drew his knife, managed to get to one knee, and crouched there like\nan old gray rat, stubbly lips drawn back from worn teeth in a grin of\npain and rage. This was one he wasn't going to win, he guessed.\n\nTen feet away, the fighting unit suddenly ran down like a clockwork toy.\nIt toppled over, skidded past him under its own momentum, and lay there\nkicking spasmodically. Ed glared at it uncomprehendingly. It arched its\nneck back to almost touch its haunches, stiffened, and was still.\n\nEd looked around. The stinger was dead too, three feet from his\nshoulder, and half a dozen more which had been making for him. A cloud\nof greasy, stinking smoke was rolling out of the den. The Harn was\ndead.\n\nEd put his knife away and lay back. He did not quite pass out, but\nthings got pretty dim.\n\nAfter a while he got hold of himself and sat up. He was not too\nsurprised to see the man in forest green prodding at the bodies of the\nfighting units. The stranger looked at the smoke still oozing from the\nden and nodded approvingly. Then he came over and looked at Ed. He\nclacked his tongue in concern and bent over, touching Ed's wrist. Ed\nnoticed there was now a cast on it, and it didn't hurt so much. There\nwas also a plastic binding around his ribs and shoulder, where the claws\nof the first fighter had raked as it tossed him. That was a mighty neat\ntrick, because the rags of his shirt were still buttoned around him, and\nhe was pretty sure it had not been off at any time.\n\nThe stranger smiled at Ed, patted him on the shoulder, and disappeared.\nHe seemed to be a busy sort of fellow, Ed thought, with not much time\nfor visiting.\n\nEd felt quite a bit better now, enough better to gather up what was left\nof his gear and start home. He was glad to find old Tom waiting for him\nthere. The cat had taken to the woods when the attack on the gate first\nstarted, he didn't like shooting, and Ed had worried that the Harn might\nhave got him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEd slept till noon the next day, got up and cooked a dozen flapjacks and\na pound of bacon. After breakfast, he sat around for an hour or so\ndrinking coffee. Then he spent the rest of the afternoon puttering\naround the cabin.\n\nHe packed away the snakeproof pants, disassembled the flame-thrower,\npicked up the traps by the hole.\n\nOld Tom seemed to have pretty well cleaned up the mice under the\nlean-to. Ed took his shovel and filled in the hole he had dug for the\ncat to get at them.\n\nHe went to bed early. Tomorrow he would take a long hike around the new\nworld, scout out the fur and game, plan his trap-line and pick cabin\nsites.\n\nThe next morning, though, the hole into the other world was gone.\n\nThe posts which had marked it were sheared neatly in half. The remains\nof the door still hung there, battered and sagging; but it swung open on\nnothing but Alaska, when Ed stepped through he found himself standing\nbeside the old leaning birch.\n\nHe tried it several times before he convinced himself.\n\nHe walked slowly back toward the cabin, feeling old and uncertain, not\nquite knowing what to do with himself. Old Tom was over by the lean-to,\nsniffing and pawing tentatively at the fresh earth where Ed had filled\nin the hole. As Ed came up, he came over to rub against Ed's leg.\n\nThey went into the cabin and Ed started fixing breakfast.\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Cat and Mouse, by Ralph Williams\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CAT AND MOUSE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 24392.txt or 24392.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/3/9/24392/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Bruce Albrecht, Mary Meehan and\nthe Online Distributed Proofreading Team at\nhttp://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
