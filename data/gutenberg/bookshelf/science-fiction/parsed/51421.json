J. STECHER, JR.\n\n                        Illustrated by MARTINEZ\n\n           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n                   Galaxy Science Fiction July 1958.\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\n\n\n\n           If you were in my--well, shoes, if you don't mind\n           stretching a point--what would you do about this?\n\n\nDear Miss Dix VI:\n\nI have a problem. In spite of rumors to the contrary, my parents were\nproperly married, and were perfectly normal people at the time I was\nborn. And so was I--normal, I mean. But that all contributed to the\ncreation of my problem.\n\nI do not know if you can help me resolve it, but you have helped so\nmany others that I am willing to try you. I enjoin you not to answer\nthis letter in your column; write me privately, please.\n\nYou know all about me, of course. Who doesn't? But most of what you\nknow about me is bound to be almost entirely wrong. So I will have to\nclarify my background before I present my problem.\n\nKnow, then, that I am Alfred the Magnificent. It surprises you, I\nimagine, that I would be writing a letter to Miss Dix VI. After all, in\nspite of the tax rate, I am one of the richest--I will say it!--one of\nthe richest _men_ in the world.\n\nEvery word of that last statement is true. My parents were enormously\nwealthy, but I have accumulated even more of the world's goods than\nthey ever did. And if they had not been loaded with loot, I would not\nbe here now to be writing this letter to you.\n\nPlease excuse any lack of smoothness in the style and execution of this\nletter. I'm doing this all myself. Usually I dictate to a secretary--a\nlive secretary--but you understand that that would not be advisable for\na letter of this kind, I'm sure.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo. My background. I was born in 2352 and, having passed my infantile\nI.Q. test with flying colors, was admitted to the Harvard Creche for\nSuperior Children at the usual age of three months.\n\nThe name of Alfred Vanderform naturally had been entered on the rolls\nmuch earlier. Ten years earlier, in point of fact. My parents had been\nfortunate enough to be selected to have three children and I was to be\ntheir first. They chose to begin with a son. They had known that they\nwould be chosen, and that I would be a superior child, and had taken\nthe wise precaution of signing me up for Harvard Creche as soon as the\nplanners had finished drawing up their preliminary charts.\n\nIn spite of what you may have heard, there was absolutely no chance of\nfalsifying the initial I.Q. examination; in those days, at least. I was\na physically normal, mentally superior child. My progress at the creche\nwas entirely satisfactory. I was an ordinarily above-average genius in\nevery way.\n\nAt age six, I left the creche for my sabbatical year at home with my\nparents, and it was there that my first disaster occurred.\n\nMy mother and father moved into the same house while I was there, which\nwas the custom then (and may still be, for all I know) in order to\nprovide a proper home-like atmosphere for me. Through some carelessness\nin original planning, this was also the year that had been selected for\nthe birth of their second child, which was to be a girl. Both parents\nwere to be the same for all three of their children. Under usual\ncircumstances, they would have paid enough attention to me so that the\ndisaster would never have been allowed to take place, but plans for\ntheir second child must have made them a trifle careless.\n\nAt any rate, in spite of my early age, an embolism somehow developed\nand major damage to my heart resulted. It was here that the great\nwealth of my parents proved invaluable.\n\nPrognosis was entirely unfavorable for me. The routine procedure for\na three-offspring couple would have been to cancel the unsuccessful\nquota and reissue it for immediate production. However, it was too late\nto arrange for twins in their second quota and my parents decided to\nattempt to salvage me.\n\nAn artificial heart was prepared and substituted for the original.\nIt had a built-in atomic battery which would require renovation no\noftener than every twenty years. Voluntary control was provided through\nconnection with certain muscles in my neck, and I soon learned to\noperate it at least as efficiently as a normal heart with the normal\ninvoluntary controls.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe mechanism was considerably bigger than the natural organ, but the\nsalvage operation was a complete success. The bulge between my shoulder\nblades for the battery and the one in front of my chest for the pump\nwere not excessively unsightly. I entered the Princeton Second Stage\nCreche for Greatly Superior Children on time, being accepted without\nobjection in spite of my pseudo-deformity.\n\nIt cannot be proved that any special emolument was offered to or\naccepted by the creche managers in order to secure my acceptance. My\npersonal belief is that nobody had to cough up.\n\nThree years at Princeton passed relatively uneventfully for me. In\nspite of the best efforts and assurances of the creche psychologists,\nthere was naturally a certain lack of initial acceptance of me by\nsome of my creche mates. However, they soon became accustomed to my\nfore-and-aft bulges, and since I had greater endurance than they,\nwith voluntary control over my artificial heart, I eventually gained\nacceptance, and even a considerable measure of leadership--insofar as\nleadership by an individual is possible in a creche.\n\nShortly after the beginning of my fourth year at the Princeton Creche,\nthe second great personal disaster struck.\n\nSomehow or other--the cause has not been determined to this day--my\nartificial heart went on the blink. I did not quite die immediately,\nbut the prognosis was once again entirely unfavorable. Considerable\ndamage had somehow eventuated to my lungs, my liver and my kidneys. I\nwas a mess.\n\nBy this time, my parents had made such a huge investment in me, and my\nprogress reports had been so uniformly excellent, that in spite of all\nthe advice from the doctors, they determined to attempt salvage again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA complete repackaging job was decided upon. Blood was to be received,\naerated, purified and pumped back to the arterial system through a\nsingle mechanism which would weigh only about thirty-five pounds. Of\ncourse, this made portability an important factor. Remember that I was\nonly ten years old. I could probably have carried such a weight around\non my back, but I could never have engaged in the proper development\nof my whole body and thus could never have been accepted back again by\nPrinceton.\n\nIt was therefore determined to put the machinery into a sort of cart,\nwhich I would tow around behind me. Wheels were quickly rejected as\nbeing entirely unsatisfactory. They would excessively inhibit jumping,\nclimbing and many other boyish activities.\n\nThe manufacturers finally decided to provide the cart with a pair\nof legs. This necessitated additional machinery and added about\ntwenty-five pounds to the weight of the finished product. They solved\nthe problem of how I would handle the thing with great ingenuity by\nmaking the primary control involuntary. They provided a connection with\nmy spinal cord so that the posterior pair of legs, unless I consciously\nordered otherwise, always followed in the footsteps of the anterior\npair. If I ran, they ran. If I jumped, they jumped.\n\nIn order to make the connection to my body, the manufacturers removed\nmy coccyx and plugged in at and around the end of my spinal column. In\nother words, I had a very long and rather flexible tail, at the end of\nwhich was a smoothly streamlined flesh-colored box that followed me\naround on its own two legs.\n\nA human has certain normally atrophied muscles for control of his\nusually non-existent tail. Through surgery and training, those muscles\nbecame my voluntary controllers for my tail and the cart. That is, I\ncould go around waggin' my tail while draggin' my wagon.\n\nPardon me, Miss Dix VI. That just slipped out.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWell, the thing actually worked. You should have seen me in a high\nhurdle race--me running along and jumping over the hurdles, with that\ncontraption galloping along right behind me, clearing every hurdle I\ncleared. I kept enough slack in my tail so I wouldn't get pulled up\nshort, and then just forgot about it.\n\nGoing off a diving board was a little bit different. I learned to do\nthings like that with my back legs under voluntary control.\n\nSpeaking of diving boards, maybe you wonder how I could swim while\ntowing a trailer. No trouble at all. I would just put my tail between\nmy legs and have my cart grab me around the waist with a kind of body\nscissors. The cart's flexible air sac was on its top when it was in\nnormal position, so this held it away from my body, where it would not\nget squeezed. I would take in just enough air so that it was neutrally\nbuoyant, and with its streamlined shape, it didn't slow me down enough\nto notice.\n\nI usually \"breathed\"--or took in my air--through the intakes of the\ncart, and they stayed under water, but there was an air connection\nthrough my tail up to the lung cavity anyway, allowing me to talk. So I\njust breathed through my mouth in the old-fashioned way.\n\nBacking up was rather a problem, with my posterior legs leading the\nway, and dancing was nearly impossible until I got the idea of having\nmy trailer climb up out of the way onto my shoulders while I danced.\nThat got me by Princeton's requirements, but I must confess that I was\nnever very much in demand as a dancing partner.\n\nAt any rate, that system got me through to my sixth and last year at\nPrinceton. I sometimes believe that I may be considered to be what is\noccasionally called an \"accident-prone.\" I seem to have had more than\nmy share of tough luck. During my last year at Princeton, I got my\nthroat cut.\n\nIt was an accident, of course. No Princeton man would ever dream of\ndoing away with someone he had taken a dislike to quite so crudely. Or\nmessily.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBy voluntary control of my heart, I slowed the action down to the point\nwhere I managed to keep from bleeding to death, but my larynx was\ndestroyed beyond repair. That was when I got my Voder installation. It\nfitted neatly where my lungs used to be, and because it used the same\nresonant cavities, I soon learned to imitate my own voice well enough\nso that nobody could tell the difference, \"before\" or \"after.\"\n\nActually, it was a minor accident, but I thought I'd mention it because\nof what the news media sometimes call my \"inhuman voice.\" It even\nenables me to sing, something I never was much good at before that\naccident. Also, I could imitate a banjo and sing at the same time, a\ntalent that made me popular at picnics.\n\nThat was the last real accident I had for quite a while. I got through\nmy second (and last) home sabbatical, my Upper School, my First College\nand my Second College. I was chosen for, and got through, Advanced\nCollege with highest honors. Counting sabbaticals, that took a total of\ntwenty-nine years, plus the last of my time at Princeton. And then, an\neager youth of forty-two, I was on my own--ready to make my way in the\nworld.\n\nI was smart to avoid the government service that catches so many of us\nso-called super-geniuses. It's very satisfying work and all that, I\nsuppose, but there's no money in it, and I was rich enough to want to\nget richer.\n\nThe cart containing my organs didn't get in my way too much. With\nmy athletic days behind me, I taught it to come to heel instead of\nstriding along behind me. It was less efficient, but it was a lot less\nconspicuous. I had a second involuntary control system built in so it\nwould stay at heel without conscious thought on my part, once I put it\nthere.\n\nIn my office, I would have it curl up at my feet like a sleeping dog.\nPeople told me it was hardly noticeable--even people who didn't work\nfor me. It certainly didn't bother me or hold me back. I started to\nmake money as though I had my own printing press and managed to hang\nonto most of it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn spite of what the doom criers say, as long as there is an element\nof freedom in this country--and I think there always will be--there\nwill be ways, and I mean legal ways, of coming into large hunks of\ncash. Within ten years, I was not only Big Rich; I was one of the most\nimportant people in the world. A Policy Maker. A Power.\n\nIt was about that time that I drank the bottle of acid.\n\nNobody was trying to poison me. I wasn't trying to kill myself, either.\nNot even subconsciously. I was just thirsty. All I can say is I did a\nfirst rate job with what was left of my insides.\n\nWell, they salvaged me again, and what I ended up with was a pair of\ncarts, one trotting along beside each heel. The leash for the second\none was plugged into me in front instead of in the back, naturally, but\nwith my clothes on, nobody could tell, just by looking, that they were\nattached to me at all.\n\nThe doctors offered to get me by without the second trailer. They\nfigured they could prepare pre-digested food and introduce it into my\nbloodstream through the mechanism of my original wagon. I refused to\nlet them; I had gotten too used to eating.\n\nSo whatever I ate was ground up and pumped into my new trailer--or\nshould it be \"preceder\"? There it would be processed and the nutriments\npassed into my bloodstream as required. I couldn't overeat if I tried.\nIt was all automatic, not even hooked into my nervous system. Unusable\nproducts were compressed and neatly packaged for disposal at any\nconvenient time. In cellophane. There was, of course, interconnection\ninside of me between the two carts.\n\nI'm told I started quite a fad for walking dogs in pairs. It didn't\naffect me at all. I never got very good at voluntary control of my\nsecond trailer, but by that time my habit patterns were such that I\nhardly noticed it.\n\nOh, yes--about swimming. I still enjoyed swimming and I worked it out\nthis way: Wagon number two replaced number one in straddling me, and\nwagon number one hung onto number two. It slowed me down, but it still\nlet me swim. I quit diving. I couldn't spare the time to figure out how\nto manage it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat took care of the next five years. I kept on getting richer. I was\na happy man. Then came the crowning blow. What was left of me developed\ncancer.\n\nIt attacked my brain, among other things. And it was inoperable. It\nlooked as if I had only a couple of years before deterioration of my\nmental powers set in, and then it would be the scrap heap for me.\n\nBut I didn't give up. By that time, I had gotten used to the\nparts-replacement program. And I was very rich. So I told them to get\nbusy and build me an artificial brain as good as my own.\n\nThey didn't have time to make a neat package job this time. They\ntook over three big buildings in the center of town and filled them\nwith electronics. You should see the cable conduits connecting those\nbuildings together! Then they bought the Broadway Power Plant and used\nmost of its output. They ran in new water mains to provide the coolant.\n\nThey used most of my money, and it took all of my influence to speed\nthings up, but they got the job done in time.\n\nIt won't do you any good to ask me how they transferred my memories\nand my personality to that mass of tubes and wires and tapes and\ntransistors. I don't know. They tell me that it was the easiest part of\nthe job, and I know that they did it perfectly. My brain power and my\npersonality came through unchanged. I used them to get rich again in\nmighty short order. I had to, to pay my water and power bills.\n\nI came out of it \"Alfred the Magnificent\" and still I'm just as\nhuman as you are, even if a lot of people--a few billions of them, I\nguess--won't believe it. Granted, there isn't much of the Original Me\nleft, but there's an old saying that Glands Make the Man. Underneath it\nall, I'm the same Alfred Vanderform, the same old ordinary super-genius\nthat I have always been.\n\nI have almost finished with the background material, Miss Dix VI, and\nam nearly ready to present you my problem. I am now approaching the\nage of sixty--and have therefore reached the time of Selection for\nFatherhood. I have, in fact, been fortunate enough to be one of the few\nselected to father three children.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIf you have chanced to hear rumors that money changed hands in getting\nme selected, let me tell you that they are entirely true. The only\nthing wrong about the rumors is that none of them has named a big\nenough amount--not nearly big enough. It isn't that I don't qualify\nby any honest evaluation. I do. But there has been a good deal of\nprejudice against me as a Father, and even some skepticism about my\ncapability. But that doesn't matter; what does is that I _have_ been\nselected.\n\nWhat is more, a single superior female was chosen to be Mother of all\nthree of my children. By what is not at all a coincidence, this woman\nhappens to be my private secretary. She is, I may add, very beautiful.\n\nI am just old-fashioned enough to want my children to have all of\nthe advantages that I had myself, including parents who are fully\nmarried, in the same way that my own mother and father were. Legal\nceremony--religious service--everything!\n\nSo I have asked the chosen mother of my children-to-be to marry me, and\nGloria--that's her name--has been gracious enough to accept. We are to\nbe married week after next.\n\nNow, Miss Dix VI, we come to my problem. How can I tell if Gloria is in\nlove with me, or is just marrying me for my money?\n\nPerplexed,\n\nAlfred Vanderform\n\n(The Magnificent)\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Man in a Quandary, by L.J.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
