SHE FOUND IT ... IN A WAY...._]\n\n\nThe sun glared, fiercely detached. The thin air suddenly seemed\nfriendless, empty, a vast lake of poison and glassy water. All at once,\nthe stretching plains of sand began to waver with a terrible\ninsubstantiality before Madeleine's eyes.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nEven the Ruins of Taovahr were false. And for Madeleine, even if they\nwere not false, there was no sign of the outer garments of dream with\nwhich, on a thousand lonely nights back home on the Earth, she had\nclothed those dusty scattered skeletons of crumbled stone.\n\nDon, one of the brightest and most handsomely uniformed of all the\nbright young guide-hosts at Martian Haven, droned on to the finish of\nhis machine-tooled lecture about the Ruins of Taovahr. He, of course,\nwas the biggest chunk of falseness on Mars.\n\n\"And so folks, this is all that's left of a once great civilization. A\nfew columns and worn pieces of stone. And we can never know now how they\nlived and loved and died--for no trace whatsoever of an ancient people\nremain. The dim, dark seas of time have swept their age-old secrets into\nthe backwash of eternity--\"\n\n\"Oh God,\" whispered Madeleine.\n\n\"Shhhh!\" said her father. And her mother blinked at her with a resigned\ntolerance.\n\n\"But he's a living cliche,\" she said, trying to control the faintness,\nthe dizziness, the dullness coming back as the last illusion drained\naway. \"Even if the ruins were real, he'd make them seem trite.\"\n\n\"Madeleine!\" her mother gasped, but in a subdued way.\n\n\"But there ought to be something special about a Martian ruin, Mother.\"\n\nDon had heard her. His smile was uneasy, though politely tolerant, as\nall good hosts were to rich tourists. \"You're hard to please, Miss\nEricson. Maybe too hard.\" His lingering glance stopped just short of\ncrudity. But the look made it clear that if she wanted the romance all\nwomen were assumed to expect at Martian Haven, he could provide it, as\nhe did everything else--discreetly, efficiently and most memorably.\n\nMrs. Ericson giggled. She had long since abandoned any hope of Madeleine\nbeing, even by stretching the norm, a well-adjusted girl. But much faith\nhad been placed in a Martian vacation, and hope that it would provide\nMadeleine with some sort of emotional preoccupation, even an affair, if\nneed be--something, anything, that would at least make her seem faintly\ncapable of a normal relationship with a male. Even this fellow Don. For\nMadeleine was past thirty-five--how far past no one discussed any\nmore--and was becoming more tightly withdrawn every day.\n\nDon shouted. \"All right, folks! Now we wend our way back to Martian\nHaven, over a trail that's the oldest in the Solar System, a trail that\nwas once a mighty highway stretching from the inland city to the great\nocean that once rolled where now there is only thousands of miles of\nwind-blown sands!\"\n\nThe long line of exclaiming and sickeningly gullible tourists, either\ntoo young and wide-eyed to know better, or too old and desperate to\nadmit the phoniness, ooohhhed and ahhhhed, and the rickshaws and camels,\nplus a few hardy adventurers on foot, turned with him as Don twisted his\nown beast toward Martian Haven.\n\nEven the Ruins, she thought--they were like imported props lying in the\nsand, like old abandoned bits of a set for a TV production.\n\n\"Madeleine,\" her father said, still trying to be a big brother after\nyears of failure. \"I really don't understand this at all. Coming all the\nway to Mars, and you act like--well--like we'd just stepped around the\ncorner in Chicago to some ridiculous carnival!\"\n\n\"I am cursed,\" she whispered. \"I'm tortured.\"\n\n\"What?\" her mother said, and stared, with that child-like curiosity with\nwhich she had greeted Madeleine's advent into the world, and which she\nhad never lost.\n\n\"Tortured by the insight that both enables and compels me to see through\nthe sham and pretense.\"\n\nHer father grunted and blinked twice. He almost always blinked twice\nwhen she began sounding pedantic like that. He suspected that she did it\ndeliberately to show off his ignorance.\n\n\"Funny,\" she said, mostly to herself, \"that I allowed myself to be sold\nthis--Mars--the biggest piece of ersatz junk of all!\"\n\n\"Madeleine!\" her mother exclaimed.\n\n\"The advertisers got here first,\" Madeleine said, glancing at Don. \"The\nhucksters.\" She stopped talking. Mars offered none of itself, but the\nothers didn't understand. Mars was only what the hucksters wanted it to\nbe.\n\nShe wondered how she could hang on to the end of the season--even though\nit was only three more days. They had committed themselves to a\nrigidly-planned schedule, a clockwork program that had them and the\nother \"vacationing\" tourists jumping and squeaking like automatons:\nExotic Martian sports. Martian tennis played on a hundred-yard court\nwith the players hopping through the rarified air and lower gravity with\nan almost obscene abandon. Swimming in a strangely buoyant water,\ncalled, of course, Martian water. Sandsled racing. Air-hopping with the\nde-gravity balloons. Spectator sports, including gladiators who leaped\ninto the phony canals and fought to the death against the\nhideous-looking Martian rat-fish. There were many other \"activities\", in\nnone of which Madeleine had been able to interest herself.\n\nThis last three days promised something called the \"Martian Love Ritual\nunder the Double Moons.\" And a climactic treasure hunt among the\nsubterranean Martian labyrinths. They too, Madeleine was sure, were\nartificial.\n\nMrs. Ericson adjusted her polaroid glasses and waved her rickshaw boy\ninto his harness, where his thighs tensed for the long haul. He was an\nincredibly huge man, taller even than those specially-bred movie stars,\nwho averaged eight feet tall. Madeleine felt faint and clung to her\ncamel. The Martian camels were coughing and wheezing and the sun glared\nhorribly in the early afternoon.\n\nMr. Ericson looked with guarded apprehension at the six-legged camel.\nDon pulled him aboard. \"What a helluva beast!\" laughed Ericson. Earth\ncamels specially bred by the big travel agencies to have a so-called\n\"unearthly\" appearance. Sad creatures with two extra, dangling limbs and\na single, half-blind, blood-shot eye, watery and humbly resentful.\n\nPathetic mutation, Madeleine thought. Like those horrid rat-fish, like\nthe canals and the games and the ruins and those silly rituals. All\nersatz.\n\nThe caravan moved along the high ridge, a narrow trail that wound back\ntoward Martian Haven along the edge of the eroded cliffs.\n\n\"Maybe the only thing that would satisfy Madeleine,\" her father said,\n\"would be a real Martian.\"\n\n\"But that's not in the brochure,\" Don said.\n\n\"What's Mars without a Martian?\" giggled Mrs. Ericson.\n\nIn her own insular little world, which had been the only one Madeleine\nhad ever been able to tolerate at all, she swayed and bumped to the\ncamel's movements. \"One thing sure, Don,\" she said softly. \"There were\n_real_ Martians once. So why all the phony props? You can't tell me this\nnonsense is better than the facts about the real Martians.\"\n\n\"Ask the boys who built this place. They hired me, they make the rules,\"\nDon said. He did not look at her.\n\n\"How did you ever end up with a job like this, Don?\"\n\n\"The outfit that built the Haven hired all the old Martian colonists and\ntheir descendants, any who wanted to work for them. So I took a job.\nPay's good. It's seasonal. Anyway, I like Mars.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" she said. \"You must love it--to corrupt it like this.\"\n\n\"Mars was here, it'll still be here after the last tourist goes.\"\n\nShe laughed thinly. Don, with her, was trying to play another role, one\nhe hoped she might find interesting. \"You're a symbol of the phoniness,\nDon. Trained in the special host schools. Selected for your beautiful\nresemblance to a statue of Adonis. Artificially created to be an\never-smiling host of good-will, just like these pathetic camels have\nbeen bred for an exotic touch. No real intelligence, Don, nor\noriginality. And everything you do or say is right out of the text book\non how to make friends and influence tourists.\"\n\nDon didn't look at her. His fingers trembled on the camel's reins.\n\n\"What is this fascinating-sounding 'Ritual of Love' going to be like?\"\ngiggled Mrs. Ericson.\n\n\"It's an authentic exploitation of actual rituals once held by the\nMartians,\" Don said. \"It has a pagan religious significance. The moons\nwere male and female, and when they--ah--united their light, the\nMartians held feasts, fertility rituals--highly symbolic rites.\"\n\n\"Only symbolic?\" said Mrs. Ericson, pretending blas\u00e9 disappointment.\n\n\"Well,\" grinned Don, \"the Martians were only human. Just as--ah--well--I\nmust say that a number of tourists have a tendency to chuck their\ninhibitions during the rituals. But if not on Mars, then where?\"\n\n\"I still say,\" yelled Mr. Ericson from his camel, \"that you should\nspring a live Martian on us.\"\n\n\"We get plenty of calls for them,\" Don said. \"But so far we haven't been\nable to scare up any.\"\n\n\"What did they look like?\" asked Mrs. Ericson.\n\n\"Nobody knows. The only Martians around now are--ghosts,\" Don said, with\na strange softness. \"A few old prospectors, fakirs, beggars live in\nthese hills--hermits. They claim they see Martians, know they're here.\nThey believe in ghosts. The Martian sun drives them crazy.\"\n\n\"Like that old man we saw coming out here,\" said Mr. Ericson.\n\nDon nodded. \"They're dangerous. You must stay away from them, you\nunderstand. Or you'll get the contamination.\"\n\nFor the first time, Madeleine felt that Don was touching something real.\nShe straightened. \"Contamination?\"\n\n\"Those crazy old guys are like lepers. They stay apart from everybody\nelse. But if you go to them, you pay for it. And if you're contaminated,\nit'll cost. If you really get it, you can't be cured at all. You die.\"\n\nNo one said anything. Odd, Madeleine thought, his coming out with scare\ntalk. Didn't seem to be good propaganda. Then she got it, and laughed a\nlittle. \"Sensationalism,\" she said. \"Pure bunk.\"\n\n\"What is this contamination?\" Mr. Ericson said.\n\n\"An alien virus. Martian. Nobody's been able to isolate it. If a case\nisn't too bad we cure it in the antiseptic wards, but otherwise--well,\nyou just wither away and die in a few hours. You're all shriveled up and\nlook like a mummy.\"\n\n\"That's horrible!\" whispered Mrs. Ericson.\n\n\"They're diseased fakirs who say they can read the sands, predict your\nfuture, bring you paradise, for five credits. But stay away from them!\"\n\nAnd just at that moment, as though on cue, Madeleine thought, the old\nman stepped out about fifty feet in front of Don's camel, and blocked\nthe narrow trail.\n\n\"Caravan halt!\" Don yelled and raised his hand.\n\nNot knowing why, laughing and exclaiming, the long line of the caravan\nhalted. And Madeleine stared ahead into the old man's face. The old man\nwas dirty, bent and very ancient and hairless, with only a soiled robe\nof crude but heavy cloth hanging on his frame. There was nothing that\nseemed very much alive about him except his eyes.\n\nEven he was a stereotype, she thought. The classic old hermit character.\nThe yogi, the magi, the wise old man, the Hindu Rope Trick, look into my\ncrystal ball, I am the teller of the sands--\n\nBut her heart was pounding extraordinarily loud. His eyes--\n\nDon jumped from his camel. His hands were shaking as he raised his\nquirt. \"Out of the way!\" he shouted, then turned slightly. \"Don't come\nany nearer, folks! It'll be all right. I'll have him out of the way in a\nminute.\"\n\n\"We'll all be contaminated,\" whispered Mrs. Ericson.\n\n\"Just stay clear. You have to contact them directly to be contaminated,\"\nDon said.\n\nHe stopped five feet from the old man and raised his quirt. The old man\nlooked only at Madeleine, then shook his head slowly up and down as\nthough reaffirming some special secret. As though he shared some secret\nwith her.\n\n\"Five credits,\" the old man said, in a loud whisper. \"And I'll read the\nsands for you. The Martian sands know all your secrets and the\ntimelessness of your dreams. Let them speak to you, through me, for five\ncredits.\"\n\nDon swung the quirt savagely. It was heavy, and it thudded and smacked\nacross the old man's face and chest. He fell in the middle of the trail.\n\nThe sun wheeled crazily. Madeleine could hear her mother screaming and\nher father yelling as she moved, as though in a trance, toward the old\nman. Her feet slipped, stumbled in the shale. The old man crawled a\nlittle, got up, fell again.\n\nShe was screaming at Don to stop.\n\nThe old man had fallen to one side and the trail was clear now.\n\n\"Let him alone! Let him alone!\" Madeleine screamed. \"He's out of the\nway!\"\n\n\"Madeleine!\" Mr. Ericson shouted. \"Come back! Get away from that beggar,\nright now, or we return to Earth in the morning!\"\n\nFor the first time in her life, that she could remember, her father's\nthreats meant nothing. But the old fear was there as she moved toward\nthe Martian hermit, on a painful tightwire of impulse between threat and\ndesire. She had learned that for any real feeling--fear, joy, pain or\neven the dimmest-remembered pleasure, you paid a dear price. But she\nmoved on.\n\nThe old man's face was bleeding. She saw the long welts of red on the\nflesh, and the blood-flecks and tortured little broken channels of blood\ncrossing it. Sound roared around her as she eluded Don's hands and knelt\ndown, took the old man's head in her arms. She tilted her canteen to his\nlips.\n\nThere was a kind of strange triumph in the old man's eyes as he\npeered past her for only a moment and looked at Don. And from\nsomewhere--Madeleine couldn't even tell whether it was real--came a\nthought.\n\n\"_Madeleine--come back. Come back when you can. And you will find joy._\"\n\nLater she knew how she kicked and screamed at them as they dragged her\naway. How Mrs. Ericson was embarrassed by the display, and how her\nfather refused to touch her because of the fear of contamination. And\nher mother weeping, later, because of the disgrace and because of what\nthe other guests would think.\n\nIn the shiny antiseptic ward at Martian Haven, the virus was burned out\nby a certain number of roentgens of carefully proportioned X-rays, gamma\nrays and neutron bombardment. She kept thinking of the old man's eyes,\nof the stray thought that promised joy.\n\nShe kept seeing the old man lying off the trail among the rocks, how he\nhad raised himself on his elbow, and how he waggled the blood-clot of\nhis head in the glaring sun as they dragged Madeleine away.\n\nOccasionally she thought of the whole project--in Mars, Mecca of Earth\ntourists, Martian Haven, Dream City of the Solar System--that was so\ncolorful and impressive and exotic to others, and she wondered if it was\nall really as ridiculous as it seemed to her.\n\nShe lay there in the dark of the room as evening reached over the dead\nsea bottom toward the edifice that was Martian Haven. Out there in the\nbig amphitheatre, resurrected supposedly from old Martian ruins, Martian\nHaven, with all of its rich, efficient facilities and staff, was\npreparing the stage, props and guests for the Love Ritual of the Double\nMoons.\n\nThe core and centerpiece of Martian Haven was a great cubistic hotel,\nwith the two Martian canals on two sides, renovated, of course, and a\nfive-mile-long artificial lake on a third side. It was somehow designed,\nin the middle of all that vast emptiness of dead sea, sand and eroded\nrock, to have a not-ungraceful look of insubstantiality, as though at\nany moment it might open great wings of some sort and take off into the\nMartian nowhere by which it was so overwhelmingly surrounded. The side\nthat faced the lake curved in a half-moon, so that it commanded a wide\nprospect to the eroded hills that had once been mountains to the west\nand to the east thousands of unbroken miles of desert, that had once,\nthey said, been an ocean.\n\nWhen Madeleine opened her eyes, it was night. On many a starry night she\nhad lain inside walls not so different from these, and felt much the\nsame, she thought, surrounded by a desert of her own. Away off there in\nthe blackness, Earth shone palely--and she might as well never have left\nit at all.\n\nAnd then again she saw the old hermit's eyes out there in the dark, his\nburning eyes where there should be only sterile emptiness in the night.\nAnd his voice calling where there would otherwise have been only the\ndusty echoes of an arid past.\n\nOutside now the tourists were gathering in the double moonlight. The\nweird extrapolation of Earth music that was supposed to be the strains\nof Martian rhythms drifted to her, and lights flickered from burning\ntapers where dancers undulated and writhed fitfully. A libidinous\nexpectancy was as heavy as a thick scent in the night.\n\nThen, only for a moment, she despised herself for not being with the\nothers, for never having been able to participate in the futile\nmake-believe. She felt like a child who had never grown beyond the stage\nof the most old-fashioned fairy tales. Someone who had gone beyond the\nlooking-glass and had never been able to get back, but who had never\nquite been able to forget the world from which she had come.\n\nShe could hear her parents and Don talking in the next room.\n\n\"It's a shame for her to miss the ritual of the double moons,\" Don said.\n\n\"She's always been that way,\" Mr. Ericson said. \"Staying by herself.\"\n\n\"We've tried everything,\" said Mrs. Ericson.\n\n\"She's spent half her life on an analyst's couch,\" said Mr. Ericson.\n\n\"She wouldn't even,\" Mrs. Ericson said, \"fall in love with her\n_analyst_!\"\n\n\"She was only in love once,\" said Mr. Ericson, \"and that had to be with\nan idiot who was always writing sonnets.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"A poet,\" said Don. \"There used to be a lot of poets.\"\n\n\"But not in my life,\" said Mr. Ericson.\n\n\"Maybe,\" Don said, \"your daughter expected a little bit too much from\nMars.\"\n\n\"Don,\" Mrs. Ericson pleaded, \"maybe _you_ can do something.\"\n\n\"I'll be glad to try,\" Don said.\n\nSo Madeleine lay there and waited for Don, the perfect host, who could\nsupply everyone at Martian Haven with whatever was necessary to insure a\npleasant day.\n\nLater, though she did not turn or make any sign of noticing, she knew he\nhad entered the room and was standing over her. She could see the\nperiphery of his giant shadow projected by moonlight over the colored\nglass.\n\n\"Madeleine--we've got a date for the ritual tonight.\"\n\n\"That's odd, Don. I don't remember it.\"\n\n\"But you didn't say you _wouldn't_ attend it with me, when I suggested\nit this morning.\"\n\n\"Well, Don, this is an official rejection of your proposal.\"\n\nShe saw his shadow bend, his body drop down beside the couch. She felt\nhis hands on her arm. The peculiar fright went through her.\n\n\"You won't listen, Madeleine, but whatever you're looking for\nhere--please forget it! The rituals will help you forget. Try it,\nMadeleine! Please--\"\n\nWhy did he, all at once, sound so desperate?\n\n\"With you?\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"You're just an artificial dream, Don, that comes true seasonally for\npeople so sick that they can convince themselves you're real--for a\nprice.\"\n\n\"Well, Madeleine--are you so different?\"\n\n\"I guess I am.\"\n\n\"You just want the impossible. The others--they want little dreams we\ncan give them easily.\"\n\nThere was a strain, a tension in him, in his hands, in his voice.\nSuddenly, his hands held her, and his face was close above her lips.\n\"You're still young and beautiful to me,\" he whispered.\n\nShe turned her face away, and gazed at the tattered and splendid veils\nof moonlight as Deimos and Phobos neared one another, with undying\neagerness to consummate the timeless ritual.\n\nDimly, she could hear the communal voices rising to desire.\n\n\n    \"_Twin Moons, Love Moons, whirling bright,\n    Bring me Martian love tonight!_\"\n\n\nIf you could expect too much from Mars, then where could one find the\nanswer to the intangible wish? Sirius. Far Centauris. And at the end of\nit, the hucksters, the phony props, would be there first.\n\nSome people should stay on Earth, she thought, those who are so hard to\nplease. There the veils of space and time might keep the last illusions\nliving. Once you find that even the farthest star is illusory, there's\nno place left to go.\n\nHis lips were near her lips. His voice was low. \"You are different!\" His\nthroat trembled. \"You really are. But--I wonder if you're different\nenough.\"\n\nShe was aware of the awful gnawing emptiness within her that was only\nintense desire too frightened to be free. And then his lips were\ncrushing to hers and she allowed it, for she knew what was to be her\nonly way out, and the promise of union was a haze in the room like the\nveils of light from the moons of Mars that joined against the starlight\nof heaven.\n\nThere was more than the ardent in his intensity. A kind of desperation,\nhis desire to please going beyond the line of duty. The old consuming\nterror returned.\n\nShe pushed him away. His hands reached, his body crushed. Panic. She\nfelt unable to breathe, and she started to scream. His hand was over her\nmouth.\n\n\"Don't look any deeper, don't probe any farther!\" he said, like a\nsuddenly terrible threat. \"I beg you, don't do it! You're\ndifferent--beautifully different, Madeleine. But not different enough!\nNone of them ever are!\"\n\nShe squirmed away, onto the floor between the glass and the couch, and\nscurried toward the door. She could hear the gasping, the sobbing\ndesperation in his voice, and his shadow lengthened across the walls.\n\nThen, as she hesitated in the doorway, he was gone.\n\nShe put on a nylon hiking suit and left the room. The silence of the\nhall was not real, and the emptiness was not really emptiness. It was\nlike waking and being exasperatingly aware of only the fleeting end of a\ndream. And as she slipped out a side entrance, even the wailing of\nexotic musical instruments seemed in a sense not real. Even the silence,\nthe feeling of being followed, watched, even that seemed artificial--it\nwas impossible to substantiate the suspicion.\n\nHer palms were wet as she slipped along the wall toward the garage where\nthe sandsleds were kept. From the amphitheatre she could hear the\nrituals, the intercessions, comminations, hymns, libations,\nincense-burning, and who knew what else. She saw the reflection of\nchrome and artificial glitter disguised as Martian authenticity, the\nlights hanging like a grove of pastel moons, and the shrill empty\nlaughter of girls uncoiling as bright as tinsel through the sluggish\nMartian evening. And in spite of the sound and elaborate pretension, it\nall had the undying feel of lugubrious solitude.\n\nIt had, for a doomed generation driven into inescapable conformity, the\nnecessary quality of a dream in which a stubborn unconsciousness seeks\never for truth. And later, back on Earth, in the rut and groove, it\nwould remain only a dream no one ever talked about to anyone else. After\nall, it would simply be something that happened on another world.\n\nShe gave one brief, bitter laugh. And even on another world the last\ndesperate dream was false.\n\nThere might be something to be said for release through a pagan orgy\nunder the double moons; she had no moral scruples about it. But the\npaganism would have to be real, that was the thing. Besides, it was too\nlate. For a moment she pressed her flattened hands against her face and\nfelt tears squeezing through the tightly-locked fingers. She felt as\nthough she might explode somewhere inside and realized how the invisible\nedges of living had cut her soul to pieces.\n\nIt wasn't even self-pity any more. It had grown above self-pity to a\nrealism beyond tragedy.\n\nShe felt icy and empty and alone as she lit a cigarette. Through the\ntaper smoke, the glowing amphitheatre seemed like a golden porpoise\nlapped in dawn, and coupled with the expanse of the Haven it nestled in\nthe night to resemble a sleeping question mark, an entity gay and sad\nand full of what was called life.\n\nThere was no turning back now. There was no turning back, even to Earth,\nfor that would be the most humiliating defeat of all.\n\nThen she was inside the first sandsled. The sled moved noiselessly out\nof the garage and whispered away over the sands.\n\nAfter only a few minutes the radio frightened her with an abrupt voice\nlike that of a disembodied spirit.\n\n\"Madeleine!\"\n\nShe looked back through the trailing skeins of moonlight. A dark spot\nwas overtaking her. She couldn't go any faster. Evidently Don had one of\nthose racing sleds that hardly seemed to touch the sand at all.\n\n\"Madeleine! Please--for God's sake, don't see that old hermit!\"\n\n\"For the sake of which God, Don? I understand the Martians had more than\none.\"\n\n\"Madeleine! I'm begging you to come back!\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"You know why.\"\n\n\"The contamination!\" She laughed. \"Your melodramatic devices don't\nfrighten me.\"\n\n\"It's true. You'll die--! Come back!\"\n\n\"To what?\"\n\n\"We'll talk about it! Just come back!\"\n\n\"What's so dangerous, Don, about my not accepting things here as they're\nsupposed to be?\"\n\nHis voice tightened. \"Just stop, stop and come back!\"\n\nShe didn't stop, didn't bother to answer. She circled the sandsled among\nthe hills, skirting the rocky clefts with a reckless abandon she had\nnever felt before, and her face was flushed as she leaned her head back\nand laughed.\n\n\"Madeleine!\"\n\nIt was the last time he called to her. After that, the silence conveyed\nan intensity of purpose far stronger than verbal entreaties.\n\nShe swerved the sandsled dangerously among the erosions, and felt the\ngrinding strain at the base of her skull as the sled bounded from one\nspire and careened toward another, which she barely avoided smashing\ninto head-on.\n\nShe recognized the area. She leaped out of the car and ran, hearing the\npursuing sandsled stop somewhere below her as she climbed.\n\nFor an instant dizziness threatened, and the surroundings and the\nmotions of Don and herself and the love moons in the sky seemed wildly,\nalmost dangerously abstracted, as if viewed through drug-glazed eyes. A\npanicky wash of blood came to her face and she struggled for breath,\nwanting to cry out. It passed. Her mind groped for reason and the terror\nreceded.\n\nShe went on up to the ridge and found the old man waiting. From that\nhigh ridge where the night wind cut coldly toward the Martian south, the\nlights of the rituals in the amphitheatre of Martian Haven flickered in\na misty halo far away, like phosphorescent globes of spooky glowing, and\nfrenetic dancings and shiftings of crazed flames.\n\nThe old man had a vague, insubstantial look, only his eyes seemed real,\nalmost too real, in their intensity as he looked at her. He was propped\nagainst a block of eroded rock and the wind rustled the fringes of his\nragged robe.\n\nShe sat beside him, their shoulders touched. And then, as though slowly\ndissolving through some chemical reaction, the old man began to fade.\nVaguely Don was there, too, in a nebulous transparency like the old man.\nAnd Madeleine lay there, her face pressed into the sand. On Mars one\nshould expect, without shock, a different kind of reality.\n\nTheir voices weren't really voices. Just thoughts, thoughts in the head,\nfeelings, but nothing solid. The thoughts of Don and the old man seemed\nto be in some kind of time-worn conflict.\n\n\"You encouraged her,\" Don was thinking.\n\n\"Those who can see a little should be urged to try to see more. Maybe,\nsometime, we'll find one who is different enough to come through to us.\"\n\n\"No! It never works that way! They just--die.\"\n\n\"Maybe they won't--always,\" the old man thought.\n\nMadeleine felt strangely disoriented, as though dreaming with delirious\nfever. All time and space seemed for a moment to be enclosed within that\nrocky space, itself unmoored and unhelmed upon a dark and compassless\nocean.\n\nMartians, Martians all around, but not a one to see. Like disembodied\nspirits, they had long ago evolved beyond confinement to fleshly bodies.\nBut Earth people suspected there was something, so the younger ones,\nlike Don, allowed suspicion to take any stereotyped, acceptable form.\nBut the oldsters believed in being honest. Let those who can see--see.\n\n\"Madeleine!\" Don was thinking, desperately, as desperate as only pure\nfeeling can be. \"Go back--back to the Haven. You can still go back!\"\n\n\"But she cannot,\" the old man said. \"For those who come this far,\nthere's never anything to go back to.\"\n\n\"No--I cannot,\" Madeleine thought. \"I don't want to go back.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Don thought after a while. \"All right, Madeleine.\"\n\nThen she was on her feet and moving over sand and stone that seemed\nalive toward the Ruins of Taovahr--but they were no longer ruins. She\nheard the murmur of sea-tides and warmer winds sighing over a younger\nland.\n\nThe sterile sand blossomed. Aridity drifted away. \"_Don! Is that you,\nDon?_\"\n\nDon seemed to be somewhere, felt rather than heard, sensed, not seen.\nAnd instead of ruins, the high white walls and rising towers surrounded\nby gardens, fountains, and through the gardens a stream of clear water,\nsoft with the pads of giant water lilies, trailing like glass under the\nmoonlight and sympathetic shadows of leaves.\n\n\"Don! You knew what real living was in your youth. It was way, way back\nin time. Didn't you? And only if you're really living do you know where\nyou're going, and you knew, didn't you? You gave up the machines, and\nwent on to freedom. You escaped the confining flesh that can be caught\nup in war, and in hopeless peonage to the radios and teevee and radar\nand thundering jets that drown out the song of real life, and a horde of\ncunningly made, treacherous machines--\"\n\n\"Madeleine. Join us--the way we are now. You can do it--\"\n\n\"I--I can't see you, Don.\"\n\n\"You don't have to. You just think about it and join us, all of us--\"\n\n\"Just--just a spirit of some kind, Don--is that it?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes--something like that! You can't explain it! Just do it!\"\n\nIt was too late, she knew that now. \"We're old, too old, where I come\nfrom, Don. When I was very young, I might have done it.\" Only the\nwonder-filled child can go through the looking glass and--stay.\n\nAnd he knew she was right, that she was too old. But the old man had\npromised her a moment of joy. She suddenly saw him--Don--the bright,\nstrong man waiting across the stream. \"It's what you brought to me,\" he\nsaid softly. \"When we were young we looked this way--and we were real.\"\n\nShe moved toward the water and her arms lifted to him. At first she\ncouldn't recognize the woman who bathed there. From the water's surface\na slight vapor drifted, and she saw the wet gleam of naked arms as they\nlowered and raised and the water shone on the pale loveliness of\nunashamed nakedness. And then she knew that the woman there, her hair\nfloating over the water, was Madeleine. She whispered her own name.\n\nHe took her in his arms, and she could hear her breath joining his as\nthe mist drifted up among the buttressed writhings of the trees. She was\nlaughing, her breasts pressed to the damp richness of the loam, and in\nthe water she could see her face, white, with sharp shadows under the\neyes and a high look of joy.\n\n\"I love you, Madeleine.\"\n\nHis face was above her and his lips crushed to hers, and she could hear\nthe stream flowing all around her like blood in her ears.\n\n\"I love you, Madeleine.\"\n\nA whisper went through the gray starlight that Mars was turning toward\nmorning. And the waters of the mind drained away, leaving high and clear\nthe common desire that stands like a drowned tower.\n\n\"I love you, Madeleine.\"\n\nShe could hear it all fading away--her own joy, the fires--as if\neverything were melting, a wax candle dying, a wine glass draining, a\nsoft light dimming....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey had found her by following the pathway left by bits of abandoned\nclothing. There was nothing but the rescue party and thousands of miles\nof waste around Madeleine where she lay in the ancient, dried-up creek\nbed. And she was shriveled and dried out and resembled, as Don had\npredicted, a mummy. But there was a kind of softness of repose on her\nface that hadn't been there before. Don stood back and looked down at\nher and thought about the waste.\n\nMr. Ericson ran forward in his purple shirt and fell to his knees\nwhispering, \"Madeleine, we've found you! Madeleine--Madeleine--can't you\nhear your Daddy?\"\n\n\"We give you anything you want,\" Don whispered, but no one heard him.\n\nAnd while Mr. Ericson wept, Mrs. Ericson slumped into Don's arms as\nthough it was the end of the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Mating of the Moons, by Kenneth O'Hara\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MATING OF THE MOONS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 40969-8.txt or 40969-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/4/0/9/6/40969/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
