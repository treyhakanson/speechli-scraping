His glance shifted along the long stone-walled, torchlit\nroom to the file of mail-clad soldiers who stood like steel statues by\nits door. A word from him and two of them sprang forward.\n\n\"You may bring in the prisoner,\" he said.\n\nThe two disappeared through the door, and in moments there came a clang\nof opening bolts and grating of heavy hinges from somewhere in the\nbuilding. Then the clang of the returning soldiers, and they entered the\nroom with another man between them whose hands were fettered.\n\n[Illustration: Illustrated by MOREY]\n\nHe was a straight figure, and was dressed in drab tunic and hose. His\ndark hair was long and straight, and his face held a dreaming strength,\naltogether different from the battered visages of the soldiers or the\nchangeless mask of the Inquisitor. The latter regarded the prisoner for\na moment, and then lifted one of the parchments from before him and read\nfrom it in a smooth, clear voice.\n\n\"Henri Lothiere, apothecary's assistant of Paris,\" he read, \"is charged\nin this year of our lord one thousand four hundred and forty-four with\noffending against God and the king by committing the crime of sorcery.\"\n\nThe prisoner spoke for the first time, his voice low but steady. \"I am\nno sorcerer, sire.\"\n\nJean de Marselait read calmly on from the parchment. \"It is stated by\nmany witnesses that for long that part of Paris, called Nanley by some,\nhas been troubled by works of the devil. Ever and anon great claps of\nthunder have been heard issuing from an open field there without visible\ncause. They were evidently caused by a sorcerer of power since even\nexorcists could not halt them.\n\n\"It is attested by many that the accused, Henri Lothiere, did in spite\nof the known diabolical nature of the thing, spend much time at the\nfield in question. It is also attested that the said Henri Lothiere did\nstate that in his opinion the thunderclaps were not of diabolical\norigin, and that if they were studied, their cause might be discovered.\n\n\"It being suspected from this that Henri Lothiere was himself the\nsorcerer causing the thunderclaps, he was watched and on the third day\nof June was seen to go in the early morning to the unholy spot with\ncertain instruments. There he was observed going through strange and\ndiabolical conjurations, when there came suddenly another thunderclap\nand the said Henri Lothiere did vanish entirely from view in that\nmoment. This fact is attested beyond all doubt.\n\n\"The news spreading, many hundreds watched around the field during that\nday. Upon that night before midnight, another thunderclap was heard and\nthe said Henri Lothiere was seen by these hundreds to appear at the\nfield's center as swiftly and as strangely as he had vanished. The\nfear-stricken hundreds around the field heard him tell them how, by\ndiabolical power, he had gone for hundreds of years into the future, a\nthing surely possible only to the devil and his minions, and heard him\ntell other blasphemies before they seized him and brought him to the\nInquisitor of the King, praying that he be burned and his work of\nsorcery thus halted.\n\n\"Therefore, Henri Lothiere, since you were seen to vanish and to\nreappear as only the servants of the evil one might do, and were heard\nby many to utter the blasphemies mentioned, I must adjudge you a\nsorcerer with the penalty of death by fire. If anything there be that\nyou can advance in palliation of your black offense, however, you may\nnow do so before final sentence is passed upon you.\"\n\nJean de Marselait laid down the parchment, and raised his eyes to the\nprisoner. The latter looked round him quickly for a moment, a\nhalf-glimpsed panic for an instant in his eyes, then seemed to steady.\n\n\"Sire, I cannot change the sentence you will pass upon me,\" he said\nquietly, \"yet do I wish well to relate once, what happened to me and\nwhat I saw. Is it permitted me to tell that from first to last?\"\n\nThe Inquisitor's head bent, and Henri Lothiere spoke, his voice gaining\nin strength and fervor as he continued.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Sire, I, Henri Lothiere, am no sorcerer but a simple apothecary's\nassistant. It was always my nature, from earliest youth, to desire to\ndelve into matters unknown to men; the secrets of the earth and sea and\nsky, the knowledge hidden from us. I knew well that this was wicked,\nthat the Church teaches all we need to know and that heaven frowns when\nwe pry into its mysteries, but so strong was my desire to know, that\nmany times I concerned myself with matters forbidden.\n\n\"I had sought to know the nature of the lightning, and the manner of\nflight of the birds, and the way in which fishes are able to live\nbeneath the waters, and the mystery of the stars. So when these\nthunderclaps began to be heard in the part of Paris in which I lived, I\ndid not fear them so much as my neighbors. I was eager to learn only\nwhat was causing them, for it seemed to me that their cause might be\nlearned.\n\n\"So I began to go to that field from which they issued, to study them. I\nwaited in it and twice I heard the great thunderclaps myself. I thought\nthey came from near the field's center, and I studied that place. But I\ncould see nothing there that was causing them. I dug in the ground, I\nlooked up for hours into the sky, but there was nothing. And still, at\nintervals, the thunderclaps sounded.\n\n\"I still kept going to the field, though I knew that many of my\nneighbors whispered that I was engaged in sorcery. Upon that morning of\nthe third day of June, it had occurred to me to take certain\ninstruments, such as loadstones, to the field, to see whether anything\nmight be learned with them. I went, a few superstitious ones following\nme at a distance. I reached the field's center, and started the\nexaminations I had planned. Then came suddenly another thunderclap and\nwith it I passed from the sight of those who had followed and were\nwatching, vanished from view.\n\n\"Sire, I cannot well describe what happened in that moment. I heard the\nthunderclap come as though from all the air around me, stunning my ears\nwith its terrible burst of sound. And at the same moment that I heard\nit, I was buffeted as though by awful winds and seemed falling downward\nthrough terrific depths. Then through the hellish uproar, I felt myself\nbumping upon a hard surface, and the sounds quickly ceased from about\nme.\n\n\"I had involuntarily closed my eyes at the great thunderclap, but now,\nslowly, I opened them. I looked around me, first in stupefaction, and\nthen in growing amazement. For I was not in that familiar field at all,\nsire, that I had been in a moment before. I was in a room, lying upon\nits floor, and it was such a room as I had never seen before.\n\n\"Its walls were smooth and white and gleaming. There were windows in the\nwalls, and they were closed with sheets of glass so smooth and clear\nthat one seemed looking through a clear opening rather than through\nglass. The floor was of stone, smooth and seamless as though carven from\none great rock, yet seeming not, in some way, to be stone at all. There\nwas a great circle of smooth metal inset in it, and it was on it that I\nwas lying.\n\n\"All around the room were many great things the like of which I had\nnever seen. Some seemed of black metal, seemed contrivances or machines\nof some sort. Black cords of wire connected them to each other and from\npart of them came a humming sound that did not stop. Others had glass\ntubes fixed on the front of them, and there were square black plates on\nwhich were many shining little handles and buttons.\n\n\"There was a sound of voices, and I turned to find that two men were\nbending over me. They were men like myself, yet they were at the same\ntime like no men I had ever met! One was white-bearded and the other\nplump and bare of face. Neither of them wore cloak or tunic or hose.\nInstead they wore loose and straight-hanging garments of cloth.\n\n\"They were both greatly excited, it seemed, and were talking to each\nother as they bent over me. I caught a word or two of their speech in a\nmoment, and found it was French they were talking. But it was not the\nFrench I knew, being so strange and with so many new words as to be\nalmost a different language. I could understand the drift, though, of\nwhat they were saying.\n\n\"'We have succeeded!' the plump one was shouting excitedly. 'We've\nbrought someone through at last!'\n\n\"'They will never believe it,' the other replied. 'They'll say it was\nfaked.'\n\n\"'Nonsense!' cried the first. 'We can do it again, Rastin; we can show\nthem before their own eyes!'\n\n\"They bent toward me, seeing me staring at them.\n\n\"'Where are you from?' shouted the plump-faced one. 'What time--what\nyear--what century?'\n\n\"'He doesn't understand, Thicourt,' muttered the white-bearded one.\n'What year is this now, my friend?' he asked me.\n\n\"I found voice to answer. 'Surely, sirs, whoever you be, you know that\nthis is the year fourteen hundred and forty-four,' I said.\n\n\"That set them off again into a babble of excited talk, of which I could\nmake out only a word here and there. They lifted me up, seeing how sick\nand weak I felt, and seated me in a strange, but very comfortable chair.\nI felt dazed. The two were still talking excitedly, but finally the\nwhite-bearded one, Rastin, turned to me. He spoke to me, very slowly, so\nthat I understood him clearly, and he asked me my name. I told him.\n\n\"'Henri Lothiere,' he repeated. 'Well, Henri, you must try to\nunderstand. You are not now in the year 1444. You are five hundred years\nin the future, or what would seem to you the future. This is the year\n1944.'\n\n\"'And Rastin and I have jerked you out of your own time across five\nsolid centuries,' said the other, grinning.\n\n\"I looked from one to the other. 'Messieurs,' I pleaded, and Rastin\nshook his head.\n\n\"'He does not believe,' he said to the other. Then to me, 'Where were\nyou just before you found yourself here, Henri?' he asked.\n\n\"'In a field at the outskirts of Paris,' I said.\n\n\"'Well, look from that window and see if you still believe yourself in\nyour 15th-century Paris.'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I went to the window. I looked out. Mother of God, what a sight before\nmy eyes! The familiar gray little houses, the open fields behind them,\nthe saunterers in the dirt streets--all these were gone and it was a new\nand terrible city that lay about me! Its broad streets were of stone and\ngreat buildings of many levels rose on either side of them. Great\nnumbers of people, dressed like the two beside me, moved in the streets\nand also strange vehicles or carriages, undrawn by horse or ox, that\nrushed to and fro at undreamed-of speed! I staggered back to the chair.\n\n\"'You believe now, Henri?' asked the whitebeard, Rastin, kindly enough,\nand I nodded weakly. My brain was whirling.\n\n\"He pointed to the circle of metal on the floor and the machines around\nthe room. 'Those are what we used to jerk you from your own time to this\none,' he said.\n\n\"'But how, sirs?' I asked. 'For the love of God, how is it that you can\ntake me from one time to another? Have ye become gods or devils?'\n\n\"'Neither the one nor the other, Henri,' he answered. 'We are simply\nscientists, physicists--men who want to know as much as man can know and\nwho spend our lives in seeking knowledge.'\n\n\"I felt my confidence returning. These were men such as I had dreamed\nmight some day be. 'But what can you do with time?' I asked. 'Is not\ntime a thing unalterable, unchanging?'\n\n\"Both shook their heads. 'No, Henri, it is not. But lately have our men\nof science found that out.'\n\n\"They went on to tell me of things that I could not understand. It\nseemed they were telling that their men of knowledge had found time to\nbe a mere measurement, or dimension, just as length or breadth or\nthickness. They mentioned names with reverence that I had never\nheard--Einstein and De Sitter and Lorentz. I was in a maze at their\nwords.\n\n\"They said that just as men use force to move or rotate matter from one\npoint along the three known measurements to another, so might matter be\nrotated from one point in time, the fourth measurement, to another, if\nthe right force were used. They said that their machines produced that\nforce and applied it to the metal circle from five hundred years before\nto this time of theirs.\n\n\"They had tried it many times, they said, but nothing had been on the\nspot at that time and they had rotated nothing but the air above it from\nthe one time to the other, and the reverse. I told them of the\nthunderclaps that had been heard at the spot in the field and that had\nmade me curious. They said that they had been caused by the changing of\nthe air above the spot from the one time to the other in their trials. I\ncould not understand these things.\n\n\"They said then that I had happened to be on the spot when they had\nagain turned on their force and so had been rotated out of my own time\ninto theirs. They said that they had always hoped to get someone living\nfrom a distant time in that way, since such a man would be a proof to\nall the other men of knowledge of what they had been able to do.\n\n\"I could not comprehend, and they saw and told me not to fear. I was not\nfearful, but excited at the things that I saw around me. I asked of\nthose things and Rastin and Thicourt laughed and explained some of them\nto me as best they could. Much they said that I did not understand but\nmy eyes saw marvels in that room of which I had never dreamed.\n\n\"They showed me a thing like a small glass bottle with wires inside, and\nthen told me to touch a button beneath it. I did so and the bottle shone\nwith a brilliant light exceeding that of scores of candles. I shrank\nback, but they laughed, and when Rastin touched the button again, the\nlight in the glass thing vanished. I saw that there were many of these\nthings in the ceiling.\n\n\"They showed me also a rounded black object of metal with a wheel at the\nend. A belt ran around the wheel and around smaller wheels connected to\nmany machines. They touched a lever on this object and a sound of\nhumming came from it and the wheel turned very fast, turning all the\nmachines with the belt. It turned faster than any man could ever have\nturned it, yet when they touched the lever again, its turning ceased.\nThey said that it was the power of the lightning in the skies that they\nused to make the light and to turn that wheel!\n\n\"My brain reeled at the wonders that they showed. One took an instrument\nfrom the table that he held to his face, saying that he would summon the\nother scientists or men of knowledge to see their experiment that night.\nHe spoke into the instrument as though to different men, and let me hear\nvoices from it answering him! They said that the men who answered were\nleagues separated from him!\n\n\"I could not believe--and yet somehow I did believe! I was half-dazed\nwith wonder and yet excited too. The white-bearded man, Rastin, saw\nthat, and encouraged me. Then they brought a small box with an opening\nand placed a black disk on the box, and set it turning in some way. A\nwoman's voice came from the opening of the box, singing. I shuddered\nwhen they told me that the woman was one who had died years before.\nCould the dead speak thus?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"How can I describe what I saw there? Another box or cabinet there was,\nwith an opening also. I thought it was like that from which I had heard\nthe dead woman singing, but they said it was different. They touched\nbuttons on it and a voice came from it speaking in a tongue I knew not.\nThey said that the man was speaking thousands of leagues from us, in a\nstrange land across the uncrossed western ocean, yet he seemed speaking\nby my side!\n\n\"They saw how dazed I was by these things, and gave me wine. At that I\ntook heart, for wine, at least, was as it had always been.\n\n\"'You will want to see Paris--the Paris of our time, Henri?' asked\nRastin.\n\n\"'But it is different--terrible--' I said.\n\n\"'We'll take you,' Thicourt said, 'but first your clothes--'\n\n\"He got a long light coat that they had me put on, that covered my tunic\nand hose, and a hat of grotesque round shape that they put on my head.\nThey led me then out of the building and into the street.\n\n\"I gazed astoundedly along that street. It had a raised walk at either\nside, on which many hundreds of people moved to and fro, all dressed in\nas strange a fashion. Many, like Rastin and Thicourt, seemed of gentle\nblood, yet, in spite of this, they did not wear a sword or even a\ndagger. There were no knights or squires, or priests or peasants. All\nseemed dressed much the same.\n\n\"Small lads ran to and fro selling what seemed sheets of very thin white\nparchment, many times folded and covered with lettering. Rastin said\nthat these had written in them all things that had happened through all\nthe world, even but hours before. I said that to write even one of these\nsheets would take a clerk many days, but they said that the writing was\ndone in some way very quickly by machines.\n\n\"In the broad stone street between the two raised walks were rushing\nback and forth the strange vehicles I had seen from the window. There\nwas no animal pulling or pushing any one of them, yet they never halted\ntheir swift rush, and carried many people at unthinkable speed.\nSometimes those who walked stepped before the rushing vehicles, and then\nfrom them came terrible warning snarls or moans that made the walkers\ndraw back.\n\n\"One of the vehicles stood at the walk's edge before us, and we entered\nit and sat side by side on a soft leather seat. Thicourt sat behind a\nwheel on a post, with levers beside him. He touched these and a humming\nsound came from somewhere in the vehicle and then it too began to rush\nforward. Faster and faster along the street it went, yet neither of them\nseemed afraid.\n\n\"Many thousands of these vehicles were moving swiftly through the\nstreets about us. We passed on, between great buildings and along wider\nstreets, my eyes and ears numbed by what I saw about me. Then the\nbuildings grew smaller, after we had gone for miles through them, and\nwe were passing through the city's outskirts. I could not believe,\nhardly, that it was Paris in which I was.\n\n\"We came to a great flat and open field outside the city and there\nThicourt stopped and we got out of the vehicle. There were big buildings\nat the field's end, and I saw other vehicles rolling out of them across\nthe field, ones different from any I had yet seen, with flat winglike\nprojections on either side. They rolled out over the field very fast and\nthen I cried out as I saw them rising from the ground into the air.\nMother of God, they were flying! The men in them were flying!\n\n\"Rastin and Thicourt took me forward to the great buildings. They spoke\nto men there and one brought forward one of the winged cars. Rastin told\nme to get in, and though I was terribly afraid, there was too terrible a\nfascination that drew me in. Thicourt and Rastin entered after me, and\nwe sat in seats with the other man. He had before him levers and\nbuttons, while at the car's front was a great thing like a double-oar or\npaddle. A loud roaring came and that double-blade began to whirl so\nswiftly that I could not see it. Then the car rolled swiftly forward,\nbumping on the ground, and then ceased to bump. I looked down, then\nshuddered. The ground was already far beneath! I too, was flying in the\nair!\n\n\"We swept upward at terrible speed that increased steadily. The thunder\nof the car was terrific, and, as the man at the levers changed their\nposition, we curved around and over downward and upward as though birds.\nRastin tried to explain to me how the car flew, but it was all too\nwonderful, and I could not understand. I only knew that a wild thrilling\nexcitement held me, and that it were worth life and death to fly thus,\nif but for once, as I had always dreamed that men might some day do.\n\n\"Higher and higher we went. The earth lay far beneath and I saw now that\nParis was indeed a mighty city, its vast mass of buildings stretching\naway almost to the horizons below us. A mighty city of the future that\nit had been given my eyes to look on!\n\n\"There were other winged cars darting to and fro in the air about us,\nand they said that many of these were starting or finishing journeys of\nhundreds of leagues in the air. Then I cried out as I saw a great shape\ncoming nearer us in the air. It was many rods in length, tapering to a\npoint at both ends, a vast ship sailing in the air! There were great\ncabins on its lower part and in them we glimpsed people gazing out,\ncoming and going inside, dancing even! They told me that vast ships of\nthe air like this sailed to and fro for thousands of leagues with\nhundreds inside them.\n\n\"The huge vessel of the air passed us and then our winged car began to\ndescend. It circled smoothly down to the field like a swooping bird,\nand, when we landed there, Rastin and Thicourt led me back to the\nground-vehicle. It was late afternoon by then, the sun sinking westward,\nand darkness had descended by the time we rolled back into the great\ncity.\n\n\"But in that city was not darkness! Lights were everywhere in it,\nflashing brilliant lights that shone from its mighty buildings and that\nblinked and burned and ran like water in great symbols upon the\nbuildings above the streets. Their glare was like that of day! We\nstopped before a great building into which Rastin and Thicourt led me.\n\n\"It was vast inside and in it were many people in rows on rows of seats.\nI thought it a cathedral at first but saw soon that it was not. The wall\nat one end of it, toward which all in it were gazing, had on it pictures\nof people, great in size, and those pictures were moving as though\nthemselves alive! And they were talking one to another, too, as though\nwith living voices! I trembled. What magic!\n\n\"With Rastin and Thicourt in seats beside me, I watched the pictures\nenthralled. It was like looking through a great window into strange\nworlds. I saw the sea, seemingly tossing and roaring there before me,\nand then saw on it a ship, a vast ship of size incredible, without sails\nor oars, holding thousands of people. I seemed on that ship as I\nwatched, seemed moving forward with it. They told me it was sailing over\nthe western ocean that never men had crossed. I feared!\n\n\"Then another scene, land appearing from the ship. A great statue,\nupholding a torch, and we on the ship seemed passing beneath it. They\nsaid that the ship was approaching a city, the city of New York, but\nmists hid all before us. Then suddenly the mists before the ship cleared\nand there before me seemed the city.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Mother of God, what a city! Climbing range on range of great\nmountain-like buildings that aspired up as though to scale heaven\nitself! Far beneath narrow streets pierced through them and in\nthe picture we seemed to land from the ship, to go through those\nstreets of the city. It was an incredible city of madness! The\nstreets and ways were mere chasms between the sky-toppling buildings!\nPeople--people--people--millions on millions of them rushed through the\nendless streets. Countless ground-vehicles rushed to and fro also, and\nother different ones that roared above the streets and still others\nbelow them!\n\n\"Winged flying-cars and great airships were sailing to and fro over the\ntitanic city, and in the waters around it great ships of the sea and\nsmaller ships were coming as man never dreamed of surely, that reached\nout from the mighty city on all sides. And with the coming of darkness,\nthe city blazed with living light!\n\n\"The pictures changed, showed other mighty cities, though none so\nterrible as that one. It showed great mechanisms that appalled me. Giant\nmetal things that scooped in an instant from the earth as much as a man\nmight dig in days. Vast things that poured molten metal from them like\nwater. Others that lifted loads that hundreds of men and oxen could not\nhave stirred.\n\n\"They showed men of knowledge like Rastin and Thicourt beside me. Some\nwere healers, working miraculous cures in a way that I could not\nunderstand. Others were gazing through giant tubes at the stars, and the\npictures showed what they saw, showed that all of the stars were great\nsuns like our sun, and that our sun was greater than earth, that earth\nmoved around it instead of the reverse! How could such things be, I\nwondered. Yet they said that it was so, that earth was round like an\napple, and that with other earths like it, the planets, moved round the\nsun. I heard, but could scarce understand.\n\n\"At last Rastin and Thicourt led me out of that place of living pictures\nand to their ground-vehicle. We went again through the streets to their\nbuilding, where first I had found myself. As we went I saw that none\nchallenged my right to go, nor asked who was my lord. And Rastin said\nthat none now had lords, but that all were lord, king and priest and\nnoble, having no more power than any in the land. Each man was his own\nmaster! It was what I had hardly dared to hope for, in my own time, and\nthis, I thought, was greatest of all the marvels they had shown me!\n\n\"We entered again their building but Rastin and Thicourt took me first\nto another room than the one in which I had found myself. They said that\ntheir men of knowledge were gathered there to hear of their feat, and to\nhave it proved to them.\n\n\"'You would not be afraid to return to your own time, Henri?' asked\nRastin, and I shook my head.\n\n\"'I want to return to it,' I told them. 'I want to tell my people there\nwhat I have seen--what the future is that they must strive for.'\n\n\"'But if they should not believe you?' Thicourt asked.\n\n\"'Still I must go--must tell them,' I said.\n\n\"Rastin grasped my hand. 'You are a man, Henri,' he said. Then, throwing\naside the cloak and hat I had worn outside, they went with me down to\nthe big white-walled room where first I had found myself.\n\n\"It was lit brightly now by many of the shining glass things on ceiling\nand walls, and in it were many men. They all stared strangely at me and\nat my clothes, and talked excitedly so fast that I could not understand.\nRastin began to address them.\n\n\"He seemed explaining how he had brought me from my own time to his. He\nused many terms and words that I could not understand, incomprehensible\nreferences and phrases, and I could understand but little. I heard again\nthe names of Einstein and De Sitter that I had heard before, repeated\nfrequently by these men as they disputed with Rastin and Thicourt. They\nseemed disputing about me.\n\n\"One big man was saying, 'Impossible! I tell you, Rastin, you have faked\nthis fellow!'\n\n\"Rastin smiled. 'You don't believe that Thicourt and I brought him here\nfrom his own time across five centuries?'\n\n\"A chorus of excited negatives answered him. He had me stand up and\nspeak to them. They asked me many questions, part of which I could not\nunderstand. I told them of my life, and of the city of my own time, and\nof king and priest and noble, and of many simple things that they seemed\nquite ignorant of. Some appeared to believe me but others did not, and\nagain their dispute broke out.\n\n\"'There is a way to settle the argument, gentlemen,' said Rastin\nfinally.\n\n\"'How?' all cried.\n\n\"'Thicourt and I brought Henri across five centuries by rotating the\ntime-dimensions at this spot,' he said. 'Suppose we reverse that\nrotation and send him back before your eyes--would that be proof?'\n\n\"They all said that it would. Rastin turned to me. 'Stand on the metal\ncircle, Henri,' he said. I did so.\n\n\"All were watching very closely. Thicourt did something quickly with the\nlevers and buttons of the mechanisms in the room. They began to hum, and\nblue light came from the glass tubes on some. All were quiet, watching\nme as I stood there on the circle of metal. I met Rastin's eyes and\nsomething in me made me call goodbye to him. He waved his hand and\nsmiled. Thicourt pressed more buttons and the hum of the mechanisms grew\nlouder. Then he reached toward another lever. All in the room were\ntense and I was tense.\n\n\"Then I saw Thicourt's arm move as he turned one of the many levers.\n\n\"A terrific clap of thunder seemed to break around me, and as I closed\nmy eyes before its shock, I felt myself whirling around and falling at\nthe same time as though into a maelstrom, just as I had done before. The\nawful falling sensation ceased in a moment and the sound subsided. I\nopened my eyes. I was on the ground at the center of the familiar field\nfrom which I had vanished hours before, upon the morning of that day. It\nwas night now, though, for that day I had spent five hundred years in\nthe future.\n\n\"There were many people gathered around the field, fearful, and they\nscreamed and some fled when I appeared in the thunderclap. I went toward\nthose who remained. My mind was full of things I had seen and I wanted\nto tell them of these things. I wanted to tell them how they must work\never toward that future time of wonder.\n\n\"But they did not listen. Before I had spoken minutes to them they cried\nout on me as a sorcerer and a blasphemer, and seized me and brought me\nhere to the Inquisitor, to you, sire. And to you, sire, I have told the\ntruth in all things. I know that in doing so I have set the seal of my\nown fate, and that only a sorcerer would ever tell such a tale, yet\ndespite that I am glad. Glad that I have told one at least of this time\nof what I saw five centuries in the future. Glad that I saw! Glad that I\nsaw the things that someday, sometime, must come to be--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a week later that they burned Henri Lothiere. Jean de Marselait,\nlifting his gaze from his endless parchment accusation and examens on\nthat afternoon, looked out through the window at a thick curl of black\nsmoke going up from the distant square.\n\n\"Strange, that one,\" he mused. \"A sorcerer, of course, but such a one as\nI had never heard before. I wonder,\" he half-whispered, \"was there any\ntruth in that wild tale of his? The future--who can say--what men might\ndo--?\"\n\nThere was silence in the room as he brooded for a moment, and then he\nshook himself as one ridding himself of absurd speculations. \"But\ntush--enough of these crazy fancies. They will have me for a sorcerer if\nI yield to these wild fancies and visions _of the future_.\"\n\nAnd bending again with his pen to the parchment before him, he went\ngravely on with his work.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ February 1961, first\n    published in _Amazing Stories_ October 1930.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
