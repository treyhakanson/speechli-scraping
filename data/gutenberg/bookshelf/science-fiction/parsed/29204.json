Harry Harrison, who will be\n    remembered for his THE VELVET GLOVE (Nov. 1956) and his more recent\n    TRAINEE FOR MARS (June 1958) tells what happens when a police robot\n    hits an outpost on Mars._\n\n\n arm\n  of\n the\n law\n\n _by ... Harry Harrison_\n\n\n At one time--this was before the Robot\n Restriction Laws--they'd even allowed\n them to make their own decisions....\n\n\nIt was a big, coffin-shaped plywood box that looked like it weighed a\nton. This brawny type just dumped it through the door of the police\nstation and started away. I looked up from the blotter and shouted at\nthe trucker's vanishing back.\n\n\"What the hell is that?\"\n\n\"How should I know?\" he said as he swung up into the cab. \"I just\ndeliver, I don't X-ray 'em. It came on the morning rocket from earth is\nall I know.\" He gunned the truck more than he had to and threw up a\nbillowing cloud of red dust.\n\n\"Jokers,\" I growled to myself. \"Mars is full of jokers.\"\n\nWhen I went over to look at the box I could feel the dust grate between\nmy teeth. Chief Craig must have heard the racket because he came out of\nhis office and helped me stand and look at the box.\n\n\"Think it's a bomb?\" he asked in a bored voice.\n\n\"Why would anyone bother--particularly with a thing this size? And all\nthe way from earth.\"\n\nHe nodded agreement and walked around to look at the other end. There\nwas no sender's address anywhere on the outside. Finally we had to dig\nout the crowbar and I went to work on the top. After some prying it\npulled free and fell off.\n\nThat was when we had our first look at Ned. We all would have been a lot\nhappier if it had been our last look as well. If we had just put the lid\nback on and shipped the thing back to earth! I know now what they mean\nabout Pandora's Box.\n\nBut we just stood there and stared like a couple of rubes. Ned lay\nmotionless and stared back at us.\n\n\"A robot!\" the Chief said.\n\n\"Very observant; it's easy to see you went to the police academy.\"\n\n\"Ha ha! Now find out what he's doing here.\"\n\nI hadn't gone to the academy, but this was no handicap to my finding the\nletter. It was sticking up out of a thick book in a pocket in the box.\nThe Chief took the letter and read it with little enthusiasm.\n\n\"Well, well! United Robotics have the brainstorm that ... _robots,\ncorrectly used will tend to prove invaluable in police work_ ... they\nwant us to co-operate in a field test ... _robot enclosed is the latest\nexperimental model; valued at 120,000 credits_.\"\n\nWe both looked back at the robot, sharing the wish that the credits had\nbeen in the box instead of it. The Chief frowned and moved his lips\nthrough the rest of the letter. I wondered how we got the robot out of\nits plywood coffin.\n\nExperimental model or not, this was a nice-looking hunk of machinery. A\nuniform navy-blue all over, though the outlet cases, hooks and such were\na metallic gold. Someone had gone to a lot of trouble to get that\neffect. This was as close as a robot could look to a cop in uniform,\nwithout being a joke. All that seemed to be missing was the badge and\ngun.\n\nThen I noticed the tiny glow of light in the robot's eye lenses. It had\nnever occurred to me before that the thing might be turned on. There was\nnothing to lose by finding out.\n\n\"Get out of that box,\" I said.\n\nThe robot came up smooth and fast as a rocket, landing two feet in front\nof me and whipping out a snappy salute.\n\n\"Police Experimental Robot, serial number XPO-456-934B, reporting for\nduty, sir.\"\n\nHis voice quivered with alertness and I could almost hear the humming of\nthose taut cable muscles. He may have had a stainless steel hide and a\nbunch of wires for a brain--but he spelled rookie cop to me just the\nsame. The fact that he was man-height with two arms, two legs and that\npainted-on uniform helped. All I had to do was squint my eyes a bit and\nthere stood Ned the Rookie Cop. Fresh out of school and raring to go. I\nshook my head to get rid of the illusion. This was just six feet of\nmachine that boffins and brain-boys had turned out for their own\namusement.\n\n\"Relax, Ned,\" I said. He was still holding the salute. \"At ease. You'll\nget a hernia of your exhaust pipe if you stay so tense. Anyways, I'm\njust the sergeant here. That's the Chief of Police over there.\"\n\nNed did an about face and slid over to the Chief with that same\ngreased-lightning motion. The Chief just looked at him like something\nthat sprang out from under the hood of a car, while Ned went through the\nsame report routine.\n\n\"I wonder if it does anything else beside salute and report,\" the Chief\nsaid while he walked around the robot, looking it over like a dog with a\nhydrant.\n\n\"The functions, operations and responsible courses of action open to the\nPolice Experimental Robots are outlined on pages 184 to 213 of the\nmanual.\" Ned's voice was muffled for a second while he half-dived back\ninto his case and came up with the volume mentioned. \"A detailed\nbreakdown of these will also be found on pages 1035 to 1267 inclusive.\"\n\nThe Chief, who has trouble reading an entire comic page at one sitting,\nturned the 6-inch-thick book over in his hands like it would maybe bite\nhim. When he had a rough idea of how much it weighed and a good feel of\nthe binding he threw it on my desk.\n\n\"Take care of this,\" he said to me as he headed towards his office. \"And\nthe robot, too. Do something with it.\" The Chief's span of attention\nnever was great and it had been strained to the limit this time.\n\nI flipped through the book, wondering. One thing I never have had much\nto do with is robots, so I know just as much about them as any Joe in\nthe street. Probably less. The book was filled with pages of fine print,\nfancy mathematics, wiring diagrams and charts in nine colors and that\nkind of thing. It needed close attention. Which attention I was not\nprepared to give at the time. The book slid shut and I eyed the newest\nemployee of the city of Nineport.\n\n\"There is a broom behind the door. Do you know how to use it?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"In that case you will sweep out this room, raising as small a cloud of\ndust as possible at the same time.\"\n\nHe did a very neat job of it.\n\nI watched 120,000 credits worth of machinery making a tidy pile of butts\nand sand and wondered why it had been sent to Nineport. Probably because\nthere wasn't another police force in the solar system that was smaller\nor more unimportant than ours. The engineers must have figured this\nwould be a good spot for a field test. Even if the thing blew up, nobody\nwould really mind. There would probably be someone along some day to get\na report on it. Well, they had picked the right spot all right. Nineport\nwas just a little bit beyond nowhere.\n\nWhich, of course, was why I was there. I was the only real cop on the\nforce. They needed at least one to give an illusion of the wheels going\naround. The Chief, Alonzo Craig, had just enough sense to take graft\nwithout dropping the money. There were two patrolmen. One old and drunk\nmost of the time. The other so young the only scar he had was the mark\nof the attram. I had ten years on a metropolitan force, earthside. Why I\nleft is nobody's damn business. I have long since paid for any mistakes\nI made there by ending up in Nineport.\n\nNineport is not a city, it's just a place where people stop. The only\npermanent citizens are the ones who cater to those on the way through.\nHotel keepers, restaurant owners, gamblers, barkeeps, and the rest.\n\nThere is a spaceport, but only some freighters come there. To pick up\nthe metal from some of the mines that are still working. Some of the\nsettlers still came in for supplies. You might say that Nineport was a\ntown that just missed the boat. In a hundred years I doubt if there will\nbe enough left sticking of the sand to even tell where it used to be. I\nwon't be there either, so I couldn't care less.\n\nI went back to the blotter. Five drunks in the tank, an average night's\nhaul. While I wrote them up Fats dragged in the sixth one.\n\n\"Locked himself in the ladies' john at the spaceport and resisting\narrest,\" he reported.\n\n\"D and D. Throw him in with the rest.\"\n\nFats steered his limp victim across the floor, matching him step for\ndragging step. I always marveled at the way Fats took care of drunks,\nsince he usually had more under his belt than they had. I have never\nseen him falling down drunk or completely sober. About all he was good\nfor was keeping a blurred eye on the lockup and running in drunks. He\ndid well at that. No matter what they crawled under or on top of, he\nfound them. No doubt due to the same shared natural instincts.\n\nFats clanged the door behind number six and weaved his way back in.\n\"What's that?\" he asked, peering at the robot along the purple beauty of\nhis nose.\n\n\"That is a robot. I have forgotten the number his mother gave him at the\nfactory so we will call him Ned. He works here now.\"\n\n\"Good for him! He can clean up the tank after we throw the bums out.\"\n\n\"That's _my_ job,\" Billy said coming in through the front door. He\nclutched his nightstick and scowled out from under the brim of his\nuniform cap. It is not that Billy is stupid, just that most of his\nstrength has gone into his back instead of his mind.\n\n\"That's Ned's job now because you have a promotion. You are going to\nhelp me with some of my work.\"\n\nBilly came in very handy at times and I was anxious that the force\nshouldn't lose him. My explanation cheered him because he sat down by\nFats and watched Ned do the floor.\n\nThat's the way things went for about a week. We watched Ned sweep and\npolish until the station began to take on a positively antiseptic look.\nThe Chief, who always has an eye out for that type of thing, found out\nthat Ned could file the odd ton of reports and paperwork that cluttered\nhis office. All this kept the robot busy, and we got so used to him we\nwere hardly aware he was around. I knew he had moved the packing case\ninto the storeroom and fixed himself up a cozy sort of robot\ndormitory-coffin. Other than that I didn't know or care.\n\nThe operation manual was buried in my desk and I never looked at it. If\nI had, I might have had some idea of the big changes that were in store.\nNone of us knew the littlest bit about what a robot can or cannot do.\nNed was working nicely as a combination janitor-file clerk and should\nhave stayed that way. He would have too if the Chief hadn't been so\nlazy. That's what started it all.\n\nIt was around nine at night and the Chief was just going home when the\ncall came in. He took it, listened for a moment, then hung up.\n\n\"Greenback's liquor store. He got held up again. Says to come at once.\"\n\n\"That's a change. Usually we don't hear about it until a month later.\nWhat's he paying protection money for if China Joe ain't protecting?\nWhat's the rush now?\"\n\nThe Chief chewed his loose lip for a while, finally and painfully\nreached a decision.\n\n\"You better go around and see what the trouble is.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I said reaching for my cap. \"But no one else is around, you'll\nhave to watch the desk until I get back.\"\n\n\"That's no good,\" he moaned. \"I'm dying from hunger and sitting here\nisn't going to help me any.\"\n\n\"I will go take the report,\" Ned said, stepping forward and snapping his\nusual well-greased salute.\n\nAt first the Chief wasn't buying. You would think the water cooler came\nto life and offered to take over his job.\n\n\"How could _you_ take a report?\" he growled, putting the wise-guy water\ncooler in its place. But he had phrased his little insult as a question\nso he had only himself to blame. In exactly three minutes Ned gave the\nChief a summary of the routine necessary for a police officer to make a\nreport on an armed robbery or other reported theft. From the glazed look\nin Chief's protruding eyes I could tell Ned had quickly passed the\nboundaries of the Chief's meager knowledge.\n\n\"Enough!\" the harried man finally gasped. \"If you know so much why don't\nyou make a report?\"\n\nWhich to me sounded like another version of \"_if you're so damned smart\nwhy ain't you rich?_\" which we used to snarl at the brainy kids in\ngrammar school. Ned took such things literally though, and turned\ntowards the door.\n\n\"Do you mean you wish me to make a report on this robbery?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the Chief said just to get rid of him, and we watched his blue\nshape vanish through the door.\n\n\"He must be brighter than he looks,\" I said. \"He never stopped to ask\nwhere Greenback's store is.\"\n\nThe Chief nodded and the phone rang again. His hand was still resting on\nit so he picked it up by reflex. He listened for a second and you would\nhave thought someone was pumping blood out of his heel from the way his\nface turned white.\n\n\"The holdup's still on,\" he finally gasped. \"Greenback's delivery boy is\non the line--calling back to see where we are. Says he's under a table\nin the back room ...\"\n\nI never heard the rest of it because I was out the door and into the\ncar. There were a hundred things that could happen if Ned got there\nbefore me. Guns could go off, people hurt, lots of things. And the\npolice would be to blame for it all--sending a tin robot to do a cop's\njob. Maybe the Chief had ordered Ned there, but clearly as if the words\nwere painted on the windshield of the car, I knew I would be dragged\ninto it. It never gets very warm on Mars, but I was sweating.\n\nNineport has fourteen traffic regulations and I broke all of them before\nI had gone a block. Fast as I was, Ned was faster. As I turned the\ncorner I saw him open the door of Greenback's store and walk in. I\nscreamed brakes in behind him and arrived just in time to have a gallery\nseat. A shooting gallery at that.\n\nThere were two holdup punks, one behind the counter making like a clerk\nand the other lounging off to the side. Their guns were out of sight,\nbut blue-coated Ned busting through the door like that was too much for\ntheir keyed up nerves. Up came both guns like they were on strings and\nNed stopped dead. I grabbed for my own gun and waited for pieces of\nbusted robot to come flying through the window.\n\nNed's reflexes were great. Which I suppose is what you should expect of\na robot.\n\n\"DROP YOUR GUNS, YOU ARE UNDER ARREST.\"\n\nHe must have had on full power or something, his voice blasted so loud\nmy ears hurt. The result was just what you might expect. Both torpedoes\nlet go at once and the air was filled with flying slugs. The show\nwindows went out with a crash and I went down on my stomach. From the\namount of noise I knew they both had recoilless .50's. You can't stop\none of those slugs. They go right through you and anything else that\nhappens to be in the way.\n\nExcept they didn't seem to be bothering Ned. The only notice he seemed\nto take was to cover his eyes. A little shield with a thin slit popped\ndown over his eye lenses. Then he moved in on the first thug.\n\nI knew he was fast, but not that fast. A couple of slugs jarred him as\nhe came across the room, but before the punk could change his aim Ned\nhad the gun in his hand. That was the end of that. He put on one of the\nsweetest hammer locks I have ever seen and neatly grabbed the gun when\nit dropped from the limp fingers. With the same motion that slipped the\ngun into a pouch he whipped out a pair of handcuffs and snapped them on\nthe punk's wrists.\n\nHoldupnik number two was heading for the door by then, and I was waiting\nto give him a warm reception. There was never any need. He hadn't gone\nhalfway before Ned slid in front of him. There was a thud when they hit\nthat didn't even shake Ned, but gave the other a glazed look. He never\neven knew it when Ned slipped the cuffs on him and dropped him down next\nto his partner.\n\nI went in, took their guns from Ned, and made the arrest official. That\nwas all Greenback saw when he crawled out from behind the counter and it\nwas all I wanted him to see. The place was a foot deep in broken glass\nand smelled like the inside of a Jack Daniels bottle. Greenback began to\nhowl like a wolf over his lost stock. He didn't seem to know any more\nabout the phone call than I did, so I grabbed ahold of a pimply looking\nkid who staggered out of the storeroom. He was the one who had made the\ncalls.\n\nIt turned out to be a matter of sheer stupidity. He had worked for\nGreenback only a few days and didn't have enough brains to realize that\nall holdups should be reported to the protection boys instead of the\npolice. I told Greenback to wise up his boy, as look at the trouble that\ngot caused. Then pushed the two ex-holdup men out to the car. Ned\nclimbed in back with them and they clung together like two waifs in a\nstorm. The robot's only response was to pull a first aid kit from his\nhip and fix up a ricochet hole in one of the thugs that no one had\nnoticed in the excitement.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Chief was still sitting there with that bloodless look when we\nmarched in. I didn't believe it could be done, but he went two shades\nwhiter.\n\n\"You made the pinch,\" he whispered. Before I could straighten him out a\nsecond and more awful idea hit him. He grabbed a handful of shirt on the\nfirst torpedo and poked his face down. \"You with China Joe,\" he snarled.\n\nThe punk made the error of trying to be cute so the Chief let him have\none on the head with the open hand that set his eyes rolling like\nmarbles. When the question got asked again he found the right answer.\n\n\"I never heard from no China Joe. We just hit town today and--\"\n\n\"Freelance, by God,\" the Chief sighed and collapsed into his chair.\n\"Lock 'em up and quickly tell me what in hell happened.\"\n\nI slammed the gate on them and pointed a none too steady finger at Ned.\n\n\"There's the hero,\" I said. \"Took them on single-handed, rassled them\nfor a fall and made the capture. He is a one-robot tornado, a power for\ngood in this otherwise evil community. And he's bulletproof too.\" I ran\na finger over Ned's broad chest. The paint was chipped by the slugs, but\nthe metal was hardly scratched.\n\n\"This is going to cause me trouble, big trouble,\" the Chief wailed.\n\nI knew he meant with the protection boys. They did not like punks\ngetting arrested and guns going off without their okay. But Ned thought\nthe Chief had other worries and rushed in to put them right. \"There will\nbe no trouble. At no time did I violate any of the Robotic Restriction\nLaws, they are part of my control circuits and therefore fully\nautomatic. The men who drew their guns violated both robotic and human\nlaw when they threatened violence. I did not injure the men--merely\nrestrained them.\"\n\nIt was all over the Chief's head, but I liked to think _I_ could follow\nit. And I _had_ been wondering how a robot--a machine--could be involved\nin something like law application and violence. Ned had the answer to\nthat one too.\n\n\"Robots have been assuming these functions for years. Don't recording\nradar meters pass judgment on human violation of automobile regulations?\nA robot alcohol detector is better qualified to assess the sobriety of a\nprisoner than the arresting officer. At one time robots were even\nallowed to make their own decisions about killing. Before the Robotic\nRestriction Laws automatic gun-pointers were in general use. Their final\ndevelopment was a self-contained battery of large anti-aircraft guns.\nAutomatic scan radar detected all aircraft in the vicinity. Those that\ncould not return the correct identifying signal had their courses\ntracked and computed, automatic fuse-cutters and loaders readied the\ncomputer-aimed guns--which were fired by the robot mechanism.\"\n\nThere was little I could argue about with Ned. Except maybe his\ncollege-professor vocabulary. So I switched the attack.\n\n\"But a robot can't take the place of a cop, it's a complex human job.\"\n\n\"Of course it is, but taking a human policeman's place is not the\nfunction of a police robot. Primarily I combine the functions of\nnumerous pieces of police equipment, integrating their operations and\nmaking them instantly available. In addition I can aid in the\n_mechanical_ processes of law enforcement. If you arrest a man you\nhandcuff him. But if you order me to do it, I have made no moral\ndecision. I am just a machine for attaching handcuffs at that point ...\"\n\nMy raised hand cut off the flow of robotic argument. Ned was hipped to\nhis ears with facts and figures and I had a good idea who would come off\nsecond best in any continued discussion. No laws had been broken when\nNed made the pinch, that was for sure. But there are other laws than\nthose that appear on the books.\n\n\"China Joe is not going to like this, not at all,\" the Chief said,\nspeaking my own thoughts.\n\nThe law of Tooth and Claw. That's one that wasn't in the law books. And\nthat was what ran Nineport. The place was just big enough to have a good\npopulation of gambling joints, bawdy houses and drunk-rollers. They were\nall run by China Joe. As was the police department. We were all in his\npocket and you might say he was the one who paid our wages. This is not\nthe kind of thing, though, that you explain to a robot.\n\n\"Yeah, China Joe.\"\n\nI thought it was an echo at first, then realized that someone had eased\nin the door behind me. Something called Alex. Six feet of bone, muscle\nand trouble. China Joe's right hand man. He imitated a smile at the\nChief who sank a bit lower in his chair.\n\n\"China Joe wants you should tell him why you got smart cops going around\nand putting the arm on people and letting them shoot up good liquor.\nHe's mostly angry about the hooch. He says that he had enough guff and\nafter this you should--\"\n\n\"I am putting you under Robot Arrest, pursuant to article 46, paragraph\n19 of the revised statutes ...\"\n\nNed had done it before we realized he had even moved. Right in front of\nour eyes he was arresting Alex and signing our death warrants.\n\nAlex was not slow. As he turned to see who had grabbed him, he had\nalready dragged out this cannon. He got one shot in, square against\nNed's chest, before the robot plucked the gun away and slipped on the\ncuffs. While we all gaped like dead fish, Ned recited the charge in what\nI swear was a satisfied tone.\n\n\"The prisoner is Peter Rakjomskj, alias Alex the Axe, wanted in Canal\nCity for armed robbery and attempted murder. Also wanted by local police\nof Detroit, New York and Manchester on charges of ...\"\n\n\"_Get it off me!_\" Alex howled. We might have too, and everything might\nhave still been straightened out if Benny Bug hadn't heard the shot. He\npopped his head in the front door just long enough to roll his eyes over\nour little scene.\n\n\"Alex ... they're puttin' the arm on Alex!\"\n\nThen he was gone and when I hit the door he was nowhere in sight. China\nJoe's boys always went around in pairs. And in ten minutes he would know\nall about it.\n\n\"Book him,\" I told Ned. \"It wouldn't make any difference if we let him\ngo now. The world has already come to an end.\"\n\nFats came in then, mumbling to himself. He jerked a thumb over his\nshoulder when he saw me.\n\n\"What's up? I see little Benny Bug come out of here like the place was\non fire and almost get killed driving away?\"\n\nThen Fats saw Alex with the bracelets on and turned sober in one second.\nHe just took a moment to gape, then his mind was made up. Without a\ntrace of a stagger he walked over to the Chief and threw his badge on\nthe desk in front of him.\n\n\"I am an old man and I drink too much to be a cop. Therefore I am\nresigning from the force. Because if that is whom I think it is over\nthere with the cuffs on, I will not live to be a day older as long as I\nam around here.\"\n\n\"Rat.\" The Chief growled in pain through his clenched teeth. \"Deserting\nthe sinking ship. Rat.\"\n\n\"Squeak,\" Fats said and left.\n\nThe Chief was beyond caring at this point. He didn't blink an eye when I\ntook Fats' badge off the desk. I don't know why I did it, perhaps I\nthought it was only fair. Ned had started all the trouble and I was just\nangry enough to want him on the spot when it was finished. There were\ntwo rings on his chest plate, and I was not surprised when the badge pin\nfitted them neatly.\n\n\"There, now you are a real cop.\" Sarcasm dripped from the words. I\nshould have realized that robots are immune to sarcasm. Ned took my\nstatement at face value.\n\n\"This is a very great honor, not only for me but for all robots. I will\ndo my best to fulfill all the obligations of the office.\" Jack Armstrong\nin tin underwear. I could hear the little motors in his guts humming\nwith joy as he booked Alex.\n\nIf everything else hadn't been so bad I would have enjoyed that. Ned had\nmore police equipment built into him than Nineport had ever owned. There\nwas an ink pad that snapped out of one hip, and he efficiently rolled\nAlex's fingertips across it and stamped them on a card. Then he held the\nprisoner at arm's length while something clicked in his abdomen. Once\nmore sideways and two instant photographs dropped out of a slot. The mug\nshots were stuck on the card, arrest details and such inserted. There\nwas more like this, but I forced myself away. There were more important\nthings to think about.\n\nLike staying alive.\n\n\"Any ideas, Chief?\"\n\nA groan was my only answer so I let it go at that. Billy, the balance of\nthe police force, came in then. I gave him a quick rundown. Either\nthrough stupidity or guts he elected to stay, and I was proud of the\nboy. Ned locked away the latest prisoner and began sweeping up.\n\nThat was the way we were when China Joe walked in.\n\nEven though we were expecting it, it was still a shock. He had a bunch\nof his toughest hoods with him and they crowded through the door like an\noverweight baseball team. China Joe was in front, hands buried in the\nsleeves of his long mandarin gown. No expression at all on his ascetic\nfeatures. He didn't waste time talking to us, just gave the word to his\nown boys.\n\n\"Clean this place up. The new police Chief will be here in a while and I\ndon't want him to see any bums hanging around.\"\n\nIt made me angry. Even with the graft I like to feel I'm still a cop.\nNot on a cheap punk's payroll. I was also curious about China Joe. Had\nbeen ever since I tried to get a line on him and never found a thing. I\nstill wanted to know.\n\n\"Ned, take a good look at that Chinese guy in the rayon bathrobe and let\nme know who he is.\"\n\nMy, but those electronic circuits work fast. Ned shot the answer back\nlike a straight man who had been rehearsing his lines for weeks.\n\n\"He is a pseudo-oriental, utilizing a natural sallowness of the skin\nheightened with dye. He is not Chinese. There has also been an operation\non his eyes, scars of which are still visible. This has been undoubtedly\ndone in an attempt to conceal his real identity, but Bertillon\nmeasurements of his ears and other features make identity positive. He\nis on the Very Wanted list of Interpol and his real name is ...\"\n\nChina Joe was angry, and with a reason.\n\n\"That's the _thing_ ... that big-mouthed tin radio set over there. We\nheard about it and we're taking care of it!\"\n\nThe mob jumped aside then or hit the deck and I saw there was a guy\nkneeling in the door with a rocket launcher. Shaped anti-tank charges,\nno doubt. That was my last thought as the thing let go with a \"whoosh.\"\n\nMaybe you can hit a tank with one of those. But not a robot. At least\nnot a police robot. Ned was sliding across the floor on his face when\nthe back wall blew up. There was no second shot. Ned closed his hand on\nthe tube of the bazooka and it was so much old drainpipe.\n\nBilly decided then that anyone who fired a rocket in a police station\nwas breaking the law, so he moved in with his club. I was right behind\nhim since I did not want to miss any of the fun. Ned was at the bottom\nsomewhere, but I didn't doubt he could take care of himself.\n\nThere were a couple of muffled shots and someone screamed. No one fired\nafter that because we were too tangled up. A punk named Brooklyn Eddie\nhit me on the side of the head with his gunbutt and I broke his nose\nall over his face with my fist.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere is a kind of a fog over everything after that. But I do remember\nit was very busy for a while.\n\nWhen the fog lifted a bit I realized I was the only one still standing.\nOr leaning rather. It was a good thing the wall was there.\n\nNed came in through the street door carrying a very bashed-looking\nBrooklyn Eddie. I hoped I had done all that. Eddie's wrists were\nfastened together with cuffs. Ned laid him gently next to the heap of\nthugs--who I suddenly realized all wore the same kind of handcuffs. I\nwondered vaguely if Ned made them as he needed them or had a supply\ntucked away in a hollow leg or something.\n\nThere was a chair a few feet away and sitting down helped.\n\nBlood was all over everything and if a couple of the hoods hadn't\ngroaned I would have thought they were corpses. One was, I noticed\nsuddenly. A bullet had caught him in the chest, most of the blood was\nprobably his.\n\nNed burrowed in the bodies for a moment and dragged Billy out. He was\nunconscious. A big smile on his face and the splintered remains of his\nnightstick still stuck in his fist. It takes very little to make some\npeople happy. A bullet had gone through his leg and he never moved while\nNed ripped the pants leg off and put on a bandage.\n\n\"The spurious China Joe and one other man escaped in a car,\" Ned\nreported.\n\n\"Don't let it worry you,\" I managed to croak. \"Your batting average\nstill leads the league.\"\n\nIt was then I realized the Chief was still sitting in his chair, where\nhe had been when the brouhaha started. Still slumped down with that\nglazed look. Only after I started to talk to him did I realize that\nAlonzo Craig, Chief of Police of Nineport, was now dead.\n\nA single shot. Small caliber gun, maybe a .22. Right through the heart\nand what blood there had been was soaked up by his clothes. I had a good\nidea where the gun would be that fired that shot. A small gun, the kind\nthat would fit in a wide Chinese sleeve.\n\nI wasn't tired or groggy any more. Just angry. Maybe he hadn't been the\nbrightest or most honest guy in the world. But he deserved a better end\nthan that. Knocked off by a two-bit racket boss who thought he was being\ncrossed.\n\nRight about then I realized I had a big decision to make. With Billy out\nof the fight and Fats gone I was the Nineport police force. All I had to\ndo to be clear of this mess was to walk out the door and keep going. I\nwould be safe enough.\n\nNed buzzed by, picked up two of the thugs, and hauled them off to the\ncells.\n\nMaybe it was the sight of his blue back or maybe I was tired of running.\nEither way my mind was made up before I realized it. I carefully took\noff the Chief's gold badge and put it on in place of my old one.\n\n\"The new Chief of Police of Nineport,\" I said to no one in particular.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Ned said as he passed. He put one of the prisoners down long\nenough to salute, then went on with his work. I returned the salute.\n\nThe hospital meat wagon hauled away the dead and wounded. I took an evil\npleasure in ignoring the questioning stares of the attendants. After the\ndoc fixed the side of my head, everyone cleared out. Ned mopped up the\nfloor. I ate ten aspirin and waited for the hammering to stop so I could\nthink what to do next.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I pulled my thoughts together the answer was obvious. Too obvious.\nI made as long a job as I could of reloading my gun.\n\n\"Refill your handcuff box, Ned. We are going out.\"\n\nLike a good cop he asked no questions. I locked the outside door when we\nleft and gave him the key.\n\n\"Here. There's a good chance you will be the only one left to use this\nbefore the day is over.\"\n\nI stretched the drive over to China Joe's place just as much as I could.\nTrying to figure if there was another way of doing it. There wasn't.\nMurder had been done and Joe was the boy I was going to pin it on. So I\nhad to get him.\n\nThe best I could do was stop around the corner and give Ned a briefing.\n\n\"This combination bar and dice-room is the sole property of he whom we\nwill still call China Joe until there is time for you to give me a\nrundown on him. Right now I got enough distractions. What we have to do\nis go in there, find Joe and bring him to justice. Simple?\"\n\n\"Simple,\" Ned answered in his sharp Joe-college voice. \"But wouldn't it\nbe simpler to make the arrest now, when he is leaving in that car,\ninstead of waiting until he returns?\"\n\nThe car in mention was doing sixty as it came out of the alley ahead of\nus. I only had a glimpse of Joe in the back seat as it tore by us.\n\n\"Stop them!\" I shouted, mostly for my own benefit since I was driving. I\ntried to shift gears and start the engine at the same time, and\nsucceeded in doing exactly nothing.\n\nSo Ned stopped them. It had been phrased as an order. He leaned his head\nout of the window and I saw at once why most of his equipment was\nlocated in his torso. Probably his brain as well. There sure wasn't much\nroom left in his head when that cannon was tucked away in there.\n\nA .75 recoilless. A plate swiveled back right where his nose should have\nbeen if he had one, and the big muzzle pointed out. It's a neat idea\nwhen you think about it. Right between the eyes for good aiming, up\nhigh, always ready.\n\nThe BOOM BOOM almost took my head off. Of course Ned was a perfect\nshot--so would I be with a computer for a brain. He had holed one rear\ntire with each slug and the car flap-flapped to a stop a little ways\ndown the road. I climbed out slowly while Ned sprinted there in seconds\nflat. They didn't even try to run this time. What little nerve they had\nleft must have been shattered by the smoking muzzle of that .75 poking\nout from between Ned's eyes. Robots are neat about things like that so\nhe must have left it sticking out deliberate. Probably had a course in\npsychology back in robot school.\n\nThree of them in the car, all waving their hands in the air like the\nlast reel of a western. And the rear floor covered with interesting\nlittle suitcases.\n\nEveryone came along quietly.\n\nChina Joe only snarled while Ned told me that his name really was\nStantin and the Elmira hot seat was kept warm all the time in hopes he\nwould be back. I promised Joe-Stantin I would be happy to arrange it\nthat same day. Thereby not worrying about any slip-ups with the local\nauthorities. The rest of the mob would stand trial in Canal City.\n\nIt was a very busy day.\n\nThings have quieted down a good deal since then. Billy is out of the\nhospital and wearing my old sergeant's stripes. Even Fats is back,\nthough he is sober once in a while now and has trouble looking me in the\neye. We don't have much to do because in addition to being a quiet town\nthis is now an honest one.\n\nNed is on foot patrol nights and in charge of the lab and files days.\nMaybe the Policeman's Benevolent wouldn't like that, but Ned doesn't\nseem to mind. He touched up all the bullet scratches and keeps his badge\npolished. I know a robot can't be happy or sad--but Ned _seems_ to be\nhappy.\n\nSometimes I would swear I can hear him humming to himself. But, of\ncourse, that is only the motors and things going around.\n\nWhen you start thinking about it, I suppose we set some kind of\nprecedent here. What with putting on a robot as a full-fledged police\nofficer. No one ever came around from the factory yet, so I have never\nfound out if we're the first or not.\n\nAnd I'll tell you something else. I'm not going to stay in this\nbroken-down town forever. I have some letters out now, looking for a new\njob.\n\nSo some people are going to be _very_ surprised when they see who their\nnew Chief of Police is after _I_ leave.\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ August 1958.\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
