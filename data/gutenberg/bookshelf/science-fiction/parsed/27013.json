Simak\n\n\n Weird are the conditions of the\n interdimensional struggle faced\n by Dr. White's ninety-nine men.\n\n\nThe paper had gone to press, graphically describing the latest of the\nmany horrible events which had been enacted upon the Earth in the last\nsix months. The headlines screamed that Six Corners, a little hamlet in\nPennsylvania, had been wiped out by the Horror. Another front-page\nstory told of a Terror in the Amazon Valley which had sent the natives\ndown the river in babbling fear. Other stories told of deaths here and\nthere, all attributable to the \"Black Horror,\" as it was called.\n\nThe telephone rang.\n\n\"Hello,\" said the editor.\n\n\"London calling,\" came the voice of the operator.\n\n\"All right,\" replied the editor.\n\nHe recognized the voice of Terry Masters, special correspondent. His\nvoice came clearly over the transatlantic telephone.\n\n\"The Horror is attacking London in force,\" he said. \"There are thousands\nof them and they have completely surrounded the city. All roads are\nblocked. The government declared the city under martial rule a quarter\nof an hour ago and efforts are being made to prepare for resistance\nagainst the enemy.\"\n\n\"Just a second,\" the editor shouted into the transmitter.\n\nHe touched a button on his desk and in a moment an answering buzz told\nhim he was in communication with the press-room.\n\n\"Stop the presses!\" he yelled into the speaking tube. \"Get ready for a\nnew front make-up!\"\n\n\"O.K.,\" came faintly through the tube, and the editor turned back to the\nphone.\n\n\"Now let's have it,\" he said, and the voice at the London end of the\nwire droned on, telling the story that in another half hour was read by\na world which shuddered in cold fear even as it scanned the glaring\nheadlines.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Woods,\" said the editor of the _Press_ to a reporter, \"run over and\ntalk to Dr. Silas White. He phoned me to send someone. Something about\nthis Horror business.\"\n\nHenry Woods rose from his chair without a word and walked from the\noffice. As he passed the wire machine it was tapping out, with a\nmaddeningly methodical slowness, the story of the fall of London. Only\nhalf an hour before it had rapped forth the flashes concerning the\nattack on Paris and Berlin.\n\nHe passed out of the building into a street that was swarming with\nterrified humanity. Six months of terror, of numerous mysterious deaths,\nof villages blotted out, had set the world on edge. Now with London in\npossession of the Horror and Paris and Berlin fighting hopelessly for\ntheir lives, the entire population of the world was half insane with\nfright.\n\nExhorters on street corners enlarged upon the end of the world, asking\nthat the people prepare for eternity, attributing the Horror to the act\nof a Supreme Being enraged with the wickedness of the Earth.\n\nExpecting every moment an attack by the Horror, people left their work\nand gathered in the streets. Traffic, in places, had been blocked for\nhours and law and order were practically paralyzed. Commerce and\ntransportation were disrupted as fright-ridden people fled from the\nlarger cities, seeking doubtful hiding places in rural districts from\nthe death that stalked the land.\n\nA loudspeaker in front of a music store blared forth the latest news\nflashes.\n\n\"It has been learned,\" came the measured tones of the announcer, \"that\nall communication with Berlin ceased about ten minutes ago. At Paris all\nefforts to hold the Horror at bay have been futile. Explosives blow it\napart, but have the same effect upon it as explosion has on gas. It\nflies apart and then reforms again, not always in the same shape as it\nwas before. A new gas, one of the most deadly ever conceived by man, has\nfailed to have any effect on the things. Electric guns and heat guns\nhave absolutely no effect upon them.\n\n\"A news flash which has just come in from Rome says that a large number\nof the Horrors has been sighted north of that city by airmen. It seems\nthey are attacking the capitals of the world first. Word comes from\nWashington that every known form of defense is being amassed at that\ncity. New York is also preparing....\"\n\nHenry Woods fought his way through the crowd which milled in front of\nthe loudspeaker. The hum of excitement was giving away to a silence, the\nsilence of a stunned people, the fearful silence of a populace facing a\npresence it is unable to understand, an embattled world standing with\nuseless weapons before an incomprehensible enemy.\n\nIn despair the reporter looked about for a taxi, but realized, with a\ngroan of resignation, that no taxi could possibly operate in that\ncrowded street. A street car, blocked by the stream of humanity which\njostled and elbowed about it, stood still, a defeated thing.\n\nSeemingly the only man with a definite purpose in that whirlpool of\nterror-stricken men and women, the newspaperman settled down to the\nserious business of battling his way through the swarming street.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Before I go to the crux of the matter,\" said Dr. Silas White, about\nhalf an hour later, \"let us first review what we know of this so-called\nHorror. Suppose you tell me exactly what you know of it.\"\n\nHenry Woods shifted uneasily in his chair. Why didn't the old fool get\ndown to business? The chief would raise hell if this story didn't make\nthe regular edition. He stole a glance at his wrist-watch. There was\nstill almost an hour left. Maybe he could manage it. If the old chap\nwould only snap into it!\n\n\"I know no more,\" he said, \"than is common knowledge.\"\n\nThe gimlet eyes of the old white-haired scientist regarded the\nnewspaperman sharply.\n\n\"And that is?\" he questioned.\n\nThere was no way out of it, thought Henry. He'd have to humor the old\nfellow.\n\n\"The Horror,\" he replied, \"appeared on Earth, so far as the knowledge of\nman is concerned, about six months ago.\"\n\nDr. White nodded approvingly.\n\n\"You state the facts very aptly,\" he said.\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"When you say 'so far as the knowledge of man is concerned.'\"\n\n\"Why is that?\"\n\n\"You will understand in due time. Please proceed.\"\n\nVaguely the newspaperman wondered whether he was interviewing the\nscientist or the scientist interviewing him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"They were first reported,\" Woods said, \"early this spring. At that time\nthey wiped out a small village in the province of Quebec. All the\ninhabitants, except a few fugitives, were found dead, killed\nmysteriously and half eaten, as if by wild beasts. The fugitives were\ndemented, babbling of black shapes that swept down out of the dark\nforest upon the little town in the small hours of the morning.\n\n\"The next that was heard of them was about a week later, when they\nstruck in an isolated rural district in Poland, killing and feeding on\nthe population of several farms. In the next week more villages were\nwiped out, in practically every country on the face of the Earth. From\nthe hinterlands came tales of murder done at midnight, of men and women\nhorribly mangled, of livestock slaughtered, of buildings crushed as if\nby some titanic force.\n\n\"At first they worked only at night and then, seeming to become bolder\nand more numerous, attacked in broad daylight.\"\n\nThe newspaperman paused.\n\n\"Is that what you want?\" he asked.\n\n\"That's part of it,\" replied Dr. White, \"but that's not all. What do\nthese Horrors look like?\"\n\n\"That's more difficult,\" said Henry. \"They have been reported as every\nconceivable sort of monstrosity. Some are large and others are small.\nSome take the form of animals, others of birds and reptiles, and some\nare cast in appalling shapes such as might be snatched out of the horrid\nimagery of a thing which resided in a world entirely alien to our own.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. White rose from his chair and strode across the room to confront the\nother.\n\n\"Young man,\" he asked, \"do you think it possible the Horror might have\ncome out of a world entirely alien to our own?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Henry. \"I know that some of the scientists\nbelieve they came from some other planet, perhaps even from some other\nsolar system. I know they are like nothing ever known before on Earth.\nThey are always inky black, something like black tar, you know, sort of\nsticky-looking, a disgusting sight. The weapons of mankind can't affect\nthem. Explosives are useless and so are projectiles. They wade through\npoison gas and fiery chemicals and seem to enjoy them. Elaborate\nelectrical barriers have failed. Heat doesn't make them turn a hair.\"\n\n\"And you think they came from some other planet, perhaps some other\nsolar system?\"\n\n\"I don't know what to think,\" said Henry. \"If they came out of space\nthey must have come in some conveyance, and that would certainly have\nbeen sighted, picked up long before it arrived, by our astronomers. If\nthey came in small conveyances, there must have been many of them. If\nthey came in a single conveyance, it would be too large to escape\ndetection. That is, unless--\"\n\n\"Unless what?\" snapped the scientist.\n\n\"Unless it traveled at the speed of light. Then it would have been\ninvisible.\"\n\n\"Not only invisible,\" snorted the old man, \"but non-existent.\"\n\nA question was on the tip of the newspaperman's tongue, but before it\ncould be asked the old man was speaking again, asking a question:\n\n\"Can you imagine a fourth dimension?\"\n\n\"No, I can't,\" said Henry.\n\n\"Can you imagine a thing of only two dimensions?\"\n\n\"Vaguely, yes.\"\n\nThe scientist smote his palms together.\n\n\"Now we're coming to it!\" he exclaimed.\n\nHenry Woods regarded the other narrowly. The old man must be turned.\nWhat did fourth and second dimensions have to do with the Horror?\n\n\"Do you know anything about evolution?\" questioned the old man.\n\n\"I have a slight understanding of it. It is the process of upward\ngrowth, the stairs by which simple organisms climb to become more\ncomplex organisms.\"\n\nDr. White grunted and asked still another question:\n\n\"Do you know anything about the theory of the exploding universe? Have\nyou ever noted the tendency of the perfectly balanced to run amuck?\"\n\nThe reporter rose slowly to his feet.\n\n\"Dr. White,\" he said, \"you phoned my paper you had a story for us. I\ncame here to get it, but all you have done is ask me questions. If you\ncan't tell me what you want us to publish, I will say good-day.\"\n\nThe doctor put forth a hand that shook slightly.\n\n\"Sit down, young man,\" he said. \"I don't blame you for being impatient,\nbut I will now come to my point.\"\n\nThe newspaperman sat down again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I have developed a hypothesis,\" said Dr. White, \"and have conducted\nseveral experiments which seem to bear it out. I am staking my\nreputation upon the supposition that it is correct. Not only that, but I\nam also staking the lives of several brave men who believe implicitly in\nme and my theory. After all, I suppose it makes little difference, for\nif I fail the world is doomed, if I succeed it is saved from complete\ndestruction.\n\n\"Have you ever thought that our evolutionists might be wrong, that\nevolution might be downward instead of upward? The theory of the\nexploding universe, the belief that all of creation is running down,\nbeing thrown off balance by the loss of energy, spurred onward by cosmic\naccidents which tend to disturb its equilibrium, to a time when it will\nrun wild and space will be filled with swirling dust of disintegrated\nworlds, would bear out this contention.\n\n\"This does not apply to the human race. There is no question that our\nevolution is upward, that we have arisen from one-celled creatures\nwallowing in the slime of primal seas. Our case is probably paralleled\nby thousands of other intelligences on far-flung planets and island\nuniverses. These instances, however, running at cross purposes to the\ngeneral evolutional trend of the entire cosmos, are mere flashes in the\neventual course of cosmic evolution, comparing no more to eternity than\na split second does to a million years.\n\n\"Taking these instances, then, as inconsequential, let us say that the\ntrend of cosmic evolution is downward rather than upward, from complex\nunits to simpler units rather than from simple units to more complex\nones.\n\n\"Let us say that life and intelligence have degenerated. How would you\nsay such a degeneration would take place? In just what way would it be\nmanifested? What sort of transition would life pass through in passing\nfrom one stage to a lower one? Just what would be the nature of these\nstages?\"\n\nThe scientist's eyes glowed brightly as he bent forward in his chair.\nThe newspaperman said simply: \"I have no idea.\"\n\n\"Man,\" cried the old man, \"can't you see that it would be a matter of\ndimensions? From the fourth dimension to the third, from the third to\nthe second, from the second to the first, from the first to a\nquestionable existence or plane which is beyond our understanding or\nperhaps to oblivion and the end of life. Might not the fourth have\nevolved from a fifth, the fifth from a sixth, the sixth from a seventh,\nand so on to no one knows what multidimension?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. White paused to allow the other man to grasp the importance of his\nstatements. Woods failed lamentably to do so.\n\n\"But what has this to do with the Horror?\" he asked.\n\n\"Have you absolutely no imagination?\" shouted the old man.\n\n\"Why, I suppose I have, but I seem to fail to understand.\"\n\n\"We are facing an invasion of fourth-dimensional creatures,\" the old man\nwhispered, almost as if fearful to speak the words aloud. \"We are being\nattacked by life which is one dimension above us in evolution. We are\nfighting, I tell you, a tribe of hellhounds out of the cosmos. They are\nunthinkably above us in the matter of intelligence. There is a chasm of\nknowledge between us so wide and so deep that it staggers the\nimagination. They regard us as mere animals, perhaps not even that. So\nfar as they are concerned we are just fodder, something to be eaten as\nwe eat vegetables and cereals or the flesh of domesticated animals.\nPerhaps they have watched us for years, watching life on the world\nincrease, lapping their monstrous jowls over the fattening of the Earth.\nThey have awaited the proper setting of the banquet table and now they\nare dining.\n\n\"Their thoughts are not our thoughts, their ideals not our ideals.\nPerhaps they have nothing in common with us except the primal basis of\nall life, self-preservation, the necessity of feeding.\n\n\"Maybe they have come of their own will. I prefer to believe that they\nhave. Perhaps they are merely following the natural course of events,\nobeying some immutable law legislated by some higher being who watches\nover the cosmos and dictates what shall be and what shall not be. If\nthis is true it means that there has been a flaw in my reasoning, for I\nbelieved that the life of each plane degenerated in company with the\ndegeneration of its plane of existence, which would obey the same\nevolutional laws which govern the life upon it. I am quite satisfied\nthat this invasion is a well-planned campaign, that some\nfourth-dimensional race has found a means of breaking through the veil\nof force which separates its plane from ours.\"\n\n\"But,\" pointed out Henry Woods, \"you say they are fourth-dimensional\nthings. I can't see anything about them to suggest an additional\ndimension. They are plainly three-dimensional.\"\n\n\"Of course they are three-dimensional. They would have to be to live in\nthis world of three dimensions. The only two-dimensional objects which\nwe know of in this world are merely illusions, projections of the third\ndimension, like a shadow. It is impossible for more than one dimension\nto live on any single plane.\n\n\"To attack us they would have to lose one dimension. This they have\nevidently done. You can see how utterly ridiculous it would be for you\nto try to attack a two-dimensional thing. So far as you were concerned\nit would have no mass. The same is true of the other dimensions.\nSimilarly a being of a lesser plane could not harm an inhabitant of a\nhigher plane. It is apparent that while the Horror has lost one material\ndimension, it has retained certain fourth-dimensional properties which\nmake it invulnerable to the forces at the command of our plane.\"\n\nThe newspaperman was now sitting on the edge of his chair.\n\n\"But,\" he asked breathlessly, \"it all sounds so hopeless. What can be\ndone about it?\"\n\nDr. White hitched his chair closer and his fingers closed with a fierce\ngrasp upon the other's knee. A militant boom came into his voice.\n\n\"My boy,\" he said, \"we are to strike back. We are going to invade the\nfourth-dimensional plane of these hellhounds. We are going to make them\nfeel our strength. We are going to strike back.\"\n\nHenry Woods sprang to his feet.\n\n\"How?\" he shouted. \"Have you...?\"\n\nDr. White nodded.\n\n\"I have found a way to send the third-dimensional into the fourth. Come\nand I will show you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe machine was huge, but it had an appearance of simple construction. A\nlarge rectangular block of what appeared to be a strange black metal was\nset on end and flanked on each side by two smaller ones. On the top of\nthe large block was set a half-globe of a strange substance, somewhat,\nHenry thought, like frosted glass. On one side of the large cube was set\na lever, a long glass panel, two vertical tubes and three clock-face\nindicators. The control board, it appeared, was relatively simple.\n\nBeside the mass of the five rectangles, on the floor, was a large plate\nof transparent substance, ground to a concave surface, through which one\ncould see an intricate tangle of wire mesh.\n\nHanging from the ceiling, directly above the one on the floor, was\nanother concave disk, but this one had a far more pronounced curvature.\n\nWires connected the two disks and each in turn was connected to the\nrectangular machine.\n\n\"It is a matter of the proper utilization of two forces, electrical and\ngravitational,\" proudly explained Dr. White. \"Those two forces, properly\nused, warp the third-dimensional into the fourth. A reverse process is\nused to return the object to the third. The principle of the machine\nis--\"\n\nThe old man was about to launch into a lengthy discussion, but Henry\ninterrupted him. A glance at his watch had shown him press time was\ndrawing perilously close.\n\n\"Just a second,\" he said. \"You propose to warp a third-dimensional being\ninto a fourth dimension. How can a third-dimensional thing exist there?\nYou said a short time ago that only a specified dimension could exist on\none single plane.\"\n\n\"You have missed my point,\" snapped Dr. White. \"I am not sending a\nthird-dimensional thing to a fourth dimension. I am changing the\nthird-dimensional being into a fourth-dimensional being. I add a\ndimension, and automatically the being exists on a different plane. I am\nreversing evolution. This third dimension we now exist on evolved,\nmillions of eons ago, from a fourth dimension. I am sending a lesser\nentity back over those millions of eons to a plane similar to one upon\nwhich his ancestors lived inconceivably long ago.\"\n\n\"But, man, how do you know you can do it?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe doctor's eyes gleamed and his fingers reached out to press a bell.\n\nA servant appeared almost at once.\n\n\"Bring me a dog,\" snapped the old man. The servant disappeared.\n\n\"Young man,\" said Dr. White, \"I am going to show you how I know I can do\nit. I have done it before, now I am going to do it for you. I have sent\ndogs and cats back to the fourth dimension and returned them safely to\nthis room. I can do the same with men.\"\n\nThe servant reappeared, carrying in his arms a small dog. The doctor\nstepped to the control board of his strange machine.\n\n\"All right, George,\" he said.\n\nThe servant had evidently worked with the old man enough to know what\nwas expected of him. He stepped close to the floor disk and waited. The\ndog whined softly, sensing that all was not exactly right.\n\nThe old scientist slowly shoved the lever toward the right, and as he\ndid so a faint hum filled the room, rising to a stupendous roar as he\nadvanced the lever. From both floor disk and upper disk leaped strange\ncones of blue light, which met midway to form an hour-glass shape of\nbrilliance.\n\nThe light did not waver or sparkle. It did not glow. It seemed hard and\nbrittle, like straight bars of force. The newspaperman, gazing with awe\nupon it, felt that terrific force was there. What had the old man said?\nWarp a third-dimensional being into another dimension! That would take\nforce!\n\nAs he watched, petrified by the spectacle, the servant stepped forward\nand, with a flip, tossed the little dog into the blue light. The animal\ncould be discerned for a moment through the light and then it\ndisappeared.\n\n\"Look in the globe!\" shouted the old man; and Henry jerked his eyes from\nthe column of light to the half-globe atop the machine.\n\nHe gasped. In the globe, deep within its milky center, glowed a picture\nthat made his brain reel as he looked upon it. It was a scene such as no\nman could have imagined unaided. It was a horribly distorted projection\nof an eccentric landscape, a landscape hardly analogous to anything on\nEarth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"That's the fourth dimension, sir,\" said the servant.\n\n\"That's not the fourth dimension,\" the old man corrected him. \"That's a\nthird-dimensional impression of the fourth dimension. It is no more the\nfourth dimension than a shadow is three-dimensional. It, like a shadow,\nis merely a projection. It gives us a glimpse of what the fourth plane\nis like. It is a shadow of that plane.\"\n\nSlowly a dark blotch began to grow in the landscape. Slowly it assumed\ndefinite form. It puzzled the reporter. It looked familiar. He could\nhave sworn he had seen it somewhere before. It was alive, for it had\nmoved.\n\n\"That, sir, is the dog,\" George volunteered.\n\n\"That was the dog,\" Dr. White again corrected him. \"God knows what it is\nnow.\"\n\nHe turned to the newspaperman.\n\n\"Have you seen enough?\" he demanded.\n\nHenry nodded.\n\nThe other slowly began to return the lever to its original position.\nThe roaring subsided, the light faded, the projection in the half-globe\ngrew fainter.\n\n\"How are you going to use it?\" asked the newspaperman.\n\n\"I have ninety-eight men who have agreed to be projected into the fourth\ndimension to seek out the entities that are attacking us and attack them\nin turn. I shall send them out in an hour.\"\n\n\"Where is there a phone?\" asked the newspaperman.\n\n\"In the next room,\" replied Dr. White.\n\nAs the reporter dashed out of the door, the light faded entirely from\nbetween the two disks and on the lower one a little dog crouched,\nquivering, softly whimpering.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe old man stepped from the controls and approached the disk. He\nscooped the little animal from where it lay into his arms and patted the\nsilky head.\n\n\"Good dog,\" he murmured; and the creature snuggled close to him,\ncomforted, already forgetting that horrible place from which it had just\nreturned.\n\n\"Is everything ready, George?\" asked the old man.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied the servant. \"The men are all ready, even anxious to\ngo. If you ask me, sir, they are a tough lot.\"\n\n\"They are as brave a group of men as ever graced the Earth,\" replied the\nscientist gently. \"They are adventurers, every one of whom has faced\ndanger and will not shrink from it. They are born fighters. My one\nregret is that I have not been able to secure more like them. A thousand\nmen such as they should be able to conquer any opponent. It was\nimpossible. The others were poor soft fools. They laughed in my face.\nThey thought I was an old fool--I, the man who alone stands between them\nand utter destruction.\"\n\nHis voice had risen to almost a scream, but it again sank to a normal\ntone.\n\n\"I may be sending ninety-eight brave men to instant death. I hope not.\"\n\n\"You can always jerk them back, sir,\" suggested George.\n\n\"Maybe I can, maybe not,\" murmured the old man.\n\nHenry Woods appeared in the doorway.\n\n\"When do we start?\" he asked.\n\n\"We?\" exclaimed the scientist.\n\n\"Certainly, you don't believe you're going to leave me out of this. Why,\nman, it's the greatest story of all time. I'm going as special war\ncorrespondent.\"\n\n\"They believed it? They are going to publish it?\" cried the old man,\nclutching at the newspaperman's sleeve.\n\n\"Well, the editor was skeptical at first, but after I swore on all sorts\nof oaths it was true, he ate it up. Maybe you think that story didn't\nstop the presses!\"\n\n\"I didn't expect them to. I just took a chance. I thought they, too,\nwould laugh at me.\"\n\n\"But when do we start?\" persisted Henry.\n\n\"You are really in earnest? You really want to go?\" asked the old man,\nunbelievingly.\n\n\"I am going. Try to stop me.\"\n\nDr. White glanced at his watch.\n\n\"We will start in exactly thirty-four minutes,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Ten seconds to go.\" George, standing with watch in hand, spoke in a\nprecise manner, the very crispness of his words betraying the excitement\nunder which he labored.\n\nThe blue light, hissing, drove from disk to disk; the room thundered\nwith the roar of the machine, before which stood Dr. White, his hand on\nthe lever, his eyes glued on the instruments before him.\n\nIn a line stood the men who were to fling themselves into the light to\nbe warped into another dimension, there to seek out and fight an unknown\nenemy. The line was headed by a tall man with hands like hams, with a\nweather-beaten face and a wild mop of hair. Behind him stood a\nbelligerent little cockney. Henry Woods stood fifth in line. They were a\nmotley lot, adventurers every one of them, and some were obviously\nafraid as they stood before that column of light, with only a few\nseconds of the third dimension left to them. They had answered a weird\nadvertisement, and had but a limited idea of what they were about to do.\nGrimly, though, they accepted it as a job, a bizarre job, but a job.\nThey faced it as they had faced other equally dangerous, but less\nunusual, jobs.\n\n\"Five seconds,\" snapped George.\n\nThe lever was all the way over now. The half-globe showed, within its\nmilky interior, a hideously distorted landscape. The light had taken on\na hard, brittle appearance and its hiss had risen to a scream. The\nmachine thundered steadily with a suggestion of horrible power.\n\n\"Time up!\"\n\nThe tall man stepped forward. His foot reached the disk; another step\nand he was bathed in the light, a third and he glimmered momentarily,\nthen vanished. Close on his heels followed the little cockney.\n\nWith his nerves at almost a snapping point, Henry moved on behind the\nfourth man. He was horribly afraid, he wanted to break from the line and\nrun, it didn't matter where, any place to get away from that steady,\nsteely light in front of him. He had seen three men step into it, glow\nfor a second, and then disappear. A fourth man had placed his foot on\nthe disk.\n\nCold sweat stood out on his brow. Like an automaton he placed one foot\non the disk. The fourth man had already disappeared.\n\n\"Snap into it, pal,\" growled the man behind.\n\nHenry lifted the other foot, caught his toe on the edge of the disk and\nstumbled headlong into the column of light.\n\nHe was conscious of intense heat which was instantly followed by equally\nintense cold. For a moment his body seemed to be under enormous\npressure, then it seemed to be expanding, flying apart, bursting,\nexploding....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe felt solid ground under his feet, and his eyes, snapping open, saw an\nalien land. It was a land of somber color, with great gray moors, and\nbeetling black cliffs. There was something queer about it, an intangible\nquality that baffled him.\n\nHe looked about him, expecting to see his companions. He saw no one. He\nwas absolutely alone in that desolate brooding land. Something dreadful\nhad happened! Was he the only one to be safely transported from the\nthird dimension? Had some horrible accident occurred? Was he alone?\n\nSudden panic seized him. If something had happened, if the others were\nnot here, might it not be possible that the machine would not be able to\nbring him back to his own dimension? Was he doomed to remain marooned\nforever in this terrible plane?\n\nHe looked down at his body and gasped in dismay. It was not his body!\n\nIt was a grotesque caricature of a body, a horrible profane mass of\nflesh, like a phantasmagoric beast snatched from the dreams of a\nlunatic.\n\nIt was real, however. He felt it with his hands, but they were not\nhands. They were something like hands; they served the same purpose\nthat hands served in the third dimension. He was, he realized, a being\nof the fourth dimension, but in his fourth-dimensional brain still clung\nhard-fighting remnants of that faithful old third-dimensional brain. He\ncould not, as yet, see with fourth-dimensional eyes, think purely\nfourth-dimensional thoughts. He had not oriented himself as yet to this\nnew plane of existence. He was seeing the fourth dimension through the\nblurred lenses of millions of eons of third-dimensional existence. He\nwas seeing it much more clearly than he had seen it in the half-globe\natop the machine in Dr. White's laboratory, but he would not see it\nclearly until every vestige of the third dimension was wiped from him.\nThat, he knew, would come in time.\n\nHe felt his weird body with those things that served as hands, and he\nfound, beneath his groping, unearthly fingers, great rolling muscles,\npowerful tendons, and hard, well-conditioned flesh. A sense of\nwell-being surged through him and he growled like an animal, like an\nanimal of that horrible fourth plane.\n\nBut the terrible sounds that came from between his slobbering lips were\nnot those of his own voice, they were the voices of many men.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen he knew. He was not alone. Here, in this one body were the bodies,\nthe brains, the power, the spirit, of those other ninety-eight men. In\nthe fourth dimension, all the millions of third-dimensional things were\none. Perhaps that particular portion of the third dimension called the\nEarth had sprung from, or degenerated from, one single unit of a\ndissolving, worn-out fourth dimension. The third dimension, warped back\nto a higher plane, was automatically obeying the mystic laws of\nevolution by reforming in the shape of that old ancestor, unimaginably\nremoved in time from the race he had begot. He was no longer Henry\nWoods, newspaperman; he was an entity that had given birth, in the dim\nages when the Earth was born, to a third dimension. Nor was he alone.\nThis body of his was composed of other sons of that ancient entity.\n\nHe felt himself grow, felt his body grow vaster, assume greater\nproportions, felt new vitality flow through him. It was the other men,\nthe men who were flinging themselves into the column of light in the\nlaboratory to be warped back to this plane, to be incorporated in his\nbody.\n\nIt was not his body, however. His brain was not his alone. The pronoun,\nhe realized, represented the sum total of those other men, his fellow\nadventurers.\n\nSuddenly a new feeling came, a feeling of completeness, a feeling of\nsupreme fitness. He knew that the last of the ninety-eight men had\nstepped across the disk, that all were here in this giant body.\n\nNow he could see more clearly. Things in the landscape, which had\nescaped him before, became recognizable. Awful thoughts ran through his\nbrain, heavy, ponderous, black thoughts. He began to recognize the\nlandscape as something familiar, something he had seen before, a thing\nwith which he was intimate. Phenomena, which his third-dimensional\nintelligence would have gasped at, became commonplace. He was finally\nseeing through fourth-dimensional eyes, thinking fourth-dimensional\nthoughts.\n\nMemory seeped into his brain and he had fleeting visions, visions of\ndark caverns lit by hellish flames, of huge seas that battered\nremorselessly with mile-high waves against towering headlands that\nreared titanic toward a glowering sky. He remembered a red desert\nscattered with scarlet boulders, he remembered silver cliffs of\ngleaming metallic stone. Through all his thoughts ran something else, a\nscarlet thread of hate, an all-consuming passion, a fierce lust after\nthe life of some other entity.\n\nHe was no longer a composite thing built of third-dimensional beings. He\nwas a creature of another plane, a creature with a consuming hate, and\nsuddenly he knew against whom this hate was directed and why. He knew\nalso that this creature was near and his great fists closed and then\nspread wide as he knew it. How did he know it? Perhaps through some\nsense which he, as a being of another plane, held, but which was alien\nto the Earth. Later, he asked himself this question. At the time,\nhowever, there was no questioning on his part. He only knew that\nsomewhere near was a hated enemy and he did not question the source of\nhis knowledge....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMumbling in an idiom incomprehensible to a third-dimensional being,\nfilled with rage that wove redly through his brain, he lumbered down the\nhill onto the moor, his great strides eating up the distance, his\nfootsteps shaking the ground.\n\nAt the foot of the hill he halted and from his throat issued a\nchallenging roar that made the very crags surrounding the moor tremble.\nThe rocks flung back the roar as if in mockery.\n\nAgain he shouted and in the shout he framed a lurid insult to the enemy\nthat lurked there in the cliffs.\n\nAgain the crags flung back the insult, but this time the echoes, booming\nover the moor, were drowned by another voice, the voice of the enemy.\n\nAt the far end of the moor appeared a gigantic form, a form that\nshambled on grotesque, misshapen feet, growling angrily as he came.\n\nHe came rapidly despite his clumsy gait, and as he came he mouthed\nterrific threats.\n\nClose to the other he halted and only then did recognition dawn in his\neyes.\n\n\"_You, Mal Shaff?_\" he growled in his guttural tongue, and surprise and\nconsternation were written large upon his ugly face.\n\n\"Yes, it is I, Mal Shaff,\" boomed the other. \"Remember, Ouglat, the day\nyou destroyed me and my plane. I have returned to wreak my vengeance. I\nhave solved a mystery you have never guessed and I have come back. You\ndid not imagine you were attacking me again when you sent your minions\nto that other plane to feed upon the beings there. It was I you were\nattacking, fool, and I am here to kill you.\"\n\nOuglat leaped and the thing that had been Henry Woods, newspaperman, and\nninety-eight other men, but was now Mal Shaff of the fourth dimension,\nleaped to meet him.\n\nMal Shaff felt the force of Ouglat, felt the sharp pain of a hammering\nfist, and lashed out with those horrible arms of his to smash at the\nleering face of his antagonist. He felt his fists strike solid flesh,\nfelt the bones creak and tremble beneath his blow.\n\nHis nostrils were filled with the terrible stench of the other's foul\nbreath and his filthy body. He teetered on his gnarled legs and\nside-stepped a vicious kick and then stepped in to gouge with\nstraightened thumb at the other's eye. The thumb went true and Ouglat\nhowled in pain.\n\nMal Shaff leaped back as his opponent charged head down, and his knotted\nfist beat a thunderous tattoo as the misshapen beast closed in. He felt\nclawing fingers seeking his throat, felt ghastly nails ripping at his\nshoulders. In desperation he struck blindly, and Ouglat reeled away.\nWith a quick stride he shortened the distance between them and struck\nOuglat a hard blow squarely on his slavering mouth. Pressing hard upon\nthe reeling figure, he swung his fists like sledge-hammers, and Ouglat\nstumbled, falling in a heap on the sand.\n\nMal Shaff leaped upon the fallen foe and kicked him with his taloned\nfeet, ripping him wickedly. There was no thought of fair play, no\nfaintest glimmer of mercy. This was a battle to the death: there could\nbe no quarter.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe fallen monster howled, but his voice cut short as his foul mouth,\nwith its razor-edged fangs, closed on the other's body. His talons,\nseeking a hold, clawed deep.\n\nMal Shaff, his brain a screaming maelstrom of weird emotions, aimed\npile-driver blows at the enemy, clawed and ripped. Together the two\nrolled, locked tight in titanic battle, on the sandy plain and a great\ncloud of heavy dust marked where they struggled.\n\nIn desperation Ouglat put every ounce of his strength into a heave that\nbroke the other's grip and flung him away.\n\nThe two monstrosities surged to their feet, their eyes red with hate,\nglaring through the dust cloud at one another.\n\nSlowly Ouglat's hand stole to a black, wicked cylinder that hung on a\nbelt at his waist. His fingers closed upon it and he drew the weapon. As\nhe leveled it at Mal Shaff, his lips curled back and his features\ndistorted into something that was not pleasant to see.\n\nMal Shaff, with doubled fists, saw the great thumb of his enemy slowly\ndepressing a button on the cylinder, and a great fear held him rooted\nin his tracks. In the back of his brain something was vainly trying to\nexplain to him the horror of this thing which the other held.\n\nThen a multicolored spiral, like a corkscrew column of vapor, sprang\nfrom the cylinder and flashed toward him. It struck him full on the\nchest and even as it did so he caught the ugly fire of triumph in the\nred eyes of his enemy.\n\nHe felt a stinging sensation where the spiral struck, but that was all.\nHe was astounded. He had feared this weapon, had been sure it portended\nsome form of horrible death. But all it did was to produce a slight\nsting.\n\nFor a split second he stood stock-still, then he surged forward and\nadvanced upon Ouglat, his hands outspread like claws. From his throat\ncame those horrible sounds, the speech of the fourth dimension.\n\n\"Did I not tell you, foul son of Sargouthe, that I had solved a mystery\nyou have never guessed at? Although you destroyed me long ago, I have\nreturned. Throw away your puny weapon. I am of the lower dimension and\nam invulnerable to your engines of destruction. You bloated....\" His\nwords trailed off into a stream of vileness that could never have\noccurred to a third-dimensional mind.\n\nOuglat, with every line of his face distorted with fear, flung the\nweapon from him, and turning, fled clumsily down the moor, with Mal\nShaff at his heels.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSteadily Mal Shaff gained and with only a few feet separating him from\nOuglat, he dived with outspread arms at the other's legs.\n\nThe two came down together, but Mal Shaff's grip was broken by the fall\nand the two regained their feet at almost the same instant.\n\nThe wild moor resounded to their throaty roaring and the high cliffs\nflung back the echoes of the bellowing of the two gladiators below. It\nwas sheer strength now and flesh and bone were bruised and broken under\nthe life-shaking blows that they dealt. Great furrows were plowed in the\nsand by the sliding of heavy feet as the two fighters shifted to or away\nfrom attack. Blood, blood of fourth-dimensional creatures, covered the\nbodies of the two and stained the sand with its horrible hue.\nPerspiration streamed from them and their breath came in gulping gasps.\n\nThe lurid sun slid across the purple sky and still the two fought on.\nOuglat, one of the ancients, and Mal Shaff, reincarnated. It was a\nbattle of giants, a battle that must have beggared even the titanic\ntilting of forgotten gods and entities in the ages when the\nthird-dimensional Earth was young.\n\nMal Shaff had no conception of time. He may have fought seconds or\nhours. It seemed an eternity. He had attempted to fight scientifically,\nbut had failed to do so. While one part of him had cried out to elude\nhis opponent, to wait for openings, to conserve his strength, another\npart had shouted at him to step in and smash, smash, smash at the hated\nmonstrosity pitted against him.\n\nIt seemed Ouglat was growing in size, had become more agile, that his\nstrength was greater. His punches hurt more; it was harder to hit him.\n\nStill Mal Shaff drilled in determinedly, head down, fists working like\npistons. As the other seemed to grow stronger and larger, he seemed to\nbecome smaller and weaker.\n\nIt was queer. Ouglat should be tired, too. His punches should be weaker.\nHe should move more slowly, be heavier on his feet.\n\nThere was no doubt of it. Ouglat was growing larger, was drawing on\nsome mysterious reserve of strength. From somewhere new force and life\nwere flowing into his body. But from where was this strength coming?\n\nA huge fist smashed against Mal Shaff's jaw. He felt himself lifted, and\nthe next moment he skidded across the sand.\n\nLying there, gasping for breath, almost too fagged to rise, with the\nblack bulk of the enemy looming through the dust cloud before him, he\nsuddenly realized the source of the other's renewed strength.\n\nOuglat was recalling his minions from the third dimension! They were\nincorporating in his body, returning to their parent body!\n\nThey were coming back from the third dimension to the fourth dimension\nto fight a third-dimensional thing reincarnated in the fourth-dimensional\nform it had lost millions of eons ago!\n\nThis was the end, thought Mal Shaff. But he staggered to his feet to\nmeet the charge of the ancient enemy and a grim song, a death chant\nimmeasurably old, suddenly and dimly remembered from out of the mists of\ncountless millenniums, was on his lips as he swung a pile-driver blow\ninto the suddenly astonished face of the rushing Ouglat....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe milky globe atop the machine in Dr. White's laboratory glowed\nsoftly, and within that glow two figures seemed to struggle.\n\nBefore the machine, his hands still on the controls, stood Dr. Silas\nWhite. Behind him the room was crowded with newspapermen and\nphotographers.\n\nHours had passed since the ninety-eight men--ninety-nine, counting Henry\nWoods--had stepped into the brittle column of light to be shunted back\nthrough unguessed time to a different plane of existence. The old\nscientist, during all those hours, had stood like a graven image before\nhis machine, eyes staring fixedly at the globe.\n\nThrough the open windows he had heard the cry of the newsboy as the\n_Press_ put the greatest scoop of all time on the street. The phone had\nrung like mad and George answered it. The doorbell buzzed repeatedly and\nGeorge ushered in newspapermen who had asked innumerable questions, to\nwhich he had replied briefly, almost mechanically. The reporters had\nfought for the use of the one phone in the house and had finally drawn\nlots for it. A few had raced out to use other phones.\n\nPhotographers came and flashes popped and cameras clicked. The room was\nin an uproar. On the rare occasions when the reporters were not using\nthe phone the instrument buzzed shrilly. Authoritative voices demanded\nDr. Silas White. George, his eyes on the old man, stated that Dr. Silas\nWhite could not be disturbed, that he was busy.\n\nFrom the street below came the heavy-throated hum of thousands of\nvoices. The street was packed with a jostling crowd of awed humanity,\nevery eye fastened on the house of Dr. Silas White. Lines of police held\nthem back.\n\n\"What makes them move so slowly?\" asked a reporter, staring at the\nglobe. \"They hardly seem to be moving. It looks like a slow motion\npicture.\"\n\n\"They are not moving slowly,\" replied Dr. White. \"There must be a\ndifference in time in the fourth dimension. Maybe what is hours to us is\nonly seconds to them. Time must flow more slowly there. Perhaps it is a\nbigger place than this third plane. That may account for it. They aren't\nmoving slowly, they are fighting savagely. It's a fight to the death!\nWatch!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe grotesque arm of one of the figures in the milky globe was moving\nout slowly, loafing along, aimed at the head of the other. Slowly the\nother twisted his body aside, but too slowly. The fist finally touched\nthe head, still moving slowly forward, the body following as slowly. The\nhead of the creature twisted, bent backward, and the body toppled back\nin a leisurely manner.\n\n\"What does White say?... Can't you get a statement of some sort from\nhim? Won't he talk at all? A hell of a fine reporter you are--can't even\nget a man to open his mouth. Ask him about Henry Woods. Get a\nhuman-interest slant on Woods walking into the light. Ask him how long\nthis is going to last. Damn it all, man, do something, and don't bother\nme again until you have a real story--yes, I said a real story--are you\nhard of hearing? For God's sake, do something!\"\n\nThe editor slammed the receiver on the hook.\n\n\"Brooks,\" he snapped, \"get the War Department at Washington. Ask them if\nthey're going to back up White. Go on, go on. Get busy.... How will you\nget them? I don't know. Just get them, that's all. Get them!\"\n\nTypewriters gibbered like chuckling morons through the roaring tumult of\nthe editorial rooms. Copy boys rushed about, white sheets clutched in\ntheir grimy hands. Telephones jangled and strident voices blared through\nthe haze that arose from the pipes and cigarettes of perspiring writers\nwho feverishly transferred to paper the startling events that were\nrocking the world.\n\nThe editor, his necktie off, his shirt open, his sleeves rolled to the\nelbow, drummed his fingers on the desk. It had been a hectic twenty-four\nhours and he had stayed at the desk every minute of the time. He was\ndead tired. When the moment of relaxation came, when the tension\nsnapped, he knew he would fall into an exhausted stupor of sleep, but\nthe excitement was keeping him on his feet. There was work to do. There\nwas news such as the world had never known before. Each new story meant\na new front make-up, another extra. Even now the presses were\nthundering, even now papers with the ink hardly dry upon them were being\nsnatched by the avid public from the hands of screaming newsboys.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA man raced toward the city desk, waving a sheet of paper in his hand.\nSensing something unusual the others in the room crowded about as he\nlaid the sheet before the editor.\n\n\"Just came in,\" the man gasped.\n\nThe paper was a wire dispatch. It read:\n\n    \"Rome--The Black Horror is in full retreat. Although still\n    apparently immune to the weapons being used against it, it is\n    lifting the siege of this city. The cause is unknown.\"\n\nThe editor ran his eye down the sheet. There was another dateline:\n\n    \"Madrid--The Black Horror, which has enclosed this city in a ring of\n    dark terror for the last two days, is fleeing, rapidly\n    disappearing....\"\n\nThe editor pressed a button. There was an answering buzz.\n\n\"Composing room,\" he shouted, \"get ready for a new front! Yes, another\nextra. This will knock their eyes out!\"\n\nA telephone jangled furiously. The editor seized it.\n\n\"Yes. What was that?... White says he must have help. I see. Woods and\nthe others are weakening. Being badly beaten, eh?... More men needed to\ngo out to the other plane. Wants reinforcements. Yes. I see. Well, tell\nhim that he'll have them. If he can wait half an hour we'll have them\nwalking by thousands into that light. I'll be damned if we won't! Just\ntell White to hang on! We'll have the whole nation coming to the\nrescue!\"\n\nHe jabbed up the receiver.\n\n\"Richards,\" he said, \"write a streamer, 'Help Needed,' 'Reinforcements\nCalled'--something of that sort, you know. Make it scream. Tell the\nforeman to dig out the biggest type he has. A foot high. If we ever\nneeded big type, we need it now!\"\n\nHe turned to the telephone.\n\n\"Operator,\" he said, \"get me the Secretary of War at Washington. The\nsecretary in person, you understand. No one else will do.\"\n\nHe turned again to the reporters who stood about the desk.\n\n\"In two hours,\" he explained, banging the desk top for emphasis, \"we'll\nhave the United States Army marching into that light Woods walked into!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe bloody sun was touching the edge of the weird world, seeming to\nhesitate before taking the final plunge behind the towering black crags\nthat hung above the ink-pot shadows at their base. The purple sky had\ndarkened until it was almost the color of soft, black velvet. Great\nstars were blazing out.\n\nOuglat loomed large in the gathering twilight, a horrible misshapen ogre\nof an outer world. He had grown taller, broader, greater. Mal Shaff's\nhead now was on a level with the other's chest; his huge arms seemed\ntoylike in comparison with those of Ouglat, his legs mere pipestems.\n\nTime and time again he had barely escaped as the clutching hands of\nOuglat reached out to grasp him. Once within those hands he would be\ntorn apart.\n\nThe battle had become a game of hide and seek, a game of cat and mouse,\nwith Mal Shaff the mouse.\n\nSlowly the sun sank and the world became darker. His brain working\nfeverishly, Mal Shaff waited for the darkness. Adroitly he worked the\nbattle nearer and nearer to the Stygian darkness that lay at the foot of\nthe mighty crags. In the darkness he might escape. He could no longer\ncontinue this unequal fight. Only escape was left.\n\nThe sun was gone now. Blackness was dropping swiftly over the land, like\na great blanket, creating the illusion of the glowering sky descending\nto the ground. Only a few feet away lay the total blackness under the\ncliffs.\n\nLike a flash Mal Shaff darted into the blackness, was completely\nswallowed in it. Roaring, Ouglat followed.\n\nHis shoulders almost touching the great rock wall that shot straight up\nhundreds of feet above him, Mal Shaff ran swiftly, fear lending speed to\nhis shivering legs. Behind him he heard the bellowing of his enemy.\nOuglat was searching for him, a hopeless search in that total darkness.\nHe would never find him. Mal Shaff felt sure.\n\nFagged and out of breath, he dropped panting at the foot of the wall.\nBlood pounded through his head and his strength seemed to be gone. He\nlay still and stared out into the less dark moor that stretched before\nhim.\n\nFor some time he lay there, resting. Aimlessly he looked out over the\nmoor, and then he suddenly noted, some distance to his right, a hill\nrising from the moor. The hill was vaguely familiar. He remembered it\ndimly as being of great importance.\n\nA sudden inexplicable restlessness filled him. Far behind him he heard\nthe enraged bellowing of Ouglat, but that he scarcely noticed. So long\nas darkness lay upon the land he knew he was safe from his enemy.\n\nThe hill had made him restless. He must reach the top. He could think of\nno logical reason for doing so. Obviously he was safer here at the base\nof the cliff, but a voice seemed to be calling, a friendly voice from\nthe hilltop.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe rose on aching legs and forged ahead. Every fiber of his being cried\nout in protest, but resolutely he placed one foot ahead of the other,\nwalking mechanically.\n\nOpposite the hill he disregarded the strange call that pulsed down upon\nhim, long enough to rest his tortured body. He must build up his\nstrength for the climb.\n\nHe realized that danger lay ahead. Once he quitted the blackness of the\ncliff's base, Ouglat, even in the darkness that lay over the land, might\nsee him. That would be disastrous. Once over the top of the hill he\nwould be safe.\n\nSuddenly the landscape was bathed in light, a soft green radiance. One\nmoment it had been pitch dark, the next it was light, as if a giant\nsearch-light had been snapped on.\n\nIn terror, Mal Shaff looked for the source of the light. Just above the\nhorizon hung a great green orb, which moved up the ladder of the sky\neven as he watched.\n\nA moon! A huge green satellite hurtling swiftly around this cursed\nworld!\n\nA great, overwhelming fear sat upon Mal Shaff and with a high, shrill\nscream of anger he raced forward, forgetful of aching body and outraged\nlungs.\n\nHis scream was answered from far off, and out of the shadows of the\ncliffs toward the far end of the moor a black figure hurled itself.\nOuglat was on the trail!\n\nMal Shaff tore madly up the slope, topped the crest, and threw himself\nflat on the ground, almost exhausted.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA queer feeling stole over him, a queer feeling of well-being. New\nstrength was flowing into him, the old thrill of battle was pounding\nthrough his blood once more.\n\nNot only were queer things happening to his body, but also to his brain.\nThe world about him looked queer, held a sort of an intangible mystery\nhe could not understand. A half question formed in the back of his\nbrain. Who and what was he? Queer thoughts to be thinking! He was Mal\nShaff, but had he always been Mal Shaff?\n\nHe remembered a brittle column of light, creatures with bodies unlike\nhis body, walking into it. He had been one of those creatures. There was\nsomething about dimensions, about different planes, a plan for one plane\nto attack another!\n\nHe scrambled to his bowed legs and beat his great chest with mighty,\nlong-nailed hands. He flung back his head and from his throat broke a\nsound to curdle the blood of even the bravest.\n\nOn the moor below Ouglat heard the cry and answered it with one equally\nferocious.\n\nMal Shaff took a step forward, then stopped stock-still. Through his\nbrain went a sharp command to return to the spot where he had stood, to\nwait there until attacked. He stepped back, shifting his feet\nimpatiently.\n\nHe was growing larger; every second fresh vitality was pouring into him.\nBefore his eyes danced a red curtain of hate and his tongue roared forth\na series of insulting challenges to the figure that was even now\napproaching the foot of the hill.\n\nAs Ouglat climbed the hill, the night became an insane bedlam. The\nchallenging roars beat like surf against the black cliffs.\n\nOuglat's lips were flecked with foam, his red eyes were mere slits, his\nmouth worked convulsively.\n\nThey were only a few feet apart when Ouglat charged.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMal Shaff was ready for him. There was no longer any difference in their\nsize and they met like the two forward walls of contending football\nteams.\n\nMal Shaff felt the soft throat of the other under his fingers and his\ngrip tightened. Maddened, Ouglat shot terrific blow after terrific blow\ninto Mal Shaff's body.\n\nTry as he might, however, he could not shake the other's grip.\n\nIt was silent now. The night seemed brooding, watching the struggle on\nthe hilltop.\n\nLarger and larger grew Mal Shaff, until he overtopped Ouglat like a\ngiant.\n\nThen he loosened his grip and, as Ouglat tried to scuttle away, reached\ndown to grasp him by the nape of his neck.\n\nHigh above his head he lifted his enemy and dashed him to the ground.\nWith a leap he was on the prostrate figure, trampling it apart, smashing\nit into the ground. With wild cries he stamped the earth, treading out\nthe last of Ouglat, the Black Horror.\n\nWhen no trace of the thing that had been Ouglat remained, he moved away\nand viewed the trampled ground.\n\nThen, for the first time he noticed that the crest of the hill was\ncrowded with other monstrous figures. He glared at them, half in\nsurprise, half in anger. He had not noticed their silent approach.\n\n\"It is Mal Shaff!\" cried one.\n\n\"Yes, I am Mal Shaff. What do you want?\"\n\n\"But, Mal Shaff, Ouglat destroyed you once long ago!\"\n\n\"And I, just now,\" replied Mal Shaff, \"have destroyed Ouglat.\"\n\nThe figures were silent, shifting uneasily. Then one stepped forward.\n\n\"Mal Shaff,\" it said, \"we thought you were dead. Apparently it was not\nso. We welcome you to our land again. Ouglat, who once tried to kill you\nand apparently failed, you have killed, which is right and proper. Come\nand live with us again in peace. We welcome you.\"\n\nMal Shaff bowed.\n\nGone was all thought of the third dimension. Through Mal Shaff's mind\nraced strange, haunting memories of a red desert scattered with scarlet\nboulders, of silver cliffs of gleaming metallic stone, of huge seas\nbattering against towering headlands. There were other things, too.\nGreat palaces of shining jewels, and weird nights of inhuman joy where\nhellish flames lit deep, black caverns.\n\nHe bowed again.\n\n\"I thank you, Bathazar,\" he said.\n\nWithout a backward look he shambled down the hill with the others.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Yes?\" said the editor. \"What's that you say? Doctor White is dead! A\nsuicide! Yeah, I understand. Worry, hey! Here, Roberts, take this\nstory.\"\n\nHe handed over the phone.\n\n\"When you write it,\" he said, \"play up the fact he was worried about not\nbeing able to bring the men back to the third dimension.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
