STUART\n\n                         Illustrated by RITTER\n\n           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n                      Galaxy Magazine April 1962.\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\n\n\n\n               She was a wonderful wife--sweet, pretty,\n                loving--but she would keep littering up\n                the house with her old, used-up bodies!\n\n\nI\n\nSo help me, I'm not really a fiend, a monstrous murderer or a\nBluebeard. I am not, truly, even a mad scientist bucking for a billing\nto top Frankenstein's. My knowledge of science ends with the Sunday\nmagazine section of the paper. As for the bodies of all those women the\nfront pages claim I butchered and buried somewhat carelessly out by the\ngarage, all that is just--well, just an illusion of sorts.\n\nEqually illusory, I am hoping, is my reservation for a sure seat, next\nperformance, in the electric chair which now seems so certain after the\nmerest formality of a trial.\n\nActually I am, or was, nothing but a very normal, average--upper middle\naverage, that is--sort of a guy. I have always been friendly, sociable,\nkindly, lovable to a fault. So how did lovable, kindly old I happen to\nget into such a bloody mess?\n\nI simply helped a little old lady cross the street. That's all.\n\nAll right, I admit I was old for Boy Scout work. But the poor old bat\ndid look mighty confused and baffled, standing there on the corner of\nYork and Grand Avenue, looking vaguely around.\n\nSo, \"What the hell,\" I said to myself; and, to her, \"Can I help you,\nMadam?\" I had to cross the street anyway. Traffic being what it was, I\nfigured I'd feel a little safer with her for company. It was silly, of\ncourse, to think that a poor old lady on my arm would ever inhibit the\nGrand Avenue throughway traffic but I tried it. Good job I did, too.\n\nIt was an early fall afternoon, a bit before rush hour. I had knocked\noff work early. It was too nice a day for work and besides the managing\neditor had fired me again. I had nothing better to do, so I thought I'd\nwander over to Maxim's for a drink or two. Then, on the corner, I found\nthe old lady.\n\nShe was a pretty sad-looking old lady. Matter of fact she was--just\nstanding there, not even trying--the worst-looking old lady I ever\nsaw. She looked, to put it kindly, like a three-day corpse that had\nmade it the hard way after a century of poor health. First I thought,\nhell, I'll give the old bag of misery a boost, shove her under a bus or\nsomething. It would be the decent, kindly thing to do.\n\nI spoke, tentatively. She half-turned and looked up at me from her\nwitch's crouch. The eyes in the beak-nosed, ravaged ruin of a face were\nbig, luminous, a glowing green. They clearly belonged elsewhere and\nthere was a lost, appealing look in them. There was a demand there,\ntoo.\n\n\"I--uh--that is, would you care to cross with me, Madam?\" I asked her.\n\nShe took my arm. There was a moment's lull in the wake of a screaming\nprowl car. I muttered a word of prayer and we were off the curb. The\nold hag was surprisingly quick. It looked as though we were going to\nmake it. Then, three-quarters across, I came down with a rubber heel in\nan oil slick just as a roaring, grinding cement-mixer truck was coming\ndown on me like an avalanche. My feet went up. I gave the old witch a\nshove clear and shut my eyes for fear the coming sight of smeared blood\nand guts--my own--would make me sick.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd then, instead of a prone, cringing heap on the pavement sweating\nout the ten-to-one odds against all those wheels missing me, I was\nairborne. Cable-strong arms caught and lifted me. We were racing down\nfield, elusive, unstoppable, all the way--touchdown.\n\nSo there we were, safe on the sidewalk. Traffic on the freeway, gaping\nat us, was chaos as the frail, doddering little old lady put me down.\nMe, I was never any extra large size. But still, a touch under six\nfeet, maybe a little too friendly with beer and rich desserts--say,\n210 pounds--I had considered myself a little big for convenient\ncarrying about.\n\nThis was something new in little old ladies.\n\nI stared down at her. She wasn't even breathing hard. In fact I\ncouldn't tell if she was breathing at all. \"Madam,\" I said, \"my sincere\nthanks and admiration. I wonder now. If you're not late for practice\nwith the Bears or something, perhaps we could go someplace and talk?\" I\ncouldn't guess what, but there was for sure some sort of a story here.\nIf I could get something hot for the Sunday magazine, I'd have my job\nback.\n\nThe old crone looked up at me with those oddly out of place, compelling\neyes of hers. \"You will listen to me? You will help?\"\n\n\"Madam, help you don't need. But listen, yes. This is my great talent.\nI will be happy to listen to you.\"\n\nI thought a quiet booth and a couple of cold ones in Maxim's would be\nnice. No. She wondered in a different, quavering old voice, if greater\nprivacy might not be better. \"What I have to tell you, young man, may\nbe difficult for you to grasp. It may be necessary to show you some\nthings.\"\n\n\"Uh.\" She wasn't the type of doll I favored taking home for a sociable\nevening but it wouldn't have seemed mannerly to say no to the look of\nappeal in her eyes. \"All right.\"\n\nWe went on over to the parking lot and I drove her to the very\ncomfortable home out in Oakdale that Uncle John and Aunt Belle turned\nover to me when they rolled off to see the world from their house\ntrailer a year and a half back. Of course they dropped anchor in\nPetersburg and haven't budged since, but I guess it gives them the\nfootloose feeling they were looking for. And I have the house, which is\nquite a pleasant little place.\n\nI think Aunt Belle figured giving me the house would offset my own\ndubious attributes so that some nice girl might just possibly marry and\nmake something of me. But I kept a picture on my bureau of Uncle John,\nstanding by the sink in his apron, and was still holding out.\n\nWell, the old bat didn't clue me in on anything on the drive out there\nin my car. We chatted along the way, mostly her asking the questions,\nme answering. She was just a visitor to the town, she said. She wanted\nto find out all about it--with ten thousand nonsensical questions.\n\nI parked in the drive and we went in. While she settled down on the\nsofa I went to the bar, my addition to the home furnishings, to fix\na drink; wondered if there might still be any tea knocking around;\nthought better of that and mixed two drinks. Then I turned back toward\nher.\n\n\"Now,\" I said, \"tell me.\"\n\n\"Well,\" announced that ravaged wreck of an old woman, \"the fact is that\nI am from another world.\"\n\n\"Oh, hell,\" I said, \"how did you come in? By saucer or by broom?\" It\nwas a mean remark, I suppose. Not kindly. Even so, the way she took it\nseemed all out of proportion. The old bat's face suddenly went slack.\nShe slumped over sideways on the sofa, those big, green eyes open,\nstaring, empty. There was no need to go check for a pulse or heartbeat.\nShe was plainly, revoltingly dead.\n\n\"Ugh!\" I said and tossed off one of the two drinks I was holding. It\nseemed the thing to do.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Do not be alarmed,\" said an apparent voice. \"I am really perfectly all\nright. I have simply left that poor vehicle I was using. I had thought,\nwrongly it now seems, that communication with you chemically powered\nlife forms might be easier if I too were concealed within one such\nstructure.\"\n\nThe voice actually wasn't so much a voice as a voice impression. It\ncame from a point in the air above the body on the sofa. And it did\nmake an impression. It came through in a rush of meanings, too loud\nsomehow, almost overpowering.\n\nI looked toward the point of origin. That's what it was, as near\nas anything, a tiny pin-point of intense, green-gold light. It was\ntoo intense; I had to turn my eyes away. My head started to ache. I\nfelt and knew that, whatever species this might be, my visitor was a\nfemale of it. She was, at the moment, horribly overbearing. She was\ncommunicating effectively, enthusiastically, but unclearly and it\nwasn't easy. Not on me, anyway. My mind was swamped with a mass of\nconcepts, jabber and ideas, like all the women's clubs of the world\ntalking at once.\n\nI groaned and staggered back against the bar. \"All right,\" I yelled,\n\"all right, I believe you. You come from another world. You are an\namazing, wonderful girl and I am proud to entertain you. But please--go\nback to being an old woman, or something I can handle.\"\n\nThe ravaged old crone's eyes glowed again. She blinked and sat up.\n\"Please don't shout so. I can hear you,\" she remarked primly.\n\nI drained the other drink and put both glasses back on the bar. \"Ugh.\nUh, that's better. But who--where--what--?\"\n\n\"Please do stop and think a minute,\" the old witch told me. \"If you\nwill simply use that electro-chemical mental equipment of yours, you\nwill find that I have already given you the answers to those questions\nabout who and what I am and where I come from.\"\n\n\"Nonsense.\" But then it came to me that she had. I just hadn't taken\ntime to sort any of it out.\n\nI tried sorting. Much of it remained fuzzy, I suppose because some\naspects were so far outside the range of anything known to me. She\nwas, the way I got it, a life form based on something approximating\natomic energy. She came from a dwarf star out someplace, I couldn't\nquite place it, out Orion way I think. Sure, the entire concept was\nbeyond me and completely alien. And yet, oddly, in a lot of ways it\nwas like old home week. This was a kind of life totally different from\nours in all structure and development; and yet their kind of thought,\ntheir relationship to their world and their social organization, seemed\nweirdly familiar. They had work, recreation, social organization. They\nreproduced by some sort of polarity business I didn't get then and\nstill don't; but it required mating and it certainly seemed a fair\napproximation of sex.\n\nThey had arts based on forms and shaped patterns of energy. I don't\nget it. She said it compared to our literature, music and painting\nand I take her word for it. \"Only,\" as she later explained a touch\nwistfully, \"terribly, terribly decadent in the present era.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was their problem. Their social structure and individuals alike\nseemed, at last, to be losing all vitality. The birth rate dropped.\nCulture declined. They had, fairly recently by their standards,\ndiscovered the possibility of freeing themselves from their sun and\ntravelling through space. But, while they found planets with chemical\nlife forms like us not uncommon in space, they had found no form\ncomparable to their own. Outside contacts, they had thought, might\nstimulate and re-vitalize their society. But, of course, where there is\nlife there is politics. They had developed many and bitter differences\nof opinion regarding the feasibility or value of any attempt to\ncommunicate with chemical life forms. There was a party for, a party\nagainst and several favoring an agonizing reappraisal of the position\nwhatever it might turn out to be. Nothing was done. And that, in due\ncourse, had brought me my lone lady visitor.\n\nThe \"communication\" party decided to take action in spite of the\nabsence of official sanction. They worked cautiously, in secret.\nSpecially selected representatives with certain exceptional kinds and\ndegrees of sensitivity were made ready. Necessary energy supplies for\ndistant space travel were carefully hoarded. Chances of anything coming\nof it were considered slim but ... there was the horrible old hag\nsitting on my sofa, looking hopefully up at me out of great, youthfully\nglowing green eyes.\n\nAnyway, that's the way the thing shaped up in my mind. And it seemed\nplenty hard to believe.\n\n\"Must I come out and show you again?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said quickly. \"Oh, no, please don't. I'm convinced.\"\n\n\"Or will be,\" she remarked cryptically. \"Good. This now proves that\nat least one level of communication between us is possible. This is\npromising. It could mark the beginning of a relationship which may be\nmost stimulating for both life forms.\"\n\nWell, it was startling at least, I would have to admit that. \"Speaking\nof forms,\" I said, \"You sure picked an ugly one there. Why?\"\n\n\"Oh? But I am only now beginning to understand your standards of\nattraction. I took this structure--\" she pointed one gnarled, knotty\nhand at herself--\"because in my own form no one seemed willing to\nlisten or accept me logically. They only yelled that I was an A-bomb\nor a short circuit or lightning, or else simply pretended they didn't\nsee me at all. So I took this body, making only a few small internal\nrepairs and improvements. But then, until you came along, no one would\nstop long enough to listen to me.\"\n\n\"Hum. Where'd you get it?\"\n\n\"I picked it up at one of your places for them to die. What you\ncall the cold room at the County Hospital. There was, I admit, some\nconfusion.\"\n\nThat I could believe.\n\n\"You are not nearly as different from us in mental processes and\ncustoms as I should have thought. Such an intriguing life form, with\nsuch amusing complications. Just strange enough to be exciting. Come\nover here and sit by me.\"\n\nShe beckoned coyly, like a flirtatious girl, and winked one youthfully\nglowing eye at me. The effect, in that ruin of a face, was appalling. I\nstayed where I was.\n\n\"Oh,\" she said in a hurt tone, \"you don't like me? And you seemed so\nattractively receptive at first. How can we communicate completely\non your plane if you are to be so aloof?\" She stopped and seemed to\nconcentrate a moment. I felt as if something gave my thoughts a brisk\nstirring with a long swizzle stick.\n\n\"Damn it,\" I snapped, \"quit that, you hear me? You've got to stop\nmessing around in my mind. It's an outrageous invasion of--\"\n\n\"All right, all right,\" she said. \"I won't do it again, I promise.\nUnless--well, never mind.\" A typically feminine-type promise. \"But now\nI see that it is simply this body that offends you. Except for this,\nyou are quite ready to love me.\"\n\nThat was putting it a little strongly. I had to admit though, that she\nwas a pretty interesting proposition.\n\n\"It is odd to attach such importance to form. A chemical life\ncharacteristic, I suppose. I do note that your own structure has\nits--well. There is no reason for this present form of mine being a\nproblem between us. I shall simply change it.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" Like changing a dress, she made it sound. It wasn't quite that\neasy.\n\n\"You must make it clear to me what sort of body you prefer. Oh, I see.\nThat tall, widely curved one with the red hair. Yes, I see the\nimage ... my ... and so lightly clad. Very well. I will have this body\nfor you.\"\n\nShe was reading my mind again, the back corner section where I was\nkeeping a few brightly descriptive memos on Venus de Lite, that\nluscious, languorous, long-legged new stripper-exotic dancer downtown\nat the Roma. \"That,\" I told her, not without a touch of wistful regret,\n\"is a live body. You cannot take live bodies. And stop reading my mind.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry. I won't do it again.\" She kept saying that; and doing it\njust the same. \"I shall not have to take the original body. I can\nsimply duplicate it.\"\n\n\"How could you do that?\"\n\n\"It should not be difficult. The elements in the structure are common\nenough here and in readily modified forms. The body organization\nis complex, true, and not particularly efficient in many respects.\nHowever, the patterns can be readily traced and duplicated. It is a\nsimple question of the application of energy to chemical matter. So now\nyou must take me to observe this body which has such attraction for\nyou.\"\n\n\nII\n\nThat as it turned out, was the toughest part. I did what I could,\ntrying to fix the horrible old witch up in an outfit from one of Aunt\nBelle's old trunks and a few rather elementary cosmetics. The end\nresult was that, instead of looking like a plain old witch, she seemed\na scandalously depraved, probably drunken old witch. The Roma, in a\nlong history dating back to prohibition days, has seen all kinds and\nconditions. But I don't doubt we were one of the damnedest looking\ncouples on record.\n\n\"This--uh--this is my Grandma,\" I told the few, nastily grinning\nacquaintances I couldn't duck on our way into the joint. \"Grandma is\njust up on a little visit from Lower Dogpatch. Excuse us, would you?\nGrandma needs a double shot quick.\"\n\nThat seemed unarguable. We finally settled at a small table off by the\nswinging doors to the kitchen and sat there through one floor show.\n\"All right,\" said my old witch, as Venus closed the set with her final\nfrenzy in the blue spotlight, \"I have the pattern. There are a number\nof differences there from the picture in your mind. The age, the\nchemicals applied.\"\n\nVenus went off to vigorous applause. The club lights came up and the\nM.C. stumbled out to favor us with his version of The Gent's Room\nJoe Miller. I considered. The more beautiful-looking the doll, I\nsuppose, the greater the probable degree of illusion. \"Where you find\ndiscrepancies,\" I told my old witch, \"be guided by my imagination.\nRight?\"\n\n\"All rightie,\" she remarked brightly, patting my hand on the table as\nshe favored me with what I would estimate as one of history's lewdest\nwinks. I noted a mutter of contempt from surrounding tables. \"Shall I\ngo ahead? Perhaps you'd better close your eyes,\" she said, \"I--\"\n\n\"No, not here!\" I grabbed her arm and dragged her to her feet. Neighbor\ntables gave us their full attention and the muttering took on an\nominous tone. \"Come on. For pity's sake, let's get on home.\" I wasn't\nexactly convinced this proposition was going to work out; but a crowded\nnightclub was no place for her to try it.\n\n\"Graverobber!\" was one of the indignant remarks that caught my ear as I\ndragged the harridan out. She giggled. The female, species immaterial,\nseems to have a sense of humor ranging from the Pollyanna-like to the\ngraveyard ghoulish--missing nearly every point between.\n\nShe was quiet and thoughtful on the ride back home. So was I, pondering\nthe doubtful status of my reputation around town and my sanity.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the house, she was brisk and businesslike. She got me to help her\nstack a bunch of canned goods and junk from the refrigerator on the\nkitchen table--\"Just for convenience.\" She remarked domestically, \"It\nwould have saved your fuel and power if I had made the change at the\nother place. I must draw heavily on the power that runs into this\nhouse. I must, you understand, conserve my own supply.\"\n\n\"Perfectly all right. Be my guest.\" The whole thing had a sort of dream\nquality to it by then. You know how it is in dreams sometimes? The\naction and story lines are fantastic. You know the whole thing must be\nnonsense. You could, by an effort of will, wake up and end it. And yet\nyou go along with the thing just to see how the foolishness will turn\nout. That is the way I felt then.\n\n\"Oh yes, one more detail,\" said my witch. \"What about the eyes? I found\nnothing about the color of the eyes in your largely imaginary mental\npicture of the cheap floozy in that second-rate saloon.\"\n\nAlready she was not only speaking the language but thinking the\nthoughts like a native female. The eyes. Hmm. I guess my mental film\nstrips of Venus had kind of skipped past facial close-ups. \"Why don't\nyou just keep the same eyes you have now?\" I suggested.\n\n\"Good,\" she said. \"They are my own design. Here goes. Close your eyes;\nthere may be some glare.\"\n\nI closed my eyes. For a moment there was nothing. Then, for about a\nsecond, say, there was an intense, flaring glare that shone reddish\nthrough my closed lids. Then it was dark.\n\n\"All righty,\" said a sweet-soft voice, ending in a little,\nhalf-breathless giggle. \"Now you can look.\"\n\nI looked.\n\nTrouble was, it was still dark. No lights. All I could see by the faint\nlight of a half moon filtering in the kitchen window was a dim figure\nstanding by the table.\n\nFact was, I found later, a sudden power surge on the main line outside\nthe house blew a transformer and blacked out the whole blinking suburb.\n\nI snapped out my lighter and flicked it on. Well now, indeed! There,\nhalf shy, half not so shy and wearing the same negligible costume as in\nher final number at the Roma, was Venus, constructed just exactly the\nway she should have been.\n\n\"The way I built me,\" she said, and giggled, \"to your very explicit\norder. So now what are you going to--\"\n\nI wouldn't say that I am notably more impetuous than the next man.\nThat was just an impetuous situation. I let the lighter go and grabbed\nher. \"Ah,\" I remember her saying softly, \"now we can truly begin to\ncommunicate.\"\n\nI can say with every reasonable assurance that we did so most\neffectively. Alien she was, but she was also a lovely girl, my own\ndream girl. Or girls. What man of any imagination at all is a totally\nmonogamous dreamer? Anyway, she was unarguably lovely, loving, uniquely\nadaptable, generally sweet. And if, once her frequently unfathomable\nmind was made up, she had the determination of seven dedicated\ndevils--well, she was female and probably no worse than some billion\nlocal girls. My little atom-powered space girl had a lot more built-in\ncompensating factors.\n\nBut that's as it developed. That night, naturally, was largely devoted\nto communication. Luckily, having been fired, I didn't need to worry\nabout getting up to go to work.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAlong about eleven or so the next morning she bounced out of bed,\nbright, beautiful and lively. I dragged on down to the kitchen with her\nto see if we could put together a breakfast from whatever staples she\nhadn't found it necessary to incorporate into new construction. By the\nkitchen table I stumbled over the most ravaged, deadest looking corpse\nI ever hope to see. It was, of course, the unlamented body of the\noriginal witch, lying just where it had dropped the evening before.\n\n\"Look, hon, what about this?\"\n\nShe shrugged quite charmingly, in spite of the tentlike dimensions of\nAunt Belle's nightgown. \"What about it?\"\n\n\"Well, why didn't you use the--uh--material there, instead of all the\ngroceries?\"\n\nAnother shrug. \"I wanted something fresh.\"\n\nShe had a point. I couldn't argue. I never could, when she turned those\nbig green eyes of hers on me, full power. \"Yeah,\" I said. \"Only what\nare we going to do with it?\"\n\n\"What do your kind do with old bodies here?\"\n\n\"Mostly we bury them.\"\n\n\"All right then.\"\n\nThat was unassailable feminine logic. All right. So I'd bury it.\n\nThat night, by the eerie light of the waning moon, I went at it with\nUncle John's pick and shovel and buried the old witch's body next to\nAunt Belle's rose bushes by the garage. My bright, new-incarnation\ngirl lounged around and chatted sociably. Everything still had quite a\ndreamlike quality; the corpse was a final, nightmare touch. But even\nso, I was beginning to wonder a bit about things; such things as,\nspecifically, where we went from there.\n\n\"Star-doll-baby--\" well, hell, there are times when a man has to use\nterms like that to communicate with the female--\"you aren't going to\nvanish all of a sudden and leave me now, are you? Ugh!\" That was a\nheavy shovel and thick clay. \"What are our plans?\"\n\n\"Sil-ly. I understand your custom now. We are going to be married,\nof course. Then we shall see. There is no hurry. I have, by your\nstandards, plenty of time. I must assimilate and learn to understand\nyou and your fascinating life-form. We shall live together and be man\nand wife. As I have said, your species and mine may derive much benefit\nfrom this intermingling.\"\n\nThat, if I understood her correctly, sounded fine to me. It was\nthe best proposal I'd had yet. And surely it would have been poor\nhospitality to a lonely little girl some light-years away from home\nfor me to have refused. \"This is terribly sudden,\" I told her. \"Uf!\nThat ought to be enough of a hole for as wizened up a little old body\nas that ... yes, darling, I will marry you. Who's going to earn us a\nliving?\"\n\n\nIII\n\nI climbed out of the hole and kissed her and, in time, we did manage to\nget the old woman buried.\n\nThe next day we applied for our license. Three days later we were\nmarried--so far as I know, an interstellar first. The job or money\nproblem, as it turned out, was no problem. Her first thought was the\ndirect, female approach to the problem. She could simply make it out of\nold newspapers whenever we needed some, as she had the body. She made\nsome to show me.\n\n\"Well now,\" I told her, \"it does seem the simplest way, I admit. But\nthe government is pretty jealous of its ability to print money. It\nlikes to think that nobody else can do the job just right.\"\n\nI was afraid this might be one of her stubborn points but it wasn't.\nGovernment restrictions, bureaucracy and red tape were things she had\nno trouble understanding. \"It is the same way back home with power and\nenergy rations,\" she told me. \"You have no idea the difficulty we had\nin building up the capital supply necessary for my trip here. So I\nsuppose we must find another way. Don't you already have some of this\nmoney? Or couldn't you manage to borrow some?\"\n\nI had $37.62 in my checking account, but the house was in my name. I\nborrowed five grand. I invested. I was probably the most successful\ninvestor since old King Midas developed his touch. If I sank a buck\nin land, oil would turn up within the week, and if it turned out to be\na geologically inexplicable tiny pocket the next week--that would be\nafter I had unloaded. Stocks, commodities, it made no difference. The\nmoney rolled in. We had the touch. Paid our taxes, too, but she had\na way with tax loopholes that gave the district collector a nervous\nbreakdown.\n\nWe traveled, but we kept the old house. We always came back to it for\nsentimental reasons. We spent a lot of time in libraries, museums. We\nwent to shows and concerts. Anything that was going, we went to it. She\nhad a contagious interest that she communicated to--not to say forced\non--me; and if some of the operas and symphonies we caught seemed to\nmy elemental musical taste to run a little long and loud, I had my\ncompensations. And a lot more than most; our adjustments were not all\none-sided.\n\nExample: We made a tour of Europe. Now, I always was a fine,\nloving husband to her. Completely faithful. But--well, there was a\ndark-haired, laughing, button-cute little chick who sang Spanish songs\nin English with an Italian accent in a little place on the Riviera. I\ndidn't make a pass. I didn't even speak to her. But I have to admit\nthat, as a strictly idle fancy, she did cross my mind once or twice.\n\n\"Hah!\" my tall, statuesque, beautiful red-haired wife snorted at me one\nevening after we were back home. She was sitting listening to hi-fi,\nsome of the very long-hair music that she called \"the second most\nfascinating development of your kind.\" I was just sitting, maybe dozing\na bit.\n\n\"So!\" She gave it full-force, wifely indignation. \"You sit there and\nyou smile on me--and all the time you are thinking of this cheap,\nfemale, singing bullfighter you have seen two times. You have two times\nme in your mind!\"\n\nAlready she was talking with just the accent that chick had used.\n\n\"Now look here,\" I protested, \"you promised not to go prowling through\nmy mind. A man is entitled to a little privacy!\"\n\n\"How can you think so of this other woman? You don't--\" sob--\"love me\nany more!\"\n\nWomen! That's the way trying to argue with them goes. You are always on\nthe defensive.\n\n\"Aw now, Star-hon-baby,\" I said, \"honestly, it was just a passing\nthought. I only--\"\n\n\"I know what sort of thought it was! Very well.\" She got up and stalked\noff to the kitchen. I didn't get what she was up to, not even when I\nheard her banging temperishly about out there.\n\nWhen there was a sudden flash and the lights blinked out, the idea hit\nme. I was scared. What if she had gone back, left me? I dashed to the\nkitchen. Just through the swinging door, I tripped over a body and fell\ninto the kitchen table. Had she--? Then I heard a charming, slightly\naccented little giggle.\n\nI didn't bother with my lighter. I reached out, caught her, pulled\nmy sweet little dark-haired baby to me and kissed her. \"Honey-doll,\nbelieve me--I do love you. No matter who you are, I love you!\"\n\nI meant every word of it, too. That was a brand of accommodation you\nwill never get from any local girl.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next night I had to dig a new grave out by the garage--a bigger\none this time, for a big, beautiful, long-legged, red-haired body.\nFunny thing. Contrary to general belief, none of this ever seemed to do\nanything for the roses by the garage. They had done poorly ever since\nAunt Belle left and they kept on doing poorly. Well, no matter. Six\nmonths later it was the little brunette's turn to go and we went back\nto red hair. When I say my wife was all women to me, I mean it.\n\nThe last model was medium height, Titian shade hair, not spectacular\nbut cute, very companionable, very lovable, beautifully built, built\nto last. She was some builder, my wife, and she did a lot of fine\nconstruction work for me.\n\nOne night, back along about the third week of our marriage, I got to\nfeeling lousy--sniffles, headache, no appetite.\n\nIt was no dramatic plague; just a typical, nasty case of flu. I used to\nget them every fall and winter. I mixed myself a couple of hot lemon\nand's, and explained it to my (tall, red headed) wife. \"Oh, yes,\" she\nsaid. \"I see.\"\n\nI had an idea she took another quick prowl through my mind but I felt\ntoo sick to complain. \"I'm going to bed,\" I told her. I went.\n\nOddly enough, instead of putting in a restless night, I slept like a\nlog. When I woke up the next morning, I felt great. In fact, as I burst\ninto a spontaneous and very tuneful chorus of _Body and Soul_ in the\nshower, it came to me that I had never in my life felt so well. When\nI looked in the mirror to shave, it seemed to me I was even looking\nbetter.\n\nLater that day I was up on the roof putting up a TV aerial. I hadn't\never bothered with TV, but she wanted to learn all about even that. I\nput up the aerial. Then I fell off the roof. I dropped twelve feet,\nlanding on my left arm and shoulder on hard-packed lawn. Then I got up\nand dusted myself off. No damage. I was all right.\n\n\"Clumsy,\" she said to me from the porch.\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"Damn it, there was this loose shingle up there. It\nslipped right out from under me and--anyway, you might at least be a\nlittle sympathetic. It's a wonder I didn't break my arm. In fact, I\ncan't understand why I didn't.\"\n\n\"Nothing broke because of the improvements I made in you last night.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Darling,\" she said, \"I made a few improvements. Of course, you were\nvery attractive, lover. Perfectly charming. But structurally, really,\nyou were a most imperfect mechanism. So now that I have made a study of\nthese bodies your people use, I ... rebuilt you.\"\n\n\"Oh? Oh! Now, look here! Who in hell said you could?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt did, at the time, seem pretty damned officious. I was sore. However,\nI had to admit that the changes she made worked out rather well. A\nstrong, light metallic alloy seems to make much better bones than\ncan be made of calcium. General immunity to disease was desirable,\nI couldn't deny. My re-wired nervous system and modified muscular\nstructure were as pleasant to work with as they were efficient. I was a\nnew man.\n\nOf course, every woman always wants to make a finer specimen of\nwhatever slob she marries. Only I had the luck to get the one who knew\nhow to do the job properly--from the inside out, rather than by simply\npeck, peck, pecking away at the outside.\n\nIt was all as near perfect as a marriage can be. I have no complaints\nnow--and very few even then. She had built me to last a couple of\ncenturies. I was ready and willing to string along with her all the way.\n\nBut it never does work out that way, does it?\n\nWhat happened to us, as it does to most, was that at the end of the\nthird year she got pregnant. A very ordinary female trait, you may say,\nand not ordinarily surprising. No. Except that she was no ordinary\nfemale.\n\nWe were in bed one night--our last night as it turned out--when she\ntold me.\n\n\"Darling,\" she said, and kissed me. \"I have something to tell you.\"\n\n\"Haw?\" I was sort of sleepy.\n\n\"I've been hoping and hoping it would happen, but I wasn't sure it\ncould.\"\n\n\"Ha? Whatsat?\"\n\n\"Darling, we--are going to become parents.\"\n\n\"What?\" I was awake then. \"We're going to have a baby? Why, that's\ngreat. Wonderful! Do you think he'll take after me?\" As I thought it\nover, it seemed something of a problem. What would the heredity be? In\nfact, _how_ could it be?\n\n\"Never mind, darling,\" she said quietly--sadly, I like to think, as I\nlook back on it. \"That's woman's work, you know. Just leave the details\nto me.\"\n\nI kissed her. We were very loving and tender. I went to sleep, and\ndreamed all night long that I was Siamese twins in a fratricidal finish\nfight over my model wife.\n\n\nIV\n\nI woke up by daylight to a horrible, icy, lost and separated feeling,\nas though part of me had really died. I reached out my hand for\nreassurance--and I yelled.\n\nThat sweet, soft-curved body in the bed next to me was cold and dead.\n\n\"Please! don't be frightened. It's all right. Really, it's all\nright.\" That was a voice that wasn't a voice again, as back in the\nbeginning. It was familiar and at the same time new. It _wasn't_ all\nright! I looked up, over the bed. There were not one but two tiny,\nblinding-bright pinpoints of light.\n\n\"What? Who?\"\n\n\"Father,\" they said, \"we are your children.\"\n\nThey were certainly not my idea of it.\n\n\"No. Oh, no! Star-baby, where are you?\"\n\n\"Here. We were she. Now she plus you has become us. She has divided and\nnow we are two, the children of you and she.\"\n\n\"Nonsense. Quit the double talk and give it to me straight!\" Double\ntalk it was. But if it was nonsense, it was an unhappy sort of nonsense\nI couldn't get around.\n\nComing slightly out of shock, I tried arguing and got nowhere. I never\nwon any arguments from their mother either. I was convinced in spite\nof myself that this was the simple, brutal truth. It was the way of\nreproduction of her form of life. My alien wife had divided, to become\ntwo half-alien offspring.\n\nI felt lousy. I didn't _want_ two bright, pin-point kids. I wanted my\nwife. \"But look, why couldn't one of you--\"\n\n\"Why, father!\" I got it in a tone of shocked horror. \"Such a thing\nwould be positively incestuous. No. We must go now. This is what\nmother-we came here for--to mix and to re-vitalize her-our people by\nthe addition of a fresh, new stream of life force.\"\n\n\"You mean me?\" It was flattering to think my stock would invigorate\nthe population of a sun, but it was no cure for the loneliness in which\nI was lost. \"You are going back across space--and leave me here alone?\"\n\n\"Yes, father. We must leave at once.\"\n\n\"Oh, now, wait just one radiating little minute! You say I'm your\nfather. Well, I forbid--\"\n\nWeary patience. \"Now, father, please.\"\n\n\"But--will you come back sometime?\"\n\n\"Certainly. With the success of her-our mission, we hope the factions\nback home will unite in a policy of further interchange. We and others\nof our family will come. Soon, we hope. It could even prove possible\nto find a way of converting you to our own form, so that later you may\nreturn with us.\"\n\n\"But look--\"\n\nBut that was it. A few more words and, \"Goodby, father,\" they said,\nputting a reasonable amount of regret into it--even though I know\ndamned well they were itching to get going. \"And do take care of\nyourself.\"\n\nThey were gone. I was alone. No big, lush and lovely wife; no\nbutton-cute little brunette wife; no gay, lively, companionable, loving\nTitian-haired wife. No wife at all.\n\nI had never been so alone. Nothing but me. What was I to do?\n\nWell, there was only one possible thing to do, and I did it. I got\ndrunk. I hung one on. It was a beauty. Sometime in the course of the\nfollowing night I held a tearful wake out by the garage and I buried\nmy wife's last body. That, I recognize, was thoughtless. I could and\nshould have called doctors and undertakers to tell me there was no life\nleft in the body, and then let them do the digging for me in a more\nformal, costly manner. But, for one thing, I was drunk. For another, I\nguess I'd just sort of gotten into the habit of doing it the other way.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMuch too early the next day--like about 2:30 in the afternoon--the\ndoorbell rang. I was totally despondent, nursing my sorrow and a fat\nhangover with a cold beer and some of my Star-baby's more heavily\nlong-hair, hi-fi selections.\n\nI let the bell ring for a while. Then I let somebody pound on the door\nfor a bit. But that got to be hard on my headache so I went to the door.\n\nThere was Mrs. Schmerler, from next door, who used to be a real\nbiddy-buddy of my Aunt Belle's. There were a couple of hard-eyed cops\nwith her, too. They all pushed right on in.\n\n\"Celebrating something, Mac?\" inquired cop number one, while Mrs.\nSchmerler and the other glared suspiciously about.\n\n\"No,\" I said, too miserable to think. \"Not celebrating, mourning. Just\nlost my wife, and kids, too.\"\n\n\"He never had any children!\" said Mrs. Schmerler. \"Only women. And a\ngreat deal too many of the cheap tarts. What his poor, dear Aunt Belle,\nas saintly a woman as ever lived, would say.... Why don't you ask him\nwhat he was digging for--digging and yowling _Star dust_--out there by\nhis garage last night? And not the first time, neither!\"\n\nThe sudden realization of what could be turned up out there by the\ngarage--and how that would look to the unsympathetic and non-credulous\neyes of the law--hit me. I opened and closed my mouth three or four\ntimes like an unwell goldfish. Nothing came out except a miasma of\nalcohol. Mrs. Schmerler gaped at me with delighted shock, indignation\nand horror. It was the great moment of her life.\n\nThe cops stepped in--not aggressively, more big-brotherly--and took a\ngood, firm grip on my arm.\n\nI won't go into the rest of all that. They got a squad and they dug.\nThey took me in. I wouldn't talk. They locked me up. Cell block\nbookies quoted 50-1, no takers, I would make the death cell. The way\nI felt, I didn't care. The newspapers went wild. Things had been\nslow since the election. All my old pals from my working days on the\npaper were making a buck with special \"Even then there was something\nfrighteningly different about him\" feature stories.\n\nThe next day, as my hangover faded and I got to thinking things over,\nmy outlook changed. It was no time for me to give up. I would get a\nlawyer.\n\nI walked over to rattle my cell door for a bit. \"Hey! Hey there, guard.\nCome here a minute, huh?\"\n\nHe came. \"So? Is our Bluebeard softening up? Want to make a statement?\"\n\n\"Uh-uh. Not me. I just want to ask a question. Those bodies, are they\ngoing to autopsy them?\"\n\n\"Not yet. Today.\"\n\n\"Well, look--\"\n\nI had a little trouble persuading him, but I got him to take down all\nthe data I could remember on the first one, the old hag. There would\nbe records on her at the County Hospital. They'd never make any charge\nworse than body-snatching stick on that one.\n\nThe others? I chuckled. I was imagining the medical officers'\nexpressions when they ran into those stainless-steel bones, plastic\ncirculatory system, metallic wiring and the assorted other little\ninnovations that my wife--my _late_ wife--had installed in her\nbody-building exercises. That would give them something to think about.\n\nSo--that's my story; all of it up to now. I'm still here in my cool\nlittle cell, and I am damned lonesome. But I am not scared. I figure I\nhave about four different kinds of insurance.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the first place, the way I am built now, with all the improvements\nin structure and durability she put into me, I doubt they could\nelectrocute me. I'd probably just short the equipment out. A thing like\nthat would make me quite a scientific curiosity, no doubt; but not, at\nleast, a dead one.\n\nSecond, there are my investments and the way the money has piled up.\nYou know and I know perfectly well that they just don't ever send a\nmillion bucks plus to any electric chair.\n\nBesides, third place, while I have no doubt I can be convicted of\nsomething, I don't see how it could be murder. I wouldn't be surprised\nto see me get sent to the loony bin. I won't much mind that. I have\nnothing to do but wait anyway.\n\nAnd, in the fourth place, which is what I am waiting for, there are my\nchildren--hers and mine. They are coming back. Soon, I hope. Not alone,\nI hope. \"Tell them back there,\" was the last thing I said before they\nleft, \"tell them I want a girl just like the girl that married your\ndear old dad.\"\n\nI admit it's a poor thing for a man to have to send his kids to do his\ncourting for him--but at least mine are pretty exceptional children.\nMuch better informed than most, too. They should bring me back a new\nbride. They've got to.\n\nSomehow I kind of have a feeling now that a blonde--maybe a tall,\nwillowy, statuesquely stacked type--might be nice for a while. After\nthat, I don't know. I'll have to think it over. The waiting is what is\ngoing to be tough.\n\nKids aren't really undependable today. Are they?\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Star-Crossed Lover, by William W.

To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org\n\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
