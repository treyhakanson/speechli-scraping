He was hungry now\nas he walked through the alley, his eyes shifting lusterlessly from one\nheap of rubbish to the next. He was hungry through and through, all\none hundred and forty pounds of him, the flesh distributed so gauntly\nover his tall frame that in spots it seemed about to wear through, as\nhis clothes had. That it hadn't done so in forty-two years sometimes\nstruck Ollie as in the nature of a miracle.\n\nHe worked for a junk collector and he was unsuccessful in his present\njob, as he had been at everything else. Ollie had followed the first\npart of the rags-to-riches formula with classic exactness. He had been\nborn to rags, and then, as if that hadn't been enough, his parents had\ndied, and he had been left an orphan. He should have gone to the big\ncity, found a job in the rich merchant's counting house, and saved the\npretty daughter, acquiring her and her fortune in the process.\n\nIt hadn't worked out that way. In the orphanage where he had spent so\nmany unhappy years, both his food and his education had been skimped.\nHe had later been hired out to a farmer, but he hadn't been strong\nenough for farm labor, and he had been sent back.\n\nHis life since then had followed an unhappy pattern. Lacking strength\nand skill, he had been unable to find and hold a good job. Without a\ngood job, he had been unable to pay for the food and medical care, and\nfor the training he would have needed to acquire strength and skill.\nOnce, in the search for food and training, he had offered himself to\nthe Army, but the doctors who examined him had quickly turned thumbs\ndown, and the Army had rejected him with contempt. They wanted better\nhuman material than that.\n\nHow he had managed to survive at all to the present was another\nmiracle. By this time, of course, he knew, as the radio comic put it,\nthat he wasn't long for this world. And to make the passage to another\nworld even easier, he had taken to drink. Rot gut stilled the pangs of\nhunger even more effectively than inadequate food did. And it gave\nhim the first moments of happiness, spurious though they were, that he\ncould remember.\n\nNow, as he sought through the heaps of rubbish for usable rags or\nredeemable milk bottles, his eyes lighted on something unexpected.\nRight at the edge of the curb lay a small nut, species indeterminate.\nIf he had his usual luck, it would turn out to be withered inside, but\nat least he could hope for the best.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe picked up the nut, banged it futilely against the ground, and then\nlooked around for a rock with which to crack it. None was in sight.\nRather fearfully, he put it in his mouth and tried to crack it between\nhis teeth. His teeth were in as poor condition as the rest of him, and\nthe chances were that they would crack before the nut did.\n\nThe nut slipped and Ollie gurgled, threw his hands into the air and\nalmost choked. Then he got it out of his windpipe and, a second later,\nbreathed easily. The nut was in his stomach, still uncracked. And\nOllie, it seemed to him, was hungrier than ever.\n\nThe alley was a failure. His life had been a progression from rags to\nrags, and these last rags were inferior to the first. There were no\nmilk bottles, there was no junk worth salvaging.\n\nAt the end of the alley was a barber shop, and here Ollie had a great\nand unexpected stroke of luck. He found a bottle. The bottle was no\ncontainer for milk and it wasn't empty. It was standing on a small\ntable near an open window in the rear of the barber shop. Ollie found\nthat he could get it by simply stretching out his long, gaunt arm for\nit, without climbing in through the window at all.\n\nHe took a long swig, and then another. The liquor tasted far better\nthan anything he had ever bought.\n\nWhen he returned the bottle to its place, it was empty.\n\nStrangely enough, despite its excellent quality, or perhaps, he\nthought, _because_ of it, the whiskey failed to have its usual effect\non him. It left him completely sober and clear-eyed, but hungrier than\never.\n\nIn his desperation, Ollie did something that he seldom dared to do. He\nwent into a restaurant, not too good a restaurant or he would never\nhave been allowed to take a seat, and ordered a meal he couldn't pay\nfor.\n\nHe knew what would happen, of course, after he had eaten. He would\nput on an act about having lost his money, but that wouldn't fool the\nmanager for more than one second. If the man was feeling good and\nneeded help, he'd let Ollie work the price out washing dishes. If he\nwas a little grumpy and had all the dishwashers he needed, he'd have\nthem boot the tar out of Ollie and then turn him over to the police.\n\nThe soup was thick and tasty, although tasty in a way that no gourmet\nwould have appreciated. The mess was food, however, and Ollie gulped it\ndown gratefully. But it did nothing to satisfy his hunger. Likewise,\nthe stew had every possible leftover thrown into it, and none of it\ngave Ollie any feeling of satisfaction. Even the dessert and the muddy\ncoffee left him as empty as before.\n\nThe waiter had been in the back room with the cook. Now Ollie saw him\nsignal to the manager, and watched the manager hasten back. He closed\nhis eyes. They were onto him; there was no doubt about it. For a\nmoment he considered trying to get out of the front door before they\nclosed in, but there was another waiter present, keeping an eye on the\npatrons, and he knew that he would never make it. He took a deep breath\nand waited for the roof to fall in on him.\n\nHe heard the manager's foot-steps and opened his eyes. The manager\nsaid, \"Uh--look, bud, about that meal you ate--\"\n\n\"Not bad,\" observed Ollie brightly.\n\n\"Glad you liked it.\"\n\nHe noticed little beads of sweat on the manager's forehead, and\nwondered what had put them there. He said, \"Only trouble is, it ain't\nfillin'. I'm just as hungry as I was before.\"\n\n\"It didn't fill you up, huh? That's too bad. I'll tell you what I'll\ndo. Rather than see you go away dissatisfied, I won't charge you for\nthe meal. Not a cent.\"\n\nOllie blinked. This made no sense whatever. All the same, if not for\nthe gnawing in his stomach, he would have picked himself up and run. As\nit was, he said, \"Thanks. Guess in that case I'll have another order of\nstew. Maybe this time it'll stick to my ribs.\"\n\n\"Not the stew,\" replied the manager nervously. \"You had the last that\nwas left. Try the roast beef.\"\n\n\"Hmm, that's more than I was gonna spend.\"\n\n\"No charge,\" said the manager. \"For you, no charge at all.\"\n\n\"Then gimme a double order. I feel starved.\"\n\nThe double order went down the hatch, yet Ollie felt just as empty as\never. But he was afraid to press his luck too far, and after he had\ndowned one more dessert--also without charge--he reluctantly picked\nhimself up and walked out. He was too hungry to spend any more time\nwondering why he had got a free meal.\n\nIn the back room of the restaurant, the manager sank weakly into a\nchair. \"I was afraid he was going to insist on paying for it. Then we'd\nreally have been on a spot.\"\n\n\"Guess he was too glad to get it for free,\" the cook said.\n\n\"Well, if anything happens to him now, it'll happen away from here.\"\n\n\"Suppose they take a look at what's in his stomach.\"\n\n\"He still won't be able to sue us. What did you do with the rest of\nthat stew?\"\n\n\"It's in the garbage.\"\n\n\"Cover it up. We don't want dead cats and dogs all over the place.\nAnd next time you reach for the salt, make sure there isn't an insect\npowder label on it.\"\n\n\"It was an accident; it could happen to anybody,\" said the cook\nphilosophically. \"You know, maybe we shouldn't have let that guy go\naway. Maybe we ought to have sent him to a doctor.\"\n\n\"And pay his bills? Don't be a sap. From now on, he's on his own.\nWhatever happens to him, we don't know anything about it. We never saw\nhim before.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe only thing that was happening to Ollie was that he was getting\nhungrier and hungrier. He had, in fact, never before been so ravenous.\nHe felt as if he hadn't eaten in years.\n\nHe had met with two strokes of luck--the accessible bottle and the\nincredibly generous manager. They had left him just as hungry and\nthirsty as before. Now he encountered a third gift of fortune. On the\nplate glass window of a restaurant was the flamboyant announcement:\nEATING CONTEST TONIGHT AT MONTE'S RESTAURANT! FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP\nOF THE WORLD! ENTRIES BEING TAKEN NOW! NO CHARGE IF YOU EAT ENOUGH FOR\nAT LEAST THREE PEOPLE.\n\nOllie's face brightened. The way he felt, he could have eaten enough\nfor a hundred. The fact that the contestants, as he saw upon reading\nfurther, would be limited to hard-boiled eggs made no difference to\nhim. For once he would have a chance to eat everything he could get\ndown his yawning gullet.\n\nThat night it was clear that neither the judges nor the audience\nthought much of Ollie as an eater. Hungry he undoubtedly was, but it\nwas obvious that his stomach had shrunk from years of disuse, and\nbesides, he didn't have the build of a born eater. He was long and\nskinny, whereas the other contestants seemed almost as broad and wide\nas they were tall. In gaining weight, as in so many other things, the\nmotto seemed to be that those who already had would get more. Ollie\nhad too little to start with.\n\nIn order to keep the contest from developing an anticlimax, they\nstarted with Ollie, believing that he would be lucky if he ate ten eggs.\n\nOllie was so ravenous that he found it difficult to control himself,\nand he made a bad impression by gulping the first egg as fast as he\ncould. A real eater would have let the egg slide down rapidly yet\ngently, without making an obvious effort. This uncontrolled, amateur\nspeed, thought the judges, could only lead to a stomachache.\n\nOllie devoured the second egg, the third, the fourth, and the rest of\nhis allotted ten. At that point, one of the judges asked, \"How do you\nfeel?\"\n\n\"Hungry.\"\n\n\"Stomach hurt?\"\n\n\"Only from hunger. It feels like it got nothin' in it. Somehow, them\neggs don't fill me up.\"\n\nSomebody in the audience laughed. The judges exchanged glances and\nordered more eggs brought on. From the crowd of watchers, cries of\nencouragement came to Ollie. At this stage, there was still nobody who\nthought that he had a chance.\n\nOllie proceeded to go through twenty eggs, forty, sixty, a hundred. By\nthat time, the judges and the crowd were in a state of unprecedented\nexcitement.\n\nAgain a judge demanded, \"How do you feel?\"\n\n\"Still hungry. They don't fill me up at all.\"\n\n\"But those are large eggs. Do you know how much a hundred of them\nweigh? Over fifteen pounds!\"\n\n\"I don't care how much they weigh. I'm still hungry.\"\n\n\"Do you mind if we weigh you?\"\n\n\"So long as you don't stop givin' me eggs, okay.\"\n\nThey brought out a scale and Ollie stepped on it. He weighed one\nhundred and thirty-nine pounds, on the nose.\n\nThen he started eating eggs again. At the end of his second hundred,\nthey weighed him once more. Ollie weighed one hundred thirty-eight and\nthree-quarters.\n\nThe judges stared at each other and then at Ollie. For a moment the\nentire audience sat in awed silence, as if watching a miracle. Then the\nmood of awe passed.\n\nOne of the judges said wisely, \"He palms them and slips them to a\nconfederate.\"\n\n\"Out here on the stage?\" demanded another judge. \"Where's his\nconfederate? Besides, you can see for yourself that he eats them. You\ncan watch them going down his throat.\"\n\n\"But that's impossible. If they really went down his throat, he'd gain\nweight.\"\n\n\"I don't know how he does it,\" admitted the other. \"But he does.\"\n\n\"The man is a freak. Let's get some doctors over here.\"\n\nOllie ate another hundred and forty-three eggs, and then had to stop\nbecause the restaurant ran out of them. The other contestants never\neven had a chance to get started.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen the doctor came and they told him the story, his first impulse\nseemed to be to grin. He knew a practical joke when he heard one. But\nthey put Ollie on the scales--by this time he weighed only a hundred\nthirty-eight and a quarter pounds--and fed him a two pound loaf of\nbread. Then they weighed him again.\n\nHe was an even one hundred and thirty-eight.\n\n\"At this rate, he'll starve to death,\" said the doctor, who opened his\nlittle black bag and proceeded to give Ollie a thorough examination.\n\nOllie was very unhappy about it because it interfered with his eating,\nand he felt more hungry than ever. But they promised to feed him\nafterward and, more or less unwillingly, he submitted.\n\n\"Bad teeth, enlarged heart, lesion on each lung, flat feet, hernia,\ndisplaced vertebrae--you name it and he has it,\" said the doctor.\n\"Where the devil did he come from?\"\n\nOllie was working on an order of roast beef and was too busy to reply.\n\nSomebody said, \"He's a rag-picker. I've seen him around.\"\n\n\"When did he start this eating spree?\"\n\nWith stuffed mouth, Ollie mumbled, \"Today.\"\n\n\"Today, eh? What happened today that makes you able to eat so much?\"\n\n\"I just feel hungry.\"\n\n\"I can see that. Look, how about going over to the hospital so we can\nreally examine you?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" said Ollie. \"You ain't pokin' no needles into me.\"\n\n\"No needles,\" agreed the doctor hastily. If there was no other way to\nget blood samples, they could always drug him with morphine and he'd\nnever know what had happened. \"We'll just look at you. And we'll feed\nyou all you can eat.\"\n\n\"All I can eat? It's a deal!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe humor was crude, but it put the point across--the photographer\nassigned to the contest had snapped a picture of Ollie in the middle of\ngulping two eggs. One was traveling down his gullet, causing a lump in\nhis throat, and the other was being stuffed into his mouth at the same\ntime. The caption writer had entitled the shot: THE MAN WHO BROKE\nTHE ICEBOX AT MONTE'S, and the column alongside was headed, Eats\nThree Hundred and Forty-three Eggs. \"I'm Hungry!\" He Says.\n\nZolto put the paper down. \"This is the one,\" he said to his wife.\n\"There can be no doubt that this person has found it.\"\n\n\"I knew it was no longer in the alley,\" said Pojim. Ordinarily a comely\nfemale, she was now deep in thought, and succeeded in looking beautiful\nand pensive at the same time. \"How are we to get it back without\nexciting unwelcome attention?\"\n\n\"Frankly,\" said Zolto, \"I don't know. But we'd better think of a way.\nHe must have mistaken it for a nut and swallowed it. Undoubtedly the\nhospital attendants will take X-rays of him and discover it.\"\n\n\"They won't know what it is.\"\n\n\"They will operate to remove it, and then they will find out.\"\n\nPojim nodded. \"What I don't understand,\" she said, \"is why it had this\neffect. When we lost it, it was locked.\"\n\n\"He must have opened it by accident. Some of these creatures, I have\nnoticed, have a habit of trying to crack nuts with their teeth. He must\nhave bitten on the proper switch.\"\n\n\"The one for inanimate matter? I think, Zolto, that you're right. The\nstomach contents are collapsed and passed into our universe through\nthe transfer. But the stomach itself, being part of a living creature,\ncannot pass through the same switch. And the poor creature continually\nloses weight because of metabolism. Especially, of course, when he\neats.\"\n\n\"Poor creature, you call him? You're too soft-hearted, Pojim. What do\nyou think we'll be if we don't get the transfer back?\"\n\nHe hunched up his shoulders and laughed.\n\nPojim said, \"Control yourself, Zolto. When you laugh, you don't look\nhuman, and you certainly don't sound it.\"\n\n\"What difference does it make? We're alone.\"\n\n\"You can never tell when we'll be overheard.\"\n\n\"Don't change the subject. What are we supposed to do about the\ntransfer?\"\n\n\"We'll think of a way,\" said Pojim, but he could see she was worried.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the hospital, they had put Ollie into a bed. They had wanted a nurse\nto bathe him, but he had objected violently to this indignity, and\nfinally they had sent in a male orderly to do the job. Now, bathed,\nshaven and wearing a silly little nightgown that made him ashamed to\nlook at himself, he was lying in bed, slowly starving to death.\n\nA dozen empty plates, the remains of assorted specialties of the\nhospital, filled with vitamins and other good things, lay around him.\nEverything had tasted fine while going down, but nothing seemed to have\nstuck to him.\n\nAll he could do was brood about the puzzled and anxious looks on the\ndoctors' faces when they examined him.\n\nThe attack came without warning. One moment Ollie was lying there\nunhappily, suffering hunger pangs, and the next moment somebody had\npunched him in the stomach. The shock made him start and then look\ndown. But there was nobody near him. The doctors had left him alone\nwhile they looked up articles in textbooks and argued with each other.\n\nHe felt another punch, and then another and another. He yelled in\nfright and pain.\n\nAfter five minutes, a nurse looked in and asked casually, \"Did you\ncall?\"\n\n\"My stomach!\" groaned Ollie. \"Somebody's hittin' me in my stomach!\"\n\n\"It's a tummyache,\" she said with a cheerful smile. \"It should teach\nyou not to wolf your food.\"\n\nThen she caught a glimpse of his stomach, from which Ollie, in his\nagony, had cast off the sheet, and she gulped. It was swollen like a\nwatermelon--or, rather, like a watermelon with great warts. Lumps stuck\nout all over it.\n\nShe rushed out, calling, \"Doctor Manson! Doctor Manson!\"\n\nWhen she returned with two doctors, Ollie was in such acute misery that\nhe didn't even notice them. One doctor said, \"Well, I'll be damned!\"\nand began tapping the swollen stomach.\n\nThe other doctor demanded, \"When did this happen?\"\n\n\"Right now, I guess,\" replied the nurse. \"Just a few minutes ago his\nstomach was as flat as the way it was when you saw it.\"\n\n\"We'd better give him a shot of morphine to put him out of his pain,\"\nsaid the first doctor, \"and then we'll X-ray him.\"\n\nOllie was in a semi-coma as they lifted him off his bed and wheeled him\ninto the X-ray room. He didn't hear a word of the ensuing discussion\nabout the photographs, although the doctors talked freely in front of\nhim--freely and profanely.\n\nIt was Dr. Manson who demanded, \"What in God's name are those things,\nanyway?\"\n\n\"They look like pineapples and grapefruit,\" replied the bewildered\nX-ray specialist.\n\n\"Square-edged pineapples? Grapefruit with one end pointed?\"\n\n\"I didn't say that's what they are,\" returned the other defensively. \"I\nsaid that's what they look like. The grapefruit could be eggplant,\" he\nadded in confusion.\n\n\"Eggplant, my foot. How the devil did they get into his stomach,\nanyway? He's been eating like a pig, but even a pig couldn't have\ngotten those things down its throat.\"\n\n\"Wake him up and ask him.\"\n\n\"He doesn't know any more than we do,\" said the nurse. \"He told me that\nit felt as if somebody was hitting him in the stomach. That's all he'd\nbe able to tell us.\"\n\n\"He's got the damnedest stomach I ever heard of,\" marveled Dr. Manson.\n\"Let's open it up and take a look at it from the inside.\"\n\n\"We'll have to get his consent,\" said the specialist nervously. \"I know\nit would be interesting, but we can't cut into him unless he's willing.\"\n\n\"It would be for his own good. We'd get that unsliced fruit salad out\nof him.\" Dr. Manson stared at the X-ray plates again. \"Pineapples,\ngrapefruit, something that looks like a banana with a small bush on\ntop. Assorted large round objects. And what looks like a nut. A small\nnut.\"\n\nIf Ollie had been aware, he might have told Dr. Manson that the nut\nwas the kernel of the trouble. As it was, all he could do was groan.\n\n\"He's coming to,\" said the nurse.\n\n\"Good,\" asserted Dr. Manson. \"Get a release, Nurse, and the minute he's\ncapable of following directions, have him sign it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the corridor outside, two white-clad interns stopped at the door of\nOllie's room and listened. They could not properly have been described\nas man and woman, but at any rate one was male and the other female. If\nyou didn't look at them too closely, they seemed to be human, which, of\ncourse, was what they wanted you to think.\n\n\"Just as I said,\" observed Zolto. \"They intend to operate. And their\nattention has already been drawn to the nut.\"\n\n\"We can stop them by violence, if necessary. But I abhor violence.\"\n\n\"I know, dear,\" Zolto said thoughtfully. \"What has happened is clear\nenough. He kept sending all that food through, and our people analyzed\nit and discovered what it was. They must have been surprised to\ndiscover no message from us, but after a while they arrived at the\nconclusion that we needed some of our own food and they sent it to us.\nIt's a good thing that they didn't send more of it at one time.\"\n\n\"The poor man must be in agony as it is.\"\n\n\"Never mind the poor man. Think of our own situation.\"\n\n\"But don't you see, Zolto? His digestive juices can't dissolve such\nunfamiliar chemical constituents, and his stomach must be greatly\nirritated.\"\n\nShe broke off for a moment as the nurse came past them, giving them\nonly a casual glance. The X-ray specialist followed shortly, his face\nreflecting the bewilderment he felt as a result of studying the plate\nhe was holding.\n\n\"That leaves only Dr. Manson with him,\" said Zolto. \"Pojim, I have a\nplan. Do you have any of those pandigestive tablets with you?\"\n\n\"I always carry them. I never know when in this world I'll run into\nsomething my stomach can't handle.\"\n\n\"Fine.\" Zolto stepped back from the doorway, cleared his throat, and\nbegan to yell, \"Calling Dr. Manson! Dr. Manson, report to surgery!\"\n\n\"You've been seeing too many of their movies,\" said Pojim.\n\nBut Zolto's trick worked. They heard Dr. Manson mutter, \"Damn!\" and saw\nhim rush into the corridor. He passed them without even noticing that\nthey were there.\n\n\"We have him to ourselves,\" said Zolto. \"Quick, the tablets.\"\n\nThey stepped into the room, where Zolto passed a small inhalator back\nand forth under Ollie's nose. Ollie jerked away from it, and his eyes\nopened.\n\n\"Take this,\" said Pojim, with a persuasive smile. \"It will ease your\npain.\" And she put two tablets into Ollie's surprised mouth.\n\nAutomatically, Ollie swallowed and the tablets sped down to meet the\ncollection in his stomach. Pojim gave him another smile, and then she\nand Zolto were out of the room.\n\nTo Ollie, things seemed to be happening in more and more bewildering\nfashion. No sooner had these strange doctors left than Dr. Manson came\nrushing back, cursing, in a way that would have shocked Hippocrates,\nthe unknown idiot who had summoned him to surgery. Then the nurse\ncame in, with a paper. Ollie gathered that he was being asked to sign\nsomething.\n\nHe shook his head vigorously. \"Not me. I don't sign _nothin'_, sister.\"\n\n\"It's a matter of life and death. Your own life and death. We have to\nget those things out of your stomach.\"\n\n\"No, sir, you're not cuttin' me open.\"\n\nDr. Manson gritted his teeth in frustration. \"You don't feel so much\npain now because of the morphine I gave you. But it's going to wear off\nin a few minutes and then you'll be in agony again. You'll have to let\nus operate.\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" repeated Ollie stubbornly. \"You're not cuttin' me open.\"\n\nAnd then he almost leaped from his bed. His already distended stomach\nseemed to swell outward, and before the astonished eyes of doctor and\nnurse, a strange new bump appeared.\n\n\"Help!\" yelled Ollie.\n\n\"That's exactly what we're trying to do,\" said Dr. Manson angrily.\n\"Only you won't let us. Now sign that paper, man, and stop your\nnonsense.\"\n\nOllie groaned and signed. The next moment he was being rushed into the\noperating room.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe morphine was wearing off rapidly, and he lay, still groaning, on\nthe table. From the ceiling, bright lights beat down upon him. Near his\nhead the anesthetist stood with his cone of sleep poised in readiness.\nAt one side a happy Dr. Manson was slipping rubber gloves on his\nantiseptic hands, while the attentive nurses and assistants waited.\n\nTwo interns were standing near the doorway. One of them, Zolto, said\nsoftly, \"We may have to use violence after all. They must not find it.\"\n\n\"I should have given him a third tablet,\" said Pojim, the other intern,\nregretfully. \"Who would have suspected that the action would be so\nslow?\"\n\nThey fell silent. Zolto slipped a hand into his pocket and grasped the\nweapon, the one he had hoped he wouldn't have to use.\n\nDr. Manson nodded curtly and said, \"Anesthetic.\"\n\nAnd then, as the anesthetist bent forward, it happened. Ollie's\nuncovered stomach, lying there in wait for the knife, seemed to heave\nand boil. Ollie shrieked and, as the assembled medicos watched in dazed\nfascination, the knobs and bumps smoothed out. The whole stomach began\nto shrink, like a cake falling in when some one has slammed the oven\ndoor. The pandigestive tablets had finally acted.\n\nOllie sat up. He forgot that he was wearing the skimpy and shameless\nnightgown, forgot, too, that he had a roomful of spectators. He pushed\naway the anesthetist who tried to stop him.\n\n\"I feel fine,\" he said.\n\n\"Lie down,\" ordered Dr. Manson sternly. \"We're going to operate and\nfind out what's wrong with you.\"\n\n\"You're not cuttin' into me,\" said Ollie. He swung his feet to\nthe floor and stood up. \"There ain't nothin' wrong with me. I feel\nwonderful. For the first time in my life I ain't hungry, and I'm\nspoilin' for trouble. Don't nobody try to stop me.\"\n\nHe started to march across the floor, pushing his way through the\nprotesting doctors.\n\n\"This way,\" said one of the interns near the door. \"We'll get your\nclothes.\" Ollie looked at her in suspicion, but she went on, \"Remember?\nI'm the one who gave you the tablets to make the pain go away.\"\n\n\"They sure worked,\" said Ollie happily, and allowed himself to be led\nalong.\n\nHe heard the uproar behind him, but he paid no attention. Whatever\nthey wanted, he was getting out of here, fast. There might have been\ntrouble, but at a critical point the public address system swung into\noperation, thanks to the foresight of his intern friends, who had\nrigged up a special portable attachment to the microphone. It started\ncalling Dr. Manson, calling Dr. Kolanyi, calling Dr. Pumber, and all\nthe others.\n\nIn the confusion, Ollie escaped and found himself, for the first time\nin his life, a passenger in a taxicab. With him were the two friendly\ninterns, no longer in white.\n\n\"Just in case any more of those lumps appear in your stomach,\" said\nthe female, \"you'd better take another couple of tablets.\"\n\nShe was so persuasive that Ollie put up only token resistance. The\ntablets went down his stomach, and then he settled back to enjoy the\ncab ride. It was only later that he wondered where they were taking\nhim. By that time, he was too sleepy to wonder very much.\n\nWith the aid of the first two tablets, he had digested the equivalent\nof a tremendous meal. The blood coursed merrily in his veins and\narteries, and he had a warm sensation of well-being.\n\nAs the taxi sped along, his eyes closed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You transmitted the message in one of the latter tablets?\" asked Zolto\nin their native tongue.\n\n\"I have explained all that has happened,\" replied his wife. \"They will\nstop sending food and wait for other directives.\"\n\n\"Good. Now we'll have to get the transfer out of him as soon as\npossible. We ourselves can operate and he will never be the wiser.\"\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Pojim. \"Once we have the transfer, it will only be a\nnuisance to us. We'll have to guard it carefully and be in continual\nfear of losing it. Perhaps it would be more sensible to leave it inside\nhim.\"\n\n\"Inside him? Pojim, my sweet, have you taken leave of your senses?\"\n\n\"Not at all. It is easier to guard a man than a tiny object. I took\na look at one of the X-ray plates, and it is clear that the transfer\nswitch has adhered to his stomach. It will remain there indefinitely.\nSuppose we focus a transpositor on that stomach of his. Then, as\nthe objects we want arrive from our own universe in their collapsed\ncondition, we can transpose them into our laboratory, enlarge them, and\nsend them off to Aldebaran, where they are needed.\"\n\n\"But suppose that he and that stomach of his move around!\"\n\n\"He will stay in one place if we treat him well. Don't you see, Zolto?\nHe is a creature who has always lacked food. We shall supply him such\nfood as his own kind have never dreamed of, complete with pandigestion\nfluid. At the same time, we shall set him to doing light work in order\nto keep him busy. Much of his task will involve studying and improving\nhimself. And at night we shall receive the things we need from our own\nuniverse.\"\n\n\"And when we have enough to supply the colony on Aldebaran II?\"\n\n\"Then it will be time enough to remove the transfer switch.\"\n\nZolto laughed. It was a laugh that would have been curiously out of\nplace in a human being, and if the taxi driver hadn't been so busy\nsteering his way through traffic, he would have turned around to look.\nPojim sensed the danger, and held up a warning finger.\n\nZolto subsided. \"You have remarkable ideas, my wife. Still, I see no\nreason why this should not work. Let us try it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOllie awoke to a new life. He was feeling better than he had ever\nfelt in his entire miserable existence. The two interns who had come\nalong with him had been transformed magically into a kindly lady and\ngentleman, who wished to hire him to do easy work at an excellent\nsalary. Ollie let himself be hired.\n\nHe had his choice of things to eat now, but, strangely enough, he no\nlonger had his old hunger. It was as if he were being fed from some\nhidden source, and he ate, one might almost have said, for the looks of\nit. The little he did consume, however, seemed to go a long way.\n\nHe gained weight, his muscles hardened, his old teeth fell out and new\nones appeared. He himself was astonished at this latter phenomenon, but\nafter his previous experience at the hospital, he kept his astonishment\nto himself. The spots on his lungs disappeared, his spine straightened.\nAfter a time he reached a weight of a hundred and ninety pounds, and\nhis eyes were bright and clear. At night he slept the sleep of the\njust--or the drugged.\n\nAt first he was happy. But after several months, there came a feeling\nof boredom. He sought out Mr. and Mrs. Zolto, and said, \"I'm sorry, I\ncan't stay here any longer.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked the lady.\n\n\"There's no room here, ma'am, for advancement,\" he said, almost\napologetically. \"I've been studyin' and I got ideas about things I can\ndo. All sorts of ideas.\"\n\nPojim and Zolto, who had planted the ideas, nodded solemnly.\n\nPojim said, \"We're glad to hear that, Ollie. The fact is that we\nourselves had decided to move to--to a warmer climate, some distance\naway from here. We were wondering how you'd get along without us.\"\n\n\"Don't you worry about me. I'll do fine.\"\n\n\"Well, that's splendid. But it would be convenient to us if you could\nwait till tomorrow. We'd like to give you something to remember us by.\"\n\n\"I'll be glad to wait, ma'am.\"\n\nThat night Ollie had a strange nightmare. He dreamed that he was on\nthe operating table again, and that the doctors and nurses were once\nmore closing in on him. He opened his mouth to scream, but no sound\ncame out. And then the two interns were there, once more wearing their\nuniforms.\n\nThe female said, \"It's all right. It's perfectly all right. We're just\nremoving the transfer switch. In the morning you won't even remember\nwhat happened.\"\n\nAnd, in fact, in the morning he didn't. He had only a vague feeling\nthat something _had_ happened.\n\nThey shook hands with him and they gave him a very fine letter of\nreference, in case he tried to get another job, and Mrs. Zolto\npresented him with an envelope in which there were several bills whose\nsize later made his eyes almost pop out of his head.\n\nHe walked down the street as if it belonged to him, or were going to.\nGone was the slouch, gone the bleariness of the eyes, gone the hangdog\nlook.\n\nGone was all memory of the dismal past.\n\nAnd then Ollie had a strange feeling. At first it seemed so peculiar\nthat he couldn't figure out what it was. It started in his stomach,\nwhich seemed to turn over and almost tie itself into a knot. He felt a\ntwinge of pain and winced almost perceptibly.\n\nIt took him several minutes to realize what it was.\n\nFor the first time in months, he was hungry.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Shipping Clerk, by William Morrison\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SHIPPING CLERK ***\n\n***** This file should be named 50796.txt or 50796.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/0/7/9/50796/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations.

Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
