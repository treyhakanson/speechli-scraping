Johnny, who wears different bodies the way ordinary\npeople wear clothes, is one of the most fascinating series characters in\nscience fiction._]\n\n\nWhen he reached Ophiuchus, Johnny Mayhem was wearing the body of an\nelderly Sirian gentleman.\n\nNothing could have been more incongruous. The Sirian wore a pince-nez, a\ndignified two-piece jumper in a charcoal color, sedate two-tone boots\nand a black string-tie.\n\nThe loiterers in the street near the Galactic Observer's building\nlooked, and pointed, and laughed. Using the dignity of the dead Sirian,\nwhose body he wore like other people wear clothing, Johnny Mayhem\nignored them. They had a point, of course. It was hot and humid on\nOphiuchus IX. The loiterers in the dusty, evil-smelling streets wore\nnothing but loin cloths.\n\nMayhem went inside the building, which was air-conditioned. Probably it\nwas the only air-conditioned structure on the entire planet. Mayhem\ndabbed at his Sirian forehead gratefully, mopping at sweat. As near as\nhe could figure, his life expectancy in this body was down to three\ndays, Earth style. He wondered fleetingly why the Galactic League had\nsent him here to Ophiuchus. He shrugged, knowing he would find out soon\nenough.\n\nThe Galactic Observer on Ophiuchus IX, a middle-aged Indian from Bombay\nnamed Kovandaswamy, wore an immaculate white linen loin cloth on his\nplump body and a relieved smile on his worried face when Mayhem entered\nhis office. The two men shook hands.\n\n\"So you're Mayhem?\" Kovandaswamy said in English. \"They told me to\nexpect you, sir. Pardon my staring, but I've never been face to face\nwith a legend before. I'm impressed.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMayhem laughed. \"You'll get over it.\"\n\n\"Well, at least as a Sirian gentleman, you're not very prepossessing.\nThat helps.\"\n\n\"It wasn't my idea. It never is.\"\n\n\"I know. I know that, sir.\" Kovandaswamy got up nervously from his desk\nand paced across the room. \"Do you know anything about Ophiuchus IX,\nMayhem?\"\n\n\"Not much. It's one of the Forgotten Worlds, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Precisely, sir. Ophiuchus IX is one of scores of interstellar worlds\ncolonized in the first great outflux from Earth.\"\n\n\"You mean during the population pressure of the 24th century?\"\n\n\"Exactly. Then Ophiuchus IX, like the other Forgotten Worlds, was all\nbut forgotten. As you know, Mayhem, the first flux of colonization\nreceded like a wave, inertia set in, and the so-called Forgotten Worlds\nbecame isolated from the rest of the galaxy for generations. Only in the\npast fifty years are we finding them again, one by one. Ophiuchus IX is\ntypical, isolated from the galaxy at large by a dust cloud that--\"\n\n\"I know. I came through it.\"\n\n\"It was colonized originally with Indians from southern and eastern\nIndia, on Earth. That's why the Galactic League appointed me Observer.\nI'm an Indian. These people--well, they're what my people might have\ndeveloped into if they'd lived for hundreds of years in perfect\nisolation.\"\n\n\"What's the trouble?\"\n\nKovandaswamy answered with a question of his own. \"You are aware of the\nGalactic League's chief aim?\"\n\n\"Sure. To see that no outworld, however small or distant, is left in\nisolation. Is that what you mean?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" agreed Kovandaswamy. \"Their reason is obvious. For almost a\nthousand years now the human race has outpaced its social and moral\ndevelopment with development in the physical sciences. For almost a\nthousand years mankind has had the power to destroy itself. In isolation\nthis is possible. With mutual interchange of ideas, it is extremely\nunlikely. Thus, in the interests of human survival, the Galactic League\ntries to thwart isolated development. So far, the Forgotten Worlds have\ncooperated. But Ophiuchus IX is an exception.\"\n\n\"And the League wants me to find out why?\"\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\n\"How are they thwarting--\"\n\nKovandaswamy was sweating despite the air-conditioning, despite his\nalmost-naked state. \"You have the right to turn this mission down, of\ncourse. The League told me that.\"\n\n\"I'm here,\" Mayhem said simply.\n\n\"Very well, sir. Sooner or later, every outworlder who ventures out\namong the Ophiuchans kills himself.\"\n\n\"I guess I didn't hear you. Did you say kills himself?\"\n\n\"Suicide, Mayhem. Exactly.\"\n\n\"But how can you blame--\"\n\n\"Like their ancestors from the Earthian sub-continent of India, Mayhem,\nthe Ophiuchans are mystics. The trance, the holy man who sits in\ncontemplation of his navel, the World Spirit--these are the things of\ntheir culture most important to them. Mayhem, did you ever see a hundred\nholy men of India working together?\"\n\n\"Usually they don't work together.\"\n\n\"Precisely, sir. Precisely. Here on Ophiuchus, they do. And not merely a\nhundred. All of them. Virtually all of them. Working together, their\nminds in trance, unified, seeking their World Spirit, they can do\namazing things.\"\n\n\"Like mentally forcing the outworlders to kill themselves?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Legally, they are innocent. Morally, they do not recognize\nthe outworlders as equals of themselves. The League wants to know what\nthey are trying to hide. It could be a threat to peace and--existence.\"\n\n\"You have a body for me?\" Johnny would be ready with that provided.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIf anyone but Johnny Mayhem had asked that question, Kovandaswamy would\nnot have known what he was talking about, or would have thought him\ninsane, or both. But Johnny Mayhem was, of course, the legandary Man\nWithout a Body. How many corporeal shells had he inhabited in the past\nhalf dozen years? He shrugged, not remembering. He couldn't remain in\none body more than a month: it would mean the final death of his _elan_,\nhis bodiless sentience. So far he had avoided that death.\n\nThe Galactic League would help him if it could. Every world which had a\nhuman population and a Galactic League post, however small, must have a\nbody in cold storage, waiting for Johnny Mayhem if his services were\nrequired. But no one knew exactly under what circumstances the Galactic\nLeague Council, operating from the hub of the Galaxy, might summon\nMayhem. And only a very few people, including those at the Hub and the\nGalactic League Firstmen on civilized worlds and Observers on primitive\nworlds, knew the precise mechanism of Mayhem's coming. To others it was\na weird mystery.\n\nJohnny Mayhem, bodiless sentience. Mayhem--Johnny Marlow then--who had\nbeen chased from Earth, a pariah and a criminal, almost seven years ago,\nwho had been mortally wounded on a wild planet deep within the\nSaggitarian Swarm, whose life had been saved--after a fashion--by the\nwhite magic of the planet. Mayhem, doomed now to possible immortality as\na bodiless sentience, an _elan_, which could occupy and activate a fresh\ncorpse or one which had been frozen properly ... an _elan_ doomed to\nwander eternally because it could not remain in one body for more than a\nmonth without body and _elan_ perishing. Mayhem, who had dedicated his\nstrange, lonely life to the service of the Galactic League because a\nnormal life and normal social relations were not possible for him....\n\n\"Then you'll do it?\" Kovandaswamy asked on Ophiuchus IX. \"Even though\nyou realize we can give you no official help not only because the\nGalactic League approves of your work unofficially but can't sanction it\nofficially, but because an outworlder can't set his foot outside this\nbuilding for long or off the spacefield without risking death....\"\n\n\"By suicide?\"\n\n\"Yes. I'm practically a prisoner in Galactic League Headquarters, as is\nmy staff. You see--\"\n\n\"What about the body?\"\n\nKovandaswamy looked at him nervously. \"A native, Mayhem. A native won't\nbe molested, you see.\"\n\n\"That figures. What kind of native?\"\n\n\"In top shape, sir. Healthy, young, in the prime of life you might say.\"\n\n\"Then what's bothering you?\"\n\n\"Nothing. Nothing, sir.\"\n\n\"Your technicians are ready?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. And vowed to secrecy.\"\n\nMayhem found a tiny capsule in the pocket of his Sirian jumper, and\npopped it in his mouth.\n\n\"What--what's that?\" Kovandaswamy asked.\n\nMayhem swallowed. \"Curare,\" he said.\n\n\"Curare! A poison!\"\n\n\"Paralysis,\" said Mayhem quickly. \"Muscular paralysis. You die because\nyou stop breathing. Painless ... and....\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Call your technicians ... new body ... ready....\" Gasping, the Sirian\ngentleman, hardly Johnny Mayhem now, fell to the floor.\n\nTrembling, Kovandaswamy pressed a button on his desk. A few moments\nlater, two white-coated technicians entered the office.\n\n\"Project M,\" Kovandaswamy said.\n\nGrimly the technicians went to work.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMayhem awoke.\n\nOrdinarily it was his _elan_ alone which journeyed between the worlds,\nhis _elan_ which was fed the information it would need in hypno-sleep\nwhile the frozen body was thawed out. Sometimes, however, he came the\nnormal way in a body which still had some of its thirty days left, as he\nhad come to Ophiuchus IX in the Sirian gentleman.\n\nDarkness. The body felt young and healthy. Mayhem wondered vaguely how\nit had died, then decided it did not really matter. For the next thirty\ndays the body would live again, as Johnny Mayhem.\n\nRecessed lighting glowed at the juncture of walls and ceiling. Mayhem\nwas reclining on a cot. A loin cloth and a large shawl had been laid out\nfor him. On the far wall of the room was a tinted mirror. Mayhem got up\nand went over there.\n\nWhat his new body looked like hardly mattered, he told himself. Youth,\nhealth, strength--these were important. He could sense them internally.\nHe could....\n\nHe stared at the image in the mirror. His face turned beet red. He went\nfor the shawl and the loin cloth and put them on. Cursing, he went to\nfind Kovandaswamy.\n\n\"Is this supposed to be a joke?\" Mayhem demanded.\n\n\"You never asked what the--\" Kovandaswamy began.\n\n\"How am I supposed to find out anything--like this?\"\n\n\"It's a young body, a healthy body. It is also the one we were given\nwhen the Galactic League first came here. It is the only one we were\ngiven.\"\n\n\"Take it or leave it, eh?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid so, Mayhem.\"\n\n\"All right. All right, I guess I shouldn't complain. It could probably\noutrun and outfight and outthink the dyspeptic old Sirian gentleman, and\nthings turned out well enough on Sirius III. But it'll probably take\nmost of my time just getting used to it, Kovandaswamy. I'm supposed to\nbe conducting an investigation.\"\n\n\"At least as an Ophiuchan you won't arouse suspicion.\"\n\nMayhem nodded slowly, with reluctance. There was nothing else to say. He\nshook hands with Kovandaswamy and, wearing the loin cloth and the shawl,\nleft the Galactic League building.\n\nWith, of course, a completely new identity.\n\nMayhem walked a mile and a half through hot, arid country. The League\nbuilding was isolated, as if its inmates might contaminate the native\nOphiuchans. Along the dusty road Mayhem passed a _guru_, the name for a\nwise man or a holy man first in India and now here on Ophiuchus IX. The\nguru sat in contemplation of the tip of his nose, legs crossed, soles of\nfeet up, eyes half-closed. The guru remained that way, without moving,\nuntil Mayhem was out of sight. Then the guru behaved in a very\nun-guru-like manner.\n\nThe guru got up quite nimbly, joints creaking, skin dry and cracked.\nThree strides brought him to a tree with a partly hollow trunk. He\nlifted a radio transmitter and began to talk.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn twenty generations, the initially small population of Ophiuchus IX,\nall colonists from India on Earth, had increased geometrically. The\ncolonized planet, now, was as over-populated as the teeming\nsub-continent which long ago had sent the colonists seeking a new home.\nAs a result, unemployment was chronic, discontent widespread, and\nwhatever inner serenity mysticism might bring was widely sought after.\nThis did not stop the non-mystics, however, of whom there were many,\nfrom seeking jobs that could pay money that could fill empty bellies....\n\n[Illustration: The crazed mob was bent upon rapine and murder.]\n\nA long line gathered outside the employment office of Denebian Exports\nthe morning after Mayhem had left the League building in his new body.\nDenebian Exports was the largest outworld company currently on\nOphiuchus, a company which had solved the outworlder-suicide problem\nquite simply by hiring no one but natives. Still, hoots and catcalls\nsurrounded those on the employment line. Other jobless Ophiuchans,\napparently preferring near-starvation to working for the outworlders,\nthreatened to make the situation dangerous.\n\nPandit Gandhi Menon, a lean, handsome Ophiuchan of perhaps thirty years,\nwished there was some way he could shut his ears to the abuse. He needed\nwork. His father and mother were ill, his child was starving, his wife\nalready dead. The gurus offered their own unique solution, of course.\nThe body is nothing, they said. The mind is everything. But thus had the\ngurus spoken for four thousand years, on Earth and on Ophiuchus. The\ngreat majority of Ophiuchans, Pandit Gandhi Menon included, preferred\nfood for the body to food for mystic thought. Still, the crowds were\nugly, threatening to break up the line of job-seekers if Denebian\nExports didn't open its doors soon....\n\nAn unkempt little man, not old but with a matted growth of beard, an\nunwashed body which gave the impression of wiry strength, and wild eyes,\nabruptly flung himself at the young woman in line in front of Pandit.\n\nShouting, \"Not our women, too!\" the little man attacked the girl, trying\nto drag her from the line. \"It is bad enough our men, but not our\nwomen!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPandit caught the fanatic's wiry arm and brought it behind his scrawny\nback in a hammerlock. \"Leave her alone,\" he said. \"If you try that\nagain, I'll break your arm.\"\n\nThe fanatic looked at Pandit with hate in his eyes, but stepped back and\nstood to one side mouthing invective.\n\nThe girl, who was about twenty-five years old, had a livid mark on her\narm. She wore loin cloth and shawl, the usual garb. She was, Pandit\nobserved for the first time, quite pretty.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she said. \"I--I'm not sure I like working for the\noutworlders. But I need the money.\"\n\n\"Don't we all,\" Pandit told her. \"But we're not hired yet. I am Pandit\nGandhi Menon.\"\n\n\"Sria Krishna,\" the girl said, smiling at him. \"What sort of work is\nit?\"\n\n\"Don't you know, Sria Krishna?\"\n\nThe girl shook her head and Pandit said: \"Actually, I guess I don't\nknow, either. But there are rumors the outworlders want jet-pilots. Not\nfor rocketry. For jets. To fly to the Empty Places.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The Empty Places? Why?\"\n\nPandit shrugged. \"Because they are empty, perhaps. Because they are too\ndry and too arid to support life. Because Denebian Export can claim\nwhatever it found there, for free export. So go the rumors. But surely\nyou can't pilot a jet.\"\n\n\"Can you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Pandit said promptly with a faint show of pride.\n\n\"My father taught me. I want to thank you for what--\"\n\n\"Nothing. Anyone in my position would have done it. This rabble--\"\n\nThe rabble was still noisy. Occasionally they hurled offal at the\nstragglers joining the rear of the long line. But Pandit and Sria\nKrishna stood in the forefront, and presently the door opened. In a few\nminutes Pandit watched the girl disappear inside. He waited nervously,\nlicking dry lips with a parched tongue. It was early morning, but\nalready very hot. He needed the work. Any work. He needed the money\nwhich outworlders could pay so abundantly for honest work. He wondered\nif the fanatic gurus ever thought of that. Then the door in front of him\nopened again and a fat, unctuous-looking Ophiuchan came out. He seemed\nto be an official of sorts.\n\n\"One more!\" he said. \"Only one! The rest of you begone.\"\n\nBehind Pandit there was a general press of bodies, but he was first in\nline and did not surrender his position. The unctuous-looking man\nadmitted him, half-expecting a bribe. Pandit passed him by; he didn't\nhave a single copper.\n\nHe approached a desk. The crowd noise outside was loud, those who had\nnot joined the line crowing because most of those on it had been turned\naway. Behind the desk sat a small Denebian man of middle years. He\nlooked nervous.\n\n\"Can you fly?\" he asked in a voice almost desperately thin.\n\n\"Yes,\" Pandit said. Then the rumors were right.\n\n\"How much experience?\"\n\n\"Five years on and off.\"\n\n\"You have a license?\"\n\n\"There are no licenses on Ophiuchus IX,\" Pandit pointed out.\n\n\"Yes, of course. I'm sorry. Habit. You people don't lie.\"\n\n\"We try not to.\"\n\n\"Your name?\"\n\nPandit told him. The Denebian wrote it down on a form and said: \"You'll\ndo. Pay is twenty credits a mission.\" It wasn't much, but it was more\nthan Pandit had expected.\n\n\"What do we fly?\" he asked. Questions didn't seem welcome, but no harm\ntrying.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Denebian looked at him and laughed. \"You want the job?\"\n\n\"Yes, I want the job.\"\n\n\"Then don't ask questions.\"\n\nPandit nodded.\n\n\"Out through that door, then. The other new pilots are assembling.\"\n\nAnd Pandit left the small office.\n\nA moment later a buzzer sounded on the Denebian's desk. He spoke into a\ngrid: \"Orkap here. Go ahead.\"\n\n\"The guru near the League building reports that a native Ophiuchan left\nthe building heading for the city.\"\n\n\"When was this?\"\n\n\"Yesterday morning.\"\n\n\"And?\"\n\n\"Draw your own conclusions. Natives don't go near the League\nheadquarters as a rule, do they?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"And the League, of course, will want to know about the suicides?\"\n\n\"Yes, but--\"\n\n\"But nothing,\" said the radio voice, which belonged to the only other\nDenebian currently on Ophiuchus IX. \"We can assume this native is a spy.\nFor the League, Orkap.\"\n\n\"All right. I don't see any need to worry, though.\"\n\n\"Don't you? The gurus, like the other natives, can sham, but they can't\nlie. Sooner or later a guru will be brought out of trance by the League,\nquestioned, and--\"\n\n\"Tell them about us?\" Orkap asked in a shocked voice.\n\n\"It could happen. Maybe it's happened already. There won't be any proof,\nof course, but the League would send a spy. Suppose I describe this\nnative to you.\"\n\nOrkap said, \"Go ahead,\" and the radio voice did so.\n\nIn a shocked voice Orkap admitted: \"I've given that Ophiuchan a pilot's\njob this morning. There can't be any doubt about it.\"\n\n\"Ah, then you see? You see?\"\n\n\"I can fix that. I can--\"\n\n\"Orkap, Orkap. You'll do nothing now. Let the spy alone for now. Then,\nin the Empty Places, you will merely announce to the pilots that there\nis a spy among them. Don't reveal who it is.\" He could not believe his\nears.\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"They want work. They need work. They'll all be afraid the finger of\nguilt may point at them. They'll work like dogs for you, and I wouldn't\nbe surprised if they uncovered the spy themselves.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Orkap said. \"Yes, I understand.\"\n\n\"All but one thing, Orkap. There is one thing you don't understand. The\nspy's identity--\"\n\n\"You already told me who the spy was.\"\n\n\"Yes. But there is another spy. Working for us, in the League building.\"\n\n\"I never knew,\" said Orkap.\n\n\"The spy among your pilots is more than appearance indicates. Did you\never hear of Johnny Mayhem?\"\n\nOrkap's heart jumped into his throat. Who in the galaxy hadn't heard of\nMayhem? \"But,\" he gasped, \"a--\"\n\n\"Nevertheless. It is Mayhem.\"\n\nOrkap was suddenly afraid, more afraid than he had ever been in his\nlife. The ubiquitous Mayhem.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe fierce white sun of Ophiuchus IX broiled down on the Empty Places, a\nfeatureless desert two-thousand miles across and as lividly white as\nbleached bone. In all that burning emptiness, the jet cargo craft looked\nvery small and very insignificant, like black midges on the dead white\nsand.\n\nMidges among midges, the new pilots walked.\n\nOne said: \"But I see no cargo.\"\n\nAnother: \"These outworlders and their mystery....\"\n\nAll were sweating, all uncomfortable, but all grateful for the twenty\ncredits a flight they would earn, whatever the cargo turned out to be.\n\n\"What do you think?\" Pandit asked Sria.\n\n\"I think I've never been so hot in my life. I feel like I'm being\nbroiled alive.\"\n\n\"Here comes the Denebian now.\"\n\nThey had been driven into the Empty Places in a sand sled. The trip had\ntaken two days but because the sled was air-conditioned no one had\nobjected. When they saw the half dozen jets they knew why a sled had\ntaken them into the wilderness. The jets were small cargo-carriers with\nroom for pilot, co-pilot and perhaps a ton of cargo in each. Whatever it\nwas the Denebians wanted exported, it didn't take up much room.\n\nOrkap of Deneb walked toward them past the first of the jets. He began\nwithout preamble: \"Your cargo is packed and ready to be moved in an\nunderground vault five hundred yards from here. You will break up into\npairs, a pilot and co-pilot for each jet.\" Sria Krishna and Pandit had\nalready paired themselves together. \"You work on your own time, getting\nthe cargo with trundle-sleds, loading it, taking off, delivering it to\nthe Denebian freighter at the spaceport. When you are finished, you\ncollect your pay.\"\n\n\"Where do we sleep?\" someone asked.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOrkap smiled. \"You didn't come out here to sleep. There is only a\nlimited amount of cargo. The jets are swift. You will be paid according\nto the amount of work you do. Any other questions?\"\n\n\"What about food?\" a plump young Ophiuchan asked.\n\n\"You will be given energy tablets, as many as you wish. Any other\nquestions? No? Good. I have two additional things to say. First, you are\nnot to examine your cargo under any circumstances, either here, or in\ntransit, or on the spacefield. There are televid pick-up units in each\njet, so you will be watched at all times. Second--\" Orkap paused and let\nthe silence grow and spread across the dazzling white expanse--\"there is\na spy among you, wearing the body of an Ophiuchan but in reality--well,\nI don't have to tell you who he is in reality.\" Orkap smiled grimly.\n\"There is only one body-changer in the galaxy, but one is quite enough.\"\n\nOne of the pilots said, a little breathlessly: \"Johnny Mayhem!\"\n\nOrkap smiled again. \"I am aware of Mayhem's identity,\" he said, \"but I'm\nnot going to do anything about it.\"\n\nThe pilots waited. The sun glared down balefully. \"You see,\" Orkap told\nthem, \"we cannot be altogether sure that the rest of you are here simply\nto earn your twenty credits a flight. Mayhem has unwittingly become our\ninsurance. Find Mayhem! Find the spy among you! A hundred credits bonus\nto the man who does!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPandit looked at Sria, who whistled. The girl said: \"If they think we\ncan finish the job without sleep, picking up cargo and flying it to the\nspaceport and returning for more, then a hundred credits is probably\nmore than any of us will earn. They'll all be looking like hawks for\nthis Mayhem.\"\n\n\"And,\" Pandit agreed, \"if there's a native spy among them, he'd be\nafraid to show himself for fear they'll think he's Mayhem. Very clever\nof the Denebians.\"\n\n\"... to work at once,\" Orkap was saying. He wore a blaster on his hip,\nthe only weapon among them. They all trudged behind him through the\nburning, faceless sands. Soon they reached a depression from which the\nsand had been cleared, baring the white bedrock of the Empty Places. In\nthe rock a square opening had been cut, shielded on each side from the\nshifting sands by an up-curving lip. A ramp led down into darkness.\n\n\"You will find your cargo down there. Also enough trundle-sleds to go\naround,\" Orkap explained. \"The cargo is crated. The crates must remain\nintact. Is that understood?\"\n\nIt was understood.\n\nTheir sudden mutual suspicion a pall worse than the heat, the Ophiuchans\ndescended the ramp. They needed the money or they wouldn't be here. The\nmoney meant more to them than anything: this was no time to be\nfar-sighted. Yet one of them was a spy for the Galactic League--Johnny\nMayhem.\n\nOne of them, but which?\n\nPandit made a quick estimate of the number of crates. They were stacked\nneatly against one wall, each about four feet by four by four. And from\nthe size of them, a single crate would fill the cargo bay of each of the\njets. Pandit made a rough estimate. Two dozen crates, perhaps. In the\ndim light it was hard to tell. Two dozen crates, six jets, twelve\nOphiuchans. Four trips for each jet. A half hour to load, ten minutes to\nunload, an hour and a half by jet to the spacefield. Three hours and\nforty minutes, round trip. Say, four hours. Four times four, sixteen.\nSixteen hours of steady work for eighty credits. No time for mystery or\nsuspicion. Barely time for mistrust....\n\n\"You, there!\" a voice called. \"What are you doing?\"\n\nIt was one of the other Ophiuchans, quite the biggest of the lot. Pandit\nhad seen him outside and remembered his name. He was Raj Shiva, a tall,\nmuscular, swarthy Ophiuchan, with small, alert, suspicious eyes and a\nlivid scar alongside his jaw.\n\n\"Nothing,\" Pandit said. \"Nothing.\"\n\n\"No? The others are loading already. I'll be watching you.\"\n\nFor a hundred credits, Pandit thought furiously, but said nothing. Sria\ntouched his shoulder. \"I have one of the trundle-sleds,\" she said.\n\"Let's get about it.\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Pandit.\n\nRaj Shiva watched them a few moments longer, then drifted away with his\nown partner. It took Pandit and Sria, sweating copiously in the\ntremendous heat, a few minutes less than half an hour to load one of the\ncrates aboard their jet. Three of the other ships were already airborne,\nwhining away toward the spacefield.\n\nPandit looked at the crate. There were no markings on it anywhere. The\nwood looked new, but that meant absolutely nothing. In the dry heat of\nthe Empty Places, wood would last a century, a millennium. They could\nnot tell how old it was.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Ready?\" Sria Krishna called from the controls.\n\nPandit had secured the crate in the cargo bay. \"Ready,\" he responded.\n\nMoments later acceleration thrust them back in the twin pilot seats.\n\nSria leveled the jet at twenty thousand and they sped at eight hundred\nmiles an hour toward the city and the spacefield just beyond it.\n\n\"Do you wonder about it?\" Sria asked after a while.\n\n\"About what?\"\n\n\"The cargo.\"\n\n\"We aren't supposed to.\"\n\n\"I know.\" Sria laughed. \"I'm a woman, you see.\"\n\nPandit grinned at her. \"Curiosity,\" he said. \"A woman's trait on any\nworld.\"\n\nSria got up from the pilot chair but Pandit placed his hand on her\nshoulder and gently shoved her down again. \"They have a televid unit\naboard,\" he said, \"remember?\"\n\nSria nodded. The jet sped on.\n\nThey landed at the spacefield. They were the fourth jet down and one of\nthe other three had taken off on the return leg of the flight. A\nDenebian Pandit had never seen before was supervising the loin-cloth\ngarbed laborers loading the crates aboard a Denebian spaceship. With\nSria he delivered their crate on the trundle-sled, returned with the\nsled to their jet, and took off.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJust short of four hours from the time they started they returned to the\nEmpty Places. They had gained a little time and were the second team\ndown. From the jet ahead of them, Raj Shiva led a puny, middle-aged\nco-pilot.\n\nOrkap stood in the underground storage room. Looking at his wrist chrono\nhe said to the four Ophiuchans who came down the ramp: \"You made fine\ntime.\" Raj Shiva's puny companion said something, but Raj Shiva grabbed\nhis arm and they began to load a second crate. Pandit and Sria loaded\ntheirs in silence.\n\nThey made their second round trip in four hours exactly. It was\ncompletely dark when they returned to the Empty Places. Sria was worried\nthey would overshoot the cargo point, but Pandit brought the little jet\ndown within a few hundred yards of its takeoff point.\n\nThey could see nothing when they shut off the jet's running lights,\nexcept for the glow which came from the underground room. They reached\nit and went down the ramp. Pandit judged that half the crates were gone\nnow. He took a quick tour of the dimly-lit room while Sria got the\ntrundle-sled into position against one of the crates.\n\n\"Nobody here,\" Pandit said in a whisper. \"The Denebian must be sleeping\nin the sand-sled.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Sria said a little breathlessly.\n\n\"I was thinking--\"\n\n\"What?\" Sria said. \"Don't stop.\"\n\n\"If we wanted to examine one of the boxes, it would be suicide to open\nthe one we take. But we could open one of them down here, see what it\nis, take another for ourselves--\"\n\n\"You would do this?\" Sria asked him. \"Why?\"\n\nPandit shrugged. \"I have eyes,\" he said. \"Our gurus did not broadcast\nthe death-wish to outworlders until the Denebians came. Then they\nstarted. Have the Denebians sold them on the idea?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Sria said.\n\n\"Well, let's assume they have. Why? Why would they do such a thing,\nSria?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Let me get this straight, Pandit. First, you think the gurus actually\nare making the outworlders kill themselves?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Pandit said. \"It's mental suggestion, on a scale only our\ngurus are capable of. But don't you see, Sria, they wouldn't do it on\ntheir own. The gurus are dirty, careless about their bodies--but\nterribly arrogant. Left alone, they wouldn't think the outworlders\nimportant enough to be concerned over one way or another. They certainly\nwouldn't kill them.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" Sria urged.\n\n\"All right. The gurus have great knowledge of the mystical, but\nexternally they're naive. Let's suppose someone came along--the\nDenebians in this case--and found something they wanted very badly on\nOphiuchus. These crates here, Sria. What would they do? They'd go to the\ngurus and convince them--it wouldn't be difficult--that any intercourse\nwith outworlders would be harmful to Ophiuchus, that the outworlders\nwant to colonize and exploit our world, that sort of thing. While the\ngurus are stewing it over, the Denebians could have prepared this\nshipment here--whatever it is--for departure. But the gurus, too well\nconvinced by them, could have acted sooner than they expected, making it\nall but impossible for the small handful of outworlders, the Denebians\namong them, to go abroad without fear of taking their own lives. Perhaps\na few, like Orkap and that other Denebian, are not at all suicide-prone.\nPerhaps a few can withstand it. As for the rest, it's indoors and away\nfrom the mental influence of the gurus, or off Ophiuchus entirely. Which\nwould leave the Denebians with a problem they hadn't thought of.\" His\nwords made sense.\n\n\"Yes!\" cried Sria excitedly. \"Now that they have their valuable cargo\nready to go, how can they get it off Ophiuchus without help?\"\n\n\"We,\" said Pandit softly, \"are that help.\"\n\nSria asked: \"What are you going to do about it?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I honestly don't. I never had anything against the\noutworlders. How could I? We're all progeny of outworlders who came here\nalmost five hundred years ago from a place called India on Earth. But\nthe gurus--\"\n\n\"--have been deceived. You said so yourself.\"\n\nPandit was sweating, and it was more than the heat which made him sweat.\nHe paced up to the crates, then back again, then to the crates. Suddenly\nhe said, \"All right. All right, I'll do it. Someone's got to find out\nwhat the Denebians want here.\"\n\nAnd Pandit began to pry at one of the boxes with a knife he carried in\nhis loin cloth. Sria said, \"I'll keep watch. You call me when it's\nopened.\"\n\n\"Maybe you ought to get out of here. In case anything happens, I don't\nwant to get you involved.\"\n\nBut Sria went up the ramp and crouched there, waiting, watching. The\ndesert was very quiet, entirely windless, and hot even at night. Stars\nsprinkled the sky overhead and far off she thought she heard the distant\nwhine of a jet. \"Hurry,\" she called. From below she heard the sound of\nwood being pried away from wood. She heard, or imagined she heard, the\njet coming closer. \"Hurry!\" she called softly.\n\nFinally three words drifted up to her. \"Come here, Sria.\" She felt a\nlittle relieved. Now that he'd finished.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe listened for the jet. Now she heard nothing. She went swiftly down\nthe ramp.\n\nPandit stood before one of the crates, perspiring freely. He had pried\nloose one of the side walls and a smooth metal surface with stenciled\nlettering on it was exposed.\n\nHe said: \"I can't read that. It's a language I never saw before.\"\n\nSria bent closer and looked at the stenciled lettering. A voice, not\nPandit's, said:\n\n\"I thought it would be you two.... No, don't move!\"\n\nA big muscular figure silhouetted against the starlight, and a smaller,\npuny, thin-legged figure. Raj Shiva and his co-pilot.\n\n\"A hundred credits each, Handus,\" Raj Shiva said as he ran down the\nramp. \"Can you keep the girl from getting away?\"\n\nHandus rushed down at his heels.\n\nPandit met Raj Shiva at the foot of the ramp. Pandit was a big man by\nOphiuchan standards, but Raj Shiva was bigger. \"Run, Sria!\" Pandit\ncried, and met the giant with his knife.\n\nRaj Shiva parried the blow with his forearm, then his big hands moved\nswiftly and the knife clattered to the floor. Sria ran for the ramp, her\nbare feet padding swiftly against the stone floor. Handus was waiting\nfor her at the foot of the ramp in an awkward crouch. She had a glimpse\nof Raj Shiva and Pandit straining together, then Handus struck her with\nhis balled fist. It was a puny blow, but Sria staggered back, her jaw\nnumb. Laughing shrilly, Handus leaped at her. She was shoved back,\ntripped over something, and fell. For a moment all the lights blinked\nout inside her head.\n\nInside--no! Raj Shiva and Pandit stumbled about the room, struck\nsomething, there was a loud popping sound, a tinkling, and the lights in\nthe storage room went out.\n\n\"Where is she?\" Handus called. \"I can't find her!\"\n\nShe heard him groping about, heard the others struggling together. She\ngot to her feet and stood perfectly still, waiting for anything. She\nwished she had a weapon--something--she was only a woman--\n\nThen a voice whispered: \"Hurry, Sria! Hurry!\"\n\n\"Pandit?\"\n\nHe took her arm in the darkness. She couldn't see him. They went to the\ncrates and wrestled one on their trundle-sled.\n\n\"Not the open one?\" Sria gasped.\n\n\"No. No.\"\n\nThey heard footsteps.... Saw a figure for a moment silhouetted against\nstarlight. Handus was fleeing, probably for help.\n\nThey took their sled out into the night and dragged it across the sand\ntoward their waiting jet. They loaded the crate in the cargo bay. While\nPandit was finishing the job in the darkness, Sria sat down at the\ncontrols.\n\n\"Ready?\" she shouted above the whine of the jets.\n\nPandit said that he was. She hardly heard his voice.\n\nA moment later, she took the small cargo jet up.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe heard Pandit moving in the small cabin behind her. She said: \"We\nought to take it to the League authorities, don't you think?\" She had to\nshout to be heard above the whining roar of the jets.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I was able to read the writing. It's Procyonian, Pandit. Do you know\nanything about the Procyonians?\"\n\n\"Well, a few centuries ago, they were the most warlike people in the\ngalaxy. It was rumored they had a cache of thermonuclear bombs hidden\nsomewhere, after such weapons were outlawed in the twenty-fifth century.\nThe cache was never found, until tonight. We found it, Pandit.\"\n\n\"But Orkap and--\"\n\n\"That's true. It was found by the Denebians first. Don't you see,\nPandit? Orkap and the others, private Denebian traders. It wasn't the\ngovernment. It never is the government these days. But unscrupulous\nindividuals, Pandit, armed with two dozen hydrogen bombs--why, they\ncould take over their own world on threat of imminent destruction, or\nsome outworld plum they had their eye on, or--\"\n\n\"I see.\" Pandit's voice was barely audible above the whine of the jets.\n\n\"It's a job the Galactic League can handle,\" Sria went on. \"Now that\nit's out in the open--or will be as soon as we get to the spacefield.\nYou've done your work, Pandit, and your people won't forget you for it.\nAs for me, my work here is finished too.\"\n\n\"Your work?\"\n\nAbove the roar of the jet, Sria shouted: \"Yes. I am Johnny Mayhem.\" She\nsmiled in the darkness. Johnny Mayhem, she thought, in a girl's body.\nWell, he'd been young men and old, weak and strong, sick and healthy,\nhuman and alien outworlder--so why not a girl too?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll at once Pandit's hand lay heavily on her shoulder. She turned around\nand in the darkness but with the lights of the instrument board on it\nsaw the gleam of a knife blade. The face beyond the blade, leering from\ndarkness, was not Pandit's. She hadn't actually known it was Pandit. She\nhadn't seen him. She'd hardly been able to hear his voice.\n\nIt was Raj Shiva.\n\n\"Fly us to Denebian Exports,\" he said, \"or I'll kill you and do it\nmyself.\"\n\n\"You're making a mistake. Your people belong with the Galactic League,\nnot with a handful of adventurers who--\"\n\n\"The Denebians are right,\" Raj Shiva said fanatically. \"My people would\nbe better off left alone.\"\n\n\"I'm flying this jet to the spaceport--and the League.\"\n\n\"I'll kill you. I know all about you, Mayhem. You're not a woman,\nreally. You're not even a native. That's a dead body, isn't it? But if I\nkill it--again--while you're in it, you die to. You'll do what I say!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis very night, unless something was done about it, the cache of\nthermonuclear weapons would be space-bound, the first hydrogen bombs\nloose in the galaxy for almost five hundred years. Wouldn't mankind ever\nbegin to learn? Mayhem-Sria thought wearily. He knew the answer, of\ncourse: most men would, but the few who refused could bring destruction\nto an entire galaxy....\n\nMoments before, apparent success of a mission. Now, failure. Or death.\nOr both.\n\nSria's hand flashed out suddenly and struck the instrument board. The\njet plummeted earthward with a loud whining sound. Sria felt herself\nshoved back by the tremendous acceleration into the cushions of the\npilot chair. She heard a wild exclamation from Raj Shiva, but couldn't\nturn around to see what had happened. Grim-lipped, she kept the ship\nhurtling Earthward. She knew it was dangerous and might even prove\ndisastrous. Her body could take so much, then she would black out. But\nif she didn't maintain the dive until the last possible instant, Raj\nShiva would get control of the ship and its vital cargo. She was only a\ngirl, but she was protected by the crash-padding of the pilot chair. Raj\nShiva, unprotected, was behind her somewhere....\n\nDown through the thin upper atmosphere of Ophiuchus IX screamed the\nsmall ship, its heat-dial blinking on and off in warning as friction\nscorched its thin shell. The scream of air became more deep-throated as\nthe atmosphere became thicker....\n\nTen thousand feet.\n\nEight thousand.\n\nSix.\n\nSria's eyes saw black. Her breath was labored. Needles of pain darted in\nher skull, plucked at her eyes. She opened her mouth to scream but heard\nnothing. She felt as if she must be forced clear through the protective\ncushions of the pilot chair.\n\nFive thousand feet.\n\nFour thousand.\n\nBlackness and peace and a settling lassitude....\n\nThree thousand feet.\n\nWith hands that would barely function, Sria with supreme effort brought\nthe jet out of its death-dive. She slumped in the pilot chair for a long\ntime, too weak to do anything else.\n\nThen she looked back at Raj Shiva.\n\nWho lay slack and unconscious against the rear bulkhead of the cargo\nship.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMayhem-Sria brought the jet down and, middle of the night or no, saw\nKovandaswamy. Raj Shiva was taken into custody. A jet was sent out,\nloaded with Leaguemen who had proved immune to the guru death-wish and\nall armed to the teeth. It landed at the cache and stood guard over it.\nPandit was found, unconscious, one of his arms broken, but otherwise all\nright. A second jet prevented the Denebian Export ship from blasting off\nwith the hydrogen bombs already loaded. Orkap and his companion were\ntaken into custody.\n\nThe rest, of course, is history. The gurus of Ophiuchus IX were shown\nwhat had been taking place in the name of friendship between themselves\nand Deneb and in the name of isolation. Most of the gurus retired\nentirely from active life. The few who did not spent the rest of their\ndays working for cooperation between Ophiuchus and the rest of the\nGalactic League. Orkap and his companion were sent back to Deneb for\npunishment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwo weeks later, Kovandaswamy shook Sria's hand.\n\n\"A girl,\" he said. \"You did it as a girl. I still can't believe it. But\nthen, of such stuff is the Mayhem legend made.\"\n\nMayhem smiled. Already the Hub had a new assignment for him. He could\nfeel the old excitement, the wonder, stirring him. He smiled again and\ntold Kovandaswamy: \"Better not tell that fellow Pandit. I think he had a\ncrush on Sria.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Think Yourself to Death, by C.H.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
