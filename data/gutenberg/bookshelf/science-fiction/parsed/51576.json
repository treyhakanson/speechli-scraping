She made herself\nlook at the hateful broad-shouldered image with the deliberately\npenetrating black eyes. She made herself watch his boy-image bend over\nKippie's slender girl-image, made herself listen to his mellow voice\ngasp, \"Kippie, sweetie-bug.\"\n\nSavagely she thrust upward on the ebony lever. Bass McDowall, Wall\nidol, and Kippie lurched and disappeared. Lights glowed from fixtures\nrecessed into the ceiling, illuminating the long, windowless Wall room.\n\nKathryn, whose hair was a snug, dark Kippie-cap, leaped from the Wall\nseat. \"Don't turn it off now! Couldn't you even tell, Mother? He's\ngoing to kiss her! Turn it back on this minute!\"\n\nAmanda stationed herself before the lever, shaking her head. \"Not until\nI've spoken to you,\" she said. \"Kathryn, I don't think you realize\nyet what it means, but you're the youngest person, the very youngest,\nliving in this city.\"\n\n\"Quit calling me that! Everyone has to call me Kippie.\" She cocked her\ndark head, Kippie-like. The red mark caused by the constant prodding\nof her index finger against her cheek glared. \"Bass loves Kippie. He\ncalled her sweetie-bug.\"\n\n\"I refuse to call you Kippie.\" She folded her arms. \"I don't want to\ndiscuss your name again, Kathryn.\"\n\n\"It will be Kippie.\" She squirmed into a Kippie-like position. \"Soon as\nI'm twenty-one, I'll change it. You wait!\"\n\n\"Perhaps you will, Kathryn. But I'll never call you Kippie.\"\n\n\"Oh, quit being silly and turn it on. He might kiss her again.\" She\nfocused her blue eyes upon the Wall. \"Turn it on.\"\n\n\"Kathryn, I want to talk to you, and I intend to do so without Bass\nMcDowall staring over my shoulder.\" She sat down beside her daughter.\n\"Now, Kathryn, you're nineteen years old, and you're certainly\nattractive by any--\"\n\n\"I don't have dimples like Kippie does.\" Remembering, she poked her\nfinger back into her cheek.\n\n\"I'm not talking about Kippie.\" She stared at the finger sunk into her\ndaughter's cheek, wondering how many times she had explained that it\nwouldn't cause a dimple. \"I want you to get married, Kathryn.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I've told you a million times, I won't. You're always after me!\" she\nwailed. \"Bass won't ever marry anyone, not even Kippie, and she's got\ndimples. Bass says--\"\n\n\"Bass McDowall is not a real person. He's only an actor.\"\n\n\"He's the realest thing in the world. But he won't marry me, so you'd\nbetter forget it.\" She stepped to turn the Wall on again.\n\nInstantly the ash tray was in Amanda's hand, the massive glass tray\nDell had given her. She hurled it at the Wall, which shattered with a\nbrittle explosive splintering.\n\nKathryn jumped back, wailing. \"I hate you!\" Frantically she manipulated\nthe lever and twisted the ebony dials. \"Bass, come back. Bass!\"\n\nAmanda patted the Wall seat. \"Sit down, Kathryn.\"\n\nFinally the girl sat down, sullenly rubbing her eyes with her fists.\n\n\"Kathryn, have you noticed that we never see infants on the Wall? We\nnever see small children, either, because, Kathryn, you're the youngest\nperson in this city. The week after you were born, the city hospital's\nobstetrical ward closed permanently.\"\n\nKathryn sobbed convulsively. \"Who needs babies? I want Bass!\"\n\n\"The human race needs babies! Kathryn, you sit so complacently in front\nof your Wall and pretend there isn't a world! There won't be unless you\nwake up.\"\n\n\"Don't be silly!\"\n\n\"I'm not. Kathryn, you may be the youngest person in the world, for\nall I know. Forty or fifty years from now this planet will be cluttered\nwith blank Walls. There'll be no one to watch them.\"\n\n\"Well, there's nothing I can do about it. I'm not different, like you.\"\n\n\"Kathryn, marry. Have children. Persuade your friends at the office--\"\n\nShe laughed shrilly, rocking back against the Wall seat. \"Friends! They\nhate me, every one of them, and I hate them. Even if Bass did marry me,\nthey'd only take him away.\"\n\nAmanda clutched her fists. \"I don't want you to marry Bass. You must\nfind some nice boy your own age.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mother! You want me to marry some stupid, ugly boy! You can't make\nme!\"\n\n\"Kathryn, he needn't be dull. There are hundreds of boys, each\ninteresting in--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHearing a sound, she looked up to see Dell, thin and red-headed,\nstanding in the doorway staring at the shattered Wall.\n\nKathryn jumped up. \"Mother broke it. She threw that big green ash tray\nand broke it all to pieces.\"\n\nDell looked questioningly at Amanda. \"Honey, why'd you do that?\"\n\n\"She's jealous of Bass!\"\n\n\"Now isn't Bass pretty young for you, honey?\" He stooped to remove the\nash tray from inside the shattered Wall. \"Now, how can I watch Alice\nthis evening? She promised me a special dance in that red dress she was\nshowing me last night.\"\n\n\"Showing you?\" She sprang up. \"She showed it to every man in the\ncountry, Dell.\"\n\nHe frowned. \"Well, I'll call Replacements. They'll have a new Wall in\nbefore Alice comes.\"\n\n\"And I'll smash it too. I'll smash every replacement you can buy!\"\n\n\"Now, Amanda.\" He regarded her mildly. \"You're not jealous of Alice!\nHoney, if you'd watch Lester, you wouldn't care about Alice and me.\"\n\nShe took the intact ash tray from him. \"I'm not jealous of Alice, and I\nhaven't been for twenty years. But Dell, do you realize Kathryn was the\nlast child born in this city?\"\n\nThe girl's voice was harsh. \"She wants me to marry some stupid, ugly\nboy. And I won't do it! I love Bass.\"\n\nDell's pale eyes were rebuking. \"Amanda, how can you expect Kippie to\ndo that?\"\n\nShe stepped back. \"Kippie?\" she said harshly. \"Dell, that girl standing\nthere is Kathryn, our daughter--not Kippie.\"\n\n\"Don't let such little things upset you, baby. I'll go call\nReplacements, and we'll all sit down together when Alice and Lester\ncome.\" He turned.\n\nShe seized his arm. \"I will _not_ watch Lester,\" she said. \"I will not\nsit and stare at that big, gray-haired ape and pretend I'm in love with\nhim.\"\n\nDell frowned. \"You don't really think he looks like an ape, do you,\nbaby? I was--well, thinking of changing my name to Lester.\"\n\nKathryn leaped to hug him. \"Oh Daddy! It'll be so wonderful. Lester,\nLester, Lester! If we had an Alice and a Bass, we'd be almost like a\nreal family.\"\n\nShe stared at them. \"I'd hoped to put you in a favorable frame of mind\nfor this, Kathryn,\" she said. \"You'll remember that three years ago the\nWatsons, next door, had Wall failure and couldn't get service until\nmorning. I invited them to watch our Wall.\"\n\nDell nodded. \"Haven't seen them since, now that I think of it.\"\n\n\"You haven't. But tonight Mrs. Watson is lending me her son Gerald.\nHe's coming at seven.\"\n\n\"Mother!\" Kathryn cried, releasing Dell. \"How terrible! Gerald! What a\nstupid name. I love Bass, and you can't take him away from me.\"\n\n\"That wasn't very nice, was it, Amanda?\"\n\n\"It's done,\" she said. \"He's twenty-two, and I want you to talk to him,\nKathryn.\"\n\nKathryn scowled.\n\n\"And I've arranged for you to go over to their house to watch Alice, if\nyou must, Dell.\"\n\nDell forgot he was indignant. \"Well, Kippie, maybe this one time you\ncan do as your mother wants,\" he said. \"Surely Bass won't mind if you\nmiss him this once. He's an understanding sort of chap.\"\n\nKathryn thought for a moment, scowling. \"All right, I'll do it--if\nyou'll call me Kippie, Mother.\"\n\nAmanda studied her. \"All right--Kippie,\" she said finally.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter agreeing reluctantly not to call Replacements until Gerald had\ncome and gone, Kippie wriggled into a Kippie-like position and poked\nher finger deep into her cheek again.\n\nGerald, who arrived promptly at seven, wore his light hair combed\ninto a Bass-like curl low over his forehead. He speared Amanda with a\npenetrating stare, making her shiver as she led him to the Wall room.\n\nKippie sulked angrily on the Wall seat.\n\nAmanda introduced them, and they looked at each other, their glances\nrevealing no interest.\n\n\"You're trying to comb your hair like Bass,\" Kippie accused.\n\nGerald grinned. \"Sure thing, sweetie-bug.\"\n\n\"Then you should dye it. It's the wrong color. Bass doesn't have blond\nhair. And why is your name still Gerald? Don't you ever want to be\nBass?\"\n\nGerald looked slapped. \"I tried. Honest, I really did. But you know\nthere's a limit, and the man at the bureau said there were too many\nBasses already.\" His face brightened. \"But my parents call me Bass all\nthe time.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nGerald shuffled his feet. Gingerly he sat down.\n\n\"Uh, did you see them last night?\" he asked.\n\n\"Of course. I always see them, except when my mother does something\nstupid.\"\n\nQuickly Amanda excused herself and went to the Food Center. She leaned\nagainst the counter, trying to overhear their conversation.\n\nThey spoke in broken murmurs momentarily, then were silent.\n\nKippie cleared her throat irritably.\n\n\"Uh, nice weather,\" Gerald said loudly.\n\n\"I haven't been out.\"\n\nThey were silent again. She tried to make her fingers stop picking at a\nspot on the counter surface.\n\nSuddenly Kippie emerged hurriedly from the Wall room, looking put upon.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" Amanda demanded.\n\n\"He can't talk like Bass, even when he tries. And his hair is the wrong\ncolor, and he has blue eyes.\"\n\n\"But Kathryn--Kippie, those are external characteristics! You can't\njudge a person by the color of his hair and his eyes. You must get\nacquainted with him.\"\n\n\"I won't do it. I don't love him. I love Bass!\" She cocked her head,\nKippie-like. \"And besides, he loves the real Kippie. And I'll never\nhave dimples. I'm going to call Replacements.\"\n\nAmanda seized her arm. \"Call them, and I'll break the new Wall too.\nI'll break every Wall you bring into this house. Don't you understand\nwhat's happening?\"\n\n\"Quit being stupid.\"\n\n\"I'll break every Wall you have installed.\"\n\n\"And every time you do it, I'll order a new one.\" She broke loose and\nran to the communicator.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe had to do something. She wondered briefly, must I do something? It\ncould only be the survival instinct driving her. Perhaps, she thought\nwryly, she was the only person who still possessed that particular\ninstinct.\n\nShe could never break every Wall in the world, no matter how she tried.\n\nShe picked up the magazine Kippie had thrown down that morning. Running\nher finger over the cover, she poked it through Bass's penetrating eye.\nShe poked Kippie in the nose.\n\nShe flipped the magazine open and went through it, mutilating the\npages. \"There's a hole in your head, Lester....\n\n\"One less eye for you, Alice....\n\n\"Poor little Kippie, I tore your chin. Right through the dimple. Will\nBass love you now, Kippie?\n\n\"Goodby, Bass.\" She crumpled him into a ball and threw him at the sink.\n\nOn the next page was a print of a restaurant. She read the caption.\n\n\"For two hours each evening, while filmed sequences are shown to the\nhome audience, the stars retire to Antola's for sandwiches, drinks and\nshop talk.\"\n\nShe tried to stop her thoughts as they went to the sleeping alcove and\nthe old gun in the top shelf of the built-ins. Dell hadn't bothered to\nunload it since he'd cleaned it last.\n\nShe dropped the magazine and went to the top shelf of the built-ins.\nThe gun was there.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt didn't take her long to drive downtown. There were no other cars on\nthe streets, and the current to the traffic lights had been cut three\nyears before. She passed only a prowling squad car, and the two police\nstared at her curiously.\n\nShe parked a block from Antola's. Leaving the car, she slung her purse,\nheavy with the gun, over her arm. Briskly she walked down the deserted\nstreet.\n\nAntola, standing behind the bar, was tall, thin and red-headed. He\nstared at her incredulously, wiping his hands repeatedly on his long\nwhite apron.\n\nShe went past the bar to a small table.\n\nAntola continued to wipe his hands, as if they would not quite come\ndry. \"You want something?\"\n\n\"Yes, bring me a bacon and tomato sandwich and milk.\"\n\n\"Don't have bacon and tomato. Kippie, she likes tuna. Bass hamburg.\nLester and Alice, they both take grilled cheese. Which do you want?\"\n\n\"Bring me tuna and milk.\"\n\n\"Kippie, she says milk don't go with tuna. Makes a big blob inside.\"\n\n\"I said tuna and milk.\"\n\n\"Okay, if you want a blob inside. Kippie don't.\" He ambled away.\n\nNot knowing how long she might have to wait, she nibbled at her\nsandwich.\n\nSoon she heard voices approaching the restaurant. She snaked her hand\ntoward the purse, opened it and clutched the gun.\n\nAlice entered first, her hair a disciplined halo of red-gold, her eyes\nvivid green. She was quarreling with Bass, who cheerfully ignored her,\nhis penetrating eyes staring greedily at the bottles behind the bar.\n\nSmall, precocious-seeming Kippie followed, her dark hair ruffled by the\nwind. She stared lovingly up into Lester's eyes.\n\nWhen the door had closed behind them, Amanda stood and raised the gun.\nThey hadn't noticed her, they'd been too anxious to mount the bar\nstools. Ducks in a shooting gallery, she thought.\n\nAlice was sitting nearer her, combing her hair with her fingers.\nHolding the gun out before her with both hands, Amanda aimed it at\nAlice's hair. She pulled the trigger.\n\nAt the sound, they all tried to duck, except Alice, who folded quietly\nto the floor. Amanda aimed again, and this time Lester crumpled.\n\nDucks in a shooting gallery, she thought. See if you can make that big\ndrake, Bass, fall off his stool.\n\nBass fell. Kippie screamed, banishing her dimples, and fell beside him.\n\nAntola had disappeared. It didn't matter. She returned the gun to her\npurse. She hadn't decided what to do next. Suddenly feeling hungry, she\nsat down to finish her sandwich.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen she was through, she rose, slung her purse over her arm again and\nstepped past the four bodies. They hardly seemed real, lying in their\nseparate pools of crimson.\n\nThe two policemen came in, staring at her again.\n\n\"Catch her!\" Antola cried from beneath the bar. \"She done it! She\nkilled them all! Poor little Kippie!\"\n\nThe florid policeman locked his hand about her wrist, while the other\ncried for Antola to come out.\n\nHer wrists were quickly handcuffed, and the florid policeman escorted\nher to the police car. He shoved her into the back seat.\n\nShe didn't move, didn't think. The world seemed frozen.\n\nIt didn't begin to thaw again until the second squad car and the\nambulances arrived. They came slowly, without sirens or flashing\nlights. She wondered why they came so casually.\n\nThe florid policeman returned to the car. \"All dead,\" he said. \"Even\npoor little Kippie.\"\n\nSilently they drove the deserted streets. She looked out at the\nbuildings, knowing the people inside them soon would be shocked by\nthe news of the stars' deaths.\n\nWhen they reached police headquarters, she had to run to keep up with\nthe florid policeman as he pulled her up the stone steps. They walked\nendless corridors, gray and gloomy, until they emerged into a small,\ndim room.\n\nA man in a tweed coat, who smoked a pipe and spoke suavely, stepped\nfrom the group of men in street clothes.\n\n\"Did you kill them?\" he asked. \"Don't be afraid to tell me. I only want\nto know if you killed them.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Certainly I did it.\"\n\nHe took her purse from the uniformed policeman and removed the gun.\n\"But why, tell me. Were you jealous of Alice, perhaps?\" His pipe jumped\nas he smiled confidentially.\n\n\"Certainly not!\" she said. \"I did it to save the human race from\nsuicide.\"\n\nThe men smiled, amused.\n\n\"Lock her up until we decide,\" the man in tweed instructed the florid\npoliceman. He gave her the purse, minus the gun.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA bony, disapproving matron led her to a cell and locked her into it.\nAmanda requested pencil and paper.\n\nThe matron frowned but brought them. Placing the paper against her\npurse, she began composing a statement to the press, making clear her\nmotives.\n\nThe filmed sequence still played on the small Wall opposite her cell.\nShe glanced up occasionally at the faces and smiled.\n\nShe had almost completed the statement when the filmed sequence ended.\nThe small, oily emcee appeared upon the Wall. \"Ladies and gentlemen,\"\nhe said.\n\nShe waited expectantly for the death announcement.\n\n\"Our stars!\" He flung out his arms dramatically.\n\nAnd the four stars pranced, smiling, across the Wall. Kippie, Bass,\nAlice and Lester.\n\nAmanda jumped to the bars. It was not a film.\n\n\"Matron!\" she screamed. \"Matron!\" Frantically she stared at the four\nactors whom she had murdered and who were alive and smiling.\n\n\"Matron!\"\n\nThe bony matron unlocked the cell. \"Come with me.\"\n\n\"Matron, I killed them. I shot them!\"\n\n\"Come with me.\"\n\nThe matron led her into a small, dim room.\n\nThe tweedy man smiled confidentially around his pipe. \"Are you ready to\ngo home, Mrs. Davis?\"\n\n\"But I murdered them. You have to keep me here!\" She tried to catch\nthe lapels of his suit.\n\nHe smiled again. \"Who did you murder, Mrs. Davis?\"\n\n\"All of them. You know I did it. I shot them, and they were all dead.\nHe said so--the policeman.\" Her hands shook.\n\n\"Look over there.\" He pointed to a small Wall. \"They're alive and\nperforming, aren't they, Mrs. Davis?\"\n\nShe looked at the Wall. Alice and Lester were planting a small rose\nbush together.\n\n\"You see, occasionally women do suffer from delusions like yours,\" he\nsaid. \"But now that you've recovered, I'll drive you home. After a\nquiet night you'll forget all this.\"\n\n\"They aren't delusions,\" she insisted. \"I did it, with my husband's\ngun. I waited until they closed the door, then I aimed--I know I did\nit.\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly,\" he said, leading her to the door. \"Now come along\nhome, Mrs. Davis.\"\n\nShe continued to protest, but he pulled her through the corridors and\ndown the steps to a waiting car. He nudged her into the front seat.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey passed darkened buildings. She saw the neon sign atop the _Herald_\noffices ahead. If no one knew she'd killed them, no one would awaken.\nNo one would live again. The world would end after all.\n\nShe opened the door and jumped from the moving car. Stumbling, she ran\ntoward the _Herald_ offices.\n\nShe stumbled into the building and began seeking through its bright\ncorridors. Stopping to stare at each office door, she finally found the\none labeled \"Editorial. Mr. Gray.\" She pushed into the office.\n\nThe little man behind the desk wore horn-rim glasses and smoked a pipe\nthat was a copy of Lester's. He smiled paternally. \"Yes, dear?\"\n\n\"I killed them! They're all dead!\"\n\nRealizing excitement did nothing to make her words more believable, she\nforced herself to be calm.\n\nEditor Gray wore his gray hair combed straight back, Lester-like. He\nstood, putting one hand into his trouser pocket, as Lester always did.\n\n\"Who did you kill?\" he asked quietly. \"Calm down, dear. Tell me who you\nkilled.\"\n\n\"Lester and all the rest. You have to print it. I shot them--they're\ndead. Print it in your paper.\"\n\nHe crossed the room to his Wall. Bass and Kippie were rolling pie dough\ntogether, one on either end of the rolling pin.\n\n\"I'm afraid you're imagining these things, my dear.\" He sucked his\npipe, looking lovingly at Kippie. \"I could love that child, but of\ncourse Alice would be jealous.\"\n\nShe backed away from him into the arms of the tweedy man, who had come\ninto the office.\n\n\"I'm sorry to bother you, sir,\" he said. \"This poor woman is suffering\nfrom delusions. I was driving her home when she escaped me.\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" Editor Gray said mildly. \"Perhaps she needs\nprofessional help. Have you considered that, my dear?\"\n\nBut Amanda was staring at Bass. She stared at his penetrating eyes, his\nbroad shoulders, at the curl of hair combed low over his forehead. The\ncurl was swirled left, not right.\n\nThe tweedy man took her arm, guided her from the building and nudged\nher into the car.\n\nDo they curl a dead actor's hair differently, she wondered. She had\nkilled them. Why weren't they dead?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen they reached her house, it was completely dark. Either Dell and\nKippie had gone to bed or the Wall had been replaced and was playing.\n\n\"I'm sorry I had to bring you away so abruptly,\" the tweedy man said.\n\"We can't afford to have the press print unfavorable reports about the\nforce, you understand.\" He fingered his pipe. \"Now, Mrs. Davis, get a\ngood night's sleep. Tomorrow you'll realize it was all a bad dream. You\nwouldn't kill the stars.\"\n\nWoodenly she walked up the front walk. Hearing Bass's mellow voice from\nthe Wall room, she knew Kippie and Dell were up.\n\nShe entered the room. Kippie sat curled on the Wall seat.\n\nAmanda stared at the handsome face on the Wall. Bass McDowall, Wall\nidol. Why wasn't he dead?\n\nHis curl was still curled wrong. She looked more closely at his face as\nhe leaned toward Kippie, gasping, \"Sweetie-bug.\"\n\nThere was a small scar beneath his left eye. The tiniest, most\ninsignificant scar, but it had never been there before.\n\n\"Poor Bass, he looks so tired,\" the Kippie on the Wall seat said. \"See\nhow his face looks thinner when he's tired? I wonder if she notices it.\"\n\nDell said, \"After all, Bass has worked hard today, Kippie.\"\n\nBass's face was indeed thinner. Thinner face, small scar that hadn't\nbeen there before, curl that curled wrong--what did it mean?\n\nSuddenly she realized the image on the Wall wasn't Bass. She corrected\nherself. He was a different Bass. He wasn't the one she had shot, but\nhis almost identical double.\n\nShe stared at her daughter, who looked more like Kippie each time she\nassumed another of her characteristics or poses. There were hundreds\nof young people wanting to be Bass or Kippie, hundreds of young men\ncombing their hair the way Bass did, smiling as he did, learning to use\ntheir eyes as he did. And if the time should come when a new Bass was\nneeded, there he was, hundreds of him.\n\nShe frowned. Undoubtedly they had several doubles waiting conveniently\nnearby to perform if something should happen to one of the stars.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe felt a choking in her throat. It would be as impossible to kill all\nthe Basses and Kippies as it would be to break every Wall in the world.\nThere was no way to get rid of them, no way to make people listen to\nwhat was happening. No way to prevent humanity from watching itself to\nextinction.\n\nAs they grew older, she guessed, the actors would grow older too.\nGradually Bass would be thirty, then thirty-five, and Lester and the\nothers would age too. But no one would notice; everyone would be aging\nat the same rate.\n\nBut some day someone would notice. Some day all the Lesters would\ndie, and there would be no more Lester to smile at Alice and look\nthoughtful. And people would look around and see that her daughter,\nKathryn, was the youngest person in the world.\n\nBut by then even Kathryn would be past the child-bearing age.\n\nStunned, she sat down beside Dell. He squeezed her hand. She looked up\nat the Wall, into Bass's penetrating dark eyes. His eyes were so deep,\nshe thought. His hands were strong, and his face was intelligent. How\ncould she ever have hated him?\n\n\"Where've you been, baby?\" Dell asked.\n\nShe shook her head irritably. \"Be quiet,\" she said. \"Can't you see he's\ngoing to kiss her?\"\n\nPerhaps she should change her name to Alice. Then they'd have Kippie,\nAlice and Lester. All they needed was a Bass, and they would be almost\nlike a real family.\n\nIt would be so easy to forget this way, looking deep into Bass's dark\neyes.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Shatter the Wall, by Sydney Van Scyoc\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SHATTER THE WALL ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51576.txt or 51576.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/5/7/51576/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
