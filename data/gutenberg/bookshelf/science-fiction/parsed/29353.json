Not infrequently I gain much amusement\nobserving these cocky youngsters who strut in the blue-and-silver\nuniforms of the Service in which, until more or less recently, I bore\nthe rank of Commander.\n\nThere is young Clippen, for instance, a nice, clean youngster; third\nofficer, I believe, on the _Caliobre_, one of the newest ships of the\nSpecial Patrol Service. He drops in to see me as often as he has leave\nhere at Base, to give me the latest news, and to coax a yarn, if he can,\nof the old days. He is courteous, respectful ... and yet just a shade\ncondescending. The condescension of youth.\n\n\"Something new under the sun after all, sir,\" he commented the other\nday. That, incidentally, is a saying of Earth, whence the larger part of\nthe Service's officer personnel has always been drawn. Something new\nunder the sun! The saying probably dates back to an age long before man\nmastered space.\n\n\"Yes?\" I leaned back more comfortably, happy, as always, to hear my\nnative Earth tongue, and to speak it. The Universal language has its\nobvious advantages, but the speech of one's fathers wings thought\nstraightest to the mind. \"What now?\"\n\n\"Creatures of space!\" announced Clippen importantly, in the fashion of\none who brings surprising news. \"'Electites,' they call them. Beings who\nlive in space--things, anyway; I don't know that you could call them\nbeings.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Hm-m.\" I looked past him, down a mighty corridor of dimming years.\nCreatures that lived in space.... I smiled in my beard. \"Creatures\nperhaps twice the height of a man in their greatest dimension? In shape\nlike a crescent, with blunted horns somewhat straightened near the tips,\nand drawn close together?\" I spoke slowly, drawing from my store of\nmemories. \"A pale red in color, intangible and yet--\"\n\n\"You've heard, sir!\" said Clippen disappointedly to me. \"My news is\nstale.\"\n\n\"Yes, I've heard,\" I nodded. \"'Electites,' they call them, eh? That's\nthe work of our great scientific minds, I presume?\"\n\n\"Er--yes. Undoubtedly.\" Clippen started to wander restlessly around the\nroom. He had a great respect for the laboratory men, with their white\ncoats and their wise, solemn airs, and he disliked exceedingly to have\nme present my views regarding these much overrated gentlemen. I have\nalways been a man of action, and pottering over coils and glass vials\nand pages of figures has always struck me as something not to be\nincluded in a man's proper sphere of activity. \"Well, I believe I'll be\nshoving off, sir; just dropped in for a moment,\" Clippen continued.\n\"Thought perhaps you hadn't heard of the news; it seems to be causing a\ngreat deal of discussion among the officers at Base.\"\n\n\"Something new under the sun, eh?\" I chuckled.\n\n\"Why, yes. You'll agree to that, sir, surely?\" I believe the lad was\nslightly nettled by my chuckle. No one likes to bear stale news.\n\n\"I'll agree to that,\" I said, smiling broadly now. \"'Tis easier than\ndebating the matter, and an old man can't hope to hold his own in\nargument with you quick-witted youngsters.\"\n\n\"I've never noticed,\" replied young Clippen rather acidly, \"that you\nwere particularly averse to argument, sir. Rather the reverse. But I\nmust be moving on; we're shoving off soon, I hear, and you know the\nroutine here at Base.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe saluted me, rather carelessly, I should say, and I returned the\nsalute with the crispness with which the gesture was rendered in my day.\nWhen he was gone, I turned to my desk and began searching in that huge\nand capacious drawer in which were kept, helter-skelter, the dusty,\nfaded, nondescript mementoes of a thousand adventures.\n\nI found, at last, what I was seeking. No impressive thing, this: a bit\nof metal, irregular in shape, no larger than my palm, and three times\nthe thickness. One side was smooth; the other was stained as by great\nheat, and deeply pitted as though it had been steeped in acid.\n\nSilently, I turned the bit of metal over and over in my hands. I had\nbegged hard for this souvenir; had obtained it only by passing my word\nits secret would never reach the Universe through me. But now ... now\nthat seal of secrecy has been removed.\n\nAs I write this, slowly and thoughtfully, as an old man writes,\nrelishing his words for the sake of the memories they bring before his\neyes, a bit of metal holds against the vagrant breeze the filled pages\nof my script. A bit of metal, no larger than my palm, and perhaps three\ntimes the thickness. It is irregular in shape, and smooth on one side.\nThe other side is eroded as though by acid.\n\nNot an imposing thing, this ancient bit of metal, but to me one of my\nmost precious possessions. It is, beyond doubt, the only fragment of my\nold ship, the _Ertak_, now in existence and identifiable.\n\nAnd this story is the story of that pitted metal and the ship from which\nit came; one of the strangest stories in all my storehouse of memories\nof days when only the highways of the Universe had been charted, and\nbreathless adventure awaited him who dared the unknown trails of the\nSpecial Patrol Service.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe _Ertak_, as I recall the details now, had just touched at Base upon\nthe completion of a routine patrol--one of those monotonous, fruitless\naffairs which used to prey so upon Correy's peace of mind. Correy was my\nfirst officer on the _Ertak_, and the keenest seeker after trouble I\nhave ever known.\n\n\"The Chief presents his compliments and requests an immediate audience\nwith Commander Hanson,\" announced one of the brisk, little attaches of\nBase, before I'd had time to draw a second breath of fresh air.\n\nI glanced at Correy, who was beside me, and winked. That is, I quickly\ndrew down the lid of one eye--a peculiar little gesture common to Earth,\nwhich may mean any one of many things.\n\n\"Sounds like something's in the wind,\" I commented in a swift aside.\n\"Better give 'no leaves' until I come back.\"\n\n\"Right, sir!\" chuckled Correy. \"It's about time.\"\n\nI made my way swiftly to the Chief's private office, and was promptly\nadmitted. He returned my salute crisply, and wasted no time in getting\nto the point.\n\n\"How's your ship, Commander? Good condition?\"\n\n\"Prime, sir.\"\n\n\"Supplies?\"\n\n\"What's needed could be taken on in two hours.\" In the Service, Earth\ntime was an almost universal standard except in official documents.\n\n\"Good!\" The Chief picked up a sheaf of papers, mostly standard charts\nand position reports, I judged, and frowned at them thoughtfully. \"I've\nsome work cut out for you, Commander.\n\n\"Two passenger ships have recently been reported lost in space. That\nwouldn't be so alarming if both had not, when last reported, been in\nabout the same position. Perhaps it is no more than a coincidence, but,\nwith space travel still viewed with a certain doubt by so many, the\nCouncil feels something should be done to determine the cause of these\ntwo losses.\n\n\"Accordingly, all ships have been rerouted to avoid the area in which\nit is presumed these losses took place. The locations of the two ships,\ntogether with their routes and last reported positions, are given here.\nThere will be no formal orders; you are to cruise until you have\ndetermined, and if possible, eliminated the danger, or until you are\ncertain that no further danger exists.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe slid the papers across his desk, and I picked them up.\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" I said. \"That will be all?\"\n\n\"You understand your orders?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\"\n\n\"Very well. Good luck, Commander!\"\n\nI saluted and hurried out of the room, back to my impatient first\nofficer.\n\n\"What's up, sir?\" he asked eagerly.\n\n\"Can't say that I know, to be truthful about it. Perhaps nothing;\nperhaps a great deal. Give orders to take on all necessary supplies--in\ndouble-quick time. I've promised the Chief we'll be ready to shove off\nin two hours. I'll meet you in the navigating room, and give you all the\ninformation I have.\"\n\nCorrey saluted and rushed away to give the necessary orders.\nThoughtfully, I made my way through the narrow, ethon-lighted\npassageways to the navigating room, where Correy very shortly joined me.\n\nBriefly, I repeated the Chief's conversation, and we both bent over the\ncharts and position reports.\n\n\"Hm-m!\" Correy was lost in thought for a moment as he fixed the location\nin his mind. \"Rather on the fringe of things. Almost anything could\nhappen out there, sir. That would be on the old Belgrade route, would it\nnot?\"\n\n\"Yes. It's still used, however, as you know, by some of the smaller,\nslower ships making many stops. Or was, until the recent order. Any\nguesses as to what we'll find?\"\n\n\"None, sir, except the obvious one.\"\n\n\"Meteorites?\"\n\nCorrey nodded.\n\n\"There's some bad swarms, now and then,\" he said seriously. I knew he\nwas thinking of one disastrous experience the _Ertak_ had had ... and of\nscores of narrow escapes. \"That would be the one likely explanation.\"\n\n\"True. But those ships were old and slow, they could turn about and\ndodge more easily than a ship of the _Ertak's_ speed. At full space\nspeed we're practically helpless; can neither stop nor change our course\nin time to avoid an emergency.\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" shrugged Correy, \"our job's to find the facts. I took the\nliberty of telling the men we were to be ready in an hour and a half. If\nwe are, do we shove off immediately?\"\n\n\"Just as soon as everything's checked. I leave it to you to give the\nnecessary orders. I know I can depend upon you to waste no time.\"\n\n\"Right, sir,\" said Correy, grinning like a schoolboy. \"We'll waste no\ntime.\"\n\nIn just a shade less than two hours after we had set down at Base, we\nwere rising swiftly at maximum atmospheric speed, on our way to a\nlittle-traveled portion of the universe, where two ships, in rapid\nsuccession, had met an unknown fate.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I wonder, sir, if you could come to the navigating room at once?\" It\nwas Kincaide's voice, coming from the instrument in my stateroom.\n\n\"Immediately, Mr. Kincaide.\" I asked no questions, for I knew my second\nofficer's cool-headed disposition. If something required my attention\nin the navigating room, in his opinion, it was something important. I\nthrew on my uniform hurriedly and hastened to Kincaide's side, wondering\nif at last our days of unrewarded searching were to bear fruit.\n\n\"Perhaps I called you needlessly, sir,\" Kincaide greeted me\napologetically, \"but, considering the nature of our mission, I thought\nit best to have your opinion.\" He motioned toward the two great\nnavigating charts, operated by super-radio reflexes, set in the surface\nof the table before him.\n\nIn the center of each was the familiar red spark which represented the\n_Ertak_ herself, and all around were the glowing points of greenish\nlight which gave us, in terrestial terms, the locations of the various\nbodies to the right and left, above and below.\n\n\"See here, sir--and here?\" Kincaide's blunt, capable forefingers\nindicated spots on each of the charts. \"Ever see anything like that\nbefore?\"\n\nI shook my head slowly. I had seen instantly the phenomena he had\npointed out. Using again the most understandable terminology, to our\nright, and somewhat above us, nearer by far than any of the charted\nbodies, was something which registered on our charts, as a dim and\nformless haze of pinkish light.\n\n\"Now the television, sir,\" said Kincaide gravely.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI bent over the huge, hooded disk, so unlike the brilliantly illuminated\ninstruments of to-day, and studied the scene reflected there.\n\nCentered in the field was a group of thousands of strange things, moving\nswiftly toward the ship. In shape they were not unlike crescents, with\nthe horns blunted, and pushed inward, towards each other. They glowed\nwith a reddish radiance which seemed to have its center in the thickest\nportion of the crescents--and, despite their appearance, they gave me,\nsomehow, an uncanny impression that they were in some strange way,\n_alive_! While they remained in a more or less compact group, their\nrelative positions changed from time to time, not aimlessly as would\ninsensate bodies drifting thus through the black void of space, but with\na sort of intelligent direction.\n\n\"What do you make of them, sir?\" asked Kincaide, his eyes on my face.\n\"Can you place them?\"\n\n\"No,\" I admitted, still staring with a fixed fascination at the strange\nscene in the television disk. \"Perhaps this is what we've been searching\nfor. Please call Mr. Correy and Mr. Hendricks, and ask them to report\nhere immediately.\"\n\nKincaide hastened to obey the order, while I watched the strange things\nin the field of the television disk, trying to ascertain their nature.\nThey were not solid bodies, for even as I viewed them, one was\nsuperimposed upon another, and I could see the second quite distinctly\nthrough the substance of the first. Nor were they rigid, for now and\nagain one of the crescent arms would move searchingly, almost like a\nthick, clumsy tentacle. There was something restless, _hungry_, in the\nmovement of the sharp arms of the things, that sent a chill trickling\ndown my spine.\n\nCorrey and Hendricks arrived together; their curiosity evident.\n\n\"I believe, gentlemen,\" I said, \"that we're about to find out the reason\nwhy two ships already have disappeared in this vicinity. Look first at\nthe charts, and then here.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey bent, for a moment, over the charts, and then stared down into the\ntelevision disk. Correy was first to speak.\n\n\"What are they?\" he gasped. \"Are they ... alive?\"\n\n\"That is what we don't know. I believe they are, after a fashion. And,\nif you'll observe, they are headed directly towards us at a speed which\nmust be at least as great as our own. Is that correct, Mr. Kincaide?\"\n\nKincaide nodded, and began some hasty figuring, taking his readings from\nthe finely ruled lines which divided the charts into little measured\nsquares, and checking speeds with the chronometers set into the wall of\nthe room.\n\n\"But I don't understand the way in which they register on our navigating\ncharts, sir,\" said Hendricks slowly. Hendricks, my youthful third\nofficer, had an inquiring, almost scientific mind. I have often said he\nwas the closest approach to a scientist I have ever seen in the person\nof an action-loving man. \"They're a blur of light on the charts--all out\nof proportion to their actual size. They must be something more than\nmaterial bodies, or less.\"\n\n\"They're coming towards us,\" commented Correy grimly, still bent over\nthe disk, \"as though they knew what they were doing, and meant\nbusiness.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" nodded Kincaide, picking up the paper upon which he had been\nfiguring. \"This is just a rule-of-thumb estimate, but if they continue\non their present course at their present speed, and we do likewise,\nthey'll be upon us in about an hour and a quarter--less, if anything.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"But I can't understand their appearance in the charts,\" muttered\nHendricks doggedly, still turning that matter over in his mind. \"Unless\n... unless ... ah! I'll venture I have it, sir! The charts are operated\nby super-radio reflexes; in others words, electrically. They would\nnaturally be extremely sensitive to an electrical disturbance. Those\nthings are electrical in nature. Highly so. That's the reason for the\nflare of light on the charts.\"\n\n\"Sounds logical,\" said Correy immediately. \"The point, as I see it, is\nnot what they are, but what we're to do about them. Do you believe, sir,\nthat they are dangerous?\"\n\n\"Let me ask you some questions to answer that one,\" I suggested. \"Two\nships are reported lost in space--in this immediate vicinity. We come\nhere to determine the cause of those losses. We find ourselves the\nevident objective of a horde of strange things which we cannot identify;\nwhich Mr. Hendricks, here, seems to have good reason to believe are\nsomehow electrical in nature. Putting all these facts together, what is\nthe most logical conclusion?\"\n\n\"That these things caused the two lost ships to be reported missing in\nspace!\" said Hendricks.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI glanced at Kincaide, and he nodded gravely.\n\n\"And you, Mr. Correy?\" I asked.\n\nCorrey shrugged.\n\n\"I believe you're, right, sir. They seem like such rather flimsy,\nharmless things, though, that the disintegrator rays will take care of\nwithout difficulty. Shall I order the ray operators to their stations,\nsir?\"\n\n\"Do that, please. And take personal charge of the forward projectors,\nwill you? Mr. Hendricks, will you command the after projectors? Mr.\nKincaide and I will carry on here.\"\n\n\"Shall we open upon them at will, or upon orders, sir?\" asked Correy.\n\n\"Upon orders,\" I said. \"And you'll get your orders as soon as they're in\nrange; I have a feeling we're in for trouble.\"\n\n\"I hope so, sir!\" grinned Correy from the door.\n\nHendricks followed him silently, but I saw there was a deep, thoughtful\nfrown between his brows.\n\n\"I think,\" commented Kincaide quietly, \"that Hendricks is likely to be\nmore useful to us in this matter than Correy.\"\n\nI nodded, and bent over the television disk. The things were perceptibly\nnearer; the hurtling group nearly filled the disk, now.\n\nThere was something horribly eager, horribly malignant, in the way they\nshone, so palely red, and in the fashion in which their blunt tentacles\nreached out toward the _Ertak_.\n\nI glanced up at the Earth clock on the wall.\n\n\"The next hour,\" I said soberly, \"cannot pass too quickly for me!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe had decelerated steadily during the hour, but we were still above\nmaximum atmospheric speed when at last I gave the order to open the\ninvaders with disintegrator rays. They were close, but of course the\nrays are not as effective in space as when operating in a more favorable\nmedium, and I wished to make sure of our prey.\n\nI pressed the attention signal to Correy's post, and he answered\ninstantly.\n\n\"Ready, Mr. Correy?\"\n\n\"Ready, sir!\"\n\n\"Then commence action!\"\n\nBefore I could repeat the command to Hendricks, I heard the deepening\nnote of the atomic generators, and knew Correy had already begun\noperations.\n\nTogether, and silently, Kincaide and I bent over the television disk. We\nwatched for a moment, and then, with one accord, lifted our heads and\nlooked into each other's eyes.\n\n\"No go, sir,\" said Kincaide quietly.\n\nI nodded. It was evident the disintegrator rays were useless here. When\nthey struck into the horde of crescent-shaped things coming so hungrily\ntoward us, the things changed from red to a sickly, yellowish pink, and\nseemed to writhe, as though in some discomfort, but that was all.\n\n\"Perhaps at closer range...?\" ventured Kincaide.\n\n\"I think not. If Mr. Hendricks is correct--and I believe he is--these\nthings aren't material; they're not matter, as we comprehend the word.\nAnd so, they can't be disintegrated.\"\n\n\"Then, sir, how are we to best them?\"\n\n\"First, we'll have to know more about them. For one thing, their mode of\nattack. We should know very soon. Please recall Mr. Hendricks, and then\norder all hands to their posts. We may be in for it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHendricks came rushing in breathlessly.\n\n\"The rays are useless, sir,\" he said. \"They'll be on us in a few\nminutes. Any further orders?\"\n\n\"Not yet. Have you any ideas as to their mode of attack? What they can\ndo to us?\"\n\n\"No, sir. That is, no reasonable idea.\"\n\n\"What's your unreasonable theory, then, Mr. Hendricks?\"\n\n\"I'd prefer, sir, to make further observation first,\" he replied.\n\"They're close enough now, I think, to watch through the ports. Have I\nyour permission to unshutter one of the ports?\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir.\" The _Ertak_, like all Special Patrol ships of the\nperiod, had but few ports, and these were kept heavily shuttered. Her\nhull was double; she was really two ships, one inside the other, the two\nskins being separated and braced by innumerable trusses. Between the\nouter and the inner skin the air pressure was kept about one half of\nnormal, thus distributing the strain of the pressure equally between the\ntwo hulls.\n\nIn order to arrange for a port or an exit, it was necessary to bring\nthese two skins close together at the desired point, and strengthen this\nweak point with many braces. As a further protection against an\nemergency--and a fighting ship must be prepared against all\nemergencies--the ports were all shuttered with massive doors of solid\nmetal, hermetically fitted. I am explaining this so much in detail for\nthe benefit of those not familiar with the ships of my day, and because\nthis information is necessary that one may have a complete understanding\nof subsequent events.\n\nHendricks, upon receiving my permission, sprang to one of the two ports\nin the navigating room and unshuttered it.\n\n\"The lights, please?\" he asked, over his shoulder. Kincaide nodded, and\nswitched off the _ethon_ tubes which illuminated the room. The three of\nus crowded around the recessed port.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe things were not only close: they were veritably upon us! Even as we\nlooked, one of them swept by the port so close that, save for the thick\ncrystal, one might have reached out into space and touched it.\n\nThe television disk had represented them very accurately. They were, in\ntheir greatest dimension, perhaps twice the height of a man, and at\nclose range their reddish color was more brilliant than I had imagined;\nin the thickest portion of the crescent, which seemed to be the nucleus,\nthe radiance of the thing was almost blinding.\n\nIt was obvious that they were not material bodies. There were no\ndefinite boundaries to their bodies; they faded off into nothingness in\na sort of fringe, almost like a dim halo.\n\nAn attention signal sounded sharply, and Kincaide groped his way swiftly\nto answer it.\n\n\"It's Correy, sir,\" he said. \"He reports his rays are utterly useless,\nand asks for further orders.\"\n\n\"Tell him to cease action, and report here immediately.\" I turned to\nHendricks, staring out the port beside me. \"Well, what do you make of\nthem now?\"\n\nBefore he could reply, Kincaide called out sharply.\n\n\"Come here, sir! The charts are out of commission. We've gone blind.\"\n\nIt was true. The charts were no more than twin rectangles of lambent red\nflame, with a yellow spark glowing dimly in the center of each, the fine\nblack lines ruled in the surface showing clearly against the wavering\nred fire.\n\n\"Mr. Hendricks!\" I snapped. \"Let's have your theory--reasonable or\notherwise.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHendricks, his face pressed at an angle against one side of the port,\nturned toward me, and swung the shutter into place. Kincaide snapped on\nthe lights.\n\n\"It's no longer a theory, sir,\" he said in a choked, hushed voice,\n\"although it's still unreasonable. These things--are _eating_ us!\"\n\n\"Eating us?\" Correy's voice joined Kincaide's and mine in the\nexclamation of amazement. He had just entered the navigating room in\nresponse to my order.\n\n\"Eroding us, absorbing us--whatever you want to call it. There's one at\nwork close enough to the port so that I could see it. It is feeding upon\nour hull as an electric arc feeds upon its electrodes!\"\n\n\"Farewell _Ertak_!\" said Correy grimly. \"Anything the rays can't\nlick--wins!\"\n\n\"Not yet!\" I contradicted him. \"Kincaide, what's the nearest body upon\nwhich we can set down?\"\n\n\"N-127, sir,\" he replied promptly. \"Just logged her a few minutes ago.\"\nHe poured hastily through a dog-eared index. \"Here it is: 'N-127,\natmosphere unbreathable; largely nitrogen, oxygen insufficient to\nsupport human life; no animal life reported; insects, large but reported\nnon-poisonous; vegetation heroic in size, probably with edible fruits,\nalthough reports are incomplete on this score; water unfit for drinking\npurpose unless distilled; land area approximately--'\"\n\n\"That's enough,\" I interrupted. \"Mr. Correy, set a course for N-127 by\nthe readings of the television instrument. Mr. Kincaide, accelerate to\nmaximum space speed, and set us down on dry land as quickly as emergency\nspeed can put us there. And you, Mr. Hendricks, please tell us all you\nknow--or guess--about the enemy.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHendricks waited, moodily silent, until the ship was coming around on\nher course, picking up speed every instant. Kincaide had gradually\nincreased the pull of the gravity pads to about twice normal, so that we\nfound it barely possible to move about. The _Ertak_ was an old-timer,\nbut she could pick up speed when she had to that would have thrown us\nall headlong were it not for the artificial gravity anchorage of the\npads.\n\n\"It's all guess-work,\" began Hendricks slowly, \"so I hope you won't\nplace too much reliance in my theories, sir. I'll just give you my line\nof reasoning, and you can evaluate it for yourself.\n\n\"These things are creatures of space. No form of life, as we know it,\ncan live in space. Therefore, they are not material; they are not\nmatter, like ourselves.\n\n\"From their effect upon the charts, we decided they were electrical in\nnature. Not made up of atoms and electrons, but of pure electrical\nenergy in an unfamiliar form.\n\n\"Then, remembering that they exist in space, and concluding that they\nwere the destroyers of the two ships we know of, I began wondering how\nthey brought about the destruction--or at least, the disappearance--of\nthese two ships. Life of any kind must have something to feed upon. To\nproduce one kind of energy we must convert, apparently consume, some\nother kind of energy. Even our atomic generators slowly but surely eat\nup the metal in which is locked the power which makes this ship's power\npossible.\n\n\"But, in space, what could these things feed upon? What--if not those\ntroublesome bodies, meteorites? And meteorites, as we know, are largely\nmetallic in composition. And ships are made of metal.\n\n\"Here are the only proofs, if proofs you can call them, that these are\nnot wild ideas: first, the disintegrator rays, working upon an\nelectrical principle, reacted upon but did not destroy these things, as\nmight be expected from the meeting of two not dissimilar manifestations\nof energy; and the fact that I did, from the port, see one of these\nspace-things, or part of one, flattened out upon the body of the\n_Ertak_, and feeding upon her skin, already roughened and pitted\nslightly from the thing's hungry activities.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHendricks fell silent, staring down at the floor. He was only a\nyoungster, and the significance of his remarks was as plain to him as it\nwas to the rest of us. If these monsters from the void were truly\nfeeding on the skin of our ship, vampire-like, it would not be long\nbefore it would be weakened; weakened to the danger point, weakened\nuntil we would explode in space like a gigantic bomb, to leave our\nfragments to whirl onward forever through the darkness and the silence\nof outer space.\n\n\"And what, sir, do you plan to do when we reach this N-127?\" asked\nCorrey. \"Burn them off with a run through the atmosphere?\"\n\n\"No; that wouldn't work, I imagine.\" I glanced at Hendricks inquiringly,\nand he shook his head. \"My only thought was to land, so that we would\nhave some chance. Outside the ship we can at least attack; locked in\nhere we're helpless.\"\n\n\"Attack, sir? With what?\" asked Kincaide curiously.\n\n\"That I can't answer. But at least we can fight--with solid ground under\nour feet. And that's something.\"\n\n\"You're right, sir!\" grinned Correy. It was the first smile that had\nappeared on the faces of any of us in many minutes. \"And fight we will!\nAnd if we lose the ship, at least we'll be alive, with a hope of\nrescue.\"\n\nHendricks glanced up at him and shook his head, smiling crookedly.\n\n\"You forget,\" he remarked, \"that there's no air to breathe on N-127. An\natmosphere of nitrogen. And no water that's drinkable--if the reports\nare accurate. A breathing mask will not last long, even the new types.\"\n\n\"That's so,\" said Kincaide. \"The tanks hold about a ten-hours' supply;\nless, if the wearer is working hard, or fighting.\"\n\nTen hours! No more, if we did not find some way to destroy these leeches\nof space before they destroyed the _Ertak_.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDuring the next half hour little was said. We were drawing close to our\ntiny, uninhabited haven, and both Correy and Kincaide were busy with\ntheir navigation. Working in reverse, as it were, from the rough\nreadings of the television disk settings, an ordinarily simple task was\nmade extremely difficult.\n\nI helped Correy interpret his headings, and kept a weather eye on the\ngauges over the operating table. We were slipping into the atmospheric\nfringe of N-127, and the surface-temperature gauge was slowly climbing.\nHendricks sat hunched heavily in a corner, his head bowed in his hands.\n\n\"I believe,\" said Kincaide at length, \"I can take over visually now.\" He\nunshuttered one of the ports, and peered out. N-127 was full abreast of\nus, and we were dropping sideways toward her at a gradually diminishing\nspeed. The impression given us, due to the gravity pads in the keel of\nthe ship, was that we were right side up, and N-127 was approaching us\nswiftly from the side.\n\n\"'Vegetation of heroic size' is right, too,\" said Correy, who had been\nexamining the terrain at close range, through the medium of the\ntelevision disk. \"Two of the leaves on some of the weeds would make an\nawning for the whole ship. See any likely place to land, Kincaide?\"\n\n\"Nowhere except along the shore--and then we'll have to do some nice\nwork and lay the _Ertak_ parallel to the edge of the water. The beach is\nnarrow, but apparently the only barren portion. Will that be all right,\nsir?\"\n\n\"Use your own judgment, but waste no time. Correy, break out the\nbreathing masks, and order the men at the air-lock exit port to stand\nby. I'm going out to have a look at these things.\"\n\n\"May I go with you, sir?\" asked Hendricks sharply.\n\n\"And I?\" pleaded Kincaide and Correy in chorus.\n\n\"You, Hendricks, but not you two. The ship needs officers, you know.\"\n\n\"Then why not me instead of you, sir?\" argued Correy. \"You don't know\nwhat you're going up against.\"\n\n\"All the more reason I shouldn't be receiving any information\nsecond-hand,\" I said. \"And as for Hendricks, he's the laboratory man of\nthe _Ertak_. And these things are his particular pets. Right,\nHendricks?\"\n\n\"Right, sir!\" said my third officer grimly.\n\nCorrey muttered under his breath, something which sounded very much like\nprofanity, but I let it pass.\n\nI knew just how he felt.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI have never liked to wear a breathing mask. I feel shut in, frustrated,\nmore or less helpless. The hiss of the air and the everlasting\n_flap-flap_ of the exhaust-valve disturb me. But they are very handy\nthings when you walk abroad on a world which has no breathable\natmosphere.\n\nYou've probably seen, in the museums, the breathing masks of that\nperiod. They were very new and modern then, although they certainly\nappear cumbersome by comparison with the devices of to-day.\n\nOur masks consisted of a huge shirt of air-tight, light material which\nwas belted in tightly around the waist, and bloused out like an ancient\nballoon when inflated. The arm-holes were sealed by two heavy bands of\nelastic, close to the shoulders, and the head-piece was of thin copper,\nset with a broad, curved band of crystal which extended from one side to\nthe other, across the front, giving the wearer a clear view of\neverything except that which was directly behind him. The balloon-like\nblouse, of course, was designed to hold a small reserve supply of air,\nfor an emergency, should anything happen to the tank upon the shoulders,\nor the valve which released the air from it.\n\nThey were cumbersome, uncomfortable things, but I donned mine and\nadjusted the menore, built into the helmet, to full strength. I wanted\nto be sure I kept in communication with both Hendricks and the sentries\nat the air-lock exit, and of course, inside the helmets, verbal\ncommunication was impossible.\n\nI glanced at Hendricks, and saw that he was ready and waiting. We were\nstanding inside the air-lock, and the mighty door of the port had just\nfinished turning in its threads, and was swinging back slowly on its\nmassive gimbals.\n\n\"Let's go, Hendricks,\" I emanated. \"Remember, take no chances, and keep\nyour eyes open.\"\n\n\"I'll remember, sir,\" replied Hendricks, and together we stepped out\nonto the coarse gravel of the beach.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBefore us, waves of an unhealthy, cloudy green rolled slowly, heavily\nshoreward, but we had no eyes for this, nor for the amazing vegetation\nof the place, plainly visible on the curving shores. We took a few\nhurried steps away from the ship, and then turned to survey the monsters\nwhich had attacked it.\n\nThey literally covered the ship; in several places their transparent,\nglowing bodies overlapped. And the sides of the _Ertak_, ordinarily\npolished and smooth as the surface of a mirror, were dull and deeply\neroded.\n\n\"Notice, sir,\" emanated Hendricks excitedly, \"how much brighter the\nthings are! They _are_ feeding, and they are growing stronger and more\nbrilliant. They--look out, sir! They're attacking! Our copper\nhelmets--\"\n\nBut I had seen it as quickly as he. Half a dozen of the glowing things,\nsensing in some way the presence of a metal which they apparently\npreferred to that of the _Ertak's_ hull, suddenly detached themselves\nand came swarming directly down upon us.\n\nI was standing closer to the ship than Hendricks, and they attacked me\nfirst. Several of them dropped upon me, their glowing bodies covering\nthe vision-piece, and blinding me with their light. I waved my arms and\nstarted to run blindly, incoherent warnings coming to me through the\nmenore from Hendricks and the sentries.\n\nThe things had no weight, but they emitted a strange, electric warmth\nwhich seemed to penetrate my entire body instantly as I ran unseeingly,\ntrying to find the ship, tearing at the fastenings of my mask as I ran.\nI could not, of course, enter the ship with these things clinging to my\ngarments.\n\nSuddenly I felt water splash under my feet; felt its grateful coolness\nupon my legs, and with a gasp I realized I had in my confusion been\nrunning away from the ship, instead of toward it. I stopped, trying to\nget a grip on myself.\n\nThe belt of the breathing mask came loose, and I tore the thing from me,\nholding my breath and staring around wildly. The ship was only a few\nyards away, and Hendricks, his mask already off, was running toward me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Back!\" I shouted. \"I'm all right now. Back!\" He hesitated for an\ninstant until I caught up with him, and then, together, we gained the\nsafety of the air-lock. Without orders, the men swung shut the ponderous\ndoor, and Hendricks and I stood there panting, and drawing in breaths\nof the _Ertak's_ clean, reviving air.\n\n\"That possibility was one we overlooked, sir,\" said Hendricks. \"Let's\nsee what's happening.\"\n\nWe opened the shutter of a port nearby and gazed out onto the beach we\nhad so hurriedly deserted. There were three or four of the glowing\nthings huddled shapelessly around our abandoned suits, and ragged holes\nshowed in several places in the thin copper helmets. Even as we looked,\nthey dissolved into nothingness, and after a few seconds of hesitation,\nthe things swarmed swiftly back to the ship.\n\n\"Well,\" I commented, trying to keep my voice reasonably free from the\nfeelings which gripped me, \"I believe we're beaten, Hendricks. At least,\nwe're helpless against them. Our only chance is that they'll leave us\nbefore they have eaten through the second skin; so long as we still have\nthat, we can live ... and perhaps be found.\"\n\n\"I doubt they'll leave us while there's a scrap of metal left, sir,\"\nsaid Hendricks slowly. \"Something's brought them from their usual\nhaunts. There's no reason why they should leave a certainty for an\nuncertainty. But we're not quite through trying. I saw something--have I\nyour permission to make another try at them? Alone, sir?\"\n\n\"Any chance of success, lad?\" I asked, searching his eyes.\n\n\"A chance, sir,\" he replied, his glance never wavering. \"I can be ready\nin a few minutes.\"\n\n\"Then, go ahead--on one condition: that you let me come with you.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir; as you wish. Have two other breathing masks ready. I'll\nbe back very soon.\"\n\nAnd he left me hastily, taking the steps of the companionway two at a\ntime.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was nearly an hour before Hendricks returned, bringing with him two\nof the most amazing pieces of apparatus I have ever seen.\n\nTo make each of them, he had taken a flask of compressed air from our\nemergency stores, and run a flexible tube from it into a cylindrical\ndrinking water container. Another tube, which I recognized as being a\npart of our fire-extinguishers, and terminating in a metal nozzle,\nsprouted from the water container. Both tubes were securely sealed into\nthe mouth of the metal cylinder, and lengths of hastily-knotted rope had\nbeen bound around each contrivance so that the two heavy containers, the\nair flask and the small water tank could be slung from the shoulders.\n\n\"Here, sir,\" he said hastily, \"get into a breathing mask, and put on\nthese things as you see me do. No time to explain anything now, except\nthis: as soon as you're outside the ship, turn the valve that opens the\ncompressed air flask. Hold this hose, coming from the water container,\nin your right hand. Don't touch the metal nozzle. Use the hose just as\nyou'd use a portable disintegrator-ray projector.\"\n\nI nodded, and followed his instructions as swiftly as possible. The two\ncontainers were heavy, but I adjusted their ropes across my shoulders so\nthat my left hand had easy access to the valve of the air flask, and the\nwater container was under my right arm where I could have the full use\nof the hose.\n\n\"Let me go first, sir,\" breathed Hendricks as we stood again in the\nair-lock, and the door turned out of its threaded seat and swung open.\n\"Keep your eyes on me, and do as I do!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe ran heavily out of the ship, his burdens lurching. I saw him turn the\npet-cock of the air flask, and I did likewise. A fine, powerful spray\nshot from the nozzle of the tube in my right hand, and I whirled around\nto face the ship.\n\nSeveral of the things were detaching themselves from the ship, and\ninstinctively, I turned the spray upon them. Hendricks, I could see out\nof the corner of my eye, did likewise. And now a most amazing thing\nhappened.\n\nThe spray seemed to dissolve the crescent-shaped creatures; where it\nhit, ragged holes appeared. A terrible hissing, crackling sound came to\nmy ears, even through the muffling mask I wore.\n\n\"It works! It works!\" Hendricks was crying over and over, hardly aware,\nin his excitement, that he was wearing a menore. \"We're saved!\"\n\nI put down three of the things in as many seconds. The central nucleus,\nin the thickest portion of the crescent, was always the last to go, and\nit seemed to explode in a little shower of crackling sparks. Hendricks\naccounted for four in the same length of time.\n\n\"Keep back, sir!\" he ordered in a sort of happy delirium. \"Let them come\nto us! We'll get them as they come. And they'll come, all right! Look at\nthem! Look at them! Quick, sir!\"\n\nThe things showed no fear, no intelligence. But one by one they sensed\nthe nearness of the copper helmets we wore, and detached themselves from\nthe ship. They moved like red tongues of flame upon the fat sides of the\n_Ertak_; crawling, uneasy flames, releasing themselves swiftly, one\nafter the other.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOur sprays met them in mid-air, and they dissolved like mist, one after\nthe other.... I directed my death-dealing spray with a grim delight, and\nas each glowing heart crackled and exploded, I chuckled to myself.\n\nThe sweat was running down my face; I was shaking with excitement One\nside of the ship was already cleared of the things; they were slipping\nover the top now, one or two at a time, and as rapidly as they came, we\nwiped them out.\n\nAt last there came a period in which there were none of the things in\nsight; none coming over the top of the sorely tried ship.\n\n\"Stay here and watch, Hendricks,\" I ordered. \"I'll look on the other\nside. I believe we've got them all!\"\n\nI hurried, as best I could, around to the other side of the _Ertak_. Her\nhull was pitted and corroded, but there was no other evidence of the\ncrescent-shaped things which had so nearly brought about the ship's\nuntimely, ghastly end.\n\n\"Hendricks!\" I emanated happily. \"'Nothing Less Than Complete Success!'\nAnd that's ours right now! They're gone--all of them!\"\n\nI slipped the contrivances from my shoulders and ran back to the other\nside of the ship. Hendricks was executing some weird sort of dance,\npatting the containers, swinging them wildly about his body, with an\nunderstandable fondness.\n\n\"Come inside, you idiot,\" I suggested, \"and tell us how you did it. And\nsee how it feels to be a hero!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It was just luck,\" Hendricks tried to make us believe, a few minutes\nlater, when Kincaide, Correy, and myself were through slapping his back\nand shaking his hands. \"When you, sir, splashed into the water, I had\njust torn off my mask. I saw some of the water fall on one of the things\nclustered upon your helmet, and I distinctly heard it hiss, as it fell.\nAnd where it fell, it made a ragged hole, which very slowly closed up,\nleaving a dim spot in the tentacle where the hole had been. As I figure\nit, the water--to put it crudely--short-circuited the electrical energy\nof the things. That, too, is just a guess, but I think it's a good one.\n\n\"Of course, it was a long chance, but it seemed like our only one. There\nwas nothing more or less than acidulated water in the containers; and\nthe air flasks, of course, were merely to supply the pressure to throw\nthe water out in a powerful spray. It happened to work, and there isn't\nanybody any happier about it than I am. I'm young, and there're lots of\nthings I want to do before I bleach my bones on a little deserted world\nlike this, that isn't important enough to even have a name!\"\n\nThat was typical of Hendricks. He was a practical scientist, willing and\neager to try out his own devices. A man of action first--as a man should\nbe.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNone of us, I think, spent a really easy moment until the _Ertak_ was\nback at Base. Our outer hull was weakened by at least half, and we were\nobliged to increase the degree of vacuum there and thus place the major\nportion of the load on the inner skin. It was a ticklish business, but\nthose old ships were solidly built, and we made it.\n\nAs soon as I had completed my report to the Chief, the _Ertak_ was sent\ninstantly to a secret field, under heavy guard, and a new outer hull put\nin place.\n\n\"This can't be made public,\" the Chief warned me. \"It would ruin the\nwhole future of space travel, as people are just learning to accept it\nas a matter of course. You will swear your men to utter secrecy, and\npass me your word, in behalf of your officers and yourself, that you\nwill not divulge any details of this trip.\"\n\nThe scientists, of course, questioned me for days; they turned up their\nnoses at the crude apparatus Hendricks had made, and which had saved the\n_Ertak_ and all her crew--but they kept it, I noticed, for future\nreference.\n\nAll ships were immediately supplied with devices very similar, but more\ncompact, the use of which only chief officers knew. And the scientists,\nto my knowledge, never did improve greatly on the model made for them by\nmy third officer.\n\nWhether or not these devices were ever used, I do not know. The\nsilver-sleeves at Base are a close-mouthed crew. Hendricks always held\nthat the group of things which so nearly caused the deaths of all of us\nhad wandered into our portion of Universe from some part of space beyond\nthe fringe of our knowledge.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut the same source which supplied one brood may supply another.\nEvidently, from young Clippen's report, this thing has happened. And\nsince starting this account, I have determined why the powers that be\nare willing now to have the knowledge made public. The new silicide\ncoating with which all space ships have been covered, is proof against\nall electrical action. That it is smoother and reduces friction, is, in\nmy opinion, no more than a rather halty explanation. It is, in reality,\nthe decidedly belated scientific answer to a question raised back in the\nhey-day of the _Ertak_, and my own youth.\n\nThat was many, many years ago, as the crabbed, uncertain writing on\nthese pages proves.\n\nAnd now, rather thankfully, I am about to place the last of these pages\nunder the curious weight which has held the others in place as I have\nwritten. That irregular bit of metal from the hull of the _Ertak_, so\ndeeply pitted on the one side, where the hungry things had sapped our\nprecious strength.\n\n\"Electites,\" the scientists have dubbed these strange crescent-shaped\nthings, young Clippen said. \"Electites!\" Something new under the sun!\n\nNew to this generation, perhaps, but not to old John Hanson.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Vampires of Space, by Sewell Peaslee Wright\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK VAMPIRES OF SPACE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 29353.txt or 29353.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/9/3/5/29353/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Meredith Bach, and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
