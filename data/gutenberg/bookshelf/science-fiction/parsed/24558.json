Schmitz\n\nIllustrated by Hortens\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nUncle William Boles' war-battered old Geest gun gave the impression that\nat some stage of its construction it had been pulled out of shape and\nthen hardened in that form. What remained of it was all of one piece.\nThe scarred and pitted twin barrels were stubby and thick, and the\nvacant oblong in the frame behind them might have contained standard\nenergy magazines. It was the stock which gave the alien weapon its\ncurious appearance. Almost eighteen inches long, it curved abruptly to\nthe right and was too thin, knobbed and indented to fit comfortably at\nany point in a human hand. Over half a century had passed since, with\nthe webbed, boneless fingers of its original owner closed about it, it\nlast spat deadly radiation at human foemen. Now it hung among Uncle\nWilliam's other collected oddities on the wall above the living room\nfireplace.\n\nAnd today, Phil Boles thought, squinting at the gun with reflectively\nnarrowed eyes, some eight years after Uncle William's death, the old war\nsouvenir would quietly become a key factor in the solution of a colonial\nplanet's problems. He ran a finger over the dull, roughened frame, bent\ncloser to study the neatly lettered inscription: GUNDERLAND BATTLE\nTROPHY, ANNO 2172, SGT. WILLIAM G. BOLES. Then, catching a familiar\nseries of clicking noises from the hall, he straightened quickly and\nturned away. When Aunt Beulah's go-chair came rolling back into the\nroom, Phil was sitting at the low tea table, his back to the fireplace.\n\nThe go-chair's wide flexible treads carried it smoothly down the three\nsteps to the sunken section of the living room, Beulah sitting jauntily\nerect in it, for all the ninety-six years which had left her the last\nsurvivor of the original group of Earth settlers on the world of Roye.\nShe tapped her fingers here and there on the chair's armrests, swinging\nit deftly about, and brought it to a stop beside the tea table.\n\n\"That was Susan Feeney calling,\" she reported. \"And _there_ is somebody\nelse for you who thinks I have to be taken care of! Go ahead and finish\nthe pie, Phil. Can't hurt a husky man like you. Got a couple more baking\nfor you to take along.\"\n\nPhil grinned. \"That'd be worth the trip up from Fort Roye all by\nitself.\"\n\nBeulah looked pleased. \"Not much else I can do for my great-grand nephew\nnowadays, is there?\"\n\nPhil said, after a moment, \"Have you given any further thought to--\"\n\n\"Moving down to Fort Roye?\" Beulah pursed her thin lips. \"Goodness,\nPhil, I do hate to disappoint you again, but I'd be completely out of\nplace in a town apartment.\"\n\n\"Dr. Fitzsimmons would be pleased,\" Phil remarked.\n\n\"Oh, him! Fitz is another old worry wart. What he wants is to get me\ninto the hospital. Nothing doing!\"\n\nPhil shook his head helplessly, laughed. \"After all, working a tupa\nranch--\"\n\n\"Nonsense. The ranch is just enough bother to be interesting. The\nappliances do everything anyway, and Susan is down here every morning\nfor a chat and to make sure I'm still all right. She won't admit that,\nof course, but if she thinks something should be taken care of, the\nwhole Feeney family shows up an hour later to do it. There's really no\nreason for you to be sending a dozen men up from Fort Roye every two\nmonths to harvest the tupa.\"\n\nPhil shrugged. \"No one's ever yet invented an easy way to dig up those\nroots. And the CLU's glad to furnish the men.\"\n\n\"Because you're its president?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh.\"\n\n\"It really doesn't cost you anything?\" Beulah asked doubtfully.\n\n\"Not a cent.\"\n\n       *       *       *\n\n\"Hm-m-m. Been meaning to ask you. What made you set up that ... Colonial\nLabor Union?\"\n\nPhil nodded. \"That's the official name.\"\n\n\"Why did you set it up in the first place?\"\n\n\"That's easy to answer,\" Phil said. \"On the day the planetary population\nhere touched the forty thousand mark, Roye became legally entitled to\nits labor union. Why not take advantage of it?\"\n\n\"What's the advantage?\"\n\n\"More Earth money coming in, for one thing. Of the twelve hundred CLU\nmembers we've got in Fort Roye now, seventy-six per cent were unemployed\nthis month. We'll have a compensation check from the Territorial Office\nwith the next ship coming in.\" He smiled at her expression. \"Sure, the\nboys _could_ go back to the tupa ranches. But not everyone likes that\nlife as well as you and the Feeneys.\"\n\n\"Earth government lets you get away with it?\" Beulah asked curiously.\n\"They used to be pretty tight-fisted.\"\n\n\"They still are--but it's the law. The Territorial Office also pays any\nCLU president's salary, incidentally. I don't draw too much at the\nmoment, but that will go up automatically with the membership and my\nresponsibilities.\"\n\n\"What responsibilities?\"\n\n\"We've set up a skeleton organization,\" Phil explained. \"Now, when Earth\ngovernment decides eventually to establish a big military base here,\nthey can run in a hundred thousand civilians in a couple of months and\neveryone will be fitted into the pattern on Roye without trouble or\nconfusion. That's really the reason for all the generosity.\"\n\nBeulah sniffed. \"Big base, my eye! There hasn't been six months since I\nset foot here that somebody wasn't talking about Fort Roye being turned\ninto a Class A military base pretty soon. It'll never happen, Phil.\nRoye's a farm planet, and that's what it's going to stay.\"\n\nPhil's lips twitched. \"Well, don't give up hope.\"\n\n\"_I'm_ not anxious for any changes,\" Beulah said. \"I like Roye the way\nit is.\"\n\nShe peered at a button on the go-chair's armrest which had just begun to\nput out small bright-blue flashes of light. \"Pies are done,\" she\nannounced. \"Phil, are you sure you can't stay for dinner?\"\n\nPhil looked at his watch, shook his head. \"I'd love to, but I really\nhave to get back.\"\n\n\"Then I'll go wrap up the pies for you.\"\n\nBeulah swung the go-chair around, sent it slithering up the stairs and\nout the door. Phil stood up quickly. He stepped over to the fireplace,\nopened his coat and detached a flexible, box-shaped object from the\ninner lining. He laid this object on the mantle, and turned one of three\nsmall knobs about its front edge to the right. The box promptly extruded\na supporting leg from each of its four corners, pushed itself up from\nthe mantle and became a miniature table. Phil glanced at the door\nthrough which Beulah had vanished, listened a moment, then took the\nGeest gun from the wall, laid it carefully on top of the device and\ntwisted the second dial.\n\nThe odd-looking gun began to sink slowly down through the surface of\nPhil's instrument, like a rock disappearing in mud. Within seconds it\nvanished completely; then, a moment later, it began to emerge from the\nbox's underside. Phil let the Geest gun drop into his hand, replaced it\non the wall, turned the third knob. The box withdrew its supports and\nsank down to the mantle. Phil clipped it back inside his coat, closed\nthe coat, and strolled over to the center of the room to wait for Aunt\nBeulah to return with the pies.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was curious, Phil Boles reflected as his aircar moved out over the\ncraggy, plunging coastline to the north some while later, that a few\nbold minds could be all that was needed to change the fate of a world. A\nfew minds with imagination enough to see how circumstances about them\nmight be altered.\n\nOn his left, far below, was now the flat ribbon of the peninsula, almost\nat sea level, its tip widening and lifting into the broad, rocky\npromontory on which stood Fort Roye--the only thing on the planet bigger\nand of more significance than the shabby backwoods settlements. And Fort\nRoye was neither very big nor very significant. A Class F military base\naround which, over the years, a straggling town had come into existence,\nFort Roye was a space-age trading post linking Roye's population to the\nmighty mother planet, and a station from which the otherwise vacant and\nutterly unimportant 132nd Segment of the Space Territories was\nperiodically and uneventfully patrolled. It was no more than that. Twice\na month, an Earth ship settled down to the tiny port, bringing supplies,\npurchases, occasional groups of reassigned military and civilians--the\nlatter suspected of being drawn as a rule from Earth's Undesirable\nclassification. The ship would take off some days later, with a return\nload of the few local products for which there was outside demand,\nprimarily the medically valuable tupa roots; and Fort Roye lay quiet\nagain.\n\nThe planet was not at fault. Essentially, it had what was needed to\nbecome a thriving colony in every sense. At fault was the Geest War. The\nwar had periods of flare-up and periods in which it seemed to be\nsubsiding. During the past decade it had been subsiding again. One of\nthe early flare-ups, one of the worst, and the one which brought the war\nclosest to Earth itself, was the Gunderland Battle in which Uncle\nWilliam Boles' trophy gun had been acquired. But the war never came near\nRoye. The action was all in the opposite section of the giant sphere of\nthe Space Territories, and over the years the war drew steadily farther\naway.\n\nAnd Earth's vast wealth--its manpower, materials and money--was pouring\ninto space in the direction the Geest War was moving. Worlds not a tenth\nas naturally attractive as Roye, worlds where the basic conditions for\nhuman life were just above the unbearable point, were settled and held,\nequipped with everything needed and wanted to turn them into independent\ngiant fortresses, with a population not too dissatisfied with its lot.\nWhen Earth government didn't count the expense, life could be made\nconsiderably better than bearable almost anywhere.\n\nThose were the circumstances which condemned Roye to insignificance. Not\neveryone minded. Phil Boles, native son, did mind. His inclinations were\nthose of an operator, and he was not being given an adequate opportunity\nto exercise them. Therefore, the circumstances would have to be changed,\nand the precise time to make the change was at hand. Phil himself was\nnot aware of every factor involved, but he was aware of enough of them.\nBack on Earth, a certain political situation was edging towards a\nspecific point of instability. As a result, an Earth ship which was not\none of the regular freighters had put down at Fort Roye some days\nbefore. Among its passengers were Commissioner Sanford of the\nTerritorial Office, a well-known politician, and a Mr. Ronald Black, the\npopular and enterprising owner of Earth's second largest news outlet\nsystem. They were on a joint fact-finding tour of the thinly scattered\ncolonies in this remote section of the Territories, and had wound up\neventually at the most remote of all--the 132nd Segment and Roye.\n\nThat was one factor. Just visible twenty thousand feet below\nPhil--almost directly beneath him now as the aircar made its third\nleisurely crossing of the central belt of the peninsula--was another.\nFrom here it looked like an irregular brown circle against the\npeninsula's nearly white ground. Lower down, it would have resembled\nnothing so much as the broken and half-decayed spirals of a gigantic\nsnail shell, its base sunk deep in the ground and its shattered point\nrearing twelve stories above it. This structure, known popularly as \"the\nruins\" in Fort Roye, was supposed to have been the last stronghold of a\nsemi-intelligent race native to Roye, which might have become extinct\nbarely a century before the Earthmen arrived. A factor associated with\nthe ruins again was that their investigation was the passionately\npursued hobby of First Lieutenant Norman Vaughn, Fort Roye's Science\nOfficer.\n\nAdd to such things the reason Roye was not considered in need of a\nserious defensive effort by Earth's strategists--the vast distances\nbetween it and any troubled area, and so the utter improbability that a\nGeest ship might come close enough to discover that here was another\nworld as well suited for its race as for human beings. And then a final\nfactor: the instrument attached to the lining of Phil's coat--a very\nspecial \"camera\" which now carried the contact impressions made on it by\nUncle William's souvenir gun. Put 'em all together, Phil thought\ncheerily, and they spelled out interesting developments on Roye in the\nvery near future.\n\nHe glanced at his watch again, swung the aircar about and started back\ninland. He passed presently high above Aunt Beulah's tupa ranch and that\nof the Feeney family two miles farther up the mountain, turned gradually\nto the east and twenty minutes later was edging back down the ranges to\nthe coast. Here in a wild, unfarmed region, perched at the edge of a\ncliff dropping nearly nine hundred feet to the swirling tide, was a\nsmall, trim cabin which was the property of a small, trim Fort Roye lady\nnamed Celia Adams. Celia had been shipped out from Earth six years\nbefore, almost certainly as an Undesirable, though only the Territorial\nOffice and Celia herself knew about that, the Botany Bay aspect of\nworlds like Roye being handled with some tact by Earth.\n\n       *       *       *\n\nPhil approached the cabin only as far as was necessary to make sure that\nthe dark-green aircar parked before it was one belonging to Major Wayne\nJackson, the Administration Officer and second in command at Fort\nRoye--another native son and an old acquaintance. He then turned away,\ndropped to the woods ten miles south and made a second inconspicuous\napproach under cover of the trees. There might be casual observers in\nthe area, and while his meeting with Jackson and Celia Adams today\nrevealed nothing in itself, it would be better if no one knew about it.\n\nHe grounded the car in the forest a few hundred yards from the Adams\ncabin, slung a rifle over his shoulder and set off along a game path. It\nwas good hunting territory, and the rifle would explain his presence if\nhe ran into somebody. When he came within view of the cabin, he\ndiscovered Celia and her visitor on the covered back patio, drinks\nstanding before them. Jackson was in hunting clothes. Phil remained\nquietly back among the trees for some seconds watching the two, aware of\nsomething like a last-minute hesitancy. A number of things passed slowly\nthrough his mind.\n\nWhat they planned to do was no small matter. It was a hoax which should\nhave far-reaching results, on a gigantic scale. And if Earth government\nrealized it had been hoaxed, the thing could become very unpleasant.\nThat tough-minded central bureaucracy did not ordinarily bother to\nobtain proof against those it suspected. The suspicion was enough.\nIndividuals and groups whom the shadow of doubt touched found themselves\nshunted unobtrusively into some backwater of existence and kept there.\nIt was supposed to be very difficult to emerge from such a position\nagain.\n\nIn the back of his mind, Phil had been conscious of that, but it had\nseemed an insignificant threat against the excitement arising from the\ngrandiose impudence of the plan, the perhaps rather small-boyish delight\nat being able to put something over, profitably, on the greatest power\nof all. Even now it might have been only a natural wariness that brought\nthe threat up for a final moment of reflection. He didn't, of course,\nwant to incur Earth government's disapproval. But why believe that he\nmight? On all Roye there would be only three who knew--Wayne Jackson,\nCelia Adams, and himself. All three would benefit, each in a different\nway, and all would be equally responsible for the hoax. No chance of\nindiscretion or belated qualms there. Their own interest ruled it out in\neach case.\n\nAnd from the other men now involved there was as little danger of\nbetrayal. Their gain would be vastly greater, but they had\ncorrespondingly more to lose. They would take every step required to\ninsure their protection, and in doing that they would necessarily take\nthe best of care of Phil Boles.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"How did you ever get such a thing smuggled in to Roye?\" Phil asked.\nHe'd swallowed half the drink Celia offered him at a gulp and now, a few\nminutes later, he was experiencing what might have been under different\ncircumstances a comfortable glow, but which didn't entirely erase the\nawareness of having committed himself at this hour to an irrevocable\nline of action.\n\nCelia stroked a fluffy lock of red-brown hair back from her forehead and\nglanced over at him. She had a narrow, pretty face, marred only by a\nsuggestion of hardness about the mouth--which was a little more than\nordinarily noticeable just now. Phil decided she felt something like his\nown tensions, for identical reasons. He was less certain about Major\nWayne Jackson, a big, loose-jointed man with an easy-going smile and a\npleasantly self-assured voice. The voice might be veering a trifle too\nfar to the hearty side; but that was all.\n\n\"I didn't,\" Celia said. \"It belonged to Frank. How he got it shipped in\nwith him--or after him--from Earth I don't know. He never told me. When\nhe died a couple of years ago, I took it over.\"\n\nPhil gazed reflectively at the row of unfamiliar instruments covering\nhalf the table beside her. The \"camera\" which had taken an imprint of\nthe Geest gun in Aunt Beulah's living room went with that equipment and\nhad become an interior section of the largest of the instruments. \"What\ndo you call it?\" he asked.\n\nCelia looked irritated. Jackson laughed, said, \"Why not tell him? Phil's\nfeeling like we do--this is the last chance to look everything over,\nmake sure nobody's slipped up, that nothing can go wrong. Right, Phil?\"\n\nPhil nodded. \"Something like that.\"\n\nCelia chewed her lip. \"All right,\" she said. \"It doesn't matter, I\nsuppose--compared with the other.\" She tapped one of the instruments.\n\"The set's called a duplicator. This one's around sixty years old.\nThey're classified as a forgery device, and it's decidedly illegal for a\nprivate person to build one, own one, or use one.\"\n\n\"Why that?\"\n\n\"Because forgery is ordinarily all they're good for. Frank was one of\nthe best of the boys in that line before he found he'd been put on an\nouttransfer list.\"\n\nPhil frowned. \"But if it can duplicate any manufactured object--\"\n\n\"It can. At an average expense around fifty times higher than it would\ntake to make an ordinary reproduction without it. A duplicator's no use\nunless you want a reproduction that's absolutely indistinguishable from\nthe model.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Phil was silent a moment. \"After sixty years--\"\n\n\"Don't worry, Phil,\" Jackson said. \"It's in perfect working condition.\nWe checked that on a number of samples.\"\n\n\"How do you know the copies were really indistinguishable?\"\n\nCelia said impatiently, \"Because that's the way the thing works. When\nthe Geest gun passed through the model plate, it was analyzed down to\nits last little molecule. The duplicate is now being built up from that\nanalysis. Every fraction of every element used in the original will show\nup again exactly. Why do you think the stuff's so expensive?\"\n\n       *       *       *\n\nPhil grinned. \"All right, I'm convinced. How do we get rid of the\ninscription?\"\n\n\"The gadget will handle that,\" Jackson said. \"Crack that edge off, treat\nthe cracked surface to match the wear of the rest.\" He smiled. \"Makes an\nEarth forger's life look easy, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"It is till they hook you,\" Celia said shortly. She finished her drink,\nset it on the table, added, \"We've a few questions, too, Phil.\"\n\n\"The original gun,\" Jackson said. \"Mind you, there's no slightest reason\nto expect an investigation. But after this starts rolling, our necks\nwill be out just a little until we've got rid of that particular bit of\nincriminating evidence.\"\n\nPhil pursed his lips. \"I wouldn't worry about it. Nobody but Beulah ever\nlooks at Uncle William's collection of oddities. Most of it's complete\ntrash. And probably only she and you and I know there's a Geest gun\namong the things--William's cronies all passed away before he did. But\nif the gun disappeared now, Beulah would miss it. And that--since Earth\ngovernment's made it illegal to possess Geest artifacts--_might_ create\nattention.\"\n\nJackson fingered his chin thoughtfully, said, \"Of course, there's\nalways a way to make sure Beulah didn't kick up a fuss.\"\n\nPhil hesitated. \"Dr. Fitzsimmons gives Beulah another three months at\nthe most,\" he said. \"If she can stay out of the hospital for even the\nnext eight weeks, he'll consider it some kind of miracle. That should be\nearly enough to take care of the gun.\"\n\n\"It should be,\" Jackson said. \"However, if there does happen to be an\ninvestigation before that time--\"\n\nPhil looked at him, said evenly, \"We'd do whatever was necessary. It\nwouldn't be very agreeable, but my neck's out just as far as yours.\"\n\nCelia laughed. \"That's the reason we can all feel pretty safe,\" she\nobserved. \"Every last one of us is completely selfish--and there's no\nmore dependable kind of person than that.\"\n\nJackson flushed a little, glanced at Phil, smiled. Phil shrugged. Major\nWayne Jackson, native son, Fort Roye's second in command, was scheduled\nfor the number one spot and a string of promotions via the transfer of\nthe current commander, Colonel Thayer. Their Earthside associates would\narrange for that as soon as the decision to turn Fort Roye into a Class\nA military base was reached. Phil himself could get by with the\nguaranteed retention of the CLU presidency, and a membership moving up\nyear by year to the half million mark and beyond--he could get by very,\nvery comfortably, in fact. While Celia Adams would develop a discreetly\nfirm hold on every upcoming minor racket, facilitated by iron-clad\nprotection and an enforced lack of all competitors.\n\n\"We're all thinking of Roye's future, Celia,\" Phil said amiably, \"each\nin his own way. And the future looks pretty bright. In fact, the only\npossible stumbling block I can still see is right here on Roye, and it's\nHonest Silas Thayer. If our colonel covers up the Geest gun find\ntomorrow--\"\n\nJackson grinned, shook his head. \"Leave that to me, my boy--and to our\nvery distinguished visitors from Earth. Commissioner Sanford has\narranged to be in Thayer's company on Territorial Office business all\nday tomorrow. Science Officer Vaughn is dizzy with delight because\nRonald Black and most of the newsgathering troop will inspect his\ndiggings in the ruins in the morning, with the promise of giving his\ntheories about the vanished natives of Roye a nice spread on Earth.\nBlack will happen to ask me to accompany the party. Between Black and\nSanford--and myself--Colonel Silas Thayer won't have a chance to\nsuppress the discovery of a Geest gun on Roye until the military has had\na chance to look into it fully. And the only one he can possibly blame\nfor that will be Science Officer Norm Vaughn--for whom, I'll admit, I\nfeel just a little bit sorry!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFirst Lieutenant Norman Vaughn was an intense and frustrated young man\nwhose unusually thick contact lenses and wide mouth gave him some\nresemblance to a melancholy frog. He suspected, correctly, that a good\nScience Officer would not have been transferred from Earth to Roye which\nwas a planet deficient in scientific problems of any magnitude, and\nwhere requisitions for research purposes were infrequently and\ngrudgingly granted.\n\nThe great spiraled ruin on the peninsula of Fort Roye had been Vaughn's\none solace. Several similar deserted structures were known to be on the\nplanet, but this was by far in the best condition and no doubt the most\nrecently built. To him, if to no one else, it became clear that the\nconstruction had been carried out with conscious plan and purpose, and\nhe gradually amassed great piles of notes to back up his theory that the\nvanished builders were of near-human intelligence. Unfortunately, their\nbodies appeared to have lacked hard and durable parts, since nothing\nthat could be construed as their remains was found; and what Lieutenant\nVaughn regarded as undeniable artifacts, on the level of very early\nMan's work, looked to others like chance shards and lumps of the tough,\nshell-like material of which the ruins were composed.\n\nTherefore, while Vaughn was--as Jackson had pointed out--really dizzy\nwith delight when Ronald Black, that giant of Earth's news media, first\nindicated an interest in the ruins and his theories about them, this\nfeeling soon became mixed with acute anxiety. For such a chance surely\nwould not come again if the visitors remained unconvinced by what he\nshowed them, and what--actually--did he have to show? In the morning,\nwhen the party set out, Vaughn was in a noticeably nervous frame of\nmind.\n\nTwo hours later, he burst into the anteroom of the base commander's\noffice in Fort Roye, where the warrant on duty almost failed to\nrecognize him. Lieutenant Vaughn's eyes glittered through their thick\nlenses; his face was red and he was grinning from ear to ear. He pounded\npast the startled warrant, pulled open the door to the inner office\nwhere Colonel Thayer sat with the visiting Territorial Commissioner, and\nplunged inside.\n\n\"Sir,\" the warrant heard him quaver breathlessly, \"I have the proof--the\nundeniable proof! They _were_ intelligent beings. They did _not_ die of\ndisease. They were exterminated in war! They were ... but see for\nyourself!\" There was a thud as he dropped something on the polished\ntable top between the commissioner and Colonel Thayer. \"_That_ was dug\nup just now--among their own artifacts!\"\n\nSilas Thayer was on his feet, sucking in his breath for the blast that\nwould hurl his blundering Science Officer back out of the office. What\nhalted him was an odd, choked exclamation from Commissioner Sanford. The\ncolonel's gaze flicked over to the visitor, then followed Sanford's\nstare to the object on the table.\n\nFor an instant, Colonel Thayer froze.\n\nVaughn was bubbling on. \"And, sir, I ...\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" Thayer snapped. He continued immediately, \"You say this was\nfound in the diggings in the ruins?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Yes, sir--just now! It's ...\"\n\nLieutenant Vaughn checked himself under the colonel's stare, some\ndawning comprehension of the enormous irregularities he'd committed\nshowing in his flushed face. He licked his lips uncertainly.\n\n\"You will excuse me for a moment, sir,\" Thayer said to Commissioner\nSanford. He picked the Geest gun up gingerly by its unmistakably curved\nshaft, took it over to the office safe, laid it inside and relocked the\nsafe. He then left the office.\n\n       *       *       *\n\nIn an adjoining room, Thayer rapped out Major Wayne Jackson's code\nnumber on a communicator. He heard a faint click as Jackson's wrist\nspeaker switched on, and said quickly, \"Wayne, are you in a position to\nspeak?\"\n\n\"I am at the moment,\" Jackson's voice replied cautiously.\n\nColonel Thayer said, \"Norm Vaughn just crashed in here with something he\nclaims was found in the diggings. Sanford saw it, and obviously\nrecognized it. We might be able to keep him quiet. But now some\nquestions. Was that item actually dug up just now?\"\n\n\"Apparently it was,\" Jackson said. \"I didn't see it happen--I was\ntalking to Black at the moment. But there are over a dozen witnesses who\nclaim they did see it happen, including five or six of the news agency\nmen.\"\n\n\"And they knew what it was?\"\n\n\"Enough of them did.\"\n\nThayer cursed softly. \"No chance that one of them pitched the thing into\nthe diggings for an Earthside sensation?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid not,\" Jackson said. \"It was lying in the sifter after most\nof the sand and dust had been blown away.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you call me at once?\"\n\n\"I've been holding down something like a mutiny here, Silas. Vaughn got\naway before I could stop him, but I grounded the other aircars till you\ncould decide what to do. Our visitors don't like that. Neither do they\nlike the fact that I've put a guard over the section where the find was\nmade, and haven't let them talk to Norm's work crew.\n\n\"Ronald Black and his staff have been fairly reasonable, but there's\nbeen considerable mention of military highhandedness made by the others.\nThis is the first moment I've been free.\"\n\n\"You did the right thing,\" Thayer said, \"but I doubt it will help much\nnow. Can you get hold of Ronald Black?\"\n\n\"Yes, he's over there ...\"\n\n\"Colonel Thayer?\" another voice inquired pleasantly a few seconds later.\n\n\"Mr. Black,\" the colonel said carefully, \"what occurred in the diggings\na short while ago may turn out to be a matter of great importance.\"\n\n\"That's quite obvious, sir.\"\n\n\"And that being the case,\" the colonel went on, \"do you believe it would\nbe possible to obtain a gentleman's agreement from all witnesses to\nmake no mention of this apparent discovery until the information is\nreleased through the proper channels? I'm asking for your opinion.\"\n\n\"Colonel Thayer,\" Ronald Black's voice said, still pleasantly, \"my\nopinion is that the only way you could keep the matter quiet is to\narrest every civilian present, including myself, and hold us\nincommunicado. You have your duty, and we have ours. Ours does not\ninclude withholding information from the public which may signal the\ngreatest shift in the conduct of the Geest War in the past two decades.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" Thayer said. He was silent for some seconds, and perhaps\nhe, too, was gazing during that time at a Fort Roye of the future--a\nClass A military base under his command, with Earth's great war vessels\nlined up along the length of the peninsula.\n\n\"Mr. Black,\" he said, \"please be so good as to give your colleagues this\nword from me. I shall make the most thorough possible investigation of\nwhat has occurred and forward a prompt report, along with any material\nevidence obtained, to my superiors on Earth. None of you will receive\nany other statement from me or from anyone under my command. An attempt\nto obtain such a statement will, in fact, result in the arrest of the\nperson or persons involved. Is that clear?\"\n\n\"Quite clear, Colonel Thayer,\" Ronald Black said softly. \"And entirely\nsatisfactory.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"We have known for the past eight weeks,\" the man named Cranehart said,\n\"that this was not what it appears to be ... that is, a section of a\nGeest weapon.\"\n\nHe shoved the object in question across the desk towards Commissioner\nSanford and Ronald Black. Neither of the two attempted to pick it up;\nthey glanced at it, then returned their eyes attentively to Cranehart's\nface.\n\n\"It is, of course, an excellent copy,\" Cranehart went on, \"produced with\na professional forger's equipment. As I imagine you're aware, that\nshould have made it impossible to distinguish from the original weapon.\nHowever ... there's no real harm in telling you this now ... Geest\ntechnology has taken somewhat different turns than our own. In their\nweapons they employ traces of certain elements which we are only\nbeginning to learn to maintain in stable form. That is a matter your\ngovernment has kept from public knowledge because we don't wish the\nGeests to learn from human prisoners how much information we are gaining\nfrom them.\n\n\"The instrument which made this copy naturally did not have such\nelements at its disposal. So it employed their lower homologues and in\nthat manner successfully produced an almost identical model. In fact,\nthe only significant difference is that such a gun, if it had been a\ncomplete model, could not possibly have been fired.\" He smiled briefly.\n\"But that, I think you will agree, _is_ a significant difference! We\nknew as soon as the so-called Geest gun was examined that it could only\nhave been made by human beings.\"\n\n\"Then,\" Commissioner Sanford said soberly, \"its apparent discovery on\nRoye during our visit was a deliberate hoax--\"\n\nCranehart nodded. \"Of course.\"\n\nRonald Black said, \"I fail to see why you've kept this quiet. You\nneedn't have given away any secrets. Meanwhile the wave of public\ncriticism at the government's seeming hesitancy to take action on the\ndiscovery--that is, to rush protection to the threatened Territorial\nSegments--has reached almost alarming proportions. You could have\nstopped it before it began two months ago with a single announcement.\"\n\n\"Well, yes,\" Cranehart said. \"There were other considerations.\nIncidentally, Mr. Black, we are not unappreciative of the fact that the\nnews media under your own control exercised a generous restraint in the\nmatter.\"\n\n\"For which,\" Black said dryly, \"I am now very thankful.\"\n\n\"As for the others,\" Cranehart went on, \"the government has survived\nperiods of criticism before. That is not important. The important thing\nis that the Geest War has been with us for more than a human life span\nnow ... and it becomes difficult for many to bear in mind that until its\nconclusion no acts that might reduce our ability to prosecute it can be\ntolerated.\"\n\nRonald Black said slowly, \"So you've been delaying the announcement\nuntil you could find out who was responsible for the hoax.\"\n\n\"We were interested,\" Cranehart said, \"only in the important men--the\ndangerous men. We don't care much who else is guilty of what. This, you\nsee, is a matter of expediency, not of justice.\" He looked for a moment\nat the politely questioning, somewhat puzzled faces across the desk,\nwent on, \"When you leave this room, each of you will be conducted to an\noffice where you will be given certain papers to sign. That is the first\nstep.\"\n\n       *       *       *\n\nThere was silence for some seconds. Ronald Black took a cigarette from a\nplatinum case, tapped it gently on the desk, put it to his mouth and lit\nit. Cranehart went on, \"It would have been impossible to unravel this\nparticular conspiracy if the forgery had been immediately exposed. At\nthat time, no one had taken any obvious action. Then, within a few\ndays--with the discovery apparently confirmed by our silence--normal\nmaneuverings in industry and finance were observed to be under way. If a\nmajor shift in war policy was pending, if one or more key bases were to\nbe established in Territorial Segments previously considered beyond the\nrange of Geest reconnaissance and therefore secure from attack, this\nwould be to somebody's benefit on Earth.\"\n\n\"Isn't it always?\" Black murmured.\n\n\"Of course. It's a normal procedure, ordinarily of no concern to\ngovernment. It can be predicted with considerable accuracy to what\ngroup or groups the ultimate advantage in such a situation will go. But\nin these past weeks, it became apparent that somebody else was winning\nout ... somebody who could have won out only on the basis of careful and\nextensive preparation for this very situation.\n\n\"That was abnormal, and it was the appearance of an abnormal pattern for\nwhich we had been waiting. We find there are seven men involved. These\nmen will be deprived of the advantage they have gained.\"\n\nRonald Black shook his head, said, \"You're making a mistake, Cranehart.\nI'm signing no papers.\"\n\n\"Nor I,\" Sanford said thickly.\n\nCranehart rubbed the side of his nose with a fingertip, said\nmeditatively, \"You won't be forced to. Not directly.\" He nodded at the\nwindow. \"On the landing flange out there is an aircar. It is possible\nthat this aircar will be found wrecked in the mountains some four\nhundred miles north of here early tomorrow morning. Naturally, we have a\nsatisfactory story prepared to cover such an eventuality.\"\n\nSanford whitened slowly. He said, \"So you'd resort to murder!\"\n\nCranehart was silent for a few seconds. \"Mr. Sanford,\" he said then,\n\"you, as a member of the Territorial Office, know very well that the\nGeest War has consumed over four hundred million human lives to date.\nThat is the circumstance which obliges your government to insist on your\nco-operation. I advise you to give it.\"\n\n\"But you have no proof! You have nothing but surmises--\"\n\n\"Consider this,\" Cranehart said. \"A conspiracy of the type I have\ndescribed constitutes a capital offense under present conditions. Are\nyou certain that you would prefer us to continue to look for proof?\"\n\nRonald Black said in a harsh voice, \"And what would the outcome be if we\ndid choose to co-operate?\"\n\n\"Well, we can't afford to leave men of your type in a position of\ninfluence, Mr. Black,\" Cranehart said amiably. \"And you understand, I'm\nsure, that it would be entirely too difficult to keep you under proper\nsurveillance on Earth--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCelia Adams said from outside the cabin door, \"I think it is them, Phil.\nBoth cars have started to circle.\"\n\nPhil Boles came to the door behind her and looked up. It was early\nevening--Roye's sun just down, and a few stars out. The sky above the\nsea was still light. After a moment, he made out the two aircars moving\nin a wide, slow arc far overhead. He glanced at his watch.\n\n\"Twenty minutes late,\" he remarked. \"But it couldn't be anyone else. And\nif they hadn't all come along, they wouldn't have needed two cars.\" He\nhesitated. \"We can't tell how they're going to take this, Celia, but\nthey may have decided already that they could make out better without\nus.\" He nodded towards the edge of the cliff. \"Short way over there,\nand a long drop to the water! So don't let them surprise you.\"\n\nShe said coldly, \"I won't. And I've used guns before this.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't doubt it.\" Phil reached back behind the door, picked up a\nflarelight standing beside a heavy machine rifle, and came outside. He\npointed the light at the cars and touched the flash button briefly three\ntimes. After a moment, there were two answering flashes from the leading\ncar.\n\n\"So Wayne Jackson's in the front car,\" Phil said. \"Now let's see what\nthey do.\" He returned the light to its place behind the door and came\nout again, standing about twelve feet to one side of Celia. The aircars\nvanished inland, came back at treetop level a few minutes later. One\nsettled down quietly between the cabin and the edge of the cliff, the\nother following but dropping to the ground a hundred yards away, where\nit stopped. Phil glanced over at Celia, said softly, \"Watch that one!\"\nShe nodded almost imperceptibly, right hand buried in her jacket pocket.\n\nThe near door of the car before them opened. Major Wayne Jackson,\nhatless and in hunting clothes, climbed out, staring at them. He said,\n\"Anyone else here?\"\n\n\"Just Celia and myself,\" Phil said.\n\nJackson turned, spoke into the car and two men, similarly dressed, came\nout behind him. Phil recognized Ronald Black and Sanford. The three\nstarted over to the cabin, stopped a dozen feet away.\n\nJackson said sardonically, \"Our five other previous Earthside partners\nare in the second car. In spite of your insistence to meet the whole\ngroup, they don't want you and Celia to see their faces. They don't wish\nto be identifiable.\" He touched his coat lapel. \"They'll hear what we're\nsaying over this communicator and they could talk to you, but won't\nunless they feel it's necessary. You'll have to take my word for it that\nwe're all present.\"\n\n\"That's good enough,\" Phil said.\n\n\"All right,\" Jackson went on, \"now what did you mean by forcing us to\ntake this chance? Let me make it plain. Colonel Thayer hasn't been\naccused of collaborating in the Roye gun hoax, but he got a black eye\nout of the affair just the same. And don't forget that a planet with\ncolonial status is technically under martial law, which includes the\ncivilians. If Silas Thayer can get his hands on the guilty persons, the\nsituation will become a lot more unpleasant than it already is.\"\n\n       *       *       *\n\nPhil addressed Ronald Black, \"Then how about you two? When you showed up\nhere again on a transfer list, Thayer must have guessed why.\"\n\nBlack shook his head. \"Both of us exercised the privilege of changing\nour names just prior to the outtransfer. He doesn't know we're on Roye.\nWe don't intend to let him find out.\"\n\nPhil asked, \"Did you make any arrangements to get out of Roye again?\"\n\n\"Before leaving Earth?\" Black showed his teeth in a humorless smile.\n\"Boles, you have no idea of how abruptly and completely the government\nmen cut us off from our every resource! We were given no opportunity to\ndraw up plans to escape from exile, believe me.\"\n\nPhil glanced over at Celia. \"In that case,\" he said, a little thickly,\n\"we'd better see if we can't draw some up together immediately.\"\n\nJackson asked, staring, \"What are you talking about, Phil? Don't think\nfor a moment Silas Thayer isn't doing what he can to find out who put\nthat trick over on him. I'm not at all sure he doesn't suspect me. And\nif he can tie it to us, it's our neck. If you have some crazy idea of\ngetting off the planet now, let me tell you that for the next few years\nwe can't risk making a single move! If we stay quiet, we're safe. We--\"\n\n\"I don't think we'd be safe,\" Phil said.\n\nOn his right, Celia Adams added sharply, \"The gentleman in the other car\nwho's just started to lower that window had better raise it again! If\nhe's got good eyesight, he'll see I have a gun pointed at him. Yes,\nthat's much better! Go on, Phil.\"\n\n\"Have you both gone out of your minds?\" Jackson demanded.\n\n\"No,\" Celia said. She laughed with a sudden shakiness in her tone,\nadded, \"Though I don't know why we haven't! We've thought of the\npossibility that the rest of you might feel it would be better if Phil\nand I weren't around any more, Wayne.\"\n\n\"That's nonsense!\" Jackson said.\n\n\"Maybe. Anyway, don't try it. You wouldn't be doing yourselves a favor\neven if it worked. Better listen now.\"\n\n\"Listen to what?\" Jackson demanded exasperatedly. \"I'm telling you it\nwill be all right, if we just don't make any mistakes. The only real\npieces of evidence were your duplicator and the original gun. Since\nwe're rid of those--\"\n\n\"We're not rid of the gun, Wayne,\" Phil said. \"I still have it. I\nhaven't dared get rid of it.\"\n\n\"You ... what do you mean?\"\n\n\"I was with Beulah in the Fort Roye hospital when she died,\" Phil said.\nHe added to Ronald Black, \"That was two days after the ship brought the\nseven of you in.\"\n\nBlack nodded, his eyes alert. \"Major Jackson informed me.\"\n\n\"She was very weak, of course, but quite lucid,\" Phil went on. \"She\ntalked a good deal--reminiscing, and in a rather happy vein. She finally\nmentioned the Geest gun, and how Uncle William used to keep us boys ...\nWayne and me ... spell-bound with stories about the Gunderland Battle,\nand how he'd picked the gun up there.\"\n\nJackson began, \"And what does--\"\n\n\"He didn't get the gun there,\" Phil said. \"Beulah said Uncle William\ncame in from Earth with the first shipment of settlers and was never off\nRoye again in his life.\"\n\n\"He ... then--\"\n\nPhil said, \"Don't you get it? He found the gun right here on Roye.\nBeulah thought it was awfully funny. William was an old fool, she said,\nbut the best liar she'd ever known. He came in with the thing one day\nafter he'd been traipsing around the back country, and said it looked\n'sort of' like pictures of Geest guns he'd seen, and that he was going\nto put the inscription on it and have some fun now and then.\" Phil took\na deep breath. \"Uncle William found it lying in a pile of ashes where\nsomeone had made camp a few days before. He figured it would have been a\nplanetary speedster some rich sportsmen from Earth had brought in for a\ntaste of outworld hunting on Roye, and that one of them had dumped the\nbroken oddball gun into the fire to get rid of it.\n\n\"That was thirty-six years ago. Beulah remembered it happened a year\nbefore I was born.\"\n\nThere was silence for some seconds. Then Ronald Black said evenly, \"And\nwhat do you conclude, Boles?\"\n\nPhil looked at him. \"I'd conclude that Norm Vaughn was right about there\nhaving been some fairly intelligent creatures here once. The Geests ran\ninto them and exterminated them as they usually do. That might have been\na couple of centuries back. Then, thirty-six years ago, one of their\nscouts slipped in here without being spotted, found human beings on the\nplanet, looked around a little and left again.\"\n\nHe took the Geest gun from his pocket, hefted it in his hand. \"We have\nthe evidence here,\" he said. \"We had it all the time and didn't know\nit.\"\n\nRonald Black said dryly, \"We may have the evidence. But we have no\nslightest proof at all now that that's what it is.\"\n\n\"I know it,\" Phil said. \"Now Beulah's gone ... well, we couldn't even\nprove that William Boles never left the planet, for that matter. There\nweren't any records to speak of being kept in the early days.\" He was\nsilent a moment. \"Supposing,\" he said, \"we went ahead anyway. We hand\nthe gun in, with the story I just told you--\"\n\nJackson made a harsh, laughing sound. \"That would hang us fast, Phil!\"\n\n\"And nothing else?\"\n\n\"Nothing else,\" Black said with finality. \"Why should anyone believe the\nstory now? There are a hundred more likely ways in which a Geest gun\ncould have got to Roye. The gun is tangible evidence of the hoax, but\nthat's all.\"\n\nPhil asked, \"Does anybody ... including the cautious gentlemen in the\ncar over there ... disagree with that?\"\n\nThere was silence again. Phil shrugged, turned towards the cliff edge,\ndrew his arm back and hurled the Geest gun far up and out above the sea.\nStill without speaking, the others turned their heads to watch it fall\ntowards the water, then looked back at him.\n\n\"I didn't think very much of that possibility myself,\" Phil said\nunsteadily. \"But one of you might have. All right--_we_ know the Geests\nknow we're here. But we won't be able to convince anyone else of it.\nAnd, these last few years, the war seems to have been slowing down\nagain. In the past, that's always meant the Geests were preparing a big\nnew surprise operation.\n\n\"So the other thing now--the business of getting off Roye. It can't be\ndone unless some of you have made prior arrangements for it Earthside.\nIf it had been possible in any other way, I'd have been out of this\nplace ten years ago.\"\n\nRonald Black said carefully, \"Very unfortunately, Boles, no such\narrangements have been made.\"\n\n\"Then there it is,\" Phil said. \"I suppose you see now why I thought this\ngroup should get together. The ten masterminds! Well, we've hoaxed\nourselves into a massive jam. Now let's find out if there's any possible\nway--_any possibility at all!_--of getting out of it again.\"\n\nA voice spoke tinnily from Jackson's lapel communicator. \"Major\nJackson?\"\n\n\"Yes?\" Jackson said.\n\n\"Please persuade Miss Adams that it is no longer necessary to point her\ngun at this car. In view of the stated emergency, we feel we had better\ncome out now--and join the conference.\"\n\n       *       *       *\n\nFROM THE RECORDS OF THE TERRITORIAL OFFICE, 2345 A.D.\n\n... It is generally acknowledged that the Campaign of the 132nd Segment\nmarked the turning point of the Geest War. Following the retransfer of\nColonel Silas Thayer to Earth, the inspired leadership of Major Wayne\nJackson and his indefatigable and exceptionally able assistants, notably\nCLU President Boles, transformed the technically unfortified and thinly\nsettled key world of Roye within twelve years into a virtual death trap\nfor any invading force. Almost half of the Geest fleet which eventually\narrived there was destroyed in the first week subsequent to the landing,\nand few of the remaining ships were sufficiently undamaged to be able to\nlift again. The enemy relief fleet, comprising an estimated forty per\ncent of the surviving Geest space power, was intercepted in the 134th\nSegment by the combined Earth forces under Admiral McKenna's command and\nvirtually annihilated.\n\nIn the following two years ...\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Analog_ August 1962.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
